[00:06:22] <Sven_vB> in standard American English, if there are several good ways to do something, and several bad ways to do something, is the ranking "least bad" implicitly limited to the bad ways, or would "least bad" coincide with the best way?
[00:07:20] *** Quits: The_Blode_ (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[00:09:26] <CuriosTiger> It's not quite that simple. It can be a little context-dependent, but generally "least bad" implies that all of the options have negative consequences, and that "least bad" is the option with the fewest negative consequences.
[00:10:06] <LuisR14> well, if the best is also bad then it'd be the least of them xP
[00:10:17] <CuriosTiger> It doesn't necessarily mean it's the best solution. It might be, but it might not be.
[00:10:36] <CuriosTiger> LuisR14: Not necessarily. One may be willing to accept more negative consequences to provide a better solution.
[00:11:15] <LuisR14> by definition it's what i just said
[00:11:17] <CuriosTiger> For example, the "least bad" option for a road across the Everglades may be a simple two-lane road, but the best solution from a traffic management perspective may be a divided four-lane freeway.
[00:11:28] <CuriosTiger> I disagree.
[00:11:59] <LuisR14> defining by the word, man
[00:12:00] <CuriosTiger> "Best" isn't only measured in the absence of negative consequences, but also in the accomplishment of positive ones.
[00:12:32] <Sven_vB> yeah, it came up because I'm a native German speaker, and for us the literal translation would mean the best option but implying that you're still not happy with the best.
[00:13:42] <Sven_vB> thanks for your explanations. :)
[00:13:46] <CuriosTiger> Sven_vB: It's similar in English, and the same context caveat applies in German, I think. "Die wenigst schlechte Lösung" und "Die beste Lösung" sind nicht immer gleich.
[00:13:50] <LuisR14> if it's not the best anymore, then misrepresenting
[00:14:17] *** Joins: mdogg (~mdogg@user/mdogg)
[00:14:29] <CuriosTiger> LuisR14: "Best" does not have a uniform definition, so context is important.
[00:14:42] <CuriosTiger> What's best for one person could be catastrophic for another.
[00:14:46] <LuisR14> best of the worst
[00:14:49] <Sven_vB> CuriosTiger, that idea surprises me. do you have original German examples where someone makes a difference between the best and the least bad option=
[00:14:50] <Sven_vB> ?
[00:15:21] <Sven_vB> could be regional maybe, but still news to me
[00:15:22] <CuriosTiger> The best solution for a new railway may be a straight line, but it's catastrophic for you if your house has to be demolished to make room. In which case the "least worst" solution may well be the one that requires the fewest demolitions, or it may be not to build the railway at all.
[00:16:36] <CuriosTiger> Sven_vB: I don't think I do, no. I could try to google for some, but so can you. The examples I gave above in English are contrived examples to try to illustrate that "best" can mean different things to different people.

[00:18:29] <Sven_vB> a few decades even
[00:19:04] <CuriosTiger> Sven_vB: Well, LuisR14 disagrees with me in English. *shrug*
[00:19:46] <Sven_vB> yeah, I can easily accept that English speakers can have different opinion on that
[00:19:59] <LuisR14> well, I agree, when taken with that in mind :p
[00:20:00] <CuriosTiger> I think we can all agree, however, that "least bad" at least implies that there are negative consequences.
[00:21:06] <CuriosTiger> Also, is it bad that I couldn't even translate "solution" to German in my mind without thinking of "die endgültige Lösung"?
[00:21:53] <Sven_vB> it might be a hint of suppressed thoughts :P
[00:22:06] * LuisR14 knows not what to think of that

[00:24:59] <Sven_vB> I see lots of differences between the current situation and the one before WWII. let's just hope certain politicians are smarter than they present as.
[00:28:19] <CuriosTiger> Sven_vB: Amen to that.
[00:29:33] <CuriosTiger> And yeah, there are lots of differences. Different players, different aggressors. But the same signs of isolationism, divisive rhetoric and the rise of autocrats. It's scary.

[03:30:27] *** Joins: Sven_vB (~sven@user/sven-vb/x-2094958)
[03:30:46] <mdogg> That column on the right really reduces the area you have for your text.
[03:32:43] <mdogg> The first two items you have under "hobbies" can be included under "Profile" since those are all related to your goal professionally.  I would suggest deleting the rest.

[03:37:09] <Hazey_Dream> If I'm not mistaken, 1 is for geometric degrees of the sun, 1 is for the brightness of the sun's light, & is 1 for radiation from the sun.
[03:37:12] <mdogg> Under "Education", I don't think you need to list which courses you took.  The type of degree, the discipline, the school and the years attended will suffice.  If the hiring manager wants more details about your education they can always ask during an interview.

[03:45:21] <mdogg> AsenMx: That does look better but I strongly suggest removing your photograph.  A resume is used used to see if a candidate has the skills and competencies necessary in order to fill a position.  If they do then an interview will be scheduled.  What the candidate looks like is not relevant.  To me, it's not professional to include a photograph.
[03:46:07] <mdogg> Besides, if a hiring manager is *really* curious, you have included links to your profile so they can look you up if they really wanted to.

[04:46:30] <AsenMx> mdogg, I agree I worked in different companies 5, 50, 17000, 280000 people and trust me in a small startup it is great to learn new things
[04:47:01] <mdogg> There are different dynamics to large and small companies.  Advantages and disadvantages to both.  But I don't think it's safe to assume that working for a small orginization automatically means that you will have more opportunities to grow, especially if you end up working for somebody who doesn't like change and isn't interested in listening to new ideas.
[04:47:18] <mdogg> Oh, startups.  Yeah, that's a bit different.
[04:47:40] <mdogg> Startups cannot afford to be closed-minded.
[04:48:25] <xau_> ok AsenMx.

[04:56:04] <AsenMx> xau_, mdogg have a question, how to put it in the resume that im kind of looking foyou know nerds style of work just bunch of fat nerds sitting in a basement doing computer stuff? can i word this somehow without sounding like antisocial guy and no go for big tech companies?
[04:57:39] <mdogg> haha - 
[04:59:05] <mdogg> When you use your resume to apply for positions, ideally it will get you an interview.  You should be able to get a good idea of the dynamics of the company and team at that point.  
[04:59:17] <xau_> I'm sure it can be managed.
[04:59:33] <mdogg> I don't think it's necessary to call it out on your resume, though.
[04:59:34] <xau_> Let's see what we can come up with.  mdogg?
[04:59:39] <xau_> hmm
[04:59:44] * xau_ thinks
[05:00:04] <mdogg> Well, doing something like that would only further limit his options.
[05:00:27] <xau_> I see the point.
[05:00:55] <xau_> To sell it as an authenticity report, without closing a door, that is the challenge.
[05:00:55] <AsenMx> I know :( I was hoping to word it in a good way that it won't actually limit my options, but when the right people see it they will know what i mean.
[05:01:00] <xau_> Quite right!
[05:01:25] <xau_> I'm sure, I'm sure, AsenMx.  How would _you_ do it?
[05:01:31] <mdogg> The interview is where the hiring manager has a chance to learn about the prospective employee, but it is also the place where the prospective employee gets to learn about the company and the dynamics of the origination.  Many times there is a second interview with different people, which would be an additional opportunity for the prospective employee to learn even more..
[05:01:47] <xau_> Talk to me, AsenMx.  I'm the hiring interviever.
[05:02:13] <xau_> Tell me that you just plain work every working moment.
[05:02:24] <xau_> And you like it that way.
[05:02:29] <xau_> Be that guy.
[05:02:41] <AsenMx> mdogg, you are 100% correct however, whenever i look for a job i do aruond 50 intervies in 2 weeks 3-5 interviews a day... and its mostly  waste of time

[05:05:49] <xau_> As for soft selling it, perhaps another line of fluff for the intro, along the lines of: "I thrive in intense and focused work environments". 
[05:05:57] <mdogg> Then you should create a specific category above "Profile" titled, "Objective" and define what that is.  It should be a short sentence or phrase, nothing more.

[21:06:41] <CuriosTiger> I spent two hours on the phone with Sydney this morning.
[21:07:07] <CuriosTiger> Our Sydney office is in trouble. One engineer is leaving the company, one engineer is moving to Singapore and one engineer is moving back to the US.
[21:07:11] <CuriosTiger> They have three network engineers.

[21:21:53] <Sven_vB> kurahaupo, thanks for letting me know.
[21:23:58] <Sven_vB> darsie, I had thought "advertize" with z was correct, but dict.leo.org only knows it with s, so not sure. the space after the channel name is probably just for technical reasons, and I think it's non-standard grammar. (I'm not a native speaker of English.)

[21:48:05] <TimMc> I believe that's British vs. American English.
[21:48:06] <twb> Sven_vB: "advertise" is formed from "advertisement", not from "advert"
[21:49:04] <TimMc> twb: "advertisement" is probably originally from "advertise" (or an older form of the latter)...
[21:49:20] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[21:49:30] <twb> hrm
[21:49:38] <twb> "From Middle English advertisen, from Anglo-Norman advertir (“to inform”), avertir, Middle French advertir, avertir (“to warn, give notice to”), with the ending assimilated to -ise, -ize and probably influenced by the noun advertisement. Compare also advert."
[21:51:06] <twb> in general -ise is a wrongness caused by French-speaking invaders.  Americans fixed it, but by that time the British hated the Americans even more than they hated the French, so they kept the broken out of spite.
[21:51:16] <twb> Except, of course, in en-GB-oxendict
[21:51:32] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling
[21:51:50] <TimMc> Apparently "advertise" is much more common and -ize is mostly archaic.
[21:53:00] <twb> "The Oxford use of ‑ize does not extend to the spelling of words not traced to the Greek ‑izo suffix. One group of such words is those ending in ‑lyse, such as analyse, paralyse and catalyse, which come from the Greek verb λύω, lyo, the perfective (aorist) stem of which is ‑lys-: for these ‑lyse is the more etymological spelling. Others include arise, chastise, disguise, prise (in the sense of open), re
[21:53:00] <twb> vise and
[21:53:00] <twb> televise ,^[7] though the last is a hybrid word.
[21:53:22] <twb> Wikipedia doesn't call out "advertise" explicitly; I always assumed it was part of that last list of exceptions
[21:55:41] <TimMc> Wiktionary mentions the Greek thing.
