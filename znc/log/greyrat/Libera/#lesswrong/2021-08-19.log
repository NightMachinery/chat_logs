[00:28:19] <dbohdan> saturn2: Even if it's true on average, I'd still expect it vary by medium and genre.  E.g., a fair murder mystery should be less fun when spoiled.
[00:28:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Spoilers do too reduce enjoyment
[00:28:45] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: the FOXDIE plotline is the one i'm specifically referring to, introduced in MGS (as in, the first 3d one, and it plays a part in 4 too)

[00:32:44] <Robomot> Spoilers Really Can Ruin Your Movie Experience | Live Science (Scientists find that spoilers really do reduce enjoyment, in contrast to earlier research suggesting that spoilers can improve an experience.)
[00:32:47] <pompolic> but there is in fact a trope that i would point out: Fridge Logic/Fridge Brilliance
[00:33:10] <pompolic> i think the effect of spoilers is probably contingent on how linear a medium is
[00:33:23] <pompolic> spoilers are an artifact of Big Movie
[00:34:09] <pompolic> then again i also sometimes read paragraphs out of order just in case they are doing some attention-guiding sleight of hand
[00:34:16] <LeoTal> I can only read a book for the first time once, whereas I can reread it many times. Spoilers let me reread but deprive me of the first reading.
[00:34:42] <pompolic> there's also the thing where you see foreshadowing on the second read/watch
[00:35:10] <pompolic> i also have moments of "that's a plotho-- wait no it still makes sense"
[00:35:30] <pompolic> The Dev Team Thinks of Everything, but for stories
[00:35:38] <LeoTal> Right, so spoilers are a strict loss
[00:35:57] <pompolic> i dunno, i think it's somewhat contingent
[00:36:17] <pompolic> but i do think that if someone's writing is reliant on being consumed linearly, it's probably not very deep
[00:36:42] <LeoTal> Trivial counterexample: _Infinite Jest_
[00:37:08] <dbohdan> Interesting how before I heard of this "spoilers don't reduce enjoyment" research (here?), I atypical-minded hard on spoilers.  I thought, "I don't mind spoilers too much, but I'm weird, so other people must.  Why would they be so concerned about spoilers otherwise?"  Now my opinion on spoilers is basically ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
[00:37:47] <LeoTal> Chapter 1 when it's the first thing you read, and Chapter 1 on rereading, are very different. _Infinite Jest_ is, uh, not linear
[00:37:55] <pompolic> i'm just mad at Spoiler Culture
[00:38:07] <pompolic> it's clearly not an unambiguous bad
[00:38:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Spoilers are bad though
[00:38:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is fact
[00:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, it is an unambiguous bad
[00:39:29] <pompolic> this is probably a taste argument in disguise
[00:40:11] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: Do you agree that how severe spoilers are depends on the genre?
[00:40:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Uh, what do you mean?
[00:40:43] <LeoTal> The status quo is a culture of having clearly marked spoilers that you can choose to read or not. This seems optimal: people like you can go read them, and others can avoid them. Getting mad that your tastes aren't universal does not strike me as the height of reason.
[00:40:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[00:41:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pretty much that is the very obviously correct view
[00:41:42] <pompolic> i agree with that being at least a local optimum
[00:41:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> As far as "spoilers don't reduce enjoyment", I just don't believe that so-called "research"

[00:42:21] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: A plot spoiler can reduce one's enjoyment of a mystery more than of a tone piece, for example

[00:42:55] <dbohdan> Something that's focused on conveying a mood
[00:42:55] <kuudes> basicly it just checks there are no surprises there, and I expect the vaccine will get company clearance in december
[00:43:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Example??
[00:44:19] <pompolic> i have this impression that the central example of how people relate to spoilers is "not telling you even when you ask", which is what i'm actually slightly mad about
[00:44:40] <pompolic> unilaterally making that decision one way or another, rather than giving options
[00:45:19] <LeoTal> One of those bazillion "English professor considers cheating on wife" stories. He might or might not stick his dick in the hot young coed, or the story might end without resolving it either way, but that's not the point, the point is that you watch him smoke cigarettes and gaze out of windows and philosophise about the meaninglessness of life.
[00:45:36] <pompolic> the evidence i have for this is uhhhh vaguely recalling there being some big deal about Marvel movie spoilers a year or two ago
[00:46:03] <LeoTal> Aren't all Marvel movies notable enough for Wikipedia? If so you can just look up the plot
[00:46:37] <pompolic> in the window between premier and everyone having watched it
[00:46:42] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: Maybe "Poltarnees, Beholder of Ocean" by Dunsany?  It contains a binary question ("Will X happen?") that can be spoiled, but it doesn't matter much, because the world and mood are what the story is about.
[00:46:46] <pompolic> but perhaps I'm mistaking fandom for general culture
[00:46:47] <kuudes> I read movies from wikipedia often
[00:46:54] <kuudes> saves time compared to watching them
[00:47:27] <dbohdan> Or LeoTal's example
[00:48:09] <LeoTal> For what purpose? This strikes me as similar to "I sent my wife a link to the wikipedia article on foreplay, then to the one on intercourse; saves time compared to actually doing those"

[01:07:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: As for LeoTal's example, uh... I guess. I can't imagine wanting to read something like that. So is the point that if it's not worth reading, it's not worth not-spoiling?
[01:07:51] <rsaarelm> Something like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was actually good, I liked watching that as an actual movie, and it wouldn't make sense to read the wikipedia plot since it wasn't a twisty plot movie.

[01:27:47] <rsaarelm> For example The Orphan sounds like a movie that would be pretty boring to watch, but just reading the laconic plot spoiler is hilarious.
[01:33:23] <LeoTal> I think if I watched it, the twist would land, whereas when reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I have to diagram it
[01:34:26] <rsaarelm> I guess I also don't really get the "what's my emotion when experiencing this?" as an important thing, compared to the "what's the pattern here?"
[01:36:04] <rsaarelm> "Did I do honest work to figure out the pattern on my own because that helps build up my pattern-detection powers instead of just having it told to me" makes a lot more sense than "did I feel the emotional beats with the intended sequence, timing and intensity"
[01:37:28] <rsaarelm> But the former is more of a thing in puzzle adventure games, math textbooks and straussian reading on the influence of the reptilian illuminati on world financial history than for movies.

[02:52:09] <ggreer> I have not looked at the code
[02:52:10] <LeoTal> I thought it was *just* about transphobia, so it wouldn't flag a fraudster, for the same reason that transphobic tweets aren't listed in the county mugshot database

[02:54:13] <LeoTal> I'm honestly unsure why anyone wants this extension, but more power to them
[02:54:15] <ggreer> so far, green has perfectly correlated with "I got into a twitter argument with them" and red has perfectly correlated with "pretty chill"

[06:33:12] <gwern> interesting. the cifar experiment proves, by using a smaller model to deterministicall generate labels, that the powerlaw doesn't come from randomness in the data nor from the models being too small/simpler than the data-generating process, but that they learn so slowly because they are badly optimized
[06:34:12] <gwern> 'This is quite embarrassing (and encouraging), implying that deep learning in its current form may actually be far from the lower limits of attainable error, where the lower limit would be realizable-error and noise (when present) dominated. These findings point not only to a fundamental gap but also chart a path to how one may close it.'
[06:37:05] <gwern> 'For any finite model in the non-realizable case, we will thus be solely model limited in our error (barring for learning deficiency). In other words, beyond the Nyquist data size, further data would not be needed (except for the averaging of noise) — only a larger model to reduce error. However, even if indeed the bandlimited data hypothesis holds, current learning algorithms are ill...

They do not make use of the stronger band limit property and — case in point — suffer from the uncertainty noise source which gives rise to the power-laws established in the preceding chapters.

There is no exact translation into English of this Spanish term, but it signifies a combination of dignity, elan vital, courage and "copability." An example that comes to mind is that of Rene Barrientos, who was at the time president of Bolivia. It appears that a political scandal
[09:03:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  arose when a couple of military aviators died when their parachutes failed to open. It was adduced by the political opposition that Barrientos was profiteering off of second rate parachutes discarded by the US
[09:03:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Rather than arguing the point, the president decreed a press conference at dawn the following morning. He arrived promptly, dressed in full flying gear, and told the assembled reporters to pick out a spokesman. When this was done the president escorted the spokesman to the storehouse in which all parachutes were stored and had him pick out any one at random. When this was done the president donned the parachute and climbed
[09:03:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  aboard a two-seater jet fighter plane, piloting it himself. He circled the field, and when ready, rolled on his back and bailed out. In the parachute he guided himself to a stand-up landing in front of the press corps, whereupon he shrugged out of his harness and said, "Now, let's everybody get back to work."

[10:11:25] <quanticle> Lol, today's hilarious Linux experience
[10:11:34] <quanticle> Resumed from sleep
[10:11:38] <quanticle> And no more bluetooth
[10:12:00] <adiabatic> I knew I was in for fun when you said 'resumed from sleep'
[10:12:02] <quanticle> Warms my heart this does; I thought Linux was *boring* these days, but no, it still has surprises :D
[10:12:20] <adiabatic> linux is boring only if you run it on a desktop or headless
[10:12:26] <adiabatic> headless there's no audio fun to worry about 
[10:12:33] <quanticle> systemctl restart bluetooth does nothing, of course

[10:13:25] <nshepperd2> bluetooth has always been totally fucked ime. no idea how any of the developers think it works okay
[10:14:19] <saturn2> removing and reloading the driver module might help
[10:14:50] <Ralith> that is the specific hardware peripheral analog of a reboot
[10:14:55] <Ralith> good general tactic
[10:15:01] <quanticle> saturn2: Oh, good idea
[10:15:27] <saturn2> you should be grateful that you have both bluetooth and suspend. both at the same time would be asking a lot
[10:15:41] <quanticle> Hahaha, I type "linux reload" and the next word that Google autocompletes is "bluetooth"
[10:15:44] <quanticle> lol
[10:15:52] <rmmh> quanticle: when I switch my usb devices to my other machine about 30% of the time it complains about USB not having sufficient bandwidth
[10:15:56] <rmmh> I have no idea why
[10:16:00] <adiabatic> this is why unix nerds bought macs
[10:16:04] <rmmh> it's usb 3.0, and just a few hid devices and a webcam
[10:16:07] <adiabatic> this is literally why
[10:17:04] <saturn2> bluetooth is always buggy even with proprietary shit
[10:17:15] <quanticle> idk worked fine when I was running Windows
[10:17:21] <quanticle> Literally... not a problem even once
[10:17:27] <nshepperd2> isn't there some thing where attaching a usb 1.0 device to a usb 3.0 hub forces it out of usb 3.0 mode
[10:17:38] <Ralith> my partner has no end of complaints about trying to get his phone to talk to his car stereo bluetoothwise
[10:17:44] <Ralith> bluetooth is just really hairy
[10:17:45] <nshepperd2> and hid devices are almost always usb 1.0 because they don't 'need' speed
[10:18:46] <quanticle> In fact, I even had more problems with MacOS and bluetooth than I had with Windows and bluetooth. On my work Mac, before the latest MacOS update, putting the Mac to sleep wouldn't disconnect the bluetooth device. You'd have to manually disconnect before sleeping. Apple did fix that in the latest patch, though.
[10:19:03] <quanticle> Windows and bluetooth, on the other hand, smooth sailing from the get-go.
[10:19:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> My flip phone pairs with my car automically and seamlessly after having configured it once
[10:19:34] <quanticle> Close lid, bluetooth disconnects all devices. Open lid, all paired devices reconnect if they're not already connected to something else
[10:19:38] <adiabatic> quanticle: I thought macOS had a setting for "wake on bluetooth". I take it it was busted?
[10:19:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've even turned its BT off, then later turned it back on, and it (and the car) kept the setting and resumed auto-pairing seamlessly
[10:19:52] <quanticle> adiabatic: Yeah, it was busted but it is now fixed.
[10:20:17] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I thought you were like a Phone Amish 
[10:20:24] <quanticle> You... acknowledge Bluetooth?
[10:20:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> My phone has BT capability
[10:20:35] <adiabatic> quanticle: I'm a little surprised but not totally surprised
[10:20:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> So does the Corolla
[10:20:38] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[10:20:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> If it works flawlessly, why not use it, right?
[10:20:57] <adiabatic> are there different names for more- and less-technophobic amish
[10:21:14] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: why don't you have/want a smartphone, again?
[10:21:20] <saturn2> it's possible to get lucky with BT + linux also. just luck of the draw whether something in the stack tickles something else's bugs
[10:21:23] <quanticle> Yeah, I have Android Auto, so my phone connects to my car via a cable.
[10:22:00] <quanticle> Okay, brb rebooting
[10:22:43] <adiabatic> You _must_ have a well-thought-out reason.
[10:23:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Smartphones are evil and bad
[10:23:07] <adiabatic> Why?
[10:23:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm sure you know why
[10:23:57] <adiabatic> They're evil and bad when other people have them, clearly. However, I seem to be able to resist the worst parts of them because my default answer to "would you let me send you notifications?" is "no"
[10:24:10] <adiabatic> You seem to be able to do the same
[10:25:11] <adiabatic> and I get very useful tools like internet-connected GPS
[10:25:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> One time I was talking with an acquaintance of mine (one of those "we meet once every whatever at weddings and such") and it developed that I don't have a smartphone. He was amazed at this news. "Why don't you have one?", he asked, glancing down at his phone. "I couldn't give up mine; they're like crack cocaine!"
[10:25:35] <adiabatic> the killer app for upgrading from iPods touch to a real 5S was "navigate from home to point B, then navigate from point B to point C"
[10:25:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I was like, "Yeah, man, you got it."
[10:26:14] <adiabatic> you can't do that from an iPod+dumbphone unless you can get Internet at Point B
[10:26:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for GPS, what do I need it for? Do I travel? No.
[10:26:17] <feep[work]> adiabatic: amish and amish-ish
[10:26:40] <feep[work]> adiabatic: also, same here re notifications
[10:26:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> I only travel within NYC and upstate sometimes, for which I certainly do not need GPS
[10:27:10] <feep[work]> personally speaking, I occasionally leave my house
[10:27:13] <feep[work]> at this time, gps is useful
[10:27:15] <nshepperd2> just try the crack, man
[10:27:30] <adiabatic> sorry, for "from point B to point C", I failed to mention "I have never been to points B or C before"
[10:27:35] <feep[work]> also phone calls with parents~
[10:27:51] <quanticle> saturn2: This is like that anecdote from the Unix Hater's Handbook where the dude moves from a Lisp Machine to a Sun Workstation and his opinion on the Sun is, "Well, it's a good thing it boots fast, because I sure seem to need to reboot a lot"
[10:28:03] <adiabatic> this happens once every 2–5 years, but it did crimp my pre-gimped social life somewhat
[10:28:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, they're bad because: addictive, locked-down walled gardens, absolute shit UX, the mobile touch platform is inherently crippled and also application design for them is hampered by ... actually that's a whole long rant but the situation is bad, sanctioned spyware, tracking, security, etc.
[10:28:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Really, the question is why I *would* want a smartphone
[10:28:56] <quanticle> The veins on Obormot\Arcturus' hands are *literally* a map of the NYC subway system
[10:29:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[10:29:07] <saturn2> quanticle: yep
[10:30:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, reading that Aella post:
[10:30:20] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: it's nice to have an ebook reader, music player, gps, and phone all in one
[10:30:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But I suspect it’s not true, and that Wikipedia (or the literature it’s based on) has some incentive to deny that race and penis size have any correlation at all, so I took some adderall." ... that is some true-blue rationalist shit right there
[10:30:58] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I agree with all reasons you think smartphones are bad.
[10:31:01] <saturn2> nothing forces you to install the apps that are addictive
[10:31:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: ebook reader: pass, screen too small, lame, fuck that; music player: valid point but I don't listen to music *while doing other things* so it's not super relevant to me; gps: irrelevant to my interests; phone: I already have a phone
[10:31:35] <feep[work]> I still love my phone.
[10:31:46] <saturn2> sure

[10:32:20] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: I'd say "Omni apps on your phone", but most of my Omni app use is on my iPad in the kitchen, or maybe OmniFocus on my phone in the grocery store. I also keep lots of notes in Ulysses and also VoodooPad, and frequently it's useful for me to be able to use these things outside of the house
[10:32:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically there are zero even remotely good reasons for me to have a smartphone and many excellent reasons not to
[10:32:33] <nshepperd2> having a camera in my pocket makes it a little easier to take pictures of my cat
[10:32:40] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: your take is valid~
[10:32:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> The decision is just massively overdetermined
[10:32:49] <feep[work]> though, don't underestimate the ability to google on the go
[10:32:55] <adiabatic> Oh!
[10:33:05] <feep[work]> dictionaries as well
[10:33:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I certainly don't underestimate that ability and it's precisely one of the reasons I don't want a smartphone.
[10:33:23] <feep[work]> it's sometimes useful during phone calls
[10:33:28] <feep[work]> if your conversation partner cannot google themselves
[10:33:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't talk to people on the phone.
[10:33:35] <adiabatic> one great thing about having a smartphone is that you can see a weird piece of meat for sale at the store and look at whatever Serious Eats recipe is available for it *right then and there*
[10:33:36] * feep[work] blinks
[10:33:40] <feep[work]> okay..
[10:34:01] <feep[work]> anyway, again, your view is totally valid.
[10:34:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Yes, you see, that's precisely the sort of dynamic I want to carefully avoid.
[10:34:23] <quanticle> Anyway, I rebooted and I have bluetooth again
[10:34:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Tenuous grats
[10:34:35] <quanticle> Thank you Linux for approaching the stability of Windows XP
[10:34:36] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: …you…do? This is _not_ a central example of reasons why people avoid phones. Please tell me more about why having Serious Eats in your pocket is a bad thing
[10:34:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Because Socrates was right about smartphones
[10:34:57] <feep[work]> quanticle: yeah linux bluetooth is the shitshow du jour
[10:35:03] <feep[work]> at least wireless works now~
[10:35:04] <adiabatic> what did socrates have to say about smartphones
[10:35:09] <quanticle> du jour?
[10:35:18] <feep[work]> of the year
[10:35:18] <quanticle> When has bluetooth not been a shitshow on Linux?
[10:35:23] <adiabatic> what's 'year' in French?
[10:35:30] <quanticle> Yeah, yeah, I know what du jour means
[10:35:35] <feep[work]> OH, of the day*
[10:35:39] <feep[work]> sorry, misremembered times
[10:35:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: You know... "kids these days ain't got brains for crap, words on paper and out of mind", etc.
[10:35:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Except, you know... applied to smartphones
[10:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Develop exobrain, atrophy endobrain
[10:36:13] <adiabatic> feep[work]: yeah, they're only your next-door neighbors, who cares what words they use :P
[10:36:19] <feep[work]> quanticle: no the point is, there's always some new tech that doesn't work worth a crap on linux
[10:36:30] <feep[work]> it's bluetooth now, it used to be wireless
[10:36:34] <feep[work]> probably gonna be lte tomorrow
[10:36:43] <saturn2> quanticle: "When has bluetooth not been a shitshow on Linux?" oh that's easy, when it wasn't supported at all
[10:37:24] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: if it were something I'd forgotten, I could see your point…er…better. I'm still learning this shit and don't want to rebuild my Anki deck on cuts of meat names and how to cook them best
[10:37:34] <adiabatic> although quite honestly I should do that
[10:38:24] <quanticle> saturn2: Touché
[10:38:48] <quanticle> adiabatic, feep[work]: Okay, now that I have a working compose key how do I emoji with compose

[10:39:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The artist Vsevolod Ivanov presents us the Ancient Rus’ as he imagined it. He is deeply convinced that the history of ancient Russia is distorted or fabricated. Ivanov collects old tales and legends and creates his own vision of ancestors daily life.
[10:39:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> His speculative artwork consists of the series of paintings named “Vedic Rus'” where he exhibits the true reality of Russia’s past. According to Vsevolod Ivanov, alien ships, domesticated mammoths, dragons, Atlantis inspired architecture and mythical characters were part of the ancient Russian civilization."

[10:40:20] <feep[work]> Vedic Rus kickstarter when

[10:41:21] <feep[work]> ★
[10:41:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Better
[10:41:27] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: yes. just because it's in MacRoman doesn't make it Not Unicode
[10:41:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: By that logic, it's been Unicode the whole damn time!
[10:41:39] <quanticle> … like this?

[10:43:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "According to the legends Knyaz Rus’ had a “heavenly ship” at his disposal, which was used for “floating” in the sky. Here Ivanov vaguely discusses the possibility of connection of the Ancient aliens and Russian ancestors." ... well, that's hardly new. There's even an old Soviet cartoon about the flying ship
[10:43:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's probably based on the legend of the Skidbladnir
[10:43:50] <quanticle> And talk about walks on the Bahnofstaße

[10:44:42] <quanticle> Yes
[10:44:43] <adiabatic> quanticle: what about °
[10:44:51] <quanticle> What did you type to get that?
[10:44:51] <adiabatic> not to be confused with º
[10:44:56] <quanticle> Which compose shortcut
[10:45:01] <feep[work]> °
[10:45:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> °
[10:45:04] <adiabatic> ° is ⌥⇧8
[10:45:11] <feep[work]> quanticle: meta o o
[10:45:23] <quanticle> Oh °
[10:45:32] <adiabatic> the masculine ordinal thing is º (as in Nº)

[10:46:13] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: did they fix the thing for macos after reading your comment?
[10:46:21] <feep[work]> hm, those all actually seem to make the same letter. odd.
[10:46:37] <feep[work]> why does my keymap have three ways to type the same thing, you'd think it'd disambiguate
[10:46:44] <adiabatic> feep[work]: degree, then masculine: °º
[10:46:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Yes!
[10:46:58] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: :tada:
[10:47:09] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: do you read Slack emoji names
[10:47:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> I read them, yes
[10:47:34] <adiabatic> ok, good. I figure that's better than MacRoman mojibake
[10:47:53] <feep[work]> º
[10:48:09] <feep[work]> wow, that's a complicated xcompose sequence
[10:48:12] <feep[work]> meta ^ _ o
[10:48:21] <feep[work]> also ª
[10:49:04] <feep[work]> I think the idea is that you use it to write Nº 1 and the like
[10:49:19] <adiabatic> feep[work]: yes
[10:49:32] <feep[work]> so when do you use ª?
[10:49:50] <adiabatic> feep[work]: in Spanish, for "primera"
[10:49:55] <feep[work]> Ooh.
[10:50:15] <quanticle> feep: I just get an overbar: ¯ 
[10:50:15] <adiabatic> quanticle: what about ₂ and ² and ½ and ¼
[10:50:40] <adiabatic> also ₀ since that's been in the news for a year+
[10:50:46] <adiabatic> also what about a proper minus sign like −
[10:50:55] <quanticle> Man, I have no idea
[10:51:00] <feep[work]> quanticle: is your .XCompose set up to pull in /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US/Compose?
[10:51:01] <adiabatic> ≈ and ± are also handy too
[10:51:02] <quanticle> Look, I have learned enough today
[10:51:11] <quanticle> feep[work]: Probably not
[10:51:25] <feep[work]> quanticle: add this then include "/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"
[10:51:30] <feep[work]> then:*
[10:53:09] <feep[work]> https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/libX11/i18n/compose/en_US.UTF-8.html has a list

[10:53:50] <feep[work]> the sequence is "Multi_key asciicircum underscore o"
[10:54:14] <adiabatic> what about the combining circle, so you can press X⃝ to doubt
[10:54:23] <feep[work]> XD
[10:54:43] <feep[work]> it is a severe failure that unicode does not have A B X Y button glyphs
[10:54:52] <adiabatic> the painful thing is that Windows fonts by and large do NOT handle that correctly, and Windows people are WAY more likely to get the joke
[10:55:16] <adiabatic> feep[work]: those are easy, just do combining circles. Harder: LT, LB, ZL
[10:55:22] <adiabatic> (and their right-hand variants)
[10:55:34] <feep[work]> right, all the buttons should be in there
[10:55:52] <feep[work]> it's part of the domain language of gaming

[15:57:39] <dbohdan> Re: the discussion of Shinigami Eyes in the scrollback.  I have deliberately looked at hundreds of Twitter accounts with it.  From this I have learned to expect a person it tags green to be an SJW communist.  "Red = chill" was not true in my experience.  Some cool people SJWs would hate, like Aella, were tagged red.  However, when I explored Twitter's follower graph, I saw most red among religious fundamentalists, anti-LGBT politicians, and TERFs.
[15:58:19] <feep[work]> well yeah, it's a --- hang on, isn't that name super illegal?

[15:59:57] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: i have no idea why it uses pydiffvg, i assume bc the other code in that repo already did and so the author knew how to use it
[16:00:19] <dbohdan> feep[work]: It seems like it, doesn't it?
[16:00:24] <RiversHaveWings> You can just use an RGB tensor and nearest neighbor upscale it before feeding it to CLIP.
[16:00:34] <dbohdan> feep[work]: The page says, 'What's the origin of this extension's name?  In the Death Note manga/anime, "having the shinigami eyes" means being able to see people's names and remaining lifespan just by looking at them. In a similar way, this extension allows you to see a person's trans acceptance orientation just by looking at them.'
[16:06:12] <dbohdan> While I haven't reversed the Bloom filter, I suspect the median person tagged red is closer to https://twitter.com/DrawingEggen (to pick an example from my browser history) than to Aella

[17:15:54] <nshepperd> today i had an epiphany and realised how SVRG works. it's basically just stochastic gradient descent, that uses the gradient of a frozen set of parameters as a control variate
[17:16:05] <RiversHaveWings> huh
[17:18:32] <nshepperd> because the gradient on any given data point is highly correlated between the frozen parameters and your training parameters (if it hasn't been too many steps since they were frozen), you can subtract g_frozen(x) and add the average g_frozen(big minibatch) computed once, to reduce the variance of the gradient
[17:19:59] <feep[work]> > epiphany
[17:20:30] <feep[work]> <nshepperd> There's a hole in the value function like a great black pit, and the state of the network descends into it, and the gradient of the parameter set is guiding it--

[17:22:47] <nshepperd> heheh
[17:24:38] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd: doesn't svrg only really work for small training sets w/o data augmentation? at least i had that impression
[17:25:38] <nshepperd> yeah SVRG proper uses the full data gradient which is extremely costly to compute, even only occasionally
[17:26:18] <nshepperd> there's "streaming SVRG" which uses just a large minibatch
[17:27:21] <nshepperd> which could be usable on nn applications

[20:23:55] <ggreer> there's the pdf I downloaded, in case anyone cares
[20:24:08] <ggreer> the thing I was trying to find was the number of defensive gun use incidents in the US
[20:24:31] <ggreer> that paper says it's somewhere between 60,000 and 2.5 million per year
[20:24:37] <ggreer> so uhh.... really great information
[20:25:51] <ggreer> > The NCVS has estimated 60,000 to 120,000 defensive uses of guns per  year. On the basis of data from 1992 and 1994, the NCVS found 116,000 incidents (McDowall et al., 1998). Another body of research estimated  annual gun use for self-defense to be much higher, up to 2.5 million incidents, suggesting that self-defense can be an important crime deterrent (Kleck and Gertz, 1995).
[20:25:56] <ggreer> > Some studies on the association between self- defensive gun use and injury or loss to the victim have found less loss  and injury when a firearm is used (Kleck, 2001b).
[20:29:17] <vorpalhex> ggreer: the few times I've looked at it, I basically gave up on good sources here. A lot of DGUs don't get reported, get misreported, or there are never follow ups after initial reports.
[20:29:32] <ggreer> ok the 2.5m number is from a phone survey
[20:29:39] <ggreer> so.. lizardman constant and all that
[20:29:52] <vorpalhex> The best you might be able to do is find a county that does keep good court and police records, match them across cases, and do an analysis
[20:30:14] <ggreer> https://guncite.com/gcdgklec.html ok cute pun
[20:30:15] <Robomot> Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun (Gary Kleck's National Self-Defense Survey)
[20:30:21] <vorpalhex> but that won't account for non-reported cases, which might be a lot depending on your definition of DGU
[20:30:42] <vorpalhex> eg, "I pulled out my gun and the guy ran off, so I just continued on with my day"
[20:31:50] <ggreer> that seems very odd to me. I'd definitely call the cops if I had to pull a gun on someone
[20:33:22] <ggreer> out of 4,977 people surveyed, 222 said they'd used a gun defensively in the past 5 years. that's around 4% or: https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/
[20:33:22] <Robomot> Lizardman’s Constant Is 4% | Slate Star Codex (Beware of Phantom Lizardmen I have only done a little bit of social science research, but it was enough to make me hate people. One study I helped with analyzed whether people from different countr…)
[20:34:30] <vorpalhex> I'd call them too.. but even then you're likely going to be told "Was anyone shot? No? Ok, we're not gonna send anyone" and then no report is going to get made.. which means it won't show up in analysis.
[20:36:10] <gwern> (today's metadata weirdness: en-dashes in DOIs)
[20:36:57] <ggreer> other bits of the data support most of it being noise. apparently households that did report DGU averaged 1.5 DGUs in the 5 year period. also:
[20:36:59] <ggreer> > Eighty-five percent of the reports of DGUs we obtained involved the original R, the person with whom the interviewer first spoke. Given that most households contain more than one adult eligible to be interviewed, it was surprising that in a DGU-involved household the person who answered the phone would consistently turn out to be the individual who had been involved in the DGU.
[20:37:20] <ggreer> they rationalize that as "Our strong suspicion is that many Rs feel that it is not their place to tell total strangers that some other member of their household has used a gun for self-protection."
[20:37:42] <ggreer> my guess is that lots of people are making shit up on phone surveys
[20:39:42] <ggreer> unicode was a mistake
[20:44:42] <feepbot> <gwern> uploads https://www.gwern.net/docs/tea/2002-finsterer.pdf
[20:44:48] <mst> ggreer: I wonder to what extent likelihood of DGU correlates with likelihood of not trusting the police to do anything useful if you did contact them (though that's just a waffle, I agree with you that this data looks like a disaster)
[20:45:12] <ggreer> yeah I assume most defensive gun use is by convicted felons
[20:50:12] <kuudes> oh, btw, ggreer, could I have your opinion on which is better for random crime, pistol or rifle?
[20:50:19] <kuudes> I got into debate on the matter :D
[20:51:16] * gwern squints at the next metadata problem. ...what sort of date could an int of '2932012' be

[22:31:02] <rmmh> > Two members of the right-wing "Order of the Rising Sun" are arrested in Chicago with 30-40 kg of typhoid cultures with which they allegedly planned to poison the water supply in Chicago, St. Louis, and other cities. Experts say the plan is unlikely to cause health problems due to water chlorination.
[22:31:30] <gwern> where do you get a typhoid culture? your friendly local FBI agent?
[22:32:02] <rmmh> you ask mary
[22:33:25] <Betawolf> "Are you right-wing? Do you and your buddies have late-night fantasies of singlehandedly taking on the government? We can help! Talk to your local FBI handler."
[22:35:36] <gwern> 'American right-wingers have considered and sometimes planned theuse of biological weapons since at least 1972, when a white-supremacist groupcalled the Order of the Rising Sun apparently created as much as 40 kilograms oftyphoid bacteria cultures in a college laboratory. They planned to contaminatewater supplies in Chicago, St. Louis, and other midwestern cities, therebyleading to the deaths...
[22:35:42] <gwern> ...of "inferior" populations. The plot was uncovered when twomembers of the group panicked and informed police.' https://prospect.org/features/homegrown-horror/ hm. college lab?

[22:36:03] <gwern> all of these references are pretty vague and short. a little bit sus
[22:37:16] <gwern> (if you'd created entire drums of active typhoid cultures, you'd expect writers to not be using adverbs like 'apparently'. you'd also expect stuff like members getting sick - that's a *lot* of infectious bacteria floating around!)
[22:37:31] <rmmh> maybe they're using FBI weights and measures
[22:37:44] <rmmh> a big tub of 0.001% LSD? wow, they found 100kg of LSD!
[22:38:49] <gwern> (the chlorination part is also a bit of a red flag: they're competent enough biologists to acquire and culture 50kg of typhoid, but not enough to know 'all american water supplies are chlorinated specifically to kill typhoid and it's one of the greatest innovations in american public health history'?)

[22:43:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, these companies are doing this because of pressure from payment processors
[22:43:42] <rmmh> I think this might be fake news
[22:43:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> But... *why* is there pressure from payment processors??
[22:43:46] <rmmh> I can't find the original source

[22:45:20] <Betawolf> payment processors are slaves to some intersection of the USG and the Cathedral.
[22:45:47] <gwern> same reason payment processors have always had anti-porn and anti-graymarket pharmacy regs, and why they are seen as the chokepoint by activists
[22:45:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Who are the bootleggers in this scenario?

[22:47:04] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: operation chokepoint never ended
[22:47:21] <gwern> it's quite explicit, like nicolas christin's lab does work on online pharmacies and they write position papers for the pharmacorps who are angry about overseas pharmacies undercutting US prices with 'counterfeits' - 'payment processors are the chokepoint, fund some activist groups to make noise and list the specific payment processors providing loopholes, it's the cheapest way to shut them down'
[22:47:31] <gwern> this is also one way that brian krebs shills too
[22:49:03] <Betawolf> also look at what happens if the media hates you and you try to crowdfund for your legal defence.
[22:50:10] <gwern> there's definitely a lot of motte-and-bailey in that: to the public: "oh, mastercard and visa aren't *monopolies*!" in private: "naturally, of course, since they are monopolies, we need to pressure them by X, Y, and Z to get what we want..."
[22:50:38] <RiversHaveWings> so who is going to be the first to break from them and use crypto
[22:50:53] <rmmh> many crypto providers have the same sort of leverage

[23:11:08] <kuudes> over here in oulu, even though the council is right-center, the city indeed only zones land it owns
[23:11:22] <kuudes> it buys or force buys the land as forestland before zoningn
[23:12:23] <kuudes> and then sells it with additional contracts, such as that there must be at least x% of housing area to be sold at most y e/m2, or that you have to build and move into the house within 3 years or the sale gets rolled back etc
[23:12:30] <kuudes> which to me seem to work ok
[23:12:48] <kuudes> bottom floors are here much cheaper than in helsinki, top floors are pricier
[23:13:24] <kuudes> and we don't have that much of that thing that is complained about in helsinki, that people buy unbuilt land and sit on it while waiting for value rise
[23:13:35] <kuudes> while there is "not enough housing" or whatever
[23:14:11] <kuudes> mind you the landowners don't get completely screwed, they get paid relevant market price the land is valued at before zoning - they just don't get the value hike of zoning
[23:14:45] <kuudes> and city pays a premium for voluntary sales so that it does not have to use forced sales
[23:15:08] <kuudes> and well, we have a lots of land, most of it arable/woodland

[23:34:36] <RiversHaveWings> I would not be confident that you can't reconstruct training data from models
[23:34:50] <RiversHaveWings> You just may not be able to given current priors over images
[23:34:55] <adiabatic> rmmh: this is greasing the wheels for pervasive thoughtcrime monitoring, not PTM right now
[23:35:15] <RiversHaveWings> But priors get better over time
[23:35:16] <rmmh> RiversHaveWings: pigeonhole principle applied to the bit-size of the model

[23:42:47] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: a mobilenet is pretty small and dumb. it probably can't reconstruct much at all
[23:43:55] <gwern> you've seen stuff like open_nsfw
[23:44:32] <gwern> it's... not very good? I wouldn't be surprised if CLIP could create better CP than them merely by extrapolation and all the photos of children and young-looking nude adults, eg
[23:45:51] <RiversHaveWings> I've seen the results of direct optimization of an RGB image from open_nsfw
[23:46:39] <RiversHaveWings> But you can use better priors
[23:46:46] <RiversHaveWings> Like diffusion based feature visualization
[23:47:09] <gwern> you can use better priors all you like, but at some point the prior is doing all the work and just is CP
