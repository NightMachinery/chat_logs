[00:24:05] <rs_> How can I enable the built-in pager to show the output of external commands? This is something neovim does by default: vim -> https://i.imgur.com/Tu1uuL8.png vs neovim -> https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Q2TJ.png

[00:36:05] <talmobi> rs_: why not open a new buffer and read the external command output into it with :r!seq 100 ?
[00:36:08] <rs_> it looks like this http://ix.io/3pBO mimics the intended behavior for small outputs, but it reverts to its old ways when the output exceeds the height of the terminal
[00:36:52] <romainl> <C-z> for life
[00:38:54] <sylario> I'm impressed, when uninstalling vim, some apt hook has set vim-nox as the default vim
[00:39:15] <sylario> And my vimrc and plugins just works
[00:39:22] <rs_> talmobi: it is not so much the specific example with `seq`. I just thought the neovim defaults make for a nicer :make without "exiting" vim to show the output.

[07:11:09] <Intelo> and I think m1/2/3/4 so on just imply work for global marks. i wonder why not use them?
[07:14:26] <igemnace> Intelo: there are plugins that can display your buflist at the top. tabs make a lot of sense in the context they were intended for: if you have multiple arrangements of windows you want to switch between
[07:15:21] <igemnace> Intelo: you can cycle through buffers by mapping to :bnext and :bprev, but the fastest would definitely be switching by name. either with :b, or with a plugin that makes it easier to search (e.g. ctrl-p, fzf)
[07:16:12] <igemnace> Intelo: here's an example for a wrapper around :b to make it faster in some cases (particularly using globs): https://github.com/igemnace/vim-config/blob/master/cfg/plugin/quick-buffer.vim

[07:27:20] <Intelo> igemnace Is it possible to view tabs on top. and buffer list below those tabs. hit tab and go to next tab. C-tab  to go to next buffer that is in that tab.
[07:27:32] <Intelo> or some plugin already does this?
[07:28:24] <igemnace> i don't know of a plugin that does it. i don't know if it's possible for the tabline to span two lines, but in any case, :h tabline is what you want to look at
[07:28:24] <digmbot> :help tabline -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27tabline%27
[07:29:22] <igemnace> "hit tab and go to next tab", this part is simply mapping. <Tab> does something useful by default though. <C-Tab> is not recognizable as a different key from <Tab>
[07:33:02] <Intelo> Yes I did that part already
[07:33:55] <Intelo> I can view buffers in fzf or telescope but those list of buffers and then going to them is a little extra steps igemnace
[07:34:33] <Intelo> the `tab` key for tab simply works and it makes more sense as I see the tabs at top all the time. However this is not the case with buffers
[07:34:52] <Intelo> igemnace and ideas or plugins to achieve what I want or similar? 
[07:35:00] <nova> Intelo, read help for fzf. see CTRL-A specifically
[07:35:41] <igemnace> extra steps in what way? when you have a lot of buffers, it's much faster to do random access by addressing (O(1)) than by traversing the buflist (O(n))
[07:36:34] <nova> sorry Alt-A
[07:36:45] <Intelo> nova cannot find ctrl-a in fzf. btw, i switched to telescope
[07:36:54] <nova> I didn't like telescope
[07:37:01] <nova> can't help
[07:37:16] <igemnace> Intelo: one example: airline can be configured to display buffers at the top instead. then :nnoremap <Tab> :bnext<CR>
[07:38:31] <Intelo> igemnace extra step as in a) press some keys to view the buffer list,  b) hit tab or c-p/n to select buffer   c)  hit some keys choose to open as split or new tab     VS just hit tab to go to next buffer whose name is also viewable at top
[07:38:51] <Intelo> nova which part you didnt liked?
[07:38:57] <nova> what about using :b foo :sb foo and :vert sb foo
[07:39:07] <igemnace> Intelo: ok. you can have both. see the mapping i gave you, and extrapolate

[07:47:20] <rs_> Intelo: poor 07:b <TAB>... not many people use it :(
[07:47:27] <igemnace> it's possible to configure nnn to use an arbitrary program to do the opening. so you could have a script that opens images with ueberzug or w3m
[07:47:30] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)

[07:48:55] <igemnace> what i was talking about was to press l or enter in nnn, and it'd start ueberzug or w3m separately in the foreground to display the image
[07:49:38] <nova> hm

[07:51:22] <Intelo> igemnace I tried air-line. It displays buffers only if tags are not present. It does not show both nicely together. maybe first line at top can have tags and second line can have buffers
[07:51:23] <rs_> nova: do you have dmenu or rofi? Maybe that's better/faster than trying to get your terminal to load images

[07:52:20] <igemnace> Intelo: yes, i believe i said: i don't know of a plugin that does it. i don't know if it's possible for the tabline to span two lines, but in any case, :h tabline is what you want to look at

[07:54:57] <nova> eg: I press j or k or whatever in ranger and if it's an image, it is automatically rendered inside the terminal (even in tty, I believe) inside the ranger frame

[07:58:48] <Intelo> oh ..
[07:59:04] <igemnace> Intelo: buffers are internal representations of files. windows are viewports onto a buffer, with a corresponding section of the screen alloted for it. tabs are collections of windows

[22:47:15] <mattf> you know when you type :F and arrow up to auto complete Format? how can i do that auto complete on the command mode with C-k C-j ? if i don't type nothing C-k and C-j is already going up and down on  the history, but if i type something then it becomes ^K and ^J
[22:47:50] <romainl> "command-line" mode
[22:48:11] <mattf> is that the right name?
[22:48:15] <romainl> yes
[22:50:15] <mattf> oh i see the defaults are c-n and c-p
[22:50:19] <romainl> by default, <C-j> executes the command

[22:55:31] <mattf> that doesn't work
[22:55:39] <eyeris> Is it possible to define named colors (ala rgb.txt) from within vimscript?

[22:55:49] <vimgor> If you have to hit a key for it to happen it is _not_ auto.

[22:57:55] <romainl> well, you just showed your mappings
[22:58:02] <mattf> which didn't work
[22:58:58] <romainl> your <C-k> mapping works, here
[22:59:05] <mattf> oh weird
[22:59:15] <eyeris> romainl: I would like to run something like "hi alias name=BirchWood rgb=#d9cd94" and then use it with "hi Identifier guifg=BirchWood"
[22:59:46] <romainl> eyeris: you can already use those names
[23:00:15] <eyeris> romainl: I want to define new, non-standard names in my color scheme though.
[23:00:27] <romainl> eyeris: no can do
[23:00:51] <eyeris> darn
[23:00:52] <mattf> romainl: onh i just realised c-j is working but not c-k, it writes "^FD" to me
[23:00:53] <romainl> you will have to define variables and use execute

[23:01:53] <romainl> the arrows are much easier to press than <C-k> and <C-j>, just sayin'
[23:02:37] <mattf> hahaha no
