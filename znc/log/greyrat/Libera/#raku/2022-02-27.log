[15:50:45] <p6steve> looking at Inline::Python ... thought I might whet my appetite with fixing https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/issues/43
[15:51:25] <p6steve> good news is that this has necessitated getting the probes into the code and getting an idea how it works
[15:52:06] <p6steve> bad news is that I have got stuck trying to debug
[15:52:20] <p6steve> Digging in a bit, the p6_to_py.t error msg is on value Buf.new(228,98,99) throws 'This container does not reference a native unsigned integer'
[15:52:47] <p6steve> I naively expect that this error is thrown by the PyObject lib on CallObject and may have something to do with the UniCode representation of this object having changed between 2021.05 (works) and 2022.02 (fails)
[15:54:32] <p6steve> so wondering if Buf.new('äbc'.encode('latin-1')) may have changed between 2021.05 and 2022.02 - does anyhone know??
[15:55:16] <p6steve> this is python 3.9.7 on ubuntu

[16:28:43] <nine> It was trying to take int8 from a CArray and write those into a Buf (which is uint8 by default). Since 2022.02 Rakudo properly supports unsigned native ints which includes that it differs between them and signed native ints.
[16:52:56] <p6steve> thanks @nine ... so the error is when casting back over to raku and is a raku error ... (the test mentions something about a round trip, guess that didn't sink in) ... appreciate the steer - hopefully that will give me enough to work on
[17:10:29] <nine> Actually I've already pushed the fix :) It was just a single character similar to a lot of PRs that I submitted in the past month.

[19:24:17] <xinming> What is the right way to check %h is empty or not? %h.DEFINITE always returns true

[20:05:02] <guifa> xinming also, if you're doing it in a conditional, you can just put the hash in as such.  
[20:05:24] <guifa> if %hash { say "has items" } else { say "has no items" }

[22:10:07] <Xliff> \o
[22:10:18] * Xliff is recovering from a Hard Drive crash :(
[22:10:29] <Xliff> Lost like 6 months of workaaaa.
[22:11:10] <Xliff> And my keyboard. I am now using a more-expensive keyboard with soft-keys. I hate soft keys. It takes only the lightest touch to make you sound like an idiot.
[22:11:29] <Xliff> I tend to get repeat "s"es and "a"es by just tapping the thing.
[22:11:42] <Xliff> Hence the "workaaaa" above. 
[22:12:05] <Xliff> So.... what's the best way to convert a CStruct to a CArray[uint8]?

[22:58:09] <irced> pardon my intrusion but did anyone notice there is a nonworking link at https://examples.raku.org/index.html to the FAQs (footer area)?
[22:58:56] <irced> my god, you've all turned to stone!
[22:59:05] * irced attempts to cow-tip timo.
[22:59:41] * irced chisels a tattoo of a butterfly on ugexe.
[23:02:37] * irced puts a dainty feathered cap on vrurg.
[23:04:31] * irced moves lizmat to the top of the rubble (lizmat's fault clearly for the mess).
