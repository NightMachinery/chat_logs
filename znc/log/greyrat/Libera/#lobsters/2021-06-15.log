[01:18:17] <manicennui> There are like dozens of useful features that Twitter could implement, but they have basically added nothing useful for years.
[01:18:44] <Ticho> they added blue checkmarks to make vain people feel good, that's something :)
[01:18:50] <manicennui> About the only things they have done are adding more ads and preventing unofficial clients.
[01:18:54] <kirch> they changed the animation when you like a tweet.
[01:18:54] <bsandro> dw they roll out paid features now
[01:19:07] <manicennui> The paid features are pretty lame.
[01:21:01] <manicennui> Wouldn't the obvious feature have been to try to turn it into a payment platform like whatsapp?

[01:27:30] <manicennui> riv: Pretty common for CEO founders who make most of their money from shares.
[01:27:46] <manicennui> He is not even listed on the insider roster on Yahoo Finance though.
[01:27:52] <riv> > Elon Musk earns a paltry base salary of $37,000 for being the CEO of Tesla; Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg pays himself a symbolic $1 a year; so does Alphabet’s Larry Page.
[01:27:55] <manicennui> Just that he exercised a fuckton of stock.

[01:57:12] <manicennui> Dystopian corporate cesspool.
[01:57:13] <technomancy`> the thing is there's a good chance that the devs who work on it want to make it better but can't get the work to do that prioritized because the managers want new features
[01:57:22] <technomancy`> like how in slack you still can't /me in a thread
[01:57:50] <technomancy`> it could have been done years ago with competent management
[01:57:52] <manicennui> I feel like the reddit developers actively hate their users.
[01:58:31] <technomancy`> manicennui: I doubt the devs have much input on things like that
[01:58:50] <riv> i remember seeing a really good webcomic about UI guilt tripping you to subscribe to newsletter etc.
[01:58:52] <ngoldbaum> i remember when slack took away /me and it sounded like they never checked how often people use it
[01:59:14] <technomancy`> ngoldbaum: the new slash command thing is clearly designed by someone who has never used a CLI
[01:59:19] <manicennui> I don't use /me on slack because it looks weird and I doubt that my coworkers understand it.
[01:59:22] <technomancy`> there's no way you could blame that on the devs

[01:59:40] <ngoldbaum>  /giphy is like horribly broken
[01:59:49] <technomancy`> I guarantee there were many meetings of devs trying to explain to management why it's a bad idea, and being ignored
[02:00:21] <technomancy`> manicennui: that's just one example; all slash commands are broken in threads
[02:00:30] <Brekkjern> Why do people like giphy? I mean, it's a horribly bad service :S
[02:00:56] <Brekkjern> I get the want for the animations. The service is just shit

[05:03:31] <manicennui> Why not just shut the servers down?

[05:09:31] <timj> hard to imagine the comparatively HUGE success freenode could have had at this point if the new staff would have just idled. or cut their keyboard cords. or take a vacation. just *NOT* touch things. most people are lazy and wouldn't have moved... why do they *actively* drive people away like this?
[05:10:19] <ignaloidas> on the bright side, seems like freenode is now gonna have less users than libera

[05:12:09] <technomancy`> it honestly feels like rasengan is trying to win a bet he made with a friend about how quickly he could get to zero users
[05:12:35] <ignaloidas> I mean, just k-lining everyone would be a lot more efficient
[05:12:50] <technomancy`> presumably the bet precludes that
[05:13:03] <technomancy`> like he has to preserve plausible deniability
[05:13:06] <technomancy`> in this case barely-plausible
[05:13:14] <ignaloidas> didn't stop him k-lining people that bring in communities
[05:13:45] <technomancy`> well I don't see any better theories =)
[05:13:58] <manicennui> I guess I'm more baffled by the number of connections that remain on Freenode.
[05:14:24] <hoistbypetard> they're in the high 3 digits now
[05:14:39] <manicennui> I actually thought banning IRCCloud would do more damage.
[05:14:56] <hoistbypetard> it took them down about 45% overnight
[05:15:12] <ignaloidas> well, at least this hard reset purged idle connections and dead bouncers
[05:15:19] <hoistbypetard> yep
[05:15:23] <ignaloidas> also, why did they ban IRCCloud?
[05:15:41] <hoistbypetard> their spying bouncer doesn't like competition
[05:15:46] <jmiven> technomancy`: I was thinking of some kind of failed trolling, but I like your theory better
[05:16:01] <ignaloidas> they have bouncer now?...
[05:16:04] <hoistbypetard> yes

[05:18:36] <technomancy`> I thought this happened in the last hour
[05:18:44] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: my bouncer reconnects pretty automatically
[05:19:07] <technomancy`> yeah, it doesn't really mean actively connected
[05:19:13] <hoistbypetard> authentication would fail after this, but it'd be connected under an unregistered nick
[05:20:05] <ngoldbaum> apparently gmail is blocked for new registrations

[23:51:56] <imode> lol.
[23:52:20] <brennen> if you'd asked me a few years ago, i wouldn't have had "chan culture shitbags eat freenode" on my list of probable outcomes.
[23:52:33] <kiedtl> indeed
[23:52:33] <brennen> i guess i was insufficiently pessimistic for a lot of things.

[23:53:52] <companion_cube> sneaky
[23:54:18] <group> that's not fair on clowns, they're at least trying to be funny
[23:54:45] <ngoldbaum> yeah don’t be racist against clowns it’s not ok
[23:54:46] <demize> On the other hand, both the IRC Prince and clowns are often unintentionally tragic.
[23:55:00] *** group is now known as Unreal
[23:55:58] <Unreal> that's true, 2 very different kinds of tragic but tragic none the less

[23:59:02] <kiedtl> Yes, too many anti-freenode'ists there!
[23:59:04] <poww0wmus1c> I guess they also broke SASL, can't authenticate anymore.
[23:59:28] <kiedtl> yeah, SASL and nickserv are broken on the new network
