[07:46:00] <ThePendulum> bought the fancy flight stick... the sim community is just as addictive as the data boarder community D:
[07:46:22] <ThePendulum> and mech boards
[07:48:56] <thegrif> @ThePendulum : I have been fighting the itch of wanting to get into DCS World. I loved flight sims as a kid. Alas, I'm on a mac. But I did look into running a high-end GPU instance on Paperspace and then connecting to it over Parsec...just haven't pulled the trigger yet...
[07:49:00] <thegrif> what stick did you end up getting?
[07:50:51] <ThePendulum> VKB Gunfighter Mk. III gimbal with an SCG Kosmosima Premium grip
[07:51:00] <ThePendulum> https://flightsimcontrols.com/product/gunfighter-mk-iii/
[07:51:19] <ThePendulum> that base, but the grip it shows initially is the MCG Pro
[07:51:37] <ThePendulum> https://flightsimcontrols.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GF-3-Release-13-750.png
[07:52:17] <ThePendulum> contemplated between that and the Gladiator NXT, which costs about half as much https://flightsimcontrols.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SCG-R-P_1024-830x966.jpg 
[07:54:06] <ThePendulum> but although that one's fantastic too, a lot of people were talking about when they'll eventually upgrade to a Gunfighter or a Virpil WarBRD with an adjustable metal gimbal. figured since this thing could literally last me over 2 decades, I'll just go for that straight away
[07:55:48] <ThePendulum> I played F-16 Multirole Fighter as a kid, was always in the planes in GTA and Rigs of Rods, been playing lots of Extreme Landings and Real Flight Simulator on my phone, and more recently Flight Simulator 2020
[07:56:37] <ThePendulum> I didn't know about DCS until I started looking to get a stick for FS, I'll have to give that a try now, although indeed seeing some of the setups people have... not sure where you'd start as a noob
[07:58:27] <ThePendulum> hmm X-Plane runs on Mac
[07:59:05] <ThePendulum> indeed staggeringly few options. my daily driver is linux but I got windows on dual boot for games and sims
[07:59:57] <ThePendulum> unfortunately that does prevent me from gaming as often as I'd like, because I can't just quickly close a game and do some other things, I'll have to reboot back and forth 
[08:02:11] <ThePendulum> maybe I should dive into WSL a bit, although I guess then things might swing the other way and I game too often...

[09:11:12] <thegrif> @ThePendulum - yes, XPlane runs on mac. But it was the social aspect of DCS which got my attention. It is wild how serious these guys take it. Think WOW raid management but running huge air campaigns. Check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv7xoVbnyMA
[09:12:03] <thegrif> That's a squadron that did a full reenactment of Blackhawk Down. First fifteen minutes is briefing material. They had users controlling the humvees and everything.
[09:13:39] <thegrif> and another great video on the subject - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ApfDyeP7Zk. This guy does a phenomenal job with his military history videos. The stuff he did on the Gulf wars is also really good.

[10:14:55] <thegrif> You should hear the poor guy and how nervous he is. Scared he was going to get lost when taxiing, that he didn't set his IFF right so he wouldn't be recognized as a friendly, etc...
