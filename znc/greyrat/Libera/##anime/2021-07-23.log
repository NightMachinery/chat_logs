[00:01:34] <sentionics> Though, I haven't fooled with Java since like 2012 or something.

[01:46:48] <Nanobot> A bonus check I got last year almost cost me most of a year's salary this year. I think I managed to catch it in time.
[01:47:06] <Bco1981> tax?
[01:48:22] <Nanobot> I'm only exempt from making estimated tax payments this year if my withholdings are enough to cover my tax liability amount from last year. But, because I got a big bonus check last year, my withholdings wouldn't have been enough, which means I'd owe estimated taxes this year. I haven't been making those estimate tax payments, so I would owe late fees in the tens of thousands.
[01:49:17] <Nanobot> So, I just now ramped up my withholdings amounts. Hopefully that makes everything fine.

[07:26:02] <theholyduck> speed skating is more our jam
[07:26:04] <jessedesu_onaph> But it's a winter sport
[07:26:07] <theholyduck> or anything involving skis

[07:26:26] <theholyduck> MootPoot: lol
[07:26:30] <theholyduck> skating itself is pretty easy
[07:26:56] <theholyduck> jessedesu_onaph:  like originally the biathlon was developed as like an army training drill over here
[07:27:07] <theholyduck> combining long range skiing with precision shooting
[07:27:12] <jessedesu_onaph> Figure skating is the shit
[07:27:16] <MootPoot>  now they do it pussy style
[07:27:19] <MootPoot> only with 22lrs
[07:27:22] <jessedesu_onaph> Girls in short skirts
[07:27:29] <MootPoot> where is my 50 bmg biathalon
[07:27:41] <theholyduck> lot easier to design a safe range for .22lr
[07:27:44] <theholyduck> that you can ski around
[07:27:51] <MootPoot> If you have olympics
[07:27:52] <MootPoot> money
[07:28:07] <theholyduck> + the skill is in the marksmanship
[07:28:11] <theholyduck> not the size of the rifle you can handle
[07:28:14] <MootPoot> I know
[07:28:16] <theholyduck> but the ability to hit shots while winded
[07:28:17] <theholyduck> and standing up
[07:28:18] <MootPoot> but I wanna hear big boom
[07:28:33] <MootPoot> and to a degree..yes
[07:28:43] <MootPoot> having it in larger calibers would make it harder though
[07:28:51] <MootPoot> more weight, more recoil
[07:28:56] <jessedesu_onaph> I drink too much coffee, I'd be a terrible sniper
[07:28:56] <MootPoot> harder to keep shooting accurately
[07:29:02] <theholyduck> recoil only happens AFTER you pull the trigger though 
[07:29:04] <MootPoot> I want a sniper waifu
[07:29:20] <jessedesu_onaph> Sinon
[07:29:21] <theholyduck> it shouldnt significantly impact the accuracy of your shot if you arent flinching in anticipation of it
[07:29:22] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  the only way that works is if you're only shooting like 1-3 bullets
[07:29:43] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  i mean its a bolt action rifle.  you get a full reset between each shot
[07:29:46] <MootPoot> If I remember right they do like 20-30 at every stop
[07:29:51] <theholyduck> no they hit 5
[07:29:52] <theholyduck> :P
[07:30:00] <theholyduck> 5 targets. and they have to single load up to i think 3 times
[07:30:01] <theholyduck> if they miss
[07:30:06] <theholyduck> any targets STILL not down
[07:30:13] <theholyduck> they have to do penalty laps
[07:30:13] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  ehh... I know plenty of bolt actions that I cant shoot without wincing for more then 6-7 rounds
[07:30:25] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  insuficient training then :P 
[07:30:26] <MootPoot> and the additional rifle weight as well would make it harder 
[07:30:41] <MootPoot> those 22lrs they use are paperweights
[07:30:45] <MootPoot> I wish I had one
[07:30:50] <theholyduck> i mean they are pretty heavy rifles
[07:31:00] <theholyduck> helps keep them steady
[07:32:34] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  but I guess keeping the caliber low makes it easier for lighter weight and older people to compete
[07:32:40] <MootPoot> maybe have a centerfire and a rimfire class
[07:32:58] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i mean i have handled one or those biathlon rifles at a shooting range here. they are like 5 kilos
[07:33:33] <MootPoot> send me pls
[07:33:34] <theholyduck> according to google  the arctic warfare magnum is 6.5 kg
[07:33:52] <theholyduck> which is a bigboy .338 lapua rifle
[07:34:12] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  its not some like tiny all carbon fiber, plastic toy
[07:34:20] <MootPoot> I know they have weight to them
[07:34:25] <MootPoot> but that being said
[07:34:44] <MootPoot> 5kg on a 22lr is basically removing all realistic recoil
[07:35:07] * MootPoot just wants to see big boom
[07:35:33] * MootPoot also wants centerfire olympics to serve as an avenue for more countries not restricting target rifles to "only" 22lrs
[07:35:37] <MootPoot> hehe
[07:35:38] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i mean yeah it kicked like a bb gun 
[07:35:39] <theholyduck> :D
[07:35:45] <theholyduck> but you are still lugging some weight around with you
[07:35:56] <MootPoot> make it more realistic
[07:36:03] <MootPoot> you have to kill a seal with your 22lr
[07:36:08] <MootPoot> club it over the head or shoot it
[07:36:14] <MootPoot> then carry it with you the entire time
[07:36:28] <MootPoot> make the seal wear a nazi flag
[07:36:41] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:36:55] <MootPoot> then in the end you have to make a fire as fast as you can with nothing but your rifle and its ammo

[07:59:41] <ButterNoodle> there are still a bunch in a box somewhere...
[07:59:43] <Roey> that's how i use dto live
[07:59:55] <ButterNoodle> I think in all the crap I took out of the mustang when I sold it
[08:00:12] <ButterNoodle> I upgraded to an ipod when I was commuting.
[08:00:13] <Roey> yeah--so listen, that big box of 300-400 CDs, there are services that take them for you and burn them to mp3s AND FLACs, and give you back a thumb drive.
[08:00:24] <Roey> that's what I did.
[08:00:41] <ButterNoodle> well all mine started out as mp3s in the first place :3
[08:00:43] <Roey> s/burn them/rip them
[08:00:46] <Roey> ah :)
[08:00:51] <Roey> yeah Ihad cds like that as well
[08:01:11] <ButterNoodle> I remember in the 90s I'd rip every new cd to 192 when I got it
[08:01:16] <ButterNoodle> and put em up
[08:02:36] <ButterNoodle> yea now I couldnt think about getting an old mustang and running it stock.. the new ones literally have 2x the power or more

[08:36:12] <amigojapan> Not well ButterNoodle ,seems my son went out somewhere and nobody knows where he went and he blocked calls
[08:36:20] <amigojapan> Heya Jesse
[08:37:01] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they are talking about calling the police
[08:37:46] <ButterNoodle> :|
[08:37:54] <ButterNoodle> isnt he 18 soon
[08:38:04] <amigojapan> Yup
[08:38:42] <amigojapan> And soon Japanese adult age is changing to 18
[08:38:49] <ButterNoodle> ic
[08:38:58] <ButterNoodle> he probably got mad and is walking it off
[08:41:09] <Omega037> morning yall
[08:41:42] <Omega037> So I knocked something off my fridge and it hit the electric range and shattered it
[08:42:14] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I am worried he won't follow thru with going to school as planned and that was going to include a place to stay.
[08:42:16] <Omega037> I'm actually going to attempt to repair it, despite the fact that getting a new cooktop is like 50% the cost of a new unit
[08:42:19] <mixfix41`> thiose induction type stoves
[08:42:42] <amigojapan> Hi Omega037 
[08:42:45] <Omega037> The range came with the house when we bought it 7 years ago, so we got our moneys' worth I suppose
[08:42:59] <Omega037> I figure worst case, I learn a $400 lesson about oven repair
[08:43:03] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: he's smart enough to know that that stuff costs money, and having a place to stay and education is better than being homeless...
[08:43:26] <ButterNoodle> yuck Omega037
[08:43:30] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: no, he is not smart at all
[08:43:52] <ButterNoodle> well... sometimes it takes time
[08:44:12] <Omega037> Is there a sense of why he is doing this?
[08:44:23] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: he had already missed an exam he had to take
[08:44:26] <Omega037> My worry as a parent would be a manic or depressive episode
[08:44:41] <mixfix41`> could it be bullying
[08:44:44] <amigojapan> Omega037: rebellion?
[08:44:57] <Omega037> If it is rebellion, that is fine
[08:45:12] <Omega037> That tends to just lead to good life lessons
[08:45:21] <amigojapan> Ok
[08:45:40] <Omega037> So long as drugs aren't involved, which is somewhat less the case in Japan
[08:45:59] <Omega037> Well, actually I am not sure
[08:46:13] <Omega037> I had a friend in Japan tell me it was super easy to get great coke there
[08:46:19] <Omega037> But weed is hard
[08:46:20] <amigojapan> I really can't know

[08:48:43] <Omega037> Did he seem lucid during the call?
[08:48:49] <amigojapan> Omega037: he keeps on telling her to die

[08:49:41] <amigojapan> Just her that I know about
[08:52:14] <amigojapan> The care center said they are considering calling the police
[08:52:38] <amigojapan> He left about 6am
[08:52:41] <Omega037> They probably can't do that much
[08:52:49] <Omega037> But it might not hurt

[11:43:54] <amigojapan> I see Urchin[emacs] 
[11:44:44] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  I just reformatted a 500gb external ssd and bought a 5TB portable HDD for my mac
[11:44:57] <MootPoot> sadly mac does not natively write to NTFS
[11:45:04] <MootPoot> so I had to swap to exFAT
[11:45:28] <MootPoot> I need a file system that is journaled and works between both
[11:45:32] <MootPoot> exFAT tends to uh
[11:45:35] <MootPoot> corrupt itself
[11:46:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot I see
[11:46:33] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  I got the base model so it only has 256gb of storage onboard
[11:46:45] <MootPoot>  just my devtools is about 50gb worth
[11:47:36] <MootPoot> so apparently apple uses something called AFPS
[11:47:39] <MootPoot> APFS
[11:48:26] <MootPoot> its mostly the applications not compiled for ARM which are big
[11:48:28] <MootPoot> I dont know why
[11:48:43] <MootPoot> if I manage to get a ARM native app then its like 50-500mb
[11:48:54] <MootPoot> but if its a x86 one its multiple GB easy
[11:49:04] <mathu> you might have cause and effect reversed there
[11:49:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot cause arm is new
[11:49:33] <mathu> larger projects are likely to have more incompatibilities in their dep graph
[11:50:29] <MootPoot> lol, somehow online the price of a 3tb,4tb and 5tb portable hdd is basically the same
[11:50:40] <MootPoot> 110-120 dollars
[11:51:08] <MootPoot> mathu:  so you're saying that since the arm based apps are small and new, thats why they're smaller in size
[11:51:19] <MootPoot> they havent had years to accumulate excess
[11:51:40] <mathu> MootPoot: maybe not new, but smaller apps are easier to bring to a new architecture
[11:52:59] <MootPoot> I thought as long as you had the code in a high enough level ( human readable language ) you can just bip bop compile to any machine arch you want
[11:53:12] <MootPoot> any level above machine code
[11:53:41] <amigojapan> MootPoot no you did not listen to my answer the other day
[11:53:49] <mathu> there's lots and lots of non-portable C and C++, and also there can be bugs in other platforms' standard libraries that you have to debug and work around
[11:53:56] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  what did you say? I dont remember
[11:54:05] <MootPoot> these days I hop on and off really frequently
[11:54:13] <amigojapan> MootPoot not all code is portable just by recompiling
[11:54:17] <MootPoot> oh yeah

[11:58:53] <MootPoot> huh
[11:58:54] <MootPoot> TIL
[11:59:13] <mathu> there's also the infrastructure cost of adding support for M1 builds to all your build servers, CI, etc. either you need a fleet of M1 macs or you need to set up cross-compilation which is complex
[12:01:35] <mathu> that one is more relevant than the OS portability stuff i was saying earlier haha

[18:59:29] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, fair enough tho. I guess I could sell her feet pics to beaky instead
[18:59:30] <Cryowolf> good
[18:59:31] <ButterNoodle> Sadale's imouto is legal
[18:59:36] <Sadale> Cryowolf, for the context tho my imouto's an adult.
[18:59:55] <ButterNoodle> Sadale yes, just feet pics will always be of value
[19:00:10] <Sadale> damn this NEET beaky's gonna be rich as fuck not having to work
[19:00:13] <Sadale> I'm jealous
[19:00:22] <ButterNoodle> *because they could be anyone's feet - even when u say is ur imouto's
[19:00:30] <Sadale> oh true
[19:00:40] <DunceCotus> teen is ephebophile
[19:00:42] <Sadale> I could take feet pic of mine instead and falsely claim that it's my imouto's
[19:00:44] <Cryowolf> whats this about beaky?
[19:00:47] <ButterNoodle> pay 5$ for some random persons feet pics.. sell as imouto's for 20$
[19:01:00] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf its about feet
[19:01:01] <Cryowolf> Ephebophile includes 18-19 year olds
[19:01:08] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, woah. hustler!
[19:01:08] <ButterNoodle> !findquote beaky feet
[19:01:09] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: (46 / 461) < b​eaky> and i like mio's feet (9 more)
[19:01:14] <ButterNoodle> !more
[19:01:14] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: (94 / 461) <b​eaky> SaganMan yes she has nice bare feet (8 more)
[19:01:21] <Cryowolf> but I stick to legal
[19:01:41] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf: how.. they are adults in most of the modern world by law, and medically as well
[19:01:48] <DunceCotus> broaden your horizons
[19:01:49] <Sxem> itd be funny to show on film how feet fetishists cant even tell the difference between male and female feet
[19:01:51] <Jigsy> Legal is overrated.
[19:01:59] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, who?
[19:02:01] * ButterNoodle fact checks on teensteam.com
[19:03:38] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf: 18-19 year olds thats who
[19:03:45] <Cryowolf> yes
[19:05:06] <Cryowolf> Even if a 16 year old can look at 18-19, mentally they're quite immature and not ready for that aspect to be shared with an adult. This is a time for people around their own age to get to learn and understand, not be grossly manipulated by an adult that's taking advantage of their naivety etc
[19:05:38] <Cryowolf> this goes for both genders btw
[19:05:49] <ButterNoodle> btw ephebophilia is a word pedos use to try to separate themselves from baby fuckers... its not a word used in the DSM, and I dont think it ever was
[19:06:36] <ButterNoodle> its all pedophilia as per the diagnosis iirc
[19:06:49] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf I think its not your place to say what they are or are not ready for
[19:07:07] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle the DSM is a joke
[19:07:13] <ButterNoodle> is it?
[19:07:19] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, are you a pedophile?
[19:07:36] <DunceCotus> I have desires
[19:07:42] <DunceCotus> i am not one thing or another
[19:07:47] <ButterNoodle> seems to be the yardstick and the ruler for mental disease for the past 150 years
[19:08:03] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle I do not think its helped much
[19:08:13] <ButterNoodle> yea because we just label
[19:08:16] <ButterNoodle> never cure
[19:08:23] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle. you may be right that they aren't. Typically pedophilia is pre-pubescents though, I thtink.
[19:09:40] <Cryowolf> The closer to 18 you get, the more arbitrary it becomes. If someone is 17 years old with only 3 hours to midnight when they turn 18. That's extremely arbitrary

[19:10:08] <ButterNoodle> that is the generally accepted meaning.. but there are people in their 20's that are predators going after high school girls
[19:10:33] <ButterNoodle> <18 high school girls

[19:11:51] <ButterNoodle> yea its what we do.. as animals DunceCotus

[19:13:10] * ImoutoBot welcomes T​sundereNoises (102 / 258): <T​sundereNoises> old enough to come out of the test tube, old enough to breed
[19:13:18] <ButterNoodle> yea its a health and welfare problem to the predator.. someone underage girl's father is going to cut u up into pieces
[19:13:32] <DunceCotus> xD
[19:13:34] <ButterNoodle> I mean unless its an arranged marriage..
[19:14:54] <mixfix41> well if the guy is friendly that is interaction rt
[19:15:41] <DunceCotus>  friendly = predatorial
[19:15:46] <Cryowolf> if someone is 18+ imo that's now their deal and there are still laws protecting women (and sometimes but rarely men) from predators
[19:15:55] <mixfix41> its not its a fine line
[19:16:27] <DunceCotus> why draw the line at 18
[19:16:39] <mixfix41> i dont make the rules
[19:16:43] <DunceCotus> mixfix41 yeah you do
[19:16:49] <ButterNoodle> I mean... its kinda a curved line... an arc if u will
[19:16:53] <Cryowolf> I guess experts arrived at the most likely age of sexual maturity and mental maturity
[19:16:59] <mixfix41> my memory is jaded
[19:17:04] <Cryowolf> and applied it
[19:17:08] <ButterNoodle> bullets dont travel in a straight line...
[19:17:19] <DunceCotus> what is 'maturity'?
[19:17:46] <ButterNoodle> yea I have a 20 something kid that acts like a 15 year old..
[19:18:02] <DunceCotus> how does a 15 year old act?
[19:18:07] <ButterNoodle> so when the lines are blurred we just draw a line in the sand
[19:18:19] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: tries to fuck other 15 year olds
[19:18:39] <DunceCotus> you like who you like
[19:18:47] <DunceCotus> what matters is if the feelings are mutual, surely
[19:18:48] <TsundereNoises> it's funny that you think experts were involved in why laws are the way they are
[19:19:01] <ButterNoodle> ikrite
[19:19:02] <TsundereNoises> anyway, 18 year olds aren't mature, but you can't tell them that
[19:19:13] <DunceCotus> who is mature?
[19:19:17] <TsundereNoises> so that's where we, societally give up trying
[19:19:35] <TsundereNoises> maybe around 24?
[19:19:35] <Cryowolf> I can't blame someone for how they are born, like who they are attracted to. But I can blame them for what they do with this attraction
[19:19:43] <TsundereNoises> pulling a number out of nowhere, and obviously it's subjective and varies
[19:19:58] <Cryowolf> 25 is around the age when scientists have found out you reach full mental maturity
[19:20:10] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: just make shit up, advocate, and start a movement behind it
[19:20:12] <Cryowolf> as a "normal" person
[19:20:14] <ButterNoodle> without any logic
[19:20:46] <ButterNoodle> because feelings
[19:20:54] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: or better yet, make shit up that's profitable to my shareholders, and then spend lots of money on campaign contributions
[19:21:02] <ButterNoodle> yes
[19:21:10] <TsundereNoises> speaking of which, I'm not accepting donations from any secret megacorporations who want to invest in catgirl research...
[19:21:12] <ButterNoodle> the government is a cooperation
[19:21:26] <ButterNoodle> with a monopoly on everything
[19:21:45] <ButterNoodle> yes
[19:21:54] <ButterNoodle> did I tell you I stopped paying taxes?
[19:21:55] <Cryowolf> If someone feels attracted to underaged girls (or boys), while I feel it's disgusting. It's not until they abuse anyone underaged that I will judge them
[19:22:10] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf what if its not abuse?
[19:22:10] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: no, but nice Thoreau impression
[19:22:55] <ButterNoodle> I wrote a letter to the state dept of revenue, and the IRS, stating that until they dedicate funds to catgirl research - they are not utilizing my tax money appropriately, and I will no longer pay.
[19:23:23] <ButterNoodle> :)
[19:23:32] <TsundereNoises> !later tell Urchin[emacs] I love Gochiusa! Are you actually watching it or just sending me a funny screenshot?
[19:23:55] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: It's important to stand by your convictions
[19:24:01] <ButterNoodle> fax
[19:24:06] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, don't start on me. If you're an adult being sexual with a pre-pubescent or I'd say pubescent girl, that's  always abuse. Harder to judge post-pubescently but I would call a lot of those cases abuse too.
[19:24:28] <DunceCotus> why is it always abuse?
[19:25:23] <Cryowolf> you really sound like someone trying to justify or seek out approval for what you feel and make it real, unless you already have in which case I don't want to ever associate you with you again
[19:26:02] <ButterNoodle> although cute young -legal- girls are cute, I already raised 2 kids and dont need a 3rd... unless I am trying to make a 3rd w a cute girl :3
[19:26:06] <TsundereNoises> because uneven power dynamics lead to abuse often enough (maybe even a majority of the time) that, even though there CAN potentially be consensual situations, it's better to prohibit situations that look like abuse, since in those cases, the abused party often can't/won't come forward DUE TO the uneven power dynamic
[19:26:07] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf you know they initially thought homosexuality was always abuse too 
[19:26:13] <ButterNoodle> I think I have a hard stop around 24-25
[19:26:35] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: yes god turned the homosexuals into pillars of salt
[19:27:07] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, I knew that's where you were gonna go with this...What's next, call yourself MAP and call it pedosexual?
[19:27:10] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: the issue isn't who you have sex with, it's whether they have the realistic ability to say no, or to actually end things when they want to
[19:27:20] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises I think the reason is more because we do not discuss sexual matters with young people, and they do not feel they can discuss them with older people etc.
[19:27:21] <TsundereNoises> whether it's your uncle or your boss or your military commander, those are problems
[19:27:22] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: thats a good statement... reason why there is abuse from teachers, priests, police, etc
[19:27:52] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: exactly
[19:28:04] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: sex is everywhere, and yet sex is shame...
[19:28:07] <DunceCotus> if they are given the opportunity to say no then yes they have the ability
[19:28:08] <ButterNoodle> they know what they are doing
[19:28:24] <TsundereNoises> the problem is power abuse, large age differences are one form of that, it's not a problem once people are old enough they can tell the other party to fuck off and not face huge reprecussions
[19:28:30] *** Joins: hposca (~hposca@node-1w7jr9phoke2vrgk4227u1bpc.ipv6.telus.net)
[19:28:35] <ButterNoodle> pressure by an authoritarian figure will make u do crazy shit
[19:28:54] <DunceCotus> if the problem is power abuse, then maybe address the power aspect
[19:29:06] <ButterNoodle> lookup milgrams elecrtoctuion experiment
[19:29:24] <Jigsy> Does one pass or fail the Milgram experiment?
[19:29:35] <ButterNoodle> one just presses the button Jigsy
[19:29:41] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: as I said before, age limits ARE the only way to address one aspect of that, you can't take away the fact that a 50 year old priest has a lot of power over a 14 year old kid
[19:29:42] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle. or being essentially a child and having an adult tell you that you're a woman, that you're not like other girls etc etc
[19:29:43] <ButterNoodle> as we are only human
[19:29:46] <Jigsy> Yeah, but surely you either pass or fail.
[19:29:46] <DunceCotus> the problem seems to be less about sex and more about power/authority
[19:30:06] <ButterNoodle> it is DunceCotus
[19:30:14] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[19:30:26] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises age limits hurt more than they help
[19:30:34] <ButterNoodle> cause u can go to vietnam and bang underage.. they are just doing it for money
[19:30:38] <Cryowolf> children and young teens (heck even older teens to an extent) are stupid and easily manipulated.
[19:30:43] <Cryowolf> They're naive
[19:30:50] <Jigsy> ...
[19:30:53] <Jigsy> So are adults.
[19:30:54] <Jigsy> :P
[19:30:57] <TsundereNoises> the problem is 2 things: it's EXTREMELY hard for the weaker/younger party to actually come forward, or to say no, or to break things off
[19:31:13] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, because they're starving and desperately need money for their family
[19:31:26] <TsundereNoises> and 2) it's MUCH MUCH MUCH better to err on the side of a few people not getting to fuck who they want than everyone fucking who they want but some people having to fuck who they DON'T want
[19:31:35] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises then make it easier for them to do so
[19:31:40] <DunceCotus> won't happen if the taboo stays in place
[19:32:02] <Bco1981> i'm starving and desperately need someone to cook for me
[19:32:15] <Cryowolf> There's nothing that's going to make me accept someone being sexual with say a 15 year old, 12....11...10...8....6...5...4...2...0
[19:32:42] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: learn to cook, otherwise you'll never land a cute vtuber wife
[19:32:43] <Jigsy> 15.5 years old is okay, though, right?
[19:33:06] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: i'm just download her... another one for my collection
[19:33:37] <Cryowolf> Jigsy, no but I can agree it becomes a lot more complicated around there in emotional maturity and whenever you reach sexual maturity

[20:18:44] <TsundereNoises> I joked the other week that I should eventually become the expert on yuri reading levels, I decided I should take this as a serious goal
[20:18:57] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises maturity is just  a concept used to control people
[20:19:32] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: no, because I think plenty of people are immature who I have no influence whatsoever over. It's a useful concept to discuss things
[20:19:55] <DunceCotus> immature how?
[20:20:11] <TsundereNoises> all kinds of ways, it's a pretty damn broad concept
[20:21:00] <DunceCotus> and that's not necessarily a good thing
[20:21:36] <TsundereNoises> it's a concept, that's like saying ethics or education or laws are not a good thing
[20:21:49] <TsundereNoises> you CAN use any of those to control people, any of those CAN be bad, but also can be good and useful
[20:22:01] <TsundereNoises> and also are way too broad to simplify to some simple phrase
[20:24:04] <TsundereNoises> !picks
[20:24:05] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: Your current picks | Anime of the Week: Show by Rock: Mashumairesh!
[20:26:08] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises maturity is not a well defined concept
[20:26:22] <DunceCotus> and seems to more define what is lacking rather than what is present
[20:28:19] <TsundereNoises> !motw I Favor the Villainess
[20:28:20] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: You've set your pick to I Favor the Villainess. It will be automatically selected for Manga of the Week when your next turn comes.
[20:30:10] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: sure, I might agree that "not immature" is the better definition of maturity, and immature could then be defined as behaviors that are typical of youth and inexperience that most people regard as the wrong approach later in life
[20:30:11] <TsundereNoises> how's that
[20:30:22] <TsundereNoises> sometimes words are best defined by their opposites
[20:30:34] <TsundereNoises> like how would you define "unclear" other than just "not clear"
[20:30:41] <TsundereNoises> I think maybe mature and immature go in reverse
[20:35:15] <DunceCotus> problem is you need to get experience to be experienced/mature
[20:35:27] <TsundereNoises> yes
[20:35:40] <TsundereNoises> and there are plenty of mistakes people are prone to making when they don't know better
[20:35:56] <TsundereNoises> and frankly, behaviors which aren't even really mistakes, but are just needlessly obnoxious for no reason
[20:36:04] <TsundereNoises> which is why "immature" is a helpful word
[20:36:11] <TsundereNoises> at least when they're age-linked behaviors
[20:36:19] <DunceCotus> I do not think immature is helpful

[21:30:27] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin: I mean this season has Dragon Maid and Villainess
[21:30:40] <ButterNoodle> ik TsundereNoises.. she is cute
[21:30:56] <isekaijin> TsundereNoises: Thanks!
[21:30:59] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin: there are a lot of good cgdct anime in recent years, I've been really out of watching ANYTHING the past like 3 seasons, but before that I can be more helpful if you want
[21:31:24] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin: and CGDCT is my 2nd favorite genre, so I'm always happy to talk about it, and over the last 10 or so years I've probably actually seen a majority of them
[21:31:58] <TsundereNoises> if you want cute girls doing cute things, I'm always enthusiastic though
[21:32:24] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: does yuri count as a subset of cgdct actually?
[21:32:29] <TsundereNoises> with "other cute girls" as the thing?
[21:32:47] <ButterNoodle> hmmm... yes
[21:32:51] <isekaijin> Yuri need not always be CGDCT but is appreciated as well.
[21:33:26] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin is officially my new favorite new person
[21:35:14] <isekaijin> TsundereNoises: If you are a yuri and CGDCT connoisseur, I must rank you very highly as well.

[21:36:13] <Roey> isekaijin: hihi
[21:36:26] <Roey> yall talking lesbanime again?
[21:36:34] <isekaijin> Yes.
[21:36:37] <Roey> superb
[21:38:43] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin: well I was just saying earlier that it turns out Bloom into You is a surprisingly easy to read manga for japanese reading practice
[21:38:47] <TsundereNoises> I thought it would be much harder
[21:39:23] <isekaijin> What site do you use for reading manga raws?
[21:39:43] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin: the physical manga I have on my shelf
[21:39:51] <isekaijin> Whoaaa. Cool.
[21:39:56] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin: a lot good ones are uploaded with really shitty resolution if they are at all
[21:40:13] <isekaijin> Where do you buy it? amazon.jp?
[21:40:16] <TsundereNoises> there are some that are pretty decently scanned, but I can't remember what in particular because I've been mostly just buying them lately
[21:40:24] <TsundereNoises> also it feels like a good deed to support the artists
[21:40:37] <isekaijin> Indeed.
[21:40:39] <TsundereNoises> isekaijin: yeah, even things that are on amazon US can be weirdly priced sometimes
[21:40:55] <TsundereNoises> like amazon.co.jp even with shipping, is often cheaper than Amazon US for japanese shit
[21:41:00] <TsundereNoises> don't know why, it doesn't make much sense
[21:41:29] <TsundereNoises> it helps if you get a bunch of stuff at once, the shipping doesn't scale up linearly, so if you order like 10 things it's a better deal
[21:42:37] <Nanobot> God dammit. We go through this big tedious process to deliver the security keys to a client in a secure way, and the first thing they do after getting the keys is email us a screenshot with the key clearly displayed.
[21:42:42] <isekaijin> I cannot read manga without furigana, thoguh. I only understand those kanji that (a) happen to be written exactly the same in simplified Chinese, and (b) mean exactly the same thing in Chinese.
[21:42:54] <isekaijin> Nanobot: hahaha
[21:42:59] <Sxem> i still havent found a good place to pirate anime ever since verizon blocked nyaa
[21:45:17] <Bco1981> verizon?, didn't they just dns block in their own dns ?... use google dns.
[21:46:08] <ButterNoodle> ?

[21:57:16] <isekaijin> It remains to be seen whether they have blocked just the domain, or the IP(s?) it points to.
[21:57:18] <TsundereNoises> more likely that nyaa eventually changes their site
