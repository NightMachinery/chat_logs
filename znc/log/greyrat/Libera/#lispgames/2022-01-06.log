[10:19:21] <artchad> I'm back on Linux for development until I get OpenBSD compatible hardware. There is no point in crippling my development process just for the sake of using an OS I like more.
[10:19:58] <artchad> I'll probably use ab OpenBSD VM to check weather my code is portable though. If it runs on OpenBSD, it runs everywhere, basically. :D
[10:20:53] <artchad> btw. I just found this for learning bordeaux-threads: https://common-lisp-libraries.readthedocs.io/bordeaux-threads/ The API docs linked to from the CLIKI https://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/ are a lot less complete and useful compared to this guide.

[11:15:19] <artchad> mfiano: How would I fill a triangle in sdl2? There is #'render-fill-rect in the examples renderer.lisp, but there are no fill functions for other geometric shapes. Just curious. Maybe I'm supposed to create custom shapes through creating points and using #'fill-rect?
[11:16:41] <artchad> there is also nothing no function which contains the string "poly".

[12:48:06] <mfiano> artchad: I don't really render with SDL2. I just use it for an OpenGL window/context. My assumption is SDL2 is primarily for rendering image textures onto rects/surfaces, so custom shapes are images with transparency.

[12:57:46] <artchad> I think the same. I guess it's not that important
[12:58:24] <artchad> Are there examples of how to use sprite sheets? I mean how the sdl calls look that you need for defining a region and drawing it?
[13:01:30] <artchad> oh, nvm. I found https://github.com/TatriX/cl-sdl2-tutorial
[13:07:41] <artchad> My humble opinion would be to link to tutorial material within the cl-sdl2 repositories readme.

[15:35:32] <artchad> borodust: can it be that trivial-gamekit scales the window by a factor of 1.75?
[15:35:56] <artchad> I created a window with dimensions of 100x100, but the actual window is 175x175
[15:36:12] <artchad> I'm currently trying to port dmomd from trivial-gamkit to sdl2. :D
[15:39:32] <borodust> artchad: it scales according to hidpi scaling rules
[15:40:17] <borodust> if i remember correctly, it's just a (/ (framebuffer-size) (window-size)) or smth
[15:40:42] <artchad> oh. My I should've passed -dpi 100 to startx
[15:41:00] <artchad> I think it used 300dpi as the default after installing proprietary nvidia drivers
[15:41:20] <artchad> thanks for the answer
[15:41:23] <borodust> yes, it also checks what glfw returns for the ration
[15:41:24] <borodust> no probs

[18:41:43] <artchad> eventually
[18:42:03] <artchad> I've already made an "sdl2-port" branch.
[18:42:48] <artchad> the old repository had an issue, because mfiano renamed his dungen library.
[18:43:02] <artchad> either the system or package. I don't quite remember anymore.
[18:56:20] <borodust> artchad: understood, i don't think it would make too much sense linking to sdl2 dmomd from gamekit page, but i can drop that link if you say so
[19:11:59] <artchad> mfiano, "git clone https://github.com/mfiano/dungen.git" prompts for a username. Is that intended to be so? I would guess that's by accident.

[23:23:23] <simendsjo> Hi, are there any ECS implementations for CL? I find a couple of wip which haven't been updated in years like hasty and cl-ps-ecs.
[23:31:06] <artchad> simendsjo: Why do you want to use an ECS?
[23:32:38] <borodust> simendsjo: i think mfiano has several ECL-lite implementations 
[23:35:10] <simendsjo> I like the flexibility of adding and removing components to change behavior.
[23:36:38] <simendsjo> I tried to look at some projects from mfiano, but it looks like they're removed from github, and I cannot find an updated link. 404 from the homepage.
[23:36:56] <borodust> common lisp provides some flexibility out of the box with CLOS (and MOP if you need something slow and advanced)
[23:37:36] <borodust> simendsjo: one option would be to wait for mfiano reply 
[23:38:45] <borodust> i don't know any other ppl who attempted and completed any ECS impls
[23:38:46] <simendsjo> I don't know much CLOS - been year(s) since I "learned" CL. So there are probably better ways to design things in CL I just don't know.
[23:39:02] <mfiano> I do not have any ECS's, only EC, which is different. ECS is very data-oriented, and doesn't make much sense for a dynamic language like CL. Also my game engines with the EC technique are offline until they are finished (as mentioned, I cleaned up all my projects and now there is a single "common-lisp" mono-repo with some of my other stuff)
[23:39:26] <technomancy> what's EC stand for?
[23:39:33] <mfiano> Entity Component
[23:39:43] <technomancy> sounds ... really similar =)
[23:39:48] <mfiano> It is what old Unity does, for example, but DOTS
[23:40:03] <mfiano> err s/but/before/
[23:40:24] <technomancy> so it's the same as an entity component system, except it's not a system?
[23:40:40] <mfiano> https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq#how-is-ecs-different-from-entity-component-frameworks
[23:41:04] <technomancy> huh
[23:41:07] <borodust> yeah, they really went too smart with System element in the name ;p
[23:41:09] <technomancy> wonder why they named it so confusingly
[23:43:49] <simendsjo> I played around with Bevy over christmas, and really liked how easy it was to model and extend things as well as having great performance. Performance isn't really a big issue for me as I'm not exactly doing AAA development, but if querying grinds to a halt at 1000+ entities of 20+ components each, it might be too slow.
