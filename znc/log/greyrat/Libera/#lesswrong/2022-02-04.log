[00:11:03] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: funny story about multiprocessing and dataloaders
[00:11:38] <PapuaHardyNet> so I implemented a multiprocessing queue based dataloader THRICE, first with concurrency.futures, second with multiprocesssing.Queue and third with multiprocessing.SimpleQueue
[00:11:56] <PapuaHardyNet> all three eventually worked on my laptop, but none worked on the TPU device
[00:12:46] <PapuaHardyNet> as I laid in bed about an hour ago, I figured out the reason and just verified it: the multiple processes of the dataloader all try to access the TPU device, which causes the device to hang because the main process that tries to compute doesn't have access to the TPU device
[00:13:51] <PapuaHardyNet> now, I can't say for sure whether this is the actual cause of the hanging, but I did verify that multiple processes accessed the TPU device, and JAX does throw warnings if another python process is acessing the TPU device, and tells you that you cannot access the TPU if another process is using it
[00:14:37] <PapuaHardyNet> now I'm considering using an entirely separate python process that loads the data into memory, and perhaps IPC. Also considering Apache Arrow

[03:50:24] <gwern> he's generally just a lot more fearful and anxious, which isn't much of a psychopath trait
[03:51:55] <quanticle> So less psychopath and more rationalist. Got it.

[04:58:27] <quanticle> As I suspected
[04:59:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> The breathless LW coverage by Zvi was of course wildly premature, as more cynical^W jaded^W rational (???) people suspected to begin with

[05:00:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thus providing another example of that perennial rationalist problem that I like to think of as But Did You Actually Check Whether
[05:00:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The answer is "no". Always.)
[05:00:45] <quanticle> I mean, I say it a bit more poetically: before we ask ourselves why something is true, we must first determine whether it is true.
[05:02:06] <quanticle> So here's the real question: should I post this on LessWrong?
[05:02:16] <Betawolf> have you checked if it's true yet?
[05:02:18] <quanticle> Like, reply to the thread saying, "This was not ever the problem?"
[05:02:50] <quanticle> Betawolf: Well, I did a cursory check, like I stated above, and found that it wasn't and then basically ignored what people were saying on LessWrong.
[05:03:18] <quanticle> As Obormot\Arcturus pointed out, people on DSL did a more thorough examination, which confirmed my initial suspicions.
[05:03:43] <Betawolf> I meant the heuristic that we must check if things are true. 
[05:04:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Extensively :p
[05:04:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: yes you should
[05:07:04] <quanticle> Betawolf: My heuristic is that whenever I encounter someone telling me a pat just-so story for why something is true, the first thing I should do is do some research to see whether the phenomenon they're explaining actually is true. Early exposure to the works of Thomas Friedman taught me that lesson in a hard way.

[06:00:40] <quanticle> Because English is a trash language for trash people, that's why.

[10:01:28] <feep[work]> somewhere between that

In the event, the first large deployment of 60 satellites in May 2019 were 227 kg (500 lb)[ ‚Ä¶)
[10:02:35] <kuudes> I mean, a cell phone camera weights some grams
[10:02:38] <quanticle> It says that they have laser links and phased array radio antennas
[10:02:42] <kuudes> so that would cost dollars more
[10:03:17] <feep[work]> all I know is we've never seen video from a satellite on a webcast.
[10:04:50] <kuudes> that would be a different thing
[10:05:25] <feep[work]> ah google says the v9 had star trackers
[10:05:27] <feep[work]> wiki*
[10:05:30] <kuudes> I am thinking that if they have a fleet that travels 100 km on line of sight on all positions +-55 degrees latitude, they would be able to do things like photo russians in ukraine etc
[10:05:32] <quanticle> Yeah, I don't know, maybe they have a camera or something for diagnostics
[10:05:33] <feep[work]> might be they kept that
[10:05:53] <kuudes> or uyghur camps
[10:05:59] <feep[work]> kuudes: no because phone cam does not give you zoom etc, and that really does start cutting into mass budgets
[10:06:18] <feep[work]> also it doesn't get spacex any money
[10:06:25] <kuudes> yet
[10:06:35] <quanticle> Also, why do we need Starlink to do that where there are already like three or four companies with private satellite fleets already doing that

[10:07:17] <feep[work]> if the military pays them to include an optics unit, he'll put it on the next batch, but he won't do it preemptively.

[10:08:34] <feep[work]> oh, 100km height
[10:08:36] <feep[work]> depends on fov
[10:09:14] <feep[work]> that's the problem, it entirely comes down to optics
[10:09:40] <feep[work]> if it's just a phone cam, no magnification, then multiple square kilometers, ie. useless
[10:19:20] <kuudes> phone cam + 1 fixed lens?
[10:19:51] <feep[work]> I don't know anything about optics.

[11:54:25] <PapuaHardyNet> why is it important to put the jax stuff inside the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block though?
[11:55:10] <nshepperd2> i don't really know how pytorch dataloaders work with the shared memory stuff
[11:56:32] <nshepperd2> but my vague understanding is that with mp.set_start_method('spawn') method it spawns the data workers by making python load your main script as a (non-main) python module

[11:56:48] <nshepperd2> and then sends the dataset object to the worker with pickle
[11:57:08] <nshepperd2> or something along those lines
[11:57:22] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting. I'll try this
[11:57:32] <nshepperd2> so if you put the jax stuff inside  `if __name__ == "__main__"` it is only executed in the main process

[12:05:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I love being American:
[12:05:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> > If the cannon you want to buy was manufactured before 1898 (i.e., it‚Äôs a muzzle loading model), you can do so without regulation. If it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsaluting cannon,‚Äù it‚Äôs also exempt. And if it‚Äôs neither a ‚Äúsaluting cannon‚Äù nor a pre-1898 model, you need to pay a $200 tax stamp, fill in some forms, wait a bit, and . . . well, that‚Äôs it. Cannon are categorized as ‚Äúdestructive devices‚Äù under the 1934 National
[12:05:16] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Firearms Act, and they‚Äôre legal under federal law and in most states. You may have to jump through a few hoops to get one, but get one you assuredly can."
[12:05:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Thus, alternate fictional versions of America in which citizens can't purchase artillery guns are ... non-canon."
[12:08:48] <quanticle> America: the cannonical country
[12:10:31] <kuudes> when I visited the east border here, I noticed someone had a small cannon as a yard ornament. I presume it was nonfunctional, maybe
[12:10:43] <quanticle> What kind of cannon was it?
[12:10:53] <kuudes> a small, to my waist. frey
[12:10:55] <kuudes> *grey
[12:11:05] <quanticle> Yeah, but it was like an old-school pirate ship cannon?
[12:11:09] <quanticle> Or did it look modern?
[12:11:14] <kuudes> more pirate
[12:11:44] <quanticle> Could have been functional, actually! Those old cannons were decidedly low tech. Just a cast piece of bronze or iron with a hole drilled into it
[12:11:54] <kuudes> maybe indeed
[12:12:20] <kuudes> there were tank blockers at some points, but they are rather passive, just stones and iron girders
[12:12:25] <capisce> quanticle: so therapists are to society what HR are to the company
[12:12:30] <kuudes> yes
[12:12:40] <kuudes> but therapists can't fire you from society?
[12:12:45] <quanticle> They kinda can
[12:13:09] <quanticle> If they think that you're a threat to others or yourself they can have you institutionalized, I think
[12:13:35] <kuudes> ~
[12:13:59] <PapuaHardyNet> this is why you shouldn't date therapists
[12:14:29] <capisce> so that they'll go extinct?
[12:14:33] <capisce> unless they date each other
[12:14:43] <quanticle> capisce: I guess so? What is your interpretation of what HR does for a company?
[12:15:01] <quanticle> I need you to elaborate on this analogy before I can agree or disagree
[12:15:58] <capisce> they're there to protect the company, not work in your own best interest
[12:16:17] <kuudes> well there are different levels of people
[12:16:21] <capisce> and as you say therapists just try to reassure you
[12:16:35] <kuudes> usually over here therapists are psychologists, and those don't have the power to institutionalize you
[12:16:41] <kuudes> only psychiatrists have
[12:16:42] <capisce> ensuring you remain a productive member of society, I guess
[12:16:49] <kuudes> and over here it needs 3 different doctors
[12:17:27] <kuudes> 1st sends you overnight and withint 3 days another doctor needs to recommend to third doctor who needs to accept to hold you for longer. and you have right to complain to court iirc, same as with imprisonment
[12:17:37] <capisce> not a perfect analogy
[12:17:52] <quanticle> Right, I agree that the role of HR is to protect the company instead of protecting you, but I guess I don't see how that analogizes to how making people feel better about their delusions works to protect society.
[12:17:54] <capisce> since remaining a productive member of society is probably in most people's interest
[12:18:49] <quanticle> Well, I'm not sure that therapists actually do very much to help keep people as productive members of society.

[14:35:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am very excited about this post https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/iupkbiubpzDDGRpka/other-centered-ethics-and-harsanyi-s-aggregation-theorem
[14:35:51] <Robomot> Other-centered ethics and Harsanyi's Aggregation Theorem - Effective Altruism forum viewer (I'm interested in doing as much good as possible. This naturally raises the question of what counts as "good," and how (if at all) we can compare some "goods" to others. Is it better to help one person profoundly, or help a hundred people a little? To avert a death, or improve someone's quality of life? Is there any way ‚Ä¶)
[14:36:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've only read the intro
[14:36:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it seems like Holden is actually tackling the hard questions that underlie, like, all of EA, all of "rationalist" thinking about utilitarianism, etc.
[14:37:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Instead of just assuming them or giving haphazard and ad-hoc terrible arguments for them etc.
[14:38:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I expect I will radically disagree with all of his conclusions, but I am really glad someone decided to actually approach the subject seriously (if indeed he did, we'll see if the post lives up to its promise)
[14:40:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, I should say: I already disagree with his starting motivation for "other-centered ethics" in the first place; specifically, I think that the first bullet point he lists under "things to avoid" is actually fine or even good, and I think that "radical empathy" is actually a bad thing)
[14:42:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, specifically, the post promises a close look at Harsanyi's Aggregation Theorem, which I looked at a while ago and found entirely unconvincing as a justification for interpersonal utility aggregation - this is relevant because it's like the most common, or maybe even the only, even *supposedly* rigorous justification people *ever* cite for such aggregation)
[14:42:08] <feep[work]> I think I am most skeevy about the idea of expected utility as a property of the state of the universe
[14:42:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I... don't think that's an assumption anyone makes...?
[14:42:32] <feep[work]> I think you can salvage something like expected utility with a block universe, which gives you virtue ethics back
[14:42:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait, what do you mean by that, even
[14:42:39] <feep[work]> >In order to achieve a certain kind of consistency in our ethical decisions, we should use expected utility to model the sense in which some states of the world are better than others (both for individual people, and overall). 
[14:42:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Um
[14:43:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think you might be using "property of the state of the universe" weirdly? Or I'm misunderstanding?
[14:43:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or else I don't get what the problem with it is
[14:43:18] <feep[work]> for instance, if I violate all morality and commit lots of murders and betray like fifty oaths in order to achieve access to a time machine
[14:43:29] <feep[work]> that lets me go back in time and prevent myself from breaking those oaths and also save ten million people
[14:43:39] <feep[work]> this leads to a *state* of the universe that is unquestionably good
[14:43:49] <feep[work]> but if you look at the entire path, it has some problems in it
[14:44:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well
[14:44:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm just gonna channel shminux here and say that the solution to that is that the time travel scenario you describe is nonsense
[14:44:33] <feep[work]> and I think those problems matter *even if you only care about states.* as such, I don't think this morality is reflectively consistent.
[14:44:47] <feep[work]> eh, I think weaker forms of this happen all the time irl
[14:44:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're gonna have to justify that claim :p
[14:45:05] <feep[work]> like, the entirety of progressive morality?
[14:45:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... is based on time machines?
[14:45:16] <feep[work]> XD
[14:45:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway
[14:45:47] <feep[work]> no I mean, the fundamental thing that upsets me about certain kinds of outcome-focused morality is that it neglects both people's agency and their stated values
[14:45:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> To begin with your treatment is at least weird, if not actually confused
[14:46:00] <feep[work]> in the name of implementing an extrapolation of values you think they should ought to hold
[14:46:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Expected utility, obviously, is a property of actions
[14:46:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not of world states
[14:46:08] <feep[work]> I mean, see my quote :p
[14:46:13] * feep[work] blinks
[14:46:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I did
[14:46:15] <feep[work]> er, yes.
[14:46:40] <feep[work]> I don't even think it's a property of actions.
[14:46:48] <feep[work]> or rather, you can frame it that way, but it's reflectively inconsistent
[14:46:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> It of course is a property of actions
[14:46:53] <feep[work]> it's the sort of look that leads to two-boxing
[14:47:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, for "property", read something like "predicate"
[14:47:08] <feep[work]> imo, expected utility is a property of strategies.
[14:47:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh
[14:47:26] <feep[work]> which is not the same as actions!
[14:47:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do you really think the CDT vs. LDT question is relevant to this discussion
[14:47:38] <feep[work]> yes! :D
[14:47:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, does it actually make a difference
[14:47:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think it does
[14:47:55] <feep[work]> I think it's the basis of the unresolved conflict between utilitarianism and deontology.
[14:48:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no unresolved conflict! The resolution is rule consequentialism!
[14:48:19] <feep[work]> I think the problem is, only somewhat metaphorically, that people still don't understand why two boxing is bad.
[14:48:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, that's the resolution of the conflict between consequentialism and deontology, rather)
[14:48:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Specifically *utilitarianism* is just bad and wrong)
[14:48:36] <feep[work]> also rule consequentialism is *exactly* "expected utility is a property of strategies".
[14:48:52] <feep[work]> sorry, the unresolved social conflict
[14:49:03] <feep[work]> obv the mathematical conflict has been resolved to the satisfaction of everyone here.
[14:49:16] <feep[work]> :glares left and right, daring disagreement:
[14:49:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well no, rule consequentialism isn't necessarily "expected utility is" anything in particular because it doesn't require utility, but I take your point
[14:49:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also there is no mathematical conflict
[14:49:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because deontology doesn't involve math
[14:49:44] <feep[work]> ehhh
[14:49:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> It doesn't!
[14:49:52] <feep[work]> it can!
[14:49:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> It can't.
[14:50:12] <feep[work]> there's no rule saying a strategy can't involve a pocket calculator
[14:50:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's ... irrelevant, as I'm sure you know :p
[14:50:50] <feep[work]> the point is, any moral theory depends on classification.
[14:51:01] <feep[work]> which is inseparable from calculation.
[14:51:15] <feep[work]> I do take your point that I phrased it badly
[14:51:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "How do you resolve the conflict between 'don't lie' and 'help the needy'?" *woman looking at equations meme*
[14:51:28] <feep[work]> this but unironically
[14:51:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not deontology if there's an unironically-mathematical answer to that -_-
[14:51:57] <feep[work]> I mean, like, good luck getting an operational definition of "needy" without math

[14:52:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, all this *really* proves is that virtue ethics is a necessary implementation detail of deontology, just like it's a necessary implementation detail of everything else
[14:53:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> But beyond that, I don't know that the digression into deontology gets us anything

[15:31:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> The solution to the problem of interpersonal utility comparison

[15:33:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unbelievable
[15:33:35] <Gurkenglas> stereotypical strawman says: "bidets are gay". attempt to strengthen: "doing nonstandard things to your ass raises appeal to male mates more than to female mates". is that true? and what portion of the population doesn't like it when people they are not attracted to are attracted to them, in much the same way that they don't like the prospect of mating with them?

[16:12:50] <bildramer> what's the utility function of someone who prefers being utilitarian like that?
[16:13:03] <bildramer> is it the new weighted-sum one or his original?
[16:13:04] <nshepperd2> (one thing Holden doesn't mention is that under certain "‚ÄúObjective list‚Äù theories of well-being" you *can* define 'utility for person X' in a way that does have common units and can be compared in the obvious way. Like (to give a stupid example) if you just counted up the amount of dopamine or something)
[16:13:38] <Gurkenglas> bildramer, utilitarian like what?
[16:14:02] <bildramer> makes decisions based on what the theorems say
[16:15:20] <nshepperd2> (but if you want to weight certain peoples' utility higher or lower and make decisions based on that anyway, no bolt of lightning will stop you, so it's ultimately still a matter of values)
[16:15:28] <Gurkenglas> what your utility function is is distinct from what you'd prefer it was. the utility function would be as it was originally, and then he would, if possible, modify it as he wishes.
[16:16:01] <bildramer> say, you think state A has value 10, state B has value 5, everyone else thinks it's A: 10, B: 20, you act as if it's the second, but then what does it even mean that you think state A has more value?
[16:17:09] <Gurkenglas> it could mean that you'd pick A if there wasn't anyone else.
[16:20:37] <Gurkenglas> or, the lesser counterfactual, that you'd pick A if you didn't prefer to be utilitarian like that.
[16:22:14] <Gurkenglas> If you observe that everyone else thinks 10/20, make sure that you looked at what other people would do if *they* didn't prefer to be utilitarian like that, or you might just be keeping a spurious counterfactual in place :3
[16:22:38] <nshepperd2> bildramer: traditional hedonic utilitarians make decisions based on maximizing total expected pleasure over all people
[16:22:40] <feep[work]> you're a spurious counterfactual
[16:22:59] * feep[work] brandishes heroin syringe menacingly
[16:23:22] <Betawolf> https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-60256915 wow, the slave had an IQ of 59? Those conditions are terrible but it's sort of impressive they got productive work out of him.
[16:23:24] <Robomot> Carlisle modern slavery boss given suspended sentence - BBC News (Peter Swailes admitted the slavery charge after a disabled man was exploited for decades.)
[16:23:49] <nshepperd2> such people might call an individual's balance of pleasure "that person's utility"
[16:25:57] <nshepperd2> but it's only the total that qualifies as utility in the sense of a VNM-utility in accordance with which anyone makes decisions (in an imagined society of such hedonic utilitarians)
[16:26:58] <feep[work]> do people like that even still exist
[16:27:06] <Gurkenglas> Actually what feep said. Assuming away all the adaptations like caring-about-other-people in preprocessing might, uh, just leave you with nothing.
[16:27:32] <nshepperd2> naive preference utilitarianism in the sense of "just add up everyone's VNM-utility" is of course circular
[16:27:55] <feep[work]> wait, why?
[16:28:19] <nshepperd2> in that a roomful of such utilitarians could not be said to have any actual object level values
[16:28:34] <feep[work]> define values?
[16:28:47] <feep[work]> oic it's fully linear on the participants
[16:28:48] <nshepperd2> like, preferences for one thing over another?
[16:28:59] <Gurkenglas> <feep[work]> do people like that even still exist <- i assure you there exist various first-year philosophy students
[16:29:10] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I mean, how does that make it circular
[16:29:17] <feep[work]> it's a rather trivial morality, but it's still valid, no?
[16:29:28] <bildramer> honestly as time passes my opinions grow closer and closer to "optimization is cursed witch math, burn it at the stake"
[16:29:30] <feep[work]> the roomful of ..... oh I see what you mean
[16:29:39] <feep[work]> they don't want anything because they're just looking to everyone else to see what they want
[16:29:46] <nshepperd2> yes, exactly
[16:30:01] <feep[work]> I think most utility aggregation takes leave individual utility unspecified, not empty.
[16:30:06] <Obormot_\Gaia> nshepperd2: Sure, that's a "solution" but only in the sense of "turns out utilitarianism can't give us any answers unless we use something other than utilitarianism to generate our answers" - which, yes, is the only *actual* way out of the problem, but also undermines the entire motivation for atttemping to base your decisions on utilitarianism in the first place
[16:30:45] <bildramer> it feels like a copout - the world is chaotic, you should act strategically if you don't want to be defeated before you even notice, even three people voting to divide something isn't stable, etc.
[16:30:46] <nshepperd2> shrug
[16:30:52] <feep[work]> I see utilitarianism more as like
[16:30:53] <bildramer> but I don't see a way out
[16:30:55] <feep[work]> a lower bound
[16:30:59] <Obormot_\Gaia> nshepperd2: It's sort of like "utilitarianism, but imo I have a utility of infinity and everyone else, a utility of 0" and then you apply the usual aggregation procedures to that - can you do that? Is that coherent? Totally. Technically problematic in any way? Not even a little
[16:31:01] <feep[work]> "this is the least of how good your morality has to be"
[16:31:11] *** Obormot_\Gaia is now known as Obormot\Gaia
[16:31:23] <feep[work]> like, you do something simple like bounded utilitarianism on humans
[16:31:30] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: That's a very low bar though because utilitarianism leads to conclusions that are diametrically wrong and actively evil
[16:31:33] <feep[work]> and you will generally at least dodge genocide
[16:31:34] <nshepperd2> Obormot_\Gaia: utilitarians would argue that it at least constrains the answers you have to give and therefore provides some value
[16:31:43] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: Sort of like "your morality has to be at least as good as: murdering everyone"
[16:31:48] <feep[work]> I mean
[16:31:50] <feep[work]> antinatalism exists.
[16:31:52] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: Which is true, that is *a* lower bound, but... :p
[16:32:05] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Gaia: like, that coming up with a weight W_i for each person is less work than creating a morality ex nihilo
[16:32:11] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd2: Pretty weak argument imo
[16:32:18] <feep[work]> anyway, I like utilitarianism because it gives a good framework to think about societal implementations
[16:32:26] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd2: The weights are doing too much of the work for that to be convincing
[16:32:42] <feep[work]> like, traditional morality is just like
[16:32:48] <feep[work]> "what is good for a human to do"
[16:32:54] <feep[work]> I don't give a fuck! what's good for *humans* to do?
[16:33:08] <feep[work]> you can't solve this problem one by one
[16:33:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Sure you can
[16:33:19] <Obormot\Gaia> You not only can but have to
[16:33:19] <feep[work]> I mean, sure
[16:33:26] <feep[work]> eh. yes, but.
[16:33:26] <Obormot\Gaia> It's impossible to solve it in any other way
[16:33:26] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Gaia: i suppose that's possible, i don't really know how to evaluate how much of the work is too much

[16:33:45] <feep[work]> utilitarianism still requires an individual solution, but it doesn't block us from making progress on aggregation while we work out what we want
[16:34:00] <feep[work]> it kinda decouples the two problems.
[16:34:20] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd2: Sure, yeah. Obviously this is hardly my only problem with utilitarianism... I guess if it were flawless *otherwise* I might be slightly more inclined to take that sort of "at least it constrains ..." argument seriously
[16:34:37] <bildramer> consider the fact that preferences can be altered. how should you alter others' preferences?
[16:34:44] <feep[work]> however they prefer :D
[16:34:51] <Obormot\Gaia> bildramer: Charismatically
[16:35:19] <Gurkenglas> I have sometimes complained that the problem with aggregating utility functions by taking an expectation is that multiplying a utility function by 2 leaves it representing the same preferences, but changes the aggregate, so this aggregate is meaningless. people have replied "just normalize first" and i thought that's just turning off the alarm signal. but... doesn't updating on evidence also involve a 
[16:35:20] <Gurkenglas> normalization step?
[16:35:20] <bildramer> there are just so many problems. as a model for single decisions affecting many people when you know the consequences, it works, sometimes
[16:35:52] <Obormot\Gaia> Gurkenglas: Yes, that's my point: "normalization" is just a fancy word for "turn these meaningful numbers into meaningless numbers"
[16:36:02] <Obormot\Gaia> Once you normalize, the utility values stop meaning anything
[16:36:23] <feep[work]> I don't think that follows
[16:36:25] <Obormot\Gaia> People are extremely resistant to understanding this
[16:36:46] <feep[work]> they stop measuring an objective function, sure
[16:36:55] <Obormot\Gaia> And start instead measuring ... nothing
[16:36:56] <feep[work]> but I think when you allowed individual preference, that already went out the window.
[16:36:59] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Gaia: sure totally. if you look at the constraints and think "these seem bad and wrong" it doesn't look too useful
[16:37:27] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: N...no
[16:37:40] <feep[work]> yes? like, what exactly are you measuring there
[16:37:41] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: The utility values are just a representation of the preferences
[16:37:45] <feep[work]> neural input strength?
[16:37:47] <Obormot\Gaia> No
[16:37:53] <Obormot\Gaia> Literally just the preferences
[16:37:55] <feep[work]> preference is inherently relative
[16:38:01] <Obormot\Gaia> Dunno what you mean by that
[16:38:02] <feep[work]> it's a unitless number
[16:38:05] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes
[16:38:21] <Obormot\Gaia> I mean, go read up on the VNM theorem
[16:38:24] <feep[work]> or rather, inasmuch it's comparable at all it's comparable in the brain
[16:38:32] <nshepperd2> so actually normalization turns meaningless numbers into different meaningless numbers
[16:38:36] <feep[work]> like, I can do A or B
[16:38:39] <Obormot\Gaia> (Of course in practice people's actual preferences do not conform to the VNM axioms in the first place)
[16:38:45] <feep[work]> I do B, first-order this means just that pref(B) > pref(A)
[16:38:55] <Obormot\Gaia> (So they don't have a utility function and their preferences can't be represented by utilities at all ever)
[16:39:02] <feep[work]> well, that's obviously true
[16:39:04] <Obormot\Gaia> (So all of this is double-super-extra-moot)
[16:39:19] <Obormot\Gaia> Like, utilitarianism does not work on any level, this is the amazing thing
[16:39:20] <feep[work]> well, I mean, otoh, no
[16:39:26] <feep[work]> hang on, you're mixing two things up
[16:39:27] <Obormot\Gaia> It just straight up does not work at all, even a little
[16:39:31] <feep[work]> utilitarianism is a bad psychological theory.
[16:39:37] <Obormot\Gaia> No
[16:39:38] <feep[work]> that's not what anyone is proposing it for tho
[16:39:40] <Obormot\Gaia> You are mistaken
[16:39:42] <feep[work]> except maybe robin hanson
[16:39:54] <Obormot\Gaia> I am saying it's a bad moral theory because it literally *does not work*
[16:39:59] <feep[work]> er, no, which one was the economics blogger
[16:40:07] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: I mean, I have preferences sometimes.
[16:40:11] <Obormot\Gaia> Me too
[16:40:18] <feep[work]> right, and then I do one or the other
[16:40:19] <Obormot\Gaia> But do they conform to the VNM axioms? Nope
[16:40:22] <nshepperd2> i don't think you can really claim that people's actual preferences do not conform to the VNM axioms when people's preferences have never been adequately measured
[16:40:23] <feep[work]> and genera-- hm
[16:40:30] <feep[work]> I don't think they conform as little as you think
[16:40:41] <feep[work]> people are exploitable, but not limitlessly so
[16:40:44] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd2: Violations of the axioms have been uncontroversially and clearly observed
[16:40:46] <bildramer> feep[work]: keep in mind that you can do A even if pref(B) > pref(A), so no relying on revealed preferences
[16:40:54] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd2: And are even endorsed on reflection
[16:40:58] <feep[work]> bildramer: 'swhy I said first-order
[16:40:59] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd2: There's tons of papers about this
[16:41:12] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: I didn't say people are exploitable
[16:41:25] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: right, that's what I meant by "utilitarianism is a bad psychological theory"
[16:41:29] <bildramer> I'd phrase it as first order pref(B)>pref(A) means you do B, but not vice versa
[16:41:32] <feep[work]> and I'm not even convinced of it
[16:41:53] <feep[work]> I do think that my brain contains a preference ranking of outcomes.
[16:41:59] <feep[work]> I just think it doesn't directly drive decisions.
[16:41:59] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: In fact people are mostly *not* exploitable despite their preferences violating the VNM axioms left and right, which is an excellent counterargument to the argument (famously NOT ever made by vN or M, note!!) that the VNM axioms ought to be taken as axioms of "rationality"
[16:42:15] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: And no, it is you who are confused
[16:42:39] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: What you mean is "utility theory is a bad psychological theory", but utility theory is not utilitarianism, they are two totally different things

[16:42:54] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: right, thank you, fair nuf
[16:43:16] <Obormot\Gaia> But *because* utility theory is a bad psychological theory, that is (one of the reasons) why [preference] *utilitarianism* is a bad *moral* theory
[16:43:31] <Obormot\Gaia> (On account of being technically undecidable)
[16:43:35] <feep[work]> I'm not actually convinced that utility theory is wrong.
[16:43:43] <Obormot\Gaia> What do you mean "wrong"
[16:43:55] <feep[work]> I mean, obviously it's wrong in a trivial sense, there's counterexamples
[16:44:01] <Obormot\Gaia> wat
[16:44:05] <feep[work]> like, as you said
[16:44:18] <Obormot\Gaia> It follows from the axioms and thus is not "wrong" formally, but fails to describe humans and therefore is wrong descriptively
[16:44:33] <feep[work]> no, utility theory as a psychological theory
[16:44:37] <Obormot\Gaia> There's no room here to "think that it's not wrong" or to "not be convinced that it's wrong" etc.
[16:44:48] <feep[work]> I think it might not be wrong for humans in a certain sense
[16:44:55] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: Again, violations of the VNM axioms in humans are *extremely* well-documented.
[16:44:57] <feep[work]> lemme finish the sentence

[16:45:54] <feep[work]> I think it's possible, and introspectively plausible, that human decisionmaking can be modelled as either a system that contains a preference *component* that's largely vnm consistent, or a "dynamic preference" system that violates vnm because we don't understand how the inputs are constructed.
[16:45:55] <Obormot\Gaia> And they (the axiom violations) are both very resistant to any attempts to eliminate them via attempts to impose any sort of reflective-consistency, AND have *theoretical* justifications!
[16:46:26] <feep[work]> as such, I don't think we should be ready to throw out utility theory entirely.
[16:46:32] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: I think that what you said is insufficiently well-specified to even be falsifiable or meaningfully testable
[16:46:38] <feep[work]> that's fair.
[16:46:50] <feep[work]> I don't think it's falsifiable at the current levels of technology, anyway.
[16:47:15] <feep[work]> but given a complete description of human cognition (and the attendant skill), I could be convinced of its truth or falsity.
[16:47:28] <nshepperd2> I think said violations of the VNM axioms are actually violations of the assumption that the payoff matrix assumed by an experiment is the actual payoff matrix because the experimental context can't be disentangled from the strategic context of life the universe and everything
[16:47:34] <Obormot\Gaia> Well, when we have a complete description of human cognition, we can revisit this discussion :p
[16:47:35] <feep[work]> that's my take too.
[16:47:46] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: judgment under uncertainty thooo
[16:47:48] <bildramer> maybe we're subagents all the way down
[16:47:55] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd2: I agree that that's a lot of it but I don't think that's nearly all of it
[16:49:56] <nshepperd2> (which is perhaps an argument against *utilitarianism* as opposed to VNM-utility, bc it assumes that utility *can* be disentangled in some principled way)
[16:50:29] <nshepperd2> (maybe not tho idk)
[16:51:20] <bildramer> the "I swear one of these days I'll stop being lazy and sit down and think about meta-ethics" part of my mind is stuck on the "three people voting to divide a cake" example. there's always a proposal that increases 2 of the portions, so has the majority of votes, so naive agents keep going in loops
[16:51:43] <bildramer> maybe ethics has nothing to say about that sort of situation, but then what use is it?
[16:53:48] <feep[work]> huh? if you keep going in loops, wouldn't you adopt a cooperative proposal to "avoid loops"?
[16:54:48] <Obormot\Gaia> What if you didn't
[16:55:00] <feep[work]> then you'd go in loops and that would be an annoying outcome
[16:55:06] <feep[work]> and thus accrue disutility
[16:55:07] <Obormot\Gaia> Would you, though
[16:55:08] <bildramer> assuming cooperation is possible, cooperation solves problems, yes
[16:55:14] <Obormot\Gaia> What if instead you stopped being a naive agent
[16:55:28] <feep[work]> assuming cooperation is impossible, gl with metaethics :P
