[00:44:56] <mehwork> does it make sense to need to get/use a Vault and/or AWS SecretsManager _locally_ to get secrets, or should local dev just use environment variables?
[00:45:42] *** Quits: murii (~murii@2a02:a58:835a:1100:ecd5:eb37:2447:6d14) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:50:25] <rawtaz> depends on how sensitive they are i presume. i dont really expect that your production environment should ever use the same credentials as your dev, and vice-versa, so my opinion would in general be that you can use env vars for the *development* credentials.
[00:51:00] <rawtaz> but at the same time, your dev env should be as similar to the real env as possible in terms of how it works, so it would be better to use whatever credential management you use in prod in dev as well. but with its own db and not the real creds of course
[01:03:53] <mehwork> I could see that for Non-serverless/Vault, but with AWS SecetsManager from Lambda, it's serverless and i'm not sure i can set up a local secrets manager with the sls (serverless) framework
[01:10:25] <rawtaz> why not? dont you define which secrets manager you use or something?

[01:12:50] <mehwork> i think it requires docker to run it locally
[01:14:55] <mehwork> i guess it could make a real call out to the real secrets manager and all i'd have to do is tell it to access the 'local' section

[01:28:11] <rawtaz> i probably dont follow along well enough to be of use in this question, so nerver mind me :)
[01:31:07] <mehwork> it's alright, you usually give good advice and even bouncing ideas off of you is helping me think
[01:36:30] <rawtaz> thanks

[01:49:47] <rawtaz> what a relief
[01:57:11] <slaughter> mehwork is there a reason in particular you wouldn't want to make calls out to SecretsManager?
[02:14:54] <rawtaz> grr, dont you just hate it when you discuss something technical with someone, and theyre all "way X is the right way!" even though it simply isnt because it only applies to THEIR specific use case and theyre completely blind to any other use case and thereby that way X is not the right way for what the discussion is about :/
[02:14:59] <rawtaz> kind of anoying and time wasting
[02:15:27] <slaughter> Oh hey is that comment about me
[02:16:34] <rawtaz> not at all :)
[02:16:56] <rawtaz> about $others
[02:17:03] <slaughter> Well dang I'll have to be more persistent in the future
[02:17:18] <slaughter> But for real yeah that's pretty annoying, I've seen it far too many times
[02:17:31] <slaughter> And if they're a non-tech person their answer is always Google Sheets or Excel
[02:17:47] <rawtaz> yeah
[02:18:20] <rawtaz> the one im thinking of now only thinks in terms of mega-huge container running across several fleets of datacenters or something like that, and thats simply not a use case im talking about lol
[02:18:27] <rawtaz> oh well. thanks for agreeing
[02:18:49] <slaughter> Oh jesus that's uhhhhhhhhhhh quite the universal solution to decide on 
[02:19:05] <slaughter> That's like the anti-solution to most things
[02:19:17] <rawtaz> haha 
[02:22:33] <slaughter> Reminds me of trying to setup a ~30 line JS microservice to fetch weather information and having the enterprise networking and systems teams ask me why I didn't use docker with traefik and redis and where my WAF configuration and what was my HA plan
[02:23:36] <slaughter> It literally took me explaining to 10 seasoned professionals twice for them to understand how API Gateway + Lambda was even going to work and why a weather service hitting a public API didn't need WAF or HA
[02:24:39] <rawtaz> hah
[02:27:04] <slaughter> Oh yeah just found my notes on it. They did indeed come back to me initially with a diagram overviewing how they'd solve it instead - an ALB with WAF, a multi-AZ docker host situation (they didn't know how to use ECS so I think it was EC2), traefik, jaeger, and portainer. Complimented with a VPN configuration
[02:27:20] <slaughter> And this - specifically, this - is why I will not work in enterprise
[02:27:49] <rawtaz> wow. sounds advanced. i wish i knew how to do that :)
[02:28:02] <slaughter> Oh lol and traefik and jaeger were running on individual EC2s behind an nginx configuration
[02:28:49] <slaughter> When it came time for code review none of them could understand what a 30 line JS file was doing so they just greenlit it on trust

[21:04:05] <kwilczynski> Me?
[21:04:12] <rawtaz> yup
[21:04:14] <kwilczynski> I am stuck at the intro animation...
[21:04:18] <rawtaz> hahaha
[21:04:21] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:04:41] <kwilczynski> Got a flu.
[21:04:45] <rawtaz> oh no :(
[21:04:46] <kwilczynski> So feeling awful.
[21:04:56] <kwilczynski> Got worried it was COVID.
[21:05:04] <kwilczynski> But thankfully not.
[21:05:06] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:05:10] <rawtaz> is the omicron variant like 100% in your country too?
[21:05:15] <rawtaz> are you vaccinated?
[21:05:33] <kwilczynski> Yessir. x2
[21:05:54] <rawtaz> which vaccine are they using where you are? and have they started with a third dose yet?
[21:05:58] <kwilczynski> Yeah Omicron is ravaging here too.
[21:06:02] <kwilczynski> Pfizer
[21:06:18] <rawtaz> according to news here in sweden it's in all relevant aspects 100% omicron now, it's pushed out the other variants. i think thats great
[21:06:23] <kwilczynski> You can choose whichever you like.
[21:06:27] <rawtaz> right
[21:06:33] <rawtaz> sputnik here i come! \o/
[21:06:43] <Dus10> I have it...
[21:06:58] <rawtaz> you have covid?
[21:07:08] <Dus10> yeah, I was hoping omicron would basically push the other shit out
[21:07:09] <Dus10> yeah
[21:07:26] <Dus10> I tested positive Sunday on a home test after my daughter's PCR results came in
[21:07:35] <rawtaz> i see. how's it feeling?
[21:07:39] <Dus10> fully vax'd and all
[21:07:40] <rawtaz> at least you can type
[21:07:57] <Dus10> she must have picked it up at school
[21:08:01] <rawtaz> yeah no wonder. vaccine isnt about not getting it, it's about not becoming as sick :)
[21:08:13] <rawtaz> a lot of people, probably most, dont get that simple fact (not thinking about you now)
[21:08:23] <Dus10> not great...
[21:08:35] <Dus10> but not as bad as the first time I had it (presumably)
[21:08:50] <Dus10> I think I had it in February
[21:08:58] <Dus10> February 2020
[21:09:19] <Dus10> yeah, I explain that to people all of the time... it isn't invisible armor
[21:09:32] <Dus10> you still get infected, your body can just mount a quick response
[21:09:57] <Dus10> I had some violent chills last night
[21:10:12] <Dus10> Are you in Sweden, rawtaz?
[21:10:13] <rawtaz> i see. but in general it's like a cold i take it? or is it more like a flu?
[21:10:19] <rawtaz> yep i am! welcome over!
[21:10:26] <Dus10> like a flu
[21:10:33] <Dus10> Hej!
[21:10:37] <rawtaz> :D
[21:10:45] <Dus10> my Scandy sucks...
[21:10:56] <rawtaz> you got it 100% right there at least, so that's a good track record sofar :>
[21:11:00] <Dus10> better than my wife's though... and she is 2nd generation Norwegian
[21:11:20] <rawtaz> oh
[21:11:29] <rawtaz> norweigan is awesome :3
[21:11:51] <rawtaz> and the people there are too, for the most part (rotten eggs exist everywhere of course, but there's a good bunch of folks over there in general)
[21:12:13] <Dus10> if I ever can settle down enough... I always thought it would be awesome to go to Germany and take a foreign language course there, like Norwegian
[21:12:16] <Dus10> since I understand German
[21:12:43] <Dus10> I am sure a lot of folks do that with English as their intermediary language
[21:13:23] <Dus10> I have some Norwegian heritage, as well.... but much further removed
[21:13:41] <Dus10> kind of funny, all from a set of great-grandparents...
[21:14:08] <Dus10> one of direct Norwegian ancestry, and then another via Ireland... but the crew of folks that invaded Ireland :)
