[01:50:32] <mdogg> Well, I bought some eggnog a couple of days ago and I read that people commonly spike it with rum, or cherry, or brandy.  So I put a shot of rum into my glass of eggnog.  Was fine at first but I didn't do well an hour later.
[01:51:28] <blkshp> To be quite honest, I don't really know what it is. I remember the guy from Lethal Weapon that gets shot from the chopper drinking it out of a carton he got off a sideboard in the warm and that may have subconsiously put me off.
[01:51:29] <mdogg> I mean, logically I know myself that alcohol and dairy products aren't good mates.   
[01:52:13] <mdogg> Yeah..
[01:52:22] <blkshp> Baileys.
[01:52:29] <blkshp> The defense rests/
[01:52:31] <mdogg> lol - true.
[01:52:38] <mdogg> Ok ok ok
[01:52:52] <mdogg> That works but it shouldn't!
[01:53:05] <mdogg> Actually, it works very well.
[01:53:16] <blkshp> No, it shouldn't guaranteed to last 2 years open and unrefrigerated.
[01:53:47] <mdogg> Oh I always refrigerate it once it's opened.  But you're right, it doesn't say that it's required which I find odd.
[01:54:47] <blkshp> It's the alcohol, it makes it perfect for espressos
[01:55:26] <mdogg> It is delicious... I'll give you that.
[01:55:37] <mdogg> My mom loves it, of course.
[01:55:58] <mdogg> I prefer Kahlua in my coffee, though.
[01:56:07] <blkshp> oooh, kahlua, nom
[01:56:09] <blkshp> I have that too

[01:58:53] <mdogg> (so I'm not ending my sentence with a preposition)  =D

[02:00:43] <mdogg> Yeah, the milk would make me puke.

[14:54:50] <huf> definitely modern, not postmodern
[14:54:58] <Me-me> Both refer to practices in the present that represent the future. Futurism has connotations of technology and postmodernism has connotations of artistic works.
[14:55:37] <huf> this is why we now have retrofuturism
[14:55:44] <huf> because futurism is _old_ :D
[14:55:57] <huf> but to be fair, futuristic is distinct from futurism
[14:56:08] <huf> I was just conflating them for fun

[15:00:21] <Me-me> Well indeed.

[15:23:52] <darsie> Perhaps modernism once meant the 1980s and stuck to mean 1980s. So post modernism may have meant the 1990s, etc.

[20:44:42] <treflip> "Simon and Fiona stayed in a lovely cottage in the mountains for a week." Why do we say "a lovely cottage" but "in the mountains"? This is a card from Anki, so I can't provide any context :(
[20:45:45] <brigand> Why shouldn't there be a lovely cottage in the mountains?
[20:48:23] <Tanuki> "The mountains" is how you refer to an area with mountains.

[20:48:26] <Tanuki> Note the example:
[20:48:32] <Tanuki> We're going to the mountains (= an area where there are mountains) for our holiday.

[21:00:36] <Tanuki> Yeah -- Slavic languages in particular, as I understand it, don't have those.
[21:00:51] <Tanuki> So native speakers of those languages don't include them when speaking English.

[21:02:37] <Tanuki> Another difference that allows one to stop native vs. nonnative speakers is preposition usage.

[21:02:45] <chat> Tanuki meant to say: Another difference that allows one to spot native vs. nonnative speakers is preposition usage. 
[21:03:02] * LuisP14 goes and stops one
[21:03:18] <TimMc> Prepositions vary even by dialect.
[21:03:21] <Tanuki> Indeed.
[21:03:35] <Tanuki> For example, in New York, it's common to say "on line" as opposed to "in line" elsewhere.
[21:04:02] <TimMc> In another dialect it could easily be "at the mountains".
[21:04:08] <brigand> "Get on line"?
[21:04:24] <Tanuki> Right. "On the weekend" vs. "at the weekend."
[21:04:35] <Tanuki> The former is more common in America.

[21:05:54] <TimMc> British and American English even vary on use of articles -- "on holiday" and "in hospital" sound weird to my ears, but of course we have "in prison" which is a basically identical construction.
[21:06:04] <TimMc> (to the latter, at least)
[21:06:32] <Tanuki> There's also more obscure stuff, like discourse markers and filler words. "Like" is used a lot in American English as a discourse marker in colloquial speech, mostly restricted to native speakers.
[21:07:14] <TimMc> It was really obnoxious to watch Scooby Doo recently and hear how often "like" was used incorrectly.

[23:05:47] <jemius> Do you think it is easier for someone speaking a germanic language to learn another germanic language than it is for someone speaking a romanic or slavic language?
[23:06:18] <Tanuki> It depends.
[23:06:29] <LjL> mostly i'd say yes, but i'd call English a possible exception
[23:07:05] <jemius> LjL, you mean a native english speaker trying to learn something else?
[23:07:14] <LjL> both ways
[23:07:28] <LjL> English is choke-full of romance words, so much so that many of its native speakers actually seem to believe it *is* romance
[23:07:49] <Tanuki> I'm a native speaker of English (a Germanic language) currently learning German (another Germanic language). Now, this may seem promising at first BUT English is an exception because while it is Germanic in the sense that it shares basic vocabulary (numbers, family members, common verbs, etc.) with other Germanic languages, English has a boatload of Latin and Greek influence.
[23:08:29] <Tanuki> So it can be deceiving.
[23:08:39] <LjL> Tanuki, it has also lost must of the inflection, which German has retained the most (other germanic languages are kind of inbetween, except Icelandic/Faroese)
[23:08:49] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@pop.92-184-106-51.mobile.abo.orange.fr)
[23:08:57] <LjL> an English speaker is typically just about barely used to adding -s to things and that's it
[23:08:58] <Tanuki> If you mean the case-based grammar like what Latin has, FUCK that.
[23:09:06] <LjL> that, and verbs
[23:09:30] <LjL> the only verb that changes "almost" for every person in english is to be
[23:09:38] <LjL> (and even that one is all "are" in the plural)
[23:09:53] *** Quits: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy) (Quit: My iMac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:09:56] <Tanuki> Well, English still retains a bit of that stuff; for example, in some English grammar books, pronouns are distinguished as "nominative" (I, you, he, etc.) and "accusative" (him, her, etc.)
[23:09:57] <LjL> but still, i suspect English speakers will generally cope better with the verb conjugations than with the case system
[23:10:10] <Tanuki> It's not often called that, but some grammar books do classify it that way.
[23:10:12] <LjL> Tanuki, that's true for all romance languages too, but it barely helps
[23:10:20] <jemius> Latin is king of declinating and conjugating. German does it in large part by the articles, though. And I would think it is loosing it over time, as well. The Dative-e has gone during the last ~200 years
[23:11:02] <jemius> LjL, the romanic languages threw the cases etc. of Latin away. So romanic languages and English are not that far apart in this regard
[23:11:02] <LjL> jemius, yes it seems to be on its way to shedding some of the morphology... but i'm not sure, can you wait 200 more years before you start learning German? :P
[23:11:12] <Tanuki> There's also the Saxon genitive, which in English works for all nouns and with an apostrophe; in German, you can only use it with proper nouns, apparently, and it's directly tacked on, no apostrophe.
[23:11:13] <LjL> jemius, indeed
[23:12:15] <Tanuki> jemius: The case-based grammar itself was thrown away, but Romance languages do retain ways to distinguish the case. In Spanish, lo and la are for direct objects (accusative), le is for indirect objects (dative) and su, suyo, etc. is for genitive.
[23:12:25] <jemius> Tanuki, some germans use it with apostrophe. Probably due to english influence, believing it is correct
[23:12:44] <Tanuki> Right, I was taught that isn't the correct way to do it in German.
[23:12:55] <LjL> Tanuki, it's arguably not a "case" in English, though (although it certainly derives from one), because with cases in their strict meaning, it would *have* to be tacked onto the noun it's modifying, and any of its adjectives. in English, instead, it just goes at the end of the *noun phrase*. you can say "The man I met yesterday's car was broken" (this particular sentence would be a bit awkward and people would probably say it differently, but it's not ungrammatical)
[23:13:23] <LjL> Swedish has a similar "-s" (no apostrophe) but I can't do that in Swedish
[23:13:31] <Tanuki> Right.
