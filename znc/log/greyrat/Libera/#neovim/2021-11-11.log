[02:05:39] <ii14[m]> not sure tho
[02:05:48] <ii14[m]> no, you don't
[02:05:53] <bew[m]> ii14[m]: tried too, doesn't work
[02:05:55] <saltrocklamp[m]> how about `vim.api.foo` instead of `vim.api.nvim_foo` bfredl ;)
[02:06:12] <saltrocklamp[m]> or `nvim.api.foo` for that matter
[02:06:30] <gpanders> saltrocklamp[m]: you can define this yourself if you want to
[02:06:30] <ii14[m]> use backslashes to escape newlines
[02:06:35] <saltrocklamp[m]> i bet you can do that with a lua metatable thing right? where you make a table that strips off the `nvim_` prefix

[02:41:13] <dundargoc> ah the jit
[02:41:16] <tk> so I've used , for leader for a long time, but I noticed that space is a better leader key, I have a few new keybindings and I can get used to them fine but there's some , bindings I have which date back many years and I'm struggling to adjust. I've changed leader to space and then I have a map , <leader> but the problem is that this un-silences all leader mappings which I have mapped as silent, if
[02:41:17] <tk> I make map silent then it silences all leader mappings (and some of my mappings pre-fill a command and let you enter the rest)
[02:41:24] <Bowuigi[m]> Lol
[02:41:27] <bfredl> luajit does implement its extensions, but this one should be the same as standard 5.1
[02:41:40] <tk> is there a nice way to sort this out where it doesn't de-silence / silence things which should be silent / shouldn't be silent?

[11:30:57] <dre> mjlbach[m], sorry to bother, but you've commented on the most recent github issue I've seen. I've got sumneko_lua installed, but when I open up a ~/test.lua I get 'Client 1 quit with exit code 1 and signal 0' 
[11:31:33] <mjlbach[m]> issue with your install I assume
[11:31:39] <dre> I did get a nice big red error that pointed me to this: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16242
[11:32:20] <dre> mjlbach[m], as in the compiled binary? or the config setup? because I copied the lua setup from the lsp_config docs. 
[11:32:32] <dre> making sure that the paths were set sensibly.
[11:32:33] <mjlbach[m]> the config setup is fine
[11:32:49] <dre> okie

[12:22:11] <kylo252[m]> so single-file-mode is basically you adding that file to your existing workspace

[12:23:32] <mjlbach[m]> Option B: Open a new server per language, the problem is that starts mixing a ton of imports depending on if the server supports cross-file stuff without a workspaceFolder/root
[12:23:45] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: the important thing for me is the refactor itself
[12:23:45] <kylo252[m]> the underlying implementation can just be swapped out for something different if it doesn't work for some reason

[12:25:38] <kylo252[m]> the only problem, but it's probably an old one, is the parent root_dir validation

[13:19:13] <ksynwa> Does vim/neovim allow something like an alias? Like I would like to be able to run `:PackerSync` by running `:PS`.
[13:19:16] <dundargoc> mjlbach[m]: Now, now, let's not be unreasonable ;)
[13:20:30] <dundargoc> Random question  at the top of my head: which server would you say is the most compliant?
[13:20:44] <clason[m]> texlab!
[13:20:49] <clason[m]> üòÅ
[13:20:55] <mjlbach[m]> clangd is pretty good, but it has the offSpec utf-8 extension
[13:21:09] <mjlbach[m]> which IMO is actually a worthwhile thing to have hah
[13:21:26] <Mathias[m]> Most of the capabilities are optional in the spec, so a server not supporting formatting doesn't make it non-compliant 
[13:21:54] <dundargoc> Aha, didn't know that
[13:22:14] <clason[m]> (although that depends: do you mean "which server adheres most closely to the spec as written", or "which server implements the most (optional) features"?)
[13:22:22] <mjlbach[m]> I took it to mean had little off-spec extensions
[13:22:26] <ksynwa> Seems like `:command PS PackerSync` will do it
[13:22:28] <mjlbach[m]> while implementing most of the spec
[13:22:51] <clason[m]> and didn't "implement what VS Code expects" rather than "what's written in the spec"
[13:23:24] <dundargoc> mjlbach[m]: You get me
[13:23:24] <Mathias[m]> mjlbach[m]: But they're kinda additional and if done right don't cause issues on clients not implementing them

[13:24:08] <dundargoc> That "if done right" sticks out a bit :)
[13:24:30] *** Joins: gxt (~gxt@gateway/tor-sasl/gxt)
[13:25:26] <Mathias[m]> yeah, for example eclipse.jdt.ls got workspace edits wrong (I think in part because they supported it before it got added into the spec, but could be wrong about that). 
[13:25:26] <Mathias[m]> All other extensions they did are opt-in and don't cause any problems if missing on the client, you just have less functionality

[13:29:55] <Mathias[m]> dundargoc: Just part of how standards develop. People want to add features that are missing, so they invent their variant (ideally proposing it to the standard at the same time). Sometimes that goes well, sometimes not

[13:39:50] <low-key> or is it simply the way it is supposed to be?

[13:41:28] <dundargoc> If you mean on startup that's a separate issue I think
[13:41:45] <dundargoc> It's just pyright booting up or something.

[19:36:44] <saltrocklamp[m]> the docs say `setup =` is called _before_ the plugin is loaded... but maybe that's necessary for a `start/` plugin, since there's no real way to hook into "before" without modifying the plugin itself (or asking the user to source something in `init.vim`)
[19:37:13] <saltrocklamp[m]> i suppose there's an argument to be made for packer putting _everything_ in `opt` and then `:packadd`-ing the `opt = false` stuff

[19:50:38] <clason[m]> <saltrocklamp[m]> "the docs say `setup =` is called..." <- `setup` (or, in fact, nearly _any_ key) already implies `opt` + shenanigans with `packer_compiled.lua`
[19:51:31] <saltrocklamp[m]> that's my point bfredl , there's no way for packer to compile a plugin script that is guaranteed to run before the user's `start/` plugins, ergo the user _must_ manually run something in their init script, or `opt/` shenanigans must occur as per what clason said

[20:14:59] <saltrocklamp[m]> i wish traditional vimscript plugins used the `myplugin#setup()` pattern that lua plugins use
[20:15:31] <saltrocklamp[m]> it makes a lot of things a lot easier to manage, instead of relying on the startup sequencing which can get complicated

[20:16:16] <saltrocklamp[m]> there was a time when my config was entirely `opt/` plugins and i had a big list of `:packadd!`s in my config
[20:17:17] <saltrocklamp[m]> although arguably the right thing to do is have a `plugin/` script that invokes `:packadd` (without `!`) but where you explicitly control the pre/post config stuff
[20:17:37] <saltrocklamp[m]> (the goal is to have less of a sprawling configuration where 1 plugin gets "configured" in 2 or 3 different places)
[20:18:49] <saltrocklamp[m]> so instead of having to write `let g:myplugin#enable_mappings = ` before loading the plugin, it'd be nicer imo to write `call myplugin#setup({'enable_mappings': 0})` which is what lua plugins seem to have mostly converged on doing

[20:29:19] <gpanders> au contraire
[20:29:20] <gpanders> give me more `vim.g.plugin_name_foo` pls
[20:29:24] <gpanders> it has 0 runtime cost
[20:29:41] <gpanders> `require("plugin").setup()` means I have to load your whole plugin just to set some option
[20:29:43] <saltrocklamp[m]> that's valid, but how much cost is it really to invoke 1 extra function call?
[20:29:47] <gpanders> even if I never actually use it
[20:29:50] <Bowuigi[m]> Hmmm
[20:30:24] <saltrocklamp[m]> `require()` is effectively lazy-loading and (afaik) it's not recursive, so `require('foo')` doesn't also `require('foo.bar.baz')`
[20:30:26] <gpanders> configuration and execution should be separate. The `require().setup()` pattern mixes the two
[20:30:29] <Bowuigi[m]> Doesn't `whatever.setup {}` just wake up a lazy loaded plugin?
[20:30:32] <clason[m]> gpanders: But it need not.
[20:30:41] <gpanders> true, but it often does
[20:30:46] <clason[m]> This just means the design of the plugin is not optimal
[20:30:54] <Bowuigi[m]> True, you can cache the require
[20:31:03] <gpanders> yes
[20:31:04] <gpanders> or
[20:31:08] <gpanders> just use `vim.g` which is 1000x simpler
[20:31:13] <gpanders> and doesn't require any fanciness
[20:31:21] <clason[m]> (Which is easy to complain about since we don't have decades of shared expertise on how to design a good Lua plugin, like we have in Vimscript)
[20:31:24] <saltrocklamp[m]> i guess i don't understand the issue. if you write `let g:myplugin#foo = ` and you actually want it to take effect, then you have to load `myplugin` somehow! 
[20:31:48] <clason[m]> I much prefer the centralized config. 
[20:31:55] <Bowuigi[m]> local some_plugin = require("some_plugin")
[20:31:55] <Bowuigi[m]> some_plugin.setup {}
[20:31:55] <Bowuigi[m]> some_plugin.myfunction "string"
[20:32:09] <clason[m]> Especially since it guarantees that the whole state is controlled through that single call
[20:32:10] <Bowuigi[m]> You can have both on the same place
[20:32:16] <gpanders> saltrocklamp[m]: the thing is not every plugin is used in every session of Neovim
[20:32:22] <clason[m]> no random `vim.g.foo` lying around
[20:32:30] <gpanders> so I can set config settings for `myplugin` even if I never invoke `myplugin`
[20:32:36] <Bowuigi[m]> Use the setup for running but also the cache for configuring
[20:32:41] <gpanders> whereas with `myplugin.setup()` I have to load your plugin, even if I don't use it
[20:32:42] <YorickPeterse[m]> gpanders: When was the last time you wanted to set an option, but not load the plugin?
[20:32:55] <gpanders> YorickPeterse[m]: I don't use Telescope every time I open Neovim

[20:33:03] <gpanders> the list goes on
[20:33:06] <saltrocklamp[m]> well if you _don't_ load the plugin, then who cares what `g:myplugin#foo` is set to gpanders ? at that point you might as well set the setting right when the plugin _is_ loaded. which is what you do with the `.setup()` pattern
[20:33:07] <gpanders> so basically, every day
[20:33:20] <YorickPeterse[m]> gpanders: so then how do you load those plugins?
[20:33:27] <Bowuigi[m]> local p = require("plugin")
[20:33:27] <Bowuigi[m]> p.settings.foo = "bar";
[20:33:35] <gpanders> saltrocklamp[m]: ok so now i have to create a wrapper that configures the plugin when I load it
[20:33:36] <gpanders> which is what I end up doing
[20:33:43] <gpanders> but it all becomes more complex than it should
[20:33:45] <gpanders> When Vim script plugins figured this out years ago
[20:33:55] <gpanders> I realize I'm just going on a cranky old man rant right now
[20:34:06] <gpanders> so please indulge me. Or don't and tell me to stfu and go away :)
[20:34:08] <saltrocklamp[m]> no i think this is an important difference in opinion/style
[20:34:09] <Bowuigi[m]> I have a fix
[20:34:53] <gpanders> YorickPeterse[m]: so for e.g. Telescope I create my own `:Telescope` command that calls an `s:load()` command that does `packadd telescope` followed by the whole `require().setup()` dance
[20:34:59] <gpanders> so I don't pay any cost for telescope unless i use it
[20:35:00] <saltrocklamp[m]> it sounds like you want to be able to declaratively specify all your configs in one place, and then have the plugin be loaded through the normal `pack/*/start/` system and not have to think about _applying_ the config explicitly
[20:35:06] <gpanders> but this feels unnecessary. it shouldn't have to be this way
[20:35:09] <YorickPeterse[m]> gpanders: Ah. Personally I despise lazy loading of code (in general, not just in nvim), so at least I end up loading my plugins always (this is fast enough anyway). I'd also argue that if a plugin needs lazy loading, it's doing too much.
[20:35:20] <YorickPeterse[m]> I wonder if an official config mechanism would work
[20:35:36] <gpanders> YorickPeterse[m]: difference in philosophy I guess. I _always_ want everything lazy loaded, in principle I don't want to pay for something if I'm not using it
[20:35:41] <mjlbach[m]> Requires can be made lazy
[20:35:41] <YorickPeterse[m]> At least one where your options don't have to go through Vimscript (e.g. making it easier to store local functions)
[20:35:44] <mjlbach[m]> * made lazy without lazy loading

[20:36:26] <gpanders> as clason pointed out there are ways to use `require().setup()` without loading the entire plugin, but this seems to be rare in practice...
[20:36:32] <YorickPeterse[m]> `vim.config.telescope = { ... }` or something like that, where `vim.config` automatically creates the table
[20:36:46] <YorickPeterse[m]> since all plugins basically follow the same pattern of "take table, merge with defaults"
[20:36:49] <clason[m]> gpanders: To be fair, it has gotten a lot better in recent months
[20:36:55] <Bowuigi[m]> Bowuigi[m]: Your configs are all on a single place, including the Vim ones
[20:37:06] <saltrocklamp[m]> gpanders: my one problem w/ that setup is that i now have to separate the "do before" stuff from the "do after" stuff. historically i disliked having 50% of my config in one place and 50% in the other place.
[20:37:06] <YorickPeterse[m]> added benefit being you can detach it from the plugin, and dump your settings easier

[20:41:18] <YorickPeterse[m]> I feel lazy loading is a treatment of a symptom, not a proper solution. That is, lazy loading is used because loading a plugin results in too much work being done at once. This is similar to e.g. Ruby on Rails code computing half the planet when loaded, so everything is lazy loaded in development
[20:41:23] <YorickPeterse[m]> (which brings many of its own issues)

[21:53:46] <saltrocklamp[m]> does that only apply to vim and not nvim?

[21:55:00] <saltrocklamp[m]> i assume it also sources `*.lua` files? that isn't mentioned anywhere in that section either
[21:56:51] <saltrocklamp[m]> imo all this info should be moved to `|pack-add|` anyway. maybe it's worth putting a patch together for vim upstream to write this in a more understandable format
[21:58:17] <saltrocklamp[m]> i would also love to know how these ended up in `repeat.txt` of all places, and not a separate `packages.txt` file
[21:58:54] <saltrocklamp[m]> `Repeating commands, Vim scripts and debugging` weird mix of concepts
[21:59:16] <saltrocklamp[m]> maybe the idea is that it all falls under the category of "reusing things"

[22:15:33] <bfredl> technically, loading the same packages every time you start vim/nvim is a form of repeating.
[22:15:33] <bfredl> but I get your point :)

[22:59:42] <yin> is there a way to change highlight group precedence? if not, is there a simple way to highlight all instances of the current word *except* the current word?

[23:02:08] <ahmed-rezk-devAh> Hey guys. I'm having a problem getting nvim-ts-rainbow and line indent highlight to work with TSX files. Any idea why? I'm using indent-blankline.nvim for line indent.
