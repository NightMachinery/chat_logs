[02:45:23] <causative> we do find that movements that disagree on what is moral, also disagree on what is true, and it is the factual disagreement that leads to the moral disagreement.  If they agreed on what is true, they would also agree - or at least agree more - on what is moral.
[02:47:06] <causative> someone says "God hates abortions" - this is not a merely moral position, it is also a factual position about the attitude of God. If they changed their belief about the fact (whether God hates abortions), they would also change their attitude about whether abortion is moral.

[09:17:19] <causative> some systems for finding the truth are more effective than other systems
[09:18:15] <causative> it is possible to be wrong - if you have no way of checking your work, it is likely that you are wrong.
[09:19:18] <causative> truth and falsehood are not just matters of opinion
[09:21:37] <thunder> I feel that the sense of "truth" results from a perceived internal consistency and interrelationship between the meanings associated with whatever question is at issue. irrational vs ration, really only consists of whether emotion or thought is the primary criteria for correlating meannigs in this context.
[09:21:58] <Player001> did I walk into the middle of a conversation?
[09:22:06] <causative> internal consistency is not the same as truth
[09:22:07] <thunder> no. just started
[09:22:11] <Player001> LOL
[09:22:18] <Player001> causative has a crush
[09:22:39] <causative> the quality of your contributions is very low, Player001
[09:22:48] <Player001> LMAO
[09:24:02] <causative> we should trust a proposition depending on the quality of the system that produced it. If the system has robust ways to detect and flag its own errors, its conclusions are more trustworthy.
[09:24:37] <thunder> causative: if you take math theory, it may be consistent within it's own framework, yet not applicable to all things. for instance euclidian geometry is self-consistent with the concepts of the point and a plain, and the straight edge of compass. yet as descriptive and self-constent as this system is, it cannot trisect an arbitrary angle, square the circle, construct a regular heptagram, etc.
[09:25:03] <thunder> what makes it logical and "true" (at least according to it's own criteria) is it's internal consistency
[09:25:50] <thunder> similarly, if a person's reasoning is primarily emotion centered, the internal consistency of their sense of "truth" in meaning, stems from emotional correlations rather than consistency of thought.
[09:26:36] <thunder> and compass*
[09:27:44] <causative> thunder, an insane person could believe anything whatsoever, and still be internally consistent, if he considers nothing to be a contradiction
[09:28:14] <thunder> exactly my point. but that's an emotional judgement.
[09:28:31] <causative> and would you say that he is right?
[09:28:53] <thunder> by his own criteria yes. by others, no.
[09:29:18] <thunder> just like non-euclidian geometry is "wrong" by euclidian standards
[09:29:20] <causative> When I ask you, "would you say that he is right?" whose criteria am I asking about?
[09:29:47] <thunder> exactly my point
[09:29:58] <causative> I'm asking about *your* criteria
[09:30:08] <causative> so tell me, would you say that he is right?
[09:30:18] <thunder> my criteria is understanding the sense of truth, not in passing judgement about absolutes
[09:30:32] <thunder> truth is relative
[09:31:10] <causative> so when you said by others' criteria he is not right, you were not including yourself
[09:31:30] <thunder> my criteria is understanding the sense of truth, not in passing judgement about absolutes
[09:31:35] *** Joins: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro)
[09:31:39] <causative> by your criteria, you refuse to pass judgment on whether the insane person was right when he said the sky is made of grease
[09:31:57] <causative> or that rabbits are the best pilots
[09:32:22] <causative> this is an accurate representation of your position?
[09:33:22] <thunder> how could I help such a person if I refuse to understand their frame of reference? and what is the point of being "right" if it's not to help them (presumably because their delusion poses a danger to self or others)?
[09:34:03] <causative> I didn't say anything about whether you understood their frame of reference
[09:34:14] <causative> I might understand it as well, but I still say the insane person would be wrong
[09:34:22] <causative> to understand something is not to affirm it
[09:34:27] <thunder> I did. what is so important about being the absolute arbitor of truth? what makes you believe that's even possible?
[09:35:18] <causative> nearly everyone - with the exception of people who buy into this weird brand of truth-denying philosophy - *does* make assertions and consider the assertions they make to be right
[09:35:32] <thunder> yes. if a person contends that the sky is made of grease, I would probably laugh, but think about the petroleum industry
[09:35:49] <Player001> causative: I thought you were a pragmatist
[09:35:56] <causative> in fact you've made a lot of assertions just now
[09:36:14] <causative> you may claim to reserve judgment but everything you've said to me is a judgment you've made
[09:36:25] <causative> as is everything I've said
[09:36:34] <thunder> if they said rabbits are the best pilots, I would have a harder time understanding them, but having seen enough fiction, I wouldn't call them crazy right off the bat, but probably take it for a pop culture reference of some kind
[09:37:25] <causative> it is possible to at once understand how different systems of reasoning arise and work internally, *and* to unflinchingly assert the results of your *own* system of reasoning
[09:37:31] <thunder> doubt is custodian of truth
[09:37:33] <causative> which you do all the time anyway
[09:37:48] <causative> every statement you've made is a statement you've asserted true
[09:37:54] <causative> like the one just now
[09:38:01] <thunder> truth is custodian of doubt
[09:38:07] <causative> and again
[09:38:31] <thunder> yin/yang
[09:38:40] <thunder> each contains it's opposite
[09:39:30] <causative> it's wrong to associate "truth" and "doubt" - they are different kinds of thing.  "confidence" and "doubt" are associated. but truth is truth whether you doubt it or assert it
[09:39:46] <thunder> courage is custodian of fear
[09:39:49] <causative> truth/falsehood, confidence/doubt
[09:39:50] <thunder> fear is custodian of courage
[09:40:03] <thunder> those are different kinds of things, yet those are still truthy statements about them
[09:40:32] <causative> it's right to associate fear and courage, they're both emotions
[09:40:45] <causative> but truth is a matter of the way things *are*, and doubt or confidence are a matter of the way you *think* they are
[09:40:51] <causative> it's an important distinction
[09:41:10] <causative> surely you agree, that the way you think things are, is not always the way they are?

[09:42:34] <thunder> wasd: posted that around a week back. it's interesting.
[09:43:39] <thunder> the real world is true, but the moment we attempt to describe it using language we enter the realm of imagination/thought about it
[09:43:52] <thunder> there's no escaping that
[09:43:53] *** Quits: econo (uid147250@user/econo) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[09:44:07] <causative> of course there isn't
[09:44:19] <causative> but when you say "truth" remember you are talking about the real world
[09:44:30] <causative> when you say "belief" "doubt" remember that is about your thoughts
[09:44:35] <thunder> "talking" being the operative word
[09:44:40] <causative> yes
[09:44:55] <thunder> the map is not the territory
[09:45:02] <Player001> accepting the correspondence theory of truth that is
[09:45:11] <causative> thunder, this is exactly the point I have been insisting to you!
[09:45:24] <causative> truth is about the territory, belief or doubt is about the map
[09:45:56] <thunder> how can you know if what the person perceives as true is true, if you don't even know what territory their map is describing?
[09:46:22] <causative> we never know anything for sure
[09:46:33] <thunder> hence doubt is custodian of truth
[09:46:33] <causative> but we make our best judgment on the available evidence
[09:46:43] <thunder> hence truth is custodian of doubt
[09:46:47] <causative> doubt is a quality of the map, truth is a quality of the territory
[09:46:53] <causative> they aren't two sides of the same coin
[09:47:03] <causative> they're in different domains
[09:47:04] <thunder> of course they are
[09:47:27] <DPA> There was some QM experiment showing that 2 observers could in certain situations prove opposing observations to be true. So "the real world is true" may not always be the case.
[09:47:53] <causative> you have to take two steps to get from truth to doubt:  first from truth to confident belief (moving from the territory to the map) and then from confident belief to doubt
[09:48:02] <thunder> DPA: if you can find that paper I'm interested

[09:51:46] <causative> and remember there is a distinction between a claim of truth, and truth
[09:52:23] <causative> when I say "X is true" this does not mean that X is true; it means I claim X is true.  Conversely, if I claim X is true, this means I am willing to say "X is true"; and so should you.
[09:52:33] <Player001> also DPA, don't listen to him, many-worlds just agrees with the evidence but so does every other interpretation of quantum mechanics

[09:53:40] <Player001> pop-science fan I see
[09:54:14] <thunder> the ojibwe language has a nice word "w'daeb-awae'". it's used in conversation in places we would say "it's true" or "you're/they're right". but it's a philosophical proposition. the phrase conveys that one casts one's words and one's voice only as far as vocabulary and perception will enable and as accurately as one can describe it, given one's command of language and the limitations of language. assigned to a speaker, it confirmed credibility at the
[09:54:14] <thunder> time yet allowed for later reassessment and a change of vision without the assigning of fault if the situation changed.
[09:54:22] <causative> there's basically no reason to make the assumption of collapse, except as a way to make the results more consistent with naive physical intuition
[09:54:49] <causative> and this is not appropriate in QM, which is by nature very different from naive physical intuition
[09:55:06] <causative> even theories with collapse, still do have many-worlds before the collapse happens

[10:00:03] <thunder> maybe gravity doesn't exist as a distinct force, but is the aggregate or product of other as yet unknown forces. but I can still observe an effect we call "gravity" nonetheless. assuming gravity doesn't exist as a thing in itself, am I wrong to still believe in gravity?

[10:07:12] * thunder nods
[10:07:50] <causative> elenchus is like debugging, for systems of beliefs
[10:08:14] <causative> when you debug a program, you put watchpoints and breakpoints to see what is going on at relevant points in the program

[10:08:43] *** Quits: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[10:08:56] <causative> in elenchus you do the same:  you ask questions to gather information, and try to find the root cause of the strange belief, the point of divergence between your beliefs and theirs
[10:10:11] <causative> and perhaps you may resolve this point of divergence one way or another, using additional evidence, so that you both agree on it.  And after that, you may be able to agree on the consequences as well, tracing back down the chain, so that eventually you agree on the original proposition in question.
[10:11:26] <causative> this doesn't mean the other person adopts your view - you may adopt his, or you both may agree on a synthesis of the two, or a third and more comprehensive view entirely
[10:13:02] <Player001> MWI is actually very Kantian
[10:13:37] <causative> so it's like you're debugging two programs at once:  your belief system, and his.  You see that they do not agree - this is the bug.  So you try to figure out why, and adjust one or the other, according to the evidence, until they do agree.

[10:43:37] <DPA> This Kantianism thing looks interesting. Or at least the idea to check if an action applied universially would cause it to no longer be performable.
[10:43:38] <DPA> Currently, in robotics, it's mainly comparing the current state to the desired state, and determinig the least steps necessary to turn one into the other. But without prior input, what would be a desirable new state? This may be usable to determine that some things may not be.

[11:05:08] <causative> thunder, "all" is meaningful when you qualify it, like "all... of the apples on the tree"
[11:05:24] <causative> just to say "All" is holding a word with religious reverence without a picture in mind of what you mean by it

[11:05:44] <causative> "all physical phenomena" is meaningful
[11:06:10] <causative> "all theorems of ZFC" is meaningful
[11:06:33] <causative> but just "all" - not meaningful.  Even beyond the problem of its meaninglessness, you run into the paradoxes of naive set theory
[11:07:03] <causative> the paradoxes of naive set theory were solved by always qualifying a universal quantifier - never permit "Forall x," always require "Forall x in Y"
[11:07:27] <DPA> Although, thinking about this a bit more, my idea to use it may not have been very practical.
[11:07:55] <Player001> Kant posits the noumenal realm, the thing-in-itself, as a way to suture the antinomies he's found in reality.
[11:08:04] <thunder> DPA: this presumes that the universe is a closed system with exact balance of all laws. we presume that's true, and we use theories based on that idea. but like saying "all swans are white", it's inductive reasoning and only truthful up to present knowledge. it can't preclude future falsification.
[11:08:27] <thunder> such as a single black swan, or many
[11:09:34] <Player001> We have a similar process in MWI: we want to suture the fact that the actual falls short of the possible, that we only end up with a single result of the massive number of possibilities the wave-function shows possible
[11:09:36] <causative> DPA, how do you imagine that could play out? like say we just have a bunch of ants running around in a world where they can collect food particles that drop randomly
[11:10:01] <causative> "stay where you are and starve to death" is something possible for all actors to do
[11:10:15] <causative> but you probably don't want your ants to behave that way
[11:10:42] <DPA> Yes, but now repeat that. The model will show they can't do it, so they decide not to do it.
[11:10:44] <thunder> causative: when you say just "all" - not meaningful. isn't this what we were just discussion the other night with you on the other side of the argument?
[11:10:55] <causative> no on the contrary DPA the model would show they *can* do it
[11:10:57] <Player001> in MWI we say, "what if all possibilities were also actualities"
[11:11:02] <causative> what stops them from staying where they are and starving?
[11:11:07] <thunder> not that I mind the devil's advocate mind you
[11:11:27] <causative> thunder, I don't know what you mean, what did I say last night that sounded like the other side of this?
[11:12:06] <DPA> causative: This is why it's first applied a few times to the model. How can they starve after they starved? They can't. The model will show it before they try.
[11:12:10] <thunder> we were discussing over the past few days the symbolic order and how initially symbols have no meaning until subject/predicate are united to exclude and therefore create meaning
[11:12:45] <causative> DPA, after they starved there are no actors
[11:12:53] <causative> so it is still possible for all actors to stay where they are and starve
[11:13:06] <thunder> like if you say "all" it has too much meaning to have much meaning. until it's followed by "...apples" or whatever
[11:13:15] <causative> because "all" by that point is none
[11:13:15] <DPA> Why would I implement it like that?
[11:14:53] <causative> thunder, I don't think it's really related
[11:15:01] <thunder> sure it is
[11:15:05] <causative> the other day the discussion was about the color black, and you thought "black" must always invoke all black objects
[11:15:35] <causative> that's not the same thing
[11:16:01] <causative> DPA, so what you're saying is, you want the agents to behave by a rule that makes the most agents survive if they follow the rule
[11:16:08] <thunder> you could replace "all" with "dog" and it would still. "dog" doesn't say anything of it's own. sure it could mean anything resembling or related to a dog in some way, but that's far too vague to mean much. it's not until you add "...the bounty hunter" that meaning is created through that destruction of meaning

[11:18:22] <causative> they teach stuff that is not exactly how humans do it
[11:18:40] <causative> the best language models today are *neural* models, and no one knows exactly how they work
[11:18:45] <thunder> oh. I see what you mean. you want a model which extrapolates to all languages based on a universal abstraction
[11:18:52] <causative> even to one language
[11:19:11] <Player001> Kant posits the noumenal realm, the thing-in-itself, as a way to suture the antinomies he's found in reality. We have a similar process in MWI: we want to suture the fact that the actual falls short of the possible, that we only end up with a single result of the massive number of possibilities the wave-function shows possible. The wave-function (appears to) collapse. In MWI we say, "What if all possibilities were also actualities?" This kind
[11:19:11] <Player001> of ontological completeness is All ("all possibilities are realized")
[11:19:13] <thunder> subject/predicate, object +/- object complement
[11:19:16] <causative> if you try to parse English by applying grammatical rules, it doesn't always work
[11:19:32] <causative> like, there's the "buffalo" sentence
[11:19:39] <causative> there are all sorts of edge cases
[11:19:57] <causative> sometimes the parsing depends on background knowledge
[11:20:01] <Player001> as opposed to non-All ("not all possibilities are realized")
[11:21:35] <thunder> causative: when we speak, there's no punctuation nor spelling. so homophones work, but apostrophes, commas, and so on, dont necessarily. this is one of the ways we tell jokes, but allowing the ambiguity of meaning to persist and cause a double/poly entendre
[11:21:50] <thunder> by allowing*
[11:22:10] <thunder> so having more than one way to parse a sentence is actually useful
[11:22:26] <causative> thunder, what I'm saying is, I don't think that when I read the word "black" it calls to mind all black objects
[11:22:36] <causative> it just doesn't invoke any meaning until I see more words around it to give it context
[11:22:55] <causative> it might invoke *one* black object, sometimes, as a template
[11:23:01] <causative> like I might think of a raven
[11:23:24] <causative> but whether I think of a raven or not, it's not really relevant to how I understand the whole sentence
[11:23:26] <causative> which is done holistically
[11:23:41] <causative> or at least looking at several parts at once, not token by token
[11:24:02] <thunder> causative: I believe (from personal experience) that when I see the word "black" anything associated with what that word means to me including coincidences like "block" etc, could possibly surface to mind depending on situational context and/or emotional intensity of the recollection
[11:24:19] <Player001> thunder: I think causative might be right in this instance
[11:24:50] <Player001> remember, the meaning of each signifier is metonymically deferred to the end of the sentence
[11:24:58] <thunder> okay. I actually see what he's getting at
[11:25:48] <thunder> I pay a lot of attention to the voices in my head, so for me that kind of random surfacing of impressions is a day to day normal experience
[11:26:10] <causative> that depends on the person
[11:26:30] <causative> I pay a lot of attention to how I think, and I don't do it with a lot of words much of the time
[11:26:41] <thunder> like, it often makes me chuckle, that when I think of alphabet characters in my head, they almost always have colours
[11:26:46] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[11:26:53] <causative> much of my thought is nonverbal
[11:27:28] <thunder> I figure this is because when I learned the alphabet in kindergarten, they were coloured pieces of cardboard glued around the top of the wall of the classroom

[11:27:57] <causative> "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they [feared/advocated] violence. "
[11:28:17] <causative> how the sentence should be parsed depends on whether "feared" or "advocated" is used

[11:30:22] <arryana> oops
[11:30:58] <Player001> like these signifiers are closely linked in the signifying chain
[11:31:03] <pussipupu> The voices in my head tell me up adopt American teenagers, lock my guns away, make plans for disasters and refrain from setting forests on fire

[12:16:26] <arryana> somehow i imagine it has to do with saunas and making things
[12:16:51] <thunder> it's a trait of narcissistic behaviour to be hostile to one person and then immediately seek reassurance/comradarie with another. it's a type of relational aggression power strategy.
[12:18:09] <thunder> that and projecting the victim into an "other" category through labelling and so on
[12:18:32] <arryana> if you're just going to be abusive because i wasn't impressed with your playing shrink, i'm just going to ignore you

[12:19:36] <thunder> there are only 2 reasons to take offence to what another person says. #1. you believe it's true. #2. you believe others will believe it's true. either way the offence comes from fear/dislike of the implications.

[15:25:18] <darsin> but please if you have any explanation why this natural speed of fall is absent in the ocean then let me know
[15:25:40] <darsin> my postulation is that objects fall per their mass
[15:26:06] <darsin> not because of this stupid invincible force thats pulling everything to the center
[15:26:59] <darsin> europe can enslave my body, they can have all the lands on the earth mister causative, but the last thing you would have is my mind period
[15:27:18] <darsin> nonsense
[15:29:02] <thunder> the easy way to test that would be to place objects in a vaccum chamber (to rule out wind resistance) and drop them from a sufficiently large height. take two objects with clearly different mass, and use either high frame rate photography and/or a laser trip wire to trigger the stopwatch for each object at the bottom. it shouldn't be super hard to setup even with fairly rudimentary equipment, as long as you take all the measurements correctly.

[15:31:23] <darsin> like according to science, gravity is how the earth gets its form and remains together
[15:31:32] <thunder> to convince anyone other than yourself you'll need to rule out the other variables which could (and theoretically do) effect the measurment
[15:32:17] <darsin> and all of a sudden, a simple wind would make light objects go upwards? ehh thunder, cmon son, let's not strattle the fence here
[15:32:27] <darsin> its all mind control bull piss
[15:32:28] <thunder> as for the vacuum chamber, it's simply a sealed container of whatever size and a vacuum pump rated for that number of cubic feet/meters
[15:33:02] <thunder> doesn't have to be super high tech
[15:33:21] <darsin> science is just another form of christianity period, it has no true value or power within it

[15:45:35] <thunder> it dovetails well with my occult/spirituality pursuit. particularly when practising mindfulness meditation I can use it as a template to see how my own direct cognitive experience matches up with the theory I've learned. to see if I gain insights from it to better understand and help myself and others.
[15:45:37] <darsin> and about the flat earth ish thunder, you don't have to go to the internet to know what you can ask someone just close to you, am like a click away. and i have told you where to start from
[15:46:13] <thunder> it's not really a subject that interests me tbh
[15:46:30] <darsin> yeah you said
[15:46:36] <darsin> which is understandable
[15:46:52] <darsin> but for me it's really painful
[15:47:10] <darsin> cuz i have been reading encyclopedias since i was 10 years old
[15:47:35] <thunder> darsin: I was at an activist event several years ago with a bunch of indigenous people, and the event started off with this caucasian guy telling a story about evolution from a science perspective. the indigenous people I was standing with started to look a bit uncomfortable as if they felt talked down to. I turned to the guy next to me and remarked "every culture has it's creation stories". he just smiled and said "that's what I was thinking"
[15:47:58] <darsin> so it's really satanic that someone would really deceive a child like that
[15:49:16] <darsin> like looking at the big encyclopedias that my dad would load in a box while returning from the united kingdom, i would be like wow, mad knowledge. i would read it all up and feel like am wise
[15:49:43] <darsin> i would go about telling people things i know and they say yooo, he's really smart
[15:49:55] <darsin> just to turn around and find it's all lies thunder
[15:50:12] <darsin> its really not nice, it's very disturbing really
[15:50:46] <thunder> I wouldn't say it's *all* lies, but the eurocentric encyclopedias are definitely written from a rather haughty colonialist perspective towards other cultures

[15:51:45] <darsin> but no issues
[15:51:58] <darsin> the good thing is i have my mind back
[15:52:00] <thunder> what irks me is so many uses of the past tense when describing existing cultures which barely survived being genocided by european conquest. they still exist, but are treated like they're dead cultures.
[15:53:47] <thunder> when I was a kid I read the dictionary and encyclopedias voraciously, and one of my pass times was to find all the past-tense mistakes concerning living indigenous cultures and correcting the phrases with red pen
[15:53:49] <darsin> and about every culture has its creation story, also points to the fact of where humanity is at intellectual wise, like i don't care about how the earth was created, you can just say you don't know and matter solved
[15:54:53] <darsin> but about the orientation of the earth, can we say we don't know? that would just be a lazy statement
[15:54:59] <thunder> that's where I'm at. I find the stories interesting, but I can only take someone else's word for it.
[15:55:14] <thunder> my own experience on the other hand, isn't mediated by anyone else
[15:55:31] <darsin> cuz the earth is here right now and we can study it directly and make honest conclusions about our findings
[15:55:34] <thunder> and major elements/patterns of my experience extrapolate reliably to others
[15:58:12] <darsin> i don't understand what you mean by the indigenous people's culture being spoken in past tense
[16:01:31] <darsin> and when i hear psychoanalysis, i think of analyzing the psyche. what would be the use of mindfulness for you, what does it really achieve?
[16:01:35] <thunder> when I was younger I used to be part of a ritual group, and two of the folks involved were heavily into mayan religious reconstructionism. but somehow it not only had escaped their notice entirely that there were around 8 million maya people still alive in south america at the time (many still practising their traditional way of life), but in spite of my having just attended a lecture with at a native elder's conference with an elderly traditional
[16:01:36] <thunder> mayan priest, they argued with me til I was blue in the face that maya culture died out centuries ago. derp!
[16:02:31] <thunder> they didn't get that impression from life experience, but from what they learned in school and read in books.
[16:02:54] <thunder> and they had read a lot of books, cuz they were into that subject
[16:03:00] <darsin> okay i see what you saying
[16:03:22] <darsin> are you sure this are maya people thunder
[16:03:55] <darsin> because when we talking totem culture

[16:05:02] <darsin> but simply per my observation into the matter
[16:05:15] <thunder> here's a documentary about the present day elected grand elder priest and time keeper of the maya of guatamala. he was commissioned by his people to put out this film around 2012 to help address misconceptions and histeria about their calendar. https://vimeo.com/108523617

[16:07:30] <darsin> okay let me check it out now to confirm if it's accessible
[16:08:14] <darsin> do why do people think the olmecs are no more here? thunder
[16:08:43] <darsin> i think you mistaking the native americans for the mayans
[16:09:41] <thunder> it's one of the earliest south american cultures to my knowledge. I haven't researched the subject in a long time, but I figure they never really went away, but simply became other people over generations as the political circumstances changed
[16:10:36] <darsin> no thunder
[16:10:39] <thunder> darsin: no. I certainly do not mistake native americans (which includes maya fyi) with mayans. same goes for aztecs too. today they call themselves the nahuat
[16:10:56] <darsin> okay
[16:11:15] <thunder> I've spoken with plenty of nahuat and maya people over the years to know for certain
[16:11:21] <darsin> so my question for you thunder is what happened to the mayans
[16:11:41] <thunder> their political system was wiped out by spaniards if I'm not mistaken
[16:11:47] <darsin> because you should also tie that to what happened to the egytians
[16:11:59] <thunder> at least the big public displays of empire
[16:12:28] <darsin> well i think spaniards came later into the equation
[16:12:59] <darsin> because there's a shift from giant structures to dwarf ones thunder

[16:21:43] <darsin> guns only work on people you can bamboozle
[16:21:54] <thunder> worshipping the sun and natural elements in a grand theatric way, doesn't trump people who devoted centuries to cultivating the most efficient ways to commit genocide
[16:22:23] <darsin> you realize that we still don't know really why someone would build such a massive structure, its still a wonder for this set of humanity
[16:23:00] <darsin> well you may have a point
[16:23:37] <darsin> and the question here is why would these people want genocide this much
[16:23:48] <thunder> as far as I'm aware they're ceremonial theatres. they had multiple functions back in the day, such as working like an urban center, royal palace, marketplace, sports stadium, etc. but mostly it was for religious ceremonies (not that they're separate from day-to-day life though)
[16:24:14] <thunder> speaking of the ones in south america
[16:24:31] <thunder> as to egypt ... not sure. probably exactly what the egyptians said their were, royal tombs
[16:24:40] <thunder> *they were
[16:25:58] <darsin> how about the size thunder, how did this people that had no machines do this? and other than had no machines, even if they did, what machines do you know right now that can make such a massive structure with that much weight
[16:26:05] <thunder> I know some people want them to be space ships or some kind of magic water fountain, or mystical healing something something. but personally, I'm okay with egyptologists and archeologist say so. I don't have a dog in the race, but that still seems the safest bet

[17:23:49] <thunder> if you go back each generation in your family and count how many ancestors were alive in that generation (assuming 30 years / generation) after 1000 years, you would have had 8 billion ancestors living concurrently. if you take the number of genes in the human genome (~40K) and consider that in each generation your descendants will receive 1/2 your genes, then after only 16 generations (~500 years) your descendants will no longer inherit genes from
[17:23:49] <thunder> you.

[17:24:40] <pussipupu> arryana: I might have meant "crank" but I guess we'll never know, maybe it was aliens
[17:25:51] <kmh> thunder,  seems a flawed argument
[17:26:01] <thunder> kmh: how so?
[17:26:42] <darsin> and where are we getting to with the gene transfer? why does my gene's subsistence matter
[17:27:16] <kmh> thunder,  a) genes are finite (meaning you cannot divide forever)  b) you ignore relations
[17:27:17] <thunder> of course there is more and more inbreeding the further back you go. and similarly a lot of genes you have will be shared among the population and potential ancestors to your progeny
[17:27:26] <kmh> consider cousins marrying
[17:27:52] * thunder nods
[17:28:24] <thunder> I'm just representing the math in isolation with actual population dynamics. it demonstrates how we're all related, and yet can't necessarily demonstrate it with a dna test
[17:28:31] <kmh> consider the y gene in a string of male offspring
[17:28:34] <thunder> isoation from
[17:29:53] <kmh> thunder, any DNA test proves relation
[17:30:27] <thunder> but after 16 generations statistically any rare unique genes which didn't provide significant survival advantage will have been weeded out of the gene pool
[17:30:34] <kmh> that is any dna test will show you're closer related to another human than to a chimp
[17:31:09] <thunder> okay. but that's at a species level. it also shows we share dna in common with plants and bacteria
[17:31:18] <kmh> yes
[17:31:48] <thunder> in fact about 5-8% is endogenous retroviruses
[17:31:59] <thunder> or our nda
[17:32:00] <kmh> i mean you probably can compute some distance measure

[20:10:09] <causative> to be meaningful, a claim must ultimately relate to the physical world
[20:10:30] <causative> when we speak of ideas, it must be with the understanding that they are patterns of neural activation
[20:11:31] <causative> when we speak of necessary truths, it must be with the understanding that it is a physical system that is performing these necessary deductions
[20:12:42] <causative> to ground a claim is to physically ground it

[20:15:59] <causative> for some claims, such as claims about qualia, it may not be apparent how the claim may be physically grounded, but the claim is still based in sensory experience that is hard to deny. These claims are provisionally meaningful - to grant them full meaning we would still need to ground them physically.
[20:16:11] <thunder> unless you're a neuroscientist (in which case you'd acknowledge the gaps in understanding) you can only take someone else's word for it. hence it's not grounded in physical reality
[20:17:07] <causative> you seem to have conflated "physical reality" with "direct experience"
[20:17:24] <causative> much of what we know about physical reality is not from our own direct experience
[20:17:51] <causative> we trust researchers who know more about it than we do, and who are part of a system of truth-seeking that has reliable mechanisms to weed out untruths
[20:19:26] <thunder> I also take much of that knowledge for granted as true. but that's a personal opinion. end of the day, I'm still just accepting hearsay.
[20:19:58] <thunder> until I get a neuroscience degree, it would be disingenuous of me to pretend I know for a fact
[20:20:28] <thunder> so, I have to reject the "must" and "necessary" conditions. I don't think they're valid
[20:21:20] <thunder> personally I find a first-person perspective of consciousness far more compelling because I can directly test the assertions without intermediation by authorities
[20:27:08] <thunder> causative: if you scroll up a ways I posted a link to Player001 about animal cognition, and it touches on some of the debate in neuroscience about this topic

[20:53:27] <causative> when you look around, it seems as if you are seeing a full picture, but your actual visual field is much smaller and grainier, with a blind spot in the middle and low quality around the edges
[20:53:31] <causative> your brain fills in the details

[20:56:32] <thunder> I think it's possible to have meaningful insights into how the mind works without reference to the brain. I'm in favour of the way cognitive science uses neurology as a way to study meditators, and then use that data to create eeg-style meditation apps (like the kind used to control prostheses).
[20:57:22] <thunder> that much I think is practical. but knowing a tonne about brain surgery, doesn't seem to have a lot of practical benefits outside a hospital or lab setting

It will help build your patience and understand a very crucial text in philosophy. You must go slow though and reserve judgment, or at least don't let any snap judgments of yours cloud your interpretation of the text.
