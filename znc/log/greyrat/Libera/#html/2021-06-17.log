[03:18:30] <rannnn8888> how i make its same results by herf or save the style ? https://dpaste.org/zRcD
[03:21:38] <entuland> rannnn8888, you got a reply about your query in #javascript already, and you asked just a few minutes ago
[03:21:59] <rannnn8888> yep i think its html ask
[03:23:24] <entuland> that looks more like a CSS question of sort
[03:23:31] <entuland> but hard to say since your context isn't enough
[03:23:40] <entuland> pick a channel and provide more data about your question
[03:29:10] <Visage> <a href="javascript:void();"> <- Please remove this nonsense.
[03:29:46] <Visage> But yeah, the quesiton isn't even remotely clear, and most likely not an HTML one; it just happens to involve HTML.

[16:12:33] <varaindemian> hi
[16:12:48] <varaindemian> I have this simple forms: https://pastebin.com/tdSskVvY
[16:13:23] <varaindemian> the text will contain a link
[16:13:53] <varaindemian> how can I take the link and execute this command: ./move.sh https://my-link-in-the-form.com GPU-0.DP-2
[17:02:59] <entuland> varaindemian, that's not something you can do with pure HTML, you need to use some server side code to invoke that command (whatever is within that shell script)
[17:03:24] <varaindemian> entuland using flask
[17:03:34] <entuland> still not fitting to #html
[17:03:42] <entuland> and probably not enough context
[17:03:44] <varaindemian> also, how can I put 3 forms top and 3 forms down
[17:04:04] <varaindemian> like an array 2x3
[17:04:35] <entuland> see if you can find a better fitting channel and provide enough context and data (you should also probably avoid using pastebin.com and provide a true live link or a fiddle instead, and you shouldn't use domain names you don't own, use example.com if you don't have one)
[17:05:12] <varaindemian> entuland alright, good to know!
[17:05:50] <entuland> there is a #python channel, that may fit better for your query
[17:06:11] <varaindemian> entuland thank you!
[17:06:14] <entuland> yw
[17:06:30] <varaindemian> entuland and regarding my 2x3 question?
[17:07:07] <entuland> you can arrange your markup and move it around as you see better fitting, but you should provide a fiddle so that we can see what you get there
[17:07:17] <entuland> pastebins can't be debugged or run
[17:07:29] <varaindemian> entuland where else can I paste?
[17:07:46] <entuland> jsfiddle.net or similar runners
[17:10:39] <varaindemian> entuland https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=yJNEJ9uiUI
[17:12:06] <entuland> don't use collaboration
[17:12:08] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/m702kLsr/
[17:12:43] <entuland> start by checking the grid layout of CSS and ask in #css if you need additional help about how to arrange your layout
[17:13:21] <entuland> fork that fiddle and start implementing the grid layout, then share the link with your attempt
[17:14:32] <varaindemian> so I can only do that with CSS?
[17:14:33] <entuland> as far as HTML go, make sure your markup is correct and don't use BR like that (you have a stray closing form tag there)
[17:14:42] <entuland> you could use a table but that would be a very bad idea
[17:14:51] <varaindemian> alright!
[17:14:58] <entuland> HTML is for structure and content, CSS for presentation / decoration
[17:16:41] <varaindemian> Good to know these!
[17:17:11] <entuland> yep, you can refer to this for the basics and additional documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
