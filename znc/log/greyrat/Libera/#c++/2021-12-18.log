[01:21:25] <RandomReader> in constructor form this looks like "conditional copy", which doesn't make sense for usage
[01:22:14] <RandomReader> it should either be a copy or not, and that should be obvious to the caller, or you wrap it in a function that does the same job

[01:29:54] <RandomReader> which we need in order to suggest solutions :P
[01:30:31] <rond_> Base have many different implementattions, but only "InheritsFromBase" is suitable for creating "A". However, I'd like to provide means to create A out of every type of Base. Hence the second ctor
[01:31:04] <rond_>  "InheritsFromBase" contains an optional field which is REQUIRED for creating A. So, if it's missing, then we need to recreate InheritsFromBase
[01:31:26] <rond_> does it make sense?
[01:32:04] <RandomReader> to put into a constructor? no
[01:32:23] <RandomReader> A createAFromBase(...)
[01:32:41] <rond_> I thought that ctor would be the most pleasent for users AND would adhere to RAII
[01:32:47] <RandomReader> do the logic there, call some A constructor with the actual params needed (which is clearly not InheritsFromBase)
[01:33:04] <RandomReader> there's nothing pleasant about this because it's wildly unclear what it does
[01:33:36] <RandomReader> what you have, conceptually, is something that might use one of any number of approaches to create A, because there's no direct conversion
[01:33:53] <RandomReader> and it's not even static information, it's entirely at runtime
[01:34:23] <RandomReader> this is the kind of thing that should be visible, so that the user understands something significant is happening here, if they ever have questions about the A they're getting

[01:35:00] <RandomReader> e.g. with this logic, A(inheritsfrombase) is inventing data and not taking it from that base
[01:35:24] <RandomReader> except when it doesn't and uses the data already there

[01:36:05] <rond_> because it might be not intuitive
[01:37:04] <rond_> but A(InheritsFromBase&) is the way to go in my opinion. The tricky thing is that InheritsFromBase has an optional field (that it can basically recreate - it's determinisitc; it's optional because users in some cases might not care about this field and would prefer to save memory)

[01:38:14] <rond_> hmmm, right

[01:38:34] <rond_> so A(InheritsFromBase&, ThisFieldThatWeVeBeenTalkingAbout&) is the way to go
[01:38:45] <rond_> because it doens't hide magic from the user
[01:38:49] <rond_> and is explicit
[01:38:55] <RandomReader> the technical challenge is in expressing that logic in a way that would allow you to directly initialize A members

[01:40:34] <rond_> but you can also do A((...) { prepare a lot of datastructures so A can be queried - following RAII }    because otherwise we end up with A().init() which is UGLY and errorprone

[01:41:16] <RandomReader> (you have to compromise on that in practice, but as a goal, that isn't it)
[01:41:33] <rond_> if A has members, that doesn't follow RAII, is my point - don;'t understand it

[01:53:11] <rond_> okay, that's some food for thought
[01:53:15] <RandomReader> so from this I would intuit that logically, A only needs data from f1 f2 and f3, which is exactly what the constructor would be, so it doesn't care about InheritedFromBase at all .. and that pushes me toward a separate factory/conversion kind of function that handles all that logic instead
[01:54:02] <rond_> I'll think about it, thanks!

I want to expose only the general function in a library because I don't see a point of notyfing user about the fact that there is a different implementation for `InheritsFromBase`.
[02:41:19] <rond_> However, when they call foo(InheritsFromBaseObj) I'd like an appropriate function to be called.
[02:41:47] <rond_> or do I need to include both in .hpp?

[06:58:34] <Alipha> shugo: nothing happened to the int* when you cast it to char*. The int* and char* both hold the same address. It's just that cout has logic to print the characters at the char* address instead of printing the address itself, like it does with other pointer types. Above, cout prints "hello" instead of the address held by p
