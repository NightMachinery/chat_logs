[16:25:12] <Robomot> Why is ML software so horrible? : learnmachinelearning
[16:25:36] <PapuaHardyNet> this is a high quality rant about the state of ML framework + GPU in 2019
[16:31:16] <RiversHaveWings> I've tried just pip installing tensorflow-gpu. But that doesn't work because it blindly assumes I have exactly cuda 10.0 installed, but on my system it's already cuda 10.1. WHY ISN'T THAT COMPATIBLE??!?
[16:31:41] <RiversHaveWings> ...Why doesn't it work actually, PyTorch precompiled binaries on pypi work with any later version of CUDA
[16:31:50] <feep[work]> semantic versioning is a lie presumably
[16:33:22] <feep[work]> augh I really want the sentence "semantic versioning is a jewish conspiracy" to exist on the internet, but also I don't want to google it in case google thinks I am Interested In That Kind Of Content
[16:33:30] <RiversHaveWings> "Come over to Caffe. Let the fuckery explode to demonic levels." ahah
[16:33:46] <RiversHaveWings> I used to regularly have to edit the Caffe Makefile
[16:33:54] <feep[work]> that's bad.
[16:33:58] <RiversHaveWings> Not just the config, the actual Makefile
[16:34:09] <feep[work]> at least you didn't have to edit the autotools config
[16:34:09] <RiversHaveWings> The config by itself is complex
[16:34:19] <feep[work]> still one step down from Real Hell
[16:34:48] <RiversHaveWings> caffe has a cmake too but it usually doesn't work
[16:34:58] <feep[work]> ci optional or nonexistent?
[16:35:03] <RiversHaveWings> Or it finds the wrong Python install
[16:35:11] <feep[work]> also fun
[16:35:11] <RiversHaveWings> Like system Python 2
[16:35:21] <RiversHaveWings> When I need to build it against 3
[16:35:47] <feep[work]> I know that feel .. "I'm sure there's some configure parameter to fix this. ... fuck it, $ edit Makefile"
[16:35:52] <RiversHaveWings> (When I last used it it was still Python 2 by default, edit the make config for Python 3)
[16:36:05] <RiversHaveWings> Also. Caffe uses boost and boost-python
[16:36:11] <RiversHaveWings> Which is its own hell
[16:36:14] <feep[work]> .. boost-python?
[16:36:16] <feep[work]> do I want to know?
[16:36:22] <RiversHaveWings> Boost.Python
[16:36:34] <feep[work]> I mean, why would you
[16:36:42] <feep[work]> like, isn't boost the special c++ magic thing
[16:36:44] <RiversHaveWings> Yes
[16:36:53] *** Quits: milanandreew (uid500468@user/milanandreew) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[16:36:53] <feep[work]> why would you bring that into a dynamic language that gets half of it built in
[16:37:11] <RiversHaveWings> It's a Boost/Python interop library, it uses it so you can call the C++ stuff from Python mostly
[16:37:27] <RiversHaveWings> Since no one actually wants to write C++.
[16:37:29] <feep[work]> oh, it's like a ... boost addon for python integration
[16:37:32] <RiversHaveWings> If they can avoid it
[16:37:36] <RiversHaveWings> Yes
[16:37:41] <feep[work]> I thought it was a *boost binding* for python
[16:37:46] <RiversHaveWings> Ahah
[16:37:57] <feep[work]> already the world looks not quite so terrible :)
[16:38:29] <RiversHaveWings> It does stuff like C++ to Python exception translation even
[16:38:40] <feep[work]> okay seems reasonable
[16:38:57] <RiversHaveWings> You can also write custom Caffe layers in Python and call them from the C++ side lol
[16:39:15] <RiversHaveWings> I never did that
[16:39:31] <RiversHaveWings> But the interop goes both ways
[16:40:08] <RiversHaveWings> (The reason is if you need something custom for training and you are using the C++ CLI training tool)
[16:40:29] <RiversHaveWings> (It won't run on GPU and will generally be kind of slow, you're expected to implement it in numpy or smth)
[16:40:38] <nshepperd2> sounds like a nightmare
[16:40:44] <RiversHaveWings> yep
[16:40:59] <RiversHaveWings> So it's never actually able to find the system Boost.Python without editing the makefile config
[16:41:01] *** Quits: lucerne (~lucerne@ip202.ip-51-178-215.eu) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:41:49] <RiversHaveWings> Also Boost.Python is usually built against, like, a specific Python binary or, failing that, a specific Python version
[16:42:09] <RiversHaveWings> And some random Python you got from somewhere won't have it.
[16:42:22] <RiversHaveWings> The usual advice is "use Anaconda"
[16:42:52] <RiversHaveWings> But system Python generally has a corresponding Boost.Python package somewhere in the repo and so does Homebrew's Python
[16:43:06] *** Joins: lucerne (~lucerne@ip202.ip-51-178-215.eu)
[16:43:56] <RiversHaveWings> Also it didn't autodetect which GPU hardware revisions to build CUDA kernels for and if you had a newer GPU you had to edit the makefile config manually again
[16:44:08] <nshepperd2> sometimes if you just symlink cuda 10.0 to 10.1 it works
[16:44:37] <RiversHaveWings> But usually IME the major headaches were building against a specific Python 3 and Boost.Python.
[16:46:07] <RiversHaveWings> Oh, if you ever touched the Python binary or the Boost.Python binary, like upgrading to a newer point release, you'd have to rebuild and hope it worked again
[16:47:02] <feep[work]> isn't this what docker is for
[16:47:19] <RiversHaveWings> Yes, I eventually ended up making a Docker image
[16:47:34] <nshepperd2> boy am i glad someone wrote tensorboardX, so i can log stuff to tensorboard without getting dumb "your libproto is $version, it should be $two_years_old_version" errors
[16:47:37] <RiversHaveWings> It is years out of date now but Caffe has been abandoned for years and the Docker still works.
[16:47:40] <RiversHaveWings> OH RIGHT
[16:47:44] <RiversHaveWings> Caffe uses protobufs!
[16:47:58] <nshepperd2> fuck protobufs
[16:48:00] <RiversHaveWings> So it's libprotobuf hell time too
[16:48:24] <RiversHaveWings> (And, usually, the problem was with the Python protobuf interface)
[16:48:35] *** Joins: milanandreew (uid500468@user/milanandreew)
[16:48:50] <feep[work]> this is why everyone just uses json
[16:49:08] * nshepperd2 waves in the general direction of cbor
[16:49:13] <RiversHaveWings> It had to serialize the weights
[16:49:47] <feep[work]> json.dumps all the things
[16:49:49] <RiversHaveWings> no
[16:49:53] <feep[work]> ALL.
[16:50:11] <feep[work]> even floats. especially floats!!
[16:50:19] <RiversHaveWings> Some Caffe models are like 500MB of float32s
[16:50:30] <feep[work]> eh, disk is cheap
[16:50:32] <nshepperd2> no, cbor2.dumps all the things
[16:50:51] <feep[work]> that's like 3GB of raw, maybe throw a gz on it
[16:51:11] <feep[work]> hm let me test how well an array of floats compresses
[16:51:38] <RiversHaveWings> OK but how long would it take to load all of those floats
[16:51:42] <feep[work]> let me. test.
[16:52:31] <feep[work]> let me. test.
[16:52:33] <feep[work]> er
[16:52:38] <nshepperd2> loading 3GB of floats from cbor takes long enough lol
[16:52:40] <RiversHaveWings> so VGG-19 is 143667240 float32s
[16:53:04] <feep[work]> like 100M?
[16:53:06] <feep[work]> of floats
[16:53:32] <nshepperd2> that's 500MB
[16:53:44] <RiversHaveWings> Oh right, if you're training you need to include optimizer states, which are usually like 2x the size of the model, so 3x that.
[16:54:05] <feep[work]> oh wow yeah json.dumps is *not* optimized lol.
[16:54:08] <RiversHaveWings> ahah
[16:54:36] <feep[work]> 10M floats goes p fast
[16:54:36] <RiversHaveWings> pytorch uses a custom format that stores pickles and weight arrays in a zip or smth
[16:54:41] <RiversHaveWings> Some other stuff uses HDF5
[16:54:58] <feep[work]> that ends up as ~200MB of json
[16:55:01] <feep[work]> 191MB
[16:55:34] <feep[work]> gzip: 90MB, hm I was hoping for more
[16:56:17] <feep[work]> bzip2: 76MB, ~7.6 bytes per float
[16:57:17] <feep[work]> okay, loading 10M floats back only takes 3s
[16:57:32] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: so extrapolating blindly I guess 30s to load 100MB of floats from json
[16:57:36] <feep[work]> er, 100M floats*
[16:57:48] <feep[work]> like wow, python json is *not* very optimized.
[16:58:24] <feep[work]> maybe ijson is better?
[17:00:15] <feep[work]> not gonna try tho ^^

[20:17:08] <feep> hey btw
[20:17:17] <feep> I worked out a neat data structure at work and I'm wondering if it has a name
[20:17:52] <feep> the idea is, you need to control access to like ... say, 10k table rows
[20:17:59] <feep> and you don't really feel like allocating a mutex per row
[20:18:10] <feep> and your language doesn't support futexes
[20:18:13] <feep> so
[20:18:42] <feep> what you do is, you keep an internal table of "Mutex, pending, key"
[20:19:04] <feep> and to lock a key, you loop through the table looking for an existing entry, if you find one you grab the mutex, increment pending and call lock
[20:19:38] <feep> if you don't find an entry, you look for an *empty* entry (pending=0) instead, set its key to the key, count pending up to 1, and lock
[20:19:46] <feep> if you don't find an empty entry, you grow the table
[20:19:52] <mst> sounds like a pre-allocated pool of mutexes
[20:19:55] <feep> right exactly
[20:20:02] <mst> not sure if there's a specific name for such a thing beyond that

[20:21:30] <mst> feep: oh, yes, it makes complete sense, but it still seems like mostly being a pool
[20:21:31] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[20:21:48] <mst> feep: like, allocating a mutex on-demand every time rather than keeping the ones you'd used previously would be the dumb version of the pattern
[20:21:57] <feep> mst: right
[20:21:58] <mst> at which point you'd just have a hash table of mutexes indexed by key
[20:22:09] <feep> I admit I was tempted to do it that way just for easy
[20:22:29] <feep> and I kinda went through a few contortions with the table before I collapsed into that super simple pattern
[20:22:37] <mst> so it seems to me that what you've done is basically implemented three simpler patterns together and the end result probably doesn't have its own name even though it's still a neat design in the end
