[02:35:58] <phoe> is there a portable way to get a type specifier that matches only something of type X and not its subtypes?
[02:36:11] <phoe> something equivalent to EQ CLASS-OF if we were talking classes instead
[02:36:40] <phoe> if BAR inherits from FOO, I'd like something that is (AND FOO (NOT BAR)), except obviously I cannot enumerate all subtypes in the NOT because new ones can be created at any time
[02:37:19] <_death> satisfies

[02:46:29] <phoe> and thinking what exactly I want to achieve
[02:47:02] <_death> I see
[02:49:43] <Bike> i don't understand what exactly this would mean except in relation to classes
[02:50:18] <phoe> yes, I'm still thinking
[02:58:01] *** Quits: gaqwas (~john@dynamic-077-002-028-240.77.2.pool.telefonica.de) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:01:31] <pjb> phoe: subtypes are usually subsets.
[03:01:41] <phoe> yes, I was talking garbage, don't mind me
[03:02:21] <pjb> the only case is when you can't insert a type between tyep type and NIL. eg (subtypep 'nil '(integer 42 42)) #| --> t ; t |#
[03:02:44] <pjb> For classes, that would be meaningful indeed.
[03:02:45] <moon-child> pjb: types are not sets.  Your broader point applies however
[03:02:49] <pjb> = direct-instances
[03:03:02] <pjb> moon-child: more or less, yes.
[03:13:39] <_death> what are types if not sets?
[03:14:08] <moon-child> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence
[03:15:11] <_death> seems like an equivocation
[03:15:29] <phoe> I mean, that's a long article
[03:15:32] <phoe> is there a tl;dr?
[03:15:44] <_death> in Common Lisp, types are sets
[03:16:24] <moon-child> actually, since in common lisp types can be defined according to arbitrary predicates
[03:16:35] <Bike> yeah, common lisp types wouldn't work for curry howard so well. they define a naive set theory.
[03:16:35] <moon-child> types are classes
[03:16:46] <moon-child> :^)
[03:16:48] <phoe> more like the other way around
[03:16:57] <phoe> KEYWORD is not a class even though I wish it was
[03:17:09] <_death> I guess you mean "class" in the set theory sense
[03:17:12] <moon-child> phoe: I mean, lisp-level types are maths-level classes
[03:17:13] <Bike> also, the standard literally defines types to be sets within the context of the language, just to make it clear
[03:17:14] <phoe> oh!
[03:17:14] <moon-child> _death: yeah
[03:17:16] *** Quits: recordgroovy (~recordgro@c-67-185-152-122.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[03:17:17] <phoe> welp
[03:17:36] <_death> but they are sets (which are classes)
[03:18:16] <Bike> yeah, naive set theory. so things like "barbers that shave only those who do not shave themselves" are sets
[03:18:42] <Bike> (satisfies barber-who-shaves-only-those-who-do-not-shave-themselves-p)
[03:20:13] <_death> you need to provide the definition of this predicate :)
[03:20:15] <phoe> how would you even properly express that in a CL type system
[03:21:37] <_death> types are not first class objects in Common Lisp
[03:21:45] <Bike> (defun type-that-contains-itself-p (type-specifier) (typep type-specifier type-specifier)) (satisfies type-that-contains-itself-p)
[03:21:58] <Bike> for the actual paradox throw some nots in there
[03:22:33] <Bike> and then marvel as a math thing from a hundred and twenty years ago leads to the practical consequence of needing to restart your lisp
[03:22:46] <phoe> :(
[03:23:18] *** Joins: cjb (~cjb@user/cjb)
[03:24:47] <Bike> e.g., (typep 'cons '(satisfies type-doesnt-contain-itself-p)) => T, (typep '(cons t) ...) => NIL, (typep '(satisfies type-doesnt-contain-itself-p) '(satisfies type-doesnt-contain-itself-p)) => hang
[03:25:07] <Bike> or just a stack overflow i guess. forgot about those
[03:25:28] <aeth> SATISFIES is cheating, though
[03:25:35] <aeth> since you can just do (loop)
[03:25:40] <phoe> typep should be able to return (VALUES NIL NIL)
[03:25:45] <moon-child> Bike: yeah, lots of things are easy to express mathematically but not so much in code
[03:25:50] <Bike> i'm not talking about how to hang the type system, i'm talking about how types are sets.
[03:25:50] <moon-child> see also: y combinator, in eager languages
[03:25:58] <Bike> it's easy to express in code! the result just sucks is all
[03:26:41] <aeth> hmm, apparently SBCL doesn't like me using FLET with a satisfies type
[03:26:50] <Bike> satisfies is literally unrestricted comprehension. the lisp type system is set theory pre-russell.
[03:26:59] <Bike> satisfies only works with global function names.
[03:27:13] <aeth> (defun loop* (x) (declare (ignore x)) (loop)) (typep 42 '(satisfies loop*))
[03:27:20] <_death> Bike: well, wasn't Russell's solution to introduce multiple levels (meta)
[03:27:32] <phoe> is there any strictly technological reason why it cannot accept function objects?
[03:27:42] <phoe> like `(satisfies ,(lambda (x) (oddp x))
[03:27:44] <aeth> for all I know, other implementations do
[03:27:46] <Bike> wasn't levels quine? or was everyone doing that?
[03:28:06] <Bike> an implementation accepting a function would be nonconforming, and i don't think any of them do
[03:28:11] <Bike> i don't think there's a technological reason though.
[03:28:13] <phoe> yes, I know
[03:28:14] <_death> think everyone was doing that, but not in that context
[03:28:23] <phoe> just a question for the Hypothetical Future Revision™
[03:28:36] <_death> I especially liked Tarski :)
[03:28:46] <Bike> well tarski is the coolest logician.
[03:28:47] <phoe> since type specifiers can already be unreadable, adding a function object in there won't break anything
[03:28:56] <Bike> or was, i guess he's dead probably.
[03:30:27] *** Joins: aidenw (~Aiden@156.57.146.89)
[03:30:46] <_death> so the thing is, types are not first class objects.. you can only refer to them via type specifiers
[03:30:58] <Bike> more seriously i think any HFT of types would warrant some thought about what types are actually for. i thought about it once and came up with four uses pulling them in different directions, though i don't remember the fourth now
[03:42:15] <aeth> four?
[03:42:31] <aeth> I can think of only two: types-for-verification and types-for-performance-hints.
[03:42:41] <aeth> verification as in precondition/postcondition
[03:49:26] <Bike> types are a predication DSL, used to describe constraints to the compiler for optimization, and used to describe storage classes for arrays and structures and stuff.

[06:11:00] <pjb> phoe: note that deftype is like defmacro.  If you allow closures in satisfies, each time the type is expanded you get a different closure!
[06:11:32] <pjb> phoe: AFAICS, this is the reason why we're restricted to functions (that have to be defined in the compilation environment too, most of the time, so eval-when).
[06:14:13] <pjb> phoe: but granted, it makes it very difficult to define list-of (deftype list-of (element-type) `(satisfies ,(once-or-twice (eval `(defun ,(gensym) (object) (is-proper-list-of ,',element-type object)))))) etc…
[06:14:39] <pjb> in the current spec, you need to define a toplevel function for each type of list-of lists.
[06:16:39] <pjb> phoe: perhaps like this: (deftype list-of (element-type) (let ((predicate (lambda (object) (typep object element-type)))) `(satisfies ,(compile (gensym) predicate))))
[06:17:00] <pjb> I mean: (deftype list-of (element-type) (let ((predicate (lambda (object) (is-proper-list-of object element-type)))) `(satisfies ,(compile (gensym) predicate))))
[06:18:22] <pjb> Yes, that works, with eg. (defun is-proper-list-of (object element-type) (and (proper-list-p object) (every (lambda (element) (typep element element-type)) object)))
[06:19:36] *** Joins: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts)
[06:20:57] <pjb> But as I said, this generates a new closure and a new toplevel function for each occurences of (list-of foo) (list-of foo) (list-of foo) ->  3 equal closures, 3 toplevel functions. So you want to manage a cache, which has the misfortune of having to live across the compilation-environment and the runtime environment. ie. you need to rebuild the cache at load-time or execute…
[06:21:55] <pjb> satisfies would have to do the same without necessarily knowing what keys to use for the cache, if it had to deal with closures itself. at least, when the user does it, he knows what he's doing…

[14:13:40] <lisp123_> would it be possible to implement a reverse proxy through hunchentoot?
[14:14:36] <flip214> lisp123_: of course.
[14:14:47] <flip214> you can use drakma to make outgoing HTTP connections.
[14:15:04] <lisp123_> flip214: then that would be the answer to the earlier query on how to reverse proxy in CL
[14:15:36] <lisp123_> thanks for confirming
[14:15:50] <flip214> unless there is some specific rewriting to do, I'd go for a standard product, though (nginx, apache, haproxy, etc.). even casual text changes (via regexes) can be done in apache, for example.
[14:16:19] <lisp123_> yeah nginx is a very easy to use reverse proxy imo (well since I know how to use it, hence its easy to use :D)
[14:21:05] <flip214> lisp123_: depending on the answer time of the http services "behind" the proxy you might have quite a lot of simultaneous active http connections.
[14:21:43] <flip214> HT by default creates threads; quux-ht uses a thread pool; perhaps you should take a look at tpd2 or so, to have a bounded number of threads for an (more or less) unbounded number of connections.

[21:45:52] <Shinmera> First fo all, that's being very dismissive of all the work that had to be done, and second the reason is because apple wants you to distribute stuff solely through the app store and makes everything else a huge pain in the ass to force your hand.

[22:15:48] <jeosol> calling out threading experts, my code exhibiting weird behavior and I don't throwing locks here and there is the way to do it. I am using bordeaux threads for simd-like tasks. I have 3 tasks A, B, C that I would like to run in parallel: A writes files required for step B, B does a system call using the file from step A and 3rd party exe, and C
[22:15:48] <jeosol> reads the output of step B.
[22:16:52] <jeosol> For step A, I occassionally, get the inputs jumbled when I look at the files for different cases, e.g., a file for a different task ends up being included for a different task.
[22:17:15] <Bike> i don't understand that last clause
[22:17:26] <jeosol> I would like to chain all three steps A, B, C, but perhaps doing A serially, B parallel, C serially is more tractable
[22:17:38] <jeosol> Bike: apologies
[22:18:22] <Josh_2> Instead of a lock you could use semaphores to signal when B when A is done, and C when B is done
[22:18:32] <Josh_2> signal B when A *

[22:20:32] <jeosol> Bike: It is a population-based optimization I am doing and I need to evaluate F(X) for several iterations and populations. Step B is the most expensive and can run for hours, I have created a small case that finishes in 2 seconds for my testing. steps A and C are very fast and not the bottle neck
[22:21:33] <jeosol> issue is when writing the files, some of the indices are jumbled. For instance in a given iteration, say iteration 1, I can have 20 solutions. so I append the iteration index and population index to the ends of files in each folder. e.g., input_iter1_sol2.dat
[22:21:49] <shka> Shinmera: i grabbed two for 15 bucks each, it also looks like something i could appreciate on aesthetically

[22:22:21] <Josh_2> jeosol: http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~kishore/papers/semaphores.pdf maybe you would find the pattern in section 3.5 useful
[22:22:34] <jeosol> All relevant files in the same folder should have same iteration and solution indices: e.g., <prefix file>_iter1_sol2.dat
[22:22:52] <jeosol> Josh_2: thanks, I will take a look
[22:23:26] <jeosol> So far, I have used locks, but it stinks and works in some cases and other it doesn't. However in serial mode, everything is kosher
[22:23:36] <Bike> i'm sorry, you're giving a very high level description of your system but it's hard to understand the particular problem. is it something like, a file produced by an A task is being processed by the wrong kind of B task?
[22:26:19] <Josh_2> does sound to me like you need semaphores, you can use them to pause and synchronize the execution of the tasks. if B depends on the completion of A, then B can sit on its semaphore until A signals it, then B will execute, same for B and C
[22:26:34] <jeosol> Bike: I didn't want to get into too much details. I wanted to understand any CL aspects in case I am missing something. In the above only step A is critical, as if the wrong files ended up in the wrong folder, the application will file as it can't get the folder so I say objective function is some high value 1e10 (for minimization task)
[22:27:03] <Bike> i would guess that there's nothing CL-specific to worry about
[22:27:06] <jeosol> I want to be able to do a call, e.g., like (call-with-thread-lock (function-A) ...) or something similar so the file writing steps is correct
[22:27:20] <jeosol> Bike: That's my guess too

[22:29:58] <Bike> i think you are confused about what with-lock-held does?
[22:30:14] <Bike> when you exit the with-lock-held form, the lock is released. your release-lock call is redundant and probably an error or something.

[22:31:30] <Bike> it will evaluate the cleanup form once unconditionally, and then again if it returns true
[22:31:58] <Bike> you probably meant to check whether there's a cleanup form at macroexpansion time rather than runtime
[22:32:31] <jeosol> Bike: yeah, mixed up compile- and runtime here .. you are right

[22:32:58] <Bike> ,@(when cleanup-form (list cleanup-form)) is what you want i think?
[22:33:47] <Bike> just to be very clear about with-lock-held - the lock will be released if the form is exited in any way. it essentially does an unwind-protect to ensure it's released.
[22:34:30] <jeosol> so my unwind-protect on top is reduntant since the with-lock-held would have released the lock on exit
[22:34:31] <jeosol> ?
[22:35:38] <jeosol> I guess I can simplify things, I rarely have a cleanup form, or just chain all tasks together
[22:35:58] <phantomics> Guest82: better to choose React, from what I heard Angular has been abandoned
[22:36:52] <Bike> you could dispense with this macro, and instead just do (unwind-protect (with-lock-held ...) cleanup) when you need to

[22:53:55] <jeosol> shka: thanks for the link
[22:54:04] <shka> you are welcome
[22:54:31] <shka> so when you call lparallel:pmapcar, you will get list of results, just like with mapcar
[22:54:49] <shka> and it will block until everything is completed
[22:54:55] <shka> but it will complete in parallel
[22:54:59] <shka> which is what you want
[22:55:06] <shka> (i think, at least)
[22:56:52] <jeosol> yeah its similar to what I am doing, but I can't say I am using lparallel. My issue is the shear size of parameters - unfortunately, I have functions all over the place. So I was wondering if I could somehow tie them together and use the lock, everything will be kosher
[22:57:13] <jeosol> but I will look into other options, like you suggested.
[22:57:45] <jeosol> it seems it will do that I want especially with the blocking part but still running in parallel
[22:58:30] <shka> jeosol: also check lparallel:plet
[22:58:41] <Josh_2> Best not use locks if you are going to be blocking for a long time
[22:58:49] <Josh_2> because they spin (I believe) and so they take up CPU
[23:00:07] <jeosol> I was only using it for those Task A writing files that don't take much time, but for B, no locking, until I get to C again to read out. The task B - more expensive part, has no locking
[23:00:33] <jeosol> But a cleaner solution that allows me to just chain everything and not worry, if at all, is better.
[23:01:04] <shka> jeosol: well, you can use lparallel:future and lparallel:chain
[23:01:35] <Bike> Josh_2: only a really dumb lock implementation actually just spins. they try to yield the processor.
[23:01:52] <jeosol> several months ago, some I chatted with on linked advised to look at lparallel but since bt-threads was working, I never saw the need. I guess I have to look into it now
[23:02:01] <shka> most spin loccks usually have a maximum spin count
[23:02:17] <Bike> lparallel is a library on top of bordeaux. higher level, if you like
[23:02:34] <Bike> bordeaux mostly just provides primitives like threads and locks and stuff.
[23:02:37] <jeosol> @Bike
[23:02:46] <_death> jeosol: maybe you can arrange it so that you have a function (defun my-task (number) (read-outputs (magic (write-inputs number)))) .. then pmapcar it as shka suggested
[23:02:50] <shka> i use lparallel almost everyday, it saved me countless hours of programming and debugging
[23:03:10] <jeosol> ok, I was low level, writing my joins, etc. May be I need to stay higher-level since there are aspects I may not understand very well
[23:04:28] <jeosol> _death: I see. That's would be much cleaner - so at the level of calling my-task function, the locking (?) and blocking is taken care of?
[23:05:01] *** Quits: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:05:12] <Bike> well if each indexed task can be handled independently you shouldn't really need to lock anything
[23:05:29] <jeosol> shka: I think I should do same, move to lparallel. I debugged yesterday and was able to isolate the issue to the parallelization as serial model gives the correct results and I noticed the jumbled input files
[23:06:05] <jeosol> Bike: There are some shared resources (CLOS objects) - this may be where the issues are
[23:06:20] <shka> jeosol: not if those are read-only
[23:06:50] <_death> jeosol: there's no need for locking if the inputs and outputs are written in separate files, and magic only depends on the inputs.. a naive approach would be to have start a thread for each task and just join them all.. lparallel allows you to limit the number of tasks running at once
[23:07:15] <jeosol> shka: good point, unfortunately, not all the way through, for instance, I am taking some parameters from a higher level object and saving them in a lower object (iteration and solution indices) - i noticed an issue there
[23:08:50] <jeosol> _death: ok I see, I am doing something similar but have a loop with bt-threads functionality to track the join, specify a batch-job parameter and all. But I should probably just be using a library if it will save me all the headache
[23:09:19] <_death> jeosol: right, often threads are too low level an abstraction
[23:09:33] <jeosol> ultimately, my goal is to do distributed computing, but I have only used swank-crew to run on another box, for one of computation and it's ok so far
[23:09:49] <jeosol> _death: I agree with you completel
[23:11:29] <_death> there is also an lparallel for multiple machines, called lfarm.. I've no experience with it though
[23:13:19] <jeosol> oh really. that'd be interesting - I checked aws but they were expensive. Someone here referred me to some European option. The plan will be to have some machines with the executable  for task B installed, and SBCL running, route the jobs, and get the results back
[23:13:54] <jeosol> I am far from that point, but I will look into lfarm

[23:20:17] <jeosol> shka: haha, I think they are dirty enough, lol, I used to use pthreads with C++ code - not an easy experience
[23:20:57] <shka> C++ has support for threads in the standard since C++11

[23:21:13] <jeosol> skha: I handle the thread batching via loops and joining, but I should probably just offload that task and not have to worry much. Yeah, the locks have helped but I should probably redesign to avoid setting variables in thread calls
[23:21:39] <shka> well, good luck
[23:21:48] <jeosol> shka: My C/C++ days was back in graduate schools, I have not coded C/C++ since leaving,  like 2010
[23:22:30] <jeosol> shka: thanks. I have a deadline for a conference, and need to have this parallelization part to work to be able to submit the runs

[23:23:19] <shka> my tip: try to rewrite your main part so it is run in a function passed to the mapcar

[23:23:38] <shka> and try removing synchronization points if possible
[23:23:50] <shka> and then move to lparallel
[23:24:35] <shka> the fun part with lparallel is that you can write (apply (if parallelp #'lparallel:pmap #'cl:map) nil function input-sequence)
[23:24:53] <shka> well, s/apply/funcall
[23:25:28] <shka> which allows you to use the exact same source code for both parallel and serial execution

[23:30:33] <jeosol> skha: good point: The ability to use the same code for serial and parallel is definitely import. For now, I have a use-parallel-p variable that I use to test both parts. Serial part is trival because I have a loop that calls a function withich chains all the steps I need
[23:31:33] <jeosol> shka: I definitely need to make my life easier when i comes to executing parallel jobs, so I should consider alternatives

[23:33:39] <jeosol> shka: by "removing synchronization points ..." you mean avoid writing to shared resource?
[23:33:47] <shka> yes
[23:34:20] <shka> use the return value instead
[23:34:33] <jeosol> shka: I agree. I think I will spend some time to redesign so as not to worry about this again
[23:34:35] <shka> much less potential for bugs
[23:35:11] <shka> yeah, try to refactor code into sort of map reduce code
[23:35:11] <jeosol> I have a part were are save some variables in an object they get jumbled some pointing to previous indices.
[23:35:37] <jeosol> shka: I agree - options less prone to bugs
[23:36:01] <shka> and if that does not work, you can use lparallel:future and chain which allows you to link execution steps
[23:36:24] <shka> but what you are doing sounds more like a map reduce type of problem

[23:39:16] <jeosol> shka: the call to F(X) is from an upstream higher level algorithm (optimizer) with F(X_i) doing F(A(X_i)), F(B(X_i)), and F(C(X_i)) - so having the main F(X_i) execute without the issues is better. The higher-level algorithm doesn't know about the CLOS object used to compute F(X_i)
[23:39:17] <shka> jeosol: real world example https://github.com/sirherrbatka/clusters/blob/a0c565a95d66ba025277fca41ec3b3e4c05b1226/source/k-means/utils.lisp#L67
[23:39:54] <shka> clusters.utils:pmap calls either cl:map or lparallel:pmap depending on the first argument
[23:40:27] <jeosol> shka: thanks for that example - it should help greatly
[23:41:47] <shka> https://github.com/sirherrbatka/clusters/blob/a0c565a95d66ba025277fca41ec3b3e4c05b1226/source/common/methods.lisp#L85 perhaps something more interesting
[23:42:22] <jeosol> noticed compiler type instructures "the" and other declare statements -- what is the speed up with and without, I know it probably depends
[23:42:36] <shka> anyway, gotta call it a day
[23:43:02] <shka> jeosol: it is ONLY useful for numeric types
[23:43:16] <jeosol> thanks shka:
[23:43:23] <shka> and even then, not really that much
[23:43:56] <jeosol> my neural network library on mnist is very slow (type hints or anything) haha
[23:43:57] <shka> well, i guess perhaps for arrays as well, since maybe compiler will be able to inline memory access
[23:44:26] <jeosol> my matrix-vector operations are not optimized and used loops, etc. it was just to check my understanding
[23:44:27] <shka> sbcl is not really that great target for neural networks
[23:44:54] <jeosol> oh really?
[23:45:17] <jeosol> I thought for number crunching it's supposed to be best of the free ones
[23:45:24] <shka> it is!
[23:45:33] <jeosol> anyway, I won't take your time, we can pick up later
[23:46:02] <shka> just let me show you one main problem
[23:46:46] <jeosol> I normally do computational tasks but for my task B (numerical modeling part) I just use a 3rd party executable. It will take lots of efforts to write a 3D numerical solver and then worry about matrix conditions, optimize computations, etc. The 3rd party exe was written in Fortran
[23:51:46] <shka> jeosol: check the following (disassemble (lambda (a b) (declare (type double-float a b) (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0))) (* a b)))
[23:53:12] <Inline> so what does it get you to write the last one as (* (the double-float a) (the double-float b)) ?
[23:53:23] <Inline> you spare the type checking ?
[23:53:25] <shka> sorry, i meant
[23:53:32] <shka> jeosol: check the following (disassemble (lambda (a b) (declare (type single-float a b) (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0))) (* a b)))
[23:54:20] <shka> Inline: in this case those type assertions are redundant
[23:54:29] <shka> well, not assertions
[23:54:31] <shka> type hints
[23:54:38] <Inline> ah yes
[23:55:40] <Inline> so useful if you didn't declare beforehand but only hinted at
[23:55:56] <jeosol> shka: yeah, i ran in, I am supposed to notice something ...
[23:56:24] <shka> uh
[23:56:38] <shka> it used to be slightly more wonky then it is right now
[23:56:56] <jeosol> Oh I see, I didn't get what I should have noticed
[23:57:43] <shka> uh, am i crazy...
[23:58:03] <jeosol> Some neural network training on my desk top didn't finish after several days, other guy said it ran cuda arrays on gpu, in 24 hours - that's a massive speed up
[23:58:17] <jeosol> If i get some spare change next, I will look to invest in one of those machines
[23:58:22] <jeosol> btw, this is running SBCL
[23:58:48] <shka> jeosol: disregard what i said, i confused single-float < with multiplication
[23:59:11] <jeosol> shka: not crazy, I am not  compiler guy ...
[23:59:34] <Bike> that multiplication is going to have to cons if in an independent function like that
[23:59:50] <Bike> since double floats are usually boxed
