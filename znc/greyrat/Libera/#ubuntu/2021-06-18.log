[00:44:27] <hepku> Yeah, it is a vm created by minikube, a kubernetes based local cluster orchestrator.
[00:44:29] <hepku> This is what the docs say about the guest vm: The minikube ISO is booted by each hypervisor to provide a stable minimal Linux environment to start Kubernetes from. It is based on coreboot, uses systemd, and includes all necessary container runtimes and hypervisor guest drivers.

[00:44:59] <oerheks> oh, important information
[00:45:01] <oerheks> kubernetes
[00:45:12] <hepku> tomreyn So I guess that the problem is the ISO does not get built with the kernel module I want?

[00:46:03] <tomreyn> hepku: "The minikube ISO" ... "It is based on coreboot" -> this is where you should seek support
[00:46:19] <hepku> But after I did that and used that ISO instead, once I ssh into minikube vm, it still does not have the modules.
[00:46:22] <sarnold> hepku: what problem exactly are you trying to solve?
[00:46:38] <tomreyn> this channel supports Ubuntu, and its packages, not the vatrious guest systems you could run on it

[00:51:18] <hepku> In general, could I simply download the .ko file and copy that over to the VM?
[00:51:27] <sarnold> hepku: and normally ipv4 is compiled into the kernel; tbh I'm not sure if you can even turn off ipv4..
[00:51:50] <hepku> So the VM has some ipv4 modules
[00:51:52] <sarnold> hepku: kernel modules need to match the kernel they were built for exactly
[00:51:53] <hepku> Just not all of them.
[00:51:59] <hepku> sarnold, right.
[00:52:02] *** Parts: vxwarlock (~netzone@user/vxwarlock) (Closing Window)
[00:52:02] <sarnold> what specifically is missing?
[00:52:23] <hepku> So, I'm trying to switch from a particular version of TCP congestion control to a different version.
[00:52:33] <hepku> TCP Cubic to TCP LP
[00:52:45] <hepku> cubic and reno are loaded up by default in ubuntu
[00:53:14] <hepku> So both inside host and in vm, when I run sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control, I see cubic and reno
[00:54:20] <hepku> But in the host, I am able to run: sudo modprobe -a tcp_lp and load up the module into the running kernel.
[00:54:26] <hepku> And then switch from cubic to lp
[00:54:34] <hepku> But inside the vm, there's no tcp_lp module.
[00:54:56] <sarnold> aha! okay, cool, this makes a *lot* more sense
[00:55:20] <hepku> Which is why I was trying to rebuild the ISO image from which the VM is booted up.
[00:55:31] <hepku> According to this doc: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contrib/building/iso/
[00:56:05] <hepku> What I still don't understand from that doc is the following
[00:56:11] <hepku> this creates the ISO: make out/minikube.iso
[00:56:34] <hepku> But this is what toggles which kernel modules you want to add: make linux-menuconfig
[00:56:45] <hepku> So how does it get "added" to the ISO?

[00:58:40] <sarnold> hepku: if you're lucky they've done a good job with their makefiles and you could just run make linux-menuconfig && make out/minikube.iso and the magic of dependencies would sort it all out, but that feels a bit too magical :)
[00:59:06] <hepku> Yeah
[00:59:09] *** Joins: synapt (NBishop@o.apocaleaps.com)
[00:59:30] <hepku> make linux-menuconfig basically just creates a config file according to what I see on the output
[00:59:53] <sarnold> does it bring up the 'real' linux make menuconfig target? if so, you can search through it with / and look for CONFIG_TCP_CONG_LP
[00:59:57] <hepku> So I guess that latter two steps read the config?
[01:00:19] <hepku> What do you mean 'real' linux make menuconfig target?
[01:00:26] <hepku> It opens up a menu basically
[01:00:33] <hepku> Where I can navigate through and toggle modules I want

[04:09:15] <lostndev> I have a very strange issue, of which I cannot seem to find a reasonable explanation for. Let's assume I have an ubuntu system (18.04.1 LTS). I have a cellular (sim) card adapter that a systemd service brings online. From root it is as if this adapter doesn't have internet (curl returns "No route to host"). But from a local user, the adapter does
[04:09:16] <lostndev> have internet. "route -n" and "ip link" for both accounts are identical. Any ideas where else I could try looking for an explanation would be greatly appreciated.

[04:41:59] <lostndev> The python script is used to pass the "AT" command to the serial tty of the SIM card. The first command is related to configuration (if this was the first boot of the sim it would be required), the 2nd AT is for enabling a mode on the card. Those should realistically just prep the sd card to be able to get a lease.

[05:19:56] <lostndev> sarnold ah got it I expect that to work since it wouldn't be using the sim card's interface 1s
[05:20:21] <sarnold> lostndev: there's an example of /dev/tcp on https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/devref1.html  near the words 'exec'
[05:20:33] <lostndev> sarnold yep both of those work with nc for both accounts to the 216 ip.

[05:24:31] <sarnold> lostndev: okay, so two other programs are getting the exact same outgoing source port, but curl isn't.. maybe keep trying other similar tasks with different tools? openssl s_client, telnet, ping, wget, tcptraceroute, etc? it'd be nice to have more confidence that it's something curl is doing vs something the kernel is doing

[05:28:10] <lostndev> echo "testing" | nc -s 192.168.225.27 216.239.35.0 80 we are successful on both accounts so it leans toward your last comment
[05:29:24] <lostndev> Hmmph ok the same is true for telnet with -b (telnet -b 192.168.225.2 216.239.35.0 80) works on both accounts
[05:29:27] <sarnold> lostndev: I'm *really* confused why just one tool used the sim nic by default :) sorry I'm not more helpful..

[05:31:06] <lostndev> sarnold the paste that didn't specify the sim card nic was just to show that internet worked over wg0 from both accounts. The goal is to ~"know" that internet works if the sim card's nic is used as the source adapter. Rather it should work on both accounts the same.
[05:32:19] <lostndev> sarnold so the test without using the source address with nc isn't ~ a valid test since we want to test internet from the sim card nic. That's why I mentioned the nc -s (binding to the sim card's ip), and this works on both accounts. Which lends us to curl doing something really strange here under the hood.

[08:56:18] <Ginalo> Hi. I have an Ubuntu installation in a BTRFS filesystem. I use Timeshift to take snapshots of it. My problems is that in the used space shown in `df` doesn't match the latest snapshot's size in Timeshift. Why is that?

[09:27:57] <lostndev> sarnold However, wget's --bind-address works just like netcat's bind-address with -s. So I'm thinking it's got to be something particular to how this sim card's nic works under the hood that the interface can't be bound to.

[19:33:49] <ogra> it might be removed from the package cache given it is a security risk to keep the old version around but typically you can force package versions via: "sudo apt install <package>=<version>"
[19:34:07] <ogra> if you want easy rollback, use snaps they have that built in

[19:35:48] <hexo> i dont get why it cant be in apt too
[19:35:59] <ogra> because of the package design of debs
[19:36:20] *** Joins: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa)
[19:36:44] <ogra> debs are only designed to go forward ... even the above =version thing is rather a hack against the design ...
[19:36:44] *** Quits: fizzizist (~Thunderbi@108.162.133.99) (Quit: Bye Bye)
[19:37:17] <ogra> but FF likely has no versioned dependencies so there it might work if you know the exact version and if the old version is still in apt's package cache

Or are desktop installations set up to look elsewhere for network configs? I want to ask first to avoid borking the network config and locking myself out of SSH...
