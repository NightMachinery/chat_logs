[00:00:16] <Foxboron> Nobody is denying gnupg is complicated fwiw :p
[00:00:32] <kline> yeah, i think age probably has a much better UI/UX
[00:00:42] <kline> and in practice will probably be vastly more usable
[00:00:43] <Foxboron> but super weird!
[00:01:10] <Foxboron> Well, the Arch build server is capable of pulling your key
[00:01:19] <kline> my issue is that gpg _should_ and _could_ be as easy, if gpg use in practice didnt mean facing every distinct problem with the same swiss army knife
[00:01:22] <Foxboron> So now I have to fucking debug gnupg today....
[00:01:36] <kline> when we should have a toolbox of specific and obvious tools for each thing we want to do

[00:01:46] <kline> Foxboron, condolences
[00:01:52] <Foxboron> I'm unhappy
[00:03:16] <Foxboron> The issue is that there can be so much happening
[00:03:43] <Foxboron> dirmngr has it's own independant dns cache which might be caching an invalid entry for libera.chat.. and gpg-agent might be enforing some weird lookup option

[00:11:43] <kriive> kline, yeah, but i'd loved to learn something new. :) I'm using tailwindcss atm
[00:14:09] <kline> heres a tip: 90% of website design stuff is total chaff chucked out because people feel its publish or perish and they have to do _something_ to be relevant
[00:14:20] <kline> browsers do almost everything correctly by default
[00:14:46] <kline> if you want to use tailwind, fine, but just use tailwinds defaults and grab a theme pack or something
[00:15:14] <kline> or bootstrap (which i mention because i know it makes an effort to include accessibility stuff, which as a designer, is where almost all of your effort should be focussed anyway(

[02:20:15] <c355E3B> I've found more design advice learning how to lay out building more than websites at this point
[02:21:58] <indigo> kline: Yay, someone else who actually gives a shit about accessibility!
[02:23:35] <kline> indigo, you know the "what <x> thinks we do" meme? What designers think they do: *architecture/art picture* // what they actually do: *picture of them fucking up scrolling while furiously masturbating* // what they should be doing: *designing clean interfaces, interacting with users, and making websites that work well for them*
[02:24:02] <kline> we need to basically fire anyone who doesnt have a significant background in ergonomics
[02:25:40] <kline> when i worked in tech we had one designer whose sole job was this kind of ergonomics design, they had to cover a bunch, but they spent most of their time putting actual designers back in their box when doing the touch-screen based GUI (and eventually got budgeted for hand controllers with actual buttons), getting the mechanical designers to stop putting screws in terrible places, and doing neat

[20:30:07] <banna> as, if you're going to use something day to day, it should be an intense learning curve to make sure you explore the breadth of that tool
[20:30:11] <ngoldbaum> even experienced people, i always have to look up the syntax for bash for loops every time i need to write one
[20:30:25] <imode> shells suck as an interface.
[20:30:32] <ngoldbaum> and i know they exist, i’m sure the majority of bash users aren’t aware it’s a programming language
[20:30:36] <banna> Shells are a terrible example haha yes
[20:30:56] <banna> What I'm riffing on is that there is an ideal, and that ideal is obviously not met wholesomely
[20:31:09] <imode> I don't feel like a steep learning curve is a requirement.
[20:31:32] <banna> For day-to-day things, I think a steep learning curve indicates an interface that makes it a whole lot more useful

[20:31:48] <imode> why gatekeep that.
[20:31:50] <banna> if you're just in and out on a periodic/short basis, then the requirements are different
[20:32:59] <banna> It's not quite gatekeeping - it's just adaption to a tool. Just because a tool/software/system has a sharp learning curve doesn't imply anything really.
[20:33:16] <imode> I mean, user interfaces should be simple enough where I can sit down and know what I'm doing. there's no reason why there needs to be a "sharp learning curve".

[20:34:37] <banna> It's just in my experience, the interfaces born out of the need of that environment tend to have a certain learning curve and expect the user to do a bit of studying before they go on
[20:35:11] <imode> I mean, they really shouldn't. if a user needs to study up before they use your UI, you've failed as a designer.
[20:35:39] <banna> I don't quite really agree with that on the basis for tools that you'll be using every day with software
[20:35:51] <banna> For tools that you'd end up only using once and a while, yes that is a failure.

[20:36:50] <imode> that doesn't encourage critical thinking skills because none of our interfaces are tuned to a progression that reflects our cognitive tendencies of exploration and experimentation.
[20:36:51] <ngoldbaum> but the opposite of that is an IDE
[20:36:59] <ngoldbaum> with buttons and menu items for everything
[20:37:10] <imode> IDEs are needlessly complicated.
[20:37:15] <ngoldbaum> or, like, photoshop
[20:37:24] <banna> I think we may be talking about the same thing,
[20:37:29] <ngoldbaum> adobe UIs are impossibly complicated
[20:37:35] <ngoldbaum> but experts seem to like then
[20:38:32] <banna> just usually we play down what we intend to do to be "simple", when really what we intend to do has many factors at play that - if you make those factors visible, and the user has knowledge of those factors, which appears complex
[20:38:40] <technomancy> it seems like when most people say "IDEs" they mean "Java and C++ IDEs"

[20:43:54] <imode> if there are 500 things I can do, there's always a subject and an object slot. <subject> <action> <object>. thinking about it like that means that there's always a context in which <subject> and <object> need to be available to you.
[20:44:16] <rb> right click object, select subject, you get another object about the given subject which you can interact with
[20:44:18] <imode> I walk into a room, I pick up a wrench, there's a finite amount of things that I can use that wrench on.
[20:44:42] <imode> the scope of the wrench is bounded by the room I'm in, because the room I'm in contains a finite amount of objects.
[20:45:13] <imode> in the wrench's case, I'm forming actions of the form `wrench <action> <object>`
[20:45:18] *** Joins: spacebyte (~spacebyte@a94-132-168-30.cpe.netcabo.pt)
[20:45:34] <imode> unless the wrench is applicable to objects in other rooms, I should be locked into that room until I put the wrench down.
[20:45:38] <imode> makerspace style.
[20:46:21] <rb> just drag it into the other self desktops, or another user connected to the same self world through a remote window would be able to pick it up
[20:46:28] <rb> you want pair programming? i'll show you pair programming
[20:46:31] <banna> I do agree that an interface should certainly convey as much metadata to the user as possible for those 500 actions
[20:46:38] <imode> not metadata. context.
[20:46:50] <imode> if I'm staring at a thing, I should be able to only do things to that thing that make sense.
[20:47:22] <banna> however, no matter what, to be as useful as possible, learning how to compose what that software is able to do will be different for everything - and has a learning curve that is steeper than just "do the thing"
[20:48:12] <banna> There are degrees at which we want to divert our attention and pay attention to more critical things,
[20:48:28] <imode> if you wanna shift from one thing to another, you'll be captive in that thing until you wanna stop doing it.
[20:48:42] <banna> but with certain softwares the interface is probably better left as composable and "you'll have to learn a lot before you're productive" kind of way
[20:49:26] <imode> being productive shouldn't necessitate exponential growth in interactions between thing.
[20:49:26] <banna> essentially, I'm coining the difference between building a racecar to beat F1 teams and buying a Toyota Camry
[20:49:29] <imode> *things
[20:49:41] <banna> you won't be very fast in a toyota camry, but you don't really have to know a lot about it
[20:49:54] <imode> yes, and nobody outside of a few people drives the racecar.
[20:49:56] <banna> you can be very fast in a racecar you built, but goddamnit you have to build a racecar

[20:50:16] <imode> so why are we advocating for racecar UI design lmao.
[20:50:17] <banna> what I'm more or less getting at is the sharper the learning curve, the more potent the tool

[20:56:37] <banna> The learning curve is terribly sharp.
[20:57:24] <banna> but it will do the thing better than any other thing because it was built in an environment where they could specify to a level of detail that is unreasonable for literally 99.99% of things
[20:57:34] <imode> mm, yeah, I agree with you there, guess I was reading it wrong.
[20:58:14] <banna> I do 100% adovocate for nice learning curves with everything though. I want software/computing system interfaces to be as seamless as possible
[20:58:59] <banna> however I am aware that that pursuit dulls the blade per-se in other areas that are better suited to more nuts-and-bolts
[20:59:24] <imode> I hate mobile interfaces but recognize that contextual actions that dominate the whole UI are very useful.
[20:59:38] <imode> I feel like you can step back and make it more complex and apply it to a desktop environment.
[20:59:56] <banna> Me too. I get into an existensial rage when trying to walk my grandmother though her phone
[21:00:11] <banna> it's... probably not that healthy haha
[21:00:12] <imode> you can't accidentally delete a file on your file system by working on your email on android.
[21:00:35] <imode> that in and of itself is a fucking revolution.
[21:00:57] <banna> The work that has been done to prevent destructive actions is actually kind of impressive yes
[21:01:28] <imode> we just need to channel that work into "preventing the user from doing things that don't make sense".
[21:01:45] <imode> just move the requirements one rung higher.
[21:02:07] <banna> Until we're connected to neurallink streaming our thoughts directly to twitter
[21:02:16] <banna> (/s)
[21:02:31] <imode> one wonders what oriface they'll go through. :P
[21:02:37] <indigo> Cloud to butt
[21:02:51] <banna> In all seriousness I think that area of study is absolutely fascinating
[21:03:21] <banna> there's non-invasive stuff like LORETA
[21:03:43] <banna> (which at this point is pretty outdated)

[23:05:43] <kline> just sixel your way to victory tbh
[23:06:03] <skrzyp> kline: of course it's not, but it's more like a thin renderer around imgui while impressive it still requires you to know imgui and work around its own design issues/features
[23:06:25] <kline> this is always going to be the case for a framework
[23:06:44] <kline> either you go low level and dont have to deal with any opinions/paradigm

[23:50:26] <imode> wild..
[23:50:56] <skrzyp> now it's a bit better and there's also another company getting linux on their boxes, but from what I inspected they're doing that with vanilla desktop ubuntu scripted around for as low cost as possible
[23:51:04] <skrzyp> but now it's completely not my business at all
[23:52:54] <skrzyp> imode: that's wild, but it's even wilder if you compare that most images are build to this date and they migrated onto win9x-xp-xpe in late 00s or even early 10s (with some exceptions doing that since 90s) - before that the machines were running on proprietary boards much like arcades, with motorola 680x0 series inside
[23:53:31] <imode> kinda unsurprising because you had to do proprietary boards for certain games.
[23:53:54] <skrzyp> (the majority of sales for 68ks were not for home computing or even unix workstations, but for telco and then gambling, to the point that $some_company got the production line for its own)
[23:53:55] <imode> you didn't have standard hardware for a lot of things.
[23:55:15] <skrzyp> imode: oh, not like that, the hardware platform was more or less standard since 80s thru late 00s with various revisions, but it was expandable so each game could have its own addon cards for mechanical, sound or graphical attractiveness
[23:55:59] <imode> right, I was thinking the graphical stuff mostly.
[23:56:05] <imode> graphics and audio.
[23:56:39] <skrzyp> to be honest, the hardware was wild, you wouldn't even assume that slot machines were making rounds around Amiga at its heyday or even the arcade boards
[23:56:56] <imode> the same went for arcade cabinets, where a lot of the chipset was unique from game to game.
[23:57:15] <skrzyp> too bad its still under heavy IP and NDA walls so no one could do any sort of preservation and emulation work
