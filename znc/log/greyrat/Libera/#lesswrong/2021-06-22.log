[11:44:45] <dbohdan2> gwern: I find a specific aspect of "the wealthy and successful are healthier" interesting.  It seems that *new* wealth can cause obesity.  While I have no data to test this, and I doubt anybody does, my guess is that during the "primitive accumulation of capital" phase in post-Soviet countries successful people, particularly men, became disproportionately obese.  They had access to more and novel food, and
[11:44:47] <dbohdan2> also to more sugary food.  Part of it may have been the increased consumption of alcohol.
