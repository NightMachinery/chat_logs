[02:25:18] <bpalmer> e3d3: copy-file's documentation specifies a number of ways that it raises errors
[02:25:45] <bpalmer> e.g., "If OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is nil, signal a ‘file-already-exists’ error without overwriting."
[02:26:24] <bpalmer> See C-h f copy-file RET . Stat is probably nice (or stat + mac like an md5sum  for more surety) , but if it doesn't throw a signal, it "should" have worked.

[02:44:37] <e3d3> but with cp I don't loose overview with conditions, nesting etc.
[02:44:41] <bpalmer> The only indication that 'cp a b' failed available programmatically is $?  (which you have to either explicitly examine, or run with something like set -e  on for your shell)
[02:45:15] <bpalmer> e3d3: if you don't handle copy-file's error, the signal will propagate to the top of the stack and the user will see an error
[02:45:49] <bpalmer> so if you aren't programatically doing anything, you don't need to wrap it in any thing: just call (copy-file a b) (foo)   and foo will only be executed if copy-file succeeded (or thinks it did)
[02:46:41] <bpalmer> it's almost identical to java/ruby/C++ exceptions.
[02:47:43] <e3d3> ??? Does that works like (copy-file a b) && (foo)
[02:48:22] <e3d3> I tried by using (if (copy-file ....) (message bla))

[05:32:50] <bpalmer> bind it to nil in org-mode-map , probably
[05:33:23] <grym> ahhh that's where that goes 
[05:33:25] <grym> right, of course
[05:33:34] <bpalmer> or set up your own minor mode that binds C-'  ; maps are looked up on text-properties, minor mode, major mode, global map in order.

[05:35:56] <bpalmer> There are a few modes that do something different; eshell does (or at least did) a very annoying habit where each new eshell buffer gets a brand new local map that inherits from the standard eshell map, so that local set key only affects that one buffer
[05:38:06] <grym> (require 'bind-key)  (unbind-key "C-'" org-mode-map)  did it when org gets loaded

[06:02:49] <bpalmer> Some nice discussion in the comments about whether jurisdictions would or could accept "smart contracts" as actual contracts
[06:03:10] <grym> i believe you mean "nice description of the contract that favors one party perhaps more than expected"  :P
[06:03:57] <grym> https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/05/26/an-introduction-to-smart-contracts-and-their-potential-and-inherent-limitations/  is what i dug up a few days ago 
[06:03:58] <rudybot> https://teensy.info/KMtN1Xjvrp
[06:04:48] <grym> my more serious answer is that i think there's a dearth of case law to date and until that changes it's all kind of up in the hair 
[06:04:51] <grym> air, too!
[06:05:39] <bpalmer> I do wonder if "smart contracts"'s manifest and obvious failures to date have given pause to some of the "laws should be compiled in a formal programming-esque language" believers (a group I used to belong to)
[06:05:55] <bpalmer> s/'s/'/
[06:05:59] <johnjay> well the thing is case law is pretty clear. you can't just get someone to sign a piece of paper and say aha now i own all your life savings haha
[06:06:12] <grym> bpalmer: that idea was dislodged pretty firmly by, uh, jean luc picard 
[06:06:13] <johnjay> you have to have certain ingredients. meeting of minds. consideration. agreement.
[06:06:17] <grym> of all screenwritten things 
[06:06:32] <johnjay> if a smart contract says you get all my stuff if i don't pay you 5 bitcoins they aren't going to honor that
[06:06:44] <johnjay> and ultimately a contract has to be enforced to be valid
[06:06:59] <bpalmer> grym: I take his proofs with a grain of salt. He couldn't even see the fifth light!
[06:07:01] <johnjay> the blockchain can take all your bitcoin but that doesn't mean you can take stuff IRL
[06:07:22] <grym> bpalmer: the 'there can be no justice ... ' line was fairly compelling 
[06:07:44] <grym> but i'm a personalist anyway so it's just reinforcing what i already thought 
[06:07:45] <johnjay> tldr you can't solve social problems with technology. but you can definitely create more!
[06:08:08] <grym> johnjay: right; and conflating law (a social thing) with technology is asking for it
[06:08:38] <grym> or at least gets murky fast, but hey that's society 
[06:08:44] <johnjay> yeah. esp when you get people trying to scam others with the "you didn't read the full text of the smart contract that said i get your life savings so haha"
[06:09:13] <grym> it's not like contracts lawyers don't do things like this
[06:09:13] <johnjay> i'm pretty jaded after all the scams in crypto
[06:09:20] <grym> but humans are in the loop!
[06:09:31] <grym> there was that maine truckers case that hinged on a syntax error.  literally a syntax error 
[06:09:43] <grym> so the analogy to "your contract had a bug" is pretty on the nose in that case
[06:10:05] <johnjay> there was a crypto scam by some youtuber. basically right before the coin went live they changed the code to allow the whales to cash out
[06:10:22] <johnjay> so immediately they did, crashing the price
[06:11:03] <grym> my sense about that sort of thing is that basically every single possible financial scam that someone's thought up between about since we had money and about 1930 is now being recapitulated but now with GPUs, and i like my shirt thank you
[06:11:12] <bpalmer> grym: I'm assuming you mean the Maine truck driver overtime case; that wasn't a syntax error, but an ambiguity due to lack of an Oxford comma.
[06:11:25] <grym> bpalmer: if the parser can't make a decision ...

[06:12:29] <grym> to be fair, i should say that the case was decided on a matter of linguistic syntax, disjoint perhaps from authorial intent of the document, in a way that is very analogous to smart contract haxx
[06:13:02] <grym> and i do mean the oxford comma case, yeah 
[06:13:14] <johnjay> yes. my point is that people probably will do a lot of ways to write contracts to scam people or just lie outright and a judge won't just take "the smart contract says so" as a reason
[06:13:35] <grym> well if it really is a contract, then it's off to contracts jail with you!

[18:20:19] <wasamasa> and one of them goaded me into writing a peephole optimizer
[18:20:19] <codingquark> bremner: those are emacsconf videos
[18:20:58] <codingquark> wasamasa: my current issue is that I am not able to pass code blocks around in babel :(
[18:21:43] <roadie> ok, thank you grym and aniketgm 
[18:22:20] <codingquark> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization what for real?
[18:22:27] <wasamasa> yes
[18:22:37] <acdw> poophole optimizer
[18:23:17] <wasamasa> AoC is like 80% interpreting some whacko set of instructions/coordinates, 10% pathfinding and 10% CPU things
[18:23:35] <wasamasa> one of these CPU challenges is so inefficient that you're supposed to optimize the program that's being executed

[18:23:43] <wasamasa> which is self-modifying, mind you
[18:24:02] <wasamasa> but it's possible to do that with the approach outlined in the link above
[18:24:21] <wasamasa> where you'd look for a common inefficient pattern and replace it by more efficient code
[18:24:44] <wasamasa> this is actually done in emulators and known as dynarec
[18:24:59] <wasamasa> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation
[18:25:33] <acdw> AoC is the hardest word problems
[18:26:14] <wasamasa> the elisp byte-code compiler has a peephole optimizer, too
[18:26:20] <codingquark> wasamasa: looks like AoC is tricking us into learning such methods without knowing what we are doing?
[18:26:21] <wasamasa> it's reasonably easy to read
[18:26:31] <wasamasa> well, yes
[18:26:42] <wasamasa> I usually punt on the path finding tasks, unless they're very easy
[18:26:50] <wasamasa> because then I'd have to actually think about algorithms
[18:27:12] <codingquark> So far, list datastructure has fit so nicely for all things

[21:11:04] <grym> i could've sworn i saw an interleaved/interlineated package like this; did acdw or ldlework tell me about it...

[21:12:01] <tianshu> edrx: you mean the language in code?
[21:12:30] <tianshu> no limit on languages
[21:12:33] <edrx> btw: "be found automatically" is something separate. I tried to do that in several ways and I realized that I prefer to not have a way to find the tests automatically.
[21:13:06] <hodapp> grym: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11418v2 first I thought this paper was semi-cool and then I saw that they basically just re-did convnets and showed that they perform as well as... convnets
