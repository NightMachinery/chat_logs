[06:16:21] <ImoutoBot> [title] 2021 Tax Brackets | 2021 Federal Income Tax Brackets & Rates
[06:16:30] <Nanobot> Most of my income will be from long-term capital gains.
[06:18:15] <Nanobot> So, the top bracket is currently 20%, plus a 3.8% surtax for investment income.
[06:18:58] <Nanobot> (Plus, California's top tax bracket is 13.3%)
[06:21:45] <Nanobot> If I sell all of my bitcoin at $100k under the current rates, I'll owe nearly $800k in taxes and will have over $1.5m left over. That meets my threshold for retiring.
[06:21:57] <Nanobot> *$1.2m
[06:23:43] <Nanobot> Unfortunately, I have no idea whether the 2021 rates will actually be the current rates. At one point, it was going to be almost double the current rates.
[06:24:29] <Nanobot> I don't mind taxes going up. I just want to know what the rates are, especially since they keep talking about wanting to make the new rates retroactive.

[14:41:55] <emmeka> JesseDesu2 the tl;dr: bash scripts are the same as what you'd type directly into the terminal, except you save it as a plain text file as .sh, and put #!/bin/bash at the top of it.
[14:42:17] <JesseDesu2> why
[14:42:20] <JesseDesu2> who needs it
[14:42:21] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: python has many problems of compatibility thru time, but it's still better than Java that never fixes old bugs

[14:43:16] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: depends
[14:43:19] <JesseDesu2> i dont know any concrete examples of scripting
[14:43:27] <emmeka> well it lets you do some more complicated things than a single typed command can, but also, it lets you simplify something you need to do all the time
[14:43:30] <amigojapan> emmeka: it also has loops and conditional statements
[14:43:32] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: not a fan of java either, but for different reasons
[14:43:33] <emmeka> right
[14:43:42] <JesseDesu2> like what
[14:44:00] <zoidberg> JesseDesu2: you can do a lot of things with bash scripts. Like updating your pc regularly without manually doing it. Start application at start up and do what you usually do when you login
[14:44:05] <emmeka> uhhhhh idk do you want to see my most complicated shell script. it's probably going to make someone with actual programming knowledge scream.
[14:44:20] <zoidberg> JesseDesu2: makes life more lazy
[14:44:20] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: of your purpose is compatibility thru time, it is good at that
[14:44:41] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: sure, but there are other options

[14:46:50] <emmeka> JesseDesu2 so for example I have a shell script to change the digital audio sampling rate of my PC
[14:47:10] <JesseDesu2> shouldnt you use the highest
[14:47:15] <JesseDesu2> set and forget
[14:47:59] <emmeka> no, because I run everything digital audio with HDMI & optical cables. Nothing analog here. and I have a few things that aren't compatible with higher sampling rates.
[14:48:33] <Sapphirus> That makes sense. I do the same, but don't have that issue as I don't have multiple runs.

[14:52:43] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: that introduces python3 syntax which is absent in real logo

[14:52:53] <Berlin36> i think of shifting to Golang

[14:53:19] <emmeka> Sapphirus I have an HDMI matrix with digital audio de-embedding as optical, and run that to a pair of TV headphones. My idea was that I could just have 1 single audio sink for the PC that connects to everything, and also not have to worry about analog crap like ground loops and interference
[14:53:24] <Llamamoe> KatrinValerie: I think that's erroneous. You only really need to understand the concept of memory allocation, cache friendliness, and branch prediction for performance, and other than that learning low-level languages is meaningless and just bombards the learnee with a myriad of meaningless clutter that is irrelevant to learning to conceptualize code

[14:54:34] <Llamamoe> I'd argue that a good starter language would be reasonably minimalistic, high-level, statically typed
[14:54:46] <Sapphirus> emmeka, yeah, that does sound like a problem, which could be sorted by an appropriate piece of hardware.

[14:59:25] <Llamamoe> Urchin[emacs]: Classes aren't evil. They're often misused, but they're a decent dynamic polymorphism abstraction 
[14:59:36] <KatrinValerie> Urchin[emacs]: I personally think it makes some things more clear and it makes it easier to reuse code
[14:59:46] <amigojapan> zoidberg: after that you should be more capable of starting a language like python with less comprehension problems

[15:00:16] <KatrinValerie> Urchin[emacs]: for a concept like a goal oriented AI client, you will want to use some abstraction
[15:00:31] <Bco1981_2> hm, only 118mb ram used...
[15:00:34] <KatrinValerie> though you can do all that without classes, but you will end up working around the lack of classes

[15:01:39] <KatrinValerie> custom compiling a size optimized kernel with just the stuff you really need
[15:01:46] <KatrinValerie> replacing glibc
[15:01:57] <zoidberg> amigojapan: that's also a good start at school level maybe. The undergrads here are introduced to programming through python.
[15:01:57] <Bco1981_2> yeah. sounds like a lot of work
[15:02:11] <Sapphirus> Problem with having a hifi when watching anime is how you've got one more element to be judgemental about.
[15:02:15] <KatrinValerie> Or you just use another distro that is designed to be smaller
[15:02:44] <Urchin[emacs]> Bco1981_2: the question is, is that good enough for your purposes?
[15:02:53] <KatrinValerie> zoidberg: Python is generally being adopted more and more in universities
[15:02:53] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I learned logo at 8 years old without a teacher or a manual
[15:02:54] <Bco1981_2> so, i can check mark slackware, and arch now
[15:02:57] <Sapphirus> There's very few anime that have made me go "wow" in the audio engineering department. 
[15:03:02] <Bco1981_2> Urchin[emacs]: it's just for testing

[15:03:47] <Bco1981_2> when linux = windows regarding games... maybe
[15:03:51] <Urchin[emacs]> Python is a pretty good teaching tool, IMO, I never really disputed it, my dislike of it stems from other reasons (compatibility through time being foremost, I'm lazy)
[15:04:01] <zoidberg> yes KatrinValerie, it's not just for learning, people are getting jobs with python on their cv

[16:18:58] <Cryowolf> should we make money
[16:19:03] <darkwitch> you first have to get to 100 Cryowolf
[16:19:19] <Cryowolf> yes but you realize that in the real world you need contracts
[16:19:25] <Cryowolf> legal obligations etc
[16:19:38] <Cryowolf> of ownership, distribution and so on
[16:20:02] <Cryowolf> the contract then has to say 50/50, equal partners

[16:20:29] <Cryowolf> you get that right?
[16:21:41] <darkwitch> hey I'm just saying that half of nothing is still nothing
[16:22:13] <Berlin36> yes but, in case they do make money then they'll get 50/50
[16:22:46] <Berlin36> why do i keep putting a coma after "but"
[16:23:02] <Cryowolf> it is, but actually creating a lightnovel, illustration, story, narrative, lore, characters etc etc instead of just going "Wouldn't it be cool if I could make a lightnovel"
[16:23:16] <Cryowolf> that's more than nothing
[16:23:39] <Berlin36> ye
[16:23:58] <darkwitch> hey I'm purely talking about profits of said finished product
[16:24:03] <Cryowolf> we're both aware it might not make anything and it might take a few volumes to even gain attention
[16:24:07] <Berlin36> i once tried to collaborate with a guy too
[16:24:14] <Berlin36> this didn't involve making any money
[16:24:18] <darkwitch> hey it's fun to start every line with hey
[16:24:20] <Berlin36> just for fun and training skills
[16:24:33] <Berlin36> we tried to do a library related to encryption algorithms
[16:24:48] <Cryowolf> darkwitch, we're planning to do this ith the new style of "income". Using Patreon etc
[16:24:53] <Cryowolf> donations
[16:25:05] <Berlin36> oh
[16:25:13] <Cryowolf> but its free either way
[16:25:40] <darkwitch> hey I almost like Patreon :)
[16:25:45] <Cryowolf> if you want you can donate, what "benefits" we'll add to tiers we don't know. We haven't discussed
[16:26:13] <Cryowolf> but finding a publisher is nearly impossible but if we can find a demographic, a market. People who enjoy what we produce
[16:26:21] <Cryowolf> we can make money through patreon and such
[16:26:22] <Berlin36> you can do some aditional content only for patreon
[16:26:43] <Cryowolf> and it will give us more creative freedom
[16:26:53] <Berlin36> and people willing to see more, will pay to see that 
[16:27:09] <Cryowolf> we won't have a publisher telling us "do this or we cancel you"
[16:27:42] <Cryowolf> I don't want to create story etc that's needed to undertand the narrative and have it locked away
[16:28:10] <Sapphirus> Fact that Japanese culture is immune to cancel culture I think is one part of why it's gaining in popularity.
[16:28:17] <Cryowolf> tiers would be more likely to include "sketches and unused panels from this volume"
[16:28:29] <Sapphirus> Immune to 'western cancel culture'. I'm not sure if anything like that exists in Japan.
[16:28:41] <Cryowolf> it does exist in Japan
[16:28:48] <Berlin36> i've heard about cancel culture, what is it?
[16:29:09] <Cryowolf> But its more focused on what you do to someones favorite character
[16:29:27] <Sapphirus> That's a tad bit different than the political nightmare in the west.
[16:29:44] <Cryowolf> Berlin36, it's basically angry little man babies trying to get someone fired or someones project, tv show or whatnot cancelled because they said or did something they didnt like
[16:29:53] <Cryowolf> man or woman babies
[16:29:55] <Berlin36> oh
[16:30:00] <Berlin36> i see
[16:30:06] <Berlin36> vegans 
[16:30:16] <Berlin36> lmao sorry ^
[16:30:28] <Cryowolf> like "That character called someone a fag, that means this entire tv show is homophobic and not just that one character!"
[16:30:40] <Cryowolf> and they go batshit crazy
[16:30:56] <Berlin36> yeye
[16:31:05] <Sapphirus> Hypothesis of mine is that as western media gets watered down -- anime will grow in popularity as its filling in a gap in the market.
[16:31:06] <Cryowolf> they can't understand and separate fiction from reality. Same goes for if a creator or someone has an opinion they dont like
[16:31:21] <Cryowolf> then they want the show or whatnot cancelled because of that person
[16:31:30] <Sapphirus> Also I like not having politics intertwined into media I want to sit and enjoy.
[16:31:37] <Sapphirus> So maybe this is more of a me thing, but I don't know.
[16:31:51] <Cryowolf> yes but theyve stopped doing that I think 
[16:31:57] <Cryowolf> cause they lost ratings or buyers
[16:32:08] <Cryowolf> people aren't interested in mirror politics
[16:32:30] <Sapphirus> Tougher to buy people back after you loose them vs. never having lost them in the first place.
[16:32:45] <Cryowolf> you can have political stuff in a game sure, but by mirror politics I mean like duplicating what is happening in reality through their lens and perspective and telling you what to think about it
[16:32:45] <Sapphirus> I've probably not consumed traditional western media in eons.
[16:33:05] <Sapphirus> it got to a point wherein I was like "This is so bad I wouldn't even pirate it."
[16:33:41] <Cryowolf> yeah...I can ignore those things if its just like a one-liner at some point
[16:33:57] <Cryowolf> which was probably demanded by some executive
[16:34:04] <Cryowolf> and then its never used again
[16:35:05] <Cryowolf> in Japan it's more related to the publisher or editor making demands of the creatora nd unless the creator is a powerhouse (like mangaka of One Piece) they have to obey the editor or they're cancelled
[16:35:23] <Cryowolf> so it's different in Japan
[16:35:45] <Sapphirus> Yeah, that is less political per se.
[16:36:22] <Cryowolf> it's still irritating but if the editor is good and the writer/illustrators are good
[16:36:25] <Cryowolf> then things line up
[16:36:30] <Cryowolf> if not, then it ends like Bleach did

[16:39:33] <Cryowolf> we direct different things. I mean he directs scenes based on his experience as an artist and how it can best be drawn, while I direct more in general what's happening without every detail

[16:40:22] <Sapphirus> It was just too much and I stomached it just out of pure curiosity.
[16:40:36] <Cryowolf> what's invincible?

[16:55:02] <Cryowolf> we won't have "on panel sex" and I won't be writing detailed sex scenes
[16:55:17] <Cryowolf> I'll make it obvious sex is happening or happened

[16:59:34] <Cryowolf> this is partially because it makes me uncomfortable to write a sex scene Sapphirus. And having explicit stuff, or overly explicit. Would have us kicked off Patreon but funny enuogh that only applies to sex and not violence
[17:02:39] *** Joins: ezekielnoob (~ezekielno@180.190.111.136)
[17:03:04] <Sapphirus> So Patreon being an American company -- that element doesn't surprise me.

[17:03:51] <Sxem> i loved invincible
[17:04:22] <Cryowolf> we'll see how things go though, we're working on the lore and world right now. We want established rules of the world, kind of like the laws of physics in our world.
[17:04:59] <Cryowolf> The world we make should have an established set of rules on how it works. So we don't break them either and they are always there in the background, establishing how it works
[17:05:13] <Sapphirus> Sxem, don't get me wrong, there were moments it had me choking on laughter.
[17:05:51] <Sapphirus> But the inorganic characters forced into the plot was unforgivable in my opinion.
[17:06:59] <Sapphirus> Had to have one of each race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. There was nothing organic about it.
[17:08:00] <Cryowolf> oh I hate that

[17:08:34] <Cryowolf> that takes me out of it

[17:11:16] <Sapphirus> Not only that, as a minority myself (prefer not to say anything further), I almost felt insulted by some of the stereotypes perpetuated by a few of the characters. 
[17:11:42] <Cryowolf> the "ethnic composition" of our world will be largely geographical since fast transportation is mostly for the rich so getting there is a bit of a task
[17:12:14] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, yeah I imagine it must be insulting. Kinda like how they keep pushing "LatinX" down the throats of hispanics
[17:12:53] <Cryowolf> and it's a bunch of self-righteous white people doing it and if someone that's Latino comes and says "I don't like this shit", they get called racist
[17:12:58] <Cryowolf> it's so bizzarre
[17:13:15] <Cryowolf> but thankfully the people doing this crap is a very small group, even if loud
[17:13:35] <Cryowolf> and companies are catching up with the times. that twitter isn't representative of RL
[17:13:50] <Sapphirus> Or if you're a sexual minority, and you complain about the stereotype portrayed, you'll be called homophobic and othered quite fast.

[17:15:27] <Sapphirus> Fortunately this viewpoint, Cryowolf, is far more common than the loudmouthed Twitter mob, which is a minority of a minority, would like you to believe.

[17:16:02] <Cryowolf> there are apparently long winded ways of describing your sexuality that comes back to meaning you're straight. But since you just used that long winded explanation, the insane people will think youre special

[17:17:01] <Cryowolf> and pansexual never made any sense to me since it just means "bisexual with an attraction to personality"
[17:17:05] <Sapphirus> Yeah, at some level, some people do this stuff so they don't have to put effort into building character.
[17:17:30] <Cryowolf> I don't understand it and maybe that makes me a boomer
[17:17:54] <Sapphirus> Very much a thinly, veiled cover around what is otherwise a very shallow character. I'd almost attribute a lot of this stuff to narcissism.
[17:18:24] <Sapphirus> That could probably put me in hot water depending on where and when I would say something like that.
[17:18:40] <Cryowolf> I'm not close-minded. Live life however you want, whatever your sexuality may be, your gender, your skin color, your ethnicity (to those who dont know, yes, ethnicity is different from skin color), your religion and whatever. As long as what you're doing doesn't harm anyone else, I don't care
[17:19:23] <Sapphirus> Well, allowing people to integrate without making a big deal about it seems like a tall order for these folks.
[17:19:32] <Sapphirus> Ideally that's where it should've ended.
[17:20:06] <Cryowolf> and thats perhaps the best thing, I dunno. I've heard from a few people with different sexuailties or skin color etc that when I say "I don't care" that makes them feel relieved
[17:20:08] <Poeticode> i'm sexually attracted to floppy disks
[17:20:36] <Cryowolf> and by dont care I mean I don't care who they fuck, what color their skin is, what god they pray to and so on
[17:20:42] <Cryowolf> it's none of my business
[17:21:00] <Sapphirus> Crywolf, it is a relieving thing in this hyper-identity driven world we've unfortunately found ourselves in.

[17:52:47] <Cryowolf> middle ground?
[17:52:52] <Cryowolf> have you read berserk?
[17:53:06] <Cryowolf> or Claymore?
[17:53:31] <Cryowolf> since I'm not making a shounen here, though there will be battles
[17:53:35] <Cryowolf> a few of em
[17:54:44] <Cryowolf> one example though is how they find a demons...home. Where it feeds and how the remains of what it didnt digest is stuck to the walls almost as a tapestry or decoration
[17:54:50] <Sapphirus> I'm talking more or less about the back story. I don't possess myself with characters to the point of getting a favouritism complex.

[17:55:16] <Sapphirus> So as long it makes sense in the story, I'm not really bothered by it.
[17:55:23] <Cryowolf> and in the middle of the room there's a crib and over it one of those things that spin

[17:55:36] <Urchin[emacs]> hi
[17:55:47] <Cryowolf> you're left with the ambiguous lack of knowledge
[17:56:17] <Sapphirus> You're talking to someone who is willing to 'disgustingly' justify the debuf of a character as a simple plot device for the writers in a long-running shounen. 
[17:56:28] <Sapphirus> I'd probably be 100% fine with it. Stuff like that doesn't piss me off.
[17:56:55] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, well the story would be that the demon is feeding to stay corporeal because until it finds a host powerful enough to contain it. If it doesn't eat a lot, all the time, it will go back into the astral plane
[17:57:11] <Sapphirus> That sounds intriguing.
[17:57:14] <Cryowolf> so it has to hunt and eat
[17:57:32] <Sapphirus> Which is entirely logical.
[17:57:36] <Cryowolf> yeh
[17:58:00] <Cryowolf> I also want to empathize that this doesnt make the demon evil
[17:58:07] <Cryowolf> no more than it makes a lion evil
[17:58:25] <cth> ok, the jujutsu anime turned out to be trash
[17:58:27] <Cryowolf> it makes it dangerous, lethal etc sure

[18:15:47] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, assuming that I'll have $1mil by the time I retire, and assuming that I'd spend $2000 per month. Not considering inflation, it'd take me 40 years to deplete my savings.
[18:15:48] <Poeticode> literally the most cold & calculated character you can find, tho the plot is that he gradually learns how to be emotional
[18:15:52] <cth> and I watched bebop. it's good too

[18:16:38] <cth> Cryowolf, thanks, I will watch Mahouka
[18:17:07] <Cryowolf> the demon king one is also pretty good
[18:17:12] <cth> Urchin[emacs], I will watch Inuyashiki though. thanks.
[18:17:13] <Cryowolf> since he's as cold as it gets
[18:17:24] <cth> I enjoyed the demon king, thanks
[18:17:35] <Cryowolf> imagine resurrecting and killing his opponent over and over and over and over for pure enjoyment
[18:17:46] <ezekielnoob> Sadale that looks fine
[18:17:52] <cth> demon king isikai, right?
[18:17:55] <ezekielnoob> i suppose invest on something tho for better passive
[18:17:58] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, inflation tho. Anyway I could just reinvest my savings.
[18:18:01] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, oh how's the tax there?
[18:18:04] <Cryowolf> cth, isekai? no
[18:18:07] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: where boobs?
[18:18:08] <cth> eh
[18:18:16] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, here barely anything got taxed. I'd imagine I'd have to pay quite a bit of tax there.
[18:18:16] <ezekielnoob> uh tax here is probably 10-30%
[18:18:19] <Cryowolf> cth, here again https://myanimelist.net/anime/40496/Maou_Gakuin_no_Futekigousha__Shijou_Saikyou_no_Maou_no_Shiso_Tensei_shite_Shison-tachi_no_Gakkou_e_Kayou?q=misfit&cat=anime

[18:18:26] <Urchin[emacs]> cth: for an MC that is OK with boobs (except that one arc when he lost his memory and thought he was a girl, and had some trauma on top), there's no beating Alexander Nikolaevich Hell, from Seikon no Qwaser, show about alchemists that get powerups by sucking on boobs of virgins
[18:18:34] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, That's for capital gain and shit. Does PH have any assets tax there?
[18:18:36] <ezekielnoob> things are cheap here tho
[18:18:42] <ezekielnoob> yes there are capital gains tax
[18:18:44] <cth> hell
[18:18:45] <ezekielnoob> i don't know that tho
[18:18:54] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, assets tax like if you have a mil of US dollars they'd charge you 1% of that.
[18:19:12] <Cryowolf> cth, it's about a demon king that's reborn and is unphased by any approaches by women
[18:19:12] <Sadale> I see.
[18:19:32] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, any idea on what get taxed there? income, capital gain, what else?
[18:19:33] <Cryowolf> there's also an Isekai called Overlord where the MC becomes frequently less phased by it
[18:19:42] <cth> ok folks, thanks a lot, I've got four great suggestions. So: Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, the Demon King, the  Alexander Nikolaevich Hell aaaand...Inuyashiki And also Captain Harlock. That's enough.
[18:19:46] <ezekielnoob> Sadale i assume same things are you see in USA
[18:19:53] <cth> many thanks :)
[18:19:57] <Cryowolf> Dororo is about a very overpowered cursed guy in medieval Japan
[18:20:00] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, ah I've no idea on how things are taxed there xD
[18:20:08] <ezekielnoob> ur gona be fine :p
[18:20:19] <Cryowolf> Gungrave is about a mobster and later about an undead mobster fighting monsters
[18:20:20] <Urchin[emacs]> cth: the show is Seikon no Qwaser, character is Alexander Nikolaevich Hell
[18:20:41] <cth> thanks
[18:20:43] <Urchin[emacs]> cth: and it's pretty... ecchi as fuck
[18:20:48] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, here the main things that got taxed are income, business profit tax. They got taxed ro up to 17%. There's a tiny tax for sale of a few items, including housing, cars, tabaco, etc. Surprise. There's no capital gain tax.
[18:20:53] <Urchin[emacs]> cth: with lots of BDSM
[18:20:59] <cth> uh
[18:21:03] <cth> maybe I'll skip it then
[18:21:08] <Cryowolf> Noragami is great, it's about an unnamed God solving things for a penny but there's a reason he's unnamed....cause he was a God of something else before
[18:21:17] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, not really. I'd have to account for the tax if I plan to move there. Especially if there's any stupid shit like capital transfer tax.
[18:21:23] <cth> I find erotic cringy in anime. If I want erotic, I watch hentai
[18:21:30] <MootPoot> Sadale: I will sex you
[18:21:32] <Cryowolf> Skip Qwaiser, it's fetish material. He is powered by sucking milk from tits

[18:24:44] <Cryowolf> cth check those links I gave above
[18:25:07] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: in the old version, Reinhard is set up less as a villain, but is also a darker character as well
[18:25:27] <cth> My brother suggested darker than black. I watched it. It looks like what I would like, but I didn't believe it. The MC should've died a lot of times and the only reason why he survived is cuz... the enemies became a lot weaker with no reason
[18:25:31] <cth> it's not believable.
[18:26:12] <Poeticode> too much anime talk going on in here
[18:26:12] <cth> I will add dororo to the list
[18:26:22] <Cryowolf> no there is a reason, but you wont get it unless you finish it
[18:26:38] <MootPoot> cth: if you dont want to do american cartoon superheros - I suggest you abandon anime tbh - there is much more of what it seems like what you want to be found in manga or LNs

[18:28:12] <cth> MootPoot, I don't want to read manga. I read normal books, classical literature. I mostly go for anime to watch on background while I work. I also only watch dubbed to be able to not look at it. It's on a separate screen and doesn't interfere with me working, while I'm still able to watch it if there's something interesting
[18:28:12] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: it was the pilot movie
[18:28:38] <MootPoot> oh no Urchin[emacs] 
[18:28:40] <cth> Cryowolf, yes, I loved both.
[18:28:40] <MootPoot> what are you doing
[18:28:48] <MootPoot> are you getting me into an entire franchise
[18:28:53] <MootPoot> I dont think I can handle it

[18:29:44] <Cryowolf> Aldnoah Zero is like Code Geass Lite, the MC is calm, calculated, cold and a genius
[18:29:51] <MootPoot> cth: if that's the case then I dont think you'll find much anime to cater to your likings - ah well, all the best to you
[18:30:18] <Cryowolf> but he does flinch a bit at romantic approaches cause he's not used to them, however there's no stereotype "AAAAAH HELP THERE'S BOOBS IN THE ROOM"
[18:30:30] <cth> MootPoot, yeah, I realize that 90% of it is not for me. I'm fine. It's still more than normal TV shows.

[18:42:41] <Cryowolf> the most recent ones tend to become dubbed though, but if you look years back then you can't find proper dubs
[18:42:47] <Berlin36> yeah
[18:42:55] <Berlin36> naruto dub in russian is fucking cringe
[18:43:02] <Berlin36> well that's how i remember it
[18:43:11] <ezekielnoob> Sadale probably not in our lifetime
[18:43:13] <Berlin36> so because of that, i watched with subtitles
[18:43:22] <cth> Cryowolf, I realize I'm limiting myself, but I don't have the time to read anime. 
[18:43:33] <Berlin36> r- read anime?
[18:43:52] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Interesting. That's actually something that I'd worry about xD
[18:43:55] <Berlin36> i guess MootPoot enjoys russian hardbass now
[18:43:59] <darkwitch> it sounded like you don't even watch anime
[18:43:59] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Mainly because PH is an island nation.
[18:44:05] <Berlin36> is enjoying*
[18:44:12] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, and the government may lack the money for dealing with that.
[18:44:12] <darkwitch> that anime is simply used like background music

[18:56:55] <ImoutoBot> [title] Powering Arduino With a Battery (with Pictures) - Instructables
[18:57:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, That's because he's feeding the power via the vin pin.
[18:58:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, powering via the Vin pin is the same as powering it via the DC jack. And yes, that jack does require higher voltage. But you could just power it via USB instead of the jack/Vin.
[18:58:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: why not use a USB power bank?
[18:58:28] <darkwitch> something smaller than a bay but still an area where water sort of does a curve inland
[18:58:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just so you know, some of the content in Instructables aren't written by professionals. So the content inside isn't always correct. That said reading it content should get you to somewhere.

[19:00:34] <MootPoot> that's it
[19:00:46] <MootPoot> I'm going to make an armoured mars rover that dosen't go to mars so its sad
[19:00:50] <MootPoot> I've decided
[19:01:08] <darkwitch> what is the inlet they are talking about though
[19:01:15] <MootPoot> darkwitch: the butthole
[19:01:34] <darkwitch> there is no hole MootPoot
[19:02:11] <MootPoot> oh wait
[19:02:24] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I remember the last time I went I went Thu a bridge into an island of omiyage stores
[19:02:42] <MootPoot> Sadale:  I have a 5000 mah 3s ( 11.1v) lipo
[19:02:44] <MootPoot> will that work
[19:03:02] <MootPoot> 55 watt hours and rated for 55C discharge
[19:03:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, again why not just use USB power bank? It's far safer this way
[19:03:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, anyway I guess your lipo should work.
[19:04:01] <MootPoot> Becasue I have bunch of batteries - and also I want to use the batteries for other things
[19:04:03] <Sadale> Don't get the connections wrong tho or you can break the Arduino
[19:04:12] <MootPoot> my arduino has no usb input
[19:04:13] <Sadale> ah. That's why
[19:04:14] <darkwitch> hey amigojapan, will you buy lots of omiyage this time?
[19:04:17] <Sadale> wut?
[19:04:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, which Arduino yo've got?
[19:04:39] <amigojapan> darkwitch: only for a couple of people
[19:05:17] <amigojapan> darkwitch: like the person who is our voucher for our apartment rent
[19:05:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, I think yours is Arduino Uno isn't it? If it's Arduino Uno there is a USB port. It's just in an unusual form-factor.
[19:05:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, if it isn't Arduino Uno the lipo may not even work. Please let me know which variant you've got so that I could check what voltage it accepts.

[20:59:18] <MootPoot> In terms of pure performance - what's the difference between a raspi 4 and a celeron J4125
[20:59:19] *** Quits: darkwitch (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:02:37] <Sadale> intel's far more powerful than rpi
[21:03:11] <MootPoot> doubling the price gets me a J4125 vs 100 for a rpi
[21:03:34] <Sadale> the computational power of raspi is actually rather weak. It's even weaker than most modern mid-end smartphones.
[21:03:40] <Sadale> However, J4125 takes more power.
[21:03:50] <Sadale> raspberry pi is good for its power efficiency and its compact size.
[21:04:33] <MootPoot> well, I'm going to use like
[21:04:38] <MootPoot> 40kg of batteries so
[21:04:44] <Sadale> so that's a trade off. If you're running it 24/7, the power consumption can actually eat up your money.
[21:04:47] <MootPoot> I dont think power is a problem lol
[21:04:59] <Sadale> I know. But power is a hidden cost.
[21:04:59] <MootPoot> also electricity costs basically nothing here
[21:05:06] <Sadale> nah. Do your math.
[21:05:10] <MootPoot> I did
[21:05:15] <Sadale> fair enough
[21:05:24] <MootPoot> running a 1500w AC unit here 24/7 like I do
[21:05:31] <MootPoot> costs me about an extra 15 dollars a month
[21:05:35] <MootPoot> price of a mcdonalds meal
[21:05:51] <Sadale> that's actually a lot if you do it for years
[21:06:15] <Sadale> never mind. You're talking about the AC unit. Not the J4125
[21:06:20] <MootPoot> yeah but I only need it for like 1/3 the year
[21:06:26] <MootPoot> oh lol
[21:06:38] <MootPoot> yeah the j4125 I doubt it'll take anything noticable
[21:06:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: my own PC eats like 1000w on its own
[21:06:49] <Sadale> I've actually thought about getting intel-based board. But I ended up sticking with raspi because it takes less power. :/
[21:07:04] <Sadale> MootPoot, No way that'd be the idle power consumption
[21:07:08] <MootPoot> no, thats load
[21:07:19] <Sadale> you rich. That's a beefy computer
[21:07:21] <MootPoot> idle is like 350-400w
[21:07:36] <MootPoot> Sadale: I'm running a 5900x with a 3080 and 64g of ram with triple 4k displays
[21:07:48] <MootPoot> the monitors are 120-150 w each
[21:08:07] <MootPoot> Sadale: fortunately it doubles as an electric heater during the winter so nothing is wasted
[21:08:30] <Sadale> nice :3
[21:09:53] <Sadale> BTW, computer power supply takes around 30W~50W when idle.
[21:10:33] <Sadale> Meanwhile raspberry pi 3 takes only up to 10W at full load. raspi 4 maybe 15W at full load. At idle it barely takes any power :3
[21:11:26] <Sadale> So using intel one would cost extra 29kWh per month. It can add up.
[21:11:38] <Sadale> (assuming that you're running it 24/7, which may not be the case)
[21:11:45] <MootPoot> hmm
[21:11:52] <MootPoot> even a 1000w gold unit?
[21:12:04] <MootPoot> gold should be 94% efficient right?
[21:12:05] <Sadale> not so sure. You really need a kill-a-walt to measure the idle power consumption
[21:12:15] <Sadale> only at certain load. At low load I'm not so sure.
[21:12:33] <Sadale> damn. come to think of it I should have purchased a more efficient power supply for my superlaptop
[21:12:40] <Sadale> I just cheaped out on this one without putting much thoughts on it
[21:13:59] <MootPoot> I just bought a 10 pack of those tiny chiense servos

[23:08:12] <Bco1981> the first page
[23:08:38] <Nanobot> I never use that page. And OtakMori isn't showing up there.
[23:08:51] <Bco1981> ah
[23:09:00] <Nanobot> OtakMori shows up in search results for hololive and as recommended videos on video pages.
[23:09:16] <Nanobot> I want it gone from both places
[23:10:08] <Nanobot> I've Googled ways to block YouTube channels, and all the discussion has basically said that it's impossible. YouTube doesn't let you actually block channels, and they ignore your "don't recommend me this" requests after about 24 hours.
[23:10:21] <Nanobot> There are extensions, but they apparently break constantly.
[23:10:57] <Bco1981> hm
[23:11:10] <Nanobot> You can "block a channel" as in prevent them from commenting on your own videos. But that's it.

[23:12:54] <Nanobot> Is she talking about Applebee's again?
[23:14:10] <Bco1981> no, a previous job she worked at. you might have heard this part, if you watched the whole stream
[23:14:23] <Bco1981> then it turns into sizes talk.
[23:15:50] <Nanobot> I tuned in around when they started talking about eating fish semen.
