[02:02:20] <seninha> Hello, I'm doing this exercise, and I developed this solution that, although I'm confident it satisfies the exercise itself, I'm not sure whether it satisfies the challenge. https://0x0.st/-R5-.txt

[02:12:18] <h_m> the only way to really know if it satisfies the challenge is to submit the solution as is, and wait for it to be marked. if you get all marks for it, then it was correct. unless you want folk here to mark the homework for you so you pretend to your professor that you indeed mastered the challenge
[02:13:33] <seninha> it's not homework. I'm reading sicp and it's one of the exercises of the book
[02:14:26] <seninha> I'm checking other people solution but none of the solutions I checked was like mine.
[02:15:04] <h_m> test your solution as well as theirs on the test cases.
[02:17:59] <h_m> if they all pass, then your question might be understanding how they differ

[15:54:03] <amazigh> ty :D

[15:54:23] <rgherdt> how was the experience with spock?
[15:54:38] *** Joins: Inline (~Inline@2a02:908:1252:7a80:4744:6074:ea58:ae8a)
[15:55:12] <amazigh> There is few minor annoyances.
[15:55:40] <amazigh> The main missing bit is source maps, to be able to tell in the browser console, where the problem is in scheme source.
[15:57:38] <rgherdt> I see
[15:58:59] <amazigh> also figure how to call javascript functions was most of the time I spent with spock.
[15:59:04] <amazigh> s/figure/figuring/
[15:59:50] <amazigh> the advantage compared to biwascheme is that it supports call/cc and tail calls.
[16:00:04] <rgherdt> BTW, I think CHICKEN deserves an entry under "JavaScript FFI" then :)
[16:00:11] <amazigh> error messages with biwascheme are not much better.
[16:00:47] <amazigh> I do not know, because that is not really chicken, afaik you can not use chicken's eggs.
[16:01:00] <amazigh> I mean, spock is another implementation.
[16:01:08] <rgherdt> you're right
[16:01:11] <amazigh> so I guess, spock deserve its own entry in the comparator.
[16:03:39] <mario-goulart> I think the bar on the number of questions tagged in stackoverflow is too high. :-)

[16:04:14] <Franciman> hi, what do you think of guix?

[16:06:20] <Franciman> takk
[16:06:57] <amazigh> one very great feature is the ability ot create a docker OR a tarball with all the required dependencies (shared libs etc..)
[16:08:34] <amazigh> I do not if there is an easy to also do the same thing with several POSIX process, it should be doable, also guix has its own PID 1 called sheperd (systemd alternative)
[16:08:44] *** Joins: Everything (~Everythin@37.115.210.35)
[16:09:16] <amazigh> basically the tarball, let you run package programs on another distro. It is a supeprset of the feature of e.g. chez-exe
[16:10:09] <amazigh> another major feature, is the ability to rollback the machine configuration from grub

[20:32:13] <amazigh> I investigated how to build something like nixos / guix but on top of an existing distro, with the goal to replicate the guix feature that allows to create a tarball with all the requires files to run a file on the same architecture as the host but possibly on another distro that is also glibc based.
[20:32:39] <amazigh> but I am not sure why I did that, except it is interesting and could be useful.

[20:35:21] <amazigh> we could use that tool, that i dubbed scheme-algebraish, as a test bed to see what is missing to build portable program... and also use it to make benchmarks easy to reproduce.
[20:35:59] <amazigh> scheme-algrebraish would be portable across scheme implementations, and it should make it possible to compile any scheme..

[20:36:30] <amazigh> ... with their existing toolchain. scheme-algebraish is a package manager!
[20:37:25] <amazigh> Anyway, to proceed one needs to go through linux from scratch book; then investigate how to make the tarball, I mean the binaries are relocatable, so one may use patchelf tool or build the .so binaries to use relative paths
[20:38:27] <amazigh> pathelf would be used after a build in a chroot env, where relative path should be done at build time

[20:54:14] *** X-Scale` is now known as X-Scale
[20:54:15] <amazigh> Another (cheap) idea I have in mind is building a forge such as sourcehut, but majestic modular monolith design instead.
[21:07:05] <wasamasa> modular monolith
[21:07:12] <wasamasa> you mean like, gitea?

[21:08:16] <sham1> Modular monolith sounds very oxymoronic
[21:09:07] <amazigh> many people think that monolith necessarly means spagethi code.
[21:09:28] <amazigh> that's why I (and others) add modular in front of monolith.
[21:09:44] <amazigh> gitea but with portable scheme code :D
[21:09:56] <amazigh> and mailing list support.

[21:12:11] <wasamasa> portable scheme, uhuh
[21:12:18] <wasamasa> however you're gonna do this
[21:13:41] <amazigh> I am just blowing steam... lassi is not around to upscale the convo
[21:13:49] <amazigh> a portable civkit for the win!!!!1
[21:15:18] <sham1> Portable Scheme is like herding cats
[21:16:20] * amazigh checks what herding cats is...
[21:16:32] <amazigh> hu! oh! ah1!
[21:17:30] <amazigh> As far as I know, most of the other PL i know were built by handful of people
[21:17:47] <amazigh> here i see... one, two, three nicknames. That's is enough :)
[21:18:06] <amazigh> let's get started
[21:18:08] <amazigh> !

[21:19:50] <amazigh> more seriously, I feel over confident because I wrote a 200 SLOC webapp
[21:20:03] <amazigh> that is very strange, but I will ride that happyness nonetheless :)
[21:21:00] <amazigh> I have a better idea, we create a scheme algebra, then we generate alternative implementations of many common libraries, to make it looks like scheme is mainstream
[21:21:40] <amazigh> I mean, you can't reach TOP3 TIOBE index without at least five libraries doing the same thing in slightly different ways, and more or less good naming convention.
