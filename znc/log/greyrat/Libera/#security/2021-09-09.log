[01:20:18] <Hash> If the have the hash and the salt, can't they generate tables?
[01:20:33] <ajak> yes, but that takes a ton of time
[01:20:48] <ajak> (for most people, anyway)
[01:21:09] <ajak> the benefit of having a rainbow table is that it's pregenerated, so if you get hashes you can potentially crack them
[01:21:28] <ajak> if you get salted hashes your rainbow table is useless and you'll have to generate a rainbow table *per hash*
[01:21:31] <Hash> But if you have the salt, that defeats the salting, right?
[01:21:36] <ajak> no
[01:21:59] *** Quits: darksun (~darksun@user/darksun) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[01:22:02] <Hash> Ok, so wait for example my mind is slowly getting this
[01:22:03] <ajak> because your rainbow table(s) are already going to be useless, since you'd have to regenerate them based on the salt
[01:22:03] *** Joins: bitmega (~bitmega@user/bitmega)

[01:23:29] <Hash> Because everytime they login, i'll have to check against the salt, hash it, and check against the value in the db
[01:24:01] <Hash> So where would I store the salt. Because if someone can break in and get the hashed passwords, and the salts, they can generate the rainbow tables for that user account for that hash
[01:24:34] <Hash> Oh you're saying they'll have to generate a table for each user's salt. I see where it would make it difficult but not impossible.
[01:25:01] <Hash> So the question, how do you come up with a good salt, (you said /dev/random) and where would you securely store it in the db for daily use?
[01:26:21] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life_ (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[01:26:31] <Hash> Or perhaps you don't even store the salt, but it's a 'derived' value based on perhaps username or email or something else
[01:27:07] <Hash> Because if you get a value from /dev/random, it will be a concrete value and you'd have to store it somewhere.

[01:28:05] <Hash> So unless they know your code and how you're doing it, access to the db would not result in them being able to break the passwords because they would have no idea what the salt is. Guessing the salt would be a challenge

[01:28:51] <Hash> Is my thinking okay or do you see any problems in how I'm thinking about this?
[01:29:00] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[01:29:04] <richard_h> I'm no expert, but I think the normal idea is to generate a random salt, per password, and store it with the password hash
[01:29:30] <ajak> yes, just like /etc/shadow
[01:29:54] <Hash> I see. I think my mind sees an issue with this because it still stores the salt in plaintext in the db, the hacker can view the salt, and use it to genrte targerated rainbow tables for an account.
[01:30:10] <Hash> Perhaps it is because I yet do not know enough
[01:30:15] <richard_h> a rainbow table for a single account is just a brute force attack
[01:30:20] <Hash> Right
[01:30:27] <ajak> they can generate a targetted rainbow table
[01:30:38] <richard_h> the idea of a rainbow table is to generate it once, and use it to attack many accounts
[01:30:52] <Hash> Correct, so the goal in my mind is to even hide the salt.
[01:31:04] *** Joins: sym (symmetry@user/sym)
[01:31:04] <ajak> hopefully in the couple years(?) it takes to generate a rainbow table that specific password doesn't matter anymore
[01:31:21] <Hash> Not store it plaintext, but when the salt needs to be used, have it be a derived value and not store it anywhere. Still unique, but reliably determined from other values instead of being stored.
[01:32:03] <ajak> that's probably as good as it being stored in plaintext
[01:32:06] <richard_h> if you can derive the salt, so can someone else who knows your algorithm (which if it's open source software, is anyone)
[01:32:49] <Hash> Close source stuff where they can't see your code.
[01:32:59] <richard_h> and that means you could create a rainbow table mapping from (user,hash) pairs to passwords
[01:33:12] <richard_h> security by obscurity not recommended
[01:33:28] <Hash> not entirely, no
[01:33:42] <Hash> But if they can't see something, it makes it harder for them to do anything about it.
[01:33:52] <richard_h> if your db can leak (which is what you're protecting against), then maybe so can your code
[01:33:58] <Hash> obscurity is not security entirely, but it is a useful layer.
[01:34:20] <richard_h> but if the salt is random, then the issue goes away
[01:34:47] <Hash> consider camo in animals. Obscurity by natural design is security.
[01:35:02] <Hash> if predators cannot detect you, they cannot eat you.
[01:35:30] <richard_h> decidedly not secure against technologically advanced hunters :-)

[01:36:38] <Hash> if the salt is random, but stored in a db, and they can get into the db and see the salt and the hash, that's game over for someone dedicated enough to break it.
[01:36:53] <richard_h> in that case, they have to brute force it
[01:37:04] <Hash> So, against targeted attacks, I think not storing the salt at all is good. Just make it a derived value still random and unique.
[01:37:34] <Hash> But if they know only the hash, and you do not store the salt, they can't brute it. They have no idea what the salt it.
[01:37:52] <Hash> So that makes brute/targeted rainbow useless
[01:38:00] <ajak> if you don't store the salt then you can't use the salt
[01:38:27] <Hash> Sure you can. You can derive the salt from other values of the user data that attacker has no idea about as he can't see your code.
[01:38:43] <Hash> He won't know how the unique salt is generted.
[01:38:58] <ajak> that's still stored, just stored literally with extra steps
[01:39:03] <Hash> Only your code can reliably use it becauase you know how you're determinging the unique salt.
[01:39:21] <richard_h> you hope you're the only one who knows that
[01:39:37] <Hash> Right. But it's an additional layer. Say your code is compiled and private and not open source you know
[01:40:13] <richard_h> but it reduces the size of the set of possible salts (I'm sure there's a better term for that)
[01:40:21] <Hash> It probably does.
[01:40:31] <Hydragyrum> or if you derive it from values that the attacker can't easily access -- i.e. unchanging hardware or system values, such as the root filesystem UUID

[01:42:06] <Hydragyrum> but often restoring from backups you have UUID issues, since typically fstab and bootloader use UUIDs
[01:42:21] <richard_h> An alternative: generate a random unique value, hash it with some secret in your code, and use that as your salt
[01:42:35] <Hash> Yeah, something like that.
[01:42:42] <Hash> Great thinking
[01:43:20] <richard_h> I'm not sure how much it really gains - and it's probably still a reduced space compared with the original random value

[02:19:56] <Hash> Is there any reason for a webserver to have tls below 1.3 backward support?
[02:20:14] <Hash> if you keep tls 1.3 only does it restrict some browsers from accessing your site

[02:21:13] <Hash> So what should you do? 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 or 1.3 only?
[02:21:48] <ajak> it depends on what browsers you want to support

[04:16:19] <PrettyKittie> ^
[04:16:28] <PrettyKittie> its a naming service used by windows

[04:16:41] <PrettyKittie> roughly kinda like a local dns
[04:16:47] <PrettyKittie> and 445 is smb
[04:17:18] <PrettyKittie> most of those ctf type games are susceptible to eternal blue, if 445 is available
[04:17:35] <PrettyKittie> maybe give that a shot. theres a metasploit module for it.
[04:18:19] <ghostbuster> thanks
[04:19:05] <PrettyKittie> np
[04:19:07] <PrettyKittie> good luck
[04:19:40] <skill> yeah, also check if smbv1 is enabled. plenty of modules for it
[04:20:30] <PrettyKittie> ooh, good point ^
[04:22:21] <skill> i remember ms08-68 would be the patch. That was the patch that at least one box was missing in every windows env that I worked on.
[04:22:21] <ghostbuster> i guess i can just run metasploit modules until something works haha
[04:22:42] <ghostbuster> if port 139 is open does that mean smbv1 is enabled?
[04:22:53] <skill> ghostbuster: smb will also let you query the box for lots of information
[04:23:31] <ghostbuster> skill: i had a hunch that was the case, but i need to figure out how to ask politely :)

[08:38:20] <Hash> Hahaha
[08:38:27] <Hash> That is brilliant.
[08:38:48] <Hash> The operation marks US law enforcement’s latest attempt to circumvent encryption on smartphones. For years now, the FBI has been urging Apple to create a backdoor into its iPhones, citing the need to collect evidence against suspected criminals. Apple has thus far refused, so the agency has contracted professional smartphone hacking services to help it unlock devices seized in investigations.
[08:38:57] <Hash> With Anom, the FBI used an entirely different strategy to tackle the challenge of encryption. The genesis for the sting operation occurred with the FBI takedown of a separate encrypted chat platform popular among criminals called Phantom Secure.
[08:39:49] <WishBoy> IT'S A TRAP DUDE, RUN !
[08:42:03] <ghostbuster> that's the third encrypted phone sting I've heard about in the last 2 years

[08:42:45] <ghostbuster> "The F.B.I.’s operation, according to court documents that the Justice Department unsealed on Monday, had its origins in early 2018 after the bureau dismantled a Canadian-based encryption service called Phantom Secure. "

[12:11:06] <Hash> there was no online checking back then, they billed the cards later.
[12:11:22] <Hash> So they implemented new techniques, like certain prefixes were banned
[12:11:38] <Hash> certain 4-6 starting digits on credit card generators would be banend on aol
[12:11:54] <Hash> so you had to find specific prefixes that still worked, extrapoloate a real card or generate one

[12:12:13] <Hash> when aol got saturated, we moved to compuserve and prodigy networks
[12:12:27] <Hash> you could do all the same stuff there, and since it wasn't as popular as aol, not much security

[21:34:36] <ArticulateHacker> SSHD by default supports ssh-rsa, rsa-sha2-256, and rsa-sha2-512 (among others) for host key signature algorithms. I want to remove support for ssh-rsa because it uses SHA1. When I remove ssh-rsa from the HostKeyAlgorithms line in sshd_config it also removes rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512. Is there any way to remove only ssh-rsa?

[23:56:53] <Hash> flyback: so right now is probably not a good time to buy hdd. How about SSD?
[23:57:03] <flyback> dunno
[23:57:04] <Hydragyrum> ssd's are still not cheap
[23:57:27] <Hash> flyback: you doing alright? How's your health? How's dad?
[23:58:01] <Hydragyrum> hdd's are hovering around $20/tb last I checked, so it's not too bad if you have a reason to get storage now, but if it's for the future etc. then waiting is probably going to pay off

[23:59:24] <Hash> In 2009, I bought 2x 1001 FALS wd black drives, basically enterprise drives without the enterprise FW, 160$ each
[23:59:39] <Hash> Right now, I see similar pricing on wd gold (top tier drives)
[23:59:49] <Hash> 1tb for 140-150 buck. Sounds alright to me.
