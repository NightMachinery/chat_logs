[05:22:10] <vim_fans> " hence the term coprocessor joins accumulator and core memory as quaint terms that date the speaker"  what does " date the speaker" mean in this sentence?
[05:22:59] <CuriosTiger> "the person who is speaking"
[05:23:01] <Me-me> To "date" oneself is to demonstrate that you are writing in a specific period in the past. In this sentence it is showing how outdated those terms are.
[05:23:26] <CuriosTiger> Someone who is talking about "accumulator" and "core memory" is likely to be at least in their fifties, since that terminology is very outdated.
[05:24:27] <CuriosTiger> "Core memory" was used in mainframes and some minicomputers from the 1960s and early 1970s. Someone who uses those terms was likely introduced to computers that long ago.
[05:24:32] <furrykef> Me-me: Yeah, what CuriosTiger said. I don't think it's an American accent thing at all.
[05:24:44] <Me-me> It's something I've only noticed in americans.
[05:24:54] <CuriosTiger> Likewise, while modern computers have "accumulators", they are not discrete parts, but just an integral component of the CPU.
[05:25:58] <vim_fans> Me-me: CuriosTiger: your explanation is excellent   thanks 
[05:26:32] <CuriosTiger> vim_fans: No problem.

[05:37:47] <Torr> What does "with compliments of" means?
[05:41:31] <Me-me> More context, please.
[05:42:12] <CuriosTiger> It means you are receiving a gift from someone, basically.
[05:42:45] <Me-me> Or it might mean you're being literally complimented.
[05:42:52] <Me-me> It depends on the context.
[05:45:39] <Torr> Me-me: There's no context, it's from a preposition exercise.
[05:46:03] <Torr> Does "in compliments to" makes sense?
[05:46:12] <Me-me> I would say that that is a poorly-put-together excercise, then.
[05:46:24] <Me-me> But would otherwise assume what CuriosTiger said.
[05:48:12] <Torr> Like "I received this blade with compliments of Zeus", right?
[05:48:39] <Me-me> Yes, that is the sort of context it would exist in.

[06:11:33] <vim_fans> " The U.S Internal Revenue Service always rounds 0.50 dollars up. A more equitable way would be to round up this case half the time and round down the other half."  what does half the time mean in this statement ? 
[06:12:26] <CuriosTiger> 50%
[06:12:43] <Me-me> For half of the instances of rounding, the writer wants the IRS to round down, instead of up.
[06:13:04] <Me-me> "Half the time" meaning "half of the instances of rounding".
[06:17:41] <vim_fans> still puzzled  if the writer wants the IRS to round down, why there is "round down the other half"
[06:18:12] <CuriosTiger> they're suggesting that the IRS should round up 50% of the time and round down 50% of the time.
[06:18:26] <vim_fans> get it now 
[06:21:14] <kurahaupo1> At what points in which calculations does the IRS need rounding to whole dollars? 
[06:21:43] <CuriosTiger> They don't NEED it anywhere, but they do it on basically every field of the 1040 for simplicity.
[06:21:57] <CuriosTiger> at least, that has been my experience.
[06:22:33] <kurahaupo1> (every tax form I've ever seen - not in the US - has either "floor" to whole dollars, or simply the exact number of cents)
[06:22:41] <kurahaupo1> what's a 1040
[06:22:43] <kurahaupo1> ?
[06:22:55] <CuriosTiger> The 1040 is the tax form US residents file with the IRS.
[06:23:12] <CuriosTiger> and I guess I'm not surprised to hear it works differently from every other tax form.

[06:25:29] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo1: Partially.
[06:25:39] <CuriosTiger> You can also thank American distrust of the government
[06:25:39] <TimMc> I was so angry when TurboTax and friends successfully sued California to prevent them from automating state taxes.
[06:25:51] <CuriosTiger> lack of cooperation between federal agencies, and between federal and state authorities
[06:26:02] <kurahaupo1> wtf ... but I'm sadly not surprised
[06:26:07] <CuriosTiger> and just the ridiculous patchwork of there being 300,000 jurisdictions that you have to deal with to file your taxes.
[06:26:11] <TimMc> CuriosTiger: These are true as well.
[06:26:19] <CuriosTiger> it's a giant ridiculous mess.
[06:26:33] <CuriosTiger> and Inuit and friends wanting to protect their revenue is only part of it.
[06:26:41] <CuriosTiger> but certainly not a part to be ignored.
[06:27:02] <CuriosTiger> the biggest drawback to US citizenship is having to deal with that mess for life.
[06:27:04] <kurahaupo1> on what legal basis that that suit claim jurisdiction over the Californian tax dept?
[06:27:29] <TimMc> No idea.
[06:27:32] <kurahaupo1> I gather "stop filing tax returns" is the #1 reason for people repudiating US citizenship

[06:32:18] <CuriosTiger> Yes. Also, for rich people, "not paying taxes to the US" is a major motivator.
[06:32:54] <CuriosTiger> The US taxes citizens on worldwide income. There are some provisions to avoid dual taxation, but they only apply to approximately the first $100K worth of income, and they do not prevent dual taxation of capital gains.
[06:34:07] <kurahaupo1> That reminds me, I need to resubmit my non-resident-alien tax declaration to NASDAQ.
[06:34:53] <kurahaupo1> Otherwise uncle sam will kindly deduct 8% off my sale prices
[06:35:22] <kurahaupo1> (on the assumption that the entire price is capital gain unless I can prove otherwise)
[06:36:36] <kurahaupo1> In theory it's possible to claim it back, but I'd then have to file a US tax return, and probably pay most of it to TurboTax or HR Block

[20:14:57] <thinkdweller> this is the question
[20:15:02] <thinkdweller> the answer choices are below
[20:15:14] <thinkdweller> I have chosen a
[20:15:33] <thinkdweller> which one fits the right answer?
[20:15:43] <[itchyjunk]> It was called dantes inferno, I think.
[20:15:48] <huf> ah
[20:16:12] <[itchyjunk]> It was a hard read, I only got about 20 pages in.
[20:16:21] <huf> but wait, that's italian
[20:16:26] <thinkdweller> yes that's a hard to read book, even for the dante himself
[20:16:41] <[itchyjunk]> Oh, the one I was reading was in English.
[20:16:53] <huf> is that allowed?
[20:17:28] <blkshp> thinkdweller: which do you think it is?
[20:17:33] <huf> why not read milton's pair of dice lost?
[20:17:44] <thinkdweller> blkshp
[20:17:45] <thinkdweller> i chose A
[20:17:56] <blkshp> That's also what I would choose.
[20:18:55] <thinkdweller> blkshp but the damned system says it's B!
[20:19:26] <thinkdweller> blkshp just where in the text, does it mention Brazil having a rich history of soccer?
[20:19:35] <[itchyjunk]> I would say b.
[20:19:37] <blkshp> I would dispute that, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th paragraphs are specifically about Pele.
[20:19:58] <[itchyjunk]> it seems to be more about Brazil and it's love for soccer than just Pele.
[20:20:02] <blkshp> It's one of them that's a matter of opinion
[20:20:12] <blkshp> the question is poorly written anyway.
[20:20:25] <[itchyjunk]> Pele is a subtopic contained within the idea of Brazils love for soccer.
[20:20:31] <blkshp> Pele dazzled crowds with his Cup player had brought him to the tryout.
[20:20:32] <huf> the text is badly written too
[20:20:38] <blkshp> That's not even a sentence.
[20:21:01] <[itchyjunk]> That might have to do with how it was copy pasted though.
[20:21:04] <blkshp> The first use of "Football" should not be capitalised.
[20:21:17] <thinkdweller> so can I have my call to my master about it being wrong?
[20:21:29] <thinkdweller> I mean, do you guys think that it's more about Pele?
[20:21:34] <[itchyjunk]> Not me.
[20:21:40] <[itchyjunk]> I would have picked b.
[20:21:42] <blkshp> I think it's both but ambiguous.
[20:21:44] <thinkdweller> [itchyjunk] what is your reason?
[20:21:58] <[itchyjunk]> The context talks about more than just Pele.
[20:22:05] <blkshp> I think there's no specifically correct answer and "wrong" is not accurate.
[20:22:07] <[itchyjunk]> Also mentions Brazil has won without Pele too.
[20:22:36] <[itchyjunk]> I might have expected an "all of the above" type answer in this type of scenario.
[20:22:57] <[itchyjunk]> But the main idea I got out of it was Brazil loves football.
[20:23:52] <thinkdweller> so brazil loves football, but nowhere in the text it mentioned brazil having rich history in football?
[20:24:06] <[itchyjunk]> Kids playing it, many soccer leagues, enlisting 16 year olds, excitement over World Cup in general.
[20:24:14] <[itchyjunk]> All those ideas transcend Pele.
[20:24:39] <[itchyjunk]> It does. It talks about Pele winning in 1958.
[20:24:54] <[itchyjunk]> Followed by other dates.
[20:25:13] <[itchyjunk]> So they have decades upon decades of playing and winning prestigious awards in this sports.
[20:25:28] <[itchyjunk]> Even international recognition, since a foreign newspapers is mentioned.
[20:25:49] <thinkdweller> yea but that doesn't count as " history "
[20:26:00] <huf> what
[20:26:03] <[itchyjunk]> Points to a rich history of playing this sports.
[20:26:13] <[itchyjunk]> At least to me.
[20:26:15] <thinkdweller> for example, we can say that ancient people played a football in Africa, and this is history
[20:26:19] <[itchyjunk]> As mentioned, this is quite subjective.
[20:26:24] <thinkdweller> and one thing
[20:26:31] <huf> thinkdweller: history doesnt have to be ancient
[20:26:51] <thinkdweller> hmmmm
[20:26:53] <thinkdweller> thank you so much
[20:27:04] <huf> stuff that happened in 1999 is history
[20:27:13] <[itchyjunk]> Right, "rich history" to me means that it's not a new fad or somesuch.
[20:27:19] <huf> those primitive tribesmen believed in y2k
[20:27:28] <huf> it was some kind of evil spirit, as far as we can make out
[20:27:43] <thinkdweller> [itchyjunk] yes I'm saying that
[20:27:46] <velix> Anyone with an answer for me? :D
[20:28:02] <huf> velix: no, it's fine

[22:56:44] <LjL> they are different parts of speech, and mean vaguely related but also quite different things
[22:57:28] <LjL> wholesome is an adjective, and means that something is healthy or "good for you" or morally good perhaps
[22:58:05] <LjL> entirety (not entirity) is a noun, you can say "the entirety of the population has been vaccinated", meaning everyone has been
[22:58:14] <spinningCat> sorry for typo
[22:58:18] <LjL> "overall" is an adverb, and you can say "overall, these words are similar but different"

[23:01:08] <GuiToris> ok, we discussed 'stuck' (I'm still not confident with it). Now I have questions about 'suck'
[23:01:20] <GuiToris> It sucks <- this must be ok, I heard this
[23:01:39] <GuiToris> so if I dislike more than one things, will it be : those suck?
[23:05:21] <spinningCat> that sucks
[23:05:39] <spinningCat> you can use that for plural this for singular
[23:06:00] <inhahe_> spinningCat: instead of wholesome, wholly maybe what you want
[23:06:08] <spinningCat> i guess "those" is ok too but i generally heard that sucks or that suck
[23:06:41] <GuiToris> as clear as mud
[23:07:01] <inhahe_> you could say those suck
[23:07:07] <inhahe_> or they suck
[23:07:30] <inhahe_> 'that' and 'this' refer to singulars
[23:08:32] <GuiToris> what I also didn't find in the dictionary; if I'm not good at something: I ?am? suck ?at? something   ???
[23:08:38] <spinningCat> i think it depends on you use suck with s or without s i am not native btw
[23:09:12] <inhahe_> GuiToris: you could say "i suck at that"
[23:09:24] <GuiToris> so no -be- at all
[23:09:26] <GuiToris> thank you
[23:12:01] <spinningCat> i suck at that sounds like very informal way to say that
[23:12:32] <inhahe_> yeah
[23:12:33] <spinningCat> if you are somewhere full of people with suits that one may be taken as rude
[23:12:47] <spinningCat> or university or some meeting etc.
[23:13:00] <LjL> <spinningCat> you can use that for plural this for singular ← that's not at all the difference between "this" and "that"
[23:13:07] <GuiToris> it doesn't sound profane
[23:13:44] <LjL> "this" is something either physically close to you, or that you're talking about, or that you recently talked about; "that" is something physically close to the person you're talking to, or not close to you, or that the person you're talking to has mentioned, or that you mentioned but more distantly than "this"
[23:13:46] <spinningCat> LjL,  well probably you may know better
[23:13:51] <spinningCat> !w profane
[23:13:51] <LjL> it doesn't have to do with singular or plural
[23:13:53] <tinsoldier> profane — Noun: 1. A person or thing that is profane., 2. (Freemasonry) A person not a Mason., — Verb: 1. (transitive) To violate (something sacred); to treat with abuse, irreverence, obloquy, or contempt; to desecrate, 2. (transitive) To put to a wrong or unworthy use; to debase; to abuse; to defile., — Adjective: 1. Unclean; ritually impure; unho <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/profane>...
[23:14:45] <LjL> "those suck" is correct for plural, although when you're just talking about a bunch of things that someone mentioned that you think suck, "that sucks" can often be fine, not because it's plural, but just because you're taking the various things as a set
[23:14:50] <spinningCat> LjL,  yeah i know that aspect of this and that
[23:15:31] <LjL> "I suck at that" is very informal but also very common
[23:15:50] <LjL> it's an idiomatic way to say you're bad at something, but not one you'd use with people you aren't too familiar with
[23:16:06] <LjL> spinningCat, well, it's the only aspect :P
[23:16:49] <LjL> if something is plural, "these" and "those" are the plural of "this" and "that". it may be possible to use "this" and "that" for collective entities, but there is no singular/plural difference between "this" *and* "that"
[23:17:16] <GuiToris> LjL, Can I use it in the company of religious people?
[23:17:29] <spinningCat> LjL,  I see
[23:17:37] <LjL> GuiToris, if you aren't sure, the safe answer is "no"
[23:18:06] <GuiToris> get it, thanks :)
[23:18:10] <LjL> also a good rule of thumb is... listen to what other people are saying, and if they say it, then probably so can you (this isn't necessarily true with other languages)
[23:18:47] <inhahe_> religious people have nothing against 'sucks' that i know of
[23:19:07] <LjL> they may tend to be a little more uptight about language in general than non-religious people, in my experience
[23:19:07] <GuiToris> I heard this phrase from Linus
[23:19:12] <LjL> but yeah it's nearly orthogonal

[23:31:22] <TimMc> GuiToris: I think you can replace that meaning of "to suck" with "to be bad".
[23:31:46] <TimMc> (including "bad at")
[23:32:21] <GuiToris> it's also 'suck at', then right?
[23:32:54] <GuiToris> I don't quite understand why you emphasized 'at' there :/
[23:34:20] <spinningCat> at is preposition
[23:34:35] <spinningCat> i guess that is embedded to adj like that
[23:34:51] <TimMc> "to be bad" and "to be bad at" have distinct meanings
[23:35:01] <GuiToris> oh I see
[23:35:11] <GuiToris> I didn't realize this
[23:35:12] <GuiToris> thank you
[23:35:18] <TimMc> Intrinsically shitty, vs. unskilled at some task.
[23:36:05] <TimMc> suck/suck at has essentially the same pair of meanings
