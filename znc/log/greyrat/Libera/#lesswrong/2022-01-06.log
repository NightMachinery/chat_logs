[01:34:38] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The latest effort emerged last month, when Stanford, UC-Berkeley and UC-San Francisco jointly announced the launch of ARC Institute. Funded with $650 million from an odd lot of individual investors, including Ethereum billionaire Vitalik Buterin, the institute will give 10 to 15 core investigators eight years of funding to build 10to 20-person labs and pursue whatever
[01:34:39] <feepbot> biological research they choose. Silvana Konermann Focused on complex diseases, it will also host collaborations with the three universities and house five ‚Äútechnology centers‚Äù dedicated to advancing broadly applicable technologies such as new gene editing tools and new animal models for understanding basic biology and human diseases. If successful, it would essentially build a
[01:34:39] <feepbot> platform of powerful tools and recruit a bunch of minds that can set those on a range on cancer or neurodegeneration, without worrying about developing a product or getting the next grant, said Stanford professor Silvana Konermann, one of the co-founders. UC-Berkeley professor Patrick Hsu, who founded the institute with Konermann and Stripe co-founder and billionaire Patrick
[01:34:44] <feepbot> Collison, said they designed ARC to overcome several common frustrations for biomedical researchers. They hope, for example, that promising academics can collaborate and pursue their biggest goals without worrying or wasting months applying for NIH grants, or needing to publish a steady stream of results in a top journal. ‚ÄúWe are betting on people, not projects,‚Äù he said. The
[01:34:44] <feepbot> trio asked what happens if they revisited the university model ‚Äúto some degree, from first principles,‚Äù Hsu said. How could ‚Äú(we) establish an incentive structure that creates the kind of culture we want?‚Äù

[05:35:39] <kuudes> yes. what do you need the result for?

[05:36:03] <kuudes> yes, but why that?
[05:36:22] <spxtr> if I don't then I can go back to work immediately after symptoms go away
[05:36:30] <spxtr> if I do then I have to wait 10 days
[05:37:01] <kuudes> couldn't you just assume it is covid?
[05:37:24] <kuudes> I mean, something like 1% of the world is currently getting covid each day
[05:37:47] <spxtr> I assume it is covid and am acting as such, but I need a test result before I can go back to work
[05:39:24] <kuudes> but if you wait 10 days post-symptoms?
[05:39:46] <spxtr> then idk
[05:40:20] <kuudes> I mean, feel free to take tests if you need, but; priors are that you currently are covid positive, and tests likely will run out for a while
[05:40:40] <spxtr> we get testing for free at stanford, just have to drop a thing in a drop box
[05:40:47] <kuudes> also if you are covid negative and go to work, then you will likely get infected that day
[05:40:49] <spxtr> they're a couple days behind though
[05:41:04] <kuudes> presumably they will run out of tests soon as well
[05:41:15] <spxtr> my lab only has like 5 people working there regularly, no others with symptoms
[05:41:23] <kuudes> there just likely is not enough reagent to make new tests when the world gets ill at the same time

[05:46:34] <ggreer> oh yeah if you extrapolate naively
[05:47:53] <PlanckWalk> Obviously there's a spectrum of both susceptibility and exposure from unvaccinated retail worker to boosted hermit, but it's hard to tell how that will shape the curve.
[05:48:07] <ggreer> but at some point the disease can't find anyone else to infect, either because people lock down voluntarily or because everyone's immune
[05:48:39] <PlanckWalk> So yeah, a lot of trees will narrow and peter out, but how long that takes is hard to tell.
[05:48:46] <PlanckWalk> trees of transmission that is
[05:49:23] <nshepperd2> i expect that people won't lock down voluntarily hard enough
[05:50:12] <PlanckWalk> Definitely.  It seems pretty likely to infect 50% of the population, but nobody will ever know really how many.
[05:50:20] <PlanckWalk> >50% rather
[05:50:56] <ggreer> I assume this happens all the time with colds and stuff. we just don't notice because we don't have the testing infrastructure in place

[08:55:42] <saturn2> WSL is essentially a VM, but this seems more like wine
[08:57:15] <saturn2> what macOS software would i want to run on linux?
[08:57:35] <PapuaHardyNet> wine is very janky. I loved playing Skyrim through wine on Linux, but man, every major update of wine, I had something that would cause me to have to redo setting up things so I could play
[08:58:14] <PapuaHardyNet> I gave up gaming a few months ago, and man, the joy of not having to configure wine for games is a weight lifted off of my spine
[08:58:37] <PapuaHardyNet> s/gaming/gaming using Windows native games (I still play gzdoom with native linux binaries)/
[08:59:20] <PapuaHardyNet> "just works" is very underrated, and I can understand Obormot's desire for it
[08:59:43] <PapuaHardyNet> ((but to be fair, wine + jankiness >>>>>>> using native windows))
[09:00:03] <saturn2> there are wine "distros" where they do the work for you
[09:00:58] <PapuaHardyNet> that's like using kubernetes because you can't figure out how to use pip
[09:01:14] <PapuaHardyNet> bad idea imo
[09:01:33] <PapuaHardyNet> (although good idea if you have an nvidia gpu)
[09:01:34] <saturn2> i don't think that analogy makes any sense
[09:02:02] <PapuaHardyNet> let me correct myself, obviously I need some coffee
[09:02:14] <PapuaHardyNet> that is like using docker, when you cannot figure out how to use virtualenv
[09:02:20] <PapuaHardyNet> is that better?
[09:07:50] <saturn2> i'm talking about things like lutris or playonlinux

[10:36:15] <ggreer> because someone made a dumb comment that got downvoted?
[10:43:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, because HN is chock-full of these sorts of comment exchanges where people will compete with each other to see who can be the most meta, the most big-brain contrarian take, the most insight-porn-esque clever, and eeeveryone loves posting things like "that's because <some bullshit they came up with on the spot>", where they "disagree" with people (but not really) *just* to take an opportunity to show how smart they are
[10:44:34] <capisce> I've noticed this too
[10:44:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the thing is - people sometimes do the whole "more meta than thou" thing on Less Wrong, too. It's an impulse that people like us have. But on LW, for all its faults, there's the cultural understanding that doing that sort of thing for its own sake is not actually useful or interesting or truth-tracking. If you do it gratuitously on LW, people will be like "but is that actually true though", and if it's not - they'll be
[10:44:57] <Obormot\Arcturus>  like "yeah, nah dude", and downvote you, and move on
[10:45:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> And also, on LW, people - mostly! not always, but mostly! - will say they agree with you if they actually agree, and say they disagree if they actually disagree. (It seems banal, but it's a rare thing!)
[10:46:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> On HN - nah. It's wall to wall IQ+contrarianness signaling.
[10:48:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And, of course, there's the phenomenon - also present, though thankfully in *much* smaller quantities - that n-gate called "incorrecting each other", where people with *no domain expertise or knowledge or understanding* of some topic will jump in to "correct" other people with dumb shit - and, of course, they'll do it with the utter confidence that they know what's up, even if their "knowledge" comes *at best* from perusing a

[22:07:40] <ggreer> also amusing is australia now bragging about their low total death rates instead of their low case rates
[22:08:55] <ggreer> their original plan was for approximately nobody in australia to get covid. they shut down everything and trampled over everyone's rights (including the right to leave the country) while they waited for vaccine rollout. but even after that they didn't stop with the lockdowns
[22:10:03] <ggreer> honestly the reason australia has a low death rate is because they're an island nation and their outbreak started in the summer. only island nations can get illegal immigration low enough to prevent cases coming in
[22:12:03] <ggreer> had the US government tried to implement australia's policies, it would have been absolute chaos. people would revolt. also it wouldn't work because thousands sneak into the country every month. some of them would have covid

[22:28:10] <two2thehead> and somebody else has three, and somebody else has five. Interesting, we didn't really expect to see so much of that.

[22:38:19] <kuudes> pre-omicron infections do not give protection regarding omicron
[22:38:27] <two2thehead> ggreer, what gwern says mons pubis, underground pubis
[22:38:31] <ggreer> yeah they do
[22:38:34] <kuudes> especially against getting infected or infecting others
[22:38:35] <two2thehead> or whatever the correct latin phrase is
[22:38:42] <ggreer> not as much as for earlier versions of covid, but it still helps
[22:38:44] <kuudes> they give protection against hospitalization to some extent
[22:38:47] <two2thehead> pompy bompy
[22:38:50] <kuudes> nearly 0
[22:39:14] <kuudes> vaccinations give protection; they also are reduced, but they still have nonzero effect
[22:39:21] <kuudes> past infections have about 0 effect
[22:40:05] <ggreer> that makes no sense. infection causes your body to create antibodies and memory cells for lots of different parts of the virus. vaccination gives you antibodies and memory cells for the spike protein
[22:40:42] <kuudes> those antibodies are wrong kind
[22:40:47] <kuudes> omicron bypasses them
[22:40:53] <kuudes> that is why it also bypasses plasma meds
[22:41:10] <kuudes> (it has been trained on them but not on t-cells one could presume)
[22:41:40] <kuudes> t-cells are effective against serious illness, aka hospitalization
[22:41:45] <kuudes> because they come in effect so late
[22:41:55] <kuudes> antibodies are effective against infection
[22:42:02] <ggreer> ok so infection gives you antibodies for the spike protein and many other proteins on the surface of the virus. vaccination gives you antibodies for the spike protein. how is it possible for vaccination to be superior?
[22:42:10] <kuudes> thats the data
[22:42:34] <kuudes> in south africa people have been infected up to 3 times in the past
[22:42:39] <ggreer> the only way I could see it being the case is if most people who got infected did so earlier in the pandemic
[22:42:39] <kuudes> and they still got infected by omicron
[22:43:05] <kuudes> even to the extent that the observed protective effect of earlier infections was actually negative
[22:43:13] <kuudes> which likely is because of selection effect
[22:43:20] <ggreer> if you got covid 3 times then you're almost certainly immunocompromised. like you have HIV (as 20% of south african adults do)

[22:51:10] <kuudes> one way how this could have happened is if there was a lab mouse infected with wuhan covid or south african variant, who was then tested against multiple antibody meds that are derived from the antibodies of people who have got infected in the past; but not antibodies from people who have got vaccinated
[22:51:37] <kuudes> so those antibodies omicron has learned to avoid are specifically the ones *people* make, not the ones vaccine makes
[22:51:48] <kuudes> and indeed this is peculiar
[22:52:00] <two2thehead> kuudes, huh
[22:52:03] <kuudes> your priors are correct, ggreer, the state of the world just is unexpected

[23:18:05] <gwern> there is a difference because there's always a difference. the question is merely what it is

[23:18:27] <two2thehead> Okay. To sum up as an ELI5, 'It's not *obviously* different one way or the other, but ideally we need more studies to prove it'?
[23:19:28] <gwern> still, I'm not going to complain because between the charbydis of 'everyone is committing suicide because of covid and global warming and structural racism' and the scylla of 'we failed to reject the null so we have proven there is exactly no change in suicide rates', I'll pay my monster tax and be quiet

[23:37:41] <kuudes> it is one of the best known facts about omicron

[23:41:00] <kuudes> if you are after vaccines, 2 dose of astrazeneca also provides about 0 effect against omicron
[23:41:15] <kuudes> also johnson vaccine is much weakened
[23:41:32] <kuudes> mrna vaccines fare some, and with third dose they become again reasonable, but still much weakened
[23:41:50] <kuudes> before omicron, three dose mrna was about nearly complete immunity from infection

[23:43:08] <pompolic> i think the repetition makes it memorable
[23:43:23] <pompolic> i also think, but i'm not sure, that this is just Bayes' rule 
[23:43:25] <kuudes> if we just boost our antibody counts exponentially more, we can remain above the virus evolution

[23:49:14] <gwern> (<0% protection? does that mean it makes you arrogant enough to go out and expose yourself so vaccinated groups are more likely to contract covid?)
[23:49:20] <kuudes> yes. hospitalizations are in table 6
[23:49:27] <kuudes> gwern, apparently
[23:49:32] <kuudes> same with previous infections
[23:49:49] <kuudes> ie people who have got those conditions get more infections than people without those conditions
[23:50:09] <kuudes> so people without vaccine hide more than people with 2 astrazenecas etc
[23:50:14] <ggreer> oh look even one dose of a vaccine reduces your chance of hospitalization by 52%
[23:50:24] <pompolic> my first thought when hearing that is that there are people with those conditions >>>>> people without those conditions
[23:50:28] <kuudes> yes. that is the t-cells
[23:50:31] <kuudes> as I said.
[23:50:33] <pompolic> base rate go brrr
[23:51:06] <ggreer> "pre-omicron infections do not give protection regarding omicron" <-- that's what you said
[23:51:16] <ggreer> and I said that makes no sense. and it turns out that I was correct
[23:51:27] <kuudes> "<kuudes> they give protection against hospitalization to some extent"
[23:52:09] <kuudes> <kuudes> pre-omicron infections do not give protection regarding omicron <kuudes> especially against getting infected or infecting others <kuudes> they give protection against hospitalization to some extent
[23:52:44] <ggreer> to an extent that is very important. nobody cares about infection if the infection is mild. people get colds all the time
[23:53:09] <kuudes> 50% effective vaccines won't get approved in eu or usa, they are considered too weak
[23:53:27] *** Quits: galambo (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:53:33] <kuudes> with booster the effect is 88% instead of 50%
[23:53:42] <two2thehead> "
[23:53:43] <two2thehead> During CES 2022, Razer introduced a new version of its N95 mask, the Zephyr Pro. The new mask brings back a microphone and speakers for voice amplificaiton. It starts at $150.
[23:53:43] <two2thehead> "
[23:53:48] <ggreer> obviously nobody is going to prescribe a previous version of covid to fight off omicron
[23:53:48] <kuudes> and with 2 dose it is the same as with 1 dose, 52% both
[23:54:00] <two2thehead> I'm sure a darth vader or bane voice mod will be easy to implement

[23:54:14] <kuudes> if hospitals will overcrowd by factor >>10 it does not matter if you halve that factor
[23:54:26] <two2thehead> "No one cared who I was till I put on the mask"
[23:54:32] <kuudes> and personally I would not trust my health for extra cointoss
[23:54:54] <kuudes> "oh it is not serious, if I otherwise would get into hospital, I have my magic coin which saves me on heads"
[23:55:03] <ggreer> that's very different from all the fearmongering about previous infections and no boosters offering no protection
[23:55:17] <kuudes> boosters offer protection, as I said.
[23:55:32] <gwern> two2thehead: for >$150 it'd better have some powered pump to make it easier to breath -_-
[23:55:34] <kuudes> you are reading to my mouth something you project but I have not said.
[23:55:38] <kuudes> please stop doing that
[23:55:57] <two2thehead> kek
[23:56:03] <two2thehead> that's... true :V
[23:56:46] <ggreer> my point is that people *already* got infected with previous versions, and most people have already gotten two shots. that mild protection combined with the fact that omicron is milder means that we'll have shitloads of infections but not nearly as many hospitalizations
[23:57:15] <ggreer> it won't be like april 2020 in new york, or last winter in a lot of places
[23:58:06] <kuudes> omicron appears to be about as harsh as original strain
[23:58:15] <kuudes> it is half of delta, which was about double of anything before
[23:58:32] <kuudes> so it is about in line of the south african variant which is its closest ancestor
[23:58:56] <gwern> two2thehead: I mean, without some powering, all it is is a $10 n95 mask with a $5 microphone sandwiched to the back of a speaker
[23:59:03] <gwern> oh and it's black and 'cool'
[23:59:18] <kuudes> but yes, there is hope that especially with vaccinations+previous infections there will be less effects
[23:59:25] <two2thehead> nooo, noo. It's a gamer mask! :-))))
