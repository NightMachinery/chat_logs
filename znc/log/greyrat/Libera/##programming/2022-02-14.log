[01:28:13] <beaky> yes to collapse the tree you must use the fixed point operator
[01:28:28] <ProfSimm> I have a riddle: what is this, that when it has one thing, is just that one thing itself, but when it's two or more things, it's something else?
[01:28:59] <pyzozord> what's a fixed point operator
[01:29:21] <pyzozord> some kinda combinator
[01:29:23] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: I assume broken point operator, after someone fixes it
[01:29:54] <sonny> Does visual studio require an account if you have a product key?
[01:30:12] <pyzozord> oh it's Y combinator
[01:30:30] <pyzozord> I kinda forgot what Y combinator does. It makes recursion possible in untyped lambda
[01:30:38] <ProfSimm> beaky: so you suggest the tree doens't collapse, but the collapse is the projection through a special operator
[01:30:48] <beaky> yes the fixed point operator evaluates its argument to its 'fixed point' which is the most normalized form that it gets stuck to (there's also type-level fixed point operator for functors like in haskell and some other alternatives i forget the name of)
[01:31:22] <beaky> yes the special operator that will completely flatten the tree (the list as fixed point)
[01:31:57] <ProfSimm> I'm kinda trying to keep my pie and eat it too, i.e. not need an operator in order to read the tree both ways
[01:32:39] <pyzozord> so in other words "just walk the tree"
[01:32:40] <beaky> yes there's an alterantive to fixed point that i forget i read baout it in a paper by the son of simon peyton jones one of the creators of haskell
[01:32:46] <ProfSimm> Not quite pyzozord
[01:34:01] <ProfSimm> I'm kinda imagining a tuple/sequence that is opaque and you need to call "next" on it to pop values, and then when there's one value left, it becomes the value itself, the sequence disappears
[01:34:09] <ProfSimm> Basically it substitutes itself with its last element
[01:34:54] <ProfSimm> Something like that I guess
[01:35:23] <pyzozord> Y just applies the function to itself I think. In lambda world that means transforming the symbols, in real world it means just recurisve call. Recursion is the basic way of doing dfs/bfs on trees

[01:37:07] <ProfSimm> Actually this is a bit like generators.

[02:00:54] <nomagno> You make a wrapper for netcat/curl/whatever, and the IRC server just operates on a subfolder
[02:01:12] <bnchs> so i found a good 2D math library written in pure C (although no CPU optimizations)
[02:01:30] <pyzozord> oh yeah I am thinking about trying to use irc via netcat too
[02:01:31] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: on the other hand, it stops on every call, so it's stoppable in specific, just not stoppable if you keep calling it :)
[02:01:38] <pyzozord> recently implemented a http server in netcat and it was fun

[02:01:58] <pyzozord> very very slow comparing to nginx, but hey, way simpler too
[02:02:05] <nomagno> pyzozord: Well it's pretty easy overall yeah, and netcat isn't even that advanced a tool! It's just a CLI wrapper for TCP

[02:05:26] <pyzozord> only thing you can do to check if you are done is value(value) == (value, value) then you know ok we evaluated this onece, we got the same output, now we are really at the fixed point
[02:05:34] <nomagno> I believe this directory structure for the server would be more than enough
[02:06:04] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: the problem is we can have (1, 1, 1, 2) and if we don't check the seq is a seq, we might incorrectly conclude it's over or?
[02:06:07] <pyzozord> I was thinking really simpler than that, just connect to an irc server with netcat, and type out the commands manually

[02:08:22] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: I think that's why they brought monads to haskell
[02:08:38] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: I heard story that they had problems with that for quite a while

[02:08:54] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: right
[02:09:01] <ProfSimm> Maybe they knew about monads ;-)
[02:09:15] <pyzozord> no no they didn't, they got a new guy and he knew
[02:09:36] <pyzozord> but that was 70s or 80s

[04:27:02] <sonny> nomagno: sure it does, the organization can be represented in many ways
[04:27:12] <koollman> nomagno: trees are too restrictive. graphs may be nice (which is possibly with symlinks, at least). tagging is nicer, in general :)
[04:27:36] <arahael> perro_: It's even worse when you have sandboxed applications.
[04:27:36] <nomagno> sonny: ... Did you know a list of directories is a tree?
[04:27:50] <Zogatribe> abstractions *on top of* file systems are fine
[04:27:55] <sonny> did I mention directories?
[04:28:01] <ProfSimm> arahael: that's something I think about a lot. Is tree the best organizational structure. With symlinks it's technically a graph. It's like programming. Syntax is a tree, but with vars and runtime behavior, it's a graph
[04:28:13] <ProfSimm> arahael: I think a file system should've been relational
[04:28:28] <nomagno> sonny: You'd end up prefixing the files with FOO_file, FOO_SUBBAR_file, etc...
[04:28:38] <sonny> ProfSimm: apparently m$ tried that
[04:28:47] <nomagno> It WOULD happen. I don't have many doubts
[04:28:50] <ProfSimm> sonny: they did but they went too ambitious with it.
[04:28:56] <ProfSimm> sonny: gotta KISS
[04:29:00] <sonny> yeah
[04:29:09] <arahael> ProfSimm: They probably should be, maybe.  I think filesystems should've been left *entirely* to the user. "Here's the space you can put your crap".  And each application instead has a relational database they can use for their own data.
[04:29:12] <nomagno> I mean, symlinks work well enough in my experience
[04:29:13] <sonny> that's the hardest part I think
[04:29:23] <nomagno> They're ALSO a clean way of enhancing functionality of a filesysten
[04:29:25] <nomagno> As are hardlinks
[04:29:30] <arahael> ProfSimm: You _almost_ have that, but as an additional layer on top of the filesystem, in mobile apps these days anyway, using sqlite.
[04:29:38] <sonny> arahael: yeah I prefer that already
[04:29:43] <ProfSimm> arahael: yeah

[04:30:06] <arahael> ProfSimm: In PalmOS, there was no filesystem, it was just a key-value database.
[04:30:06] <ProfSimm> arahael: well mobile apps seggegate storage, which is nice and secure but we still need a story for sharing
[04:30:10] <Decker> that's what FUSE is too

[04:30:49] <ProfSimm> arahael: for example iPhone refused to have a file browser for like 7-8 versions of the OS. Jobs famously hated the idea. But eventually, boom, iCloud Drive and boom Files app
[04:31:02] <arahael> ProfSimm: Might as well just provide an empty sqlite object and say: "Put the crap you want to share into that", at the application data level.
[04:31:08] <nomagno> Decker: android essentially did the laziest possible sandboxing
[04:31:10] <Decker> it's a inteface you can implement code for - it'll probably ask for things like /some/path/file

[04:31:28] <ProfSimm> arahael: maybe there's a way to faciliate data exchange over relational format. Maybe shared relations
[04:31:44] <arahael> ProfSimm: (And they don't actually represent the file system - they're interacting with an exposed API for the specified application)

[04:32:16] <arahael> ProfSimm: Yes, the API for that is remarkably complex. :(
[04:32:18] <ProfSimm> arahael: copy it out is good yes
[04:32:23] <sonny> paper is simple to represent graphically, but of course, it's made of multiple files

[04:35:50] <sonny> the trickiest part of all, is how to name objects
[04:35:59] <ProfSimm> arahael: reference counts are not bad on their own. They're used to implement value semantics in Swift for ex.
[04:36:00] <sonny> or rather, how to label them
[04:36:02] <arahael> I don't know if reference counts can be criticised in that ecosystem, they're glorious.
[04:36:20] <ProfSimm> arahael: what I mean is references as in "modify at distance".

[04:42:29] <absentia> `npm install operating_system`
[04:42:44] <ProfSimm> sonny: well let me elaborate 1) you can copy something /value semantics/ 2) you can move something /linear logic/ 3) you can reference, but only if the thing is immutable (in which case it's semantically equivalent to 1) copy, but more efficient)
[04:43:09] <sonny> move, like rust and c++?
[04:43:14] <ProfSimm> Yes
[04:43:17] <sonny> ok
[04:43:23] <ProfSimm> Or like moving and copying files :)
[04:44:07] *** suss` is now known as suss
[04:44:38] <ProfSimm> I think it's a much more natural paradigm. It's like real life. If something is easy to copy you can pass a copy. If not, you need to pass the original, move it. And immutable artifacts, that again is just an optimization
[04:44:45] <sonny> objects do make sense for non programmers, I'll admit that much
[04:44:52] <sonny> especially for graphical systems
[04:45:30] <ProfSimm> Reference in real life is not like 10 people magically have the same object. Reference in real life is more like having the primary key to an entity in a DB.
[04:45:33] <sonny> ProfSimm: sounds like an implementation detail, not paradigm
[04:45:43] <ProfSimm> You have the reference but you need to ASK the database for the entity, which is THERE
[04:46:14] <ProfSimm> sonny: it changes how you program though. As evident in rust. In C++ it's more an implementation detail, because you're not forced into it
[04:46:41] <ProfSimm> If you don't force anything and allow everything, sure, you don't change the paradigm
[04:46:52] <sonny> rust changes how you program because it uses a different paradigm

[05:10:54] <ProfSimm> Decker: it's very simple, to reason about a program, or anything at all, our brain needs to connect cause and effect.

[05:12:08] <Decker> I want to consult multiple other peers for their data, which they may all have, 1 might have, or none might have

[05:13:10] <Decker> i supposed beyond that point... you're asking about finding some exception that occured

[05:13:28] <ProfSimm> Decker: you're talking about distributed queries, but that doesn't imply shared mutable state.
[05:13:40] <Decker> and if the expected result is disconnected and never is heard then you get a timeout condition
[05:13:41] <ProfSimm> It's full of wonderful algorithms like CRDT and CQRS and so on
[05:13:54] <ProfSimm> For managing distributed state. Distributed state doesn't mean shared mutable state
[05:14:08] <absentia> what's the difference
[05:14:16] <sonny> sharing state across threads is a separate problem
[05:14:22] <ProfSimm> absentia: the difference is coordination
[05:14:35] <absentia> for which
[05:14:48] <Decker> okay - but dekware has a shared mutable state between objects - but only when that list of states changes is there really a required lock - they can all operate togther on all of the lists... but because every list is now a 'smart list' theres an overhead of an aautomatic lock/unlock
[05:15:10] <Decker> which - when you end up with a single threaded JS application - that lock could hurt
[05:15:20] <ProfSimm> absentia: it's one thing to command an object to mutate, another thing to ask a system to carry out a set of mutations indirectly through messages, and then the system can linearize these commands so they're causally consistent, i.e. coordination.

[07:51:02] <ejjfunky> hi all. if you guys had to choose a programming language to start a new personal project, will you choose: 1. Python. 2. C#?
[07:51:45] <Crocodillian> depends on what you like and your programming skills/knowledge, for people getting started with programming python is an excellent choice
[07:52:11] <Crocodillian> definitely not C#
[07:52:13] <ejjfunky> say that both are equal.
[07:52:23] <ejjfunky> for the like and skills/knowledge.

[07:52:47] <Crocodillian> no that doesn't tell me anything, there are many languages for many different purposes
[07:52:48] <ejjfunky> Crocodillian, why not C#?

[08:03:23] <jeaye> vrp2zqL7: The point of the additional features in C++ are to make these things easier. Depending on how well you utilize them, working in C++ can be much saner than working in C.
[08:04:11] <Crocodillian> language features are just details
[08:04:28] <Crocodillian> you can do anything in any language but you use the language that makes the thing you want to do easiest
[08:04:46] <jeaye> vrp2zqL7: Also, since C++ is largely a superset of C, anything you'd want to do in C you can also do in C++. You'll just have a stronger type system on top, and namespaces, and better casting, and uniform initialization, and generics, and type deduction, and closures, and so on.

[08:32:15] <InPhase> ejjfunky: C# is a suboptimal language to invest a lot of time in, because it is still not a properly cross-platform language, and likely never will be.
[08:32:41] <KillerWasp> Decker: i guess that you also build the virtual terminal :P
[08:33:36] <InPhase> ejjfunky: Python is a fine language to work on, as long as you're not talking about a large project.  Python's strengths are in rapid development with some clean compact language to do a lot in a little space with strong library support.  But it does not have the level of constraints necessary to scale to larger applications and retain good maintainability.

[08:34:56] <ejjfunky> InPhase, ic. thanks for the input.
[08:35:01] <vrp2zqL7> Here is a link to an article about why C, C++, and Java are problematic: https://sites.radford.edu/~ibarland/Manifestoes/whyC++isBad.shtml
[08:35:08] <InPhase> ejjfunky: So then there are quite a lot of other languages to choose from, but it really depends on what kind of programming project you're looking to start.  And if it's for learning purposes, what sorts of programming projects you want to get better equipped for in the future.
[08:35:46] <KillerWasp> vrp2zqL7: I already think directly how inexperienced your publisher is.

[08:37:55] <KillerWasp> Any language can be problematic if programming is not your thing. You are only looking for problems in one language or in another language. What you really need is a tool that works, and not one that makes you feel safe.

[13:09:50] <vdamewood> Well, Persian doesn't derive from Sanskrit, They derive from a common ancestor.
[13:10:01] <mrig> if I were to look for its roots, the verbal aural practice seems to have really preserved them better.
[13:10:30] <mrig> none really know, history having the vagaries that it does.
[13:10:49] <pikapika> mrig, from what I can find with a quick search, there are two branches: old persian and avestan. Modern persian came from the former and sanskrit from the latter.
[13:10:54] <pikapika> So no they aren't directly related
[13:11:03] <pikapika> and basically came from parallel branches
[13:11:26] <pikapika> vdamewood, yeah
[13:11:30] <pikapika> Common ancestor seems most likely

[13:16:42] <pikapika> As I already speculated in the beginning
[13:16:49] <pikapika> Most probably its parallel branches from a common ancestor
[13:16:56] <mrig> The thing that bothers me is the 500 year or so advance in psychology that I find in the roots of sanskrit that I've not found anywhere else, the notion of linear time that we are currently using to discuss where it came from makes very little sense to me in this context.
[13:17:29] <mrig> vdamewood sure, but I put more importance on the verbal tradition, because it is phonetic and due to the way that the grammar works.
[13:17:48] <mrig> so written material proof is really pretty misleading here.

[16:35:56] <Rounin> ProfSimm: How do you go from everything being determined to everything being an illusion and not making a lick of sense?
[16:36:15] <Rounin> You could say the same about non-determinism.... "Oh, there's a theory that everything is random and nothing makes a lick of sense"
[16:37:03] <ProfSimm> Rounin: simple. The idea is the cause is external to the universe, we just observe effects, therefore all our conclusions about cause...effect based on our observations are false. Sort of like Super Mario thinks he's hitting stone pixels and that keeps him on the ground, but actually he's full of it
[16:37:09] <mrig> The illusion is the part in your mind that you thought was reality, does not mean that reality does not exist, only that your perception on it is illusory.
[16:38:07] <Rounin> ProfSimm: You can always question whether the laws of physics and causality will always hold... After all, where does the universe come from, etc., but what does that have to do with determinism?
[16:38:28] <ProfSimm> Rounin: in other words, when you step on a weight scale, it's not your weight pressing the scale down. It's some state back at the Big Bang which superdetermined you step on the scale and the scale shows some weight, actually you stepping on it didn't cause the result.
[16:38:41] <mrig> ProfSimm what happened to the temporal frame of reference in your big bang model? Makes no sense to me.

[16:40:15] <ProfSimm> mrig: time is a complex topic. From my reading, aside from time being local to literally our every particle, what we experience as time is highly derivative of more foundational versions of time.
[16:40:23] <mrig> big bang is a fairy story in my opinion.
[16:40:30] <ProfSimm> mrig: anyway hard to wrap it in a sentence
[16:40:40] <mrig> I think that there are better ones than this if you must tell them.
[16:40:44] <Rounin> ProfSimm: Still, I don't find the idea that strange... Obviously thingsl ike the laws of physics etc. could have some underlying layer that we've yet to dig down into or understand
[16:40:56] <ProfSimm> mrig: big bang is just a projection based on current measurements. It's likely part right part wrong, like everything

[16:43:48] <Rounin> ProfSimm: Also, does it really say that we "don't cause" the effects, or that what we refer to as "causing" is simply a static pattern that holds over a very large area of spacetime

[16:44:23] <ProfSimm> Rounin: if you want research superdeterminism on your own and you'll come to similar conclusions. Yes I'm using colorful words to describe it, but that's the essence of it
[16:44:40] <mrig> There is a superb demonstration of entanglement and perhaps it is the origin of proof of it that I read, as an extension of the quantum slit experiment; I must look that up again.
[16:44:56] <ProfSimm> Rounin: no what you describe is simply "determinism". And superdeterminism breaks the cause..effect relationship
[16:44:56] <Rounin> The essence of your opinion of it... You could describe the theory of atoms the same way... "What, are you saying we don't exist and are only made up of particles? Haha"
[16:45:38] <ProfSimm> Rounin: the "super" in superdeterminism is about nothing happening right now being a cause to anything. It just looks like that way
[16:45:47] <mrig> anyone familiar with that? Using icelandic spar I think to examine the state of a photon after its double has hit a detector, or some such, but I forget the details.
[16:45:55] <Rounin> ProfSimm: So if it looks that way and continues to look that way, how is it broken?
[16:46:30] <Rounin> Did we have a better idea about how causality happened before that wasn't broken?
[16:47:22] <ProfSimm> Rounin: I suggest you read about it and make your own conclusions. You'll keep thinking I'm being silly, because the theory is silly itself.
[16:47:42] <Rounin> I suppose I'd better do that, ProfSimm... It helps to know the basics of the subject, after all
[16:47:46] <mrig> ProfSimm does this stem from holographic theory?
[16:48:04] <ProfSimm> mrig: it's related as a concept, but it's even more dramatic.
[16:48:29] <mrig> I like it, have no cause not to accept this over big bang and linear time. Both are reasonably plausible facets of reality.
[16:48:47] <mrig> big band, to me, looks like the bigger fairy story.
[16:49:04] <ProfSimm> mrig: in holographic theory the 3D world is just a projection of something encoded on a 2D surface of a surrounding sphere, and therefore the mechanics need to happen on that 2D surface. But in superdeterminism the reason is not simply away from us in space, but away from us in time too
[16:49:09] <mrig> but then my studies, that I base this conclusion on, are pretty abstract.

And in practice we added less noise to 
[17:08:38] <InPhase> the simulations than reality had, because we wanted to simulate cleaner signals for method-testing purposes.  But I also know how to add noise to a simulation.  With enough competence behind results, it all falls apart without trust.

[18:01:02] <ProfSimm> mrig: oh you mean because nerves are affected, not only olfactory cells
[18:01:22] <InPhase> mrig: I think it is a gross misestimation of the robustness of evolution to assume intelligent life requires an environment exactly like our own.  Life as a whole on this planet is astonishingly robust to differing conditions on Earth, and patterns of increasing intelligence appear across a wide swath of these conditions.  We happen to be the pinacle species of intelligence on this particular planet 
[18:01:23] <mrig> and the thyroid is related to the entire system, particularly the spleen.
[18:01:28] <InPhase> simply because one always has to be first in each species pile.  But there's good indication that our line didn't exist, intelligence would arise elsewhere in another species line within a few hundred million years, which is essentially no time at all in a universal timescale.
[18:02:23] <epony> so, it's NOT spongiform
[18:02:30] <epony> as in "not a prion" disease
[18:02:36] <epony> which is the important part you need to remember
[18:02:51] <InPhase> mrig: So I think it is more likely that life across the universe is far more diverse than life here, and that intelligence has arisen in a very wide variety of conditions.  The most important conclusion of this is that we are probably not edible for most of the intelligent life out there.  :)
[18:02:57] <mrig> InPhase, well Im thinking of the harmonic spectrum and its importance, as seen in the way that it pops up all over, this does not diminish the probabilities with the infinities involved, but it does alter the way that we think about our environment.
[18:03:37] <epony> so the "C"reutzfeldt-Jacob disease hypothesis is rejected, if you would know the real name of the disease without even consulting "what does that two names of people mean really"
[18:03:58] <mrig> so that would just mean that that the prerequisites are more concisely defined, I don't think that changes the overall conclusion though. It would alter where we look though.
[18:04:43] <mrig> InPhase I think that the way that it consider time is perhaps that which take my mind away from putting to much importance upon evolution.

[18:05:36] <mrig> sure it is a thing, but it interacts with time in a more complicated way than is often depicted, perhaps a better way of putting it.
[18:06:21] <InPhase> mrig: I think the whole thing rests on the robustness of evolution as a process.  It is self-optimizing to whatever conditions and changing conditions are put in front of it.

[19:44:41] <ProfSimm> _73: to me everything that's redundant, is a downside. KISS.
[19:45:01] <GeDaMo> What's a 'generalized boolean'?
[19:47:08] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: apparently not what I thought.
[19:47:09] <_73> GeDaMo: Say in Perl 0, the empty string, and empty array are considered False while every other value is considered True. This is opposed to having dedicated True and False constants. 
[19:47:27] <GeDaMo> Ah
[19:47:37] <ProfSimm> _73: we normally refer to these as falsy and truthy values
[19:47:56] <_73> I would have said in C 0 is false and everything else is true, but I don't remember if that is totally true :)
[19:47:58] <ProfSimm> _73: would you say generalized bools is the LACK of dedicated bool values
[19:48:08] <InPhase> ProfSimm: I've been slowly working on my own language for over a decade, perpetually in the redesign stage, but I can share what I think is most important for future languages.  The key challenges we require going forward are having languages that simultaneously have strong constraints for scalability, flexible metaprogramming ability for better abstraction and adaptation, and natural support for 
[19:48:14] <InPhase> truly massive parallelism built into the language.  We don't need languages that can synchronize between 4-8 threads.  We need languages that can compile down to operations across thousands to millions of threads.
[19:48:14] <pyzozord> "truthy" and "falsey" in js-speach
[19:48:26] <bjs> ProfSimm: Python has both a dedicated boolean type and also a notion of truthiness/falsiness
[19:48:35] <ProfSimm> bjs: indeed, many do
[19:48:50] <ProfSimm> I'm in the LISP camp. Null is falsey, everything else is truthy, no dedicated values
[19:49:14] <bjs> _73: the advantage is that types have some inbuilt notion of what it means to be true/false so you can write code generic over a lot of different structures. The downside is that every type has a fixed inbuilt notion of what it means to be true...
[19:49:15] <_73> One downside is in readability you have to remember what is true and false but that is only a problem for the non-experienced users.

[19:50:06] <pulse> what a dumb platform
[19:50:06] <ProfSimm> _73: I think it's a downside to have multiple falsey values because confusion is inevitable. You think something is empty array, it's 0, or you think it's 0, but it's null, or it's false.
[19:50:16] <InPhase> ProfSimm: Undefined behavior needs to go.  We need languages where we can construct a structure and have very high confidence that it is doing exactly what we think it's doing when scaled up to millions of lines sprawled out across thousands to millions of concurrent operations.
[19:50:22] <ProfSimm> _73: if only null is falsey and everything else isn't, newbies shouldn;t be confused
[19:51:03] <vysn> isn't Rust supposed to solve a lot these problems in programming
[19:51:07] <_73> ProfSimm: I agree

[19:51:40] <pulse> it's a take on UB that i rarely see in the wild
[19:51:54] <InPhase> vysn: Rust is a natural strong evolution in language design fit for the future.  But I'm talking about languages that go beyond the generation of problems Rust is trying to solve.
[19:52:00] <_73> Haskell solves this nicely with Eq typeclass
[19:52:17] <zzz> yes it does
[19:52:22] <bjs> _73: well Haskell's Eq typeclass isn't quite what you describe
[19:52:43] <[itchyjunk]> nice haskell
[19:52:46] <ProfSimm> InPhase: ok we have the same goals. Why not exchange ideas on how to get there :)
[19:52:48] <pyzozord> pulse: tldr?
[19:52:56] <bjs> _73: what you describe is more like having a Truthy typeclass like `class Truthy b => toBool :: b -> Bool` which is closer to what languages like Python have
[19:53:25] <pulse> pyzozord, "avoiding UB is double negation, maybe we should look into ensuring well-defined behavior instead"
[19:53:40] <pyzozord> thx

[19:56:50] <pulse> most safety concerns stem from logical errors, and there's not a thing a compiler can do about those
[19:57:03] <InPhase> pulse: UB is terrible.  The one case that article highlights as good is actually just a very bad syntax for making a programmer promise to the optimizer about a mathematical guarantee.  I'm okay with languages supporting giving a promise to the optimizer if the optimizer is not smart enough to figure out certain things that are 100% guaranteed.

[19:57:38] <ProfSimm> pulse: pyzozord: https://security.web.cern.ch/recommendations/en/codetools/c.shtml Professionals say it's buffer overflows and pointers
[19:57:44] <_73> Can dependent types `somewhat` help solve logical errors?
[19:57:52] <bjs> _73: yes.
[19:58:02] <pulse> i'm fully aware my opinion isn't mainstream, so i encourage most people to discard it asap ;)
[19:58:14] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: yes, that's my impression as well
[19:58:23] <InPhase> pulse: Ultimately most of that effort should go into making smarter optimizers though, as it is safer to automate this sort of reasoning.  And in fact, that effort continues to happen.  Most of the justifications that have been given in the past for UB have been washed away by optimizer improvements after those situations came to light as optimizer defects.
[19:58:25] <_73> bjs: I need to try a language with dependent types. Seems cool.

[19:58:49] <pulse> InPhase, i understand the reasoning, but i disagree it would actually make code safer. perhaps marginally
[19:58:53] <bjs> People shouldn't discard it, they should understand why it's not mainstream and why so many of the big CWEs are just variations on buffer overflows.

[19:59:41] <ProfSimm> pulse: Rust was born after decades of experience in writing a browser in C and fixing its vulnerabilities. You need to give them a bit of credit for having a clue what they need
[19:59:42] <pulse> but again that's my take. i know it's not a popular one
[20:00:07] <InPhase> pulse: Nearly every really serious security hole is from UB.  It's a really big problem that is underemphasized because people overestimate their ability to consistently catch these problems.
[20:00:38] <_73> pulse: you are saying that we should focus more on improving programmer skill instead of making tools that make it easier to now screw up?
[20:00:52] <zzz> pulse: would you consider haskell an instance of a better tool for dumber programmers?
[20:00:58] <InPhase> pulse: I happen to think I'm pretty smart and really good at writing safe code.  I also have been doing it long enough to know how often I've missed things, and how often UB has leaked into my code from third party libraries or their interfaces.  It's a major epidemic in the field.
[20:01:30] <pulse> i don't believe that InPhase. most security holes come as epiphenomena from software complexity
[20:01:41] <pulse> the checklist of what you have to do to write C code safely isn't all that long

[20:02:24] <ProfSimm> pulse: the list isn't long
[20:02:29] <bjs> pulse: the issue is that the language design turns small logical errors in the program into large exploitable surfaces
[20:03:00] <bjs> I think it's a good idea to both teach people about the languages they use so they understand this but also develop newer better tools that reduce the damage small mistakes can induce
[20:03:06] <pulse> ProfSimm, false equivalency. better would be making a car. it's hard to make a car and make it safe too. and having better robots sure helps but what helps far more is having an engineering team that delivers a safe design
[20:03:12] <_73> In my opinion humans naturally suck at programming so we need the tools to help. 
[20:03:29] <zzz> pyzozord: it does make you smarter in ct however, and ct is useful when applied to programming
[20:03:34] <InPhase> pulse: I just lost 2 weeks of work to what was ultimately UB triggered by a C interface I had to deal with in a program that is otherwise structured to not have UB anywhere.  The UB was so duplicitously hiding that I spent most of those 2 weeks thinking I was dealing with a hardware issue, when really it leaked in very subtly and slowly during a series of like 6 refactors which in combination 
[20:03:37] <ProfSimm> pulse: false equivalency, robot don't design cars
[20:03:40] <InPhase> created UB in that C interface component.
[20:03:51] <ProfSimm> pulse: languages do shape and force design on code
[20:03:52] <pulse> InPhase, yeah that does happen and it sucks
[20:04:42] <pyzozord> zzz: nah, it's like saying "knowing about thermodynamics makes you a better driver"
[20:04:58] <ProfSimm> pulse: C is in effect a giant region of shared global mutable space, where you have indexes (pointers) and the hope is you never make mistakes what index is what, who you allow where to go from an index and so on.
[20:05:06] <pyzozord> sorry not thermodynamics, the other one, aerodynamics :P
[20:05:11] <InPhase> pulse: I consider it fortunate that it actually manifested strongly enough to notice.  This is a program that's supposed to stimulate human brains.  Of course the interface I struggled with had to do with the C interface for the hardware that is involved with this, so there was no way around the fragility.
[20:05:17] <ProfSimm> pulse: that's disastrous design, that is only excused by the times C was invented in
[20:05:28] <pyzozord> but thermodeynamics works just as well for that example tbh
[20:05:31] <pulse> ProfSimm, it comes down to, would you rather have a ninja-tier C coder or an average rust coder build your security-sensitive application?

[20:06:27] <pulse> obviously a ninja-tier rust coder might be the best of two worlds, but if i had to pick between those two, i'd pick ninja tier C coder
[20:06:40] <pyzozord> pulse: I'd rather go with the ninja and whatever tools they want
[20:06:41] <mrig> seems that you get similar sorts of logical errors from concurrent code too, by way of all the possible race conditions.
[20:06:45] <pulse> and therein lies the problem as far as i'm concerned. programmer skill is worth far more than tooling
[20:06:50] <zzz> pyzozord: not sure if i understand your analogy. i think it's more like saying that driving makes you a better mechanic
[20:06:51] <pulse> pyzozord++
[20:06:54] <ProfSimm> pulse: C coders aren't better because they use C.
[20:07:04] <pulse> ProfSimm, and rust coders aren't better because they use rust
[20:07:04] <ProfSimm> pulse: in fact most C coders are quite average
[20:07:05] <mrig> logical incoherence that is not spotted but is not an error.
[20:07:15] <InPhase> pulse: But ultimately, we should have languages and interfaces for which this sort of problem is simply impossible.  It's extremely important to be able to know things are correct and do what they look like they will do.  I have enough safeguard layers put in that I don't think anyone was at risk from this issue (plus we do a lot of testing, recognizing the problems that can arise), but lives are 
[20:07:15] <pulse> imagine the average rust coders then
[20:07:19] <ProfSimm> pulse: they are better because they use rust actually. 
[20:07:21] <InPhase> often on the line with code, and UB makes it very very hard to guarantee correctness.
[20:07:24] <pyzozord> zzz: ct is too removed from programming, too abstract, it is not useful for programming
[20:07:40] <pulse> InPhase, sure, better tools aren't a bad idea
[20:08:06] <pulse> i don't mind rust and the likes. i just find the idea that languages will fix our safety concern a bit overly enthusiastic
[20:08:15] <pyzozord> zzz: any advanced math theory is mostly useless for programming. Algorithm design or architecture maybe, but also eh maybe not so much
[20:08:21] <pulse> most problems are logical, tools don't help there. what's between the ears does
[20:08:23] <zzz> pyzozord: do you think algebra is too removed from provtamming?
[20:08:25] <InPhase> pulse: My core take-home message is that faced with any optimization challenge, there is pretty much ALWAYS another way to get optimal behavior rather than introducing UB.  And people should spend their efforts looking for those.
[20:08:25] <mrig> calculative errors are superb too, not an error, just the wrong answer, and no means to test it.
[20:08:55] <ProfSimm> pulse: human focus is limited. It doesn't matter if you're "average" or "ninja". The better design of the language, the more your attention focuses to the important things. 
[20:08:58] <pyzozord> zzz: unless you are designing specific algebraic algorithms yes, I did 10 years without it and no problems
[20:09:00] <zzz> pyzozord: graph theory?
[20:09:04] <pulse> ProfSimm, disagreed
[20:09:11] <pulse> the vast majority of programmers are subpar
[20:09:11] <pyzozord> zzz: again, algorithms, not programming
[20:09:12] <ProfSimm> pulse: ok.
[20:09:15] <pulse> we should be training them better. shaolin style
[20:09:32] <ProfSimm> pulse: so your solution is wishful thinking
[20:09:45] <pulse> why wishful, i've met extremely good programmers
[20:09:47] <mrig> the astronomy community have been leaning on some of those for ages :D
[20:09:50] <InPhase> pulse: The majority of programmers have only a handful of years of experience or less.  :)
[20:09:53] <pulse> to say their attention span is limited is insulting to their skill, lol
[20:09:56] <ProfSimm> pulse: even good programmers can make a typo
[20:10:03] <pulse> it's not about typos
[20:10:10] <ProfSimm> pulse: the odds this typo will open an exploit in C is giant compared to rust
[20:10:20] <pulse> that's such a silly argument to me
[20:10:20] <InPhase> It is a perpetually young field, and will stay that way until it reaches a level saturation point someday.
[20:10:39] <ProfSimm> pulse: it's silly but it's a fact, you need to study real world exploits
[20:10:39] <pulse> just because your average grandma can't beat a rally record, doesn't mean everyone has to drive a city Kia
[20:10:47] <pyzozord> zzz: but category theory is far removed, graph theory, type theory, those currently have tangible applications in cs. Category theory does not. It's not useful for engineers. When scientits come up with useful applications, then it might be useful
[20:10:52] <pulse> rally drivers should beat those records, not grandma drivers
[20:11:06] <ProfSimm> pulse: just because you can drive a car doesn't mean you don't need air cushion and seatbelt
[20:11:10] <bjs> pulse: very few programmers are "rally drivers" of programming
[20:11:10] <pulse> and safety-sensitive applications should be written by programmers of highest skill tier
[20:11:20] <pulse> and the language is marginally important at best
[20:11:22] <zzz> pyzozord: graph theory and algebra are both useful for managing complexity, optimization and problem solving. i guess it depends on what kind of programming you do, but i never found mathematics useless, not in the least
[20:11:26] <bjs> and rally drivers focus a lot on safety of their vehicles
[20:11:28] <pulse> bjs, which is precisely why we have so many issues
[20:11:42] <ProfSimm> bjs: that's apparently, because they're mediocre drivers
[20:11:52] <zzz> pyzozord: category theory has applications
[20:12:04] <bjs> pulse: your approach would try train everyone to be rally drivers in '80s cars for their trip to the shops
[20:12:06] <bjs> it's insanity :P

[20:12:54] <bjs> pulse: rust and c aren't people, they are tools. A programmer that can use Rust can use C and vice-versa
[20:12:55] <pyzozord> zzz: everythin you learn is useful and has applications if you try hard enough

[20:14:11] <InPhase> I think there are hard limits to what I can achieve in programming without strong language constraints and guarantees.  I need to be able to express these guarantees in order to scale code up reliably, because even if I know how to program very reliable pieces, there is ultimately a limit to what a human can focus on and hold in mind at one time.  The computer needs to be managing some part of this

[20:16:19] <pyzozord> zzz: for computer scientists, math is fundamental, computer science is a branch of mathematics, that's a different story though

[20:17:10] <pulse> idk, it may be
[20:17:13] <bjs> "C" is not performant, the decades of work on gcc and clang are what are performant
[20:17:21] <ProfSimm> pulse: Rust has zero cost abstractions C can never implement 
[20:17:23] <pulse> ProfSimm, rust isn't simple though
[20:17:39] <ProfSimm> pulse: oh so your ninja Einstein programmers find Rust too hard, what a bummer
[20:17:44] <ProfSimm> pulse: they need a simple language
[20:17:46] <bjs> pulse: I mean C isn't simple either really, no modern "high-level language" is simple.
[20:17:50] <pulse> no, now you completely misunderstand what i'm saying
[20:18:05] <pulse> there's charm to simplicity which also gets you optimal performance
[20:18:08] <pulse> it's the right balance of yin and yang

[20:18:24] <pulse> maybe we can talk later when you do ;)
[20:18:41] <apotheon> There are many difficulties in software development, and a programming language should primarily reduce some, and secondarily reduce others.

[20:18:57] <apotheon> Some people are better at handling some, and worse at others.  This varies from person to person.
[20:19:09] <ProfSimm> pulse: well I think simply we need to speak like engineers. Referring to emotions is not a good engineering approach imho
[20:19:12] <apotheon> Pick a language whose complexity management focus fits your needs.
[20:19:22] <pulse> ProfSimm, average engineers. ask carmack about that
[20:19:37] <apotheon> . . . not one that fits ProfSimm's needs, if you aren't ProfSimm.

[20:20:14] <zzz> pyzozord: hard disagree. "math" is what allows you to build programs that have some kind of guarantees and functional structure (modularity for instance), otherwise you're building bad software. (if we're allowing for it, then i can't say you're wrong. there certainly is no shortage of it)
[20:20:33] <pulse> ProfSimm, doesn't really matter to me. i'm not saying delete rust from existence. rust is good
[20:20:43] <pulse> you're the one saying "delete C from existence because i hate it"
[20:20:56] <pulse> i for one love C
[20:21:14] <ProfSimm> pulse: there's precisely one reason why C is popular and that is ecosystem. As both source and binary compat. 
[20:21:17] <pyzozord> zzz: I disagree with "you will write bad programs if you don't know math", that doesn't make any sense to me
[20:21:36] <pulse> ProfSimm, and it's legacy which far, far surpasses every other language in existence
[20:21:42] <apotheon> C is a great language, and Rust doesn't adequately fill all of C's use cases to eliminate C.
[20:21:45] <ProfSimm> pulse: one could argue the same way that PHP is excellent.
[20:21:45] <pulse> like i said the reason i like C is simplicity+power
[20:21:52] <pyzozord> zzz: I can create well organized, modular decopuled and well abstracted code without knowing anything about math
[20:21:55] <pulse> ProfSimm, one could. i wouldn't, though
[20:21:59] <apotheon> C is replaceable, but not by the things people propose as replacements.
[20:22:09] <zzz> pyzozord: how about "you will not write *good* programs"?
[20:22:41] <pyzozord> zzz: hard disagree as well, I meant I can write *great* programs without any math
[20:22:42] <apotheon> PHP is not excellent.
[20:22:48] <pyzozord> as long as the domain problem is not in math
[20:22:50] <ProfSimm> pulse: not to mention C fails to implement basics like polymorphism out of the box. It's all pointers. 
[20:22:58] <pulse> ProfSimm, good. pointers are simple
[20:23:01] <pulse> and powerful
[20:23:03] <apotheon> It's eminently replaceable.  It yields no unique value proposition that is worth the napkin on which it was written.

[20:25:54] <pulse> a principle that is often ignored by modern programmers
[20:25:54] <pyzozord> and if I had to choose only one I'd choose that one
[20:25:56] <karstensrage> C excels at KISS?
[20:25:57] <apotheon> C is replaceable in theory, but what people propose as a replacement doesn't fit.  PHP is eminently replaceable by any number of existing languages because PHP doesn't have a natural fit that is unique in any way.

[20:27:09] <_73> KISS is relative
[20:27:10] <apotheon> PHP's utility was that its standard deployment scheme provided functionality not as easily accessed in other languages at the time.

[20:29:38] <jelly> PHP was at the front end before there was a frontend.
[20:29:39] <tokerboker> just because it couldn't do internet?
[20:29:53] <tokerboker> exactly. it did things well for its time - which is why it was popular.
[20:29:56] <apotheon> What does that have to do with anything?
[20:30:09] <apotheon> I'm not saying there weren't reasons for PHP's popularity.
[20:30:11] <zzz> pyzozord: that's like saying a professional racer has no ise for mechanical knowledge, or that a runner has no use for physics. even if they don't personally, you bet someone an the team does
[20:30:36] <tokerboker> apotheon: instead, i would say - a developer choosing PHP today can make better choices.
[20:30:49] <tokerboker> saying PHP sucks doesn't give the full conttext.

[21:28:41] <Twipply> Surely someone has written a Wordle solver here though
[21:28:47] <apotheon> Is there an official intent of UB -- like "this is undefined, but the intent is that it be treated as 'bad' like an error or at least severe warning, though we understand that hardware constraints may make that difficult"?
[21:29:21] <GeDaMo> It's more like 'this is undefined, do whatever is easier / faster'
[21:29:26] <apotheon> I don't recall seeing anything in the standard that made it especially clear why UB is such a significant "feature".
[21:29:27] <epony> could vary between interpreter-compiler-linker bundles
[21:29:32] *** Joins: va5c0 (~vasco.nun@162.154-253-62.static.virginmediabusiness.co.uk)
[21:29:50] <apotheon> I know that it can vary.
[21:30:03] <apotheon> UB can be pretty much anything.  That's why it's called "undefined".
[21:30:04] <epony> it's just an indication of "machines can be different"
[21:30:11] <apotheon> . . .
[21:30:15] <apotheon> That doesn't even address my question.
[21:30:26] <epony> that is the real intent
[21:30:47] <bjs> apotheon: the intent is to allow compiler writers to make assumptions without having to do checks.
[21:31:09] <apotheon> so basically compilation resource/time performance
[21:31:16] <apotheon> and easier implementation
[21:31:33] <apotheon> "This is a shortcut we can take."
[21:31:33] <bjs> apotheon: well it's really there to allow compiler writers to make more aggressive optimizations that might otherwise not be possible without runtime checks
[21:31:45] <koollman> apotheon: UB is UB. you can read it as "we did not reach consensus on what should happen there", if you want
[21:31:46] <epony> not relying or expecting machines to be "the same" with the non-specific / non-standard behaviour where they differ
[21:32:14] <apotheon> I think epony is not getting the question.
[21:32:21] <koollman> sometimes it's a bit more intentionnal than that, such as some machines may go faster if you don't enforce the behavior
[21:32:26] <bjs> apotheon: "If we assume you never access out of bounds, we can unroll this loop over an array of length 16 exactly 16 times and eliminate this check here" and stuff like that
[21:33:03] <apotheon> It just feels like UB is such a rattlesnake's nest that one should assiduously avoid relying on any code that produces it and, as such, it's a bit strange to not cordon that shit off somehow.
[21:33:38] <epony> maybe not getting the answer :-) but there also exist unspecified machine code operands (undefined instructions too)
[21:33:41] <koollman> apotheon: but it is cordonned off. the standard says you shouldn't do it :)
[21:33:45] <apotheon> Are there cases where it's a good idea to intentionally rely on some implementation's particular handling of UB?
[21:33:58] <apotheon> koollman: I mean practical, not merely formal, cordoning.
[21:34:06] <bjs> apotheon: you should definitely avoid code that has UB, because the point is that you're promising to the compiler that your code doesn't have UB.  That said, there's a lot of code out there that does things "outside" of C's remit that is technically UB
[21:34:12] <koollman> apotheon: when you want something efficient, sometimes. Or you don't want to spend time testing

[21:34:52] <bjs> They're using the same word but it means something very different.
[21:34:59] <apotheon> koollman: so . . . no, there's not really a good excuse for serious code
[21:35:00] <epony> who's talking about ARM? ;-)
[21:35:12] <bjs> epony: you said "machine code operands" and I'm giving a specific example
[21:35:32] <epony> does not fit any standardisation and was not present when C was standardised
[21:35:40] <bjs> epony: what?
[21:35:45] <koollman> apotheon: depends how serious it is. you can rely on it if you can bring more guarantees than the standard. typical would be "if code is compiled in this kind of platform, do that"
[21:36:29] <koollman> apotheon: like, you can have a standard-compliant function, and some alternative implementations that are technically UB but relying on known/verifiable things
[21:36:31] <bjs> epony: I mean it's not like they just appeared magically one day, they both evolved together.  But my point still stands, that when C says "UB" it means something specific and that specific idea does not appear in your hardware.
[21:36:44] <apotheon> koollman: I might just not work enough in areas where that makes sense, but my general take is that when I see UB in code I stop working with that code unless I'm allowed to write the UB out.
[21:36:51] <bjs> ISAs really can't have UB for a variety of reasons, some practical and some security reasons
[21:36:52] <abraxis> the committee's listed reasons for UB are: so implementors don't have to catch hard to diagnose errors, to avoid defining edge cases that would favor one implementation over the other, and to allow implementors to define the behavior themselves
[21:36:59] <epony> noshit, you know C was invented and standardised before some ARM CPU was "the example"

[22:05:13] <pyzozord> I feel like machnie specific is still a broad category
[22:05:21] <koollman> oh, very much so
[22:05:24] <pyzozord> sure some people need to write for x64 and arm
[22:05:34] <pyzozord> but then it's still two specific machines
[22:05:42] <pyzozord> but don't most people just write x64
[22:05:45] <koollman> even just on x86_64, there are many possibilities :)
[22:05:46] <bjs> pyzozord: there's a difference here in that, if it's implementation-defined you can say "ah, I know my CPU is 2's complement and so that's how the overflow will happen"
[22:05:52] <bjs> pyzozord: whereas with UB you go "oh, I guess I can't overflow then"
[22:05:56] <koollman> (or, worse, 'just arm' :) )
[22:05:56] <bjs> or dragons
[22:06:08] *** Joins: clarjon1 (~clarjon1@user/clarjon1)
[22:06:48] <pyzozord> isn't UB, UB only if you consider strict adherence to standard and full portability?
[22:06:54] <bjs> pyzozord: in C signed integer overflow is the latter,  even if you know your CPU uses 2's complement and everything assumes 2's complement you're not allowed to use that information to deduce what happens in the event of an overflow of a signed integer.
[22:07:24] <koollman> pyzozord: well, it lose the meaning in most other places. it becomes 'point of interest to look/test for'
[22:07:30] <pyzozord> if you constrain yourself to a specific ISA(s) and specific compiler(s) and specific OS(es), you don't have UB anymore, no?
[22:07:38] <bjs> pyzozord: no that is a common misunderstanding.
[22:07:49] <koollman> pyzozord: you still do. read the last link I gave :)
[22:08:12] <koollman> you could restrict yourself to compilers that don't try to be smart, sure
[22:08:15] <koollman> but that's quite limiting
[22:08:18] <bjs> pyzozord: UB exists to help compilers do optimizations, if the compiler does optimizations then you really can't rely on anything you know about the underlying hardware
[22:08:42] *** Joins: flakland (~flaknet99@32.211.211.39)
[22:08:57] <pyzozord> oh but you can still test te optimized code to figure out what it does in practice
[22:09:02] <pyzozord> (or read disassmebly)
[22:09:11] <bjs> pyzozord: because e.g. for signed-integer overflow the compiler can go "ah when you go x++ I know it can't wrap around and so I'll move this over here, and not do the increment at all" and so suddenly the fact you know how the hardware does the overflow doesn't matter because the code doesn't overflow anymore
[22:09:15] <bjs> and instead does something wrong
[22:09:15] <GeDaMo> A leter version of the same compiler may do something different
[22:09:25] <GeDaMo> ^later
[22:09:33] <bjs> pyzozord: sure, and if you take the compiled output and manually check it then you can do sensible things and quite often you basically have to
[22:09:35] <koollman> pyzozord: sure. but it is hard for any decently large program, and it's something you have to test for every possible combination of version and flag and platform
[22:09:39] <deniska> or just changing some line nearby may make the UB change
[22:10:12] <koollman> well, and code, too, sure. At that point, you may consider writing in something much less difficult to test, like assembly :)
[22:10:17] <epony> bjs, I guess it was someone else mentioning it then  Feb14 1812<pulse> koollman, what if you get a 60% perf boost by using the UB option, is that worth it then? :p
[22:10:31] <pyzozord> koollman: it sounds to me like it's less hard than the maths of figuring out UB
[22:10:36] <bjs> epony: what about that statement?
[22:10:40] <pyzozord> sure more busy work, but easier work
[22:10:59] <pyzozord> and easier work is more automatable
[22:11:13] <tokerboker> but lower prioritized
[22:11:20] <bjs> pyzozord: yes, being able to look at C code and spot UB is hard and a skill that people pay a lot for in professional C programmers
[22:11:21] <koollman> pyzozord: no, it's much worse. you figure out UB once, not add it to your code, and go on, knowing that it works on many untested platform combinations
[22:11:44] <koollman> pyzozord: or, you add it to your code once, and then have to keep fighting to test every possible configuration you haven't thought of yet
[22:11:59] <tokerboker> apotheon: i hope you didnt get too offended. i was just lightening my mood before this meeting.
[22:12:01] <bjs> pyzozord: that said, UB is an important and useful part of C and it's not going to go away anytime soon
[22:12:02] <pyzozord> koollman: still the first one sounds harder to me
[22:12:23] <bjs> pyzozord: it's one of the things that allows the compilers to be so aggressive in their optimizations and the benefits of that are clear to see
[22:12:27] <apotheon> tokerboker: Don't lighten your mood at others' expense.  It's shitty behavior.
[22:12:28] <epony> bjs, let the people cool off and we'll make the conclusions ;-)
[22:12:32] <koollman> pyzozord: well, it is not. I'm not sure how to convince you of that
[22:12:35] <FreeFull> other programming languages get away with not having UB unless you opt into it
[22:12:59] <koollman> pyzozord: but more reasonably, you pick some 'more defined', more restrictive language, that helps a lot

[22:14:18] <FreeFull> Gotta keep in mind C is a language from the 1970s at its heart, I guess
[22:14:32] <bjs> FreeFull: yeah but even if it was invented today, it'd probably still have UB

[22:14:36] <tokerboker> depends on how we each define trolling.
[22:14:38] <FreeFull> But it's definitely possible to optimise code nowadays without needing UB
[22:14:47] <koollman> pyzozord: you have to realize that you have, like, millions of test to do just to make sure your program containing one UB part just keep on working without modifying it. It's pretty insane
[22:14:59] <tokerboker> you could avoid it being at your expense by not being too serious about it.

[22:15:21] <apotheon> The term "trolling" comes from "trolling for flames", like a fishing boat may troll for fish -- casting a net and dragging it along to see what fish you catch.
[22:15:25] <FreeFull> Heya rindolf, been well
[22:15:31] <apotheon> How do you get flames?  You get them by affecting other people.
[22:15:36] <koollman> pyzozord: it is much easier to maintain it by compiling once to assembly and maintaining that, and 'nobody' do that because it's hard already :)
[22:15:40] <apotheon> It's implicit in the definition of trolling.
[22:15:45] <tokerboker> i get flames from matchstick and matchbox
[22:15:50] <perro_> zig is a modern take
[22:15:54] <tokerboker> i dont need to get people involved to get flames
[22:16:01] <koollman> pyzozord: but at least the assembly form is somewhat more fixed in behavior :)
[22:16:04] <apotheon> If you want literal flames, stay off the internet and play with matches.

[22:17:04] <tokerboker> i am totally happy with you ignoring me and not responding.
[22:17:13] <FreeFull> Most kernels are written in C++

[22:17:55] <pyzozord> tokerboker: it takes effort to be nice
[22:17:55] <perro_> it's boring for everyone else
[22:18:06] <koollman> pyzozord: first, for part of the UB, they cheat by fixing part of the platform (after all, they aren't OS independant :) ). Also they rarely work on multiple compilers, or just a restricted list. They are rarely standard C, too
[22:18:17] <FreeFull> They try to be really careful, and also do a bunch of testing, and also pass in special compiler flags to try and avoid unintended stuff
[22:18:19] <deniska> linux is in C, NT is probably C++, but I'm not downloading the leaked source :)
[22:18:23] <FreeFull> But bugs still sneak through anyway
[22:18:23] <tokerboker> i am nice generally. but i dont like people using **** words in an otherwise nice convo.
[22:18:24] <koollman> pyzozord: and then, they get pretty pretty good at hunting down UB

[22:18:44] <deniska> SerenityOS is in C++, aggressively following newer standards

[23:14:47] <koollman> sonny: or ... I assume you're from the 21st century and have usable email that solves that problem completely at account creation
[23:14:54] <pyzozord> then after I built up some math muscle I can go back and start learning some computation theory and algorithms
[23:15:06] <koollman> because maybe I don't want to deal with "but I want my account back!" users:)
[23:15:11] <pyzozord> after that maybe I'll be finally free to pursue my curiosity again
[23:15:17] <sonny> 2FA is also a way to always be able to sign in
[23:15:28] <pyzozord> language design, operating systems, 3d graphics those would be the first ones
[23:15:32] <koollman> and, sure, for some options there are alternatives. my bank don't need my email, but that's quite a different relationship
[23:16:02] <pyzozord> there is awesome book on computer architecture I want to read
[23:16:19] <pyzozord> very many programming and software engineering books
[23:16:31] <absentia> harris & harris - digital design & computer architecture
[23:16:34] <absentia> very great book
[23:16:41] <pyzozord> and that's just the beggining of the computer science stuff
[23:16:44] <absentia> from boolean math to superscalar processors
[23:16:48] <absentia> yes
[23:16:48] <koollman> sonny: sure. but if I make 2fa a requirement at account creation I probably lose more potential users than if I just ask for an email as account name, or at account creation
[23:16:49] <sonny> I agree with apotheon, I'm seeing little reason for identity to be connected to online services
[23:16:56] <absentia> i also use barbs
[23:16:57] <pyzozord> i'd also like to read some non-computer stuff

[23:17:38] <absentia> all the things to learn
[23:17:40] <absentia> wooooooooooo
[23:17:46] <adder``> pyzozord, just for the math stuff you listed, you're going to need about 2 years of 8-hour a day work
[23:17:48] <sonny> koollman: is the impact that large?
[23:17:56] <absentia> i'm going to download fucking 50 exabytes of books
[23:18:00] *** Quits: smoke_ (~smoke@user/smoke) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:18:03] <absentia> and stream them into my fucking hippocampus
[23:18:16] <koollman> sonny: yes. imagine the average user. Then remember you are probably optimistic about humans in general ;)
[23:18:20] <adder``> pyzozord, assuming you know high school mathematics
[23:18:20] *** Joins: smoke_ (~smoke@user/smoke)
[23:18:33] <adder``> pyzozord, if not, add + 3 years for high school math
[23:18:40] <kittyn> you only lose careless users if making that a requirement turns some away...nobody will fault you for requiring decent security hygiene 
[23:18:49] <pyzozord> absentia: I think I meant Computer Architecture by Hennessy and Patterson, but I might be wrong
[23:18:53] <koollman> sonny: but, sure, feel free to do it. I've used services with no email linkage before. simple rules. account lost, account ... lost :)
[23:19:01] <sonny> yeah
[23:19:26] <sonny> I have a target audience I'm gonna go ask
[23:20:04] <koollman> sonny: specific services can do better than that. typically, linking to phone, address, actual human interaction, or something else
[23:20:47] <pyzozord> adder``: I actually don't, at least not well enough but I believe Basic Math by Lang and Khan Academy I could maybe make 3 years into say 6 months. I do know a bit, and I do have 15 years of experience programming, that can count for at least some neuroplasticty in my brain to help me follow the stuff a bit quicker (as well as skipping some less important interesting bits)
[23:21:01] <koollman> sonny: but for the average user... email is easy, almost everyone understand it and it is not surprising for anyone
[23:21:29] <apotheon> I'm totally okay with email as an *option* for account recovery in many cases, but making it a mandatory part of signup seems less than ideal.
[23:21:31] <sonny> yeah, except people my age hate email ... so there's that too lol
[23:21:55] <koollman> apotheon: compared to no recovery option ? or enforcing another option at signup ?
[23:22:15] <KillerWasp> all here are neurotic
[23:22:15] <koollman> because lets be realistic, people having a hard time dealing with email won't set up another option if you let them not do it
[23:22:16] <pyzozord> adder``: oh and I don't have 8h a day. I got around three, and that assuming perfect dyscipline, and magical mental strength to actually learn these heavy subjects after full day of programming

[23:23:09] <smoke_> i'll take mandatory email over mandatory phone number any day
[23:23:13] <koollman> apotheon: and if that was as easy as this, sure. But people don't want risk or responsiblity, they want things working without thinking about it. in general ;)
[23:23:25] <apotheon> So?
[23:23:26] <KillerWasp> the fresh day are end. now is the hell.
[23:23:33] <KillerWasp> really is a hell here.
[23:23:40] <koollman> apotheon: so, picking the easy thing is easy
[23:23:45] <apotheon> So?
[23:23:54] <koollman> that's it. that's my whole point, I think
[23:23:59] <apotheon> I'm fine with that.
[23:24:17] <mrig> KillerWasp: so just concatenate an 'o' on the end :)
[23:24:18] <koollman> I agree that you can do it differently, but then you have to deal with users not understanding the choices they made
[23:24:24] <apotheon> Now let me sign up without trying to tie my account to some other identity if that's what I want.
[23:24:38] <absentia> ultimately you're going to have to pay for this shit
[23:24:46] <adder``> pyzozord, good luck with learning all you listed in 6 months investing 3 hours per day :p
