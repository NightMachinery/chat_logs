[00:00:15] <cq-work> GTK has no supported docking framework anymore actually
[00:00:18] <rpav> also apacheoffice, staroffice still exists, google, microsoft, ...
[00:00:22] <Guest3896> GUI librares? how many? QT and GTK mostly
[00:01:04] <LordKalma> wow, discussing UI and I didn't trigger it? amazing
[00:01:05] <Guest3896> [17:25:13] <cq-work> It's because UI libraries aren't trivial and they're tedious/resource-consuming to make. --> have you tried Qt tools?
[00:01:38] <cq-work> Yes, I've used them for many years.
[00:02:16] <Guest3896> rpav: I don't know why you said "not always the case" twice; I said "tend"
[00:02:17] <cq-work> And you know what? Out all the god-awful rapid UI tools, it's probably the least awful.
[00:02:22] <cq-work> That doesn't really say much though.
[00:03:32] <Guest3896> cq-work: you mean having different separate windows on GIMP whih was not native?
[00:04:32] <Guest3896> rpav: but we are talking, as I said, of Libre soft
[00:04:37] <cq-work> Correct, GIMP, which is what GTK was based around, had to implement a docking framework outside of the toolkit to get docking to work

[00:05:41] <cq-work> None of them really have decent docking support, doesn't seem to be favored now adays.

[00:07:03] <Guest3896> cq-work: I had some tiny problems with docking in GIMP, if I am getting it well, but lately seems normal
[00:07:12] <cq-work> It's a scalability nightmare, it has no concern with modern practice, it uses every unorthodox practice in the book including but not limited too unintuitive macros, their own C++ parser for headers, awful build system support, gigantic binaries that are miserable to distribute, the list just never ends
[00:08:27] <cq-work> It wasn't until Qt6 that going between an std::string and QString wasn't verbose and error-prone. Multiply that times every single utility in Qt and it's a fucking nightmare.
[00:08:30] <rpav> it's just all over the place .. signals? callbacks? variants? some other random bullshit? their CSS hack?
[00:08:42] <Guest3896> cq-work: if all that is true.. what would be the alternative libre?
[00:08:49] <cq-work> There is no alternative.
[00:08:51] <rpav> no one's saying there's an alternative
[00:08:52] <cq-work> That's the problem.

[00:10:20] <rpav> gtk _could_ be an option, it just doesn't really have the support
[00:10:30] <Friithian> gtk bad
[00:10:32] <LordKalma> I'll try gtk when it builds without mingw
[00:10:34] <rpav> lacking focus on windows and a C++ api
[00:11:08] <Guest3896> oh, now mingw is bad??
[00:11:28] <Guest3896> come on, libre soft is not a paradise

[00:12:24] <Guest3896> remember when linux appeared: was not perfect; lots of problems; but was an alternative
[00:12:24] <cq-work> Just because something is libre doesn't mean it's not capable of being crap.
[00:12:47] <rpav> probably sortof the opposite if you count every failed project ;)
[00:12:50] <Guest3896> you have: either monopoly or fight for an alternative

[00:13:39] <Guest3896> you don't like C + QT? go to C# :D
[00:13:49] <Guest3896> or C++ Builder maybe
[00:13:56] <Guest3896> whch seems much better
[00:14:00] <cq-work> C++ Builder is not a good time.

[00:15:11] <Guest3896> of course if you get version 0.2 it will have lots of problems

[00:19:16] <Guest3896> it is known that sometimes when some people buy some things... things start going bad suspiciously

[07:00:42] <Alipha> mike18: so, I haven't tried to understand what your code is doing, but what I'd do is: iterate over the blue tapes. If the blue tapes overlap the red tape(s), then adjust the range that the red tape covers. This may mean that a blue tape splits the red tape into two parts. Repeat this for each blue tape, which may mean you'd have to check multiple red tapes as you progress. This would be O(n) in the
[07:00:44] <Alipha> number of blue tapes. Though for every blue tape, you may be checking m red tapes
[07:01:38] <mike18> does that word for multiple red and blue tapes?
[07:02:15] <Alipha> mike18: if it's concerned that there will be many red tape fragments, then you may want to store them in a std::map so that you can search the red tapes in O(log n) time
[07:02:17] <Alipha> Yes
[07:03:53] <mike18> how to search it?
[07:04:06] <mike18> you have a start and end

[07:06:58] <Alipha> mike18: so, the red tapes you wouldn't have to worry about them overlapping, since you'd start with only one red tape and only end up splitting them up. And so, you can sort each range by the start value (or the end value)
[07:07:27] <mike18> you mean sort blue tapes?

[07:07:39] <mike18> i guess red here
[07:08:34] <mike18> also how does. splitting help?
[07:09:17] <Alipha> Oh, and I mean std::set instead of std::map
[07:10:02] <Alipha> You want to maintain a std::set of the visible ranges of the red tapes
[07:10:17] <mike18> each point?
[07:10:20] <mike18> from start to end?
[07:10:43] *** Quits: Emet-Selch (~haise01@user/haise01) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:11:01] <mike18> lets say i have red: 1------5
[07:12:23] <Alipha> If you have a blue tape of 3-4, then the visible red ranges would be 1-3 and 4-5
[07:12:54] <mike18> ok
[07:13:25] <mike18> and what would be in the set?
[07:13:48] <mike18> single numbers or a string?
[07:14:51] <Alipha> The set would contain `struct range { int start; int end; };`
[07:15:34] <mike18> ok and how does that help for the next blue tape?
[07:15:52] <mike18> lets ay i have 0----3
[07:16:12] <Alipha> So the set would initially contain a single element, [1,5]. Then after the first blue tape mentioned above, it'd contain [1,3] and [4,5]
[07:17:21] <mike18> but only 4-5 is covered by blue so far
[07:17:25] <Alipha> You'd loop over the blue tapes and for each blue tape, use std::set::lower_bound to find the closest red tape ranges in the std::set to the blue tape
[07:17:47] <mike18> i mean 3-4
[07:18:39] <mike18> and check if they overlap?
[07:24:59] <mike18> also how do you know if all of the red is covered?

[07:27:32] <mike18> but in the first step you would split the range of red:
[07:27:34] <mike18> If you have a blue tape of 3-4, then the visible red ranges would be 1-3 and 4-5

[18:30:13] <Alipha> what's wrong people. there's only been 3 messages in the past 10.5 hours
[18:31:35] <AmR> I need help with cmake please
[18:32:04] <rpav> AmR: ask a specific question
[18:32:05] <rpav>  
[18:35:11] <PJBoy> he wants to use a library that has a sqllite3 dependency
[18:35:27] <PJBoy> and he wants for that sqllite to be a different sqllite than the one the library uses
[18:35:59] <rpav> that sounds less like a cmake question and more like a "how do i fork/port this" question
[18:36:01] <PJBoy> but he doesn't want to edit the library's cmake file
[18:36:57] <mort> linking two versions of sqlite3 into the same library sounds like a disaster
[18:37:15] <mort> or, I may have misread, idk
[18:38:24] <vdamewood> I've seen enough help vampirism to ignore this one.
[18:38:39] <PJBoy> I believe he wants to replace the library's dependency on sqllite with a different sqllite
[18:38:48] <PJBoy> so only the one sqllite will be about
[18:39:09] <rpav> vdamewood: yeah but i'm impressed by PJBoy's apparent telepathy ;)
[18:39:32] <PJBoy> it's pretty good right?
[18:39:38] <PJBoy> my free trial ends today
[18:39:43] <rpav> yeah you should consult (;
[18:42:19] <mort> one could always circumvent cmake and make the compilation of the library be handled by one's own makefile
[18:42:57] <mort> (or one's own CMakeLists.txt if one is into that)

[18:44:12] <mort> some libraries are complicated but most are just gonna be running the compiler on every source file and then link the objects, you can totally handle that yourself

[22:33:09] <PJBoy> members of anonymous unions have internal linkage

[22:42:06] <PJBoy> the more awkward case would have been `struct S { static const x{}; };`
[22:42:14] <PJBoy> that one has external linkage
[22:42:39] <PJBoy> well it would if I declared it as an int
[22:43:17] <cq-work> I've learned things today that perhaps... I may have been better off not thinking about.
[22:44:18] <PJBoy> there's also the case of `namespace { extern int x{}; };` which has internal linkage
[22:44:38] <rpav> call of c++
[22:45:20] <PJBoy> then there's module linkage, which I haven't even looked at
[22:45:49] <yolo> cq-work: just playing with exception concepts here not (never used it) in snippet code, looks like in one try-catch any one exception will exit this try-catch block(i.e. there is no way to go back to the original code flow for some non-fatal exceptions)

[22:47:14] <PJBoy> yeah you can't go back to where an exception was thrown, that would be a coroutine-like operation

[22:48:32] <yolo> I consider it's a limitation for exceptions, error-checking can easily ignore and log non-fatal erros and move on
[22:48:42] * yolo back to -fnon-exception flag
[22:48:47] <PJBoy> non-sense
[22:50:19] <rpav> yolo: a bit like saying "a function will only allow one return value through at a time"
[22:50:25] <PJBoy> `error_t f() { return error_t::non_fatal; return error_t::fatal; } void g() { error_t err = f(); if (err == error_t::non_fatal) { cout << "blah blah"; } if (err == error_t::fatal) { cout << "unreachable"; }` would be the parallel
[22:50:33] <rpav> i mean, _yeah_, but how would you like it to be otherwise
[22:51:13] <rpav> i do favor top-of-the-stack exceptions and error handling, which would allow correctible errors, but that's hard in C++

[23:14:48] <Alipha> you could create some framework where instead of doing `throw Foo("message");` you do `handle_error<Foo>("message");` which would check some global map to see if there's an error handler registered for Foo. if so, that's run. otherwise, it throws the exception
