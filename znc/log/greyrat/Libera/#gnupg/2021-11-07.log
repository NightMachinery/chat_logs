[02:47:21] <nashimus> If my signing key is expired, is there any way to sign a new signing key with a newer expiration date? It seems unlikely, but I figured I'd ask before starting over.
[02:47:47] <nashimus> e.g. Use my expired signing key to sign a newer signing key.
[02:48:25] <henk> extend your expired key
[02:49:06] <nashimus> oh wow, I didn't realize that was possible.
[02:50:04] <nashimus> Looks like that will definitely be the path of least resistance. Thanks henk.

[16:29:41] <nashimus> Okay, so I was able to use the expire command to set a new expiration date on my master key (signing) and a subkey (encryption). I also sent to pgp server which looks good. Used keytocard to send the updated keys to the card.
[16:30:58] <nashimus> I have a second card I was hoping to setup as a backup. I was able to use keytocard to send the signing key to it, but the encryption key states "gpg: KEYTOCARD failed: No secret key", despite stating "Secret key is avaialble." when I initiated gpg --edit-key...
[16:32:08] <nashimus> I was careful not to save after using keytocard on the signing key, so I'm not sure what I'm missing.
[16:35:37] <nashimus> I am thinking it might be best to just generate all new subkeys. I was really only interested in keeping the same master key to sign the keys, anyhow.
[16:39:01] <henk> can you show what exactly happened on a pastebin?
[16:41:25] <nashimus> Yes, one moment.

[17:00:48] <nashimus> sent via pm, did it make it?
[17:03:19] <henk> nashimus: yes. that excludes everyone else from participating in the conversation here now ): donâ€™t like that â€¦ anyway: it shows 'ssb#' for your enc subkey, meaning itâ€™s not really there, so the message is right.
[17:05:27] <nashimus> Okay. So when I was editing the key, it was referring to the parent key when it said "Secret key is available."
[17:05:30] <nashimus> Right, I can understand that.
[17:05:43] <nashimus> I was just paranoid about oversharing.
[17:06:13] <henk> yeah, I know
[17:07:25] <nashimus> Thanks for the help, it's appreciated.
[17:09:00] <henk> youâ€™re welcome

[17:11:27] <nashimus> So, I don't think I actually backed up the secret for the subkey 3 years ago... *facepalm*. By using gpg --edit-key on the parent key and gpg> expire, I managed to update the expiration date for the subkey. If that is possible, it seems like I could also, use the parent key to revoke the subkey. Is that correct?
[17:16:00] <henk> I think so, yes. revocation should be capability [C]ertification
[17:16:34] <nashimus> Wonderful, I'll give it a shot. :)
