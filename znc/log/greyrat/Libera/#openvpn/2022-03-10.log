[18:47:39] <yogg> Hi
[18:48:07] <yogg> Is there a way to list all "iroute(s)" on an openvpn server?
[18:49:06] <yogg> like "route -n" for the kernel routes
[18:50:18] <yogg> I already connected via telnet to the management port, but can't find an option to list the openvpn internal routes

[19:42:29] <yogg> ? "netstat -r" shows the routes of the system (like "route -n" or "ip route list") but I need the iroute table from openvpn (openvpn has an internal routing table)
[19:44:47] <Poster> assuming this is Linux and it's using iproute2, you can look in /etc/iproute2/rt_tables for a table not local/main/default/unspec and/or examine the output of "ip rule show" to see if there are designators that apply to your installation
[19:47:12] <ordex> yogg: I am not sure iroute are advertised anywhere
[19:47:15] <ordex> *iroutes*
[19:47:34] <Poster> If you do find some other type, you can display it's contents with "ip route show table xxx" where xxx is the table name
[19:48:48] <ordex> Poster: he's asking about iroutes, not the system routes
[19:49:00] * Poster stands corrected
[19:49:17] <ordex> iroutes are openvpn internal routes that are not exported to the system routing table but live inside the openvpn process only
[19:49:39] <Poster> gotcha, have never used those =S
[19:49:57] <ordex> they are needed when you have extra networks behind a client
[19:50:21] <Poster> yeah I could see that, have seen something similar with softether
[19:51:16] <ordex> yogg: the mgmt interface should print something everytime a new iroute is added though
[19:52:06] <yogg> ordex: I try to set the verbosity higher on "2" I did not see anything
[19:52:09] <yogg> thx
