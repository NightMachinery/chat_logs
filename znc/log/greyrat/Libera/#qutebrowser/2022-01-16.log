[15:44:51] <nimaje> guido: seems like you also have to convert that expires_utc field to have it fully correct, because chrome uses some strange start of epoch value and stores it in subsecond acuraccy https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43518199/cookies-expiration-time-format so using   (expires_utc / 1000000) - 11644473600   should work
[15:46:01] <guido> weird
[15:48:56] <guido> https://gist.github.com/guidocella/a272b6e68f9c44532b011f6596e95c61 updated
[16:17:39] <nimaje> also to that stuff about domain having to begin with a dot I could only find a warning in some third party docs (http://docs.w3af.org/en/latest/authentication.html#setting-http-cookie), and that assert in pythons cookiejar parser (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/Lib/http/cookiejar.py#L2058) but that only applies if the include subdomains field is true (hardcoded to true in your
[16:17:41] <nimaje> script), but how does webengine/chrome save that include subdomains stuff in the db?
[16:20:42] <guido> yeah I have no idea what I originally based this script on, I didn't even know there was a include subdomains field
[16:21:02] <guido> it worked with curl so whatever
[16:22:55] <guido> ok I remember, I based it on https://github.com/n8henrie/pycookiecheat/blob/master/src/pycookiecheat/pycookiecheat.py
[16:23:08] <guido> that also hardcodes includes subdomains to true
[16:23:19] <nimaje> seems like   iif(host_key LIKE '.%', 'TRUE', 'FALSE')   for the second field would be more correct, but I didn't find a spec for chromes cookie db
[16:25:15] <guido> pycookiecheat also just leaves expires_utc as it is stored
[16:27:04] <guido> it seems that for each row it outputs multiple row, with and without a leading . and with and without any subdomain. see the end of that script
[16:38:26] <nimaje> no, it just filters for all matching cookies  `"from cookies where host_key like ?"`  that generator just generates the host_key values for that sql
[16:41:55] <guido> oh yeah, that only dumps cookies for one domain
