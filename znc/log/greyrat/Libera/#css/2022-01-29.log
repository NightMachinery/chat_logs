[18:45:13] <barkle> is it possible to override pseudo element i.e. :before, styles in an inline element's style attribute ?

[19:47:31] <eXtr3m0> barkle It's possible my adding a class to the parent OR [if you need dynamic values] use a custom property.
[19:47:56] <eXtr3m0> depending on the thing you want to do.

[19:51:00] <eXtr3m0> I surprised myself, because I thought custom property definitions are not being inherited by pseudo elements. hmmmm
[19:51:47] <Andrew> With https://fcm.andrewyu.org/certs/, I'm trying to rotate the beaglebone black image clockwise ninety degrees.  I added a class 'clockwise' that does this (transform: rotate(90deg);) and tried applying it to both the <img /> and the <div class="imagewrap"></div> (which was necessary to center the image) one at a time.  However, after rotation, the <div></div>'s height is still that of the original
[19:51:49] <Andrew> image, not the rotated one...
[19:55:15] <eXtr3m0> Andrew that is because transform will change the appearance of the element, but not it's document flow. like when you set something to position:relative; and set top to 200, it will displayed at another position but still use its original space in the flow.
[19:55:36] <Andrew> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking
[19:55:40] <Andrew> :\
[19:55:48] <eXtr3m0> Or when you set something to display:none, it's now part of the flow anymore but if you set it to visibility:hidden instead, it just wont be displayed but is still part of the flow.
[19:56:15] <eXtr3m0> **not

[19:56:56] <eXtr3m0> Andrew if you are not looking for a universal solution, you could just change other properties of this element to reduce the gap.
[19:57:10] <Andrew> That's sounds ugly
[19:57:49] <Andrew> I'm looking for a safer and more general way...
[19:57:55] <Andrew> I guess transform: isn't gonna work here
[19:57:57] <eXtr3m0> -imagewrap: margin: -50px auto;
[19:58:46] <Andrew> ... lol, I mean I thought of that, but I come from (La)TeX, so that's not a good idea

[19:59:31] <eXtr3m0> I agree.
[20:00:41] <Andrew> It may have something to do with overflows, personal feeling
[20:00:50] <eXtr3m0> Interesting problem. I can see how one would expect that to be straight forward.

[20:02:25] <eXtr3m0> Couldn't you just rotate if in Photoshop or something and then include it?
[20:02:32] <barkle> i have a div inside a wrapper div. how can I make the top border of the wrapper div be hidden from x0 to 60% or such ?
[20:03:24] <eXtr3m0> barkle can you share a fiddle? border gradients is a thing
[20:03:43] <eXtr3m0> like this https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/XodmyY
[20:04:00] <Andrew> No, I want to use the image from other people's site ()
[20:04:35] <eXtr3m0> Andrew but you're not rotating them all, right? So there is manual labor?
[20:05:02] <eXtr3m0> Andrew you could also write a proxy script, for example in PHP, that rotates the image dynamically for you if needed.
[20:05:06] <Andrew> eXtr3m0: No, I'm not rotating it from GIMP or anything, I'm trying to rotate it with CSS
[20:05:17] <Andrew> I'll just look into CSS for now
[20:05:38] <eXtr3m0> Yes but you are not applying the styles to all images I see.
[20:05:48] <eXtr3m0> So how is it being detected that an image needs to be rotated?
[20:06:24] <Andrew> <Stack overflow> 1
[20:06:26] <Andrew> There's no way to do it right (with css alone)
[20:06:28] <Andrew> Yay.
[20:06:34] <Andrew> Detected? class="clockwise"?
[20:06:41] <eXtr3m0> yes
[20:06:52] <eXtr3m0> so manual labor, because you apply that class

[20:07:17] <Andrew> So...?
[20:07:20] <Andrew> I'll try overflow:hidden
[20:07:37] <eXtr3m0> I meant you are not rotating them all at the same time
[20:07:48] <eXtr3m0> you need to manually review them and add that class manually

[20:10:03] <eXtr3m0> Well if all of it is a manual process, there are different considerations compared to when you import the content in some form of automation where it would be possible to get extra information
[20:10:14] <eXtr3m0> that extra information might help you to create a dynamic css solution.

[20:13:25] *** Quits: xse (~xse@user/xse) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:13:48] <eXtr3m0> for example min(--width, --height) would always give you the shorter side.
[20:14:14] <eXtr3m0> But yeah, tricky tricky. Better to do it outside of CSS.
[20:14:45] <Andrew> min... good idea
[20:15:07] <Andrew> (except that it's fun to access the properties of img to set the height of div.imagewrap)
[20:15:15] *** Joins: xse (~xse@user/xse)
[20:15:44] <eXtr3m0> yeah it would only be possible if during automated import width/height are determined and put into the html markup.
[20:15:57] <eXtr3m0> if that is not possible, you'd need some manual labor I think
[20:16:02] <eXtr3m0> NOt sure. I go sleep as well
