[20:59:45] <rapha> ruby has been called dead so many times...
[21:00:07] <rapha> yet there will always be tasks for which you'd always rather use ruby than python
[21:00:35] <rapha> havenwood: pycall is amazing! much more fun to use than what i had imagined!
[21:03:01] <ccooke> Languages live or die on niches and use cases. Right now, Python has a few that are propelling adoption. Ruby doesn't have any big ...slices of the zeitgeist (for want of a better idiom) at the moment, but it's still big enough a language to survive for a long time yet
[21:04:26] <rapha> a lot of the non-western-scripts work i do would be so much more cumbersome in python
[21:05:00] <rapha> but none of the microcontrollers-and-numerical-data stuff i like to do in my free time would be much fun in ruby
[21:05:39] <rapha> so the more these two languages can interact with each other, the better for everybody
[21:13:17] <rapha> havenwood: how do you turn a python list that you got via pycall into a proper ruby array?
