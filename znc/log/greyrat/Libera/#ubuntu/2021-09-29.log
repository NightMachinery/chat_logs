[01:41:43] <tomreyn> cornfeedhobo: normally, you should not mix packages for different releases, because this can cause dependencies not to resolve, or just library incompatibilities. if you know it's safe, though, you can do apt pinning to only whitelist specific packages from specific spt sources.

[01:41:59] <ubottu> pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[01:42:12] <cornfeedhobo> that's exactly what i needed. thank you.
[01:43:08] <oerheks> pinning would require hissuite repos to be added, good luck ..

[04:08:06] <Nitrigaur> tomreyn, Thank you for all the help, but I'm still stuck with the same Grub Cli after reboot in spite of handling cryptsetup and crypttab. It's too late for me now to think clearly (2:36AM where I live) I might try again tomorrow. I could take the more easy way out by not encrypting the boot partition but that would make my initrd vulnerable to outside tampering.

One monitor on VGA out is displaying menu changes instantly and another (DisplayPort to HDMI) monitor is lagging like 5 seconds to forever in displaying menu changes. After boot it works ok, except sometimes, when starting, say, Anydesk it blacks down and comes back up. Is it GRUB problem,

[08:50:48] <nikolam> And how to avoid boot obstruction if file system/disk , that is in /etc/fstab (non-essential) is started missing?
[08:51:18] <alkisg> When grub is running, there's no kernel nor kernel drivers yet. So it would be a grub issue, to be reported in launchpad, or an uefi issue, to be reported in your motherboard's vendor's site
[08:51:35] <nikolam> Every time I put something in /etc/fstab and remove it system behaves like it is a catastrofy and fails to boot.. Whne it is removed from fstab it boots normally.
[08:51:46] <alkisg> What is the fstab line? It depends on if it's local or network mount or user mounted etc
[08:51:48] <nikolam> alkisg, ok thanks

[09:07:30] <nikolam> Yes, there is special option to put the password on GRUB itself, without it, every default Ubuntu install in insecure..
[09:08:46] <alkisg> It depends on how you define "insecure". E.g. if you put a password in grub, are you secured from someone using a livecd to access your disk?

[09:12:35] <nikolam> alkisg, no it's not password to boot. You misunderstood. It's GRUB password to get root through GRUB options.
[09:12:55] <alkisg> Yes, which means that when they return from the kitchen they won't see their desktops
[09:13:05] <nikolam> alkisg, no.
[09:13:09] <alkisg> They'll see a "password" prompt, and THEN the computer will start loading the OS
[09:13:20] <alkisg> Ah you mean about editing grub options, sorry, OK
[09:13:28] <nikolam> GRUB password can be set only for advanced options not for regular boot.
[09:13:32] <nikolam> yes
[09:14:07] <alkisg> Sure I guess also the "Esc" could be cancelled then to avoid the grub shell
[09:14:25] <alkisg> And the password could be shared between distros, as only one of them would manage grub
[09:15:57] <alkisg> On the other hand, the default is to allow usb booting

[21:12:32] <anms> Hey everyone! I'm running into an issue with DHCP networking in 18.04. systemd-NetworkManager gets a 192.168.1.36 address. dhclient -i eth0 gets a 192.168.1.36 address. ifconfig eth0 shows the .36 address. Both the addresses respond to ping and services. /var/lib/dhcp/dhcp.leases shows .37 addresses. Not really sure how to resolve this situation.
