[00:01:00] <programmerq> docker is a thing that runs stuff. set -x is a bash thing. if the stuff you are running in docker is bash, then sure
[00:01:07] <programmerq> without more context, it's hard to say.
[00:01:37] <programmerq> docker's logging system pretty much just shows the stdout/stderr of whatever the thing is that you have containerized.
[00:01:58] <programmerq> so if that thing expands a variable and prints it to stdout, docker just passes it along.

[01:06:29] <rawtaz> im guessing now but i think you could do like  COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=foo docker-compose up -d  several times each time replacing foo with something else
[01:06:32] <ikke> karstensrage: Just copy the directory mutliple times

[01:11:17] <ikke> yes
[01:11:30] <rawtaz> yeah thats one way. downside is redundancy. so another ay is to just control what composer thinks is the project name (which becomes part of all containers, networks etc it creates)

[01:22:02] <rawtaz> physikoi: hmmm anything in particular you are thinking about?
[01:24:11] <rawtaz> on a general note i write all my compose files such that they use variables for anything that should be dynamic of configurable. i use e.g. ${SERVICENAME_VARNAME-defaultvaluehere} for those that should be configable but are optional, and i use just ${SERVICENAME_VARNAME} for those that are mandatory

[01:24:46] <rawtaz> and i always in there set COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=bleh as well
[01:25:16] <rawtaz> so my point is that this way you can reuse the same compose file(s) but you have different configuration in the .env vars depending on which environment you are in
[01:25:32] <rawtaz> in general, using environment to drive configuration and injecting settings is the way to go

Then there's the issue of my sqlite database. Should that even be 
[01:27:13] <physikoi> a part of the docker image? I mean, how would I deploy without losing that data generated from the prior deployment? ... sorry so confused

[01:34:00] <physikoi> rawtaz: to clarify, do you have two separate docker-compose.yml files for development and for production?
[01:34:04] <rawtaz> no
[01:34:12] <rawtaz> same file
[01:34:32] <physikoi> oh
[01:35:45] <rawtaz> i think in general, build the Dockerfile (if any, its not always you need one) and compose file such that you can docker-compose up and the stuff runs like you want it in production.
[01:36:21] <rawtaz> then you use that in your dev env and just replace the .env variables with whatever you use for development db etc. and if you need to start npm then just exec into the running container and execute that manually
[01:37:45] <physikoi> is that to say, the only difference for you might be that you enter a container and execute "npm start" for development (assuming continuous transpilation of typescript, for example)?

[01:41:39] <physikoi> *thinks*
[01:41:50] <rawtaz> one thing where you MIGHT want to have different settings is if e.g. in your production your webapp uses an external mail server to send mail, while in your development you want to use e.g. mailhog to "sent" mail from the webapp. you can then e.g. create a docker-compose.override.yaml (or if it's "overrides", see reference) that contains the mailhog service. compose will read both files

[02:04:55] <physikoi> Does deployment include the .env file, or is that ignored?
[02:05:42] <rawtaz> totally ignored, should not be version controlled
[02:06:26] <rawtaz> that file is just something that docker-compose reads automatically if it's there. its not uncommon to provide/inject environment variables to a process/service by other means.

[02:08:27] <physikoi> ohhhh, ok that helps. i was thinking the .env would be included
[02:09:24] <rawtaz> right. nope nope. then you'd make the mistake so many does, publishing your passwords and other sensitive things on github
[02:09:37] <rawtaz> so consider the .env file a way to *inject* configuration into your compose solution
[02:09:48] <physikoi> so, in that case, i might have a .env that's referenced by the app itself. the way the values are interpolated would then depend on the presence of the /.env at top of project (there for development machine, not for production machine)
[02:10:13] <rawtaz> NOW, once that part is clear, loook at this example. you ahve the app service with the actual webapp yuo made. and you have its database. and in production you set MAIL_SERVER to some external smtp server for sending.
[02:10:46] <rawtaz> but locally when developing you want to test your mails, see what they look like, e.g. so you want to use e.g. mailhog (google it). but that mailhog service isnt in your compose file so its not running. how do you add it you ask?
[02:11:06] <rawtaz> you dont reference the .env file at all, docker automatically reads it and populates the environment.

[02:18:12] <physikoi> ohmygod. OK, so in docker-compose.yml, i might actually define, say, the mail server like this: `MAIL_SERVER: ${MAIL_SERVER:-mail.mysite.com}`. In development, MAIL_SERVER is interpolated to "mailhog" since I might set `MAIL_SERVER=mailhog` in .env. However, deployment wouldn't include .env and so docker would get mail.myite.com when building.
[02:18:14] <physikoi> Am i close?
[02:19:28] <physikoi> looking now
[02:19:52] <rawtaz> that would be correct yes, you are talking about making use of the default value for that environment variable
[02:20:25] <rawtaz> i would however not recommend to have a default value like that, as it's better to keep that type of variable as required and not have a default
[02:20:32] <rawtaz> also the syntax for default value is just - not :-
[02:24:20] <physikoi> ah, yeah, i mixed up bash and docker syntax

[02:26:25] <physikoi> In your example posted online, you invoke docker-compose with both docker-compose.override.yaml  and docker-compose.yaml in your development environment. Deployment would then just somehow entail invoking docker-compose with docker-compose.yml only, right?
[02:26:51] *** Joins: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious)
[02:27:06] <rawtaz> if you are running  docker-compose up  in the same dir as those files, it will automatically read them both, no need to specify either of them
[02:27:32] *** Joins: evocatus (~evocatus@213.193.2.105)
[02:29:20] <physikoi> But deployment would need to exclude  docker-compose.override.yaml?
[02:29:43] <devslash> physikoi, not sure if someone recommentded this but you can set env vars in your compose script that can be read from php/node/server side code
[02:30:36] <rawtaz> physikoi: you dont need to version the override file, correct. it has nothing to do with the production, and all you version is what's relevant for production. the fact that you add some additional sugar in your dev env is outside of the production sources

[02:30:50] <BtbN> Does a .dockerignore only work when it's in the top-level source dir?
[02:31:05] <BtbN> or context-dir. i.e. right next to the Dockerfile
[02:31:06] <physikoi> rawtaz: nice. i have a strategy. thank you so much. wow, what a lesson
[02:31:12] <rawtaz> yeah devslash made a good point - these env vars we're talking about here are simple environment variables that are injected into the actual containers. so they are the end target for using them

[16:15:57] <wez> BtbN: Why would ylu want to use docker when LXC is a thing :)
[16:16:03] <wez> BtbN: but people do
[16:16:12] <wez> :P
[16:16:12] <BtbN> Because it solves different problems
[16:16:18] <wez> BtbN: nup
[16:16:35] <BtbN> yup
[16:17:03] <wez> haha
[16:17:05] <BtbN> LXC is closed to a VM, and Docker with its Dockerfiles, layered approach, standardized building and huge library of default images is a whole different beast
[16:25:11] <riv> docker is easier

[16:29:11] *** liefer4 is now known as liefer
[16:29:33] <rawtaz> why is that complicated? if you just make the ownership and permissions match the user in the container, and if you want make a group or similar so that the host user can access them the same way, like you would with any other scenario where you have multiple users needing access to some files, whats the problem?
[16:30:01] <rawtaz> i dont see the need to match user ids on the host and the container, just let the files be the containers' and thats it

[16:32:07] <ikke> but it still runs on the kernel of the host
[16:33:38] <tabakhase> its "complicated" as not only do you suddenly have two /etc/passwd & /etc/group files, but also actually only one kernel that cares about nummerics-only mixed with the whole portiability issue (my needed id is different than yours) and that you have to solve all of this at runtime while also needing the user during build and you have to mesh this all together nicely
[16:34:58] <tabakhase> once you "know whats going on" its pretty straight forward sure, but first time you hit it its lots of ??? ;-)
[16:34:59] <rawtaz> i probalby just dont get it. to me the dirs and files given to the container is the containers. so it can set whichever ownership it wants. on the host i adapt to that.
[16:35:32] <rawtaz> yeah everything docker can be a bit daunting in the beginning and after that as well :-)
[16:35:50] <tabakhase> if you are "lucky to only need volumes" - yea, you prob have to worry a whole lot less about this - but that aint the case for everyone
[16:36:21] <rawtaz> yeah. i never ever use volumes, i always use bind mounts from the host fs
[16:36:59] <BtbN> That's pretty much what a volume is
[16:37:06] <tabakhase> no?
[16:37:22] <BtbN> With a bunch of abstraction on top, but in the end, it's a bind mount
[16:37:27] <tabakhase> no
[16:37:31] <BtbN> yes
[16:38:23] <BtbN> Sits in /var/lib/docker/volumes/yourvolume/_data
[16:38:33] <BtbN> and gets bind mounted into the container
[16:40:46] <wez> hi BtbN 
[16:41:08] <wez> BtbN: LXC isn't closed
[16:41:43] <BtbN> ?
[16:43:03] <BtbN> "closeR to a VM"...
[16:43:32] <tabakhase> BtbN ill stick to "no" there ;-) thats an implementation detail of the "local" driver, but not "what dcoker volumes are"
[16:44:08] <BtbN> "I want to be right so I define it how I like", fine, whatever you say
[16:44:32] <tabakhase> pretty clear that people talking about volumes talk about named volumes - and bind-mounts people talk about -v /some/path:/some/other
[16:45:08] <tabakhase> otherwise youd also need to take long-form volumes (what nowadays can also take a full path) into that and dont get anywhere
[16:45:45] <rawtaz> both of you are right. speaking from a user perspective bind mounts and volumes dont appear to be the same thing, but technically they are the same as BtbN pointed out. its all good, just different definitions or contexts
[16:46:50] <tabakhase> they also act very differently, so you rly cant just throw em in one bucket
[16:48:53] <tabakhase> say, how `docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/bin/ debian echo yay` horifically explodes, while `docker run --rm -it -v named:/bin/ debian echo yay` works just fine

[21:54:10] <rawtaz> uh what
[21:54:22] <rawtaz> what is "the external db IP address"?
[21:54:49] <rawtaz> you want to be able to connect to your host's ip on some port, and end up at some port in the container, i guess?
[21:56:26] <afidegnum> the external db ip address is 192.168.1.100 that's my PC's IP address... i have configured my db to listen to connections from all ip addresses
[21:56:50] *** Joins: riotz (~riotz@user/riotz)
[21:57:27] <afidegnum> but the docker ip address is callable via localhost:3001

[21:59:00] <rawtaz> what is the actual problem you are having/trying to solve?
[21:59:39] <afidegnum> I want the db browser in the container to be able to connect to the DB server on the host. 
[21:59:45] <rawtaz> right
[22:00:07] <rawtaz> cant you just put there the host's IP, 192.168.1.100 ?
[22:00:21] <tabakhase> afidegnum "container -> host" via IP on the docker0 interface on your host (can be looked up as the gatway used inside the container) -- this host.docker.internal is a not supported everywhere (came from docker-for-mac or so and has only been added recently on linux)
[22:00:23] <afidegnum> it didn't work out
[22:01:04] <rawtaz> afidegnum: if it didnt work, what were the symptoms?
[22:01:13] <tabakhase> if that "doesnt work" a) ensure your db is actually also listening on that IP (localhost of the host is impossible to reach!) and b) firewalling. docker0 is kinda just like another LAN
