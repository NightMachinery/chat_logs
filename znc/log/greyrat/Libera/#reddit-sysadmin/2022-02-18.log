[00:02:01] <Hunterkll> nx032: you just use a local domain DA account there
[00:02:08] <Hunterkll> nx032: then setup converts it back to a limited account
[00:02:15] <Hunterkll> can be any DA account
[00:02:21] <Hunterkll> setup's going to switch it to a limited gMSA 
[00:02:31] <nx032> the thing is the account only exists in the azuread but not on premise so i cant target the thing
[00:02:38] <Hunterkll> no....
[00:02:47] <Hunterkll> you use any domain administrator account... on the service
[00:02:49] <Hunterkll> just like it says...
[00:02:52] <Hunterkll> then run through setup....
[00:02:56] <signofzeta> (though you will need a DA account to make changes to the sync in the future... but still, forget about that for now, it's only for authorization)
[00:03:02] <Hunterkll> Assign domain administrator credentials to the AADConnectProvisioningAgent service, as shown in How to troubleshoot agent failed to start.
[00:03:05] <Hunterkll> *to the SERVICE*
[00:03:16] <Hunterkll> not to some bloody account
[00:03:20] <Hunterkll> use any DA rights account for this
[00:03:21] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> Probably means domain amount that will be used as admin
[00:03:27] <Hunterkll> their example uses the default domain administrator account
[00:03:30] <Hunterkll> no
[00:03:32] <Hunterkll> it doesn't
[00:03:35] <Hunterkll> it means any account with DA rights
[00:03:42] <Hunterkll> setup then changes it to a gMSA account that it creates
[00:03:46] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> Cooked
[00:03:50] <Hunterkll> so it's basically a one shot usage here
[00:03:53] <signofzeta> Your DA credentials are only used to add, change, or modify the service -- NOT for day to day operations.
[00:04:24] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: doesn't matter either way, since it converts it to a gMSA
[00:04:28] <Hunterkll> so the DA account used here 
[00:04:30] <Hunterkll> is just one shot usage
[00:04:34] <Hunterkll> never used again (in this context)
[00:04:36] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: correct~

[00:04:56] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: you need to re-authenticate to make changes later on, but not for regular usage.
[00:05:07] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: right, but this isn't authenticating to anything at all
[00:05:12] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: but any DA will work at any point
[00:05:16] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: ah, oops
[00:05:19] <Hunterkll> this is just giving the service enough righst to create its gMSA
[00:05:24] <Hunterkll> and delegate the gMSA appropriate rights
[00:05:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:05:45] <CableNinja> god fucking fuckass piece of shit fuck automated wanna be AI phone systems
[00:05:57] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: because the next part of that guide covers what to do if it fails to put the gMSA in place (missing logon as a service rights scenario)
[00:05:58] <signofzeta> maybe try an Enterprise Admin (if any separate)?
[00:06:03] <Hunterkll> no
[00:06:08] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: Ah, okay, I'll shut up then.
[00:06:12] <Hunterkll> just set the service's account to a DA
[00:06:13] <Hunterkll> lol

[00:06:36] <Hunterkll> which doesn't exist
[00:06:38] <Hunterkll> because it's a service
[00:06:40] <Hunterkll> not an account
[00:06:47] <Hunterkll> it wants you to change the service account to a DA
[00:06:49] *** Joins: llh (~llh@user/llh)
[00:07:00] <Hunterkll> then it flips it to an auto created gMSA
[00:07:46] <Hunterkll> all he has to do is right click the service in servies.msc, go to the account tab, change the account of the ADConnectProvisioningAgent to any local AD DA account, then rerun the setup
[00:07:49] <Hunterkll> simple enough
[00:08:15] <signofzeta> Oh, I see.
[00:09:19] <Hunterkll> the confusion appears to be that nx032 thinks there is an "AADConnectProvisioningAgent" account that requires DA rights
[00:09:25] <Hunterkll> when in reality none of that is the case
[00:09:28] <nx032> that would be great if i could open services.msc
[00:09:37] <Hunterkll> nx032 can just use their own DA account (or the default domain one) etc

[00:22:20] <shakygator> install the agent
[00:23:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:23:56] <nx032> yeah well guess what , thats where the issue lies during install i get the 'Service Microsoft Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent (AADConnectProvisioningAgent) failed to start. Verify...to start system services
[00:23:59] <Hunterkll> why are we installing AD connect on a domain controller anyway
[00:24:13] <nx032> where else should it go?
[00:24:18] <Hunterkll> its own server?
[00:24:25] <nx032> it kinda is
[00:24:41] <signofzeta> Or any other server.  But if you've got, say, Windows SBS or Server Essentials, you might not have a second OSE.
[00:24:42] <Hunterkll> hence why it sets up limited gMSA service and domain sync accounts so that it doesn't need to be on a DC or DA to operate
[00:24:43] <Hunterkll> just set up
[00:24:54] <nx032> its some weird third server they set up as a midpoint between two DCs and the Azure cloud
[00:25:02] <shakygator> are people still running SBS
[00:25:04] <nx032> but its still a domain controller
[00:25:05] <shakygator> didnt it die in 2011

[00:25:08] <Hunterkll> it sholdn' tbe a DC 
[00:25:09] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:25:13] <DrGibby> yes, people are still running SBS
[00:25:17] <signofzeta> OK, since it's on a DC, it's probably going to fail to start.  There are extra steps.
[00:25:20] <nx032> man idk i didnt set this shit up i just need writeback lol
[00:25:24] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: not true
[00:25:27] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: it just works on that
[00:25:29] <signofzeta> Well, they shouldn't be running SBS, since SBS 2011 (Server 2008) ended support last year.
[00:25:30] <shakygator> lets put AD, exchange and SQL on the same box
[00:25:34] <Hunterkll> you should never run anything except domain controller services (except your security agents, etc)
[00:25:46] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: also, installing exchange on a DC is a supported config, even for exchange 2019
[00:25:47] <Hunterkll> :D
[00:25:51] <Hunterkll> and works
[00:25:52] <Hunterkll> out of box
[00:26:01] <Hunterkll> with default domain policy
[00:26:14] <Hunterkll> which doesn't really lock down jack shit except establish some tiny baselines like stock password policy
[00:26:18] <Hunterkll> doesn't lock down URAs, etc
[00:26:32] <signofzeta> Yes, but DC's have the Default Domain Controller Policy on top of that.
[00:26:37] <Hunterkll> uhuh
[00:26:41] <Hunterkll> which also doesn't do much
[00:27:00] <signofzeta> but it can do just enough.  I had clients who needed scan-to-SMB set up, but they had all services on one DC.
[00:27:08] <nx032> ok so half way through the install when it failed and asked to retry is when i was able to find the service

[09:00:30] <catbeard> i started over and optimized the build for a splitter routed bus/mall technique
[09:00:55] <DrGibby> factorio?! 
[09:01:02] <catbeard> pretty similar
[09:01:06] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> dyson sphere program
[09:01:06] <catbeard> dyson sphere program though
[09:01:10] <DrGibby> booooo
[09:01:17] * DrGibby tabs away
[09:01:21] <catbeard> the copy inserter mod though *rub tit*
[09:01:59] <catbeard> now i can build 60 smelters with sorters and filters already set after just building one, and space them apart between each other with -/+
[09:03:15] <catbeard> so the way works is that everything is routed to a multiple lines going horizontally, then a splitter configured to have an output belt at the 2nd level going over the other belts to a north-south assembler line
[09:03:58] <catbeard> and just try not to have the splitters in each other's way, and just go straight up to the side of the assemblers on each side above the bus lines, then stored in an output belt out to a storage box
[09:04:46] <catbeard> magnets and circuit boards of course conveyed and sorted out to matrix lab to crunch blue science, and now partly to matrix research to increase the hash rate of the current upgrade/technology
[09:05:39] <catbeard> current problem is that i need prisms, which requires stone smelted into glass, but the stone vein is on the other side of the assembler lines above the bus/mall
[09:06:29] <catbeard> i got like 3k+ conveyor belts though heh, i didn't start the magnet/circuit board assembly until i got the splitter, to prevent uneeded conveyor belt shpaget

[09:07:31] *** Joins: CoJaBo (~aztec@user/CoJaBo)
[09:09:24] <catbeard> so now i gotta build like 1k belts just to go around, or find another stone vein to route up into the belt system underneath the existing system

[09:10:38] <sd> 04<J​4Y> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[09:10:50] <catbeard> so all the base materials are delivered in the main bus, and only routed to places that need it, it's "load balanced" meaning it will go both ways unless the split path stacks then it will continue forward past the split unless that's stacked too
[09:10:51] <sd> 04<J​4Y> I got into Timberborn recently, almost as painfully consuming...
[09:11:08] <catbeard> my only problem there is i didn't build enough iron ingot smelters to feed into the bus to keep it full with the split
[09:11:15] <sd> 04<J​4Y> >  it will go both ways
[09:11:21] <sd> 04<J​4Y> a bit like cryptics mum ay 😉 😉

[16:57:05] <SirSceptalot> cool, lemme tell my wife. The modifier to "friday" is really interesting PattyCakes 
[16:57:14] <misspwn> onion rings seems like a better way to spend a friyay
[16:57:22] <PattyCakes> sintax fuck no. PattyCakes isn't a fence guy
[16:57:34] <sintax> heh
[16:57:36] <PattyCakes> but yes, I am going to have it finished
[16:58:04] <sintax> sweet
[16:58:47] <PattyCakes> it will all match soonish. My fence guys are stupidly booked, there's a reason the gate took as long as it did
[16:59:02] <PattyCakes> the guy I was paying to help me could only stop by after other jobs lol
[16:59:03] <sintax> i'm sure. 
[16:59:07] <sintax> lol nice
[16:59:34] <PattyCakes> but for an actual fence line? yea fuck that PattyCakes is paying a crew to do that
[17:00:09] <sintax> heh. 
[17:00:12] <sintax> they're not that bad to do. 
[17:00:23] <sintax> do them on the side with my buddy. decks and pergolas too. 
[17:00:30] <PattyCakes> it's not a 1 man job, and it's not a job I can use dumb for
[17:00:34] <PattyCakes> dumb labor for *
[17:01:00] <PattyCakes> you have dumb labor which is normally free and is your buddy
[17:01:08] <PattyCakes> he's not stupid, but he doesn't build fences every day of the week
[17:01:25] <PattyCakes> then you have smart labor, that's generally NOT free unless you're really good buddies
[17:01:52] <misspwn> that stuff is so expensive right now
[17:02:30] <misspwn> we got a couple estimates to finish off the fencing since both neighbors have the fence but ours is not closed in with a gate. it was going to be like 6 grand to close it in the minimal distance
[17:02:30] <PattyCakes> yea sintax, you'd be what I consider smart labor
[17:02:38] <misspwn> just sheer material right now is $$$
[17:02:44] <sintax> :)
[17:02:51] <sintax> first time i've ever been called smart

[18:15:53] <fritzwastaken> oh definitely
[18:15:53] <vinrock> they were popping up everywhere around here for a while but kinda died off when people realized how crazy expensive they are
[18:15:56] <mistiry> plus all the little food carts and stands and stuff
[18:15:57] <vinrock> oh niec
[18:16:47] <fritzwastaken> Food carts/trucks are my favorite things in the world
[18:17:25] <teh_f4ll3n> fritzwastaken, I see you like living dangerously
[18:17:26] <teh_f4ll3n>  :D
[18:17:51] <vinrock> i am all about food trucks and street carts
[18:17:55] <mistiry> best meal i had in europe was the schnitzel at a Paulaner biergarten in germany
[18:17:56] <vinrock> thats the good shit
[18:18:17] <mistiry> vinrock: i tried all sorts of street vendor food when i could. thailand had some good ones.
[18:18:34] <teh_f4ll3n> german schnitzels are the bomb
[18:18:53] <mistiry> i liked it more than the vienerschnitzel i had _in Vienna_
[18:19:19] <teh_f4ll3n> also, german sausages
[18:19:27] <vinrock> dude thailand just legalized weed
[18:19:30] <yuken> what
[18:19:31] <mistiry> yeah i know
[18:19:33] <mistiry> like wtf
[18:19:35] <mistiry> of all places
[18:19:43] <vinrock> im pretty sure im gonna find myself chillin in thailand pretty soon
[18:19:48] <teh_f4ll3n> and apfelstrudel, mistiry 
[18:19:54] <mistiry> i didnt have that teh_f4ll3n 
[18:19:55] <yuken> Next they just gotta legalise tanks.
[18:19:56] <vinrock> i can finally go on an asian food and weed edventure
[18:20:05] <mistiry> vinrock: nice, bangkok was pretty cool
[18:21:35] <mistiry> dont talk about the king, and dont buy any buddah stuff
[18:21:59] <mistiry> and if you see a movie, be prepared to stand up before it and watch some propaganda about how great the king is before the movie starts
[18:22:56] <mistiry> and negotiate with the tuk-tuk drivers. they're gonna want to take you to a shop in town "just to look", because those shops sponsor the tuk-tuk drivers and provide them with stamps for fuel which is $$$ 
[18:23:31] <mistiry> if you're willing to go look around a clothes shop for 5 mins or something, you can get around for pocket change
[18:24:30] <mistiry> cheapest ride we negotiated was 20 baht, which is like...idk 50 cents? took us to a fashion store, boss had 3 shirts custom made (they delivered to our hotel next day), then we found food
[18:24:40] <vinrock> what im probably gona do when i start hittin up the countreis i wana visit is hire a guide for a few days
[18:25:03] <mistiry> nice

[18:25:21] <layer8> vinrock meant: "what im probably gona do when i start hittin up the countreis i wana visit is hire a sex worker for a few days"
[18:25:28] <mistiry> since it was a work trip, we had locals that we worked with so they helped us out with places to go and stuff
[18:25:47] <mistiry> when we went to india, they hired us a driver for our whole trip. which, yeah...definitely recommended LOL.
[18:25:50] <fritzwastaken> I may have to go to India at some point and its gunna be the samething

[18:26:12] <mistiry> im not a huge fan of indian food, but im glad to have gone there
[18:26:22] <fritzwastaken> I loooooooove me some indian food
[18:26:33] <teh_f4ll3n> fritzwastaken, to you like the smell of shit?
[18:26:57] <fritzwastaken> I mean, I hung out with cryptic1's mom for a bit, so I got used to it
[18:27:07] <mistiry> we had a driver they hired for us, he picked us up from airport and took us anywhere we wanted to go
[18:27:20] <mistiry> kinda felt bad for the guy cuz he'd just sit in the car all day waiting for us, if we were like at the office or something
[18:27:22] <fritzwastaken> for 5USD a day
[18:27:37] <mistiry> i think it was like 35 or something
[18:27:45] <mistiry> i didnt set it up or pay for it so idk for sure
[18:28:20] <mistiry> in india, you dont stop at intersections. you just approach them at regular speed, and when you get close you honk. if you honk before someone else, you get to go first. 
[18:28:27] <mistiry> at least thats exactly how it fucking felt. 
[18:28:39] <mistiry> 4 lane road? 7 cars wide at a minimum.
[18:28:42] <teh_f4ll3n> mistiry, quite accurate
[18:29:18] <mistiry> when you stop, waves of scooters and motorcycles come up from all sides, as the squeeze between everyone to get to the front so they can take off
[18:29:22] <teh_f4ll3n> also, designated shitting streets in poor areas
[18:29:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol what
[18:29:33] <AnonymooseReddtr> designated shitting streets?
[18:29:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> no indoor plumbing in the slums?
[18:29:49] <mistiry> i didnt see any of that, but its not like i saw the whole country
[18:30:10] <mistiry> the beach was pretty sad. in USA the beach is a touristy chill spot. not quite that over there.
[18:30:24] <mistiry> and a LOT of stray dogs
[18:30:40] <mistiry> i tried to go to the KFC the first night there, like 10pm and im out walking the streets of india
[18:30:41] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, dogs are everywhere
[18:30:46] <vinrock> you see any loose cattle
[18:31:06] <mistiry> got stopped by some lady trying to sell my shit that wouldnt leave me alone. cop stopped me telling me i couldnt enter the KFC that was RIGHT THERE
[18:31:17] <mistiry> and pointed me to some shady closed-down-looking place 
[18:31:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> wtf
[18:31:30] <DrZak> lol the guy is still at the airport
[18:31:48] <teh_f4ll3n> still streaming, DrZak?
[18:31:52] <DrZak> yep
[18:31:57] <DrZak> i just switched on again
[18:31:59] <Oliber> he said earlier he does upto 11hr streams
[18:32:07] <Oliber> freakn nut
[18:32:11] <mistiry> AnonymooseReddtr: yeah eventually he let me pass, but he was trying to tell me KFC was closed and i could not go that direction and i needed to go to this other place. i argued enough i guess where he let me go into KFC LOL
[18:32:44] <fritzwastaken> Streaming what? SYsadmin work?
[18:32:46] <Oliber> their friend probably owned the other place
[18:33:09] <mistiry> oh no doubt

[18:35:43] <Oliber> it was a bit more interesting earlier, it was: will they land or go around
[18:35:45] <mistiry> was just gonna ask what we were watching
[18:35:49] <teh_f4ll3n> yes, some crazy crawls earlier, fritzwastaken 
[18:36:17] <mistiry> they having a bad storm or something?
[18:36:22] <fritzwastaken> Interesting
[18:36:29] <fritzwastaken> Yea I was reading about the storm in the UK right now
[18:36:36] <Oliber> somewhat, 60-70mph wind gusts
[18:36:38] <fritzwastaken> Apparently the wind is pretty fuckin nuts
[18:36:45] <teh_f4ll3n> yes, mistiry red warning around London
[18:36:48] <mistiry> figured it had to be something, not just like "oh its kinda windy today so im streaming the airport"
[18:36:57] <mistiry> LHR was pretty neat 
[18:37:07] <mistiry> damn they got all sorts of planes queued up to land
[18:37:23] <Oliber> i think this channel streams a lot doing this, but their viewer base is usually 15-20k, they peaked at around 200k earlier
[18:37:30] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Such a silly thing to stream, and yet I'm sitting here watching it.

[18:38:48] <Oliber> https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=4ca7b3 - this RyanAir flight landed at the Scottish London, good ol RyanAir
[18:41:41] <PublicWiFi> gibby survived the storm by using his farts as fuel for heat
[18:41:50] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I had a short flight once from ORD to ATW, normally like a 30-minute flight.  You don't really level out, you just go up and right down.  It was delayed for like 4 hours because of a storm, finally got in the plane and the pilot says "We're going to try and make up some time in the air..."
[18:42:01] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> He never throttled back at all, just full boar the whole trip.
[18:42:07] <PublicWiFi> he subsequently rose the earth's average temp by 0.5C as well

[18:45:07] <vinrock> i used to fly non-stop for business and only once in my life was I on a flight that dropped out of the air
[18:45:12] <vinrock> and it was coming home from vegas
[18:45:37] <vinrock> it felt like we drove off a cliff, hanging in by the deatbelt, everything hit the ceiling
[18:45:47] <vinrock> lasted a good while too while we just fell out of the air

[19:46:15] <mistiry> he never went to the next game which was at a different bar

[19:47:08] <arlion> yeah, im a bitch to play.
[19:47:13] <arlion> fuckin read 3 books so far >.>
[19:47:16] <arlion> fuckin nerd
[19:47:20] <mistiry> yeah im not into it like that for sure lol. just enjoy some light competition with friends and having a good time with some casual cards

[19:47:34] <arlion> yea
[19:47:37] <arlion> totally
[19:47:45] <fritzwastaken> Originally we would order some pizza, smoke some weed, and play a few hours of 20$ buy in poker
[19:47:46] <mistiry> i need to find local people that play. nobody i know right now plays anything.
[19:47:57] <fritzwastaken> then it got into 50$ buy in and more competative
[19:47:59] <mistiry> spades, hearts, rummy, poker...lets go
[19:48:01] <arlion> im just the type of person who finds a passion and then is compelled to LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

[19:50:58] <hello> Happy friday fritzwastaken 
[19:51:01] <fritzwastaken> I had a friend who could juggle, for some reason juggling got that dude so many chicks
[19:51:17] <fritzwastaken> He would get bored at a party and start juggling, all of a sudden every drunk girl in the room was watching him
[19:51:21] <mistiry> cuz he knows where to put his hands even if he's not looking
[19:51:31] <fritzwastaken> right?
[19:51:38] <arlion> thats so true
[19:51:49] <fritzwastaken> He just knew little party tricks and they worked so well
[19:51:59] <fritzwastaken> slight of hand, juggling, magic tricks etc
[19:52:03] <arlion> i juggle balls and clubs. my buddy and i go out and pass juggle and it attracts just people.. to just watch and admire lol
[19:52:08] <mistiry> confidence and a little talent goes a long way

[20:02:01] <arlion> honestly, they are just a little more smooth. So they glide very well on the table.
[20:02:32] <arlion> Those don't look anything special to me? just a fancy box
[20:02:34] <arlion> what am i lookin at
[20:02:37] <mistiry> they are plastic 
[20:02:43] <mistiry> not paper like standard bicycle cards
[20:02:45] <arlion> oooooo
[20:02:53] <arlion> oh yeah, i dont know how those would compare
[20:03:05] <mistiry> thats the closest i own to what you linked, i imagine
[20:03:45] <mistiry> standard bicycle Rider back design and all, but plastic. they're ok but not my favorite
[20:03:53] <arlion> i swear i thought it was a crock of shit when they said "Italian plastic" like get that gucci poker card bullshit out of there
[20:04:23] <mistiry> they lack the air-cushion finish standard bicycle's have, so to me they arent as smooth gliding against themselves, if that makes sense
[20:04:41] <arlion> yeah yeah
[20:04:43] <mistiry> idk im playing with the right now, maybe im wrong
[20:04:53] <arlion> also paper has a certain roughness to them
[20:05:32] <mistiry> yeah. they definitely handle differently
[20:05:41] <arlion> I also wonder if it's because paper would be easier to mark with a nail 
[20:06:11] <arlion> like easier to nick, so easier to mark the cards and cheat
[20:06:37] <arlion> idk, im just thinking outloud
[20:06:39] <mistiry> maybe
[20:06:51] <mistiry> but thats not so much a concern if you're playing at a real table
[20:07:22] <mistiry> maybe in a bar game or something, but at a casino or a league game you'll have a dedicated dealer and house decks, so unless you think the house is cheating its probably ok
[20:07:37] <arlion> other players try to mark cards all the time
[20:07:38] <mistiry> last i knew, which granted was years and years ago, casinos use paper cards for other table games
[20:07:53] <mistiry> yeah but they switch decks and shit too
[20:08:13] <arlion> if you see a marked card, you are "politely obligated" to tell the dealer. if the cards are ripped or torn in anyway.
[20:08:33] <mistiry> well yeah, if you see something you definitely point it out
[20:08:37] <arlion> and then the dealer tells everyone to but their nails
[20:08:40] <arlion> everyone laughs
[20:08:47] <arlion> omg i play too much poker
[20:09:00] <arlion> *cut their nails
[20:09:33] <mistiry> i should pull out the VR headset and play on there again. i had a good time when i was playing that
[20:09:48] <arlion> playing poker in vr?
[20:09:50] <fritzwastaken> I should get a vr headset
[20:09:51] <mistiry> yeah

[20:10:49] <mistiry> sorry :(
[20:11:00] <arlion> oh yeah, pokerstars is huge
[20:11:41] <fritzwastaken> Way to go mistiry, just sending him down the path of destruction
[20:11:55] <mistiry> its fun. you sit at a table and pick up the cards. gotta grab the chips you want to bet, toss in the cards to fold, knock to check, etc.
[20:12:04] <fritzwastaken> Why not tell PublicWiFi that there is a GoldenCorral VR Game?
[20:12:08] <fritzwastaken> Basically doing the same thing
[20:13:19] <mistiry> you can play with your chips while watiing. you can get little things like drinks and smokes and stuff to fuck around with. i was streaming it one night, and there was two people at the table that knew each other IRL, kids. one kept giving his friend a smoke, and i would steal it from him. over and over again. made the kid rage so hard.

[20:48:07] <mistiry> JollyRgrs: what language are you using in your script?
[20:48:14] <DomLS3> JollyRgrs: just use replace to get rid of -500
[20:50:18] <JollyRgrs> mistiry: it's powershell script
[20:50:55] <mistiry> can you use endswith("-500")
[20:51:00] <JollyRgrs> DomLS3: i could prob just filter out only s-1-5-21, store in my variable and then do a where-object not like "*500"
[20:51:11] <JollyRgrs> but i figured it should seem like something regex can do itself
[20:51:40] <mistiry> $string = "S-1-55325435345"; if( ! $string.endswith("-500")) { blah }
[20:53:03] <JollyRgrs> yeah, that's what i'm sayin... i'll prob just end up filtering after i get the user SIDs
[20:53:11] <JollyRgrs> i'd just rather handle it in the regex b/c it'd be cleaner
[20:53:54] <mistiry> maybe i am lazy. but i will always use functions like that if i can, instead of regex. i hate regex lol.

[20:54:58] <mistiry> right. if you're not doing complex validation stuff, there's probably a function to do it easier

[21:08:24] <sd> 13<B​lasteh> there's a mistake in it anyway
[21:08:32] <mistiry> but again...unless it's really needed... just use .endswith() and call it a day :D
[21:08:34] <DrZak> it depends on what is inside the text

[21:20:13] <JollyRgrs> deadline coming up soon
[21:20:24] <JollyRgrs> the orig. author did a check for 7 digits at the end of the SID
[21:20:29] <mistiry> yeah. i can understand wanting to do it regex, but in my experience (which i know, sample set of one) these days i'm seeing/dealing less and less with regex more complex than a basic match or sub
[21:20:32] <JollyRgrs> but in some countries, they are only at 4 digits
[21:20:52] <mistiry> yeah which is another reason regex is a pain, trying to account for lots of 'exceptions'
[21:21:02] <JollyRgrs> yeah... sometimes it is really helpful. other times it is used but not really necessary
[21:21:30] <mistiry> its not quite like the older days, where you needed to target tighter tolerances on ram and cpu time
[21:21:31] <JollyRgrs> i just need a "Starts with" and "ends with" strings, no need to match each set of hyphenated numbers
[21:21:42] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[21:22:05] <JollyRgrs> and this is literally just going through the profile list of the PC... so it ain't exactly a huge/long script to run

[21:26:38] <mistiry> its more like doing config files

[23:40:01] <AdmiralNines> any SQL veterans out there? I have a fairly simple question: https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/svqv1h/join_formatting/
[23:40:07] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:40:54] <int0x1C8> correlated sub-queries?
[23:42:10] <int0x1C8> if there's weird parentheses in complex SQL queries its because of that
[23:42:54] <int0x1C8> if you run the queries side by side and they return the same data, then you can remove the extraneous formatting

[23:43:13] <int0x1C8> if not, then those are there for a reason to force correct order of operation
[23:44:17] <AdmiralNines> hm. so it can make a difference then?
[23:44:20] <int0x1C8> most trivial case of a correlated subquery is something like:
[23:44:25] <technonerd> glassdoor sure makes it impossible to do anything on their website
[23:45:27] *** Joins: Joe-Developer (~Joe-Devel@user/joe-developer)
[23:45:28] <int0x1C8> select * from table1 where col1 in (select col2 from table2 [...])
[23:46:15] <int0x1C8> you are using a subquery in the where conditional to return an array of values for it to match, but obviously the outer query cannot complete until the inner query runs
[23:46:40] <int0x1C8> thus the subquery is correlated to the main query
[23:47:05] <sd> 06<P​hasey> So question for all you bots, a senior admin we have here is in charge of imaging our laptops, we bases the image off of another workstations image. Example; we have a G6 Elitebook that has all our programs, is on domain etc, he took it off domain and then imaged it, he than puts that image on a G7 and then upgrades the drivers for the G7 machine. We just got G8's and he took the image that was made for the G6 and then altered for the G7 and put it
[23:47:14] <sd> 06<P​hasey> doesn't that cause a lot of issues?
[23:47:21] <sd> 06<P​hasey> considering the hardware inside isn't the same?
[23:48:55] <XV8> when you say image, do you mean a clone or are you talking about something like an MDT profile
[23:49:01] <sd> 06<P​hasey> clone
[23:50:02] <XV8> Short answer, yes, it can. How often is the base image per Gen machine updated? 
[23:50:28] <XV8> Like, once, used for 3 years without updates and then create a new one, or update the clone image every month? 
[23:50:48] <sd> 06<P​hasey> Well I mean the base image was from a G6 once we got the G7's we took that image and updated it with G7 drivers and then once we got a G8 we did the same. So really that image has a mix of three different models
[23:50:59] <sd> 06<P​hasey> only updated when we get a new model
[23:51:27] <XV8> I would say as long as the kernel is updated on the OS and it pulls more generic drivers over time, it shouldn't be an issue, but definitely an issue for newer machines with special drivers.
[23:51:46] <sd> 06<P​hasey> being a jr admin I asked him and he said it's perfectly fine but I noticed when I ran HP support assistance it gave me information of a G6 unit we have which I assume was the computer we created the image
[23:52:03] <sd> 06<P​hasey> what would be a better way to go about it?
[23:52:16] <CptLuxx> the normal way?
[23:52:18] <CptLuxx> mdt
[23:52:23] <XV8> You can use something like MDT to build the images. 
[23:52:28] <CptLuxx> or make an image normalize/sysprep it
[23:52:33] <XV8> ^
[23:52:50] <sd> 06<P​hasey> I know of MDT, never used it but seen some tutorials
[23:52:55] <sd> 06<P​hasey> confused on what you said cptluxx
[23:53:14] <sd> 06<P​hasey> like just prep the new unit before putting on domain and sysprep it?
[23:53:30] <CptLuxx> normalize means remove all weird drivers..
[23:53:33] <CptLuxx> sysprep can do that
[23:53:35] <sd> 06<P​hasey> oh
[23:53:39] <sd> 06<P​hasey> i didn't know that
[23:53:42] <CptLuxx> or USE MDT
[23:53:50] <CptLuxx> like everyone else
[23:53:55] <sd> 06<P​hasey> I asked the sr admin about MDT he doesn't know how to use it
[23:53:56] <sd> 06<P​hasey> lol
[23:53:58] <sd> 06<P​hasey> we use clonezilla
[23:54:02] <CptLuxx> gawd
[23:54:13] <sd> 06<P​hasey> I will try and teach myself MDT
[23:54:21] <sd> 06<P​hasey> maybe I can take a go at imaging a unit
[23:54:22] <sd> 06<P​hasey> :p
[23:54:56] <CptLuxx> how big ist that company?
[23:55:04] <sd> 06<P​hasey> I will find some kind of youtube video
[23:55:05] <CptLuxx> and how long is this dude there?
[23:55:16] <sd> 06<P​hasey> we have 80ish employees
[23:55:25] <sd> 06<P​hasey> and about 200 some workstations on our domain

[23:55:47] <CptLuxx> yeah yeah
[23:55:51] <sd> 06<P​hasey> been in IT since 24
[23:55:51] <XV8> At this point MDT + WDS

[23:56:31] <Emet-Selch> that is just one part of puzzle
[23:56:32] <XV8> Image clones don't scale and you will need to mature as an organization and start really looking into automating that. 
[23:56:39] <Emet-Selch> you also need MDT to prepare images
[23:57:05] <sd> 06<P​hasey> Okay okay
[23:57:11] <sd> 06<P​hasey> I will have to self teach myself and watch some videos

[23:57:33] <Emet-Selch> yeah was about to say he is on his way
[23:57:41] <CptLuxx> loser
[23:57:45] <sd> 06<P​hasey> he is stubborn stuck in his ways
[23:57:49] <sd> 06<P​hasey> but watching him image
[23:57:51] <CptLuxx> "oh i dont learn new stuff i retire in a few years"
[23:57:52] <sd> 06<P​hasey> as he's teaching me
[23:57:57] <sd> 06<P​hasey> I felt like this isn't the proper way...
[23:58:03] <Emet-Selch> also when you are setting up WDS to network boot
[23:58:06] <sd> 06<P​hasey> considering the hardware isn't even similar between machines
[23:58:12] <Emet-Selch> remember that you need to put it as DHCP Relay
[23:58:32] <sd> 06<P​hasey> felt like I was learning the lazy way
[23:58:44] <XV8> Image clones are the lazy way out imo. There are so many better technologies that can accomplish this in a fraction of the time it takes to sit and watch paint dry.
