[00:53:40] <linguist> Ohhhh, I really saw it... I thought for a while I was imagining things 
[00:54:46] <linguist> shadoozo: I'm quite curious on how it works... Will the client do the connection instead of the server? 
[00:57:52] <linguist> I'm quite confused to be honest, I indeed read it but my mind cannot grasp it 
[00:58:07] <linguist> I know my question seems disconnected to the text though 
[00:59:14] <linguist> Specifically, where it says "this requires to obtain a password from the IRC network that The Lounge will be connecting to and generally involves a lot of trust from the network you are connecting to"
[01:00:05] <linguist> It's unclear to me what password is the text talking about, and how will the network trust me... 
[01:01:25] <shadoozo> the irc connection is still going through your thelounge server, but with that username/password thelounge can say to the server "hey user x is actually connecting from ip x.x.x.x"
[01:01:51] <shadoozo> and then it'll display as that ip, but to get such a password you'll need to contact the people who run the irc server that you connect to
[01:07:02] *** Joins: alex11 (~alex11@user/alex11)
[01:07:42] <shadoozo> Not sure what exactly you want, if you want to hide your vps ip to the ircd, that's not possible. But if you want to run each user on a different ip you can look into running znc Infront with a bind host to different ips
[01:12:46] <linguist> shadoozo: after k0t0d4m4's question I've been wondering if I could hide my vps from other users connected to the server... I mean, I assume I can trust the ircd for networks like LiberaChat and OFTC
[01:13:45] <linguist> I'm actually running it locally, on a pseudo-server I have at home, I didn't put it no my VPS cause I was really concerned about other users seeing where I am connecting from

[01:18:35] <shadoozo> You could use a vhost?
[01:18:45] <jjg> hi, sorry my ignorance but how i put my localhost:9000 with ssl?
[01:18:55] <jjg> i read the documentation
[01:19:01] <jjg> use apache
[01:19:13] <jjg> Enable the necessary modules a2enmod rewrite, a2enmod proxy, a2enmod proxy_http, and a2enmod proxy_wstunnel.
[01:19:16] <jjg> how i do this?
[01:31:56] <linguist> jjg: what distribution are you using? 
[01:33:42] <linguist> Those instructions are debian-based, apparently, so you won't find such packages on some other distros... For me running on CentOS the necessary modules were just installed with httpd main package 
[01:36:22] <linguist> shadoozo: well, I think I could, but wouldn't it resolve to the IP anyway? 
[01:38:02] <shadoozo> for ircops yeaaah
[01:38:31] <shadoozo> but the only way to hide it from them is by getting such a password, and even if you get those some will still be able to access it :P
[01:40:10] <linguist> Just to make sure I'm undertanding... By vhost you mean an actual DNS host pointing to my server, right? 
[01:40:34] <jjg> linguist: debian 
[01:41:10] <linguist> jjg: okay, if you're running debian I guess (not sure) you just install them with apt 
[01:41:51] <jjg> will try, thank you
[01:46:15] <linguist> Ohhh, sorry, I googled a little more and apparently a2enmod is a tool to enable the modules, I guess you run those commands on shell... I never used debian though, so I'm not sure whether you have to install them via apt first or perhaps a2enmod will install them for you, no idea on that 
[01:46:56] <linguist> But they will easily enable the modules for you apparently
[01:47:56] <shadoozo> that's rdns (reverse dns) - vhost is something you can do through services

[01:51:12] <linguist> shadoozo: yeah, that's what I mean, I do have multiple hosts and multiple services there, but I don't see how it will prevent IRC users from knowing my VPS' ip, as one could just do a whois on me and then resolve the host
[01:52:17] <shadoozo> if you whois me my host should show up as user/shadoozo -- you can't resolve that
[01:53:23] <linguist> shadoozo: so, you mean not an actual host? 
[01:53:36] <linguist> How do you do that?
[01:54:10] <shadoozo>  #libera-cloak
