[00:50:01] <spruit11> oh right
[00:50:17] <arryana> omg, like, totally gag me with a spoon.
[00:50:43] <Nokaji> it is all so monotonous
[00:50:59] <Nokaji> and such poor ability to communicate
[00:51:13] <Nokaji> "I was like ... woah ... know what I mean? basically"
[00:52:02] <Nokaji> soon they will be able to teach 'speaking english' classes, inside five minutes
[00:53:04] * arryana rolls her eyes
[00:53:17] <Nokaji> beyond me how anyone could live every minute of every day like that
[00:53:41] <arryana> there have always been the inarticulate.  overall education has come enormously far for the average human being in the last two hundred years
[00:54:58] <Nokaji> I'm sure most have had the educational opportunities to learn how to speak their mother-tongue
[00:55:36] <Nokaji> the simply choose to ignore it all - just as ppl choose to ignore the letter 't', when speaking
[00:57:00] <Nokaji> to them, they think that saying 'like' every fifth word, impresses their peer group
[00:57:38] <Nokaji> functionally retarded

[00:59:51] <arryana> to me it just looked like an unchained sense of pointless superiority
[01:00:17] <Nokaji> when ppl ask me "what is your point?", I often respond "what is the moral of your tale?"
[01:00:41] <arryana> i'm sure someone cares.  it just isn't me.
[01:00:48] <Nokaji> evidently
[01:01:25] <Nokaji> I often go over ppl's heads  - don't worry about it
[01:02:44] <arryana> you're not over my head.  your nonsense is beneath my notice.

[09:14:11] <audrey> "The power of the people cannot be stopped. freenode is here to stay, no matter what gets thrown at it. It's now, as well, a recognized digital autonomous zone which gives it the unique ability to provide what freenode does best: freedom."

[16:47:58] <arryana> yeah
[16:48:13] <arryana> at least at our age we aren't 'orphaned'
[16:48:32] <arryana> another friend's kid just lost her mom to suicide five days after her 18th birthday

[16:48:48] <luminousnine> Oh man
[16:48:56] <arryana> her stepmom's been raising her, and we all love her to death for it

[16:49:12] <arryana> she's a tough kid, she'll be okay
[16:49:14] <arryana> sorry to hear it

[21:09:07] <CodePoint> but nothing is not anything -- it's nothing.
[21:09:20] <CodePoint> no, nothing is the absence of somthing.
[21:09:30] <CodePoint> well.. .the absence of everything.
[21:10:24] <TechTest> nothing can be anything
[21:10:29] <spruit11> it's all images!
[21:10:38] <CodePoint> no it can't.  Nothing is litterally nothing.
[21:10:41] <Panther> Is nothing the absence of nothing?
[21:10:45] <TechTest> if you go to the doctor's and you have nothing, that's something

[21:45:12] <DPA> If I had a true general AI, a copyable person so to say, then how should I let it become part of the world? Should I leave it entirely up to the AI? Or should I just throw it into the internet? Or should I put it in companies to replace people? Or should I just open source it?
[21:45:12] <DPA> And what do I do when, for example, china, gets ahold of it? A copyable person could be free, a worker, or in the wrong hands, a solider. With it, we could have paradise or we can destroy the world or worse.

[22:15:40] <lalia> arryana: The first utopia/dystopia reading group meeting is on Monday the 28th. They're reading The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas (~4 pages) and the introduction to Utopianism: A Very Short Introduction (~12 pages iirc?). Both texts have been shared on the Discord server they're using for meetings. :)
[22:16:14] <lalia> Evidently they're still planning out the next few readings. I've been told I'll be notifed when they've got something settled.
[22:17:24] <lalia> If anyone else is interested in philosophy reading groups, lemme know. There are quite a number of active projects being run RN, several of which are led by graduate students with substantial experience in the topics.
[22:17:40] <spruit11> neat

[22:22:02] <lalia> It's a nice opportunity to participate in community-based philosophy discourse taken from scheduled readings. The groups have been quite diverse too: everything from Plato to Chomsky as well as a few special groups like the Buddhism readings.
[22:23:06] <lalia> I've run a few real successful groups through Discord now too, my fav being a Greek tragedy project we worked through last year.
[22:26:59] <lalia> Anyhow, If anyone is interested I'll send you a query with an invite. :)

[22:40:41] <lalia> econo: Yeah, arguably the vast majority of the server are folks interested in mainly analytic varieties of philosophical exchange. Several of the active reading groups focus on analytic texts: the bioethics, metaphilosophy, and phil of sci groups chief among them.
[22:43:29] <econo> anything more ontology related? I have guys like Carnap, Kripke, David Lewis in mind
