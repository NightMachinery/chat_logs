[05:05:57] <sney> the module was already in your kernel, this just adds the utilities to manipulate those filesystems. your mount command should work now, but if it doesn't, try a reboot

[05:17:34] <goose> Not as educational as learning to fix it, but I'll probably just reinstall and restore my important stuff from backups
[05:18:54] <sney> debian keeps your previous kernel installed as a backup, so unless you did something really strange and destructive, it should still be available to you from the bootloader
[05:19:26] <goose> I likely only did a dist-upgrade, but I don't see any other kernels available in the grub menu

Security bugs are fixed in stable by backporting the fix to the stable version (ask me about <security backports>). https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable

[15:55:55] <fatal> i also have a question can i just delete all bin files the are 'Possible missing firmware' when updating initramfs?
[15:56:02] <la_mettrie> when giving kernel version for update-initramfs, is it exactly same syntax for linux-next or should stuff like rc6-next-[date] included...
[15:57:12] <fatal> i just pass the option -k all for that, just look it up in the manpage, la_mettrie.
[16:03:06] <la_mettrie> it requires same version syntax as used as the directory name in /lib/modules/[directory] because it uses the parameter to access that directory. but in that case update-grub complains about initramfs image's name (version number does not start with digit)

[16:42:00] <xx> well the $COLUMNS and $LINES are just an indicator of the problem
[16:42:17] <xx> the real problem is that nothing reacts to resizing of the terminal emulator window if connection sharing is enabled
[16:42:18] <jelly> oh, it does.  They match stty -a.

[19:03:08] <Haohmaru> go to wherever you got those packages, see if there are newer ones which run on debian 11

[19:08:32] <marvka> udaba: libappindicator is deprecated in favour of libayatana, which makes it a bit annoying to get software that depends on libappindicator
[19:09:03] <marvka> discord iirc has a flatpak or snap that you could install, does your VPN have any other universal package format? Maybe AppImages? That would sidestep the whole issue

[19:33:47] <somiaj> or better yet check if the file foo/.git/config exists
[19:34:14] <somiaj> so maybe just check if the file .git/config exists inside a dir, and shells have a standard if flag for this
[19:34:31] <Enissay> So, basically I am doing an `ls ./dir/*` then based on some logic, only pulling some of the content. Hence I need to check for both dir exists & has some content else I exit early

[21:45:59] <rendar> if i install netinst, then can i install xfce with Wayland instead of Xorg? if so, how?
[21:46:44] <greycat> Same way you install it with the full DVD-1 installer.  Select it from the menu at the end, if it's a choice.  Otherwise, install whatever packages implement it.
[21:47:10] <greycat> The netinst and the DVD-1 both use the exact same installer.  The only difference is the number of .deb files on the medium vs. the number that you need to download.
[21:47:11] <sney> xfce does not yet have wayland support

[21:49:42] <rendar> sney, i see
[21:49:45] <somiaj> I don't think xfce supports wayland, at least last I heard
[21:50:07] <sney> so regardless of which debian installer you use, you cannot install xfce with wayland. there is a tentative roadmap here, saying it's supposed to be "working acceptably" on xfce 4.18, so that might show up in sid before the bookworm release, maybe? https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/wayland_roadmap
[21:50:14] <rendar> there is some very light WM like xfce which supports Wayland?
[21:50:16] <somiaj> gnome is basically the most practical solution to running wayland. KDE has wayland support, but it was not complete last I heard.
[21:50:41] <rendar> i wish to avoid gnome at all
[21:50:53] <rendar> i hate all of those tools it installs that clobbers the system
[21:50:59] <rendar> i will keep xfce+Xorg
[21:51:02] <sney> yeah, kde's wayland support is... I mean, it works, but every time I test it I'm like "hmm that's ok" and then I go back to xorg
[21:51:13] <rendar> lol
[21:52:45] <rendar> but my question was more general, let me explain better, let's say i have to install a package which in turn needs another package that i can choose, e.g. if i want to install gnome in debian i just do `apt-get install gnome` and it will start downloading all gnome dependencies including Xorg, my question was more about: can i tell `apt-get install gnome` *which* dependencies (if i can choose them) gnome should download? e.g. wayland instead of xorg

[21:53:08] <PMT> rendar: you mean "apt install wayland gnome"?
[21:53:23] <rendar> PMT, i don't know, maybe
[21:53:34] <greycat> Are GNOME and KDE the only current desktop environments that support Wayland?
[21:53:34] <somiaj> in general you cannot pick and choose dependencies. Though desktops often contain smaller meta packages than gnome, so gnome-core, or various things like that
[21:53:55] <somiaj> afiak, yes, there are some window managers to that do to, but I think they are mostly a feature preview and not really used for day to day use.
[21:53:56] <rendar> somiaj, ok
[21:54:05] <greycat> rendar: gnome does not actually depend on xorg
[21:54:17] <rendar> so with "apt install wayland gnome" i still risk that apt installs gnome, wayland AND Xorg too?
[21:54:31] <PMT> somiaj: sure, but in this case, it's not "ignore dependencies", it's "if you have a dependency that multiple things can satisfy, can I pick which one" - at least, that's how I read it.
[21:54:33] <greycat> "risk"
[21:54:35] <rendar> greycat, huh? how so? it can't work without Xorg or Wayland..
[21:54:53] <Khepra> "wayland" is not a package or a piece of software per se  (libwayland notwithstanding)
[21:54:56] <greycat> gnome is an X11 *client*, which does *not* depend on an X11 server, because X11 is a network-based protocol, and your X server could be on a different machine
[21:54:58] <somiaj> rendar: now recommended packages you can pick and choose, though often users will want recommended packges, you can install things with --no-install-recommends, but you may find some features don't work when you do that
[21:55:14] <somiaj> PMT: ahh yea, I dind't think of it in the case of or depends.
[21:55:22] <Khepra> gnome's mutter and kde's kwin are both "wayland compositors"
[21:55:23] <rendar> greycat, but if you install gnome, xfce or whatever WM with apt-get, Xorg gets installed
[21:55:43] <rendar> somiaj, i see thanks
[21:55:45] <sney> ^ yes, one of the worst common reasons people come to #debian is because they disabled recommends and ended up with half of the packages they need missing, because they thought it would be "lightweight"
[21:55:56] <greycat> If you install "Standard" only, and then install gnome separately, you will not have a working desktop environment.  You'll need to install either xorg or wayland as well.
[21:56:09] <greycat> (Or connect to a remote X server.)
[21:56:12] <Khepra> you don't "install wayland"
[21:56:17] <rendar> greycat, i'm starting from a netinst, i told it from the start
[21:56:26] <greycat> THE NETINST IS JUST THE INSTALLER ON A STICK
[21:56:32] <rendar> if i try to install whatever WM, Xorg gets installed

[21:56:39] <rendar> no reason to capslock, thank you.
[21:56:40] <sney> "standard" is one of the menu items in the installer, regardless of which installer you pick
[21:56:53] <sney> try running the installer and actually looking at what it offers, then maybe your questions will make more sense
[21:56:58] <greycat> From the MENU!?  YES!  If you select GNOME from the INSTALLER TASK MENU, you get Wayland.
[21:57:08] <Khepra> GAAAAH
[21:57:10] <greycat> This is DIFFERENT from if you type "apt install gnome".
[21:57:14] <rendar> i'm not using any menu, i'm in bash command line
[21:57:20] <greycat> ...
[21:57:26] <greycat> Then you're just LYING.
[21:57:30] <rendar> huh?

[21:57:50] <rendar> and i'm in the command line
[21:57:55] <rendar> not in the installer anymore
[21:58:01] <sney> ah, so you keep saying "netinstall" even though it's irrelevant
[21:58:01] <rendar> is that so hard to imagine? -_-
[21:58:12] <sney> because you already installed, it makes 0 difference what installer you used
[21:58:17] <rendar> ok

[21:58:33] <rendar> ok, fine
[21:59:11] <somiaj> the only difference between the netinstall image and say a dvd install image, is additional packages (beyond a minimial base system) are downloaded during the install vs installed from the dvd image. Though if you choose to install no additional packages using tasksel at the end of the install, you would get the same end result no matter what installer you used.

[22:00:30] <somiaj> again, netinstall is not why you don't have xorg.
