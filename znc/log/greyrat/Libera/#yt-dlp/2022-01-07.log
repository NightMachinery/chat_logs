[05:18:08] <JackFrost> FWIW, as if by magic it seems yt-dlp is in Ubuntu's focal-backports repo.
[06:24:56] <pabs3> Unit193 does Ubuntu stuff too IIRC, so that isn't surprising :)
[06:26:06] <JackFrost> Somewhat, yeah.  Though until recently it was impossible to get something into backports.  Also at some point I should likely mention I'm Unit 193.
[06:41:28] <pabs3> haha :)
