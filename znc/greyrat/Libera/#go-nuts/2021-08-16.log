[03:08:06] <L1Cafe> yay and fzf are cool but I don't think that anyone below the level of an expert programmer can really contribute much
[03:08:43] <b0nn> L1Cafe: Sure do, my project is middleware that inspects the request's JWT for a bearer token, then does a lookup in a NoSQL cache that has the token as a key to a full JWT

[03:21:21] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[03:21:40] <b0nn> eg. I wanted a CLI RSS reader, found one being promoted on reddit, then discovered its github, and helped out where I could
[03:23:15] <L1Cafe> b0nn: to be honest it seems to me that I’m completely incompetent and I don’t know if it’s my impostor syndrome, but every time I skim through the issues on any GitHub project I like, everything is absolutely outside my reach
[03:23:53] <L1Cafe> or some projects are so big that I’d have to spend multiple weeks learning them, another few weeks learning the codebase, and then and only then can I start contributing
[03:24:14] <L1Cafe> which doesn’t seem like a great use of anyone’s time, including the project owners

[03:24:29] <foobaz> maybe you have unrealistic expectations about how much time and effort it takes to do software development
[03:24:42] <b0nn> meh, everyone starts somewhere
[03:24:44] <j416> L1Cafe: another idea is to start a small project of your own
[03:24:46] <L1Cafe> Possibly
[03:25:14] <L1Cafe> I just see people churning out kernel code like it’s nothing. And having healthy habits even (so no ADHD or anything) and I just lock up
[03:25:23] <b0nn> learning brownfield projects is always a pain on the grounds that you're not informed on /why/ certain decisions are made
[03:25:28] <L1Cafe> I consider myself a systems guy FWIW, not a software engineer
[03:25:54] <foobaz> the way to get better is to write code
[03:26:06] <j416> L1Cafe: don't compare yourself to them; they've probably spent a lot of time doing exactly that, so it's no surprise they appear good at it
[03:26:07] <foobaz> it takes years of practice to get good
[03:26:12] <L1Cafe> j416: with my own projects I find it very difficult to stay motivated if I’m the only owner
[03:26:13] <j416> ^
[03:26:24] <L1Cafe> foobaz: which is why I want to contribute somewhere
[03:26:31] <j416> L1Cafe: I see.
[03:26:47] <b0nn> L1Cafe: If you want another motivator, apply for some jobs, and do their homework ;)
[03:27:10] <L1Cafe> It’s exactly what’s driving me now. I want to apply as SRE to Google
[03:27:21] <L1Cafe> the systems part I have it pretty good. The programming, not so much.
[03:27:37] <L1Cafe> Basic DS and algorithms are okay. Actually writing useful code is another issue.
[03:28:23] <L1Cafe> Like I’m not going to become a software engineer just by writing leetcode. That makes no sense
[03:28:41] <Torr> L1Cafe: Nope
[03:29:04] <foobaz> i started coding when i was young, so my first projects were video games, which i was interested enough in to dedicate the necessary time
[03:29:48] <foobaz> these days video games don't interest me as much, but i still find interesting things to work on, like writing tools to manage my music/movie collection
[03:30:07] <L1Cafe> i really need to tackle this unhealthy habit of comparing myself to others for sure, any pointers btw?
[03:30:30] <L1Cafe> i know it’s bad but I genuinely don’t know where to begin addressing it
[03:30:40] <foobaz> i am a programmer not a psychologist, all i can tell you is if you want to be a coder you need to write code
[03:30:44] <b0nn> Yes, compare yourself to me instead :D
[03:31:06] <L1Cafe> 😂
[03:31:44] <seebs> i am technically a programmer *and* sort of a psychologist
[03:31:45] <L1Cafe> Psychologists aren’t really that useful in my experience anyway
[03:31:50] <seebs> hmph
[03:32:02] <L1Cafe> like I said, that’s just my experience
[03:32:05] <seebs> anyway, so, the practical thing is: once you know it's unhealthy, that's the biggest part.

[03:35:04] <L1Cafe> You may not have noticed, but a kid can have more fun with a stack of unmarked wooden blocks than most MMO players can have with multi-million dollar game software. This is because kids know how to play. You probably don't. You can learn.

[12:34:49] <usr123> b0nn: I'm basically dialing to DB in my main. Now I wan't to share that db connection with other package as well so they don't have to dial to db themselves. I'm avoiding passing db session as a param to all functions because then it's sort of cumbersome, because every other function would need the db. So I want to have the DB as a package local variable or something so that anyone in the package can use the DB.
[12:35:38] <usr123> And yes I see how the name is bad, but for now I just want a way for all functions/methods in the package to have access to the db.

[13:00:45] <usr123> CommunistWolf: Yeah, I mostly have functions now, and I have a few of them, so don't want to send db as a parameter in every one of them. Also I should mention this is a side project for learning and not something I'm doing professionally.
[13:01:44] <CommunistWolf> package-level could be an option then, it can be easier than trying to rearchitect a pile of write-once code
[13:05:50] <usr123> CommunistWolf: Right. So to implement package level does my code snippet work?
[13:06:41] <CommunistWolf> usr123: you could skip the Dependencies struct and just have var DB ...
[13:06:46] <CommunistWolf> up to you
[13:07:32] <bookworm> global variables are bad mkey
[13:07:52] <bookworm> especially exported ones
[13:07:59] <ikke> global state is bad :)
[13:08:00] <bookworm> so var DB is a very, very bad choice
[13:09:08] <CommunistWolf> eh, depends
[13:10:00] <CommunistWolf> or to put it another way, it's not the first thing I'd be trying to de-globalise, from the list of other bits of global state we've got
[13:10:24] <bookworm> nah, doesn't depend, not at all
[13:10:41] <CommunistWolf> well, enjoy your firm certainties
[13:10:49] <bookworm> it's simply a very bad coding practice. Nothing stops your callers from messing with the global DB, you have no idea in what state it is

[15:55:12] <A_Dragon> but I havent needed to look at a keyboard in years for most things
[15:55:37] <A_Dragon> lack of proper touch typing does mean that occasionally all my messages are left shifted one keyboard row

[16:52:51] <mrig> I like using them but sometimes code has to be a specific format for other reasons, and then you can no longer use them as the output becomes to noisy.
[16:55:02] <siXy> mrig: No. See: https://github.com/golang/lint#purpose

[17:05:04] <mrig> b0nn: using a split keyboard is a superb way of breaking the looking at the keys habit, does take quite some doing though.

[17:05:50] <mrig> Combined with enough tilt that you can no longer see the key caps is even better, far more comfortable anyhow.
[17:06:32] <j416> note that golint is deprecated
[17:06:57] <j416> there are alternatives that provide ways to turn off certain checks
[17:07:40] <mrig> I'm not actualy sure which one I;
[17:07:59] <mrig> I'm using, this is in my vim-go configuration
[17:08:02] <j416> different linters will work in different ways; there's no standard.
[17:08:21] <mrig> a local ignore file would be pretty handy sometimes.
[17:08:49] <siXy> yeah, but a lot of people (including, I assume, mrig) are still using it.

[17:10:41] <mrig> but there are a few others in there that relate to linting, I'm not entirely sure what they do without reading the vim script from vim-go
[17:10:51] <j416> not a fan of golangci-lint either tbh; but it's a good effort
[17:11:14] <mrig> generally it is fine but on some things it is a little pedantic.
[17:11:21] <mrig> as is gofmt at times.
[17:11:24] <j416> (the only reason I'm not a fan of it is that it broke builds for me by introducing breaking changes without respecting semver)
[17:11:58] <mrig> there are lines that would be absolutely fine on one line when { something } are used, that gofmt makes into three lines.
[17:12:14] <j416> you should follow gofmt though
[17:12:22] <j416> makes life easier for everyone involved in your project
[17:13:13] <j416> but I'm sure most agree that on some occasions gofmt doesn't produce the most readable result
[17:13:16] <mrig> The only issue I have is when it splits certain lines into 3 and it does not do it for all of them.
[17:13:36] <j416> do you have an example?
[17:13:41] <mrig> I've not managed to work out what its criteria is exactly yet.
[17:13:51] <mrig> sure yes, hang on I'll find one.
[17:14:25] <j416> (I won't be able to tell you why; just curious since you bring it up)
[17:15:17] <mrig> well a typical one would be and if clause that breaks a loop.
[17:15:36] <mrig> if thisBool() { break }
[17:15:42] <j416> that'd be three lines indeed
[17:16:07] <mrig> there are just a few occasions when it is nicer as one line.
[17:16:13] <j416> true.
[17:16:14] <bookworm> if something messes with the control flow, I prefer it on multiple lines
[17:17:05] <mrig> There are instances in Rob Pikes code when he uses this, I was looking for one of those, but gofmt breaks it.
[17:17:24] <mrig> Could be that it was written like that to fit on a slide though.
[17:17:31] <j416> I think ifs are always broken
[17:18:11] <j416> I remember writing this and thinking it'd look neater to have the last ones as single lines. gofmt didn't think so. https://github.com/jsageryd/aoc/blob/e753bb483075/2018/day-16/main.go#L118-L169
[17:18:30] <mrig> when that clause is also within a switch it is nice to keep the line count down.
[17:18:38] <j416> yes; similar.
[17:19:13] <mrig> Yes exactly that kind of 'systematic' list of data code.
[17:19:46] <mrig> I often write new functions rather than nest, to avoid it.

[17:21:42] <j416> I quite like to keep small one-off functions inline; that way I know they are only used from one place
[17:22:34] <mrig> What do you mean by inline here?

[17:30:19] <siXy> It's a shame that go doesn't let you do type Foo func(a,b,c int); ....; ops[addr] = Foo{c=a+b}. It'd make that code a lot less messy.
[17:31:26] <siXy> (by that code, I mean the gh link j416 posted ^)
[17:31:31] <j416> it'd be less text but it'd be difficult to understand where those variables come from
[17:33:08] <j416> perhaps if, like with a slice, if the signature could simply be omitted and instead inferred from the type?
[17:33:41] <j416> map[string]func(a, b, c int){ "foo": { c = a + b } }
[17:33:59] <siXy> Less bad than mine, but probably still a bit too far towards c++ish implicitness, sadly.

[18:54:32] <MrElendig> when you do, you might even want simd instead anyway

[22:53:04] <enkeyz> ty guys
[22:54:06] <enkeyz> another topic: if we get generics, will some of the stdlib function rewritten from taking interface{} type to <T>?
[22:54:10] <enkeyz> what do you think?

[22:54:23] *** Joins: kwilczynski (sid379192@user/kwilczynski)
[22:56:19] <j416> enkeyz: are you thiking of anything in specific?
[22:56:39] <enkeyz> for example fmt.Printf()
[22:56:56] <j416> I don't see how that would benefit from generics. Do you?
[22:56:57] <enkeyz> it takes ...{}interface type as parameter
[22:57:57] <enkeyz> I mean {}interface type means to take any type
[22:58:00] <j416> for things like sorting or other things dealing with lists though for example, I would expect new generic functions.
[22:58:03] <j416> enkeyz: yes.
[22:59:12] <enkeyz> would be nice to get some functions, like filter, map, etc
[22:59:26] <j416> enkeyz: the whole point of fmt.Printf is for it to be able to take any type, so it makes little sense to restrict it to one in particular, wouldn't you agree
[22:59:51] <bpalmer> there are languages that can do things like provide compile-time safe printf functions (some C++ compilers literally hardcode understanding of printf's format notation, for example)
[22:59:53] <foobaz> it's not plausible to implement Printf with generics because it takes an arbitrary number of parameters

[23:00:15] <j416> I don't think list comprehension is on the map, but things that already deal with list might become easier to use with generics
[23:00:18] <bpalmer> Rust's print! shows a mechanism for doing that sort of thing, as well.
[23:00:20] <j416> (and implement for that matter)
[23:00:22] <enkeyz> foobaz: but they can make it like this: ...<T>

[23:00:43] <j416> bpalmer: interesting.
[23:00:54] <enkeyz> you forget the unpacking operator or variadic operator ...
[23:00:55] <foobaz> with Printf, you don't only have an arbitrary type, you have an arbitrary number of arguments
[23:01:05] <enkeyz> ...<T>
[23:01:08] <enkeyz> not <T>
[23:01:22] <foobaz> unpacking and variadic are runtime operations and are therefore not compatible with generics which are done at compile time
[23:01:30] <j416> it's also a slice of variables of potentially _different_ types
[23:01:35] <j416> so ...<T> wouldn't cut it
[23:01:40] <enkeyz> ...<T> variadic number of parameters of any type
[23:01:58] <enkeyz> I get it now
[23:02:00] <enkeyz> ahh
[23:02:04] <j416> T would have to be mapped compile-time to a specific type, would it not
[23:02:09] <enkeyz> parameters can be different types
[23:02:15] <enkeyz> okey

[23:03:35] <bpalmer> j416: the C++ compilers, btw, only work for the common case of a string literal, so they can look at how many % fields are in the format string. Something like  printf(argv[1], argv[2], argv[3])  clearly can't be compile-time safe.
[23:04:01] <j416> bpalmer: so it's a special case optimization to catch bugs early?
