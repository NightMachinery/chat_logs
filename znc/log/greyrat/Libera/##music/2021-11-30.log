[00:07:56] <artao> modules for that game are on sale RN
[00:08:00] <artao> i'll likely buy at least one
[00:08:12] <artao> they're normally 40 to 80 bucks
[00:08:13] <artao> each
[00:08:15] <artao> per plane
[00:08:28] <artao> but they are VERY high quality
[00:08:53] <artao> to the level that you could sit in the real thing and start it up and use almost all its controls
[00:09:02] <artao> except the ones still top secret
[00:09:37] <artao> from cold start. in the hangar
[00:12:27] <artao> tho i would imagine planes have a lock code you have to enter before you can do anything
[00:13:03] <artao> there are a couple "packs" of lower fidelity planes tho
[00:13:06] <artao> which is what i'd get
[00:13:21] <artao> .... tho perhaps the P-38 Lightning as well. Possibly my fave ww2 fighter plane
[00:13:33] <artao> tie with the Hawker Hurricane and P-40 Tigershark
[00:13:44] <artao> the Spitfire is damn fine too

[01:24:21] <artao> .. not that it grows human edible corn ......
[01:24:30] <artao> even the baby corn is gross
[01:24:31] <artao> lol
[01:24:40] <artao> it's known as "field corn"
[01:24:49] <artao> i.e. -- livestock feed
[01:24:59] <artao> tho it MIGHT be usable ground up as corn meal
[01:25:01] <artao> not sure
[01:25:11] <artao> but it's GMO so NOT determined safe for human consumption
[01:25:13] <morlog> https://www.cheeretc.com/image/data/products/cheerleading_mascots-food-PP-28-Z-Corn-No-Bodysuit.jpg
[01:25:27] <artao> ..... not that i'm one of those people who thinks GMO means dangerous to human health
[01:25:39] <morlog> gmo my
[01:25:45] <artao> ...................... i just think it's arrogance. we CAN'T know what WILL happen when it gets out in the wild
[01:25:57] <morlog> it dies
[01:26:03] <Bakunin> yeah im anti GMO for a thousand reasons
[01:26:20] <artao> we THINK we're all expert and on top of genetics, but our knowledge is still young
[01:26:35] <artao> it's like a 20 yr old thinking they understand global politics
[01:26:37] <artao> lol
[01:26:41] <artao> i'm not anti-GMO
[01:26:48] <artao> i'm fine with it in some cases
[01:26:54] <Bakunin> GMO might be ok in a world with no allergies, prions, or capitalism.  Since that'll never happen...
[01:27:05] <artao> there's no human health dangers 
[01:27:07] <artao> BUT
[01:27:15] <Bakunin> oh there definitely are
[01:27:17] <artao> when we start mising bacterial DNA into plant DNA?
[01:27:18] <artao> yeah
[01:27:18] <artao> no
[01:27:21] <artao> STAP
[01:27:28] <artao> neonicitonoids ...
[01:27:40] <artao> there's no proven evidence of health problems due to GMO
[01:27:52] <artao> there's no real reason that would even happen
[01:28:08] <artao> for instance, glyphosate tolerance
[01:28:16] <artao> that has nothing to do with human health
[01:28:42] <morlog> um
[01:28:42] <artao> regardless, it's a BAD thing, cuz it allows greater use of glyphosate which is demonstrably bad for the ecology
[01:28:57] <morlog> that stuff is really toxic to people
[01:29:02] <artao> but that genetic alteration to make it tolerant to glyphosate?
[01:29:08] <artao> really no impact on human health
[01:29:10] <morlog> and doesnt wash off all that great
[01:29:21] <artao> WE digest the ... well ... all the "stuff" in it
[01:29:34] <morlog> you shouldnt push flawed science
[01:29:39] <artao> the resistances and such of the plant itself really have nothing to do with nutrition
[01:29:52] <artao> glyphosate? yeayh. totally toxic to humans
[01:30:05] <morlog> you need to stop 
[01:30:09] <artao> GMO plants don't contain glyphosate. they're made to be resistant to it
[01:30:11] <artao> what?
[01:30:13] <artao> <sigh>
[01:30:14] <morlog> hey man\
[01:30:15] <artao> no, you
[01:30:17] <morlog> cut it out
[01:30:22] <morlog> change the subject
[01:30:25] <morlog> back to musicv
[01:30:33] <morlog> im serious
[01:30:38] <artao> yes. GMO for glyphosate is bad. but not cuz of human health
[01:30:47] <artao> Monsanto is evil, but no real danger to human health

[01:37:20] <artao> also morlog, it's a common dillema of writers: We WANT a very specific word for something, but can only think of its adjectives
[01:37:51] <artao> or description, which is even worse! cuz at least you can use a thesaurus for synonyms
[01:38:15] <artao> which, of course, is what i meant when i typed adjectives in the first place there ... my brain is still working on remembering that word while i'm typing

[02:02:30] <artao> yeah. them's was some crazy times
[02:02:35] <artao> Kent State
[02:02:35] <Bakunin> all the antebellum cities became donuts
[02:02:39] <MusicalDillo> My Dad taught at GWU
[02:02:44] <artao> in what way is DC a donut?
[02:02:49] <MusicalDillo> Yeah Kent State in '70
[02:02:53] <Bakunin> hole in the middle and white all around
[02:02:57] <artao> the DC street layout is straight up Masonic symbols
[02:02:58] <Bakunin> "white flight"
[02:03:03] <artao> ... speaking of ...
[02:03:05] <MusicalDillo> That's what I've heard
[02:03:24] <MusicalDillo> but then there were lots of Masons amongst the Founding fathers
[02:03:28] <artao> DC has the oldest Masonic temple in the country. I visited it
[02:03:30] <artao> a couple times
[02:03:36] <Bakunin> the founding fathers were all masons
[02:03:37] <MusicalDillo> I can believe that
[02:03:39] <MusicalDillo> never been
[02:03:40] <artao> a couple during the day, and once late at night
[02:03:47] <artao> not ALL, but many. yes
[02:04:04] <MusicalDillo> right, not all by any means, but quite a few
[02:04:08] <artao> i actually snuck in and around the bulding and property late at night
[02:04:15] <Bakunin> close enough
[02:04:19] <MusicalDillo> Washington, Jefferson, Franklin
[02:04:33] <MusicalDillo> Adams maybe, I'm not sure
[02:04:35] <artao> there is LITERALLY a 20 ft deep by 10 ft wide concrete pit surrounding it on the non-public-facing sides
[02:04:44] <MusicalDillo> hah
[02:04:47] <MusicalDillo> a moat
[02:04:47] <artao> AND it has a 13-step pyramid on top. as its roof
[02:04:50] <artao> literally
[02:04:57] <Bakunin> indeed
[02:04:59] <artao> well ... i was gonna say moat, but those have water
[02:05:11] <Bakunin> very cool stuff for 17th century powder wig mofos
[02:05:23] <MusicalDillo> so no crocodiles 
[02:05:25] <artao> also -- and this is true of any masonic temple with stairs to the entrance  -- it has .. shit ...24?
[02:05:33] <artao> i forget off the top of my head. i used to be more into that shit
[02:05:36] <artao> but yeah
[02:05:47] <artao> EVERYWHERE were the significant numbers and symbols
[02:06:02] <artao> i studied Golden Dawn and shit for several years in the 90s
[02:06:08] <artao> both grandfathers were masons
[02:06:29] <MusicalDillo> Isn't Golden Dawn a far-right Greek organization?
[02:06:45] <MusicalDillo> kewl
[02:07:04] <artao> there's a group that uses that name that has NOTHING to do with the Mystical Order of the Golden Dawn
[02:07:10] <artao> which is about magick
[02:07:11] <MusicalDillo> ah, OK
[02:07:24] <artao> based on Masonic and Egyptian mysticism
[02:07:45] <artao> well ..... Masonic is partly egyptian based ...
[02:07:49] <artao> BAHGSHS
[02:08:04] <artao> let's say ... "deeper" Masonry
[02:08:11] <MusicalDillo> k
[02:08:17] <artao> Masons only go so far into "magick" ... golden dawn takes it seriously
[02:08:22] <DOMF> artao, you ever read the Illuminatus! trilogy?
[02:08:29] <DOMF> (Or any other RAW)? 
[02:08:31] <artao> many many times
[02:08:38] <DOMF> I figured you probably had :) 
[02:08:43] <artao> it's on the bookshelf right behind me. i know EXACTLY where it is
[02:08:47] <DOMF> same 
[02:08:51] <artao> it took me like 3 times to actually be able to finish it
[02:08:54] <DOMF> multiple copies in fact, cause I like to lend it out
[02:08:57] <artao> i've read most of his other stuff too
[02:09:02] <artao> LOL same
[02:09:05] <DOMF> I liked Schroedinger's Cat even more 
[02:09:10] <artao> "HERE! You GOTTA read this"
[02:09:12] <artao> they never do
[02:09:20] <DOMF> the whole different characters playing different roles shit, I just LOVE that 
[02:09:24] <artao> i've only read that once. don't even really remember it
[02:09:27] <DOMF> straight up Todd Soldontz shit
[02:09:34] <Bakunin> lol abortion about to be illegal in the us... definitely the dumbest timeline
[02:09:42] <artao> i keep TRYING to read Ulysses,but just ....... GODDAMN i can't get more than 100 to 200 pages in
[02:09:46] <artao> FUCK it's boring LOL
[02:10:05] <artao> Bakunin nah. if it happens it'll get reversed again
[02:10:10] <artao> shit's insane RN
[02:10:17] <DOMF> I've never read Ulysses 
[02:10:27] <artao> give it a go
[02:10:36] <artao> no thicker than Illuminatus!
[02:10:37] <DOMF> it's similar to RAW? 
[02:10:38] <artao> lol
[02:10:50] <DOMF> is it not as funny though? 
[02:10:52] <artao> Illuminatus! is pretty much a direct re-write of Ulysses
[02:10:58] <Bakunin> its too bad there's not a channel to talk current events on this network
[02:10:58] <DOMF> That's what I loved about RAW, he just cracks me the hell up
[02:11:02] <artao> see, that's the thing
[02:11:05] <artao> i don't know
[02:11:06] <artao> LOL
[02:11:18] <artao> i mean, humor back then was different. ya know
[02:11:26] <DOMF> yeah, for sure
[02:11:30] <Bakunin> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1bP5zXqvg0
[02:11:32] <artao> ALSO, however ... James Joyce was a prominent Mason. And in the Golden Dawn
[02:11:33] <Janet> ^ Ahmad Jamal - Toulouse - YouTube
[02:11:44] <artao> so Ulysses is apparently STOCK FULL of mystical symbolism
[02:11:56] <Bakunin> friend, the Masons are just men's drunk club
[02:12:00] <artao> as is Illuminatus! ... tho far less subtle there
[02:12:04] <artao> LOLno
[02:12:15] <artao> some are. sure. local masonic clubs and shit
[02:12:19] <artao> they're low level know nothings
[02:12:21] <Bakunin> you know what the highest level is, right?
[02:12:32] <artao> tell me
[02:12:39] <Bakunin> Shriner 
[02:12:42] <artao> nope
[02:12:47] <artao> but also kinda yeah
[02:12:48] <Bakunin> the people in go-carts with the fezes
[02:12:51] <louipc> wtf goin on in this bitch
[02:12:54] <Bakunin> yeah that's 33rd deg
[02:13:03] <Bakunin> lol
[02:13:11] <artao> you see ... there's two main forms of Masons, plus some variants
[02:13:14] <DOMF> I love Ahmad Jamal. Great shit.
[02:13:14] <Bakunin> there's no such thing as mysticism beyond the magic in your own life
[02:13:17] <artao> so there's no "highest level" per se
[02:13:41] <artao> to BE in the Shriners you need to be 32nd degree in Scottish Freemasonry
[02:13:45] <DOMF> <Bakunin> friend, the Masons are just men's drunk club <-- I used to go to a lot of raves held in a Masonic temple
[02:13:46] <artao> .. as were both of my grandfathers
[02:13:48] <Bakunin> DOMF hell yeah that tune features some of the dertiest upright Ive ever heard around 4:40
[02:13:56] <artao> Scottish Rite is the most well know
[02:14:07] <artao> and fuck me! i can't remember the other main one LOL d'oh
[02:14:10] <Bakunin> DOMF I actually sold Fugazi the weed in a KoC hall ;)
[02:14:12] <DOMF> and apparently the masons that ran the place would sometimes try and take the drugged up underage girls into the back room
[02:14:35] <DOMF> some srsly sketchy shit
[02:14:40] <Bakunin> membership has its benefits
[02:14:41] <artao> Bakunin 33rd degree and Shriners are not the same thign
[02:15:01] <artao> <Bakunin> there's no such thing as mysticism beyond the magic in your own life
[02:15:01] <Bakunin> ok, it was in the east coast us
[02:15:08] <artao> fine plattitude but ... no
[02:15:10] <DOMF> wait shriners in gocarts and fezzes... has this convo come BACK FULL CIRCLE TO DEAD KENNEDYS? :D 
[02:15:20] <Bakunin> :D

[02:15:42] <artao> masonry membership is down these days
[02:15:59] <artao> i could become a mason
[02:16:06] <artao> fun story:
[02:16:07] <louipc> they a bunch of lame nerds
[02:17:19] <artao> SO! Seeing how both grandfathers were masons, and I'd been reading RAW along with tons of other such stuff, including the "books of magick" themselves, I went in to the Masonic temple in Madison, WI to talk to them about joining.
[02:17:20] <Bakunin> there was a moment when Masons leveraged the squad to do some evil
[02:17:27] <Bakunin> in the early 1800s iirc
[02:17:38] <artao> SO!
[02:17:43] <Bakunin> after that New England breakaway event, the club dialed it back a lot

[02:19:29] <artao> Took me to the library and was like, "Okay. Why do you REALLY want to join?"
[02:19:31] <artao> BAM
[02:19:55] <artao> i was like, yeah ... the magick. the "Liberte, fraternite, equalite" ..

[02:20:04] <artao> that's the whole idea you know
[02:20:07] <artao> ultimately
[02:20:43] <artao> he was like, "Yeah, okay. I'd sponsor you ... BUT!! ... You're on probation for a couple felonies. Wait till tall that has blown past."
[02:20:56] <artao> ..... that wasn't sudden knowledge on his part. I'd told him that
[02:21:28] <artao> VERY interesting tho, how that dude heard me mention Wilson and was like, "I'll take over from here."
[02:21:51] <artao> and it was Wilson's other books. "The Widow's Son" for instance

[02:48:57] <artao> her DJ was playing the rave. The first spot got busted and everyone was sent to this second spot where we waited for a couple HOURS
[02:49:03] <artao> far less cool spot
[02:49:16] <artao> but still. CHICAGO RAVE with DJ Dmitri
[02:49:47] <artao> so i was alone in this back corner dancing eyes closed, as usual (unless speaker dancing, which I was taking a break from)
[02:50:20] <artao> open my eyes and LO! there she it. just a few feet away. With HULKING body guards behind her. Blocking her and I in that corner

[02:56:04] <artao> pretty much early dubstep dancing

[02:56:42] <DOMF> post some?
[02:56:46] <artao> well, there's MANY things that are post-jungle
[02:56:49] <artao> dubstep for instance
[02:57:00] <louipc> isnt that the same as making up moves
[02:57:00] <artao> "post" in the lteral sense of "after"
[02:57:06] <DOMF> bah, I don't like that asa a descriptor for jungle

[03:07:04] <DOMF> I eat it every day
[03:07:25] <artao> kul
[03:07:38] <artao> i found i needed to use a lot for an affect
[03:07:40] <DOMF> is thc-v actually legal places where regular cannabis isn't?
[03:07:46] <artao> tho that affect was nice
[03:07:52] <artao> well ... technically yes DOMF
[03:08:00] <artao> as is delta-8 and delta-10 THC
[03:08:01] <DOMF> available as products
[03:08:12] <artao> the law specificaly specifies delta-9 THC
[03:08:21] <artao> so yeah. available in a local store
[03:08:24] <artao> \o/ WOOT
[03:08:36] <DOMF> yeah, I knew 8 was for sure cause that's why they sell it everywhere - so people who can't get D9 can get high
[03:08:51] <DOMF> didn't realized THC-V was included in that 
[03:09:01] <DOMF> (just cause the only place I've seen or heard of it is in CA)
[03:10:46] <artao> ah
[03:10:50] <DOMF> but yeah here's some dubstep from 99 (the first part at least, then it goes into some trad jungle)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sWth8mpo0U

[03:15:53] <artao> Few genres NAIL bass like dubstep
[03:16:33] <artao> to PROPERLY listen to dubstep you need a system that can produce lower than 40hz
[03:16:41] <artao> i know i can start hearing mine around 35
[03:16:45] <artao> feeling it around 30
[03:16:59] <artao> can't hear above 4.5k ... but my cats sure can LOL
[03:17:09] <artao> no wait
[03:17:11] <artao> 14.5k
[03:17:13] <artao> YIKES
[03:17:13] <DOMF> LOL
[03:17:15] <artao> 4.5 k
[03:17:16] <DOMF> I was gonna say
[03:17:17] <artao> jesus
[03:17:20] <DOMF> that would be quite some hearing loss
[03:17:24] <artao> no doubt
[03:17:26] <artao> lol
[03:17:27] <DOMF> but then you'd probably call me pedantic
[03:17:37] <artao> well, you ARE a pedant .......

[03:18:41] <artao> FUCK
[03:18:49] <artao> I can hear Harmor
[03:19:03] <artao> one of the main reasons i installed FL Studio 
[03:19:07] <artao> JUST that synth alone
[03:19:11] <artao> not to mention FM8
[03:19:31] <artao> but Harmor? FFS!!
[03:19:38] <artao> SERIOUSLY underrated synth
[03:20:07] <artao> prolly cuz it's not easy to wrap your mind around cuz it uses subtractive, additive, harmonic, and resynthesis all at the same time
[03:20:25] <artao> like .... WOW
