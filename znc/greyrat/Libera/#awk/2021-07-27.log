[17:21:30] <fafner> remind - this is, shall we say, "powerfull and flexible". For my humble tasks of pepping my memory I usually get by using "at", dropping me an email at a specified time.
[17:24:02] <Riviera> seninha: oh, i just wanted to give some feedback about the repo then, but then I saw the "About" string ("UNIX calendar(1) in awk").
[17:24:22] <Riviera> seninha: that what a missing piece to me, i simply did not understand what i am looking at with your repo, because it was only the manpage.
[17:25:02] <Riviera> seninha: i was asking myself questions like 'uhm, is this "the" calendar? or which one is it, and how does it relate to the others?' and felt a bit lost. :)
[17:25:09] <Riviera> but okay, UNIX calendar(1) in awk! :)

[17:51:25] <Patsie> where's the localization! :)
[17:51:36] <Patsie> weeks starting on monday? What will the americans think?
[17:52:17] <Patsie> but seriously, nice!
[17:52:24] <seninha> Patsie: thanks!
[17:52:43] <Patsie> just curious what the srand() is there for
[17:52:47] <Patsie> line 265
[17:53:45] <Patsie> does it take leapseconds into account? :)
[17:54:29] <Patsie> this expresses working date/time quite well -> https://youtu.be/-5wpm-gesOY
[17:55:04] <seninha> oops, that srand was from an earlier version that used qsort with random pivot to sort the lines. I rm'd that
[17:56:07] <Patsie> :D
[17:56:47] <seninha> No leapsecs, that's why I set days to 12:00 (that's also what OpenBSD calendar(1) does). Unless leapseconds accumulate to 12 hours, that won't be a problem.
[17:57:37] <Patsie> I was just joking :)
[17:57:50] <Patsie> Tom Scotts frustrated explanation is brilliant though
[17:57:55] <Patsie> that's where the reference came from
[18:02:12] <seninha> I'll implement floating events such as easter later.
[18:02:20] <seninha> but yeah, dealing with time is a pita
[18:10:40] <seninha> The week starting on monday is because of the strftime() %u which is based on ISO weeks.
[18:11:35] <seninha> Things gets worse in my native language, in which "Monday" translates literally to "second weekday" (and tuesday to "third weekday", etc): https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/segunda-feira
