[00:00:28] <ggreer> https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(06)02058-0/pdf apparently if you're on an EMS helicopter crew, your career risk of death is around 30%. helicopters are stupidly dangerous
[00:00:30] <Robomot> PDF (2 pages; 61 KB) - doi:10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.05.034
[00:01:09] <gwern> holy shit
[00:01:24] <kuudes> how large is suicide risk?
[00:01:37] <ggreer> I don't know. they only calculated the risk of death from helicopter crash
[00:01:41] <kuudes> iirc the doctors there are anesthesiologists who have career long suicide risk around 9%
[00:01:47] <gwern> immediately raises a lot of questions about whether they're a net QALY loss, quite aside from their extortionate bills
[00:01:56] <kuudes> true
[00:02:03] <ggreer> over a 20 year career I assume they save more than a few lives
[00:03:23] <gwern> but mostly old people, in ill-health, and how much of that is attributable to the marginal helicopter crewmember?
[00:03:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disappointing. Helicopters are very cool
[00:03:48] <gwern> (if there are 3 aboard, perhaps there could be 2 instead. or the victim could just be driven)
[00:03:50] <kuudes> why old people?
[00:03:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> But, I guess, that's tied to how dangerous they are...
[00:04:11] <kuudes> don't they usually save people from car crashes and terrain?
[00:04:12] <ggreer> I think the helicopters are used to get people from remote locations (ski resorts, islands, etc)
[00:04:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Aren't they mostly used when driving isn't a feasible option?
[00:04:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which of course is probably part of what makes it dangerous - if you're flying to a remote place with weird terrain, that increases risk...)
[00:04:44] <mst> ggreer: I mostly know of them being used for road traffic accidents
[00:04:47] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: once they are available, they will get used even when driving would've worked. after all, there are all those fixed costs... why be a miser and make them drive when a copter could them there a few minutes faster?
[00:04:53] <ggreer> huh. weird. I guess it depends on where you live
[00:05:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Not sure that's true. Fuel costs are a thing
[00:05:26] <gwern> copters require maintenance, insurance, licensing, standby pilots and crew...
[00:05:34] <ggreer> yeah helicopter cost to operate per hour is probably over $1,000
[00:05:37] <gwern> this is the sort of whizbang thing where no one runs the numbers
[00:05:52] <mst> ggreer: this is based on "stories I've hard from A&E and EMS people" though, and could easily not be a whole-UK distribution
[00:06:00] <gwern> sort of like blood transfusions or back surgeries or ambulances themselves. run RCTs??? what are you, a monster? it *obviously* works.
[00:06:11] <mst> ggreer: though we don't have as much geography as the US anyway
[00:06:15] <kuudes> well, over here indeed many in the business have mentioned it would be more efficient to just have some 4 more ambulances at readiness than a helicopter
[00:06:31] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: welp. I will say this much: moldbug hasn't written much about ruskin before so I can't accuse him of repeating himself for the nth time
[00:06:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[00:07:24] <gwern> (this may well be the first time he's even mentioned Ruskin? I can't recall him coming up at all)
[00:07:34] <adiabatic> new to me
[00:07:47] <kuudes> ambulance can't drive very much faster than 100 km/h safely
[00:08:06] <adiabatic> their superpower is being able to bypass traffic
[00:08:31] <ggreer> helicopters definitely get you there faster than ambulances. there's no traffic, they go in a straight lines, and average speed is over 100mph
[00:08:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is not the first time, but the previous times were in passing
[00:08:47] <kuudes> yes
[00:08:56] <kuudes> helis are at least 3x faster than cars

[00:09:12] <ggreer> if I had to bet, I'd say that helicopters *could* save lives on net, but that we overuse them for shit that isn't life threatening and so they don't in practice
[00:09:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just the most passing mentions

They were also bumbling outsiders, most of whom either couldn’t afford to buy their children’s college admissions without relying on Singer or didn’t seem to know how it was done.
[00:44:20] <feepbot> A frequent charge in the case was Mafia-style racketeering, but unlike savvier racketeers the participants kept writing incriminating things down. A private-equity financier named John Wilson, who was trying to sneak his son into U.S.C. as a water-polo recruit, e-mailed Singer, “What does Jovan need by [S]ept 20? Do u have what we need? Do I make the first payment to u then?”
[00:44:20] <feepbot> One parent sent Singer a picture of his daughter using an ergometer, though she wasn’t a competitive crew-team member. Marci Palatella, the C.E.O. of a California liquor distributor, sent a photo of her son, whom she was trying to get admitted to U.S.C. as a football recruit, posing in his uniform. “Will this work?” she asked. Palatella seemed to suspect that Singer was
[00:44:25] <feepbot> pocketing most of the money. She texted a friend, “I don’t think most of it went to the school between us only. Please never ever repeat anything.” The prosecutors in Boston must have been both perplexed and delighted.

[01:04:15] <ggreer> yeah they're dangerous. a blank will probably kill a person if the barrel is against their skull 
[01:04:28] <gwern> yeah, that's happened. I linked one actor who did that recently

[01:05:03] <saturn2> blanks don't make recoil, real ammo looks more realistic
[01:05:21] <brand0> rumor on the street is the baldwin thing was a setup
[01:05:29] <kiboneu> not really a problem cinematographers are unfamiliar with
[01:05:35] <ggreer> yeah blanks have rather weak recoil
[01:05:41] <kiboneu> i'd probably bet some money on it being a setup

[01:06:24] <kiboneu> gwern: danke
[01:06:39] <gwern> (I was thinking of hexum, not lee)
[01:07:38] <gwern> anyway, my first thought was not 'how did they mix up live and blanks' (because if you ever use any live ammo, it's a matter of when, not if) but 'why was baldwin shooting it at the director and cinematographer instead of a fellow actor'
[01:08:25] *** Joins: Skarn (~skarn@user/skarn)
[01:08:56] <ggreer> IIRC baldwin is anti gun. maybe he doesn't know how to handle them properly
[01:09:14] <ggreer> he's a big movie star. I doubt he listens to the safety lecture by the armorer
[01:09:22] <median> saw that on the news today, felt pretty bad for the guy.
[01:09:38] <median> but yeah, it does beg the question why he had a gun pointed at the cinematographer at close range anyway.
[01:10:39] <gwern> ggreer: he's also super-experienced and no fumbling amateur. I hadn't heard anything about him being unprofessional or disrespectful of safety or reckless... but yeah, I suppose we wouldn't often know
[01:10:42] <ggreer> I've only pointed a gun at another person one time in my life, and that was a stupid accident. (he walked in front of me while I had it pointed downrange)
[01:11:31] <ggreer> the weird thing is that he shot two non-actors. so was he pointing the gun in jest? if so that's super fucked up
[01:11:44] <gwern> richocet was my assumption
[01:11:54] <ggreer> hmm... shooting the water could do that

[01:15:17] <ggreer> it's super weird that two people got hit though. I'm curious what the circumstances are. I could see a freak accident hitting one person, but two? that makes me put my money on aiming directly at them
[01:16:26] <gwern> 'Gun-safety protocol on sets in the United States has improved since then, said Steven Hall, a veteran director of photography in Britain. But he said one of the riskiest positions to be in is behind the camera because that person is in the line of fire in scenes where an actor appears to point a gun at the audience.' aha
[01:17:05] <gwern> I hadn't thought about that, but that explains *both* of them. when you're filming, where's the director *and* cinematographer going to be? right next to the cameraman is a pretty safe bet. heck, perhaps they were overlapping each other even
[01:17:21] <ggreer> that makes the most sense
[01:18:05] <gwern> baldwin is pointing at the audience/camera for a dramatic flourish as he stares down the badguy, pointing his gun straight at the cinematographer anxiously monitoring the camera feed to make sure her angles are _le tilt juste_ as the director stands behind overseeing in general, the trigger is bumped - bam! turns out to be live ammo
[01:19:15] <kuudes> I wonder if they got the film?
[01:19:31] <median> heh
[01:19:35] <gwern> (that's a scenario which makes sense and is consistent with all the reporting thus far, and only requires really 1 error (the ammo))
[01:20:25] <gwern> it could also have been a practice run and some confusion over which prop/ammo to use, and someone fatally grabs the wrong one
[01:20:36] <ggreer> yeah. usually you have to make multiple mistakes to shoot someone. this is the one thing where you're pointing a gun at something you don't want to destroy, and then pulling the trigger
[01:21:28] <gwern> the cameraman is a bit lucky in that scenario: his camera is probably a big heavy metal object with considerable depth, and it's going to be blocking his head and upper chest
[01:21:37] <gwern> the people standing right next to him... not so much
[01:23:42] <kuudes> cameraman died though

[03:58:55] <quanticle> Not necessarily. While what saturn2 says is correct, It's incomplete.
[03:59:02] <quanticle> s/It's/it's/
[03:59:06] <quanticle> I've seen the dark side of that
[03:59:22] <quanticle> Where a company had its own programming language, web framework and application server
[03:59:24] <quanticle> Why?
[03:59:55] <quanticle> Because they had a brilliant programmer (or rather a programmer who'd convinced management that he was brilliant) and he was allowed total technical freedom
[04:00:35] <quanticle> So he implemented this monstrosity in like C++, and I kid you not, I would have *preferred* PHP
[04:01:02] <pompolic> nothing like an ad-hoc, artisanal, locally grown DSL
[04:02:16] <saturn2> good, cheap, fast: you can pick any two, but you get higher status for picking none
[04:02:23] <quanticle> So I would say that's the "charitable" explanation. It's that management is far more afraid of getting stuck with something that only one person understands (and is an absolute trash fire, besides) than they are enticed by the productivity benefits of a small team.
[04:02:50] <quanticle> Like, say what you will about Javascript, but at least it's a known quantity.
[04:04:34] <quanticle> saturn2: Right, but what I'm saying is that having a small team (or a solo developer) doesn't actually help you achieve two of good, cheap, fast. Unless you're technical yourself (in which case, wtf just implement it yourself), you're probably better off hiring in one of the "known" languages and frameworks.
[04:04:56] <quanticle> It's a truism that no one got fired for buying IBM, but does anyone stop and ask themselves why the truism came to be in the first place?
[04:05:51] <saturn2> you're begging the question
[04:07:28] <quanticle> In other words, how is it that e.g. Java came to be one of the "known" languages instead of something else?
[04:07:28] <saturn2> you're taking it for granted that javascript is a known quantity, but that's the very thing i'm trying to explain
[04:07:56] <quanticle> Well, fair enough, I guess.
[04:08:19] <quanticle> Javascript is a bad example in that regard, because of the historical circumstances surrounding its invention and spread.

[06:24:06] <[itchyjunk]> Things with rabies get agressive because the virus transmits via the bites right?
[06:24:21] <[itchyjunk]> the virus is making the animal in question aggressive?
[06:24:45] <quanticle> Yeah, that's how rabies works
[06:24:47] <[itchyjunk]> Would is be bad generalization to assume a lot of viruses can cause behavioral changes?
[06:25:07] <quanticle> Probably? Not all viruses attack the brain like rabies does
[06:26:20] <[itchyjunk]> ah, right. the ones that do make it to the brain are ones i need to look at at some point
[06:27:03] <[itchyjunk]> I don't understand how it can actually cause behavioral changes that's so directed.. i used to assume that it was just degeneration so random irrational behavior
[06:27:17] <[itchyjunk]> But it seems rational .. from the point of view of the virus
[06:27:29] <saturn2> quanticle: imagine a world where, if you have 20 tons of cargo you need to move from one place to another, you have the option to hire a truck with one truck driver, or you can hire 500 guys to carry it there in backpacks. and the normal, tried and true method is the backpacks, because it's too risky to use the truck, the truck driver might not know how to drive properly
[06:31:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... what is this analogy apropos of??
[06:32:12] <saturn2> lisp versus java
[06:32:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh I see
[06:35:49] <gwern> you'd need a backpack factory on hand, though, so that's a lot of capital
[06:38:15] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: the lack of context there is unfortunate
[06:38:29] <saturn2> that works with the analogy - plenty of effort went into the java VM
[06:39:11] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: as for how, who knows? mind-controlling parasites are amazingly precise and powerful, but figuring out how mechanistically they work... I think of it as just like a NN. how does tweaking one parameter do all the things it can do? well, there's a *lot* of them and they all interact in complex nonlinear ways, so you can usually find one
[06:41:45] <saturn2> there are drugs that cause high aggression, the spooky part of rabies is the fear of water
[06:42:07] <adiabatty> so that's why it's called hydrophobia in that one book
[06:43:00] <[itchyjunk]> rabies can infect different hosts so the same "weights" in humans that triggers agression also triggers it in squirrel? 
[06:43:43] <[itchyjunk]> Oh right, forgot about the phobia induced by rabies. how does that fit? is the virus trying to avoid water too?
[06:44:10] <saturn2> it stops the virus from being rinsed out of the mouth
[06:44:20] <[itchyjunk]> heh
[06:45:06] <gwern> (that seems suspiciously just-so)
[06:45:18] <[itchyjunk]> that could be us rationalizing every symptom, no?
[06:46:23] <saturn2> it's an oddly specific symptom
[06:46:49] <quanticle> saturn2: You do realize that analogy makes total sense, right, and describes the real world as it stands?
[06:46:52] <gwern> it is oddly specific, but there are countless weird symptoms. they don't necessarily have any evolutionary purpose
[06:47:26] <quanticle> Where ports are snarled because there's a shortage of truck drivers and there's a shortage of truck drivers because it takes like 6 months to get a class A CDL?
[06:47:28] <saturn2> quanticle: in india?
[06:47:32] <quanticle> No, here
[06:47:32] <gwern> 'it stops it from washing out its mouth' but you could argue that for any kind of respiratory or fluid-conveyed infectious illness like flu or typhoid - 'why let it be washed away or diluted?'
[06:47:42] <saturn2> oh i see
[06:47:44] <[itchyjunk]> Wonder if there are NN viruses yet..
[06:48:32] <gwern> you mean articifial ones?
[06:48:33] <[itchyjunk]> Maybe because flu and friends don't have access to the brain in the same way
[06:48:38] <[itchyjunk]> yes for ANN's

[06:49:01] <gwern> mm. it'd be hard to even define what an ANN virus would be. what do you infect? the weights are fixed
[06:49:01] <quanticle> 5 min video
[06:49:27] <[itchyjunk]> ah, true
[06:49:58] <[itchyjunk]> can't it latch on to the inputs making it be processed differently?
[06:50:09] <[itchyjunk]> i guess that would be more GAN like idea though, not really virus
[06:53:12] <gwern> but then what makes it a virus instead of just part of the data distribution? a GAN will produce pictures of cats because it see a lot of cats, but you wouldn't call cats a virus
[06:54:28] <saturn2> maybe *you* wouldn't
[06:54:51] <quanticle> My mom would
[06:54:56] <quanticle> (She is allergic to cats)
[06:56:04] <[itchyjunk]> If only tiny ANN's could replicate and hide in big ANN's, we'ed have ANN viruses
[06:56:13] <gwern> listen, cats may *carry* viruses and parasites like toxoplasma, but I will deny to my dying day that cats are viruses!
[06:56:15] <[itchyjunk]> sad that it doesn't work out that way
[06:57:55] <gwern> yeah, with fixed weights and no 'NNs training NNs', there's not a lot of space for a 'virus' metaphor to work with. you can definitely imagine a pattern of data which fed into the training dataset 'poisons' the generated samples ('radioactive tracing', I think they call it), but this feels like it falls short of a 'virus'

[07:10:07] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: no, using surrogate models and individual-neuron recording data to optimize perceptual inputs to maximize a specific neuron's firing rate
[07:10:33] <CoJaBo> If you fed it gibberish, it would slowly descend into madness
[07:11:03] <CoJaBo> Then if you switched back to human language, it would persist outputting garbage

[07:18:57] <CoJaBo> It seems like a big leap from that to anything to panic about

[07:28:15] <MrFantastik> yea :/ but i expect that anywhere metropolitan in the usa 
[07:28:38] <quanticle> Really? There aren't that many hobos here, in Minneapolis.
[07:28:56] <MrFantastik> are you talking like specifically hobos?
[07:29:04] <MrFantastik> or homeless people in general?
[07:29:14] <[itchyjunk]> I don't know the difference
[07:29:23] <MrFantastik> hobos travel on trains
[07:29:27] <MrFantastik> leave markings on signs
[07:29:36] <quanticle> Oh, I meant homeless people, then.
[07:29:41] <MrFantastik> homeless do drugs and poop on my porch 
[07:29:53] <[itchyjunk]> Yeah, i meant homeless too
[07:30:10] <[itchyjunk]> discovering subspecies feels like
[07:30:19] <MrFantastik> I lived in Salt Lake City a bit and there was a lot of homeless there too, but not as much poop on the sidewalk or tents
[07:30:20] <quanticle> If you're drawing a distinction, then I think there are more hobos here than in San Francisco, tbh. There's a lot of trains passing through here. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a lot of hobos too.
[07:30:23] <gwern> SF is leaps and bounds beyond anywhere else I've been except berkeley. oxford UK came fairly close for aggressive homeless populations, but NYC, minneapolis, DC, pittsburgh, etc? no no

[09:27:13] * quanticle is looking up _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ on Amazon, and... yep, this is the problem with buying print copies of old books on Amazon: you don't know if you're getting an actual book, or some shitty print-on-demand reproduction where someone downloaded the ePub off Project Gutenberg and turned it back into a physical book.
[09:27:21] <quanticle> Ran into this problem with Mahan's _Sea Power_
[09:27:33] <quanticle> The book was fine... except that it was missing all the maps and figures
[09:27:49] <quanticle> Which, for a book on naval strategy, are... kinda important, lol
[09:28:14] <quanticle> Like, at this point, eBay is literally better for buying books than Amazon

[09:31:17] <PapuaHardyNet> now *that* isn't a scam
[09:31:37] <quanticle> I mean, that only works if the prints are scarce.
[09:32:04] <quanticle> Something like _The Influence of Sea Power Upon History_ was reprinted a bunch of times
[09:34:02] <quanticle> The nice thing about ordering books off eBay is that the sellers are usually like... random used book stores, so they tend to have good material, and the reviews describe the quality of the book as a physical object. Not like Amazon, where it gloms all copies and editions of the book under a single ASIN and the reviews are about the content of the books.

[19:24:47] <RiversHaveWings> I was going to respond with "mimetic desire" but someone already did
[19:29:06] <RiversHaveWings> What the fuck these people are paying $400 for their meme cubes
[19:29:31] <kuudes> what are they and how can I start selling them?
[19:30:18] <RiversHaveWings> The website description is "Tungsten Alloy Cube"? They aren't even 100% tungsten?
[19:31:47] <RiversHaveWings> "1cm Tungsten Alloy Cube- 0.64 oz (18g)"
[19:31:57] <RiversHaveWings> Tungsten's density is 19.3g at room temperature.
[19:32:08] <RiversHaveWings> sorry 19.3g/cm3
[19:34:59] <gwern> iirc, pure tungsten is brittle or something so you want an alloy
[19:35:04] <RiversHaveWings> Ah
[19:36:14] <RiversHaveWings> Yeah it would be hilarious if one of these people dropped their meme cubes and it broke
[19:39:25] <RiversHaveWings> They have a video claiming that it is the "world's heaviest 4" cube"
[19:39:34] <RiversHaveWings> A gold cube would be heavier.
[19:39:50] <kuudes> does anyone make such gold cubes though?
[19:40:03] <RiversHaveWings> A pure tungsten cube would also be heavier but it might shatter on the concrete and that would not sell cubes
[19:40:04] <kuudes> I guess uranium also would be heavier, but there are maybe... problems
[19:40:14] <kuudes> or plutonium
[19:40:26] <kuudes> I mean, for a short while it would be heavier, I guess?
[19:40:53] <RiversHaveWings> kuudes: people use depleted uranium as projectile weapons lol
[19:41:04] <linear> they are almost entirely tungsten, there's a few other metals mixed in to improve form, durability, and so on
[19:41:10] <RiversHaveWings> This may be a bad idea. But it was an actual thing people did.
[19:41:12] <linear> i had bought one a year ago or so, i have.. no clue why
[19:41:16] <linear> so funny to see them turn into memes now
[19:41:48] <linear> gold would probably feel a bit similar, I recall osium being like 12% or so more dense but extremely expensive/difficult, so tungsten is perhaps the best people can get
[19:42:13] <linear> I think in general it falls under a huge desire to experience 'extremes', if you e.g. look at Youtube clickbait you see this as imo one of the most common patterns out of all of them

[21:39:40] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "A tech entrepreneur and pioneering research scientist working at the forefront of natural language processing, Erik Larson takes us on a tour of the landscape of AI to show how far we are from superintelligence, and what it would take to get there. Ever since Alan Turing, AI enthusiasts have equated artificial intelligence with human intelligence. This is a profound mistake. AI works on inductive reasoning, crunching data sets 
[21:39:40] <two2thehead> to predict outcomes. But humans don’t correlate data sets: we make conjectures informed by context and experience. Human intelligence is a web of best guesses, given what we know about the world. We haven’t a clue how to program this kind of intuitive reasoning, known as abduction. Yet it is the heart of common sense. That’s why Alexa can’t understand what you are asking, and why AI can only take us so far.
[21:39:41] <two2thehead> "Larson argues that AI hype is both bad science and bad for science. A culture of invention thrives on exploring unknowns, not overselling existing methods. Inductive AI will continue to improve at narrow tasks, but if we want to make real progress, we will need to start by more fully appreciating the only true intelligence we know–our own."

[21:40:19] <two2thehead>  “If you want to know about AI, read this book. For several reasons―most of all because it shows how a supposedly futuristic reverence for Artificial Intelligence retards progress when it denigrates our most irreplaceable resource for any future progress: our own human intelligence.”―Peter Thiel
[21:40:37] <two2thehead> Isn't Peter Thiel worried about AGI?

[23:53:48] <pompolic> looks like the paper addresses OP's question too
[23:54:03] <pompolic> well
[23:54:07] <pompolic> maybe not, but "A natural-seeming strategy involves simulating the other agent to see what they do when
[23:54:10] <pompolic> given one’s own source code. Unfortunately, this leads to an infinite regress when two such
[23:54:13] <pompolic> agents are pitted against one another"
[23:54:18] <pompolic> this is what the post above was about in my reading
