[00:09:06] <dtrterminus> hi, i have a new kernel update in the pipeline and i was wondering, which is the better way to trigger the install: apt-get update linux-image-4.19.0-18-amd64 vs. apt-get dist-upgrade, i theoreticaly know the difference between them an until now i was using the first method, but today this question came up because i met a guy who use the second variant? so what do you use and why?
[00:10:01] <Khepra> I just use apt upgrade. that rolls both apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade into one.
[00:10:26] <sney> dtrterminus: the former method will mark that versioned kernel as manually installed, which afaik will interfere with letting it be automatically removed later on
[00:10:47] <sney> oh wait, you're passing a package name to upgrade?
[00:11:06] <sney> nvm then
[00:11:16] <Khepra> does that even work
[00:11:35] <Khepra> apt-get _install_ shoud work, but not _update_ and I think not _upgrade_  ... wasn't even paying attention lol
[00:11:48] <sney> yeah I definitely skimmed that and thought it was install
[00:11:54] <dtrterminus> ups sure i mean apt-get install
[00:12:00] <Khepra> apt-get update <package> most certainly won't work
[00:12:06] <sney> ok, then my first response re: manually installed
[00:12:32] <Khepra> just use apt upgrade, shorter to type and it does all you need

[00:14:41] <sney> Khepra: I know you can append install/remove actions to upgrade but I think it requires a - or +, like we had people doing 'apt full-upgrade libgcc1-' to get around the gcc10 transition issues
[00:16:04] <dtrterminus> ok until now i used apt-get install because i thought i avoid possible unwantend version updates from other packages, does it make sense or is that total bullshit and i just should use apt upgrade ?

[00:17:04] <Khepra> dtrterminus: it doesn't make sense. debian packages should be treated as a whole, don't just cherry pick what gets upgrade and what doesn't, unless you really have a reason to hold back an upgrade, in which case use apt-mark
[00:17:19] <sney> if you're using debian stable, you want apt upgrade in order to keep your packages patched. you won't get unwanted version upgrades on stable except in rare circumstances like with firefox-esr.
[00:17:45] <Khepra> for example, I hold back upgrades to zfs if BOTH kernel and ZFS are to be bumped, because due to dkms buggyness, the ordering breaks and zfs isn't really built for the new kernel

[00:19:46] <dtrterminus> ok thanks, i was thinking about things like apache2.2 to 2.4 because of syntax changes which may brake the website
[00:19:56] <somiaj> Yea, this is why debian kernels contain the abi revision in the package name to allow users in such case to know an upgrade is happening.
[00:20:24] <somiaj> dtrterminus: debian tries to avoid version bumps in stable. There unforuntally are some cases where this cannot be avoided due to limited man power
[00:20:44] *** Joins: AquaL1te (~AquaL1te@user/aqual1te)
[00:20:48] <dtrterminus> ah ok that make sense it makes things clearer to me :)
[00:20:52] <somiaj> server side stuff will almost never have this, you can always check what the upgrades are before doing them.
[00:20:53] <dtrterminus> thanks
[00:20:54] <Khepra> dtrterminus: unless there's a huge exception that secteam approved, such changes should never happen in the lifetime of a release, with the notable exceptions like firefox-esr, chromium, and similar
[00:21:24] <Khepra> even the point release bumps of packages aren't as drammatic as bumping apache 22 to 24
[00:23:18] <sney> also make sure you're not using "stable" in sources.list, and getting surprise violent upgrades to the new debian versions when they release. that could produce what you describe.
[00:23:33] <sney> the debian installer doesn't set it up that way but I've seen reports that some vps providers think it's a good idea
[00:24:33] <somiaj> maybe some people like the excitement of everything possibly breaking every two years or so.../s
[00:25:11] <Khepra> well, people run archlinux on servers, so....
[00:25:31] <Khepra> breaking every 2 years doesn't come close to the adrenaline rush fo pacman -syu

[15:04:06] <\\Mr_C\\> nothing shows up
[15:04:59] <Khepra> there are no such modules in regular debian kernels
[15:05:47] <Khepra> and that wiki looks super ancient, listing 2.6 kernel series...
[15:06:18] <\\Mr_C\\> sigh
[15:09:01] <Khepra> \\Mr_C\\: but, the modules ARE in the kernel. you can build custom kernel and enable CONFIG_SCSI_PPA and that other thing
[15:09:16] <\\Mr_C\\> how do i do it?
[15:11:10] <ShorTie> ya, figured for sumfin that old that they wouldn't be built
[15:11:14] <Khepra> \\Mr_C\\: download latest 5.10 from kernel.org. unpack. copy /boot/config/5.10.0-13-amd64  to that_dir/.config; cd into it, run `make oldconfig`; run `make menuconfig`, find the modules with / <type scsi_ppa> and then <scsi_imm>, then enable them, exit, save, yes, `make` and `make bindeb-pkg` and then you have .deb packages for apt install ./path/to/those.
[15:12:09] <Khepra> just note, those are custom kernels and won't be tracked by debian upgrades, nor contain debian patches. so you'll have to regularly repeat the process as 5.10.x keeps updating upstream
[15:12:44] *** alMalsamo is now known as lumberjack123
[15:12:45] <Khepra> alternatively, build the linux kernel from the deb src, alter teh config, but I have zero clue how to do that, when I went looking last time, I was handed a map, a flashlight and spent two weeks in the maze of crappy linux kernel package .debs, and gave up

[16:32:07] <Khepra> uh, mean PPA and IMM  by that *
[16:32:09] <jelly> weird, Debian usually builds drivers for every little thing in their kernels
[16:32:31] <jelly> these would have to have been intentionally disabled at some point
[16:32:40] <raccct> jelly: sry the late reply. it is a VPS so I think a fully virtualized VM
[16:32:48] <Khepra> I reckon with no computer sold having lpt in almost 20 years, they wouldn't bother, and those edge cases can really built custom kernels
[16:33:04] <raccct> My question is: My debian vps reported networking.service failed with RTNETLINK answers: Permission denied. I wasn't sure how to fix it so I did a complete reinstalled of debian from the provider and it seems that the failed networking.service is there from the start. Gernerally the network works but having this failed service in red staring at me feels wrong. what is your opinion?
[16:33:06] <jelly> raccct, can you boot a different kernel?  What does "uname -a" say
[16:33:28] <jelly> raccct, a VPS can be either in a container or in a VM
[16:34:15] * Khepra shudders at that abuse of namespaces as a "VPS"
[16:34:16] <raccct> jelly: Linux myserver.net 5.10.0-12-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.103-1 (2022-03-07) x86_64 GNU/Linux
[16:34:27] <jelly> and if it's a container, then many networking features are limited and that might confuse some of the functions networking.service tries to use at bootup
[16:34:29] <raccct> jelly: can we tell from that?
[16:34:56] <jelly> raccct, that looks like a Debian kernel, so it's probably a full VM
[16:35:47] <Khepra> interstingly, the kernel seems to no longer carry the floppy modules either. when did that happen.
[16:36:11] <jelly> floppy was compiled in since always, no modules
[16:36:38] <raccct> jelly: I see. A full VM is good, right? I would really like to try debian and use it as my main os. But the failed service from the beginning scares me a little, since I want a clean start. Can we fix it?
[16:36:41] <Khepra> jelly: has to be module becuse I was blacklisting it for years because otherwise it threw errors under KVM
[16:37:03] <Khepra> also, there's no longer any option in the menuconfig, <M> or <*> , regardless
[16:38:02] <jelly> raccct, do you have console access?
[16:38:04] <Khepra> hrm.... but modinfo floppy DOES show it
[16:38:27] <jelly> huh
[16:38:31] <raccct> jelly: ssh and vnc, or is that something else?
[16:39:18] <Khepra> aha! found it.   CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD   ffs
[16:39:41] <jelly> raccct, vnc is okay if you can see the grub menu in there, before linux boots
[16:40:02] <Khepra> so the floppy is still regularly installed but zip drivers aren't!   dass raciss!
[16:40:03] <jelly> ssh is remote access to an already booted system

[16:42:44] <jelly> raccct, you might lose network access to the machine doing this, that's why it's important to have console access

[16:43:23] <raccct> jelly: ok, just did a reboot and it runs on Proxmox it seems. I will do your commands now

We suspect you don't, so why don't you back up a bit and tell us about the overall objective... We know that people often falsely diagnose problems because they are too close to them -- it's easy to miss that there is a better way to proceed.  See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
[21:20:32] <drterminus> Khepra: ok more precise
[21:20:37] <Khepra> yes, you can stop forwarding to rsyslog and keep only journald
[21:21:10] <Khepra> your initial question was for specific service, and you mentioned daemon.log (which by default is entire daemon facility), so what _exactly_ you want to achieve?
[21:22:37] <faction> I want to make sure that when my systemd services create lots of logs under load that it won't fill the disk and also not write duplicate logs unnecessarily when using journald is my preference

[21:23:26] <faction> that leaves daemon.log
[21:23:38] <Khepra> disable forwarding to it.  will something break? yes, all the ancient programs that for some reason force rsyslog socket directly.

[23:03:20] <tharkun> Good $DAY I've been having a problem with Firefox for quite some time now. I expected it to be solved when the next security release was isued yet it persists. It just freezes. Specially when an incognito instance is opened. Any suggestion on how to debug the isue?
[23:04:13] <sney> does it eventually unfreeze?
[23:04:25] <sussudio> tharkun: intel video?
[23:04:51] *** Joins: Brottweiler (~brott@user/brottweiler)
[23:05:14] <tharkun> When the incognito is opened it does not. I haven't waited long enough to wait for it to happen. Chrome also freezes some times but it eventually unfreezes.
[23:05:26] <tharkun> sussudio: No, nvidia afaik
[23:05:48] <sussudio> tharkun: disable video acceleration
[23:05:55] <tharkun> sussudio: How?
[23:06:18] <sussudio> you can google this. it's in the browser config.
[23:06:35] <tharkun> sussudio: The browser is the one that freezes ;P
[23:06:43] <tharkun> Hence my stupid question.

[23:08:20] <Khepra> tharkun: but the incognito mode doesn't freeze?
[23:09:41] <tharkun> Khepra: The incognito mode is the one that freezes just by invoking it. When it is normal mode. using google or another search engine just freezes the browser.
[23:10:46] <Khepra> tharkun: about:config, find layers.acceleration.force-enable, set to false.
[23:12:32] <Khepra> tharkun: also in setings, uncheck "Use recommended performance settings" and then uncheck "use hardware acceleration when available"
[23:12:44] <tharkun> Khepra: I foundthe Use recommended performance settings and unselected it. That opended the option to stop using hardware acceleration. That seems to have solved the isue.
[23:13:23] <tharkun> Khepra, sussudio, sney: Thanks for your insight and knowledge. Let alone your time.
