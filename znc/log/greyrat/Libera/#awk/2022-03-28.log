[15:37:05] <xmb> omfg i watched 10s yet very nice
[15:37:14] <xmb> in my bash demo.sh
[15:37:32] <xmb> i cant handle your code mate, thats out of question, neither mod nor understand
[15:37:52] <xmb> but maybe u can add a high res todo, res of miniaturize-fonted rxvt or so
[15:38:00] <xmb> very high res or so
[15:38:34] <Patsie> higher resolution means (a lot) more CPU power and awk is still single threaded
[15:38:51] <Patsie> on my systems, this res with 30fps was pretty much the ideal
[15:39:50] <Patsie> you can easily change demo.awk line 39 and 50 with other width/height resolutions to test in your personal case
[15:39:57] <Patsie> line 39 and 40*
[15:40:24] <Patsie> and if you want faster fps, then: fps=1000 ./demo.sh
[15:40:56] <xmb> k sec
[15:41:09] <xmb> 2827 frames (22.8fps avg)
[15:41:10] <xmb> 135.8MBytes (1.1MB/s)
[15:41:17] <xmb> i didnt watch, nor do i use the amdgpu drivers
[15:42:05] <xmb> fps=60 looks finer,  9165 root      20   0   11300  10252   2380 R  95.0   0.1   0:23.84 mawk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
[15:42:09] <xmb> can it run gawk plz
[15:42:45] <Patsie> awk=gawk ./demo.sh
[15:43:14] <xmb> the metaballs part looks best
[15:43:26] <xmb> the colored background, needs modding
[15:43:33] <xmb> the points there, variable instead of static
[15:43:34] <Patsie> debug=1 awk=gawk fps=60 ./demo.sh
[15:43:45] <xmb> 3891 frames (31.4fps avg)
[15:43:45] <xmb> 153.6MBytes (1.2MB/s)
[15:44:40] <xmb> it says there sometime 60 fps sometimes 20
[15:44:48] <xmb> i disable debug again and wanna see stats then
[15:44:52] <xmb> ill nice it -10
[15:44:57] <Patsie> yes, depending on how CPU intensive the effects are
[15:45:13] <Patsie> again, awk is only single core, so it has to do everything on a single CPU core
[15:45:22] <xmb> you can split the work
[15:45:24] <Patsie> faster CPU is more important in this case than lots of cores
[15:45:41] <xmb> ye, i got halfways, amd 3700u laptop
[15:45:57] <Patsie> I believe the metaballs are the most CPU intensive
[15:46:26] <xmb> can be they look best
[15:46:32] <xmb> i cant check now
[15:47:13] <xmb> a todo: a morph from one object in 1s to another, like the cube to this 16ball
[15:47:33] <xmb> the text u wrote, scrolling, when transparent unreadable
[15:47:49] <xmb> gawk is slow on metaballs
[15:47:57] <xmb> 5 - 10 fps i see
[15:48:16] <xmb> 27.4 fps average
[15:48:44] <Patsie> I should probably remove 4 metaballs and just stick with 4 instead of 8
[15:48:57] <xmb> optimization of the math would do good
[15:48:58] <Patsie> 8 was a bit much
[15:49:08] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[15:49:09] <xmb> in my first try it worked fine
[15:49:14] <xmb> but gawk metaballs were slow
[15:49:18] <xmb> i try now nawk
[15:49:35] <xmb> thats a raytracer ?
[15:49:54] <Patsie> no, it's just a simple hightmap
[15:50:10] <xmb> dunno, .. ..
[15:50:14] <xmb> but the metaballs are insane slow again
[15:50:19] <xmb> may be cause of nice --10
[15:50:42] <xmb> for todo: one metaball alone, no background, etc, with lightening, moving around

[16:27:48] <malina> haven't seen you in ages xmb

[16:28:40] <malina> glad you're around :p anyway, was just saying hi. assuming this was same account. :) hf
[16:28:44] <xmb> yea i wasnt on libera at all it made a bad impression
[16:29:20] <xmb> yea, cool, im wriing on my httpd, and wanted to ask you about base64 or base* math for implenting in awk
[16:30:08] <malina> libera is just the sam eold freenode, the name changed as I suppose that's the only thing left hijacked but this is freenode. and freenode is just lies.

[16:57:18] <Patsie> converting three 8-bit characters into four 6-bit characters and vice-versa

[16:58:24] <xmb> that doesnt tell me what it does, u know
[16:58:36] <xmb> also by converting the chars, why so long code
[16:58:49] <Patsie> it tells you exactly what it does. it's fully documented!
[16:59:23] <Patsie> it's not that long is it? an encode and decode in 80 lines?
[16:59:45] <xmb> the url hex en and decoder are less i think
[17:00:14] <xmb> actually i looked
[17:00:22] <Patsie> well, I made it 'long' because that's usually considered more readable.
[17:00:25] <xmb> after u explained the 3 to 4 line or reverse, much more makes sense
[17:00:34] <xmb> i see only use in runtime
[17:00:39] <xmb> not indenting txt
[17:00:47] <Patsie> I could remove all empty lines, all comments all newlines and make it a oneliner, but that doesn't improve readability
