[02:55:29] <Joanna> I everyone I listened to the 3 part podcast I mentioned yesterday on ww1 it started with a small group of British guys deciding that they wanted to conquer the world. After gaining influence over the british government and news media,Their first target was the Dutch farmers in South Africa .after killing and subjugating those they turned their attentions to the overly prosperous recently unified Germany and set up a naval blockade to 
[02:55:29] <Joanna> force them into a war.
[02:56:03] <Joanna> That is rather difficult than the propaganda taught in school.
[03:25:58] <jan6> *different
[03:27:48] <jan6> also what, were you taught "one evil man got involved in politics, realized how good he was at it, and proceeded to take over half of europe as a dictator, with no provocation from anyone else"
[03:30:05] <Joanna> I recommend listening to the actual podcasts linked  in topic they give more details
[03:30:53] <Joanna> Sorry about the stupid spell checker I don’t know why it changes my words
[03:32:40] <Joanna> Yea one evil man did it all alone with no outside help how did you know ??
[03:44:05] <jan6> because the focus is always on specifically him, and never on "why" or "how"
[03:45:17] <jan6> so much so that even using his name is for some weird reason considered "bad", while arguably WORSE soviets are just fine, because they killed undiscriminatorily
[03:45:30] <Joanna> Yea that’s pretty much standard for any type of criminal big or small.
[03:46:30] <Joanna> He was installed by what We now call a people power revolution
[03:47:33] <Joanna> How did he treat your country?
[03:47:52] <jan6> not much, since we're far enough ;P
[03:49:02] <jan6> russia had their boot up our arse for most of the time, simply cause they didn't need to travel through half of europe to even reach us in the first place, as they were already pretty close
[03:49:44] <jan6> https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/03/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/ is kinda interesting
[03:49:49] <Joanna> What never fails to amaze me is everytime the people behind the scenes decide its time for another war a lot of excited people enthusiastically jump into the meat grinder
[03:49:58] <jan6> duh
[03:50:09] <Joanna> Don’t people read books about history?
[03:50:19] <jan6> "sweet dreams are made of this, who am I to disagree"
[03:50:32] <jan6> "some of them want to use you, some of them want to get used by you"
[03:51:38] <jan6> people are different, there's plenty of people who just want to do what they're told, and/or please their bosses, whoever they are
[03:52:41] <jan6> and there's always quite a few people who hate being told what to do, but actually THINKING about things, is not a thing the majority does
[03:53:02] <jan6> "this sounds bad, we need to get rid of it" without researching IF, and HOW bad it is
[03:53:08] <Joanna> It’s like a bull at a bull fight getting angry because it’s in pain and then being manipulated
[03:53:57] <jan6> like "X amount of people get crushed by heavy contruction equipment" without putting it into scale of how many die of other causes
[03:54:31] <Joanna> Hitler probably benefited non Jews at first by improving their standard of living

[04:08:08] <jan6> well, it's a common stereotype of jews often being rich, and stingy with money
[04:09:08] <Joanna> Their is also a possibility that Stalins paranoia which caused him to turn on his own people could have been caused by western meddling.
[04:09:10] <jan6> I'd assume many people were just annoyed about them, more than it directly helping anything
[04:09:26] <jan6> nah
[04:09:45] <Joanna> It’s not that hard to trick people into hating just about anything including themselves
[04:09:49] <jan6> usa wasn't the sort of ultra-ops nation it is nowdays
[04:10:41] <jan6> and it IS hard to trick people, just not SOME people
[04:11:06] <jan6> although with enough time and persistence and skill, you could probably trick anyone
[04:11:31] <Joanna> Saddam in Iraq couldn’t be removed by the usual tricks so they sent in the military
[04:12:22] <jan6> removed in a suitable timeframe, with suitable budget ;P
[04:12:47] <jan6> it's often much more efficient to just kill the person, instead of spending potentially years trying to play mind games
[04:13:42] <Joanna> I’m sure they tried but his security was too good and he had body doubles
[04:16:31] <Joanna> What I don’t understand is why leaders of countries don’t remove the embassies of people trying to attack them.
[04:17:12] <Joanna> Just cut off diplomatic relations and send all dangerous people home :)
[04:20:54] <Joanna> It’s kind of common sense like not letting people who want to convince your children to kill you into your house.

[17:37:48] <JimBuntu> same question... parsing a list OR are you trying to interact with their email server perhaps and checking brute force combos?
[17:46:43] <Joanna> Hi JimBuntu what’s new ?
[17:47:38] <JimBuntu> hrm. Not much over here Joanna... unless you want a recipe for red enchilada sauce.  How are you?
[17:48:08] <JimBuntu> Ok, I lie, but I don't want to complain about the state of things at the moment.
[17:48:37] <Joanna> I listened to a three part podcast about ww1 yesterday and what an insight
[17:49:02] <Joanna> Red enchiladas sound delicious
[17:51:00] <JimBuntu> enchilada sauce
[17:51:02] <JimBuntu> Roux:
[17:51:04] <JimBuntu> 4 Tablespoon oil
[17:51:06] <JimBuntu> 2 Tablespoon flour
[17:51:08] <JimBuntu> Liquids:
[17:51:10] <JimBuntu> 2 cups broth (1 cup homemade + 1 cup water)
[17:51:12] <JimBuntu> 30 ounces tomato sauce
[17:51:14] <JimBuntu> Seasoning Mix:
[17:51:16] <JimBuntu> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
[17:51:18] <JimBuntu> 2 teaspoon dried oregano
[17:51:19] *** Quits: portalrat_ (~portalrat@user/portalrat) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:51:20] <JimBuntu> 2.5 teaspoon ground cumin
[17:51:22] <JimBuntu> 1/4 teaspoon salt
[17:51:24] <JimBuntu> Pepper Mix:
[17:51:26] <JimBuntu> Dried Ancho, Guajillo, Arbol peppers, a quarter cup of each for a total of 0.75 cups (dried!) (~10g of each)
[17:51:28] <JimBuntu> 14 carlic cloves OR 3.5 teaspoons garlic powder
[17:51:30] <JimBuntu> A cup and a tablespoon of diced onion OR 3.5 teaspoons onion powder
[17:51:32] <JimBuntu> Instructions:
[17:51:34] <JimBuntu> Heat the oil over medium heat
[17:51:36] <JimBuntu> Whisk in flour until browned
[17:51:38] <JimBuntu> Whisk half of broth in until creamy (watch out for explosion)
[17:51:39] *** Joins: portalrat_ (~portalrat@user/portalrat)
[17:51:40] <JimBuntu> Whisk in Seasoning Mix
[17:51:42] <JimBuntu> Whisk in tomato sauce (rinse out can with rest of broth)
[17:51:44] <JimBuntu> Whisk in Pepper Mix
[17:51:46] <JimBuntu> Bring to boil, simmer 15+ minutes
[17:51:48] <JimBuntu> Let cool from lava
[17:51:50] <JimBuntu> Blend until puree
[17:51:52] <JimBuntu> yeah, I should have done that as a link :|
[17:52:11] <Joanna> Since we were discussing China the other day  I thought I’d mention that According to David Icke China is about to take over the world but I don’t know how accurate that info is..
[17:52:28] <Joanna> I really miss cumin spice
[17:52:59] <JimBuntu> China is in a position to take over... but mostly because of their numbers and forceful government.  If they tried though, they might discover how few people REALLY appreciate the gov.
[17:53:57] <Joanna> It’s not just that , a lot of countries have outsourced things there that shouldn’t have been outsourced
[17:54:45] <JimBuntu> Yeah... it's been a long, long time... but once upon a time they even contaminated tons of networking gear just to get some into the US military machine... and it worked, for a short while
[17:55:25] <Joanna> It did make me ponder if their one child policy and population that’s mostly men was part of a master plan
[17:55:53] <JimBuntu> Well, I think that was honestly just about dropping their population, personally
[17:56:18] <Joanna> Or their government is puppets
[17:56:21] <JimBuntu> China was unified long ago thanks to starvation of the then different countries... they have suffered the same many times since then
[17:56:33] *** Quits: elkclone (~elkclone@user/elkclone) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:56:41] <Joanna> Mao was pretty bad
[17:56:49] <Joanna> I’ve heard
[17:57:14] <JimBuntu> If the rest of the people of the world help to feed the people within the Chinese borders, China will likely dissolve.
[17:57:57] <Joanna> But they definitely have a big advantage because countries can’t or won’t make their own stuff anymore.
[17:58:38] <JimBuntu> For sure, the labor thing is a big issue.  Some countries/people prefer super cheap goods at the cost of humans though
[18:00:09] <Joanna> I was listening to the Corbett podcast about how they forced Germany into ww1 by blocking their access to the ocean causing great hardship,and back then people must have been a lot less dependent upon imported things.
[18:01:16] <JimBuntu> Sounds familiar
[18:01:42] <Joanna> Stuff should have never been outsourced in my opinion. Imports should only be for things you can’t make yourself like oranges for Canadians for example
[18:02:28] <Joanna> Same technique as used on Iraq to starve out civilians
[18:02:36] <JimBuntu> Good example for yesterday... but we have great greenhouses now ;p   I know what you mean though, totally
[18:03:09] <Joanna> Imports should be for luxury goods not essentials
[18:03:24] <JimBuntu> Careful what you say though, you'll get labeled as some sort of 'nationalist'
[18:04:20] <Joanna> What’s wrong with not wanting to be dependent to other countries?
[18:04:28] <JimBuntu> Nothing at all
[18:05:14] <Joanna> People have become weak in more ways than one
[18:06:03] <JimBuntu> That seems to fix itself every so often, one way or another
[18:06:35] <Joanna> The government allowed this all to happen
[18:06:56] <JimBuntu> I don't blame the fox for killing a chicken, I blame the farmer
[18:07:07] <Joanna> Of course
[18:08:38] <Joanna> Maybe greed has no bounds and the Chinese offered to make stuff cheap for a good reason but China isn’t the only place
[18:08:52] <JimBuntu> Eventually, we will learn how to deal with rapid communication, and we will end up better for it... until then... look around
[18:09:26] <JimBuntu> Cheap labor is not only China, I agree.  For a modern example that is easily traced check out Palm Oil sales and production.
[18:10:10] <Joanna> I’ve heard that they are doing cyber attack exercises in Europe. And we all know what exercises lead to...
[18:11:04] <Joanna> Palm oil is a disaster. People should produce their own foods locally.
[18:11:09] <JimBuntu> I find the cyber stuff is hard to properly track though... it was a big thing that attacks were comnig from China, but now lots of people use servers in China for that reason.
[18:11:41] <Joanna> Really?
[18:11:47] <JimBuntu> My work related stuff can't even be accessed from IPs known to be located in China, lol
[18:12:33] <JimBuntu> Yes, lots of people now use China IPs for bad things... but that era is about to end due to what I posted above... everyone knows now
[18:12:38] <Joanna> Chinese could use vpns
[18:13:11] <JimBuntu> yup, they could easily use VPN/proxies/etc.  
[18:13:46] <Joanna> What about internet of things.. hacking will only get worse
[18:14:12] <JimBuntu> IoT has been replaced by Internet of Everything (IoE) and it could be terrible. Time will tell.
[18:14:53] <JimBuntu> If you think of every little internet enabled appliance as a soldier... things look different.
[18:15:01] <Joanna> Someday it will all end abruptly and many will die I think
[18:15:49] <Joanna> Why would anyone want internet in their appliance?
[18:16:04] <Joanna> Are they idiots?
[18:17:42] <Joanna> It amazes me how there are people who hate their babies so much that they want to monitor them through the internet rather than being in same room.
[18:18:28] <jessicara> through the internet sounds weird, usually it was over radio these things
[18:18:31] <JimBuntu> People... we are very stupid apes.
[18:18:50] <jessicara> like didn't need to be far away like internet reach, and ill advised to be so
[18:18:55] <JimBuntu> jessicara, baby cams via LAN are quite popular now
[18:20:25] <Joanna> Do they understand that they are torturing their babies who fear abandonment more than anything
[18:20:41] <JimBuntu> Another interesting object are projectors, for light shows... which now have bluetooth for music and internet enabled for digital assistants
[18:21:21] <Joanna> jessicara: I remember those old style monitors would sometimes catch fire and get rid of babies.
[18:21:52] <JimBuntu> I'm really not sure what most/many people think about raising children... remember, we practice full lotus in this household and broke up the duties between each of us.
[18:22:57] <Joanna> I am under impression that most parents want to spend as little time with their kids as possible
[18:23:35] <JimBuntu> I imagine they desire efficiency or something like it and don't think of it as spending less time.
[18:23:49] <Joanna> Regardless all these iot things are a disaster in the making
[18:23:55] <JimBuntu> yup
[18:24:06] <jessicara> think when mum has to work 2 jobs it's not easy
[18:25:13] <Joanna> Mothers should not be having to work two jobs this is how people have been manipulated into turning over their kids to strangers
[18:25:13] <JimBuntu> I wonder what percentage of parents involve a mum working 2 jobs... I also wonder why 2 and not 1 (presuming we are talking about traditional use of 'job')
[18:26:10] <Joanna> The extended family and nuclear family have been destroyed and it didn’t happen by accident
[18:26:52] <jessicara> either cost of living or wages
[18:26:54] <Joanna> People have their kids literally raised by strangers.
[18:26:55] <jessicara> or both
[18:27:50] <jessicara> i don't think destroying the nuclear family is even the problem specifically
[18:27:54] <JimBuntu> Well, I don't mean to sound like some ancient male trope... but I value those people who are capable of assembling humans too much to want them out doing things I can do. At least most of the time
[18:28:06] <Joanna> As I see it a lot of men have been encouraged to be irresponsible kidaults
[18:28:13] <jessicara> now that is true
[18:28:58] <JimBuntu> Geebuz, I think this is the part where I can't help but agree that too many men or more like kidaults
[18:29:10] <Joanna> Women’s lib was a scam to destroy families and make people more dependent upon government
[18:30:30] <JimBuntu> Well... if you raise the cost of living... and you don't want to allow families to grow beyond 1 male and 1 female, you have to let both parties go out and earn income
[18:31:04] <jessicara> pretty much
[18:31:16] <JimBuntu> Yes, it doesn't hve to be male + female, could be male+male or such, but for simplicity
[18:31:21] <jessicara> and then when the father doesn't stay around, that's two jobs for the single parent
[18:31:24] <Joanna> In the old days men who weren’t marriage material probably didn’t reproduce much.
[18:31:32] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[18:33:16] <jessicara> in the old old days there was much larger more organised households and a lot more reproduction in general
[18:33:25] <JimBuntu> Well, I suspect men who weren't marriage material still got their groove on and some amount of time some other more responsible male ended up helping to raise that child, but I hear ya
[18:33:36] <jessicara> yeah it sounds like that
[18:34:00] <Joanna> I’ve never understood why people can’t see past the scam of economics and just focus on making what is necessary. We would be better off without money. How can there be jobless people who can’t work to feed themselves.
[18:34:21] <JimBuntu> Ah, wonderful question... land and education!
[18:34:23] <Joanna> People are disempowered tangled up in bureaucracy
[18:34:31] <jessicara> it makes sense as a broker of limited resources
[18:35:13] <Joanna> In the Great Depression crops rotted in fields while people starved,
[18:35:19] <jessicara> it's not exactly free of the ability to abuse it to take from others though
[18:35:59] <Joanna> It’s nor the resources being lacking it’s misuse of resources
[18:38:40] <Joanna> There is no reason why someone who is able bodied should ever be employed. There is always the job of producing necessities that needs to be done. But we aren’t allowed to do that we are dependent upon other people to pay us money to buy necessities at a profit no less.
[18:39:18] <Joanna> It’s all about centralized control really.
[18:39:25] <jessicara> there can be, also able-minded is another issue
[18:39:34] <jessicara> but yeah it really is mismanaged
[18:40:19] <Joanna> It is all possible because majority of population is completely brainwashed.
[18:41:20] <Joanna> Which has resulted in necessities including food supply being outsourced to foreign countries.
[18:43:08] <Joanna> Also dependency on oil. To conquer the us all that would need to happen is stop the oil tankers for awhile.
[18:44:01] <Joanna> Not a good position to be in but hardly anyone nobody notices.
[18:53:34] <joe7057> JimBuntu keep in mind that making it normalized for both people to be at work automatically puts downward pressure on wages, because it immediately doubles the labour pool available. Were it not for this, there would be no nonsense positions such as "diversity officer" because companies would need all of their personnell budgets to compete for and retain skilled workers.
[18:54:10] <JimBuntu> That's a good point joe7057, which shouldn't be overlooked.  
[18:54:56] <jessicara> that is a position i've often questioned
[18:55:24] <jessicara> it might make sense in a very large organisation, it might need a special job to actually handle the measurements
[18:56:27] <joe7057> jessicara it doesn't make sense in any organization. It is basically created by a bunch of people who get gender studies degrees, then threaten corporations with accusations of racism, sexism, etc.
[18:57:01] <jessicara> seems like it could be a part of general hr
[18:57:05] <joe7057> jessicara then they offer a solution which, surprise surprise, is to hire someone with a gender studies degree at a ceo-level salary to innoculate them
[18:57:14] <jessicara> a lot of it is measurement of change over time to detect issues
[18:57:27] <jessicara> unless they are doing it wrong, i imagine many are
[18:57:59] <joe7057> jessicara honestly the whole HR thing is out of hand as well. The HR department should only be responsible for payroll, not so much of the hand-holding nonsense they do now. It should be very, very rare that they deal with anything else.
[18:58:35] <JimBuntu> I can't wait until we get to have AR depts... Alien Resources ;p
[18:58:38] <joe7057> jessicara they don't do anything except make staff watch material that tells them why they are such terrible people
[18:59:00] <jessicara> that is not what i've seen
[18:59:12] * jessicara has seen better and worse... lol
[19:00:00] <jessicara> like diversity officer teaching kids how to glue rainbow colored glass on their baseball bat, for self defense supposedly
[19:00:19] <jessicara> and then the other side, actual reasonable measurements of change over time to detect if there might be a problem
[19:01:18] <joe7057> jessicara the problem with that sort of measurement is that it assumes that a lack of discrimination will lead to parity, which as we can see form scandanavian countries that have done more than any others to remove discriminatory barriers, is not the case at all
[19:01:28] <jessicara> no
[19:01:41] <jessicara> that is a very simplistic understanding of it
[19:02:07] <jessicara> of course there will remain differences
[19:03:26] <jessicara> like 0.5% of the population won't be represented often in offices of like 5 people
[19:03:43] <joe7057> the problem is that that is usually how it is done, because that is easier than actually taking a deep dive.
[19:04:07] <jessicara> yeah that is true
[19:04:40] <joe7057> Yes, but even in a company of 10000, human nature means that there will not be "equal representation", because people have different interests and skills, and they tend to pursue their interests and skills.
[19:05:10] <Joanna> Not only has women’s lib lowered wages by  making women compete for jobs it has also
[19:05:34] <Joanna> Lead the trend towards monetizing everything
[19:06:42] <joe7057> Joanna honestly what pisses me off the most about it is that it implies somehow that raising children is somehow lower than having a "career job". Nothing could be further from the truth. Raising children is by far the most important job there is, bar none. 
[19:06:43] <Joanna> Housewives used to look after their families and communities without being paid taxable wages.
[19:07:02] <JimBuntu> Mine still do
[19:07:25] <jessicara> yeah it's a very unfair situation
[19:07:49] <Joanna> joe7057: it’s a successful attack on the family most likely for the purpose of population control.
[19:08:16] <joe7057> Joanna of course that is why the government wants them working, so they can tax them. Because despite the claims of "unpaid labour", the reality is that of course they are paid (if you have to put it in those terms) by their husband. Which is why it is still the case that women spend 80%+ of the money, even though the majority of money is earned by men. 
[19:08:36] <JimBuntu> I want so many children, but it would be irresponsible to have them, so we dont.
[19:08:51] <jessicara> yeah seems unethical for me to have kids
[19:09:09] <jessicara> if i get in the situation can support kids, there's a lot who's parents can't
[19:09:46] <JimBuntu> Well, I have some, but not nearly as many as we wanted to have.
[19:10:28] <joe7057> IMO it is more unethical to not have kids. Otherwise you have taken advantage of the society you lived in that has been built for generations, yet you refuse to contribute to the future of that society
[19:10:50] <jessicara> doesn't make sense to me
[19:11:03] <Joanna> The “temporary “ income tax in some places started around ww1 before housewives became taboo. I think there are many reasons to get rid of housewives all of them bad for society.
[19:11:06] <joe7057> I think it is the responsibility of every man and woman in a society to have children who will carry on that society into the future
[19:11:12] <jessicara> there's lots of parents giving up their kids because can't support them
[19:11:47] <JimBuntu> That's pure sadness jessicara 
[19:11:49] <jessicara> makes more sense to adopt and not let the existing ones struggle
[19:12:11] <jessicara> if i had kids i'd surely be adding to the number who cannot be supported
[19:12:11] <Joanna> People who don’t have kids literally become extinct.
[19:12:33] <jessicara> and have doubts i could have kids too, or survive the process
[19:12:38] <joe7057> Adopting children is also a suitable way to carry on the society. 
[19:13:42] <JimBuntu> jessicara, well, although it's anecdotal, I could have wifey come tell a tale of child birthing without pain or serious complication.
[19:14:03] <joe7057> Obviously there are exceptions for cases where it is not actually safe. What I mean is that there seems to be a push nowadays to convince people, especially young women, to not have children even though they are perfectly capable of having them. In my opinion this is hugely immoral, not to mention that we can already see it is setting up these women to live sad, lonely lives.
[19:14:08] <JimBuntu> by pain, I mean proper pain, not hassle... obviously building a baby is a lot of hassle
[19:14:19] <jessicara> yeah not really transferrable to someone else's different situation
[19:14:32] <JimBuntu> yup, purely anecdotal
[19:14:47] <Joanna> A lot of people have been taught not to have kids which really amazes me. If the environment isn’t suitable for kids the best choice is to make it so not give up and become extinct,
[19:16:31] <jessicara> often i think we are not healthy when packed in close together in cities
[19:16:39] <JimBuntu> +1 jessicara 
[19:17:15] <jessicara> i mean humans aren't rats like that experiment, but we have a lot in common with captive wolves and that rat paradise experiment which went wrong
[19:17:23] <JimBuntu> I suppose a thriving civilization requires many kinds of families. I don't mind being one of the ones not in a big city
[19:17:41] <joe7057> jessicara I definitely agree with that. I think people need to move out of cities and into more small towns. In big cities especially it is just a bunch of people with no real connection to the place they live.
[19:17:56] <Joanna> It seems that the powers that be are good at scaring people in all sorts of ways to act against their best interests. It wasn’t that long ago when the average woman had around 14 kids at home .
[19:18:04] <jessicara> 14 kids... 
[19:19:04] <jessicara> think it's very telling that so-called prison-culture seems to be a thing outside of prison, and similar things have been found in captive wolves but not in free wolves
[19:19:11] <joe7057> jessicara I think that the remote work shift will help with that. I do think that it is important that people be physically together when working in a team, but I don't see why a company can't be split into a bunch of offices in different places, rather than all crammed into a single skyscraper. That way you can still work together, but with remote connections to separate teams who you wouldn't
[19:19:13] <joe7057> really meet anyway.
[19:19:34] <Joanna> Indeed. The whole North American continent was filled with white people after they destroyed the Indians.
[19:20:18] <Joanna> People used to get married at age 14 or so
[19:20:51] <JimBuntu> joe7057, I have been a remote worker for basically 10 years now (mostly remote with some in-person activity required)... in general, I really don't see any situation where this can't work.
[19:21:08] <joe7057> well that was still quite a long time ago. But it was certainly common for people to be married at 17 or 18, and start having children.
[19:22:20] <joe7057> JimBuntu certainly true that that is possible. Personally I like to be able to interact in-person with people I am working with directly, but to each their own.
[19:22:44] <JimBuntu> My mother is from a large family like that.  They were travelers, migrant workers. When she became old enough to have children they sold her to a family as a live-in maid.  Although it worked out for her, it's a terrible story in general.
[19:23:15] <Joanna> 14 year olds have been adults for thousands of years until modern propaganda decided otherwise. British used to conscript boys younger than 14 and send them off on war ships
[19:23:19] <joe7057> JimBuntu jeez. There is a reason that we have laws against that sort of thing. 
[19:23:48] <joe7057> Joanna true. Though I believe that the more common age was 16, at least for the romans, where a boy was considered a man.
[19:23:52] <JimBuntu> Well, it wasn't proper slavery by any means. She could have walked away if she really wanted to.
[19:24:35] <joe7057> I doubt that it would have been legal regardless, considering she would have been underage.
[19:24:48] <JimBuntu> Oh, totally not legal, lol, she was 14
[19:25:22] <joe7057> yeah, so as I said, there is a reason we have laws against that sort of thing.
[19:25:41] <Joanna> In some cultures there was child betrothal but they waited until after puberty to consummate the marriage
[19:26:12] <JimBuntu> *was*... still exists, sadly
[19:27:23] <Joanna> Laws making adults into children is just a way to divide us up and take away freedom. It was once possible for a 14 year old to get their own passport.
[19:27:37] <joe7057> indeed. It is a shame that the west no longer has the balls to go to those places and tell them "no, you can't do that. And if you keep doing that, we are going to kill you." Like the British did with the Indian tradition of burning widows on their husband's funeral pyres.
[19:27:53] <Joanna> And go off to a foreign country if they liked without parental permission
[19:28:29] <jessicara> often seems like when we brits went to tell other countries what to do to try to civilise them, we became the barbarians in the process
[19:28:33] <JimBuntu> The issue Joanna, as far as I see it, is that children aren't raised quick enough any more, in general.  14 today is so wildly different from 100 years ago.
[19:28:38] <joe7057> Personally I think that adulthood should be based on something more than just age. Perhaps a requirement to be out of school and gainfully employed for some number of years, to prove that they actually have a stake in the society they are helping to form.
[19:28:48] <Joanna> That’s pretty awful custom and what about the children they lost both parents
[19:29:34] <joe7057> Joanna well as I understand it the idea was to make sure women wouldn't kill their husbands. The British put an and to it by hanging the men who were doing it.
[19:30:06] <Joanna> It’s because of being dumbed down because it’s acceptable to be a kidault now.
[19:30:10] <JimBuntu> Wow, I can think of better ways to make sure a woman doesn't kill her husband... by being a better husband, for example ;p
[19:31:00] <joe7057> jessicara sometimes, but overall it was a force for good. For example, the british empire nearly bankrupted themselves to end slavery around the world. The debts for that were only paid off in something like 2010.
[19:31:08] <Joanna> If the husband dies of old age why should his young wife be killed.
[19:31:24] <JimBuntu> but they didn't end slavery, they only ended the slavery they created
[19:31:35] <joe7057> Joanna exactly. Why do you think the british put a stop to it?
[19:31:36] <JimBuntu> ok, not 'created' but were a driving force in
[19:31:57] <jessicara> a lot of talk about slavery being bad while owning slaves
[19:32:23] <Joanna> The british probably put a stop to a lot of things that didn’t agree with their culture:)
[19:32:37] <joe7057> JimBuntu they neither created not were a driving force behind it. The driving force was the demand for slaves in Africa, the middle east, etc. There is a reason that the British had to go to war to stop slavery, even after outlawing it throughout the empire.
[19:33:34] <Joanna> Slavery did not go away at all it is now called income tax and prison labor.
[19:34:00] <JimBuntu> Britain was an absolute driving force for continued slavery right up until they decided they couldn't continue with it any more... even then, they wrote against it on paper and continued it for quite a while in their colonies.
[19:34:16] <joe7057> Joanna what I mean is chattel slavery. And yeah income tax is its own problem, but not the same thing as slavery.
[19:34:36] <JimBuntu> yeah, I also mean chattle/human slavery explicitly
[19:34:41] <jessicara> britain really did contribute to it a lot
[19:34:49] <jessicara> both the slavery and the anti-slavery
[19:35:12] <Joanna> It’s getting closer and close to chattel slavery all the time. The government has replaced the slave owner.
[19:35:15] <joe7057> JimBuntu yes it did take a while, but the point is that they did it. Remember that before the British abolished it, slavery was completely normal. You cannot expect people who come from the past where it was normal to quickly decide to change that.
[19:35:41] <joe7057> Joanna I don't like income tax either. And yes in some places it is getting worse.
[19:35:55] <jessicara> income tax was really high during wars
[19:35:56] <JimBuntu> Well, like most things, the acceptance of slavery came and went. I think our first records of it being aboloshed was over 2000 years ago
[19:36:12] <Joanna> The british had African slaves working in mines in South Africa didn’t they ?
[19:36:33] <jessicara> yeah
[19:36:47] <jessicara> while it was abolished in britain, it was not in the colonies for some time
[19:37:06] <jessicara> kinda lead to anti-slavery by mouth people owning slaves overseas it seems
[19:37:50] <Joanna> Income tax is bad but conscription is even worse they can literally demand that you or a man in your family go get killed in a war.
[19:37:57] <joe7057> Joanna jessicara yes, as I said, it takes time because slavery was simply a part of life for a very, very long time. And it was the King of britain who abolished slavery throughout the empire.
[19:38:05] <JimBuntu> To be clear, I see any form of Royalty as being pro-slavery.  Serfs WERE slaves. They were owned by their lords. So when places still have Kings or Queens, I will not accept them.
[19:38:06] <jessicara> modern slavery still exists, even though it's very illegal, particularly of migrants and people who can't defend themselves it seems
[19:38:45] <joe7057> Joanna the only time I would consider conscription to be valid would be if the homeland itself is invaded. Even then, if it is necessary than the society perhaps deserves to fall, if its men are not willing to defend it.
[19:39:00] <jessicara> conscription is a tough one
[19:39:11] <jessicara> it results in lower quality fighters - but might need all hands on deck
[19:39:13] <joe7057> JimBuntu in the past yes. But e.g. the British monarchy do not own the British people. 
[19:39:16] <Joanna> JimBuntu: anyone who has to get approval of a government authority to do normal things in life is to some extent a slave in my opinion
[19:39:56] <JimBuntu> joe7057, the reason they don't own them anymore (in Britain) is because they are all now peasents.  There was and is a difference.
[19:40:18] <joe7057> jessicara it depends on the situation definitely. But it should not be permitted for invading another country, or even sending soldiers to defend an ally. Only for homeland defense, in my opinion.
[19:40:24] <Joanna> I agree conscription is better than being conquered but often it’s not for defense at all .
[19:40:28] <joe7057> JimBuntu I know that
[19:40:43] <joe7057> Joanna which is why I say it should ONLY be permitted for homeland defense.
[19:40:48] <jessicara> there was a tough one where took people on disability benefits and told them to fight or starve
[19:41:01] <jessicara> but when are a small country next to a hostile giant..
[19:41:12] <jessicara> doesn't make it right just shows the desperation
[19:41:25] <joe7057> jessicara which country was that?
[19:41:40] <jessicara> this happened in ukraine, one of the many corrupt things which happened
[19:41:59] <Joanna> jessicara: what country are you ?
[19:42:04] <jessicara> scotland
[19:42:15] <Joanna> Ah interesting:)
[19:42:29] <jessicara> and seems i know too many people who know people close to the ground if that makes sense
[19:42:44] <joe7057> jessicara if they are actually disabled, then that is stupid. But for fit and able men, yes sometimes you are called up to defend your homeland. That is a part of the social contract that is the basis of nation-states.
[19:43:30] <Joanna> Someone who is disabled could help in a war effort in some way
[19:43:54] <JimBuntu> fodder
[19:44:17] <JimBuntu> Although, being physically disabled means only that, physically disabled, could be hella smart
[19:44:26] <Joanna> I was thinking more about making things. War is also about logistics
[19:44:33] <jessicara> even mentally disabled can often do something or other on the support side
[19:44:48] <joe7057> Joanna definitely. Amateurs discuss tactics, professionals discuss logistics. 
[19:44:48] <jessicara> lack of fighters, desperate corrupt officials..
[19:45:06] <Joanna> People used to knit clothing for soldiers etc.
[19:45:17] <JimBuntu> jessicara, as a landowner in Scotland, I demand you refer to me by my title of Lord JimBuntu, lol j/k
[19:45:23] <jessicara> lol
[19:45:34] <joe7057> jessicara look at the way it is described in starship troopers: no matter what problem you have, they will find something you can do that is in service of the country. 
[19:46:06] <Joanna> joe7057: without logistics you will be like Napoleon invading Russia..
[19:46:40] <jessicara> something also overlooked is a lot of tinkerers helped the war effort on the british side
[19:46:49] <jessicara> code breakers, inventors
[19:46:58] <jessicara> all sorts of crazy ideas were welcome
[19:46:59] <JimBuntu> war is war, everyone can help in some way
[19:47:53] <Joanna> The interesting thing about the military though.. is if you have enough propaganda the men will sign themselves up to get killed.
[19:49:00] <Joanna> Then there are places where every man in country has to join military like Switzerland. Or everyone like Israel
[19:49:27] <JimBuntu> I am so torn on the idea of forced military service
[19:49:44] <jessicara> yeah i disagree with it on principle
[19:49:50] <JimBuntu> I like everything about it except the force part
[19:50:05] <Joanna> But you can be sure that the billionaires won’t be donating their sons to the blood sacrifice.
[19:50:19] <jessicara> there was objectors who faught in one war who objected to the other here
[19:50:32] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:50:36] <jessicara> thought it was undue interference
[19:50:53] <JimBuntu> Really, that's the way it should be jessicara , judge everything on it's own merits
[19:51:01] <jessicara> it's going to be hard to convince a brit who's mind is set on this to actually fight
[19:51:09] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[19:51:20] <Joanna> I think if people are scared of their country being conquered there will be no need for conscription.
[19:51:37] <JimBuntu> "A rifle behind every blade of grass"
[19:52:09] <Joanna> I think men like war though it’s like a big sporting event.
[19:52:36] <JimBuntu> Well, we are wired a certain way, but upbringing means a lot too
[19:52:58] <JimBuntu> For people at the top, it's very much like any other game though
[19:53:09] <Joanna> Men who didn’t like to fight became extinct a long time ago
[19:54:14] <Joanna> It’s very easy to rally people and make them want to kill I’ve noticed.
[19:55:12] <JimBuntu> We are the worst apes because we are also bloodthirsty
[19:55:37] <Joanna> Unless you have special training to not be manipulated I think it’s easy to be tricked into reacting.
[19:56:17] <Joanna> The most vicious well organized group takes over
[19:57:03] <Joanna> You need two things to win. Technology and discipline.
[19:58:25] <Joanna> It’s kind of amazing sometimes how a small number of people can conquer many like Spanish in South America.
[19:59:08] <Joanna> I guess you also need good leadership to not lose.
[20:11:14] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[20:15:05] <joe7057> Joanna in the case of Israel, they have no choice. They are surrounded by enemies on all sides who want their total extermination, and who have  invaded in the past and surely will again.
[20:15:51] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[20:18:58] <JimBuntu> Well, they could resolve that by moving, joe7057 ...  I know it wouldn't end the fighting, but there would be a lot less of it.  note: I don't think that land should belong to any one nation.
[20:19:58] <JimBuntu> I also don't think Mecca should belong to a nation either, but wow, saying that can get you killed quickly.
[20:20:32] <joe7057> JimBuntu it has always been, and will always be the case that land belongs to the nation that can defend it.
[20:20:47] <JimBuntu> And that is why the wars will continue
[20:22:00] <joe7057> The wars continue because the nations arount Israel hate Israel, and that is because Israel is a country of Jews. If Hamas laid down their weapons there would be peace. If Israel laid down their weapons there would be nothing but dead Jews.
[20:22:54] <JimBuntu> Well, I don't think Hamas is the only group that would need to give up outside of Israel
[20:23:20] <joe7057> certainly. They are one of the main instigators though, thanks to their continued bombardment of Israel withrockets.
[20:23:50] <JimBuntu> If that land was controlled by a group of nations, perhaps a group of united nations, things would be different.
[20:24:27] <JimBuntu> yup, Hamas is a big issue, I totally agree. In the vacuum of their demise though, other groups would rise to take over the position.
[20:24:35] *** Joins: Roey (~Roey@user/Roey)
[20:25:38] <joe7057> JimBuntu the united nations is a completely toothless organization. As long as they continue to have members such as Saudi Arabia on their womens rights council, and other such nonsense, they deserve nothing but contempt
[20:26:05] <JimBuntu> I agree about the UN and that is why I worded it the way I did, as not to invoke the existing UN
[20:33:48] <joe7057> ah okay, I misunderstood
[20:33:53] <Joanna> joe7057: I suspect that Israel is a puppet state of Britain who was conveniently in control of Palestine when it was founded. The purpose of Israel seems to be for doing the dirty work in the Middle East . I’ve also heard that it’s very well funded by us tax dollars. The Whole way in which Israel has come to be has a lot in common with british style manifest destiny. With the Arabs being treated like native Americans. There are 
[20:33:53] <Joanna> also rumors that hamas is funded by the west to create chaos in much the same way as blm.
[20:34:20] <joe7057> well they are certainly funded by a network of Islamic charity fronts in the west anyway
[20:34:36] <Joanna> They could have created a non segregated country but they didn’t
[20:35:35] <Joanna> It’s hard to really know what is happening but false flag operations are fairly common tactic.
[20:36:37] <joe7057> Israel itself is non-segregated. The problem is that the people in the other country refuse to accept a two-state solution, because they want the eradication of Israel. 
[20:37:40] <Joanna> From what I heard Israel just expanded and took most of the land.
[20:38:13] <joe7057> yes to push the enemy artillery out of range of their cities.
[20:38:44] <Joanna> It’s a bad situation for both Jews and Arabs by design.
[20:40:03] <Joanna> There is a simple solution to solving the problem of Israel. Make every Jew marry an Arab. Problem solved.
[20:40:34] <joe7057> yeah good luck with that.
[20:41:16] <Joanna> But rest assured there are people who like things just as they are.
[20:42:11] <Joanna> Every problem has people benefitting which is why problems are never solved.
[20:42:16] <joe7057> there always are
[20:43:09] <Joanna> It’s so frustrating to see the most simple to solve problems such as choking on air pollution go unsolved.
[20:43:43] <joe7057> well thats China for you
[20:46:35] <Joanna> I blame the cars
[20:46:37] <JimBuntu> Jews are arabs though. I figure you mean they should marry an islamic person.  Wont solve it though as no upstanding Jew would marry someone who practiced Islam and no upstanding Islam would marry a Jew. Conflicting belief structures.
[20:47:07] <Joanna> I don’t know where the smells of burning plastic come from
[20:48:13] <Joanna> Muslim men are allowed to marry any religion they like , Muslim women aren’t.
[20:48:43] <JimBuntu> yeah, marry anyone you want and convert them, I think that's the point.
[20:48:56] <Joanna> They could try to get spouse to convert
[20:49:19] <Joanna> Or practice both religions
[20:49:46] <JimBuntu> You can't practice both if devout to either. You could only do that if they are watered down.
[20:50:24] <Joanna> The whole dividing by religion is just an idea it doesn’t have to be that way it’s done on purpose.
[20:50:44] <JimBuntu> Of course it's done on purpose, it's a founding principal of religion
[20:50:56] <Joanna> Why not learn both books and celebrate all holidays
[20:51:34] <JimBuntu> Learn both? No problem. Celebrate all holidays? No problem.
[20:51:47] <JimBuntu> Obey both strictly? Problem.
[20:51:59] <Joanna> Could you imagine if America was divided up by religion and you had to fight everyone who was a different religion?
[20:52:18] <JimBuntu> That's where watering things down comes into play.
[20:52:26] <Joanna> Jews and Muslims have a lot in common
[20:52:47] <JimBuntu> Of course they do, Islam is based on Judaism.
[20:53:01] <pipmik> hey!
[20:53:06] <pipmik> may i join?
[20:53:11] <JimBuntu> always and of course
[20:53:15] <Joanna> People are just easy to divide
[20:53:17] <pipmik> what is the topic?
[20:53:29] <JimBuntu> lol, right now the topic is solving world peace
[20:53:36] <pipmik> lol
[20:53:50] <Joanna> pipmik: did you find answer to your question earlier?
[20:53:59] <pipmik> there is no solving world peace right now and in the future
[20:54:05] <pipmik> Joanna: i couldn't
[20:54:21] <Joanna> JimBuntu: might know the answer
[20:54:41] <JimBuntu> oof, I hope I will know or be able to guide.  What was the question pipmik ?
[20:55:34] <pipmik> JimBuntu: my question is how to extract email addresses from a domain? "but" not in the email addresses in a webpage. i mean email addresses from a domain that connected to an email server
[20:55:38] <pipmik> is this possible?
[20:55:44] <JimBuntu> Oh, is it the email extraction from domain question?  If so, have you tried connecting to their email server(s) and using the VRFY command?
[20:56:55] <JimBuntu> An email server will not simply give you a list of the known email addresses unless you are an admin or can otherwise access it's database... but... given time, you can write a script to check via brute force.
[20:57:20] <pipmik> JimBuntu: umm i have no access to that email server
[20:57:42] <pipmik> for brute force i should have a really big word list right?
[20:57:47] <JimBuntu> You have some level of acce4ss, that's how email works... it requires email servers to provide a level of public access
[20:58:23] <JimBuntu> well pipmik , I wouldn't use a wordlist, just build the possible prefix in the program and perhaps log the successes and failures.
[20:58:35] <pipmik> and for brute force thing that email server shouldn't have all catch right? as i know if they have verify blocking then i can't verify
[20:58:58] <JimBuntu> I would suggest, very much, that you try to determine any patters they use... such as first name initial followed by last name or whatever... but if pure brute force, it doesn't matter
[20:59:14] <pipmik> i see
[20:59:31] <pipmik> i guess there is no white light for me in this tunnel
[20:59:36] <JimBuntu> Yeah, they will likely have some sort of catchall, but I can't remember if that effects vrfy.  If they don't allow vrfy at all, then this method will not work and you will need to do more research
[21:00:56] <pipmik> no worries
[21:02:07] <pipmik> by the way for world peace we should change people'mind with an ultra magnetic weapon with lots of satellite. just imagining
[21:02:24] <JimBuntu> Dang it, space lasers with magnets it is!
[21:03:13] <pipmik> absolutely!
