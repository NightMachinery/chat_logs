[00:00:24] <Zipheir> pinoaffe: To be blunt, Lassi seems to just want Scheme to be run like a startup.
[00:00:52] <gwatt> where else should they discuss scheme, and specifically the r7rs process? here?
[00:01:13] <amazigh> he is not the only one. Calling RnRS a "product" makes me thing of startup scene, and short-term vision.
[00:01:34] <Zipheir> gwatt: I mean the R7RS-Medium project, which all of the recent mail is tagged under.
[00:01:48] <Zipheir> gwatt: It's been an absolute deluge in the past few days.
[00:02:12] <gwatt> Oh I know. I've been observing
[00:02:45] <amazigh> that is not really r7rs wg2 topic imo
[00:03:04] <amazigh> the problem is there is not other venue to gather the tribe(s)
[00:03:17] <Zipheir> Starting mls is cheap.
[00:03:26] <amazigh> :D
[00:03:28] <gwatt> My favorite has been the person asserting that other people think r6rs vs r7rs is a zero-sum game
[00:03:29] <Zipheir> And there's (gasp!) IRC.
[00:04:05] <Zipheir> gwatt: I tend to agree with Martin that there is some implicit zero-sum thinking.
[00:04:49] <Zipheir> R5+, R6, and R7 have actually been coexisting peacefully for as long as I've been using Scheme.
[00:05:01] <amazigh> with that I agree.
[00:05:23] <mdhughes> I vote we just forget R7 and use R6. It's been pretty effective for me.
[00:06:24] <Zipheir> Zero-sum thinking! ;-)
[00:06:43] <amazigh> ahah!
[00:06:53] <mdhughes> No more years. No more progress. We have a working thing, just write some code and use it.
[00:06:55] <Zipheir> Everyone is running around saying "everyone should just use my favorite homebrew".
[00:07:05] <gwatt> They've been co-existing in that everyone just picks which version they want to use. I think at this point it's a fair concern to want to not see future rnrs versions continue on like that
[00:07:10] <Zipheir> I kid.  The homebrew is some special blend of various standards.
[00:07:20] <amazigh> Zipheir: exactly
[00:08:10] <amazigh> gathering to think about where the language could go and improve is an interesting exercise
[00:08:17] <amazigh> C99 is still a thing
[00:08:20] <Zipheir> gwatt: I can't see how yet another split is going to fix that, though.
[00:08:53] <Zipheir> "Is this R7-small, R7-large, or R7-medium?"
[00:09:03] <mdhughes> I did hear Linux was going to move to C11? But that's still 11 years old now, about on par with R6.
[00:09:05] <amazigh> or is it c89... anyway Scheme will not be the only one to have several popular standards
[00:10:19] <mdhughes> If people need a specific SRFI for their actual work, it's not that hard to make it portable to R5-7 as is, and some version-specific code can be put in the .sls
[00:10:24] <Zipheir> Exactly.  There's plenty of stuff out there in C89, C99, etc.
[00:10:50] <amazigh> mdhughes: yes, that is why I call for the gathering to think about those SRFI
[00:10:51] <mdhughes> But I'd like to see a lot more emphasis in the specs on libraries used in actual running code.
[00:10:58] <gwatt> While that's true, other languages' standards have usually paid more attention to compatibility. C for example didn't add a module system in one version and then change it in the next
[00:11:15] <amazigh> actual running code is very broad to cover in the general case
[00:11:33] <mdhughes> Yeah, the library/define-library thing is obnoxious. Every file needs a silly wrapper.
[00:11:41] <Zipheir> gwatt: That is an unfortunate incompatibility between R6 and R7.
[00:11:42] <amazigh> gwatt: both can live along with includes
[00:11:53] *** Quits: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec) (Quit: ec)
[00:12:00] <gwatt> which is definable but not specified in R6RS
[00:12:05] <Zipheir> I think the reality is probably that there won't be many new R6RS implementations.
[00:12:53] <amazigh> the latest is the greatest ;)
[00:13:17] <gwatt> What's the newest scheme implementation? I suspect there aren't going to be too many new scheme implementations, no matter the report number
[00:13:40] <pinoaffe> Zipheir: I personally quite like the idea of a tower of documents, where each extends the previous - and a well-defined set of "standard" modules larger than small but smaller than large sounds like a nice baseline for portable code (but take my opinion with a grain of salt, I'm very new to this whole scheme thing)
[00:13:46] <Zipheir> Well, aside from Chez, Guile and Racket are both moving in their own directions, and none of the R5+ implementations are talking about R6...
[00:14:09] <Zipheir> gwatt: That, too.
[00:14:33] <mdhughes> Gambit's allegedly R7RS, but it's hardly new.
[00:14:39] <Zipheir> pinoaffe: If only documents had a nice algebraic structure!
[00:14:47] <amazigh> Zipheir: you message was flagged as spam x)
[00:14:48] <Zipheir> Gambit?  No way.
[00:15:09] <Zipheir> Gerbil added some R7RS libraries, but there's no way Feeley's getting on board with that.
[00:15:16] <Zipheir> amazigh: Hah, oh well.
[00:16:01] <mdhughes> The new version runs well enough. With Marc's help I got define-library running. It's weird, but seems to have the half-assed nobody-defined-this tone of R7 in general.
[00:16:17] <amazigh> Is there a technical reason the create a new Scheme from scratch?
[00:16:37] <pinoaffe> Zipheir: yeah gimme a scheme implementing R7RS * R6RS + R5RS
[00:16:54] <gwatt> Zipheir: the gambit site claims gambit is r[457]rs
[00:17:06] <mdhughes> A WASM-specific Scheme might be a useful new thing.
[00:17:30] <gwatt> There was one half-being worked on by a googler
[00:17:44] <Zipheir> gwatt: !  I'm amazed.
[00:18:01] <Zipheir> I thought it would be R5RS until the endtimes.
[00:18:32] <Zipheir> amazigh: If you're looking for performance, probably not.
[00:18:55] <Zipheir> pinoaffe: R47RS
[00:22:44] <amazigh> lol
[00:23:28] <amazigh> there is another scheme on wasm
[00:24:03] <amazigh> it is written in wasm https://github.com/pollrobots/scheme

[00:27:28] <pinoaffe> ooh, since the perl people chose to abandon the "perl 6" name we should namesquat perl 6 and exclusively refer to R47RS as "Perl 6"

[00:53:34] <Zipheir> dpk: I mean, I very much hope you aren't being singled out.
[00:56:32] <mdhughes> I mostly like the roadmap. My main concern with R7RS-small is Unicode's complete undefinition. And I don't see any solution to that in any proposals, except "string-ref in linear time"
[00:56:54] <dpk> shrug. as long as people understand the actual point, that e.g. people who want to work on the core of R7RS are not conspiring against people who want to work on portable libraries, i guess it's fine
[00:57:23] <dpk> mdhughes: a more minimal requirement would be to require that repeatedly calling string-ref on consecutively increasing/decreasing indexes has linear performance
[00:57:55] <dpk> that would explicitly allow the approach used by Emacs, soon to be used by Chicken, and possibly to be used by Chibi if Alex accepts my patch: just cache the byte offset of the last codepoint index requested
[00:58:27] <dpk> only two extra words on every string and you can use UTF-8
[00:59:11] <mdhughes> Sure, but I also want character classes and Unicode awareness of casing, and encodings for I/O.
[00:59:52] * dpk nods
[00:59:59] <mdhughes> The only one of those I currently *use* is encodings, but if I write an editor or something, I want classes.
[01:00:16] <dpk> that would be more in the realm of actual Large than the proposed Medium effort, i think, but we could certainly consider it

[01:06:52] <Franciman> speaking of which, how does one usually write parsers in scheme?
[01:06:56] <Franciman> do you know any examples?
[01:07:27] <dpk> i've used (chibi parse), which is moderately tolerable, and (ice-9 peg), which is more tolerable
[01:07:39] <dpk> (parser combinators in the former case, PEGs with packrat parser in the latter)
[01:07:40] <gwatt> Ideally, I just use "read"
[01:08:40] <mdhughes> What gwatt said. Tho for non-sexpr languages, I write a char-by-char state machine like usual.
[01:09:12] <mdhughes> I've got a bunch of them, from JSON to various config & adventure file format languages.

[01:10:27] <Zipheir> We don't have a good portable LALR(1) generator.

[22:23:11] <amazigh> I am reading again Software Designed for Flexibility
[22:23:14] <amazigh> it is a great read
[22:23:28] <johnjaye> amazigh: i started reading it but forgot
[22:23:37] <johnjaye> the first chapter seemed too heavy on references tbh
[22:23:51] <johnjaye> like it kept talking about hox genes. or box genes. or something
[22:23:59] <amazigh> references like links to other papers?
[22:24:14] <johnjaye> as in referenes to anything. esp hox genes.
[22:24:29] <johnjaye> as i didn't have a way to copy paste links from the book to my pc it was somewhat underwhelming
[22:25:02] <amazigh> hox genes?
[22:25:02] * johnjaye recalls hearing advice for first time writers... don't cite others or rely on others. tell me what *you* know
[22:25:11] <amazigh> sorry if you do not already know I am not a native speaker
[22:25:30] <johnjaye> genes that determine the layout of vertebrates
[22:25:40] <amazigh> ah i skipped those :p
[22:25:41] <johnjaye> that was the metaphor it kept relying on to explain software flexibility
[22:25:52] <johnjaye> it's just like genes for skeletons guys
[22:26:19] <johnjaye> did you make some good software from it
[22:26:20] <amazigh> you are not forced to read the references, but it is nice to have a backing reference to say that is not "hot air"
[22:26:31] <amazigh> no
[22:27:09] <johnjaye> well. i kind of lose interest if i can't at least follow along with my own scheme system like chez or chicken

[22:50:23] <Zipheir> johnjaye: But a huge amount of academic writing is responding to/building on stuff that others have written.
[22:51:07] <Zipheir> It's also unfortunate to tell students that writing is about "telling me what you know".  Boo, I don't want to read that.
