[15:37:06] <lantech19446> is python respected by employers as a programming language or is it considered just a scripting language? I've seen it listed as both in job listings but I can't discern what the more popular opinion is
[16:01:48] <rawtaz> it's considered both
[16:12:06] <dodo> it's a general purpose language..

[18:07:26] <Deknos> do you really have an application for that nowadays? back then in disaster recovery it could help, but nowadays machines are just resetup.. 
[18:13:39] <rawtaz> someone either did or asked an XY question
[18:20:41] <Deknos> ah
[18:22:17] <Deknos> but yeah, it's fascinating how much we do not know of the coreutils, let alone, moreutils, sed, awk and m4...
[18:23:11] <rawtaz> yeah :D

[19:15:40] <Deknos> btw: i really really hate IPMI >.<
[19:15:58] <rawtaz> isnt that what you use when you dont have like a dell drac? :)
[19:16:09] <rawtaz> or is HPs thingie named IPMI as well?
[19:16:35] <Deknos> i do not know dell drac, but ipmi almost all servers have.. but the thing is: it sucks. it really sucks. and i kinda do not know why...
[19:17:03] <rawtaz> you should establish yourself on dell servers, their drac is really nice i think
[19:17:48] <Deknos> because the servers we have, i can either use a crappy java binary OR a websystem. but both.. SUCK. is it so hard to build a protocol for a virtual terminal with 600x800? and setting boot configurations?
[19:21:05] <Deknos> lol, there are even ipmi simulators out there: https://github.com/shapeblue/ipmisim
[19:21:25] <rawtaz> hah :)
[19:23:02] <Deknos> i wonder if there is tooling to test for the ipmi protocol so that it's compliant...
[19:23:17] <Deknos> a whole lot of servervendoers would suddenly start sweating...

[23:26:59] <Deknos> just a headsup, if you are a distributor/vendor/distribution which provides ISOs or VM Images, it would be splendid if you reference somewhere in a json file like https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/os_list_imagingutility_v2.json and document that.

[23:40:52] <lantech19446> is cloudformation an IaaS thing?
[23:50:26] <Deknos> yesno
[23:50:57] <Deknos> cloudformation is a tool which lets you deploy with Code elements/components in the AWS cloud, like VMs for example
[23:51:21] <Deknos> it's IaC. and IaaS as AWS has IaaS
[23:53:53] <lantech19446> ok, what exactly is the difference between IaC and IaaS? I thought the terms were interchangeable 
[23:55:30] <rawtaz> lantech19446: uhm its pretty obvious - the first one is *code*, the other one is a *service*
[23:56:00] <rawtaz> you do know what they are acronyms for right?
[23:57:51] <lantech19446> I thought IaaS was still code based though that's why i thought they were interchangeable i thought IaaS was software based infrastructure
[23:58:19] <rawtaz> Infra as Code, Infra as a Service
