[00:56:47] <BaronVladimirHar> I spent years swearing up and down that they had this whole web mess figured out in a browser that barely cost any disk space.
[00:57:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Then they switch to this Chromium junk and spent years not supporting "Linux" even though Chromium ran on it, and then it's a Chinese company so fat chance I'm installing that anyway.
[00:58:19] <BaronVladimirHar> They forced Jon von Tetzchner out, and ruined Opera and sold it to China.
[00:58:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Now they even have some fake VPN that's in the browser and probably spies on you.
[00:58:45] <BaronVladimirHar> I think Mozilla does something like that with Clownflare.

[02:56:10] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: why would flatpaks be better than snaps?
[02:56:13] <BaronVladimirHar> Fedora removed it and called it impossible to correctly secure.
[02:56:18] <Timvde> They're pretty much the same concept
[02:56:30] <BaronVladimirHar> In some ways they are.
[02:56:46] <BaronVladimirHar> Flatpak's sandbox is more generic. Anything with a Linux kernel should be able to run it properly.
[02:56:50] <mefistof1les> Timvde: the implementation is different, as a starter, snaps create a loop volume for each package... I don't like that
[02:57:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Flatpak is 100% Free, even on the server. Anyone can run a repo. 
[02:57:47] <BaronVladimirHar> Flatpak doesn't need a daemon running and eating up over 200 MB of RAM idling even if no Flatpaks are running. Snap does.
[02:57:50] <mefistof1les> on the other hand, big tech really wants to be able to share closed software in these platforms, or else they don't care
[02:58:16] <BaronVladimirHar> Flatpaks ask for permission to update software. Snaps are like Windows 10 and do whatever they hell they want.
[02:59:31] <BaronVladimirHar> Flatpaks are less bloated because the dependency flatpaks can be partially installed with just what you are installing needs out of them. Snaps install THE ENTIRE DEPENDENCY!

[03:15:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Or you could do like Apple. It's UNIX. We paid to get around the conformance tests, here, here, here, here, here, there, here, there, there, and we let 2007 bash stay there for 14 years because we're license bigots and patent trolls.
[03:15:26] <natewrench123456> BaronVladimirHar well OpenIndiana is also Unix
[03:15:36] <BaronVladimirHar> And with no USB 3 support.
[03:15:45] <mefistof1les> UNIX is kinda obsolete, imho
[03:15:46] <BaronVladimirHar> Who cares if you can install it? It's UNIX!
[03:16:02] <natewrench123456> Its a Linux Machine..! I know this
[03:16:12] <BaronVladimirHar> I hate Oracle. I hate them so much.
[03:16:23] <BaronVladimirHar> I started to switch to OpenSolaris. 
[03:16:33] <natewrench123456> and they discontinue it
[03:16:35] <BaronVladimirHar> Then they yanked it away and killed it off and have this fake RHEL thing.
[03:16:43] <natewrench123456> Oracle Linux
[03:16:50] <mefistof1les> BaronVladimirHar: emotion based decision on these things are commonly not good, if you care about productivity, in my experience
[03:16:56] <natewrench123456> I wonder why Oracle Linux doesnt implement ZFS
[03:17:19] <BaronVladimirHar> They also killed Ian Murdock if you think about it.
[03:17:33] <natewrench123456> didnt he suicide in 2015
[03:17:58] <BaronVladimirHar> They bought Sun, killed his project, chased him out. He took a job at Docker, was in San Francisco for work, and the police harassed him and caused him to have a nervous breakdown.
[03:18:17] <BaronVladimirHar> So in the alternate timeline where Sun wasn't bought, he'd probably still be alive.
[03:18:25] <natewrench123456> hmm true
[03:18:35] <natewrench123456> ian murdock worked for sun, i didnt know that
[03:18:39] <Peng> This is #firefox
[03:18:40] <Peng> You have a blog
[03:18:52] <Peng> I'm watching VTuber clips and every time I alt-tab back to IRC you're ranting about a different company
[03:18:59] <Peng> Please slow it down
[03:19:19] <mefistof1les> I agree with Peng 
[03:20:14] <BaronVladimirHar> I had hope for more from OpenIndiana. About all they did do was make it possible to build without a proprietary dead compiler from Sun, but now it's a dead OS you can build with a Free compiler, which you can't install.
[03:20:32] <mefistof1les> it is very unpleasant to read the messages in this channel when they are all toxic messages unrelated to firefox, and mostly from the same users, I wonder if we have any kind of administration around here
[03:21:08] <natewrench123456> back to firefox, why should users use forks of firefox?
[03:21:34] <BaronVladimirHar> LibreWolf (right now) is a soft fork that is more private, secure, and stable, and less annoying.
[03:21:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Is that not of value?
[03:21:43] <natewrench123456> LibreWolf, Pale Moon
[03:21:57] <BaronVladimirHar> They follow Firefox closely. It's not some broken old forked engine.
[03:22:05] <natewrench123456> soft fork
[03:22:18] <BaronVladimirHar> It's actually ahead of Firefox in a few ways.
[03:22:29] <BaronVladimirHar> It's using Wayland by default NOW and it's using LLVM 13 for builds.
[03:22:31] <mefistof1les> use whatever suits you best
[03:23:10] <BaronVladimirHar> So it performs a lot better, especially on GNU/Linux where Firefox hobbles around on an abstraction layer that's based on a 40 year old graphics setup.
[03:23:27] <natewrench123456> 40 year old graphics setup? from Netscape likely
[03:23:31] <BaronVladimirHar> (While also demanding THE MOST CURRENT Mesa)
[03:23:50] <BaronVladimirHar> X11, my god....seriously...Now?
[03:23:52] <natewrench123456> Well usually I'd use a fork of the original so LibreWolf works
[03:24:00] <BaronVladimirHar> What could possibly be the hold up?
[03:24:30] <mefistof1les> BaronVladimirHar: lack of human resources and it works, does the job
[03:24:39] <BaronVladimirHar> I overrode Firefox defaults and turned Wayland support on myself, and the WebRender Compositor.
[03:24:49] <mefistof1les> wayland is not even thought as an xorg replacement, so it won't ever cover all the current use cases for xorg
[03:25:11] <BaronVladimirHar> If they want to default to some deranged 1980s graphics system, that's their business I guess.
[03:25:33] <mefistof1les> yeah, feel free not to use it
[03:25:42] <BaronVladimirHar> It's not meant to cover every possible use case. Nor should it.
[03:25:48] <mefistof1les> yeah, feel free not to use it
[03:25:53] <BaronVladimirHar> A lot of those use cases are things that nobody will ever use again.
[03:25:56] <natewrench123456> well I used firefox heavily in school, before that netscape navigator
[03:26:16] <Timvde> mefistof1les: we do, I am a channel operator, and there are a few other users too
[03:26:19] <BaronVladimirHar> The only modern example of something intentionally consuming X Toolkit that I know of, is XScreenSaver.
[03:26:56] <mefistof1les> Timvde: ok, good to know
[03:27:24] <natewrench123456> Netscape Navigator until 2004 then firefox
[03:27:35] <BaronVladimirHar> The people who bag on Wayland have no idea what it is, why X11 is untenable, and may have had a run in with XWayland while it performed much worse than it does now.

[03:28:25] <BaronVladimirHar> GNOME Web got rid of its last X11 dependencies a while back. Partially by cheating off Firefox's homework.
[03:28:28] <Timvde> mefistof1les: I agree the rants are annoying, and I have already said so (without outing myself as a channel operator though)
[03:28:43] <Timvde> But well, I guess here we are :P
[03:28:50] <mefistof1les> Timvde: yeah :/
[03:29:13] <mefistof1les> I'm just going to ignore the user, hope that helps
[03:29:35] <BaronVladimirHar> It needed X11 to implement NPAPI, for Flash, and then later just Evince. Evince is a full blown document viewer that handles PDF much better than pdf.js from Mozilla, but to drop NPAPI, pdf.js replaced the Evince plug-in.
[03:30:17] <BaronVladimirHar> Usually what you get with fillable forms in Mozilla's PDF.js is errors that it can't actually do it properly.
[03:30:28] <BaronVladimirHar> So you then need to save it and use Evince anyway.
[03:30:47] <BaronVladimirHar> Which also comes up in Firefox. :)
[03:31:05] <natewrench123456> the firefox color option is cool
[03:31:53] <mefistof1les> Timvde: I guess it is also a meme now to talk firefox down... it's just the usual "kick them while they are down" kinda of mentality that is shown by many humans
[03:31:53] <natewrench123456> colorways
[03:31:57] <BaronVladimirHar> It was a quick way to remove some more rotting code that was not feasible to port. The ad blocker story at least worked out better than this.
[03:32:30] <natewrench123456> Unless Mozilla is willing to reinvent firefox or move control over to Mozilla Corp, it will always use x11
[03:32:53] <BaronVladimirHar> It needs an overhaul in numerous ways.
[03:32:56] <Timvde> So, BaronVladimirHar: can you please tone down on the rants? Especially the ones that are not Firefox related, and when talking about Firefox please do so in a more constructive way.
[03:33:37] <BaronVladimirHar> Okay, I like your Reader Mode code apparently. That's from Firefox.
[03:33:46] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[03:34:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Mac users view (or at least viewed) Firefox from a similar lens.
[03:35:02] <natewrench123456> isnt firefox on ios a fork of safari
[03:35:08] <BaronVladimirHar> It's this "cross platform" app that doesn't blend in or perform ideally.
[03:35:37] <Timvde> natewrench123456: Not a fork, but it uses Webkit, yes
[03:35:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Nope, Safari uses Webkit, like GNOME Web does now as well, and Webkit is Apple's KHTML fork.
[03:35:44] <Timvde> No other options on iOS
[03:35:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Oh, on iOS.
[03:35:59] <BaronVladimirHar> Yes, but I hear Firefox is also limited more on iOS.
[03:36:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Like, Apple not only mandates Webkit, but locks Firefox out of all of their newest APIs.
[03:36:33] <natewrench123456> about:mozilla makes me wish Mozilla would write the Book of Mozilla and make it a manifesto or constitution
[03:36:37] <BaronVladimirHar> And even though you can view NSFW stuff in any browser, kids can use Safari, but Firefox is 17+ in the app store.
[03:36:38] <Timvde> I thought they didn't do that anymore
[03:36:50] <Timvde> They used to not give other apps access to the JIT, but nowadays they do
[03:36:53] <Timvde> And it's just the same engine
[03:37:41] <BaronVladimirHar> I have GNOME Web kind of jacked up to partially use Firefox Sync. It doesn't handle synced passwords right, but everything else works fine.
[03:37:43] <Timvde> (I may be mistaken though, I don't follow iOS closely)
[03:38:03] <BaronVladimirHar> Then on the Android end, I have Fennec F-Droid, which pries out all of the blobs from Firefox, and that syncs with GNOME Web.
[03:38:34] <BaronVladimirHar> JIT is nice and it's not.
[03:38:47] <BaronVladimirHar> Interpreter is slower, but precludes many security hazards.
[03:39:07] <BaronVladimirHar> Once JIT becomes involved, it becomes harder to sanitize what will actually run, though it is faster.
[03:39:08] <natewrench123456> using Firefox Sync doesnt store your information on Mozilla Servers?
[03:39:36] <BaronVladimirHar> It does store information there, yes.
[03:39:59] <BaronVladimirHar> But the agreement for Firefox Sync isn't the same as Suggest and Pocket, which sends it to some sleazy ad company.
[03:40:04] <Timvde> natewrench123456: it's end to end encrypted
[03:40:10] <Timvde> So it's stored there, but Mozilla can't actually read it
[03:40:12] <BaronVladimirHar> They have separate EULAs for their services (and disservices).
[03:40:22] <natewrench123456> What is Suggesty
[03:40:32] <BaronVladimirHar> It's a keylogger.
[03:40:43] <natewrench123456> Mozilla owns Pocket 
[03:40:47] <BaronVladimirHar> Everything you type into the address bar goes to an ad company via Mozilla.
[03:40:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Suggest is different.
[03:40:58] <natewrench123456> I remeber they did something with Amazon
[03:41:04] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla goes to some outfit called buysellads.
[03:41:16] <BaronVladimirHar> If you use Firefox, turn it off!
[03:41:21] <BaronVladimirHar> It does nothing good.

[03:46:37] <BaronVladimirHar> It won't be Google soon, apparently.
[03:46:43] <BaronVladimirHar> It'll be Microsoft BONG.
[03:46:46] <BaronVladimirHar> The mask comes off.
[03:47:07] <BaronVladimirHar> Everything on GitHub, Bing for searching....keylogger malware to drive ads.
[03:49:23] <BaronVladimirHar> DuckDuckGo isn't all that private, and it's basically a mask for Bing so the search results aren't terrific, but at least it doesn't force you to log in if you use a VPN.
[03:49:56] <BaronVladimirHar> I tried StartPage, but it started "disabling my access" and asking me to tell them if I was using a VPN or something. It became more obnoxious than Google.
[03:50:26] <BaronVladimirHar> I can't use Google because I don't want to log in, and they harass VPN users, so I'm sort of stuck with either Bing or DDG right now.
[03:51:07] <BaronVladimirHar> I tried Brave Search. It was pretty much junk. Irrelevant..... Didn't mess with my VPN though. Will monitor situation.
[03:51:21] <BaronVladimirHar> Qwant is some crazy French thing with lots of ads that scrapes Bing.
[03:51:53] <BaronVladimirHar> I think that search is more depressing than the browsers, honestly. So it's fitting that this is all playing out together.
[03:53:13] <BaronVladimirHar> I can't see what point it serves Mozilla to go "Nyaaaah!" with the Bing "experiment" on unwilling participants chosen at random, who will be quite annoyed.
[03:53:29] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft probably won't pay them what Google does now.
[03:53:55] <natewrench123456> Microsoft would probbably steal code from firefox and put it in EDGE
[03:54:16] <BaronVladimirHar> They already do.
[03:54:26] <BaronVladimirHar> It's in the list of licenses in About Edge.
[03:54:40] <BaronVladimirHar> The Netscape Portable Runtime and some other things.
[03:54:40] <natewrench123456> I thought microsoft doesnt like to use copyleft licenses
[03:54:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Because Chromium swiped it first, probably.
[03:55:03] <BaronVladimirHar> They don't like copyleft licenses.
[03:55:48] <BaronVladimirHar> But firing almost the whole browser team and parasiting off of open source speaks their language I guess. Especially when Google and Apple were so nice to keep the LGPL 3 and GPL 3 out of it.
[03:56:25] <natewrench123456> technically its permissive open source so its libre on first download of source
[03:56:46] <BaronVladimirHar> GPLv3 addresses a lot of threats that 2 didn't specifically address, mostly involving DRM, locked bootloaders, patent aggression, and anti-competitive deals like the Microsoft-Novell pact (grandfathering that one, but Novell went broke).
[03:57:32] <BaronVladimirHar> The BSD people hate it, but they also hate Apache 2.0 because it precludes giving people software then filing patent lawsuits against them over it.
[03:58:54] <natewrench123456> I find the MPL the best license because its libre but allows for linking
[03:59:03] <BaronVladimirHar> natewrench123456: Right, then after that, they can do whatever they want. Oddly, the BSD people are always mad if you guarantee everyone else gets their freedom (GPL), but love it when it gets wrapped with proprietary binary-only licenses (Apple and Microsoft).
[03:59:53] <natewrench123456> thats why im afraid of using librewolf because they could have stuff in there thats not MPL'd

[04:00:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Because Facebook bought Netscape Communications Corporation.

[04:07:06] <BaronVladimirHar> About the only way you can violate a BSD license is to strip the original copyright headers (or if it's an old one, not comply with the Annoying Advertising Clause).
[04:07:41] *** Joins: `St0ner (~services@user/st0ner/x-3205467)
[04:08:41] <BaronVladimirHar> The Annoying Advertising Clause actually is incompatible with the GPL. It's a further restriction on use or distribution, which is not allowed by the GPL.
[04:08:44] <BaronVladimirHar> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/bsd.html
[04:08:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Thankfully, I don't think anything modern uses that one.
[04:10:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Essentially, the Annoying Advertising Clause meant that every time someone TOUCHED the code, you had to attribute that person in any materials accompanying the work. Imagine printing the contributors of Linux if you wanted to give someone a boxed set, or including it in a really massive file somewhere. Imagine if every open source program did this. :)
[04:11:22] <BaronVladimirHar> In source forms, this is on the license headers or the COPYING file, but those aren't in compiled code.
[04:14:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Just making sure you comply with licensing is hard work, I know first hand.
[04:15:14] <BaronVladimirHar> That's another thing about Ubuntu. Their lawyers get creative in ways that can get their customers sued.
[04:15:36] <BaronVladimirHar> (ZFS), but they got mentioned as to Firefox in Snaps.
[04:15:55] <BaronVladimirHar> My position is that if Ubuntu has touched it, I don't want it anywhere near me.

[11:01:15] <Timvde> Cork: pipewire is new, I have hope that it ill be great :)
[11:01:42] <Cork> Timvde: so do i, but new != not cause of problems
[11:02:12] <Cork> fedora has been using it for about a year and had a ton of problems with it, and i moved over to it my self about a month ago and had some problems too
[11:02:49] <Cork> pulseaudio got a TON of shit back when it was new cause of the horrible state of drivers, but it isn't THAT bad. So i don't blame it specifically
[11:03:23] <Timvde> Cor
[11:04:04] <Timvde> Cork: no, I meant: so there are still some issues that have to be sorted out atm, but it's progressing and I think it'll be stable soonish
[11:04:24] <Cork> ya, definitely
[11:04:35] <Timvde> Pulseaudio has mostly worked for me, so I don't have too many complaints either
[11:05:01] <Cork> what specifically makes pipewire interesting is that is is meant to handle audio AND video, microphons and not to forget wayland
[11:05:25] <Timvde> I'm gonna get a new work laptop in a week, and I'm gonna try the full "new" stack, wayland and pipewire
[11:05:33] <Timvde> Let's hope it works out :p
[11:05:55] <Cork> using it at home, has worked fine (as long as you stay WAAAAY away from nvidia)
[11:06:12] <Cork> wayland is horrible on nvidia hardware
[11:06:14] <Timvde> Integrated graphics I think
[11:06:21] <Timvde> But I should check
[11:06:30] <Cork> ya, it has worked out of the box no fiddling required for years
[11:07:02] <Cork> kde is, not fully there but gnome works well
[11:07:22] <Timvde> KDE user though
[11:07:37] <Cork> then expect glitches
[11:07:59] <Cork> menues jumping around and content not showing and stuff like that
[11:08:08] <Cork> wayland support is alpha in kde i would say
[11:08:28] <Timvde> But in the last few releases, the Wayland improvements seemed more like finishing touches than fixing important broken things
[11:08:37] <Timvde> (Just from the release notes)
[11:08:56] <Cork> unless the glitches is from nvidia (uses gnomeshell on an xps13 for the last 4 years, and kde on all my other computers)
[11:09:17] <Cork> ya, not my experieces though
[11:09:17] <Timvde> I can always revert if necessary
[11:09:38] <Timvde> I do need HDMI and screen sharing to work
[11:09:44] <Cork> ya, sddm can easily switch between wayland and x11
[11:10:19] <Timvde> Oh well, we'll see
[11:10:22] <Cork> hdmi is driver so has nothing to do with the compositing
[11:10:30] <Timvde> It's a work computer, so stability is the most important
[11:10:31] <Cork> screen sharing depends on what you mean by it
[11:10:43] <Cork> then i would stay with x11 for now
[11:10:53] <Cork> give kde about another year
[11:10:54] <Timvde> Cork: hmm, it doesn't? I mean, no scaling issues etc
[11:11:16] <Timvde> I can always revert if it doesn't work out
[11:11:18] <Cork> hdmi is just how the driver/graphic card pushes the pixel data to the screen
[11:11:20] *** Quits: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.104.50) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:11:45] <Cork> scaling unles you use hardware upscale is before the driver
[11:11:55] <Cork> most computers use software scaling or native rez
[11:12:11] <Cork> and many screens don't even have hardware scaling now days
[11:12:39] <Cork> (so if you don't render nativly you get a centered smaller image on the screen)
