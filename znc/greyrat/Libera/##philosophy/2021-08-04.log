[13:31:01] <tokko> I hope you all are having a good day. I feel good as I have been feeling growing interest forward the philosophy and found that someones have already thought things so long ago that I have been thinking my whole life. I find stoicism really resonating with my own view of the world.
[13:31:44] <pussipupu> We might know where you work :p
[13:32:09] <spruit11> Glitch Marxism is what we need
[13:32:24] <pussipupu> a lot of people seem to be taking things from stoicism these days

[13:33:34] <spruit11> gonna be a thing.  or,  is a thing
[13:33:49] <pussipupu> Glitch Marxism? nons?
[13:34:09] <spruit11> nons are non-affiliated
[13:34:29] <spruit11> it's about the largest demographic in the US now,  or very large
[13:35:13] <spruit11> mostly believe in God,  but don't go to any church.  mostly staunch nationalist,  but don't believe in any of the institutions.  etc.
[13:35:59] <spruit11> tokko with his stoicism kind-of qualifies as a non
[13:37:23] <pussipupu> Not really, Stoicism doesn't imply religious or theistic stances in either direction
[13:38:01] <spruit11> that's exactly non
[13:38:42] <pussipupu> no, it's orthogonal to

[13:47:25] <arcturus> some of the stoic materials make reference to 'gods'
[13:47:37] <arcturus> like such as meditations etc
[13:49:12] <spruit11> it really depends on what you mean with stoicism.  pretty wide variety of colors to it
[13:49:18] <arcturus> modern podcaster stoicism has probably dumped all that baggage
[13:49:21] <amigojapan> I just got my second shot today!
[13:49:29] <arcturus> that reduces the size of the addressable market
[13:49:35] <DPA> I don't believe in god(s), or rather, I have no reason to. But I decided that after death, there will be what I believe there to be. Because I can't know, but if that happens to be the case,
[13:49:35] <DPA> not only will anyone be right about what they think happens after, but I can believe in whatever I would like the most. So if I'm right, I get anything I want, if I'm wrong, I couldn't know and it won't matter. So believing this can only have a positive outcome!
[13:50:22] <arcturus> shouldnt you have waited for a homegrown japanese vaccine
[13:50:52] <arcturus> in a way it can be seen as more patriotic
[13:52:11] <amigojapan> DPA: I am an agnostic. And I default to not making a judgement on the after life until I either see what the after life is like or my mind disappears
[13:52:41] <amigojapan> arcturus: I don't like patriotic ideas
[13:52:50] <arcturus> DPA: there can indeed be psychological benefits to such fantasies, depending on the subject
[13:53:43] <pussipupu> I'm still waiting for my second dose, slightly annoyingly
[13:54:28] <amigojapan> pussipupu: I got it early in Japan cause I have an underlying condition
[13:54:51] <pussipupu> Well I'm glad you could :)
[13:55:03] <pussipupu> only a few weeks for me to wait now
[13:55:04] <amigojapan> Thanks pussipupu
[13:55:46] <DPA> I think it's the most logical thing to believe in. It's not any less likely than any other possibility, but this possibility gives me the biggest possible reward if it true.
[13:56:02] <amigojapan> pussipupu: I think you are supposed to wait 3 weeks since the first shot and then two weeks from the second shot until it takes total effect
[13:56:23] <mrdata> depends on which vaccine
[13:56:40] <amigojapan> I got Pfizer
[13:56:47] <mrdata> mine was AZ, and 9 weeks between jabs
[13:57:06] <amigojapan> I see mrdata
[13:57:19] <tokko> I don't think my hopes or believes about after life are relevant or helpful in my life, and thinking about it is a waste of time. I would make sense only if there is some things I could do to have a better after life but as I cannot know that it would make me do things that doesn't have an impact and thus would be a waste of my effort.
[13:58:02] <amigojapan> mrdata: do you think there can be racism caused by which company's vaccine you had?
[13:58:40] <mrdata> will someone discriminate by supplier you mean?
[13:58:54] <amigojapan> Yeah mrdata
[13:58:59] <arcturus> yes
[13:59:07] <mrdata> you think you will find pfizer-only donut shops?
[13:59:07] <arcturus> it can be seen as a betrayal
[13:59:19] <amigojapan> We already discriminate but colour of skin
[13:59:27] <arcturus> as opposed to taking a vaccine from shionogi or daiichi sankyo
[13:59:47] <arcturus> you know the chinese prefer sinovac
[14:00:43] <amigojapan> I think following people will start getting moderna soon in Japan
[14:00:45] <mrdata> sinovac i guess was tested on a representive sample of china's population,
[14:01:01] <mrdata> so it makes sense that they would prefer it?

[15:48:55] <Ungwelian> A lot of people think death is a sort of escape.
[15:49:16] <Ungwelian> Whether to heaven or inexistence.
[15:51:20] <Ungwelian> I think we'll all be here forever, based on the law of perpetuity of mass, and cycle of biomatter in ecosystems.
[15:51:34] <Ungwelian> There's just no escaping it anywhere.
[15:52:47] <Ungwelian> In death everything that you are is eaten and you become other living organisms.
[15:53:17] <Ungwelian> So the way we treat Earth in this life has direct consequences for the next ones.
[15:53:41] <spruit11> right,  it's all the circle of life
[15:54:07] <Ungwelian> Yeah.
[15:54:18] <Ungwelian> And there's no escaping social issues either, since those circulate too.
[15:54:20] <spruit11> like we gas the jew,  the jew goes into the ground,  feeds the tomatoes,  we eat the tomatoes.  circle of life

[15:56:20] <rubiksdream>  wouldn't there be no "you" as your particles travel around the cycles of biomatter in ecosystems?
[15:56:32] <rubiksdream> presumably that is what people mean when they say death is a sort of escape
[15:56:38] <rubiksdream> they're referring to their consciousness
[15:56:48] <Ungwelian> It's still me. It's just me in many places.
[15:57:08] <Ungwelian> Those organisms then too have emergent consciousness.
[15:57:11] <rubiksdream> you don't normally identify yourself as the sum total of your constituents
[15:57:25] <Ungwelian> A lot of people are still Cartesian dualists.
[15:57:50] <rubiksdream> i see, just wanted to see what you meant by 'its still me'
[15:58:38] <Ungwelian> I mean, I am my brain. It's sustained by my body, which I also am.
[15:58:53] <Ungwelian> That brain will get eaten. Worms, microbes, so on.
[15:59:00] <Ungwelian> Then I become those worms and microbes.
[15:59:07] <rubiksdream> yes, in a literal sense
[15:59:13] <rubiksdream> but you is not normally used in that way afaik
[15:59:19] <Ungwelian> Yeah.
[16:00:04] <pussipupu> conservation of energy doesn't imply eternal existence of any given system
[16:00:27] <Ungwelian> I think when religions say that "God is completely just", that perpetuity is what they mean.
[16:00:33] <rubiksdream> i was about to say, i think eventually there can be no you (literally) even in this context
[16:00:46] <Ungwelian> Circle of life, you and social issues. Everything stays with you.
[16:00:55] <rubiksdream> unless you think some part of you that is essential is subatomic
[16:01:15] <Ungwelian> rubiksdream, sure. And even fields.
[16:02:01] <rubiksdream> yeah, thats fair enough, there is an unpopular theory of consciousness that relates its origins to microtubules in the brain, which are subject to quantum effects
[16:02:03] <rubiksdream> (could be subject to)
[16:02:22] <rubiksdream> then you could safely stipulate that consciousness is non-local
[16:02:28] <rubiksdream> and then yeah, more or less 'eternal'
[16:03:45] <Ungwelian> From my POV, as an organism, death is of course a threat.

[16:04:03] <rubiksdream> yes, i dont think any organism wants to die

[16:04:50] <Ungwelian> I think it's important to make those distinct. Death and fear of death are not the same thing.
[16:05:15] <Ungwelian> Or any neurosis created by fear of death either.
[16:06:48] <rubiksdream> right, one is pretty much a neutral inevitability, and the other is a natural emotional reaction to said inevitability
[16:06:55] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[16:08:27] <Ungwelian> There's nothing wrong with being afraid of dying.
[16:08:34] <Ungwelian> Of course, courage is still a virtue.
[16:08:47] <spruit11> right,  it's all the natural order
[16:09:39] * Ungwelian is suspicious of spruit's natural order regarding the earlier comment :P
[16:09:58] <spruit11> ;P
[16:11:45] <rubiksdream> a little bit of fear is probably healthy
[16:12:27] <rubiksdream> people do pretty stupid shit when they lose fear of death completely , lol
[16:13:39] <Ungwelian> Yeah. And compassion for it, too, towards yourself and others.
[16:14:13] <rubiksdream> compassion is underrated
[16:14:40] <rubiksdream> with the advent of mindulness in the west it seems like these notions, gratitude, compassion are becoming more relevant
[16:14:56] <spruit11> *coughs*
[16:14:59] <DPA> There are situations in which some animals become naturally suicidal. Some animals let themself be eaten by their children, for example.
[16:15:04] <rubiksdream> haha
[16:15:13] <rubiksdream> (to *coughs*)
[16:15:45] <Ungwelian> I really hope virtue ethics would see a big comeback.
[16:16:01] <spruit11> *coughs more loudly*
[16:16:05] <Ungwelian> :D
[16:16:30] <Ungwelian> It's all so broken down since warrior culture became merchant culture !
[16:18:15] <rubiksdream> DPA that would probably be beneficial to humans, if parents were all capable of that
[16:18:38] <rubiksdream> we'd likely have less of a self-serving attitude contributing to fucking the next generations over with problems we've shelved in our lifetimes
[16:20:28] <DPA> I wonder if animals which do this know that it'll make them die, or if they simply follow their instinct without knowing what they do or why they do it.
[16:23:09] <rubiksdream> i would assume its the latter, but partly because its too hard for me to fathom an animal that is capable of the former
[16:23:37] <rubiksdream> maybe maternal love is capable of making animals perform feats similar to this
[16:34:07] <DPA> I don't think making people care is enough nowadays anymore. We have companies. We have Systems. Systems don't have values. Systems just run, following their own logic, just performing the way they work.
