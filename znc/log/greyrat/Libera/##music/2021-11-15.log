[00:35:43] <TomatoSynth> the movie is good! has all the elements of the show.

[00:41:19] <TomatoSynth> i just watched the trailer. looks better than those prod pics. but not much. looks like a soft reboot of the tv eps? they should do original stories.
[00:41:52] <artao> ah. sure
[00:42:03] <artao> that IS generally a better idea

[00:42:43] <TomatoSynth> LOL what. thats funny. i had no idea about that and i'm currently watching the original show. liking it too.
[00:42:51] <artao> especially since it includes strazynski

[00:44:06] <TomatoSynth> i'm in season 3
[00:44:06] <artao> that's why i'm asking ;)
[00:44:10] <artao> watching the movies too?
[00:44:12] <artao> important
[00:44:31] <TomatoSynth> i heard watching the show front to back is the best course. might check out movies later.
[00:44:46] <artao> the movies fit inline with the tv show
[00:45:04] <artao> i recommend watching them at the appropriate point .... one of which you've missed. the beginnig
[00:45:36] <artao> wait ... isn't it actually called "In the Beginning" i think?
[00:45:39] <TomatoSynth> i've got a friend telling me the movies are kinda ass, and i trust him in other sf things so...
[00:45:48] <artao> LOL yep
[00:46:10] <artao> The Gathering, In the Beginning, Thirdspace, River of Souls, and Call to Arms
[00:46:19] <TomatoSynth> if the show ends on a high note i'll go back. if they're good movies the timeline wont be an issue. 
[00:46:35] <artao> fair nuf
[00:46:50] <artao> anyhow. ... sweet

[00:47:35] <artao> i could use higher quality video :\
[00:47:40] <artao> this is . watchable
[00:47:54] <artao> perhaps i could run it thru an AI neural net upscaler
[00:48:05] <TomatoSynth> the CG is sooo bad compared to ds9. its not a deal breaker but damn. watching this on the projector hurt my eyes.
[00:48:16] <artao> oh, it improves drastically
[00:48:29] <artao> Lightwave, the software, improved drastically
[00:48:55] <artao> NewTek Lightwave ... the Star Trek shows used Electric Image
[00:49:11] <TomatoSynth> it already has improved by season3 ep1, but it hasn't aged well. 
[00:49:27] <artao> lightwave was cheaper. It ended up being a driving factor in the cost of 3D software coming down
[00:49:46] <artao> okay cool. the rangers are introduced. wasn't sure when that happend
[00:49:56] <TomatoSynth> alright professor i believe you :p but the end result is all that matters. 
[00:50:09] <artao> indeed
[00:50:12] <TomatoSynth> wait what are the rangers? the psy-cop group?

[01:09:42] <artao> i believe STRONGLY in versioning ;)
[01:10:21] <artao> i had just bought the iZotope suite on sale, with BreakTweaker and Stutter Edit and Trash 2 and Iris 2 (which i already had)
[01:10:23] <artao> SO
[01:10:37] <artao> the bass is BreakTweaker routed thru Stutter edit
[01:10:44] <artao> and it's a live-manipulated recording
[01:10:48] <artao> so ... yeah
[01:11:22] <artao> StutterEdit is pretty crazy. that's the one in the pack i was most exited about
[01:11:46] <artao> breaktweaker is ... okay. i'll use it now and then. good for source beats to then manipulate
[01:12:01] <artao> Trash 2 i was kinda 'meh' on, but now that I've used it?
[01:12:15] <artao> I will NEVER need another distortion plugin. It. Freakin. Rules!
[01:12:31] <TomatoSynth> cool cool. stutter edit looks cool.
[01:12:58] <artao> honestly? looking at how everything was routed and set up? 
[01:13:07] <artao> i have no idea how or where the bassline came into the picture
[01:13:08] <artao> LOL
[01:13:26] <TomatoSynth> sometimes the best ones be like that
[01:13:52] <artao> somehow the beat -- no bassline in it -- "transformed" thru StutterEdit
[01:13:53] <artao> yeah
[01:14:03] <artao> as Bob Ross said: Happy little accidents
[01:14:08] <artao> OOH! great track title
[01:14:38] <TomatoSynth> for 200 bucks though. idk. might have to demo it sometime.
[01:14:40] <artao> that's why you always hit record when you just jamming and experimenting ;)
[01:14:48] <artao> yeah. on sale the whole pack was like 50

[01:15:02] <artao> subscribe to their mailing list
[01:15:11] <artao> it'll likely go on sale over the holidays

[01:29:51] <artao> it covers pretty much everything but modern synth stuff

[01:30:15] <artao> ah, righto
