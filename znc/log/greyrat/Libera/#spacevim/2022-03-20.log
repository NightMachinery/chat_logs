[16:26:39] <SpaceVimBot> <F1o0T> Hi all, May I ask why REPL options is not showing up while opening a bash script file? When I press SPC l (el) it shows the following : http://img.vim-china.org/download/8ce08eef/file_7456.jpg

[20:20:57] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> sh layer does not include this feature. (re @F1o0T: )
[20:21:56] <SpaceVimBot> <F1o0T> Hmm, I was assuming that REPLing bash command is much more easier than REPLing for C language for example.
[20:23:09] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> Yeah
[20:23:49] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> will add this mapping
[20:24:13] <SpaceVimBot> <F1o0T> Thanks a lot.
[20:41:43] <SpaceVimBot> <F1o0T> May I ask if there is a documentation that shows how can I add  my own keybindings to SpaceVim under SPC a. 
[20:41:43] <SpaceVimBot> <F1o0T> We have an in house vim-plugin, and I want to use some keybindings that decend from SPC a to use this plugin.
