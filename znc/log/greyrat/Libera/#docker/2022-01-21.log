[00:03:16] <luva> trying to get the docker metrics. but it doesnt work, prometheus shows the status as down. what can be the problem ? https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/prometheus/

[00:03:47] <luva> http://localhost:9323/metrics	DOWN
[00:08:38] <luva> curl localhost:9323/metrics gives me the correct metrics. but from the prometheus container, even if I use the hosts IP 192.168.1.3 it doesnt work

[00:17:34] <luva> seems like the manual is a bit weird.... it works when putting   "metrics-addr" : "192.168.1.2:9323" instead of localhost:9323, but in the docs, it says it like this. guess its a typo

[00:26:42] <diverdude> I dont understand... i thought that docker was supposed to cache build steps so that if i build a dockerfile and it fails in L. 14, i then go and correct the error and build again, then steps on L. 1-13 are cached and i can continue from 14.... but it seems to rerun all lines again... Did i misunderstand the layer /caching concept?

[00:42:55] <larsks> diverdude: the layout of your dockerfile can have an impact on the cachability of build steps. 
[00:43:26] <larsks> E.g., if you have "COPY something /somewhere" early in the dockerfile, and file/directory something has changed, that would invalidate all subsequent steps.

[04:42:22] <bancroft> Any dockerfile really, I know there are two forms of the ENTRYPOINT directive in dockerfiles the shell one and the exec one. Now I'm doing some stuff that requires all environment variables and stuff so I decided to use the shell one 
[04:42:56] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[04:42:57] <bancroft> but I also don't want a shell to spawn another process, according to docker I should have the entrypoint trigger the process itself (not a shell that triggers the process)

[04:44:22] <rawtaz> by two forms you mean the "foo" and ["foo"] ones?
[04:44:56] <bancroft> yeah, and I guess you can do ["/someplace/entrypoint.sh"] which is similar to the "foo" form 
[04:46:28] <rawtaz> yes indeed. e.g. https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/a83005b407ee6d810413500d8a041c957fb10cf0/14/bullseye/Dockerfile#L183

[10:19:57] <sudomann> Can someone please explpain why this works in a dockerfile:
[10:20:06] <sudomann> FROM java:8-jdk
[10:20:07] <sudomann> COPY --from=python:3.7-buster / /
[10:20:32] <sudomann> Then we end up with both python3.7 and java8 available in containers that use this image
[10:21:12] <sudomann> Shouldnt the second command completely overwrite the filesystem? Such that `javac` is not available in the container?
[10:22:09] <daddy> No. It copies files. It doesn't replace the filesystem.
[10:22:39] <daddy> It's like adding papers onto a stack of papers, instead of replacing the stack with a new stack.
[10:24:02] <sudomann> So `COPY /my/path /etc/foo` results in nonconflicting files being left in place?
[10:24:36] <sudomann> Wow, I'm suprised they've gotten away with this so long and nothing has broken
[10:25:55] <daddy> It's like copying files normally, is it not?
[10:27:47] <sudomann> Well, I always interpreted `COPY dir dir` as an overwrite. So if `dir` already existed with some files in previous layers, the current layer would end up containing ONLY the source dir files

[14:02:29] <maret> Can (and should) docker be used for running nodejs processes? I have aws setup where I am running a web app which can start temporary node processes(it runs a nodejs script). Then I have 2 additional daily node.js scripts. Right now I am using pm2 because it provides nodejs process management + monitoring dashboard out of the box. I could replace it with docker for but I would still need to manage processes  inside web app and I havent found easy to setup
[14:02:29] <maret>  docker monitoring with notification if something goes wrong , out of the box
[14:26:05] <hazmi35> Of course it can, containers can do anything. You can even emulate raspberry pi environment by just running a container. For "should", how does you exactly store and run these scripts?

I don't like the idea of secrets because they require the passwords to be stored in clear text (as environment variable or file). I've been thinking I could run a shell in the container, add the users interactively and then persist these changes with docker commit.

[19:28:30] <molt> hey all. I'm running a docker container of something called 'LeanTime' (an open source project management solution). Documentation for the project is a bit lacking, but I've deduced that setting up SMTP info is done in a file that isn't accessible unless you mount the app directory locally. When I do that I can't run the application because I get an error loading up the URL for the containerized app. I think it has something to do with 
[19:28:30] <molt> permission errors on the local directory I mounted, but this is a bit outside my expertise area. Anyone have any ideas / could help with suggestions? 
[19:33:08] <rawtaz> molt: not really sure what you mean bu "unles you mount the app directory locally"
[19:33:44] <rawtaz> is the file you want to modify part of the docker image? or is it part of a volume/persistent storage that is separate from the image's contents?

[20:17:09] <rawtaz> (that backfires a lot sometimes, but usually works)
[20:17:20] <molt> the filename is something like config.php I believe
[20:17:47] <molt> but from what the OP is saying (along with everyone else in that thread) these paths need to be persistent
[20:18:20] <rawtaz> yes
[20:18:30] <molt> I have a feeling I'm writing syntax incorrectly or something.
[20:19:19] <rawtaz> so, does that software only present data or do you ever modify data in it?as in, does it only work e.g. against a database where everything is stored, so that there's no need to store files on the leantime server?
[20:19:36] <rawtaz> i assume that there *are* files stored and that they are now stored inside the container, which means that when you remove the container the files will be gone

[20:41:33] <lbracher> Hello! I would like to have a suggestion for a problem I'm facing: I have 2 containers, one runs a Flask API and other runs a VueJS frontend. On my computer, VueJS asks data for API on 0.0.0.0 (hardcoded) and obtains data. The problem is, when I move these 2 containers to another machine, VueJS keeps asking data to 0.0.0.0 and I don't get data anymore. Any ideas for solving that?
[20:44:33] <rawtaz> lbracher: something being directed to connect to 0.0.0.0 sounds incredibly wrong
[20:44:58] <rawtaz> lbracher: your vue should connect to the api on one and the correct IP/hostname
[20:45:31] <lbracher> rawtaz, ok, I'll pass it by a an envvar. Thanks!
[20:45:45] <rawtaz> sure np
[20:46:00] <rawtaz> i mean, it shouldnt have even been able to work if it tried to connect to 0.0.0.0 IMO

[20:54:17] <programmerq> yeah, 0.0.0.0 isn't something you connect to. It's known as the "any address". So if something is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0, that just means that it is listening on all interfaces. This is usually exactly what you want since you don't know the specific container ip ahead of time.
[20:54:55] <programmerq> so if your flask api is running in a container called "flask" and the other container is connected to the same user-defined docker network, it can just connect to "flask" and it will resolve thanks to the docker container service discovery stuff.

[21:10:24] *** Joins: vidbina (~vid@dynamic-077-011-109-222.77.11.pool.telefonica.de)
[21:10:44] <programmerq> There's just a ton of README.md files in the docker official library docs repo. https://github.com/docker-library/docs/
[21:11:41] <programmerq> you can swipe both the template snippets and the generated result and use any of those as a starting point
[21:13:44] <bn_work> ah, ok, yeah, it seems many of them link to the source GH that has the README.md, thanks
[21:15:21] <programmerq> there have occasionally been minor differences in the markdown rendering that docker hub does compared to github's markdown flavor. I seem to recall that hub did switch to gfmd several years back, but it also looks like tianon has a script in that docs repo to lint, which should help you find any issues.
[21:17:06] <tianon> my approach to linting is just to markdownfmt and hope for the best O:)

[21:56:54] <rawtaz> noex: please be more specific - what exactly do you need to do?
[21:57:22] <rawtaz> its very common that you "extend" Dockerfiles, e.g. have Dockerfile A that contains some stuff, then Dockerfile B that uses FROM A and also adds some of its own stuff
[21:57:25] <rawtaz> thats the general answer i suppose
[21:57:42] <rawtaz> you can also do multistage builds, where you have multiple FROMs in the same Dockerfile
[21:57:44] <noex> i have properties in several dockerfiles that set environment variables. i want to set the same variables in all of the images.
[21:58:29] <noex> the images are rhel6, rhel8, win10, etc
[21:58:30] <rawtaz> can you show one of the lines that sets such an env var?
[21:58:36] <rawtaz> or a couple

[22:01:18] <noex> ...

[22:06:32] <rawtaz> and i suppose you mean that you cant make a base Dockerfile that all the others extend from?
[22:06:36] <noex> tabakhase: i follow that part. but after the common file is run, how would i continue on to the parts taht make them unique?

[22:07:25] <noex> rawtaz: sorry, I read that as "base image" for some reason.
[22:08:40] <noex> the build arg makes sense for the common properties, but then they would have to continue on to the parts that make them different (installed packages, etc). i guess it could be scripted.
[22:08:54] <noex> use the same build arg to run a dockerfile with the same name maybe?
[22:09:09] <tabakhase> noex with there own builds then - like id expect a "Dockerfile.env" and a "Dockerfile.rel6" - then have your buildjob be "docker build -t my:rel6-base -f Dockerfile.env --build-arg UPSTREAM=rel6 . && docker build -t my:rel6 -f Dockerfile.rel6 ." or such
