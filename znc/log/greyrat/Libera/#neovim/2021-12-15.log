[11:27:33] <DerpGusta> Hey there. I got my head twisted with lua right now. I am in the process of writing a which-key mapping in another plugin's config file. How would I call require() in that file so that I could add another binding?

[20:54:13] <clason[m]> what does that have to do with LSP?
[20:54:14] <mjlbach[m]> what?
[20:54:15] <kylo252[m]> oh I guess it could just be about the feature not being there -> too old
[20:55:26] <mjlbach[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/17434b88b4892218386b49b400e7eb6d265000ff/runtime/autoload/provider/node.vim#L8
[20:55:31] <mjlbach[m]> it's literally just checking the node version
[20:55:48] <mjlbach[m]> so yes, it is obviously possible to check the global node version
[20:55:59] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: I was secretly hoping we can bump the global requirement, and anyone that uses LSP, probably uses the node host at least for something. but I guess it's a bit of a stretch 
[20:56:17] <clason[m]> there is no global requirement
[20:56:25] <clason[m]> you can use Neovim just fine without ever having seen a Node from a distance.
[20:56:29] <clason[m]> and it needs to stay that way.
[20:56:52] <kylo252[m]> if you were to have a provider*
[20:57:06] <kylo252[m]> there's a min version as indicated by that checkhealth
[20:57:59] <kylo252[m]> geez, it's way too low that it's hopeless to even consider bumping it this high
[20:59:36] <kylo252[m]> so back to just concerning ourselves with lspconfig, any ideas how we should detect node servers? how about parsing the doc string?
[21:00:07] <kylo252[m]> I don't feel like adding lspinfo manually to 40 servers either
[21:00:07] <mjlbach[m]> that sounds hacky AF
[21:00:43] <kylo252[m]> can we not just issue a warning instead of an error? if the node version is too low?
[21:01:59] *** Quits: amichaelc (~amichaelc@user/amichaelc) (Quit: amichaelc)
[21:02:14] <kylo252[m]> or we can add the once controversial `is_node_server` marker, probably by just adding `package_json` to the missing ones, even if it's an empty value
[21:03:19] <mjlbach[m]> package_json is not indiciative of it being a node server
[21:03:25] <mjlbach[m]> s/not/_not_/, s/indiciative/indicative/
[21:04:21] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: I know, but the alternative is actually adding the meta-data tag
[21:04:57] <mjlbach[m]> The alternative is adding a per server lspinfo hook like I suggested :) And it's not an alternative, it's the only option.

[21:11:18] <kylo252[m]> oh well, I'll just shelve it for now. let me know if you think if it should be implemented one way or another

[21:47:19] <kylo252[m]> is it possible to relax the `root_pattern` requirement for `hls` to be just any directory?
[21:48:12] <kylo252[m]> it's tripping a lot of people, and it's probably one of the few ones that doesn't like `.git` or single-files

[22:36:31] <monkoosemonkoose> I continue some series of dumb question about treesitter:
[22:36:31] <monkoosemonkoose> my next one is - `vim.treesitter.get_parser():parse()` returns table of trees, but i in my tests I always only got table of 1 tree. Can someone explain in which situation there can be more?
[22:36:47] <clason[m]> injections
[22:37:10] <monkoosemonkoose> @clason:matrix.org so i need some injection parsers to test it?
[22:37:13] <monkoosemonkoose> right?
[22:37:18] <clason[m]> I think so, yes.
[22:37:43] <monkoosemonkoose> But do main tree is always with index 1? Do you know it?
[22:37:45] <clason[m]> The comment parser should be an easy choice; or lua with `vim.cmd` injections
[22:39:27] <clason[m]> I do not; I'd recommend asking such technical questions at #nvim-treesitter:matrix.org
