[00:00:18] <Noisytoot> It's quite annoying to be pinged whenever I join a channel
[00:00:27] <vitali64[m]> Ah?
[00:00:38] <vitali64[m]> Kaio Duarte: yes
[00:01:00] <kompowiec2> good that irc don't have @everyone ping with discord heh
[00:01:13] <ggoes> lol yeah
[00:01:16] <Noisytoot> Most likely I won't be manually joining this channel, but my bouncer will autojoin it on reconnecting

[00:03:05] <vitali64> aaaaand irc now works!
[00:03:12] <vitali64> wow
[00:03:20] <ggoes> historically we haven't allowed bots in #fsf. fsdbot is something of an exception, but all fsdbot is doing is making sure craigt doesn't have to type as much as he normally would
[00:03:27] <vitali64> the bot makes my irc connection very unstable for some reason
[00:03:35] <vitali64> ggoes: ok
[00:03:47] <vitali64> well
[00:03:51] <ggoes> bots are neat, though, don't get me wrong. just probably not for here unless it's satisfying a need
[00:04:02] <vitali64> if you want the bot to leave, you can say it to leave
[00:04:11] <Kaiod> Hello [username_here], welcome to the official IRC home of the Free Software Foundation. Here, you can interact with free software activists from all over the world! Have questions? Feel free to ask! 
[00:04:17] <vitali64> (~part while being op)
[00:04:22] <Noisytoot> ggoes: There's also fsbot
[00:04:39] <ggoes> right
[00:04:45] <vitali64> Kaiod: way too much text
[00:04:52] <Kaiod> I don't know if it was the coolest thing to be writing welcome, but I think something welcoming gets people's attention!
[00:05:20] <vitali64> maybe i'll have a parameter to change the text
[00:05:25] <vitali64> MAYBE
[00:05:40] <vitali64> also
[00:05:50] <vitali64> I don't think i'll publish the source code now
[00:05:55] <vitali64> even if it is finished
[00:06:00] <vitali64> because ...
[00:06:05] <vitali64> i'm setting up a brand new server
[00:06:07] <Noisytoot> vitali64: Proprietary
[00:06:20] <vitali64> which includes pleroma, xmpp, git, website, ...
[00:06:31] <Kaiod> ggoes: Ggoes, couldn't an exception be made? It is a project that can be developed by the community, and can be very useful!  
[00:06:32] <vitali64> and when i'll finish it, that's where the src will be
[00:06:42] <vitali64> actually
[00:06:44] <ggoes> i worry that most people would find it annoying
[00:07:01] <vitali64> ggoes: you know what?
[00:07:04] <Noisytoot> vitali64: How difficult is it to use cp to copy the source code?
[00:07:07] <vitali64> you gave me an idea?
[00:07:17] <vitali64> Noisytoot: 2/10 difficult

[00:07:33] <vitali64> the code is very simple
[00:07:35] <Kaiod> ggoes: We can adapt it so it's not annoying! I think it's interesting that we can collect the comments and make it really cool!
[00:07:54] <Noisytoot> Kaiod: Not if vitali64 keeps it proprietary
[00:07:56] <vitali64> and made for people to add their own commands and such

[00:08:15] <Noisytoot> vitali64: You should definitely copy it somewhere anyway, what if your server's drive fails?
[00:08:26] <vitali64> it's a raspberrypi
[00:08:31] <vitali64> it doesn't have a disk drive
[00:08:41] <Kaiod> Noisytoot: I am a suspect to speak, as I like new things, but I think a community robot is something that can be put to good use. But it can't be proprietary
[00:08:55] <vitali64> I won't keep it non-libre
[00:08:57] <vitali64> trust me
[00:09:00] <vitali64> ok
[00:09:06] <Noisytoot> vitali64: It has an SD card, it can still fail
[00:09:13] <vitali64> i'll publish it temporarily to Notabug

[00:09:30] *** Joins: Meli (~meli@user/meli)
[00:09:54] <Noisytoot> Kaiod: That depends on what exactly it does, greeting everyone who joins is annoying, and we already have fsbot and fsdbot. fsbot can execute Emacs Lisp which can be used to add new commands
[00:10:26] <Kaiod> Also, we have to respect the Free Software philosophy, after all, this channel belongs to the Free Software Foundation. I believe it should be open, for everyone to collaborate with its code and functionality
[00:10:39] <vitali64> Kaiod: it WILLÂ be open :D

[00:10:39] <fsbot> 2  ..(integer)
[00:10:53] <vitali64> I don't like non-libre software as much as you do
[00:11:32] <Noisytoot> Kaiod: Does that mean we should start allowing anyone to run their own bot? Is there something we want to be done by a bot that fsdbot and fsbot don't already do?
[00:11:57] <vitali64> fsbot: 
[00:11:58] <fsbot> To invoke fsbot, type fsbot: <command> or , <command>
[00:12:06] <Noisytoot> Currently its only feature is greeting everyone, which is quite annoying
[00:12:44] <vitali64> Noisytoot: you're talking about my bot?
[00:12:56] <vitali64> it doesn't only greet everyone
[00:13:13] <Kaiod> Noisytoot: We should allow whatever is good for the community, if there is a robot that is useful and free, besides having functions that a separate robot can provide, that are useful to the community, why not even encourage its creation? 
[00:13:35] <Noisytoot> Kaiod: Yes, but currently vitali64's bot doesn't do anything useful
[00:13:58] <vitali64> I'm adding some useful things
[00:14:04] <Kaiod> We clearly cannot allow anything to be placed here. But I think, at the very least, we can give someone the chance to develop a project and propose something new and useful
[00:15:06] <Kaiod> Noisytoot: I understood that he is still developing it, as far as I read, so I assumed he would collect suggestions and comments
[00:15:25] <vitali64> how did you know my pronouns lol
[00:15:27] <Noisytoot> Kaiod: Until it does something useful for #fsf, it's best to develop it in another channel
[00:16:14] <vitali64> ##chaos ;)
[00:16:44] <Kaiod> vitali64: I have not met, do not speak the same language as you, so interpret any gender as neutral. I think in English, you don't have gender neutral
[00:16:55] <vitali64> Kaiod: i mean
[00:17:00] <vitali64> my pronouns are he/him
[00:17:06] <vitali64> but how did you know them XD
[00:17:12] <vitali64> I never told you XD
[00:18:05] <Kaiod> Noisytoot: Of course, it may even be better for him, who sees that it is not yet the time to make the code fully available and free-licensed
[00:19:01] <Kaiod> vitali64: I used the rules of the Portuguese language, it is more common to say "O vitali" than "A vitali".
[00:19:28] <Kaiod> O = Male Gender, A = Female Gender

[06:47:32] <DiffieHellman> 3>"open source" Cringe - this is the free software foundation
[06:48:38] <DiffieHellman> The GPLv3 and Apache 2.0 free software licenses kind of deal with the patent issue, as if you release code covered by software patents, you have to give the software patent to everyone under the license.
[06:48:43] <\> s/open-source/permissive/
[06:48:46] <\> :)
[06:48:57] <DiffieHellman> So you can't add your patent to the software and then sue people for using it under the GPLv3
[06:50:01] <DiffieHellman> Most permissive licenses don't generally deal with software patents, so the issue is there usually.
[06:51:11] <fossdev2> so This is why i see a post on web that we already violating many software patent without even knowing it.

[07:15:16] <qrpnxz> DiffieHellman, it's actually better not to look at patents. Penalties for knowingly breaking a patent much worse.

[07:16:53] <DiffieHellman> qrpnxz: Yes, as I pointed out.
[07:17:43] <fossdev2> Is trademark grant not that important because most license don't give trademarks grant
[07:17:53] <qrpnxz> did you point it out more than 2 hours ago
[07:17:55] <qrpnxz> because i don't see it
[07:17:56] <qrpnxz> but ok
[07:18:22] <DiffieHellman> Trademark grants aren't important, as you can quite trivially just use another name. Trademarks are specific, so you can even say <original name>-ng
[07:18:41] <qrpnxz> fossdev2, some trademarks can be a real problem for modification. Firefox gives special treatment to distros for trademark i think (or did) before that it was hard work to create "ice weasel"
[07:18:50] <qrpnxz> cargo package manager i hear is also a big trademark problem
[07:19:03] <qrpnxz> not so trivial mate, not for some software

[07:20:01] <qrpnxz> i def rather use rust than c++, so it's not that bad
[07:20:10] <qrpnxz> i also prefer it to java
[07:20:17] <DiffieHellman> Just use a real language like C.
[07:20:28] <qrpnxz> they are not replacements for each other
[07:20:37] <fossdev2> i only use C programs
[07:20:38] <qrpnxz> well, i suppose rust can replace c
[07:20:42] <qrpnxz> but not the other way around
[07:21:01] <DiffieHellman> Rust is reliant on a sepples compiler, which is kind of reliant on C, so not really.

[10:39:14] <Maximalist> such as?
[10:42:32] <vertbyqb[m]> it contains nonfree software in the repositories and offers nonfree software installed during installation. both of those can be avoided, but Trisquel might be an easier option. see also https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html#Ubuntu
