[03:46:19] <mawk> the hinting is done per glyph though deniska no?
[03:47:17] <deniska> hinting is per-glyph, not sure how applicable hinting is if you render b&w no grayscale though
[03:47:19] <mawk> only the kerning wouldn't be done if I generate glyph by glyph
[03:47:19] <mawk> and I can probably store kerning info and do that myself in code, it can't be too hard
[03:47:19] <mawk> for 26 characters that's 325 different pairs of letters, I can store the offsets for each pair easily 
[03:47:28] <mawk> it's a color screen

[07:30:23] <vdamewood> You're not stating which property of global variables you're using them for.
[07:31:12] <Izem> a small database for other parts of the program to keep track of stuff (state)
[07:31:35] <vdamewood> A global object. An object that gets passed around in every relivent call.

[08:46:12] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: So, you have a string, and because you're using a type cast (or attempting to do so), you're basically saying: "Yeah yeah, you think it's a string. Whatever. But it's actually a double".
[08:46:32] <[itchyjunk]> yes, because it is. the stupid computer doesn't know better

[14:06:02] * pyzozord palms his face
[14:06:11] <arahael> vdamewood: You can't use a COM library via well, COM, if you're writing a .NET app and the library just happens to be written in .NET as well - which is a problem if the library was originally COM, adn then updated themselves to .NET.

[14:15:09] <arahael> Samian: Not fear mongering.  I considered Qt at work.  Their license situation was not workable.
[14:15:26] <Samian> Tesla uses Qt. Mercedes Benz is now using Qt
[14:15:29] <arahael> Samian: Also, they required that all devs who would work on that project have a license from the get-go.
[14:15:32] <deniska> Samian: giving a total impression of a fully commercial product, unless you already know that lgpl is an option
[14:15:44] <vdamewood> Samian: And they're rich enough to afford it, too.
[14:15:55] <deniska> (and even while somewhat liberal, lgpl isn't suitable for everyone)
[14:16:00] <Samian> arahael  their license gets complicated only if you alter their source code
[14:16:15] <arahael> Samian: They asked for $6k per dev. Per annum.
[14:16:19] <Samian> arahael  and only if you make custom controls 
[14:16:22] <vdamewood> Samian: No, it's complicated even if you don't in some cases.
[14:16:46] <vdamewood> For example, if you need to use a distribution model that requires that users be unable to modify the components of your app.
[14:16:49] <Samian> arahael  as long as you keep the Qt dll separate from your program, and you haven't altered Qt, you're fine
[14:16:52] <deniska> They also require you to register to download prebuilt libraries and tools

[14:18:33] <vdamewood> Samian: So, you're not as familiar with different coding situations as you seem to think you are, then.
[14:18:37] <deniska> While both these platforms support dynamic linking, LGPL also requires libraries to be user replaceable
[14:18:47] <arahael> ^^ That.
[14:19:00] <Samian> does using qt for an android program necessary mean that qt can't be a separate file?
[14:19:01] <arahael> The dynamic linking itself is irrelevant, really - a means to an end.
[14:19:35] <deniska> yeah, you may also provide an object file to link, LGPL doesn't require a specific way of replacebility
[14:19:40] <vdamewood> Samian: Interesting that you narrow it down to android when iOS and android were brought up.
[14:20:13] <Samian> vdamewood I was going to ask the same for ios
[14:20:32] <deniska> It's the same situation on both android and iOS, user is not allowed to go inside application directories and change files
[14:20:40] <vdamewood> Samian: For a long time, the iOS app store didn't allow dynamic linking, and it still might now.
[14:20:49] <deniska> You can provide the way to rebuild your application for each respective platform
[14:20:51] <Samian> All I know is getting c sharp to work with cpp requires a bunch of crap glue code.
[14:21:10] <jinsun> Qt vs .Net is apples ot oranges isn't it, .Net provides a lot of stuff other than just GUI, and you get to use much better languages than C++
[14:21:15] <Samian> vdamewood  well apple lost a lawsuit
[14:21:17] <vdamewood> Samian: the same could be said of any language and C++.
[14:21:19] <Samian> vdamewood  a big lawsuit
[14:21:28] <vdamewood> Samian: Did it affect this rule?
[14:21:54] <Samian> vdamewood  ehh Qt works great with c++.     XAML Uis with cpp backend is an effing nightmare
[14:22:22] <deniska> if your target language is C++, Qt is a fairly nice option, comparatively speaking
[14:22:23] <Samian> with a managed cpp glue code layer
[14:22:28] <deniska> especially if you can comply with LGPL :)
[14:22:42] <Samian> managed cpp, an entire language dedicated to glue code
[14:22:58] <deniska> but between C++ and C# for your average GUI application, I'd pick C#
[14:23:05] <Samian> How the heck can the glue code be so overbloated that they need to make a new language just for the glue code!

[14:26:43] <vdamewood> Personally, I'm fine with the Qt license situation. If you don't save $6000k/yr/developer, then it's not worth it.
[14:26:45] <Samian> the way everyone takes ideas from everyone else, gtk should just rip qt
[14:27:00] <vdamewood> GTK has the same legal problem.
[14:27:22] <arahael> vdamewood: Yeah, the tricky thing is, though - there are alternatives to Qt.
[14:27:34] <deniska> another problem with GPL is that people developing it are deeply uninterested in any usecase for GTK besides writing Gnome in it

[14:51:41] <arahael> Samian: Last time I tried that, I was told I have no friends.
[14:51:52] <Samian> sheesh
[14:51:53] <[itchyjunk]> i need to traverse through a tree like file
[14:52:08] <[itchyjunk]> i need to add things and check if it checks out with some given total
[14:52:14] <[itchyjunk]> and can be infinitely nested
[14:52:33] <arahael> Samian: Funnily enough, I have seen recently "Alex has added to his story. Read it before it goes away!", but...  I'm a firm believer that such things will still be there later.
[14:52:33] <vdamewood> Samian: For some reason, Facebook likes to show me friends of friends when our mutual friend and I have no mutual friends, and we live on the other side of the planet.

[14:53:04] <arahael> Samian: I'm quite happy to specifically tell Facebook which topics I would like to see adverts about.
[14:53:08] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: what is the function calculating?
[14:53:18] <arahael> Samian: But generally, facebook prefers to tell me things I've already seen.
[14:53:19] <Samian> we're working on it
[14:53:37] <[itchyjunk]> function is calculating the sum of entries
[14:53:47] <Samian> arahael  it's a difficult part of AI because of "sparse features"
[14:53:48] <[itchyjunk]> but an entry can itself be this same structure
[14:53:53] <[itchyjunk]> so it will want to recurse
[14:54:01] <arahael> Samian: I'm also the type of user who, once I see an advert, I immediately stop watching the video (in the vast majority of cases).
[14:54:18] <GeDaMo> so it's sum(this) + sum(children)?
[14:54:45] <PlanckWalk> The time before last when I used Facebook, I played one of those online games, where they suggest a hundred friends to give you stuff in game.  Last time I used Facebook, they asked me to identify people in photos, or lose access to my account.
[14:54:53] <arahael> Samian: Twitter, by contrast, gives far, far more relevant adverts in my experience.
[14:54:56] <PlanckWalk> So I lost access to my account.
[14:55:01] <[itchyjunk]> `next 4 entry has a total of 5` - entry 1 entry 2 entry `next 2 entry has total of 1` - child entry 1 - child entry 2 - 4 entry
[14:55:04] <arahael> (But I curate my twitter feed more carefully)
[14:55:26] <vdamewood> PlanckWalk: All of my friends are Donald Duck.
[14:55:32] <arahael> PlanckWalk: Oh, yeah. "Who is this person?" [ Shows picture of a tree ]
[14:55:57] <vdamewood> "Who is this person?" shows picture with a person face on a bilboard in the background.
[14:56:19] <arahael> One of my friends is a pokemon, apparently.
[14:56:38] <PlanckWalk> So from my point of view, Facebook actively refused me service.
[14:56:46] <vdamewood> arahael: Are you friends with a bulbasaur?
[14:56:46] <PlanckWalk> SO, screw them.
[14:57:04] <arahael> vdamewood: Possibly.  I don't know - I have a whole bunch of "friends" I know nothign about.
[14:57:14] <vdamewood> arahael: Like me!
[14:57:17] <[itchyjunk]> Facebook asked for a copy of my drivers license.
[14:57:27] <PlanckWalk> WTF, really?
[14:57:27] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Yeah, that's going way too far.
[14:57:33] <[itchyjunk]> Yes.
[14:57:35] <vdamewood> Facebook askedfor a copy of my friend's driver's license too.
[14:57:41] <PlanckWalk> I'm pretty sure that's not even legal in Australia
[14:57:44] <[itchyjunk]> They said they wanted to verify my real name.
[14:57:51] <vdamewood> The reason, for my friend, is because he's legally mononominal.
[14:57:56] <[itchyjunk]> This was a while back. they stopped doing this form what i hear.
[14:58:08] <[itchyjunk]> But apparently they this to "select" people in USA at some point.
[14:58:13] <[itchyjunk]> And a few in EU.
[14:58:17] <[itchyjunk]> And got in trouble in EU.
[14:58:31] <arahael> And there's no reason for it anyway.
[14:58:38] <[itchyjunk]> Remember when they were trying to make FB ID cards?
[14:58:58] <[itchyjunk]> They were trying to make a push to force everyone to use real names.

[16:01:47] <arahael> paule32: Well, yes, but you seek to the start of the file, so you're essentially overwriting what's already in the file.  But my suspicion is that you used to call that code twice, even if you're no-longer doing so.

[16:02:39] <arahael> paule32: I'd also probably revise the methods on the TFileStream class, as the way you're using it is awkward at best.

[16:03:41] <[itchyjunk]> here as in for my class

[16:04:29] <Rounin> You could do:  newResult = oldResult + double2; totalError += (newResult - oldResult - double2);  ... And then at the end, after all the adds, you add in totalError... Not optimal, but it's usable... B ut again, not for money
[16:04:59] <Rounin> So totalError is responsible to hold the small bits that fall off the end during the adds

[16:14:42] <[itchyjunk]> i remember there was some case when some guy had rounding error in his code and all that rounding up errors was added to an account

[16:15:05] <[itchyjunk]> damn, accountants think their math is better!
[16:15:16] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: It's more that their maths is defined legally.
[16:15:49] <Rounin> Not to mention, IEEE maths is made to be as accurate as it can given very heavy constraints, not to be accurate enough
[16:16:00] <Rounin> Though with, say, 128-bit floats, it might actually begin to be sufficient
[16:16:22] <Rounin> 64-bit IEEE floats give 53 bits of integer precision already, which is a lot
[16:16:35] <arahael> Rounin: Do they use banker's rounding, though?
[16:17:17] <Rounin> Not as far as I know... There might be some sort of feature that allows different rounding modes, but who knows
[16:18:38] <PlanckWalk> A double variable can store up to ~10^14 dollars to the nearest cent
[16:18:49] <PlanckWalk> But the arithmetic, eww.  Just no.
[16:19:03] <Rounin> Right... You still have the issue of adding floats with different magnitudes etc.
[16:20:29] <PlanckWalk> Yep.  And if you want add 0.001327% interest rounded down to the nearest cent, you can't feasibly do that with double.

[17:17:04] <[itchyjunk]> which later ends up being not quite true with more categories

[20:15:09] <pyzozord> I should probably take it to ##math
[20:15:21] <mawk> so it's quite easy to figure out what the 345th term is
[20:15:45] <Izem> I guess that is zero instead of one?
[20:15:46] <spynxic> Is that something that modulo operator would be used for

[20:17:58] <mawk> if you want yes, but integrals are more than averages
[20:18:21] <spynxic> They are better fit averages for changing data?
[20:18:27] <mawk> yes Izem if you stick several of them together it's not hard to make a bigger register and just do the carry when it happens

[20:23:05] <mawk> 2^(n+1) does [2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, ...], so in 2^(344+1) n = 344, and 344 = 0 mod 4

[20:25:02] <mawk> and for base 11 the last digit is 10
[20:25:13] <mawk> or whatever symbol you assign to 9+1 in base 11
[20:25:22] <Izem> I don't know base 11 :/
[20:25:36] <mawk> it's the same kind of trick
[20:25:41] <Izem> I know
[20:25:42] <mawk> the last digit repeats with a period 10
[20:26:04] <mawk> so 345 mod 10 = 5, so last digit is the same as that of 2^5 mod 11 = 10

[23:04:05] <nitrix> It's not statically typed, but it's still pretty good. Type checking is a trivial exercise in logic programming; it's entirely unification and constraint solving.

[23:10:33] <CoderGuy> Question  module.exports = themodule;   versus module.exports = {themodule};  how come in the first version if I do const myvar = require(thefilethatexports); it's totally fine but in the second version, it fails?
[23:10:56] <CoderGuy> even if I do const {myvar} = require(thefilethatexports);
[23:11:19] <CoderGuy> BUTTTT if I do const {themodule} = require(thefilethatexports); now it works...
[23:11:44] <CoderGuy> but in the original example, somehow it just assigned const myvar = require(thefilethatexports); somehow this version works

[23:14:57] <GeDaMo> In what way does it fail?
[23:16:49] <CoderGuy> umm in the way that in the original example it somehow just assigns const myvar to the exported variable, but originally the exported variable is themodule
[23:17:07] <CoderGuy> but when putting curly brackets { themodule }  now it has to match
[23:17:18] <GeDaMo> Doesn't that create a dictionary?
[23:17:31] <CoderGuy> I guess but without the dictionary why does it not care?
[23:17:54] <GeDaMo> It looks like module.exports is expected to be an object
[23:18:03] *** Quits: Powerhouse6666 (~Powerhous@security.orcacomputers.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:18:21] <CoderGuy> so what does this mean than? const { varhere } = require(thefile);
[23:18:33] <CoderGuy> does that mean like "lookup and match it?" 
[23:18:40] <GeDaMo> I don't know
[23:19:05] <CoderGuy> but then const varhere = require(thefile); does that just assign to whatever object is exported hmm
[23:19:13] *** Joins: johan (~johan@user/johan)
[23:19:46] <CoderGuy> well in any event I just decided to properly name the exported object, which I thought meant I had to change everything but then I found out you can do module.exports = { varyouwant:originalvar}

[23:20:39] <CoderGuy> although I guess based on how I decide to export I leave the option of assigning with a custom name or without one
[23:20:44] <user51> GeDaMo: know any j?
[23:20:59] <GeDaMo> Very little
[23:21:08] <CoderGuy> cuz const {anyvaryouwant} is not gonna work
[23:21:17] <user51> bummer. seems like an interesting language.
[23:21:19] <CoderGuy> but const anyvaryouwant that will work..so curly brackets remove that option
