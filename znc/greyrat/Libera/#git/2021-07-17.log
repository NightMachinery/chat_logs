[03:37:25] <DvdKhl> The best idea I currently have to "solve" the issue is listing all commits in a post-receive hook query the db to identify new commits. Get additional info via git show for the new commits and then store that information in the table. But that is kind of ridiculous.

[17:04:19] <rossy_> BtbN, ty.  I'm the only person working on my project.  The branch I'm working in is where I want my project to be.  When I checkout my main it tells me that it is 3 commits ahead of origin/main. when I merge my branch into the main branch it seems to work, but when git won't let me push it because the remote contains work I don't have locally.

[19:11:11] <tempate> as far as I know my repo only has one git repository, the main one
[19:11:48] <ikke> When you clone a repository, git creates a remote called 'origin' by default

[19:12:28] <cbreak> tempate: didn't you say you had a repository on github?
[19:12:28] <ikke> So when you do `git push origin`, it's short for git push <url/to/remote>
[19:12:37] <tempate> I did, yes
[19:12:41] <cbreak> tempate: and you obviously have an other repository on your computer
[19:12:45] <cbreak> since you admitted you cloned it
[19:12:58] <cbreak> so there are at least two repos
[19:12:58] <tempate> I thought those were the same
[19:13:01] <cbreak> no
[19:13:02] <tempate> since, as you said, I cloned it
[19:13:05] <cbreak> they are not even on the same computer
[19:13:09] <cbreak> how can they be the same?
[19:13:32] <tempate> the number 1 is the same regardless of how many computers it is in

[19:14:40] <cbreak> cloning gives you a copy of a repository
[19:14:44] <cbreak> a _distinct_ copy
[19:14:56] <tempate> ikke: alright
[19:15:04] <ikke> Then you create a new branch
[19:15:05] <cbreak> what ever you do with it remains in that repository, unless you explicitly copy that information somewhere else
[19:15:13] <cbreak> pushing is such a way to copy information somewhere else

[19:15:59] <tempate> so what does origin mean?
[19:16:07] <cbreak> tempate: a piece of paper can contain information. But two pieces of paper that contain the same information are NOT the same piece of paper
[19:16:12] <ikke> origin is the default remote name that git creates
[19:16:17] <cbreak> origin is just a default name for the repository you clone from
[19:16:21] <ikke> just like `master` for now is the default branch name
[19:16:46] <tempate> ok, got it!
[19:16:52] <cbreak> you created new history in your local "piece of paper"
[19:17:03] <cbreak> and now with git push you want to write the same information to the "origin" piece of paper
[19:17:16] <cbreak> but git push doens't know that by default
[19:17:28] <cbreak> so you have to set up where pushing should write information first
[19:17:48] <tempate> so when I "git push --set-upstream origin my-local-branch" I just tell git to create the same branch I have in my local repository in the repository from which I cloned my local from
[19:17:51] <tempate> is that correct?
[19:18:15] <ikke> tempate: git push origin my-local-branch already does that
[19:18:37] *** Quits: gnoo (~gnoo@user/gnoo) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[19:18:42] <ikke> with --set-upstream, you also tell git to remember that these branches correspond
[19:19:20] <cbreak> -u means "remember where I push to for the future"
[19:19:28] <ikke> it just adds some settings in .git/config
[19:19:54] <cbreak> origin is the name of the remote repository
[19:20:10] <cbreak> you could use an url there too, if you don't want to configure this... but I'm not sure if that's compatible with -u
[19:20:19] <ikke> afaik no
[19:20:31] <cbreak> and the target refspec can be different too
[19:20:35] <cbreak> HEAD means "current branch"
[19:20:48] <cbreak> some-branch-name means "use that name for local and remote branch
[19:21:03] <cbreak> src:dst means push branch src on local machine to branch dst on remote
