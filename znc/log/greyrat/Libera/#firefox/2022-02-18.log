[00:02:29] <Caspy7[m]> panella32: fyi you can do shift+right click and select "Take snapshot..." to save a pic from the video
[00:02:51] <Caspy7[m]> also, maybe you could find a userstyle that gets what you want https://userstyles.org/styles/browse/youtube
[00:03:18] <Caspy7[m]> they'll push the Stylish Addon, but instead install Stylus to install them
[00:03:40] <Caspy7[m]> Stylish got sold to folks looking to siphon up your history

[00:09:40] <panella32> pyzozord Thanks I will check it out!

[00:14:51] <susi> https://0x0.st/o84G.txt is this just normal firefox :(
[00:15:17] <susi> just normal segfaulting every now and then
[00:15:18] <Caspy7[m]> (Stylus is a fork of Stylish before it got bought and had the bad code put in)
[00:15:45] <Caspy7[m]> susi: is about:crashes available to you?
[00:16:56] <susi> nope
[00:17:04] <susi> >This application has not been configured to display crash reports. The preference breakpad.reportURL must be set.
[00:17:27] <susi> the browser itself does not crash
[00:18:10] <Caspy7[m]> susi: sounds like you've got a distro build then without crash symbols. mozilla.org builds and...Ubuntu? I forget, one or more distros may have symbols
[00:19:06] <Caspy7[m]> you can report it to your distro I suppose
[00:20:41] <susi> Arch is getting packages with debug symbols, but I'm happy with my Firefox as it is
[00:21:32] <susi> you wouldn't notice those segfaults other but following your dmesg
[00:22:17] <Caspy7[m]> alright, sounds like there's no issue
[00:22:30] <susi> not sure if there is
[00:23:02] <susi> most of those segfaults seem to happen in libxul.so :O
[00:24:14] <susi> what's your breakpad.reportURL value?
[00:24:25] <susi> I have it set empty

[15:07:04] <Masklin_Gurder> Uh, seems like somehow firefox got uninstalled... ?
[15:07:15] <Masklin_Gurder> I did dnf install firefox and now it starts. Extremely strange.
[15:07:20] <Masklin_Gurder> I'm the only admin...
[15:31:29] <Cork> Masklin_Gurder: the error means that when the kernel tries to load the module the elf data it got wasn't of a type it could load
[15:31:48] <Cork> probably cause the lib had been removed or something (based on what you said later)
[15:38:35] <Masklin_Gurder> I see
[15:38:48] <Masklin_Gurder> Thank you Cork. Still not sure how those files were removed...
[15:38:57] <Masklin_Gurder> Maybe a botched bash command at some point I don't remember
[15:38:58] <Cork> Masklin_Gurder: what distro?

[18:52:23] <bmomjian1> I am using firefox 97.0 on Ubuntu 20.04.   I am getting "Access Denied You don't have permission to access http://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/" but it works in Chrome.  I have tried clearing cookies and cache, turning off enhanced tracking protection, turning off uBlock-origin, and a private browser window.  Any ideas on what else I should try?
[18:52:46] <Caspy7[m]> panella32: perhaps you intended this for another channel
[18:54:36] <Caspy7[m]> bmomjian1: does it work in a private window?
[18:55:07] <panella32>  Caspy7[m] yes but was also curious to know if guys here have any idea. Maybe it's easier to extract url of Firefox's Downloads page. It'd be fine, either chrome or firefox.
[18:56:17] <bmomjian1> I did "New private window" and mentioned that.  Are you asking for something else?
[18:57:03] <bmomjian1> I went into the debugging tools and the Network console shows 403 for everything.
[18:57:06] <Caspy7[m]> bmomjian1: apologies, I missed that when reading
[18:57:13] <bmomjian1> NP. It was a long list.  ;-)
[18:57:26] <bmomjian1> Firefox does work on my tablet.
[18:58:32] <Caspy7[m]> gotta run for a few min, but the "forget" option from history may resolve it. It clears *all* data associated w/ the domain including passwords
[18:58:33] <bmomjian1> I tried it on another Ubuntu Firefox and got the same error.  So Chrome works and firefox on tablet works, all from the same IP, so it can't be an IP block.
[19:00:00] <bmomjian1> Oh, I thought the clear from settings was the same but I see history has more options so  I will try that now.
[19:01:07] <bmomjian1> Ugh, same error after clearing everything.

[20:07:01] <erlehmann> i have a problem, how to communicate with mozilla about low RAM bugs now that they use matrix?
[20:07:13] <Caspy7[m]> susi: this is essentially trying to prepare *others* by reporting problems before the actual 100 releases
[20:07:33] <erlehmann> riot and every other matrix client i have tried lag my entire computer and need about 1G of ram each
[20:07:36] <Caspy7[m]> erlehmann: bugzilla.mozilla.org
[20:07:44] <erlehmann> i have like 2g of RAM
[20:07:45] <erlehmann> ah ok
[20:07:57] <erlehmann> so no way to chat with ppl? or is there some way to connect to their matrix via irc?
[20:08:12] <Caspy7[m]> erlehmann: have you tried Element in the browser?
[20:08:16] <erlehmann> i mean i would use matrix if it would actually *work*
[20:08:29] <Caspy7[m]> that is, the web client
[20:09:21] <Caspy7[m]> it's the default used at chat.mozilla.org
[20:09:29] <erlehmann> Caspy7[m] it is similarly bad. as of my understanding, the matrix protocol is some kind of eventually consistent state replication architecture on which someone bolted a chat system as a proof-of-concept.
[20:10:09] <erlehmann> and it needs a lot of requests and state maintenance on the client compared to … well, everything else i know.
[20:10:16] <erlehmann> so there is probably no way to actually implement a lightweight client.
[20:10:55] <erlehmann> the only thing i have seen that is worse was discord, where the sign-up page (in the browser) somehow managed to lag my computer worse than any 3d game i played. well.
[20:10:57] <Caspy7[m]> erlehmann: weechat
[20:11:20] <erlehmann> uh, wouldn't weechat also have to do like 2 connections for each person in a chatroom?
[20:11:28] <erlehmann> i mean 2 requests
[20:11:33] <erlehmann> one for the profile data, one for the avatar.
[20:11:38] <erlehmann> ok i guess it skips the avatar
[20:11:58] <Caspy7[m]> I dunno, it's text only, doesn't support a lot of what matrix does so figured it's probably lighter than most others
[20:12:02] <erlehmann> but like, in this room are 275 people. any app would lag if it would make that many requests at the same time.
[20:13:26] <erlehmann> i think you misunderstood me. i investigated the matrix spec and apart from other hilarities (like some examples in the spec not matching the normative text in the same spec a paragraph further) i am convinced simply handling the matrix protocol requires a LOT of resources.
[20:14:02] <erlehmann> it's not like irc or xmpp where everything is neatly streamed to the client
[20:14:19] <erlehmann> if you join a room with 4000 users you'll have more load on both the server and client than in a room with 40.
[20:14:30] <Caspy7[m]> ok, what's your aim in this conversation then?
[20:14:43] <erlehmann> i wanted to know if there is some lightweight way, like an irc-to-matrix gateway
[20:14:58] <erlehmann> libera chat has one for some matrix stuff
[20:15:20] <erlehmann> but i guess i will only post on bugzilla then
[20:15:28] <erlehmann> so thank you for that!
[20:15:53] <erlehmann> if you ever want to be amused, i suggest to read the matrix spec btw
[20:16:12] <Caspy7[m]> dunno, that may exist, maybe someone else here knows, but you may try web searching or finding another libera channel that's on that topic
[20:16:21] <erlehmann> i tried web searching
[20:16:25] <erlehmann> hmm
[20:16:30] <erlehmann> maybe someone here knows about my problem
[20:16:42] <erlehmann> so i have unifont and several times firefox crashes with some bug when it allocates font stuff
[20:16:49] <erlehmann> it must be a recent regression
[20:17:14] <erlehmann> because it has been holding up fine for some while until i installed firefox 97
[20:17:30] <Caspy7[m]> erlehmann: are you seeing crash reports in about:crashes ?
[20:17:42] <erlehmann> yes, lots of them
