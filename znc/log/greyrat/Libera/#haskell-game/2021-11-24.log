[07:29:28] <EvanR> the yak shaving continues. I made two performance counters that complement each other. It looks like this right now 100.0% (0139). The first number is the bogusly derived estimate of the number of frames not missed in the last N frames. The second number is an avg fraction of 16.666ms used by the main loop each frame, per 10000
[07:29:57] <EvanR> when the numbers reach 9999, usually the % drops below 100 and that's a better indicator of how bad I'm doing
[07:31:03] <EvanR> the time measured includes event process and rendering (at least up to the "present" call)
[07:31:11] <EvanR> event processing
[07:31:28] <EvanR> typing or moving the mouse makes the number visibly jump up xD
[07:33:05] <EvanR> also I changed the text display so you issue calls to render glyphs on a texture instead of continually rendering 5000 glyphs even if they did not change
[07:49:14] <sm>  cool EvanR. +1 for solid game perf stats
[07:52:31] <EvanR> actually I just reversed my (0139) stat by doing 10000 minus. So it looks like (9861). Higher numbers better xD
[07:53:03] <EvanR> so now it's like the % is your HP and the numbers in parentheses are your armor/shields xD

[21:34:45] <EvanR> ManofLetters[m], no I just grabbed a bitmap font off github
[21:38:22] <ManofLetters[m]> I mean, is the optimization "you issue calls to render glyphs on a texture instead of continually rendering 5000 glyphs even if they did not change" the one that is called font atlast, or more generally, texture atlas?
[21:38:35] <ManofLetters[m]> or more like double buffering?
[21:38:50] <ManofLetters[m]> do you render a glyph to a texture only once per program run?
[21:39:01] <ManofLetters[m]> and then just lookup this texture and paste it?
[21:39:42] <ManofLetters[m]> the are libraries this optimization make it easier (and faster), but it's easy to do in Haskell as well
[21:40:02] <ManofLetters[m]> s/the are libraries this optimization make it easier (and faster), but it's easy to do in Haskell as well/the are libraries that make this optimization easier (and faster), but it's easy to do in Haskell as well/
[21:42:03] <EvanR> the off screen buffer is used as the console
[21:42:48] <EvanR> So that gets redisplayed each frame. But like putC doesn't happen every frame
[21:43:20] <ManofLetters[m]> what is putC?
[21:43:49] <EvanR> a command to burn a single glyph into the texture
[21:44:25] <EvanR> the font itself is a texture loaded from an image file
[21:44:38] <EvanR> so that's your atlas I guess
[21:45:10] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, ok, yes, it's an atlas, but precomputed, not accumulated during a run
[21:45:23] <ManofLetters[m]> that must be a lot of tiny pictures
[21:46:00] <ManofLetters[m]> do you have it for all foreground and background colours of all characters? and all sizes, if you render glyphs in various sizes?
[21:47:04] <ManofLetters[m]> actually, scratch the last part, if this a bitmap font, you can just scale it brutally
[21:48:47] <ManofLetters[m]> hmm, and I guess, if it's bitmap and so no anti-aliasing, and so monochrome, you can rather easily change colours?
[21:48:50] <ManofLetters[m]> ok, figures
[21:48:55] <EvanR> i haven't solidified the api for it, but in the pile of crap here I can scale it up like 2x or 3x
[21:49:08] <ManofLetters[m]> sure, makes sense
[21:49:21] <ManofLetters[m]> never mind me, with bitmap fonts life is indeed easier
[21:49:21] <EvanR> yeah I change the fg and bg color by detecting the black or white of the texture and doing an if statement in the shader xd
[21:49:32] <ManofLetters[m]> +1
[21:49:35] <f-a> do you prescale it and then blit (so you have 3 spritesheets) or scale each call?
[21:49:56] <EvanR> no point in prescaling since the shader runs every time
[21:50:07] <EvanR> and already has to do those computations to position the glyph
[21:50:51] *** Joins: myShoggoth (~myShoggot@97-120-85-195.ptld.qwest.net)
[21:51:33] <EvanR> you mention scaling, if you really wanted to you could apply a smoothing function when it goes 2x... super eagle or something?
[21:51:38] <EvanR> if you are feeling funky
[21:53:56] <ManofLetters[m]> crisp pixels
[21:54:11] <ManofLetters[m]> but if you scale 1.1 or 1.9 then smoothing would help
[21:54:31] <EvanR> "a pixel is a little square" --ManofLetters xD
[21:54:43] <ManofLetters[m]> because pixels wouldn't be crips anyway and some parts of the font would have randomly different thickness than others
[21:54:50] <ManofLetters[m]> haha
[21:54:59] <EvanR> well this bitmap font is pretty uniform
[21:55:08] <ManofLetters[m]> yeah, I have it yet another way, having transformed the fonts from bitmap to ttf
[21:55:11] <EvanR> and an upscaler can maintain that
[21:55:21] <ManofLetters[m]> at 1.1 or 1.2 scale?
[21:55:25] <ManofLetters[m]> I doubt it
[21:55:25] <EvanR> no 2x 
[21:55:30] <ManofLetters[m]> sure
[21:55:47] <ManofLetters[m]> hence, "but if you scale times 1.1 or 1.9 then smoothing would help"
[21:56:01] <ManofLetters[m]> but otherwise crisp pixels are better
[21:56:08] <ManofLetters[m]> and smoothing would kill them
[21:56:18] <EvanR> warning, not for the faint of heart https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel-art_scaling_algorithms
[21:57:03] <EvanR> eagle, 2xsal, hq3x
[21:57:20] <ManofLetters[m]> I know those names
[21:57:27] <ManofLetters[m]> I think from DosBox from ages ago?
[21:58:12] <EvanR> i remember these from zsnes xD
[21:58:31] <EvanR> I always disabled it and looks at giant squares
[21:58:34] <EvanR> looked*
[21:58:53] <EvanR> *which is ridiculous because that's not even what it looked like on TV* xD
[21:58:59] <ManofLetters[m]> haha
[21:59:03] <ManofLetters[m]> but still
[21:59:10] <ManofLetters[m]> we do it the right way
[21:59:27] <f-a> never appreciated filters tbf
[22:00:07] <EvanR> for arcade, pacman, mario bros, etc, that CRT look is great xD
[22:00:19] <EvanR> old TV though... looks terrible
