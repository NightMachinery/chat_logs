[00:15:52] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: I blame the confusion about that on things like irccloud

[00:16:31] *** Joins: germ (~germ@germ.lanvaux.fr)
[00:16:53] <MetaNova> it's just /there/ for most people, the disconnect in using the software vs knowing how it works grows further
[00:16:56] *** Joins: abff (~abff@user/abff)
[00:17:47] <MetaNova> then again, kids don't know what files and directories are, so we're basically already doomed
[00:17:58] <Khaytsus> MetaNova: Even at that a znc is still not as fancy as an irccloud, no infinite scrollback..  although maybe there are clients that hook in something to do that
[00:18:10] <MetaNova> ( https://news.slashdot.org/story/21/09/27/2032200/students-dont-know-what-files-and-folders-are-professors-say )
[00:19:04] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: backlog and a client smart enough to request more of it depending on where you're looking at in the buffer would be okay, I guess
[00:19:25] <MetaNova> if the dynamic redraw thing would also be seamless
[00:19:33] <MetaNova> (which it won't)
[00:20:09] <Khaytsus> MetaNova: Yeah, it'd be nice to have for sure..  request N more lines, populate them in the right place, etc.  But likely tricky and would be real client specific
[00:20:24] <MetaNova> it comes down to the client, yeah
[00:21:09] <MetaNova> it wouldn't matter how well ZNC handled dynamic scrollback, if the client can't render it, it's pointless
[00:22:29] <MetaNova> heck, hexchat still gets confused if a lot of activity happens in the chat window if another window has (gasp) been placed on top of it for too long
[00:22:40] <lord_daemon> I'm going to install znc on a windows machine that wants to leave it on 24h. the question was if i can see the channel logs when i connect to this znc

[00:23:30] <MetaNova> lord_daemon: assuming ZNC stays connected (and the machine remains running, with a stable internet connection) then your experience should be little different than if ZNC were hosted any other place

[00:24:11] *** Joins: abff (~abff@user/abff)
[00:24:13] <Khaytsus> Yes, depends on your lines per channel, global lines, etc...  a busy channel you probably won't because you won't want thousands of lines being played back
[00:24:43] <MetaNova> buffer playback can be ensured if the default behavior of cache/playback/clear does not operate smoothly for you
[00:24:59] <ROllerozxa> Hi, I've been looking in my .znc folder and saw that I have seemingly two folders with duplicate log files, "~/.znc/users/ROllerozxa/networks/liberachat/moddata/log" and "~/.znc/moddata/log/ROllerozxa/liberachat". It writes new channel logs to both folders. Which one is the "canonical" one and how do I disable the extra one?
[00:25:18] <Khaytsus> ROllerozxa: Only enable logs at ONE level
[00:25:21] <Khaytsus> global, network, or user.
[00:25:24] <Khaytsus> You've done it at multiple.
[00:25:31] <MetaNova> ROllerozxa: https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#What_are_the_different_module_load_levels.3F_.28Global_vs_User_vs_Network.29
[00:25:45] <ROllerozxa> ohh
[00:25:51] <Khaytsus> I've done it too in the past ;)
[00:26:17] <MetaNova> ROllerozxa: ~/.znc/users/ROllerozxa/networks/liberachat/moddata/log are the logs from *log loaded for the network
[00:26:29] <MetaNova> ~/.znc/moddata/log/ROllerozxa/liberachat are the logs from *log loaded for your user
[00:26:55] *** Joins: keir (~keir@user/keir)
[00:26:56] <ROllerozxa> yeah I can see the issue now, I explicitly enabled the log module for liberachat without knowing the global log module was already enabled...
[00:27:03] <ROllerozxa> thanks :)
[00:30:22] <lord_daemon> I intend to configure it for a specific channel that the staff always puts examples of a subject that I like
[00:31:10] <lord_daemon> I can install it on my own machine at first to see how it works
[00:32:34] <Khaytsus> Sure, and it's easy to transfer the config.. just make sure it's the same version and has the same modules etc and it'll just work

[05:23:43] <yang_qwq> hi
[05:23:43] <yang_qwq> does anybody know how to let moz thunderbird support this program?
[05:25:21] <BtbN> what?
[05:25:30] <BtbN> This is IRC
[05:25:54] <launchd> thunderbird has an irc client built in
[05:26:05] <sheep> does chatzilla work in thunderbird?
[05:26:11] <d4n13L> as far as I remember it doesn't work, because thunderbird doesn't support server passwords in it's IRC client
[05:26:54] <yang_qwq> d4n13L: yep
[05:27:13] <yang_qwq> um
[05:29:09] <yang_qwq> so is there a way to solve?
[05:29:31] <BtbN> File a bug with Mozilla to add support for passwords
[05:30:24] <yang_qwq> ok
[05:30:32] <yang_qwq> thanks

[16:34:41] <rj1> hi, i'm trying to write a python module for znc, it is a user module, but i want to be able to use it to send messages to any of the networks the user has connected to. i am following the doxygen docs, but nothing i'm trying seems to be working, stuff like the following doesn't seem to be working at all:
[16:34:43] <rj1>             network = self.GetUser().FindNetworks('network-name')
[16:34:43] <rj1>             network.PutIRC("PRIVMSG #channel :message goes here")
[16:34:58] <rj1> is anyone able to give any advice on this? thanks

[18:45:24] <Jenna16bit> Hello! At the risk of being a jerk for joining and asking immediately, I have a hopefully simple question. I've been running ZNC on my home network, and it's fantastic. I often swap between a few machines. Right now, buffer playback happens once only if nothing has been connected. Is there some way to get it to playback buffer for every channel up to "X" previous lines every time? Would make it easier swapping between clients a lot 
[18:45:24] <Jenna16bit> when I don't leave them running.
[18:45:53] <Jenna16bit> I'm guessing either the answer is "no" or "a couple lines in the config I'm missing"?

[18:50:42] <MetaNova> absolute bare minimum answer: load route_replies for each network, and enable persistent buffers
