[01:28:08] <hoppity> thus making that random giberish sort of like an API key. 
[01:28:18] <hoppity> My API will only have one client.
[01:30:34] <mouseghost> well now you told us the key so probably not very safe...
[01:30:35] <mouseghost> idk
[01:33:39] <hoppity> mouseghost: haha that's not my key ovbiously, my real key is ieuhRWGHwruruhwfrWE  
[01:33:41] <hoppity> jk
[01:33:52] <mouseghost> hm
[01:34:33] <mouseghost> i mean, why would it be unsafe?
[01:35:09] <hoppity> idk, I am usually surprised  at how clever hackers can be
[01:35:22] <hoppity> and how insecure, secure-seeming things can be
[01:35:54] <mouseghost> idk
[01:36:08] <mouseghost> isnt there parametrization something-something in phoenix routing?
[01:36:15] <mouseghost> like /:blablabla/bruh
[01:36:26] <mouseghost> instead of hard-coding the api key
[01:36:33] <mouseghost> and also constant-time compare
[01:39:38] <hoppity> sure there is parameterization but I only have one client, literally
[01:40:50] <mouseghost> i knoooow
[01:41:14] <mouseghost> but hardcoding it sounds risky

[01:43:48] <hoppity> so you are saying :blablabla should probably be in a api_keys table kind of thing?
[01:50:19] <mouseghost> idk not a table
[01:50:19] <mouseghost> but
[01:50:27] <mouseghost> i wouldnt store the key in the routing thing directly
[01:50:59] <mouseghost> i would rather perform the check if the api key matches somewhere else, in the controller or something
[01:51:18] <mouseghost> but be aware that this comparison should be constant-time
[01:51:31] <hoppity> I am thinking I will treat it as a regular password. Store the APIKEY hash in my api_keys table and then simply compare hash vs hash.
[01:51:35] <hoppity> Sounds secure enough lol
[01:51:41] <mouseghost> could be that too lol

[10:15:01] <serafeim> ah
[10:15:07] <serafeim> there is a free tier though
[10:15:25] <serafeim> and IIRC heroku allows you to create free apps
[10:15:30] <serafeim> without credit card
[10:16:13] <serafeim> i'm afraid to add a credit card. i had added a credit card to AWS and it charched me money because their UI was too complex to know that the instances were running
[10:16:41] <serafeim> actually it kept charging me for some months because I wasn't able to shut down their freaking instances
[10:17:08] <Nicd> > You will also be prompted for credit card payment information, required for charges outside the free tier on Fly.
[10:17:16] <Nicd> so looks like they want your credit card info to protect themselves
[10:17:59] <serafeim> Nicd: i understand but can't they could just threshold the costs on the free tier if there wasn't credit card info
[10:18:13] <Nicd> I don't work for them
[10:18:14] <Nicd> ask them
[10:18:24] <serafeim> i think chris mccord works for fly.io
[10:18:55] <Nicd> he's not here
[10:19:09] <Nicd> and it's a thing you should really take up with their customer support

[13:11:18] <serafeim> it's here: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/controllers.html#assigning-layouts
[13:11:23] <serafeim> it doesn't take into account the root layout
[13:12:17] <serafeim> for example it has the snippet: `def index(conn, _params), do:   conn   |> put_layout(false)   |> render("index.html")` and mentions that if you do that "... we should see a very different page, one with no title, logo image, or CSS styling at all."
[13:13:34] <Nicd> you can propose a rewrite with a PR
[13:14:01] <serafeim> that ain't true because the root_layout will be used so you'll just see a page without the app.html.heex layout file. if i wanted to see the page without any styling you'd need to use `` put_root_layout(false) `` 
[13:15:12] <serafeim> Nicd: i can't propose a rewrite because somebody needs to introduce the root layout there and it's too big a change.
[13:15:29] <Nicd> you can be that somebody :)
[13:15:42] <Nicd> you can also file an issue about it, just check there isn't one already
[13:15:47] <serafeim> no no i don't have so much time. but i will file the issue.

[13:54:01] <DerShodan> Hi! I need help with elixir data structures - can any1 explain to me how you go about updateing a struct from a map? 
[13:54:18] <mouseghost> DerShodan, what do you mean
[13:54:29] <DerShodan> E.g. there is a classic %User{} struct with `first_name `last_name etc 
[13:54:45] <DerShodan> and i get a Map with some data   %{first_name: "xxx"}
[13:55:00] <DerShodan> now i want to update the structs same-named keys with whatever is in that Map
[13:55:16] <serafeim> DerShodan: try merging ?
[13:55:38] <Nicd> you can do it implicitly with Map.merge or explicitly with struct update syntax `%User{data | key1: val1, key2: val2}`
[13:55:52] <DerShodan> %{
[13:55:52] <DerShodan>   :__struct__ => YodelOne.Users.User,
[13:55:53] <DerShodan>   :contacts => [],
[13:55:53] <DerShodan>   :first_name => "Mario",
[13:55:54] <DerShodan>   :id => "232cad70-640c-4b36-ab0c-1300ed7f6d45",
[13:55:54] <DerShodan>   :last_name => "Uher",
[13:55:55] <DerShodan>   :phone_number => "+1485136290",
[13:55:55] <DerShodan>   "first_name" => "testFN"
[13:55:56] <DerShodan> }
[13:56:05] <serafeim> please don't paste here
[13:56:09] <Nicd> the danger with Map.merge is that you can break the struct if there's extra keys / wrong keys in the map
[13:56:14] <DerShodan> see how the key first_name is duplicated - this is result of simple Map.merge (sorry for pasting)
[13:56:24] <Nicd> if you are handling user input, I would suggest using Ecto changesets
[13:56:28] <Nicd> they are made for this
[13:56:35] <serafeim> DerShodan: the one is an atom and the other is a string
[13:56:47] <DerShodan> i noticed that
[13:56:48] <serafeim> so it ain't really duplicated
[13:56:59] <DerShodan> right - but the map key was an atom too
[13:57:25] <Nicd> it wasn't
[13:57:30] <Nicd> Map.merge doesn't change the key types
[13:57:41] <serafeim> you may want to convert all your keys to strings and then merge
[13:57:51] <DerShodan> thats a very helpful hint man - thanks a lot ill quickly double check that!
[13:57:51] <Nicd> that would break the struct
[13:57:58] <serafeim> ah yes
[13:58:12] <Nicd> I really suggest using Ecto and its changesets
[13:58:22] <serafeim> then you must convert the strings to atoms but only if the atoms are not user input
[13:58:39] <Nicd> Ecto already takes in string keyed maps and handles validations for you
[13:59:05] <DerShodan> this won't handle user input in that specific case, but thanks for the tipp
[13:59:22] <DerShodan> maybe you are right and instead of re-inventing the wheel changesets are the way to go
[14:00:13] <Nicd> since Ecto can be used without DB just as an input handling & validation library
[14:01:33] <DerShodan> good point - thanks
[14:04:08] <DerShodan> found the culprit - the code i am using is serializing the map in json, then deserializing. this is why my atoms became strings :)
[14:16:32] <DerShodan> found the culprit - the code i am using is serializing the map in json, then deserializing. this is why my atoms became strings :)
[14:16:40] <DerShodan> oops
[14:18:44] <Nicd> you found two culprits! nice
[14:20:15] <serafeim> hey Nicd i fell upon this problem: https://elixirforum.com/t/port-open-eacces-on-windows/5442
[14:20:47] <serafeim> i have more or less the same ... i've got this configuration: https://dpaste.org/Kopv and it breaks on the npx
[14:20:54] <serafeim> how should i change it to work ?
[14:22:40] <serafeim> you mention using port_open with cmd.exe but how will this work in this case ?
[14:23:53] <Nicd> I don't know how the watchers are run
[14:24:43] <Nicd> you can just add `"c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe", "/c",` before the rest of the args but presumably then it'll show a shell window if it even works
[14:24:55] <serafeim> yes me neither
[14:25:06] <Nicd> and of course the PATH might no longer be ok inside the cmd shell
[14:25:32] <Nicd> in general development on Windows is a pain that I don't wish to get into too much
[14:27:42] <serafeim> ah well

[23:41:46] <hoppity> Hi guys, how should I configure my prod.exs if I want my app to be served from subdomain.myapp.com ?
[23:47:33] <benwilson512> hoppity: you can set that domain in the `url` part but that's really just about how phoenix generates the URLs
[23:47:50] <benwilson512> routing traffic from that subdomain to your phoenix app is a matter for your DNS server
[23:49:56] <hoppity> benwilson512: this is how I have it right now  https://dpaste.org/pxXi
[23:50:22] <benwilson512> hoppity: sure that looks fine
[23:50:28] <hoppity> I have the subdomain pointed already no problem there but I suppose I have a misconfiguration on prod.exs
[23:50:31] <hoppity> hmm weird
[23:50:43] <hoppity> it was working with an earlier domain, swapped and not no longer working
[23:50:50] <benwilson512> what does "no longer working" mean?
[23:51:15] <hoppity> i'll show you the error
[23:51:52] <hoppity> this is what I am seeing on iEX on my AWS server https://dpaste.org/yANt
[23:52:16] <hoppity> its like the requests keep coming from the domain that I just removed
[23:52:43] <hoppity> I missed one line:   14:21:23.207 [error] Could not check origin for Phoenix.Socket transport.
