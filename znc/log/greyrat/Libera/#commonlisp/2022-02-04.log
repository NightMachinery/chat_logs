[00:58:07] <sveit_> one simple example is (constantp '(make-array 3 :initial-element 0) env) is always nil, for example, but (constantp '#(0 0 0) env) is t. to start, i'd like to know if people have techniques to establish that the former can be inspected at compile time

[00:59:08] <phoe> well, CONSTANTP returns false since the form doesn't really evaluate to a constant - but you can try to do a few things at macroexpansion time
[00:59:18] <phoe> first, try to macroexpand that form just in case it's a global or local macro
[00:59:39] *** Quits: tyson2 (~user@bras-base-toroon0624w-grc-17-50-101-91-98.dsl.bell.ca) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:59:52] <phoe> second, check if it's a call to CL:MAKE-ARRAY like (make-array ...) or (funcall 'make-array ...) or (apply 'make-array ...) or (funcall #'make-array ...) or (apply #'make-array ...)
[01:01:30] <phoe> and once you got this, check if the arguments in that call are CONSTANTP - it'll be a bit more troublesome for APPLY because the arguments themselves might be elsewhere
[01:04:20] <sveit_> phoe: yes, I guess essentially what I would like is some code-walker that completely macroexpands a form, then checks if every function argument is constantp. I figured that (a) there might be some more elegant solution and (b) regardless, people had established solutions for this type of thing
[01:04:55] <sveit_> and every binding, etc. (and say that all the functions are cl:... which it's undefined behaviour to rebind)
[01:05:45] <phoe> why?
[01:05:55] <phoe> I mean, your compiler should be smart enough to do that for you
[01:06:12] <phoe> (in most cases)
[01:06:33] <sveit_> I may (do :)) want to optimize some generated code in case certain information can be established at compile time
[01:06:54] <phoe> well, forms like (make-array 3) are naturally not CONSTANTP
[01:07:19] <sveit_> phoe: I can see why (make-array 3) is not constantp, but why not (make-array 3 :initial-contents 0)?
[01:07:28] <phoe> because it isn't constantp either
[01:07:31] <sveit_> sorry (make-array 3 :initial-element 0)
[01:07:37] <Bike> cos if you do that twice you'll get two distinct arrays.
[01:07:37] <phoe> it isn't constantp either
[01:07:55] <Bike> (eql (make-array 3 :initial-element 0) (make-array 3 :initial-element 0)) => nil
[01:08:31] <sveit_> but (eql #(0 0 0) #(0 0 0)) => nil
[01:08:50] <sveit_> and (constantp '#(0 0 0)) => t?
[01:08:57] <phoe> #(0 0 0) is a literal
[01:09:03] <phoe> mutating it is UB
[01:09:25] <phoe> literal (quoted) lists, arrays, vectors, strings, and so on are constant data in CL
[01:09:36] <phoe> so #(0 0 0) is constant by definition
[01:09:43] <Bike> (eql #(0 0 0) #(0 0 0)) is actually allowed to be t, also.
[01:09:44] <phoe> and if you dare mutate it, it's your fault
[01:09:56] <phoe> oh right, if the compiler does enough constant-folding
[01:10:33] *** Joins: tyson2 (~user@bras-base-toroon0624w-grc-17-50-101-91-98.dsl.bell.ca)
[01:11:28] <sveit_> anyway, whether something is constantp is actually a bit of a diversion here, I was just trying to give a sensible starting point for what I'm after by relating to constantp. of course it would be a tool (for example, one might expand code enough and check that the first argument to make-array is constantp to infer the length, etc)
[01:11:51] <phoe> yes, that's actually understandable
[01:12:09] <Bike> generally, determining interesting information is a huge pain in the ass to do on the actual source code. compilers usually transform into some IR before doing any solid analyses.
[01:12:12] <phoe> if you can precompute the array length then you can generate code that doesn't check for length at runtime and so on
[01:12:34] <Bike> at which point macroexpanders have all completed.
[01:13:57] <Bike> sbcl is smart enough to collapse (length (make-array 4)) to 4, looks like, as long as the array isn't also adjustable.
[01:14:02] <sveit_> i'm just surprised that this isn't some common enough thing for lispers to want/do that there isn't some (as I have said necessarily partial) solution people have developed
[01:14:21] <Bike> the usual solution is a compiler.
[01:14:38] <Bike> user compiler extensions are an interesting thing that i would like to make more available, but working out the details is pretty involved.
[01:14:39] <phoe> usually not worth the effort, array length checks are damn cheap
[01:14:59] <phoe> unless you want to get more and more details out of your code, at which point things become troublesome
[01:15:20] <phoe> better to write your own subcompiler then, via a macro or a compiler macro
[01:15:22] <sveit_> Bike: yes, but in my case I'd like to not throw away SBCL/CL just to expand to a different macro if the length of an array can be proven to be 1 or 2 :)
[01:15:29] <NotThatRPG> sveit_: We have this problem in the ITERATE macro: its code-walker can't handle MACROLET
[01:16:56] <sveit_> phoe: actually I have been wondering exactly about this, are there canonical examples of large macro-based subcompilers one can look at to learn? whenever I have any complexity my macros tend to explode and I code myself into a corner with a bunch of unmaintainable special cases
[01:17:20] <Bike> loop and iterate are pretty huge, if you mean that kind of thing.
[01:17:21] <phoe> sveit_: iterate, cl-ppcre, trivia, optima, cl-cont
[01:17:41] <Bike> (loop is part of the standard, of course, but it's generally implemented similarly to a user macro)
[01:17:42] <phoe> also cl:formatter which is a good entry point into FORMAT
[01:17:57] <Bike> does ppcre do complicated macro stuff?
[01:18:15] <phoe> I don't think it does, but it *is* a compiler in a way
[01:18:34] <phoe> at least when it comes to turning regexes into code
[01:19:02] <sveit_> thanks! actually I always wondered how iterate did portable code-walking, I guess the answer is it doesn't :)
[01:19:12] <phoe> oh, the topic of portable code walking
[01:19:45] <phoe> NotThatRPG: why/how cannot it handle macrolet though?
[01:20:09] <Bike> cos there's no standard way to get a macroexpander function in an arbitrary lexical environment, probably?
[01:20:45] <NotThatRPG> @phoe: Not sure why not, but presumably because macrolet can depend on arbitrary context. It's probably not computable to walk it without evaluating it in context, which isn't available at macro expansion time
[01:20:53] *** Quits: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:21:07] <Bike> could use cltl2:enclose, perhaps, but not every implementation has that
[01:21:39] <phoe> hmm - a macroexpander function, yes, but isn't a macroexpansion enough? you can grab the &environment object and call MACROEXPAND-1 with it as the second parameter
[01:21:53] <Bike> if you're walking the code the macro function does not actually exist
[01:21:54] <phoe> or do you specifically need the function?

[01:38:16] <NotThatRPG> phoe: Yes, that's right. ITERATE needs to code walk to find iterate clauses and translate them.
[01:38:44] <phoe> NotThatRPG: OK
[01:39:54] <NotThatRPG> just recently found that at least one compiler introduces its own MACROLETs, potentially breaking ITERATE in odd places.
[01:40:05] <Bike> oh, really? which one is that?
[01:40:43] <NotThatRPG> Bike: I *think* both CCL and Allegro do this on some occasions.
[01:41:31] <Bike> interesting. when you say introduces, do you just mean a standard macro that expands into a macrolet, or something else? (because e.g. with-hash-table-iterator is going to do that anywhere, i would imagine)
[01:44:34] <NotThatRPG> Actually no, sorry -- it was COMPILER-LET.
[01:45:11] <NotThatRPG> ... and we found a work-around, which was just to not try to walk the bindings. I *think* that's fine.
[01:46:00] <Bike> oh, that weird one
[01:46:07] <NotThatRPG> Should make a bug-fix release, but I'm so busy with stuff....

[10:50:33] <minion> kathe, memo from beach: Whether some other language (other than the one that is the topic of this channel) is "a lisp" or not is debatable, but such debates are off topic here, and are better conducted in the #lisp channel.  There is no widely agreed-upon definition of "Lisp", so such debates are largely pointless.

[18:01:47] <dieggsy> With quicklisp configured for both SBCL and Allegro, after starting a REPL I can just do a (require :package) in SBCL but cannot in Allegro (need to do ql:quickload). Why might this be? is there something about SBCL that quicklisp is handling differently, or some implementation difference in the require paths?

[18:02:32] <phoe> REQUIRE is implementation-dependent
[18:02:46] <phoe> it's possible that SBCL has it configured to trigger ASDF, but Allegro doesn't

[18:03:57] <dlowe> there's usually some mechanism to hook into REQUIRE

[21:37:56] <Bike> slime-compile-and-load-file will compile the file first, which can result in different effects in a few ways. hanging isn't usual, though.

[22:09:22] <NotThatRPG> This hook is something that Fare added a long time ago, and I don't fully understand the logic in the footer.
[22:10:40] <Bike> just cos, number one reason it would work on some implementations and not others is that there's not actually a standard way to accomplish this
[22:12:32] <NotThatRPG> Bike: For Allegro, one could hook require by using defadvice or their new, snazzy function wrappers. I will add an issue for this.

[22:20:53] <etimmons> NotThatRPG: Unrelated, but do you have any trick to make M-. work when developing ASDF? It's annoying that it goes to the concatenated asdf.lisp
[22:21:46] <etimmons> If not, I've got my own trick developed. I push :asdf-devel to _features_ and it skips the concatenation step, so M-. goes to the "true" source location
[22:21:59] <etimmons> Could open an MR if that sounds useful
[22:23:13] <NotThatRPG> etimmons: I have something I picked up from Fare...

[22:24:56] <akater[m]> etimmons: Just load the relevant files instead of the concatenated one, no?
[22:26:18] <etimmons> Sure, but that requires me to already know which file the function I want to modify is located in
[22:26:24] <akater[m]> Should be safe to hot reload iiuc.
