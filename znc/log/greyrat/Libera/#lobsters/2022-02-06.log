[14:04:25] *** Quits: rickybob2 (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:07:06] <albertito> riv: it's probably increadibly cheap, holding open a tcp connection is quite efficient. If you compare it to frequent open-and-close polling, it's probably much cheaper, considering you would do a TLS negotiation on each poll
[14:07:23] <riv> oh cool! that's great news
[14:08:35] <albertito> riv: it's an interesting question though. It'd love to see a good analysis on it, e.g. how often do you have to poll in order to be more energy-efficient, what's the impact of different TLS options (there's some new stuff that makes reconnections faster and computationally cheaper), etc.
[14:10:03] <riv> ah yes
[14:10:10] <riv> because you do not need instant updates when you are afk
[14:10:21] <albertito> riv: but you need very little state to keep a tcp connection open, and it doesn't even mandate keepalives. Although most irc servers do send a ping ~1/minute or so
[14:10:30] <riv> so it may be using more energy to provide that as opposed to giving a block of updates when you return
[14:10:35] <albertito> riv: well, except if you want notifications when you get /msg or your nick gets a mention
[14:10:53] <riv> that's true - there could be 3 modes maybe
[14:11:39] <riv> all instant updates (like irc), instant notifications only (doesn't bother sending messages unless you get mentioned, then it sends the whole block), completely disconnected (but you can get a block of updates when you connect)
[14:13:35] <albertito> in the big picture, though, my guess it's basically negligible anyway; so optimizing for energy consumptions may not be practical, or it might end up being detrimental if the alternative ends up causing more computational power when looking as a whole (e.g. tls negotiations, more in-memory state, etc.)
[14:13:49] <riv> ok
[14:14:02] <albertito> riv: that would also mean servers need to store what happened, which you also need to factor into the cost
[14:14:41] <albertito> but all of this is purely speculation on my part, don't believe me too much :P
