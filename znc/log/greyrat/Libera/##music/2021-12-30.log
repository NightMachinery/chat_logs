[00:18:21] <artao> OH DOGGAMIT!! The dimo on my dizi broke again <sigh> ... it's tricky to put a new one on right. to get the right buzz
[00:18:43] <artao> some consider it an art unto itself
[00:19:28] <artao> it has to be not too tight and not too loose and pleated just right, and perpendicular to the flute, and with the grain of the bamboo skin dimo in the right direction
[00:21:27] <artao> too tight? no buzz. too loose or not pleated right? bad buzz harmonics
[00:21:51] <artao> and the buzz is the distinguishing characteristic of the dizi

[00:28:30] <sublim20> NOT FUNNY
[00:28:43] <sublim20> that squirrel killed my father
[00:29:06] <Panther> The UIAA standard for climbing karabiners demands a static strength of more than 20kN. This value corresponds to holding a mass of about 2 tons before breaking. 20kN is more than the worst conceivable fall in a climbing accident.
[00:29:08] <morf> cool
[00:29:16] <morf> too bad it missed you 
[00:29:40] * Panther just got one with 24kN strength.
[00:31:50] <artao> i trained that squirrel, but then it went rogue
[00:32:20] <artao> static tho. what about dynamic?
[00:32:28] <artao> that's when they break. on the fall and sudden stop
[00:32:32] <artao> FUCK

[02:29:32] <morlog> mine held up against concrete and limestone
[02:29:36] <artao> And anyhow, the economy of Cypress is pretty shit, no? So it's already broken. :P
[02:29:41] <morlog> had to use a file to shape it
[02:29:47] <artao> ABUYSYER!!

[02:37:11] <artao> useless
[02:37:17] <Panther> They are self-tightening.
[02:37:25] <artao> my main fishing knot is the uni-knot
[02:37:41] <artao> quite good on rope too, up to a certain thickness. Better on thinner
[02:38:12] <artao> great for combining materials tho. Like monofiliment of kevlar braid to fluorocarbon leader
[02:38:20] <artao> also very good for lines of different diameter
[02:38:23] <artao> and super easy to tie
[02:38:37] <artao> i was joking re: fig. 8 knot
[02:38:39] <artao> :P
[02:39:05] <artao> still tho .... eh. very much depends on the line
[02:39:18] <artao> nylon? nope. kevlar braid? nope
[02:39:20] <artao> anything slippery

[03:13:09] <aldcor> so, Aleksander S ? 200 years together.. noone ?
[03:13:10] <louipc> some reading is more laborious than others
[03:13:32] <artao> not effort in reading, effort in comprehending how anyone could think such insanity
[03:13:33] <artao> lol
[03:13:33] <Panther> Try switching from reading Camus to Proust. :)
[03:13:36] <louipc> i couldnt read any more george rr martin after 2 books
[03:14:00] <artao> tho kazinski's writing isn't very good either, so also not easy to read
[03:14:09] <artao> at least ayn rand can write decently
[03:14:14] <artao> i'll give her that
[03:14:22] <louipc> i could probably take about half of stephen king's works
[03:14:26] <artao> write it in my own diahrea shit on her gravestone
[03:14:27] <Panther> It took me a few days to adjust to the vast difference in style.
[03:14:47] <aldcor> haven't read Camus
[03:15:21] <louipc> artao: wow u sound hurt mang
[03:15:27] <louipc> what she do to u
[03:15:30] <artao> what "solutions" does Teddy provide?
[03:15:45] <artao> i'm just a gen-x cynic is all
[03:16:01] <artao> also in a bad mental state since october
[03:16:07] <Panther> I was reading Sisyphus at the time, but I like a lot of his stuff. The Fall is my favorite.
[03:16:12] <artao> tho today is better than most
[03:16:29] <artao> that shit is all dull and pointless
[03:16:31] <louipc> isnt anarchism a big genx thing tho?
[03:16:38] <artao> studied it in college, sure
[03:16:45] <artao> learn what people thought before we did
[03:16:59] <artao> who cares who it was or when it was or who thought what and who argued with whom
[03:17:02] <artao> fuck that shit
[03:17:09] <artao> i dunno
[03:17:12] <artao> like i said
[03:17:12] <aldcor> but afaik, french philosophers are resposible for decadent thinking. Irrational interpretation of reality. Denial of biology and physical reality. Whatever you think is real, that is real.. and stuff like that. Absolute madness.
[03:17:13] <artao> cynic
[03:17:37] <artao> german philosophers are responsible for fuck it all, nothing matters
[03:17:38] <artao> ;p
[03:17:52] <louipc> lol u just seem like u cant decide what to believe
[03:17:59] <louipc> so then you default back to status quo
[03:18:10] <artao> louipc i have very little respect, mostly derision, for libertarian bullshit
[03:18:18] <artao> tho i DO agree with some of it
[03:18:24] <artao> brb
[03:18:35] <louipc> re: my last 2 statements
[03:19:43] <louipc> my philosophy is cool and best. why bother reading other idiots ;)
[03:20:10] <aldcor> libertarian? What does it even mean today?
[03:20:21] <aldcor> i have noticed everyone is slightly insanse
[03:20:32] <louipc> no clue tahts why i like to avoid the term
[03:21:03] <louipc> but i have found one good and sane 'libertarian' group

[03:24:19] <aldcor> i don't take sides, I rather pay attention to individual. And if he identifies with group.. he's not individual anymore. He's possesed by ideology. Someone had saying: "People don't got ideas. Ideas got people" or smth like that.. Meaning, they behave according to specific doctrine and it's very hard to `get to them` as all they have is absolute conviction that `their reality` (doctrine they
[03:24:20] <aldcor> follow) is superior to anything else and so anything else should be silenced, cancelled, stopped, shamed. We know very well who they are ;)
[03:25:03] <aldcor> oh, yeah.. i'm just going along. I joined cause I expected musical discussion actually :D

[03:29:18] <artao> you're not my supervisor!!
[03:29:25] <louipc> no im not

[03:29:45] <macrobat> u r ur brothers keeper
[03:30:07] <louipc> u have the power macrobat 
[03:30:16] <LibertyDillo> aldcor> libertarian? What does it even mean today? << Try Mises.org and RonPaulInstitute.org :)
[03:30:34] <artao> as i said ... i'm not the one who brought up politics and philosophy
[03:30:49] <louipc> hey guyz wanna do a pledge to make this a good and mostly music chat
[03:30:50] <LibertyDillo> and it's the wrong channel for that discussion, try ##libertarian and #mises
[03:30:53] <artao> but i'll happily engage
[03:30:55] <artao> :D
[03:31:14] <artao> me? yeah
[03:31:14] <louipc> it will take guts
[03:31:16] <artao> sick of that shit
[03:31:17] <louipc> it will take courage
[03:31:21] <louipc> it will take discipline
[03:31:25] <artao> tho i STILL engage in it D'OH
[03:31:27] <artao> so tired
[03:31:28] <louipc> it will take sacrifice
[03:31:29] <artao> SO tired
[03:31:31] <artao> <sigh>
[03:31:44] <maplefinger> LibertyDillo has answered aldcor with the American version
[03:31:50] <artao> certainly food and fuel for MAKING music tho
[03:31:51] <artao> no?
[03:32:15] <artao> LOLwow wtf is this i've posted
[03:32:16] <artao> :O
[03:32:25] <artao> i don't think i've listened to it since i posted it LOL
[03:32:35] <louipc> ok u and me artao lets pledge to do our best to not perpetuate non music chat
[03:32:47] <artao> sry. can't
[03:32:52] <artao> cuz i do that myself
[03:32:54] <louipc> awwdang
[03:32:59] <artao> i'll try tho
[03:33:08] <artao> but ##music is a ........ "special" ... place
[03:33:13] <artao> just about anything goes
[03:33:21] <louipc> its not special
[03:33:30] <artao> want just music? that's #music. Where SVM is dictator (i assume, still)
[03:33:36] <louipc> because basically all of libera is this same kind of 'special'
[03:33:59] <artao> pretty much anything can be musically inspirational
[03:34:01] <louipc> yea i dont know wtf #music is 
[03:34:18] <artao> even political-philosophical convos
[03:34:27] <artao> well, in genral on IRC
[03:34:28] <louipc> you cant even post music in #music as far as i understand
[03:34:28] <louipc> so makes absolutely no sense
[03:34:38] <artao> a single # means it's meant to stay ON TOPIC
[03:34:42] <louipc> artao: ok but that's really not the point
[03:34:54] <artao> double ## means that's the general topic, but it strays
[03:35:07] <louipc> artao: i thought you cant post music links in #music
[03:35:27] <artao> i'm agreeing with you btw louipc ... i also don't want to have any poli-philo convos really
[03:35:32] <artao> i do that in my head plenty
[03:36:06] <artao> LOL wow wut?
[03:36:06] <louipc> right. so if we wanna cut down on that stuff we really gotta exercise some restraint on our own parts
[03:36:12] <artao> can't post links in #music?
[03:36:15] <louipc> we cant add to the problem
[03:36:20] <artao> wtf <facepalm> that's new to me
[03:36:38] <artao> well ... i'm done on that subject here ....
[03:36:39] <louipc> artao: yea as far as i understand... unless its 'relevant to the discussion'
[03:36:43] <artao> wtaf
[03:36:46] <artao> lmao wow
[03:36:47] <louipc> doest make sense
[03:37:04] <artao> no discussion of eating meat either i bet
[03:37:05] <louipc> so then how do you even start a discussion about a certain piece

[03:38:47] <louipc> i invited aldcor so he could share his music and discuss
[03:38:53] <artao> how crappy is my weird-ass music?
[03:38:53] <louipc> and i asked him what his gear was
[03:38:54] <artao> ;)
[03:39:04] <louipc> and then everyone just talked aobut bullshit
[03:39:04] <artao> ... alcor brought up the politics ...
[03:39:11] <louipc> no that was someone else
[03:39:15] <artao> eh

[18:13:18] <Panther> The huge, high-level modulator was also water-cooled. It could easily make 400 kW audio with both of its largely redundant modules simultaneously cranked to full rock and roll. 
[18:13:52] <Panther> Even more mindboggling were the two modulation transformers, one per module, each 37,000 pounds, oil filled, and 10 feet high.

[18:17:40] <phryk> Mhh, would this in principle be the right place to ask about speaker design, construction and related topics?
[18:18:12] <Panther> What's the worst thing that could happen?
[18:18:54] <phryk> Panther: was that directed at me or about the insane amp? ^^
[18:19:01] <Panther> hmm
[18:19:04] <Panther> You
[18:19:05] <Panther> :)
[18:19:25] <Panther> That amp was built with redundant parts in case of failure.
[18:19:38] <phryk> resilient design :3
[18:19:55] <phryk> So, my name is basically John Snow.
[18:20:24] <GaZ-mAnIaC> WLW probably holds the record
[18:21:03] <phryk> I want to build custom speakers (first for home use with 32cm sub chassis and then a PA version with 46cm subs) and build something to actually drive the whole thing from DC.
[18:21:12] <phryk> First things first: component selection.
[18:21:38] <Panther> How many speakers do you want in the cabinet?
[18:21:41] *** Joins: FreeRangeDillo (~Kurt@136.49.102.16)
[18:22:02] <phryk> cabinet? I want 2 speakers both in their own case.
[18:23:03] <Panther> A cabinet is what I usually call the 'box' where the speakers, the wiring, switches, etc.. all go in.
[18:23:15] <phryk> For the speaker components themselves, my approach would basically be to take the frequence curves of potential components and overlay them over each other (properly scaled) and see that i get as close to a straight line over the whole spectrum as i can – does that make sense? 
[18:24:06] <phryk> Each speaker should be 3 or 4 way, not yet sure if i want dedicated drivers (is that the right word?) for kickbass…
[18:24:27] <Panther> Somewhat, but there are crossover switches that can divert different frequencies to different speakers.
[18:25:09] <Panther> Often, speakers come with those as adjustable knobs so you can tailor the sound.
[18:25:16] <phryk> Crossover switches are the hardware components implementing filtery things like lowpass?
[18:25:34] <phryk> Ah, so they parameterize the filter.
[18:25:53] *** Joins: MusicalDillo (~Kurt@136.49.102.16)

[18:26:50] <phryk> Panther: Ah, not sure I want that. I think I might want one amp per driver.

[18:30:29] <Panther> ha
[18:30:42] <Panther> I wanted to get a kick scooter.
[18:32:41] <phryk> Anyhow, my approach for frequency filtering is either custom built RC filters designed for the specific speaker components *or* a custom digital DSP thing, but that's more of a future thing.
[18:33:08] <Panther> Personally, I never built my own speakers, but a friend of mine in HS did. They had a class for it.
[18:33:09] <phryk> Currently I'm more wondering about good options to drive speakers from a DC source. Someone recommended me amp boards they used for a mobile PA, but I forgot to write it down :F

[18:36:23] <Panther> You prolly know most of that, but if you are concerned about the amp and the speakers being compatible, it might have a few ideas.
[18:37:29] <phryk> oh, I didn't even think that could be a problem. only wasn't sure if DC audio amps aren't horribly inefficient – but it seems to work well enough for cars, so…^^
[18:38:52] <phryk> But I definitely don't know enough to select fitting amp boards on aliexpress and finished DC amps seem to either just be car amps or overly pricy.
