[10:22:34] <epony> if you don't know, you need to check your sources for definitions of "free"
[10:22:45] <qrpnxz> i mean free as in freedom ofc

[10:23:43] <qrpnxz> epony, you realize this is the Free Software Foundation channel and when we talk about software being "free" here it's almost undoubtedly first-and-foremost free as in freedom
[10:23:57] <epony> labrador, that's very immature and pointless, go polish your manners

[10:28:26] <labrador> epony, nah
[10:28:26] <epony> try it
[10:28:43] <qrpnxz> i boot up rhel i can download the source package, change it, rebuild it, install my modified version
[10:28:48] <epony> when was the last time you made a change on the direction or some program component part of RHEL ?
[10:28:48] <qrpnxz> i can share it with whomever
[10:28:52] <labrador> See this is what I'm talking about...what are you even doing here epony if you think gpl gives no freedom at all?

[10:29:47] <qrpnxz> no direct control, but ofc i can contribute to their upstream which is fedora and centos stream
[10:29:50] <epony> so you can't exert 2 of your freedoms
[10:29:59] <qrpnxz> which?
[10:30:01] <epony> and the other 2 come at a great cost

[10:31:21] <epony> so effectively you have as little freedoms with RHEL as you have with commercial software, and that is exactly because it is commercial and also proprietary (owned software you do NOT control in any way)
[10:31:24] <qrpnxz> none of the freedoms involves having control of upstream. You can redistribute your modifications, but there's no obligation for upstream to use them. That would be terrible
[10:31:34] <epony> so, WHAT FREEDOMS exactly do YOU have with RHEL?
[10:32:09] <qrpnxz> i have the freedom to use as i please, modify it, share the software, and share my modifications
[10:32:19] <epony> you can't even get a copy of it since it is expensive to purchase for individuals.. above the price of your combined computing hardware at home
[10:32:43] <epony> you have nonsense marketing leaflets to sell on behalf of IBM/Redhat
[10:32:47] <qrpnxz> you are allowed to charge for distribution of free software, that's an important freedom

[10:33:19] <epony> now turn on the fan to dispell that smoke..

[10:33:50] <epony> cause you're so rusty you barely recite these any more
[10:35:11] <epony> "RHEL" presented as an example of FREEDOMS.. that's as absurd as presenting any corporation as a foundation of free software projects that is working in the interest of the people
[10:35:30] <qrpnxz> i don't have to distribute software i have on my computer to you at no cost. How could I ask you to do that? I can ask for any amount i want. If i distribute a binary to you i should of course give you the source code however.
[10:35:43] <epony> get this: you're fired as an advisor of freedoms.
[10:36:26] <qrpnxz> well i don't quit ;)

[10:39:54] <epony> you can not exercise your freedoms
[10:39:59] <qrpnxz> it is, if you have rhel you have the source code.
[10:40:09] <epony> not enough
[10:40:25] <qrpnxz> source code of every package is not enough?
[10:40:35] <qrpnxz> it's the whole distro
[10:40:58] <qrpnxz> people just copy it and repackage it with new label. That's rocky, alpine, centos, oracle

[10:54:09] <epony> so naive people pick their advice and get stuffed as a result
[10:54:38] <epony> answer this question now, novice apprentice, does FSF approve RHEL as a free distribution or not?
[10:55:28] <qrpnxz> even Debian is not FSDG lmao. Red Hat would have to be heavily outwardly anti-proprietary support to even begin be on that list
[10:56:37] <epony> so you're both claiming RHEL is supposedly free software, whic it is not, so you're in contradiction with the FSF guide-lines and classification of free software
[10:57:10] <qrpnxz> to be FSDG compliant it's not enough to be 100% free software, so that's a terrible guideline

[11:43:06] <epony> and evaluate for yourself how many of the drivers that require non-free firmware are under GPL
[11:43:08] <qrpnxz> i would likewise link you to wikipedia on the work they have done https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat#Programs_and_projects
[11:44:45] <qrpnxz> yes, they have bought many companies, and from those purchases have freed important programs

[11:51:14] <qrpnxz> i cannot even name a proprietary program red hat distributes. Perhaps they have some. I've never heard of them.

[12:11:28] <qrpnxz> other distro are not required at all to use red hats patches either :/
[12:11:42] <qrpnxz> precisely because it's free
[12:11:44] <epony> Redhat is a proprietary commercial corporate business.
[12:11:53] <qrpnxz> it's not proprietary
[12:12:14] <epony> it is, because that company "owns" it

[12:12:52] <qrpnxz> in as much as Torvalds "owns" the copyright to his part of the kernel, and in turn freely license it
[12:13:04] <epony> no, these are incomparable
[12:13:29] <qrpnxz> not so, the patches red hat offer linux are just as free as the code linus wrote himself
[12:13:40] <qrpnxz> both are GPL

[12:37:45] <qrpnxz> let's say hypothetically there was no way to contribute to rhel. Like Red Hat just freeze the OS at 8.5. It's still free. I still have the source code. I can still change it, i can still use it how i like, i can still distribute it. Nothing changed with respect to software freedom, because red hat distributing my changes or not is not relevant to software freedom. It's not even required by FS
[12:37:47] <qrpnxz> DG. If Parabola GNU/Linux accepted no contributions, it would still be a GNU free distro. Thankfully there are ways to contribute to RHEL, which go from simply contributing to the upstream package all the way to contributing directly to their continuous delivery distribution just upstream of rhel which is centos stream.
[12:39:13] <epony> you're starting with incorrect assumptiond..
[12:39:22] <qrpnxz> there's no assumption
[12:39:27] <epony> false

[12:40:25] <epony> nope

[12:40:57] <epony> you're totally talking random things
[12:41:08] <qrpnxz> every fedora release is a contribution to RHEL, every upstream change is an eventual contribution to RHEL, patches sent to centos stream are contribution to rhel
[12:41:21] <qrpnxz> but again this just doesn't matter for free software

[13:02:54] <epony> RHEL is non free
[13:02:58] <qrpnxz> wrong
[13:03:09] <epony> that's the reality
[13:03:11] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: ok, so the problem is that RedHat's development grind makes it hard to keep up
[13:03:19] <epony> impossible

[13:03:27] <epony> and has defects built in
[13:03:37] <epony> on many many fronts
[13:03:52] <epony> it is 20,000 people more than you the individual
[13:04:14] <epony> so it's 20K capacity to make changes that you can't compete or participate in any way
[13:04:38] <AwesomeAdam54321> but the majority of those changes are going to be defects
[13:04:53] <qrpnxz> this is just hearsay, and the fact that they release a lot of updates (which is sort of the opposite of rhel, it's precisely known for it's stability over decade period) is not relevant to your software freedoms on the releases that they distribute to you
[13:05:28] <qrpnxz> ability to compete is also not a software freedom
[13:05:38] <qrpnxz> ability to participate under the same name is not a software freedom
[13:06:07] <epony> it's relevant to the force feeding you software you must install to remain in business for which you have to pay support contract, which is what Microsoft does
[13:06:34] <epony> there the difference is just you get "view" capability, that's all
[13:06:48] <epony> while with MSFT you get none of that
[13:07:04] <qrpnxz> you don't have to install anything you don't want. Even if it was programmed to do that (which it is not because in enterprise upgrade are very deliberate) it's free software so you can change it to not do that.
[13:07:07] <epony> with RH you get "view" (download a mega bulk)
[13:07:35] <epony> so even the "view" is "difficult" and for an individual.. impossible
[13:07:55] <epony> it's not even in the range of FSF / GNU the project to upkeep with that
[13:08:12] <epony> it's beyond Debian by a factor of 10-20x times
[13:08:58] <qrpnxz> fedora moves like 10x faster, debian moves at about the same speed, bit faster.
[13:09:04] <epony> you have no idea how NON-FREE the freebies of Redhat actually are, and they are not freebies as they cost as much as  your hardware and the support contracts cost much more than that

[13:50:09] <DiffieHellman> 3>Another reason for selecting the GPLv3 license is that Runbox 7 utilizes the open source Xapian search engine library which is licensed under GPLv2. Forget to mention GPLv2-or-later huh?

[13:55:23] <DiffieHellman> GPLv3 is a the finest free software license, but it's seems pretty common to say you're going "open source" when you're just going source available.
[13:56:13] <DiffieHellman> They write "open source" everywhen in the announcment ingoring the GPLv3 logo with states that the GPLv3 is a "free software" license.

[18:20:45] <isf> <kompowiec2> isf, check midov.pl server ;) > the same they use the nonfree software for creation of account
[18:20:46] <kompowiec2> don't required captcha to register account but iirc he sometimes turn on/turn off registration
[18:21:07] <Andrew> justnrun your own server?
[18:21:17] <Andrew> and arent most public xmpp instances the same?
[18:22:02] <labrador> yeah well Andrew they need some way to cut down spam
[18:22:07] <labrador> And a captcha is the easiest
[18:22:07] <isf> see this kompowiec2, that is you are running in element thing to create the account: https://element.midov.pl/element/bundles/ba46e195d9291562f528/bundle.js
[18:22:24] <kompowiec2> > External script with no known license
[18:23:31] <kompowiec2> well, i know midov and he wouldn't allow himself to run any non-free syph, probably the web client matrix itself does not care about adding licenses.
[18:26:13] <isf> maybe we can send a recommendation to the developers to free their javascript
[18:27:45] <kompowiec2> it's generally sad that it is impossible to register matrix accounts like in XMPP, from the client...
[18:28:17] <AwesomeAdam54321> Is Element the only Matrix client?
[18:28:39] <kompowiec2> I used others but apparently in the early stage of development and I didn't see such an option.

[19:01:30] <isf> who are against the freeodm to sell?
[19:02:27] <epony> I don't have any problems.. I prefer some "valid" and "quality" discussion about decent naming and honest which is what, instead of calling commerce and captivity free, and gifts and open projects non-free, that is the opposite of that
[19:02:31] <qrpnxz> all last night epony and I were going back and forth on Red Hat. He kept going on about how they are non-free, when they RHEL is all free :/ his main problem seems to be they charge "too much"
[19:02:53] <qrpnxz> he also claim rhel is defective by design with no evidence
[19:03:26] <qrpnxz> see? lol like commerce or not is not a freedom question
[19:03:51] <qrpnxz> besides that it should be allowed
[19:03:55] <isf> if you cant comerce with your software that mean the software isnt free software
[19:03:57] <epony> qrpnxz, I explained but you don't pick up the ideas, and labrador attacked which interferes
[19:04:23] <labrador> epony, i did? YOU DID
[19:04:28] <epony> it's not really very important if this annoys you.. fine by me
[19:04:31] <labrador> I just retaliated
[19:04:58] <qrpnxz> i hear you, i just think your wrong. I ask what part of rhel is non-free, and you talk about things that have nothing to do with software freedom like red hat accepting your contributions, or how they charge money for distribution of software
[19:05:42] <river> qrpnxz: he is lying, RHEL is 100% free
[19:06:03] <labrador> river, he isn't lying he's just delusional
[19:06:03] <epony> yeah, I think you're referring to licensing, while I am discussing outline and net effects and control points and ownage of product - consumer relations
[19:06:07] <labrador> like always
[19:06:13] <kompowiec2> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#DoesTheGPLAllowMoney
[19:06:20] <kompowiec2> This practice does conform with the free software principles as espoused by the FSF
[19:06:46] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: What specific software is defective like you say it is? Is it a system component of RHEL?
[19:06:59] <qrpnxz> yes thank you kompowiec2
[19:07:06] <kompowiec2> np :)
[19:09:02] <epony> well, that's another topic about captivity and modularity, and it's going to be a bit more heated to accept because it is a controversy point, but.. the defects are not only built-in faults of security (which is speculative yet proven in the historic run) but much more quality of software design and indepencent portability and anti-pattern proliferation in the set of desktop environments and integrated software on and about it
[19:11:07] <epony> and yes, dependency problems like the init system debate is indicative of ownage and forced decision over other projects and distrubutions from a commerce vendor in the interest of big business and automation instead of direct handle by people and programs on par (fairly balanced)
[19:11:53] <qrpnxz> I don't think your red hat conspiracy is viable. Linus and the other high level maintainer don't have to (and certainly wouldn't want to) accept bug ridden patches. If red hat is purposely bugging the kernel flawlessly for 20 year goodness, maybe we didn't go to the moon because that's quite the magic trick.
[19:12:06] <epony> there is a concern about business needs taking over individuals and independent groups
[19:12:11] <kompowiec2> in the end, the developers have the deciding vote.
[19:12:13] <epony> you know it and you can't address it
[19:13:05] <qrpnxz> you keep talking about forcing this, forcing that, but absolutely nothing is forced. There's no legal requirement from anybody to either use red hat patches, or their programs.
[19:13:25] <epony> qrpnxz, Linus and other kernel maintainers and authors.. are working on the kernel, not the distributions and other utilities, so they control the kernel parts as design, to the degree the corporate participants are not pushing them around

[19:19:46] <isf> thanks
[19:19:54] <epony> kompowiec2, it worked in the interest of passing property from sun to oracle and apache foundation getting involved and none of them being the libre now
[19:20:06] <kompowiec2> why?
[19:20:32] <epony> so corporate start is likely to be kept around and resold between corporates, because it's a control point (and it's not going away)
[19:20:50] <kompowiec2> and what's wrong with that?
[19:20:53] <epony> once in the corporate control, it never goes away, if it has value and control "capacity" it is there to control and own
[19:21:02] <kompowiec2> if it's libre software, it's good and that's all
[19:21:08] <ggoes> isf: while i'm not about to make you quote a different way, it's really unconventional to do the > quoting style on irc and might annoy people
[19:21:09] <epony> kompowiec2, it's not free ;-) it's owned
[19:21:23] <ggoes> just saying
[19:21:27] <kompowiec2> every program belongs to some programmer?
[19:21:34] <qrpnxz> it has copyright holders, if that's what you mean, otherwise no
[19:22:13] <epony> yeah, but some programmers are individuals and independent groups that are not for profit and are interested in their own reliance on the software and in the public interest release it for participation
[19:23:05] <qrpnxz> and?
[19:23:21] <epony> while other programmers are businesses and corporate groups that are for profit and interested in their own control of software others are using and in their own interest release it for involvement / capture of audience and contributions as free labour
[19:23:44] <epony> so.. all software authors are equal, but some software authors are more equal than others
[19:24:02] <epony> kompowiec2, is that clearer to grasp now?
[19:24:17] <qrpnxz> i have a clear picture of irrelevant details yes
[19:24:24] <kompowiec2> epony, if you have the source code, you can change the program to run the way you want, not necessarily the way the company wants - it's the whole point
[19:24:33] <qrpnxz> what does that distiction have to do with software freedom
[19:25:09] <kompowiec2> ggoes, so what is correct way to quote? Just copy all the message?
[19:25:24] <qrpnxz> pls no
[19:25:24] <epony> kompowiec2, if that is the source code of a large project of say 10-20K developers, you're largely outnumbered and locked out of participation in their commerce and business interests
[19:25:47] <ggoes> usually you don't quote. irc's not really suited for long, drawn out conversations. that's better suited to email

[19:33:44] <kompowiec2> for example does exist freenix which is libre version of slackware, slackware doesn't completely care about freedom, and it's hard to separate free from nonfree, unlike debian.
[19:33:49] <epony> for profit is controversial to the free software, as it generates the profit on increase non-free features that get cranked in the allegedly free software
[19:34:45] <kompowiec2> epony, in case of RHEL, I am unable to find any nonfree software from RHEL except nonfree kernel blobs.
[19:35:03] <kompowiec2> but maybe I am wrong.
[19:35:13] <epony> the point is, you can't get free software (or expect it to be free) from a for profit distributor of software, you can only get free software and have any expectations about its freedom and reliance on that freedom to be stable or enduring the test of time, from a non-profit organisation
[19:35:16] <corwin> I don't see the controversy unless one is confused by "Free as in freedom".  A license either guarantees us the four freedoms, or it doesn't.  Whether the dev(s) want to make a living from their work seems clearly to be a different topic, to me.
[19:35:54] <kompowiec2> ^
[19:35:57] <epony> the licence is an indication, but not a delivery of that freedom
[19:36:41] <epony> it's a promise, that rarely becomes reality in the for profit model

[19:38:25] <kompowiec2> it's completely free software on GPL license but there is a fee to get the official binary,
[19:38:26] <epony> so are not a free software company, but profitable businesses
[19:38:54] *** Quits: lispmacs[work] (~lispmacs@fsf/member/lispmacs) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[19:39:12] <epony> so, the point is, freedom is in the non-profit domain, and not in the "included" leaflet
[19:39:44] <epony> ^ this was the point for today ;-)
[19:40:05] <kompowiec2> as long as you are able to modify the program, I don't care who does the program.

[19:42:12] <epony> you can disregard this, but it's not the really "freedom" qualifier
[19:42:39] <kompowiec2> I did not say whether I agree with it or not, but I am asking what it means.
[19:42:52] <madage> let me draw an analogy: epony is saying that having freedom on a UN chater os french declaration is not enough if some small group controls all resources worldwide
[19:42:58] <kompowiec2> if you don't like someone else's code, then you won't use it.
[19:42:58] <epony> freedom is in the parity of relation / equality of control and non-exploitation of either side
[19:43:13] <madage> or french..
[19:43:52] <kompowiec2> epony, Again, we reflect on the basic fact: you can always make a fork.
[19:44:00] <madage> white paper takes any garbage you write to it, but it does not mean much if you can't enforce or exercise those promises
[19:44:40] <kompowiec2> madage, just like an international agreement...
[19:44:46] <kompowiec2> ugh
[19:44:54] <epony> the outline of history is, where there is profit, there is disparity and unfairness, no freedoms capacity and degradation or errosion of other qualities of the software and other concepts when applied to them (from collectives of workgroups to international organisations)
[19:45:33] <kompowiec2> epony, again, you can make a fork. So?

[19:47:23] <epony> kompowiec2, I heard your point, but it's incorrect.. you can't make a fork of a project you can't approach due to the above inequalities of work force and other resources, you can whine about it, you can curse it, and you can abandon it, but the network effect will be pushing you around
[19:47:32] <madage> formal abstract freedom vs substantial pratical freedom
[19:47:46] <corwin> If you can't fork it then it isn't free software.
[19:48:11] <kompowiec2> and what does it matter?
[19:48:38] <epony> in short: for-profit is non-free, even if it is licensed as such and available in source snapshot
[19:48:52] <kompowiec2> some user disagreed with the GIMP name and created a glimpse. And where is the problem?
[19:49:02] <corwin> well, it matters but it's clear our political enemy in that case.  our goal as free software proponents is to encourage all software to be created as free software.
[19:49:04] <epony> you don't control or participate in the moving source body of the workgroup that handles it..

[19:49:51] *** Joins: AlexS (~Alexander@user/alexs)
[19:49:55] <madage> corwin: I think that's a losing battle, it would be better if we were to focus on getting some shared software base for free computing
[19:50:07] <epony> madage, that is important
[19:50:15] <corwin> madage: isn't that exactly what the GNU project is?
[19:50:21] <kompowiec2> epony, you still haven't explained what it means.
[19:50:23] <epony> independent and sustainable computing that is not profit dependent
[19:50:32] <madage> corwin: yes, and I'm doubling down that
[19:50:54] <epony> kompowiec2, patience, persistence, perseverance
[19:50:55] <madage> don't try to go around making all trash proprietary software change license
[19:51:12] <madage> just focus on what we have and really need
[19:51:14] <corwin> madage: that makes sense, to me.
[19:52:21] <kompowiec2> epony, the facts are you can fork. And if you want him to be successful in the market, you have to put in some effort, that's how business works.
[19:52:37] <corwin> madage: that said, I think re-creating wheels is a key way that people grow as developers and develop ties within the community.  We should avoid discouraging such people, while helping them to select licenses consistent with the values of Free Software.
[19:53:09] <epony> kompowiec2, that's how commerce works: take the work of someone else, resell it, go take the work of someone else, to resell it
[19:53:50] <epony> kompowiec2, then with the money pay a large group of people to control that so small groups are unable to compete with it
[19:54:01] <epony> kompowiec2, the cash the cow
[19:54:12] <kompowiec2> epony, and where is the problem?
[19:54:39] <epony> kompowiec2, not enough cows, too much resellers
[19:54:48] <madage> corwin: I was think on another scenario as in "let's try to make windows/java/photoshop maker change their minds/licenses"
[19:55:00] <kompowiec2> so there is no problem.
[19:55:32] <epony> kompowiec2, which results in monter cows that are not exactly cows but berserker werecows that hunt you
[19:55:52] <kompowiec2> how?
[19:56:01] <epony> surveillance capitalism baby
[19:56:01] <madage> but nonetheless, in the case on the case you mention, I think it's of lesser importance to change solo projects licenses as in making solo developers see the importance of the commons we already have
[19:56:07] <kompowiec2> it doesn't make any sense in case free software
[19:56:27] <madage> we can all make solo/hobby projects and their licenses are not fundamental to our collective freedoms
[19:56:37] <epony> kompowiec2, are you sure, since you're just paying for some software which you "could" but never do fork
[19:57:04] <kompowiec2> epony, if i am satisfied with the software, why would i do it?
[19:57:17] <corwin> madage: I think that's actually a laudable goal but I have a particular view of the "right way" to go about it.  We should create a culture among users where people won't touch software that don't guarantee the four freedoms via clear licensing terms. Only when non-free software is no longer viable commercially will we really be winning.
[19:57:24] *** Joins: vitali64 (~vitali64@user/vitali64)
[19:58:00] <kompowiec2> free software it forms and dies with its community - it cannot be created in any other way. Let freenode be an example ...
[19:59:04] <epony> kompowiec2, institutionalised werecow hunted prey you become with that line of complacency, with the false premise "you can fork it" but you have to pay to get it.. you've lost the independence and sustainability, so you can't compete with any of that, it's been monopolised and hybridised so you have no real source cows conservancy.. you have to start evolutionary again
[20:00:07] <madage> corwin: agreed, this would be crucial. But then again in order to actualy pull that off, I think we need to touch on much more than only software
[20:00:19] <kompowiec2> I do not see this as a problem. If any free software were to give me a problem I would customize it first, if it were too hard I would look for other free software.
[20:00:24] <corwin> madage: point well taken.
[20:00:25] <kompowiec2> like, epony what's the point?
[20:00:39] <epony> ^ that answers your question now..  Mar11 1756<kompowiec2> epony, and what's stopping you from being second oracle linux?
[20:00:47] <kompowiec2> nothing?
[20:01:03] <epony> kompowiec2, unlike you, others track what the discussion is about ;-)
[20:01:52] <labrador> epony, can't you stop being a rude fuck for a second?
[20:02:00] <epony> a lot of people are seeing the inability of the license alone to ensure and preserve most of the freedoms it intended to protect
[20:02:03] <qrpnxz> epony: yeah, red hat generously funded dead-in-the-water leech distro centos which cut into their bottom line many many years. They found a way to make the project actually productive (centos stream, which allows direct contribution to rhel you so so desire), and stop funding dead-weight project
[20:02:06] <corwin> labrador: you are way out of line.
[20:03:06] <labrador> corwin, i just came back and epony is still doing the same thing. And I'm the one who's "OuT oF lInE"
[20:03:13] <kompowiec2> epony, what freedoms
[20:03:25] <epony> so that's the tweak to consider, and it's a long known one, the non-profit detail that levels out the freedoms again, regardless of "prefered" name of license
[20:04:14] <epony> so, think about it, it's not a mandated decision, just a point to be aware of ;-)
[20:04:36] <kompowiec2> as above, what freedoms you mean?
[20:04:38] <corwin> labrador: when I tagged both of you 90m ago what I saw from both of you was rude and showed a lack of respect for the community.  since then epony has been doing well to take their arguments without the ad hom I objected to.  You, on the other hand waded back in with profanity.
[20:04:50] <epony> whether you can or can not expect to continue to receive free software as defined by the "enumerated short list of freedoms"
[20:06:07] <epony> yes, the point is not to insult each other, but to find out "ideas" and "concepts" that solve problems or advance forward thinking and rationale
[20:07:04] <kompowiec2> epony, I'm still curious what freedoms are you talking about, which the FSF may have missed?
[20:07:34] <epony> the other important detail is, who controls the software and its goals and objectives, other than the "non-profit" point
[20:08:21] <epony> if you dedicate some thinking time to it, you'll find out the control and the profit are tightly related
[20:08:48] <kompowiec2> epony, ultimately you cannot full control free software, because you have the right to modify it and adapt it to your needs. This is different from proprietary software.
[20:09:46] <epony> while with non-profit models it's much more approachable since there is organic rather than financial competitive elements that take precedence
[20:09:55] <qrpnxz> kompowiec2: "the facts are you can fork. And if you want him to be successful in the market, you have to put in some effort, that's how business works." Yep and that's what what oracle linux is. They take RHEL, do their own validation and add extra feature (also free software) like their own kernel hotpatching thing and get certifications and all that, then they sell support on it.

[20:12:02] <epony> that is why, the argument about free software being commercial is not a sustainable one, it's a for profit other model, trading and reselling, but not free, and that is the non-price element, which is important to understand, that cost is also a factor on freedoms
[20:12:58] <kompowiec2> the commercialization of free software mainly helps us.
[20:13:36] <epony> helps the businesses, you.. not, their board of directors, you.. are an afterthought, an effect of secondary purpose
[20:13:37] <kompowiec2> because whether they like it or not, they have the resources that will be able to promote them.
[20:13:44] <qrpnxz> >free software with funding is not sustainable

[20:16:29] <epony> remember, for-profit is not independent of freedoms, it's a limiter of these
[20:16:40] <qrpnxz> wrong
[20:17:48] <epony> if it was wrong, why would it make profit when it is freedom delivery and available at no cost?
[20:18:10] <kompowiec2> or are you just making an ambiguity
[20:19:27] <epony> I think you're not paying for your distribution of gnu or linux or bsdd, you get it from a non-profit organisation or distributor or the source direct and you have a relative expectation of known freedoms
[20:20:14] <epony> now why would you expect these same freedoms for a for profit reseller and repackager of these, while you can get it for freedom expectation at non-profit original authoring group?
[20:20:28] *** Quits: PCITechie (~aiden@fsf/member/PCITechie) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[20:20:28] <qrpnxz> red hat make money from support, not from restricting any software freedom. You get the important patches you need directly from the author as soon as possible, you get a knowledge base, you get to call a person that knows what's up 24x7, that's what you get from red hat. Others are free to copy what red hat release, but necessarily they will not be as fast because red hat is the one releasin
[20:20:30] <qrpnxz> g it. If you file a bug with rocky, you aren't gonna have red hat engineers working to fix it automatically, because their priority if paying customer
[20:20:54] <epony> why is the software defect in there then?
[20:21:10] <epony> and why is it not included in the non-profit software authoring groups releases?
[20:21:12] <qrpnxz> there's always defects, _all software has bugs period_
[20:21:16] <kompowiec2> i think that qrpnxz exhausted the topic
[20:21:19] <kompowiec2> :)
[20:21:28] <qrpnxz> you have to demonstrate that it's defective by design, otherwise you have no case
[20:21:31] *** Joins: PCITechie (~aiden@fsf/member/PCITechie)
[20:21:48] <qrpnxz> it is included in the non-profit releases!
[20:22:29] <epony> I kind of proved it, it's for profit, therefore it has less freedoms by which it guarantees the control and dominant relation, which propagates the defects ensuring propagation of that relation.
[20:22:44] <epony> it's a well understood cause and resultant effect in software
[20:22:50] <qrpnxz> for profit therefore not free is not an argument. That does not follow
[20:22:57] <epony> it does
[20:23:02] <qrpnxz> it doesn't
[20:23:52] <qrpnxz> if i you pay me to make you an app, the fact that you paid me had no bearing on whether it was free software or not. If i release it to you under GPL with source code, it's free. If i gave you proprietary binary only it was non-free. The fact that you paid me for that work had no bearing
[20:23:58] <epony> for profit is reduced quality and/or freedom so you can't replace it and remove the non-free or freedom limitations
[20:24:23] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o craigt
[20:24:37] <qrpnxz> to start with, there are no non-free parts of RHEL to begin with, and yes, you can remove anything you don't like
[20:25:59] <epony> popular distribution comparison web sites rate other more free distributions from non-profit organisation much higher in popularity and installations
[20:26:56] <qrpnxz> debian being more popular has no bearing on rhel freedom status
[20:27:00] <epony> that's just one other indication of "preference" and "affinity" of the public towards freedoms and non-profit release groups
[20:27:20] <qrpnxz> many non-free distro are far far more popular than say, trisquel
[20:27:31] <epony> it's also not a recent trend, has been like that since the 80ies
[20:27:54] <qrpnxz> gratis distros are obviously going to me popular as well
[20:28:11] <qrpnxz> by virtue of being readily available
[20:28:27] <potatoxel[m]> how to make a public rsync thing
[20:28:41] <epony> for example price of postage BSD UNIX was much more popular than commercial AT&T UNIX

[20:29:49] <PCITechie> epony: popularity has nothing to do with freedom. ubuntu is popular, but is a largely nonfree mess. debian is also popular, and is mainly free. (sorry if thats not what you are saying, but it looks like it is)

[23:07:51] <fsbot> System.out.println("Sugeng siang, Noisytoot!")
[23:08:15] <qrpnxz> Yeah, the most depended on packages are all MIT. On the OS distribution side, the OS project like Fedora and Debian help us have a free distribution by doing the package management and having those packages be free. The standard way to get a package is from a group with interest in serving only free software. Hence even though say a 1/3 or 2/3 of packages are permissively licensed, we still g
[23:08:17] <qrpnxz> et the source, because that's a project directive.
[23:08:23] <qrpnxz> To draw a line from that to the world wide web, the browser distribution must filter out the non-free software. IceCat gives us that. But after that it totally breaks down. There are no neat packages. If a site like peertube is serving js blobs, can you trust that even though it's free software? Often even with the source, not really because you cannot yourself build the blobs. (You need Corr
[23:08:25] <qrpnxz> esponding Source to do that. Thanks GPL!)
[23:08:29] <qrpnxz> There's also a lack of freedom of modification to suit your purposes because it is difficult for a user to replace the script that is served with the modified version to execute instead. Besides, the webmaster can update at any time and move stuff around. The dynamically web-loaded, hot-patched architecture of web pages is simply very incompatible with user freedom. It seems to me the best wa
[23:08:31] <qrpnxz> y to do an ethical javascript browser web application is to create a browser extension. That is a self-contained, bit-for-bit reproducible, optionally-upgradable work that is most compatible with user freedom.
[23:08:33] <qrpnxz> Outside of that context, web pages should stick to purely informational display, with very little if any javascript. That is, perhaps weblabels is not even really a worthy goal, since that's still not really free. The focus rather ought to be that informational pages be accessible with no javascript, and applications be ported to an extension or to the desktop, where licensing and user freedo
[23:08:35] <qrpnxz> ms are practical and well-understood. Javascript on regular pages ought to be blocked as much as possible.  (Even when it's freely licensed because it can trivially harm you with little recourse.)
