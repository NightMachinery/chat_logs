[00:23:30] <rhombus> Do I provide an absolute path here? The examples all have "/static/". Surely that's not in the root filesystem, is it?
[00:24:13] <rhombus> Sorry, that was STATIC_URL I was referring to.
[00:28:20] <rhombus> moldy: yesterday you said I had to run 'collectstatic'. But I already have static files in BASEDIR/static.
[00:30:18] <moldy> rhombus: yes, but you want copies of them in STATIC_ROOT
[00:31:03] <moldy> (assuming BASE_DIR/static is not your STATIC_ROOT)
[00:31:16] <rhombus> moldy: STATIC_ROOT is BASEDIR/static -- the copies are already there...
[00:31:29] <moldy> the purpose of collectstatic is to collect the files from your various static dirs (you typically have more than one) and copy them all to STATIC_ROOT
[00:31:39] <moldy> rhombus: then i ask myself how they ended up in there :)
[00:32:06] <moldy> did you use the same value for STATIC_ROOT and STATICFILES_DIRS? you should not
[00:32:21] <rhombus> moldy: again, this is an existing structure, part of a git repo. Somebody else prepared it.
[00:32:32] <rhombus> moldy: let me check STATICFILES_DIRS
[00:33:02] <moldy> well i don't what that somebody else did, or why :)

[08:57:07] <Guest50> Hi I am trying to figure out why this link I am generating with a token does not automatically expire after successfully submitting the form contained in that link. https://dpaste.org/4hEU
[08:57:31] <Guest50> I think it has something to do with passing in the email into the URL
[08:58:04] <Guest50> But I do not know of another way to do this - all I am trying to do is allow users to change their email address
[09:00:07] <Guest50> It works in changing the email address but the token does not expire after using it. When I use pretty much identical code for signup email verifications, the token expires after  successfully submitting the form contained within. But the difference in the signup code is that I am not passing in an email into the URL
[09:02:29] <Guest50> the PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT works for expiration so that has nothing to do with it
[09:03:20] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)

[16:16:25] *** GinF is now known as GinFuyou
[16:17:10] <GinFuyou> I've used to run uwsgi installed system-wide before for emperor mode, but now I'd just setup it in separate venv or something
[16:17:16] <rhombus> GinF There is a tutorial in the uwsgi documentation that has that as a late step.
[16:17:43] <rhombus> GinFuyou: and your approach seems entirely logical to me.
[16:18:12] <rhombus> (I've noticed that the uwsgi documentation isn't great.)
[16:18:52] <GinFuyou> It's a bit messy. Anyway it should work both ways, by typically it's recommended to install all python things in a venv
[16:19:19] <GinFuyou> to keep it separate from python requirements of OS
[16:19:43] <rhombus> GinFuyou: right, that makes sense to me, and it's how I prefer it.

[16:34:24] <doismellburning> rhombus: I've worked in places that used system packages as much as possible, to benefit from distro-level support; it's not a strategy I've generally adopted myself, but it's one I can appreciate
[16:34:56] <rhombus> doismellburning: sure, I get that.

[23:45:54] <hzm74> Hello, i have a question: what is the right way to set up a model for the following scenario:
[23:47:40] <hzm74> I need a database that contains documents. So one model holds the documentname, name of the company the document belongs to etc. Another model holds the date of the document.
[23:49:24] <hzm74> But a document can have multiple dates (revisions), So the model has a manytomany relationship with document and dates. A date can have multiple documents and a document can have multiple dates.
[23:50:36] <hzm74> I have the model set up like this: http://dpaste.org/joV8
[23:52:30] <hzm74> But my problem is the dates-model grows too fast. Because with each revision of a document i need to create a new date-record,
[23:54:12] <hzm74> When 2 documents each need a new date (like 2022-01-23), this date is created two times.
[23:55:06] <hzm74> Is this the right way to set up a model for registering documents with different revision-dates?
