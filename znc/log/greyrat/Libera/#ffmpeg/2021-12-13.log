[00:36:05] <hat_wearer> I have many audio files I need to  process with  ffmpeg, but they are all of the same format. How can I determine the minimal set of components I need to compile ffmpeg with in order to process the files? I've tried disabling demuxers/muxers/filters/etc but I end up with an error  like "Invalid data in input".

[02:37:46] <usermon> hat_wearer: what cmd you running?
[02:37:58] <usermon> are you just trying to concatenate all the files? or apply a specific filter to each file?
[02:42:15] <hat_wearer> usermon: The command im running uses some filters, which I have included using the --enable-filter= flag when running ./configure before build. Specifically: amix,amerge,volume,copy,drawtext.
[02:42:45] <hat_wearer> But even using ffprobe on an input file (a pcm encoded wav file) will return the "Invalid value" error. So I suspect I am missing a decoder, demuxer, parser or  something
[02:43:16] <hat_wearer> Essentially I'm trying to narrow down which component specifically im missing
[02:53:08] <usermon> maybe you might have to specifically specify you have pcm as input...

[13:19:16] <furq> depends whether you're going from text to bitmap or bitmap to text
[13:19:30] <furq> or whether you want to do that
[13:20:07] <Kingsy> furq: I just want to copy the subtitle unchanged.
[13:20:13] <furq> use -c:s copy then
[13:20:35] <Kingsy> furq: how can I "copy" only the first stream?
[13:21:18] <furq> -map
[13:21:26] <Kingsy> thats what I am doing.
[13:21:30] <Kingsy> moment I'll paste my line

[13:22:27] <furq> that will only map the first subtitle stream
[13:22:36] <Kingsy> I think that'll work
[13:22:40] <furq> yeah
[13:22:43] <furq> you just need -c:s copy
[13:22:51] <Kingsy> okie let me try.
[13:23:12] <furq> also -movflags faststart doesn't do anything for mkv

[14:02:25] <jbartu> I am change ssa to srt for compatibility problems, but when I do this, the subtitle resolution is huge (all the screen). How can I change fontsize (if is possible) in this script please?
[14:02:25] <jbartu> ffmpeg -y -i "$i" -metadata title="" -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:s -c copy -c:s srt "/path output/${i%.*}.mkv"
[14:03:34] <jbartu> Is not external srt, is inside of mkv.
[14:05:50] <furq> that's up to your player
[14:05:57] <furq> srt is just plain text

[17:44:28] <haasn> it's weird that leftovers from a previous build would affect the current build at all
[17:44:36] <haasn> in any sane build system this is not the case

[18:48:46] <ravioli> heyo. i'm looking to optimize this, to make it faster. it scrolls a 33577x2048 png to the left once per frame.
[18:49:01] <ravioli> ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -r 90 -i input.png -vf crop=3840:2048:n:0 -frames:v 33577 -pix_fmt yuv420p -preset fast -r 90 output.mp4
[18:49:38] <ravioli> this command can take like 35 or 40 minutes.
[18:52:07] <DHE> sounds about right for a nigh-4k video stream. but on that note, a 90 fps 4k video stream is quite a bit...

[18:53:38] <DHE> what I would suggest trying is use the fps filter to turn a 1fps input video into 90 fps in the filter pipeline before the crop command has its processing job
[18:54:26] <DHE> also on the input side use -framerate instead of -r to set the requested input framerate

[18:55:45] <ravioli> the 90fps is me just trying to specify how fast the image should scroll to the left. 30fps gives me a slower scroll, but a faster scroll looks better for what i'm doing.
[18:57:33] <ravioli> DHE: so do you mean something like... ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -framerate 90 -i input.png -fps 90 -vf crop=3840:2048:n:0 -frames:v 33577 -pix_fmt yuv420p -preset fast -r 90 output.mp4
[18:57:39] <DHE> point is I think a big part of your performance problems is actually the image loading. I'm not sure how much though. the solution is to load the image less often and have the fps filter perform frame duplication
[18:58:13] <DHE> more like: ffmpeg -loop 1 -framerate 1 -i input.png -vf fps=90,crop=3840:2048:n:0 -frames:v 33577 -pix_fmt yuv420p -preset fast  output.mp4
[18:58:28] <ravioli> ooh
[18:58:29] <DHE> I'm making this up as I go and I'm not 100% sure on this, so if I've made a mistake, feel free to fix it
[19:00:58] <ravioli> thank you, i'm gonna give it a shot.

[20:03:51] <kepstin> if you're only looping a single frame, the loop filter is better than the loop input option
[20:04:09] <kepstin> since it just stores the frame in memory and duplicates it without reloading it
[20:04:48] <ravioli> so what i'm trying to do is use showspectrumpic to create a big spectrograph. then scroll that image with the audio. it looks better than the native showspectrum thing.
[20:05:24] <ravioli> right now i'm using four commands: one to create the spectrumpic, then one to pad the beginning, then one to create the video with no audio, then one to overlay the audio
[20:05:42] <ravioli> right now i've consolidated the first two into one. the thing that takes up time is the creation of the video with no audio.
[20:05:50] <ravioli> i'm wondering if there's a way to combine these two commands into one: https://pastebin.com/uMs5BmjR
[20:06:46] <kepstin> there's no way to combine the generation of the full song spectrum picture and generating the final video into a single ffmpeg command
[20:06:52] <ravioli> i've tried a few ways but i can't seem to get video out. and my googles are failing me.
[20:06:56] <kepstin> but you can significantly speed up the generation of the video
[20:06:59] <ravioli> ah, ok. that makes me feel a little less insane.
[20:07:04] <ravioli> o?
[20:07:17] <kepstin> as i said, use the loop filter instead of loop input option
[20:07:58] <ravioli> ooooh
[20:08:05] <DHE> ah, didn't know that existed
[20:08:23] <DHE> I was trying to use the FPS filter to fake one, making it duplicate the frame in increments of 90
[20:08:25] <kepstin> well, it's always gonna be kinda slow since you're encoding a 4k video. but that'll remove the overhead of re-reading the input image over and over again.
[20:09:47] <kepstin> (you should stick an addtional fps= filter after the crop filter to reduce the number of frames that need to be encoded. Consider 60 if smooth movement is important, or something around 30 or so to speed up encoding a lot)
[20:22:38] <ravioli> so, putting "loop=-1:size=1:start=0" in the beginning of the -vf works, but it keeps going on for infinity instead of ending at the end of the image. using
[20:23:10] <ravioli> using "1" instead of "-1" makes stops the video after 1 second.
[20:26:45] <kepstin> strange, the '-frames:v' option should still be taking care of that  - although if you changed the output framerate, the number of frames you need to set changes - consider using the "-t" option to set the duration in seconds instead, or the -shortest option to have ffmpeg cut the video when the audio ends.

[23:06:54] <aphysically> I'd have to experiment more to determine exactly what causes it to choke out, but I suspect maximum over a 6 second moving window would be fine
[23:10:14] <ChocolateArmpits> djk, what's the video source? is it a file or something else?
[23:11:29] <djk> tcp stream using cvlc at the moment may try to change to rtp
[23:12:22] <ChocolateArmpits> djk, is the sync between the video and audio important?
[23:12:45] <djk> at the moment no
[23:13:03] <djk> just getting audio that near to the video is good
[23:13:53] <ChocolateArmpits> are both sources realtime?

[23:15:09] <djk> yes
[23:15:14] <ChocolateArmpits> ok so it's pretty simple ffmpeg -i tcp://video -i http://audio -map 0:v -map 1:a -vcodec libx264 -acodec aac -f flv rtmp:\\youtubeurl\youtube-key

[23:16:09] <ChocolateArmpits> get the youtube url from the broadcast manager page

[23:17:16] <cryptic> (I asked this a few days ago, but I'll try again) -- I'm trying to preserve the most recent 60 minutes of a live camera feed accessible over https via an .m3u8 'playlist' file that references another .m3u8 'chunklist' file that points to the three most recent .ts files. I was thinking about using ffmpeg's hls demuxer on the input (with the default options) and the hls muxer on the output with hls_start_number_source=generic,
[23:17:16] <cryptic> hls_time=10, hls_list_size=360, hls_delete_threshold=30 and hls_flags=delete_segments+program_date_time+second_level_segment_index+omit_endlist+discont_start, which works just fine. However, this might not be practical, because I really don't need the output m3u8 file to exist until an external event is reported to trigger persistent storage of the exact data downloaded from the server. Due to reliability issues with the input source,
[23:17:16] <cryptic> I'm thinking it might just be better to use python to parse the input m3u8 files, download new .ts files, handle the myriad HTTP errors that will arise, and (when signaled via the occurrence of a specific event) use ffmpeg to concatenate the ephemerally stored .ts input files into a persistently stored mp4 output file. Does that sound reasonable?
[23:17:17] <djk> This is what I have that works for nullaudio.
[23:17:20] <djk>  /usr/bin/ffmpeg     -loglevel level+warning     -thread_queue_size 512     -framerate 30     -f x11grab     -s 1920x1080     -probesize 42M     -i :0.0+1024,0     -f lavfi     -i anullsrc     -c:v libx264     -pix_fmt yuv420p     -g 60     -b:v 2500k     -c:a libmp3lame     -ar 44100     -b:a 32k     -preset ultrafast     -maxrate 5000k     -bufsize 2500k     -preset ultrafast     -flvflags no_duration_filesize      -f flv "rtmp
[23:19:01] <djk> replacing the anullsrc with the url return no such filter
[23:19:20] <ChocolateArmpits> djk, remove '-f lavfi'
[23:19:41] <ChocolateArmpits> otherwise ffmpeg tries to parse the input as a lavfi filter
[23:22:10] <djk> I need a dummy's guide on ffmpeg ;-)

[23:29:47] <jbartu> Hi there!
[23:29:47] <jbartu> How can I add srt subs into video?
[23:29:48] <jbartu> I have a folder with multiple videos and 2 subs per video. Everyone have name.mkv and name01.srt name02.srt.
[23:29:48] <jbartu> The script I using is this, but not work
[23:29:49] <jbartu> Sorry it's pasted like link. Is with #ffmpeg but becouse I was trying diferents
[23:30:41] <jbartu> Sorry, I am a mass.. if do not understand, tell me please
[23:32:05] <cryptic> jbartu: do you want them burned into the video or as a track that can be enabled/disabled?
[23:32:36] <cryptic> if the former: ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -vf subtitles=subtitles.srt out.mp4
[23:32:54] <cryptic> if the latter: ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -c copy -c:s mov_text out.mp4
[23:33:48] <jbartu> cryptic thanks for answer.
[23:33:49] <jbartu> I do not want to burn, just add to into mkv
[23:34:06] <jbartu> as a track
[23:34:25] <cryptic> you *should* be able to add multiple subtitle tracks with -i sub1.srt -i sub2.srt. Give it a try & see what happens
[23:36:11] <jbartu> Then, was wrong here?
[23:36:12] <jbartu> for f in *.mkv; do if [ -f "${f%.*}01.srt" ];[ -f "${f%.*}02.srt" ]; then  ffmpeg -i "$f" -i "${f%.*}01.srt" -map 0 -map 1 -c copy "path/${f}" fi done
[23:38:08] <kepstin> you're only adding the initial input file and one of the subtitle streams. you need to add another -i option with the third input (second subtitle stream), and another -map option to copy the second subtitle stream to the output.

[23:50:29] <ChocolateArmpits> cryptic, have you thought about using the segmeter to store temporary files?
[23:51:08] <cryptic> ChocolateArmpits: that's what this does. The HLS demuxer actually provides somewhat more control than the segmenter, if I recall correctly
[23:51:46] <ChocolateArmpits> yes it does, but segmenter doesn't produce a manifest or a playlist, so it's just the segments
[23:52:01] *** Joins: taupiqueur (~taupiqueu@64.197.204.77.rev.sfr.net)
[23:52:02] <cryptic> It's literally what's downloaded from the server?
[23:52:51] <ChocolateArmpits> well, ffmpeg will parse the stream in full and then segment it, so the segments won't be made in accordance of how they are laid out in the server
[23:53:42] <cryptic> if I don't want it to parse the stream in full before segmenting it, then would my proposed solution be appropriate?
[23:55:01] <ChocolateArmpits> what I meant in full is that the output segments won't start or have the same duration as what the server has
[23:56:16] <cryptic> Right, the output segments will default to 2s, but the server tries for roughly 10s segments
[23:59:47] <ChocolateArmpits> imo I'd just use the segmenter but have signifcantly longer durations
