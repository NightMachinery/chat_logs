[01:21:28] <MrMobius> the other crazy thing is that the css class i defined with that font is applied to 4 different <p> objects and i only have to put placeholder text for one and then it selects the font correctly for the other 3. does it skip evaluating the CSS if <p></p> is empty?

[02:06:55] <hmw[at]> What problem am I looking for?
[02:07:59] <hmw[at]> Looks good except for a few rounding errors
[02:08:23] <orbisvicis> when I run this in my browser the charts/canvas always overflow, so that they're not centered and cut off
[02:08:30] <orbisvicis> of course, it seems to work fine in the fiddle
[02:08:51] <orbisvicis> but for now, just imagine the charts are overflowing to the right
[02:09:42] <hmw[at]> ah ok
[02:09:58] <hmw[at]> well, if it works in the fiddle, then something that is added on your real page must be interfering, right?
[02:10:12] <hmw[at]> I can't help a lot, if the example is not broken, obviously
[02:10:53] <hmw[at]> Generic hint: Remove stuff from your broken page (using the inspector and "delete node" or similar) and hope, that removing something results in the error vanishing. Then work from there.
[02:11:25] <hmw[at]> that looks like a tricky layout tbh
[02:12:02] <orbisvicis> hmw[at]: the documentation for Vega mentioned that the canvas usually overflows
[02:12:08] <orbisvicis> https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/size.html#autosize
[02:12:11] <orbisvicis> also, my page is the same
[02:12:31] <hmw[at]> I can't hunt for a bug that is not in my browser :(
[02:12:37] <hmw[at]> also, wtf. Why would it overflow.
[02:13:03] <sbrothy> I'm in this strange situation where my browsers (both firefox and chrome on ubuntu) exhibit the same behaviour. I have a css file where I define styles like ".somestyle { border: 5px solid #f5b041; }" and when I use that in an html page with a "<div id="somestyle.." i get the behaviour i expect but with <div class="somestyle..." i get extra boxes (?!) is my system broken?
[02:13:17] <orbisvicis> apparently when they build the chart, adding some final elements increases the canvas size past the target
[02:14:03] <orbisvicis> hmw[at], anyway, let me see if i can trigger the overflow
[02:15:14] <hmw[at]> sbrothy: Most of the time it is the coder. Sometimes the browsers just crash and need a restart (seems not to be the case when it happens in both browsers). Browser bugs occur, although rarely.

[02:15:41] <sbrothy> yeh thats hwat left me flabbergasted. ill revisit this tomorrow. nvm.
[02:15:57] <sbrothy> its probably me
[02:16:27] <hmw[at]> orbisvicis: I assume you tried that "resize" = "true" thing already?
[02:17:31] <hmw[at]> orbisvicis: What happens if you add a button that triggers that view.resize() call? Does it fix the overflow?
[02:18:10] <hmw[at]> sbrothy: I am curious to see a screenshot of those "extra boxes"
[02:18:29] <orbisvicis> heh no b/c the initial view is cutoff but setting resize=true is worth a shot
[02:19:14] <hmw[at]> sbrothy: Note: Having a rule for a class in CSS as in .theclass will not apply to an element with an ID of the same name. If I read your initial post correctly, changing the element from <div class> to <div id> would cause the rule to NOT being applied anymore.

[02:23:58] <sbrothy> thx tho
[02:23:58] <hmw[at]> orbisvicis: Cool!
[02:24:00] <orbisvicis> and ^^ that's with resize=true
[02:24:13] <hmw[at]> sbrothy: Sure. Going for a walk or sleeping over such things can help. CSS is nasty at times.
[02:24:22] <sbrothy> indeed
[02:24:28] <orbisvicis> ok let me explain my CSS fixes:
[02:25:44] <orbisvicis> 1. there's a button in the top right of each chart defined by the padding of .vega-vis which is within my position&size div, ".test"
[02:25:55] <orbisvicis> that button should be inside and to the right of ".test"
[02:26:14] <orbisvicis> anyway, that happens automatically with width: 100%
[02:27:31] <hmw[at]> orbisvicis: Theory: You use 125% to make the canvas wider. It might be just a miscalculation. Maybe you'd fare better to use width:calc(100% + <thepadding>px) or something alike
[02:28:09] *** Parts: MrMobius (~MrMobius@pool-108-31-243-125.washdc.fios.verizon.net) (Leaving)
[02:29:07] <orbisvicis> 2. the chart (".marks) should be centered within ".test" or ".vega-vis) (they have the same size/position) but not cutoff but there's the annoying ".chart-wrapper" between ".vega-vis" and ".marks"
[02:30:39] <orbisvicis> so I remove ".chart-wrapper" from the flow with position:absolute. Turns out the ".marks" needs the parent to have a width (or nothing draws), so I add width:100%
[02:31:04] <orbisvicis> hmw[at], that 125% doesn't do anything, I added it when I couldnt trigger the overflow, and I forgot to remove it
[02:31:25] <orbisvicis> hmw[at], so those are my workarounds to have the chart centered and the button to the right
[02:31:30] <orbisvicis> but that leads to my final problem
[02:32:08] <orbisvicis> ".chart-wrapper" is used to determine the size of the chart, but because it is absolute and now includes the parent padding, the chart is WAY too big
[02:33:04] <orbisvicis> so I need ".chart-wrapper" to have the same size as ".vega-vis"
[02:33:07] <orbisvicis> phew
[02:35:35] <orbisvicis> ie width of ".chart-wrapper" -= "padding-right" of ".vega-vis"
[02:36:20] <orbisvicis> either that or some way to center  ".marks" without making ".chart-wrapper" position:absolute
[02:39:52] <hmw[at]> My head is spinning. I have to give up :(
[02:40:57] <orbisvicis> ok :(
[02:45:58] <orbisvicis> anyway that's why I have https://jsfiddle.net/r2fawj4c/4/

[11:48:30] <Jaami> Hi, i am stuck on how to position elements on my page. the first thing i need to ask is that. do a page always have 12 rows or it depends on how i write css?
[11:49:02] <[twisti]> rows ?
[11:49:34] <Jaami> yes, rows or may be columns whatever. actually, i dont even know if i am dealing with flex, grid or something else?
[11:50:05] <Jaami> lets say i have just a blank page to fill up with elements. where do istart from?
[11:50:52] <Jaami> can figure out what is my problem?
[11:51:03] <Jaami> can you ***?
[11:51:45] <Jaami> Do i have to decide either i want my page as a grid or as a flex?
[11:52:26] <Jaami> can someone get me out of confusing concepts of CSS?
[11:53:11] <Jaami> [twisti] could you please spare few minutes?
[11:53:17] <gry> Jaami pages do not always have 12 rows
[11:53:34] <Jaami> oh thanks a lot for resp[onding gry

[11:54:12] <[twisti]> Jaami: its generally very unhelpful to trigger specific people. i for one didnt even know css could have a grid without an html table. i know practically nothing about css. i can help you if you have questions about how to set a color
[11:54:36] <[twisti]> im here because i was looking for help too
[11:54:52] <Jaami> :)
[11:54:55] <gry> a page is like this https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/introduction.html#a-quick-introduction-to-html
[11:55:02] <gry> take a look
[11:55:15] <gry> there are various elements, no grid
[11:55:18] <hassoon> 'morning
[11:55:21] <gry> not by default
[11:55:51] <Jaami> i will take a look at this link. gry please just let me ask you
[11:56:22] <Jaami> i have been reading a lot but look like i have something very wrong in my mind which i need to clear
[11:56:27] <gry> go ahead
[11:57:19] *** Joins: jazzy (~jaziz@user/jaziz)
[11:57:35] <Jaami> a blank page at very begining has something like rows golumns or grid or anything like flex etc. which i have to use or is it my choice to use any of those where i need?
[11:58:46] <Jaami> just to save time, i am trying to type as fast as possible, please ignore my spelling mistakes
[11:59:10] *** Joins: a-865 (~fmcz@24.50.25.135)
[12:02:15] <Jaami> actually, i started learning Svelte and Svelte Kit, i think difference is that Svelte is for webapps and Sveltekit is for mobile aps. can you tell me what CSS styles both follow
[12:02:52] *** Joins: BaggersIO (~BaggersIO@2a02:810d:983f:b088:55e5:fdfd:ed49:6a99)
[12:03:50] <Jaami> After reading many pages on internet about CSS, i know basic structre and many attributes. also i know how to apply different styles on an element.
[12:04:44] <Jaami> the real problem for me is to decide either i need grid or flex or anything like that?
[12:05:28] <Jaami> do i need to get rid of all that and go with material UI framework?
[12:06:53] <Jaami> Thanks
[12:08:45] <gry> Jaami: a blank page has only <body></body>
[12:08:47] <gry> no grid
[12:09:25] <gry> if you have a framework then you get a grid
[12:09:34] <gry> depends on framework
[12:12:22] <Jaami> oh , depends on framework.
[12:13:32] <gry> what framework have you got ?
[12:14:04] <Jaami> i started Svelte + SvelteKit
[12:14:50] <Jaami> Svelte is for webapps and SvelteKit for mobile. i dont know the UI difference between the two.
[12:17:07] <Jaami> Svelte let me apply the <style> the way i want.i gues i can use grid, flex or whatever but i dont know what experienced designers use
[12:19:01] <Jaami> Svelte let me use material UI framework but itself its not a UI framework
[12:19:17] <Jaami> That is what i think

[22:45:18] <BinarySavior> When creating a document with subsections and indentation to differentiate between each subsection, i have used 10px
[22:45:47] <BinarySavior> sorry, margin + padding totaling 18 px
[22:46:33] <BinarySavior> it looks good, but as window width decreases and horizontal space becomes more valuable, I want to do less indenting because the ratio of empty space to text becomes much larger as the screen width lessens
[22:46:48] <BinarySavior> should I use vh units?
[22:46:52] <BinarySavior> I mean vw
[22:56:33] <matsaman> no harm in trying
[22:56:46] <matsaman> otherwise you could simply make a new @media rule for the dimensional range you're focused on

[23:20:01] <adsc> So how do we deal with long contents in table cells? I've seen some older pages just setting max-width and specifying overflow:hidden, then put the full content in the title tag, but the title tag doesn't work in mobile browsers.
[23:21:40] <adsc> My context is a table of contacts with lots of fields like name, email, phone, etc., and some text data from textarea inputs for each contact

[23:27:00] <matsaman> overflow is the way
[23:27:31] <adsc> that is very unspecific
[23:28:07] <matsaman> as you said, set a width, set overflow
[23:28:11] <matsaman> although I'd set auto and not hidden
[23:28:26] <adsc> auto makes it overwrite the next cell in fifo
[23:28:47] <matsaman> sounds like you have a specific problem, got some code?
[23:29:07] <adsc> let me try to whip up an example
[23:32:11] <adsc> https://jsfiddle.net/4p0cjf3o/
[23:34:12] <matsaman> sure sure
[23:34:16] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[23:34:19] <matsaman> you have to wrap the contents of the cell in another element
[23:34:23] <matsaman> like a div
[23:35:09] <adsc> ok, let me try
[23:35:10] <matsaman> <td><div class="cell">Long text that will overflow the defined width of the cell.</div></td>
[23:35:38] <matsaman> or you could do overflow: scroll; and always indicate a potential for scrolling

[23:41:22] <adsc> hmmm, yeah, it's a way, I guess
[23:41:30] <adsc> but all those scrollbars look pretty horrible
[23:42:49] <adsc> I guess I could still use the title tag and use overflow:hidden on desktop and overflow:scroll on mobile

[23:43:20] <adsc> there is no modern replacement for title attribute?
[23:43:38] <adsc> like a tooltip that is displayed on mobile when an element is tapped?

[23:44:28] <FunkyBob> adsc: title doesn't still work?
[23:44:37] <adsc> it works, but not on mobile
[23:44:50] <FunkyBob> possibly one of the aria attributes
[23:45:25] <adsc> ideally, on mobile, I could tap the element and it would display the full content of the cell

[23:46:45] <matsaman> you could use JS for that
[23:46:59] *** Joins: PenguinMan98 (~PenguinMa@65.153.38.250)
[23:47:23] <adsc> yeah, something like popper.js
[23:47:49] <matsaman> or you could play with altering the 'display' values of the table/tr/th/td elements
[23:47:55] <matsaman> don't think I would bother, though
[23:48:04] <matsaman> what makes tables great is that they're tables
[23:48:14] <matsaman> if your data is more consumable in not-a-table, then you shouldn't be using a table in the first place
[23:48:25] <matsaman> handheld devices are another problem
[23:48:36] <matsaman> you can scroll, you can rotate and force landscape, you can reduce text/size
[23:49:28] <adsc> it probably won't be used much on small screens, it's an admin tool
[23:49:52] <adsc> but still, I imagine other people do have that problem

[23:50:30] <adsc> but there is only so much you can do with small screens
[23:50:36] <matsaman> well you can break it up, then
[23:50:38] <matsaman> list of users
[23:50:40] <matsaman> click on a user
[23:50:50] <adsc> yeah, for more details
[23:50:53] <matsaman> list of things you can view/edit, possibly with truncated output (overflow again)
[23:51:03] <matsaman> I wouldn't do that just for mobile vs desktop, though
[23:51:23] <matsaman> I would do it for all or none
[23:51:33] <matsaman> you don't want to be maintaining so many versions of a thing
[23:52:08] <adsc> could maybe also use expand/collapse for longer fields
[23:54:45] <FunkyBob> oh, i missed... is this specifically for table cells?
[23:54:51] <adsc> yeah
[23:55:07] <adsc> like a contacts table with some fields that contain text from a textarea
[23:55:30] <adsc> which are usually empty, but sometimes contain long texts
[23:58:52] <FunkyBob> wonder if y ou could do something with summary+details elements
