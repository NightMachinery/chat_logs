[20:11:47] <noex> is there an easy way to whitelist java script on a per-domain basis? obviously, you can do it manually through the config, but doing that every time is tedious. i could probably write a python function to create a dict and bind it to a hotkey or something, but wasn't sure if something like that already existed.
[20:14:48] <guido> noex: press tSh

[22:00:23] <Maxxxed69> noex: Would you know of a way where I can yank a url from a hint and have in the same bind it spit the url into a image viewer, nomacs?
[22:01:58] <noex> i imagine there's a way to probably do that with xdg-open. i assume if your xdg image viewer handler is set to feh, you can probably just open the images somehow.  not really sure though, just a guess.
[22:03:26] <noex> Maxxxed69: you probably want to use feh to open the URL directly right, not download and then open
[22:04:21] <noex> i guess that is what you said.  sorry, can't read apparently.

[22:13:36] <Maxxxed69> Or, if possible, can I hint a file/image/gif to open in feh?
[22:15:09] <noex> i'm not even sure how to just open an image directly. i can hint them, but if i select one it follows the link.
[22:15:26] <noex> with ;i and ;I
[22:17:18] <noex> i'm still learning myself
[22:19:46] <Maxxxed69> ;i ;I how do you use that?
[22:23:25] <noex> if you type it in normal mode it will hint images
[22:23:38] <noex> but selecting one will follow the image link, which is not really what you want
[22:24:50] <Maxxxed69> What do you mean normal mode?
[22:25:21] <Maxxxed69> i got it
[22:26:06] <noex> yeah, pressing escape will always put you into "normal mode" and i puts you into "insert mode" (there are other modes actually, but those are the most frequently used)
[22:26:52] <Maxxxed69> Goodness that is cool
[22:28:09] <Maxxxed69> hint all yank, I can get the url I want, now I just need to figure out a way to pipe it into feh
