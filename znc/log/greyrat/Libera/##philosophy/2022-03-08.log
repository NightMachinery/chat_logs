[00:23:47] <causative_> it is primarily a defensive alliance, and furthermore, more importantly, the reason Ukraine was trying to join was so it would be defended
[00:24:01] <Ungwelian> "What is striking about the Yugoslav conflict, given the level of intense media coverage and public interest it has received in the United States and abroad,

[00:27:43] <Ungwelian> And NATO bombed Libya too.
[00:28:09] <Ungwelian> Which NATO country had Libya invaded ?
[00:28:24] <causative_> why is Russia afraid of Ukraine joining NATO, when Estonia and Latvia border Russia and are already in NATO?
[00:28:40] <causative_> and Russia has said not a word about them
[00:29:14] <causative_> I don't know why you're asking me who Libya had invaded, maybe you misread something I said
[00:29:14] <Ungwelian> Ukraine is a very large country, and significantly to the east of both Estonia and Latvia.
[00:29:43] <causative_> yeah and more significantly Russia already has been conducting military campaigns in Ukraine and has annexed territory from them
[00:30:04] <causative_> Russia was never afraid of being invaded by NATO, they were afraid that NATO would stop them from doing exactly what Russia is doing now, i.e. invading Ukraine
[00:30:17] <causative_> this is so obvious I don't know how you can think differently
[00:30:17] <AStolypina> Крым - НАШ!

[00:31:17] <xx> russia is much stronger now
[00:31:43] <xx> plus at least the baltics did not announce at any point that they intend to take some land back with the help of NATO
[00:31:46] <AStolypina> My recommendation is for Russia to bring back the Warsaw Pact - and invite Mexico and Cuba to join it.
[00:31:54] <AStolypina> Two nations with a history of being invaded by the United States.
[00:31:58] <xx> while ukraine said they'd take back crimea at any cost, including plunging the world into a ww3
[00:32:05] <causative_> take some land "back" is the operative word
[00:32:11] <causative_> why the fuck is Russia in Crimea
[00:32:19] <xx> because russians are in crimea
[00:32:21] <AStolypina> Because Crimea is Russian.
[00:32:38] <AStolypina> Perhaps not legally, but in every other meaningful way, it is Russian.
[00:32:58] <xx> put nukes in cuba
[00:33:10] <AStolypina> Well, Russia used to have a military base in Cuba until around 2000, IIRC.
[00:33:30] <xx> not really any point in putting nukes in cuba, given the existence of nuke subs, but it would be fun to see history repeat
[00:34:11] <Tintle> it is not Russian

[00:40:02] <causative_> NATO is not going to nuke anybody, and they certainly would never invade Russia, because it would be completely insane. But if they *wanted* to invade Russia, they do have member states that border it already.
[00:40:29] <causative_> there has never been a nuclear power that invaded the territory of another nuclear power - because leaders of nuclear powers generally aren't totally insane
[00:40:40] <mrig> I think the motivation for that was to understand why it is that normal decent folk turn into animals when requested to do atrocious things by domineering types.
[00:41:31] <causative_> mrig, based on current events, I'd say they don't, but the percentage of "normal decent folk" is quite a bit lower than one might expect
[00:42:17] <causative_> the authoritarian bootlickers have no problem identifying themselves, and fortunately they aren't everyone

[00:42:59] <causative_> no, you can't equate the two behaviors
[00:43:11] <causative_> authoritarianism is not the same as rioting or criminalism
[00:43:22] <causative_> it's a separate personality trait
[00:43:38] <causative_> some authoritarians riot - when told to by the authorities they worship
[00:43:39] <mrig> that why governments use agent provocateurs to start 'events'
[00:43:58] <causative_> but rioting is often the result of other factors, and is often *anti*-authoritarian
[00:44:06] <mrig> because with their resources and modern tec, it is very easy to do.
[00:44:40] <mrig> oh but it serves the authoritarian types.

[00:45:53] <causative_> because tactical small scale nukes are recognized as unacceptable escalation
[00:48:31] <causative_> nukes would be used if a nuclear power was getting invaded and losing, or if a nuclear power was truly crazy and did a first strike (only suspect NK of this), or if a nuclear attack is launched by accident or in response to an accidental false detection of an incoming nuke
[00:49:15] <causative_> other than that, nuclear states are sane enough not to use them
[00:49:17] <causative_> including Russia
[00:49:38] <causative_> and they're sane enough not to invade each other to avoid the first scenario, too

[00:52:36] <mrig> Used depleted uranium all over the middle east.
[00:52:43] <mrig> very recently.
[00:52:49] <Ungwelian> What I'm worried about, is that people in power aren't very rational.
[00:52:50] <causative_> that's not at all comparable
[00:52:54] <mrig> lol
[00:52:59] <mrig> right

[00:54:09] <causative_> they may install someone saner, or push things towards a less dictatorial government
[00:54:11] <Ungwelian> A vast amount of depleted uranium rounds was used. Cleaning them out takes decades.
[00:54:18] <mrig> but it is a great way of making money from radioactive material disposal.

[02:53:19] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: but at the same time imagining it's all the dream of a mind seems unlikely, too basic
[02:53:38] <LunaLinda> If you're a dualist you need to connect matter and mind.

[02:55:19] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: you're your own universe, projecting the bigger universe into yours to experience it
[02:55:23] <LunaLinda> I think consciousness inhabits the universe. Soul inhabits mind.
[02:55:27] <ProfSimm> But you're fundamentally a baby universe
[02:55:43] <LunaLinda> Consciousness projects the entire universe's existence
[02:55:54] <LunaLinda> Like the soul brings into existence the body-mind
[02:56:08] <LunaLinda> By logical consequence of its own ontology.
[02:56:32] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: I think any definition which is not recursive is incomplete. I find it's always the case.
[02:56:41] <ProfSimm> In math, in philosophy, in computing.
[02:56:45] <ProfSimm> In design.
[02:56:57] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: what would be the recursive variant of dualism or non-dualism
[02:57:03] <ProfSimm> What are you relative to the universe
[02:57:29] * LunaLinda gets stuck trying to understand the question
[02:58:00] <ProfSimm> Well, are you just part of the universe? Not quite, you have your own experience and point of view
[02:58:22] <LunaLinda> The universe isn't divisible into discrete parts.
[02:58:27] <ProfSimm> Isn't it
[02:58:38] <LunaLinda> Everything is connected.
[02:58:40] <ProfSimm> Your consciousness is not mine.
[02:58:51] <LunaLinda> It is in a way
[02:59:02] <LunaLinda> I might be you in a dream
[02:59:16] <ProfSimm> Well it's only in a way where this is what non-dualism declares as an axiom, without being able to explain or prove it
[02:59:18] <LunaLinda> Consciousness flows in and out of body-minds
[02:59:25] <ProfSimm> Does it
[02:59:30] <ProfSimm> Again, just an axiom
[02:59:42] <ProfSimm> But aside from guessing how it flows.
[02:59:44] <ProfSimm> Right now.
[02:59:46] <ProfSimm> You are not me.
[02:59:54] <ProfSimm> In terms of consciousness.
[03:00:01] <ProfSimm> I experience myself only.
[03:00:06] <LunaLinda> Ok
[03:00:33] <ProfSimm> You don't experience the universe either. Only your tiny view into it.
[03:00:39] <ProfSimm> So everything is not one.
[03:00:48] <LunaLinda> Oh I see.
[03:01:35] <ProfSimm> It's all relative, but we need to define how come if the Universe is consciousness, your consciousness is separate.
[03:01:40] <LunaLinda> Maybe I am you though, maybe I'm just not seeing through your sense organs
[03:01:49] <ProfSimm> In your dreams do you think your dream friends have their own consciousness?
[03:01:53] <LunaLinda> This is a manifestation of being through my sense organs
[03:01:59] <LunaLinda> Whatever that is
[03:02:26] <LunaLinda> Yeah I see other autonomous beings
[03:02:30] <LunaLinda> In dream
[03:02:33] <LunaLinda> s
[03:02:33] <ProfSimm> You see them, but are they?
[03:02:45] <LunaLinda> Maybe, probably not.
[03:02:50] <LunaLinda> Probably it's all in my brain.
[03:03:03] <ProfSimm> Neural networks can conjure up dream-like images already.
[03:03:11] <LunaLinda> Interesting. I didn't know that.
[03:03:19] <ProfSimm> But it's just arithmetic. At vast scales
[03:04:04] <ProfSimm> Yes, basically most of what we do with NN can be classified as NNs hallucinating it.
[03:04:12] <LunaLinda> What do you conclude about existence by analyzing it in terms of individual separate conscious entities?
[03:04:31] <ProfSimm> Like training a NN to recognize dogs, and then feeding it some photo and looking at how it sees it, it hallucinates dog heads everywhere
[03:04:56] <LunaLinda> Oh shit
[03:05:04] <LunaLinda> That would be a crazy drug to be on
[03:05:12] <ProfSimm> In very much the same way you would. Like we thought some rock on Mars is a face.
[03:05:12] <LunaLinda> I'm glad drugs can't do that to the brain.
[03:06:06] <ProfSimm> Well regarding separate consciousness, it suggests it's not all one consciousness, they're clearly distinct.
[03:06:16] <LunaLinda> Yes
[03:06:21] <ProfSimm> Maybe this entire universe is the mind if a vastly enormous mind
[03:06:54] <ProfSimm> I mean the consciousness of a vastly enormous mind
[03:07:05] <ProfSimm> But despite we're made out of it, we're not it
[03:07:26] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: sort of like this, imagine I give you many tiny balls, and glue, and tell you to make a big ball.
[03:07:53] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: you're making the big ball by gluing little balls together in a ball. But the fact those small balls are balls is irrelevant now.
[03:07:54] <LunaLinda> Then you have greater or lesser amounts of consciousness in this entity or that entity, and the sum of all the consciousnesses is then the totality of existence.
[03:07:56] <ProfSimm> It's just the substrate
[03:08:44] <LunaLinda> How can you have something that's more conscious than something else??
[03:09:01] <LunaLinda> Either it's conscious or it's not, or...?
[03:09:32] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: I'm not comparing things based on whether they're very or little conscious.
[03:09:46] <LunaLinda> Oh I've lost your reasoning somewhere then.
[03:09:57] *** Quits: mrig (~mrig@user/mrig) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[03:10:12] <LunaLinda> Isn't the big ball of consciousness more conscious than one of its component balls?
[03:10:15] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: I'm just stating my consciousness is distinct from yours, and from any other global consciousness that the universe may be
[03:10:29] <LunaLinda> Yeah we already established that
[03:10:44] <LunaLinda> I don't know how to conclude about existence as a whole based on that fundamental assumption
[03:11:00] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: the size of the balls wasn't the point, more it was that you can have a whole made of parts, where the whole is not summing the parts.
[03:11:17] <LunaLinda> I see!
[03:12:21] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: it's very possible the world you experience right now, is just your way of seeing the world.
[03:12:37] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: maybe I don't see colors the same way. Maybe I smell colors, and see smells.
[03:12:55] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: maybe i see humans as a swarm of ants in a colony, and I see colonies of ants as one creature
[03:13:28] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: but I have no way to get this across because everything I say gets translated as if I say it using words and concepts you understand
[03:13:59] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: so I see a red ball and I say "this is a red ball isn't it" and you see a red ball. But despite I said "red ball" I see no red ball, I didn't say red ball either.
[03:14:09] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: it's just what you heard and what you saw.

[03:17:10] <LunaLinda> I see no reason to suspect that would be the case
[03:17:15] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: I don't think we have any facilities to judge how likely it is. Because experience is subjective
[03:17:29] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: how do you judge the likelyhood you see red as I see it.
[03:17:35] <LunaLinda> Part of that subjectivity can be encoded in language.

[03:19:08] <LunaLinda> Which isn't philosophy I know.
[03:19:34] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: no you should use intuition, sure, otherwise we'd be useless

[03:19:49] <ProfSimm> No
[03:19:50] <LunaLinda> Yeah but it has to be rigorous
[03:20:01] <LunaLinda> I'm more of a bullshit artist than a philosopher.
[03:20:03] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: there's a saying "all models are wrong, but some are useful"
[03:20:24] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: models are not just in science, but also in our mind.
[03:20:33] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: your intuition is thousands of models
[03:20:50] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: my models are different though. Maybe drastically.
[03:20:53] <ProfSimm> Maybe not. But maybe yes
[03:21:12] <LunaLinda> The models unexpectedly fail
[03:21:21] <ProfSimm> Well sure.
[03:21:23] <ProfSimm> They're wrong.
[03:21:36] <ProfSimm> But it's a game of statistics.
[03:21:46] <LunaLinda> Oh ok
[03:22:04] <ProfSimm> We hope they're useful most of the time, and also we hope for redundancy, so if we think with thousand models and 100 fail, we lean on the other 900
[03:22:48] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: this concept of "thousands of models" as a structure of intelligence explains why cognitive dissonance is not really a deffect
[03:22:54] <ProfSimm> It's inevitable.
[03:23:09] <ProfSimm> To have no cognitive dissonance means all your models are one model.
[03:23:17] <ProfSimm> You're be basically insane if you did that.

[03:42:50] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: I'd say your description is a particular kind of dissonance.
[03:42:52] <LunaLinda> If I accept reality every time
[03:42:55] <LunaLinda> Then it's not dissonant
[03:43:04] <LunaLinda> Yeah I know that
[03:43:08] <LunaLinda> I gave an example
[03:43:14] <LunaLinda> Of a particular kind of dissonance
[03:43:17] <ProfSimm> But in general, cognitive dissonance means you hold two incompatible thoughts together, believing both.
[03:43:33] <LunaLinda> Reality isn't contradictory
[03:43:47] <LunaLinda> I don't assume I know until I've proven it.
[03:43:50] <ProfSimm> Maybe it isn't. But here's the trick. You have no way to know what reality is
[03:43:58] <LunaLinda> I know
[03:44:07] <LunaLinda> Everything is complete bullshit to me
[03:44:09] <ProfSimm> Well, then all you have is bunch of guesses.
[03:44:22] <ProfSimm> And those guesses may be contradictory, and in fact, inevitably some will be
[03:44:31] <LunaLinda> I see everything through a lens in which very little if any truth is visible.
[03:44:54] <LunaLinda> Yeah I contradicted myself
[03:45:00] <LunaLinda> I try to have it both ways.
[03:45:30] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: the problem is we think truth means an objective fact. But there's no objective judge to tell us "this fact, is objective".
[03:45:42] <ProfSimm> By definition then we don't have access to truth
[03:45:47] <ProfSimm> So truth is something else.
[03:46:09] <ProfSimm> Truth is basically a category you accept as an axiom for yourself.
[03:46:26] <ProfSimm> Hopefully based on sound heuristics, but there are no perfect heuristics
[03:46:50] <ProfSimm> So truth is not a fact. Truth is a decision.
[03:47:01] <ProfSimm> "I decide I take this as is, it becomes a fact in my head"
[03:47:18] <ProfSimm> The fact sits in your head, it doesn't exist outside it
[03:47:38] <LunaLinda> There are very few facts in my head. There's a lot of information of varying degrees of dubiosity.
[03:47:54] <LunaLinda> Mathematical logic is the only thing I can know for sure.
[03:48:15] <LunaLinda> Anything that can be proven mathematically is a fact

[03:50:03] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: but when does the ball stop being a ball is something you have to decide. Without it, math is useless, you can't count.
[03:51:24] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: this is the basis of "lying with statistics". Statistics are math. But how you map math to reality is entirely subjective. So you can lie with statistics, very convincingly too, mathematically sound.
[03:52:38] <ProfSimm> LunaLinda: in my analogy of the "two universes", where your perception is one, the real universe is the other, math only exists in your universe.

[04:23:16] <Irishmanluke> you can conceive of math as this purely abstract thing but as soon as you want to use it you have to map it onto something in reality
[04:24:08] <Irishmanluke> and much of how we even decide what kind of mathematical questions are interesting has to do with how we intuitively conceive of them

[20:28:47] <mrig> out and out rather, not sure where that came from ;)
[20:28:54] <mrig> somewhere in finger memory.
[20:30:17] <pussipupu> Lisp is the easiest language family though

[21:45:55] <mrig> Ego is directly related to memory power in samkya philosophy, ahamkara means the carrier of I.
[21:46:08] <mrig> it is an essential part of the mind model.
[21:46:40] <mrig> thing is to know that it is there, not to remove it, just to see how it alters the perception.
[21:47:02] <mrig> bit like having a useful hard drive, rather than thinking that you are the hard drive.
[21:47:45] <Lumine> I agree
[21:50:17] <mrig> now the thing is that still when mind is cleared, there are distortions and changes that effect mood, difference being that we are able to study those more lucidly if we have a better idea of how it is that we are ourselves distorting that which we perceive.

[21:59:57] <Gerula> learning is a life time dedication, it hit me hard when I realized reading every book out there is impossible
[22:00:13] <mrig> lisp is an admirable goal indeed!

[22:21:11] <Ungwelian> Just checked that I can't access Russia Today.
[22:21:48] <Ungwelian> Meanwhile, no problems with Daily Mail.
[22:22:03] <Lumine> So it's the british behind this...

[22:23:13] <Ungwelian> I wonder when they're going to censor Chinese news outlets.
[22:24:54] <mrig> The war would be over already were it not for western military equipment being given, it is normal that this level of investment also warrants war time acts of propaganda such as blocking media and controlling narratives.
[22:29:01] <Lumine> Both McDonalds and Russia

[22:30:34] <mrig> Bumpy passage of time, that is for sure :|
[22:30:55] <mrig> But not a surprise though.
[22:31:09] *** Quits: todo75 (~todo75@user/todo75) (Quit: todo75)
[22:32:44] <mrig> There are presumably nodes that were previously being used, that are in russia, that are now cut off too.
[22:32:57] <mrig> no idea if irc has been effected?
[22:33:32] <Ungwelian> "Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he dreams himself your master."
[22:35:12] <mrig> oh so very true, information hidden and even worse applied from within the shadows really is the most abominable human practice.

[22:36:35] <mrig> Those who seek to use knowledge as power are abuser of knowledge, fools with knowledge.
[22:37:51] <audrey> Ungwelian: Invest in some serious VPNs
[22:38:20] <audrey> I'm tunneling through Serbia right now and enjoying the censorship free experience.
[22:38:23] <audrey> Imagine! The irony!
[22:38:43] <audrey> EU/US/CA are turning into the people they claim to despise...
[22:40:16] <brigand> i can access rt.com from germany. using a vpn connection over usa
[22:40:31] <audrey> Thinking about going full-privacy-paranoid at some point - setting up own email server, etc.
[22:40:31] <mrig> audrey: that is an interesting route to take, making a note of that.
[22:40:38] <mrig> nice pointer
[22:41:05] <causative_> it is better for people to die resisting an invading tyrant than to submit to the tyrant. War is temporary, tyranny is lasting.
[22:41:08] <mrig> brigand: oh are rt viewable in us?
[22:41:23] <audrey> mrig: Get a VPN service that has nodes in non-aligned states. India, Serbia, and Israel are good locations
[22:41:46] <causative_> even if they lose it is better that they resist, so that the tyrant pays a cost, disincentivizing tyranny
[22:42:05] <mrig> I'm starting to think along those lines, i'm so disgusted by the behaviour right now.
[22:42:07] <brigand> death is permanent though
[22:42:15] <causative_> permanent for a few
[22:42:26] <brigand> ivory tower
[22:42:29] <audrey> LOL you're really hellbent on pumping out the moral platitudes, eh

[22:43:19] <audrey> Lumine: I think Russia will benefit from no longer being exposed to the stupidity and decadence of TikTok and the likes
[22:43:43] <audrey> No McDonalds? Wow! I can hear those kilos being shed from waistlines already... :P
[22:43:53] <Lumine> Oh I was saying whatever to the quote

[22:44:58] <causative_> if a people is not willing to fight for a more just and equitable society, they will live under tyranny forever, and that's worse
[22:45:38] <audrey> Yeah yeah, whatever.
[22:45:38] <Lumine> The biggest hoax in our society is living under the impression that there is a good time coming, somewhere, there in the future.
[22:46:03] <audrey> I think now is a great time to re-examine online privacy habits
[22:46:06] * dTal is having a good time
[22:46:11] <audrey> I'm thinking about trying to get away from Google altogether

[22:46:41] <Lumine> True
[22:46:51] <audrey> Trying to decide whether I should go all the way with a VPS or just do shared hosting on some Israeli server.
[22:47:08] <audrey> (Or other nonaligned location.)
[22:47:09] <Lumine> I would opt for VPS if possible
[22:47:37] <Lumine> Shared hosting is good, provided you know the provider inside out
[22:48:16] * Lumine is using shared hosting right now
[22:48:29] <Ungwelian> I wonder how this virtue signaling could be weaponized to end neocolonialism.
[22:48:47] <Ungwelian> Imagine if western companies left Africa in droves.
[22:48:57] <Ungwelian> Leaving all the infrastructure.
[22:49:13] <mrig> oh when women turn their backs on their own society, it means that the end is already there.
[22:49:36] <audrey> Maybe Russia can go back to cultivating its own culture instead of being saturated with Western stuff.

[23:01:41] <audrey> Reading it now. I think I had scripts disabled.
[23:01:59] <Lumine> audrey: there's also a program called FreeTube, which I sometimes use
[23:02:30] <audrey> Is this something you would recommend me to watch?
