[00:00:24] <kuudes> if you only have hand luggage, surely no one is there to prevent you from staying at an airport
[00:00:38] <kuudes> btw that is one way to cross schengen border to seek asylum
[00:00:57] <capisce> one thing you can't do is skip the first leg and only fly from the second, should your travel plans change somewhat
[00:00:57] <kuudes> which is why officials hold an interactive option to ban any person(s) boarding any flights

[00:01:55] <kuudes> like recently there was a piece of news in finland where a family from moscow was flying to emirates through helsinki, and bought finnair tickets, but was prevented boarding because the national analytics said they would hop off in helsinki
[00:02:31] <gwern> hm. how would they get through immigration/customs? or is the fear they'd claim asylum
[00:02:36] <kuudes> latter
[00:02:55] <kuudes> finnair does not fly to destinations from which there would be asylum applications
[00:03:12] <gwern> heh. at least before putin invaded eh
[00:03:18] <kuudes> this is the key thing re "eu threatens to confiscate your boeing 777 if one migrant comes on it"
[00:03:33] <kuudes> unsure
[00:03:41] <gwern> and it's a pity beause with that 15-years-prison law there's may soon be quite a few people who really do need political asylum
[00:03:43] <kuudes> it is complicated on re putin invasion
[00:03:57] <kuudes> I would recommend applying asylum elsewhere, ukrainians could apply in finland though
[00:04:49] <kuudes> they have recently run it through the parliament that they can actually just close the whole border and not hear any pleas etc
[00:05:29] <kuudes> so far trains still run cross border though

[04:50:03] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: I dunno if you or EAI need *more* image data, even if Bamboo claims theirs is super-clean, but the models might be usefully independent and provide additional embeddings or supervision
[04:50:21] <RiversHaveWings> oh hm
[04:51:26] <RiversHaveWings> it's classes? like a giant imagenet? not text captions?
[04:51:53] <gwern> hierarchical classes + bounding boxes
[04:52:01] <RiversHaveWings> ah
[04:52:23] <RiversHaveWings> text captions are the most useful form of supervision for what i do

[04:52:47] <Robomot> > It's almost like some tiny extremist faction has gained control of Windows Thi... | Hacker News
[04:53:28] <gwern> yes, but you can obviously turn them into text captions: "an image of X". when you have categories like "willow flute", I wonder how much in-the-wild text captions really buy you
[04:53:59] <RiversHaveWings> a lot, i think, tbh
[04:54:30] <RiversHaveWings> since in-the-wild text captions can like, they're more compositional
[04:54:40] <gwern> 'Either way user feedback was so strong that that got reverted in the very next update' <-- good to know complaining can work
[04:55:28] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: another point: the contrastive learning will be a lot more efficient when you *know* the categories. so you can treat all the entries in the batch in the same category as positives for each other, not just themselves
[04:55:39] <saturn2> you'll never be able to complain loud enough about enough things at once
[04:55:46] <RiversHaveWings> ahh
[04:56:08] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: hypothetically, you can even use the hierarchical nature of the categories to define an a priori distance between every single pair of images...
[04:56:42] <gwern> wonder how efficient *that* would be for contrastive learning? and then of course you can train on your caption images

[04:58:20] * gwern wonders what a model which just directly predict the distance for a pair of images would learn
[04:59:39] <gwern> train it as a two-headed siamese model, then when it converges, train it as a single-headed model contrastively on your caption/image data
[05:00:00] <gwern> man I bet that would be *really* cheap to train
[05:04:49] <gwern> 'As shown in Table 2, ResNet-50 (RN50) pre-trained on CLIP (400M) or IG-1B (1B) achieves better downstream task performance than BiT pre-trained on ImageNet1K (IN1K) [60]. However, compared to RN50 pre-trained on Bamboo, CLIPRN50 or RN50 pre-trained on IG-1B achieves inferior performance. It indicates that the amount of informative-dense annotations instead of the sheer number of annotations...
[05:04:55] <gwern> ...is much more essential for model pre-training'

[18:16:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: You get what you pay for I guess
[18:16:51] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: there's lots of stuff which is not "a" sequence, like sets. you can always encode them as a sequence, though. so the question is really, is there anything which can't be encoded as a bit string to arbitrary accuracy? to which the answer seems to be no
[18:17:26] <gwern> like equivariance in alphafold. do you need it? no. you can just make alphafold bigger and spend more compute/data training it. it's a constant-factor
[18:17:40] <feep[work]> "you can always encode them as a sequence" iff axiom of choice!
[18:17:47] * feep[work] has not read up.
[18:18:00] <gwern> is not constructive so you can say that such an object exists but you will never actually compute anything on it
[18:18:14] <gwern> (the mathematicians will orgasm over the equivariance and write thousands of papers, but ultimately, does DL need it? no.)
[18:18:38] <feep[work]> well true, there is a largest number after all
[18:18:49] <feep[work]> (or at least, a largest useful number)
[18:20:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is the largest number
[18:20:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> GIVE IT TO ME SO I CAN ADD 1 TO IT
[18:20:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> >:|
[18:20:46] <feep[work]> that doesn't seem very useful~
[18:20:58] <gwern> the largest number is 'BusyBeaver(n_atoms_in_observable_universe)', one assumes
[18:22:19] <feep[work]> I personally think it's 2^64.
[18:22:24] <feep[work]> -1.
[18:22:58] <feep[work]> (this of course means that ipv6 is sin&decadence.)
[18:23:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean I agree with that
[18:23:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> ipv4 should be enough for anybody
[18:23:43] <feep[work]> right, and since ipv4 is enough for anybody, ipv4 * ~7 billion should be enough for everybody
[18:23:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But more people have computers than that!" TAKE THE COMPUTERS AWAY FROM THEM
[18:23:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> They don't deserve computers.
[18:24:21] <feep[work]> which fits very comfortably in ipv64bit
[18:25:19] <feep[work]> er, hang on no, well it's CLOSE ENOUGH anyways
[18:25:43] <feep[work]> of course, then ipv6 follows the philosophy of "and so we doubled it again!"
[18:25:57] <feep[work]> which is       like, okay, they *really* didn't want to have to change it again, I guess
[18:27:20] <gwern> plus a almost arbitrarily large memory space lets you do things like pick a random IP address and use it without needing to check if it already exists. like I recall one case of a 128-bit memory system where you just write to random new points because the probability of a collision is so vanishingly low
[18:27:33] <feep[work]> this kills the cache
[18:27:53] <feep[work]> amusing party trick tho
[18:27:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unlikely things always happen
[18:27:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact
[18:28:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're guaranteed to happen at the most inconvenient possible time
[18:28:49] <feep[work]> to be fair, I think by the point you start talking about collision probability over the estimated lifetime of the universe assuming every human does the computation once a second, we may entertain the notion that the unlikely thing could not happen.
[18:28:57] <two2thehead> TIL that Blackberry (aka RIM) is still around
[18:29:03] <gwern> I think the argument is that even if you have like a petabyte of RAM in active use, the probability of a random collision between any of it is still lower than things like cosmic rays simultaneously hitting the same word and changing the fetched memory address or something
[18:29:27] <feep[work]> uuid uses this approach too, I believe
[18:29:36] <PapuaHardyNet> yep
[18:30:31] <two2thehead> 'A Universal Unique Identifier, or UUID, is a 128-bit value used to uniquely identify almost anything imaginable on the internet -- from databases, to system instances, to anything else. A UUID is almost guaranteed to be unique from any other UUID now and until forever -- well, until at least the year 3400. Most UUIDs used today are Variant 1 UUIDs.'
[18:30:35] <two2thehead> Ah, I remember this
[18:30:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am opposed to UUIDs also.
[18:31:36] <two2thehead> I was bored while watching _Person of Interest_ got to wondering how large/complex an index number/primarykey had to be to assign one to every human being alive

[18:41:19] <gwern> kuudes: yes, I wanted to look at the original because I can't tell what of that is speculation, commentary, original, or what
[18:42:10] <kuudes> that should be the copypaste of the article
[18:42:29] <gwern> unless the times has drastically changed its writing style and intersperses random author names and profanity, it's not
[18:42:50] <kuudes> hmm
[18:43:01] <gwern> and the times is usually not in the habit of saying things like "this part is not confirmed by the times"
[18:43:20] <gwern> so, it's some sort of mish-mash and I have no idea what
[18:43:39] <gwern> but I can't get into the times article and I have exhausted my caring budget

[18:45:52] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : There's an unmet compsci need for archive.is-esque mirroring services *but* for it to be logged in/agent-specific. An example would be, if I logged into my email, and clicked on 'save this page', the archive-site would have a snapshot of the my email homepage, but no more. I imagine this would fix the 'log in to read article' problem gwern has
[18:46:49] <kuudes> what
[18:46:53] <two2thehead> You could save a jpeg of the whole page, but that's not very fun
[18:47:33] <PapuaHardyNet> you can also print as PDF
[18:47:58] <two2thehead> kuudes, forcing people to log in to read an article prevents archiving/mirroring sites from duplicating it. If a feature exists where you could upload what you see on your browser to a mirroring site, that would help immensely
[18:48:03] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, huh. that could work
[18:48:44] <gwern> archive.ph/md *does* have the article, it's just being a jerk about captchas and blocking users
[18:49:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not being blocked, just a heads up if you want a PDF version of the article

Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bülow's

[21:52:07] <gwern> you don't make tourette's go away overnight, tho
[21:52:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have no idea what causes it (there's the usual pile of "it's correlated with X or Y or Z, at p=whatever" studies, with the usual replication problems, and of course the set X/Y/Z spans a ridiculous range of things)
[21:52:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Similarly we don't know what mediates it neurologically (ditto)
[21:53:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> And even the diagnosis - "Tics that may appear to mimic those of Tourette's—but are associated with disorders other than Tourette's—are known as tourettism[87] and are ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome.[81] ... If another condition might better explain the tics, tests may be done; for example, if there is diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity, an EEG may be ordered." ... "better

[21:54:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's literally a "diagnosis of the gaps" - Tourette's is *defined as* "these-and-such behavioral symptoms, UNLESS we know what causes them"

[22:04:55] <adiabatic> for them

[22:15:40] <bildramer> it's not even always wrong, it's just wrong in the instances where it fails to distinguish the thing it's pointing at and "person consciously decides to fake disorders for clout", which is all of tiktok obviously
[22:18:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There is nothing physically wrong with them, even though they seem sincere in their belief that they have this tic disorder." ... but isn't that also true of "actual" Tourette's

[22:21:37] <pompolic> too high a simulacrum level for that i imagine

[22:34:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is, on both "sides" of this debate, a real reluctance to grapple with the degree to which all of this is socially constructed
[22:35:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And the fact that *I* am saying that should tell you something)
[22:40:01] <ggreer> I'm also pretty sure that trans identification is a brand new phenomenon. if you look back at history, there's almost nobody claiming to have gender dysphoria. in contrast there are plenty of people claiming to be gay. we also see homosexual behavior in animals
[22:40:18] <ggreer> that said, I don't care if gender dysphoria is a "natural" phenomenon or not. if someone wants to get cosmetic surgery and hormones to make themselves look how they want to look, let them

[22:41:59] <pompolic> i think this gets to the heart of it
[22:41:59] <ggreer> vrs: oh there's plenty of evidence of cross-dressing and similar behaviors. I'm talking about dysphoria: people feeling tortured (and possibly driven to suicide) over the fact that they're in a man/woman's body
[22:42:46] <vrs> oh that's just how you get access to pills in our current day and society
[22:43:16] <pompolic> yeah i'm wondering to what extent it's a strat to get access to the restricted stuff
[22:43:38] <vrs> sometimes you have to be the utility monster
[22:43:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, I think that cuts through a lot of the "questions"
[22:43:52] <pompolic> thanks for clarifying for me
[22:44:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Theodore Dalrymple talks about stuff like this, iirc, as does TLP, of course
[22:44:21] <pompolic> i was going to say "not because of being junkies but from actually wanting this and getting blocked by bioethicist fucks"
[22:44:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not in the gender dysphoria context, but it's the same thing, really)
[22:44:45] <ggreer> there are a lot of trans communities online and I don't see many saying "claim you're dysphoric to get drugs". I do see a lot of people claiming they're dysphoric and hating their bodies and whatnot
[22:46:19] <pompolic> i mean something like
[22:46:24] <pompolic> surgery is expensive
[22:46:31] <pompolic> hormones are controlled substances probably
[22:46:44] <vrs> it's one of the things you don't say out loud
[22:47:06] <pompolic> if i became trans would i be allowed to
[22:47:28] <vrs> but often it's "eh I don't actually feel that bad for this body, I just want to be a woman more than I want to be a man"
[22:47:45] <pompolic> oh, misunderstood the referent of "it"
[22:47:53] <pompolic> i think this is ZMD's whole schtick
[22:48:23] <vrs> saying that you're dysphoric or memeing yourself into it is quite instrumentally useful so people do it
[22:48:43] <pompolic> i believe this happens
[22:49:01] <pompolic> i'm trying to figure out how to say why i believe it without turning it into a pity party
[22:49:33] <pompolic> i guess the tl;dr once upon a time i was i think fairly emotionally neglected and i generated the thought, "maybe if i became a [utility monster] people would not neglect me"
[22:49:42] <adiabatic> "ZMD"?

[22:50:08] <vrs> (speaking from personal experience and from knowing many transppl quite well, and I wish them all the best in their transition but I think dysphoria should not be a necessary checkbox)
[22:50:19] <pompolic> right
[22:51:10] <vrs> if you could just get the hormones otc, I believe the base rate of dysphoria among those who transition would be something like 0.5, severe dysphoria maybe 1/6
[22:51:45] <pompolic> story, part 2: i took a few steps towards this and it blew up on my face because people just got meaner, because i probably didn't fit the sympathetic victim criteria

[22:53:01] <pompolic> so i think i kind of went back on it
[22:53:29] <pompolic> it doesn't help that i actually experience dysphoria for unrelated reasons over a few things
[22:54:05] <pompolic> in recent years I've become more skeptical of people's ability to self-modify
[22:54:14] <pompolic> but maybe utility monster modification does work
[22:54:49] <adiabatic> only if you pick a modification that makes people want to feed you and not think you're an asshole
[22:54:55] <ggreer> "black lives matterhorn" XD
[22:55:35] <pompolic> adiabatic: "does work" in the sense that it's possible to perform on one's self
[22:55:54] <pompolic> something like selectively sensitizing one's self to relevant stimuli
[22:55:56] <adiabatic> as opposed to one you need to go see a surgeon or whatever for?
[22:56:08] <pompolic> as opposed to hard biodeterminism
[22:56:08] <ggreer> vrs: is there a country that doesn't restrict hormones as much? if so, do people there claim dysphoria less often?
[22:56:10] <pompolic> or something
[22:57:00] <pompolic> ie the pattern of what makes you suffer intensely being biologicaly determined and any change in it being some sort of meditation/self-deception

[23:26:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Fried up some blini (and from them, cheese blintzes) in my homemade clarified butter today. Great success!
[23:28:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Used my new nonstick pan that came in today (replacing the previous one, same model, not even 3 years old but all scratched up and non-shiny). Already scratched it. Those nonstick coatings are *ludicrously* fragile

[23:29:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now looking for a nylon spatula and *obviously* all of them have Amazon reviews like "uh this melted and pieces of molten plastic crumbled into my scrambled eggs, negative twelve stars >:( "
[23:29:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> If only I could find the spatula I had for years before the handle broke! But - again, *obviously* - they discontinued it forever ago

[23:35:31] <Robomot> Himbo sapiens (@yashkaf): "Last Thursday Gamestop was expected to report a big profit from the holiday sales period. Instead they reported their biggest loss ever. $GME is 𝘂𝗽 10% since then. This company doesn't exist to sell video games anymore, only to mock people who believe markets should make sense."

[23:36:40] <ggreer> we don't see the old crappy consumer products because that stuff got thrown away real fast. go look at an old mail order catalog to see what crappy products the past had

[23:51:06] <gwern> oh shit the manasuka woodblock seller has multiple levels. the $50 level apparently does *not* include copyright -_-
[23:53:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yeah, that's a practice that I despise, personally
[23:53:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I commission an art, I damn well better be getting the copyright to it
[23:54:04] <gwern> hm, well, I do not care about the copyright, only about it being FLOSS. however, I think from an artist's perspective, it's the same thing and the distinction is of no interest
[23:54:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just so
[23:55:12] <gwern> (the 'premium' is '2-3 figures' and 'commercial use', and is $250, where I was thinking of spending $200. that's not *too* different... but I thought I'd be generously overpaying while now I'm more grudgingly paying if I go for that)
[23:55:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And of course if you get the copyright you can always license it CC or w/e, so yes, no difference)
[23:56:28] <gwern> (yeah, it'd only make a differene if they cared about FLOSS/Free culture and would be willing to knock some off the price since I am paying them to release it, not squatting on the copyright myself. I uh think very few artists these days care about stuff like creative commons)
[23:58:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course not, they're desperate for any scraps of profit, not creating art for art's sake
[23:58:58] <gwern> I think it's also just the culture has moved on. when was the last time you ever saw anything being linked excitedly for being 'Creative Commons-licensed'? you used to be able to get slashdot level traffic simply for 'a creative commons licensed comic book!'
[23:59:17] <gwern> these days, the kids just take remix and the irrelevance of copyright for utterly granted
[23:59:35] <gwern> caring about the *license* is just an insanely fuddyduddy Boomer thing to do
[23:59:53] <gwern> they will care exactly insofar as the Youtube monetization algorithm forces them to care
