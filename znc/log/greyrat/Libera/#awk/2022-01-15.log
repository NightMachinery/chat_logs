[23:18:07] <nmz> aha?
[23:18:30] <tercaL> I'd like to get only the output of the "id" value (which is 894669b...), and in order to do this (I only know the "IP" but "ID" is random) I add; | grep -B1 "1.2.1.14" | awk '{print $2}' | head -n 1 | sed 's/"//' | sed 's/",//'
[23:18:52] <tercaL> and such set of commands gives me the result I want, which is only: 894669bc1f004938887b646015ffa610 - now I'd like to ask is there any *clearer* and safer way to do this? Issuing sed two times seems noob to me, myself.
