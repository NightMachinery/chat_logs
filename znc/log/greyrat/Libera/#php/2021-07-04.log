[00:45:04] <paule32> hello
[00:45:17] <paule32> i have a little problem with doxygen:  https://dpaste.com/4S79F79YS
[00:45:27] <paule32> command "." not found
[00:54:07] <Blondie101010> you give an error about the command you ran, without even giving it to us
[00:54:39] <Blondie101010> but no this is NOT a php question...  it simply means that you need to learn to use your computer and tools
[00:54:40] <paule32> doxygen devdoc.cfg
[00:55:25] <Blondie101010> I'm sure I could figure it out in less than 2 minutes, but it's not PHP related at all
[00:55:41] <Blondie101010> check what you actually called
[00:55:52] <Blondie101010> simple and basic troubleshooting
[00:58:01] <Blondie101010> one hint: type doxygen
[00:58:05] <paule32> ok i found it: INPUT_FILTER = at line 174
[00:58:20] <paule32> this does the doxygen compiler dont like
[00:58:46] <paule32> idk why
[00:59:18] <Blondie101010> that doesn't make sense
[00:59:29] <Blondie101010> what does `type doxygen` give you?
[00:59:43] <__adrian> paule32: this isn't a php question. i'd agree it's likely a typo when you typed the command (e.g., `. /doxygen` instead of `./doxygen`) rather than even a problem with doxygen specifically.
[01:00:36] <Blondie101010> I think it's a shell / script problem
[01:04:03] <paule32> i solve it

[02:59:40] <carlino3> hi
[03:12:35] <carlino3> can anyone recommend a good logging service? to receive live notifications, for example by e-mail
[03:13:44] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32)
[03:14:01] <Blondie101010> a logging service logs
[03:14:25] <Blondie101010> the closer I can think of is that you wish to monitor your logs for certain events and get them to alert
[03:15:36] <carlino3> i log to log files but i also want to receive the logs instantly to somewhere outside the server
[03:15:46] <carlino3> i was doing this by e-mail but it is not a good idea
[03:16:08] <Blondie101010> why do you need to replicate it online?
[03:16:30] <carlino3> so i can monitor what happens in the system without logging in to the server
[03:16:49] <Blondie101010> ok so make it log to your home computer
[03:17:07] <__adrian> !+recommend due diligence
[03:17:08] <php-bot> we recommend you research many, try a few, pick one; rinse and repeat as necessary. see also /msg php-bot recommend
[03:17:18] <__adrian> they're easy to find
[03:17:50] <Blondie101010> seems like a good way to create problems to save 5 minutes

[03:18:58] <carlino3> @__adrian yes that's what i want to do but i don't have anything in mind
[03:20:03] <Blondie101010> ask your sysadmin
[03:20:11] <carlino3> i'm my sysadmin lol
[03:20:17] <Blondie101010> if you want to do something in PHP and get stuck, show us the code having the problem
[03:20:23] <Blondie101010> I know, don't dig your grave!
[03:20:25] <__adrian> rollbar, sentry, airbrake
[03:20:46] <carlino3> @__adrian yes! i'll take a look on these, thanks
[03:24:48] <__adrian> pain:useful ratio can be enough to be worth it when you have a big team
[03:25:01] <__adrian> but in many cases, monolog sending to email is plenty
[03:26:34] <carlino3> the problem with e-mail is that the system sometimes it is too log-intensive
[03:26:46] <carlino3> and i get blocked temporarily by the email provider
[03:26:55] <Blondie101010> hence why I started on filtering for alerts from the beginning!!!

[03:27:46] <__adrian> in any case, you have someplace to start from
[03:28:48] <Blondie101010> being able to consult logs before connecting to the machine seems like a bad justification to a bad / useless setup

[04:08:40] <__adrian> it's always good to at least mind the answers people give, even if you don't ultimately follow them - otherwise, why are you asking at all?
[04:09:54] <__adrian> the tl;dr: of composition over inheritance is:
[04:09:55] <__adrian> class No extends Foo extends Bar {  }

[14:32:38] <paule32> thank you
[14:32:50] <paule32> i have proofed a little bit:  https://dpaste.com/7TSR8GL9S
[14:37:11] <genom> a bit weird regexp as for me
[14:38:26] <genom> btw isn't here a misprint?
[14:38:28] <genom> $replace = 'array \$default [ "r" =&#62;, "g" =&#62;, "g" =&#62; ]';
[14:38:41] <genom> two 'g' s instead g and b
[14:39:12] <paule32> oh
[14:39:15] <paule32> typo
[14:39:30] <paule32> thx for notice
[14:39:55] <paule32> last g should be a b
[14:55:56] <stenno> for some reason php.net recommends using ${foo} notation for regexp replace interpolation

[15:00:35] <stenno> which is _super_ confusing
[15:00:43] <stenno> why does it even work like that
[15:00:51] <stenno> thats a design flaw imo

[22:49:28] *** zerobeholder is now known as ZeroBeholder
[22:49:29] <Tylae> I'm poking about the web-php code, I remember vaguely being done with the mirroring program. Am I safe to ignore code related to mirrors? I'm considering refactoring it out... or may add it to a "to do" list because it seems like web-php needs improvements elsewhere
[22:51:11] *** ZeroBeholder is now known as zerobeholder
[22:51:14] <AllenJB> Tylae: You may want to try asking in the PHP room on chat.stackoverflow.com web chat (requires some SO points to talk) - some knowledgeable people hang out there
[22:51:34] <AllenJB> Not a core dev myself, but I follow internals and as far as I know there is no mirror system any more.

[23:29:45] <Tylae> I'm trying to get a better understanding of how redirects work in web-php. I get different results when I attempt a redirect on php.net compared to when I try on localhost with built-in PHP web server. It's a bit confusing because I would expect the redirects to work the same in localhost as they would on php.net. I want to finish out https://github.com/php/doc-en/pull/255.

[23:46:18] <Blondie101010> Tylae:  what is different in your redirect?
[23:47:06] <Blondie101010> is it the 301 from php.net that you're just not doing so not getting the same thing for sure
