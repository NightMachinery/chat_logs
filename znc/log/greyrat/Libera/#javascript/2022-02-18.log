[08:58:01] <Maxdamantus> The model was designed something like 30 years ago. I'm not sure it's inherently a great thing about HTTP.
[08:58:24] <Maxdamantus> It's just something that happened to be part of the original design and has been gradually extended to include more cases.

[08:58:48] <ljharb> and the verb + status code are very great things about http
[08:59:18] <Maxdamantus> Your application is very likely not the only thing in the pipeline that could generate HTTP status codes, but it should be practically the only thing that could generate 200 status codes.
[08:59:36] <ljharb> i don't even know what that means
[08:59:52] <ljharb> every single thing that responds on http should make maximal use of the range of http verbs and status codes.
[09:00:24] <ljharb> it's a standard way to programmatically convey intent that doesn't require foreknowledge of some schema
[09:01:03] <Maxdamantus> So if a client receives a 504, how do they know that it was an intentional code raised by the application, rather than just the frontend proxy failing to forward the request?
[09:01:49] <ljharb> such a proxy IS the application
[09:02:19] <Maxdamantus> No. The application exists separately from the frontend proxy, and it might do application-level requests to other services which might time out.
[09:02:32] <Maxdamantus> If it just spits out a 504 whenever anything times out, the 504 status code becomes meaningless.
[09:02:45] <ljharb> not from the client's perspective.
[09:02:58] <ljharb> there's just the server, and the client should NEVER be able to know anything more granular than that
[09:03:03] <ljharb> (also it's 503)
[09:03:18] <ljharb> that's the more common one, at least
[09:03:28] <conr> theskillwithin: so i currently do that for the cancel buttons in the modal
[09:03:39] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: if it times out and it's sending the code for timeout, that's the meaning
[09:03:47] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: what would be meaningless is doing *literally anything else* when it times out
[09:04:00] <ljharb> codebam: you can't and shouldn't be trying
[09:04:02] <conr> do you think i just need conditionals to check if it's outside the modal && clicks the cancel button?
[09:04:09] <ljharb> codebam: if you want to know the caller, have the caller tell you with an argument
[09:04:41] <Maxdamantus> ljharb: if I want to show inside my application that something timed out (eg, build took too long), that should be explicitly written as part of a 200 response.
[09:04:50] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: and, if the application is making other http requests that might time out, and its most intelligent handling of that is to pretend it timed out too, then that shitty architecture *should* be represented by too many timeouts
[09:04:53] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: wrong
[09:04:56] <codebam> okay
[09:05:01] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: a 200 response is *invalid* if something went wrong
[09:05:07] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: the http spec mandates these semantics.
[09:05:11] <Maxdamantus> eg, consider something like CI software. If the build fails, you'll get 200 responses telling you how it failed.
[09:05:17] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: not in good CI software
[09:05:27] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: properly working CI will only report 200 when it fails.
[09:05:35] <ljharb> when it succeeds, sorry
[09:05:44] <ljharb> if you're using tools that report 200 for non-success, then you are using the worst possible tools.
[09:05:44] <Maxdamantus> But the CI software succeeded.
[09:05:48] <Maxdamantus> Something else failed.

[09:11:38] <ljharb> not necessarily.

[09:17:32] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: don't get me wrong, it's important to know why it failed, but HTTP status isn't going to answer that question
[09:17:44] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: you can have the proper http code and still put disambiguating info in the body

[09:22:49] *** Joins: mexen (uid495612@user/mexen)
[09:25:08] <Maxdamantus> I'd say it makes the handling code a lot more complicated.
[09:25:31] <ljharb> it's no different at all
[09:25:43] <ljharb> even if you branch on the code, it's just about which branch this logic is in
[09:25:57] <ljharb> either way you have two sets of conceptual status codes to cover
[09:26:13] <ljharb> or, you could do what every actual CI system does, and conflate the two, because in practice *it never matters*
[09:26:36] <Maxdamantus> The handling code should basically expect a 200 response in which case it shows the build output to the user (which might contain an error or a success message—just whatever text would show up on a terminal). If it gets some other response, it can tell the user that something went wrong, or maybe reload the page, or retry the request.

[09:40:40] <Maxdamantus> eh, was going to give an alternative which is temporarily adding a "click" handler to `document`, but that's more fragile and makes more assumptions.

[10:41:25] <ljharb> i'm not excluding anyone
[10:41:45] <ljharb> i'm just acknowledging the facts that prices reflect how much people want to live somewhere
[10:41:56] <rustyshackleford> but also, if you can do the same job remote as you can in the office
[10:42:12] <rustyshackleford> why does where you live affect compensation?
[10:42:48] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: it depends on whether you think market rates are based on "cost of living plus value of work" or not
[10:42:59] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: since they're always based on cost of living, if your cost of living is lower, you make less

[10:43:18] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: right. but it's not just value. it's both.
[10:43:39] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: why should you have more takehome just because you don't have roots in an expensive place?
[10:44:00] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: a company with that kind of policy would find themselves unable to hire in all the expensive places. which is where all the talent is clustered.
[10:44:16] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: so they'd have to pay a premium for those places to hire from there. and lo, we're back where we started.
[10:44:22] <rustyshackleford> what do you think of using offshore teams?
[10:44:36] <ljharb> in theory, the country someone lives in doesn't matter
[10:44:52] <ljharb> in practice, the kind of work you get from outsourced teams is more mechanized and requires inordinate amounts of project management

[15:27:42] <sickdyd> then instead of function(settings, data,textStatus, jqXHR) you can do function(data) and access data.settings and data.arguments.whatever
[15:28:45] <nemesit> don't like that ;-p
[15:28:53] <sickdyd> actually, why doing this in the first place? function(...arguments) you could just do function(arguments)
[15:29:22] <sickdyd> to me it makes more sense than an array

[15:29:51] <nemesit> ideally as a drop in replacement so I don't gotta change much xD
[15:29:56] <sickdyd> not sure about your limitations, but you could use fetch instead of jQuery

[15:56:24] <stenno> but yeah its a non-problem
[15:56:49] <sickdyd> this is pretty nice in case you didn't see it before: https://polyfill.io/v3/url-builder/
[15:57:12] <sickdyd> but it's free, therefore it could go down
[15:57:54] <stenno> do you know of a polyfill thats not free? lol
[15:58:19] <teresko> ^ that
[15:58:27] <sickdyd> I mean, this requires their server to be up to return you the polyfill you need
[15:58:43] <sickdyd> if it goes down you won't get what you need
[15:58:59] <stenno> you can just, you know, download the polyfill
[15:59:00] <sickdyd> it's pretty neat though, if your browser doesn't need the polyfill, you will not get any additional js
[15:59:04] <stenno> and then you have it
[15:59:20] <sickdyd> yeah, the purpose of the link above is to avoid having that extra js for browsers that don't need it
[15:59:30] <teresko> sickdyd: that sounds like insanity, but with additional steps

[15:59:44] <stenno> keep in mind that polyfilling is done dynamically
[15:59:52] <stenno> either you polyfill for everyone or for no-one
[16:00:02] <sickdyd> not with the above polyiflls I linked
[16:00:16] <sickdyd> that's the neat thing, and that's why you need their server to be up
[16:00:19] <stenno> having any polyfill done after feature detection will put you into dire problems
[16:00:25] <stenno> i don't think its neat at all
[16:00:27] <stenno> it sounds terrible
[16:00:37] <sickdyd> tell them to take the website down :>
[16:00:49] <stenno> no, i am telling YOU to not use them in production
[16:01:00] <sickdyd> haha
[16:01:11] <sickdyd> never used it
[16:01:26] <teresko> well, if someone does, I see it as a major security risk
[16:01:28] <stenno> imagine a customer calling and then having to figure out which of the features were polyfilled
[16:01:51] <sickdyd> I didn't need you to tell me to not use them, it's just something might people could use for a personal project
[16:02:17] <teresko> I really don't want my website to start probing 192.168.0.1 from the browser of every user we have
[16:02:33] <teresko> because this is how you get XSS

[21:06:49] <jr_web_dev> thats what im trying to figure out KevinX. silly gave me the code without line 22 .. he gave me with line 23, which is commented out.. not sure if i got confused in the chatroom and applied the wrong logic..maybe they were not even talking to me
[21:07:16] <KevinX> what do YOU want it to be though? Like img-person-.jpg?
[21:07:24] <jr_web_dev> but line 23 img${banner.data.set.id} was just giving me the issue
[21:08:23] <KevinX> ok i understand now
[21:08:36] <KevinX> You're mapping multiple times. You want to combine them
[21:09:52] <KevinX> I would put the forEach on banners, then put all the rest inside there

[23:10:35] <banana_> "they could sell a bucket of lard, and call it healthy" ... wow
[23:10:52] <ljharb> banana_: your freedom to eat something doesn't depend on how it's marketed to you
[23:10:52] <buu> joakimk: well, for starters, .then() takes a function (reference)
[23:11:01] <joakimk> ok yeah
[23:11:04] <ljharb> banana_: someone's freedom to *market it to you* can be curtailed any way the government wants

[23:14:29] <KevinX> @ljharb and thats an educated choice. I do the same. Thats why i'm saying we should UNban stuff

[23:33:34] <ljharb> buu: nobody has freedoms on the derivative work i haven't released yet
[23:33:37] <buu> blueagain: Because they've lost freedoms
[23:33:42] <ljharb> buu: i can't remove their freedoms on the original work, and that's all that matters
[23:33:45] <ljharb> buu: freedoms aren't transitive
[23:33:46] <buu> blueagain: Which is the whole point of the gpl
[23:34:00] <ljharb> buu: your rights over an object are *lost* when you give it to me. you don't retain them.
[23:34:05] <buu> blueagain: GPL philosophy is about ensuring that everyone in the chain has the same freedoms
[23:34:09] <ljharb> right
[23:34:14] <ljharb> but that's not how things actually work
[23:34:18] <ljharb> nor does that actually increase freedom
[23:34:24] <blueagain> I can't really follow. The person who added proprietary code atop the FOSS code wants to monetize. That's fair as far as I'm concerned.
[23:34:29] <buu> blueagain: MIT license has been adopted by people who think they should be allowed to do whatever they want with code they downloaded regardless of who it hurts
[23:34:29] <ljharb> because in practice, that discourages people from using GPL software in the first place
[23:34:35] <blueagain> That doesn't impact anyone else who wants to use the original code.
[23:34:45] <blueagain> No one is used.
[23:35:14] <blueagain> buu: Who is it hurting though?
[23:35:15] *** Joins: Betal (~Betal@user/betal)
[23:35:22] <buu> ljharb: The counter argument is that the more free gpl code is being undercut by the cheaper/less free mit code
[23:35:29] <buu> blueagain: The *end user*
[23:35:48] <buu> blueagain: Again, the original example, RMS was hurt because he had a printer that *didn't work* because the software was unfixable
[23:35:48] <blueagain> Why? He still has free choice. He can use the original software just as anyone else can.
[23:35:55] <ljharb> buu: without the mit code, it'd just be ignored, and everything would still be proprietary
[23:35:55] <qswz> I wish I could define a svh from a css file
[23:35:59] <buu> blueagain: No he can't, it won't run on the printer
[23:36:03] <qswz> svg*
[23:36:07] <ljharb> buu: GPL was a great bridge from "all proprietary" to "open source". but its time is past.
[23:36:09] <ljharb> *passed
[23:36:12] <buu> ljharb: You can't prove that at all
[23:36:25] <ljharb> buu: nor can you prove that things being MIT hurts anybody
[23:36:41] <buu> Sure I can
[23:36:44] <blueagain> buu: couldn't RMS take the original FOSS software that the printer software was based on and extend it himself, or are you talking generally about proprietary software to begin with?
[23:36:45] <ljharb> buu: my software is very widely used, and nobody has ever provided me with an example of it being bundled into proprietary tech
[23:36:50] <ljharb> buu: i'd be happy to hear my first one
[23:37:12] <buu> blueagain: Well, it's a combination of things, in the very original case, obviously the code was completely propietary so he couldn't do that, right?
[23:37:24] <blueagain> buu: he didn't have to buy the printer, did he?
[23:37:28] <blueagain> That's freedom.
[23:37:33] <buu> blueagain: But in the tivo case, the original foss software was extended in such a way that you couldn't use the original code on the tivo any more
[23:37:44] <buu> blueagain: There is no ethical consumption under capitalism

[23:38:15] <blueagain> buu: I'm not very familiar with tivo, but obviously if you can't use the original FOSS version, that could be an issue.
[23:38:25] <blueagain> buu: I can't parse that last sentence, could you rephrase?
[23:38:58] <buu> blueagain: short story is that gpl3 added clauses to prevent so called "Tivoization" whose famous example is that tivo took gpl code then added extra code to prevent anything but their specific version of the code from running on the tivo
[23:39:25] <buu> blueagain: So you had access to the gpl code but you couldn't modify it and run it on the tivo because they blocked you
[23:39:42] <blueagain> buu: that's fair enough. So they basically broke gpl's terms?
[23:39:54] <buu> blueagain: Thus leading to the philosophical argument that the *user*, the person who *bought* the tivo, should not be restricted by from running their own modified code on their own device they bought
[23:40:03] <buu> blueagain: Well, it was legal under gpl2, so they made a gpl3
[23:40:42] <ljharb> why should the license govern that tho
[23:40:47] <blueagain> I'm of the opinion that when you buy something, it's on you to know what you're getting and what you can do with that.
[23:40:49] <ljharb> that's a separate "right to modify" concern
[23:40:56] <buu> blueagain: the more relevant modern cases are where I'm, say, aws, and I take postgresql and add a feature to it, then I add it to my service offering and sell hosted versions to people, and when they ask for the modified code I'm running, I tell them I don't have to give them the modifications because I'm only running it on my server
[23:40:57] <ljharb> licensing only constrains distribution
[23:41:09] <ljharb> if i'm modifying for private use, the license on what i'm modifying is irrelevant
[23:41:15] <buu> blueagain: Well, it turns out that went poorly in practice and we had to pass lemon laws
[23:41:27] <blueagain> buu: that's what AGPL is for, no?
[23:41:59] <buu> blueagain: the agpl is attempting to make it easier for people to use otherwise gpl'd code without distributing their modifications, yes

[23:42:40] <buu> ljharb: are you quoting laws in an argument about morality
[23:42:45] <blueagain> But again, if AWS wants to take postgre and make money off while adding their own modifications, I don't see why we should force them to publish the modifications under the same license
[23:42:49] <ljharb> buu: GPL is about laws, not morality
[23:42:52] <ljharb> buu: so, yes?
[23:43:01] <buu> obviously, no, it isn't
[23:43:06] <ljharb> licensing is a legal thing
[23:43:08] <buu> The GPL is an attempt to use laws to enforce morality
[23:43:10] <ljharb> right
[23:43:14] <ljharb> which is what my comment was saying too
[23:43:18] <buu> But the *point* is the morality
[23:43:23] <ljharb> that everyone should have the right to modify their own purchases
[23:43:30] <buu> right
[23:43:33] <ljharb> the license on those things should be irrelevant; they should just have the right
[23:43:40] <ljharb> so, using GPL to attack that is counterproductive, it doesn't solve the root problem
[23:43:54] <buu> It's not perfect but it's better than mit
[23:43:59] <ljharb> i don't agree
[23:44:00] <blueagain> ljharb: largely agreed.
[23:44:04] <buu> I noticed
[23:44:18] <ljharb> i think that GPL was clever, but its time is done
[23:44:34] <ljharb> if we want to ensure people can modify things, we should pass laws that ensure that

[23:44:48] <ljharb> i should be able to modify *everything*, not just GPL things
[23:44:48] <blueagain> If I wrote desktop software though, I wouldn't mind publishing it under the GPL.
[23:45:12] <buu> ljharb: We're slightly more likely to be able to publish gpl software than we are to convince a congress to let us control our own computers though
[23:45:16] <blueagain> buu: why should they be forced to give something back? It was a gift.

[23:45:55] <buu> ljharb: you mean because they're such assholes?
[23:46:01] <ljharb> buu: i'm not saying we're close to getting it done, but there is a pretty strong push
[23:46:06] <blueagain> Besides, postgres has immensely benefitted from the community. But if they monetize some aspects of the software (like hosting, whatever), it's not like the contributors get shares.
[23:46:20] <ljharb> buu: they're only assholes if they lobby against those kinds of laws
[23:46:21] <blueagain> It's a give and take imho.
[23:46:23] <ljharb> right-to-repair or right-to-modify
[23:46:54] <blueagain> buu: I see it more as a gift. And gifts don't come with conditions.
[23:46:54] <buu> blueagain: Let me try a slightly tenuous example here, imagine I own a large chunk of land around my house, like, 5 square miles behind my house bordering a nice stream. There are paths from public roads and stuff through this land and "the public" enjoys walking through my land to get to the stream and picnic or whatever
[23:46:57] <ljharb> if something is permitted then a business is going to do it; the solution is to prohibit it, not vilify those that do what's permitted
[23:47:24] <buu> blueagain: But if someone walks through these paths and leaves 5000 beer cans in a pile someplace, this is bad
[23:47:44] <buu> blueagain: Me letting the public use my paths to enjoy the land is a "gift" but it also imposes recproical obligations
[23:47:48] <buu> reciprocal
[23:48:23] <blueagain> I don't know if that holds, because in the case of software, if one person uses it to do *bad* stuff, no one else is impacted.
[23:48:29] <blueagain> In your case, it is not the case.
[23:48:30] <buu> er
[23:48:41] <buu> well, that's not the moral argument I'm making
[23:48:58] <blueagain> But you can't compared shared physical spare to reproducible software where everyone is equal.
[23:49:02] <blueagain> space*
[23:49:04] <buu> blueagain: That's esentially the point, if I wanted my code to be 'a gift' it'd be in the public domain
[23:49:29] <buu> blueagain: But I want people to use my code/property with respect/kindness/goodness/etc, so it's not in the public domain it's "Free with obligations"
[23:49:39] <blueagain> buu: BSD/MIT is just the bare minimum to guarantee the *original* code is accessible to everyone.
[23:50:11] <blueagain> BSD/MIT is the *who* can do whatever he wants it, GPL is already *how*.
[23:50:12] <Betal> "the solution is to prohibit it", then software start to change licenses like mongodb?
[23:50:20] <buu> blueagain: Sure, so the question is, what is more free (or maximizes utility if you prefer), letting people hide their modifications or forcing them to reveal them?
[23:50:35] <ljharb> right - public domain doesn't hold up in court as well
[23:50:41] <ljharb> MIT already is basically "public domain"

[23:53:55] <ljharb> semantics are always the most important thing

[23:54:07] <jaawerth> I'm ok with that
[23:54:14] <blueagain> It's like math, as long as we know symbol A means the same thing, it's OK.
[23:55:09] <jaawerth> well, if you want to communicate clearly then it's probably wise to use a less weighted term than "liberarian", which is always going to come off very differently depending on the audience ;-)
