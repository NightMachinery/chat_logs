[00:04:55] *** Joins: guidoc (~guido@151.43.151.142)
[00:05:35] <da_wunder> and that same goes for eg. Symfony
[00:06:03] <Stanley> da_wunder wouldn't that apply to any web framework?
[00:06:13] <arash> da_wunder, I don't know. but what are those view , controller and model menus and files in laravel ?
[00:06:33] <da_wunder> arash: those are just namings - nothing else
[00:06:47] <da_wunder> Stanley: basically yes
[00:07:51] <Stanley> I mean, for arash's sake, I think it's safe to say laravel is MVC
[00:08:18] <da_wunder> arash: and that is the common mistake that people make - if something is just named like mvc - they think that the framework itself is mvc
[00:08:39] <da_wunder> Stanley: could you point to laravel doc where _they_ say that laravel is mvc framework?
[00:09:29] <arash> da_wunder, people suggest me to start learning laravel and they believe i should be familiar with mvc before start working with laravel. i know some php, html, js and i want to go to the next step with learning mvc.
[00:10:50] <da_wunder> arash: I would recommend you to just follow the official docs and guides and learn things that way - and also don't forget to try other php frameworks and compare those all and then make your _own_ decision which is the best for your use case
[00:11:33] <arash> da_wunder, ok. thank you
[00:11:37] <Stanley> I'm not saying Laravel claims it's MVC anywhere, but as far as what web frameworks do it's relatively standard no? request comes into controller that works with the models to manipulate the data and then returns a view
[00:12:37] <Stanley> when arash says "I should be familiar with mvc before" it's just how to separate the code, not a purely technical definition of MVC
[00:15:19] <Stanley>  da_wunder from everything I've read though taylor specifically says it's not MVC, despite the naming of everything
[00:15:25] <da_wunder> mvc pattern works really for standalone application, not applications like php - you make a request then your application response something - sure naming processing that request <--> response could be something similar like mvc - but in the base it's not mvc
[00:16:28] <da_wunder> that naming pattern has been adopted to web applications - nothing else, because the behaviour of application is totally different
[00:17:03] <Stanley> so mvc essentially has different meaning depending on context now

[00:18:13] <da_wunder> mvc framework vs mvc naming
[00:18:27] <Stanley> it's still a framework, just a different one
[00:18:36] <Stanley> no?
[00:19:18] <Stanley> don't all "mvc" web frameworks function in the same way? request comes into the controller that works with models and returns views?
[00:20:26] <da_wunder> so if you're really looking a mvc php framework - you should look those official docs and check if they claim to be mvc framework or not
[00:21:01] <da_wunder> biggest ones like symfony, laravel doesn't say that at all - because those aren't mvc frameworks
[00:21:22] <Stanley> yes I understand that but you're speaking as a very technical definition
[00:21:38] <Stanley> if you're in a group of web developers and you mention MVC what's going to be their response?
[00:22:11] <da_wunder> 22:28 < da_wunder> just realize that, php is not for mvc
[00:22:55] <Stanley> if you apply for a PHP job and they ask you what MVC is do you think they're looking for "it doesn't apply to PHP it's strictly for desktop applications" or "Request comes into Controller that works with the Models and returns a View"
[00:23:30] <da_wunder> huoh, let's agree to disagree then - this is pointless
[00:23:39] <Nomikos> ^^^
[00:24:30] <Stanley> sure
[00:27:32] <arash> PHP channel is always works that way! but I enjoy asking questions in here, it helped me a lot and finally with answers in here, my knowledge, wikipedia and google I can make a decision and decide what to do!
[00:33:20] <Stanley> arash tldr if someone told you to understand MVC before learning Laravel then they're referring to the MVC that exists within Laravel and the best way to learn it is the official laravel docs or Laravel 8 from Scratch at Laracasts

[00:55:35] <kuhilas> I am trying to set a variable to zero and I check var_dump() it and it shows: string(0) ""  I am setting it like: if (!isset($palkka[$i])) $palkka[$i] = 0; When I check the sql query string it is empty and not showing 0
[00:55:51] <kuhilas> if var_dump shows that, is it "not set"?
[00:56:35] <TinoDidriksen> isset() checks that the variable is not null. An empty string is not null, so it wouldn't be changed by that line.
[00:57:15] <Nomikos> yep, and empty string "" is a valid value
[00:57:18] <TinoDidriksen> You may be looking for empty(), but be careful that it thinks many things are empty, including "0"
[00:57:40] <kuhilas> if I am given a variable with that content, what's the best way to change its value to integer 0?
[00:58:09] <TinoDidriksen> It sounds like you want empty() instead of isset(), but check the docs.
[00:58:22] <kuhilas> my sql is in strict mode and it doesn't accept "" values so I have to do changes. The field is an integer field so I would want to set it to 0
[00:59:30] <TinoDidriksen> You could just do $palkka[$i] = intval($palkka[$i]); then.
[00:59:47] <kuhilas> does empty() also include cases where the value is not set at all
[01:00:29] <__adrian> https://php.net/empty
[01:01:56] <__adrian> are you passing data via parameters?
[01:03:39] *** Parts: Poboy (~Poboy@user/poboy) ()
[01:04:26] <kuhilas> yup the empty() at least works in this case. The php.net/intval doesn't show "" in its examples to turn it into integer 0 but yeah if it's the case then I guess..
[01:04:48] <__adrian> asking because this is all likely the non-ideal solution
[01:04:50] <kuhilas> There's a function that gets the variable in its parameter if that's what you mean
[01:05:26] <kuhilas> ye it's some old bad software that I just have to fix something to make it work with sql in strict mode
[01:06:16] <__adrian> i mean do you use  prepare()  with  ? or :parameter
[01:06:27] <kuhilas> I will go with the empty() for now thanks :)

[01:09:52] <__adrian> "kuhilas> it doesn't accept "" ... so I would want to set it to 0"  specifically this; it depends on whether you're looking for a _default_ value or a "no value" value. it sounds like you're talking about a "no value" value, which is NOT 0. it's null

[18:09:46] <jtomas> hi, when put this snippet https://hastebin.com/ajasuxixeh.php into this file https://github.com/wpovernight/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/blob/master/templates/Simple/invoice.php it completely fails the php. The only thing to matter seems the token `$this->shipping_method("shipping_method")`. When it appears, it gets printed. Neither h3, nor the if condition get evaluated properly. After reading the docs a bit, i've found out
[18:09:46] <jtomas> that putting `add_action( 'wpo_wcpdf_after_order_details', 'wpo_wcpdf_custom_stuff', 10, 2 );` in functions.php and moving the previous logic to `wpo_wcpdf_custom_stuff` it worked. However, I would like to understand why the former way did not work at all

[20:31:22] <FloridaMan> Does anybody have a good video tutorial resource for someone (like me) who came from PHP before its object-oriented days and just wants to brush up on the OOP parts?
[20:32:00] <FloridaMan> I keep finding tutorials for absolute newbies and I'm not that, I just want to make sure I have the OOP side of it down.
[20:33:31] <FloridaMan> I'm running into a lot of tutorials like "this is a variable" and all that complete beginner stuff.
[20:33:45] <BadAdviceCat> FloridaMan, after understanding how to create an object, and then how to call methods on it and assign variables which are stored inside your object, there is not much else to learn about it.
[20:33:59] <__adrian> i don't have a particular video recommendation (i don't tend to work that way), but don't limit yourself to "php" oop. oop ideas are not language-specific.
[20:34:03] <BadAdviceCat> What remains will be guidelines on how to make the code flexible.
[20:34:11] <FloridaMan> yeah I'm more concerned with the syntax and keywords than anything
[20:34:19] <__adrian> the php-specific part is the syntax, which you can learn at https://php.net/oop
[20:34:23] <BadAdviceCat> Ah, so you're not there yet.
[20:34:29] <FloridaMan> __adrian: thanks!
[20:34:34] <__adrian> welcome
[20:35:17] <BadAdviceCat> FloridaMan, it's important to run the code as you read. Then changing the code slightly to see what breaks, what's allowed, and what's not allowed. :)
[20:35:23] <BadAdviceCat> With that said, happy coding.
[20:35:32] <FloridaMan> yeah last time I touched PHP professionally was in 2010 right around the time OO PHP was becoming a thing
[20:35:54] <__adrian> so php.net is step 1
[20:36:06] <__adrian> but step 0 is "forget EVERYTHING you learned about oop in php 4"
[20:36:13] <FloridaMan> I'm "one of those people" that came from WordPress theming and plugins way back in the day heh
[20:36:13] <da_wunder> ^
[20:37:09] <da_wunder> I remember start with php3 :D
[20:37:12] <FloridaMan> my major concern now is that I can take existing code and modify it without any issue, but I can't exactly build new classes from scratch
[20:37:12] <__adrian> wp "uses objects" but is not "object-oriented code"
[20:37:34] <__adrian> keep that in mind too. using objects ‚â† object oriented
[20:37:46] <FloridaMan> it's just a simple matter of learning the syntax and little gotchas, which I think __adrian's link points me to nicely
[20:38:46] <FloridaMan> __adrian: yeah since 2010 I've been doing a lot of various OOP stuff, first with Java, then with Ruby, then somewhat OOP with Go
[20:38:51] <da_wunder> FloridaMan: also check what php version you're running because there has been some major changes since 2010
[20:38:53] <FloridaMan> so I'm familiar with the OOP conceptual side
[20:39:25] <FloridaMan> I have a technical interview later tonight so I'm brushing up on the actual PHP-specific stuff
[20:44:51] <FloridaMan> thanks for all the pointers :)
[20:44:58] <FloridaMan> (no pun intended)
[20:45:49] <__adrian> no pun taken
[20:45:53] <__adrian> (php doesn't have pointers)

[22:55:15] <FloridaMan> so what's the deal with sometimes functions being defined with typed parameters and typed return values, and sometimes untyped?
[22:55:31] <FloridaMan> Is it just whether you feel like typing them or something?
[22:55:44] <__adrian> no
[22:55:46] <__adrian> use types
[22:55:50] <FloridaMan> ok
[22:56:00] <FloridaMan> in the manual I see some examples of both, that's what got me wondering

[22:57:09] <Naktibalda> before PHP 5.0 ?
[22:57:09] <da_wunder> you should always use types, but according to your php version it might be different what you could use and what not
