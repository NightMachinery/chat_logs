[00:48:43] <Galois> In terms of technical content and raw symbol manipulation, commutative algebra fits in undergrad, but the perspective as to why you would want to learn this symbol manipulation comes from grad topics

[00:59:06] <Galois> there's two answers. Doing the drills is one thing. You can pass the class easily, sure. Learning the math is quite another. And commutative algebra is the tip of a vast iceberg of unseen math. How much of that bulk you see is what determines the superficial difficulty.
[00:59:18] <Galois> Eventually you should see all of it, but that's too overwhelming for a beginning student.
[01:00:33] <pi0> question when proving big theta the constants c1 c2 and k are elements of natural numbers?
[01:00:52] <pi0> and natural starting from 1 not 0?
[01:01:25] <zincy_> do all equivalence relations give rise to quotient maps?
[01:01:57] <Galois> if you mean equivalence relations on sets, yes.
[01:02:13] <zincy_> Yes
[01:02:20] <Galois> here's an unrelated thing but it gives an idea of what I mean. Consider this formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_four-square_identity#Algebraic_identity
[01:02:31] <Galois> ok it's easy enough to check that formula using high school algebra. Is that hard? No, it's not hard.
[01:02:59] <Galois> but if you really want to understand what's actually going on, you need something like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_four-square_identity#Proof_of_the_identity_using_quaternions which is a little bit harder

[01:03:33] <Galois> now commutative algebra is like that, except that the "little bit harder" part takes you practically to the frontiers of current research
[01:03:51] <zincy_> Galois: I see that quotient maps need to be open maps, does that mean I can have a quotient map which is open under any topology?
[01:04:34] <zincy_> I am confused about where quotient maps fit into the quotient topology
[01:04:38] <Galois> oh now you're saying equivalent relations on topological spaces instead of on sets
[01:04:43] <Galois> equivalence
[01:04:46] <zincy_> Yeah
[01:04:52] <zincy_> Sorry
[01:05:36] <Galois> the answer is still yes. You define the quotient topology so that the properties you state are satisfied.
[01:06:50] <econo> hm ya i'm not a big fan of symbol pushing without intuition
[01:07:08] <zincy_> So is the quotient topology defined so as to make the quotient map continous?
[01:07:27] <Galois> "In topology and related areas of mathematics, the quotient space of a topological space under a given equivalence relation is a new topological space constructed by endowing the quotient set of the original topological space with the quotient topology, that is, with the finest topology that makes continuous the canonical projection map."
[01:08:10] *** Quits: Jordy (~jordy@user/jordy) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:08:37] <zincy_> So you could have a canonical projection map which projects to a quotient set
[01:08:49] <TheHermann> hi
[01:08:49] <zincy_> And at this point you would not have a topological space
[01:08:56] <TheHermann> what does mean log_state in spass?. it can be satisfiable, unsatisfidable and unknown
[01:09:11] <Galois> the quotient space by definition is a topological space whose underlying set is the quotient set

[01:09:51] <zincy_> Ah okay so it is the *only* topology that is used for quotient sets
[01:10:05] <Galois> by the way it is not true that all equivalence relations on all objects give rise to quotient maps, even if the object itself has a set structure. For example you can't just impose an arbitrary equivalence relation on a group and expect the resulting quotient set to be a group.
[01:10:29] <Galois> theoretically you could have some other topology on a quotient set but you would have to specify what topology you mean in that case
[01:10:40] <Galois> the "quotient topology" is as stated above, the finest topology making projection continuous

[01:21:58] <Galois> perhaps you can also prove that this quotient topology is NOT the subspace topology, so that your earlier confusion of the two was indeed a nontrivial error

[03:59:58] <greenbagels> boy was i wrong
[04:00:56] <brownorange> i agree that ~G -> ~Cons(F), but G -> ~Cons(F) as well. if by assuming G we mean to evaluate its truth that means processing provability from somewhere. i'm not convinced PA proves G or disproves G.
[04:05:52] <int-e> Well, it doesn't unless it's inconsistent.
[04:06:43] <int-e> Ah, I messed up earlier. The basic principle at play here is Prov_F(T) --> Prov_F(Prov_F(T)).
[04:07:43] <int-e> So since G_F <--> ~Prov(G_F), we have ~G_F --> Prov(G_F) --> Prov(~Prov(G_F)) but also Prov(G_F) -> Prov(Prov(G_F)), which taken together gives Prov(_|_).

[04:08:35] <PlanckWalk> Oh no, this bunch of misconceptions again.
[04:10:21] <int-e> It's difficult stuff, but "I believe this must all be wrong" isn't the right approach to understanding it.
[04:10:22] <brownorange> It seems the second incompleteness theorem relies on the first incompleteness theorem accepting G's unprovability as some self-evident truth.
[04:10:51] <int-e> It's not about truth.
[04:10:57] <int-e> It's about provability.
[04:11:38] <brownorange> provability is limited by the axiomatic truths you assume though.
[04:12:08] <int-e> The /only/ element of truth in here is the semantic interpretation of the formula Prov_F(T) as actual provability of T; and that relies on having a standard model where the natural numbers are just that, no non-standard numbers allowed.
[04:12:36] <int-e> In a non-standard model this semantic interpretation is no longer valid.
[04:13:09] <brownorange> self-reference allows us to speak about provability , but it's still a truth predicate isn't it?
[04:13:10] <int-e> So G_F can be true or false depending on the choice of model, and the same thing is true for Cons(F).
[04:13:28] <int-e> It's a predicate.
[04:13:36] <int-e> As in, a formula with one free variable.
[04:14:12] <brownorange> how does proving Cons(F) in F, lock us in to a model? where's the fixed point justification for that

[04:16:25] <brownorange> if you aren't locked into a model how does "F |- Cons(F) -> Gf"  occur? as it would seem for F to prove "Cons(F)->Gf" would require either of G,~G
[04:17:40] <int-e> F |- Cons(F) -> G_F means that we can prove Cons(F) --> G_F inside the formal system F.
[04:18:43] <int-e> This really isn't hard if you cleanly separate meta level (reasoning *about* F) and the formal level (reasoning inside the system F).

[04:35:00] <brownorange> point is if you accept the liar sentence is true on the metalevel, then true proves the liar sentence
[04:35:17] <int-e> ?
[04:35:35] <brownorange> if the liar sentence is actually true, then True imply it. Because true implies all true things
[04:36:27] <int-e> If by "liar sentence" you mean Gödel's sentence... nowhere is that assumed to be true.

[06:31:44] <Decker> https://gist.github.com/d3x0r/81e257e76888b2275a587b69765e65d1  So I implemented that here, to take a cross product and complete the matrix; it works for 3D vectors that it generates a rotation matrix which for AxB rotates A to B or B to A and it works; and the rows and columns are all unit vectors...
[06:33:48] *** Joins: Carbonflux (~Carbonflu@c-66-235-54-179.sea.wa.customer.broadstripe.net)
[06:34:04] <Decker> but when I add a W component, then the rows/columns aren't quite 1; I can get the W by computing sqrt(1-(xx+yy+zz)) which I do have x y and z axis components - and that should work for 4D to get the 'W' axis (which isn't any of the wx wy or wz components...) But then even the w rows especially are only like 0.53 length

[12:52:09] <pokhu> pikapika: you need 2 angles to get the axis in the right position and you have another angle to rotate around the axis. at least i think that was what you meant by the question.
[12:52:13] <PlanckWalk> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation
[12:52:36] <pikapika> We can use two spherical angles to get to any new oritentaiton
[12:53:33] <pokhu> but you only need 1 spherical and 1 circular
[12:53:53] <pikapika> two numbers in total that is
[12:53:54] <white2> the Euler rotation is not just rotating axes but also things in it

[12:55:50] <PlanckWalk> That's inefficient

[13:03:07] <pokhu> yes
[13:03:12] <PlanckWalk> If you consider only rotations about a given fixed point O, then it's n(n-1)/2

[13:04:00] <pikapika> wait, what I described is actually still rigid
[13:05:45] <pokhu> if you think of trying to move 3 unit vectors in real life, like a frame, when youre rotating the i vector, lets say with respect to some ground/fixed vector (not k) then the other 2 are free to move with respect to gravity and so move to the lowest position. you would need more information, the angle about the rotated i unit vector, in order to fix them in place as well
[13:06:25] <pokhu> or else youd only be able to describe frames with j and k closest to the ground, but thats only fixed by i, so in reality youre only describing the rotations of a single vector
[13:07:08] <pikapika> If the other two axes don't move along with the i then its not really rigid

[13:09:41] <pokhu> i think im imagining what youre saying, i meant holding a vertice made out of metal, only the end. the other two axes move along with i, when i said fixed i meant they're completely determined by the choice of the i vector, since they choose the orientation with the least potential energy

[13:14:31] <pikapika> Wait
[13:14:36] <pikapika> I think I am starting to understand now
[13:15:02] <pikapika> We are first aligning one axes to the corresponding target axis
[13:15:13] <pikapika> Two rotations (spherical for example)
[13:15:22] <pikapika> However there is no gauarantee the other two axes are aligned to their target axes as well
[13:15:30] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)

[18:41:57] <lericson> question, a square is 3x3 m^2 or 3x3 m? i would say it's 3x3 m and 9 m^2, but that's because i read it as "3 by 3 meters" whereas "3 by 3 square meters" sounds weird
[18:42:16] <lericson> i suppose 3 m x 3 m is the least controversial
[18:42:26] <riv> 3m * 3m = 3^2 m^2
