[00:16:21] <glow8> Hi! I saw an article of mine on the site (https://lobste.rs/s/bnl4su), so I figured I'd register and post them in the future myself. But it's invitation-only, so I was wondering how many souls do I have to gather in order to get one? Otherwise I can offer a first-born and a half. Anyone interested?
[00:17:17] <pe> You offer halfves?
[00:17:31] <cot> glow8: : I can invite you, can you PM me the eamil you'd like me to send the invite to?

[04:00:07] <bkero> why would you want to install local software from a VPN provider?
[04:00:51] <rb> reminds me when i need to top it up, also makes it easy to switch around
[04:01:17] <rb> martian67|: currently fighting with a weird build error where running cargo directly works, but running it through their build.sh doesn't, because it can't find libnftnl
[04:01:39] <martian67|> bkero, it has a nice interface for switching servers, and is open source
[04:01:42] <rb> bkero: it's FOSS so i don't see the problem :^)
[04:01:44] <martian67|> you don't need it
[04:01:58] <martian67|> but its handy, and shockingly actually integrates well with system level stuff like NetworkManager
[04:02:12] <bkero> Doesn't NetworkManager have a nice interface for switching endpoints?
[04:02:15] <martian67|> it doesn't just built its own little model of reality
[04:02:18] <rb> yah nm-applet tells me that i'm connected to a vpn
[04:02:34] <martian67|> bkero, not that i've seen at least
[04:02:42] <bkero> nmtui, nmcli, nm-applet, and gnome-control-center
[04:02:49] <bkero> You might want to check closer :)
[04:02:49] <martian67|> what of them?
[04:02:57] <bkero> They all have interfaces for switching VPN endpoints
[04:03:14] <martian67|> so what? a big giant list isn't very helpful
[04:03:28] <martian67|> you want stuff categorized, and with a map maybe
[04:03:34] <bkero> lol
[04:04:25] <martian67|> the point of the mulvad UI thing is to provide that, per country, per protocol, with ports and stuff
[04:05:20] <bkero> I guess if you need a map of countries so you can click on one, you found a service specifically for people like yourself
[04:08:36] <rb> doesn't show a map, it shows you a list but whatever, if you're gonna have an attitude like that then it's not worth discussing
[04:08:55] <bkero> But I thought big giant lists weren't helpful?
[04:09:00] <bkero> Maybe it's a nested list.
[04:09:03] <rb> yes
[04:09:23] <rb> it categories by country city and then individual servers
[04:09:58] <bkero> Is that worth having a big honking electron app installed and running?
[04:10:28] <rb> for me yes. i wish it was less electron-y, but it works
[04:10:30] <rb> pragmatism > bloat
[04:10:56] <rb> once built, it Just Works so meh
[04:10:59] <bkero> A big lists works too, with less bloat.
[04:11:10] <bkero> I wish it had nested lists, but it works
[04:11:34] <bkero> A big list*
[04:11:48] <rb> sure, if you'd like to dig through names like se27-wireguard without knowing which one connects to which, or having to manually set that up
[04:12:28] <bkero> Ouch it sounds like the name of endpoints they give out isn't human-readable
[04:12:36] <bkero> Better solve that with an electron app
[04:12:51] <rb> nice hyperbole bro
[04:13:10] <bkero> Thanks
[04:13:14] <martian67|> i mean you are free to use your big list, nobody cares
[04:13:29] <bkero> "Better solve that with an electron app" is the most common response of 202X
[04:13:46] <martian67|> im sorry that other people using software they like offends you
[04:13:50] <martian67|> maybe you should get over it
[04:13:52] <rb> and it doesn't apply here, because it doesn't just allow you to pick from a list, it also has many other options
[04:14:17] <rb> stuff like setting up custom DNS servers, ipv6 tunneling, blocking internet access when not tunneling, etc. a bunch of options
[04:14:27] <rb> also reminds you when 3 or less days of credit are left
[04:14:31] <rb> can NetworkManager do that for me?
[04:15:04] <rb> but sure it's BLOAT because all that matters of a program is its size, features be damned

[23:00:33] <Brekkjern> pushcx: May I petition to have that "Why was Facebook down for five hours?" video un-deleted? The Facebook outage is only the frame he uses to explain how DNS and routing/BGP works except for a 5 minute section at the end. It's not really the meat of the video.
[23:01:55] <Brekkjern> The video is excellent at explaining how recursive DNS lookups and networking works, and it would be a shame for it to not be viewed just because it contains a section about the Facebook outage.
[23:01:59] <pushcx> It should come back because the title is clickbait? That's not really encouraging.
[23:02:33] <imode> I agree that the title is clickbait, but IMO the actual demo of the BGP peering and network setup is worth that.
[23:03:10] <imode> he actually constructs a live demo with a bunch of routers pretending to be various geolocated ISPs and how they're linked into facebook's network.
[23:03:16] <imode> as well as demonstrating how an outage could occur.
[23:04:59] <Brekkjern> The title isn't inaccurate. It's just not the only thing the video is about.

[23:09:46] <riv> im getting tired of this thing they make every youtuber do, go on about "subscribe and hit the bell and blah blah"
[23:09:57] <Brekkjern> I used the frontpage to find videos from new creators. Now it's just a trashfire
[23:10:13] <companion_cube> amirouche: but often the SQL DBs are the ones with ACID guarantees, in practice, no?

[23:16:32] <gerikson> ``New College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1379 by William of Wykeham''
[23:16:39] <varjag> if you expect the project to be a success, how can you possibly think it's a good idea
[23:16:52] <Brekkjern> An organization I am a part of had a server, then they got a new one so it was called "new.<domain>". Then we got a newer server, so that one was called "wen.<domain>" (wen being the reverse of new). Then we got a new server, and we stood around scratching our heads deciding what to call it, and just decided on "xen.<domain>"
[23:17:12] <Brekkjern> So, yeah... Never use "New" in the name of anything. Just ask Microsoft.
[23:17:29] <gerikson> ``Like many of Oxford's colleges, New College admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after six centuries as an institution for men only.''
[23:17:37] <drobilla> Use "old" instead.  Very forward-thinking
[23:18:03] <varjag> ye olde
[23:18:12] <companion_cube> don't use new, use unique_ptr
[23:18:14] <rbasak> Because if you're successful, then "old" will become correct? :)
