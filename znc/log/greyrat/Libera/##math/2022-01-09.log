[00:10:54] <Decker> I do have the old code in the git history; what the first steps were was just getting matrix from the rotation axis/angle, the first was yaw; so rotate the x and z matrix parts by some angle - in a bi-vector sort of way; and get the axis-angle back from that.
[00:11:40] <Decker> and these are just parpendicular axis so maybe I can fake it

[03:48:29] <Guest11> by using trig identities you can eliminate the coscos and sinsin, but that still leaves you with one equation and two unknowns
[03:48:39] <Guest11> you'd need to do something with c
[03:49:49] <lf94> int-e: it is 2D and I do care
[03:50:07] <lf94> Actually no

[03:50:34] <lf94> int-e: do I have to normalize the lines?
[03:52:15] <int-e> lf94: Well a.b = |a||b|cos(phi), phi being the angle between the vectors (either the normals of the lines or direction vectors work)... so you have to divide by |a||b|. If you normalize, they're both 1.
[03:53:06] <int-e> Guest11: the c features a double angle formula
[03:53:55] <lf94> Im just trying to find the angle, so I guess it doesnt matter

[06:04:35] <nutritionfacts1> A polynomial is defined as a formal object. I understand that it's defined as a formal object because we want to treat the indeterminate as a symbol, but what about the coefficients? It seems that coefficients are also used formally. Given 5x, are we treating 5 as a numeral, i.e., a formal object, or as a number? So 5x should be viewed as the

[06:07:01] <Z-module> And you don't actually need the formal symbols. It's possible (though not really done in practice) to define a polynomial over a commutative ring S as any function N -> S  (where N = {0,1,2,...}) that is 0 for all but finitely many n in N.
[06:07:25] <Z-module> so the function's value at each n is just the coefficient for x^n  in this formalism.
[06:08:10] <Z-module> and then polyinomial addition is just function addition pointwise, and multiplication is the usual Cauchy convolution thing.

[06:09:20] <nutritionfacts1> That's what I find confusing. The polynomial is defined as a formal object, but its coefficients come from some ring, let's say. Those seem to be contradictory statements to me. A formal object has to be treated as meaningless symbols. I've seen books define polynomials differently, but I'd like to understand the formal object definition.
[06:09:20] <Z-module> This genearlizes very nicely to the full formal power series ring S[[x]], where the functions no longer have to be 0 at almost all n.
[06:10:32] <Z-module> Really S[x] is just the commutative ring you get by introducing a brand new symbol x to the comm. ring S, with no relations at all other than x also  commuting with everything.
[06:10:38] <johnkeats6> nutritionfacts1, if you dislike the symbol definition you can just define a polynomial to be a sequence of coefficients (which is required to be eventually all 0's)
[06:10:56] <johnkeats6> that's the more direct set-theoretic construction
[06:11:15] <johnkeats6> i see Z-module said that already
[06:11:25] <PlanckWalk> nutritionfacts1: The *variables* of the polynomial are formal symbols.

[06:13:52] <PlanckWalk> As opposed to, say, polynomial *functions*
[06:14:21] <PlanckWalk> Where the variable is meaningful in that it takes values.
[06:14:47] <PlanckWalk> And for example, in Z_2 the polynomial *functions* x and x^2 are identical.

[06:17:44] <PlanckWalk> The exact meaning of terms like "formal object" vary with context.
[06:18:35] <Z-module> The formal part in "formal object", for a polyonomial over a ring S, is really just in treating each power of x as distinct, each with a single coefficient from S, with the usual convolution for multiplication. But the addition and mult. of things in S is just those from S itself, whatever ring that is.
[06:19:15] <Z-module> but this is doable over any comm. ring S whatsoever, including another polynomial ring
[06:19:18] <PlanckWalk> "formal object" can just mean "the form is relevant"
[06:20:09] <nutritionfacts1> For context, in Farleigh a polynomial is defined as an "infinite formal sum" a_0+a_1*x+a_2*x^2 + ..., where the coefficients are in a ring and a_i = 0 for all but finite number of values of i.
[06:20:28] <Z-module> and you can do these with several indeterminates instead of the single x -- even infinitely many.
[06:20:31] <PlanckWalk> Right, that fits.
[06:21:03] <PlanckWalk> The form matters, not just the results if you evaluated it.
[06:21:41] <PlanckWalk> (or even whether you can evaluate it)
[06:22:13] <Z-module> nutritionfacts1: there are many equivalent ways.
[06:22:57] <PlanckWalk> In particular, the things being "summed" there *are not ring elements*.
[06:22:58] <nutritionfacts1> Z-module: I don't follow what you mean. If a polynomial is defined as a formal sum, then it seems to me that we're meant to treat the coefficients formally as well.
[06:23:52] <Z-module> not really, nutritionfacts1. Polynomial rings are a way of building certain useful extension rings from commutative rings.

[06:27:46] <PlanckWalk> a + b x  is equal to  c + d x  iff  a = c and b = d.
[06:28:20] <nutritionfacts1> When I think of formal objects, or formal sums, I think of formal systems, where you may have a sequence of meaningless symbols. For example, I could have a set of all binary sequences aababbabba, abbba, etc. These have no meaning. They're formal objects. My understanding of a formal polynomial is similar. I see 5x as symbol 5 followed by symbol x.
[06:28:21] <nutritionfacts1> I see no number in 5x.
[06:28:45] <PlanckWalk> Your understanding of polynomial isn't quite right then
[06:29:14] <Z-module> Polynomials are a part of commutative ring theory, not formal languages per se.
[06:29:42] <nutritionfacts1> I find it hard to square what I just said with the fact that 5 belongs to a ring of integers, unless I go full formalist and say everything is a formal object (set) anyway.
[06:29:54] <PlanckWalk> Go less full formalist instead :-p
[06:30:12] <nutritionfacts1> PlanckWalk: I'm trying :)  I'm not sure how.
[06:30:21] <Z-module> Even '5' can have many different meanings: it's simply 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, where the '+' is the addition of whatever ring we are over.
[06:30:32] <Z-module> In some rings that sum is actually 0.
[06:30:39] <PlanckWalk> Start with not taking "formal sum" to mean "meaningless string of symbols"
[06:30:52] <PlanckWalk> It just means "sumk in which the form matters"
[06:30:55] <PlanckWalk> sum*
[06:31:48] <PlanckWalk> As opposed to an ordinary sum which just has a value resulting from *evaluating* the sum.
[06:32:56] <PlanckWalk> Maybe another way to say the same thing: "formal sum" is applying the adjective "formal" to the noun "sum".
[06:33:24] <PlanckWalk> I.e. it's the *sum* part of the expression that's formal, not absolutely everything about the expression.
[06:34:33] <PlanckWalk> But really, that's probably too overly specific.

[06:39:50] <PlanckWalk> nutritionfacts1: Technically the term "formal" in your definition is only applied to the word "sum"
[06:41:12] <nutritionfacts1> mycroftiv: Making things formal though allows you to not have to deal with meaning, which can be difficult. You call x a formal object, and that means to deal with it like a symbol. You don't have to understand what x _really_ means. My confusion comes from the fact that I think formal sum means the entire object is formal, which I am told may not
[06:41:12] <nutritionfacts1> be the case. But I don't see how parts of the polynomial can be formal, and others not.
[06:41:22] <PlanckWalk> So if you're inclined to think of "formal" as meaning that the thing that is "formal" is just a bunch of symbols, then you should only think of that as referring to the *sum* symbols.

[07:25:35] <nutritionfacts1> mycroftiv: Could you say more?
[07:25:59] <loller_> shouldn't the inverse Fourier transform on the right side result in the function e^(-alpha*m*r)?
[07:26:02] <PlanckWalk> They're concepts, therefore in our *models* of the world not the world itself (except in the sense that we are part of the world)
[07:26:08] <mycroftiv> nutritionfacts1: i do formal mathematics in type theory on a computer, but its not in my opinion different than doing informal math, or doing formal set theory on paper, and maybe the easiest way to say it is that platonism is

[07:28:41] <mycroftiv> so im agreeing with PlanckWalk on all this btw
[07:28:53] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes we consider purely formal mathematics, but it's not different in principle.
[07:29:23] <PlanckWalk> It just means we're studying the concepts that are syntactic rules more than other concepts.
[07:29:48] <mycroftiv> if we have some piece of 'informal math' that we are discussing in words conceptually, we can  take that informal math and make it formalized in any of several systems and represent the same meaning

[07:32:39] <loller_> well I think my issue was seeing 1/r as a variable, when in the inverse Fourier transform on the right it's actually a constant

[07:33:11] <mefistofeles> ok, I see

[07:35:10] <XCode> my question
[07:35:21] <nutritionfacts1> I'm sympathetic to formal mathematics as the only kind of mathematics that makes sense. Once you start talking about Platonism, and mathematical objects existing in some world, it becomes wishy-washy. Reasoning about mathematical objects platonically seems to be analogous to doing geometrical proofs with pictures. Meaning, the pictures are not
[07:35:22] <nutritionfacts1> actual proofs, but they are a helpful guide.
[07:35:53] <loller_> mefistofeles: when in fact what they show on the right becomes const*e^(-alpha*m*r)

[07:36:08] <mefistofeles> loller_: ah I see what you mean
[07:36:11] <mycroftiv> nutritionfacts1: so youd probably believe in the value of constructive mathematics in a typed proof assistant just like linked in agda. it provides specific computational evidence for proofs and you can extract any relevant numeric data
[07:36:48] <mycroftiv> if you dont add classical postulates, you dont even have controversial axioms like Choice or excluded middle, its only what you can definitively compute in finite time
[07:36:48] <johnkeats6> formalism is just a bad philosophy
[07:36:51] <johnkeats6> it has so many flaws
[07:37:28] <mycroftiv> johnkeats6: it may be a bad philosophy, but as a method of working, it has some value, since mathematicians generally do accept computer formalized deductions from standard libraries of proofs
[07:37:45] <PlanckWalk> nutritionfacts1: False dichotomy, there are more options.
[07:38:03] <mycroftiv> you dont have to believe that truth is *only* formal to see that most people agree formally establishing things does demonstrate something useful
[07:38:05] <nutritionfacts1> johnkeats6: Is the brain not doing formal mathematics when it thinks it's doing something else?
[07:38:47] <johnkeats6> yes by formalism i don't mean proving things i mean the idea that only formal mathematics has any validity or interest
[07:39:03] <mycroftiv> johnkeats6: very much agreed from me
[07:39:22] <PlanckWalk> The brain is mostly not doign formal mathematics even when it thinks it *is* doing formal mathematics.
[07:39:24] <johnkeats6> for starters a formalist never has any reason to believe their axiomatic system is consistent
[07:39:26] <mycroftiv> i just lean on formal tools because im not well trained and im sloppy on paper
[07:39:44] <johnkeats6> so.. why even bother
[07:40:08] <mycroftiv> most people including formalists think peano is 'obviously consistent'
[07:40:33] <mycroftiv> that is like the universal starting place of agreement for most people that arent either ultrafinitist or crankish
[07:41:01] <johnkeats6> we can only agree because of our intuition about a platonistic 1,2,3,4,5,... not because of any formal argument
[07:41:31] <mycroftiv> makes sense to me, although im happier to point to physical experience and sense data of regular object behavior than platonism

[08:36:08] <nutritionfacts1> I'm not aware of any math textbook that goes into the nuances of what it actually means when ZFC says the reals are uncountable. Is it safe to assume most mathematics students understand that result to be as real as a physical law? Math popularizers often muddy the waters here.
[08:37:26] <int-e> this is really not worth dwelling on; you get the same math whether you consider it to be real or not

One language, A, would be used to talk about a mathematics that's closer to what we can accept philosophically, and another language, B, about a mathematics that doesn't care about anything accept assuming a set of axioms and deriving
[08:52:20] <nutritionfacts1> theorems. In language A, "the reals are uncountable" would not make any sense, for example. In language B, it would be a perfectly reasonable statement. I'll grant you that it becomes complicated, since people may choose different philosophies.

[09:42:43] <mycroftiv> so using them, we can make structure preserving maps where logical truth is the same in the model as the original, by using these sets of voters to decide what is true, mathematically its a homomorphism using the quotient relative to the ultrafilter
[09:43:32] <mycroftiv> two things may not be exactly the same, but the ultrafilter tells us they are 'close enough'

[18:39:54] <arseniiv> I think I accidentally found an argument for pi against tau (ow). Consider the 2d space for simplicity. Rotation to n π Z multiplies a vector by +1 if n is even and by −1 if n is odd. There is a long-standing association between 0, 1 (mod 2) additive and ±1 multiplicative even/oddness and tau doesn’t entertain it in this case
[18:40:07] <arseniiv> that hurts a bit

[18:47:17] <isekaijin> Does it matter that much? I like pi because the zeroes of sin are the integer multiples of pi. If you are going to replace pi, replace it with a constant meaning pi/2, so that the zeroes of sin (resp. cos) are its even (resp. odd) multiples.

[20:43:45] <Z-module> by the way, cadmio, if you take the "multiset" of all occurring element orders in a finite group G (that is, each order that occurs, and the # of different elements having that order), this does determine G completely up to isomorphism if G is assumed abelian, but not in general. But even in the abelian case, you need the full list in general, not just the max order with its multiplicity.

[22:12:43] <dude12312414> A*x'^2 + B*y'^2 + C*x'*y' + (2Ah + Ck + D)x' + (2Bk + Ch + E)y' + Ah^2 + Bk^2 + Chk + Dh + Ek + F = 0
[22:13:08] <dude12312414> you want to make the linear terms (those with x' and y') have zero coefficients
[22:13:14] <dude12312414> so you have two equations
[22:13:20] <dude12312414> 2Ah + Ck + D = 0
[22:13:26] <dude12312414> 2Bk + Ch + E = 0
[22:13:31] <dude12312414> solve for h and k
[22:13:40] <dude12312414> in terms of A, B, C, D, E
[22:14:02] <dude12312414> same idea with 3 variables, it's just messier and you have a 3x3 system to solve
[22:15:01] <Guest11> what i'm confused by here is  why are you able to disregard the rotation

[22:15:16] <dude12312414> i'm not disregarding the rotation, it's still there
[22:15:35] <dude12312414> and now that you have h and k, your ellipsoid in the new variables looks like A'x'^2 + B'y'^2 + C'x'y' + D' = 0

[22:16:56] <Guest11> hang on
[22:16:57] <dude12312414> this ellipse is centered at (0, 0), so the translation part is removed and you are left figuring out the rotation
[22:18:02] <Guest11> what i'm struggling with here is why is it okay to set the linear terms to zero
[22:18:13] <Guest11> I would think the linear terms have a component of both rotation and translation
[22:18:31] *** Joins: esther (~esther@24-155-112-236.dyn.grandenetworks.net)
[22:19:00] <Decker> the transform is radial
[22:19:01] <dude12312414> you're choosing the values of h, k, l so that the linear terms become zero. It's a change of coordinates into one that is more convenient to work with as it is aligned to the center of the ellipsoid)

[22:20:44] <Guest11> hang on let me try something
[22:21:32] <Guest11> https://www.maa.org/external_archive/joma/Volume8/Kalman/General.html
[22:22:00] <Guest11> ok, looks like their generalized (non-translated) but rotated ellipse has no linear terms in it
[22:22:07] <Guest11> so I guess you're right, that's valid
[22:23:23] <Decker> could complicate it more - and use 3 angles instead of 2... there's fewer places there's combinations of the 3.  The angle around the X/Y or Z axis... rather than an angle from a pole and an angle of rotation around the sphere
[22:24:04] <Guest11> @dec
[22:24:31] <Guest11> Decker If you're responding to me, the other potential rotation is completely ambiguous

[22:25:02] <Decker> it's not for points on the sides
[22:25:48] <Guest11> If you have a cylinder and rotate it about it's long axis, the points collected would be the same regardless of rotation
[22:26:23] <Decker> ?
[22:27:25] <Decker> it's not 3 cylinders though... it's 1 cylinder in the end that's the sum of the 3 components
[22:27:39] <Guest11> i have no idea what you're saying
[22:27:57] <Guest11> i am collecting points on the surface of an ellipsoid (or a cylinder)
[22:28:14] <Guest11> rotating the ellipsoid/cylinder along its long axis will not change the points collected
[22:28:23] <Guest11> and therefore I have no idea how to determine the rotation on its long axis

[22:32:33] <buster> are we assuming two of the axes of this ellipsoid are the same (it's a spheroid)?
[22:34:04] <buster> in any case, i think you should work on getting the transformation that takes the unit sphere to the given ellipsoid, then do singular value decomposition on that transformation
