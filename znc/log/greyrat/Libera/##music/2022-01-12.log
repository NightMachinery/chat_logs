[05:42:43] <SteppenwolfVM> i'd start with FreeRangeDillo, but for some strange reason other ops will remove the ban on him again despite FreeRangeDillo being one of those trump loving "respect muh freedump" guys 
[05:43:19] <SteppenwolfVM> by antisocial i mean facist, anti-feminist etc. 
[05:43:21] <louipc> dillo is a very reasonable person imo
[05:43:46] <SteppenwolfVM> a very smeary person being all about letting poor people die for his "freedom"

[08:18:34] <SummerSkies> I've recently acquired an extremely useful skill in music composition where you can switch scales completely through the progression of the chords by taking advantage of what notes the current chord has in common with that chord in a completely different musical context
[08:19:01] <Panther> With diminished 7ths?
[08:19:26] <SummerSkies> you can do it with those but they aren't particularly linked to what I'm saying
[08:19:36] <SummerSkies> Panther: I have an example I can post

[08:20:16] * Panther is still cranking the last tune.
[08:20:35] <SummerSkies> despite the fact that this doesn't have any type of stylistic arrangement, you'll find that the scale I began in is completely abandoned through seamlessly going from one scale to another
[08:20:38] <MusicalDillo> check it out about 9:00
[08:22:07] <efex_> SummerSkies: yeah, a diminished chorfd can be seen as part of 4 scales
[08:22:22] <SummerSkies> efex_: ah I see
[08:22:36] <efex_> someone called it “the royal road to modulation” but I forget who
[08:22:45] <SummerSkies> I've actually never been big on diminished chords
[08:23:29] <SummerSkies> even though the transitions I know how to do work, it's still hard to have them not sound sudden or random
[08:23:31] <Panther> How about augmented chords?
[08:23:39] <SummerSkies> nah not really those either
[08:23:39] <efex_> oh sorry ypu were talking of another techniquw: common chord modulation etc
[08:23:43] <efex_> d)h
[08:23:50] <SummerSkies> but I'm a simple musician when it comes to chord diversity
[08:25:09] <efex_> I am a weird mashup

[18:40:39] <Panther> hmmm
[18:41:08] <Panther> If this is gonna be a pain in the ass to be in here, then I am gonna go.
[18:41:35] <macrobat> less trolls less pain
[18:41:40] <Panther> Blah
[18:41:40] <louipc> looks like that guy was previously banned anyway probly for good reason
[18:42:11] <Panther> Trolls are trolls... they are just ppl looking for attention in an often less then social way.
[18:42:24] <Panther> Partly because some don't know any better. Sadly.
[18:42:47] <louipc> looks like a smart guy tho. cantelope.org has some interesting stuff
[18:42:49] <macrobat> they eat attention that could be directed towards more rewarding areas
[18:43:28] <Panther> So does worrying about them, dealing with them, and even talking about them.
[18:43:32] <louipc> very sad to lose technical intelligence to complete social incompetence
[18:43:56] <louipc> anyways offtopic. let the music continue
[18:44:02] <Panther> No one is completely socially incompetent.
[18:44:06] <Panther> Screw that.
[18:44:45] <louipc> you sure?
[18:45:16] <Panther> Yep, no one ever dictated in here what was 'on-topic' despite it being called ##music.
[18:45:33] <louipc> lool seems like half the ppl in here are sockpuppets or somethin
[18:45:47] <louipc> the /topic dictates it imo

[18:47:43] <Panther> I am already in 39 channels on 4 networks.
[18:48:07] <louipc> you got a lotta interests ;)
[18:51:19] <macrobat> the trolling is a bad thing. making the chan always completely ontopic may not be the optimal response
[18:51:49] <Panther> Some are very specific, so it wound't do much good to chat about them in other channels... physics, chemistry, statistics, etc... tho, they do get talked about in other channels, it's not at the same level... kinda like #music-theory, too.

[18:55:46] <louipc> yea those other music chans are too specific
[18:56:04] <louipc> Panther: are u in there?
[18:56:11] <Panther> Well, for me, I came here with the ppl in this channel from freenode, because this is where my friends came, and where we had fun. Fun, to me is relatively light and pleasant, and not full of rules and regulations. Most of the time, like I said yesterday, that is the case.. 90%+ I estimate. I guess I just don't feel the need to control things as much, cuz relatively little bothers me.
[18:56:14] <Panther> In where?
[18:56:21] <louipc> #music-theory, etc
[18:56:40] <Panther> Try /whois Panther
[18:57:17] <Panther> It should show all the channels now that aren't themselves set +s or +p
[18:57:44] <macrobat> trolls make it unpleasant. for a couple of years in freenode music, the game wasn't worth the candle
[18:57:46] <louipc> you could just say yes/no. anyway. no one should be told to stop talking about theory here
[18:58:31] <louipc> if you don't like rules then just make em up as you go i guess ;p
[18:58:34] <Panther> I just wanted to see if setting umode -i would let you see the other shannels.
[18:58:50] <Panther> Usually when ppl join this net, it sets them to +i automatically.
[18:59:08] <Panther> And you can only see the channels they are in with you.
[18:59:11] <louipc> oh yea i seen a bunch there. any chat in #music-theory at all?
[18:59:24] <Panther> Sure
[18:59:46] <louipc> cool
[19:00:14] <Panther> I post links from SMT from time to time.. when there are interesting articles... Society for Music Theory, or academia.edu.
[19:00:16] <louipc> im mainly here for ppl posting music. but i'm game for all aspects of music chat
[19:00:29] <louipc> evrything else can go elsewhere imo

[19:04:29] <Panther> We have had trolls in here 1000 times worse than anyone recently. Recently, imho, it has been a lot more about personal issues than general troll behavior.
[19:06:08] <louipc> lol i never really witnessed more obvious sockpuppets before yesterday tho

[20:28:49] <artao> I can't get my Neutron to properly connect to my computer so I can update the firmware on it
[20:28:53] <artao> >:(
[20:29:11] <Panther> Maybe you need a better neutron source.
[20:29:12] <artao> Behringer requires you to install some shitty 3rd party USB driver, and for some reason it doesn't seem to install right
[20:29:32] <artao> i might have to temp disable a whole bunch of other USB drivers, or try to do it in safe mode
[20:29:33] <artao> OH!
[20:29:47] <artao> and, after trying to update, it now ALSO won't connect to my DAWs
[20:29:49] <artao> >:(
[20:29:54] <Panther> Some accelerator-based neutron generators induce fusion between beams of deuterium and/or tritium ions and metal hydride targets which also contain these isotopes.
[20:29:58] <Panther> There ya go :)
[20:30:08] <artao> why can't they just use regular normal fucking USB drivers? wtaf
[20:30:10] <artao> fuck them
[20:30:24] <artao> yeah, but i'd need lots of tritium for that

[20:33:19] <Panther> The stable form of cobalt is produced in supernovae through the r-process.
[20:33:32] <Panther> As opposed to the s-process :)
[20:33:36] <artao> cobalt-60 is radioactive, not "regular" cobalt
[20:33:42] <artao> perhaps i was thinking of cesium
[20:33:46] <artao> probably
[20:34:05] <Panther> The r-process usually synthesizes the most neutron-rich stable isotopes of each heavy element.
[20:34:13] <Panther> I used to use a caesium ion gun.
[20:34:35] <Panther> For fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.

[23:36:07] <morlog> covid is here to stay, its sars episode 2

[23:37:21] <morlog> excess humans everywhere
[23:37:29] <murthy> but in case of economic activity, its very nice
[23:37:34] <morlog> so many empty minds just wondering around
[23:37:38] <artao> we've never had any success getting rid of coronaviruses. they evolve too rapidly
[23:37:56] <artao> there will likely be a yearly vaccine, like for the flu
[23:38:07] <artao> perhaps bi-annually
[23:38:09] <murthy> morlog: But I saw in the news that people are quitting jobs in the US
[23:38:24] <murthy> even thought there was significant demand for jobs
[23:38:26] <murthy> strange
[23:38:46] <artao> murthy yeah. they want reasonable pay
[23:38:48] <morlog> people are quitting jobs because the employers arent paying them enough to survive
[23:38:53] <artao> and employers won't do it
[23:38:53] <murthy> I wish I had empty minds to wander around
[23:39:01] <murthy> morlog: ya
[23:39:12] <artao> but employees who ARE paying decently don't have any employment problems
[23:39:27] <morlog> $725 an hour when you need to make at least $20 an hour to live with any kind of comfort
[23:39:36] <morlog> $7.25
[23:39:42] <murthy> artao: are you drunk?
[23:39:42] <morlog> not 725
[23:39:47] <artao> LOLno
[23:39:55] <artao> i resisted both cigs and alcohol
[23:39:58] <louipc> i need 100$ per hour for comfort
[23:39:59] <murthy> artao: why are you tying wrongly then
[23:40:07] <artao> \o/
[23:40:16] <artao> $15/hr is cost-of-living
[23:40:23] <murthy> artao: "but employees who ARE paying decently"
[23:40:24] <louipc> 100
[23:40:26] <morlog> $100 an hour is my minimum
[23:40:34] <artao> oh. simple typo

[23:47:47] <murthy> morlog: oh that would be the power bank fault
[23:47:51] <murthy> thats really odd
[23:48:07] <murthy> cause for a lithium that would only happen when they are very old
[23:48:31] <morlog> its a LiFePO4 battery
[23:48:31] <murthy> morlog: wait that was your debit card?
[23:48:43] <nativetexan> phone
[23:48:54] <murthy> ok
[23:48:57] <morlog> murthy: not mine, someone elses
[23:49:05] <murthy> morlog: oh ok

[23:50:03] <murthy> yuck
[23:50:10] <morlog>  yeah
[23:50:35] <murthy> we have multiple protections for debit cards here
[23:50:46] <murthy> also we are moving to digital transactions
[23:51:03] <murthy> my guess its no more debit cards in 3 years
[23:51:11] <LibertyDillo> morlog> its a LiFePO4 battery << What could they have done to screw it up?
[23:51:15] <murthy> already VISA and Mastercard are crying
[23:51:18] <morlog> person should get there money back after an investigation
[23:51:28] <morlog> someone here may be going to jail
[23:51:42] <LibertyDillo> yeah, hope they reported it immediately
[23:51:42] <murthy> LibertyDillo: my guess is manufacturing defect
[23:51:53] <LibertyDillo> Well, hey it's under warranty
[23:52:04] <murthy> morlog: ya
[23:52:10] <morlog> LibertyDillo: im thinking circuit fault and maybe not the battery
[23:52:20] <murthy> ah charge controller
[23:52:27] <morlog> it has mqtt which is a pretty shaky protocol
[23:52:55] <morlog> im testing it out now while the generator is on
[23:53:23] <morlog> it just dropped down to no bars

[23:53:46] <morlog> if it doesnt shut off in the next hour then the display is just not reading right
[23:54:32] <murthy> morlog: the generator's output is pure sinewave?
[23:54:35] <morlog> i charged it up all the way yesterday so it should of only had 1 bar gone with how much i used it
[23:54:56] <morlog> everyone elses stuff would be fried if it wasnt
[23:55:01] <LibertyDillo> Might email Swarey and see if they have any ideas
[23:55:17] <morlog> there is a 2 year warranty on it
[23:55:21] <LibertyDillo> yeah
[23:55:32] <murthy> morlog: where did you buy it from?
