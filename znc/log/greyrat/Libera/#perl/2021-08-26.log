[06:33:58] <thowe> :) my new PC parts are here. (well, all but the CPU).  First time in my life I will own current gen hardware. :)
[06:34:58] <Adura> Picking up a Ryzen 9 5950X?
[06:35:44] <thowe> Ryzen 4650G actually
[06:36:22] <Adura> Huh, that's usually an OEM-only part.
[06:36:38] <mst> thowe: there is only one time in my life I owned current gen hardware, and it was a first gen athlon ;)
[06:36:39] <thowe> Yeah.  Had to order it from Korea.
[06:36:57] <mst> a whole 850Mhz and 768Mb of RAM
[06:37:01] <mst> it was gloriouS
[06:37:08] <mst> I think I finally killed it after about ten years
[06:37:10] <Adura> Hope you didn't pay much more than a 5600G.
[06:37:35] <thowe> Adura, me too...
[06:37:52] <Adura> I still run Athlons, though slightly newer than that one.
[06:38:00] <thowe> was like $300 with shipping I think
[06:39:23] <mst> it was built in early 2001, originally to run Windows and NetBSD dual boot, and finished its life getting the shit kicked out of it as my home workstation for shadowcat stuff running Slackware around 2009 or so
[06:39:42] <mst> I kept the original rc.conf for the NetBSD install though: http://trout.me.uk/rc.conf
[06:39:52] <Grinnz> i'm really glad i don't have to source any computer parts in the forseeable future
[06:40:05] <thowe> Oh, slackware...  I still remember when my Slackware 3.2 CDs arrived from Walnut Creek CDROM
[06:40:21] <Grinnz> it is Not A Good Time for that
[06:40:35] <Adura> CPU prices are doing better recently.
[06:40:43] <thowe> Grinnz, I agree, but I was tired of waiting.
[06:41:09] <thowe> Been sitting on some PC money for almost 2 years and finally said "let's do this"
[06:41:38] <Grinnz> gotta do what you gotta do
[06:43:09] <thowe> but the built-in graphics was where I sort of skimped.  Can always get fancy video later if ever I need it.  Even my old machine can pull off Minecraft, so I think I will be OK for the once  month I decide to punch a tree.

[19:23:58] <gchristensen> oh sure! I have a program hydra-notify that executes Tasks, and I'd like the Tasks module to be tracking some prometheus metrics. My thinking is to `use Hydra::Tasks ($prometheus); as a way to inject the prometheus client. I think I'm worried, though, that this is just generally an ugly idea, but also that import() will be called for every `.pm` I `use` it in, making the actual value of `our
[19:24:00] <gchristensen> $prometheus` less clear. (is that the right context?)

[21:46:42] <Grinnz> if they want to learn how it works thats fine but most people are better off just cpanming a thing into a thing
[21:47:04] <leitz> As a relative newcomer, installing to /usr/local/whatever is much better than local::lib or multiple Perl versions in my home directory.
[21:47:37] <Grinnz> so you're running cpan as root?
[21:48:15] <leitz> Grinnz, nope. I use a group and make the directory tree group writeable.
[21:48:38] <Grinnz> alright at this point i'm gonna need to see your perl -V
[21:49:31] <genio> I'd prefer that we got more on board with the likes of JavaScript in this area. Just install everything to the local directory all the time. Let them have different modules for different apps straight off the bat. Not that it's great, it's just a MUCH easier barrier to entry for devs. Make installing globally something you have to work for rather than for the app
[21:50:30] <leitz> cpanm -iv XML::LibXML failed as well.  Besides the log, and perl -V, what do you need?
[21:50:58] <santi> i sitll don't understand how to get a working module as a non-root via cpan...
[21:51:11] <genio> "Use a cpanfile"  "ok, how do I just install what's in my cpanfile?" "you can use carton or cpanm/etc"  "ok, how do I install carton?" and so on and so forth
[21:51:22] <Altreus> santi: you don't, you do it via cpanm
[21:51:34] <Altreus> and you get cpanm via perlbrew, which you're using because your system perl is already out of date
[21:51:45] <Grinnz> leitz: your CPAN config since you're using that
[21:52:04] <xenu> i have a new idea. @INC should contain this by default: ~/lib/perl5/lib/<$ENV{PERL_ENV} // perl5>
[21:52:18] <xenu> maybe with a version and arch too
[21:52:27] *** Joins: rcr (~rcr@rirc/rcr)
[21:53:04] <xenu> so basically thanks to the env variable you can have multiple environments
[21:53:23] <xenu> of course you can already do that with PERL5LIB but the difference is that there's a default env
[21:53:25] <Altreus> only for system perl, not for perlbrew perls
[21:53:57] <Altreus> The problem is actually cpan/cpanm; it's easy to tell Perl where you've got your local libs, but it's harder to tell the tools to install things there
[21:54:05] <Altreus> "harder"
[21:54:09] <Altreus> local::lib does like 3 things
[21:54:16] <haarg> how about having local::lib install into a version-specific subdirectory
[21:54:29] <Grinnz> it's pretty easy to tell cpanm to do it
[21:54:30] <xenu> they actually install to ~/perl5 by default but then perl can't use it because it isn't in @INC
[21:54:33] <haarg> but use the same PERL5LIB it currently does
[21:55:33] <Altreus> I was trying to figure out what local::lib does but I realised that perlbrew's bashrc just does everything for you

[22:10:15] <Grinnz> (assuming you have write access to them of course)
[22:10:31] <Grinnz> no, because it's not a beginner thing to do generally, but works fine when not using system perl
[22:10:33] <Altreus> krismatrix: maybe on irc.perl.org, but dunno
[22:10:58] <Altreus> beginners should start with perlbrew, ironically the easiest thing to set up in the whole ecosystem IMO
[22:11:01] <Grinnz> the setup for a non-system-perl is "install somewhere you have write access to, then just use it"
[22:11:14] <Grinnz> with a corollary of "make sure there's no local::lib in your env"
[22:11:18] <krismatrix> what is perlbrew? something like npm?
[22:11:52] <leitz> Grinnz, ah, gotcha. So the issue is that I'm not using a compiled-by-me Perl, but mixing OS perl and cpan(m)?
[22:12:04] <Grinnz> krismatrix: more like pyenv/rbenv (there is also a plenv which maps more closely to those)

[22:12:28] <Grinnz> leitz: no, it's mixing compiled-by-you perl with local::lib

[22:15:32] <Altreus> you're confused

[22:16:06] <krismatrix> don't know if any of those can do the opposite.
[22:16:12] <Grinnz> leitz: local::lib would be fine to use with this if you pointed it somewhere outside of the installation directory of that perl. the issue is that you pointed it at the same place it already installs modules and local::lib doesn't expect to be used that way
[22:16:27] <thrig> I use cpanm to install locally, never to trash the vendor space with

[22:24:21] <Grinnz> well ostensibly, some directory has to be used, so it might as well be the ones designed to be used

[22:26:16] <Grinnz> because we only have one @INC ordering

[22:31:29] <Grinnz> and on perl 5.10, dual life modules use them
[22:31:34] <Grinnz> because perl 5.10's @INC order is messed up

[22:32:17] <Grinnz> but normally yes, all cpan installs go in site_perl
[22:32:52] <Altreus> well TIL
[22:33:10] <Altreus> interestingly, this has been the wrong thing to do since I started using Perl, so I've never actually done it
[22:33:23] <Grinnz> if it's a system perl, yeah
[22:33:38] <Grinnz> if you're not fighting with a package manager, installing to site_perl is generally fine
[22:34:03] <Grinnz> unfortunately newbies are always using system perl :P
[22:34:20] <Altreus> is there a site_perl associated with non-system perls?
[22:34:24] <Grinnz> yes
[22:34:24] <mason> system.perl.4eva
[22:34:45] <mason> and local::lib
[22:34:46] <Altreus> /home/adouglas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.30.0/lib/site_perl/5.30.0
[22:34:48] <Altreus> oh yeah
[22:34:50] <Grinnz> in perlbrew and plenv perls, cpan modules will get installed to their sitelib
[22:35:01] <Altreus> when I was talking about site_perl I was conflating it with system perl
[22:35:07] <Altreus> cos well
[22:35:14] <Altreus> perlbrews are sort of containerised in my head
[22:35:20] <Altreus> doesn't count
