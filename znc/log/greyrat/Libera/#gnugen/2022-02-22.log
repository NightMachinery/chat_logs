[01:10:45] <artectrex[m]> I think it took more than an hour for me, where it seemed to be compiling stuff for most of it? I just followed the installation guide of the manual
[01:42:11] <afontain[m]> haha
[01:42:15] <afontain[m]> I know that one
[01:42:34] <afontain[m]> make sure to use the stable channel, it should help
[02:11:25] <artectrex[m]> I'm on nixos https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-21.11 already
[02:14:50] <afontain[m]> ok
[02:15:06] <afontain[m]> the stable channel will only make these less common
[02:15:45] <afontain[m]> it can only happen after a `nix-channel --update` though
[02:15:57] <afontain[m]> (unless you are using flakes)
[02:16:46] <afontain[m]> basically it happens when a new update has been pushed to git, but cache.nixos.org hasn't got it yet
[02:26:50] <artectrex[m]> <afontain[m]> "basically it happens when a..." <- okay that's about what I figured happened
[05:25:34] <artectrex[m]> Hmm how do I open a port in the nixos firewall in a nix-y way to listen only on a wireguard interface? With docker I used `-p 10.200.200.1:1234:1234` and it would only listen on the 10.200.200.1 IP so it wouldn't be exposed to anything except wireguard peers
[09:27:23] <afontain[m]> networking.firewall.interfaces.<name>.allowed{TCP,UDP}Ports with where name=wg0?
[10:50:17] <artectrex[m]> Hmm
[10:50:34] <artectrex[m]> Then I also have to configure the service to listen there of course
[10:50:36] <artectrex[m]> Olau
[10:50:40] <artectrex[m]> * Okay
[12:33:23] <artectrex[m]> Fuck I'm becoming one of those nix people, next thing you know I'll be asking people "have you accepted our lord and saviour nix into your hearts"
[12:36:01] <artectrex[m]> Anyway why did we ever put up with non-declarative system administration? I'm not sure nix(OS) is the way I want it to be done but just having the whole system in some config files is so glorious 
[12:45:35] <typedef[m]> <artectrex[m]> "Fuck I'm becoming one of those..." <- Is that bad?
[12:52:29] <artectrex[m]> <typedef[m]> "Is that bad?" <- haha I guess not :P
[12:53:11] <afontain[m]> <artectrex[m]> "Anyway why did we ever put up..." <- I know right?
[12:53:35] <typedef[m]> Stop making me want to try that too
[12:55:54] <afontain[m]> I mean, I understand, there problem is that it's quite hard going back afterwards
