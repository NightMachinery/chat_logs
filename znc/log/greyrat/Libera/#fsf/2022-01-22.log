[00:58:55] <jacobk> Oh but I guess GitHub's license allows people to contribute regardless
[00:59:09] <jacobk> er, GitHub's ToS I mean
[00:59:18] <irelativism> is like a devious backpocket weapon they have with everyone involved in mozilla projects
[00:59:49] <irelativism> "Github ToS" dont know about that Im sorry
[00:59:55] <jacobk> I thought that you couldn't do selective targetting with trademarks.
[01:00:10] <irelativism> but jacobk I will give you an example
[01:00:25] <jacobk> irelativism: GitHub's terms of service says something about giving other GitHub users permission to fork and modify the code on GitHub.
[01:00:26] <irelativism> the debian dispute about FirefoxESR and Iceweasel
[01:00:39] <irelativism> was exactly because of the same issue
[01:01:00] <irelativism> Firefox was also abranged by the mozilla media-guide like rust
[01:01:12] <jacobk> Yes, I think, if what Debian distributes it not actually Firefox, then it makese sense to call it something else, no?
[01:01:23] <irelativism> and mozilla actually enforced the trademark policy there
[01:02:03] <irelativism> hmm that is interesting ": GitHub's terms of service says something about giving other GitHub users permission to fork and modify the code on GitHub." I didnt knew about that
[01:02:39] <irelativism> in what way was debian distributing something diferent?
[01:02:43] <jacobk> I'm no lawyer, but I think it would be reasonable to say trademarks don't apply when you're sending patches to the project that holds the trademarks (theoretically, if you just send diffs, maybe you don't even need to call it Rust).
[01:03:01] <irelativism> by the way debian was one of the biggest contribuors of firefox at that time
[01:03:03] <jacobk> irelativism: IIRC Debian had some patches to increase privacy or something
[01:03:29] <irelativism> sure that was outside the problem
[01:03:49] <irelativism> the way mozilla got debian to my understandment was because of the contributions not
[01:03:57] <irelativism> debian maintained modifications
[01:04:24] <irelativism> Im allways open to be correct on my understandment of something though
[01:04:46] <irelativism> but that is how I understood the trademark after reading it thourghout
[01:04:51] <jacobk> It seems ridiculous to have to send a trademark complaint for contributions, but I don't really know the details of the history
[01:05:54] <irelativism> the trademarketed word or brand was used throughout and so they were ask to decise
[01:06:10] <irelativism> that meaning drop all repositories related to firefox
[01:06:27] <irelativism> that is insane given it renders the license pointless
[01:06:48] <irelativism> so GPL is no longer efective when a trademark policy is abusive
[01:06:58] <irelativism> that is my understandment about it
[01:07:13] <irelativism> happy to hear diferent based prespectives on it
[01:07:34] <irelativism> and Im happy to read new information about it, even if laborious to read
[01:07:36] <irelativism> Cheer
[01:07:41] <irelativism> *Cheers
[01:07:57] <kompowiec> in which sense tradermark should be protected by GPL?
[01:08:05] <kompowiec> trademark*
[01:08:29] <jacobk> GPL'd software with a strong trademark could always be rebranded
[01:08:32] <irelativism> here is relevant bit of media-guide
[01:08:50] <irelativism> jacobk: sure that is allways the option
[01:08:58] <irelativism> but that is easier said then done
[01:09:11] <irelativism> I felt the pain with my RST fork of rust
[01:09:41] <jacobk> I've never rebranded something before, but it doesn't seem like it could be that hard.
[01:09:45] <irelativism> also Im not advocating for no trademark given trademarks are important to protect against copycat and malicious proxies
[01:09:54] <jacobk> ^

[01:10:07] *** Joins: alMalsamo (~alMalsamo@gateway/tor-sasl/almalsamo)
[01:10:14] <irelativism> Perl for example is a great balance to my view
[01:10:22] <irelativism> Python is not to bad as well
[01:10:45] <irelativism> jacobk: it is because the are much more references that you think
[01:11:16] <irelativism> you need to maintain a plenora of scripts to allways be striping trademarked bits of repositories
[01:11:38] <irelativism> the hard part is to identify what is considered part of the trademark or not
[01:11:56] <irelativism> it is possible but it is labourious, and many times needs human hand for it
[01:12:03] <jacobk> Well, I guess a rebranding would mean removing everything, but for just avoiding trademark issues you don't have to remove every single reference I think
[01:12:10] <irelativism> doing some of this things manually is painfull

[01:13:12] <irelativism> even things you might not think are trademarketed like comments etc
[01:13:27] <irelativism> anyway here is the relevant bit on the media-guide
[01:13:30] <jacobk> The media guide has restrictions on "Distributing a modified version of the Rust programming language or the Cargo package manager and "*"calling it Rust or Cargo"*.
[01:13:30] <irelativism> "Well, I guess a rebranding would mean removing everything, but for just avoiding trademark issues you don't have to remove every single reference I think"

[01:16:05] <irelativism> "Don't call it Rust or Cargo?" that obviously doesnt seam practical
[01:16:31] <irelativism> everytime you go do a commit you need to strip code of all trademark references
[01:17:01] <irelativism> then rust team would need to reaply such scripts to reintroduce such trademarketed references
[01:17:13] <irelativism> dont think anyone is ever gonna do that
[01:17:24] <jacobk> Has the Rust Foundation said anything about code comments? Mayeb RST was just overreacting? I'm inclined to think that you would only need to change the readme and the name of the package, but I'm not a lawyer.
[01:17:40] <jacobk> Well, and maybe other "overview" information
[01:18:05] <irelativism> people just clone the code and doe a merge request for it or push patches without ever thinking about the legal consequences that might have on their future

[01:20:05] <irelativism> Rust foundation doesnt have a say here unfortunately I have contated them
[01:20:23] <irelativism> given they are still using mozilla media-guide trademark policy
[01:20:34] <irelativism> the reason Im bringing up this now
[01:21:29] <irelativism> is because the foundation setup work is close to be ended so it is he right timing to ask the foundation to take control of its trademarks
[01:22:18] <irelativism> it is hard though given many people in Rust are still very atached to mozilla and dont understand the issue with this agressive trademark policies
[01:23:11] <irelativism> "contributing massively over-complicated." obviously everyone ignores this but according to trdemark in theory is what people are supposed to do
[01:23:30] <jacobk> This might be interesting (Rust is US right?): https://www.uspto.gov/page/about-trademark-infringement
[01:23:49] <irelativism> people just infringe on trademark without even knowing
[01:24:03] <jacobk> Trademark infringement requires that the useage is "likely to cause confusion in the minds of consumers about the source or sponsorship of the goods or services offered"

[01:25:20] <irelativism> "manner that is likely to cause confusion, deception, or mistake about the source of the goods and/or services." this seams highly generalistic, from experience this would be nonstanding in court

[01:27:06] <irelativism> is very easy to argue specially in a court of law for a fork that makes some small improvements or someone contributing back a rejected merge request as either "confusion", "mistake", "deception"
[01:29:21] <jacobk> GitHub shows when a project is a fork and links back to the original, in cases where the fork was made on GitHub. And anything uploaded directly the rust's GitHub is obviously development work.
[01:29:21] <jacobk> You might be right that Rust could have a legitimate complaint, which is why it would be good to get clarification, but I think infringement is unlikely
[01:29:30] <jacobk> Maybe someone should ask a lawyer hehe
[01:30:17] <irelativism> I would agree that a acepted merge request maybe makes the infrigment nonstanding thanks for presenting this refutation, it is based and makes some sense. Cheers

[01:56:23] <irelativism> there you are abranged by trademark law
[01:56:29] <irelativism> not contractual law
[01:56:51] <jacobk> I think Rust's contracts have to supercede trademark law otherwise a trademark policy doesn't make any sense.
[01:56:55] <irelativism> the only way that contractual law can break trademark law on this case is with alicense
[01:57:05] <irelativism> sure oral licenses are a thing
[01:57:22] <jacobk> They could write the clarification into the license
[01:57:27] <irelativism> but ussually nonstanding on court according to precedents
[01:58:19] <jacobk> Also, regarding "other uses" in Perl, I think it matters what is not part of "other uses". It says above the other uses section that "Licensed redistributors of Perl code are permitted by their licenses to use the Perl logo in connection with their distribution services, on product packaging, and in promotional materials. Contact trademark@perlfoundation.org for more information on becoming a licensed Perl redistributor.", which seems to
[01:58:19] <jacobk>  suggest you need permission to redistribute Perl and call it Perl.

[03:39:27] <DiffieHellman> The reason you don't want to login, or better yet not have an account is because those services you use and logging in makes you a used.

[10:41:51] <Andrew> <Linus Torvalds> Linux is not developed by the FSF, and will never be free software

[10:47:53] <DiffieHellman> Probably. He is correct that Linux is not devloped by the FSF. Linux is free software no matter what he says as long as its GPLv2 licensed.
[10:48:23] *** Joins: edun (~qbt@user/edun)
[10:49:03] <Andrew> He says it's open source, not free software
[10:49:06] <Andrew> *shrug*
[10:49:40] <Andrew> Also, I'm not sure if I want to put AGPL v3 *or later* on my software, I mean, how could I trust the FSF in the future?
[10:49:43] <DiffieHellman> Yes, he can say what he likes, even though he's wrong.
[10:50:32] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: The FSF currently has rms on the board, so it's good for now. The license is written in a way meaning you can reject invalid changes that don't improve the freedom.
[10:51:07] <DiffieHellman> Still, if you want to upgrade in the future, allocate someone who is able to decide the licensing in the future.
[10:51:19] <Andrew> Yup
[10:53:07] <tpefreedom> The default kernel has proprietary blobs though.
[10:53:36] <Andrew> Definitely doesn't sound like a GPL violation by the very people who licensed it.
[10:54:10] <DiffieHellman> Most of them seem to be in linux-firmware, a lot of drivers rely on proprietary firmware though.
[10:54:38] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Please link me a source file with a proprietary firmware in it :)
[10:55:08] <Andrew> A source file won't have it, yeah, it's in linux-firmware it seems
[10:55:23] <Andrew> Ah that's why I failed emerging linux-firmware
[10:55:43] <Andrew> ... And I'm probably missing out on some free firmware too.
[10:55:48] <DiffieHellman> So Linux doesn't have any proprietary firmware in it anymore? Hmm, lemme check debians patchset

[10:56:52] <DiffieHellman> There's a package of only free firmware available on debian, but usually that's more annoyying just to include than useful - the shipped firmware usually works fine
[10:57:05] <Andrew> Yup
[10:57:16] <Andrew> Even my WiFi works fine just with the kernel, surprising.

[13:59:01] <Andrew> Doesn't seem so to me.
[13:59:19] <kompowiec> I, in order to avoid it, often before I even get to know the topic at all, I go straight to the critique of a given statement.
[14:00:23] <kompowiec> troll meaning it seems to have changed a little over the years. Back then it was just a guy who likes to piss people off. Today it could be anyone who does not agree with our views.
[14:00:38] <DiffieHellman> Yup, that seems so.
[14:00:50] <kompowiec> it's sad
[14:00:59] <DiffieHellman> With actual spammers, you /ignore and move on.
[14:01:10] <kompowiec> nothing irritates me more than intellectual or conscious ignorance.
[14:01:17] <DiffieHellman> Same
[14:01:52] <Andrew> The slight problem with /ignore is that the conversation gets out of context, minor issue though
[14:02:12] <kompowiec> well, ignorance may not be overcome, but if someone likes to troll, it can be humiliated.

[14:05:47] <labrador> etc
[14:05:56] <Andrew> Images: Most formats are free
[14:06:04] <Andrew> Videos: Oh my, use webm or ogv.
[14:06:07] <labrador> well yes jpegs and pngs are free
[14:06:09] <kompowiec> labrador, you know, it seems to me to be a more efficient solution than the ones from Tor
[14:06:22] <labrador> Andrew, for video there are two things
[14:06:25] <labrador> containers
[14:06:27] <labrador> codecs
[14:06:27] <Andrew> jpeg, png, gif, xcf, svg, ps/eps/pdf are all free
[14:06:34] <DiffieHellman> Most formats are free, but almost all new formats seems to be covered by patents.
[14:06:36] <Andrew> I'm talking about containers for those
[14:06:45] <labrador> TIFF is nice
[14:06:49] <Andrew> Codecs? VP8 and theora, or just don't encode it
[14:06:49] <labrador> AVIF
[14:06:51] <Andrew> Yes, TIFF
[14:06:55] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: pdf is covered by patents - Adobe's
[14:06:59] <Andrew> Never heard of AVIF.  
[14:07:03] <Andrew> Wait, what?
[14:07:10] <labrador> Software patents
[14:07:14] <labrador> They are bullshit
[14:07:15] <DiffieHellman> Adobe only gives a patent grant for those who meet the pdf spec.
[14:07:16] <Andrew> The standard seems to be free.
[14:07:28] <labrador> has patents tho
[14:07:40] <DiffieHellman> If your implementation is the slightest bit wrong, and Adobe cares too, they can take away the patent grant
[14:07:42] <kompowiec> pdf seems like interoperable but not neccesary freee
[14:08:06] <labrador> For codecs I think AV1 is best
[14:08:12] <Andrew> Is it okay to, for example, release free software with patents, and say: If you're making free software for similar goals, sure!  Making proprietary software for this goal? Nope 
[14:08:13] <labrador> Its free and probably not patented
[14:08:16] <DiffieHellman> .webm is a packaging format which is pretty much a limited form of .mkv
[14:08:26] <labrador> And is the best at compression
[14:08:33] <labrador> mkv is the best
[14:08:36] <DiffieHellman> labrador: AV1 takes forever to encode, and it's covered by too many patents.
[14:08:43] <labrador> DiffieHellman, has no patents
[14:08:48] <labrador> But its slow yes
[14:08:52] <Andrew> When I see a .mkv, I'm not sure if I can open it
[14:08:54] <kompowiec> hmm, wikipedia says that it's open format but without source, except https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html
[14:09:02] <Andrew> When I see a .webm, it's usually openable
[14:09:09] <labrador> Andrew, hmm yeah. There's too much that can go into an mkv
[14:09:13] <Andrew> RARs are nonfree :\
[14:09:15] <labrador> Like anything
[14:09:22] <labrador> Andrew, zips are not tho
[14:09:26] <labrador> So thats fine
[14:09:28] <Andrew> And my teacher sends me ton of RARs each week.
[14:09:31] <labrador> lmao
[14:09:40] <Andrew> And I made them switch to tar.xz
[14:09:46] <labrador> Why not just tell them to use zips
[14:09:51] <labrador> Its easier on them too
[14:10:03] <Andrew> Because I want Windows users to be ashame of their OS (lol)
[14:10:24] <Andrew> Also, xz has a better compression ratio
[14:10:27] <kompowiec> >2022
[14:10:28] <labrador> Don't take an adversarial stance Andrew,that just makes your work harder
[14:10:28] <kompowiec> >rar
[14:10:30] <kompowiec> oh my
[14:10:38] <DiffieHellman> labrador: The base format, like VP9 has a patent pool, with permissions granted. Patent rent seekers have come along, and built patent pools separate to the developers to get sweet, sweet, royalties.
[14:10:45] <kompowiec> the only place on the internet which i saw still rar it was warez groups
[14:10:52] <labrador> oh DiffieHellman thats evil
[14:11:04] <labrador> kompowiec, warez groups use rar yes
[14:11:05] <DiffieHellman> These groups are seeking to rort hardware encoder developers etc
[14:11:07] <Andrew> Patents, stupid.
[14:11:13] <labrador> I am annoyed by those guys
[14:11:24] <Andrew> I'm still thinking to use patents for good, just like what we do with copyright.
[14:11:39] <labrador> Also annoyed by the trackers that only take cd rips from a proprietary windows ripper
[14:11:47] <labrador> Not even cueripper
[14:12:03] <Andrew> Maybe: Make creative peices of free software, patent it, then automatically grant them to free software developers 
[14:12:26] <Andrew> I have no idea how patents are actually registered

[14:17:53] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Not a prepubscent, so does that make any difference?
[14:18:13] <kompowiec> my first encounter with free software was around 8 or even 6 :)
[14:18:28] <DiffieHellman> The problem with patents is that you can get 1 or 20, but IBM has 30,000.

[14:19:22] <Andrew> lol that's normal...
[14:19:27] <Andrew> 30,000?!
[14:19:48] <DiffieHellman> I may have made that number up, lets see what it is
[14:20:23] <kompowiec> many statistics on country innovation are measured precisely with the help of patents :/
[14:21:16] <DiffieHellman> IBM apparrently has 9,130 individual patents, but they file these for every country pretty much
[14:21:40] <DiffieHellman> IBM loves to boast about how many patents they have: https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-01-14-IBM-Tops-U-S-Patent-List-for-2019

[14:24:57] <DiffieHellman> IBM gets so many patents as it lets you deal with patent trolls. Someone files that IBM is infringing on x patent, so IBM goes and gets out the 10 patents that the filer "infringes". IBM then says "lets cross license", and IBM gets the patent and the filer gets permission to "use" whatever.
[14:25:36] <DiffieHellman> IBM can't deal with entirely non practising entities though, as they do nothing but file patent lawsuits/

[14:26:37] <DiffieHellman> Meanwhile, studies have shown that patents only have negative affects, even in the physical manufacturing sector - you can't do anything without worrying about patents.
[14:26:41] <Whistler> yeah this may be why all of the big teches have tons of patents.  and if you read the patents many are very stupid
[14:27:12] <DiffieHellman> All software patents are invalid, as you can't patent math and software is math.
[14:27:24] <DiffieHellman> Of wait, the USA has made certain kinds of math patentable.
[14:28:33] <labrador> Yeh its like you wanna patent 2+2?
[14:29:01] <DiffieHellman> As long as you use enough complicated lanaguge and spin, you can get that patent.

[14:30:04] <DiffieHellman> Patents were originally intended to ensure that designs were released, so people wouldn't keep their designs to themselves. But now, the standard practice practice is to use lanuage that the even the inventor can't recognise
[14:30:32] <DiffieHellman> Patents were of some use in the past, not anymore - no-one bothers to read them anymore.

[14:30:45] <Whistler> totally agree.
[14:30:53] <labrador> Because
[14:30:56] <labrador> if you read them
[14:31:02] <labrador> And violate one of them
[14:31:07] <labrador> Then the fine is even more
[14:31:21] <Whistler> basically all of them are written by lawyers who don't even know what they are writing.
[14:31:27] <DiffieHellman> That as well, but mostly because you can't get anything useful from reading them.
[14:32:07] <labrador> Yeah its lawyer speak,tell an engineer to make something from them and he'll never be able to
[14:32:18] <DiffieHellman> Patents can still get you even if you don't know they exist, or someone filed it 3 years ago, but kept refining their submission every year so it doesn't get published.

[14:33:22] <DiffieHellman> Back to software patents, it's common for a patent to be issued multiple times. There were 2 patents, to 2 different compaines, awarded for LZW (used for gif).

[15:04:38] <DiffieHellman> MediaGoblin would probably be limited by network speed far before processing power or RAM is exhausted.

[15:10:50] <zleap> ok
[15:10:56] <kompowiec> well it's instagram replacement
[15:11:02] <zleap> yeah
[15:11:08] *** leonarth_ is now known as leonarth
[15:11:11] <zleap> peertube is a replacement for youtube
[15:11:58] <DiffieHellman> I won't log in just to view an image tbh, but pixelfed seems to be what hiya wants, as he wants comments.
[15:12:05] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[15:12:33] <DiffieHellman> Sadly peertube is built on JavaScript technology, which hinders its adoption.
[15:12:53] <zleap> if the peertune instances federates with mastodon properly you can comment from mastodon
[15:13:07] <kompowiec> especially wchch doesn't work with LibreJS
[15:13:15] <zleap> DiffieHellman, surely peertune is more privacy friendly than youtube
[15:13:30] <zleap> but i can see your points here
[15:13:35] <kompowiec> the only advantage MediaGoblin it's no javascript
[15:13:53] <DiffieHellman> zleap: Depends, you can download a video from youtube over Tor, without much JavaScript being run.
[15:14:15] <DiffieHellman> Peertube would be great if there was a native client (i.e. written in a sane lanaguage).
[15:14:19] <zleap> i think you can do that with peertube too
[15:14:21] <kompowiec> but not federated, what hurts, i don't want browse many video hosting sites

[15:16:12] <DiffieHellman> You can get videos from peertube via HTTP it seems, but you need to use activitypub and webtorrent to do bandwidth sharing.
[15:16:23] <labrador> Yeah peertube is cool
[15:16:43] <DiffieHellman> There's a C webtorrent implementation if I remember correctly, but not activitypub
[15:17:00] <kompowiec> i just dont understand one thing why peertube makes its own torrent like archive.org
[15:17:13] <zleap> i knw there is something similar to youtube-dl that works with peertube
[15:17:29] <zleap> too many to try and keep track of names though,
[15:17:31] <DiffieHellman> wget?
[15:17:36] <kompowiec> why not just add to seeding like other peer
[15:18:02] <zleap> not sure,  maybe ask the developers
[15:18:14] <zleap> are you on forums like fediverse.town?
[15:18:19] <kompowiec> creating a new torrent without the old swarm seems pointless to me.
[15:18:20] <DiffieHellman> youtube-dl seems to support peertube actually
[15:18:48] <zleap> yeah
[15:19:01] <zleap> i think youtube keeps blocking it though
[15:19:39] <DiffieHellman> You need to use yt-dlp if you want to download from youtube
[15:19:48] <zleap> ah ok

[15:20:39] <zleap> thing is most people are probably downloading for personal use, offline viewing not for copyright infringement
[15:21:00] <DiffieHellman> hiya: Mediagoblin is just for talk hosting and has no comments.
[15:21:34] <zleap> i like being able to drag and drop media,  make it a lot easier to upload multiple files
[15:21:34] <DiffieHellman> nginx is excellent for hosting images and webm's, but comments are a built-it-yourself thing
[15:21:39] <labrador> What does mediagoblin do?

[15:26:20] <labrador> no
[15:26:33] <labrador> its a personal cloud,why would it have comments
[15:26:53] <DiffieHellman> 0. Install nginx. 1. Write a script that rsync's the file to your server and puts the link in your clipbord
[15:26:57] <zleap> you can share the content, so if you shared to say mastodon,  then people could comment fromthere

[17:27:35] <irelativism> Andrew: you spoken about plan9 the other day
[17:27:43] <Andrew> Yes?
[17:27:44] <irelativism> I allways had some interest in it
[17:27:57] <irelativism> btw o/ Andrew 
[17:27:57] <Andrew> You can get it from 9p.io or 9front.org I believe
[17:28:02] <Andrew> Hello :D
[17:28:19] <irelativism> yes HArveyOS is also interesting
[17:28:42] <irelativism> but my question is do you know in what way it is a decentralized OS?
[17:28:52] <irelativism> I never really understood it
[17:29:16] <irelativism> https://harvey-os.org/
[17:29:40] <Andrew> Hmm, you can link plan 9 machines with 9cpu
[17:29:48] <Andrew> I've tried that years ago, forgot how to do that
[17:32:51] <Andrew> labrador: mbsync
[17:32:53] <irelativism> what is 9cpu
[17:33:13] <irelativism> Im asking this because I was imagining a cluster inside my machine
[17:33:24] <labrador> Andrew, ok
[17:33:35] <irelativism> where cpus work toghether but then when disconected they continue running
[17:33:40] <labrador> Andrew, what email client do you use?
[17:33:41] <Andrew> basically, at least on raspi clusters, you can have CPU servers that do the calculations, 9picpu, and a pi that does the interfacing stuff, 9pi.  Of course you can have disks on the 9picpu servers
[17:33:45] <irelativism> would plan9 work for that?
[17:33:48] <Andrew> labrador: neomutt or mu4e
[17:34:00] <Andrew> irelativism: If you disconnect them, you're in trouble.
[17:34:03] <labrador> Isnt neomutt very hard to configure Andrew ?
[17:34:07] <irelativism> labrador: try thunderbird
[17:34:10] <Andrew> labrador: Nope
[17:34:24] <labrador> I read that somewhere ig
[17:34:34] <Andrew> I might pack my configs (and strip out unnecessary private info) for you some time
[17:34:39] <labrador> oh
[17:34:41] <irelativism> was not thinking of pi but rk3998 based boards
[17:35:09] <labrador> Its probably not hard but time taking
[17:35:39] <Andrew> Hmm colors
[17:36:00] <Andrew> irelativism: Are they armv7/aarch64/x86/amd64?
[17:36:14] <irelativism> arm
[17:36:31] <irelativism> eventually will be risc-v though
[17:36:38] <irelativism> the prototipe will be risc-v
[17:36:42] <irelativism> that is
[17:36:51] <Andrew> I'm not sure if Plan 9 would run on risc-v

[18:08:32] <irelativism> yes I read about 9fs and 81/2

[22:40:10] <labrador> do you use key servers kompowiec ?
[22:40:20] <labrador> I think I'll use them
[22:41:04] <davisr> ggoes, fsf is the latest story on slashdot

[22:46:08] <kompowiec> i used keys once, for tests labrador 
[22:48:15] <GNUHacker> i dont trust in keyservers
[22:48:42] <kompowiec> all important things i just save in keepass
[22:48:44] <GNUHacker> i can up a fake key with your mail address to a keyserver

[23:00:01] <labrador> Ok yeah I thought about it kompowiec 
[23:00:16] <labrador> And I found a reason for using such a addressbook
[23:00:38] <labrador> Its that simply the keys shared in pgp are diffrent to cerificates
[23:01:16] <labrador> Certs in pki are simple and rock solid,whereas keys have so much stuff like uids,signs,subkeys that can be deleted
[23:01:42] <labrador> Like the key I gave to GNUHacker does not have three signatures I gained in the time period
[23:02:15] <labrador> So key servers basically make it so that everyone has the newest and most consistent copy of a key
[23:02:24] <labrador> And that I like
