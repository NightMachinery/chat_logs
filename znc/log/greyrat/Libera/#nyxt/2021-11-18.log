[20:41:18] <aartaka> ecraven: You were right about the resource-request not firing for every request. It only fires on iframe requests and page requests. Everyhthing else we don't hook into, but WebKit has "resourse-load-started" signal for it. I'm not sure whether one can block requests here.

[20:42:34] <mariari> aartaka: you fixed the bug with 203 video requests being done properly now
[20:42:44] <mariari> so it seems the history reload bug is for a separate issue?
[20:49:35] <ecraven> aartaka: thanks! I'll look into that
[20:51:05] <aartaka> mariari: Glad to hear that! History bug may have the same origin (us not processing all the error types), but it may be something totally unrelated. I'm not yet sure :/
[20:51:52] <aartaka> ecraven: good luck! If you'll manage to cancel requests, please ping me on that â€” we can use it in blocker-mode then.
[20:53:35] <mariari> aartaka: haven't tested it, just looking at it
[20:53:41] <mariari> nyxt currently for me is broken
[20:53:45] <mariari> I can hardly use it atm
[20:53:48] <mariari> let me test it really quickly
[20:54:47] <mariari> yeah it works fine
[20:55:13] <aartaka> 0_o
[20:55:32] <aartaka> mariari: you mean videos or history?
[20:55:35] <mariari> it crahses if I restore my history, and seems to segfault almost immadiately
[20:55:37] <mariari> videos
[20:55:40] <mariari> I can't test history
[20:55:46] <mariari> nyxt is too unstable for me atm to even use
[20:56:19] <mariari> it just crashes almost immediately upon startup or any amount of use for some reason
[20:57:08] <aartaka> mariari: What's the segfault message? I think I may have something similar in dev env.
[20:57:15] <mariari> https://pomf2.lain.la/f/0g80oyx.png
[20:57:20] <ecraven> aartaka: thanks, that signal looks good, now to see how to actually *block* stuff...
[20:57:22] <mariari> the 2nd link is upon restoring history
[20:57:28] <mariari> the last error here is typical with webkit
[20:59:15] <mariari> That last error happened when I C-x 5 2, I've found it just dies immaditely if I do anything
[20:59:47] <aartaka> ecraven: I thought about getting the URIRequest out of it and setting their URL to nothing. Other than that, I've no idea.
[21:00:11] <ecraven> I'll play around ;)
[21:00:24] <ecraven> I've asked in #webkit a few days ago, but that seems to be dead...
[21:00:35] <ecraven> but it has to work somehow, there *are* content blockers...
[21:04:42] <aartaka> ecraven: content blockers most probably use a different signal, the "send-request" from WebKitWebPage. It's not accessible from the usual browser context.
[21:05:20] <ecraven> what is it accessible from?
[21:06:13] <aartaka> ecraven: the WebKitWebExtension compiled to .so library is the only thing that you can access it in.
[21:07:14] <aartaka> ecraven: They sandbox these libraries, so you cannot communicate with it in Lisp.

[21:33:35] <ecraven> I still hate the fact that even *firefox* won't let me do things from the command line... why can't I even query the open tabs, or focus on a specific tab from *outside* firefox
[21:36:48] <ecraven> setting the uri doesn't work.. so it seems they deliberately designed it so there's no way to actually block things this way
[21:36:58] <ecraven> we could patch webkit... ;P
[22:03:41] <aartaka> ecraven: xD
[22:04:08] <aartaka> ecraven: Yeah, I've tried it too. Seems unavoidable patching, ahah.
