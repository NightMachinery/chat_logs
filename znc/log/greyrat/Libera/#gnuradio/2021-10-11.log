[04:43:44] <linge93[m]> In the demodulation process, module cycles like "polyphase clock sync"\"costas loop" and so on require a certain lock time, which means that some symbols have not been recovered correctly. If these data are wrong, then we will not get the Inputting exactly the same information is unreasonable for the communication system. How to deal with these errors?

[06:37:41] <tonys[m]1> :) wow finally i have a simulated run of FSK using GFSK mod, to mirror the device im trying to replicate...I couldnt however get GFSK demod to replicate what i already have with a pipeline of "quadrature demod" -> "decimating fir" -> "clock recovery mm" -> "binary filter". I cannot recover the same amount of data as with the original. Thanks to those that have answered my pleas. Now i will fine tune some more

[12:18:13] <linge93[m]> Hi,guys,Does anyone know how to determine the EVM of USRP? For example, the symbol I transmitted on gnuradio is 1+1i, then when the symbol is transmitted to the hardware, the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is also 1? Wouldn't it be an approximate value, such as 1.00001+0.999998i, and then up-converted?

[14:49:47] <linge93[m]> <linge93[m]> "Hi,guys,Does anyone know how..." <- I think there is a problem with what I said. I will describe it again. For example, I want to transmit 1.23456789+1.23456789i, but due to some hardware reasons (such as accuracy), it can only send 1.2+1.2i, which will appear like this Situation? Or does anyone know how to view this type of information?
[14:50:24] <DerekKozel[m]> Most radios only allow values between +-1 to be sent
[14:50:42] <DerekKozel[m]> the driver is scaling from that range to the min/max of the actual ADC
[14:51:52] <DerekKozel[m]> from GNU Radio I should say. The underlying drivers sometimes have direct access modes. The USRPs and some of the IIO blocks allow signed complex 16 bit integers to be sent
[14:56:17] <linge93[m]> <DerekKozel[m]> "Most radios only allow values..." <- In GNURadio, I cannot set the modulation symbol to a symbol greater than 1? But I have seen some examples before that the constellation setting of QPSK is 1.41...+1.41..i? Then connect it to USRPsink
[14:57:37] <DerekKozel[m]> I think that the Constellation object scales the values to be of magnitude 1 at greatest

[15:07:57] <linge93[m]> The amplitude exceeds 1, so I don’t quite understand what you said (-1,1) is for. The modulation constellation is in the unit circle?
[15:08:24] <DerekKozel[m]> I think that that signal will saturate a USRP transmitter
[15:09:15] <DerekKozel[m]> But I don't have the setup right now to test that. I'd scale that by 50% at least before transmitting so the max time domain value is ~0.9 to avoid the limits of the ADC

[15:17:12] <linge93[m]> <DerekKozel[m]> "the driver is scaling from..." <- How to zoom in here? What is the basis for determining the "actual ADC range" you mentioned? Assuming that my amplitude is now 0.7123456789+0.7123456789i, what will the value on the USRP hardware actually become? What is the accuracy?
[15:18:37] <DerekKozel[m]> You'll have to look at the manual for the specific USRP and the datasheet for the ADC/DAC to find the scaling range (number of bits) and the accuracy rating
[15:18:47] <matt_mills[m]> I have an I-dont-understand-DSP question... if I have a receiver that doesn't have I/Q outputs but can do FM demodulation, can I get that "back" into I/Q samples without losing data, assuming the receiver isn't doing any filtering on the fm output?

[16:35:01] <jemius> I have awkward behavior with a fir_filter class. Setting coefficients to [1] results in a sinus (input) becoming a sinus at the output. Setting coeffs to [1, 0] causes awkward pulsations at frequencies which should not exist. Any idea or hint what this might be? filterN() should only result in N samples being produced by the filter, so I don't expect a missing- or too-many-samples problem

[16:45:15] <jemius> It grows up and down periodically. Almost as if it is alive *scared

[16:50:33] <jemius> I'm not sure if I understand the filter functions correctly, though. filterN() should produce exactly N samples, I guess. And if the convolution would be longer than N, it will take that into account when it's next called
[16:51:44] <willcode4[m]> Don't read too much into the fluctuations, as the display is sampled. Turn on averaging, or save to a file and look at the result with inspectrum. Also, use a throttle inline if you are not already.

[21:18:40] <Macuser> I actually have another question DerekKozel[m], how would I view the Symbol Table that's been generated as a result of that equation. It doesn't fully display on the block so is there a place to access it
[21:20:41] <DerekKozel[m]> Check it from a Python terminal would be easiest
[21:21:49] <DerekKozel[m]> from gnuradio import digital
[21:21:49] <DerekKozel[m]> print(digital.psk_constellation(4, 'gray'))
[21:22:13] <DerekKozel[m]> Eer. .points()
[21:23:02] <Macuser> of course.
[21:23:06] <Macuser> thx.
[21:26:32] <flash[m]> who is the best person to talk about the scheduler?
[21:30:09] <JoshMorman[m]> It depends what aspect of the scheduler you're interested in discussing

[21:32:39] <flash[m]> I have a signal source block that is dropping packets. Trying to trace things downstream, I have an optional block with a very large output multiple (2048 * 1024). When that block is in place, I seem to keep up servicing the source
[21:33:01] <flash[m]> when it is not in place, I run on the order of 0.5 real time or slower
[21:34:02] <flash[m]> the processing block downstream of that one reads samples and produces something else ... metadata. So it returns 0 frequently
[21:34:16] <Jacob[m]123> is the downstream block a general_block (using `general_work()`)?
[21:34:24] <flash[m]> yes
[21:34:34] <flash[m]> it consumes input, but produces no output
[21:35:38] <Jacob[m]123> consider using `forecast()` to require more input items be available per work function call, this should help reduce the need to set very large output multiples
[21:35:58] <Jacob[m]123> 2M items is a lot though...
[21:36:13] <flash[m]> yes, it's running a 0.25 second FFT
[21:36:18] <flash[m]> over 8msps
[21:36:45] <flash[m]> the odd thing is, that seems to HELP
[21:37:36] <Jacob[m]123> right, very large output multiples can certainly help in cases like that.
[21:38:05] *** Joins: pcero (~pcero@187.135.224.134)
[21:38:32] <Jacob[m]123> the reason the source is dropping data is because that last block is running too slowly and GR is backpressuring to the source block
[21:39:59] <flash[m]> sure. I'm trying to figure out what the slow block is. My current suspect is the samples->metadata block but I'm still not sure
[21:40:19] <flash[m]> I've tried examining the pc_* buffer variables, but they always seem to be 0
[21:40:55] <JoshMorman[m]> is gr built with performance counters enabled, and are they enabled in the config file?
[21:41:31] <flash[m]> I built using more-or-less defaults, so I didn't disable them. If I read properly, the default is to have them on
[21:41:43] <flash[m]> I haven't touched the config file
[21:42:59] <JoshMorman[m]> [perfcounters]
[21:42:59] <JoshMorman[m]> clock = thread
[21:42:59] <JoshMorman[m]> export = False
[21:42:59] <JoshMorman[m]> on = False
[21:43:13] <JoshMorman[m]> I think they are off in the config by default
[21:44:08] <flash[m]> meh. You are right. That was a major oversight. Thanks for that one
[21:45:54] <Jacob[m]123> i had something similar to this happen before, where i needed a very large upstream output buffer. i solved it by setting a very large history size
[21:48:01] <flash[m]> can you explain? I've been looking for information on how to set buffer sizes, and it's not clear to me
[21:48:39] <Jacob[m]123> https://github.com/jacobagilbert/gr-fhss_utils/blob/master/lib/fft_burst_tagger_impl.cc#L134
[21:49:10] <Jacob[m]123> there is a comment before this call
[21:49:41] <Jacob[m]123> s/call/line that describes the need in this block/
[21:51:23] <flash[m]> unfortunately, the C++ API has no documentation for set_history()
[21:56:50] <Jacob[m]123> the doxygen (https://www.gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/classgr_1_1block.html#ac2dac90e45498ad53a19544c01114136) is lacking, but there is some good info on the wiki https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Guided_Tutorial_GNU_Radio_in_C%2B%2B
[21:59:23] <flash[m]> it looks like my block is trying to handle buffing itself. Am I wrong in thinking that if you need "fft_size" samples to run an FFT, you should set output_multiple to "fft_size"?
[21:59:27] <flash[m]> https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/a9a55d7156a1615fa6bceafd20d22d01df511b32/src/algorithms/acquisition/gnuradio_blocks/pcps_acquisition.cc#L892
[22:00:01] <Jacob[m]123> yeah, that is reasonable here i suppose
[22:01:07] <flash[m]> ok. I'll try changing that block to ask for what it needs and see if that helps. Thanks

[23:32:01] <flash[m]> the purpose of forecast() is to specify the ratio of input items to output items, yes?
[23:32:30] <flash[m]> so for a given "noutput_items" argument, the number of required inputs is "noutput_items * ratio"?
