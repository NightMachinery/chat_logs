[00:49:33] <JulianJulianBerm> A design would be letting `util.launch` allow configurably coercing a buffer name to a "real" buffer name
[00:50:04] <JulianJulianBerm> And then (thinking about defaults aside), being able to insert calling `vim.fn.FugitiveReal()` to support fugitive buffers.

[01:00:23] <JulianJulianBerm> (Whether lspconfig has the fugitive-specific code is yeah separate I suppose, that indeed would be fine if it just lived in some downstream other plugin)
[01:00:42] <mjlbach[m]> I mean you can manually attach a language server or launch a language server with start_client
[01:01:01] <JulianJulianBerm> Right but I want to participate with all the lspconfig root discovery

[01:07:18] <JulianJulianBerm> LSP clients are started up if you run `nvim foo.whatever`

[18:08:14] <SergioArielAlons> clason:   Yeaph, I tried that. It didn't works. I think it's related to some CodeArt configuration
[18:09:23] <clason[m]> well, then you have to raise the issue with whatever CodeArt is. To the question as stated, this is the only answer.

[19:56:41] <YorickPeterse[m]> Is there a way to apply what is basically `scrolloff` but on a one-time basis, without resorting to `jjjkkk` for example? Basically I have some mappings for quickfix/loclists that let me jump around a bit nicer, but I would like them to add a bit of padding when an entry is the first or last line, so it's easier to see the context
[19:56:43] <YorickPeterse[m]> I have snippet in place that sort of does this by applying `zz` if the cursor is on the first/last line, but it's a bit jarring to center it
[19:56:58] <YorickPeterse[m]> I was thinking of just setting `scrolloff` before the jump, then resetting it, but I wonder if there's a better way
[19:57:16] <YorickPeterse[m]> so basically the equivalent of `set scrolloff=3 | lnext | set scrolloff=0`
[19:58:09] <YorickPeterse[m]> I suppose I could also feed `C-e` / `C-y` a few times

[23:18:03] <gpanders> LeoNerd: is this comment from 6 years ago still an accurate assessment of the situation? https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3991#issuecomment-170946627
[23:18:24] <gpanders> Or is libtickit at a point now where Neovim could use it?
