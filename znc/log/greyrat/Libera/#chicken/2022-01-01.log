[01:10:06] <kbradyno> Hi all, I'm new to chicken and scheme in general and I had a question. Sorry if this has been asked a lot, but I wondered if there was any experiments compiling chicken to web assembly? It seems like it could be possible but I couldn't find any information on anyone having tried yet...
[01:15:36] <wasamasa> I remember someone trying to port it to emscripten, but failing due to alloca not being supported
[01:18:31] <kbradyno> Ah, I see. Thanks!

[01:34:31] <mario-goulart> I was able to compile a CHICKEN program with emscripten (relatively complicated with a bunch of eggs).  Compilation worked, but execution didn't. :-)

[01:37:39] <mario-goulart> Compilation of CHICKEN with emscripten also worked (I seem to remember I needed -DSEARCH_EXE_PATH), but I was not able to run the command line tools (I tried with nodejs).

[01:38:55] <mario-goulart> It was a quick try, though.  I don't really understand much about what emscripten generates and how its output is supposed to work.

[01:40:23] <kbradyno> Bummer. Even if it was quite possible, without a really detailed guide I think it would be far beyond me to try to get it working. It's a shame, I don' t know of any scheme project that works in-browser.
[01:41:10] <mario-goulart> I didn't have any problem with alloca.  I remember seing something related with longjump in the runtime error messages on the browser.  But I don't know what that was about (that was the execution of the complicated program).
[01:41:31] <mario-goulart> kbradyno: there's spock (http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/spock)
[01:42:54] <mario-goulart> https://scheme.rs/comparator/ is made with spock.  Code here: https://git.sr.ht/%7Eamirouche/scheme.rs

[23:21:46] <aportnoy> How do I generate random numbers in chicken? (import random) doesn't work, I get "Error: (import) during expansion of (import ...) - cannot import from undefined module: random"
[23:25:25] <megane> it's (import (chicken random))
[23:26:09] <aportnoy> megane: Got it, thanks. What are the semantics of (chicken ...) ?
[23:27:27] <megane> iirc import transforms (chicken random) into chicken.random
[23:27:49] <megane> chicken.random is the actual module name
[23:28:11] <aportnoy> megane: Ah, so (chicken random) isn't a function call.
[23:28:40] <megane> no. import is a macro with it's own semantics
[23:28:52] <aportnoy> Got it, thank you so much.
