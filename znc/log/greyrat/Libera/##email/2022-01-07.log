[05:07:13] <BCB> why does gmail reject VERP emails?
[05:08:47] <lunaphyte> why do you believe that gmail rejects verp emails?
[05:12:27] <BCB> lunaphyte becuase I use gmail as my mail server and it bounced all my bounce emails back to my: info-EUID-122161-2520@mygmailserver.org
[05:13:13] <lunaphyte> and gmail rejects no other messages you send, at all, except for those specific messages?
[05:13:16] <BCB> *me
[05:16:26] <BCB> lunaphyte but when I send it to my own mail server it accepts it
[05:16:32] <BCB> lunaphyte from gmail: https://pastbin.net/raw/gmail-bounce
[05:16:44] <lunaphyte> gmail rejects no other messages you send, at all, except for those specific messages?
[05:17:36] <BCB> lunaphyte correct
[05:22:01] <jimpop> if it's a GSuite account, you have to register (and maybe pay for) every inbound address that you plan to utilize
[05:25:04] <BCB> jimpop I have a free nonprofit gsuite account.  (It's now called Workspace)  Had it for years.
[05:25:22] <jimpop> congrats?
[05:26:05] <jimpop> you still have to register and identify every inbound address.  GSuite won't accept *@domain.tld
[05:30:49] <BCB> jimpop interesting... however every email is unique: info-EUID-122161-2520@myemailserver.org
[05:30:58] <BCB> info@myemailserver.org
[05:31:07] <BCB> exists
[05:31:42] <jimpop> does info-EUID-122161-2520@mygmailserver.org ?
[05:39:36] <BCB> jimpop what?
[05:40:05] <BCB> the number change with every email to uniquely identify each emails.
[05:49:54] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@177.246.216.115)
[05:55:20] <jimpop> you still have to register and identify every inbound address.  GSuite won't accept *@domain.tld
[05:59:03] <pj> jimpop: where does this come from?  I have had google apps, which is now workspace for years and never had to register inbound addresses.
[06:06:43] <jimpop> i haven't set one up in ~2 years, but I know enterprise gsuite requires you to add every inbound account address before you can receive email at that account. e.g. no wildcard addresses.  It's something like $5 USD/email address
[06:07:23] <pj> yeah, mine is workspace, which used to be google apps.  It was one of the original free accounts that is now grandfathered in.
[06:07:52] <pj> and I never had to register inbound addresses with it.
[06:09:59] <BCB> pj yea me too
[06:10:28] <BCB> but it bounces VERP emails :-(
[06:10:53] <BCB> what does "no_milters" mean in a bounced email??
[06:11:44] <jimpop> i wonder if you could try using info+EUID-122161-2520@mygmailserver.org
[06:12:11] <pj> bcb: they're doing address verification on the envelope sender (which is the VERP address).
[06:12:37] <BCB> jimpop I'll try that
[06:12:38] <pj> The reason gmail is bouncing is because your VERP is set up incorrectly.  Any envelope sender, VERP or otherwise needs to be routable.
[06:12:49] <BCB> pj explain, please
[06:14:41] <pj> can you send an email to info-EUID-122161-2520@mygmailserver.org?
[06:15:14] *** Joins: furrymcg1e (~devuan@cgn-89-1-210-27.nc.de)
[06:15:35] <BCB> pj no it fails: https://pastbin.net/raw/gmail-bounce
[06:15:40] <pj> mygmailserver.org is your workspace domain, correct?
[06:15:45] <BCB> correct
[06:15:50] <BCB> fake name but yes
[06:16:01] <pj> right so google knows all of the valid recipients in that domain
[06:16:16] <BCB> pj correct.  I created them
[06:16:17] <pj> so if it sees a message coming from an envelope sender that it doesn't know about then it bounces.
[06:16:34] <BCB> pj so I can't use gmail to receive VERP emails
[06:16:41] <BCB> ?
[06:16:53] <pj> gmail can recieve them but you can't use the same domain as the envelope sender.
[06:17:06] <pj> you need to set up a separate domain for that which isn't registered through gmail.
[06:17:06] <BCB> will jimpop's suggestion work:  info+EUID-122161-2520@mygmailserver.org
[06:17:26] <pj> it might, yes
[06:17:28] <BCB> pj.  Yea, I fitured that out but if I switch the sender domain the emial fails
[06:17:40] *** Quits: furrymcg1e (~devuan@cgn-89-1-210-27.nc.de) (Client Quit)
[06:17:49] <pj> because google will see it as info@ and the rest as an address extension
[06:17:57] <pj> so as long as info@ exists it would be okay
[06:18:07] <BCB> pj hmmm... ok.  let me try that
[06:18:37] <pj> but ... thing is
[06:18:47] *** Quits: furrymcgee (~devuan@cgn-89-1-208-247.nc.de) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[06:18:49] <pj> what's the point of VERP if you're not routing the envelope sender?
[06:19:15] <pj> presumably the sending system needs to be able to receive bounce messages to that address so it can process them.
[06:19:25] <pj> otherwise why are you even bothering with VERP to begin with?
[06:20:38] <BCB> pj I am the sender
[06:20:54] <pj> I get that, but the point of VERP is to do automated processing of bounce messages.
[06:20:55] <BCB> so was to parse these addresses so I can remove bounced emails
[06:21:04] * jimpop wonders if it's verp or pvrs
[06:21:06] <pj> I think you may be missing that.
[06:21:13] <BCB> pj  ??
[06:21:55] <BCB> jimpop not familiar with pvrs
[06:22:03] <pj> neitehr am I, tbh
[06:22:38] <jimpop> BATV stuff
[06:22:39] <BCB> ok but yes.  I want to programatically process bounced emails by reading the VERP addresses that uniquely identify each emails
[06:22:42] <pj> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_Address_Tag_Validation
[06:23:11] <pj> bcb: and how do you plan to read those addresses?
[06:23:46] <BCB> log into the via imap with php and process them
[06:23:52] <pj> BCB: let me back up and explain what I'm asking you...
[06:23:52] <BCB> *server
[06:24:02] <BCB> ok
[06:24:03] <pj> You do understand what the envelope sender is and how it's used, right?
[06:24:05] <pj> !sender
[06:24:07] <dig-dug> pj: I do not know about 'sender', but I do know about these similar topics: 'from!=sender', 'sender!=from'
[06:24:13] <pj> !envelope
[06:24:14] <dig-dug> pj: envelope: SMTP has MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands. Addresses in those commands are envelope addresses. There is no requirement that they appear in any header.
[06:24:49] <pj> anyways, the envelope sender is the address that a recipient server will send a bounce message to if there's an issue delivering the message.
[06:25:02] <pj> it's different from the From: header
[06:25:27] <BCB> correct
[06:26:10] <pj> so if your message has an envelope sender of, say, bounce_processing@example.com but a From: header of bcb@example.com, the message will appear to the recipient as if it's coming from bcb@, but any bounce messages will be sent to the envelope sender (bounce_processing@)...
[06:26:40] <pj> so the way that VERP works is it creates a unique address and sets it to the envelope sender...
[06:26:56] <pj> and if that message bounces the bounce message is sent back to that unique address...
[06:27:13] <pj> and the server will receive that message and know what to do with it.
[06:27:18] <BCB> correct
[06:27:23] <BCB> that is the way it is set up
[06:27:25] <BCB> https://pastbin.net/raw/email-header
[06:27:41] <BCB> the sender address is the VERP address
[06:27:57] <pj> brb
[06:28:01] <BCB> k
[06:28:16] <BCB> I'm still testing jimpop's suggestion. Give me a few.
[06:30:31] <pj> okay ... so
[06:31:23] <pj> if that envelope sender is not a valid recipient itself, then the bounce message can't be received by anything, the bounce message itself bounces.
[06:32:08] <pj> so if you're using VERP and the envelope sender looks like seemingly_random_string@example.com and example.com doesn't know how to process that recipient, then VERP won't work.
[06:32:44] <pj> which is what you're basically trying to do, you had info-some_randomness@mygmailserver.org
[06:33:13] <pj> and mygmailserver.org (which is basically google) didn't know how to process that, who to send it to or what to do with it.
[06:33:38] <pj> so google complained and was refusing to accept the message at all.
[06:33:55] <pj> so now you're changing that to info+some_random_garbage@...
[06:34:14] <pj> and google says, "info, I know that, I know where to deliver that" so it will let the message through.
[06:34:26] <pj> but when the bounce comes back, it will end up in the info@ mailbox
[06:34:41] <pj> and so the question is, does info@ know how to process that VERP address?
[06:36:56] <pj> so my earlier question was based on the fact that your envelope sender was unroutable, and how do you plan to do VERP on an unroutable envelope sender, and since you're changing it to + to make it routable, does that really change how you're going to process it or are you doing that just to try to get google to accept the message in the first place (but still not be able to process the bounce message)?
[06:43:03] <BCB> jimpop it worked!
[06:43:06] <BCB> Thank you!
[06:43:35] <lunaphyte> can gmail use characters apart from + for address extensions?
[06:45:22] <BCB> lunaphyte no idea "-" did not work but "+" did work.  Not sure where that gmail documentation is located
[06:45:33] <lunaphyte> that's too bad
[06:45:39] <lunaphyte> i wonder if . would work.
[06:45:57] <lunaphyte> i seem to recall something about how gmail "ignores" dots, or something like that
[06:46:45] <BCB> lunaphyte "+" works fine for me.  NO MORE TESTING!!
[06:47:01] <BCB> no my mail server is reporting this with the bounced email: https://pastbin.net/raw/my-mail-server-bounce-report
[06:47:22] <lunaphyte> just beware that + could be at a higher risk for issues, that's all
[06:47:44] <BCB> lunaphyte what issues.
[06:48:03] <BCB> re: my mail server what to all those @my-mail-server.net addresses mean in that pastbin
[06:48:06] <BCB> anyone know
[06:48:18] <BCB> https://pastbin.net/raw/my-mail-server-bounce-report
[06:48:30] <lunaphyte> deliverability issues
[06:48:59] <BCB> lunaphyte right - the test email is know to bounce.  what does all that mean?
[06:49:13] <BCB> lunaphyte is that a log level setting.  
[06:49:17] <BCB> ??
[06:49:37] <BCB> I don't recall all seeing all the data reported previously
[06:50:27] <pj> lunaphyte: gmail ignores dots insofar as foo.bar@gmail.com is the same as foobar@gmail.com
[06:50:37] <pj> but it's not an address extension character.
[06:51:47] <BCB> what about my pastebin.  Any thought?
[06:55:13] <BCB> FYI:https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html
[06:55:20] <BCB> dots and pluses
[06:57:29] <lunaphyte> i see
[06:59:12] <pj> BCB: I have no idea what generated that pastebin or what you expect to see there.
[07:01:32] <lunaphyte> is it ascii art of a rabbit with a pancake on its head?
[07:03:46] <pj> lunaphyte: nope, this one has a waffle
[07:03:53] <lunaphyte> yum
[07:04:08] <pj> ...with strawberries and whipped cream
[07:05:43] <lunaphyte> man... i just brushed my teeth :(
[07:06:15] <BCB> pj me neither.  As long as it is work.
