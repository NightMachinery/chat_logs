[11:29:37] <ButterNoodle> $60 steak? yes pls cook it the correct way u guys think
[11:29:57] <MootPoot> another thing - my parents are more obsessed with style then actually what's going on 
[11:29:59] <MootPoot> makes no sense
[11:30:11] <ButterNoodle> flavor over form
[11:30:25] <MootPoot> like - they'll make a huge fuss about you have to skewer the meat on sticks and THEN put it in the oven
[11:30:25] <ButterNoodle> flavor gonna make dem good smelling farts later..
[11:30:31] <ButterNoodle> make me hungry all over again

[11:51:32] <Satin> was out of there within 10m? i was shaking but maybe sleep deprived so not bothered as much as i should be
[11:51:52] <Satin> then i had my appointment and decided to drive down towards Albuquerque again
[11:52:17] <Satin> except that my idea that it was going to be better wasn't true and the roads were even worse in the dark sometimes pfft

[13:20:45] <MootPoot> like , do you host your own email server?
[13:21:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope. Hosting an email server would be too much a security risk. I'll consider that some days later after figuring out all the security shit.

[14:13:39] <MootPoot> Well, it's headless so it's just in another room 
[14:14:23] <rando25892> at lug it was the rpi3 to be the choice because they didnt want to have to install a heatsink
[14:16:27] <MootPoot> amigojapan: they were going to make a rpi5 - the design is already complete but they aren't making it due to the chip shortage
[14:16:28] <rando25892> looks like rpi4 has gigabit thats pretty good for a device that size

[14:16:50] <MootPoot> that's to be expected

[14:20:03] <MootPoot> maybe 2026

[16:40:25] <MootPoot> yeah, idk where you live but a big thing is WHERE you get them from
[16:40:34] <MootPoot> IRL retail stores still massively overcharge for flash storage
[16:40:56] <Terminus> also bought them because all my USB drives are over 10 years old and the biggest one is 8 GB. all of them are only USB 2.0 too.

[17:41:02] <Bco1981> including sub folders
[17:41:05] <MootPoot> yep
[17:41:07] <MootPoot> did that
[17:41:21] <MootPoot> it was all data from windows store installs

[17:48:11] <MootPoot> maybe if I get a job I'll get some more ssds

[17:51:48] <Sadale> I don't get nvme.
[17:51:57] <lastonestanding> roger that!
[17:52:18] <Sadale> I mean, it does help with SSD speed. But still, by how much? Is that even worth the extra cost and the backward compatibility with sata?
[17:52:25] <Bco1981> Sadale: no cables, more clean build.
[17:52:27] <Rue> what's everyone using to download anime these days? i haven't watched anime in a while. kind of want to get back into it again :P Nyaa? are Bakabt and Animebytes still good?
[17:52:31] <Sadale> oh space hto.
[17:52:34] <Sadale> space tho.
[17:52:45] <MootPoot> extra cost dosent exist unless you are talking larger then 2tb Sadale

[17:53:17] <Bco1981> with big files yes. massive.
[17:53:19] <Sadale> ah. It may be helpful for laptop.
[17:53:22] <MootPoot> 450-500MBps  vs 4000-7000 etc
[17:53:38] <Sadale> yeah as if you'd need 4000-7000MB/s
[17:53:47] * MootPoot smacks Sadale 
[17:53:53] <Sadale> Even 4K hentai wouldn't take 4000mbps

[17:54:00] <MootPoot> ^
[17:54:18] <MootPoot> if you edit 4k video and you need a scratch drive 
[17:54:23] <MootPoot> that speed comes in handy
[17:54:26] <Bco1981> Sadale: everytime i play beat saber i generate a video file of 50+ gbyte
[17:54:32] <Sadale> ah.
[17:54:38] <Sadale> That's a valid point
[17:54:58] <MootPoot> 4k raw is like above 1gbps 
[17:55:00] <Bco1981> biggest so far is 74gbyte
[17:55:09] <MootPoot> or was it gb/min
[17:55:23] <Sadale> Let's do the math.
[17:55:24] <MootPoot> and also the serial write is always a lie - IRL you get like 80% of that
[17:55:35] <MootPoot> but it does help with faster random access
[17:55:44] <MootPoot> for consumer applications it dosen't really matter

[18:00:44] <MootPoot> and if you have more then one cameraman....
[18:01:01] <Sadale> sounds like a opportunity for false-reimbursement profit :P

[18:01:14] <MootPoot> lol
[18:01:17] <MootPoot> 100k is cheap

[18:01:38] <MootPoot> its not fraudulent though?

[18:01:58] <Sadale> I mean purchasing cheap substitute without letting your superior knows. :P
[18:02:00] <MootPoot> you'd just call it fraud

[18:02:14] <Sadale> alright. I've decided. I'll be joining the filming industry :3
[18:02:32] <MootPoot> when you manage to get to hollywood level production you'll be holding a 300k camera
[18:02:33] <MootPoot> lol
[18:02:37] <Sadale> Assuming that I need 1M for retirement, I'd only need to perform this fraud 4 times and I can retire :D

[18:03:22] <MootPoot> your boss dosen't give you 300k though
[18:03:31] <MootPoot> they buy it through the purchasing department

[18:03:48] <MootPoot> once you are at that size
[18:04:17] <Sadale> doesn't matter. I could just sneak into the department and replace the real thing with the cheap substitute. Then sell the real thing in black market for BTC

[18:05:48] <MootPoot> they dont leave stuff like that just lying around
[18:05:57] <Sadale> oh. That'd be another easy route to do the substitution. I could be the security guard.
[18:06:09] <MootPoot> the security guard dosen't get to touch it lol
[18:06:16] <MootPoot> they'll just get informed that you're trying to steal it

[23:48:36] <ButterNoodle> just like ur wife can fake it.. so can sophisticated machines..
[23:48:37] <davic> doing accounting
[23:48:43] <ButterNoodle> davic: stop
[23:48:47] <ButterNoodle> its not worth it
[23:48:58] <davic> then I wont get salari
[23:51:25] <|xD> ButterNoodle: I am no physics dude but i had fiber optics course at uni :)
[23:52:03] <ButterNoodle> well ur course was shit.. as evident by that statement and the fact that u thing multimode is "better" than single mode
[23:52:24] <ButterNoodle> a CCNA boot camp may fix that
[23:52:52] <|xD> multimode is easier to work with
[23:52:56] <|xD> i dont have a splicer
[23:52:56] <|xD> :P
[23:53:03] <ButterNoodle> I dont disagree with that statement
[23:53:17] <ButterNoodle> I run mm in the house
[23:53:19] <|xD> and at home i dont need more modes
[23:53:35] <|xD> 10g via cat7 is fine
[23:53:36] <ButterNoodle> mainly bc abundance of optics
[23:53:45] <ButterNoodle> yea I dont have those

[23:57:40] <ButterNoodle> ur fucked then buddy
[23:57:40] <|xD> lol
[23:58:05] <|xD> depends :)
[23:58:16] <|xD> how the triangle is
[23:58:51] <|xD> if one side 90° you can assume
[23:59:22] <ButterNoodle> ur already dead
