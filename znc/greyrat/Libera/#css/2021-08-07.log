[00:27:33] <lind{at}yahoo> oh it does, it just not show a scroll bar
[00:27:46] <lind{at}yahoo> on desktop it shows a scroll bar, mobile (both safari and edge) do not
[00:28:05] <entuland> that's odd, it should show the scrollbar - it does for me on desktop if I narrow the window down enough

[00:29:26] <entuland> uhm...
[00:29:34] <entuland> I checked on chrome desktop in mobile mode
[00:29:48] <entuland> and indeed it hides the scrollbar unless you actively try and scroll
[00:30:13] <entuland> can't tell if there is a workaround to force the bar to show there
[00:31:25] <entuland> have a look here, lind{at}yahoo https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar
[00:32:47] <entuland> also this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scrollbars
[00:33:09] <entuland> ah no that last one is only for firefox, so that's likely not what you want
[00:35:12] <lind{at}yahoo> hmmm, I'm not able to parse the docs and intellisense in code is giving me a ton of options, what values would I be looking for in that?
[00:35:50] <entuland> can't tell, it's a page I linked so you could study if there is something that may help, it's experimental technology that may or may not help for your case
[00:36:13] <entuland> you could add some text (using a pseudo-element) only under a certain width, so that you can inform the user about the fact of the table being scrollable

[01:18:19] <wombawomba> So I have a grid layout div with `flex: 1` and `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr`, that sits inside a flexbox element. I was expecting the second row to fill all remaining height, but it has the same height as it's contents. How can I get it to fill up the remaining space?
[01:19:40] <wombawomba> Btw I noticed that setting the height of the grid div to _any value_ gives the intended effect (no idea why)... but that seems like a bit of a hack? Is there a better way?

[01:32:35] <lind{at}yahoo> entuland: so I added a png of a scrollbar beneath the table which displays at <=470px
[01:32:45] <lind{at}yahoo> live at http://thespaceforce.world
[01:33:57] <entuland> doesn't look like a good idea hahahah
[01:34:16] <entuland> sorry, couldn't help it
[01:35:47] <entuland> you should put some text like "The following table can be scrolled horizontally if there isn't enough room" or "Yo! The horizontal scrollbar for the following table may or may not appear on mobile but it's there, it's the aliens' fault!" or the alike
[01:36:55] <entuland> or you replace the table with a fancy link to another page showing only the table and a "best viewed in landscape mode"
[01:37:12] <entuland> that's the kind of issues that you get dealing with rigid tables
[01:37:24] <lind{at}yahoo> another page could be interesting
[01:38:07] <lind{at}yahoo> there's no way using jscript I could generally change the orientation of the browser....
[01:38:10] <entuland> you could as well do another thing
[01:38:14] <entuland> which may be a good idea
[01:38:20] <entuland> but let me ask you one thing first
[01:38:54] <entuland> that lineup between the USSF/Nato levels and The Space Force (NATO) levels
[01:39:05] <entuland> is that something that is officially listed somewhere?
[01:39:36] <lind{at}yahoo> it's on page 13 of http://multiplex.studio/files/CognitiveCyberwar.pdf which is linked above it on mobile and to the left on desktop
[01:39:38] <entuland> ah wait
[01:40:14] <entuland> I thought that the first and the second columns were official columns
[01:40:23] <entuland> only the first one is official I guess
[01:40:27] <lind{at}yahoo> correct
[01:40:41] <entuland> what about Starfleet UN
[01:40:49] <entuland> is that an official ranking?
[01:40:59] <lind{at}yahoo> well official externally, The Space Force is an unrecognized NGO (Starfleet as well)
[01:41:11] <entuland> yep that's what I meant
[01:41:24] <entuland> first, governative "official", second and third NGO, correct?
[01:41:30] <lind{at}yahoo> correct
[01:41:37] <entuland> okay
[01:41:55] <entuland> what if you make three tables?
[01:42:06] <lind{at}yahoo> hrmmm
[01:42:12] <entuland> you have A, B and C with many empty spots
[01:42:26] <entuland> you can make AB, BC, AC tables
[01:42:33] <lind{at}yahoo> it's kind of meant to compare and contrast
[01:42:44] <lind{at}yahoo> well not kind of, it is
[01:43:45] <entuland> may be that I have no idea of what it is meant to convey, but it just looks to me "hey, look, we give different names to somewhat vaguely identified roles" (no offence intended, it's just how it comes across)
[01:43:59] <wombawomba> entuland: here https://jsfiddle.net/tmp28eq1/
[01:44:07] <entuland> also because there is no explanation of what O1, O2 OS1 and OJ1 and so forth mean
[01:44:39] <wombawomba> I would like the grid row containing 'C' to take up the rest of the grid's height
[01:45:05] <wombawomba> Adding `height: 0` on `.grid` seems to fix it, but I have no idea why
[01:45:20] <lind{at}yahoo> entuland: oh shit I forgot to put Officer, Officer-Space and Officer-Joint below the table
[01:46:20] <lind{at}yahoo> entuland: also the next section, which is the apply, will discuss the roles and responsibilities of each OS/OJ ranking
[01:46:47] <entuland> can't tell, probably it's just my ignorance on the matter, lind
[01:47:44] <lind{at}yahoo> this is wiki's write up on the NATO ranks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranks_and_insignia_of_NATO
[01:47:57] <entuland> wombawomba, need to separate the techniques first
[01:48:20] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/ucq9bng2/
[01:48:29] <entuland> with that you can see the behavior of the cells within the grid
[01:48:47] <wombawomba> hmm
[01:48:51] <entuland> now, separately, you just have to make sure that the outer div adapts to its parent, whichever the parent
[01:48:56] <entuland> don't let the two things mix up
[01:49:04] <entuland> or you're up for some headaches
[01:49:27] <wombawomba> okay, yeah
[01:49:39] <wombawomba> the problem is that I can't really change the containing flexbox
[01:49:49] <wombawomba> because it's used for a bunch of other views
[01:50:08] <entuland> not enough context to understand the problem
[01:50:24] <wombawomba> maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but
[01:51:02] <entuland> you could add a wrapper, force a minimum height directly as I'm doing, add a class that only targets the flexing parent only in a specific context, add a flex-basis to the "gridded" element that will be taken in account by the parent flex context
[01:51:07] <entuland> there are many different ways
[01:51:27] <wombawomba> what I meant was that I don't really want to modify the `main` element if I can help it
[01:51:55] <entuland> try and reproduce the real problem in the fiddle
[01:51:55] <wombawomba> cleaned up the example btw:
[01:51:57] <wombawomba> https://jsfiddle.net/tmp28eq1/2/
[01:52:13] <entuland> there is nothing with a "flex" class
[01:52:40] <wombawomba> ooh sorry, guess I optimized that class away
[01:53:30] <wombawomba> yeah no okay, this is a correct reproduction of the problem: https://jsfiddle.net/tmp28eq1/2/
[01:54:02] <wombawomba> and this solves the problem: https://jsfiddle.net/tmp28eq1/2/

[01:58:31] <entuland> aye
[01:58:39] <entuland> removing the height works fine on firefox
[01:58:42] <entuland> looks like a quirck
[01:58:47] <entuland> quirk *
[01:59:13] <wombawomba> eeep
[01:59:22] <wombawomba> it doesn't work at all in safari
[02:00:00] <wombawomba> if I don't set the height C overflows, but if I do it behaves as if I hadn't set a height in chrome
[02:04:00] <wombawomba> setting an explicit height for the grid seems to do the trick, but I can't really do that (because in my app, main contains other elements as well)
[02:05:06] <wombawomba> setting `height` instead of `min-height` on `main` seems to solve the problem in all browsers, but I'm not sure I can do that either
[02:05:17] <entuland> can't tell, there seems something odd going on there
[02:07:25] <wombawomba> yeah
[02:07:37] <wombawomba> weird, this seems like the kind of simple use-case that should just work
[02:08:01] <wombawomba> I think I can set `overflow: auto` and `height: 60vh` on `main` and it'll be fine
[02:08:16] <wombawomba> I'll try that and hopefully it'll work out :)
[02:08:18] <wombawomba> thanks for the help
[02:09:07] <entuland> arghhhh
[02:09:10] <entuland> I think I found the issue

[02:26:16] <entuland> wombawomba, this, this makes me think there is something wrong around: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/r735ntxa/
[02:26:35] <entuland> the background is yellow all the way down to the end of main
[02:27:14] <entuland> but the grid itself doesn't fill up
[02:32:05] <wombawomba> yeah very weird
[02:32:27] <wombawomba> is nesting flex and grid not supposed to work perhaps?
[02:32:40] <entuland> oh no it should work just fine
[02:32:46] <wombawomba> hmm
[02:32:56] <wombawomba> flex and min-height then?
[02:33:33] <wombawomba> maybe how they're supposed to interact isn't properly defined
[02:34:06] <entuland> no, it doesn't make sense that the yellow background extends all the way down and the grid doesn't
[02:34:08] <entuland> it's a bug
[02:34:38] <entuland> https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=784059
[02:35:23] <entuland> notice how they mention "indefinite height" which is exactly what you're "fixing" with "height: 0"
[02:35:37] <wombawomba> ah yeah
[02:36:02] <wombawomba> so presumably there's another similar bug in Safari then
[02:36:16] <entuland> may very well be
[02:37:13] <wombawomba> lucky for me, it seems I was able to swap out `min-height` to `height` without any major breakage
[02:38:08] <wombawomba> so it seems I won't have to worry about this, at least for now

[06:38:14] <lind{at}yahoo> I solved it, so what was happening mobile edge treats vh markup correctly: doesn’t include the navigation, chrome and safari count those - so the main width on my body has to be 87vh for chrome/safari and 100vh on edge
[06:39:00] <oksushi> sounds like a magic number

[17:29:14] <entuland> FightingFalcon, you should probably aggregate them as needed on the server side, it really depends on how many different stylesheets you have and how granular and disconnected the styling is
[17:29:49] <FightingFalcon> ok by the way, is it safe to delete all web-kit entries from a css file? they arent necessary?
[17:29:57] <entuland> you never "need" to put them inside of <style> tags
[17:30:32] <entuland> the vendor-prefixed declarations you have to keep depend on the browser support you need in relation to the features you are using
[17:31:00] <entuland> some things may only work prefixed on older versions, some other things may be experimental and require prefixing on newer browsers and so forth
[17:31:16] <FightingFalcon> i see
[17:31:21] <entuland> there is no one-size-fits-all for all the vendor prefixes, it depends on your scenario

[18:30:25] <hassoon> hmw[at]: a game would require a great deal of time and effort
[18:30:30] <hmw[at]> I am not doing it for the money, but I can actually expect to get a little
[18:30:58] <hmw[at]> I wrote one and half operating systems for it already :)
[18:31:20] <hmw[at]> With multi tasking!
[18:32:19] <hassoon> hmw[at]: I hope you get a good result in the end, especially in the form if a new income
[18:32:36] <hassoon> i mean doing that for the sake of fun is not a good motivation imo
[18:32:37] <hmw[at]> The game is going to be a diving simulation, where you lift up various goodies from sunken ships and fight the kraken
[18:33:42] <hassoon> ya sure, that's nice
[18:33:44] <hmw[at]> I find it a lot of fun, because the machine is so simple
[18:35:22] <hmw[at]> The disk drives are actual computers. You can upload software to them. I intend to extend my fractal generator to do multi-processing :)
[18:36:16] <hassoon> is that in yout basement? ahah
[18:36:36] <hmw[at]> It _is_ a basement lol
[18:37:38] <hassoon> you should put that operations room in your CV ahah

[19:08:11] <FlorianBad> I noticed that a simple text content in a flex box seems to ignore `text-align` and that I need to use the flex propriety for that `justify-content`. Does it make sense to also set text-align just in case or it's silly? e.g. `justify-content:center;text-align:center`
[19:42:13] <hassoon> FlorianBad: you might want to place the text element itself inside a flex-item wrapper, and apply the text-align property on the text element (e.g a span containing text), so the text-align takes effect, and justify-content only affects the flex item which is in our case, the wrapper of the span that contains the text
[19:43:03] <FlorianBad> hassoon: yeah ok it makes more sense like that, will do this :)  Thanks
