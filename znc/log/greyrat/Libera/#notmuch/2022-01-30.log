[18:20:12] <bremner> mdt: ooc, what go bindings are you using? I was thinking of dropping the go bindings from the notmuch source
[19:50:44] <mdt> bremner: github.com/zenhack/go.notmuch - i didnt know about the go binding which come with the notmuch source..
[19:50:51] <mdt> let me check
[19:51:34] <bremner> right, that sounds familiar
[19:54:51] <mdt> yes, its quite different from the official aproach, what do you suggest?
[19:55:16] <bremner> mdt: I have no strong opinions, except that I don't want to learn go myself in order to maintain the bindings
[19:56:10] <mdt> bremner: i'm fine with the other and dont miss anything for now
[19:56:23] <bremner> OK, that is useful to know.
[19:58:15] <mdt> it's not gone so i can switch later and maybe maintain it in a  different repo if i need to switch. the maintainer of the other code is currently busy with other stuff too
[20:10:43] <cworth> mdt: We would definitely prefer to have only the most well-supported and actively maintained bindings distributed with notmuch itself.

[20:55:42] <cosimone> hello, i recently started using notmuch for my email and i'm quite pleased with it so far.  i only have one question: is it possible to set a different "real name" for different addresses?
[20:58:10] <mdt> cworth: sure. but as an external project it's fine too, right? i just checked my distribution and found they offer zenhacks but not the official, even the dev package doesnt contain the go code. so i'm fine with or without the bindings in the official repo :)
[21:00:12] <cworth> mdt: Yes. An external project existing is fine. What I'm trying to say is that if that external project is actually the most well-supported and actively maintained bindings, then we could do either or both of the following: 1. Just drop the existing go bindings distributed with notmuch itself, 2. Invite the maintainer of the more well-supported bindings to maintain them within the notmuch repository itself.
[21:01:00] <cworth> And we need active users of the bindings to help us understand the situation, (since the maintainers of the notmuch repository aren't users of these bindings nor experts in Go).
[21:01:29] <cworth> cosimone: Welcome! I'm glad you're using notmuch and finding it useful.
[21:03:01] <cworth> cosimone: First, are you using ntomuch within emacs? Second, your use case is not something I ever needed, so I didn't code up anything for that in notmuch originally. But I also hesitate to definitively state features that notmuch doesn't have, (since a lot of features have been added during the time I haven't been paying as close attention).
[21:04:33] <cosimone> yes, i'm using it within emacs
[21:05:47] <cworth> Cool. That helps as it's the interface several of us here are most familiar with.
[21:06:21] <cosimone> i'm talking about the user.name setting specifically btw

[21:21:46] <cosimone> i see that the emacs frontend provides a notmuch-identities variable, it could be what i want
[21:22:19] <cosimone> after all, what i want is to simply use a different real name based on the sender address i'm using
[21:30:40] <bremner> if that doesn't work out, I think the two most commonly recommended addons are gnus-alias and message-templ
