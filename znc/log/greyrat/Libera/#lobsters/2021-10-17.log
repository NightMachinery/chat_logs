[00:02:45] <gerikson> wow that's the longest humblebrag I've ever read
[00:03:14] <varjag> lol
[00:03:58] <gerikson> 48 hrs/week at work - that's just the baseline
[00:04:15] <gerikson> so, one extra workday per week, no biggie
[00:04:28] <kline> weird that people post themselves making own goals like this
[00:04:31] <gerikson> "yes I am single why do you ask"
[00:05:12] <kline> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137576033-f7fa007c-db94-4b1c-9d9d-05440da118d7.png
[00:05:15] <kline> "Blue is being human"
[00:06:01] <gerikson> "care for 9 cats"
[00:06:03] <gerikson> ...
[00:06:41] <gerikson> at least there's some exercise in the re
[00:06:41] <kline> im going to mark this off topic
[00:06:50] <gerikson> not safe for sanity
[00:06:57] <kline> aside from it being a little bit off topic
[00:07:05] <onicosta[m]> gerikson: Codes while on the threadmill.
[00:07:11] <gerikson> but ofc
[00:07:14] <kline> its actually just really sad and i dont think we should publish/glorify this with karma
[00:10:58] <kline> of course, moral judgements aside, the biggest thing youre going to suffer from here is a lack of roundedness
[00:11:17] <kline> we acknowledge diversity is useful because different experiences bring different ways to thinking and solutions
[00:11:57] <kline> with no other hobbies and very limited social interaction then surely the only domain knowledge they can have is development
[00:12:06] <kline> i think it says a lot that they mostly make tools for development
[00:12:16] <kline> propane and propane accessories
[00:12:20] <gerikson> anyway here's the data on todsacerdoti from Apr this year https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wxf3lCaxVCvti0FgTvsJgseGvrK1Lq4AqrmbCO0F9o/edit?usp=sharing

It's this code here: https://github.com/barneygale/elevate/blob/master/elevate/posix.py#L34-L40 . When I run my program thru that osascript command, all the output comes out at once when the it
[18:26:43] <forestj> exits, instead of the lines being received by the pipe as they are written.   I am asking because I'm not really a Mac developer but I'm trying to make a cross-platform application that supports mac. I know maybe this isn't the best channel to ask, but I know there are probably quite a few knowledgeable mac folks here. Also, if you can think of a
