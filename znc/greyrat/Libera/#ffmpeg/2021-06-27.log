[00:42:22] <x256> Is there any way to get realtime guarantees with h264 similar to vpx -deadline=realtime? Other than just throwing CPUs aon it and selecting a fast-enough preset?
[00:43:16] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[00:44:14] <furq> no
[00:44:36] <furq> the vpx one isn't really guaranteed, the docs refer to it as "soft realtime"

[00:51:30] <x256> Still nice to be able to estimate that you can run a certain number of live-encoding jobs on a given hardware server, independent of stream content. That's a nice feature of vpx, even if it is not perfect.

[21:32:02] <zumba_addict> Hey guys. How do we sync two video recordings where one is 60fps and the to other one is 59.94fps. I noticed at the end of my video, the gopro recording which is at 59.94fps became a little delayed.

[21:34:15] <BtbN> By either occasionally duplicating a frame in the lower fps one, or dropping some in the higher fps one
[21:36:32] <zumba_addict> got it
[21:39:56] <BtbN> basically, just throw an fps filter on one of them, and set it to the fps of the other

[21:58:33] <zumba_addict> thanks for all the tips. I'll try it later
[22:02:43] <zumba_addict> currently reading this - https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#fps-1 Is it different from "-r 60000/1001"?
[22:04:40] *** Joins: toretto (~0xe3b7@45.15.16.60)
[22:05:28] <toretto> Hi, is it possiable to "stream" the mp3 music file as either rtmp or with m3us by specifying a directory where the mp3 file exists? Is it possiable to do that?
[22:06:07] *** Joins: zsoltiv_ (~zsoltiv@fibhost-67-12-35.fibernet.hu)
[22:06:53] <toretto> I find any help online on doing this specific task.
[22:07:02] <toretto> *can't
[22:07:05] <toretto> I can't
[22:09:20] <znf> what are you trying to achieve?
[22:11:14] <toretto> I'll have a directory like `/tmp/music` wher I've *.mp3 files in remote server. I want to stream these files and listen to them on my local maching, I guess I can do that through rtmp or m3u8 or any other real time protocol. But I don't know the exact ffmpeg command which I can use on my remote machine to do stream.
[22:11:36] <toretto> I don't know if that's even possiable, like ffmpeg acting like rtmp server or m3u8.
[22:11:45] <toretto> znf:
[22:12:23] <znf> ok, but why?
[22:12:40] <znf> you can just add the URL of the MP3 file in almost any player out there and it will play
[22:12:46] <znf> you don't need a complicated setup for mp3 streaming
[22:13:15] <znf> and there's dozens of solutions for music playback over the internet
[22:13:15] <toretto> But, streaming is something I want to do.
[22:13:25] <JEEB> icecast is generally often utilized
[22:13:29] <JEEB> which you can then feed with something
[22:13:56] <znf> If you want to do some sort of radio system, then yes, IceCast is what you want
[22:14:11] <toretto> I see. I'll look about icecast.
[22:14:49] <znf> Otherwise, if you want to have your own music library available anywhere for your own needs, you could look at Ampache
[22:15:35] * bittermelons likes icecast!!!
[22:15:37] <znf> MPD is another thing
[22:15:59] <bittermelons> icecast is really simple. easy to start up a gnu screen and have it all running there
[22:16:05] <bittermelons> and ssh to it for debug if necessary
[22:16:21] <bittermelons> i stream .ogg
[22:16:30] <bittermelons> works on most systems (all the good ones anyway;D)
[22:16:32] <znf> you're confusing him
[22:16:41] <bittermelons> znf: sorry, i'll go back to quiet
[22:16:42] <znf> now he's gonna think he needs to convert his music library to ogg
[22:16:45] <znf> :P
[22:16:46] <Neomoon> Hello, I'm trying to troubleshoot an issue I'm having getting 400 bad request errors via a shell script that reads from a delimited file. I created a sample script that demos the error, the issue appears to be something in the way the url is being interpreted by ffmpeg. It only appears to happen with this particular urls not others I have tried
[22:16:47] <bittermelons> but he does
[22:16:51] <bittermelons> mp3 sux ;)
[22:17:10] <bittermelons> i am just making the point that icecast can also handle ogg which makes me :)
[22:18:57] <bittermelons> i personally use ices/icecast combo
[22:19:15] <bittermelons> i often get confused what each one specifically does.. but together they do what i want :D

[22:20:58] <bittermelons> hmm, just found this very straightforward article: https://www.howtoforge.com/linux_webradio_with_icecast2_ices2_p2
[22:21:20] <bittermelons> saves me some typin'!! :)
[22:21:32] <bittermelons> toretto: ^^ lemme know if you have any ???s setting it up
[22:22:35] <bittermelons> i set mine up with a couple of layers... so i have a bash script that i can do something like $mix-in talk-show.ogg 14:20
[22:23:13] <bittermelons> and at 14:20, it'll play talk-show.ogg overriding the current stream.. which will fall back to the music stream when talk-show.ogg ends
[22:23:35] <bittermelons> in the background it just sets up an "at" job
[22:24:30] <toretto> Yeah, I'm setting up icecast.
[22:24:35] <toretto> on my server.
[22:24:55] <bittermelons> it is simple and straightforward.. i like it
[22:25:06] <bittermelons> and you can use mpv or vlc to listen to it easily
[22:25:26] <bittermelons> vlc is on every platform i know anyone on.. so that is most convenient to share with friends
[22:25:53] <bittermelons> toretto: don't forget to port forward if you want to access from a remote site
[22:26:03] <bittermelons> and also check if your installation sets up an init.d job
[22:26:16] <bittermelons> i had issues setting mine up because it kept saying the port was already being used
[22:26:22] <bittermelons> because there was an init job starting ices
[22:26:29] <bittermelons> but... it was using some default config
[22:26:32] <bittermelons> confused me for a good day
[22:27:45] <bittermelons> what i still don't know how to do yet is ... how to live stream with it (aka direct microphone input to icecast)
[22:29:50] <toretto> hmm..I'm not sure how I can setup the mountpoint.
[22:30:10] <toretto> Like, to actually list things from /tmp/music for example
[22:30:23] <bittermelons> lemme look at my config
[22:30:42] <toretto> I'm reading this, https://icecast.org/docs/icecast-trunk/basic_setup/, but not helpful.
[22:31:31] <bittermelons> grr, i am on wrong computer... i think i need ssh keys to get to box with icecast -.-
[22:31:48] <bittermelons> i know on my setup, i was playing things from /mzk/
[22:32:00] <toretto> Yeah, how did you set that up?
[22:32:07] <toretto> Like, to tell icecast to look at /mzk/
[22:32:10] <bittermelons> iirc however, i think i ls'd /mzk/
[22:32:17] <bittermelons> and pointed it to a file of paths
[22:32:29] <bittermelons> ls -r /mzk/ > PLAYLIST
[22:32:34] <bittermelons> and then you point icecast to PLAYLIST
[22:32:40] <bittermelons> iirc, i had to do something janky like that
[22:32:53] <toretto> How do you "point". that's something i'm asking.
[22:33:05] <bittermelons> it is in the config, right lemme re-read
[22:33:15] <bittermelons> (sorry i haven't had my icecast server running in a couple months)

[22:39:33] <bittermelons> i re-read half of https://www.howtoforge.com/linux_webradio_with_icecast2_ices2_p2
[22:39:42] <bittermelons> and i got some of my bearings back..
[22:39:50] <bittermelons> as such, ices is what defines the playlist
[22:40:12] <bittermelons> so icecast (sets up the broadcasting bit) as far as i understand, and ices sets up what is being streamed
[22:40:28] <bittermelons> so in your ices.xml ... you'll have a definition like
[22:41:14] <bittermelons>  <param name="file">/etc/ices2/playlist.txt</param>
[22:41:14] *** Joins: KombuchaKip (~kip@192.252.230.5)
[22:41:37] <bittermelons> znk, you cannot force a "shuffle" as a user/listener.. but you can set "random" in an ices config

[22:42:03] <bittermelons> and a name
[22:42:31] <bittermelons> your ices2 config will have your playlist file defined and will link to a icecast mount point
[22:42:45] <bittermelons> the playlist is a file of full paths
[22:43:26] <bittermelons> iirc you can add to that playlist, and restart it without disconnecting clients
[22:43:48] <bittermelons> this next part might sound overcomplicated, but i have 3 streams layered on top of each other set up
[22:44:00] <bittermelons> stream (a) is the sound of flowing water
[22:44:06] <bittermelons> stream (b) is the main music stream
[22:44:23] <bittermelons> and stream (c) is an overlay for "shows/news interruptions"
[22:44:58] <bittermelons> if the main music stream B is playing.. and i kill the stream to edit the config... it drops back to the sound of flowing water.. and as soon as i restart the B stream.. it jumps back to music
[22:45:05] <bittermelons> and clients stay connected through the process

[22:58:42] <bittermelons>   <param name="file">/root/twiceburntbeans/tbb-list</param>
[22:59:46] <bittermelons> in this case, you'd want to 'ls -r /tmp/music > /root/twiceburntbeans/tbb-list'
[22:59:58] <bittermelons> that'll put paths of all your music in file tbb-list
[23:00:05] <bittermelons> now the next important line of the config is
[23:00:42] <bittermelons>   <mount>/wakestream.ogg</mount>
[23:01:11] <bittermelons> that tells the ices config, which icecast mount point to connect to (the icecast mount point and config information is in its own .xml file)
[23:02:28] <JEEB> (46
