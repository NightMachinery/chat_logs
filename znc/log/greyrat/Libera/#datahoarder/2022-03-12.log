[02:12:52] <xMopx> what's 1:1 mean? i thought wasabi had no egress fees
[02:13:15] <ThePendulum> they have a fair use policy which is what I said, you can download as much per month as you are storing
[02:13:25] <ThePendulum> if you are storing 500GB with them you can download 500GB per month
[02:13:36] <rawktucc> i considered wasabi but their per GB/TB price is too high, and you're locked into some kind of 90 day contract with them I believe
[02:13:39] <xMopx> gotcha

[02:19:54] <vuori> Run some heavy io on it for a while and see if you get more errors
[02:19:56] <kron> haven't had to replace disks in those yet, I would hope they get new drives for the big servers
[02:20:35] <vuori> udma errors sounds more like random bus errors that get resolved with a retry

[02:20:51] <rawktucc> vuori yes they're normally SATA/mobo errors

[07:06:22] <rawktucc> i was doing straight shreds to the drive

[07:11:38] <xMopx> i'm a zfs fanboi
[07:12:13] <xMopx> and from what i can tell, that kind of error does not correlate to data integrity errors the OS level observes 
[07:14:15] <xMopx> there's probably some inefficiency? io commands re-issued? but i dont know of a layer to measure that on
[07:14:19] <rawktucc> nope, it's something in the hardware stack
[07:14:24] <rawktucc> i will be using zfs with this, don't worry

[07:14:57] <rawktucc> but i can't trust ZFS if the underlying layer of HDD Controller OR Sata cable OR sata port OR sata controller

[07:31:44] <rawktucc> both drives have different product sheets. the ONLY differences I can see are: the "003G" model is not listed as CMR on the spec sheet, whereas the 001J is.
[07:32:08] <rawktucc> The 0003G model has "Random Read/Write 4K QD16 WCD (IOPS)" as 170/440, whereas the 001J is 170/550

[20:42:26] <ThePendulum> that reminds me, I think I stashed some drugs in my PS2's HDD expansion bay and forgot about it for a decade
[20:43:04] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: woof. That definitely aged well lol
[20:43:07] <evilgohan2> :S
[20:43:14] <evilgohan2> (re: the book)
[20:43:21] <ThePendulum> oh I thought the drugs lol, yeah
[20:43:31] <evilgohan2> oh, those likely didn't age well lmao
[20:44:03] <Fiji> unless it was jenkem
[20:44:07] <Fiji> then im sure it fermented great
[20:44:11] <Fiji> itll be like wine at this point
[20:44:36] <ThePendulum> I've had two packs of cheese in one week now that went moldy minutes after I opened them, idk if they were moldy in the packet
[20:44:57] <Fiji> what type of cheese? also how did you re-wrap it after opening?
[20:45:04] <ThePendulum> never had that happen with any cheese, idk what's wrong with this brand, I was already annoyed it comes in a plastic wrap instead of a tray
[20:45:16] <Fiji> your fridge might be due for a cleaning/might want to use some airtight container to see if that helps
[20:45:44] <ThePendulum> hm how long could it survive in a fridge without growing on anything
[20:46:03] <ThePendulum> the fridge itself isn't moldy so it would have to be some loose spores
[20:46:04] <Fiji> depends a lot on the cheese tbh
[20:46:18] <Fiji> softer cheeses will probably grow molds more quickly than harder ones
[20:46:27] <evilgohan2> even in containers, I've seen cheese mold.
[20:46:30] <ThePendulum> idk what to call it in english, young cheese in dutch lol
[20:46:44] <Fiji> of course, all cheese are made of mold, they will mold eventually
[20:46:47] <ThePendulum> I'll see if it happens to the trayed cheese as well
[20:46:53] <evilgohan2> fair point.
[20:46:57] <ThePendulum> is it the same mold though?
[20:47:48] <Fiji> i think most are yeah, except for the really stinky ones
[20:48:06] <evilgohan2> I can't stand Brie
[20:48:43] <Fiji> i hate her too
[20:48:44] <ThePendulum> maybe one day I'm desperate enough to try it and change my mind
[20:48:58] <evilgohan2> lmao
[20:48:58] <Fiji> her acting is OK but she could have a better personality off of movie sets
[20:49:05] <Fiji> lol
