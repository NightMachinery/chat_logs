[00:53:08] <bookworm> no
[00:53:18] <bookworm> but I think there's an issue for it
[00:54:22] <bl1nk> There's #4107
[00:54:26] <bl1nk> (does that work?)
[00:54:31] <bl1nk> No. Here's the link: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4107
[00:55:05] <eliocamp> Yeah, that's the issue. I was reading it. I guess I could remove the add network button with css to make it harder. 
[00:55:44] <eliocamp> Although if a user is stupid enough to remove the default network then they would be unable to return. 
[00:56:38] <bookworm> button and you need to disable the command
[00:57:13] <eliocamp> How would I disable the command (without editing the source)
[00:57:19] <bookworm> you can't
[00:58:02] <eliocamp> CSS it is then ðŸ˜…
[00:58:17] <bookworm> JavaScript isn't that bad
[00:58:45] <eliocamp> I'd like to avoid having to compile from soruce and all that. 
[00:58:51] <bookworm> why?
[00:59:29] <bookworm> yarn install && NODE_ENV=production yarn build
[00:59:32] <bookworm> done
[00:59:50] <eliocamp> Because it's a hassle. We want to eventually have easy-to-follow instructions on how to set up everything and compiling can be hard and it's OS-dependent... it can be a bit too much. 
[01:00:03] <bookworm> it's really not
[01:00:28] <bookworm> the JavaScript stuff is always the same, sqlite can be a problem but not on any modern arch
[01:00:51] <bookworm> libvips on the other hand is, but using our prebuilt binary doesn't make that any easier
[01:01:01] <bookworm> you still pull in both C deps at install time
[01:02:42] <eliocamp> Still. It's a whole n'other big step that we'd like to avoid if we can. 
[01:03:18] <bookworm> up to you
[01:03:31] <bookworm> CSS comes non default too though
[01:03:43] <eliocamp> Yep ðŸ˜Š
[01:03:46] <bookworm> which is exactly the same hassle ;)
[01:04:30] <eliocamp> Nah, it's just adding a file, or changing a few lines. It doesn't require recompiling everything, it doesn't come with having to maintain a patch, etc.. 
[01:04:57] <eliocamp> I just did it in a couple of seconds and can disable it even faster. 
[01:04:59] <bookworm> where do you wanna put it then?
[01:05:05] <bookworm> don't you add a theme?
[01:05:19] <eliocamp> For know, on the custom stylesheet.
[01:05:37] <bookworm> do you expect people to mess with custom CSS? Every single one?
[01:05:56] <eliocamp> Nope. I put it on a "template" user which is then used to create each new user. 
[01:06:04] <bookworm> mkey
[01:06:22] <eliocamp> It's not great if we make changes on the fly, but for our usecase, it works. 
[01:06:43] <bookworm> if it works for you why not
[01:08:53] <eliocamp> We could edit /etc/thelounge/packages/node_modules/thelounge/public/css/style.css, right?
[01:09:22] <eliocamp> Ah, no.. it's minified hell. 
[01:09:30] <bookworm> by then you would be much better off with a proper theme
[01:09:40] <eliocamp> Yep. probably
[01:09:43] <bookworm> that's binary patching, the worst sort
[01:10:02] <bookworm> patch it at the source or use the infrastructure provoded (better)
[01:10:19] <eliocamp> Yep, you're right. 
[01:10:26] <eliocamp> A proper theme woudl be better. 
[01:10:30] <bookworm> yes

[01:10:40] <bookworm> then set *that* as default
[01:11:14] <eliocamp> Right. Or even the only option. Can we delete the default themes?
[01:11:24] <bookworm> depending on how strict you wanna be you'd again need to patch the source so that people can't change it... depends on if it's for convenience or security
[01:11:59] <bookworm> I think so, never tried. As long as it's not the default it should not matter
[01:12:39] <eliocamp> I'd report back :)

[03:41:02] <JoeMerit> wow
[03:41:10] <JoeMerit> lets hear it
[03:41:49] <thelounge37> Compared to ZNC, when I close or leave the channel I lose all the previous chat on that said channel. I don't know if this a normal behaviour of The Lounge
