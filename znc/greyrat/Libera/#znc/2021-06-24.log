[03:14:34] <independent56> how do i add channels to my network? i have no idea how to begin logging channels.
[03:15:28] <independent56> and how do i join one?
[03:15:46] <MetaNova> /join #channel
[03:16:30] <MetaNova> or, if you want to do it the hard way, you can log into webadmin -> Your Settings -> Edit network -> Add channel -> specify the channel name, be sure "Enabled" is checked, save

[13:14:25] <dimi1947> I have a win10 machine...do I need to set up a server on it to use znc?
[13:14:49] <mrvdv> dimi1947, just get a free znc
[13:14:49] <mrvdv> lol
[13:15:25] <dimi1947> any good tutorial on how to set upt znc on win10?
[13:15:32] <mrvdv> dunno, i run linux
[13:16:07] <dimi1947> I am interested on onfo/help for win
[13:32:39] <DarthGandalf> dimi1947: is it running 24/7?
[13:32:55] <DarthGandalf> if so, there's a windows section on [[Installation]]
[13:32:55] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Installation
[13:34:28] <DarthGandalf> and if it's not, running ZNC on that machine (regardless of OS) wouldn't make much sense
[13:43:12] <dimi1947> my Pc? no I close it at night
[13:44:33] <dimi1947> there is the "disconnection" problem though w irc...
[14:00:28] <Casper> Yeah, installing ZNC on that PC won't do anything then, as it'll be closed when you close your PC.
[14:00:52] <Casper> You need a device (or VPS for example) that'll be on 24/7.
[14:12:55] <dimi1947> so...w a VPC event if I close the PC there will not be a problem
[14:13:09] <dimi1947> ...vps
[14:16:43] <Casper> Yes, a VPS is normally always on, unless you shut it down, heh
[14:20:09] <dimi1947> when close the IRC client does that mean thet disconnection occur  from irc?
[14:24:45] <DarthGandalf> obviously
[14:25:25] <dimi1947> so when closing the cient or closing the PC there is this disconnection problem
[14:25:49] <DarthGandalf> obviously

[14:53:37] <kushal> dimi1947, free vps may not be good for privacy, better find community providers. 
[14:53:55] * mrvdv provides free znc :)
[14:55:59] <DarthGandalf> kushal: why community providers would be any better for privacy than a free vps?
[14:56:03] <DarthGandalf> I'd say it's the reverse
[14:57:08] *** Joins: independent56 (~independe@2.26.38.198)
[14:57:17] <DarthGandalf> dimi1947: I think the lowest tier of ec2 or gcp are free
[14:58:16] <kushal> DarthGandalf, Okay. Let me rephrase, trusted community providers are nice, and I also did not think about a proper but low power vps option when I talked about privacy. 
[14:58:30] <kushal> DarthGandalf, like the ec2 example you gave. 
[14:58:40] <dimi1947> url?
[14:59:33] <DarthGandalf> How do you know what community providers are trusted?
[15:00:00] <kushal> DarthGandalf, in my case I know them personally :)
[15:00:09] <kushal> and I run their code on my computer :)
[15:00:13] <DarthGandalf> That's a different story
[15:00:41] <kushal> DarthGandalf, true, and I am saying what i wrote at first is wrong in that point of view, you are correct. 
[15:02:01] <dimi1947> where can i find such a provider..in the web i mean...do you have any link?
[15:02:18] <mrvdv> dimi1947, have you setup a znc before on linux ?

[15:28:04] <Casper> mrvdv, the provider's website you added doesn't even resolve.
[15:28:15] <mrvdv> because they gave up 
[15:28:38] *** Parts: mrvdv (~Michael@liveshells.net) ()
[15:28:44] <Casper> Lmao...
[15:29:09] <Casper> So they gave up within 1 or 2 days? Yeah, looks like you'd really want such a host. :^) 
[15:30:06] <Casper> MetaNova, what was the reason for removing it again btw? :p
[15:31:08] <peterandre> you mean lunar ?
[15:31:10] <Casper> Eh, removing it, not again.
[15:31:12] <Casper> peterandre, no.
[15:31:19] <peterandre> ok
[15:31:23] <Casper> freeshellz, the one mrvdv added.
[15:31:27] <peterandre> ah
[15:31:32] <peterandre> i see
[15:34:12] <r00tobo> yeah lunar is not in the providers list 
[15:34:14] <dimi1947> r00tobo:these are znc providers...no VPS correct?
[15:34:25] <r00tobo> dimi1947: Correct
[15:34:33] <Casper> It's a list of ZNC providers, but some of them also provide shells :p
[15:34:43] <Casper> But if you only provide shells and no ZNC, you're not on that list. :D
[15:34:57] <Casper> r00tobo, yeah, I don't accept new account requests at the moment, so I removed myself from the list.
[15:36:14] <r00tobo> I don't consider shells as a vps
[15:37:22] <r00tobo> get yourself a vps and we can help you from there
[15:38:27] <Casper> You can happily install ZNC on a shell though. :^) 
[15:38:39] <r00tobo> yes but I don't like it
[15:39:16] <Casper> Then you should change your text to: "get yourself a vps and I can help you from there" as "we" (this channel in general) can most likely still help with that :p
[15:39:51] <r00tobo> I did say "we can help you" 
[15:40:05] <r00tobo> read it again Casper :p
[15:40:36] <Casper> Yeah, but your requirement in there is for them to get a VPS, which is not a requirement for the 'we' part. :D
[15:40:52] <dimi1947> r00tobo:just to see if i understood correctly...in order to use one of these providers do i have to set up a server on my machine?
[15:41:10] <Casper> dimi1947, a VPS is mostly not in your own house.
[15:41:15] <r00tobo> typically yeah Casper :P
[15:41:30] <Casper> The purpose is to get a (virtual) server at a provider and you install ZNC on there.
[15:41:42] <dimi1947> oh...
[15:42:09] <Casper> Or a raspberry pi at your home for example, as long as it's -something- that you normally don't power off and keep connected to the internet at all times.
[15:42:13] <r00tobo> dimi1947: these providers are providing you a pre-installed znc ready to go while a VPS like Casper said you control the machine itself and most likely these providers use a VPS of some sort
[15:42:29] <dimi1947> so these are VPS providers in which I can install znc..is that coreect?
[15:42:35] <Casper> Correct.
[15:42:42] <dimi1947> hmm
[15:42:53] <Casper> But a VPS is mostly not free.
[15:43:26] <Casper> Whereas there are ZNC providers out that do provide a ZNC account for free, where you won't need to install/admin it yourself.
[15:44:53] <dimi1947> name some
[15:45:05] <r00tobo> dimi1947: https://wiki.znc.in/Providers
[15:45:12] <Casper> ^ exactly.
[15:46:02] <r00tobo> dimi1947: also read the warning in the top 
[15:46:04] <r00tobo> :P
[15:46:56] <r00tobo> at*
[15:52:02] <dimi1947> r00tobo:but these providers if understood correctly use VPS?
[15:52:53] <r00tobo> most likely yeah but they are in control not you, they setup a znc and give you an account 
[15:53:43] <dimi1947> it is clear
[15:54:20] <dimi1947> but as I see in the warning...there is not guarantee of everything
[15:54:27] <dimi1947> ...nothing i meant
[15:55:18] <r00tobo> exactly, you can relies upon a certain provider but that provider may disappear tomorrow or something
[15:55:28] <dimi1947> i see
[15:56:38] <dimi1947> so two options: I pay for a VPS and set up znc myselg AND create an account in one of these providers but reliability is an issue
[15:57:47] <dimi1947> OR
[15:58:03] *** Quits: independent56 (~independe@2.26.38.198) (Remote host closed the connection)

[16:01:17] <r00tobo> dimi1947: no, not "and create an account in one of these providers" if you setup znc yourself you can create your own account in your own vps no need to sign for a znc provider because you are the provider :p
[16:01:38] <dimi1947> I corrected it
[16:01:54] <r00tobo> sorry didn't pay enough attention 
[16:01:54] <dimi1947> see above
[16:02:04] <dimi1947> no prob
[16:02:11] <r00tobo> yeah that's correct
[16:02:31] <dimi1947> as I see the first option is better
[16:02:40] <dimi1947> if the latter is unreliable
[16:02:57] <dimi1947> the latter comes w risk
[16:06:46] <r00tobo> yeah and we can walk you through everything we are here to help
[16:08:25] <dimi1947> usually what are the costs for a vps?
[16:10:42] *** Quits: independent56 (~independe@2.26.38.198) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:11:06] <r00tobo> if you really want low end vps it can be as low as 1.25$/y
[16:13:19] <Khaytsus> If google hasn't started charging for a public IP my google cloud machine would have been perpetually free :/
[16:14:09] <r00tobo> that's sad, don't they offer IPv6 ?
[16:15:25] <Khaytsus> AFAIK doesn't matter, plus I don't have ipv6 here at home..  and tunnels are slow, useless crap
[16:15:27] <jiggawatt> they charge for that too r00tobo
[16:15:40] <r00tobo> they charge for ipv6 :/
[16:16:07] <Khaytsus> I've never found any documentation saying any different
[16:17:07] <r00tobo> I know certain vps provider that offers /48 prefix
[16:17:24] <r00tobo> and it comes basically for free
[16:17:53] <Khaytsus> But is it worth it
[16:18:08] <Khaytsus> I've seen a few "free" vps that aren't worth 5 minutes of time
[16:19:21] <r00tobo> I was saying if google forces you to pay for the ipv4 then maybe ipv6 only vps could do the trick to be a completely free but turned out it's charged 
[16:20:07] <r00tobo> the one I mentioned isn't free it's around 2$/m
[16:20:10] <Khaytsus> I know someone who bought a vps for $100 "for life"  not sure who, or what, but it was such trash he had to move.  
[16:20:33] <r00tobo> dimi1947: I correct myself it's 1.25$/m not /y lol
[16:20:53] <r00tobo> that's around 15$/y

[16:29:42] <Casper> Khaytsus, tunnelbroker is fine tbh.
[16:31:31] <jiggawatt> yeah get a Ramnode for $15/year
[16:31:42] <jiggawatt> 128 MB OpenVZ container
[16:31:44] <jiggawatt> perfect for IRC
[16:32:01] <jiggawatt> IPv4 and IPv6 included at no extra charge
[16:32:51] <jiggawatt> r00tobo is the /48 routed from that provider?
[16:33:08] <jiggawatt> many providers give you on-link addresses only, though you can pick any from the entire /48
[16:33:46] *** kour1er is now known as kour1er_
[16:33:48] <Casper> RamNode doesn't provide a /48 unfortunately at least.
[16:34:27] <Casper> I don't think you can easily get a /48 for 'cheap VPS' providers.

[17:36:47] <dimi1947> as I see it...I wll find a VPS and then ask some assistance from here for setting ZNC
[17:36:56] *** Joins: dbasinge (~dbasinge@ubuntu/member/dbasinge)
[17:41:44] <jiggawatt> that's a good idea
[17:42:49] <jiggawatt> Casper you can get a /48 from low end providers but it won't be routed
[17:43:02] <jiggawatt> I think Linode is the only host that provides a routed /64
[17:43:20] <jiggawatt> GCP doens't even give you a routed anything

[17:55:18] <jiggawatt> oh right
[17:55:23] <jiggawatt> good enough for IRC
[18:00:13] <r00tobo> dimi1947: we are giving you the cheapest so far you wouldn't find cheaper and reliable than this I think
[18:02:59] <r00tobo> you could find NAT vpses that are also cheap but unreliable
[18:03:31] <dimi1947> do you offer VPS too...I am confused
[18:04:13] <r00tobo> I don't operate a vps business but I can suggest a few reliable options
[18:05:10] <dimi1947> suggest me than...
[18:07:46] <jiggawatt> https://www.ramnode.com
[18:07:55] <jiggawatt> cheapest quality provider
[18:11:20] <r00tobo> jiggawatt: I think the cheapest openvz plan is locked to the us region 
[18:11:59] <jiggawatt> yeah they don't offer it in NL anymore
[18:12:03] <jiggawatt> because of IPv4
[18:15:11] <r00tobo> didn't know that
[18:17:30] <r00tobo> dimi1947: if you don't mind ordering a us located vps because of latency go ahead
[18:18:52] <dimi1947> I wll make a search first...I learned enough today about znc/vps..you helped....
[18:19:20] <dimi1947> I did not quite follow the above comment...can you rephrase
[18:20:50] <r00tobo> dimi1947: it's good to order a vps that is located near your location if you are in the eu for example order a vps that is located in eu if you are in NA order a vps that is located in NA e.g CA or US based

[18:28:40] <Casper> If you're looking for a cheap VPS in the Netherlands; https://www.pcextreme.com/cloud-servers/starter €1.24/mo (ex VAT)
[18:29:03] <Casper> Includes 1 IPv4 and 1 IPv6 iirc (maybe more, but I thought just 1)

[22:41:07] <MetaNova> Casper: malicious website redirect
[22:41:46] <MetaNova> their https link did not work, but an http version did, which redirected to a site blocked by one of my safe browsing extensions
[22:42:44] <MetaNova> if you don't have a website, don't link to anything, or link to a pastebin or something, not some sketchy redirect
[22:44:04] <Casper> MetaNova, thanks for clarification. The things he said made me expect as much haha.
[22:44:13] <Casper> At least the fact that it's malicious, heh.
[22:48:48] <MetaNova> I can't confirm with absolute certainty that it was malicious -- but, suspect enough that my browser blocked it? yes
[22:51:15] <MetaNova> their approach to addressing why it was removed didn't help matters, either https://wiki.znc.in/index.php?title=Template%3AProviders%2Ftable&type=revision&diff=2825&oldid=2824
[22:54:12] <Khaytsus> It's also interesting that the site disappeared soon after
[22:57:57] <Casper> Yeah, their addressing was what got me too. Specially his "× mrvdv × because they gave up " was funny.
[22:58:52] <MetaNova> there are plenty of other free ZNC providers who are not listed at the Providers page (either intentionally or through indifference)
[22:59:20] <MetaNova> DarkZNC, RavaZNC, and um
[22:59:25] <MetaNova> another I can't think of the name of
[22:59:30] <MetaNova> (and probably more)
[22:59:52] * MetaNova shrugs
[23:00:02] <MetaNova> the "they gave up" thing seems like backpedaling
[23:00:11] <Casper> Registration date of the domain btw: Creation Date: 2021-06-05T09:50:06Z 
[23:00:22] <MetaNova> just over two weeks ago
[23:00:43] <MetaNova> well, okay, almost three weeks
[23:02:16] <Casper> Wew.. :p Either way, good that it's not on there anymore as they ran away anyways, heh.
