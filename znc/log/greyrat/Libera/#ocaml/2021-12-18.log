[00:38:06] <companion_cube> that's 100% bullshit

[00:53:05] <Leonidas> Corbin: well, that post doesn't factuate anything, really. "the way Haskell or Ocaml are built" means nothing
[00:53:37] <Leonidas> Like, does the poster dislike the build system? the fact that they are both written in C? Who knows!
[00:53:37] <companion_cube> you could replace by "python and php" and it'd be at least as accurate
[00:53:59] <Leonidas> > They both have a single relevant implementation
[00:54:15] <Leonidas> Which is true for nearly all languages.
[00:54:37] <companion_cube> > OCaml is moving too fast
[00:54:40] <companion_cube> lolllllolol
[00:54:47] <Leonidas> Notable exceptions include Java (which has... like two relevant implementations) and maybe C/C++?
[00:55:01] <Leonidas> Yes, the moving too fast thing is ridiculous

[00:55:45] <Leonidas> This might be the possibly best substatiated claim but this is getting better.

[07:07:25] <d_bot> <mk-fg> Fwiw, never had a problem with ocaml docs, but there's got to be a bias wrt commenting on it here, as presumably all people who had an issue parsing those will give up on trying to learn ocaml and likely won't be in any related channels :)
[07:08:51] <Corbin>  I would put up Ruby as an example which blubifies OCaml here; that is, OCaml sits between Python and Ruby in terms of reference documentation quality.
[07:10:19] <Corbin> There's two features in particular. First, most Ruby packages are documented using centralized tools, so that if you can ask your package manager to quickly install the gem from a central repo, then you can also ask the central repo to show you the gem's docs.
[07:10:51] <Corbin> Second, many short methods are directly inlined into the docs; you can just click a method if you want to see how it's implemented.
[07:11:08] <Corbin> https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/thor is an example popular package, for those who haven't clicked around Ruby docs before.
[07:18:10] <d_bot> <mk-fg> Yeah, quick check source indeed looks like a cool feature
[07:20:30] <d_bot> <mk-fg> Didn't actually get to use much docs on third-party ocaml stuff myself, as mostly use it to implement small system/helper tools for which stdlib works perfectly fine, and integrating with various libs is trivial via a bit of C glue
[07:21:07] *** Quits: hackinghorn (~hackingho@user/hackinghorn) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[07:24:44] <d_bot> <mk-fg> One feature that I probably like the most in ocaml and python docs, is that they're easy to download and then use by putting/replacing module name in the URL directly via custom search in the browser to open the ref page for that module instantly
[07:25:28] <d_bot> <mk-fg> E.g. "ml Hashtbl" will just open `file:///home/.../Desktop/docs/ocaml-X.Y/libref/Hashtbl.html`
[07:25:53] <companion_cube> Corbin: I'd say OCaml is on par with your second point
[07:26:01] <companion_cube> one keypress tells me a function's signature and doc
[07:26:08] <companion_cube> `gd` jumps to its definition
[07:33:54] <Corbin> companion_cube: We're comparing Web docs to Web docs. That's a cool editor feature though.

[20:10:34] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Oy, FP _can_ be complicated (category theory), but for day to day work, I find that lots of my functions tend to melt away to half to a quarter of their initial size when I work in OCaml vs any of my previous, imperative languages.  The expressiveness quickly becomes very apparent even just as a rookie fooling around with the Stdlib.
[20:14:22] <d_bot> <Kakadu> Thanks, it looks like it is a right reference indeed
[20:15:30] <Corbin> VPhantom: Funny you say that; my category-theory-based language's expressions are much smaller than OCaml's; lots of lambdas and name-plumbing just melts away~
[20:19:18] <d_bot> <let Butanium = raise Not_found;;> what is this language ?
[20:19:33] <Corbin> https://esolangs.org/wiki/Cammy
[20:20:17] <d_bot> <mbacarella> The specific success case if you want more color is that they tried to rewrite a hodgepodge of Excel spreadsheets (aka their core prop trading infrastructure) into real trading systems with proper software engineering and the traders found the  C# code that was supposed to replace it very difficult to follow because of mutability and inheritance.

[20:26:28] <d_bot> <mbacarella> I think a big contributor to their culture of thinking about risk this way was that one of the partners worked on a nuclear submarine. Which is obviously an environment where reality doesn't care about how confident you feel about your system.
