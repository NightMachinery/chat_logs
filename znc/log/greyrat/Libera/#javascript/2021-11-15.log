[00:40:08] <AndreYuhai> In Javascript class can I set some attribute in constructor and also have a setter at the same time so I can invoke another function when the value changes for example? So I want to have a default in constructor and also have a setter so that it just invokes some other function when the value changes.
[00:40:35] <AndreYuhai> That gives me infinite loop I think :D But maybe there's another way

[00:45:05] <Fault> AndreYuhai: I think you need to use a separate “shadow” variable to accomplish what you want if I’m understanding correctly. Honestly hard to say without seeing code, plus I never use setter functions because I don’t like magic: if you want something to happen as you set a variable, just make it an explicit function and call that. Magic is

[00:55:38] <Fault> That’s not how you use those at all. If you just want to return this.foo, you don’t need the getter function. They’re designed for dynamic return values. If you really want to do that, you need a separate variable like this._foo to be the concrete storage and avoid the looping.

[01:13:17] <FlorianBad> hmm I see, so the target is always the actual element clicked?
[01:13:36] <FlorianBad> I mean the first one
[01:14:24] <kalen> there's only 1 event. whether you set that event on a child at the bottom or a parent at the top with a million children is irrelevant. it's still just 1 event. setting the event on parent/wrapper just means that the event will ALSO fire if you happen to click on a child element. but it still only fires once. it's always just 1 event

[08:43:22] <systemfault> lantech19446: As much as there are cooks who specialize into cutting apples... grating cheese...
[08:43:41] <wroathe> systemfault: Good analogy
[08:43:50] <wroathe> systemfault: I was thinking of something snarkier than that
[08:44:31] <systemfault> Yes, eventually... you see some highly skilled chef who can basically do origami with fruits but it's far from being typical cooking
[08:44:47] <lantech19446> I'm still learning how programming works and it seems like there would be some segmentation on huge projects like facebook or google
[08:45:07] <systemfault> Similar with programming, it may happen that you need an actual mathematician to write a very complex algorithm... but these cases are not the norm
[08:45:34] <lantech19446> ok
[08:45:58] <wroathe> lantech19446: A function is one of the most fundamental building blocks for a program, and basically every programmer will author them. Algorithms, on the other hand, may require a specialist depending on the domain
[08:46:40] <wroathe> lantech19446: For example, the scientists who wrote the code to stitch together that image of a black hole from all of the black hole images from telescopes all over the planet

[13:54:25] <stenno> i would have guessed scoping issues but hard to tell without code
[13:54:33] <pluri> but whenever the event is triggered, `use(i)` takes the `i` of the last iteration

[14:11:37] <pluri> how do I change it so that it displays the `i` at which I attached the event?
[14:12:32] <stenno> you start at 0 but you want to start at 1
[14:12:39] <stenno> but this is how i would do it:
[14:13:16] <thykka> pluri, simplest solution, use `let` instead of `var`
[14:14:20] <stenno> document.querySelectorAll('.button').forEach((element, index) => element.addEventListener('click', () => $('.output').text(index)));

[16:31:20] <austincheney> OhTheCode, have a code that generates a select list and then returns that select list element.  I don't know if I would call that a factory function.
[16:32:13] <austincheney> function whatever(some_input) {const sel=document.createElement("select"); return sel;};  mySelect=whatever(options);
[16:32:30] <austincheney> just a function
[16:32:32] <austincheney> nothing fancy
[16:33:08] <OhTheCode> no, it works like google.com search bar, there are events that are with it, when you type in letters, it looks them up and only shows the options available after each letter u type, like google.com search bar
[16:33:25] <austincheney> autocomplete
[16:33:37] <OhTheCode> it's not a drop down,
[16:33:37] <thykka> someone is about to learn tries :]
[16:34:01] <stenno> implementing autocomplete is a nice task for a beginner
[16:34:10] <austincheney> agreed
[16:34:53] * austincheney has fallen in love with bodhi linux for VMs
[16:35:08] <OhTheCode> it's sort of like a drop down but it's not, it can be a country list but not a drop down but like a drop down, if i type in "land" it shows all the countries with "land" in it like New Zealand

[16:35:55] <OhTheCode> so it has a render() function and events linked to it
[16:35:59] <austincheney> its always going to be a drop down for accessibility compliance, but you can make it look and behave however you want
[16:36:16] <austincheney> I recommend starting simple and worrying about the fancy stuff later
[16:36:43] <OhTheCode> no, no, this is what i want, i can do the simple stuff that u mentioned

[16:38:27] <austincheney> typically the way this works is that there is only an event associated with the select element, the change event.  That change event will result in updates the list or changes elsewhere in the page.  You can do other things with focus, blur, and so forth of the individual options but those things aren't necessary for autocomplete
[16:39:10] <austincheney> that and a text input that has an event for keydown
[16:39:29] <austincheney> the keydown fires on each character press and updates the options in the select list

[16:44:35] <OhTheCode> so they have a few events for this select list..... if i want to create 5 of these fields on a screen, i wonder how i would structure this code
[16:45:12] <OhTheCode> it could be any component that has events binding to it and i guess a render() function that draws it on the screen
[16:45:45] <OhTheCode> i have this as a sort of skeleton of my code - https://dpaste.com/58QVDGKL8

[16:51:37] <austincheney> the options of the select list are dynamically created in response to the data returns from the keydown event of the text field.  Since you are dynamically creating those options you can at the very same time assign event handlers to them custom to their content

[17:31:49] <thykka> maybe worth noting that it may belong to multiple classes.. For example, an <input> is both HTMLInputElement and a HTMLElement

[20:06:12] <lantech19446> I keep seeing people in my webdev groups on facebook posting code that uses var to initialize a variable, I thought var was java not javascript I've only learned to use let when is it appropriate to use var instead?
[20:08:42] <iffraff> Hi, so, on the server, I have several levels of logic that handle a request,  the action ( or resolver ), the domain validation, the database interaction and sometimes something lateral.  My question is what is a good/the right pattern for error handling?  should every function return void, and if there is an exception catch it in the top level ( action or resolver )? have a try catch in every function, rethrow with context and catch in the resolver/
[20:08:43] <iffraff> action?  have a try catch in every function and return a resut/errors continuation response?

[20:31:10] <iffraff> Or I guess there could be failures that should be reported such as validation error, so perhaps all function should be returning a "continuation" and if any function has a validation error it would set errors on the continuation and success to false.

[22:19:54] <Decker> no boiler plate in the final; at the cost that you're not instnatiating the base base class but one above it
[22:20:01] <Decker> that's exactly what you wanted.
[22:20:26] <ljharb> zzz: you'd do `new Set(str)` and `new Set(chars)` and then you'd intersect the two sets, and see if the size matched the charSet size.
[22:20:26] <Decker> just s/constructor/init/ and bob's yer uncle

[23:46:39] <Decker> https://www.npmjs.com/package/sack-gui would be the other thing I"d try to do a game in - but it's not much more than canvas; hardly a game engine itself.  It's really just C ; but that has hookd from JS to C

[23:46:44] <earendel> usually the guys developing an engine dont make the game. but sounds like you want to make the engine for the game. shit like shaders are on its a biz. they use own languages.

[23:47:24] <Decker> cairo?
[23:47:25] <earendel> don't know wasn't there even wegl unreal engine?
[23:47:29] <Donitz> is it cairo?
[23:47:34] <Decker> *shrug*
[23:47:38] <Donitz> cairo is slow as hell afaik
[23:47:44] <Donitz> canvas is super optimized
[23:47:44] <earendel> i think just customizing that one could be a liftime work
[23:47:46] <Decker> so's canvas :)

[23:51:48] <earendel> canvas has so far two 'contexts' webgl and 2d .. i's basically an element in the DOM like others, but with the possibility to draw the bitmaps within its cascading pos and range (updated) pixel by pixel
[23:52:16] <earendel> i bet you could implement it to use mariolang contexts.
[23:53:05] <earendel> well. ok. but for that you would have to kill some wc3 staff and also a few zillas.
[23:53:06] <earendel> :p

[23:54:46] <earendel> tell me.
[23:54:46] <Donitz> it's not really pixel by pixel
[23:54:54] <Donitz> I'm fairly certain it's done just the same as with webgl
[23:55:01] <Donitz> 2d just being a kind of wrapper
[23:55:08] <Donitz> with a lot of render targets I bet
[23:55:34] <Donitz> it's way too fast to not be running everything on the GPU always
[23:55:39] <earendel> the canvas is a bitmap..but the presentation within the page is also css ruled.
[23:55:52] <earendel> you can set the color in all its pixel.
[23:56:03] <Donitz> yes, but that's done through a specific API
[23:56:10] <Donitz> and generally isn't neccesary
[23:56:11] <Decker> the css side just sets the scaling between bitmap and display
[23:56:27] <earendel> are you stupid donitz?
[23:56:33] <Donitz> are you?
[23:56:38] <Donitz> sorry, I got defense when attacked
[23:56:41] <Donitz> defensive*
[23:57:06] <earendel> ok. i didn't attack u hope. maybe i was.
[23:57:16] <earendel> i wanted to see blood. you are right.
[23:57:21] <earendel> lol. excuse me.
[23:57:26] <Donitz> anyway, canvas is extremely optimized, and doesn't work on a per-pixel level
[23:57:34] <Donitz> it users shaders just like everything else
[23:57:37] <Donitz> uses*
[23:57:40] *** Quits: sebastorama (~sebastora@190.83.56.68) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:57:50] <Decker> it can work on a per-pixel level
[23:57:51] <Donitz> I don't know how, but it must
[23:58:01] <Donitz> it can, but you request that specifically through getBitmapData
[23:58:03] <Decker> and it doesn't really use shaders - bit blitting is pretty fast though for image copy operations
[23:58:05] <Donitz> it's a special operation
[23:58:16] <Donitz> umm... getPixelData
[23:58:16] <Decker> right - and putdata
[23:58:22] <Decker> something like that
[23:58:24] *** Joins: sebastorama (~sebastora@190.83.56.68)
[23:58:40] <Decker> but ya that's too slow to get good framerates
[23:58:46] <Decker>  you dn't want to do the bit pushing yourself :)
[23:58:50] <Decker> best if you get the GPU to do it for you
[23:58:51] <Donitz> naw, it's not slow at all
[23:58:53] <Donitz> it's extremely fast
