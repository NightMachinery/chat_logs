[21:06:23] <ario> has spent 6 weeks so far on it with not to show
[21:06:25] <ario> im confused
[21:06:30] <ario> nothing*
[21:08:38] <ario> team size is like 12 now?
[21:08:42] <belak> Microservices are one of those things which solve a specific problem and have their place, but unless you've scaled to the point where you absolutely need to scale services separately, the engineering effort is generally better spent elsewhere...
[21:09:22] <belak> Similar to sharding a database - it has its place, but you're generally better off throwing more money at the hardware to get bigger and bigger DB machines until you can't any more
[21:09:30] <c355e3b> I feel like we have a decent service split at work
[21:09:52] <technomancy> one of the grizzled devs at work is making a decent case that while microservices aren't solving any technical problems, they can help with a situation where you have a lot of inexperienced devs because it limits the damage any one person can do
[21:09:56] <c355e3b> Everything is in a single large repo with a shared SDK between the services
[21:10:18] <c355e3b> So we can scale components up and down, but the cost to change any part is still very low
[21:10:25] <c355e3b> (UNLESS YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMER CODE)
[21:10:29] <belak> technomancy: that's a fair argument, but you still need someone who knows exactly what they're doing to maintain the glue between them, and keep N services running and scaled properly
[21:11:21] <belak> Also quite a few places in their initial implementation of microservices end up doing what I've called nano-services... which are essentially just a single endpoint extracted to a service... which generally points to design issues
[21:12:02] <c355e3b> I feel like if you want nano-services you should run Erlang for everything
[21:12:03] <belak> c355e3b: that sounds like a pretty decent trade-off
[21:12:08] <belak> Hah
[21:12:14] <c355e3b> It is, mostly
[21:12:45] <c355e3b> running it locally gets to be a bit annoying but that's every app IMO
[21:13:16] <technomancy> I'm just getting used to this idea that you need to design your system based on the expertise of the team, not based on what makes the most sense from a technical perspective
[21:13:44] <c355e3b> Have you never worked in operations technomancy? That's learning number one.
[21:13:53] <technomancy> never have, haha
[21:13:55] <belak> Yeah, our python mono-repo and macro-service are getting a bit unmaintainable, so we're trying to find decent ways to make it more usable
[21:14:02] <c355e3b> The amount of shit I've had to do to *keep* people from shooting themselves in the foot is astounding.
[21:14:17] <technomancy> I've previously always worked on teams where nearly everyone is roughly as experienced as I am
[21:14:20] <c355e3b> belak, do you want some advice on that?
[21:14:32] <belak> c355e3b: if you're offering, that would be awesome
[21:14:46] <c355e3b> buy a better monitoring vendor and dump as much as you can into it.
[21:14:55] <belak> We have some ideas, but I'd love to not make the same mistakes that other people already have
[21:15:16] <c355e3b> If you don't have an inventory and  an understand of what is going on, you are never going to be able to extract or fix anything
[21:15:46] <belak> I assume you mean monitoring of running services?
[21:15:54] <c355e3b> Yeah
[21:16:01] <belak> Hahaha, well, that's fair. We are a monitoring vendor.
[21:16:10] <c355e3b> Oh fun, which one?
[21:16:16] <belak> DataDog

[21:22:52] <belak> That's a good thing to note
[21:23:08] <c355e3b> If *they* are willing to accept the burden and the hassle on on-boarding then let them take it
[21:23:13] <c355e3b> but if they can't don't push
[21:23:24] <c355e3b> leads to really shit quality on both sides

[21:23:42] <indigo> At our last sprint planning: "hey, this high priority project is slipping the deadline a bit, did you want us to add more people to it?"
[21:23:47] <indigo> Hell. No.

[21:24:29] <technomancy> indigo: no I don't mean physically crashing the same process; I mean more like conceptually crossing concerns that need to remain separate.
[21:25:17] <indigo> I dunno... I've had some pretty crossed conceptual concerns in microservices land
[21:25:46] <indigo> Like someone factoring out an email template service from the monolith
[21:25:55] <indigo> Not sending email, just generating templates
[21:26:08] <indigo> And then the monolith sends the actual email
[21:26:21] <technomancy> sure; it can happen but it's dramatically easier to spot in review
[21:26:44] <c355e3b> indigo: it sounds like you've worked at an e-commerce compnay!
[21:28:03] <indigo> To each their own; I'm of the opinion that if your devs can't do separation of concerns in a monolith properly, I don't see how adding the complexity of microservices would help... other than make it really hard to refactor the code into a proper architecture
[21:28:23] <indigo> c355e3b: I've worked at TWO ;-)

[21:36:43] <belak> I may be missing something, but how does that apply to the payments ruling?

[22:09:06] <riv> oh i see
[22:09:12] <imode> I don't think that's on topic either. re: apple v. epic.
[22:09:30] <imode> could make the argument though.

[22:12:10] <easeout> i posted it unsure; it's just a big deal is all. wouldn't mind it removed.
[22:13:21] <easeout> there's a law tag, and it's law about platforms? does feel pretty borderline though.
[22:14:36] <pushcx> I removed that one, nothing about that case has been relevant.

[22:25:37] <pushcx> I think at best it'll be a couple years, at worst indefinitely. I think it's more likely than not that regulators/law enforcement take a more active role, right now it looks an awful lot like pre-Glass-Steagall investing.
[22:26:46] <c355e3b> Ok
[22:27:07] <pushcx> Maybe that'll be more laws, maybe that'll be reaffirmations of existing securities law (which has some very broad definitions of "security"!). Probably won't be tossing pump-and-dumpers in jail, it'll just become an offshore industry like advance fee frauds, phone scams, etc.

[22:57:51] <belak> All of the solutions people have been posting come across as really passive-aggressive or even downright aggressive... I get that the posts are annoying, but that seems a bit too far.

[23:38:43] <banna> I'd love to see more people advocating for the computational requirements of blockchain rather than screaming about how "tech" it is
[23:39:16] <banna> "hey, this stuff is like... a lot!" rather than being all franks red hot about it
[23:39:30] <banna> (i.e. "I put that sh*t in everything" effect)
[23:39:32] <riv> why?
[23:39:42] <riv> wouldn't it be better not to read about any of that stuff at all?
[23:40:08] <c355e3b> In concept, there are some very niche areas in which a blockchain like system could be effective
[23:40:39] <c355e3b> in practice, the community around it makes it hard to deal with open and honestly
[23:40:56] <banna> riv: not for people who can use their brains, but for those people who want to proliferate that technology
[23:41:49] <banna> in practice, the amount of energy it takes to scale any implementation seems a bit wasteful imo
[23:42:41] <banna> unless the actual application of "the blockchain" (in its many nuances) actually solves a problem.
[23:43:18] <banna> I'm not going to lie, I do feel like most modern digital tech is very wasteful.
[23:44:30] <banna> I hope one point in the future we'll all look back at the devices produced in our era and deem it irresponsible to delegate those devices to those functions
[23:44:45] <banna> I may be a minority in that.
[23:44:55] <technomancy> what do you mean the future?
[23:45:02] <banna> Oh right, lol, we're all doomed
[23:45:25] <technomancy> no I mean like ... why not do that now?
