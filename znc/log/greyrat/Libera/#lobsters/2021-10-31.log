[03:37:43] <epilys> haha no, because I've been running the test suite over and over with my custom vfs already
[03:38:10] <dimadima> i'm not sure what you mean
[03:38:26] <epilys> I wrote a custom VFS for sqlite

[13:01:57] <jj5> I have this annoying problem in firefox, if I click File -> Save As it takes 20 or 30 seconds to show the file dialog
[13:02:11] <jj5> I ran firefox in strace to try and find the problem:
[13:02:31] <jj5> 20:27:56 read(159, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 16) = 8
[13:02:32] <jj5> 20:27:56 poll([{fd=159, events=POLLIN}], 1, 25000) = 0 (Timeout)
[13:02:33] <jj5> 20:28:21 write(159, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8) = 8
[13:02:59] <jj5> it says poll timeout then 25 seconds later it writes
[13:03:43] *** Joins: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud)
[13:03:44] <jj5> I suspect the timeout is on an NFS mount maybe? how can I figure out which file fd=159 is..?
[13:04:05] <riv> could you run lsof -i to see the open file?
[13:04:16] <jj5> yes, let me do that

[13:04:59] <jj5> okay let me know what you would like to see
[13:08:00] <riv> i guess it's lsof -d 159

[13:22:36] <jj5> af: okay, good to know, thanks
[13:22:59] <jj5> what is [eventfd] .. ?
[13:23:27] <af> that's a syscall
[13:23:29] <riv> it's an IPC mechanism
[13:23:40] <riv> what af said is more correct :)
[13:24:26] <af> jj5: to identify what 159 is, you can check the strace log itself to show which syscall returned that file descriptor in the first case
[13:25:34] <af> another option would be to check the output of file on /proc/<pid from strace>/fd/159
[13:25:47] <af> but I think it's best to check the strace log
[13:26:02] <jj5> af: just grep the strace log?
[13:26:07] <af> sure

[13:28:30] <jj5> https://www.jj5.net/file/2021-10-31-205648/firefox.103.strace.txt
[13:29:25] <jj5> the number from this latest test is 103 not 159
[13:30:05] <af> > 20:40:28 eventfd2(0, EFD_CLOEXEC|EFD_NONBLOCK) = 103
[13:30:54] <af> so it's just an eventfd descriptor and you'd have to dig into the code to see what it's expecting
[13:31:25] <af> it could technically be related to the filesystem, but it could just as well be something entirely different
[13:31:56] <jj5> is it reasonable to assume that whatever it is it's a timeout problem?
[13:32:30] <af> yes
[13:32:58] <jj5> I wonder what it is... :P
[13:33:05] <af> did you run strace with -f?
[13:33:20] <jj5> no, just with -t, should I go through the process again?
[13:34:06] <af> Yes, try with -f
[13:34:17] <jj5> okay, gimme a tick
[13:34:24] <af> in addition to -t, not instead of it
[13:34:42] <jj5> okay
[13:39:03] <jj5> this time there is so much log activity that by the time the log has finished the timeout has happened. so there is no noticeable delay in the strace log.
[13:39:27] <jj5> the log is 96MB now, compared with 17MB without -f
[13:40:17] <jj5> because there was no noticeable delay I wasn't sure which file descriptor to use.
[13:42:00] <af> you can try grepping for 25000, Timeout, etc.
[13:42:46] <af> what you're looking for is the log from the other process which was supposed to reply on the event fd
[13:42:49] <jj5> 25000 is the timeout?
[13:42:55] <af> i.e., the other side of the ipc
[13:42:57] <af> yes
[13:43:08] <jj5> [pid 3021523] 21:08:30 poll([{fd=119, events=POLLIN}], 1, 25000 <unfinished ...>
[13:44:17] <af> find the closest eventfd call just before that which returned 119 (the line will end with " = 119")
[13:44:38] <dsc_> also use `-s 1512` @ strace
[13:44:47] <dsc_> so it does not truncate strings
[13:45:00] <dsc_> (execve arguments, etc)
[13:46:00] <jj5> like this? `strace -t -f -s 1512 firefox 2>&1 > firefox.strace`
[13:46:18] <dsc_> sure
[13:46:52] <dsc_> i usually pipe it to `| grep --line-buffered`
[13:47:05] <dsc_> and remove stuff I don't like with grep's -vE flag
[13:47:32] <dsc_> (or just grep on the relevant syscalls directly)
[13:48:08] <jj5> hmm, that command above seems to be outputting content to my tty... but I've redirected to file, what's up with that?
[13:48:57] <dsc_> I think -o is for outputting to a file?
[13:49:16] <dsc_> your command should work though
