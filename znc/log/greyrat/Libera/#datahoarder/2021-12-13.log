[00:15:37] <ThePendulum> if a microsd card is 'opened read-only', gparted can't format it, badblocks can't test it, and hdparm can't switch the read mode, it's probably dead right?
[00:17:02] <x10> yep
[00:18:33] <ThePendulum> or do these things have a microscopic switch on the side lol
[00:18:46] <ThePendulum> ordered some new ones anyway
[00:19:18] <ThePendulum> was really tempted to get a 64GB or 128GB SD card but I don't know what I'd use it for. got 2x 32GB and a 128GB flash drive
[00:19:59] <ThePendulum> I figured by the time I actually need an SD card like that, those sizes have probably gotten cheaper
[00:21:51] <ThePendulum> the fact 1TB microSD exists is just insane
[00:22:04] <ThePendulum> wonder how laughable that sounds 10 years from now

[01:06:18] <rawktucc> until it dies :)
[01:07:07] <ThePendulum> I did briefly consider buying another adapter and just ditching flash drives altogether
[01:07:19] <rawktucc> microSD is so slow though for writes
[01:07:25] <rawktucc> a USB 3.0 drive will always beat that
[01:07:25] <ThePendulum> but I don't think it'd be any good for the stuff I use flash drives for
[01:07:28] <rawktucc> but maybe not...
[01:08:26] <rawktucc> https://tilde.team/~rawktucc/blog/usb-review-adata-uv35032gb.html
[01:08:36] <rawktucc> i have one pending for a Kingston drive, garbage writes on that thing
[01:12:17] <ThePendulum> I had a nice 128GB sandisk but I accidentally broke it in half :(
[01:35:11] <rawktucc> So I'm not sure how I didn't consider this but Amazon Deep Glacier Archive is 0.00099c/GB, which is more like 0.001c/GB. Every request is billed, metadata is stored in S3 under normal conditions, and it costs a fat fucking load to pull it out of cold storage 
[01:35:30] <rawktucc> im moving to scaleway which is 0.002c/GB, EUR though. no metadata or push/pull costs

[17:14:59] <EtherMan> NeoThermic: By having your life in order. Stable life, means no jumping from work to work. No work jumping generally means you stay in one place. And thus, don't generally move outside of major life changes, such as getting kids, at which point you move for that and then you live there until the kids move out at the very least. The vast majority of people move 3-4 times throughout their entire life.
[17:15:01] <ThePendulum> I mean we never had a reason to move, only now I do because I'm getting a bit old to be living with my parents
[17:15:19] <NeoThermic> EtherMan, you've made so many assumptions in that first paragraph :P
[17:15:43] <NeoThermic> ThePendulum, yep, RAF brat
[17:15:44] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_ø<​ Q​UACK!
[17:15:46] <NeoThermic> ,bang
[17:15:46] <unfinity> NeoThermic you shot a duck in 2.498 seconds! You have killed 363 ducks in #datahoarder.
[17:15:55] <ThePendulum> I expect to be renting an apartment for a few years until I can buy a house, and I'll try to find one I wouldn't mind dying in
[17:16:04] <ThePendulum> so either one that's good enough to grow old in, or one with rotten flooring
[17:16:11] <NeoThermic> hah
[17:16:20] <EtherMan> Not a single assumption there at all. I specifically said it's the general stuff and not applicable to all people in all situations.
[17:16:49] <ThePendulum> but yeah if your or your parent's job is on the move
[17:16:50] <NeoThermic> thing is, people change houses for MANY reasons, not just moving jobs
[17:17:32] <EtherMan> ThePendulum: Don't get a garden in that case lol. Your garden will kill you when you get old, quite literally >_<
[17:17:42] <ThePendulum> we almost moved at one point many years ago, but we decided to renovate instead
[17:17:46] <ThePendulum> heh, how so?
[17:17:49] <NeoThermic> that makes the garden a perfect thing to get!
[17:18:17] <NeoThermic> also from experience, get a garden if you can, flats are nice but the lack of ability to just go chill outside without being in public is underrated
[17:18:19] <EtherMan> NeoThermic: I didn't say they don't. But that is generally the reason why people KEEP changing home, over and over and over...
[17:18:36] <ThePendulum> we've never had a garden, only a small terrace sort of cornor. my grandfather had a great garden that he always used to work in
[17:20:35] <ThePendulum> there's a photo on street view of him working in his front garden
[17:21:36] <EtherMan> ThePendulum: The amount of work you have to put in to a garden, is simply not an amount of work you're actually able to keep up with once you get old. Like I'm just 50, but I hit my limit several years ago. Ofc, many will be able to keep going longer, that all depends on how healthy lifestyle you have, but even for the most well trained, it is back breaking work and you WILL get injured from it, and the older you get, the more dangerous any 
[17:21:36] <EtherMan> injury becomes.
[17:22:54] <ThePendulum> yeah it will have to be a passion you maintain
[17:22:59] <NeoThermic> on the flip side, logical people replace fussy/difficult to upkeep plants with ones that are low maintenance, or ones that an expert can deal with 
[17:23:08] <NeoThermic> trees and vines are easy to care for without back-breaking work
[17:23:41] <x10> i did my garden so it's maybe half a day of work each season, i hate gardening
[17:23:46] <ThePendulum> my grandfather was well into his 80s, he got a gardener the last few months but doing his garden was everything to him, I wish he'd still be around but I'm glad he didn't have to sit indoors for years not being able to work out
[17:23:58] <NeoThermic> also good are seasonal ones that grow/flower in spring/summer, and then wilt and dormant for autumn/winter
[17:24:56] <NeoThermic> x10, exactly. Make the garden as difficult to maintain as you'd be bothered with. :D
[17:25:22] <x10> yeah i've had family sell their house when they retired just because they couldn't keep the garden going
[17:25:36] <x10> so when i bought mine one of the first things i did was make it super low effort
[17:26:01] <ThePendulum> my dad got some ivy to go over some beams he put across our terrace. they've gone all over the place, lol
[17:26:27] <x10> oh fuck ivy
[17:26:52] <x10> i had a 40m fence covered with that shit, was taking over the garden when i bought the place
[17:27:14] <x10> had a guy come in with a crane to just pull fence+ivy out in one go
[17:27:19] <EtherMan> x10: That would not even be enough to be legal around here. You have a legal minimum requirement of state your garden has to be in. You can't as an example ignore cutting your grass. It's not so strong as to legal how long it can be but it can't look untidy or unmaintained... So that's like an hour or two every week for half of the year just in that...
[17:27:37] <ThePendulum> what, including your backyard?
[17:27:40] <x10> yep
[17:27:42] <EtherMan> Yes
[17:28:11] <ThePendulum> over here that's only the case for rentals, and I suppose front yards
[17:28:27] <x10> garden is closed off, nobody got anything to say about mine but me
[17:28:44] <x10> otoh i don't even have grass anymore, fuck that effort
[17:28:47] <EtherMan> Here it's anything viewable from the outside. Which is everywhere because you're not actually allowed to use fenses that cut of sight from outside.
[17:29:36] <ThePendulum> the local chinese restaurant has had a jungle backyard for years over here, and it was facing the street, it's not as bad as it was but it's still not exactly great. pretty sure the most we can do is ask nicely
[17:30:36] <ThePendulum> hah I was checking street view for it and there's someone reporting something to the police https://www.google.com/maps/@50.9419233,5.9234712,3a,59.7y,231.76h,76.04t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sq1pJZXyXWw6G8SaGs_r4Og!2e0!7i16384!8i8192
[17:30:58] <EtherMan> Yea here, the county gets involved in that stuff and you will be required to clean it up, or you get evicted and your house forcibly sold off on auction.
[17:32:14] <ThePendulum> here's that garden, it used to be completely overgrown https://i.imgur.com/CExrhYK.png
[17:32:22] <ThePendulum> I wonder if that swingset is still there, bit of a landmark lol
[17:32:33] <EtherMan> Probably relating to that car halfway up the curb, with the trailer halfway in the street
[17:32:45] <ThePendulum> been there in that state for at least 2 decades, surprised it rusted to that exact state but never fell apart completely
[17:32:46] <joepie91> overgrown gardens are Good, Actually
[17:33:23] <NeoThermic> in the UK, outside of rare scenarios, it's basically "whatever you want to do with the garden, as long as you're not an environmental/fire risk"
[17:33:28] <ThePendulum> joepie91: we don't all sneak up on people with binoculars
[17:33:37] <joepie91> ThePendulum: for biodiversity I mean
[17:34:06] <joepie91> a neat garden is terrible for actual, y'know, life :p
[17:35:05] <EtherMan> joepie91: They're good in the right areas. And we have specific areas that are left untouched for that very reason. In gardens however it attracts rodents and other wildlife, which is not good at all to have among houses. Hence why it's not allowed to have your gardens in a state that attracts it.
[17:35:42] *** Quits: neverfindme (~hayden@158.123.160.43) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:35:45] <ThePendulum> ah I guess that makes sense, I thought it was just an aesthetic thing
[17:36:00] <joepie91> attracting wildlife is a good thing, not a bad thing :p
[17:36:06] *** Joins: neverfindme (~hayden@158.123.160.43)
[17:36:07] <joepie91> (with some specific exceptions)
[17:36:13] <EtherMan> Or at least, that's ONE of the reasons you must maintain the garden. There's several more, such as impacting value on neighboring houses and such.
[17:36:22] <joepie91> oh I know the 'reasons'
[17:36:26] <joepie91> I think they're horseshit
[17:36:27] <ThePendulum> rats and deer probably become problematic quickly
[17:36:33] <ThePendulum> wild cats killing birds
[17:36:50] <joepie91> 'wild cats' are the least of your problems tbh
[17:36:59] <joepie91> try domestic cats
[17:37:28] <EtherMan> Domestic cats, being treated by owner as a wild cat... Most annoying shit I've ever come across.
[17:37:41] <EtherMan> In terms of just pure annoyance I means.
[17:38:07] <ThePendulum> I wonder when the street view car is going to come by again... our street is from 2009
[17:38:23] <ThePendulum> there's a shirt in my window I haven't had for a decade
