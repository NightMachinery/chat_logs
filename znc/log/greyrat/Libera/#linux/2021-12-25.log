[00:16:40] <jensen> ok, seems they are not entirely equivalent: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1616694#p1616694. Will probably be fine. I was just curious how can someone can determine the max optimization one can achieve for 2 CPUs such that it is still optimized for both. Without needing to do benchmarks which is overkill and not feasible. These optimizations are not likely to produce noticeable
[00:16:42] <jensen> differences, but if you're building packages anyway (e.g. from the AUR or adding patches)

[01:09:52] <mlu> on my currnet laptop, I have two wifi interfaces and two ethernet interfaces: I only use just one wifi and one of the ethernet interfaces :)
[01:09:53] <Raito_Bezarius> well such a screen _would be_ a USB-C dock most likely
[01:10:17] <mlu> but on the other hand, a few clicks inside NetworkManager is ususally sufficient

[01:10:47] <Raito_Bezarius> jokes aside
[01:10:58] <Raito_Bezarius> Dagmar, so you have an idea regarding the driver detection stuff?
[01:11:00] <Dagmar> Keep in mind also that proxmox is solving a different set of problems there
[01:11:12] <mlu> also, was my choice to complicate things up by playing with fancy 5Gbit USB adapters and comparing wifi adapters
[01:11:13] <Raito_Bezarius> that was a gentle joke @ proxmox mostly
[01:11:15] <rascul> i think this is where it's defined   https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.11/source/include/uapi/linux/if.h#L33
[01:11:19] <Dagmar> Raito_Bezarius: If the driver won't claim the device and nothing else has claimed it, then something wasn't compiled right with the driver
[01:11:23] <Raito_Bezarius> mlu: ha, did you find nice 5Gbps USB adapters?
[01:11:27] <rascul> so i guess it would be 15 characters and a null to make 16

[01:11:50] <Raito_Bezarius> it effectively goes ~ 2.2-2.3Gbps over Internet
[01:11:57] <Raito_Bezarius> (thanks ISP for giving me 5Gbps)
[01:12:06] <mlu> those $20 2.5Gbit adapters are a much better value
[01:12:07] <Dagmar> mlu: Well, in that proxmox screenshot the NIC name is literally getting the MAC address of the NIC appended to it
[01:12:16] <Dagmar> Like the whole damn MAC address.
[01:12:27] <Raito_Bezarius> mlu: QNA-UC5G1T?
[01:12:31] <mlu> yeah
[01:12:35] <Dagmar> My thinking is maybe we don't need to see the MAC address that far up the chain
[01:12:39] <mlu> it looks and feels nice until you turn it on, and then it's warm
[01:12:48] <mlu> not opposed :)
[01:12:50] <Raito_Bezarius> not that bad, but does it give 5Gbps?
[01:12:56] <Raito_Bezarius> like iperf3 reports

[01:16:19] <hexnewbie> New proposed device naming: envintel3a67e3
[01:16:24] <Dagmar> But if you know C even a little bit you can go dork with the driver source and throw in a bunch of printk statements so it'll write crap to dmesg as it initializes
[01:16:28] <Raito_Bezarius> mlu: in terms of options/etc or ?
[01:16:42] <Raito_Bezarius> actually, the nice thing is I feel very comfortable to hack the kernel to add some stuff
[01:16:50] <mlu> i.e. your raspberry pi ain't gonna saturate 5gbit, but my laptop communicating with a threadripper machine /w a 10gbit interface: worked quite nicely
[01:17:02] <Raito_Bezarius> My laziness though does not to set up some QEMU kerneldev env
[01:17:04] <rbox> hexnewbie: well you can name your interface whatever you want
[01:17:07] <Raito_Bezarius> and passthrough the device
[01:17:08] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: I don't see anything in there about whether not it's plenum or non-plenum cable, and what about the people who care if it's cat5, cat6, or merely cat5e cable?
[01:17:11] <Raito_Bezarius> so I can test quickly

[01:18:30] <Raito_Bezarius> Dagmar: e.g. replacing the 2.5Gbps adapter with smth else?
[01:18:42] <ThiefMaster> tirnanog: not really a problem, just ugly. and i just booted the rescue system and after stopping it mdadm tells me the devices are busy when trying to reassemble it with the new name...
[01:18:45] <Raito_Bezarius> I am not against, but the fun thing is I want to use it on my laptop and take it around, etc
[01:18:46] <Dagmar> Maybe not so much with 2.5G/5G NICs but for anything that costs under $50 if it doesn't work for me out of the box I generally bin it
[01:18:59] <Raito_Bezarius> multigig seems to be a harsh world
[01:19:03] <Raito_Bezarius> harsher than 10/25/40Gbps

[01:19:16] <Raito_Bezarius> well the quirk is really minimal atm

[01:38:44] <mlu> Google funds Mozilla, but Mozilla is "independent"
[01:38:52] <Woodzy> yeh
[01:39:05] <Woodzy> they get money for being google the default search engine
[01:39:05] <mlu> and you basically have two real search engines out there: Google and Bing
[01:39:07] <roofy> midori: error while loading shared libraries: libsoup-gnome-2.4.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[01:39:11] <mlu> the rest just resell results
[01:39:15] <xx> mozilla uses that money for purposes that go against the interests of the users

[01:39:30] <mlu> right: Mozilla is required to use its budget
[01:39:43] <roofy> what the hell is libsoup?
[01:39:47] <mlu> so they are actively incentivized to waste money
[01:39:50] <johnjaye> according to wikipedia Blink which is the engine used in chrome is a fork of Webkit which is used in safari which was forked from KHTML which was used in Konqeror

[03:13:21] <shcv[m]> I'm curious; how do file systems on SSDs manage their root block, given that the SSD is supposed to do write leveling? That is, I read (at least in intro OS material) that file systems usually have a root block at position 0 acting as the entry point to the FS... but if SSDs need to balance writes, that root block will need to also move around, no?

[10:40:50] <Blondie101010> hmmm, lets take a nice deep breath
[10:41:03] <euouae> If I'm on a LiveCD, compilation will be slower right? Is it reasonable to build a kernel and load it in a USB for when I install gentoo?
[10:41:27] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:41:37] <sheep> the livecd should have about the same compiler speed if you cofigure things right
[10:41:47] <Blondie101010> what will be the slowest to build is IO
[10:41:54] <euouae> IO?
[10:42:03] <ayecee> euouae: even if it is slower, it's not going to be, like, twice as long
[10:42:09] <Blondie101010> building the kernel requires a huge amount of IO

[10:42:19] <Blondie101010> much more than that

[12:12:24] <chiselfuse> when say, i'm talking about the compiler in an article

[17:52:17] <mrfb> not my words, I'm a happy gnome user
[17:52:29] <mrfb> and glad for the work that gnome devs do
[17:52:39] <MrElendig> ironic considering that gnome is the only de which have professional ui designers working on it basically
[17:52:50] <mrfb> but as I see it, we "linux" users can't see beyond of our "fanboyism"
[17:53:12] <rustytaco> tbh the current trends of UX/UI design are dumb anyways. Does anyone actually want huge clunky window decorations and bloated buttons? I like fitting as much as possible on the screen while still being pleasant to look at.. i dont need 128px title bars and 40px window borders
[17:53:15] <THE_GFR> mrfb: me too, and I like gnome better than any other WM I have seen
[17:53:17] <mrfb> MrElendig: how many of those designers worked on a agency, or other industry product beyond linux?

[20:03:54] <jensen> how about a way to see files on external drives without them attached? I started with saving tree output before unmounting the drives and grepping it, but not having incremental search is annoying. Now I'm using https://github.com/cboxdoerfer/fsearch which is great but I can't update the index of the local disks without also updating the index of those drives, which aren't attached so will be lost

[23:30:10] <hexnewbie> quartz: Not lag per se, but Plasma can decie to consume 400% CPU randomly that would cause everything to lag; with Debian 11, now it's suddenly taking a second to change my volume too, but I'm too tired of troubleshooting things, so I'm just living with it

[23:36:51] <hexnewbie> rendar: That's an option. But it's a very rare thing for one to need.
[23:37:02] <jim> well the whole ntfs driver is a series of guesses
[23:37:04] <rascul> rendar what is this for?
[23:37:31] <rendar> rascul, ZFS, i want to specify a ZFS pool, and i don't want to pass /dev/sda /dev/sdb and so on, since they are inconsistent
[23:37:44] <rendar> i want to create symbolic links to disk0, disk1 and so on

[23:37:59] <hexnewbie> Paragon claimed that this ntfs3 driver is a clean rewrite (not the thing they are selling), there have been a lot of gnarly issues in the mailing list, *and* folks here have been saying bad things about the ntfs3 driver (or the sold one)
[23:38:06] <rendar> mrfb, there is a better option?
[23:38:28] <mrfb> let me re-read so I understand the problem
[23:38:35] <hexnewbie> So I'd say it's early to use it, unless you plan to beta test it with the health of your data
[23:38:46] <rendar> mrfb, with /dev/disk/by-id i have long paths, full of numbers, instead with a symbolic link i have path/disk0, very clean and short

[23:44:15] <rendar> merry xmas
[23:44:28] <rendar> ZFS won't partition the disk, it will create a zpool with disks devices
[23:44:46] <hexnewbie> rendar: Yes: “For pools to be portable, you must give the zpool command whole disks, not just partitions, so that ZFS can label the disks with portable EFI labels.  Otherwise, disk drivers on platforms of different endianness will not recognize the disks.”
[23:45:17] <hexnewbie> rendar: “label” means create a partition table and partitions
