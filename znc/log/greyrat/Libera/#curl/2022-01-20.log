[14:43:17] <GodEater> offtopic question - but I'm hoping someone here might know the answer - back in the good old days before we had the systemd journal, and people used to run logrotate a lot - isn't logrotate supposed to run - do it's job, and then exit immediately?
[14:44:49] <bagder> I would think so too

[14:51:16] <gevaerts> Maybe check open files, current system call (using ps, can't remember the option), strace, ...
[14:51:39] <GodEater> I'm wondering if it may be due to unwise use of a wildcard in my config...

[17:20:42] <icing> bagder: you want to add JSON support with an internal JSON parser or printf things without?
[17:21:56] <bagder> well, this initial thought is just to help creating json request bodies and not do anything for responses. I think just adding custom code for it
[17:22:24] <bagder> but this is early thinking
[17:22:56] <bagder> sort of feeling people's minds on this
[17:23:18] * icing is reading and thinking...
[17:29:23] *** Quits: spare (~ek6xmklph@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:29:48] <icing> I think interpreting JSON response bodies via jq is fine and there is nothing to gain by letting curl do it. The input part, I am not so sure. 'jo' offers slightly different and more options and the multiple -jp do not look very attractive to me... hmmm...
[17:30:23] <bagder> yeps, those are fair arguments
[17:31:22] *** Joins: spare (~ek6xmklph@user/spareproject)
[17:34:31] <icing> a valid use case seems: jo param=x | curl --json - url
[17:35:29] <icing> or curl --json $(jo param=x) url
[17:37:32] <icing> another thing would be to have JSON templates and replace curl params in it before sending. 
[17:43:42] <icing> This could be done by piping things through 'jq', like in: curl --jq @request.json --jp x=1 --jp name=bagder url

[17:59:38] <icing> is there a curl option that checks all params but does not execute the request?
[18:00:11] <bagder> no there isn't
[18:00:41] <icing> or the other way around: i'd like to check if '--tslv1.3' is understood, but have no site to send something to
[18:01:43] <bagder> use a non-existing url and verify that you get error code 6 back =)
[18:03:18] <gevaerts> Maybe the traditional --dry-run would be useful
[18:03:34] <bagder> yeah, it has been asked for before
[18:03:45] <icing> could not resolve host, ok. might work IF THE HOST does not resolve FROM SOME REASON! ^^
[18:03:49] <Piru> the classic problem is that many options depend on the server actually responding
[18:04:23] <bagder> --dry-run probably need a fake connect/socket or something
[18:04:24] <Piru> so --dry-run wouldn't be able to check much in many cases
[18:04:30] <bagder> yeah
[18:04:40] <bagder> it's hard to make it really useful

[18:05:51] <Piru> also often getting things to work requires use of a mock server dumping the full request. nc or socat are commonly used
[18:06:08] <icing> How about listing some  TLS properties on --version?

[19:40:25] <Piru> hahaha
[19:40:31] <Piru> what the heck :>
[19:41:24] <Piru> it'd hope that this is a joke of some kind
[19:41:35] <Piru> but knowing how things are these days...
[19:41:50] <bagder> right, it might be a joke... or not
[19:45:29] <n3k0b1t> bagder: this is 100% serious
[19:46:03] <n3k0b1t> if you haven't learned anything, the crypto community has learned quite well to be a well-executed joke
[19:46:16] <n3k0b1t> well, beyond the technologies, just the community

[19:47:33] <n3k0b1t> there is one named after me :(
[19:49:20] <n3k0b1t> so congratulations, your mistakes are now worth money :)

[19:50:10] <bagder> I don't think that actually implies that they are worth money...
[19:50:34] <bagder> well, for those where some suckers actually pay it shows it
[19:51:10] <bagder> to the extent that is "my mistakes"
[19:51:31] <n3k0b1t> now bugs are worth more!
[19:51:53] <bagder> to those who mint the nfts at least
[19:52:51] <n3k0b1t> yeah
[19:53:09] <n3k0b1t> i don't see any libcurl ones, it looks like they only put "popular" vulnerabilities
[19:53:18] <n3k0b1t> log4j is the most "liked" one (or minted i would assume)

[19:54:25] <bagder> wohoo
[19:54:29] <n3k0b1t> wow
[19:55:05] <Piru> it's in freedom coin, and there's a thing called taxes. nice bonus still though
[19:55:29] <Piru> what's the usd-eur exchange rate anyway these days
[19:55:46] <bagder> I bet it also involves handing in weird and very beurocratic US tax forms =)
[19:56:09] <Piru> nah luckily they had option to select payment via hackerone
[19:56:15] <bagder> ah nice
[19:56:16] <Piru> so the tax form I did before covers it
[19:56:29] <n3k0b1t> 1 USD -> .88 euros
[19:56:37] <Piru> so yeah 4410 € before taxes it seems
[19:57:03] <bagder> first round on Piru then! 
[19:57:05] <bagder> =)
[19:57:23] <Piru> going to buy some champagne to the office I guess. kind of a tradition
[19:57:37] <bagder> a fine tradition I'd say!
