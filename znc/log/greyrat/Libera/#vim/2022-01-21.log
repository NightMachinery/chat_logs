[00:01:28] <nickspoon> It might also be a good idea to double check that the settings you are setting in your .vimrc are not being overridden elsewhere.   :verbose set tabstop? expandtab? softtabstop? shiftwidth?
[00:01:56] <alyssa> Everything as expected (from the pasted .vimrc line)
[00:02:47] <romainl> also, you might want to add tw=80 to that line so that your comments get automatically wrapped as you type

[03:58:33] <causa_sui> the reason I expect this to work at all is that it did once, but now it doesn't, and I don't know what I changed that broke it. ;\

[06:22:29] <nickspoon>  So % is the current filename, %:p becomes the full pathname of the current file, and then :h strips off the filename part so you end up with the directory of the current file.
[06:23:00] <nickspoon> Then they're adding   /file2  on to the end, meaning open "file2" in the same directory as _this_ file
[06:25:20] <ezzieyguywuf> yup I get it

[17:11:16] <habamax> you can't
[17:11:27] <henrik_> Okay.
[17:12:50] <henrik_> Let me revise my idea a bit. I want to make a variation of the * shortcut, the one that searches for the word under the cursor. On my keyboard, * is Shift-apostrophe. So I was thinking Ctrl-*, or Ctrl-Shift-apostrophe would be a good shortcut
[17:12:53] *** Joins: innsmouthrain (~lovev@178.132.75.214)

[17:21:03] <henrik_> stutz: I often use the Rg (ripgrep) plugin (together with fzf) and want to make a good short cut with it, but can't get it to work with the "*" key.
[17:21:22] <henrik_> Nevermind
[17:21:42] <stutz> I know what Rg (ripgrep) is, I use it too w/ vim's :grep command by setting the grepprg
[17:21:52] <henrik_> Okay
[17:22:03] <stutz> then you use rg, get the result in a quickfix and can use :cn and :cp to jump to the next/previous occurance 
[17:22:32] <henrik_> Ok
[17:22:47] <henrik_> Well, what I have is this shortkey definition: nnoremap <C-*> "zyiw:exe "Rg ".@z.""<CR>
[17:22:57] <henrik_> It essentially works, but not with <C-*>
[17:23:17] <stutz> thats great and yet I was just trying to show you the native vim way of doing it.
[17:23:20] <henrik_> What it does is copy the word under cursor to register z, then fire up Rg with that register's contents as search string
[17:23:32] <stutz> but given that you don't need the help with grep I guess that settles it :D

[23:35:31] <Amnesia> question, I'm using vim at the moment with rls, and when requesting the type definition, I'm receiving: Retrieving type definition not supported for filetype 'rust'
[23:35:58] <Amnesia> is there anyone else over here to know what's up, and whether rls really doesn't support it

[23:36:08] <romainl> there is iece of the puzzle missing
[23:36:13] <romainl> an important one
[23:36:34] <romainl> because Vim itself doesn't speak language server

[23:38:20] <Amnesia> ah, sorry for not mentioning the usage of the lsp-client I'm using, I'm using vim-lsp
[23:38:58] <romainl> Vim itself doesn't seem to be involved in any of that
[23:39:43] <Amnesia> Nope, 99% this isn't related to vim itself; but I kinda made the assumption that members from this channel tend to rely on these plugins as well
[23:40:39] <Amnesia> 99% chance*
