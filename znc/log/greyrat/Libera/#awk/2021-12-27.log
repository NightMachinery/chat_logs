[22:56:08] <Thomas25> In a large body of text, I'm grepping for pattern and then printing N lines after that match. From this filtered output, I'd like to get every X-th line. Like, I want to print (1, 5, 7)(1 + N, 5 + N, 7 + N) and so on.
[22:56:26] *** Joins: YaoNai (~YaoNai@user/yaonai)
[22:56:40] <Thomas25> i.e. I want to extract some lines from each "page" (N lines)
[23:00:52] <Thomas25> looks like this does it -> `awk 'NR%8==0||NR%9==0'` but there's a problem if line number is repeated in the N, i.e. i << N
[23:00:58] <Thomas25> then I also get lines that i don't want
[23:04:28] <yeti> play a bit with this?   >>>    seq 1000 | awk -vpagelen=100 -vlinesofpage='1:5:7' 'BEGIN{split(linesofpage,lines,":")}{if(NR%pagelen in lines) print NR}'
[23:05:07] <yeti> still has a glitch
[23:05:09] <yeti> moooment
[23:05:20] <Thomas25> it has a page feature? jeez
[23:05:28] <Thomas25> that didn't run on mac's awk
[23:05:40] <e36freak> no? they're just variables he assigned
[23:05:57] <nmz1> add a var, if v is true, it already printed, put var in the first line set to 0
[23:06:05] <yeti> the array needs to be reversed....  not looking at the keys...
[23:06:23] <nmz1> bah
[23:06:40] <yeti> need the values as keys... 
[23:06:45] <Thomas25> e36freak ah, i'm too high i got excited haha
[23:06:50] <nmz1> maybe mac awk doesn't have -v ?
[23:06:58] <Thomas25> it doesn't it seems
[23:07:09] <Thomas25> maybe i just need to write a little script for this
[23:07:16] <nmz1> you are
[23:07:18] <nmz1> its in awk
[23:07:24] <Thomas25> lol, right
[23:07:38] <yeti> https://dilbert.com/strip/1995-06-24
[23:07:40] <yeti> :-Þ
[23:09:45] <yeti>  seq 1000 | awk 'BEGIN{lines[1]=lines[3]=lines[5]=1}{if(NR%100 in lines) print NR}'
[23:10:52] <Thomas25> ahh that's very clever
[23:13:14] <yeti> slooowly converges to readable
[23:14:51] <yeti> NR%100 in lines{print}   # diabolic laughter
[23:16:29] <Thomas25> of course, you print NR
[23:16:36] <Thomas25> the output has nothing to do with seq
[23:16:46] <Thomas25> i was confused why it also outputs numbers on my input text lol
[23:16:52] <Thomas25> than i figured to replace it with print;
[23:18:07] <Thomas25> lol, this is going to save me sooo much time 
[23:18:08] <Thomas25> thanks
[23:22:14] <nmz1> values as keys:    c=1+split(linesofpage,b,":"); while(--c) lines[a[c]]++
[23:22:21] <nmz1> seq 1000 | awk 'BEGIN{pagelen=100; linesofpage="1:5:7"; c=1+split(linesofpage,b,":"); while(--c) lines[a[c]]++ } NR%pagelen in lines'
[23:22:51] <nmz1> oops
[23:23:13] <nmz1> seq 1000 | awk 'BEGIN{pagelen=100; linesofpage="1:5:7"; c=1+split(linesofpage,a,":"); while(--c) lines[a[c]]++ } NR%pagelen in lines'
[23:24:03] <yeti> felt too greedy to me to use 2 arrays....  I'm an oldtimer of the "we know every byte with all prenames"-era
[23:24:04] <Thomas25> that's a bit harder to read for me thoguh
[23:24:21] <nmz1> mmm
[23:24:21] <Thomas25> hmm and can we make these lines print int the same line, i.e. join them with ;
[23:24:23] <nmz1> FINE
[23:24:28] <Thomas25> lol
[23:24:30] <nmz1> gmatch it is then
[23:33:04] <Thomas25> actually, if i could make print; to trim the input line, i could make it work with modulus
[23:33:23] <Thomas25> i.e. i'd print all lines except the last one trimmed
[23:33:30] <Thomas25> then they'd be on the same line
[23:38:39] <nmz1> yeti: this only uses a single variable and array    seq 1000 | awk 'BEGIN{pagelen=100; s="1:5:7"; while ( match( s=substr(s,1+RSTART+RLENGTH), /[^:]+/) ) lines[substr(s,RSTART,RLENGTH)]++ } NR%pagelen in lines'
[23:39:23] <yeti> \o/
[23:41:20] <yeti> and now we recode that for an arduino...   >;-)
[23:41:35] <nmz1> ?
[23:41:47] <yeti> just nonsense
[23:42:40] <yeti> I was playing with microcontroller stuff and just thought to use one as coprocessor to do this...
[23:42:59] <yeti> but more as a joke
[23:43:24] <yeti> serial in... filter in µC... serial out
[23:47:16] <nmz1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:48:01] <nmz1> Thomas25: this is why I don't even help anymore, I just ask, example input, example output.
[23:48:19] <Thomas25> hey what's goin on
[23:48:51] <Thomas25> have i destroyed your last hopes for kindness?
[23:51:33] <nmz1> filter1 | awk 'x {print l}; {x=1;l=$0} END {print l_howeveryoulike}' # this prints everything but the last line, you use END to print however you'd like
[23:52:25] <nmz1> though if you mess with the input
[23:53:07] <Thomas25> this is getting to complex, so i'll write a little typescript for this
[23:53:12] <nmz1> :S
[23:53:12] <Thomas25> don't know what i'm gonna end up needing
[23:53:14] <Thomas25> hehehe
[23:53:37] <nmz1> whats complex about it?, just keep using pipes | | | | till you uget what you want
[23:53:40] <Thomas25> thank you though. you're most welcome for the thought excersize as well..
[23:54:13] <nmz1> welp, whatever you're comfortable with
[23:54:44] <Thomas25> sure! merry christmas!
