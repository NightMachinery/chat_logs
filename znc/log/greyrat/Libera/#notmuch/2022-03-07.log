[11:34:18] <gwn> hi notmuch users! I've been trying to debug an issue for 2 hours now. I read all the relevant documentation but simply could not achieve what I want. I came to you as a last resort, I feel extremely frustrated.What I want to do is to simply get the threads that don't have a specific tag. Query example: "not tag:replied". The problem is: The query successfully filters the threads whose only tag is "replied". But it is not filtering the threads which

[12:27:58] <gwn> I read all the relevant documentation but simply could not achieve what I want
[12:28:05] <gwn> I came to you as a last resort, I feel extremely frustrated
[12:28:13] <gwn> What I want to do is to simply get the threads that don't have a specific tag
[12:28:22] <gwn> query example: "not tag:replied"
[12:28:41] <gwn> The problem is: The query successfully filters the threads whose only tag is "replied"
[12:28:51] <gwn> But it is not filtering the threads which have other tags beside "replied": it is returning threads with tags like "replied sent" or "replied attachment" etc
[12:29:04] <gwn> This is not what I expect. I tried everything I could think of including regex searches. To no avail
[12:29:12] <gwn> I'm beginning to think that something may be wrong with my configuration or enviroment
[12:29:19] <gwn> This certainly couldn't be the expected behavior, right?
