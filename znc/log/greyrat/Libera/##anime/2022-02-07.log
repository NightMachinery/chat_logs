[00:05:29] <MootPoot> what distro should I install on a borked laptop
[00:05:42] <MootPoot> broken screen hinges - its from like 2010
[00:05:50] <MootPoot> still has a quad core i7 tbo
[00:13:28] <MootPoot> maybe when ddr5 is cheap and I can get a decent gpu for close to MSRP - I might replace this laptop system with a ITX linux build
[00:13:56] <Bco1981> well... one can dream...
[00:14:14] <MootPoot> I'm legit surprised that people are still scalping ddr5
[00:14:19] <MootPoot> I mean, gpus...I get it
[00:14:58] <Bco1981> they will scalp anything that is hot
[00:15:10] <MootPoot> but the perf benefit isen't there yet for ddr5...and you cant make money off of it like GPUs...and there is shit tons of ddr4 which works just fine to go around
[00:17:32] <Bco1981> is there any igpu comparison performance ddr4 vs ddr5 ?

[00:40:23] <Satin> have a taste of what's going on here
[00:40:43] <MootPoot> They need to get out there, protest, use that energy, and like emmeka said, realize that big shows of people don't really do anything politically like what the left has learned over and over 
[00:41:08] <Satin>  idk why em would say that
[00:41:11] <Satin> they do make a difference
[00:41:18] <Satin> not practically, but in the bigger picture yeah
[00:41:22] <Satin> absolutely have an effect on things
[00:41:28] <MootPoot> The only thing that came of the capitol riots was the pure destruction of the right wings cohesiveness in the UD

[00:41:41] <MootPoot> They fucked themselves

[00:42:05] <Satin> nope
[00:42:13] <Satin> the republican party has kicked out anyone who challenges trump
[00:42:18] <Satin> they're more unified than the left currently :)
[00:42:23] <Satin> you're wrong about this
[00:42:38] <Satin> also republicans bitch a lot but then they come together when it comes to voting or whatever it is
[00:42:38] <MootPoot> I never said the left was unified 
[00:42:45] <Satin> driven by their shared reactionary garbage
[00:42:46] <MootPoot> Left is shit at getting together 
[00:42:49] <Satin> the left is more divided
[00:43:03] <MootPoot> What I'm saying is that the right had a loss from the capitol riots, not a gain 
[00:43:06] <Satin> the capitol riots just threw the US into more turmoil in the long term
[00:43:13] <MootPoot> I'm not doing a comparative here 
[00:43:17] <Satin> it has real consequences 
[00:43:23] <Satin> even if it's just a building

[00:45:23] <MootPoot> Much doubt 
[00:45:33] <ButterNoodle> yea its not
[00:45:43] <MootPoot> So let's get this straight t
[00:46:00] <MootPoot> You two think the capitol riots was a net win for the right in the US? 
[00:46:16] <ButterNoodle> more so anyone that deviates from the narrative is a racist nazi fascist
[00:46:51] <MootPoot> Egg sandwich or fish sandwich 
[00:46:52] <MootPoot> Hmm
[00:47:09] <MootPoot> Fish
[00:47:42] <Satin> MootPoot: it wasn't a "win" but it wasn't a bad thing by any means for them yeah
[00:48:00] <Satin> MootPoot: it didn't lead to a massive switch in support for democrats over republicans at all
[00:48:00] <ButterNoodle> You two think the riots was a net win for the right in the US? <- no we had a whole year of violent deadly riots.. no one said shit until 5 people died at the capitol riots
[00:48:17] <MootPoot> Again, comparitives 
[00:48:34] <Satin> in fact it accelerated the republican party switching to populist garbage
[00:48:38] <MootPoot> What's the difference between the public view before and after 
[00:48:39] <Satin> possibly fascism in the long term
[00:48:47] <MootPoot> You can dislike both parties 
[00:48:49] <Satin> all the neoliberals in the party are being kicked out
[00:49:05] <Satin> and the populists with authoritian/fascist rethoric are in
[00:49:08] <ButterNoodle> yea democrats need a "big reset"
[00:49:42] <ButterNoodle> republicans need rid of trump
[00:49:55] <Satin> that's not happening
[00:49:59] <Satin> instead they're embracing trump
[00:50:04] <ButterNoodle> and the other parties need to sound off like they got a pair
[00:50:04] <Satin> and kicking out anyone who doesn't support trump
[00:50:07] <MootPoot> I need cute girls
[00:50:08] <ButterNoodle> its what they know..
[00:50:28] <ButterNoodle> just like dems are gonna support the fascists they have now
[00:50:30] <Satin> in any case, populism is the flavour of the decade
[00:50:33] <MootPoot> Well, maybe the ground reality is different

[01:38:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: RISC-V is fine. The RISC-V Foundation sucks though and actively compromises its usefulness.
[01:38:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> RISC-V as it is requires extensions for real use, and they're very unfriendly to non-corporate users intent on making extensions.

[02:37:32] <Nanobot> I have to admit, the first time I listened to this song, I didn't hear the "thumb" part of the line "thumb-sucking little boys" and got concerned.
[02:38:21] <Bco1981> oh, very easy.
[02:46:03] <Nanobot> I said 5 songs, but it looks like it's actually 4. The fifth was a livestream to talk about the songs.

[02:48:06] <Satin> miles*
[02:48:23] <ButterNoodle> ?
[02:48:26] <ButterNoodle> oh
[02:48:32] <ButterNoodle> depends on the car
[02:48:42] <ButterNoodle> and the cost..
[02:50:05] <ButterNoodle> I've been shopping for an expedition/suburban to pull my cargo trailer... depending on the engine/transmission combo that would dictate what I would pay and the mileage I'd find acceptable
[02:50:42] <ButterNoodle> there were some that the transmission would need to be replaces around 200K.. so if its already at 190... you can start to expect issues 
[02:50:45] <ButterNoodle> but
[02:51:22] <ButterNoodle> on cars, if its japanese for the most part - 300K before MAJOR issues.. but 200k is the point where minor things wear out
[02:51:27] <Nanobot> TIL Hololive is a fine dining restaurant.
[02:51:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: Indeed.
[02:52:59] <ButterNoodle> Satin: u tell me its a altima/camry/accord I'd say as long as the interior is -like-new- shape and its clean under the hood, its probably good for 100K more miles

[02:53:43] <Satin> ooh
[02:54:43] <ButterNoodle> as a ford person.. they do have sporadic QC issues and u have to be more careful on what models/makes u get
[02:55:04] <ButterNoodle> as a generalization.. u dont have to mess with japanese cars as much
[02:55:35] <Sxem> i just found out that that rule that you have to leave 15% of your hard drive empty, is only for system drives. for data drives, you can leave just 5% of it empty and nothing bad will happen. 
[02:56:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That rule really only matters on obsolete filesystems.
[02:56:08] <Sxem> ive complained to so many hundreds of ppl how hard it is for me to keep 15% of the hd empty, and i bet they all knew that that was just for system drives, and didnt bother to tell me.

[06:15:40] <Satin> ambulance took them away but holy fuck 
[06:15:49] <Satin> ig not life threatneing injuries
[06:15:54] <Satin> they had a passenger too
[06:15:56] <Satin> but there goes my car
[06:16:04] <Satin> and i have liability only insurance
[06:16:15] * PancakeMatsuri sold his car
[06:16:16] <Satin> because i'm 22 and insurance companies charge my age group crazy unaffordable rates for full coverage -=.-
[06:16:37] <Satin> hoping her insurance company will pay me something..........
[06:16:42] <Satin> once i get the details >:c
[06:16:43] <gh0s1> wtf
[06:16:46] <gh0s1> did you crash your car?
[06:16:54] * Satin bites gh0s1 
[06:17:02] <gh0s1> ow
[06:17:03] <S_T_A_N> lol
[06:17:04] <Satin> no, my car got total'd by some retard at 1 am last night
[06:17:12] <Satin> no offense to her
[06:17:16] <gh0s1> were you in the car?
[06:17:18] <Satin> but you don't hit a fucking properly parked car
[06:17:20] <Satin> at 1 am
[06:17:28] <gh0s1> drunk?
[06:17:39] <Satin> and forcing it two car distances back and shit, on a wide open empty weekend no-other-sudents-parking-around road
[06:17:44] <gh0s1> jfc
[06:17:46] <Satin> presumably drunk, at least from the rumour i heard
[06:17:52] <Satin> from my housemate who was talking to the cop
[06:17:53] <gh0s1> yeah, looking at backlog. they were probably drunk
[06:17:58] <gh0s1> I'm glad you weren't in there
[06:18:01] <S_T_A_N> dumbfuck didn't even get their darwin award
[06:18:03] <Satin> not 100% confirmed but it sounds like the cop had an initial impression of that
[06:18:07] <Satin> i was in the house yeah
[06:18:09] <gh0s1> sue the fuck out of them
[06:18:17] <gh0s1> show no mercy
[06:18:21] <gh0s1> get a new car
[06:18:25] <Satin> S_T_A_N: i don't want them to die but i sure don't want to suffer with no car out of this and no money
[06:18:31] <Satin> meh
[06:18:31] <S_T_A_N> with blackjack and hookers
[06:18:47] <Satin> i'll contact my insurance company tomorrow finally since it's a monday
[06:18:57] <Satin> even though they're useless since it's liability only insurance
[06:19:12] <gh0s1> doesn't matter
[06:19:14] <gh0s1> call them anyway
[06:19:16] <Satin> and then aggressively phone the police department here
[06:19:22] <Satin> because 5-7 days is a long time for a police report
[06:19:26] <Satin> that i need insurance details from
[06:19:30] <Satin> of the other person
[06:19:52] <Satin> yeah ill call them anyway
[06:19:59] <Satin> but yeah now i don't have a car T_T
[06:20:05] <Satin> in a mostly spread out area
[06:20:44] <gh0s1> does your insurance include rentals?
[06:20:49] <Satin> no
[06:20:56] <gh0s1> :(
[06:21:00] <Satin> it's just towing service if necessary and liability iirc
[06:21:12] <Satin> i might call the towing service and pray that they have coverage here in new mexico here
[06:21:14] <Satin> too*
[06:21:16] <Satin> and not just missouri
[06:21:24] <Satin> coz all the details are missouri
[06:21:47] <Satin> you guys think this will be declared total'd or nah:

[06:22:22] <gh0s1> airbag went off?
[06:22:36] <gh0s1> probably tbh. looks like frame damage
[06:22:57] <Satin> airbag in their car went off, not mine
[06:23:06] <Satin> gh0s1: yeah, crumple zones seems gone at least
[06:23:21] <Satin> airbag in only one side of their car went off, not even the other side*
[06:23:21] <gh0s1> crumple zones are easily replaceable
[06:23:30] <gh0s1> but once your frame gets touched
[06:23:32] <gh0s1> best to total it
[06:23:40] <Satin> unibody frame moment
[06:23:52] <gh0s1> yep
[06:23:56] <gh0s1> as is like 90% of cars now

[07:03:30] <ButterNoodle> its 2022 - extensive frame damage
[07:03:40] <Satin> i'm not spending thousands of dollars on fixing it if it isn't worth it
[07:03:48] <Satin> i'm not going to get compensanted that much probably even
[07:03:49] <ButterNoodle> you shouldnt spend a penny
[07:03:55] <ButterNoodle> nor get a new car payment
[07:04:07] <Satin> *hope* she had a good insurance.
[07:04:10] <ButterNoodle> ur insurance will make their insurance pay
[07:04:16] <ButterNoodle> they have to
[07:04:20] <Satin> i have liability insurance on mine
[07:04:21] <ButterNoodle> what company?
[07:04:22] <Satin> not full insurance
[07:04:27] <ButterNoodle> doesnt matter
[07:04:27] <Satin> state farm
[07:04:38] <ButterNoodle> if 2 people have liability.. thiers pays urs
[07:05:17] <ButterNoodle> yea state farm will get theirs to pay for it, and make sure u tell them to pay ur deductable if there is any claim involved
[07:05:37] <ButterNoodle> nor ur fault.. u dont have to pay a deductible
[07:06:16] <ButterNoodle> especially since it was a parked car.. there is no arguing that
[07:06:20] <Satin> Yeah.
[07:06:24] <Satin> It was a properly parked car.
[07:07:11] <Satin> going to try to get the police report as quickly and aggressively as possible
[07:07:18] <ButterNoodle> even if it was stopped in the middle of the road.. any sober attentive driver would see a big fucking car even in the middle of the road stopped

[07:29:56] <isekaijin> Does anyone here know if it's possible to tell Google not to spell-check your queries?
[07:30:18] <isekaijin> I mean, once and for all, not just by adding quotation marks to every individual query.
[07:31:33] *** Joins: NllPtr (~NllPtr@89.45.90.214)
[07:31:37] <isekaijin> Problem is, Google struggles to understand any language whose grammar is even slightly more complicated than English's. So its grammar and spelling “corrections” are simply wrong.

[07:36:32] <isekaijin> Google makes mistakes that Word 97's spell checker would not have made.

[09:58:36] <JesseDesu2> i have that on my airbrush compressor
[09:58:38] <ButterNoodle> yea on the fuel rail
[09:58:46] <JesseDesu2> whats a fuel rail
[09:58:58] <JesseDesu2> this aint no sig p226
[09:59:11] <ButterNoodle> it will tarnish up inside and cause too little or too much fuel

[10:00:06] <ButterNoodle> fuel rail goes across the injectors
[10:00:19] <ButterNoodle> has input from fuel pump on one side and regulator on the other
[10:00:43] <JesseDesu2> i'll try the fuel treatment first
[10:00:44] <ButterNoodle> it keep it at ~60psi iirc.. and just recirculates the excess
[10:00:54] <JesseDesu2> its like 5 or 10 $ at o reilys right
[10:01:02] <ButterNoodle> yea mine was clogged once on the f4i
[10:01:08] <ButterNoodle> yea its around that $$
[10:01:17] <JesseDesu2> sounds like a 5-10$ product
[10:01:22] <JesseDesu2> like seafoam
[10:01:28] <JesseDesu2> or mystery oil
[10:01:33] <ButterNoodle> mine was bad enough that WOT it was flooding the 4th cylinder and white smoking from over fueling
[10:01:53] <JesseDesu2> is it a teaspooon 
[10:01:59] <JesseDesu2> or a capful
[10:02:09] <JesseDesu2> per tank
[10:02:12] <ButterNoodle> I think I used 2 capfulls on a full tank
[10:02:21] <JesseDesu2> ok
[10:02:40] <ButterNoodle> try just one.. I dont think urs sound that bad..
[10:02:42] <ButterNoodle> run a tank
[10:02:46] <ButterNoodle> if it still bad try 2
[10:02:47] <JesseDesu2> i had a fuel system treatment on the triumph for $300 i think
[10:02:55] <ButterNoodle> *then its time for the shop
[10:02:59] <JesseDesu2> the total was 600 with some other stuff
[10:03:08] <JesseDesu2> i went to a top notch ducati dealer
[10:03:17] <JesseDesu2> ducati shop i mean
[10:03:21] <ButterNoodle> 300 is a bit much to run some stuff through it 
[10:03:37] <JesseDesu2> they did a full treatment cuz it had water in it
[10:03:48] <JesseDesu2> the last owner was an outside parker
[10:04:28] <ButterNoodle> yuck
[10:04:32] <JesseDesu2> the ducati shop will do triumph and some honda sportbikes
[10:04:36] <ButterNoodle> I park outside at work...
[10:04:40] <JesseDesu2> metoo
[10:04:53] <JesseDesu2> when it rains i put a plastic cover on the tank
[10:04:59] <JesseDesu2> i dont trust the cap
[10:05:23] <JesseDesu2> theres no rubber seal
[10:05:31] <JesseDesu2> the f4i has a rubber seal
[10:05:57] <JesseDesu2> the triumph doesnt have a lock either
[10:06:33] <JesseDesu2> someone could just dump sugar in it
[10:06:44] <JesseDesu2> or siphon steal it
[10:06:45] <ButterNoodle> yea
[10:06:49] <ButterNoodle> or pee in it
[10:07:20] <JesseDesu2> thats a mcguiver myth i think
[10:07:27] <JesseDesu2> for sabotage
[10:07:38] <ButterNoodle> sugar?
[10:07:44] <ButterNoodle> pretty sure its real
[10:07:50] <JesseDesu2> you could easily put anything that will stop the engine

[16:32:16] <Bco1981> onmy headset there is buildt in headphones
[16:32:17] <MootPoot> I use BT from my PC to headset I wear seperately but on occasion it cuts on, dunno why
[16:32:26] <MootPoot> cuts out*
[16:32:49] <MootPoot> is headset audio reliable? I do have a 3.5mm jack I can try
[16:33:19] <Bco1981> not sure with the quest2, my good old CV1 works perfectly, but that's hdmi wired.
[16:34:24] <Bco1981> you could try if you have some ear plugs, and see if that cuts out too.

[16:35:52] <MootPoot> yeah I'm not 100% sure if its the BT with issues or the game audio
[16:35:58] <MootPoot> Sadale: still has problems
[16:36:11] <MootPoot> inconsistent extrusion
[16:36:17] <MootPoot> trying to fix it
[16:36:34] <MootPoot> seems that the main fix is finding the exact temp for the PLA to print at
[16:36:50] <Sadale> moaw...
[16:36:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, aww... *
[16:37:17] <MootPoot> it leaks out by itself so I'm guessing currently its too hot
[16:37:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, I think that's normal
[16:37:37] <MootPoot> seems like about 195 on the nozzle and 60 on the plate is deal
[16:37:48] <MootPoot> Sadale: I'll send you a picture to show you what it looks like
[16:39:04] *** Parts: shrippen[m] (~shrippena@2001:470:69fc:105::1:9440) ()
[16:39:26] <MootPoot> Sadale: but all of that is supposed to be smooth
[16:39:43] <MootPoot> I think what happens is that it leaks out a little extra earlier/later then its supposed to due to temp
[16:39:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, yeah. Seems that you've got another problem other than bed leveling
[16:39:52] <MootPoot> so a random section has less then its supposed to
[16:40:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, Actually I think that you may be having under extrusion. That'd explain the holes
[16:40:58] <MootPoot> yeah, so what I'm thinking might be the cause is that the high temp is making the part in the extruder partially leak out earlier 
[16:41:00] <MootPoot> then expected
[16:41:19] <MootPoot> so when it starts a new layer its printing with a inconsistent flow
[16:41:52] <MootPoot> but its good that its actually printing a visible thing - before it wasen't even doing that lol
[16:42:26] <MootPoot> I have 2kg more of PLA I can try, I think with enough adjustment / trial I can figure it out
[16:43:58] <MootPoot> LOL

[16:44:21] <Sadale> MootPoot, Your temperature sound normal. The next thing I'd try is to move the bed up. :p
[16:44:33] <MootPoot> wym move the bed up?
[16:44:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol funny quote
[16:44:55] <MootPoot> I did this last print at 210 and got that problem
[16:45:03] <Sadale> oh.
[16:45:09] <Sadale> So at 195 it's normal?
[16:45:11] <MootPoot> I'm slowly lowering and testing again and again
[16:45:17] <Sadale> ok. good luck
[16:45:25] <MootPoot> I was having sticking problems at 195 - but that seems to have been fixed with a hotter bed
[16:45:36] <MootPoot> so it seems hot bed + cold ish nozzle
[16:47:41] <Sadale> Perhaps you're having extreme cold temperature up there in Canada. That's why the required nozzle and heat bed temps are different from mine
[16:47:53] <MootPoot> well, its in a basement that is 22C
[16:48:03] <MootPoot> this filament was exposed to extreme cold though
[16:48:08] <MootPoot> I left it in a unheated carage

[16:52:16] <MootPoot> Sadale: have you ever printed anything else other then PLA?
[16:52:25] <MootPoot> I have a roll of silver PETG I wanted to try
[16:52:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope. I only printed PLA
[16:52:53] <Sadale> I'm not sure if cold would damage PLA. But what I know is that moisture won't.
[16:53:16] <Sadale> I've got a very old wheel of PLA that I've put aside for like 2 years. And after that it was still working fine

[20:00:49] <MootPoot> since you can just refresh twice as fast right?
[20:01:05] <Bco1981> but the CL is way higher on the ddr5
[20:01:08] <MootPoot> so that means you can dump stuff into ram faster, take it out faster and push to/from swap faster

[20:31:49] <Satin> yeah
[20:31:53] <ButterNoodle> it was better off not telling him, and let him find the right answer on his onw

[20:33:35] <Satin> we've been alternating paying it
[20:33:41] <Satin> ever since i got you  know, shot and stuff
[20:33:46] <Satin> but he def is partly paying it.
[20:33:56] <ButterNoodle> one selfish bc he doesnt want the rates to go up and wants to manage it
[20:34:04] <ButterNoodle> other is bc he wants to take care of it for you

[20:34:12] <ButterNoodle> both reasons are pita
[20:34:12] <Satin> yeah
[20:34:25] <ButterNoodle> I solved that by getting my own insurance @22

[20:52:22] <Bco1981> my rpi raspbian is a playground, but it's solid. probably because not much is ready for arm64

[20:58:38] <Bco1981> rando25892: i noticed for 12 or 13 it was available from some repo, but it's not part of the iso.

[20:59:24] <lastonestanding> shell? or just reskin?
[20:59:31] <Satin> shell, not just a reskin
[20:59:37] <Satin> it adds tiling support at a toggle

[21:30:57] <rando25892> its harder just to buy the replacement fan and leave it aside than putting the part in i think its not hard though
[21:31:12] <rando25892> just plug pin in once you are there
[21:31:13] <JesseDesu> airbrushing is harder than i thought
[21:31:29] <rando25892> i agree taking the whole thing apart is the hardest part too
[21:31:41] <rando25892> its just, you have to
[21:31:44] <Bco1981> the fan it self is not hard. the problem is, not all laptops are that easy to even get to the point where you can start replacing the fan.
[21:32:18] <rando25892> well, if theres a fan inside, its still consider bulky enough to handle... and even then slim laptops, on a design by design basis good designs allow this
[21:32:41] <Bco1981> some asshole designers make them so, you have to remove the motherboard and turn it around to even get to the fan... and to get the motherboard out you have to take it completely... completely apart.
[21:32:41] <rando25892> and break it anyway dont just not try 8-D

[22:02:42] <MootPoot> idk
[22:03:27] <MootPoot> tbh, that 400 dollar price

[22:05:22] <Satin> WTF
[22:05:25] <Bco1981> netbooks was a mistake
[22:05:31] <Satin> ^
[22:05:47] <MootPoot> ipads are only really capable of content consumption - only a boomer would think you can do actual work on a ipad
[22:05:58] <MootPoot> "hey honey, look, I watch the youtube!"
[22:06:05] <Satin> except you can?
[22:06:10] <MootPoot> like what
[22:06:11] <Satin> there's plenty of things you can do on tablets these days
[22:06:23] <Satin> plenty of office editing with a bt keyboard for many people, surfing the web and so on
[22:06:27] <Bco1981> ipads... very expensive wifi photo frames...
[22:06:28] <Satin> it's not my preference of course
[22:06:29] <MootPoot> where are the lines of professonals buying ipads for work
[22:06:32] <Satin> but plenty of potions

[22:06:33] <MootPoot> Bco1981: +1

[22:06:59] <Satin> plenty use it for business stuff moot
[22:07:02] <Satin> this isn't that weird
[22:07:07] <MootPoot> viewing a word document dosen't count
[22:07:19] <rando25892> nah you most certainly could
[22:07:29] <Satin> none of those things
[22:07:29] <Satin> are
[22:07:33] <Satin> computionationally expensive
[22:07:37] <Satin> for an ipad
[22:07:41] <rando25892> i agree even in the space station where they use it. you gotta do it right. not just with non linux crud
[22:07:43] <Satin> and with the right apps/accesories pletny do that
[22:07:59] <Satin> obv not their primary probably

[22:08:08] <Satin> not a toy
[22:08:12] <MootPoot> its a toy
[22:08:16] <Satin> nah
[22:08:22] <Satin> not even remotely a toy
[22:08:29] <MootPoot> its fundamentally designed for consuming t
[22:08:31] <Satin> you know if i cared enough i would start googling for statistics
[22:08:33] <Satin> or surveys
[22:08:39] <Satin> for business users and ipads/tablets
[22:08:41] <Satin> and prove ur ass wrong
[22:08:48] <Satin> but i am not going to do that at this time.
[22:08:51] * Satin glares
[22:08:52] <MootPoot> fine - if it wasen't a toy = it would be the prime work device
[22:08:53] <MootPoot> but it isent
[22:09:02] <MootPoot> in fact the ipad got rejected from that task
[22:09:29] <Satin> i think you flatly underestimate how powerful the ipad's CPU is as well these days
[22:09:29] <rando25892> the new macbooks is an example

[22:12:16] <MootPoot> tell you what - how about you mainline an ipad for school, work and play for a month ( no using anything else ) then get back to me
[22:12:27] <rando25892> if nobody does any dtbs code for it sure. but usually the corpos need their own version as with the chromebooks... the macbooks got this
[22:12:34] <MootPoot> ^^
[22:12:50] <MootPoot> the macbook is the device where its all at
[22:13:24] <MootPoot> some humanities grad working at a office as a secretary who uses an ipad for viewing word files isen't going to change that 
[22:13:55] <rando25892> yea but if it were me who was that secretary... yes my chromebook is that ipad. and can do everything
[22:14:23] <rando25892> im not sure maybe you have a point the ipads can access stuff the chromebook services..
[22:14:26] <MootPoot> rando25892: would you pick a 800$ chromebook or an ipad if you were that secretary
[22:14:53] <MootPoot> chromebook anyday - actual windows, actual keyboard, actual desktop webapps....
[22:15:02] <MootPoot> can use a secondary display...
[22:15:58] <Bco1981> it does look nice... the steam deck
[22:16:16] <MootPoot> seems like its basically modern igpu tier graphics
[22:16:16] <Bco1981> but sounds like storage is a bit limited
[22:16:30] <Satin> I will concede on this topic only because i can't find any stastistics from a quick google search to go either way
[22:16:31] <MootPoot> I think you could get by with 256gb
[22:16:32] <Bco1981> unless you want to break your warranty
[22:17:31] <MootPoot> the only thing I dont like is that the anti glare screen cover is only on the highest end version
[22:17:38] <Bco1981> download COD... bam, half your storage is gone,
[22:17:46] <MootPoot> I get if they had to cut it for the base model
[22:17:53] <MootPoot> but coulda added it for the mid one
[22:18:03] <MootPoot> I mean, do you really want to play a game like cod on that thing?
[22:18:10] <Bco1981> no
[22:18:17] <rando25892> i think in the office you definitely need to have the OSS situation going. for basic shit like radio audio random stuff where you can press one thing to get that thing and begin working
[22:18:38] <rando25892> and bring it home and go all out
[22:19:04] <MootPoot> oh, you can plug shit in

[22:21:34] <MootPoot> hmm
[22:21:41] <Bco1981> lol
[22:22:12] <MootPoot> the problem for me...is that if I want to game on the go, the m1 air I have thrashes the deck
[22:22:16] <MootPoot> in every aspect
[22:22:34] <MootPoot> aside from game compatibility - but any game I would want to play on the go like that I wouldn't play on a deck either
[22:22:56] <MootPoot> surprisingly large amount of strategy games and stuff are ported to mac
[22:24:08] <beaky> Bco1981: woah korone has a nice perky body
[22:25:01] <MootPoot> beaky: will you get a steam deck to play eroge on the go?
[22:26:03] <beaky> woah is teh steam dekc already out
[22:26:23] <beaky> tho since im a neet hikikomori i dont think ill get it
[22:26:51] <MootPoot> but how will you play eroge when the power goes out and your NEET battlestation dosen't work anymore?

[22:49:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Imagine security domain isolation on remote VMs and remote low-power purpose-designated SBCs.
[22:50:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Having to get a stupidly expensive laptop? No longer a thing. Having to use proprietary hardware because Raptor Computing is unaffordable? No longer~!
[22:50:28] <MootPoot> uh
[22:50:33] <MootPoot> I still dont get it
[22:50:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because most open hardware & libre hardware stuff is woefully underpowered atm. But if you don't need everything to be in the same machine... then that's not a problem.
[22:51:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The issue is that you need/want a unified control UI for that which is not as disruptive as ssh-x-forwarding everything and works better.
[22:51:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (And safer)
[22:51:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can hack up something vaguely similar with Xpra & RPIs... but it'll be obvious it's a hack.
[22:52:08] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I wonder if valve would ever be open to just selling the motherboard on that thing - the whole conraption is 400 bucks,  - maybe 150 for the mobo that has  the cpu and ram on it - then maybe 25 more for a breakout board for i/o?
[22:52:31] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: you're gonna need to explain this in monkey terms
[22:52:31] <MootPoot> like
[22:52:35] <Bco1981> i doubt they would
[22:52:41] <Bco1981> would be awesome, but
[22:53:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Have cheapo laptop. Control dozen cheapo devices. Proper isolation. Good UI means easy control. Easy control good. Good = banana.
[22:53:13] <MootPoot> define isolation
[22:53:36] <rando25892> raptor computing is the powerpc solution to secure hardware
[22:53:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Part A is not part of Part B nor connected to it in any dangerous ways.
[22:53:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> rando25892: Yup. It's sadly quite expensive.
[22:54:02] <MootPoot> you have cheapo laptop controlling 10 rpis or other sbc idk  - but there is a interface layer preventing any bad stuff from coming through?
[22:54:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Not really, the isolation is preventing the bad stuff.
[22:54:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The interface layer is facilitating the use in a way that isn't awfully clunky without undermining the safety.
[22:54:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The only non-clunky ways at the moment compromise security.
[22:56:52] <MootPoot> that shit would blow the RPI out of the water if it was possible
[22:57:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed. And it is. Plan9 had something basically equivalent back in the days.
[22:57:27] <MootPoot> There does seem to be a replacement parts shop for the steam deck
[22:57:54] <MootPoot> as long as they sell mobos on there I guess somebody could get it to work
[22:58:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So we have precedent. But Plan9 has been dead for long-enough that reviving it isn't a good answer to the problem (it'd be too effort intensive))
[22:59:38] <MootPoot> the entire mobo does seem to be detachable
[22:59:49] <MootPoot> you'd have to come up with a cooling solution on your own

[23:22:55] <klaxa> <rando25892> ideally klaxa was going on about that minimalism thing just last week. im striving to do that do one day. once i learn enough
[23:23:03] <klaxa> cool, what did i say?
[23:26:18] <rando25892> well when it comes to virtualization and you can just run other OSes and distros in docker or qemu 
[23:27:11] <klaxa> not sure i said anything about that, but i think i did partake in a conversation about virtualization
[23:27:26] <rando25892> yea i just took that bit from it
[23:27:30] <rando25892> not exactly that
[23:27:54] <rando25892> im only thinking if you want to code in VScode you can run it in a virtual environment along those lines
[23:28:01] <klaxa> if it helped you reach some insight, it works for me~

[23:36:49] <Nanobot> Bitcoin is almost at a significant OTE short zone (current price: $44400, OTE zone: $44784 - $48001). Not a good place to panic-buy.

[23:43:30] <Nanobot> I wrote a story about a man who acquires exotic animals, puts them in human skinsuits, and uses them as exotic dancers. Spoiler: The panther was a mistake.
[23:51:30] <Terminus> Nanobot: so i guess you're saying i should prepare to sell. 😂
[23:52:11] <Nanobot> I'm not saying that. I'm not planning to sell my bitcoins.
[23:52:30] <Terminus> wonder if it'll hit 65k again in the next 6 months.
[23:52:38] <Nanobot> But, that's a price range where people will be looking to sell, relatively speaking, so expect some resistance there.
[23:52:41] <dweltstorm> i really hope not
[23:52:46] <dweltstorm> ive been wanting a new gpu

[23:53:26] <Terminus> Nanobot: yep. been seeing that resistance ever since the most recent drop to 33k.
[23:55:12] <Nanobot> Currently, the only active OTE long zone is below $28737, so it's pretty risky to buy above that.

[23:57:51] <Nanobot> Terminus: I mean... the bottom of that OTE zone is in the lower $17ks.
[23:58:30] <Terminus> Nanobot: so what you're saying is, gone are the days of a 4k bottom. 😀
