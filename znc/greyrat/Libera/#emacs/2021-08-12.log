[00:14:32] <acdw> i think i actually only want it in most places. I ran into the issue specifically with embark, which uses C-h for help, but not F1.  Maybe I should just fix it on that level...
[00:15:41] <edgar-rft> acdw: C-h is the standard "help" prefix key, it just points to another keymap. To rebind C-h to a key you first must unbind C-h via global-unset-key (or something similar, must look it up myself), only then global-set-key works. This is to prevent important keys from accidental rebinding. Note that probably most emacs builtin help functions won't work anymore because you have stolen the prefix key..
[00:16:21] <acdw> most builtin help functions work with <F1> as well -- both work with the <help> key

[00:52:43] <irek> hi o/  I did code in C for a while but I have no experience in debugging.  I wander is using Emacs stuff for debugging C (like gdb, or something else) is worth learning and using at all or maybe there is some other program (tui/gui) that is much better for this job?  Anyone have an opinion / experience?
[00:53:00] <kensanata> I'm sure there is a market for a ride-sharing, part-time working gig kind of association with a nice app. But this particular Uber company really has to die.
[00:53:20] <dale> kensanata: Agreed, Uber in particular seems shitty.
[00:53:24] <bpalmer> irek: I have almost always used printf debugging which doesn't require much if any emacs support; or I've used gdb in a separate xterm
[00:54:43] <dale> irek: DAP is the new kid on the block alongside LSP, and it seems like it actually has some Emacs support: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/#debugging
[00:54:44] <irek> bpalmer: I also have used only printf up to this point
[00:54:46] <dale> irek: I have never used it.
[00:54:47] <kensanata> Same, I hardly ever do stuff in C, so the handful of times I needed it, gdb was tricky enough, setting breakpoints in plugins that weren't loaded at startup and similar stuff, so when I eventually needed it, I always went without gdb mode in Emacs.

[01:50:31] <acdw> for me, the commands you mentioned do set C-h to be backward-delete-char-untabify globally, and F1 still works... however apparently that's not totally what I want since in paredit, e.g., still just backspace does what it needs to do.. of cuorse.. I think I need to rethink what i want, lol
[01:50:36] <Viking667> (that was supposed to be a raised eyebrow)
[01:50:49] <acdw> :D
[01:51:02] <acdw> tho i'm curious why your f1 didn't work... are you on 28? i'm 27
[01:52:12] <edgar-rft> acdw: it might be something in my init file because F1 opens the info browser here
[01:52:14] <acdw> honestly maybe i ought to just rebind C-h to a different prefix .. i like the F1 help thing. or i could make F1 find-file or soemthing.... or switch-to-buffer
[01:52:18] <acdw> ahhhh
[01:52:27] <acdw> I have <help> I for info
[01:52:36] <acdw> rather, <help> i

[01:55:03] <edgar-rft> Viking667: C-h and F1 both are keys or key-combos that both are set as the help key prefix by default, but can be configured to do two different things.
[01:55:26] <Viking667> And I've got a standard PC keyboard, but some termcap/terminfo sequences seem to change between exactly what escape sequences they work with for F1-4
[01:55:35] <acdw> how do you find the keymap that a leader key binds to? C-h k doesn't work because it waits on the next press
[01:56:01] <Viking667> and describe-key does the same thing?
[01:56:12] <acdw> yeah C-h k is describe-key
[01:56:44] <rpav> is there an easy (existing) function that's "add whitespace to the beginning of the lines in the region"
[01:56:46] <edgar-rft> Emacs key combos traditionally are a big mess by default, that's why you can rebind nearly everything yourself :-)
[01:57:14] <rpav> not "automagically indent" because that breaks, just a simple "add/remove whitespace" (right i want removal too)

[02:04:11] <edgar-rft> The problem with key-combos is that emacs is an ordinary user-space program, what means that the OS kernel, the keyboard driver, the terminal settings or the desktop GUI system, they all can "catch away" keystrokes that never reach emacs, what makes it very difficult to provide default keybindings that work in all environments equally well.

[06:07:22] <davidshen84> Actually, almost everying I do can be done on a Linux machine. But my company gave me a Windows :(

[07:18:33] <corwin> hrm, that's a fair point, in fact.  Let's toss that about, a bit..
[07:19:38] <corwin> Here what I really want is two things: first come file level privacy (clearly an OS domain thing, and also irritatating as I've been considering how the "recipie" to describe the needed org-env can be minimized.
[07:20:01] <twb> I have no idea what that means
[07:20:12] <corwin> That is, docker makes it fairly easy to guard a VM to consider it's /data as /data/vm3
[07:20:46] <corwin> but to have the owner of that folder and the files in mean anything in terms of a web-facing app is a fantastic problem space for the idel yet brillient.
[07:21:27] <twb> I have no idea what that means either
[07:21:42] <corwin> anyway, point is I clearly *don't* need docker to get that.  A user per game, for example would give me an owner and permission set for /data/game2

[07:44:38] <aidalgol> Why use *emacs* for this at all?
[07:44:48] <aidalgol> And why one process per game entity?  This is madness.
[07:44:52] <twb> All docker (or systemd-machined) really gives you on top of those is the ability to deliberately install shit versions of libraries

[07:47:31] <twb> corwin: what does "babel" mean to you
[07:47:45] <corwin> I mean source code blocks executed usually by pressing C-c C-c
[07:47:51] <aidalgol> corwin: Sounds like you're making problems that aren't inherent to the problem you're trying to solve.
[07:48:22] <twb> so babel is basically noweb/tangle ?
[07:48:29] <twb> How is that anything to do with multiple languages
[07:48:32] <corwin> aidalgol: sounds like the sort of thing I might do.  Can you restate my problem so it doesn't include the complixity you a referring to?
[07:48:57] <twb> Are you proposing to write a file that is both valid punjabi and farsi, somehow, while also being executable code?
[07:48:59] <corwin> twb: no, tangle creates files.  the key function here is `org-sbe'
[07:49:37] <aidalgol> corwin: Your problem statement is, "I want to make multiplayer, top-down dungeon crawler," is it not?
[07:49:46] <corwin> twb: I bet that was a joke that went over my head..
[07:50:09] <twb> "PoV of the different languagse"
[07:50:20] <twb> Maybe you meant programming languages?
[07:50:22] <corwin> aidalgol: ah!  no. but I see why you might think that and I'd suspect more people would be interested than in what I'm actually creating.
[07:50:32] <aidalgol> corwin: Then what is it?
[07:50:36] <twb> So everyone who plays the game still has to speak English

[07:51:41] <aidalgol> OK, I don't understand this at all, then.

[07:53:59] <twb> aidalgol: it's also used in e.g. KOTOR1 and 2
[07:54:11] <aidalgol> KOTOR the MMORPG?
[07:54:16] <aidalgol> Or was there a TTRPG first?
[07:54:18] <corwin> twb: That's exactly right, tbh modulo the fact that we are turning into a turned based engine (and now a multi-player arcade in nodejs and maybe docker or proxmox, also)
[07:54:19] <twb> Also all the old like Neverwynter Nights and similar Diablo-era games

[07:55:12] <twb> corwin: "I want to digitize my old game notes" and "I want to make a multiplayer networked D20-like game engine"
[07:55:19] <twb> aidalgol: you are thinking of SW TOR
[07:55:29] <corwin> that I want to find my game notes and that I want to play with my friend?  I'd say I want to find my notes *so* I can play with my friends, and call it one problem.
[07:55:29] <twb> aidalgol: which is much later and is an MMO
[07:55:36] <aidalgol> I had that and https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286830/STAR_WARS_The_Old_Republic/ mashed up in my head as one game.
[07:55:48] <twb> aidalgol: congratulations, you fell for marketing
[07:55:56] <himesama> what are typical computers characterized as in terms of theory of computing?  von neumann and change, but where does that stand wrt turing or church?
[07:56:06] <aidalgol> twb: Well I didn't really care for prequel Star Wars, so I never paid much attention.
[07:56:18] <twb> himesama: von neumann is a turing machine with a shared tape
[07:56:24] <corwin> Not that I don't enjoy discussing the validity of my problem space, but did anyone have more specific thoughts on how vs docker I should ensure theat people's code blocks are sperate when I execute them?
[07:56:30] <himesama> surely also it is a finite tape
[07:56:38] <aidalgol> himesama: No, it as an infinite tape.
[07:56:39] <twb> himesama: harvard has separate program and data tapes
[07:56:52] <twb> himesama: in all cases the tape is nominally infinite
[07:57:16] <aidalgol> The mathematical models of computing are much more primitive than actual computers, but have these convenient (for mathematicians) simplifications like infinite tape.
[07:57:42] <himesama> so we just say ok these things are turing machines?
[07:57:47] <aidalgol> I don't know which, if any, microcontrollers have been proven to be fully computable.
[07:57:56] <twb> himesama: yes
[07:58:09] <aidalgol> corwin: We're still trying to understand what you're trying to do.
[07:58:23] <aidalgol> I'm not seeing how org babel fits into your problem.
[07:58:30] <aidalgol> How does it help you play games?
[07:58:39] <corwin> twb: maybe useful to differenciate dungeon from some assumptions you might have: our notes do contain all the information needed to play these various games.  there aren't "systems" this stuff plus into, apart from some pretty generic rules for dungeon that we'll also let you replace with your own.  so you can create some system that you might know, but this isn't.
[07:59:02] <twb> aidalgol: they're trying to build a thing that lets them play D&D online, but still implements 90% of the rules inside their brains instead of in software.
[07:59:22] <twb> aidalgol: and then add bodgy scripts to reduce that from 90% to 60%, e.g. automating dice rolls
[07:59:43] <aidalgol> corwin: If it's assistant code snippets, wouldn't you have one person acting as game master and running emacs to read the docs and run all that code?
[07:59:59] <aidalgol> And talk to the other players via IRC?
[08:00:05] <twb> aidalgol: yeah the lofi version of this would just be IRC or libobby
[08:00:10] <twb> aidalgol: and a shared buffer
[08:00:28] <aidalgol> I don't see how a "hifi" version of this would even work.
[08:00:30] <twb> there's like 50 licenses on steam that are basically this
[08:00:32] <twb> and they're all awful
[08:00:38] <corwin> aidalgol: well..  I mean.  If this is an invite to deep dive into my favorite game... I will?  We did do a few talks last emacs conf, however, I feel obligated to say: https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/

[08:05:47] <Viking667> 's all right. When I was growing up, AD&D was a thing.
[08:06:12] <corwin> yeah, this whole thing started when some folks got really pissed at that getting shrinkwrapped, in some sense.  that's the point at which the rules started getting writtin down formally enough that we can probably automate a greate number of them given a flexable enough engine.

[15:06:05] <rnkn> you can write something in org-mode, convert to texinfo then info
[15:06:28] <rnkn> but texinfo is kinda designed to be the originating format
[15:07:05] <jfb4> the use case I have in mind is converting docs from the web (eg readthedocs) into info, sort of the inverse of Sphinx (?)

[20:40:55] <backleet> bpalmer: nothing referencing ccls in list-load-path-shadows. Thanks! I am new to emacs, is ccls package correct one for lsp? I have ccls language server installed. even just running (use-package ccls) results in this error, so I am not sure where else autoload is defined?

[20:43:09] <bpalmer> backleet: use-package is a macro that helps set up autoloading or deferred loading of packages and libraies (so that emacs starts quickly).

[20:43:45] <bpalmer> so it makes sense that , if one thing triggers autoload errors, that use-pcakage might be involved.
[20:44:01] <bpalmer> backleet: instead of (use-package ccls), you might try (require 'ccls)  or (load "ccls") to try to load it immediately
[20:44:14] <bpalmer> (I don't use ccls or lsp, so my experience here is very limited)
[20:46:07] <ano> who did invent C- M- S- modkeys abbrevs? where they first appeared, emacs?
[20:46:13] <bpalmer> assuming this is https://github.com/MaskRay/emacs-ccls, the error message seems on point: it doesn't define a function named ccls, nor is that how you're supposed to invoke it.
[20:46:16] <backleet> bpalmer: I see, thank you! even official wiki of ccls recommends this https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/wiki/lsp-mode#use-package

[20:48:07] <bpalmer> backleet: ok, but their use-package form is more complicated than just (use-package ccls)
