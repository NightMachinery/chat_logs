[00:00:05] <da_wunder> none
[00:00:15] <grawity> ...I'm going to guess browsers actually don't, and it's either some fancy client-side JS or some server-side preprocessing; I've seen <script> being abused in a similar way
[00:01:00] <Albright> ahhhhhh
[00:01:47] <Albright> OH
[00:01:51] <Albright> It's a casing thing I bet
[00:02:25] <Albright> macOS's case-insensitive filesystems letting stuff fly that Linux's do not
[00:02:50] <grawity> don't worry you can make ext4 case-insensitive now too
[00:03:07] <Albright> I'd rather go the other way. Make macOS case-sensitive.
[00:03:14] <da_wunder> ^
[00:03:16] <grawity> hmm, thought APFS always is
[00:03:34] <Albright> I think there are ways to do it but then random Mac stuff will break.
[00:03:37] <__adrian> case-insensitive file systems are idiotic
[00:03:44] <da_wunder> ^
[00:04:50] <Albright> How do I even commit a filename change in Git when the FS doesn't "see" it?
[00:05:11] <Albright> Ah, I guess I can commit it from the server.
[00:05:31] <da_wunder> or just use proper OS
[00:05:37] <grawity> it probably does, it might be case-insensitive but it's nevertheless case-preserving -- it's often specifically Git that's configured to ignore case changes though (like in git config)
[00:07:42] <Albright> I found https://stackoverflow.com/a/53116/11023 but even when set to "false" `git diff` still doesn't show the filename change on Mac.
[00:08:26] *** Quits: guidoc (~guido@host-95-247-248-249.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[00:08:46] <__adrian> apparently you can use git to rename the file, instead of rely on the fs to tell git it was renamed
[00:08:56] <__adrian> git mv File.php file.php
[00:09:06] <__adrian> (untested but makes sense)
[00:09:40] <Albright> Yeah, I just thought of that too. It's failing because the destination already exists. Let me try renaming them back and then trying that.
[00:09:55] <__adrian> grawity: ...i've never seen anyone configure git that way (and didn't know it was possible)
[00:10:16] <grawity> iirc if you install Git on Windows, you get asked whether to enable that
[00:10:18] <Albright> Yeah, still saying "fatal: destination exists"
[00:10:36] <Byteflux> rename it to something else completely
[00:10:41] <Byteflux> then try again from there.
[00:10:43] <grawity> (incidentally, Windows now supports marking directories as case-sensitive, but the feature is for some reason tied to WSL being installed)
[00:10:49] <da_wunder> so as I said - 22:35 < da_wunder> or just use proper OS
[00:10:51] <Albright> Nah, screw it, I'm going back to doing it from the server
[00:10:55] <grawity> if everything else fails, git update-index
[00:11:17] <Byteflux> it's likely because you're trying to rename from one name to another, but both names are the same, just difference case
[00:11:27] <Byteflux> may work if you simply tried to rename from completely different name
[00:11:29] <Albright> Well, yes
[00:12:35] <Byteflux> instead of `git mv abc ABC` try `git mv abc xyz` and then `git mv xyz ABC`
[00:14:36] <Albright> Okay, it worked on the server. And yes, the casing was the problem. No errors now.
[00:15:06] <Albright> Well… at least things working like they should be after fixing something dumb like that is kind of… un-unmotivating.
[00:15:26] <Albright> un-demotivating

[00:34:41] <__adrian> backslash

[00:35:02] <da_wunder> de-facto: see namespaces
[00:35:12] <__adrian> de-facto: highly recommend aliasing, do not litter your code with \
[00:35:19] <__adrian> use `use` instead
[00:36:00] <da_wunder> and with that eg. PhpStorm would help you a lot - just hit alt+enter on those and it'll do that all for you
[00:37:10] <de-facto> those backslashes look super weird to read
[00:37:35] <__adrian> i'd suggest that's only because you don't understand/aren't used to them

[00:38:34] <TernaryOperator> Albright: good luck with the search
[00:38:41] <de-facto> so how would that be employed? $actionFac = new \ActionFactory();  becomes ??
[00:38:49] <__adrian> it becomes nothing

[00:39:04] <__adrian> the backslash means "root namespace"

[01:55:34] <Stanley> Byteflux alright went out, bought a M.2 SSD and installed it into my unraid server, installed a new Ubuntu 20.04 VM there and got docker running and now that command runs at 618MB/s
[02:02:01] <Byteflux> Stanley: Nice, that's a lot better. One thing I'd mention and it *should* be obvious is that you only need this in the situation where you need to mount your app code into your virtualized environment for development. You should confine all other data within the VM's local filesystem since you won't need write access to it within your host OS.
[02:03:17] <Byteflux> Stanley: I assume the way you've set it up is by mounting your code stored on macOS to your Ubuntu VM through some network share?
[02:03:27] <Stanley> haven't got that far yet actually
[02:03:30] <Stanley> lol
[02:03:42] <Stanley> UbuntuVM is on a totally different computer
[02:04:06] <Byteflux> Well I just mean things like MySQL or whatever you might use. Those things should be persisting directly to the VM's filesystem instead of over a virtual mount.
[02:04:24] <Stanley> I'm thinking the code might live on the ubuntuVM and I just have a fileshare setup that I can edit them remotely
[02:04:44] <Stanley> um
[02:04:52] <Stanley> not sure, i was going to let docker do it's thing for those
[02:05:26] <Stanley> oh I think I see what you're saying, yeah those would all live on the VM
[02:05:27] <Byteflux> Docker is running "natively" within the Ubuntu VM, yes?
[02:05:30] <Stanley> yes
[02:05:52] <Stanley> so essentially it's like my whole dev environment is in Ubuntu but instead of using that as my desktop i'll edit the files remotely
[02:06:04] <Byteflux> So yeah any persistent data volumes or bind mounts you have configured for your containers should be confined to the Ubuntu VM's filesystem and not over a mount.
[02:06:10] <Stanley> yup
[02:07:13] <Byteflux> If you wanted to take it a step further, you could also expose your Docker engine in Ubuntu VM over TCP, allowing you to use the docker commands from macOS to talk to your UbuntuVM :P
[02:07:26] <Stanley> oh man PHPStorm REALLY isn't happy with me opening up the remote project
[02:07:46] <Byteflux> PHPStorm is very terrible and has pretty much NO remote support.
[02:07:50] <Byteflux> I mean, it's a good IDE
[02:07:55] <Byteflux> But this is the one big area it lacks in.
[02:08:03] <Stanley> so this is all for moot
[02:08:09] <Stanley> VSCode better?
[02:08:17] <Byteflux> That's why you need to keep your code on macOS if you want to use PHPStorm
[02:08:20] *** Quits: freeworld (~vit@chello085216193138.chello.sk) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[02:08:37] <Byteflux> PHPStorm is capable of working with Docker containers, but the code itself has to live on the host OS
[02:08:45] <Byteflux> Otherwise the experience is terrible
[02:08:56] <Stanley> i mean phpstorm crashed so it's not just terrible it's impossible
[02:08:56] <Stanley> lol
[02:09:14] <Byteflux> If you want the code to live in the VM, there are still maybe some options...
[02:09:47] <Byteflux> With PHPStorm, you're stuck with either JetBrains Projector or running PHPStorm in the VM and having it render to a X display running on the host.
[02:10:08] <Byteflux> I have not tried either so can't really say what that's like.
[02:10:39] <Stanley> it seems like keeping the code on MacOS is pointless
[02:11:08] <Byteflux> It really depends what your threshold is for acceptable development app performance
[02:11:47] <Byteflux> This is only for the app itself, everything else can use Docker volumes and persist in the VM so database performance and such would not be affected by the same overhead.
[02:13:07] <Byteflux> Another option I came across, which might help with keeping the code on macOS, is mounting your code volume as a `cached` mount, like '.:/app:cached' (notice the :cached part)
[02:13:20] <Byteflux> No idea how much it would help, but supposedly it's good for macOS
[02:13:57] <Stanley> hmm
[02:14:08] <Byteflux> Going back to your question earlier about VSCode, yes they've nailed this down completely.
[02:14:26] <Byteflux> The experience working remotely with VSCode is lightyears ahead of PHPStorm.
[02:15:14] <Byteflux> But IMO it's still inferior in many ways and you'll ultimately have to spend time installing extensions, experimenting and seeing what works best for you...
[02:15:22] <Stanley> yeah
[02:15:27] <Stanley> i don't want to make anything to complex
[02:15:34] <Stanley> i'm coming from using Valet which was like, zero anything
[02:17:35] <Byteflux> You could try Projector, see if it's tolerable. https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/03/11/projector-is-out/
[02:17:43] <Byteflux> That is if you really want to keep your code in the VM
[02:17:58] <Stanley> yeah I think that's going to be the goal and have the best performance
[02:20:01] <Stanley> i'm going to keep working on getting the whole environment working properly and letting me view the sites remotely and then i'll worry about editing since i'm pretty confident that's solvable
[02:20:47] <Byteflux> At the end of the day after all this effort, hopefully you end up with a development environment that is quickly reproducible and as close to production as possible.

[02:23:07] <Stanley> using it on the ubuntu vm is a bit more of an experience too since there's no UI, heh

[13:03:56] <Stanley> TinoDidriksen long story but my primary dev machine runs MacOS and docker is pretty clunky on it
[13:04:28] <Stanley> so i installed a ubuntu vm on my unraid server and installed docker there
[13:04:53] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[13:04:53] <Stanley> first attempt was to have the code live on the VM which kind of worked except PHPStorm couldn't use the remote files without crashing
[13:05:03] <Stanley> i tried VSCode and it was a bit better but i hate VSCode
[13:05:29] <Stanley> I tried Jetbrains Projector but that was a bad experience
[13:05:37] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, remote sharing, not local docker -v
[13:05:51] <Stanley> so then the last ditch effort was to setup a file share on my macbook and mount it in the ubuntu VM and it was craaaaazy slow
[13:06:03] <Stanley> and with that I think i'm all out of options unfortunately
[13:06:03] *** Joins: onizu (uid373383@id-373383.highgate.irccloud.com)
[13:06:54] <TinoDidriksen> JetBrain's Projector is a weird thing. Just use built-in X forwarding.
[13:07:07] <biberu> Stanley: how did you attempt to share the files with phpstorm that caused it to crash?
[13:07:48] <Stanley> biberu the code was residing in a VM on my server and I was trying to open the project on my macbook over a fileshare
[13:08:03] <biberu> smb?
[13:08:06] <Stanley> yeah
[13:08:20] <biberu> odd that it'd crash on that
[13:08:31] <biberu> i guess you used smb in the other direction too?
[13:08:37] <Stanley> tried both yeah
[13:09:06] <biberu> what's crazy slow about it for that purpose? did you share e.g. node_modules or just some php source?
[13:10:17] <Stanley> well
[13:10:25] <Stanley> when the code was on the VM and I tried to open on my macbook it crashed
[13:10:45] <Stanley> the other option was the code lives on my macbook and on the VM I mount the macbook share and then tried to run docker from there
[13:11:02] <biberu> sure
[13:11:05] <Stanley> so from /mnt/macbook/project-name i ran docker
[13:11:17] <Stanley> and it was super slow to start and page loads were taking 4-5 seconds
[13:11:36] <biberu> is this a local vm?
[13:12:29] <Stanley> no
[13:12:35] <Stanley> the VM is running on my server
[13:12:41] <Stanley> it's on the local network though
[13:12:55] <biberu> right, that should be fine then
[13:14:09] <biberu> but it sounds like there's something other than share-to-docker-in-a-vm going on
[13:14:27] <Stanley> well i'm not really surprised it doesn't work well over the network
[13:15:35] <biberu> if you're using smb it's network even if it's local to your machine, and your lan shouldn't be that bad
[13:16:59] <biberu> Stanley: what if you use docker to share something straight from the vm, same issue?
[13:18:13] <Stanley> nope
[13:18:17] <Stanley> regular network access was fine
[13:18:33] <Stanley> my lans fine, i get transfers over 100MB/s
[13:18:54] <Stanley> but i think the issue is most likely the fact that the project is most lkely acecssing hundreds of small files
[13:19:05] <biberu> so if you have a simple page on the vm (e.g. only phpinfo), access it through docker, it loads quickly? but the same page shared to the vm via smb takes 4-5 seconds?
[13:19:55] <Stanley> honestly i'm not sure I didn't try with a simple page
[13:20:02] <Stanley> and i've already destroyed the whole setup
[13:20:03] <Stanley> haha

[17:20:32] <s17> my postman is free
[17:21:39] <Simplar> s17: you wrote Postman?
[17:21:56] <s17> no, I mean I haven't paid for it and it doesn't ask me for money
[17:22:02] <Simplar> It has limited request
[17:22:07] <s17> oh ok
[17:22:09] <Simplar> https://github.com/frigus02/RESTer I have found this thing
[17:22:14] <Simplar> it's a browser extension tho
[17:23:16] <Woet> uhh my postman has never mentioned anything about my requests
[17:23:21] <Woet> and i've done a few thousand at some points
[17:25:45] <Robdgreat> Woet: surely there are limitations, though
[17:25:52] <Woet> maybe for their premium services
