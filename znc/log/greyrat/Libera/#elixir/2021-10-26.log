[01:40:57] <synaps3> what is best way to setup elixir(+ phoenix) on Debian 11 ?
[01:43:43] <synaps3> The repository 'http://binaries.erlang-solutions.com/debian bullseye Release' does not have a Release file.
[01:43:56] <synaps3> how did you solve this, is it dangerous ?
[01:48:10] <rawtaz> looks like they havent got binaries for bullseye yet, if you look in that repository
[01:48:20] *** Quits: Guest43 (~Guest43@p200300c8cf2dff0069ff7208c1a11f02.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: Client closed)

[01:48:37] <synaps3> so if i change to last deb version i will be ok ?>
[01:48:46] <synaps3> wheezy instead of bullsseye
[01:49:02] <rawtaz> huh? the latest before bullseye was buster, no?
[01:50:03] <rawtaz> i honetly dont know if the buster packages work out of the box on bullseye. maybe :o
[01:50:18] <synaps3> buster my bad
[01:51:08] <synaps3> well it did the update
[01:51:29] <rawtaz> :)
[01:52:25] <synaps3> it works
[01:52:30] <synaps3> oh well
[01:52:37] <rawtaz> if it works it works :)
[01:54:40] <synaps3> any cool stuff in elixir ecosystem other than webdev ?
[01:54:45] <synaps3> i heard of elixir-nx
[01:55:53] <rawtaz> yeah that. and nerves-project.org
[01:56:15] <rawtaz> its not just web dev, you can use elixir for whatever system you want that doesnt have to do with web
[01:56:43] <synaps3> cool
[01:56:56] <rawtaz> very :)
[01:56:56] <synaps3> i was thinking about elixir in bioinformatcis
[01:57:02] <rawtaz> oh, can you elaborate?

[02:01:32] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[02:02:29] <synaps3> well just writing some libraries that can be used in bioinformatcis, python has a bunch so rewriting in elixir for start, i also saw some paper with sequencing genome with elixir and i'd try to implement it
[02:02:37] <synaps3> since i am interested in both
[02:03:11] <rawtaz> sounds like elixir could be a good fit for that type of work, indeed
[02:03:15] <rawtaz> processing stuff
[02:03:23] <synaps3> yeah
[02:03:49] <synaps3> i am much more new to bioinformatics than to programming
[02:04:40] <rawtaz> :)
[02:04:55] <rawtaz> why are you even into it? got a job involving it or are you studyig somthing?
[02:09:06] <synaps3> studying
[02:12:34] <rawtaz> i c
[02:13:50] <Guest43> for anyone who has implemented this, how did you implement a Team type schema, where members of a Team are allowed to access some other model/set of models?
[02:14:10] <synaps3> what are you doing with elixir rawtaz ?
[02:14:34] <Guest43> e.g. I have a Shop model, and i want to allow some employees to add/edit products in this Shop
[02:15:18] <rawtaz> synaps3: currently nothing :( i only did a couple of small things with it basically, never got the time to do something serious
[02:15:58] <rawtaz> Guest43: i havent done that in elixir/ecto/phoenix, but in general i would use RBAC for it
[02:18:36] <Guest43> rawtaz: thanks for the tip, i'll read up on it
[02:19:04] <Guest43> also, weren't you working on some elixir/phoenix sideproject recently? what happened to that?
[02:19:40] <rawtaz> oh yeah it's still lying here all dusty :)
[02:19:59] <Guest43> what was it again?
[02:20:20] <rawtaz> youre probably thinking about the parsing and presenting of flight information
[02:20:34] <Guest43> that's the one, why have you stopped developing it?
[02:21:25] <rawtaz> i just havent had time to work on it, thats all. nothing special at all :)
[02:21:30] <rawtaz> and it was just a hobby thing
[02:21:47] <rawtaz> i just run into stuff and problems to solve all the time so i never get to it
[02:21:53] <rawtaz> (most often caused by others!)
[02:23:19] <srfsh> Guest43: you can basically create a table that connects teams to members and check in your access-control code or similar whether the member is in the team through that table.  same for employees, but you can just have an can_access field there as well.
[02:28:58] <Guest43> srfsh: that would work, and how would you recommend normalizing those Team-related tables?
[02:29:36] <srfsh> Guest43: what do you mean by normalizing?
[02:30:40] <Guest43> srfsh: structuring the database so they conform to normal forms
[02:30:47] <Guest43> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization
[02:33:12] <Guest43> rawtaz: ah if it was just a little toy project then no big deal
[02:33:20] <srfsh> that really depends on your needs.
[02:34:40] <Guest43> srfsh: what is a general schema design that could be applied to a larger number of apps that require basic RBAC?
[02:35:25] <srfsh> i don't know.
[02:35:36] <Guest43> ok
[02:35:58] <srfsh> describe your problem in detail then we can think about solutions.  i don't know about a general solution.
[02:38:07] <Guest43> srfsh: ok i'll give an example, say you have an ecommerce platform where you can open multiple Shops. And you have several employees that you want to allow to create or edit products on these shops
[02:38:57] <Guest43> for example we have two shops, CopperKettlesInc and AntiqueStampCo
[02:39:09] <Guest43> i have 3 employees, A B and C
[02:39:53] <Guest43> i want to allow employees A and B to create or edit (but not delete) products on my CopperKettlesInc Shop, and i want to allow employee C to edit (but not create or delete) products on my AntiqueStampCo shop
[02:41:08] <rawtaz> on a general note, this is what i used when i did RBAC last time: https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/conference-paper/1992/10/13/role-based-access-controls/documents/ferraiolo-kuhn-92.pdf
[02:41:16] <rawtaz> i like that schema very much
[02:41:39] <rawtaz> i used it via the RBAC features in the php web framework named yii, which i liked a lot
[02:41:56] <rawtaz> (their implementation is based on this article, basically)
[02:42:16] <srfsh> Guest43: «shops» table, «employees» table, «shop_employee_access» (with the fields «shop_id», «employee_id», «can_create», «can_update», «can_delet») table.  if you have a match in «shop_employee_acess» table, the employee is allowed to do what can_* equals to true
[02:42:26] <Guest43> rawtaz: is that the original whitepaper?
[02:42:57] <rawtaz> you can read about the implementation/usage in that framework here: https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/security-authorization#rbac
[02:43:26] <rawtaz> Guest43: no idea, i just know it because they reference it in that last link i gave you above ^
[02:43:38] <Guest43> srfsh: what column type are the can_* columns?
[02:43:43] <rawtaz> i havent read the text, i just looked at the graphics :)
[02:43:58] <Guest43> rawtaz: i'm guessing it is, thanks for the link
[02:44:01] <srfsh> Guest43: boolean or int if it doesn't support.
[02:44:29] <rawtaz> Guest43: sure np. in the article there from yii they do talk about the schema and the four tables they use
[02:44:58] <Guest43> rawtaz: also yii, that brings back memories, that was one of the first frameworks i ever used
[02:45:10] <rawtaz> oh really? cool :)
[02:45:19] <rawtaz> its still the web one in php land i like the most, no doubt
[02:45:37] <Guest43> srfsh: makes sense, although FK'ing to a Role table allows a lot more flexibility i think
[02:45:39] <rawtaz> its such a sweet spot between pragmatism, convention over configuration, yet well defined api etc
[02:45:42] <rawtaz> i think its great
[02:46:01] <rawtaz> like elixir is :P
[02:46:04] <Guest43> rawtaz: do you develop in php at the moment?
[02:46:20] <rawtaz> only when i have to, e.g. i do client work. i dont write it myself for fun or anything
[02:46:22] <Guest43> laravel seems to be the most popular framework right now i think, never used it though
[02:46:33] <rawtaz> if i did, i would use yii. i know about and have used laravel and it's not my cup of tea
[02:46:37] <srfsh> Guest43: it all depends on your needs.  if it works for you, great.  ^^
[02:47:06] <rawtaz> yeah laravel is by far the most popular one i think. even mentioned or recommended by azure..
[02:47:39] <Guest43> appreciate the help srfsh, thanks
[02:49:43] <Guest43> personally i don't see much value in the php environment, doesn't really offer anything unique
[02:50:05] <Guest43> but it played an important role in the development of the web
[02:51:13] <rawtaz> yup
[02:51:42] <rawtaz> beditme, nite

I am writing a plug in which I want to make an http call to fetch a value from a remote and then store that value in the plugs state in order for any new request to use that value instead of re-fetching it. From what i understand, i should "use GenServer" from within my plug module and handle the state from there. Is this approach correct?

[15:38:22] <serafeim> hes
[15:38:26] <rawtaz> possibly h List
[15:38:32] <serafeim> should i Enum.find_index ?
[15:38:50] <Nicd> yes
[15:39:25] <rawtaz> was just about to say
[15:39:27] <rawtaz> :)
[15:40:03] <serafeim> ah ok thanks
[15:41:49] <rawtaz> [1,2,3] |> Enum.find_index(&(&1==2))
[15:45:06] <rawtaz> im just curious, is there anything shorter than that?
[15:45:16] <rawtaz> (besides skipping the pipe)

[15:56:40] <serafeim> only if you add an indexOf(l, el) function ... 
[15:57:09] <serafeim> but i presume that elixir doesn't want to do that to help users understand that this will be O(n)
[15:59:38] <rawtaz> well find_index is a more flexible variant of indexOf, so instead of having one for the basic use case and one for every other use case, why not just have the one that covers all use cases )
[15:59:43] <rawtaz> :)
[16:00:01] <serafeim> yes ok

[16:39:53] <Guest4341> what's the correct way of checking if an value exists in an array in ecto?
[16:40:27] <Guest4341> e.g. i want to query all Items that belong to all Catagory's belong to a User
[16:42:07] <Guest4341> would it be something like Item |> join(:left, [i], c in assoc(i, :category), on: [user_id: ^user_id]) |> where([i], i.store_id ?in? s.id)
[16:42:19] <Guest4341> not sure about that last part of the query
[16:49:12] <josevalim> you can try `i.store_id in s.id` but if doesn't work write a fragment query
[16:53:41] *** Quits: wonko (~wjc@62.115.229.50) (Quit: See You Space Cowboy..)
[16:53:54] <benwilson512> Guest4341: which of those columns is the array?
[17:01:40] <serafeim> hello friends. i am using the conn send_file() https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#send_file/5 to send back uploaded files to the user. however i have observed that these images are not cached. i.e the user's browsers wants to download them all the time. any way to improve that ? 
[17:02:42] <serafeim> i see the following header in the response `cache-control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate` 
[17:03:46] *** Joins: phaleth (~phaleth@user/phaleth)
[17:03:53] <serafeim> here https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#module-response-fields i see resp_headers - the response headers as a list of tuples, by default cache-control is set to "max-age=0, private, must-revalidate". Note, response headers are expected to have lowercase keys.
[17:05:02] <serafeim> would i need to add a cache-control header to my conn response by hand ? 
[17:06:50] <Guest4341> josevalim: thanks, i'll give that a try
[17:07:43] <Guest4341> benwilson512: ah sorry, it should be ... |> where([i], i.category_id ?in? c.id)
[17:08:17] <Guest4341> so the categories the user has created would be the array
[17:08:28] <Guest4341> e.g. [c1.id, c2.id, ...]

[17:19:11] <Guest4341> Items

[23:49:14] <serafeim> however, when i try the same code in production i do not see the exception but instead i get a 404 error! 
[23:49:18] <serafeim> any idea why ?
[23:49:46] <serafeim> is the exception handled somehow in the prod and return the 404 ?
[23:50:00] <whk> yes, it gets handled differently in prod. 
[23:51:10] <serafeim> whk: can you point me out where is that handler ?
[23:53:56] <serafeim> i guess it's here https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/custom_error_pages.html
