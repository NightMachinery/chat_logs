[00:07:27] <Betal> dagle: yea, but what I said about -bin is the general idea when you get upstream binaries and don't compile in the makepkg step

[00:10:27] <nfd> and the binary package ought to be separated from that in case you wanted a *different* scheme for some reason, and naming that binary package "texlive" would be misleading because users would just see "oh, a texlive package, i can install that and be good to go!" and miss fully most of the texlive environment

[02:22:55] <vtx> hi folks o/ i've recently ran into some frustrations with my desktop always going to sleep, and i eventually found out that this was likely down to my power manager. after investigating, i found that mate-power-manager was in fact correctly configured, but for some reason the configuration was being ignored, and my machine always went to sleep
[02:22:55] <vtx> after 15 minutes no matter what. i then uninstalled mpm and ever since my machine has been staying awake. it just got me to thinking, are power managers something a lot of folks use on their *desktops*? also, does anyone else find that any software in the "gnome" family is often buggy as hell?

[02:29:45] <nfd> i doubt my drive is faulty, i just failed to RTFM :D
[02:30:08] <arivigo> yeah, if it's ssd probably a config issue
[02:30:18] <kevr> nfd: In a lot of cases, you can usually tell if your drive is faulty through SMART tools. However, this is not always the case, as the values in drive firmware is up to the vendors to decide.
[02:30:31] <kevr> Nevertheless, it is a good thing to check, as usually there is a way to tell if the drive is bad.
[02:30:47] <kevr> Just make sure you check what the brand does for SMART by researching.
[02:31:13] <kevr> This can come in the form, normally, of error rates being above a particular threshold.

[13:05:43] <Tom^> because new enough cpu and uh 1650ti or 2xxx series this works wonders , it even gives you dynamic power management. once driver detects usage it powers on, once you close the application it powers it off etc

[16:23:10] <n00b101> I had a problem with grub that it was showing lockdown. I booted via live usb and reinstalled grub. But I did not generate a new grub cfg since partitions haven't changed. If I create new one, old dualboot will be gone.

[19:35:00] <duelle> Hello, I am trying to properly configure color profile for my screens. To do that, I created profiles using a color checker, but it seems like they are assigned in weird ways. I followed the guide from the ArchWiki for ICC profiles, but in the end 'darktable-cmstest reports different profiles: https://bpa.st/ZSGA How or where can I configure the
[19:35:00] <duelle> color profile for "X atom"?
[19:35:01] <phrik> Title: View paste ZSGA (at bpa.st)
[19:35:44] <duelle> For one of the profiles it seems to be the identical one (but is reported as different), and the other is not automatically assigned in X atom.. that's very confusing...

[22:00:26] <duelle> grawity The problem is that I currently use i3wm which (according to the docs in the ICC wiki page) does not work with the gnome-settings-daemon. 
[22:01:09] <duelle> grawity That's what I am trying. But I am not sure how to ensure that the right profile is applied. And the only tool I know is the mentioned darktable-cmstest which shows multiple settings that seem to conflict..
[22:03:01] <grawity> "how to ensure" you mean besides specifying it via colord and letting xiccd sync it to the Xserver?
