[23:54:15] <Ganneff> should do that way more often, it seems
[23:55:05] <anarcat> i have a systemd timer
[23:56:06] <Ganneff> i probably integrate it into my mail fetching monster of a script somewhere.
[23:57:05] <anarcat> well i don't do it *that* often
[23:57:33] <Ganneff> im not going to. probably a timestamp file in my maildir top folder, and then once a week (or month?)
[23:58:28] <anarcat> .config/systemd/user/notmuch-compact.timer says "monthly" here

[23:59:10] <Ganneff> hrm. from 13.X gb down to 6gb size for the db. useful
[23:59:26] <anarcat> which is interesting because that was december, not january
[23:59:34] <anarcat> some days i'm not a fan of systemd
[23:59:44] <anarcat> the thing said "monthly", what did you not get about "monthly"
[23:59:58] <bremner> january isn't over yet.
