[00:00:54] <CODECmadness> I better stop explaining it. I read myself and I don't know what I mean, too LOL
[00:02:58] <CODECmadness> So, if you can implement that in ffprobe along the road, that would be great! And for now, I suppose I must parse ffmpeg's output?
[00:03:40] <JEEB> I'm not sure if you noticed, but I'm trying to keep you from doing that :P
[00:03:53] <JEEB> so I could whip you a patch if you want one
[00:05:00] <CODECmadness> Just suppose I don't know what to do with a patch nor compile ffmpeg myself... ;(
[00:05:40] <CODECmadness> I just download binaries as they come out of the oven.

[00:28:20] <CODECmadness> OK. Thank you for your patience and your time, then! Could you maybe suggest those changes for future releases? I don't really know how... and as you've seen I may not be the best one to explain what is the "problem".
[00:29:00] <CODECmadness> I'll have to parse ffmpeg in the end, but at least now I know how to get the bit I need.
[00:29:02] <JEEB> I did already bring up on the -devel channel that it irritates me that we don't even have structure -> string|serialization done for side data
[00:29:32] <JEEB> I have a very long TODO list, but maybe one day I'll get to it or have someone else get the light in the light bulb
[00:30:05] <JEEB> since the current state where one module can make a string or serialization of a structure, but another cannot is just dumb
[00:31:15] <CODECmadness> I understand this is not exactly high priority, so I'll hope it gets done whenever is possible. Once again, thank you for having the patience to bear with me, and for the help you've provided me!
[00:31:22] <darsain> am I doing something wrong, or are the cbr values for libvpx and libvpx-vp9 so different? vp9 -cbr 10 produces 4 times bigger file than vp8 -cbr 10 ... what are the sane defaults for each? wiki doesn't touch on this, and docs don't even specify available ranges :(
[00:31:49] <JEEB> darsain: 100% up to libvpx itself, and it wouldn't be surprising if they changed a lot between VP8 and VP9 :)
[00:31:59] <JEEB> I think their documentation is still under webm.org or so?
[00:32:03] <darsain> *crf
[00:32:18] <JEEB> oh yea, and between vp8 and vp9 they switched the thing they map to "crf"
[00:32:25] <JEEB> in vp8 it was one thing, and vp9 it was another

[00:46:32] *** Joins: pong (~beaver@user/pong)
[00:47:03] <JEEB> at the end of the day it just means that the answers for "why higher CRF for lower res" most likely can be found on the libvpx side :)
[00:47:38] <JEEB> it could either be that they reversed the quantizer numbering (unlikely) or because they decided that lower res stuff is just less important if you also provide higher res versions
[00:48:00] <JEEB> as in, they're not even trying to do similar perceived quality levels between resolutions :)

[13:04:48] <darsain> I'm using "-progress pipe:1" to get a machine readable progress reporting into stdout stream, but what I'm getting there seems buggy
[13:04:55] <darsain> these are the time values I'm interested in as they are reported: out_time_us=2760078, out_time_ms=2760078, out_time=00:00:02.760078
[13:05:27] <darsain> and the out_time_ms is the same as out_time_us, but it should be 1000 times smaller
[13:06:34] <darsain> is this a bug, or am I missing something?
[13:09:00] <darsain> found this https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7345 which says it was fixed 3 years ago, but I'm on 4.4 and have this issue

[14:07:42] <aphysically> huh
[14:07:57] <aphysically> using -progress with output to stderr seems to completely break things on my windows build
[14:14:55] <aphysically> yeah I guess -progress just seems to really completely break the python stdout/stderr processing for some reason if I try to output to pipe:1 or pipe:2
[14:15:18] <aphysically> not sure what's going on there, but I guess I can try separating it out and using its own pipe?

[14:59:01] <aphysically> it looks like using "-" instead of pipe:1 might be working
[14:59:07] <aphysically> is there something similar to "-" for stderr?
[15:01:09] <furq> are you silencing all the other stderr output
[15:03:21] <aphysically> I *was* silencing stdout and sending everything to stderr, but even capturing both wasn't working
[15:03:34] <aphysically> it worked for me but it broke for my friends' windows machine
[15:03:37] <aphysically> no idea what's going on
[15:04:24] <aphysically> it breaks for me on linux if I try to do pipe:1 and combine the stderr/stdout in python
[15:05:17] <aphysically> errr, no
[15:05:55] <aphysically> honestly I have no idea what's happening, it works for me on linux but it's breaking for my compiled windows builds when I do -progress outputs to pipe:1 or 2 or -
[15:06:30] <aphysically> maybe it just doesn't work on windows/I need to use its own dedicated named pipe
[15:07:02] <aphysically> but at this point the -progress output is less machine readable than regex parsing the human readable output in the first place, so I'm just going back to that :P
[15:09:02] <aphysically> wait a sec

[19:53:47] <CODECmadness> This sintax allows me to dump the info I need, though I have to parse differently as it isn't a "normal" ffprobe result.
[19:54:39] <CODECmadness> Thanks for the help. It led me to try different formulas, and this one worked.
