[07:56:42] <cluelessperson> Fiji, reddit is a cesspool, the admins are total sellouts, and they ban people for perfectly legal chat
[07:57:20] <Fiji> i hpoe they ban me, i just spent like 2 hours arguing with a moron who thinks all time zones are in 1 hour increments and refuses to look at a time zone map
[07:57:34] <Fiji> also they can ban for whatever they want, they're a company lol
[07:57:57] <cluelessperson> Fiji, try discussing the philosophy of whether or not to kill the super rich, and you'll get banned for "glorifying violence"
[07:58:21] <cluelessperson> but if you actually read the rules, it's not remotely against the rules.
[07:58:22] <Fiji> i just called the guy a stupid cunt
[07:58:38] <Fiji> i will say i dont generally talk about killing people though because i dont like the concept
[07:59:17] <cluelessperson> Fiji, Which is a good moral standing, but it makes you easy to victimize.
[08:00:30] <cluelessperson> The point is that if billionaires buy law, the only way to stop them is with violence.
[08:01:18] <cluelessperson> At least enough violence to break their stranglehold so that actual democracy can work
[08:02:57] <cluelessperson> None of this is remotely unlawful to talk about,  referring to Brandenburg V. Ohio with the Supreme Court,  in which a man literally stood on a podium  in front of congress and called for the assassination of much of congress in front of a mob.   He was ultimately found not guilty and a test was formed to establish the limit of free speech.
[08:03:54] <Fiji> i mean its a private company
[08:04:07] <Fiji> the speech is legal but they can ban whatever user they want for whatever reason lol

[08:04:29] <cluelessperson> thief!
[08:04:58] <Fiji> :)
[08:05:14] <cluelessperson> Fiji, yes, reddit is a private company that can basically do whatever they want on their private servers.... UNTIL they become the equivalent of a public service at which point they should be required to follow public regulation like any utility.
[08:05:39] <cluelessperson> Fiji, and frankly, seeing as how they call themselves the "front page of the internet", I think they should be regulated like a public utility.
[08:05:39] <Fiji> i dont think any internet company save google's search features is at that level yet tbh
[08:05:56] <Fiji> i don't think so because i think that tagline was just making fun of digg's tagline
[08:06:31] <cluelessperson> Fiji, I disagree.    Google search (clearly),  Facebook (tracking relationships),   Reddit (self-admitted front page of the internet),  Youtube (by far the most common video sharing site)
[08:07:21] <cluelessperson> The problem is that internet access itself isn't even regulated as a public utility (in the states)
[08:07:24] <Fiji> u saying pornhub isnt a public utility?
[08:07:42] <cluelessperson> so declaring these companies public utilities is another step further.
[08:08:04] <cluelessperson> Fiji, No, because pornhub doesn't insert itself to control communication of millions of people.
[08:08:11] <cluelessperson> millions, sorry BILLIONS.
[08:08:11] <Fiji> i value phub over fb tbh
[08:08:33] <Fiji> it doesnt control my communications at all
[08:08:34] <cluelessperson> Amazon!
[08:08:50] <cluelessperson> Amazon's logistics should be seriously regulated and taken over by government, for example.
[08:09:05] <Fiji> u some kind of commie bro?
[08:09:19] <Fiji> if u were in the USA u would be a commie
[08:14:34] <cluelessperson> Fiji, What I describe is not at all communist.
[08:15:54] <cluelessperson> Fiji, A government is supposed to protect and serve its people,  that means protecting its people from organizations seeking to abuse those people,  and also taking control of organizations that grow to the point that the people depend on them.
[08:15:58] <Fiji> kill the bourgeois, take control of private sector companies... smells mighty like the bolshevik revolution in here
[08:16:08] <Fiji> or maybe that's me becuase i didn't shower today...
[08:17:02] <cluelessperson> Fiji, bourgeois are upper middle class.   I'm talking about those that own or control companies that threaten the people and our government.
[08:17:16] <Fiji> just takin the piss m8 :P
[08:18:05] <Fiji> i dont know if the companies should be regulated as public utilities because i dont think the companies are inherently necessary to daily life. i think what needs to be regulated are their anti-competitive practices
[08:18:20] <cluelessperson> Fiji, sure,  but even if the originating goal of Amazon wasn't to become a mafia, they are one now, and they wield power they shouldn't have.
[08:18:26] <Fiji> google et. al. should NOT be buying up every startup with the goal of taking over entire industries or preventing any industries from growing
[08:18:31] <cluelessperson> pretty sure everyone can agree to that.
[08:19:12] <Fiji> well, amazon is only a mafia because they have 0 guard rails in this stupid country, if there were any it would cripple their size (hopefully)
[08:19:22] <cluelessperson> Fiji, the problem is that you get people claiming that amazon is a "business that works hard to earn money"
[08:19:37] <cluelessperson> and sure, at some point they might have, but now they bully local governments into evading their taxes.
[08:19:53] <Fiji> the problem with what?
[08:20:18] <cluelessperson> For example, Amazon negotiated a tax cut to be in an area.   Okay, fine, the people's government can determine that.
[08:20:38] <Fiji> well i dont think that should be negotiated either for multi-state affairs actually
[08:21:00] <cluelessperson> but then amazon declined to pay their taxes, that had already been cut down.
[08:21:20] <cluelessperson> and when the local government threatened to fine / force them, amazon threatens to move its business to another locality.
[08:21:26] <cluelessperson> Literal tax evasion and extortion.
[08:21:40] <Fiji> yeah cuz theyre a bunch of buttholes and they know that local governments are run by morons who can only envision the next election cycle and no further than that in terms of long term planning
[08:21:58] <cluelessperson> Which are crimes, but the local governments don't have the balls to arrest amazon execs and such.
[08:22:28] <cluelessperson> So, the community contract breaks down completely.
[08:22:48] <cluelessperson> This company is wielding power that it can break the law, and the government can't or won't hold them responsible.
[08:23:18] <Fiji> seems like an enforcement problem
[08:23:20] <cluelessperson> Which is where I start to prescribe violence, at least enough to remove the executives that commit these crimes on Amazon's top level.
[08:23:34] <Fiji> if the feds gave two shits or we had a stronger fed system this would not be a problem
[08:23:55] <cluelessperson> Sure, but we don't, and you can't outvote corruption.
[08:24:11] <Fiji> amazon is just taking advantage of the decentralized nature of some aspects of US governance and there are 2 possible solutions... 1) centralize more... 2) prevent them from being able to take advantage of it through changing laws
[08:24:13] <cluelessperson> Yes, violence is messy.  It sucks.  It should be a last resort.
[08:24:30] <cluelessperson> But when peaceful options are taken off the table, that's what you get.
[08:24:55] <Fiji> you don't outvote corruption, you get the right people to throw them in jail, of which there are no people that are able to do so from years of crippled law enforcement budgets against white collar crimes
[08:24:59] <cluelessperson> What's horrifying, is that usually the first ones to turn to violence are misinformed idiots being indoctrinated against their interests.
[08:25:10] <cluelessperson> Smarter people well... are usually smart enough to not get that desperate.
[08:25:37] <Fiji> "we live in a society..."
[08:26:16] <cluelessperson> So basically, the most wealthy are squeezing us to the point that violence is becoming the only logical conclusion to counter them
[08:26:46] <cluelessperson> Faux News was literally talking on air about driving people to starvation to force them to work.
[08:27:20] <cluelessperson> Fiji, how are you anyway?
[08:28:04] <Fiji> i dont think we need to eat them, i do think we need to do something drastic (like seize all their assets and start busting the companies up and get the people working at those companies into unions)
