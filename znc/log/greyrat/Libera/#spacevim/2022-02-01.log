[06:24:09] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> I don't think so (re @SpaceVimBot: erayaydin: Hi, It's look like SpaceVim will not follow XDG base directory specs.  Are there any fork of SpaceVim which following XDG?)

[22:47:20] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> Thank you very much for the reply! I save the file and it gives me some compiling errors saying that some classes are not recognized. I checked those classes and found that they are the classes under the same package. Do you have a solution to this?
[22:48:45] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> I am also wondering how to use spacevim to manage projects. The documentation says to use denite layer for finding the root of the project and it works for me. but the spacevim still could not run the main function of my application since it does not recognize the classes in the same package as i described above.
