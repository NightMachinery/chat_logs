[00:17:46] <catern> i'm increasingly skeptical of the "actually ideas are worth nothing" narrative
[00:18:58] <catern> since it seems like people rarely talk about most of the ideas I have - but they seem so intuitive and obvious to me, so maybe I'm even just hallucinating when I think people are talking about the ideas I have
[00:19:44] <catern> (on the other hand, I guess my ideas can be novel *and* worth nothing)

I think I can add an additional annotation field for 'tags', and to define/render the tags, overload the directory indexes: the paths are tags, like 'psychology/writing', 'statistics', 'statistics/bias' etc, and annotations with tags get inlined into...
[00:48:37] <gwern> ...the directory index page; files in the directory automatically get that directory as a tag to save writing. popups then read another ${dataset.tags} span, and provide links to the directory indexes. so for some arxiv link with the tag 'ai', the popup goes, "['Research Paper'](arxiv/abs/1234), X, Y, Z (2021-01-01; [ai](/docs/ai/index), ..." and then that's repeated inside...

[03:22:55] <Betawolf> sadly, there are 'measure becomes target' issues
[03:23:17] <saturn2> just bring a shopping cart with you and leave it in front of the target person
[03:24:14] <gwern> kuudes: is that the old bogus one?
[03:25:22] <kuudes> wait, what?
[03:26:18] <kuudes> don't us shop carts take in a coin to free them for use?
[03:26:34] <ggreer> no. they're just sitting at the front of the store
[03:26:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: I've thought about this, actually. And what I wonder is: is it, actually, right to return the shopping cart? I mean, you don't want to leave it where it'll block vehicular traffic or take up a parking spot. But what makes it right to return it to where you got it?
[03:26:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like ... that's the staff's job, right?
[03:26:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> They do get paid for doing these things
[03:27:01] <kuudes> over here they are chained to other shopping carts and have a lock that opens when you push in 50 cent coin. you get the coin back when you reconnect the lock
[03:27:03] <ggreer> staff have to do it because people sometimes don't return them
[03:27:10] <gwern> kuudes: depends. Aldi's makes a point of doing the coin thing
[03:27:18] <ggreer> who the hell has coins?
[03:27:40] <gwern> ggreer: not as many people as used to, so you sometimes see people going in to get quarters from the cashiers at Aldi...
[03:27:43] <kuudes> you can buy coin-like polett thingy which fits into that if you prefer such, and then keep that with your keys
[03:28:05] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: also you don't have to put it back where you got it. you just have to put it back in one of those corrals in the parking lot
[03:28:08] <kuudes> like, the point is not to make money with it but remind people to return the carts
[03:28:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: In my experience, there's two kinds of stores. In one, there's shopping cart docks scattered throughout the parking lot. Some people (including me) take the time to put the cart in the nearest such dock; others do not.
[03:28:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Other stores have no such docks. In such cases, no one ever returns shopping carts, ever.

He painted, often in tempera, coastal views, abstracts, portraits and still-life. He was also an engraver on wood and copper. …)

[04:08:37] <Robomot> Vorticism - Wikipedia (Vorticism was a London-based modernist art movement formed in 1914 by the writer and artist Wyndham Lewis. The movement was partially inspired by Cubism and was introduced to the public by means of the publication of the Vorticist manifesto in Blast magazine. Familiar forms of representational art were rejected in favour of a geometric style that tended towards a hard-edged abstraction. …)
[04:09:32] <gwern> does explain why the dropcaps are so sketchy and engravy
[04:09:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "His fellow vorticist Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was killed at the front and Bomberg and Lewis found that their belief in the purity of the machine age was seriously challenged by the realities of the trenches."
[04:09:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Wadsworth spent the war in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on the island of Mudros until invalided out in 1917, transferring dazzle camouflage designs onto allied ships.[6][7] Known as Dazzle ships, these vessels were not camouflaged to become invisible, but instead used ideas derived from Vorticism and Cubism to confuse enemy U-boats trying to pinpoint the direction and speed of travel.[8]"

[05:10:36] <PlanckWalk> Ah, so in the analogy you'd have an adapter.
[05:11:01] <ggreer> ideally everyone would use the tesla connector since it's the smallest. its only disadvantage is that it's 440V. some newer CCS standards allow 880V charging
[05:12:29] <PlanckWalk> Are charging stations mostly owned by manufacturers at the moment?
[05:12:33] <ggreer> there are adapters for pretty much any combo, but they usually charging rates
[05:12:41] <PlanckWalk> (As in the actually useful high-power ones)
[05:12:43] <ggreer> no. tesla's the only one that owns their own charging network

[05:23:29] <ggreer> my car shows watt-hours per mile. I think over the car's entire lifetime (15000ish miles) it's averaged 275wh/mi. I drive the hell out of it though
[05:24:03] <PlanckWalk> 275 W-hr/mi looks like ~600 N
[05:24:44] <PlanckWalk> I must have messed up somewhere
[05:25:14] <PlanckWalk> Oh I see, kW-hr = 3.6 MJ, not 1 MJ :)
[05:25:15] <ggreer> yeah. 90kwh / 270 miles == 333Wh/mi
[05:25:37] <ggreer> the model 3 is lighter than the S so it tends to get better efficiency

The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof. …)
[10:41:17] <rmmh> right, the wiki article suggests you combine a piezo switch with a trnasistor
[10:41:41] <Logos01> The piezoelectric medium would be the transistor in what I'm talking about.
[10:44:23] <Logos01> You would need some electromechanical method of applying the pressure to the piezoelectric medium to get it to change potential and thus act as the transistor, yeah, but since you need very little actual mechanical energy to accomplish that for a given transistor element you could use much smaller mechanisms with lower energy requirements.
[10:47:30] <Logos01> It would have been a more performant form of relay switching I guess.  But then again nobody really knew about or very well understood piezoelectricity then.

A nice thing about Purelymail and Migadu is that they are cheaper for multiple custom domains, and I am price-sensitive.
[18:04:47] <mst> dbohdan: price is a reasonable reason; I mention those two because I've got drunk with both of their technical teams and trust them to know their stuff

[19:37:00] <mst> my trick is, you see the pager thing in the bottom right
[19:37:06] <spxtr> ye
[19:37:12] <mst> I have 3x3 of my screen size there
[19:37:30] <mst> but instead of distinct desktops, it's one giant one that I have a viewport onto
[19:37:55] <mst> so e.g. if I find a particular task is overflowing four terminals, I can just scroll a bit and borrow the left-hand pair from the 'screen' to the right
[19:38:17] <spxtr> oh nice
[19:38:42] <mst> fvwm2 is not a tiling window manager, my xterms are created pre-tiled by a script
[19:39:01] <mst> gives me a bit more flexibility given my prefered workflow
[19:39:53] <spxtr> even after several months with it, I'm not 100% sold on tiling wm on an ultrawide monitor
[19:40:43] <spxtr> if I spawn a regular window on its own then it takes up the entire screen, not usually what I want
[19:41:10] <mst> I also use focus follows mouse so I can just throw the pointer over where I want typing to go
[19:41:19] <spxtr> yeah same, that's nice
[19:41:27] <mst> then I have keyboard shortcuts
[19:41:37] <mst> Ctrl-<arrow> moves one whole screen
[19:42:05] <mst> Ctrl-Shift-<arrow> moves ... it's about 45% of a screen, basically the goal is "move the pointer around between the four terminals on screen at the time"
[19:42:55] <mst> so I can navigate spatially except only ever use the mouse for X selection
[19:44:04] <spxtr> I just use standard dwm keybinds for the most part.
[19:44:30] <spxtr> btw one behavior not shown is that notifications show up in the center of the top bar, so it's not wasted space
[19:44:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: That's a pretty cool setup
[19:45:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can you zoom out and such?
[19:45:37] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: no, but I can't say I've ever wanted that
[19:47:29] <mst> I already have in my head what each cluster-of-four is doing because remembering spatial relations is easy (this is why I enjoyed discussing the finder stuff)
[19:47:49] <mst> if I zoomed out I'd end up with text too small to read
[19:47:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> True
[19:48:01] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: one thing I like about my link tag proposal is that it's another demonstration of how flexible files + popups is as a paradigm. hardly any additional coding, and it Just Works
[19:48:05] <mst> whereas with my keybindings I can bounce around the screens at high speed
[19:48:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ok, so now that I have a bit of time - explain to me what the point of this is
[19:48:50] <mst> like I can do Ctrl-<right>,<down>,<left>,<up> to skim a cluster of four clusters in 2-3 seconds, and that's way more useful than a zoomed out view of them would be to me
[19:49:20] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: like, tags? or tags as applied to annotations specifically?
[19:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> The latter
[19:49:36] <dbohdan> gwern: Well, the reduced-capitalization macOS does contain more free code than the full-capitalization Mac OS did.  If there is ever a "macos", we'll see how that affects it.
[19:50:49] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: rn there's an imbalance and bias in how links are treated. if I host a PDF about GPT, you can go to /docs/ai/gpt/index and see all such PDFs in one place, and read "all PDFs gwern tags as ai/gpt related". but only if I *host* that file. if it's an Arxiv paper, then it's not in the list, no matter how relevant.

[19:54:27] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: note that if e.g. I'm doing a server migration, I'll often have the top-left cluster open on IRC and email and possibly other bits, then the one to the right having four terminals onto the old system, then the one below that four terminals onto the new system, then the one immediately below the top left actually doing stuff

[21:17:46] <two2thehead> have a feep +1 for motivation
[21:17:52] <feep> YOU ARE NOT HELPING
[21:18:22] <two2thehead> sorry
[21:18:25] <feep> ;.;
[21:18:47] <two2thehead> Is there anything I can say to make you feel better? :-)
[21:18:50] <feep> literally
[21:18:52] <feep> nothin g
[21:18:59] <two2thehead> oh well.
[21:19:11] <two2thehead> let me know if you need some moral support I guess
[21:19:12] <mst> two2thehead: this isn't actually funny. stop it please.
[21:19:22] <Logos01> ggreer: Just stainless steel will do that.
[21:19:48] <Betawolf> I don't understand what's going on here, is feep testing a bot and wants the entire channel to be quiet?
[21:19:56] <feep> can ya'll please shut up for literally one minute
[21:20:05] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:20:07] <ggreer> he said something something stainless steel. I was kinda distracted because right before that he was talking about how he broke his back last year
[21:20:15] <ggreer> like literally broke it and lost 3 inches in height
[21:20:32] <nshepperd2> just test it on another channel lol
[21:20:38] <feep> it's hardcoded
[21:20:47] <Betawolf> code harder
[21:20:48] <mst> right, fuckit, let's give feep a minute
[21:20:50] <nshepperd2> unhardcode it
[21:21:03] <Logos01> ggreer: I mean it seems weird to use stainless steel for irrigating piping when you could just use a pipelining.

[21:22:04] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Nearly 50 years ago, Intel created the world’s first commercially produced microprocessor—the 4004 (ref. 1), a modest 4-bit CPU (central processing unit) with 2,300 transistors fabricated using 10 μm process technology in silicon and capable only of simple arithmetic calculations. Since this ground-breaking achievement, there has been continuous technological
[21:22:04] <feepbot> development with increasing sophistication to the stage where state-of-the-art silicon 64-bit microprocessors now have 30 billion transistors (for example, the AWS Graviton2 (ref. 2) microprocessor, fabricated using 7 nm process technology). The microprocessor is now so embedded within our culture that it has become a meta-invention—that is, it is a tool that allows other
[21:22:04] <feepbot> inventions to be realized, most recently enabling the big data analysis needed for a COVID-19 vaccine to be developed in record time. Here we report a 32-bit Arm (a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture) microprocessor developed with metal-oxide thin-film transistor technology on a flexible substrate (which we call the PlasticARM). Separate from the mainstream
[21:22:09] <feepbot> semiconductor industry, flexible electronics operate within a domain that seamlessly integrates with everyday objects through a combination of ultrathin form factor, conformability, extreme low cost and potential for mass-scale production. PlasticARM pioneers the embedding of billions of low-cost, ultrathin microprocessors into everyday objects.'

[21:23:07] <spxtr> what material is normally used for irrigation? I thought some form of stainless steel would be completely normal
[21:23:10] <feep> I set it to ten minutes now
[21:23:10] <feepbot> Executable reloaded at request of feep, 4 times on this connection. 
[21:23:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Logos01: The robot uprising has begun
[21:23:17] <Logos01> Obormot\Arcturus: Apparently.
[21:23:21] <mst> ggreer: I agree, but two2thehead wouldn't stop being a knob and I ran out of patience
[21:23:21] <ggreer> Logos01: I'm not a fire expert. probably some random building code requires metal
[21:23:24] <feep> Logos01: okay, so what's happening is
[21:23:33] <feep> gwern often spams gwernpastes in the middle of conversations, this is clearly suboptimal
[21:23:39] <feep> now gwern can instead *queue* gwernpastes
[21:23:41] <feep> with feepbot
[21:23:46] <Betawolf> no, this is desired behaviour
[21:23:48] <Logos01> ggreer: Oh no, you can use metal pipes and then just have them lined on the inside with some material.
[21:23:51] <feep> and they will be printed when the channel is quiet
[21:23:58] <Logos01> ggreer: That's done *all the time*.
[21:24:04] <two2thehead> hmm
[21:24:05] <gwern> (and I can still gwernpaste normally during dumb convos to break them up)
[21:24:08] <Betawolf> has gwern committed to use this feature?
[21:24:08] <feep> :)
[21:24:24] <ggreer> wouldn't the lining melt in high temps? or fuck with the water in the pipe? I don't know
[21:24:33] <gwern> Betawolf: of course not. maybe it's a bad idea. but I won't know until I've tried it for a few days, at least
[21:25:00] <dbohdan> gwern: Oh no, now you gwernpasting manually will signal that the conversation is dumb -- ambiguously
[21:25:03] <Logos01> ggreer: Not all linings are made equal, but polyethelene is used as tubing for outdoor drip irrigation systems, for example, and is a perfectly valid liner.
[21:25:14] <spxtr> worth noting that most irrigation lines are in the ground, which generally stays pretty cool compared to the air
[21:25:20] <Logos01> ggreer: And a lot of liners are sufficiently chemically neutral that they can be used as liner for sewer piping.
[21:25:22] <spxtr> especially since they're water cooled :)
[21:25:24] <ggreer> yes but for fire suppression you probably want stuff that can survive a fire
[21:25:43] <gwern> dbohdan: or that it's important news or I want to discuss it immediately or something! thereby preserving vital strategic ambiguity, as is my right as an american
[21:25:59] <spxtr> in that case who cares if the lining fails?
[21:26:02] <feep> the thing about how messy and hacked up feepbot is, I can hack a feature like that in in maybe twenty minutes or so, which is nbd
[21:26:06] <gwern> to own and operate Weapons of Mass Distraction, as guaranteed by the 2nd amendment
[21:26:07] <feep> maybe gwern will use it, maybe not
[21:26:14] <ggreer> spxtr: it could fail by clogging the sprinkler
[21:26:24] <spxtr> I suppose that's reasonable
[21:26:37] <dbohdan> gwern: Illegibility, as American as [redacted] pie
[21:26:55] <feep> in the meantime, I enjoy feeling useful~
[21:27:07] <two2thehead> :-)

[21:27:29] <catern> I love getting dukka things from middle eastern places; love 2 eat suffering fries
[21:27:40] <Logos01> "Thermoplastic pipes now dominate residential and light-hazard categories"
[21:27:57] <gwern> fries are inherently buddhist, as their pleasure is transient and they rapidly congeal in deeply dissatisfying grease-piles
[21:28:13] <spxtr> isn't thermoplastic literally the opposite of what you want in a fire?
[21:28:33] <spxtr> owing to what ggreer mentioned, if it gets warm it might block the lines?
[21:28:35] <pompolic> does that imply that every belgian has the Buddha nature?
[21:28:58] <gwern> pompolic: given their lack of accomplishment, they're clearly doing a good job of eradicating desire
[21:29:12] <Logos01> ggreer: Could the word you're forgetting have been "galvanized" ?
[21:31:05] <spxtr> I think you don't use galvanized steel for pipes anymore
[21:31:08] <spxtr> it rusts eventually
[21:32:00] <Logos01> spxtr: https://www.wheatland.com/products/fire-sprinkler-pipe/gl-galvanized
[21:32:01] <Robomot> GL Galvanized Fire Sprinkler Pipe | Wheatland Tube (Learn about Wheatland Tube’s GL Galvanized fire sprinkler pipe, made in the USA for branch line use in exposed, open areas.)
[21:33:22] <Logos01> spxtr: Stainless steel seems to largely get used for sanitary rated piping, which fire sprinkler systems are not.
[21:33:30] <spxtr> oh that makes sense I guess
[21:34:26] <Logos01> Apparently the spec still allows the use of "black steel" piping for fire solutions as well, which is even less long-term corrosion resistant than galvanized steel.
[21:34:28] <spxtr> I know it's used for electrical conduits in our building
[21:34:42] <Logos01> Since it's basically just regular steel with a coating of black rust.
[21:35:16] <spxtr> probably just used because stainless is expensive?
[21:35:34] <Logos01> Black steel is cheaper than galvanized, galvanized is cheaper than stainless.
[21:35:40] <Logos01> So yes.
[21:35:45] <spxtr> makes sense
[21:36:07] <Logos01> And in home and commercial office areas it looks like they straight up use plastic nowadays.
[21:36:34] <Logos01> So it's only for "high-hazard" and exposed locations that you even see proper steel most of the time.
[21:36:46] <mst> I spent about $6k getting the cast iron guttering on my flat replaced with new cast iron
[21:36:53] <mst> plastic would've been about $1k
[21:37:04] <mst> but I bought this place because I loved the aesthetic
[21:37:22] <Logos01> I haven't even begun to think about the raingutters for my house.
[21:37:31] <mst> plastic gutters on an old building would've just been missing the point
[21:37:44] <Logos01> But yeah I definitely need to set up a side account and once a year do some project to improve the place.
[21:38:29] <Logos01> This year's thing will be fixing up the heating/cooling situation. Next year's will be fixing the wiring situation. Year after that will be xeriscaping.
[21:38:49] <Logos01> Dunno what I'll do the year after that. Maybe reshingle the exterior.
[21:38:59] <Logos01> Or resurface the hardwood flooring.

[21:56:12] *** Joins: Fusxfaranto (~Fusxfaran@cpe-75-85-179-208.san.res.rr.com)
[21:57:17] <galambo_> I am reading lifecycle investing, which proposes diversifying assets over time by being extremely aggressive leveraging early in your career when you don't have much money, and then gradually becoming more conservative
[21:57:41] <kuudes> yes
[21:57:43] <galambo_> they say anybody starting or early in their career should be on the s&p 500 leveraged x2
[21:57:58] <kuudes> that is indeed in line with some presumptions
[21:58:07] <galambo_> but then they recommend avoiding the stock market if the PE ratio is high
[21:58:38] <galambo_> thats one issue. I dont know what to make of this
[21:58:40] <galambo_> another issue
[21:59:52] <galambo_> (and I did mention this before and discussed it a bit with linear) metaculus predicts very high returns for tech stocks if even weak AGI arrives by 2040 (and metaculus thinks AGI WILL probably arrive by 2040): https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7506/return-for-vgt-if-agi-arrives-by-2040/

[22:00:28] <Robomot> What annual real return will the S&P 500 realize 2022-2031? | Metaculus
[22:00:33] <galambo_> but the s&p 500 is mostly technology
[22:00:43] <galambo_> also isnt the free lunch in investing diversification?
[22:00:47] <galambo_> so what should I do now
[22:00:48] <galambo_> ?
[22:01:48] <galambo_> leverage? avoid the stock market? diversify across the world because thats the free lunch of investing? or just put all my money in tech stocks? or avoid the stock market altogether because the PE ratios are high?
[22:03:57] <catern> stop thinking
[22:04:07] <catern> buy VTSAX
[22:04:30] <galambo_> catern, well I am 100% S&P 500 now which I think is a good compromise between all these very conflicting thoughts
[22:04:44] <galambo_> warren buffett likes the s&p 500
[22:04:46] <catern> okay, as long as you aren't thinking
[22:04:46] <galambo_> low fees
[22:04:50] <galambo_> biased toward tech
[22:04:50] <dbohdan> Deleting episodes of _Tidying Up with Marie Kondo_ is kind of funny

[22:05:40] <feep> I will say this is terrible advice and you should invest against it
[22:05:43] <feep> imo
[22:05:47] <galambo_> catern, but I cant stop thinking. 15.5% returns per year from tech stocks is a lot
[22:05:53] <feep> because if we get AGI we get the singularity, and what does money avail us then?
[22:05:57] <galambo_> feep, I remember reading on lw about AI winter
[22:05:59] <gwern> dbohdan: rewatches don't spark joy, huh
[22:06:08] <feep> galambo_: nono, from a hedging perspective
[22:06:10] <Gurkenglas> i wonder how possible it is to take a pdf and remove every row or column that is completely white. ideally without hurting metadata what powers Ctrl-F
[22:06:13] <feep> never invest in an outcome that destroys the market.
[22:06:27] <catern> galambo_: exactly, that's your problem - stop thinking! or, if you have to think and have to feel superior to others - then think about the outside view!
[22:06:47] <feep> but yes, the reflective advice I'd give is stop thinking & vanguard
[22:07:19] <galambo_> feep, before AGI swoops the world, there will probably lots of advances that dramatically improve the global GDP and people will speculate
[22:07:33] <feep> galambo_: yeah but then you have lots of money for a year or two
[22:07:45] <feep> and then one way or another, the market ends
[22:07:47] <feep> this is not good retirement saving :p
[22:07:54] <catern> you're already long AGI techno-utopia by being human
[22:07:56] <galambo_> feep, I am selfish
[22:08:03] <galambo_> feep, but 15%!
[22:08:09] <Gurkenglas> feep, having 40% of the world's money right before foom might well give you influence on, like, whether it fooms
[22:08:20] <dbohdan> gwern: Deleting them because you know you are not going to rewatch them soon feels so *right*
[22:08:21] <feep> Gurkenglas: sure but that's not actionable as a private investor
[22:08:23] <catern> if anything, you need to hedge against it not happening
[22:08:28] <feep> galambo_: nono, definitely go for it
[22:08:33] <feep> just not on the basis of agi outcomes :p
[22:08:38] <gwern> dbohdan: "You have learned your lessons well, grasshopper. I have nothing more to teach you."
[22:08:59] <galambo_> catern, or I could use my profits to fund AI safety research
[22:09:23] <galambo_> feep, yes the argument is basically 15% annual returns
[22:09:25] <Gurkenglas> feep, having an extra 10^-10 of the world's money might well give you the means to change probability of foom by 10^-10
[22:09:39] <feep> Gurkenglas: money is continuous, but means are discrete
[22:09:39] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: so, you know I said I'd link a friend of mine that method? He replied with https://ton.twitter.com/i/ton/data/dm/1418239658081677326/1418239649806360579/zHr_pRIO.jpg:small
[22:09:46] <feep> I mean, I guess you could give it to miri lol
[22:09:53] <linear> galambo_: Similar to what you mentioned, if you're particularly extremely-worried about potential downside, you could start with a fund e.g. SPY, and if things get very bad (let's say you are down 25% in some time period) you could leverage up to 2X, and if they get *really* bad (let's say -50% SPY), you could leverage up to 3X. This of course has its own unique risk/reward profiles, but it's something 
[22:09:53] <linear> I've often liked given some constraints and goals
[22:09:57] <feep> anyway gonna go to bed
[22:10:23] <galambo_> linear, isnt that the opposite of what I should do?
[22:10:37] <galambo_> if the market goes down maybe I should stop leveraging because its too volatile
[22:10:44] <galambo_> especially with etfs that readjust daily
[22:10:47] <catern> galambo_: I don't think you understand the reasoning behind "stop thinking" yet, so maybe a little bit of thinking is okay
[22:10:52] <gwern> mst: broken link?
[22:11:14] <galambo_> catern, is it because I am the worst enemy of myself?
[22:11:17] <mst> shit, twitter for once managed to enforce link safety, sec
[22:11:18] <catern> galambo_: no
[22:11:28] <galambo_> and if I get too invested I might make rash decisions?
[22:11:30] <linear> galambo_: depending on how you model the risks, I am one that thinks it's more likely things will 'go on as normal' sooner or later, so I'd rather 'buy the dip' more aggressively the worst the dip is, so to speak, as much as that isn't how I'd want to phrase it. It's more so if you're particularly worried about e.g. investing in a 2x or 3x and then finding yourself down 50%++ too soon
[22:11:33] <catern> galambo_: also no
[22:12:02] <catern> galambo_: you have to use the outside view. you look at the world and it seems to you that this area you're interested in, that you know a lot about - hey, it's a big growth area, you think it will do really well!

[22:12:14] <mst> gwern: ^^
[22:12:24] <catern> galambo_: but there are people with the same view for every part of the economy
[22:12:31] <gwern> ~tcl empowers users~
[22:12:37] <feep> the orthodox reason to not think is, if you think you will make trades, and you actually know nothing, so the trades will drain your money with fees
[22:12:41] <gwern> with reliable, time-tested designs
[22:12:44] <galambo_> linear, also how do you buy the dip if you already put all your allocation into the leveraged account?
[22:12:45] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[22:12:56] <catern> galambo_: most of them do not get that big growth that they think they will get
[22:12:56] <galambo_> catern, I think AGI is a special case
[22:13:06] <linear> galambo_: in this scenario I meant you go 100% SPY, then to 'buy the dip' with no money you sell SPY and buy 100% SPY 2X, or some similar allocation
[22:13:11] <galambo_> also I think metaculus is reasonably calibrated
[22:13:11] <catern> galambo_: why? the other yous also think they're a special case
[22:13:24] <catern> they have their own good reasons for why they're right
[22:13:34] <catern> those reasons make sense internally
[22:13:41] <galambo_> and this argument has been mentioned before by multiple people in lw. (I know I am appealing to authority but Im just saying it is not outlandish)
[22:13:45] <feep> ~epistemical learned helplessness~
[22:13:47] <Gurkenglas> feep, being deliberately responsible for an increase in the probability of AGI going well while aware of the post-foom acausal trade situation sure seems to place one in a better bargaining position then
[22:13:52] <catern> but from the outside... if you heard about someone who had a great idea to make a lot of money...
[22:13:54] <catern> you should be skeptical
[22:13:55] <gwern> feep: is feepbot properly queuing? I'm not seeing the PM acks like before
[22:14:08] <feep> gwern: it's sitting at 7
[22:14:22] <Gurkenglas> so it sounds like one might be able to trade funds before foom for votes/portions of the cosmos after foom

[22:15:33] <catern> galambo_: how do you know you're not in a cult and what you're saying isn't just complete nonsense? how many people have gotten rich so far off of, specifically, advice from LW and Metaculus?
[22:15:39] <galambo_> I mean I have already utilised this information by investing in the S&P 500 instead of a global tracker. the S&P 500 is biased toward tech companies
[22:15:51] <galambo_> catern, I have
[22:15:54] <gwern> catern: quite a few people, although that's primarily from DL and crypto!
[22:15:55] <feep> gwern: can confirm they got queued

[22:16:34] <gwern> feep: hm. maybe irssi ignoring MSGS doesn't work like I thought it did
[22:16:36] <catern> gwern: right! they've gotten rich from random shared culture that intersects with crypto
[22:16:50] <catern> gwern: (DL though? who's gotten rich from that?)
[22:16:59] <gwern> catern: DM founders, most obviously
[22:17:09] <gwern> catern: this includes LW investors like jaan
[22:17:10] <galambo_> catern, of course I could have been lucky

[22:18:30] <feep> ~
[22:19:38] <galambo_> Im just trying to reconcile all this conflicting evidence and advice
[22:20:53] <galambo_> linear, yes I was thinking like you said actually. basically my initial plan while reading the book was 100% 2x leveraged S&P 500
[22:21:08] <galambo_> s&p 500 is 27% tech
[22:21:52] <linear> I do agree that with high-paying jobs and someone who is young, they should be more aggressive at least, that sounds pretty okay to me 
[22:22:08] <linear> I suppose the important factor is that you don't 'mess up', e.g. get emotional during a downturn and sell, or constantly change your mind, etc
[22:22:17] <Gurkenglas> is there any fund that tries to convert prediction market info into stock market profit, so that we can invest in it without reading the prediction markets?
[22:22:20] <catern> it's not super conflicted - you either accept the outside view perspective that your stock picks are not going to be good, or you feel strongly enough about your inside view that you want to actually go with your stock picks. or, more probably, you interpolate between them with 75% VTSAX and 25% stock-picks
[22:23:15] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[22:23:27] <galambo_> catern, I dont want to do stock picks. that sounds like an inefficient use of my time. what I would potentially do is put my money into an ETF thats focused on AI or robotics or tech
[22:23:28] *** Joins: GvP (~GvP@ip70-162-85-176.ph.ph.cox.net)
[22:23:35] <gwern> Gurkenglas: I would not be surprised if private hedge funds scrape predictit, metaculus, and other PMs and use them as a signal. but the connection between PMs and immediate financial market outcomes is tenuous (and the CFTC and SEC very much insist you keep it that way)
[22:24:33] <catern> galambo_: "stock picks" was intended to include anything like that
[22:24:42] <Gurkenglas> you mean, CFTC and SEC would be unhappy if PMs started to talk explicitly about stock prices?
[22:25:27] <gwern> or indexes, or commodity futures, or... you may remember intrade getting into trouble
[22:25:30] <Gurkenglas> what happens when crypto PMs do this?
[22:25:41] <gwern> they are already so bathed in sin it makes no difference
[22:25:52] <galambo_> also heres another crazy thing. I watched this youtube video. this guy said he made a new altcoin. so I paid a small amount on the coin and bought at $1 per share. and then like a couple of weeks later the coin was worth $200 and I was like wtf: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSEMJDwvXk

[22:26:14] <galambo_> the coin has now dropped to $70. I should have sold then. but like what is going on with crypto
[22:26:18] <gwern> galambo_: so you participated in the pump and dump

[22:27:01] <galambo_> I want to abuse it
[22:27:04] <galambo_> thats free money
[22:27:12] <gwern> by being a bit faster and more plugged into the scam than the other fish

[22:28:24] <mst> galambo_: it's a gamble, and whoever gets out last loses
[22:29:22] <galambo_> but like Im not a gambling person. I just bought it because the youtuber was saying it was backed by USDC so it couldnt drop below $1. and I bought it for $1
[22:29:46] <catern> galambo_: oh, I get it now, you want to use the knowledge you have to get money - yes, of course - here's a secret, this is a good technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceijkZQI1HM

[22:31:36] <galambo_> like I made more money after watching a youtube video than I do working an entire year
[22:31:50] <galambo_> this is so stupid
[22:31:56] <Ralith> hey #lw help me commit securities fraud
[22:31:59] <gwern> ('being backed by usdc' is a lie)
[22:32:11] <Ralith> a youtuber told me to
[22:32:37] <gwern> it's a shitcoin so you should sell out before it collapses. dollar-cost averaging only makes sense if it has positive EV and you want to trade away from EV for variance reduction
[22:32:49] <galambo_> catern, well you see I am getting lots of signals that I live in a matrix and I keep breaking its code
[22:32:57] <catern> that's called schizophrenia
[22:32:58] <galambo_> and I will get overconfident
[22:33:03] <galambo_> and do something stupid
[22:33:07] <gwern> you're rich enough you don't need to pay for risk-aversion or variance reduction, and it's a shitcoin so its EV is negative
[22:33:07] <galambo_> and waste all my money
[22:33:22] <galambo_> gwern, what is EV sorry?
[22:33:28] <catern> something stupid like buy shitcoins?
[22:34:03] <two2thehead> galambo_, I presume the usual suggestion of 'cocaine and hookers' has been made?
[22:34:49] <galambo_> catern, yes but my stupid action worked. also I made a similarly large amount of money from a small 'investment' in dogecoin in early-mid 2020
[22:36:22] <catern> okay well anyway my advice on how to make money is to work a high-paying job in tech or finance
[22:36:23] <galambo_> anyways what investment strategy do you guys have?
[22:37:06] <galambo_> catern, this ship has sailed

[22:39:01] <galambo_> like he would buy many of them
[22:39:22] <galambo_> people thought they had say one in 10000 chance of making it
[22:39:37] <galambo_> but the probability was like 1 in 5000 or 1 in 1000 or something like that
[22:39:45] <galambo_> so most of the stocks he bought failed but he still made money

[22:50:22] <dbohdan> gwern: Sell?  Never.  Open source?  Maybe.
[22:51:22] <linear> (also nice to note they can be overvalued, but also be even more overvalued much later on)

[22:54:36] <galambo_> I feel ARK is one of the actively managed funds that are in tune with the 
[22:54:39] <galambo_> lets say
[22:54:44] <galambo_> lw interests
[22:56:12] <kuudes> index funds 99% and 1% to your opinion
[22:56:41] <galambo_> kuudes, yes I am now 100% s&p 500 mainly because I am very confused
[22:59:03] <kuudes> "<feep> but yes, the reflective advice I'd give is stop thinking & vanguard" <- seems sane
[22:59:16] <nshepperd> the market is designed to make you confused so that checks out
[22:59:16] <linear> whatever choice you do end up making, there's zero chance it will be the best possible choice, and zero chance it will be the worst possible choice, so it does seem like maybe you are overthinking at that point
[22:59:17] <kuudes> that sounds a good position to be galambo_
[22:59:37] <linear> (and I do kind of hate that that is true. I'd prefer it if the world didn't work that way, but I'm unsure what that'd look like)
[22:59:43] <kuudes> better than "I am confused and own this complicated set of derivatives which currently is net negative and I am over my ears in debt"
[23:00:24] <kuudes> oh yeah, actionable advice!
[23:00:30] <galambo_> kuudes, but worse than I read on metaculus in 2021 that tech stocks will soar and now I am in 2031 and I am like why didnt I invest more in tech stocks?
[23:00:36] <kuudes> learn how you can get your piece of the free money that ecb is pouring out
[23:00:52] <galambo_> but fine
[23:00:56] <kuudes> they seem to start offering loans for -0.75% interest while taking in deposits for -0.5% interest
[23:01:00] <Ralith> idk, with a start like "youtube told me to do securities fraud" I think approaching the worst possible choice is in reach
[23:01:15] <kuudes> so if one takes 10000 loan from ecb and deposits it to ecb, one nets 25 per year
[23:01:17] <galambo_> the best thing about s&p 500 is that I will not have to worry about it. just let it do its thing.
[23:01:26] <linear> there will also always be a *lot* of easy paths that make you regret things, because some other random fund/stock will always have randomly 10X'd out of nowhere
[23:01:35] <linear> a lot of it is really about emotional management 
[23:01:59] <kuudes> btw have you played with metaculus or predictionbook.com galambo_?
[23:02:51] <galambo_> kuudes, no I will tell you what I do. I am subscribed to metaculus rss feed. I read the items on the rss feed 1 week late. I guess in my mind what the prediction is and compare it to what the consensus is
[23:03:07] <galambo_> 1 week is enough time for the metaculus community to reach a consensus
[23:03:27] <galambo_> I am too lazy to actually participate

[23:05:31] <RiversHaveWings> you should sell it immediately lol
[23:05:54] <dbohdan> galambo_: What did you expect?  I predicted 5% before opening the page.
[23:06:21] <galambo_> dbohdan, thats a ridiculously high probability. I thought cryonics was a shot at the moon
[23:06:43] <galambo_> I know we managed to revive mouse kidneys
[23:06:48] <galambo_> but still
[23:08:12] <galambo_> also I want to have an identity. getting a diversified index fund is so lame and beta. I want to be macho.
[23:08:38] <galambo_> I invest in paperclip companies
[23:08:41] <galambo_> why?
[23:09:00] <galambo_> because I am a paperclip maximiser. thats what I am
[23:09:01] <nshepperd> if you want to do better than index funds, you need a competitive advantage. that approximately means, for some X, knowing way more about X than the fuckers at goldman. and other potential traders in X

[23:12:10] <Robomot> We need a standard set of community advice for how to financially prepare for AGI - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (Earlier today I was reading this post about the rationalist community's limited success betting on bitcoin and thinking about how the singularity is going to be the ultimate test of the rationalist community's ability to translate their unusual perspectives into wealth and influence. …)
[23:12:15] <dbohdan> galambo_: If superhuman AGI arrives before 2050 and doesn't kill us all, then cryonics will be radically more likely to work (both the preservation and the revival part -- the patient only need to be frozen for a year to count as success).  I give AGI before 2050 over 5%.
[23:12:21] <galambo_> nshepperd, look for the heading 'Is there really an opportunity here? Why would we expect to beat the market in this situation?'
[23:13:12] <galambo_> dbohdan, true. see AGI will fix everything

[23:13:36] <dbohdan> nshepperd: Yes
[23:14:01] <galambo_> dbohdan, yes
[23:14:26] <nshepperd> my expectation is that after AGI money will be irrelevant one way or another
[23:18:30] <kuudes> "<galambo_> also I want to have an identity. getting a diversified index fund is so lame and beta. I want to be macho." <- this is the costliest identity
[23:18:48] <galambo_> OK my plan is probably to continue vanilla S&P 500 until the PE ratios drop and the market is more sane. then I can consider leveraging at that point. s&p 500 is not a bad choice. low fees, has some bias toward tech but still very diversified. so best of all worlds. when/if the PE ratios drop either because of a crash or increased earnings I can maybe consider leveraging
[23:20:11] <galambo_> I would probably leverage s&p 500 rather than buy a tech ETF. simply because diversification is a free lunch. and leveraged s&p 500 is already 54% exposed to tech
[23:20:55] <galambo_> (this is not financial advice. as you have noticed, I am still very confused and not sure what to do)
[23:24:57] <galambo_> if its too good to be true it probably is
[23:25:43] <galambo_> also I dont intend to exceed 2x leveraging at any point. I dont have the appetite for going beyond that
[23:28:42] <linear> sounds reasonable but do have a mental plan prepared for if the decrease in PE either doesn't happen, or happens year(s) from now at much higher prices
[23:31:33] <galambo_> Im still exposed to the market
[23:32:22] <linear> yeah, just nice to try to forecast your emotions to make sure it'd go well. If, 5 years from now, it is "I made 100%, but if I was in the 2x I would have made ~200% plus", is that 1) acceptable because you had much lowe risk, and 2) won't cause you to change your mind later and fomo into 2x
