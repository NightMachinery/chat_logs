[01:10:37] <toretto> hey, i'm new to javascript. i've a log dump, which is JSON format that contains few numeric data. what javascript library did you guys recommend for processing that log and outputting a pretty format on the web through graphs and such?
[01:12:47] <gehn> a single library to do all that? I'm not sure if such a thing exists, but if it does you can probably find it on either github or npmjs.com through their search features
[01:13:11] <gehn> with that said, there are a few more fully featured tools (wouldn't call them libraries) that might work for you such as Grafana

[01:14:57] <theskillwithin> this is unrelated, but I like this browser extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa
[01:15:09] <gehn> if you just want charting and graphing libraries there are several to choose from including D3.js, DC.js, flotr, highcharts, etc
[01:15:43] <gehn> you would of course then need to actually, you know, write some of your own JS to get your data to draw using (one or more of) those charting libs
[01:16:11] <toretto> yeah, mostly the raw logs are processed using a Perl script and it outputs a JSON file which I can feed into javascript for outputting nice graphs on the web.
[01:16:55] <toretto> so, the job of the JS would only take that output JSON and graph it onto a web page
[01:17:14] <theskillwithin> D3 is really powerful, you can do pretty much anything in D3.  but its prob not the easiest to learn
[01:17:35] <gehn> I generally don't recommend D3, personally, but it's very popular
[01:17:47] <gehn> if you were going to try to using D3, I'd say at least try using DC instead first
[01:18:25] <toretto> i'd like to go for the easy one, since the job that javascript does is pretty stright forward.
[01:18:29] <gehn> toretto, so probably just start with one of the libs I mentioned, or better google for "js charting library", I'm sure you'll get ample results
[01:18:37] <gehn> easy is all relative
[01:18:44] <gehn> if you're new to JS, none if this is likely to be easy
[01:18:59] <gehn> but that also then depends on your background
[01:19:25] <gehn> were you a C++ programmer for 20 years already? if so this will probably be easier than if today is like your first day programming
[01:19:37] <toretto> I'm a C programmer, yes.
[01:19:43] <gehn> for how long?
[01:19:59] <gehn> years isn't really a good estimate for that either, hours is better
[01:20:15] <toretto> uhmmm...3 years. i'm pretty young.
[01:20:20] <toretto> 3-4
[01:20:24] <gehn> 3 years for how many hours per day?
[01:20:36] <ljharb> that seem short enough that you can still forget it and learn JS :-)
[01:20:41] <theskillwithin> gehn well he'd make you a graph to show you, but well...
[01:20:46] <toretto> oh, i do 10+ hours a day atleast.
[01:21:02] <gehn> 10+ hours per day of C programming? every day of the week? every day of the year?
[01:21:07] <toretto> yes
[01:21:11] <gehn> ok
[01:21:19] <gehn> also that was three questions, yes to all three?
[01:21:47] <toretto> yes to all of them. i do C or related to C and C++ or Perl. but mostly C and related.
[01:21:52] <gehn> ok
[01:22:02] <theskillwithin> how many unnecessary questions do you need to ask!
[01:22:07] <toretto> lol
[01:22:10] <theskillwithin> ‚ù§Ô∏è
[01:22:25] <farn> but what do you do the other 14 hours of the day?
[01:22:30] <gehn> well, easy is still relative here, but you'll have an easier time than someone who has never programmed at least I'm sure
[01:22:31] <farn> we need to get to the bottom of this
[01:22:42] <gehn> farn, if it's not programming, it doesn't matter

[01:23:02] <toretto> farn: i do math, sys admin, play piano and sleep.
[01:23:58] <gehn> there's usually going to be a balance between level of effort you put in and how good the final product looks
[01:24:18] <gehn> if you don't mind if it looks like an engineer made it (read: looks like shit) then level of effort is low

[01:26:02] <gehn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat
[01:26:47] <gehn> the analogy here is "look good" not necessarily look specifically like his art
[01:26:52] <toretto> interesting, but i don't deal with UI
[01:27:02] <theskillwithin> probably the worst analogy iv ever heard
[01:27:06] <toretto> my clients are engineers themselves.
[01:27:08] <gehn> thanks
[01:27:33] <sheetjs> toretto: separation of concerns demands there be multiple libraries
[01:27:48] <gehn> the other analogy is "looks good enough someone would pay millions for it"
[01:27:49] <sheetjs> one to process the data, and one to display it

[02:04:57] <theskillwithin> z1haze need more details
[02:05:03] <gehn> z1haze, filter and then sort would be at least one option
[02:05:18] <gehn> another would be a custom comparator that always returns -1 for null
[02:05:26] <z1haze> just a collection of objects with an optional date field i want to sort by.
[02:05:39] <z1haze> i actually tried this, but no dice
[02:05:46] <z1haze> -1 is still greater than the differnce between 2 dates
[02:05:46] <theskillwithin> technically if your just sorting, there all there anyways
[02:05:54] <gehn> though actually I'm not sure, that comparator could end up causing the equivalent of an infinite loop?
[02:05:59] <theskillwithin> you mean filtering
[02:06:03] <sheetjs> z1haze: how do you compare two unspecified dates?
[02:06:17] <z1haze> well in javascript date objects are comparable
[02:06:25] <z1haze> so im just doing that
[02:06:27] <gehn> I guess it returns 0 for two nulls, otherwise null always sorts less than its comparee
[02:07:18] <theskillwithin> how about you just don't filter if there isn't 2 dates set in the first place?
[02:07:30] <theskillwithin> assuming you are writing the code
[02:07:46] <sheetjs> n> [{x:1,d:new Date()}, {x:2, d:new Date(2077,1,1)}, {x:3}, {x:4}].sort((x,y) => (x.d ? x.d.valueOf() : -1) - (y.d ? y.d.valueOf() : -1));
[02:07:47] <jellobot> (okay) [ { x: 3 }, { x: 4 }, { x: 1, d: 2021-08-07T21:37:47.154Z }, { x: 2, d: 2077-02-01T00:00:00.000Z } ]
[02:07:52] <sheetjs> like that?
[02:08:15] <z1haze> huh? large array of objects. some have dates, some don't. want to keep all results, filtering is not what i want. i want to sort by the date field within these objects, any objects with date of null should be pushed to the bottom

[02:08:58] <gehn> at least, in terms of what you do with a filter
[02:09:00] <z1haze> that's literally what it means, lol

[02:10:06] <gehn> it can also be used thusly to split a list into separate types of things
[02:10:07] <theskillwithin> z1haze you meant the date is optional in the data, not the sorting.  lol sorry i mixed that up
[02:10:10] <z1haze> i think i got er done
[02:10:21] <z1haze> yeah man, the date is just an optional field
[02:10:30] <z1haze> but that's all i have to sort by. it sucks but gotta deal with it
[02:10:49] <gde35> make dates into unix time stamps then sort a<b
[02:11:11] <gehn> var a = list.filter(hasDate); var b = list.filter(noDate); var output = a.concat(b);
[02:11:18] <z1haze> that works, just have to deal with the nulls. also you dont need to make them timestamps. dates in ajvascript are comparable as dates
[02:11:21] <gehn> now you have a list with all the dates at one end and all the non dates at the other end
[02:11:35] <gde35> nah if it doesn't have a date it should just use 0
[02:11:38] <gehn> and you can optionally filter the list that does have dates before doing the concat

[06:35:05] <z1haze> from my understanding its possible to do this without the plugin by using the utc offsets

[06:37:12] <ljharb> right but you can't do it without replicating all the logic in moment-timezone for the specific timezone in question
[06:37:28] <ljharb> z1haze: "i want to do <exactly what the plugin does> without the plugin" is a pretty nonsense want
[06:37:33] <GreenJello> the alternative is to use the Intl APIs

[06:38:38] <z1haze> anyway, thanks ill figure it out.
[06:38:45] <ljharb> z1haze: so a) they're wrong, and b) if you listen to that you can't use moment at all

[06:40:06] <ljharb> z1haze: but, again, if you want to listen to that, you can't use moment *at all* - moment-timezone is precisely as legacy as moment is

[07:34:37] <Fiji> hi, i am trying to access the `innerHTML` of an iFrame of a local file. no matter what i do, firefox is telling me that i'm not able to access the property "document" on a cross-origin object. as far as i can tell, i've configured CORS properly on my server, but i'm not sure what could be the reason... i mean, the iframe is definitely from the same origin! (i am trying to access it from a javascript file that is a sibling to the file that is in the iframe)
[07:34:39] <Byteflux> a few countries have stricter rules, they just often don't get enforced or are bypassed. very similar story in japan and south korea

[22:30:04] <gde35> did CORS kill requesting xml on the local file system or was that always disabled?
[22:30:48] <gde35> its odd that everything just works running html from a folder except xhr
[22:31:30] <gde35> there must have been a time when everything worked
[22:31:48] <GreenJello> gde35, IIRC always disabled in browsers other than FF, and FF disabled it several years ago
[22:32:02] <gde35> ic
[22:32:09] <gde35> you know why?
[22:32:42] <gde35> it kinda makes me giggle that one has to run a webserver for security purposes
[22:33:03] <GreenJello> security; it allowed reading arbitrary files off the user's file system by getting them to open a .html file
[22:33:18] <GreenJello> which you could upload to your server automatically
[22:33:41] <gde35> ah so it allowed reading everything originally
[22:33:48] <GreenJello> yeah
[22:33:49] <gde35> it still does that with images?
[22:34:02] <gde35> one can ../../..//img.jpg ?
[22:34:17] <GreenJello> I think you can get the image dimensions, and if it exists, but otherwise nothing else is leaked
[22:34:35] <gde35> I think you can still put js in the folder
[22:34:44] <GreenJello> you can't XHR for the image
[22:34:55] <gde35> no but you can use it on the page I mean
[22:35:12] <GreenJello> sure, but that doesn't really leak anything
[22:35:17] <gde35> it seems to me ideally that everything should just work and the folder should be the origin?
[22:35:44] <GreenJello> I think it should be more locked down than it is currently
[22:35:50] <gde35> reading everything on the file system is obviously not a cool idea
[22:35:52] <ljharb> nothing should use `file://` at all
[22:36:06] <gde35> html as a document format is just fine?
[22:36:07] <ljharb> many web features don't even work properly on file:// anymore, and that's only getting worse
[22:36:08] <GreenJello> loading arbitrary JS files is a security risk
[22:36:14] <ljharb> gde35: only when served from a webserver.
[22:36:26] <ljharb> gde35: as a local document format it is not just fine
[22:36:55] <gde35> ljharb: not at all, opening up the box to the internet is not a fantastic security solution
[22:37:16] <ljharb> gde35: nobody said that
[22:37:24] <ljharb> gde35: you can, and should, run a local webserver
[22:37:43] <ljharb> gde35: browsers themselves are simply not implementing new web features on file:// - the protocol has been dying a long time.
[22:37:45] <gde35> Originally I would just make the website on the computer then upload it when done
[22:37:50] <ljharb> right but that was 20 years ago
[22:37:54] <ljharb> that's not viable anymore
[22:38:00] <gde35> haha what changed?
[22:38:06] <ljharb> (whether it *should* be is irrelevant)
[22:38:12] <ljharb> security issues changed
[22:38:35] <ljharb> it's much easier to get someone to open a malicious html file locally than to actually install malicious software
[22:38:52] <gde35> I think getting rid of as many protocols as possible is not much fun but I could see it as someones opinion
[22:39:11] <gde35> maybe if the outgrowth of other cruft was not as bad as it is I would agree
[22:40:01] <gde35> ljharb: wouldn't limiting xhr to the folder it self and to .xml and .json be sufficient?
[22:42:12] <gde35> if it is not a viable way of making websites anymore it means one cant do web development out of the box on say windos
[22:42:36] <ljharb> no, xhr doesn't work on file
[22:42:55] <gde35> I know, I just wonder if it shouldn't
[22:42:58] <ljharb> so yes, you can't do web dev anymore out of the box unless you have a webserver somewhere
[22:43:16] <ljharb> note that modern web dev also requires using modules and a bundler and probably a transpiler
[22:43:23] <gde35> which philosophically moves us to a master slave situation
[22:43:24] <ljharb> the days of making local websites and just FTPing them up are long gone
[22:43:34] <ljharb> i'm not sure what you mean but i'm QUITE sure that is not the analogy you want to be using
[22:43:40] <gde35> requires? haha, I don't even know how to use any of those.
[22:43:41] <ljharb> please rephrase?
[22:43:52] <ljharb> gde35: then it's half a decade past time to learn
[22:44:02] <gde35> what am I missing out on?
[22:44:09] <ljharb> node for modules
[22:44:14] <onosendi> ljharb: your view on typescript, is there an article somewhere that highlights your arguments?
[22:44:14] <ljharb> a bundler (browserify or webpack)
[22:44:17] <ljharb> a transpiler (babel)
[22:44:17] <gde35> I use php
[22:44:19] <ljharb> onosendi: no idea
[22:44:27] <ljharb> gde35: you still need node for the build process
[22:44:33] <ljharb> gde35: what you use to serve the files doesn't matter
[22:44:44] <gde35> I dont use modules
[22:45:44] <gde35> why would I need modules to make a website?
[22:45:55] <gde35> I get that they have a place if compexity is sufficient
[22:46:07] <ljharb> they always are needed
[22:46:13] <ljharb> if you have any JS at all, at least.
[22:46:14] <gde35> lol
[22:46:22] <ljharb> there is no website so simple that modules aren't a good choice for it.
[22:46:28] <ljharb> (that has JS at all, ofc)
[22:46:37] <gde35> name a module and ill go look at it
[22:46:46] <gde35> the most basic thing
[22:47:21] <gde35> I really cant imagine
[22:47:43] <ljharb> i'm not sure what you're looking for, there's more JS modules on npm than in any module repository on the planet
[22:47:52] <ljharb> pick a thing, there's one or more modules for it
[22:48:28] <gde35> I feel it overcomplicates things
