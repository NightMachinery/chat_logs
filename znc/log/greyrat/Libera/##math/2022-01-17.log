[02:05:07] <PlanckWalk> OpenGL isn't the only possible way to do rendering.
[02:06:00] <PlanckWalk> Yuo can transform to (x', y', z') where (x',y') maps directly to screen coordinates.

[07:12:46] <XCode> Decker: yes. Let us say we have a projective surface S that embedds into P^4.
[07:13:34] <XCode> Decker: Consider the map S --> P^4 --> P^2. The first map is i and second map is Pr_{3,4,5}.
[07:15:22] <XCode> let us say that s <--> (s_0,s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4,s_5). Denote the map above by f, consider the map f^{-1}(f(s)) = C x {(s_2,s_3,s_4)}

[07:17:52] <XCode> Decker: yes I consider a line as well.
[07:17:53] <Decker> isn't it more like a plane that might contain a curve?
[07:18:55] <Decker> XCode can you go over this P and S notation?  It seems to be different... https://www.jstor.org/stable/24493492 ? sort of p4 ?
[07:19:11] <XCode> Decker: but there is something I don't understand. So X is a surface. How can we have another plane though.
[07:20:08] <Decker> XCode so that 'x' isn't a 'crossproduct' it's a x representing the surface?  Sure I could see C would be a curve
[07:20:20] <Decker> could be a plane-filling curve :) but a cure

[08:49:34] <Decker> guess that wouldn't help :/
[08:50:45] <DaPinkOne> the cursory google search yields n^n = exp(c) and something about lambert W functions, but I'm just a wee undergrad, never heard of this
[08:51:02] <frelleck> you can express it in terms of the Lambert function yes
[08:51:20] <frelleck> if you write m = log n then it's c = m e^m
[08:51:33] <frelleck> so this is the definition of saying m = W(c)
[08:51:36] <frelleck> not much more you can do
[08:53:37] <DaPinkOne> c is a known quantity, so I guess i'm coming up with some approximation then. thanks for the help :)

[11:18:52] <PlanckWalk> In general rotation of an ellipsoid has three parameters, not two
[11:18:58] <Guest11> but offseting it, seems to alter a and b, for no obvious reason
[11:19:14] <Guest11> yes, i am simplifying it to an ellipse

[11:20:28] <PlanckWalk> Well okay, we can simplify to an ellipse

[11:21:29] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't
[11:21:51] <Guest11> ok, let me try this differently
[11:22:16] <Guest11> I have a matlab routine I got from matlab that generates data points on the surface of an ellipsoid
[11:22:25] <PlanckWalk> a (x-h)^2 + b (y-k)^2 + c (x-h)(y-k) + d (x-h) + e (y-k) = 1  doesn't affect the coefficients on x^2, y^2, or xy
[11:22:38] <Guest11> for which I define the center point, the radii, and theta and phi
[11:23:07] <Guest11> it then fits this data to get ax^2 + by^2 +cz^2 + dxy + exz + fyz + gx + hy + iz = 1

[11:23:52] <PlanckWalk> Fits, as in some statistical approximation?
[11:24:18] <Guest11> yes, it chooses (a..i) values to best fit the ellipsoid
[11:24:27] <PlanckWalk> In general there are multiple exact solutions, even
[11:25:16] <PlanckWalk> E.g. if you rotate an ellipse through pi/2, you get the same formula as an unrotated ellipse swapping x and y coefficients

[11:30:18] <PlanckWalk> So maybe let's talk about the simpler case of an ellipse.  Does the same problem happen for you there?
[11:30:37] <PlanckWalk> At least with an ellipse there's really only two sign conventions and no choice of axis.
[11:30:39] <Guest11> xt= x*cos(ang1)*cos(ang2) - y*sin(ang1) + z*cos(ang1)*sin(ang2);

[11:30:40] <Guest11>  zt= x*(-sin(ang2))                      + z*cos(ang2);
[11:30:55] <Guest11> i am calling ang1 phi and ang2 theta
[11:30:59] <Guest11> but like I said, I don't really care
[11:31:04] <Guest11> either is fine
[11:31:08] <Guest11> it's kind of arbitrary
[11:31:14] <Guest11> just like the sign is arbitrary
[11:31:14] <PlanckWalk> Instead of about a dozen choices of axes and 4 conventions.
[11:31:33] <Guest11> i don't have anything setup to work with ellipses
[11:31:52] <PlanckWalk> Ah.
[11:32:08] <Guest11> i just got that tranform from rotational matrix in wikipedia
[11:32:14] <Guest11> as far as I know, it's correct
[11:32:25] <PlanckWalk> It's correct for one particular convention, yes.
[11:32:36] <Guest11> sure
[11:33:00] <Guest11> i'm then using the formula I provided before
[11:33:09] <Guest11> I get that cos^2 theta = (c -1/rx^2) / (1/rz^2 - 1/rx^2)
[11:33:11] <PlanckWalk> Anyway, at this stage you have a cloud of data points?
[11:33:27] <PlanckWalk> Distributed over the surface of a rotated ellipsoid?
[11:33:30] <Guest11> or rather cos^2 ang2 = (c-1/rx^2)/(1/rz^2-1/rx^2)
[11:33:39] <Guest11> yes, with noise in the data
[11:33:44] <PlanckWalk> Even more fun
[11:33:58] <PlanckWalk> How do you get rx,ry,rz from those points?
[11:34:04] <Guest11> https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24693-ellipsoid-fit

[11:34:50] <Guest11> but ang1 and ang2 aren't (note that I added ang2 to their code, they only have ang in there)
[11:36:59] <Guest11> the code appears to work, when I put in an arbitrary offset, radii, and ang1/ang2 i get back what appears to be approximately correct for offset, and radii

[12:12:27] <Guest11> PlanckWalk I agree, however, I did find an interesting comment:
[12:12:51] <Guest11> Lots of questions below about how to use the output to correctly map points onto a unit sphere. Here's the answer:
[12:12:51] <Guest11> corrected_point = C * (raw_point - center)
[12:12:52] <Guest11> where corrected_point, raw_point, center are 3x1 vectors (x,y,z) and C = evecs*diag(1./radii)*evecs' is a symmetric 3x3 matrix.
[12:13:16] <Guest11> I am in fact trying to map it to a 0-offset unit spehere
[12:13:20] <Guest11> and this appears to work perfectly
[12:14:08] <Guest11> albeit I have no idea if rotation will be needed (it probably will be)
[12:14:20] <greenbagels> Smilex: should that say dim(U+W)?
[12:15:30] <Guest11> basically, i am trying to take magnetometer data and map it to a direction (in both pitch and yaw)
[12:15:37] <greenbagels> or is the W part only relevant for other questions
[12:17:05] <Guest11> but it occurs to me, that there may be an offset of both pitch and yaw which is unavoidable and cannot be automatically calibrated out... it'd have to be calibrated out by putting it in a known orientation and then telling what orientation that is
[12:17:10] <tusko> suppose we have z = r*e^i\theta and we want to compute z^2. That is (r*e^i\theta) * (r*e^i\theta) = (r*cos\theta + i r*sin\theta)^2 = r^2cos^2\theta + i*2*r^2cos\theta*sin\theta - i sin^2\theta
[12:17:16] <tusko> does that seem right?

[12:19:20] <tusko> where does 2 theta come from? sorry im mad tired
[12:20:11] <PlanckWalk> Err, (r^2, 2 theta)
[12:20:46] <PlanckWalk> (r e^(it))^2 = r^2 (e^(it))^2 = r^2 e^(2it)
[12:21:06] <PlanckWalk> = r^2 e^(i (2t))
[12:21:12] <tusko> it should you can just bring the power in like that?
[12:22:24] <PlanckWalk> It's one of the properties of exponential yes

[12:54:48] <greenbagels> not for a given example
[12:55:36] <Smilex> greenbagels: That's something that confuses me. It says, "Mark all statements that are \textbf{true} for any choice of $U, W, T$ and $S$."
[12:56:10] <greenbagels> "for any" usually means "for every"
[12:56:22] <greenbagels> for all, for any, for each; these usually mean the same thing
[12:57:34] <qbt> sek, really? This was a statement from my professors notes.... Are there any nice counterexample?
[12:57:42] <qbt> I managed to prove the converse btw :)
[12:58:31] <sek> qbt: the usual example is f:A^1\0 -> A^1, which is injective, but the induced hom of coordinate rings is k[x] -> k[x,x^{-1}]
[12:58:33] <Smilex> greenbagels: Damn. This is quite important to know :S
[12:58:41] <greenbagels> Smilex: on an actual exam, surely you will have the ability to clarify this question phrasing
[12:58:56] *** Joins: backes (~backes@85.195.206.214)
[12:59:00] <greenbagels> however, in this case, you can still do useful studying regardless of the vagueness
[12:59:45] <greenbagels> you can try to figure out when these statements are 1.) always true, 2.) sometimes true, or 3.) never true
[13:00:20] <tusko> as best I can tell, for z = x + iy, z/z* = z^2/|z|^2
[13:00:58] <qbt> sek, ah right - I did a similar thing to show that f* injective does not imply f surjective by taking X=A^1\0 and Y=A^1
[13:01:23] <sek> right, that works for both :)
[13:01:30] <qbt> cool!
[13:01:40] <qbt> confusing that the notes are wrong though!
[13:02:08] <Smilex> greenbagels: Yeah I guess that makes sense. I'd still prefer to know ahead of time though
[13:02:24] <greenbagels> Smilex: true, true
[13:02:34] <greenbagels> so in the case of this question: never true, sometimes true, or always true?
[13:02:37] <qbt> it literally states: "a nice fact is the following: f is injective iff f* is surjective" xD but I could only show the one direction
[13:02:41] <sek> in case you haven't seen at this point how A^1\0 (a distinguished open) is also an affine variety, the case of the normalisation of the cusp is also a counterexample
[13:03:00] <greenbagels> tusko: note this is equivalent to 1/z* = z/|z|^2
[13:03:24] <qbt> I have seen that! But what do you mean about the normailzation of the cusp?
[13:03:27] <Smilex> greenbagels: it's only true if both subspaces are {0}
[13:04:16] <sek> I mean the morphism A^1->V(y^2-x^3), taking t |-> (t^2,t^3)
[13:04:27] <greenbagels> Smilex: take U = {0}, W = V; does this work?

[13:04:54] <Smilex> no wait...
[13:04:57] <sek> qbt: y^2-x^3 is the cuspidal singularity, and as you'll soon cover in your course, the morphism I described "resolves the singularity at 0"

[13:06:12] <qbt> sek: I see what you mean I think, but today is actually my exam in this course sadly, so we won't get to that yet :/
[13:06:36] <qbt> thank you so much for the help, I spent way to long assuming that the "fact" was true given the notes haha
[13:06:40] <greenbagels> Smilex: what about U=W=V, where dim(V) > 0?
[13:07:53] <sek> qbt: no problem. It's a common thing to slip through in notes/exercise sheets actually
[13:07:54] <Smilex> greenbagels: Oh right. Because the intersection is equal to V, and U=W=V, so dim(U + W) = dim(V)

[21:36:42] <Z-module> Looks good. But the actual reason ker(Psi_a) is that Psi_a's codomain (K) is an integral domain.  It's not about the domain being one.
[21:37:55] <Z-module> sorry, the reason that ker(Psi_a) is prime
[21:38:23] <Z-module> meaning: a product two polys in F[x] both not in ker(Psi_a) has to also not be in ker(Psi_a)
[21:39:22] <Z-module> because if they were, say f(x), g(x) both not in that, then f(a), g(a) are both nonzero in K, thus so is f(a)g(a), thus the product poly f(x)g(x) is not in that kernel either.
[21:40:07] <Z-module> Psi_a being a ring homomorphism means that  (f(x)g(x))(a) = f(a) g(a)
[21:40:41] <cadmio> p(a)q(a) = 0 only if p(a) = 0 or q(a) = 0 and this is because both polys are in the kernel
[21:40:50] <cadmio> *this is the case
[21:41:12] <Z-module> no, it's because the product of two nonzero things in a field is nonzero
[21:41:42] <Z-module> you only need *one* of p(x), q(x) in that kernel to get p(a)q(a) = 0
[21:44:25] <Z-module> but if both are outside the kernal, then  so is p(x) q(x)
[21:44:40] <Z-module> which is the meaning of that kernel being a prime ideal
[21:45:12] <cadmio> ok so I should say "p(a)q(a) in ker implies p(a) = 0 or q(a) = 0, this means Ker is a prime ideal"
