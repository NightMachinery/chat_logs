[01:08:53] <Irvise> Hi. I just wanted to point out there is a minor typo in Emacs 27.2 and potentially newer in the "fill-column" documentation. It says "[...] It is used by filling commands, such as ‘fill-region’ and ‘fill-paragraph’, and by ‘auto-fill-mode’, which see." <- typo. Just in case someone wants to patch it. I do not have commiter rights and I am not familiar with the process.

[01:11:40] <dale> I'm having a helluva time finding "which see" in just about any reference work, except when defining the Latin abbreviation "q.v."
[01:11:53] <Irvise> dale: you can see if for yourself. C-h v fill-column.
[01:12:28] <Irvise> It just ends with nothing else. I think something got cut or someone typed more than needed.
[01:12:29] <dale> Irvise: I'm just trying (and not doing great) to say that the sentence seems grammatically correct. :)
[01:12:49] <pjb> Just go fetch methane from Jupiter!
[01:12:51] <dale> Irvise: "Which see" like this means "see the thing I just mentioned".
[01:13:43] <TitanOfOld> I'm trying to run the weblorg publish.el (https://emacs.love/weblorg/doc/index.html#publish-script) but it's just coming back with "Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, weblorg".
[01:13:58] <Irvise> Oh, I do not mean that the grammar is wrong. But if it means something, it may be better expressed. Such as "which one can refer too" or something similar. It seems that the sentence wants to say something more but just dies.

[01:15:25] <Irvise> I have personally never seen ", which see." as a construct to "should be referred to." :/
[01:15:42] <skangas> "Which see" is something I've only ever seen in Emacs, but it is perfectly valid English and correctly used here.
[01:15:49] <skangas> I'd be in favour of purging it from Emacs, FWIW.
[01:15:51] <Irvise> Ooooohhh... I get the q.v now.

[01:16:14] <dale> I use it all the time.  It's entirely possible I picked it up from Emacs, and no one else knows WTF I'm trying to say.
[01:16:23] <Irvise> I know the latin expression. Not the english translation (I am not in favour of bastardising latin).
[01:16:46] <skangas> Of course, now I'm writing docstrings that says "which see" myself, so...
[01:17:19] <Irvise> From what I have seen in the internet, it does seem to be valid English. I must apologise.
[01:18:08] <skangas> No need for apologies, I don't exactly think you are the first person to trip up on that phrase.
[01:18:17] <dale> Irvise: Hardly an offense, probably a useful observation, particularly for documentation that strives to be clear.
[01:18:20] <Irvise> I am a spanish speaker, so all the latin expressions are kept as such. I did not know that some where translated in english.
[01:18:37] <skangas> That's exactly why I'd be in favour of purging it from Emacs.

[01:20:27] <dale> Er, I assume recycle bin is still a thing.
[01:20:46] <Irvise> Should I message the ML opening a discussion about it or do I leave it to you? I think I am not really in a position to open such a discussion.
[01:21:04] <skangas> Irvise: A discussion about "which see"?
[01:21:27] <Irvise> Yes. I do not know how deep this rabbit hole goes.
[01:22:50] <dale> Irvise: If you'd like change, M-x report-emacs-bug is not a bad idea, as wasamasa suggested.  That'll help you open a bug.  I'd just point out that "which see" is not necessarily common English usage, and may be particularly confusing to non-native speakers since it does indeed looks like the sentence ended early.
[01:23:24] <skangas> I'm a non-native speaker and it confused the hell out of me too the first time I saw it.
[01:23:36] <skangas> It looks like a mistake, basically.
[01:23:54] <Irvise> I had the same experience.
[01:24:40] <Irvise> Though I must say that I love keeping historical expressions alive. So I am a bit torn. Though I would like to leave the latin expression, that is too much.
[01:25:58] <skangas> There's a place for keeping historical expressions alive; user facing documentation is not it.

[06:14:53] <xheimlich> In my little residential street (a transversal between two major arteries of the city, blocking one of them crashes the entire city traffic) there's a theater school, a ballet school for children and teens, a quirky toy store mostly with wooden wares, a dog hospital
[06:15:23] <xheimlich> porteiro is someone like the super, but not with the authority supers have in NYC at least accordidng to Seinfeld.
[06:15:39] <bpalmer> rudybot: sure, give a chihuahua a sharp scalpel. What could go wrong?
[06:15:47] <rudybot> bpalmer: beverly hills chihuahua 2!
[06:15:59] <xheimlich> but ther main duty is to stay close to the main entrance (sometimes in a cabin with CCTV etc) and buzz people in.
[06:16:00] <bremner> ah, doorman maybe? (to use the old terminology)
[06:16:21] <bremner> porte being door I guess?
[06:16:26] <edrx> yes! =)
[06:16:54] <bpalmer> not to be confused with a porter, who both opens doors and carries bags
[06:17:01] <xheimlich> now also porteiros manage online purchases people get. Mine (well, we have three or four in shifts) is very frustrated about this new role.
[06:18:12] <xheimlich> a porteiro might help someone who's old. Ours helped when we first brought the baby from the maternity and were six kinds of panicked.
[06:18:28] <edrx> xheimlich: let me guess: do you live at rua Conde de Irajá?
[06:18:48] <xheimlich> nah. I live really close to the Starbucks in question.
[06:18:54] <edrx> aaah, ok
[06:19:02] <xheimlich> between Voluntários and São Clemente.
[06:19:52] <edrx> coffee in that starbucks is very bad, but it's a good place to study.
[06:20:06] <xheimlich> it's incredible, quiet little street that might as well be in Andaraí, some slum type housing, some ultra high end buildings. Walk 3 minutes in either direction and BOOM big city.
[06:20:17] <xheimlich> Rhayader goes to town vibe.
[06:20:53] <xheimlich> what's most fascinating is that no poste ever gets demolished.
[06:21:17] <xheimlich> We have like dozeens of gas lighting fixtures still hanging around and sometimes repainted with anticorrosion stuff.
[06:21:30] <xheimlich> Also posts that used to support payphones.
[06:22:03] <xheimlich> When Darwin lived in Rio he noted how easy it was to find evidence for emerging geological theories of deep time reflected in sedimentary rock.
[06:22:32] <xheimlich> Places like Lapa are more ostensible in having old buildings, but Botafogo just piles stuff on top of stuff.
[06:22:50] <xheimlich> Old housing becomes school somehow with a Google imprint.
[06:23:49] <xheimlich> old horse estábulo (as evidenced by the wack ample doors) becomes hipster café + old clothes vending.
[06:25:34] <xheimlich> there's a tiny window where some guy makes mountain climbing rope to client specifications.

[06:28:05] <edrx> I need to repair the big camping backpack that I use and that is 20 years old.
[06:28:08] <xheimlich> gas lighting fixtures: https://www.flickr.com/photos/functorsandthecity/5301050830/
[06:28:21] <xheimlich> I don't think we had gas lighting past 1910.
[06:29:31] <edrx> most of the places that I knew in Rio that sold and repaired camping gear have closed. where is this guy that makes climbing rope? I think that I should ask him...
[06:29:58] <xheimlich> too close to where I live.
[06:30:54] <xheimlich> I don't have this view because I'm sandwiched between buildings -- I have no view at all - but this is from the top of a nearby tall building. https://www.flickr.com/photos/functorsandthecity/5236022568/
[06:31:46] <xheimlich> that's Botafogo bay -- now. When Darwin came, it was much closer. Since the 1600s and up to to the 1980s Rio kept paving over water to expand.

[21:55:23] <cgloz> perrierjouet: that's snazzy! I'm using prot's modus themes. Admittedly looks better in light... but I prefer working in dark. Doom-Modeline is so pretty, but I opted for all text based. I kinda liked mood-line for that reason
[21:56:09] <perrierjouet> why small fonts ??
[21:56:09] <fsbot> Definitely
[21:56:31] <cgloz> perrierjouet: so I use the header-line like a modeline and included global info like time and date on mini-modeline which puts a modeline of sorts in the message buffer
[21:57:16] <cgloz> header=local info, and one "mini-modeline" for time and date. I got tired of seeing that info on every single buffer
[21:57:49] * acdw tries mini-modeline again

[22:04:25] <thblt> But pushing does not involve an external editor, either.  That's a commit I think.
[22:04:39] <cgloz> perrierjouet: I'm not sure if it's the only one... what I do for modeline separator being clean is to inherit all sorts of colors in the headerline, modeline, background, etc from the number-line background. that way even if I change themes, which I have tried, I get the similar box in box with no borders on the other elements type of view
[22:04:50] <Catie> bremner: Ah, I use pinentry-tty, I'm not always in an X session

[22:05:33] <acdw> lmao
[22:05:33] <edrx> I am trying to explain a family of sequences of operations like this one - http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-saving-links-intro.html#1.3
[22:05:41] <mattf> thblt: does ERC think i have passwords stored there? how can i disabled this
[22:06:13] <Shortstop> mattf you should post your config on a pastebin and post it here for people to check out if possible
[22:06:13] <thblt> mattf: how do you identify to nickserv? Manually?
[22:06:30] <mattf> thblt: not using gpg, it is "manually" yes
[22:07:02] <cgloz> acdw: I wonder if it's possible, I had to play a LOT with the load order of mini-modeline to get it to have the right colors... so maybe it'd be possible to load a normal modelne after it? idk, it's partially why I opted for a header with modeline info instead
[22:07:05] <edrx> that are composed of many key sequences, and the final effect of these sequences of operations is always to create an elisp hyperlink to something and store that link in our notes.
[22:07:14] <perrierjouet> cgloz: what do you think of smart mode line 
[22:07:45] <acdw> cgloz yeah i'll have to mess w/ it. i don't care about colors, just want date display in echo area. and ... maybe tracking-info

[22:10:28] <tyson2> I frequenly get hangups on passphrase entry.  I blame PGP mostly for that.
[22:10:41] <bremner> you should blame GPG

[22:11:17] <thblt> mattf: (setq auth-source-debug t)
[22:11:17] <tyson2> I note that git for windows does their own pgp implementation and it's quite reliable
[22:12:01] <cgloz> johnjay: sorry missed that there. All I was saying is since I have background colors for modeline, headline, etc inherited from the number line I can drop in and replace the theme and it shouldn't for example, create a modeline with different colors from the headline. Essentially keeping the same type of look but swapping out colors, if that makes sense

[22:28:46] <johnjay> it says gpg related
[22:29:16] <bremner> yes, pinentry-foo is a program, invoked by gpg (or gpg-agent) to get passwords from the user
[22:29:18] <johnjay> yeah i read the description of pinentry-mac and i have no idea what it means
[22:29:19] <Catie> Yeah, pinentry is just the program that GPG uses to get your passphrase. So there's versions of pinentry that use various toolkits, and the graphical ones pop up a dialog box
[22:29:37] <Catie> Yeah, what bremner said
[22:29:46] <johnjay> ok. doesn't really compute so i had to ask if that's what it really does

[22:33:21] <Catie> johnjay: I've got Emacs compiled without GTK at home, and I haven't had the X11 crash bug since
[22:33:22] <bremner> it's easy to cycle through channel buffers

[22:34:34] <Shortstop> its a nightmare in that respect
[22:34:36] <rpav> yeah comparing a massively customized config to an untouched vanilla setup is probably not entirely fair ;) but to be fair, i have definitely customized erc a bit
[22:34:43] <Shortstop> I used 'exwm' up until that point when I tried ERC too so yeah

[22:34:52] <rpav> "so"
[22:34:57] <Shortstop> depends on your setup, but yeah, won't try that again, I'll just stick with Weechat for now
[22:34:58] <bremner> Shortstop: ok, fine you don't like it.
[22:35:02] <rpav> exwm seems dubious to me
[22:35:06] <tyson2> I use erc-status sidebar (now part of emacs) and am quite happy with it
[22:35:10] <ecraven> rpav: I love EXWM ;)
[22:35:16] <Shortstop> exwm is cool, but honestly, a bit overly complicated for what it can do
[22:35:16] <technomancy> haha, I'm stuck using weechat for work and it's great except to me the biggest pain is that switching channels is super tedious compared to ERC's use of emacs buffer switching
[22:35:23] <Shortstop> I stopped using exwm last week, haven't looked back
[22:35:24] <ecraven> but it all depends on how much of your day you spend inside emacs
[22:35:27] <Shortstop> I use 'eyebrowse' instead now
[22:35:42] <Catie> I didn't love exwm, but I also hadn't heard about ace windows at the time
[22:35:43] <johnjay> Catie: not sure what you mean. my emacs works fine with one x11 server but not with a second one i tried
[22:35:45] <rpav> i added picom to hlwm and now my tablet is slightly slicker than last week
[22:35:57] <wgreenhouse> Shortstop: those are orthogonal. one could use exwm and eyebrowse at the same time
[22:35:59] <rpav> also it fixed some basic usability things
[22:36:03] <Shortstop> yeah I'm headed towards more of an art direction. Having non-floating X11 windows is not that great with GIMP, etc. I know there's ways to disable it per workspace but yeah, ready to move on

[23:37:55] <Catie> Ooh, htop is my new best friend!
[23:37:58] <acdw> that's basiocally an emacs fork bomb
[23:38:07] <acdw> well,... actually this would be i guess

[23:38:30] <acdw> hahaah indeed
[23:38:34] <acdw> did it just freeze up
[23:38:36] <Catie> Anyway I'm gonna try it again but slightly different
[23:38:43] <acdw> good luck!
[23:39:01] <Catie> Yeah, it did. I have GC messages enabled like a loser, so it just flashed "Garbage collecting... Done" over and over
[23:39:22] <acdw> oh lord lol
[23:39:29] <acdw> hey at least it did /something
[23:39:30] <acdw>  
[23:39:31] <acdw> /
[23:39:40] <acdw> if you didn't have gc messages, it'd just sit there
[23:39:45] <Catie> Okay I'm working on exhausting heap memory this time. Garbage collection messages are taking longer and longer

[23:50:03] <lampilelo> but i want to solve them by hand
[23:50:30] <thblt> lampilelo: the existence of executable implementations of algorithmic solutions doesn't make that impossible :)

[23:56:04] <thblt> We could bridge Dream with picmi.  AI-generated nonograms.
[23:56:10] <lampilelo> and it wouldn't be trivial, let's say you draw a rough shape of what you want the puzzle to look like and the algorithm would take that process it and create a valid puzzle with a single solution
