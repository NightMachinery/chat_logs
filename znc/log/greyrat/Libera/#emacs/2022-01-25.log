[00:07:27] <twb> Before that, the way international politics worked was, you used gold to hire mercenaries to steal more gold

[00:31:40] <hodapp> from what I remember, systems that require something like a background pattern (e.g. rule 110), or that have harder-to-define halting conditions, are weakly universal

[01:22:37] <lispy> i can juggle for 5 seconds
[01:24:18] <lampilelo> if you throw the balls one after another really hard they may be in the air for 5 seconds, am i close to figuring out your juggling style?
[01:25:39] <thuna`> Could anyone test this with an image in a scratch buffer to see if it works for them?

[01:26:56] <Catie> Is anything supposed to happen? It evaluates to T
[01:27:32] <Catie> Ah I see, without the SLICE parameter it inserts the image just fine
[01:27:42] <thuna`> I think it is supposed to insert an image but the slice breaks it
[01:28:00] <thuna`> I don't think my slice parameters are bad either
[01:28:08] *** Joins: mon_aaraj (~MonAaraj@user/mon-aaraj/x-4416475)
[01:28:17] <Catie> It does appear to be inserting _something_ before the point, but no image is visible
[01:28:35] <thuna`> Oh... my slice parameters /were/ bad
[01:28:46] <thuna`> The second value also has to be 0.0
[01:28:54] <thuna`> Ughhh..........
[01:29:01] <Catie> Hey, it works now!
[01:29:13] <thuna`> Yeah, at least it does!
[01:29:32] <Catie> I think probably if it gets a malformed slice it shouldn't evaluate to T, you know?
[01:29:49] <thuna`> I don't think it's a malformed slice per se
[01:30:07] <thuna`> It's more of a "insert a zero height image" kind of a deal
[01:30:49] <Catie> Oh interesting! CHAR-AT-POINT returns a space, despite displaying something zero-width
[01:31:15] <thuna`> Well the character itself is space
[01:31:25] <thuna`> It's really just a propertized " "

[10:34:52] <corwin> Is it nuts for me to be thinking about buying a code-signing cert to get rid of the warnings on the windows binary releases I'm making for emacs?
[10:35:18] <corwin> s/is it nuts/how nuts is it
[10:39:53] <codingquark> I do not know why it should not be done other than (what I consider WRONG) arguments like "why pay MS?" "It's trickery to get us to obey" "Not free software!"

[10:41:19] <codingquark> If the users will feel better with signed binaries, it's okay to _have_ to pay for it I believe
[10:41:46] <bkhl> Maybe do it but put a complaint/warning about it on the splash?
[10:42:15] <codingquark> Like "I had to pay for this, please give me some money"?
[10:42:29] <bkhl> No.
[10:42:48] <bkhl> Just explaining the situation.

[10:43:19] <codingquark> Oh oh, ask people on emacs-devel to give like US$1 each
[10:43:33] <corwin> My theory is that, for some corp. users like myself, it will be easier to get a signed Emacs onto Company issued laptops
[10:43:43] <bkhl> No, just to tell people that this build required paying Microsoft and it sucks.
[10:43:46] <bkhl> Though now come to think of it is the result actually license compliant?
[10:43:51] <bkhl> Em, sry
[10:43:59] <bkhl> Anyway, what I was coming to:
[10:44:08] <corwin> Me: please use free software  Also me: *holds out hand*
[10:44:35] <bkhl> If the user can not with the source code you provide them make a new build with the same features wrt usability on their machine, are you compliant?
[10:44:52] <bkhl> For me I think the benefits outweigh the cost.
[10:45:04] <bkhl> If it makes people get into Emacs, maybe it will move them in the right direction eventually.
[10:45:05] <corwin> bkhl: afaik it shouldn't affect license compliance; that's about distributing the source code; in this case that will be handled by GNU per usual.  We're just talking about the binaries we can get from ftp.gnu.org
[10:45:15] <aidalgol> Wait, Windows warns you if you try to run unsigned binaries now?
[10:45:23] <bkhl> In this case you'd distribute your own binary distribution via MS.
[10:45:24] <codingquark> Yes, corwin even thinking about paying for the cert is amazing
[10:45:35] <bkhl> So technically you also need to provide the source for _that_.
[10:45:52] <aidalgol> bkhl: I think it's only an issue if the platform will *only* run signed executables.
[10:45:54] <bkhl> And if a usable build of that requires the certificate, then is it really compliant with the license.
[10:46:00] <corwin> if emacs were AGPL maybe, but I don't think GPL requires us to release the code used to build.
[10:46:01] <aidalgol> So, e.g., no Emacs on the iPhone.
[10:46:07] <bkhl> aidalgol, you can still run it if you accept some warning?
[10:46:17] <aidalgol> bkhl: AFAIK, yes.

[15:05:43] <dcunit3d> i have a more vanilla config on another laptop. i should be able to clone the repo there and try it with a cleaner interface. babel is pretty simple to get working out of the box. very helpful
[15:06:35] <dcunit3d> doom has some functionality that presents you with tierd sandboxes, but i use chemacs so it doesn't work without moving files around and restarting emacs.

[15:06:58] <corwin> I feel like my org setup is one of the more verbose bits of my config but I haven't counted LoC or anything.  Probably just my sense of it.
[15:08:07] <corwin> dcunit3d: I can see where that would be nice.  I don't even use virtual desktops.  I basically use Windows as a tiling OS via a rack of physical displays, some number of which contain emacs screens full-frame

[15:13:16] <dcunit3d> i'm hoping to offload a lot of what i'm doing to guix systems running as VM's where some of the projects/directories are syncd using syncthing. then i should be able to do things from various terminals using TRAMP from other systems. i would like to try remove as much of the window manager from things where i can.
[15:13:31] <dcunit3d> it makes things too complicated.

[15:14:51] <dcunit3d> this approach is complicated, but as long as i don't need org-agenda across all my files/buffers, then i should have a more portable workflow where emacs can be single-threaded and it's not much of a problem.
[15:15:29] <dcunit3d> i haven't tried configuring emacs on a windows system yet though. i don't know nearly enough about the Linux subsystem to try that.
[15:16:55] <dcunit3d> i may end up trying to use terminal-only emacs via GNU screen instead of tramp... then i should be able to connect to systems via VPN from wherever and reconnect to the GNU screen session. at least that's the idea, but it's taking me forever to get moving

[22:33:18] <kiki_lamb>  I wish there were a way to do something like an inverted version of org-babel, where I could arbitrarily use org-mode inside of comments inside of files that use some other language and major mode. It seems like maybe I could achieve it using poly-mode if I studied it a bit more? But if it's that easy, I'm surprised no one else did it first...
[22:33:55] <acdw> I feel like i've heard of that somehwere.... what would you want to do with it tho?
[22:34:06] <acdw> like, you /can/ write org-mode comments, but what do you want to do with them?

[22:35:09] <kiki_lamb> At work I can't usually choose the language, they'll pay me $ if I give them C# code... if I could use org in the comments, that'd be awesome.

[22:36:43] <kiki_lamb> We just grabbed a new dev I can direct, and it sounds like they're also an emacs-er... so if I could get this working I could probably get the new guy on board, it might be a goof moment in time to try to add this to how we do things.

I've never been an OS loyalist, I've probably given MS OSes, Apple OSes and Linuxes each a decade as my primary OS, but spent at least a decade and half in emacs.
