[12:37:20] <MaNa2k> inceptionflywho, yes i tried that, but didnt get it to work, and cant find any good guides
[12:38:18] <inceptionflywho> MaNa2k, what are you trying to build? Why sftp over azure storage?
[12:38:28] <MaNa2k> yes
[12:39:06] <MaNa2k> bascialy, today when we want sftp for a user, we have to call this it supplier which literally takes up to 2weeks to set it up
[12:39:39] <MaNa2k> and very often they setup wrong even if we have spesified everything correctly
[12:39:53] <MaNa2k> once they were able to give root permision
[12:40:12] <MaNa2k> good thing i tested the user before delivering it to a customer
[12:40:20] <Nasp> Just dont use that supplier
[12:40:31] <inceptionflywho> There as SFTP service in AWS which quite easy to setup if your intention is to provision sftp on-demand https://aws.amazon.com/aws-transfer-family/
[12:40:33] <Nasp> Setup your own SFTP i nfront
[12:40:37] <MaNa2k> Nasp, well we are stuck with them, because they basically deliver everything
[12:40:53] <MaNa2k> and yes we are trying to change to a different, but these things take years
[12:41:16] <MaNa2k> well were only using azure
[12:42:18] <inceptionflywho> MaNa2k, in that case it is far easier to use thirdparty solutions in Azure. An example: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/thorntechnologiesllc.sftpgateway?tab=overview
[12:42:51] <inceptionflywho> It uses Azure Storage for persistence
[12:43:28] <MaNa2k> inceptionflywho, yes but dosnt those cost more than what its worth
[12:43:46] <inceptionflywho> I don't think so
[12:43:56] <Nasp> Looks cheap
[12:43:58] <inceptionflywho> It costs $63.24/mo
[12:44:07] <MaNa2k> pr user?
[12:44:15] <MaNa2k> or pr service?
[12:44:15] <inceptionflywho> and the Azure storage is your own cost which depends on how much you store
[12:44:19] <inceptionflywho> MaNa2k, no
[12:44:22] <inceptionflywho> per instance per month
[12:44:30] <MaNa2k> hmm
[12:44:30] <inceptionflywho> look at the Plans+Pricing tab
[12:44:36] <MaNa2k> ah
[12:44:45] <inceptionflywho> Also, this is what I found as first hit in my search
[12:44:52] <inceptionflywho> there may be better options out there. Do your own research.
[12:45:17] <inceptionflywho> But if I were you, I would use something like this to save time, money and complexity
[12:45:20] <Nasp> Also who us the enduser of this SFTP?
[12:45:20] <MaNa2k> hmm, the cheapest is 4gb disk
[12:45:26] <Nasp> Like couldn't they just send it through http?
[12:49:25] <inceptionflywho> Nasp, clients typically need a GUI and SFTP is established protocol for file transfers
[12:50:12] <kobo_> so my org have been doing these security quizes to all employees. With tutorials on how to check that links in emails go to the right url etc... now we've added so all links in mails get scanned and now all links redirects to urldefense.com haha
[12:51:27] <Nasp> inceptionflywho:  And http / S3 isnt?
[12:53:43] <inceptionflywho> Nasp, is there a client which one can install/use?

[13:07:37] <Babbage> getting an error?
[13:07:57] <MaNa2k> swensson, so what i see is you are tryign to deserialize your json to that object rootObject, but are you getting a null ?

[13:14:31] <inceptionflywho> swensson, what happens when you try to print getThatJson.hostname
[13:15:06] <inceptionflywho> You haven't stated the problem. Without looking at the raw json, it is not possible to say if it is mapping correctly to the model
[13:15:29] <swensson> Object does not contain a definition for hostname
[13:15:41] <inceptionflywho> is hostname present in the json?
[13:15:56] <swensson> Yeah 2sec I'll slim it down
[13:17:02] <swensson> https://dpaste.com/3WYYULQVD
[13:17:16] <MaNa2k> he probably needs to iterate through his object
[13:17:26] <MaNa2k> to access the field
[13:17:30] <inceptionflywho> swensson, it is an array
[13:19:46] <swensson> ?
[13:20:27] <MaNa2k> swensson, do a foreach over getThatJson

[13:26:52] <inceptionflywho> https://dotnetfiddle.net/FCrcI0
[13:27:10] <inceptionflywho> swensson, you have to deserialize to the array type

[13:35:28] <MaNa2k> swensson, you dont need the dump
[13:35:41] <MaNa2k> its just to print out the result in dotnetfiddle
[13:35:53] <MaNa2k> its their own internal extention method i think
[13:36:27] <MaNa2k> just do this....   var hostName = getThatJson.Select(tj => tj.hostname).FirstOrDefault();
[13:37:00] <swensson> Okey, removed that and using writeToFileinstaed.. But getting "Could not convert string to double: 10.7.2714. Path[73].Version

[13:57:56] <MaNa2k> the question is, is there really a point in vaccination? i mean it will probably just last fo 2 maybe 3 years, and then you will havet vaccinate again
[13:58:25] <Tobbi_> Yes
[13:58:32] <Tobbi_> Probably.

[13:59:43] <MaNa2k> *eating
[13:59:48] <inceptionflywho> it appears vaccinated people are at a lesser risk of corona related fatalities even if for a specific duration.
[14:00:25] <MaNa2k> theres lots of information and misinformation out there in the media\social
[14:00:36] <inceptionflywho> MaNa2k, then it is wise to get vaccinated.
[14:01:25] <inceptionflywho> It doesn't kill you ... and what doesn't kill makes you stronger! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
[14:01:36] <MaNa2k> maybe we should just let nature run its course, like it has always done, and let the storngest survie lol
[14:02:40] <inceptionflywho> I don't understand why in netherlands they don't have mandatory corona vaccination check in the offices
[14:03:05] <inceptionflywho> they should enforce it for everyone except those who can't take it for medical reasons

[14:05:42] <MaNa2k> anyone here worked on esri\gis\arcgis ?
[14:11:14] <jmer> Does EFcore 5 look at the InitialCreate migration when you add new migrations?

[16:15:29] <swensson8> var getTHatJson = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<rootObject>(responseFromServer); made the syntax getThatJson.hostname to work, but it provides theÂ  string rootObject.Hostname{get; set;}.... Not really sure on how to use that
[16:17:48] <inceptionflywho> swensson8, you should try here https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php

[16:20:30] <inceptionflywho> swensson8, try to go through the link I have given before you venture in any real programming. It is expected from you to know the basics. You are welcome here to ask questions when something doesn't work and you are out of ideas.
[16:21:25] <MaNa2k> i would also look at this site for basics https://www.dotnetperls.com/
[16:21:48] <MaNa2k> learned allot from that site about spesifics
[16:22:02] <inceptionflywho> MatthiasVance, do you mind adding this to the title: https://www.whathaveyoutried.com/
[16:23:47] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[16:23:48] <MatthiasVance> :D
[16:25:32] <Nasp> Is it possible to specify a "params" should be used with atleast one parameter?
[16:26:46] <inceptionflywho> Nasp, no. You can use Assertions though to validate.
[16:26:52] <Nasp> So no
[16:26:59] <Nasp> Thanks for telling me i can add a code check
[16:28:21] <MatthiasVance> You could create a type that would encapsulate that
[16:28:22] <Nasp> Foo(int id, params int[] ids) looks fugly just to enforce it's called atleast once
[16:28:38] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: What is your use case?
[16:29:14] <Nasp> I was wondering if some sort of nullability enable could enforce it
[16:29:25] <Nasp> Ohh just a collegue of mine who made that signature and i found it quite ugly
[16:29:30] <Nasp> But then i do see the reason for it
[16:30:20] <inceptionflywho> Nasp, encapsulate it with a type or use assertion https://stackoverflow.com/questions/129120/when-should-i-use-debug-assert
[16:31:16] <inceptionflywho> There might be other ways with dynamic injections using Fody but that won't be recommended.

[17:25:14] <Kim^J> MatthiasVance: It's against security practices though, split tunnelling should be avoided.
[17:25:41] <MatthiasVance> Doesn't that depend on the use case of the VPN?
[17:25:55] <MatthiasVance> As in, using VPN to get access to another network instead of securing all communications
[17:27:07] <Kim^J> Well, no
[17:28:31] <MatthiasVance> As a client I don't want to reroute all my internet traffic to your network just to access some servers
[17:28:37] <MatthiasVance> I'd say THAT could be a security issue
[17:29:15] <Kim^J> Why?
[17:29:59] <Kim^J> The thing is, if you allow the client to access stuff outside of the VPN, those could be used to attack the inside stuff

[21:53:07] <jonp> both single-quotes and double-quotes are allowed
[21:53:35] <jonp> the deserializer should remove the outermost quotes, as they're not part of the value, they delimit the value.

[23:31:18] <Suchiman> ki9a: whatchu mean, .NET Core does not do binding redirects, strong names are ignored and the first assembly with the same name to be loaded wins
[23:32:09] <Suchiman> if you have MyProject -> Nuget: Newtonsoft v13 and MyProject -> OtherProject -> Nuget: Newtonsoft v12 it should pick v13 automatically
[23:33:02] <ki9a> hm
[23:34:17] <Suchiman> ki9a: that is, if you reference the nuget from the executable project, if you have Executable -> Proj1 -> JSON v13 and Executable -> Proj2 -> JSON v12 then it should pick v13 i think but eventually if Executable has a direct dependency, then that one always wins
[23:34:55] <ki9a> I have <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
[23:35:54] <ki9a> dotnet publish -c Release -o ..\A
[23:36:00] <ki9a> ..\A has newtonsoft 9!
[23:36:22] <ki9a> It's like it picks a random one
[23:38:25] <Suchiman> ki9a: mhm... one thing that could fuck with the dependency conflict resolution is if one of the projects reference the newtonsoft assembly directly without nuget
[23:40:24] <ki9a> I think I have it
[23:40:31] <ki9a> publish -o publishes all projects
[23:40:36] <ki9a> one by one to ..\A
[23:41:21] <ki9a> so if 1 of them has the wrong newtonsoft (direct or indirect)
[23:41:28] <ki9a> you could easily end up with the wrong one
