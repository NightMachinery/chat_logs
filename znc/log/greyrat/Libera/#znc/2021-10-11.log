[20:22:04] <IceMichael> hello
[20:22:31] <IceMichael> I'm trying to use nginx reverse proxy for the irc-part of znc, so that I can put subdomain.mydomain.com into my IRC client
[20:22:50] <IceMichael> so not talking about web admin, talking about the irc part of znc
[20:23:18] <IceMichael> but as it is not https, it seems I need to use stream plugin. Then again, stream plugin does not seem to cope with subdomains... any idea?

[21:43:43] <r00tobo> afaik upstream work only with IP:ports but I believe you could just use server_name with it in the server block?
[21:44:17] <r00tobo> it's basically like a loadbalancer
[21:45:35] <r00tobo> I use the server_name option with upstream in a LB setup and it works fine
[21:45:43] <r00tobo> of course in the server block
[21:47:38] <r00tobo> have not tried it with znc irc setup though

[21:57:11] <IceMichael> I'm trying map with some $ssl_peread variables but no luck so far
[21:57:34] <IceMichael> server block for normal nginx works, of course, but not for stream
[22:05:37] <r00tobo> when I use different upstreams in http I specify a proxy_set_header Host if the upstreams are hosted in a vhost environment and it works
[22:05:55] <r00tobo> proxy_set_header Host $host
[22:05:58] <r00tobo> like this 
[22:07:06] <r00tobo> but in your case shouldn't be used because it's not http backend

[22:08:13] <r00tobo> I am reading on stream and seems it doesn't work with it at all
[22:10:25] <r00tobo> but whhy would you want to use a subdomain in the first place? just setup lets encrypt for a subdomain and use it with your stream config it should work fine 
[22:10:26] *** `Awoobis` is now known as Awoobis
[22:11:13] <r00tobo> if you want to use a different subdomain for another znc instance use a nother stream block with a different port
[22:15:38] <r00tobo> as long as you use the right cert for it ex. znc.example.com it should work, generally server_name is for web
[22:17:07] <IceMichael> r00tobo: but how to use stream for a subdomain?
[22:17:40] <r00tobo> see the SSL option in the wiki?
[22:17:50] <IceMichael> which one?
[22:17:52] <r00tobo> get a cert for that subdomain put it there
[22:18:01] <IceMichael> I have wildcard cert for everything, that's covered
[22:18:05] <r00tobo> https://wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy#IRC
[22:18:16] <IceMichael> that's missing the point
[22:18:16] <r00tobo>   # SSL options
[22:18:32] <IceMichael> I have my subdomains covered with certs, that's all fine
[22:18:43] <IceMichael> but how can I use the stream options ONLY for one subdomain?
[22:19:04] <IceMichael> I have different services running on that server
[22:19:15] <IceMichael> and all subdomains point to the same server, I need to dinstinguish stuff there, within nginx
[22:19:19] <r00tobo> I don't think you can, you have to just specify a different port for a different subdomain etc...
[22:19:32] <r00tobo> so 7000 for znc.example.com
[22:19:33] <IceMichael> that's not enough, though
[22:19:41] <IceMichael> port subdomain mapping only works for https
[22:19:43] <IceMichael> not for stream
[22:19:45] <r00tobo> I would just do that if it's not supported
[22:20:01] <IceMichael> how if it's not supported? :)
[22:20:16] <r00tobo> I mean if stream can't support per subdomain just like web/http does 
[22:20:46] <r00tobo> choose different ports per a subdomain and use a cert for that subdomain instead a wildcard 
[22:20:48] <MetaNova> IceMichael: I think he means do upstream znc{[..];} server{ location /znc/{ proxy_pass; listen 7000 ssl; etcetera } }
[22:21:06] <MetaNova> but I don't use nginx so that's just my guess
[22:21:53] <r00tobo> no without location MetaNova, just use a diffrent .stream file for each subdomain linked to a different port 
[22:22:05] <MetaNova> oh
[22:22:07] <r00tobo> that's the only option for now I mean
[22:22:41] <r00tobo> so the same config file example in the wiki but for different ports/subdomains
[22:22:44] <IceMichael> MetaNova: but that's not a subdomain
[22:22:56] <r00tobo> ssl_certificate         /etc/letsencrypt/live/znc.example.test/fullchain.pem;
[22:23:12] <r00tobo> you just replace these paths with your cert of a subdomain
[22:23:22] <r00tobo> irc clients should get it right and don't give errors
[22:23:27] <IceMichael> r00tobo: I don't get how different certs for different subdomains help here. I could just have the very same problem completely without ssl
[22:23:52] <IceMichael> so how should I map subdomains to ports, maybe that's the better question
[22:24:21] <IceMichael> for http(s), server_name would be the simple solution, but you mean something different?
[22:24:54] <r00tobo> from my looking on this stream plugin all it does is offloading TCP requests from nginx to the backend 
[22:25:00] <r00tobo> it doesn't know dns
[22:25:14] <r00tobo> or at least it might understand it if you use a resolver?
[22:25:39] <r00tobo> https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html
[22:25:48] <IceMichael> r00tobo: exactly, but backend is a port
[22:25:50] <r00tobo> https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html#resolver
[22:25:53] <r00tobo> check this
[22:25:54] <IceMichael> nowhere is the concept of subdomains covered
[22:26:03] <r00tobo>  Configures name servers used to resolve names of upstream servers into addresses
[22:26:06] <IceMichael> so question stands: how would you map subdomains to ports?
[22:26:16] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy#As_a_Subdomain ?
[22:26:29] <MetaNova> that's how you would do a subdomain for webadmin
[22:26:29] <IceMichael> MetaNova: covered, only works for http
[22:26:31] <IceMichael> that is webserver
[22:26:33] <r00tobo> if everything is inside one server I would use /etc/hosts
[22:26:46] <MetaNova> oh, I thought you were stating at all
[22:27:05] <IceMichael> no, irc, not webserver
[22:27:10] <IceMichael> irc, subdomain
[22:27:32] <IceMichael> I'm repeating myself many times now
[22:28:51] <IceMichael> so only way that seems to be working is using the ssl_preread module
[22:28:57] <IceMichael> trying to compile nginx myself with that option now
[22:29:44] <r00tobo> that's clever
[22:29:59] <r00tobo> allows extracting information from the ClientHello message without terminating SSL/TLS, for example, the server name requested through SNI or protocols advertised in ALPN. This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the --with-stream_ssl_preread_module configuration parameter. 
[22:30:21] <r00tobo> that's exactly what you are looking for
[22:30:33] <IceMichael> only way I see here
[22:30:48] <IceMichael> but nginx seems to be really shitty to be honest, if so much mess is necessary
[22:30:59] <IceMichael> building myself... no way to dynamically have this as plugin. gnah
[22:31:16] <r00tobo> it does... actually nginx is more of a web specific program 
[22:31:30] <r00tobo> it does load balancing and normal serving pretty good
[22:31:49] <IceMichael> yeah, I love it for that
[22:32:01] <IceMichael> but znc needing to meet irc protocol, well... makes it harder
