[00:17:43] <z6np-6w> my theory is that numbers get "denatured" the larger they become. less and less useful and more entropic
[00:17:46] <alphamule2> Like:  2 gives you 50% reduction if you ignore all numbers that are even, except 2.
[00:18:02] <alphamule2> That's kind of a verified theory, in general
[00:18:09] <z6np-6w> all the really exciting stuff seems to happen pretty close around zero
[00:18:28] <alphamule2> They follow the same issue as memory accesses not being linear.
[00:18:51] <alphamule2> In practice, on a computer, if you have a table, you assume one step per calculation using it.
[00:19:00] <alphamule2> Like, a cosine table.
[00:19:23] <z6np-6w> just the golden ratio and silver conjugates for your step size factor if possible
[00:19:23] <alphamule2> But for realllly large objects, the access times in fact get slower as you increase the size of the table.
[00:19:40] <alphamule2> Really interesting part is someone proved this in general, not just for caching
[00:19:57] <alphamule2> Or other way around:  caching is inevitable optimization
[00:20:36] <z6np-6w> alphamule2, if you are doing something that has steps then using fibonnaci relationship between steps makes a lot of sense
[00:20:52] <alphamule2> If they're accumalative, yes
[00:21:18] <z6np-6w> each step is a smooth jump
[00:21:37] <z6np-6w> the previous and next always appear to remain in proportion and are calculatable

[00:36:48] <alphamule2> See:  physics

And, of course, Fourier Transforms take any arbitrary signal and decompose it into sinusoidal components that are scalar multiples of each other, but different magnitude.

[02:41:21] <isekaijin> tusko: Fourier series are decompositions of periodic signals into sums of sinusoids. In many ways, these sinusoids behave like the “simplest constituent parts” of the original signal. For example, each sinusoid has a separate contribution to the energy of the signal - you can just compute the energy of each individual sinusoid, and then add them up.

From the formula (1/2)mv^2, where v^2 = (v_x)^2 + (v_y)^2 + (v_z)^2, you can see that you can separately consider the x,y,z components of the particle's velocity, compute the “kinetic energy along the corresponding axis”, and only then add them up.
[02:45:46] <isekaijin> Mathematically, the key is that the x, y, z axes are pairwise orthogonal.

[05:14:42] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that's gross.
[05:15:08] <PlanckWalk> It's not just unfortunate, it's internally inconsistent.

[05:30:56] <ski>     The notation of elementary school arithmetic, which nowadays everyone takes for granted, took centuries to develop.  There was an intermediate stage called syncopation, using abbreviations for the words for addition, square, root, etc.  For example Rafael Bombelli (c. 1560) would write
[05:31:02] <ski>       R. c. L. 2 p. di m. 11 L       for our       ∛{2 + 11⋅i} .

[05:31:31] <ski>     The logical calculus is easier to execute than any of the techniques of mathematics itself, yet only in 1934 did Gerhard Gentzen set it out in a natural way. Even now, mathematics students are expected to learn complicated (⌜ε⌝-⌜δ⌝)-proofs in analysis with no help in understanding the logical structure of the arguments. Examiners fully deserve the garbage that they get in return.

[05:50:16] <PlanckWalk> NO.  No no.  Nononono.
[05:50:25] <isekaijin> ski: Just introduce a relation composition operator and use it.
[05:50:40] <Galois> for example x = ± y is valid notation, and it doesn't mean leibniz equality
[05:51:15] <ski> well, typically i guess it'd be used when ⌜P(x,y)⌝ and ⌜Q(y,z)⌝ would be replaced by arbitrary expressions involving the relevant variables
[05:51:26] <isekaijin> Galois: Yeah, now I need that awesome functional analysis library for Coq.
[05:51:39] <Galois> I think Lean has some functional analysis?
[05:52:29] <isekaijin> It has to have, if the Lean guys managed to formalize the condensed mathematics nonsense.

[05:53:41] <Galois> but the thing is even if you just use it for a semester for baby algebra, it still alters your perspective of everything that comes later. You know what is possible and what is not, what is on solid footing and what is not.

[05:54:05] <isekaijin> Anyhow, my perception is that there's an unholy alliance between the n-people (the kind of people who write and/or understand the nLab) and the computer formalization people to replace all mathematics with abstract algebra.
[05:54:45] <isekaijin> The fact that this is possible is really cool, but actually carrying it out is violence.
[05:57:29] <isekaijin> You think analysts will stay quiet while algebraists torture beautiful real analysis theorems, based on actual physical intuition about what R^n is, into monstrous algebraic analogues?
[05:58:01] <pounce> dumb terminology nonse: are "vanishes simply" and "vanishes identically" equivalent?
[05:58:12] <isekaijin> No idea what you mean by “vanishes simply”.
[05:58:21] <pounce> yeah same
[05:58:26] <isekaijin> “Vanishes identically” has a standard meaning.

[06:09:45] <Jong> I'm having a hard time using ereaders over books. With ereaders or pdfs on the computer, I feel like I'm in a pitch black room and I just have a laser flashlight that lets me see at a small portion of the room at one time.   It's this blinding feeling. Like a horse with the peripheral vision blockers.

[06:11:44] <isekaijin> pounce: Oh, I don't think “vanishes simply” means “vanishes identically here”.

[06:13:25] <pounce> isekaijin:  i found the actual definition, you're right: https://litter.catbox.moe/seipip.png
[06:13:42] <isekaijin> Nice.
[06:13:53] <pounce> yep, my bad asuming this was standard notation
[06:14:09] <isekaijin> This stuff is secretly algebraic geometry.
[06:14:16] <isekaijin> Or at least has a lot of similarities with algebraic geometry.
[06:14:41] <ski> Galois : yea. learning type theory (and also then looking into deductive systems in logic) had that effect, on me
[06:14:42] <isekaijin> The zeroes and poles of a meromorphic function are hypersurfaces, and they can have multiplicity >= 1.
[06:14:53] <pounce> yeah, complex differential geometry feels like the playpen that the algebraic geometers left behind when they moved onto cooler things

[18:02:33] <Z-module> It's certainly in the nice book "Combinatorial Group Theory" by Lyndon & Schupp
[18:02:46] <joel135> although there are several possible conventions: (1, 2, 3), [1, 2, 3], {1, 2, 3}, 123

[18:08:07] <joel135> ProfSimm: i think that's an unfruitful path to go down
[18:08:39] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: It's acceptable to use the same notation for a value and a list consisting of just that value, but only as long as you recognize that it's an abuse of notation.

[18:09:40] <joel135> it is sort of analogous to asking questions that are specific to the base 10 number system
[18:09:44] <isekaijin> Strictly speaking, what you have is a canonical injection from the set of generators into the free monoid generated by this set. It's acceptable in math to write expressions as if applying this injection were a “nonstep”.
[18:10:34] <ProfSimm> joel135: it's prpblematic indeed. But somehow in C for example, a pointer to a scalar is identical to a pointer to an array of one scalar
[18:10:55] <joel135> good point
[18:11:03] <isekaijin> Well, C isn't exactly renowned for its ability to prevent you from saying nonsense.
[18:11:11] <ProfSimm> Sure
[18:11:36] <joel135> compare "int x" to "int* x" to "int** x"
[18:11:46] <joel135> (if i am remembering my c syntax right)

[18:12:10] <joel135> sure
[18:12:49] <joel135> these three types are distinct
[18:12:51] <Z-module> savask: Hmm, not sure I knew this part: Each countable group that is solvable of class k embeds in a 2-generated group that is solvable of class k + 2, and there is an abelian countable group not embeddable in a finitely generated metabelian group.,
[18:13:08] <joel135> which is similar to the fact that A, List(A), List(List(A)) are all distinct

[18:14:26] <joel135> *x is the default way to model lists

[18:15:58] <isekaijin> Actually, almost every language in use has this issue. Not C-specific.

[19:20:02] <biberao> hi
[19:21:06] <magic_ninja> And I'm seeing that the length elements for cylindrical are r, rdphi, dz. Am I correct in my thinking that, "If we are integrating some range, then we need to use that appropriate length element"
[19:21:11] <magic_ninja> hi biberao
[19:21:15] <biberao> sup
[19:21:33] <biberao> werent you the one doing the cylindrical coordinates yesterday?
[19:22:05] <magic_ninja> so if I'm just integrating phi and z, while holding r constant, then I want to use the elementary lengths for phi and z, or r * dphi * dz to get an area
[19:22:19] <biberao> too much for me
[19:22:21] <biberao> sorry
[19:22:35] <magic_ninja> yea, I'm doing an EM theory class. Taking a pause until I understand these elementary lengths. They seem pretty critical.
[19:22:41] <isekaijin> Both the physics and the math conventions for spherical coordinates are unusable and, therefore, wrong.
[19:22:48] <isekaijin> But the math one is slightly less wrong.
[19:23:07] <magic_ninja> I'll make sure to let me professor know you said he wrong lol.
[19:23:08] <isekaijin> Since it reuses the theta coordinate from the polar / cylindrical coordinate system.
[19:23:56] <isekaijin> Who in the **** thought it was a good idea to use the angle from the z axis, rather than from the xy plane, as the second angular coordinate?
[19:24:27] <isekaijin> It breaks the nice symmetry between “up” and “down”.
[19:24:33] <magic_ninja> dunno, don't care. It is what it is. I'm sure there was a reason, and I don't disagree, though.
[19:24:55] <isekaijin> Well, when you need to actually do lots of calculations, it matters.
[19:24:58] <magic_ninja> forces you to reverse sin and cos
[19:25:16] <isekaijin> You can rely less on your geometric intuition if you have less symmetries available.

[19:26:32] <magic_ninja> When switching to cylindrical and polar coordinates.
[19:27:01] <magic_ninja> Basically, if I'm integrating across that direction, I need to use it's elementary length.
[19:27:47] <magic_ninja> If the integral is some range for phi and r, I need to use rdphi, dr and z would be constant
[19:27:58] <magic_ninja> Or if I'm integrating across r and z, I would use dr, dz and phi would be constant
[19:28:11] <magic_ninja> or if all three, dr, rdphi, dz

[21:56:59] <gurkenglas> bollu: uhh not specifically. if i tried to understand gram matrices i'd try to relate them to what i've been doing recently: when you feed a normal distribution with covariance matrix M through the linear function given by the rectangular matrix J (also works for differentiable functions if you think locally), you get a normal distribution with covariance matrix JMJ*
[21:57:57] <Cera> Does coordinate-free mean whatever mathematical work there is may work in any coordinate system?
[21:58:12] <gurkenglas> If you can pick M, M=I is simple. You can try modelling the effect of computers having finite precision by adding epsilon*I to the output covariance matrix, if someone can see the nice math hidden there do tell me

[22:47:53] <gurkenglas> isekaijin, g(x,y,z)=(e^(x/2),e^(y/2,e^(z/2)) and h(x)=log(2x)
[22:49:06] <isekaijin> What I actually had in mind was g(x,y,z) = (e^x, e^y, e^z), h(t) = log(t), and f(x,y,z) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). I got the domains and codomains completely wrong, though.
[22:49:32] <gurkenglas> then f should just be x+y+z
[22:49:55] <isekaijin> Maybe I messed a few things up.
[22:50:05] <gurkenglas> why are you bringing up sqrtsumsquare? :D
[22:50:28] <isekaijin> “sqrtsumsquare”... just call it “Euclidean norm” like most people do.
[22:50:47] <isekaijin> Because the Euclidean norm is actually a pretty natural thing to consider in many contexts.
[22:51:03] <isekaijin> You can see yourself using it in lots of places in physics and math.
[22:51:15] <gurkenglas> sure but why are you bringing it up *here*
[22:52:04] <isekaijin> Because I'm trying to interpret your seemingly ad hoc function log(e^(2x) + e^(2y) + e^(2z)) / 2 as “something actually natural, but in a different coordinate system”.
[22:52:28] <gurkenglas> Ooh! Yes now bringing that up makes sense.

[22:54:18] <gurkenglas> adhoc = log . "Euclidean norm" . exp, sure.
[22:54:36] <isekaijin> Oh, just replace e^(2x) with |e^x|^2.
[22:55:16] <isekaijin> So log . euclideanNorm . map modulus . map exp.
[22:55:25] <isekaijin> Or log . euclideanNorm . map exp . map realPart.
[22:55:52] <gurkenglas> adhoc = log . sum . map (times complex conjugate) . exp
[22:56:15] <isekaijin> Actually, to get the minus sign in one of the components, replace euclideanNorm with minkowskiNorm.
[22:56:26] <isekaijin> That's why I also mentioned the Minkowski norm before.
[22:56:52] <gurkenglas> dang i missed that (see it now)

[23:02:36] <isekaijin> I can only suspect that you're passing to logarithmic scale because you're working with quantities so huge that working in ordinary linear scale doesn't make sense.
[23:03:58] <isekaijin> So, mostly out of consideration to the limitations of computers, rather than due to an intrinsic need of the original physical problem you're modeling.
[23:08:05] <gurkenglas> isekaijin: entropy of the normal distribution with covariance matrix I+JJ*=I+J*J is pretty much logdet(I+J*J)/2"=realpartof(logdet(i+J))" if that makes sense
[23:10:06] <gurkenglas> i agree that logsumexp has an easier time getting picked up by computer people because of that utility, but it does seem appropriate here.
[23:10:54] <gurkenglas> afaic people originally invented log out of consideration to the limitations of human ability to multiply numbers :D
[23:12:23] <gurkenglas> ("I+JJ*=I+J*J" is of course meant in the sense that their determinants are equal)
[23:12:45] <isekaijin> So I+JJ* and I+J*J needn't be themselves equal?
[23:13:12] <isekaijin> I originally thought that you meant J to be a normal matrix.
[23:13:13] <gurkenglas> they don't, = was a poor choice of symbol just now.
[23:13:31] <gurkenglas> J is an arbitrary mxn matrix
[23:13:46] <isekaijin> \Oh.
[23:13:48] <isekaijin> Okay.
