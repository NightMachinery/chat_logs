[00:22:58] *** Parts: chan (~chan@176.232.181.137) ()
[00:23:59] <AmalLight> _var go or javascript ?
[00:24:07] <AmalLight> XD
[00:24:13] <teus> ive watched higurashi sotsu
[00:24:28] <teus> not a lot of nipaa in that run
[00:25:03] <teus> it mostly had gore, plenty of it
[00:25:20] <teus> amigojapan: oh, youre actually in japan
[00:25:28] <amigojapan> AmalLight: I've never seen underscore var in JavaScript
[00:25:41] <amigojapan> Yeah teus
[00:25:52] <teus> its pretty rare to meet people on IRC who arent from west-EU or north america
[00:25:53] <_var> AmalLight: Why the question? XD But huh, javascript even tho I don't think using an underscore is specific to it
[00:25:54] <AmalLight> teus higurashi sotsu is it splatter ?
[00:26:15] <teus> the show isnt about splatter
[00:26:26] <teus> its a very complex story spanning several seasons
[00:26:29] <amigojapan> teus: I have been in Japan for 20 years 
[00:26:36] <AmalLight> _var i thought it was for renaming in the first positions
[00:26:39] <AmalLight> the _
[00:27:00] <teus> amigojapan: how fluent do you speak japanese
[00:27:06] <AmalLight> _var usually i am never used the _ also when is possible
[00:27:27] <AmalLight> *it was done
[00:27:29] <_var> well I use the _ to mark private variables/functions in whatever language I use
[00:27:39] <AmalLight> python yes
[00:28:13] <AmalLight> now i remember , but in true i don't believe too much in the private code
[00:28:16] <teus> supposedly you can live in japan for 20 years, speak it well, do your best to integrate, but you still remain second rate as a gaijin
[00:28:23] <AmalLight> so for that i never used
[00:29:22] <AmalLight> *in private code
[00:29:22] <amigojapan> _var: ruby uses @var for private variables, but it is a strict rule, not a convention like in python
[00:29:57] <AmalLight> mm i never tested if it works well to be honest
[00:30:10] <AmalLight> ( for python i meant )
[00:30:22] <AmalLight> I love C <3
[00:30:31] <AmalLight> all should be open
[00:30:41] <_var> yeah it's just a convention, it doesn't prevent people to use your stuff anyways, but it's just to mark that I don't expect them to use it in the class/object
[00:31:05] <AmalLight> yes i understand
[00:31:10] <AmalLight> it's logical
[00:31:47] <amigojapan> In ruby you can't use @vars as public properties
[00:32:11] <AmalLight> some times people install python packages in docker for manipulate it from /var folder XD
[00:32:39] <AmalLight> so the variable if available from the source code could be hacked
[00:32:57] <AmalLight> *python's
[00:33:39] <AmalLight> I like also [R] to be honest
[00:34:24] <NotNew> have any of u guys tried those text to code websites
[00:34:25] <AmalLight> backtrack done perfectly using it
[00:34:27] <NotNew> does it really work
[00:34:55] <NotNew> can i create my program without using think
[00:35:13] <amigojapan> AmalLight: one of phython's problems is a lack of strict rules. Like that of on spaces and tabs
[00:35:13] <NotNew> my think are not veri strong
[00:35:25] <AmalLight> mm interesting NotNew
[00:35:50] <AmalLight> i think it's possible but usually a mini-language using a lot of recursion
[00:36:00] <AmalLight> so it's could be slowly
[00:36:17] <NotNew> but still it could work eh
[00:36:32] <AmalLight> yes you've right

[00:42:01] <emmeka> we forget that Japan is a big country that runs north-south for many hundreds of km, at its southern fringes it has a tropical climate and at its northern fringes, a subpolar one
[00:42:11] <AmalLight> Roey i forget :(

[00:50:22] <NotNew> you mean the fynbos
[00:50:30] <emmeka> all angiosperm plantlife can be broadly classified into 6 regions of similar evolutionary trajectory on earth.
[00:50:39] <emmeka> 1 of them occurs only on the Cape of South Africa.
[00:50:51] <emmeka> the Cape Floral Kingdom. Plantlife there is unique from the rest of the world.
[00:51:29] <NotNew> I know the honey bees of the cape is unique as well, every worker bee is equivalent to a queen bee in that it can lay female unfertilized eggs (diploid?) 
[00:51:40] <amigojapan> NotNew: but anyway, if you come to Japan you will realise many things in anime are not really accurate. The thing that got me the most, was that I thought it would be easy to make many friends in Japan cause people were friendly, but that is very far from accurate
[00:53:16] <NotNew> emmeka, thats pretty interesting, so its like a little ecosystem of its own
[00:53:23] <AmalLight> Roey where do you come from?
[00:53:31] <amigojapan> Anime characters always seem to be meeting interesting people

[01:03:59] <emmeka> NotNew but yeah, South Africa is entirely within the southern subtropical zone, the horse lattitudes between the tropic of capricorn and the southern polar wind cells. The high pressure and lack of temperature convections at those lattitudes does strange things

[05:35:03] <TsundereNoises> heretics gonna heretic I guess
[05:35:31] <ButterNoodle> u ever talk to a dub watcher?

[05:40:24] <TsundereNoises> ACKTUALLY Japanese isn't a tonal language either, despite the existince of pitch accent

[05:40:31] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: what really
[05:40:43] <TsundereNoises> yeah, the way it's used is different than languages like Chinese

[05:46:25] <sscout> emmeka or anyone knows the novel this manhua is based on? https://koreanwebtoons.fandom.com/wiki/Devil_Sword_King
[05:46:25] <DaPinkOne> TomVoid, there are some workarounds for that. I paste gifs as links sometimes, and some people use "theLounge" which has gifs display
[05:46:25] <ImoutoBot> [title] Devil Sword King | Korean Webtoons Wiki | Fandom
[05:46:28] <emmeka> the manga is Love Me For Who I Am. I say "of incredible provenance" because the manga is a wholesome, sfw romance series about sexual minorities that is handled relatively seriously... that is a spinoff of a hentai doujin
[05:46:30] <ButterNoodle> TomVoid: they are using ircV4 protocol on efnet now with inline gifs
[05:46:35] <MootPoot> what if they made a manga that was entirely made of gifs
[05:46:36] <emmeka> as in, the hentai doujin is the original source material
[05:46:51] <ButterNoodle> oh
[05:46:54] <emmeka> and the mangaka made a wholesome officially published spinoff featuring the hentai doujin characters
[05:46:55] <ButterNoodle> I remember that one emmeka 
[05:46:56] <MootPoot> WOAH
[05:46:59] <MootPoot> HENTAI SOURCE
[05:47:00] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: you had me at wholesome
[05:47:06] <MootPoot> emmeka: you had me at hentai
[05:47:08] <ButterNoodle> ane naru mono
[05:47:13] <ButterNoodle> had a better hentai source
[05:47:15] <sscout> isn't the ircV3 still on alpha?
[05:47:19] <ButterNoodle> and non hentai adaptation
[05:47:27] <emmeka> TsundereNoises MootPoot in this case, I must in good faith recommend you read the hentai doujin first

[05:47:38] <ButterNoodle> did u get my 2 laters?

[05:47:52] <MootPoot> oh
[05:48:01] <MootPoot> I thought you said yuri
[05:48:08] * MootPoot scrolls up
[05:48:16] <emmeka> I said the series contains yuri. and it does.
[05:48:22] <emmeka> it is not yuri in focus
[05:48:26] <sscout> wait, the hentai is yaoi but the wholesome manga is yuri?
[05:48:35] <MootPoot> which chapter has yuri so I can skip to it
[05:48:41] <sscout> that's an unusual spinoff
[05:48:45] <MootPoot> and ignore the rest
[05:48:57] <TomVoid> DaPinkOne, oh so not all is lost then. much potential here
[05:49:04] <emmeka> the wholesome manga focused on a non-binary main love interest, but there is also a gay girl and romance drama involving her

[05:53:28] <MootPoot> in and let out
[05:53:32] <MootPoot>  = let out inside
[05:53:33] <emmeka> to elaborate a bit: the original doujin is about a gay guy who dresses as a girl to get the attention of the boy he likes, he's not trans. The wholesome manga series has that couple as major characters, but instead the main characters are a non-binary person and another guy. Other characters include a few transgirls, one straight otokonoko, some lesbians, so on so forth.
[05:53:36] <MootPoot> I think thats how it is
[05:53:52] <sscout> emmeka, did they make a full manga spinoff from a 3 chapter doujin?
[05:53:53] <MootPoot> woah
[05:53:58] <emmeka> sscout yes.
[05:54:00] <MootPoot> emmeka: I can get behind hetro traps

[05:54:10] <TsundereNoises> I want more manga spinoffs of hentai actually
[05:54:19] <TsundereNoises> just on principle
[05:54:31] <MootPoot> I've recently developed a knees and elbows fetish
[05:54:35] <MootPoot> dont know why
[05:54:38] <emmeka> sscout and the doujin characters main characters aren't just in the background, they're major characters in a wholesome romance plot.
[05:54:56] <beaky> craving the healthy joints of a cute girl
[05:55:19] <beaky> but what about armpit fetish
[05:55:22] <emmeka> MootPoot if you squint a bit I guess a relationship involving an enby character is basically hetero
[05:55:23] <MootPoot> emmeka: quick tax question
[05:55:33] <emmeka> if that puts your pp at ease
[05:55:41] <MootPoot> if you take EI and you make under that 67k something threshold for repayment
[05:56:00] <emmeka> huh? threshold?
[05:56:26] <MootPoot> afaik its something like if you take EI - then if you make above 67k in that year you have to pay back 30% of your EI income
[05:56:50] <MootPoot> I very much didnt make 67k last year but it still says on my t4 the repayment rate is like 30%
[05:56:51] <emmeka> news to me. then again, I don't make more than $67k...
[05:56:52] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: [Chorimokki] Gessha 20-man no Katei Kyoushi and [peachpulsar (Mira)] Musume no Kanojo
[05:56:58] <ButterNoodle> *you wont be disappointed
[05:57:33] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: if it puts your pp at ease, wouldn't that make it bad hentai?
[05:57:45] <emmeka> MootPoot I wouldn't worry about it, then? file your taxes, declare the EI income, and if the feds want their money back, don't worry, they'll let you know...
[05:58:09] <MootPoot> I dont have a job, am I supposed to take EI and then pay them back the same money
[05:58:10] <MootPoot> lmao
[05:58:24] <ButterNoodle> ??
[05:58:35] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I'll take a look at them and get back to you later
[05:58:36] <MootPoot> I think last year I made maybe 20k  or 25 all in
[05:59:07] <ButterNoodle> that makes no sense MootPoot..
[05:59:17] <ButterNoodle> thats like a poor tax
[05:59:59] <emmeka> checking quickly, the actual rule is this: the threshold for 2021 is 70,375, and, if you earn more than that, you have to pay back *the lesser of* 30% of your income *in excess of 70,375*, or the total of your EI benefits.
[06:00:05] <MootPoot> its something like if you have a job, you pay employment insurance , then if you claim it, and then if you make more then 67k afterwards you have to pay back 30% of what you took from employment insurance
[06:00:14] <ButterNoodle> thats fucked up
[06:00:25] <ButterNoodle> u have to pay back last years EIC?
[06:00:30] <Sapphirus> welcome to canada
[06:00:39] <MootPoot> if you make more then a certain amount
[06:00:51] <ButterNoodle> and I though the US was bad about enabling people to stay poor
[06:00:52] <ButterNoodle> fuck
[06:00:56] <sscout> emmeka: the hentai is 5+ years old, is the manga new?
[06:00:58] <emmeka> 30% of your net income, to boot.
[06:01:13] <Matt|home> i can't take it. first thing dad says to me as i come home is 'i might need to go to the hospital'. im high and i can't fucking drive. then he gets all coy and shit saying he won't call anyone if i can't drive. what the fuck.
[06:01:13] <emmeka> sscout new-ish. the official English release just finished.
[06:01:20] <ButterNoodle> ur penalized for taking aide more or less
[06:01:24] <MootPoot> emmeka: I dont follow
[06:01:25] <sscout> ah
[06:01:34] <emmeka> MootPoot you don't need to, don't worry about it.
[06:01:43] <emmeka> it doesn't apply, just file your taxes.
[06:01:45] <MootPoot> so if you make more then 70k, then you have to pay back 30% of what you owe, or 30% of your income from 70k
[06:02:08] <sscout> Matt|home: just call an uber and grab your dad's "dildo in the butt" insurance <3
[06:02:12] <emmeka> no, you have to pay either the totality of EI benefits or 30% of your after-tax income above 70k, whichever is lower.

[06:02:22] <MootPoot> ah

[09:16:45] <DunceCotus> Oh?
[09:17:09] <emmeka> it's a pioneer species, wholly shade intolerant. aspen stands colonize disturbed land, but then shade-tolerant species grow in their understory and eventually overtake the aspen

[09:25:28] <emmeka> like I can almost forgive Funi and Crunchyroll for the occasional or even regular typo or error or less than ideal typesetting considering they tend to simulcast everything same day as Japanese release, so whatever, I can forgive a bit given the speed at which they operate.
[09:25:44] <emmeka> but what's Netflix's excuse? they take forever to release any series, and then fuck it up anyway
[09:26:16] <Sapphirus> Netflix isn't even worth the price with all the shit they shovel
[09:26:21] <emmeka> at least Funi/Crunchy tend to fix all their subs and do proper typesetting for later bluray releases
[09:26:49] <emmeka> Sapphirus I mean just on principle ever since they literally straightwashed fucking Evangelion, I won't give them a dime.
[09:27:00] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I can't, their shitty subs and people copying them dominate, and for more niche shows sometimes that means there are never good subs
[09:27:02] <emmeka> of all the things they could've done
[09:27:13] <TsundereNoises> and funi/crunchy tend to have more errors on more niche shows
[09:27:31] <TsundereNoises> and do things like not sub plot-relevant songs, etc
[09:28:23] <emmeka> TsundereNoises the key is wait for the blurays. With Crunchyroll, that day may never come. But Funimation at least does in fact fix their subs (at least typos) and do proper typesetting for bluray releases.
[09:28:45] <emmeka> and tends to go back and do the songs properly too

[09:43:02] <MootPoot> what exactly is "serious liberties"

[12:50:17] <MootPoot> I was comparing via overall, not a specific model vs model

[14:47:38] <MootPoot> I hate python syntax
[14:47:59] <MootPoot> TIL it uses indentation instead of parenthesis 
[14:51:36] <amigojapan> MootPoot: if you did not know python used indentation instead of curly braces, you did not know python at all
[14:52:14] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the advantage is that it forces indentation
[14:54:26] <MootPoot> I mean, I never really said I knew python though
[14:54:36] <MootPoot> I know PHP and C#
[14:54:55] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:55:07] <MootPoot> also, that's not a advantage  - your text editor / IDE should already be handling that for you 
[14:55:21] <MootPoot> its actually a disadvantage - it prevents script minification
[14:55:46] <MootPoot> JS can be minified in ways python cant - smaller files
[14:56:08] <amigojapan> There are tools for minification. Even one space counts in python

[17:09:00] <HubertFarnsworth> what about the 32 bit mcs now? how do you code them Sadale? C?
[17:09:06] <Sadale> yep
[17:09:22] <Sadale> I actually don't like C++. Too complex. Too many feature that I won't ever be using.
[17:09:26] <HubertFarnsworth> I see.
[17:09:47] <Sadale> And C has better support for most models of microcontrollers, including compiling and debugging
[17:10:01] <HubertFarnsworth> but you can write in C++ for these 32 bit mcs right Sadale?
[17:10:22] <Sadale> Depends on which microcontroller you're using.
[17:10:35] <Sadale> I haven't look into that. AFAIK tho some microcontroller doesn't have C++ compilers for them.
[17:10:57] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I'm not sure if I remember correctly, they said it's better and also efficient to use C++ on these mcs.
[17:11:06] <HubertFarnsworth> ohh
[17:12:45] <Sadale> I haven't tested that. I *guess* that C code would be more efficient. But I really haven't tested that because I just don't bother using C++ for microcontroller programming :P (except for Arduino tho, which's C++)
[17:14:05] <MootPoot> can you use C++ and C libraries together?
[17:14:49] <HubertFarnsworth> only if you use C++ compiler
[17:14:57] <HubertFarnsworth> yes, I think you can
[17:14:57] <MootPoot> hmm
[17:15:17] <MootPoot> might do that then since 1.) no garbage collection 2.) I can still utilize C++ for desktop dev

[19:48:20] <sentionics> I really need to start doing those wrist exercises to build them back up, but I always procrastinate
[19:48:44] <JesseDesu> Her guitar is a Gibson Pre-'08 Les Paul Standard '50s in Heritage Cherry Sunburst. She names it Giita, which quite literally means "guitar". In 2008, Gibson gave the "Standard" name to a new design of Les Paul, while the old Standard was renamed the Traditional; worth noting because the manga started in 2007. She uses D'Addario EXL145 strings on it, oddly heavy strings for her and the music she plays.
[19:48:58] <sentionics> I get away with it and continue my career thanks to my awesome keyboard (and heavy hotkey usage), but I'm not getting younger
[19:49:50] <sentionics> I want to play my guitar regularly again. I need to stop fooling around.

[19:54:37] <sentionics> I'm great if I know the stuff, but when it comes to learning new stuff, I suck.
