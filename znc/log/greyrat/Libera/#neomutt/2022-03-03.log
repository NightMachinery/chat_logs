[14:06:56] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[14:07:45] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:09:19] * gahr learning new things about LanguageClient-neovim
[14:09:27] <gahr> works with plain vim too, and it's great
[14:10:41] <flatcap> oh!  those sort of things always seem to promise SO much, but seem to take a day's effort building them
[14:14:10] <olebra> gahr: any advantages to using that instead of the built-in LSP support?
[14:17:18] <gahr> oh I didn't know vim had built-in LSP support
[14:17:31] <olebra> gahr: only neovim
[14:17:35] <gahr> I see
[14:17:42] <gahr> I use good ol'vim
[14:18:07] <gahr> flatcap: this one comes with pre-built binaries on github
[14:18:15] <gahr> just clone the repo + the binary and you're good to go :)
[14:18:22] <gahr> I was impressed by the ease
[14:18:49] <flatcap> ok, cool.  I'll give it a go
[14:18:59] <olebra> ah, that's compelling
[14:20:07] <olebra> i use vim on the servers i have access to (which all run debian) and neovim on my own machine
[14:20:58] <olebra> i don't think the neovim version in debian stable is new enough to have LSP support anyway

[14:23:28] <flatcap> gahr: I've pushed a fix [devel/reply] to #3274 -- not my finest work, but it does the trick
[14:23:29] <neo-bot> Issue by @klartext "Replying to mail in Mail/sent-mail - sometimes - results in Segfault": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3274
[14:24:54] <flatcap> it's the old freeing a "hidden" mailbox problem when we reply to an email, whilst in the $record mailbox (that isn't in the sidebar)
[14:25:57] <flatcap> I'll raise a PR if it fixes the OP's problem
[14:29:50] <gahr> that bug, again..
[14:30:44] <flatcap> yeah
[14:31:03] <gahr>  why doesn't it get opened = 2?
[14:31:14] <flatcap> well, a slight variant of it.  I think it was the postponed mailbox last time
[14:32:49] <flatcap> don't know.  anyway, opened=2 didn't make a difference because we were mailbox_free()ing the mailbox based on MB_HIDDEN
[14:33:49] <gahr> ah, right
[14:34:57] <gahr> the old problem of lifetime management of mailboxes
[14:35:02] <flatcap> yep
[14:35:02] <gahr> I think I have an issue for that :/
[14:35:19] <gahr> perhaps we could free it only if opened=1
[14:35:21] <gahr> or 0
[14:35:22] <flatcap> I'll get around to _that_ in the next phase of development :-)
[14:36:13] <gahr> sure
[14:36:19] <flatcap> sure.  I welcome improved fixes, but that's all I have time for
[14:37:16] <gahr> would a check for opened = 0 in mailbox_free suffice?
[14:37:39] <flatcap> probably...
[14:37:55] <flatcap> but any changes there could be hard to test

[14:39:22] <gahr> let me assert opened = 0 in mailbox_free and play around some :)

[14:41:55] *** Quits: mord0d (~mord0d@gateway/tor-sasl/mord0d) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[14:42:29] <gahr> yeah it triggers when sending from fcc w/o mailboxes

[14:47:42] * flatcap nods
[14:59:05] <gahr> so we sometimes need to check for opened == 0, to avoid closing a mailbox that's opened by something else
[14:59:23] <gahr> sometimes we want to check for hidden, to avoid free'ing a mailbox that's in the sidebar
[14:59:41] <gahr> sometimes we don't, like when we're quitting
[15:00:20] <flatcap> any other weird corner cases? :-)
[15:02:46] <gahr> I'm thinking of two reference counts
[15:03:01] <gahr> one for open, one for visible or something
[15:03:16] <gahr> mhhh
[15:05:38] <flatcap> oh
[15:06:27] *** Quits: weirdsmiley (~weirdsmil@103.25.231.102) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:06:42] <gahr> or perhaps we never free a visible mailbox
[15:06:51] <gahr> and we mark all of them as invisible before we shut down neomutt
[15:11:18] * flatcap wonders how many mailboxes a power user might have, and how much memory each would use...
[15:11:35] <flatcap> probably not _that_ many and not _that_ much
[15:14:41] <gahr> #3282
[15:14:42] <neo-bot> PR by @gahr "Make free'ing a mailbox easier for the caller": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3282
[15:14:45] <gahr> for discussion :)
[15:14:53] <flatcap> cool
[15:15:06] <flatcap> is there any advantage to keeping the $record mailbox in-memory, if it's not use?
[15:15:48] <gahr> why would it be?
[15:20:07] *** Joins: weirdsmiley (~weirdsmil@103.25.231.102)
[15:22:01] <flatcap> is there any attribute/data of a Mailbox that would be useful to preserve when it gets closed?
[15:23:26] <flatcap> something that might save us time if/when it gets reopened
[15:25:36] <gahr> I guess only under the assumption that it isn't modified :)
[15:26:27] <flatcap> yeah, clearly the emails have to be freed
[15:26:54] * flatcap looks at Mailbox and ImapMboxData......
[15:27:48] <flatcap> the only thing I can think of is something we don't support yet -- Mailbox-specific config

[15:37:23] <dcpurton> I still don't use a GUI package manager
[15:52:34] <flatcap> dcpurton: if we have a Metadata file, does it need to be in the root of the project?
[15:52:38] * flatcap hopes not
[15:53:23] <dcpurton> You could put it anywhere in the src tree. I'd put these things in contrib.
[15:53:28] <dcpurton> It's only relevant at install
[15:53:33] <dcpurton> and for packaging
[15:53:40] <flatcap> ok, good
[15:53:56] <dcpurton> the metadata goes in /usr/share/metadata
[15:54:16] <dcpurton> s/metadata/metainfo/
[15:55:17] <dcpurton> it seems like its mainly used for package managers if you wanted to control what they say
[15:56:17] <dcpurton> rather than leaving it up to the various distro package maintainers
[15:57:00] <dcpurton> for example, I doubt the Debian description has been updated more than once and may no longer reflect what you want to say about the project
[15:57:17] <flatcap> fair enough
[16:02:55] <dcpurton> This is the current Debian descripton: https://packages.debian.org/sid/neomutt
[16:03:40] <flatcap> ok

[18:14:57] <dcpurton> flatcap: I just noticed something odd with the indicator colouring with contrib/samples/sample.neomuttrc and the new colouring code
[18:15:18] <dcpurton> with older versions there is just coloured -> at the beginning of each line
[18:15:38] <dcpurton> but with new code sometimes the whole line (except for one cell) is highlighted
[18:16:07] <dcpurton> not sure if this is with configuration or some unexpected side effect of new code

[18:17:27] <dcpurton> actually I can't even see how this kind of indicator is configured
[18:17:41] <dcpurton> but it's a bit late for me to investigate noe :)
[18:18:50] <flatcap> ok, I see what's going on
[18:19:11] <dcpurton> cool
[18:19:41] <flatcap> we're missing a check for arrow_cursor and mistakenly colouring the whole line
[18:20:28] <flatcap> the missing square is always blank, it's a hard-coded space after $arrow_string

[21:16:11] <flatcap> ok
[21:19:17] <gahr> fixed :)
[21:19:32] <gahr> question: I can either flags = MB_HIDDEN in account_mailbox_remove
[21:19:44] <gahr> so when I kill the account I force the deletion of its mailboxes
[21:19:52] <gahr> or I can add a bool force flat to mailbox_free
