[18:59:45] <mnemon> sunsnow?
[19:00:05] <pussipupu> if I ever meet wolves or bears I'll probably die from trying to hug them
[19:00:10] <pussipupu> and honestly I'm comfortable with that
[19:04:16] <mnemon> lucky for you they're usually very skittish around humans then :)

[19:51:53] <arryana> i had two wolves over the years.  neither was skittish
[19:52:15] <arryana> the first was so mellow that she was nearly inert
[19:53:11] <arryana> and yeah, sunsnow.  it was dumping snow and the sun came out, while it continued to dump snow
[20:05:02] <mnemon> arryana: I mean the wild ones, any that get too used to humies generally get shot

[22:38:03] <gb73d> Who you are is where you are.
[22:38:42] <iryith> ?
[22:38:51] <gb73d> If you would ask yourself who am I ? ask yourself where are you. That is the answer.

[23:43:30] <Delf> xx: How old or rather, how young can an individual be before they can be considered "old enough" to commit suicide?
[23:44:58] <ProfSimm> Delf: so you're just a set of relations
[23:44:59] <blkshp> Surely that should be based on their individual maturity levels and circumstances.
[23:46:18] <Delf> Part of me is part of me is not
[23:47:46] *** Quits: SGautam (uid286066@id-286066.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[23:49:23] <Delf> How do you tell how mature someone is? I'm going to assume that circumstances is merely a situation from which improvement is "too difficult"
[23:49:33] <xx> Delf: it's up to the individual, I wouldn't place any restriction on it. Probably best to educate them about what suicide means first.
[23:50:03] <Delf> Do you mind educating me?
[23:50:30] <ProfSimm> What does it mean to be mature
[23:51:20] <Delf> Suicide means you can't regret it, even if you wish you had. Are you sure you want to commit? Quick! Make a decision before you change your mind and don't commit!
[23:52:05] <Delf> If the education takes you at least a life time, then I'm all for committing suicide :)
[23:52:37] <Delf> Commit suicide, after you've been educated (requires at least a lifetime) on what death means
[23:52:49] <ProfSimm> Delf: implies we know what death is
[23:53:00] *** Quits: saufa (~saufa@m91-129-102-64.cust.tele2.ee) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:53:37] <Delf> We've only had second hand experiences of it, ProfSimm
[23:54:03] <xx> I'd just describe suicide as "you go to sleep and never wake up again, are you ok with that?"
[23:54:39] <ProfSimm> Delf: well then I propose I see it first hand and come back to tell you
[23:54:40] <Delf> That's your belief rather. You must admit to yourself that you actually have no idea what it is like, to be dead
[23:54:55] <iryith> there was a good documentary called The Bridge that went into suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge, and it basically confirmed what I thought all along that when you actually jump off you realize this was a dumb fucking idea
[23:54:59] <Delf> ProfSimm: Please don't, it would scare the shits out of me
[23:55:24] <iryith> they interviewed some survivors, if that wasn't obvious
[23:55:29] <ProfSimm> Delf: technically we don't know what life is when we're born either, but we go through it regardless
[23:55:58] <Delf> ProfSimm: Yes, we only experience so little of it
[23:56:21] <Delf> If you've ever had a "dream" where you've been alive, you'd wake up to knowing that you're not quite alive yet
[23:56:37] <ProfSimm> Delf: my point is, imagine you were something before you were alive. And you had to make a choice to be born. All your bros were like "don't do it, none of us know what it's like"
[23:57:16] <Delf> Previous lives?
[23:57:26] <Delf> Don't do it, you'll forget us!
[23:58:13] <ProfSimm> Delf: maybe instead of being reborn in higher and higher life-forms, the death of a spirit is being reborn into lower and lower lifeforms. So you were some advanced alien race previously, now you're a human. Next time you'll be a wild pig, then a frog, then a fly, and so on until your consciousness ceases to exist as a single particle.
[23:59:33] <ProfSimm> Delf: you said you exist as a set of relations to other things. This is what you lose when you die. It's not about you. But about all your relations.
