[00:47:00] <acdw> hi circe-ers, has there been an update lately or anything that might make circe hang on connection? I updated my packages and now circe is hanging for all but one server i connect to.
[00:47:12] <acdw> or maybe those servers have updated IRC or someting?
[00:47:49] <bremner> Still running circe 2.11 here, probably no help
[00:48:43] <acdw> i'm on 2.11 as well
[00:48:59] <acdw> it's probably something i'm doing wrong, bleh
[00:49:31] <acdw> the annoying part is, when i kill (or try to kill) the connection the entire emacs hangs up and i have to kill -9 it, or i'd be more willing to dig in

[01:07:45] <acdw-> hi i was able to join finally, for those paying attention
[01:08:18] *** acdw- is now known as acdw
[02:19:08] <lagash> acdw: it doesn't have anything to do with SSL does it?
[02:20:23] <acdw> it might honestly. but the other server uses ssl as well
[02:20:37] <acdw> well everything connects, it's just very very slow to get connected.
[02:20:45] <wasamasa> network issue probably
[02:20:47] <acdw> makes me wonder if my internet is not good
[02:21:16] <acdw> oh hi wasamasa, lol yeah that's what i was thinking now
