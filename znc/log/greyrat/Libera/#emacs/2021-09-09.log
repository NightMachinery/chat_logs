[00:07:43] <alphapapa[m]> Are you kidding?  EWOC is fantastic.
[00:07:59] <alphapapa[m]> It makes UI stuff trivial that is otherwise very awkward in Emacs.

[00:08:38] <alphapapa[m]> Do you mean to say, if it's so great, why isn't it used more widely?
[00:09:08] <wasamasa> no, I suspect it has the same fate as several other built-in libraries
[00:09:13] <wasamasa> sounds great on paper, used by nobody
[00:09:30] <wasamasa> in the case of semantic it's because of the overall complexity
[00:09:49] <alphapapa[m]> If so, the answer is probably that few know it exists, and it's not very discoverable.  I used Emacs and wrote Emacs packages for years before I recently discovered it.  It has a separate manual, so it's not easily found from Elisp docs.  So you almost have to know it exists to know it exists.
[00:10:02] <rpav> yeah i never heard of it and i was looking for similar things at some point
[00:10:07] <wasamasa> so far my theory holds
[00:10:08] <alphapapa[m]> It's not complex at all; in fact, it's very simple.  It's nothing like widget.el.

[00:11:10] <rpav> alphapapa[m]: i want to actually write a "data editor" that does something sortof like what this sounds like, except without the "text buffer" in the middle
[00:11:16] <alphapapa[m]> I don't know what your theory is, but EWOC is great.  I use it in Ement.el, and it is so much simpler than the old way I did things in matrix-client.el, munging text properties and buffer positions manually.
[00:11:26] <rpav> but i'm wondering if i can use this as a first-hack to bootstrap
[00:11:43] <alphapapa[m]> functions like ewoc-enter-after, ewoc-invalidate, ewoc-collect... it's all very functional and simple to use
[00:12:16] <alphapapa[m]> rpav: Not sure /exactly/ what you mean by data editor, but if it's what I think you mean, I saw someone post something like that on Reddit recently

[04:34:17] <dre> as a vim user i used vim+tmux a lot, I'm sorta wondering how well emacs-gtk can do for things like py.test and general shellish things.
[04:34:29] <grym> dre: with vterm, just fine 
[04:34:38] <technomancy> why not just M-x compile?

[04:34:46] <fsbot> compile is [0] M-x compile

[04:35:02] <technomancy> with M-x compile you can get hyperlinks in your stack traces

[07:00:44] <johnjay> i'm testing in a virtual machine

[07:05:36] <wgreenhouse> johnjay: emacs generally does a good job of documenting what those are and what they're for, and ./configure output is informative
[07:06:04] <johnjay> yes i can configure debug emacs really easily
[07:06:15] <johnjay> configure says it needs x. so i install x. then it says it needs y. so i install y

[07:24:29] <johnjay> T_T
[07:24:52] <dale> Possibly, yes.
[07:24:54] <wgreenhouse> it means many of the deps will be literally different packages

[07:27:22] <wgreenhouse> debian generally doesn't go out of its way to annoy you in this regard, but it does split libraries from header files

[10:04:29] <parsnip> here comes a parsnip
[10:04:56] <parsnip> i keep wondering if i should try BLoC
[10:05:12] <parsnip> which is where you put all your app's state in a big ball of state
[10:05:21] <parsnip> and the ball just has sinks and sources
[10:05:38] <parsnip> streams, really
[10:05:44] <parsnip> and the app can listen to the sources
[10:06:00] <parsnip> and user clicks are sent in the sinks
[10:06:22] <parsnip> but i wonder if this layer of indirection is good, easy, etc
[10:06:35] <parsnip> i think streams are hard to work with initially
[10:06:37] <contrapunctus> parsnip: "BLoC"?
[10:06:50] <parsnip> business logic of code or something
[10:07:03] <contrapunctus> parsnip: sounds like CLIM

[10:08:15] <parsnip> i think BLoC came about when dart was straddling  angulardart and flutter, and people were considering how to share a dart codebase between the two GUI frameworks

[10:11:07] <bpalmer> I do not feel confident about my knowledge of the BLoC pattern; but I would say it's not about putting all the state in a big ball of state, but rather keeping state separate from the GUI presenting it (very much a model-view or model-view-controller approach, but built around streams)
[10:11:36] <bpalmer> You can have many different BLoC components that your app listens in on.
[10:11:41] <parsnip> yeah my state is relatively tangled with UI and flutter
[10:15:06] <parsnip> probably what i should really do, is start a prototype project where i can see which strategies help me grow a project with state and UI both being well tested
[10:16:10] <bpalmer> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54942977/mvvm-vs-bloc-patterns : "The NEW THING in BloC was that it should not expose any methods. Instead, it would only accept events through its exposed sink or sinks. This was for sake of code reuse between Angular Dart web apps and Flutter mobile apps"
[10:16:23] <bpalmer> so that agrees with you it was designed for angular dart and flutter.
[10:16:41] <parsnip> yeah so it's a particular solution almost
[10:17:04] *** Quits: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:17:50] <parsnip> at least most of my state is lifted near the top of the widget tree, but it involves nested widgets, which means it's fairly wrapped up in use of the flutter sdk, e.g.
[10:18:16] *** Quits: bitmega (~bitmega@user/bitmega) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2.1)
[10:18:31] <parsnip> and this BLoC thing is almost the intuitive solution
[10:18:44] <parsnip> flutter GUI involves lots of signals up and down
[10:19:05] <parsnip> so if you want to remove the GUI from that state, it looks like a ball with sinks and sources
[10:19:19] <parsnip> that's the minimal Dart representation, i guess
[10:19:42] <parsnip> but then that's to imply i can write unit tests that simulate the UI? eek
[10:20:04] <parsnip> or back the other way, simulate the ball to write widget tests?
[10:20:13] <twb> So they hacked a workaround for imposed limitations, then decided to call that a deliberate design?
[10:21:34] <parsnip> which limitation?
[10:21:54] <parsnip> oh, imposed

[13:48:05] <erk-> Hi I have come to ask about the `parse-time-string` which seems to give some really strange results. For example `(format-time-string "%H:%M:%S.%N" (parse-time-string "2021-09-09T08:55:59.828000+00:00"))` evaluates to "19:04:39.000008000", does anyone know what I am doing wrong here?

[14:21:19] <zeraphel> erk-: format-time-string uses strftime (so it expects epochseconds?),  parse-time-string returns a list of (sec min hour day ... ) so more akin to juliantime. the summery im reading is- `(info "(elisp) time parsing")`

[16:50:16] <pjb> euouae: not much.  emacs lisp files are installed normally in places like /usr/local/share/emacs/$version/lisp in compiled (elc) and source compressed  (.el.gz) forms.
[16:50:53] <pjb> euouae: so: make install # should indeed update them, and if you don't do a make clean, it wouldn't recompile the C code.
[16:51:06] <euouae> pjb I have some unix ignorance here on the file hierarchy, but what if I do a local install?
[16:51:47] <bpalmer> a local install to some place besides /usr/local ?
[16:51:58] <pjb> euouae: if you don't specify a prefix, it will do a local instal by default IIRC (ie /usr/local).  ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/it
[16:52:09] <pjb> then make install will install it where you've configured it.
[16:52:12] <euouae> bpalmer this is unix ignorance, but isn't /usr/local writable by root only?
[16:52:19] <pjb> euouae: not necessarily.
[16:52:47] <pjb> euouae: on my system I can write on /usr/local and I place there stuff that can be used by everybody. But on other systems it's root writable only.

[16:53:30] <bpalmer> euouae: you can also just run the emacs binary out of the source tree.
[16:53:34] <pjb> euouae: I use ~/opt to install apps.

[17:03:45] <euouae> wasamasa, one more thing. I'm not 100% convinced it needs to be done from gnutls. I don't understand why the weechat approach can't be taken
[17:03:45] <wasamasa> elaborate
[17:03:45] <euouae> wasamasa, weechat offers the user a configuration option to 'retrieve a pass/key from the invocation of a program'
[17:03:45] <wasamasa> or do M-x find-function RET gnutls-boot RET
[17:03:45] <wasamasa> what is the name of that option?
[17:03:45] <euouae> give me a sec
[17:03:45] <wasamasa> and most importantly, does it handle certificates?
[17:03:50] <wasamasa> if not, then your argument is moot
[17:04:23] <euouae> Just be easy on me I'm not very knowledgeable
[17:04:39] <wasamasa> well, if you cannot handle me, then you cannot handle eliz
[17:04:40] <euouae> What I understand is that we have a file (pass/key/cert/etc) that we don't want to keep around unencrypted. Right?
[17:04:47] <wasamasa> certificate, yes
[17:04:56] <wasamasa> the API talks in terms of files only
[17:05:17] <euouae> okay. Can we use pipes/sockets?
[17:05:40] <euouae> I guess that might not be available for all operating systems. Is that the issue?

[17:07:14] <wasamasa> I'm speaking of the gnutls API
[17:07:25] <euouae> Why not just set up IPC between emacs and the program that decrypts?
[17:07:42] <wasamasa> emacs uses the gnutls library to do TLS

[19:56:53] <parsnip> codingquark: in the tab titles? or in the task item, below the text?
[19:57:15] <codingquark> parsnip: task items
[19:57:37] <parsnip> the second line of each item, the design is a shitty copy of TaskwarriorC2 design
[19:57:54] <parsnip> it corresponds though, with those sort chips, id, entry, etc
[19:58:36] <parsnip> so like for the first item, id: 3, entry: 7d, due: -7d, tags: [+a], urgency: 12.8
[19:58:48] <parsnip> so like, it was added 7 days ago, and due 7 days ago
[19:59:11] <parsnip> id means it's the 3rd line item in the pending.data file
[19:59:23] <acdw> dammnnn google docs is killing me
[19:59:49] <acdw> i wanted to grab the document title with elisp, but of course drive doesn't /load/ the page title until later, with javascript ;-;
[19:59:53] <parsnip> so sorting by id loosely correlates with sorting by entry date
[20:00:17] <parsnip> but they can be out of order because a task can come from another client, for example
[20:00:35] <parsnip> so an older entry date can arrive as a later line item
[20:01:00] <codingquark> I personally find the second line of items to be a bit "cryptic" for the lack of a better word

[20:02:53] <parsnip> like, that restricts the sort columns too, limiting the sort columns to what seems readable in that cryptic line

[20:11:57] <parsnip> like, something occurs to me, jump to terminal, add it, and go back to what i was doing
[20:12:05] <parsnip> but it extends to mobile too
[20:12:54] <codingquark> I don't generally capture tasks from mobile because it is not as frictionless as org-capture is in orgzly
[20:13:31] <parsnip> you mean orgzly is not as frictionless about capturing tasks?
[20:13:53] <parsnip> i had trouble parsing
[20:14:21] <codingquark> Yes. I want my tasks to go under the heading "Inbox", want it to automatically set the date of capture, save and sync.

[21:06:28] <parsnip> i think there's two issues with org-mode for me

[21:07:16] <parsnip> maybe three or more issues
[21:07:19] <parsnip> org-mode invites me to make a mess
[21:07:35] <bpalmer> apteryx: when you say add like that, it makes me think you may be nesting the list too deeply
[21:07:36] <parsnip> i was never great at leveraging org-mode to generate these agendas from a todo list
[21:08:05] <bpalmer> the mail-sources variable should be a list; each elemen to fthat list should be something like '(directory :path "/whatever" :suffix "the-thing")
[21:08:22] <parsnip> whereas taskwarrior does a better job for me, of being a place to add a task quickly, and list things, and reorder them using various fields
[21:08:39] <parsnip> org-mode is just where i write notes, or make more complicated plans/tasks
[21:08:39] <bpalmer> apteryx: that means if you're using add-to-list or (setq mail-sources (cons x mail-sources)) , you should only be '(directory ...) , not '((directory...))
[21:09:10] <bpalmer> apteryx: hope that is helpful. good luck.
[21:09:22] <apteryx> bpalmer: it's being added as (setq mail-sources '((directory ...)); i.e. there's only one item in the mail-sources list
[21:09:32] <codingquark> parsnip: and I guess it is easy enough to quickly launch shell commands from emacs minibuffer, so org-capture is not missed much

[22:43:06] <TRS-80> OK, thanks.  :)
[22:43:07] <e1f> erc is the emacs of irc clients
[22:43:30] <TRS-80> Well, I would venture a guess that any Emacs IRC client is like that, to one extent or another?
[22:43:36] <e1f> erc takes about 10 years to configure
[22:43:49] <TRS-80> Or maybe you meant to say the Gnus of IRC clients (don't want to put words in your mouth, lol)?
[22:45:19] <TRS-80> I think I am in a position now to say though, it doesn't need to take years to configure Gnus.  You can get the 5% you need to know in just a few minutes.  Then spend 10 years on the other 95% of filing down the "rough" edges...
