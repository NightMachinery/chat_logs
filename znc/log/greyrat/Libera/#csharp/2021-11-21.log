[03:24:46] <bomb> joe64686 you have my full support.
[03:26:05] <Suchiman> bomb: then answer the question :P

[03:28:13] <MaNa2k> maybe his talking about music notes
[03:30:05] <MaNa2k> which makes we wonder, why are these langages called  someting with c anyhow?   c, objective-c, c++, c#
[03:30:09] <joe64686> well c# is a turing machine so at it's core it has to have basic ability to read write and move
[03:30:50] <joe64686> in a way i am trying to understand how c# was made Xd
[03:32:02] <MaNa2k> it was probably made as a competitor to java, even the syntax looks very similar, but uses less resources and is faster
[03:32:29] <MaNa2k> we learned java in first univeristy, second year c#. the transition was really simple
[03:32:42] <MaNa2k> in first year*
[03:33:34] <joe64686> ok and if you were to make a c# from scratch what would you do?
[03:34:03] <joe64686> compiled or interpreted? or maybe parsed?
[03:34:36] <irwiss> any actually useful programming language is an abstraction over turing machines about as high as stratosphere is for ants
[03:35:12] <Suchiman> joe64686: well C# is parsed by roslyn and compiled into IL bytecode stored in dll or exe assemblies which are then read by the runtime and compiled on the fly via a JIT to machine instructions
[03:35:50] <MaNa2k> ...with auto GC

[23:52:45] <Guest53> is it possible using efcore, to loop over list of table names strings and query them? i have a list of table names, all belong to the same db context. now i want to loop over them and perform a query from each table?
[23:53:25] <Guest53> Context.<table name string>.Where(...)

[23:55:55] <Suchiman> Guest53: what type would .Where(x => x....) x have?
[23:57:07] <Guest53> ah, each table would have different type. i know the types (i used ClrType.GetInterfaces() for that)
[23:57:52] <Suchiman> Guest53: the closest you can get is QueryThings<T>() where T : IMyInterface { context.Set<T>().Where(x => x.InterfaceMember == 42); }
[23:58:07] <Suchiman> Guest53: but then you need QueryThings<A>(); QueryThings<B>(); QueryThings<C>();
