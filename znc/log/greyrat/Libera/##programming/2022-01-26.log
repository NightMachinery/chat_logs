[00:22:11] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, could you tell me if this statemnt is true or not"
[00:22:13] <[itchyjunk]> <hodapp> there are programming languages that do not suffer from the halting problem either, and it turns out that even if you disallow unbounded recursion (for instance) you can still allow all kinds of other recursion that may end up being as much as you need
[00:22:23] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: infact it's worse, in languages like Agda sometimes you don't even know if typechecking will halt

[01:33:43] <KillerWasp> So far I have seen only in theory, but is there any practical application for quadratics?
[01:34:00] <ski> homomorphism, and isomorphism, crop up all the time, in algebra, and also outside of algebra (analysis, metric spaces, topology). also in graph theory (isomorphic graphs, which is an NP problem, iirc)

[13:32:26] <pikapika> mishugana, its basically magical when you can keep steadily chipping away with math tricks etc until you have a very tight fixed size buffer for what initially appeared to require some non-trivial growing array usage

[13:35:18] <pikapika> I don't know what they use these days inside gcc, but our textbook mainly used a data flow tree technique
[13:35:24] <pikapika> We never had the world lambda there

[13:47:29] <pikapika> DPA, there is no such thing as an unmapped address
[13:47:45] <pikapika> Your real byte index is just your segmented index modulo the total real bytes
[13:47:49] <vdamewood> pikapika: But that's not how the x86 did it. The 8086 had 1 megabyte of address space, and the lower 12 bits of the segment overlapped with the upper 12 bits of the address register.
[13:47:50] <GeDaMo> It's possible for there to be no memory at an address though
[13:47:54] <merijn> Hell, C doesn't even guarantee such a thing as bytes... (well, it does, in the sense that C defined "byte" to mean "char")
[13:48:14] <pikapika> merijn, it may not be in theory, but any tim you are dealing with such a hardware/compiler combination you are already dealing with a special langauge and a special problem
[13:48:35] <pikapika> vdamewood, what I clearly remember was that
[13:48:41] <pikapika> I could dump any random part of the memory
[13:48:50] <merijn> pikapika: At this point you're actively advocating *against* C and *for* "I'm writing GCC x.y on CPU z"
[13:48:50] <pikapika> and it could just as stated repeatedly wrap around
[13:49:18] <merijn> You are no longer programming C. You're programming some kinda "C-inspired dialect and can't reliably port your code to any other platform"
[13:49:29] <pikapika> merijn, I am saying if you are writing an arena allocator and your hardware/compiler system is so exotic that your addresses aren't linear you are alreadying working on a specialized application
[13:49:34] <pikapika> Its not a "C" appliaction
[13:49:44] <pikapika> Its a "exotic microcontroller" or whatever application
[13:49:47] <mishugana> that's a valid point, I think
[13:50:06] <pikapika> You don't write C or python when developing arduino, you write arduino when developing arduino
[13:50:40] <DPA> unmapped address do exist on modern x86 CPUs. They have virual memory / memory mapping stuff.

[16:06:16] <Amadiro> DarkTrick, typically you're not using REST to query files (though you can, too) but more to interact with a program on the other end
[16:06:19] <Stefan26> I'm not sure what the simpler word than ortogonal that carried same meaning would be?
[16:06:24] <kinduff> is there a tool like Hubot that allows creating a bot with multiple adapters? but like for 2022
[16:06:44] <Amadiro> DarkTrick, you might be using a REST API to make the remote program give you a slice from its database, or to make it perform a certain action
[16:07:02] <DarkTrick> Stefan26, "independent of each other"?
[16:07:38] <kinduff> like Microsoft/botframework but without the Microsoft part
[16:10:05] <DarkTrick> Amadiro, 👍️  so a REST api is no magic, but just a regular API as everybody knows, with the exception, that it follows the six(?) RESTful principles
[16:10:14] <DarkTrick> ^ Is my understanding
[16:10:19] <Stefan26> yeah perhaps independent? i mean "REST" and "JSON" are loosely associated concepts... "some-data-exchange-standard" and "some-data-transfer-format" but you can change one of those without affecting the other?
[16:10:41] <Stefan26> (im not trying to be clever... just trying to work out exactly when ortogonal is a good word)
[16:11:13] <Amadiro> DarkTrick, nobody really follows any principles, but yeah
[16:12:14] <Amadiro> DarkTrick, the main reason REST (and its predecessors) got popular is because 1) you could make those requests from the browser, and that was suddenly a big deal, 2) every firewall, proxy, reverse proxy and other network device allows and can handle HTTP adequately, so it works pretty well, and 3) it's easy to just use the same thing for everything
[16:13:57] <vdamewood> Stefan26: Ilike to picture two rods, one vertical and one horizontal. They aren't touching. They are orthogonal. (The mathematical meaning of the word). That helps me figure out when to use it.
[16:17:53] <DarkTrick> vdamewood, Stefan26: Same here: x/y axis. No matter how much you dance on one axis, you will never do anything to the other one.

[16:37:14] <merijn> I'm confused why the vim user would only be pressing 'w' >.>
[16:37:24] <Stefan26> so simplified i guess if you add a clustered index on timestamp column... data-rows close to each other w.r.t timestamp-column value may  be close to each other on the disk? Wheras non-clustered indices doesn't change how the data is stored... it's just a helping structure that's added on the side that the database-engine uses to locate rows
[16:37:31] <Amadiro> yep, there are some implementation specific details of how clustered indices are implemented, but it's basically the layout of the data itself
[16:41:35] <rsonx> According to what I understood, the records in the datafile must be sorted in the same order in which the indices in the index file is sorted. By doing so we create small clusters of data records that corresponds to an index. What will happen if we move an entire cluster relative to other clusters. that cluster must still correspond to same index. But can we still call the indices clustered?

[23:38:56] <bnchs__> png and jpg are binary formats
[23:39:21] <tomathy> my png images contain strange text
[23:39:23] <gamara> Hey so I am using an event service that requires the use of a JWT token that contains a subscription that tells the client (in the browser) what events to listen for, it is stored as a cookie. Is it bad practice to constantly change the JWT when the user enters different pages so they can subscribe to diffferent events?
[23:39:27] <deniska> I was responding to the use of the term "completely open"
[23:41:48] <lf94> bnchs__: because many communities are there
[23:42:00] <lf94> bnchs__: but it's just another testament to irc being the ultimate
