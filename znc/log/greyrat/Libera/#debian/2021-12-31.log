[04:32:02] <Wally> Why would I see "chroot: failed to run command â€˜/bin/bashâ€™: Exec format error" after restarting debian. The armhf jail worked fine before restart :|

[04:32:28] <Blondie101010> likely a missing dependency
[04:32:52] <Blondie101010> ldd yourbash and make sure you copy those in the chroot
[04:34:08] <Blondie101010> don't know that jail package, but my own used a service, so theirs could also expect you to have a service running
[04:34:30] <Wally> It's using qemu-user-static /debootstrap
[04:35:15] <Blondie101010> don't know what you're talking about, though my initial answer still applies

[04:35:38] <Wally> If I run ldd rootfs/bin/bash I get "not a dynamic executable" :)
[04:35:49] <Blondie101010> if that package is supposed to copy dependencies for you, check their documentation...  if it doesn't, then copy them over
[04:36:02] <Blondie101010> hmmm
[04:36:48] <Blondie101010> can you run that rootfs/bin/bash outside the chroot?
[04:37:01] <Wally> no because it's a different architecture. (AMD64 vs armhf)
[04:37:16] <Blondie101010> well that could also explain why ldd can't read it
[04:37:31] <Wally> yeah, it worked prior to a reboot so..
[04:37:45] <Wally> I've had this issue in the past too
[04:37:59] <Blondie101010> so like I said, likely a service you did not restart
[04:38:10] <Blondie101010> so look at their installation steps or documentation

[15:49:39] <Misotauros> Khepra, indeed. I was going to write about it - I managed to install those packages. Its no fun. You need to leave your email.
[15:50:02] <Misotauros> and its installed in /opt
[15:52:37] <labrador> you need to leave your email?
[15:52:39] <labrador> wtf
[15:53:11] <Misotauros> yeah - otherwise you cant access the deb files
[15:54:14] <Misotauros> still happy because I have gentoo system which updated to 11.0.5 and had the StorageDirector with 9.x on a Debian machine and they wont work together. Backup is up gain.
[15:54:22] <Khepra> you can always download the source and built it yourself, no email needed
[15:55:05] <labrador> still that sounds sus
[15:55:22] <Misotauros> Aha. I did that. Even copied the debian control files to 11.0.5. debuild however will fail (after a looong time of compilation)
[15:56:00] <Misotauros> and the one prog I wanted is bacula-sd, which depends on some bacula libs. I did not want to start copying wildly files into the system.

[19:05:28] <knob> hey, so .... is bullseye ... long term support?
[19:05:39] <Khepra> knob: btw, mediawiki is packaged in debian, and taht would -- I assume -- pull in a httpd and in turn install all the prerequisites, uids and gids included
[19:06:01] <Khepra> knob: all debians, after a year-ish of being old-stable, become LTS, and then ELTS. "all" since ... wheezy methinks?
[19:06:13] <Khepra> there's no separate LTS releases like with ubuntu

[20:28:29] <tete_> can i do something like wpa_passphrase networkname 'myPassword!' > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf ?

[20:29:28] <ln> sounds like you are not too familiar with the command line yet eager to use it
[20:31:04] <tete_> ln, r u kidding me? i work since 25 years with linux
[20:31:05] <cerl> Hey tete_ https://paste.debian.net/plainh/798dcbeb Here's an example wpa_supplicant.conf of what I do.
[20:31:17] <jmcnaught> tete_: The Debian wiki also has information on configuring wifi from the command line: https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#Manual also note that you can use NetworkManager without a GUI too, via nmcli and nmtui

[20:32:03] <cerl> Use quotation marks over single ticks tete_
[20:32:38] <ln> cerl: i see no difference between those in this context
[20:32:52] <tete_> and if i have ' in the password, how is this handled then
[20:32:57] <cerl> Well I just prefer "" over ''.
[20:32:57] <tete_> do i have to escape that ?
[20:33:31] <tete_> so i guess the password 'helloWorld' would be then \'helloWorld\' ?
[20:33:37] <ln> tete_: the '' are handled by the shell and not passed as part of the argument to the program
[20:34:16] <ln> if you *do* want the single quotes to be part of the password, then i guess you'd escape them as \'

[20:34:55] <tete_> thanks anyway, i'll try it with ' '
[20:35:14] <ln> tete_: the guessing was about what you would do, not what i would do.
[20:35:28] <Khepra> I don't think you can echo just taht one line; don't you need the whole network={} stanza?
[20:35:41] <cerl> I find using the command line wpa_supplicant to be a major PITA. It's why I prefer networkmanager applet.
[20:36:09] <cerl> It's one of the few times I prefer a GUI over command line.

[20:37:50] <cerl> Even the slackware docs says that using config files is just too much work (especially if you travel a lot) for the wifi and that using a program like networkmanager is just better.
[20:38:30] <tete_> sounds reasonable, i use the wifi only because i am too lazy to connect a rj45 cable from the pi to my router :P its too far and through my whole living room
[20:38:35] <Khepra> that's nonsense. wpa_supplicant.conf is dead easy to set up, you can even have multiple networks and roam between them

[20:45:02] <cerl> Let me rephrase it, it might not be hard to use, but it's a pain to deal with because something always goes wrong for me.
[20:45:04] <Khepra> tete_: something like this:  https://bpa.st/6C4A
[20:45:31] <tete_> Khepra, oh thanks, thats perfect :)
[20:46:03] <Khepra> and it's automagic via default ifupdown. it even works when you hotplug wifi (which requires allow-hotplug entry).   just make sure you use proper wlan iface name. I remove "predictable" udev crapping, so I ahve ethX and wlanX and friends.
[20:47:35] <Khepra> you can have multiple network{} stanzas, and priorities among them for perfect roaming. THIS beats any stupid networkmanager that's often buggy, forgets networks and craps itself for no visible reason. this AlwaysWorks(tm).
[20:47:58] <tete_> hi

[20:49:37] <Khepra> a matter of preference I suppose, jokes aside. important point here is that if cli/wpa_supplicant is preferred, it's dead easy even in multi-network roaming environments.

[22:55:17] <tete_> have another wierd problem i dont understand, maybe someone here has an idea whats going on. i have a edgerouter poe from ubiquiti and i made a factory reset. the first port (eth0) should have 192.168.1.1, so i set on my rasbpi 192.168.1.10, but i can not ping it. the wifi is down because the wifi is connected to another router which also has 192.168.1.1. i already rebooted a couple of times, but still no progress with ping. i get PING
[22:55:17] <tete_> 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) from 169.254.50.35 eth0: 56(84) bytes of data.
[22:55:44] <tete_> wondering what that 169.254... comes from. seems like some kind of dummy ip.

[22:57:00] <cdhowie> 169.254 is the APIPA range
[22:57:14] <sussudio> it's what you get when it can't get an ip.
[22:57:23] <cdhowie> It's the "you have DHCP turned on but no server replied" range
[22:57:44] <sussudio> are you sure you plugged the cablemodem ethernet into the right port on the router
[22:57:54] <tete_> there is no cablemodem involved
[22:57:57] <cdhowie> Sometimes they can be useful, for example on closed audio networks
[22:58:00] <tete_> its a router and a rasbpi
[22:58:09] <cdhowie> Otherwise they indicate a problem
[22:58:34] <tete_> the rasbpi is connected to the edgerouter by lan, and when i need it i turn on the wifi on the rpbi to access my home wifi router which provides access to the internet
[22:59:14] <sussudio> could be it needs 20-30 minutes after a hard reset
[22:59:22] <tete_> 20-30 minutes? for what?
[22:59:43] <tete_> when 169.254 is some dhcp-failed-ip, i guess it somehow tried to get an ip from the edgerouter
