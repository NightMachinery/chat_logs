[00:21:29] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[00:27:36] <JimBuntu> wb Joanna , I'm out of here for a while though... be well.
[00:29:28] <jan6> ohai dere
[00:32:03] <Joanna> Did I miss anything?
[00:50:46] <jan6> from my end, doesn't look like it, other than a bunch of joins and leaves there's been nothing spoken
[00:52:18] * jan6 idly wonders if anyone knows anyone with experience with C.H.I.P. computers...prolly not...
[00:52:31] * jan6 also idly wonders what'd be the cheapest way to backup stuff
[00:52:42] * jan6 idly wonders a lot of stuff, lol
[01:37:08] <Joanna> Maybe we need members so there can be more talking..
[01:42:15] <jan6> given it's an "on-topic" channel, it doesn't invite chatter, in general, y'know ;P
[01:45:57] <Joanna> Opsec and physical security are interesting topics
[01:48:27] <opsec> nice to meet you, i'm the one in the shadows watching you at all times.
[01:49:54] <Joanna> Haha
[01:51:18] <Joanna> I could add personal security to the topic but that’s kind of covered under physical security
[01:51:49] <opsec> i could have died 10 ways today
[01:52:54] <opsec> rode my KLR from Quetzaltenago to Panajachel through the Guatemalan mountains in crazy fog, dogs all over, huge cracks and abrupt openings in the highway.. people just stopping in the middloe of the highway... 
[01:52:59] <opsec> good times.
[01:59:11] <Joanna> What do you do if your bike needs repairs down there ?
[01:59:40] <opsec> repair it
[02:00:32] <jan6> cool
[02:00:51] <opsec> boiught an oil filter today on the way back
[02:01:11] <jan6> what oil do you have to filter, lol
[02:01:15] <opsec> i change the oil every 3000 miles
[02:01:35] <opsec> motor oil
[02:01:39] <jan6> ah
[02:01:42] <opsec> 20W50 
[02:03:15] <Joanna> Isn’t it difficult to get parts ?
[02:03:38] <opsec> some maybe, i'll have them shipped from the USA or elsewhere
[02:03:54] <opsec> everything is solutionable if you want...
[02:04:50] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[02:05:37] <jan6> globalization's great benefit is that TECHNICALLY you can get anything from any corner of the world shipped to you ;P
[02:06:08] <jan6> also woo, jess's here, someone who knows their stuff, unlike me
[02:06:10] <opsec> until you can't
[02:06:19] <jess> i dont know anything
[02:06:42] <opsec> and we're all required to stay inside without a permit to leave decribing exactly where we're allowed to go
[02:07:57] <jan6> if you didn't know anything you wouldn't be able to speak on IRC, because you wouldn't know how to connect ;P
[02:08:12] <opsec> when enough have voluntarily killed themselves off, the rest will be used as maintanence workers and intermediary overseers
[02:09:01] <jess> jan6: im just a cat that walked over a keyboard
[02:09:03] <opsec> the owners will have nothing directly to do with the slaves, except maybe fun lethal "sporting events"
[02:09:07] <jess> infinite monkeys infinite typewriters
[02:09:37] <jan6> you're just a cat who by pure chance happens to sound like they know what they're doing, while actually having no clue, got it
[02:12:05] <Joanna> opsec: you are free to ride around on your bike though ?
[02:13:31] <jan6> classic non-good-advice: "it's not illegal if you don't get caught"
[02:16:31] <opsec> Joanna: it's legally registered in the USA and Guatemala
[02:17:07] <opsec> i have to pay a $400 deposit to ride around or through Mexico for a year
[02:17:29] <opsec> deposit is returned in full on successful exit of the vehicle
[02:17:37] <opsec> if not, bye bye deposit
[02:17:45] * jan6 is the prince of chaos, and the duke of terrible advice, btw
[02:22:09] <Joanna>  The deposit is like a surety bond?

[02:43:56] <opsec> if you die though, they will give the money to anyone you name in the document

[02:47:25] <Joanna> Oh you can’t buy directly from people?
[03:16:46] <xau> opsec have you read Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig?
[03:19:06] <xau> the reason I ask is because your operational vibe is congruent with the vibe Pirsig conveys in his book.
[03:19:23] <xau> If you haven't yet read it, you might enjoy it / profit from it.
[03:19:42] <operational> hi
[03:20:02] <xau> hi operational
[03:20:31] <xau> I'm tensioning spokes on an e-bike at the moment.
[03:21:01] <xau> bike shops extort brutally from needy e-bikers, so independent maintenance capability is a must.
