[08:55:43] <gtlsgamr> no.
[08:56:03] <Abhi[m]> Iit bad guys
[08:56:09] <gtlsgamr> But lets not talk about that. What I wanted to ask was, what are some good things in iOS that I should know about? Abhi[m] 
[08:56:52] <gtlsgamr> Nothing is inherently "good" or "bad". IIT can be bad for you for some reason, but for a guy that could get his family out of poverty by studying at an IIT, IIT is good.
[08:57:25] <NeoVoid[m]> https://codered.eccouncil.org
[08:57:50] <labrador> gtlsgamr, I could give you a lot of bad reasons....but no good ones
[08:57:51] <NeoVoid[m]> the best IIT is self IIT
[08:57:52] <labrador> lol
[08:58:27] <NeoVoid[m]> NeoVoid[m]: professional courses from ec council like professional educators for free
[08:58:36] <gtlsgamr> labrador: that doesn't mean there are no good reasons
[08:58:57] <labrador> gtlsgamr, ok so 1 could be that by default its more private than android...just barely
[08:59:02] <telegram_1385150> Apparently yes
[08:59:17] <gtlsgamr> labrador: definitely yes.
[08:59:31] <gtlsgamr> I was a hardcore android fanboy since I understood what a phone was
[08:59:36] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: whom your are talking with i cant see labradors msg here
[08:59:40] <gtlsgamr> this is the first time I have stepped into the apple ecosystem
[08:59:47] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], cuz you've ignored me....
[08:59:49] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]: that means labrador is banned in matrix
[08:59:57] <labrador> oh ok

[09:03:38] <gtlsgamr> nice
[09:03:47] <labrador> ok will do
[09:04:20] <NeoVoid[m]> I wont judge him for his decision.
[09:06:05] <labrador> gtlsgamr, any particular reason for going to apple's ecosystem?
[09:06:47] <gtlsgamr> labrador: I got the phone as a gift. They asked me what phone I wanted... I wanted an iphone because all the current android phones suck ass
[09:07:15] <labrador> oh noice gtlsgamr
[09:07:29] <gtlsgamr> My main reason for using an android was piracy and shit.. but I am getting tech-free these days so a basic phone with a good camera is more important to me than having a phone which can have cracked apps
[09:08:10] <labrador> gtlsgamr, do you want my opinion on the best phone?
[09:08:19] <gtlsgamr> i click photos with my wife at weddings, i put them as status on whatsapp sometimes. i talk with family on whatsapp. i take notes on joplin, i check emails. no social media. I watch mahabharat sometimes on my computer.
[09:08:25] <gtlsgamr> labrador: sure
[09:08:35] <gtlsgamr> no netflix, no prime video
[09:08:42] <gtlsgamr> just good old using the phone as a phone
[09:09:27] <labrador> gtlsgamr, I would like a pixel 5 running rooted lineageOS with a few tweaks like using eOS's captive portal. Best mixture of freedom,privacy and security for me imo
[09:09:51] <labrador> Also yeah that would work well gtlsgamr 
[09:12:29] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: this is so different from my views for iphone v android, yet i can only feel respect for your use case. coz you know why you are using iphone and what purpose it serves you that android does not. you aren't doing it for 'apple-bling-fame', this is genuine.
[09:15:50] <gtlsgamr> iphone is a "just works" phone. it is a phone that you could give to a kid. I get updates for 5 years minimum
[09:16:05] <gtlsgamr> that is the only reason I use it. it is better for my use case
[09:17:02] <labrador> gtlsgamr, though I usually like my OS to "expose(heh)" itself to me. Thats the only way to learn more and move ahead
[09:18:14] <relejek[m]> unbanned labrador  in matrix. this is their 1st chance to be an upstanding group member. be nice everyone.
[09:18:51] <labrador> thanks relejek[m] 
[09:22:45] <sla[m]12> <gtlsgamr> "My main reason for using an..." <- cope
[09:23:01] <sla[m]12> iphones are made for peaking consooooom
[09:23:38] <sla[m]12> if you are trying tech-free, buy a android phone and flash linage or calyx without gapps
[09:23:46] <sla[m]12> longer batterylife and less tracking
[09:24:43] <sla[m]12> less distractions
[09:31:26] <gtlsgamr> sla[m]12: try getting off 4chan :). flashing lineage, and maintaining it will only bring me closer to tech. I have been through that phase as well. consoooom is a meme from /g/ that only works on that board. irl if you wanna be tech free, you can be so with an iphone too
[09:32:04] <gtlsgamr> I have a life now. SO I only use computers during job hours, rest I spend with my family or doing stuff for the house.

[20:17:44] <sla[m]12> <gtlsgamr> "sla: try getting off 4chan..." <- consooom is a meme cause people like you made it to be :)  and you don't have to constantly maintain a custom rom /system is read only, you are not gonna break much. once you flash the rom you dont have to do anything updates are ota for official releases like any other stock rom
[20:18:41] <gtlsgamr> what do you mean "people like you". what kind of a person am i?
[20:18:53] <sla[m]12> <gtlsgamr> "I have a life now. SO I only use..." <- well i am better than you in that case, i don't have a smartphone for more than a year, only my pc
[20:19:02] <sla[m]12> gtlsgamr: well you know the meme
