[02:40:09] <jan6> "What's in My "Day in the City" Backpack?" by deviantollam
[02:43:22] <jan6> it's a pretty nice overview of generic stuff for any kind of travel, such as a sternum strap to add onto a cheap backpack, making it harder to steal (especially when e.g. sitting down, just clasp it to a chair or something and if someone tries to swipe it they'll be dragging a chair along, which will hinder them and let you catch up) and distribute weight better, basic clothes and a charger and
[02:43:23] <jan6> stuff like that

[14:07:33] <Joanna> jan6: lts I’ve seen various things for people going to countries with thieves such as metal nets to put inside your backpack and things with metal cables inside the straps. Although my backpack has sternum strap I wouldn’t leave it unattended like that. I question the judgment of people who voluntarily go to places where theft is rampant.  At what point are people willing to escalate from slashing your backpack and running off 
[14:07:33] <Joanna> with your stuff to slashing your throat and running off with your stuff? I don’t want to find out.

[17:56:30] <jan6> Joanna: the main tipping point is "does the person look worth the trouble, and is in an area I won't get caught in", and deviant's tactic explicitly addresses it by using some random cheap-ass bag that doesn't look like you'd have anything worth stealing or robbing in the first place, which is always a good strategy
