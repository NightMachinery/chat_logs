[04:32:16] <BrokenClutch> Made a test game
[04:32:26] <BrokenClutch> Haskell started to be intuitive
[04:33:59] <f-a> very good
[04:34:02] <f-a> want to share?
[04:34:05] <BrokenClutch> https://gitlab.com/UnrelatedMicrowave/press-the-button
[04:34:06] <ManofLetters[m]> cool! what kind of game?
[04:34:15] <BrokenClutch> a very complex and difficult one
[04:34:22] <BrokenClutch> you must press A BUTTON
[04:34:40] <ManofLetters[m]> dare I?
[04:34:42] <BrokenClutch> like, I was seeing if it's possible to write stuff in haskell
[04:35:13] <BrokenClutch> "down" makes you go down, "up" "left" "right" make stuff too
[04:35:22] <BrokenClutch> you can "press", "yell" or "lick"
[04:35:38] <ManofLetters[m]> incredible
[04:35:49] <ManofLetters[m]> ;D
[04:35:54] <BrokenClutch> ty
[04:41:45] <EvanR> keep going
[04:42:18] <BrokenClutch> me?
[04:43:01] <EvanR> expand the gameplay with more shit
[04:49:40] <BrokenClutch> Like, why would I? This is just a test, but I want to do more stuff
[04:49:45] <BrokenClutch> will link it here later
[04:52:08] <EvanR> ok good
[04:54:58] <sm1> needs more screenshot!
[04:55:07] <sm1> go BrokenClutch go
[04:55:10] <f-a> BrokenClutch: you might want to include a .cabal file in your repo (for people like me!)
[04:59:18] <f-a> 9> "you licked the floor, you've died of ligma"
[04:59:22] <f-a> 2022 appropriate
[05:00:39] <EvanR> it's so 2022
[05:01:13] <f-a> BrokenClutch: I won it! an easy suggestion if you want one: why not clearning the screen after command? That would make it easier to follow the game
[05:10:25] <BrokenClutch> f-a: I've made the game just for a test, But i didn't thought this. If the next one run on the terminal, I'll implement it
[05:10:55] <BrokenClutch> f-a: What's a .cabal file?
[05:11:37] <BrokenClutch> I will add one, I just don't know what it is
[05:12:16] <BrokenClutch> I've almost made the button position random, but man, I didn't want to do much with just a test
[05:13:34] <f-a> BrokenClutch: if you plan to keep using the terminal to make games, I will spam my library that you might find useful at least as an inspiration https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal-game
[05:13:50] <EvanR> randomIO is pretty easy
[05:13:56] <EvanR> if you have IO
[05:14:20] <f-a> sm1: can stack generate a .cabal file or do you need to use hpack? Also is it considered curteous to add one?
[05:17:53] <BrokenClutch> f-a: I will probably try one more on the terminal, I'm now gonna try to understand Elerea and see if I can write some simple FRP lib
[05:18:28] <BrokenClutch> But the next one will be way more complex, probably will resemble a game, with more well written rules
[05:19:33] <f-a> well done!
[05:19:39] <f-a> keep it simple and remember to share here
[05:19:48] <BrokenClutch> This language is awesome, so while we don't have a good cross compiling scheme compiler i I'll continue to use haskell
[05:21:31] <f-a> which scheme do you use
[05:21:34] <f-a> scheme is pretty rad too
[05:21:47] <BrokenClutch> On linux i use bigloo
[05:22:01] <BrokenClutch> because bigloo is awesome
[05:22:27] <BrokenClutch> Thank you all for checking it, Gonna play some Jupiter Hell now
[05:42:09] <sm1> f-a: yes it can, `stack [--resolver RESOLVER] init`, and yes it's a good idea to include a .cabal if you want others to build it
[05:43:08] * sm1 investigates Jupiter Hell
[05:43:32] <EvanR> top-down doom
[05:45:46] <sm1> ooh. ok, we're talking that kind of graphics. I was expecting ascii :)
[06:00:07] <BrokenClutch> Not gonna do anything like Jupiter Hell, like, I'm probably gonna make some dumb furry eroge games (but this is gonna be too NSFWy for here)
[06:01:22] <f-a> I composed music for a furry game
[06:01:44] <f-a> for whatever reason there seems to be a thriving market
[06:06:47] <BrokenClutch> man, there is a reason, and I can't write here
[06:10:33] <EvanR> well at least this channel isn't infested with anime KNOCK ON WOOD
[06:10:42] <f-a> reason is: furries are lewd. Future historians will for sure be puzzled by this kind of mecenatism
[08:12:29] <EvanR> I wrote some code earlier in IO and it doesn't actually do any I/O
[08:12:42] <EvanR> so now I'm trying to rewrite it to be pure
[08:13:01] <EvanR> but then beer
[08:14:24] <EvanR> no I/O but there are some IORefs and existentials
