[07:40:34] <fizzie> Are these square matrices you've got there? 
[07:40:39] <Batzy> no
[07:40:51] <Batzy> but a matrix times its transpose is square
[07:41:08] <Batzy> AtA is where im storing the result

[07:46:12] <cousteau> I have no idea what `Eigen::MatrixXd` is, but don't you need to specify the size of the matrix when initializing it?

[07:50:49] <cousteau> then try 2x3 and if everything breaks then you know you messed up one of the dimensions
[07:50:53] <Batzy> besides i told you what i did, i said AtA(n,n) and AtA.setZero(); I can print it and see an nxn matrix of all 0s

[07:54:05] <Batzy> imagine having an inkling of a hint about why this is segfaulting
[07:54:10] <cousteau> weird function; it seems to use the C parameter as both input and output...
[07:54:25] <Batzy> meh not really
[07:54:35] <Batzy> i jsut set beta to 0 and it doesn't add C
[07:54:44] <Batzy> you would use it to "accumulate" values i guess
[07:54:46] <cousteau> (shouldn't matter because you just said that C is initialized to 0's anyway)
[07:54:55] <Batzy> yep
[07:54:59] <Batzy> im convinced it has nothing to do
[07:55:00] <Batzy> with C
[07:55:18] <cousteau> well yeah but multiplying an undefined number by 0 is still undefined.  Unless 0 is a special case in the function.  But if it's defined (as 0) it shouldn't matter.
[07:55:46] <cousteau> what does the .data() method return?  what's its type?  is it a double* or a const double*?
[07:56:12] <Batzy> it's a pointer to the start of the array
[07:56:28] <Batzy> cousteau: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TopicStorageOrders.html talked about in here
[07:56:44] <cousteau> "a pointer" isn't too specific...
[07:57:02] <Batzy> It uses the PlainObjectBase::data() function, which returns a pointer to the memory location of the first entry of the matrix.
[07:59:16] <cousteau> ok, it seems that it has a Scalar *data() and a const Scalar *data() const methods...
[07:59:24] <cousteau> stupid overloading...
[08:00:32] <cousteau> do a dumber test: AtA.data()[0] = 3;
[08:00:34] <cousteau> see if that works
[08:01:41] <cousteau> if that fails, the problem is that you cannot assign stuff to the .data() like that
[08:02:24] <Batzy> you can
[08:02:47] <cousteau> if it works, you could try to see if it still works within a custom function, like   void set00to42(double *data) { data[0] = 42; }

[08:09:01] <cousteau> as an idea, you could copy-paste that code into your program, rename it to dgemm_2 for example, and see if it works or fails.  If it fails, you can further debug the function.

[17:53:13] <dave0> Guest9: extern is optional on function declarations... i personally use extern anyway
[17:53:34] <Guest9> Right, making it explicit would make code more readable.

[18:00:48] <dave0> Guest9: the normal way is put   extern int var;   in a header file and #include the header file anywhere you want to use var (including the file that actually defines var)
[18:00:54] <Guest9> In other words, A.c can have int var = 10 but B.c cannot have int var = 10? Just var?

[19:35:31] <barthandelous> Depending on how expensive the simulation is, you could adjust the number of samples you take
[19:35:50] *** Joins: lemontree (~chat@user/lemontree)
[19:36:27] <Kit> wdym by simulate, like compare them against the known answers?
[19:37:54] <barthandelous> Essentially, yes
[19:38:03] <barthandelous> Test each possible answer from the sample
[19:38:16] <barthandelous> Then pick the one that ends up increasing your certainty the most and ask that

[23:32:24] <pert> extern: do you mean like how the low-level parts of an operating system are implemented, or what types of interfaces operating systems expose to applications?
[23:32:45] <extern> both
[23:35:11] <cousteau> I remember there was a cool book about driver programming I never got to read.  I think it was "Linux system programming" but I'm not sure it was that one
[23:35:27] <pert> I really like Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, which mostly cpvers the latter. It details the vast majority of interfaces that UNIX systems provide, but also addresses implementation-specific hiccups and explains how the interfaces work under-the-hood. I'm not sure that it's what you're looking for though
[23:37:25] <extern> cousteau: linux system programming is good but it talks about "system calls" when in fact what you doing is calling system calls wrappers through libc
