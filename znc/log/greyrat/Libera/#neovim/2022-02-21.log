[01:41:25] <dundargoc> More luajit = more performance
[01:42:02] <jamessan[m]> Apparently there's some incompatible change between the two versions, so the nvim built against the system version crashes

[19:13:25] <benallanbenallan> Thanks a lot! I was looking at apt or snap as it would be a bit easier to use with an ansible deployment, but I'll take a look at building it instead.
[19:13:26] <benallanbenallan> * Hi, does anyone know how to install neovim with luajit on Ubuntu arm? I tried the neovim ppa, and also the snap store, but both look like they were compiled with plan lua 5.1. Is the only option to compile from source?

[22:26:44] <BennyPowers[m]> is there a debounce function in the neovim library?
[22:27:02] <Friithian> debounce? Like, key press debounce?
[22:27:23] <dundargoc> `debounce_text_changes` I think it's called
[22:28:13] <mjlbach[m]> BennyPowers[m]: no
[22:28:42] <dundargoc> I mean no, there isn't one.
[22:31:09] <smolck> dundargoc: should there be?
[22:31:21] <smolck> regardless it should be pretty easy with a `vim.loop` timer or something, idk
[22:31:31] <mjlbach[m]> A built-in debounce function?
[22:31:54] <mjlbach[m]> I feel like it's often implementation specific, we have internal debouncing in the ls client for example
[22:31:55] <smolck> yeah
[22:32:44] <smolck> mjlbach[m]: is it? I figure as long as you can pass in the function and the debounce time it should be pretty general? or is that not the case?
[22:37:56] <dundargoc> <smolck> "is it? I figure as long as you..." <- "I agree that you do not see how."
[22:38:33] <smolck> dundargoc: I know you're joking, but I mean, yes, sure. Now I'm asking why?
[22:39:03] <dundargoc> 🤷‍♂️

[22:40:50] <dundargoc> I think that's already part of the twitter curricullum
[22:41:27] <Friithian> the default is just scream and implode if there is no other option

[22:44:26] <mjlbach[m]> I mean like writing a debounce function is like 10 lines, having a generic 10 line wrapper is IMO not that useful
[22:44:50] <mjlbach[m]> all of the work is in the implementation, managing the triggers, what resets the timer, etc.
[22:44:59] <mjlbach[m]> idk mathias probably has a better opinion than I

[22:45:38] <Friithian> what exactly is being debounced anyway?
[22:46:02] <mjlbach[m]> Friithian: wdym
[22:46:03] <dundargoc> 10 lines? Noob. `sleep(0.01)`
[22:46:14] <mjlbach[m]> do you mean what do we currently debounce in core?
[22:46:28] <Friithian> well we're tlaking about a debounce function, what do you want to debounce?
[22:46:42] <mjlbach[m]> Or what would people like to hypothetically debounce?
[22:47:01] <Friithian> hypothetically
[22:48:00] <mjlbach[m]> Well, I don't think adding a debounce function to the stdlib is useful, but we current debounce textDocument/didChange for sending change results to language servers as a way of throttling updates
[22:48:22] <mjlbach[m]> It's most often used in completion plugins
[22:49:30] <Friithian> ok that makes sense
[22:51:44] <Mathias[m]1> I don't know how a generic debounce in neovim should behave. In some cases (like javascript) it ignores subsequent events (keypresses, mouseclicks) - there it kinda makes sense, but in neovim I suspect the behavior depends a lot more on the use case. For some you'd want to cancel the action on InsertLeave. For completion you might not want to re-trigger at all on certain conditions, e.g if pum is visible and you have the complete result
[22:51:44] <Mathias[m]1> already. Considering all this, a higher level API doesn't really make sense - the timer from vim.loop gives you the control you need and it is not too difficult to use
[22:52:05] <Mathias[m]1> * makes sense to have a debounce(func,, * , timeout), but in
