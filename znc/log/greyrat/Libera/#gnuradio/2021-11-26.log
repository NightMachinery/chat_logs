[01:16:38] <muaddib[m]> Both are good in their own right. But yes, Watch the 1984 version first. Since yes, it‚Äôs the full story.
[01:16:46] <muaddib[m]> s/yes,//
[01:30:39] <DerekKozel[m]> Agreed. 1984 is wonderful and definitely worth a watch. The book is worth reading in addition to either/both movies
[01:31:27] <DerekKozel[m]> The first two sequels aren't bad either, but the main book is self contained and just iconic (though not without grounds for critical thinking)
[01:32:45] <DerekKozel[m]> Then by all means watch the new movie, it was well done but I am interested in what someone who hadn't read the book or seen the previous movie thinks about the plot. A huge amount is (out of necessity) glossed over/missing

[02:23:47] <drmpeg> I re-watched the 1984 version. The acting is so stiff. Kyle MacLachlan looks like he's on Quaaludes.
[02:26:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> I saw it when it first came out ( get off my Lawn). I thought it was OK.
[02:26:53] <Hoernchen> there is also the scifi miniseries, also 20 years old by now. low budget sfx, but i'd say it had more meat and fewer pretty views than the newest half-dune....
[02:29:05] <jacekowski> muaddib[m]: most likely still a random thing, the reason why phising works is because it is very often something you are expecting
[02:31:29] <jacekowski> muaddib[m]: a while back i got phishing email from "fedex" asking for card details for payment of import duties, at the same time i knew i had a parcel coming from abroad 
[02:32:09] <jacekowski> muaddib[m]: if it wasn't for the currency not being correct i would have probably not realised it was a phishing email (and i supposed they would later asked for a lot more details)
[02:41:39] <muaddib[m]> Agreed, I always have to remember that just because something CAN happen definitely doesn‚Äôt mean it IS happening.

[16:41:35] <jemius> I have a problem. The scheduler often expects me to produce very few samples (i.e. 16 or 4). But my block *can not* produce so few samples. I "handle" this by returning 0 in general_work and wait for some bigger packets to be requested. Sometimes, however, the scheduler will never demand more than 16 samples... Am I now screwed?
[16:42:52] <BarryDuggan[m]> wouldn't a `forecast` take care of that for you?
[16:45:42] <Hoernchen> lol, 16?
[16:46:24] <willcode4[m]> jemius: `set_output_multiple()` make sure `work()` is called only when a multiple of some number of items can be output. `forecast()` tells the scheduler how many input items are needed to produce that amount of output.

[16:48:05] <willcode4[m]> This seems to be a very popular question these days. We should put together an example somewhere we can point to. Is everyone solving the same problem at once?
[16:49:13] <willcode4[m]> jemius: Call `set_output_multiple()` from your init. `forecast()` is something you implement, and it is called by the scheduler. See https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/BlocksCodingGuide.
[16:50:26] <jemius> willcode4[m], yep, I know forecast(). The issue is that my block's outputs have different amounts they produce. So forecast() is trimmed for the minimum-case, whereas the whole block then must consume far less than the requested items, so that the high-rate output does not produce too much
[16:50:51] <BarryDuggan[m]> it's mentioned in https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Types_of_Blocks but no example

[18:11:36] <willcode4[m]> Barry Duggan: This is a real hack, but it might work. Since the UDP Source can do zero-fill, use a UDP Sink/Source inline. It should not be difficult to write a simpler version of a block that inserts samples into a zero-filled stream (as gr-eventstream does). It would either use sob/eob tags or take a "multiple" param of some sort. I can't think of a block we have that's usable off the shelf for this right now. Some are close.

[18:34:18] <Notou[m]> Oh, I didn't know that the UDP source could do zero-fill, that's a nice addition. The only caveat being the packet size limitation.
[18:34:18] <Notou[m]> Barry Duggan Did you try to add a throttle block before your EPB as I suggested? 
[18:38:05] <jemius> Cool, I think my insane receiver works now, after 3 months of hating code together

[22:32:42] <luisherasme[m]> <Yamakaja[m]> "luisherasme: Also, is there a..." <- Because I use the module gr-limesdr and the gnuradio that comes with PothosSDR has it by default (easier to install). 
[22:35:49] <luisherasme[m]> > <@johannes:demel.tech> Start with a structure where you add noise only. This helps to sort out issues.
[22:35:49] <luisherasme[m]> > It seems like you use 16QAM. That's a tricky constellation for most traditional single carrier sync algorithms. They were developed for PSK modulation. This might cause issues. How does your constellation look like for QPSK? In any case, I'd recommend to start with QPSK, make sure everything you need works with that simple constellation and then move to more sophisticated constellations.
[22:35:50] <luisherasme[m]> > You might want to compare your constellation with whatever comes right out of your "Channel model" block and after polyphase clock sync.
[22:35:50] <luisherasme[m]> I was working with QPSK and 8PSK because the GNURadio has good documentation about it, but I don't find anything about 16QAM in the official documentation.
[22:36:28] <willcode4[m]> luisherasme: The `limesuite` package includes the Soapy driver for lime. That works with 3.8, 3.9, master, and Pothos.

[22:40:41] <luisherasme[m]> willcode4[m]: You mean that there is an easy way to install GNUradio 3.8 - 3.9 with support for limesdr?
[22:43:08] <willcode4[m]> Yes. For 3.8, install gr-soapy (OOT). For 3.9, gr-soapy is included (depending on how it was packaged/built). LimeSuite includes the SoapyLMS7 driver.
[22:43:53] <willcode4[m]> "easy" is always relative here, of course üòÄ
[22:43:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> I have Ubuntu 21.10.  It has LimeSuite stuff in the repos.   Easy peasy.

[22:45:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> The only one I had to install from external goop was SDRPLAY.
[22:46:20] <luisherasme[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: In the documentation I see ways to install it in Linux but not in windows 
[22:47:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> Ah.  I have zero clue about Windows, but I understand that "conda" is the way to enlightenment there.  But, YMMV, etc, etc.
[22:47:36] <willcode4[m]> Same.
