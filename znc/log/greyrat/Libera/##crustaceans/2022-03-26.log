[02:14:14] <epilys> also from that thread "This technique, where a type parameter is used for type safety but not actually used at runtime, has a name: phantom types." I'm 99.9% sure this is totally wrong?
[02:15:59] <drakonis> lol r7rs-large might actually happen within my lifetime
[02:16:12] <drakonis> phantom types...
[02:16:16] <drakonis> i've heard that before

[02:22:23] <drakonis> no, these are monads
[02:23:03] <drakonis> phantom and poltergeist types haunt your code
[02:23:55] <epilys> a spectre haunts Programming, the spectre of type safety.
[02:25:13] <epilys> also from that thread: "My experience is that this class of bugs is relatively uncommon and easy to catch/fix."
[02:25:38] <epilys> this is the same problem with C integers casting and all the bugs it causes.
[02:26:02] <drakonis> fun

[09:50:41] <kline> what else happened
[09:50:41] <kronk> fuck today and all of its hours, minutes and seconds.
[09:52:14] <kronk> mother's front tooth broke off, I hit a mental low (happens every couple of months), a lovely retrocomputing museum in ukraine was destroyed, parents almost got into the middle of a deadly car chase which freaked everybody out, and some absolute fuckstain had the gall to demand my team work on their issue _despite it being 10 at night on a friday_.
[09:52:47] <kronk> (we didn't cave to the request, politely told them to go pound sand until we got to it on monday, and I am not a sympathetic worker.)
[09:53:01] <kline> man, thats fucked up
[09:53:08] <kronk> yeah fuck today.
[09:53:24] <kline> well done on getting through, you have anything planned for the weekend?
[09:53:48] <kronk> honestly, not really.
[09:54:20] <kronk> https://chat.imode.tech/uploads/d35d67e79623c87b/effort.png
[09:54:34] <kronk> I think my brain finally came out.
[09:54:37] <kronk> and burnt out.
[09:54:47] <kronk> like climbed out of my skull and said "later fam".
[09:54:56] <kline> well, i hope if you can that you chill out tomorrow/sunday
[09:55:20] <kronk> all those nice blue squares are CRs, which can span multiple commits. I submitted 44 CRs one of those saturdays.
[09:55:34] <kline> thats something else
[09:55:37] <kronk> the processor is overheated.
[09:56:23] <kronk> mm, ice cream mochi
[09:57:05] <defect> i found some real fun bullshit at 5pm today. things like one of our services is running 40% as user nobody, and 60% as root
[09:57:08] <defect> what could go wrong?
[09:57:18] <kronk> ...how the fuck do you have a split like that.
[09:57:22] <kronk> that's awesome.
[09:57:44] <defect> because someone started to move over to using nobody, and then... i guess forgot about the project
[09:58:04] <kronk> I love when someone just abandons a fucking migration halfway through.
[09:58:08] <defect> hah yeah
[09:58:25] <kronk> a buddy of mine was nursing a build that took a _week_.
[09:58:43] <defect> and i can just imagine the shitshow that would ensue if someone canaries some changes on the 60% that runs as root, and it works hunky dory
[09:58:46] <kronk> fixing a codebase migration that was started 10 years ago.
[09:58:49] <defect> then deploys it and takes out 40% of prod
[10:00:18] <kronk> do you at least have visibility on those failures. I came across a $4m accounting bleed today due to the visibility stuff I'm working on.
[10:00:40] <kronk> "yeah the accounting team validated like 5 transactions and signed off on it"
[10:01:16] <kronk> is it legal to beat someone to death with a copy of excel.
[10:01:18] <defect> if 40% of this service starts crashing we'll notice :P
[10:02:05] <defect> but it's one of those services where unavailability can cost quite a bit
[10:03:02] <kronk>  boy do I know that.
[10:03:35] <kronk> if someone fucks up our service we're non-SOX compliant.
[10:04:01] <kronk> then fun people in suits get to talk to us.
[10:05:11] <defect> yeah, we don't have that in my team. just hella revenue loss
[10:05:42] <kronk> at least that's hypothetical. weep for the downstream that handles the revenue.
[10:06:44] <kronk> "I hate upstream." should be a badge.
[10:08:24] <defect> fair enough
[10:10:44] <kronk> imagine hiring some of the most inexperienced devs (one of them was a contractor that was here for _30 days_ and was asking "how 2 git & guice") and having them grok complicated accounting requirements, and translating that into what amounts to JSON++ with a limited testing framework and little to no recourse if something catastrophically blows up.
[10:10:57] <defect> in any case, my plan is to fix it and make sure my extremely excellent skills in finding and fixing bullshit shows up on my performance review
[10:11:26] <kronk> multiply that by 300 product launches.
[10:11:48] <kronk> compensation makes it all worthwhile.
[10:13:14] <kronk> perf. review is nice if it's followed by a corresponding increase in comp. money talks.
[10:20:46] <kronk> someone just set off a loud firework. if I hear that again there's going to be a homicide.
