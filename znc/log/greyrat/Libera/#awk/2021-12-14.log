[00:09:05] <rendar> `awk -va="${line_start}" -vb="${line_end}" 'index($0, a) == 1 && index($0, b) == length + 1 - length(b)'`  i use this code to match lines with a start and with an end, but it seems it has a bug
[00:09:17] <rendar> when end lengths overlaps, it wrongly matches the line
[00:09:27] <rendar> any help to make this working good?
[00:10:08] <emanuele6> i guess it would print a line even if it does not end in b if length($0) happens to be one shorter than b
[00:11:09] <rendar> maybe
[00:11:20] <rendar> any help to fix this?
[00:11:36] <emanuele6> check that the index of b is not 0
[00:12:17] <emanuele6> or that length is greater than the length of b
[00:12:38] <rendar> 'index($0, a) == 1 && index($0, b) == length + 1 - length(b) && length > length(b)' ?
[00:13:09] <emanuele6> i would use greater equal
[00:13:48] <emanuele6> index($0, a) == 1 && (bindex = index($0, b)) == length + 1 - length(b) && bindex 
[00:13:53] <emanuele6> or something like that
[00:14:27] <rendar> ok

[21:48:16] <Patsie> sorta, but not quite. the 2 -> 3 chars had me confused for a bit, but figured out that it's actually quite perfect
[21:50:14] <e36freak> http://ix.io/3IpH
[21:53:00] <emanuele6> https://0x0.st/-FDp.txt
[21:53:10] <nmz1> https://ivo.palli.nl/2021/12/14/using-gawk-interactively-to-query-a-database/ TIL of stdbuf
[21:54:09] <e36freak> emanuele6: pretty much the exact same thing
[21:54:20] <emanuele6> yeah
[21:57:31] <seninha> I could only see the proper way to solve it after reading e36freak's code: https://github.com/phillbush/aoc/blob/master/2021/day14b
[21:59:24] <Patsie> e36freak: ah, ofcourse, I could have used substr(str,i,2) as well. silly me never thought or that, just did it char by char :P
[21:59:59] <emanuele6> `delete a' is an extension iirc
[22:01:11] <Patsie> emanuele6: it's supported by most if not all awk dialects and is also part of the posix standard as of a late(r) revision
[22:01:47] <Patsie> e36freak: ans also nice to just count each char of a pair. I counted all chars and divided by two
[22:02:03] <Patsie> each char == each first char*
[22:02:31] <seninha> According to gawk's manual, delete without array index is now POSIX: https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#POSIX
[22:02:40] <emanuele6> i didn't know that
[22:03:06] <seninha> "In 2012, a number of extensions that had been commonly available for many years were finally added to POSIX."
[22:03:35] <emanuele6> wow, also fflush() and nextfile
[22:04:06] <Patsie> e36freak: even ran into an off-by-one, because I didn't count the first&last chars twice :P
[22:05:25] <emanuele6> the awk standard at the page they linked does not mention fflush() and nextfile, weird
[22:05:41] <emanuele6> The 2018 POSIX standard can be found online at https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/.
[22:06:20] <e36freak> Patsie: so did i
[22:06:34] <e36freak> seninha: saw it on reddit?
[22:07:47] <Patsie> I think seninha is missing the off-by-one
[22:07:57] *** Joins: ryu` (~ryusaku@c09825BC1.dhcp.as2116.net)
[22:08:16] <Patsie> oh no, found it
[22:09:36] <seninha> e36freak: yep. Thanks, btw.
[22:09:43] <e36freak> heh, no problem
[22:10:13] <seninha> I was struggling to see the solution. Then I saw yours and realized how dumb I am.
[22:10:46] <e36freak> i took longer than i'd like to figure it out
[22:10:57] <e36freak> having done the lanternfish already helped big time
[22:14:54] <Patsie> yeah, had a bit of a struggle here too. I had the general idea, but didn't think the 3 characters would 'work', only to see later that that's just 2 pairs again :P
[22:20:57] <e36freak> the off-by-one is what killed me the most, trying to figure out where it was coming from
