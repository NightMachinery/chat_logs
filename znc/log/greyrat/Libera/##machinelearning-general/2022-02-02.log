[00:00:24] <hodapp> in a language like Haskell - for instance - there is never a difference in using a variable or using its value
[00:01:18] <hodapp> in other languages, a variable has other things exposed, e.g. an address that can be referenced explicitly or some other kind of ID that can be compared
[00:02:18] <hodapp> and especially, if a variable is mutable, its name and a specific value can become uncoupled at some arbitrary time
[00:04:09] <theseb> dostoyevsky2: well the reason it is interesting to me is i spend a lot of time doing JSON....everything is key value pairs....so it was interesting that there was an isomorphism with all these C++ vars..that is all
[00:04:28] <theseb> and python vars and c vars and ...
[00:08:28] <hodapp> that isn't really an isomorphism though; it cannot represent every arrangement of variables in C++, and isn't really any direct way to represent (for instance) arbitrary dictionaries in JSON in C/C++
[00:10:37] <theseb> hodapp: whoa...a variable is a SINGLE key value pair
[00:10:47] <theseb> hodapp: for a dict you'd of course need multiple vars
[00:10:51] <theseb> like in a C struct

[12:13:22] <Jong> I feel that ROC is explained horribly.   It's actually quit simple.    Suppose we have a silhouette of a circle that serves as the ground truth and another imagine containing a circle that's the inference of a neural network. The two overlap forming a venn diagram.  Now compute two numbers. Call them y and x.   y = intersection area / ground truth area;  x = (inference mask - intersection) / background area.         ROC is operation but done
[12:13:22] <Jong>  many times, each with the model teaked a bit different to see which has the best ROC numbers.
[12:15:02] <Jong> By overlap I mean if you were to stack the ground truth image and inference image on top of each other

[13:56:06] <lericson> ROC is easy to understand if you understand ROC
[13:57:03] <lericson> the easiest way to explain it is with a covid test, do you tune it to always find positive cases, or do you tune it to never find negative cases
[13:57:58] <Hunts> Jong: if you mean receiver operating characteristics, I don't see your how your example relates to ROC
[13:59:09] <Jong> It's not this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jRBRDbJemM&t=463s

[14:01:14] *** Joins: sinaowolabi_ (~SinaOwola@102.134.114.1)
[14:02:50] <Jong> In my example, the ground truth output is an image with white pixels as background and black pixels forming a circle treated as the foreground, and inference computes a pixel-level "is this part of the circle?" mask of the image.
[14:03:12] <Hunts> that sounds already complicated
[14:03:18] <lericson> yeah lol :p
[14:03:28] <Jong> it's just semantic segmentation
[14:05:16] <Jong> How about creating a mask of the tennis ball is in an image.
[14:07:11] <Hunts> yes, but that is way complicated compared to test scores for example (like a covid test and setting a threhsold there)
[14:08:35] <Jong> It's not easier to visualize?  For example "True Positives + False Negatives" is really just the foreground of the ground truth image.
[14:09:22] <Jong> "overlapping region over ground truth mask" is easy to visualize and remember isn't it?
[14:13:45] <Jong> Okay, thanks for the feedback. I was proven wrong in thinking my example would be easy for others to understand quickly
