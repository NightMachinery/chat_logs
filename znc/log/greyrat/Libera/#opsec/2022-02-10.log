[01:55:33] <Joanna> I’m no expert on every technical detail of remote computing but judging by how badly the things I know about are designed, it’s probably not that well  designed. Probably put together in a hurry for expedience an left that way with many flaws.

[03:06:08] <Joanna> It’s seems that all focus on botnets is placed upon who made the botnet and what did it do rather than why it’s possible to sneak malware onto people’s computers without their permission. I’m willing to bet that operating system makers like Microsoft have control of all computers using their os if they ever choose to use it just like a botnet owner.
