[12:00:16] <Vohveli> right, because she doesn't want her to fans to see her unhappy
[12:00:41] <Nanobot> amigojapan: Coco has talked about how Cover has been increasingly restricting what people can do in their streams (which is a natural consequence of the company growing and having to deal with more public scrutiny), and she's clearly unhappy with that. That's probably a big factor in why she's leaving: She wants more freedom to do the stuff that she wants to do. That doesn't mean the company is kicking her out.
[12:00:42] <amigojapan> You guys claim it is from her own volition but she say that.
[12:01:08] <Vohveli> she has said that

[14:54:49] <amigojapan> You must be catching a cold
[14:55:05] <spoonm> what makes you say that?
[14:55:10] <amigojapan> Oh spoonm , I hope it goes well
[14:55:24] <amigojapan> spoonm: your sneeze sound
[14:55:41] <spoonm> I thought for a second you'd reference the fact it's winter in the southern hemisphere
[14:55:54] <spoonm> it's not very cold where I live, and I do live in a tropical country, so there's that
[14:56:03] <amigojapan> Ah. I am aware of that too
[14:56:16] <spoonm> I think the people interviewing me this time will ask me to share my screen
[14:56:46] <spoonm> I'll quit the irc client minutes before the interview just in case
[14:57:01] <amigojapan> Oh remote interview. I don't think sharing screen is very common. At least not in Japan
[14:57:11] <spoonm> don't want any surprise notifications saying "spoonm, where are the dick pics you promised me?" or something to that effect
[14:57:25] <amigojapan> Lol yeah
[14:57:57] <spoonm> the title for the "step" in the hiring process is "quem sabe faz ao vivo", or "those who know it, do it live", and I was told to prepare my development environment, so I'm expecting them to ask me to develop something right then and there
[14:58:04] <spoonm> I just hope it's nothing too difficult

[15:01:38] <spoonm> the 'game' consisted of a prompt saying 'think of a dish you like', and then it would try to guess at what you thought of by traversing a binary tree, and if it couldn't have guessed it by the time you reached a leaf, it would ask you to insert the name of the dish and an adjective that applied to it but not to the last guess it tried to make
[15:02:16] <spoonm> if I hadn't added docstrings it would've been maybe 30 lines total, and that's because the lady asked me to make it as "object oriented" as possible
[15:02:34] <spoonm> so now I'm wondering what they have for me this time around

[15:08:19] <PancakeMatsuri> with 6 steps
[15:09:52] <spoonm> I'm gonna go take a look at the steps
[15:11:49] <spoonm> it goes: 1. sending resume/CV, 2. profile assessment, 3. triage (filtering?), 4. culture fit (interview with HR), 5. technical challenge (the one I did), 6. correction for said challenge (they do this), 7. interview with technical team (the people who graded/looked over it?), 8. welcome aboard!

[16:35:33] <Sumida> people who can feed themselves get to stay in japan
[16:35:34] <amigojapan> Not a big fan of gojira GojiraKatrin 
[16:35:42] <GojiraKatrin> q.q
[16:35:52] <GojiraKatrin> amigojapan: I think the noise it makes is very kawaii
[16:35:54] <Sumida> got no job? then you're not needed
[16:36:20] <mitsuda> Sumida: that's the feeling i get
[16:36:28] <mitsuda> i think it's completely fine
[16:36:38] <Sumida> that is typical of most countries I think
[16:36:51] <amigojapan> GojiraKatrin: maybe cause it is partly babies noises
[16:37:04] <GojiraKatrin> amigojapan: maybe
[16:37:20] <GojiraKatrin> Lately I have been thinking
[16:37:40] <mitsuda> Sumida: but they wouldn't take in refugees i think
[16:37:41] <GojiraKatrin> If it was possible for me to become a mother, I'd actually kinda like that I think.
[16:37:53] <mitsuda> or let people cross the border illegally
[16:37:53] <spoonm> sorry, I was on the toilet, amigojapan 
[16:38:02] <amigojapan> mitsuda: we have refugees here in my city
[16:38:12] <spoonm> amigojapan: all you need to set up is mumble, yes, but if you're on Android you won't have noise suppression
[16:38:14] <GojiraKatrin> amigojapan: did you know that the medical technology to make that possible already exists?
[16:38:29] <spoonm> I recommend installing any GNU/Linux distro that is a one-click install like Ubuntu
[16:38:32] <amigojapan> I see spoonm 
[16:38:32] <spoonm> or even run it through a live USB
[16:38:39] <GojiraKatrin> But it requires an organ donnor and immuno supression and is obviously not a routine intervention yet.
[16:38:54] <Sumida> refugees are few. I think it was 47 in total last year
[16:39:09] <GojiraKatrin> I hope they can labgrow organs perfectly fit in a feew years
[16:39:10] <Sumida> which was not a normal year of course
[16:39:21] <amigojapan> spoonm: can I install packages on a live USB install. Even if it only lasts for that session?
[16:39:28] <spoonm> yeah
[16:39:34] <GojiraKatrin> It's already possible to labgrow vaginas, so it's within the realm of doable.
[16:40:05] <amigojapan> Sumida: we have many curds living here in Kawaguchi
[16:40:14] <Sumida> I assume refugees are not weebs
[16:40:27] <GojiraKatrin> And lately my hands are giving out, maybe I should have them replaced with cyborg hands.
[16:40:45] <amigojapan> Sumida: no. They don't even usually marry Japanese
[16:41:02] <GojiraKatrin> amigojapan: I am starting to have trouble using keyboards and I am only 31
[16:41:28] <GojiraKatrin> Don't know if this is because of peripheral or central nervous damage
[16:41:31] <amigojapan> GojiraKatrin: use a touch screen
[16:41:47] <GojiraKatrin> amigojapan: my mbp has no touch screen q.q
[16:42:34] <amigojapan> GojiraKatrin: pretty sure you can use any phone as an input device with the right app/driver
[16:43:00] <GojiraKatrin> amigojapan: I don't think that would improve things much
[16:43:07] <GojiraKatrin> I need a hands free input somehow
[16:43:13] <davic> spoonm: hi you fat fuck
[16:43:27] <amigojapan> GojiraKatrin: voice recognition
[16:43:31] <GojiraKatrin> amigojapan: the spastics are starting to get really painful lately

[17:43:10] <KatrinValerie> if you are very much trapped in the depressive spiral, it can be helpful to have a therapy session on LSD or MDMA.

[18:17:58] <KatrinValerie> He used to keep his family afloat all on his own
[18:18:03] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[18:18:07] <amigojapan> mitsuda: inu nan biki means some dogs
[18:18:15] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: he instantly gets fired for not turning up to work once
[18:18:23] <KatrinValerie> his family feeds him at first
[18:18:35] <KatrinValerie> but eventually he dies after family members attack him
[18:19:06] <amigojapan> Ok KatrinValerie 
[18:19:10] <gildarts> How did Steven Crowder come up?
[18:19:35] <KatrinValerie> gildarts: he was recently trolled by h3h3
[18:19:44] <gildarts> Who?
[18:19:49] <KatrinValerie> The Vape Nation guy
[18:19:56] <gildarts> The what guy?

[18:20:14] <KatrinValerie> Crowder challanged him to a debate

[18:20:33] *** Joins: OmegaHarvest (~OmegaHarv@20.77.40.208)

[18:20:41] <KatrinValerie> And Crowder nopes the fuck out
[18:20:46] <gildarts> Don't know who that is either.
[18:20:59] <KatrinValerie> Just some lefty youtuber with a million followers
[18:21:12] <KatrinValerie> Crowder avoided a debate with him in the past.
[18:21:22] <KatrinValerie> And a whole lot of right wing youtubers do not want to debate him either.
[18:21:44] <KatrinValerie> gildarts: You probably heard of Jordon Peterson
[18:21:51] <amigojapan> gildarts: you are not alone
[18:22:04] <KatrinValerie> He'd portrait himself as a great debater by arguing with college students
[18:22:24] <KatrinValerie> He basically would just interrupt them so they couldn't get their point across
[18:22:30] <KatrinValerie> He never was good in real debates
[18:22:45] <KatrinValerie> Whenever he debates someone with actual experience, he looks really stupid.
[18:22:56] <gildarts> KatrinValerie: It is hard to have not heard of Peterson. Though I wouldn't have said that I've seen him characterize himself as a good debater.
[18:23:30] <KatrinValerie> gildarts: Oh he certainly does, also his diet suggestions are dangerous
[18:23:48] <KatrinValerie> The dude almost died because he only ate meat and got really bad scurvy
[18:23:56] <KatrinValerie> Which is a big lol as well
[18:24:04] <Poeticode> all thanks to listening to his crazy daughter
[18:24:08] <KatrinValerie> Also he was addicted to anti anixety meds
[18:24:10] <gildarts> Also, being good at debating is tangential to the quality of your position/points.

[18:24:28] <gildarts> How is any of this related to ##anime, out of curiosity?
[18:24:29] <KatrinValerie> Oh yeah, she's a psychopath
[18:24:52] <KatrinValerie> Poeticode: she likes to pull the strings from the background I think.
[18:25:01] <KatrinValerie> gildarts: not at all :D

[18:34:21] <mitsuda> amigojapan: natto? what's that?
[18:35:39] <KatrinValerie> mitsuda: a gross fermented food
[18:35:59] <beaky> is it oishii
[18:36:00] <KatrinValerie> it's so sticky that you can choke on it
[18:37:13] <amigojapan> mitsuda: natto is a food that is famously hated by foreigners
[18:37:55] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: people complain about the smell not the sickyness
[18:38:25] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: It's like sauerkraut but made from soybeans
[18:38:30] <gildarts> KatrinValerie: heard of it, but haven't watched it. it is on my list. Here are some of the things that I've watched and liked. 
[18:38:34] <gildarts> Akame ga Kill!, Attack on Titan, Bleach, Brynhildr in the Darkness, Castlevania, Citrus, Fairy Tail, Fullmetal Alchemist- Brotherhood, Hunter x Hunter (2011), Neon Genesis Evangelion, No Game No Life, Sword Art Online, The God of High School, The Rising of the Shield Hero, Tokyo Ghoul, and Tower of God
[18:39:02] <KatrinValerie> gildarts: there are better shows for some of these
[18:39:07] <KatrinValerie> Bleach is horrible really
[18:39:07] <beaky> k-on forever
[18:39:25] <KatrinValerie> gildarts: for isekai I recommend things like overlord or slime
[18:39:36] <KatrinValerie> Better than Sword art online
[18:39:46] <beaky> konosuba is kawaii too
[18:39:48] <KatrinValerie> If you are okay with slow paced shows you can also watch .hack
[18:39:50] <amigojapan> gildarts: Eva is the only good anime in your list
[18:40:09] <gildarts> Oh, I admit there are some shows that are better. I've just liked those.
[18:40:10] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Maybe Hunter x Hunter as well
[18:40:15] <KatrinValerie> It's good for a shounen

[18:40:40] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Yes I know
[18:40:52] <gildarts> amigojapan: It was my introduction to anime as a young person. Not sure I would recommend that path to most people, but got me hooked.
[18:40:53] <KatrinValerie> That's why I say they are still good, you are biased against shounen in general
[18:41:04] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: for people that enjoy the genre FMA: Brotherhood is really good
[18:41:09] <KatrinValerie> And so is Hunter x Hunter
[18:41:22] <amigojapan> gildarts: let me show you my mal
[18:41:29] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I am dropping out of uni q.q
[18:41:42] <amigojapan> I heard KatrinValerie 
[18:41:42] <mixfix41> education is free
[18:41:52] <KatrinValerie> I cannot do it with my PTSD being so bad
[18:41:52] <mixfix41> so maybe dropping out of a scam..
[18:42:09] <KatrinValerie> mixfix41: I didn't pay any tuition fees
[18:42:18] <mixfix41> though the qualification is a good argument
[18:42:21] <KatrinValerie> Only payed for the train ticket and adminstrative fees
[18:42:35] <mixfix41> but also skills is also a good argument against qualification
[18:42:35] <KatrinValerie> I really want to complete my degree
[18:42:41] <KatrinValerie> but I just cannot do it right now
[18:42:50] <KatrinValerie> I probably need rehabilitation again
[18:43:01] <gildarts> Hunter x Hunter and Akame ga Kill! are probably my favorites on that list. Tower of God and The God of High School I mostly like because I read and liked the web comics.

[18:51:12] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: nein
[18:51:13] <mixfix41> which predictions do people listen to
[18:51:20] <KatrinValerie> It's also simply a myth
[18:51:24] <mixfix41> i hear more earthquakes are to be 
[18:51:27] <KatrinValerie> And can be read as a metaphor for change
[18:51:31] <mixfix41> thats pretty scary
[18:51:40] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: they don't believe in carbon dating either
[18:51:42] <KatrinValerie> Also, local flooding events could've inspired the story
[18:51:50] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: that's only extremists
[18:52:01] <KatrinValerie> Real scholars do not interpret the bible literal.
[18:52:02] <amigojapan> True KatrinValerie 
[18:52:12] <gildarts> Okay, yeah, those are the only things on that list that I've seen or hear of really.
[18:52:18] <gildarts> heard*
[18:52:19] <KatrinValerie> And theology is not as naive as people try to imply.
[18:52:39] <KatrinValerie> If you really argue about the existence of god with someone who studied theology you'll understand what I mean.
[18:52:41] <amigojapan> gildarts: not even nhk?
[18:52:43] <spoonm> !quote gildarts 
[18:52:43] <ImoutoBot> spoonm: gildarts has no quotes.
[18:52:58] <mixfix41> the ones that know the truth are taken seriously so thats why an old book is the topic
[18:52:58] <spoonm> amigojapan: interview didn't go very well, cause I'm unfamiliar with plenty of buzzwords that were thrown my way
[18:53:09] <gildarts> amigojapan: I guess I've heard of it, but haven't seen it.
[18:53:13] <KatrinValerie> The main point of theology is to extract reason from theologic texts and practises
[18:53:14] <spoonm> they did ask me to implement something while sharing my screen... and just as you guessed it was fizzbuzz lol
[18:53:26] <KatrinValerie> And to decide how to shape worship
[18:53:27] <amigojapan> Ouch spoonm :(
[18:53:55] <KatrinValerie> There are many arguing for faith sans church
[18:53:58] <amigojapan> gildarts: I think your list is too shounen
[18:54:20] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: And it is hard to argue that all humans have some form of faith
[18:54:28] <mixfix41> the church wont gain its past influence until it moves on a different presence and relevency something along those lines as mlk quote says
[18:54:35] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: they do
[18:54:38] <KatrinValerie> The only difference is what it's projected onto
[18:54:49] <KatrinValerie> And what social norms are infered from it
[18:54:57] <KatrinValerie> Religion can be both harmful and beneficial
[18:55:09] <KatrinValerie> but when it's organised in churches, it tends to become a mafia of sorts.
[18:55:09] <mixfix41> the preachers are more in the arts now
[18:55:16] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I have enough faith that aerodynamics holds that I get on planes
[18:55:34] <gildarts> That is fair. I will say that most of what I've liked is shounen. I prefer fantasy/sci-fi action stuff and really don't care for psychological plot lines. Not sure how to describe what I mean by that...
[18:55:38] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: In Germany the church is holding disabled people captured and forcing them to work.
[18:55:54] <KatrinValerie> And they call this helping
[18:56:15] <amigojapan> gildarts: try watching anime for girls for a change
[18:56:16] <KatrinValerie> All the generated income is taken away by the church, for giving them a place to stay at.
[18:56:23] <KatrinValerie> Whilst paying them way below minimum wage
[18:56:30] <KatrinValerie> It's terrifying
[18:56:55] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: Catholic church?
[18:56:57] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: the church needs helpless people, like mother theresa did before them, it's a cult
[18:57:02] <KatrinValerie> Yes catholics
[18:57:06] <KatrinValerie> They are the worst
[18:57:15] <KatrinValerie> They keep people dependent on help intentionally
[18:57:23] <KatrinValerie> They even intentionally make people sicker
[18:57:42] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Mother Theresa did the same with the people in her care.
[18:57:58] <gildarts> amigojapan: I'll try just about anything, no promises on sticking with something if I don't like it though.
[18:58:07] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: recently they have a science board and the Pope believes in evolution
[18:58:35] <lastonestanding> how can there be evolution within 6000 years?!
[18:58:42] <amigojapan> Ok gildarts let me think of a shoujo anime that is easy to like
[18:59:21] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: or does he mean evolution from now on?
[18:59:24] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: 6000k years is Jewish and protestants saying that
[18:59:46] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: not the Catholic church
[19:00:08] <lastonestanding> how old is the earth according to the Pope?
[19:00:39] <gildarts> Probably more of the same, but I've also liked Re-ZERO and The Asterisk War. There were others but having a hard time recalling titles.
[19:01:02] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: I think he probably believes what his science board tells him. They have actual astronomers
[19:01:05] <gildarts> Fruit Basket (Baskets?) is on my list to watch.
[19:01:43] <amigojapan> gildarts: that is shoujo
[19:02:16] <Poeticode> oooh I used to read Fruits Basket back in the day
[19:02:16] <gildarts> Not anime, but RWBY and gen-lock are good.

[21:37:48] <Sxem> looks like it is just for controllers, and theres a menu option to turn it off or on and 3 different strengths

[21:38:45] <Sxem> altho i wonder if you can plug in your controller to get aim assist, then use keyboard mouse for an unfair advantage

[23:22:39] <mexen> Docking feature where your windows layout is remember is quite nice even though I will not be using it 
[23:28:29] <mexen> I am, however, interested in the M1
[23:31:50] <MootPoot> a few features are cool for w11, I'll upgrade after its stable
[23:32:19] <MootPoot> but all the cool stuff I've already been doing normally through additions in w10
[23:32:23] <MootPoot> yeah the M1 is awesome
[23:32:51] <mexen> I did the check and my gaming laptop is w11 ready

[23:33:30] <mexen> MootPoot: me too, a lot of what I do on windows is pretty much already there on w10
[23:34:03] <mexen> I game on a Y540 and occasionally run Debian on WSL
[23:34:10] <mexen> So that's about all I do on it
[23:34:31] <MootPoot> its so nice being able to charge my macbook air from a car charger
[23:34:57] <mexen> My 5 year old Asus runs Mint and is what I use for irc, television, e-mail etc
[23:35:11] <mexen> MootPoot: you have an M1 Macbook Air?
[23:35:23] <mexen> I ordered the base model last week
[23:35:35] <MootPoot> I got it yesterday for work
[23:35:38] <MootPoot> I dont plan to keep it
[23:35:44] <MootPoot> just for like 2 months
[23:36:06] <MootPoot> if I do get it, I can get it cheaper from the apple store with university pricing
[23:36:07] <mexen> How much RAM? SSD capacity?
[23:36:09] <MootPoot> about 20-25% off
[23:36:18] <MootPoot> the normal cheapo model I think
[23:36:34] <theholyduck> i mean say waht yo uwill about apple but they make pretty nice laptops 
[23:36:35] <MootPoot> M1, 8gb ram, and I think 256 storage
[23:36:44] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  are you drunk
[23:36:49] <mexen> That's what I ordered for myself
[23:36:50] <theholyduck> sure they come at a price premium. but they also come at a quality premium
[23:37:39] <theholyduck> and similarly their phones last much longer than the competition
[23:37:45] <mexen> MootPoot: what kind of work will you be doing on it?
[23:37:46] <MootPoot> endurance sex
[23:38:02] <MootPoot> iOS dev
[23:38:04] *** senti_ is now known as sentionics
[23:38:18] <mexen> theholyduck: my lady has an 8 year old ipad that still runs like a dream
[23:38:42] <theholyduck> mexen: also yeah like the software support on old apple devices is just absurdly good
[23:38:57] <mexen> MootPoot: Nice, I plan to ssh into my linode, some vscode and O365 stuff
[23:39:23] <sentionics> Feeling a little better now. Though I kinda get these weird intermittent sensations like I'm being being hit by tiny droplets of water.
[23:39:32] <sentionics> Nal probably just being Nal.
[23:39:53] <mexen> She also has a base Macbook Pro from 2017 whose battery embarrasses the HP I got at work last year
[23:40:14] <theholyduck> but yeah like i have a 3 year old android phone
[23:40:25] <theholyduck> its still on android 10 and presuambly wont get 11 or 12
[23:40:38] <theholyduck> and i cant put lineage os on it either
[23:40:40] <theholyduck> as its locked down
[23:40:58] <theholyduck> if i had a 3 year old IPHONE on the other hand. id still be runnig the latest ios for years
[23:42:03] <mexen> Since 2017, I buy a new phone every year. I am actually considering getting an iPhone in a year or two
[23:42:47] <theholyduck> my usb-c port on my phone has become worn out anyway so i bought a new  phone that had the features i wanted and didnt the ones i didnt care baout :P 
[23:42:55] <mexen> Currently using a Xiaomi Redmi Note 9. It's quite comfy. Get's the job done.
[23:43:24] <Poeticode> i'm gonna be sad when i hafta upgrade to an iphone that doesn't have a button
[23:44:07] <theholyduck> ordered myself the new sony xperia 10 III in part because its brand new and has a formfactor i like. with a decent screen (if low refreshrate these days) + it comes with an upgrade to the wireless ANC headphones ive been using for 3 years aswelll 
[23:44:33] <mexen> Sweet!
[23:44:44] <theholyduck> sony is giving out wh-ch710ns to anyone who buys the new xperia 10 III before august. 
[23:44:51] <theholyduck> im pretty happy with my wh-ch700n
[23:44:57] <theholyduck> but they are sort of old and grimy now 
[23:45:05] <theholyduck> having lived on my head every day for 3 years 
[23:46:06] <theholyduck> they arent the best ANC headphones in the world. but they are light weight comfortable and not too expensive 
[23:47:27] <theholyduck> atleast the 700ns were. so i figured id give the 710ns a go aswell
[23:48:41] <MootPoot> wha
[23:48:45] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  where do you live
[23:48:52] <theholyduck> norway :P
[23:48:54] <MootPoot> ah
[23:49:07] <MootPoot> yeah sony stopped selling xperias here in NA for like
[23:49:07] <mexen> no way :P
[23:49:11] <MootPoot> 10 years now
[23:49:24] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i had a earlier xperia android phone that i didnt mind so much
[23:49:32] <theholyduck> ive been rocking a samsung s9+ for the least 3 years 
[23:49:38] <mexen> I only see Xperias in YouTube reviews
[23:49:57] <theholyduck> but as i said its not been getting updates to the os for a while
[23:50:10] <theholyduck> other than security
[23:50:22] <theholyduck> and its usb-c port is now mostly dead anyway
[23:50:30] *** Joins: volki57 (~volki57@95.70.134.1)
[23:51:40] <theholyduck> the xperia 10 III is definitly not the best allround phone at its price point. but im a pretty limited phone user anyway. i mostly use it to listen to audiobooks and podcasts
[23:52:07] <theholyduck> and i never use the camera
[23:52:11] <theholyduck> so i dont care the camera is pretty hsit
[23:52:12] <theholyduck> :D
