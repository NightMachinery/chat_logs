[03:54:17] <dragestil> but i suspect it has to do with xkb rather than i3
[03:54:22] <acdw> sounds like u got C-M-a bound to opening up a bunch of terminal windows in i3
[03:54:32] <acdw> you can see what happens when you type C-M-a with xev
[03:55:07] <dragestil> C-M-a is not in my i3 config
[03:55:34] <acdw> does it say anything in xev?
[03:55:48] <acdw> it's also possible another application is yoinking it out from under emacs's hands
[03:55:49] <dragestil> so I ran xev and then tryped C-M-a, xev does not say anything and a bunch of terminal windows get opened up
[03:56:06] <acdw> weird. are you using a funky keyboard?
[03:56:15] <dragestil> what is a funky keyboard
[03:56:16] <acdw> what terminal
[03:56:21] <acdw> like, aftermarket keyboard

[04:00:01] <acdw> oof
[04:00:07] <acdw> how many terminals are we talkin here?
[04:00:11] <dragestil> and switch to xev to kill it
[04:00:25] <dragestil> 4 terminal windows get opened by C-M-a
[04:00:41] <acdw> can you do something to make them open on like, another workspace or smothing?
[04:00:59] <dragestil> well, if i had a clue what C-M-a does...
[04:01:03] <acdw> like maybe xev on a workspace -> switch to another workspace -> c-m-a -> switch back
[04:01:13] <acdw> then you should be able to look at the second or third event from the bottom
[04:01:27] <dragestil> C-M-a seems to move all the terminal windows to one workspace, old and new
[04:01:34] <acdw> oh lord
[04:02:02] <acdw> okay how about thsi. i just tried on my computer, xev registers each key as you press it

[05:24:06] <mattf> I just got it customized like i wantsed

[05:24:17] <mattf> the vi mode is awesome if you are a vimmer
[05:24:18] <Spawns_Carpeting> alacritty is really nice. The true color support makes it look very nice
[05:24:34] <acdw> that's crazy! dragestil i use eshell ;)
[05:24:34] <dieggsy> on the off chance that any of you have been struggling with using rg as grep-command, you have to also (grep-apply-setting 'grep-use-null-device nil)
[05:24:35] <acdw> and vterm
[05:24:41] <acdw> but mostly eshell
[05:24:53] <dieggsy> I used to use eshell for almost everything, and I gave vterm a solid spin for a while
[05:25:05] <acdw> dieggsy: thanks for reminidng me to install rg :)
[05:25:21] <dieggsy> hell yeah
[05:25:28] <technomancy> I was using urxvt for everything but then I got stuck using wayland and it looks horrid here so I'm using xfce4-terminal like a chump
[05:25:30] <technomancy> but it's not very good
[05:25:36] <dragestil> acdw: eshell + tramp is too slow compared to ssh on a terminal emulator 
[05:25:41] <umaxtu> my one gripe with Alacritty so far is that I don't like yaml
[05:25:50] <dragestil> at least for me
[05:25:55] <technomancy> oh god they put yaml in a terminal? wtf
[05:26:02] <dieggsy> umaxtu: lol, but how often do you need to deal with it
[05:26:05] <dragestil> why do you need gpu accellaration. terminal emulator is not video player
[05:26:06] <dieggsy> technomancy: for the configuration file
[05:26:14] <technomancy> dieggsy: that's a tragedy
[05:26:42] <technomancy> I honestly have a hard time trusting anyone who thinks yaml is a good solution to any problem.
[05:26:47] <technomancy> (including my employer)
[05:26:58] <dieggsy> dragestil: it makes output go DAMN fast. is there a non-negligible efficiency increase? seriously doubtful. is it still cool? sure! lol
[05:27:18] <dragestil> ok
[05:27:18] <dieggsy> technomancy: jajaja, TBH, I completely understand
[05:27:33] <dragestil> guess i'll go with urxvt
[05:27:44] <dieggsy> dragestil: before alacritty yi used to use st, which is nice and simple
[05:27:46] <technomancy> the cool thing about urxvt is that you can open URLs without using the mouse
[05:27:54] <technomancy> I don't know any other term that can do that
[05:28:04] <dieggsy> technomancy: i think you can work that into tmux
[05:28:05] <acdw> dragestil: i mean ur right. i just used ssh to login ot my server :P
[05:28:12] <acdw> i think vterm can fix that tho
[05:28:18] <dieggsy> or at least, i used to have that configured in tmux. i wonder where it went
[05:28:30] <technomancy> dieggsy: not in this context; I have tmux running on the remote machine
[05:28:33] <acdw> speaking of, isnt there a command to make eshell drop a command into a vterm if it's in a certain list?
[05:28:35] <dragestil> ssh is the only thing that i can't get the workflow into emacs
[05:28:36] <acdw> or did i make that up
[05:28:45] <dragestil> because tramp is sooo slow
[05:28:54] <Spawns_Carpeting> I used urxvt for like 6 years on a daily basis until I switched to alacritty a few days ago
[05:28:55] <dieggsy> technomancy:? shouldn't it still be able to pick up URLs
[05:28:57] <Spawns_Carpeting> or a week ago or so
[05:28:58] <acdw> xterm is good
[05:29:02] <technomancy> dieggsy: sure, and do what with it?
[05:29:09] <technomancy> my remote tmux can't talk to my local browser
[05:29:12] <dieggsy> technomancy: i'm a goddamn idiot lmao

[05:31:45] <umaxtu> isnt it?
[05:32:08] <dieggsy> Spawns_Carpeting: that's a similar reason to why i didn't give kitty much of a chance. it  drew its own box characters instead of using my font's (and had no option for curved box characters at the time, or something). and the dev was like nah this is a feature. and well, that's totally fine. not my thing tho

[05:34:00] <dieggsy> i've never actually given it a try tho so
[05:34:05] <Spawns_Carpeting> I think some people bork their gentoo install and then file bugs to project maintainers, not the distros fault though
[05:34:06] <dragestil> urxvt is so ugly by default
[05:34:13] <dieggsy> acdw: ha. good to hear i'm not alone

[05:34:35] <dragestil> dieggsy: yeah i suppose
[05:34:49] <umaxtu> urxvt's font rendering felt off to me from what I remember
[05:34:55] <dieggsy> dragestil: it's like a few lines of configuration IIRC. i used urxvt way back
[05:35:35] <dieggsy> acdw: i think arch/void hit the sweet spot of not too much/just enough done for me
[05:35:50] <dieggsy> i'd try gentoo for shigs some time tho
[05:35:51] <technomancy> I've been using urxvt with terminus so I know its bitmap support is great
[05:36:13] <dragestil> dieggsy: a debian install without gui seems indistinguishable with an arch install for me

[08:05:21] <bpalmer> chasecaleb: why can't the macro handle evaluating its argument?
[08:05:42] <twb> is that not in frame properties?
[08:06:05] <chasecaleb> bpalmer because I'm trying to use `transient-define-infix`, which quotes the argument. See here, I promise it's short - https://pastebin.com/4u9teqYv

[08:06:48] <bpalmer> chasecaleb: in the normal course of things, this couldn't be done outside of the macro because macros are expanded before runtime (at macroexpansion time, which may be at compile time). That said, you can certainly bypass the normal order using things like eval
[08:07:06] <twb> (frame-parameters) has display parameter
[08:07:18] <twb> Which on *old* X would be e.g. ":0.17" for the 17th display
[08:07:29] <bpalmer> chasecaleb: some macros are written more flexibly than others so they can see, for example, that they're being handed an expression to be evaluated rather than a literal
[08:07:50] <twb> (font . "-MS  -Consolas-normal-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1")
[08:07:54] <twb> ...weird whitespace there
[08:09:20] <bpalmer> chasecaleb: in some cases, you may also be able to use some eval-when-compile to prepare stuff that you hand to the macro form
[08:10:23] <chasecaleb> bpalmer hmm, maybe eval-when-compile might work. the macro body basically has `(defalias ',name-arg 'foo), and I'm trying to figure out how to work around the single quote in front of name-arg.
[08:10:26] <bpalmer> at any rate. Perhaps akater[m]'s advice to look at --iterate would benefit you; I haven't looked at that before.

[08:12:44] <bpalmer> chasecaleb: but the crude way that will just work is simply to use eval so you can compute parts of the macro form at runtime, and then evaluate the whole thing.
[08:13:00] <twb> Hang on this doesn't make sense.  In *at least* wayland and windows, an emacs frame can span multiple physical LCDs.  "what display is it on?" would have to be "what displays is it on?"
[08:13:11] <bpalmer> Technically you'll have to make sure that the macro definition is available at runtime as well, but I suspect transient doesn't separate its macros from its functions.
[08:14:32] <bpalmer> what displays, if any, is it on?   , probably, to handle virtual desktops
[08:15:09] <chasecaleb> bpalmer Hmm. I kinda get what you're saying but I'm not sure where I would put eval/eval-when-compile in this case. Do you have a sec to look at this minimal pastebin I made (or did you already)? https://pastebin.com/4u9teqYv
[08:16:03] <akater[m]> I was thinking chasecaleb wanted to evaluate an argument of their own macro.  That's what many of `dash` macros do, and `--iterate` is short.
[08:16:54] <chasecaleb> akater[m] yeah... unfortunately I'm the caller of the macro in this case, not the implementer.
[08:19:08] <chasecaleb> I kind of suspect that what I'm asking can't be done and I need to just make my own altered version of transient-define-infix... I just don't want to go down that road unnecessarily though because maintenance.

[08:20:25] <akater[m]> chasecaleb: The problem is of course suspicious.  If the macro does not evaluate the argument, then it's like trying to evaluate x in (let ((x x0)) ..)  You likely simply need to use a differet function.

[08:23:55] <bpalmer> The `(... ,(...)) has the comma bits evaluated at run-time; then eval forces macroexpansion and evaluation with the new form.

But pressing M-x TAB doesn't show my--foo even in emacs-lisp-mode.  How would I best debug this?  I'd have expected the command to be filtered out.

[11:13:28] <humasect> helm 
[11:13:30] <humasect> ?
[11:13:32] <bpalmer> how do you change the list of modes it should be active in, to add or remove them?
[11:14:34] <ext0l> using the (interactive) syntax, or by setting the 'completion-predicate property on the symbol
[11:14:51] <bpalmer> (it is doable by grubbing into the internals of interactive, but they could just as easily have done it with a symbol in the property directly)
[11:15:02] <ext0l> or writing your own function for read-extended-command-predicate that does whatever you want

[11:17:14] <ext0l> the default behavior is that 'completion-predicate overrides the (interactive) stuff, and you can get the list of modes via command-modes, so you can do stuff that way
[11:19:37] <bpalmer> My primary initial complaint is that it's shoved into interactive and particularly with &rest, when (a) it doesn't particularly seem to fit interactive, imo; and (b) making it &rest cuts off adding *other* extensions to interactive, unless they (c) revise it to use keywords, which then means interactive's spec will be even more complicated.
[11:19:59] <bpalmer> but as I just found out about it, I'll let it rattle in my head some more.
[11:20:36] <ext0l> yeah, i have no particular opinion on it being put in interactive. i do think it's a very valuable thing to exist, thougn
[11:20:41] <bpalmer> (somewhere there's a nice rant about this in python, about the annoyance of making library functions accept *args (which are like elisp's &rest), as opposed to just taking a list.

[11:21:29] <bpalmer> (interactive "P" '(haskell-mode lisp-mode)),for example, means you can just keep adding parameters in.

[12:55:05] *** Quits: razzy (~razzy@user/razzy) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[12:55:19] <rgr> you could wrap that function call with an override I guess that creates a new version of that var and then pops the old one back.
[12:55:21] <bpalmer> you could advise the function so that , after it's run, it immediately evaluates your code, which sets the variable to whatever value you want.
[12:55:33] <susam> Reminds me of an international convention several years back where each country's representative were supposed to do a "welcome cheer" in their country's language. When it came to India, the confusion was to decide which one of the 100s or possibly 1000s of Indian languages to pick for the "welcome cheer".
[12:55:33] <bpalmer> you could also use ,,elpatch

[13:53:08] <kilobug> roadie: « apt install znc » on debian-based distro, something equivalent in others
[13:53:11] <susam> roadie: I use a Debian Linux system on a Linode virtual private server. apt-get install znc. Followed by some configuration to make it connect to Libera IRC.
[13:53:56] <roadie> I am on this slick glitzi macos...
[13:54:20] <roadie> I have brew though
[13:54:26] <susam> roadie: The config is pretty straightforward. I think if you just type 'znc' and start it for the first time, it walks you through the config.
[13:54:56] <susam> roadie: I doubt ZNC on your macOS would be useful. You would close your Macbook and step away, right? That's not the type of use case ZNC addresses.

[13:55:51] <susam> roadie: And then you use your macOS/ERC to connect to ZNC whenever you are at your keyboard. At other times, you close your macOS, step away. But ZNC keeps your nick alive in the network. ZNC becomes a proxy for your client.
[13:56:19] <roadie> thank you susam - installing 
[13:56:59] <susam> roadie: ERC, irssi, etc. ---> ZNC ---> Libera IRC. The first ---> may break and shutdown as you please. The second ---> should be a reliable 24x7 connection.

[14:00:26] * roadie is doing the znc config
[14:00:50] <kilobug> roadie: yes sure, just be sure to point your erc (or whatever) to the right port, and ensure it's open on any firewall that might be between your client and the znc
[14:01:25] <rudi> roadie: just making sure - you're not installing znc on your laptop?  Because that won't work
[14:01:41] <roadie> it won't? 
[14:02:04] <susam> roadie: It won't. See my previous message. But you can go ahead with the complete config once, so that you get a good idea of what ZNC is.
[14:02:11] <rudi> no, if your laptop's IP address changes because of VPN, znc will get kicked just as your irc client gets kicked now
[14:02:17] <kilobug> rudi: well, that will work with the "handling sasl that the client doesn't know how to do" issue, but not with the "keep the connection to IRC alive when the laptop is asleep"
[14:02:18] <susam> roadie: You can then later setup ZNC on an independent system that is always connected to the Internet.
[14:02:22] <roadie> its always on, lid open, connected and when I take it out I can shut down znc?
[14:02:48] <susam> roadie: If your laptop is always on, why do you need ZNC? Why can't you just run ERC itself on it?
[14:02:55] <roadie> or does it hate dynamic addresses 
[14:03:25] <rudi> TCP hates dynamic addresses

[14:03:34] <MysteriousSilver> hmm
[14:03:54] <roadie> so maybe I don't need it
[14:03:58] <xristos> roadie: if you want persistent IRC connection regardless of if your laptop is on or off, you need to setup a bouncer to a server that runs 24/7 or use something like irccloud.com
[14:03:59] <susam> roadie: So wouldn't your ZNC get disconnected too randomly if you install ZNC on your laptop?
[14:04:11] <roadie> good point

[14:05:23] <susam> roadie: Regardless, no harm in trying it out once locally even though it may not serve a purpose. A first-hand experience with ZNC would be more valuable than all our descriptions and characterizations of ZNC.
[14:05:48] <susam> Once you have a first-hand feel of ZNC, you would automatically realize that you want to set up ZNC on a server that runs 24x7.

[16:40:02] <backleet> alphapapa[m]: that's one way to look at it, what font family/size do you use? Sometimes I want to go back to vim for the simplicity of it, but it's easier to make IDE out of Emacs than Vim imo. In vim you have to hack around a lot I think to do things, in Emacs a lot of stuff sort of plugs in together
[16:40:15] <backleet> TheInformaticist: as always
[16:40:18] <alphapapa[m]> TheInformaticist: Man I just put something together that I've been thinking about for like a year, it finally came together in my mind, and it's going to be so useful in my Elisp packages
[16:40:38] <TheInformaticist> 'M-x windmove-default-keybindings'. Gotta love it.
[16:40:38] <alphapapa[m]> backleet: I use the font "Hack" at a height of 90
[16:41:09] <backleet> alphapapa[m]: nice, I am gonna try it, I suppose 90 is small (maybe depends on dpi or something)
[16:41:11] <TheInformaticist> alphapapa[m]: That's really cool.
[16:41:24] <alphapapa[m]> backleet: It definitely depends on DPI
[16:42:10] <backleet> alphapapa[m]: let me ask you something else, do you use doom modeline, do you have fragmented modal icon sometimes when changing it?

[17:43:01] <lisp123> in and he could implement ten times as fast as I could, partly because he knew TECO inside out.
[17:43:01] <lisp123> So I worked seriously on the implementation of Emacs probably for only about four or six weeks. At which point it became clear that Stallman understood what the program was. I wanted to get back to doing graduate- student things. So Stallman did the other 99.999 percent of the work. But I played a role in catalyzing it and beginning the implementation.
[17:43:15] <hodapp> vampire: 'stable' how? 
[17:43:29] <lisp123> Emacs came from TECO, and was basically RMS mostly, with contributions from everyone else (everybody wrote their own macros & packages etc)

[17:45:14] <vampire> Digital just locks up, where as analog would just jam up..
[17:45:48] <TheInformaticist> vampire You should read what Hamming says about the Digital Revolution in his last book.
[17:46:04] <TheInformaticist> He also wrote a book about digital filters.
[17:46:05] <hodapp> vampire: how does it "lock up"?
[17:46:17] <vampire> To me it is just one of those forks that has not been scientifically been explored much.
[17:46:54] <TheInformaticist> Hmmm...
[17:47:20] <vampire> I look at it all as an electron flow. Programming is nothing more than electron flow of pre defined terms of operations in a digital spectrum based on a oscillating silicon chip.
[17:47:22] <hodapp> vampire: not been scientifically explored much? prior to digital, it was the de facto means of computing anything even slightly complicated from things like differential equations
[17:48:12] <hodapp> they didn't switch to digital because it was new and shiny, they switched to digital because analog computing is full of pitfalls that make it very difficult and with very few benefits
[17:48:24] <TheInformaticist> We wouldn't be doing this right now if not for digital. Why? Noise.
[17:48:28] <vampire> hodapp the battleships of ww2 have the most advanced analog computers on earth and are more accurate than digital ones.  Believe it or not..

[17:54:15] <grym> vampire: yes and?
[17:54:51] <hodapp> vampire: Also, you seem to be assuming a dichotomy between 'digital' and 'analog' that is completely incorrect. "Digital" electronics are literally just a specific interpretation of electronics that are fundamentally still analog.
[17:55:22] <grym> we just lie to ourselves and claim it's a rectwin

[20:15:01] <acdw> however, vterm can handle those bad boys --- so like, is there some way to have eshell inspec tthe command run, and if it matches a regex or a list or smth, drop it into vterm?

[20:53:37] <acdw> fnstudio: yes. historically, Meta keys were accessed by hitting escape and then the key
[20:53:51] <acdw> then the Alt key came along, and you could hold it down and type the key and it sends the same code to the terminal
[20:54:04] <acdw> so functionally, Alt+x is the same as Escape, x
[20:54:15] <fnstudio> acdw: ah very interesting, that makes sense
[20:54:16] <acdw> a terminal sees the same keycode for both of those
[20:54:25] <acdw> sure!
[20:54:33] <fnstudio> thanks!
[20:54:37] <acdw> the history of terminals and keyboards is very interesting, highly recommend looking into it
[20:54:41] <infandum> Nevermind, got it. I needed the tramp-remote-path changed in the tramp--startup-hook which I had trouble finding the hook for.
[20:55:16] <acdw> i.e., C-i == TAB because Control adds a high bit to the keycode, and i in ASCII is the same as TAB but with that one bit set
[20:55:22] <acdw> or something like that
[20:55:37] <acdw> same with C-h = DEL, etc.

[20:56:59] <fnstudio> very fascinating

[21:59:27] <Mentat> alphapapa[m]: I have a question for you. Why can't I just replace agendas with org-ql views?
[21:59:37] <acdw> also the issue isn't that "we’re" is misspelled, it's that only "re" is,,, meaning that "we’re" isn't even seen as a word
[22:00:16] <acdw> hmmm this might be emacs-level... M-f/b on we're goes to spaces, whereas on we’re it stops at the apostrophe
[22:00:30] <acdw> so now... how do i change how emacs splits words? 
[22:00:32] <acdw> that's the qestion!
[22:00:33] <alphapapa[m]> Mentat: If org-ql-views do everything you need, then I guess you can.  But they don't have all of Org Agenda's features...maybe someday...
[22:01:14] <Mentat> I'm having a hard time figuring out what exactly those limitations are.
[22:01:14] <cvandusen> As jlf said, it's not an apostrophe.
[22:01:38] <Mentat> Plus what exactly it is that org-super-agenda does that org-ql-block wouldn't do
[22:02:30] <acdw> cvandusen: jlf: there's not a "right curly apostrophe" in unicode afaict
[22:02:32] <Mentat> I will say that I love org-ql. It's awesome. I'm just setting up a more complicated agenda view system for work and was evaluating my options from your other packages.
[22:02:34] <alphapapa[m]> Mentat: Please see the org-super-agenda FAQ
[22:03:01] <acdw> hm. i see what yall are saying.
[22:03:03] <acdw> hmmmm

[22:04:54] <Mentat> Hmm. I read that yesterday, but for some reason it didn't click. So basically I could write a large query that collects everything for the view, then group in with O-S-A instead of writing small queries and using org-agenda-custom-commands with base org-agenda?

[22:06:20] <Mentat> Awesome. No idea why that didn't settle in until someone said RTFM
[22:06:27] <alphapapa[m]> Mentat: But using org-ql-block does offer an extra ability: the ability to show multiple, independent queries in a single buffer.  org-ql-view doesn't yet allow that.
[22:07:13] <alphapapa[m]> Mentat: Don't feel bad, it can be hard to understand how all these pieces fit together.  Sometimes even I get confused.  :)
[22:07:23] <Mentat> Couldn't you get that by just (or query1 query2) and grouping with SA?
[22:07:45] <Mentat> Oh wait you said with ql-view
[22:07:46] <acdw> girzel[m]: oooh neat. tho i don't think emacs is sending "we’re" to aspell in the first place, otherwise it'd see the whole word as wrong. it just says the "re" is wrong
