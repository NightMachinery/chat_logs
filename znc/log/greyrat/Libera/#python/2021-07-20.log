[02:05:39] <winterflaw> the main culprit, as far as I understand it, are store buffers and cache invalidation requests

[02:32:24] <Yhg1s> winterflaw: keep in mind that even if the data structures are lock-free, they're still Python objects, so you still need to hold the GIL in order to touch them.

[02:40:10] <winterflaw> the basic problem with ref-counting GC, if you want to be fully parallel, is that you may just be able to ref an object when someone else deallocates it already

[02:49:20] <bjs> individual locks for the former makes too much existing code slower (because e.g. for not very concurrent programs you spend a lot of time just taking and releasing locks for no reason) and the latter is just a hard problem in general to do without locks

[02:51:32] <winterflaw> atomic op to inc/dec, and then that count hits zero, the ref-count codes submits the allocation to the lock-free GC for actual deallocation

[07:05:18] <puff> SnoopJ: Thanks. No, not over network, just locally.  I have a python script that gets higher level (more abstract) commands via network and then uses vlc to play a video. I'm looknig at moving to mpv because when I play vlc in fullscreen mode on a raspberry pi, either via the GUI or via the python script, I get a black screen. The mouse pointer appears if I move it around, but no video.

[07:06:39] <puff> Yeah, I've been banging my head against a brick wall.
[07:06:58] <puff> I got it working on the pi 4 a few months ago, but couldn't repeat it when buildnig from scratch.
[07:07:57] <puff> TWo months go I got a pi compute module 4 w/EMMC and IO board, couldn't get vlc working in fullscreen, set it aside, came back to it a month later and it miraculously worked.  But I still can't figure out wtf changed to make it work.  Rebuilt it from scratch, not working in fullscreen.

[07:24:24] <SnoopJ> puff, this is one of those things where Debian thinks they know what does or doesn't belong in Python, you need the `wheel` module. It's provided by the python3-wheel package, or you can `python3 -m pip install wheel` to get the most recent version
[07:25:35] <SnoopJ> puff, but after consideration I think python-mpv will be a nicer experience anyway, it has more directly-useful functions for your task.

[14:48:26] <Yhg1s> but you can use the virtualenvs tox created however you can use any virtualenv, sure.
[14:48:47] <Luyin> ok so when I run tox, it creates a new virtenv and runs tests etc in there. so far so good
[14:49:26] <Luyin> but if I want to install a package and use it, I don't do something like "tox install pydocstyle", I install it via "pip install pydocstyle". and when I don't do that in a virtenv, it'll be installed systemwide. Which I don't want.
[14:49:45] <Luyin> and when I want tox to also use this package, I'll add it in pyproject.toml
[14:49:51] <Luyin> correct so far?
[14:50:19] <Yhg1s> Luyin: sure, I guess? I'm not sure what part of that was in doubt.
[14:50:33] <Yhg1s> Luyin: tox isn't a replacement for creating a virtualenv for a thing you want to use outside of testing, really.

[15:27:38] <p-i-_> Suppose I have a dictionary of price-shelves: {price: amount}. I need to add/removee shelves and get the shelf-number of a given price.
[15:27:44] <p-i-_> What's a good object primitive for this?
[15:28:10] <drvanon> If I have a iterator of dictionaries and I want to create two iterators from two different keys in the dictionary, how can I do this smartly? Right now I just consume the whole iterator for the first property and then the generator is empty for the second property. https://gist.github.com/Drvanon/c103f260117f0cda9b1786d5fc920fad

[15:28:52] <p-i-_> e.g. I have { 1.1: 120, 1.4: 666, 1.7: 33 } and I may wish to add 1.2: 42, now I will have { 1.1: 120, 1.2: 42, 1.4: 666, 1.7: 33 }
[15:29:32] <p-i-_> And the shelf number for price 1.1 is 0, and for price 1.7 is now 3.
[15:30:52] <drvanon> Would something like {'shelf-id': {'amount': amount, 'price': price}} not be a more clear kind of way to work with this? Not super clear on what you are trying to do, but that is how I would approach it.

[17:14:28] <rendar> let's say i have a start date and an end date, i want N grid lines into that range, so i divide (end-start)/N, but what is the most effective way to align that timedelta to some human readable time span? e.g. 1 month, 2 months, 1 quarter, 0.5 years, 1 year
[17:14:30] <rendar> ?
[17:15:55] <dba> Luyin, it is a query (json format) but when I receive it I receive it as string, for easy parsing/getting the key I want to convert it to dict
[17:17:08] <Luyin> dba: sorry, it was loads not reads: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html, search "Decoding JSON"
[17:17:21] <Luyin> it turns it into a dict for you
[17:17:37] <Luyin> or rather, either a list or a dict, depending on the json coming as a string
[17:17:39] <entuland> rendar, are you using some library that helps you actually handling the dates and spans? you may not want to mess with week days, months durations and so forth yourself
[17:18:08] <rendar> i'm not using it

[18:35:18] <nubonix> altendky: not sure what you mean by that. currently when i press the start button on the gui, it starts a qthread, and this thread is supposed to start a job within the scheduler, as all jobs are paused by my default setting
[18:36:08] <nubonix> altendky: it has to do with qasync, and since asyncioscheduler needs async, i left it there, as i dont fully understand what the code does [hasattr/getattr]
[18:36:15] <altendky> nubonix: having print statements in the code and output from them helps to share what is happening.  then you generally either point out a print out that you think shouldn't happen, or one that should but doesn't, to help quickly understand the relevant code path.

[18:43:39] <altendky> nubonix: no, i wanted you to delete irrelevant code so that the relevant code was obvious.  first to you.  then if you still can't figure it out, it will be good for others to help as well.  http://sscce.org/ is one of the references for this procedure.

[18:44:41] <altendky> nubonix: but either way, when you delete some code you think is not relevant you should then run the code you have left and confirm it still exhibits the same issue you are trying to debug.  and you keep deleting code until there's nothing left to delete and but your issue is still present.

[18:47:31] <altendky> i certainly didn't do any rigorous poking and my brain was a bit not-so-great by that time of night.
[18:48:33] <nubonix> altendky: you are right, i probably dont need threads, but i need some sort of concurrency, as there are sets of tasks that run independently from each other, and these tasks need to be started via a button, and stopped via another button.
[18:48:52] <nubonix> independently and at the same time

[18:49:33] <nubonix> altendky: yes i understand, you were having me reduce code to make it easier on myself and everyone involved to help
[18:50:17] <altendky> but yeah, using both qasync and threads ought generally only be done if you really have a blocking api you need to use.  and even then, you would generally want to bury it behind the async/await threading features, not qt threads.

But does anyone know what this is any why I need to limit the threads? Why does openBLAS even use multithreading when I am controlling my own program with

[19:23:01] <octav1a> Isn't it inefficient, If I wrote a program and run it on a 12 core system, and use 12 processes, and then numpy is using more threads by itself, there will be thrashing?

[19:23:39] <SnoopJ> if you write your program in a way that doesn't use that threading to your advantage, it will be very inefficient, yes.
[19:25:06] <octav1a> I design programs so that all of the workers use as close to 100% cpu as possible, I didn't imagine more threading behind the scenes. Should I be finding numpy's thread count somewhere and always setting it to 1 for multiprocess programs?
[19:25:25] <SnoopJ> ideally you'd let numpy do what it's good at and not rewrite those parts
[19:25:47] <SnoopJ> but instead write your application to take advantage of numpy being very very good at parallelizing idiomatic operations

[19:38:06] <SnoopJ> paule32, what's going wrong with it? One thing that jumps out to me is that e.g. "\:" probably doesn't do what you think it does: that is a two-character string, a literal backslash and a colon.
[19:38:22] <altendky> SnoopJ: hah, i forgot to reinitialize the iteration values at each layer of the `__mro__` so i like walked through attributes `[0:3]` or whatever at the first layer, then `[3:10]` at the next and so on...  https://gist.github.com/altendky/4c58ce4dd5e1b41afd2c98576c76c0d7#file-x-cpp-L15-L17 were outside the outer while
[19:40:01] <altendky> i'm sure this is wrong, but it does at least trivially resolve the `True` vs. `False` output
[19:40:18] <SnoopJ> altendky, at the risk of tut-tutting, I'd probably use the names `base_mro, base_mro_it` and maybe change `item` too to keep the two iterations straight in my head :P
[19:40:34] <SnoopJ> but a simple fix is always nice
[19:41:34] <altendky> SnoopJ: yeah, this is garbage right now.  i'll remove all my debugging and then see how many tests this breaks.  also i need to try it on their `dev` branch which didn't want to build last night for me (i worked on the latest tag instead).

[22:31:09] <nubonix> this is where i need self.qtscheduler https://gist.github.com/nubonics/eda07e95acdc32c1cc73ec9aed169836#file-homepage-py-L492
[22:31:09] <nubonix> and im instantiating self.qtscheduler in app.py here https://gist.github.com/nubonics/eda07e95acdc32c1cc73ec9aed169836#file-app-py-L49
[22:31:09] <nubonix> also, im not sure if this is thread-safe `self.qtscheduler.job.Job.resume_job(job_id=job_id)`, but i need to run this concurrently if possible
[22:31:47] <AhmedAmerican> what could that be related to ? https://bpa.st/MD7A this value is generated each time for an XHR request to API within Chinese website. is it possible to decode it ? looks like it's HTML text decoder AFAIK https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder

[23:47:59] <nubonix> ye u r, or at least i see asyncio.create_task
[23:48:01] <Payam> a task? gather does it right?
[23:48:08] *** Joins: zeden (~zeden@user/zeden)
[23:48:09] <nubonix> gather runs the tasks all at the same time
[23:48:28] <Payam> so I need to create task first and then run gather?
[23:48:30] <nubonix> pre sure create_future doesnt actually start the task
[23:48:35] <nubonix> yes
