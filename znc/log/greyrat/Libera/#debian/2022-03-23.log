[02:23:50] <wez> HelloShitty: The man page details this :)
[02:24:13] <wez> Do you really need to specify the ssh command to run?
[02:24:18] <HelloShitty> what about the ::module part?
[02:24:27] <wez> what's that module?
[02:24:35] <HelloShitty> yes, otherwise how am I going to connect to the device?
[02:24:42] <HelloShitty> it's in the command
[02:24:52] <HelloShitty> ...host::module
[02:25:25] <HelloShitty> and where do I specify the origin of the data to be copied?

[02:28:27] <Khepra> there's also ~/.ssh/config  if you frequently need to write anything other than  `ssh hostname`

[02:29:57] <sney> HelloShitty: ok, here's a secret- every time I use rsync, after not using it for a few weeks, the command I know from memory is "man rsync"
[02:30:35] <HelloShitty> I am on the man page, but it shows me more new things that I don't know per every line I read... :|

[03:51:43] <sney> ventoy is a good tool too, if you have more than one iso and you don't need to keep overwriting the same usb drive.
[03:51:44] <sney> !ventoy
[03:51:44] <dpkg> Ventoy is an open-source utility to facilitate booting .iso images from USB storage. It installs grub to the USB, and then uses grub to select among multiple .iso images on the USB.  https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventoy

[06:18:25] <devfx11> nothing
[06:18:30] <devfx11> debian is great :)

[06:20:09] <sney> it is in the package information fields, uname -a output, and visible on tracker.debian.org as well. did you look there first before complaining?
[06:20:39] <devfx11> uname -a give you not the right thing
[06:20:54] <sney> Linux debaser 5.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 5.16.12-1 (2022-03-08) x86_64 GNU/Linux
[06:21:00] <sney> hmm, looks like it has both to me

[06:21:42] <devfx11> ehh
[06:21:45] <devfx11> why different ?

[06:23:02] <devfx11> just asking
[06:23:10] <devfx11> why not have the same ?
[06:23:31] <devfx11> so deb 5.16.0-4-amd64 = 5.16.12-1
[06:23:33] <sney> iirc it has to do with indicating ABI compatibility
[06:23:43] <devfx11> so why not be deb 5.16.12.1
[06:23:45] <devfx11> so why not be deb 5.16.12-1
[06:23:57] <kee> Also, what if they have to downgrade the kernel patch version, for whatever reason?
[06:24:11] <devfx11> ehh
[06:24:13] <devfx11> i dont care
[06:24:21] <sney> so e.g. 5.16.0-3 and 5.16.0-4 are ABI compatible, external modules don't need to be rebuilt, and that's not as obvious when it's the upstream version

[12:32:15] <somiaj> Heston: many do, and just because the non-free firmware is on the chip, doesn't mean they don't need it. Though there is a very select few you can flash free firmware on
[12:32:44] <somiaj> Personally I'm a fan of firmware being loaded in the kernel vs on the chip, flashing chips for bugfixes sucks
[12:33:22] <Heston> well sure but we're talking about needing the non-free repos
[12:33:38] <Heston> you're not escaping firmware any time soon
[12:34:11] <somiaj> Yea, It is nice that debian makes it clear firmware is non-free, but unless you buy very limited hardware, then flash it free firmware, you will have to deal with non-free firmware in some way

[12:36:08] <somiaj> It is more there is some hardware you can flash free firmware on, but it comes with non-free firmware. There are some known librea machines, though they maybe a bit old now
[12:36:15] <somiaj> though it is often very expensive
[12:37:47] <somiaj> though I keep getting older, this hardware may not be called modern anymore
[12:41:59] <Heston> yeah I've heard of those but I don't believe any of them are entirely open source
[12:43:03] <Heston> certainly not any gpus and most open cpus are a work in progress/hardly modern

[16:57:26] <Khepra> However, when the upstream ESR expires, there may be lags in Debian's switch to next ESR. For the current ESR, it required new Rust in Bullseye, so teh policy had to be..... massaged....

[18:45:52] <kerio> alkisg: you were right about reprepro, the includedeb directive doesn't really look at the file name (other than requiring a .deb extension), so whatever name is totally fine, it'll get copied into the correct debian-ish name in the pool directory - thanks again!

[21:01:26] <devfx11> so hard-links are a no go on zfs ?
[21:02:59] <devfx11> then im not going to use rsnapshot, just as you said rsync and snapshots on the zfs side :)

[21:06:42] <Khepra> devfx11: yes becuse those hardlinks aren't reflinks, which zfs can't do outside of literally making a snap
[21:07:36] <Khepra> so you have overhead for no gains; instead, if you don't want to use send|receive, or you use different filesystems, look into usin rsync based off of snapshot directories. yo don't need a hardlink-recursive tools like rsnapshot for that tho
[21:09:21] <Khepra> (which, if you want, you can of course still use, it works.   I'm just saying it's inefficient with zfs)

[22:08:14] <[sr]> hi guys, how can i limit memory usage for clamd? it's using systemd, and i inserted on /lib/systemd/system/clamav-daemon.service MemoryLimit=512M under [service] section but the service doesn't start with that options
[22:08:19] <[sr]> what am i doing wrong?
[22:09:03] <Khepra> [sr]: for starters you're editing files under  /lib/systemd/  instead of using drop-ins or entire .service override in /etc
[22:09:55] <[sr]> hum, where should i look for, for this option?
[22:10:28] <[sr]> there's no clamd.conf in /etc/default
[22:11:12] <Khepra> [sr]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd#Editing_provided_units
[22:11:35] <somiaj> [sr]: It is just how systemd works, files in /etc/systemd override files in /lib/systemd, though you can also provide a snippit file which only includes changes (that way you get upstream changes when the package is upgraded)
[22:12:13] *** Joins: luuuciano (~luuuciano@user/luuuciano)
[22:12:39] <Khepra> [sr]: also, use MemoryMax= instead of MemoryLimit which has been deprecated, don't remember when, so it's possible systemd isn't respecting the setting
[22:13:38] <[sr]> ok /etc/systemd, so i can create a clamd.conf with that parameter right?
[22:14:02] <Khepra> that said, if you limit a service process, it won't automagically work under less RAM. if clamd would need more RAM than allocated, it won't do its job correctly
[22:14:38] <Khepra> [sr]: yes, you can only list that one entry, but it has to be also with appropriate [Section] , in this case [Service]
[22:14:39] *** Quits: badsektor (~badsektor@user/badsektor) (Quit: Leaving...)

[22:17:07] <Khepra> yeah

[22:18:57] <Khepra> no that's wrong directory
[22:19:16] <Khepra> if you want to override entire .service unit, you need to copy it to /etc/systemd/system/ and modify there.
