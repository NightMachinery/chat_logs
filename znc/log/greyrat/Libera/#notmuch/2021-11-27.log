[16:02:45] <gour> i'd like to use notmuch instead of mu with neomutt, and wonder what would be the notmuch equivalent for: set query_command = "mu cfind --format=mutt-ab '%s'" ?

[18:05:59] <bremner> gour: I don't know what that does, but neomutt has notmuch virtual folders built in. It doesn't call the notmuch command
[18:08:22] <gour> bremner: the above cmd. does query for email addresses collected, instead of using some external addressbook.
[18:15:10] <bremner> ah, notmuch address exists, but I don't know about neomutt integration
[18:16:08] <bremner> The format is pretty simple, maybe someone has already made it work

[19:35:52] <gour> ok, will take a look, bremner

[20:46:47] <gour> thank you!

[22:32:58] <bremner> gour: seemingly nobody had time to work on it. I guess the author is OK with their own project?
[22:34:36] <gour> i see
[22:41:58] <bremner> Needs a c programmer, which is apparently a rare skill
