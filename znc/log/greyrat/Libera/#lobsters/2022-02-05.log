[18:51:31] <epilys> are the image files too big for storing them in the git repo?
[18:51:41] <epilys> you can auto compress them to webp or sth
[18:52:05] <riv> I could store them in the repo, this would be nice because it would give versioning
[18:52:17] <albertito> riv: yeah, a simple cgi would do the trick for file upload, if you're ok with the hassle. And it can even compress it automatically, etc.
