[19:12:38] <greyrat> How can I write a family tree in org-mode?

[19:24:17] <Demosthenex> greyrat: that'd end up scaling too big i think. this is where linking may be more appropriate than a hierarchy
[19:24:41] <Demosthenex> alternatively, maybe just make children in the hierarchy of the mothers, and list the father as a property linking to his heading?

[19:36:10] <greyrat> That's really unnatural.
[19:37:13] <greyrat> I am fine with some occasional links to preserve the tree structure (i.e., to cutany loops in the graph), but linking all father relationships will make inspecting this tree manually very difficult.
[19:39:29] <Demosthenex> greyrat: what you're describing is a graph database. of course an outline with individual headings can't have to datatypes
[19:39:48] <Demosthenex> org isn't really a database tool either
[19:41:11] <pjb> greyrat: note that family trees are not trees. They're DAG (until we find a time machine).
[19:41:25] <pjb> So it's actually a tad more complex than just having two parents…
[19:41:53] <pjb> greyrat: use lisp to store your graph datastructure…
[19:45:32] <pjb> greyrat: there's already some graph editors in emacs: eg. cogre: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ConnectedGraphEditor
[19:46:07] <pjb> http://cedet.sourceforge.net/cogre.jpg
[19:46:51] <pjb> Perhaps some updating will be needed, apparently, it hasn't been tested beyond emacs-24.
[19:50:56] <Demosthenex> its funny too the problems that programmers have had with family trees.

[19:51:13] <Demosthenex> assuming one mother and one father. or presuming it's a one way DAG that makes sense ;]
[19:57:11] <greyrat> The DAG can be turned into a tree with some minial pruning, I think. But storing it as a lisp strcuture is also an idea :))

[19:58:08] <greyrat> I want to mostly read this DAG myself (my own extended family tree), so I am wondering how readable that would be. 
[19:58:38] <greyrat> Neo4j is definitely too heavyweight for this. I really prefer having it in plain text (which includes lisp).
[20:00:07] <Demosthenex> greyrat: org is suitable for you writing out your tree for you to read. how you organize it then still is an issue, though it's like a written document. linking is still an option, which is what tools like org-roam do
[20:02:01] <greyrat> Linking is no good. I can do this on paper very elegantly, and I want sth similar in my digital text.
[20:02:52] <greyrat> (reminds me of this new package `org-real'.)
[20:08:57] <greyrat> https://github.com/storax/graph.el this also looks interesting: it draws a text diagram from the lisp DAG.
[20:11:21] <Demosthenex> greyrat: how is it organized on paper?
[20:12:03] <greyrat> Demosthenex: I just draw the tree there. Take a look at any graph textbooks?

[20:12:29] <greyrat> I just need a good DAG to ascii plotter, and I'll be good.
[20:13:08] <Demosthenex> greyrat: ok, you're not writing text on paper, you're drawing a graph on paper.
[20:13:17] <Demosthenex> org is like writing text on paper, it won't do your graph
[20:14:34] <greyrat> Yes, I just thought perhaps we already had sth. org is wonderful like that.
[20:17:36] <pjb> Demosthenex: programmers have problems with everything, because everything has a more complex structure than the usual description.
[20:18:56] <pjb> google for: falsehood programmers believe about 
[20:19:24] <pjb> There's a page for about everything…
[20:20:04] <pjb> The problem is that human beings work with usual cases and exceptions, but computers must be exhaustive from the start (from the programming phase).
[20:20:40] <Demosthenex> pjb: my fav there is time ;]
[20:21:09] <pjb> You can teach a human about anything telling him the general case, and then spend 10 or 20 years to refine the special cases. But you cannot pamper a program during 10 or 20 years, specially when it's a program that should pilot a rocket, or billions of requests per second…
[20:21:18] <Demosthenex> greyrat: yeah, i think really you're trying to say that written text is inferior to your hand drawn diagram for representing this dataset. and you're absolutely correct.
[20:21:23] <Demosthenex> but that's about text, not org.
[20:21:43] <pjb> greyrat: there's cogre.
[20:22:11] <greyrat> It looked unmaintained? How is artist-mode?
[20:22:48] <pjb> Note: cogre = (let ((start "org")) (rotatef (aref start 1) (aref start 2)) (concat "c" start "e")) #| --> "cogre" |# 
[20:23:00] <pjb> Perhaps it still works.
[20:23:06] <greyrat> http://bloodgate.com/perl/graph/manual/ also looks cool, but it's also from 2007. 
[20:24:14] <greyrat> I will try some of these. I might also give up on the whole ascii thing and use "real" plots.

[20:28:31] <pjb> Then indeed, you can just have a #+begin_src dot block with a graphviz dot graph description.
[20:28:49] <pjb> https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-dot.html
[20:28:54] <pjb> greyrat: ^
[20:29:04] <greyrat> Thanks! 
[20:30:02] <pjb> Then you can have org sections, one per person, with properties for their parents, and you can write some elisp to process them and generate the dot graph.
[20:31:35] <Demosthenex> yep. that's a neat idea. 
[20:31:49] <greyrat> Hmm. That's indeed nice. The biggest problem is the lack of two-way sync between emacs and Apple/Google contacts.
[20:33:03] <greyrat> I am writing some one way vcard to orgmode converter (the one that already exists did not work for me), but syncing from orgmode back into the phone's contacts seems difficult.
[20:33:17] <Demosthenex> greyrat: yes, i have the same problem.
[20:33:47] <Demosthenex> so, i have contacts in a org file with properties, but i can't send it to other devices.
[20:33:48] <greyrat> This Apple/Google duopoly is one of the most stifling things I have seen in life.
[20:33:57] <Demosthenex> actually, i don't blame them directly
[20:34:04] <greyrat> I 100% do.
[20:34:13] <greyrat> I can't even run git on my tablet and phone.
[20:34:21] <Demosthenex> they came to power at the time that we stopped caring about making open standards and open protocols to accomplish computing goals
[20:34:36] <Demosthenex> look at IM. unlike email, IM never standardized
[20:34:41] <greyrat> Because Apple's evil practices are so evil GPL software can't ever work on their "platforms."
[20:34:44] <Demosthenex> nor did sending/syncing contacts and calendar
[20:34:55] <greyrat> Telegram is great.
[20:35:04] <Demosthenex> and the closest thing now is abominations like webdav powered caldav and vcard
[20:35:09] <Demosthenex> no.
[20:35:09] <greyrat> Its server is closed, yes, but its API is so extensible and free.
[20:35:14] <Demosthenex> nope.
[20:35:36] <Demosthenex> IM never standardized, so now we're stranded in everyone makes their own. its the same issue as contact sync
[20:35:44] <greyrat> Well, I have lots of scripts running on Telegram, it even looks like a mini-emacs :))
[20:35:47] <Demosthenex> telegram is just one more implementation
[20:35:57] <Demosthenex> the only IM i can recommend is XMPP
[20:36:00] <greyrat> It's one extensible implementation.
[20:36:10] <greyrat> Like emacs is one extensible editor.
[20:36:19] <greyrat> I really need one extensible anything in my life.
[20:36:24] <Demosthenex> because XMPP is a standard, and an evolving one. with multiple client and server implementations, full federation, etc
[20:36:45] <Demosthenex> everything else is just "we want to make web 2.0 chatsystems that we control"
[20:36:47] <greyrat> Hmm. Why are people flocking to Matrix?
[20:36:53] <Demosthenex> because it's the hot new thing
[20:37:07] <Demosthenex> i haven't seen anything compelling about it yet
[20:37:11] <Demosthenex> other than reinventing hte wheel
[20:37:19] <Demosthenex> look at google, 10x IM products in a decade
[20:37:20] <greyrat> I hope it sticks though. Anything not Discord is a win IMO.
[20:38:08] <Demosthenex> i use mumble. it's better for voice.
[20:38:19] <Demosthenex> and XMPP is great for direct IM and multiuser chat.
[20:38:30] <greyrat> I don't voicechat a lot. I like text best.
[20:38:38] <Demosthenex> if someone ever merged xmpp into mumble as the chat backend, you'd have a discord killer
[20:38:42] <Demosthenex> yeah, i use mumble for gaming
[20:38:49] <Demosthenex> small footprint, never causes issues, stable forever....
[20:39:06] <Demosthenex> but if you like IM, and you want control and extendability, i strongly suggest you look into moving to xmpp
[20:39:50] <greyrat> I am already pretty locked-in in Telegram, as I would need to refactor my current scripts. Most of my social network is also there, plus my univerosty's groups.
[20:42:09] <Demosthenex> exactly. it's not about the software or implementation, it's about domesticating users when their crucial social groups force dependency on a product.
[20:44:31] <Demosthenex> hrm, it appears telegram gives lip service to OSS, but has no open server implementation
[20:44:41] <Demosthenex> its a single network owned by a dubai company

[20:47:50] <Demosthenex> yeah, but i think tikz will be inferior to graphviz
[20:48:05] <Demosthenex> the other issue is scope. how big will the diagram be
