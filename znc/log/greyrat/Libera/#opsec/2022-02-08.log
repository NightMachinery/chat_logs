[18:52:31] <jan6> as the video points out, these things were already on the market, is it apple's fault that they made a better product than everyone else?
[18:55:20] <jan6> it's clear that it's not INTENDED to help criminals, given the 24hour limit before beeping, but just cut out the speaker, what about flashing? same problem, etc, there's nothing that CAN be done, really, to make it "not usable for stalking", especially if people use products where you can't require them to always scan for that product
[18:56:27] <jan6> of course there's even a foss app for android, but point is MOST people won't even know it's a thing
[19:00:24] <jan6> and unlike apple's one, this one actually shows you WHERE the tag was detected, with location tracking (through your own gps or whatnot), and if it finds the same airtag around you at multiple places, it'll notify you
[19:01:01] <jan6> but just as with apple's app, I'm pretty sure you'll need to make sure both are excluded from power saving, and auto-kill lists
[19:01:13] <jan6> which no app is, by default
