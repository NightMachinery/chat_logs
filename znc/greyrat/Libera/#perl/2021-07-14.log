[03:34:43] <zgu|skaro> captive portals need to die
[03:35:24] <zgu|skaro> or adopt an actual formalized protocol... since 99% of websites use https now they're an absolute pain in the ass to use unless you know what you're doing
[03:37:40] <buZz> i like to try using them in lynx/links/w3m first
[03:39:20] <xenu> browsers do they best to detect them but it doesn't always work
[03:39:28] <xenu> i don't understand why it isn't handled on the operating system level
[03:39:52] *** Quits: whynot (~whynot@37.73.60.69) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[03:40:10] <zgu|skaro> actually HSTS is the last nail in the coffin. now you need a known dedicated non-https hostname to use for probes
[03:40:14] <xenu> or to be more precise on wlan protocol level
[03:40:22] <zgu|skaro> unless it's somehow built into the browser
[03:40:27] <xenu> you know, network would signal that there's a need for authentication
[03:40:37] <xenu> and the os would display a login form or something
[03:40:37] <zgu|skaro> a DHCP option or something
[03:40:44] <fizzie> (Android does do a built-in captive portal detection.)
[03:41:23] <Grinnz> yeah, these networks have been operating on MITM as a protocol for a decade
[03:42:10] <zgu|skaro> actually... this might be a fun dhcpcd hook script to try to write. http get a fixed URL, if it comes back with any redirect try to fire it up in a browser
[03:42:26] <fizzie> (Not anything as elegant as having the network signal it, since there's no system for that like you say; it just does a plaintext HTTP request to http://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204 and expects a 204 back.)
[03:42:36] <Grinnz> to such effect that phones automatically test a HTTP request to figure out if they need to present a login page now
[03:43:17] <Grinnz> yeah, what fizzie said
[03:44:25] <zgu|skaro> arg, forgot to update my timezone too
[03:44:34] <zgu|skaro> another thing dhcp should do!
[03:44:54] <Grinnz> if everything worked automatically, what would we have left to do
[03:45:24] <fizzie> Time zones do have a DHCP option already. ;) No idea if anyone's actually using it.
[03:45:59] <zgu|skaro> yeah, that's what i thought
[03:46:40] <fizzie> Oh, also, RFC 8910: "Captive-Portal Identification in DHCP and Router Advertisements (RAs)"
[03:46:46] <zgu|skaro> the fine folks at the IETF have defined all sorts of useful things that most implementations/deployments ignore

[03:49:38] <xenu> apparently the frist version of that rfc is from 2015

[05:35:33] <leitz> mst, recommends and suggests caused me to publish something that seems incorrect. 
[05:35:49] <leitz> Testing the "seems" now.
[05:37:40] <mst> I like -looking- at recommends and suggests
[05:37:58] <mst> but I really don't like having either installed by default
[05:41:30] <Grinnz> i recommend recommends by default, because otherwise there's no point in its existence
[05:41:34] <leitz> Grinnz, YAML::Tiny added Socket, but that was the only other module.
[05:41:41] <Grinnz> but since cpanm still doesn't that's a difficult critical mass to obtain
[05:41:48] <leitz> Now to test Moose.  :P
[05:42:39] <Grinnz> uh, YAML::Tiny doesn't even depend on Socket

[05:44:27] <leitz> Gimme a sec.

[05:45:21] <mst> Grinnz: I do similar for cpan stuff
[05:45:37] <mst> Grinnz: but I get why for -general- users "by default" is sane
[05:46:01] <Grinnz> yeah, that dnf installs them by default is the main reason they're actually useful for rpms
[05:46:16] <Grinnz> (also that dnf can properly deal with installing them optionally)
[05:46:23] <Grinnz> (which cpan installers are still not great at)
[05:46:33] <mst> so does apt, except that I always turn that off on a new debuntu install

[05:47:45] <Grinnz> the word Socket doesn't appear in that log
[05:49:17] <leitz> Grinnz, check the updated gist for the second file.
[05:49:43] <leitz> The only actions I did was install perl from source, and then do cpan YAML::Tiny
[05:49:45] <Grinnz> what is that a diff of?
[05:50:12] <leitz> Results of "cpan -l" after the base install, and then after installing YAML::Tiny.
[05:50:28] <Grinnz> ah, yeah Socket is not actually different
[05:50:41] <Grinnz> it's just on a different line because the configuration bs got spewed into the log
[05:54:11] <leitz> Oddly, Socket is listed twice in the yaml tiny log
[05:56:03] <leitz> Okay, per your suggestion I looked at Moose vice YAML::Tiny. Better example, I'll go edit my PerlMonks page and then crash for the night.

[06:07:13] <Grinnz> the moose dist itself has a significant chunk of those
[06:07:22] <leitz> Yup, and I can provide the "cpan -l" results if you want.  ;)
[06:07:35] <Grinnz> no, that sounds right, i'm just not sure how useful the number is
[06:08:34] <leitz> From a security auditor's perspective, it's fatal.
[06:09:21] <mst> leitz: that entire post on perlmonks is rubbish
[06:09:47] <leitz> That's one of my concerns with Perl; it's good stuff but depending on CPAN will conflict with security audits and actual security. We've already seen issues where languages had harmful code installed.
[06:09:55] <leitz> mst, no it's not.
[06:09:58] <mst> leitz: 'carton install --deployment' fixes 98% of what it complains about
[06:10:11] <Grinnz> leitz: it's not though, several hundred of those modules are installed at the same time within the same distribution
[06:10:22] <Grinnz> it's a single dependency
[06:10:38] <mst> leitz: the auditor issue is reasonable
[06:10:50] <Grinnz> but again, semantics and i'm not sure it matters, just don't think 900 is representative of the problem for Moose
[06:10:58] <leitz> Grinnz, yes, but each bit of code has to be evaluatable.
[06:11:01] <mst> leitz: the rest is rubbish

[06:15:22] <leitz> Carton lets you set the specific version of something?
[06:15:37] <leitz> carton, bundler, *brew, etc....
[06:15:55] <mst> leitz: ... yes?
[06:15:57] <Grinnz> yes
[06:16:00] <mst> leitz: that's its entire point
[06:16:15] <mst> leitz: you'll get exactly the versions of modules you want
[06:16:22] <Grinnz> and moreso, it pins the version, so future carton installs will install that exact version until you specify otherwise
[06:16:31] <leitz> Then you fail. If you can't upgrade, and you can't uninstall, your code doesn't belong on a production server. If you have to pin it to a specific verision, you fail.
[06:16:34] <Grinnz> as opposed to a normal cpanfile or other way of specifying dependencies, which just installs "at least this version" 
[06:16:44] <Grinnz> ????????
[06:16:48] <Grinnz> you can upgrade
[06:16:59] <Grinnz> pinning until you're ready to upgrade is really fucking important for production servers
[06:17:11] <mst> leitz: don't be an idiot please
[06:17:56] <Grinnz> the best intentions in an upgrade path still introduce regressions
[06:18:07] <Grinnz> regressions bring down production services
[06:18:17] <Grinnz> principle doesn't really help much in that scenario
[06:18:17] <leitz> Guys, I have to answer these questions at work all the time. Pinning to a specific version isn't going to fly. Everything I mentioned in that PerlMonks post is something that will prevent Perl from being used in a lot of places that I've worked.
[06:18:39] <mst> leitz: locking things down like this is what your perlmonks points 2, 3 and 5 are solved by
[06:19:16] <Grinnz> of course there's tradeoffs, but the tradeoff being in favor of "don't change stuff without intending to" is pretty important
[06:19:21] <rewt> leitz, pinning doesn't mean a specific version forever and forever; it means that you control the versions, and can upgrade when you want
[06:19:23] <mst> leitz: reacting to the solution by "then you fail" is a dick move
[06:19:25] <leitz> mst, locking down isn't usually accpetable, from a security perspecitve.
[06:19:34] <mst> leitz: ... nobody requires that
[06:19:40] <Grinnz> yes, security updates is the tradeoff, but ... then you just upgrade

[06:20:09] <mst> leitz: you wanted idempotence ... allowing version pinning is how to get idempotence ... stop moving the goalposts please
[06:20:49] *** Joins: yzhernand (~yzhernand@64-18-144-8.starry-inc.net)
[06:21:16] <Grinnz> you cannot get both security updates and consistency in production automatically - especially with community ecosystems that provide features and security updates in the same mechanism (or even most distros, annoyingly)
[06:21:35] <Grinnz> so "consistency until i upgrade as needed" is the compromise
[06:22:15] <leitz> If you upgrade every month or so you usually meet auditor's requirements. The cpan warning about blanket upgrades is an issue.
[06:22:36] <Grinnz> blanket upgrades are a good way to bring down your application, regardless of whatever warnings 
[06:22:43] <leitz> Pinning to a version allows testing and stability at that version, granted.
[06:23:07] <Grinnz> you have to pay attention to what you upgrade, no way around it

[06:23:27] <leitz> But I've done blanket upgrades to OSs for decades.
[06:23:30] <Grinnz> pinning makes that an option instead of a cleanup phase
[06:23:34] <mst> leitz: let me be clear here: you know I like you. you know I know your heart's in the right place. but the way you phrased this stuff sucked.
[06:23:45] <Grinnz> your OS is not a programming ecosystem
[06:23:49] <mst> leitz: yeah, so you do 'carton install', test the updated version, then deploy it

[06:30:40] <leitz> My goal (problem) is that I want to remove barriers to Perl adoption. The CPAN issues I raised are things I have to answer when trying to get Perl used. 
[06:30:46] <Grinnz> leitz: here's how i think you could say what you're trying to say in a more useful way: there's a tradeoff between stability and required security updates for CPAN modules, so using them means you have to figure out how to handle that
[06:32:31] <Grinnz> there isn't that tradeoff in perl itself so much, because 1) it has maintenance branches for a couple years, and 2) breaking changes between major versions are usually well telegraphed and far between

[06:37:52] <mst> leitz: point 2, pm-uninstall works but realistically i always version control my local/ dep tree because uninstall isn't nearly good enoguh for anything
[06:38:16] <Grinnz> yeah my uninstall method in production is "rebuild local/ from the carton bundle"
[06:38:18] <mst> leitz: point 3, cpan is old school unix so it's paranoid but '
[06:38:28] <mst> leitz: point 3, cpan is old school unix so it's paranoid but 'cpanm Module::Name' works fine
[06:38:58] <mst> leitz: point 4, Moo is much lighter on deps but also look at the number of CVEs issued - Moose is damn solid
[06:39:48] <leitz> Maybe Moo has more CVEs because people are using it?   :)
[06:39:51] <mst> leitz: point 5, yes, that's a feature, you want your app's dependencies to be separate from the OS because that makes things way more reliably, predictably, upgradeable and operable 
[06:40:14] <mst> leitz: eh? no, my point is perl stuff is low CVE count because we're not idiots :P
[06:40:45] <Grinnz> except for CGI, we recommend against it for many reasons :P

[17:11:04] <art1> vague: I have to parse a lot of  XML files and need only extract some values via xpaths.  The call "XML::LibXML->load_xml()" and the "XML::LibXML::XPathContext::setContextNode()" are the performance limiting calls. Because  I do not really need a DOM, I would expect, if XML::LibXML uses SAX, it could be a lot faster.
[17:12:34] <art1> vague: Therefore my question, how could I enable SAX if I use XML::LibXML->load_xml()? Or I am completely wrong?
[17:14:05] <vague> I think you are although I'm no expert on LibXML nor SAX
[17:15:28] <kensanata> Reading the XML::LibXML::SAX man page makes me think the XML::SAX::Base man page describes the interface.
[17:15:39] <art1> vague: Thx.

[17:16:50] <vague> XML::SAX::Base has been mentioned already, I assumed that had been checked over and found lacking
[17:17:45] *** Joins: koolazer (~koo@user/koolazer)
[17:19:33] <kensanata> Well, one thing seems clear to me: it's either going to be complete XML document parsing and then searching it with XPath, *or* it's going to be partial parsing using SAX events and implementing the search using something else. I don't think SAX and XPath can go together.
[17:19:37] <art1> kensanata: Not helpful for me. I want to apply XPath expressions (see XML::LibXML::XpathContext) 
[17:20:43] <kensanata> My argument is this: in XPath, you can say "this node, if the next node satisfies some predicate", which is impossible in SAX since the next node hasn't been parsed, yet.
[17:20:52] <haj> art1: To extract just a few elements from huge XML files I found XML::Twig very convenient (and fast)
[17:21:28] <art1> kensanata: My hope was that the XML::LibXML module would abstract this and I could use XML::LibXML::XPathContext to let Xpath expressions be used by internal SAX parser as well. If that doesn't work, then so be it.

[17:32:00] <RandalSchwartz> why say "fad"?
[17:33:03] <RandalSchwartz> generally more efficient than simple REST, although hard to compete with bespoke REST endpoints that do precisely what most people want.

[17:36:10] <simcop2387> yea i've seen it be used for making a more generic interface for a backend data source than multiple rest calls.  beyond uses like that i've usually seen it as a mistake since it usually seems to mean that the interface is too generic and trying to optimize the data being fetched for reports/frontends isn't possible

[17:38:22] <ehuelsmann[m]> Isn't GraphQL just a RESTified RPC?
[17:38:49] <simcop2387> it's not necessarily over REST or http, but usually you do see it on top of those in my experience
[17:39:31] <simcop2387> i've seen it on gRPC and rabbitmq (well something basically the same)
[17:39:54] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.112.166)
[17:40:16] <simcop2387> it's not quite powerful enough on it's own to really be a generic RPC interface though i'm sure someone can force it in there.  and i think that's deliberate by it's design
[17:41:39] <simcop2387> it's all about going, "I want data from these sources in this kind of relationship" without needing to know how that part is implemented beyond the interface you have to request them.
[17:42:14] <simcop2387> or to sometimes do a write but i almost never see that actually

[18:52:11] <haarg> it seems unfortunate that YAML::Tiny has even an optional dependency on JSON::MaybeXS
[18:53:41] <djerius> Botje-: that looks promising (and Types::QuacksLike uses it). unfortunately, not part of API => not something I can put in production code.

[21:12:07] <pragma-> Altreus: sure but which lemmings 2? nintendo, gameboy, sega, genesis, pc? they all have little differences that make people either love lemmings or hate lemmings based on a good or poor first experience
[21:12:20] <gordonfish> I played Lemmings mainly on DOS
[21:12:21] <Altreus> oh I didn't realise. I only had it on PC
[21:12:35] <Altreus> I did know it was on Amiga and I wondered why anyone would try to play it without a mouse
[21:13:04] <Altreus> I guess if you can pause it easily it doesn't matter too much
[21:13:52] <gordonfish> I feel the same way about first person free-movement games, playing them on consoles feels so awkward, a real lack of precision compared to a mouse.
[21:14:18] <gordonfish> TL;DR: mouse > analog stick
[21:14:24] <Altreus> I have sufficient experience to be sure that controller is inferior because I gave up trying to beat Borderlands 2 on the 360
[21:14:31] <Altreus> I beat it easily on PC
[21:14:54] <thrig> the apple //e had a good joystick
[21:14:54] <pragma-> gordonfish: they make up for that by having intelligent quick select cursor movement that snaps to the lemming you probably want to act upon next
[21:14:58] <Altreus> however, I'm happy to play Fallout 4 with a controller because it seems to be somehow far more casual and doesn't actually penalise you for vegging out on the sofa and not caring
[21:15:01] <Grinnz> shooters with joysticks is agony, driving and platforming with kb/mouse is agony
[21:15:04] <gordonfish> Altreus: Really? I thought games like that had auto aim to aid with the lack of precision?

[21:17:15] <Altreus> I refuse to be part of it
[21:17:22] <Grinnz> indeed
[21:17:33] <Altreus> The series is over. Bethesda killed it. Long live Outer Worlds I guess
[21:17:45] <Altreus> is that the right name? I forget
[21:17:49] <pragma-> i was dubious about fallout 3 but it turned out to be pretty good. faithful reproduction of the 2d series. by beyond that it kind became more pop-culturey.
[21:17:55] <gordonfish> qr{ apple (?: \Q//e\E | \Q][\E ) }xi
[21:18:07] <Grinnz> outer worlds is pretty entertaining
[21:18:15] <Grinnz> the sequel is coming
[21:18:21] <Altreus> People rate New Vegas more than 3 because it was made by Obsidian rather than Bethesda and was therefore *actually* an extension of the original 2
[21:18:44] <Grinnz> new vegas had more interesting branches to be sure
[21:18:49] <Altreus> Then Bethesda stopped letting Obsidian have their IP back and now it's a wreck
[21:18:51] <pragma-> yeah, fallout 3 has a very elder scrolls feel to it sometimes now that you mention it
[21:19:36] <pragma-> you can always tell an elder scrolls engine by the speech dialogue interface
[21:19:40] <pragma-> the way the camera centers
[21:19:48] <Altreus> in fact the reason I don't like Skyrim is because I played it on xbox and ... well I couldn't. It was impossible.
[21:20:02] <gordonfish> Outer Worlds as in the Princ of Persia style rotoscope graphics game? I liked that one (along with Prince of Persia) back on DOS
[21:20:13] <Altreus> Yeah. FO4 was weird because of how the world continued while you spoke to people

[21:32:25] <Grinnz> anthem had lots of potential, they squandered it by trying to make things "challenging" rather than embrace the iron man feeling
[21:33:15] <pragma-> at least borderlands put you in the game at the beginning and had a clear direction for you to follow. destiny 2 just threw me into the middle of the game into the city with like 500 notifications of things to do and i was lost.
[21:33:44] <Grinnz> borderlands does a good job of being a pretty good single player game, that is also designed for co-op
[21:33:51] <pragma-> destiny 2 also quickly upgraded me to nearly maximum powerlevel really fast
[21:33:52] <Grinnz> destiny kinda missed that first part
[21:33:56] <pragma-> so i swiftly lost interest
[21:35:23] <pragma-> iirc, whenever i got a more powerful weapon, the enemies just got more health too, so it felt samey-samey
[21:35:45] <thrig> balancing games is stupidly hard

[21:36:25] <pragma-> thrig: back in the 90's when i leveled up on a mud, if i went back to a newbie area i could just mow over everything with 1 hit, that used to take me 10 hits
[21:36:52] <pragma-> but then i'd just be getting 1 or so xp points and it woudln't be worthwhile
[21:37:16] <pragma-> that balance seemed to work well enough!
[21:38:31] <pragma-> i dont care for this trend of leveling up the monsters along with your character
[21:38:44] <thrig> those are called windshield kills in some games

[21:42:14] <revhippie> like "Reformed Troll", "Reformed Crey", etc.
[21:42:30] <Grinnz> homecoming has some... unfortunate management
[21:42:58] <revhippie> Grinnz: Aww, nuts.  I'll have to check out Rebirth, then.
[21:43:17] <Grinnz> plenty of drama there but suffice to say, the people that run it have egos :P
[21:44:10] <Grinnz> which is why it's unfortunate that it's the one that got the critical mass of players

[23:06:18] <mst> nirnam: also Lexical::Context which is undocumented but is part of my pure perl async/await and generator implementation

[23:29:11] <mst> nirnam: E::WL provides a pure perl repl 'tinyrepl' in the dist
[23:29:44] <mst> nirnam: also a few things apparently use it: https://metacpan.org/module/Eval::WithLexicals/requires?size=100

[23:29:48] <mst> nirnam: so I think that counts
[23:30:11] <mst> (ignore Tak, that was an experiment of mine that got replaced by Object::Remote)

[23:43:38] <nirnam> I'm highly interest something in the vien of B::C atm, have to get a grip on the perl compiler backend first
[23:48:04] <haarg> B:C has very little to do with B
[23:52:01] <nirnam> I have no clue how it would work back then, and why it didn't work now, a little infomation would help
[23:52:35] <mst> nirnam: why are you interested in that? (genuine question)
[23:54:46] <nirnam> mst: I'd love to be able to
[23:54:51] <nirnam> and a little curious
[23:55:16] <mst> nirnam: yes, but I mean, able to what and why
[23:55:56] <acidsys> hi, does someone know something newer than Net::SSH2 that supports ed25519 SSH keys? or does it support them and my LIBSSH2_ERROR_PUBLICKEY_UNVERIFIED is caused by a syntax issue? here's my code: https://pasta.lysergic.dev/?19e38208af5c4ffc#GkFBnvUgryBd84yH4BHM6KpZVjs4jEk1dTnQxePaYMoh
[23:55:57] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ TrippyBin ]
[23:56:39] <mst> acidsys: Net::OpenSSH will use your local ssh binary, that's always been less annoying for me
[23:57:01] <acidsys> oh perfect, I didn't stumble across that one, thank you very much mst 
[23:57:59] <nirnam> mst: I get my feet into making a compiler recently and learned that once upon a time you can compile my fevortie language, other than that I don't really have answer for the why
[23:58:00] <mst> acidsys: my personal rule is basically "unless I'm trying to do something sufficiently batshit it isn't an option, just use that"
[23:58:18] <mst> nirnam: that's a completely fair answer
[23:58:44] <mst> acidsys: also amusingly the author added support for my Object::Remote
[23:59:04] <acidsys> mst: ye, if I found it upon searching I would have jumped to it earlier :) 
[23:59:06] <acidsys> nice
[23:59:09] <mst> acidsys: which is hilarious cos Object::Remote's ssh code is significantly inspired by Net::OpenSSH
[23:59:24] <acidsys> wait the author of SSH2 ?
[23:59:27] <mst> (I think I told the author that and thanked him)
[23:59:36] <mst> acidsys: Net::OpenSSH
[23:59:39] <acidsys> ohh
[23:59:44] <acidsys> heh
