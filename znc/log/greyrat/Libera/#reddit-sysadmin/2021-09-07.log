[23:36:39] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> People use "they" singular all the time already.
[23:36:48] <sintax> onenerdguy that's fantastic
[23:37:00] <vinrock> bottleneck i know thats the issue we're discussing
[23:37:04] <Bru^> noice
[23:37:10] <catbeard> when people use they to refer to themselves, and you're like looking for the other person behind them
[23:37:12] <vinrock> thanks bru
[23:37:29] <sintax> catbeard and vinrock that's when I smile and just let them ramble. 
[23:37:43] <sintax> i'm usually already lost before that and have no idea what's going on. and thinking of the shit I know i need to get done
[23:37:50] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> I've never had the opportunity to actually call a person "they", but I use it all the time to make genderless instructions

[23:38:01] <sintax> ooh do let us know how that goes. 
[23:38:05] <vinrock> i havet experienced it in conversation, only in reading
[23:38:11] <vinrock> and thats where it fuks me up
[23:38:15] <vinrock> because i cant slap the shit out of a computer
[23:38:18] <sintax> yeah reading would be harder i think
[23:38:28] <sintax> vinrock: but you can office space a pc
[23:38:29] <catbeard> you could copy/paste and search/replace they with I
[23:38:33] <catbeard> and see if it makes more sense

[23:39:34] <sd> 13<C​olour> Haha wow
[23:39:43] <vinrock> yeah thats probably why its more a pain in the ass to read there
[23:40:50] <sintax> One more thing to ship out and then 7 pc's to pack up and match back to the box they came in. 
[23:41:40] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> @Colour During the interviews, they were talking to the devs about their apps and the infra. They didn't know the answers, so it went to me, and the guy literally stopped and was like "Wait. Aren't you the Sysadmin? And he's the Senior Developer? Why are you answering these things?"
[23:41:50] <sintax> also my scripts are killing me. I've had 7 users add tickets today. My scripts have opened and closed 60
[23:41:55] <vinrock> lol
[23:42:00] <sd> 13<C​olour> Nice
[23:42:03] <sintax> lol
[23:42:03] <pitastrudl> nice
[23:42:13] <sintax> automation is the best way to go. 
[23:42:19] <sintax> just makes a mess of my ticketing system
[23:42:24] <sd> 13<C​olour> In a few years I feel like I'll be in the same position
[23:42:59] <sintax> Nothing wrong with it as long as your compensated for it. 
[23:43:33] <sintax> its the places you work and learn and grow and get more responsibility but no title or compensation for it. 
[23:44:02] <Cl0udNinja> anyone here work with GCP and ZFS?

[23:44:46] <Cl0udNinja> we've never had any issues
[23:45:04] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> how? are you getting dedicated instances/hardware? I'm just thinking the disk's being passed through and how ZFS hates any kind of raid controller in front of it
[23:45:05] <sintax> it wasn't the main guy
[23:45:22] <Cl0udNinja> onenerdguy when it gets to VM land that shit doesnt exist
[23:45:23] <sintax> was the zookeeper.
[23:45:36] <Cl0udNinja> the abstraction layer of the VM makes everything act self contained
[23:45:38] <Cl0udNinja> disks are disks
[23:45:40] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> hmm
[23:45:49] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> I thought it got mad if it couldn't get down to actual hardware level.
