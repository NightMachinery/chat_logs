[17:06:04] <riv> IAB = Interactive Advertising Bureau

[17:06:23] <kline> riv, GDPR "consent" popup broker full of dark patterns found to be illegal
[17:06:51] *** Quits: leon (~znc@user/leon) (Quit: see you later, alligator)
[17:06:55] <kline> so the days of having to click through multiple levels of opt-out switches should hopefully start to come to an end
[17:07:21] <bkhl> Well, depends on the strength of enforcement I guess.
[17:07:57] <kline> google, amazon, and microsoft have been required to delete data
[17:08:25] <bkhl> Yeah, the question is if they'll go down the food chain and actually enforce it from small players too.
[17:08:40] <kline> so it now has a measurable impact on those businesses, hopefully this incentivises the market to use better solutions
[17:08:44] <riv> so it means 1 click instead of multiple? but still having popups :|
[17:08:53] <bkhl> Yeah, I'm with you in hoping it has the desired effect.
[17:09:17] <bkhl> riv, well, and by law they need to be clear and not confusing, and rejecting should be as easy as accepting.
[17:09:19] <riv> can we get some people who know what an IP address is to help with making laws about computers
[17:09:29] <kline> riv, not yet, hopefully it means that ad networks like google will demand that websites do not use popups with such dark patterns
[17:10:22] <kline> the regulator is going down the route of making the data collected with such popups unusable, with the hope that in a choice between regulator interference and doing the right thing, ad networks will tilt towards doing the right thing
[17:10:23] <bkhl> Best case it should be an incentive to switch to forms of advertisement and so on that doesn't require the tracking stuff.
[17:10:24] <kline> we'll see
[17:10:55] <bkhl> You don't need this stuff if you only use cookies for actual user functionality, and show non-targeted ads without recording who viewed them.
[17:11:05] <drobilla> Persistent browser setting, please...
[17:11:09] <kline> but importantly it sets the precendent that telling google et al to delete their data if its not collected correctly, even with """consent""", run s the risk
[17:11:14] <bkhl> Yeah, we'll see what new fresh hell the ad business comes up with. :-)
[17:11:27] <kline> drobilla, persistent browser settings? like a cookie that stores your preferences?
[17:11:47] <bkhl> drobilla, it would have been cool if GDPR mandated that the "no tracking" setting must be seen as automatic rejection.
[17:11:58] <riv> i just hate this whole popup thing so much
[17:11:59] <drobilla> kline: Yeah, so I don't have to figure out what annoying tedious way to get to "no non-mandatory cookies" on every site ever
[17:12:15] <riv> im so tired of being impeded when trying to do things
[17:12:21] <kline> drobilla, problem is, each website has its own cookie namespace
[17:12:34] <kline> so youd still need to do it at least once for every domain
[17:12:46] <kline> riv, then "just" click yes
[17:12:52] <riv> thats literally the problem
[17:12:53] <bkhl> Unless something like the "no tracking" browser setting actually started being respected.
[17:12:54] <riv> having to click yes
[17:13:00] <riv> over and over again
[17:13:04] <drobilla> kline: Problems are meant to be solved? :)
[17:13:05] <kline> theyre never following DNT
[17:13:09] <bkhl> Well, the law makers think there are more serious problems than that inconvenience …
[17:13:12] <bkhl> And I agree with them.
[17:13:37] <bkhl> Anyway, if the GDPR was followed to the letter you wouldn't be seeing confusing popups.
[17:13:44] <bkhl> Since those are explicitly not allowed in that law.
[17:14:57] <bkhl> Not to mention that a lot of those annoying popups are basically placebo buttons.
[17:15:12] <bkhl> A lot of those sites already make requests to adsense and what not before you even can click anything.

[17:21:51] <bkhl> I use the "I don't care about cookies" blocklist in uBlock origin.
[17:21:55] <bkhl> That takes care of a lot of them.
[17:21:56] <riv> DNT was also a big brain move
[17:22:08] <riv> add an extra bit of entropy for tracking people called 'do not track'
[17:22:10] <bkhl> I don't like that actual browser plugin, because that also actually clicks "accept" for you on some sites.
[17:22:22] <riv> I wish alanis morisette was here today
[17:22:46] <bkhl> Together with another plugin that expires all cookies when the tabs for that domains are closed (except for whitelisted sites), that's working out pretty well.
[17:22:48] <riv> I need to get that block list
[17:23:00] <bkhl> Well, for you maybe you'll be alright with the plugin.
[17:23:13] <bkhl> The plugin also takes care of accepting cookies on a lot of sites where just removing the overlay doesn't work

[17:27:32] <riv> I started using youtube app to watch youtube videos on phone
[17:27:42] <riv> so i am seeing adverts for the first time in many years
[17:28:00] <riv> there's a lot of ads that are for stuff that is obviously scams
[17:28:02] <bkhl> Makes you wonder who can stand that stuff, right?
[17:28:08] <riv> yes it is very strange
[17:28:23] <bkhl> Well, a lot of people can't and use Tiktok instead, I understand.
[17:28:28] <riv> there's stuff like quantum healing, money related scams, various fake stuff..
[17:28:49] <bkhl> Yeah, basically cable TV ads.
[17:28:49] <iDrougge> I only use marginal stuff on Youtube so I seldom see such ads.
[17:29:01] <riv> the ads are usually made with a computer voice narrating to stock images
[17:29:17] <riv> and they talked about this utterly bizarre fake 5g system that was 'invented' by an ex-marine
[17:29:26] <bkhl> OK, basically cable TV ads but with lower production values. :-)
[17:29:54] <riv> I just thought that you could only read advertise legit stuff.. there's surely some controls and laws
[17:29:59] <riv> s/read/really/
[17:30:34] <bkhl> I've only really accidentally seen Youtube ads here in Sweden, and they have been pretty highend stuff usually.
[17:30:41] <riv> there was another one where someone was recommending to buy a huge building for $1 using borrowed money, the not pay builders to fix it up until after i made back the profits from renting it out
[17:30:42] <bkhl> Like car companies and so on.
[17:31:08] <riv> I don't really understand what the hell that was about but im pretty sure if you try this out you can end up scuppered
[17:31:41] <bkhl> Yeah, or you can end up president.
[17:31:48] <riv> :-)
[17:31:49] <drobilla> You get a viral video of contractors smashing down your balconies with a back hoe or whatever out of the deal
[17:31:54] <iDrougge> I mostly use Youtube in single-use windows, so I can't wait for the courts to kill that cookie modal that covers more than the height of my screen.

[17:46:46] <gwozniak> verb tense issues there, but you get the idea...
[17:47:35] <bkhl> Here on my end I'm thinking of renaming a directory in our project called 'monorepo'
[17:47:57] <gwozniak> If we had fewer repos here we'd be better off
[17:48:00] <bkhl> It has some scripts that were created in conjunction with moving from Bazaar to Git and at the same time moving the whole product into a monorepo.

[23:34:05] <scubagear[m]> That code generated by AlphaCode looks unmaintainable though. Gonna need an AI to maintain that AI-generated code.
[23:36:18] <varjag> step 1: implement alphacode as alphacode output

[23:43:33] <lep> is it moond in dutch?
[23:43:57] <lep> ddg says no
[23:44:17] <lep> b/c it's "Mond" in german
[23:48:20] <rb> i feel like as computer systems evolve they will eventually become organic-like, code having its own language that is normally incomprehensible like DNA
[23:49:39] <lep> i already think being able to "quickyl" get into foreign code bases is a nice skill to have
[23:49:50] <rb> just more and more layers of abstraction until the creators are abstracted away
