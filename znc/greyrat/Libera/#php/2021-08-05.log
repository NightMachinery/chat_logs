[00:57:11] <dukenukem3d> It seems firefox does not record the cookie. Why do I not find any information on php.net about "domain" related to cookies? There must be a function to set the domain the cookie is valid for or where is my brain-bug?
[00:58:25] <dukenukem3d> oh setcookie is it, right? mh...
[01:01:46] <__adrian> dukenukem3d: you should simply session_start()
[01:03:16] <dukenukem3d> as i said, it works with get variable but does not yet with cookies. I did not find a set cookie. Trying with manual setcookie("PHPSESSID"... now
[01:03:16] <__adrian> there's nothing else to do about it. just don't pass the "don't use cookies" options.
[01:03:24] <__adrian> no
[01:03:28] <__adrian> DO NOT use setcookie()

[01:11:05] <__adrian> same as any other cookie, it defaults to "" and the browser uses the current domain

[03:53:14] <ordos> Byteflux, the only channel I sit in is #php on libera. For old time's sake. I'm sentimental.
[03:54:56] <Byteflux> Nice. It's a good channel. #php since Freenode and now Libera has been a part of my life for... well, about half my life :)
[03:55:07] <Byteflux> And I'm 34 now :P
[03:55:28] <ordos> We'll you've been in here longer than I it seems
[03:55:37] <ordos> I remember asking cythrawll "How do I make a login page?" around 15 years ago, and then proceeded to earn a living as a PHP developer; so yeah I stick around
[03:55:40] <Byteflux> It's good to see familiar faces still around too, many who predate me. Such as TML, BigE, just to name a couple :P
[03:56:26] <ordos> who was that other guy
[03:56:53] <ordos> It was like this nightly trio of ops at one point
[03:56:54] <Byteflux> Yeah similar story, thanks to the knowledge accumulated over the years from this channel I also got into PHP professionally
[03:57:25] <Byteflux> 15 years ago, we're probably talking about PHP 4.2 :D
[03:57:36] <Byteflux> Maybe even PHP 5's very early days

[03:59:15] <Byteflux> Well, if you wanna get technical it's 8.0.something :)
[03:59:37] <ordos> If I wanted to get technical I'd suggest 8.0 is "8.nothing" ;-)

[04:00:59] <Byteflux> Probably more fun to go on "back in my day, there were no namespaces and we had to use `var` instead of type declarations, had to type `array()` everywhere instead of `[]`" :D

[04:03:19] <Poboy> lulz @ 8.something though.  Makes sense to me!
[04:03:55] <ordos> Poboy, hi; I was inviting you to observe the talking and interaction between two old timers, in response to your questioning why so many people idle here
[04:04:44] <Byteflux> I don't really remember BBS games, don't really remember BBSs that well anymore. I vaguely remember some Perl BBS CGI scripts, but as far as games it's mostly Flash and web-based turn-based games :P
[04:05:28] <ordos> Yeah man. The next generation of kids will get the same experience with WebGL games
[04:06:05] <ordos> I lived on BBS. It's what got me through the dull journey of high school
[04:06:59] <ordos> I was reading a great article on the origins of Commander Keen this morning, and fondly recalled playing the shareware version of it's free demo stage
[04:07:11] <Poboy> Wow, some of y'all are probably older than me.  I lived on Oregon Trail (in jr high, not high school0.
[04:07:42] <Poboy> Sadly no computer of any kind for us po' folk.  Finally got a shitty PC in college
[04:08:45] <ordos> What PC was it?
[04:09:14] <Byteflux> The first Oregon Trail definitely predates me. I've played it in school, but it was well past its prime at that point. Probably in the 90s.
[04:09:55] <ordos> I think they meant they literally live on the Orgeon Trail
[04:10:14] <ordos> *lived
[04:10:32] <Byteflux> Oh well I guess it's not the first one. By first I meant the Apple II one, which apparently isn't the first.
[04:10:49] <Byteflux> Ah okay lol
[04:11:24] <Byteflux> My brain just connects it with the game because I don't think I remember anyone actually talking about living there
[04:12:41] <Byteflux> PCs were definitely a luxury in the 90s and early 2000s. My first was a >$2000 Compaq

[10:04:11] <TML> crazyfrog: Looks like you probably have an unterminated quote on a previous line.
[10:05:41] <TML> it's seeing a string somewhere as: '; echo ' - and then thinks "<a href" is supposed to be PHP code. And while it can, in this case, make something valid out of "less than a", as soon as it hits "href" it chokes.
[10:06:27] <TML> https://3v4l.org/8ZjfM
[10:08:04] <crazyfrog> this is the begin of the function before are just global option set https://paste.debian.net/hidden/6652641b/
[10:14:43] <Byteflux> Unlikely that error relates to that code, perhaps it's an older error or the code that's actually being run is outdated. Don't want to take too many guesses, but if you're editing files remotely perhaps it's out of sync.
[10:16:04] <Byteflux> Or the unterminated quote is much further up
[10:16:12] <Byteflux> That's also a possibility I suppose.
[10:17:14] <Byteflux> It's possible for the unterminated quote to be before that for loop and still produce the same error message.

[10:50:26] <sumthing1980> any experts on the ob functions?
[10:51:41] <sumthing1980> I want to automatically send all output to another computer, but I think warnings and errors will not be sent, can they be sent if I do a register shutdown function that saves and sends  output even if an error is given?
[10:55:42] <biberu> what do you mean by sending it to another computer?
[10:56:46] <sumthing1980> there are scripts running on some computers, they may get errors and warnings occasionally that I should fix on the main computer, all output will be sent to the main computer so I can see whats going on
[10:58:36] <biberu> i don't understand why, are you using logging and monitoring and if so why isn't that enough?
[10:59:14] <sumthing1980> the alternative is going to each computer and look at the screen output
[10:59:49] <sumthing1980> does the ob functions send the php errors and how to do that, is it by using shutdown functions
[11:00:02] <biberu> so you're not logging?
[11:00:55] <sumthing1980> manually logging the data I expect is fine, but the unexpected should be sent as well
[11:00:59] <sumthing1980> like warnings and errors
[11:01:28] <sumthing1980> and if a script ends with error, how will I send all output even the errors and warnings, to another computer
[11:02:28] <biberu> i still don't understand why you need to do that instead of logging, perhaps you're not aware of it? are you using e.g. the php error log? are you logging other things going on in your application to either that or some specific place?
[11:03:12] <sumthing1980> what I mean with logging is not the php system, but my own
[11:03:25] <sumthing1980> text is stored as files for example
[11:03:38] <sumthing1980> computer a sends text to b and b stores it
[11:03:55] <sumthing1980> a should send all output from all runs of some scripts
[11:04:06] <sumthing1980> including errors and warnings that the scripts may give
[11:04:14] <sumthing1980> they are like webcrawlers
[11:04:21] <sumthing1980> occasional errors occur
[11:04:32] <sumthing1980> newly developing it
[11:04:56] <sumthing1980> unexpected input may yet give errors and warnings
[11:08:52] <sumthing1980> did I make it clear?
[11:10:16] <biberu> still not quite following, but perhaps this helps: at (b) i'd log anything that happens in that application, then i'd make all those logs available in some central monitoring tool that can alert when problems arise (these would be your exceptions and whatnot, raw messages)
[11:10:41] <biberu> if (a) needs to know something on the *application level* perhaps (b) could return the results and/or the error in a more structured form, e.g. { ok: "this is my result", error(s): ["error_type_abc"] }, these messages would be at a higher level that (a) can understand and act upon, if (a) and (b) can't agree on a protocol or (a) if can't do
[11:10:42] <biberu> anything about an error perhaps it's easier to just say that the operation failed

[11:11:34] <sumthing1980> ok so I have a function o() that is called instead of echo
[11:11:57] <sumthing1980> I will use that to store output to a file AND echo whatever parameter is given
[11:12:34] <sumthing1980> when the run of script is finished I call a function that does file_get_contents and sends the log text file to computer b
[11:12:56] <sumthing1980> it will work fine for all regular output like echo
[11:13:10] <sumthing1980> but if there are some notices warnings and errors, how can I also send them
[11:13:29] <biberu> with logging...
[11:13:37] <sumthing1980> like sending everything that pops up on the screen
[11:13:51] <sumthing1980> like this   ini_set('error_log', '/path/my-error-file.log');
[11:13:54] <sumthing1980> ?
[11:13:59] <sumthing1980> and maybe send that file
[11:14:50] <biberu> you probably don't have to send it anywhere, you just need to make it available to your monitoring setup
[11:14:51] <sumthing1980> I havent used internal error logging much of php
[11:16:06] <biberu> if you're using some framework it may have logging utilities already

[14:08:24] <Byteflux> Their methodology does not in any way seem to explain the relationship between professional experience and job salary. It only states that the job salaries are based on current jobs.
[14:08:53] <Byteflux> Also expect results to be heavily skewed towards particular technologies and as a result salaries disproportionately affected by regional differences.
[14:09:07] <Naktibalda> according to sallary graph there is twice as many Python developers as PHP developers

[14:12:40] <Byteflux> These salary/language graphs would be more useful with geographic filters.

[15:31:25] <DanGer> AllenJB, well yeah, unfortunately :(
[15:35:02] <AllenJB> I don't understand why multisort() is looping the function arguments. And the way that function has been written I think the only way you could replace it without modifying callers is using eval.
[15:36:08] <AllenJB> A quick look at the project shows the code is originally from 2005 with only minor compatibility updates since. I would suggest it should stay there and you should find a more recently written tool that does the same job instead
[15:41:18] <Naktibalda> lol, that code looks like it was written for PHP 3, but it has one class so it requires 4.0 at least
[15:47:55] <biberu> DanGer: can you work with pureftpds config directly instead?
[15:52:20] <NakedKing> Any difference exist betweeen "and" - "&&" in php?
[15:52:33] <biberu> NakedKing: yes, precedence

[16:01:10] <Nomikos> function GetElement() { return $this; } // I wonder what the usecase for this would be
[16:09:12] <Naktibalda> in isolation it looks pointless, but it is certainly possibly to come up with situation where this method may be necessary.
[16:09:58] <Naktibalda> For example if GetElement is part of interface and only one of implementations implements Element too.
[16:11:38] <NakedKing> @biberu, elseif ($username!="" && $password!="") : ... (if username and password inputs are not null then call mysql for check)  At this situation what do you prefer to use? AND or && ?

[16:29:07] <biberu> NakedKing: my validation would look quite different, and about the operator you need to know when to use which one
[16:29:56] <arash> NakedKing, you should add ! before empty, so the condition is true when your variable is not empty or null, but as biberu said if someone set 0 for username or password its not working
[16:30:12] *** Quits: fahrradToken (~fahrradTo@ip5f59f4f3.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:30:52] <Naktibalda> !empty is the same as != ''   it is better to use !== ''
[16:31:18] <biberu> Blondie101010: sure, it's unlikely, but empty is still sneaky and i'd prefer something more explicit, but my validation wouldn't look like that at all so...
[16:31:42] <Blondie101010> NakedKing:  I don't get why you need the elseif to confirm that both fields are empty
[16:33:08] <Blondie101010> it could simply be: `if (!isset($username) || !isset($password) || $username === "" || $password === "") {`
[16:33:42] <biberu> i'm guessing that $username comes from a form, so you'd should check if it exists, if it's a string (could be an array), if it's valid for your expected encoding, if it's valid for the format of usernames (i'd have an actual username type that knows this, but at the very least non-zero length) etc.
[16:34:24] <biberu> all of that is too much for declaring inline in an if condition, so i'd just build a rule out of it, and use that
[16:35:47] <phreaknerd> !empty has the positive side effect of not throwing a warning/notice when checking against a non-exitent variable/property.
[16:36:35] <Blondie101010> of course, but biberu expressed his concern against the negative side effect, though in this case it's quite limited
[16:38:58] <NakedKing> Naktibalda, what is difference between !='' / !==''  ?
[16:39:37] <Blondie101010> == means equivalent value, but === means exact match
[16:39:46] <Blondie101010> the first allows type juggling
[16:40:02] <Blondie101010> like 0 == "0"
[16:40:12] <NakedKing> i see now
[16:40:21] <NakedKing> yes i need !==
[16:41:57] <biberu> == will also give you possibly unexpected results like "0e1" == "0e2"
[16:46:02] <Blondie101010> hmmm, I wonder if there's a good reason for that case
[16:47:51] <Blondie101010> if I had designed the language, it would not juggle when both variables are the same type
[16:48:06] *** Joins: zelest (jesper@81-233-184-27-no13.tbcn.telia.com)
[16:48:22] <biberu> yeah, it'd be interesting to know the history behind that
[16:48:26] <zelest> Am I right to assume that PHP's flock() is broken?
[16:48:27] <Blondie101010> it's obviously made to prefer numeric value
[16:48:39] <Blondie101010> no flock works fine
[16:48:51] <Blondie101010> but your FS/OS might not support it
[16:49:01] <zelest> I open a file for writing (w+), then flock() it using LOCK_EX (exclusively) then try to open it again with another fopen, also writing (w+) .. and it works just fine to open it?
[16:49:10] <zelest> Shouldn't the second fopen fail?
[16:49:22] <zelest> Tried both on OpenBSD and Linux (Debian)
[16:49:35] <Blondie101010> the lock is per process
[16:49:50] <zelest> Yeah, testing it in CLI, using the same script.
[16:49:52] *** Joins: harpia (~harpia@58.148.205.168.dynamic.vibefibra.com.br)
[16:50:03] <zelest> Oh
[16:50:10] <zelest> So the same process can open it multiple times
[16:51:01] <Blondie101010> put a sleep after the flock() and run another instance of the script
[16:51:12] <zelest> Already on it :)
[16:51:56] <zelest> Ah!
[16:52:02] <zelest> Thanks for clarifying :)
[16:52:11] <Blondie101010> np
[16:52:35] <zelest> It's lovely to see that the second flock just waits instead of failing
[16:52:54] <Blondie101010> there's options for that
[16:52:55] <zelest> Saves the user the trouble of writing the sleep/try-again dance
[16:53:06] <zelest> Yeah, saw it :)
[16:53:09] <biberu> zelest: if you were trying to just fopen from somewhere else without locking, lookup advisory locking
[16:53:36] <zelest> biberu, I plan on writing to a file
[16:54:21] <Blondie101010> flock() is so simple to use and well implemented that it is often used for other things than file operations

[18:39:20] <robertparkerx> How do you exit or break after first while?
[18:40:18] <robertparkerx> nevermind
[18:42:00] <sshine> using PHPUnit 8.5 I've got a line $this->assertEquals($expectedFrom, $message->getFrom()); and running this test I get Array (...) does not match expected type "string". how can I make the error more informative when running the test?
[18:43:38] <__adrian> most phpunit assertions have a final argument where you can provide a custom message. check their docs, and i believe phpunit has a channel here on libera.
[18:44:58] <__adrian> https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/8.5/assertions.html
[18:46:01] <sshine> __adrian, I was hoping that there'd be an assertion that showed the diff.
[18:46:19] <__adrian> you can make the message anything you like
[18:47:23] <sshine> so it isn't common to print the actual values when the assertion fails?
[18:47:50] <__adrian> phpunit's defaults depends on the assertion and how it failed
[18:48:00] <__adrian> showing a diff between a string and an array doesn't make much sense
[18:48:13] <sshine> sure it does
[18:48:19] <__adrian> it's not the expected type. so it tells you what the expected type was.
[18:48:27] <sshine> if the array is ['from' => 'herp derp'], I'll know from running the test that I missed one step.
[18:48:50] <__adrian> if you want to see it, then sure. dump it out in a custom $message.
[18:48:56] <__adrian> that's why it's there
[18:49:26] <sshine> and if I want it every time, extend the test framework. gotcha. :)
[18:49:50] * __adrian shrugs
[18:49:53] <__adrian> if you want it
[18:49:57] <sshine> every time.
[18:50:00] <Naktibalda> you can append var_export($actualValue, true) to message parameter
[18:50:19] <sshine> thanks!
[18:50:32] <Naktibalda> you get the diff when type matches
[18:50:57] <sshine> ok
[18:55:51] *** Joins: Anticom (~Anticom@ip-88-153-48-20.hsi04.unitymediagroup.de)
[18:57:39] <Anticom> Hi folks. Who (if any) does handle the charset in Content-Type header for incomming requests? We're having issues with our laravel app receiving requests for a webhook from a 3rd party where there's no prior content type negotioation and they're sending their data with ISO-8859-1 encoding.
[18:59:25] <sshine> Anticom, sounds like guesswork.
[19:01:13] <Naktibalda> are they sending charset?
[19:01:30] <Anticom> Naktibalda: yes
[19:01:30] <__adrian> ^ the client sets the Content-type header
[19:02:14] <__adrian> so their request _does say_ "ISO-8859-1" ?
[19:02:17] <Naktibalda> I have never seen charset used in request content-type
[19:02:30] <Anticom> __adrian: yes
[19:03:05] <__adrian> maybe i'm not understanding your question then. what do you mean by "handle the charset" ?
[19:04:43] <Anticom> __adrian: Well I'm using input method on the request class laravel is giving me to pull out the data from the json body but when i try to insert it into the db (and it's containing umlauts for example) it's failing (request::input ref: https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/requests#retrieving-an-input-value)
[19:05:11] <Naktibalda> JSON with ISO-8859-1 data?
[19:05:16] <Anticom> The error is SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1366 Incorrect string value: '\xFCter-P...' for column 'lastname' at row 1 (SQL: <...>)
[19:05:21] <__adrian> ^ that's not valid at all
[19:05:27] <Anticom> The request is comming from xing events ticket shop
[19:05:30] <Naktibalda> JSON must be utf-8
[19:05:31] <__adrian> if it's not utf-8, it's not json
[19:05:50] <biberu> Anticom: you should always check that incoming text is valid for your expected charset
[19:05:53] <Anticom> sadly can't give you the headers right away... even ngrok gave up on this
[19:06:17] <Anticom> biberu: good point but doesn't really help me solve my current problem :)
[19:06:26] <__adrian> Content-type: application/json  implicitly means utf-8. if you're getting "json" as iso-8859-1 then the client request is bad and you should reject it
[19:06:45] <Anticom> __adrian: sadly not an option to reject it :/
[19:06:56] <__adrian> that's literally the only valid option
[19:07:16] <NakedKing> I'm looking for a PHP IDE which is fully libre
[19:07:31] <NakedKing> have someone got a suggestion?
[19:07:38] <biberu> Anticom: it doesn't? when you receive the message you convert it to your internal encoding, if the client provided encoding information that you wish to support you can use that, and then you proceed as usual
[19:07:54] <__adrian> if you want to try to convert the encoding the use iconv or similar.
[19:09:32] <__adrian> but you'd have to handle that completely on your own; no sane/correct tool will do it for you
[19:11:01] <biberu> it's very strange of them to send json as iso-8859-1, which is an odd encoding to begin with, people usually mean something else when they say that
[19:11:30] <__adrian> likely means (among other things) that they wrote their own json "encoder"
[19:19:34] <Anticom> Hm well afaik Laravel's request abstraction builds upon Symfony's one. Any clue how to get the raw body from symfony request class so i can try convert the charset before json_decoding it?
[19:22:08] <Anticom> __adrian: Also https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159#section-8.1 states that it SHALL be UTF-8
[19:22:21] <__adrian> https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation.html#request  seems they have a method getContent()
[19:23:03] <__adrian> Anticom: ...yes, that's what i said
[19:23:04] <__adrian> MUST   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the
[19:23:06] <__adrian>    definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
[19:23:08] <Anticom> __adrian: Oh, SHALL seems to be an alias of MUST... i never knew this (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119#section-1)
[19:23:11] <Anticom> I guess you learn every day
