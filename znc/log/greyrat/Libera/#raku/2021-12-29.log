[00:14:45] <lizmat> El_Che: that explains why I needed to wait so long when loading Cro::HTTP::Client for the first time after the update :-)
[00:15:21] <lizmat> El_Che: I think the advantage of arm64 packages is that one wouldn't need to compile Rakudo on those architectures
[00:15:46] <lizmat> and compiling Rakudo on those *is* a barrier when you have less than let's say 1.2G of RAM available
[00:16:02] <lizmat> let alone how long it takes  :-)
[00:17:31] <japhb> It is indeed slow as heck.  I'm curious what target audience you're thinking of, though.  RPi 3 users?
[00:18:41] <japhb> (It compiles just fine -- if slowly -- on a 4 GB RPi 4.  I don't think you can buy an RPi 4 smaller than 2 GB these days, but maybe it was possible in the past.)
[00:19:50] <japhb> Wikipedia says there was a 1 GB RPi 4 at one point

[01:28:55] <El_Che> does adding cpus make the buikd faster?
[01:33:36] <japhb> El_Che: I suspect the answer to that is "yes", but I normally don't widen my builds because on x64 the zef installs are the overall time limiter, and on arm64 I have heat disappation issues
[01:34:33] <El_Che> last wurstion: do rpi usets mainly run raspian or just regular distros? eg on oracle cloud you'd run arm64 ubuntu or oracle linux
[01:35:19] <japhb> Raspbian (32-bit) and Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) are both desktop distros.
[01:35:33] <japhb> They're not very heavy, obviously, but they're certainly not intended for servers.

[03:09:06] <japhb> zef authors: trying to figure out how to deal with intermittent network connectivity when building a huge mess of Raku modules -- at some point the network flakes out just as zef is trying to pull a tarball, and it blows up.
[03:09:31] <japhb> Is there a way to separate the phases and download the tarballs separately from trying to extract/test/install them?
[03:09:51] <japhb> And in particular, to be able to tell (via e.g. exit code) whether the tarball was retrieved successfully?
[03:10:21] <japhb> Because then I can wrap that download in a retry loop ... or batch download when I've got good connectivity, and build later when I'm offline.
[03:17:01] <lizmat> well, there's the --serial option, that tests / installs each module at a time ?
[03:35:08] <japhb> Nah, I really need to *completely* separate download from build.  I'm effectively serializing now, but I think zef runs a download/unpack, assumes it succeeds, and then proceeds with testing, only to have it fail, because there was never a working/complete tarball to unpack.
