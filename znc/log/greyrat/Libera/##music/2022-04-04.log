[15:08:40] <Digit> to know death, dont take shrooms for >2 years, fast for a day, then take several tens of dried fine powdered grams in hot lemon juice.  "legendary dose", "level 5", "omniscience", "i know death", some say.
[15:09:19] <DunceCotus> Digit: oh gord.. how'd you go?
[15:11:38] <Digit> words cannot convey.  omniscience, cant take it all back with you.  "i know death" were my first words to anyone straight after coming out of that trip.  deeply comforting to me, but the look of fright and horror on her face, ho ho.  
[15:12:14] <Digit> anyway, trip reports aside, soffmi muhod started showing up shortly after that.
[15:12:50] <Keter> Did you travel into an alternate universe?
[15:13:04] <Digit> omniscience.
[15:13:21] <Digit> (~and sorta indistinguishable omnipresence too~)
[15:13:50] <Digit> as in, i was all universes.   
[15:14:06] <Digit> and every little everything ever in all
[15:14:26] <DunceCotus> Digit: can you go into detail?
[15:14:40] <Digit> words cannot convey.  you have the steps i took to experience it.  ;)
[15:15:03] <Digit> DunceCotus: frankly, i thought i'd nailed it with my first line about it and was happy to leave it at that.
[15:15:15] <DunceCotus> Digit: last time I had shrooms I think I came up against a wall, or purgatory? it was unpleasant
[15:15:19] <DunceCotus> like inbetween life and death
[15:15:27] <Digit> :)
[15:15:44] <DunceCotus> I do not really want to experience that again
[15:15:58] <Keter> Did you end up in the backrooms?
[15:16:12] <DunceCotus> yeah
[15:16:42] <Digit> yeah, it's not all pleasant hedonistic tickling in accessing everything.   ... and nothing.   the various nothings, are ~interesting~ to experience too.  a similar trepidation likely from experiencing them.
[15:17:12] <DunceCotus> Digit: have you experienced time loops?
[15:17:17] <DunceCotus> how does one resist them
[15:17:34] <DunceCotus> or other loops
[15:17:36] <Digit> all kinda of temporal stuff.  what kind of "time loops" do you mean?
[15:17:49] <DunceCotus> hard to describe
[15:17:56] <DunceCotus> but like sounds looping and shit
[15:18:04] <Digit> idk i have any need to resist them, no compulsive attraction to them, or aversion to them..
[15:18:10] <DunceCotus> that was the worst part
[15:18:26] <DunceCotus> Digit: well I hope you don't experience that
[15:18:40] <DunceCotus> nobody should.. not fun
[15:19:01] <DunceCotus> Digit: I think one way to break out if that happens is to distract yourself
[15:19:06] <Digit> there's a huge part of mindSET that's about allowing, letting go, accepting the witnessing, embracing the experience non-judgementally with humility, ... clinging on to anything could cause pains
[15:19:30] <DunceCotus> Digit: mind you i've not had an OOBE with shrooms, or "breakthrough" experience
[15:19:39] <Digit> yeah, distraction that was kinda my first thought, that it's less about the thing caught in loops of, n more about the all else.
[15:20:07] <Digit> yeah, my legendary trip, sorta shuttled me past that quickly...
[15:20:08] <DunceCotus> Digit: i've seen strange gates though :P
[15:20:29] <DunceCotus> Digit: that's good to hear
[15:20:41] <DunceCotus> cause when you're caught within it can be difficult to conceive of an out
[15:20:48] <DunceCotus> or at least it was for me
[15:22:49] <DunceCotus> Digit: how much memory is there of the legendary trip?
[15:24:18] <Digit> it started coming on strong and fast, as i dashed to the toilet to purge.   clinging to the sink, slumped to the floor, familiar "reality" rapidly asking to be whisked away, and the immensity of what was coming, did evoke some daunted trepidation, some clinging, and i sought to steady and calm my self, to keep myself steady mindSET for the ride, focussed on a drop of water... and in total full all encompassing all enveloping
[15:24:18] <Digit> boundaryless empathy with that drop of water i soon knew it all, where every molecule of it had ever been, and each's entirety of existence and experience, each the whole universe reflected in each part, making springboarding to doing the same for all else, not just the drop of water, easy, and from there, and on and on, soon infinities of immediacy of seeing behind everything...
[15:26:17] <DunceCotus> Digit: :O
[15:26:31] <Digit> this was ... about 20 years ago to the month, iirc.   and even soon after, memories of the experience are fleeting, and... i did well to even retain that i had experience omniscience.  the water droplet focussing, being that early entrypoint path that leads the way to it... just the right speed of dose to level 5 to see the rim enough to point at it when back ashore.  
[15:27:14] <DunceCotus> Digit: crazy
[15:27:30] <DunceCotus> Digit: this stuff is super powerful
[15:27:48] <DunceCotus> especially how you did it
[15:28:19] <DunceCotus> Digit: or maybe you're superpowerful :P
[15:28:41] <DunceCotus> I have not really experienced omniscience, I think I'm all too clinging to my body/ego
[15:28:59] <Digit> that mere little beings such as us, can experience omniscience, was the big take away from that for me.   .... "... holy shit, there must be millions of beings all around the universe experiencing omniscience right now... we're in their consciousness, aware of all this conversation... and all our conversations, all our lives, always..."

[15:30:44] <DunceCotus> Digit: sounds utterly exhausting
[15:31:24] <Digit> i've oft wondered about it, how such experiences are available to us, how it's even possible i mean...   and... then when you consider the computing power of quantum computers over conventional computers, and how they scale, and then how even known aspects of our brains work like quantum computers, and then consider how many qubits we can churn...   one could hypothesise not even needing the connecting to the other brain networks out
[15:31:24] <Digit> there to accomplish such virtualised omniscience... and then considering one /can/ connect to all that too... all the mycelian networks n all the brains we dont even know about..
[15:31:41] <DunceCotus> Digit: but my own research/study/experience has lead me to similar conclusions
[15:32:13] <Digit> yeah, it's good to have the peace from the hubub of eeeeeverything going on in mind.  lol.   i think that's what mushroom yawns are.  
[15:32:40] <DunceCotus> could well be
[15:33:29] <DunceCotus> the seething, writhing, ever-presence of sentience
[15:34:40] <DunceCotus> Digit: I think the mushroom reconfigures our thinking from arborescence to rhizomatic
[15:34:56] <DunceCotus> so we make all sorts of connections between things we never would make in sober mindset

[15:35:07] <Digit> [oh well, lets go there.  the whole camel's in the tent at this point.]  reminds me of my 1st time (and only effective (of all 2 times)) with lsd.  when i was overwhelmed to discover i had arms.  then hours later i discovered i had legs too!   
[15:35:30] <DunceCotus> Digit: must have been quite the shock
[15:36:17] <DunceCotus> Digit: I had a shroom trip where it was like my whole body was just an extension of the 'camera' or visual field as VR goggles
[15:36:34] <Digit> wow, i like that.... reconfigures, from abhorence, to rhizomatic, was my first read of that.  heh, i wonder the etymological link between abhorence and arborial.  n_n
[15:37:35] * Digit loves the focal boundary dissolutions and insights from that alternative combined perspectives
[15:37:49] <DunceCotus> like there's the real thing which is the central block of awareness, sensory "center", then you have organs coming off that
[15:38:17] <DunceCotus> like a glove for this block of awareness
[15:38:25] <DunceCotus> wearing the world
[15:40:01] <Digit> yep, that lsd thing, years of assimilating later, i take it like that, like i was the spark of consciousness, used to itself, as that mere spark of consciousness, suddenly introduced to identifying with being a being with mass, and limbs, these cumbersome things that need tending to.
[15:40:49] <DunceCotus> right
[15:41:18] <DunceCotus> there is a sense the consensus reality is a kind of tool or apparatus
[15:41:48] <DunceCotus> its there for consciousness to produce certain products, perhaps itself
[15:42:15] <Digit> yep, faint whispers of memories of fully getting it, in the legendary trip.  all the ins n outs of it, all the whys, n why nots, the perfections of it to serve its function.
[15:43:17] <DunceCotus> also a sense of, once you've experienced these possibilities of consciousness, there's no going back

[15:44:20] <DunceCotus> Digit: but I think we do mostly repress these experiences 
[15:44:41] <DunceCotus> Digit: also happens with dream experiences
[15:45:17] <DunceCotus> its touching the Real, and by doing so you risk rapid destratification, which can lead to madness, death
[15:45:22] <Digit> autopaoiesis, trans-temporal causality, we're building god, the universe and every ouroboross.  n_n  ... even in every little thing.   life, the universe, and everything; reality; it's not a spectator sport.   "god and marley share a j, just to pass the time of day.  bob tells god of his great visions.  god takes notes and plans revisions."
[15:46:11] <DunceCotus> well sure
[15:46:27] <Digit> recursy tho, that even our repressing these experiences is itself an experience.  like if we're all omniscient consciousness, to enrichen the diversity of experience, there needs a certain amount of ... editing out.  heh.
[15:46:57] <DunceCotus> well it seems like an (small?)infinity is edited out
[15:47:08] <Digit> :) *nods*
[15:47:19] <DunceCotus> but then its like well what is the universe really
[15:47:27] <DunceCotus> its not simply the physical cosmos
[15:47:55] <Digit> "what is the universe really?" sounds like a question worth asking in ##?
[15:48:29] <Digit> and i suspect the answer got back in there, would fit with "it's not simply the physical cosmos".

[15:53:20] <DunceCotus> its an auto-producing substrate
[15:53:33] <DunceCotus> metaphysically auto-producing
[15:54:52] <DunceCotus>  imagine a science with this in mind
[15:55:43] <DunceCotus> right now science proceeds on the discovery angle, "uncovering" truths about reality, or seemingly attempting to take up a passive or purely observant position toward reality
[15:55:52] * Digit likes the socratic first-principles 'yness of it
[15:56:13] <DunceCotus> science will of course never say they have the final truth
[15:56:27] <Digit> in a sence, it's the marriage with art we seek here.
[15:56:32] <DunceCotus> but there also seems to be not that much examination of how science itself effects reality-production
[15:56:42] <Digit> yup.

[15:57:41] <Digit> (to varying extents)
[15:58:18] <DunceCotus> yep
[15:58:48] <Digit> science will do well to unhobble itself from the illusion of the "purely objective outside unimpactful observer".
[15:59:51] <DunceCotus> Digit: I mean quantum physics wave-particle duality stuff seems to imply they've already discovered this

[16:00:25] <DunceCotus> its just it hasn't percolated to all of science, or hasn't been taken as all-impacting as it should be perhaps
[16:02:27] <Digit> and all the entrainments and morphic resonance ... and the apparent/emergent need for /double/ blind experimentation to deepen the elimination of our effects, gosh, why wont we just spectate.,  all that pesky participation getting in the way of our experiments to determine reality, from reality, reality keeps getting in the way!  lol
[16:02:58] <Digit> yeah, well put.  " hasn't been taken as all-impacting as it should be perhaps"
[16:03:04] <DunceCotus> Digit: there's research suggesting that just thought or imagination can affect the experiment, and irrespective of distance from experiment etc. 
[16:03:46] <DunceCotus> I mean the double slit experiment
[16:04:28] <DunceCotus> they can 'observe' and thus collapse the wave function into discretised light rays simply by thinking about this happening in the experiment :P
[16:06:20] <Digit> yep, we've a mountain of expectation re-shaping the way.  and we even had impositional and indoctrinitional mandatory shared expectations, shared perceptions enshrined as belief, hardened as dogma... can be so prickly to present other maps when rigidly narrowed in arrogant ignorant loops.  ... makes me wonder what more wonders we suppress and deny ourselves.
[16:08:28] <Digit> light's so fascinating though.   in this, what a nexus of woops-wow-another-wonder revealing clues into the nature of our universe that are not immediately intuitive to our biological umwelt.  ... like, the thought experiement, of sitting on a photon... light speed being infinite, and yet, all the same moment everywhere, ... how that perspective re-unfolds the universe a new for us...

[23:13:41] <LibertyDillo> Yeah, great that you have transportation
[23:13:51] <LibertyDillo> so you have to put oil in the gas
[23:13:55] <morlog> way better than the wolf scooter I had
[23:14:03] <LibertyDillo> really, wow
[23:14:11] <morlog> no, separate oil reservoir
[23:14:20] <LibertyDillo> ah ok
[23:14:43] <morlog> you have to top off both the gas and oil when you fill it
[23:14:52] <LibertyDillo> right
[23:17:11] <morlog> gas mileage isn't as good but who cares, its about a dollar a day in fuel with all day riding
