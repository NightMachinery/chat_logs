[01:27:14] <causative> there are two other reasons why it's important to have a culture in which it's okay to be wrong - besides encouraging people to admit when they are wrong
[01:28:54] <causative> first, if it's okay to be wrong, it's okay to be uncertain.  Most propositions have a degree of uncertainty associated, and a rational person should admit some level of doubt. Most people are overconfident in most things they believe.
[01:29:48] <causative> the dysfunctional social dynamic whereby if you admit error you are socially punished, is the same dynamic whereby if you admit uncertainty you are socially punished
[01:30:08] <causative> by reversing the taboo on being wrong, we reverse the taboo on being uncertain
[01:30:57] <causative> second - if it's okay to be wrong, then it's okay to learn and explore.  Because when learning and exploring new fields, we are wrong more often.  And this is okay and good; it is the way we grow.

[04:15:12] <audrey> biys: and I was struggling to figure out how a bunch of seventeen year olds sitting on the pavement with slogans has any serious causal relationship with world temperature averages
[04:15:45] <audrey> It seems like a lot of things in our society seem to have causes, but the causal line can´t really be traced all that credibly.
[04:26:55] <biys> did i blog about this already here?  the thing going on in BC?  Fraser Valley AKA Fraser Lake?
[04:27:15] <biys> i already suggested that climate change is a catch all term used to describe not what it suggests
[04:27:36] <biys> it doesn't seem to provide any kind of realistic percetage of recognisable change.
[04:27:53] <biys> all it seems to do is point to the negative impacts of weather phenom
[04:28:09] <biys> if that weather phenom has a significant negative impact it is then classified as "climate change"
[04:28:40] <biys> Fraser Valley was a fucking LAKE
[04:28:47] <biys> that was pumped out in the turn of last century
[04:28:53] <biys> and it's still actively being pumped out to this day
[04:29:16] <biys> for over two decades environmental analysis has suggested that with a significant weather condition it could likely turn the area back into a lake
[04:29:26] <biys> this has been on record for at least two decades
[04:29:39] <biys> but it's quickly generalized as climate change
[04:29:50] <causative> well, the idea is that with more heat in the climate there will be more energy, hence more extreme weather events
[04:30:21] <causative> you can't trace any individual event to global warming, but you can notice an increasing frequency of extreme events
[04:30:48] <biys> the disaster that is fraser valley is not as a result of climate change.  it's a result of teraforming and poor planning
[04:30:54] <causative> it's a matter of statistics, not a "smoking gun"
[04:32:11] <biys> to suggest that all the damage that happend in fraser valley is as a result of climate change is absolute nonse
[04:32:14] <biys> nonsense
[04:32:19] <biys> to even report on that being the case is nonsense
[04:32:45] <causative> well, as I said, you can't trace any *individual* event to global warming
[04:33:13] <causative> only the trend of change in the intensity and frequency of events over time
[04:33:13] <biys> climate change isn't reported as the statistical changes of the climate in any given area
[04:33:35] <causative> bad science reporting usually
[04:33:38] <biys> it's a catch-all term used to describe any environmental condition that has a negative result
[04:33:53] <biys> regardless what caused the negative environmental condition originally
[04:34:11] <biys> same with Texas and the winter storm they had
[04:34:19] <biys> the disaster that was that sitaution wasn't as a result of climate change

[04:35:42] <biys> i'll tell you a story.  there's no code around here that suggests that roof top units need to be fastened down
[04:35:59] <biys> they typically sit on a recessed curb, so it's unlikely they will lift up 10+ inches and fall off the building
[04:36:19] <biys> i've never seen it happen before, but i responded to a situation where a roof top unit was blown off the top of a building
[04:36:40] <biys> just summarize that as a result of the weather?
[04:36:50] <biys> no.  i'd summarize it as a result of a lack of fasteners
[04:37:20] <causative> the causes of a single event can be summarized in many different, non-contradictory ways

[04:42:51] <biys> fair enough

[05:00:54] <audrey> (But there is a lot of truth to this in retrospect)
[05:01:20] <biys> i could see it.  it's where the bleeding hearts of the world unite
[05:02:01] <biys> and i don't mean that in a bad way
[05:02:16] <biys> i just mean it in the way that it is
[05:03:15] <biys> there is definitely a divide.  i see it in the class i'm taking
[05:03:23] <biys> some people can read smoething and get emotionally swept away with it

[06:32:50] <biys> i'm not sure i follow
[06:41:25] <audrey> biys: What I mean is, the defect (insofar as there is one) in the stereotypical «bleeding heart» might not be so much a lack of ability to emotionally regulate, as much as a lack of ability to apply reason to difficult situations.
[06:42:13] <audrey> Because «critical thinking», or whatever you want to call it, is increasingly not part of the toolbox that we equip young people with, at least in the West.
[06:42:50] <audrey> In fact a friend of mine (who occasionally shows up in ##philosophy) turned up his nose once at the notion of «critical thinking» - thought it was problematic because it privileged certain «modes of knowledge» over others.
[06:43:04] <audrey> This struck me as a very ... baffling? thing to say for someone with multiple degrees in philosophical fields.

[07:32:55] <Delf> Belief (religious mental patterns) demand defense for what you believe and want to be true. This puts you on a mission to defend rather than a mission to understand something. Being right to a certain degree is a range of accuracy and probability being attempts at calculating the accuracy. True/false being the threshold for considering something to be true/false
[07:34:02] <Delf> You notice yourself being on these missions and you notice that it's not actually what you want, it's a mental reaction rather than a conscious response. You see what you did wrong, causative.
[07:37:55] <Delf> It takes a lot of time to break mental patterns that like to repeat... to no longer affiliate with a religion does not automagically delete the thought patters that we still harbor. We might even replace the names and affiliate with something else that is supposed to be irreligious but we do it with the same thought patterns... not legit.
[07:40:23] <Delf> If your lucky, you'll notice the problem. Next, you try to run away from it...because it's fucking disgusting and not what you want, at least not anymore. But we're carrying it with us
[07:42:32] <Delf> When someone says I'm wrong, and I don't know what they mean, this peaks my interest to find out where it comes from... is it something I missed about myself or is it something they're projecting. I very much prefer the former, reminds me of being back in a candy shop as a kid.
[07:45:20] <Delf> Pro tip. If you find yourself seething as a result of engaging me... either I'm too stupid and it's taking too much for you to help me to understand... or you're just fucking wrong, too busy denying it and defending yourself and hence cannot notice it.

[07:47:06] <Delf> Emotions say a whole lot about what we hide behind fancy words and faces.
[07:49:34] <causative> Delf, that's all fine, but I would strongly recommend that you use more standard terminology.  You need a word for propositions that a person considers to be true, whether they are religious or otherwise, and that word is "belief"
[07:50:50] <causative> i.e. the word "belief" in modern philosophical usage does *not* indicate any association with religion
[07:50:51] <Delf> But that word is problematic
[07:51:03] <causative> only in your mind
[07:51:55] <causative> you need a word for propositions a person considers true, and English doesn't really have a word for this other than "belief"
[07:51:58] <Delf> There is belief you don't question. There is belief that is based on what you think is most probable and there is belief might be probable.. possible
[07:53:10] <Delf> Only my mind is problematic :P
[07:55:45] <Delf> Why the hell would I let you challenge my belief... before I me? I'll beat you to it!
[07:58:03] <Delf> If belief has relationship with your emotions, you'll defend it, at your own cost even.
[07:59:07] <Delf> If it does not have much if any relationship with your emotions, you'll be willing to work with it... and the third one... you won't care enough to work with it as it's probably useless :P

[23:26:40] <causative> consciousness involves understanding - the complexity is necessary to "correlate together"/"understand" the individual data sorces
[23:26:42] <causative> *sources
[23:27:33] <causative> and the reason these sources are correlated - which is also the way that we practically determine whether someone knows something - is so that we can use the correlated information to guide our actions to achieve our goals
[23:28:16] <causative> so really, what is necessary isn't mere complexity, but goal-orientedness
[23:28:55] <causative> if a system organizes information in such a way that it can act on that information, in such a way that its actions can be interpreted as pursuing some goal, that's consciousness
[23:29:32] <biys> what makes a goal?
[23:29:36] <causative> the goal is what grants meaning to the information; the meaning of the information (to the agent) is the way in which it relates to the goal
[23:30:24] <causative> biys, what we do is we ask whether we can *interpret* a system as pursuing some goal - the goal isn't a single thing we can point to, it's an aspect of an interpretation of the whole system
[23:31:06] <causative> for example, we can say that if we put a mouse in a cage and electrify part of the floor, the actions of the mouse can be interpreted as trying to get away from that section of floor
[23:31:26] <causative> or if we train a neural network to recognize anteaters, the actions of the network can be interpreted as trying to minimize the objective function we gave it
[23:32:57] <causative> the interpretation must include three parts:  what the agent knows, what actions the agent is choosing among, and the goal.  And the interpretation must satisfy the constraint that the actions of the agent are always taken so that what it *believes* to best achieve the goal, is done.
[23:33:39] <causative> this three-part interpretation describes both knowledge and goal, inseparably
[23:33:48] <causative> unified in the middle by the actions the agent takes
[23:33:51] <biys> is a white blood cell conscious?
[23:34:00] <causative> I say yes
[23:34:02] <biys> k
[23:34:14] <causative> consciousness is on a continuum
[23:34:41] <biys> is a plant conscious?
[23:34:47] <causative> yes, same reason
[23:34:49] <biys> vegans hate you
[23:35:04] <causative> a white blood cell has a very small amount of consciousness - it senses and moves, but doesn't know much more than its immediate surroundings
[23:35:10] <causative> the same for a plant
[23:35:29] <causative> it's not inherently immoral to kill a conscious agent - it depends on the amount of consciousness the agent has
[23:35:42] <causative> if the agent only has a very small amount, then the agent has low moral worth
[23:35:47] <biys> someone in coma?
[23:36:09] <causative> well, there we must also consider the impact on the patient's family
[23:36:21] <biys> poor plant family
[23:36:24] <causative> but inherently, for themselves, someone in an unrecoverable coma with no higher brain function does not have inherent moral worth
[23:36:36] <causative> they're effectively already dead
[23:36:45] <biys> fair enough
[23:36:48] <causative> only their bodies continue, which are not the parts of them that carry moral value
[23:38:30] <Atque> causative: That's very declarative to be honest. Most people say consciousness involves subject experiences. It might be the case information-processing systems of different kinds are conscious, but unfortunately there's no way to assess it, so it's a bit useless in my view.
[23:38:51] <causative> Atque, yes, I am speaking of subjective experiences
[23:39:07] <causative> I say that subjective experiences are information that can be used pursuant to the agent's goals
[23:39:27] <causative> information sufficiently correlated to guide the agent's actions towards a goal
[23:39:29] <Atque> causative: Yes, so you ought be saying "I don't know what causes consciousness", not "white blood cell has a very small amount of consciousness".
[23:39:35] *** Quits: betashaft (~betashaft@97-115-34-188.ptld.qwest.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:39:40] <causative> why ought I say that?
[23:40:37] <Atque> causative: Because there's no empirical support for any specific connection between systems of any sort and subject experience. And you may not be able to make observations to support it in general.
[23:41:25] <Atque> causative: Nor is there any convincing theoretical reasons to say systems of specific kinds have subject experience. Chalmer's hard problem is just hard unfortunately.
[23:41:43] <causative> certainly there is empirical support for such a connection; if I see something, and I want to tell you what I see, then I will say what I see.  This connects my subjective experience (sight qualia) to the action I take (describing my sight qualia) via the goal I am seeking.
[23:42:30] <causative> Atque, do you claim that my descriptions of my qualia are completely causally independent of the qualia themselves?
[23:42:40] <causative> that would be quite a coincidence, wouldn't it?
[23:43:36] <Atque> causative: It doesn't. You could program a mac to do that using a classifier in keras and a web camera with the say utility, but it wouldn't tell you whether the computer has subjective experience.
[23:44:39] <biys> i think that goes with what they're saying about the perception of the agents actions.
[23:44:50] <I_Am_M00t> I think there's a mix up between making connections and having conscious experience
[23:44:54] <causative> the classifier wouldn't be doing what my brain is doing - it wouldn't have the full breadth of goals and information
[23:44:56] <I_Am_M00t> whatever the latter means
[23:45:20] <causative> Atque, the classifier would be pursuing a very narrow and simple type of goal, so it wouldn't have the same kind of consciousness as my own mind
[23:45:29] <causative> it would have some type of consciousness, but not the same structure
[23:45:50] <biys> so does the classification simply in itself mean consciousness exists?
[23:45:59] <causative> Atque, now answer my question
[23:46:05] <causative> do you claim that my descriptions of my qualia are completely causally independent of the qualia themselves?
[23:46:11] <Atque> causative: It could very well have goals, for example it might developed to optimise playing some game. Evolutionary scientists say animals are similar (they have heuristics and bodies to mate, avoid disease, feed, drink and so forward).
[23:46:24] <I_Am_M00t> what if you model it to increase the chance of Earth and its ecosystems surviving?
[23:46:39] <Atque> causative: But the animal seems conscious and the computer does not, so the information processing approach seems unconvincing in my view.
[23:47:06] <causative> I think you cannot rely on naive intuitions in this subject Atque , so you cannot simply say the computer isn't conscious
[23:47:09] <causative> that's something to find out, not to assume
[23:47:17] <causative> answer my question
[23:48:02] <Atque> causative: What else can you rely on. There's no signal a computer, tree or even ourselves have subjective experiences - it's private by nature.
[23:48:02] <I_Am_M00t> oof
[23:49:00] <causative> there are other facts we can rely on.  answer my question
[23:49:05] <Atque> causative: But you cannot find it out. Private experiences are available to agents beyond the agent having the experience.
[23:49:12] <Atque> * are not
[23:49:18] <biys> shit.  according to that definition the act of the classification in itself, in the scenario itself, is an idea of conscuousness.

[23:50:48] <Atque> causative: You're not very clear.
[23:51:05] <causative> I quoted it twice while asking you to answer it, now three times
[23:51:08] <biys> i think you have a situation where the observer is observing their own consciousness
[23:51:23] <biys> so my questioning of your subjective experience is completely reasonable
[23:51:29] <Atque> causative: That'd require committing to that subjective experience is divisible into qualia. Lots of philosophers don't think they are.
[23:51:30] <biys> according to your original position
[23:51:45] <biys> it very well could be innacurate
[23:51:48] <causative> Atque, I'm not asking about lots of philosophers, I'm asking about you
[23:51:48] <biys> and not based in any truth
[23:52:21] <causative> that's still not an answer
[23:52:45] <biys> i get it
[23:52:49] <biys> i'm just saying
[23:52:51] <biys> i hear what you're saying
[23:53:38] <Atque> causative: Well, if someone is noncommittal about ghosts, you probably don't expect them to answer questions about what ghosts do. Asking your question is misleading, because it requires committing to that qualia exists. It follows the same as the Mary is the colour scientist in a black and white room type argument.
[23:53:58] <causative> Atque, do you commit to that qualia exist, or not?
[23:54:28] <causative> you can't use that as an excuse for not answering unless you indeed do *not* commit that qualia exist, and you haven't said that
[23:54:52] <Atque> causative: I don't think qualia exist.
[23:55:02] <causative> okay.  Then let me reword the question
[23:55:17] <causative> do you claim that my descriptions of my subjective experiences are completely causally independent of the subjective experience itself?
[23:55:45] <causative> I think you already indicated you think subjective experiences exist
[23:55:54] <I_Am_M00t> sorry to jump in, but what does that even mean?
[23:56:05] <biys> what does what mean?
[23:56:15] <causative> er, no, you simply said "most people" think consciousness involves subjective experiences
[23:56:23] <I_Am_M00t> isn't it the same issue, that it requires that the other person commits to assumptions they may not agree with?
[23:56:40] <causative> I don't care about what "most people" think, I care about what you think. But assuming that is your position as well, you shouldn't have a problem answering the revised question.
[23:56:58] <biys> i think there is a difference in whos interpretation it is
[23:57:03] <causative> <Atque> causative: That's very declarative to be honest. Most people say consciousness involves subject experiences.
[23:57:04] <biys> as the observer and the agent...
[23:57:08] <Atque> causative: So you think conscious experience are a billiard ball? It bumps your brain in some way that makes your fingers type about consciousness?
[23:57:11] <biys> or as the observer, not the agent
[23:58:01] <causative> Atque, if it's not something like that, then wouldn't it have to be complete and total coincidence that I am apparently able to accurate describing my subjective experiences?
[23:58:12] <Atque> causative: Maybe, it would be more sensible to suggest there is just one underlying system and somehow it is a property or emergent from it.
[23:58:14] <causative> *able to accurately describe
[23:59:13] <causative> Atque, moreover, don't we talk about causation within our consciousness *all the time*?  Is it not natural to say that I moved my hand to catch the ball, because I had the subjective experience of seeing the ball?
[23:59:32] <causative> is it not natural to say that I described the goose I saw, as a result of subjectively seeing that goose?
[23:59:57] *** Quits: Pixi (~Pixi@user/pixi) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:59:59] <causative> sure, perhaps it is one underlying system
