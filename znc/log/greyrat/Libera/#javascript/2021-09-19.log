[00:08:12] <justsomeguy> Is there a built-in method like filter, but for strings? I'd like to write something like filter(x => isUpper x, "Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle") which should result in "TASER".

[00:08:46] <justsomeguy> Sorr, the result sould be "TSER" in this case. Sloppy typing on my part.
[00:11:36] <justsomeguy> I guess I can split the string into an array of characters, and then use Array.prototype.filter().
[00:19:48] <ljharb> justsomeguy: yes, that's the way to do it
[00:20:04] <ljharb> justsomeguy: i guess you could use regex but that won't work well for unicode stuf

[00:34:21] <ljharb> !this @ Gamara
[00:34:22] <jellobot> Gamara, A function call of the form `a.b()` calls the function with `this` being the value of `a`; in a call of the form `f()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function wasn't defined in strict mode. Note that arrow functions and functions produced by `Function.prototype.bind` ignore the passed `this` value. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[00:34:32] <ljharb> Gamara: iow, if you're using OOP, then you have to use `this`.

[02:42:42] <earendel> n> 'use strict'; global.x={a:1}; var x={b:4}; [x, global.x]

[02:43:34] <KDev> https://jsfiddle.net/kwvtLpd4/ *
[02:44:31] <earendel> im pretty sure var x was module scoped. as all code in node was wrapped into the function(module, exports, require, __dirname, __filename, blah) { } wrapping function.
[02:44:48] <sheetjs> you can test this
[02:45:16] <earendel> so in not strict mode x=4; would make x a global var.. but var x would make it only global to the module.
[02:45:18] <earendel> i did.
[02:45:23] <earendel> and its not the case.
[02:45:26] <sheetjs> try `<script>var x = 3;</script><script>console.log(x);</script>`
[02:45:30] <earendel> so i wonder if that has been changed.
[02:45:46] <sheetjs> the difference is the bundler construct introduces a function
[02:46:11] <sheetjs> the equivalent is var x = 3; (function() { var y = 4; })(); // y is not leaked
[02:46:13] <earendel> sry in strict mode x=4 would of course fail.
[02:46:38] <KDev> I thought var is bad to use?
[02:47:18] <sheetjs> var is part of the language.  modern code generally should use let/const
[02:47:53] <earendel> and that has been always the case. nevermind. i cant test it now. but i believe var x was not equal to global.x once .. not in node.
[02:48:05] <sheetjs> n> var x = 3; global.x
[02:48:06] <jellobot> (okay) 3
[02:48:09] <earendel> nevermind.
[02:48:11] <sheetjs> n> "use strict"; var x = 3; global.x
[02:48:12] <jellobot> (okay) 3
[02:48:26] <sheetjs> you might be confusing var and let
[02:48:30] <sheetjs> n> let x = 3; global.
[02:48:31] <jellobot> (fail) SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[02:48:31] <sheetjs> n> let x = 3; global.x
[02:48:32] <jellobot> (okay) undefined
[02:48:59] <sheetjs> node predates let
[02:49:13] <earendel> what let.
[02:49:24] <earendel> thats another topic.
[02:49:37] <earendel> we can talk about let of course.
[02:49:42] <earendel> lol
[02:49:59] <sheetjs> html
[02:51:33] <sheetjs> so based on testing, it seems the right way to get the full url is to create a new A element, set its href, then read it back

[08:58:49] <systemfault> It's sloppy code.
[08:59:04] <systemfault> Use .closest(selector) instead of .parentElement.parentElement.parentElement
[08:59:57] <systemfault> For example, if you ever add a wrapper div to change the styling a bit, then the code would break
[09:00:19] <systemfault> Because you would then need to do: .parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement
[09:00:34] <spinningcat> closestSelector wont let me select upper parent,
[09:00:49] <systemfault> .closest(someSelectorHere)

[10:46:19] <earendel> systemfault: what's .closest()?
[10:47:37] <systemfault> More or less a "reverse" querySelector, it finds the first matching ancestor of an element
[10:48:22] <earendel> cool
[10:48:39] <systemfault> For example, if you have a node that is an input element and you want the form it's in... you can do myNode.closest('form')
[10:49:23] <earendel> welly well. thx
[10:52:03] <earendel> are there more of such? like for siblings or what do i know
[10:54:30] <earendel> closest sounds as if it could search in several directions. does it return only the closest parent (single) element?
[10:55:31] <earendel> !mdn closest
[10:55:32] <jellobot> earendel, Element.closest() - The closest() method traverses the Element and its parents (heading toward the document root) until it finds a node that matches the provided selector string. Will return itself or the matching ancestor. If no such element exists, it returns null. https://mdn.io/closest
[10:55:35] <ljharb> it only goes up

[15:09:55] <no_gravity> It would be nice to get the right spelling directly from the match.
[15:10:36] <no_gravity> Without you still need to do translation via a translation table. Which makes for additional code and the list of brands is stored in two places in the codebase. Ugly.

[19:18:31] <ThePendulum> but given you are considering haproxy I'm not sure what your use case is, that will make all the difference. both are well established, but as a generic web server I'd think nginx has more relevant documentation and support

[22:54:27] <wroathe> naeluh: The correct way is to have a separate event handler registered for pointermove that just updates pointer X and Y variables somewhere where your scroll event handler can access them.

[23:02:22] <sept> Hi, I want to return a string at the end of my .then promise chain. When I do a console.log(myPromiseChainingFunction) it prints 'undefined', even though I am returning a string in the last .then() function. Does this mean I need to return the value after the .catch() part?
[23:02:39] *** Joins: xb0o2 (~xb0o2@user/xb0o2)
[23:03:15] <sept> In other words, the function doesn't return anything in the promise chain?
[23:03:21] <sept> Only after?
[23:04:08] <systemfault> Not enough info to help here.
[23:04:24] <systemfault> Do you actually return the promise chain from the function

[23:10:41] <systemfault> Add the return keyword at line 8 ?
[23:10:48] <systemfault> It's basic programming

[23:14:16] <sept> systemfault: Ok, so now the promise is being returned, but the string is not being printed from the returning function. Is this an "await" issue?
[23:14:23] *** Quits: Brumaire_ (~quassel@81-64-14-121.rev.numericable.fr) (Quit: ran away)
[23:14:40] <systemfault> The resulting string is inside a promise
[23:14:54] <systemfault> you can do .then to access it
[23:15:25] <systemfault> async/await is just magic syntax for promises
[23:16:44] <sept> systemfault: Access it with a .then() when I call it? Or, do I need to do something more inside my function definition?
[23:16:45] <systemfault> If you were async it though... that code would be a LOT cleaner.
[23:17:37] <systemfault> encryptString('', '').then(result => {})
[23:18:10] <systemfault> If you're in an async function then you can do: const result = await encryptString('', '');
[23:19:14] <sept> systemfault: So, if I wanted to make things cleaner, you suggest not using .then() chaining? Would that mean I would be using 'await's inside the function definition?
[23:20:09] <sept> Or, do you mean using 'await' outside the function definition?
[23:20:35] <sept> Or both...
[23:20:39] <systemfault> "await" unpacks the value inside a promise but it can only be done in the context of an "async function"
[23:22:59] <sept> systemfault: So if I understand you, I can leave the .then() chaining inside my function definition, but use async await to unwrap the promise and get to the string inside?
[23:23:41] <systemfault> yes
[23:23:59] <sept> systemfault: Thanks for the advice. Much appreciated.

[23:51:38] <sept> My understanding is that the function should be returning a Promise object. So, I guess I'm not using 'async' in the proper way...
[23:52:21] *** Joins: haycon (~haycon@84.215.37.126)
[23:53:12] <ljharb> sept: it is. But at the top level you can’t use await, you have to use .then
[23:55:09] <sept> ljharb: What do you mean by "top level" is? Doesn't this mean I can't use 'async' for this function? or do I need to add some .then() somewhere in the definition, or when I call it?
[23:55:52] <ljharb> sept: i mean the top scope of the file
[23:56:26] <ljharb> sept: you can't await the promise returned. you need to do `const promise = encryptString(whatever); promise.then((result) => { /* rest of the program */ });`
[23:56:44] <ljharb> sept: `await` is just sugar for a promise .then, and you can only use it inside an async function, or at the top level of native ESM.
