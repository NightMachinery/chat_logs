[16:46:30] <wink> has anyone written a clojure web app without clojurescript recently? I'm mostly asking because I've mostly been building "old school web apps" with server-rendered frontend and/or a REST api tucked on at like /api/ - but not API first (+dedicated frontend in whatever lang) for a while.
[16:47:12] <wink> that's not a real question, but more like... what do you do, api first, api as second-class citizen or something differnt?
[16:49:55] <goodger> wink: I did mine with liberator and its responses to HTTP queries are different if the client requests HTML vs EDN/etc
[16:50:38] <wink> didn't know that name, thanks. I've only used noir in the past
[16:50:50] <wink> and I want to rewrite something soon.
[16:53:20] <goodger> it might have become unusable or replaced by something better documented since I gave up on my dreams
[16:53:34] <goodger> so you should probably shop around for alternatives to it
[17:01:30] <wink> I mean I guess I should just try to rewrite the bare bones framework with a few routes with noir and some big change and then see if I like it
[17:01:45] <wink> this is not a huge thing, but might as well rearchitect to have a proper api this time
[17:04:18] <Para> There was some other relatively new backend-rendering Clojure web app as well.
[17:04:27] <Para> Can't remember its name though, it was some non-word.
[17:06:48] <goodger> libreoffice writer?
[17:07:02] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I am using clojurescript for frontend, but front and back are completely decoupled. Back is api first built with luminus +services. Not that I know much on the topic tho.
[17:09:05] <ToxicFrog> Last time I did server-side rendering I just used Compojure + Hiccup for rendering, although my most recent project does client-side

[20:08:19] <Para> It used to be that one would slap normalize.css, some grid system, bootstrap/mui before anything else, for example.
[20:10:23] <ridcully> i basically only do web-uis for internal stuff.  according to the recent "state of css" tailwind is still everybodies darling

[20:15:52] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Ok, so something like a re-frame for css that is non-interop clojurescript does not exists?
[20:16:43] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I started doing my frontend in pure css, not css-in-cljs, but I am not so sure that was a god idea now. So I was wondering what the options were
[20:17:01] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Para: Let me know if you get up to speed ;)
[20:17:21] <ridcully> garden (?) is a lib for css
[20:17:55] <ridcully> what you basically get is SASS etc. on steroids.
[20:19:51] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I saw that one, I need to do a lot more research on the topic tho. But that is a css generator, right? Doesn't that mean than rather writing css I would be writing cljs? Other than that, is not like css-in-cljs.
[20:20:48] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I have no idea what I am saying. I was going to do some research and ask further down the line, but since the topic came up...
[20:21:13] <Para> ridcully: we have a (sort of) in-house adaptation of garden, in fact

[21:11:10] <tatsumaru> hey guys, can someone please say in what way has prolog influenced clojure?
[21:11:41] <manicennui> core.logic?
[21:11:56] <manicennui> I don't know about the language more generally.
[21:12:41] <selfsymmetric-mu> tatsumaru: There are two references in History of Clojure. The first is simply that Rich Hickey had played with Prolog, the second is is core.logic.
[21:13:57] <tatsumaru> I see, thanks
[21:15:46] <selfsymmetric-mu> my pleasure
[21:16:16] <tatsumaru> also while on the topic of declarative programming, is it worth learning the reactive programming paradigm for clojure?
[21:16:59] <sobel> tatsumaru: i think that might be 3 separate questions
[21:17:02] <selfsymmetric-mu> tatsumaru: Depends on your goals, but I think it's a worthy model for career programmers. 
[21:17:34] <sobel> agreed that reactive programming is an asset to a career programmer
[21:17:42] <selfsymmetric-mu> For Clojure specifically, well, it's useful if you're writing reagent apps in ClojureScript. re-frame is good here, and has a good reactive programming tutorial.
[21:18:05] <tatsumaru> selfsymmetric-mu: I am not a career programmer, I am learning clojure to write my own apps, possibly a startup at some point
[21:19:03] <selfsymmetric-mu> tatsumaru: Oh okay! Well, I don't know of a better Clojure frontend framework than re-frame, and that's reactive.
[21:20:16] <selfsymmetric-mu> Reactivity is everywhere in the front end because it's natural that the components you see would react to changing data.
[21:21:04] <sobel> writing a frontend without a reactive toolkit/language is a lot of extra effort
[21:22:08] <selfsymmetric-mu> Yeah, I think it's worth it. Happy to answer questions about re-frame if you have any.
[21:22:32] <tatsumaru> re-frame looks cool, they say they are better than Elm and I thought Elm was cool
[21:23:20] <selfsymmetric-mu> Not sure what happened to Elm. I used it once, it worked for me. Then they said they were moving away from FRP, and then there was some community drama.
[21:23:56] <Para> A few friends of mine were super hyper about Elm as well.
[21:23:58] <sobel> as a reasonably comfortable clojure user, i still aspire to get my front end skills/product upgraded to cljs. the last time i jumped into emacs+CIDER my laptop tried to leave the runway (emacs side of CIDER was murdering the CPU each REPL command) but i'm on a fresh new machine now
[21:24:10] <Para> Then they did a project and now one of them is in fact a diehard Java programmer ?_?
[21:24:15] <selfsymmetric-mu> With re-frame you can continue to use Clojure, so that's nice.
[21:24:25] <Solid> creator has a god complex (and is using it wrong!)
[21:24:33] <Solid> though purescript is the better elm anyways
[21:24:58] <tatsumaru> I don't know much about that, but IMO you are not supposed to change the core values of a language, better to start a new language instead 
[21:25:00] <Para> re-frame IMHO is what one would eventually end up doing with reagent anyways
[21:25:07] <sobel> if i weren't headed toward cljs i'd definitely be looking harder at purescript or typescript
[21:25:16] <selfsymmetric-mu> Para: That's exactly what happened to me.
[21:25:30] <selfsymmetric-mu> I started writing an architecture and was like, hm, better to borrow one.
[21:25:41] <selfsymmetric-mu> Let someone else make all my mistakes for me.
[21:26:03] <selfsymmetric-mu> The transition was easy, it's definitely more powerful, and I can be confident in it scaling.
[21:26:07] <sobel> speaking of better to borrow, Vertx is tearing it *up* with the reactive library ecosystem
[21:26:35] <selfsymmetric-mu> I rammed a ton of events through that system (thousands per second)? It didn't skip a beat, and only chugged a bit if I opened the debug panel.
[21:27:14] <sobel> selfsymmetric-mu: that's incredibly encouraging to hear
[21:27:45] <selfsymmetric-mu> Yeah, that was good. I told myself I'd migrate to Rust/Wasm if I needed more oomph but it hasn't happened yet.
[21:28:38] <sobel> webgl or webgpu or whatever it's called pretty much mitigates all my needs to use rust/wasm
[21:29:03] <sobel> that said, i'm enthralled with prospects of several existing apps being able to port to wasm pretty seamlessly, and some that already have
[21:29:24] *** Quits: tatsumaru (~tatsumaru@82.147.131.155) (Quit: Leaving.)
[21:29:44] <selfsymmetric-mu> Yeah, hackers are doing good work in the browser, saving us all from writing JS.
[21:30:08] <sobel> like, if my next dev environment stars postgresql & a couple other elements of my stack running in wasm under chrome, i don't think i'll be mad about it
[21:30:28] <Para> Would it be timely to make a GraalVM->JS port of log4j
[21:30:34] <sobel> ahahaha
[21:30:34] <selfsymmetric-mu> Yeah it lets me get away with being an inveterate backend programmer.
[21:30:48] <selfsymmetric-mu> Kind of how Rust was my excuse to not learn modern C++ idioms.
[21:30:52] <sobel> selfsymmetric-mu: even more than ClojureScript and WebSQL already does
[21:30:59] <Para> (I just noticed I have cargo installed on my home PC, whyyyyy)
[21:31:07] <Para> I should wipe this thing.
[21:31:24] <sobel> i figured C++ would be my excuse not to learn modern C++ idioms but Rust works just as well =)
[21:31:35] <selfsymmetric-mu> I cannot figure out the right way to use Rust on NixOS.

[21:31:45] <selfsymmetric-mu> Nix and rustup compete for usecases.
[21:32:15] <selfsymmetric-mu> sobel: My C++ knowledge: I know the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern exists, and I don't want to learn it.
[21:32:51] <sobel> yeah, that's a perfect example of why modern C++ idioms are a hard yikes from me
[21:33:20] <selfsymmetric-mu> It's impressive that C++ programmers can do ANYTHING but how they do it is completely different from anyone else. It is a dark magick.
[21:34:04] <sobel> i respect their curious ways because they work but do agree with the policies of keeping their magick out of the linux kernel and postgresql
[21:34:24] <sobel> ...like i agree with keeping cats out of the OR
[21:35:11] <sobel> C++ was my first OO. it was neat, and i seem to recall going to some effort to procure djgpp when everyone else was cfront'n
[21:35:49] <sobel> got my shop hooked on C++ at least as a better C
