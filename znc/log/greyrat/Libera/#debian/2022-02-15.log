[05:51:40] <johnfg> The desktop update app will inform me there are updates available, and the only option I see, is to update & restart.  But if I select that, all that seems to happen is a restart, and no updates.
[05:51:45] <johnfg> This is only for me since bullseye, as I've always updated with apt update; apt [full]-upgrade.

[06:21:20] <somiaj> johnfg: might be some polkit issue with the app being able to upgrade. Though maybe the upgrade is happening in the background and it is just informing you to restart. I personally just do this all form the command line with apt, so don't know the workings of such desktop tools

[15:30:35] <shtrb> if you shrink hexchat to a small box (few lines visible), someone sends a message while you focus on a different app, hexchat messages will "vanish" until you scroll up / down(even if there is enough space to show them)
[15:30:48] <shtrb> if you move back to full screen it works fine
[15:31:33] <shtrb> I have seen it in other apps (pidgin) , hence I believe it's gtk issue and not a pure hexchat bug

[15:36:00] <Haohmaru> ..with the scrolling i was affected in earlier debians, i never put hexchat maximized
[15:37:48] <Haohmaru> there's also a glitch when you switch between a hexchat window (any one, could channel or query) and you switch to the status window - right before it draws the status window - it redraws the previous window in a glitchy way that appears as if some new event happened right then
[15:37:54] *** Joins: Fausto (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum)
[15:38:06] <Haohmaru> that is, the old window contents jump up right before the switch
[15:38:12] <Haohmaru> which is highly annoying
[15:38:20] <CaCode> I am a novice but would it be possible to run hexchat from gdb and see what exactly is causing it to vanish?
[15:38:37] <CaCode> maybe it's not a problem with gtk but just not using gtk properly?
[15:38:39] <shtrb> if you know gtk enough you would
[15:39:15] <Haohmaru> gtk.. it's been gaining negative points in my book
[15:39:44] <CaCode> Haohmaru, don't be so quick to blame gtk, it may be just how hexchat uses gtk
[15:39:52] <Haohmaru> raster fonts don't work in hexchat from debian11, at least they are listed, but they render as empty
[15:39:54] <CaCode> plenty of gtk apps that dont have that bug
[15:40:11] <Haohmaru> nah, the font issue is gtk/pango/harfbuzz afaiu
[15:40:14] <Haohmaru> and i'm mad

[18:24:02] <jelly> you might look at the contents of journal with journalctl, to see which service/tool generated most of it

[18:24:48] <shtrb> That is a bold thing to say
[18:24:57] <jelly> the format is different
[18:25:22] <shtrb> If journal is corrupted you lost all , if syslog file get corrupted you loose few lines

[18:26:20] <Rohambili> Wow Thats a lot of thingy most of it miniupnpnd
[18:28:01] <shtrb> journalctl is easier to work with in some flows vs the default rsyslog config (like get me stuff form X boots for example, or to get stuff for a specific unit, when we need to have such access we used to store data in dbs and search in side them , as rsyslog can send data to dbs without too much hassle ) , systemd's journal doesn't suffer from the dreaded 1K message limitation (that syslog over network have)

[20:03:08] <UrielCorinthian> Good evening! I have a question that I really should know the answer to after so many years of using Linux at home. But, I've not REALLY needed to bother with it too much until now. Short version: how do I mount an ext4 partition (using fstab) so that a specific user and/or group can have read & write permissions on it (i.e. not just root has access to it)?
[20:05:01] *** Joins: digitalD (~duane@c-73-153-52-12.hsd1.co.comcast.net)
[20:05:26] <UrielCorinthian> I've tried uid and gid, but this isn't actually available to ext4 partitions by the looks of it. I've changed the permissions on the mountpoint, but the moment the mount happens, the mountpoint is just root:root
[20:05:33] *** Quits: Fauve_bis (~Fauve@user/fauve) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:05:53] <UrielCorinthian> I need this particular mount to be accessible by www-data, so I'm hoping for at least root:www-data

[20:09:41] <UrielCorinthian> sussudio, yes, I've seen that, but it's kind of vague and I'm not sure where to look for further info on how to implement that. It just says "allow a user to mount", which I believe means it would give a user the right to mount that particular device (i.e. ordinary non-root user can issue mount -a and that device would mount). But I need it to auto-mount at boot and be accessible to www-data immediately
[20:10:37] <jhutchins> UrielCorinthian: Have a look at the UID, GID, and mask options.
[20:12:05] <UrielCorinthian> jhutchins, but uid and gid don't seem to be available for ext4...

[20:16:02] <jhutchins> UrielCorinthian: That probably only refers to file creation anyway/
[20:17:16] <jhutchins> UrielCorinthian: The whole concept of UID/GID and file access control is pretty basic in Unix.
[20:17:55] <UrielCorinthian> Attempting to add uid=33,gid=33 or uid=gid=33 to fstab, simply gives me a "wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock" when I execute mount -a
[20:18:19] <jhutchins> UrielCorinthian: What are the permissions of the files/folders within the mount once it's mounted as root?
[20:19:02] <jhutchins> UrielCorinthian: Unfortunately that could be a simple matter of the wrong order or combination of options.

[20:24:40] <UrielCorinthian> fstab line I was trying most recently, is: /dev/mapper/secret	/mnt/datastore	ext4	defaults,uid=gid=33	0	0
[20:25:22] <shtrb> UrielCorinthian, as ext parttion have proper permissions you should be having something along the lines of :UUID=doo-bar /var           ext4    uid=xx,gid=yy,user,rw,umask=000        0       2
[20:25:42] <UrielCorinthian> chown does work, but like I said, I need that to happen automatically

[20:29:07] <UrielCorinthian> I also found a lot of discussion on this topic, but nowhere do I see conclusive results...

[20:30:01] <UrielCorinthian> jhutchins, but the chown can't be permanent, because at shutdown, the device will be unmounted again, and when the system boots, it will have root permissions again, because fstab mounts as root. Then I'd have to issue a manual chown again...
[20:30:18] <UrielCorinthian> But I'll verify that quickly. Let me mount, chown and reboot
