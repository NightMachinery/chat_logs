[00:05:01] <__adrian> puff: that's a farily framework-specific thing
[00:05:39] <__adrian> most of the major ones do, though i'm not that familiar with using them
[00:06:29] <puff> In general I'm talking about scripts that generate a lot of boilerplate.  Save some typing.
[00:06:40] <__adrian> yes, i did understand your question
[00:07:03] <puff> Ah, I see.
[00:07:22] <puff> You meant that they tend to be tightly coupled to a given framework.  Are there any that aren't?

[00:09:57] <__adrian> php is not opinionated enough, as a language, to know what boilerplate you need
[00:10:53] <puff> AHa
[00:11:22] <__adrian> https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial   might interest you
[00:11:38] <puff> I suspect I'm going to end up writing what I want, from scratch, and then I'll show it to you, and then you'll say "Why the hell did you write that when xyzzy already does the same thing?"
[00:11:39] <__adrian> or, a framework might interest you  ;)
[00:11:41] <puff> :-)
[00:11:47] <puff> Thanks.
[00:11:58] <__adrian> yeah, this is not to say you should go write everything from scratch.
[00:12:01] <da_wunder> puff: most of the frameworks like Symfony etc, have support for that
[00:12:14] <__adrian> start with composer. find existing, well-used packages that do the things you need.
[00:12:34] <puff> I was talking about this a week or two ago, I think.  I wrote some tools in another language that I really liked, in part because they didn't come with a way of life built in.

[00:15:38] <puff> Anyone familiar with both Intellij IDEA (for Java) and PhpStorm?
[00:15:43] <puff> da_wunder: Thanks.
[00:16:01] <da_wunder> puff: I have used phpstorm for years
[00:16:23] <puff> I took a look at Intellij's non-java versions a few years back and they weren't nearly as useful as the java version, I'm wondering if they got better.
[00:16:35] <da_wunder> and really that intellij idea is the the "main" IDE there - you have all phpstorm features on that via plugin
[00:16:38] <__adrian> arash: you'd need to start with Pdo::MYSQL_ATTR_LOCAL_INFILE
[00:16:46] <puff> da_wunder: I'm aware.
[00:17:00] <__adrian> from there you'd still have to make sure mysql itself is set up appropriately
[00:17:01] <da_wunder> puff: and they're using java because it's cross platform
[00:17:10] <puff> da_wunder: Not the point.
[00:17:19] <__adrian> https://php.net/ref.pdo-mysql
[00:17:39] <da_wunder> puff: so what is your point?
[00:17:49] <__adrian> puff: this is a "well try it and see" question  :)
[00:17:57] <puff> da_wunder: My point is, I found IDEA very powerful and useful for java development.  When I tried the python and PHP versions, a lot of the more important features didn't really work, which made it a lot less useful for me.  But that was several years back.
[00:18:27] <arash> __adrian, thank you
[00:18:36] <__adrian> no one can tell you what you like. try it out and see if you like it.
[00:19:00] <puff> It's not about what I like, it's about how the support for the different languages compares, hence my initial question.
[00:19:17] <da_wunder> puff: so you really need to check those again - because there has been multiple versions since you last tried those - and really it's _your_ choice what to use
[00:20:14] <__adrian> then ask on a phpstorm channel. they were #idea-users on freenode; don't know what's going on now.
[00:21:27] <puff> __adrian: aha, thanks.
[00:21:53] <__adrian> np
[00:23:00] <biberu> puff: fwiw, you should be comparing ruby to php, not ror to php
[00:23:02] <puff> Looks like there's an #idea-users here, not as populous, but I'll ask there.
[00:23:22] <puff> biberu: I'm not really intersted in comparing them, was just trying to explain what I'm looking for.
[00:23:47] <biberu> yeah, i understand, it's just that one is a language and one is a framework
[00:24:05] <puff> biberu: I'm aware of that, it's not really relevant.
[00:24:37] <puff> biberu:  Many years ago I wrote something somewhat similar to RoR's scaffolding scripts, for java. I found it very useful.  Rather than try to explain what I wrote, I hoped it would be faster/easier to just ask for something similar to RoR scaffolding scripts, only for php.
[00:24:59] <biberu> sure it is, imagine that you asked the same question about ruby, it's too broad
[00:25:33] <puff> biberu: I'd have to know what php scripts/tools to compare to RoR's scaffold-generating scripts in order to ask that question.
[00:25:52] <puff> biberu: But assuming there are some, and assuming they're widely known, it'd pretty much be the same question.

[00:27:32] <biberu> i can only repeat myself :)
[00:27:34] <puff> E.g. I could say "there are lots of java MVC frameworks, are there similar frameworks for PHP?" and the question makes sense, even though most java MVC frameworks run on top of the servlet API in Java, while PHP generally runs as an apache module.
[00:28:45] <biberu> except that question compares framework to framework
[00:29:17] <puff> biberu: You seem fixated on something here, but I'm not sure what it is.
[00:29:48] <biberu> was just mentioning that you're comparing apples to oranges
[00:29:54] <puff> Nope, but thanks.
[00:30:12] <puff> I'm not *comparing* anything, I'm asking for advice/pointers towards possible solutions to my problem.
[00:30:18] <__adrian> puff: this is the same thing i explained when i answered your question
[00:30:46] <__adrian> but, since that seemed to answer the question, i think we can leave it behind now

[19:45:55] <stenno> wasn't that called 'psf' or something?
[19:46:25] <stenno> apparently not
[19:46:40] <__adrian> half the "why not" addresses the wrong question
[19:46:53] <stenno> SPL
[19:46:54] <__adrian> the other half simply raises a different "well why not" question
[19:48:06] <__adrian> for starters, they weren't asked directly, and acknowledge their own lack of understanding of the process
[19:48:42] <__adrian> DS is an excellent (and comprehensive) solution; accepting this RFC would only serve to block it from ever being part of core.
