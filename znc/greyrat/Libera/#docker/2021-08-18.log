[00:03:02] <ada_> foo: there are a few strategies you could use, one of them is to put your modules folder into a volume at runtime so its persisted to disk
[00:03:16] <ada_> foo: another strategy is to use a separate image, but if your modules change you'd need to rebuild the image
[00:03:38] <ada_> foo: the "mount a dir for the modules folder" is probably the cheapest in terms of bandwidth used & storage

[00:13:01] <gooble_gobble> tabakhase, is there a true dind dockerfile you can reccomend? ill try to retrofit it for centos
[00:13:37] <tabakhase> gooble_gobble just straight up docker:dind from the hub? :P
[00:14:45] <foo> ada_ / tabakhase - I'm in this loop of getting several errors of python packages missing. Is there any shorthand way to drop into the container that results from docker build and simply do "pip install ____" ? I sometimes have done this but I can't get into it if it's trying to start a python process that requires the package.
[00:15:07] <foo> I'm looking for a shorthand quick-and-dirty fix right now, I've got a time sensitive / bandwidth limitation I'm working with, haha.
[00:15:07] <ada_> you have to run the container, but once it's running you can 'docker exec' into a shell
[00:15:43] <tabakhase> foo the build prints the id of the prev layer, those can be used directly ((unless your using buildX i guess))
[00:16:09] <foo> tabakhase: ohhhh. so I can do your hack right now.
[00:16:12] <foo> Of course...
[00:16:13] * foo tries
[00:16:55] <tabakhase> and i guess, "dont build until youre there" is another thing ada tried to explain above -  think using docker as runtime for "python" opposed to "building a myapp image"
[00:18:43] <ada_> yeah and if you were so inclined you could even more your build process up to something like github actions or dockerhub autobuilds if you didn't want to have to build locally - I think you could even do some limited testing with github actions to make sure your image is correct before you pull it down locally
[00:18:45] <tabakhase> (so some `docker run -v myappmodulecache:/usr/local/lib/python??/dist-packages -v $PWD:/app my/baseimage sh` and work from there)
[00:18:56] <ada_> I might also explore doing deploys to a remote VPS instead of locally if you're on a metered connection
[00:19:12] <ada_> EC2 free tier or GCP's $300 intro 
[00:20:32] <foo> ada_ / tabakhase - super appreciate this, thank you.
[00:21:47] <foo> meh, it looks like simply adding 1 line still caused the build to reinstall all requirements. I wonder, is there a way to see how much bandwidth docker is using during a build?
[00:21:50] * foo investigates
[00:22:06] <foo> It's possible it's not as much as I think and not an issue
[00:22:29] <foo> docker stats looks to be only for running containers
[00:24:10] * foo tries to set a docker-compose command to "bash" so he can get in and do something on a specific container
[00:24:17] <tabakhase> bandwith used isnt tracked anywhere yea... closest you could hack together are likely some iptable-counter rules you whack in the docker chians
[00:24:22] <tabakhase> "bash" ends instantly
[00:24:29] <foo> tabakhase: so I learned. :) Trying a sleep 2h 
[00:24:40] <tabakhase> thats one way yes ;D

[01:07:44] *** Joins: shokohsc (~shokohsc@161.88.195.77.rev.sfr.net)
[01:07:55] <programmerq> kind of. VOLUME is the image author's way of specifying where that container is intended to store data that shouldn't go into the copy-on-write filesystem at runtime. You'll still want to specify a -v at runtime for persistent data so you can control where it actually lands-- a named volume or bind mount, for example.
[01:08:44] <programmerq> if there's a VOLUME directive and no -v at runtime, it'll populate an anonymous volume which is perfectly fine for caches or other usecases.

[02:01:47] <tabakhase> as said, there should be literally "nothing" stopping you from "docker run docker:dind" and running with that....
[02:02:11] <gooble_gobble> yum and systemd are stopping me :/
[02:02:17] <tabakhase> "your build" wouldnt run in this anyhow - and kernel still comes from the parent/hosts, so none of that container kinda matters
[02:02:51] <tabakhase> on this, remember that "your docker cli" and "docker-daemon" have nothing todo with another in some sense
[02:03:40] <tabakhase> so "your build" may use docker:git - or even smth entirely else, with just the "docker-cli" binary pulled in and pointing it to the dind instance
[02:05:56] <devslash> after I build an image, i push it to github as username/myapp with 2 tags. 1 for the version and 1 for latest. after pushing the builds if i do docker pull username/myapp:latest its not pulling the latest image

[02:09:01] <devslash> sorry
[02:09:07] <devslash> i meant docker hub
[02:09:12] <devslash> too manu hub sites....
[02:09:15] <devslash> many
[02:09:34] <tabakhase> and define "push with two tags" - push can only push one, and "tags are independend from another" kinda
[02:09:45] <tabakhase> so if you tag as two things, you need two docker push XY´s
[02:09:51] <devslash> no you can push more than 1 tag
[02:10:00] <devslash> i push my image to docker with the tag 1.6
[02:10:06] <devslash> which is the latest version
[02:10:09] <devslash> number
[02:10:27] <devslash> and then again with the latest tag so latest always points to the newest build
[02:11:11] <tabakhase> "latest" is just a string, no magic function on this at all - so "docker push my/name:1.6 && docker push my/name:latest" to actually push both
[02:11:26] <tabakhase> pretty sure that "docker push my/name:1.6 my/name:latest" is not a thing
[02:11:27] <devslash> ok
[02:11:37] <devslash> so youre saying that you cannot pull with the latest tag ? 
[02:11:57] <gooble_gobble> tabakhase, i worked through my issue. And besides the help, youve given me some best practices / reading to look into. Thank you very much!
[02:12:11] <tabakhase> gooble_gobble youre welcome =)
[02:13:07] <devslash> is it possible to pull an image from docker hub and force it to redownload the image
[02:14:06] <devslash> otherwise i have to delete my 2 contains that use the image, delete the image and then pull the image again which is a pain in the ass
[02:14:40] <tabakhase> devslash docker pull does just that - the only "more force" to put on that is if you delete your local tag, then run garbage collect to get rid of layers, then repull ((what you shouldnt need like "ever" unless you messed around deep in /var/lib/docker by hand and corrupted smth :P
[02:14:51] <devslash> no
[02:14:56] <devslash> pull doesnt pull the latest
[02:15:08] <devslash> docker pull myname/myapps:latest
[02:15:26] <tabakhase> it will pull exactly what you pushed as "myname/myapps:latest" 
[02:15:49] <devslash> when i do docker image ls it shows that the image was updated 2 weeks ago
[02:15:50] <devslash> which is wrong
[02:15:59] <tabakhase> "docker build -t my/image:1.6 -t my/image:latest && docker push my/image:1.6" will NOT update "latest"
[02:16:02] <devslash> thats the previous not the latest verison
[02:16:16] <devslash> i did docker push myname/myapp:latyest
[02:16:28] <devslash> that does update the latest and I can see that omn the docker hub site
[02:16:46] <devslash> the hash for t he latest tag matches the tag for the latest version number which is 1.6

[14:08:02] <faceface> The issue I'm having (the reason I turned to defreitas/dns-proxy-server) is that one of my docker services is running a webserver frontend, and that frontend contains JS that reaches out to a named backend (service) to fetch a resource. When I only publish the ports of the frontend, I can see the webpage fine (obvs), but when it tries to fetch the backend resource it cant (the URL is broken).

[14:13:00] <tabakhase> and if youre supposed to reach the backend "directly" - you should just publish that too - and the "name where to search for this" should be a config item
[14:13:29] <faceface> yes, each of the 3 services is configured how to 'see' each other
[14:13:51] <faceface> I'm migrating from a version where we literally had 3 boxes with 3 domain names to a dockerized version
[14:15:18] <faceface> I had the feeling that IP addresses in this context would be more fragile, e.g. how do I know the IP address of a given named network up front to add that to the config. I guess I can do that using docker-compose to set the IPs

[14:33:15] <Lyn> what happens if, on a server, you start a docker container, which listens to port 22, and then try to ssh to that same server?
[14:33:42] <faceface> Lyn: if you publish 22 to 22, it should fail to start
[14:33:44] <tabakhase> faceface well the 127.0.0.1 is "your host", and all fragilnes behind docker takes care to plumb in --- and if your config/tooling allows ports, even better indeed
[14:34:37] <faceface> Lyn: assuming 22 is already running ssh on the host
[14:35:31] <faceface> tabakhase: config allows ports yes... what do you mean by 'plumb in'?
[14:35:34] <tabakhase> (there just is a lot of stuff that doesnt take ports, and then people loose there minds when they cant use ".80" or ".443" for two things as if they never used "http://xyz:8080" in the browser :D
[14:35:48] <faceface> use a user-defined bridge network?
[14:36:12] <Lyn> how should that situation be remedied? Gitlab container uses port 22 i.e. ssh for git things, but I'd also like to be able to ssh access the server itself remotely
[14:36:25] <tabakhase> plumbing as in published-ports
[14:36:37] <tabakhase> Lyn gitlab has a extra note on that how to make it work
[14:36:42] <faceface> Lyn: you need to map port 22 on the container to some other port on the host
[14:37:17] <faceface> tabakhase: thanks
[14:37:44] <Lyn> oh I see, I'll try to find it
[14:40:31] <tabakhase> i cant find the dam doc right now... but there is a way that basically "uses the host as jump-host to ssh into the actual container"...
[14:41:23] <tabakhase> but using an alternative port (and what setting to change to have the copy-pasteable clone url reflect that port) is in the docker-gitlab install notes
[14:41:28] <Lyn> https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/docker.html ctrl f _ssh_
[14:44:40] <faceface> "uses the host as jump-host to ssh into the actual container" <- That's usually something like "ssh host -L 2222:container:22"
[14:45:01] <faceface> then you ssh localhost:2222 and magically end up on the container
[14:45:42] <faceface> and you can hide all that in .ssh/config

[17:02:09] <programmerq> blusky▸ I somewhat recently wrote up an SO answer for this topic. let me see if I can find it.
[17:02:33] <blusky> <3
[17:02:34] <programmerq> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68284582/how-to-find-availability-of-newer-versions-of-docker-images-in-docker-compose/68488168#68488168 <-- blusky
[17:02:46] <programmerq> tldr; not really an existing tool, but you could write one.
[17:03:56] <programmerq> I did show how to use 'reg' to list tags. If you're using semver, there are semver parsers/comparison tools. You could then feed the specific version into your compose file with an env var
[17:04:04] <blusky> ok, I understand :-) I already started writing one
[17:04:15] <blusky> but I was wondering if I was reinventing the wheel
[17:05:04] <blusky> didn't know reg, it would have saved me a lot of time ^^
[17:05:13] <blusky> (was using requests in python)
[17:05:55] <blusky> It's kind of sad that there aren't any standard for tags / version in docker image
[17:05:58] <programmerq> all the various bits exist, but you just need to glue them together. Since image tag names are up to the image publisher there's no really good generic solution that would work across the board. There is a tool called watchtower that some folks like. It will try to see if there's a newer version of the same tag and recreate your container with the same options.
[17:06:38] <blusky> Watchtower is very dangerous as it will pull the image to know if an update is needed
[17:06:45] <programmerq> I'm a fan of pushing a newly built image as both :x.y.z and :production or :staging -- depending on whether I'm promoting x.y.z to one of those environments.
[17:06:53] <programmerq> yeah, I'm def not a fan of watchtower.
[17:07:03] <blusky> so watchtower will force an update on docker-compose down / up
[17:07:04] <programmerq> just tossing it out there in case you hadn't come across it.
[17:07:09] <blusky> thanks :-)
[17:07:21] <programmerq> it's fine for some things I've done
[17:08:18] <blusky> We switched from "latest" tag to version fixed tag, because of potencial migration problem on major version updating for some project
[17:08:38] <blusky> I think watchtower will only seek of update on the same tag
[17:08:50] <blusky> (and we don't want to go back to latest everywhere)

[17:16:29] <tabakhase> thats more an issue of "latest"(&similars) than watchtower id say tho... - using it for "named tags" is always a little meh sure - but even a "nginx:1.12.1" may be watchtower-ed so you get generic baseimage updates and such

[22:04:59] <catbehemoth> hi I am trying to figure out docker behind firewalld. Docker created a docker zone as per docs and added docker0 and br-blahblah interfaces (br-blahblah are custom networks I set up) to it. but what about the interfaces for individual containers (all the interfaces beginning with vethXXXXXXXXX) should they be in docker zone as well or public?
