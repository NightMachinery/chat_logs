[07:14:13] <maroon> mention of bash gave me the impression it was for some OS i cant run, so i didnt look too closely at at

[07:15:04] <halo> (it's written in Haskell, so reasonably portable)

[14:27:10] <yawkat> if the function performs the fiat-shamir transform on a proof of knowledge (i.e. fiat_shamir is a higher order function) then the name makes sense. if it's just a signature it does not

[14:31:44] <yawkat> well, what does the function do
[14:32:33] <sshine> it hashes a proof stream up until a point in a protocol.
[14:33:00] <sshine> the proof stream is the interface between two parties. the protocol is non-interactive.
[14:33:01] <yawkat> then it's a sensible name imo

[20:32:21] <ano> what (openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -p ...) does if passphrase longer than 32B? if specify -K longer than 32B then get "hex string is too long, ignoring excess" but not for manually entered passphrase longer than 32B
[20:34:40] <ano> does it calc 32B long hash of passphrase, what algo then?

[20:53:06] <ms7821> if you use -K you're specifying a key, which shouldn't ever need to be longer than 256 bits. If you use -p, it uses a KDF to derive the key, and there should be no practical limit on length
[20:53:23] <ms7821> -pass, sorry

[21:24:32] <[itchyjunk]> Not really sure. I guess I could do with some learning about crypto. Start with a hello world and work my way up.
[21:24:48] <[itchyjunk]> Q computing is interesting to me but i've not made much progress in that front.
[21:28:36] <hgst> [itchyjunk]: I've found the resources in the gist in /topic to be very helpful
[21:28:51] <hgst> still working my way through some of them, but I already feel much more well-equipped now than I did before-hand
[21:28:56] <[itchyjunk]> Checking it out now
[21:30:48] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[21:31:56] <hgst> also, I'm elated that “The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work” is directly linked in /topic; it should be required reading (frankly, I think it should be required reading for everyone in the software industry, not just crypto, but I'll do my part to spread it as I can and fight the battles I can win)
[21:34:09] <[itchyjunk]> Hmm, books and challenges. I don't know much programming. I should probably stick with the theory part of crypto initially.
[21:34:54] <[itchyjunk]> Is there a specific dictionary to look up words? or do you just use google/oxford ?

[22:20:51] <Alipha> [itchyjunk]: I'm curious then what your goal of learning cryptography if you don't program
[22:21:28] <[itchyjunk]> No particular goals, just wanna learn some and see where it takes me.
[22:21:31] <Alipha> You want to use existing tools, such as pgp and openssl, and be able to configure TLS settings or such, and know what they mean?
[22:21:33] <[itchyjunk]> I program a little.
[22:21:48] <[itchyjunk]> No, i'm more interested in the theory than application for the most part.

[22:36:27] <[itchyjunk]> i'll try to get some terminology down then pick like AES or w/e is the simplest and see how far I can go, i think.
