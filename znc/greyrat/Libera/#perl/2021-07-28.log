[17:39:40] <ehuelsmann[m]> it's high time for the cloud providers to start supporting ipv6.

[17:40:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> whereas ipv6 is nearly free.
[17:40:55] <simcop2387> a single /64 ipv6 should be free, i'd be fine with them charging for larger blocks.
[17:41:36] <ehuelsmann[m]> yea. the single one is free. the larger block costs a bit, but nowhere near 2$ per address.
[17:43:05] <simcop2387> yea a /56 should cost maybe $1-2 (some trivial price) given that i think large providers are giving out of things like a /32 to all their customers

[17:44:38] <simcop2387> that's one thing that comcast and some others have actually started to get decent about, just turning on dual stack for everyone.  cell companies have done that for a long time simply because it makes their job easier.

[17:49:46] <simcop2387> if i had a way to safely give you some ipv6 space i would let you do it.
[17:50:44] <ehuelsmann[m]> there was the option to run an ipv6 tunnel to HE. However, I found that wasn't as reliable as I'd like it to be.
[17:50:46] <ehuelsmann[m]> traffic was routed through the states, I guess.
[17:50:53] * ilmari has IPv6 at home (hyperoptic) and on both VMs (bytemark, hetzner)
[17:50:54] <ehuelsmann[m]> long ping times to my regular sites...
[17:51:04] <ilmari> a /64 each
[17:51:45] <simcop2387> yea the HE tunnel stuff works as a way to test but it was never stable enough for general use in my experience.
[17:51:50] <ilmari> my matrix homeserver is seeing about 35% IPv6 for incoming federation requests
[17:52:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> ilmari: I've considered setting up a VPN from my laptop to a Hetzner instance running IPv6 over an IPv4 encapsulated tunnel.
[17:52:24] <simcop2387> ilmari: i used to get a /56 from my isp in california.  hoping i can do that again once i've got my own place and isp again.  being able to give each vlan their own /64 was nice.
[17:52:27] <ehuelsmann[m]> my webservers even see measurable ipv6 traffic.
[17:53:36] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: if you want to do a wireguard vpn over cell networks, ipv6 is a must have.  otherwise the CGNAT that they use tends to get completely in the way because it'll disconnect long lived connections a lot.  currently their ipv6 stuff doesn't suffer from that.
[17:54:22] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'll have to bug my isp again.

[20:05:16] <ehuelsmann[m]> oh. not my doing, btw.
[20:05:25] <thrig> of course.
[20:05:37] <genio> suuuuure. we believe you
[20:05:51] <LeoNerd> genio: OK. So, justabout ready to call it 2.000. I'm basically adding a "TODO" docs section to list the remainign things we havne't done
[20:06:01] <LeoNerd> I'm just wondering what else to do overall
[20:06:11] <LeoNerd> More docs adjusting? metadata stuff... 
[20:08:40] <shlomif> thrig: ehuelsmann[m] : sup?
[20:09:18] <genio> Docs could definitely be made better with better examples in the synopsis. metadata stuff to be sure. either merge or rename the branch to master/main. setup CI on Windows on the repo. (I started that last one but held off when I was running into the problems of libuv and older mingw)
[20:09:44] <LeoNerd> I've already merged it to `master` not
[20:09:45] <LeoNerd> *now
[20:09:51] <LeoNerd> There's CI in there too
[20:10:56] <genio> ah, so there is. all good then
[20:11:23] <genio> LeoNerd++
[20:11:33] <thrig> ci? why is rcs being used
[20:11:59] <LeoNerd> CI = Continuous Integration
[20:12:28] <LeoNerd> Which, with my mathematicians' hat on, is a strange phrase. Integration is by its very nature, continuous. Discrete "integration" is called "summation"
[20:13:16] <Grinnz> an integral distinction
[20:13:25] <thrig> I'd call it "punctuated testing" as I'd agree nothing I've heard about it suggests continuous
[20:13:36] <genio> UV::Loop has no documentation link on the loop function docs in the base UV doc
[20:13:46] <LeoNerd> Perhaps I'm just being too analytical about it?
[20:14:11] <thrig> but naming things poorly (e.g. "move" in assembly) is what computer types do...
[20:14:13] <LeoNerd> genio: Yah, examples would be nice. As ever I'm basically terrible at being able to think of any
[20:14:24] <genio> Let's just assume it's Commit Integration testing
[20:14:25] <LeoNerd> thrig: Ohgod, I really wish that had been called "CP", for "copy"
[20:14:32] <LeoNerd> It doesn't *move* data, it copies it. Nondestructively
[20:15:08] <LeoNerd> Actually some architectures call it "T" for transfer. E.g. TAX, transfer the A register into X.
[20:15:34] <thrig> but that goes over well with libertarians
