[03:10:34] <signalblue> oh will it?
[03:10:42] <Hunterkll> if you have a proper separate address pool with RRAS provided NAT, etc
[03:10:50] <signalblue> I have it port forwarded and all
[03:11:04] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> Hunterkll, I'm trying to push 300+MB/s over 10gig, samba with smb v3 enabled, 8x z2
[03:11:16] <signalblue> vpn.<$corpDomain> is forwarded internally to that server
[03:11:25] <Hunterkll> windows could do that easily :P
[03:11:26] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:11:34] <signalblue> 300Mbps is nothing
[03:11:41] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> Bytes
[03:11:42] <signalblue> for any OS
[03:11:50] <Hunterkll> signalblue: MB not Mb 
[03:11:52] <signalblue> yeah 300 megabytes
[03:12:00] <signofzeta> 300 MBps = 2.4 Gbps
[03:12:11] <signalblue> yes
[03:12:12] <signofzeta> "When this baby hits 10 Gbps, you're gonna see some shit."
[03:12:13] <Hunterkll> signalblue: if he's got dedupe on or using ARC or something silly - with ZFS - ram and CPU come into play here
[03:12:17] <Hunterkll> as well as nic offloading, etc 
[03:12:26] <signalblue> nic offloading to CPU?
[03:12:35] <Hunterkll> .....
[03:12:36] <Hunterkll> no.....
[03:12:40] <Hunterkll> where the hell did you get that 
[03:12:42] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> No CPU seems low
[03:12:54] <signalblue> pulled it out of my hat
[03:12:55] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> No dedupe
[03:13:02] <Hunterkll> like wtf is "nic offloading to cpu" even supposed to be
[03:13:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:13:07] <Hunterkll> signalblue: http://support.prolinksystems.com/support/discussions/topics/11000017077
[03:13:09] <layer8> Title:  L2TP VPN Using Microsoft RRAS : Client Portal 
[03:13:11] <Hunterkll> take a gander at that 
[03:13:27] <Hunterkll> section 2 doesn't apply to you 
[03:13:35] <Hunterkll> since obvoiusly, clients can connect
[03:13:41] <Hunterkll> signalblue: can clients access the internal network at least?
[03:13:50] <signalblue> yes they can
[03:14:00] <Hunterkll> okay, damn, yea now its bringing back memories
[03:14:06] <signalblue> the clients call me everyday saying they can but they want internet too
[03:14:37] <signalblue> CPU offloads to NIC
[03:15:14] <Hunterkll> kind of..... anyway
[03:15:24] <Hunterkll> i said 'as well as nic offloading, etc' as in that it was an entirely separate part of the thi ng
[03:15:28] <Hunterkll> a different factor
[03:15:31] <Hunterkll> not related to the other factors
[03:15:33] <signalblue> yeah I get that
[03:15:35] <Hunterkll> there was no reason in what i said to connect the two
[03:15:36] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:15:39] <Hunterkll> anyway
[03:15:45] <Hunterkll> well, i know how to fix this on NT4 workstation 
[03:15:46] <Hunterkll> xD
[03:15:48] <signalblue> GRE is not opened
[03:15:55] <signalblue> that may be an issue?
[03:15:58] <Hunterkll> nah
[03:16:02] <Hunterkll> if you can access internal network, you're good there
[03:16:16] <Hunterkll> it's a routing kerfluffle 
[03:16:22] <signalblue> right but it's forwarded from the Internet
[03:16:22] *** Quits: gromdom (~Username@109.201.152.164) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[03:16:30] <signalblue> from the router/firewall if you will
[03:16:34] <Hunterkll> oh
[03:16:37] <Hunterkll> GRE is a different protocol 
[03:16:43] <signalblue> Yes it is
[03:16:45] <Hunterkll> trying telnet/tcp connection tests won't show it open
[03:16:51] <signalblue> I'm well aware of that
[03:16:52] <Hunterkll> so you need to use a different tool to check it
[03:16:54] <Hunterkll> okay
[03:16:55] <signalblue> it's ID 47
[03:17:39] <Hunterkll> so what i'm thinking here, from ancient memories
[03:17:45] <signalblue> go in
[03:17:50] <signalblue> go on*
[03:18:01] <Hunterkll> is that it's using the RRAS server as its gateway - and onyl that - and the RRAS server is handling traffic but not routing it out any further 
[03:18:10] <signalblue> that's correct
[03:18:11] <Hunterkll> i'm trying to remember how to add the last hop 
[03:18:25] <Hunterkll> last time I set this up was in like, 2015 or 2016 lol
[03:18:25] <signalblue> but if I enable do not use gateway on RRAS server from the client
[03:18:32] <signalblue> it's a split tunnel of sorts
[03:18:45] <Hunterkll> right.... that's exactly what it is 
[03:18:57] <signalblue> that's not what we're looking for here
[03:19:06] <Hunterkll> regulatory concern?
[03:19:11] <signalblue> we want to route all traffic through RRAS to the Internet
[03:19:22] <signalblue> that plus some other factors
[03:19:49] <Hunterkll> i'm thinking the easy way is to light up NAT on the RRAS server for the clients 
[03:19:55] <Hunterkll> which is ugly, but easy bandaid
[03:20:06] <Hunterkll> since it sounds like you won't be able to set up proper vlan/pools/etc
[03:20:17] <signalblue> ugly is fine
[03:20:26] <signalblue> step 6 of this? https://www.snel.com/support/how-to-set-up-a-l2tp-ipsec-vpn-on-windows-server-2016/
[03:20:49] <Hunterkll> yup
[03:20:58] <signalblue> lol was that your bandaid?
[03:20:59] <signalblue> nice
[03:21:26] <Hunterkll> i actually had a proper vlan clients were dumped into using the true network gateway etc 
[03:21:52] <signalblue> different from the RRAS gateway I assume
[03:22:17] <signalblue> there's only one gateway here
[03:22:20] <signalblue> one public IP
[03:23:06] <signalblue> but I believe I did step 6 a while back to no avail
[03:23:07] <Hunterkll> yea when you first did the wizard you pr obably selected remote access
[03:23:10] <Hunterkll> instead of VPN & NAT 
[03:23:10] <signalblue> will try again
[03:23:20] <signalblue> that's not correct
[03:23:26] <Hunterkll> hm?
[03:23:27] <signalblue> because if you do that then...
[03:23:39] <signalblue> the NAT panel will not even show ip
[03:23:41] <signalblue> up*
[03:23:59] <Hunterkll> oh the RRAS configuration UI should still show it but either way
[03:24:05] <signalblue> ah ok
[03:24:13] <signalblue> rrasmgmt.msc
[03:25:47] <signalblue> you had to add the IP Policy from MMC?

[08:48:29] <yuken> Hunterkll, https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003067072749.html? this... has to be illegal just, in general, no?
[08:48:33] <yuken> Those look like complete baffles.
[08:48:50] <yuken> as in, the "inner hole" is them drilling out the entire thing.
[08:49:20] <Hunterkll> dunno
[08:49:31] <Hunterkll> i'm not familiar with the specifics with how the 'kit' ones work legally
[08:49:36] <Hunterkll> but it probably is in most scenarios
[08:49:58] <Hunterkll> yuken: it looks like one cap may not be drilled out?
[08:50:00] <yuken> if it can shoot a round non-catastrophically and is even somewhat designed to mitigate sound, it's a silencer/silencer part - so if that's drilled out...
[08:50:23] <Hunterkll> oh oh
[08:50:27] <Hunterkll> yuken: look at the review pictures
[08:50:32] <Hunterkll> the hole is a cross cut, not actually drilled
[08:50:39] <yuken> ah. that might be enough.
[08:50:47] <Hunterkll> and a closed end cap
[08:50:55] <Hunterkll> if you fire that as-is, boom goes your barrel
[08:50:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:51:06] <yuken> hm. I'm trying to pick out a kit to form 1 r/n, and that actually looks pretty solid.
[08:51:12] <yuken> $500 total, full titanium.
[08:51:24] <Hunterkll> huh no
[08:51:28] <Hunterkll> looking at the other view
[08:51:31] <Hunterkll> looks like the hole is out 
[08:51:48] <Hunterkll> https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/U659824577b134166ae6c3c349bcc5cb9U.jpg
[08:51:50] <yuken> Yeah, it definitely looks sketchy.
[08:51:50] <Hunterkll> was just the angle
[08:52:03] <yuken> But if I had a Form 1 already accepted...
[08:52:30] <Hunterkll> import laws/regulation
[08:53:00] <Hunterkll> but one end cap is closed
[08:53:02] <Hunterkll> so *shrug*
[08:53:11] <Hunterkll> you'd have to drill that out yourself if it's the "wrong" end cap 
[08:53:20] <yuken> Hmmmm.
[08:53:35] <Hunterkll> can't tell which one it is though
[08:53:37] <yuken> Well I sure as fuck hope it's legal.
[08:53:53] <yuken> I was also considering making the _crappiest_ silencer possible, but with a good tube, and having it recored by a manufacturer.

[10:07:03] <Hunterkll> yea i just hook up an HDD or two 
[10:07:12] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I have two 10A load cells
[10:07:14] <Hunterkll> i think on like ~10 years or so past of psus its probably not an issue anymore
[10:07:27] <CableNinja> its saying that multiple functions /consts are already defined.. I couldnt provide an example, too much code
[10:07:30] <Hunterkll> but it was about ensuring some load on both 10 and 5 rails 
[10:07:31] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> 2017 seasonic
[10:07:51] <CableNinja> multiple definition of `config_mount'	E:\Projects\...\data_control\data_config.c	188
[10:07:52] <Hunterkll> should be fine but out of historical caution i'd still tag a 3.5" drive on it to provide load stabilizing on both major rails 
[10:08:05] <Hunterkll> so.....
[10:08:08] <Hunterkll> search for config_mount and see?
[10:08:15] <Hunterkll> could be macro defined, function prototype, etc 
[10:08:16] <CableNinja> config_mount is a const char defined in a header
[10:08:37] <Hunterkll> well, it's telling you it's being defined twice, so comb every referenced file ..... 
[10:08:38] <CableNinja> I was doing some work in a ton of files
[10:08:54] <CableNinja> its in a header file
[10:09:04] <CableNinja> but its behind an #ifndef
[10:09:17] <Hunterkll> https://github.com/stefankueng/grepWin
[10:09:30] <Hunterkll> slap that against the directories of relevance to find references quickly
[10:09:33] <CableNinja> so like, the only thing I can think of is I fucked up some syntax somewhere but the ide is too far fucked to unfuck itself and figure it out

[10:11:13] <CableNinja>  Hunterkll a fucking function definition O.o
[10:11:16] <CableNinja> status_code_t save_config_flags(void) {
[10:11:35] <Hunterkll> is it defining anything inside of it 
[10:11:47] <Hunterkll> and is that a prototype or the actual function 
[10:12:06] <CableNinja> actual function
[10:12:19] <CableNinja> I use config_mount there, but its not defined there
[10:13:10] <Hunterkll> yea, i'd have to see - not enough info for me
[10:13:21] <Hunterkll> best i can say is grep your files for it and see what all references are there
[10:13:31] <Hunterkll> the usage might be indicating you have double defintions elsewhere somehow
[10:14:03] <CableNinja> I've double and triple checked thats not the case. I also get like 20 other 'multiple definitions of {thing}' for different things, all of which are pretty unrelated
[10:14:22] <Hunterkll> might have something included in a different file in a different way 
[10:14:23] <Hunterkll> like
[10:14:30] <fritzwastaken> s/ble/bubble
[10:14:32] <layer8> CableNinja meant: "I've doububble and triple checked thats not the case. I also get like 20 other 'multiple definitions of {thing}' for different things, all of which are pretty unrelated"
[10:14:33] <Hunterkll> a header included in another header, which is causing evereything being fucky

[10:15:44] <Hunterkll> wait
[10:16:13] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: is this header defining a variable (global, for sake of discussion), used in multiple .c files, all compiling into the same end result?

[10:17:37] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, yeah, 
[10:17:37] <CableNinja> #include <config_db.h>, which has: https://paste.debian.net/1210344/
[10:17:59] <Hunterkll> yeaaa
[10:18:00] <Hunterkll> that's why
[10:18:07] <CableNinja> the #ifndef should prevent that though
[10:18:36] <CableNinja> if not defined CONFIG_DB_H (define these things)
[10:19:17] * Hunterkll thinks
[10:19:24] <Hunterkll> C++ this is easy to solve with namespaces 
[10:19:44] <Hunterkll> but that ~should~ work
[10:19:50] <CableNinja> right.../
[10:19:59] <Hunterkll> if you're only doing config_db_h_  in one file only
[10:20:03] <Hunterkll> one .c only 
[10:20:04] <CableNinja> the only thing I can think of is I really fucked some syntax somewhere but I cant find anywhere else
[10:20:18] <CableNinja> no, I am not unfortunately
[10:20:26] <Hunterkll> then that's the pr oblem
[10:20:39] <CableNinja> .... but it was working before without complaint.. ?
[10:20:54] <Hunterkll> not sure there
[10:21:03] <Hunterkll> but if say, data_config.c and data_network.c both define config_db_h_ 
[10:21:07] <Hunterkll> then that's multiple definitions 
[10:21:19] <Hunterkll> ifndef doesn't protect you there
[10:21:32] <CableNinja> wut
[10:21:36] <CableNinja> how would it not?
[10:21:45] <Hunterkll> because you are defining them in both c files
[10:21:52] <CableNinja> #ifndef is pre-procssor speak for 'if we havent already done this thing'
[10:22:10] <Hunterkll> yes....
[10:22:12] *** Joins: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi)
[10:22:17] <Hunterkll> but you're declaring the same const in two different c files 
[10:22:18] <Hunterkll> right?
[10:22:22] <CableNinja> no?
[10:22:26] <Hunterkll> but you just did 
[10:22:31] <Hunterkll> say that
[10:22:32] <CableNinja> #include'ing them
[10:22:38] <Hunterkll> ah
[10:23:23] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, this is data_network.c https://paste.debian.net/1210346/
[10:23:24] <Hunterkll> but both say, data_config.c and data_network.c use the same variables, right?
[10:23:57] <CableNinja> and data_config.c https://paste.debian.net/1210347/
[10:24:02] <Hunterkll> yea
[10:24:19] <Hunterkll> so if they're both defining the same variable but eventually being compiled into one big one
[10:24:21] <Hunterkll> that won't work
[10:24:40] <Hunterkll> best you can do is declarations in the header file, then actually assign value in the C file 
[10:24:47] <catbeard> welcome to #c
[10:25:03] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, sorry that last bit didnt make sense
[10:25:16] <Hunterkll> you are literally defining the same const in two different C files being compiled together 
[10:25:17] <CableNinja> if I try to do that I get 'readonly' complaints
[10:25:24] <Hunterkll> hm?
[10:25:29] <CableNinja> but the #ifndef should stop that
[10:25:38] <Hunterkll> oh
[10:26:03] <Hunterkll> extern const char* config_mount; 
[10:26:06] <Hunterkll> in the header file
[10:26:10] <catbeard> lulz
[10:26:17] <catbeard> trying to modify a const
[10:26:24] <CableNinja> lol
[10:26:41] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, but then I'd have to do like 'config_mount = "root"` in the C file right?
[10:26:45] <Hunterkll> yes
[10:26:53] <CableNinja> hm
[10:26:57] <Hunterkll> you'd have to do const char *config_mount = "root";
[10:27:05] <misspwn> wow i don't know how to do all that but you made it easy to read and understand
[10:27:17] <Hunterkll> in the C file
[10:27:47] <CableNinja> but I'm confused why did this compile fine until yesterday?
[10:27:57] <Hunterkll> well, what'd you change?
[10:28:08] <CableNinja> fuckin everything lol
[10:28:13] <Hunterkll> well then
[10:28:17] <Hunterkll> wait
[10:28:27] <CableNinja> tfw you ignore 'commit often' in your own projects
[10:28:30] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: well,  i see 8/29 is when you first made the header, so within the past few days or yesterday 
[10:28:34] <Hunterkll> you probably moved those variables out of the C file
[10:28:37] <Hunterkll> and wanted to rely on the header
[10:28:38] <Hunterkll> which
[10:28:39] <Hunterkll> surprise
[10:28:40] <Hunterkll> you can't
[10:28:57] <gibby> \o misspwn 
[10:28:59] <Hunterkll> in C++ you could define a namespace in the header and just refer to them by that but .... lol 
[10:29:07] <misspwn> HI GIBBY
[10:29:17] <Hunterkll> given this seems to be some kind of embedded system given things like pin_Definition etc 
[10:29:21] <gibby> HI HOW ARE YOU
[10:29:24] <Hunterkll> i suspect you're limited
[10:29:34] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, hm.. yeah... I basically ended up yanking a huge bunch of code out and redoing it, after I made my own very basic filesystem for this shit
[10:29:51] <Hunterkll> yea, i mean honestly
[10:29:51] <catbeard> what you doing barebones os?
[10:30:03] <Hunterkll> right now, ditch the headers and leave the variables in the C file, since you're gonna have to define them anyway.....
[10:30:05] <CableNinja> its for my usb switch stuff catbeard 
[10:30:21] <catbeard> oof alright
[10:30:41] <catbeard> udev tho
[10:30:42] <CableNinja> the config / data storage stuff is all stored on nand flash, and I wanted a decent way of being able to refer to them, so I made my own very basic filesystem
[10:31:06] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: remember, these things .... are - when globally defined, "file global"
[10:31:17] <Hunterkll> so when you collide two files in the linker with the same variable defintions 
[10:31:27] <Hunterkll> it stops, because it doesn't know which one to chose/use 
[10:31:31] <Hunterkll> even if they're the same
[10:31:34] <catbeard> hi misspwn 
[10:31:36] <CableNinja> but I thought thats what the header was for, was to designate those kind of things?
[10:31:52] <Hunterkll> the linker doesn't give a flying *fuck* what was in the header - the header is just copied/pasted into the C file before the compiling stage
[10:31:57] <Hunterkll> that's all it is
[10:32:12] <Hunterkll> so you've got multiple C files with the same shit 
[10:32:14] <catbeard> and all yer functions become numbers
[10:32:30] <CableNinja> catbeard, what the fuck is this, webpack?
[10:32:35] <catbeard> and the linker smokes some grammar trees and rolls your code
[10:32:38] <Hunterkll> that's actually true 
[10:32:48] <Hunterkll> look at the assembler output at an intermediate stage
[10:32:54] <CableNinja> yeah, I've seen the assembler output of things
[10:32:58] <Hunterkll> it's all just numbers and bullshit unless you're intentionally building in debug symbols and shit
[10:33:14] <CableNinja> I found this the other day, thought it was pretty cool https://gcc.godbolt.org/
[10:33:35] <catbeard> if you're into Rust you should check out Zig
[10:33:42] <CableNinja> I dont rust
[10:33:48] * CableNinja is made of stainless steel
[10:33:55] <misspwn> HI CATBEARD sorry i am not trying to interrupt their thought flow because didn't scare me 
[10:34:00] <catbeard> well if you like C you'd enjoy Rust
[10:34:07] <CableNinja> I dont 'like' C
[10:34:16] <CableNinja> I'm using it because it was basically the only option
[10:34:40] <misspwn> my favorite part was what you changed
[10:34:40] <catbeard> it's okay us irc veterans can hold several conversations simultaneously
[10:34:50] <Hunterkll> misspwn: i changed everything and it broke! :D
[10:34:53] <CableNinja> misspwn, lol
[10:34:54] <misspwn> "why did everything break, after changing a bunch of stuff??"
[10:34:55] <yuken> misspwn, https://i.imgur.com/deJKFED.jpg
[10:34:59] <CableNinja> heh
[10:35:00] <catbeard> sometimes even in the same channel
[10:35:01] <misspwn> it's like
[10:35:08] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: in projects like this, it's worth doing a rebuild after every refactor of a single file 
[10:35:16] <misspwn> Hunterkll, your code called you out, that's what happened
[10:35:21] <Hunterkll> so if you plan to change how you do things in 2908402938234903248 files the same
[10:35:24] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, yeah I tried that, and things were going well until yesterday smh
[10:35:29] <Hunterkll> change it in one, make sure that works, change it in two, make sure that works 
[10:35:33] <Hunterkll> then go hog wild
[10:35:45] <Hunterkll> but yup
[10:35:50] <Hunterkll> the linker told you exactly what was wrong :p
[10:35:55] <misspwn> yuken, the fuck am i lookin at
[10:35:56] <catbeard> so i started using vscode's attach debugger with py3.9 debugpy --wait-for-client
[10:35:59] <catbeard> so much yes
[10:36:06] <yuken> misspwn, oops didn't mean to ping you with that
[10:36:13] <misspwn> LOL
[10:36:17] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: Rule 7 : Every include file must contain a mechanism that prevents multiple inclusions of the file.
[10:36:26] <CableNinja> BUT THATS THE #ifndef!!!
[10:36:27] <Hunterkll> that's from a rather good C standards/coding rule set 
[10:36:36] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: yes, but you're allowing it to be included multiple times
[10:36:37] <Hunterkll> :)
[10:36:40] <misspwn> gona need to wear a lot of thick socks to make those boots comfortable
[10:36:42] <CableNinja> how?!?!
[10:36:52] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: because you're including it in several C files which are used elsewhere 
[10:36:53] <catbeard> thicc soccs
[10:37:01] <CableNinja> BUT #ifndef!?!?
[10:37:02] <Hunterkll> in a higher level C file, i'd assume (hierarchy wise)
[10:37:11] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: but it's already included in multiple lower level C files 
[10:37:14] <misspwn> oh shit CableNinja i have unicorn hair now
[10:37:16] <Hunterkll> the parser already included the code
[10:37:18] <misspwn> er catbeard

[10:37:39] <misspwn> let me get this foot off my browser

[10:40:57] <Hunterkll> basically, when it merges all that shit together
[10:40:58] <Hunterkll> yes
[10:41:03] <Hunterkll> you have multiple inclusions of that variable
[10:41:10] <misspwn> CableNinja, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVW8tRtZEZY
[10:41:40] <CableNinja> lol
[10:41:42] <Hunterkll> this *is* only a concern for defined variables
[10:42:20] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, ah, hm... but wouldnt me doing (in the main.c) "#include constants.h" make them then, unavailable, during compile?
[10:42:34] <CableNinja> (and only including constants.h in main.c)
[10:42:40] <Hunterkll> mmmhmmm
[10:42:45] <Hunterkll> because it's preparing them all for linking before then
[10:42:53] <CableNinja> god I hate C
[10:42:55] <Hunterkll> you'd get errors that the variable doesn't exist 
[10:43:02] <catbeard> don't worry, C hates you too :)
[10:43:08] <CableNinja> I know it does
[10:43:09] <Hunterkll> I fuckin' love C 
[10:43:10] <Hunterkll> but still
[10:43:24] <Hunterkll> best you can do is prototypes like i sai d above of the variable and still define it in the .C 
[10:43:37] <CableNinja> I made a fuck ton of code errors in one file because I automatically assumed that '^' was exponent JUST LIKE IT IS IN EVERY OTHER FUCKING LANGUAGE
[10:43:45] <Hunterkll> dude
[10:43:46] <catbeard> xD
[10:43:50] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: using ^ as an exponent post-dates C 
[10:43:51] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:43:58] <catbeard> dat xor
[10:44:07] <Hunterkll> yea, at the time, that was the common usage
[10:44:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:44:15] <misspwn> basically what i'm reading and digesting is that you could have something that pulls something from another file. that other file may contain data that will also tell you to do other things. do you really have to be like "hey pull the color red from file1 but ignore all this from file1 that could also tell you to pull gibby out of a sink hole?
[10:44:20] <CableNinja> I was like 'why the fuck isnt this turning into 65536 like 256^2 fucking should'
[10:44:36] <Hunterkll> "Always put all definitions in .c files and declarations (including macros) in .h files. That should solve the problem 99% of the time."
[10:45:02] <CableNinja> but doesnt using re-definitions of the same variable name take up that precious ram?
[10:45:03] <misspwn> that's a lot of work to tell something what to do
[10:45:15] <misspwn> computrs are dum
[10:45:20] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: ram usage in this case will be identical 
[10:45:26] <Hunterkll> because either way, you're having the same variable
[10:45:28] <Hunterkll> remember 
[10:45:30] <Hunterkll> they're file-global
[10:45:33] <Hunterkll> there's no true "global"
[10:45:40] <CableNinja> like I'd have to put in both data_network and data_config the same 'const char *config_mount = "root"'
[10:45:44] <Hunterkll> so they're global to the file they're declared in 
[10:45:45] <Hunterkll> yes
[10:45:56] <Hunterkll> what you're trying to do has the same effect (or would, if it was possible)
[10:45:59] <Hunterkll> since it's file-level global

[10:49:46] <CableNinja> true
[10:49:55] <Hunterkll> there are times the error messages are horrifically wrong yet right at the same time 
[10:50:02] <Hunterkll> in this case, that wasn't so, i just didn't have the view to see so 
[10:50:16] <misspwn> most people aren't going to want to dive into that and spend the mental energy asking the right questions
[10:50:16] <CableNinja> blah... I really should open my work laptop and see if that shit actually did what I fuckin told it to
[10:50:26] <Hunterkll> but when you're diving into shit like polymorphic code 
[10:50:31] <Hunterkll> compiler errors can go off the fuckin' rails 
[10:50:39] <misspwn> it was just havin a party is all
[10:50:49] <Hunterkll> it is self-modifying code
[10:50:50] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:50:57] <CableNinja> misspwn, yeah true, thats why I like idling here, lots of knowledgeable peoples willing to help (as long as you arent a dumbass)
[10:51:01] <Hunterkll> (polymorphic code mutates itself during runtime)
[10:51:09] <misspwn> then the dj over here put on a nickleback song wondering why the crowd tried to disperse
[10:51:16] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: now imagine if you didn't have screenshots and weren't you, i'd assume it was a homework question LOL
[10:51:50] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, lol reminds me of a git project I found that removed lines of code that broke the compiler until the compiler succeeded
[10:52:03] <misspwn> dang
[10:52:15] <Hunterkll> of course, most of you probably are familiar with polymorphic code and don't realize it
[10:52:21] <Hunterkll> malware that changes itself to avoid AV engine detection 
[10:52:49] <Hunterkll> in fact, i'm pretty sure polymorphic techniques originated with computer viruses
[10:52:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:53:12] <catbeard> for want of a solution for those pesky admins always taking their roots back
[10:53:23] <CableNinja> ITS MY ROOT AND I NEED IT NOW

[10:54:00] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> peter rooter
[10:54:05] <catbeard> roto rooter
[10:54:08] <Hunterkll> anyway
[10:54:09] <Hunterkll> yay
[10:54:10] <Hunterkll> solution
[10:54:17] <CableNinja> 'solution'
[10:54:25] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: honestly, i'd just use refactoring tools in an IDE to maintain the variables instead of defining them in a header
[10:54:31] <Hunterkll> because at this scale you're doubling work 
[10:54:34] <catbeard> solution: obfuscate with xor loader or msfvenom
[10:54:35] <Hunterkll> especially since they're string constants 
[10:54:45] <Hunterkll> if this were say, a struct 
[10:54:53] <Hunterkll> then hell yea, extern definition in the header then define in the C file 
[10:54:56] <Hunterkll> because that can change over time 
[10:55:03] <Hunterkll> add more parts to the struct, etc
[10:55:34] <catbeard> if you write structs, you're probably a top
[10:55:53] <CableNinja> admittedly I'm a C nub just going on 'what I know' and 'what I google'
[10:56:03] <Hunterkll> ya
[10:56:14] <Hunterkll> this is  one you learn through learning C the "right way" and/or a course and/or coding conventions as you learn
[10:56:21] <CableNinja> I've never quite figured out when to/not to use 'extern'
[10:56:22] <Hunterkll> deep diving right in with other language experience will bite you in the ass
[10:56:29] <catbeard> Hunterkll: savannah.nongnu....
[10:56:36] <catbeard> pgubook
[10:56:47] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-extern-keyword-in-c/
[10:57:01] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, yeah having other programming knowledge has really made me think about the shit I know in other languages
[10:57:13] <catbeard> CableNinja: https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pgubook/
[10:57:15] <Hunterkll> there's an old joke though 
[10:57:21] <Hunterkll> C makes it fucking absurdly easy to shoot yourself in the foot
[10:57:29] <Hunterkll> C++ makes it a lot harder, but when you do, you blow your whole leg off
[10:57:55] <CableNinja> heh
[10:58:31] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: and when i say old joke
[10:58:37] <Hunterkll> that's a Bjarne Stroustrup statement 
[10:58:48] <catbeard> BS
[10:59:07] <Hunterkll> catbeard: i mean, he hi mself claims it as his 
[10:59:08] <Hunterkll> so
[10:59:20] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: Stroustrup is basically the inventor of C++ too
[10:59:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:59:23] <Hunterkll> catbeard: https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html
[10:59:33] <catbeard> no i mean like "b s"
[10:59:37] <catbeard> but yeah
[10:59:38] <Hunterkll> pfff
[10:59:38] <Hunterkll> :P
[11:00:08] <CableNinja> I'd be much happier if I could program in something a bit more 'sane' but its far too late to go back and try again
[11:00:19] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: for embedded stuff, this is 'a bit more sane' 
[11:00:20] <CableNinja> or even at least something a bit more forgiving
[11:00:24] <CableNinja> yeah
[11:00:25] <catbeard> just write it in python
[11:00:37] <Hunterkll> higher level languages you'd be fucking beating yourself up with epic stupid hacks to make something simple work
[11:00:53] <catbeard> i mean for py there's modules for damn near everything
[11:00:57] <Hunterkll> C's the "I don't want to use assembler but need to be that close" language
[11:01:00] <catbeard> just pip and import
[11:01:10] <CableNinja> catbeard, that assumes you have an actual linux system
[11:01:16] <catbeard> you don't even need linux
[11:01:18] <Hunterkll> doesn't assume linux at all
[11:01:32] <CableNinja> well you cant `pip install` on an AVR :P
[11:01:37] <catbeard> python -m pip install module
[11:01:38] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: no, but there's CPython 
[11:01:56] <Hunterkll> ah wait, that still needs linux, nevermind xD
[11:01:59] <catbeard> and there's Jython if you want a JVM
[11:02:01] <CableNinja> I dont enjoy writing python :P
[11:02:15] <catbeard> can get you in heaps of trouble
[11:02:29] <CableNinja> s/heap/gcc/
[11:02:30] <layer8> catbeard meant: "can get you in gccs of trouble"
[11:02:34] <CableNinja> s/gcc/gc/
[11:02:35] <layer8> catbeard meant: "can get you in gcs of trouble"
[11:02:55] <CableNinja> get it... garbage collections of trouble?!?
[11:03:11] <Hunterkll> yeaaaaa
[11:03:49] * catbeard slow reveals Hunterkll's sunglasses
[11:04:05] <Hunterkll> catbeard: don't worry, i got the heap joke at least
[11:04:34] <catbeard> CableNinja: have you tried ocaml?
[11:06:42] <CableNinja> I have not
[11:06:57] <Hunterkll> i'ma just head this trolling off here now
[11:07:06] <Hunterkll> bad catbeard 
[11:07:11] <CableNinja> lol
[11:07:34] <catbeard> :)
[11:07:48] <Hunterkll> when he needs to do easy formal verification 
[11:07:55] <Hunterkll> we can broach that fuckin wasps neste
[11:09:51] <catbeard> hyg CableNinja http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf
[11:10:35] <Hunterkll> quit pushing that on him
[11:10:36] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:10:43] <Hunterkll> that bastard aint' got the patience to learn assembly
[11:10:51] <Hunterkll> especially the insanity that x86_64 modern ISA becomes
[11:11:17] <catbeard> well i mean he lern asm every other language becomes "oh cool"
[11:11:48] <catbeard> it's all compiled into assembly operands anyway
[11:17:11] <Hunterkll> I mean yea, learning assembly early on definitely was a huge help
[11:17:23] <Hunterkll> but i learned on a just borderline unbraindamaged ISA
