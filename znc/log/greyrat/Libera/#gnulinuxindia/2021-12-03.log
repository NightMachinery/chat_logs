[11:03:35] <_devnull[m]> KarunM[m]: another unnecessary thing you don't want
[11:04:17] <pystardust> KarunM[m]: irc is a chat platform that only sends messages without storing them. So you would receive messages only when ur connected, a bouncer  will help u store message when ur not connected and relay to you when you are

[11:07:41] <iamak[m]> Is this a correct udev rule? This doesn't get triggered at battery percentage change (but `udevadm monitor` shows that udev is sending an event). The script runs when I run it manually through terminal.
[11:09:20] <pystardust> iamak[m]: take a look at this, I have done them in a different order, also try to run it through shell as I did with /bin/sh -c
[11:09:24] <pystardust> http://0x0.st/-h_p.rules
[11:10:22] <iamak[m]> Why `su`?
[11:11:57] <pystardust> iamak[m]: I dont' want to run the script as root. su changes the user before running (secuirty reasons)
[11:14:11] <pystardust> _devnull[m]: irc bouncer is not irrelavant. You guys should seriously stop using telegram. I know the FOSS alternaitves don't have what ever you need. But if you guys dont' use them then they won't get support and development, If more people use them they will be more popular and get better clients and development. Im telling you to use irc but aleast switch to matrix. This is to all telegram users.
[11:15:06] <pystardust> _devnull[m]:   but if people do not use it then we are defeated. Telegram gets more users more development. We need to use FOSS and self host, we need to be free. If many people do this then there will be more developers working on it

[11:42:30] <sayon> and then type join command
[11:42:42] <sayon> is that how normally ircs are hosted
[11:42:48] <iamak[m]> Yes
[11:45:17] <pystardust> sayon: irc server can be hosted by anyone,  libera.chat is a server. There are many others
[11:46:25] <sayon> okay
[11:46:55] <pystardust> sayon: if you want an irc bouncer let us know

[11:48:04] <pystardust> you don't need @
[11:48:18] <sayon> ok
[11:48:33] <pystardust> sayon: IRC doesn't store ur messages on server, it gets what needs to sent and sends it immediately
[11:49:11] <pystardust> so if you are not connected through hexchat then you won't be able to recieve messages. Say I send you a message when you disconnect then the message will be lost
[11:50:02] <sayon> OOOOH
[11:50:03] <pystardust> irc does only one thing and does it well, sending messages. So to store get messages all the time you would have to be connected 24/7
[11:50:11] <sayon> that's autistic
[11:50:57] <pystardust> this is where a bouncer comes in. It will act as a middle man and store ur message when you are away, once you join it will relay all of them back to you, so you will not lose any message
[11:51:03] <pystardust> sayon: xd
[11:51:17] <sayon> what about the [m] in front of people's  names im seeing on the right panel
[11:51:42] <Arya[m]1> sayon: that are matrix / tg users
[11:52:25] <pystardust> sayon: there is a bridge between irc and matrix, any message send in either one of them will be sent to the other platform. To distinguish the username spaces that [m] is used
[11:52:57] <pystardust> because irc is plain text it has very nice command line programs like these http://0x0.st/-h_w.png
[11:55:25] <sayon> is that a bash script that uploaded your image of irc to oxo.st
[11:56:21] <pystardust> yes sayon ill share it
