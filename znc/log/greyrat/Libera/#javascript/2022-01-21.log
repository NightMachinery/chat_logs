[02:43:12] <ljharb> gross, types shouldn't ship with packages
[02:43:24] <ljharb> that conflates the semver of the types with the semver of the implementation
[02:43:40] <sheetjs> then you create a mismatch between DT module and actual code module
[02:43:55] <ljharb> i'm pretty sure that npm will recognize automatically when a package has DT types - https://www.npmjs.com/package/lockfile-info doesn't ship with any but does have a DT package
[02:44:12] <sheetjs> same reason you ship docs with the code
[02:44:12] <ljharb> sheetjs: you create a potential mismatch, sure. but that's fine, because TS can't properly type JS anyways
[02:44:41] <ljharb> if you make a mistake with the types that's a breaking change to fix, you shouldn't have to do a major bump just for that
[02:45:01] <sheetjs> ostensibly your test suite also checks types
[02:45:10] <ljharb> not if your code's authored in pure JS

[02:45:19] <ljharb> unless you've littered your codebase with jsdoc
[02:45:45] <ljharb> and even then, you'd install the DT package as a dev dep to handle that.

[03:34:46] <ljharb> altho since get_custodial_key also throws synchronously, you might not be, but that just means you need `async` in front of that function

[05:07:04] <jaawerth> de-facto: it's because you're using a for..in loop, which explicitly iterates over the *object* interface to the array. it's basially going through hash mode.I woould definitely use .forEach or for..of instead
[05:08:25] <de-facto> yeah makes sense, just confused me for a moment
[05:08:57] <de-facto> i need the indices to be numeric, hence i will just cast them
[05:09:31] <avu> or, you know, not use for..in?
[05:10:18] <jaawerth> seriously
[05:10:33] <jaawerth> the for..in loop is basically yestigial at this point

[05:11:30] <de-facto> but i do need the indices not the values
[05:11:40] <jaawerth> use one of the array methods
[05:11:51] <avu> de-facto: just change the 'in' to 'of' in your example and it'll work properly..
[05:12:02] <de-facto> well no because i need the indices
[05:12:03] <jaawerth> no for..of won't work if indices are needed
[05:12:20] <jaawerth> it'll be .map, .reduce, .forEac, or a plain old for
[05:12:24] <avu> sure, then forEach with second parameter
[05:12:32] <jaawerth> there are like 500 ways to get the indices
[05:12:33] <avu> better solution in any case

[07:51:41] <ljharb> sure. but either way, *i am giving you a recommendation*

[07:51:53] <ljharb> that's not my experience
[07:52:01] <ljharb> either way, the `./` can be included or omitted, and the extension can be included or omitted
[07:52:16] <ljharb> and i'm telling you that it's best to be explicit with the `./`, and it's best to follow the CJS pattern of omitting extensions as a best practice.
[07:52:28] <ljharb> that's the recommendation of one of the top 10 module authors on the planet

[08:31:16] <Maxdamantus> programmar: I doubt restarting is going to help more than killing the browser.
[08:31:42] <programmar> so my browser indeed runs my codes in the background ?
[08:32:20] <Maxdamantus> Yes, Firefox at will generally run multiple tabs in the same process, so if you try opening another tab, that tab might try to reuse the stuck process.
[08:33:13] <Maxdamantus> If I'm concerned about a stuck Firefox rendering process, I'll just run `top` then kill it from there (usually it will be using 100% CPU, so it's just a matter of pressing "k" in `top` and confirming)
[08:33:33] <Maxdamantus> I think Firefox has a UI for listing its processes too.
[08:34:12] <programmar> Maxdamantus: yes but what i mean is when i close my stuck tab without opening any other tab, will firefox still runs that nasty codes in the background :/
[08:34:22] <Maxdamantus> Right, it's in "More tools" → "Task manager" (or "about:performance")
[08:34:33] <Maxdamantus> programmar: yes, potentially.

[08:36:25] <Maxdamantus> Preferably when you close a tab it should immediately stop whatever that tab was running, but that doesn't happen synchronously in the UI (that is, when you close a tab, it will synchronously remove the tab from the UI, but it will just trigger the tasks to stop).
[08:39:58] *** Quits: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[08:42:59] <programmar> Maxdamantus: if it will just trigger the tasks to stop, wouldn't it be stopped after the tab is removed from the UI ? how is that resulting in the codes still running in the background :/
[08:43:23] <Maxdamantus> programmar: because whatever it was stuck doing has not finished.
[08:44:26] <Maxdamantus> programmar: if it is stopped synchronously, that would mean you click the close button, then the browser triggers the stop and waits for the tab to actually stop before removing it from the UI.
[08:44:43] <Maxdamantus> so the UI will be frozen or something until that process finally finishes doing whatever it's doing.
[08:45:23] <programmar> hm ok then
[08:45:44] <programmar> is that the only thing that firefox do ? i haven't tried this on Chrome or Opera tho
[08:46:04] <programmar> i am not too excited to try either, i currently have some unfinished files opened, restarting again can lose them all

[23:22:39] <TonyStone> Anyone here willing to assist me in creating a quick and dirty chrome extension that modifies the content of a web page?  I have a page in our service reporting system that forces me to select a date from a drop down list.  I simple want that drop down list to be changed to a text feild so i can type the dates rather than select from the list.  Anyone ever do something like this?

[23:41:15] <cthulchu> does bash support async io?

[23:45:05] <Maxdamantus> cthulchu: bash only does IO in the form of commands, which run synchronously. You can fork subshells though, so synchronous things can run in the background.
