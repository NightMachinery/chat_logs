[06:02:16] <kline> the west has already shown theyre not getting militarily involved in ukraine, and if it really comes to it theyll chop support and let ukraine go under while they decide what the fuck theyre going to do about the situation where russia is able to get demands fulfilled by threatening nukes

[16:36:38] <river> ive still not understood the appeal of it..
[16:36:55] <gerikson> open sores
[16:37:23] <river> but you can host non GPL code on it...
[16:37:29] <river> so is it really open sources
[16:38:47] <gerikson> thus the B- score from the FSF
[16:39:06] <gerikson> surprise! Only Savannah is Truly Free(tm)
[16:39:19] <river> is there genuinely zero MIT/BSD code on Savannah
[16:39:38] <gerikson> don't know, don't really care
[16:39:38] <river> > Savannah is a SourceForge-like repository site run by the GNU project. Debian developer Francesco Poli recently tried to host a project there, but was turned down. The reason: the license used is version 2 (only) of the GPL. As can be seen on the project page, GPLv2 is no longer considered to be an acceptable license.
[16:39:40] <river> wow
[16:39:51] <river> you cant even put GPL2 code on there
[16:40:05] <gerikson> Only Pure GNU
[17:10:40] <edk> the annoying thing is that there's really nothing wrong with GPL3 itself
[17:10:58] <river> whys that annoying?
[17:11:26] <edk> because it's written by the FSF, and it's hard to convince anyone that GPL3 is fine when everything else the FSF does and says, including what they do and say about GPL3, is insane
[17:11:34] <river> haha
[17:24:47] <gwozniak> gerikson: yeah, magit falls down when there are lots of files, mainly because Emacs is slow
[17:24:58] <gwozniak> Well, Elisp, really
[17:34:12] <gerikson> guh, I added a big-ass file to git (too large for GH), then removed it, but git still requires me to try to commit it to GH
[17:34:20] <gerikson> not even sure wtf to google for
[17:35:44] <Brekkjern> gerikson: This is why I use this guide for git: https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules
[17:35:45] <buttsbot> GitHub - k88hudson/git-flight-rules: Flight rules for git
[17:36:13] <Brekkjern> It doesn't assume I know all that much and tells me various ways to unfuck the problem with normal human explanations about them
[17:36:22] <gerikson> Brekkjern: ta!
[17:36:41] <Brekkjern> Not sure if you'll find your answer, but it's the first place I check when I cock something up
[17:38:31] <gwozniak> Seems like a good collection of stuff
[17:39:00] <gwozniak> And it's a testament to Git's design that such a thing needs to exist
[17:39:05] <Brekkjern> Yep :P
[17:39:16] <Brekkjern> Shit's as complicated as a fucking airliner
[17:40:13] <gwozniak> It's pretty horrid
[17:40:47] <gwozniak> I mean, I'm used to it and I only "advocate" for it as a VCS because of all the tooling out there that already works with it
[17:41:08] <gwozniak> But I really would like to use something else (but not Fossil)
[17:41:31] <Brekkjern> Same

[17:47:46] <gerikson> it also uses Visual Basic!

[17:49:19] <gwozniak> Blast from the past
[17:49:56] <gwozniak> The compiler team for the 8-bit parts here uses SVN
[17:53:00] <edk> i feel like git's horribleness is mostly skin-deep
[17:54:18] <gwozniak> I agree.  Git's interface is the main problem.  Its internals are fine.
[17:57:36] <Brekkjern> Yeah, well... If you regularly refer to the structure of your program with terms usually used in the context of sewer systems, then I'm not sure you have actually made a good product...
[17:58:14] <edk> i don't know anything about sewer systems
[17:59:20] <Brekkjern> I don't either, but I usually don't refer to the internals of my programs as the "plumbing" and my user interface as the "porcelain"
[18:01:11] <edk> i've definitely talked about internals of other programs as plumbing
[18:06:23] <Brekkjern> Usually, porcelain refers to either tea cups or the shitter, so...
[18:09:51] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: thanks for the docker/opencontainer links yesterday.  I was able to track down the version I was looking for.
[18:10:07] <skyl4rk> feel like it comes from a long tradition of naming things, slurp, barf
[18:10:08] <gwozniak> Problem is likely a system/interaction thing
[18:10:43] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: Nice to hear! I just googled a bit and found that as a clue, so I didn't really know if it would be helpful at all
[18:11:06] <gerikson> I love plumbing when it works
[18:11:22] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I found some of it when I was looking, but didn't know it was relevant
[18:11:37] <gwozniak> Like, I didn't know opencontainer was actually docker
[18:11:51] <Brekkjern> Well, it is and isn't :P
[18:12:06] <gerikson> git is great and so easy to use, guys https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30554723
[18:12:06] <buttsbot> A GitHub repository was public-viewable | Hacker News
[18:12:31] <Brekkjern> The OCI is a cooperative of different container systems to make sure they all work together
[18:12:58] <gwozniak> Ah, so it must stand for "open container initiative" or something
[18:14:17] <Brekkjern> Yes
[18:14:47] <gwozniak> I had no idea what it meant when I first saw it in the logs
[18:15:02] <river> i am so tired. i dont know why
[18:15:46] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: I had that same experience the first time I had to dig into this rabbithole :P
[18:15:50] <Brekkjern> river: Saaaaame...
[18:16:16] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I appreciate that you were able to make it so that I didn't have to dig so much :)
[18:16:29] <Brekkjern> You're welcome :)
[18:17:04] <gwozniak> I went to the Docker org on Github, saw 70+ repos, none of them being obvious for what I wanted and just sighed
[18:17:26] <gwozniak> And the Github search was... only sort of useful
[18:18:20] <Brekkjern> Just wait until you have to debug something that happens in Kubernetes :P
[18:18:39] <Brekkjern> Then you have several extra layers on top of Docker to deal with, and all of them can be the cause

[18:30:58] <companion_cube> tbh it seemed like it could be a good post‚Ä¶ but maybe it wasn't
[18:31:08] <ngoldbaum> i don‚Äôt really care either way
[18:31:08] <river> it was a tweet
[18:31:13] <river> so it definitely should have been remoevd
[18:31:20] <companion_cube> oh, just a tweet. right.
[18:31:21] <ngoldbaum> but i mean like whose fault is it that pushcx owns the site now‚Ä¶
[18:31:29] <river> im not sure what jcs's problem here is
[18:31:45] <ngoldbaum> he clearly thinks tweets about serenityos are on-topic :p
[18:31:49] <river> lol
[18:32:10] <Brekkjern> Well, jcs isn't wrong, but it's not because he removed that thread :P
[18:32:35] <companion_cube> I hope akling writes a blog post about it, more than just a tweet
[18:32:37] <ngoldbaum> lol true
[18:32:40] <companion_cube> it's still fucking impressive
[18:33:10] <river> it is impresive but...
[18:35:42] <Brekkjern> Yeah, there's just not all that much to talk about unless you are already involved or invested in the project
[18:36:09] <Brekkjern> If you apply the rule of thumb "Reading this post will make me a better programmer", then it doesn't have a place on the site
[18:36:17] <river> i think the biggeswt thing pushcx is doing 'wrong' is doing everything himself
[18:36:32] <Brekkjern> But then again, if you applied that rule consistently to posts on the site, then there wouldn't be many posts left there :P
[18:37:02] <Church> What'd I miss?
[18:37:10] <ngoldbaum> i wonder how much of a clusterfuck the mod applications were if he never did anything with them
[18:37:27] <Brekkjern> lol
[18:37:35] <river> that was such a shitshow
[18:37:44] <Brekkjern> He should just reach out to people he thinks he can trust

[18:39:47] <gerikson> yeah well I'm at a new job so dunno if I can be a good mod
[18:41:27] <ngoldbaum> i guess we have to make hail_spacecake a mod in that case
[18:41:46] <river> make jcs a mod
[18:41:58] <companion_cube> make david_chisnall a mod

[18:44:19] <ngoldbaum> so he can institute oil tuesdays
[18:44:23] <river> haha
[18:44:39] <river> and oil wednesdays and thursdays
[18:45:07] <ngoldbaum> lol he undeleted it
[18:49:43] <gwozniak> I seriously don't care about SerenityOS at all
[18:50:04] <river> im slightly concerned about the guys mental wellbeign

[18:51:55] <companion_cube> seems like it beats being a druct addict
[18:52:55] <river> whoever is writing serenity os
[18:53:33] <gwozniak> I mean, I'm not against it, I just don't care about it, nor do I consider it important
[18:53:37] <companion_cube> I think you're getting it backward, river
[19:03:38] <gwozniak> And for the record, I don't think the SerenityOS tweet is on topic
[19:04:12] <companion_cube> I think it's cute that their homegrown browser is able to browse a real website like that
[19:09:26] <gwozniak> Yeah, I'm fine with that.  But it's just an announcement with no substance.  I'm not going to ragequit over it or anything, tho
[19:10:14] <gwozniak> Maybe I'm a bit sour because I have to debug some DWARF debug info
[19:10:37] <companion_cube> :D oops
[19:11:02] <companion_cube> the one thing serenityOS people don't do (yet?) themselves is a C++ compiler
[19:11:06] <companion_cube> that'd be‚Ä¶ fun
[19:12:11] <Brekkjern> There really should be a tag for announcements from products that we could filter out
[19:12:21] <Brekkjern> Releases doesn't quite cut it
[19:13:42] <river> we should ban all releases
[19:14:04] <river> if you care about GNU expect version 3.2.43.5 you should just subscribe to its mailing list
[19:14:09] <river> or whatever new feature xmake has

[19:17:27] <Brekkjern> Those are not really equivalent. Unless you use a tool, then the patch notes are of no interest. Blog posts can at least be interesting even if the topic isn't directly useful to you.
[19:17:50] <companion_cube> I think you can have useless blog posts, and useless release announcements
[19:17:56] <companion_cube> ofc no one cares about 3.2.43.5
[19:18:07] <gwozniak> If SerenityOS has written its own C compiler, you can be pretty certain it's not compliant with the standard
[19:18:12] <companion_cube> but sometimes releases are also interesting news in themselves. A good example is sqlite.

[19:18:37] <ngoldbaum> how insane about semver would you have to be to have a version number like 3.2.43.5
[19:18:50] <ngoldbaum> your patch releases have patch release series?
[19:18:52] <gwozniak> yeah

[19:23:31] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I think the major ones get very close.  I suspect GCC and LLVM get C99 correct (or extremely close to it)
[19:23:59] <gwozniak> But there is a whole lot of really cursed C that is incredibly tricky to parse that is allowed

[23:43:44] <skyl4rk> I've thought of that one before, well in more general terms: trying to keep a log of what I do. Never manage to keep it up though
[23:46:22] <skyl4rk> the big-ish things are "oh I will remember this easily", and in case of high value firefighting that kind of logging is a bit suppressed because, well, you're in the thick fighting fires
[23:49:52] <gwozniak> I just went through Jira tickets for the last year to remember
[23:50:01] <gwozniak> I mostly just make this stuff up anyway
[23:51:26] <gwozniak> There is some basis in reality, of course

[23:53:06] <gwozniak> I will probably never write a brag document in my life
[23:53:27] <skyl4rk> having work properly linked to tickets are a good trace I guess
[23:54:11] <skyl4rk> the interesting parts of/for me I guess is more about what is not part of the ticket log, but we're all in all not that good at using it anyway
[23:55:28] <skyl4rk> maybe instead of a brag document I should hire a hype man
