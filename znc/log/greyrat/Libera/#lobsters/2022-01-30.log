[00:01:20] <technomancy> isn't seaside the one that's totally based around continuations?
[00:01:37] <c355E3B> yes!
[00:02:31] <technomancy> building a web app based around continuations basically why HN's pagination has been broken for decades?
[00:02:44] <technomancy> *isn't building a web app...
[00:03:54] <Borisa_Johnsona> technomancy: are there things you dislike about clojure? what are they?
[00:04:55] <c355E3B> technomancy: I feel like that's more of an HN thing versus a continuation thing.
[00:05:12] <drakonis> its entirely an HN thing
[00:05:17] <drakonis> since pg is a lisp weenie
[00:05:21] <drakonis> not a scheme user
[00:05:46] <drakonis> a reminder that he wrote arc using racket so its bound to have a bunch of shit done wrong
[00:06:06] <technomancy> but like ... if you store state in memory on a runtime that can't serialize continuations that seems like you're gonna get in a situation where you A) can't use load balancers and B) can't let state survive a server restart
[00:06:24] <drakonis> also delimited continuations idk
[00:06:36] <c355E3B> So we do a lot of continuation like stuff at work and it survives updates and load balencers
[00:06:57] <c355E3B> Its not difficult, its just that a lot of the early work never was designed to survive traffic
[00:08:06] <technomancy> I didn't even know continuations existed on beam
[00:08:22] <technomancy> so I guess the difference is you need continuations that can be serialized, and the racket/arc ones can't
[00:08:32] <technomancy> Borisa_Johnsona: here's an outdated list: https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/dotfiles/tree/master/item/.gripes.org#L46
[00:08:33] <mockturtle> [ ~technomancy/dotfiles: .gripes.org - sourcehut git ] - git.sr.ht
[00:08:52] <c355E3B> You could do it for arc
[00:08:58] <c355E3B> but that takes work outside of what's been done
[00:09:06] <drakonis> lol @ nils in clojure
[00:09:20] <technomancy> Borisa_Johnsona: but nowadays it has more to do with the fact that Clojure is 100% designed for large server-side applications, which have very little overlap with the kinds of problems that actual humans have
[00:09:22] <drakonis> one would think rich hickey would take a page off scheme's book
[00:09:49] <drakonis> have you seen lokke yet technomancy?
[00:10:07] <technomancy> drakonis: IMO there is absolutely no way to do it well given the choice of runtimes and dynamic types but that doesn't mean it doesn't sting all the same
[00:10:11] <technomancy> drakonis: I don't think so

[00:12:27] <Borisa_Johnsona> technomancy: lol the nil thing jumped out to me too from watching this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg, even tho I haven't actually used clojure
[00:12:28] <mockturtle> [ Clojure Made Simple ] - www.youtube.com

[00:12:35] <drakonis> neat.
[00:12:45] <Borisa_Johnsona> but other than that, that talk is kinda convincing
[00:12:57] <technomancy> I think the only reasonable way to deal with nil on the JVM is what Ceylon did, but unfortunately Kotlin ate Ceylon's lunch
[00:13:18] <drakonis> technomancy: regarding moving .mozilla out of the way, you also need to copy .cache/mozilla
[00:13:21] <technomancy> (Kotlin's approach is still better than Java's or Clojure's and way better than Scala's)
[00:13:23] <drakonis> otherwise it forgets everything
[00:13:30] <technomancy> drakonis: haha yeah this file is very old
[00:14:12] <technomancy> Borisa_Johnsona: it's good at what it's designed to do

[00:15:29] <technomancy> anyway if you don't have a gripes file I recommend starting one
[00:15:29] <c355E3B> technomancy: I wrote a `gen_continuation` and a parse transform
[00:15:34] <technomancy> saves a lot of time when people ask questions
[00:15:44] <technomancy> c355E3B: haha you madman
[00:16:10] <c355E3B> Also note that I'm now a Staff Engineer attached to an SRE team and one of my databases is in-house entirely in c++
[00:16:11] <technomancy> c355E3B: I guess that's why seaside had to be on smalltalk, huh? it's the only other runtime where continuations can be distributed afaik
[00:16:15] <af> the question is why is your gripes file literally a . file
[00:16:18] <c355E3B> technomancy: yeah
[00:16:26] <af> I mean, it's not just in the dotfiles repo, it's literally .gripes
[00:16:30] <technomancy> af: so it can live in my home dir to always be in reach
[00:16:36] <c355E3B> It takes a ton of work to get to the point where you can use continuations, but *wow* it solves so many issues
[00:16:45] <af> no I mean why are you hiding it
[00:16:51] <c355E3B> I would make the argument that if we had decent continuations in other languages, react would have never happened
[00:16:52] <technomancy> af: fair
[00:16:54] <af> why not just gripes
[00:17:12] <technomancy> I like my ~ to have the superficial appearance of tidiness

[00:18:42] <technomancy> drakonis: I think rackjure does a decent job of bringing in some of the nicer things from clojure; like the idea that hash tables can't be called like functions is very silly

[00:19:12] <drakonis> that's a dumb thing lol
[00:19:16] <technomancy> (this is an example of one of the goofs in racket that rackjure fixes)
[00:19:24] <drakonis> racket has a lot of goofs
[00:19:31] <technomancy> but some of the stuff like making freeform maps easier to use just doesn't fit
[00:19:57] <technomancy> racket *really* wants you to use structs where all fields are known at compile-time, and you know what, if that's the cost of not having nil, it's well worth it
[00:19:58] <drakonis> its also really bad about treating langs like libraries you can call to at any time
[00:20:20] <technomancy> also the implicit quoting for vectors and hash tables is miserably bad
[00:20:47] <drakonis> i'm honestly surprised that people claim arc uses continuations lol
[00:20:57] <technomancy> #[1 2 (+ 1 3)] does not evaluate to a vector of numbers; it's sooooo bad

[00:21:30] <technomancy> bahaha
[00:21:32] <technomancy> what a tool
[00:21:45] <drakonis> a ton of procedures just get renamed
[00:22:19] <drakonis> anything with xdef is renaming procedures or assigning lambdas
[00:22:31] <companion_cube> technomancy: hashtables are, err, mutable functions? :)

[00:24:05] <drakonis> i have no idea where continuations are even used in arc or hn
[00:24:24] <drakonis> this is some miserable code
[00:24:27] <companion_cube> Probably to replace async /await
[00:24:30] <drakonis> its too fucking terse
[00:24:35] <drakonis> arc was written in 2008
[00:24:39] <drakonis> i dont even think that was available
[00:24:43] <companion_cube> Just save the continuation, and call it to resume
[00:24:49] <technomancy> but don't you know drakonis; the shorter the code is the better the language is
[00:24:53] <technomancy> it's basic arithmetic
[00:25:37] <companion_cube> Hence why everybody writes J
[00:25:43] <drakonis> also have you seen kawa?
[00:25:46] <drakonis> its scheme in java

[19:01:36] <riv> How do I do image processing on the GPU?
[19:01:52] <riv> e.g. how would I do a blur, or sharpen on a picture with GPU
[19:02:03] <riv> and get an image saved out as a PNG as a result
[19:02:19] <kline> with opencv specifically
[19:02:21] <kline> or generally
[19:02:26] <riv> ideally not opencv
[19:02:37] <riv> but if i have to use it I will
[19:03:10] <jkaye> I'd start with CUDA personally, but it depends on what you're trying to do specifically
[19:03:11] <kline> use something like opencl or cuda, which allows you to load an image into GPGPU memory, then load a kernel, then execute the kernel, then load the result back into system ram
[19:03:48] <kline> a kernel is a small program that can be run many times in parallel, though GPGPUs have specific architecture requirements for doing this efficiently
[19:04:00] <riv> this sounds good
[19:04:01] <kline> but blurring is very easy to do in parallel
[19:04:28] *** Joins: zikani03 (~zikani03@102.70.49.13)

[19:05:04] <companion_cube> pardon my ignorance, but you can also use openGL + GLSL, no?
[19:05:10] <kline> note: GPGPU stuff has an overhead, so if you're just blurring a few small images, its probably not going to be a speedup on its own
[19:05:31] <kline> companion_cube, yeah, you can use a shader
[19:06:04] <kline> im not sure how you get shader results back out, and of course shaders are not as general as GPGPU

[19:06:21] <companion_cube> hmmmm you mean it can only be displayed?
[19:06:34] <kline> opencl is very portable, it runs on nvidia, amd, and intel, including on single-core/single-thread CPUs

[20:31:37] <cypheon> that's probably a safer way to do it, but e.g. Helm (a k8s "package manager") generates YAML (using textual templates) in an attempt to keep the generated files readable and version control-friendly

[22:39:38] <wink_> ok, so I actually was a huge fan of XMPP. it replaced ICQ as a 1:1 messenger for me
[22:40:05] <wink_> and for a while we also had it at work, as a replacement for irc. but I found the multiuser chatrooms kinda atrocious
[22:40:14] <wink_> at least in all otherwise sensible clients
[22:40:21] <wink_> and completely forget about mobile at the time
[22:40:52] <wink_> I ran an xmpp for friends & family but everyone was kinda meh, and after a few years even the diehard nerds stopped using it
[22:41:08] <wink_> end of story. after that 1-2 good android clients came out
[22:41:16] <wink_> after we had forsaken it after years of usage
[22:41:19] <wink_> matrix jsut works
[22:41:49] <wink_> it may not be perfect from a protocol point of view and the default client is electron.. but it doesn't matter. it works a lot better than xmpp ever did
[22:42:49] <bsandro> i never had issues with xmpp usability-wide, maybe because I haven't tried to use it on mobile
[22:43:02] <bsandro> tkabber and some other stuff worked really well for me
[22:43:29] <wink_> 1:1 it was mostly fine, both on linux and windows
[22:43:43] <wink_> except the presence thing which could backfire
[22:45:25] <bsandro> i used bunch of groupchats too, mostly about tech and riichi mahjong :D fun times, they probably all migrated to telegram by now
