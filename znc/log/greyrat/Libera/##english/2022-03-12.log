[01:24:07] <TimMc> (plutocracy: rule by the rich)
[01:26:35] <TimMc> Calling the US a plutocracy would be an exaggeration that isn't supported by the definition, but it would be acceptable in rhetoric describing a shift in that direction.
[01:27:04] <TimMc> But opinions will also vary as to the current state.

[07:53:18] <Jong> I don't quite understand the "heh" gesture
[07:53:29] <Jong> is it like "meh"
[07:53:34] <Jong> contempt?
[07:55:15] <papna> Usually 'heh' is used for mild amusement
[07:55:49] <papna> "Meh" is used for apathetic disapproval
[07:55:50] <Jong> "I haven't slept in over 24 hours heh"
[07:56:00] <Jong> Is heh reasonable there?
[07:56:08] <CuriosTiger> meh is negative. heh is positive.
[07:56:11] <CuriosTiger> generally speaking.
[07:56:23] <CuriosTiger> of course, heh can be used sarcastically or dismissively, too.
[07:56:45] <CuriosTiger> "I'm going to become a millionaire!" "Heh."
[07:56:48] <papna> Jong: Depends on context, but not obviously a good choice there.
[07:57:24] <Jong> I was using heh as kind of a sigh sound there
[07:57:44] <papna> heh is a laugh
[07:58:52] <LuisR14> .d heh
[07:58:54] <tinsoldier> heh — Noun: 1. The fifth letter of many Semitic alphabets (Phoenician, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic and others)., — Interjection: 1. (onomatopoeia) Weak amusement, sometimes signaling boredom. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heh
[07:58:54] <Jong> so if I haven't slept in over 24 hours heh would probably be someone laughing at themselves for the sleep deprivation
[07:59:50] <papna> "You aren't making any sense at all today, what the heck is wrong with you" "I haven't slept in over 24 hours heh"
[08:01:31] <Jong> papna  that was nearly the exact conversation lol
[08:01:36] <papna> For a sigh of relief, you can use "phew". For a more general sigh, just use "*sigh*" or ":(" or, not quite a sigh sound, "blech"
[08:01:47] <Jong> papna  but you're saying heh does not make sense there?
[08:01:51] <papna> Someone there might be saying "heh, you caught me"
[08:02:09] <papna> They could have said "I haven't slept in over 24 hours haha" to similar effect
[08:02:19] <LuisR14> .d int meh
[08:02:21] <tinsoldier> meh — Interjection: 1. (slang) Expressing indifference or lack of enthusiasm. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meh
[08:02:27] <papna> It's not the same as "I haven't slept in over 24 hours *sighhhh*"
[08:02:49] <Jong> I see.
[08:03:18] <Jong> I thought heh was a very quick tired laugh. THe kind of quick laugh you do when. you're exhausted
[08:03:39] <Jong> I guess I had it wrong
[08:03:43] <Jong> thanks for correcting me papna 
[08:03:44] <papna> It's a weak chuckle, you might do it while very alert.

[17:02:26] <kurahaupo> darsie: "antonym" means "logical inversion", not "opposite" in other ways. The logical version of "backpack" is "anything that is not a backpack", including a waist pouch, a suitcase,  or a swimming fish.
[17:03:00] <kurahaupo> darsie: In practice "antonym" is mostly used for adjectives
[17:05:38] <kurahaupo> darsie: There are anatomical reasons for attaching a large load to a human back rather than anywhere else. A carrying bag attached anywhere else must be much smaller and lighter, so you can't just consider it "opposite" in the "front vs back" sense, because it is necessarily different in other ways.

[18:18:36] * CuriosTiger wanders in and locks FloridaMan inside a Wal-Mart.
[18:19:45] <CuriosTiger> FloridaMan: I think negators are the primary answer to that question, even though I recognize that's not what you're looking for.
[18:19:59] <CuriosTiger> Hopes can be dashed. Expectations can go unfulfilled -- but that's a negator again.
[18:20:07] <FloridaMan> Yeah
[18:20:21] <FloridaMan> Ok. Not a big deal actually.
[18:20:31] <FloridaMan> I guess it reflects what is actually happening.
[18:20:45] <CuriosTiger> Yeah. Not every positive word has a negative counterpart.
[18:20:51] <FloridaMan> It's not like they're actively not meeting an expectation. 
[18:21:07] <CuriosTiger> Perhaps they're actively failing to meet it.
[18:21:11] <FloridaMan> They just "fall short" I guess
[18:22:09] <CuriosTiger> I guess they do.
[18:22:16] <FloridaMan> It probably also depends on the expectation.
[18:22:23] * CuriosTiger waits to see some FloridaMan antics.
[18:22:40] <CuriosTiger> With a nickname like that, you have expectations of your own to live up to.
[18:23:08] <FloridaMan> CuriosTiger: I'm afraid you may be disappointed by my falling short of your expectation.
[18:23:28] <CuriosTiger> That's likely. But a quick google for "Florida man" will fix that.
[18:23:55] <CuriosTiger> Also, I happen to live in Florida, which by itself ensures that friends and family will share every Florida Man story they come across.
[18:24:26] <FloridaMan> I was reading some stuff about disappointment last night that got me thinking about all of this stuff.
[18:26:02] <FloridaMan> One thing I read was that often people lower their expectations so they're not disappointed, which the author went on to say is "living a disappointing life in order to avoid feeling disappointed," which I thought was a pretty powerful statement.
[18:26:09] <CuriosTiger> It's also interesting to note that disappoint does itself contain a negation process. Don't you feel appointed now.
[18:26:27] <CuriosTiger> Hrm, that statement has a Zen-like quality to it.
[18:26:33] <FloridaMan> Indeed.
[18:27:13] <CuriosTiger> I do know one individual who fits that description, and I've never understood why he does that to himself.
[18:27:55] * LuisR14 appoints himself to his feelings
[18:28:23] <FloridaMan> I feel so appointed

[23:07:26] <LuisR14> doesn't really make sense
[23:09:52] <csi615> Worker unions organised a strike.
[23:11:28] <csi615> How would you rephrase it?
[23:25:34] *** tinwhiskers_ is now known as tinwhiskers
[23:29:44] <TimMc> csi615: I don't think that tense of "to strike" gets used for unions.
[23:30:04] <TimMc> maybe "because unions were striking"
