[06:59:51] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: did Socrates ever really get to define "justice" in Plato's Republic?
[07:01:15] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: I did not like how Socrates suggested we should brainwash the young to protect the state
[07:01:51] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: yeah he defines at is everyone doing their job and only their job, the job that they are best suited for
[07:02:15] <causative> justice is when people are rewarded if they good things, and punished if they do bad things, in proportion to how good or bad the things they do are
[07:02:40] <Irishmanluke> although really it's Plato defining it that way since Socrates is dead
[07:02:46] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: that's a very different definition from the standard one

[07:03:21] <causative> even if the murder people or rob the elderly?
[07:03:22] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: but that's justice within the city which he analogizes to justice within the individual/mind
[07:03:47] <amigojapan> causative: they should be locked away from society but not punished
[07:04:09] <causative> locking them away is punishment, ugh, did we have this discussion before? don't change conventional definitions on me
[07:04:19] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: what is punishment
[07:04:32] <amigojapan> Maybe we did causative
[07:05:15] <Irishmanluke> it sounds like amigojapan is saying the point of locking them up is not to harm them but simply to keep them away from the rest of the population
[07:05:23] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: like not allowing people in jail for playing videogames or drinking alcohol is punishment which should not be
[07:05:28] <Irishmanluke> but it would cause them harm
[07:05:41] <amigojapan> Exactly Irishmanluke
[07:06:48] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: or taking it to an extreme. Torture should never happen
[07:07:56] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: what if you could give them a small prick of the finger but after pricking their finger they would no longer commit any crimes for fear of getting their finger pricked again, and that way you wouldn't have to lock them up which would arguably cause them more harm and cost more to society in the long run
[07:08:12] <Irishmanluke> would you believe in punishment in that situation

[07:14:35] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: I am for deterants
[07:15:04] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: the question is what sort of deterants are permissable then
[07:15:29] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: maybe fines
[07:16:08] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: not prison?
[07:16:40] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: I think prison as a deterrent is too extreme

[07:19:09] <Irishmanluke> amigojapan: people sometimes commit crimes that are much worse than being held in prision
[07:19:26] <amigojapan> Irishmanluke: here in Japan it has gone to the extreme where you can go 10 years to prison for getting pirated things from torrents
