I know that it has something to do with using requests_oauthlib and possibly patreon-python (because I'm trying to log into patreon), but the examples I keep finding don't seem to describe what I'm trying to do

[00:23:18] <schemanic[m]> so OliverUK , I have no idea what a 'redirect url' is supposed to be. I understand that in the OAuth workflow it's where the program is supposed to return a user, but I can't find any information that explains the following "When you are writing a python script that you intend to call on the command line, you should register X as the redirect url (insert the explanation for why that is the correct url)

[00:27:41] <schemanic[m]> I don't really understand which thing I'm supposed to be trying to authenticate to - am I trying to access Patreon with the client_id and client_secret I've generated in my patreon account, and somehow indicating that I should be using my google credentials (somewhere) in that workflow (I can't find an example of how), or am I authenticating not to patreon at all? Is it understood that my google account already has the authorization it
[00:27:41] <schemanic[m]> needs from my trust-on-first-access interaction in the browser when I signed in to Patreon the first time? Do I need to be setting up a client in Google and using THAT to authenticate?

[06:31:53] <SnoopJ> nedbat, it seems that the error upon which blei is predicting the end of PyPy is caused by the computation of .nbytes on range objects: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/core/indexes/range.py#L311-L320  I would not think that's load-bearing code, but perhaps it is used elsewhere.
[06:33:18] <nedbat> blei: i imagine the library maintainers would be willing to deal with these issues.
[06:33:43] <blei> i don't know. it looks like it's inside a memory usage model. its not possible to predict memory usage on linux, you have to use heuristics. which they are doing

[07:17:13] <freefall> grid and pack would automaticly taken care of this but i havent figure out how to use those method to place things
[07:17:31] <deltab> freefall: you need to tell .place to relate the scrollbar to the list box, using in_, anchor, x, y, height
[07:17:46] <quartz> hogarius: Oh, well that seems to have fixed it
[07:17:52] <quartz> But why? what difference did it make
[07:17:55] <freefall> well that turn a light bulb on
[07:18:10] <freefall> thought anchor was just a grid or whatever use only
[07:18:12] <blei> pyevery__ i don't have time for that. start with an example from the docs and modify it until it works for your use case. use tensorboard to visualize your network and debug
[07:18:16] <SnoopJ> callen92, bubble_sort() and insertion_sort() do not return anything explicitly. The implicit return value of all functions is None unless they specify otherwise.
[07:18:17] <deltab> the .winfo_height() method can give you the height of the list box
[07:18:48] <hogarius> quartz: {} denotes a dict.  [] denotes a list.
[07:19:08] *** Joins: rinzewind (~rinzewind@user/rinzewind)
[07:19:14] <freefall> so anchor can be point to what the listbox name would be
[07:19:24] <SnoopJ> callen92, so at Line 31 of that paste (which is not Line 31 of your program because the paste is incomplete) where you do `sample = first_function(first_list)`, you are storing the value None because that's what the function returns (because you never returned anything else)
[07:20:19] <deltab> freefall: looks like anchor sets which part of the widget is considered to be (0, 0)
[07:20:40] <callen92> I was just seeing what happened if I stored the returned value to a variiable instead of just getting the return, in both cases it was none

[07:21:02] <deltab> freefall: so you can have the scrollbar centered on the corner of the list box, for instance
[07:21:10] <freefall> i thought place an pack couldnt be use together

[07:21:22] <quartz> Stupid clown of a professor still teaches JQuery in 2022
[07:21:34] <SnoopJ> callen92, when you do that, you'll store the value under that name, but only in the scope of the calling function. This read might help clear things up if you find names and assignment confusing: https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html
[07:22:10] <deltab> freefall: both of them set the x, y, width, height of a widget; using both just means that one overrides the other

[08:33:59] <MeanEYE> You can have 0 stars and still make good code.
[08:34:05] <MeanEYE> From what I can see it works.

[08:36:02] <BASHitup> No, I just wanted someone to give me an idea of how accurate that code probably is in terms of the ouput e.g., is it likely the output is false?

[16:52:56] <mnhrdt> the concrete case is numpy, scipy sparse, and some very specific fancy solvers
[16:53:00] <InPhase> mnhrdt: I do it when I want functions to be extractable text for sharing/reuse, or when I want them to be extractable for parallelizing via one of the methods that sends function text across a cluster.  There's a price in determining the dependencies, a price in terms of missing dependencies causing failures on delay, and a price in terms of the load-time lags being delayed to the first run of a function.
[16:53:06] <InPhase>  But there are some side-bonuses that you only actually have dependencies then for the functions you actually call, so you might end up with a library with optional dependencies, and optional time spent loading dependencies.
[16:53:17] <mnhrdt> the fancy solver is just used in one function, I want people to be able to use the other functions even when they can't install the fancy solver

[18:17:33] <bjs> libh: if you give someone some .py file to run, they can just open the .py file and change what it says

[18:18:28] <Wooble> if this "someone" has that much access to the user's filesystem, they've already lost and whatever they do specifically to your script doesn't make much difference
[18:18:32] <The-Compiler> libh: to expand on what exarkun said: you will need a concrete idea of what you want to prevent. If someone can launch your Python script, they might as well launch something else instead of your application anyways, no?
[18:18:45] <marduk> Indeed, you don't even have to give them the .py file. They can write their own.

[18:19:26] <bjs> libh: I mean the attacker can just open foo.py and change what the code says, it's not really an SQL injection because here you're giving the user the code (the .py file)
[18:20:05] <libh> If I could clear things up a bit, I intended for this to be on unix systems (or unix like systems) that would have the python scripts installed where admin rights would be required to change in the first place. Such as under /usr/bin/.
[18:20:25] <The-Compiler> libh: this kind of thing only becomes problematic if your script allows a user to do things they could not otherwise do. Like with the SQL injection you mention, where an user of your web application can access the web server in ways they should not be able to.
