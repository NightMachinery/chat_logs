[00:00:13] <iamtheworstdev> here's what I was trying to follow - https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/developing_react_inside_docker/
[00:00:20] <iamtheworstdev> seems like he didn't have the issue at all
[00:01:12] <iamtheworstdev> i'm not at all a docker expert.. i'm just tired of trying to keep three different computers (that I do my work from) in sync.. and figured since I have a server sitting around doing nothing maybe I could host a docker development environment and just remote in
[00:01:23] <iamtheworstdev> and VPN in when I'm no the road
[00:02:52] <Lutin> I run into this issue...I need IPv6 it seems... but how why to fix that ? https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-container/issues/298 
[00:03:38] <rawtaz> yeah using docker for dev envs is something i couldnt live without
[00:06:10] <iamtheworstdev> rawtaz, got a recommended writeup on how to make that happen well? i'm pretty new to docker
[00:06:25] <iamtheworstdev> aside from making some docker images that I deploy through AWS.. I've never really worked 'inside' of one
[00:06:27] <rawtaz> i just use Docker for Mac and it works out of the box
[00:06:31] <rawtaz> let me check a server i have
[00:08:26] <rawtaz> most of the bind mount files are created with root as owner and group ther etoo
[00:08:31] <rawtaz> err, there*
[00:08:37] <rawtaz> on my mac they're my own local user
[00:09:06] <rawtaz> cant you just adjust the filesystem permissions? what is the actual problem you are having? you never responded to that i think
[00:10:01] <Lutin> when people use a mac... I quit ;D
[00:13:40] <iamtheworstdev> i feel like what's happening is it's failing to write to the node_modules volume
[00:15:11] <rawtaz> ...
[00:15:36] <rawtaz> if oyu have a problem, show the exact symptoms of it, otherwise we'll just be speculating ;)

[00:16:42] <iamtheworstdev> ultimate when i launch the `yarn start` command I'm getting : EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/node_modules/.cache'
[00:17:14] <rawtaz> what does `ls -l /app/node_modules/.cache` say?
[00:17:18] <rawtaz> about that folder
[00:17:19] <iamtheworstdev> it looks like it creates the node_modules as root:root
[00:17:30] <iamtheworstdev> and perms keep me from writing to it
[00:18:14] <iamtheworstdev>  docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -v testapp_nodemodules:/app/node_modules --user 1000 --network host testapp $@
[00:18:19] <iamtheworstdev> but i'm trying to pass in my uid
[00:19:39] <rawtaz> i would just start hte container and enter it and inspect what permissions there are on that path it's trying to write to, for starters

[00:29:17] <iamtheworstdev> oh god. ignore the 1086 bit
[00:29:46] <rawtaz> so the files something in the container is trying to write to are owned by root and what group?
[00:29:57] <iamtheworstdev> root:root
[00:30:10] <rawtaz> and what user:group is the thing that tries to write to it running as?
[00:30:13] <iamtheworstdev> everything else is node:node
[00:30:27] <iamtheworstdev> (node:14 is the base image here)
[00:30:29] <rawtaz> im guessing node:node then. the Dockerfile would tell
[00:31:01] <rawtaz> so you have a mismatch there. you have to make the user:group match on either side
[00:31:32] <rawtaz> one thing you can do is find out the uid and gid of the node user and group inside the container, then chown -R the files to that on the host
[00:31:37] *** Quits: PeGaSuS_ (~James@user/pegasus) (Remote host closed the connection)

[00:40:28] <iamtheworstdev> looks like it's not getting mounted maybe?
[00:40:48] <iamtheworstdev> so the container is just creating a node_modules directory and it's being created improperly?

[00:43:47] <iamtheworstdev> there is where I don't fully understand what I'm doing
[00:43:55] <iamtheworstdev> I don't technically have a container running.. I'm just running an image?
[00:44:03] <iamtheworstdev> because `docker container ls` reports back nothing
[01:00:25] <tabakhase> iamtheworstdev add a "-a" to that
[01:04:34] <iamtheworstdev> the only one it shows is an old homeassistant image
[01:09:41] <rawtaz> iamtheworstdev: its not the same thing but for purposes of concept; imagine the image being the virtual disk file of a VM, and imagine the container being the VM that you start with the image as its harddrive
[01:10:05] <rawtaz> iamtheworstdev: instead of describing what you see, pastebin the actual command and its output
[01:10:13] <rawtaz> to avoid any misunderstandings
[01:11:26] <rawtaz> iamtheworstdev: if you just run that docker command you have in https://gist.github.com/iamtheworstdev/d21436911dead1af5a05b88783bff9e5 then your container starts and the prompt just sits there i take it. then open another terminal window and `docker ps` should show you whats running

[04:57:17] <Alys> Alright. That's good to know. I was also looking at Ghost and it says I have to pass special options if I want to use it behind a proxy. I thought FPM might be a different image that I needed to use when behind a proxy. But I look now and see Ghost doesn't have any FPM tags. And I understand what you're saying: Use the FPM image when I want to use a separate web service instead of having one built into the image.
[04:58:00] <rawtaz> Alys: fpn is not about separate web services, but it could be :P
[04:58:03] <rawtaz> err fpm
[04:58:26] <rawtaz> Alys: are you at all looking at something that is driven by php? if not, fpm isnt relevant to you at this point
