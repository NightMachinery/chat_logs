[00:13:20] <evolv> progress is a nebulous term

[00:14:24] <kmh> ok

[00:29:12] <evolv> I'm not anti-STEM, rationalism, empiricism, etc.
[00:29:26] <evolv> it's more of the motivating factors

[00:35:33] <mnemon> arguably STEM can be affected less as there is usually less applicable dogma outside of specific things/fields
[00:36:09] <evolv> religion doesn't get in the way of social progress more than any other class of ideologies
[00:36:23] <evolv> there is a lot of dogma in STEM
[00:36:27] <mnemon> it is by nature dogmatic and resistant to change
[00:36:37] <evolv> not at all
[00:36:45] <mnemon> because it invariably claims to have answers
[00:37:07] <evolv> one classic example wsa the competition between gnosticism and Catholicism
[00:37:19] <mnemon> I mean religious dogma interfering with progress in STEM vs. social side
[00:37:27] <evolv> gnosticism was defeated and Catholicism became orthodox
[00:37:45] <evolv> heh, STEM interferes with itself more than religion
[00:39:44] <evolv> currently, the biggest crises in the sciences, and I'm narrowing to natural sciences, involves the replication crisis, misuse of statistics, broken peer-review system, positive results bias
[00:41:00] <evolv> then the ideologies churned out from STEM enthusiasts
[00:42:29] <mnemon> those are all amplified by the subversion of religion and to some degree also other unrelated ideals
[00:42:44] <evolv> not in the West
[00:42:52] <evolv> religion (Christianity) is more or less contained
[00:43:07] <mnemon> also in the west, even if to significantly lesser degree than before
[00:43:14] <evolv> how so?

[14:37:48] <arryana> go through your house and find everything made of plastic, wood, wicker, or leather
[14:37:54] <arryana> then chew that shit up yourself, because it's -going-

[14:38:19] <arryana> my dogs speak english with perfect clarity
[14:38:23] <arryana> the cat only says three words
[14:38:27] <pussipupu> Depends on the plastic

[14:41:49] <DPA> They can make clear what they want in other ways. When they want outside (and are too lazy to go to the cat dor), they go to a dor and meow. They may also lead you places.
[14:41:49] <DPA> And they have a way to tell without saying anything if they want to play, want to be petted, don't want any of that, etc.

[14:47:12] <DPA> When my sister visits with her dog, and I enter the same floor, it just wont stop barking until I either leave the floor or sit on a chair. (Standing back up usually results in getting barked at again.)
[14:47:58] <arryana> either that's a poorly behaved dog or you're so emotionally unbalanced that you freak it out.  i can't guess which is the case, knowing neither of you
[14:48:05] <DPA> It reacts mostly the same way to the cats.
[14:48:20] <arryana> my dogs have more manners than to bark at cats.

[14:49:00] * arryana shrugs
[14:49:11] <arryana> maybe it's a particularly loaded situation at your place.  can't say from the outside.
[14:49:32] <DPA> I thinks the dog wants us to interact with it, but we (I and the cats) don't want to.
[14:49:53] <pussipupu> barks at the cats or to them?
[14:49:59] <arryana> i can't say that i'd invite a guest and then ignore thenm.
[14:50:18] <pussipupu> the odd woof as a conversation starter isn't barking at
[14:50:33] <DPA> I ignore only the dog. I don't like dogs.
[14:51:23] <arryana> that's rather rude.
[14:51:30] <arryana> the dog is a person too.
[14:51:47] <DPA> It's a dog and it's loud.
[14:52:03] * arryana shrugs
[14:52:06] <arryana> it's still a person.
[14:52:55] <arryana> i don't see why it's so hard for you to consider a dog a person when you seem to have no problem considering cats people.
[14:53:43] <DPA> I think that depends on what you understand people to be.
[14:53:49] * arryana shrugs
[14:56:09] <DPA> It's a spitz. They are very small but loud & active dogs. Did you know dogs can't become tired of barking? It's impressive.
[14:56:24] <arryana> that's silly.
[14:56:34] <arryana> it's clear that your attitude is the issue.  good luck with that.
[14:57:37] <DPA> Why does the dog care about me anyway? I'd think it should get bored of me at some opint if I never do anything.
[14:57:50] <DPA> *point
[14:58:01] * arryana shrugs
[14:58:15] <arryana> it doesn't really matter what i tell you.  your attitude isn't going to change.
[14:58:59] <DPA> The cats sometimes go up and down the stairs repeatedly. The dog isn't allowed to. I think they tease him.
[15:04:09] <DPA> Interestingly, the dog only barks at the cats and at me at my home. Outside, or if I visit her, it's fine.

[16:06:30] <DPA> Catching a demon could result in big breakthroughs in science. As they are, as far as we now, not real / non-existent, if they do exist after all, we'd have to explain them, which would mean we get new exciting physics. That would be newsworthy.

[17:54:22] <Digit> and the name "COVID19" showing up in government documents at least as early as 2015, and the leak of some middling insider years ago saying something like "when the terrorist thing wears off, we're going to have people running scared of a virus without symptoms", and ... ok i'll stop.

[17:57:43] <mnemon> Digit: considering national socialism was explicitly an attempt at creating nationalistic socialist state(as opposed to the "international" one espoused by marxist leninists of the time) it's not all that newspeaky.
[17:57:49] <Digit> yeah, it's terrible.  more than half the doctor-pundits i subscribe to, are oft mentioning how irk'd they are at having to be cagey with how they word things to avoid censorship.  and /all/ of the geneticists and virologist i was subscribed to are simply gone/disapeared.
[17:58:44] <Digit> mnemon: it was a mislabel.   it was neither national, nor socialist.  it was more a jingoist hegemony or .. idk what you'd call it.  totalitarianism?  fascism?  it had nnnnno intent of acheiving socialism's aspirations.
[18:01:17] <Digit> i mean, if you've got a plan to do all kinds of attrocities, calling it "we'll enslave you and have you commit attrocities for us, and we'll many of kill you, and then more and more of you, narrower and narrower"-party.  you'd call it "kittens and cream"-party.   ..... and then, tragically, decades/generations later, there'd be people who believe that mislabel, and think kittens and cream are those attrocities, never realising how nice
[18:01:18] <Digit> kittens and cream are, and how they're NOT like the mislabel had them imagine.
[18:01:41] <mnemon> it was a break from liberal individualism and capitalism towards "common good" gov driven society without embracing many of the features of marxism.
