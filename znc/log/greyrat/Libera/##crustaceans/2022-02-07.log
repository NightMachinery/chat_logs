[08:11:04] <kline> whats the issue
[08:11:23] <imode> the pipe character is on the left hand side, merged with the shift button. there is a gigantic vertical enter.
[08:11:41] <imode> which is also merged.. with tilde?
[08:11:44] <imode> what layout is this?
[08:12:15] <imode> UK?
[08:12:24] <imode> oh that is so weird.
[08:12:28] <kline> yes
[08:12:35] <kline> tall-enter is pretty common
[08:12:38] <imode> aaaaa that is so weird.
[08:13:09] <imode> I really wonder why there are differences there.
[08:13:46] <imode> like, what's the origin of both designs. it'd be neat to trace that back, because that just looks incredibly weird to me.
[08:13:56] <imode> ..but I might actually get used to that if I do a lot of piping.. hm.
[08:18:11] <imode> Xe: I don't think there's a flag but you should just be able to use `sha256sum -c` if you have the sum.
[08:21:55] <Church> Xe: Can pipe to tee and then pipe to md5sum it sha256sum, save it to a file and then check against the file later.
[08:22:33] <kline> imode, the wide enter is ANSI keyboard, the tall enter is ISO

[17:24:15] <gerikson> LOL
[17:25:36] <kline> gwozniak, nice
[17:25:44] <kline> i hear its officially a public emergency now
[17:25:48] <kline> not covid, just the riots
[17:26:05] <gwozniak> Yeah, Ottawa declared a state of emergency
[17:26:21] <gwozniak> Keep in mind that "Ottawa" here does not mean the federal government
[17:26:24] <Geekingfrog> wat wat wat?
[17:26:42] <gerikson> bet they had to dig deep in the rule book for that
[17:27:12] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/convoy-protest-ottawa-sunday-impasse-1.6341548
[17:27:59] <gwozniak> ``Shortly after announcing that Ottawa Police would be cracking down on the protesters' fuel supply, one of the protest organizers said they would find a way around the police action.''
[17:28:04] <Geekingfrog> What are the protests about ?
[17:28:27] <gwozniak> Supposedly about the vaccine mandates and Covid restrictions
[17:28:40] <Geekingfrog> oh, antivax protesting then?
[17:28:59] <gwozniak> But it's really more a low-key sedition thing by a bunch of right-wing nutjobs
[17:29:26] <gwozniak> The federal gov't does not set health policies. The provinces do.
[17:30:02] <gwozniak> So protesting and blockading the feds does nothing, if they really wanted the restrictions to go away
[17:31:18] <gwozniak> This started as a trucker convoy to protest the vaccine requirements for crossing the border into the US, but the truckers seem to have missed the fact that the US has the same restrictions, so the truckers wouldn't be able to cross the border without quarantining anyway
[17:32:00] <gwozniak> There was a GoFundMe started by the right-wing crazies who are not involved in the trucking industry at all
[17:32:28] <gwozniak> And a bunch of foreign money was pumped into it.  GoFundMe has since frozen the money
[17:32:52] <Xe> i'm pretty sure gofundme is a money laundering gig
[17:33:09] <gerikson> interesting
[17:33:15] <gerikson> very possible
[17:33:22] <kline> Xe, gofundme as a platform or this specific campaign
[17:33:36] <gwozniak> It got $10MM in funds.  If you follow Canadian fundraisers, that's an insane amount
[17:33:40] <Xe> kline: yes
[17:33:56] <Xe> gwozniak: that's almost 33 cents from every canadian citizen
[17:34:02] <Xe> er
[17:34:04] <Xe> resident
[17:34:06] <kline> Xe, i think probably not the platform but in general id like to live in a world where gofundme doesnt need to be used by the average citizen
[17:34:06] <Xe> like
[17:37:47] <gwozniak> Even the conservative commentators I see are saying this a complete joke and that the Ottawa police fucked up bad
[17:38:50] <gwozniak> ``Webex in North America restored''  Yay, I guess.
[17:40:13] <epilys> this protest, is it trailer park boys crowd?
[17:41:13] <gwozniak> Probably not far off
[17:42:46] <gwozniak> Also, keep in mind that 90% of truckers in Canada are vaccinated and trucking industry groups do not support the convoy
[17:42:53] <gerikson> I saw Doug Ford denouncing them
[17:48:12] <gwozniak> Yeah, he took his time, but he is against them
[17:49:38] <gerikson> is he as batshit as his late brother?
[18:01:33] <gwozniak> No, he is not nearly as reckless

[20:40:51] <imode> well I'm a happy fucking camper.
[20:43:16] <defect> and the other levels are getting adjust too?
[20:43:21] <defect> adjusted*
[20:44:24] <imode> looks like it.
[20:44:43] <defect> sweet
[20:51:55] <imode> I know a guy who's basically never sold any of his AMZN stock.
[20:52:05] <imode> since he joined, and he's roughly a lifer. 10+ years.
[20:54:05] <manicennui> So he could probably retire now.
[20:54:19] <manicennui> imode: Did they actually adjust your salary?
[20:54:36] <imode> if they aren't they're about to get a demand e-mail.
[20:54:57] <manicennui> Is this implying that no one could have a base pay higher than $160k?
[20:55:09] <imode> yup.
[20:55:12] <manicennui> That's insane.
[20:55:15] <imode> no base salary higher than $160k.
[20:55:20] <manicennui> I know people in Chicago making more than that in base salary.
[20:55:22] <imode> all backloaded with signing bonuses and stock grants.
[20:55:32] <imode> yeah, welcome to why I make enough to just stay.
[20:55:38] <imode> I make $120k base!
[20:55:47] <imode> my TC doesn't even touch the base salary cap!
[20:56:02] <bkero> wat
[20:56:02] <manicennui> Sheesh.
[20:56:08] <bkero> time to go talk to your manager
[20:56:14] <imode> ooooohhhh yeah baby it's time.
[20:56:22] <imode> especially after 2 years.
[20:56:47] <manicennui> I feel like it only really makes sense if you are really early in your career.
[20:57:21] <manicennui> I had a coworker who went to Amazon and immediately made quite a bit more plus the signing bonus.
[20:57:56] <manicennui> I believe it is 2 years before you don't have to pay back your signing bonus?
[20:58:03] <imode> a year for me.
[20:58:09] <manicennui> Ah.
[20:58:09] <imode> so I'm just making base right now.
[20:58:21] <manicennui> I get 15%+ bonus *every* year.
[20:58:31] <imode> I do not. :)
[20:58:36] <manicennui> My "target" is 10%.
[20:58:39] <manicennui> But I always get more.
[20:58:46] <manicennui> And I get 15% RSUs now.
[20:58:59] <manicennui> Our stock is nothing like AMZN though.
[20:59:23] <manicennui> I guess it could be worth it right now while AMZN is doing really well
[20:59:37] <imode> tell me about it. my stock's value more than doubled.
[20:59:48] <imode> but it's not worth anything if it vests during a CRASH.
[20:59:55] <manicennui> But it'd have to be a substantial chunk too.
[20:59:57] * defect cries in FB
[21:00:26] <imode> oh fuck you're the FB guy.
[21:00:36] * imode pats defect on the back.
[21:01:07] <manicennui> I'm fairly certain that several of my coworkers make more than $160k base.
[21:01:20] <manicennui> And they are a level above me, so their RSU % is higher.
[21:01:53] <manicennui> I bet Amazon won't raise people's salaries unless they ask.
[21:02:03] <ngoldbaum> defect: clearly they should have changed the ticket symbol last year
[21:02:05] <manicennui> Probably just did this for people who were right at the cutoff and thinking about leaving.
[21:02:19] <imode> if I don't get a comp adjustment by at least the amount of inflation over my base salary I'm probably leaving.
[21:02:53] <defect> ngoldbaum: at least it's not going to be MVRS..
[21:03:03] <manicennui> Ah, the article indicates that you are in your annual review process now.
[21:03:05] <imode> $150k/yr base would be dreamy in terms of financial stability.
[21:03:07] <imode> yeah we are.
[21:03:13] <manicennui> We are too.
[21:03:17] <manicennui> My meeting is Friday.
[21:03:30] <manicennui> I was told that I was getting a substantial increase, but we'll see.
[21:03:49] <manicennui> My employer loves to wait until a bunch of people leave the company to admit that maybe their "market analysis" is bullshit.
[21:03:58] <ngoldbaum> $150k/yr seems kinda low for a MAAAN company in 2022 tbh
[21:04:13] <imode> yeah but that's on top of stock.
[21:04:20] <manicennui> It seems low as fuck for people making Amazon a fuckton of money.
[21:04:30] <imode> I made almost $161k/yr gross last year.
[21:04:38] <imode> $156k after taxes.
[21:04:42] <manicennui> imode: That's still low as fuck.
[21:04:45] <imode> yes it is.
[21:04:47] <imode> buuuuut.
[21:04:52] <manicennui> You only paid $5k in taxes?
[21:04:54] <manicennui> heh
[21:05:11] <imode> bahaha, no. I paid $30k in taxes.
[21:05:32] <imode> aw fuck yeah my manager just posted the link.
[21:05:48] <ngoldbaum> also FAANG is now MAAAN, deal with it
[21:06:01] <imode> I work for the MAAAN.
[21:06:08] <manicennui> When they talk to you it will be all, "This has been a challenging year due to the pandemic. We had to give everyone smaller raises."
[21:06:17] <imode> they haven't given me ANY RAISES.
[21:06:32] <imode> I made $7.3k last month!
[21:06:37] <manicennui> I have gotten a raise every year for the last 7 years.
[21:06:46] <manicennui> Usually 5% or more.
[21:06:58] <imode> my only saving grace right now is that I have 16 shares vesting this fucking year.
[21:07:03] <manicennui> My worst raise was about 3%.
[21:07:07] <manicennui> That only happened once.
[21:07:35] <imode> assuming AMZN stays at $3,100 when I sell that's roughly $50k.
[21:07:48] <imode> so $50k + $120k base is $200k.
[21:07:53] <imode> err, $170k.
[21:07:56] <manicennui> I have some RSUs vesting this week.
[21:08:08] <manicennui> Yeah, that's decent... for the midwest.
[21:08:09] <imode> close enough to $200k where I'll have a good year.
[21:08:25] <manicennui> Wouldn't want to live in Seattle on that.
[21:08:26] <imode> yeah. which is why this comp adjustment thing comes at the RIGHT TIME~
[21:08:30] <manicennui> Sorry dude.
[21:08:49] <imode> it may be one of the first times since I joined that I can negotiate for a larger increase in base pay and potentially a bonus.

[21:10:27] <imode> he can afford it.

[21:11:19] <manicennui> His boat that costs more than you and all of your ancestors and descendants will make in several lifetimes.
[21:11:54] <manicennui> That he will probably use a handful of times per year.
[21:12:36] <imode> don't remind me, I already want to eat him.
[21:12:50] <manicennui> Have you ever seen him in person?
[21:13:43] <imode> no. but my god if I did I have a feeling I'd commit a felony.
[21:13:58] <imode> they said he might be present at my indoctrination.

[21:28:07] <imode> thanks man.
[21:30:25] <manicennui> Was just looking at how much stock our CEO sells.
[21:30:27] <manicennui> Holy fuck.
[21:31:03] <manicennui> It's hard to imagine selling multiples of my annual salary in stock each month.
[21:31:38] <manicennui> And he has very little to do with the product I work on, which makes like 40% of our revenue.
[21:31:50] <manicennui> Used to be far higher before a recent acquisition.
[21:34:48] <cb> riv: if you want an older movie, one of my favs is true stories - a movie with basically no conflict at all, just weird and pleasant things happening and sbtle discussion about the suburbs of texas, plus a talking heads soundtrack
[21:35:04] <riv> sounds perfect, thank you :)
[21:35:08] <cb> one of the few western examples (since it's more common in japan) for things likeOD that
[21:35:26] <manicennui> It's hard to think of entirely pleasant movies that are really good.
[21:35:35] <cb> it's very insightful as much as it is fun
[21:35:42] <manicennui> There is almost always at least one tragedy.
[21:36:45] <manicennui> I suppose there are some comedies where the bad things that happen are pretty lighthearted.
[21:37:04] <manicennui> Watched Stripes again recently.
[21:37:13] <bkero> Coffee & Cigarettes
[21:37:17] <manicennui> It falls into that category.
[21:37:38] <imode> riv: ghibli movies are typically pleasant.

[22:32:28] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/z1dm4eab0fg81.jpg
[22:33:03] <manicennui> They do the same style in the bathrooms and kitchens of every house they flip.
[22:33:20] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Eh. It wasn't really worth it in the past.
[22:33:28] <manicennui> You had to make that much to afford to live where those companies are.
[22:33:37] <Brekkjern> Ofc
[22:34:04] <manicennui> It's a bit different now if they offer similar salaries for remote jobs.
[22:34:15] <manicennui> But I think a lot of people do it for their resumes.
[22:34:27] <Brekkjern> I live in Norway anyhow, and I am not sure they would pay me enough to want to move away from here, so...
[22:34:27] <manicennui> And many people assume that the work there will be exciting.
[22:34:36] <manicennui> But the average Google employee is going to work on AdWords or something.
[22:35:24] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I am pretty happy not working on systems like that
[22:36:24] <riv> there are *few* things I would not do for money
[22:36:30] <riv> adwords is one of them
[22:36:41] <manicennui> I'd do it for enough money.
[22:36:42] <Brekkjern> And the rest of that list?
[22:36:46] <manicennui> But it would have to be remote.
[22:36:54] <manicennui> And I doubt that the work/life balance is good.
[22:42:16] <manicennui> I wonder how much flippers spend in remodeling to increase the cost by $200k.
[22:42:23] <manicennui> I'm guessing under $100k.

[23:53:26] <Brekkjern> I love how the time remaining counter is increasing for the resilvering process, but the progress counter has moved 50% over a day
[23:53:44] <Brekkjern> According to the time remaining counter it should still be over 48 hours until this process is done
[23:57:13] <imode> see you in May.
[23:57:49] <Brekkjern> I hope it will be done before that
