[20:26:38] <pussipupu> Ah, fair enough I don't think I know the song
[20:27:12] <arryana> omg, pussipupu... if your other half does not already do tunisian crochet, i highly recommend it
[20:27:20] <arryana> it's like the best parts of knitting and the best parts of crochet
[20:31:31] <pussipupu> Certainly looks interesting, thanks
[20:31:39] <pussipupu> and they don't know it as is happens
[20:31:44] <arryana> oooh
[20:31:53] <arryana> new magic wands!
[20:34:18] <pussipupu> Might experiment with printing some to be fair
[20:34:27] <pussipupu> Though I doubt they'd last well
[20:35:02] <arryana> hm, it'd be worth a try

[20:57:26] <audreyxmas> I watched Eyes Wide Shut yesterday
[20:57:37] <audreyxmas> does anyone else who's watched the film think the ending is a major let-down
[20:57:42] <arryana> yes
[20:57:44] <arryana> very much so
[21:01:17] <arryana> parts of that movie had potential
[21:01:21] <arryana> then they just walked away from it

[21:08:11] <arryana> the best movie i've seen in a long time is seat 25, but it's a cerebral movie, there's no action in it
[21:08:53] <arryana> not even much in the way of dialogue
[21:09:40] <audreyxmas> arryana: like if they just cut out the last scene where they're going christmas shopping and let it end when Tom Cruise comes back and sees the mask on the bed next to his wife
[21:09:44] <audreyxmas> that would have been so much more powerful
[21:10:05] <audreyxmas> but Kubrick fell for the "happy ending"
[21:12:48] <arryana> i hate that.
[21:12:57] <arryana> it's cliche, hackneyed, and unrealistic
[21:17:02] <maplefinger> I, too, am filled with hatred over this garbage called happiness
[21:17:25] <maplefinger> Everyone knows it is a lie.
[21:18:30] <maplefinger> You are doomed to be miserable, and you know it.
