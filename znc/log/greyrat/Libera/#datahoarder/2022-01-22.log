[01:29:06] <ThePendulum> we have this NFT guy in #web that is like a broken record
[01:29:39] <Hydragyrum> isn't that like all nft guys
[01:29:53] <imMute> Hydragyrum: yep.
[01:29:58] <ThePendulum> every single fucking day he starts out bragging about how he's making bank selling some seriously mediocre 'art', inevitably going to get rich soon, however we need to understand all of this is purely for the benefit of the poor artist and not just a selfish interest to get rich quick
[01:30:21] <ThePendulum> and it ends with "hahahaha you don't get it lololol you'll see where you'll be as a useless web designer in a few years lololol /ignore"
[01:30:53] <superkuh> Ask him how his chia coin farm is going.
[01:30:56] <Hydragyrum> these nftbros don't seem to realize that digital artists were making money just fine long before nfts
[01:30:58] <ThePendulum> so far he was supposed to be rich by christmas, then by NYE, currently he has quit his job and is still saying he'll be rich /soon/
[01:31:28] <evilgohan2> heh, meanwhile, was it crypto.com that had people's wallets mysteriously losing holdings the other day?
[01:31:44] <ThePendulum> some artists might be able to get rich, however it /still/ has fuck-all to do with their talent or skill in the actual art
[01:32:03] <joepie91> ThePendulum: why does that guy not get banned

[01:32:46] <imMute> honestly the biggest mic drop re: NFTs and artists is the fact that artist commissioning has been a thing for literally centuries.  AND you get the keep the art.  AND you get to have a say in what the art IS.
[01:33:02] <ThePendulum> joepie91: tbf it's in the off-topic channel, not #web itself
[01:33:16] <joepie91> shitty behaviour is shitty behaviour
[01:33:17] <joepie91> offtopic or not
[01:33:38] <evilgohan2> no, my favorite is how people are going  onto deviant art, minting someone else's art as their own, and then sending DMCA strikes to the original artists on Deviant Art whilst selling their work.

[01:36:30] <joepie91> what you are describing would be far beyond my threshold

[01:37:35] <joepie91> I'm not concerned about what he does
[01:37:43] <joepie91> I'm concerned about the lurkers he's pulling into the scam
[01:37:56] <joepie91> because this is pretty much how the whole thing gets marketed
[01:38:15] <joepie91> roughly the same mechanism the alt-right users
[01:38:18] <joepie91> uses*
[01:38:38] <ThePendulum> I'm not sure if it's better to ban him and have those people potentially get into crypto elsewhere, or have them read us absoluting bashing the shit out of him everytime he brings it up
[01:39:06] <joepie91> s/crypto/fascism/ and you're talking about the alt right

[01:40:02] <joepie91> arguing is the point
[01:40:21] <joepie91> it's how the whole thing gets attention and airtime and how it makes people feel like they're missing out, because people are constantly talking and arguing about it so it must be something important
[01:40:41] <joepie91> this is why you don't dunk on cryptobros on twitter but ignore/block them
[01:41:13] <evilgohan2> in that sentence, crpytobros is replaceable with so many things

[01:41:39] <evilgohan2> Cool. Congrats. You just gave the person you're dunking on free engagement and spread.
[01:41:49] <evilgohan2> Well done.
[01:44:51] <evilgohan2> heh, I actually learned a lot from this article. I wasn't aware of the degree to which tether played a role here, and how it and of itself is a house of cards. Unfortunately, what this writer fails to account for is sheer stupidity. The writer indicates that if people lose faith in tether, the whole thing crumbles - whilst simultaneously outlining how tether can't even back itself. That 
[01:44:51] <evilgohan2> makes sense as presented, but the problem fundamentally is that people don't trade crypto by faith, they do it by vibes. It's like people learned nothing from the $GME / $AMC thing in early 2021.
[01:45:08] <evilgohan2> Oh, and FOMO. Lots and lots of FOMO.

[18:11:31] <skye0> idk, but I don't want people to toast or boil to death. If governments can be anal with copyright law they're perfectly capable of enforcing strict standards upon nukes
[18:12:34] <NeoThermic> you say that
[18:12:52] <NeoThermic> then go read the incident report for the RCA of what happened in Japan
[18:13:25] <NeoThermic> if they'd listened to the original spec of seawall, then it'd have all been fine. They literally caused the accident by being tightfisted on budget
[18:14:50] <superkuh> Nuclear plants are tight fisted on budget because the safety requirements go up with time so that price of implementation never goes down. It always has to be the $current_best.
[18:16:28] <NeoThermic> yeah, but they literally specced a wall (IIRC) 2M higher than they built, and cut the wall down for budget
[18:20:55] <superkuh> That is pretty straightforward stupid, yes.

[18:32:06] <ThePendulum> pretty much the same story for Chernobyl afaik. even though the designs weren't great, they knew how to build it so the incident wouldn't have happened, but that would've been more expensive, so they just... didn't

[18:42:36] <NeoThermic> ThePendulum, ehh, Chernobyl was a bad design; they knew of the issues but didn't communicate them across
[18:42:57] <NeoThermic> also that accident was a conflict of demands vs procedure
[18:44:34] <NeoThermic> TMI was ironically humans getting in the way of the automated safety stuff
[18:44:46] <NeoThermic> which is why a lot of the newer designs remove humans from the critical safety loop

[18:45:35] <NeoThermic> (TMI was, IIRC a great case of really terrible UI, and I wholly recommend reading up on that aspect if you do any kind of UI work)
[18:46:28] <ThePendulum> if I think of a system designed to keep something safe by overriding human intervention, I also think of MCAS... :P
[18:47:43] <NeoThermic> MCAS was a software solution to a physics problem that was human created
[18:47:52] <NeoThermic> i.e. more cost cutting
[18:48:18] <ThePendulum> that's what I'm saying though, at some point down the line humans are making decisions
[18:48:25] <NeoThermic> TMI was a loss of coolant event, where at one point the humans STOPPED the emergency coolant loop because they didn't know it was a loss of coolant event

[18:48:30] <NeoThermic> ,bang
[18:48:30] <unfinity> NeoThermic you shot a duck in 2.221 seconds! You have killed 370 ducks in #datahoarder.
[18:50:03] <NeoThermic> ThePendulum, MCAS was created because boeing wanted to have the training still be valid; the flight profile of the max was different enough that it'd have required training to use otherwise. It also stemmed from the fact that the larger engines they gave the max were not designed to sit where they do, so they had to add in some way to combat this. Basically it was all about saving money.
[18:50:33] <NeoThermic> (by training to use, I mean they wanted any 737 pilot to be able to take controls of a max without re-training for the differences)
[18:52:26] <NeoThermic> (and there's enough of a distinction between "get this wrong and you just have too much water" vs "get this wrong and you nosedive a plane into the ground" when it comes to removing humans from that loop)

[19:01:23] <ThePendulum> I know what MCAS is for and why it was used, that's why I pointed it out. it's yet another instance where we knew the right thing to do, but decided not to
[19:01:54] <ThePendulum> hence I'm not convinced simply knowing how to design and maintain a safe reactor is going to be enough, we need a way to make sure those plans get executed down to a T too
