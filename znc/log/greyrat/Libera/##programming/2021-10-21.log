[10:55:53] <PlanckWalk> Honestly at this point I'd suspect that they start supporting old win32 apps by bundling wine.
[10:57:43] <deniska> iirc android layer on windows works similarly to wsl2, by launching a "thin" well integrated hyper-v vm
[10:58:08] <mrig> vinegar ~ run all your linux and old windows apps on windows with the all new vinegar from wine interface!
[10:58:13] <deniska> it's not "just an emulator" or even "just a vm", effort was made to well integrate the system
[10:58:55] <mrig> android java to .net java wouldn't be that much difference I wouldn't imagine 
[10:58:57] <arahael> flakland: Android isn't specific to ARM>
[10:59:04] <deniska> android apps display as floating and I assume resizeable windows, if they display a notification, they go to windows notification thingy etc
[10:59:05] <flakland> maybe they trnslate the instructions
[10:59:32] <arahael> Trashlord: Android's linux based in the same way macos is fbsd based.  In practice, there's so many changes and differneces it's probably might as well be considered distinct.
[10:59:34] <deniska> flakland: for android apps the default is to compile them to both arm and x86
[10:59:55] <arahael> flakland: There have been at least a few x86 android phones.
[10:59:59] <deniska> flakland: there were some x86 based tablets and phones for a bit

[12:42:47] <arahael> deniska: And I also want to ensure that it's 'reputable', eg, htere's also AltStore, but that requries I put in my actual account username and password.  Which is a bit suss to me.
[12:42:52] <DnzAtWrk> are tablets still popular?
[12:42:59] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: Yes.
[12:43:01] <DnzAtWrk> I thought people realized that a real computer + smartphone was good enough
[12:43:29] <DnzAtWrk> Tho then again, I've seen tons of children playing with ipads

[12:47:50] <DnzAtWrk> We need smaller VR headsets
[12:48:07] <DnzAtWrk> but you can only make optics that thin
[12:48:40] <DnzAtWrk> the usage of a fresnel lens (those you find in lighthouses) allows you to get a much flatter lens
[12:48:44] <DnzAtWrk> but you get this banding effect

[17:25:24] <wedr> I haven't really touched C# in a long time. I'm wondering if C# allows you to do something similar to Java, where you can just do "new T<>()" and the compiler will automatically determine the generic type for you on instantiation?
[17:25:57] <Teckla> wedr: In Java, that's called the "diamond operator," I believe.
[17:26:17] <wedr> Yeah, the diamond operator. Do we have something equivalent to that in C#?

[17:27:45] <wedr> I don't believe that is it, biberu

[17:28:17] <wedr> Or extending a class as an abstract subclass
[17:29:53] <wedr> Ah, the Java diamond operator equivalent is basically using "var" inferences in C#.    var foo = new T<com.foo.bar.B>()
[17:30:14] <biberu> C# also lets you do T<com.foo.bar.B> foo = new()

[17:31:02] <biberu> List<string> vs = new()
[17:31:29] <wedr> The article you linked to me showed me to put "new()" at the end of the list of class inheritance to keep the class from being an abstract class. Didn't mention about what would happen if it's instantiated.

[18:58:31] <SJrX> Let's say I'm building software for a Window Manager like Windows or macOS, and we have a requirement that all windows should have the same "Look/Feel/Behaviour", you could implement it such that every window just has to manually code up and be responsible for it, or you could architect the system in such a way that common abstractions can be used.

[21:12:01] <ShiftyLogic> WSL?

[21:12:28] <pyzozord> But honestly if I'm 30 and I'm not a senior then I might as well be permanent medior my entire life

[22:29:06] <whatsupdoc> Can someone explain the difference between an API and an interface?
[22:29:29] <wedr> API is Application Programming Interface, which is an interface.
[22:29:57] <whatsupdoc> When I think of interfaces, I think of function scaffolds that you must later implement
[22:30:35] <whatsupdoc> When I think of API, I kind of think of the same thing because the interface is providing an abstraction for interacting with some library (?)
[22:30:46] <Inline> erm
[22:31:22] <pyzozord> whatsupdoc: "interface" is more general, api (aplication programming /interface/) is specifically function you can call
[22:31:30] <pyzozord> s/function/functions
[22:31:34] <Inline> the api is just listing all functions, package internal ones too
