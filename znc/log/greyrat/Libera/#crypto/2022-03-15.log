[10:15:38] <snappy> i've been analysing some IoT devices lately; one used aes-cbc without authentication mode and only looked at the first byte to lock/unlock (it was a smart lock); what's even worse is there is a key exchange mechanism over bluetooth that calls a make_generate_str which uses current time to srand and rand to generate characters that'll be the aes key -- which is fucked, but that's not the fucked
[10:15:39] <snappy> part, when it comes to using the key they use a hardcoded fixed key that was implanted in the binary and the app
[10:15:59] <snappy> and there's no replay protection either
[10:16:02] <snappy> just all sorts of fuckery
[10:16:48] <rqsd> There are a lot more people that require access to someone with cryptography experience than there is supply
[10:18:41] <moose> snappy: it's like most cars
[10:20:07] <snappy> another dodgy thing is, you can reboot the smart lock from the outside (there's a physical button), at which point the device key is set to the all 0 key, you can skip the key exchange dance, and just encrypt commands to unlock the device (but you'll have to figure out the IV which is the device serial number)
[10:20:10] <snappy> it was pretty painful to see
[10:20:47] <moose> many smart door locks have mechanisms to make entry quickly and they are often the same methods

[10:23:56] <moose> super smart
[10:23:57] <moose> lockity lock
[10:31:01] <rqsd> I must admit though -- what protocol *would* you use here
[10:32:26] <rqsd> Like, this clearly feels like it should be a solved problem, I just don't know what paper to look at
[10:32:37] <moose> For what, locks?
[10:32:44] <rqsd> Yeah
[10:33:22] <rqsd> Schnorr identification protocol would probably get me somewhere, but I suspect in the 30 years since its publication, we've found attacks on what would be a naïve implementation thereof (aside from the obvious bignum footguns and power analysis problems)
[10:35:40] <moose> The device, if internet connected, should have a cryptographic key storage chip that is dedicated to storing secrets. Then a salted hash of all eligible passcodes should be stored for comparison on-device and to lookup the profile (user number, whatever) for reporting back to the online service.
[10:35:58] <moose> Any communication between the device and anything else wirelessly should be done over mTLS
[10:36:49] <rqsd> Okay, let's assume a car that isn't a Tesla or has had an owner not pay for the 5G connectivity bill and should unlock anyway.
[10:37:13] <rqsd> Or a door lock for that matter

[10:38:38] <moose> The manufacturer can discontinue support of their locks, once the cert expires it will probably go kaboom if the company is defunct
[10:38:46] <moose> This is the issue, yes?
[10:39:24] <rqsd> Complete disconnection from the Internet is actually higher on my list of worries, but it comes out to a similar problem
[10:39:25] <moose> I think this is solved by design really. An app can stop working, but the locks usually have a code entry face.
[10:41:41] <rqsd> What happens when you run out of passcodes?
[10:43:19] <int-e> . o O ( you should get a list of new ones in the mail before that happens )
[10:44:05] <int-e> Also, the safe failure mode for a lock is to be open, right?
[10:49:22] <moose> int-e: Depends on the requirements by regulatory bodies.
[10:50:22] <moose> Most residences in the US are prohibited from having normally closed locks for example.
[10:50:49] <moose> Electronic locks here will fault and not change position typically. Some do fail to open, but it's illegal for them to fail to closed for residential applications.

[18:00:00] <iz> i remember in college, i was naively trying to find a faster way to factor the product of two primes and i stumbled upon that method and thought i had made a breakthrough and discovered something new
[18:01:07] <iz> and that's when i really realized that if you ever think you discovered something new in math, it's most likely someone already found it years ago when they were like 12 years old or something

[18:13:43] <Alipha> i just used regex to reverse snappy's reversed base64 string. it was the easiest thing that i had available to me. i just performed s/(\S*)(\S) (\S*)/$1 $3$2/ until the string was reversed, heh
