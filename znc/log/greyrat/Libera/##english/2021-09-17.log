[14:52:54] <bullgard4> For non-English native speakers the word "settings" is rather fuzzy. I wonder what "healthcare settings means in https://www.cdc.gov/eis/field-epi-manual/chapters/Healthcare-Settings.html. Is it a compound that people learned in the trade use often as a single entity, or is 'healthcare' only loosely used to further define 'settings'?

[15:13:17] <bullgard4> I have found more hits of "healthcare settings" in WWW than just this one.
[15:13:46] <swarfega> i think its healthcare options. like patients have various options open to them for cancer care for example
[15:16:06] <bullgard4> Ah, I see. -- I just checked if my Firefox browser opens  https://www.cdc.gov/eis/field-epi-manual/chapters/Healthcare-Settings.html yet. --  It does.
[15:16:47] <swarfega> i understand now
[15:16:55] <swarfega> its not setting like computer setting
[15:17:05] <swarfega> its setting like this house is set in lovely open farm land
[15:17:13] <bullgard4> I see. - But rather what?
[15:17:29] <bullgard4> Ok, understood.
[15:18:01] <swarfega> so in a cancer setting such and such treatment would be provided
[15:21:14] <bullgard4> A bit more general: "places where healthcare occurs"?
[15:22:25] <swarfega> setting would still refer to  either the buildings location or certain medical services
[15:23:05] <bullgard4> Ok, thank you for explaining.

[17:46:28] <kurahaupo> I mean, colour does normally vary across an image, but the problem you have is that it varies in the opposite direction from what would be expected, with the blue-grey on both the lateral temples and lower ocular rims, and over-saturated red on the front of the cheeks. I might almost be inclined to desaturate it to greyscale and then shift that to a uniform skin tone; and then mix that back with the original
[17:46:58] <GuiToris> yes, it shone behind me right in the camera. My face was kind of dark so brighten it up

[23:41:08] <GuiToris> blkshp, is Rammstein popular in the UK?
[23:41:19] <GuiToris> this is not the first time you've heard it, is it?
[23:42:07] <blkshp> No, but they sing in a funny language :D
[23:42:13] <blkshp> But no, relatively popular.
[23:43:19] <GuiToris> I recommend listening to 'Amerika', the lyrics is like if you had written it
[23:47:53] <blkshp> are* 
[23:48:13] <blkshp> Also, i think that's the only one I have heard.
[23:48:33] <GuiToris> why am I not surprised? :D
[23:48:46] <blkshp> It's the only one that's actually famous
[23:48:59] <huf> there's a few more
[23:49:20] <pussipupu> Keine Lust is pretty famous
[23:49:23] <huf> they're like the only german band that's known internationally and sings in german
[23:49:25] <pussipupu> and a few others
[23:49:25] <GuiToris> I think you (all) might have said that lyrics was plural, but lyric sounds to be a different word
[23:49:33] <pussipupu> In the circles I'm familiar with at least
[23:49:45] <huf> because scooter might have a funny accent but it's all in english :)

[23:51:24] <huf> oh you mean outside the songs
[23:51:29] <GuiToris> it's kind of non-sense what he talks about in their songs
[23:51:31] <huf> who cares :D that's his private life
[23:51:38] <huf> it makes lots of sense
[23:51:41] <huf> how much is the fish
[23:51:59] <huf> a common question, troubling many minds at any given time
[23:52:37] <huf> stupid words to bündz bündz music is normal anyway :)
