[18:21:32] <jrmu> https://paste.ircnow.org/g92v0tav49u3wxmn8lqf/
[18:22:38] <jrmu> in line 35 if I add srs at the end
[18:22:52] <jrmu> it says: /etc/mail/smtpd.conf:35: an srs key is required for srs to be specified in an action
[18:22:59] <jrmu> how do I pick an appropriate key for srs?
[18:23:09] <jrmu> I tried typing a few random alphanumeric chars and that didn't work

[19:10:15] <rak> jrmu: I just tried it out with 6 random alphanumeric chars and it seems to work
[19:10:53] <rak> mind the syntax though: 'srs key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' goes on a line somewhere before the relevant relay action, and then you tack on 'srs' to the relay action line.
[19:11:29] <jrmu> oh i see!
[19:11:30] <rak> This alternate implementation gives some advice on picking a key: https://github.com/arpa2/srsrelay
[19:11:38] <jrmu> can you give me a sample config rak 
[19:11:48] <jrmu> let me check that
[19:13:19] <rak> srs key 77461d146b2a6201a353fa103a9a4ceb
[19:13:30] <rak> action "relay-rak" relay host smtp+tls://mysecret@myrelayhost auth <secrets> srs
[19:13:36] <jrmu> perfect thank you
[19:13:38] <jrmu> that makes sense

[19:20:37] <jrmu> it worked but did not fix my problem hehe, I will have to investigate more tomorrow
[19:21:07] <jrmu> my current problem is, an email for jrmu@ircnow.org does not get forwarded to jrmu@breadofgod.org: https://paste.ircnow.org/g92v0tav49u3wxmn8lqf/
[19:21:49] <jrmu> because although normally email destined for jrmu@ircnow.org matches line 37, after forwarding it does not match any rule
[19:45:27] <rak> If I understood correctly: after smtpd uses the virtuals table to rewrite jrmu@ircnow.org to jrmu@breadofgod.org in the "lmtp" action, there are no rules that match the expanded recipient?
[19:47:02] <rak> What if you add a rule 'match from local for any action "relay"' after the match for lmtp? I don't use the virtual expansion feature, and its semantics is unspecified in the man page, so I'm just guessing here.
