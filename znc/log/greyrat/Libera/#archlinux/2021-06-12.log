[00:45:05] <diabonas> Foxboron: like grawity basically already said, the TPM libraries only do the secret key operation part, X.509 stuff is usually handled by something else. Like I said, tpm2-tss-engine seems like a good fit if you can use OpenSSL because it takes care of integrating the TPM with a standard crypto library already. As an alternative, you can use your own crypto library and figure out how to outsource the signing and decryption stuff to the
[00:45:05] <diabonas> TPM, but that requires more knowledge of the respective standards and depends on the specific crypto library, making it a bit more involved
[00:45:44] <grawity> the TPM handle? not sure if that's of any use, might as well just use 1 as the serial if you don't care about its uniqueness
[00:45:55] <Foxboron> grawity: hmmmm, yes
[00:46:52] <grawity> (my CA tools just increment from 1, it's supposed to be unique per-issuer and e.g. Firefox will enforce that, but in Secure Boot probably nobody cares)
[00:46:55] <Foxboron> diabonas: I get confused because the tpm can print out the endorsement key certificate, so if I make a new key I thought I could retrieve the cert?

[00:48:53] <grawity> the EK certificate isn't made by the TPM, it's issued by the manufacturer
[00:49:06] <Foxboron> Is that just stored in an nvindex?
[00:49:27] <grawity> yeah, afaik the nvindex just has a flag that means it's permanently locked post-manufacture
[00:50:00] <grawity> ...I'm probably mixing up some tpm1 and tpm2 stuff though
[00:50:11] <diabonas> Foxboron: the EK certificate is a bit of a special case, because you want something that can form a chain of trust, not just a "raw" private key. the rest of the TPM specification basically only deals with the raw crypto operations though, not the higher-level stuff

[01:00:39] <diabonas> grawity: I don't think there are any plans to remove the non-FAPI backend. the complaints about the failed initialisation are a bit of an oversight and should be fixed in the next release, I think. yeah, setting up the FAPI is a bit of a pain if you've already provisioned the TPM on windows - it's not inherently impossible (it could just reuse the primary key that windows already created) and might be fixed in the next release, not sure,
[01:00:39] <diabonas> but at the moment it just errors out without setting everything up. The other direction (provisioning under Linux, reusing the primary key under Windows) worked for me, but you probably don't want to clear your existing TPM just to do that
[01:00:47] *** Joins: danisztl1 (~weechat@user/danisztls)
[01:01:09] <grawity> hmm
[01:01:31] <grawity> probably an option, but I had the impression Windows would try to re-provision it again
[01:02:06] <diabonas> Foxboron: sounds ominous :D come to think of it, using the FAPI might also be an option - I don't think it handles creating the X509 cert for you, but you can at least store a generated cert associated with a key, which might make handling a bit nicer

I can check once I get a hold of that laptop again, currently don't have it with me at the moment unfortunately... but in the end, I definitely had a setup where windows showed "fully provisioned" with the setup from tss2_provision

[01:07:02] <Foxboron> diabonas: the thing which is nive with Go is that it standardizes on crypto interfaces. So the google tpm library implements "crypto.Signer" and I can just pass the library signer and rest of my code just deals with it
[01:07:08] <grawity> diabonas: hmm would be appreciated, if you could find that... I did find a registry key that makes it store the owner password (instead of throwing away) and figured I could use it with tss2_provision somehow

[11:14:12] <jbox> kevr: my girlfriend is insisting that I do a full sweep of my files and organize/back up/prune them, which I think would be easier graphically :)
[11:14:31] <kevr> jbox: Insist that she stop instisting!
[11:14:35] <kevr> It's not her box!
[11:15:00] <kevr> jbox: honestly, it would definitely be easier to do so without a graphical explorer.
[11:15:00] <jbox> Hahaha good point
[11:15:16] <kevr> with a terminal emulator, you get a shell right off the bat. a shell that you can script in.
[11:15:31] <kevr> there are tools available that allow you to recursively inspect files in a directory.
[11:15:59] <kevr> see: `find`, `awk`, `grep`, `ls`
[11:16:12] <jbox> usually I manage by doing it that way, but if I'm going to inspect every file and figure out of it should stay or go, doing so graphically might be my best bet
[11:16:30] <kevr> Should I stay or should I go now?!
[11:16:34] * kevr dances
[11:16:35] <jbox> or maybe something like ranger or nnn, which I usually use

[12:21:21] <h4rd3n3D> Numeral:  a fine and wise choice :D
[12:22:13] <Numeral> Something I love about arch btw is that you can pretty much use a junk USB drive with almost no space to install it
[12:22:28] <h4rd3n3D> yep
[12:23:52] <h4rd3n3D> ofc, the Arch *.iso supports btrfs - but you'll also want to snag `btrfs-progs` at some point
[12:25:45] <Numeral> Is btrfs on lvm on luks a good idea?
[12:26:10] <DevilChaos> i think its just a format
[12:26:17] <Numeral> Yeah
[12:26:24] <DevilChaos> luks should work on it anyway

[12:27:20] <DevilChaos> and how would you get rid of it?
[12:28:12] <Numeral> Actually, I would still need the lvm for my swap. I could put the swap on btrfs as a swap file but that doesn't really appeal to me
[12:29:27] <Numeral> You would get rid of it by unmounting the lvm volumes, getting rid of the volume group, then reformatting the inside of the luks partition

[22:30:47] <Scimmia> I am, too
[22:30:58] <drop> Does anyone know why there could be a delay before my keyboard is usable when I'm prompted for my LUKS passphrase on boot? This only started happening recently and I didn't change anything in mkinitcpio.conf (http://ix.io/3pIp).

[22:34:38] <Scimmia> interesting: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/17756
[22:34:56] <duelle> I just found this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Talk:Systemd-boot#Installation_update_XBOOTLDR  There it says: "Meaning that the Extended Boot Loader partition must be on the same disk as the ESP"

[22:36:02] <duelle> Do you know whether it could work if /boot was located on the first disk (where windows is located) and the rest of the Arch installation on the second
[22:36:11] <Foxboron> duelle: uuUUUuu
[22:36:38] <duelle> Or I need to try to resize the Windows EFI?
[22:36:49] <Foxboron> Sure, that shouldn't matter
[22:37:01] <Foxboron> as in having ESP on a seperate disk
[22:37:31] <Foxboron> But I guess the boot loader specification is imprecise about where the partition needs to be
[22:37:54] *** Quits: ahmubashshir (~ahmubashs@103.133.202.10) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:38:16] <duelle> So the two options I see right now are: 1. Making room on the first (Windows) disk and place the /boot partition there (without messing with the original EFI partition). 2. Extending the size of the EFI partition and keeping /boot where it is. But then just mounting EFI into /boot
[22:38:18] <Scimmia> the systemd gpt auto generator has nothing to do with this, that's far later
[22:38:56] <duelle> Scimmia: I thought that might be used somewhere in the backend

[22:43:10] *** Joins: bitstalker (~bitstalke@user/bitstalker)
[22:43:14] <Foxboron> or hmm, a bit unsure about the dual boot
[22:44:25] <Scimmia> you can also just make the partition you have now into an ESP
[22:44:56] <duelle> You mean the /boot partition? how would UEFI then handle having two of them?
[22:45:03] <Scimmia> Funny that systemd's own spec for XBOOTLDR doesn't require it to be on the same disk
[22:46:05] <Scimmia> as long as you're using NVRAM entries, it's just another partition. You would have to use the firmware's boot manager to choose between linux and windows that way, though

[22:47:33] <duelle> What is implicit?
[22:47:43] <Foxboron> The same disk requirement. The spec is only really talking about "different partitions"
[22:47:49] <duelle> Scimmia: What do you mean with "using NVRAM entries"?
[22:48:01] <Scimmia> duelle: see efibootmgr
[22:49:04] <duelle> Okay, then I'll try to have them separately. That's cleaner anyways. I just thought having two EFIs would lead to issues and I could "easily" reuse the existing one. Well, how wrong I was :P
