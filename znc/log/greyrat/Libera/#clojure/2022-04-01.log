[15:50:29] <sobel> once i was looking at photo blog of things tucked into other things that unexpectedly fit perfectly. things fitted into other things. the concept was oddly satisfying and they called "kentucky" like it the nesting was kentucky if they fit just right
[15:50:51] <sobel> i kept thinking that's almost exactly my software aesthetic
[15:51:34] <Para> Japanese joinery of wood and high-precision milled metal pieces is pretty much safe-for-work porn.
[15:52:07] <sobel> i like that stuff a lot. i usually end up watching lathe turning whenever i watch woodworking tho. youtube is a beast like that.
[15:52:19] <sobel> even if i mean to start with joinery
[15:53:02] <sobel> i grew up around a woodshop (which is no small part of how i ended up in software) and i mean to get more experience

[15:55:38] <sobel> i'm really positive on bringing back control surfaces
[15:55:49] <Para> I can see use for car infotainment systems for a knob like that.

[15:56:28] <sobel> oh yeah, car UIs are a critical balancing act
[15:57:24] <Para> It's got a fancy term I can't remember either, but basically car controls must be usable without looking.
[15:57:52] <sobel> HCI is harder than i ever thought it would be
[15:57:54] <Para> So haptics and physical knobs are quite a good idea. And knob can be mounted on a directional pad as well, eg. 4 or 8 directions so that you can push the whole knob around as well.
[15:58:31] <sobel> my car (honda) has menus that refuse to work when the car is in motion. i don't ever like to see that in a car.
[15:59:38] <sobel> it was more distracting for me to see a refusal for something i didn't even mean to do than it would have been to use the verboten function in motion
[16:00:06] <sobel> oh right there's english for that word too
[16:00:18] <sobel> i did this yesterday too (chatted before caffiene)
[16:00:21] <Para> I drive a Seat Leon and so far my favorite GUI issue is that if someone calls me while I'm driving, the caller's phone number is put on the dash' screen middle section where I usually keep the spedometer.
[16:00:31] <sobel> d'oh!
[16:00:38] <Para> The worst moment I had this happen when I was passing a car on a highway.
[16:00:41] <sobel> you are going CALL RECEIVED km/h
[16:00:59] <Para> +358....km/h, damn this thing is fast!
[16:01:04] <sobel> hehe
[16:01:58] <sobel> the other thing i picked up from Multiplan use at home, was keeping a phone directory in a spreadsheet
[16:02:11] <sobel> you could just edit and print a fresh one to hang by the phone
[16:02:45] <sobel> our phone directory always had one extra unlabeled number at the end. i put in a sum() cell.
[16:03:22] <sobel> you never know when you're gonna need a subtotal of the phone numbers in your dialer
[16:03:34] <sobel> hindsight: never
[16:07:06] <sobel> looks like the smartknob build already needs a BOM change due to parts shortage
[16:07:19] <sobel> smartknob fans bought up the last of a discontinued motor apparently
[16:07:50] <Para> yeah
