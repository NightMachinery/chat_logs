[04:41:55] *** grettke is now known as grettke-away
[04:42:16] <eggbean> emg: I get this, but test2 is a symlink:
[04:42:37] <eggbean> $ ./test.sh
[04:42:39] <eggbean> test2 not a symlink
[04:42:41] <eggbean> One of the files is not a symlink
[04:42:44] <armin> eggbean: https://unix.porn/bloergh.txt
[04:42:58] <armin> eggbean: 100% i overlooked something, but that did the job for me.
[04:43:31] <emg> eggbean: why do you have ~/ in there?
[04:43:58] <emg> and cd into testdir, get a list of files, then cd out of testdir, and try the same file names
[04:44:01] <eggbean> oh I forgot to take that out when making the example
[04:44:02] <emg> I'm getting more confused
[04:44:15] <eggbean> sorry. one minute
[04:45:02] *** Joins: totenkoph (~scythe@user/totenkoph)
[04:45:13] <eggbean> ok, same thing happens with I take the ~/ out
[04:46:16] <eggbean> armin: The reason I made the wrapper in the first place is because exa does not accept -A and I have years of muscle memory typing `ls -Al`
[04:46:58] <eggbean> emg: basically it thinks test2 is not a symlink when it is
[04:47:12] <armin> eggbean: yup exactly, it's just overriding muscle memory for me, too. thankfully it has --group-directories-first and -F, but it failed on some variants of -alrt for me, which i use A LOT.
[04:47:52] <armin> eggbean: so yes, exactly the same problem you had with muscle memory as i had.
[04:48:27] <eggbean> well that script also reverses exa output to match ls
[04:49:34] <armin> eggbean: i read through it, excellent work, even taking into account help from people in here.

[07:43:14] <pandoxer> hi, friends! I have this bash function and binding to quickly search files with fzf and open them on vim. It works fine, but I'm wondering if it's possible to tweak it such that my history entries reflect which file I selected on the fzf filtering. Right now it only displays the name of the function, which is "vimfzf". https://bpa.st/5YUQ

[07:47:18] <pandoxer> ok I wrote too much text
[07:47:44] <pandoxer> tl;dr: how do I expand bash function result in ~/.bash_history?
[07:47:51] <chronon> No, not too much, just it takes people time to decide if they can provide an answer.
[07:48:28] <pandoxer> idk I reread what I wrote and it felt wordy and tiresome
[07:48:30] <twkm> have the function history -d the last entry, then history -s "vim filenames...".
[07:48:50] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[07:49:23] <twkm> the last entry should be the function invocation -- at least i think it will be.
[07:49:55] <pandoxer> hopefully it will hehe

[07:50:20] <pandoxer> seems like a good idea
[07:50:35] <twkm> you can revise your function firstly to just show the last entry, then sleep a little so you have a chance to read that.
[07:51:08] <twkm> then if it is indeed your function+args you can -d it then -s what was run.
[07:51:31] <pandoxer> hmm

[07:55:59] <pandoxer> ok, for some reason adding history -s just before calling vim actually prevents "vimfzf" from being added to the history
[07:56:18] <twkm> wonderful!
[07:56:36] <pandoxer> that was a great solution! thanks, twkm :)
[07:59:51] <pandoxer> what's funny is that it even shows "vimfzf" as being run in the terminal, but pressing arrow-up brings me the actual vim command that was run haha

[12:53:51] <greybot> The difference between $@ and $*: "$@" (quoted) expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ... while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c..." where c is the first character of IFS.

[14:21:51] <pj> !$@
[14:21:51] <greybot> The difference between $@ and $*: "$@" (quoted) expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ... while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c..." where c is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@". The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}" or "${array[*]}". Unquoted $* and $@ are undefined; DO NOT use.

[15:42:19] <eggbean> Is comm a good way to subtract one array from another?
[15:42:34] <ede> as a test i did this: _my_home="/home/\$USER"; eval echo $_my_home
[15:42:43] <ede> but then it's eval
[15:43:05] <earnestly> eggbean: Possibly, but it depends on the input.  Going from an array
[15:43:57] <earnestly> ede: You should probably stop using google to learn bash and just follow the links in the topic.  All you have to do is: my_home=/home/$USER # no need for eval or escaping
[15:44:09] <earnestly> But of course that will expand $USER as its assigned
[15:44:31] <hyper_ch> !eval > ede

[15:46:40] <earnestly> I made that point, but I wonder now
[15:46:53] <earnestly> Doesn't bash have a way to get the home directory of a user without eval?

[20:34:40] <ELFrederich> koollman_, actually I thought it was getting saved but it's not.  It just says the directory at the time I exported HISTTIMEFORMAT, it doesn't get re-evaluated at each command.
[20:35:37] <han-solo> ELFrederich: the histtimeformat is a format string for strftime...as mentioned in the docs, so i don't think it can do what you are asking...
