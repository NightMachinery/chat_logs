[19:21:25] <ramram> no, passively participate in politics, like chetan bhagat once said "Have a view of the politics happening around, but don't get to immersed in it." we can't change the "system" by just building keyboard warriors.
[19:22:35] <bugswriter> you shared an article which require must login, wow
[19:23:44] <ramram> no shit vipul, imagine how much we would have growed if that partition didn't happen. Our cricket teem could won every world cup, imagine the money saved in defense. we could have been superpower, now we are just struggling to name ourselves
[19:23:50] <Hello[m]> Nope I opened without logging in
[19:23:58] <vipul[m]> bugswriter: use js blocker like a noscript extension
[19:24:01] <bugswriter> also what do well educated people do? if you get a change to work in amazon or google in some foreign land you will just leave. most great minds are finding ways to gather data of innocent people so companies can rule over them. Most of people who get education just abandon their origin. 
[19:25:06] <bugswriter> people with education read all consumerism and then end up buying shit from amazon which we don't want. education is support to make us independent but we just end up being slave.
[19:25:08] <vipul[m]> ramram: i dont understand what do you imply here
[19:25:48] <bugswriter> I don't even see any point of education. I think 90% of well educated people are just doing more worse than good. 
[19:25:56] <bugswriter> world was better without those people. 
[19:27:07] <vipul[m]> bugswriter: https://ezup.dev/p/j69we0
[19:31:57] <ramram> they prefer better living condition there. wouldn't you go
[19:34:43] <bugswriter> ofc I go. but I will never be proud of it.
[19:41:07] <ramram> pichai isn't proud he got money. also logic don't see word like "honor,proud" and here is beautiful quote i found
[19:41:10] <ramram> Stand amongst the ashes of a trillion dead souls and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence is your answer 
[19:44:46] <bugswriter> I can't agree with you more. RamRam. now you are talking like a pro. Logic don't see "honor,proud" as I said ofc . I ll go.
[19:45:10] <bugswriter> now it's time to go back to our convo and think. everyone who do bad, isn't this justify all their actions?
[19:45:17] <ramram> your concern and rage is genuine against the "system" but your statements were vague. 
[19:47:30] <bugswriter> I don't think it's vague. people are greedy and the way this system is built, it ask you to be evil. all CEO are bad because if they become good they can't be CEO. 
[19:48:02] <ramram> look no-one really wants to clear this mess. Every year govt appoints 1000 civil servants who ace in their subjects. still there is minimal change on the ground. we as a society are morally corrupt. 
[19:48:34] <bugswriter> with a system where survival ask you to submission your "honor and priciples" and ask you to be corrupt .. you can try doing charity and play nice sometimes to make yourself feel good .. but u can't change the outcome.
[19:49:06] <bugswriter> like look at people who say "WE SHOULD PLANT TREES" they go around try to tell world how important nature is.. bla bla bla. Look at FOSS
[19:49:24] <ramram> how do you move this to negativess holy. i was trying to end this with something hopeful
[19:49:26] <bugswriter> stallman go around tell .. how companies are evil. but if you look closly. in real world. no one gives a shit
[19:49:57] <ramram> we got next luke here guys. 
[19:50:09] <bugswriter> everyday we destroy planet ,, people write more sinister tech and all those GOOD STUFF is just don't matter. 
[19:51:06] <bugswriter> Okay am I wrong? DO you think FOSS or Stallman or people who claims they can make a difference and save nature from green house gas. 
[19:51:09] <bugswriter> really matter? 
[19:51:17] <bugswriter> does anyone give a shit ? 
[19:51:49] <bugswriter> you call me negative and give me hope but ,, we all will run to america if we get a chance. we got no right to talk about Indian Education system to be honest. 
[19:52:13] <ramram> there is a book luke recommended sometimes back "Everything i want to do is illegal" by joel salatin. you should definitely give it a read. 
[19:52:14] <bugswriter> we all know what is the right thing to do , but it's just nobody gives a fuck. 
[19:52:37] <ramram> no we don't know what is the right thing to do, that's the problem 
[19:53:34] <ramram> the conservatives marxist both try to presuade us into believing the right thing they believe in
[19:53:36] <relejek> hey bugs. supp
[19:53:39] <vipul[m]> ramram: lmao
[19:54:12] <bugswriter> idk why we are getting so much references to Luke ? I know that book. 
[19:55:03] <bugswriter> @relejek hey
[19:55:21] <ramram> sorry for referencing someone who you reference in your every other video, but the point is that book clearly dictates the boundaries where the government should limit the rule over citizens.
[19:55:55] <relejek> i like some of luke's content but sometimes his personality irks me.
[19:56:42] <bugswriter> I refrence him in my videos because my channel is similar to his channel. also I only reference him for linux related thing, also why this stupid debate is getting heat? I thought we are men of culture here?
[19:57:11] <ramram> that dude is a white supremacist he won't even spit on our brown asses
[19:58:10] <bugswriter> also to be honest, I also believe in getting a good dictator or facism. people should never be FREE. but I also support Freedom, coz it's important, it's all grey, I can't tell any good way out of this. 
[19:58:14] <relejek> no wrries my guy. lets do our bit. you make good content to raise your audience's intellect and awareness. bugswriter 
[19:58:35] <ramram> there is no heat here g.
[19:58:45] <bugswriter> @ramram idc what he is. I just see him as a linux youtuber and that's it. 
[19:59:31] <ramram> that's the beauty of philosophy. at some point we had some really good dictators in turkey persia and all. 
[19:59:32] *** Quits: aaron (~aaron@59.99.64.33) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:59:57] *** Joins: aaron (~aaron@59.99.64.33)
[20:00:25] <bugswriter> but here is the fact, no dictator can make us a better person. 
[20:00:32] <ramram> i refered to luke just because he recommended the book i never heard before 
[20:01:18] <relejek> guys wut. why you talking about dictators. people power is more practical and more civilized mode of governance .
[20:01:27] <ramram> but he can make a better education system (where this all begin from)
[20:02:02] <relejek> ramram, yes that's what i said. luke's content is good, his philosophy may not suit us(me)
[20:02:51] <ramram> that's the right phrase "his philosophy may not suit us" 
[20:03:05] <bugswriter> can't you see my point. NOTHING CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER EXCEPT US. WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM. Not the companies or government or capitalism. We are the real assholes. We choose to be weak, we choose to be stupid, We don't get guts to do anything. We deserve this. because we did this.
[20:03:53] <bugswriter> most asshole companies are just publically traded. 
[20:03:58] <bugswriter> government is just what we choose
[20:04:29] <bugswriter> or even if we don't choose, we let people oppress us. 
[20:04:29] <relejek> bhai. are you alright? asking sincerely. how are you feeling today?
[20:04:31] <ramram> there are many ways to install python(education system) through ethical people, throught dictators 
[20:05:14] <ramram> that's the price we pay for not participating in politics being governed by our inferiors
[20:07:58] <bugswriter> When I was in that shitty college, A shitty college system. when I paying my whole father's income just to get some bullshit education while getting treated like shit. I literally think, is that the system which is evil? no it's we the people who go into these colleges and get ripped off. because we don't have guts to live without validation they give us. we get afraid to do something without them.
[20:09:13] <bugswriter> so don't blame stupid private colleges for having bad syllabus. you choose to be in that stupid system. and sure you deserve education. it's a right. Well may be in some imaginary perfect world.
[20:10:50] <ramram> it's not a right( constitutionally it sure is article 21(A)  ) but education is a PRIVILAGE.
[20:10:54] <relejek> hmmm bugs and ram. what are we doing now? we were hapless when we were not 'adults' then we had little freedom when we were in college. so, what about now?
[20:12:02] <relejek> we faced 'injustice' or 'unfairness' yet what are we doing to turn that around? 
[20:12:44] <relejek> we didn't had 'good enough' education. what are doing to better educate the people who come after us?
[20:12:50] <ramram> like bugs said we are in a system we bound to do what our predecessor did follow that path and gain the respect easy life or or be a rebel.
[20:13:35] <relejek> what system, man? ig you are in india. then your on a land of the free.
[20:13:52] <relejek> unless you
[20:14:06] <ramram> that should be the point of discussion "what are we doing to better educate the people who come after us" not to just shit ourselves by comforting that our education system is bad
[20:14:26] <bugswriter> who was that guy who said his college had shit syllabus, ask him why he went to such college? why he never just abandoned it? and here it is. oh but I want degree. I need job. bla bla bla. I can't do anything. 
[20:14:29] <ramram> system = educational system
[20:14:34] <relejek> * unless you're still a part of an organization that bounds you to strict rules. you are free to do whatever that is legal.
[20:15:21] <bugswriter> better to educate people? for what ? so they can just end up working for assholes. I think it's better to be an illerate farmer and feed the nation. define better education? it's an education which should liebrate people not make them slaves.
[20:15:24] <ramram> land of the free ? whaaaat bhiya just read what bugs just stated about freedom 
[20:16:01] <bugswriter> better education is a place where people don't look for some stupid companies, it's education where people don't fall for marketing ads and learn choose freely. and do something good. 
[20:16:11] <ramram> bugs we are getting into a loop. why don't you tell about the we going to do next gen?
[20:16:33] <ramram> what should BE THE WAY FORWARD
[20:16:35] <relejek> alright then educate them to work for themselves and be an entrepreneur. to build their own destiny while serving others.
[20:16:43] <ramram> nope relejek
[20:17:02] <bugswriter> better education is when instead of abandoning people and getting into USA, we go to villages and teach kids .. help others. help poor who don't even get a chance to change their fates. 
[20:17:36] <bugswriter> we are living in a nation where more than 50% of population is living worse than 90% dogs in america. 
[20:18:04] <bugswriter> and what we educated youth do? Dream placement - AMAZON
[20:18:18] <vipul[m]> bugswriter: make that 76% instead of 50%
[20:18:22] <relejek> umm most [students] take that route of college education because they don't know what else exists that could provide them better life than grad degree and a job that comes with it.
[20:18:59] <ramram> govt is not going to do unless they are at pressure chance of losing election (which they clearly are not under) or massive pressure from citizens ( which is busy in awakening their castes ) . NGO's we have more than lakh niti aayog published a report saying only 3000-4000 doing real work others are into money laundering
[20:19:06] <relejek> if we think our selves of capable 'engineers' then engineer an alt way to educate people for better opportunities.
[20:20:09] <vipul[m]> i find all this convo pointless and hopeless.
[20:20:27] <relejek> guys just don't compare ourselves with USA. that's not healthy.
[20:20:28] <ramram> that's living condition matter that don't matter before education once the education get's into steam everything will rolling out economic opportunities jobs GDP
[20:20:45] <Vaibhav[m]> vipul[m]: +
[20:21:08] <bugswriter> @ramram there is not way forward. people don't change like this. you can't just tell people to be good and they become good. forget others' I can't be good. its' hard for everyone to do something moral. because look at us. Every family have guy who work his whole life and die in debt. we are too weak to think about others. it's a survival game. 
[20:21:28] <ramram> the question is how do we get the better education system in our nation. they rolled a new education policy 
[20:21:39] <ramram> has many flaws but still a great step 
[20:22:06] <relejek> ram let's stop thinking at national level. start with your locality.
[20:22:13] <ramram> beautiful that is the reality
[20:22:14] <relejek> start with your friend circle
[20:22:21] <bugswriter> you can just show things are getting better and lets do something good in education by tweaking this and that. but no. how can you make engineering better in a country where 99% engineers are just money whores. who choose stream just for money. 
[20:22:22] <ramram> sure 
[20:22:47] <ramram> that is a big problem
[20:22:48] <bugswriter> @relejek don't even think to start with friend circle. you will end up losing friends. mark my worlds. 
[20:22:48] *** Quits: aaron (~aaron@59.99.64.33) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:23:01] *** Joins: aaron (~aaron@59.99.64.33)
[20:23:15] <relejek> no fam. not everyone chooses their stream for money.
[20:23:18] <bugswriter> Also I don't believe is saying when the other guy have no intention to hear. 
[20:23:23] <ramram> just begin with educating people about ethics, virtues 
[20:23:34] <ramram> that's what ancient greeks and romans did, 
[20:23:50] <relejek> bugs too late bro. i have already started working on that.
[20:23:51] <Tor[m]> relejek: I know many computer engineering majors ( first years ) who hadn't heard of linux 
[20:23:54] <bugswriter> @ramram i can't example this but. if you try this you will fail. look at stallman he do this. 90% just ignore. 
[20:23:58] <ramram> they have to hear look how they hear about temples mosques
[20:24:11] <ramram> if you allow i have a wonderful story about this
[20:24:18] <relejek> we have a learning group where we 'educate' each other on diffrent topics and streams 
[20:24:28] <ramram> this will blow your mind type story
[20:24:28] <bugswriter> we the people are the problem. we are driven by greed. your teacher sucks at teaching because they are driven by greed. student suck at getting talented because they driven by greed.
[20:24:41] <bugswriter> money control us and take our freedom away. 
[20:25:03] <ramram> that can only be treated with good virtues morals geeta
[20:25:08] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: Capitalism's side effect
[20:25:22] <relejek> ^ what Tor[m] siad.
[20:25:29] <ramram> you are again telling the problem we all know we are morrally corrupt people on earth 
[20:25:37] <Tor[m]> ramram: Morals are only good when one can benefit from them
[20:25:57] <ramram> heyyyyyyy bhiya that's the purpose of morals
[20:26:07] <ramram> that's what they are for
[20:26:59] <Tor[m]> Financially
[20:27:30] <bugswriter> capitalism's side effect?? it's our vurnerability, WE had a flaw and capitalist just exploit it.
[20:27:42] <relejek> bugs my guy. 'money does not control us' it may influence us, some more, some less.
[20:27:50] <bugswriter> don't blame capitalism , I think capitalist are geniues. I respect smart people. we let them exploit us. 
[20:28:05] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: Well exploitation is the strong hand of capitalism 
[20:28:08] <bugswriter> its exactly like .. when we get some telegram scammer in our group. we kick them out but in real world we end up getting exploited.
[20:28:09] <ramram> okay anyway, in switzerland caught the money laundring racket. they siezed the money and asked the citizens what to do with it. they said USE IT IN PUBLIC WELFARE. the people said to use it in public welfare. the govt earlier proposed to give every citizen some percentage of total
[20:28:53] <Tor[m]> ramram: USA used it in surveillance programs and other intelligence so does India
[20:29:17] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: It's not a blame game 
[20:29:24] <Tor[m]> But it's a reality
[20:29:25] <ramram> like similarily govt proposes here to give money in bank accounts
[20:29:53] <Tor[m]> ramram: Free money is not the right answer
[20:29:53] <bugswriter> look at Burger King, We go to burger king, first they manupilate us into goning to that place via ads, then we pay 250 for a 50 rupee burger, and what is a burger a diabatic fast food which is addictive so more manupilation and it's not even good. I felt like getting scammed. But still all we need enough people and things get legitimate.
[20:30:31] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: I don't eat at big fast food chains 
[20:30:35] <Tor[m]> Vocal for local
[20:30:38] <Tor[m]> XD
[20:30:47] <relejek> look every economical philosophy has a dark underside, however colorful it may apear from above. capitalism has exploitation and communism has corruption.
[20:31:24] <ramram> yeah corruption look how corrupt china is
[20:31:28] <vipul[m]> the root cause to this is the humans themselves. kill em all....
[20:31:40] <relejek> lmao
[20:31:44] <Tor[m]> I wasn't shilling for communism
[20:31:47] <ramram> that is authoritarinism
[20:31:57] <Tor[m]> Everything has the flaws
[20:32:00] <ramram> btw china is more fascist than communist
[20:32:14] <relejek> i mean fear and incentives is basic human manipulation irrespective of econ phil.
[20:32:31] <bugswriter> again that thing, capitalism consumerism. guys can't you get it. it's WE
[20:32:40] <bugswriter> we are the problem. not the poor who is not smart enough
[20:32:47] <bugswriter> to do anything but we the middle class
[20:32:53] <bugswriter> who get a chance to see through the smoke 
[20:32:58] <bugswriter> and do nothing
[20:33:05] <relejek> yes bugs it we and we will be the only ones to bring change however small it is.
[20:33:06] <Tor[m]> We leave
[20:33:23] <Tor[m]> We don't do our part
[20:33:27] <bugswriter> it's not shitty education system. it's we who let these private colleges take charge of education.
[20:33:32] <relejek> i have some influence over my locality. i work on improving their lives by education and awarness.
[20:33:33] <bugswriter> we pay them we took admission we 
[20:33:42] <bugswriter> become fuel the system .
[20:33:56] <ramram> and how do WE fight the private college @bugswriter
[20:34:14] <ramram> what's the solution bugss
[20:34:15] <relejek> i don't bother with what i can't control just make sure it the biger stuff doesn't affect me negatively.
[20:34:22] <bugswriter> @relejek do it. but here is the fact. you will end up , making no difference and getting sadder and sadder. 
[20:34:34] <bugswriter> @ramram WE CAN'T CHANGE PEOPLE. 
[20:34:35] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: Letting it go 
[20:34:40] <Tor[m]> Is the best idea
[20:34:44] <bugswriter> WE GOT EXPLOITED ,, BADLY
[20:34:48] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: But we can change ourselves
[20:34:52] <ramram> hey relejek do it. he's just pessimist
[20:35:01] <vipul[m]> bugswriter: but can kill em....
[20:35:02] <bugswriter> it's a HACK which exploited our Vurnerability bigger than LOG4J 
[20:35:04] <ramram> please do it see the change
[20:35:26] <bugswriter> we are too powerless to do something and to get power we need to climb the stupid system but system will make us EVIL so fuck priciples and even if we get on top
[20:35:27] <Tor[m]> > <@telegram_646588922:t2bot.io> > <@bugswriter:libera.chat> @ramram WE CAN'T CHANGE PEOPLE.
[20:35:27] <Tor[m]> > 
[20:35:27] <Tor[m]> > but can kill em....
[20:35:27] <Tor[m]> Everyone is going to die one day
[20:35:34] <bugswriter> in order to survive on top we have to be continously EVIL
[20:35:40] <ramram> nooooo letting it go is not the bestttttt what do you eat broo
[20:35:43] <vipul[m]> Tor[m]: ofcourse the faster the better.
[20:35:49] <bugswriter> some people try to be good  but it's so rare they end up making no difference. 
[20:35:51] <ramram> it's not best it's not even good for a hermit
[20:36:30] <relejek> bugs i see the people smiling and with hope in their eyes when they can do math and understand how much bank balance their account has. [adult literacy] i don't feel sad, i feel fulfilled.
[20:36:43] <bugswriter> @Tor[m] if that's what we have to do .. Kill people than start with ourselves is my best Idea. 
[20:36:47] <ramram> relejek where are you heading bro
[20:37:04] <relejek> when i see my ludite friend use linux ( ubuntu usually) i feel that they are in safe hands.
[20:37:08] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: Death isn't the answe tbh
[20:37:10] <ramram> this bugswriter will turn into a rampage
[20:37:44] <bugswriter> @relejek sure we can laugh have fun. we can watch tik toks or have some actual relationships, but still the truth is truth. facts don't change.
[20:37:54] <ramram> ofcourse it's not the answer 
[20:38:13] <bugswriter> you can't expect poor middle class .. who literally just give his whole life up, to be some moralistic. 
[20:38:31] <ramram> i feel like crying why bugswriter is talking about tik tok

[20:39:34] <bugswriter> we all can blame others all the time instead of blaming us. 
[20:39:38] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: We are 
[20:39:40] <bugswriter> by us I mean .. ourselves
[20:39:50] <ramram> that's what you were trying to say from the beginning ?
[20:40:24] <bugswriter> no capitalist is doing bad job. .. here is a quote by tyler wellick. POWER BELONG TO THOSE WHO TAKE IT, IT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SKILLS OR TALENT. capitalist take power. because we let them. 
[20:40:27] <bugswriter> that's just it
[20:40:28] <ramram> go on bugswriter you got a new follower TOR. make a cult
[20:40:31] <NeoVoid[m]> Aryan[m]: tried using vp?n

[20:40:45] <Aryan[m]> Any suggestions for free VPN🥲?
[20:40:46] <relejek> from dust to dust. don't worry bugs. in the face of death nothing matters. just do your part fam. bring a smile in other's life however small it is. who knows they'll share stories of your deed to their grandchildren and you get to live one extra decade.
[20:41:02] <ramram> tyler wellick is a fictional character
[20:41:10] <NeoVoid[m]> omg you guyz are still having the same discussion on that topic?
[20:41:27] <vipul[m]> btw the universe will die in 100 trillion years already so no point in doing anything.
[20:41:42] <Tor[m]> vipul[m]: Nah more
