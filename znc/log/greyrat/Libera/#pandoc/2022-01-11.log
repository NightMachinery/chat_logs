[04:30:57] <etothepii> Hi there - is this the right place to ask a question about pandoc readers? I'm struggling with get a custom reader working that can parse [h1]header[/h1] style headers.
[04:35:51] <Xenguy> etothepii, It is I think, but I confess I rarely see many answers
[04:36:20] <Xenguy> Can't hurt to try I suppose
[04:37:22] <etothepii> Being in the right place is at least a plus.
[04:39:17] <etothepii> Here's the current input filter - it's the default sample, just with added handlers for [i] and [b] and [h#]

[04:39:51] <etothepii> But I can't seem to figure out how to get the header working - looking at the AST, it looks like it's parsing it as a paragraph rather than a head block, but I'm not sure why.

[07:43:39] <etothepii> OK - well, after some fighting, I have something working, but it feels a bit inelegant. I ended up posting the lua on stack overflow to ask if there was a simpler mechanism for handling start/end tags, but if anyone stumbles on this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70661539/opening-and-closing-elements-in-lpeg-for-pandoc-reader
