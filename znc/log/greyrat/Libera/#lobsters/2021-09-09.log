[00:01:05] <cferry> well, when you create multiple companies, you are also creating a 'know-how' within a country. If you fail multiple times, but still have talent, you'll success eventually. That's wealth and stays in the country
[00:01:14] <cferry> you didn't have a Google or FB overnight, many failed before
[00:01:21] <cferry> they're in that stage, and that's great. Many countries are not even trying
[00:02:23] <drobilla> In a sense perhaps, but tech workers are about the most potentially nomadic workers there are, so it might not stay in the country...
[00:03:01] <cferry> that's true. They're working around increasing wages too, hope that helps
[00:03:04] <cferry> but it is a good point
[00:03:06] <drobilla> A lot of that talent will probably be imported to begin with

[20:41:03] <mockturtle> Announcing Rust 1.55.0 [release rust] (saffaffi) https://lobste.rs/s/kn08hu

[20:41:38] <belak> I saw that Rust announcement... am I missing something? It seems fairly underwhelming compared to previous releases.
[20:42:01] <manicennui> Must every release blow you away?
[20:42:18] <belak> No, I guess that's a fair point

[20:42:48] <kline> rustc 1.56.0-nightly (ad02dc46b 2021-08-26)
[20:42:49] <indigo> Release announcements are pretty low signal to me
[20:42:59] <kline> imagine celebrating 1.55 when you can already 1.56 and 57
[20:42:59] <indigo> Thankfully you can filter out the release tag :-)
[20:43:07] <manicennui> indigo: Unless they specifically fix a problem you were having.
[20:43:32] <manicennui> Oh, you mean generally.
[20:44:24] <belak> I guess rust releases are pretty frequent - I didn't realize they were every 6 weeks. I'm more used to Go releases which tend to have a fairly large or important change in most releases... but they're 6 months apart.
