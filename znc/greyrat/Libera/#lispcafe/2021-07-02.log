[04:46:23] <gilberth> Hmm, would it be safe to expand a macro twice?
[04:47:16] <hayley> IIRC CL allows it in some contexts, like in function bodies.
[04:49:57] <gilberth> Well, I face a snippet of code and would like to know, whether a certain symbol is used as a symbol macro. In theory I could just look at the s-expr, if it appears lexically [which would be suffice]. In practice SBCL has this very funny idea of backquote and as I learned recently a structure object would appear in the code.
[04:51:03] <gilberth> Hence, I would need to fully macro-expand the snippet and then look. I could either just macro expand and pass the original as my expansion, or pass the already expanded macro. I guess the former would be more save.
[04:52:32] <gilberth> This is relevant to my scanner generator. In a rule like (:foo -> "(abc)?xyz" ...action...), I would like to know, if \1 is referred to at all. If not, I could spare having tags for the first submatch.
[04:53:59] <gilberth> However, a full code walker is not trivial, because it must keep a proper environment, so that it knows, whether a symbol refers to a macro, or is shadowed by a LET, or LABELS e.g.
[04:54:01] <hayley> agnostic-lizard?
[04:54:25] <gilberth> Hmm? What do you want to tell me?
[04:54:59] <hayley> That is a code walker library which I think can tell you about uses.
[04:55:23] <hayley> (IMO () making a match by default and then having to use (?:) to not match is a design flaw.)
[04:56:15] <gilberth> Ok. I suffer from NIH syndrome. Too many, too bad libs out there.
[04:57:28] <gilberth> hayley: Indeed. And I would prefer submatches being named. In my SRE syntax they are. But user might prefer to stick to POSIX or lex(1) syntax.
[04:59:30] <gilberth> A pure look at the unexpanded s-expr would be suffice, but nasty SBCL. My relationship to SBCL isn't getting any better. :(
[05:01:20] <gilberth> To answer my question: I was wondering if (macroexpand (fully-macroexpand x)) is safe. It probably is.
[05:02:16] <hayley> Well, FULLY-MACROEXPAND hits a fixed point, right?
[05:02:58] <gilberth> hayley: I can't use agnostic-lizard. Wrong license.
[05:04:28] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, it would. However: When I come across a MACROLET, say, how to craft the new environment in a portable way? Hmm.
[05:09:46] <gilberth> I perhaps could use trivial-macroexpand-all. Yep, should give it a try.

[05:24:03] <gilberth> White_Flame: That doesn't solve anything. I need to fully macro expand.
[05:24:23] <White_Flame> well, it's an example of expanding macrolets as well
[05:24:45] <White_Flame> although "from the inside", and portable
[05:29:24] <gilberth> White_Flame: How would you get a fully macro expanded form?
[05:30:07] <gilberth> macroexpand-dammit fails on (LET ((X :SPECIAL)) (DECLARE (SPECIAL X)) (SYMBOL-MACROLET ((X :X-FROM-MACRO)) (LOCALLY (DECLARE (SPECIAL X)) X)))
[05:30:31] <gilberth> It expands the innermost X as the symbol macro, which is wrong, as it is locally declared special.
[05:31:31] <gilberth> So much for my NIH syndrome.
[05:32:29] * hayley still is unsure why the load order breaks things.
[05:32:53] <gilberth> I mean: When I would walk a MACROLET, I must craft a new lexical environment, which contains that definition.
[05:34:50] <gilberth> An environment which is understood by CL:MACROEXPAND, or CL:MACRO-FUNCTION.

He had such a knowledge of virtual machines that he could even keep the ones he cared about from using C. The dark side of the virtual machine is a pathway to many abilities
[17:51:02] <hayley> some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his portability, which eventually, of course, he did.

[19:25:01] <shka> selwyn: you know what would be cool?
[19:25:48] <shka> if starship would attempt bringing Hubble space telescope to earth 
[19:26:05] <shka> to place this venerable machine in the museum

[20:35:30] <ck_> I personally prefer to look at light that's much more fresh
[20:36:19] <ck_> like the array of shiny dots through which we communicate. tiny stars if you will. such poetic ...  wow
