[00:53:28] <b0nn> So I was shown a "remote pair programming" tool yesterday https://tuple.app/linux-alpha
[00:53:48] <b0nn> Oh, sorry, that's the "notify me if you ever make the linux version"
[00:54:30] <b0nn> So, I'm trying to figure out - if you have multiple viewers of the same file editing at the same time - isn't that going to confuse the hang out of the editor?
[00:54:57] <b0nn> am presuming people here have dealt with concurrent file writing before
[00:56:03] <b0nn> Is it - one file, one editor, and two people looking at it at once, or, one file with muiltiple concurrent editors
[00:56:17] <b0nn> Because I believe VSCode can do that

[05:39:41] <snappy> yeah, i think i found my answer in the language reference too
[05:39:45] <snappy> If one or more of the communications can proceed, a single one that can proceed is chosen via a uniform pseudo-random selection. Otherwise, if there is a default case, that case is chosen. If there is no default case, the "select" statement blocks until at least one of the communications can proceed.

[09:56:48] <seebs> It means whenever a read from it succeeds, which can happen either if a message is sent to it, or it's closed. But as it happens, the only thing that ever happens legitimately with a context's Done channel is that it gets closed.
[09:57:31] <bpalmer> at least by convention.
[09:59:11] <iateadonut> thanks so much for the very clear explanation.
[10:00:51] <seebs> I am pretty sure that if you close the Done() channel of a context, you're breaking a rule. Come to think of it, I'm not sure you can. Done() returns a read-only channel, and I don't think you can close those?
[10:01:07] <seebs> So I think it's actually impossible if you don't have access to the internals of the Context, and I think you don't.
[10:03:38] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[10:06:19] <iateadonut> context.Done() returns a channel, which is closed when context.CancelFunc() is called
[10:07:00] <iateadonut> are there any esoteric uses of context, or is it generally just used for http requests?
[10:09:02] <bpalmer> any potentially long-running tasks. Definitely common in all RPCs, though.
[10:09:35] <bpalmer> I regularly use contexts when I spawn off a background goroutine.
[10:10:02] <bpalmer> iateadonut: note that Done() will also be closed when deadlines or timeouts are hit.

[11:47:37] <eyJhb> ikke: also, it just ... doesn't seperate the words right... ie. `foo;bar` `foo,bar`. With `;` they seem more "glued" together

[18:37:32] <michelem> Hello folks. I'm writing a gRPC application and built a connect() function to simplify boilerplate. However, I notice that it doesn't save me all that much, as I still need to handle the connect() error, AND to create a context in the calling function (so I can cancel it upon its termination).
[18:38:02] <michelem> I was wondering if there are other ways to simplify that. Perhaps callbacks? Let me know if I need to share code for example.

[18:43:24] <bpalmer> sadly, dealing with errors complicates the ability to use helper functions, because usually you still have to propagate errors upward.
[18:44:03] <bpalmer> technically , you could carefully use panic() because it can cross function boundaries, but that's something to be very wary of doing.
[18:44:48] <bpalmer> in the end, go encourages some amount of boiler plate ; a 3 line 'if err != nil { return err }'  shouldn't be that big a deal.
[18:47:25] <michelem> How about simulating python's ContextManagers by embedding all boilerplate into connect(), letting this function handle all of its possible errors, and passing the computation logic as a closure when connect() succeeds?
[18:48:38] <bpalmer> that's doable, although it feels like you're inventing promises here.

[18:50:50] <bpalmer> Effectively, this is just a fancyConnect().then(func() { ... }).then(func() { ... }).on_error(func() { ... }).execute()
[18:52:21] <bpalmer> It depends how much boiler plate there is; again,  if it's just a matter of the three line if/err check, I wouldn't bother; if there's a lot of complicated boiler plate, I might
[18:52:54] <bpalmer> but possibly the error handling could be factored out, so that it comes back to 'if err != nil { return handleConnectError(err); }'

[19:02:51] <bpalmer> it should work, although it will complicate how you deal with errors in the body function.
[19:03:07] <michelem> gRPC's connection boilerplate is some 15 lines. I don't see a benefit in RY, especially for so much code. If I need to change a connection flag, I'd need to do so all over the place
[19:03:13] <bpalmer> Play around with it if you'd like; I just don't think it will gain you all that much.
[19:03:21] <michelem> ok. I'll give it a try; thanks.

[19:09:53] <michelem> looking at the practicalities â€“Â I see an easy way to emulate that by passing 2x closures (callback and errback), twisted-style. How would I reproduce the connect().then().else() instead? I need to declare an interface Promise, then a structure, then implement the functions and return it â€“ right?
[19:10:28] <michelem> perhaps syntactically appealing, but a lot of code for that.
[19:14:38] <bpalmer> you don't need to, I was just showing the .then() to be explicit about the structure
[19:15:17] <bpalmer> you can't use else as a function name (although Else would work, and you probably want these to be exported, anyway)

[19:18:36] <bpalmer> but yeah, something like struct Connecter { thens []func() error; elses []func(e error) ; err error }  func (c *Connector) Then(f func()) { c.thens = append(c.thens, f) }  ... func (c *Connector) Execute() { setup(); i := 0 ; for c.err != nil && i < len(c.thens) { c.err = c.thens[i](); i++ } }
[19:18:38] <bpalmer> and so on.
[19:20:13] <bpalmer> passing data from one then to the next is complicated, so there may not be a benefit in supporting multiple thens
[19:20:38] <bpalmer> so your original func(func() err, func(e err))  may be the better way.
