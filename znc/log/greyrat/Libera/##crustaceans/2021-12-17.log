[00:45:00] <dimadima> i have one repo
[00:45:33] <dimadima> I wonder how many LOCs I have
[00:46:07] <manicennui> 10k LOC in one method: run_application()

[00:46:26] <dimadima> nice application

[02:02:47] <buttsbot> Twitter - TinkerSec - Alright, I'm officially over #Log4J.  Not saying anything in my org is patched.  Just saying I'm done worrying about it &amp;...
[02:04:38] <dimadima> lol
[02:05:05] <dimadima> A+++
[02:05:16] <dimadima> I did my own research
[02:06:17] <dimadima> lol it's a whole thread!
[02:06:25] <Brekkjern> Oh, yes. And it's great :P
[02:06:34] <Brekkjern> >Those systems were End of Life and had so many preexisting vulnerabilities.
[02:06:34] <Brekkjern> >They're just being attributed to #Log4Shell to run up the numbers!
[02:24:58] <ngoldbaum> lol i just had to write some python code to prove that my lawyer made a math error in a legal document
[02:25:22] <ngoldbaum> i guess i could have used an excel spreadsheet to speak native business math
[02:28:53] <dimadima> covid's over
[02:29:08] <dimadima> i've moved on
[02:29:19] <dimadima> it's everyone's personal responsibility now
[02:40:17] <manicennui> I seem to be hearing about more people getting it now.
[02:42:37] <indigo> ngoldbaum: gotta love Python for small code like that
[02:43:10] <indigo> Solving AoC problems with NumPy is the best
[02:43:32] <ngoldbaum> there’s a decent number that are way way easier with array math
[02:44:11] <dimadima> manicennui: me too
[02:44:31] <dimadima> hopefully omicron will be weak and that'll be that
[02:45:08] <manicennui> I think the current thinking is that it doesn't cause severe symptoms most of the time, but it is pretty infectious.
[02:45:58] <prussian> Man. Today I just watched my mentee get fired over MS Teams.
[02:46:05] <prussian> Well laid off... not fired.
[02:46:30] <manicennui> Were they singled out or was it part of a mass layoff?
[02:47:55] <prussian> I'm guessing 6. 2 in our group. But the HR and the Director had 6 shared 30 minute blocks on their calendar
[02:48:25] <prussian> He was singled out probably because he told his boss things like how he has no tasks and no one seems to mind.
[02:48:35] <prussian> Probably shouldn't tell your boss you basically don't matter.
[02:48:39] <prussian> Oh well.
[02:48:48] <prussian> Whack though. Lot of buttmad.
[02:48:51] <manicennui> Isn't that kind of a failing of the boss?
[02:49:16] <prussian> Yes
[02:49:25] <prussian> But that's MO here.
[02:49:31] <ngoldbaum> seems shitty
[02:49:43] <prussian> Ya. I didn't know what to say.
[02:49:50] <prussian> It is his first job.
[02:50:08] <prussian> I'm moving on soon myself.
[02:50:11] <ngoldbaum> he learned a valuable lesson to be a toady
[02:50:18] <ngoldbaum> yeah seems like a shit place
[02:50:33] <manicennui> Fortunately my current employer has never had layoffs while I've worked there. We froze hiring for about a year during the pandemic, but that's it.
[02:50:50] <manicennui> We'll see what happens if we miss quarterly numbers a few times.
[02:50:52] <prussian> Like I told him, "from my own experience, management will basically use anything they know to fuck you over."
[02:51:06] <prussian> Not that that is right. But it's just how it seems to work out
[02:51:14] <prussian> I never tell my boss really anything.
[02:51:41] <prussian> Ya
[02:51:54] <prussian> Our company has traded hands. We don't make big money.
[02:52:12] <prussian> And it sounds like they want to reorg all the like-technology groups under the same new organization
[02:52:34] <manicennui> My last job was like that, but it was our product that wasn't doing well. UHG always does well.
[02:52:46] <manicennui> But UHG also does layoffs and hiring freezes frequently.
[02:52:57] <prussian> MERRY CHRISTMAS
[02:53:00] <manicennui> Layoff at the beginning of the year, then hiring freeze at the end.
[02:53:06] <prussian> Ya
[02:53:32] <manicennui> They were mostly pretty good about laying off the right people.
[02:53:44] <manicennui> But sometimes it would just be random areas they thought we could do without for a bit.
[02:54:03] <prussian> I mean ya. My mentee wasn't exactly the productive center of excellence. He was an easy target.
[02:54:08] <prussian> And ya
[02:54:48] <manicennui> I'm in a good spot now. I don't really care whether I remain employed, and my employer sees me as someone they need to retain.
[02:55:12] <manicennui> Having enough savings and few responsibilities is so nice.
[02:57:25] <manicennui> No spouse, no kids, no cars, housing costs are well below what I could afford.
[02:57:49] <prussian> This
[02:57:55] <prussian> Bachelor life forever
[02:58:15] <prussian> Anyhow. Bad day. Merry Christmas I guess.
[02:58:27] <manicennui> I wonder whether gay couples have it easier in this regard.
[02:58:46] <manicennui> They could adopt, but many don't.
[02:59:14] <manicennui> Not even sure whether they an in all of the US.
[02:59:18] <manicennui> they can
[03:00:44] <prussian> Idk man lol
[03:03:30] <dimadima> i've got to learn german

[03:04:51] <manicennui> Whatever update Windows installed tried to get me to enable some of the bullshit I specifically chose not to enable.
[03:04:56] <Brekkjern> I remember pretty much fuck all from German class, except for that and one more quote :P

[05:33:04] <drakonis> l o l rails 7 out
[05:33:12] <drakonis> its still bad
[05:49:59] <cb> rip peter
[06:04:05] <dimadima> why is rails bad
[06:05:20] <dimadima> Vintage Story is powered by our own cross-platform game engine. This allows us to tailor the engine exactly to our needs while still keeping hardware requirements low. We are 100% Indie.
[06:05:31] <dimadima> hmm
[06:06:54] <drakonis> dimadima: the philosophy where everything you do is boxed inside the rails way and rails interferes with you whenever you try to do anything
[06:07:10] <drakonis> rails renames classes and functions with inflections
[06:07:26] <drakonis> this has repeatedly caused me headaches because there's no way to disable it
[06:08:04] <drakonis> plus rails gives no fucks about the existence of languages besides english
[06:08:10] <drakonis> and even that, is poorly supported
[06:11:54] <dimadima> yeah interesting stuff w/ the inflections
[06:12:30] <dimadima> i've never used rails but that whole thing seemed to be big 2005-2015
[06:12:35] <dimadima> cakephp had that, for example
[06:12:54] <dimadima> very strange to take "convention over configuration" so hard in that direction
[06:13:26] <dimadima> hmm rails is not very flexible
[06:14:07] <dimadima> lame
[06:14:25] <dimadima> i could never really wrap my head around "progressive enhancement"
[06:14:54] <dimadima> rendering HTML w/ a backend, then pickiing that up on the frontend and then possibly doing more round trips to the backend
[06:14:58] <dimadima> that is very complicated for me

[08:11:19] <dimadima> does that effect have a name i wonder
[08:11:22] <dimadima> the passing of time
[08:11:24] <manicennui> I think it might have helped me understand something about my thinking.
[08:11:54] <manicennui> Might be a stretch, but the way logic is described as a hinderance to ideas is a bit like how I feel about static typing.
[08:13:05] <dimadima> The mathematician Darboux claimed he was un intuitif (an intuitive)
[08:13:49] <dimadima> very cool section
[08:14:01] <dimadima> never read about Poincaré
[08:14:23] <manicennui> Same.
[08:14:48] <manicennui> I find mathematics interesting generally, but I've never studied it much beyond the K-12 courses I took.
[08:14:53] <dimadima> His mathematics teacher described him as a "monster of mathematics"
[08:15:23] <dimadima> i had privilege to peek at pure math in college and it was awesome
[08:15:41] <manicennui> I find graph theory really intriguing.
[08:15:55] <dimadima> never looked at that
[08:16:23] <dimadima> i mean, beyond nothing interesting
[08:16:29] <manicennui> And discrete mathematics, which I believe is common CS curriculum.
[08:16:46] <dimadima> proof-based analysis was really interesting
[08:17:03] <dimadima> starting with, like, defining the various numbers
[08:17:17] <dimadima> and then proving things like the square root of 2 is irrational
[08:17:37] <dimadima> i read a bit of this a while back and it blew my mind https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_Gem
[08:17:38] <buttsbot> Euler's Gem - Wikipedia
[08:18:05] <manicennui> I don't even understand the first sentence of that article.
[08:18:35] <dimadima> the book is much more approachable
[08:18:53] <dimadima> his discovery in the early 1750s that the Euler characteristic V − E + F {\displaystyle V-E+F} {\displaystyle V-E+F} is equal to two for all convex polyhedra
[08:19:25] <dimadima> for a given polygon, the sum of the number of vertices, -edges, and faces is equal to 2
[08:19:41] <dimadima> pick a convex polyhedron, and that is true
[08:20:06] <manicennui> Topology is kind of a mind blowing concept to me.
[08:20:11] <dimadima> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic#Polyhedra
[08:20:11] <buttsbot> Euler characteristic - Wikipedia
[08:20:12] <manicennui> That we can actually calculate such things.
[08:20:48] <dimadima> in a cube you have 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces; V − E + F = 2
[08:20:59] <dimadima> ridiculous no one noticed that until 1750
[08:21:24] <dimadima> and it took not just anyone to notice that, but leonard euler
[08:22:04] <dimadima> and then people just ran with it and abstracted it to shit
[08:22:05] <manicennui> Fucking noobs.
[08:22:36] <manicennui> I wonder which mathematicians in history did the most shit talking.
[08:22:48] <dimadima> liebnitz
[08:23:08] <dimadima> i really killed leibniz
[08:23:15] <dimadima> leibniz
[08:24:20] <dimadima> good cookies too

[08:53:21] <manicennui> It's interesting to me to contrast that first thread with the thread I'm in now where everyone is all about the 20th century factory worker mentality.
[08:53:48] <manicennui> "Create a doc/Jira for the project, including timelines and tasks. Allocate tasks to all teammates. Daily/weekly go through those tasks, updating progress. If timelines are being held back by someone, I'm going to make management aware because I'm not taking the fall. If they're not then I don't care."
[08:56:56] <dimadima> lol what
[08:57:08] <dimadima> does that work?
[08:57:19] <manicennui> That is how some people would like it to work.
[08:57:37] <manicennui> This guy probably likes gantt charts too.
[08:58:04] <dimadima> i wonder if people can make that work successfully
[08:58:07] <dimadima> somewhere, somehow
[08:58:25] <dimadima> that can work if you're doing the same project the 4th time
[08:58:28] <dimadima> with the same people
[08:58:44] <manicennui> Maybe.
[08:58:49] <manicennui> But why would you do that in software?
[08:59:01] <manicennui> Not doing things multiple times is kind of the point.
[08:59:05] <dimadima> to have a semblance of control
[08:59:13] <dimadima> and to try to succeed at delivering "on time"
[08:59:22] <manicennui> I meant why not do it once in a way where you can reuse it?
[09:00:03] <dimadima> well i was being a bit facetious
[09:00:15] <manicennui> I did actually have a job once that was kind of like that.
[09:00:20] <dimadima> how was it
[09:00:23] <manicennui> Not planned down to the day or whatever.
[09:00:34] <manicennui> We did integrations between our system and other hospital systems.
[09:00:38] <manicennui> There was a lot of reuse.
[09:00:50] <dimadima> did that kind of process work ok?
[09:01:07] <manicennui> But the basics of each integration were similar, then there were customizations.
[09:01:20] <manicennui> Well, again, it was never that regimented.
[09:01:56] <manicennui> But one developer would usually be assigned to a new hospital and we would give them rough estimates.
[09:02:27] <manicennui> There were so many other aspects to coordinate that it could rarely be planned that precisely.
[09:03:10] <manicennui> But it's one of the few cases I can think of where I basically did the same project multiple times.
[09:03:44] <dimadima> i bet it's kind of possible if those are the circumstances and all the developers are more or less experienced and it's all boring tech and you can't deviate
[09:03:50] <dimadima> just get er done
[09:04:48] <manicennui> We definitely have PMs at work who want things to work that way.
[09:04:59] <manicennui> Then get upset when things never go according to their plan.
[09:05:21] <manicennui> My team is in a very good place. We are nearly kanban and everyone likes that we focus on the highest priority.
[09:05:43] <manicennui> We don't get to some stuff, but it is because it isn't important enough, and everyone realizes this.

[19:56:30] <dimadima> amazon sucks
[19:56:39] <dimadima> i always at least try not to buy something there
[19:56:42] <dimadima> i should try harder
[19:56:52] <dimadima> they have people here, and i'm sure most places, delivering with their personal cars and stuff
[19:57:01] <dimadima> that's always such a net loss for the person
[19:57:20] <gwozniak> "independent contractors"
[19:57:22] <dimadima> even with a hefty mileage allowance

[19:57:50] <dimadima> it makes no sense and it sucks
[19:58:32] <dimadima> i liked zuboff's little history of this

[19:59:34] <dimadima> “The new conception was operationalized by economists Michael Jensen and William Meckling. Leaning heavily on Hayek’s work, the two scholars took an ax to the pro-social principles of the twentieth-century corporation, an ax that became known as the “shareholder value movement.”

[20:43:12] <manicennui> Most warehouse jobs suck ass.
[20:43:48] <manicennui> People seem to have given up on caring about what companies like Walmart do.
[20:44:41] <manicennui> I had a warehouse job pulling orders for a pet supply distributor. We had quotas, there was no AC in the summer, and people go injured.
[20:44:48] <manicennui> got
[20:46:09] <manicennui> In general, most blue collar jobs suck.
[20:46:16] <manicennui> Unless it is some kind of trade with a union or something.
[20:47:46] <manicennui> Most white collar office jobs suck too unless you are some kind of professional.
[20:48:25] <manicennui> Not usually physically demanding, but it is super common to have bosses on powertrips.
[20:49:44] <gwozniak> Power trips are common across all kinds of jobs, I expect
[20:50:01] <manicennui> Yeah, but professionals generally have more options.
[20:50:08] <manicennui> They have to pretend they care about us somewhat
[20:50:45] <manicennui> I don't know many software developers who are threatened for coming in 2 minutes late and other nonsense like that.
[20:51:07] <manicennui> But that stuff happens all the time for hourly office jobs.
[20:51:07] <gwozniak> My sister is a doctor and her boss (soon not to be her boss, mind you) is (supposedly) a doctor too, but is an anti-vaxxer and a "MAGA" person
[20:51:55] <gwozniak> Just an all-round fuckhead, but managed to stay high in upper management in the medical world
[20:52:00] <dimadima> the fuck
[20:52:01] <manicennui> That sucks
[20:52:14] <manicennui> I think any doctor who is anti-vaxx should lose their license.
[20:52:31] <gwozniak> He kept the position because of some merger thing and now they are finally getting rid of him
[20:52:37] <gwozniak> manicennui: agreed
[20:52:48] <manicennui> I guess it depends on exactly what his position is though.
[20:53:15] <manicennui> I think anti-mandate people are assholes too and don't care what happens to them, but I don't know that that is enough to lose one's medical license.
[20:53:27] <manicennui> Assuming they still agree that the vaccine works and is a good idea for most people.
[20:53:48] <gwozniak> Nah, this guy flouted the lockdown rules and generally doesn't seem to give a shit about anyone but him
[20:53:54] <manicennui> And whether he is against other vaccines.
[20:54:13] <dimadima> manicennui: so what you're saying is that There Is No Ethical Consumption Under Capitalism?
[20:54:30] <gwozniak> My sister knows he lied about staying home to quarantine after visiting the US last year at this time
[20:54:50] <manicennui> dimadima: I'm just saying that if that is your reason, you should probably investigate the other companies you use too.
[20:54:55] <manicennui> But you can do whatever you like.
[20:55:13] <dimadima> :)
[20:55:17] <manicennui> People were super upset about the Foxconn stuff and Apple, but that is how virtually all electronics are made.
[20:55:27] <dimadima> i actually went to walmart.com after all that and then was like
[20:55:34] <dimadima> "wtf walmart sucks too why am i here?"
[20:55:54] <dimadima> many of the same delivery ppl around here who do amazon also do walmart, and concurrently, at that
[20:56:01] <manicennui> I think you'd have a hard time finding truly ethical sources of products, and an even harder time finding products that are made ethically.
[20:56:15] <manicennui> I do think that Target is at least marginally better than Walmart.
[20:56:21] <dimadima> There Is No Ethical Consumption Under Capitalism
[20:56:21] <manicennui> As is Costco.
[20:56:30] <dimadima> yeah my mind went to target next lol
[20:56:36] <gwozniak> Costco is at least good to the people who work in the store
[20:56:36] <dimadima> didn't consider costco
[20:58:33] <manicennui> I am actually strongly considering switching most of my shopping to Target.
[20:58:47] <manicennui> They will ship, do same day delivery, or pickup, or I can just go there.
[20:58:58] <manicennui> And they are better than Amazon for a lot of paper/home goods.
[21:00:34] <manicennui> And they do groceries.
[21:01:06] <manicennui> My reason for not wanting to use Amazon is more because their service sucks than anything.
[21:02:03] <manicennui> Tired of wading through their third-party sellers, their prices and inventory on things like paper products are bad...
[21:02:20] <manicennui> Their carrier is a mixed bag.
[21:05:49] <manicennui> I need to get away from having things delivered so much though. Packages go missing once in a while.

[21:09:58] <buttsbot> silverelan comments on An Amazon driver was told she would be fired if she stopped delivering packages during tornado warnings: report
[21:10:15] <manicennui> "I worked in a call center for a major delivery company on 9/11. A customer called wanting us to have the driver recover a package from the WTC that had been delivered earlier that morning."
[21:21:54] <dimadima> we do a fair bit at target but obviously target is limited compared to amazon
[21:22:53] <dimadima> target service has been fine, too
[21:23:00] <manicennui> I looked over my last several months of purchases at Amazon and determined that it would be pretty easy to buy things locally.
[21:23:09] <dimadima> they make a lot of mistakes and they never hassle you about them
[21:23:15] <manicennui> Target has their own same-day delivery company called Shipt. I haven't tried it yet.
[21:23:41] <dimadima> it's the amazon/walmart contractors :)
[21:24:00] <manicennui> Shipt also delivers for CVS, which I have used.
[21:24:03] <manicennui> It has been fine for that.
[21:24:29] <dimadima> CVS/target have a thing going on around here
[21:24:33] <dimadima> it's the pharmacy at their stores
[21:24:43] <manicennui> "Having a Shipt membership enables customers to place orders for products from local retailers such as ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, Costco,[20] CVS, Harris Teeter, H-E-B, Jewel Osco, Kroger, Lucky's Market, Meijer,[21] Office Depot, OfficeMax, Publix, Safeway, Shaw's and Star Market, Target, Roche Bros.,ShopRite and Winn-Dixie."

[21:34:11] <dimadima> what do you think about the typings on this function manicennui https://gist.github.com/dminkovsky/58c37b6868a845018fc5a4da3741b0e2
[21:34:12] <buttsbot> gist:58c37b6868a845018fc5a4da3741b0e2 · GitHub
[21:34:22] <dimadima> ReturnType<InviteLinkDao['load']>
[21:34:47] <dimadima> given your expressed dubiousness towards typings
[21:35:00] <dimadima> recently expressed
[21:35:02] <manicennui> I don't even understand what that means
[21:35:33] <manicennui> What does the string do there?
[21:35:45] <dimadima> it's that funky
[21:36:08] <dimadima> since TS is typings for JS, they seem to go really hard on being JS-idiomatic
[21:36:21] <dimadima> to the point where in a typing you can refer to a property of an object using that notation
[21:36:26] <dimadima> from JS
[21:36:30] <manicennui> Oh.
[21:36:31] <dimadima> object['property']
[21:36:53] <manicennui> So it's basically going to dynamically set the generic type?
[21:37:01] <dimadima> yeah
[21:37:08] <manicennui> Kind of gross.
[21:37:18] <dimadima> this function is basically a proxy for `this.inviteLinkDao.load(userId)`
[21:37:29] <dimadima> so i'm saying the return type is whatever `this.inviteLinkDao.load` returns
[21:37:34] <dimadima> lol
[21:38:06] <manicennui> Oh, so it is not even the value of object['property'], it is the type?
[21:38:23] <dimadima> yeah, cause its 'being using the context of a type
[21:38:26] <dimadima> exactly that
[21:38:41] <manicennui> I thought it was going to evaluate object['property'] and use that as the type.
[21:38:48] <dimadima> it can do that too, but that's not that
[21:38:53] <manicennui> I didn't really think about the whole function/slot thing.
[21:39:06] <dimadima> if you do `typeof object['property']` it will dynamically generate a type for that property at compile-time
[21:39:21] <dimadima> i used that to generate types based on fixtures i save from actual API calls
[21:39:59] <manicennui> At that point I'm not sure whether the type checking is adding much.
[21:40:43] <dimadima> that's the question
[21:40:56] <dimadima> and what makes TS fun
[21:41:08] <dimadima> you can go "lite" or "hard" on the typings
[21:41:18] <manicennui> I also don't fully understand the relationship between InviteLinkDao and this. InviteLinkDao.
[21:41:54] <manicennui> Is InviteLinkDao in the type declaration shorthand for this.InviteLinkDao?
[21:41:57] <dimadima> up top in that class I have `        private readonly inviteLinkDao: InviteLinkDao,`
[21:42:05] <dimadima> it's a composed instance
[21:42:16] <dimadima> that i'm using in that function
[21:42:19] <manicennui> Sure, but why do you have to use this at all then?
[21:42:31] <dimadima> oh that's not related to TS
[21:42:32] <manicennui> It's not clear to me why you do it in one place and not the other.
[21:42:55] <dimadima> i could inline that call
[21:43:07] <dimadima> it's just literally that file is getting huge
[21:43:12] <dimadima> and i'm trying to split it out
[21:43:22] <dimadima> and not all uses are just proxies
[21:44:18] <manicennui> It seems to me that the OO stuff is making this code worse.
[21:44:29] <manicennui> And the type stuff seems a bit too clever.
[21:44:29] <dimadima> quite possibly
[21:44:52] <dimadima> it's not very clever
[21:45:03] <dimadima> it's just kind of silly, hence i posted
[21:45:05] <manicennui> Is the entire purpose of this just to do this call async?
[21:45:06] <dimadima> for your amusement
[21:45:16] <dimadima> no actually if you refresh that gist i removed the async
[21:45:18] <dimadima> it was unnecessary
[21:45:49] <dimadima> i could get into the "architecture" of this code
[21:45:56] <dimadima> but then i'd have to explain how my backend is "architected"
[21:46:03] <dimadima> which is probably no a good use of this channel
[21:46:19] <manicennui> So this entire method is really just delegation?
[21:46:27] <dimadima> yes that's what i meant by "proxy"
[21:46:34] <dimadima> exactly that
[21:46:37] <dimadima> delegation
[21:46:42] <manicennui> Sorry, I do so little JS/TS
[21:47:10] <dimadima> not sure why sorry
[21:47:52] <dimadima> TS just lets you get really fast and loose with the types
[21:47:56] <manicennui> In ruby with activesupport this would be delegate :method to :class.
[21:48:02] <dimadima> but they're still very strongly enforced by the compiler
[21:48:21] <dimadima> that `inviteLinkDao.load` function itself has a fun typing
[21:48:50] <dimadima> it calls a graphql API to get its data, and its return type is the return type of the graphql call, which is generated from the graphql query
[21:49:27] <dimadima> you know, a compiler is run against the graphql to create TS typings
[21:51:26] <dimadima> https://gist.github.com/dminkovsky/10c95b52a7e0116580023c57076b2d02
[21:51:27] <buttsbot> InviteLinkDao.ts · GitHub
[21:52:02] <dimadima> the type `InviteLinkDaoLoadQuery` is generated from the query
[21:52:46] <dimadima> pardon my enthusiasm for TS :)
[21:53:32] <dimadima>  like how it lets you be lazy but not lazy at the same time w/ the law of demeter
[21:54:30] <dimadima> it lets you easily define types for each layer of software without any boilerplate or ceremony
[21:58:15] <manicennui> dimadima: This all sounds like dynamic typing with clever hacks to pretend like you are doing static typing.
[21:58:51] <manicennui> You might as well have an Any type.
[21:59:09] <imode> you have described typescript.
[21:59:20] <manicennui> Looks like TS has an Any type.
[21:59:26] <manicennui> And now Go does too!
[22:00:00] <manicennui> imode: But this isn't even static type checking.
[22:00:18] <manicennui> At least many of the TS types are checked statically.
[22:00:55] <manicennui> Actually I guess it might not be that bad. I don't fully understand the graphQL part.
[22:01:11] <manicennui> If it is happening statically, then whatever.
[22:01:35] <manicennui> I read the first part and thought he meant that it would be typed based on what is returned at runtime.
[22:02:32] <manicennui> I have a bad habit of reading the first few lines of what was said while I was gone, responding to that, then reading more.
[22:10:35] <manicennui> Last night I started reading a bit about Elixir and Phoenix. I really want what the BEAM VM claims to provide, and Elixir looks pretty interesting, but I couldn't find many Elixir jobs.
[22:10:49] <manicennui> Mostly it is listed in a long list of random languages (hate that shit) in job ads.
[22:11:13] <manicennui> What I really want is Clojure on the BEAM VM with the JVM ecossystem.
[22:11:21] <manicennui> ecosystem
[22:11:44] <manicennui> Need to take a look at the Erlang ecosystem.
[22:16:32] <dimadima> it's definitely static type checking
[22:16:50] <dimadima> my ts config in fact disallows the any type
[22:17:02] <dimadima> well, at least implicit usage of it, and warns on explicit usage of it
[22:17:36] <dimadima> this is definitely not dynamic typing
[22:17:57] <dimadima> this thing at the top of HN https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635/rr-80
[22:17:58] <buttsbot> Open letter from The BMJ to Mark Zuckerberg | The BMJ
[22:19:44] <manicennui> "The BMJ, one of the world’s oldest and most influential general medical journals"
[22:19:47] <manicennui> Is that true?
[22:20:16] <gwozniak> Pretty sure it's been around for a long time
[22:20:24] <manicennui> Sure, I don't doubt the old part.
[22:20:32] <manicennui> I guess they could also be influential and wrong.
[22:20:40] <gwozniak> It's the one medical journal I can remember being cited in the news when I was a kid
[22:20:49] <manicennui> Just trying to figure out how seriously I should take this.
[22:21:08] <dimadima> pretty sure it's not a "news blog"
[22:21:37] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BMJ#Cello_scrotum_hoax_article

[22:21:38] <manicennui> heh
[22:22:16] <manicennui> I just know that HN has a decent sized contingency of conspiracy theorists.
[22:22:53] <imode> they lurk among us.
[22:23:51] <manicennui> On the surface, their beef sounds legit. I think the problem is that most Facebook users are too dumb to evaluate information like this.
[22:24:09] <dimadima> that's true
[22:24:11] <manicennui> Not that I think that is a reason to censor it necessarily.
[22:24:13] <dimadima> given what we've seen
[22:24:20] <manicennui> I don't really know what the answer is.
[22:24:33] <manicennui> It probably isn't changing minds one way or another.
[22:25:27] <manicennui> I don't think the average person can handle cases where something is both good but also has some flaws.
[22:25:48] <manicennui> It has to be all good or all bad.
[22:27:19] <manicennui> I don't even think most people benefit from information appearing in medical journals because they don't have the ability to evaluate it properly.
[22:27:19] <dimadima> yep
[22:27:25] <dimadima> yep
[22:27:36] <dimadima> what to do
[22:28:11] <manicennui> This idea that everyone can do their own research is fanciful.
[22:29:33] <manicennui> On the one hand, I don't doubt that clinical trials are a shitshow and the FDA is highly corrupt.
[22:29:47] <manicennui> But that also doesn't mean the FDA is bad.
[22:29:56] <manicennui> And we have pretty solid evidence now that the vaccines are safe.
[22:30:25] <manicennui> So this will mostly just serve as confirmation bias for conspiracy theorists and idiots.
[22:32:23] <manicennui> Sweet. Someone on HN compared Facebook's fact checking to the Inquisition.
[22:33:28] <manicennui> This might be one of the more sane positions: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29596610

[22:34:27] <manicennui> Far too many comments about all of this being part of a conspiracy to "control the narrative".
[22:34:41] <manicennui> Which might be factually true, but it is being done to try to save lives.
[22:34:49] <manicennui> Not to achieve some sinister plot.
[22:36:54] <manicennui> Pretty difficult to have nuanced discussions about this stuff, especially with people who want everything to fall neatly into a simple system of logic.

[22:42:18] <manicennui> Seems to pretty thoroughly debunk BMJ's claims.
[22:42:24] <manicennui> And puts them in context.
[22:42:59] <manicennui> "The BMJ reported patient safety and data integrity were likely compromised by the practices of Ventavia Research Group, a contractor that oversaw three of the 153 sites where Pfizer trials on 46,000 patients were conducted. BMJ relied on copies of reports filed by a two-week employee of Ventavia."
[22:43:33] <manicennui> "In an article in MedPage, vaccine experts said the claims are not serious enough to jeopardize Pfizer's data."
[22:44:00] <manicennui> "A spokesperson for Texas-based Ventavia Research Group wrote in a November 10, 2021, email to Lead Stories that BMJ did not seek comment in advance of the report. If it had, it would have been told the employee's report was investigated but found wanting, the spokesperson said."
[22:47:50] <dimadima> the whole 'fact checking' thing though
[22:48:10] <dimadima> is gauche
[22:49:05] <manicennui> Yeah, but what is the alternative?
[22:49:20] <manicennui> No one is going to build a team of experts on every subject to do real fact checking.
[22:49:24] <dimadima> call it something else
[22:49:37] <dimadima> " No one is going to build a team of experts on every subject to do real fact checking." btw why not
[22:49:40] <manicennui> What would that really change?
[22:49:41] <dimadima> facebook is freaking huge
[22:49:47] <dimadima> if they wanted to be awesome
[22:49:50] <dimadima> and have a great PR
[22:49:51] <dimadima> they would
[22:49:54] <manicennui> How?
[22:50:01] <dimadima> they coul dbe like
[22:50:08] <manicennui> In some fields, the only experts are the ones doing the research.
[22:50:10] <dimadima> 'here's our team of globalist elite college nerds'
[22:50:17] <dimadima> and they could totally make a whole media thing out of it
[22:50:23] <gwozniak> Just a quick look at the "Lead Stories" site gives the impression its all about clicks and not facts
[22:50:29] <gwozniak> Didn't read it yet, though
[22:50:31] <manicennui> How often do NY Times fact checkers get something wrong?
[22:50:32] <dimadima> like instead of a toothless nameles thing called Lead Stories
[22:50:38] <dimadima> they could make these ppl public influencers
[22:50:40] <manicennui> NY Times definitely does retractions and corrections.
[22:50:51] <manicennui> gwozniak: Yeah, I don't know anything about it.
[22:51:03] <manicennui> gwozniak: But that particular article links to many other sources.
[22:51:32] <manicennui> At best it seems like BMJ is being hyperbolic, and the person who reported the problems is questionable.
[22:52:34] <dimadima> at the end of the day the fact that you can't share a link that the BMJ is doubling down on
[22:52:37] <dimadima> is pretty crazy
[22:52:43] <dimadima> it's not like they're retracting, they're doing the opposite
[22:52:51] <manicennui> Why should that matter?
[22:53:02] <dimadima> cause they _are_ the experts
[22:53:06] <manicennui> Being adamant doesn't make something more correct.
[22:53:15] <dimadima> they're not being adamant
[22:53:15] <manicennui> dimadima: And other experts have disputed their claims.
[22:53:30] <dimadima> they're saying we, of all humans, know a lot about this
[22:53:33] <dimadima> the most, in fact
[22:53:38] <manicennui> What?
[22:53:42] <manicennui> I don't think that is what they are saying.
[22:53:52] <dimadima> they're saying we are BMJ
[22:54:03] <dimadima> we are a group of experts in medicine
[22:54:04] <manicennui> Yeah, appealing to authority is always wrong.
[22:54:12] <dimadima> they're not appealing to authority
[22:54:14] <manicennui> You are right or wrong based on evidence.
[22:54:21] <dimadima> they're appealing to evicence based science that was conducted
[22:54:26] <dimadima> and they're saying was conducted
[22:54:33] <dimadima> and is being reported on in this piece
[22:54:40] <manicennui> And the evidence suggests that they are being hyperbolic and relying on a questionable person's claims.
[22:54:46] <manicennui> No, they say they are.
[22:55:38] <manicennui> Their "evidence" is all from one person who worked at one company that had a small part in the clinical trials making questionable claims.
[22:55:46] <gwozniak> But we have to appeal to authority on some level, because we can't all evaluate things
[22:55:55] <manicennui> And it is clear that person also has an agenda.
[22:56:17] <manicennui> gwozniak: All of us should, not the people claiming to rely on evidence.
[22:56:36] <manicennui> Each of us doesn't need to do our own research, but the people claiming to do research do.
[22:56:42] <manicennui> They can't just say, "We are the BMJ!"
[22:57:39] <manicennui> But appealing to authority with medicine is a losing battle because everyone can find some doctor with impressive credentials to say something crazy.
[22:58:17] <gwozniak> I agree the BMJ should be more forthcoming about evidence, if that's what this needs
[22:58:41] <manicennui> It's much easier to see the problem when you consider software. Some journalist can write that "John Carmack said" and a large number of people will see that as evidence.
[22:58:48] <gwozniak> It's not a losing battle overall
[22:58:55] <manicennui> But most of us know that you can ask 50 different software engineers and get 50 different answers.
[22:59:18] <companion_cube> but uncle bob said
[23:00:09] <manicennui> gwozniak: It seems like they didn't request comment from the company they accused, left out various pieces of information about what was actually claimed, what was done in response, mischaracterized the FDA's response, and the entire thing relies on some super questionable person.
[23:00:28] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yes, but Rich Hickey disagrees, and he looks the most like Jesus.
[23:00:54] <companion_cube> he's a bit too white for that 🤔
[23:02:36] <manicennui> gwozniak: I think this is the problem with "facts". Think about the idiots sharing this thing. The company in question ran 3 of 153 clinical trial sites. The claims were investigated. The person who made the claims is on Twitter complaining about Sesame Street talking about vaccines.
[23:03:06] <manicennui> You know the only reason people share this shit is to confirm their biases.
[23:03:15] <manicennui> They aren't interested in the rigor of clinical trials.
[23:04:10] <manicennui> It's like the idiots claiming there is widespread voter fraud.
[23:04:16] <manicennui> Probably the same idiots in most cases.
[23:04:40] <manicennui> Why the BMJ wants to die on this hill I don't know.
[23:05:03] <manicennui> I assume they are aware of the counterclaims.
[23:06:14] <manicennui> That being said, it does seem true that the fact checking company probably didn't know all of this.
[23:06:38] <manicennui> I don't know what the answer is to preventing half the population from fucking us all with information they find on Facebook.
[23:08:32] <manicennui> I do think it is a bit convenient that all of this supposed libertarians on HN change their principles when it comes to private companies doing something they don't like.
[23:08:50] <manicennui> They also seem confused about the first amendment.
[23:09:34] <manicennui> I mostly feel like the censorship of content by private companies is a non-issue.
[23:10:02] <manicennui> If you don't like what a company is doing, stop using them.
[23:10:08] <manicennui> Facebook is not a necessity.
