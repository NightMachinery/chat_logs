[01:45:51] <xx> btw, if some code was licensed under one license, and then completely removed from the codebase, then I can presumably remove mention of it from the license file. However, the old versions will still hang around in git forever, so what's the legal situation with that?
[01:46:04] <xx> sounds very much like a lawyer question
[01:46:12] <yrk> xx: not really
[01:46:32] <yrk> xx: first, let me mention that you can get an official answer from the fsf by writing in to licensing@fsf.org
[01:46:51] <yrk> xx: but regarding the question, git is just a fancy way of distributing code
[01:47:22] <yrk> xx: if you are distributing software under licenses A and B, then those licenses must be abided by regardless if it is done by ftp, cvs, git, darcs, pigeon, etc.
[01:48:07] <yrk> xx: when this becomes a real problem (old code with bad licenses in the VC history), the recommendation is to simply make a repo with an edited history without the offending code
[01:48:13] <yrk> xx: all good VCs allow that
[01:48:18] <xx> makes sense. So a git history rewrite would need to happen, to purge the incompatible licensing code, so that everything is ok.
[01:48:41] <xx> yeah, it's pretty clear, don't need a lawyer for that now, you explained it very well, thanks
[01:48:52] <yrk> xx: indeed, distribution is distribution
[01:49:06] <xx> basically I can tell someone that "git is like a big zip archive, so the stuff is still in there"
[01:49:25] <xx> which should be understandable even to a person who knows very little about computing

[12:55:09] *** Parts: peach (sid482179@charlton.irccloud.com) ()
[12:56:20] <DiffieHellman> kittyblam: The rx580 line is almost fully libre thanks to AMDGPU, but unfortunately the VBIOS and firmware are nonfree. 
[12:57:31] <DiffieHellman> The only way to get a working GPU from that line would be to tell linux-libre not to patch out AMDGPU and include that as a module. 
[12:59:14] <kittyblam> https://h-node.org/videocards/view/en/2024/Advanced-Micro-Devices--Inc---AMD-ATI--Ellesmere--Radeon-RX-470-480-570-570X-580-580X-/1/1/undef/undef/undef/undef/video-card-works/rx%20580 seems to have been some level of success without doing that?
[12:59:30] <DiffieHellman> Ah yeah I completely forgot.
[13:00:29] <DiffieHellman> The rx580 line works okay under the radeonsi without firmware, but sleep won't work and maybe performance won't be as good. VBIOS is still nonfree unfortunately.
[13:00:50] <kittyblam> VBIOS?
[13:02:07] <kittyblam> ah
[13:02:15] <DiffieHellman> GPU's most of the time have their own BIOS. Sometimes the computer BIOS will load a VBIOS onto the GPU. As the VBIOS is replaceable, it's not really counted as hardware/
[13:03:15] <kittyblam> Is the VBIOS on the GTX780 line able yet to be free?
[13:04:05] <DiffieHellman> I haven't researched that GPU, but it'll most likely be nonfree and there probably isn't a free replacement.
[13:04:27] <DiffieHellman> Nvidia actually started signing the VBIOS and firmware past a certain generation.
[13:05:55] <kittyblam> Ye, the two gpus I mentioned are two ones I have heard talked about a bit in terms of gpus compatible with free software, particularly the gtx780. What, if any, gpus are you aware of that would fit as being a relatively more/most open?
[13:06:18] <kittyblam> both in terms of something that could be done right now, but also, if you are aware, are there any projects planned that could mean a better situation in the near to medium future?
