[00:27:56] <skye0> ah, forza horizon 5
[00:28:18] <skye0> wonderful since i can put my guy in a cute dress and make a car go fast off-road, even if they weren't originally designed to do so
[00:28:24] <ThePendulum> lol
[00:28:28] <ThePendulum> forza looks so good but the physics really put me off
[00:28:34] <ThePendulum> not just bugs like this but any airtime looks super cheesy
[00:28:46] <skye0> only game i truly enjoy though because it's difficult to mess up progression - worst case scenario is wasting a lot of credits
[00:29:28] <skye0> in the sims 4, one wrong move and forgetting to save means a lot of hours wasted. dynasty warriors 9 empires is worse - one battle you're unprepared for and you could end up losing officers, even those you created. some will even decide to no longer fight for you
[00:29:54] <ThePendulum> hm right, I don't think I ever really played the sims in story mode heh
[00:30:09] <skye0> i don't too but i just create my own little stories that i don't want to mess up

[18:07:49] <rawktucc> so I'm looking at an M.2 enclosure for an external drive to use travelling
[18:08:01] <evilgohan2> Sabrent
[18:08:05] <evilgohan2> or StarTech.com
[18:08:23] <rawktucc> what about getting a 2in1 unit, something that supports NVME and SATA NGFF
[18:08:29] <rawktucc> or something from aliexpress
[18:08:48] <rawktucc> https://www.ebay.ca/itm/265584193234 this looks good but the shipping is killer
[18:08:53] <rawktucc> stupid import charges
[18:09:00] <evilgohan2> I know nothing of what's available on aliexpress. StarTech is a manufacturer, and a seller and makes damn near everything.
[18:09:51] <evilgohan2> Also, I'd avoid that specific listing. I question any seller who can't match up what they're selling with the description of their item
[18:09:55] <evilgohan2> "Up for sale is WYZE Smart Scale S"
[18:10:03] <rawktucc> 0_0
[18:10:11] <rawktucc> i did buy a thinkpad listed as using DDR3 RAM
[18:10:15] <evilgohan2> lmao
[18:10:26] <rawktucc> when it clearly only supported ddr4
[18:10:41] <rawktucc> this is one other alternative https://www.primecables.ca/p-395108-cab-ssd-2802s-ngff-ssd
[18:11:03] <rawktucc> the problem is it's sata only, it feels like a waste. they also sell a pcie unit, but the JMS583 chip seems to be PCIE/NVME only, not PCIE + SATA
[18:11:33] <rawktucc> i have the sata m.2 only because i was going to replace my hdd boot drive in my server with it, since it would just use the same SATA port, instead of a PCIe Lane or port
[18:11:53] <evilgohan2> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T8F298Y
[18:11:59] <rawktucc> startech has a few available but they're about 60+shipping, and only SATA or pcie
[18:12:03] <unfinity> ・゜゜ ​ ・。。・゜゜\_ó<​ QUAC​K!
[18:12:05] <evilgohan2> ,bef
[18:12:06] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 2.931 seconds! You have made friends with 218 ducks in #datahoarder.
[18:12:32] <rawktucc> I don't shop on amazon unfortunately
[18:12:36] <rawktucc> but yes that looks good
[18:12:48] <rawktucc> but it's sata only
[18:12:57] <rawktucc> im questioning if it's worth getting a sata only enclosure, I mean, idk
[18:12:57] <evilgohan2> Just pointing out devices. Not necessarily somewhere you need to purchase from
[18:13:44] <rawktucc> https://www.ebay.ca/itm/183875984007 wtf
[18:14:14] <evilgohan2> Seems most of these are not NVMe compatible - which makes sense as that's pretty much asking for a PCI-e to USB3 adapter.
[18:14:32] <rawktucc> the 10Gb https://www.ebay.ca/itm/173545427255 is actually cheaper since it's on sale lol
[18:14:52] <rawktucc> still this is a $15 more than the primecables one
[18:14:56] <rawktucc> if im only getting a SATA unit
[18:15:04] <rawktucc> i just dont get how sabrent can do 2in1
