[01:55:43] <ash_worksi> cassepipe: don't worry about it
[01:57:03] <ash_worksi> cassepipe: I ended up just doing yy, P, <down>, :s/Mon/Tues, P, <down>, :<up><delete Tues>Wednes, ... etc

[01:57:32] <ash_worksi> cassepipe: I just didn't want to repeat the pattern I just said using lowercase
[01:57:52] <cassepipe> ash_worksi: Glad you found your way out of it
[01:58:05] <ash_worksi> since the code looks like `?DateTime MondayBusinessHours $mondayBusinessHours` for each day of the week
[01:59:41] <cassepipe> ash_worksi: Also just %s/Mon/Tues and then %s/mon/tue would work too
[01:59:53] <cassepipe> I gueeeess
[02:00:04] <ash_worksi> cassepipe: no, that replaces all instances of Mon with Tues
[02:00:21] <ash_worksi> I was working line by line, replacing Tues, then Wednes, then Thrus, etc
[02:00:31] <ash_worksi> but they were all Mon to begin with
[02:00:37] <cassepipe> ash_worksi: Actually just the first occurence on each line if I want to be pedantic :)

[06:12:31] <dre> I know that I can do, like, a diff or something, so that the scroll in one shows up as a scroll in the other, but that's for the same buffer.
[06:13:19] <dre> alternatively, perhaps I can just temp remap j => <C-w>hj<C-w>lj

[08:18:19] <leduyquang753> After you opened the Python file, the auto commands have already executed, so simply setting filetype plugin off after that won't properly work.
[08:18:38] <YuGiOhJCJ> not sure if I have a good reason, it is just that for me indentation should always be with the tab character no matter the language you use, you can for example consider that one character instead of four is a huge improvement for the source code file size, also a tab character can be visually represented as you want if you have a good text editor
[08:19:00] <leduyquang753> Hey, exactly my points of using tabs too. :)

[11:27:39] <habamax> in the screenshot there is folding(indent), list, and help special chars are not concealed, maybe there is more that I can't see :)
[11:28:13] <habamax> xy -- I have my own <C-w>o that toggles :only
[11:28:36] <habamax> and upon restoring window layout, help buffers are "corrupted"
[11:28:51] <romainl> I was under the impression that :help foo did some help-specific logic that :b <help file> or :e <helpfile> wouldn't
[11:28:51] <digmbot> :help foo -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/various.txt.html#%2Bfooter
[11:29:19] <habamax> I have the same impression, did search vim source but couldn't find it

[14:03:01] <gnod> Sometimes when I open a file from nerdtree (via return) it does not open it directly but first prompts me to "Press ENTER or type command to continue". I was never able to figure out why. Any ideas?
[14:03:54] <romainl> filename may be too long to fit in the command line
[14:04:09] <gnod> Command line?

[14:05:55] <gnod> romainl: Why does this happen?
[14:06:51] <romainl> when you open a file, Vim shows a message in the command line. if the command line is too short for that message you get a "press return" message

[14:44:41] <huf> yeah

[14:46:24] <habamax> indeed :)
[14:54:22] <vvdaiwrw> huf: you should move to other things, as far as I remember, ctrlp is slow by nature.
[14:55:39] <huf> it's perfectly fine otherwise
[14:55:52] <huf> but yeah, should probably move on to something else, i'm just used to it
[14:57:04] <vvdaiwrw> "perfectly fine" was my impression as well, until I notice the instant speed feel when I tried another thing.
[14:57:36] <huf> look this isnt about how fast it is
[14:57:47] <huf> it's clearly a bug because it slows down when there's nothing else to find
[14:58:55] <vvdaiwrw> it's slow by default, extremely slow in worst case searches
[14:59:01] <huf> ...
[14:59:59] <lericson> speaking of slow, jesus christ how do people tolerate intellisense in visual studio code
[15:00:20] <vvdaiwrw> no idea, I never tried
[15:01:06] <lericson> what i love about the stupid keyword completion is that it always does what you think it will, and it always does it in the blink of an eye
[15:02:24] <habamax> lericson: they do it "slowly but surely" in vscode
[15:02:30] <vvdaiwrw> doesn't vscode's intellisense have basic keyword completion fallback until semantic completion is ready?
[15:03:00] <lericson> mine certainly doesn't, vvdaiwrw, and i think that would be even more jarring as it'd create one of those horrible autocomplete-bait-and-switch by timing

[16:59:38] <m4r35n357> it is just the filename

[17:01:48] <m4r35n357> but only on one computer, this one is fine
[17:01:53] <habamax> why do you think it is wrong?
[17:02:24] <m4r35n357> because it contains old code, including a function that is no longer there
[17:02:39] <habamax> does it happen with vim -Nu NONE?
[17:02:50] <m4r35n357> but it works perfectly on this machine

[17:05:41] <m4r35n357> that stops ctags from working
[17:05:48] <habamax> I mean run vim without any configs/plugins, open a offending file and goto that tag
[17:06:11] <habamax> m4r35n357: then smth is wrong with your setup, cause vim has nothing to do with ctags
[17:06:29] <habamax> executable, it uses tags file produced by it
[17:06:43] <m4r35n357> so, if it is ctags, I can't find any file paths or anything in the tag file

[17:09:24] <habamax> imagine your tags file having several targets for the same tag...

[17:10:00] <m4r35n357> habamax, yes, I havem seen that, but this is all under source control, there is only one version of the file that I am navigating to
[17:10:24] <m4r35n357> it is a recognizable version from about a week or two ago . . .
[17:10:28] <OMGOMG> m4r35n357: how do you make your tags?
[17:10:47] <m4r35n357> tha is why I asked about vim, to see if it showd a commit ID for the file

[17:19:00] <romainl> "is there a command to list the files currently being edited by vim?" is the nicest example of XY I've seen in quite some time

[19:33:47] <cassepipe> Hi gods of Vimscript. I need your help. I am trying to patch a linter for Ale and all I have is some C knowledge and my weak brain.
[19:33:47] <cassepipe> I have to follow a coding norm and I have been given a program that ouptut lines like that in the shell :
[19:33:47] <cassepipe> Error: TOO_MANY_TABS_FUNC   (line:   3, col:   9): extra tabs before function name
[19:33:47] <cassepipe> So I found the pattern for it (thanks for the incsearch tip) :

[19:33:48] <cassepipe> That pattern works !

[23:53:26] <revmoo> hi I've been using vim for about a decade and I've never seen this before... I have a php file where vim freezes on two normal, plain lines of PHP when I hit 'o' to add a line. I've removed my .vimrc and ~/.vim dirs so this is vanilla vim. I notice if I hit ctrl-c it shakes it out of the frozeness (And completes adding the new line). Any idea what
[23:53:27] <revmoo> could cause something like this?
[23:54:00] <revmoo> this is just crappy wordpress PHP code (a wpdb() call and a var_dump) that is causing this which is just bizarre

[23:59:45] <m_ben> revmoo: can you post a minimal php code snippet when it happens?
