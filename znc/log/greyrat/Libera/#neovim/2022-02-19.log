[01:04:39] <_xor> Dumb question, but how are multiple commands specified for a custom command definition?
[01:04:45] <_xor> I've tried | and <Bar>, neither of which worked so far.
[01:08:44] *** Joins: peki (~peki@91.191.14.22)
[01:09:01] <_xor> Ah, looks like it's chaining execute calls.
[01:09:19] <peki> Hello! What's the discussion on?
[01:09:43] <_xor> Just trying to figure out how to define a custom command that executes multiple commands.
[01:09:58] <peki> ohhh
[01:10:22] <peki> my main approaches would be either functions or modules
[01:10:23] <ii14[m]> it's doesn't work for some commands
[01:10:36] <_xor> What's the right way to do it?
[01:10:38] <ii14[m]> for such commands you can do `exe 'command ...'`
[01:10:48] <ii14[m]> the right way is with `|`
[01:10:52] <_xor> Ah, so the original thing I tried does work in some cases?
[01:11:02] <peki> dang
[01:11:08] <ii14[m]> yes
[01:11:08] <peki> wanna show the code off?
[01:11:12] <ii14[m]> `echo 'a' | echo 'b'`
[01:11:12] <_xor> I ended up just doing: execute 'MyCommand1' | execute 'MyCommand2'
[01:11:27] <peki> yeah, that's a solid way to do it
[01:11:32] <ii14[m]> yup, that's what you have to do sometimes
[01:11:35] <_xor> Is there ever a reason to not use execute or is it just good/safe practice to always use it in cases like this one?
[01:12:00] <ii14[m]> yes, it's shorter without execute
[01:12:03] <_xor> I mean verbosity aside, and specifically in chaining commands.
[01:12:20] <peki> well, in most cases, the best practice is a syntax-friendly one
[01:12:24] <_xor> Ah ok so there aren't any corner cases where execute wouldn't work but leaving it off would work.
[01:12:28] <ii14[m]> just use it when the command doesn't support that
[01:12:39] <ii14[m]> for user commands it's the `bar` option
[01:12:49] <peki> in your case i'd just do
[01:13:00] <peki> function MyFunc()
[01:13:03] <peki> set ...
[01:13:08] <peki> endfunction
[01:13:14] <ii14[m]> so when you print commands with `:com`, the `|` symbol tells you that you can use it with `|`
[01:13:22] <peki> map <C-X> :call<space>MyFunc()<CR>

[09:24:59] <p00f> > if you look through
[09:24:59] <p00f> Indeed
[09:25:17] <arch-angel> what do you mean?
[09:26:16] <arch-angel> https://imgur.com/a/DRzvEJ9 here's how it looks like on `nano`
[09:26:20] <arch-angel> https://imgur.com/a/aJ34ZG8
[09:26:25] <arch-angel> here's how it looks like on nvim
[09:27:03] <arch-angel> i honestly don't know where to start debugging why this happens and how it happens and how I'm supposed to fix this
[09:27:22] <ii14[m]> expandtab is often set for individual filetypes
[09:27:35] <ii14[m]> that overrides noexpandtab from vimrc
[09:27:45] <ii14[m]> `au FileType * setl noexpandtab`
[09:27:54] <ii14[m]> if you want it for everything
[09:28:34] <ii14[m]> if you want it for just some filetypes, replace the `*` with for example `vim,lua,c,cpp`
[09:28:57] <arch-angel> so if I set that, it'll fix that visual problem?
[09:29:07] <ii14[m]> to debug stuff like that use `:verbose`. `:verbose set expandtab?` to check where the option was last defined
[09:29:28] <arch-angel> what's the difference between just purely doing set noexpandtab and doing au FileType * setl noexpandtab
[09:29:30] <ii14[m]> I'm talking about using tabs
[09:30:26] <ii14[m]> `set noexpandtab` is just a global option, but that can get often overridden for individual buffers
[09:30:50] <ii14[m]> for specific filetypes
[09:31:02] <arch-angel> i see
[09:31:09] <ii14[m]> like golang will always set `noexpandtab`
[09:31:24] <ii14[m]> and python sets `expandtab`
[09:32:08] <ii14[m]> `au Filetype *` creates an autocommand, it will run after the filetype was set
[09:32:14] <arch-angel> well on my markdown file it says that noexpandtab was set from :source, which probably is from my init.vim because I ran :source
[09:32:23] <ii14[m]> so after the filetype specific options are set
[09:34:27] <ii14[m]> `au` is a shorthand version for `autocmd` btw

[11:19:07] <kraftwerk28> Why does `nvim_get_hl_by_name("StatusLine", true)` return `{ foreground = ..., background = ... }`, but `nvim_get_hl_by_name("StatusLine", false)` - `{ bold = true, reverse = true }`. The hl itself is defined like `StatusLine     xxx cterm=bold,reverse guifg=#0d1117 guibg=#58a6ff`. So to get the full highlight definition I should make two calls, right?
[11:23:07] <kraftwerk28> Oh, seems that passing false works w/ cterm*, while true - w/ gui* fields
