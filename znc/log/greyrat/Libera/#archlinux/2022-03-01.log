[05:54:01] <randomhydrosol> the arch scripts currently don't support everything for proper uefi boot and a minimal bootloader like systemd-boot works well
[05:54:11] <lf94> From what I understand this removes the need for the usual installation of GRUB

[05:55:02] <randomhydrosol> I have a config for generating an efistub
[05:55:05] <thurstylark> systemd-boot is probably easier
[05:55:07] <Namarrgon> slap systemd-boot onto the ESP, write the configs
[05:55:12] <randomhydrosol> properly, with the initramfs, etc
[05:55:14] <lf94> systemd-boot it is
[05:55:18] <randomhydrosol> no secure boot though
[05:55:30] <lf94> Does that matter?
[05:55:35] <randomhydrosol> you'd need systemd-boot for secure boot
[05:55:46] <lf94> Oh sorry, you're talking efistub still

[06:01:51] <thurstylark> that also goes for the wiki
[06:01:59] <thurstylark> it's not for the wiki to make that determination for the user
[06:02:06] <thrice> Yeah, I find s-boot easy, but you might not
[06:02:16] <lf94> Wow, I think...I think that was it
[06:02:51] <lf94> Hm, couldn't we agree on what the most general definition of "easy" is, and then pick one for users?
[06:03:21] <lf94> Running bootctl install is pretty much as easy as it gets
[06:03:31] <Namarrgon> you're not done yet
[06:03:40] <thurstylark> there are definitely more steps
[06:04:13] <lf94> So now I'm at the loader configuration
[06:04:17] <thurstylark> also, no. choosing for the user is completely antithetical to Arch's whole philosophy
[06:05:05] <lf94> Hm, let me rephrase: couldn't it be suggested?

[06:05:38] <lf94> Like all the notes: "NOTE: of all the bootloaders, we recommend X for new users"
[06:05:42] <Namarrgon> many would argue that it would be easier to install a different distro, maybe the arch wiki should suggest that
[06:05:51] <lf94> Ha, maybe it should!
[06:06:00] <thurstylark> arch isn't for those who want easy
[06:06:07] <thurstylark> easy can be found elsewhere
[06:06:14] <thurstylark> simple is here
[06:06:14] <lf94> Easy is relative for sure
[06:07:06] <thrice> yeah, easy would be something like debian's grub automagic config, but most arch users probably don't want that
[06:07:51] <thurstylark> personally, I have no problem with new users not knowing what to do. It funnels them into the community where they can learn more than what the wiki can ever teach them and get support and even guidance.

[06:11:14] <randomhydrosol> Namarrgon it's not about secboot at all, the loader/arch.conf approach often results in a setup where you just hey an option to boot to firmware instead of Linux
[06:11:27] <Namarrgon> then you did it wrong

[06:11:45] <Namarrgon> randomhydrosol: but now you have to deal with creating a unified image
[06:11:49] <lf94> Are they actually different? I thought esp *was* boot
[06:11:53] <randomhydrosol> lf94 they should be the same
[06:11:58] <lf94> Ok
[06:12:03] <thrice> well, depends how you mounted thing

[06:12:14] <thurstylark> lf94: esp *can* be mounted at /boot. if that's the way you set it up, then yes, that's the case
[06:12:45] <randomhydrosol> separate /boot and /esp is mostly cruft from grub where /boot was encrypted or large
[06:12:52] <randomhydrosol> no point in doing so with systemd
[06:13:19] <lf94> Must I specify intel microcode
[06:13:23] <randomhydrosol> just mount the /esp at boot, throw your kernel, and bootloader in there and that's it
[06:13:25] <thurstylark> yes
[06:13:29] <randomhydrosol> lf94 yes
[06:13:33] <randomhydrosol> you definitely want that

[06:15:18] <randomhydrosol> yes
[06:15:24] <randomhydrosol> always in /boot
[06:15:35] <thurstylark> lf94: in the entry conf, / refers to the root of the esp

[06:15:51] <randomhydrosol> possibly missing firmware for ... is what I'm talking about
[06:15:54] <randomhydrosol> but yes
[06:16:02] <lf94> All right, last step, specifying this options root ...
[06:16:04] <randomhydrosol> you could be missing firmware even if it doesn't warn you
[06:16:06] <Scimmia> which is both misleading and incomplete
[06:16:18] <randomhydrosol> yes agreed
[06:16:34] <randomhydrosol> lf94 you can get root= from your fstab
[06:16:36] <lf94> The example on the wiki and the example file are pretty different when it comes to this line

[07:01:01] *** Quits: catman (~catman@user/catman) (Client Quit)
[07:01:35] <haritz> adding 'netconf tinyssh encryptssh' to the HOOKS in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
[07:01:52] <haritz> then adding the ip kernel parameter to grub config and regenerating it
[07:02:11] <haritz> the name I pick for the network interface is the same I get from dmesg before it gets renamed by udev
[07:02:16] <haritz> and that's it really
[07:02:16] <Scimmia> looking at the hook, it looks like it requires a systemd based initramfs, did you add that?

[07:02:29] <Scimmia> oh, nevermind, it works with both

[07:05:08] <randomhydrosol> > Since version 15.3, shim will not launch EFI binaries without a valid .sbat section
[07:05:21] <randomhydrosol> but I'm not sure why their objcopy command doesn't work
[07:05:52] <randomhydrosol> I actually just copied their own example 1:1 and even tried dumping .sbat from another image to apply it to my efistub kernel
[07:06:08] <randomhydrosol> but objcopy just says the data is invalid :\
[07:06:48] <randomhydrosol> booting efistub directly from shim results in something like "bootloader hasn't verified loaded kernel. system halted"
[07:07:15] <haritz> Scimmia: if the module wasn't found then because I added it to MODULES, mkinitcpio would complain, I suppose
[07:07:17] <haritz> which didn't happen

[08:42:11] <c209e6dc-4d76-47> how can I fix broken packages?
[08:42:20] <c209e6dc-4d76-47> something like reinstall packages with missing files?
[08:42:26] <masoudd> naicam|ne, do: pacman -Qo /usr/bin/install
[08:42:59] <masoudd> c209e6dc-4d76-47, where were the files?
[08:43:20] <c209e6dc-4d76-47> `/usr/lib/node_modules`
[08:43:30] <naicam|ne> /usr/bin/install is owned by coreutils 9.0-2
[08:44:08] <masoudd> c209e6dc-4d76-47, do pacman -Qo /usr/lib/node_modules; and reinstall those packages again I guess
[08:45:34] <masoudd> naicam|ne, do: type install;
[08:45:49] <masoudd> I want to make sure you are not using another install
[08:45:51] <naicam|ne> install is /usr/bin/install
[08:46:25] <naicam|ne> ya no worries gotta check all kinda stuff 
[08:46:42] <masoudd> naicam|ne, What have you done recently? have you made any aur packages before this?

[14:22:36] <piie> TheDcoder: maybe you're using hardware decoding with mpv and there's a bug in the gfx driver, which hung it up

[14:22:58] <TheDcoder> piie: you are right, but why can't I kill it?
[14:23:19] <TheDcoder> SIGKILL is supposed to be a no fuss kill-switch, right?
[14:23:32] <Khorne> Yes, but also no
[14:23:37] <demonicmaniac1> still cant kill a zombie
[14:23:37] <piie> there are constellations, when gfx drivers are involved, that can cause such situations

[14:24:31] <TheDcoder> demonicmaniac1: right, but in this case the parent appears to be init itself
[14:24:44] <TheDcoder> if it was something else I would've killed the parent
[14:24:52] <piie> imho you have these options: 1) restart and keep the system upated and hope this is going to be fixed by $anyone 2) restart and reproduce the issue until you have narrowed it down, then file a bug report

[18:12:59] <TheArcaneBrony> just my 2 cents tho
[18:13:10] <jelle> lf94: if you don't login to google in chromium it's the same
[18:13:23] <TheArcaneBrony> didnt chromium rip out google logins anyways?
[18:13:29] <lf94> No, chromium still uses google resources and other things.

[19:54:47] <oramirite> Hey everyone. I'm looking for some opinions on how to set up a nice tight archiso profile, that includes some files in the airootfs folder that will change quite frequently. It's actually a bash script I wrote as well as some custom systemd units. I would essentially like to maintain these files separately from the archiso profile folder structure because the idea is they aren't necessarily archiso specific and will be

[23:59:29] <thurstylark> Ghosthree3: don't have experience with it, but the docs agree with you :P
[23:59:42] <hwrd> Namarrgon I removed nvidia, but I guess nvidia-utils is a separate package.
[23:59:59] <Namarrgon> yes, it is. remove it and rebuild the initramfs again.
