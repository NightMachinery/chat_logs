[01:53:28] <ttys000> yay unbanned by microsoft
[01:53:32] <ttys000> only took 4 weeks
[01:54:02] <tuxick> wow
[01:54:08] <tuxick> that's quick indeed
[01:54:32] <tuxick> did you have to phone the nice Indian guy called Jack?
[01:54:59] <Khepra> well in my experience, the delisting with outlook is automated, fast, and straightforward. I never had to wait for more than few days.
[01:55:29] <tuxick> my experiences go back a few years
[01:55:40] <tuxick> when we were sending out weekly mass mailings
[01:55:45] <tuxick> 50+k
[01:55:51] <Khepra> so you _were_ spamming :
[01:55:54] <tuxick> no
[01:55:58] <tuxick> opt-in
[01:56:09] <tuxick> but the real problem was users forwarding
[01:56:18] <Khepra> you mean the default checked checkbox nobody reads the label on? :))
[01:56:25] <tuxick> so i learned to split !
[01:56:39] *** Quits: zap (~zap@gateway/tor-sasl/zap) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[01:56:46] <Khepra> Mate, I have unchecked checkboxes you ahve to actually move the mouse for and click. People still complain and mark your stuff as spam
[01:56:59] <tuxick> yes
[01:57:14] <tuxick> problem is i understand that people don't trust unsubcribe links
[01:57:16] <Khepra> It's a popup with checkbox, even, and you can't progress until you've scrolled down to it and clicked the large font labeled "I agree"
[01:57:42] <ttys000> We had to have our ISP (linode) request the delisting on our behalf because micrsoft stopped replying to our emails.
[01:57:56] <tuxick> heh been there :)
[01:57:56] <ttys000> microsoft had blocked entire linode subnets, so the problem was bigger than just us.
[01:58:16] <Khepra> tuxick: well, we _do_ teach them to not click suspicious ones.  for example I really hate that gandi.net sends registrant verification email from domainnameverification dot com which is very often a guest on various RBLs
[01:59:08] <Khepra> so I have to repeatedly tell them "It's okay, it's our link, it's the ONLY exception where something from us is clickable like that, don't click ANYTHING else, that's pretending to be from us".   Yeah, that doesn't work.
[02:00:23] <tuxick> kinda confusing :)
[02:00:32] <Khepra> totally confusing.

[23:33:44] <ttys000> guys, i'm confused about DKIM and could use some advice. i have a mail server at mail.mydomain.com and i have DKIM configured for this domain. I have sent tests and works and gets a pass in gmail's "show headers" etc.

[23:34:02] <ttys000> i use this same mail server for sending email from other domains as well not just from mydomain.com but also lets say company_two.com
[23:34:25] <ttys000> when i send email from company_two.com it also get's a DKIM pass in gmail's show headers. 
[23:34:30] <jaybe> use example.com for domain examples please and thank you
[23:34:52] <ttys000> even though i never put a DKIM dns record on that domain.
[23:35:25] <ttys000> actually what gmail says is DKIM:	'PASS' with domain mydomain.com 
[23:35:44] <jaybe> since you're ignoring the people you're asking for help, i'm leaving. &
[23:35:45] <ttys000> (sorry i can't switch to example.com here it's like mid \ question nd it makes it more confusing)
[23:35:56] <ttys000> ok let me redefine everything.
[23:36:06] <ttys000> my mail server is at mail.example.com 
[23:36:31] <ttys000> with this server, i send mail for multiple companies, example.com, example2.com, etc.
[23:36:55] <ttys000> i have a dkim dns record set on example.com 
[23:37:05] <jaybe> earlier you said www, but ok
[23:37:17] <jaybe> glad we're revisiting, eh
[23:37:20] <jaybe> keep going
[23:37:22] <ttys000> what
[23:37:27] * jaybe cringes
[23:37:33] <ttys000> where did i talk about www?
[23:38:10] <ttys000> anyway. 
[23:38:37] <ttys000> my question is: should i be defining DKIM records for each sending domain?
[23:39:00] <ttys000> or is it appropriate that they rely on the DKIM record of the mail server's domain?
[23:39:44] <jaybe> yes
[23:39:48] <jaybe> !dkim
[23:39:50] <dig-dug> jaybe: dkim: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is a method for email authentication that allows an organization to take responsibility for a message in a way that can be validated by a recipient. this is typically implemented by means of a milter such as !opendkim. alternatively, existing content filters (e.g. !amavisd-new) may also have their own implementation mechanism.
[23:40:35] <ttys000> sorry, yes to which question.
[23:40:47] * jaybe #unchecked #unverified #shrug #as-is ~ https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/
[23:41:01] <jaybe> the one you asked, leading with, "... my question is... "
[23:41:39] <ttys000> ok. so i need to then figure out how to add other keys to amavisd because amavisd-new showkeys only has my main domain.
