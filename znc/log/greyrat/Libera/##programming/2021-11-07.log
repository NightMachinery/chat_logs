[00:00:03] <user51> GeDaMo: took me a while to process that. yeah, list of lists. which feels like it could map quite nicely to a multidimensional array. but now that i think about it, maybe 'grid' is a better word.
[00:00:21] <Decker> for stacks/queues I use them for indexing the oppoosite end.  In native C, I've used them to work around needing to return a pointer to a thing that's expecting data at a place, but it's in an array, and the code managing those arrays uses element -1, -2 as extra data... always return arr+2 for user level code
[00:00:29] <GeDaMo> flakland: it's just a shorthand for length-index

[00:01:20] <Decker> but that's certainly hacky, and other solutions could have solved that
[00:01:57] <Decker> VB wide character strings could almost be treated as -1 element of the data is the length of the string

[00:56:06] <Inst> it's supposed to issue a call to an API
[00:56:18] <[itchyjunk]> maybe you'll figure out the for the death of you!
[00:56:49] <LiaoTao> I understand, but I meant after you've done the quiz
[00:57:14] <Inst> to a windows api, it's supposed to call windows's file opener / saver
[00:57:20] <Inst> and then return a string with the attached file name
[00:57:26] <Inst> and path
[00:57:43] <Inst> but it's so short, and the windows API calls i've seen are ridiculously baroque
[00:57:56] <Inst> from what I know of C / C++ it definitely can't actually do anything
[00:57:59] <LiaoTao> [itchyjunk], The reason for not using it is simple. You cannot easily replace it and it makes code inherently untestable. I am currently working on a codebase with 3 singletons and it will never recover.
[00:58:30] <[itchyjunk]> why is it untestable?
[00:59:24] <LiaoTao> Because you cannot modify what the code that uses it is referring to without modifying the singleton itself.
[00:59:42] <Inst> poor you
[00:59:46] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[00:59:58] <Inst> you can't get the singletons out?
[01:03:00] <Bou> Inst: a simple file dialog shouldn't be too much code
[01:03:14] <LiaoTao> [itchyjunk], That is to say, there is not interface which abstracts away functionality. You either use the object or you don't. One solution, in the case where you cannot simply use dependency injection, is to use a locator singleton that provides the concrete instances.

[01:32:09] <Decker> sure somewhat
[01:32:11] <flakland> websockets are not a socket API, it's just an upgraded http session
[01:32:17] <Decker> although there's a backbone for it already
[01:32:58] <Decker> flakland they provide server and client side connections - other than not having multicast/broadcast capability they have all the resiliance you'd want
[01:33:12] <Decker> yes, you could argue that it should be packet API, but really the state of the world is far from that
[01:33:19] <flakland> no i don't want any of it
[01:33:30] <flakland> and they force you to encyrypt
[01:34:15] <Decker> there's nothing requriing encryption
[01:34:37] <Decker> well no webvr/xr they're trying to force encryption
[01:34:50] <flakland> on a scale from 0->9 how sure are you
[01:34:53] <Decker> they think people can hijack your VR inputs and send you spinning
[01:35:06] <flakland> because i've implemented WS server and i'm almost certain i had to implement encryption
[01:35:24] <Decker> I dunno I do a lot of testing localhost- but when depoloyed to the fireld, http works just fine for everything

[03:27:04] <sonny> Being able to make a bot that can interact with the website, e.g. buying items on amazon
[03:27:43] <yitz> Websites are just HTTP requests. You can send HTTP requests from code
[03:28:06] <sonny> good point
[03:28:21] <[itchyjunk]> if a website had forms that you fill to do stuff and the server provides no api
[03:28:24] <yitz> There's various libraries designed for that

[03:28:47] <spynxic> What's the best way to wait for something to happen
[03:28:55] <sonny> the website of interest has forms but I think they are borked
[03:28:58] <yitz> spynxic: with a good book
[03:29:01] <[itchyjunk]> best way is to be patient
[03:29:15] <sonny> timer?
[03:29:22] <spynxic> Like..pausing code until a condition is satisfy without locking the whole environment
[03:29:25] <[itchyjunk]> timer times events
[03:29:34] <spynxic> Satisfied*
[03:29:36] <[itchyjunk]> how do sockets wait for connection?
[03:29:47] <sonny> good question
[03:29:48] <[itchyjunk]> they just thread into themselves and wait?
[03:29:49] <yitz> You bind to a port
[03:30:06] <yitz> There's async and threads and processes
[03:30:17] *** Quits: Akuli (~Akuli@82-203-166-207.bb.dnainternet.fi) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:30:23] <sonny> so sockets just use threads?
[03:30:30] <sonny> makes sense
[03:30:31] <yitz> No
[03:30:33] <sonny> oh
[03:30:38] <yitz> Those are orthoganol concepts
[03:30:40] <Decker> [itchyjunk] see WSAAsyncEvent , WSAWaitMultipleEvents(windos), and epoll(linux) and kevent (mac)
[03:30:50] *** Quits: zaher_ (~zaher@188.229.194.164) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[03:30:53] <yitz> Sockets can be synchronous. Or async. Or use threads or procs.
[03:30:59] <Decker> you can use a thread to wait on sockets
[03:31:08] <Decker> sockets don't themselves have threads (except on windows)
[03:31:25] <sonny> what was that thing about a connection making a thread?
[03:31:29] <sonny> c10k?
[03:31:47] <Decker> a thread per connection is kinda overkill... 
[03:32:16] <sonny> yeah, that was the problem if I remember correctly
[03:32:28] <[itchyjunk]> so the answer is too complicated
[03:32:29] <Decker> apache forked a whole process for every connection
[03:32:35] <sonny> oof
[03:32:42] <Decker> good way to bring down a server for i:50000 connect; 
[03:32:51] <sonny> lol
[03:33:02] <yitz> Doesn't Apache spin up worker processes at startup and hand out work to them?
[03:33:03] <Decker> didn't even have to ask it for anything :)
[03:33:13] <Decker> I think it's improved
[03:33:19] <yitz> Async is the future
[03:33:27] <sonny> what is async?
[03:33:39] <Decker> :) a lot of things
[03:33:44] <Decker> but short for ascynrhonous
[03:33:45] <yitz> lol. Yes
[03:33:49] <Decker> that is without a common clock
[03:34:00] <Decker> a-syn-chron-ous
[03:34:02] <sonny> the await thing that seems to be popular in a few languages?
[03:34:07] <yitz> https://www.baeldung.com/cs/async-vs-multi-threading
[03:34:08] *** Joins: zaher_ (~zaher@37.48.151.51)
[03:34:08] <sonny> async/await ?
[03:34:32] <Decker> that's async in a JS context
[03:34:42] <yitz> Python uses async/await, yes. But that's language specific. It's also a general concept/approach
[03:34:44] <Decker> it's not very async :) and await never does
[03:34:49] *** Quits: rvgate (~rvgate@user/rvgate) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:34:50] <Decker> await is more like 'resolve a promsie to a value'
[03:35:13] <sonny> so async == courotines ?
[03:35:20] <Decker> that's it in Go
[03:35:23] *** Joins: rvgate (~rvgate@user/rvgate)
[03:35:23] <sonny> ah
[03:35:35] <yitz> Go uses coroutines, yes. But that's language specific. It's also a general concept/approach
[03:35:50] <sonny> what's old is new again :-)
[03:36:17] <Decker> coroutines I see more as a forward async... where it's one to many rather than a wait for many to one
[03:36:43] <Decker> like I have this work, do it... rather than 'when you get work tell me'
[03:37:07] *** Quits: zaher__ (~zaher@37.48.182.136) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:37:23] <[itchyjunk]> Every topic is too information dense
[03:37:29] <[itchyjunk]> my poor head
[03:37:32] <Decker> but Promises are cool
[03:37:41] <sonny> how does a promise work?
[03:37:42] <Decker> and promise chains...
[03:37:51] <Decker> it's a pair of callbacks sorta
[03:37:59] <Decker> a resolve and reject
[03:38:25] <Decker> but when you get a promsie you just say .then( (resolved_value)=> {/* okay got that back */ } );
[03:38:40] <sonny> linear types seems increasingly revelant 
[03:38:51] <Decker> which await turns into a sort of inline callback that does a return (resolve_value) to the variable 
[03:39:08] <sonny> ok
[03:39:09] <Decker> like const result = await promise;
[03:39:28] <Decker> linear?
[03:39:35] <sonny> async part has to go first right?
[03:40:01] <Decker> well technically the async part runs last
[03:40:11] <Decker> because all the callbacks passed to the .then() are scheduled and ready
[03:40:21] <Decker> so when the event happens, just those funtions have to be run
[03:40:23] <sonny> linear -- vaguely, when you need one of something
[03:41:14] *** Quits: INeedAHandle (~INeedAHan@39.124.72.106) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:41:15] <sonny> ah, so it still makes use of the event loop / stack in js
[03:41:15] <Decker> but the .thens ends up forking... because you can do a map an array passing to async functions which all schedule the processing for when that element is avaiaable
[03:41:34] <Decker> ya JS's nature is to basically fall off the excecution stack into an event dispatch

[03:42:08] <Decker> so in this case part of the Promise-got-resolved logic is in the idle of the event dispatch

[03:43:49] <Decker> ya coroutines are less opaque maybe :)
[03:43:54] <sonny> fair enough
[03:44:44] <Decker> I don't have a good picture of a short example :) 
[03:45:50] <Decker> so I have this login service, which services can use. a service (like flatland game server) comes up and connects that it wants to provide a service(s) (with a configuration in json-like files), and that whole connection/negotiate for permission to be a service
[03:46:07] <Decker> and to get user requests for it is waiting on a promise... 
[03:47:13] *** Quits: LiaoTao (~LiaoTao@gateway/tor-sasl/liaotao) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:47:17] <Decker> and eventually a user connects, creates and account, and logs in, and requests the service, which then creates that service, with default permissions (and creator assigned to that user (possibly requireing a process of authorization) ), which then repsonds to the service which resolves his promise
[03:47:29] *** Joins: LiaoTao (~LiaoTao@gateway/tor-sasl/liaotao)
[03:47:42] <Decker> and he gets his own identifier (like minutes/hours later, just sitting there waiting with a small stack of callbacks ready to run )

[03:51:12] <Decker> there's a secret node api call that's called magically by their "nan.h" and you have to call manually if you end up resolving promises in a callback during an event dispatched from a native addon
[03:51:33] <sabocat> Is it unwise to expose the primary key of an entity to the public? Should you have 2 ids, 1 for DB & 1 for API?
[03:51:36] <Decker> well in the service waiting for logins
[03:51:48] <Decker> the client too... 
[03:52:06] <sonny> sabocat: yeah that seems unwise, isn't that what the admin is for?

[03:53:30] <LiaoTao> Unless you need sequentiality or something
[03:54:18] <sonny> Decker: can an auth service be made as a library?
[03:54:22] <Decker> (so... I cut part of that) the user's request for the service is to the login server, which tells the flatland game service 'expect' (username, UID), which lets the service reply with a unique ID for the client to connect with, and an address to connec to... which gets sent to the client, the client can then connect (or really it could have already connected) but then on the reply for the request of the service gets a token to connect 
[03:54:22] <Decker> to and send to the service

[03:57:02] <Decker> ya since I'm using websockets I can send that early in a lot of ways

[05:10:22] <pulse> Why did I think it was good
[05:10:49] <khanred> different era
[05:11:11] <PlanckWalk> phpBB has been synonymous with rubbish for decades
[05:11:27] <khanred> Discourse seems good
[05:11:40] <pulse> PlanckWalk, The user experience is quite decent

[05:12:11] <pulse> Is there some other forum software that is high quality, free, and somewhat modern
[05:12:17] <pulse> (I'm actually asking, I need one :P)
[05:12:20] <khanred> pulse, Discourse
[05:12:51] <pulse> I don't even know what it is and I already hate it
[05:13:02] <khanred> cool
[05:13:28] <pulse> Seems like it's not free
[05:13:33] <PlanckWalk> From a site administrator point of view phpBB has always been a nightmare of security flaws, bizarre design limitations, breaking changes, and so on.
[05:13:38] <khanred> It's open source

[05:22:22] <corecode> hi
[05:22:25] <pulse> Hi corecode 
[05:23:03] <corecode> i'm trying to implement noise functions, and i ran into an issue with noisy hue
[05:23:17] <pulse> Is it too noisy?
[05:23:20] <corecode> because hue is a field
[05:23:38] <pulse> Isn't hue usually for color
[05:23:42] <corecode> yes
[05:23:45] <corecode> linear interpolation over a field is different than over linear values
[05:24:13] <corecode> i was wondering if anybody had experience with that type of random noise
[05:24:14] <InPhase> corecode: hue is an angle.
[05:24:25] <corecode> yes
[05:24:31] <InPhase> corecode: You can interpolate linearly or circularly in the complex plane.
[05:25:16] <corecode> it feels like interpolation is the wrong move
[05:25:33] <InPhase> corecode: Might be.  Depends on what your x of your xy problem is.  :)
[05:25:45] <corecode> so i've implemented value noise
[05:25:58] <corecode> but it feels like i should be doing something with a gradient instead
[05:26:22] <corecode> gradient seems to apply better to hue (=angle) than using a value
[05:27:01] <corecode> i googled around a bit, but didn't find anything regarding this question
[05:27:10] <InPhase> Well what sort of noise effect are you actually looking for?  There are a lot of kinds of noise with different properties representing different phenomena.
[05:27:57] <corecode> i'm just playing around
[05:28:09] <corecode> so i can't answer this question
[05:28:28] <corecode> it's just clear that value noise naively applied to hue doesn't look good
[05:28:45] <InPhase> corecode: Might be.  Depends on what your x of your xy problem is.  :)https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Pink.noise.b.w.png

[05:28:52] <InPhase> Up arrow there.

[05:29:46] *** Quits: newpy (~newpy@206.168.231.90) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:30:41] <corecode> what about them?
[05:30:46] <InPhase> Pink noise is not applied per pixel, but instead has a certain power spectral property.  There are a variety of ways to generate it, but I'm partial to using random values in frequency space and FFT'ing back.
[05:30:59] <corecode> sure
[05:30:59] <InPhase> It has a nice property of size scale invariance to the noise.
[05:31:09] <arahael> FFT's are awesome.
[05:31:13] <corecode> right, let's stick with that for a moment
[05:31:30] <corecode> the naive way of mapping this value channel to hue makes it look odd
[05:31:31] <InPhase> You can also do other things like random noise, and Gaussian blur it.  Then your noise has a scale set by your blur size.
[05:32:16] *** Joins: CaCode_ (~CaCode@user/cacode)
[05:32:20] <Decker> maybe arccos( it ) ? maybe it's already linear and you want it circular?
[05:32:29] <InPhase> corecode: Well if you generated pink noise on hue, you would simply add the values to the hue angle, and convert back to RGB.
[05:33:02] <InPhase> Obviously with 0-centered pink noise so it's centered on the original image's hue.
[05:33:21] <corecode> right, if you keep a reduced hue variation
[05:33:47] <corecode> but if you want to do a full rainbow randomness, you run into the field averaging issues

[05:34:41] <Decker> you could use the random as a delta to the angle?
[05:34:42] <InPhase> You don't average on angle for that, you average the real and imaginary components of the hue vectors.
[05:35:11] *** Quits: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[05:36:13] <corecode> and that's it?
[05:37:15] <InPhase> I had a whole chapter in my thesis based largely on averaging phase angles that way (for another purpose).  It works.  :)
[05:37:39] <corecode> sure, but will that lead to a visually pleasing effect
[05:37:46] *** Quits: elkalamar_ (elkalamar@gateway/vpn/airvpn/elkalamar) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:38:00] <InPhase> I can't promise noise will be pleasing, but it will be a smoothed hue result.
[05:38:06] <corecode> in my current test implementation, i linearly interpolate over 4 corners
[05:38:50] <InPhase> There's a slight non-linearity in hue from that method if you are doing a large distance gradients.  That's slightly different.
[05:38:59] <InPhase> s/a large/large/
[05:39:22] <corecode> can you explain more?
[05:39:35] *** Quits: NEYi (~NEYi@109.251.216.38) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:41:02] <InPhase> Well if you go from 0 degrees to 90 degrees by combining them with different weights in the complex plane, you don't trace out a circle, but instead the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle from those two vector ends.
[05:41:31] <InPhase> So the angles while walking along that do not evenly go from 0 to 90 in the weighted vector approach.

[05:44:59] <InPhase> You can do an angular walk by either just some conditional checks to correct for looping, or you can use some elegant e^(i*hue) math to give you a complex iterator that you can apply to the vectors to walk along.  Implementer's choice of preferred poison on that one.

[05:50:25] <InPhase> corecode: d = e^(i*hueB)/e^(i*hueA) gives d = e^(i*(hueB-hueA)) with circularity automatically managed, for example.  Then 0.3*d is a rotation 0.3 of the way between them, meaning 0.3*d*e^(i*hueA) is 0.3 from hueA toward hueB, circularly.
[05:50:54] <InPhase> Decker: Well Python happens to be extremely elegant for this.

[05:51:46] <corecode> elegant to express, slow to compute
[05:52:17] <Decker> looks like a subtraction to me
[05:52:19] <Decker> when simplified
[05:52:42] <InPhase> It is.  It's just that wrapping it up in the trig functions means circularity is abstracted into it.
[05:53:36] <InPhase> But yes, that's not the fastest approach for said problem.  It's just mathematically clean.  You can morph the same logic into rotation matrices as well, which are doing exactly the same operations.
[05:54:34] <InPhase> This doesn't gain you much over just doing math on the angle if you only need angle.  Where it's handy is if you're varying other values like saturation or brightness at the same time.

[06:17:32] <swtester> My impression is negative because of changes in UI/UX. It loooks more like Apple which is positive. However, in File Explorer if you want to cut a file and paste it elsewhere, you have to do an extra mouse click to show more options and then it switches into an ugly UI that looks like Windows 7, and then the highlight of an active menu item has a height that is too low, and the icon is oversized, as if you were supposed to 
[06:17:32] <swtester> memorize the icons. The icons change in every version of Windows, though, so there is no point memorizing icons.

[06:28:04] <swtester> it requires TPM 2.0 to install. That is a big issue if your motherboard doesn't have TPM 2.0
[06:28:42] <leduyquang753> My laptop is 11 years old but I can still jump through hoops to upgrade if I want to. It's just not worth trying.
[06:29:12] <swtester> btw. the Apple-like look is likely to convert Apple users into Windows users (they will sell their Apple and buy a cheap laptop with Apple-like looking windows on it)
[06:30:39] <swtester> leduyquang753 my laptop was Lenovo W530 with an Intel Core i7 Extreme CPU. The CPU is as fast as modern CPUs in Lenovo laptops today. The CPU is 3920XM.

[06:36:00] <swtester> your system in practice is only as fast as the bus, so a great CPU can be still good for nothing if the fastest disk you can use is SATA, and you can't use NVMe M.2. It means when you're compiling your code, regardless of a super fast CPU, it'll be slow due to a slow bus.
[06:36:35] <swtester> speaking of laptops, I'm considering selling my laptop and keeping only the desktop

[06:42:01] <swtester> AI (supervised ML) is just a bunch of stupid math that makes a random decision and then verifies if it was correct, and then calibrates itself. So, it ends up with internal variables that represent the self-adjustments after running enough samples through it.

[08:49:13] <InPhase> swtester: I have observed that most people with incorrect opinions simply started out with an inadequate training set.  Sometimes their training set was just too small, or sometimes it had a systematic bias causing overfitting and misplaced confidence in the conclusion.

[08:57:25] <InPhase> Or, of the likely outcome of something.
[08:57:33] <swtester> InPhase no, expert opinion is nothing. It's useless. A hypothesis is <look above at what it is> and a hypothesis is not an opinion
[08:58:54] <InPhase> swtester: If you run experiments on statements just because they exist, you will never learn anything.  The space of possible statements is infinite, and the quantity of experiments that can be run very finite.  They absolutely MUST be selected and weighted by expert judgment.
[08:58:55] <swtester> when I design/execute experiments, I may have hunderds of various opinions on various things, and they are nothing. I stick to my hypothesis (things I need to test) and see which hypotheses, if any, prove to be valid

[09:04:03] <InPhase> You are not answering the question.  :)
[09:04:48] <swtester> In research design, you are trying to answer some questions by choosing your data collection strategy and data analysis strategy. Your data collection strategy includes determining what data/information you need and how you will access that data. So, depending on your research question(s) your theses to prove/disprove should be derived as research objectives.
[09:05:06] <beaky> yes its too simplistic to understand hypotheses as if they are formed without expert opinion being involved

[09:12:37] <InPhase> swtester: My most recent day of work, Friday, concluded with a meeting with someone who works under me, where I generated multiple hypotheses regarding the results of a diverse set of possible new experimental designs.  I probably generated 20-30 hypotheses, and weighted them in likelihood of correctness, using that to select out which experiments were most likely to be worth devoting hundreds of 
[09:12:43] <InPhase> thousands of dollars worth of time to.
[09:13:35] <swtester> InPhase that is a design of a solution for some problem, where you've used past experience as a heuristic to eliminate some design options
[09:13:51] <InPhase> swtester: Exactly, because that's how it's done.
[09:14:18] <swtester> design of a solution to a problem is not necessarily research and design options are not necessarily hypotheses
[09:14:30] <swtester> it is most often an ordinary design

[09:15:30] <swtester> and those experiemnts, don't they solve any problems?
[09:16:10] <swtester> weren't you doing an ordinary design, possibly a PoC of something, or a feasibility study of something?
[09:16:31] <InPhase> swtester: Not really directly.  I was generating hypotheses about probable oscillatory patterns in the brain in response to certain situations that we would put participants under.
[09:16:35] <swtester> if not, what have you innovated that wasn't known by anyone in the world before?

This is, literally, what I was doing.  And that's because this is what is always done when making a reasonable hypothesis in an area worth studying.
[09:25:25] <swtester> no, you need to look up the term hypothesis. 
[09:25:45] <swtester> and the term thesis
[09:25:56] <InPhase> I looked those up before teaching them to my students over many years.  :)
[09:26:09] <swtester> thesis is key to understand = a proposition stated or put forward for consideration, especially one to be discussed and proved or to be maintained against objections:
[09:26:13] <InPhase> I even have lecture notes summarizing these terms and their role in science.
[09:26:29] <swtester> hypothesis also - a proposition, or set of propositions, set forth as an explanation for the occurrence of some specified group of phenomena, either asserted merely as a provisional conjecture to guide investigation (working hypothesis ) or accepted as highly probable in the light of established facts.

[09:28:53] <swtester> An opinion is a statement describing a personal belief or thought that cannot be tested (or has not been tested) and is unsupported by evidence. A hypothesis is usually a prediction based on some observation or evidence. Hypotheses must be testable, and once tested, they can be supported by evidence. If a statement is made that cannot be tested and disproved, then it is not a hypothesis. Sometimes it is possible to restate 
[09:28:53] <swtester> an opinion so that it can become a hypothesis.

[09:32:33] <InPhase> swtester: Your "interpretation" is a contradiction.  You declared an opinion is "unsupported by evidence".

[10:00:08] <arahael> swtester: Now you're changing the discussion quite a bit.  Now you're saying 'a hypothesis is not an opinion', I don't think that was quite the discussion you were having earlier - earlier weren't you saying 'opinions don't matter and opinions are incompatible with science'?

[10:01:04] <swtester> I said a hypothesis is not an opinion the whole time.

[10:02:12] <swtester> opinion is neither scientific nor science
[10:02:34] <leduyquang753> Well that's your opinion. :)
[10:02:35] <InPhase> swtester: Well the entire field of science seems to disagree with you, as you will see at google scholar.  :)
[10:02:57] <swtester> no, that's not an opinion, leduyquang753. Study research methods and learn the scientific theory.
[10:03:08] <leduyquang753> Back it up, then.
[10:03:19] <leduyquang753> The burden of proof is on you.
[10:03:20] <swtester> InPhase no, quite on the contrary, you and your misinterpretations disagree with the entire field of science
[10:03:30] <InPhase> swtester: Did you visit google scholar yet?
[10:03:40] <swtester> I've sent you courses and training and you have not even watched
[10:03:52] <InPhase> swtester: I look forward to your explanation of the literature being full of what you say is not part of it.
[10:04:02] <arahael> "watched".  Man... education these days...
[10:04:08] <swtester> so, the burden is on you to take the training and then learn and then finally understand that opinions are pseudoscience
[10:04:27] <arahael> psuedoscience is something else entirely.
[10:04:30] <swtester> your education sucks so that's why I have posted you a course with videos
[10:04:39] <leduyquang753> Another opinion. :)
[10:04:47] <swtester> those of us who have a good education have taken classes on the subject at postgraduate level
[10:04:53] <InPhase> swtester: Did you visit google scholar yet?
[10:04:58] <leduyquang753> You are kinda resorting to personal attack now.
[10:05:14] <arahael> leduyquang753: I'm inclined to agree.
[10:05:22] <swtester> no, you are kind of interpreting your unwillingness to watch the study courses as a personal attack
[10:05:37] <swtester> simply give it a thought
[10:05:44] <swtester> consider watching for a few minutes

[10:07:40] <InPhase> swtester: That study.com video is for a high school biology sequence.

[14:01:58] <CaCode> Enterprise-grade describes products that integrate into an infrastructure with a minimum of complexity and offer transparent proxy support.
[14:03:05] <pyzozord> it's a marketing term trying to monkey off of "military-grade". As far as I heard "military-grade" is actually a synonym for "lowest-bidder"

[14:28:18] <Atque> CaCode: That's true for the perfect world. The markets for administrative and technical experience can be rough though. You want a CFO who knows about IT, but that'll probably cost you more than one who just knows about accounting.

[14:31:13] <CaCode> Maybe universities or schools could offer courses "IT for busines" where people learn only those parts they need in a non-IT company
[14:31:35] <Atque> arahael: Yeah, in general, development and project management have a tension I think. Many coders want to deliver the technically best solutions. Project management aims for a deadline. There's probably compliance, finance, market etc. reasons for that. Many developers probably say if they had four months more, the product would be more amazing.

[14:32:57] <arahael> Atque: Agree with that, though I'll caution that with that the way to resolve that tension is to allow it to be used for advise, rather than avoid getting that advice in the first place.

[14:34:49] <deniska> I am slightly more familiar with bitrix, which is a PHP based CMS. It's like wordpress, but somehow even worse. It costs money and comes with in a box with a product key

[14:37:00] <arahael> Atque: I have another tension, though: Implementing a solution yourself, in code, very simplistically, vs finding an off-the-shelf solution that also does the same thing but requires a lot more upfront investment.
[14:37:31] <arahael> Atque: There are huge advantages for the latter - but I fear we've gone too far in that direction these days in most enterprises.

[14:42:33] <Atque> arahael: I am also not a fan of "cloud first" procurement policies. Both are pretty arbitrary I suspect. It's better to assess pros and cons for each option.

[14:43:21] *** Joins: nshire_ (~Neal@47.146.41.156)
[14:43:26] <deniska> it's cheaper than real hardware on low end
[14:43:37] <Atque> deniska: Yeah, and switching costs are high and integrations between 123 cloud providers can be a pain.
[14:43:57] <deniska> Which makes sense, developers pay for low end products, and enterprises end up paying for high end :)
[14:44:31] <deniska> Atque: oh, I also have a strong aversion to cloud specific services
[14:44:35] <arahael> Atque: There's an advantage to going with 'cloud first' - it can simplify future procurements.  It's a bit nuts, though.
[14:45:15] <arahael> Atque: Eg, consider raising a request for a new server, or... Just spinning one up when you damn well want.

[16:31:55] <TJ-> Donitz: generally no it won't lose capacity if you're relying on the device's internal remapping, but if you manually use something like badblocks from 'userspace' you can effectively reduce the usuable blocks of a file-system
[16:32:17] <TJ-> Donitz: the usual way a device capacity is reduced is if it has a Host Protected Area (HPA)
[16:32:21] <Donitz> what happens if all sectors go bad 
[16:32:35] <TJ-> Donitz: what happens? do you like toast? :P
[16:32:44] <Donitz> well, will it start using bad sectors?
[16:32:47] <Donitz> will it stop working?
[16:33:21] <TJ-> it'll stop working ... 'bad sectors' means the device cannot get read/write data that matches the CRCs of the sectors
[16:33:26] *** Quits: elkalamar (elkalamar@gateway/vpn/airvpn/elkalamar) (Client Quit)
[16:33:44] <deniska> once disk starts having enough bad sectors for you to notice, it's typically a runaway process
[16:33:52] <deniska> so it'll just be dead soon
[16:33:56] <TJ-> when sectors start going bad the device may not know it until it tries to read them some time later
[16:33:59] <Donitz> does a disk list bad sectors somewhere
[16:34:33] <Donitz> so you can tell how many have actually been detected
[16:34:44] <TJ-> Donitz: no, that's an internal map. The best you can do see is the pending/reallocated sector counts via SMART
[16:34:51] <Donitz> ah
[16:34:55] <Donitz> let me check smart
[16:35:30] <TJ-> Donitz: most devices these days don't use physical addressing, they maintain a map so your LBA 0 might actually be 1/2 way into the device :)

[17:01:53] <Nselm> amigojapan I disagree. Some of the smartest people I know use windows. Its just that they have priorities other than Computers and if that is the case, windows just wins because of simplicity and the number of applications it offers.
[17:02:38] <[itchyjunk]> This hasn't been true for a while now.
[17:02:53] <[itchyjunk]> Linux is both simpler and has application on par if not more than windows.
[17:03:01] <Nselm> You mean that linux has made a lot of progress in simplicity and user interface?
[17:03:04] <Nselm> yeah
[17:03:17] <Nselm> I see what you mean. Still its easier to use Windows
[17:03:24] <[itchyjunk]> It's not, really.
[17:03:36] <[itchyjunk]> It's easier to use a linux software manager to install new applications.
[17:03:45] <[itchyjunk]> The process in windows in unclear.
[17:03:48] <[itchyjunk]> Often, risky.
[17:03:52] <deniska> People are just used to whatever they are used
[17:03:59] <[itchyjunk]> Everything you want on linux is a click away.
[17:04:01] <Nselm> Your company uses windows, your neigbour uses windows... Most people grow up using windows
[17:04:03] <deniska> It often happens to be windows because it's preinstalled
[17:04:08] <[itchyjunk]> yes, people are just used to windows.
[17:04:08] <deniska> Learning new things takes effort
[17:04:10] <Nselm> Many even dont know there is anything else but windows
[17:04:20] <[itchyjunk]> New people find linux easier to get a handle of.
[17:04:20] <deniska> Most people use iPads anyway :P
[17:04:49] <[itchyjunk]> i introduced ubuntu to a bunch of kids as experiment and ubuntu was definately more intuitive to them compared to windows 10 home edition
[17:04:53] <[itchyjunk]> 8-11 year olds.
[17:05:17] <deniska> if you are not used to computers at all, linux is… mostly fine
[17:05:21] <[itchyjunk]> i asked them to install random shit like vlc, screenshot capturer etc
[17:05:32] <[itchyjunk]> which had free things available for both windows and linux

[17:06:25] <leduyquang753> I'm not mentioning Microsoft store.
[17:06:27] <[itchyjunk]> for example, vlc wasn't avaliable with the simple search function they had

[19:25:19] <pyzozord> I'm not sure how this works, but doesn't larger cache, more cores etc still makes the chip hotter? Meaning it's still transistors that work together very closely
[19:25:49] <mrig> It is my belief that the clock speed was blocked by the heat, but I could well be wrong.
[19:26:37] <mrig> smaller could mean lower energy requirements and less heat too I suppose.
[19:26:45] <pyzozord> I think so too, we started going "wide" because of heat, so I suppose larger cache / more cores is not affect as much by the heat problem as higher frequency cpus
[19:27:32] <pyzozord> well, that means only more parallelism and more vectorisation

[22:02:48] <dTal> coding is what hip youngsters do when they make their so-called "apps"
[22:02:50] <horribleprogram> cuz technically even writing x64 is "coding" 
[22:02:54] <CalimeroTeknik> or if you will, converting algorithms to code
[22:03:11] <CalimeroTeknik> but to code an algorithm you need a paradigm also

[22:03:25] <horribleprogram> the kernel's abstractions
[22:03:26] <CalimeroTeknik> (algorithm + paradigm) →coding→ code

[22:04:45] <CalimeroTeknik> dTal, you made it clear that the difference was wearing a tie or not, to you
[22:04:58] <CalimeroTeknik> and writing COBOL without wearing a tie is a syntax error

[23:57:56] <bob518> I'm applying for SDE and wanted to learn one noSQL. Which one would be very useful MongoDB, Cassandra or something else?

[23:59:00] <pulse> I haven't kept track of the DBMS situation for quite a while
[23:59:32] <InPhase> pulse: I grabbed some example numbers.  LOC per day for small projects is 20 to 125, while for large projects 1.5 to 25.  Autocomplete feels handy, but each autocomplete saves virtually nothing on that scale, and the utility of it actually goes down with larger projects.
