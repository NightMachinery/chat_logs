[06:47:53] <jxself> And from the point of view of what country? Because international copyright issues are also complicated.

[06:50:06] <jxself> From the point of view of the United States I think we can say that some of ITS doesn't have copyright on it.
[06:50:12] <jxself> Based on https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain
[06:50:27] <jxself> Given the lack of copyright notices from back then.
[06:50:36] <jxself> Since there was no security and anyone could go access any part of it over the ARPANET I'm associating "publication" with ITS and modifications being installed on the computers at MIT. But I am not a laywer.
[06:51:18] <jxself> But in 1999, MIT did release parts of ITS under GPLv2-or-later: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/its/
[06:52:00] <jxself> But was there any copyright on those pieces to be had if, per that chart, it was "In the public domain due to failure to comply with required formalities"
[06:52:34] <jxself> I don't know that's a question that necessarily needs to be answered, especially if one is following the GPL for those pieces.
[06:52:43] <jxself> But that's not all of ITS in that URL there.
[06:53:16] *** Joins: sledge_77 (~AdminUser@200116b845a09000799a480ec0c74618.dip.versatel-1u1.de)
[06:53:49] <jxself> My understanding is there are still pieces being obtained from backup tapes at MIT. Pieces that were not officially "released" via that URL. So I go back to that chart from Cornell again and look at the facts for the different pieces.
[06:55:37] <jxself> Also, I've seem some things like INQUIR (part of ITS) has a non-commercial license on it. But I'm also told that INQUIR originally didn't have a copyright notice on it so this may be invalid and it may be properly public domain but you'd need a copyright attorney to argue that.
[06:56:52] <jxself> Also, I understand that some of the source code is missing. Or at least, is yet to be found. So some of the recovered programs exist only in binary form. At least until/unless the source code is found and/or they get decompiled back to assembly. Because ITS was written in assembly language.
[06:57:08] <jxself> I seem to recall there being a GitHub issue on the topic for which programs were missing source code.
[06:57:32] <jxself> Does that raise the issue from https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html that "Access to the source code is a precondition"
[06:57:36] <jxself> ???

[07:00:02] <jxself> Then there are even more questions, like of the modifications that people are making today. Like: Those working on resurrecting ITS are also adding in other things from that time, like ZORK. What is the copyright status of that? But the ITS, as you download it from GitHub, provides all of this and more.
[07:01:04] <jxself> As you can see I've been looking in to this myself, from a U.S. point of view. The answers could be different for other countries, like those that don't follow the rule of the shorter term.

[07:04:04] <tpefreedom> Well, LiLo, openrc, linux-libre, and MBR partition tables all work well on my "new" (refurbished) laptop.
[07:04:15] <jxself> That's good.
[07:04:30] <jxself> ITS won't run on your laptop. :)
[07:04:39] <jxself> Well, not directly :)
[07:05:24] <tpefreedom> I've had soome issues installing parabola (not trisquel though).
[07:07:05] <tpefreedom> I thought that maybe openrc didn't work well on my laptop or that my bios had problems working with mbr partition tables, but I tried devuan with lilo and both things worked just fine. (afaik lilo only supports mbr, not gpt.)

[07:53:03] <tpefreedom> Then it wouldn't work with openrc, sysvinit, runit, etc?
[07:55:25] <joepublic> There are plenty of parts of systemd that work with other init systems, but to what end?
[07:56:01] <jxself> Yes. Module doesn't mean "interchangeable with stuff from someone else." That's a different issue.
[07:56:07] <jxself> er Modular doesn't...
[07:57:39] <seachala[m]> joepublic: I'm curious about this question. Why OpenRC? Why Shepherd? Devuan supports a handful of different init programs, so how might one choose?

[08:01:14] <jxself> I imagine you'll find people's reasons for using programs to be numerous and varied.
[08:01:30] <jxself> Sort like asking why Emacs? Why Vim? Why Postfix? Why Exim? Why GNOME? Why KDE? Why MATE? Why Cinnamon? Why CDE? Why...
[08:01:38] <joepublic> I use systemd because it comes preconfigured with debian.
[08:03:28] <jxself> I use it because Trisquel has it too. And as long as I can press the power button and get to the login screen then (IMHO) the init system has done its job and I cam begin working on things that I need to work on.
[08:03:51] <seachala[m]> A lot of people seem to want a choice of init, and otherwise are fine with systemd.

[13:27:41] <opal> >Why OpenRC?
[13:28:10] <opal> for a while i used openrc because it wasnt systemd (i had issues with systemd on previous installs and i have issues with it from a design standpoint)
[13:28:30] <opal> now i see that openrc sucks ass too and plan to move everything to s6
[13:28:37] <opal> services shouldnt fork to background
[13:28:45] <opal> they should be supervised
[13:29:32] <opal> good chunk of my services are already supervised by s6, i just need to convert everything to work with s6-linux-init and s6-rc
[13:29:55] <opal> execline is great for writing services
[13:30:01] <kompowiec> opal: you tried RC?
[13:30:08] <opal> rc doesnt supervise either
[13:30:12] <opal> but yes ive used openbsd's rc
[13:30:26] <kompowiec> i used RC once, on slackware
[13:30:27] <opal> and i can still use sh as opposed to execline for really complex services, so i have the freedom
[13:30:38] <opal> any rc sucks
[13:30:40] <kompowiec> it was nice but it required much effort
[13:30:44] <opal> yeah
[13:30:57] <kompowiec> (like the whole slackware at all :P)
[13:31:01] <opal> sysvinit sucks too but i hate that systemd claims *only* to compete with sysvinit
[13:31:08] <opal> even when systemd first started off, daemontools existed
[13:31:41] <kompowiec> i remember sysvinit with devuan. It was mess kinda
[13:32:01] <opal> i remember debian's sysvinit service scripts, fucking nightmare
[13:32:24] <opal> openrc has less of that boilerplate in scripts but the scripts are still normally too long
[13:32:37] <opal> and a lot of them do too much that is out of scope from service handling

[14:16:53] <kompowiec> well, if you have a lot of spammers, I don't see any other choice. And for those who don't want to litter, you share the codes
[14:17:17] <opal> i dont use rbls on my mailserver and have had few issues
[14:17:22] <kompowiec> personally, I also prefer to block as little as possible, but changing the VPN is literally a moment.
[14:17:24] <opal> the issues i do have get reported to ISPs
[14:17:30] <opal> the ISPs who dont respond, i bounce their ranges
[14:18:23] <opal> kompowiec the blog post i linked will basically answer what i have to say about online regulation
[14:18:53] <opal> tl;dr it should be on ISPs to deal with spammy customers, and law enforcement to deal with illegal content
[14:19:11] <opal> any other way and it isnt sustainable for people who want a low barrier to entry to self-host
[14:19:14] <kompowiec> i can recommended panoptykon, they really fight it very well. It is a pity that the government is stronger ...
[14:20:55] <ukine> but, opal, what about all those well paid skids?! and the fat rich making money off of QoS (anti net-neutrality)?! whatever will they do?!
[14:21:22] <opal> buy a few acres and raise corn
[14:21:55] <ukine> (they are the ones who have the ISPs as their backs for those reasons. fuck all reason and logic, let's all ride the money train etc.)
[14:22:10] <ukine> *that* is what ISPs are up to these days
[14:22:15] <kompowiec> net neutrality, you say?

[14:23:09] <ukine> it would be nice to get a microwave hookup and not have to deal with big-cable BS they've been up to recently
[14:23:13] <kompowiec> if people would use it to have free (as a beer) internet, they would quickly give up on this idea.
[14:24:01] <opal> recently ive been thinking about this a lot: i want to move probably to the northwest and start a self-sustaining community, a community isp, go off the grid where i can, all of that
[14:24:17] <opal> seems like that idea is well-received in the northwest so i should be at home
[14:24:18] <kompowiec> it's called a ham radio? ;)

[14:25:07] <Armand> ... once we move to the US, that is. :P
[14:25:22] <Armand> North-east England is just a deadzone with no jobs.

[15:12:56] <opal> are you connecting it to an upstream though
[15:13:55] <DiffieHellman> I wish - but I don't think there are any meshnets in range. I could bridge another one over the internet ofc.
[15:14:31] <opal> well i always think of meshnets as complementary to the internet
[15:14:44] <opal> also look into stuff like yggdrasil and cjdns if you havent
[15:14:56] <DiffieHellman> If you make the meshnet big enough it becomes the internet.
[15:15:42] <opal> i just mean i never had a goal to replace the internet backbone, just provide alternative routes
[15:15:54] <DiffieHellman> yggdrasil and cjdns are nice, but may as use Tor hidden services or i2p.
[15:16:13] <opal> they have different use cases altogether
[15:16:17] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[15:16:40] <DiffieHellman> Well yeah, but not really for the services I wanna host.
[15:16:41] <opal> and technically you could set up either of those anonymity layers on top of yggdrasil, have an internal network
[15:16:58] <DiffieHellman> Just bridge em all?
[15:17:20] <opal> eh? i mean you dont need to use the mainnets if you dont want to
[15:17:34] <opal> tor can be patched to use different bootstraps, i2p can be told to use whichever bootstraps you want
[15:18:28] <DiffieHellman> I was referring to offerring meshnet, yggdrasil and cjdns all at the same time. 
[15:19:09] <opal> lot of people use ygg/cjdns *for* their meshnet topologies
[15:19:36] <opal> sure theres a lot of internet peers but those can be replaced as meshnet peers become more common
[15:20:11] <DiffieHellman> B.A.T.M.A.N seems to scale decently for Wi-Fi links. 
[15:20:17] <opal> its useful if you want to completely go the democratic route and not deal with registering ASes and ip addresses with iana/icann

[21:41:00] <opal> kline were services fixed to prevent decloaking
[21:41:29] <kline> partially
[21:41:38] <kline> the window for leaking IPs is smaller

[21:42:56] <iShareFreedom> not realy kline i can do it with proxy im using Konversation 
[21:43:17] <kline> iShareFreedom, if youre not using our tor-sasl service (or a vpn), your IP isnt hidden
[21:43:21] <iShareFreedom> i dont realy know how i can connecting via tor
[21:43:34] <kline> but id recommend about commercial VPNs because they are usually non-free and tbh will sell you out if people come asking
[21:43:51] <kline> iShareFreedom, https://libera.chat/guides/connect#accessing-liberachat-via-tor
[21:44:01] <iShareFreedom> Thanks for the info dude! thanks kline
[21:44:56] <kline> iShareFreedom, its not a complicated process, but there are a few steps: 1) add Certificate-based SASL to your client and account, 2) get a tor proxy set up on your local PC, 3) plug client into proxy

[23:07:37] <seachala[m]> Well, Xubuntu 18 runs on it, but isn't supported any more. I think it can run GNU/Linux if I just fetch the old i386 drivers. It works with linux-libre kernel, including WiFi.
[23:09:59] <iShareFreedom> seachala in gnu.org/distros you can find the distributions you can use completly free software
[23:10:30] <la_mettrie> iShareFreedom: probably none of them supports 386
