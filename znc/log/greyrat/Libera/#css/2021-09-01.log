[01:13:12] <AMcBain> lantech19446, in what sense? It's already language aware. It just does the first letter of each word. However it does have the issue where it doesn't skip things like a, an, or the in English since that's sort of a style choice and requires the implementation be opinionated.
[01:14:19] <AMcBain> Though I do wish that when you select something like capitalize you can force it to lowercase everything first, since sometimes text comes through that already has caps and it results in no changes to the output.
[01:14:21] <lantech19446> that's exactly what I was thinking of when I said titling being able to know to skip a and of the is etc
[01:14:47] <AMcBain> As above that requires it to follow a style guide, and there's competing style defs on how to capitalize, iirc.
[01:14:55] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:15:01] <AMcBain> It also requires them to be aware of a lot of words to be able to do it properly since it's not just indefinite articles.
[01:15:09] <lantech19446> possibly? I only ever learned one way but that doesn't mean there aren't others
[01:15:44] <lantech19446> yea it's just a pipe dream I'm typing tons of titles right now and it would just be nice to make it simplet
[01:15:48] <lantech19446> simpler*
[01:15:50] <AMcBain> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case - AP vs Chicago.
[01:16:36] <AMcBain> In theory I thought there was some API that would let people kind of "extend" CSS via site-registered code so you could possibly use that stuff to flag a text-transform: titlecase; and do what you consider to be "the right thing."
[01:16:54] <AMcBain> Look up CSS Houdini

[01:18:36] <AMcBain> and a happy uploaded file to you, too! Do you have a question to go with those? :)
[01:18:36] <teut> atleast give 1 min to me
[01:18:59] <teut> why does part of the text gets cut when using "fixed" with navbar?
[01:20:00] <AMcBain> When you tell it to be fixed it's removed from the document flow, so everything else behaves as if it isn't there. If you want to reserve space for it at the top of the page, then you need to put a margin-top on the body or the element that is topmost visually.
[01:21:04] <teut> but header is a part of the body
[01:21:24] <teut> you mean add margin to  <main></main>?
[01:22:06] <lantech19446> AMcBain: I will thank you
[01:22:36] <teut> I think to tried to give a lot of info in few words
[01:23:25] *** Joins: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman)
[01:24:22] <teut> and with sticky the navbar hides on scrolling
[01:25:06] <teut> with sticky iif some element is in the middle of page , then it just sticks to top with scrolling
[01:25:27] <AMcBain> teut, ehhhh, no. So if you set .jss1 (just using the existing class names already on the site) to position: fixed; or some subelement of that, as you wish, you will also want to put top: 0; on that. Then you can apply margin-top: 4em; to something like #root and all will work out.
[01:25:37] <AMcBain> And yes, that's what sticky does.
[01:25:59] <AMcBain> You will also find with a fixed header you may want to apply a z-index to it, so that items on the page don't appear on top of the fixed header.
[01:26:22] <teut> thats getting complicated and dirty since I m using react and material ui
[01:26:35] <AMcBain> They should have things built in to help you with this then.
[01:26:48] <teut> ya, I will find them
[01:26:53] <teut> thanks for helping
[01:27:04] <teut> in case nothing is there then I ll use these
[01:32:58] <AMcBain> Hmm. With the layoutWorklet via Houdini, I could create a custom element that has the correct layout size after transforms are applied...
[01:33:23] <AMcBain> because the spec took the easy way out, imo, resulting in things rotated 90degrees (for example) still having the same width.
[01:36:40] <teut> Houdini?  thats used for css?
[01:36:50] <teut> thats used for movies afaik

[01:39:39] <AMcBain> You missed the start of that conversation, and yes, CSS Houdini is a set of specs and APIs to allow additions to the handling of CSS by client-side code.
[01:40:01] <AMcBain> It is currently incomplete and not implemented fully everywhere, but that's to be expected for experimental items.
[01:41:35] <AMcBain> Layout Worklets let you define position and sizing of elements, Paint Worklets let you define the contents of something in CSS that normally expects an <image> type (or url() I guess), there's a worklet for audio, and one for animations so people stop doing scroll-linked stuff that's slower.
[01:41:39] <matsaman> imagine thinking CSS needed ever more trash added to it =P
[01:41:59] <AMcBain> but it also includes definitions for custom properties so you can specify defaults, type info, and something else.
[01:42:41] <AMcBain> Your trash is someone else's treasure. ;)
[01:44:31] <matsaman> 'cause that worked so well for XHTML

[17:14:24] <undefined_bob> hassoon: whats happening is that just a few letters of the last word are moved into a second line. But I would like that the whole word move to the second line
[17:14:32] <undefined_bob> and not only some letters of it

[17:15:37] <hassoon> undefined_bob: what ? i don't get it
[17:15:45] <undefined_bob> this fiddle site doesn't seem to work for me
[17:16:36] <hassoon> nope, it's working fine
[17:16:43] <hassoon> what's wrong ?
[17:17:28] <undefined_bob> hassoon: if the word in my <a> is too long for its container, lets use the word 'undefined_bob' for example, then the letters 'ob' will be moved into a second line
[17:17:58] <hassoon> undefined_bob: that depends on the arbitrary width of the a tag
[17:18:10] <undefined_bob> but instead I would like to have the whole word 'undefined_bob' in the second line if the word is too long
[17:18:33] <undefined_bob> it also depends on the screen/resolution of the viewer
[17:19:00] <undefined_bob> got a complain that 'their is a weird single character'
[17:19:14] <undefined_bob> and then I had to figure out whats wrong
[17:20:12] <undefined_bob> hassoon: in the fiddle you sent me I cant see any code and I cant type something into the css js fields
[17:21:00] <hassoon> undefined_bob: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/393
[17:21:32] <undefined_bob> hassoon: I cant see code in there

[17:25:15] <hassoon> undefined_bob: maybe you are running some kind of prox or whatever
[17:25:40] <hassoon> the fiddle's backend address contains the string 'host'
[17:26:14] <hassoon> undefined_bob: some users before had that issue
[17:27:31] <undefined_bob> normally not, I dont know
[17:28:10] <hassoon> how come you have the fiddle's iframe rendered fine, but not the codes ?

[23:24:26] <whoever> hi all
[23:24:54] <whoever> is it possible to add scrollbars to window.alert()
[23:25:06] <whoever> so I can pass loing stringsu
[23:25:12] <whoever> strings
[23:25:55] <matsaman> just for your own personal convenience?
[23:26:15] <matsaman> have you considered console.log?
[23:26:33] <whoever> ya , i just wantet to know if it was possible
[23:27:33] <matsaman> don't think you can with alert
[23:27:34] <whoever> matsaman: thanks for anster by the way
[23:27:41] <matsaman> but you can make your own custom thing just like alert very easily
[23:27:57] <matsaman> it's just a box, over the rest of the page
[23:28:41] <whoever> ya i already have done that and since the alert is right there I thought I'd ask
