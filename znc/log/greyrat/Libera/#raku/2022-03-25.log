[01:53:35] <melezhik> I am contemplating on building ci server for Raku projects, I wonder if people are quite happy now with GH/Ado etc? I think I can build a solution that would be as close to Raku as possible with many features out of the box, but before starting anything ... I'd like if there is a niche for that ...
[01:55:09] <melezhik> so right now people would write yet another yaml file with devopsih stuff init - like git repo info , zed install and maybe something else ... I am thinking that it's possible to build a solution where people would just point a git repo and that is it, setting all options via web UI
[01:55:22] <melezhik> no yaml coding required at all
[01:56:21] <melezhik> so eventually many features could be added without necessity to change anything on users side ...
[01:57:18] <melezhik> like even now I am thinking about Â adding App::RaCoCo test coverage out of the box

[02:44:23] <drakonis> i see
[02:45:04] <guifa_> the problem is (at least doing things in browser) it takes a little bit for Rakudo to compile
[02:45:53] <guifa_> That might not be a problem on node.js though?  I haven't done anything there though to and dunno if it precompiles its modules

[04:12:27] <melezhik> also one can test coverage for this module made by App::RaCoCo
[04:13:36] <melezhik> we can think about all other features included out of the box Â by default ( not required any modifications from user side Â ) - which are actual for any typical Raku project
[04:14:20] <melezhik> even now for example it's possible to publish test coverage statistic in html format as App::RaCoCo already does that
[04:15:04] <melezhik> so modules author would just register in this CI service and point their Github, Gitlab whatever source code urls

[18:44:42] <holyghost> I mentioned 2 years ago I was building a Scheme language system to extend raku such as guile for GNU code
[18:45:22] <holyghost> I am currently at a symbol API and tables for parsing the thing with a theorem prover
[18:46:14] <holyghost> As a demo I am trying to make it into a Gameboy microcode client
[18:46:35] <holyghost> SFY, the code at https://sourceforge.net/projects/gremlin-scheme/files//
[18:47:11] <holyghost> After the theorem prover thingies are stable I can start on the racial extension to convert/translate files for it

[22:37:34] <japhb> Precompiled modules are bytecode and serialized state.
[22:38:32] <japhb> The biggest thing that people can do to speed up a Raku *script* is to move all of it into a *module*, leaving just a #! line and a use line in the script, and nothing else.  Because then the module gets precompiled, and it's much faster.
