[00:12:45] <Spawns_Carpet[m]> hello. I am wondering if anyone could help me with some elisp programming issues related to calling async subprocesses. I am trying to write a little wrapper around make-process that allows the user to provide a callback that gets called when the process exits, the callback should receive the process, the exit status and a string containing all of stdout, and from there it can decide what it wants to do with that. My issue is, I do not
[00:12:45] <Spawns_Carpet[m]> know how I can pass a symbol into a function and then later eval the symbol (other than with backtick + ,?), and I also am not sure how to call the process created by make-process to the callback itself since the sentinel doesn't have access to any binding for that

[11:01:29] <kenran> I'm having a strange issue with project-find-file: searching for 'training.' gives me two results, both with the exact match 'training' in there.

[11:10:58] <kenran> That seems to be the situations that are left where you can't really make sense of Emacs things without looking at the actual sources. If it's package-specific the first thing I often do when checking out a package is doing C-h v RET package-name- RET to glance over the variables.

[11:11:46] <kenran> But in this case this didn't show me anything that looked like "the option". But I like it even better now, as it actually seems to integrate with the built-in stuff better than, say, projectile.
[11:12:25] <piyo> kenran: what is your most useful part of projectile?
[11:13:13] <kenran> piyo: I didn't use projectile much at all, basically just "find file", "open magit", "switch project". That's why I ditched it for project.el

[11:14:25] <kenran> When I was doing clojure I remember using the testing stuff for navigation between tests and code, running tests and so on. But I'm not doing that now really. It's probably quite good, but I'm not missing it.
[11:14:35] <kenran> piyo: do you use it?
[11:14:45] <piyo> I don't think in "projects", even though I have lots of git working dirs. I am slowly trying out projectile and project.

[11:15:40] <kenran> Ah yeah, me neither usually. When I was using Doom Emacs, I tried out the perspective-mode or what it's called, where you have project-specific workspaces, but I didn't feel at home with it at all.
[11:16:11] <piyo> find file: helm-find-for-files. open magit: magit-dispatch and my registered dir function; switch project: nope.
[11:16:30] <kenran> But especially at work it's sometimes useful for me to think in projects. I like to clean up when done with things for one repo by calling project-kill-buffers

[11:17:19] <kenran> piyo: switch-project is how I quickly get to a magit-status for the different projects at work for instance
[11:17:34] <kenran> piyo: yeah, for grep I use rg, too, albeit with consult
[11:19:00] <kenran> I think projectile shines when you have a language where the default integration is great. I remember liking being able to "execute just the test I point to" or "run all tests in the current buffer"
[11:19:16] <piyo> project.el uses C-x p, which is convenient.

[11:21:19] <kenran> I feel like once I start using more builtins like dired, eshell, ..., I can benefit from project.el quite a bit, as I often have to run things "from the project root"
[11:21:27] <piyo> I have this external git command that fetches all preferred working dirs. I need to integrate it with project.el so that it has some nice defaults.

[13:36:02] <samlamamma> Emacs freezes consistently at same place in source with same edit, I think it's font-lock or the regex based highlighter (disappears w/o syntax highlighting and gdb attach tells a similar story).

[14:09:09] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpet[m]: the s library (besides an annoying name) is an add on that doesn't come with emacs; you can usually use standard emacs functions (including the relatively new 'string-' functions instead). Instead of s-lines, you could call (split-string .... "\n")

[16:27:59] <StarOnD> grym, in this case who is listening to the events?

[16:29:30] <pjb> StarOnD: not at all.
[16:29:42] <StarOnD> pjb, please clarify
[16:30:03] <pjb> StarOnD: well, you could: unset DISPLAY ; emacs -nw # so no X server could be involved at all.
[16:30:04] <grym> StarOnD: got me.  whatever the terminal's up to, i guess? i don't know these internals very well 
[16:30:22] <grym> but emacs runs fine on servers that don't even _have_ X 
[16:30:28] <pjb> StarOnD: emacs events are emacs events, not X events.
[16:30:44] <pjb> StarOnD: emacs reads the terminal keyboard and synthesize its own key events. 
[16:30:45] <grym> aiui emacs is really just a giant REPL

[16:30:57] <grym> that happens to choose to display itself as an editor, usually 
[16:31:07] <pjb> StarOnD: when you make a frame on a X server, then emacs will also get X events, and convert them into emacs key events.

[16:34:03] <pjb> StarOnD: well, you can search for event in emacs, but mostly see 20 Command Loop in elisp manual. (C-h i m elisp RET

[16:34:12] <StarOnD> it was great chatting with you @ pjb and grym

[17:57:49] <rpav> actually if it's like "i want to make sure the code is backed up" then definitely push, and use branches for projects
[17:58:03] <rpav> if it's a private repo no one else is touching it doesn't really matter if you push right away
[17:58:32] <rpav> even for shared stuff, you _could_ always have a "my immediate upstream" repo and only push to "shared" upstream when it matters
[17:58:47] <chasecaleb> Even if it's a public repo with a bunch of devs working on it, rewriting history isn't an issue *so long as* it's clearly your own personal branch and not e.g. master

[18:29:06] <krux02> rpav, no it doesn't make things slow, but as far as I can tell it introduces input lag, sadly.
[18:29:14] <krux02> not much, but input lag adds up
[18:29:37] <krux02> 1 frame of input lag AFAIK
[18:29:46] <rpav> 1 frame isn't lag
[18:29:53] <krux02> for me it is
[18:29:57] <rpav> no it's not

[18:30:15] <rpav> human perception of lag is 30ms at best, and usually like 45-90ms
[18:30:31] <krux02> rpav, I said it isn't much, but it adds up
[18:30:36] <rpav> krux02: it does not
[18:30:46] <rpav> also, there's always one frame of lag, it doesn't really differ with compositing
[18:31:06] <rpav> i.e. you type and nothing is rendered until the next monitor refresh relative to the current one
[18:31:06] <krux02> 1 frame here, because one frame is nothing, one frame there (it is also nothing) and one frame here again (it is also nothing)
[18:31:17] <krux02> and then in the end there is much input lag
[18:31:20] <rpav> that's not how it works

[19:44:26] <johnjay> lexical, lexical-binding, byte-compile--lexical-environment
[19:44:46] <johnjay> you can always check basic emacs behavior by doing emacs -q to not read your init file and -Q to not read any config files
[19:45:04] <johnjay> fun tip: you can test emacs behavior in a /tmp/ directory
[19:45:19] <Catie> Yeah, I can try to use that to diff what my configuration is changing
[19:45:22] <johnjay> just go to /tmp and do $HOME=/tmp/foo emacs and it will treat that dir as the init folder

[19:46:20] <johnjay> yeah i've been playing around with emacs on a mac and i've had to test some things
[19:46:28] <johnjay> example, apparently emacs uses Menlo as the default monospaced font
[19:46:38] <johnjay> but i was confused because i thought i chose that from the menu
[19:46:42] <johnjay> and it wasn't in any config file
[19:47:04] <thblt> Catie: Weird.  I'm not sure how Helm could mess with that.
[19:47:05] <Catie> In a no-config instance of Emacs I get the same "no results found" behavior. Perhaps it's my system configuration then
[19:47:07] <johnjay> so when i started it with no config I realized it was actually coincidence. Menlo is just the popular monospaced font on mac os
[19:47:17] <acdw> Catie: might be, who knows

[19:47:52] <johnjay> that's pretty weird. apropos shouldn't be affected by packages

[19:48:42] <Catie> I'm not, I'm seeing the issue now. I've been using C-h a, which is bound to apropos-command. Which only searches commands and nothing else
[19:48:57] <Catie> Okay, so that solves that mystery
[19:49:02] <johnjay> you can check any keystroke by doing C-h k then the key stroke
[19:49:17] <Catie> johnjay: oh don't you worry, I've been doing a whole lot of that
[19:49:51] <Catie> Along with C-h m it's one of my favorite ways to get information about what's going on
