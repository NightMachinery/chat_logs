[22:05:52] <alphapapa[m]> Ooh, is Andrea Corallo doing another talk on native-comp this year?  ...it's *really* hard to believe it's been a year since the last one...

[22:56:59] <zleap> hi
[22:57:36] <zleap> is it worth asking the fsf if we can get the minetest server up and running for emacsconf, it proved popular at Libreplanet
[23:08:12] <shoshin> alphapapa[m]: oh good point. i've been looking for an excuse to get back to matrix as well :)

[23:26:39] <sachac> if it can be up, do you want to hang out in it and help curious people who show up?
[23:28:16] <zleap> connect via mine test and play in one big game
[23:28:47] <zleap> I know Noisytoot made a big libreplanet sign in the game
[23:29:58] <Noisytoot> https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/libreplanet/2021/minetestlp2021.tar.gz
[23:30:46] <Noisytoot> I made the original one, but the world was reset and someone else made the new one
[23:30:53] <zleap> ah ok
[23:31:11] <zleap> Noisytoot, do you think it would be a good idea for emacsconf ?
[23:33:59] <Noisytoot> yes
[23:34:10] <Noisytoot> but it would be better to use Minetest 5.x this time
[23:34:50] <Noisytoot> Some FSDG-compliant distributions package 5.x, others package 0.4.x, either way some people are going to have to compile from source and minetest 5.x is better
[23:35:09] <zleap> i think a lot of people will just want it to work
[23:35:34] <Noisytoot> They'll both require manual installation for some users
[23:35:40] <zleap> esp a lot of kids who are not able to compile from scouce ( I know you can )
[23:36:08] <Noisytoot> There could be instructions on the website
[23:36:12] <zleap> from debian 11 minetest/stable,now 5.3.0+repack-2.1 amd64 [installed]
[23:36:12] <zleap>   Multiplayer infinite-world block sandbox
[23:36:35] <zleap> Noisytoot, The young people who come to code club are still using scratch
[23:36:45] <Noisytoot> Debian 11 and Guix have 5.x. I think Trisquel and Debian 10 have 0.4.x
[23:36:55] <zleap> sounds right for deb 10
[23:37:03] <Noisytoot> and they're incompatible, so the FSF will have to choose one or the other
[23:37:22] <zleap> ok lets ask
[23:38:12] <zleap> ok done, if you +1 that then maybe they will look in to it
