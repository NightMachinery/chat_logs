[12:46:10] <icing> a good morning to all the freezing Suomis, Swedes and people who do not build, but only assemble IKEA stuff! 
[12:46:42] <bagder> -18C this morning here
[12:46:51] <bagder> brisk
[12:47:36] <zelest> yeah, about the same here and a 8km bikeride to work :)
[12:47:47] <bagder> that'll wake you up!
[12:47:58] <zelest> oh yes :D
[12:48:30] <bagder> I actually drove my son to school today. he usually bikes
[12:49:11] <zelest> yeah, kiddo took the bus.. and on monday I get my new car, then I will retire my bike for this season :P
[12:50:17] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:9999:c810:1d5b:cbe6:4b3c) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[12:51:02] <bagder> not the ideal temp for an EV either =)
[12:51:51] <zelest> it will be fine.. preheat it 30 min before take off and it will be super warm and cozy.. :)
[12:52:00] <zelest> and never an issue starting it :D
[12:52:16] <zelest> but yeah, will have to keep it topped up more often
[12:52:21] <bagder> well, I meant that the batter is less effective and it needs so much more energy to drive
[12:52:30] <zelest> yeah
[12:52:38] <zelest> that goes for ICEs as well though :P
[12:52:43] <bagder> true
[12:52:55] <zelest> also, sorry for being defensive.. just ran into the guy at work who literally hates EVs :P
[12:53:05] <bagder> haha
[12:53:30] <zelest> "hurhur! yesterday it cost 800kr to charge a EV! and last week they had to pick them up from the highway because the batteries can't handle the cold! haha!"
[12:53:33] <zelest> ...
[12:53:43] <zelest> didn't even respond to him :P
[12:54:09] <zelest> a bit biased (and off-topic, sorry), but https://teslaclubsweden.se/elbilskaoset-som-inte-fanns/ :D
[12:54:22] <zelest> oh yeah, and swedish, sorry again :D
[12:54:31] <bagder> right, I read something about that
[12:54:48] <zelest> I find the whole ICE vs EV really intersting though
[12:54:56] <zelest> reminds me so well of when I was vegan a few years ago
[12:55:02] <zelest> tribalism at it's finest :)
[12:55:23] <zelest> the other side is always wrong and people love to bash them for every single thing possible :)
[12:55:43] <zelest> people should focus more on tech and less on politics imho
[12:56:09] <zelest> (and yes, I do realize I'm saying that after posting EV propaganda :D)
[12:56:20] * zelest goes sit in corner
[12:56:34] <bagder> haha
[12:56:44] <bagder> I just drive an EV and never discuss it
[12:57:05] <zelest> I drive my bike and complain about it daily :D
[12:57:31] <zelest> but I do talk about my future EV with lots of people.. and find the Tesla community to be super friendly and helpful
[12:58:01] <zelest> that, or maybe it's the moderators of the forum that remove the toxic stuff

[12:59:25] <zelest> ehlo!
[12:59:27] <GodEater> or Brisbane if you can spell
[12:59:48] <bagder> GodEater: my car said -18C this morning... =)
[12:59:59] <GodEater> ouch
[13:00:10] <GodEater> it's been 29C here most of the day
[13:00:13] <bagder> haha
[13:00:33] <GodEater> our dog just arrived from her spell in quarantine - she's unimpressed with the heat
[13:00:48] <GodEater> and has decided that aircon is an excellent invention
[13:01:16] <kushal> bagder, today morning I went to drop daughter to school and it was an experience (first time in the early morning in this temperature) 
[13:01:45] <bagder> kushal: I bet! This is however unusually cold for this early in the winter
[13:02:17] <kushal> bagder, good for us, getting the hit at first is good in one way :)
[13:02:18] <bagder> kushal: if you get the chance, do the hot water trick with a kid
[13:02:32] <kushal> wait, will it freeze like in youtube videos?
[13:02:34] <bagder> like a liter of hot water in a bucket and throw it in the air
[13:02:45] <bagder> it turns into snow immediately
[13:03:05] <kushal> is -14C is good for that?
[13:03:08] <bagder> oh yes
[13:03:16] <kushal> Ah, great to know :)
[13:03:18] <bagder> works even warmer, somewhere around -8C or so
[13:03:20] <kushal> It will be fun. 
[13:03:32] <bagder> the water needs to be warm though, not cold
[13:04:31] <bagder> my daughter almost 3 years ago: https://youtu.be/indgNcWH2m4
[13:04:33] <kushal> bagder, Understood
[13:04:40] * kushal goes to check 
[13:05:37] <kushal> bagder, nice :)
[13:05:42] <kushal> will surely do that :)
[13:05:56] <bagder> better do the beset of the situation =)
[13:05:59] <bagder> best
[13:06:21] <kushal> bagder, yes, just have to get such tips from you all :)

[13:10:37] <kushal> gevaerts, we moved from super hot parts of India to here a month back, so this is super fun :)
[13:10:39] <gevaerts> Also, welcome back to the real world of IRC, GodEater :)
[13:11:39] <gevaerts> I hope you won't regret that, kushal :) Although of course those super hot areas can be equally annoying. Can I recommend a place with a temperate climate? ;)
[13:11:55] <kushal> gevaerts, hehe :)
[13:12:50] <GodEater> gevaerts - thanks. Not sure it'll be very stable for a while - my server and main PC are still in transit.
