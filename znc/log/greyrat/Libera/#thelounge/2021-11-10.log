[00:28:24] <johncs> I’m not so confident there isn’t a bug activ8. The fact that it works for channels but not networks is unusual SMS wouldn’t be easily explained by a version mismatch
[00:29:11] <Activ8> I thought the networks and channels was tested on android though unless this is a special case of some sort
[00:29:58] <johncs> Android is a huge platform. Our testing was not sufficient to declare it flawless on android
[00:30:29] <johncs>  just like that Firefox big I mentioned yesterday… I tested that code on Firefox
[00:30:59] <Activ8> ah right
[00:32:58] <janis> Just checked on a fresh install - no dice
[00:33:03] <johncs> Sortable JS is also doing UA sniffing off some sort i believe… or somehow trying to identify a chrome on android browser, which is historically a fragile thing

[07:35:37] <thelounge86> I have a question about an option in the config file, the "useHexIp" one specially it says "This is done to share the real user IP address with the server for host masking purposes." the docs aren't very clear what it is for
[07:35:37] <thelounge86> Does "real user IP" mean the IP of a user connecting to thelounge? And is the "server" the IRC server? If so is thelounge sending my IP that I connect to thelounge with to the IRC network?

[07:40:58] <tumn> thelounge86: I could be wrong, but "for masking purposes" sounds like it means the irc network and thelounge server have to cooperate somehow to give each thelounge user a mask that reflects their real ip address (otherwise users will appear to connect with the instance's ip)
[07:41:26] <tumn> I assume the sends each user's ip address to the irc network if enabled
[07:41:31] <tumn> the setting*
[07:41:37] *** Quits: t00fb (sid524846@id-524846.lymington.irccloud.com) ()
[07:41:38] <tumn> somebody can correct me
[07:41:53] <thelounge86> That sounds reasonable but it is in the "users" section so I'm unsure
[07:42:07] <thelounge86> In the webirc section there is a part for sharing info with the IRCd if you have access
[07:42:11] <tumn> makes sense since it relates to users of thelounge instnace
[07:42:18] <thelounge86> So they seem distinct and unrelated
[07:43:25] <thelounge86> I would think it is related to user management as well, but why would thelounge need to hex an IP for a user to send it to itself
[07:43:30] <thelounge86> Unless I'm thinking about it wrong
[07:43:55] <tumn> to send it to the irc network, not to itself
[07:44:26] <tumn> sure thelounge sees each user's ip address but any irc network they connect to will see the ip of thelounge instance
[07:44:38] *** Joins: SmokenatorZ6 (~Smokenato@189.78.241.111)
[07:44:41] <thelounge86> Yeah that is the intended behavior
[07:44:54] <thelounge86> I'm trying to make sure thelounge isn't for some reason sending my connecting IP to the IRC network
[07:45:08] <tumn> unless that setting is explicitly enabled, it's not
[07:45:20] <tumn> and even if it was, the server would probably discard it unless configured to trust your thelounge instance
[07:45:24] <tumn> otherwise users could spoof ip addresses
[07:45:37] <tumn> again I could be wrong about this
[07:45:39] <tumn> but I wouldn't worry
[07:45:46] <thelounge86> This is encoded in the username field and only supports IPv4.
[07:45:48] <thelounge86> Says this
[07:45:55] <thelounge86> So I guess it'd be set as your username
[07:45:58] <tumn> that makes sense
[07:46:19] <thelounge86> Not sure under what circumstances you'd WANT to turn this on really, so it is confusing
[07:46:28] <tumn> I can imagine a couple use cases
[07:46:48] <tumn> e.g. hosting a public thelounge instance, or an instance for many users, and wanting to be transparent to the server about who is who
[07:47:19] <thelounge86> I suppose that is true, but if it is just a normal hex transform anyone can decode that
[07:47:32] <thelounge86> Maybe it is just me, but I think half the point of hosted IRC clients is concealing your connecting IP
[07:47:37] <tumn> ip addresses aren't considered personal information over irc
[07:48:00] <tumn> I personally use thelounge to conceal my ip address and idle in servers, but there are plenty of other reasons I can imagine it being used
[07:48:08] <tumn> it's definitely not the only use case
[07:48:12] <tumn> or even the primary one
[07:48:30] <thelounge86> I wouldn't consider it the end-all-be-all PII, but my home IP certainly isn't something I wanna give out
[07:48:37] <thelounge86> What if I anger some skid you know?
[07:48:43] <thelounge86> I like my home internet working
[07:48:58] <thelounge86> Don't wanna get DDoS'd off the planet by a 12 year old
[07:49:08] <tumn> by default, thelounge shouldn't give out your ip address
[07:49:17] <tumn> I've been using it for the same purpose and haven't had problems
[07:49:25] <thelounge86> Just wanted to check, since the doc is a little confusing about what it is for
[07:49:29] <thelounge86> Sounds good.

[08:31:21] <TonyStone> I am a little confused on setting up my webchat server.... i would like for my users to be able to have a username and password for the client itself(not any IRC network) so they can log back in the next day and see all messages as if tey did not leave
[08:32:49] <TonyStone> it seems like that capability isnt actually part of it?  I see that I can set it up as a "private server" but i would need some interface for users to creat usernames and passwords ...    no?
[08:41:55] <tumn> TonyStone: what you're trying to do is exactly what thelounge is for
[08:42:02] <tumn> but it's meant as a private or invite-only service

[11:17:18] <johncs> just tried to connect without TLS and got rejected by the server on that port.
[11:17:47] <johncs> Could be a reporting problem. Maybe you are connected via TLS but it's not showing up as a secure connection because there's another condition (besides TLS) that's not being met.
[11:17:51] <johncs> Like an old cipher or something.
[11:18:20] <bookworm> I mean, we're talking Debian. If it isn't at least 10 years old it doesn't get in
[11:18:34] <t00fbg> i connect with other network ''dalnet''
[11:18:36] <t00fbg> same happen

[11:20:25] <t00fbg> but
[11:20:34] <johncs> it's an old lounge release. is there any TLS relevant code in the package? Even like a list of ciphers?
[11:21:32] <johncs> My theory is that you are connected via TLS t00fbg
[11:21:45] <johncs> but your connection is still not labeled "secure"
[11:21:49] <johncs> because TLS is maybe not enough
[11:22:26] <t00fbg> i use letsencrypt

[18:18:28] <illsorted> Hi all, I'm having a bit of trouble authenticating to a new installation. I'm on Manjaro Linux, installed thelounge via AUR. Enabled/started the server with `systemctl --user enable --now thelounge.service` and can successfully connect to the server in my browser. Added a user successfully, but can't authenticate using the username/password. I just
[18:18:28] <illsorted> get 'authentication failed' when I try to log in. Any hints on how to troubleshoot this?

[18:35:55] <bookworm> you need to manually set THELOUNGE_HOME, the arch package defaults to the system directory in /etc
[18:36:07] <bookworm> but you're running the user service (why?)
[18:36:17] <bookworm> if you have root, use the system service
[18:36:37] <bookworm> there's no reason to run this as a real user
[18:45:41] <illsorted> I added the user like this: sudo -u thelounge add <user>
[18:46:01] <bookworm> why did you do that if you want to use the user service?
[18:46:11] <bookworm> that installs the user to the system directory
[18:46:31] <illsorted> OK, I'm just not very proficient =) I'll try to use the system service
[18:46:34] <bookworm> user means "use the linux user you are currently logged in as"
