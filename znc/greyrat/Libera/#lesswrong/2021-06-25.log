[00:03:28] <gwern> and I'm tired of all these sharp edges. did you know the pcre will loop infinitely if your regexp ends in '|' alternative instead of throwing an error or something sane
[00:04:39] <dbohdan> gwern: Ouch
[00:13:27] <filipepe> "This post is for paying subscribers" wah
[00:15:42] <dbohdan> Do paid posts more often have punny titles?

[00:18:29] <gwern> used a 'scan' and then a 'split' to approximate it... final result is, hm, faster than regex-tdfa but not amazingly so

[00:29:34] <gwern> ...yes, it actually runs at reasonable speed on the full site. annotations are just the worst case because it's thousands of paragraph-long documents
[00:32:06] <filipepe> gwern: I know you sold your bitcoin. Do you think people holding some should sell it as well?
[00:32:41] <gwern> yes. they probably are holding too much, and if they weren't holding any, would not right now rush out to put the cash equivalent into bitcoin
[00:33:06] <dbohdan> gwern: How many times faster is it?

[01:08:45] <two2thehead> gwern, +1
[01:11:03] <saturn2> dbohdan: i think the "ideas don't matter" meme originated as a response to the "i'm an idea guy" meme but it became decontextualized to the point where it doesn't really make any sense
[01:12:34] <dbohdan> saturn2: Sounds very likely.  Ideas don't matter when they are all you've got.
[01:12:34] <RiversHaveWings> wow... 112 degrees on Sunday?
[01:14:29] <gwern> (ok, time to try my next optimization idea: convert the document to plain text, run every regexp on that, keep only the handful that have a possible match anywhere, and then do the regular pass.)
[01:15:12] <dbohdan> gwern: Can you somehow do more/everything with gsub?  I guess you can't really afford to split and loop.
[01:18:32] <dbohdan> This is cargo culting, but you may also want to try disabling UTF-8 checking in PCRE
[01:18:46] <saturn2> dbohdan: it was more political than that. the idea was that "tech guys" were interchangeable commodities and "idea guys" deserved the lion's share of credit and rewards
[01:18:50] <gwern> dbohdan: the 'plain pass' should eliminate >99% of the regexps being tested against Str nodes, at the cost of running each of them once on the whole document, which will help a lot, I think
[01:21:02] <galambo> https://stallman.org/articles/dont-watch-covid-tv.html
[01:21:03] <Robomot> Don’t watch TV coverage of Covid-19!
[01:22:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't watch TV coverage of anything imo
[01:22:44] <dbohdan> saturn2: Right, that, too.  So applied rationality once again got trampled in the aftermath of a status play.
[01:22:51] <gwern> except war. tv coverage of war is great
[01:22:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[01:23:15] <gwern> or soccer. if you must follow soccer news, why would you listen to or read about it 
[01:23:23] <dbohdan> gwern: "the 'plain pass' should eliminate >99% of the regexps being tested against Str nodes"  Excellent
[01:23:55] <gwern> the downside is that the whole doc gets compiled, and then you run 600+ regexps against it up front. but the amortized cost should be great
[01:26:20] <gwern> ooh, much faster on annotations!
[01:26:27] <gwern> does this crack it?!
[01:28:48] <two2thehead> potential youtube bug/qol improvement. If I have a play-next-list playing it a tab, and I click 'add to play next list' on a vid in another tab, that vid starts playing in that tab
[01:29:06] <two2thehead> this should be easy to fix, and would improve watch time ceteris paribus, imo
[01:29:21] <gwern> yes, I think it does, barring horrible problems with correctness... maybe not even a 2x slowdown

[01:42:15] <Jayson_Virissimo> A Spanish prison....almost like he was going for the pirate legend aesthetic on purpose.
[01:46:29] <gwern> oh no. split deletes *all* the matches
[01:47:55] <superz> this is how I imagine saturn does his computing https://postimg.cc/xkm8Jr8y
[01:47:56] <Robomot> floor is absolutely proprietary — Postimages
[01:51:31] <ggreer> a lot of tesla owners don't seem to understand that the v2 superchargers are pairs and power is split between them. so if you pull up next to someone connected to charger 7A and plug into 7B, each person gets 75kW instead of 150kW
[01:51:50] <ggreer> but if only one of them is used, the car gets the full 150kW
[01:52:10] <two2thehead> is v1 'just' 75kW?
[01:52:15] <ggreer> I think so
[01:52:20] <ggreer> v3 is 250kW
[01:52:49] <ggreer> and no pairs. it's a quarter of a megawatt to each car
[01:53:12] <two2thehead> ah, yeah that's much better
[01:53:37] <saturn2> that's not something i would have expected most people to understand...
[01:53:44] <two2thehead> I was wondering if that would be something tesla would maintain
[01:53:55] <two2thehead> what saturn2 said
[01:53:56] <ggreer> also the bay area sucks a lot. I hate it even more than when I lived here
[01:54:26] <gwern> ggreer: they're just taking their fair share
[01:55:01] <ggreer> heh. I actually unplugged my car and went to another charging spot because an idiot parked next to me and charged from the same pair
[01:55:08] <saturn2> no other commonly used electric power source works like that
[01:57:05] <ggreer> it's odd to park next to someone when there are 20 empty stalls
[01:57:24] <ggreer> kinda like choosing an adjacent urinal when there are tons of empty ones

[02:25:17] <shawwwn> HOLY shit. I should probably check if the channel is active or whatever, but nah.
[02:25:48] <shawwwn> C'mon friendos, gather 'round the campfire, papa shawn got some shit to tell
[02:26:28] <shawwwn> so, https://www.google.com/search?q=anxiety+attack
[02:26:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that's a bizarre design and there's no reason to expect anyone to understand that
[02:26:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> This one is on Tesla tbh
[02:27:08] <shawwwn> if you're a normal (male?) programmer / hacker / techie / whatever, you probably haven't given much thought to the phrase "anxiety attack"
[02:27:29] <shawwwn> and if you heard it, you'd likely bucket it in the same bucket as "anxiety"
[02:28:15] <shawwwn> two days ago, my bucket for "anxiety" was... Well, a few of you have tried to see me be empathetic with people, and I've tried to be empathetic for people who say they have anxiety. I thought I could vaguely relate
[02:28:26] <two2thehead> with you so far
[02:28:38] <shawwwn> Nope. Uh uh. Not a chance. I assure you, you have *no* clue what anxiety, in the context of an attack, is like
[02:28:56] <galambo> who wants a classic thinkpad with eink? https://old.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/o3s8ea/gonetpc_is_now_selling_the_windows_rlcd_laptop/
[02:29:06] <Robomot> Ow! -- reddit.com
[02:29:08] <galambo> rlcd*
[02:29:13] <shawwwn> because I find myself in a very unique position of actually having had one, and attempting to communicate what that was like, so that others have empathy for those in that situation
[02:30:05] <shawwwn> the end goal is, if one of your coworkers ever says they need a mental health day, *even if you suspect it's bullshit*, it would be good to humor them and pretend they're having a medical emergency
[02:30:10] <bildramer> I've had something I would call an "attack" and I still put everything even vaguely similar in a "self-fulfilling prophecy, also signaling" bucket
[02:30:42] <shawwwn> because for people who are actually having an anxiety attack, I assure you, it's much closer to the "medical emergency" end of the spectrum than to "oh yeah, I'm feeling a bit burned out. I need a mental health day," side
[02:31:01] <shawwwn> and as far as I can tell, in the context of corporate america, that "mental health day" euphemism is the *only* shield to protect people
[02:31:06] <two2thehead> yep
[02:31:13] <bildramer> head or heart go asplode, except wait 30 minutes and actually write the exam and it passes
[02:32:15] <shawwwn> because if I had e.g. a critical meeting scheduled that day, and I went to a manager -- who, remember, can't possibly understand what an anxiety attack is like -- using 'mental health day" is the only phrase I can think of to get out of that day gracefully
[02:33:11] <shawwwn> an anxiety attack is similar to being dosed with lsd against your wishes, with none of the visual hallucinations. Or it was for me
[02:33:52] <shawwwn> remember, I'm speaking from my own experience. But how do I know I was having an anxiety attack? Because, thank god, someone else was there (my wife) who has had them many, many times throughout her life
[02:35:04] <shawwwn> she knew how to keep me grounded, was extremely empathetic, and even managed to somehow acquire a xanax (despite neither of us having a prescription) at the end, which ended the experience (which I desperately wanted to end) around 12 hours ago
[02:35:56] <shawwwn> so if you're thinking "Oh, maybe he just doesn't know and should see a doctor," yeah, I admit that possibility, but I also am quite certain I was sharing this with someone who experienced this exact same thing, and has been to many medical professionals over many years
[02:36:54] <shawwwn> at one point last night, I remember feeling vividly "if the rest of my nights are like this, I would gladly kill myself rather than live life like this" type feeling
[02:37:08] <shawwwn> so think "feet + hot iron" type situation, but for your mind
[02:37:38] <shawwwn> you probably wouldn't enjoy life none too much if you were spending it with a hot iron on your foot, forced, whether you wanted it or not
[02:38:19] <shawwwn> so for example, robin williams committed suicide. People said maybe it was because of ... well, I don't know. I do know that if his decision was related to this, then I empathize strongly with him
[02:38:46] <shawwwn> because his family said that doctors couldn't figure out how to help him, and if it was like this, then it was him trying to get that hot iron off his feet
[02:39:05] <shawwwn> "this is water" guy, same thing. DFW
[02:39:16] <shawwwn> No idea why suicide, know that if suicide because this, then empathy
[02:39:19] <bildramer> "this is water" guy?
[02:39:30] <shawwwn> https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/
[02:40:02] <shawwwn> so what's it like? well, emily said, you're not ever going to remember it as vividly as you're experiencing it now. And that's true
[02:40:35] <bildramer> oh I thought it was about some guy with an unconventional suicide
[02:40:37] <shawwwn> you know how scientific I am. I, at that time, did try to encode and analyze some of my experience, and file it under the "field notes for later" bucket
[02:41:24] <shawwwn> but, if I'm having trouble now, switching my mind back to what *just happened yesterday*, imagine how little you'll empathize with someone who is saying they "struggle with anxiety"
[02:41:29] <bildramer> kind of adjacent to urge to vomit and adjacent to headache but is neither
[02:41:49] <adiabatic> shawwwn: good to know, thanks
[02:42:05] <adiabatic> "LSD OD without the hallucinations", then?
[02:42:06] <shawwwn> it may be different for different people. Emily seems to be more in the camp of visual fuckery, whereas I was auditory fuckery
[02:42:17] <bildramer> this does make it sound less bad than it is I guess
[02:42:39] <shawwwn> well, sometimes legit hallucinations. I would say that there are hallucinations, and for me it was audio, and hers are sometimes visual
[02:42:43] <bildramer> it's actually somewhat reproducible though, just drink 8 cups of coffee and do something stressful
[02:43:27] <shawwwn> well, so, for example, if bildramer is trying to say "hey guys, here's a technique to get you to do something that maybe you can relate to people with anxiety attacks," I would say "unfortunately no, not even close"
[02:43:29] <bildramer> no need to find descriptions in terms of other things
[02:43:44] <shawwwn> oh wait
[02:43:47] <shawwwn> sorry.
[02:43:55] <shawwwn> that's the thing. anxiety attacks have triggers.
[02:44:11] <shawwwn> it may be true that for bildramer, drinking 8 cups of coffee and heading off to do something stressful, is that trigger
[02:44:27] <bildramer> I can only relate to having _one_ anxiety attack
[02:45:08] <shawwwn> yes. apparently I've had them in my past, but not to this degree. so therefore I suppose, for me (and you?), they're infrequent
[02:45:10] <bildramer> I think no matter what, if you enter a physical state close to that, your mental state will follow, you'll think you're dying etc.
[02:45:21] <shawwwn> ah.
[02:45:28] <bildramer> but having that regularly idk about
[02:45:39] <bildramer> must be hell
[02:45:56] <shawwwn> well, I didn't think I was dying
[02:46:39] <shawwwn> but I remember feeling that if I had, nothing would be lost, for sure. I don't think I'd *actually* go through with it if e.g. a gun were around, but it'd be "on the table" metaphorically, so to speak
[02:46:56] <shawwwn> and if it was that way for weeks on end, it'd be on the table literally.
[02:47:42] <shawwwn> so, apparently it's something related to seratonin. But universally, the sign that it was an anxiety attack, is "sleep makes it end, and everything is better when you wake up"
[02:48:02] <shawwwn> again, emily called it last night, by saying that. She was quite confident. I woke up today, and it's fine. She was right
[02:48:13] <shawwwn> so, some kind of physical something was at work
[02:48:43] <shawwwn> it also comes in waves.
[02:48:59] <shawwwn> I would say the initial attack lasted around 4 hours, starting at 10pm or so.

[02:58:37] <shawwwn> looks like libra had an anxiety attack. I'm going to resume my story -- to recap, the logs are here: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/shawwn/fe43d626a94259078af5fbb809d0d795/raw/67fb30b31a8b369d1cac3694b606685f117fd239/anxiety_attack_v1.txt
[02:58:56] <shawwwn> so, apparently it's something related to seratonin. But universally, the sign that it was an anxiety attack, is "sleep makes it end, and everything is better when you wake up"
[02:59:02] <shawwwn> it also comes in waves.
[02:59:07] <shawwwn> I would say the initial attack lasted around 4 hours, starting at 10pm or so.
[02:59:33] <shawwwn> when you "come down," it's really similar to coming down from a drug
[02:59:41] <shawwwn> because there's similar things at play.
[02:59:55] <filipepe> hello mr Presser
[02:59:58] <shawwwn> you return to rationality, everything seems to be more or less fine, you're in control of yourself, but there's still a twinge of fuckery
[03:00:12] <shawwwn> (hi filipepe!)
[03:00:35] <shawwwn> but the attack does come again, and again, until you sleep
[03:00:46] <shawwwn> (or at least, for me.)
[03:01:11] <shawwwn> this was fortunate to experience, because, it gave me the opportunity to talk with emily during periods of rationality

[03:02:19] <shawwwn> for one, it screws with your memory

[03:04:36] <shawwwn> it also fucked with my language. I reverted into caveman speak
[03:04:43] <shawwwn> I was able to communicate ideas
[03:04:54] <shawwwn> but it was conscious effort to string them together the way I am now
[03:05:18] <shawwwn> the point is, people who are having anxiety attacks, *can* be functional. you may have seen someone having one, who was trying really hard to keep it together
[03:05:52] <shawwwn> so maybe now you'll recognize some signs, or something. But all I know is
[03:05:54] *** nik0 is now known as niko
[03:06:24] <shawwwn> I was extraordinarily lucky that someone else was around who'd experienced that, because if I was alone and that happened, I would now be convinced I was literally, truly, totally crazy

[03:06:43] <shawwwn> and today I would again be rational
[03:06:51] <shawwwn> and have no context or medical diagnosis or nothing

[03:09:20] <shawwwn> I don't want to diminish rape victims' feelings whatsoever by using a metaphor. But for me, the way I kept wanting to describe this, is "mentally raped"
[03:09:29] <shawwwn> it's like someone snuck over and dosed you with LSD without telling you
[03:09:39] <shawwwn> you have no choice, no control, your agency is gone
[03:09:55] <shawwwn> if you're in the middle of a professional setting, you'd need to extract yourself gracefully from that professional setting
[03:10:29] <shawwwn> thus, mental health days, in my opinion, are a fundamental shield for people who experience these somewhat-infrequent events. But
[03:11:14] <shawwwn> what I've described, turns out to happen to varying degrees, to lots of people
[03:11:25] <bildramer> yikes. if you feel the need to write an "I would be shot by a commissar for saying this, but" disclaimer, just avoid the urge to use that language
[03:12:33] <shawwwn> I would accept being shot by a commissar for saying that. because I empathize strongly with rape victims, if it's anything like that. It felt like there was some external entity who was taking away my ability to function -- consent was lost
[03:12:35] <bildramer> I should self-censor but I'm not gonna < self-censorship < neither
[03:13:19] <shawwwn> the vivid metaphor may be necessary to break through the "you're less of a man if you experience that" feeling that so many 20-something engineers seem to have. I did
[03:13:31] <shawwwn> "just man up" is not an acceptable solution for this
[03:14:02] <shawwwn> and as far as I can tell, there are very few societal safeguards in place, or anything resembling a support structure
[03:14:27] <Logos01> shawwwn: It doesn't go away.
[03:14:29] <shawwwn> you'd end up feeling nuts from the day your first one happened, until the day you get into a counsellor's office and try to make sense of it
[03:14:38] <Logos01> I'm 40 years old and experiencing it every day I sit down for work.
[03:14:54] <shawwwn> yes. it does not go away.

[03:22:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Like, in many of these cases, there's an arbitrary claim about whether something is due to ideas or to execution, which is not supported in any way, and on which the entire point hinges; the authors just have intuitions about where to place that example, and if my intuition is the opposite then the argument they make instead proves the opposite of their point
[03:22:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g.: "In the policy realm, too, lots of people claim that the ideas to fix our various ills are “obvious.” “Just fix zoning laws and the rent wouldn’t be so high,” they say. And yet we don’t implement the supposedly obvious solutions. The constraint is that we don’t have enough good ideas on how to build a coalition to put these policy proposals into practice."
[03:23:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but of course we could also characterize this as "we lack the execution to put this idea into practice"!
[03:23:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you can recast any lack of good execution as, supposedly, a lack of ideas of how to execute properly, then of course you can say that everything is about ideas all the time
[03:24:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or the even more egregious:
[03:24:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "More ideas that are obvious at a high level but blocked by lacking underlying ideas to make them viable:
[03:24:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>     Bitcoin - electronic money obvious, solution to double spend problem non-obvious"
[03:24:45] <Dyo> galambo: you could probably circumvent that problem by insufflating B12 instead of the oral route
[03:24:59] <galambo> Dyo, I use sprays
[03:25:16] <galambo> Im not sure if they work any better though

[03:26:14] <Dyo> yeah should work better than oral. oral is just base small amount + some small percentage of whatever dose you're taking, hence monster doses used in oral supps

[03:28:00] <shawwwn> kuudes: ah, good point. I didn't cover coping mechanisms. the best thing to do is to get them to find something -- anything -- to keep their mind occupied. Apparently phone games work well
[03:28:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apple is all about execution!
[03:28:05] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: the whole argument is an absurdity. you obviously can't do anything without ideas. if you see that you're out of bananas you need the idea that you can go to the store and get more
[03:28:32] <Dyo> galambo: hm, doesn't mention insufflation.
[03:28:44] <saturn2> but equally obviously, sitting around all day doing nothing but having ideas will also accomplish nothing
[03:28:51] <kuudes> hmm, makes sense
[03:29:37] <Dyo> I started w injections, then oral, then insufflation
[03:30:00] <Dyo> basically the cheapest and simplest option
[03:30:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes... I think the question is whether ideas are a bottleneck or some such, which Guzey etc. are arguing they are
[03:30:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> This seems absurd to me tbh
[03:30:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I really can't get over how bad of an example Apple is
[03:31:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apple's whole damn thing for like the whole history of the company is that actually execution matters and details matter

[03:31:14] <Dyo> may have mentioned this before
[03:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> The difference between Apple products and non-Apple products has always been execution

[03:32:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe it's self-demonstrating! Maybe good ideas really are a bottleneck, and that's why they couldn't come up with a good idea for a post
[03:33:00] <nshepperd> if you don't have any ideas, obviously they'll be the bottleneck, since you'll just be sitting around going "hmm, I'm out of bananas... how vexing"

[03:33:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> That makes this post extra silly
[03:33:31] <gwern> maybe the big apple idea is that 'execution matters, and UI execution most of all'
[03:33:36] <galambo> Dyo, fwiw I once gave vitamin B as IV. the person had a very bad bleeding tendency and we were concerned they might have a haematoma if we give it IM. the manufacturer insisted that it was unsafe to give it IV though.
[03:33:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: lol :|
[03:34:01] <galambo> we gave it IV on advice of the hematologist
[03:34:01] <gwern> it's a pretty big idea. and you can tell few people like it because they don't imitate apple or apply it everywhere

[03:56:26] <kuudes> hmm, it seems to me that none but dbohdan has followed the prefix-bots plan
[03:57:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> What plan
[03:59:27] <galambo> kuudes, do you mean the '|' sign?
[04:00:04] <Logos01> galambo: I'm not seeing the exact comment but *usually* it's used in set-theory terms.
[04:00:10] <Logos01> As an "or" divider.
[04:00:17] <kuudes> yeah
[04:00:28] <kuudes> original was _ but | seemed to be the result
[04:00:54] <Logos01> So I'm apparently dedicated to making myself angry today because I've been listening to "atheist debates" for the last few hours.
[04:01:20] <kuudes> that is a good thing to notice
[04:01:21] <Logos01> I'm currently watching a video where Lawrence Krauss is having a debate with some Muslim I have never heard of before.
[04:01:38] <kuudes> facebook has smelt your blood and is feeding
[04:01:46] <Logos01> kuudes: I know right?
[04:01:54] <kuudes> sweet sweet clicks, the taste of engagement
[04:02:15] <Logos01> This is making me think about how often even other atheists reduce Krauss's "A Universe from Nothing" since he uses a Physicists' concept of Nothing rather than philosophical Nothing.
[04:02:58] <kuudes> should we make a gpt variant which would then be also trained on the length of the interactions?
[04:03:02] <Logos01> It just struck me that I suspect that actually dismisses something useful that Krauss actually did.
[04:03:05] <kuudes> so that it would prefer stuff that is long
[04:03:27] <kuudes> I guess it should be trained exclusively with interactive content
[04:03:29] <Logos01> Like, it's true that Krauss' book didn't demonstrate "something" coming from "nothing" in the philosophical sense.
[04:03:56] <Logos01> But he *did* demonstrate *substance* coming from *non-substance*, and that chips away at the immensity of the ontogenesis problem.
[04:04:18] <Logos01> Because then you're left with spacetime and the laws of physics, as opposed to literally everything else.
[04:05:28] <Logos01> And, like, saying "spacetime just always existed" is basically the same as saying "the void just always was."

[07:48:44] <shawwwn> eh, the thing is, SGD will never converge to the quality of adam solutions

[07:49:06] <shawwwn> I've been thinking of some kind of "next leap" like that
[07:49:17] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: i dunno, it just seems like a waste to have some parameters that never learn anything because their effective learning rate is 1 millionth of their range per step
[07:49:32] <shawwwn> wait what
[07:49:48] <catern> rmmh: as the young people would say it these days, "based"

[07:50:19] <shawwwn> why would some parameters never learn anything?
[07:50:40] <shawwwn> (we're talking about vanilla adam, right? no fuckery weight decay horsefactor bullcrap)
[07:51:00] <nshepperd2> Adam yes
[07:51:57] <nshepperd2> so, i have in my nn some weights where the magnitudes of the values are about ~1
[07:52:03] <shawwwn> I agree it would be a waste to have some parameters that never learn anything. But my understanding of adam was that every parameter was allowed the opportunity to learn something
[07:52:11] <shawwwn> and that if the parameter no change, adam no like parameter
[07:52:28] <nshepperd2> i have other weights where the typical magnitude is about ~0.01
[07:53:45] <shawwwn> assumptions entered.
[07:53:48] <nshepperd2> adam takes the gradient and divides it by the sqrt(ema(gradient^2))
[07:54:04] <shawwwn> yes
[07:54:12] <nshepperd2> and then multiplies it by the lr
[07:54:43] <nshepperd2> this is good. this makes it so the gradient step for each parameter is about ~1*lr in magnitude
[07:54:48] <shawwwn> there is a beta1 and beta2, and I forget which does what. I think beta2 is what you describe
[07:55:15] *** Joins: Nivim (~Nivim@184.99.53.55)
[07:55:39] <nshepperd2> but! this is also bad. because 1*lr is 100x bigger, relatively for a 0.01-sized parameter than a 1-sized parameter
[07:56:14] <shawwwn> unverified assumption entered
[07:56:19] <shawwwn> highly suspect assumption false
[07:56:23] <shawwwn> (about it being bad)
[07:57:21] <nshepperd2> this means that if you reduce the lr enough that the 0.01-sized parameter learns good and doesn't explode, the 1-sized parameter will take 100x as long to explore the possible range of useful values
[07:58:30] <shawwwn> hang on. let's check our ground assumptions. "i have in my nn some weights where the magnitudes of the values are about ~1"
[07:58:53] <shawwwn> my understanding of adam is, it operates based on gradients, not weights
[07:59:16] <shawwwn> in other words, when you say weights, I go "some fuckery is afoot, and it's probably in my head, not yours"
[07:59:18] <nshepperd2> that is, in the time that, say, the former has gone from +0.01 to -0.01 and back in the course of training; the latter will have explored 0.99 to 1.01
[07:59:33] <nshepperd2> yes, the weights
[08:00:21] <nshepperd2> adam takes the gradient, normalizes it by the sqrt(ema(grad^2)), multiplies by the lr, and adds it to the weight
[08:00:47] <shawwwn> sorry, I have to call out your logic, or else I'm useless to you
[08:00:59] <shawwwn> your very first sentence seems to contain a logical error. "I have in my nn some weights..."
[08:01:09] <shawwwn> why do the existing weights matter at all?
[08:01:13] <nshepperd2> yes, my nn contains weights
[08:01:25] <shawwwn> yes. but all that matters are the gradients
[08:01:29] <shawwwn> the gradients come from the loss function
[08:01:44] <nshepperd2> what do you do with the gradients, huh? you update the weights with them
[08:02:10] <shawwwn> they're w.r.t the weights, but that's irrelevant -- at least I think. what's relevant is that the nn is trying to optimize based on the loss function
[08:02:22] <shawwwn> it's trying to achieve the objective, so to speak, which is what the loss function represents
[08:02:51] <shawwwn> therefore, if a certain parameter was important, it would make that parameter have a higher gradient differential over time
[08:03:00] <shawwwn> a "more impactful gradient", so to speak
[08:03:10] <shawwwn> and "is this gradient impactful?" seems to be the central focus of your analysis
[08:04:06] <shawwwn> (my logic here could be dead wrong. I have no idea what I'm talking about. I just started two years ago.)

[08:06:51] <nshepperd2> that's not invariant to scaling of parameters
[08:09:08] <nshepperd2> here's a trivial example: we have a nn f(x) which is parameterized by a single number, x. we initialize x with 1, but the minimum loss is at say x=2

[08:09:48] <nshepperd2> if we use Adam, each step will update x by about 1*lr, until eventually it reaches the minimum at x=2
[08:10:36] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[08:11:19] <nshepperd2> now, what if we reparameterize to f(y/10000) and initialize y to 10000? this is exactly the same situation but with a differently scaled parameter
[08:11:36] <shawwwn> yes, I've done this.
[08:11:38] <nshepperd2> now Adam will again update y by about 1*lr per step
[08:11:58] <nshepperd2> and take 10000x as long to reach the minimum, with the same lr
[08:12:02] <shawwwn> no.
[08:12:12] <shawwwn> I don't know why "no" is the answer
[08:12:14] <shawwwn> my gut screams no
[08:12:20] <nshepperd2> yep
[08:12:25] <shawwwn> then I'm useless to you anyway
[08:13:04] <shawwwn> if that's true, I need to test that and force myself to believe it
[08:13:32] <shawwwn> because I swear I've done what you're saying.
[08:14:07] <shawwwn> I agree there are extreme cases, e.g. 1e21 would start to hit the limits of numerical precision
[08:14:42] <shawwwn> but I just... must not understand your math. I guess I'm misreading, is probably it
[08:15:04] <nshepperd2> though, it won't be exactly 10000x, since the variance ema(grad^2) that Adam uses to normalize is a combination of both minibatch noise and "training induced noise"
[08:15:12] <nshepperd2> but usually minibatch noise dominates
[08:15:33] <shawwwn> I was under the impression that it would take roughly the same amount of time. I'm willing to have a lot of wiggle room in that "roughly" word
[08:15:57] <shawwwn> but nothing like "a linear difference based on a linear operation in the loss function"
[08:15:59] <shawwwn> or rather
[08:16:22] <shawwwn> (get_variable("yorick") / 10000)
[08:16:41] <shawwwn> and get_variable("feep")
[08:16:48] <nshepperd2>  that is an important 'or rather'
[08:17:01] <nshepperd2> Adam is indeed invariant to scaling of the *loss function*
[08:17:03] <shawwwn> should be equivalent, as long as yorick starts 10000 larger than feep
[08:18:21] <shawwwn> y'know, you're likely right. I'm just the fool rubber ducking your ideas. I should just listen and think more

[08:19:53] <shawwwn> er, that it was a difference in training time
[08:20:02] <shawwwn> let's put it this way.
[08:20:39] <shawwwn> my hypothesis is, if you actually run the experiment you proposed above, on "something real" -- hell, I'll grant you MNIST as "real enough" -- that there would be "roughly no difference"
[08:21:13] <shawwwn> I just can't put my finger on why, and it's a silly thing to be like "well try it!" when it takes so much time to try anything
[08:21:53] <shawwwn> but that's why I've been hoping you'll try jax, since ideas are quite a bit easier to try, now (https://github.com/google/jax/issues/2108#issuecomment-866238579)

[11:18:08] <feep[work]> and as such find_by_lastname may actually do almost literally anything
[11:18:24] <feep[work]> lemme put it like this, a gpt-ruby would NOT have decided that "find_by_lastname!" should error if it was not found lol.
[11:19:11] <feep[work]> the point is more
[11:19:24] <feep[work]> I want a dwim compiler. I don't want, under any circumstances, a current human *attempt* at a dwim compiler.
[11:19:33] <feep[work]> because they invariably fail to dwim.
[11:20:17] <feep[work]> that said, { x } is awesome
[11:20:28] <feep[work]> it's like, what else would it mean? it's an object literal
[11:20:34] <quanticle> You want a FAI that you talk to with Ruby or Javascript instead of English, got it
[11:20:42] <feep[work]> so many of those are just { a : a, b : b, c : c, d : d } it's almost a bug if they *don't* match
[11:20:45] <feep[work]> quanticle: yes
[11:20:58] <feep[work]> the point is { x : x } is the common case, so make it short

[15:34:43] <kuudes> :D
[15:36:40] <kuudes> I presume you guys get enough info and stuff from your people, but to ruminate: when my kids were that age, we did so that we slept in turns to some extent, as I am a night owl, I stayed up late with the baby sleeping in a rolling bed next to my computer, and gave her milk supplement during the early night feedings, and when I went to sleep around 3 am, I pushed the bed next to her mother and went to sleep elsewhere. this way both of us got some sleep
[15:37:11] <cpopell> we'll probably transition to that
[15:37:24] <cpopell> right now wife is still doing full breast feedings
[15:37:35] <kuudes> my personal working theory is that main benefits of breastfeeding would occur when it would happen at least to some extent, but that the main energy could come from supplement, which could reduce stress to mother's body. but I am no doctor etc
[15:38:01] <kuudes> main downside of supplement could be that the mother's milk production could fall lower, I suppose
[15:38:39] <kuudes> breastmilk per my hypothesis contains also information from mother's bodily systems to the babys systems, so that would then explain its importance
[15:38:46] <kuudes> ie immune system tuning and whatnot

[20:51:16] <RiversHaveWings> Then loc = the image, and scale is driven arbitrarily low
[20:51:25] <RiversHaveWings> (Since the output is usually log scale)
[20:52:01] <RiversHaveWings> So. What if the VAE learned it could reconstruct pure white regions exactly

[20:52:58] <RiversHaveWings> And log scale for those regions was driven very low (like -7.4 or smth, that's what I actually saw in the poisoned areas just now)
[20:53:11] <RiversHaveWings> So when I sample random codes
[20:53:43] <RiversHaveWings> OK backing up a bit, what does it need to do to produce a value that low for like... a single region
[20:53:55] <RiversHaveWings> I mean in terms of its internal activations
[20:54:26] <dbohdan2> While nicely detailed, I am afraid this Andrew Quinn person's https://how-to-host-one-html.page/ makes hosting an HTML page look rather intimidating.  Neocities (free) or a shared host like NFS (paid) is easier than GitHub + Netlify.
[20:54:27] <Robomot> How to Host One HTML Page
[20:54:49] <RiversHaveWings> What if, to get scale that low at a single point, it has to have a huge region w/ relatively low scale
[20:55:14] <RiversHaveWings> Well, a huge region in its internal activations w/ weird values
[20:55:46] <RiversHaveWings> So there ended up being codes which produced very low scale at one point.
[20:55:54] <gwern> so you think it was just dirty data? lots of blank images?
[20:56:00] <RiversHaveWings> Now when one of these codes is sampled surrounded by a bunch of normal codes
[20:56:03] <gwern> and that created a strong prior towards blankness?
[20:56:22] <RiversHaveWings> It produces a huge area of low scale in the output and the network knows this corresponds to a huge area of white background in the real image
[20:57:09] <RiversHaveWings> i think it was the exact details of the training objective actually. vqgan doesn't do this, it doesn't have a scale output
[20:57:35] <RiversHaveWings> So perfect reconstruction means reconstruction loss 0 and it can't go lower by lowering the scale
[20:57:46] <gwern> ah, so a lot of blank images creates a spike in the distribution far away from natural images, and this 'blows out' the scaling/standard deviation?

[21:43:41] <two2thehead> "There were curious characteristics about the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 1977-78, which emerged from northeastern Asia and killed an estimated 700,000 people around the world. For one, it almost exclusively affected people in their mid-20s or younger. Scientists discovered another oddity that could explain the first: It was virtually identical to a strain that circulated in the 1950s. People born before that had immunity that protected them, and 
[21:43:41] <two2thehead> younger people didn’t.
[21:43:41] <two2thehead> But how on earth had it remained so steady genetically, since viruses continually mutate? Scientists guessed that it had been frozen in a lab. It was often found to be sensitive to temperature, something expected for viruses used in vaccine research.
[21:43:43] <two2thehead> It was only in 2004 that a prominent virologist, Peter Palese, wrote that Chi-Ming Chu, a respected virologist and a former member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told him that “the introduction of this 1977 H1N1 virus” was indeed thought to be due to vaccine trials involving “the challenge of several thousand military recruits with live H1N1 virus.”"

[21:50:13] <Robomot> Tianhe core module - Wikipedia (Tianhe (Chinese: 天和; pinyin: Tiānhé; lit. 'Harmony of the Heavens'),[7][8] officially the Tianhe core module (Chinese: 天和号核心舱), is the first module to launch of the Tiangong space station. It was launched into orbit on 29 April 2021,[1] as the first launch of the final phase of Tiangong program (Project 921), part of the Chinese space program.[3][5] …)
[21:50:33] <two2thehead> that's not command of space, that's just one space station
[21:50:54] <Logos01> You think having a permanently occupied space station doesn't imply a command of space?
[21:51:15] <two2thehead> power is relative. Compared to the US, they don't have command of space
[21:51:27] <two2thehead> now if the US wasn't around, then yes. they'd be a superpower
[21:51:34] <Logos01> That's not how superpowers work.
[21:51:41] <Logos01> It's not monolithic.
[21:51:56] <two2thehead> then we are arguing over typology, 
[21:52:04] <Logos01> *Yes*, for some time, the US was the only world superpower.
[21:52:10] <Logos01> But for decades it was the US and the USSR.
[21:52:39] <Logos01> The real question here -- the only one that's really salient -- is what kind of hegemony China projects.

[21:53:24] <two2thehead> sure, we are disagreeing on typology. I admit by your typology that China is a superpower
[21:53:42] <Logos01> two2thehead: Determining if a nation is a superpower is best done by determining to what extent they project uncontested hegemony.
[21:54:01] <Logos01> You point to military strength as a (valid) method of projecting hegemony.  It's certainly a major component of the US's role as a superpower.
[21:55:01] <Logos01> China is not equal to the US in this area, but it is the closest in military spending of anyone else in the world -- at 1/3rd the US's military budget. The *next closest nation* is ~25% of China's spending.
[21:55:53] <Logos01> They also have been following a pplicy of "soft" power and economic leverage over other nations. And certainly China is really the only other nation on the planet that can as a single nation force the US to the negotiating table on trade agreements -- which is to say, economically it's in "peer" status with the US.
