[14:34:14] <poncha> i'm trying to construct a multipart (multipart/form-data) manually with one of the parts being a file upload
[14:34:54] <poncha> all good and peachy until i try to pass the file content with specific content-transfer-encoding (base64)
[14:35:54] <poncha> in theory, every part in multipart may have its own content-transfer-encoding (unless i misread the rfc, which may indeed be the case)
[14:36:26] <poncha> but what happens in reality is that php gets the file in $_FILES as-is (base64 encoded string) instead of the binary
[14:37:03] <Naktibalda> why do you use that encoding?
[14:37:39] <poncha> because i'm trying to construct a viable example for my users for documentation and using a binary there will make it unreadable ;)
[14:40:10] <Naktibalda> well, PHP doesn't decode base64
[14:40:18] <Naktibalda> come up with a different example
[14:40:45] <poncha> is this just php or did i misread the rfc for this matter ?
[14:41:28] <poncha> yeah, i guess i'll thow away the binary data and just write "<< binary data here >>" or smth ;)
[14:41:34] <poncha> *throw
[14:41:59] <Naktibalda> how about using a path to file instead?
[14:43:37] <Naktibalda> this ticket says that PHP only supports 7bit, 8bit and binary: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48219
[14:45:35] <poncha> path for file for an example? or for actual payload? :) i need to get the actual file data from the api user, and i did stick to regular file upload mechanics hence the need to create a multipart (because there are additional parameters in the request telling where the file will go etc)
[14:46:08] <poncha> so the transfer encoding is a thing, just not base64 (in php) . thanks for the info! i'll work around that ;)
[14:46:47] <poncha> and i think i might need to add some alternate mechanism for pushing the file data (because of the amount of people who struggle to send those upload requests)
[14:52:02] <biberu> poncha: could you write the example as e.g. a curl command? does it have to be a raw request?
[14:58:29] <poncha> biberu: i could, but can it construct a multipart with form data (params) + the file without me acutally providing a full multipart myself ?
[14:59:42] <biberu> poncha: aim it at e.g. netcat to see how it formats the request
[14:59:42] <poncha> the request consists of some metadata fields (supplier id, expense sum , etc) + the file which is supposed to be scanned invoice of that expense
[15:00:26] <poncha> i already have the whole payload constructed, the only problem was binary vs base64 (which apparently is not supported by php in file uploads)
[15:01:01] <Blondie101010> do you mean by HTTP?
[15:03:20] <poncha> Blondie101010: not sure if it's defined in rfc for multipart/form-data (i thought it was at the time of asking the question initially ;) ) but on php receiving end - base64 is definitely not being decoded ;)
[15:07:59] <Blondie101010> hmmm, not sure how you're doing it, but why don't you encode it standardly?
[15:08:15] <Blondie101010> ie: like browsers do it
[15:10:23] <Blondie101010> I guess that could be your point about needing it to be binary, but that's simply because you're preencoding something that is meant to be encoded
[15:10:31] <poncha> Blondie101010: i do, but since i wanted to provide an example for documentation i tried to encode it as base64 to keep the payload human readable ;) i'll change it to keep without base64 and just change the binary into some placeholder
[15:10:50] <Blondie101010> base64 is not human readable
[15:11:04] <Blondie101010> the encoded payload is as readable as that
[15:11:09] <poncha> it is plaintext (unlike binary of an image or pdf file ;) )
[15:11:18] <Blondie101010> look at it properly encoded
[15:12:18] <poncha> the default is to keep it (the upload part) as-is (binary) , which makes sense as it takes the least amount of space
[15:13:41] <Blondie101010> I really fail to understand why you want a human to see text instead of an image binary data anyways
[15:14:35] <Naktibalda> I get it that he wants a copy-pastable example
[15:14:39] <poncha> yeah
[15:15:10] <poncha> but it's ok, there are ways to explain that without actually providing a fully functional sample ;)
[15:15:38] <Blondie101010> or you can encode your example
[15:16:26] <poncha> as quoted-printable ?
[15:16:55] <Blondie101010> I could still be missing the context
[15:20:47] <Blondie101010> providing reusable data for an API code sample can make things complicated if that's what you're trying to do
[15:21:12] <Blondie101010> examples usually generate them
[15:24:19] <poncha> i do have a (php) example code making that request, but people using other tools struggle still.  and unless i provide a sample in every possible programming language there will be complaints still ;)
[15:27:56] <Blondie101010> I'd prefer a .zip that works as is
[15:30:38] <Blondie101010> I might put a condition on the API to not process the demo normally
[15:30:52] <Blondie101010> depending on what it does
[15:31:21] <Blondie101010> that could actually be used for testing too

Given that the former is standard but a bit clunky with apparently a lot of associative arrays, should I go for the latter which promises a more OO interface?

[19:39:08] <void09> probably dumb recurrent question, but what places should I look for inreasing memory_limit value ? I already tried /etc/php/php.ini and while other parameters work, this one doesn't seem to get processed. It says 128M, and the wordpress plugin I am trying to use recommends 1024M, and says I have 512M available.
[19:39:59] <void09> I remember I run into this problem every couple of years I try some webscript, but always forget how to do it.
[19:41:52] <void09> php8, archlinux, nginx
[19:46:24] <__adrian> void09: in your ini file
[19:46:41] <__adrian> <?php phpinfo(); // visit this webpage in your browser
[19:46:52] <__adrian> assumming this is for a website ^
[19:47:21] <__adrian> remember you need to reload your webserver/php-fpm
[19:49:12] <void09> ok, it says 1024M in the phpinfo, as I set it in the php.ini
[19:50:09] <biberu> void09: your wp install wants up to 1GB (!) of memory for _one_ request?
[19:50:47] <void09> biberu: there's a woocommerce plugin that recommends 1GB memory_limit, claiming I have 512MB set. Will look at the code and try to see how it determines that
[19:50:56] <void09> Maybe there's some hard memory limit for such plugins
[19:51:25] <__adrian> void09: did you check your phpinfo as i suggested?
[19:51:44] <void09> __adrian: yeah as I said, it states 1024M, like the current value I have in php.ini, so the issue is not there
[19:52:25] <void09> I remember a few years back I had to set it in more than one place, and I thought it's the same now
[19:52:34] <__adrian> no
[19:52:44] <__adrian> check it to find which ini file is being used
[19:53:23] <__adrian> with nginx i'd assume you're using fpm, it's unlikely fpm is using an ini file in /etc/php/php.ini
[19:53:34] <__adrian> but all depends on how you installed
[19:54:31] <__adrian> OR if this plugin runs on the cli, you'd need to use   php -i
[19:54:36] <__adrian> to find it
[19:55:07] <biberu> that's insane, it'd better not do that under normal circumstances
[19:57:59] <void09> well it's a product import plugin.. to import 25k products via api.. so I guess it needs some space to breathe
[19:58:31] <dag> my goal is to keep a user logged in as long as their browser session lives. how can I solve this without increasing the session.gc_maxlifetime?

[19:59:39] <void09> Yes, I am using fpm. all the other settings the plugin recommended I adjust, which I did from /etc/php/php.ini, were updated successfully from the plugin's point of view.
[20:00:08] <biberu> void09: it shouldn't need to keep all that in memory
[20:00:31] <biberu> anyway, it doesn't relate to your issue, I'm just ranting ^^
[20:02:36] <void09> https://pastebin.com/raw/eQx4GYJE
[20:02:41] <void09> this is the code that generates that recommendation
[20:21:15] <Naktibalda> dag: add some javascript code to make ajax call every few minutes in background, it will update session timestamp
[20:21:40] <da_wunder> that kind of import task should not be run via browser - imho

[23:23:04] <dag> Sammitch: what is a straightforward way to implement "remember me" cookie?
[23:25:34] <Sammitch> add a field to the user record, generate a big chunk of random data, stuff chunk in field + cookie, if( session not logged in AND cookie exists and values match ) { make session be logged in }
[23:26:21] <Sammitch> and for the scope of the original question, do not set a cookie lifetime so that when the user closes the browser the cookie is removed.

[23:49:23] <dag> i understand thanks. i think the default session.gc_maxlifetime of 24 mins was very low though
[23:49:49] <__adrian> gc has NOTHING to do with session life
[23:49:57] <__adrian> don't try to use it that way
[23:50:16] <__adrian> it has to do only with deleting unused session files
[23:50:35] <Sammitch> session GC is about as straightforward as a bag of angry cats
[23:51:25] <dag> should i not use the builtin session mechanism?
[23:51:38] <__adrian> you should, if that's what you want
[23:51:57] <__adrian> i'm saying that all those "gc.session*" setting in your ini have NOTHING AT ALL to do with session management.
[23:52:00] <dag> sessions are considered garbage after 24 mins so afking for an hour usually requires relogin
[23:52:04] <__adrian> they have to do with garbage collection
[23:52:28] <__adrian> yes, a low timeout will consider them as garbage sooner
[23:52:35] <dag> im on debian though, there's a cronjob that cleans up garbage sessions
[23:52:39] <__adrian> but that's not directly the thing you're talking about.
[23:54:18] <__adrian> also note, rememberme ≠ session
[23:54:46] <__adrian> if you want extremely long sessions, (a) i don't recommend that at all, and (b) yeah, don't use file-based sessions.
[23:55:03] <__adrian> bbl
[23:55:40] <dag> yeah i did consider that the sessions directory would grow large with longer session lifetime. so a remember me cookie that lasts a few days seems ok
[23:57:39] <__adrian> if you want sessions to remain "while the browser is open" (not sure if that was you?) then an alternative is keeping session settings as they are, but using js to ping the server and keep the session alive
[23:58:40] <Sammitch> different
[23:58:46] <__adrian> k
