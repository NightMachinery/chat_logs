[00:43:03] <kline>  Brekkjern | How would Russia communicate with their troops if the internet or power grid were down?
[00:43:08] <kline> they already cant so why worry?
[00:43:23] <Brekkjern> It was a joke
[00:43:35] <kline> only half
[00:43:59] <kline> suggestions are they are sending secure info over the civvie cell network and getting routinely intercepted
[00:44:21] <kline> russia blowing up the cell system might actually improve their opsec
[00:44:44] <Brekkjern> Eh. They'd start using smoke signals instead I bet
[01:34:32] <Church> Is anyone still trained in that?
[01:44:05] <Brekkjern> lolno

[02:34:43] <kline> Church, smoke signals no, but definitely morse (for signal lamps) and semaphore
[02:34:51] <kline> not routinely used, though

[03:29:27] <buttsbot> Twitter - charles_lister - NEW - reports of a rocket attack &amp; targeting the U.S. consulate in #Erbil just now. Large explosions heard.  Several fighter jets now heard in the skies, per locals.
[03:31:44] <Church> Super fun times
[03:33:42] <drakonis> try fingers but hole
[03:34:27] <Church> Heh
[03:34:55] <Church> I debate between blog code, Elden Ring or anime/manga backlog. What to do...
[03:41:24] <defect> is there a super-easy-i-just-want-to-explore-the-world setting for elden ring?
[03:41:41] <Church> There's a mod I think

[03:41:56] <buttsbot> Twatter - nexta_tv - ⚡️#Iran reports that the attack targeted Mossad facilities in #Iraq, which had previously eliminated Iranian officers in #Syria by the Israeli Air Force.
[03:42:15] <ngoldbaum> i see
[03:42:20] <ngoldbaum> that makes more sense
[03:42:59] <ngoldbaum> how are you all dealing with the dread of world war iii
[03:43:08] <ngoldbaum> because i’m dealing with it very poorly
[03:43:22] <Church> Meh
[03:43:31] <Church> Nm I can do
[03:43:38] <Church> Might as well relax for now
[03:45:15] <ngoldbaum> that’s the thing i can’t relax

[03:55:46] <skyl4rk> been dealing with constant possibility of this being the so-called end times for a while now, it has lost its novelty, that the cause may be shifting from global pandemic to global war is news in direction, but not news in magnitude
[04:05:35] <skyl4rk> I guess, if possible, avoid news, avoid doomscrolling, I'm helped by not having a social media presence on the usual platforms
[04:06:20] <skyl4rk> avoiding news is of course connected to dangers of its own

[15:02:00] <kronk> skyl4rk: all I'm doing is living my best life right now.
[15:03:01] <kronk> spending time with family, my cousin came out last week.
[15:03:21] <kronk> taking my nieces to playgrounds, enjoying that we're financially secure.
[15:03:42] <kronk> ordering good food, laughing, playing games. tomorrow we might go swimming.
[15:05:19] <kronk> be glad we're far from the conflict. keep an eye on it, but stop letting it become your entire life.
[15:07:01] <kronk> we've had _far worse_ conflicts than this in the past. I think we tend to forget that.
[15:08:21] <kronk> take solace in your safety.
[15:15:07] <skyl4rk> I'm doing ok, thanks. I meant to elaborate that there has been a lot of bad things for some time lately, and my mind has adapted, dulled those senses.
[15:15:47] <kronk> that's about the only thing you can do for things you can't control.
[15:17:30] <kronk> if you were on the ground, you'd adapt. the problem is we're seeing all of this from afar, and due to the proliferation of first-hand accounts, video, etc. we think it's in our back yard.
[15:17:58] <kronk> your animal brain thinks on-the-screen danger is real danger. because it's definitely real, just for the people it's _happening to_.
[15:18:24] <kronk> then stress hormones get dialed up and you feel that fight-or-flight reflex.
[15:18:34] <kronk> when in reality, nothing is happening.
[15:19:07] <kronk> you're sitting in bed, probably thousands of miles away.
[15:20:11] <kronk> you'll get up for breakfast, you'll walk the dog, you'll do some work, chat with friends.
[15:20:44] <skyl4rk> Even so, worse things in the past tends to have the 'worse' part mitigated by 'in the past', at least when it comes to individual level experience I think. It also differs since one ages as an individual and goes through different phases of life, I was just a kid during the genocide in Rwanda, and now I'm an adult trying to find my own way in life while Russia is on the war path..
[15:21:55] <skyl4rk> (even so - I started writing when your only comment was on the worse/in the past, not 'even so'-ing all the other things you wrote since tehn)
[15:22:09] <kronk> heh.
[15:22:19] <skyl4rk> *then
[15:29:16] <skyl4rk> last few days has given me hope that the winter cold (as in coughing, not snowing) is losing its grasp on me, and then I can get on the bicycle and get out of the house a bit. that will make a difference
[15:31:43] <kronk> definitely, it's amazing how getting out makes you feel.

[22:54:30] <skyl4rk> they say garlick is measured by the heart, not in cloves. I find the same goes for ginger
[22:59:19] <river> he has a massive following
