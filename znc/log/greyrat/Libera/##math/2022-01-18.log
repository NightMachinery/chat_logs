[06:08:14] <PlanckWalk> Instead of P(n) defined as "S_n < 2^n", it's easier with the strong form P(n) = "S_k < 2^k for all k <= n"
[06:08:23] <tusko> obviously I'm trying to use the IH that S_k = S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) + S_(k-3) < 2^k to prove S_(k+1) = S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2*2^k I'm just struggling to see how to do that
[06:09:05] <tusko> ok, when you say stronger you mean it says more or are you implying strong induction?
[06:09:38] <PlanckWalk> "Strong induction" is just ordinary induction with a particular form of hypothesis
[06:09:56] <PlanckWalk> Not a different thing, just a particular example of thing.
[06:10:26] <PlanckWalk> In this case the inductive hypothesis is "stronger" in that it makes a stronger claim.
[06:11:07] <tusko> Is that right? "s_k < 2^k for all k<=n"? n seems ambiguous somehow
[06:11:11] <PlanckWalk> It claims that yes, S_n < 2^n but also that S_(n-1) < 2^(n-1) and so on.
[06:11:25] <PlanckWalk> n is the inductive variable.
[06:11:49] <PlanckWalk> P(n) = "S_k < 2^k for all k <= n"
[06:12:38] <PlanckWalk> A hypothesis of this form is sometimes called "strong induction", but it's really just induction.

[06:54:14] <PlanckWalk> Though they are somewhat related.
[06:55:12] <PlanckWalk> In fact it would work even if some of the terms did have differences greater than between successive values of 2^n
[06:57:37] <PlanckWalk> E.g. if the terms started with  1, -10000, 1 instead of 1,1,1.
[06:59:45] <tusko> I guess I just don't get it then
[07:00:49] <tusko> It does happen to be the case that each term S_k < 2^k for all k<=n by hypothesis. This is easy to show for P(1), P(2), P(3), and P(4).
[07:02:01] <tusko> So then P(k+1) says S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2^(k+1)
[07:02:30] <tusko> or S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2*2^(k)
[07:03:08] <tusko> ok, and then all three of those terms are less that 2^(k)
[07:03:37] <PlanckWalk> You have tighter bounds for the previosu terms
[07:03:38] <tusko> so maybe that means its obvious(tm) that their sum is less than 2*2^k
[07:03:51] <tusko> yes, of course
[07:04:02] <PlanckWalk> So why are you making them uselessly loose?
[07:04:10] <tusko> I'm not very smart
[07:04:30] <PlanckWalk> S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2)
[07:04:40] <tusko> ahhh

[07:05:06] <tusko> yes, that is a true statement
[07:05:19] <PlanckWalk> And  2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) < 2^(k+1)

[07:06:45] <tusko> that's an interesting proof
[07:06:55] <tusko> thank you for helping me to see that
[07:07:03] <PlanckWalk> Glad I could help :)
[07:08:27] <drazak> for k > 2 anyway :)
[07:08:45] <tusko> Do you think I should do something to prove 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) < 2^(k+1) or is that obvious?
[07:09:00] <PlanckWalk> It's fairly obvious, but you can make it more explicit
[07:09:37] <PlanckWalk> 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) < 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-1) = 2^k + 2 * 2^(k-1) = 2^k + 2^k = 2^(k+1)  for example

[07:31:34] <isekaijin> Hello. Today I don't really want to do mathematics, so let's talk about abstract algebra. Consider pairs (R, S), where R is a ring and S is a submonoid of its group of units. However, I don't really want to say “group of units”, so I'm going to axiomatize it differently.
[07:32:44] <isekaijin> We have an injective monoid homomorphism from S to (R, *) and we have an operation r/s (with r \in R and s \in S) such that (rs)/s = (r/s)s = r.
[07:33:03] <isekaijin> Notice that S does NOT have to be the whole group of units of R.
[07:33:13] *** Quits: XCode (~XCode@d108-173-59-218.abhsia.telus.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:34:29] <isekaijin> The point to doing this is to avoid defining the group of units as a subset of R. Subsets of a type are problematic when you try to implement them on a computer.
[07:35:51] <isekaijin> Instead we require the user to specify the elements that they want to consider invertible.
[07:36:43] <isekaijin> Are there use cases for this kind of thing? Could anything good come out of potentially willfully ignoring that some invertible elements of a ring are, in fact, invertible?
[07:36:46] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[07:37:48] <isekaijin> My intuition for invertible elements is that they are the nowhere vanishing functions on Spec(R).
[07:38:34] *** Joins: XCode (~XCode@d108-173-59-218.abhsia.telus.net)
[07:40:56] <isekaijin> If instead we have to explicitly specify S as above, then we are basically saying that we can't deduce which functions are nowhere vanishing from R alone.
[07:43:17] <isekaijin> (This is less crazy than it might seem to a classical mathematician. The group of units of R might not be be a subset with decidable membership.)

[09:10:41] <greenbagels> cluelessperson: in general, when you want to visualize "equation 1 and equation 2", you imagine all the points that belong to equation 1, and all the points that belong to the graph of equation 2, and you look at what's in both

[09:11:16] <greenbagels> and the part of the plane covered by x>2

[15:50:29] <Smilex> Well P(x1, x2, x3, x4) = (x3, x4, 0, 0)... I just realised that no it's not injective, because it fails what you mentioned

[15:51:48] <Smilex> Ok, so it's not invertible
[15:52:05] <drazak> yeah, so that should let you discount large swathes of example space
[15:52:24] <Smilex> Oh.
[15:53:03] <Smilex> well would P(x1, x2, x3, x4) = (x2, x3, x4, 0) be a larger matrix?
[15:53:53] <drazak> pick a basis and write a matrix down

[19:58:49] <isekaijin> Xardas: For example, x^2 + x + 1 is a real polynomial, but its roots are complex.
[19:58:59] <cadmio> the fact that you've the unity 1 allows you to write say if r_1 = 1 then you've 1*a_1 + r_2*a_2 _ ...
[19:59:28] <Xardas> x^2 +1  too !! :D
[19:59:32] <isekaijin> Yeah.

[19:59:32] <cadmio> how can I have the elements a_1, a_2, ... a_m
[19:59:34] <Z-module> cadmio, yes, if R lacks 1, then that set might not contain all of S or even any single thing in S
[19:59:48] <Xardas> that's funny
[20:00:29] <riv> let alpha be the roots of the poly, form Delta = (alpha_1 - alpha_2)(alpha_1 - alpha_3)...(alpha_2 - alpha_3)...(alpha_{n-1} - alpha_n), this is the discriminant

[20:02:14] <isekaijin> But I wanted to avoid mentioning the roots that aren't guaranteed to exist in the ground field.
[20:02:32] <isekaijin> Surely we can give an intrinsic definition that doesn't require “stepping outside of the ground field”.
[20:03:09] <isekaijin> cadmio: By definition, ideals are closed under linear combinations. So the ideal generated by the a_i has to contain the linear combinations you mentioned.
[20:03:24] <riv> algebraic closure always exists so i don't mind using it
[20:03:26] <isekaijin> cadmio: The only thing that you need to prove is that the set of linear combinationed you mentioned is, in fact, an ideal.
[20:04:14] <cadmio> isekaijin: it has to contain the single elements a_i as well
[20:04:26] <isekaijin> cadmio: a_i = 1a_i + 0
[20:04:39] <isekaijin> cadmio: So your linear combinations are already included.

[20:05:03] <isekaijin> So your original generators are already included.

[20:06:21] <Z-module> cadmio, it's quite similar to how if S is some subset of a group G, then the subgroup <S> generated by S is the set of all finite products t_1...t_n where for each t_i, either t_i or (t_i)^-1 is in S.  A subgroup containing S *must* have all of those, and also the set of all of those *is* a subgroup.
[20:06:29] <Z-module> That's what "generated by" means.
[20:07:28] <Z-module> Also, what isekaijin said. There are some slightly amusing things about rings without 1, but mostly no one ever uses such things.
[20:08:53] <isekaijin> I have run into exactly one ring without unit that is useful - Schwartz space.
[20:09:00] <Z-module> I guess the only slightly meritorious candidate for one is the rng (means ring without 1) of all continuous real functions f on [0,1] with f(0) = f(1) = 0.
[20:09:14] <isekaijin> Okay, I have run into two.
[20:09:31] <cadmio> the sum goes from 1 to m so if r_1 = 1 if you take the term a_m = r_m a_m now r_m is not 1 because r_1 = 1

[20:29:52] <laurus> E.g. a little of Part I, most of Part II, and some of Part III
[20:30:01] <cadmio> isekaijin: if the ring contains a unit you don't need the linear combination with natural numbers
[20:30:01] <Z-module> especially if they're more general, not about very specific weird functions
[20:30:16] <laurus> Z-module: What I used to do is get a syllabus for a course that used the book, and then follow that, that's what I did for that Goldberg Analysis book and it worked really well, some of the problems were really necessary for later work
[20:30:21] <isekaijin> cadmio: The natural numbers serve as the indices.

[20:31:00] <isekaijin> cadmio: Linear combinations are sums of finite but arbitrary size, so the first thing you need to choose is the number of summands.

[20:33:47] <cadmio> the fact I don't get is that you've a single sum so you've to set all coefficients one for all
[20:34:52] <cadmio> if you set one to 0 like you said earlier one in the example "a_i = 1a_i + 0" so you're setting all r_i to 0

[22:01:32] <Guest1778> Can anyone help me understand this: https://i.imgur.com/zqXvXU4.png with an example? The set of real numbers R is an infinite field. Define a polynomial on the ring R[x1, x2, ..., xn]...so like f(x,y) = y - x^2. But I don't understand the rest of the proposition
[22:02:05] <Simplar> There are no ways to make our sequence to consist of even amounts of numbers because we'll always get odd number multiplied by x
[22:03:11] <Simplar> But we can make our sequence consist of odd amounts of number in the following way: x, 10x, 0.1*(10x), 10x, 0.1*(10x), ..., i.e. as 0.1*10 = 1, we get raw x on odd places.
[22:03:53] <D5n9sMatrix> #octave A  =[10, 0, 10; 10, 2, 20; 10, 3, 30];  format bank  solver A * 2 + pi
[22:04:17] <Simplar> Since we now know the sequence must consist of odd amount of numbers, we can use this to formalize the 'maximum' way.
[22:05:07] <Simplar> We must have even amount of 1x's and odd amount of 10x's in the sequence in order for it to work and give us an even number multiplied by x when summed up.
[22:05:22] <Simplar> i.e. 2y-1 tens and 2y ones
[22:05:41] <Simplar> thus, (2y-1)*10x+2y*x = 1860
[22:06:07] <Simplar> From there we can easily get to a Diophantine equation (11y-5)x = 930
[22:06:19] <Simplar> and it only has two solutions
[22:06:29] <Simplar> over positive integers, of course

[22:06:46] <Simplar> (155;1) and (1;85)
[22:07:16] <riv> Guest1778: we can look at the 1 variable version first
[22:07:17] <Simplar> We want the maximum amount of members inside the sequence, thus we take 85 for y
[22:07:52] <riv> it's saying if you have a polynomial f in R[X], then f = 0 iff f(x) is the zero function
[22:07:55] <Simplar> from there, we can get the total amount of maximum members of that sequence, evaluating 2y-1+2y = 4y-1 = 4*85-1 = 339
[22:08:05] <Guest1778> wtf

[22:09:14] <isekaijin> Let's start with the basics. A polynomial is a formal linear combination of monomials, right?
[22:09:24] <Guest1778> yeah
[22:09:40] <isekaijin> You can evaluate a polynomial as if it were a function, but a priori, there's no reason why a nonzero polynomial couldn't evaluate to the identically zero function.
[22:10:07] <isekaijin> For example, the polynomial x^p - x over the finite field Z/pZ evaluates to the identically zero function.
[22:10:28] <isekaijin> What the proposition is saying is that this doesn't happen when the ground field is infinite.
[22:11:00] <isekaijin> This is proved by induction on the number of variables, and ultimately, it boils down to the fact that polynomials have finitely many roots.
[22:11:08] <isekaijin> Errr, polynomials in one variable.
[22:11:16] <Guest1778> in 1d, I can write a polynomial like this: f(x) = x.
[22:11:36] <Guest1778> or like 2x
[22:11:40] <isekaijin> Yeah, but this polynomial doesn't evaluate to the identically zero function.
[22:12:01] <isekaijin> The only case in which 2x evaluates to the zero function is when 2 = 0 in the ground field anyway.
[22:12:07] <Guest1778> uhm
[22:13:00] <Guest1778> to my understanding, the proposition is telling me any polynomial in the ring, when we find solutions for it, must be the zero polynomial. And that doesn't make sense
[22:13:37] <Simplar> Is a polynomial x^6+x^3+1 irreducible over Q?
[22:13:53] <isekaijin> Guest1778: You're misunderstanding the proposition, then.
[22:14:04] <Guest1778> I know I am, THat's what i'm trying to fix
[22:14:11] <isekaijin> Guest1778: f = 0 doesn't just mean “the polynomial has roots”.

[22:15:12] <isekaijin> Guest1778: “f = 0 in K[x1,...,xn]” means “f is the identically zero formal K-linear combination of monomials”.
[22:15:14] <Z-module> Simplar: yes
[22:15:38] <Simplar> Eisenstein's criterion, I guess?
[22:15:43] <Guest1778> that is very confusing
[22:16:00] <Z-module> yeah Simplar, use y = x + 1  for that
[22:16:05] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[22:16:14] <riv> Guest1778: what was confusing about what I said?
[22:16:32] <riv> you just said "wtf" and didn't elaborate
[22:16:41] <isekaijin> Guest1778: Then all that I can do is tell you that you review your basic algebra.
[22:16:41] <Z-module> sorry, y = x - 1
[22:17:07] <isekaijin> It's okay to find the proof of the proposition a little tricky or hard to come up with.
[22:17:10] <isekaijin> Guest1778: ^
[22:17:41] <isekaijin> But if you don't understand the proposition itself (not its proof), then you really need to review material from earlier algebra courses.
[22:18:41] <riv> sigh :)
[22:18:43] <Guest1778> "if you have a polynomial f in R[X], then f = 0 iff f(x) is the zero function" -- I'll write a polynomial: f(x) = 2x - 1. Then f(x) = 0 is supposed to mean that f is the zero polynomial?
[22:18:44] <Guest1778> But f(x) isn't the zero polynomial.
[22:18:51] <riv> oh i got a reply
[22:19:10] <riv> Guest1778: Are you familiar with the distinction between polynomials and functions?
[22:19:19] <riv> i.e. a polynomial is not a function, but it can be turned into one
