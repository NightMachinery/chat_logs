[03:28:39] <artao> keeps getting pushed later into april, even early may
[03:28:44] <artao> rarely much snow
[03:28:56] <FreeRangeDillo> the weather has gotten so weird
[03:28:58] <artao> sub-actric deep freeze in january thru february
[03:29:16] <FreeRangeDillo> guess you heard about the arctic storm that hit Texas in February of last year
[03:29:25] <artao> over the year we're like 14.5 inches low on precipitation
[03:29:33] <FreeRangeDillo> damn near knocked out the power grid
[03:29:41] <artao> which is becoming the new normal
[03:30:09] <morlog> i like this kind of weather
[03:30:16] <artao> i like snow
[03:30:22] <FreeRangeDillo> 3 inches of snow on the ground in Austin with sub-freezing temps for over a week falls under the category of 'that shite don't happen'

[03:31:46] <morlog> the few times that ive spent winters up north I loved it

[03:32:15] <artao> the briskness
[03:32:53] <FreeRangeDillo> snow is very pretty and best viewed through a window in a warm room ;)

[03:34:54] <FreeRangeDillo> maybe it was because I was born in Florida, but I'll take heat over cold any day
