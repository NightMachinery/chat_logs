[00:36:01] <SnoopJ> aphysically, there isn't a semantic difference between these in this case (there might be if your translation keys and targets overlapped, replace() wouldn't be suitable for that). The first one does all the work itself, the second one lets the runtime do all the work in one pass

[00:37:14] <SnoopJ> aphysically, if you want to think about it in terms of complexity, the middle one is 2 scans of the string (2N operations), the top one is N scans (N² operations)
[00:37:54] <jabberwock> I love that you think in code complexity
[00:38:27] <SnoopJ> oh, sorry, I conflated chars and string. If string is length N, chars is length M, the top one is N*M work, the bottom is N+M work
[00:39:05] <SnoopJ> but it's just kind nicer to express what you want done than *how* you want it done, and translate() does a nice job expressing "I want these thingies turned into those thingies"

[00:41:05] <SnoopJ> aphysically, replace() does that loop for you, but usually in a faster language.

[03:39:34] <matsaman> I think all the "big" colors are like ... 60 off from one another? Or 30?
[03:39:35] <matsaman> something like that
[03:39:36] <xMopx> iirc 180˚ off on h is a perfect invert

[03:40:07] <xMopx> ill check that out, ty
[03:40:19] <matsaman> xMopx: yeah 30: https://hslpicker.com/#ff9d00
[03:40:20] <SnoopJ> matplotlib has an implementation, but this is not a "throw in a hex code, get out hex codes" solution

[03:41:56] <matsaman> I mean there are infinite colors, but the more you use the less contrast they'll have to the extant ones
[03:42:01] <xMopx> in other words, some kind of rule that prevents it from emitting a color too similar to the source color
[03:42:04] <matsaman> but it's still worth pursing for lots of things

[05:02:50] <grym> the other areas of many choices lots of confusion include: packaging and distribution, cli parsing, venvs and python versions

[14:43:05] <lericson> how is it that a < b < c works in python?
[14:43:50] <deniska> lericson: as a special part of syntax
[14:43:53] <grawity> it just does
[14:44:07] <grawity> language syntax works in whatever way it's defined to work
[14:44:19] <lericson> i mean mechanically why does it work
[14:44:24] <lericson> while it doesn't with numpy for example
[14:44:38] <deniska> lericson: python translates it to (a < b) and (b < c)
[14:44:53] <lericson> aha
[14:45:04] <lericson> and this coerces a < b into a bool
[14:45:13] <lericson> whereas it's an array of bools in the numpy case
[14:45:17] <mgedmin> and also takes care to evaluate b only once
[14:45:46] <deniska> lericson: `and` doesn't coerce to bool, but code can't override what `and` is doing
[14:46:14] <lericson> and what is and doing
[14:46:38] <deniska> `and` evaluates either to the left side if it's truthy, or to the right side if it's falsy
[14:46:46] <deniska> wait, that's `or`
[14:46:50] <lericson> i called that coerce to bool but i guess that's not literally true
[14:46:55] <deniska> `and` evaluates either to the right side if it's truthy, or to the left side if it's falsy
[14:47:15] <lericson> "squint at it boolishly"
[14:48:29] <deniska> it does call bool() on an object, but it evaluates to the object itself, not to what bool() returned
[14:49:11] <lericson> so if you could have numpy understand that arrays compare either universally or existentially quantified, you could have a < b c work
[14:49:21] <lericson> like a context manager that makes a < b actually a bool
[14:49:52] <lericson> or some kind of annotation, np.compares_all(arr) < b

Multi-GPU codepath. Multi-node, multi-gpu code path. And many within those.  I have an idea of storing values in sqlite and testing code paths against each other to make sure that the same inputs always return the same outputs no matter what code path.

[22:16:59] <no_gravity> If it is only the intantiation that is slow, then code that is like "hey, you probably need this only once, if not use imp" would be fine I guess.

[22:55:40] <philipp64|work> Hi. I’ve got a naive question about “global”.  If I have my main module, say “myapp.py” and it has “var = None” at the global scope, then that will be visible in functions inside that module.  However, if I have “mylib.py” that gets imported into “myapp.py”, and within “mylib.py” it does “libvar = None” globally… but then within my function libfunc() I do “libvar = json.load(…)” that seems to affect a *local*
[22:55:41] <philipp64|work> version of “libvar” in “libfunc()”… unless I preface the function with “global libvar” … my question, is “Why? Why isn’t it the same behavior in both places?”
[22:56:50] <nedbat> philipp64|work: being visible is different than assigning.  Assignment makes a name local to the function, unless "global" tells the compiler differently.
