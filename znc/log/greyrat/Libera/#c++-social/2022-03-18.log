[01:24:30] <T`aZ> 22:52 <Raziel> anyone, because template errors are made to cause people to rethink their life choices?
[01:24:43] <T`aZ> this should be part of a meme poster or something
[01:24:59] <Raziel> lol, for real though, why are they like this
[01:25:08] <Raziel> after a few you get used to where the fuck you're actually supposed to look to figure out what you did wrong, but
[01:25:36] <Raziel> anyone "new" to c++ would be stumped by that diarrhea of errors
[01:25:49] <T`aZ> i se the problem, you are expecting to master c++ after a few years
[01:25:59] <T`aZ> see*
[01:26:25] <T`aZ> where would be the fun without a diarrhea of errors?
[01:26:33] <Raziel> I'm not really expecting anything myself, nor do I have much of a problem with them, I'm just sayin they could perhaps be improved :p
[01:27:24] <T`aZ> ha, i see the problem, you are using gcc > 5 and yet still complaining about incomprehensible c++ error messages
[01:27:31] <Raziel> lol
[01:28:00] <Raziel> I usually use msvc myself, but don't worry, it's just as incomprehensible
[01:28:17] <T`aZ> you picked the best and hardest language of all time
[01:29:03] <Raziel> actually, gcc's error diarrhea is 197 lines long while msvc's is only 63
[01:29:12] <Raziel> so that's over three times better, I suppose.
[01:29:13] <Crocodillian> I vaguely read somewhere that c++20 does some things to improve the incomprehensible error situation with compilers
[01:29:16] <Crocodillian> like concepts etc.
[01:30:08] <Crocodillian> like you get an error about not satisfying a concept instead of some template gibberish
[01:30:42] <T`aZ> it's, not, gibberish
[01:30:50] <Raziel> Crocodillian, I've not seen that to be the case yet :p but it would be nice
[01:30:57] <T`aZ> but yes, concepts are easier to understand
[01:31:35] <T`aZ> not sure all the ctor are going to add the required concepts to *not* have gibberish errors though
[01:32:12] <T`aZ> s/ctor/template/
[01:32:53] <Raziel> it may not be a gibberish, but it's a lot of text that doesn't tell you where *your* problem is
[01:33:08] <T`aZ> but it does
[01:33:11] <T`aZ> really
[01:33:13] <Raziel> I don't need to see that xtree line 1034 is complaining, I need to see that main.cpp like 9 is complaining
[01:33:19] <T`aZ> for once, in your case, it does
[01:33:47] <T`aZ> you 'just' need to know the rules and filter out some stuffs
[01:34:01] <Crocodillian> I don't mind msvc, I use the new terminal with pscore and cmake and ninja and it's great
[01:34:03] <Raziel> I do :p but I can't be surprised if someone doesn't
[01:34:17] <Raziel> because it's a lot, and not obvious at first glance
[01:34:22] <Crocodillian> I only use VS ide for /debugexe
[01:35:01] <T`aZ> when you get parse arror at line 578; because you forgot a } at line 378, that is a 'wrong' error. not finding a required function or template substitution failure is isually less sever, even though it's less understandable for noobs
[01:35:23] <Raziel> like, just because I've C++'d enough to be able to filter and parse all of that crap, doesn't mean I can expect anyone else to be able to do so immediately
[01:35:48] <Crocodillian> supposedly clang gives nicer errors too
[01:35:52] <Raziel> I can look at it from the perspective of someone like that and say that it could be improved
[01:36:48] <T`aZ> yes, but you are underestimating the difficulty at outputing improved error messages, from the compiler point of view
[01:36:49] <Raziel> Crocodillian, less shit than gcc, slightly more shit than msvc
[01:37:12] <Raziel> T`aZ, I mean, I'm not because I'm not even considering it per se :p
[01:37:14] <T`aZ> this is really fucking difficult
[01:37:32] <Raziel> I'm just considering that a nicer result would be, well, nicer.
[01:38:03] <Raziel> I definitely don't have the skillz do make that better myself :p
[01:38:28] <Raziel> to*
[01:39:25] <T`aZ> you are in the middle of your grammar parsing, suddenly, something is not expected, and you cannot say 'char foo should not be there' , you have to say 'sfinae failed because the user is a moron, here, im kind, these are the template parameters in my context from 56 callstack earlier, because im still kind, i wont say go fuck yourself'
[01:40:22] <Raziel> right, but to someone who can't parse that, it probably does read as "go fuck yourself", even if there are good technical reasons for it not being simpler/clearer
[01:40:32] <T`aZ> concepts do improve because the type checking is done earlier
[01:40:48] <T`aZ> yes, we agree, reading error messages is hard
[01:41:08] <Raziel> C++ is the elden ring of programming languages :^)
[01:42:23] <Crocodillian> man gettext takes a long time to compile
[01:42:27] <Raziel> you go forward a bit, everything is polite, you're doing great, you decide to check out this cool looking thing you found, you died
[01:44:20] <T`aZ> s/died/does not compile/ , which is still 1000000000x better than failing at runtime in prod
[01:44:36] <Raziel> very true
[01:44:51] <Raziel> although there's many fun ways to shit on everything at runtime too :p
[01:45:16] <Crocodillian> by the way, you know if there's a colorgcc like thjing for msvc?
[01:45:48] <Raziel> Crocodillian, for visual studio proper? or for the output of msvc on an actual commandline?
[01:46:09] <Crocodillian> got ninja output in ps
[01:46:43] <Raziel> prooobably not, unless you wanna port https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NikolayBalakin.Outputenhancer to ps
[01:49:16] <Crocodillian> that doesn't even look as fancy as the color gcc output
[01:49:25] <Raziel> :(
[01:49:27] <Crocodillian> I can probably make a thing with some regex

[01:55:53] <Crocodillian> how the fuck do I tell gettext where the locale files are on windows
[01:57:57] <T`aZ> lol, i see the problem, you are expecting to use local on windows
[01:58:17] <Raziel> is "I see the problem" the newest meme? :p
[01:58:24] <T`aZ> im trying to
[01:58:59] <T`aZ> requires too much, so will fail like my previous attemps
[01:59:01] <T`aZ> +t
[01:59:08] <T`aZ> +work
[01:59:12] <T`aZ> i cant keyboard
[02:02:18] <Crocodillian> this may not even be implemented
[02:05:57] <Raziel> yeahhh, can't help you there. as someone who does try to aim for cross-compatibility between windows and linux, I tend to avoid any gnu libs like the plague. as well as anything else that starts their "how to build on windows" with "first, install mingw" or an equivalent thereof
[02:08:58] <Raziel> the base paradigms the two systems tend to use are just... too incompatible, most of the time, and forcing one on the other is never pleasant. find something made with crossplatform capability in mind in the first place v:
[02:15:42] <Crocodillian> lots of windows apps use gettext though
[02:16:45] <Crocodillian> btw a project I'm working on, got this in choco: https://github.com/rkitover/file-windows/releases
[02:19:13] <Raziel> I guess you can just give the absolute path to your stuff to bindtextdomain?
[02:19:43] <Raziel> at least as a stop gap, I imagine you'd want to use windows' equivalent for getting the current working directory normally?
[02:23:13] <Crocodillian> yeah I'll play with it, hopefully will get some help from the maints for this
[02:23:15] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[02:24:59] <Raziel> but yeah, gettext doesn't look that bad :p
[02:40:33] <Crocodillian> one thing I like about the windows ecosystem is that there's lots of interesting porting work to do
[02:41:05] <Crocodillian> and I get cmake and ninja with msvc
[02:43:52] <Crocodillian> I can use powershell with native tools like grep/sed/awk etc. from choco

[11:09:09] <jotham> hehe
[11:09:15] <jotham> got 'em
[11:10:02] <ERROH> i still don't get how your friends are pro putin
[11:10:20] <jotham> the libertarian one?
[11:10:24] <jotham> neither
[11:10:30] <jotham> since it seems to go against libertarianism
[11:10:44] <jotham> i think it's like the socialist campists?
[11:10:53] <jotham> except the libertarian version
[11:11:16] <jotham> as in, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_camp
[11:11:37] <jotham> the idea that the current order is utterly corrupt and a threat so enemy of my enemy is my friend
[11:12:11] <jotham> politics leads people to some bat shit positions
[11:14:39] <ERROH> ahh, so you meant just western 'left'
[11:14:54] <ERROH> or socialists rather
[11:15:25] <ERROH> our socialists are leaving international leftists organizations because they refuse to condemn putin
[11:15:48] <jotham> yeah it's weird fucking shit
[11:17:01] <Renderwww> so putin is a representative of the left?
[11:17:09] <Renderwww> stalin style?
[11:17:15] <jotham> haha
[11:17:29] <jotham> putin probably is similar to stalin in that he's the biggest bully in the yard
[11:17:41] <jotham> but putin didn't get sent to siberia twice for being a dickhead
[11:18:10] <jotham> a biography of stalin i read said stalin was basically obsessed with wolves until he died
[11:18:16] <jotham> because he had to deal with them in siberia all the time
[11:19:26] <T`aZ> rename to #daily_putin_topic
[11:19:48] <jotham> kia ora T`aZ, i invite you to propose a topic
[11:19:59] <jotham> it can't be how c++ isn't really portable
[11:20:05] <T`aZ> damn
[11:20:19] <Renderwww> but it is, if you use it like c!
[11:20:51] <T`aZ> about crappy earbuds
[11:21:09] <jotham> so i used to buy these $200 sennheiser earbuds for years
[11:21:09] <T`aZ> the cable where the plug is is already starting to be naked, it will break in some months i guess
[11:21:14] <T`aZ> they are not even 3yo
[11:21:18] <jotham> but they always died in 3-4 months cause of the cable or plug head
[11:21:27] <jotham> so i started trying all the shitty cheap earbud brands
[11:21:45] <jotham> and i have to say these ones are great, and i've used them for 2 years now, and i will be sad when they get discontinued, since everything nice always goes away
[11:22:00] <jotham> https://www.pbtech.co.nz/product/HSTPAN0125/Panasonic-HJE125E-Ergofit-In-Ear-Headphones---Blac
[11:22:03] <T`aZ> please name the brand
[11:22:08] <jotham> lots of the cheap earbuds are very bad, but these ones are great
[11:22:20] <jotham> and you can lay in bed watching tv say, and they don't hurt your ear, cause of the design
[11:22:27] <jotham> and cheap af
[11:22:36] <jotham> i have a box full of like 20 different brands of bad earbuds
[11:22:38] <jotham> before i found these ones
[11:22:40] <T`aZ> i also have very cheap, china style 2€ pairs, sounds like crap, but for 2€, cant do better i guess
[11:22:55] <jotham> i'd suggest trying these anyway, if you are in the market for cheap earbuds
[11:23:01] <jotham> and like i said, i came from nice expensive ones
[11:23:08] <jotham> and this is the best of the bad ones i found
[11:24:10] <Crocodillian> I have etymotics
[11:24:14] <Crocodillian> and a btr5
[11:24:23] <Crocodillian> balanced cable
[11:24:26] <T`aZ> ill be in the market soon indeed, i have proper headset at home, but for work, i need something lighter
[11:24:41] <Crocodillian> I recommend ^
[11:25:36] <Crocodillian> the first time you try etys it's like a warm feeling all through your body
[11:25:50] <T`aZ> kinky
[11:25:53] <jotham> hehe
[11:25:57] <jotham> i'll give them a go Crocodillian 
[11:26:03] <jotham> definitely sounds like a sex thing
[11:27:41] <Crocodillian> you can get er3xr, the er4 is not much better
[11:29:07] <T`aZ> another price range Crocodillian it seems
[11:29:32] <Crocodillian> these are studio quality IEMs
[11:29:45] <jotham> yeah we were talking about good cheap shit
[11:29:53] <jotham> not being wanked off by a billion dollar android
[11:30:26] <jotham> see: mother, in raised by wolves https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668fd125c1d937312ac60c1a6a43f6e1b7d39318/0_377_3629_2178/master/3629.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95e333544095f84be50f8a0be5859f13
[11:30:42] <T`aZ> yeah im not confy having 100€ pair to use everyday for work, can be easily forgotten somewhere or broken
[11:30:56] <jotham> my thinking is that earbuds take damage so often
[11:31:06] <jotham> pockets, cables getting caught, constant body motion etc
[11:31:11] <T`aZ> indeed
[11:31:11] <jotham> getting good cheap ones you replace periodically
[11:31:14] <jotham> is smarter than fancy ones
[11:31:22] <jotham> like my good headphones suffer way less day to day harm than my earbuds
[11:31:30] <Crocodillian> I wear the btr5 on a lanyard
[11:32:32] <Crocodillian> it's much more convenient than a wire connection to e.g. phone, and it pairs with multiple devices
[11:32:45] <T`aZ> i dont like wireless
[11:32:51] <jotham> neither
[11:32:54] <jotham> wireless is witchcraft
[11:33:02] <jotham> also sloppy and energy intensive
[11:33:05] <T`aZ> batteries, not free, not environment friendly
[11:33:08] <jotham> i've worked with bluetooth enough for a job
[11:33:12] <jotham> that i largely resent the entire thing

[11:33:29] <jotham> just give me a fucking strand of copper

[11:35:56] <T`aZ> have the same feeling, give me something that cannot break, with no maintenance, aka no software involved at all, no fucking moving parts, can i replace the motor by manual movement, i'll take that

[11:46:02] <T`aZ> i've had a moment when the music would not stop, you remove the contact key, shut everything, but the entertainment display would not shut down, kept playing. So I left it there, playing music alone in the car, bright lights etc
[11:46:05] <jotham> so i wondered if there was another layer to it
[11:46:42] <T`aZ> hopefully there is some kind of energy safety and the main computer shut it down after an hour or so, to not drain the battery i suppose

[12:47:57] <Faux> I think that's the (only) purpose of awk.

[12:49:21] <Faux> That's not right, but it's also not invalid.
[12:49:26] <jotham> i stand by my belief that generally if you are using awk you might want to just migrate the entire script into perl, python, nodejs, whatever
[12:49:31] <Faux> (echo 5 4; echo 2 1) | awk 'BEGIN { $i=0 } { $i += $2 } END { print $i }'
[12:50:20] <Faux> Yeah, but for that usecase, both python and node is infuriatingly bad and I don't know perl.

[13:59:15] <Carbonflux> forth is a brilliant language, you can do anything with, even get it to write its own forth.

[13:59:24] <jotham> taught me a lot of math and a lot of reality about hardware
[14:02:40] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: what amazes me is that you can write a firmware for a complex robot in a 4k image that includes the compiler and runtime

[14:03:47] <Carbonflux> ya, after all it was originally invented to control telescopes.
[14:04:20] <Carbonflux> but at the same time you can use it for AI, in effect you could implement LISP with it.
[14:05:38] <Carbonflux> i remember that in the early days "writing your own forth" was a rite of passage.
[14:05:48] <Crocodillian> nice
[14:06:28] <Carbonflux> of course that meant that it was unmaintainable by "modern" standards heh.

[20:51:49] <Crocodillian> in that they attack your neurons, particularly smell neurons and possibly others depending on the person
