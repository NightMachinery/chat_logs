[17:39:06] <m455> https://yewtu.be/watch?v=AnMaJm8ieYg
[17:39:11] <m455> you're welcome, chicken
[17:42:57] <mario-goulart> Amazing.  Thanks m455 
[17:43:02] <m455> :D
[17:43:47] <m455> my dad used to play that song in his car when i was a good, good memories lol
[17:44:05] <mario-goulart> Sounds too good to be recorded in 64.  I wonder if the info is correct.
[17:44:48] <m455> taht was around the time he was doing stuff, so i wouldnt be surprised
[17:45:25] <m455> it's jsut a mic near a guitar and he would wear dress shoes so he could tap his feet to add some percussoin, so it wouldnt be hard to capture the sound!
[17:46:36] <m455> also, if you put a mic right by the 12th fret of a guitar, you get a good acoustic sound and vocals. good trick if you ever wanna do some cell phone recordings :D
[17:48:38] <mario-goulart> I always assumed the best trick get a good audio recording with a phone was by not using one.
[17:49:19] <m455> hahahah you would think! xD phones get some pretty good quality out if you place them right :D
[17:49:24] <m455> brbbbb baby woke up haha
