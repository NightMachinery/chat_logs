[19:27:58] <bn_work> anyone here familiar with saltstack?
[19:31:29] <dodo> you probably want #salt
[19:31:54] <rawtaz> who does?
[19:32:18] <rawtaz> im pondering using salt instead of ansible, woulld that be a bad idea?
[19:33:16] <dodo> every time i use ansible i ask myself.. why am i not using salt..
[19:33:52] <rawtaz> haha whats the stuff you dislike about it?
[19:33:54] <dodo> bn_work just had a good question in #salt that gives one reason why.. ansible crams logic into yaml.. which makes zero sense
[19:34:17] <dodo> i also dislike how inventory is managed, and the ad hoc commands, so much easier with salt
[19:34:19] <rawtaz> well, nothing of this type makes sense as long as its not declarative
[19:34:24] <rawtaz> ok
[19:34:44] <rawtaz> but salt doesnt have a proper push mode does it? so its like if you want to pull salt is the main contender, if you want to push ansible is the main one
[19:34:47] <dodo> i mean, i think using both is actually fine, i just do the heavy lifting with salt
[19:35:13] <dodo> push mode, you mean like ssh/scp stuff to the hosts and run? it has salt-ssh
[19:35:31] <rawtaz> i mean that you push config to the node instead of the node contacting some server to pull it
[19:35:40] <rawtaz> with ansible thats done using ssh yes
[19:35:53] <dodo> yeah, salt can do that
[19:36:10] <dodo> ansible can also handle devices that can't run the minion/agent, not sure if salt-ssh can work as well as that
[19:36:14] <rawtaz> i hope it works beter now than a few years when i last tried it, it was buggy af and didnt work at all. but it was a long time ago
[19:36:16] <dodo> i've never managed network infra and such
[19:36:29] <dodo> you mean salt-ssh?
[19:36:46] <rawtaz> yeah thats nice. i think a tool like this shouldnt need anything but a tiny tiny agent. preferrably it should just be written in Go instead of python and shit :)
[19:36:53] <rawtaz> yeah i think it was salt-ssh
[19:37:14] <dodo> for me python is a bonus as i know it and can extend salt ;)
[19:37:41] <rawtaz> yeah its just horrible that you need more than one single little binary
[19:37:49] <rawtaz> but it is what it is
[19:43:52] <dodo> hehe, i even run salt on my tiny arm machines at home <3
[19:43:53] <bn_work> dodo:  I'm currently trying to decide between salt, chef, and cfengine.  reqs are low dependencies, native windows (bonus: other platforms too) support, some sort of dashboard, and ease of writing/debugging in non-template language
[19:44:10] <rawtaz> :)
[19:44:33] <dodo> bn_work: i haven't worked with either chef or cfengine
[19:44:59] <bn_work> most of the machines are Linux but unfortunately we are stuck with some Windows boxes that I try to stay away from
[19:45:24] <bn_work> monitoring + integration with popular cloud services (ex: Linode + AWS) would also be nice
[19:45:30] <dodo> oh, and not with windows either, but i believe salt has some windows support
[19:45:46] <dodo> mh, what would that integration do?
[19:46:22] <bn_work> dodo:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_configuration_management_software shows a "√" for Windows for Salt, with no footnote- which I was hoping meant no caveats :)

[19:47:50] <bn_work> dodo:  dunno, perhaps allow one to use the native AWS / Linode APIs to provision/deprovision, monitor, etc.
[19:48:02] <bn_work> it's not a hard req but would be a "nice-to-have"
[19:48:23] <bn_work> I did see salt has an integration with Splunk for ex
[19:48:30] <dodo> salt has salt-cloud, i've used that a few years ago. but handling infra is not really a config management job, imo
[19:48:41] <dodo> oh? didn't know that
[19:51:20] <bn_work> hmm, no real IRC channel for chef? :/  
[19:51:27] <bn_work> https://netsplit.de/channels/?chat=chef
[19:51:41] <bn_work> guess, that scratches chef out
[19:52:43] <bn_work> (I guess I should add IRC channel to the list of soft reqs but I guess not everyone tries to have a channel for that :)  )
[20:02:55] <bn_work> dodo:  so you run multiple engines in parallel?  does that work ... well?  
[20:04:27] <dodo> i just have ansible as a backup for emergencies
[20:16:32] <bn_work> dodo:  the two can be running simultaneously and not interfere with each other?  or I guess it's agentless so they don't interfere?
