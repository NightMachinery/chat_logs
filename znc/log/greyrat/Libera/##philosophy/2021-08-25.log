[10:17:46] <arcturus> the youth is being corrupted now more than ever
[10:20:17] <Samian> you know what's nuts? Socrates was 71 when he was killed!! 71 in 400BC is incredibly impressive!!!
[10:20:32] <Samian> most people died at 40 or 50 years old during those days

[19:46:03] <Populus> Segregating porn successively until it ends up on a purely pornographic website. Makes sense to me.
[19:46:36] <pussipupu> I lived on leaves when there weren't any shops, but I'd rather have a bowl of Coco-pops!
[19:47:11] <pussipupu> or the variant from my school days: I lived on leaves but they weren't very nice, and I'd rather have a bowl of curry and rice!
[19:47:50] <Populus> Oh I read that article the other way around, because I remembered they were banning porn.
[19:51:17] <pussipupu> Honestly I don't know exactly what Onlyfans is, but I thought it was Patreon for porn
[19:51:18] <pussipupu> not that there's zero porn on Patreon
[19:52:42] <Populus> I just logged on just now to see what it is like. It's exactly like Twitter but for people who want to showcase their bodies, sometimes for money.

[20:39:21] <mrdata> i never believed OnlyFans would ban explicit material, only that they strengthened identity verification requirements

[21:17:34] <TechTest> onlyfans is about explicit material only
[21:18:06] <TechTest> if they ban explicit content they pretty much ban onlyfans all together

[21:40:34] <kmh> pussipupu,  that's what the wikipedia description says more or less
[21:41:17] <kmh> TechTest,  well they may kill their main revenue stream
[21:41:50] <kmh> TechTest, however as i understood it they probably only kill hardcore content
[21:42:29] <kmh> meaning soft pornographic and erotica material will continue and probably create enough revenue
[21:42:56] <kmh> at least i suspect that's what they are counting/gambling on
