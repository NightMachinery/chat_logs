[03:37:09] <azzamsa> I am stuck getting emacs version from terminal. I need it for someting like neofectch. I have tried `emacs -q  --funcall="version" --batch`, `emacs --eval="(version)" --batch`. and other variation with/without quotes. It produces nothing. However, if I make a mistakes in the args. I print the `Debugger entered--Lisp error:`. But it produces nothing

[03:54:06] <edrx> ppl, what do you use to create anchors in your files and to have links-ish things that point to those anchors? Eev includes support for the method that I've been using since the late 90, but I'd like to put in the docs some references the other ways to do that...
[03:54:25] <edrx> in eev once you declare - using a syntax that some people hate - that "dn6" refers to ~/LATEX/dednat6/ then the effect of a sexp like (find-dn6 "stacks.lua" "Stack-tests") is: open the file ~/LATEX/dednat6/stacks.lua and search for the first occurrence of the string «Stack-tests» in it.
[03:54:35] <edrx> and I use glyphs to make "«" and "»" always be displayed in green.
[03:54:57] <edrx> (btw: in all the times that I tried to learn Org I got stuck, and gave up, before learning the Org way to do something like this)

[03:59:12] <perrierjouet> is it because python was less difficult to master for non programmers ?

[03:59:28] *** Joins: koffeinfriedhof (~koffeinfr@ubuntuusers/moderation/koffeinfriedhof)
[03:59:58] <bremner> perrierjouet: IMHO because lisp doesn't have as good libraries
[04:00:36] <bremner> common-lisp is a bit archaic, and doesn't have good third party libraries, and scheme mostly has libraries for making scheme compilers
[04:00:49] <bremner> (possibly unpopular opinions)
[04:01:14] <edrx> is it because the people who developed Python spent a huge fortune trying to understand how non-programmers think?

[04:03:07] <bremner> johnjay: well, I have recently been fighting with the common lisp path library, and it is both weak on features and ridiculously over general, supporting many kinds of OS that no longer matter to me, like VMS
[04:03:17] <technomancy> maybe it's because lisp programmers refuse to use such a redundant term as "data science"

[04:04:48] <johnjay> and lisp has the 80% problem as well. lisp being so good people just kind of hack together the 80% solution instead of making a library and debugging it rigorously

[04:07:45] <technomancy> johnjay: well like ... the idea that TCP sockets were going to "win" over the competition was still somewhat up in the air when the standard was created, as one example

[15:24:27] <pingpongball> systemd or not systemd
[15:24:45] <yeti> I'd prefer systemE

[15:25:45] <pingpongball> have you heard of sysvinit
[15:26:05] <pingpongball> while i was in debian i used to use just systemctl .config/systemd/emacs.service

[15:26:14] <yeti> I dropped devuan because they still think arm systems doint deserve kernel updates

[15:27:26] <pingpongball> please tell me how can i run debian server on startup?
[15:27:37] <yeti> I'd out that into the user's crontab

[19:45:39] <acdw> well, avy. i don't think there's a mode
[19:45:40] <johnjay> it basically lets you jump to anywhere on screen with letter codes
[19:45:54] <johnjay> i wrote some elisp a while back to copy and insert at point from it

[19:46:37] <acdw> i would use existing stuff i think
[19:46:42] <johnjay> hmm
[19:46:44] <johnjay> why though
[19:46:53] <johnjay> isn't the whole point of avy to do stuff with 1 or 2 keys

[19:51:19] <rpav> ;)
[19:51:23] <johnjay> so am i correct if you guys need to copy a variable name or symbol you either navigate to it with the mouse or just C-s it?
[19:51:48] <rpav> i generally type a few chars and hit tab
[19:51:57] <rpav> why navigate

[20:36:27] <johnjay> Catie: maybe space as a dead key would be a good idea
[20:36:30] <grym> the problem is that i already use things in my thumb cluster... 
[20:36:41] <johnjay> emacs keymaps make this relatively easy. space twice for an actual space. then space once for a new keymap

[20:36:49] <grym> i bet it's never

[21:24:01] <bpalmer> but you can do something like in after-change-functions , if it's an insertion, just incrmeent the counter if need be (looking at where it was inserted and spaces around it); if not, schedule a full recount of the entire buffer.

[23:31:53] <rdrg109> aindilis: I learned how Wikidata handles symmetric relations: by accepting redundancy. "Linus Torvalds" has "spouse" equal to "Tove Torvalds" and "Tove Torvalds" has "spouse" equal to "Linus Toralds"

[23:56:09] <bremner> uh, some tab thingy?
[23:56:30] <bremner> dunno, there must be some reason the kids keep using pre-release versions
[23:57:08] <acdw> we use arch btw
[23:57:27] <bremner> Gaudi, is that you?
[23:58:04] <turbofail> rudybot: tab thingy?
[23:58:05] <rudybot> turbofail: Ideally, company should just pop up a selection menu, remove it and provide in-line expansion, and drop that, too, if you type normally. Only on TAB it should expand. Whether up/down or only M-p/m-n should select in the pop-up thingy is a bit subjective I guess.
