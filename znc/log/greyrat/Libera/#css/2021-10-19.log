[02:30:45] <hmw[at]> Did you see what I changed?
[02:32:11] <hmw[at]> 2 changes in the CSS. I used line-height instead of height, and vertical-align:middle; to center it
[02:32:12] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/3w4zq8r9/
[02:32:17] <hmw[at]> craigbass76: ^
[02:32:41] <hmw[at]> aaand I indented the wrong line :)
[02:32:46] <craigbass76> Padding?
[02:33:04] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/3w4zq8r9/1/
[02:33:15] <hmw[at]> no, I just went straight to using line height basically
[02:34:02] <hmw[at]> with that and vertical-align:middle; you get the desired effect. I just hope it will not mess with other things in your actual page :) Could happen.
[02:34:31] <craigbass76> I knew it would be easy. One of those "Stared at it a while today and banged my head on the desk" situations. Same thing happened the other day in a PHP script with a misspelled variable.
[02:35:09] <hmw[at]> You might also want to check out flexbox I think
[02:36:10] <hmw[at]> Havent't really gotten to practice it yet, so I am not good with it, but I think other people here might suggest it too. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

[02:50:51] <hmw[at]> *all of those, I did pick up
[02:51:05] <FunkyBob> I hate the way 'factoids' has become the common term for factlets...
[02:51:47] <hmw[at]> I never heard that word. I thought everyone calls bot commands like these factoids. Can you elaborate on my mistake?

[02:52:45] <FunkyBob> the -oid suffix means "resembling" or "like"

[03:05:54] <ningu> is there a way to have something absolutely positioned in the top right of a container, and have container content flow around it?
[03:06:01] <ningu> do I need a float for this? hopefully not...
[03:07:15] <hmw[at]>  Not really. You can do some trickery with child elements that stick out of a parent though.
[03:08:00] <hmw[at]> <parent position:relative"><child position:absolute; right:-10px;>...
[03:08:11] <ningu> ah yeah
[03:08:23] <ningu> I think I've done stuff like that before
[03:08:49] <ningu> basically this is <ul> and I want a couple icons in the top right of the container and some of the <li> elements might be long and might run into it
[03:08:58] <ningu> but yeah your way might be best
[03:11:23] <ningu> hmm... might be some sort of clever trick I can do with flexbox and the order proprety
[03:11:30] <ningu> to at least get something better than what I have now
[03:12:21] <hmw[at]> ningu: https://jsfiddle.net/qjumtdk0/ <-- make it float outside adjusting to size, touching parent to the left
[03:14:30] <ningu> huh, I see
[03:15:11] <ningu> why outline instead of border by the way?
[03:15:32] <hmw[at]> better visiblity only

[03:16:42] <ningu> ah I see, just read the difference, cool. had no idea outline existed

[03:18:29] <craigbass76> Selvvir: I found jsfiddle, googling while I was waiting for an answer and remembered using it before. I was thinking pastebin, but it doesn't give you that preview. I'm surprised they haven't built that in over the years...
[03:19:32] <hmw[at]> pastebin is cancer anyways. I'd recommend the debian paste for pure text (but not in this channel, we prefer live examples so we can inspect)
[03:19:48] <hmw[at]> craigbass76: did you see my post?
[03:20:57] <hmw[at]> ningu: Outlines will NOT push things away from the element, like a border would, though. It can overlap stuff on the outside of the box. It is used to indicate the focussed element by the browser, too.
[03:21:28] <ningu> yeah, seems useful, just didn't know about it
[03:21:48] <hmw[at]> it is also outside of the border, so you get to make your border in 2 colors so to say
[03:22:05] <hmw[at]> i think border-radius doesn't work with the outlines
[03:22:17] <hmw[at]> (always a rect)
[03:22:50] <hmw[at]> Avoid destroying the focussed element indication of the browser, for good UX
[03:22:58] <craigbass76> hmw[at]: I did. It's all fixed now. Thank you, kind person.

[04:05:55] <ningu> hmw[at]: generally speaking, what are some ways to have content wrap around a container positioned in the corner of the parent like I was describing above?
[04:06:18] <ningu> is it generally not possible no matter how you lay out the html and write the css?
[04:06:42] <hmw[at]> there is some css thing that allows you to let text flow around images, even if they are not rectangular. That sound good, I can try to find it
[04:06:57] <hmw[at]> besides that, there would be the classic float
[04:07:17] <ningu> yeah

[04:15:35] <ningu> I think regular float may be adequate for this
[04:15:38] <FunkyBob> i mean, it _sounds_ like you want float... so why doin't you want float?
[04:16:00] <ningu> FunkyBob: I tried float and it didn't behave as I expected but I realized why and just re-did it. I think it's fine
[04:16:17] <FunkyBob> ok
[04:16:53] <ningu> I assume with a floated element, the margins around it are just whatever its normal margins are?
[04:17:37] <hmw[at]> Floats are a little odd with margins. I recommend reading up on the specifics or do some testing
[04:17:41] <ningu> ok

[21:13:14] <devslash> ok so then I have a question about thi
[21:13:16] <devslash> this
[21:13:17] <hmw[at]> Is there another?
[21:13:59] <devslash> I am inspecting my site and am trying to add overflow:scroll starting at body and working through the dom but I cannot figure out where to add this css to allow the content to scroll.
[21:14:13] <devslash> i am live testing it on my mobile device from Firefox on my PC
[21:14:46] <devslash> I mean I am inspecting the DOM on my pc from my web site running on Firefox Mobile on Android which is where I am having this problem
[21:14:49] <hmw[at]> devslash: Question should be, why DOESN'T your content scroll. Scrolling is default
[21:15:03] <devslash> i dont know...
[21:15:07] <hmw[at]> hmm
[21:15:21] <hmw[at]> Give me a minute, I just started making Coffee. I'll be with you shortly
[21:15:29] <devslash> I am using Ionic which is a library for rapid development with angular
[21:15:32] <devslash> ok thanks
[21:17:48] <hmw[at]> I have zero experienc with such frameworks, so I might miss something others might know, but still, your problem sounds quite wieird
[21:18:05] <devslash> well the framework is not exactly the issue
[21:18:05] <hmw[at]> One possibility to disable scrolling can be position:absolute
[21:18:15] <devslash> at the end of the day, the page still builds a dom
[21:18:20] <devslash> oh ok
[21:18:22] <devslash> let me check
[21:18:48] <hmw[at]> devslash: I don't think so either, it's CSS after all, but you might be using some specific classes or gadgedts others might immediately identify as potential problem
[21:19:50] <devslash> well you can always use !important to override any built in CSS right
[21:21:00] <hmw[at]> that's not a perfect method. I barely ever use !important. I prefer to use good old specificity over it. Less hassle overall in my experience
[21:21:18] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@181-163-32-147.baf.movistar.cl)

[21:21:54] <devslash> sure

[22:18:35] <hmw[at]> hassoon: They don't want to post the link publicly. On the mobile browser, the main area of the page does not get scroll bars
[22:19:18] <hmw[at]> devslash: I recommend you let hassoon take a look.
[22:19:39] <hmw[at]> hassoon: Good morning!
[22:19:56] <devslash> hassoon, can i send you the link in a pm ?
[22:22:36] <hassoon> devslash: this is a trusted support channel you can post your links safely, people here are meant to offer help
[22:23:02] <devslash> hassoon, I developed a website using the Ionic framework in Angular. I am live testing it on Firefox mobile on my android phone while connect to my pc and am inspecting the DOM on my pc and manipulating it. Ionic does add a lot of CSS but i  am trying to force scrollbars so you can scroll vertically and horizontally but despite adding overflow: scroll to the dom element, it doesnt show any scrollbars
[22:23:39] <hassoon> devslash: alright, we need to see the website so we start diagnosing the use case
[22:23:55] <devslash> Im not comfortable pasting the link here
[22:24:04] <hassoon> alright then, pm it as you said
[22:25:06] <devslash> sent.. if you can, please view it on mobile, preferrably on chrome or FF
[22:26:04] <hmw[at]> on iOS you only get safary anyways, right?
[22:26:15] <devslash> no
[22:26:17] <hmw[at]> safari*
[22:26:20] <devslash> you can download FF on ios
[22:26:29] <devslash> but it uses the webkit engine
[22:26:44] <devslash> since thats the only web browser engine that apple allows you to use
[22:27:01] <hassoon> hmw[at]: hi there
[22:27:01] <hmw[at]> I installed all browsers I could find on an older iPhone I use for testing. It was always safari (was working on a WebRTC VoIP app). Is it different with more up-to-date iPhones?
[22:27:10] <hmw[at]> Good morning again
[22:27:20] <devslash> well there are other options...
[22:27:40] <hassoon> devslash: you want the tabke to be scrollable horizontally and vertically ?
[22:27:46] <devslash> yes
[22:28:22] <hmw[at]> I'd really like the option to have a proper FF or Chrome on mobiles. Ototh, nobody is going to install a browser for my chat anyways. People can't even handle mutliple tabs on their phones :/ I think, I will have to write a proper app. Also, the websocket dies, as soon as I turn off the display
[22:28:39] <hassoon> devslash: the idea here consists of setting a min-height and min-width for the table, and make its parent scrollable
[22:28:42] <hmw[at]> It seems rather futile to try and make apps for a phone via web page
[22:28:45] <devslash> the real problem is that Apple has total control and are super strict about many things
[22:28:57] <devslash> its not via a web page by the way
[22:29:05] <hmw[at]> My chat is
[22:29:11] <hassoon> devslash: how many visible rows should the table contain at most ?
[22:29:14] <devslash> oh I meant the framework
[22:29:28] <devslash> its going to be a growing list
[22:29:36] <hassoon> devslash: and what's the min-width and the min-height you want the table to have before it gets scrollable if the screen size is smaller than min-height or min-width ?
[22:29:41] <devslash> i just want to be able to scroll to the end
[22:29:41] <hmw[at]> it is 4 rows at the moment, right?
[22:29:46] <devslash> yea
[22:29:52] <devslash> but there will be a lot more

[22:30:13] <devslash> hassoon, im not sure
[22:30:35] <devslash> i dont want to have to specify a size in px because i want it to be fleible for all devices
[22:30:52] <devslash> not just the device that I am testing out my site on
[22:30:56] <hassoon> devslash: the approach is bazed on min sizing
[22:31:03] <hassoon> devslash: there is no other method for that
[22:31:33] <devslash> ok
[22:31:36] <hassoon> devslash: unless you want some decent javascript logic that should take care of that and make the table scrollable when the content starts getting cut/hidden
[22:31:58] <devslash> well dont you usually just use CSS for that
[22:32:18] <devslash> I mean using JS almost reminds me of jquery hacks that I use to use back in the day
[22:32:25] <hassoon> devslash: so heey, you need to tell me the max visible rows in the table, and the max width for it before it gets scrollable horizontaly
[22:32:35] <devslash> 5 rows
[22:32:43] <devslash> 150px; with
[22:33:04] <hassoon> devslash: 150px width for one column ?
[22:33:08] <hassoon> or all the table ?
[22:33:11] <devslash> oh per column ?
[22:33:17] <devslash> per list item
[22:33:29] <hassoon> devslash: nope, the whole set of columns
[22:33:37] <hassoon> that makes it the whole table's width
[22:34:01] <devslash> yea
[22:34:22] <devslash> im giving you an estimate. Ill adjust it as needed
[22:34:47] <hmw[at]> devslash: One doesn't need JS for things like enabling scrolling when the list gets longer. You are totally right about that.

[23:49:20] <hassoon> countless nested shadow root doms...what the heck
[23:49:25] <devslash> this is angular code
[23:49:34] <hassoon> devslash: not ionic elements
[23:49:37] <hassoon> i mean just angular
[23:49:41] <hassoon> usind the BrowserModule
[23:49:42] <devslash> ionic is a multi platform framework that you can use with react or angular
[23:49:45] <hassoon> using *
[23:50:00] <hassoon> meh ionic my ass
[23:50:05] <devslash> the reason im using ionic is because you can build your app for we, android and ios with the same code base
[23:50:14] <devslash> *web
[23:50:17] <hassoon> devslash: look at that joke https://i.imgur.com/gCuaJmi.png
[23:50:39] <hassoon> devslash: if i were you i'd just use the angular framework, it's alone enough and pretty perfect for both mobile and desktop apps

[23:52:10] <devslash> well I really think that is worth using ionic for the multi platform advantage
[23:52:27] <devslash> it creates native mobile apps which I really like
[23:52:28] <hassoon> angular aline by itself is multi plateform
[23:52:42] <hassoon> * angular alone by itself is multi plateform compatile
[23:52:44] <devslash> yes but it doesnt let you build android/ios apps
[23:52:47] <hassoon> * compatible
[23:52:48] <hassoon> ffs
[23:53:00] <hassoon> android/ios are mobile apps
[23:53:09] <devslash> I know
[23:53:14] <hassoon> and that goes under the umbrella of the multiplateform feature of angular
[23:53:29] <hassoon> anyway whatever works better for you
[23:53:30] <devslash> but natively it doesnt support that
[23:58:48] <hmw[at]> If you're using html/css it is not native
[23:58:51] <hassoon> devslash: anyway g'luck, you might want to lool up this mobile issue with your table's colums alignement
