[02:33:36] <rawktucc> see, so easy right
[02:34:38] <moo> think there are some limits? i'm at 66 GB dl
[02:35:03] <rawktucc> I'm at 3.2TB
[02:35:09] <rawktucc> only limit is your storage capacity
[02:35:12] <moo> i mean daily etc
[02:35:19] <rawktucc> never seen any daily limits
[02:35:28] <rawktucc> I pulled over 100GB the other day, before stopping because I realized maybe I didnt like the channel
[02:35:29] <moo> great
[02:35:34] <moo> haha
[02:35:42] <moo> youtube wants me to pay to get rid of ads? MY ASS
[02:35:54] <moo> instead i'll pummel their servers
[02:37:16] <Hawker> what tool do you use? bc youtube-dl has been downloading at dial up internet speeds for me lately
[02:37:24] <moo> yt-dlp 
[02:38:07] <moo> https://i.imgur.com/kohMAnz.png jellyfin even magically finds metadata to it and makes thumbnails :D
[02:39:41] <moo> also 60TB free in new rig, youtube can be afraid =D
[02:44:06] <rawktucc> Hawker, yt-dlp and use --concurrent-fragments 8 or 16
[02:44:19] <rawktucc> or optionally --external-downloader aria2c --external-downloader-args "-x 16 -s 16"
[02:44:27] <rawktucc> can use both together
[02:44:32] <rawktucc> moo :D
[02:44:48] <rawktucc> moo, my config I send you adds metadata to the final video file :)
[02:44:57] <rawktucc> so it's probably reading it from there. sort of magic but just easy
[02:45:03] <moo> ohh i see. great!
[02:45:09] <rawktucc> and yeah may want to modify to change webm to mp4, in the -f line
[02:45:12] <rawktucc> if you have trouble playing vp9
[02:45:13] <Hawker> why rawktucc, what do they do?
[02:45:27] <moo> vp9 is fine
[02:45:27] <rawktucc> Hawker, yt-dlp is an updated version of youtube-dl, and it's maintained, so it has fixes
[02:45:45] <rawktucc> concurrent-fragments downloads however many fragments of a fragmented video at the same time, so using as much bandwidth as possible
[02:46:13] *** Joins: Sgeo (~Sgeo@user/sgeo)
[02:46:30] <rawktucc> aria2c and -x 16 -s 16 will use aria2c, super fast multi-segment file downloader, and will open 16 connections per server and 16 connections per file
[02:46:37] <rawktucc> basically, you're telling yt-dlp to actually go fast
[02:46:43] <rawktucc> the concurrent-fragments alone will benefit you
[02:46:53] <Hawker> awesome
[02:47:02] <rawktucc> don't feel bad about going fast from google. they're a gigantic company with terabits of bandwidth at their disposal
[02:47:06] <rawktucc> youtube will die someday
[02:47:13] <Hawker> rawktucc, idgaf about google
[02:47:17] <rawktucc> :D
[02:47:34] <Hawker> Also do you know of a way to download from the streaming site nebula?
[02:47:50] <rawktucc> what's nebula?
[02:48:07] <rawktucc> does yt-dlp support other streaming sites?
[02:48:23] <moo> youtube-dl supported like 50 sites so probably
[02:48:34] <rawktucc> wtf really??????
[02:48:42] <moo> unless they cut off less popular sites to save on dev times?
[02:48:45] <moo> and maintenance

[02:49:41] <rawktucc> this is TIL
[02:50:02] <rawktucc> i guess you just youtube-dl the nebula video
[02:50:27] <Hawker> fk yea
[02:50:42] <Hawker> Also is it available via apt? I don't see it
[02:50:59] <moo> even if it is, don't
[02:51:02] <moo> pip3 install yt-dlp
[02:51:10] <Hawker> oh, via python?
[02:51:12] <Hawker> mmk
[02:51:16] <rawktucc> Hawker, no
[02:51:38] <Hawker> I meant via pip
[02:51:54] <moo> or git if you're feeling fancy

[02:52:06] <rawktucc> ooh wait
[02:52:12] <rawktucc> doesn't fix $PATH
[02:52:16] <Hawker> python and pip... synonymous in my mind, I've always seen it as python's personal package manager
[02:52:31] <rawktucc> can use it through pip though but I would recommend the standalone executable
[02:52:55] <moo> so what channels are you downloading? 
[02:53:14] <moo> scishow, scishow space, veritasium, kurzgesagt - so far for me, my most watched and sometimes rewatched =D
[02:53:38] <rawktucc> ah a lot
[02:53:51] <rawktucc> i have channels that I dont think exist anymore
[02:54:08] <moo> hah meat
[02:54:09] <moo> neat
[02:54:15] <rawktucc> a lot of ASMR tbh
[02:54:20] <Hawker> wait so how do I invoke it if I install via pip?
[02:54:25] <rawktucc> i am lonely and it's comforting :(
[02:54:29] <rawktucc> Hawker, probably pip yt-dlp?
[02:54:34] <rawktucc> or python yt-dlp
[02:54:40] <rawktucc> no actually it should just be yt-dlp
[02:54:45] <moo> nah it just installs executable
[02:54:48] <moo> yes
[02:54:49] <rawktucc> ^^^^^^^
[02:55:02] <Hawker> just yt-dlp?
[02:55:08] <Hawker> bc it doesn't work
[02:55:12] <rawktucc> :(
[02:55:19] <rawktucc> so you did pip install yt-dlp and no good?
[02:56:00] <moo> usually it installs in /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
[02:56:01] <Hawker> pip3 install yt-dlp
[02:56:04] <moo> but depends on distro probably
[02:56:17] <moo> on my centos VM its there
[02:56:29] <evilgohan2> pip install yt-dlp? That's a thing?
[02:56:42] <moo> it must be python3 and yes
[02:56:54] <evilgohan2> sorry, I'm just used to it being in the fedora repo
[02:57:06] <Hawker> yt-dlp in ./.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages (2021.12.1)

[03:02:38] <sarnold> all gas no brakes was good stuff, yeah
[03:02:45] <moo> also i now need neural network to remove fucking nordvpn recommendations from videos
[03:02:55] <sarnold> I'm finding channel 5 is hit or miss, but it's probably best their out from the old owner

[03:03:18] <sarnold> moo: https://sponsor.ajay.app/about/
[03:03:36] <moo> hah yea but my biggest problem is when i want to watch on tv
[03:03:36] <sarnold> I've never actually used sponsorblock since 99% of my youtibe is done on a chromecast.. but it's a brilliant idea
[03:03:52] <rawktucc> apparently mpv has a plugin for sponsorblock, if you're watching local downloaded videos
[03:04:04] <rawktucc> I may have that wrong but I think that's insane you can skip sponsorships even with local copies of videos
[03:04:07] <Hawker> I installed it via pip, had to build it from the lastest to find the binary in ~/.local/bin and it still didn't run so I simply moved it to /bin
[03:04:10] <rawktucc> it's REALLY annoying with ASMR videos
[03:04:27] <rawktucc> Hawker, should add ~/.local/bin to $PATH if it's not there yet
[03:04:31] <rawktucc> or grab the prebuilt from their site
[03:04:51] <rawktucc> sarnold, channel 5 definitely as good as all gas but yes better they cut that cord
[03:05:15] <rawktucc> the talledaga video they did was funny, they got kicked out of the press area for asking about piss too much
[03:05:28] <sarnold> rawktucc: I gave up on the "twins" video, whatever that was, and the pickup artists video just meh imho..
[03:05:45] <rawktucc> the pickup one was cringe, the twins was weird and also in SD only? weird artistic choice
[03:05:50] <sarnold> rawktucc: but that dude asking people for reparations was just awesome

[03:18:58] <rawktucc> btw archiving tiktok with yt-dlp just needs cookies from tiktok's website. you dont even need to login, just browse the site
[03:19:06] <sarnold> I skimmed yours and you and I have very little overlap, so I'm not sure :) but technology connections feels like it might work for you

[19:55:37] <joepie91> am not
[19:58:41] <ThePendulum> cool
[19:58:51] <ThePendulum> I didn't the previous years but I quite like it
[19:59:14] <ThePendulum> don't think I've written this much horrible JS in my life though
[20:03:02] <moo> rawktucc vp9 is the native high-res on yt no?
[20:03:06] <moo> so what are you switching to 
[20:03:57] <ThePendulum> apparently password authentication was set to 'no' in sshd_config on my pi, not sure if that happened during an update or some auto config
[20:04:44] <rawktucc> moo, switching to h264
[20:05:00] <moo> oh derp right. but isn't that going to reencode vp9 to h264?
[20:05:11] <rawktucc> nope there are h264 streams along with vp9 streams
[20:05:14] <rawktucc> vp9 is native for high res but im pretty sure there's 4k streams in h264
[20:05:35] <moo> hm i see
[20:05:59] <ThePendulum> oh, no, that was not it either. wtf.
