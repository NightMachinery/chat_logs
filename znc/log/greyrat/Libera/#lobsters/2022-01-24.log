[01:25:16] <iDrougge> We will need a Copilot detection service when doing interviews.
[01:28:49] <banna> this does not spark joy
[01:30:56] <c355E3B> Just ask questions you can't use copilot for
[01:32:22] <banna> there has always been a recurring attempt at "personal assistant"-like software tools
[01:32:30] <banna> I never understood it.
[01:32:35] <banna> (see: clippy)
[01:35:40] <c355E3B> Its one of those areas of human interaction design that if you get it *right* is magic
[01:35:46] <c355E3B> but we are really bad at making the general case work
[01:39:03] <banna> I see the need for automation to be deployed for large systems, and have some level of autonomous control over certain bits. But for an individual human? It would seem to me that such a relationship would only foster less efficient use of computing devices
[01:41:05] <c355E3B> You ever use Grammer.ly? IMO that's the space done well.
[01:41:45] <banna> I have not yet used it, no - but that is true
[01:41:51] <c355E3B> but that's a decently specific case which has had years of development and a lot of low hanging fruit
[01:42:17] <c355E3B> I feel like that for us to get there for software, its going to take a very long time and almost every big shift resets all of the work that happened
[01:46:26] <gwozniak> Personal programming assistant ideas are everywhere in older research papers

[01:59:36] <banna> would you say the difference between a bit of software acting as a 'tool' vs. 'assistant', is something that you can actually draw a line between?
[02:02:06] <banna> the abstract question trying to pry at the idea of an assistant in the first place: is it not just yet another tool, attempting to compose the usage of other tools into a useful routine that is defined by the user

[02:05:23] <banna> usually when that term is used it sucks
[02:07:03] <banna> probably annoying only due to the fact that whatever that "assistant" thing is doing is not well understood or just wrong
[02:07:36] <pe> Or it guides you too strongly.
[02:15:06] <banna> my favorite is when some UI poorly implements a in-interface tour/documentation of functions, that's just nails on chalkboard
[02:15:17] <banna> truly
[02:15:34] <banna> things like that are an all-or-nothing. same goes with whatever the hell an "assistant" might look like.

[12:18:09] <iDrougge> Mr Junior makes a toggleBonusLoading() call that toggles a bool and then hides or shows a selection of UI element. Next he makes it takes a `succeeded` argument so it no longer is a stupid toggle.
[12:19:49] <iDrougge> I ask him to break the function up into a `show` and a `hide` function. He proceeds to make an extra `toggleUI` function and a `show` function that is parametrised so that it also hides things.

[17:20:47] <edk> implementing an interface is not an exclusively dynamic type thing
[17:20:55] <riv> ok
[17:21:22] <edk> you could imagine having a boolean-ish typeclass that has instances for bool and also a bunch of containers
[17:21:30] <riv> I see what you mean
[17:21:44] <rb> right, operator bool() would be your contract there
[17:21:47] <edk> rb: yeah i know the oop do everything with objects and polymorphism meme. i think it's pretty dumb
[17:21:54] <rb> i disagree ;^)
[17:22:32] <edk> yeah but you're the sort of person who communicates exclusively in emoticons containing ^
[17:22:39] <edk> so your opinion shouldn't be taken very seriously ;^)
[17:23:15] <rb> fair enough
[17:23:31] <iDrougge> rb: Kotlin has a lot of constructs to deal with nullable references.

[17:26:29] <riv> named breaks are useful
[17:27:09] <rb> yep, and you can do that at like a block level in zig
[17:27:25] <rb> admittedly i've abused it a little bit in the past, having multilevel breaks from blocks :^)
[17:27:26] <iDrougge> rb: Yes, .let {}
[17:28:19] <rb> another thing that's super cool with zig is you can do stuff like precompute tables at compile time without having to embed obfuscated values
[17:28:29] <iDrougge> But I also found something about it lacking enough to write this. https://github.com/idrougge/KotlinGuard
[17:28:30] <rb> just embed the whole algorithm at top level and it will run at compile time

[21:57:59] <lep> well it's using public key cryptography
[21:58:07] <lep> no centralized account needed
[21:58:46] <catern> with a private key generated on each user machine?
[21:58:50] <lep> yes
[21:58:56] <catern> can I fake my stats? I guess that's not considered an issue?
[21:59:15] <lep> no, the server you play on sends the stats to xonotic server
[21:59:40] <catern> the server asks the client to sign it, then sends it to the central server?
[22:00:01] <lep> sorry, im not very certain about that part
[22:00:03] <lep> been a while :p
[22:00:09] <catern> fair enough, sounds pretty cool!
[22:00:21] <lep> also you can or have to let the xonotic main server sign you key i think
