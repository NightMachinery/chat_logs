[10:49:31] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, it's just the gura's fans.
[10:49:45] <DaPinkOne> she's a shark, and it's a play on words of "simp"
[10:50:08] <DaPinkOne> self-deprecating humor of the fan base I suppose
[10:50:57] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I have heard other fans also called shrimps.i don't watch gura
[10:50:57] <Nanobot> amigojapan: Offline, simp = someone who does things for a woman hoping to get sexual favors. Online, simp = someone who donates money to a streamer because it makes them feel like they're special to the streamer. So, people who donate to streamers started calling themselves simps as self-deprecating humor. Gura is a shark and saw someone mention "simp" in the chat, and she said, "Simp? What's that? Do you mean shrimp?" So now, her fans call themselves 
[10:50:57] <Nanobot> shrimps.
[10:51:11] <Nanobot> And then it spread to other Hololive channels
[10:51:18] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, they might've expanded it's usage. I don't keep up

[10:53:48] <DunceCotus> I don't know what a "simp" is

[10:54:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in this context, someone who donates money they superchat
[10:54:32] <DaPinkOne> DunceCotus, it means a person who donates to streamers in an effort to be noticed
[10:55:44] <DaPinkOne> there are some negative connotations. I'm not sure i've ever heard "simp" used when referring to donations to a male streamer
[10:56:14] <Nanobot> DaPinkOne: Gura's song Reflect was all about wanting to break free from her over-the-top old persona and put it behind her, along with the toxic fanbase she had.

[14:42:28] <lastonestanding> vaguely
[14:42:46] <Cryowolf> what does that entail?
[14:43:43] <lastonestanding> what I tried to say is that there are many people out there that gain money in unmoral ways, so I see no problem if one really needs it to survive
[14:44:09] <Cryowolf> So you dont know why Im asking for donations?
[14:44:23] <lastonestanding> medical reasons
[14:44:26] <lastonestanding> obviously
[14:44:28] <Cryowolf> Im just trying to understand if youre saying this with a full understanding or not
[14:44:54] <Cryowolf> so only what you deduced from today then?
[14:45:51] <lastonestanding> I know that you need extra money, because your government does not cover all costs
[14:45:55] <lastonestanding> right?
[14:46:39] <lastonestanding> you got some generous donations, and that is awesome
[14:47:17] <lastonestanding> I just was not sure from whom (cuz I remember that you did not want to ask people in this channel)
[14:47:55] <lastonestanding> and I do not know what audience you can reach other than us :)
[14:48:25] <amigojapan> Ok shibuya109 just got home
[14:48:34] <amigojapan> Hi Cryowolf 
[14:48:38] <Cryowolf> I have a very rare type of cancer called Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST), I spent 2 months in the hospital. Including before and after surgery (and hospital stays arent covered by our healthcare protection.) Then I had to go there and back many times for meetings, tests as well as chemotherapy. In the first 3 chemotherapies I had to stay in the hospital for 4 days (1 prep and 3 chemo), total of 12 days. Then the next 
[14:48:38] <Cryowolf> chemo was a trip there and back for a quick chemo visit and no hospitilisation
[14:48:56] <Cryowolf> on top of that has been bandaids and so on for wounds that were not added on prescription
[14:49:11] <Cryowolf> there has been compression socks etc that are now worn out
[14:49:24] <Cryowolf> so a lot of costs to maintain my health, including nutrition drinks
[14:49:47] <Cryowolf> I also spend a week in the infection ward, another 3 days for another infection in a ward
[14:49:49] <lastonestanding> I knew that... vaguely :)
[14:50:02] <Cryowolf> 4 ER visits (2 of which lead to infection ward)
[14:50:11] <lastonestanding> but now I see the whole story
[14:50:16] <Cryowolf> it all added up quite a bit
[14:50:20] <Cryowolf> and it's not over
[14:50:22] *** Quits: elf_fortrez (~elf_fortr@adsl-72-50-4-60.prtc.net) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[14:50:33] <Cryowolf> there are also costs I can't remember exactly but they're there
[14:51:13] <Cryowolf> and medication not entirely covered by our medical highcost protection
[14:51:48] <lastonestanding> and the pandemic adds to the complexity of the matter, or?
[14:52:03] <lastonestanding> people have to be extra careful
[14:52:29] <Cryowolf> I won't be receiving radiation therapy as there's no indication that it would be useful. I have no detectable tumors (well I didnt on the old CT+PET.) and I'm now in talks of experimental drugs/trial, that might add costs but I'm obviously not allowed to talk about it
[14:52:44] <Cryowolf> the costs will be outside of the trial though
[14:52:51] <Cryowolf> since they wont charge for the trial
[14:53:31] <Cryowolf> the pandemic might add but not that much. You have to do a covid test when you get there or if you start showing symptoms
[14:54:02] <Cryowolf> oh right I also spent 3 days in the hospital when they removed a tumor from my thymus (almost a full thymectomy)
[14:54:16] <Cryowolf> 1 day prep, 1 day recovery, 1 day rest and going home
[14:54:36] <Cryowolf> most people require 5 days of rest, but my awesomeness made it down to 1
[14:54:50] <lastonestanding> !c thymus
[14:54:51] <ImoutoBot> lastonestanding: I don't know.
[14:55:16] <lastonestanding> why don't I know what thymus is?
[14:55:36] <treeman6> anyone else a hikki like me lol
[14:55:36] <Cryowolf> cause it's not often talked about
[14:55:44] <treeman6> im just like the guys in your animes
[14:56:18] <amigojapan> shibuya109: tomako is still watching flying witch
[14:56:20] <lastonestanding> okay, I looked it up and now I recall knowing it about
[14:56:33] <Cryowolf> okay
[14:56:43] <lastonestanding> however... I did not know that it is located up there in between the lungs
[14:56:44] <Cryowolf> well I hada  tumor there, they removed it and it was benign
[14:56:52] <shibuya109> amigojapan, that will soon be over :)
[14:56:53] <Cryowolf> they used robotic assisted surgery
[14:57:05] <Cryowolf> so they made a few tiny holes on the side and went in from there
[14:57:09] <lastonestanding> now I'm scared
[14:57:20] <amigojapan> I see shibuya109

[14:57:39] <Cryowolf> yes
[14:57:46] <shibuya109> amigojapan, I mean, it does not have 100 episodes
[14:57:50] <Cryowolf> cancer can appear anywhere
[14:58:07] <lastonestanding> even in hair?
[14:58:18] <amigojapan> shibuya109: she was busy watching re zero up to yesterday
[14:58:20] <Cryowolf> not in hair, that's basically human waste product
[14:58:27] <lastonestanding> ah good
[14:58:39] <Cryowolf> it can appear in the hair gland
[14:58:43] <Cryowolf> but not in the hair itself

[17:22:48] <shibuya109> the moon is still round by the way, not split in two
[17:23:15] <amigojapan> Ok Bco1981 they are still a majority so saying "most people can tell between fantasy and reality"probably only applies to fantasy that is like art work. Not deep held beliefs, those are believed even if they are fantasy
[17:24:05] <amigojapan> shibuya109: yeah, they also believe it was put back together and they think they have seen the line on a NASA pic
[17:25:01] <shibuya109> it takes a lot of glue to do that

[17:25:20] <shibuya109> oh

[17:26:08] <shibuya109> the moon is sewn together with needle and thread

[17:26:52] <Bco1981> virtual is even better
[17:27:39] <amigojapan> shibuya109: when I was in the Japanese cult. They said the moon was made out of Ice. So I thought it was actually fake video from NASA too.i put the cult teaching over what seems real
[17:28:54] <Bco1981> amigojapan: so when the moon isn't full it is melting ?

[22:22:22] <Jigsy> Or something.
[22:22:33] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: seen it
[22:22:52] <Jigsy> I wonder if you can make wine from grape juice and yeast.
[22:23:06] <ButterNoodle> that would be hooch
[22:23:11] <emmeka> Jigsy you can, though table grape juice isn't optimized for this
[22:23:16] <omero> isnt that the whole plot point of prison school?
[22:23:24] <ButterNoodle> will still get u drunk
[22:23:29] <ButterNoodle> omero: yes... water games
[22:23:40] <ButterNoodle> whats the word for sacred water
[22:23:51] <omero> rum!
[22:23:58] <Bco1981> a coworker, in a old job, used some advanced filtering features in a firewall that suddenly blocked porn sites. So in order to test if the filter was disabled, they had to surf porn sites... at work.
[22:24:11] <emmeka> Jigsy wine grapes are really high in sugar content, but not very juicy. Table grapes are a lot juicier and crunchier with less sugar content.
[22:24:23] <Bco1981> on firewalls they used for customer internet connections
[22:24:32] <omero> Bco1981: you just described one of my old "works"
[22:24:37] <Jigsy> I still need to watch Prison School.
[22:24:44] <Jigsy> I've had it sitting on my HDD for years.

[22:24:56] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[22:25:15] <Jigsy> I should probably head to the store and buy some food.
[22:25:42] <omero> Jigsy: I only watched a few episodes... its ... not bad but not my genre
[22:26:04] <omero> the animations are surprisingly good tho

[22:26:54] <Jigsy> I'm slowly trying to work through my backlog of a quadrillion serieses.
[22:26:56] <omero> I think I never went past ep.#3
[22:27:32] <Bco1981> you never made it to the good part
[22:27:38] <omero> Im more into 'classics'

[22:29:05] <omero> right now I am trying to endure Yamato 2202
[22:29:15] <Bco1981> if you haven't made it past #6 then you haven't made it past the character introductions.
[22:29:28] <Bco1981> that goes for almost any anime
[22:30:03] <omero> if I recall correctly, prison school isnt very long... like 10-13 eps?
[22:30:09] <Bco1981> yeah
[22:30:35] <Jigsy> 12+1 OVA iirc.
[22:30:49] <Jigsy> Yeah.
[22:30:52] <Bco1981> anime with about 12 episodes, a lot of them. is still introducing new characters in #6
[22:31:00] <omero> maybe one reason I never got much far is that at the time I was recommended it by a friend... I wasnt yet used to subs

[22:31:14] <Bco1981> so... if you don't make it to #6, you haven't even started
[22:31:43] <omero> it was difficult for me... even reading english subs wasnt easy :P

[22:32:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> has always seemed a bit of a joke label to me
[22:32:25] <Jigsy> I agree.
[22:32:29] <omero> and I get "distracted" easily. 
[22:32:30] <Jigsy> It should be NSFHR.
[22:32:35] <Jigsy> "Not Safe for Human Resources."
[22:32:43] <Bco1981> not safe for boss
[22:32:45] <omero> good one, Jigsy 
[22:33:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The vernacular meaning is fairly clear, but the strict reading is amusing.

[22:33:48] <Jigsy> Or sheeple, really.
[22:33:55] <omero> I personally have an aversion for acronyms
[22:34:10] <Jigsy> AAS, eh?
[22:34:24] <omero> because my mind always finds twisted meanings...
[22:34:51] <Bco1981> omero: because the real meanings are boring
[22:35:00] * omero nods
[22:35:17] <Jigsy> Okay, store. Need to buy dinner.
