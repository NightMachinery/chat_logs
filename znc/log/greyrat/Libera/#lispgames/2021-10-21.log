[03:30:34] <verma> hello friends, I am very new to common lisp and am trying to make a game for the lisp game jam, I have previous lisp wrangling experience with lisp through clojure. I was wondering what's a good way to reload all resourses for a defapp .. so that I could re-initialize my array buffers and see what they look like.
[03:31:33] <verma> sorry this is in context of cl-bodge
[03:32:00] <verma> When I try to stop my game I get a slot-unbound on cl-bodge.host::destroy-continuation :/
[03:32:43] <verma> I think I am looking for a tighter feedback loop for modifying my array buffers
[03:34:18] <verma> perhaps sweeping-flow followed by configuration-flow, someway to trigger that may be. I've tried to add in hooks to modify slots for the app instance, but since the render loop is continously running, I get a GL bad bind error when I try to modify the array buffer.
[04:23:29] <verma> for now I added a `dispose-and-reinit` function to the draw defmethod, it just deletes the array buffer and recreates it.

[16:40:16] <dthompson> is that a question to me or to everyone? I just don't have time to organize a stream
[17:05:56] <dthompson> would anyone care to test out a pre-release linux build? the game is obviously very incomplete but I'm curious if my bundle works on at least *some* linux machines.
[17:06:11] <shoshin> i could give it a try
[17:06:13] <dthompson> https://files.dthompson.us/bonnie-bee-0.1.tar.gz
[17:08:35] <shoshin> lol omg i was not expecting bullet hell
[17:08:39] <shoshin> i love it
[17:08:43] <dthompson> oh yay it works!!
[17:08:49] <shoshin> gave me some good laughs
[17:08:49] <dthompson> thank you for trying shoshin!
[17:09:01] <shoshin> i couldn't figure out how to quit, thats the only thing
[17:09:15] <dthompson> does clicking the X on the window work?
[17:09:18] <shoshin> it did not
[17:09:22] <dthompson> weird!
[17:09:23] <dthompson> okay
[17:09:32] <dthompson> I will work on that
[17:09:32] <shoshin> maybe just me ? idk
[17:09:39] <dthompson> nah I think it will be for everyone
[17:09:44] <dthompson> the Q key should work, though
[17:09:52] <shoshin> ok, i didn't try that 
[17:10:03] <dthompson> I'll make sure that ESC and the X button on the window both work
[17:10:04] <shoshin> good music too 
[17:10:22] <dthompson> oh thanks they are my first attempt at making game music with milkytracker
[17:10:37] <shoshin> the contrast between the intro and the in-game is quite effective
[17:11:39] <shoshin> Q does work ;)
[17:11:43] <dthompson> that's good
[17:11:59] <dthompson> I think I just didn't implement the event handler for the x button on the window
[17:12:29] <shoshin> cool to see chickadee in action! i've seen you posting about it on the fedi
[17:12:45] <dthompson> yeah it's finally starting to become something that is decently usable
[17:13:01] <dthompson> this jam has gone sooooo smoothly compared to past ones
[17:13:11] <dthompson> I threw this thing together pretty quickly

[17:35:54] <dthompson> yeah that game was something that would only run on my computer basically
[17:35:58] <dthompson> didn't have pre-built binaries
[17:36:06] <dthompson> so of course no one played it
[17:36:20] <dthompson> but hey, it was a stepping stone to now.
[17:36:59] <dthompson> love these game jams as a binannual test of my stack
[17:39:52] <makomo> dthompson: i tried it out as well just because. works on my end too :D
[17:40:05] <makomo> but so far nothing's scrolling or moving forward, right? all i can do is shoot these couple of flowers and that's it
[17:43:58] <dthompson> makomo: there's some difficult to read text that should appear telling you the controls
[17:44:08] <dthompson> if you follow those prompts the game will start for real
[17:44:20] <dthompson> haven't gotten around to making the text better yet
[17:44:24] <makomo> dthompson: hmm, i did see the text telling me to move with the arrow keys and shoot with z
[17:44:41] <makomo> but it just stays on "shoot with z" and that's it. i can shoot just fine, but the text doesn't go away
[17:44:51] <dthompson> uh oh. sounds like a bug.
[17:46:47] <dthompson> I wonder if it would happen again if you restarted the game.
[17:47:12] <shoshin> it worked for me, it took a sec to realize i needed to do the "press X" part to progress
[17:47:36] <dthompson> I will make the text readable before the jam is over. been putting that off.
[17:47:43] <makomo> dthompson: hmm, it looks like if i press my Y key then it works :'D
[17:47:52] <makomo> i have a qwertz layout
[17:48:03] <makomo> if i press my Z, that does shoot, but i have to press my Y to actually go past the prompt
[17:48:23] <dthompson> makomo: ah I was just about to ask about keyboard layout!
[17:48:35] <makomo> does the 1st boss ever die ;_;
[17:48:36] <dthompson> that is interesting. I must be doing something wrong with sdl, then.
[17:48:47] <dthompson> makomo: yes, after awhile. goes through 3 phases.
[17:49:05] <makomo> i got to the 3rd and then died after a little bit :'D
[17:49:08] <dthompson> if the boss changes phase, then you know you've taken off 1/3rd of its health
[17:49:20] <makomo> oic
[17:49:32] <dthompson> (game designer's secret) ;)
[17:49:36] <makomo> ;D
[17:50:38] <dthompson> I just scripted the boss this morning. I was able to consistently beat it so I called it good. I have a bunch of the middle section to script, then maybe I'll revisit if there's time.
[17:50:57] <dthompson> there are two more types of enemy that will appear.

[18:51:21] <dthompson> I second that ^
[18:52:01] <dthompson> I've been participating in these jams for like 5 years and I've only submitted something twice.
[18:52:06] * thrig cues some Rocky III re-runs
[18:52:19] <dthompson> but each time I've learned new things for the nex ttime
[18:53:12] <dthompson> found bugs in the stack, built new functions that I will reuse for the next jam, etc.
[18:57:46] <technomancy> it's like the rhythm of breathing
[18:58:11] <technomancy> hack on the compiler and tools a bunch, then use them in the "real world" to see how they feel, then go back to hacking, then using
[19:08:48] <thrig> ... read the compiler source code, wonder why crazy sysv hacks require 200 lines of error checking on something you only use on BSD ...
[19:18:04] <dthompson> in addition to my general purpose game library, I've also been slowly building what you might call an "engine". unreleased but I've been using and improving upon it for several jams now.
[19:18:24] <thrig> quicker than waiting for godot
[19:18:25] <dthompson> the jams have served as very critical "road tests"
[19:18:55] <dthompson> I think Godot is cool. just not for me.
[19:19:13] <dthompson> I'd rather toil in obscurity :)
[19:19:39] <thrig> I use vwait godot in all my TCL scripts (that need that)
[19:19:53] <verma> I did learn quite a bit really and I am very happy about that, like 4-5 days ago I couldn't make head or tail out of sbcl or quicklisp or quickload or asdf .. but I've come to admire those tools now
[19:20:13] <dthompson> that's a successful jam then!
[19:21:01] <verma> really the biggest thing I cannot figure out is how to recover my game loop in cl-bodge when something goes wrong .. like I have to quit by sly session and start again :'(
[19:21:13] <verma> s/by/my
[19:21:41] <dthompson> I'm also having problems with dev tools this time around and don't have as good of a workflow as usual
[19:21:50] <dthompson> lots of game restarts that I wouldn't normally have to do
[19:23:07] <verma> yeah :( .. I think I can deal with with a non-game type of program with common lisp now, but game dev with live reload is kind of the deep end of the pool.
[19:23:51] <verma> but thanks for encouragement everyone, perhaps I should push till the last day.
[19:26:17] <dthompson> :)
[19:26:19] <borodust> verma: rerun flow block
[19:27:53] <verma> thanks borodust, I am just brining up the dev env and will try, while you're here, is there a good way to get rid of the "only one instance of app game kit can be active" at a time?
[19:28:40] <borodust> sometimes skip works, but rarely
[19:28:54] <verma> I see, I will try it
[19:29:17] <verma> also are flows something of a common lisp concept or is it something of a cl-bodge concept?
[19:29:46] <borodust> but you made really dangerous choice with cl bodge for ham :D
[19:29:51] <borodust> err, jam
[19:29:57] <verma> lol :D
[19:30:11] <borodust> verma: no, flows is a cl-bodge thing
[19:30:22] <borodust> one of the experimental tech un there
[19:30:25] <borodust> *in
[19:30:35] <verma> I started with cl-sdl2 but I really did want shaders and it felt like cl-bodge was doing a lot of heavy lifting for me :)
[19:30:46] <thrig> the bacon and jam hasn't got much spam in it
[19:30:47] <borodust> trivial-gamekit us much simpler
[19:30:58] <borodust> and more conventional
[19:31:37] <borodust> gamekit alsi support shaders through postprocessing plugin
[19:31:56] <borodust> damn, typing from phone sucks as always)
[19:32:22] <borodust> anyway, its too late to switch probably
[19:32:36] <verma> hmm yeah, I am not sure why I didn't go for that, it was pretty early in my common lisp journey so wasn't sure what I was doing
[19:32:57] <verma> well, I barely have anything running at this point, so should be able to switch, I will give it a shot!
[19:33:32] <borodust> just link me a repo and ill see what i can help you with
[19:33:52] <verma> I don't have it sitting anywhere yet, but I will get it up somewhere today and share it here
[19:33:54] <borodust> maybe ill be able to help with migration
[19:34:11] <borodust> gamekit is simple but no 3d
[19:34:24] <borodust> so if that was your goal then it wont help
[19:34:30] <verma> ah, I do need 3D
[19:34:53] <verma> although its a platformer but I wanted one 3D perspective to impress my son :P
[19:37:22] <borodust> well
[19:38:35] <technomancy> how old is your son? =)
[19:42:28] <dthompson> 38
[19:43:25] <technomancy> I'll be honest, I kinda want to embed a lisp into gzdoom and make a chex quest game to play with my kids.
[19:44:20] <borodust> verma: shipping 3d with lisp is gonna be slightly painful
[19:44:23] <borodust> sadly
[19:45:26] <borodust> ill help however i can, but depending on whats gonna be in graphics part might not squeeze into jam timeframe
[19:46:06] <dthompson> I recommend sticking to 2d for a first game! saves a lot of headache

[20:18:49] <Icefoz> Hmmm, is there a good way to do live reload with Fennel and Love2D?  I'm used to Rust so I've been just doing quit and restart every time something changes, but if I'm gonna use a dynamic language I might as well take advantage of it.
[20:19:18] <Icefoz> And yeah 3D is like an order of magnitude more difficult than 2D.
[20:19:33] <technomancy> Icefoz: are you using the min-love2d-fennel skeleton? it has a repl with reloading built-in.
[20:19:44] <thrig> (not sure why we call x+y+time 2D...)
[20:20:27] <technomancy> Icefoz: ,reload module-name should do the trick
[20:20:36] <technomancy> (doesn't really have anything to do with the type system)
[20:20:38] <Icefoz> I am using it, I like the repl but didn't see that it could reload stuff.  I'll take another look.
[20:21:24] <technomancy> I guess it should be made clearer. it supports all the same commands as the normal; try ,help
[20:21:26] <Icefoz> No, it has to do with the compilation/runtime model.  Rust very much encourages as little dynamic behavior as possible at runtime.  :)
[20:21:35] <Icefoz> I will play with it then.  Thanks!

[23:00:58] <dthompson> if that's what you're worried about.
[23:01:09] <dto> mainly. there' wouldn't be any proprietary code.
[23:01:30] <dthompson> assuming the GPL was being used, that covers the software only.
[23:01:35] <dto> yep.
[23:01:41] <dto> someone wants to remix the game itself, make it their own, etc

[23:02:53] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[23:03:03] <dthompson> want to try an early build? a lot missing but I'm trying to maybe catch any issues with the build before the jam is over.

[23:03:06] <dto> i might not finish anything for this jam, i'm kind of distracted by the shift to a rhythm game. but if i complete anythhing this week , such as a very basic random arrows kicking to a bea,t i'll be sure to share the prototype :)
[23:03:07] <dto> sure
[23:03:41] <dthompson> the text isn't very readable currently. haven't picked out the font I really want to use, so pardon that as well.
[23:03:57] <dthompson> if the game boots then the test is a success. :)
[23:05:34] <dto> works great! i got to the red boss but couldn't defeat him!
[23:05:40] <dto> 60fps
[23:06:29] <dthompson> dto: awesome. did you see an fps counter displayed or are you using some software?
[23:06:57] <dto> i didn't see any counter but it looked very smooth
[23:07:01] <dthompson> I have an fps counter but it's supposed to only show up in dev mode, which this build shouldn't be in. so that's a bug.
[23:07:02] <dthompson> oh cool
[23:07:05] <dthompson> just making sure
[23:07:07] <dto> yep!
[23:07:18] *** Quits: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse) (Client Quit)
[23:07:23] <dthompson> thank you for testing
[23:07:41] <dto> welcomed!
[23:07:43] <dto> :)
[23:07:49] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[23:07:58] <dthompson> I have the beginning and end playable. it's the middle chunk that I need to fill in before the jam ends.
[23:08:14] <dthompson> I have two more types of enemy to incorporate and extend the total play time a few minutes.
[23:08:45] <dto> awesome. keep me informed!
[23:08:51] <dto> how many peeps are participating? 
[23:09:16] <dthompson> the jam page says 69 currently.
[23:09:18] <dthompson> (nice)
[23:10:16] <dthompson> so hopefully we get a good amount of submissions!
[23:10:30] <mfiano> 3 submissions so far
[23:10:40] <mfiano> (secret maintainer info)
[23:10:45] <dthompson> I don't know if I'll post any more preview builds before the jam is over now that I know a bunch of people can play it.
[23:12:33] <dto> cool mfiano hi!
[23:13:32] <mfiano> Average number of submissions over 10 jams is 13
[23:13:49] <mfiano> min=1, max=27
[23:14:53] <borodust> my estimation is like number of submissions divided by 6-8
[23:15:28] <borodust> so 8-12 submissions
[23:16:04] <mfiano> the one with 1 submissions was borodust's ball-z in the first jam i hosted 10 jams ago
[23:16:13] <borodust> ;p
[23:16:14] <mfiano> it was a flop :)
[23:16:20] <mfiano> not the game, the jam
[23:16:30] <borodust> game too
[23:16:31] <mfiano> only 7 joined
[23:16:51] <borodust> almost no one could run it
[23:17:06] <mfiano> i attribute that to late notice/lack of advertising iirc
[23:17:06] <borodust> it's that time i figured out i need to setup delivery process first
[23:17:54] <mfiano> stats for who cares https://i.lisp.cl/99IcTk.png
[23:18:45] <borodust> jeez times fly
[23:19:31] <mfiano> half of the jams had joins end with a '7' :)
[23:22:39] <mfiano> please let me know if you see any games that aren't lisp when the voting process begins
[23:23:12] <mfiano> there's always at least 1 or 2...seems to be better after i added the 'are you sure you followed the rules"' question when submitting :)
[23:23:22] <mfiano> was a lot before :/
[23:24:31] <mfiano> also voting process is open to anyone this time. i discovered a human error in the last jam we had where voting was only for submitters only
[23:24:58] <mfiano> i wish someone let me know last spring :(
