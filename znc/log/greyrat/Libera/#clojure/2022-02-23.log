[01:18:27] <TimMc> Para: They should add more channels. ðŸ˜ˆ
[01:18:36] <technomancy> TimMc: and more threads; that will help
[01:18:43] <TimMc> I <3 threads
[01:18:45] <ridcully_> or add "communications" like gitter
[01:18:46] <Para> TimMc: Both large corporate Slacks I've been within the past year had more channels than people :D
[01:18:54] <TimMc> :party_parrot:
[01:18:54] <ridcully_> clearly nesting helps
[01:19:00] <Para> Also oh man, majority of people Just.Not.Getting.Threads!
[01:19:01] <technomancy> slack is just like sheets; the higher the thread count the better you can fall asleep
[01:19:16] <TimMc> My favorite chat interface actually has unlimited thread nesting. It's fantastic.
[01:19:26] <sobel> i'm slowly pressing a related case on the vert.x discord. the #general is 90% new user entry messages + bot welcomes. everything else is so stovepiped there's not a venue for real knowledge transfer
[01:19:35] <technomancy> ridcully_: I've never used gitter; is it bad? it seemed to have a "well, at least it's not slack/discord" vibe
[01:19:45] <Para> I still want to try mattermost somewhere.
[01:20:03] <Para> Maybe I should come up with a tech startup scam I mean business idea and get government funding.
[01:20:12] <Para> Really I'd just hire a few dozen people to chat with me on mattermost.
[01:20:13] <ridcully_> technomancy: "well, at least it can be searched from public services" is what you are looking for
[01:21:10] <Para> Oh what, hadn't checked for a while - Mattermost now has an agile swimlane board and...built-in CI? Whaaat :)
[01:21:16] <technomancy> anyway having written my own personal IRC server implementation I must say it's a great experience and I recommend it for everyone.
[01:21:28] <technomancy> I managed to bring a few people over from work when slack was down this morning
[01:21:41] <ridcully_> mattermost totally fails on make me aware shits going on... but maybe this is a good thing.  it's the one i least took offence (mattermost that is)
[01:23:37] <TimMc> Discord's thread are a really interesting approach. I hated it at first but now I get it.
[01:24:17] <ridcully_> walled off garden... or whatever.  or has that changed?
[01:24:38] <technomancy> TimMc: "I get it" doesn't really imply not hating it
[01:24:58] <TimMc> hah
[01:25:19] <Para> Well, as long as it's not email.
[01:25:24] <TimMc> It's not what I would prefer, but it works really well for some use-cases.
[01:25:37] <ridcully_> i think that infinite nesting one mentioned was email
[01:26:14] <TimMc> Slack's threads work well for brief, lightweight interactions; Discord's are better for heavyweight, more involved convos.
[01:27:18] <TimMc> This, though... this has fully nested threading and it's great: https://euphoria.io/room/xkcd/
[01:28:08] <TimMc> The UI isn't fully finished and probably never will be, though, because it's the product of a failed chat startup. It's just kept on life-support now.

[01:33:56] <TimMc> (Also, as configured by default, no accounts are required. Like IRC.)
[01:34:19] <Para> reminds me of a person on some other tech channel from years back, he was generally a known nuisance; one of those people who have the skill to write a lot of code, but not enough vision to understand that using already made things is a thing for a reason.
[01:34:57] <Para> For example he'd reimplement first angular the way he understood it as his own library and when react entered the scene, would adapt his own to work like that as well.
[01:35:41] <Para> Somehow he ran a successful business on the side, although he only barely made a living :) Anyhoo, one day he decided to create a web irc proxy for his customers and promoted it en masse.
[01:36:11] <Para> Too bad the web irc proxy brought all the people to this one channel I already mentioned with random generated names so it looked like some kind of flood attack to which ops reacted as ones would :D
[01:36:27] <Para> It was a fun afternoon to follow from the sidelines.
[01:36:36] <sobel> freenode level foresight
[01:36:56] <Para> The way his business worked was that this chat service was advertised as primary support channel or some crap like that so obviously with bannings his customers would start complaining etc.
[01:37:17] <TimMc> amazing

[18:47:24] <Para> Alright this is very interesting, it seems my source file isn't flushed properly so it's missing a parts from the end.
[18:49:00] <Para> Well, caused probably by accidental evaluation so whatever. Still, it's curious it corrupted the actual zip even.
[18:57:27] <sobel> that's well more legit than a service i download from, which lets its handler that sends the zipfile fall through to the menu page

[19:33:46] <Para> Okay, I suspect I caused this myself by piling IO turtles. So this plugin I've now almost completed should have a feature which writes a file. I'm alredy using an automatic middleware registration feature of Leiningen which the documentation pleas one not to use, the EDN output example from Clojure Cookbook recommend temporary binding of *out*, Cursive does its magic on top of everything and I'm
[19:33:47] <Para> building versions in terminal... I suspect there's just too many rebindings and someone somewhere just gives up and the magic smoke is released :)
