[00:35:01] <acdw> oh shit yeah that one
[00:35:02] <acdw> damn

[00:36:03] <bpalmer> if the map you're talking about is the major mode's map, you can usually use local-set-key , which saves you from having to look up the map name.
[00:36:30] *** Quits: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[00:36:55] <bpalmer> but for more complicated modes with associated minor modes (and org certainly has its complications), a more precise define-key is useful.
[00:37:02] <dale> Huh, I just noticed that, while lsp-mode nicely highlights all occurrences of the symbol at point, if you scroll down e.g. with mouse to reveal more occurrences, those additional occurrences are not highlighted.
[00:37:13] <razzy> acdw: thx
[00:37:28] <dale> So I'm guessing it just updates when you move point, and only considers lines visible in the current window.  Maybe just as part of normal font-lock, not sure.

[00:41:23] <razzy> hmm, does not work
[00:42:05] <razzy> what is "Key sequence C - i starts with non-prefix key C "
[00:43:27] <bpalmer> razzy: do you want to affect control and i pressed together?
[00:43:49] <bpalmer> razzy: the sequence C - i    is pressing capital C and letting go, then pressing - and letting go, then pressing i and letting go
[00:44:01] <bpalmer> whereas C-i   is control and i together
[00:45:25] <bpalmer> emacs is confused, because C (just the letter C, probably gotten by hitting shift and c together) is a prefix key if it's bound to a keymap, because then the - would be looked up in the keymap; that - would be bound to a keymap, in which the letter i would be looked up to find a command.
[00:45:53] <bpalmer> but in most keymaps, C (the key you get from shift and c) is just bound to insert a C.
[00:46:41] <bpalmer> If you're unsure how to write a keybinding, use C-h k and then press the key. The way it's written in the top left is something you can just copy into a kbd form.
[00:47:01] <bpalmer> e.g., (kbd "C-i") , (kbd "TAB") , (kbd "C-d")

[06:55:28] <alphapapa[m]> I think the problem is that you don't understand what kinds of values org-element returns from parsing a buffer.  The data structure is not exactly intuitive.
[06:55:31] <bpalmer> Assuming that org-element-map with a parse tree and 'paragraph is only supposed to call the callback function with paragraphs.

You just have to read the backtrace carefully, step through the code carefully, find the mistaken assumptions, and fix the code.
[06:57:52] <bpalmer> you could try doing (when (not (stringp (car org-element-contents paragraph))) (insert (format "Received %S" paragraph)))  to see what's going on.

[08:12:27] <aspic> no, and no, sadly.  I'm playing around with widgets (forms as seen in `customize') and the behaviour is hokey.
[08:12:58] <tali713> aspic: oh, keymaps can also be attached as a text property
[08:13:44] <alphapapa[m]> ah, widgets.  Yeah, not the easiest library to understand IME, but it can do some cool things.  Anyway, "C-h k SOME-KEY" should tell you what keymap a key was looked up in
[08:13:51] <tali713> I'm not certain, but I think that's the highest priority keymap.  (I'd have to read a lot of source to be certain)
[08:14:23] <alphapapa[m]> Yes, overlays and text properties can override keymaps
[08:15:12] <alphapapa[m]> aspic: BTW, you may find the library ewoc.el interesting.  I'm using it in Ement.el, and it works very nicely.
[08:15:14] <tali713> which I'm pretty sure how buttons, links and widgets are constructed in emacs.
[08:15:14] <aspic> tali713: better - although `describe-text-properties' gives me the actual /contents/ of the keymap rather than the name.
[08:15:48] <aspic> alphapapa[m]: will look into ewoc.el, thanks.
[08:15:58] <alphapapa[m]> aspic: AFAIK that's how keymaps in properties/overlays work.  Please see the Elisp manual, it describes how all that really works.
[08:16:02] <tali713> aspic: yeah, that's because it's probably a reference to the keymap, not the name of the keymap.  for that you'd probably need to read source.
[08:16:24] <aspic> alphapapa[m]: you are not wrong in widgets having a steep learning curve!
[08:16:35] <tali713> it might not even have a name, that's not required.
[08:16:38] <alphapapa[m]> aspic: I still don't understand what widget-convert does
[08:17:06] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: if a keymap text property is a symbol, it's treated as a function name, see the Elisp manual.  Unintuitive but that's how it works
[08:17:50] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: that actually isn't that unintuitive to me, keymaps aren't generally referred to by name.
[08:18:15] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: Aren't they?  e.g. use-local-map
[08:18:34] <aspic> tali713: either/or it's an excellent start to work out my oddity.  (C-e "should" go to the end of the text entered in an 'editable-field.  It certainly does in `customize'.  In my version, it goes to the end of the field.  Not the end of the world, but annoying all the same.)
[08:19:05] <alphapapa[m]> aspic: widget.el has its own section in the Elisp manual too
[08:19:36] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: at that level, yes, they are named, but then when you do key-lookup it's a tree of unnamed keymaps.  (at least last I checked)
[08:20:04] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: Probably so, but that seems like an internal implementation detail, right?
[08:20:09] <aspic> alphapapa[m]: read it enough to know I need to program in it first, before I re-read (and understand) the documentation :-)

[08:20:38] <alphapapa[m]> aspic: haha, yeah... good luck with that... maybe you can help me figure some things out after you've done that :)
[08:21:03] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: yeah, exactly, but is paralel to the assignment of a keymap to a text property, you assign the value referred to by the name to the keymap of the text, where it is then referred to directly.
[08:21:05] <aspic> OK, I think I have enough material to consider before having anything useful to add back into the mix.  thanks all.
[08:21:11] <alphapapa[m]> aspic: I want to make a new widget based on the expandable customization widgets... seems like it ought to be trivial, but so far it hasn't been
[08:21:27] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: so why not duplex using a literal symbol as a function, that's what I'd do.
[08:21:51] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: I would expect that setting the keymap text property to a symbol would use the value of that symbol as the keymap
[08:22:31] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: so you could e.g. change it later and then backwards effect the keymap?
[08:22:51] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: Yeah, otherwise I have to modify the text property all over the buffer to effect changes
[08:24:00] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: fair enough.

[13:57:55] <edgarvincent[m]> I'd like to have a command which lists all "org" files in `org-directory` recursively and allow me to use completion in order to select a candidate and visit it. I used to use `ivy-read` for that but now use Vertico/Consult, and I'm not sure how to do it. I tried `read-file-name` but I can't get it to show all files recursively (in a "flat" way).

[20:46:47] <dale> Normally I just react to suggestions of an Elisp LSP server with blank stares, but now that I think about it, if you want to integrate into all the LSP fancy stuff like completion or whatever, maybe there's a case for it, if only so that you don't have to rewrite all that stuff yourself.
[20:47:18] <technomancy> oh yeah I don't say that to dissuade anyone
[20:47:24] <dale> Could probably be a fake server that just implements the important bits of the API.  Might be embarrassing if you have to introduce JSON as an intermediary transport to your fake LSP server.
[20:47:32] <dale> Fake as in not an actual separate process.
[20:47:35] <_dave> dumb question: if i can defun in a defun, would that be better off as a macro or are macros mainly for being able to change the symbols (eg. function name)?

[20:51:23] <cvandusen> I thought that's what dabbrevs were for. 
[20:51:56] <technomancy> edgar-rft: most of LSP is predicated on the idea that macros don't exist TBH
[20:52:32] <dale> Can someone give an example of how macros are fundamentally at odds with LSP?
[20:52:43] <bpalmer> _dave: macros are most useful for the ability to alter normal evaluation rules.
[20:53:01] <technomancy> dale: more like macros being fundamentally at odds with static analysis. you have to macro-expand in order to identify what is really happening.
[20:53:09] <bpalmer> _dave: however, nested defuns in elisp bear some consideration: unlike scheme's define, a defun is always global.
[20:53:23] <technomancy> any analysis which refuses to run any code is too cowardly to be used in a lisp
[20:53:44] <bpalmer> _dave: to make local functions, you'd use something like flet or cl-letf, labels or cl-labels, letf

[20:54:33] <_dave> edgar-rft: I've seen that with cl-loop and it still throws me for a, heh, loop.
[20:54:40] <bpalmer> _dave: to make it very cleare: (defun foo (a) (defun add (x y) (+ x y))  (add a a))   <-- you have now defined two global functions, foo, and add
[20:54:57] <technomancy> it's like "we're language agnostic. works with every language. by the way the only languages which exist are algol-derivatives."
[20:55:00] <dale> technomancy: I'm thinking, in the case of something like Elisp, couldn't the LSP server just do something like what the Elisp byte compiler does to expand macros and such?
[20:55:05] <_dave> it's a global i'm trying to define as a part of eieio voodoo.
[20:55:33] <bpalmer> if you're just trying to dynamically compute the name, you can look at just fsetting a symbol's function slot directly.
[20:55:57] <_dave> oh right forgot that symbols have slots.
[20:55:59] <edgar-rft> _dave: but would the LSP server be able to identify (infix 1 + 2 + 3) as valid Lisp syntax?
[20:56:05] <bpalmer> (fset (intern (format "add-%s" unique-name)) (lambda () (+ x y)))
[20:56:10] <dale> edgar-rft: (That was probably for me)
[20:56:22] <technomancy> dale: yeah I mean to have a useful LSP server you basically have to subvert the LSP paradigm. which you should do. it's just the opposite of what LSP wants you to do.

[22:38:31] <acdw> the function i'm trying to use puts info in the modeline, it just takes too long to compute for big files

[22:45:26] <aniketgm> why would you want to have word count in Org files. Those grow like crazy, over time. Forget word count, I saw in some blogs where people mention they have like 100k lines 
[22:46:43] <aniketgm> well, I would say that's too much, unless it's managed properly.

[22:51:57] <rdbeni0> which defun i need to use to do something like that: 1) select region in emacs 2) send that data into STDIN in normal CLI script (let's say - sed or awk) 3) read STDOUT from that script 4) replace selected region in emacs with STDOUT from that particular CLI command

[23:09:59] <johnjay> the subtleties of the emacs interpret mystify me. i think the recursive clause in cl--do-subst is simply there as an extra optimzation
[23:10:23] <johnjay> specifically this line: (if (and (eq a (car cl-tree)) (eq d (cdr cl-tree)))

[23:12:22] <johnjay> that's usually why you have such superfluous checks
