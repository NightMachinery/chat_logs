[22:08:53] <yeik-the-spik[m]> The let is 20 lines long, I call different functions in different tests in a couple spots. I thought about putting that into a function.

[22:31:28] <joaquin> ok, this is yeik, trying new stuffs. that is the code I've got working. Hopefully it is not a pain to access anymore
[22:31:40] <joaquin> First things first. How bad is having a function like that? Do I really need a macro here,
[22:31:42] <joaquin> or should I be happy that I don't?Y
[22:31:50] <joaquin> My first attempt at turning that into a macro would be to just get rid of the _eval_ and turn the
[22:31:52] <joaquin> function into a macro. That would however not work, since the _and_ clause that I pass is  quoted.
[22:32:11] <joaquin> If it gets unquoted, I get an error, because _func-results_ is not defined anywere. 
[22:32:26] <joaquin> That kinda baffles me, since I understood that the main difference between _defmacro_ and _defn_ is that
[22:32:28] <joaquin> _defmacro_ does not evaluate the parameters passed. 
[22:32:42] <joaquin> Then I've tried to pass the _and_ clause quoted. Then the macro does not work, since the clause remains quoted and it's just returned.
[22:32:53] <joaquin> I have tried to do some double unquoting, but I get some sort of unbouded unquote error. Which, again, it baffles me to some level, since the code is quoted.
[22:33:19] <joaquin> And I guess I have to leave now, since someone has set fire to the building or something
