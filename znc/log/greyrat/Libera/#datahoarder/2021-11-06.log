[01:58:56] <w1kl4s> rmmh it's complicated with ceph
[01:59:10] <w1kl4s> but zfs has as sequential scrub as it gets
[01:59:17] <rmmh> ...no it doesn't
[01:59:51] <w1kl4s> > A scrub is split into two parts: metadata scanning and block scrubbing. The metadata scanning sorts blocks into large sequential ranges which can then be read much more efficiently from disk when issuing the scrub I/O.

[02:00:01] <rmmh> hm maybe I'm missing that
[02:00:23] <w1kl4s> it was added in 0.7 something i think? or maybe 0.8 whatever
[02:00:38] <w1kl4s> if you're running old zfs from like ubuntu 18 it might not have it
[02:00:43] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_ø<​ q​uack!
[02:01:00] <w1kl4s> ,bang
[02:01:01] <unfinity> w1kl4s you shot a duck in 17.379 seconds! You have killed 1 duck in #datahoarder.
[02:01:19] <w1kl4s> anywho Ceph is way more complicated than that because it's object storage, not block storage
[02:01:26] <rmmh> 0.8.3
[02:01:38] <rmmh> typically file storage is more complex than object storage
[02:01:41] <w1kl4s> if you are mad at performance during scrubs 
[02:01:48] <w1kl4s> then trust me ceph is not for you
[02:02:13] <rmmh> S3's new log-structured backend looks good
[02:03:54] <w1kl4s> sequential scrub is from 0.8
[02:04:04] <w1kl4s> so yeah, it doesn't get better than that
[02:04:13] <rmmh> unfortunate
[02:04:20] <DataHoarder> you can configure intervals, pauses and schedules on ceph rmmh 
[02:04:25] <DataHoarder> for scrubbing
[02:04:51] <rmmh> I'll probably just do an 8x16TB RAID-Z2 instead, idk
[02:05:00] <DataHoarder> just fix your stuff w1kl4s, but yeah defalts are quite extreme for scrubbing
[02:05:08] <DataHoarder> TL;DR if it fits on a host, don't do ceph
[02:05:10] <w1kl4s> if you are looking at single node then ceph is wrong anyway
[02:05:22] <w1kl4s> it's 3 hosts minimum
[02:05:26] <DataHoarder> if it fits on many hosts, don't do ceph, unless ceph makes too much sense for you
[02:05:36] <rmmh> I was looking at this https://creativemisconfiguration.wordpress.com/2020/05/10/three-node-ceph-cluster/
[02:05:37] <DataHoarder> 1 min, 3 recommended w1kl4s :)
[02:05:53] <w1kl4s> rmmh ceph at home is last resort
[02:05:59] <DataHoarder> :(
[02:06:05] <w1kl4s> you don't want to use it if you don't have to
[02:06:07] <rmmh> asking a bunch of data hoarders for reasonable recs, lol
[02:06:23] <rmmh> right now my setup is uh, kind of Special
[02:06:30] <DataHoarder> hey I am the og ceph shill from where w1kl4s comes from :P
[02:06:36] <w1kl4s> ^
[02:07:08] <DataHoarder> if you don't want flexibility don't use ceph
[02:07:19] <w1kl4s> s/want/absolutely need/
[02:07:32] <DataHoarder> but if you want that, be ready to read so much documentation, and mailing lists 
[02:07:40] <DataHoarder> it expects you live fulltime on ceph
[02:07:47] <DataHoarder> oh right
[02:07:54] <DataHoarder> I made Ceph docs .epub :)
[02:07:58] <rmmh> I have a 4x12TB RAID-Z1 on a USB-3 4-disk docking station on top of my tower https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H11KXCL
[02:08:34] <DataHoarder> https://github.com/WeebDataHoarder/ceph-epub
[02:08:41] <DataHoarder> should run this again for latest
[02:08:46] <DataHoarder> goes well on a Kindle :)
[02:09:02] <w1kl4s> ceph should be last resort option when you already have 3 proper servers with backplanes and all that, 10g networking, good chunk of free cpu time, and way too much free time on your hands
[02:09:19] <w1kl4s> don't do it unless you're bloody sure you want to
[02:09:24] <DataHoarder> ^ switched to ceph cause I was tired of handling different nodes and merging fs 
[02:09:31] <DataHoarder> and wanting to use resources across
[02:09:43] <DataHoarder> plus major flexibility
[02:09:57] <rmmh> And a 4x10TB MD-RAID5 lvm crypted XFS setup on a similar external USB setup
[02:10:16] <rmmh> the XFS array is *much* faster than the zfs one
[02:10:32] <DataHoarder> ZFS gives you a protected utility knife
[02:10:56] <DataHoarder> ceph gives you a factory of sharp blades, you tell it how long, how sharp, and how to fill your mattress with them
[02:10:59] <rmmh> and an internal 4x4TB RAID5 ext4
[02:11:14] <rmmh> so clearly I should try something dumber
[02:11:29] <DataHoarder> try btrfs on LVM on mdadm raid6
[02:11:35] <DataHoarder> fuckin Synology
[02:11:36] <rmmh> god I had btrfs for a while
[02:11:39] <rmmh> it was a complete piece of shit
[02:11:42] <DataHoarder> that thing took ages to migrate
[02:11:43] <rmmh> slowest filesystem I've ever used
[02:11:56] <DataHoarder> as I was doing in-place shrinking each step of the way
[02:12:05] <DataHoarder> of btrfs + defrag
[02:12:06] <DataHoarder> lvm
[02:12:09] <rmmh> including ZFS without SSD L2ARC for metadata on 5400RPM usb drives
[02:12:09] <DataHoarder> then mdadm
[02:12:17] <rmmh> I think I did the same migration
[02:12:48] <DataHoarder> half of it was SMR :')
[02:13:05] <rmmh> I have an external 12TB SMR drive with nilfs2
[02:13:07] <DataHoarder> 12x8TB
[02:13:07] <rmmh> that was a mistake

[16:02:48] <w1kl4s> cads yes
[16:03:26] <cads> lol, and their motto is "make software defined block storege greate again"
[16:03:59] <w1kl4s> i mean, guy that makes it really knows SDS inside out 
[16:05:10] <cads> I want to audit this code base just to see how terrified I should be about using it for my little "LowFi" self hosted VM, Kubernetes, and machine learning stack.
[16:06:42] <cads> LowFi because my gpu has 2gb memory so it can only run pissy little baby models, motherboard has 16 gb memory, and total storage is 1.2 TB
[16:13:45] <Allie> "software defined storage" is a fun set of buzzwords
[16:14:49] <cads> I think it's a basic axiom of the universe that distributed object store code looks like the diahrhea of a particularly woeful deity who, having just gorged themselves on food too spicy for their digestive tract, decides to manifest a distributed FS
[16:15:13] <Allie> cads: for single-node stuff, minio backing onto zfs is good fun
[16:15:24] <Allie> assuming you want object store stuff
[16:15:25] <joepie91> lmao
[16:15:36] <joepie91> Allie: this sounds like you have opinions on minio
[16:15:45] <cads> that said I like the vitastor codebase better than the ceph code for a simple reason: there's less of it
[16:15:50] <joepie91> I am looking for opinions on minio

[16:16:29] <Allie> well then you want ceph
[16:16:31] <joepie91> and differently-shaped
[16:17:00] <joepie91> Allie: I've seen widespread claims that it deals poorly with varyingly-sized nodes
[16:17:05] <joepie91> opinions? :p
[16:17:32] <cads> what about if some and/or most of the "servers" are really smartphones running locked android distros?
[16:18:05] <cads> plus there's a coordinating server that, for instance, pushes media to a smartphone used for listening to audiobooks
[16:18:26] <cads> which is really your "single node" desktop
[16:18:36] <Allie> joepie91: you need to reweight a lot to make it work, but it does work
[16:19:27] <Allie> like. ceph is not an automated thing. it's a thing you set up manually and then it's great
[16:19:37] <joepie91> Allie: 'reweight'?
[16:19:46] <Allie> joepie91: so ceph uses "weights" to decide where to put data

[16:20:13] <Allie> this is based on (but not exactly) drive size
[16:20:52] <Allie> you can manually reweight osds to ensure that your data is spread well across all your storage
[16:21:25] <joepie91> Allie: is this something you do when you add a node, or something you need to keep adjusting over time as your cluster is already in use?
[16:21:43] <Allie> joepie91: mostly the former, but it's good to do a weights audit every now and then
[16:22:01] <joepie91> is there a specific reason for the "but not exactly"?

[16:23:35] <cads> Allie, could ZFS do weighting between drives like that?
[16:23:39] <Allie> like. it's always best to have a homogenous storage pool 
[16:24:01] <Allie> cads: ZFS *only* allows homogenous drive sizes, and will just waste any extra space
[16:25:00] <joepie91> Allie: I'm not quite following. if a system works correctly, shouldn't the weighting *exactly* match the size of the storage system?
[16:26:24] <Allie> joepie91: yes, it should. but mine never have :P

[16:27:13] <joepie91> or, to put it differently
[16:27:26] <joepie91> how much future-me is going to hate today-me for deploying a critical data storage system on ceph
[16:28:54] <Allie> joepie91: less than how much you'll hate yourself for picking something else
[16:28:55] <Allie> ceph is best thing around for this problem
[16:29:11] <Allie> aim for homogenous storage in the future, but don't let it stop you now
[16:29:25] <Allie> use default weights and read the docs it the performance is shit
[16:29:57] <Allie> one nice thing about ceph is that you can weight an OSD to zero and it'll migrate the data off it with zero downtime
[16:30:51] <joepie91> Allie: homogenous storage will never happen in my usecase
[16:30:59] <joepie91> so any maintenance cost I incur, I will incur forever
[16:31:00] <Allie> i have even seen this used for entire DC migrations, although the performance sucks

[16:31:55] <joepie91> performance does not need to be CDN-level but needs to be acceptable

[16:34:26] <joepie91> Allie: how not-well?
[16:34:48] <joepie91> like, I'm fine with a couple roundtrips but if it takes 5 seconds to start a read request for a server 100ms away then there's a problem

[16:38:24] <joepie91> I am aware that geo block storage is hopeless

[16:40:58] <Allie> if the performance suits you, then great
[16:41:03] <Allie> it can only get better
[16:41:03] <joepie91> Allie: I mean, tahoe-lafs actually manages to do geo-distributed object storage quite well
[16:41:13] <joepie91> it does have performance problems but those do not seem to be fundamental
[16:41:17] <joepie91> but rather implementation-related
[16:41:34] <Allie> tahoe-lafs is slow tho ;)
[16:41:38] <Allie> but yeah, point taken
[16:41:42] <joepie91> yes but the reason why it is slow matters :p
[16:41:51] <joepie91> like for example the striping implementation it uses is inexplicably slow
[16:41:54] <Allie> ceph is funded and actively developed by people who care about solving this problem
[16:42:18] <joepie91> there are plenty of striping implementations that can function as basically port speed, but tahoe-lafs does not use one of those
[16:42:22] <joepie91> s/as/at/
[16:43:02] <joepie91> and there's some weirdness in its server selection that could be improved a lot
[16:43:26] <joepie91> also it doesn't consider geo proximity at all, currently
[16:43:45] <joepie91> there's lots of room for improvement on an implementation level without compromising the fundamental design of it
[16:43:55] <joepie91> so geo-distributed object storage very much looks possible to me on a fundamental level
[16:44:11] <joepie91> (even without these improvements, tahoe already almost operates within my requirements)
