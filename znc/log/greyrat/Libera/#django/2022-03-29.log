[08:50:06] <tenzai> FunkyBob: ok i got it lol it is returning since it is not yet created
[08:50:18] <tenzai> so i think ill signals instead to update it?
[08:51:16] <FunkyBob> hard to say without knowing more details
[08:51:19] <tenzai> or is it safe to use datetime.datetime.now() in my created_at field since i am using auto_now_add=True in createdfield
[08:51:24] <FunkyBob> like where you're doing this work
[08:51:37] <FunkyBob> if you're using auto_now_add it sets it on save
[08:51:58] <tenzai> how do i add 30 days or 1 year on save method?
[08:52:27] <tenzai> i have 2 conditions 1 is for 30 days and the other is for 1 year
[08:52:39] <tenzai> its like a subscription field
[08:53:14] <tenzai> what i want is to get when the object was created and + days or year on the other field
[08:53:42] <FunkyBob> yeah...
[08:53:53] <FunkyBob> but I have a question about your design... that may obviate this problem :)
[08:54:03] <tenzai> ok
[08:54:09] <FunkyBob> what will you do when they  re-subscribe?
[08:54:22] <FunkyBob> or pause their subscription?
[08:54:27] <FunkyBob> or let it lapse, and re-start it?
[08:54:36] <tenzai> hmm
[08:55:04] <tenzai> if they want to resubscrip update the expiration field?
[08:55:28] <tenzai> using datetime.datetime.now() + timedelta?
[08:56:01] <FunkyBob> i would consider a separate table to log (payment date, expiration/duration) against an acocunt
[08:56:04] <tenzai> i just want to make sure that when the key is generated or created based on their version their expiration date will be filled based on those 2 conditions
[08:56:41] <tenzai> ok let me share with you my model
[08:56:58] <FunkyBob> sure
[08:57:36] <tenzai> https://dpaste.org/7jWC
[08:58:05] <tenzai> this is only for the license table
[08:58:18] <tenzai> a different table for the subscription will be added
[08:58:35] <tenzai> i just want to bind an expiration date of every key based on their version
[08:58:48] <tenzai> if they are expired they will need to re purchase a new key
[08:58:59] <FunkyBob> but isn't the validity derived from having a valid subscription?
[09:00:11] <tenzai> well i get your point. my design is how long it will stay in the db if unused
[09:00:24] <tenzai> so i can create a chron job to delete those expired unused keys
[09:00:55] <tenzai> that validity of that key is different from the subscription
[09:01:27] <FunkyBob> ah, I see
[09:01:32] <tenzai> its just a scenario because i would like to change the pattern on how i save keys
[09:02:16] <tenzai> anyway i have another idea thanks asking it made me realize something
[09:02:22] <FunkyBob> then, yes, a post-save signal handler would be a safe place to update the validity... remember the verify created=False
[09:02:41] <tenzai> thanks bob
[09:02:46] <FunkyBob> no problem at all... you've been a delight to help :)
[09:03:01] <tenzai> thank you

[10:54:07] <dodo> if you want a wiki, just use one?
[10:54:19] <dodo> fwiw, sphinx can build static html
[10:55:37] <nesoi> can you output it as markdown or something that can be imported into a wiki? or what do you do with it?
[10:56:12] <dodo> sphinx is based on rst
[10:56:42] <dodo> with sphinx you can also build docs from the source code, class references etc. it's pretty standard in the python world too, most projects are on readthedocs which is sphinx
[10:56:56] <nesoi> right but this is private
[10:57:18] <dodo> that doesn't seem relevant to me
[10:58:03] <nesoi> isn't readthedocs public?

[11:04:37] <nesoi> true
[11:04:44] <nesoi> but an overview all in one place is handy
[11:05:29] <dodo> not sure what your goal is. you want source code docs that developers only read, not edit?

[11:06:05] <nesoi> no, I want docs that only developers and other designated people can read :)
[11:06:52] <dodo> and who edits them?
[11:06:58] <nesoi> devs
[11:07:14] <dodo> right, so a wiki seems like a poor solution because you need to switch context all the time
[11:07:54] <dodo> i use sphinx, the dev env rebuilds docs on the fly, and uat/prod get doc builds during deployment
[11:08:10] <nesoi> the overview all in one place is the sphinx output I mean
[11:08:26] <dodo> yes
[11:08:46] <nesoi> ok so the docs are a directory of HTML files in the repo?
[11:08:57] <nesoi> how do they get rebuilt?
[11:08:59] <dodo> i don't commit the build results, no
[11:09:26] <dodo> nesoi: start here https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html
[11:09:26] <nesoi> I would like devs who are not actively working on the project to be able to look at the docs
[11:09:50] <nesoi> so the output should be somewhere you can view without cloning the repo etc.
[11:10:15] <dodo> sure. like i said, i build during deployments and docs are at /docs

[13:53:07] <pgcd> Hi all
[13:53:49] <pgcd> I'm in the uncomfortable position of not being able to figure out something I'm sure everybody else has already figured out a million times over
[13:55:29] <pgcd> in short: we need E2E tests, so we're starting to use playwright - the idea is that the QA records their sessions, add a couple assertions and cleanup the code a bit, then move on
[13:56:48] *** Quits: szkl (uid110435@id-110435.uxbridge.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[13:58:34] <pgcd> the problem is that I feel like they shouldn't be testing on the "real" DB (even if it's the staging one) but they should rather do it on a test DB, and they're not developers so they have no idea how to use factories (factory-boy) properly, which means I need to set up the database for them and it should be close enough to the real one to make the
[13:58:35] <pgcd> tests meaningful
[13:59:15] <pgcd> so, the question is: how do you all deal with E2E test data? is there a smart solution that doesn't involve me hardcoding a bunch of factories?
[14:01:44] <pgcd> (worst case scenario, I'm thinking to just pull some specific data from the staging DB, but it's so much like hardcoding that I'm really hoping there are smarter ways)

[14:21:45] <vancha112[m]> does anyone know how to add GET arguments to django pagination? whenever i use a form to filter the results on a page with a list view (which is sent as POST), I have pagination which uses GET to reload the page and set the "page" url argument. But when it does so, all my filters previously sent over post are lost.
[14:26:37] <GinFuyou> vancha112[m], append them to page's urls

[16:31:58] <nikitagupta> What more is required?
[16:33:34] <GinFuyou> django is not designed for development or production, django is a web framework, runserver - is a built in development webserver
[16:33:59] <GinFuyou> so in production you start django project with another production-ready webserver

I added some instrumentation lately and it seems that iOS users frequently get CSRF error when trying to log in, like a dozen or two a day (about 10% of daily unique users). I cannot reproduce this myself, no idea how those users end up getting that error. Any ideas how I can figure it out? Or maybe there are some known issues with django/ios I sh
[18:11:20] <MapMan> ould look at?
[18:15:19] <MapMan> I would happily prepare all information that I have, such as the specific error and my site settings etc. but the question is where I should ask/post that question? Django mailing list? Or submit a ticket?
