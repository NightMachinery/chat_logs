[00:02:59] <mistiry> can you buy the actual tabasco pepper seeds?
[00:03:09] <Hunterkll> tabasco peppers yea 
[00:03:14] <mistiry> i thought they used their own cultivar or whatever
[00:03:20] <Hunterkll> it's a not uncommon strain
[00:03:21] <mistiry> didnt realize they were commercially available
[00:03:27] <Hunterkll> it's how they mix the mash and prepare it
[00:03:33] <Hunterkll> that makes the flavor
[00:03:35] <estranger> kid is freaking out.. maybe i should stop hiding in my office
[00:03:36] <estranger> sigh
[00:03:38] <Hunterkll> that and a shitload of vinegar
[00:03:39] <Kiernian> four mil? that's hotter than any peper in existence...
[00:03:44] <Kiernian> *pepper
[00:03:48] <mistiry> yes but vinegar++
[00:03:50] <estranger> concentrates 
[00:03:52] <estranger> which are nasaty 
[00:03:53] <estranger> nasty
[00:03:55] <mistiry> yeah
[00:03:56] <Kiernian> generally, yes
[00:03:56] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: it was a mix of peppers and extract
[00:04:04] <Hunterkll> called "flashbang"
[00:04:11] <Hunterkll> it actually saved someone's life
[00:04:12] <DOMF> Hunterkll, what kinda sauce do you make?
[00:04:15] <DOMF> do you ferment it?
[00:04:16] <estranger> oh ive seen flashbang.. with the grenade bottle thing
[00:04:22] <Hunterkll> caused him to have to have a seizure 
[00:04:30] <Hunterkll> and they discovered his brain cancer
[00:04:56] <Hunterkll> DOMF: nah, fresh peppers, into the mix, boil and blend
[00:05:22] <mistiry> fresh is the way
[00:05:27] <Hunterkll> seal, let sit for a year or two
[00:05:28] <Hunterkll> then use
[00:05:40] <Kiernian> some of the blair's stuff is in the multi-million range, but I wouldn't call it flavorful, in fact that's mostly the point. I'll put a few teaspoons in a pot of something when I want heat but not a change in flavor
[00:06:01] <Hunterkll> I could actually taste the different peppers in flashbang
[00:06:02] <mistiry> i dont like heat for the sake of heat. its gotta taste good.
[00:06:16] <Hunterkll> yea, a 4mil that's just extract would suck
[00:06:25] <Hunterkll> honestly i don't even like reapers
[00:06:32] <Hunterkll> i just use them to up the heat
[00:06:45] <Kiernian> sometimes I'll make a curry or whatever that has a great flavor profile that would get totally wrecked if I tossed in a dozen diced habaneros, so that's where extract comes in
[00:07:17] <estranger> reapers seem to be more hit or miss too... some are hottttt some not as much
[00:07:33] <Hunterkll> estranger: all of mine are fucking lit
[00:07:37] <estranger> I think scorps give a more even heat plant to plant
[00:07:40] <Hunterkll> but i used fish oil every 2 days
[00:07:48] <Hunterkll> on the ground
[00:07:51] <estranger> reapers have gotten better though in consistency over the years
[00:08:00] <sd> 12<S​obia> Just extract is 16 mil

[00:10:29] <mistiry> pickled ive never had any i liked. ive only had one or two fermented sauces, and didnt like them. so my sample size isn't very large.
[00:10:49] <Hunterkll> mistiry: not even pickled jalapenos ?
[00:10:56] <mistiry> i dont like regular jalapenos
[00:11:04] <Hunterkll> ah okay
[00:11:10] <DOMF> I mean pickled SHOULD mean fermented
[00:11:11] <Hunterkll> i like 'em with regular pickles

[00:12:50] <Hunterkll> simmering 
[00:12:51] <mistiry> i tried one or two others that just werent right
[00:12:52] <DOMF> Huy Fong got in a huge lawsuit with the city they make sriracha in because their fermentation was causing noxious capsaicin clouds
[00:13:19] <Hunterkll> @Kiernian: i use the seeds for... well, this year's crop actually
[00:13:23] <Hunterkll> and flavoring
[00:13:23] <DOMF> Huy Fong just uses fermented red jalapenos, traditionally it's seranos, I use lots
[00:13:32] <Hunterkll> but not for sauce
[00:13:35] <shakygator> DOMF "its just allergies"
[00:13:46] <DOMF> lol
[00:13:48] <Hunterkll> mistiry: that picture smoked out my entire family 
[00:13:49] <Kiernian> I suppose that's fair. As long as you're not just throwing them out.
[00:13:56] <mistiry> Hunterkll: oh i believe it
[00:14:05] <mistiry> making mace over there
[00:14:14] <Kiernian> my general opinion is that anyone who can't handle the pepper with the seeds in it should be using a weaker pepper, but if you need them to grow more...
[00:14:16] <Hunterkll> that's 25% vinegar, some water, and well, simering peppers
[00:14:38] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: making sauce home made, you can't seed it
[00:14:40] <Hunterkll> sadly
[00:14:45] <mistiry> i take out seeds cuz i dont like seeds
[00:14:48] <Hunterkll> i don't have an industrial fuck you blender
[00:14:50] <mistiry> same reason i dont eat strawberries
[00:15:40] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: my death nachos - https://i.imgur.com/NURtimd.jpg
[00:15:46] <mistiry> also isnt most of the heat in the flesh, not the seeds?
[00:15:51] <Hunterkll> you can see why i call it that
[00:15:51] <mistiry> why the obsession with the seeds/
[00:15:52] <Hunterkll> :D
[00:15:53] <mistiry> ?
[00:16:00] <Hunterkll> mistiry: flavor & heat
[00:16:03] <Hunterkll> it's a mix
[00:16:13] <mistiry> i dont think there is capsaicin in the seeds
[00:16:34] <mistiry> or enough to matter
[00:16:38] <Hunterkll> idk, they make it taste hotter
[00:16:51] <Hunterkll> but maybe that's because i'm eating whole peppers at a time
[00:16:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:17:23] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: my last crop... https://i.imgur.com/pQesvCD.jpg
[00:17:23] <mistiry> yeah no capsaicin in the seeds as far as a few sources i found so far
[00:17:39] <Kiernian> niiiice. Look at that soil.
[00:17:41] <Hunterkll> all that wonderful red \o/

[00:19:14] <Kiernian> the heat is NOT in the seeds, it's in what the seeds are attached to, which also gets removed when most people de-seed peppers

[00:20:57] <mistiry> i also like to mix. red and yellow, or pink and yellow

[07:09:30] <Shiromara> just wanted to ask an ipsec question.. anyone up for it?

[07:11:33] <Shiromara> maybe it sounds familiar to someone.. ipsec connection to BO seems to be limited to 30Mbps
[07:12:20] <misspwn> surely the network folks are not lurking to deep
[07:12:27] <Shiromara> HQ has 300 symmetric, Branch office has 100/50
[07:12:56] <misspwn> DrGibby, i am doggy paddlin in a laundry basket full of baby shit, but otherwise doin fab. how r u bb
[07:13:07] <Shiromara> tried asking on the discord channel. but all i get is crickets ^^
[07:13:12] <misspwn> ok Shiromara what are you trying to do?
[07:14:02] <Shiromara> eh, the vpn is working. just that the traffic between sites is somehow limited to 30 MBit
[07:14:12] <Shiromara> HQ has 300/300, Branch has 100/50
[07:14:47] <misspwn> what type of equpiment are you working with
[07:15:02] <Shiromara> i thought maybe it's an encryption issue as one site is a fortigate 80f and the other is a pfsense i3 540
[07:15:12] <Shiromara> so first gen with no AES-NI
[07:15:48] <Shiromara> i'll just quote from my #networking question in discord "any idea why a ipsec-vpn connection seems to be limited to 30 Mbit? - Is it really the lack of AES-NI on one side?(left side fortigate 80f - right side supermicro pfsense [i3 540]  P1: AES-256GCM  DF 14 - PRFSHA256 ; P2 AES256GCM - SHA256 DF 14 PFS"
[07:17:46] <Shiromara> we are going to buy another fw on the right side (forti) but with the delivery delays atm it will take quite some time
[07:18:09] <Shiromara> so i hoped i can kinda fix it in the mean time
[07:19:04] <Shiromara> for the encryption standards.. they are all from the "BSI"
[07:20:40] <Shiromara> when i put load on it. it doesn't seem like it is cpu limited
[07:21:39] <Shiromara> by dashboard 60% - by load 2-3
[07:22:27] <misspwn> i think it might be beneficial to check to see if on Either side if there is a limiter configured for inbound/outbound traffic
[07:22:49] <Shiromara> did that already. it's pretty much an all - all

[18:35:25] <SirSceptalot> PublicWifi, I'm not following... The point of a battery is to be able to extract power that you put into it. If the car doesnt' support car-to-grid, what are you going to do, build a giant hmaster wheel for it?

[18:43:38] <PattyCakes> they'd be at 80% forever
[18:43:42] <PublicWifi> yeah...

[19:50:01] <DrGibby> nah
[19:50:04] <JollyRgrs> then we have users like @hxcsp that left irc for discord and are worse off for it (they are, not irc)
[19:50:10] <DrGibby> more of a feature than a bug
[19:50:28] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> i just consolidated jolly
[19:50:38] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> this was literally the only place i still used irc
[19:50:40] <mistiry> iirc there are stupid control characters around the relayed messages or something like that that makes it a bitch to parse

[19:51:25] <JollyRgrs> i still have a handful for when I need help with a specific topic
[19:51:35] <JollyRgrs> not everyone moved to skype
[19:51:58] <mistiry> was IRC for most things until discord, then some places hopped over there
[19:51:59] <JollyRgrs> i think i've used skype, personally, less than 10 times... ever
[19:52:04] <mistiry> same
[19:52:07] <mistiry> probably less than 5
[19:52:18] <JollyRgrs> yeah, i hate that some support groups moved to discord. i get it... but it isn't the same
[19:52:37] <mistiry> im in FAR fewer places nowadays on IRC tho
[19:52:42] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> skype gross
[19:52:46] <mistiry> only on libera, and only in a handful of channels
[19:52:48] <JollyRgrs> having 12 "channels" in your discord just makes everything so siloed and lonely
[19:53:19] <mistiry> because they try to make every little topic its own channel
[19:53:41] <mistiry> hence you have separate things for windows, linux, networking, authentication, powershell, bash, etc.
[19:53:53] <mistiry> instead of a generalized channel like we are on IRC
[19:54:57] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> well thats how you had 800 people in the channel

[19:55:16] <JollyRgrs> yup
[19:55:17] <mistiry> there wasnt anything wrong with having 800 people
[19:55:20] <mistiry> but it wasnt 800 active people
[19:55:43] <JollyRgrs> 800 ppl in a channel means more people to chime in when they know something to help... or more people asking questions and keeping teh channel active
[19:55:50] <mistiry> channel is 12 years old, more than a decade on freenode, so having orphaned clients and idlers is expected

[20:27:28] <thegodsquirrel> its like $5.99 sometimes for groceries, but they sub stuff with varying levels of proficiency
[20:27:34] <fritzwastaken> was like 45$ for 2 burgers and a thing of fries from 5 guys
[20:27:37] <teh_f4ll3n> only a 10h flight

[21:28:17] <fritzwastaken> rdp to your work laptop?

[22:12:28] <Kiernian> the part of me that likes dumpsterfires is the part of me that's fed by success and progress. If they're really all THAT bad, it's usually pretty easy to find something to fix successfully.

[23:08:53] <sd> 08<G​ene> oh, and make it the middle salary of the 3 jobs...
[23:08:56] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Exactly why I'm changing jobs. Also I do not like software development. At least not how it's being coordinated in my current position.
[23:09:11] <fritzwastaken> Imagine being a UI/UX person
[23:09:16] <sd> 08<G​ene> it bothers me software dev makes more than ops, but just is life
[23:09:25] <sd> 08<G​ene> you mean an artist that can encode text?
[23:09:44] <sd> 12<S​obia> I feel like a lot more people are in a DevOps role and they don't know it.
[23:09:54] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> We do that TOO! Sitting through a UI/UX design meeting is literally one of Dante's circles of Hell.
[23:10:13] <PublicWifi> UI/UX guy means you are def an artist
[23:10:15] <PublicWifi> :D
[23:10:30] <sd> 08<G​ene> UX can approach engineering, but UI is entirely artist.
[23:10:46] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> I should hire an artist to make comics about tech sysadmin stuff and write a blog
[23:10:52] <sd> 08<G​ene> yes.
[23:10:52] <bomb> PublicWifi how is devops different than a softawre engineer who can deploy shit?
[23:11:06] <sd> 08<G​ene> when devs break prod servers, they only have themselves to call
[23:12:04] <PublicWifi> ask some of the devops guys
[23:12:19] <PublicWifi> most of them tell me its a lot of software dev skills plus a lot of sysadmin skills
[23:12:22] <sd> 12<S​obia> I think a lot of devops guys still don't know what makes them devops guys
[23:12:29] <PublicWifi> lots of newer devops guys lack common stuff like networking skills
[23:12:35] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Our company uses MSP to fund the Software Development. But it's very hard to find people that can write code and be Sysadmins.
[23:12:40] <PublicWifi> or.. DNS knowledge
[23:12:41] <PublicWifi> lol
[23:12:42] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> And will accept entry level pay.
[23:12:51] <PublicWifi> that last line is key
[23:12:53] <PublicWifi> xD
[23:12:57] <mistiry> absolutely
[23:13:20] <sd> 12<S​obia> My understanding is devops is basically developers + sysadmin + Management Responsibilities
[23:13:35] <mistiry> not for me
[23:13:45] <bomb> PublicWifi I imagined devops as a sysadmin with strong programming background, and programs for the sysadmin tasks, and not the product itself
[23:13:48] <mistiry> esp. not management responsiblities. i left my last job to get _away_ from managing.
[23:13:56] <sd> 12<S​obia> Those devops peeps need to generate reports and talk to the other departments.
[23:14:13] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Yep! I did at first, because I lacked any experience and would never have landed anything more than a help desk position. But I put in my time, and now I'm a week away from transitioning to a SysAdmin position that comes with a 35k raise.
[23:14:18] <sd> 12<S​obia> Not so much managing employees, but being the glue between other departments and their own. idk what I want to say here but you get it
[23:14:47] <bomb> glue boy, basically
[23:14:52] <sd> 12<S​obia> Glue Boy!
[23:15:08] <mistiry> not what i do, but sure

[23:15:25] <sd> 08<G​ene> iirc, devops *do* work directly on products too
[23:15:37] <sd> 12<S​obia> Ahahah YYESS I love office space
[23:16:32] <sd> 04<n​odes> Does anyone use Elasticsearch at their company?
[23:16:56] <shakygator> yes
[23:17:13] <sd> 08<G​ene> i used it for SIEM [elasticstack] in the past
[23:17:27] <sd> 04<n​odes> Do you pay for the cloud version, or were you one of the fortunate to have it installed on-prem?
[23:18:07] <sd> 08<G​ene> i installed it when it was still an ELK stack
[23:18:21] * Cl0udNinja sticks more hotdogs in PublicWifi's ports
[23:18:43] <sd> 04<n​odes> Ahh gotcha.  Looking into the cloud version (which seems easier to manage), due to having ZERO success getting it installed locally.
[23:19:53] <sd> 08<G​ene> what are you planning on doing with the nosql database?
[23:20:18] <sd> 04<n​odes> ?
[23:20:32] <sd> 08<G​ene> what's the use case for elasticsearch for you?
[23:22:13] <sd> 04<n​odes> Logging and SIEM Mainly. Currently using Wazuh (the easily deployable version of ELK) and I’d like a bit more functionality out of it.
[23:22:27] <sd> 08<G​ene> greylog is an easy to deploy solution too iirc
[23:22:39] <sd> 08<G​ene> graylog* D:
[23:23:34] <PublicWifi> :o
[23:23:49] <sd> 04<n​odes> does it have the ability to see what IPs are hitting a machine and to geo-locate them?
[23:24:21] <sd> 08<G​ene> https://www.graylog.org/post/how-to-set-up-graylog-geoip-configuration
[23:24:33] <sd> 08<G​ene> > Graylog lets you extract and visualize Geolocation information from IP addresses in your logs.
[23:24:36] * fritzwastaken grabs popcorn
[23:25:28] <sd> 04<n​odes> Gotcha.  This is sort of what i'm referring to: https://www.elastic.co/security
[23:25:55] <sd> 04<n​odes> It's got a bunch of different integrations that run on the endpoints to log the information.
[23:26:08] <sd> 08<G​ene> graylog technically uses elasticsearch too
[23:26:49] <sd> 08<G​ene> if i were interested in time-series metrics rather than specific logs, I'd probably use prometheus
[23:27:06] <sd> 08<G​ene> https://prometheus.io/
