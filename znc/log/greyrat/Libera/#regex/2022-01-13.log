[01:34:13] <control> hello, im trying to run regex which finds only words containing specified letters in length of 10 - heres the example https://regex101.com/r/jhZmbY/1
[01:34:58] <control> currently it finds all of the words with letters containing. i only need to find words length of 10 for containing all of the letters specified
[01:42:13] <mysticspiral[m]> https://regex101.com/r/jhZmbY/2
[01:42:14] <mysticspiral[m]> bulky yet simple solution
[01:45:21] <control> hit works, but if word contains other characters it also finds

[08:16:30] <oscurochu> hi
[08:16:39] <Me-me> Am not.
[08:17:55] <oscurochu> i want to search "export blah blah" but not "export module blah blah" or "export default blah blah" 
[08:18:08] <oscurochu> ^export [^(default|module?)](.*)
[08:18:23] <Me-me> No, [] is a character class and matches a single character.
[08:18:34] <Me-me> () and | inside are treated literally.
[08:18:41] <Me-me> /export (?!module|default)(.*)
[08:18:44] <Me-me> /export (?!module|default)(.*)/
[08:18:58] <oscurochu> why the slashes?
[08:19:19] <Me-me> Those are the delimiters. They denote the start and end of a regex pattern.
[08:19:27] <oscurochu> thanks it works
[08:19:30] <Me-me> I forgot to add the ^ as well.
[08:19:35] <Me-me> But you probably saw that already.
[08:19:51] <oscurochu> where do i put the ^?
[08:19:57] <oscurochu> at pos 0?
[08:20:13] <Me-me> ^ means "the start of the string" or with multiline mode, the start of the line instead.
[08:20:21] <Me-me> So yes, position 0. The same place you put it in your attempt.

[08:21:36] <oscurochu> so i used babel import/export syntax. im not actually using babel, because its in the backend. 
[08:21:42] <oscurochu> i wrote this ugly mess ^import([ ]+)(.*)([ ]+)from([ ]+)'(.*)';$
[08:21:56] <oscurochu> in case there are more than once spcae
[08:21:58] <oscurochu> space
[08:22:12] <Me-me> Any particular reason you're capturing the spaces?
[08:22:30] <oscurochu> because im a noob lol 
[08:22:37] <Me-me> I'll allow it.
[08:23:12] <Me-me> So are you doing anything at all with the captured text?
[08:23:42] <oscurochu> just the (.*) part
[08:23:48] <Me-me> There are two of those.
[08:24:40] <oscurochu> i need to capture X in "import X from 'X'
[08:24:54] <Me-me> ^import (.*) from +'([^'\n]*)';$
[08:27:48] <oscurochu> i would like it to work with this example, lets say i have an accidental extra space or two... https://dpaste.com/G4TMDGGM8
[08:28:23] <Me-me> Can you make it fail on regex101.com so I can see it?

[08:30:22] <Me-me> But.
[08:30:25] <Me-me> You want to trim the spaces as well?
[08:30:40] <oscurochu> my code should be doing that, i just need those two values.
[08:30:47] <oscurochu> but im not getting them 
[08:30:52] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/y5RZvl/1 There's also this.
[08:30:59] <Me-me> Which will trim the spaces by itself.
[08:32:08] <Me-me> It gets even simpler if there's only one word in betweeen "import" and "from" - the patterns I've given are for multiples.
[08:32:49] <oscurochu> that regex *should* work. it works on that sandbox. but its not working with my code... i just dont understand lol im also new to python so that doesnt help either
[08:33:08] <Me-me> I don't know python, but you could take a look at the code generator to see if that helps locate the problem?
[08:42:03] <Me-me> !codegen
[08:42:04] <perlbot> Select code generator on the left side of regex101 to view sample code for your language of choice.
[08:42:57] <oscurochu> part of the reason it wasnt working is because i commented part of the code out.... *facepalm*
[08:43:41] <Me-me> That'll do it.
[08:44:51] <oscurochu> what kind of jobs do you learn regex? 
[08:45:05] <oscurochu> or use regex for rather
[08:46:32] <oscurochu> i just want to get really good at regex, its such a pain not knowing it at all.
