[00:04:38] <mkf> hi all.
[00:08:27] <mkf> does using 'Language = foo' on a specfic user on znc config affects web interface langauge for that user?
[00:08:54] <DarthGandalf> why are you editing config directly?
[00:09:13] <DarthGandalf> language is editable from webadmin
[00:10:42] <mkf> i've changed it from web admin, and i can see it on config, but i still see everything (webadmin, help messages) in english.

[00:12:03] <DarthGandalf> what language? not all languages are 100% translated
[00:12:59] <DarthGandalf> you can see coverage at https://crowdin.com/project/znc-bouncer
[00:14:32] <mkf> ah yes. that's understandable. but since this happend on all of language, i don't think problem is related to there. (znc -v says i18n = yes)
[00:14:45] <DarthGandalf> which language?
[00:15:13] <DarthGandalf> if znc -v said "i18n no", you wouldn't be able to select the language in UI at all
[00:16:37] <mkf> i've tried ru-RU de-DE fr-FR.
[00:16:53] <DarthGandalf> hm
[00:17:24] <DarthGandalf> did you set it for a different user perhaps?
[00:18:06] <mkf> i don't know. this config only has one user.
[00:18:16] <mkf> is it possible to set it globally?
[00:19:33] <DarthGandalf> strange
[00:21:55] <DarthGandalf> version? try updating?

[10:08:15] *** Quits: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)

[10:12:01] <luiserebii> I see, thank you... I've found it on the webpage.
[10:13:45] <luiserebii> This will sound like a very naive question. I want to see the last several messages from a channel from my IRC client... will I be able to, just connecting to znc? or will i have to enable znc logging, and perform some magic afterwards?
[10:14:10] <luiserebii> In such a way where I could, for example, on Irssi, hit PgUp and see the previous messages?
[10:14:25] <luiserebii> Or would I have to read directly from the znc logs?

[23:20:56] <LjL> after adding a few modules including route_replies to znc.conf yesterday since i realized i had them for freenode but not for libera (at least i think the issue started after that), i kept getting disconnected with my client saying no ping for 89 seconds, and *route_replies complaining in this fashion: https://paste.ee/p/o8TCM - not i removed route_replies and it's working stably again, the wiki says to report it if it says "This module hit a timeout. This is a BUG!" 
[23:20:56] <LjL> but that's not what i'm getting, but still, any obvious reason for this or for further investigation?

[23:34:41] <DarthGandalf> LjL: shouldn't cause timeouts. Probably just a coincident that your network connection improved at the same time you unloaded it

[23:45:21] <Netboy3> LjL: i'm using route_replies and only had those notifications when the network was truly unreachable or flapping. thing is that route_replies's pinging/timeout mechanism is sensitive so it might expose network issues you have and were not aware of
[23:46:35] <LjL> i don't think so... my network connection is *now* having issues, ironically, but that's very visibly different. IRC was just unusable with the module loaded, consistently, at least with HexChat and Revolution IRC connected to it
[23:46:55] <LjL> note i wasn't getting disconnected from IRC, just from ZNC
[23:47:01] <LjL> i mean, the ZNC wasn't getting disconnected from IRC
[23:47:30] <LjL> well, i'm connecting via mobile data to my home server, so there's plenty of opportunities for the network to be dodgy, for sure
