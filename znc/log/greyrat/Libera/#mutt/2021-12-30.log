[01:24:54] <rkta> kevin8t8: :cd doesn't seem to have tab completion, how much work would it be to add it? I assume it's not easy, otherwise you would already have added this.
[01:26:09] <kevin8t8> rkta: may not be a lot of work, I may have just neglected to add it.  will take a look.
[01:27:08] <rkta> kevin8t8: if you have pointers, I can take a look if I can add create a patch, if you want.
[01:27:17] <rkta> s/add//
[01:32:12] <kevin8t8> rkta: ah wait, the current mutt completion is when you are *just* entering a filename/mailbox and that's a special mode of the input line
[01:32:43] <kevin8t8> rkta: :cd is entered via the generic "enter command" prompt.
[01:33:40] <kevin8t8> rkta: there isn't a position based completion in mutt currently, so this may be some work.  I'll take a lot later on to make sure I'm not missing something though.
[01:34:40] <rkta> kevin8t8: ! has tab completion, but is executed in a subshell. Can we use code from there?
[01:35:47] <rkta> If I can help, let me know.
[01:38:16] <kevin8t8> rkta: looks like there is some positional completion, so there is hope.
[01:38:59] <kevin8t8> mutt_command_complete() does some stuff for set and exec
[01:39:50] <rkta> Would be great. Piping patches is quite a pain if the directory has a weird/long name.
[01:40:13] <kevin8t8> rkta: I'll add to my list.  it does look feasible.
[01:40:35] <rkta> kevin8t8: thanks
