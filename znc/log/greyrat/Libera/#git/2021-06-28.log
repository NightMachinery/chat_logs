[05:20:00] <blahboybaz> Is there some secret I'm missing out on? What happens when you have to do a bunch of stuff with git, or you have to use it very frequently over a long period of time (hours)? Do you you really have to keep typing the word "git" at the beginning of each command or is there some tool, plugin, something that solved that?
[05:21:36] <BtbN> solved what?
[05:21:42] <BtbN> If you want to invoke git, you got to invoke git.
[05:27:17] <fnurkla> if you're using git from the command line you can always add short aliases for common commands
[05:27:51] <fnurkla> in your shell and/or in git
[05:27:56] <nedbat> blahboybaz: i use an alias of "g"
[05:28:45] <pcarphin> blahboybaz Get used to typing git a lot.  It would be trivially easy to make something like a "git shell" where you would type commands without the leading "git".  No one has made it because it just wouldn't be that useful since you pretty much always have non-git commands to do between the git commands.
[05:28:45] <pcarphin> And you can make aliases, but I don't.
[05:29:35] <fnurkla> pcarphin: I think somebody has made that

[12:41:07] <cxl> Hi all, I'm having an issue with a git repo. I have a branch which I've pushed already (but haven't merged). In this branch, I have committed a file I'd rather not. I tried removing it with `git filter-repo --invert-paths --path filename`, but this fails on the branch (it says it's not a freshly cloned repo). So I tried cloning the repo in a new directory and checkout the branch, run the same command and got the
[12:41:13] <cxl> same error. I tried with --force and it did the job, but now I can't push anymore because it doesn't know the origin (weird) so I add it back. Then I have to `git push --set-upstream origin mybranch` but it refuses with stale info error. I tried to push force but I can't either... I have a backup of the repo before I started doing all this, so how should I go about removing that file from the branch and pushing
[12:41:18] <cxl> that?

[16:47:27] <Guest26> Hi. Some thought about "git switch". Trying to find out, if this has been discussed before, or if not maybe where to post/request it?  git switch -C existing-branch  some-commit => if the old commit(s) in existing-branch are NOT part of any other branch, then they will be dropped. For "newbies" this is not clear, nor do newbies know the reflog.
[16:47:28] <Guest26> Maybe git switch should (configurable) warn or refuse, if commits are to be dropped?
[16:47:38] *** Quits: quiexotic (~quiexotic@user/quiexotic) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:49:04] <henk> Guest26: -C is --force-create and 'force' indicates that it may/will overwrite stuff and should be used with care IMHO â€¦ Iâ€™d assume it refuses with -c, i.e. without 'force'

[17:46:35] <sleepy_galileo> I think I know what caused the problem! I accidentally commited an environment file with some secrets. I used the BFG Repo-Cleaner to get rid of passwords in the local repo on my desktop. I followed their instructions and pushed it to origin. Then I cloned it again on my desktop. But obviously I forgot to do it on my laptop.
[17:47:14] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[17:47:50] <sleepy_galileo> @igemnace: sure, you are right. It was the cleanup I did and completely forgot about. Thanks for your help.
[17:47:58] <pcarphin> This is quite likely the reason for your problems, the BFT with improper updates on other clones.
[17:48:48] <sleepy_galileo> They advice to clone a fresh version for everybody involved. This obviously also includes every device involved as well! :D
[17:48:48] <pcarphin> I would recommend, especially in situations like this, to do `git fetch` followed by checking things out, followed by `git merge` if that's what you need to do.
[17:49:29] <sleepy_galileo> makes sense. I will just flatten to local version and clone it again. no big issue. Just completely forgot about it.
[17:49:37] *** Quits: hmmmas (~chenqisu1@183.217.200.246) (Quit: Leaving.)
[17:49:39] <pcarphin> and after "checking things out", you may realize that what you want to do is something else than `git merge`.  Doing `git pull` doesn't give you that opportunity.
[17:50:06] <igemnace> well, you don't necessarily need a fresh clone. if you're positive that the remote state is what you want (you won't be losing anything by discarding your current local branch), you can simply reset --hard to the remote state. e.g. git reset --hard @{u} with develop checked out
[17:51:09] <sleepy_galileo> ok. I'll give it a try. Not much to loose on the current state of the local repo currently.
[17:51:13] <pcarphin> You would have done `git fetch`, then `git status` would tell you "Your branch and the remote have diverged by 1000 commits" at which point, you can do what igemnace is saying.  (However if what he says scares you, you can do a fresh clone instead).
[17:51:48] <sleepy_galileo> I'll try it and report back. Thanks
[17:52:09] <pcarphin> BTW igemnace thanks for `git reset --hard @{u}` :D

[21:44:33] <imMute> I like Azure Dev Ops more, but it's pretty complicated compared to the others, and the free tier is pretty limited.
[21:44:41] <ikke> norias: no
[21:44:47] <norias> ah
[21:44:48] <ikke> well, gitlab you can probably
[21:44:55] <imMute> norias: you can sell hosting / support / management of them
[21:45:06] <imMute> selling the software itself might be tricky since users would be able to get it for free anyway
[21:45:17] <norias> imMute: that's .. yeah, an interesting idea.

[22:25:59] <orutherfurd> hi, git status is telling me i staged a file for deletion (which i didn't) and I can't unstage it: https://gist.github.com/orutherfurd/787d5ba8c1a6aaf5ab803ad0caa45ae3
[22:27:43] <ikke> orutherfurd: try git checkout HEAD fabfile.py
[22:27:54] <cbreak> orutherfurd: git reset
[22:28:10] <ikke> cbreak: git reset does not bring the file back
[22:28:21] <cbreak> it's no wonder that restoring from staged will not do, since the deletion is staged
[22:28:29] <cbreak> reset will unstage the deletion
[22:28:36] <cbreak> ikke: he didn't say the file was gone
[22:28:36] <orutherfurd> the file is in the working directory
[22:28:47] <ikke>  deleted:    fabfile.py
[22:29:02] <cbreak> ikke: that's just the staging area
[22:30:27] <orutherfurd> and `git restore --staged fabfile.py` had no effect
[22:31:20] <ikke> like cbreak said, it's not in the staging area, so you cannot restore it from there

[22:32:13] <orutherfurd> but it's also not missing from the working directory - the file hasn't changed
[22:32:26] <cbreak> I'd just use git reset.

[22:33:00] <pratyush> Hi all, I have a patch whose commit message contains the diff header "diff --git...". git am trips up and thinks this is the start of the diff and tells me that the patch is invalid

[22:33:24] <pratyush> ?

[22:33:50] <ikke> use apply for that
[22:34:06] <pratyush> No, it is a patch created using git-format-patch
[22:34:11] <ikke> ah, I see what you mean
[22:34:12] <orutherfurd> it says other changes where unstaged, but still says fabfile.py is deleted
