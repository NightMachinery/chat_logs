[00:49:04] <Ionic> Given a file with multiple video tracks, can I somehow tell ffmpeg to recode only of them and pass the others through (essentially using the copy mechanism)? I guess I could split the file up first, then recode individually and then remux later, but isn't there a one-step solution to this?
[00:50:26] <jarthur> You can definitely do this. All options pertaining to the processing and output of the video stream can be given stream-specific identifiers. so -codec:v:0 libx264 -codec:v:1 copy -codec:v:2 copy

[00:58:46] <galex-713> hello, why are p-frames useful, compared to i- and b-frames? i mean, i understand they should be for performance, and seeking, but why if using -g 0 hence only b-frames my files get bigger?
[01:01:28] <Ionic> In a nutshell, I frames are full images, while B and P frames are intra and predictive coded pictures which aren't resolvable without their previous or future dependencies.
[01:02:33] <galex-713> oh sorry, i confused i frames and p frames then (i thought «i» standed for «inter-» or «intra-», and «p» for «picture»)
[01:03:02] *** Quits: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:03:33] <Ionic> Err, I stands for intra, which is a full frame, while B stands for bidirectional coded picture and P for predictive coded picture. My bad.
[01:04:16] <galex-713> ooooooooooooooooooh that’s whyyyyyyy
[01:04:23] <Ionic> I frames are full images, P frames only need information from previous P or I frames, B frames need information from previous OR following frames.
[01:04:32] <galex-713> so when I did -g 0 it actually used no prediction!
[01:04:41] <galex-713> is there a way to specify i want to reencode a video using *only* b-frames?
[01:04:58] <Ionic> Yeah, you're essentially saving each frame as full image which defeats most saving video codecs can achieve.
[01:04:58] <galex-713> b frames or p frames
[01:05:13] <galex-713> without doing -g <enormous integer that perhaps doesn’t even fits on 32bits>
[01:05:21] <Ionic> Uhm if you set the group of pictures very high... but I wouldn't do that.
[01:05:27] <galex-713> why?
[01:05:46] <galex-713> if the video is smol or almost not changing (like only a static picture looping for 30 secs)
[01:05:47] <Ionic> Seeking would essentially be fully impossible. Also think of decoding errors.
[01:05:58] <galex-713> what decoding errors?
[01:06:06] <galex-713> can’t it seek by recalculating frames?
[01:06:38] <Ionic> That depends on the video player and even if they do, I'd be very slow.

[01:20:59] <galex-713> to me there’s an issue somewhere, but i can’t get which one
[01:22:08] <Ionic> Well, technically you're creating a proper H264 video stream there. Maybe you're just using the wrong encoder. Not the "wrong" one, but one which doesn't fit your needs well enough.
[01:23:45] <galex-713> but why isn’t a so widespread encoder able to detect nothing is changing? and are there so many h264 encoders?
[01:24:09] <galex-713> or is there some tweak parameter i could pass to libx264 to make it search harder for such situation?
[01:24:34] <galex-713> i mean detecting strict identity shouldn’t be that expensive right?
[01:24:45] <galex-713> i’m sure i’m wrong, but very curious about where
[01:25:40] <Ionic> You'll always have container and encoding overhead even if no data is actually changing. I'm not talking about H264 encoders, but more like codecs which would rather do what you actually want, i.e., save off one frame and reference this as repeating X times. I'm just not sure what codec would do that. MJPEG maybe?

[01:27:10] <Ionic> But then the video player would need to support that codec as well, which limits the usefulness.
[01:27:31] <galex-713> Ionic: I tried 30secs and 5 minutes and the size is proportional to the duration, so ig it’s not that much the container…? or… oh… maybe just saying «nothing changed» might take space right…

[01:27:45] <galex-713> you still have to use some space for each frame i guess
[01:27:51] <Ionic> Yep.

[01:28:59] <galex-713> I wish it was possible to just say «nothing to say for n frames» without having to store info for each frame… is that a container limitation?
[01:29:56] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[01:31:38] <Ionic> Quite so. A very simple container could encode that in 5K + 8 bytes for a 64 bit unsigned integer specifying how many times that image should repeat, naturally, but I'm not aware of any standard containers supporting such a feature.

[01:32:20] <galex-713> well not necessarily in only one uint, but at least in constant space
[01:32:42] <galex-713> even if it was, say, 20k, it might be ok as long as those 20k would stay the same for 30secs or 2 hours
[01:35:20] <Ionic> Yeah, I catch your drift, I'm just not aware of anything that would support this. Probably because it's not used often. And, frankly, because 200 KByte vs. 5 Kbyte doesn't matter much either.
[01:35:53] <galex-713> wait but there are indeed 6 h264 encoders within ffmpeg…
[01:36:52] <galex-713> Ionic: the image is reaaaally lowres, i think for HD pictures and surveillance videocameras of very wide landscapes over long times it might matters a lot
[01:37:25] <Ionic> And probably none of them will lower the size enough for you, because H264 just isn't the right codec for the job at hand. :)
[01:37:34] <furq> are you sure you don't just want vfr
[01:37:37] <galex-713> i mean if only 2% of the image move 2% of the time… i’d like that to be exploited… but i wouldn’t imagine a whole new codec would be needed for that, i thought the very principle of b/p-frames would make that really cheap

[01:38:14] <galex-713> can x264 do that?

[01:38:50] <galex-713> right?
[01:38:50] <furq> well for starters you need a vfr input
[01:39:04] <furq> if you don't have one then look at something like -vf mpdecimate
[01:39:05] <galex-713> as showed my cli my input was a single jpg

[01:40:00] <galex-713> because I guess some calculations have to be done for that, and it’s the encoder of surveillance cameras that do it right?
[01:40:04] <furq> well for a single repeating image it doesn't make any sense to go vfr, you would just use a very low framerate
[01:40:12] <galex-713> or do they also embed motion detectors to change framerate??
[01:40:19] <furq> for something like a camera you would just not bother sending any frames that are too similar to the last one

[02:36:13] <ptr727> Hi, new here, apologies for not knowing what I'm doing. Looking for help on getting "closed_captions" tag working in ffprobe. I found a patch that was abandoned, but as far as I could tell this is an issue that could be resolved, even if just for parity with text output vs. JSON output. Please see here for details:

[20:14:54] <haasn> is there a way to strip stream-level side data from the `ffmpeg` command line
[20:15:15] <haasn> ffmpeg -c copy in.mkv out.mkv preserves it ("side_data_type": "DOVI configuration record")
[20:18:19] <JEEB> you probably mean the correct way of writing that :) (since you're setting the decoder to copy there)
[20:19:22] *** Quits: NaviTheFairy (~Squirrel@user/navithefairy) (Quit: Oh no. A thing broke.)
[20:19:28] <JEEB> anyways, seems like no. there's a loop in init_output_stream which is not conditional as far as I can tell
[20:19:52] <JEEB> various bits of the side data management aren't really fledged out in ffmpeg.c
[20:20:26] <JEEB> I love it how it just has a exception on AV_PKT_DATA_CPB_PROPERTIES
[20:20:31] <JEEB> if not that, copy it into output
[20:20:36] <haasn> poo
[20:20:45] <haasn> JEEB: in this case the use case is transcoding from dovi to non-dovi
[20:20:50] <haasn> in which case we obviously don't want to encode the config record
[20:20:52] <JEEB> yea
[20:22:12] <haasn> sounds like we need to have an option in the spirit of -metadata / -map_metadata which can also apply to stream-level data
[20:22:20] <haasn> or perhaps those options can be made to include stream-level metadata as well somehow
[20:23:24] <JEEB> yea for metadata-equivalent you need something like string->side data object, and then map metadata equivalent being in some way similar
[20:24:07] <JEEB> I bet if various HDR metadata also end up in AVStream, it will get poked as well.
[20:24:25] <haasn> is there a way we could somehow suppress the writing of a dovi config record if no dovi rpu was found in the frames to be written
[20:24:41] <haasn> or is that metadata written/locked in before we get any frames
[20:26:13] <JEEB> video encoders I made to be initialized with the first video AVFrame at least
[20:27:35] <JEEB> init_output_stream_encode is what initializes encoders (and where AVFrame is passed) and this if (ist)  thing is after that
