[22:24:19] <Activ8> a Lenovo m93p
[22:24:21] <PublicWiFi> sorry for the 1000 questions
[22:24:25] <Activ8> purchased it for 70 bucks
[22:24:42] <PublicWiFi> as nice
[22:24:44] <Activ8> 256gb sss and I don’t even use 30gb of it
[22:24:51] <Activ8> ssd*
[22:25:22] <Activ8> runs caddy web server, open vpn, the lounge chat client 
[22:25:48] <Activ8> take a look at a second had micro/tiny SFF
[22:25:52] <Activ8> they awesome
[22:26:36] <Activ8> if you stick a 1TB SSD in you can get away with running proxmox or esxi with about 4-6 virtual machines

[22:27:40] <PublicWiFi> I like to keep mine off of C for one thing
[22:27:52] <PublicWiFi> but maybe im silly
[22:28:06] <Activ8> Nah don’t run it on a shuttle get ya self a micro box
[22:28:30] <sd> 14<N​oob> In production I would use separate storage for host and VMs, but this is a test environment so cheaper to run on same storage and rely on backups
[22:28:30] <PublicWiFi> y tho
[22:28:34] <Activ8> or if you are going to run it on a shuttle make sure the motherboard can handle 64/128gb ram to really up the spec
[22:28:42] <PublicWiFi> @Noob ohhh testing sorry I gotcha
[22:28:46] <Activ8> Why They are silent.
[22:29:14] <PublicWiFi> I'd like to find somethign with a newish processor
[22:29:15] <sd> 14<N​oob> should have clarified, but coming from ESXI I got a lot to learn what is the "norm" for production and test setups

[22:29:46] <Activ8> that tells you how power friendly it is
[22:29:57] <Activ8> costs peanuts to power per year
[22:30:21] <Activ8> These Lenovos takes a Xeon processor as well

[22:33:59] <PublicWiFi> I could use a USB3 NIC but thats sad
[22:34:06] <Activ8> No but you can add a usb nic if you wanted

[22:36:10] <Activ8> you don’t need a cert to be comfortable

[22:36:47] <PublicWiFi> my current setup has 3 ports actually
[22:36:50] <Activ8> there’s only so much you can learn about tech.  It’s more the terminology that’s good to know what it does and what the tech is for etc

[22:37:20] <SantaWasTaken> Amazon... why you suck so bad
[22:37:20] <Activ8> do you really need 3 though unless you segmenting your network off 
[22:37:39] <PublicWiFi> my current setup is LAN, WAN, and DMZ
[22:37:45] <Activ8> We have to remember all these cloud based services are massive
[22:37:47] <PublicWiFi> and then I have a VLAN DMZ too
[22:38:00] <Activ8> oh hell nah I don’t entertain DMZ
[22:38:02] <PublicWiFi> xD
[22:38:21] <PublicWiFi> I do for shit I dont want touching my network, my my firestick or anything IoT-like
[22:38:22] <Activ8> everything's behind my firewall and then it’s proxies off via caddy proxy
[22:38:44] <sd> 14<N​oob> oh ya terminology is tough. the combination of tech and industry acronyms is absolutely absurd. I can speak entirely in acronyms now that i've had friends ask me to speak English.

[22:39:40] <SantaWasTaken> ive got a vmz vlan just for work laptops
[22:39:44] <Activ8> One of the problems I find in tech is voip that’s a minefield with words and technology.  That’s a minefield.  My head can’t cope with voip sometimes but I try

[22:40:50] <PublicWiFi> IS AZURE DOWN? ANYONE KNOW?
[22:41:01] <Activ8> PublicWiFi all my services sits behind port 80.  It depends on which URL is hit.  It’s then proxied off to my services 
[22:41:08] <Activ8> do you use a proxy manager?
[22:41:09] <PublicWiFi> that's smert
[22:41:15] <PublicWiFi> i have nginx reverse proxy setup

[22:41:33] <PublicWiFi> its cake 
[22:41:41] <PublicWiFi> wouldn't take you an hour to get it working from scratch
[22:41:49] <Activ8> I found caddy a little easier I chose that over nginx in my test setups as a preference
[22:42:30] <PublicWiFi> dell optiplex micro 7050 goign for 200 bucks on ebay
[22:42:31] <Activ8> I did have nginx proxy manager with a gui but come away from it and went back to command based caddy file
