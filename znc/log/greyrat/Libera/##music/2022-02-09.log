[03:29:37] <artao> however, my blood pressure was 120 / 80-something. so that's good
[03:30:45] <LibertyDillo> artao> i weight 247 lbs tho. not good :( << On the plus side, you could always take up sumo wrestling
[03:30:49] <artao> Oreo torte is a perfectly valid breakfast. Shut up. 😛

[03:32:44] <artao> hey!! me too re: 275
[03:32:50] * Panther smiles
[03:32:59] <artao> at one point last year i was under 235
[03:33:12] <artao> getting down to the 220s would be nice
[03:33:13] <Panther> My dad was 300, but he was 6'6
[03:33:39] * Panther is 163.4 today.
[03:35:30] <LibertyDillo> nice
[03:35:36] <morf> happy bday
[03:35:45] <artao> Panther 163? :O
[03:35:49] <artao> that's a HUGE weight loss
[03:35:50] <artao> :P
[03:35:54] <Panther> I lost a little muscle getting down, but that is easy enough to build.
[03:36:09] <artao> dangerous weight loss. you should see a doctor. that's almost 100 lbs
[03:36:09] <Panther> Yep, I have a 32" waist instead of 52: :)
[03:36:26] <morf> :]
[03:36:31] <LibertyDillo> yipes
[03:36:37] <artao> wait ... you're not joking? that wasn't a typo of "263"?
[03:36:40] <Panther> It was over the course of 4 years.
[03:36:41] <artao> wow
[03:36:46] <artao> well congrats then!! :O

[03:36:50] <morf> i have to work more on the weightloss myself when things gets little less crazy
[03:37:02] <artao> "getting down to my high school weight" would still be 200-210 or so
[03:37:08] <artao> 200ish

[03:38:22] <artao> just big
[03:38:31] <Panther> I was pretty ripped a while ago at 200... I don't know if I can do that again. :-/ That was like 25 years ago.

[03:39:11] <artao> i sucked (and still suck) at pushups and pullups tho. especially pullups
[03:39:46] <Panther> I have 2 machines for pull ups.
[03:39:59] <artao> machines? o.O
[03:40:25] <Panther> A power tower and a squatting cage.. they both have multi-grip pull up handles on them.
[03:40:36] <artao> ah

[03:40:50] <artao> "machine"
[03:40:51] <artao> heh
[03:41:03] <Panther> I needed one with a neutral grip, cuz my right shoulder was bothering me, and the other grips hurt.
[03:41:15] <Panther> It's fine now, tho.
[03:41:54] <Panther> I have a pulley machine that is more mechanized, but it still doesn't have a motor. :)

[13:58:17] <Rashad> Would have to agree with that. 
[14:01:48] <rindolf> Rashad: powerpoint is nice too
[14:06:49] <Rashad> Damn it this is driving me crazy...
[14:08:01] <Rashad> I want to calculate averages of time periods. For example, a time period can be 2 hours, 100 days, or 3 months. 
[14:08:38] <Rashad> Now excel will do that in a pivot table with no problem, however excel doesn't exactly understand a "time period". 
[14:08:53] <rindolf> Rashad: VBA?
[14:09:05] <Rashad> It basically represents it as a datetime starting from 1900 Jan 1st at midnight.
[14:09:24] <Rashad> So a "time period" of 2 hours is the date 1900 Jan 1st 2 AM.
[14:10:15] <Rashad> And this will also be the number: 0.0833333
[14:10:24] <Rashad> 08333 = 2/24
[14:10:31] <rindolf> Rashad: why not use VBA?
[14:10:35] <Rashad> if the period was one day, it will be 1
[14:10:58] <Rashad> rindolf High maintenance 
[14:11:22] <Rashad> rindolf Using a pivot table means I can filter and group instantly. 
[14:12:02] <rindolf> Rashad: ok
[14:12:05] <Rashad> Anyway I just format the numbers like this: (d) hh:mm which excel is nice enough to understand. 
[14:12:19] <Rashad> That gives me averages for time periods like: (2) 12:34
[14:12:32] <Rashad> The problem now is if the period exceeds one month...
[14:12:45] <Rashad> I can print the month too using the format (m) (d) hh:mm
[14:12:48] <Rashad> BUT
[14:12:54] <Rashad> And here is the problem...
[14:13:04] <Rashad> the month will always start with 1, not 0 :|
[14:13:15] <Rashad> Since the month is already January, 1900
[14:14:10] <Rashad> So I thought I would do this trick: repeat the average column twice, once formatting as: "hh:mm", then format the other as a number with no decimals
[14:14:43] <Rashad> Since the integer part in these datenumbers is the number of days since 1900
[14:14:49] <Rashad> However...
[14:15:02] <Rashad> When I choose to show no decimals, excels will round the number :|
[14:15:15] <Rashad> This means that if the period is 0.983, I will get a full day. 
[14:15:22] <Rashad> I almost beat it man, almost beat it.
[14:15:45] <Rashad> And it seems there is no way to format a number showing only the integer part and without rounding.

[14:38:36] <Rashad> Tried to show all decimals, which would prevent any rounding, then trying to narrow the column so there is no room to display the decimals...
[14:38:52] <Rashad> Excel responded with rounding the number to make it fit the smaller column size :D
[14:40:23] <macrobat> Rashad: export to csv file write a program to process your data, reimport in excel? :D
[14:40:41] <Rashad> macrobat The thing is that I am trying to do all of this in a pivot table. 
[14:41:07] <Rashad> macrobat I use pivot tables because they are so useful when the raw data changes, or if you want to change the aggregate functions on the raw data. 
[14:41:42] <macrobat> am not good with excel, I haven't reached noob level 
[14:42:12] <Rashad> macrobat I can do these things manually but it would take at least 10 times the time. 
[14:42:25] <Rashad> This is why I am trying to do it as much as possible without writing any formulas. 
[14:43:07] <Rashad> However I can add a new column in the raw data that is a formula based on other columns, and that would be easy.
[14:43:55] <Rashad> However would still like to do aggregate calculations (averages/sums/etc over multiple rows) using the pivot table.
[14:45:23] <Rashad> Suppose your raw data is two columns with each row saying user X belongs to channel A
[14:45:52] <Rashad> So you will have Rashad ##music, but also Rashad #linux and macrobat ##music
[14:46:12] <Rashad> Then suppose you want to count how many users are there in every channel.
[14:46:28] <Rashad> Using a pivot table you write no formula but instead use your mouse to do that.

[21:07:58] <murthy> why its called metal?
[21:08:25] <nativetexan> cuz...it is
[21:08:37] <nativetexan> like jazz is jazz
[21:09:18] <Panther> Unlike the English verb '"want", it does not have a strong connotation of 'need', Similarly, the Russian verb for "give"(да́ть) is totally OK for polite requests. Just use it with «пожа́луйста».
[21:09:20] <Panther> :)
[21:09:22] <murthy> nativetexan: I think those words have root in latin and has some meaning I think
[21:09:34] <murthy> metal must mean something
[21:09:41] <murthy> may be the sound range or something
[21:10:02] <murthy> like we say about guitars, acoustic

[22:17:01] <artao> i did have to hold my head and neck and jaw a bit weird yesterday while the doctor was cutting stuff off of my back
[22:17:09] <artao> that's most li8kely why the jaw hurts
[22:17:17] <artao> BOC?
[22:17:21] <artao> bastards of color?

[22:17:46] <artao> 1) a very dangly mole/skin tag that i've had forever
[22:18:22] <artao> 2) This growth on my back that i first noticed about 4 or 5 weeks ago. It's being sent in for a biopsy. She thinks it's most likely benign tho.
[22:19:47] <artao> I'm afeared that my prostate cancer metastacized into skin cancer. Which would mean I urgently need to go in for a full-body scan. Cuz when prostate cancer metastacizes, it doesn't just do it in one place.
[22:20:27] <nativetexan> dang
[22:20:36] <louipc> wouldnt it become butt cancer
[22:21:48] * Panther sighs
[22:22:35] <artao> why would it become butt cancer? the prostate and butt are unrelated. they just share locality
[22:22:36] <artao> :P

[22:30:27] <nativetexan> enjoyed the show Panther
[22:30:40] <Panther> Thanks for listening. :)

[22:33:16] <artao> How crazy would it be if a phone actually did ring so much it came off the phone hook (which no longer exists, so the younger folk might not even know what that is/means)
[22:34:07] <inhahe_> I guess if you made a custom ringer that was loud enough to hear from a block away =P
[22:34:36] <artao> it'd need to vibrate insanely moreso than be loud
[22:36:53] <louipc> off the hook is oldschool
