[01:16:46] <melezhik> I am building Rakudo from source code on alpine OS / Azure docker container instance and wonder why it takes 10 minutes for 3 CPU / 7 GB docker container?
[01:16:47] <melezhik> https://gist.github.com/melezhik/e2ebd45f30e6ab4a0ca7486af08b80c7#file-gistfile1-txt-L74-L859
[01:17:54] <melezhik> could it be that building Rakudo could be slower when one builds on certain environment, like docker instance instead of VM or alpine os related ?
[01:18:04] <melezhik> the configuration is seen via the link

[01:29:10] <japhb> melezhik: Huh.  I can see that it is building on x86_64, but that parsing performance looks like no JIT (how it would perform on an ARM, for instance).  Maybe the node had memory bandwidth contention?
[01:31:01] <melezhik> sorry for dummy question, what is memory bandwidth contention? so do you mean it might require more memory? or this is docker specific thing?
[01:32:11] <MasterDuke> you could probably speed up your moarvm build (but not nqp or rakudo) by manually calling `make install` instead of using `--make-install`, since then you could add something like `-j6` to parallelize it
[01:34:23] <melezhik> MasterDuke I suppose I use `make install` ? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml ?
[01:34:45] <melezhik> https://github.com/melezhik/fastspec/blob/7c3fde1c79fec45bb2aa410be18d3a92bea6a926/sparky/fastspec/sparrowfile#L21
[01:34:53] <melezhik> sorry, the second link. is correct
[01:35:40] <MasterDuke> but that's rakudo's `make install`, not moarvm's
[01:36:53] <MasterDuke> btw, you could also speed up the moarvm build by using `--has-libtommath` and `--has-libuv` (assuming there are in fact os packages for them installed)
[01:38:09] <MasterDuke> i guess you could try putting something like `MAKEFLAGS=-j6` in the environment, maybe the moarvm build will pick that up
[01:38:10] <melezhik> MasterDuke what should be the command to build moar? I am not sure if I understand, I just follow Rakudo installation instruction

[11:11:13] <CIAvash> What is the solution to MAIN sub accepting both `Bool` and `Int` when you have `sub MAIN (Int :$number)`? because Bool is Int. So it will only accept `--number` and `--number=1`, not `--number 1`, I can make a lone `--number` not work with a subset, but I can't get `--number 1` to work.
[11:17:03] <moon-child> I don't think it's possible, happy to be proven wrong though
[11:35:18] <CIAvash> OK, found a solution! `subset Number of Str where .Int.so`
[11:36:25] <moon-child> what happens if you pass 0?
[11:40:03] <CIAvash> good question, 0 doesn't work but in this case I need positive numbers
[11:45:53] <CIAvash> can make it work with zero with `subset Number of Str where !.defined || ($_ ne "" && .Int)`

[19:06:13] <bisectable6> [Coke], Bisecting by output (old=2018.09 new=2018.10) because on both starting points the exit code is 2
[19:06:30] <[Coke]> .. that is a lot more output than I was expecting, apologies.

[19:24:13] <CIAvash> That's weird, the bisect seems to confirm what ugexe said
[19:24:47] <[Coke]> wasn't trying to correct you, just curious myself.

[22:39:21] <toddr> I'm a rare poster here but wanted to share that the Perl and Raku Conference in Houston is coming up June 21-25. If anyone here can share with a wider Raku community, that would be appreciated. https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tprc-houston-newsletter-2 There is also a link off the newsletter to join the mailing list if you prefer
[22:57:11] <moritz> I tweeted about it with @raku_news
[22:57:35] <toddr> thank you moritz !
[22:59:38] <[Coke]> How do registration numbers look so far, toddr ?
[23:00:06] <[Coke]> I know we had some users who were very excited about an in person conference.
[23:05:22] *** Parts: cstls (~ruiner@2603-7081-0800-4824-916b-9ea4-fecd-8dae.res6.spectrum.com) (out)
[23:24:19] <toddr> actual registration is very light but that's normal this far out.
