[00:00:54] <foo> Wooble: thank you! pytype added to list
[00:00:58] <ssbr> it's interface boundaries which are the most useful. (Indeed, many statically typed languages these days just let you infer the type)

[00:08:39] <SnoopJ> fofoni, my complaints go beyond just the implications for UX, but the "our bindings tooling doesn't do `auto`" angle is one that largely becomes "ah, we don't care" whenever I broach it.
[00:08:57] <ssbr> nedbat: the static type of a thing is pasted into generic code, instead of erased from generic code -- so for example, given a generic T, you can ask for the `T::foo` static method, which you can't do in Java or Python.
[00:09:03] <SnoopJ> Worse yet: there are bindings tools that *do* understand it, and I've been told "absolutely not" when asking if we could gradually switch to those :(

[06:09:11] <damonlynch> In setup.py, is there a drop-in replacement from setuptools to replace a very basic use of distutils build? By basic I mean the sub command is simply ('build_man_page', None), ('build_icons', None), ('build_translations', None)
[06:09:48] <damonlynch> I want to purge the use of distutils. I'm struggling a little to find docs to help ease the transition from a 2016 era setup.py that has this one distutils remanent.

[10:41:29] <jaggz> Repiphany, I'd prefer to update everything as late as possible.  I manually got most of it running with 3.9 and fixing some modules.. was quite a pain, and then another one of his scripts was failing from some other conflict between modules..
[10:41:33] <jaggz> frustrating
[10:41:50] <jaggz> actually, I still have a warning right now
[10:42:51] <jaggz> Repiphany, the project is actually pretty cool.. if you're interested in trying it, you'd need to download his .zip of his trained voice model, and I can give you my reqs.txt that works enough to run his engine.py in py39
[10:43:08] <Repiphany> I mean the point of requirements.txt is to have a snapshot of packages that work correctly (with the right python version)
[10:43:32] <Repiphany> You'd have to do the maintaining if you want to upgrade the project to use newer package versions
[10:43:53] <jaggz> he's dropped the project anyway, so it's not changing now

[14:22:02] <bjs> e.g. if you want to make your package installed 'globally' for your user's python3.7 installation for example, then you can `python3.7 -m pip install --user --editable .`    but if you're unfamiliar with virtualenvs I would definitely take a look at them as they make managing Python packages a little easier to clean up later

[14:26:11] <bjs> azi`: so `pip` is the tool that actually installs packages so that you can `import foo` to see them. It can install from pypi (e.g. `pip install numpy`) but it can also install from a local directory `pip install .`, and you can ask it to install those with symlinks rather than a copy with `pip install --editable .` which means the `import foo` actually uses the files in your directory.
[14:27:19] <azi`> amazing, now I see what --editable does. thank you bjs
[14:27:24] <bjs> azi`: when pip installs it, it needs to know some metadata about your package: what modules/packages to install, and possibly what dependencies they have if any.  Pretty much all the other metadata on that page you probably don't need unless you want to give it to different people

[17:56:01] <azi`> bjs I've went through the doc you sent and created tailored the instructions for my project module. now when I run pip3 install --user --editable . I get the following error https://bpa.st/TFCA
[17:56:26] <azi`> in essence it says [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages' which I don't understand since everything is done locally
[17:57:17] <azi`> any idea why this would happen
[17:57:21] <bahamas> azi`: sounds like you're running the system pip
[17:57:28] <bahamas> which requires sudo
[17:57:48] <bahamas> azi`: if you're trying to use a virtual env, maybe you forgot to activate it
[17:58:06] <azi`> bahamas: i am not using virtualenv
[17:58:24] <azi`> bahamas: what should I be using instead of system pip?
[17:58:40] <jinsun> make a venv, and use the venv pip
[17:58:54] <bahamas> azi`: people usually use a virtualenv, so they isolate their dependencies from the system ones

[17:59:30] <jinsun> if you are using pip, you should not avoid using venvs
[17:59:42] <jinsun> either use both or use neither
[17:59:55] <azi`> hmm

[18:02:51] <jinsun> azi`: running pip as root is asking for trouble though, high chance of running into permission problems and pip might overwrite files that your os package manager was managing

[18:06:28] <deniska> azi`: python looks for installed packages in a few dirs, some of them are relative to directory python is installed into. `venv` makes a copy (a symlink on systems supporting it) of your python installation so that it's kinda like a separate python installation to install pip packages into
[18:06:41] <bjs> azi`: probably you have multiple versions of Python installed and you installed for the wrong one

[18:09:59] <bjs> azi`: make a venv like `python3.7 -m venv path/to/venv` then you can use `path/to/venv/bin/pip` instead of just `pip`
[18:10:11] <azi`> also I need it to be editable so that I can make changes to the module without having to re-install all the time

[18:11:49] <azi`> use case: use my own module (i.e be able to import it, make changes, re-import it etc)
[18:12:13] <bjs> and what you install only goes into that directory, and only that dirs python will see it.

[18:51:36] <EtherMan> SnoopJ: The error comes from the init.d script, not python specifically. It's just a standard pid file from init.d, just as the script is just a pretty bog standard init.d script that sends SIGHUP to the pid.   A very basic example of code that produces the error, is simply import os, followed by os.system("/etc/init.d/softcam reload"). But I suspect that doesn't say much without the softcam script right?

[20:06:58] <TML> it's used for things other than encoding, too
[20:07:01] <Wooble> wither PEP 8 or 257 also used to require a blank line at the end of docstrings because of someone's emacs.
[20:07:07] <Wooble> either*
[20:07:10] <InPhase> I can imagine a text editor doing this, because text editors don't get to define languages.  But languages should not change behavior from comments.
[20:07:22] <SnoopJ> but apparently it's not, it's just looking for some comment with "coding" and some other stuff in it
[20:07:26] <grym> you can set file-local variables that way too

[20:07:42] <grym> (but maybe don't)
[20:07:47] <SnoopJ> I had the mistaken impression because I've seen the emacs spelling most often, though, so I guess that's roughly the same effect :)

[20:29:27] <Batzy> well i just dont know what the "best" "most correct" way to go about this is
[20:29:36] <SnoopJ> Batzy, if you're writing something from scratch, it sometimes just makes more sense to write Cython code
[20:29:53] <Batzy> i need to define some classes, in my case big ints and matrices with entries of those ints. And I need some operations like multiplication etc

[20:30:12] <Batzy> what's up with that
[20:30:13] <InPhase> Batzy: Cython seems to fill a weird niche, pretending to by Python but where you have to write Python that looks like C code just to get the C level performance.  It's often just better to write a C++ library or something and setup to call it from Python via one of the many interfaces.

[20:31:53] <SnoopJ> for simple stuff the choice is I think largely an aesthetic one, but for complicated things, it may be better to use it as an interface layer (or maybe 'just' CFFI)

[20:32:16] <SnoopJ> Batzy, right, those are the parts that make it a superset. You need type declarations to do the things it wants to do

[22:01:37] <SnoopJ> Batzy, one of them is something you can write in a Python program (i.e. using only Python syntax), the other one is something you write in a Cython program (i.e. Cython syntax)
[22:01:53] <Batzy> i have no idea what to do

[22:02:24] <Batzy> im just trying to define a class with an attribute that's an unsigned 64 bit integer
[22:02:28] <Batzy> and already i am completely lost
[22:02:35] <SnoopJ> Keep reading the tutorial, probably, if you still want to use Cython. You might also look at CFFI though if you are finding all this learning hard, it requires a little less understanding of the "there are now three languages" part.
[22:02:40] <Batzy> i got something compiled, and i can import it

[23:50:43] <bjs> a "list of characters" is really just a list of strings, and a method to turn it into one string basically has to do string catenation which is more work than just "dump this into that"
[23:51:04] <pikajude> hi, i'd like to write a type annotation for my function that takes the same kwargs as subprocess.run (it's just a convenience wrapper around that method)
[23:51:06] <SnoopJ> yea, the tuple has a lot less work to do
[23:51:16] <pikajude> but i don't want to copy all of the kwarg definitions from subprocess.run just for my method
[23:51:32] <pikajude> is there a generic i can use that resolves to "the type of the keyword args accepted by such and such function"?
[23:51:53] <jinsun> jazzy: .insert(100, 1) is equivalent to [100:100] = 1,slicing allows indices outside the range because ... I don't know
[23:52:01] <SnoopJ> tuple spelling seems roughly linear, string concat seems a bit worse, probably because of all that concatenation (allocation probably matters a fair deal?)
