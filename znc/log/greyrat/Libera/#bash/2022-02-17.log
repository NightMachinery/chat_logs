[01:53:38] <tirnanog> seems perfectly normal. you supplied an argument that is an empty string. my_cmd is complaining about it.

[12:51:29] <cadmio> Hello
[12:52:16] <cadmio> after starting the daemon "dbus-daemon --session --print-address" I need to take the address and do "export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-kL9BsSO4Xs,guid=90d0a2df58f58b1b97d31ad9620d1b24"
[12:52:55] <cadmio> so the part "unix:abstract..." is the address printed when launching the daemon
[12:54:01] <grawity> you could get that with $(...) and --fork, but generally you're not supposed to start dbus-daemon like that in the first place

[19:09:21] <p3rL> with envorenment i can easily change the 3rd variable without filling all other defaults
[19:10:26] <Soliton> in the environment you specify a specific variable with arguments you specify a specific option.
[19:10:28] <emanuele6> ok, so environment variables are used as default values if the argument is not passed.
[19:11:02] <Pinchiukas> Soliton: I need the exact names of directories without any preceding or trailing slashes. Wonder if I can pass stuff as stdin into 'jq' from 'ls' and then somehow put them into an array. That seems a bit more reliable than glob expansion.

[19:11:08] <Soliton> as with options you have a default value. there is no practical difference.

[20:00:35] <frojnd> Is it safe to store exit status in variable? e.g. EXIT_STATUS=$(git diff --exit-code foo.json)
[20:00:47] <Soliton> that is not what that does.
[20:00:49] <Soliton> !$(

[20:00:52] <emanuele6> !$?

[22:03:09] <SkyLeach> I'm a little embarassed but I still can't quite figure out how to use -prune with find from GNU findutils and if anyone has a moment to clear it up I would be forever grateful
[22:03:16] <SkyLeach> the simple problem: if I put `-path "*/.git" -prune` before something like -exec I get absolutely nothing unless I use -o and then it seems -prune is ignored entirely.  the exec is easy enough: `echo grep '{}' \+`

[22:06:37] <Soliton> or what greycat said.

[22:10:39] <greycat> the only "shell" piece of this is the quoting
[22:10:39] <Soliton> no.
[22:11:03] <SkyLeach> well that's good to know, so find actually parses the parenthesis?

[22:11:33] <SkyLeach> Oh, well cool learned something useful today.  Thank you.

[22:12:51] <SkyLeach> what does the ! do?
[22:12:56] <Soliton> not
[22:13:07] <greycat> negates the "result" of the next thing
[22:13:25] <SkyLeach> but that isn't ! (not) (-prune)?  Syntactically seems like a double-negative?
[22:13:31] <Soliton> (-prune is always true.)
[22:13:46] <SkyLeach> oh... interesting
