[00:26:57] <gwozniak> Downloading a new version of the company's IDE and installing in my Windows VM just so I can take a screenshot of how to do a Makefile properly
[00:27:04] <gwozniak> How is your day?
[00:28:25] <indigo> Decent. My team's having an offsite on Friday so I am looking forward to it :)
[00:28:40] <gwozniak> oh nice
[00:28:59] <gwozniak> Our local Toronto team should probably get together soon
[00:30:18] <bkero> offsites? Wow
[00:30:23] <bkero> I haven't met my team since 2019
[00:30:57] <indigo> My team is very different; we've had a lot of people leave/join since 2019
[00:32:09] <imode> bkero: me either.
[00:36:15] <skyl4rk> first half-day worked in the office in more than a year...? more than more than a year? it's weird
[00:38:30] <dminkovsky> your company has its own IDE gwozniak ?
[00:38:36] <dminkovsky> or you mean the one it uses?
[00:41:58] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: we make an IDE for embedded development on the company's devices
[00:59:42] <dminkovsky> cool
[00:59:48] <dminkovsky> is it called, eclipse
[00:59:59] <dminkovsky> 😭
[01:00:12] <gwozniak> No, but it's based on Netbeans :)

[01:00:56] <dminkovsky> nice!!
[01:01:21] <dminkovsky> my brother in law was using netbeans as his daily driver for java dev as of at least 2 years ago
[01:01:31] <dminkovsky> it looked pretty nice
[01:01:51] <gwozniak> As a code editor, I don't care for it.  But as a debugger, it's invaluable.
[01:05:14] <imode> I don't know what company I want to work for..

[01:28:54] <dminkovsky> what's good about the debugger?
[01:29:48] <gwozniak> Memory views, mainly
[01:30:25] <gwozniak> The ability to visually inspect all the special registers is super useful
[01:34:08] <dminkovsky> interesting
[01:34:19] <dminkovsky> netbeans does more than java?
[01:34:47] <indigo> Time to rewrite it in TypeScript
[01:35:00] <indigo> VSCode is all the rage these days, gotta keep up with the treadmill of innovation
[01:35:07] <dminkovsky> lol
[01:35:14] <dminkovsky> vscode is so freaking overhyped
[01:35:17] <dminkovsky> i mean, i use it, it's fine
[01:35:23] <dminkovsky> but ppl talk about it like it's the most amazing thing ever
[01:35:46] <bkero> Do not want electron text editor
[01:35:49] <dminkovsky> the glowing HN comments that just can't understand how an evil corp like MS could have made this amazing thing
[01:35:54] <riv> ive come around to it
[01:36:12] <riv> it's super badly nerfed on arch linux
[01:36:24] <riv> if you tried it on that youd think it was pretty rubbish
[01:36:29] <bkero> It's super badly nerfed if you use anything except the blessed builds from MS itself.
[01:36:34] <riv> yes
[01:36:36] <bkero> Plugins just don't work
[01:36:40] <bkero> They gatekeep that shit.
[01:37:00] <bkero> Or more specifically: you're not allowed to use the extension marketplace.
[01:37:04] <riv> im ethically and technologically opposed to all this stuff
[01:37:12] <riv> but i use it and it's pretty good lol
[01:37:36] <riv> its got some real annoyances too
[01:38:00] <riv> some ui stuff is good, the gdb integrating is very nice
[01:38:26] <riv> but others are really annoying and strange, like all this git crap inside the code - but if you turn it iff you also turn off some useful things
[01:40:03] <bkero> Sounds like polluting your filesystem, or in this case your source control
[01:40:12] <bkero> Just like .DS_Store files
[01:40:28] <dminkovsky> I made a kernet extension that puts DS_Store files in all my folders
[01:40:31] <bkero> Most IDEs are guilty of that
[01:40:58] <dminkovsky> vscode sucks
[01:41:02] <dminkovsky> but it's pretty nice
[01:41:16] <dminkovsky> it's not heavier or slower than webstorm
[01:41:24] <dminkovsky> and it's easier to make very useful than vim
[01:41:34] <dminkovsky> honestly what sucks is vim
[01:41:41] <dminkovsky> because it's really nice but to make it very useful you need to be a pro
[01:42:13] <dminkovsky> i got highly proficient in vim keying but never found the time afterwards to become very proficient at the environment/vim language, etc
[01:42:19] <dminkovsky> it's freaking sad
[01:42:26] <bkero> Reminds me of https://www.theolognion.com/unreal-engine-5-is-meant-to-ridicule-web-developers/
[01:42:26] <buttsbot> Unreal Engine 5 is meant to ridicule web developers
[01:42:27] <dminkovsky> so i use vscode
[01:42:43] <bkero> Turns out that the level of computational optimization and sheer power of this incredible technology is meant to make fun of web developers, who struggle to maintain 15fps while scrolling a single-page application on a $2000 MacBook Pro, while enjoying 800ms delays typing the corresponding code into their Electron-based text editors.
[01:43:00] <dminkovsky> i really don't know if that's true ^
[01:43:01] <bkero> You can tell this is dated, Macbook Pros are $3000 now.
[01:43:15] <dminkovsky> as much as MB price-creep is true and fucked up
[01:43:22] <dminkovsky> vscode is quite responsive
[01:43:31] <dminkovsky> it's opens and becomes responsive /really/ fast
[01:43:34] <dminkovsky> it*
[01:43:35] <bkero> Maybe anecdotally
[01:43:39] <bkero> but try measuring that
[01:43:47] <bkero> and compare it against something else
[01:43:49] <dminkovsky> my LIVED EXPERIENCE is all that matters bkero
[01:43:53] <dminkovsky> stop opressing me
[01:44:00] <dminkovsky> sigh

[01:46:12] <manicennui> vim is faster
[01:46:16] * manicennui sits back
[01:46:20] <dminkovsky> well yeah vim is faster than vscode duh
[01:46:27] <dminkovsky> but vscode isn't atom
[01:46:36] <dminkovsky> remember those posts about how atom can't open 1 MB text file
[01:47:14] <manicennui> You can fight over which shitty IDE is better. =P
[01:47:20] <dminkovsky> exactly
[01:47:33] <dminkovsky> i really want to know why i was called a narcissist that's pretty brutal

[01:47:44] <dminkovsky> oh
[01:47:49] <dminkovsky> lol that was a joke
[01:47:57] <bkero> I see
[01:47:59] <dminkovsky> born out of frustration
[01:48:08] <dminkovsky> was that not obviously a joke :(
[01:48:31] <bkero> I gave it an 80% chance of being sarcasm
[01:48:55] <dminkovsky> i'll take it!
[01:48:59] <dminkovsky> you don't know me, so that's fair
[01:49:14] <bkero> and text lacks empathy vOv
[01:49:53] <dminkovsky> bkero do you emacs?
[01:50:11] <bkero> Nope, just vim
[01:50:22] <bkero> I'm a SRE. If YAML needs a language server I'll eat my shoe.
[01:52:36] <dminkovsky> yeah i love vim, except for my aforementioned sadness about it
[01:52:55] <dminkovsky> if i ever catch a break i'll check out neovim
[01:53:19] <dminkovsky> bkero: what's your take on YAML
[01:53:21] <dminkovsky> another hot-button issue
[01:53:33] <bkero> It allows comments, therefore it has at least a B- grade.
[01:54:14] <bkero> Also it's meant to be read by humans. So at least a B. The ambiguity of a list of newline-separated dicts frustrates me.
[01:54:36] <bkero> I wish that some of the more advanced features were standard in yaml parsers, such as anchors.
[01:54:59] <bkero> and I wished either yq sucked less
[02:02:54] <dminkovsky> what are anchors
[02:02:59] <dminkovsky> i'm not familiar w/ those in yaml
[02:03:06] <bkero> &
[02:03:15] <bkero> They basically allow you to define a block somewhere, then reference it somewhere else
[02:03:30] <dminkovsky> neat never heard of that
[02:03:50] <dminkovsky> some like they should be considered harmful if you know what i'm saying
[02:03:50] <buttsbot> Your FACE is considered harmful!
[02:03:53] <dminkovsky> woah
[02:03:54] <dminkovsky> awesome.
[02:04:08] <dminkovsky> s/some like/sounds like/
[02:06:53] <bkero> I agree. Using the full complexity of the tool is usually a bad thing.

[17:18:04] <Brekkjern> That sounds exceedingly stupid
[17:18:14] <dminkovsky> yeah it was very intense
[17:18:37] <Brekkjern> I mean, it's decent advice if the advice is "Try to find synonyms, because it can be very repetitive"
[17:18:38] <dminkovsky> strangely enough she was alright otherwise. pretty chill too
[17:19:07] <dminkovsky> sigh
[17:19:08] <Brekkjern> Like, why use "very hungry" when you can use "famished"
[17:19:11] <dminkovsky> friday how's everyone doing
[17:19:15] <dminkovsky> lol Brekkjern
[17:19:22] <dminkovsky> "i'm just FAMISHED"
[17:19:25] <Brekkjern> I'm done with homework, so I'm kicking back and relaxing
[17:19:30] <dminkovsky> nice
[17:20:49] <dminkovsky> being done with homework is impressive. i don't think i ever reached that state at any time during my school career, gradeschool, highschool, college
[17:21:20] <Brekkjern> The deadline is in 9 hours or so
[17:21:34] <Brekkjern> I bet I could polish it up a bit more, but there's really no point
[17:21:47] <dminkovsky> impressive.
[17:21:53] <Brekkjern> Now there's just an exam in a couple weeks, and another exam a week or so after that.
[17:22:07] <Brekkjern> So I should start studying for that really
[17:22:36] <riv> today i learned more new things about floats
[17:23:06] <dminkovsky> you need to clear them?
[17:23:13] <dminkovsky> or you mean ice cream floats?

[17:28:37] <riv> when im using windows, every single day I have to reconfigure my keyboard
[17:40:01] <dminkovsky> is that related to floats?
[17:42:28] <riv> lol
[17:49:53] <dminkovsky> you lawlin riv
[17:50:10] <dminkovsky> sometimes you gotta lawl
[17:50:55] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: sounds like that teacher was either trying to do the "make people talk like good writing" or was just sick of hearing their students say "very" :)
[17:52:02] <gwozniak> I got added to a chat at work for another team to help out with Makefiles.  Now it's morphed into help with Git and their build
[17:52:18] <gwozniak> Trying to store the Git version in Git.  Not gonna work, I'm afraid
[17:52:55] <gwozniak> It's clear these teams are not software teams...
[17:53:31] <dminkovsky> i mean, you probably write a script to write the version of git into a commit?
[17:53:53] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: yeah something like that. but she was pretty strangely absolutist about it
[17:54:39] <dminkovsky> i received this gem of a communication this morning https://i.imgur.com/FDwTYRP.png
[17:54:44] <gwozniak> I *think* what is happening with this build thing is that they are getting the version info from git, putting it in a file, then commiting that file.  Which then changess the version
[17:55:35] <dminkovsky> right
[17:55:43] <dminkovsky> that's inherent to that situation
[17:55:49] <dminkovsky> if by version you mean HEAD commit
[17:56:24] <gwozniak> Yeah, I have to determine if that is, in fact, what they are doing
[17:57:07] <Brekkjern> Or they are java devs and are used to just cramming everything they use into the repo :P
[17:57:07] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[17:57:26] <dminkovsky> "vendoring
[17:57:44] <gwozniak> This person didn't know how to write a Make rule to put the version information in a file.  I showed them that, and now they say it's causing a rebuild every time because the version keeps changing

[20:02:48] <dminkovsky> glad i put nginx in front of this
[20:27:31] <epilys> dminkovsky, does it have ads? if it's not monetized consider open sourcing?
[20:36:53] <dminkovsky> epilys: it doesn't have ads yet, but i hope to introduce advertising soon assuming there is a userbase that would sustain it. the advertising wouldn't be like FB/twitter/instagram though; it would be in line with the core concept of "periodicity" so i am thinking something like how in the US we used to have these things called "circulars" that came every week with the Sunday morning paper
[20:37:13] <dminkovsky> like, i love the Newegg emailer, but it comes 5 times a day and it's just too much
[20:37:28] <cot> 5 times a day??
[20:37:29] <dminkovsky> but as i kid i looked forward to the weekly Best Buy/Circuit City ads
[20:37:37] <dminkovsky> and would look at them carefully every page
[20:37:41] <dminkovsky> so i want to do something like that
[20:37:46] <dminkovsky> cot: i'm not exaggerating very much
[20:37:51] <dminkovsky> at least 2-3 if not 4
[20:37:56] <dminkovsky> maybe 5 i don't know
[20:38:55] <dminkovsky> epilys: and a few other revenue ideas
[20:39:24] <dminkovsky> i definitely hope it works out as a commercial product :/
[20:39:27] <epilys> so not targeted advertising then? cool
[20:39:34] <dminkovsky> yeah no self-targeted
[20:39:43] <dminkovsky> you go and pick the circulars you want
[20:40:01] <epilys> to be honest I doubt people will care about that
[20:40:16] <epilys> ads is just something you dump in front of the user's eye and hope they catch some memory of it
[20:41:21] <epilys> the periodicity sounds cool though

[21:25:49] <gerikson> what's nice about Perl is you can add FP where it makes sense as you go
