[03:54:53] <thomasjm[m]> is there some way to get HLS to typecheck all files in a project from within an IDE? i know i can run `haskell-language-server typecheck` in the terminal, but I'd like to browse through all the warnings and stuff and auto-fix them from within Emacs/VSCode
[03:57:06] <thomasjm[m]> (maybe this is a question about Emacs specifically, VSCode seems to automatically start indexing everything)

[05:25:58] <sooch_> Is this what you are looking for? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/8ziEysPp/warnings.png
[05:43:50] <thomasjm[m]> right @sooch_, i'd like to see all of the warnings for my project. on second though it doesn't work in VSCode automatically either, since it seems to only index files that are open (or imported by a file that's open? not sure)

[09:34:39] <jneira[m]> hi, afaik the unique way for now is opening all the files you know are not working (calling hls as you are doing now or the build tool)
[09:35:29] <jneira[m]> there is a ticket asking for something similar iirc
