[02:17:25] <kuudes> quick call: it seems that indeed if one only focuses on serious illness, then indeed 2 doses is enough, but if one focuses on infection, 2 doses clearly is not enough but 3 doses clearly is needed
[02:17:31] <kuudes> also 3 doses in any case seem clearly very effective compared to 2 doses
[02:17:43] <kuudes> I guess if I steelman KRAR, they could be optimizing for the optimal booster schedule by lenghtening the duration between doses. but they should say if they are aiming for such
[02:17:48] <kuudes> also, indeed KRAR material seems to me clearly say that at with 3 doses the vaccine is effective enough to get us herd immunity without local infection spread but 2 doses clearly is not
[02:17:55] <kuudes> specifically working age population will get infections, as there the vaccine effectiveness against infections weakens the fastest

Some book name might as well be the name of a movie, e.g. Ready Player One [6]. Simply matching the names of the books would produce a whole lot of irrelevant results. This is where Deep Learning comes into play. Recent advances in

As a result, my app is able to present a

[06:35:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> My advice to anyone even contemplating nutmeg is NO NO NO. I mean the first day was pleasant, but I was expecting good visuals (which were pratically non-existant) and the rest of the week was just plain ruined for me. I think that if you wanna get high stick to things you know about. I'm not saying become a street junkie, but just stick to smoking the bowls.

[06:35:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Why can't that be right
[06:35:56] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: because I bought my tri-tips at aldi for like $4/lb, maybe $5/lb max. they're charging 400-500% more?
[06:36:52] <gwern> (and that's the largest option with the shipping most amortized, and it looks like since it's free-shipping you can't simply buy larger than that, so that's the best option $/lb...)
[06:37:45] <gwern> I was expecting a premium but on their most processed or premium products and on the basic raw meat cuts more like 50-100%. this premium is like 10x larger than I expected

[06:48:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ingested in small amounts as a spice, nutmeg produces no noticeable physiological or neurological response, but in large doses, both raw nutmeg freshly ground from kernels and nutmeg oil have psychoactive effects,[2][26][16] which appear to derive from anticholinergic-like hallucinogenic mechanisms attributed to myristicin and elemicin.[16][27]"
[06:49:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Varying considerably from person to person, nutmeg intoxication may occur with side effects, such as delirium, anxiety, confusion, headaches, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, eye irritation, and amnesia.[2][16] Intoxication takes several hours to reach maximum effect,[2] and effects may last for several days.[16][26] Rarely, nutmeg overdose causes death, especially if the nutmeg is combined with other drugs.[16] Incidents of
[06:49:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  fatal poisoning from nutmeg and myristicin individually are uncommon.[2]"
[06:49:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Nutmeg may interact with anxiolytic drugs, produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, and evoke acute episodes of psychosis.[2]"

[16:44:24] <kuudes> I have been to 23 covid tests so far because of my random infections

[21:26:01] <feep> almost EVERYBODY in the gis for how to ride an escooter is doing it wrong and will fly over the handlebars when they have to brake
[21:26:52] <feep> we need to make escooter boards thinner so people get the idea
[21:27:39] <feep> the core point is that you *need* to be able to *push onto* the handlebars if you suddenly have to brake
[21:27:59] <feep> if your pose is so that in a sudden brake, your body would *fold over* the handlebars, you are in the wrong pose :V
[21:28:12] <saturn2> is this just a flex by elon musk to prove he can make tesla owners humiliate themselves
[21:28:14] <ggreer> every vehicle I own... I practice braking pretty early on to get used to it
[21:28:47] <feep> ggreer: well I think the challenge is that you need to be driving and ... like, the first day or so of scooter, I think the scooter should 1. limit itself to 8km/h, 2. just randomly brake out of the blue sometimes
[21:28:54] <feep> just randomly do a hard brake
[21:29:11] <feep> that's the challenge
[21:29:33] <ggreer> saturn2: the FSD beta program has >2,000 users with literally zero crashes in the past year. they don't want to increase rollout and get the bad press right away (when a crash inevitably does happen)
[21:29:41] <feep> like, I believe people can brake a scooter if they can see it coming, the difficulty is instantly transitioning into braking when you have like ~600ms of warning
[21:29:52] <feep> and for that you need a sideways pose
[21:29:58] <feep> so that you just hipcheck the steering bar

[22:58:53] <ggreer> you could force people into certain roles. eg: if you choose the heavy in team fortress, your voice is always low pitched and gruff
[23:00:24] <feep> I've thought about scooter braking some more
[23:00:52] <feep> I think the thing to look out for is that someone *either* has their front foot set well forward, with body mass resting on the back foot, *or* has their front foot at an inwards angle to their pose
[23:00:58] <feep> ie. right foot bent left, left foot bent right
[23:01:12] <feep> both are safe
[23:01:36] <gwern> ggreer: definitely a lot of social gaming possibilties. people switching roles
[23:01:38] <feep> front foot set forward, body mass on back foot is best-case safe, because if you brake you end up with effectively a line from your com through your leg to the front wheel
[23:01:52] <feep> which is as good as braking gets
[23:02:37] <feep> but that pose is exhausting because your back leg ends up bent a bit
[23:03:07] <feep> "front foot at an inward angle" is almost as safe (imo), because when braking you will reflexively brace your hip against the steering column, which then forms that "straight line through the point of rotation"
[23:03:18] <feep> at a higher angle than your leg in the first case, but still pretty good
[23:03:49] <feep> the point is that the com probably stays under that line, which is why you aren't flipping over the handlebar
[23:04:27] <feep> now if you're standing *upright* on the scooter and you brake, first of all you cannot brace with your hip because that would require enthusiastically thrusting your body weight through your dick into the steering column
[23:04:37] <feep> a strategy that nature instinctively disinclines one towards
[23:04:54] <saturn2> bracing your hip against the steering column seems like a bad idea since your center of mass will be over the front wheel?
[23:05:09] <feep> saturn2: not sure if I have the right term, I mean, the thing that connects the handle bar to the front wheel?
[23:05:22] <saturn2> yeah
[23:05:35] <feep> yeah, ime it's second best because the steering column is usually bent a little backwards
[23:05:37] <saturn2> (i don't know what it's really called either)
[23:05:42] <ggreer> you have to lean back as far as you can or you'll endo. this is true for bicycles, motorcycles.... pretty much anything with a short wheelbase
[23:05:49] <feep> and you're bracing your hip, which is pretty big too
[23:05:57] <feep> so the actual line is "crotch through front wheel"
[23:06:50] <feep> anyway, there's a hidden benefit I'll get to in a bit
[23:06:59] <feep> ggreer: anyway, what's endo?
[23:07:04] <ggreer> end over end
[23:07:12] <feep> oh yes, exactly, I'll get to that
[23:07:21] <feep> because that is what happens if you stand upright lol
[23:07:33] <feep> immediately half your body weight goes onto your arms, which, being at a poor angle, probably fold
[23:07:57] <feep> so now your upper body goes forwards, tipping the entire scooter over
[23:08:05] <feep> which means you faceplant the ground with one meter of rotational radius
[23:08:11] <feep> (this kills the spine)
[23:09:10] <feep> anyway, that's the hidden advantage of braking by hip brace; even if you go over, you'll be rotating around your feet, which will be close to the ground
[23:09:27] <ggreer> motorcycle vehicle dynamics mostly apply. eg: never lose grip on the front wheel (lowside). losing grip on the rear wheel is fine as long as you keep it locked until you're stopped (or you'll highside)
[23:09:47] * feep does not know these terms~
[23:10:05] <ggreer> there must be an article about this stuff. let me try to dig one up
[23:10:27] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowsider
[23:10:28] <feep> anyway, I think even if you go flying you probably hit the ground hips first
[23:10:28] <Robomot> Lowsider - Wikipedia (The lowsider or lowside is a type of motorcycle or bicycle crash usually occurring in a turn. It is caused when either the front or rear wheel slides out as a result of either too much braking into the corner, too much acceleration through or out of the corner, or too much speed carried into or through the corner for the available grip.[ …)
[23:10:32] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highsider
[23:10:32] <Robomot> Highsider - Wikipedia (A highsider or highside is a type of motorcycle accident characterized by sudden and violent rotation of the bike around its long axis. This generally happens when the rear wheel loses traction, skids, and then suddenly regains traction, creating a large torque which flips the rider head first off the side of the motorcycle or over the handlebars. …)
[23:10:36] <feep> which sucks but is more survivable
[23:11:23] <feep> ggreer: yes! exactly
[23:12:01] <ggreer> in motorcycle training, you're taught that if you lock the rear wheel while braking, you keep it locked until you're stopped. if you let it rotate again, the body of the bike will become straight quickly, and it'll throw you off
[23:12:01] <feep> if I understand the forces right (I've never fallen yet), upright standing => highsider, sideways/hipcheck => ..... midsider, that mode isn't really possible for bicycles
[23:12:06] <feep> or motorbikes
[23:12:25] <feep> you have to imagine a bicycle with pedals in the front wheel
[23:12:46] <feep> hm
[23:12:50] <feep> no that's not quite it..
[23:12:59] <feep> I think it's unique to scooters.
[23:13:18] <saturn2> i don't think it's really possible to highside or lowside on an e-scooter
[23:13:35] <ggreer> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWeh-EvJ6Y <-- highside on a motorcycle. the rear wheel loses grip, then catches again
[23:13:36] <Robomot> 2014 MotoGP Indy FP Bautista highside - YouTube
[23:14:19] <feep> oic yeah that's not relevant for scooter injuries imo
[23:14:22] <saturn2> i mean you could if you really really tried, but it doesn't seem likely under normal conditions
[23:14:39] <feep> scooter accidents are all like "suddenly the front wheel stops"
[23:14:55] <feep> ie. because you hit a curb or are doing a hard brake
[23:15:04] <ggreer> it probably depends on how good the brakes are on the scooter's rear wheel
[23:15:14] * gwern notes his little shrew friend is still around
[23:15:14] <feep> nn
[23:15:30] <feep> ggreer: keep in mind over here scooters are hard limited to 20km/h by law
[23:15:48] <feep> also I think they tend to be fwd
[23:15:51] <ggreer> if the front wheel stops or loses grip, you're going to lowside immediately
[23:16:24] <feep> I really don't -- do you have a lowside example?
[23:16:47] * feep looks
[23:16:51] <feep> yeah that is not what will happen with a scooter.
[23:17:08] <feep> ggreer: you are seriously underestimating the degree to which that thing will instantly rotate around the front wheel if given cause
[23:17:25] <feep> scooters are almost entirely top heavy
[23:18:07] * feep reads up
[23:18:15] <feep> ggreer: agh, I just realized I forgot to say "escooter" at any point
[23:18:19] <feep> this is about those small things
[23:19:15] <saturn2> if you start to lowside you can just step onto the ground
[23:19:24] <feep> you are missing the problem
[23:19:34] <feep> owait, if you slide
[23:19:35] <feep> yes
