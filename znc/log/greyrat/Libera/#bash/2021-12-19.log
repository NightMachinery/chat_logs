[00:24:09] <alschaapman> I could use some information about the implications of preserving environment variables with sudo
[00:25:53] <alschaapman> Today I've started using pyenv to manage multiple python installations and unfortunately one of my programs that needs an old (non-system) python version also needs to be run as root. It works with pyenv the way I expect it to when I pass -E to sudo, but in general I am hesitant to preserve my environment when running things as root
[00:26:25] <alschaapman> That's really just based on my gut, though
[00:32:11] <twkm> the idea is that things you might not know about can bite, so usually a cleaned environment is safer.
[00:34:05] *** libc is now known as [[[R]]]]
[00:34:13] <alschaapman> I see
[00:34:43] <alschaapman> `sudo --preserve-env=HOME,PYENV_ROOT,PYENV_VERSION <command>` also works

[00:36:36] <alschaapman> I don't like --preserve-env=HOME for sudo with -s or -i, because this causes my own bashrc to be sourced instead of root's
[00:36:41] <rendar> `tail -n +$(( keep + 1 ))` or `tail -n "+$(( keep + 1 ))"` which is better?
[00:37:15] <dextercd> alschaapman: HOME=/root sudo ...

[00:37:29] *** Quits: libc (~weechat@user/tessio) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[00:39:51] <twkm> better is subjective.  quoted is potentially safer in case some idiot/prankster set IFS to a/some digits.
[00:41:44] <alschaapman> How safe should I consider it to preserve HOME when running a single command via sudo? I'm not exactly clear on what all Bash uses $HOME for, other than, as I said, I see that it impacts which startup files get sourced
[00:43:49] <twkm> HOME might be used by the command, writing into user foo's directory a file that might be only accessable by root.  whether that's a safety issue depends.

[07:25:54] <jaggz> there's a post here which builds a list with ps, then kills.. it just sat there on my system (probably because it iteratively calls itself) https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/124127/kill-all-descendant-processes
[07:26:31] <cryptonector> I mean, if it's a whole process group, just kill the group
[07:26:50] <cryptonector> "Negative PID values may be used to choose whole  process  groups"
[07:26:56] <jaggz> cryptonector, i saw the - .. yeah..
[07:27:01] <jaggz> but didn't know how to get the process group id
[07:27:10] <cryptonector> anything else is not going to be reliable, but only because PIDs are _terrible_
[07:27:18] <jaggz> (figured I could find it in /proc)
[07:27:21] <cryptonector> ps can tell you the pgid
[07:27:23] <jaggz> but then I wasn't sure if it was shared
[07:27:52] <cryptonector> use the -o option and include the pgrp coulumn

[10:55:12] <bud> but, keeping a global variable (_file_log) that's either stderr or a file, and appending messages to it. will be sufficient logging for most bash scripts.
[10:55:33] <yitz> !exec
[10:55:33] <greybot> exec [command] [redirections] # With a command, replace the shell process with the new command; without a command, apply the redirections to the current shell process. http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/exec http://mywiki.wooledge.org/FileDescriptor

[11:22:57] <bud> "safest" would be to not use external programs at all, but that would also make bash completely useless since it is mostly used as glue code (if not as a interactive shell, where external programs also play a role..)

[13:39:00] <geirha> p-i-: you can modify the python script to add sys.stdout.flush() at various points to have it flush more often, or you can tell it to not buffer at all with -u
[13:39:08] <bud> https://0x0.st/-CS6.sh <- hejux
[13:39:23] <bud> BASH_REMATCH is an array
[13:39:29] <geirha> p-i-: also, you're missing vital quotes.  $@  is wrong. You ALWAYS surround $@ in double quotes. "$@"
[13:39:30] <p-i-> geirha: Super! `print(i, flush=True)` sorts it
[13:39:38] <p-i-> tx
[13:39:41] <bud> [0] is the whole match, [1] is the first captured group
[13:39:54] <bud> in the regex only one group is used ([0-9])
[13:40:09] <p-i-> Now I have one final problem. When I ctrl+c to quit out of the `tail -f` it's actually killing the script. So I'm unable to `kill $pid`.
[13:40:11] <pj> p-i-: instead of using tail use tee: python foo.py > >(tee log.txt) 2>&1, assuming that what you're after is to both log the output and view it.
[13:40:15] <p-i-> How to solve this?
[13:40:20] <bud> if you had more groups in the regex you can get them with BASH_REMATCH[2] ...
[13:41:01] <pj> !BASH_REMATCH
[13:41:01] <greybot> The =~ operator of [[ evaluates the left hand string against the right hand ERE (see <ere>, <regex>). After a successful match, the BASH_REMATCH array contains the matched string and subexpressions (if any). Any quoted characters in the ERE become literal. Best to put the whole ERE in a variable: [[ $string =~ $regex ]]
[13:41:02] <geirha> trap 'kill "$pid"' EXIT
[13:41:30] <p-i-> Don't I need to trap the `tail -f` tho?
[13:41:35] <p-i-> `kill` is never getting hit

[14:06:44] <bud> ok, then i suggest re='tmux ([0-9]+)'
[14:08:40] <bud> is that the reason, why i cannot do [[ $var =~ a\sb ]]?
[14:08:41] <hejux> yeah, if there is a single quote, then no need \s or [[:space]]
[14:09:12] <geirha> bud: that's a different matter. bash will replace \s with s before passing it to the regex function

[14:12:28] <Patsie> and just print the data itself
[14:12:42] <geirha> indeed. The only way to get \s passed to the regex engine is to put it in a variable
[14:13:10] <skered> Why don't you just use awk to verify the output?
[14:14:15] <geirha> bash has this somewhat weird thing where if any of the parts of the regex is quoted, it gets somehow passed to the regex engine as "match this literally",  so [[ ... =~ \\s ]]  will match literally  backslash s
[14:14:35] <geirha> it's meant to be similar to how pattern matching with the = operator works
[14:14:41] <bud> is there any reason bash doesn't implement its own regex parser?

[22:16:38] <earnestly> So why can't you do what gnoo mentioned?  Why did the need for recusive self-execution come into the discussion?
[22:17:03] *** Quits: libc (~weechat@user/tessio) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[22:17:04] <lavaball> that was my first idea. i went to infinite loop after.
[22:17:25] <earnestly> That's fine then
[22:19:17] <lavaball> so just like with awk the bang thing at the top starts bash, and so the wait waits for everything background in that instance.
[22:19:21] <lavaball> figured it out!
[22:23:18] <lavaball> question is, does a loop count as a background process?
[22:23:40] <lavaball> or a function.
[22:24:16] <earnestly> lavaball: It's a compound command
[22:24:22] *** Quits: artix_live_1 (~loouom@144.208.201.95) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:24:30] <earnestly> And no, the 'bang thing', if you mean #!, does not start bash
[22:24:55] <earnestly> It tells the kernel it is a 'script' and whatever comes after #! is the interpreter it needs to execute for it
[22:25:04] <lavaball> but why does wait then not wait for everything else already running in the background. how does it know what's in the script and what's outside?
[22:25:25] <earnestly> It doesn't know what's 'outside', that's the point.  It can only know about its children
[22:25:55] <Enissay> What would be the best way to read lines from a large file (millions of lines) in chunks of 1k lines and concatenate them to be then used within the script ?
[22:26:08] <lavaball> awk.
[22:27:16] <earnestly> Enissay: fold -b 1024?
[22:27:46] <earnestly> Enissay: split -b 1k?
[22:28:22] <earnestly> Whatever problem you have, it might be better solved using a different approach as well

[22:30:41] <lavaball> i still don't get the children thing. but the fortress people are here. gotta go.
[22:30:44] <lavaball> thanks for your help.
