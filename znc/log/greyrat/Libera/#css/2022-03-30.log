[11:42:42] <FunkyBob> jargon: oil pipe?
[11:42:50] <FunkyBob> as far as replicating what I did...
[11:42:58] <FunkyBob> the very first clause is most of what you need
[11:43:07] <FunkyBob> did you try to understand _any_ of what I added?
[11:43:33] <jargon> I just updated it, does it look more relevant now? .__.
[11:44:01] <jargon> And yes, I figured out the oil pipe furnishing.
[11:44:58] <jargon> As for the two columns, yes all the other pages are intended to be two column for the data spreads.
[11:45:36] <jargon> The only other page not two column is the Most Recent section.
[11:45:49] <jargon> I believe anyways.
[11:48:20] <FunkyBob> so you want two page layouts...
[11:48:31] <FunkyBob> one where the content does not wrap below the nav... and one where it does?
[11:49:54] <jargon> Yes.
[11:50:04] <jargon> The main section should wrap around.
[11:50:17] <jargon> Then the Most Recent section is one block.,
[11:50:27] <jargon> Then the other sections are two columns.
[11:51:24] <jargon> Also why do I have to empty my cache in order for the .css file to update?
[11:51:41] <FunkyBob> bad server config?  dunno
[11:52:02] <FunkyBob> for the two col... how do you want vertical overflow to be handled?
[11:52:11] <jargon> ?
[11:52:13] <FunkyBob> just scroll off the page?  or should the menu stay where it is?
[11:52:26] <FunkyBob> when there's a lot of content in main
[11:52:27] <jargon> The menu should stay where it is.
[11:52:37] <FunkyBob> what about when the menu is t oo long?
[11:52:58] <jargon> Then use auto? i dunno .__.
[11:53:07] <FunkyBob> hey, it's your site
[11:53:24] <jargon> what about an independent scroll bar?
[11:54:04] <FunkyBob> ok
[11:55:37] <jargon> I already have a copy of a .css and .js and .html that performs a steampunk rotary input.

[16:14:15] <DPA> You could try something like: "* { transition: unset !important; animation-duration: 1ms !important; }"
[16:14:16] <DPA> But it won't always work, it may not always have the highest specificity, some animations may not be done purely using CSS, and it may not be ideal for repeating animations.
[16:14:16] <DPA> You could also try overriding js stuff like set timeout, to speed up things delayed using JS. But that can also have undesired side effects. setTimeout=(()=>{const setTimeoutNative=setTimeout; return (x,n,...args)=>setTimeoutNative(x,0,...args);})()
[16:16:51] <DPA> Ideally, if you have the framework sources, it may be a better idea to check if it has a config setting to disable the animations, or otherwise to just rip them right out of the source manually, and checking is stuff still works.

[21:21:41] <DPA> That's very difficult. You could try things like to duplicate the content and only scroll half the way. Or put the first one at the end when it gets there. But that breaks down if the ticker gets too big.
[21:21:41] <DPA> You could make the element a background image. That's easy in SVG, but in HTML only firefox supports it (https://jsfiddle.net/d09gjoz1/), and the element needs an ID. Also, a background image can't be interacted with.
[21:21:41] <DPA> A combination of these things would also be possible.

[21:49:40] <DPA> I suppose it would also have been possible using Adobe CSS custom filters, but it never became a thing, no browser supports it.
