[00:00:03] <saturn2> maybe they do it every day
[00:00:38] <gwern> I'm not sure. this is the first time I've seen 'putin has given the invasion order' ever. with georgia and crimea, they were enough of a surprise that I don't think there was any such step. it just went from 'there are tensions' to 'oh, russia is invading'
[00:01:37] <kuudes> also, them telling what they have heard, if true, burns their sources in russia
[00:02:49] <gwern> not really. you can't hide an invasion. there's countless possible sources, sigint and humint
[00:03:07] <kuudes> yes, but to the level "putin ordered it now"?
[00:03:15] <gwern> this isn't, "Putin told his secretary he secretly likes the Care Bears, gee, I wonder how the CIA learned about it"
[00:04:01] <gwern> an order to the entire military hierarcy is like tens of thousands of people
[00:04:19] <gwern> and we have no idea how far the order got before PBS tweeted it.

[00:09:52] <gwern> a rather low-budget hoax too
[00:10:02] <saturn2> will china invade taiwan during the olympics?
[00:10:02] <gwern> can't even afford extras or cGI for crowds
[00:10:34] <saturn2> (what if they had an olympics and nobody came?)
[00:10:48] <gwern> saturn2: that would be le mot juste, but almost certainly not. from what I understand, the naval and logistics buildup would be enormous and completely unmistakable, even more obvious than russia's ukraine buildup
[00:11:39] <phill> I think the US/sponsors are trying to put it under the rug
[00:11:39] <gwern> a cross-straits invasion with >3:1 force on tens of thousands of vessels and intense missile bombardment beforehand is just not something you go 'surprise!'
[00:11:59] <phill> Because of that athlete that went missing or something
[00:12:30] <gwern> plus, it's one thing for putin to launch an invasion during olympics other people run. it's another thing for the ccp to do it while running its own olympics and covid response
[00:13:06] <gwern> man, if china could just plain invade taiwan *in the middle of their own olympics and zero-covid lockdowns*, I'd have to give up and admit that yeah, this is the chinese century. america had a good run oh well

[00:30:56] <kuudes> I eat mostly local meat in any case, and local dairy
[00:31:35] <otoburb> California has pastures for beef too? I thought it was mostly crops, including a large percentage of almonds and avocados. 
[00:34:24] <adiabatty> some of the newer suburbs around here, well, you'll dig up some ground for a pool and turns out there's a half-rotten cow carcass buried six feet under because there used to be a ranch
[00:36:26] <adiabatty> we've got enough California to be the biggest exporter of almonds outside of Spain, and still be the second-biggest dairy producer in the US except for Wisconsin
[00:36:48] <adiabatty> I'd assume we still have a pretty big local-ish beef industry as well

[02:12:22] <ggreer> you get neon from freezing air, right? seems like any place that produces liquid gasses like argon, nitrogen, & oxygen should be able to supply it

[02:19:10] <quanticle> ggreer: In theory any place that liquefies air can distill neon; in practice, you need the actual distillation equipment to separate the neon. From what I've read, that's difficult, because neon is such a small fraction of the atmosphere.
[02:19:20] <ggreer> ah
[02:20:11] <quanticle> Also apparently neon is way more expensive than helium, because unlike helium, which accumulates in oil wells as a result of radioactive decay, the only way to get neon is through atmospheric distillation.
[02:23:13] <gwern> so you're saying nerv probably could only afford a xenon colored evangelion?
[02:23:58] <quanticle> Wasn't NERV rich?
[02:24:50] <gwern> not after all the buildings and stuff. hence all the dutct tape and stuff
[02:25:28] <quanticle> Huh. So they were like NASA, I guess. They had a lot of funding in the past, but not so much in the present.
[02:25:47] <gwern> SEELE kept NERV on a shoestring
[02:26:32] <quanticle> "Shoestring" is a relative term. Three research facilities spread across three different continents, but *not* a moon base.
[02:26:34] <quanticle> Yep.
[02:26:37] <quanticle> Shoestring.
[02:27:22] <gwern> that's why they couldn't fight off the jssdf
[02:27:57] <gwern> they were limited to solely anti-angel stuff, as seele wanted to be able to crush gendo when he betrayed them like they feared
[02:28:25] <quanticle> Well, no, they couldn't fight off the JSSDF because SEELE intervened with the mass production Evas. Otherwise Unit 02 would have done to the JSSDF attackers what every previous Angel had done: total destruction.
[02:29:03] <quanticle> Crippling overspecialization isn't the same thing as resource starvation.
[02:29:54] * gwern is pretty sure the budgeting was explicit in the series but not where exactly /shrug
[02:30:59] <quanticle> I do remember them complaining about the budget, but my impression of the complaints was that it was more like the DoD complaining about its budget. It's not a poor organization begging for scraps, it's a rich organization saying it needs *even more* in order to accomplish its mission.
[02:31:13] <quanticle> Well, maybe not DoD, specifically, but like... a defense contractor

[02:48:58] <quanticle> Oh, right
[02:49:08] <quanticle> Yeah, NERV was response to the first Angel
[02:49:50] <quanticle> So what was the plan, then? SEELE funds NERV to make the first Eva, and then SEELE takes over?
[02:50:53] <saturn2> the plan was... exactly what happened
[02:52:41] <quanticle> But whose plan? What ended up happening was (sort of) Gendo's plan, wasn't it? Only it went wrong at the last minute when Rei rejected him in favor of Shinji.
[02:53:29] <quanticle> Was SEELE's end goal also to turn everything into orange goo?
[02:55:28] <gwern> yes. existing was a mistake
[02:55:38] <saturn2> they wanted to turn themselves into orange goo... i don't think they cared what happened to anyone else

[03:35:29] <quanticle> What the fuck is an "escalope"?
[03:35:32] <pompolic> yeah talking on IRC for the first time was wild
[03:35:47] <pompolic> it was like having to wrap half the words into a semantic Maybe<> 
[03:36:04] <pompolic> and then they turned out to be genericized brand names half the time
[03:36:29] <quanticle> Acetaminophen/paracetamol still kind of blows my mind
[03:37:15] <pompolic> i may not know organic chemistry but a chemical name and drug names "feel" pretty distinct
[03:37:28] <linear> gwern: I need to save up my courage for more important things than embarrassing myself in public!
[03:37:38] <pompolic> namely, the latter have a lot more shortened english words as
[03:37:51] <pompolic> i don't actually know the english term for subunits of a word
[03:38:00] <quanticle> pompolic: Right, but acetaminophen and paracetamol are the same compound
[03:38:08] <pompolic> yes
[03:38:31] <quanticle> >gazump
[03:38:36] <pompolic> acet- , amino-, phen are all things you see in other chemical names
[03:38:40] <quanticle> Really, England?
[03:38:58] <pompolic> "cet-" "mol" are just shit that's made up to sound like it
[03:39:06] <quanticle> Ah
[03:39:54] <pompolic> they either clip english or latin words
[03:40:17] <quanticle> I think the only words I actually know on the UK side are "quango" and "yob", and that's just because I've watched _Yes, Minister_ and _Top Gear_.
[03:40:28] <pompolic> but it doesn't work because whatever DSL "acetaminophen" belongs to has a grammar that reflects the chemical's structure
[03:40:34] <pompolic> when chemists aren't ignoring it for brevity
[03:40:54] <quanticle> "Biro" is a ballpoint pen, right?
[03:41:05] <gwern> linear: nah, covid means you don't have to talk to cashiers anymore
[03:41:31] <pompolic> yeah. it actually comes from Laszlo Biro, afaik
[03:42:03] <linear> as if wearing anime/autismcore outfits in Austin wasn't already ahead, gwern attempts to encourage ahegao hoodies <_<
[03:42:08] <linear> already enough*
[03:42:53] <gwern> it's just COZE practice! as you get better, you can put the girls on your car too
[03:43:00] <pompolic> update: so it turns out "acetaminophen" is also mangled from the compound's name

[05:28:12] <gwern> true. it's totally incomparable - the USA hardly even has any troops on the border!
[05:29:17] <quanticle> And it's not like Canada is seen as some kind of ancestral predecessor to the United States, in the same way that Russia fetishizes the Kievan Rus.
[05:29:39] <nshepperd> Canada is the US's Siberia
[05:30:40] <quanticle> Does the US have a hegemonic relationship over Canada (and Mexico)? Absolutely. It's fucked up, but the important thing to note is that the US-Canada-Mexico relationship is fucked up in a very different way than Russia-Ukraine-Belarus.

[05:31:49] <quanticle> Okay, but, once again, it's not like our ancestors were Canadian or something. We don't look back to the ancient kings of Canada and trace our lineages back to when they converted to Orthodox Christianity.
[05:32:25] <gwern> our ancestors were fellow countrymen of the brits in canada! it is merely that perfidious albion foiled our attempts to liberate them from the yoke of george iii

[15:25:17] <PapuaHardyNet> The fact that Connor pulled in leo, sid, lucidrains, and some other people from TPU Podcast / shawwn's circle into building and maintaining EAI just... well, it is impressive
[15:26:07] <PapuaHardyNet> for one, it highlights the importance of a clear mission. EAI had - and still has - one supposed public stated mission: to clone GPT-3. *That* is what was missing from shawwn's attempts to build a community
[15:26:25] <PapuaHardyNet> Well, that is one of the things missing, at least.
[15:33:05] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd like to spend more time thinking of this and analyzing this. What caused EAI's success? What are its lynchpins? What part of it is replicable? How long until it implodes, the same way TPU Podcast did?
[15:35:33] <PapuaHardyNet> Honestly, I think EAI will last a *long* time. They have ties to lots of real world AI orgs (soft alumni, as it were), and also have members of the EA (effective altruist) and the rationlist community.
[15:35:55] <PapuaHardyNet> the very existence of these other orgs and communities may be enough to ensure EAI's continued thriving as a community.
[15:39:15] <nshepperd2> i gathered that TPU Podcast imploded because shawn went on tilt and alienated everybody

[15:42:02] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I wasn't there for it, so I will take your word for it. If shawwn is the one who caused TPU Pod's implosion, well. That's sad and hilarious. He was literally in the position of becoming an extremely influential person in AI research.

[19:08:04] <feepbot> <gwern> 'We use longitudinal data on the entire shopping basket of a sample of British individuals (the Kantar Worldpanel) to document substantial within-individual variation in diet quality over time.

[19:08:05] <feepbot> deviation of the share of calories from added sugar (across months) is 4 percentage points; in comparison the UK government’s sugar reduction strategy targets a 5% reduction in sugar consumption in its first year (Public Health England, 2017). We show that the variation in diet quality that we see in our data can be parsimoniously described by shifts in the share of foods that
[19:08:05] <feepbot> are contained in a healthy (e.g. fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc.) versus an unhealthy (e.g. soda, crisps, confectionery, etc.) basket.

These declines are substantial: the median decline in the share of calories from

[22:36:54] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think it should be relatively easy but possibly also unnecessary... pretty much all of these PDF patterns should be moot and the URLs already rewritten to /docs/www/foo/bar.pdf. the exceptions would be the arxiv and citeseer links... because they ban my IP when I try to mirror their PDFs
[22:37:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Anyhow, temporary special case added. Un-handled edge cases may apply. Provided without warranty. Void where prohibited.
[22:38:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: As for "unnecessary" and "pretty much all" and "exceptions would be...", well, this is exactly the kind of reasoning that we don't want to be doing in CSS
[22:38:34] <gwern> PDFs are mirrored on first-link, with no delay, so arguably we shouldn't need to consider any case other than /docs/www/.pdf
[22:38:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> This sort of logic is best encoded in actual code
[22:38:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Such that the CSS can just match a ".pdf-link" class and be done
[22:39:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, right now there are these nine selectors - how many are actually needed? Three? Eight? Two? Who knows... do we want to think about that anytime any other rule or case interacts with PDFs in any way? Absolutely not
[22:40:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, again, just let me know if it's easy to do in server code or if I should make a rewrite function in JS, that's all
[22:41:20] <gwern> I mean, my point is, if I can guarantee that all PDF links will be rewritten to local /docs/ PDF links, that seems like it might be better than either server or JS .pdf-link classes
[22:41:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's quite a guarantee to make
[22:41:50] <gwern> I'm most of the way there already. fixing the exceptions shouldn't be that hard
[22:41:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're saying that *all* these special cases will become irrelevant?
[22:42:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> To be honest, there are a few other things in links.css that should properly be handled via explicit logic in code, this is just one of them!
[22:43:15] <gwern> I think so. the link archive script downloads each URL to look at the mime type. so even PDFs which are hidden under a URL which doesn't mention 'pdf' at all should be captured and put in docs/
[22:44:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, as you like. In that case, please make a note for whenever you feel that solution is ready, that the change I just made should be revisited and the PDF selectors cleaned up. I will do that refactoring in one go at that time

[23:21:40] <Robomot> TikTok videos show Russian forces advancing closer to Ukraine - The Washington Post (Russian President Vladimir Putin and top Russian officials for months have been denying that Moscow is preparing to mount an invasion of neighboring Ukraine. But military analysts say videos posted to TikTok and other social media platforms tell another story.)

[23:31:42] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The lead author is part of the same club behind last year's infamous "Sodom and Gomorrah" airburst article that is currently under consideration for retraction from this journal. The second author seems to be just a personal friend; the UC press release calls him an alumnus and he doesn't appear on any UC website, so it's kinda dishonest to say he's affiliated with the
[23:31:42] <feepbot> department. The other authors are the guy who ran samples at the lab and some new grad students... from the biology department, one of which I'm guessing is just the daughter of the second author? This has really strong "roped some kids I know into a pet project" vibes (certainly not helped by the PowerPoint diagrams).'

[23:38:18] <quanticle> gwern: Yeah, it's remarkable how good TikTok has been as a source of OSINT on Russian troop movements. 
[23:39:20] <quanticle> It turns out that Peter Wiggins didn't need to deduce Russian unit movements by analyzing gaps in their passenger train schedules; he just needed to compile TikTok and correlate markings on military vehicles being transported by train.
