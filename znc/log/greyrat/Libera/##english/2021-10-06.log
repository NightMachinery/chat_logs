[00:05:23] <StayHungry> GuiToris has a strange way of learning the language. He comes in every day and asks if that's a phrase Americans say. But there are basics that all dialects use. How can Americans not use the gerund? :D Of course, if you ask pupils in Oregon, where reading and writing exams are about to be ditched, you can imagine that they will not use perfect tenses and other expressive means.
[00:11:14] <mdogg> Well, that's why I wanted to make the point that there was nothing wrong with using "look after" in those examples.  Because there is nothing wrong with it at all, even in America.

[01:12:55] <GuiToris> mdogg, is 'having said that' something that you would say?
[01:13:08] <GuiToris> blkshp, what do you use to measure temperature?
[01:13:16] <blkshp> A thermometer
[01:14:17] <GuiToris> are you trying to be funny or did I ask it that badly? :D
[01:14:22] <GuiToris> C or F?
[01:14:38] <blkshp> No, I answered precisely the question you asked.
[01:14:45] <blkshp> C
[01:14:46] <GuiToris> I know, I just expected something else
[01:14:54] <blkshp> Really?!
[01:14:58] <blkshp> Did you?! REALLY!?
[01:15:19] <GuiToris> I watched a scientific show which was English... English - English
[01:15:35] <blkshp> Yes?
[01:15:40] <GuiToris> and I was wondering how YOU would pronounce C
[01:15:58] <GuiToris> I call it differently
[01:16:05] <blkshp> Centigrade or celsius
[01:16:05] <GuiToris> that's it
[01:16:05] <GuiToris> centigrade
[01:16:11] <GuiToris> I think I've never heard it
[01:16:19] <GuiToris> yet another word to memorize
[01:16:26] <GuiToris> my brain is going to explode
[01:16:43] <blkshp> If you know 'celsius' just use that. You'll remember what it is now if you hear it.
[01:16:49] <blkshp> But you don't need to use it
[01:17:29] <GuiToris> it's called celsius here, so there's not much to memorize, but I'm pretty sure I'll soon forget centigrade
[01:17:45] <GuiToris> why did you invent another word?! theoretical question
[01:17:46] <blkshp> :D
[01:17:57] <blkshp> What, to mess with you?
[01:18:03] <GuiToris> I knew it

[01:29:06] <sbrown> GuiToris: Rarely. When referring to the weather, I don't think I would ever use Celsius.
[01:29:10] <GuiToris> LuisM14, the longest actually trimmed. Apparently it contains 1909 letters
[01:29:56] <GuiToris> sbrown, do your ovens use Fahrenheit as well?
[01:30:05] <bintober> yes
[01:30:10] <bintober> everything does
[01:30:26] <GuiToris> I haven't thought of this yet
[01:30:49] <GuiToris> I probably couldn't make food in America then
[01:30:57] <bintober> sure you could
[01:31:25] *** Tobbi__ is now known as Tobbi
[01:31:53] <GuiToris> bintober, yeah, with the help of gnu units
[01:32:07] <bintober> just do the conversion lol
[01:32:09] <sbrown> GuiToris: Yes, ovens are in Fahrenheit. Though if you had an electronic display, I wouldn't be surprised could be configured to use Celsius instead.
[01:33:02] <GuiToris> maybe I'll try setting ours to Fahrenheit and then try not to burn down the house
[01:33:56] <bintober> i mean you can just google xyz c in f
[01:34:00] <bintober> and youll get the result
[01:34:09] <GuiToris> bintober, don't use use $units?
[01:34:12] <GuiToris> ahh
[01:34:16] <GuiToris> either one is 'you'
[01:34:23] <bintober> I literally just google it every time
[01:34:41] <bintober> it's the easiest way. I can never remember the exact formula for conversion anyway
[01:35:01] <StayHungry> GuiToris: Germans also use long words, although there are short ones. for example, orange juice -> Orangensaft and Orangenfruchtsaftgetränk
[01:35:02] <GuiToris> I tend to use 'units' until I found out it lied to me
[01:35:11] <sbrown> GuiToris: One of the more common, non-STEM, contexts where Americans encounter temperatures in Celsius is when using a recipe written in metric units.
[01:35:19] <bintober> GuiToris: what do you mean 'units'

[01:37:08] <GuiToris> I suspect something is wrong with units. I can't rely on it anymore: $ units '10 megabyte' 'kilobit' = 80000
[01:37:31] <MetaNova> but
[01:37:38] <bintober> if I'm in the kitchen cooking and something has celsius, I do the conversion right there in the browser
[01:37:41] <MetaNova> 10 megabyes is 80000 kilobits

[01:38:36] <GuiToris> MetaNova, 10 megabytes are 10240 kilobytes, 10240 kilobytes are 81920 kilobits, I think

[01:39:16] <GuiToris> hmmm

[01:39:24] <bintober> kilobyte vs kilobit

[02:51:43] <twb> sbrown: I thought they each got two seats in the upper house
[02:52:50] <sbrown> twb: Yes, each state gets two senators. DC gets no senators at all.
[02:53:05] <sbrown> twb: The Electoral College is a different thing ... https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/2020
[02:54:24] <sbrown> twb: An in the lower house, the number of representatives is based on state population. And DC is allowed one non-voting delegate in the lower chamber.
[02:54:24] <mdogg> Correct.  And that's a political subject that I shouldn't have brought up.  
[02:55:12] <StayHungry> twb: in short, there is no direct secret ballot and that says it all :)

[02:56:52] <twb> sbrown: ah you're talking about the executive
[02:57:17] <twb> I heard that DC's representation had been fixed recently -- I assumed that meant fixed across the board, not just the executive
[02:57:20] <mdogg> Seriously, though, I should not have posted anything about our political system.  This is not the channel to discuss that.  It has nothing to do with the English language.  I apologize.
[02:58:06] <twb> were "upper house" and "lower house" literally above/below one another at one point?
[02:58:16] <twb> like in the allthing or whatever
[02:59:00] <mdogg> The upper house is called the Senate, and the lower house is called the House of Representatives.  Again, this does not belong in this channel.
[03:00:58] <sbrown> mdogg: True... there's a reason I'm not on the politics channel.

[03:02:30] <mdogg> I'm not in there either.  And I'm not going to answer political question anymore.

[03:05:30] <mdogg> I am sure there was an influence on the English language due to what took place politically throughout history, but I don't think that there is anything to gain from discussing politics here, because political discussions generally lead to people taking sides.

[03:07:42] <twb> mdogg: <wearing op hat> if I see anyone engaging in tribalism or shonky rhetoric, I'll tell them off.  Until then I don't see a problem discussing the mechanics, and especially not the etymology.
[03:08:09] <twb> sbrown: i confess the reason I remember it is because of coarse jokes referring to it as the "what thing"
[03:09:09] <twb> mdogg: the best way to divert a tedious discussion is to ask an on-topic question
[03:09:12] <sbrown> Now, it's only a matter of time until we divide ourselves warring factions -- based on IP ranges of course.
[03:11:07] <twb> sbrown: IPv4 allocations are a huge mess because the were divvyed up rather ad-hoc
[03:11:26] <mdogg> lol 
[03:11:35] <twb> This makes backbone operators mad because they need to manage huge routing tables
[03:12:19] <twb> like "1.2.3.0/28 goes to PNG, but 1.2.3.64/28 goes to Suriname"
[03:12:39] <mdogg> twb: IPv4 addresses would have been more uniform if they had let the assignments up to the Catholics.  =P

[03:29:52] <bintober> not in my experience but it probably depends on numerous factors
[03:32:02] <mdogg> When I lived in Memphis, every Sunday somebody would invite me to have supper on Sunday.  Sunday supper is a big deal for people in the southern part of the U.S. 
[03:32:41] <mdogg> Entire families would get together for that weekly meal.

[03:33:33] <mdogg> And it was an honor to be a guest in someone's house on a Sunday for supper.  
[03:33:35] <twb> "entire family" meaning like how many people?  3?  Or 300?
[03:33:57] <twb> like the entire clan McBride
[03:34:23] <mdogg> Of those that I attended, there were around 30 to 35 people when you count all the kids.
[03:35:42] <StayHungry> bintober: In the scheme that is close to you, I am surprised that dinner, coming rather in the evening, is considered the main meal. i.e. Instead of giving yourself energy to work in the afternoon, you load yourself up before the time to rest.
[03:36:07] <twb> StayHungry: this is why it's an urban vs rural thing here
[03:36:37] <twb> StayHungry: manual labourers have a large mid-day meal, whereas office workers don't because they sit on their arses

[04:59:57] <Dusan_Krehel> as with a word "convening"?
[05:00:25] <tinwhiskers> I have assisted in convening many meetings.
[05:00:59] <tinwhiskers> (I'm not quite sure what your question means, but that part is incorrect)
[05:02:43] <Dusan_Krehel> is the "convening" as adjective or as "verb"
[05:02:59] <tinwhiskers> a verb
[05:03:37] <Dusan_Krehel> why then so "in"? i know, in is a before adjectine
[05:04:17] <tinwhiskers> "assisting in" = "assisting with"
[05:05:06] <tinwhiskers> you are assisting in the process of convening a meeting.

[17:56:36] <twb> The only part of that which is rude is "English is probably not your first language".
[17:57:16] <twb> "We couldn't understand" is good; it's better than "you can't be understood"
[17:57:57] <twb> I usually say: "Sorry, I don't understand 'XXX'.  Can you rephrase the question?"
[17:58:23] <ln> Looney: Is India not in Asia?
[17:58:57] <twb> ln: Americans use "Asia" to mean specifically East Asia -- China, Korea, Korea, Japan, and some rounding errors.
[17:59:35] <ln> Makes sense.
[17:59:49] <twb> ln: for example their last census considers people from Saudi Arabia to be "white" not "asian".
[18:00:45] <ln> That, on the other hand, doesn't make sense.
[18:00:50] <twb> And IIRC their 1910(ish) census considered Punjabi Muslims to be of "hindoo race" >_<
[18:00:55] <TimMc> Ah yes, Europe and Asia, the only two parts of that continent. :-)
[18:01:15] <TimMc> let's just not think about the Middle East, or Russia for that matter
[18:02:09] <twb> Ultimately it derives from scientific racism, which in turn derives from the Torah (the story of Noah).
[18:02:38] <TimMc> Hindu Muslims, haha

[18:27:59] <pycode> what is the difference between representative and sales rep ?

[18:29:11] <bintober> my dad was VP of sales for a financial company which is much more than just a representative, but he would go out and find and wine-and-dine clients from the c-suite level
[18:29:14] <Looney> I found this page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturers%27_representative

[21:10:09] <pussipupu> The future's Orange
[21:10:18] <tzf-[m]> What does coined means?
[21:10:41] <twb> tzf-[m]: "to coin a phrase", means inventing it and making it popular
[21:10:45] <huf> pussipupu: more orban?
[21:11:12] <twb> pussipupu: ah I didn't realize it was a neologism, but meh.  I'd still call it Finnish

[21:11:39] <twb> "bumguzzler" isn't in any dictionary, but I'd call it English
[21:11:47] <tzf-[m]> Oh, like : " hey hey hey ! I'm Al Kavadlo, and we are working out ! " that coining, right?
[21:12:26] <twb> tzf-[m]: sorry, I don't understand that.  It is by analogy to coining (minting) actual physical coins.
[21:13:30] <pussipupu> It fits with a common naming pattern for marsupials
[21:15:27] <huf> we had a whole cultural movement where a few people made up a lot of really stupid new words
[21:15:31] <huf> only some of them stuck
[21:17:33] <pussipupu> There was a thing for coining “native” terms a while back, but like last-but-one century
[21:17:42] <huf> yeah
[21:17:53] <huf> for us I think it was the late 1700s? something like that?
[21:18:28] <huf> to be fair, these people also wrote down dialectal words and brought them back to the capital
[21:18:44] <huf> and some of each kind worked out. most of course died fast

[22:52:03] <blkshp> A shower is a contraption where you'd usually stand and get sprinkled by water. A bth you lie in horizontally in a big puddle of warm water.

[23:19:44] <blkshp> Washing machines are better on the concrete of the ground floor.
[23:19:55] <placeb0> why?
[23:20:26] <blkshp> Washing machines are generally heavy and shake the ground below them quite a lot.

[23:21:29] <pussipupu> but the bathroom is in the cellar, and there's no plumbing on the top floor
