[02:02:05] <int0x1C8> yeah, but seeing that hiring sign in the store the other day really tells me I need to gtfo of this job
[02:02:51] <int0x1C8> because at this point I think I'd gladly just do fucking grocery stocking overnights for more money than the workload I'm under here
[02:03:19] <haljhon> might be a nice break?
[02:03:38] <haljhon> I considered being a cashier just to get a mental break and make a little extra money.
[02:03:56] <haljhon> but it's a little hard to be like, "Hey manager, I have a business trip next week so I can't work at all."
[02:04:00] <haljhon> they tend to frown on that.

[06:37:12] <a1> why are they able to access your vcenter?
[06:37:19] <Shiromara> not vcenter.. single vsphere host
[06:37:25] <a1> why are they able to access it
[06:37:26] <Shiromara> but that indeed is a good question
[06:38:02] <Shiromara> normally it should be closed. rest i have to see
[06:38:03] <a1> so they created the vm?

[06:46:09] <Shiromara> so far i can't quite tell.. only from cpu usage that the host was at 100% till i cut the net connection and that there was diverse net traffic. when i look at the datastore themselves there is nothing

[06:49:43] <Shiromara> buy me dinner first
[06:50:16] <csws> this is weird
[06:50:28] <csws> I thought that RCE only affected a component in vcenter?
[06:50:53] <Shiromara> does the html5 exploit also go for the new gui in vsphere hosts?
[06:51:14] <Shiromara> else there is nothing a vpshere hosts uses
[06:54:14] <Shiromara> https://imgur.com/a/89WKZoX

[07:37:36] <barred_owl> hey zyk
[07:39:03] <Hunterkll> We can't really use CentOS anymore due to a lot of contract requireemnts, but ...... which is kind of annoying, because centos stream is basically the same way we configure our appstream setup in RHEL8 so the change doesn't really impact us, and for some internal only stuff we can use it..... but too many contractual/regulatory/etc requirements to not have vendor support on a lot of stuff
[07:39:41] <barred_owl> Use AIX like real people
[07:40:31] <a1> Hunterkll: i know that is a common contractual requirement, are you aware of the overarching documentation that lays out that requirement or is it something your company implemented?
[07:40:43] <Hunterkll> what
[07:40:44] <a1> because it's something my contract has argued about
[07:41:02] <a1> "product<s> must have vendor support"
[07:41:09] <barred_owl> software with hidden, undocumented features that only the vendor knows--priceless
[07:41:16] <Hunterkll> a1: i could point at everything from federal regulation to individual project requirements to etc
[07:41:31] <a1> could you point me to the federal regulation?
[07:41:36] <Hunterkll> which one?
[07:41:36] <a1> legit haven't read it
[07:41:41] <a1> idk you're the miracle man
[07:41:46] <Hunterkll> i'm talking hundreds, potentially thousands
[07:41:47] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:42:00] <a1> just the first 150 then
[07:42:01] <a1> ;)
[07:42:16] <Hunterkll> it all depends on the ridiculous situation you find yourself in of what MIGHT be applicable
[07:42:26] <PrincessZoey> https://i.imgur.com/Ys1fq1J.png
[07:42:28] <a1> actually i have some other questions you might be able to answer some time we have argued about
[07:42:37] <Hunterkll> a1: but with 'vendor support' doesn't necessarily mean a support contract
[07:42:44] <a1> true
[07:42:57] <a1> generally in our terms we take it to mean support contract unfortunately
[07:43:16] <barred_owl> PrincessZoey, well take thee to a nunnery.  that is really fucking nice
[07:43:39] <Hunterkll> like, with microsoft software - if you don't have an EA/premier support, you can say that the $499 per incident pro support is your vendor support option 
[07:43:43] <PrincessZoey> I had to drive 500 miles to get it, but it was $400 less than amazon wanted.
[07:44:17] <Hunterkll> Also, you could theroetically say that an outlined plan witof support with security updates to be an 'in support' product
[07:44:50] <a1> I just need to find the document for my project requirements
[07:45:14] <a1> but then again
[07:45:16] <a1> do I really care that much?
[07:45:21] <Hunterkll> obviously, with linux vendors, you need a support contract, but that's built into the license cost itself. 
[07:45:22] <Hunterkll> well
[07:45:28] <Hunterkll> that'll be in the contract for the project
[07:45:49] <a1> yeah.. but I don't know if I care enough to read / look over it
[07:46:47] <Hunterkll> i mean, that's what legal etc are for 
[07:48:49] <Hunterkll> but i'd take "vendor support" to mean either .... a support contract, the easiest route, or a pay-per-incident style level of support also as well
[07:49:58] <Hunterkll> and then you have to look at scope too - like, does it need to cover the hardware too? or just the software? or is it a vendor that covers both at once like cisco?
[07:51:01] <Hunterkll> like say, our couple racks of supermicro kit..... technically we have support for them, but it's a 3rd party vendor who assembled the kit for us and handles warranty redemption etc
[07:53:14] <barred_owl> a1, is this for a govt contract?
[07:53:22] <a1> no just a book store
[07:53:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:53:48] <barred_owl> keep it simple and stupid
[07:53:53] <a1> it's a big book store
[07:54:04] <barred_owl> buy a cray while you are at it
[07:54:12] <a1> i have a sun microsystems e10000
[07:54:14] <a1> does that count
[07:54:36] <barred_owl> better yet, no one ever got fired for recommending an ibm
[07:59:14] <barred_owl> a1, you could ask hadji from india for a support contract too?  :P

[09:42:59] <enix> When I say rural too, I'm not talking about the communist shacks "living off hte land", i'm talking about a place like Gympie QLD which has a hospital, ambulance service, it's basically a small, self-sufficient township 
[09:43:23] <DrZak> so a small city then?
[09:43:26] <enix> That's still considered 'rural' expect it's not rural at all. Yet some of the fringe suburbs get 4G internet
[09:43:28] <DrZak> and you got shit network there too ?
[09:43:38] <DrZak> i seee
[09:43:41] <enix> More township than city but semantics
[09:45:05] <DrZak> well 20k ppl that's pretty much a city
[09:45:15] <enix> you have very low standards :P
[09:45:34] <DrZak> i am from a tiny place :)

[09:46:15] <enix> ah haha
[09:46:25] <DrZak> eh, looking at that gympie - high temperatures in winter 30c :)))

[09:46:45] <enix> Or are you looking at month instead of season?
[09:47:02] <enix> Right now, the areas probably like 15 degrees or something
[09:47:06] <DrZak> yea, looking at wiki for gympie, it says record high in jun/jul 30c
[09:47:09] <enix> 22
[09:47:16] <enix> ah thats surprising
[09:47:38] <DrZak> 15 is lovely, its time to wear shorts

[09:48:06] <DrZak> it got unbearable
[09:48:15] <enix> 35 dry or wet?
[09:48:20] <DrZak> dry
[09:48:32] <DrZak> yea, 35 and humid, no thx
[09:48:49] <DrZak> i was ok with 50+ c in egypt, coz it was dry
[09:48:57] <enix> heh i used to live in FNQ, 35 humid is nice af
[09:49:00] <enix> 50+ get out
[09:49:06] <DrZak> but if it gets humid, good god, nope
[09:49:28] <enix> Fucking hell it does get to 50... I need to experience this. That sounds interesting as fuck

[10:35:37] <JollyRgrs> what did you need internet facing host for?
[10:35:45] <csws> i've got 4 esxi boxes exposed to the net
[10:35:45] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> but I didn't feel like spending another $300 for a baremetal host for a firewall

[10:36:00] <csws> buuutttttt
[10:36:02] <enix> I mean
[10:36:04] <enix> YOU COULD VIRTUALIZE IT
[10:36:08] <Jay-Ros> apparently...
[10:36:15] <Jay-Ros> I've been told
[10:36:20] <Jay-Ros> THE HEAT IS ON
[10:36:21] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I did virtualize it
[10:36:23] <csws> I setup the shitty internal firewall and only whitelisted IPs I own for any incoming ports
[10:36:27] <Jay-Ros> THE HEAT IS Oh-ON
[10:36:33] <JollyRgrs> just have the internet go straight to opnsense in a VM
[10:36:34] <Jay-Ros> IT'S ON THE STREET
[10:36:39] <JollyRgrs> fixed
[10:37:05] <JollyRgrs> but i mean, if you are using some residential gateway... that also has firewall capabilities
[10:37:06] <Jay-Ros> just forward 3389
[10:37:21] <csws> I have another idea to improve the security if this gets worse
[10:37:28] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> JollyRgrs that's how it's setup. But until the dust settles and we have more info I'm just shutting everything down
[10:38:18] <csws> basically got a vmk NIC attached to the internal network that is reachable over IPsec, static routes setup and whatnot, all the vcenter traffic goes over this link so it's pretty reliable
[10:38:19] <JollyRgrs> either you don't understand basic networking or I (and others) have a VERY HORRIBLE understanding of some janky setup
[10:38:35] <csws> I might just close down the external facing management port altogether and rely on the shitty windows TS as a break glass if the tunnel dies.
[10:38:41] <csws> that one has the firewall setup similarly too
[10:41:20] <csws> i'm genuinely confused why you expose it to the net telgareith
[10:41:21] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> JollyRgrs. I understand just fine. If these machines had any sort of SLA at all they'd still be running. But it's obvious that VMware hasn't given us the whole truth, we don't know how the exploit works- because clearly it works on non vcenter ESXi hosts,
[10:41:39] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> none of the ESXi side is exposed
[10:41:43] <csws> I kinda don't have a choice when initially setting these things up as I can't get a private network in some rando datacentre where I have one box lol
[10:42:11] <csws> so I just finish the setup and race to put in the crappy vsphere firewall rules
[10:42:46] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I map a physical NIC to a vswitch/portgroup that belongs to the 'hot zone' which is PFsense's WAN port, and the ESXI management goes on a completely seperate physical NIC
[10:43:32] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> but that still leaves VMware moving the packets around as a possible vector
[10:43:48] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> likely?
[10:43:50] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> fuck no
[10:45:14] <Hunterkll> <sd> <t​elgareith> I had an internet facing ESXi host
[10:45:14] <Hunterkll> <sd> <t​elgareith> management port wasn't exposed
[10:45:14] <Hunterkll> <sd> <t​elgareith> but two vNICs and a portgroup/vswitch was
[10:45:18] <Hunterkll> then the host itself wasn't exposed
[10:45:20] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> but when I had another PFsense baremetal box sitting in the closet on location configured and just had to walk dad through finding out which ports I used for WAN and LAN, and a few tidbits
[10:45:28] <Hunterkll> virtual firewalls are used all over the fuckin' place
[10:45:35] <Hunterkll> if it was just a physical nic hooked to a vswitch
[10:45:37] <Hunterkll> anyway
[10:45:59] <Hunterkll> that means there was no exposure (except if there were somehow a raw packet processing vulnerability in the vswitch code)
[10:46:14] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> which I just fucking said was a possibility
[10:46:18] <Hunterkll> that's literally SOP for running virtual internet firewalls 
[10:46:33] <Hunterkll> yea, an obscenely distant remote possibility
[10:46:39] <Hunterkll> given the recent vulns were management stack stuff 
[10:46:57] <Hunterkll> it's not even worth considering for the most part, because of the threat model
[10:47:12] <Hunterkll> i'd be more concerned about the router VM itself having vulnerabilities
[10:47:18] <Hunterkll> or something inside the network hitting hte VMware management side

[11:50:00] <Hunterkll> and thank god they haven't

[16:39:01] <csws> but if it's registered as a rifle and you cut it below 16" then you're screwed right
[16:39:23] <yuken> basically, csws. Although you don't "register" it as a rifle, they aren't registered at all in the US.
[16:39:43] <yuken> The only firearms that get registered in the country (federally and in 99% of US states) are NFA items (machine guns, silencers, "short barreled" items)

[16:48:32] <crustacean> Same AV, AM, VOIP

[16:51:40] <xe0n> yup
[16:53:10] <AnimalFarmPig> seriously, I've seen faulty usb devices causes crashes-- not a driver problem, but a problem with the hardware itself. If you're suspicious about the headset, unplug it and see if crashes go away, or plug it in to another box and see if the crashes follow it.
[16:53:23] <xe0n> yup
[16:53:26] <xe0n> basic troubleshooting lol
[16:53:50] <xe0n> i've been more leaning towards....confirm if it IS the usb thing lol

[20:06:00] <grumplestiltzkin> I plugged in a laptop, and stuff was a bit blurry, but it's running at 24 HZ
[20:06:18] <JollyRgrs> 24hz? what?
[20:06:24] <grumplestiltzkin> I'll test something better this week. 
[20:06:44] <grumplestiltzkin> on the 4k tv. to be used as like 4-6 status monitors
[20:06:59] <JollyRgrs> but i mean, you can only run it at 24 hz?
[20:07:08] <JollyRgrs> so you can only really do film, not even TV broadcasts?
[20:07:21] <grumplestiltzkin> with the laptop output I was using, yeah.
[20:07:34] <JollyRgrs> weird
[20:07:53] <JollyRgrs> 24hz won't make it blurry unless you were trying to play a game or something
[20:07:56] <grumplestiltzkin> presumablyif I use something that can drive that many pixels, it will be better - but I still need to check it out. I literally picked it up yesterday, and just plugged in a laptop
[20:08:11] <JollyRgrs> oh, was the laptop output not 4k 24hz?
[20:08:26] <grumplestiltzkin> 24hz was the only choice at 4k
[20:08:35] <grumplestiltzkin> and it didn't like downsizing
[20:08:38] <JollyRgrs> it shouldn't make blurry though
[20:08:50] <JollyRgrs> esp. if it is just monitoring graphs, etc.
[20:08:51] <grumplestiltzkin> but also linux default 'display' tool. I didn't get deep into it
[20:09:41] <JollyRgrs> ah, if text is blurry, maybe cleartext type settings
[20:09:43] <grumplestiltzkin> I literally picked it up yesterday and looked at it for 10 minutes, saying hey I have one, going to check it out, looks weird so far.    But also sharing the deal if anyone else wants in.  43" 4k screen for $220
[20:10:03] <JollyRgrs> yeah, that's a good deal
[20:10:32] <JollyRgrs> I want to replace the TV in the playroom... but I can't justify it b/c the kids are getting older now and consumptions ahve changed... now they mostly watch stuff on phones or their computers
[20:10:42] <grumplestiltzkin> its super light, under 20 lbs I think, and it comes with some feet that you dont need to attack.    it also *has* the screws for a vesa bracket already 
[20:11:30] <grumplestiltzkin> I think it just has an on/off button on the bottom. I put it in 'store mode' and it appears to be happy like that, just being a monitor
[20:11:50] <JollyRgrs> what? lol
[20:11:53] <grumplestiltzkin> but that also might be why it looked weird.  I'd more chalk it up to straining resources on the laptop
[20:11:55] <JollyRgrs> store mode? srsly? dude...
[20:11:58] <grumplestiltzkin> yeah
[20:12:05] <JollyRgrs> you want to blast that blue light, eh?
[20:12:08] <grumplestiltzkin> its 'insignia', which iirc is the bestbuy store brand
[20:12:11] <JollyRgrs> it is
[20:12:17] <JollyRgrs> and store mode is for just displaying

[20:16:09] <grumplestiltzkin> JollyRgrs, yeah, I'd imagine there are a lot of options. initial reaction is it feels flimsy, and looks weird, but again, only had a few minutes with it plugged into a laptop where I was fiddling with settings to get picture on it and see what I could do last night

[20:16:47] <JollyRgrs> grumplestiltzkin: my kids have insignia dumb TVs in both of their rooms. bought them a year ago and it was cheaper than teh smart options at the time by like 50 or $100
[20:16:58] <JollyRgrs> i think it was sub $150 for each TV about that same size
[20:17:05] <JollyRgrs> i mean... they work
[20:17:13] <grumplestiltzkin> orly?
[20:17:19] <JollyRgrs> not super high quality, not a lot of options in the menu... but that's not what i bought them for
[20:17:23] <JollyRgrs> they should last a good bit
[20:17:51] <JollyRgrs> there's only so many (which is not many) MFGs of the actual screens and components, they are just all rebranded and have diff firmwares
[20:18:07] <grumplestiltzkin> the specs say 4k, 60hz
[20:18:09] <JollyRgrs> so for basic needs, idc so much about brand
[20:18:17] <JollyRgrs> yeah, that should be fine
[20:18:36] <JollyRgrs> your laptop prob. couldn't support 30 or 60hz at 4k... or maybe your hdmi cable couldn't

[20:54:10] <tenthshift> we don't have cpanel

[23:33:13] <riff_IRC> 18.04 is tolerable after executing Snap, gutting out Netplan and replacing it with ifupdown, and throwing unattended-updates off a bridge at 75mph.
