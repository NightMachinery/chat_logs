[01:18:36] <elshize> bsd4me: from what I heard from others (not using windows myself) wsl works pretty well. it can even run gui apps allegedly, so I'd assume it would run neomutt just fine :)

[03:42:34] <flatcap> I was worried it was going to be the 67 functions that lay behind them
[03:43:05] <flatcap> plus you'd need to add a helper function to get the status of a config variable
[03:46:30] <phoebos> o/ are there any ways you can think of for working out what's causing neomutt so long to load? i have local mboxes, the config files aren't stupidly long, and sometimes it opens quickly, but often it takes maybe two seconds until the interface pops up
[03:49:04] <flatcap> try running with debugging enabled:  `neomutt -d6` then look in `~/.neomuttdebug0` for any long pauses
[03:50:04] <flatcap> one thing that can occasionally cause trouble is a hostname lookup.
[03:50:14] <flatcap> adding config: set hostname = 'your-hostname.com'  would help there
[03:56:19] <dcpurton> flatcap: , is it possible to turn off your window debugging without re-compiling?
[03:57:03] <dcpurton> log file is a bit noisy :)
[03:58:44] <flatcap> hehe, no sorry
[03:59:23] <flatcap> it all goes through debug_win_dump() so `return;` would stop it all
[03:59:35] <flatcap> do you know about / use `ccache` ?
[04:00:43] <dcpurton> no?
[04:00:52] <flatcap> oh!  install it now!

[04:01:08] <flatcap> it's a cache for build products
[04:01:33] <flatcap> if you build the same code frequently, as we do, it pulls the .o from the cache rather than rebuilding
[04:02:07] <dcpurton> My programming experience consists of one introductory level enginering course back in the 90s and whatever I've self taught over the years…
[04:02:13] <flatcap> the ./configure will still take several seconds, but builds will be much quicker
[04:02:23] <flatcap> ah, fair enough
[04:02:57] <flatcap> the build should pick up ccache automatically
[04:04:14] <dcpurton> that sounds easy!
[04:04:23] <flatcap> yeah
[04:04:28] <flatcap> it's very reliable.  I think it preprocesses the files, then takes a hash of the result and stores the .o against it
[04:04:46] <flatcap> so if the file changes in any way, it'll get rebuilt
[04:04:56] <flatcap> (or its dependencies)
[04:05:52] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[04:10:35] <dcpurton> Oh! That does make a difference!
[04:10:57] <flatcap> :-)
[04:11:20] <flatcap> it stores up to 5GB in ~/.ccache (configurable)
[04:11:35] <dcpurton> I should remove that from my backups…
[04:11:45] <flatcap> you can also `ccache -z` to clear the stats, build and `ccache -s` to see the hit rate
[04:12:12] <dcpurton> Ah, Debian puts it in ~/.cache/
[04:13:13] <flatcap> I have a /home/dirty directory for that sort of thing
[04:13:32] <flatcap> caches and all those ****ing python files, etc
[04:14:46] <phoebos> flatcap: ah thanks! it was getaddrinfo indeed
[04:14:52] <flatcap> np
[04:16:10] <phoebos> re ccache: i had about 5GB of it, and recently cleared it all. after the first run to recreate the cache, the lookup times were much faster
[04:16:58] <flatcap> hmm... odd, I wouldn't have expected any slowdown as it fills up
[04:17:22] <flatcap> but I don't really know how it works -- it's magic!

[13:51:52] <flatcap> morning all
[14:00:22] <dcpurton> morning flatcap
[14:00:57] <dcpurton> I have added one more minor feature, so you can now (within reason) delete groups and grouped attachments.
[14:01:25] <dcpurton> And put a basic set of tests in https://github.com/neomutt/test-compose/tree/main/dcpurton
[14:01:34] <flatcap> hi dcpurton 
[14:01:43] <flatcap> nice
[14:01:50] <dcpurton> These tests should cover the majority of normal use cases. Unless your deliberately trying to break it
[14:02:03] <flatcap> hehe
[14:02:36] * flatcap builds ...
[14:02:49] <dcpurton> As for next, I guess just fixing any other problems you find and tidying up code in whatever way you see fit
[14:04:30] <flatcap> great
[14:04:36] * flatcap reads the tests README...
[14:05:57] <flatcap> it'd be nice to reduce the number of commits, somewhat
[14:06:50] <flatcap> if you can think of some "units" of work that'd make sense, I can help with the git-wrangling if you want
[14:09:05] <dcpurton> yes… at present there's no guarantee every commit behaves in an expected way
[14:09:24] <flatcap> yeah
[14:11:28] <flatcap> actually, let's leave that 'til we're completely done changing the code
[14:13:27] <flatcap> I'll try to make time to doc my method for merging commits
[14:15:00] <dcpurton> OK
[14:18:29] <dcpurton> Or you could just make 1 commit 😉️
[14:20:59] <flatcap> :-)

[14:50:05] <dcpurton> now they PASS
[14:50:13] <flatcap> all pass!

[14:55:28] <dcpurton> Hmmm. Actually if I put echo -e in the Makefile it prints "-e"
[14:55:32] <dcpurton> I see colour
[14:55:56] <dcpurton> is echo built into bash or Make?
[14:56:09] <flatcap> oh
[14:56:34] <flatcap> I changed the line to

[14:57:57] <dcpurton> with [PASS] in green
[14:57:57] <flatcap> echo is a shell builtin, `type echo`, but there's also a real version /usr/bin/echo `which echo`
[14:58:04] <flatcap> weird
[14:58:33] <dcpurton> win
[14:59:08] <dcpurton> so. /usr/bin/echo -e $(PASS) works
[15:00:09] <dcpurton> BTW, I'm not commited to that Makefile. It's just thrown together. And I'm not very familiar with make.
[15:00:29] <flatcap> it's ok. it does the job

[16:09:38] <dcpurton> flatcap: It might be hard to make sensible units for the commits ☹️. The code is kind of all or nothing, unless you add in (ultimately) redundant error checking.
[16:10:42] <dcpurton> Part of the problem is that the grouping code in master never really worked properly at all. It's something of a fluke it manages to produce a valid email at all.
[16:12:02] <dcpurton> You could do: 1. Grouping in compose, 2. Postponing and Recalling, 3. Documentation, 4. Tests
[16:12:14] <dcpurton> But that seems fairly sparse
[16:12:36] <flatcap> yeah, fair point
[16:13:32] <flatcap> it seems a shame for all that work to boil down to one commit -- one green dot on github
[16:13:43] <dcpurton> Haha
[16:14:41] <dcpurton> Even putting the split before I did nested groups is tricky because there were bugs in the single level grouping code that were fixed during the nested grouping commits
[16:15:41] <flatcap> I'll have a look and think later
[16:15:46] <dcpurton> I would have thought your main concern is to not have things break during a bisect
[16:16:22] <flatcap> yeah, that's vital

[16:52:18] <dcpurton> Did email address searching recently become case sensitive?
[16:52:34] <dcpurton> That's hopeless unclear
[16:54:52] <flatcap> not that I'm aware of
[16:56:35] <dcpurton> Something is weird
[16:57:15] <flatcap> the case is smart...
[16:57:17] <flatcap> all lower case will match anything
[16:57:34] <flatcap> if you uppercase your search (or part of it), I think it will have to match exactly
[16:57:55] <dcpurton> Maybe not case. If I limit to `~f dcpurton` I get results in the current version in Debian, but not with the version of master I just built
[16:59:25] <dcpurton> I'm sure it wasn't doing this just the other day!
[17:00:53] <flatcap> hmm... your github emails aren't from dcpurton, but notifications@github.com
[17:01:13] <dcpurton> nah - these are just random email in my inbox I sent to myself as tests
[17:01:35] <flatcap> ok
[17:01:55] <dcpurton> <limit> isn't returning anything no matter what I pass to it
[17:02:03] <dcpurton> I shall investigate…
[17:02:34] <flatcap> a quick comparison seems ok, here: 2021-10-29 vs master
[17:03:54] <flatcap> ah, is the result set *empty* or just off-screen?
[17:04:57] <dcpurton> It seems empty
[17:05:22] <dcpurton> can I temporarily build without ccache?
[17:05:51] <flatcap> er, dunno
[17:07:14] * flatcap greps the source
[17:08:03] <flatcap> export CCACHE=none

[17:24:02] <dcpurton> Fix restoring the selected message after limiting
[17:24:08] <dcpurton> which does seem related…
[17:26:00] <flatcap> ah, ok
[17:26:50] <flatcap> and <page-up> didn't reveal anything?
[17:27:18] <flatcap> I didn't expect that commit to affect the limit results
[17:27:46] <dcpurton> Oooo
[17:27:51] <dcpurton> It's a redraw problem
[17:28:47] <flatcap> ah!  everything redraw-y is my fault :-)
[17:29:08] <dcpurton> I need to <page-up> and then <page-down> to see them all
[17:29:19] <flatcap> that's already top of my list
[17:29:33] <flatcap> (when I stop playing around with compose :-)
[17:29:52] <dcpurton> ha
[17:30:07] <dcpurton> that's OK, now I know workaround is ok
[17:30:43] <flatcap> in the old code, if you altered something the code was required to forcibly update other parts of the code...
[17:31:07] <flatcap> the modern replacement is notifications -- which decouples the code
