[22:46:36] <Activ8> ooof push notifications possibly
[22:47:15] <Activ8> Push Notifications, WebXR, and better PWA support coming to iOS
[22:47:21] <xnaas> I pity anyone who makes the mistake of upgrading to the 15.4 dev beta, like I did, though
[22:47:27] <xnaas> PWAs completely broken at the moment, lol
[22:47:36] <Activ8> aw no lol
[22:48:08] <xnaas> So far the dev betas have mostly been ok, but this one...woof. Not so good. üò¨
[22:48:34] <Activ8> Web Push Notifications on iOS. Yes, you read that right, but there is a catch. (wonder what the catch is)
[22:48:57] <xnaas> the catch is they're not actually there yet
[22:49:01] <xnaas> :P
[22:49:19] <xnaas> There's a checkbox to enable them in beta form, but it doesn't actually do anything, yet.
[22:49:35] <xnaas> Somehow I'm sure you'll still need to pay Apple money.
[22:50:50] <Activ8> it might be a paid api or something
[22:53:04] <Activ8> 1- It's a disabled-by-default experiment at this time, 2- The APIs are there, but they are not working
[22:53:41] <xnaas> üëç
[22:54:16] <Activ8> There are some origin-based requirements to use the API that we don't know yet. Maybe we have to register the origin with the Apple Developer Program, similar to the Safari Push Notification program for macOS. If this is the case, the developer will have to pay the annual Apple Developer Program fee to send push messages to their web users.
[22:55:58] <xnaas> Which would require a PR for code no one's gonna write or accept ;P
[22:56:12] <xnaas> (and for hosters to pay Apple $)
[22:56:55] <Activ8> I'm sure for native push notifications yearly subscription that could be paid yearly by donations for the subscription
[22:57:03] <Activ8> 100% 
[22:57:47] <xnaas> I'm seven million percent positive no project maintainer wants to be responsible for push notifications to anyone.
[22:58:42] <MaxLeiter> Apple wont put it behind a pay wall if they add it 
[22:58:49] <MaxLeiter> its a standard, they recognize that 
[22:58:58] <xnaas> They do for macOS. :P
[22:59:03] <Activ8> they did wasn't it this way with macOs
[22:59:48] <xnaas> Apple will do anything to be greedy assholes, they have to. Publicly traded companies ftw.
[23:00:17] <Activ8> what's the difference maintaining this over maintaining the app, there is no difference as long as all maintainers has access and it's super easy to code it
[23:00:27] <xnaas> Don't get me wrong, I want them to do the right thing, but I'm not holding my breath. :P
[23:00:31] <Activ8> maintaining the app subscription
[23:01:58] <Activ8> we shall see
[23:02:46] <xnaas> The Lounge project isn't even in a state where's it's taking donations (unless that started back up again). I don't think it's in any shape to demand/ask for $100/yr from people just so Apple users can have push notifications (if it ends up requiring that). Additionally, if it's protected by an API key, that would mean making the key public which
[23:02:46] <xnaas> would lead to it being abused and shutdown, I'm sure. :P

[23:04:09] <xnaas> For $100/yr, though, you might as well save $50 and pay IRCCloud lol
