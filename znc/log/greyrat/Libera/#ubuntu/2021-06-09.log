[00:11:27] <cbreak> I think?
[00:11:40] <pikapika> cbreak, thats a new thing
[00:11:43] <cbreak> like a radial progress bar
[00:11:45] <pikapika> I always had one or two paused downloads
[00:11:50] <cbreak> well... not a bar. A progress pie chart
[00:11:51] <pikapika> But it didn't change the icon
[00:11:54] <pikapika> I canceled it
[00:11:59] <pikapika> And now its back to the down arrow
[00:12:03] <pikapika> It was a pie chart before
[00:12:13] <pikapika> Which it wasn't even in this partial download stage in the earlier ui
[00:12:19] <cbreak> well, grats, you found your button. It was just cosplaying
[00:12:26] <pikapika> I'll have to investigate how to keep the same Down arrow in both states now
[00:12:31] <pikapika> Goddamn ui designer idiots
[00:12:39] <cbreak> having progress is nice.
[00:13:08] <cbreak> you could enable text labels :D

[00:15:06] <pikapika> Yeah but like its very unintuitve for the downloads icon to change to a completely different thing depending upon state
[00:15:41] <cbreak> might not be intuitive, but it's useful.

[09:32:36] <morgans> new question. is there a way of looking at memory use in my two simms to see if both are active. (when I test with memtest it locks up after 1 second or less. when I test with Dell Diagnostics everything passes.)
[09:35:08] <apb1963> morgans, I'm sure somebody knows better but I don't think linux has such a tool.  Use something like "free" and infer from the results you get.
[09:35:13] <UbuntuUser2005> are you testing it using Ubuntu 20.04 image?
[09:36:00] <morgans> ((side comment: I triend to install xubuntu and it would NOT let me install it in a separate partition. It kept going back to alongside-ubuntu taking up the rest of the partition. And it coldnt not look at all the partitions, the ubuntu one etc. Oh well.))

[09:59:01] <hparadiz> it should say in the readme what version of the kernel it's for

[10:01:15] <LittleBoy> Kernel 2.4 and 2.6 series, tested in Redhat 7.3 or later.
[10:01:45] <hparadiz> yea that's super old
[10:01:46] <LittleBoy> What README_STA_usb says ^^^
[10:01:52] <hparadiz> the current kernel is 5
[10:02:08] <hparadiz> what was the device again?
[10:02:11] <LittleBoy> Yeah, I bought this in 2016 lol, and I think it was old then.  RT5370 chipset.
[10:02:19] <LittleBoy> Ralink RT5370
[10:02:35] <hparadiz> someone made it work for kernel 4 here
[10:02:37] <hparadiz> https://github.com/blahah/ralink_RT5370_linux_driver
[10:02:46] <hparadiz> It might compile on 5 if you're really lucky

[10:04:54] <hparadiz> you can get a wifi 6 chip with  built in kernel 5.x support for like $10 these days
[10:05:11] <hparadiz> might save you a lot of time just doing that
[10:05:28] <LittleBoy> Hmm, that might be the wiser thing to do at this point. Wifi is far, so I need to be able to connect antennas to it.

[21:24:45] <maxFlexGuest> What is your advice for connecting Apple Mac computers running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to the Internet?
[21:25:43] <Mekaneck> as i said... check for Additinal Drivers if Wifi doesn't show up....
[21:26:47] <jplettman> maxFlexGuest: You may have to install Broadcom drivers which involves the fwcutter process. It depends on the hardware you're using, but yeah Mekaneck is right, you basically need to check additional drivers.
[21:27:24] <maxFlexGuest> How can I check for the additional (Broadcom) drivers?
[21:28:06] <Mekaneck> Software & Updates --> Additional Drivers

[23:48:57] <johnjay> question. i want to make a usb bootable drive from the usb installer
[23:49:00] <johnjay> er the cdrom
[23:49:22] <johnjay> but it asks for a source ico image in ubuntu startup creator. does this mean i can't make a usb bootable image from the cdrom live environment?
[23:49:39] *** Quits: cking (~cking@2001:67c:1560:8007::aac:c1d4) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:50:05] <spartanturtle> typically no. but you can download an ISO in that live env and use it with the USB creator
[23:50:19] <johnjay> right ok.
[23:50:32] <johnjay> can i use the ubuntu live cdrom to boot an existing ubuntu install on disk?
[23:51:34] <tomreyn> you can actually run the installer and install a bootable ubuntu with it, on either an installed / fixed storage or removable storage such as a usb key

[23:52:30] <tomreyn> ubuntu startup creator is meant for creating a bootable installer, not a bootable properly installed system,though
[23:53:08] <johnjay> i thought there wasn't a distinction
[23:53:21] <johnjay> i want a usb drive i can use to install ubuntu and if necessary boot into a live environment to fix problems.

[23:53:57] <tomreyn> johnjay: what spartanturtle said applies then
[23:54:13] <johnjay> i see
[23:54:32] <johnjay> what about my second question. i'm trying to boot a usb install on my drive. can i do that from the live cdrom environment?
[23:54:39] <jpmh> am connected to a wireless lan on wlx7c25daecb94a and a raspberry pi on enx8e7fa066f187 (using usb) - I am using dhcpcd to set them up - works pretty well.  Hoevere, when I first connect to the Pi it keeps dropping.  ip a shows no ip address etc and I need to kick dhcpcd .  Eventually all works well and everything stays up.  1) why does it drop, 2) is there a better way to do this?

[23:55:59] <tomreyn> johnjay: hmm, i'm not sure i understand the purpose. maybe start from the very begining: why are you considering these options, what's the overall task you're trying to achieve or problem you're trying to solve?
[23:56:11] <johnjay> i have ubuntu. ubuntu on disk. i want to boot ubuntu from disk
[23:56:26] <johnjay> windows overwrites efi variables. so now i'm trying to find a way to boot ubuntu
[23:56:28] <tomreyn> so power up the system, it should be configured to boot the ubuntu on disk
[23:56:35] <tomreyn> oh ok
[23:56:50] <tomreyn> !grub
[23:56:50] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2

[23:57:50] <apb1963> 20.04; Something is seriously wrong in printerville...  https://snipboard.io/15kYif.jpg  syslog errors: https://pastebin.com/52jFSQck  Printer has been hit or miss for a couple of weeks.  I have exactly one printer.  It keeps getting auto-added randomly under similar, but different names.  It also seems to now auto-delete.  It can't find new printers, but then it shows them.  I pick one, it asks me for the make & model, the
[23:57:51] <apb1963> model is repeated over a dozen times in the list, some identical some with variations.  It's a mess.  Yesterday it worked.  Now it doesn't.  It's all random.
[23:59:25] <johnjay> thanks
