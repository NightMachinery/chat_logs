[00:01:11] <systemfault> The good pattern with DOM, normally, if that you select "once" then keep references to DOM nodes in variables.
[00:01:28] <systemfault> So you don't need to do lookups again.
[00:02:11] <systemfault> For most other operations, you get your nodes in other ways... in event handlers for example
[00:03:06] <austincheney> systemfault, in all fairness you will likely use querySelector more than once and its only 5x faster than querySelectorAll, but its still about 350x slower than the boring static methods.  That's best case performance scenario for query selectors

[01:47:54] <Intelo> blueagain my first langauge on work was java. :)  I stepped back ever since
[01:48:15] <theskillwithin> these js frameworks like react/vue/etc it accomplishes a very important thing,  you can couple your js with the html.  where as before it would be just a ton of spegehtti js code uncoupled from your html

[01:49:44] <theskillwithin> and kind of the same for styles,  you used to have just a giant .css file,  or maybe you organize them better.  but still you'd be afraid to delete any css because you could not guarantee it wouldn't break something
[01:49:54] <Intelo> theskillwithin of course this is a long debate. One also thinks that html semantics are there forever. But react isn't. Sooner or later, something will replace react. That time will be far before that html itself will be replaced by something else.
[01:50:11] * Intelo also thinks that maybe its time to replace html, css, js too for web :)
[01:50:51] <Intelo> theskillwithin I put my styles separatelly in each file besites component file
[01:52:28] <theskillwithin> its very possible react could be replaced someday.  i mean like myspace used to be huge and back then you'd say, no one will ever replace myspace, but then came along fb.  but don't jump ship for the fad of the year, usually react stays at the top
[01:53:08] *** Joins: duuude (~user@user/duuude)
[01:53:22] <systemfault> To replace React, you need something that would solve a problem React cannot.

[02:11:35] <anddam> shouldn't https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#instance_methods list return types for set*() methods?
[02:12:12] <anddam> namely I (a non-javascripter) am trying to write a simple clock page, and I cannot figure why a setDate() is returning a number instead
[02:12:31] <wallbroken> i need to access to an old website which has a broken recaptcha ad i can't do password recovery due to this fault.
[02:12:39] <anddam> well I am technically using ts so the linter complaints about that, but I figure my issue is the use of the language library
[02:12:41] <Decker> what's the result of a set? the previous value?
[02:12:45] <wallbroken> is there an "hack" to make that recaptcha working?
[02:12:54] <Decker> if you set it don't you knwo the value? What' the use in the return?
[02:13:04] <anddam> Decker: I cannot figure that from docs
[02:13:33] <anddam> Decker: well it's a bit of playground for me, I want to evaluate the time difference between next "5th day of the month"
[02:13:43] <Decker> anddam what do you expect it to be?  I'd sort of hope it was the date so you could chain it - but that's probably not the case

[09:15:04] <trafficjam> ok, so as you scroll down, the position of the navbar remains fixed, but the width of the content below the navbar will reduce enough to move to the right side of the navbar?
[09:16:16] <jargon> Yes.
[09:16:46] <jargon> I also need the navbar to scroll at its own pace.

[09:17:42] <jargon> I am not sure how this is doable tho.
[09:18:16] <jargon> If the nav simply scaled to fit that would help.
[09:19:19] <trafficjam> aside from recommending not using the layout in the first place due to not being a very comfortable UI experience, i'm not sure if it's doable with css alone, as i've never actually seen a website use this particular layout before. You might have to use javascript to get it to work. Try asking on the #css channel, maybe they know how to do it with

[09:46:46] <entropy_> question..
[09:46:51] <entropy_> i have a function...
[09:46:53] <entropy_> https://mypastebin.com/PX9rSZuTMVLNMj
[09:47:31] <entropy_> i want to remove the ending "0" -> 1.30KB
[09:47:37] <entropy_> to be 1.3KB
[09:48:01] <jargon> entropy_ ghah, used x.xxxKiB
[09:48:12] <jargon> entropy_ ghah, use* x.xxxKiB
[09:48:28] <jargon> KiB works, x.xxxKB doesn’t compute.
[09:48:45] <jargon> trust me.,
[09:49:30] <jargon> You do not want your code involved in power of twos using decimals.
[09:49:47] <jargon> KiB is base 1000, not 1024.
[09:50:07] <jargon> Nobody uses powers of 1024 anymore,
[09:50:38] <jargon> entropy_, didn’t you like, go to jail in the pasT?
[09:50:58] <entropy_> no
[09:51:18] <jargon> So you weren’t involved in LulzSec?

[09:52:11] <jargon> Ok. :P
[09:53:25] <jargon> If you use base 1024 and attempt to calculate decimals, they could go out expadning indefinitely.
[09:54:21] <jargon> xB is powers of 1024, xIB is powers of 1000.
[09:54:43] <jargon> xiB rather.

[10:20:34] <trafficjam> if you're giving the exact same input, it shouldn't be rounding for one and not the other
[10:21:18] <trafficjam> but honestly i would just use a library for this rather than writing it yourself (unless you want to for whatever reason)

[10:30:58] <jargon> entropy_ originally stated that they wanted to have no trailing zeros, then claimed they wanted uniform decimal places.

[12:00:45] <blahboybaz> What doesn't make sense though is that all the numbers going into the sum are max two decimal places (what you would consider an even amount at two decimal places).

[12:17:34] <jargon> decimal places in magnitudes of 1024 do not properly compute.

[18:17:57] <ThePendulum> I think if you set div.pos it would only exist on that representation of the element, not on the actual element, so you need to pass that reference around and can't query it from the DOM with that data. double checking though

[18:19:21] <fweht> but i keep the references anyway, but you are right, its no a big deal to instead use an object with a `node` and a `pos` property, i was just curious
[18:19:28] <ThePendulum> what you could do is write a data attribute to the actual html element like <div data-x="240"> but that wouldn't be my favorite solution
[18:20:09] <ThePendulum> right yeah I would separate the moving data from the dom

[19:26:10] <fweht> if i have a parent div with 20 child divs and i want to animate the parents translation and the childrens scale, is it easier for the browser if i set translation and scale on each child individually, or if i set translation to the parent and only scales to the children?
[19:27:49] <ThePendulum> I think I would set it on the parent and let the browser work out any optimizations
