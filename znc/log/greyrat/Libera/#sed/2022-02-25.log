[00:13:23] <saint_> hi all  - i have a csv file , where a column with phone number is like aaabbbcccc ... i am trying to change this to 91aaabbbcccc. tried sed s/([0-9]{10})/91\1/ but it's not working. any help appreciated :)
[00:20:53] <Soliton> sed uses basic regex by default but you wrote extended regex. your sed probably has a -E switch to enable extended regex.
[00:21:39] <emanuele6> which column is the one with the phone number?
[00:22:45] <emanuele6> first? fifth? second? last? third?
[00:22:48] <saint_> 4th
[00:23:03] <emanuele6> s/^\([,]*,)\{3\}/&91/
[00:23:27] <saint_> ha. -E did the trick, thanks a ton
[00:24:05] <saint_> i did sed -E 's/([0-9]{10})/91\1/'
[00:24:09] <emanuele6> s/\([0-9]\{10\}\)/91\1/   would also have worked without -E.
[00:24:44] <emanuele6> either way, if the goal is to prepend 91 to the fourth column, why don't you use code that does that?
[00:24:56] <saint_> because sometimes it can be 5th column
[00:25:03] <saint_> but the number is always 10 digits
[00:25:06] <emanuele6> but you said fourth :/
[00:25:09] <saint_> it's the only 10 digits numbers
[00:25:23] <saint_> i said 4th, but i know this guy sending me the files is oging to add a surprise down the road
[00:25:49] <saint_> makes more sense to catch 10 digits numbers if i know this will always be the number, regardeless of its position, rather than working on a position which might change down the road
[00:25:58] <emanuele6> s/([0-9]{10})/91\1/ places 91 in front of the first sequence of 10 or more [0-9] characters it can't find
[00:26:03] <emanuele6> s/can't/can/
[00:26:12] <saint_> on the other hand, some numebrs are 123-123-1234 ... if i do a sed s/-// , it only removes the first -
[00:26:41] <saint_> oh, so sed does the first sequence it finds.. 
[00:27:14] <emanuele6> the implied flag argument is 1.
[00:27:22] <emanuele6> which means replace the first occurence
[00:27:52] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x,y,z' | sed 's/,/&HI/2'
[00:27:53] <shbot> emanuele6: hi,hello,HIx,y,z
[00:28:03] <emanuele6> if you pass a 2, it replaces the second
[00:28:06] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x,y,z' | sed 's/,/&HI/4'
[00:28:08] <shbot> emanuele6: hi,hello,x,y,HIz
[00:28:15] <emanuele6> if you pass a 4, it replaces the fourth
[00:28:17] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x,y,z' | sed 's/,/&HI/1'
[00:28:19] <shbot> emanuele6: hi,HIhello,x,y,z
[00:28:22] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x,y,z' | sed 's/,/&HI/'
[00:28:23] <shbot> emanuele6: hi,HIhello,x,y,z
[00:28:39] <emanuele6> 1 and omitted flags are the same
[00:28:48] <saint_> i thought the \1 meant the first group as per if i had multiple groups (aa)(vv)(xx)
[00:28:49] <emanuele6> and mean "replace the first occurence"
[00:29:09] <emanuele6> yes, \1 is the capture of the first group.
[00:29:15] <emanuele6> that is another thing.
[00:29:28] <emanuele6> not sure where you see \1 or similar in  's/,/&HI/1'
[00:29:36] <saint_> so confusing . is the FAQ URL mentioned in the title of this chan the best way to read and learn about it ? 
[00:30:05] <emanuele6> what were you trying to do? why is "oh, so sed does the first sequence it finds.." a problem?
[00:30:12] *** Quits: Mehavoid (~XXX@176.192.151.214) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:30:32] <saint_> its not a problem. its a misunderstanding from my part. 
[00:30:48] <emanuele6> what was your original understanding then?
[00:31:18] <saint_> that the 1, 2, 3 represent a group of characters being caught with (xxx)
[00:31:25] <saint_> for each new set of ( ) is a new group
[00:31:30] <emanuele6> those are \1 \2 \3
[00:31:31] <saint_> that s what i understood
[00:31:33] <emanuele6> they are another thing
[00:31:45] <emanuele6> why do think that s/,/&HI/1 is the same?
[00:31:49] <emanuele6> there is no \ there
[00:32:07] <saint_> i did not, i did not pay attention. calm down young jedi.. i m going to read more doc. thanks for the help. 
[00:32:17] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x1,y2,z3' | sed 's/,\(.\)\(.\)/\2HI\1/2'
[00:32:19] <shbot> emanuele6: hi,hello1HIx,y2,z3
[00:32:35] <emanuele6> here, i used \1 \2 and the 2 flag in combination
[00:32:40] <Soliton> the syntax is s/regex/replacement/flags
[00:32:43] <emanuele6> they are different things
[00:32:49] <Soliton> all 3 parts have different syntax.
[00:34:11] <emanuele6> that found matches for `,\(.\)\(.\)' (so `,' followed by at least two characters)
[00:34:27] <saint_> Soliton i just found out that the replacement only works for the first occurence found. 
[00:34:34] <emanuele6> selected the `2' match:   hi,hello  ->,<-  x1,y2,z3
[00:34:44] <emanuele6> err
[00:34:46] <saint_> Soliton i though it would find any occurence in a given string
[00:34:53] <emanuele6> selected the `2'nd match:   hi,hello  ->,x1<-  ,y2,z3
[00:35:03] <Soliton> saint_: you can use the g flag for that.
[00:35:15] <emanuele6> while doing so, it captured "x" into \1 and "1" into \2
[00:35:22] <saint_> Soliton jesus, freaking awesome. thanks a ton . 
[00:35:28] <saint_> just tried and it works like a charm
[00:36:04] <emanuele6> and then it replaced that match ",x1" with  `\2HI\1', so the value of \2 "1" followed by "HI" followed by the value of \1 "x"
[00:36:12] <emanuele6> hi,hello  ->,x1<-  ,y2,z3
[00:36:19] <emanuele6> hi,hello  ->1HIx<-  ,y2,z3
[00:36:24] <emanuele6> hi,hello1HIx,y2,z3
[00:36:33] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x1,y2,z3' | sed 's/,\(.\)\(.\)/\2HI\1/2'
[00:36:34] <shbot> emanuele6: hi,hello1HIx,y2,z3
[00:40:53] <emanuele6> the matches for  `,\(.\)\(.\)'  were 4:    hi  ->,he<-  llo  ->,x1<-  ->,y2<-  ->,z3<- 
[00:41:29] <emanuele6> /2 told the s/// command to only replace the second one: ->,x1<-
[00:42:07] <emanuele6> /1 (which is what is assumed if you don't specify anything) would have told the s/// command to only replace the first one: ->,he<-
[00:42:14] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x1,y2,z3' | sed 's/,\(.\)\(.\)/\2HI\1/'
[00:42:15] <shbot> emanuele6: hieHIhllo,x1,y2,z3
[00:42:33] <emanuele6> and then you can use /g to replace "globally", so all the original matches
[00:42:36] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hi,hello,x1,y2,z3' | sed 's/,\(.\)\(.\)/\2HI\1/g'
[00:42:37] <shbot> emanuele6: hieHIhllo1HIx2HIy3HIz
