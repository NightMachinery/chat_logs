[19:47:02] <renaud> when trying to connect to the mail server for @pangloss.be, I get an error with TLS: 5672967237832:error:1404C10B:SSL routines:ST_OK:wrong version number:/usr/src/lib/libssl/ssl_pkt.c:378:
[19:47:45] <renaud> the site https://ssl-tools.net/mailservers/pangloss.be confirms there is an issue with pangloss.be
[19:48:13] <renaud> however, I would have expected opensmtpd to retry without TLS instead of disabling the route

[20:30:18] <lapinot> hi folks, i recently set up opensmtpd for personal use with friends and would like to create some "trash email" functionality, where email rcpt-to matching eg "trash01.*@foo.com" will get redirected to some fixed mailbox but i'd like to keep the original target in a mail header. Do you think it's possible to do with a filter using a combination of rewriting on phase 'rcpt-to' and inserting a
[20:30:20] <lapinot> header on phase 'data-line'? Or should i do it in a completely other way? (perhaps it's better to do it later in dovecot?)
[20:31:50] <lapinot> i forgot to add that there should be several prefix redirecting to different mailboxes (eg one trash prefix per user)
