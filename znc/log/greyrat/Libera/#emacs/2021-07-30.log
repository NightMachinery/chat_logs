[01:18:25] <lispmacs[work]> hi, using Emacs terminal (M-x term) and I need to send "C-a C-x" to the shell. But I can't figure out how to prevent emacs from interception the C-x
[01:18:37] <lispmacs[work]> 27.2
[01:20:18] <hoppity> Is there a way to use a "real shell" on emacs namely something like behaves exactly like my gnome terminal but where I can still use Emacs commands?
[01:20:27] *** Joins: slowButPresent (~slowButPr@user/slowbutpresent)
[01:20:59] <lispmacs[work]> hoppity: M-x term is pretty similar, I think
[01:21:09] <technomancy> hoppity: a real shell doesn't work like gnome terminal
[01:21:15] <technomancy> but a real terminal might =)
[01:21:37] <technomancy> vterm is the closest thing to what you're describing, but it's not a shell
[01:23:32] <lispmacs[work]> I'm confused because the documentation states that C-c is the only control character intercepted while in the char mode in term
[01:23:37] <hoppity> I did M-x term but then I get stuck in it and cant get out
[01:23:40] <lispmacs[work]> but C-x is also getting captured
[01:23:45] <hoppity> How can I still execute emacs comand while in term?
[01:23:48] <lispmacs[work]> hoppity: C-c o or C-c b
[01:24:12] <hoppity> thank you, testing now
[01:24:30] <lispmacs[work]> sorry, C-c b doesn't work on my emacs
[01:24:43] <lispmacs[work]> C-c o should take you to another window, if you have one open

[01:24:57] <hoppity> also, ic you are using C-c as M-x while in term, how do you actually kill processes?
[01:24:58] <lispmacs[work]> you can also call C-c C-j to make term go to line mode
[01:25:05] <hoppity> Normally you use Ctrl+C for that
[01:25:11] <lispmacs[work]> C-c C-c
[01:25:56] <hoppity> hmm, that's strange
[01:26:00] <hoppity> let me test it out
[01:26:35] <hoppity> also, the emacs term does not seem to have tab completion, is this normal?

[05:40:58] <yrk> dragestil: I can play around with emms-history and see if I can make it do that. I personally don't use emms-history. when I restart emacs (about once a month), I rebuild all of my playlists
[05:41:41] <dragestil> yrk: ok thanks. how do you rebuild you playlists, by loading playlist files?
[05:42:42] <dragestil> yrk: lucky you, my gnu/linux distro does not support live patch, so every time the kernel gets updated I have to reboot the system. could only dream of a month-long emacs instance :)
[05:43:44] <yrk> dragestil: I iterate with mapc over a bunch of conses like (("music Classical" . "/home/yrk/audio/classical/") ... ("music Jazz" .

[06:38:34] <oats> alphapapa[m], I'm watching the development of ement with great interest :)
[06:39:01] <oats> the way sending messages works is... different :P
[06:39:08] <alphapapa[m]> oats: I just added some new features and fixes today :)  You can upload images now
[06:39:35] <alphapapa[m]> oats: You mean typing in the minibuffer?  Yeah, I felt like that's more "emacsy" than typing at the bottom of a buffer.  And it gives some features for free, like history, etc.
[06:39:52] <alphapapa[m]> (Sorry, forgot this was the libera room and I'm not supposed to send replies.)
[06:40:13] <oats> what?
[06:40:17] <pjb> Why not?
[06:40:19] <oats> also, I guess I'm just used to circe
[06:40:35] <alphapapa[m]> I was told that the bridge doesn't format them correctly, so it was looking annoying to the room.  Is that not the case anymore?
[06:40:38] <oats> and I'm used to circe because I was used to weechat :P

[06:41:35] <alphapapa[m]> I also added some more IRC-like formatting options, so you can do it like "[21:11:00] alphapapa> Oh, good, maybe it's working now."  if you prefer that style

[06:42:12] <alphapapa[m]> oats: #emacs:libera.chat
[06:42:23] <oats> Ideally I guess I'd like to make ement as circe-like as possible hehe

[06:43:12] *** Joins: moats (~oats@user/oats)
[06:43:45] <alphapapa[m]> One of my favorite new features is that you can press SPC in a room to read it, then when it hits the end of the buffer and you press SPC again, it buries the buffer and goes to the next unread room, so you can just mash SPC to read all unread buffers and then end up back at the room list buffer.

[06:46:14] <alphapapa[m]> Also, by using the minibuffer for input, you can send replies to messages further up in the buffer, even when you can't see the end of the buffer, without losing your place in the buffer.

[06:46:36] <oats> nifty

[07:22:39] <alphapapa[m]> I just did a little benchmarking, and it seems that, when looking up in an alist, it's faster to concat a string and intern it and look it up with eq as the test function, than to use string= as the test function with a string that's already been concatted.  I'm a little bit surprised.

[07:50:49] <aidalgol> Hmm... I'd try asking a spacemacs-specific forum/channel.
[07:50:58] <hyiltiz> yup; but I am not brave enough to `emacs -q` yet; I still need help for evil noobs

[07:51:22] <hyiltiz> at some day, I'll just run emacs vanilla with minimal config
[07:51:34] <hyiltiz> spacemacs threw me into deep holes more than it helped tbh
[07:51:39] <aidalgol> We have some spacemacs users in here, but for something this fundamental breaking, I'd want to go to a spacemacs community for help.
[07:51:42] <alphapapa[m]> hyiltiz: See my emacs-sandbox.sh to make it easier to test alternative configs
[07:52:07] <aidalgol> hyiltiz: re. -q, I think alphapapa[m] was joking.  -q is just for ruling out your config causing bugs.  You don't use it normally.
[07:52:09] <hyiltiz> I can run `emacs --with-profile doom/vanilla` etc.

[07:52:24] <hyiltiz> -q is fine ie emacs is fine
[07:52:26] <hyiltiz> even doom is fine
[07:52:40] <aidalgol> Maybe use doom instead of spacemacs?
[07:52:42] <hyiltiz> so it could as well be spacemacs breaking again :( sorry for the noise I'll go elsewhere
[07:53:36] <hyiltiz> yeah doom seems much better maintained and designed but I didn't make the switch last time I tried it was lacking a few key binding and tweaks I'd rather not do myself (mostly org and pdf related)
[07:53:55] <hyiltiz> anyway Ill go to spacemacs and let u all k what it is (if anyone is interested to find out that is)
[07:54:13] <aidalgol> If you need help switching to vanilla, you'll get plenty of help in here.
[07:54:24] <aidalgol> Especially if it's mainly keybindings tripping you up.

[07:56:12] <hyiltiz> yeah for keybindings I think just setting up and maitaining that config consistent across packages seem a lot of work to do myself, tho I know how
[07:56:39] <hyiltiz> and I never found a comfortable folding mode for emacs that works as well or better than vim...
[07:56:44] <hyiltiz> that is pretty low bar tho
[07:56:53] <aidalgol> I've only ever used vanilla Emacs, but most of my custom keybindings I just set once and then never have to change.

[08:07:12] <aidalgol> hyiltiz: That's taken care of with the zfs-auto-snapshot cron job.

[08:08:53] <hyiltiz> i tried out btrfs and wasn't quite impressed either
[08:09:12] <aidalgol> Well the way ZFS works, it can't really get into an inconsistent state like more conventional filesystems can.

[12:11:03] <wasamasa> that's how payment processors work
[12:11:45] <wasamasa> micropayments are about convincing someone to pay a sensible amount, then treating it like a virtual credit balance
[12:12:00] <wasamasa> like, buy 100 coins for 50$, then spend a few coins here and there
[12:12:24] <wasamasa> or do a bookmarking trick where you do several donations and pay for the monthly equivalent all at once
[12:12:47] <codingquark> I receive money as merchant sometimes. Depending on platform, they take ~10%. But most merchants offload the fees to the customer
[12:12:50] <wasamasa> so instead of immediately withdrawing 1$ 20 times, you withdraw 20$ instead
[12:13:23] <wasamasa> that's on the customer side though, I've yet to experience it on the merchant side

[13:45:28] <dokma> If I go exit and open eshell again it is already connected to remote machine again
[13:46:43] <stm> I think eshell opens in whatever directory is current in the buffer when you start it. Can you select a buffer that is local before you start eshell?

[13:47:34] <dokma> stm: you're correct. Still... how do I tell eshell to disconnect from remote?
[13:47:59] <dokma> It's rather silly to close eshell, go find a local buffer and open it from there.
[13:48:10] <landgraf> stupid question: how to run emacs on second monitor? I've enabled exwm-randr and configured it. now second (external) monitor is empty (with cursor only). How to "send" buffer there?

[13:49:24] <kilobug> dokma: eshell is just emacs-lisp code not a "real" shell, so it's not like it's really connected to the remote host, it just operates on your tramp path like any other Emacs code would, and you can just "cd" away from it

[16:37:33] <ville> howdy. how do i find out what face is being used to draw text on a particular part of modeline?
[16:38:26] <rdbeni0> hi all, i would like to convert org > <something, for example pdf> , but i would like to use pandoc/latext engine. where can i insert these options: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex
[16:38:48] <rdbeni0> for example i would like to use geometry engine for latex
[16:41:17] <rdbeni0> ah i see, it would be directly in the cli as -V  : https://jdhao.github.io/2019/05/30/markdown2pdf_pandoc/

[16:43:03] <kilobug> rdbeni0: there is a built-in org => latex export, IIRC you can define in your .emacs LaTeX "classes" and then specify in the org file which "class" to use; class is like the whole preambule of the document, so you can include custom packges, geometry options, babel, ...

[16:46:45] <Viking667> I've got a little dired question to ask... I'm trying to replace instances of " an <something>" where the <something> can vary, but doesn't start with a vowel, a semi-vowel or x. How do I provide a suitable replacement string? The first bit's easy:   replace an with a. But it's the next bit that has me puzzled.

[18:26:30] <gganley> I did some quick searching but didn't come up with anything concrete
[18:27:22] <pjb> gganley: you can definitely.

[18:28:03] <gganley> pjb: any idea of where to start? I've seen initial-frame-alist but not sure yet
[18:28:04] <pjb> you can use set-frame-position or move-frame
[18:28:25] <pjb> set-frame-position and set-frame-width, or move-frame.

[18:29:52] <pjb> gganley: well, the default behavior of macOS is not really nice.  I prefer my frames to be positionned at fixed position.  Eg I've got 1/3 of the screen on the left with a safari-youtube, and either 2/3 on the right, for emacs, or sometimes 2 1/3 windows.
[18:30:26] <pjb> gganley: this positionning is performed by cocoa, but AFAIK, emacs will prevent it.  So you'd have to re-implement it in lisp with the mentionned functions.
[18:31:26] <pjb> gganley: for example, you could have a function on before-make-frame-hook that would compute the new default frame position (eg. counting the existing frames, and/or checking their position).
[18:32:01] <pjb> and storing it in initial-frame-alist

[18:36:40] <Bayes> got it, that's my next thing in my learnlog
[18:36:49] <grym> it's a little fussy on macOS, though 
[18:37:07] <rpav> Bayes: if you have weird font issues with --daemon, lemme know i'll pastebin you some code 
[18:37:23] <rpav> you also don't _need_ --daemon for emacs-server, but it can be handy
[18:37:27] <pjb> gganley: for example, something like this: https://termbin.com/mfocw
[18:37:49] <rpav> we also figured out how to get the value for configuration switching if you want to e.g. `emacs --daemon=erc` for multiple servers
[18:38:28] <pjb> gganley: well, wait for the next version, I confused several ideas.
[18:38:31] <rpav> (e.g. you want a separate emacs for erc which doesn't load everything, and also doesn't get disconnected because some operation like package-refresh takes too long)

[18:58:00] <faceface> I've hit a problem I don't know how to debug... I'm using ESS with TRAMP, as described here: http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#index-tramp-support. When I first start R with M-x R, I get the remote session as described, but subsequently, if I kill and restart the R process, it starts locally
[18:58:21] <faceface> It's not a major problem, but confusing and annoying trying to debug this exec-path issue
[18:58:32] <pjb> There's no occurence of cascadeTopLeft in 27.2 sources…
[18:59:04] <pjb> faceface: sorry, I didn't see you were using tramp.
[18:59:23] <faceface> pjb: I think the exec-path should still work though
[18:59:34] <pjb> I doubt it.  
[18:59:44] <pjb> exec-path is PATH in a lisp list.
[18:59:53] <pjb> for local exec.
[19:00:01] <pjb> The PATH for a remote host will have to be different.
[19:00:28] <faceface> pjb: but I am seeing the PATH on the remote
[19:00:38] <faceface> when I describe exec-path
[19:00:40] <pjb> But the problem is rather that M-x R doesn't take into account the fact that the current buffer is a tramp buffer.  This is done by a few modes, to run commands remotely.
[19:01:08] <faceface> pjb: it does on the first invocation, but not subsequently
[19:01:13] <pjb> faceface: you can store anything in the PATH/exec-path, the question is whether it's sent to TRAMP to be used on the remote host. It would be meaningless to do that.

[19:04:10] <pjb> faceface: I cannot test it, and I don't have R; have a look at its sources, and see if there's a variant to launch it for a remote session.  Perhaps something like R-remote or start-R with a host argument?  Then perhaps using this alternative command would help in this case?
[19:04:33] <pjb> faceface: if you type C-x C-f instead of M-x R you should see the tramp path prefilled.

[19:06:11] <faceface> but by then, R is started, so me changing it has no effect

[19:14:25] <pjb> faceface: that's because when you kill it, the buffer that is left is not a remote buffer ("tramp buffer").

[20:16:00] <twb> (You can do "firefox -P" again to revert this)

[20:17:26] <twb> if profile doens't fix it, the next most likely problem is sockt communication between the new firefox (client) and the alrady-running firefox (server)

[20:38:06] <dale> twb: Huh, FYI Firefox is unhappy about TLS on that server.  Apparently it doesn't support TLS >= 1.2, if Firefox is to be believed.
[20:38:25] <twb> dale: that server doesn't run the same content on http and https

[20:39:13] <johnjay> tell me if i'm crazy but does doing ctrl-T in firefox bring up a new tab with lots of search suggestions?

[20:40:01] <twb> dale: well ALSO #1 there

[20:40:47] <dale> twb: Do you know what EASE expands to?  Searching "TLS EASE" is not being helpful.
[20:40:54] <johnjay> if i create a new tab to write a new address i don't really want to see something new, so duplicating the current is the most visually minimalist thing to do
[20:41:00] <johnjay> the problem in chrome is that it has "smooth scrolling"
[20:41:03] <twb> dale: are you using https everywhere?
[20:41:12] <johnjay> so if you duplicae the current tab it will 'smoothly scroll' to where you were over a second
[20:41:19] <twb> I mean the EFF webext
[20:41:38] <dale> twb: Oh, I am, I actually thought I uninstalled that.  Doesn't Firefox (I'm running beta) now offer the "force all to be HTTPS by default" option itself?

[21:22:57] <twb> technomancy: is pipewire basically "let's fix pulseaudio" ?
[21:22:58] <dale> aniketgm: It just seems longer and much more complicated than typing "magenta" twice. :)
[21:23:10] <twb> technomancy: does it still run on top of alsa, so literally running TWO separate sound stacks
[21:23:18] <dale> aniketgm: You could even move the two keywords that share a color next to each other to make it easy to see they share a color.
[21:23:23] <mentat> So, I'm trying to write a macro that just basically maps over a list of things and returns the list of expressions. I know I can do it with dolist (and I have written it), but it's bugging me that this solution isn't right. For some reason the splice doesn't work the way I think it should.

[21:41:32] <mentat> vterm is great
[21:41:41] <twb> vterm isn't a shell
[21:41:48] <twb> nor is term
[21:41:53] <twb> those are terminal emulators
[21:42:28] <twb> and yes, if you have the libraries, you should be using libvterm for speed reasons
[21:42:47] <hoppity> what is the difference between a shell and a terminal emulator? I always used the term interchanegably

[23:42:15] <dale> mentat: I guess technically your last example isn't a recursive macro just because the macro generates its code and then returns, the macro never calls itself.  Instead, the lisp interpreter expands your macro, then expands another instance of it, and so on.
[23:42:46] <dale> mentat: But maybe it's a matter of terminology.
[23:45:58] <mentat> dale: I mean what else would a recursive macro be? Would the macro code have to call itself directly without printing an intermediate form? Can you think of a situation where that would give you any benefit over relying on repeated expansions?
[23:46:29] <rpav> same as any case where you want to do something recursively presumably
