[02:22:15] <Elw3> If i do local x=nil and later x=true would the later still be local or will it be garbage collected?
[02:23:31] <caoliver> It will be local if still in you're still in the same scope.  It is the old value that is garbage collected.
[02:24:26] <caoliver> Likewise, if the value in a local var is not otherwise referenced, it will get collected after it goes out of scope.
[02:24:29] *** Parts: acheam (~acheam@kisslinux/acheam) ()
[02:25:46] <caoliver> Unless you force a GC, you can't rely on when that happens.  GC is about the illusion of infinite memory; it's not about explicit resource reclamation.
[02:26:26] <Elw3> So wait if i do a gc within that scope x may be a global?
[02:29:03] <caoliver> If you're at a point in the chunk where you've not seen local foo, then foo refers to a global.
[02:30:19] <caoliver> If you see local foo, then it is subsequently local and shadows the global.  A subsequent local foo shadows the previous local foo.
[02:30:30] * caoliver has been bitten by that last one.
[02:31:29] <Elw3> Glad i only ask out of interest, so far i managed to keep the scopes clean enough.
[02:31:49] *** Quits: Lone_Wolf (~Lone_Wolf@user/lone-wolf/x-8969871) (Quit: quitters always win and winners always quit)
[02:31:55] <caoliver> If you call collectgarbage() within that scope, the value is still referred to by the name.  The value will be left alone.
[02:32:55] <caoliver> Basically, if something can be reached transitively via globals or variables in scope, gc won't touch it.
[02:34:34] <caoliver> Exceptions being values reachable only via weak tables.  See the weak table docs for the explicit rules here.
[02:37:35] <RhodiumToad> always worth remembering that weak tables also provide the only way to access an object _after_ its __gc metamethod was called, assuming the __gc metamethod doesn't itself store any reference to the object
[02:39:48] <RhodiumToad> (the fact that this is possible at all means that for userdata __gc metamethods, you have to be careful to leave the object in a safe state)
[03:01:03] <furq> nil and true won't be garbage collected ever
[03:05:42] <RhodiumToad> well obviously

[03:28:26] <svm_invictvs> caoliver, heh. Do you remember the old boxed software that would claim to give you more RAM by installing a program on your computer?
[03:30:55] <Elw3> The shocking news is that they worked.
[03:32:19] <caoliver> I never saw that ad in the flesh, but I saw a YouTube about that fraud maybe a couple of years ago.
[03:33:39] <caoliver> That may be the root of the "Download some RAM" jokes from my early i'net days.
[03:33:53] * caoliver ran an ISP from 1994 to 1999.
[03:35:24] * caoliver needs to make some coffee and start some lentil/grain porridge.
[03:35:47] <RhodiumToad> ah, the bad old days of extended vs. expanded memory
[03:35:51] <svm_invictvs> caoliver, How did they work?
[03:35:58] <svm_invictvs> er Elw3 
[03:36:42] <svm_invictvs> Also did anyone else know about sylvanaar?
[03:36:49] <svm_invictvs> Am I like literally the last person to know?
[03:37:10] <RhodiumToad> I guess many of us don't do WoW?
[03:37:12] <caoliver> RhodiumToad, I never dealt with the rudeness of DOS real mode addressing.  I went directly from Suns (school) to a 486 running an early Linux (Slackware).
[03:37:26] <RhodiumToad> lucky you
[03:37:38] <Elw3> I always guessed it was an early zram plugin.
[03:37:52] <svm_invictvs> RhodiumToad, He was a regular member of the channel here, right?
[03:38:56] <caoliver> My Lua use is strictly Linux system/utility hackery.  I know nothing of game uses.
[03:39:12] <svm_invictvs> RhodiumToad, He wrote the IDE plugins for Lua, too
[03:39:22] <svm_invictvs> And a debugger
[03:39:43] <RhodiumToad> my logs show him regularly joining the channel but not saying anything since June 2020
[03:39:49] <svm_invictvs> Yeah
[03:39:56] <caoliver> Actually I have a drive from a salvaged box with a bunch of games and a boatload of nasty Lua scripts.
[03:39:58] <svm_invictvs> Well I remember speaking to him quite a bit.
[03:40:21] <svm_invictvs> And I actually spoke to him on the phone a few times. We wanted to hire him to build some lua stuf finto our product that uses lua but long story short we dind't have the budget.
[03:40:29] * caoliver thinks that someone might say the same about his Lua code.
[03:41:08] <caoliver> SO it's a personal connection for you.  I wouldn't have known him from Adam.
[03:41:15] <svm_invictvs> RhodiumToad, Just sad, that's all.
[03:41:25] <RhodiumToad> death always is
[03:42:14] <svm_invictvs> Yeah
[03:42:40] <svm_invictvs> Especially when its' someone we "know"
[03:42:54] <caoliver> That depends.  My father suffered from stage 4 lung cancer, so his death was relief.
[03:43:36] <svm_invictvs> Man, that must have been hard.
[03:43:36] <caoliver> There is suffering of a degree that death is preferable.
[03:43:41] <caoliver> It was.
[03:44:36] <caoliver> The Vacuum left is always an ugly thing, but sometimes it's the less ugly thing given the alternatives.
[03:44:40] <svm_invictvs> I hope to die in a shipwreck if I had my choice :P
[03:44:48] <svm_invictvs> caoliver, yeah I hear ya
[03:45:26] <caoliver> I lost a dog to hemangiosarcoma.  (Blood vessel cancer.  Immediate bleed out after a normal existence.)
[03:47:02] <caoliver> So it wasn't protracted death.  That's what I'd like to avoid.  Perhaps we should type about less morose things though.  ;-)

[04:32:58] <caoliver> While I may never exhaust the pile of things I'd like to accomplish, I'm more than accepting of my finiteness.
[04:33:29] <caoliver> There is something somewhat depraved about seeking immortality when humans are still making new humans.
[04:34:06] <RhodiumToad> there are arguments on both sides of that but they probably aren't appropriate here
[04:34:50] <Elw3> Isnt that a goal humanity should aim for? Stop breeding, become immortal.
[04:34:54] <RhodiumToad> no
[04:35:27] <Elw3> What goal should it go for then?
[04:35:41] <RhodiumToad> that is a very good question
[04:36:19] <caoliver> The problem you need to address it to see your finiteness as a good thing rather than bad.
[04:36:32] <caoliver> s/it to/is to/
[04:36:47] <RhodiumToad> that's too simplistic a position.
[04:37:14] <Elw3> But i want to live to improve myself. The more time i have the more awesome i can get.
[04:38:51] <caoliver> That is very self centered.
[04:39:07] <RhodiumToad> how far can you improve yourself? if everyone were immortal, how would you prevent stagnation?
[04:39:36] <Elw3> Obviously i do not care about other ppl.
[04:39:55] <caoliver> That *is* a problem.
[04:40:22] <Elw3> Humanity is fucked up, if you start caring a bit it will make you sick.
[04:40:46] <caoliver> I'm thinking I need to ignore someone.
[04:40:52] <RhodiumToad> in many cases, progress (whether in science or society) has required waiting for people to die off
[04:40:53] * caoliver grumbles
[04:41:23] <caoliver> If you stop caring, you can make many others sick.
[04:41:49] <Elw3> Ah yes, the old line, a new theory succeeds not because it is good but because the believers of the old die out.
[04:42:14] <RhodiumToad> it's not always how it works, but it does happen
[04:42:26] * caoliver has no room for narcissistic self indulgence.
[04:43:20] * caoliver is more of a Popperian when it comes to theory.
[04:43:22] <Elw3> Whats your point caoliver? Lets say ill give you 1 million bucks, what will you do with it?
[04:43:55] <caoliver> I don't see the point of this conversation.  I'd rather enjoy my coffee and prepare dinner.
[04:44:09] <Elw3> I bet you will not drive up to afrika to feed starving childs, and if you dont, can i call you narcisstic?
[04:44:26] <caoliver> Plonk!

[19:49:18] <svm_invictvs> I'm getting a segmentation fault in lua_gettop I'm trying to figure out what may be causing that. The lua_state being 0? 
[19:49:47] <svm_invictvs> top and func are just integers or pointers correct?

[20:57:38] <caoliver> The only thing I can think of is the state pointer you're passing to lua_gettop() is bogus.
