[00:16:42] <Thursday> Guys, what's the best cross-platform way to move/copy files in a local network? And some user-friendly way to set up some program on my Archlinux and family's Android phones and their WiNdOwS computers to not to listen another mother's rant about full phone memory
[00:17:23] <MrElendig> Thursday: a nas
[00:17:49] <MrElendig> both for traditinal storage + something like nextcloud
[00:17:56] <bonob> syncthing is great for synchronizing files across devices

[00:20:27] <Thursday> well ok I can set up some samba in a local net but I look smth more normie-friendly for my mother. To click a button and send shit to pc. Personally I use scp for these tasks. MrElendig: nextcloud is too bloated for simple file transfer task IMO. bonob: syncthing is great, but it's for synchronizimg more, to move files with deletion on one device and keeping on another i should manually edic
[00:20:30] <Thursday> configs for every folder. Again, it should be application for my mother primarly.
[00:22:25] <Thursday> I'd set up unison cus it's great software, but there is no android clients for unison :/
[00:22:52] <alad> bonob: do you have an empty /etc/hosts by chance
[00:23:17] <MrElendig> Thursday: right click .> share folder not easy enough?
[00:23:33] <MrElendig> or just tell her to copy the file into the dir named "Shared"
[00:23:59] <bonob> alad: I have localhost definitions in /etc/hosts
[00:24:02] <Thursday> >right click
[00:24:12] <MrElendig> even my mother manages to use samba

[02:11:16] <zillex> Hi! I have a problem... I don't seem to be able to set my journalctl to be persistent. I have tried configuring the journald.conf to have 'Storage=persistent' but that does not work, it would be useful to have it persistent because I am trying to find out what causes a crash, and I cant do that (for obvious reasons) if my logs are saved on my ram.
[02:11:45] <MrElendig> it is persistent by default
[02:11:57] <MrElendig> but if the machine crashes some info might be lost due to buffering
[02:12:05] <MrElendig> (also filesystem rollback)
[02:12:23] <zillex> but the problem is ALL the info is lost, so absolutely nothing remains.
[02:12:44] <MrElendig> not even a damaged journal file?
[02:12:47] <zillex> My /var/log/journal is completely empty except for 'remote'
[02:13:05] <MrElendig> check teh filesystem check logs then
[02:13:24] <zillex> Where do I find those?
[02:13:48] <MrElendig> might have to set up early logging in the initramfs
[02:14:36] <MrElendig> or instead of rebooting, boot to install iso and manually fsck and see if the journals gets trashed

[04:15:25] <MrElendig> if you want to do the frontend bits
[04:15:46] <notrot> I agree...if you know nothing, gotta learn html and css...

[04:38:06] <MacGyver> 20 years ago we were saying the same thing about 50Mib/s.
[04:38:08] <williewillus> but it is a very nice luxury
[04:38:11] <notrot> I'm fine with my 4G (150mbit, when the RNG god allow it)
[04:38:41] <williewillus> also another big plus of most fiber plans nowadays is symmetric uplink
[04:38:41] <MrElendig> trying to keep under 80% load is useful just for stability though
[04:38:47] <notrot> 6eu/month....the rest, booze&hookers
[04:38:54] <MacGyver> But I definitely like having the ability of marginally outpacing cycling with an external drive.
[04:39:06] <MrElendig> also some isps will go after you if you actually use more than 20% of the link over an extended amount of time :p
[04:39:19] <thrice> notrot: just wait until you're married and kids, you replace booze&hookers with wanting luxury :D

[10:58:20] <hejux> ishitatsuyuki: thanks, bsdtar works indeed. i'm writing a script that tries to work on other Distro as well 
[10:58:30] <grawity> most distros do not have bsdtar by default, though
[10:58:53] <bparker> but they do have unzip
[10:59:01] <bparker> or 7zip
[10:59:17] <bparker> and I didn't know bsdtar used libarchive, that's based
[10:59:28] <grawity> I mean they have packages, sure (7zip tends to vary though) but it's more common to have `unzip` installed than `bsdtar`
[10:59:43] <hejux> ok, i think i'll do a if then else fi

[13:50:08] <susi> I used to plug HDMI in, and set pacmd set-card-profile .... output:hdmi-stereo
[13:50:48] <susi> but now it says HDMI is unplugged in pavucontrol, picture works fine, and audio used to work with this exact same setup and output:hdmi-stereo profile
[13:52:16] <susi> shouldn't all the modules already be loaded and so on, so that -Syu w/o reboot shouln't affect this, or...?
[13:52:38] <susi> though I have not updated the kernel anyways
[13:53:25] <susi> oh wait, seems I have updated the kernel, actually
[13:54:26] <susi> but why would that have anything to do with this, snd_hda_codec_hdmi and others are loaded

[18:27:00] <sheep> probably. New keyes get added to that keyring a few days or weeks before they're first used for packaging
[18:27:05] <A17> I assume signatures don't change often, and when they do, this should fix it barring a more malicious issue
[18:27:11] <A17> Gotcha

[22:23:32] <teraflops> brejela: yeah
[22:23:54] <brejela> pulec: Aaah. Then I'd suggest you fix your docker-compose file and add your packages directly into it.
[22:23:54] <pulec> I am just thinking of rewriting the Dockerfile for alpine
[22:24:06] <brejela> So it deploys with your packages from the get-go.
[22:24:06] <pulec> hm what to fix?
[22:24:16] <petaflot> Betal: that seems just so absurd. like.. I dunno... requesting me to install the drivers for tty
[22:24:17] <pulec> I am simply trying one Dockerfile and it fails on first command
[22:24:30] <pulec> petaflot: you freshly installed?
[22:24:34] <petaflot> pulec: yes
[22:24:41] <pulec> you installed with pacstrap base linux linux-firmware?
[22:24:44] <Betal> petaflot: when you installed arch, didn't you installed a kernel too?
[22:25:03] <brejela> When I installed arch, it didn't come with man. I had to install it.
[22:25:14] <MrElendig> pulec: install guide told you that you might want to install man
[22:25:18] <MrElendig> er.. petaflot 
[22:25:27] <Betal> petaflot: neither kernel is installed by default, why would be 'man'
[22:25:28] <petaflot> Betal: the machine boots, I pacstrapped base and whatever the manual suggested to install
[22:25:32] <pulec> :-)
[22:25:33] <brejela> pulec: I assume your dockerfile just deploys an arch image.

[22:26:49] <DrRac27[m]> I have the same problem on debian and if you want some terrible advice that you should not do for anything other than playing: Download the packages manually, COPY them into the container and just untar them. Of course you need to handle dependencies manually and everything will break sooner or later but it works for my purposes
[22:27:00] *** Joins: IZEASG (~gfv@pc-239-86-214-201.cm.vtr.net)
[22:27:16] <petaflot> like... there's this gentoo project for raspi, that "automatically" installs nano+vim+emacs (really... who needs all three) but stuff like manpages is like "do you want to install a shell"
[22:27:29] <pulec> brejela: it's fine on arch, so I blame kernel and something glibc is related to
[22:27:29] <brejela> pulec: Just make a dockerfile to deploy an alpine image with the packages you want.
[22:27:37] <pulec> yeah, alpining it
