[00:33:45] <dminuoso> The main grief people usually have is that you dont have guaranteed coherence between a) your tables, b) your queries and c) the parsing logic back into your language. ORMs at best take some burden off in terms of migration support, but in my experience you sometimes spend an absurd amount of time in working around various quirks. Writing simple DDL + script migrations gets the job done as well,
[00:33:48] <dminuoso> with the added benefit of full introspectability
[00:34:31] <dminuoso> That being said, I do get how people can be comfortable with them and they do have their reasons. I just do not relate to those reasons

[02:49:05] <mimmy> hey any tips on how to create a superuser for a django app that's been deployed to AWS elastic beanstalk?
[02:49:30] <mimmy> the official doc says you can create a superuser locally and then deploy to production, but i don't get how that's possible (and it doesn't work when I try it)
[02:49:34] <mimmy> docs here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-django.html#python-django-update-app
[02:50:17] *** Parts: blackout69 (~blackout6@net-31-156-121-187.cust.vodafonedsl.it) ()
[02:51:20] <mimmy> my understanding is that i either have to 1) ssh into server and create a superuser there or 2) include a script that does it automatically when the app is deployed.
[02:51:47] <mimmy> but this is my first time doing it so this is all new to me

[02:53:07] <dang`r`us> mimmy, from that page: "This tutorial uses SQLite, which is a database engine included in Python. The database is deployed with your project files. "
[02:53:25] <dang`r`us> so it will in fact deploy the superuser

[05:02:33] <monokrome> does anyone know if there's a way to move models from one app to another without creating an entirely separate model? Essentially, I want to just rename the table, change the new app's initial migration to depend on the other app's last migration, then migrations from then on would be in the new app. Is this possible?
[05:02:57] <monokrome> The whole "create new model, copy all the data, delete old model" thing is not ideal here
[05:05:48] <monokrome> renaming the table is optional as well since we can manually specifc table name - but the real heart of the question is how to transfer future migrations to the new app

[13:27:03] <pycode> hello i have a booleandfield i would like to create two radio buttons Yes or No the problem is that i need to put them in a specific part of the design is it possible to get the "YES" option code and then the "NO" option html code, somehow?
[13:28:53] *** Joins: luigibu (~luigibu@80.30.201.209)
[13:28:56] <GinFuyou> just type it?
[13:29:28] <GinFuyou> Problem that between radio items there would be other elements?
[13:30:11] <pycode> GinFuyou, i have a field called "single_payment" i am inside th QuoteForm so basically the user should select if he want to pay in one solution or with installments, so it is a Yes or No field
[13:30:29] <pycode> the problem yes exactly
[13:30:34] <pycode> those are in different divs
[13:30:56] <pycode> i have two blocks where i put the total (per month) if he choose the installments (so single_payment = no)
[13:31:26] <pycode> etc, so yes graphically it is different so for that reason i would like to work with each radio button
[13:31:30] <GinFuyou> Did a quick check, and looks I remember correctly: it
[13:31:32] <pycode> and put it where i need it
[13:31:47] <GinFuyou> it's not a problem, radio inputs can be anywhere
[13:32:10] <GinFuyou> they are grouped as long as the have same name attr
[13:32:11] <pycode> GinFuyou, no wait... i have TWO RADIO BUTTONs i mean...
[13:32:18] <pycode> the radio for YES and the radio for NO
[13:32:37] <pycode> HOw can i create two with the same name and different value (yes/no)
[13:32:40] <GinFuyou> It's wouldn't have sense to have one radio button it would make it a checkbox
[13:33:15] <GinFuyou> <input type='radio' value='something'> ?

[13:33:27] <pycode> GinFuyou, yes but i mean if i create a radiobutton two radio buttons django will put them togheter (near)
[13:33:34] <pycode> i need to get the first one
[13:33:40] <pycode> oh do you think create the input html myself
[13:33:55] <GinFuyou> by typing it with your keyboard
[13:33:57] <pycode> i thought to use {{form.single_payment.yes}} {{for.single_payment.no}}
[13:34:04] <pycode> or something similar
[13:34:11] <pycode> so i must create them directly
[13:34:29] <pycode> no no it is not a problem ok just asking if i can use the form object or not
[13:34:32] <pycode> but seems not
[13:35:01] <GinFuyou> have to see the widger for radio input but I guessing not, at least not easily
[13:35:19] <pycode> ok i will create the input "manually"
[13:35:20] <pycode> thanks
[13:35:43] <GinFuyou> yes, just make it manually with correct name attr
[13:37:10] <pycode> oook
[13:37:11] <pycode> thanks

[14:20:13] <mad_moses> Hi, I am building a REST-API and have some calls which I want to protect somehow. The api call will be consumed by an android app. Is there something to sign each call (RSA Private / Public keys?) with a key which I will store in the android app? The informations are not critical, but I don't want to make it web scrapper to easy to extract this data.
[14:21:06] <TuringSystem> HTTPs won't do the job for this ?
[14:23:16] <mad_moses> That's not what I mean. Currently I have a few bots which are extracting phone numbers from my website and sell the data to others (I guess). But once I detect someone is extracting data from my website I return fake phone numbers and everything is fine. Now they use the rest API to get the phone numbers.

[14:48:09] <dminuoso> Just write your own authentication backend?
[14:48:15] <dminuoso> Seems quite trivial, honestly
[14:48:55] <dminuoso> You can simply subclass some existing backend you like, and simply do this "look for either" dance in that subclass, and then forward the rest to the superclass that implements your favourite authentication method
[14:49:00] <yanchai> dminuoso: do you have a link for this tutorial?

[14:49:37] <dminuoso> Or like FunkyBob pointed out, just have multiple backends
[14:50:01] <GinFuyou> I made a custom backend once, can't say it was that trivial, but neither something notably hard.
[14:50:29] <dminuoso> GinFuyou: Subclassing an existing to add some additional flavour is definitely trivial
[14:50:51] <GinFuyou> well, it did auth against extetnal api so that might have added to complexity
[14:51:45] <dminuoso> Sure, but the complexity does not lie in the "how do I make this happen in django" part, but merely in whatever it is you wanted to have in the first place

[17:19:09] <pgcd> i ripped out the parts that were clearly for internal use, though, so please test before real use
[17:19:12] <_ganapathi_> dminuoso: didn't understand. so its normal as u saying ?. so what would happen to release  or once memory filled
[17:20:10] <dminuoso> _ganapathi_: Try triggering the gc manually
[17:20:23] <_ganapathi_> how do validate/differentiate its space leak or memory leak.
[17:20:24] <dminuoso> See if that changes the memory footprint
[17:20:32] <_ganapathi_> gc means
[17:20:38] <dminuoso> Memory leaks are rare and usually indicative of FFI or internal bugs
[17:20:56] <dminuoso> Usually its space leaks that ramp up memory usage. A space leak is just holding references to objects, preventing their disposal
[17:21:03] <dminuoso> _ganapathi_: garbage collector
[17:22:01] <_ganapathi_> so anyway to reduce those objects or clearing those objects.
[17:22:03] <_ganapathi_> ooh
[17:23:08] <dminuoso> _ganapathi_: Normally this should happen automatically. Im not saying a manual gc is necessary, but if a manual GC collection reduces memory footprint you have no problem
[17:23:14] <dminuoso> If it doesnt, you likely have a space leak
[17:23:33] <_ganapathi_> ooh ok.
[17:24:07] <dminuoso> Slow moving programs often have a saw tooth shape in external memory view
[17:24:18] <dminuoso> Even if a gc doesnt help
[17:24:34] <dminuoso> So if you plot it over a long time, and its a saw tooth shape, all is good.

[17:27:08] <_ganapathi_> ook. i don't know much detail on this. am trying to understand. So as per google understood as GC means, just an object store/reference once DB query executed and created object then its keep it forever to access it again if am not wrong.

[17:33:18] <yanchai> GinFuyou: i have this scenario and can't figure out how to do it
[17:34:00] <dminuoso> _ganapathi_: So Python uses two simultaneous methods of garbage collection. First, objects have a reference counter, and they get deleted if that reference counter drops to zero.
[17:34:47] <_ganapathi_> ok and.
[17:35:08] <dminuoso> _ganapathi_: The other is via an irregularly ran garbage collector that, roughly, traces the entire world, marks all reached objects, and throws away the rest. And that latter thing might not trigger as frequently

[17:35:33] *** Joins: pycode (~pycode@2001:b07:5d28:551:ed72:45db:341f:4f3e)
[17:35:48] <dminuoso> Python and its underlying C library provides memory management in such a way, that it doesn't instantly release memory back to the operating system.
[17:35:54] <yanchai> GinFuyou: on the docs, we always use 1 users table for authentication right? what if i have 3 types of user. user A: Students uses their SN number to login and only students have SN number. User B: employees uses email to login and User C: guests uses email too. but employess and guest doesnt have SN number which means they will be in a different table?
[17:35:58] *** Joins: READ10 (~dallan@user/read10)
[17:36:26] <dminuoso> _ganapathi_: So this can amplify this apparent nature of "doesnt seem to go back on memory usage"
[17:36:47] <yanchai> GinFoyou: any tips?
[17:36:56] <dminuoso> _ganapathi_: On the previous discussed methods: If of course you keep holding a reference such that neither the reference count drops to zero, and its still found as reachable, that object will be kept alive in memory forever
[17:37:03] <GinFuyou> Well, my recipe is simple: don't have multiple user classes.
[17:37:21] <_ganapathi_> understood
[17:42:46] <yanchai> anyone encountered the same issue i have right now?
[17:43:46] <pgcd> yanchai just use different auth backends
[17:44:09] <pgcd> and one table with all the fields you need across the different kinds of users
[17:46:04] <yanchai> pgcd: SN number are for students, if i put users table sn number that will make a null entry to other user types that are not student?
[17:46:44] <pgcd> yes, that's not a problem at all in general
[17:47:10] <pgcd> but if you want to do it properly you can add another table that only stores SN number and a foreignkey to the user
[17:47:31] <pgcd> and then your auth backend can check that table to see if the SN number is correct
[17:48:34] *** Joins: dor (~erg@78.11.12.207)
[17:49:12] <yanchai> pgcd: if sn number is in a separate table and users table is the auth table, is there a way to auth a user using the separate table?
[17:50:43] <pgcd> yes, that's what I mean. if your other table has a ForeignKey('User', related_name='sn_number') you can do
[17:50:44] <pgcd> User.objects.get(sn_number=<the number you want to check>)
[17:52:02] <yanchai> pgcd: thanks mate! i really appreciate it!
