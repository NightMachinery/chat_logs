[02:15:29] <renaud> leah2: got a reply from t-online.de. They tell me that my server has to be named mail.arnor.org instead of arnor.org and that I must put contact details on the page
[02:16:01] <renaud> leah2: obviously they are either completely stupid or they don't want to provide email service anymore
[02:17:09] <leah2> both
[02:17:53] <leah2> but your banner looks correct?
[02:19:38] <renaud> 220 mail.arnor.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD
[02:19:53] <renaud> I was preparing a reply
[02:19:55] <leah2> or is it about the rdns of the mx?
[02:20:18] <renaud> you can check :) my IP is 91.183.56.64
[02:20:26] <renaud> but FCrDNS is OK
[02:21:10] <renaud> I as thinking about a reply along those lines:
[02:21:11] <renaud> There is no legal information at arnor.org because this is a private server, not a commercial one, so putting my own data there would be controversial to GDPR.
[02:21:13] <leah2> but not for mail.arnor.org?
[02:21:15] <renaud> Therefore, could you allow my IP, which is able to send mails at every server beside yours or should I completely block t-online.de to avoid wasting my queue and CPU power?
[02:21:30] <renaud> mail.arnor.org points to 91.183.56.64
[02:21:39] <leah2> which rnds to arnor.org
[02:21:58] <renaud> and arnor.org points to 91.183.56.64, so FCrDNS is correct

[02:25:52] <renaud> the only thing you could say is that my HELO is not the same as the rDNS, but this is requested nowehere
[02:26:20] <leah2> yeah
[02:26:20] <renaud> and HELO points to mail.arnor.org which points to the correct IP
[02:26:43] <renaud> so, even the HELO can be verified
[02:27:11] <renaud> I am going to send the reply I pasted (minus the block)
[02:29:00] <renaud> or I could put a fake immpressum page
[02:29:10] <renaud> just for them
