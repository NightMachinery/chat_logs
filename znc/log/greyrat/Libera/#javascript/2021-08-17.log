[02:51:58] <PenguinMan98> Nah, if I'm right, then it's a simple matter of z-index
[02:52:21] <PenguinMan98> Though since my bit comes before that one in the html, mine should take precedence and be on top
[02:52:47] <PenguinMan98> _should_ is a dirtier word than jQuery

[03:38:55] <v3ga> question...would you use react if you wanted to build a medium complexity component that can be placed on multiple pages (not a single page app) or would that be overkill?
[03:39:40] <gkatsev> if all the pages are react, definitely
[03:39:40] *** Quits: wroathe (~wroathe@96-88-30-181-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:39:52] <v3ga> I'm not THAT knowledgeable of JS, just sort of scouting around.
[03:40:28] <PenguinMan98> A react app can be as big or small as you wish and can be mounted in any dom container
[03:40:32] <cis> you can build a single component in react as well, even if the rest of your page isn't
[03:40:49] <v3ga> gkatsev: no, the pages won't be react. in fact what I have in mind is a sort of CMS. but I have an idea of a component that changes depending on what type of post I'd like to make. sort of like a floating dashboard or command center.
[03:41:29] <gkatsev> yeah, I think it's worth thinking about it some more then. As other said, you definitely *can* do it
[03:41:38] <PenguinMan98> There is no reason you can't, but one good reason not to: The fewer techs you have to learn to maintain your site, the better.

[03:41:53] *** Joins: hax (~hax@user/hax)
[03:41:53] <gkatsev> but if it's a small enough component, it seems wasteful to require react for it if the page doesn't already use react
[03:41:53] <GreenJello> yeah, once you get past tiny/trivial UI, it can really help to have React or similar
[03:42:05] <v3ga> ok, thats what I figured.  I have at most 3 components that i'd just to just connect in.
[03:42:15] <KevinX> You could try something like AlpineJs or Vue-Petite
[03:42:15] <gkatsev> however, it also depends on what the component is and whether react is really helping out a lot
[03:42:45] <v3ga> GreenJello: yeah, i'm thinking react may make it easier.
[03:42:55] <entuland> all you need to use the same bits on multiple pages is reference their scripts / modules from all the pages, plain old <script> and vanilla JS are able to give you that reusability

[03:44:49] <v3ga> i got the idea from this UI someone mocked up.  So I'd like something like this that lets me control/make different types of posts in my app https://imgur.com/a/LTiCAaV
[03:44:54] <GreenJello> v3ga, it tends to be harder to get to the MVP stage with React, but pays that off when you need to make changes or add new features
[03:45:03] <v3ga> i'm thinking react wouldn't hurt. I know raw JS would turn into hell....

[03:57:05] <sheetjs> for special cases it might be faster to filter+map, but depending on the situation (what percentage of elements you are filtering out) reduce might be faster
[03:57:48] <gkatsev> filter+map is often more readable and more explicit in what's happening. I would recommend going with that until and if you hit a performance issue.
[03:57:52] <neshpion> i thought the main difference was reduce returns a scalar and filter/map return arrays
[03:58:03] <gkatsev> reduce can return an array

[06:48:17] <wroathe> twainwek: It can be GCed any time after the function returns
[06:48:36] <wroathe> twainwek: The details of when that happens are private to the Javascript engine, and shouldn't be relied upon
[06:49:13] <twainwek> ok
[06:49:46] <twainwek> i was just curious if you can get a mem leak by things like that
[06:50:13] <twainwek> but sounds like it's taken care of internally
[06:50:19] <wroathe> twainwek: No, you can't.
[06:50:32] <GreenJello> only if there's some code that could access it in the future
[06:51:51] <GreenJello> but in practice you get memory leaks when you add things to collections that live forever
[06:52:50] <GreenJello> it's pretty rare to leak memory in any other way

[07:29:25] <sheetjs> like node's fs.readFile with the optional encoding argument in the middle
[07:31:06] <GreenJello> you overload the function, I think
[07:31:36] <sheetjs> can you give jsdoc for each signature?

[07:34:13] <sheetjs> lets suppose there's a magic function called "paint" that paints a block of cells
[07:34:27] <sheetjs> and the API designers thought people should be able to specify ranges in multiple ways
[07:34:31] <sheetjs> so it would be something like
[07:34:39] *** codebam is now known as redacted
[07:34:42] <sheetjs> paint(range: string, color: string);
[07:34:50] *** redacted is now known as codebam

[07:36:16] <sheetjs> so in a case like this, you'd want 3 separate docs for each use case
[07:38:07] <systemfault> i don't know how it works with JSDoc but with typescript, you can simply use function overloading
[07:38:10] <gkatsev> yeah, sounds like in TS you'll do function overloading where you define the type multiple times
[07:38:12] *** Joins: gehn (~gehn@user/gehn)
[07:38:30] <gkatsev> for JSDOC, you can likely have the jsdoc comment multiple times with each permutation
[07:39:09] <sheetjs> can you somehow write the body text once and attach the parameter descriptions to each overload?
[07:39:37] <systemfault> In TS, yes.
[07:39:42] <sheetjs> oh
[07:42:34] <sheetjs> vscode doesn't show the master text in the other overloads

[08:27:25] <Emil> Hey

[08:28:54] *** falafel_ is now known as falafel
[08:29:20] <Emil> falafel_: never thought there would be a difference, what's the difference?
[08:30:01] <Emil> From quickly trying to find the difference, is it that properties can be anything and attributes what html allows?
[08:30:06] <Emil> If so attributes are enough
[08:30:25] <Emil> basically I tried document.querySelectorAll('*[placeholder][value]');
[08:30:38] <Emil> to get all elements that have both the placeholder and value attributes
[08:30:38] *** Quits: YoungFrog (~youngfrog@39.129-180-91.adsl-dyn.isp.belgacom.be) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[08:30:55] <GreenJello> for example, an input's .value property is the current value, but the attribute is just the initial value
[08:31:25] <Emil> And what if I'm talking about the attribute name itself?
[08:31:27] *** Joins: YoungFrog (~youngfrog@39.129-180-91.adsl-dyn.isp.belgacom.be)
[08:31:32] <Emil> or property
[08:31:52] <GreenJello> querySelector only operates on attributes
[08:31:57] <falafel> that should work Emil
[08:32:00] <falafel> you don't need the * though
[08:32:10] <falafel> but still, it should work if your inputs have both placeholder nad valud
[08:32:14] <falafel> *and value
[08:32:17] <Emil> hmm
[08:32:23] <falafel> see https://jsfiddle.net/rxjtgun7/
[08:32:52] <Emil> ah, so it needs to be set in html?
[08:33:19] <GreenJello> yes
[08:33:28] <Emil> I suppose I then want to filter by existing properties
[08:33:42] <falafel> in that case you'd have to filter in JS
[08:33:45] <Emil> but then I suppose I'll have to roll my own
[08:33:49] <Emil> yeah, that's too bad
[08:33:57] <Emil> Imho an artificial limitation :/
[08:34:12] <falafel> it's the difference between attributes and propertoes
[08:34:21] *** Quits: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[08:35:33] <GreenJello> it only really makes sense to match on attributes in CSS
[08:35:43] <GreenJello> properties can be getters
[08:36:13] <GreenJello> and querySelector is just CSS selectors
[08:36:27] <Emil> so (also a sidenote I hate how there's no method to go from htmlcollection to an array with normal map, filter etc features) Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName("*")).filter(e=>e.placeholder)

[08:39:32] <Emil> GreenJello: that was for wroathe or me?
[08:39:57] <GreenJello> you
[08:40:02] <Emil> hm?
[08:40:07] <Emil> I'm not sure I follow
[08:40:35] <GreenJello> any element can have an attribute named 'placeholder', but not all have a DOM property named 'placeholder
[08:40:37] <GreenJello> '
[08:40:59] <Emil> ah
[08:41:00] <GreenJello> also it might be the empty string
[08:41:33] <Emil> But an empty string compares false?
[08:41:37] <Emil> anycase that
[08:41:53] <Emil> 's a good point, should I use getattribute or something to check if the element has a dom property placeholder=?
[08:42:06] <GreenJello> "placeholder: string: Returns / Sets the element's placeholder attribute, containing a hint to the user about what to enter in the control." - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement
[08:42:27] <GreenJello> in this case the property (for elements that have it) is tied to the attribute
[08:42:53] <GreenJello> so querySelector will work fine for matching on placeholder
[08:42:58] <Emil> Basically I want all elements that have a set dom property named placeholder
[08:43:51] <Emil> is value somehow different?
[08:43:57] <GreenJello> if you set the property and the attribute doesn't exist, it'll create the attribute, in this specific case
[08:43:59] <GreenJello> yeah
[08:44:11] <Emil> well that's an annoying gotcha
[08:44:58] <GreenJello> properties are designed case-by-case, and don't have the restrictions that you get with attributes
[08:45:08] <GreenJello> the latter being simple key/value pairs

[11:58:46] <theskillwithin> only primatives allowed inside, which record and tuples will be new primatives. Maxdamantus is my understanding
[12:00:12] <banana_> "to ensure that the proposals are in parallel with respect to each other." i.e. "wtf man, we were working on it... aight we cool"
[12:00:13] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: calling record values primitives seems like a misuse of the term. It's just not a reference.
[12:00:49] <Maxdamantus> The notion of "primitive" comes from the idea of "primitive types".
[12:01:26] <theskillwithin> ya they will be new types i think
[12:01:31] <Maxdamantus> If you want to group things into types, you'll consider `0`, `1`, `2`, `-5`, `3.5` and `Infinity` to all be values of one type.
[12:01:48] <Maxdamantus> And `"foo"` and `"bar"` would be values of another type.
[12:02:19] <Maxdamantus> so from those values, you end up with a finite number of "primitive" types: number, string
[12:02:52] <theskillwithin> it explains in the proposal, prob better to read that than to go off what i remember
[12:03:07] <Maxdamantus> If you were to sensibly type records/tuples, you would end up with multiple types, since it's silly to say that `#{ x: 1, y: 2 }` is the same type as `#{ x: "foo", y: "bar" }`
[12:03:52] <Maxdamantus> so you have to consider those things to involve construction of new types, since there's an infinite number of types that a record value could be of.
[12:04:37] <theskillwithin> "Records and Tuples can only contain primitives and other Records and Tuples. You could think of Records and Tuples as "compound primitives". By being thoroughly based on primitives, not objects, Records and Tuples are deeply immutable."

[12:11:53] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: I don't know of any language that has such an arbitrary restriction.

[13:09:48] <Deneb> e.g. why not just write var buf8 = new Uint8ClampedArray(imgd.data.buffer) ?
[13:12:00] <Deneb> I think the intention here was to create to views (8-bit and 32-bit) of the same data, but doesn't the keyword 'new' create two new separate instances of the data?

[13:28:56] <Deneb> so if I undrestand this correctly, buffer creates the new instance, whereas var buf8 and var data are pointers to the existing data in buffer?
[13:29:53] <systemfault> JS has a GC therefore it frees memory whenever it feels like it... but of course, to do so, that memory must not have references left.
[13:30:15] <avu> Deneb: the thing is that `var` is function scope and `let` and `const` are block scope

[13:35:06] <Deneb> systemfault: ok, I follow that and imagined that is what must be happening just didn't understand how. var imgd must be a new instance though? Otherwise why the need to assign it back at the end of the function?
[13:35:13] <matsaman> oh you type let now instead of var? Wow, big =P

[13:37:09] <Deneb> matsaman: yes, that I beleive is the issue. Languages get developeed over time and what I was taught a long time ago may have changed. The difficulty is determining what exeacly and how. I guess this is the issue with the online information as well. Some of those tutorials and posts may be old, others might be relatively new and many of them are not dated so no way of knowing. Trying to sort it all out can be confusing sometimes.
[13:38:00] <systemfault> As far as tutorial goes, everything pre-es6(es2015) is dead...
[13:38:16] <systemfault> Old books like "The Good Parts" are now irrelevant

[13:38:54] <systemfault> Doesn't matter, it's simply not how modern JS is written these days.
[13:38:55] <matsaman> but there are things certain people will think you're a dinosaur over, sure
[13:39:05] <matsaman> yeah but 'modern' is a special word
[13:39:19] <matsaman> that sometimes means only 'contemporary', and sometimes means only 'fad'
[13:39:44] <systemfault> There's no fad, ES6 just changed the landscape, shit like this happens....
[13:39:57] <systemfault> For example, C++11 changed the C++ world
[13:39:58] <matsaman> maybe for some people it did
[13:40:21] <Deneb> matsaman: not looking at the code for the sake of it. There is a problem with it being very slow in FF so that even keypresses are being missed. I found some of it down to using console but that doesn't explain the root problems with it.
[13:40:26] <Deneb> what is es6?
[13:40:34] <matsaman> ecmascript
[13:40:40] <matsaman> is the formal name of "javascript"
[13:40:47] <matsaman> it has versions
[13:40:50] <systemfault> ECMAScript 6, the version of JavaScript that was released in 2015
[13:41:03] <Deneb> avu: I understant function scope, but what is block scope... ok, just googleing that...
[13:41:32] <systemfault> JavaScript cannot be standardized under the name "JavaScript" because that name is the property of Oracle
[13:42:08] <Deneb> ah, ok within if statements and loops
[13:43:28] <Deneb> ok, so ES6 = ECMAScript. So this is what? A new flavour of Javascript, Oracle trademark notwithstanding?
[13:43:47] <Deneb> systemfault: thanks
[13:44:25] <matsaman> think it predates Oracle's direct interest, really: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#History
[13:44:26] <systemfault> ECMA is a standardization committee... like ISO.
[13:44:42] <matsaman> yeah let's see if we can think of another example
[13:45:01] <matsaman> fairly unique situation really

[13:45:45] <matsaman> oh like
[13:45:50] <matsaman> Lisp vs commonlisp
[13:45:54] <matsaman> that mostly works
[13:46:24] <matsaman> most people will just say 'lisp', like 'javascript'
[13:46:30] <matsaman> instead of getting super specific
[13:46:56] <systemfault> But JS doesn't really have many "dialect/flavors" like Lisps...
[13:47:05] <systemfault> Yes.. some do exist but generally...

[13:47:10] <Deneb> matsaman: thanks. Just looking at a wikipedia article. Had to smile when I saw ES.Next....
[13:47:30] <matsaman> =P
[13:47:57] <matsaman> systemfault: true it's not a perfect comparison
[13:48:12] <systemfault> Deneb: After ES5 (in 2015), the JS committee decided to publish a new release every year and use the year and not version number anymore.
[13:48:19] <systemfault> After ES6
[13:48:20] <systemfault> Sorry
[13:48:40] <matsaman> I mean it has other flavors, but they're all pretty out of favor at this point
[13:48:48] <systemfault> So... ES3 -> ES5 -> ES6 -> ES2016 -> ES2017 .... and so on
[13:49:49] <Deneb> systemfault: yes, I see that on wikipaedia. Currently ES2021. Next years is ES.Next until it gets released
[13:50:41] <Deneb> so I take it all browsers now conform to ES? Does Oracle still develop it or is it now fully O/S?
[13:51:37] <systemfault> Yes, browsers conform pretty well these days.
[13:51:55] <systemfault> Oracle has nothing do to with JS... beside owning the word "JavaScript"
[13:52:09] <Deneb> systemfault: probably just as well...
[13:52:43] <Deneb> systemfault: thanks for the explanation
[13:52:53] <matsaman> Oracle bought Sun
[13:52:59] <matsaman> Sun is the 'java' company
[13:53:57] <systemfault> Sun and NetScape announced Java and JavaScript at the same time in 1995... as some kind of PR stunt...
[13:53:59] <Deneb> matsaman: I take the point in comparison to lisp
[13:54:27] <systemfault> The idea was that the "professional" (lol) would be using Java(applets) while amateurs would be using "JavaScript"
[13:54:42] <Deneb> systemfault: well, java was always a major security concern so not exactly great PR...
[13:54:59] <systemfault> It was in 1995
[13:55:05] <Deneb> but that's another story

[13:56:09] <matsaman> or its second
[13:56:25] <systemfault> But it was the one that stuck because of Java...
[13:56:28] <matsaman> but this is all on wikipedia =P
[13:56:35] <matsaman> because coffffeeeeee
[13:56:37] <systemfault> And JS's standard library has a lot of Javaisms in it
[13:57:04] <matsaman> I can't stand Java =P
[13:57:07] <matsaman> liked the mascot, though
[13:57:09] <systemfault> For example, the shitty Date object in JS is a copy of the initial Java Date object... that was deprecated like... a version later.
[13:57:21] <Deneb> systemfault: yes, Netware embraced it an look where it got them... They got very excited about it and started replacing all their admin tools with Java versions. They were slow, clunky and had missing functions over the original versions. Admis often had to use both to get the job done. The resulting confusion did not win them any favours. But yes, that was a long time ago.

[20:07:24] <IceMichael> has anyone experience with the performance difference between chartJS2 vs 3?
[20:08:51] <IceMichael> it feels quite slow for me (could be because of QML integration) and I consider upgrading my chartJS to QML binding to chartJS3

[21:08:00] <hassoon> ljharb: never tried those though, it seems interesting to have one
[21:08:23] <hassoon> they are generally overpriced above the usual headphones, from what i see in online stores
[21:09:10] <ljharb> well sure, they do more things
[21:09:20] <ljharb> that technology's like 20 years old, it's much better now but it's not a new concept
[21:09:29] <ljharb> the airpods noise cancelling is stellar
[21:10:58] <hassoon> so if i put it on my head.. my ears won't hear any noise when i'm in the middle of a party ?
[21:11:18] <ljharb> ideall yes
[21:11:39] <ljharb> it listens to the ambient noise and inverts the sound waves and plays that back, so it largely cancels out the sound
[21:12:35] <hassoon> that's fantastic

[22:39:05] <jellobot> qswz, You're showing us (PHP|ASP|other backend language) code, but asking a question about the browser, which sees the output. Maybe your code produces correct output, maybe it doesn't. Please show us the HTML as the browser sees it.
[22:39:19] <GreenJello> !data
[22:39:20] <jellobot> GreenJello, There's 3 options to properly get data from the server to the client: 1) fetch request from JS. 2) HTML data-* attributes, read them in JS. 3) <script type="application/json"></script>, read and parse it from JS, however this option requires special escaping of </script> in the json body. Never generate/template JS on the fly. See also !fetch
[22:39:49] <GreenJello> interpolating JS code is pretty dangerous
[22:40:02] <qswz> use separate .js files instead of outputting js code from php, just output data as GJ suggests
