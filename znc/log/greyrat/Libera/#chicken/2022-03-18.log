[05:25:12] <irontom> I'm trying to take a look at the source code for the hyde egg. However, when I go check it out using the method described on the chicken site, I get a message that it doesn't exist. 
[05:25:42] <irontom> I was able to checkout a number of other svn hosted eggs, so I don't think it's my horrible svn skills
[05:26:14] <irontom> Is there somewhere else I can find the code?

[21:48:05] <wasamasa> The upstream egg URLs
[21:54:00] <mario-goulart> What about them?  They already are in the wiki.
[21:54:16] <wasamasa> They have been copied into it
[21:54:29] <wasamasa> Once they change, you have an outdated URL there
[21:55:31] <wasamasa> Instead, the page should consist of a dynamic part (the template and upstream URL) and an editable part (the svnwiki content)
[21:58:21] <wasamasa> Like, the egg metadata is recorded somewhere, right
[21:58:48] <mario-goulart> In that particular case I think that would fail, no?  It's an egg for CHICKEN 5 stored in a repository for CHICKEN 4 eggs.
