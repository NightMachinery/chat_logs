[00:46:13] <|xD> ah no idea about that
[00:46:16] <|xD> just burn the antenna
[00:46:17] <|xD> :P
[00:46:27] <|xD> then it is disabled
[00:46:45] <rando25892> its their data i dont care
[00:47:03] <rando25892> did you know the cars computer system if you fudge that up you gotta replace the computer
[00:47:05] <|xD> i dont like cloud cars
[00:47:46] <|xD> why?
[00:47:53] <|xD> you can always backup the flash
[00:47:55] <|xD> and go back
[00:47:56] <|xD> :P
[00:48:37] <rando25892> more like how do you back up the flash
[00:48:56] <|xD> desolder it or clamp it on if it is SO socket
[00:49:29] <|xD> if it is BGA you have to desolder it
[00:49:34] <|xD> and put it on other board to dump
[00:49:54] <rando25892> im not sure what to think
[00:50:01] <|xD> not a job for normal ppl :)
[00:50:05] <rando25892> its okay tho this isnt about my car anyway
[00:51:26] <|xD> but there are many ways
[00:52:53] <rando25892> nah just theres a security feature in my car so it wont start if i mess with the computer module
[00:53:16] <rando25892> !c pk3
[00:53:17] <ImoutoBot> rando25892: I don't know.
[00:53:17] <|xD> there is no security :P
[00:53:29] <|xD> if you understand how it works you can bypass it
[00:53:55] <|xD> and you can access the HW
[00:53:57] <|xD> so no protection
[00:54:54] <rando25892> it says security on the dash when the lights come on
[00:55:05] <|xD> it is a car no tank :)
[00:55:16] <rando25892> its roomier than a tank
[00:55:28] <|xD> what do you want to change?
[00:55:35] <rando25892> you brought it up
[00:55:49] <|xD> if you want remote features disabled you can disconnect antenna
[00:55:55] <|xD> no protection there from that
[00:55:56] <|xD> :P
[00:56:44] <rando25892> im not trying to change jack but know maintenance aka survival skills
[01:04:25] <rando25892> just replacing the computer looks like a pain . connecting it in parallel, having it learn the idle. stock ftw

[04:26:28] <gh0s1> none
[04:26:41] <PancakeMatsuri> Satin, position-independent code. the gist is, if your binary is built as PIC, you won't be able to debug a crash later
[04:26:47] <gh0s1> all, welcome my friend RaGE_Syria 
[04:26:52] <gh0s1> he's new to irc
[04:26:59] <gh0s1> PancakeMatsuri: BULL
[04:27:01] <gh0s1> not 
[04:27:05] <gh0s1> you can debug the crashes 
[04:27:19] <PancakeMatsuri> Satin, so, you might have debug symbols and addresses in RAM, but the address is wrong. addr2line won't work.
[04:27:28] <gh0s1> you just also with PIC are able to load the binary at different addresses
[04:27:35] <RaGE_Syria> How do i add a quote? 
[04:27:37] <PancakeMatsuri> gh0s1, tell me how
[04:27:49] <Satin> interesting
[04:27:51] <PancakeMatsuri> a remote crash has happened
[04:27:52] <gh0s1> gdb --core
[04:27:54] <gh0s1> done
[04:27:59] <gh0s1> set the base address
[04:28:01] <gh0s1> and you are golden
[04:28:02] <PancakeMatsuri> you have addresses from backtrace
[04:28:15] <gh0s1> yeah, tell gdb where the base address is and it'll fix it up
[04:28:18] <RaGE_Syria> !quote
[04:28:18] <ImoutoBot> RaGE_Syria: You have no quotes.
[04:28:26] <PancakeMatsuri> I've no idea where it is
[04:28:30] <gh0s1> look at any modern binaries and you'll see they are compiled with PIC
[04:28:33] <Satin> RaGE_Syria: other people generally add quotes if they're quotable
[04:28:34] <gh0s1> check /proc/maps
[04:28:42] <gh0s1> yeah RaGE_Syria  you "earn" quotes
[04:28:48] <gh0s1> like me :D

[04:29:40] <ImoutoBot> RaGE_Syria: (1 / 1) <R​aGE_Syria> How do i add a quote?
[04:29:43] <RaGE_Syria> hahaha nice!
[04:29:46] <RaGE_Syria> Thank you
[04:29:53] <PancakeMatsuri> gh0s1, only if you make it complicated
[04:29:56] <isekaijin> RaGE_Syria: Use !delquote if you want to remove it.
[04:30:07] <RaGE_Syria> keeping this quote forever
[04:30:28] <gh0s1> you'll get more
[04:30:30] <gh0s1> just earn them
[04:30:36] <PancakeMatsuri> gh0s1, but, well, good to know PIC can work
[04:31:17] <PancakeMatsuri> "computers are complicated" is a way to accept shit
[04:31:57] <isekaijin> PancakeMatsuri: Well, computers could be simpler. After all, at some point in time, they were simpler than today's computers.
[04:32:04] <isekaijin> But users don't want simple computers. They want fast ones.
[04:32:31] <DunceCotus> simple, fast, uncomplicated nanoprocessing
[04:32:51] <isekaijin> Especially since webshits keep pumping programs that run unacceptably slow on anything less powerful than their development machines.
[04:33:17] <PancakeMatsuri> isekaijin, don't underestimate how painful webdev is
[04:33:34] <gh0s1> anyway, get the mapped start address from /proc/maps at runtime or if its a crash, the segfault address should be logged to journalctl
[04:33:56] <PancakeMatsuri> isekaijin, SPA is an example of overcomplicating things, that is widely acceptead
[04:34:09] <isekaijin> PancakeMatsuri: What part of Zoom or Discord or VS Code *needs* to be built using web technologies?

[04:37:46] <amigojapan> I had a dream I was playing videogames I made a long time ago in MS-DOS
[04:38:20] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan, I envy your dreams
[04:38:43] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: my dreams can be very bad
[04:38:58] <PancakeMatsuri> isekaijin, my PC is over 5 yo though, and it runs Discord fine
[04:42:09] <isekaijin> Discord is simultaneously way larger and way less configurable than your run-of-the-mill IRC client. It is hard to do basic things such as sharing an image link without immediately showing the image on the client itself.
[04:45:08] <amigojapan> Weechat is tiny
[04:48:13] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: do you enjoy dark things? I can show you a very dark Japanese song tomako found and we are enjoying
[04:49:21] <Emil> Hey could anyone offer any pointers in findin the Japanese version (raw) version of NANA. Afaik they were released in the Cookie magazine 2009.4-2009.7

[06:15:37] <ButterNoodle> by the time the irs figures it out and tries to levy penalties, just find a way to be insolvent and get out of the payment

[06:16:11] <ButterNoodle> I wish death on them all Jigsy
[06:16:26] <ButterNoodle> like getting held down and fucked to death
[06:16:42] <Nanobot> Basically, my tax estimates have been based on FIFO and LIFO. But, if I do a slight variation from LIFO (by basically ignoring the most recent two purchases prior to the tax year, and doing LIFO from there), then those initial sells would be long-term instead of short-term and thus taxed more favorably.
[06:16:59] <ButterNoodle> please try to decrypt all my drives and usb sticks full u cat pictures..
[06:17:17] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: depends on how ur holding

[06:17:57] <Nanobot> I'm thinking of just doing regular LIFO and paying the $16k extra, unless I can make a modification to my spreadsheet to automatically account for variations like this.
[06:18:03] <ButterNoodle> this years savings could be negated if the remainder gets taxed unfavorably 5 years later
[06:18:23] <ButterNoodle> *smoke em if u gottem
[06:18:24] <ButterNoodle> ig
[06:18:31] <amigojapan> Ouch Nanobot 
[06:18:43] <ButterNoodle> I'm not at the point of cashing anything out unfortunately
[06:18:50] <ButterNoodle> I should have when we hit ATH
[06:19:09] <amigojapan> Nanobot: I would go thru the hassle to save 16k
[06:19:26] <ButterNoodle> but I have about 20K in debts written off that is counted as income this year
[06:19:31] <amigojapan> Nanobot: you could buy a good car with that
[06:19:33] <Nanobot> ButterNoodle: My trades are already done for the tax year. It's just a matter of how I match up the buys with the sells. My spreadsheet does the two most common strategies so I can compare them, but even those are pretty complicated. Adding more complexity is just begging for mistakes.
[06:20:13] <ButterNoodle> and then what happens if uncle sugar wants an audit on ur crypto when they get caught up in about 15 years
[06:21:06] <ButterNoodle> like the shitty ex post facto shit our wonderful gubberment is good a doing
[06:21:15] <Nanobot> I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything legally. If I get audited, it'll be a pain in the butt to do the work, but I don't think I'm in any legal trouble.
[06:22:10] <ButterNoodle> naa.. they will see crypto and just audit u into insanity if they feel like it.. hopefully by then there will be too many of us that they just wont have time to care
[06:22:18] <Nanobot> I'm already saving about $36k by using LIFO instead of FIFO.
[06:22:22] <Jigsy> The key to getting audited is to make their job tediously boring.

[06:22:51] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: they are bureaucrats.. their dicks get hard at boring and tedious

[07:37:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sounds like you'll need root canals
[07:37:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: get xrays done etc.
[07:38:37] <amigojapan> Yup DunceCotus root canals is better than getting the teeth pulled out, which this dentist did once. And I am still missing that molar
[07:38:41] <DunceCotus> head............ cheese
[07:39:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah it definitely is better than extraction
[07:39:24] <DunceCotus> though depends on the extent of the ROT
[07:40:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: have you had root canal before?
[07:40:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I had an absessed tooth in the molar he pulled out

[07:52:03] <DunceCotus> of course this commercialism was always a problem in rave mk. 1

[11:27:05] <MootPoot> can you explain lens compatiblity to me
[11:27:07] <JesseDesu2> dslr is technically a reflex mechanical mirror
[11:27:18] <MootPoot> can I stick a canon lens on a nikon
[11:27:19] <JesseDesu2> canon has ef-m mounts
[11:27:20] <MootPoot> etc
[11:27:23] <JesseDesu2> no
[11:27:26] <JesseDesu2> generally not
[11:27:28] <MootPoot> oh
[11:27:36] <MootPoot> are there adapters which let you do that?
[11:27:36] <JesseDesu2> stick with same brands
[11:27:40] <JesseDesu2> yes
[11:27:45] <JesseDesu2> sigma for example
[11:27:51] <JesseDesu2> is a lens manufacturer
[11:27:57] <JesseDesu2> they make aftermarket cheaper options
[11:28:20] <JesseDesu2> basically each camera has a family of mounts
[11:28:24] <JesseDesu2> that sounds naughty
[11:28:27] <MootPoot> each brand?
[11:28:49] <JesseDesu2> like canon has ef-m, the one i use
[11:28:54] <JesseDesu2> and yes there are adapters
[11:29:04] <JesseDesu2> i never heard of a cross brand one tho
[11:29:18] <MootPoot> so you buy 3rd party lenses
[11:29:27] <JesseDesu2> usually an adapter is something to make a non auto focus into an autofocus
[11:29:30] <MootPoot> then you have to get a adapter for your brand of camera
[11:29:36] <MootPoot> then it'll fit
[11:29:42] <JesseDesu2> some 3rd party will work straight
[11:29:45] <JesseDesu2> without an adapter
[11:30:00] <JesseDesu2> what brand are tyou leaning towards

[11:30:25] <JesseDesu2> leica if you're a hipster
[11:31:04] <JesseDesu2> you might hear terms thrown around like full frame
[11:31:29] <JesseDesu2> full frame is basically a sensor the size of traditional 35mm film
[11:31:33] <MootPoot> I already have a nikon d5500 I'll be getting
[11:31:43] <JesseDesu2> you can do with smaller frames with denser pixel count

[11:35:31] <MootPoot> what 3rd party brands are cheaper but still okay
[11:35:44] <JesseDesu2> sigma i guess
[11:35:58] <JesseDesu2> i might of rented one before
[11:36:01] <MootPoot> cheaper then official nikon?
[11:36:24] <JesseDesu2> theres things like chromatic abberation if you're really nit picky
[11:36:32] <JesseDesu2> in cheaper stuff
[11:36:41] <JesseDesu2> purple fringe artifacts
[11:37:33] <JesseDesu2> ok i just looked up the DX sensor on the model you're getting
[11:37:38] <JesseDesu2> its smaller than full frame
[11:38:17] <MootPoot> no, I just want sharpness and brightness

[11:39:27] <MootPoot> I think it has the kit lens with it so
[11:39:31] <JesseDesu2> chromatic abberation is sort of a refraction thing that causes rainbow color distortion on edge details
[11:39:33] <MootPoot> I might need to buy the shorter one
[11:39:36] <MootPoot> yeah I know what it is

[12:01:36] <JesseDesu2> fish eye lenses are for a special type of photography

[13:55:58] <KatrinValerie> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_befreite_Zone
[13:55:59] <ImoutoBot> [title] National befreite Zone – Wikipedia
[13:56:06] <Satin> > Vulnerable area (Swedish: Utsatt område) is a term applied by police in Sweden to areas with high crime rates and social exclusion.[1][2][3] In the December 2015 report, these areas numbered 53.[4] In the June 2017 report, these totalled 61. The increase is reported to be due to better reporting, not a changing situation.[5] The overall trend is that these areas are improving.[6] 
[13:56:08] <KatrinValerie> This refers to the German right wing phenomenom
[13:56:09] <HeTo> Satin: if you consider no go zones are a thing in eastern Germany but not in the US, I'd posit you have different thresholds for what a no go zone is
[13:56:12] <MootPoot> I remember the brexit propoganda about areas of london being no go zones
[13:56:33] <Satin> HeTo: the term "no go zones" is used by these governments in europe
[13:56:38] <MootPoot> Satin: yeah, so like I said - its just a zone with higher crime , not " go there and you will probably die"
[13:56:41] <MootPoot> Satin: no, thats a media term
[13:56:47] <Satin> nope
[13:56:57] <HeTo> Satin: now the police in the US probably have a different threshold too, because in the US police can just shoot anything that moves, at least if it's not white
[13:56:58] <MootPoot> it started out as a racist propoganda term
[13:57:01] <MootPoot> from the alt right
[13:57:13] <MootPoot> "mass immigration results in no go zones" etc etc
[13:57:17] <lastonestanding> but a ghetto can be a dangerous zone too
[13:57:21] <KatrinValerie> Satin: In Germany the term got popular through a radio interview on Deutschlandradio Kultur
[13:57:21] <Satin> "In the 21st century, the term has most often been used to refer to areas that police or medical workers consider too dangerous to enter without heavy backup. Government officials and journalists from various European countries, including France[3] and Germany,[4] have used the term to describe neighborhoods within their own country."
[13:57:28] <HeTo> Satin: whereas police in countries like Sweden have to take different steps to protect themselves
[13:57:53] <Satin> HeTo: yeah I'm not trying to say the US is better or anything like that, but when it comes to the term "no-go zones" they clearly exist as an established concept in European countries
[13:58:01] * Sadale launches google translate
[13:58:03] <Satin> and are even used by the government
[13:58:14] <Satin> this is not a thing in the US/north america
[13:58:18] <MootPoot> Satin: that dosen't speicfy where the term came from , and does not specifiy if its a offical term or just a subsitutte
[13:58:24] <KatrinValerie> Satin: I am aware that the term was previously coined to justify more heavy policing of certain areas and was mostly directed against migrants.
[13:58:24] <Satin> lol?
[13:58:25] <MootPoot> Satin: your own link did not call them no go zones
[13:58:37] <lastonestanding> Satin: don't you have ghettos and gated communities?
[13:59:03] <Satin> MootPoot: maybe if you'd actually read it
[13:59:10] <Satin> > "These areas are sometimes called no-go zones, as emergency services such as fire engines and ambulances cannot drive into these areas during a tense situation without a police escort as they will be attacked by criminal gangs.[3]"
[13:59:21] <HeTo> Satin: but they do also exist in the US. and maybe they are so normal there that it's just a given that in some areas you need to go in with a heavier response if you are going there, whereas in Europe it's special and therefore there is information about their existence
[13:59:23] <Satin> and governments in europe have used the term
[13:59:30] <Sadale> Sad. Sad to see such a place even exist in first world countries
[13:59:53] <MootPoot> no-go implies like "enter and u die"
[14:00:00] <MootPoot> which is just not the case
[14:00:03] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: eh, generally anywhere can become unsafe if you do not tackle the issue of poverty properly.
[14:00:05] <Satin> lastonestanding: I'm not interested in a debate about whether the US has no-go zones or not, I'm saying, the concept of no-go zones as a desgination in europe exists and is established, and is even used by governments
[14:00:10] <Satin> which was the original point of contention
[14:00:24] <Sadale> I really got spoiled by HK (China) real badly. The social order here's mostly well-maintained.
[14:00:29] <Satin> they simply don't exist as a concept in the US
[14:01:04] <Satin> we have very dangerous neighbourhoods in certain cities for sure, but we don't have some official designation or laws barring so and such like certain european countries have as designations
[14:01:18] <lastonestanding> is there a reason why you compare the US with whole europe? should it not be country vs country?
[14:01:19] <Satin> and anyways, the point is mootpoot thinks this is just a lie invented by the right wing when it's not quite what he thinks it is
[14:01:32] <KatrinValerie> Satin: in Germany it is an informal thing
[14:01:38] <Satin> lastonestanding: I purposely said "certain european countries" above.

[14:01:55] <Emil> but 81-84 is a lot of screenshots :D
[14:02:01] <MootPoot> it is a lie - that got converted into standard lingo by the media

[14:30:50] <MootPoot> lastonestanding: those traits are unique to every poor country for the most part
[14:30:56] <MootPoot> or a country that is not well developed
[14:31:14] <Sadale> Perhaps it's actually easier to raise a child in those poorer countries? :O
[14:31:17] <MootPoot> lastonestanding: you can look at birthrates in the USA 100 years ago vs today
[14:31:31] <MootPoot> Sadale: yeah cuz you raise them till they're like 10 then send them off to work
[14:31:32] <MootPoot> lol
[14:31:33] <Sadale> Think about why we're not having kids. That's because kids are expensive and we've got 9-5 work schedule.
[14:31:45] <HeTo> it's also, because so many people die young, parents have to make as many kids as possible to have someone to survive to support them if the parents manage to live until they're old
[14:31:48] <Sadale> So we don't have time to take care of the kids.
[14:32:13] <Bco1981> so you have to pay to have the kids taken care off
[14:32:21] <MootPoot> the entire idea of "taking care of the kids" is different 
[14:32:23] <MootPoot> here vs there
[14:32:24] <Sadale> But in those poorer countries, they're busy for sure. But they don't have 9-5 work schedule. Maybe that'd somehow make raising kids easier than in developed world?
[14:32:36] <MootPoot> here you need big brain power to make money, so you need to invest more into one kid
[14:32:44] <MootPoot> over there having more kids is a financial asset
[14:32:53] <MootPoot> more people = more money from primary industries
[14:32:58] <MootPoot> so its not a cost to have kids

[14:50:21] <HeTo> the definition I've heard those who argue they exist use is that they are areas that the police would not enter with a regular patrol but need a stronger force if they are to go there, or that emergency services wouldn't enter without a police escort

[15:48:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, Mandarin is standard Chinese language. Cantoense is a dialect.

[15:49:05] <zoidberg> Wait, it’s a dialect?
[15:49:06] <lastonestanding> similar to an orange
[15:49:07] <MootPoot> so do most people speak mandarin?
[15:49:13] <lastonestanding> but smaller I think
[15:49:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, To me, when you say Chinese, it's Mandarin. However, context matters. If you walk around here in HK (China) and say the word "Chinese language", quite a bit of people would think that it refers to Cantonese because that's the main kind of Chinese dialect being spoken here.
[15:49:37] <MootPoot> which is the more common one

[15:52:19] <MootPoot> if they cant undertand each other then its not even the same language
[15:52:23] <MootPoot> ?
[15:52:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, Cantonese people can't spoeak Mandarin without training. Most of us are trained to speak a bit of Mandarin tho
[15:52:27] <PancakeMatsuri> Sadale, that's how segregation didn't end

[15:53:05] <HeTo> MootPoot: what is a language and what is a different language is defined politically, not linguistically
[15:53:08] <MootPoot> Sadale:  so when you go onto chinese websites to order stuff - taobao etc - the language for those are manderin ( written )
[15:53:16] <Sadale> yep.
[15:53:26] <MootPoot> but local hk websites are written in cantonese
[15:53:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope. hmm. let me try to explain
[15:53:55] <Sapphirus> i guess China's assimilation of Hong Kong is finally complete.
[15:54:16] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you speak Mandarin, it's simple. You just mostly write down whatever you speak out loud. In Cantonese, there's "verbal" language and "written" language. The written one is almost the same as Mandarin.
[15:54:26] <Sapphirus> just pretend with the formalities so they can keep the financial exchanges open
[15:54:45] <Sapphirus> if it wasn't for that, HK would just be China without the formalities
[15:55:05] <MootPoot> Sadale: so from your POV - the writing is the same but the manner of speaking is different?
[15:55:11] <Sapphirus> CCP has no reason to uphold the treaties as they stand now given how they've violated them. Only up to the extent it's to their benefit.
[15:55:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, Here the "verbal" language is only written in informal stuffs. For anything formal like a online shopping website, we'll use formal Chinese writing.
[15:55:47] <Sapphirus> basically hk is a financial gateway for mainland china until it isn't
[15:55:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, yep. Anyway time to confuse you further more! In fact, due to the influence of spoken Cantonese and shit, the formal Chinese writing of Cantonese people is a tiny bit different from the formal Chinese writing of Mandarin people :P
[15:55:59] <Sapphirus> at least tha'ts the way I see it
[15:55:59] <MootPoot> if you wanted to make a public accouncement say, and send the same message to mainland china and HK you would write it in formal writing which can be read by both manderin and cantonese
[15:56:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, yep! Mostly. :3
[15:56:35] <MootPoot> but if a mandarin and cantonese person each read that message, and tried to talk to each other about it , they would fail
[15:56:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, And here's another confusion for you: In HK and Macau, we use traditional Chinese characters. And in mainland China, we use simplified Chinese characters. So the way that some of the characters are written can be different. Training is needed on this one.
[15:57:08] <MootPoot> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[15:57:10] * MootPoot explodes
[15:57:10] <Sadale> haha! Have I managed to get you confused? :P
[15:57:24] <Sadale> I can read simplified Chinese tho. xD
[15:57:40] <MootPoot> tbh it sounds like a genuine pain the asshole
[15:57:43] <MootPoot> to deal with
[15:57:44] <Sapphirus> All I know about Chinese language is that the first Chinese anime I came across I couldn't stand
[15:57:48] <Sadale> If you can't read simplified Chinese you'd need to guess the actual Chinese character by context
[15:58:00] <MootPoot> is it the same in the eastern provinces and northern ones as well?
[15:58:15] <Sapphirus> it just sounded grating
[15:58:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you're talking about the mainland China, AFAIK, the entire mainland China speaks Mandarin, either as primary spoken dialect or the secondary one. Every provinces speak Mandarin, especially for younger generations.
[15:59:02] <MootPoot> oh really?
[15:59:18] <MootPoot> I heard that the very north mainland and west ones have their own dialects
[15:59:19] <Sadale> yep. They do have their own dialect. But the younger generation all speak Mandarin.
[15:59:23] <Sapphirus> I'd respect China more if it wasn't such an authoritarian hellhole, but that's just my two cents
[15:59:37] <Sapphirus> Taiwan is doing great, so there's that.
[15:59:42] * Sadale reports Sapphirus to the Chinese cops :D
[15:59:46] <HeTo> well, if you're including secondary ones as well, doesn't the same apply to Hong Kong?
[15:59:46] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: you done with your 2 cents?
[16:00:09] <Sapphirus> Sadale, i'd be surprised if they don't already know about me
[16:00:17] <Sadale> HeTo, yeah. Arguably tho people in HK can't speak Mandarin as good as the people in mainland China.
[16:00:17] <Sapphirus> given I speak like this quite a lot 
[16:00:34] <MootPoot> okay, so
[16:00:40] <HeTo> also, there's enough variation within Mandarin that you can take two native Mandarin speakers speaking their local dialects and they won't understand each other. they would have to make an effort to speak standard Mandarin
[16:01:29] <Sapphirus> to be incredibly fair, there's some English speakers I can barely understand, so it isn't the most strange thing to hear of that being a thing.
[16:01:43] <HeTo> well, the same is probably true of Yue (which Cantonese is a dialect of)
[16:01:55] <MootPoot> there is traditional chinese writing which everyone understands, then there is  casual local dialect, which they dont understand. However, the mainland uses traditional and simplified, whereas in HK they only use traditional
[16:01:59] <MootPoot> is that correct Sadale ?
[16:02:46] <Sadale> MootPoot,  awww not exactly
[16:02:56] <Sapphirus> I'd rather learn Japanese over Mandarin if it came down to choosing a foreign language to learn.
[16:03:15] <HeTo> MootPoot: keep the writing system and the language separate
[16:03:16] <Sapphirus> don't know if I have the capacity to sustain the attention required to do it
[16:03:31] <Sapphirus> I could probably do it IN Japan, but that's a fantasy.
[16:04:21] <Sadale> MootPoot, there is chinese writing which everyone mostly understands. Mainland uses simplified Chinese characters. HK and Macau uses traditional Chinese characters. Then there is casual local dialect, which they dont understand. In mainland China Mandarin is understood everywhere. In HK and Macau Mandarin is mostly understood but to lesser extent.

[16:04:49] <Sadale> MootPoot, Not all traditional Chinese characters are different from the simplified counterpart. Not all characters got simplified.
[16:04:58] <MootPoot> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[16:05:06] <HeTo> MootPoot: you can write Mandarin in either traditional or simplified characters. similarly you can use traditional characters to write Mandarin or Cantonese, just like you can use the Latin alphabet to write English or Swedish
[16:05:28] <Sadale> MootPoot, Example: Traditional: 恭喜發財 Simplified: 恭喜发财
[16:05:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, Notice how the first two characters are identical. The third one looks different. And the last one looks almost the same.
[16:06:22] <MootPoot> the simplified one looks like kanji or somth
[16:06:33] <Sapphirus> Sadale, the only question I have with regards to this is the difference between Traditional Chinese and Japanese Kanji.
[16:06:53] <Sapphirus> is the difference only in meaning or

[16:07:14] <MootPoot> isen't japanese just a evolution off of chinese?
[16:07:20] <Sadale> Sapphirus, The meaning can vary for quite a bit.
[16:07:21] <Sapphirus> That's the way I Understand it, MootPoot.
[16:07:33] <HeTo> Sapphirus: kanji are also simplified but not nearly as much or consistently as simplified Chinese
[16:07:42] <Sadale> MootPoot, Japanese has an entire different root from Chinese. They just stole the Chinese writing system.
[16:07:45] <MootPoot> somebody git --pull then pushed to a new branch then there was japanese
[16:08:24] <Sadale> To be fair tho, they did copy some of the pronounciations from Chinese.
[16:08:40] <Sadale> I mean pronunciation of characters.
[16:09:59] <Sadale> lol this entire Chinese and Japanese language thingie's a clusterfuck. So many dialects on top of Mandarin. So many different kind of writing systems (Traditional, Simplified, Japanese). xD
[16:10:06] <MootPoot> its like linux
[16:10:08] <MootPoot> lol
[16:10:19] <Sadale> not to mention Japanese doesn't have much to do with Chinese if you're talking about the root of the language :P
[16:10:21] <Sadale> lol linux xD
[16:10:41] <MootPoot> its all linux but there are 1000000 distros that all do their own thing
[16:10:42] <MootPoot> lol

[16:11:41] <Sadale> yeah. They're no longer in use.
[16:12:03] <Sadale> Oh actually Chinese characters are still being used in Korea. They're taught that in highschool or something.
[16:12:21] <Sadale> They just don't use that in daily writings. But they know Chinese characters, probably in Korean variant
[16:13:12] <HeTo> and hangul is mostly based on the same strokes as Chinese characters so it's not totally unrelated (they have a round shape in two consonants though)
[16:13:28] <HeTo> as a script
[16:13:53] <MootPoot> Sadale: once at my old job I had to work on a SDK for a device which was only documented in chinese

[16:13:55] <MootPoot> lololol

[16:56:58] <MootPoot> sex toy RFID
[16:57:39] <Sadale> Maybe we need three counts. a masturbation counter, a sex toy counter and a foreign body part counter
[16:57:59] <MootPoot> well, actually, no
[16:58:04] <Sadale> Each of the counter would serve people with different boundaries
[16:58:13] <MootPoot> wouldn't the sex toy counter be the same as the masturbation counter?
[17:00:17] <Sadale> no. Some people may not like their partner using sex toys
[17:00:26] <Sadale> And it could be someone else using the sex toy on you
[17:00:57] *** Quits: Berlin36 (~Berlin36@user/berlin36) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:00:58] <Sadale> hmm. Now I've got a problem. How could the chip tell between masturbation, sex toy and foreign body parts?
[17:01:08] <MootPoot> only in ##anime can we change what was a weird fetish into a systems design and architecture problem
[17:01:24] <MootPoot> my professors would be proud
[17:02:39] <MootPoot> for masturbation it would detect nothing , sex toy would be detecting the tag on the toy and other body parts would probably be a mix of detecting the other tag and looking for other physical changes
[17:02:50] <MootPoot> maybe add detector for vag juice or something 
[17:03:02] <MootPoot> lollololololol
[17:03:08] <MootPoot> hydrometer
[17:03:34] <MootPoot> here in ##anime we're already halfway to 1984 lol
[17:04:46] <Sadale> If both tags are passive, they can't detect each others.
[17:04:51] <Sadale> We need to power it somehow
[17:05:00] <MootPoot> active tags with those button cells
[17:05:11] <Sadale> or somehow use the electricity right inside our body?
[17:05:29] <MootPoot> use those flex power sensors to get power
[17:05:38] <MootPoot> or pico dynamos
[17:05:48] <Sadale> Oh. If you're having sex you'd need some kind of insertion motion.
[17:05:54] <Sadale> We could generate power using that motion
[17:06:29] <MootPoot> Sadale: could it possibly just slowly charge over the days using power from wifi 
[17:06:39] <MootPoot> it only needs to send out one burst
[17:06:43] <Sadale> hmm.
[17:06:48] <Sadale> Then people would cheat
[17:07:08] <Sadale> Especially for woman. They could cum as many time as they want
[17:07:19] <MootPoot> then their count goes higher
[17:07:36] <MootPoot> then we can call all the women whores and all the men are pure inexperienced virgins
[17:07:37] <Sadale> So they'd have multiple sessions in a short time to drain the battery of the tag.
[17:07:41] <MootPoot> reverse the gender roles
[17:07:44] <MootPoot> lolololool
[17:07:49] <Sadale> When the battery is out of power it can't count.
[17:07:59] <MootPoot> Sadale: maybe use the wifi to maintain the power and motion to power it when in use?
[17:08:09] <Sadale> hmm. that works
[17:08:25] <Sadale> Done. Now, go ahead and implement the whole thing :P
[17:08:28] <Sadale> I won't be helping xD
[17:08:31] <MootPoot> lol
[17:08:40] <MootPoot> we need somebody who can actually have sex to test it
[17:08:41] <MootPoot> lololol
[17:09:10] <MootPoot> its nice memin around like this with you Sadale 
[17:09:22] <MootPoot> haven't done that in ages since work made me go to sleep
[17:09:30] <MootPoot> now I can stay awake all night
[17:09:33] <MootPoot> and talk about ecchi things
[17:09:59] <Sadale> lol
[17:10:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean what else to do in ##anime? :P
[17:10:18] <MootPoot> argue about geopolitics 
[17:10:20] <MootPoot> or something
[17:10:21] <MootPoot> idk
[17:10:57] <MootPoot> on the last episode of sonny buy
[17:11:03] <MootPoot> good anime
[17:11:13] <Sadale> argue about how Sadale is totally not a capitalist :3
[17:11:32] <MootPoot> do you have IRL friends in HK Sadale ?
[17:11:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope
[17:11:51] <MootPoot> no friends from HS or uni?
[17:12:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, there're just acquaintances IMO. My true friends are on the internet
[17:12:30] <Sadale> Maybe if you count my imouto, then yes. I do have a friend
[17:12:51] <MootPoot> tbh as time goes on it seems like it is harder to have quality online friendships
[17:12:59] <MootPoot> a lot of....subtext? and context goes missing
[17:13:15] <MootPoot> you cant really observe, only read what the other says
[17:13:32] <MootPoot> not that its a big deal, but I have heard some people online say that
[17:13:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, I dunno. I just find it more comfortable to talk with online users :3
[17:14:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, The thing is that I was never good a socialization back in my early days all the way up to college. I've only become not terrible in socializing after being out of college for a year.
[17:14:38] <MootPoot> but I guess its a little different in IRL as well - its harder to get over the wall of aquaintance 
[17:14:46] <MootPoot> like, for example Sadale - say I bought you lunch
[17:15:05] <MootPoot> would you refuse it / try to be polite / try to pay half?
[17:15:08] <Sadale> MootPoot, plus, I don't like people IRL. They're far too money-minded.
[17:15:22] <Sadale> more like they have to be money-minded. To be fair tho I'm rather money-minded IRL.
[17:15:24] <MootPoot> or just take it and maybe treat me back later
[17:15:32] <Sadale> With this mentality I can't really make friends.
[17:15:54] <MootPoot> tbh I think people are just money minded because they have to be
[17:15:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, hmm. If it's you, I guess I'd take it? Considered that you're my friend here. :3
[17:16:13] <Sadale> MootPoot, plus you ain't those filthy capitalistic dogs. :P
[17:16:16] <MootPoot> there are studies saying that happiness does not increase after you make more then 70k USD or something
[17:16:26] <Sadale> And maybe I'd pay back somehow. I dunno.
[17:16:32] <MootPoot> but also it does if you make more slowly
[17:18:46] <MootPoot> Sadale: I notice that aquantances IRL tend to be a log more focused on tit for tat
[17:19:04] <MootPoot> like, they cant just take/give something and not care...or maybe that's just my limited experrience
[17:19:25] <MootPoot> seems like it takes a LONG time to get from aquaintance to friend
[17:19:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, yeah.
[17:19:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, One thing that I don't like about IRL is that I can't just walk out when I see something that I don't like
[17:20:00] <Sadale> In the internet I could just switch to another window and chat on
[17:20:22] <Sadale> And there're something that I'd avoid talking about IRL lest getting myself into trouble. Like lewd stuffs
[17:20:31] <Sadale> It could be taken as sexual harrasment :/
[17:20:36] <Sadale> and I could get sued
[17:21:04] <MootPoot> lol
[17:21:07] <Sadale> Oh. And another thing I like about the internet is that I could pick whatever community that I share common interest in. Like Libera, it has a lot of tech people.
[17:21:13] <MootPoot> doubt it matters with another dude
[17:21:35] <Sadale> dunno.

[17:22:16] <MootPoot> I'll talk about it a little but it depends on the audience
[17:22:27] <Sadale> Just so you know I actually take acquaintances IRL as second-class. Meanwhile, I take users online as first-class citizen.
[17:22:29] <MootPoot> but 90% of the time not going to
[17:22:49] <MootPoot> I kind of just hold them both in the same class really
[17:23:04] <Sadale> And it aligns with my retirement plan. If I'm making friends IRL I can't take them to my retirement destination. But for online friends, I get to keep all of them :3
[17:23:31] <Sadale> My ultimate objective is to build my life in the internet and life inside the internet :3
[17:23:57] <Sadale> oh. There're another thing that I like about internet. I could give away stuffs for free here :3
[17:24:01] * Sadale gives MootPoot a cookie :3
[17:24:07] <MootPoot> I really dont like it when online people make a commitment then instantly bail if somebody IRL calls for something non-essential
[17:24:13] <Sadale> IRL I'd have to pay for that :3
[17:24:14] <MootPoot> I have a few contact which do that
[17:24:24] <MootPoot> well, you could just hand it to them lol
[17:24:40] <Sadale> ah. I do avoid making commitments.
[17:24:56] <MootPoot> I only make them when I'm 90%+ sure I can keep them
[17:25:08] <lastonestanding> ##anime used to be #anime
[17:25:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, Maybe we could arrange a time that we could play a silly game or something :P
[17:25:20] <MootPoot> I dont mind, but afaik you aren't really into games
[17:25:38] <Sadale> There was two ##anime back in freenode. Mekely split freenode ##anime off freenode #anime somehow
[17:25:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, depends on what kind of game it is :P
[17:26:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, you're right tho. I don't game that much. Previously I played a game once a week with an online friend tho :3
[17:26:15] <MootPoot> I guess it would have to support linux so that reduces the options massively
[17:26:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. I could use Windows for gaming.
[17:26:29] <Sadale> I've got a portable Windows SSD.
[17:26:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, hmm. how about osu? I could arrange my imouto to join as well if it's osu xD
[17:27:18] <Sadale> If not you could pick a casual game that wouldn't require me to commit time every week/month to play it :P
[17:27:31] <MootPoot> yeah, that's the thing
[17:27:43] <MootPoot> I play casually, but I play regularly, if that makes any sense
[17:27:56] <MootPoot> I dont scedule when I play but I play a few times a week usually aroudn the same time
[17:27:59] <Sadale> ah. I don't play regularly. xD
[17:28:27] <Sadale> If you've got a job tho I think the only possible time to play is weekends because our timezone are too different
[17:29:07] <MootPoot> yeah, and that's where the problem starts and ends, gaming is kind of a social thing, not just a one-off event
[17:29:10] <Sadale> And if you want voicechat, I'm sorry. I can't do that except for Saturday 09:30-16:30 .
[17:29:22] <MootPoot> so its hard to really get into anything when the frequency is low
[17:29:39] <Sadale> I actually don't mind playing casual games one-off.
[17:29:48] <Sadale> It's just for pasttime
[17:30:06] <MootPoot> there are casual games but I dont know of any I guess- I typically only play full length games
[17:30:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, osu? wanna try it? :D
[17:31:07] <MootPoot> LOL - I  only played osu once a long time ago

[17:37:53] <Sadale> So whenever I step on the switch, the python script would simulate a keyboard keypress, which triggers voice chat unmute.

[18:12:05] <MootPoot> Lol
[18:12:08] <Sadale> MootPoot, And I falsely told him that I ran it and it fixed the permission issue. It scared the crap out of him. xD
[18:12:19] <MootPoot> I once got trolled by someone here 
[18:12:36] <Sadale> oh. What happened? :3 
[18:12:47] <MootPoot> Forget who..was trying to do some cli stuff on my Mac 
[18:13:06] <MootPoot> They told me some command that would destroy a core OS partition

[18:13:51] <Sadale> He better feel guilty. xD
[18:13:57] <MootPoot> So fortunately Apple already patched it and prevent the command from running 
[18:14:03] <Sadale> wow. lucky
[18:14:03] <MootPoot> So it didn't do anything 
[18:14:26] <Sadale> I actually find it sad when people make jokes like that to noobs
[18:14:30] <MootPoot> Apparently it used to in like 2009
[18:14:51] <Sadale> If you know that whoever asking for advise would get the joke, it's fine. But if not, you could be getting a noob into serious trouble
[18:14:56] <MootPoot> He came on like 30min later and told me not to run it
[18:15:05] <Sadale> lololololol

[18:17:43] <MootPoot> For some reason arch won't connect to my 3d printer over usb
[18:17:55] <Sadale> oh wow. How come?
[18:17:58] <MootPoot> Idk
[18:18:05] <Sadale> Have you upgraded your kernel or something? If so you need to reboot
[18:18:08] <MootPoot> So I just use the SD card
[18:18:18] <Bco1981> i like that everyone going about saying, linux is great you can customize it... HOWEVER... you want... every single time i try. it breaks.
[18:18:30] <Bco1981> sure is easy to customize.. yes.
[18:18:31] <Sadale> Try dmesg -w and attach the USB and see if you could see any meaningful debug message coming out

[18:19:10] <Sadale> As a desktop user I do find arch breaks from time to time. The desktop environment does have some bugs.
[18:19:16] <Sadale> The bugs come and go.

[18:19:36] <Sadale> It breaks in a way that it's still usable tho so I don't care. And I get to enjoy the latest software. :P
[18:19:53] <MootPoot> Bco1981: thats why you have a ButterNoodle you can call up and ask 
[18:19:54] <MootPoot> Lol
[18:20:18] <Bco1981> the problem then is he does not use debian... the most "stable" linux distro
[18:20:41] <MootPoot> Join the sexy back arch club 
[18:20:52] <Bco1981> debian is what i have had best experiences with.
[18:20:55] <Sadale> The problem of debian is that the packages are outdated af
[18:21:00] <Bco1981> less likely to break
[18:21:23] <Sadale> It works well as long as you stick with the packages provided by the package maintainer. However, if you find yourself having to use the latest version of the software, good luck with that.
[18:21:38] <Sadale> It's indeed less likely to break tho. So it's a trade-off.
[18:21:50] <Sadale> stability vs bleeding-edge
[18:23:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just wondering. Why do you pick arch?
[18:23:41] <Sadale> I picked it mainly because of latest software and it being highly customizable.
[18:24:23] <Bco1981> manjaro was actually not bad, for the time i tested it. didn't even break
[18:24:30] <Bco1981> almost got vr working
[18:25:12] <Sadale> ah linux and VR.

[19:01:10] <Sadale> I actually find it funny how you have to hire an accountant to do tax in the US
[19:01:17] <Sadale> Here the tax system's so simply that you could do that on your own
[19:01:22] <Sadale> s/simply/simple
[19:01:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol
[19:03:59] <Bco1981> MootPoot: if you look at the video i linked, it would answer your question :)
[19:04:04] <HeTo> here the government does the taxes for you. of course if there's income they don't know about or, more likely, tax breaks you're entitled to they don't automatically award to you, you can make corrections. even then you just tell them the basis for your taxes, the government calculates how much that is and will make the return or send you the bill
[19:04:25] <Sadale> very nice!
[19:05:05] <HeTo> anyway, the US system is like that because there's a lot of money involved in helping people make their taxes, either through services or by providing software, and the owners of these businesses make sure the government won't make it simpler
[19:07:43] <Nanobot> "Your federal refund so far: $4707" Oh you sweet, innocent TurboTax. You have no idea.

[20:12:10] <Bco1981> i don't know if this is possible with the US tax system, but. I usually over estimate, and pay more then need to during the year. then at the end of the year i always get tax returns.
[20:12:23] <Bco1981> i would rather get money, then get a "fine"
[20:12:59] <Nanobot> Bco1981: Yeah, that's what most people do, via withholdings. But I earned so much money from investments last year that withholdings didn't make a dent in the amount I owed.
[20:13:29] <Bco1981> ah, yeah investments aren't easy to estimate.
[20:13:59] <Nanobot> In the U.S., you're actually supposed to pay throughout the year (via "estimated tax" payments) if it's going to be over a certain mount, or else you'll owe an extra penalty when tax season comes.

[23:41:23] <Bco1981> like limiting it to 30fps or something ?
[23:41:24] <MootPoot> not sure, only really has issues with larger models
[23:41:30] <MootPoot> smaller ones are smooth
