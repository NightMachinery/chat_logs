[01:00:23] *** Quits: AmR (~AmREiSa@156.199.67.136) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:00:43] <ali1234> because i don't want to have to pass two separate arguments to the function that deal with it
[01:01:21] <cbreak> how about std::vector?
[01:01:22] <ali1234> i suppose i could make a macro like #define play_sound(x) real_play_sound(x, x_length)
[01:01:29] <ali1234> you like macros right? :P
[01:01:32] <cbreak> or a range?
[01:01:46] <cbreak> or define your own type for sound
[01:01:46] <ali1234> how would a range or vector help?
[01:01:55] <cbreak> vectors contain their length.
[01:02:04] <ali1234> yes, how do i define my own type that does this?
[01:02:08] <ali1234> within the standard
[01:02:37] <cbreak> struct X { size_t length; std::unique_ptr<T[]> data; }; // one example
[01:02:56] <ali1234> what will the pointer point to?
[01:03:04] <cbreak> template<typename T, size_t N> struct Y { T data[N]; }; // fully static
[01:03:23] <cbreak> ali1234: something allocated with new T[]
[01:03:38] <ali1234> if i use a template, what wll the declaration of the play_sound function look like?
[01:03:48] <cbreak> unique_ptr<T[]> will use delete[], unique_ptr<T> will use delete
[01:04:23] <cbreak> ali1234: template<typename T, size_t N> play(Y<T,N> const & y)
[01:04:25] <ali1234> there won't ever be any deleting. the data will be in read-only memory
[01:05:08] <cbreak> the size of any object of type T is known at compile time.
[01:05:17] <cbreak> that size is sizeof(T)
[01:05:27] <ali1234> hmm
[01:05:38] <ali1234> and that won't lead to multiple play functions being generated?
[01:05:44] <cbreak> it will.
[01:05:49] <ali1234> well that's no good then
[01:05:53] <cbreak> but you can call functions inside.
[01:06:04] <cbreak> for example one that takes the size as normal parameter.
[01:06:33] <ali1234> what are the chances the compiler is smart enough to optimize it out?
[01:06:41] <cbreak> ask godbolt :)
[01:06:52] <cbreak> you can also do the same trickery with arrays
[01:07:42] <cbreak> template<size_t N> void foo(uint8_t (& const data)[N]) { ... }
[01:08:08] <cbreak> ... not entirely sure about the syntax there though, arrays are annoying in parameter lists
[01:09:17] <ali1234> what if i put all the data in one big static array of known size, then in the sound effect object store pointers to the beginning and the end within that static array? will that be evaluated at compile time?
[01:09:50] <ali1234> const pointers of course
[01:11:15] <cbreak> that can also work.
[01:11:45] <cbreak> you'd only have to store beginnings though, since presumably the beginning of the next sound is the end of the one before. (apart from last one)

[01:12:43] <ali1234> well the goal is to not store anything in the executable and have the actual addresses used inline
[01:13:01] <cbreak> https://godbolt.org/z/7Th4r35v9
[01:13:41] <ali1234> that shows it got optimized out right?
[01:14:10] <cbreak> depends on what you mean
[01:14:34] <ali1234> in test, foo is called directly
[01:14:39] <cbreak> indeed it is.
[01:14:51] <cbreak> because indirection got inlined

[01:16:15] <ali1234> the final binary is what i care about. it has to fit in 64k flash including all the graphics, sound, music etc
[01:16:36] <cbreak> how much ram do you have? :)
[01:16:43] <ali1234> like half a megabyte
[01:16:54] <ali1234> but that includes the framebuffer which eats like half of it
[01:16:55] <cbreak> ok, then you can compress your stuff

[13:47:53] <teut> now I was the Task of a type which I want to pass at run time
[13:48:24] <teut> but to do that I will have to pass T everywhere to the Scheduler too
[13:49:27] <teut> this looks weird , I only want to initialize a Task of a type T.
[13:50:19] <teut> and then the Scheduler would also have to be initialized with T

[13:57:41] <Alipha> teut: what args would get passed to it when it's called?
[13:58:08] <teut> that would be decided at runtime
[13:59:03] <teut> it can be a lambda with 0 args
[13:59:14] <teut> or even with 1 arg or many arg
[13:59:16] <teut> s
[14:00:32] <Alipha> teut: So when you call callLater, at that point, you specify what args the lambda gets called with at the later time?
[14:00:40] <teut> yes
[14:01:12] <teut> in python you do not have to think about it since functions are first class objects
[14:03:55] <teut> templates provide static polymorphism and for dynamic polymorphism I should use a class and then subclasses?
[14:04:44] <Alipha> To achieve that, really, all you have to do is wrap your lambda in another lambda, instead of adding a T parameter to Task or mucking with polymorphism
[14:06:49] <Alipha> auto wrappedFunc = [=]() { func(args...); };
[14:06:50] <teut> [&](){   return [](int n){  fun(n) ;}  }?
[14:08:30] <Alipha> Yes, but you'll need [=] because the parameters of callLater aren't going to live until that lambda gets called, and so you'll need to copy them.
[14:12:24] <teut> https://github.com/Teut2711/Scheduler/blob/development/producerConsumer.cpp#L43
[14:12:53] <teut> do you remember my scheduler code from that day ?
[14:13:17] <teut> its same only and I am using the scheduler to run this producer consumer
[14:14:39] <teut> now in that line q.get    takes a lambda  with single argument   and this  lambda thus is not of type     std::function<void()>
[14:15:12] <teut> so it doesnt fit the callSoon's prototype
[14:18:00] <Alipha> Wouldn't you just do the same thing for callSoon? Wrap the lambda with the additional args?
[14:20:32] <teut> so call soon would  get    [&](){   return [](int n){  fun(n) ;}  }?
[14:20:52] <Alipha> template<typename... Args> void callSoon(Task func, Args... args) { ready.push([=]() { func(args...); }); }
[14:21:56] <Alipha> And you really need to think about and understand when you can use [&] and when you need to use [=].
[14:23:08] <teut> = looks like a better choice for now atleast since I am using int
[14:23:37] <Alipha> It doesn't matter if you're using int. It's the only choice here.
[14:24:02] <teut> <typename... Args>   is that ...Args  some syntax in c++ or you are just writing some pseudocode?

[14:25:14] <Alipha> func and args (the parameters to callSoon) die as soon as  callSoon ends. So they won't be alive for when you actually call the lambda from the ready queue. You NEED [=] so that you make copies of func and args. You can't have references to func and args

[18:40:33] <Alipha> `decltype(auto)` is a special usage of the decltype keyword and really has nothing to do with its normal usage. So, if a function returns auto, that means it's returning by value. If a function returns auto&, then it's returning an lvalue ref. If a function returns auto&&, then it's returning an rvalue ref. But now, in sine situations, you'd want to return either an lvalue ref or an rvalue ref, depending
[18:40:35] <Alipha> upon if your return statement is an lvalue ref or rvalue ref. That comes up most commonly when you use std::forward, eg, `return std::forward<T>(x);` You want to match the function's return type to match the type of x (whether x is an lvalue or rvalue ref). And so, decltype(auto) will do that. It'll be T& or T&& depending upon what x is.

[20:48:57] <teut> void AsyncQueue::get(const void(*)(int) callback) {
[20:49:14] <teut> how to write the pointer to the   `run` function?
[20:49:35] <teut> const void(*)(int) callback   is wrong
[20:53:39] *** Joins: MetaNova (~zero-one@znc/supporter/metanova)
[21:00:17] <Alipha> teut: um, you're really best off having get accept a std::function<void(int)>. Consumer::run is a a member function, and member function pointers are different from regular function pointers.
[21:00:51] <teut>  ;(  thats hard
[21:01:12] <Alipha> void AsyncQueue::get(void(Consumer::*callback)(int)) {   // and then `q.get(&Consumer::run);`, but i don't think you'll like this path
[21:01:12] <teut> I did look at the variac templates
[21:01:59] <Alipha> void AsyncQueue::get(void(*callback)(int)) {  // would be a regular function pointer, but that can't point to Consumer::run, unless Consumer::run is static
[21:02:50] <Alipha> why is void `AsyncQueue::get(std::function<void(int)> callback) {` hard?
[21:03:11] <teut> because for that I will have to change the scheduler
[21:03:30] <teut> or use variac templates which is a bad practice
[21:03:44] <teut> variadic templates.  this
[21:04:51] <Alipha> also, regarding your question about decltype(auto)....
[21:04:53] <Alipha> `decltype(auto)` is a special usage of the decltype keyword and really has nothing to do with its normal usage. So, if a function returns auto, that means it's returning by value. If a function returns auto&, then it's returning an lvalue ref. If a function returns auto&&, then it's returning an rvalue ref. But now, in sine situations, you'd want to return either an lvalue ref or an rvalue ref, depending
[21:04:55] <Alipha> upon if your return statement is an lvalue ref or rvalue ref. That comes up most commonly when you use std::forward, eg, `return std::forward<T>(x);` You want to match the function's return type to match the type of x (whether x is an lvalue or rvalue ref). And so, decltype(auto) will do that. It'll be T& or T&& depending upon what x is.
[21:06:36] <teut>  what's the difference between  value  and (lvalue and rvalue)
[21:06:38] <teut> ?
[21:08:11] <teut> ok ok , its just how to accept the result of the fuction
[21:08:30] <teut> int a or int &a or int && a
[21:08:55] <Alipha> right
[21:09:39] <teut> ya in the video they used std::forward too
