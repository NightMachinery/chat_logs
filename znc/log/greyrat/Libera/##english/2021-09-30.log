[00:17:22] <StayHungry> cousteau: also, anno Domini = not 'the year of the Lord', but 'in the year of the Lord'. you could say '9/11 happened anno 2001', anno = in the year, ablative case (more specifically, locative ablative) of annus (year). perhaps you, being Spaniard, heard the expression '1625. Annus Mirabilis Espanol', a marvellous year). another example: aestate (in summer) from aestas (summer).
[00:17:24] <bin> you've never heard "in the year of our lord" in movies?

[17:21:15] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: It's weird.
[17:21:27] <jaggz> GuiToris, not really.. the logic is flipped so it's implying something that's not said
[17:21:34] <kurahaupo> Its causality is backwards
[17:21:54] <jaggz> oh.. no it's just written weird.. it is used in some older english though
[17:22:10] <jaggz> "The fans fear that he will smoke for the negative impact it would have on his health"
[17:22:21] <jaggz> same thing
[17:22:27] <GuiToris> I stopped the music and reread this line, can you confirm this is trash too? "it's Lately it says this or an additional celebrity is gay, but now also speculate with anything halfway like whether or not Ville Valo is gay"
[17:22:28] <jaggz> but older english style
[17:22:46] <jaggz> is that random words? :)
[17:22:51] <kurahaupo> Why someone would choose to smoke because they know it will harm themselves is a mystery
[17:23:06] <GuiToris> jaggz, https://www.vooxpopuli.com/ville-valo/ville-valo-smoking/
[17:23:21] <jaggz> it's not so much a choice as a more carnal drive that bypasses logic and reasoning, kurahaupo 
[17:23:46] <kurahaupo> yeah it's just poorly passed
[17:23:56] <jaggz> then stupid logic and reasoning is layered on top, like "my neighbor's father smoked and live 'till he was 95.  His mother didn't smoke and died when she was 40."
[17:24:15] <kurahaupo> jaggz: I know. Which makes "because" all the more weird

[17:25:15] <jaggz> "I'm afraid of the dogs because they have powerful jaws."
[17:25:41] <jaggz> "The fans fear that he will smoke because they are concerned about the negative impact it would have on his health."

[17:26:13] <kurahaupo> "I'm afraid of dogs because I expect99,99 they will bite me" would be closer to the truth
[17:26:16] <jaggz> so that's why it's weird.. because the grammar does not make the subject/object clear in the second part I think

[17:26:31] *** Quits: iagmi (~m@8.21.8.252) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[17:26:41] <GuiToris> it's more like "I'm afraid of dogs because of the jet engines"
[17:26:50] <jaggz> so we don't know [to what] it applies when first reading it and have to put in effort once we hear the conflict in logic
[17:27:15] <jaggz> It's more complicated because they throw an action in the first part of the phrase
[17:27:36] <jaggz> "I"m afraid of smoking because of the health consequences." -- ok
[17:27:50] <kurahaupo> The thing is that "X fears that Y will" is not a literal statement about being afraid; rather it's a statement of expectation combined with disapproval
[17:27:58] <jaggz> "I"m afraid of him smoking because of the health consequences." -- hmm.. just starts getting strange.
[17:28:53] <kurahaupo> jaggz: So you're not afraid of him when he's not smoking? 😋
