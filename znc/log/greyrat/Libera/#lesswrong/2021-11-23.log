[00:19:34] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Bright’s design was deliberately fiendish. Even today, the paths are narrow and whirlpool-like, frequently sending visitors around in spiralling loops and depositing them at one node or another again and again, until they pick the route that releases them into the next part of the maze. Bright wanted to incorporate tunnels, to increase the complexity, but budgetary
[00:19:34] <feepbot> constraints forced him to settle for covered bridges. A sign at the mouth of the maze warns that it takes an average of forty-five minutes to complete, though “some never make it to the tower in the middle.” “It’s too clever by half,” Fisher told me. “It’s very angry, very hostile.” It wasn’t long before Longleat started getting complaints from guests whose visits
[00:19:34] <feepbot> had extended well past the point of amusement. The staff installed clue stations: directional arrows each covered by small metal panels labelled “Lift if Lost.” Eventually, Longleat turned to Fisher for advice on how to make the experience more enjoyable. By then, Bright had made himself unavailable. Having arguably triggered a global maze renaissance, he had turned his
[00:19:40] <feepbot> attention to paper mazes, creating increasingly confusing designs that he accompanied with comments like “Solving the mazes is of little significance” and “I do not expect you to do this one.” He turned down lucrative maze commissions, including one from Disney. Then, in 1979, he disappeared, never to build or publish a maze again.'
[00:24:35] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Fisher had added another layer of ambiguity, by placing a number of identical square wrought-iron pergolas at four-way junctions. “If the design has more than one of these, you may mistakenly think you’re in the same place, when in fact you’re in a different place,” Fisher warned, as we emerged from a hedge corridor and encountered one. Because the paths to the
[00:24:35] <feepbot> pergolas meet at right angles, and because Escot’s maze is square, people arriving at a pergola tend to assume that its edges are parallel to those of the maze. They are unlikely to suspect that the pergola is one of five, positioned in pentagonal symmetry around the center of the maze—an orientation inherently confounding to our anatomically derived propensity to think in
[00:24:35] <feepbot> terms of forward, backward, left, and right. Even aspirants who happen to know that there are five pergolas have to remember not just which of the three other paths they have chosen before but which one of the twenty such choices they face in total.' very nice
[00:29:35] <feepbot> <gwern> 'As I watched tiny humans filmed by the drone make exactly the same mistakes that I had, I recalled that a German word for maze, der Irrgarten, translates as “error garden,” and that, during the first golden age of hedge mazes, they were often positioned beneath terraces or high windows, so that spectators could savor the confusion of others.'
[00:31:18] <catern> these sound like fun mazes, I'd like to do a hedge maze
[00:31:28] <catern> reminds me of an escape room
[00:31:39] <catern> that is, a physical escape room
[00:36:40] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Fisher is in many respects interested in his projects only while they are still unrealized designs—Escot’s owners were left to plant all its beech trees. Nonetheless, solving the challenges faced by maze managers, like hedge maintenance, customer throughput, and budget balancing, is at least as fascinating to Fisher as creating puzzles for public enjoyment. Not that he
[00:36:40] <feepbot> gets it right every time. As he gleefully ignored his G.P.S. on the way home, squeezing into the inside lane to sail past traffic, he told me that his most recent maze, in Ningbo, despite being the world’s largest, was not tough enough. “I was frightened that it was too big,” he said. “But the Chinese are utterly driven.”' <-- he forgot to set the difficulty level to
[00:36:40] <feepbot> 'Asian'
[00:41:40] <feepbot> <gwern> '[Yudkowsky][23:05] so I can imagine scenarios where some version of GPT-5 cloned outside OpenAI is able to talk hundreds of millions of mentally susceptible people into giving away lots of their income, and many regulatory regimes are unable to prohibit this effectively. then AI could be making a profit of trillions and then people would invest corresponding amounts in

[00:54:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Mouthfeel + sweet + a tiny note of scent = enough to make it taste good

[00:59:48] <ggreer> I have not. I assume they're going to be convicted of murder

[01:02:54] <ggreer> I don't need to watch it. I know the defense tried to use certain interpretations of the law that allow citizen's arrest and the judge told them they couldn't. so it's gonna be murder

[01:04:09] <ggreer> yeah the prosecution isn't going to compromise so the defense had to try a hail mary. it failed. they're fucked
[01:04:53] <kuudes> we have now decided that likely starting from next saturday we will take the 6-year old off from daycare/preschool until january. in any case she would be off from there the week after christmas, so this is 4 weeks. we will care for her at home, my wife remotes 2 days per week and is off 1 day per week and I remote 5 days a week. also my mother has promised to care for at least 1 day per week and we will hire our regular babysitter for as many days as she 
[01:04:53] <kuudes> can give that time.
[01:05:02] <kuudes> 9-year old will still go to school given she now has likely 3 doses and wife will continue work as described - she has already an air scrubber at work and uses ffp2 mask and eats alone in her office
[01:05:11] <kuudes> EMA has signalled it will make its decision on 5-11 yo vaccines on this friday, and the national vaccination expert group will have its meeting wed 1.12. the government cabinet has its meeting in thursday 2.12 and could maybe decide on altering the vaccination statute then. the yellow capped kids doses have been talked of arriving perhaps by christmas eve, but presumably after the statute change it might be possible to get an altered dose for a child with 
[01:05:11] <kuudes> a prescription, so it seems possible 6 yo could get her second dose in december.
[01:05:13] <two2thehead> dec, jan, feb is winter iirc
[01:05:20] <kuudes> in any case I hope during december it will calm down and start head down again, even if the local authorities take no or little actions tomorrow meeting
[01:05:26] <kuudes> inputs and points of views are appreciated?
[01:05:47] <two2thehead> you seem to have most of the bases covered :-)
[01:06:03] <kuudes> thanks
[01:06:35] <two2thehead> Is there a measure of time between new-dose-available to dose-administration? That could be a measure of how protected you are.
[01:06:38] <ggreer> if you're under 18, your covid risk is basically zero, right?

[01:07:52] <ggreer> dv^_^: in georgia and most states, you can't engage in a citizen's arrest (eg: pursue a fleeing suspect) unless you personally see the person committing a felony. the defendants already admitted they didn't actually see arbery do anything that time, so there is absolutely no legal justification for brandishing weapons while pursuing him
[01:08:13] <ggreer> that said, arbery was almost certainly trying to steal stuff
[01:08:48] <ggreer> but the whole point of human rights is that they apply to everyone. you can't just go vigilante on some random criminal
[01:10:47] <gwern> well, they apply to everyone, except criminals

[01:20:16] <kuudes> two2thehead, well, if the vaccination of children would optimistically get legal in 2021-12-02 government cabinet meeting, it has been said that in any case first yellow capped kids pfizer bottles arrive little before christmas eve
[01:20:56] <kuudes> but it could be possible to get child vaccinated with prescription with partial dose from pfizer adult blue cap bottle, you just need to load a one third dose from it

[01:42:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So, twitter shortens links, right? So the way they've got it is, it's an <a> tag. The href is to a URL-shortener-service URL. The displayed text, i.e. the text content of the <a>, is a truncated version of the "actual" URL. Within the <a> tag are <span>s which contain the truncated-off parts of the true URL, and are hidden. When you hover over the hyperlink, you get a *custom*, JS-provided popup taking the place of the
[01:42:19] <Obormot\Arcturus>  ordinary tooltip, wherein the full "actual" URL is reconstructed and shown to you (so it looks like you're seeing the URL the link will take you to - which you're not, of course)

[02:21:12] <ggreer> twitter has to work on a shitload of different platforms. you can still use sms to tweet. the twitter website still works on the nintendo ds
[02:21:27] <ggreer> so they tend to fall back to lowest common denominator shit like short links

[02:37:01] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I'm reading a book on the Stasi. I have to say, the sheer 'efficacy' of the East Germans is quite something. One thing I was impressed upon while reading, was how 'ordered' their intelligence gathering was. Not just in terms of SIGINT, but also how at the lower end, officers were expected to have around ten or so informers, and at least one safehouse at all times to debrief them. I wonder if the CIA was/is analogous in their 
[02:37:01] <two2thehead> operations?
[02:37:18] <two2thehead> And I still haven't mentioned how the informers have various categories

[06:17:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, like, the Corolla gets ~30 mpg ... on the low end. That's, like, urban driving etc. 13 gallon fuel tank capacity. Costs ~$45 to fill. So a full tank gets me 400-ish miles, minimum (more like 500+ on the highway)
[06:17:24] <adiabatic> I could probably get by for a VERY long time with only 110 chargers in my garage if I ever got an EV
[06:18:15] <ggreer> eventually batteries will get cheaper and EVs will go downmarket. fundamentally they're simpler devices. they use fixed speed transmissions. there are no fuel injectors. no air intakes. no exhaust systems. no accessory belts. no crankcase ventilation. no catalytic converter. and so on
[06:18:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: https://chargehub.com/en/countries/united-states/new-york/brooklyn.html - what does "level 2" vs. "level 3" mean here

[06:18:50] <ggreer> charging speed. level 2 is 220V and up to 50 amps (10kW-ish)
[06:19:00] <ggreer> level 3 is fast DC charging (250kW+)
[06:20:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> So in my part of Brooklyn there are 0 level 3 stations, and 2 level 2 stations...

[06:21:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Both like a 20 minute drive away... very inconvenient
[06:21:15] <ggreer> you don't charge at charging stations unless you're on a road trip
[06:21:25] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: is there anything at that 20-minutes-away location that you'd want to shop at?
[06:21:27] <ggreer> you plug your car in at home and wake up every day with a full tank of gas
[06:22:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: not really
[06:22:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: I live in an apartment so... no, lol
[06:22:23] <ggreer> extension cords are a thing
[06:22:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... extension cords out the window, through the back yard, down the alley, down the block, across the street, down another block...?
[06:23:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't be silly
[06:23:12] <ggreer> you only have street parking? sad!
[06:23:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, street parking is the norm for apartment buildings around here
[06:24:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's the occasional basement garage or w/e but it's not the modal scenario
[06:24:34] <adiabatic> there's an L3 by me but I don't go shopping there for that long
[06:25:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, I dunno, I guess owning an EV might become a halfway-reasonable thing at some point, but it sure ain't there yet
[06:25:51] <ggreer> around 2/3rds of homes (not houses, homes) in the US have garages or carports. most condos and apartment complexes assigned parking
[06:25:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> *around here
[06:26:00] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[06:26:09] <adiabatic> if I shopped at any of the local Walmarts I could charge there, but I don't
[06:26:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> All I can say is what's true where I live, other places don't really concern me
[06:27:34] <ggreer> at first I was worried about charging and range, but after a road trip last winter I lost that worry. the only way you'll get stranded in a tesla is if you do so deliberately. there are chargers everywhere

[06:43:34] <saturn2> i wonder if gas cars will keep being a thing in the east coast long after everyone else has switched, simply because there's not enough space to put chargers
[06:44:22] <saturn2> maybe the boring company will build subterranian charging dungeons
[06:44:33] <gwern> probably. people like obormot are pretty locked into their current gas-centric infrastructure
[06:44:57] <gwern> and electric cars may have cost advantages but probably never enough to convince people to switch over to on-demand rental e-cars
[06:47:13] <ggreer> I could see lots of level 1 & 2 chargers getting installed in parking spots
[06:48:53] <gwern> that's a huge amount of capital and ongoing maintenace costs compared to 'an empty street spot'
[06:49:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> The fact that it takes 5 minutes to fill up a car with gas but god knows how long to charge a battery ... is a pretty big deal
[06:49:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you could charge as quickly as a gas fill-up, then gas stations could start installing chargers
[06:49:52] <gwern> no, even if you imagine carbon taxes and pollution taxes stacked on each other, you'll be seeing gas cars for a very long time to come
[06:50:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I also think so
[06:50:50] <ggreer> I think they'll be around for another decade or so. after that they'll be a rarity kinda like seeing an old volkswagen beetle or something
[06:50:52] <gwern> they'll increasingly be curiosities, sort of like land lines. but filling many roles
[06:51:57] <Obormot_\Gaia> Everyone I know has a landline
[06:52:01] *** Obormot_\Gaia is now known as Obormot\Gaia
[06:52:31] <Obormot\Gaia> I mean, you get it for like an extra $5 a month if you have cable internet, or if you have DSL it's a prerequisite, obviously
[06:52:33] <gwern> well, why wouldn't they? the landlines are already installed and functional. they'll be there forever
[06:52:38] <ggreer> it doesn't make much sense for gas stations to install chargers. gas stations have to worry about fires and toxins. you put chargers in parking lots 
[06:52:53] <gwern> if you're making a new home, on the other hand, it's less clear how much you want to bother
[06:53:03] <Obormot\Gaia> ggreer: Right, well, parking in parking lots isn't really common around here
[06:53:46] <gwern> chargers are the worst of both worlds: too slow to support necessary throughput in gas stations, but too expensive to just put in every possible parking spot
[06:54:38] <gwern> if they were fast and expensive, you could just swap gas stations over, selling electrons intstead of hydrocarbons; if they were slow and cheap, you could put them in enough spaces in random places that people could charge up while grazing, as it were. but slow and expensive?
[06:55:18] <ggreer> how much does a level 1 or 2 charger actually cost? it's probably around the cost of asphalt for the area of the spot
[06:55:43] <ggreer> it's the fast DC chargers that are actually expensive
[06:56:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> A plan to put anything all over the sidewalks in NYC isn't going to get a lot of traction
[06:57:21] <PlanckWalk> I guess they never had (or got rid of) parking meters per spot?
[06:57:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Got rid of, yes, replacing them with ticket dispensers which are not per-spot
[06:58:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway the places where you had meters are precisely the places where you *can't* park for many hours straight
[06:58:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Obviously)
[07:00:54] <PlanckWalk> True.  I've never really lived anywhere with high enough density that each dwelling didn't have parking associated with it.
[07:02:07] <PlanckWalk> Likewise most places I've worked either had their own parking or had multi-storey parking not far away.
