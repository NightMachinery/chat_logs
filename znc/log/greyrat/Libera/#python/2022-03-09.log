[00:15:59] <exarkun> By the naming, I'll go out on a limb and guess that performance_df is a DataFrame

[00:17:12] <exarkun> I mean that's one way you can handle it.  Stop having 0s.
[00:17:17] <mike18> dont do the division?
[00:17:19] <jinsun> you could ignore the warning too if you are fine with having inf or NaN in your result
[00:17:24] <exarkun> That's another way, sure.
[00:17:38] <mike18> whats the suggested why - if i cant control the input?

[00:20:08] <parv> SnoopJ, Are you passing the result of the program elsewhere which cannot deal with strings longer than MAXWIDTH?

[00:21:35] <exarkun> There are some floating point flags that you can twiddle to control the behavior of exceptional cases on floating point operations.  I don't remember if there's something you can fiddle to get 0 instead of nan, but you could look for that, I guess.

[01:46:39] <dignissimus> I asked a very similar question recently, you can get the directory your python script is in, using pathlib.Path and __file__
[01:47:16] <coc0nut> i mean i can see its a good thing to be like that, but maybe be easier if you didnt need to? :p

[01:52:37] <fofoni> hi all! does anybody know if aiohttp behaves any differently when inside a docker container?

[01:53:48] *** Quits: rickybob (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:53:59] <fofoni> my app behaves just fine outside the container, but it can't make external requests when inside, it fails with ClientConnectorError: Cannot connect to host localhost:8000
[01:54:11] <ChrisWarrick> fofoni: external requests to localhost?
[01:54:23] <ChrisWarrick> fofoni: what is localhost:8000 supposed to be?
[01:54:28] <fofoni> "external" here means "to outside the container"

[01:58:25] <fofoni> also, since we're here, another difference in behaviour is that when I run the app outside the container, aiohttp prints logs to the terminal (sometimes with tracebacks when exceptions escape the handlers)
[01:59:33] <fofoni> when inside the container, the docker logs don't usually show aiohttp's regular logs, but they do show the traceback when there are errors

[07:00:41] <maxtim> I wrote a library of classes and functions that I use very often. Currently, I have the file in ~/shared. I was looking at how other libraries are imported and I see that there is a directory ~/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages. I assume these are installed via pip. What is required to add direcories there? Do I have to install via pip in order to import libraries from .local/lib?
[07:01:13] <SnoopJ> maxtim, it sounds like you would be well-served by making a package out of your classes/functions and installing that, yes.
[07:01:55] <maxtim> SnoopJ, can I just copy my directory there and import it to my python scripts?

[08:36:40] <llanhmod> I hope I explained that correctly....this is confusing somewhat. psycopg3 is out and I cannot use it until psycopg2 is removed ( iguess)

[10:04:05] <jinsun> muuo: it says to open the file with newline='', which you can't do for stdout I guess, but that is required only for handling newlines embedded inside quoted fields, which are uncommon, so might get away with not doing that

[12:45:12] <supakeen> The reasoning behind this is that a sudo pip/setup.py will install dependencies globally and provide them globally.
[12:45:32] <supakeen> This is problematic as you might/will have other software with the same dependencies on perhaps different incompatible versions.
[12:45:57] <flower_> for packages on debian, statically linking is not allowed right?
[12:46:02] <supakeen> Global packages should only be installed by your distros package manager, user installed, sure one can use pip for that. Development uses virtual environment.
[12:46:08] <supakeen> Your package would not be statically built no.
[12:46:24] <supakeen> But you can provide a statically built binary for users to download and put in their ~/bin if they prefer.

[12:53:11] <vladoski> can't really understand why a dict like foo = {'asd', 'foo', []} can't be typed as dict[str, Union[str, list[Any]]]
[12:53:37] <vladoski> mypy tells me to do it like dict[str, Sequence[str]]
[12:54:21] <tvm> apparently standard row "popping" isn't a thing with dataframes, and "if then asignment" they do in their examples doesn't actually returns anything and seems like in-place operation :|
[12:55:53] <BrenBarn> if you want to assign a flag, you can do something like `df['FlagColumn'] = my_condition`, where `my_condition` is the condition you would use in `df[my_condition]` to select the rows you want

[12:56:24] <The-Compiler> fair
[12:56:34] <supakeen> But yea, the syntax is wrong :)
[12:56:39] <BrenBarn> i.e., something like `df['FlagColumn'] = (df.SomeCol < 10) & (df.OtherCol == 'whatever')`
[12:57:24] <BrenBarn> or if you want to remove those rows, you can select the rows using the negation of your condition
[12:58:07] <tvm> hmm, FlagColumn here is what type though ? your expression on the right is conditional
[12:58:17] <tvm> and returns no value
[12:58:34] <The-Compiler> vladoski: but if you mean something like   {'a': 'asd', 'b': 'foo', 'c': []}  then that surely can be annotated as   dict[str, Union[str, list[Any]]]   so I guess your real code is something entirely different

[13:18:54] <fakenullie> it tries to figure most specific common type, that's why it inferes Sequence[str]
[13:19:15] <fakenullie> because it works for both str, and list[str]

[16:41:56] <WhiteKarura> Greetings fellow programmers! I needed some advice regarding the protection of code on GitHub. I intend to publish one of my hobby projects which has grown substantially beyond my belief. However, I do not want people to simply download it as a zip file, make slight changes and post it as their own projects. What preemptive measures can I take to
[16:41:57] <WhiteKarura> prevent people from plagiarizing my code as their own? I'm really new to open source and not sure what to do...
[16:41:57] <WhiteKarura> (I want to make it clear that it's completely fine if they use it for their own, non-commercial purposes. Just crediting me would be fine if they ever intend to publish their code, and have used my packages & libraries. However, I'm pretty much against modifying code that I had initially written)
[16:42:10] <noent> alright. I might port that to a debian package and deploy it for my machines. Ty, grawity
[16:42:26] <Deneb> I ask because dpkg reports that python3-dbg is already installed.

[19:19:11] <SnoopJ> Guest20, you can ship your PyInstaller application with only the compiled bytecode and not the source, if that meets your needs. It can get a little messy when you need to collect data/binary files from your dependencies, but it's the lowest-hanging fruit here. It also offers functionality to wrap that bytecode in a layer of on-disk encryption, which prevents casual snooping by disassembly of the
[19:19:13] <SnoopJ> bytecode.
[19:19:39] <SnoopJ> but your best bet for protecting against reverse engineering is a feature called a "lawyer" ;)

[20:30:00] <SnoopJ> it's worth pointing out that `pre=True` happens before any transformation, so if you had a validator that needed the raw data, this is a way to implement that

[21:11:49] <exarkun> lesshaste: Well, timedelta has subtraction implemented on it, so you would do it by representing your values as timedeltas and then using the - operator.

[21:14:14] <jinsun> you can subtract datetime objects but not time, subtracting times without date part can be ambiguous
[21:14:15] <exarkun> datetime.time is a weird type, basically
[21:14:28] <lesshaste> ah... hmm
[21:14:30] <exarkun> Someone decided that it is only an ordinal type for certain operations
[21:14:37] <lesshaste> I make it using  start = datetime.strptime(start, '%H:%M')
[21:14:42] <exarkun> It doesn't really matter if that makes sense, since that's just the way it is.
[21:14:43] <lesshaste> where start is a string
[21:14:53] <lesshaste> what is the simplest way to get this to work?
[21:15:24] <jinsun> are you trying to measure time taken for something?
[21:15:44] <exarkun> Yes.  Tell us what you're trying to do.
[21:15:54] <SnoopJ> lesshaste, subtraction is meaningful between date objects and between datetime objects
[21:15:55] <lesshaste> yes I want to know how long between the start and stop and then add that to another time
[21:16:18] <exarkun> Why are you trying to do this on just the time component?
[21:16:36] <SnoopJ> (but only when you have two of the same class, it's not meaningful across the class boundary, i.e. date - datetime or vice versa is not defined)

[21:17:29] <lesshaste> I want to add up the number of hours I have worked
[21:17:40] <lesshaste> but I need to subtract off lunch breaks
[21:17:44] <lesshaste> that's what the code is meant to do
[21:17:57] <jinsun> you can do (stop - start).time()
[21:18:07] <jinsun> not stop.time() - start.time()
[21:18:24] <exarkun> because datetime.datetime instances can be subtracted from each other
[21:18:32] <exarkun> bit you don't get a datetime back, you get a timedelta
[21:18:35] <exarkun> s/bit/but/
[21:18:40] <jinsun> oh no you can't .time after subtracting
[21:18:51] <exarkun> Still, that gives you the information you want.
[21:18:52] <jinsun> you can get the total seconds from that though
[21:18:54] <lesshaste> 'datetime.timedelta' object has no attribute 'time'
[21:18:57] <SnoopJ> right, because the resulting quantity is a duration, not a time

[21:19:28] <dignissimus> Three questions, the first two are about pypi. How does versioning work? When I commit to VCS does that do anything to what's on pypi? And if I upload to pypi without changing the version string, what happens?

[21:20:28] <dignissimus> Final question, I know have `pip install` setup and the program installs correctly. How should I setup configuration files? Before they were in the same directory as when `git clone` was performed but I don't know if that's still appropriate
[21:20:30] <exarkun> lesshaste: datetime - datetime = timedelta; datetime + timedelta = datetime; datetime - timedelta = datetime

[21:21:21] <dignissimus> The people using the software aren't programmers, I really want it to be as easy to use as possible but also configurable for sysadmins if they set it up for other people in an organisation (it's a web server)
[21:21:26] <jinsun> lesshaste: you can do (stop - start).total_seconds() and compare that with another number
[21:21:42] <jinsun> 3600 if you want 2 hours
[21:21:53] <jinsun> 3600 * 2
[21:22:38] <exarkun> dignissimus: PyPI and your version control system are typically independent.  There are systems for integrating them (various kinds of "continuous release" workflow).
[21:22:56] <dignissimus> Thsnk you, that makes sense
[21:22:58] <exarkun> dignissimus: PyPI will not let you upload a new artifact with the same identifier as an existing artifact.
[21:23:06] <dignissimus> Oh, great!
[21:23:28] <dignissimus> I very much see myself making that mistake in the future XD
[21:23:58] <exarkun> dignissimus: "How should I setup configuration files?" probably depends a lot on your application and deployment targets.
[21:24:37] <exarkun> dignissimus: If you have configuration files that the end user is meant to modify, you probably want them to end up in a platform-appropriate directory.
[21:24:48] <exarkun> dignissimus: https://pypi.org/project/appdirs/ may help with this
[21:24:55] <jinsun> dignissimus: which also means you have to be careful about uploading to pypi, once something goes there it will be very hard to get it removed

[23:20:29] <jinsun> oh no, the good solution would have been to not use it and use requests instead, then you could have verify=False
[23:21:03] <POGtastic> Silly question: Is there a way to refer to any object's __call__ method as a function? For example, suppose a function iterate(lambda f: f(), obj) where obj is some callable. Is it possible to replace the lambda with some superclass.__call__?
[23:21:47] *** Joins: fofoni (~fofoni@user/fofoni)
[23:21:55] <SnoopJ> POGtastic, you can do `someobj.__call__` to get a reference to that object's instance method, if that's what you're asking?
[23:22:48] <POGtastic> SnoopJ: The issue is that I don't know what exact type `someobj` is going to be.
[23:22:49] <lesshaste> exarkun, oh that's better! thanks
[23:23:06] <SnoopJ> POGtastic, it doesn't matter
[23:23:21] <SnoopJ> or at least, if it matters to your question, it isn't clear _why_
[23:23:21] <lambda> POGtastic: if it's callable, it has a .__call__ method, that's what makes it a callable
[23:23:51] <jinsun> you can just replace lambda f: f() with f
[23:24:46] <fofoni> hey, looks like Python ships with a module called "packaging", but it's not documented?
