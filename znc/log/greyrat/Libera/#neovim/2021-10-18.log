[00:33:11] <kylo252[m]> in the worst case scenario, a sensitive linting configuration will throw X number of debug warnings that you don't even care about. 
[00:33:11] <kylo252[m]> keep in mind that at the end of day, you're not giving back that memory back with that filter function, regardless how many errors we're talking about here

[03:28:01] <mh72[m]> Would anyone know the following regarding lspconfig? I am trying to have neovim not show linting errors such as when I use 'import pandas', not to show "pandas not accessed" when I don't use it. I have tried different things, such as setting "	"reportUnusedImport": "none"," in my pyrightconfig.json (and when I inspect the lsp.log, it says it's using that config file) as well as the following in my config:

[03:28:19] <mh72[m]> but noone of these seem to be effective
[03:29:07] <mh72[m]> The latter I got from a suggestion on github at https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/441

[03:34:55] <wbthomason[m]> <d34df00d> "I've looked at https://github...." <- lsp-status just sets a variable for inclusion in a status line. I'm also not sure it should be considered an example of Lua plugin best practices anymore; the ecosystem and APIs are very different now than they were when I wrote that
[03:35:30] <wbthomason[m]> <mjlbach[m]> "I guess one option, I haven't..." <- Could you give an example of the meta-group UX you want? I think this is already possible, but I'm not entirely clear on what you're trying to do
[03:36:13] <mjlbach[m]> wbthomason[m]: Sure, mostly I want to install something like `mjlbach/lspeasy.git` with packer, but then when that is installed, internally in the plugin declare dependencies for packer to install
[03:36:21] <mjlbach[m]> so instead of having users add nvim-cmp, the plugin does it for them
[03:36:54] <mh72[m]> mjlbach:  Alright will do, thank you. Btw, thanks so much for all your work on lsp in neovim, such a tremenduous pleasure to work with. I use it every day now as well as your defaults nvim config. Slow switching my workflow from emacs to neovim when it comes to coding. 
[03:37:05] <mjlbach[m]> That's wonderful :) 
[03:37:17] <mjlbach[m]> I can look into it

Tbh all packer work right now is slow because I'm just trying to climb out from under all the existing issue reports, etc., which eats up all my maintenance time these days.

[03:37:25] <mh72[m]> I think your files and Henrik's Doom are the ones I consult most!

[03:37:53] <mjlbach[m]> just trying to address the reddit crowd
[03:39:12] <wbthomason[m]> mjlbach[m]: Ah, gotcha - right now this is possible if you run install again after the initial installation (b/c packer doesn't check for new things to install after loading an installed plugin - this would be easy and useful to add, though), just by calling packer.use within some runtime-sourced file in your plugin
[03:39:24] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah exactly ^^^
[03:39:49] <mjlbach[m]> > just by calling packer.use within some runtime-sourced file in your plugin

[03:48:33] <mjlbach[m]> gpanders: do you find it kinda weird that opts.severity only lets you select a single severity value?
[03:48:46] <mjlbach[m]> so you can do underline.severity = 3 but not underline.severity = {1,2,3}?

[03:56:31] <mjlbach[m]> and also the update_in_insert is unnecessary
[03:56:58] <mjlbach[m]> You can play around with HINT, INFO, WARN, and ERROR to see the minimum level that's right for you
[03:57:52] <mjlbach[m]> pyright sends these as "hint" so you can do INFO instead of what I pasted above

[13:10:37] <swimmer> hmm all in a sudden the entries in my nvim-cmp popup window are coloured. Did I miss something?
[13:11:13] <clason[m]> yep, they implemented a new PUM based on floating windows
[13:12:34] <swimmer> but that's already in place since a couple of weeks isn't it?
[13:13:30] <clason[m]> not sure; I lose track of time easily...

[13:43:27] <swimmer> hrsh7th[m]: thanks for chiming in 👍 I didn't feel the need to create an issue - I was just surprised to see it all in a sudden and was wondering whether others experience the same.

[13:54:51] <swimmer> and if I use another colorscheme it looks really nice! Thanks for all your efforts 🙏
[14:03:40] <phaazon[m]> I just realised that Hop colors are not the default ones when using edge, the colorscheme
[14:04:10] <phaazon[m]> And I saw they added support for Hop directly in the colorscheme 😱
[14:04:25] <phaazon[m]> Hop is more famous than I thought lol
[14:06:40] <BorweBrianOrwe[m> Was :Explore and 😖explore removed from neovim 0.5.1+ or something?

[14:09:26] <BorweBrianOrwe[m> Yeah I added nvim-tree, but can't figure out for the life of me how to use it LOL. could it be somehow removing those commands?

[18:08:55] <saltrocklamp[m]> my question was: is there some way to "pin" the window on the bottom (which already as `winfixheight` set) such that commands like `<c-w> _` leave it as-is, while modifying the other windows as normal?

[18:09:43] <saltrocklamp[m]> or would i have to have an autocmd that re-positions and re-sizes the window whenever something tries to change its size?

[18:18:25] <rostero> I'm using lsp(config) with treesitter.  for the first couple of saves everything is fine, but after a while i'll create a syntax error.  then neovim just shows a bunch of errors, even on those lines i corrected.  it's like it doesn't get re-run.  i have to quit nvim and restart.
[18:18:28] <rostero> any ideas?
[18:20:34] <clason[m]> needs a minimal reproducing example (including -- but not limited to -- the exact server and tree-sitter parser)
[18:21:12] <rostero> good point.  typescript's tserver.  i'll see if i can get that
[18:22:02] <Julian> rostero: IME that usually means your parser is out of date and neovim gets confused with a query or something -- so you could try `:TSUpdate tsx` or whichever before trying to put together a MWE
[18:22:17] <rostero> typescript-language-server actually
[18:22:52] <rostero> I got parsers are up to date, and the errors persist
[18:22:52] <clason[m]> vi
[18:23:17] <clason[m]> and you cannot reproduce without tree-sitter?
[18:23:43] <rostero> i haven't tried
[18:24:38] <clason[m]> well, that would be the first thing, then, right?

[18:27:11] <rostero> i created a syntax error.  i got 150 errors, which i corrected, but it was still showing 150 errors.  I typed :LspRestart and all the errors went away and lsp is running normally.
[18:27:48] <tj_allemaal> hey guys, i’m trying to establish a workflow to compile latex documents in neovim. so far my minimal example works. other examples don’t . i’m using vimtex also. where do i put additional packages? does vimtex have to load the packages, or is it latexmk? … i just wann add packages and see if that’s the reason some tex file dont compile. cheers
[18:28:16] <clason[m]> you should best ask that at #vimtex-chat_community:gitter.im 
[18:28:29] <tj_allemaal> woah 
[18:28:32] <tj_allemaal> k thx
[18:28:42] <clason[m]> (vimtex uses `kpsewhere`, so anywhere latex looks, vimtex does)

[18:43:15] <saltrocklamp[m]> rostero: that happens to me sometimes, it seems like the tree sitter state just breaks after a while and the buffer needs to be reloaded. i haven't been able to construct a MWE or reliably reproduce, not sure if it's just tree sitter or some interaction between tree sitter and LSP

[18:54:41] <yetitwo[m]> i'm using coc-eslint with a dark theme in neovim, and when it highlights an error, it uses this eye-bleeding red: 
[18:54:51] <drewolson> having the provider generally enabled _massively_ slows down opening even empty python files
[18:54:55] <yetitwo[m]> which setting changes that highlight color?
[18:55:53] <yetitwo[m]> so far i've tried a bunch of the `:hi Coc*` settings and `:hi Pmenu`

[19:00:51] <mrchu001[m]> the actual reference to where it's used is in "./apps/webapp/src/app/app.tsx"

[19:13:32] <mjlbach[m]> Ok, so with the default root pattern of lspconfig it doesn't get the monorepo root right, there's not a good way to distinguish in this case IMO
[19:13:42] <mjlbach[m]> But I've reproduced your issue
[19:15:28] <mjlbach[m]> So it's definitely the server

[19:39:03] <sim[m]> mjlbach one thing I forgot when you asked about the lsp stuff, will the file watcher thingies be implemented? They're pretty useful in web dev/flutter projects 
[19:39:16] <mjlbach[m]> Sure, client-side?
[19:39:24] <mjlbach[m]> You can making a tracking issue

[19:40:02] <mrchu001[m]> If anything it feels great to know I'm not crazy lol
[19:40:03] <sim[m]> mjlbach[m]: Yeah some servers support it 
[19:40:13] <sim[m]> mjlbach[m]: Alright I'll do that
[19:40:31] <mjlbach[m]> But yes, I've wanted to do file watcher support for awhile
[19:40:41] <mjlbach[m]> there was discussion whether or not to make it require an external plugin though
[19:40:47] <mjlbach[m]> because watchman is the best choice
[19:40:47] <sim[m]> I'm pretty sure libuv can do the filesystem watching so cross platform shouldn't be an issue 
[19:40:51] <mjlbach[m]> otherwise we'd have to write a ton of stuff with luv
[19:41:07] <mjlbach[m]> luv can but there are a ton of limitations around remote files/mounts
[19:41:46] <sim[m]> Ah, then we can have an external plugin till it's stable enough to move it into core if needed

[19:46:49] <mjlbach[m]> (all the best ofc :) )
[19:47:01] <Mathias[m]> I was just thinking about the file watching stuff again today (have been switching branches a lot today and got annoyed by LSP not refreshing correctly without me opening some files manually) 
[19:47:01] <Mathias[m]> I think using luv as a start could be an option - degrade to not having the functionality if there is remote fs involved or something like that
[19:47:45] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah
[19:47:57] <mjlbach[m]> I think we should do luv in core, but have it pluggable so watchman can drop in and provide elevated functionality
[19:48:40] <sim[m]> What does vscode use? Watchman or their own api
[19:48:45] <mjlbach[m]> but sim it's entirely possible due to the built-in client model to have a filewatcher plugin
[19:49:00] <mjlbach[m]> they use a javascript filewatcher with optional watchman support AFAIk
[19:49:01] <mjlbach[m]> s/AFAIk/AFAIK/
[19:49:21] <mjlbach[m]> so we'd basically do the same but using luv (which is what the JS filewatcher uses I think, libuv primitives)
[19:49:37] <sim[m]> mjlbach[m]: Yep it's just have notify the server that something changed
[19:49:42] <mjlbach[m]> But yes, make the tracking issue

[23:06:05] <sim[m]> mjlbach: so looks like i had some confusion, the did/will stuff only needs to be triggered when the client does stuff, so support should mostly be in nvim-tree or whatever, but would need them in workspace edits which add/delete/rename a file
[23:06:15] <clason[m]> looks OK on GH?
[23:06:23] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah I was confused, there are two things we could support

[23:06:33] <mjlbach[m]> * are two (sets of) things we
[23:06:36] <mjlbach[m]> sorry busy morning
[23:09:08] <sim[m]> oke i updated the issue, should make sense now
[23:09:21] <Bowuigi[m]> YorickPeterse[m]: That is a normal markdown thing, I think it was so you can hard wrap at 80 characters without issues
[23:09:42] <Bowuigi[m]> It hits you when you less expect it to happen
[23:10:29] <YorickPeterse[m]> Bowuigi: No, IIRC GH deviates from the standard
[23:10:36] <YorickPeterse[m]> "standard" markdown doesn't care about line wrapping
[23:10:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> But GH made it so a line wrap translates into a `<br>`
[23:11:02] <YorickPeterse[m]> So every time you carefully write something in nvim and save it, it looks like shit

[23:32:41] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> Is there a way in neovim to have it produce a new pty and provide access to the master for lua to manipulate while having neovim still managing the slave? I ask because one of the next large items for distant.nvim is providing a shell and what I'd like to do is have the plugin manage the master like ssh does.

[23:35:19] <mjlbach[m]> You could use something like nvim remote or run with -c
[23:35:19] <sim[m]> got it working with a few changes to nvim-tree 
[23:35:43] <mjlbach[m]> sim: so cool
[23:35:58] <mjlbach[m]> is there anything we should put in core to facilitate this?
[23:36:15] <sim[m]> only if apply_workspace_edits rename something
[23:36:33] * sim[m] uploaded an image: (21KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sSViPVXCfVRluVvZTcApQqRZ/image.png >
[23:36:39] <sim[m]> maybe these but its not a big thing
[23:37:42] <mjlbach[m]> hmm do we support renames with apply_workspace_edits?
[23:37:53] <sim[m]> core has to support this https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles but idk if any language server uses these
[23:38:06] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah that was what I thought you were originally asking for
[23:38:39] <sim[m]> ig i was asking for the auto import change
[23:38:42] <sim[m]> idk what this does practically lol

[23:51:58] <Mathias[m]> sim[m]: Yep, I  think it was even in 0.5 already
[23:52:37] <mjlbach[m]> Do we need to send the notification when the server requests those operations though?
[23:52:48] <sim[m]> it says so in the spec
[23:52:50] <mjlbach[m]> I thought it was if the client performed clientside edits
[23:53:19] <mjlbach[m]> > The did rename files notification is sent from the client to the server when files were renamed from within the client.
[23:53:34] <mjlbach[m]> Hm
[23:53:42] <mjlbach[m]> I can check vscode later
[23:53:43] <sim[m]> The will rename files request is sent from the client to the server before files are actually renamed as long as the rename is triggered from within the client either by a user action or by applying a workspace edit
[23:54:06] <Mathias[m]> I think the open/ close events happen anyways based on the buffer creation/deletion 
[23:54:16] <mjlbach[m]> Yes
[23:54:37] <mjlbach[m]> Vim doesn't really have rename
[23:54:41] <mjlbach[m]> it has save and delete
[23:55:03] <mjlbach[m]> so it should trigger didOpen on the new file anyways

[23:57:55] <sim[m]> mhm but language servers still use the rename thingy with oldUri and newUri to change imports for example

[23:59:42] <mjlbach[m]> hm ok
[23:59:52] <mjlbach[m]> maybe split the issue into two, and we'll track didChangeWatchedFiles separately
