[00:38:09] <qhong> visual-mode seems to label every element in the page. Could it label only the visual part? This can usually save 1 keystroke
[00:48:07] <qhong> why is ANNOTATE-VISIBLE-ONLY-P deprecated?
[00:51:55] <waleee> qhong: probably because of this commit message https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/4aefffa119acb7e39ca1a27b05dad04940e60b3f
[00:52:14] <waleee> and then https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/b69de3524e00d4a57f0f2680b3cc080206182dbb
[00:52:37] <waleee> (retained for backwards compability)
[00:52:52] <qhong> ah, it is doing sth not quite what I was thinking about
[00:53:18] <qhong> I want the labels strings to be generated for only visible part
[00:53:27] <qhong> and this is real efficiency improvement for user
[00:53:39] <qhong> because the label strings will become shorter

[06:11:04] <qhong> Can I hack nyxt by manipulating plump DOM nodes directly? I read some source and they're manually building HTML strings, which seems dreadful

[07:11:07] *** Joins: pranavats (3fba1d1b34@jabberfr.org)
[07:25:50] <aartaka> qhong: Yes, you can add/remove/modify Plump nodes and then serialize it into HTML. This is quite impractical, however — it will be hard to read this code and hard to understand what's the result. Having some HTML generated by, e.g., Spinneret is much less verbose and quite predictable, too.
[07:26:13] <aartaka> qhong: Actually, where do you see manual HTML building? I was pretty sure we almost never do it...

[07:38:38] <aartaka> qhong: huh, intefesting :D
[07:39:00] <qhong> aartaka: will there be performance problem if I manipulate plump node and then serialize it?
[07:40:06] <qhong> aartaka: Also I was reading input-edit, does it make a buffer, copy the text string to it, make the edit, and then copy back? If that's the case then it's quite surprising that there weren't any performance problem...
[07:40:24] <aartaka> qhong: Plump is generally quite fast, but not as fast as Spinneret, I suppose. So, if you do that _a lot_ on big trees, it can be noticeably laggy. I did no exact measurements, though.
