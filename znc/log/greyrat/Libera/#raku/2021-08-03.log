[00:25:38] <[Coke]> Seems a reasonable ask
[00:27:21] <moon-child> there are quite a lot of unicode characters, it might take a while
[00:27:37] <MasterDuke> hm. does rakudo know all the valid names?
[00:27:52] <moon-child> I wonder if there's some kind of precomputation you can do on a set of names (like some kind of hashing) that lets you quickly identify close levenshtein matches?
[00:27:59] <MasterDuke> yep
[00:28:08] <MasterDuke> levenshtein automata
[00:28:23] <lizmat> could be a nice project for someone  :-)
[00:29:32] <moon-child> MasterDuke: hmm, that looks like clearly an improvement but not an escape from pathological performance
[00:29:43] <moon-child> you're still linear in the number of unicode character names, which is quite large
[00:30:06] <[Coke]> yah, but it's on error, so it's OK if its a little slow.
[00:30:15] <MasterDuke> yeah. you might be able to do something with a trie
