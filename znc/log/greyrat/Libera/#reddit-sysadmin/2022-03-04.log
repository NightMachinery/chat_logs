[03:30:05] <kerat58> by any chance, anyone in the group know of a config situation that will cause some Javascript files to be responded to with http 401 when using ios but not when using other device types?
[03:30:47] <kerat58> situation is this;  customer has server  that is behind oracle WAF (server is not in oracle cloud, it is actually a regular server that just has all WAF IPs whitelisted and all other IPs blocked)
[03:30:59] <kerat58> web page has various JS files in it, when you use ios, the files respond http 401
[03:31:14] <kerat58> if you set up a 2nd server with the exact same site on it, but use CloudFlare instead of Oracle, that same device will be able to load the files now
[03:31:38] <kerat58> Customer refuses to admit that the Oracle WAF has to be the difference between the working and non working setup

[04:02:19] <Kiernian> the hardest part for me is picking the layout I want to use
[04:02:47] <Kiernian> once I have the "what stuff goes where" figured out, it's just trying to cram in only the important stuff
[04:02:56] <sd_> 07<S​trongBad> last time I did this I just used one of the MS word templates
[04:04:00] <Kiernian> I mean, you've already got a leg up because you're being told to apply for a position someone thinks you'd be a good fit for, so you can dodge all the crappy "seeding the background with keywords in white-on-white small fonts" stuff
[04:04:04] <sd_> 05<v​yz> i basically found a random template online and just copied lol

[04:19:19] <Kiernian> oh, yeah, definitely no longer than two pages (I go single page, front and back)
[04:19:25] <Kiernian> (if I'm printing out copies, that is)
[04:19:53] <sd_> 07<S​trongBad> good advice
[04:20:32] <parted> SrongBad: any template is fine. When I do hiring, there ends up being 3 different templates people choose from, and its the content that I end up reading. Dont worry regarding picture or not, because it isnt relevant (imho)
[04:20:38] <Kiernian> and if they're using any "software" that makes you input your resume as anything other than a straight file upload (no scanning/character recognition, or filling out fields) then bring multiple printed copies to the interview.

[07:47:57] <jay-ros> legit not there today, I bought LRDIMM ram to go with my RDIMM ram already in my home server
[07:48:20] <jay-ros> because I'm a fuckin idiot and I didn't check that one time because the title said 'registered'
[07:48:43] <jay-ros> I've got 32 gig of memory sitting there... staring at me.... judging me
[07:57:20] <yuken> mmm
[07:57:24] <yuken> another bag of flamin' hot doritos
[07:57:50] <jay-ros> you'll be shitting flourescent orange for a month
[07:58:02] <yuken> nah jay-ros, super dark red.
[07:58:06] <yuken> crimson.
[07:58:27] <jay-ros> sounds like a wild ride
[07:58:27] <sd_> 02<j​imender2> jayros isnt that mean over buying ram like that?  So many animals dying for that.
[07:58:42] <Kiernian> When they were fairly new, I once ate an entire large bag of flamin hot cheetos...back when they were puffs. yuken is right, it's red.
[07:59:12] <jay-ros> @Jimender2 I feel like technology might not be the best career option for you
[07:59:16] <yuken> Kiernian, yeah. This is the same Flamin' Hot seasonings
[07:59:19] <yuken> but on doritos.
[07:59:52] <sd_> 02<j​imender2> Ive not sysadmined since covid started.
[08:00:04] <Kiernian> yeah, that red food coloring is fierce. Like, I forgot that I'd eaten the entire bag in one sitting and a few hours later...I told my boss "if I disappear, come find me, I'm probably bleeding internally"
[08:00:14] <sd_> 02<j​imender2> I went to the dark side and became a dev
[08:01:08] <yuken> They're so good, too, Kiernian.
[08:01:10] <yuken> Good god.
[08:01:37] <Kiernian> yeah, that sounds delightful. I still wish they'd bring back the cheetos puffs once, though. crunchy cheetos suck.
[08:01:59] <Kiernian> although more than anything from that time period, I miss jalapeno cheddar doritos 3D's the most
[08:02:04] <sd_> 02<j​imender2> I think they still have the cheetos puffs
[08:02:36] <sd_> 02<j​imender2> What do you think about DanDees cheese puffs?
[08:02:36] <yuken> Kiernian, they're bringing those back.
[08:02:50] <xe0n> stop doxing yourself mitchy...fuck sake
[08:03:01] <xe0n> and no one cares about busted laptop screens, you're doing helpdesk, we get it.
[08:03:02] <yuken> Kiernian, also, the puffs still exist.
[08:03:11] <yuken> https://www.amazon.com/Flamin-Cheese-Flavored-Snacks-Cheetos/dp/B00U9WQ9RC/
[08:03:17] <yuken> also god, alcohol tastes bad.
[08:03:18] <jay-ros> omfg xe0n
[08:03:24] <jay-ros> ten points to hufflepuff
[08:03:59] <Kiernian> sweet, thanks yuken
[08:04:13] <yuken> Kiernian, they'd be cheaper in-store
[08:04:22] <yuken> It's more likely that your chip vendor at local stores just doesn't stock em, Kiernian.
[08:04:27] <sd_> 02<M​itchy93> Yeah, EDP cable was damaged, LCD itself is fine
[08:04:35] <yuken> Ask manager at a local store "hey, can you tell your Lays guy to order Cheetos Puffs Flaming Hot?"
[08:04:39] <yuken> "I'll buy [this many] of them.}
[08:04:45] <yuken> buy like, a box of them (dozen)
[08:05:04] <yuken> it'll cost you like $30 for a fresh box Kiernian, with expiry dates in 1+ year
[08:05:24] <Kiernian> yeah, most likely. the chip selection up here has gone to crap in recent years. boatloads of chile limón crap and none of the stuff I like.
[08:05:31] <Kiernian> and yeah, that's an idea
[08:05:35] <yuken> Just ask a manager, or the chip guy directly.
[08:05:41] <yuken> The chip guy decides what comes in.
[08:06:04] <yuken> When I worked receiving solo at local Walgreens-esque store, I got my Utz/Zapps guy to bring in Voodoo Heat, which are rare to find here Kiernian.
[08:06:09] <yuken> Got them for half the price of buying online.
[08:06:16] <Kiernian> voodoo heat are amazing
[08:06:39] <yuken> basically - tell manager in a polite way, "can you ask your guy to get me this"
[08:06:39] <yuken> or
[08:06:40] <Kiernian> every once in a while someone will stock a few of those
[08:06:44] <yuken> stalk the store until the lays guy walks in.
[08:06:49] <yuken> Mine came on Mondays and Fridays.

[08:33:51] <yuken> SirSceptalot, find some tank crew, pay them $2000 US each to desert to Ukraine
[08:33:58] <yuken> get me a $1,000,000 tank
[08:34:54] <SirSceptalot> The Ukranian people are allowed to keep any spoils of war they obtain themselves, but I'm somewhat sceptical if uncle sam would let you bring it back in your carry-on

[08:35:37] <jay-ros> because it probably has a battery
[08:35:55] <yuken> Hell, they'd probably buy it from me at a high price SirSceptalot, to inspect it themselves.
[08:36:01] <yuken> But even if they didn't, it's legal to import.
[08:36:15] <SirSceptalot> because technically a functional tank is a container with more than 500ml of liquid in it, and you can't take that on a plane

[10:43:30] <DrZak> so i cant see the problem
[10:43:37] <kerat58> lol
[10:44:24] <kerat58> not gonna lie, at university i had a system
[10:44:50] <kerat58> i'd go to the first several classes in a term and grab the professor's style to figure out how much "basd on the book" they were
[10:44:55] <PrincessZoey> https://thelounge.zoeyrae.dev/uploads/4bd6fe7cb21a350b/MidTerm.pdf this is the exam from a few years ago. if the word is on that paper he expects it to be in your answer. if you omit a part, you lose points. if you put it into your own words, you lose even more. 
[10:45:10] <kerat58> if i had a decent confidnece level that the class was very close to the avialable books i'd stop going to class ecept for exams lol
[10:45:24] <DrZak> what bullshit are you studying
[10:45:35] <PrincessZoey> that's a required CS class - Ethics and Technology
[10:46:05] <DrZak> soo
[10:46:18] <DrZak> like the yearly corporate ethics guidlines review
[10:46:22] <DrZak> which is always fun
[10:46:28] <PrincessZoey> he teaches programming classes too. apparently you get handed a piece of paper and have to write out the code to answer the questions. no editors or assistance. 
[10:46:43] <kerat58> i love the fonts on this study guide
[10:46:45] <kerat58> very whimsical
[10:47:02] <DrZak> they stopped giving classes to us, when we went 'Oh, this one was broken by manager X, Y years ago on deal Z' every two minutes
[10:47:28] <PrincessZoey> https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1963559
[10:47:40] <DrZak> i love corporate hypocrytism
[10:49:21] <DrZak> oh dear, the whining seems to indicate pupils wants to have fun school
[10:49:41] <DrZak> so, how does a class about theory normally work anyway
[10:50:09] <DrZak> i really know only the teacher showing up slides, reading them, we would write them and that was kinda it
[10:50:27] <DrZak> is there another way how to teach tons of text?
[10:51:12] <PrincessZoey> DrZak that's his exact teaching style... except each chapters slides are...
[10:51:47] <PrincessZoey> like 70+ slides and it's an one hour a week class
[10:52:00] <PrincessZoey> I spent more time getting to and from campus than I do in that class.
[10:53:16] <kerat58> lol look at this gem
[10:53:17] <kerat58> The class is extremely boring. The beginning is bearable, but towards the end all it is is going over SQL queries for weeks straight. It's impossible to stay paying attention for more than half an hour max. There's only three assignments so make sure you do them right, and you'll probably pass.
[10:53:31] <kerat58> LOL "going over SQL queries for weeks straight"

[13:45:54] <PrincessZoey> there, the last of the passwords on google are changed.
[13:46:33] <kerat58> I'm sorry to announec that the Google Password site was part of a man in the middle (MITM) attack in the past day or so
[13:46:43] <kerat58> So if you put your passwrods into there, chances are they all got phished and you need to change them all again
[13:46:51] <PrincessZoey> ...please tell me your kidding
[13:46:58] <Joe-Developer> well
[13:47:07] <kerat58> Yes, I am kidding :D
[13:47:11] <Joe-Developer> That's why 1Password is king B)
[13:47:14] <PrincessZoey> fuck you xD
[13:47:17] <kerat58> hahaha
[13:47:18] <DrZak> :DDDD
[13:47:19] <monr0e> KeePass
[13:47:20] <PrincessZoey> I just had to change 375 passwords
[13:47:23] <monr0e> entirely offline
[13:47:28] <kerat58> 375 passwords lol
[13:47:48] <teh_f4ll3n> lol, boss got rid of my drive dock and my cable stash
[13:47:48] <PrincessZoey> look, I was lazy and not very creative.
[13:47:53] <kerat58> real sysadmins make all passwords '4206969' and just rely on  2FA
[13:48:14] <PrincessZoey> now every single account has a unique password, so when one inevitably gets compromised, I don't need to go change 250 of them also
[13:48:21] <teh_f4ll3n> DasPassword123
[13:48:30] <teh_f4ll3n> is the ream admin password
[13:48:37] <kerat58> for exchange i recommend 'email'
[13:48:38] <PrincessZoey> yeah, if a site offers 2fa I use it, is the only reason It took me years to finally change the compromised ones
[13:48:42] <Joe-Developer> Hunter2
[13:48:55] <PrincessZoey> all I see is *******
[13:49:08] <Joe-Developer> huh
[13:49:11] <Joe-Developer> strange
[13:49:34] <PrincessZoey> my head hurts. I breathed too hard and my monitor fell over and hit me on the head, lmao
[13:49:38] <PrincessZoey> and that's a chonker LCD
[13:49:44] <PrincessZoey> chonker for an LCD*
[13:49:53] <kerat58> for those who remember...back in the day, windows 95, password inputs, the placeholder looked more like a tiny 'x' than an asterisk
[13:49:57] <teh_f4ll3n> you still in bed?

[13:50:03] <kerat58> i still miss that font to this day
[13:50:13] <monr0e> If your monitor isn't screwed into your desk, you aren't sysadmining hard enough
[13:50:22] <kerat58> yeah for real
[13:50:29] <Joe-Developer> ˣˣˣˣˣˣˣ
[13:50:33] <kerat58> needs to be bolted down for the safety of yourself and others around you
[13:50:50] <monr0e> I know I'm kidding but mine actually is
[13:51:07] <monr0e> on account of not having the right stand for it and it being propped forward on a block of wood
[13:51:18] <kerat58> i have bad back issues, and need mine elevated quite high for comfortable viewing, so my monitor stand is a 'post' which screws into the desk
[13:51:37] <kerat58> and it did not cost 999 either
[13:51:56] <kerat58> it was like 40 USD or something, plus of course a quick wink at the clerk at the computer shop ;)
[13:52:11] <kerat58> that probably ended up making it cost more though
[13:52:14] <kerat58> i don't really know
[13:52:17] <kerat58> never can tell
[13:52:28] <monr0e> pff, all you need is some old scaffy bar, an angle grinder, and a universal clamp or two
[13:52:42] <kerat58> yeah angle grinder...pshhhhhhhhhhhhh
[13:52:54] <kerat58> that sounds like a saturday project and saturday is beer drinking day
[13:53:51] <monr0e> twenty minutes on an afternoon man, doesn't have to be pretty. Bit of black paint will sort it out if you care enough
[13:53:58] <kerat58> oh btw new project idea for everyone who goes to or has access to a university
[13:54:05] <kerat58> let's set up a policy so that the wifi limits each client to dialup-era speeds

[13:55:19] <Cl0udNinja> well... waiting for it to download... if it takes too long though. I might not lol
[13:55:32] <Cl0udNinja> well it is friday.... >.>... morning..
[13:55:34] <kerat58> cannot start games on Saturday night, because Saturday night is a school night -- because we all have Sunday School in the morning, kids
[13:56:44] <PrincessZoey> spring break  starts for me at 10:05am cst
[13:57:14] <kerat58> spring break
[13:57:24] <kerat58> ahhhhh to be that young again when there are scheduled random 'breaks' throughout the year
[13:57:25] <kerat58> man
[13:57:27] <kerat58> hah
[13:57:28] <monr0e> I just fixed my chair that woudn't stay poofed up with a ratchet clamp. I think I might be a redneck
[13:57:30] <Cl0udNinja> lol right
[13:57:51] <kerat58> and then holidays
[13:57:54] <Cl0udNinja> I am planning a camping trip in march I think
[13:57:59] <Cl0udNinja> maybe end of april
[13:57:59] <kerat58> in the States for example, Christopher Columbus day 
[13:58:07] <Cl0udNinja> INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
[13:58:09] <kerat58> you all will protest it on social media but I know your ass ain't showin' up for school as part of that protest
[13:58:10] <kerat58> so
[13:58:12] <Cl0udNinja> stupid pc
[13:58:14] <Cl0udNinja> anyway
[13:58:59] <kerat58> anyway I think that PrincessZoey will be doing the sensible thing and "getting ahead" on studying for some of those more difficult courses during Spring Break
[13:59:08] <Cl0udNinja> monr0e, you mean a ratchet strap?
[13:59:13] <Cl0udNinja> or a ratcheting clamp?
[13:59:15] <PrincessZoey> lmfao I'm fucking like bunnies /s
[13:59:31] <monr0e> No, one of those clamps that clicks into position and is adjustable
[13:59:37] <kerat58> sprin break
[13:59:41] <kerat58> never got to do that one the 'fun' way
[13:59:52] <kerat58> was not all up and up on the whole social scene at the time in my life when Spring Break was an actualt hing

[14:13:10] <Cl0udNinja> WELL WHY ARENT YOU GOIN TO MTV SPRING BREAK THEN
[14:13:15] <Cl0udNinja> WOOOO SPRING BREAAAK
[14:13:16] <kerat58> THANK YOU 
[14:13:17] <PrincessZoey> no, I'd sleep through my exam xD
[14:13:17] <kerat58> Goodness
[14:13:31] <PrincessZoey> I missed my first math test with that trick! "I'll just take a 2 hour nap!"
[14:13:36] * PrincessZoey wakes up 9 hours later
[14:13:37] <kerat58> I say that you go to an airline or travel service of your choice and book a ticket to miami asap
[14:13:37] <PrincessZoey> "welp"
[14:14:07] <PrincessZoey> I'd rather a rabid bear rip my tits off
[14:14:14] <kerat58> "hello everyone, I am here for 1 week and would like you to help me make my spring break a success.  Can I count on your assistance?"

[14:14:33] <kerat58> lol
[14:14:41] <kerat58> spring break won't be so easy if you do that though
[14:14:51] <Cl0udNinja> idk
[14:14:57] <Cl0udNinja> it would make a good ice breaker story
[14:15:02] <PrincessZoey> I'm recovering from this stressful ass week
[14:15:02] <kerat58> yes that is true
[14:15:09] <kerat58> ah, the good ole' SAW
[14:15:12] <kerat58> stressful ass week
[14:15:19] <kerat58> You know back when I was your age, that was the only kind of week there was
[14:15:23] <PrincessZoey> oh, I was wondering what a Squad automatic weapon had to do with that 🤣
[14:15:26] <kerat58> we just called it a 'week'
[14:15:29] <kerat58> and it was 8 days back then too
[14:15:53] <PrincessZoey> did you have to walk uphill both ways in the snow too grandpa?
[14:16:04] <DrZak> I like this job marginally more then being homeless
[14:16:45] <kerat58> PrincessZoey:  sort of, except it wasn't a hill.  It was called the Bering Strait
[14:17:33] <kerat58> It used to be a pretty safe bet route to take 
[14:17:40] <kerat58> but then the Democrats started to ruin it, and the communists finished it off
[14:19:09] <kerat58> back in those days, with $5 you could get movie tickets, have dinner at a drive in movie, and have money left over for gas
[14:19:51] <kerat58> Nowadays, $5 is what you pay your Uber to go from "one side of campus" to another
[14:20:47] <kerat58> lol
[14:20:56] <kerat58> you know what would be funny, in all seriousness
[14:21:09] <kerat58> go up to some old people in public
[14:21:26] <kerat58> and be like (all loud) "I bet you this guy used to SHRED ass back in the 60sZ"
[14:21:49] <kerat58> C'mon, Ernie, I know you have some keepsake pics of your high school girlfriends folded up in that wallet

[14:26:28] <DrZak> A victim of gang rape, left for dead in the park boathouse, the once vivacious Teena can now only regret that she has survived.

[14:26:40] <layer8> kerat58 meant: "joyce needs to learn to pick better shrinks"
[14:27:42] <kerat58> lol taht too
[14:27:55] <kerat58> And OMG not the park boathouse again
[14:27:59] <kerat58> Remind me to stay away from there
[14:28:22] <DrZak> or come around more often, depending on your preferrences
[14:30:20] <kerat58> man
[14:30:26] <kerat58> you know who is a winner?
[14:30:28] <kerat58> Linus Torvalds

[14:58:03] <PrincessZoey> Welp, at least civ5 started crashing AFTER I turned my paper about it in
[14:58:43] <riff-IRC> had a computer come in for service yesterday- complaint was lockups and black-screening while gaming

[14:58:47] <DrZak> :DDD
[14:58:49] <DrZak> i LOOOVE trolling
[14:59:14] <PrincessZoey> riff-IRC it played fine the other day lmfao. now I'm loading the game I was playing and it crashed to desktop
[14:59:18] <riff-IRC> long story short, Windows somehow managed to frag grenade the GPU drivers into oblivion
[14:59:25] <riff-IRC> lol
[15:00:15] <riff-IRC> either that or the system builder installed bad drivers and just resorted to disabling the GPU in Device Manager
[15:00:22] <PrincessZoey> I bought all the DLC for civ 6, the second it installed the game never loaded again
[15:00:42] <PrincessZoey> and I dunno if it's a mac thing or what
[15:00:47] <DrZak> so, anybody bought that hyped elder ring game?
[15:01:17] <DrZak> i just saw it doesnt support 21:9 and the any reasonable frequences out of it
[15:03:18] <PrincessZoey> a bunch of my friends bought it.
[15:03:30] <PrincessZoey> I can't stand darksoul types games. Me not that kind of masochist 
[15:03:38] <DrZak> hmm 
[15:03:39] <DrZak> yea
[15:03:49] <DrZak> the videos looked a bit skyrim like
[15:03:52] <DrZak> so fine- ish
[15:03:56] <DrZak> but seems buggy
[15:04:07] <PrincessZoey> can't be any worse than new world's launch
[15:04:09] <DrZak> thats a reason why i didnt by cyberpunk
[15:04:25] <DrZak> new world - is tat like 2nd life thing?
[15:04:31] <PrincessZoey> no, it's amazon's MMO
[15:04:46] <PrincessZoey> 940k people played at launch, 2 weeks later it dropped to the mid 30k's and sat
[15:04:55] <DrZak> oh, looking at video, looks like world of warcraft
[15:05:02] <PrincessZoey> I bought cyberpunk like a year after release, played like 10 hours of it and never picked it up again
[15:05:19] <PrincessZoey> there were so many economy breaking bugs at launch that people got fed up with wipes
[15:05:51] <PrincessZoey> LMFAO they just had another dupe bug in new world
[15:08:24] <kerat58> 'dupe bug'?
[15:08:30] <PrincessZoey> items are duplicating 
[15:10:20] <teh_f4ll3n> DrZak, I guess it just died eventually EOL so to speak
[15:10:36] <teh_f4ll3n> I can't even run diagnostics on it

[15:27:35] <riff-IRC> yep
[15:27:44] <Hunterkll> Amazon has the player base of a 20 year old MMO that only diehard fans and occasional returners and new players play, that has no major expansions coming ever, but minor story/content stuff continually trickled in
[15:27:47] <Hunterkll> that's hilarious

[15:39:49] <Hunterkll> <_<
[15:39:51] <Hempux> Hunterkll would script that and be done in 2 minutes, i would script it and it would take me longer to do that than just manually hopping in and renaming them :p

[17:35:00] <Hunterkll> meh, i always do, but never have issues getting them unlocked
[17:35:14] <Hunterkll> mind you, it also depends on the bands the providers support, if the phone supports say, things like VoLTE, etc....

[21:33:05] <DomLS3> Hunterkll
[21:33:37] <DomLS3> for password writeback in 365, you need azure p1. This enabled it across the tenant. Do all users need the p1 license to be compliant to use it or does it just need ONE azure P1 license
[21:34:12] <Hunterkll> to be compliant, each user using SSPR needs a license
[21:34:17] <Hunterkll> it's a P1 feature
[21:34:25] <Hunterkll> having just one P1 license does enable it for hte entire tenant though
[21:34:32] <DomLS3> That's what I thought
[21:34:33] <DrZak> :)
[21:34:37] <DomLS3> Do you use Okta?
[21:34:44] <Hunterkll> we ditched okta a while ago
[21:34:50] <Hunterkll> for Azure SSO :)
[21:35:13] <DomLS3> I'm trying to come up with a solution for SSO + password resets/expirations
[21:35:16] <DomLS3> we are hybrid
[21:35:21] <DrZak> unless you have some other solution that for a crazy reason doesnt support azure mfa, it makes little sense to invest into a different product
[21:35:31] <DomLS3> so users can't reset their password without being connected to AD or having the helpdesk reset it for them
[21:35:44] <DrZak> oh, you want to actually screw things up
[21:36:02] <DrZak> then simply disable password writeback
[21:36:09] <Hunterkll> ^
[21:36:14] <Hunterkll> simple checkbox in AD connect settings
[21:36:29] <DomLS3> we *want* password writeback in some form or fashion though
[21:36:32] <Hunterkll> oh
[21:36:33] <Hunterkll> okay
[21:36:39] <DomLS3> the issue is password resets
[21:36:39] <DrZak> what
[21:36:40] <DrZak> :DDD
[21:36:40] <Hunterkll> so that would be connected to AD then
[21:36:48] <Hunterkll> so.... set up security questions/reset funcitons
[21:36:52] <Hunterkll> it is called self-service password reset
[21:36:54] <Hunterkll> for a reason
[21:36:56] <DomLS3> right now we have a web portal that we wrote that resets their AD and 365 password at the same time for them
[21:37:05] <DomLS3> we have to decom is because it's 2008
[21:37:05] <Hunterkll> why isn't hte 365 password AD synced
[21:37:07] <Hunterkll> o.O
[21:37:12] <DomLS3> it is ad synced
[21:37:12] <DrZak> why would you want password writeback if you dont want people to reset their passwords?
[21:37:24] <DomLS3> DrZak: we *do* want people to reset their passwords
[21:37:26] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: if they use SSPR, you don't need any of that
[21:37:31] <Hunterkll> it updates on the 365 and AD side immediately
[21:37:36] <Hunterkll> and fails if it can't update the AD side and makes no changes
[21:37:40] <A_Dragon> you know
[21:37:40] <DomLS3> but 90% of our accounts aren't local they are in the field with no VPN acces back to AD
[21:37:43] <A_Dragon> its discussions like these
[21:37:49] <A_Dragon> that make me regret having AD ping me
[21:37:57] <DrZak> i am now confused
[21:38:06] <DomLS3> Ok
[21:38:08] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: then they'll have to use the old password on the laptop and you'll have to figure something out
[21:38:10] <Hunterkll> like pre-logon VPN
[21:38:10] <DrZak> you wrote you dont want people to reset their password

[21:38:25] <mistiry> A_Dragon: oof thats gotta result in lots of false pings
[21:38:28] <DomLS3> DrZak: when did I say that
[21:38:30] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: so what's the problem then?
[21:38:34] <DomLS3> for fucks sake
[21:38:40] <mistiry> especially in a channel like this one
[21:38:45] <Hunterkll> "without being connected to AD or having the helpdesk reset it for them"
[21:38:55] <DrZak> so users can't reset their password without being connected to AD
[21:39:01] <DomLS3> The problem is people in the field who are not AD connected (machine wise) need to be able to reset their own 365 passwords
[21:39:05] <Hunterkll> okay
[21:39:08] <Hunterkll> so that's what SSPR does
[21:39:10] <Hunterkll> solved

[21:41:07] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: I mean, if you make it so they're cloud only accounts without AD accounts, then they don't need the P1 license for SSPR

[21:43:39] <Hobadee_> Anyone know if it's possible to download GCP logs for offline analysis/retention?
[21:44:14] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: AFAIK its free
[21:44:25] <Hunterkll> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/sso/#overview
[21:44:41] <Hunterkll> of course that relies on your apps supporting SAML/OAUTH or whatever
[21:45:25] <DomLS3> So basically, P1 is what we're gonna really need to do in order to have self service password resets
[21:46:15] <Hunterkll> yea, that's what we do, O365 E3 + a suite that has P1 in it + Azure SSO for stuff (that we used to use okta for)
[21:46:42] <DomLS3> So why did you kick Okta specifically? Cost and because Azure did it for you already for free?
[21:46:55] <Hunterkll> pretty much, we weren't doing anything with Okta that azure couldn't do
[21:47:12] <DomLS3> The thing that Okta has me interested in is it's services it supports for single sign on
[21:47:12] <Hunterkll> Okta was a big multi-domain stopgap we threw in because it could what we needed at the *time*
[21:47:20] <Hunterkll> once we settled down it was whatever
[21:47:23] <DomLS3> we use a lot of third party stuff that I don't think is capable of using only azure
[21:47:33] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: they are both using the same standards for the most part
[21:47:38] <Hunterkll> anything that supports SAML works on both
[21:47:45] <Hunterkll> shit you could use g suite to log into those apps 
[21:47:57] <DomLS3> we essentially want people to be able to login to as many services as possible with the same username and password they use for AD/365 Email
[21:48:01] <Hunterkll> it's standards based
[21:48:14] <DomLS3> and adhere to the password complexity/expiration policies
[21:48:16] <Hunterkll> you log into myapplications.azure.com or whatever, and click whatever app you want, it SAML auths you to it
[21:49:26] <DomLS3> hmm
[21:49:46] <Hunterkll> most of the apps we have in that list are in house ones or 3rd party shit (like workday, a business process management system, concur travel expense stuff, PMO stuff, Oracle stuff, email filtering portal for releasing suspected spam, zoom, etc)
[21:49:52] <DomLS3> What else does P1 have that makes it more appealing to C-levels to front the costs for besides just SSPR
[21:50:22] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: an SLA for Azure MFA :P 
[21:50:53] <Hunterkll> you can assign users to applications that you SAML/OAUTH/App gallery via groups instead of individually
[21:51:03] <Hunterkll> Application app proxy for on-premise applications 
[21:51:25] <Hunterkll> conditional access and *session lifetime management*

[21:54:00] <Hunterkll> the group one is nice, move away from managing on-prem and external vendor apps directly, and just add users to groups then the app shows up, they log in, it just works
[21:56:40] <Hunterkll> of course, the main immediate benefit for you is SSPR, which means that after a change or authenticated reset, the password is identical everywhere instead of the system you have now which does two changes in the back to keep up with the sync

[23:40:54] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> I hate wireless keyboards too
[23:41:09] <fritzwastaken> I find them fucking useless
[23:41:35] <fritzwastaken> im never far enough from my pc to need a wireless mouse and keyboard
[23:42:11] <vinrock> i dont like the feeling of a wire tugging on the mouse
[23:42:12] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> Going back to wired mice solved so many issues I had
[23:42:15] <vinrock> keyboards arent a big deal
[23:42:26] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> Mouse Bungee
[23:42:28] <fritzwastaken> my keyboard has a thingy
[23:42:33] <fritzwastaken> mouse pad*
[23:42:36] <fritzwastaken> yea
[23:42:38] <fritzwastaken> a bungee
[23:42:43] <vinrock> i got a wireless keyboard and it runs out of battery too quickly
[23:42:58] <fritzwastaken> spamming f in the chat too much
[23:43:15] <vinrock> i like having the backlighting turned on so i can get my dollar's worth
[23:43:23] <nx032> yeah dont ask me why theyre on w10 home
[23:43:23] <vinrock> but it nukes the battery every like 4 days
[23:43:51] <fritzwastaken> this is why YOU WILL NEVER HAVE METAL LEGS
[23:44:01] <DrGibby> HI FRITZ!
[23:44:04] <DrGibby> sorry for the delay
[23:44:08] <fritzwastaken> o hai!
[23:44:10] <fritzwastaken> o/
[23:44:14] <DrGibby> o/
[23:44:17] <fritzwastaken> I miss you bb
[23:44:21] <DrGibby> <3
[23:44:24] <JollyRgrs>  unless you have a unique desk situation, i've yet to see a great argument for a wireless keyboard at a desk
[23:44:32] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> Got my nice mechanical keyboard and wired mouse at home. Nothing Fancy. Just a Logitech G203
[23:45:01] <JollyRgrs> my Logi MX Master 2s is great wireless or wired... and paired with a nice wired keyboard :D
[23:45:09] <fritzwastaken> To be faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaair
[23:45:11] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> That little 203 has lasted longer than any high end mice I have had so far
[23:45:16] <fritzwastaken> wireless shit was made for mobile users
[23:45:21] <fritzwastaken> Sales folk
[23:45:25] <fritzwastaken> C levels
[23:45:27] <fritzwastaken> People we hate
[23:45:36] <fritzwastaken> not desk jockies
[23:45:36] <vinrock> jolly
[23:45:36] <nx032> i like wireless keyboards and mice but sec standpoint not the safest
[23:45:42] <vinrock> i have found the one benefit to a wireless keyboard
[23:45:42] <JollyRgrs> all my logi mice have lasted a long long time
[23:45:47] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: which is?
[23:45:56] <vinrock> if youre eating anything sloppy for lunch you can just toss it off to the side real quick while you eat
[23:45:56] <fritzwastaken> how far do you move your keyboard from your workstation nx032 ?
[23:46:06] <vinrock> so you dont get splatter onyour keys
[23:46:19] <nx032> its about cable management and not distance to device
[23:46:29] <fritzwastaken> git gud at cable management?
[23:46:32] <nx032> ive owned a few keyboards as well that the cord wasnt log enough
[23:46:37] <fritzwastaken> a pc takes like... 6 cables
[23:46:38] <nx032> long*
[23:46:48] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> nx032- if an attacker is targeting your keyboards to exploit you, they would have already found an easier and more fruitful path
[23:47:02] <nx032> bluetooth signal can be intercepted 
[23:47:12] <fritzwastaken> Somones got an ego
[23:47:16] <vinrock> tons of older wireless kb/m dont use encryption
[23:47:20] <vinrock> you can intercept the keystrokes
[23:47:26] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> I am saying at that point its an ATP
[23:47:30] <CptLuxx> wanna intercept my strokes?
[23:47:36] <vinrock> all day long bigboy
[23:47:39] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> APT*
[23:47:41] <nx032> you can place autonomous collection points and just log all bluetooth signals intercepting keystrokes 
[23:47:43] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> nx032 If your close enough to the hackers that your worth hacking into... they dont need to use the bluetooth
[23:47:58] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> thats what I'm saying
[23:48:13] <fritzwastaken> its March 4th and I just took my xmas tree to the dumpster
[23:48:15] <nx032> we're a 200 x 60 building, it wouldnt take much to hide a collection point in the bushes next to the outdoor wall
[23:48:18] * fritzwastaken facepalms
[23:48:19] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> "I'm being hacked".... within 15 feet!!! KEVIN YOU FUCK... stop fucking with my mouse
[23:48:33] <vinrock> was it even still a tree of just a christmas stick
[23:48:45] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> We didn't take down our christmas tree until the beginning of feb
[23:48:49] <fritzwastaken> oh no i watered it, it had lights on it
[23:48:55] <fritzwastaken> Xmas trees make me really happy
[23:49:03] <fritzwastaken> Like, its silly
[23:49:06] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> I like them too
[23:49:11] <vinrock> i always watned a house with a treegrowing through it
[23:49:17] <vinrock> i went to a restaurant like that and it was so dope
[23:49:18] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> I joked to my girlfriend that we should keep it up year round but she didn't take to the idea
[23:49:23] <fritzwastaken> Its just turning spring outside and it didnt fit anymore
[23:49:25] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> "Bluetooth can be hacked"... but do they know who you are and are you worth risking being arrested to be hacked?
[23:49:33] <nx032> either way i hate wires and my desk is full of them because i always need to move them, the less wires the better long term. I dont use a wireless keyboard since i use a laptop but i do use a wireless mouse
[23:49:58] <fritzwastaken> vinrock: lol did you go to Papermoon Diner?
[23:50:07] <fritzwastaken> I think they have an indoor tree...
[23:50:20] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: i remove the wrist rest, move the other wrist rest and then just push the keyboard back a bit
[23:50:35] <fritzwastaken> @Cardinal f the man, keep your tree!
[23:50:41] <fritzwastaken> Just dont kill it
[23:50:48] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> Mmm Culvers
[23:50:49] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> we use artificial
[23:50:51] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> trees
[23:50:55] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> tree, rather
[23:51:00] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> not like we have multiple
[23:51:02] <kerat58> one time in middle school a family hired me to "hook up" their new dell PC, but I pissed off the mom by saying that I thought BMWs were for douches
[23:51:28] <vinrock> jolly, specifically if i get pozole, ramen or pho when you're slurping shit is flyin' all over the desk
[23:51:41] <vinrock> so i put my keyboard way off to the side
[23:51:49] <vinrock> fritz maybe i cant remember where it was, i was young af
[23:51:58] <sd_> 04<F​eralTerminator> "Would you like an extended warranty for your mouse?" Nah.. I think for $20 I'm going to absorb the risk on this one
[23:52:00] <vinrock> but i was like yes
[23:52:02] <vinrock> i need this in my life
[23:52:34] <vinrock> the house my mother grew up in was in a family comoiund in the phiippines
[23:52:49] <vinrock> there was a little stream running throuhg the property with koi fish 
[23:53:00] <JollyRgrs> yeah, brothy noodles... you better cover your monitors, too
[23:53:06] <vinrock> it ran into and through the first floor of the main house and there was a bridge indoors to cross it
[23:53:25] <vinrock> jolly yuuup
