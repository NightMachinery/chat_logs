[01:41:56] <dpk> "Pure Emacs! No Extras! No Nonsense!" the website says, but the version you download there for some reason wraps the actual Emacs binary in a Ruby launcher script (using the Mac OS system Ruby, which is due to be nuked in a future version, but at least means you don't need to install it separately). this causes all sorts of weird things, mainly that System Services thinks the name of the app is 'ruby' and not 'Emacs' in some contexts

Is there a simple way to disable all of that automatic mode choosing, and force emacs to always use "Fundamental mode" as its major mode?
[02:03:58] <acdw> ooh i have a related question: how to get emacs to assign a mode to a non-visiting buffer based on its name? e.g., 'scratch.org' should be in org-mode, etc. but `normal-mode' don't do nothin
[02:04:14] <acdw> carbonfiber: you could ... maybe (defalias normal-mode 'ignore)

[02:30:06] <carbonfiber> I played around using mg (microemacs) for a couple of hours yesterday, which is what made me wonder if GNU Emacs had some kind of really dumbed down mode equivalent to mg.

[02:55:15] <carbonfiber> hmm maybe. But I still don't understand why Emacs don't have a simpler command to do it. I doubt I am the only one or the first one to want a dumb emacs that I can gradually enable features for.
[02:55:49] <carbonfiber> what does the snippet you wrote handle that the previous one did not?
[02:56:14] <parsnip> carbonfiber: it'll keep obliterating modes
[02:56:24] <parsnip> i think the first one just prevents them for file extensions
[02:56:30] <parsnip> but there's buffers not associated to files
[02:56:40] <parsnip> like scratch, dired, shell, etc
[02:57:09] <parsnip> and adding that hook will help to make emacs start to just fall apart, which technically you kind of requested

[04:19:50] <parsnip> nice
[04:20:02] <parsnip> thank you
[04:20:34] <ProofTechnique> Is there a nicer way to conditionally render something in a macro? I'm currently doing something like https://paste.sr.ht/~speaker/835e90c8e11ba84b31a1847331c9c4d4a5febdfe, but then I end up rendering nil when some-boolean is nil. This is the first nontrivial macro I've written, so I'm not exactly practiced. I will not be shocked if there's something obvious.
[04:22:31] <dale> You could use ,@ instead and make sure to produce a list that can be spliced in there, instead of a single form.  If the nil doesn't break anything, though, I feel like what you've got is fine.

[04:24:13] <dieggsy> right. nil sitting there on its own shouldn't do anything. if it does it's probably because you expect output from the macro, at which point. something needs to be reworked

[04:31:46] <dieggsy> ProofTechnique: you can sort of return nothing in functions in common lisp and scheme with (values), but it gets turned into something (nil or unspecified, respectively) if something is called on it or it's in a macro or something
[04:31:59] <dieggsy> so no real way to generate nothing AFAIK

[14:56:53] <florhizome[m]> Is there a customization setting to get emacs to reflect my keyboard layout in keybindings? 
[14:56:53] <florhizome[m]> I have a German “QWERTZ” layout on the laptop which changes a lot of the non-alphabet keys, so many bindings become less ergonomic or unfeasible out of the gate.
[14:56:53] <florhizome[m]> Since it’s a deviation that’s fairly common (not only for Germans), I assume there probably is some setting to deal with this, I just don’t really recognize it in the hodgepodge of language and input settings?
