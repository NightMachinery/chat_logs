[02:10:33] <cjac> hi folks.  can someone remind me whether there is a way to get the most recent request issued by $ua ?
[02:11:15] <krismatrix> I am trying to get the helper function from my plugin working. Here is the plugin code: https://l.perl.bot/p/1gt77j and here is the call for the plugin in MyApp.pm: https://l.perl.bot/p/7jn9qb
[02:11:16] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Perlbot Pastebin ] [ Perlbot Pastebin ]
[02:11:40] <krismatrix> I am not really sure how to call/access the helper function.
[02:11:43] *** Joins: stdInOut (~stdInOut@user/stdInOut)
[02:13:16] <mst> cjac: it doesn't remember that, you'd want to do something like write a role that stores it somewhere and then do $c->ua->with_roles('My::UA::Role');
[02:13:56] <mst> krismatrix: $c->helper_name(<args>)
[02:13:57] <cjac> okay.  I'm trying to work around bugs in Google::BigQuery (which, by the way, is not published by us)
[02:14:07] <mst> krismatrix: just like $c->ua e.g. is a helper
[02:14:27] <krismatrix> hmmm...
[02:14:46] <mst> cjac: oh shit, sorry, I'm so used to $ua being Mojo::UserAgent these days :/
[02:14:50] <cjac> the library currently dies with an error on auth failure, but customer cannot tell that it is a 401 HTTP response because the class doesn't keep track of the HTTP response code
[02:15:03] <cjac> mst: no worries.  makes sense that you would :-)
[02:15:21] *** Quits: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog) (Quit: = "")
[02:16:21] <krismatrix> you mean in MyApp.pm, one I have loaded the plugin with $totp_plugin = $self->plugin('MyApp::Plugin::TOTP'); , I can call the helper function by $self->helper_name ?
[02:16:21] <mst> cjac: it looks like it dies()s with the response json?
[02:16:39] <mst> krismatrix: right, helpers show up on both the $app and the $controller objects
[02:16:46] <cjac> right.  and my customer wants to know the http error code
[02:18:38] <krismatrix> That works. A little more help please.
[02:19:01] <krismatrix> I created several helper functions within the Plugin. But some helpers call each other. 
[02:19:20] <krismatrix> Now...maybe some of these functions shouldn't be helpers. Or maybe I need to call them in a different way.
[02:19:25] <krismatrix> what would you advise?
[02:19:28] <krismatrix> For example.
[02:19:51] <krismatrix> $self->generate_current_number(xxx,xxx) called another helper function called decode_base32(). 
[02:20:11] <mst> I'm not sure why that even needs to be a helper rather than a plain subroutine inside the plugin
[02:20:15] <krismatrix> so....I am not sure what is the est way to connect them.
[02:20:29] <krismatrix> That is certainly possible...Is that what you'd recommend?
[02:20:53] <krismatrix> And wouldn't that mean that the function is ONLY accessible by the helper generate_current_number().
[02:21:01] <mst> what
[02:21:14] <mst> that's ... not how perl subroutines work.
[02:21:48] <krismatrix> what are you saying?
[02:22:14] <krismatrix> Are you saying that in the plugin...even if I don't make a helper, I can access the subroutines outside of the plugin?
[02:22:21] <mst> if you declare 'sub decode_base23' in your MyPlugin.pm then you can call it from all the code inside MyPlugin.pm
[02:23:05] <krismatrix> right...'inside' MyPlugin.pm. Not outside of it.
[02:23:13] <mst> you never said you needed it outside.
[02:23:18] <krismatrix> But the helper function is meant to be accessible outside right?
[02:23:25] <mst> and if you need that code in the app -as well- why not just have a utility library that uses Exporter to export that subroutine just like Mojo::Util works
[02:23:40] *** Joins: aspic (~shifty~~~@1.145.92.7)
[02:24:03] <mst> cjac: given _auth generates the $ua object and then immediately uses it, welcome to breaking out Sub::Override and temporarily replacing LWP::UserAgent->new :D
[02:24:17] <vanfanel64> You could call it was MyPlugin:decode_base33 from outside of the plugin module package but at that point I would add it to its own module and maybe use Exporter.
[02:24:30] <vanfanel64> MyPlugin::decode_base32
[02:24:57] <krismatrix> so you are suggesting that instead of having one MyPlugin.pm file with multiple functions, create separate plugins files and put each function there instead?
[02:25:02] <mst> krismatrix: no
[02:25:12] <mst> I'm suggesting that if it's a simple function, it should be a simple function
[02:25:13] <krismatrix> *cries*
[02:25:19] <cjac> mst: I was thinking this would do the trick: https://paste2.org/4DPm9OeD
[02:25:20] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Paste2.org - Viewing Paste 4DPm9OeD ]
[02:25:29] <mst> decode_base32 has no reason whatsoever to even be in a plugin at all
[02:25:47] <krismatrix> why not?
[02:25:57] <mst> because it's just a plain function
[02:26:07] <mst> it can just be in a util package
[02:26:12] <mst> Mojo::Util isn't a plugin either
[02:27:12] <vanfanel64> krismatrix, if you have a lot of general purpose functions, you may want to consider putting them in their own library
[02:27:39] <vanfanel64> Or at least their own module inside the current project
[02:27:44] <mst> right, it's perfectly fine to have a MyApp::Util that basically looks like Mojo::Util but provides your own collection of subroutines
[02:27:59] <vanfanel64> Yes that works well
[02:28:08] <krismatrix> ok.what is this MyApp::Util? Is it another plugin file?
[02:28:19] <mst> ... it's a plain perl module that uses Exporter
[02:28:27] <mst> just like you always do for subroutines you need to use somewhere else
[02:28:28] <vanfanel64> krismatrix, it is just another module (.pm) file
[02:28:40] <mst> trying to jam everything into mojo-specific stuff is an error and is why you're lost
[02:28:42] <krismatrix> ok...but where should this file be placed?
[02:28:53] <mst> in lib/ like every other perl module in your project?
[02:28:58] <vanfanel64> What he said
[02:29:16] <mst> you're inventing problems that don't exist because you're refusing to use standard perl approaches
[02:29:46] <krismatrix> I don't know standard perl approaches...outside of mojo project...my perl usage is often single perl scripts.
[02:30:22] <mst> I've told you to use Exporter more than once now, did you consider, say, reading the documentation for it? :P
[02:30:49] <krismatrix> I know about Exporter is for exporting functions in a module (.pm) file.
[02:30:49] <mst> you coudl even read the source code for Mojo::Util given I already told you that was an example of how to do that
[02:31:06] <krismatrix> that i haven't done yet.
[02:31:07] <mst> right, and decode_base32 is a classic sort of subroutine that you would export from a .pm file
[02:31:07] <vanfanel64> krismatrix, it maybe help to go onto metacpan.org and use the Browse function for some popular modules to get an idea of how people are organizing their file trees for module distributions
[02:31:17] <mst> hence me suggesting you should do that
[02:31:25] <krismatrix> ok

[02:34:33] <krismatrix> so for context (while I go about reading what you recommended), I should create a broader utilities module in my_app/lib/ directory which I might want to import in my_app/lib/MyApp.pm or perhas my_app/lib/MyApp/Controller/*.pm.

[02:35:41] <krismatrix> Maybe a better question is...when should I create a plugin versus this utility module you recommented?
[02:36:17] <mst> make it a helper if (a) it needs to know about $app (b) it needs to know about the current request's $c (c) you want to be able to call it as a helper in a template

[05:33:18] <krismatrix> I am having an interesting problem. I set a stash in mojo called auth_verified to 1. Then I redirect_to ('/secure/dashboard'); Since dashboard is under the '/secure' umbrella, the function is_logged_in() is called. When I try to access the stash it say uninitialized. But I know it is initialized..Why would the is_logged_in() function not seeing that. 
[05:33:32] <krismatrix> I am not sure what code to share would be helpful..so presently i have shared nothing.
[05:33:40] <mst> krismatrix: redirect_to creates a new http request, the stash is gone
[05:34:02] <mst> that's what the 'redirect' part of the name means
[05:34:55] <krismatrix> hmm...so...i should probably not use stash and instead store auth_verified in a database of some kind and in is_logged_in() retrive the value?
[05:35:23] <mst> when a user gets marked as logged in, surely you'd put that information in the session?
[05:35:37] *** Quits: EvanCarroll (~ecarroll@50.222.187.218) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:36:11] <krismatrix> oh...yes when they sign in. I guess I can use $self->session('auth_verified') instead of $self->stash('auth_verified')
[05:36:30] <mst> I would store a user id in the session
[05:36:40] <mst> it's (by default) a cryptographically signed cookie
[05:36:53] <krismatrix> There already is a userid stored.
[05:37:04] <mst> then why do you need a separate flag?
[05:37:23] <krismatrix> Because TOTP authentication isn't required. So I am creating another flag when the user has verified authentication.
[05:38:18] * mst blinks
[05:38:35] <mst> ok, please explain when it is/isn't required and what you're doing with it?
[05:38:52] <mst> sorry. don't understand your situation well enough to make suggestions yet.
[05:38:59] <krismatrix> no problem.
[05:39:50] <krismatrix> So when a user submits the sign in form...i verify in my PG database the credentials...and if valid, I save a $self->session('username') and redirect to the dashboard.
[05:40:10] <krismatrix> Make sense so far? Do you need me to explain/expand something in more detail?
[05:40:30] <krismatrix> (note..the above does not inclue totP auth).
[05:40:40] <mst> that's fine so far

[05:41:29] <mst> (yes, the code is Catalyst, but turning it into Mojo would be easy)
[05:42:09] <krismatrix> In my effort to implement totp authentication...when the user submits the same sign in form, I go ahead and login. So you are now under the '/secure' umbrella. I have a function that is always called when under '/secure' called is_logged_in().
[05:42:51] <krismatrix> In this function, I pull some field from a PG database and stash it. One such value is 'authuser'. When this flag is set, that means the user has enabled TOTP authentication.
[05:43:09] *** Joins: Su-Shee (~Susanne@152-111-142-46.pool.kielnet.net)
[05:43:51] <krismatrix> I am now checking whether the a new stash field called 'auth_verified' is set. If it is NOT set, then I am telling mojo to always go to the verify_auth.html page. 
[05:44:06] <krismatrix> When the user submits the auth code, then the field is actually set. 
[05:44:17] <krismatrix> i.e auth_verified is 1.
[05:44:38] <mst> if a user has enabled TOTP, surely you should always require TOTP as they log in?
[05:44:43] <krismatrix> But as you stated earlier...because I am doing a redirect_to, the auth_verified is not being passed.
[05:44:50] *** Joins: k33p3r (kexik@2605:6400:c847:1948::8491)
[05:44:53] <krismatrix> correct.
[05:45:08] <mst> ok, so, I propose a simplification then
[05:45:11] <krismatrix> ok
[05:46:51] <mst> if a user has enabled TOTP, on successful user+pass combination the login code should set something like username_pending_totp as a session key instead and then redirect to verify_auth
[05:47:03] <mst> and then once the TOTP is successful, you delete that value and set username
[05:47:45] <mst> the reason for this is it means that in any code that checks $c->session->{username} you can be sure that if it's there then the user is fully logged in
[05:48:10] <mst> which means you don't have to go back to the database to check for TOTP being enabled in every is_logged_in check
[05:49:14] <mst> and also, and this is IMO the important reason, $c->session->{username} always being reliable should make it much harder to make a stupid mistake later and accidentally allow a TOTP bypass
[05:50:02] <mst> note: were I designing this code for -me- to write I'd take that route, simply because when it comes to authentication, the harder it is for me to fuck it up the better
[05:50:41] <krismatrix> I think i follow..although it does mean I need to make a number of changes. sigh..ok..let me get at it.
[05:51:08] <mst> yeah, but since the current code is broken anyway
[05:51:18] <mst> may as well make the changes to do what I just suggested
[05:51:48] <mst> and it's really just 'set a different session key instead of having an auth_verified key'

[05:52:24] <mst> but I hope my policy of "when it comes to auth code, do my best to protect against me being an idiot" is a worthwhile one :)

[07:52:06] <NeoFAT32> Seriously what's the point of making support channel to send people to docs ?
[07:52:41] <NeoFAT32> Hopefully, every hardwares company are not doing this.
[07:52:47] <mst> because the docs explain the problem way better than we have the energy/effort to do so
[07:52:50] <tm604> NeoFAT32: this isn't really a support channel, more of a discussion channel, but put a % before the last $ on line 30

[08:00:08] <krismatrix> I am curious...what does he mean by hardware company? It sounds like he was directed here by someone.
[08:00:59] <rewt> well, perl is hard, so that makes it hardware, right?
[08:02:53] <krismatrix> well..it certainly escalated quick.

[08:06:15] <krismatrix> mst..I think I managed to implement your suggest version of totp entry (from about an hour or so ago). 
[08:06:47] <krismatrix> I will need to do some more robust testing. (the forgot pw system was broken anyway..so i just disabled it to fix it eventually). 
[08:08:21] <mst> krismatrix: login flow really needs lots of tests, yes

[08:09:05] <krismatrix> yes...but writing the tests although a bit frustrating that i 'have' to, are proving very useful in giving me confidence that I don't have broken code.
[08:09:33] <mst> writing tests is bloody annoying, yes
[08:09:49] <mst> but having them to help make sure you didn't break things later is -so- worth it
[08:15:04] <krismatrix> so i recently realized something that I may have been doing that is stupid. Want to clarify this. I have controller files with functions. For example sub authenticator($self). Which is called by the router. This function may call another function called sub qr_code($self). But this is NOT a function that is called by any route.. 
[08:15:41] <krismatrix> 1. Should qr_code($self) be in a separate module and NOT in the controller module?
[08:16:32] <krismatrix> 2. When I call qr_code() within authenticator(), I have been calling it this way: qr_code($self). But I am guess, what I really ought to be doing is call it this way: $self->qr_code();. Would you agree?
[08:16:59] <krismatrix> or does it not matter?

[14:28:09] <Botje> As of December 2021, the decision has not been confirmed by the Council of the European Union.[30] The Council has asked the Commission to produce a detailed impact assessment, but the Commission considers that the onus is on the Member States to find a common position in Council.[31] As a result, progress on the issue is effectively blocked.[32][33]
[14:29:27] <Botje> and it is blocked because some countries prefer winter time, others prefer summer time, and yet others prefer UTC

[21:14:36] *** Joins: Helmholtz1 (~Helmholtz@user/helmholtz)
[21:15:43] <Helmholtz1> I've issued `cpan --help` in a unix system. It guided me for some installation precudure. I chose automatic and `[local::lib]`. It created a `perl5` dir in my $HOME. 1- What did it do? 2- How can I undo it?
[21:16:29] <zgu> 2- rm -r ~/perl5 :)
[21:17:36] <Botje> Helmholtz1: local::lib is a way to install perl modules in your home directory, as the default is somewhere in a system path.
[21:17:37] <zgu> but, what it does is create a directory hierarchy there where you can install perl modules, and if you eval `perl -Mlocal::lib` in your .bashrc it will add environment vars to load perl modules from there
[21:17:52] <Botje> Helmholtz1: it may also have added a line to your .bashrc or told you to. 
[21:18:05] <Botje> (or not, i've not used cpan for a while)
[21:19:06] <Helmholtz1> zgu, Botje thanks...so I only need to purge that directory
[21:19:29] <Helmholtz1> Anyway, I expected `cpan --help` to only print switches not do some installation precedure
[21:19:50] <Helmholtz1> I'm using fish. It didn't mutate bashrc or fish_config
[21:22:03] <zgu> oh it runs the whole setup wizard on --help?

[23:07:26] <genio> Auditors: Please take a screenshot of this app for us.    Me: ok, here ya go.   Auditors: that's great, but we really need that screenshot with a date on it. Can you show the date in your toolbar?   Me: ok, here ya go.    Auditors: that date doesn't contain the year.    Me: let me change the settings on mac to show the year in the date..... FFS, I can't do that, Apple?!?
[23:07:44] <genio> Apple, making simple shit hard in 2022.
[23:08:58] <zgu> but do they let you sow seconds on the clock?
[23:09:01] <zgu> s/sow/show/
[23:09:02] <shaldannon> oof.  also, oof corporate audits
[23:11:48] <waltman> Seems to me if you don't know what year it is, you might have bigger problems than auditors.
[23:12:18] <genio> that's the dumb reasoning someone removed it I guess. The fact that I can't display the date the way I want is just plain dumb
[23:12:56] <zgu> actually MATE's panel clock doesn't support year either
[23:13:09] <zgu> and gkrellm doesn't show it at least by default
[23:14:37] <genio> Apple in 2022: full size keyboards, we'll make people suffer for wanting to use them by still not properly mapping home/end page up/down. Dates, haha.  Mice, we won't let you have mouse control be separate from touch pad controls; you get only one way to scroll and if you don't like it, fuck off.
[23:15:00] <zgu> and only one button
[23:15:02] <waltman> Space on the macOS menu is limited, especially on the new models with the notch.
[23:16:32] <waltman> If you're on a laptop, like most users are these days, there's often not enough space to show everything. I can't fault them for not making the year be an issue.
[23:16:40] <genio> Oh, you want to use Cisco VPN? We'll need you to go ahead and unlock your keychain each time you want to connect. No, we won't allow you to use the fingerprint scanner for that
[23:16:43] <waltman> s/issue/option/
[23:16:59] <genio> waltman: it used to be there in the OS. they actively removed it. 
[23:18:07] <xenu> what you should have done is 1. run 'date' in terminal 2. resize the terminal window so it fits in the taskbar 3. move it there
[23:18:33] <zgu> maybe if they put application menus on the windows themselves like a normal person the system menu bar would have more space
[23:21:33] <Harzilein> zgu: how's that normal?
[23:21:41] <Grinnz> genio: win 10 doesnt let you show the date with a compact taskbar and i'm still annoyed about that
[23:21:45] <gordonfish> genio: Why would they even need the date in the screenshot, when it should be in the image's meta data already??
[23:22:18] <Grinnz> genio: all the more reason i'm not too mad that win 11 might force me to move to full time linux
[23:23:53] <Harzilein> zgu: there's lots of things to criticise about macs, but if you want people to be able to efficiently mouse _unless and until_ they use (ubiquitous) power user shortcuts, sticking the menu on top is the way to go.
[23:24:57] <waltman> Why do they need the year when the OS doesn't even support it? Do they want you to doctor the screenshots?
[23:25:50] <revhippie> take a pic w/ a cellphone in front of the monitor with you holding today's newspaper
[23:25:59] <revhippie> maybe add a blindfold, for flavor.
