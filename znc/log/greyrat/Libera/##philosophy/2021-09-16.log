[03:02:28] <coeus> <coeus>I was about to get banned for talking about conspiracies, so I left, and then it dawned on me the reason why <coeus> The government is basically trying to stop conspirators all the time, that's what representatives do <coeus> so I decided it's best just to let the representatives of government handle it, people talking about it just makes the situation worse and the reason why is
[03:02:28] <coeus> because people like to guess and create theories that don't lead to any kind of formal investigation because they lack fact-based knowledge <coeus> if a person want's conspiracies to be investigated, they need offer proof, otherwise nothing get's done, it's counter-productive to keep talking about it <coeus> Also, calling people in government liars, conspirators is also counter-productive.
[03:02:28] <coeus> After all, how can you expect the conspiracies to be investigated if people doing the investigations are the ones being blamed, interrogated? – 091521 15:07

[03:49:49] <biys> :s/manage/magic/

[03:51:06] <I_Am_M00t> What is this higher order of living you speak of?
[03:51:40] <biys> i should have put it in quotes.  essentially it's the idea that there is a more or less accurate way to live within the world
[03:52:04] <biys> the more accurately yu live within the world is a result of your understanding of the most accurate way to navigate within the world
[03:52:05] <I_Am_M00t> Wow I've heard of this
[03:53:15] <biys> there is behaviour that is quantifiably more or less condusive to promoting success
[03:53:18] <biys> HAH
[03:53:45] <biys> i cast thee out in the name of bill and ted
[03:54:47] <I_Am_M00t> Sounds like you've got it all figured out
[03:55:17] <I_Am_M00t> Is there a manual for this?
[03:55:38] <I_Am_M00t> Maybe the Boble?
[03:55:55] <biys> well, no.  as far as i've understood it's a matter of an idea that the status of a person is likely associated with their education/understanding
[03:56:06] <biys> where in that being wrong is...  akin to sinning
[03:56:18] <biys> which isn't really that big a deal provided you subscribe to the particular narrative
[03:56:21] <biys> or not
[03:57:23] <biys> things are changing... i'd say it's obvious
[03:57:36] <biys> as to say if it's organic in nature is another question
[03:57:49] <biys> but things are definitely changing
[03:58:03] <biys> the burden that is going to fall on businesses soon is going to be significant
[03:58:09] * I_Am_M00t tries to follow along 
[03:58:15] <biys> the idea that the mental health of an employee is the employers responsibility
[03:58:24] <biys> which makes sense to some extent... primarily productivity
[03:58:47] <I_Am_M00t> Woah, so all of a sudden you mixed in a bunch of dubious altright claims?
[03:58:51] <biys> but to wht extent is my business going to expect me to be some way or another based on some metric they've determiend to be the most productive employee?
[03:59:12] <I_Am_M00t> Mmmk I'm a bit sus now, this smells like trojan horse rhetoric
[03:59:49] <I_Am_M00t> Like, first talking about self realization, and then sprinkling in a barrel of altright narratives haha
[03:59:51] <biys> i wouldn't consider it outside the realm of possibilities that an employer would create some kind of wellness clause within their employment agreement requiring you to adhere to a specific type of lifestyle
[04:00:10] <I_Am_M00t> biys: nice try bru
[04:00:51] <biys> well you know there i a more or less approprate way to live within the world
[04:00:54] <biys> and if you aren't living IT
[04:01:04] <biys> you're uncooth
[04:01:28] <biys> i spelled it wrong, it's got a u in it
[04:01:34] <I_Am_M00t> Lol, this is a good Tucker Carlson speech
[04:01:58] <I_Am_M00t> Two completely unrelated topics somehow get married
[04:02:00] <biys> did i even convince you a lttle bit?
[04:02:23] <I_Am_M00t> I mean you convinced me that your mind is disorderly
[04:02:42] <biys> i'm insulted
[04:02:56] <biys> you're victimizing me

[07:06:17] <I_Am_M00t> well, i dont think there's much holding people back from thinking about thought systems that disagree with theirs
[07:06:34] <causative> your prior beliefs don't hold you back from thinking about the thought system
[07:06:38] <causative> they hold you back from actually adopting it
[07:06:49] <I_Am_M00t> you can detach from your own belief system as long as you're not immersed in some everyday situation that require that you use it (your own belief system)
[07:07:04] <I_Am_M00t> adopting a belief system is different from arguing for it or thinking about it
[07:07:14] <I_Am_M00t> i agree, I couldn't seriously adopt any belief system
[07:07:39] <I_Am_M00t> but as long as my tummy is full and my basic needs are met, i can spend free time thinking about things i don't believe in
[07:09:00] <causative> but isn't the reason to do that, to evaluate the attractiveness of adopting that belief system as your own?
[07:09:11] <I_Am_M00t> that's one reason, there are others

[07:53:51] <causative> it is a fact that no knowledge is certain
[07:54:32] <causative> setting solipsism aside, the broadest argument for this is the fact that humans make mistakes, even in purely deductive reasoning; therefore, we can never be 100% certain that any calculation or deduction we have made does not contain any mistakes
[07:55:36] <causative> if you check your work, you can never be 100% certain that you didn't make a mistake in checking it
[07:56:51] <causative> now, you may have in mind certain "exceptions" for very simple deductions - but your mind is a computing machine, and a computer may fail no matter how simple the task
[07:57:54] <causative> whether a neuron fires or not is a stochastic event
[07:58:20] <causative> never a certainty
[08:07:41] <I_Am_M00t> what if i used my line of reasoning to argue for why there is a soul?
[08:08:35] <I_Am_M00t> since we can't know what happens after death, then our memories may carry over to the afterlife/next life (and the conclusions we've drawn that personality and memories are stored in the brain are wrong)
[08:09:34] <I_Am_M00t> basically, it doesn't matter that memories and personality seems to be related to the brain, we can't know for certain, therefore we shouldn't be so quick to believe that we will carry on after death (personality/identity/memories intact)
[08:09:40] <causative> maybe after death we get eaten by pink elephants who leave a body double in our place
[08:09:46] <I_Am_M00t> sure
[08:10:12] <causative> "we don't know what happens" therefore "let's privilege this one specific wishful hypothesis" is not a legitimate line of thought
[08:10:27] <I_Am_M00t> let me stop you there, and take your thought in
[08:10:49] <I_Am_M00t> see I agree with you, but for the sake of argument... why the hell not?
[08:10:53] <I_Am_M00t> :D
[08:11:05] <causative> we don't *know*, but the evidence does favor a particular hypothesis - what science has shown us
[08:11:12] <I_Am_M00t> what if i call you religious for "privileging" the hypothesis that memories/person dies with the brain?
[08:11:29] <causative> there are evidence-based reasons to privilege THAT hypothesis
[08:11:33] <I_Am_M00t> ok, what if I call you religious for trusting the science and dismissing the alternative
[08:12:13] <causative> science is evidence-based, religion is not
[08:12:25] <I_Am_M00t> but wait, what if I disagree
[08:13:13] <I_Am_M00t> because you have no evidence of what happens in the afterlife, why should i accept your evidence based approach?
[08:13:22] <plank> idk if i would say religion isnt evidence based
[08:13:30] <causative> we have evidence that the brain results in the mind
[08:13:31] <plank> more like the evidence that supports religion isnt reproducible
[08:13:34] <causative> damage the brain, damage the mind
[08:13:49] <I_Am_M00t> why is your evidence about present life valid for beliefs about what happens in the afterlife?
[08:14:36] <causative> science gives us a worldview that does not require a separate "afterlife" - Occam's razor then eliminates it
[08:14:49] <I_Am_M00t> what if i reject occam's razor wholly ?
[08:14:56] <plank> occams razor is a heuristic, not a law
[08:14:56] <I_Am_M00t> i just call it a childish toy thought
[08:15:08] <causative> Occam's razor is the most fundamental principle in science
[08:15:15] <plank> ummm
[08:15:29] <causative> "the simplest theory that matches the evidence" is the ultimate standard of science
[08:15:44] <I_Am_M00t> but it's not logically true
[08:15:50] <I_Am_M00t> it's just simple
[08:16:37] <I_Am_M00t> whenever i take a single step, two banana trees appear and disappear, but occam's razor does not detect it :>
[08:16:37] <causative> before you look at any evidence, in Bayesian inference you need a prior distribution over the possible explanations for the evidence
[08:16:49] <I_Am_M00t> all this is basically saying "it's unlikely"
[08:16:49] <causative> this prior distribution comes from Occam's razor
[08:16:55] <I_Am_M00t> occam's razor, bayesian inference, etc
[08:17:03] <causative> before looking at evidence, we assign high prior probabilities to theories that are simpler
[08:17:15] <I_Am_M00t> meh, we're back in step one now
[08:17:22] <causative> yes, of course, everything is about likelihood
[08:17:31] <causative> anything is possible - but not everything is equally likely
[08:17:38] <I_Am_M00t> i am saying i reject the idea of probabilities, and you use probabilities to argue for why probabilities are good
[08:18:01] <causative> you have to abandon the security blanket of "certainty" - it is an illusion.  You cannot get it, you must make do with what you have, which is probability.
[08:18:03] <I_Am_M00t> solipsism doesn't give a damn about probabilities
[08:18:59] <causative> if you want to be rational, then I can discuss that
[08:19:05] <causative> if you want to be irrational, no one can persuade you otherwise
[08:19:30] <causative> to have a dialectic we need to presupposition that both participants are willing to engage rationally as well as they are able
[08:20:47] <causative> if there are *rational* reasons to discard probabilities - okay, we can talk about that.  But if your position is to just reject all forms of evidence, probability included, and to believe whatever you want... then there's no persuading you of anything
[08:21:01] <I_Am_M00t> exactly
[08:21:04] <causative> and we can't talk about it
[08:21:08] <I_Am_M00t> exactly...
[08:21:10] <causative> so there's no point in you talking about it
[08:21:15] <I_Am_M00t> well idk about that
[08:21:23] <causative> unless you're just trying to troll
[08:22:03] <I_Am_M00t> well, I think a lot of solipsism is either actual trolling or depressed people misapplying solipsism
[08:22:11] <I_Am_M00t> which is kinda my point, it's horseshit
[08:22:30] <causative> well, don't caricature a belief you don't hold, then
[08:22:42] <I_Am_M00t> why not? i stated that this was what I was doing, lol

[08:23:23] <I_Am_M00t> yup
[08:23:45] <causative> actual solipsists - if there are any - probably do not reject all forms of evidence or reason
[08:24:00] <I_Am_M00t> but that's kind how solipsism is used irl
