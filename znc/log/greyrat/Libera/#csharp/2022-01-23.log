[00:00:00] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i got that upgraded controller for my ender but i'm almost afraid to install it because i have everything working now
[00:00:22] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Haha same. I also have no reason to make it quieter now.
[00:01:49] <JakeSays> now i'm gonna do some web development in c++
[00:02:35] <MatthiasVance> Client-side?
[00:02:50] <JakeSays> no
[00:03:07] <JakeSays> doing a web site in c++
[00:03:18] <_genuser_> I thought you were joking.
[00:03:24] <JakeSays> lol nope
[00:03:31] <_genuser_> you're seriously doing web dev in c++ on the server side?
[00:03:36] <JakeSays> yup
[00:04:02] <_genuser_> oh man that's arch specific too and os specific.
[00:04:30] <Nasp> JakeSays:  you write your esp32 stuff in c++?
[00:04:36] <JakeSays> _genuser_: well, in this case that is true, but that's not true in general
[00:04:39] <JakeSays> Nasp: i do
[00:04:58] <_genuser_> I remember writing c++ service side code, we moved from regular linux/pentiums to solaris/sparcs and it all stopped working.
[00:05:52] <JakeSays> Nasp: there's not many alternatives
[00:06:17] <JakeSays> _genuser_: this web site is running on a microcontroller.
[00:07:48] <Nasp> JakeSays:  C#?
[00:08:08] <JakeSays> Nasp: not on an esp32
[00:08:25] <_genuser_> JakeSays nice.
[00:09:06] <JakeSays> well, that nano project thing might support the esp32
[00:09:43] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Sure just use nano framework
[00:09:47] <Nasp> YEah it does
[00:10:10] <JakeSays> eh, i'd rather use c++
[00:10:17] <JakeSays> or rust
[00:11:27] <JakeSays> Nasp: i might be more interested when they support generics
[00:11:35] <Nasp> c++ or rust?
[00:11:37] <Nasp> Or nano
[00:11:40] <JakeSays> nano
[00:25:17] <Suchiman> JakeSays: heretic, you should be using HolyC
[00:25:24] <JakeSays> wtf is that

[03:27:09] <JakeSays> Nasp: i'm not sold on the shape though
[03:27:33] <Nasp> BTW I looked at them locally and the price starts at 10 dollars
[03:27:33] <Slade> JakeSays, how many axis cnc are you getting

[03:29:11] <Nasp> Nope 13 dollar stating price locally
[03:29:13] <Slade> JakeSays, well you'll have to do the price to capability tradeoff.  axis and materials are the easiest to trade
[03:29:37] <Slade> and size of course
[03:29:54] <JakeSays> Slade: i'll probably just start with enough to mill pcbs
[03:30:07] <Slade> so like a 3axis?
[03:30:25] <JakeSays> yeah
[03:30:32] <JakeSays> basically a modified 3d printer
[03:30:40] <JakeSays> that's probably what i'll end up doing

[19:23:54] <MatthiasVance> Yes I think the issue is with Cura sending it
[19:24:05] <MatthiasVance> Because it's a command it sends first
[19:24:38] <MatthiasVance> The first time it didn't seem rammed in but today it looked *BAD*, so much pressure on the bed the springs went all in

[21:32:55] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: yeah. had that happen with bltouch on that printer
[21:33:33] <Nasp> Doesn't it still have an end stop?
[21:33:36] <MatthiasVance> no
[21:33:43] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: the issue isn't cura
[21:33:47] <MatthiasVance> oh, shit
[21:34:25] <MatthiasVance> I mean I was okay with it malfunctioning every once in a while (like erroring out with no harm), I am going to buy a smart socket for that
[21:34:52] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Do you know what the issue is?
[21:35:01] <JakeSays> yes. firmware.
[21:35:18] <MatthiasVance> bah
[21:35:29] <MatthiasVance> I was hoping I could run stock for a looooong time
[21:35:31] <JakeSays> this is exactly what happened with mine
[21:35:56] <MatthiasVance> Is there a PR for a fix somewhere so I can be sure I have it?
[21:36:01] <MatthiasVance> Or should I just go with latest Marlin?
[21:41:40] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i dont know. i just stopped using the bltouch and went back to original firmware
[21:41:51] <JakeSays> i'm going to try again with the new controller
[21:42:10] <MatthiasVance> ah shit
[21:42:28] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i even tried other people's firmware builds
[21:42:31] <MatthiasVance> New controller as in, you'll upgrade from 4.2.2 to 4.2.7?
[21:43:21] <JakeSays> yes
[21:44:24] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: about openscad, there isn't such a refresh option. also, the builtin editor sucks ass
[21:45:22] <MatthiasVance> What editor do you use? VS Code?
[21:45:36] <JakeSays> yeah
[21:45:56] <JakeSays> there's an option in openscad to have it monitor for file changes and refresh
[21:46:28] <MatthiasVance> So the first design I did fit perfectly. Other than fucking up a centering formula :D
[21:46:39] <JakeSays> one of these days i'm going to write a language server
[21:47:54] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i recommend this library: https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2
[21:48:04] <JakeSays> the docs are excellent
[21:48:36] <MatthiasVance> Oh cool, thanks
[21:50:55] <MatthiasVance> "I removed the black and white BLtouch wires from the connector, and connected them to the motherboard's Z-stop jack instead, and haven't had this issue ever since. Apparently there is something wrong with the Ender 3 v2's BLtouch jack."
[21:51:05] <MatthiasVance> That's an idea
[21:51:20] <JakeSays> oh interesting
[21:51:27] <JakeSays> huh
[21:51:43] <JakeSays> i should install that controller today

[21:58:14] <MatthiasVance> I might, need to first buy some wiring ;)
[21:59:00] <MatthiasVance> Or I can manually level once in a while? Found that to be tiresome because I wanted to do it *every time*
[21:59:16] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: that's what i do
[21:59:32] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: but even with bltouch i dont level every time. fuck that.
[22:00:13] <JakeSays> printing is already too slow
[22:00:49] <JakeSays> that was actually what brought me to octoprint - the ability to level when i wanted to
[22:02:09] <MatthiasVance> How does OctoPrint help with that?
[22:02:50] <JakeSays> by allowing me to control when the bltouch leveling is done.
[22:03:16] <JakeSays> otherwise you do it via gcode from cura, and it happens with every print
[22:03:17] <MatthiasVance> Ahh when you were still using it
[22:03:33] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ah. no my other printer has bltouch as well. i use it there

[23:20:12] <Nasp> I've been wanting to try out gitlab as a buildserver

[23:21:25] <ap5> Nasp, the biggest benefit is that you dont have your kubeconfig added to your ci/cd server :) Instead you add a connection from argocd, to your gitlab instance with a ssh key
[23:21:45] <ap5> I have it hooked up to my gitlab. It is pretty nice
[23:22:08] <Nasp> Oh so you use both argocd and gitlab?
[23:22:18] <ap5> Yes
[23:22:40] <ap5> Nasp, i have described my build pipeline here: https://bl0g.dev/post/flytte-dag/
