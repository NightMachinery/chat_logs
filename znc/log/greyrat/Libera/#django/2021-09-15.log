[00:03:02] <Jhin> Guys I'm in training mode here. Got a database with "task", this task can only belong to one user so its a ForeignKey(User, ...), but I want this task to have multiple "tags". So I make a new Class Task: name = charfield, user = foreignkey(user, ...). But I also want this task to have just one Group, but I dont want to connect this "Group" with
[00:03:02] <Jhin> "Task" by a foreignkey, because deleting the group force me to delete the Task. I was thinking connect it by a manytomany field, and ony allow the user to choose one option. Got any advice?:)
[00:03:45] <Jhin> correction: "So I make a new Class TAGS: name = charfield, user = foreignkey(user, ...)."

[00:44:41] <Jhin> CodenameTim I am not sure how that works, let me check it out
[00:47:52] <Jhin> CodenameTim like this?
[00:48:01] <Jhin> class Task: group = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
[00:48:34] <Jhin> class Group: user = models.ForeignKey(User, ...)    name: models.CharField(...)
[00:53:41] <Jhin> or I could just somehow remove() or clear() relationships of the Group with Tasks, when attempting to delete Group. But not sure how to code this.
[00:54:27] <Jhin> I would have to dive into the DeleteView methods and override it

[05:56:18] <FunkyBob> nedbat: you might need to add some exception rules into the .htaccess for static and media roots...
[05:57:27] <FunkyBob> alternatively, it's not difficult to teach uwsgi to serve your static in offload threads... but really, you have apache _right_ _there_! :P

[10:21:15] <FunkyBob> ok
[10:21:36] <FunkyBob> but the template changes you made suggest you didn't quite understand how it worked.
[10:21:57] <golden_ticket> Exactly
[10:22:34] <FunkyBob> any tutorial that launches straight into class-based views is going to confused newcomers, IMHO
[10:22:44] <FunkyBob> you miss learning how a view works
[10:22:52] <golden_ticket> Yeah
[10:22:59] <golden_ticket> This one already is more direct
[10:23:58] <FunkyBob> 15 years of revision and refinement goes a long way :P

[10:57:18] <dorf> Hi, translations of dynamic content, is that an option? Like translating product names pulled from a database?
[10:58:24] <serafeim> dorf: yes
[10:58:36] <serafeim> use django-modeltranlation
[10:58:55] <serafeim> works good have used it in various projects
[11:02:53] <dorf> serafeim: But if im not using django models, how would i do it then?
[11:03:37] <serafeim> what do you use instead of django models ?
[11:04:00] *** Quits: pbrunier (~pbrunier@84-24-22-131.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[11:04:21] <dorf> I have an external database used by many other things too, model is written in sqlalchemy for djang.
[11:10:23] <FunkyBob> can't you describe it with django models, and access it as a second DB?
[11:10:32] <FunkyBob> do you have the translations stored anywhere?
[11:12:04] <dorf> It's a really big database, and would prefer not to have to write and maintain the model files twice. I don't have translations for the data in the database now, need to write them
[11:12:59] <FunkyBob> understandable... there once was a lib that would reflect one model definition into the other system... can't remember which way it went
[11:13:46] <FunkyBob> the question becomes where do you want translation to occur
[11:13:52] <FunkyBob> in templates? in an API? somewhere else?
[11:14:10] <golden_ticket> FunkyBob: This tutorial is MUCH better than the one I was using before

[11:14:49] <FunkyBob> golden_ticket: perhaps because this one was designed to teach you django, and the other to build a blog...
[11:14:56] <golden_ticket> lol
[11:15:32] <serafeim> golden_ticket: the django tutorial is the best ever
[11:15:44] <serafeim> also the django docs are the best documentation i've ever read.
[11:16:01] <dorf> FunkyBob: i would prefer to have all translations done in django, everything else is translated there right now. I was hoping for something like django being able to pull the possible values for a variable in a translated string and then translate those.
[11:16:03] <serafeim> nothing comes even close to how good the django docs are
[11:16:04] <golden_ticket> serafeim: that's great news tbh. I never read docs because they're usually horse sh*t
[11:16:23] <serafeim> golden_ticket: i've read *all* the django docs (back in django 1.4) from start to finish
[11:16:35] <golden_ticket> Must read like a book then
[11:17:03] <serafeim> golden_ticket: do that but after you acquire some experience with django. don't do it without doing soem projects first
[11:17:30] <FunkyBob> dorf: yes, but "in django" is rather vague
[11:17:40] <FunkyBob> all of my points before were still "in django"
[11:18:30] <FunkyBob> golden_ticket: once you finish the tutorial, I recommend you read over the docs contents page, to get an idea of what other features there are to learn

[16:18:20] <moldy> maybe apollo13 knows something
[16:20:10] <Kim^J> nedbat: That depends on what it's used for.
[16:20:41] <nedbat> Kim^J: i understand this isn't an actual concern. My code wasn't either, but a shallow security scan flagged it  because it used md5
[16:21:02] <Kim^J> nedbat: To answer the question "Have the contents of this file changed?" it's perfectly valid to use MD5.
[16:21:12] <nedbat> Kim^J: i understand.
[16:21:30] <Kim^J> In the context of "Update cache, yes/no?"
[16:21:34] <nedbat> Kim^J: i'm trying to explain: i know it's not a security issue.
[16:21:55] <nedbat> Kim^J: but there are "security scanners" that examine source code, and when they see "md5", issue a warning.
[16:22:09] <Kim^J> Because they are crap and doesn't understand context.
[16:22:43] <nedbat> this happened to coverage.py: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1198
[16:22:53] <nedbat> Kim^J: right, they are crap. Have none of them flagged django?
[16:23:43] <moldy> nedbat: probably they did but the django security team decided that django doesn't have to care :)
[16:24:03] <kezabelle> tbf, they probably _should_ flag md5, given FIPS
[16:24:05] <Kim^J> ^ Yeah I'm guessing that
[16:24:15] <Kim^J> kezabelle: Why?
[16:24:25] <nedbat> moldy: maybe the crap scanners asked django about it before they put it on the bad list.  no one asked me before they added coverage.py to the bad list.
[16:24:26] <moldy> i got emailed by a university today because i have a repository called "dotfiles" on github and they think this might be a security issue...
[16:24:36] <nedbat> moldy: i got that email too :)
[16:24:51] <moldy> nedbat: :) what's that bad list?
[16:24:52] <kezabelle> Kim^J: because calling MD5 will just crash outright under such things IIRC.
[16:25:05] <Kim^J> Why?
[16:25:18] <kezabelle> security :)
[16:25:45] <Kim^J> But it's not a valid concern given the context.
[16:25:52] <DnzAtWrk> md5 has its place
[16:25:54] <kezabelle> that's the point
[16:25:55] <DnzAtWrk> but not in security
[16:26:00] <nedbat> moldy: something from here: https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db/issues/2335
[16:26:02] <DnzAtWrk> good for file verification
[16:26:05] <kezabelle> it needs context to decide whether or not it's valid
[16:26:25] <Kim^J> DnzAtWrk: That's the thing you shouldn't use md5.
[16:26:30] <kezabelle> hence python got "usedforsecurity" argument, and I think md5+usedforsecurity=false won't crash
[16:26:32] <moldy> not sure if FIPS compliance is a goal for django. you can always implement your own cache backend / not use the file-based one
[16:26:36] <DnzAtWrk> why, you only care if a file is corrupt
[16:26:41] <DnzAtWrk> hardly matters what method you use
[16:26:45] <DnzAtWrk> md5 is as good as any
[16:27:26] <Kim^J> Oh, you're talking about "Did my file on my disk change?"-verification
[16:27:34] <DnzAtWrk> yes
[16:27:34] <Kim^J> Not file transfered across the internet verification
[16:27:35] <kezabelle> moldy: perhaps not, but there's a patch open for allowing it to work for md5 at least
[16:27:44] <DnzAtWrk> storing a hash together with a large file
[16:27:48] <DnzAtWrk> so you can check if corrupt
[16:27:50] <Kim^J> Gotcha
[16:27:53] <Kim^J> Then yes, md5 is fine
[16:28:02] <moldy> kezabelle: what exactly are you talking about here? some automated fips-checker or such?

[16:28:55] <kezabelle> moldy: well, _I'm_ specifically saying that automated scanners are probably _right_ to flag md5 precisely because they don't know the context. An unfortunate side effect of that (as with all such automations) is the number of false positives, of course

[16:33:09] <moldy> kezabelle: ah, there are "FIPS kernels", TIL :)
[16:33:20] <kezabelle> ah, sorry, jajaja :)
[16:34:33] <kezabelle> basically, given the absence of a usedforsecurity=x type flag, the software (or scanner) can't intrinsically know you're not being a fool, and rightly (annoyingly) wants to inform you that md5 is bad-news-bears.

[16:35:55] <kezabelle> in an ideal world, by adding the flag, the system doesn't preclude your using it (you opted in knowing it wasn't security sensitive) and scanners would be robust enough to report only those where it was ambiguous or dangerous, I guess.

[19:50:47] <amrooting> I am using custom user but on password change form, i want just two form fields old_pass and new_pass1 -- not needing new_pass2 https://dpaste.org/0KKc but the problem is that, password validation stops working... meaning it accepts password of 3 characters instead of minimum 8. how can i fix this please
[19:57:32] <dang`r`us> reading the source often helps
[19:57:43] <dang`r`us> and/or step thru with debugger

[20:02:02] <amrooting> dang`r`us, i have read the souce, PasswordChangeForm is a subclass of SetPasswordForm and that is subclassing forms.Form and no password validation was used in that class
