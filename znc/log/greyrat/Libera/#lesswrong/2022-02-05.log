Either unexpectedly good, or unexpectedly bad. But, instaed what I got was exactly what I expected, a fishy flavor and lot of salt. Boring.
[01:50:23] <zebrask> As usual my recommendation is to recommend corn on pizza.
[01:50:37] <quanticle> Corn on pizza, huh? I'll try it
[01:51:14] <quanticle> Though it does seem a bit weird to be stacking starch on starch like that.
[01:51:35] <zebrask> I remember it being extremely unusual to me when I first tried it, but now it feels so natural that I am mildly surprised that other people find it unusual.
[01:51:36] <zebrask> It does have some of the features of pineapple on pizza, though. It's crunchy and slightly sweet.
[01:52:11] <zebrask> My understanding is that it's extremely common in Korea, though I've never been.

[01:54:38] <gwern> careful 'Girl A' doesn't cut your throat with a razor while you sleep
[01:54:38] <zebrask> Maybe you and I have different thresholds for crunchiness? Both corn and pineapple are a bit fibrous, and when you bite into the skin of a corn kernel it kinda pops in a way that I associate with mild crunchiness.
[01:54:48] <nshepperd2> tfw all the anti-pineapple on pizza people were just forgetting to peel the pineapple first and going 'why is this crunchy and lacerating my throat'
[01:54:50] <zebrask> But yeah it's not crunchy like a dorito.

[03:38:57] <Robomot> Pizza effect - Wikipedia (In religious studies and sociology, the pizza effect is the phenomenon of elements of a nation's or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported to their culture of origin,[1] or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources.[2])

[03:39:58] <spxtr> "The original pizza was a simple, hot-baked bread without any trimmings, the staple of the Calabrian and Sicilian contadini from whom well over 90% of all Italo-Americans descend. After World War I, a highly elaborated dish, the U.S. pizza of many sizes, flavors, and hues, made its way back to Italy with visiting kinsfolk from America. The term and the object have acquired a new meaning and a new status, 
[03:40:04] <spxtr> as well as many new tastes in the land of its origin, not only in the south, but throughout the length and width of Italy."

[04:18:20] <Robomot> Harsanyi's Social Aggregation Theorem and what it means for CEV | LessWrong [Kaj_Sotala on 6 Jan 2013 6:43 UTC: [“Axiom 1: Every person, and the FAI, are VNM-rational agents.”] [...] [“So why should you accept my axioms? Axiom 1: The VNM utility axioms are widely agreed to be necessary for any rational agent.”] Though of course, humans are not VNM-rational.] (A Friendly AI would have to be able to …)
[04:18:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Only a VNM-rational agent can have preferences in a coherent way, so if we’re talking about aggregating people’s preferences, I don’t see any way to do it other than modeling people as having underlying VNM-rational preferences that fail to perfectly determine their decisions." ... that's exactly right, and therefore...

[04:21:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "A Friendly AI would have to be able to aggregate each person’s preferences into one utility function. The most straightforward and obvious way to do this is to agree on some way to normalize each individual’s utility function, and then add them up. But many people don’t like this, usually for reasons involving utility monsters. If you are one of these people, then you better learn to like it, because according to
[04:21:35] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Harsanyi’s Social Aggregation Theorem, any alternative can result in the supposedly Friendly AI making a choice that is bad for every member of the population."

[06:31:27] <pie_> well yes but I'm also salty because in the natural sciences department (which includes physics, which was my initial attempt at a degree) you just talk to the teacher, get their OK, fill out a form, and youre in
[06:32:04] <adiabatic> my hunch is that there's a lot of computer guys who think "I got this" and turns out they don't got this

[06:32:27] <pie_> adiabatic: well yes
[06:33:21] <pie_> adiabatic: but the thing is its not even that the teacher said im not qualified, its that the policy is they only agree to it if youre supposed to finish the next semester but would be blocked on something
[06:33:54] <adiabatic> Hm. There's gotta be a reason for that. I wonder whom you could ask.
[06:34:06] <pie_> my general approach is "there must be a good reason for this"
[06:34:24] <pie_> there is no good reason for this policy that i can think of, except maybe something having to do with not haing enough teachers
[06:34:46] <pie_> that doesnt make sense either, but the best hypothesis i have is its somehow supposed to stop extra people from registering since they dont have neough spots anyway
[06:34:46] <adiabatic> 'shortage of CS teachers' is probably it

[06:44:37] <spxtr> if you do very well in CS then that's not terrible, that's about what I had and I paid it off within a few months of working at FMAGA.
[06:44:56] <spxtr> if you don't do well in CS such that you can't get a good job out of university then that level of debt can be completely crippling
[06:45:18] <pie_> but its really frustrating that I cant buy hardware or anything else, i mostly just cover my basic living expenses and spend too much mental (health )capacity on my familys bullshit
[06:45:37] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:45:58] <pie_> hm.
[06:46:15] <pie_> so yeah, im not big brain enough to not feel like im screwed or at least in a constant tar pit
[06:47:03] <pie_> spxtr: isnt FMAGA a hellhole (as just posted previously)
[06:47:27] <spxtr> I had a good time there, and the comp was excellent.
[06:47:34] <pie_> hm
[06:47:46] <spxtr> ymmv, ofc
[06:47:59] <pie_> well im kind of screwed in that regard too now that i think about it
[06:48:31] <pie_> unless i somehow get a remote job, i have to move my mother to a new city, and im just glad i finally have her health network built out here and the situation stabilized
[06:48:46] <pie_> (shes schizo, got her a doc and stuff)
[06:48:48] <spxtr> there's a lot more remote jobs these days
[06:48:52] <pie_> yeah
[06:49:34] <pie_> god I really wish I could just focus on university
[06:49:48] <pie_> well anyway
[06:50:00] <pie_> semester starts on monday
[06:50:09] <spxtr> taking anything fun?
[06:50:44] <pie_> not praticularly, but im finally trying to figure out networking so im not always "how does babby x"
[06:50:48] <pie_> its going ok
[06:51:23] <spxtr> my networking class was excellent but I still feel like I don't understand most of the internet.
[06:51:32] <pie_> oh we only have a few decent electives but its basically a dice roll to find out if you get a spot
[06:51:56] <spxtr> they usually give priority to older students, no?
[06:52:04] <pie_> maybe
[06:52:36] <pie_> more like everyone rushes to register, the spots fill up instantly, and maybe they make a spot if it not getting in will block you from graduating
[06:53:58] <pie_> i have networking, algo&data structures, and "database systems" whatever that will mean here, and programming 1 (last semester we had "introduction to programming"), the only elective i managed to get is 3d printing but im not sure how interesting that will be
[06:54:13] <pie_> all in all the classes last semester were not particularly hard
[06:54:22] <pie_> 10 years of infosec adjacent tinkering helps
[06:54:46] <spxtr> programming 1 and algo/data structures are the most important for getting a job
[06:54:53] <pie_> (if someone would have pointed me to somehalf decent textbooks on operating systems 5 years ago that would have helped more(
[06:56:34] <pie_> im not belittling their importance
[06:57:21] <pie_> they killed my motivation with the administrative crap. if they let me take one or two more courses i feel like id be running on adrenaline all semester
[06:57:38] <pie_> (which admittedly sounds dangerous :P)
[06:57:55] <pie_> ah well whatever
[06:58:07] <adiabatic> if you think you have too much free time, go lift weights and eat more protein or something
[06:58:24] <pie_> i surely have some form of executive dysfunctoin
[06:58:47] <adiabatic> try exercise then
[06:59:09] <adiabatic> a good 1-hour walk is surprisingly effective at restoring mine
[06:59:14] <spxtr> yeah, exercise is the way to go. also friendship
[06:59:34] <spxtr> go on jogs/to the gym with your friends
[06:59:34] <adiabatic> actually it was the second hour of that one walk that really did it for me
[06:59:39] <pie_> 50% percent of my problems come from the family crap but i just cant get rid of that
[07:00:12] <pie_> thats probably most of my unnecessary mental load and distractability i think
[07:01:02] <pie_> I go to a psychologist but it doesn't seem to help that much - Im not doing a very good job of helping me help myself
[07:02:39] <pie_> spxtr: ok honestly, maybe networking *is* kind of fun, but it's also tedious
[07:03:29] <pie_> also one of the multiple choice exam questions last year had a subset consisting of basically: did some guy come up with some thing in 1961 or 1962?
[07:03:37] <pie_> and im like....are you fucking kidding me?
[07:05:37] <spxtr> that sounds bad.
[07:06:03] <pie_> the rest of the questions are _surely_ saner. I didn't check yet
[07:06:13] <pie_> even if its not a representative subset, who cares?
[07:08:00] <pie_> s/who cares?/, still.../
[07:12:02] <pie_> I imagine you have some decent savings then <spxtr> ehh I'm 29 and I'm back in school and loving it :)
[07:12:10] <pie_> iven the FMAGA
[07:12:15] <pie_> *given
[07:12:31] <PapuaHardyNet> pie_, wow is this an undergrad experience? Sounds painful
[07:12:38] <gwern> pie_: listen, those SF closets and 4-foot tall _Alien_ sculptures aren't free
[07:12:38] <pie_> PapuaHardyNet: it is now
[07:12:47] <pie_> gwern: heh tru
[07:13:16] <spxtr> yeah, decent savings. I made more in from GOOG stock increasing in value than I was paid by Stanford last year
[07:13:16] <pie_> PapuaHardyNet: the physics dept was nice and chill modulo me being bad at studying and failing lots of classes due to the above
[07:13:39] <PapuaHardyNet> so you have moved to CS from physics??
[07:13:56] <pie_> yeah, I just finished the first CS semester
[07:13:58] <pie_> got all As
[07:14:04] <spxtr> if you're failing physics classes then leaving for another department is 100% the right thing to do.
[07:14:07] <pie_> that probably says more about the degree than my abilities
[07:14:17] <spxtr> I know a few people who tried to stick with it despite early Fs, and it only gets much, much harder
[07:14:24] <pie_> spxtr: well if I had good judgement I should have done that ages go
[07:14:35] <pie_> eh, I did decent in the beginning
[07:14:43] <PapuaHardyNet> that's how they get you
[07:14:47] <pie_> haha
[07:15:35] <pie_> a large portion of the problem was mental health based distraction and more-interested-in-the-computer-than-studying-distraction and tfw-no-gf-negativity
[07:15:58] <spxtr> yeah I'm gonna recommend exercise, again
[07:15:58] <pie_> Im pretty sure I could have done a lot better 
[07:16:09] <pie_> if I invested the effort inthe right direction
[07:16:35] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, the tfw-no-gf negativity used to get me turing my first and second year too
[07:17:32] <pie_> in recent times there were some times when I wasn't overloaded with bullshit / managed to make enough mental space for myself and I was thinking "Wait...is this what getting work done or making progress / kinda being able to focus feels like? What the hell?"
[07:17:32] *** galambo_ is now known as galambo
[07:17:35] <galambo> hi
[07:17:38] <pie_> o/
[07:17:50] <spxtr> if you're skinny-nerd then just a few months of weight lifting will make you noticably more attractive
[07:17:53] <pie_> so that must be some sort of proof that there is something wrong with me
[07:18:25] <pie_> well, I kind of have a girlfriend right now (nothing is ever simple with me :P), and it has helped (damn biology)
[07:18:40] <pie_> but the rest of the system overloading is still there
[07:19:27] <pie_> I just feel really behind
[07:22:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So, backlinks. I'm looking and /Lorem and I'm not seeing any backlinks. I guess... nothing links to /Lorem? If so, can you do something about aht
[07:22:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> *that
[07:23:51] <pie_> I started taking another look at bash after giving my classmates an 8 hour workshop before the exam - I got sufficiently annoyed at not having a good enough understanding of a bunch of things. Luckily they didn't need much beyond pipelines and simple commands. <adiabatic> pie_: is how-to-bash new to you?
[07:24:09] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: /Lorem is specifically backlisted for backlinks because I didn't want testing infrastructure links cluttering up backlinks elsewhere since /Lorem links so much but never in a way a user will ever give a damn about (aside you I guess)
[07:24:29] <adiabatic> pie_: actually there's a lot there that's kind of new to me and better explained here than anywhere else (sad!)
[07:24:43] <gwern> (I can remove the blacklisting but aren't there a bazillion other backlinks to test on)
[07:24:45] <pie_> adiabatic: I may have misparsed something; im not sure what you mean
[07:25:13] <adiabatic> pie_: you didn't. I thought there was a lot of basic bullshit but there's lots of advanced stuff there as well
[07:25:23] <adiabatic> this latter realization only came much later
[07:25:35] <pie_> this is linked off the wooledge guide btw
[07:25:47] <pie_> sadly the guy only seems to have finished the first three chapters of this new version
[07:26:22] <pie_> ive taken a couple superficial attempts at trying to understand the order of expansions but its still not clear lol
[07:26:43] <pie_> bash info is frustratingly scattered and bash is frustratingly finicky
[07:26:55] <pie_> but there are some decent info sources if you start looking (and asking #bash)
[07:27:14] <pie_> the one i linked also has excercises, which im curious to get to
[07:27:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: That seems like a reason to blacklist it from being a source of backlinks, but why should it be blacklisted from being a target? Or is it just not straightforward to exclude only in one direction
[07:28:00] <pie_> its also somewhat validating that, though i didnt know a lot of the details, my explanations seem to have converged to a somewhat similar construction as this guide
[07:28:42] <pie_> https://www.aosabook.org/en/bash.html
[07:28:43] <Robomot> The Architecture of Open Source Applications: The Bourne-Again Shell
[07:28:50] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I didn't see any reason to include the blacklisted at all and it was less to think about. I'm not sure if it would be complicated or bad, I haven't thought about it or looked at the code much
[07:29:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ok fair enough, I'll test on another page I guess
[07:29:21] <pie_> despite reading all this i dont feel like I really learned anything though. Which is more about me than the quality of the text :/
[07:29:44] <pie_> or at least its technical content
[07:29:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> pie_: Don't bother, bash is dumb and learning anything about it beyond what you need to get something done is a waste of time
[07:30:09] <pie_> well, I keep thinking that and yet it shows up everywhere
[07:30:14] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:30:19] <pie_> for some value of everywhere
[07:30:38] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[07:30:44] <pie_> i fumble with python otherwise
[07:31:49] <pie_> that and I'd better have a clue if I start teaching it to someone...
[07:32:50] <adiabatic> I missed part of the conversation, but I agree that bash is not a worthy scripting language
[07:33:13] <pie_> <pie_> well, I keep thinking that and yet it shows up everywhere
[07:33:13] <pie_> <pie_> for some value of everywhere
[07:33:14] <adiabatic> that said, its instructional materials are ungodly piss-poor so some formal training in it might be actually beneficial
[07:33:17] <pie_> thats all you missed
[07:33:18] * gwern signs up for 1dollarscan's $100/month membership. time to start using up those '100 sets'
[07:33:33] <pie_> adiabatic: which formal training are you thining of right now
[07:33:38] <adiabatic> reading that one site
[07:33:41] <pie_> ah ok
[07:34:07] <pie_> i was going to say the course way just a bit beyond babbys first practicalcommand-line
[07:34:56] <pie_> poor guys probably have no idea what the point was
[07:35:10] * quanticle hears "bash is not a worthy scripting language"
[07:35:23] * quanticle bursts through the wall
[07:35:30] <adiabatic> powershell is much better
[07:35:33] <adiabatic> powershell is worthy
[07:35:35] <quanticle> "Can I interest you in our lord and savior, PowerShell"
[07:35:55] <quanticle> :D
[07:35:56] <pie_> haha, dabbling in PS is on my bucket list but ugh
[07:36:01] <pie_> also PisS
[07:36:04] <pie_> also microsoft
[07:36:12] <quanticle> PowerShell is open source!
[07:36:14] <adiabatic> powershell is very much worth learning if you happen to find yourself on a Microsoft stack
[07:36:16] <pie_> and runs on linux
[07:36:20] <pie_> but im a masochist anyway
[07:36:26] <pie_> so i want to learn the microsoft stack too
[07:36:31] <pie_> adiabatic: right
[07:36:34] <quanticle> I mean, I'll be honest, now that I'm on Linux, I just use bash
[07:36:38] <adiabatic> that is a big fucking if, though
[07:36:53] <quanticle> One of these days I'll install PowerShell for Linux and switch my default shell
[07:37:07] <pie_> i was trying to reverse engineer som c#/mono stuff earlier
[07:37:30] <adiabatic> quanticle: tell me all about it. occasionally I need to run something that doesn't have fish integration (nvm) and I want to hear about someone else who's even more of a shell deviant than I am
[07:37:52] <pie_> :'D
[07:37:55] <quanticle> I'll do it, but probably not this weekend
[07:38:16] <adiabatic> version managers seem to be hardest hit for this
[07:38:41] <pie_> spxtr: id really like to do half decent in a compilers class
[07:38:41] <adiabatic> if you don't have shell integration for a version manager, you're kind of up the creek without a paddle
[07:38:50] <pie_> parsers are kind of annoying though
[07:39:04] <adiabatic> how are you writing parsers?
[07:39:14] <pie_> ideally? parser combinators
[07:39:41] <pie_> i havent figured out the bison/yacc/whatever stuff yet
[07:39:52] <quanticle> adiabatic: nvm, rbenv, etc, are one thing. They're... probably doable if you do the configuration yourself. What I'm afraid of is having to deal with Python's virtualenv on PowerShell, on Linux
[07:40:10] <adiabatic> yeah, good fucking luck
[07:40:35] <pie_> quanticle: what does it need to do other than load env vars?
[07:40:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> virtualenvs are the work of the devil
[07:40:55] <adiabatic> pie_: the only style I've ever done (and I'm bad at it) is Pratt parsers, as shown in https://interpreterbook.com
[07:40:55] <Robomot> Writing An Interpreter In Go | Thorsten Ball (This book takes you from 0 lines of code to a fully working interpreter for the Monkey programming language. Step by step. All code shown and included. Fully unit tested.)
[07:41:15] <pie_> adiabatic: i keep wanting to do that book ugh, never get around to it :Pit looks fun
[07:41:19] <quanticle> pie_: I don't know; I should really look at venv/bin/activate one of these days
[07:41:47] <pie_> adiabatic: oh right and at one point i finally figured out the basic hand-written parser style, which i dont remember if it is or is not what happens in there
[07:42:03] <adiabatic> pie_: I keep getting halfway through it. It's fun. The author is clearly enjoying it all, which is nice for something that might be dry as hell
[07:42:22] <pie_> when I was younger compilers were the biggest magic
[07:42:25] <adiabatic> pie_: AFAICT Pratt parsers are a long-lost DIY technology that was forgotten in the 60s
[07:42:52] <pie_> adiabatic: if you can find something that explains to me wtf its actually doing that would be nice haha
[07:42:59] <pie_> like, algorithmically speaking
[07:43:14] <pie_> as opposed to 5 different implementations in 5 different language paradigms
[07:44:02] <pie_> its been all of...i guess two or three months since i poked at it. huh.
[07:44:07] <adiabatic> pie_: Ball does it in his book. I could've sworn I used his techniques for something else.
[07:44:09] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I wouldn't go so far. Virtualenvs are like... antibiotics to treat venereal disease. Yes, we can all agree that, in an ideal would, one ought to have been more careful and designed a package management system that could handle multiple versions of the same package in the package cache. After all, even NodeJS (NodeJS!!!!) got this right. But, now that we find ourselves in this
[07:44:11] <quanticle> unfortunate situation, well, it's better to have the treatment (virtualenv), than not.
[07:44:34] <adiabatic> also, I remember Hejlsberg (the C# and TypeScript guy) saying that modern compiler writing is nothing like what you might learn in college; compilers these days need to have really good error recovery because most code fed to compilers these days is half-broken because compilers are called as part of IDEs like VS Code, and most times it has a syntax error
[07:44:39] <pie_> adiabatic: oh wait i was thinking of crafting interpreters
[07:45:16] <pie_> adiabatic: oh intersting
[07:45:20] <pie_> that makes sense
[07:45:30] <pie_> adiabatic: would be nice to have so i can quoteit
[07:45:45] <adiabatic> agreed. I think I saw him say it on a video somewhere. Good luck.
[07:45:51] <pie_> dang
[07:46:34] <pie_> adiabatic: i suppose its not https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSdV1M7n4gQ
[07:46:35] <Robomot> Anders Hejlsberg on Modern Compiler Construction - YouTube (00:34:10) (Originally published on Channel 9The way this story starts is pretty interesting: one day in the lunch room in building 25 I happened to have a chat with the...)
[07:46:46] <adiabatic> that title looks VERY familiar
[07:46:58] <adiabatic> the original publish place ALSO looks very familar
[07:47:00] <adiabatic> it's probably it
[07:47:08] <pie_> its literally called modern compiler construction so eh :D
[07:47:26] <pie_> I googled hejlsberg good error recovery
[07:47:37] <pie_> dunno how this ended up the first result but google works in mysterious ways
[07:47:41] <quanticle> Huh, building 25? I used to have lunch in building 25. That was the best cafeteria on the Microsoft campus, IMO
[07:47:54] <pie_> (does it index youtube speech to text or something?)
[07:48:01] <quanticle> It might
[07:48:05] <adiabatic> pie_: yes, and it's very good
[07:48:10] <adiabatic> Google can provide live transcripts now
[07:48:16] <adiabatic> of, like, Google Meet calls
[07:48:20] <pie_> can I have that for my classes
[07:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: It's like a treatment that doesn't and can't cure the patient and leaves him free to continue spreading the infection, when the correct response is to kill the patient and burn his corpse and salt the ground with nuclear weapons
[07:48:33] <pie_> can i pipe my phone mic into it thanks?
[07:48:50] <quanticle> Well, also there might be transcripts/closed captioning. I know for technical talks, sometimes they upload captions for disabled viewers.
[07:48:57] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: do you have a least hated shell
[07:49:06] <quanticle> pie_: You might be able to, actually

[07:49:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: I use bash. I don't want to think about shells, honestly.
[07:49:53] <adiabatic> sensible
[07:50:08] <quanticle> I've tried it. It's not as good as YouTube's live captioning, but it does a good enough job at transcribing voicemails to allow me to get a sense for what the person is asking.
[07:50:19] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: do you just use zsh on macs new enough where that's the default, or do you not have any OS X installs that new?
[07:50:32] <Obormot\Gaia> Don't think I do
[07:50:37] <Obormot\Gaia> When did they make zsh the default?
[07:50:53] <adiabatic> Uh, like, mid-2020 or the release before that?
[07:50:58] <quanticle> Catalina
[07:51:02] <Obormot\Gaia> Ok yeah I have nothing that new
[07:51:06] <adiabatic> hah

[07:57:26] <galambo> quanticle, I actually like the kerning on that graphic

[07:58:13] <pie_> adiabatic: now that I think about it, I haven't done much in terms of writing compiler backends. The easiest actually usable thing I imagine is to shove some s-expression syntax on the frontend if I dont want to spend too much effort on being neurotic about the frontend not being all nice for current-pet-language-project :P
[07:58:30] <galambo> its like oh yeah baby we are metric we dont care about rules no more

[08:21:51] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: what is so hard about venv? It will take you 15 minutes to learn it
[08:23:55] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Nothing is wrong with venv (well, nothing aside from everything that's been mentioned above). The problem isn't venv, the problem is that I was talking about switching my default shell to PowerShell. On Linux.
[08:24:54] <quanticle> Virtualenv does install a PowerShell shim... but only on Windows, as it turns out.
[08:26:22] <quanticle> If you want to get venv working with PowerShell on Linux, you're looking at reimplementing venv/bin/activate in PowerShell on Linux. Now, in theory this shouldn't be difficult. As pie_ pointed out, it shouldn't be more than setting a bunch of env vars. But it still seems like kind of a hassle.

[08:32:04] <pie_> the thing is activate is usually sourced isnt it?
[08:32:34] <pie_> idk what other state exists in bash - functions in scope, traps, ...?
[08:32:44] <pie_> idk if activate would need any of those
[08:33:01] <PapuaHardyNet> just use zsh
[08:33:03] <quanticle> Yeah, whereas on Windows, you don't source the activate script, you run it. You run venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
[08:33:04] <pie_> but if it doesnt, you shouldnt need to do anything fancy other than passing the env vars over

[10:02:32] <adiabatic> actually interesting: https://github.com/henb13/jre-missing/blob/acd651fbfc4c0d0057a166c2e0806d190facac84/README.md?plain=1#L9

[10:03:15] <PapuaHardyNet> main is now the default branch name for github
[10:04:01] <adiabatic> sure, it'll twist your arm into using it even for preexisting repos, but still
[10:04:43] <PapuaHardyNet> that is one reason why I use codeberg now
[10:05:14] <adiabatic> No dark mode. Sad!
[10:05:32] <PapuaHardyNet> the second reason is that github deleted my pseudonymous account I used for making github issues and comments, and the third reason is that codeberg is very privacy friendly
[10:06:16] <PapuaHardyNet> (I actually use a self-hosted gogs instance for version control mainly - codeberg is just for publicly facing repos)
[10:11:44] <quanticle> Wait, it'll arm-twist you into making 'main' the primary?
[10:11:50] <quanticle> I haven't had that experience.
[10:12:27] <quanticle> I created a new repo on Github, ran `git init` locally, set the remote and pushed, with `master` as the primary branch
[10:12:32] <quanticle> And it worked fine
[10:12:38] <quanticle> No complaints
[10:13:20] <PapuaHardyNet> they've tracked you enough to know that you are a model minority
[10:13:45] <adiabatic> quanticle: maybe they stopped adding in a line in their instructions that makes the most important branch `main`
[10:13:53] <adiabatic> I just…don't run that line
[10:14:33] <adiabatic> maybe they stopped putting it in the "copy and paste this to get your repo up in GitHub" instructions, and now those shell commands are just two lines of stuff instead of three
[10:15:00] <quanticle> Oh, I don't think I've followed Github's copy-paste instructions on setting up a new repo in years.
[10:15:08] <PapuaHardyNet> when HR sees your Github repository uses "master" and not "main", you shall reconsider :<
[10:15:44] <quanticle> Bro, at work we have at least 50 repos (yay microservices!) all on a private Gitlab, all with 'master' as the primary release branch
[10:15:44] <PapuaHardyNet> well, potential employers
[10:15:55] <quanticle> Not every employer is woke
[10:15:56] <rsaarelm> Same here, I just use github as a free backup and publishing server for CLI repos and don't use the web interface for anything.
[10:16:48] <PapuaHardyNet> have you tried sourcehut btw? you can create a remote without using the web interface
[10:17:22] <PapuaHardyNet> that is just so cool - I know of no git forge software that allows this, aside from sourcehut (well, remote git without a frontend except git-web does not count)
[10:17:33] <spxtr> I started using sourcehut recently. It's pretty spiffy. Long live email patch lists.
[10:18:05] <quanticle> I think Obormot and saturn2 use sourcehut, right? For greaterwrong?
[10:18:09] <quanticle> Or am I misremembering?
[10:18:12] <PapuaHardyNet> they do?
[10:18:28] <adiabatic> I already have a gitlab account that I barely even use, so I'm not too keen on getting a third git host account
[10:18:31] <spxtr> it's on github

[10:18:48] <Robomot> GitHub - kronusaturn/lw2-viewer: An alternative frontend for LessWrong 2.0
[10:19:44] <spxtr> adiabatic: but sourcehut is even better than github and gitlab... because at some point it will become not free (as in beer, still free as in freedom)
[10:19:52] <quanticle> Ah, never mind. It's not sourcehut, it's https://repo.or.cz/

[10:20:06] <quanticle> Greaterwrong
[10:20:10] <rsaarelm> The non-githubs are probably more likely to just go under and take the repos with them. Maybe github will start censoring things, but if you just want to make some neat shell script, forget about it, and have it still be around 30 years later, github has a shot of being around.
[10:20:11] <PapuaHardyNet> adiabatic: you'll have to pay for an account at sourcehut
[10:20:16] <spxtr> it being sourcehut
[10:21:08] <rsaarelm> A site created by some rando to be a better github is going to go down when people stop caring about maintaining it if it doesn't have big org momentum going.
[10:21:32] <spxtr> it already has pretty nice momentum, I can definitely see sourcehut lasting for a long time

[10:21:44] <spxtr> it'll always be somewhat niche on account of how opinionated the founder is

[10:22:31] <quanticle> Not very censorable
[10:22:46] <quanticle> He runs his own infrastructure. Rather like Ben Thompson (Stratechery)
[10:25:05] <adiabatic> does he say anything worth censoring, like how xenoestrogens in the water are making the frogs hermaphroditic?
[10:25:16] <quanticle> Well, he is a Mormon
[10:26:24] <quanticle> But, no, most of his writing is either pointing out how conservatives theories of American decadence and decline fail to account for decadence and decline in other industrializing and industrialized economies, or China
[10:26:56] <quanticle> Also he writes about government bureaucracy
[10:27:27] <quanticle> Now, normally I'd say that's pretty cancel proof, but in this day and age, who can say? He doesn't write memeworthy content, so I think that's some insulation.

[10:51:55] <quanticle> Big org momentum isn't all it's cracked up to be
[10:52:40] <quanticle> Yeah, small sites can die from disinterest and running out of money, but so can big org initiatives. Google Plus had all the big org momentum in the world, until it didn't.

[10:53:52] <spxtr> ah yes, I remember hating it
[10:54:01] <quanticle> I was working at a company that was all-in on making a Silverlight application as a replacement for their web UI, about three months before Microsoft announced that Silverlight development was ceasing and that the platform would be deprecated.
[10:54:19] <spxtr> flash was already going out of favor, and then silverlight came along
[10:54:47] <quanticle> Yeah, that was right around the time when Steve Jobs was killing Flash by saying that the iPhone wouldn't support it.
[10:55:24] <quanticle> And people were asking, "Okay, well, how fucked is Adobe, as a result of this?" Spoiler: not fucked at all
[10:55:33] <spxtr> I loved flash, fwiw. It was obviously terrible for so many things, but I loved the flash games and animations and such
[10:55:37] <spxtr> plus it's the first thing I ever pirated
[10:56:23] <quanticle> Other examples: Twitter's API
[10:56:31] <saturn2> then google just turned the whole browser into flash anyway
[10:57:48] <quanticle> I'm convinced that Google Scholar only continues to exist because it's running on a server in out-of-the-way closet in Mountain View that everyone's forgotten about.
[10:58:07] <spxtr> if google scholar dies, academia will be in a really bad spot
[10:58:16] <spxtr> everyone I know uses it heavily
[10:59:21] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, google scholar for physics stuff
[10:59:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I was wondering whether I was extremely incompetent for never using google scholar until I remembered that
[11:00:49] <spxtr> I should be careful saying "academia" when I mean "physics academia" :)
[11:04:33] <spxtr> no, I shouldn't be careful. physics academia is the best academia
[11:04:56] <quanticle> It's one of the few academias without a replication crisis
[11:05:17] <spxtr> definitely not as bad as some, but there have been some high-profile retractions in the last few years
[11:05:47] <spxtr> if you want maximum cringe, watch "The Race: How To Build A Quantum Computer"

[11:06:18] <PapuaHardyNet> what's the cringe?
[11:06:29] <spxtr> came out very shortly before his most important work was completely discredited and retracted

[11:09:53] <PapuaHardyNet> you know that this doesn't really help right? dark mode doesn't change the amount of blue light coming from your screen

[11:18:48] <quanticle> Well, it was mostly stuff about making things keyboard accessible, actually.
[11:19:01] <quanticle> And structuring our markup so that it sounded right in a screen reader
[11:22:19] <PapuaHardyNet> you work at microsoft? what product do you work on?
[11:22:23] <adiabatic> makes sense
[11:22:31] <PapuaHardyNet> let's hope it isn't win11 :P
[11:22:46] <quanticle> Used to
[11:23:02] <adiabatic> the most interesting bit of accessibility feedback I saw was "the order that all these [tweet] elements is read out in is weird"
[11:23:06] <quanticle> I left like... wow, it's already been four years
[11:23:26] <PapuaHardyNet> what do you do now?
[11:23:34] <quanticle> Still a programmer
[11:23:42] <quanticle> Just in a cold place rather than a rainy place
[11:24:04] <PapuaHardyNet> won't it get harder and harder to find a programming job as you get older?
[11:24:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not if you take care to insinuate your technology of choice into everything
[11:24:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then disparage people who are trying to learn it
[11:25:45] <PapuaHardyNet> well, windows 11 is ubiquitous, that is for sure
[11:25:53] <quanticle> Mmm... not necessarily? I mean, sure if you get stuck on a particular technology stack, then you might be screwed, but I think I've done a good job of staying up to date.
[11:25:56] <adiabatic> none of my computers run it
[11:26:17] <adiabatic> didn't want a TPM way back when
[11:26:30] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: I meant more like - the older you grow and the more experience you gather, the more money you command, or should command, for your services
[11:26:55] <quanticle> I feel like Windows 11, at this point, is much less ubiquitous than Windows 10, simply because Windows 10 is acceptable, in contrast to Windows 8, which was most definitely not.
[11:27:03] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Why?
[11:27:04] <PapuaHardyNet> you'll eventually price yourself out of the market of programmers because the salaries of programmers are constrained by the salaries of executives (mostly) and managers (usually)
[11:27:32] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: you don't want to earn more and more for the amount of value you generate?
[11:27:48] <quanticle> Not really? I make way more money than I know what to do with already.
[11:27:58] <quanticle> I just shove it all into index funds and try not to think about it.
[11:28:10] <quanticle> Yeah, more money would be nice, but I'm not poor, and I have no debt.
[11:28:18] <quanticle> And I have frugal tastes
[11:28:32] <adiabatic> get married and have kids
[11:28:41] <quanticle> adiabatic: Fuck off, you're not my mom
[11:28:54] <adiabatic> :P
[11:28:56] <PapuaHardyNet> adiabatic: this is exactly what I was thinking for quant, but lacked the directness to say it hahah
[11:29:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder if a significantly higher amount of second-generation Indians choose to eschew marriage as a way of rebelling against their culture.
[11:29:51] <quanticle> Doubtful
[11:30:00] <adiabatic> quanticle: the difference between…well, ONE of the differences between her and me is I'll say it only once :P
[11:30:03] <quanticle> All my mom's friends' kids are married and most have kids.
[11:30:10] <quanticle> adiabatic: Hahahaha
[11:30:15] <quanticle> Well, that is appreciated
[11:32:13] <saturn2> second generation indians are just turning into atomized bugmen along with everyone else
[11:32:47] <adiabatic> saturn2: you forgot oppressed brahmin SJWs
[11:32:56] <quanticle> Anyway, with regards to aging, one of my inspirations was a fellow programmer on my team at Microsoft, when I was there. He was about 60 years old, got started punching holes in paper tape, but when I was there he was one of the best Javascript programmers I knew. (He was also a climate-change denying Trump supporter, but that's neither here nor there) Anyway, it was when I met him that I
[11:32:58] <quanticle> though, "Yeah, you know what? I *can* do this for the rest of my life."
[11:33:21] <adiabatic> Trump supporters, inspiring the next generation! Many such cases!
[11:34:09] <quanticle> saturn2: First of all, I'm not *technically* a second generation Indian and second of all just because *this* Indian has turned into an atomized bugman doesn't mean that you need to disparage everyone of my race
[11:35:57] <saturn2> like i said, it's happening to everyone
[11:36:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I think the "along with everyone else" means literally everyone in US, which makes it a kind of positive note as in saturn2 implies assimilation
[11:36:32] <adiabatic> ehhhhhhh
[11:36:58] <adiabatic> I'm not in favor of assimilating to stupid
[11:46:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd love to be a US citizen tbh. US is the best place to be in if you want to establish yourself as an AI researcher
[11:47:32] <PapuaHardyNet> the majority of the rat and EA community members are in the US too, which is a huge social benefit for US people in our community
[11:52:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> But is it a benefit
[11:52:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, if you like increasing your chances of becoming a crazy Bay Aryan
[11:54:05] <adiabatic> I dunno
[11:54:11] <adiabatic> my chances are pretty low
[11:54:57] <PapuaHardyNet> of being a Bay Aryan or a US citizen

The drift diffusion model deconstructs performanc...)
[17:07:02] <two2thehead> "Forced-choice performance validity tests are routinely used for the detection of feigned cognitive impairment. The drift diffusion model deconstructs performance into distinct cognitive processes using accuracy and response time measures. It thereby offers a unique approach for gaining insight into examinees’ speed-accuracy trade-offs and the cognitive processes that underlie their performance. The current study is the first to perform suc
[17:07:02] <two2thehead> h analyses using a well-established forced-choice performance validity test. To achieve this aim, archival data of healthy participants, either simulating cognitive impairment in the Word Memory Test or performing it to the best of their ability, were analyzed using the EZ-diffusion model (N = 198). The groups differed in the three model parameters, with drift rate emerging as the best predictor of group membership. These findings provide initial 
[17:07:03] <two2thehead> evidence for the usefulness of the drift diffusion model in clarifying the cognitive processes underlying feigned cognitive impairment and encourage further research."
[17:09:15] <two2thehead> "The drift diffusion model, proposed by Ratcliff (1978), is an innovative model that may prove useful in increasing our theoretical understanding of feigned cognitive impairment and clarifying performance on an individual level. The model breaks down performance into distinct processing components by simultaneously considering both accuracy and RT measures."
[17:09:20] <two2thehead> rt = response time
[17:15:51] <two2thehead> It thus addresses the speed-accuracy trade-off that is manifested in examinees’ performance, while clarifying the cognitive processes underlying it. More specifically, the diffusion model assumes that simple forced-choice decisions are made after a noisy information accumulation process (Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008; Voss et al., 2013). The information accumulates over time toward one of two response criteria (i.e., boundaries). When the proces
[17:15:51] <two2thehead> s reaches a boundary, the corresponding response is initiated. As shown in Figure 1, the model has three key parameters (Alexandrowicz, 2018; Forstmann et al., 2016; Lerche & Voss, 2018; White et al., 2010)
[17:18:34] <two2thehead> "Drift rate (v) - The rate at which information is accumulated. A stronger drift rate (i.e., the arrow in the figure is steeper) indicates that the process is likely to reach the threshold in a shorter amount of time. Higher drift rate values, thus, indicate that the process is faster and ends more frequently at the correct threshold. It is affected by the characteristics of both the task and individual (e.g., easier trials and higher intelligence 
[17:18:35] <two2thehead> lead to higher drift rates). Regarding recognition memory, drift rate represents the quality, or strength, of the match between a test stimulus and memory trace. In other words, it represents the input from memory into the decision system (i.e., high values indicate that the match allows for a fast decision, while those close to zero indicate increased reliance on guessing)"
[17:24:27] <two2thehead> "Boundary separation (a) - The amount of information used to make the decision (e.g., wide boundaries signify that a large amount of evidence must accumulate before a decision is reached). Thus, instead of representing the speed of information accumulation (i.e., drift rate), boundary separation is related to the examinee’s confidence in the choice that is being made (i.e., degree of cautiousness). In recognition memory, adopting a conservativ
[17:24:27] <two2thehead> e response style increases boundary separation, reflecting the need to collect more evidence to reach a decision. This results in a longer time course to reach one of the two thresholds but will produce more accurate responses. It therefore represents the speed-accuracy trade-off."
[17:26:37] <two2thehead> "Starting point (z) - The a priori bias or preference for one or the other choice alternative. If an individual is biased toward a response, their starting point will be closer to the corresponding boundary and less evidence will be required to make that response. Consequently, the responses at that boundary will be faster compared with the other one."

[18:18:01] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, the Inclusionism issue is an annoying one. it's a section link, so the auto-generated ID includes the anchor as 'id="gwern-in-defense-of-inclusionism-new-regimes"'. but I merge & delete all anchors, so they collectively point to /In-Defense. but of course, when the list of callers gets written out, now it's just '/In-Defense' and '#anchor' has been forgotten.

[19:30:56] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: man, I'd love to setup a NAS but the entire idea seems so overwhelming. get the right mobo, get the right case, ugh
[19:31:55] *** Joins: Nivim (~Nivim@174-24-73-242.clsp.qwest.net)
[19:32:07] <PapuaHardyNet> and I'm loathe to throw money away by buying a freenas WD NAS setup that costs 250% what it should actually cost
[19:32:26] <feep> PapuaHardyNet
[19:32:46] <feep> I was running my nas for actual years by attaching six usb hard drives to my regular computer.
[19:33:04] <feep> it ran like shit, sure, but it really doesn't need to run *fast* to be worthwhile
[19:33:32] <feep> and like sure, now I have a dedicated mobo and an optimized power supply but it's extra, it's not necessary.
[19:34:17] <feep> (fun note: it's still shit! cause this board does not into staggered spin-up, so as a result I'm p sure every time I boot it up it browns out a little, because those drives are taking a little too long to spin up to be normal)
[19:35:19] <feep> (otoh, in normal operation it's really efficient, very low power, and it doesn't matter cause the drives themselves pull like 80% of my power anyways)
[19:35:43] <feep> (and so it still comes out to 65W sustained)
[19:36:23] <two2thehead> wait, why would it not start up properly?
[19:36:46] <feep> two2thehead: drives pull way more power in spin-up than they do in regular operation
[19:37:03] <feep> this is why usually boards do staggered spin-up, one drive at a time, but for some reason it doesn't work for me
[19:37:12] <two2thehead> ah, the difference between powering-up vs maintaining the on state. Gotcha
[19:37:32] <feep> also this is my power supply https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B0045IXKTQ/

[19:37:35] <two2thehead> i assumed it was always on
[19:37:49] <feep> it is, effectively, it spins up like twice a year
[19:38:30] <two2thehead> alright
[19:38:38] <feep> like, that's not a part of my psu, that is it. that is the entirety of it :D
[19:39:00] <two2thehead> :-)
[19:42:41] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: you attached six separate external hard disks to your computer? how did you set up a zfs pool or whatever on it?
[19:42:47] <feep> eight :D
[19:42:55] <feep> oh wait yes, originally six
[19:43:21] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: idk, there wasn't a problem, I just grabbed the zfs kernel driver and manual and put in the commands that made a zfs pool.
[19:43:59] <feep> as opposed to raid, zfs is not in any way coupled to external hardware, ever, it's just a software setup.
[19:44:24] <feep> I just googled "create zfs raid-z2 pool" and did that
[19:44:56] <feep> (my first google hit https://www.svennd.be/create-zfs-raidz2-pool/ )
[19:44:57] <Robomot> Create ZFS Raidz2 pool – SvennD
[19:45:01] <PapuaHardyNet> yep, raid requires special hardware, but zfs doesn't. It does require a lot of RAM though!
[19:45:08] <feep> not really
[19:45:32] <feep> this used to maybe be true but I've never had an issue with a like, 8G 16G computer, unless you turn on dedup or sth the ram use of zfs is vastly overstated
[19:45:58] <feep> and sure, nowadays I'm feeding it 32GB of ECC RAM cause I got a job and can actually dump like a month's wages into a storage setup
[19:47:00] <feep> zfs "requires ram" in the sense of "for optimal performance"
[19:47:17] <feep> a lot of common wisdom is "you won't get the best out of it unless" rather than "you absolutely need to".
[19:47:34] <feep> like how people go around saying zfs needs ecc ram. tosh! complete nonsense!
[19:47:57] <feep> you won't get some safety guarantees of zfs unless you use ecc ram, but it's no worse at dealing with ram corruption than any other filesystem.
[19:48:57] <feep> and at the end of the day, I'm accessing this thing over nfs. so while I splurged a bit, I firmly believe I wouldn't even *notice* if my ram was way lower
[19:49:37] <feep> and half of the ram is being used for feepbot anyways XD
[19:50:06] <feep> (because feepbot is written in a *very* old dialect of D, and if you think the gc is shit now, just imagine how it was fifteen years ago.)
[19:50:29] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds great! that means I can begin my investment in a nas by simply buying more 2.5" hard disks
[19:50:34] <feep> yep
[19:50:55] <feep> and with usb hard drives, they're *usually* "a regular hard drive plus a tiny usb controller"
[19:51:04] <feep> so you can just open them up if you're switching to a nas
[19:51:21] <PapuaHardyNet> so I can simply buy a huge external hard disk instead and buy a usb controller separately huh. 
[19:51:32] <feep> well, more like
[19:51:41] <feep> that is *what* you are buying anyways
[19:51:44] <PapuaHardyNet> there's a limit to how huge 2.5" hard disks are - which means I need to go 3.5" - but they require power supplies
[19:51:59] <feep> so you can usually eventually throw away the controller if you're switching to an internal bus, ie. sata
[19:52:23] <feep> you probably don't want to diy the usb controller, because it's not obvious to me which way around is cheaper
[19:52:26] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: synced

[19:54:52] <PapuaHardyNet> and cheap too tbh
[19:55:14] <PapuaHardyNet> (no I'm not joking, compared to the prices I've seen for similar setups, this is cheap)
[19:55:16] <feep> of course it's silly, cause this board can only exactly run eight hard disks, and that only by sacrificing the only pci slot
[19:55:39] <feep> otoh, finding an 8-drive board was already almost impossible for consumer tech
[19:55:57] <PapuaHardyNet> wait, that thing supports 5 hard disks, not 8
[19:56:07] <feep> yeah as said, I have two~

[20:04:00] <feep> and the hub I used was usb2.0 lol.
[20:04:34] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: that one also looks nice, but I wanted one with a nice underpowered onboard cpu
[20:06:00] <feep> also mine let me use those cool-ass weird drive plugs

[20:08:02] <feep> I only wish it had 10g networking.

[20:12:23] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: this was during testing, before I put it in the case https://i.imgur.com/p3o2JQx.jpg look how neat it is!
[20:12:24] <Robomot> image/jpeg (4096x3072; 1.3 MB)
[20:13:10] <feep> so it's just one of those fat cables going to each dock
[20:15:51] <feep> <feep> watching the iostat on the new pool, whose disks are not misaligned and hence throughput limited, is vaguely hilarious <feep> it's like, write bandwidth: 0, 0, :yawn:, 0, 0, 0, 500MB, 0, 0, 0 <feep> meanwhile source pool is just doing its very level 70MB/s best 
[20:16:06] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: oh yeah! important advice, make *sure* your zfs member disks are aligned properly
[20:16:15] <feep> it needs to be 2048 bytes, not 512.
[20:16:41] <feep> this is not something that can be easily fixed later

[21:02:06] <PapuaHardyNet> is this a good state or a bad state to be in? specifically, is this actually good to solve problems due to the irrational grit, or are you bashing your head in the wall and this state is actually bad for solving problems?
