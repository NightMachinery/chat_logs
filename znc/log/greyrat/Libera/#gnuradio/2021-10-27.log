[03:19:44] <flash[m]> is it a bug or a feature that gr::hier_block2::disconnect( basic_block_sptr ) doesn't handle an empty pointer well?
[03:24:20] *** Quits: goldrak (~goldrak@bl16-27-108.dsl.telepac.pt) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[03:24:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> My general approach is that if it’s cheap to check against invalid pointer you should do so. But in general Userland APIs cannot be checking the sanity of their callers all over the place.
[03:25:41] <flash[m]> given that "delete(0)" and "free(0)" are both safe, and that "disconnect(ptr)" is (I think?) analogous to that kind of tear-down, I naively assumed it was safe
[03:25:54] <flash[m]> (ok, I just coded a bug and don't want to take responsibility for it)
[04:02:02] <willcode4[m]> Yah, but try `free(1)`. I don't think we're going to do significant arg checking in GR.
[04:05:32] <flash[m]> given that `0` is defined in C++ to be whatever value the operating system/compiler assigns to a null pointer (or the keyword `nullptr`) I don't see how `free(1)` is a meaningful comparison
[04:08:08] <Hash[m]> <drmpeg> "That's what I thought. So it's..." <- Just playing with it a bit more, if I transmit the FM radio signal capture I can set the TX gain to maximum and don't see any spike, seems the spike is the result of not sending any data but setting the gain higher. So my bursty data has the transmitter turned on but only bursting once a second so I see that huge spike.
[04:09:05] *** Quits: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[04:09:15] <willcode4[m]> We could make every API call safe for null pointers, but it wouldn't help at all if there's bad pointer, or a previously deallocated object. Plus, having the program continue silently after the caller makes a bad call isn't helping anyone.

[07:46:33] <Hash[m]> <Hash[m]> "So for anyone following my..." <- Spoke too soon... This was using the BladeRF to transmit and also receive... Seems the receiver within the BladeRF completely cancels out the DC spike, now that i'm back home the spike still shows up on the B200 when I use it as the receiver.
[07:58:19] *** Quits: pcero (~pcero@187.135.226.136) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[08:00:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> B200 and BladeRF 2.0 use the same RF Chip. I’m both cases DC cancellation is handled by that chip as far as I know.
[08:32:30] <Hash[m]> Yea, but here is what I am seeing. USRP B200 is being used to receive the waterfall shown in both cases. In the first image, B200 is also the transmitter, in the second image the BladeRF is the transmitter. Everything else about the flowgraph is the same except I add a multiply block before the BladeRF to but the values way down (~0.014). You can see the massive red line in the middle of the BladeRF image.

[16:16:58] <Reventlov[m]> hello
[16:17:15] <Reventlov[m]> Still trying to have gr-ieee802-15-4 working on a brand new ubuntu 20.04
[16:20:53] <Reventlov[m]> the compilation and installation of gr-foo and gr-ieee802-15-4 went ok (in my book), I ran make install / ldconfig, the blocks are listed by gnuradio, but trying to execute e.g. the transceiver_OQPSK fails with messages such as "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foo'".
[16:22:12] <Hoernchen> the blocks being listed only means gr can find the block description, so at runtime the actual block might be missing..
[16:43:53] <BarryDuggan[m]> Reventlov: have you followed https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/ModuleNotFoundError ?
[16:55:13] <Reventlov[m]> As I didn't get this kind of error message (it's only in the console, not in a window like this), no.
[16:55:37] <Reventlov[m]> I will try.
[17:16:44] <Reventlov[m]> Actually i don't see how this can help since this pages is about putting the GNU Radio install prefix in your PATH, and there is no problem with this
[17:40:46] <BarryDuggan[m]> Reventlov: It's your PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH that count here.
[17:42:37] <Hash[m]> <Reventlov[m]> "Actually i don't see how this..." <- I also start GNURadio from a command line and not via the Ubuntu icon because it doesn't load the proper paths when I use the icon
[17:48:05] <muaddib[m]> <Hash[m]> "I didn't try a lot of that stuff..." <- I see what you’re saying about this. Not a lot of versioning in their codebase. We’re spoiled with GNURadio and gr-… packages where versions are well maintained (for the most part). I looked at the most recently committed host files  (June of this year I believe) and there’s definitely DC offset tuning available for the newer gen. May be some work to get it exposed to GR though. 
[17:49:04] <Reventlov[m]> <Hash[m]> "I also start GNURadio from a..." <- Yeah I run it from the CLI too, but… the sudo make install from gr-ieee-802-15-4 should take care of putting everything where gnuradio is expecting them, no ?
[17:49:50] <muaddib[m]> muaddib[m]: you could try a named pipe into GNURadio and replace the source block with a file source. The. Run the cli app into the named pipe. That will work as a test to see if the dc spike is removed at runtime in the flowgraph . I suspect it will. 
[17:50:04] <Hash[m]> muaddib: Yea, I would expect this package to take care of everything for the BladeRF 2.0 because commits from 4 months ago...  https://github.com/Nuand/gr-bladeRF
[17:50:56] <Hash[m]> Interesting about the cli into a named pipe, hadn't considered that
[18:02:42] <Reventlov[m]> btw when I was describing this problem, I was saying python2.7 was installed on the machine. Turns out it's installed as a dependency of gnuradio.
[18:11:13] <Reventlov[m]> so unsurprisingly, following https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/ModuleNotFoundError didn't change anything
[18:14:32] <Reventlov[m]> here are the steps I followed on a clean Ubuntu 20.04 : https://0x0.st/-nzW.txt

[18:20:37] <Hoernchen> well where is the module? is that the actual path to your module?
[18:21:55] <Reventlov[m]> Well the module is in /usr/local/lib/, but I followed the link from Barry Duggan to the letter
[18:25:33] <Hoernchen> you have to djust the paths to whatever you're actually using..
[18:26:20] <Reventlov[m]> Well it's what I said in my previous messages ("Actually i don't see how this can help since this pages is about putting the GNU Radio install prefix in your PATH, and there is no problem with this")
[18:29:04] <BarryDuggan[m]> Reventlov: where is folder `gr-foo` located? is it in /home/remy/SDR ?
[18:29:04] <BarryDuggan[m]> if you run `env` from a terminal, what do PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH say?
[18:30:27] <Reventlov[m]> Hoernchen: so yeah, adding the path of the compiled .so to the variables, it now works. But the wiki page is not asking to do that, at all. And I would expect the make install from gr-foo (for example) to put everything where it should, or have specific instructions on the matter. Thanks.
[18:30:37] <Hoernchen> wel
[18:30:38] <Hoernchen> l
[18:30:58] <Hoernchen> the problem is that packages ususally go to /usr/ while your own compiled stuff goes to /usr/local
[18:31:10] <Hoernchen> only the former is part of the default os paths
[18:31:39] <Hoernchen> you you can either chose to modify the install location and drop the local part and maybe cause a mess with other packages or fix up your own paths
[18:31:51] <Hoernchen> it's just linux, not gr specific.
[18:32:39] <Hoernchen> i supppose the wiki page might need updating
[18:34:09] <schneider> Reventlov[m]: try to replace /usr with /usr/local in export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python3/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
[18:35:01] <Reventlov[m]> yeah, i'll try to edit the wiki page to reflect this
[18:42:50] <Hoernchen> there are also edge cases where your gnuradio is a distro provided package, but you're building a module for that yourself, so you still need to add paths
