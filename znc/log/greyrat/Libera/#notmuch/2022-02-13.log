[00:16:31] <bluejaypop> bremner, i'm trying now something like: notmuch tag +newsletters -new +unread  -- from:newsletter* and tag:new
[00:17:22] <bluejaypop> it seems working now
[00:17:32] <bluejaypop> i needed the and tag:new hehe
[00:17:41] <bremner> OK. I'd escape that *, just to be sure
[00:18:06] <bremner> right, new is nothing special, just another tag as far as notmuch is concerned
[00:19:55] <bluejaypop> bremner, yea.. now i need to figure out why my neomutt is not showing all the emails tagged in my virutal-mailbox but at least now is working the tags as expected
[00:19:58] <bluejaypop> thank you

[00:30:20] <gour_> evening...just a short question - how is notmuch suitable for evil-mode or better to stay with plain emacs bindings?
[00:30:42] <gour_> as an ex vim user i still haven't decided on evil-mode...
[00:31:07] <bremner> I know at least one spacemacs user uses it, dunno what spacemacs does with the keybindings
[00:31:50] <bremner> without any modification, notmuch-emacs bindings probably clash with evil-mode movement e.g.
[00:32:22] <bremner> It's like dired; notmuch uses many unmodified letters
[00:33:01] <gour_> bremner: thank you for your input. ðŸ˜‰
[00:34:25] <inwit> bremner, for the record: my trouble with the post-new hook running always or not was related to the mere definition of the "hook" concept: I guess, by definition, a hook always run when the "parent" function is run. I take my proposed patch doesn't make the docs worse, but I understood this today walking through a forest and I thought I'd shared it. :)
[00:35:31] <inwit> gour: I use spacemacs. And have a strong opinion on the matter, but I can't write it down now. I'll try tomorrow.
[00:36:10] <gour_> inwit: ok, i'll join tomorrow

[10:06:44] <seanw> bremner: making some nmbug debugging progress.  I have discovered that if more than one nmbug process is running then they all try to use the same path to save and read nmbug.index.
[10:06:53] <seanw> this does not seem good.
[10:08:11] <seanw> seems like you could just use a temporary file.  I'll try hacking that in

[14:27:59] <inwit> Morning, gour, here's my take on evil+notmuch. In spacemacs (develop branch), there's an unmantained and old notmuch layer, which has some decisions that could be improved. It seems not many people are using it at the moment. I really like evil but I'm thus considering disabling it in notmuch buffers. I think it might be fairly easy to have a proper evilified notmuch that works fine for us, since the collisions are not that much and I believe the
[14:29:56] <inwit> See also this recent thread: https://nmbug.notmuchmail.org/nmweb/show/CHN3RP2YOZ39.129PCKUPWN572%40bisio
[15:10:36] <gour> inwit: ping
[15:11:44] <gour> inwit: why you're using spacemacs over e.g. doom which seems to have better support?
[15:12:17] <gour> i tried spacemacs in the past, but last time idi check, it was till deb-branch only and tons of unresolved issued
[15:22:28] <inwit> gour: I started with spacemacs by pure chance and I stayed. I'm playing with the idea of building my own config, but I think I need more elisp mental muscle for that. Maybe I should try doom, yes.
[15:29:10] <gour> inwit: i see...i'm still trying with my own config...recently switched to straight.el...btw do you have some notmuch config usign multiple accounts to share? i really like notmuch, but still use mu4e where it's easier/simpler do define different contexts, but, otoh, struggle with it since it's more folder than tag-based. i'd also liek to deploy afew+muchsync to sync ms db with the old netbook i have to use sometimes...
[15:30:29] <gour> *to define
[15:34:55] <inwit> No, sorry, no multiple account on my side. I haven't wrapped my head around mixing different accounts into the same notmuch database. I use notmuch for my work-related mail account, and aerc for the rest.
[15:37:11] <inwit> I'll have a look into notmuch in doom. Although I'm afraid of doom being a rabbit hole and ending up using more time than it would save. Maybe save it for holidays... :)
[15:37:46] <gour> aerc also uses notmuch?
[15:38:22] <inwit>  It can, yes, but I use the IMAP backend there.
[16:00:21] <inwit> gour, for evil there's also this: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection/blob/master/modes/notmuch/evil-collection-notmuch.el
[16:05:06] <inwit> I guess I'll end up wiring my own evil bindings for notmuch, cause I see how the defaults are good but I couldn't survive without hjkl movements.
[16:07:51] <bremner> seanw: uh, yeah sounds reasonable. I (obviously) never thought about concurrent (or even non-interactive) nmbug
[16:07:54] <bremner> seanw: btw there
[16:08:04] <bremner> is a potential speed optimization using lastmod that I have been meaning to look at for some large number of years...
[16:34:55] <gour> inwit: thank you for the url
[16:54:38] <inwit> gour: you're welcome. If you get any further with evil bindings, please let me know.
