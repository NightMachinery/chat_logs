[01:49:45] <Croran> I just feel like it would be of far more practical value if the parent directory's mtime were related to the mtime of the files within.
[01:49:56] <Croran> so that's why i wonder if there's a file system mode that does that.
[01:50:00] <LeoNerd> Perhaps. but that isn't how any UNIX system has ever worked for the past 40 or so years
[01:50:12] <LeoNerd> That would make file modifications more expensive, as now it has to update all its parents
[01:50:20] <LeoNerd> (yes, "all", because it could be multilinked)
[01:51:17] <LeoNerd> Would you do it recursively, all the way down? Would the mtime of the root dir be changing -all- the time?
[01:54:19] <Croran> LeoNerd: well assuming the subdirectories complied already, you would only need to do it recursively to directories
[01:54:49] <Croran> leonerd: isn't the mtime of the root dir changing all the time anyway?
[01:54:54] <LeoNerd> No?

[02:00:07] <Croran> anyway it seems to me like there are tricks that could make the overhead trivial
[02:02:10] <Croran> since only the latest file time is relevant, flag any files that are currently the latest in any given directory tree and then compare against those any time a change is made.
[02:03:55] <Croran> then you only have to 'really' recalculate when one of those flagged files changes.
[02:05:21] <Croran> or i guess, when one of those flagged files is deleted or moved to a different directory structure. since any other change would make it still the latest.

[07:56:48] <mst> having gone through high school as a nerd with the surname Trout, I (a) don't take myself seriously at all (b) really enjoyed a truly evil joke on my name that for once -wasn't- based on the surname :D

[08:00:28] <mst> after a conference in denmark a lot of years ago
[08:00:41] <mst> naturally a bunch of us piled down the pub after the last day of the conference
[08:01:09] <mst> me, plus and awesome group of scandiwegian mostly sysadmins, plus two outliers
[08:01:21] <mst> (1) a dude who was a sysadmin but also kind of a muppet
[08:01:49] <mst> (2) a french student who was doing a year at the hosting university who was actually quite smart but also clearly very overfaced by the people he was drinking with
[08:02:26] <mst> so when (I hadn't bothered taking my badge off) the muppet basically went "ha ha you're a fish" at me in the middle of an otherwise individual technical conversation
[08:02:44] <mst> s/individual/interesting/ # it's 0432 here, I suck
[08:03:17] <mst> I said "sure, but that's the *shit* joke you can make based on my badge, there's actually a good one"
[08:03:22] <mst> and everybody looked confused
[08:03:35] <Croran> haha
[08:03:39] <mst> and then I pointed at the smart french kid and said "he'll know"
[08:03:51] <mst> and he looked for a few seconds and then collapsed laughing
[08:04:08] <Croran> nice
[08:04:22] <mst> I let him explain the joke to the assembled drinkers
[08:04:33] <mst> the muppet looked like he was sucking on a lemon
[08:04:50] <Croran> part muppet, part sysadmin.
[08:04:53] <mst> and the smart french kid loved being the centre of attention and getting to get everybody else to laugh their arses off
[08:05:16] <Croran> sounds like fun
[08:05:20] <mst> and *that* got him to stop feeling overfaced and properly join the conversation
[08:05:28] <Croran> when was that?
[08:05:30] <mst> also the muppet basically shut up after that

[08:25:35] <Croran> at a fundamental level though. there is a disconnect between the motivations and thought processes of a child, an adolescent, and adult

[17:06:30] <LeoNerd> Not putting `use strict`, and it's a terible idea. don't do it
[17:06:40] <haarg> you probably want the #raku channel

[17:22:25] <aquanight> well I don't know about raku but for perl you can either 'no strict' or you can put an explicit package name.

[23:54:00] <Grinnz> yes, you need to call methods on $self
[23:54:21] <Grinnz> this is important for inheritance to work
[23:55:52] <Mandevil> Is it like that in Corinna as well?
[23:56:36] <Grinnz> yes
[23:57:00] <Grinnz> inheritance is a fundamental property of object orientation, you will not find an actual OO system that doesn't require this
[23:57:21] <Mandevil> Oh right, you need to use this in JavaScript at al.
