[00:27:04] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @golanv what command/key-binding do you use to start the search?
[00:27:26] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> some commands just search backward, so directional keys seem to work opposite
[00:28:38] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> oppositely
[00:33:01] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> @lebensterben: Forward slash.  "k" does seem search backwards for some reason.  Is there a better way to initiate search other than "/"?
[00:36:17] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> / should be searching forward. shift-3 is backward if I remember correctly
[00:36:23] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Weirdly...if I use the "Shift + *" key, search works normally.
[00:36:36] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> what you described seems like a bug
[00:36:53] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> have you also enabled our keyboard-layout layer?
[00:37:33] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I haven't looked at your package but it may conflict with other packages
[00:37:53] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> It does seem to be a bug.  I'm not sure if it's in spacemacs or emacs-evil-colemak-basics.  I don't see anything obviously wrong in evil-colemak-basics.el
[00:38:56] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Previously, but that is disabled now.  I should take a deeper look at my .spacemacs file to make sure I didn't overlook anything.
[00:42:49] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if there's no such bug report there, it might be on our side
[00:43:44] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> their readme clearly says n -> k
[00:53:41] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Yeah..."/" causes the correct word to be highlighted, but "k" (n) cycles through the keyword from the previous search result.  The spacemacs keyboad-layout layer has been disabled (I did try colemak-hnei).  I guess I'll open a bug report for spacemacs.  Maybe another colemak user can confirm the behavior
[00:54:05] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> @lebensterben: Thanks for your help!
[02:12:45] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> That is what the `dotspacemacs/user-config`. Although you can also set variables using the `:variables` in the layer declaration
[02:13:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> That's nice, I think Emacs 29 does not bring much news yet... or does it?
[02:19:32] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> neovim has very good support for lsp and treesitter. I think that's really a competitive edge over vanilla emacs.
[02:20:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Emacs really need to catch up those new inventions
[02:26:47] <FromGitter> <westrom:matrix.org> The only real nice thing, is that because I'm on a multi-dpi setup, the sway compositor works very well. When I move emacs from one monitor to another, emacs 29 will re-render to display at the proper dpi, where as emacs 28 will be stuck at the smallest dpi.

[04:55:44] <Unicorn_Princess> how can i display the buffer text encoding (like utf-8, utf-16, is-8895.. not just the line-ending style) in the powerline? the spaceline-toggle-buffer-encoding-abbrev-on/off functions successfully show/hide the 'unix' line end indicator, but the spaceline-toggle-buffer-encoding-on/off functions (without the abbrev) seem to have no effect
[04:57:41] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> could be a bug. I'm not sure since I don't use spaceline.
[05:03:34] <Unicorn_Princess> how can I find out the encoding of a file, then? if I don't care about displaying it in the modeline
[05:05:47] <Unicorn_Princess> there's a describe-current-coding-system function, but i'm not sure how to interpret the output
[05:11:23] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Coding-Systems.html
[05:12:50] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> try to open it in web browser . I think some browsers can open txt files. then you can change the encoding there
[05:13:12] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> wrong encoding usually results in unreadable text
[05:16:47] <Unicorn_Princess> if i understand that right, describe-coding-system is what tells me what the current buffer is coded as. the 1st 2 lines of its output for my .spacemacs are: "Coding system for saving this buffer:  - -- undecided-unix (alias: unix)"
[05:17:11] <Unicorn_Princess> which.. doesn't actually tell me a coding system. only line ending stle
[05:17:13] <Unicorn_Princess> style*
[06:07:34] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> the coding system is undecided ...
[06:08:09] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it should be something like iso-latin-1-unix at least
[06:08:41] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> the last part is the line ending and previous parts are the "encoding" per se
[06:09:25] <Unicorn_Princess> you get usable results from describe-current-coding-system?
[06:25:38] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> nope
[06:26:00] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I'm resting in bed. iso-latin-1-unix is just an example from the manual
[06:26:43] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I suggest to open it in browser to check its encoding
[06:29:01] <Unicorn_Princess> i have lots of ways to check encodings already, notably vscodium. but i'm trying to move to using emacs exclusively
[07:02:39] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I don't think that a good idea. I often use vim to fix Emacs for example... You need a backup tool
[07:08:44] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> And as I always say, nothing is difficult as long as you give up.
[07:09:03] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Just give up when you find something is fighting you in every way possible...
[07:12:53] <Unicorn_Princess> if i did that i'd be dead already
