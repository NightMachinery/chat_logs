[18:07:03] <lizmat> so don't do that in scripts  :-)

[19:06:49] <Xliff> An educational opportunity has rolled up on my desk. I'd like to submit a lesson plan centered around Raku. I then might be offered the opportunity to teach the class.
[19:09:28] <moritz> Nomokosch: no left recursion in grammars, no
[19:09:51] <moritz> Xliff: https://perl6book.com/ has lots of resources, for one
[19:10:13] <Xliff> Wasn't there a lesson plan for Raku?
[19:10:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> tldr it seems like the grammar of Rust has left recursion in it and someone tried to parse it not so long ago
[19:10:14] <moritz> https://andrewshitov.com/2021/01/13/the-course-of-raku/
[19:11:05] <Xliff> moritz++
[19:11:13] <moritz> I don't think left-recursion is part of a language, just of a grammar. You can always come up with a grammar for the same language that's not left recursive
[19:11:13] *** Joins: razetime (~quassel@117.254.34.2)
[19:11:27] <moritz> in fact, there are parser generators that do that automatically (possibly bison?)
[19:12:53] <moritz> ("always" is to be used with caution here; I think the theoretical proof applies to context-free grammars)
[19:16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the question is, at what cost?
[19:17:56] <moritz> with a bit of experience it's usually not too bad
[19:18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > for example, we descend from <expression> into <expression-without-block>, into <operator-expression>,  into <comparison-expression>, but then back up into <expression>
[19:20:38] <moritz> there are lots of examples out there on how to structure an expression grammar that it doesn't run into left recursion
[19:21:07] * [Coke] wonders when moritz got famous. :)
[19:21:16] <[Coke]> also: hey, dude.
[19:22:56] <moritz> [Coke]: i wondered that as well :-) Hi there
[19:24:05] <moritz> In fact I'm pretty sure that both the parsing book and my general raku book contain examples for mathemtical expressions that avoid this left recursion pitfall

[19:26:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well it's not my problem, thank God, so I'm perfectly satisfied with knowing that there are established solutions 😛

[20:47:20] <rir> Fiveish thinking:  [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep( .elems >= 2);   How do I make a smartmatch work?  Or am I missing a callable?
[20:53:21] <CIAvash> rir: `.grep(*.elems >= 2)` or `.grep({ .elems >= 2 })` or `.grep: * ≥ 2`
[20:56:12] *** Quits: razetime (~quassel@117.254.34.2) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:09:48] <rir> CIAvash, thanks for setting right.   I was surprised then followed the no 'Bool as Matcher' in the wrong direction.
[21:16:10] <lizmat> most newbies initially think of "*.elems" as some magic, without realizing it is actually just syntax to create a Callable
[21:19:08] <tonyo> m: [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep({@$_ >= 2})
[21:19:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 377564339: ( no output )
[21:19:13] <tonyo> m:  dd [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep({@$_ >= 2})
[21:19:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 377564339: OUTPUT: «($(1, 2),).Seq␤»
[21:19:46] <tonyo> star also just works
[21:19:52] <tonyo> m: dd [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep(* >= 2);
[21:19:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 377564339: OUTPUT: «($(1, 2),).Seq␤»
[21:21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this reminds me...
[21:21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is the difference between .cache and .List?
[21:24:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> more specifically... it seems to me that .cache doesn't fetch the whole list

[21:42:17] <rir> lizmat, that is because it is weird and found in other items' doc before one knows it exists.  That invites copying w/o much  comprehension when 'getting it done' overwhelms curiosity.  Then that zero/tiny comprehension is validated...
