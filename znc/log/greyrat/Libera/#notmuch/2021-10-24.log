[04:40:44] <jrm> I'm working on updating the notmuch FreeBSD package to 0.34, but running into a problem getting ./configure to recognize libsfsexp, which is installed under /usr/local.  ./configure reports "Checking for sfsexp... No (will not enable s-expression queries)."  Am I missing a configure arg or a environment variable?
[04:43:15] *** Quits: nyah (~nyah@bcdcb6e3.skybroadband.com) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[04:44:27] <jrm> ...*an* environment variable
[04:46:13] <jrm> The problem is that pkg-config --exists sfsexp
[04:46:14] <bremner> jrm: it uses pkg-config to check
[04:46:28] <jrm> :) yeah.  That's failing for some reason.
[04:47:17] <jrm> I just created the sfsexp port/package.  I probably did something wrong there.
[04:48:22] <bremner> I guess there's a fixed set of places that pkg-config looks. I don't know where those are on FreeBSD
[04:50:34] <bremner> do other pkg-config things in /usr/local work?
[04:51:04] <jrm> I'm pretty sure that's a yes, but I have to dig a bit.  It's been some time since I've messed with pkg-config.
[04:52:37] <bremner> thanks for packaging sfsexp, I know it's a bit of drag to have new dependencies
[04:52:48] <bremner> 0.34  will build without it.
[04:54:57] <jrm> It is building/running fine without it.  It's just 'notmuch config get built_with.sexpr_queries' is reporting false and I thought I would give it a shot getting that working.
[05:01:20] <jrm> I don't see any sfsexp.pc file under ${PREFIX}/libdata/pkgconfig, whereas most other packages that use pkg-config seems to have something there.
[05:01:31] <jrm> *seem*
[05:02:41] <jrm> But I see you worked on this.  https://github.com/mjsottile/sfsexp/commit/a3f2ca2bf41625162328a5d22bf558afb439b3af
[05:02:55] <bremner> yes, in debian it gets installed in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/sfsexp.pc
[05:03:16] <bremner> I think there is .pc.in file that gets run through sed or something
[05:05:14] <bremner> right. so maybe you just need to install the generated .pc file?
[05:06:30] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@201.182.226.118)
[05:09:40] <jrm> sfsexp.pc.in doesn't exist in the tarball that I'm downloading.  mjsottile-sfsexp-v1.3.1_GH0.tar.gz) = db0674b9bafbfeadc03baac2790a12055212e6ba2a1a67a3674ada7cff155107
[05:10:40] <jrm> It looks like it was only added after the release of v1.3.1.
[05:18:52] <bremner> ah, yeah, that's unfortunate
[05:19:46] <bremner> maybe ask sottile to tag a release? he seams fairly responsive

[05:25:54] <bremner> I have to crash now, but if needed I can file an issue tommorow
[05:33:07] <jrm> G'night and thanks.  A new release is not an issue.  The way things are set up, I can easily pull later code.
[05:39:57] <jrm> Manually installing a patched sfsexp.pc seems to work.  notmuch configure now says "Checking for sfsexp... Yes." and ldd /usr/local/bin/notmuch | grep sexp says libsexp.so.1 => /usr/local/lib/libsexp.so.1 (0x800b2d000).  But, notmuch config get built_with.sexpr_queries still reports 'false'.
[05:42:05] <jrm> Huh.. just ran notmuch config get built_with.sexpr_query again and it says true??
[05:43:07] <jrm> Ah, the NEWS says to run 'notmuch config get built_with.sexpr_queries' and that reports false, but I think it should be 'notmuch config get built_with.sexpr_queries' which reports true.
[05:43:45] <jrm> bah.. the second command should have said 'notmuch config get built_with.sexpr_query'.  *That* reports true.

[18:06:07] <Ebrahim[m]> I can't understand why my sent emails are not stored. Is it becasue `notmuch-fcc-dirs` is set to nil in DOOM by default? https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/modules/email/notmuch/config.el#L54
[18:06:59] <bremner> Ebrahim[m]: probably. But I don't use doom-emacs so I can't say for sure.
[18:07:36] <bremner> Ebrahim[m]: do the get saved in vanilla emacs?
[18:08:18] <bremner> better yet, test in emacs -q and set the minimum config you need to run notmuch. There is a script to do this in the notmuch source
[18:10:46] <Ebrahim[m]> bremner: I'd tried to set it back to `sent` by
[18:10:46] <Ebrahim[m]> (setq notmuch-fcc-dirs "sent")
[18:10:46] <Ebrahim[m]> but somehow the variable still is set to nil.
[18:11:16] <bremner> if the problem only happens in doom-emacs then you know who to blame
[18:13:19] <Ebrahim[m]> The thing is I can't figure out if they're not stored or stored in a wrong directory :(
[18:14:02] <bremner> nil should not store anything
[18:21:12] <Ebrahim[m]> Oh it needed to be wrapped in a (!after notmuch ...). Now the fcc-dirs is set to `sent` and I get a extra line of `Fcc: sent` in message-mode.
[18:21:22] <Ebrahim[m]> But still nothing is being saved
[18:22:13] <bremner> what is the value of notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert
[18:22:18] <Ebrahim[m]> And by saved, I mean listed in `is:sent` search.
[18:22:56] <bremner> well, that's not automatic. See the docstring for notmuch-fcc-dirs
[18:23:09] <bremner> and you need the second variable I mentioned.
[18:23:12] <Ebrahim[m]> bremner: t
[18:24:00] <bremner> I'd first look for the message by e.g. subject and then fix up the tagging
[18:26:50] <bremner> you probably want something like "sent +sent -unread"
[18:29:56] <Ebrahim[m]> Fixed. nice!
[18:33:06] <Ebrahim[m]> Sorry to constantly spamming but can I ask how did you achieve "delete after read" thing in offlineimap you mentioned earlier? I tried to do that in isync and couldn't find a relative configuration for that.
[18:35:54] <bremner> personally I haven't use offlineimap for years, but maybe somebody else can help
[18:38:05] <Ebrahim[m]> Oh I must've confused `getmail` with `offilineimap`.
[18:38:28] <bookworm> simply move the messags out of the maildir folder, that will mark them as deleted. So you generally want to make a maidlir store, sync that with the remote, then immediately move all messages to some other store, not synced with the actual remote (say gmail or whatever)
[18:38:34] <bookworm> then point notmuch at that second store
[18:39:03] <bremner> that sounds like offlineimap ?
[18:39:10] <bookworm> and tell mbsync to delete + expunge
[18:39:20] <bremner> oh.
[18:40:19] <bremner> with getmail it's just "[options]\ndelete=1" in the config file.
[18:40:28] <bremner> but of course that's not doing any syncing.
[18:45:02] <Ebrahim[m]> I'm using NixOS's home-manager for email-related configuration so I think it's easy to switch from mbsync to getmail.
[18:46:17] <Ebrahim[m]> Oh it even has it here.
[18:46:17] <Ebrahim[m]> https://rycee.gitlab.io/home-manager/options.html#opt-accounts.email.accounts._name_.getmail.delete
[19:25:20] <jrm> bremner: I submitted a patch, but just got a 'Warning: could not send message for past 4 hours' from git send-email --to notmuch@notmuchmail.org origin/master.  I assume someone can figure that one out without a patch. :)

[22:37:39] <jrm> The problem is almost certainly on my end.  It's been years since I submitted a patch with 'git send-mail', so it was probably trying to go out directly on port 25, which Bell certainly blocks.
