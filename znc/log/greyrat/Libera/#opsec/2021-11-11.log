[04:41:24] <Roey> o/ Joanna 
[04:41:45] <Roey> didn't see anything out of the ordinary :) folks here need to start making noise! :) :)
[04:44:20] <Joanna> A lot of channels seem quiet except #programming
[04:45:43] <Joanna> Did anyone else have slow internet today?

[04:55:40] <jan6> people make lots of NOISE here already, Roey, namely, join-leave noise
[04:56:08] <jan6> (lookin' at you, plankst€r)
[04:56:19] <Joanna> And changing hosts..
[04:57:43] <Joanna> I once got in trouble with thumbs for my client joining and parting too much. Anyone here know thumbs ?
[04:57:44] <Roey> hee hee hee
[04:57:55] <Roey> oh I don't know thumbs
[04:57:58] <jan6> plankster's doing like half the join-leave noise, and timeouting... no "changing hosts" I can see in here, everyone who leaves stays off for some seconds at least
[04:58:14] <plankster> sorry my vpn sucks
[04:58:32] <jessicara> irccloud is going a bit wonky
[04:58:46] <jessicara> night
[04:59:08] <Joanna> I could hardly join irc today it was just connecting...
[04:59:20] <Joanna> jessicara: any ideas why?
[04:59:33] <jessicara> unforunately no
[04:59:46] <jessicara> i hear irccloud has been having ipv6 issues for a while
[04:59:59] <jessicara> and a lot of the connections from irccloud to libera are ipv6
[05:00:24] <Joanna> Oh I don’t know the details it’s just magic:)
[05:00:30] <jessicara> my own connection is a disaster too though
[05:00:35] *** Quits: aizen (sid462968@ilkley.irccloud.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:01:20] * jessicara actually leaves for bed now, night
[05:01:21] <jan6> it's not too bad yet, plankster, there's plenty of other people quitting and stuff too, you're just the main join-leaver I notice, heh, (of course, there's always option to run a bouncer or relay or something, too)
[05:01:24] *** Joins: aizen (sid462968@ilkley.irccloud.com)
[05:01:29] <jan6> it's 03:31 here
[05:01:31] <jan6> ....again
[05:01:37] <jan6> frick me and my sense of time
[05:01:37] <Joanna> Aren’t other chat programs like discord slower Ethan irc if you have slow internet?
[05:01:57] <jan6> what is that sentence you just spoke
[05:02:21] *** Quits: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[05:02:32] <Joanna> Me ?
[05:02:36] <jan6> yes
[05:02:46] <jan6> "03:31 <Joanna> Aren’t other chat programs like discord slower Ethan irc if you have slow internet?"
[05:03:24] <jan6> even if it was autocorrect, I can't make sense of "discord slower Ethan irc"
[05:03:43] <jan6> although in general, irc is bare minimum data usage out of anything
[05:03:56] <Joanna> Slower than irc. I don’t know where Ethan came from. I finish a word and it decides to correct it !
[05:04:41] <jan6> you literally send like <5 lines of data to initiate your connection, and then pretty much only communicate the exact text shown on screen, after you've connected
[05:05:04] <Joanna> Best to use fuzzy logic when you see strange words :)
[05:07:05] <jan6> but I mean, IRC is well-known to be super low bandwidth, the fact it was made in ~1988 already tells you that
[05:07:30] <Joanna> Does anyone know how to tell if an irc member is a bot ?
[05:07:41] <jan6> ask a question? ;P
[05:08:23] <Joanna> Besides the known bots that recite web link details
[05:09:19] <jan6> if it's not a known bot, and the nick doesn't reply anything after asking a question from them at different times throughout the day, it'd be pretty safe to kick them
[05:09:44] *** Joins: pyfisch (~pyfisch@user/pyfisch)
[05:09:48] <jan6> and when they rejoin, ask it again, and if still no answer in like...idk, half an hour, then I guess a ban might be alright?
[05:10:12] <jan6> ^ would be my strategy
[05:10:55] <jan6> although you never know if someone's a lurker-person, bot, or just someone who forgot they're even in this channel, just by looking
[05:12:35] <Hydragyrum> CTCP VERSION queries can tell you a good bit too
[05:12:53] <jan6> sometimes you can assume stuff based on the /whois info (nick, username, "realname", IP/hostname, etc), but that'd a verrry shaky ground, and won't get you far
[05:12:56] <jan6> hm, yeah
[05:13:13] <jan6> my VERSION is the best version
[05:13:17] <jan6> ctcp me to see ;P
[05:13:23] <Hydragyrum> weechat 0.3.0
[05:13:34] <Hydragyrum> from 2009...
[05:13:38] <jan6> ;P
[05:13:56] <Hydragyrum> bots will usually not reply or give a reply that makes sense as a bot
[05:14:00] <jan6> a lot of clients offer options to set custom ctcp replies, or block them altogether
[05:14:36] <jan6> and if the maker bothered to spend like 15 more minutes, adding ctcp support is pretty dang easy
[05:14:42] <Hydragyrum> yes
[05:14:59] <Hydragyrum> but most bots with ctcp support show bot version or the like
[05:15:16] <Hydragyrum> it's likely better than whois for telling bots from people though
[05:15:19] <jan6> yeah, because they're ran by idiots
[05:15:24] <jan6> also yeah
[05:15:58] <Atque> jan6: Maybe, they have have autojoin, a job and a dodgy internet connection. Spotting bots is hard.
[05:16:08] <jan6> yep
[05:16:38] <jan6> that's why the first step is pinging a question multiple times a day
[05:16:54] <jan6> although even then, "maybe they don't check IRC every single day"
[05:16:57] <jan6> etc
[05:17:12] <Joanna> Making people talk to be part of channel is most foolproof way but I think our channel would be rather small if I enforced such a policy:)
[05:17:37] <jan6> if you really don't like lurker-bots, you just have to draw a line SOMEWHERE
[05:18:03] <Joanna> Lurker bots make channel look good :)
[05:18:19] <jan6> normal bots also relatively often reply to "botname: help" or such
[05:18:21] * Roey rejoices at all the channel noise he's now seeing \o/
[05:18:24] <jan6> at least good bots ;P
[05:18:27] <jan6> all hail jan6
[05:18:30] * jan6 slep
[05:18:31] <Atque> jan6: You'd probably to kick people periodically and do some kind of automated check, like a google capture. People do that, but it's annoying as.
[05:18:34] <Roey> \jan6/
[05:18:37] <jan6> it's friggen LATE AF o'clock
[05:18:53] <Joanna> I just was pondering how some channels have hundreds of members and 5 people who talk
[05:19:39] <jan6> lotsa lurkers
[05:19:49] <Atque> I imagine the opers do something to cut down silly bots too. Mind, on Efnet, it's pretty crazy with bots.
[05:19:51] <Joanna> Oh there is one thing I’ve heard if that will make inactive people not see any text I think it’s called bandwidth saver or something
[05:20:02] <jan6> silent majority
[05:20:23] <jan6> bandwidth saver on mobile? that might prevent BACKGROUND apps, I thnk
[05:20:56] <Joanna> There is no way to differentiate between people who are real that are afk and nicks that have never talked
[05:20:59] <jan6> if you did something else and had an irc client on mobile, with data saver, then fair enough if it blocks that, or makes it super slow bandwidth
[05:21:20] <jan6> there is with "never talked", it's called logs ;P
[05:21:25] <Atque> jan6: Directly connecting to IRC from phones is unideal I think. IRC requires a persistent TCP connection. Any breaks and you disconnect and annoy people.
[05:21:30] <jan6> definitely
[05:21:44] <jan6> hence me connecting from a stable shell host server ;P
[05:21:52] <Atque> yup
[05:22:34] <Joanna> Irc cloud saves everything that happened on their servers and gives it back when app has focus again
[05:22:50] <jan6> all bouncers do that too
[05:23:46] <Joanna> I don’t want to become one of those people always online who never talk....
[05:23:48] <jan6> you just need somewhere to keep the bouncer connected from, but there's toooons of znc and bnc hosts, and literally any stable shell host would work
[05:23:49] <Atque> otfc is a good solution if you're worried about spies etc.
[05:24:08] <Atque> off the record.... whatever the acronym is.
[05:24:13] <jan6> "Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate"
[05:24:14] <jan6> ;P
[05:24:22] <jan6> OTR is off-the-record
[05:24:28] <jan6> OTP is one-time-pad
[05:24:43] <Atque> Haha... yeah, I am terrible with acronyms.
[05:24:43] <jan6> OMEMO is preferred over OTR, at least on xmpp, these days
[05:24:50] <Joanna> There are most definitely spy bots recording all irc data for who knows why
[05:25:10] <jan6> ah OMEMO is a XMPP-only thing
[05:25:19] <jan6> I'm one of the spy bots!
[05:25:21] <jan6> ;P
[05:25:40] <jan6> like honestly, logging all chats is the default, on irc
[05:25:50] <Joanna> You have blown your cover!
[05:26:15] <jan6> if you want to NOT be logged, you gotta make sure to trust everyone you talk to, and chat it a private room only
[05:26:38] <jan6> (or at least use the honor system, and put it in front of the topic)
[05:26:49] <Joanna> If I was going to have a bot free channel I’d probably make a smaller secret channel for people who talk
[05:27:13] <jan6> invite-only channel with invite-exclusions for regulars, could be nice
[05:27:48] <Joanna> I used to have an unregistered secret channel it was easier that way
[05:28:02] <jan6> you can use most chanmodes anyway
[05:28:14] <jan6> so doesn't matter, other than losing op
[05:29:09] <Joanna> Every time the channel got too active one of the members would turn into a troll and we would have to move to a new channel it seemed. I think my sources of members was not so good back then

[05:30:57] <jan6> that was a special kind of crazy

[05:31:11] <jan6> also it's 04 at night

[05:31:37] <Joanna> That is definitely a bunch of crazy people did you ever know genr8 or crystalmath?
[05:32:23] <Joanna> Oh wait that was #information channel. Same genre
[05:32:57] <jan6> nah, I forget who ran it, but I think it was like, I met someone, invited to my channel, and in return they invited me to their channel, which turned out to be ##truth, lol
[05:33:22] <Joanna> Truth is on rizon and it’s horrible channel lol
[05:33:41] <jan6> yeah, it was horrible enough to get banned from freenode, from what I've heard
[05:33:42] <jan6> lol
[05:34:01] <Joanna> It’s closed here
[05:34:09] <Joanna> I just tried to join it ..

[05:34:43] <Joanna> I remember when ##conspiracy was closed on freenode. Good riddance
[05:36:00] <Joanna> Those types of channels just get filled with trolls and the owners are complicit. I don’t know what their purpose is besides making sure the topic isn’t discussed.

[05:37:32] <Joanna> I want to be entertained when I go to a channel like that.
[05:42:36] <Atque> I wonder if anyone chats on freenode still.
[05:43:13] <Atque> I was there briefly after the Chosen Empire invaded, but left when they start requiring SASL and prevent /nick changes ><
[05:45:15] <Joanna> Atque: I know someone who is stuck on joseon.kr and refuses to leave. There is some chatting in the main channel there but it’s definitely not about foss projects anymore
[05:45:47] <Joanna> He is the proud owner of many dead channels..
[05:46:57] <Atque> Joanna: Maybe, he's after a knighthood
[05:49:07] <Joanna> There are other people that never made it to libera either and get angry when I tell them to come to Libera. And another person who I used to talk to everyday in irc for years who can’t seem to come to Libera and finally I helped him get registered after summoning the staff and he can’t seem to get around to downloading a new irc client so he can’t come to the registered only channels.
[05:49:50] <Joanna> It’s really strange how people have so much difficulty changing networks when we were even warned in advance that freenode was in trouble.
[05:51:05] <Atque> Yeah, it changed the vibe for me a bit tbh
[05:51:27] <Atque> Used to know a lot of people on the network. Now, still do to some extent, but people are kind of less engaged.
[05:51:32] <Joanna> Atque: I think the one stuck on joseon.kr is just somewhat crazy and has lost interest in programming.
[05:52:14] <Joanna> Yea it seems like some channels like security all the ops on freenode came here but are inactive
[05:52:58] <Joanna> To be honest. I think there is a concerted effort to get people off irc and onto other platforms.
[05:52:59] <Atque> Yeah, some core IT channels, like networking, docker, python etc. are busy still.
[05:53:15] <Atque> Lots of old active ones are now very head... like ##hardware
[05:53:17] <Joanna> Postgre is thriving also
[05:53:36] <Hydragyrum> well it's now #hardware not ##hardware
[05:53:56] <Atque> Yup, just release that... sorry
[05:54:13] <Joanna> It depends upon channel owners if they don’t manage channel correctly it will be destroyed by trolls who chase everyone away
[05:54:14] <Atque> Joanna: Haha, well, it's the world most popular sql database right now, isn't it?
[05:54:30] <Atque> Yeah, definitely
[05:54:35] <Joanna> Not sure I only use sqlite at moment..
[05:54:54] <Atque> And it's balancing act too tbh... sometimes ops kill all the talk by being too strict strict.
[05:55:23] <Atque> There's not many personalities who keep somewhere in the middle healthily I think.
[05:55:33] <Joanna> Or ops just get jaded after too many trolls and just start treating everyone like a troll
[05:55:48] <Atque> Yeah, I use sqlite3 all the time... python and in R mostly.
[05:56:15] <Atque> Main big databases I use at work now are cosmosdb I guess.
[05:56:37] <Atque> And M$ sql server 2019 for stuff that's still on prem
[05:56:45] <Joanna> Only allowing registered users into a channel cuts down on the trolls quite a lot . Anyone who has been to #libera can see the relentless onslaught of trolls.
[05:57:39] <Joanna> I have a set of firebird books and was planning on using that database but the community seems nonexistent
[05:58:29] <Atque> Yea, +R will stop casual trolls. If someone is being malicious because of some perceived slight, +R prob won't do much because registering nicks is very easy

[05:59:36] <Joanna> I don’t know if registering nicks can be automated I hope not
[06:00:34] <Joanna> I can’t stop trolls I can only make them get a new account
[06:01:28] <Joanna> Well if there was really a troll problem I would make a secret channel for the regulars to go to or ask for help from staff
[06:02:53] <Atque> Yeah, it can be.
[06:03:16] <Joanna> One thing I’ve learned about trolls that destroy channels is most people can’t seem to ignore the trolls or go make their own channel without the trolls they just give up on the channel.
[06:03:28] <Joanna> Or sufffer with the trolls...
[06:06:05] <Joanna> I once was in programming channel that had a professional troll that decided that nobody should be allowed to talk about the topic and everytime someone did he would attack and distract. And the only person who was active and opped was acting like the king in lord of the rings who was controlled by grimmar wormtongue. Anyone see that movie?
[06:27:08] <Joanna> Atque:
[06:27:28] <Atque> Joanna: o/
[06:29:42] <Roey> <Joanna> I just was pondering how some channels have hundreds of members and 5 people who talk <- what talking patterns do you see in this channel?
[06:30:02] <Roey> hey Atque o/
[06:30:23] <Atque> Hey Roey
[06:30:32] <Atque> Roey: How's things?
[06:30:38] <Roey> I take it by your nick that you're into operations work
[06:30:48] <Roey> Atque: hopefully interviewing this company Tuesday!

[06:30:59] <Roey> 8 years
[06:31:00] <Roey> edr
[06:31:01] <Roey> er
[06:31:04] <Roey> first new job in 18 years

[06:35:01] <Joanna> Roey: pretty much the same as other channels with most people always silent.
[06:35:24] <Joanna> Maybe a little more quiet because trolls aren’t allowed.

[06:41:16] <Roey> aye
[06:41:31] <Roey> Joanna: do you have a set of rules for the channel
[06:41:42] <Roey> so that you can hold people accountable 
[06:41:50] <Roey> like an AUP I suppose
[06:41:57] <Roey> AUP
[06:41:58] <Roey> AUP
[06:42:03] <Roey> AUP around ♪ 
[06:45:58] <Joanna> What is aup?
[06:46:25] <Roey> acceptable use policy
[06:46:40] <Roey> it's what you have ot sign with your employer when you onboard
[06:47:02] <Roey> stating that you recognize that all the shit  you do on your employer's systems is fucking monitored, yo o/
[06:47:15] <Roey> stuff like that.
[06:47:24] <Joanna> Oh that seems so formal
[06:47:47] <Roey> I'd still recommend it: you need something to be able to objectively hold people to
[06:48:05] <Roey> that way, they cannot argue with you
[06:48:09] <Roey> you're just following policy.
[06:48:24] <Joanna> If they misbehave they can’t talk here anymore unless they get a new account
[06:49:25] <Roey> Joanna: this is a nice professional channel and I like that.  I've seen nice general chat channels rise and fall hard when they turned into zoos of a couple hundred chatters
[06:49:40] <Joanna> I think it’s important to let people be themselves
[06:49:54] <Roey> I mean yes of course
[06:50:03] <Joanna> But if I don’t like what I see they can’t talk anymore
[06:50:13] <Roey> good
[06:50:34] <Joanna> I want high quality chat in here :)
