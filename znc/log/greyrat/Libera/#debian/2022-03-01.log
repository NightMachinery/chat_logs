[06:22:59] <jhutchins> somiaj: I would expect that if aplay sees the card, the rest of alsa _can_ see the card, and that the ball is dropped between the alsa layer and the GUI applet.
[06:24:19] <jhutchins> Since I can only use one output channel at a time, it's not functionally relevant, but it would be nice to have a few more output options like a decent eq.
[06:24:47] <jhutchins> I'm starting to mess with some audio applications again, and the sound is currently muddy (probably cheap speakers).
[06:25:22] <jhutchins> It could be the XFCE applet, XFCE doesn't always have all the bells and whistles.

[12:56:07] <xx> jelly: and if the first repo doesn't work, then the further repos are not consulted?
[12:56:20] <xx> kee: this is for the case where the local proxy goes down
[12:56:31] <kee> localhost is unlikely to go down.
[12:56:50] <kee> It depends whether it goes down before or after an `update`.
[12:56:59] <xx> basically the scenario is this: 1) Debian repos are extremely slow currently due to... political stuff 2) Local repo works but goes down due to interrupted connectivity to this local repo
[12:57:28] <kee> `apt update` will fetch the newest versions of packages. It doesn't know two things are meant to be the same (afaik), so if the first one's down, the second will have newer versions than the first.

[13:14:20] <Khepra> or it is apt-cacher and you're using only that, and the cacher in turn fetches from remote?
[13:15:28] <jelly> kee, very good point, but also, it's still offtopic
[13:16:03] <xx> Khepra: I'm in a situation where the a local mirror is created in one building, but internet access to that building drops out frequently depending on electricity being switched off or internet being down, and when that happens I'd like apt to just use the main debian repos
[13:16:23] <xx> but sometimes the main debian repos are inaccessible too, and even if they are then internet is currently throttled to them
[13:16:50] <Khepra> maybe you should solve it lower in the OSI stack. DNS based failover or ha-proxy, like that?
[13:17:20] <xx> Khepra: everything is crashy, and this is for people who are moving about to wherever they can get internet at the time or where they can find shelter
[13:17:37] <xx> internet really isn't working too well or reliably here
[13:17:45] <Khepra> with DNS you can resolve locally, and say return both deb.debian.org's upstream IP and your local IP, libc shoudl pick one automagically, at the price of increased latency
[13:18:09] <xx> basically it's people receiving laptops
[13:18:54] <Khepra> (well, maybe not deb.debian.org but a dedicated mirror, with stable IP addr)
[13:19:19] <xx> and I can't guarantee that anything I'd set up keeps being accessible through the internet, so as the last step everything should failover to debian repos
[13:20:09] <xx> I'll come up with something
[13:21:04] <Khepra> maybe the official .ua mirror can be used, and specifically configured with multiple redundant points

[19:29:13] <mmalter> It sounds silly to me but I might be out of touch
[19:29:52] <kee> mmalter: There are Debian packages in the Ubuntu repos.
[19:30:01] <jhutchins> mmalter: No, nnot true.
[19:30:07] <kee> I suppose technically, there are packages that are both Debian and Ubuntu, but I prefer to call them Debian packages.
[19:30:10] <Khepra> mmalter: ubuntu is based on debian. generally packages from debian end up in ubuntu, mostly modified. some may be shared between distros as many maintainers are maintainers in both distros.
[19:30:13] <jhutchins> mmalter: Some of the packages are the same.
[19:30:28] <Khepra> some of course originate in ubuntu and are introduced in debian.
[19:30:33] <Khepra> netplan.io, snapd, ...
[19:30:48] <kee> Khepra: Heathen. They originated in Debian first, and simply time-travelled to historical Ubuntu releases.
[19:30:52] <mmalter> Khepra: oh ok, I did not know that
[19:30:56] <kee> Except snapd. We can blame Ubuntu for that one.
[19:31:05] <Khepra> and netplan.io and apparmor and ....  :)
[19:31:16] <Khepra> pretty much any package for which ubuntu/canonical are upstream.
[19:31:19] <kee> AppArmor is good, therefore we invented it.
[19:31:42] <alkisg> Only I was amazed by the "my mom told me" part? :D Way to go, mom!
[19:31:57] <kee> It's only on the internet that parents are incompetent.
[19:31:57] <jhutchins> afik NONE of Debian is downstream from Ubuntu, it's all direct from upstream projects.
[19:32:10] <Khepra> alkisg: "Asking for a mom" :)
[19:32:15] <mmalter> Meh that was a bit of a troll question I'm sorry. It's just that she s quite knowledgable about foss in general but I felt it was a silly proposition.
[19:32:25] <kee> In the real-world, parents have pretty much the same distribution of competence as the general population, in most skills.
[19:32:50] <mmalter> kee: Worse, most parents have been children. Apparently
[19:33:07] <jhutchins> mmalter: It can be a confusing situation.  Ubuntu was originaly all Debian packages rebuilt for Ubuntu.
[19:33:28] <kee> If we're outliers in certain skills, our parents are likely to be less competent than us at those things. I think that's why we think parents are bad at stuff.
[19:33:37] <kee> mmalter: Okay, that one can't be true.

[19:39:41] <mmalter> kee: well that's the most sensible interpretation package ownership if that ever make sense
[19:39:47] <Khepra> and then there's the packages originating by canonical and ubuntu, ported to debian.

[19:40:55] <mmalter> kee: If the stuff has a Debian maintainer who's active, I'd call that a Debian package. Sometimes it's the guy who writes the code.

[21:40:10] <sney> It's pretty trivial to slap a debian logo on a html page with a link to the announcement or whatever. but I'm sure they had a bureaucratic reason for it. :P and now #debian can answer some of those repeat questions too
[21:40:11] <shtrb> hopefully salsa is handeled by more than one person
[21:40:25] <shtrb> btw the auth still works
[21:40:30] <kee> sney: For a certain kind of person, slapping a Debian logo on an HTML page isn't good enough.
[21:40:45] <kee> Nothing, then answering questions, is easier than putting together an *adequate* “it's down” page.

[21:41:31] <somiaj> there might be some announcment burried in some mailing list archive, since that seems to be where most of debian communication still is today
[21:41:55] <kee> Who even uses email any more?
[21:42:00] <kee> Far more people in the world use IRC than email.
[21:42:38] <sney> debian dev is still largely organized via email, with salsa itself as the slowly growing replacement
[21:43:11] <sney> I'm subscribed to d-d-a though and I didn't see anything about salsa downtime. guess I missed that oen
