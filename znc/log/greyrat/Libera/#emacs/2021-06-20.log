[00:52:45] <unyu> garjola: It is not so much that ERC does not work with libera.chat, as it is that using ERC with Freenode required no configuration besides supplying your nick(s) and password.
[00:53:38] <unyu> But that is because the default ERC configuration already contained useful stuff like how to authenticate with Freenode's NickServ.
[00:53:55] <garjola> unyu: I use ERC right now with the same config I used for freenode. Just changed the server, I think.

[01:25:37] <bpalmer> Wafficus: how are you trying to print it? you might be looking for message, print, or insert
[01:27:03] <bpalmer> (message "hello, world") shows it in the echo area ; (print "hello, world") can output in a bunch of ways and outputs its value in a format that can be later interpreted by (read) ; (insert "hello, world") just puts the text into the current buffer
[01:28:00] <Wafficus> just wanted to evaluate it in scratch buffer
[01:28:08] <Wafficus> then once I figure out what it prints out for my Fedora Server laptop
[01:28:21] <Wafficus> then I'll add it to my config for the use-package section for ERC
[01:28:30] <Wafficus> reason being, is that I didn't want IRC on my work laptop's Emacs setup
[01:28:45] <bpalmer> Wafficus: in *scratch*, just hit C-j  after typing (system-name)  . That will evaluate the form and insert the result.

[02:20:46] <MattByName> hey i'm a new emacs user and i'm just working on my config. I was just wondering, does use-package install packages and save them for later, or does it re-download them every time you start emacs? I'm sorry if it's a stupid question!
[02:21:57] <bpalmer> use-package in its most straightforward approach does neither; it helps you configure installed packages.
[02:22:05] <bpalmer> however you install them.
[02:22:47] <bpalmer> You can optionally integrate use-package with a system like straight, or (borg?), or package.el; these will normally speaking only download once
[02:22:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you use the :ensure keyword it'll normally try to use package.el to install things.
[02:22:57] <dale> MattByName: bpalmer is correct.  If you do configure use-package to actually install packages, all of the common ways of doing that will make use-package only download the package once and save it on your disk.
[02:23:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Borg and straight use slightly different commands for similar results.

[02:28:04] <dale> Just don't be like me and think "oh I'll use straight.el to install just this one package" except that one package happens to pull in every other popular package, so you end up moving 60% of your package.el packages to straight.
[02:28:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Wafficus: I tend to use use-package for my config and package.el for some ELPA packages. I otherwise maintain a git repo of submodules of packages I've check and I use the :load-path keyword to fetch them with use-package.

[02:29:44] <bpalmer> I don't like the idea of :ensure , myself; I prefer to be in full control of when and what packages are installed.

[02:30:20] <ahihi> i have this syntax entry for matching SuperCollider character literals (e.g. $a $1 $" ...): (modify-syntax-entry ?$ "/" table) . however the language also allows using an escape character after the dollar (e.g. $\a $\\ ...). how can i modify the syntax entry to account for this?
[02:30:23] <Wafficus> if its not on MELPA, I ain't interested
[02:30:31] <dminuoso> So I begin to wonder: is using looking-at for font-locking a good idea?
[02:30:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Wafficus: Submodules don't update themselves arbitrarily. They stay at the commit you last commited them to fetch.

[03:26:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Wafficus: In the Emacs' info manual view, the sections "Fundamental Editing Commands" and "Important Text-Changing Commands" contain similarly useful information.
[03:27:35] <dale> Wafficus: You might also like ,,expand-region
[03:27:36] <fsbot> expand-region is [0] an emacs extension to increase selected region by semantic units, see https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el
[03:27:36] <fsbot> [1] tl;dr bang on e.g. C-= a few times until the progressively bigger thing under point that is selected is the one you want

[06:26:59] <dale> Viking667: Do you ever use LaTeX?
[06:27:08] <Viking667> Yes, quite often.
[06:27:55] <Viking667> To be fair, I was totally unaware that something.cls was even considered to be a file handled by LaTeX.
[06:28:25] <Viking667> I'm normally aware of .sty, .tex, and most of the other relatively-well-known file suffixes.
[06:28:33] <dale> Viking667: Seems like you might want to add some new stuff to either interpreter-mode-alist or magic-mode-alist to try and guess the file type based on its contents.  See the docs for those as well as set-auto-mode.
[06:28:58] <dale> Viking667: foo.cls files are the thing loaded use when you do \documentclass{foo}.
[06:29:00] <Viking667> mmm. I did quickly look at magic-mode-alist
[06:29:18] <Viking667> dale: ah, I see. 
[06:29:22] <dale> The one catch is that it probably won't help you with new (i.e. empty) files.
[06:29:38] <dale> But really, if you're not opening .cls files with LaTeX, you might just remap it globally in your auto-mode-alist, i.e. in your init.el.
[06:29:39] <Viking667> In general, I'm dealing with files that already exist.
[06:31:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (alist-get "a" (list (list "a" 42)) nil nil #'string=) vs (alist-get "a" (list (cons "a" 42)) nil nil #'string=)
[06:31:25] <Viking667> Right. So, appending that line that Aurora_v_kosmose first posted to my .dir-locals.el, would that work or not?
[06:32:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So, technically the first also works, but it's an improper alist.
[06:32:01] <Viking667> this:   (push (cons "\\.cls\\'" . 'example-mode) auto-mode-alist)
[06:32:14] <Viking667> Ah, I see. I think.

[07:05:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Refresh my memory, what was authinfo used for?
[07:06:40] <Wafficus> I think it contains your username and password for whatever program you want
[07:06:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (info "(auth) Top") ;; Ah, apparently a generic framework for authentication.
[07:06:47] <Wafficus> in this case it would be username and password for ERC aka IRC
[07:06:59] <Wafficus> I think its also used for gnus and mu-4e as well

[07:28:06] <ParsnipChicken> does anyone use emacs as a mail client? Im using thunderbird rn. How hard is it to configure?
[07:28:18] <kakuhen> depends on what you choose to configure

[07:30:09] <ParsnipChicken> sry only one ?
[07:30:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Both Gnus and mu4e effectively require you to sync or fetch mail externally, whether via pop3 or some other methods.
[07:30:28] <ahungry> I like gnus, mutt was good also, but gnus lets me integrate better into the rest of my emacs environment
[07:30:28] <ahungry>  
[07:30:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Gnus nominally supports imap, but such a mode of usage is unbearably slow.
[07:30:38] <oats> mu4e <3
[07:30:47] <danrobi70> ParsnipChicken: I havent figured how to use Gnus with my Yahoo account yet. Im all in for a good config example :)
[07:30:51] <ahungry> yea, imap gnus, very slow - I pull down mail over imap using mbsync
[07:30:55] <kakuhen> Yeah I'm gonna try setting up Gnus, eventually, mostly because of the newsgroup functionality that I may or may not try
[07:31:02] <kakuhen> and it already comes bundled with emacs so may as well try it out
[07:31:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ParsnipChicken: I don't really know because I never used mutt.
[07:31:14] <ahungry> mbsync is not too hard to configure to work with gmail, or more normal mail inboxes either (I run my own postfix/dovecot setup on a vps as well)
[07:31:15] <ParsnipChicken> ok
[07:31:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'd say mu4e is a lot easier to configure, but that's because I like Lisp and get it.
[07:31:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can compare it to claws mail or thunderbird though.
[07:32:01] <ParsnipChicken> interesting
[07:32:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You have a much broader and more customizable search capacity, better tagging, much faster everything...
[07:32:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mail actions like deleting attachments and the like are relatively easy to implement.
[07:33:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Something that can be useful on mailing lists.
[07:33:19] <ahungry> bbdb is nice, and gnus works well with it for managing contacts
[07:33:50] <ahungry> gnus was the first emacs mail client I tried, I don't remember if I set it up first to try out usenet (eternal september) with it, or if I just happened to set it for email and then tried out usenet

[07:41:47] <Wafficus> ah so you basically use GPG to encrypt it afterwards
[07:41:49] <Wafficus> so
[07:41:53] <Wafficus> touch a file named ~/.authinfo
[07:41:58] <Wafficus> *~/.authinfo.gpg

[07:45:10] <ParsnipChicken> how do you set up openSSL for offlineimap?
[07:46:27] <ahungry> Wafficus: I would try doing the sample file, and confirming opening the .gpg version of it in Emacs will prompt you for the passphrase to decrypt it, that you used in the -c step of encrypting (or no prompt, if your gpg-agent has cached it)
[07:46:39] <ahungry> That way, you'll know the epa- package stuff is working properly with Emacs
[07:47:17] <ahungry> Then, pick which way you would want to manage your ~/.authinfo.gpg - if you encrypt with -c, that's symmetric and will be a passphrase that is not linked to your main master key you made with gen-key
[07:47:34] <ahungry> if you'd prefer to only decrypt the master key from gen-key, add yourself as sole recipient with the -r flag, and not the -c flag, on encryption

[07:48:16] <ahungry> So, "touch ~/.authinfo && gpg -r you@example.com ~/.authinfo && ls -l ~/.authinfo.gpg"
[07:48:32] <ahungry> you should see the gpg file exists, and you should be able to open as if it were a normal file in Emacs
[07:49:01] <ahungry> if all that works, on any program that needs to read from ~/.authinfo, Emacs should just "know" to read from ~/.authinfo.gpg instead (although you may need to remove the original ~/.authinfo as well)

[08:52:52] <Viking667> I don't know if that's correct, but if length is a function that takes one arg (in this case, window-list) then you're trying to see if length's reply is equal to 1
[08:53:19] <Viking667> I suspect your line is trying to pass two arguments to length and expecting length to know what to do with them.

[09:19:08] <Akawama[m]> dale that's what I have in my init.el, I don't know any lisp so no idea what I'm doing here :D. Should I change the whole thing?
[09:19:44] <dale> Akawama[m]: What you've got there is an append with one argument, that one argument being (list ...).  You're not appending anything to anything else, so in that case you could change (append (list ...)) to just (list ...).
[09:20:02] <danrobi70> Wafficus: not sure how elfeed deal with a txt file 'rss_feeds.txt'
[09:20:08] <danrobi70> does it works ?
[09:20:33] <Wafficus> no idea but I'm trying to figure out the format
[09:20:49] <dale> Akawama[m]: I suspect what you really want is something like https://bpa.st/VNWQ.
[09:21:01] <dale> Akawama[m]: This appends the existing value of default-frame-alist to that (list ...) you're passing in.
[09:21:33] <dale> Akawama[m]: So it's your list plus the existing contents of default-frame-alist.  Your list goes first so that the things in your list (hopefully) take precedence over any values that were already in there.
[09:21:53] <dale> Wafficus: Does rss_feeds.txt contain Elisp?  If not, you probably don't want to try and (load) it.
[09:22:15] <Akawama[m]> > Akawama: So it's your list plus the existing contents of default-frame-alist.  Your list goes first so that the things in your list (hopefully) take precedence over any values that were already in there.

[09:24:49] <Wafficus> danrobi70 yeah is .opml typically used for this?
[09:25:03] <Wafficus> dale what is often used for RSS feeds in this context though?
[09:25:06] <Wafficus> I only have ever used Newsboat
[09:25:10] <Wafficus> at in that program
[09:25:16] <Wafficus> you chuck the urls in ~.newsboat/urls
[09:25:30] <dale> Wafficus: I think OPML is common enough for "here's a list of RSS feeds".
[09:25:31] <Wafficus> which is a file where you specify the URL, then the tag on one line, repeat
[09:25:54] <danrobi70> syntax is pretty much same as newsboat
[09:25:55] <dale> Wafficus: Unfortunately, though, I don't use elfeed so I don't know what it wants.
[09:26:14] <Wafficus> hmm gotcha
[09:26:21] <danrobi70> Wafficus: give a sec I'll send an example
[09:26:34] <Wafficus> this is what it has (setq elfeed-feeds

[09:26:42] <Wafficus> for the example in the GitHub

[09:27:58] <Wafficus> ? danrobi70
[09:28:21] <danrobi70> ya replace with  (setq elfeed-feeds (quote
[09:28:37] <dale> Wafficus: Sounds like danrobi70 may have a better answer, but I'll add: there's probably no reason you can't put that whole (setq ...) in ~/.emacs.d/secrets/whatever/my-feeds.el then (load (expand-file-name "secrets/whatever/my-feeds.el" user-emacs-directory)) in an opportune point in your init.el.

[10:32:30] * bhavin192 (0830 UTC / 1030 Berlin / 1400 Kolkata / 1630 Singapore / 1830 Sydney)
[10:32:45] <dminuoso> Mmm, do I have to subscribe to the emacs mailing lists before I can send to them? gnu.org doesn't publically show the email addresses for them
[10:34:07] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[10:34:35] <bhavin192> dminuoso, AFAIK subscription is not required to send an email. I myself have sent such emails few times. It might take some time to show up in the HTML archives.
[10:35:04] <dminuoso> bhavin192: Ah hold on, I have to go to the list information page to see the mail address.
[10:35:12] <dminuoso> ttps://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=emacs
[10:35:15] <dminuoso> https://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=emacs
[10:35:18] <wasamasa> I'd recommend using the reply button on the web view
[10:35:24] <dminuoso> Was just confused because here it says "-email is unavailable-" :)
[10:35:35] <wasamasa> that ensures that the reply is enqueued into the right thread
[10:37:35] <bhavin192> +1 to what wasamasa said. I also use the reply button from web view and add the list email I get from listinfo page. 
[10:37:58] <wasamasa> the problem with that though is that you need an email client that understands mailto: links
[10:38:00] <wasamasa> otherwise it won't work
[10:38:09] <wasamasa> so I had to hack around to make mutt learn that

[19:48:45] <bpalmer> muradm: you may want to use let instead of setq for those variables.
[19:49:06] <bpalmer> (let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b))   <-- results in 3 , and a and b go away after the let is done.
[19:49:25] <bpalmer> whereas (setq a 1) (setq b 2) (+ a b)  <-- results in 3, but a and b stay around.

[19:59:12] <andreyorst> does anyone know how to make eshell keep buffer centering after pressing C-l like for inferior buffers?
[19:59:13] *** Joins: roadie (~user@2a02:8108:ec0:1427:c4eb:c4c8:2574:ac8d)
[19:59:45] <andreyorst> for inferior buffers I can do this by removing `comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom' from `comint-output-filter-functions', but this doesn't affect eshell

[20:01:18] <andreyorst> e.g. I'm pressing C-l C-l and current line is at the top, but after I input anything to eshell, it recenters current line to bottom

[20:23:44] <muradm> wasamasa: do you know why "npm run " does not color output? i have other non-npm process which coloting properly in comint, but "npm config get color" returns true, however when doing "npm run" it is "black and white"

[20:28:49] <muradm> wasamasa: so in short "npm run ..." won't write colors in comint no matter what?
[20:29:20] <wasamasa> you cannot know that
[20:29:32] <wasamasa> the thing after the "npm run" bit runs some JS thing
[20:29:47] <wasamasa> that JS thing may use colors, may use them in a dumb way or may not use them at all
[20:30:20] <muradm> eh.. uh.. face palm
[20:30:36] <muradm> then black and wite
[20:30:49] <wasamasa> that's an appropriate reaction to "modern" software development
[20:31:30] <muradm> basically, you say i have to track whatever thing is printing, see how it prints, and satisfy it
[20:31:41] <wasamasa> no, just lower your expectations
[20:32:39] <wasamasa> your options are to either use a terminal (then all the terminal things will work, including autodetection whether something is a terminal) or to accept, that node stuff will be annoying and refuse to work properly outside of a macos terminal
