[16:37:14] <willcode4[m]> Barry Duggan: In 3.10, the PDU blocks move to their own `pdu` namespace instead of `blocks`, where they were in 3.9. If you delete and re-add the block, things should be all set. Or, maybe even if you just regenerate the python code from GRC. If there's still a problem remove the GRC cache
[16:37:14] <willcode4[m]> `rm $HOME/.cache/grc_gnuradio/*`
[16:40:21] <willcode4[m]> If you run multiple versions of GR, then it's helpful to
[16:40:21] <willcode4[m]> `export GR_CONF_GRC_GLOBAL_BLOCKS_PATH=/specific/version/prefix/share/gnuradio/grc`
[16:40:21] <willcode4[m]> to avoid picking up yml files from other versions.

[17:25:03] <BarryDuggan[m]> willcode4: yes, I found that deleting and adding the blocks worked fine. I just wanted to understand why.
[17:26:26] <BarryDuggan[m]> Also I found that the format of the Message Debug output changed between versions. the data is the same, but the format is different. is this expected?
[17:30:26] <BarryDuggan[m]> In 3.9.4.0 -... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/9225ce35254832632ee39a37dc5a898eb1954826)
[17:32:06] <willcode4[m]> There have been some changes and deprecations in that block, so not too surprising. The example you give also probably relies on the pmt print functions.
[17:32:09] <BarryDuggan[m]> From master -... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/be2a28176a00483b1bc3b59328883497ca93594a)

[23:04:40] <schneider> After 1 hour or less, the unit should stabilize the frequency, and all event indicators should
[23:04:42] <schneider> be off resulting in the Green LOCK LED to be lit up.
[23:05:13] <schneider> I guess I never waited that long
[23:07:07] <Hash[m]> That because of an OCXO that has to settle?
[23:07:44] <schneider> this one has a TCXO, which advertises "fast locking"
[23:07:50] <Yamakaja[m]> Probably the high uncertainty when trying to align against a 1 PPS source
[23:08:26] <Yamakaja[m]> So you need absolutely tiny loop bandwidths, and the corresponding time constants will be huge
[23:08:37] <Yamakaja[m]> That's just a guess though :P
[23:09:44] <schneider> Warm Up Time / Stabilization Time: <10 min at +25°C to 1E-09 Accuracy 
[23:09:52] <schneider> Yamakaja[m]: yeah
[23:10:14] <schneider> apparently it is possible to also change the loop parameters of the GPSDO
[23:10:39] <schneider> (and i don't know if the previous owner changed them)
[23:11:45] <schneider> the thing is rather: query_gpsdo_sensors says that the device is locked, but the LED says it is not. it seems like there are different interpetations of what "locked" means

[23:13:42] <Hash[m]> I have the Leo Bodnar GPSDO that I’ve used when I need better precision than what the B200 has but it seems to lock very fast, not sure if it’s as precise though

[23:22:20] <schneider> Hash[m]: compared to the internal GPSDO option of the B200?
[23:23:04] <Hash[m]> Yea, this one only cost about $200 and is 1e-9 precision

[23:23:59] <Hash[m]> Second one down on the page is what I bought a few years back
[23:24:32] <Hash[m]> Compared to B200 with no internal GPSDO
[23:25:06] <Hash[m]> Yea, what you said :)
[23:30:07] <schneider> Hash[m]: BTW: I think the topic needs an update. 3.9.2 is not the latest release anymore
[23:30:29] <schneider> Hash[m]: sorry, didn't mean to highlight you
