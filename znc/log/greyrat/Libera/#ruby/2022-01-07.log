[08:19:30] <havenwood> jaredo: I'd garner they're similarly popular. Looking at RubyGems API, I see 6,608 reverse dependencies for yard and 4,477 for rdoc — for a ballpark idea.
[08:19:55] <havenwood> https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/rdoc/reverse_dependencies.json
[08:20:01] <havenwood> https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/yard/reverse_dependencies.json
[08:20:12] <jaredo> rdoc comes with ruby though, so I think that's probably not accurate for rdoc
[08:21:00] <havenwood> jaredo: It shouldn't have a bearing on reverse dependencies.
[08:21:10] <havenwood> jaredo: This is looking at what says it depends on rdoc and yard gems.
[08:21:41] <jaredo> would a gem that uses rdoc have rdoc as a dep, if its already included?
[08:21:47] <jaredo> I assumed not
[08:22:21] <havenwood> jaredo: It can, and 4,477 do.
[08:22:32] <jaredo> interesting
[08:22:34] <jaredo> thanks
[08:22:47] <jaredo> I guess this is as close as I will get to proof
[08:23:40] <havenwood> 109,403,531 downloads for rdoc and 78,433,728 for yard.
[08:24:30] <havenwood> jaredo: Reverse deps advantage yard and downloads advantage rdoc. I think similar but can't think of a better way to prove it.
[08:24:43] <havenwood> np, you're welcome
[08:25:17] <havenwood> Like you say, rdoc is probably used without folk listing it as an explicit dep.
[08:25:32] <havenwood> Unsure if the download count actually counts default installs. I actually think it doesn't.
[08:25:54] <havenwood> So rdoc may be more popular than it appears from reverse deps alone.
[08:25:57] <havenwood> They're both popular.
[08:26:12] <havenwood> Yard is something of a superset of rdoc, so go figure.
[08:26:40] <havenwood> I've heard havendoc is probably best.

[23:52:15] <havenwood> nakilon: I'd use async-websocket, for sure.
[23:53:11] <havenwood> nakilon: What type of app? I made an async-websocket plugin for Roda. https://github.com/socketry/roda-websockets
[23:53:42] <havenwood> Jeremy Evans offered to link it on Roda's website and I forgot to circle back. Gotta do that. :)
[23:54:25] <adam12> havenwood: You should do that, since I feel like the topic came up just recently again.
[23:54:55] <adam12> Oh actually, they did link it in the discussion and I didn't even notice it. https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda/discussions/230
[23:55:01] <havenwood> adam12: Will do! I need to update the README to socketry's style then I'll PR.
[23:56:06] <havenwood> Need to quit my job so I have time. :P
[23:56:14] <havenwood> No time! No time!
[23:56:21] <adam12> LOL
[23:56:34] <adam12> I hear ya :\
[23:57:03] <havenwood> adam12: Another thing I'd do with time is get really up to speed on Axon. https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon/
[23:57:14] <adam12> Neat.

[23:57:44] <havenwood> Almost tempted to attempt a Ruby wrapper.
[23:58:24] <adam12> I'm not sure I'll write any more Elixir, other than maintaining my OSS Elixir I already have in the wild. Maybe if I'm paid and not in a consultant role, I would. I just find it incredibly opaque when coming back to old code. More so than Ruby. Maybe it's just being too accustomed to Ruby.

[23:58:55] <havenwood> adam12: I'm more comfortable in Ruby too. Nx revived my Elixir interest.
[23:59:39] <havenwood> https://dashbit.co/blog/elixir-and-machine-learning-nx-v0.1
[23:59:49] <havenwood> Nx 0.1 just released, too.
