[00:48:42] <ThePendulum> how did you get a mannekin
[00:48:49] <ThePendulum> mannequin 
[00:50:04] <skye0> maxing out the fashion designer job for at least one of your sims
[00:50:19] <skye0> and getting them to create a masculine/feminine trend through clicking on those sims
[00:50:20] <ThePendulum> ahh, it's optional I hope? 
[00:50:24] <skye0> and maybe also publishing it with a computer
[00:50:27] <skye0> optional?

[00:50:33] <unfinity> skye0 you befriended a duck in 5.579 seconds! You have made friends with 104 ducks in #datahoarder.
[00:50:46] <skye0> sometimes you encounter sims wearing the exact same clothes you created
[00:50:54] <skye0> i happen to like this look as one of them
[00:52:03] <ThePendulum> like you can still dress real sins
[00:52:05] <ThePendulum> sims

[00:52:55] <skye0> yup
