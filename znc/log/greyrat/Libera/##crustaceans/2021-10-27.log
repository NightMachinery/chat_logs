[00:04:07] <prussian> I forgot about prop 65
[00:04:18] <prussian> so does everything cause cancer?
[00:04:24] <prussian> what's the consensus ?
[00:04:27] <ngoldbaum> IRC known to the state of california to cause cancer
[00:04:49] <Brekkjern> Is that wrong though?
[00:05:18] <prussian> hard to say. we need a multigenerational expensive medical study to find out.
[00:05:35] <ngoldbaum> discord certainly does
[00:05:36] <prussian> I will accept my multimillion dollar grant now.
[00:18:38] <bkero> Speaking of DDR5 earlier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJEq7H4Wf6U
[00:18:38] <buttsbot> DDR5 is FINALLY HERE... and I've got it - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJEq7H4Wf6U
[00:22:11] <Brekkjern> I was wondering when it would show up
[00:26:03] <prussian> bkero: does it suck?
[00:26:20] <bkero> real bad latencies, which we already knew
[00:26:45] <prussian> I'm still on DDR3
[00:28:24] <ngoldbaum> i bet this would be fun to watch https://twitter.com/involcan/status/1453075699036741633

[00:28:36] <ngoldbaum> those lava fountains are thousands of feet tall
[00:28:58] <prussian> so when can I expect to have serial attached dram?
[00:29:02] <prussian> lol
[00:29:26] <prussian> oh I forgot about the la palma thing.
[00:30:30] <imode> are we in danger of a tsunami.
[00:30:36] <prussian> idk
[00:30:40] <Brekkjern> I wonder if there will be some separate lower-latency RAM in the future. Kinda like a separate cache
[00:31:36] <Brekkjern> At least for gaming, there is probably a lot of things that aren't as latency sensitive (textures, models, etc), and other stuff that is.
[00:32:04] <Brekkjern> So having two sets of RAM, one fast and one bulk storage would probably make some types of processes wildly faster
[00:32:15] <bkero> You mean like L3 cache and RAM?
[00:32:20] <Brekkjern> Not really
[00:32:25] <Brekkjern> I still mean "larger than L3"
[00:32:44] <Brekkjern> Just that it's faster than the current RAM
[00:33:00] <bkero> That's some non-trivial memory training.
[00:33:06] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[00:33:27] <bkero> 72MB of L2/L3 on current AMD CPUs is still pretty significant.
[00:33:32] <Brekkjern> True
[00:34:00] <Brekkjern> What I am thinking about is being able to tell your program that you should store this datastructure in the fast memory because when you need it, you need it now
[00:34:38] <prussian> wait... DDR5 is required to have ECC capacity?
[00:34:43] <prussian> weird.
[00:34:59] <Brekkjern> While other things are stuff where you could possibly plan ahead when processing it, so you don't care so much about latency.
[00:35:36] <Brekkjern> I'm spitballing ideas here. I don't actually know shit about this.
[00:35:56] <prussian> I think the problem with that is C-isms basically force a singular memoryspace for all the things to exist in
[00:36:39] <deadk> do they though
[00:38:43] <deadk> there are plenty of systems people write C for with weird memory architectures
[00:39:17] *** Joins: gthm (~gthm@ip-213-127-57-210.ip.prioritytelecom.net)
[00:45:59] *** Quits: gthm (~gthm@ip-213-127-57-210.ip.prioritytelecom.net) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[00:51:11] <prussian> deadk: I'd say so. All those hierarchies and device memories would have to be mapped somehow to something a ptr can point to.
[00:52:24] <prussian> Brekkjern: idk. Like with a website, you could guess what should be in cache, but the running system will probably fill the cache better. Same with CPU, barring obvious bad uses, but I don't think a compiler could soothsay around bad cache use either.
[00:53:37] <deadk> prussian: there's no rule that says a pointer has to be a single number
[00:54:41] <deadk> though in practice the architectures that have won all map everything into one big address space anyway
[00:55:16] <deadk> the DS had like 5 different RAMs with different properties
[00:56:32] <prussian> Didn't mention a number 🙃
[00:57:17] <deadk> it seems implicit that pointers are somehow constrained if it's a burden to have to map everything to something they can point to
[00:57:23] <deadk> but they aren't, and it isn't
[01:02:53] <Brekkjern> prussian: I was thinking more like you know when you need to process a texture for example, so you can plan that ahead and stream process a lot of that data. Latency doesn't matter so much then, but when you suddenly have to do a search to find the closest something in a game world, and your program can't continue before you have an answer, then that would have benefit from lower latency
[01:03:03] <Brekkjern> I'm just playing with the idea though
[01:03:34] <deadk> there are processors with extremely fast cache-like memory
[01:03:46] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but that memory is small
[01:03:49] <deadk> yeah
[01:04:16] <deadk> i think the DS had some form of TCM!
[01:04:18] <Brekkjern> I'm talking about having 2GB of lower latency RAM, and 16GB of slower ram
[01:04:58] <deadk> i don't think there's any technical reason why you couldn't do that in theory, but here are lots why you can't do it today, and i don't know if it would be worth fixing all of them
[01:05:14] <Brekkjern> True
[01:06:02] <Brekkjern> Eh. Rather going to bed than think more about this
[01:06:04] <Brekkjern> Night!
[01:06:08] <deadk> gn
[01:12:32] <dimadima> kline inspired me and i'm writing tests
[01:13:06] <dimadima> well, that and my loss of control over certain complexity :/
[01:14:07] <dimadima> still not really understanding how testing can possibly  amount to 2% of programming effort
[01:20:40] <imode> the gamecube had ARAM, which was incredibly low latency memory intended to be used for audio processing.
[01:23:04] <deadk> nintendo has always seemed to go for not much hardware, but what's there is ultra-specialized
[01:23:35] <deadk> i think the enemy of this is general purpose computing, though, rather than any evolutionary local minima imposed by programming techniques
[01:24:33] <deadk> it's worth designing your game to take advantage of hardware that's in every one of a popular games console
[01:36:03] <bkero> Ulra-specialized Tegra chip they left the Home button attached to
[01:43:06] <indigo> Just curious, what is everyone's rule when splitting something into another function? I usually look for argument to function size ratio (less args to bigger function implies a good candidate to me)
[01:43:44] <bkero> I usually do it when vim yells at me, typically because I have too many conditional codepaths
[01:43:50] <bkero> or am nesting too deeply
[01:44:10] <bkero> I think it does it at 4 or 5 levels of indentation
[01:45:27] <dimadima> indigo: testability
[01:45:50] <dimadima> bkero: vim yells on conditional codepaths?
[01:46:05] <bkero> Syntastic emits some linters that do
[01:46:11] <indigo> I feel like some folks are way too rigid on the "functions should only be 40 lines, if they are bigger, split things off"
[01:46:12] <bkero> It must have been pylint or pep8
[01:46:39] <dimadima> i'm no master software developer but hard rules like that seem stupid right
[01:46:47] <indigo> What ends up happening is poor readability; something diced up into tens of little functions with poor APIs
[01:49:25] <dimadima> yep
[01:51:01] <dimadima> are you encountering push-back to this
[01:54:37] <imode> line counts are poor substitutes for semantic boundaries.
[01:55:01] <indigo> I have encountered push back in the past, but we'll see this time
[01:55:58] <indigo> The reason I ask is that instead of adding to an existing function, I inlined it instead and then added the code to the parent function... which might be seen as a little weird but it seems more readable to me :-)
[01:56:35] <kline> dimadima, gz
[01:56:52] <kline> and remember, just because you write tests doesnt mean you can stop using good type designs
[01:57:18] <indigo> Oh man... I remember writing tests for poor designs
[01:57:25] <indigo> So many mocks... everything was mocked up the wazoo
[01:57:58] <ngoldbaum> everyone’s always mocking mocks
[01:58:06] <ngoldbaum> in their smocks
[02:00:06] <imode> s m o c k s
[02:03:17] <dimadima> kline: yeah my type "designs" are pretty minimial they're mostly structs
[02:03:23] <dimadima> aka data types
[02:03:30] <dimadima> there aren't many moving parts to my system
[02:03:45] <dimadima> but i do use mocks a lot
[02:03:58] <dimadima> cause i compose things a lot
[02:04:06] <indigo> More like docker-compose amirite
[02:04:22] <dimadima> and i think it's good; but i wonder how it would hold up to more experienced ppl's scrutiny
[02:04:27] <dimadima> zomg
[02:05:28] <dimadima> i'm so 1337 i only use docker-compose in local development
[02:05:38] <ngoldbaum> imo just write unit tests with the real types unless you are testing something like a data source you don’t control or a remote API you don’t control
[02:06:01] <dimadima> i'm kinda jealous of you game developers chatting about low latency ram and stuff
[02:06:28] <dimadima> indigo: if it reads better, it reads better. i wonder what your people will say!
[02:06:57] <dimadima> i'm pretty resigned to giving no fucks about stuff like that if i find myself employed and have engineering managers who want things coded one way over another
[02:07:47] <dimadima> i wonder how long that would hold up in reality
[02:08:00] <dimadima> eventually you get arbitrarily emotionally invested in stuff

[02:12:10] * ngoldbaum has a smol twix
[02:13:16] <indigo> dimadima: As my therapist says, it's best to have a moderate amount of emotional investment
[02:14:11] <imode> dimadima: it's just some fun stuff you get to discover eventually and then commit to memory. computing can be exciting or it can be for money, but it's very rarely both.
[02:14:50] <skyl4rk> smocks, the lisp testing framework
[02:16:01] <kline> ngoldbaum, you can have a small twix, as a treat
[02:16:33] <ngoldbaum> small a twix
[02:17:19] <dimadima> indigo: thank you it's good to know the professionally-recommended guidance in that department
[02:18:35] <indigo> dimadima: To be fair, it's probably better to get your own guidance... therapists are pricy though :(
[02:20:22] <dimadima> you can't put a price on peace of mind
[02:20:31] <dimadima> ... or can you? :)
[02:21:36] <bkero> You can pay therapists with an HSA though
[02:21:39] <indigo> You can, apparently it is the difference between what imode is currently making and a non-amazon job
[02:21:48] <indigo> Sorry imode :P
[02:22:24] <indigo> bkero: True! I use my HSA as a retirement account though

[02:22:41] <imode> indigo: low blow.
[02:22:43] <imode> :P
[02:23:06] <imode> the truth is I don't know or trust any therapists around here.
[02:23:55] <indigo> I'm a little bit meh on mine; we have a company sponsored program but it's a little too rigid for my taste
[02:29:42] <imode> we're going to realize that mental health is more complex than "go here and unload".
[02:29:52] <imode> and solutions to it are not "scalable".
[02:30:03] <indigo> Yeah, SV + mental health sounds like a disaster
[02:30:46] <dimadima> my wife works at a children's mental health non-profit and interviewed with an SV mental health start up
[02:31:10] <dimadima> they were definitely trying to make it scalable

[06:20:15] <indigo> If it doesn’t work well they can always go back
[06:21:10] <imode> nobody wants to use the shit-tier in-development language that has a complex compiler with little vetting compared to the standard that's been around since the 80s.

[06:22:07] <imode> nah.
[06:22:16] <imode> ngoldbaum: hah. no, rust.
[06:22:21] <imode> good joke though, C++ sucks worse.
[06:22:46] <imode> the above is the mindset of the people in that thread.
[06:23:08] <ngoldbaum> i mean if we’re gonna make exaggerated characterizations of prog langs here
[06:23:39] <ngoldbaum> it’s so weird to me to learn that google’s fuschia uses a bunch of suckless userland stuff
[06:23:55] <imode> genuinely. in their eyes, rust is not mature enough for the kernel. it's alright in the stuff _outside_ the kernel, the pluggable components.
[06:24:48] *** cd is now known as moon
[06:25:03] <imode> the core, not so much. and to some extent, they're right. "rewrite it in rust" or "integrate rust into it" is a nontrivial thing to do and find maintainers for.
[06:25:44] <imode> even worse, it encourages contributions by people who trust the compiler way too much for their own good.
[06:25:56] <imode> patch review is also a thing.
[06:26:07] *** moon is now known as moony
[06:27:26] <imode> despite the fact that C sucks ass in terms of its guarantees, it's still a fairly reasonable intermediate language for people submitting things. a lot of the rust code that I've seen is just obstructively noisy, but that's my opinion.
[06:32:54] <cb_> ngoldbaum: rust is just sjw c++ /s
[06:34:14] <imode> that dude on HN is crazy though.

[06:35:41] <companion_cube> hu, funny
[06:35:44] <companion_cube> I never heard of that
[06:35:51] <companion_cube> is there a reason to use sbase rather than busybox?
[06:35:56] <ngoldbaum> instead of busybox yeab
[06:36:01] <ngoldbaum> not sure no
[06:36:05] <imode> licensing maybe?
[06:36:20] <cb_> companion_cube: busybox is linux specific
[06:36:36] <cb_> i.e. the stuff like cut and rm is intermingled with linux specific stuff
[06:36:51] <cb_> sbase is just the portable parts and there's a diff set for the OS specific parts
[06:36:51] <companion_cube> oh I see.
[06:37:13] <companion_cube> pff, when there's also coreutils being done in rust 🙃
[06:38:09] <imode> the push shouldn't be "another C". the push should be "institute a similar borrow checker in languages that don't have it in their standards, or start spreading this logic around via tools".
[06:38:42] <companion_cube> imode: that's truly impossible to retrofit in existing languages
[06:38:58] <companion_cube> I mean, the kernel could use checked C, I guess. afaik it still doesn't bring you a borrow checker.
[06:39:12] <cb_> i posted a submission that suggests adding one to C++ may be hard to impossible, and C's type system is way too inexpressive for one
[06:40:11] <cb_> and if you somehow did, fucking nothing in the C ecosystem would pass the borrow checker because you not only need to raise the types but there's a solid chance the program needs to be rearchitectred
[06:40:23] <companion_cube> C doesn't even have a notion of move semantics :D
[06:40:35] <cb_> if you want to make existing languages safer, then formal methods may be an easier onramp
[06:40:52] <cb_> more force functions to be proven
[06:41:38] <imode> probably. it's less invasive.
[06:41:46] <imode> directly, anyway.
[06:41:56] <companion_cube> cb_: stuff like frama-C?
[06:42:03] <cb_> that seems like one yeah
[06:42:22] <companion_cube> it's probably a lot more work to use than rust, though
[06:42:34] <companion_cube> I mean, it's cool. It's just the hardest path
[06:42:44] <imode> have you used it? has anybody here.. used it?
[06:42:47] <imode> I haven't.
[06:42:57] <cb_> i haven't either, but i also haven't used rust either
[06:42:58] <companion_cube> I had some lectures on it at univ :D
[06:43:04] <cb_> mostly bc it's not available for my dayjob
[06:43:07] <companion_cube> almost got a job working on the tool, actually
[06:43:10] <imode> we make assumptions based on the judgements of others but I haven't actually used either languages in anything.
[06:43:11] <companion_cube> rust is… usable
[06:43:22] <companion_cube> depending on what you do, it can be pretty nice
[06:44:35] <ngoldbaum> the common C convention of passing opaque pointers to data and mutating the data in a function wouldn’t work with the borrow checker
[06:44:45] <ngoldbaum> that’s… a lot of C APIs
[06:45:09] <Church> Opaque being a void pointer right?
[06:45:11] <imode> that's true, but it doesn't mean you can't generate checked C code if you annotate those things. basically form a language that generates sanitary C code fit for human review.
[06:45:13] <companion_cube> if the functions take a &mut, it would
[06:45:20] <companion_cube> but yeah you have to rewrite APIs
[06:45:28] <Church> Eyep
[06:45:46] <companion_cube> again, you could start with checked C
[06:45:57] <companion_cube> for something a bit less insane, and at least forward compatible with C
[06:46:23] <imode> we should be able to have our cake and eat it too.

[09:24:33] <klardotsh> is it so bad that folks are building things that folks find interesting?
[09:25:54] <klardotsh> oh never f'ing mind. I hadn't read far enough on their page to see it was crypto BS
[09:26:47] <klardotsh> or rather, had scrolled past the hero header because I routinely scroll past those to find the real content, saw the follow-up paragraphs that looked interesting, and thus missed the lines talking about "on-chain activity"

[16:22:58] <gwozniak> Driving across the country to deliver a car to my dad
[16:23:24] <gwozniak> So, sort of fun
[16:23:49] <dimadima> you're driving across the country gwozniak ?!
[16:24:18] <dimadima> i'm sure this will make me sound like a complete ass, but i didn't know people in canada did that
[16:24:20] <ngoldbaum> fargo vibes
[16:24:25] <gwozniak> Yup. About 4000km
[16:24:30] <ngoldbaum> driving across canada in november
[16:24:33] <dimadima> as in, is it a cultural thing to do
[16:25:32] <dimadima> so this isn't the gift you were talking about the other week? that was an ATV iirc
[16:26:01] <gwozniak> My sister gifted her car to my dad.  Rather than ship it out there, I'm going to drive it to him and we're all going to visit
[16:26:15] <gwozniak> And yeah, we bought him an ATV as well

[16:26:59] <gwozniak> And he needs these things, too
[16:27:50] <gwozniak> He takes care of a large property, so the ATV will help him get around
[16:29:07] <gwozniak> Technically, I'm driving across about 3/5 of the country
[16:29:28] <gwozniak> But southern Ontario to the middle of BC is a long drive
[16:30:26] <ngoldbaum> good luck across alberta and saskatchewan
[16:30:39] <gwozniak> heh - the plan is not to stop there :)
[16:30:53] <gwozniak> Maybe Calgary, but I'm aiming to stop in Banff
[16:31:10] <gwozniak> I'll have to stop to get fuel, of course

[18:00:55] <deadk> it still contributes to crypto as an institution

[18:09:08] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: that's a good question
[18:13:29] <kline> dimadima, selling NFTs is undeniably ethical in comparison to stealing wallets or guessing wallet generation phrases
[18:14:02] <kline> if you mean ethical in terms of energy usage, then im not really interested because theres no way to extract cash from cryptonerds that isnt energy expensive

[20:27:13] <dimadima> i've got a month left or so
[20:27:49] <imode> I have pfizer in my blood, so I don't know if I'm "alright" to take a booster... haven't kept up as to whether the Pfizer booster is out of development yet.
[20:28:43] <companion_cube> you can mix and match
[20:28:49] <companion_cube> so you could get a moderna booster, afaict
[20:28:52] <dimadima> to my knowledge the booster is just a 3rd pfizer shot
[20:29:01] <companion_cube> isn't it lower dosage?
[20:29:12] <dimadima> i assumed it was the same
[20:29:18] <dimadima> could be lower, no idea

[21:11:18] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: the myocarditis and blood clots were surprises, but they’re real albeit rare side effects
[21:14:27] <Xe> my 13 pro finally got in!
[21:14:35] <Xe> the fucking promotion is a game changer
[21:18:17] <ngoldbaum> i’m liking the 120 hz
[21:18:22] <ngoldbaum> the camera is also very nice
[21:18:45] <ngoldbaum> 5G still kinda blows near me, LTE is always faster
[21:22:51] <bkero> That's 5G for you
[21:24:48] <indigo> Xe: Congrats on the promotion!
[21:25:00] <ngoldbaum> LTE was like that too when they rolled it out
[21:31:49] <imode> Xe: graaaatz!
[21:36:56] <indigo> Just curious, why 13 instead of 14
[21:38:55] <ngoldbaum> wait phone or laptop
[21:39:14] <ngoldbaum> lmao i saw today that menu items render under the notch
[21:39:35] <ngoldbaum> so like in photoshop with lots of menu options in maximized screen you can’t see three of them
[21:40:01] <ngoldbaum> you’d think they’d be able to account for that in the window manager…

[21:50:49] * dimadima double checks that the iphone 14 does not, in fact, exist
[21:56:28] <kline> man
[21:56:32] <kline> i miss the classic memes
[21:56:46] <Church> One troll face coming up hot
[21:56:52] <Church> And a long cat for desert
[21:57:35] <kline> someone, somewhere, is still pushing for milhouse

[22:17:51] *** Joins: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost)
[22:18:37] <indigo> Oh derp. There is an 13 pro (iphone) and 13 pro (macbook) now
[22:20:26] <ngoldbaum> indigo: and we have like 5 more years to get confused about it
[22:20:35] <indigo> Greeeat
[22:20:46] <ngoldbaum> unless apple finally gives up on i++ and just does iphone (2022)
[22:20:48] <indigo> I'm still happy with my 11 (iphone, not pro)
[22:23:25] <indigo> Whew, I need to take a break after that last meeting
[22:23:45] <mouseghost> and i have an iphone se (2020, another confusion ;p)
[22:24:15] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: no, the next move is iPhone 360
[22:24:18] <indigo> TFW you're on a project that is quite draining and has a low probability of success
[22:24:19] <companion_cube> then iPhone One
[22:26:11] <mouseghost> iPhone Zero
[22:26:16] <mouseghost> the empty box
[22:26:36] <ngoldbaum> the next xbox will be the xbox two
[22:27:29] <dimadima> jesus
[22:27:45] <dimadima> some kid is fucking uploading his entire random pics dir to my backend automatically
[22:27:52] <dimadima> people are awesome
[22:29:05] <indigo> dimadima: Sir, you still didn't reply to my Pony
[22:30:46] <imode> indigo: tell me about it.
[22:31:26] <indigo> imode: Let's keep sending dank memes until he does
[22:31:49] <gwozniak> Shrek porn?
[22:32:09] <indigo> Damn gwozniak
[22:32:30] <indigo> More wholesome dank memes than that
[22:32:47] <dimadima> indigo: go it this morning! lol
[22:33:03] <dimadima> even if i wanted to reply, i could not
[22:33:16] <dimadima> what i want to do is reach across the internet is homer simpson this little prick
[22:33:51] <mouseghost> dimadima, what do you mean uploading to your backend
[22:34:13] <dimadima> although he is actually serving the exact purpose i hoped twitters ads would
[22:34:40] <dimadima> mouseghost: i've been advertising an app i built on twitter, sort of like soft launching it
[22:34:50] <dimadima> and i guess i found a kid who has scripted uploading shit to my backend
[22:34:51] <dimadima> files
[22:34:55] <dimadima> (the app allows attachments)
[22:35:04] <dimadima> and is now flooding it with garbage
[22:35:17] <mouseghost> hm
[22:35:19] <dimadima> <3 humanity
[22:36:29] <dimadima> yeah it's nothing exotic it's just funny, with enough twitter ads i've found ppl to fuck with my app in every way i put off for later
[22:36:32] <dimadima> to address
[22:36:37] <dimadima> "pfff i'll do rate limits later"
[22:36:38] <dimadima> lol
[22:37:22] <dimadima> yesterday i had a person automate composing messages to people and he wrote "hey buddy it was great to meet you today" to everyone with an open account
[22:38:26] <dimadima> anyway, sorry i'm flooding
[22:41:22] <gerikson> so @wentin just hung out for 2 months then posted a link to a site featured on ProductHunt: https://lobste.rs/s/rfaj1q/play_game_find_your_true_love_coding_fonts
[22:41:22] <buttsbot> Play a game to find your true love of coding fonts | Lobsters
[22:41:25] <gerikson> cool cool
[22:41:54] <dimadima> what do you meawn
[22:41:58] <dimadima> hung out
[22:42:18] <gerikson> joined 2 months ago, one story submitted
[22:42:29] <dimadima> oh gotcha
[22:42:32] <gerikson> and I saw that site on HN earlier today
[22:47:21] <dimadima> what kind of product is that even
[22:47:54] <dimadima> it's nice, i guess
[22:49:08] <indigo> We need to make a lobsters food pyramid
[22:49:35] <indigo> Those kind of posts should be in the “sweets” section
[22:49:45] <gerikson> je ne regrette rien: https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gerikson.com/gemlog/ebaums-world/gnushit.gmi

[22:49:47] <indigo> Sometimes, but not too much
[22:51:19] <imode> gerikson: i dunno it seems like there's a lot to regret there.
[22:53:02] <gerikson> someone posted a squatting gnus in #gnu, I just added the literal poo

[22:56:03] <prussian> powerful
[23:04:48] <dimadima> bcrypt is a good-enough rate limit for passwords amirite?
[23:05:01] <dimadima> >^..^<
[23:06:28] <dimadima> the fact is that anything squatting invites adding a turd
[23:06:38] <dimadima> i'm trying to teach my kid to squat when he shits
[23:07:04] * dimadima keeping the quality of conversation in this channel as high as possible
[23:10:07] <Brekkjern> I didn't create buttsbot to keep the quality of conversation high...
[23:12:23] <prussian> uh...
[23:12:25] <prussian> https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143510111059968
[23:12:25] <buttsbot> Twatter - SnazzyQ - WTF HAHAHAHA HOW IS THIS SHIPPABLE? WHAT IS THIS?! https://t.co/epse3Cv3xF
[23:12:28] <prussian> is this real?
[23:12:40] <prussian> I know people who preordered this...
[23:14:45] <Brekkjern> lol
[23:14:52] <Brekkjern> I love it
[23:15:03] <Brekkjern> Especially the proposed "solution" in the comments :p
[23:17:40] <prussian> the future is now
[23:20:03] <gwozniak> that guy is remarkably annoying
[23:20:08] <prussian> yes
[23:20:13] <prussian> but the problem is hilarious
[23:20:14] <imode> blech.
[23:20:17] <gwozniak> but that notch... I don't understand
[23:22:26] <ngoldbaum> like apple has complete control over the GUI
[23:22:43] <ngoldbaum> did they not want the GUI engineers to know the notch was coming?
[23:23:20] <prussian> I mean, I thought about this problem and I don't even use macOS anymore.
[23:23:27] <prussian> it seemed like something someone should have, well, seen?
[23:24:30] <imode> who the fuck cares about people using other apps.
[23:24:37] <imode> - apple, probably
[23:28:12] <prussian> probably
[23:28:23] <prussian> or more like, "WE WARNED APP DEVS LIKE, 10 SECONDS AGO"
[23:41:39] <drakonis> whyyyyyyyy
[23:53:59] <pja> How annoying. You can’t connect ssh to a unix domain socket.
[23:54:15] <pja> Rude.
[23:55:24] <kline> i honestly dont even mind notches
[23:55:34] <kline> not having the notch just means less screen real estate
[23:55:51] <kline> if you dont like it just tell your window manager or xserver or whatever not to render stuff in there
[23:56:08] <kline> admittedly, allowing people to lose stuff in it is a silly mistake, though
[23:59:00] <ngoldbaum> lol the mouse pointer disappears under it
