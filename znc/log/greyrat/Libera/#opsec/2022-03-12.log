[00:27:05] <JimBuntu> I have a number for Joanna... 5a-reductase 2 deficiency (what the guevedoce have)... is 0.00066% as common as dwarfism, globally, in 2020.
[00:33:28] <jan6> too bad there is no joanna here ;P
[00:34:57] <JimBuntu> yeah, oh well. I think that works out to roughly 0.0000056% of the population as a whole... or... just shy of 450 in total. meh

[03:18:00] <Joanna> If someone wanted to get bad code onto many computers, wouldn’t making panic over a vulnerability be a good strategy? Who’s to say that people aren’t jumping out of the frying pan into the fire every time?
[03:18:40] <Joanna> Maybe in reality computers are becoming more and more insecure with each update....
[03:19:34] <Joanna> A bug that lets anyone who has an account do anything seems rather rudimentary.
[03:21:03] <Joanna> I appreciate opensource projects but it’s possible that they have been infiltrated by bad actors.
[03:28:52] <jan6> depends who
[03:29:46] <jan6> because y'know, proccessor and firmware vulnerabilities and backdoors require no user action, if the big government-level people needed access
[03:30:02] <jan6> and it's not EVERY update, lol
[03:31:24] <jan6> and also, there's always the possibility of a Ken Thompson Hack being done again
[03:31:25] <jan6> especially with this evil "rust" language, which doesn't have an actual spec yet, and is moving too fast for anyone to reasonably keep up, if they tried to make their own compiler, and it's "bootstrapped" so you need rust to build rust already, being the perfect sort of loop
[03:32:29] <jan6> or alternatively you could built the latest version that didn't require rust to build (years ago), and iterate towards newer ones till you finally manage to build it from scratch, lol
[03:33:31] <jan6> Joanna: ANYTHING could be infiltrated, just with open source you have way more eyes looking at it, if there's an intentional fault/backdoor with a closed source program, then it's still there, you just don't KNOW it's there
[03:35:37] <jan6> it depends how paranoid you wanna get, lol, just build your own computer from scratch, design your own CPU, manifacture it yourself (or let it be made and delid and xray a lot of them just to make sure it corresponds with your design) etc etc
[03:36:13] <jan6> then build your own assembler, your own C compiler, and an OS
[03:37:24] <jan6> ALL software is gonna have some sort of vulnerabilities at one time or another, but the more complex stuff is, the harder it is to ensure EVERYTHING is safe
[03:38:15] <jan6> the more in flux something is, the higher the risk of mistakes and problems
[03:39:09] *** Quits: SANCLA (~SANCLA@hackalot/deelnemer/Sancla) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:39:28] <jan6> the worst kind of products are closed-source stuff, with horrible crappy code, because then you can't even fix it up, without completely reverse engineering everything (which takes a LOOOONG time, especially alone)

[14:00:39] <Joanna> Opensource concept of many eyes looking at the code sounds great in theory but in practice things are quite different and people get paid off or intimidated. So even if someone notices something strange about code does not at all guarantee that they will do anything about it. It’s a rather well known fact proven again and again that most people are passive and let thugs take over things and later suffer the consequences for not 
[14:00:39] <Joanna> stopping the thugs.
[14:02:27] <Joanna> Nobody wants to go against the consensus.

[15:23:22] <jan6> people would be happy IF they got paid off, but nobody does
[15:23:32] <jan6> you cannot pay off the whole world
[15:24:09] <jan6> you cannot delete mailing list messages (or github issues, unless you're github itself)
[15:25:02] <jan6> the point of open source's security is that given the fact ANYONE can look at the code, the amount of people who can find AND FIX bugs is not limited
[15:25:29] <jan6> and if the main project refuses your fix? you can simply fork the project!
[15:25:56] <jan6> and ooooh boy, there's a LOT of people who want to go against the consensus
[15:26:33] <jan6> they're still a minority
[15:29:22] <Joanna> Regardless of that at least opensource lets you change your own copy
