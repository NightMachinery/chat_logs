[00:02:20] <blue94[m]> Okay soooo
[00:02:31] <blue94[m]> Does any1 know how to convert they byte array from ZMQ into float/complex array?
[00:02:35] <blue94[m]> because thats what I think it is
[00:02:46] <blue94[m]> riggt?
[00:03:44] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@218.78.109.69)
[00:04:51] <blue94[m]> I can put it into float array alright
[00:05:09] <blue94[m]> and then every second float is the imaginary part or what?
[00:05:15] <blue94[m]> s/float///
[00:05:42] <blue94[m]> Im gonna reward myself with a late evening coffee because Im doing such a good progress here
[00:07:03] <willcode4[m]> There are a lot of type conversion blocks, if that's what you're looking for.
[00:12:08] <blue94[m]> Noo, I wanna do it programmatically 
[00:12:10] <blue94[m]> ZMQ sink for complex is broadcasting an array of bytes with each packet and each of this packets corresponds to an array of floats I reckon.
[00:12:22] <blue94[m]> So how do I turn it back into real and imaginary part?
[00:12:23] <willcode4[m]> The floats are the real and imaginary parts.
[00:12:23] <blue94[m]> ah every single float?
[00:12:58] <blue94[m]> No way, I am not aware of a way to write that
[00:13:17] <blue94[m]> My guess is that half of the floats will be imaginary parts
[00:13:23] <willcode4[m]> In GR, complex is alternating float32 I, float32 Q.
[00:13:24] <blue94[m]> but the question is which ones?
[00:13:30] <blue94[m]> willcode4[m]: SWEET
[00:13:32] <blue94[m]> THANKS <3
[00:13:52] <willcode4[m]> The purple ones are I and the green ones are Q üòÄ
[00:14:11] <blue94[m]> omg wish I had the library to make waterfall plots
[00:14:14] <blue94[m]> but they are so expensive
[00:14:29] <blue94[m]> Perhaps I will make it in Unity, now that would be some combination that hasn't happened before
[00:15:48] <willcode4[m]> I don't think you need another coffee.
[00:18:48] <willcode4[m]> Apparently some are very expensive: https://www.ebay.com/itm/353403771420?hash=item5248819a1c:g:ZxgAAOSw~S5geRBE ... try the free ones.
[00:26:00] <blue94[m]> Why?
[00:26:02] <blue94[m]> Waterfall plots are so popular?
[00:26:11] <blue94[m]> I wonder what the commercial applications are

[01:55:36] <blue94[m]> Nono, this is the output from GR, I capture the entire packet and try to plot it
[01:55:51] <blue94[m]> The packet is a float array in this case
[01:56:15] <blue94[m]> But GR is capable of getting beautiful timeseries and a foruier transform but I get this forest of super weird peaks. 
[01:56:24] <blue94[m]> So I guess there is some clever peak processing under the hood?
[01:56:46] <Yamakaja[m]> No, what exactly are you doing?
[01:57:08] <Yamakaja[m]> I have no idea what you mean with "I capture the entire packet and try to plot it"
[01:57:22] <Yamakaja[m]> Do you have a flowgraph?
[01:57:30] <Yamakaja[m]> Are you using external software for this?
[01:57:56] <Yamakaja[m]> How are the samples getting to the lower plot, and how are they getting to the top plot
[01:59:17] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Bottom plot is GRC time sink. I send the packet with ZMQ sink, capture it in external program. The packet if actually a long list of floats - around 3k. Top graph is a plot of these floats in arbitrary range with equal distance between them. 
[02:00:01] <Yamakaja[m]> Okay, so what data are you piping into your ZMQ sink, how are you receiving that data and how are you reconstructing that into floats?
[02:00:03] <blue94[m]>  But I wanna have identical plot to the one in GRC
[02:00:23] <Yamakaja[m]> Well i got that ...
[02:00:35] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Oh you are right. I should check whether I reconstruct it correctly. 
[02:00:41] <blue94[m]> I have few lines of code to do that

[02:02:13] <Yamakaja[m]> I'm no C# expert, but are you really first converting them to double and then casting to float? ...
[02:02:22] <Yamakaja[m]> Doubles have 8 bytes, floats 4
[02:02:41] <Yamakaja[m]> If you're reading eight bytes and using that to construct a single number, you'll get weird stuff

[02:04:14] <blue94[m]> But you're right I'll stick to float

[02:04:34] <blue94[m]> Anynymous function
[02:04:40] <blue94[m]> This is lambda expression in c#

[06:15:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> flash: It depends very much on your definition of "real time".  
[06:15:31] <patchvonbraun[m]> The problem with SDR is that there's no way to "turn the universe off while you catch up".  That is a MUCH more stringent real-time constraint than processing packet flows.
[06:15:35] <flash[m]> sure; that comment is from wireshark, in the context of network packet dissectino
[06:15:47] <flash[m]> s/dissectino/dissection/
[06:17:23] <flash[m]> to your point ... if Lua isn't suitable to real-time network traffic analysis, and SDR is even more stringent, then ...
[06:19:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> Agreed.
[06:21:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> Although I don't tend to think of Wireshark as anything other than a kind of quick snooping tool. I wouldn't necessarily use it for doing DPI-driven policy-based routing, for example.  But I haven't looked at its guts for many years now...
[06:33:13] <muaddib[m]> So I‚Äôm curious what the use case is for lua-radio over regular Python for embedded systems. Just the size that it takes up?

[06:50:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> The whole "it has a smaller binary footprint" these days is a bit of a red herring.  Even on cheap embedded systems like rPis, the "system disk" (as an uSD or eMMC card) can be totally-frikken-huge given the "embedded system" context.
[06:50:16] <muaddib[m]> Yea, that‚Äôs kinda what I was thinking.
[06:50:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> LuaRadio only achieves "real time" performance when using LuaJit *AND* VOLK and FFTW and liquid-dsp, which are all aggressively-optimized compiled code.  
[06:50:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> What i don't know is what the data-marshalling costs are in Lua compared to Python.
[06:51:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's one of the reasons that you can't expect a Python-based "work" function to perform super-fast even when using strongly-optimized underlying components like numpy/fftw/etc
[06:52:33] <muaddib[m]> That totally makes sense.
[06:53:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> The "I don't want all that bloat" argument is also levelled against Gnu Radio, and it's fair if you're having to recompile it all the time.  But you mostly don't have to with distros packaging more-recent versions.  And the "but, but, but, I'll NEVER use any of the OFDM demodulators, why should I tolerate them spinning on my disk?" is just silly in a world where terabyte drives are common and relatively cheap.
[06:55:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> The whole "no hard external dependencies" thing is also nonsense.  Any application runs on an operating system, which, I gotta say, is the limiting case of "hard external dependency".  
[06:55:46] <muaddib[m]> Yea, I mean. I ran an APRS transceiver with a B205 on a freaking RPI2 using GNURadio.
[06:56:31] <patchvonbraun[m]> Folks who want rich and exotic functionality, but don't want to the software package to depend on anything else, AND want that package to have regular updates AND want it to be free are delusional.
[06:58:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> Science and engineering have been built on a long and proud tradition of "standing on the shoulders of giants".  But in the software realm, that's often seen as a weakness.  "why does your software depend on other software? That's lame."
[06:59:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> Don't get me wrong, LuaRadio is kinda cool in a way.  But I think its requirements were driven from some fundamental wrong-headedness.  IMHO, obviously.
[07:00:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> And by a fear of C++ :)
[07:06:51] <muaddib[m]> hah. like i said, i really haven't seen a unique use for it. My friend did a project in it just cause he thought it looked neat, which i respect way more than any argument of codebase superiority or a pinnacle of linux library genius. 
[07:06:58] <muaddib[m]> s/a//
[07:09:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> It does look neat and there are probably some good "nuggets" of ideas in there.    One of the criticisms is that rapid-iteration with GR OOT C++ modules is a pain--but that's because compiled languages like C++ are a pain in general in this regard, and that has very little to do with GR.
[07:11:35] <muaddib[m]> yea, i agree. i learned what C++ i know from using GR cause it gave me a direction. I also learned about optimization and using good computer science that way, not just syntax.
[07:12:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> Bjarne heard that there was a fire-sale on at the syntax store, and bought all of it :)
[07:16:51] <Hash[m]> Haha
[07:18:13] <Hash[m]> I went through the entire learncpp website for fun to apply to writing GNURadio blocks. Asm/C/C++ are enjoyable the more you learn
[07:24:44] <muaddib[m]> i'm with you on the second 2, the first one not so much :D
[07:26:13] <Hash[m]> I liked programming PIC microcontrollers in C/ASM
[07:26:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> Back in the day, there were these really nice macro assemblers for many different CPUs.  They actually made coding in ASM kinda nice.  But these days, ASM is relegated to "if you really must" type applications, and so they're kind of minimalist.
[07:28:28] <muaddib[m]> the thing with C++ is you REALLY have to understand some of the concepts that i'm not really good with like overloading functions and to my detriment even some of fundamental tricks with Obj Oriented languages. 
[07:28:28] <muaddib[m]> Open up the SRSLTE source code and try to follow what's going on with an ide. It's not impossible, but man. There's a BUNCH of state changes cause of the application, so its even more confusing.
[07:30:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> I always thought that operator-overloading was a double-edged sword.  Increases apparent expressiveness in the language, but increases confusion.

[21:02:59] <blue94[m]> Any1 knows how IFT of forest of frequencies would look like? 
[21:03:08] <blue94[m]> How its called?
[21:03:19] <blue94[m]> I dont have matlab :C
[21:03:55] <Yamakaja[m]> You mean IFFT? And a rect results in a sinc
[21:04:06] <Yamakaja[m]> Also you don't need matlab. You can use Octave or just embrace the python ecosystem
[21:04:39] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: yes ifft would be better than ift
[21:04:46] <Yamakaja[m]> Actually, are you referring to the true Inverse Fourier Transform?
[21:05:23] <Yamakaja[m]> And what is the goal of this exercise? Do you just want to learn more about signal processing, or did you have a specific application in mind? :P
[21:07:28] <willcode4[m]> A translated square in f domain would be a sinc t * exp(jwt) or something like that, wouldn't it? Lots of resources on intro to DSP and Fourier online.
[21:08:01] <Yamakaja[m]> t_0 not t, but yes

[21:15:09] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, there are some scaling factors missing, but the general functions are correct i guess
[21:15:56] <Yamakaja[m]> blue94: btw, what did you mean with "forest of frequencies"?
[21:17:13] <Yamakaja[m]> Were you maybe referring to dirac combs (In the context of the discrete fourier transform)?

[21:36:29] <muaddib[m]> This sound like the Duality Property/Fourier relationships.

[21:42:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> Fake AD chip sounds pretty implausible.  Even the "counterfeit" B2xx that are on the market (and vailable for only a little less than the real thing) use genuine AD936x chips.
[21:42:41] <mspears-VE3AGS[m> yes but I have having a massive time with these. In order to save some money I got a couple off amazon and with the exact same software that I am running with my legit Ettus B210 I get this Error: EnvironmentError: IOError: load_fpga: cannot write bitstream to FX3 (-1: LIBUSB_ERROR_CODE -1). 
[21:43:02] <mspears-VE3AGS[m> I just cannot fathom why
[21:43:11] <Hoernchen> hardly related to the adi chip
[21:43:18] <Hoernchen> sounds like broken usb..
[21:43:26] <mspears-VE3AGS[m> ok thanks
[21:43:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> The FX3 is a Cypress chip--it's the USB "data pump"
[21:43:27] <Hoernchen> shitty soldering?
[21:43:29] <muaddib[m]> Yea, that‚Äôs not a fake chip, that‚Äôs a knockoff B210
[21:44:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> mspears - VE3AGS: What does "lsusb" report when you plug it in?
[21:44:13] <Yamakaja[m]> Maybe they stole the AD936x off of a pluto? :D

[21:46:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> May also be power-sag--have you tried with external power supply?   
[21:46:08] <muaddib[m]> Yamakaja[m]: That‚Äôs a great thought! Aren‚Äôt the chips on the Plutos like a first round fail chip? Or are they an actual different rev?

[21:47:27] <Yamakaja[m]> muaddib:  ADI has some wiki articles on how you can unlock 2x2 / full bandwidth operation, so the chips on the pluto certainly support it ^^
[21:48:24] <muaddib[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I‚Äôm thinking about getting one, but I‚Äôve already got too many projects as it is. 
[21:49:33] <Yamakaja[m]> muaddib: The pluto is a bit special in that you can't stream the full BW to your PC, so even if it can receive and process lots of data locally (Or can't, it's a Z7010 after all), the USB 2.0 link is quite limiting
[21:49:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> The "clones" are a clone of a very-early rev of the B210, which was done when USB3 was still quite young, and there's a current-programming resistor that had to be tweaked in later revs to make it work with more USB3 hubs.
[21:50:12] <muaddib[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Yea, my focus would be putting a simple application on the board.

[21:50:24] <Yamakaja[m]> Fair enough, that should work
[21:50:47] <Yamakaja[m]> If you want to be really fancy you might be able to put some extra logic in the FPGA fabric, but there's also not much space left there
[21:51:51] <muaddib[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Yea, I learned my limits with RFNoC recently. 
[21:52:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> There are folks attemping RFNOC stuff who are neither FPGA nor software people.   They are shocked that "it's so hard".
[21:53:09] <Yamakaja[m]> Lol
[21:53:36] <Yamakaja[m]> i think i'm an ok software engineer, but FPGAs are a quite different beast alltogether ...
[21:54:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: My problem is that my entire head-space has been shaped and pummelled by 40 years of being a software geek.  FPGA "code" *looks* like garden-variety software.  It aint.
[22:10:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> So LIBUSB_ERROR_CODE -1 is "I/O error".  Which means something bad happened during a bulk transfer.  Bad cable.  Bad connector.  Bad power supply.  Bad FX3.
