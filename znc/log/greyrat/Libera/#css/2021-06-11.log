[01:36:32] <hoppity> Hi everyone, I am seeing that my web app looks great when using the "mobile view" on chrome and firefox's developer tools but looks terrible when actually viewed on an iPhone or Android device. Can I ask for your kind suggestion on what to do in this case?
[01:39:12] <[twisti]> fix what looks incorrect until everything looks the way you want
[01:40:24] <hoppity> [twisti], oh thanks, how did I not think of that
[01:41:07] <[twisti]> :D
[01:41:29] <[twisti]> theres no magical 'fix all my problems the way i want them fixed' button, stuff looks different in different browsers :(
[01:43:51] <hoppity> I guess my concern is that the developer tools cannot be trusted.
[01:44:07] <hoppity> And I was wondering if there is any way to make them be for faithful
[01:44:34] <FunkyBob> that's... not really dev tools fault
[01:44:46] <FunkyBob> that's "my site looks different in othe browsers"
[01:46:23] <hoppity> FunkyBob, so the dev tools in Iphone 6/7/8 mode looks good but when you actually use a physical iPhone 6/7/8 the site loosk completely different is not the dev tools fault?
[01:47:44] <FunkyBob> iphone mode in firefox?  it's more likely "iphone size" than actual mode
[01:48:01] <FunkyBob> you're using totally different browsers, with totally different rendering engines
[01:48:54] <hoppity> No, I am on Firefox and Chrome (PC) using the dev tools where you can test how your site would look on a mobile device and it literally says which phone it is simulating. However once you actually grab said phone it does not look on the phone like the dev tools said it would. If that makes sense.
[01:49:21] <FunkyBob> well in my chromium it lists a bunch of phones, but nothing says it's "emulating" them
[01:49:50] <hoppity> Emulating size-wise... geez
[01:50:05] <FunkyBob> yes, it's a bunch of pre-set screen sizes/resolutions
[01:50:06] <hoppity> Not literally an emulator like a NES emulator
[01:50:14] <FunkyBob> well, choose your words carefully
[01:50:28] <hoppity> or maybe not try to purposely misunderstand
[01:50:37] <FunkyBob> so you agree it's not trying to emulate the browser on that phone... but you're surprised totally different browses behave differently?
[01:50:54] <FunkyBob> especially when the ipone browsers will be using safaris render engine which is notoriously.... unique
[01:51:08] <FunkyBob> I'm not purposely misunderstanding... I'm taking you at your word
[01:51:47] <FunkyBob> but given my experiecces helping people, I totally believe someone would think that switch would try to emulate the browser behavior from a different device
[01:51:51] <hoppity> I'm you.. "You are taking me?" "Where are you taking me?"
[01:52:04] <hoppity> You want to get retardedly literal
[01:52:09] <hoppity> anyway.. thanks

[02:05:42] <AndreYuhai> Moreover I couldn't understand why there's horizontal overflow
[02:06:38] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: ùake sure you set margin:0 on the body
[02:06:50] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: to get rid of scrolls
[02:07:39] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, I did but there's still that horizontal scroll
[02:08:52] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: do overflow:hidden on the html element
[02:09:03] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: and margin:0;overflow:auto; on the body
[02:09:50] <hassoon> that's sass ? meh
[02:10:47] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: e.G https://codepen.io/hassoon/pen/XWMPGaj
[02:11:45] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, Thank you! How would I center those cards?
[02:14:14] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: #card-slider is absolute-positioned, and so are its children, but they have the same 530px width, so you need first to set its width to 530px as a first step
[02:15:15] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, #card-slider's width to 530px, right?
[02:15:31] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: yep
[02:15:59] *** Joins: ______GOD______ (~GOD@189.174.198.176)
[02:16:18] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: then since it's absolutely positioned, you can center it by doing left: 50%:transform: translateX(-50%);
[02:16:31] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: anyway it's there https://codepen.io/hassoon/pen/XWMPGaj
[02:17:03] <hassoon> mmmmmm, maybe i'll add css preprocessors support to MyFiddle, why not..

[02:20:45] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, That would be nice but I am don't wanna be too much. I really gotta learn CSS/HTML. :D Most of it is alien to me right now. :D
[02:21:10] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: alright, have fun
[02:22:21] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, is there any source, book etc. you would recommend for learning CSS?
[02:23:10] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: best way to learn code is by pratically doing it in tutorials
[02:23:25] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: start here https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn
[02:23:33] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, thank you!
[02:23:34] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: start the Responsive Web Design course
[02:23:50] <entuland> and MDN as reference
[02:24:24] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: it covers most basic css techniques, and offers easy to understant tutorials that you just need to follow and write code accordingly

[16:14:24] <dev4449> hi. good day.
[16:33:24] <dev4449> The place I'm learning css from says: "When multiple elements float, the rendering engine fills up the width of the browser window as it places the HTML elements in order in the markup. When there’s no place for the next element, a new line is started.". Now please consider this jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/npLb8zyh/ why doesn't the last
[16:33:24] <dev4449> rounded div float to right?
[16:33:59] <dev4449> When I make the window smaller, I've taken a screenshot of the result:
[16:34:04] <dev4449> https://imgur.com/l8oRcza.png
[16:34:51] <dev4449> when I make the window smaller, the last rounded div doesn't float to right. It's evident in the screenshot.
[16:39:16] *** Quits: especial (~especial@cm-84.214.207.74.getinternet.no) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:47:56] <entuland> don't use floats for that kind of layout, dev4449
[16:48:11] <entuland> floats should be used to float images in a paragraph of text or the alike
[16:48:21] <entuland> use grid or flex or columns techniques
[16:48:59] <entuland> also, what's the reference you are using?
[16:49:08] <dev4449> entuland: educative.io
[16:49:09] <entuland> there is plenty of good and bad places around to learn CSS from
[16:49:25] <entuland> I don't know that source
[16:49:36] <dev4449> I'm failing to understand this section
[16:49:57] <entuland> this should be one of your main references: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
[16:50:17] <entuland> as for that specific source you're reading, can you provide a link to that actual page?
[16:50:59] <entuland> by the way, your fiddle seems completely empty
[16:51:19] <dev4449> I wish I could, but it requires paid membership. please take a look at it's main page: www.educative.io
[16:51:40] <entuland> I can't tell what you're seeing if it's behind a paywall
[16:52:12] <entuland> try fixing the fiddle first and I can try help understanding the behavior
[16:52:45] <entuland> although I think it's just matter of the normal behavior of floats, which are a mess for that kind of layout in your screenshot
[16:53:00] <entuland> as I mentioned, you shouldn't be using floats to arrange boxes around like that
[16:53:19] <entuland> that's a very old technique with plenty of headaches hiding in plain sight
[16:53:31] <entuland> modern techniques involve using flex, grid and columns
[16:53:59] <dev4449> entuland: I see
[16:54:06] <dev4449> entuland: this is the correct fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/npLb8zyh/1/
[16:54:33] <entuland> yep, seems normal behavior for floats
[16:55:00] <entuland> the round leftmost box will not clear the line because the square ones aren't pushing it down enough
[16:55:10] <entuland> that's the kind of headaches floats give
[16:56:04] <entuland> as you can see from the behavior making the viewport very narrow, the final result also depends on the order of your markup
[16:56:26] <entuland> with a grid layout for example you're free to place stuff around regardless of where it lies in the markup order
[16:57:03] <dev4449> hmmm.
[16:57:22] <dev4449> okay. thanks for taking the time.
[16:57:42] <entuland> yw - see this small variant, only added the numbers to tell boxes apart: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/mkwynL06/
[16:59:52] <dev4449> entuland: okay. I think I'm gonna do a little more research on floats. I think this knowledge is enough for now. I'll continue to reach the upcoming chapters on flexbox and grid.
[17:01:41] <dev4449> I actually hope this knowledge be enough so I can move on

[21:58:37] <fweht> i try to create custom controls for a video player, should i try to get a `<button/>` element to look like i want or can i just go with an `<img/>` and `onclick`?
[22:01:06] <entuland> you can style the heck out of pretty much any element, so that doesn't make a big difference
[22:01:48] <entuland> probably better to use a button anyways, due to the purpose of the element
[22:02:09] <fweht> entuland: yeah, i assumed that somehow, thanks!
