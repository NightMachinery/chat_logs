[02:45:21] <audiobirb> am i stupid for thinking about using bootstrap tabs to simulate an SPA experience with vanilla js and jquery (and obviously bootstrap)?
[02:46:13] <ljharb> audiobirb: not stupid, but that doesn't sound like the right way to do anything
[02:46:29] <ljharb> audiobirb: use a server-rendered react app, and use something like react-router so you can get the client navigation as well
[02:47:16] <audiobirb> ljharb, i dont know react and i loath webpack
[02:47:44] <ljharb> audiobirb: then learn it, and bundlers are required for modern web dev. you don't have to use webpack if you don't want to.
[02:47:59] <ljharb> audiobirb: bootstrap and jquery are easily a half decade obsolete
[02:48:41] <audiobirb> ljharb, how much will people look down on me if i decide to go the bootstrap/jquery way if my project gets a lot of traction

[02:56:13] <audiobirb> ljharb, it's not a basic website, but the SPA portion will be generally straightforward, with 3-5 "tabs". it's a music service
[02:56:29] <audiobirb> the SPA portion is the music discovery portion, like pandora
[02:57:12] <audiobirb> there's a SPA page for the main part that plays music, one for artist pages, and one for search. there may be more added later
[02:57:57] <pulse> React is slow and JSX is an abomination. I'd rather code my apps using crochet patterns and a punch-card processor.
[02:58:03] <ljharb> react is super fast, and jsx is great
[02:58:15] <audiobirb> facebook's ui is...meh
[02:58:16] <ljharb> audiobirb: good luck. i've had a music startup before
[02:58:23] <ljharb> audiobirb: yes that's true, but that's got nothing to do with react
[02:58:36] <audiobirb> ljharb, facebook _created_ react
[02:58:38] <pulse> "Super fast" can't hear you over waiting this simple hello world to load for over 10 seconds
[02:58:52] <ljharb> audiobirb: so?
[02:58:57] <audiobirb> whatevs
[02:59:02] <audiobirb> ljharb, howd your music startup go?
[02:59:12] <ljharb> audiobirb: the quality of their UI is based on their designers, not the framework
[02:59:15] <audiobirb> and thanks for the good luck wish
[02:59:41] <ljharb> audiobirb: lol "fine" i guess, it never failed but also never succeeded. but it can take years to go from nothing to a working service, totally separate from the business model and legal issues
[03:00:22] <audiobirb> ljharb, what legal issues did you run into? i'm solving license/copyright problems by having a similar legal structure as soundcloud. it's an indie music service
[03:00:41] <audiobirb> artists, by uploading their work to the platform, give over certain rights
[03:01:02] <audiobirb> and there is a huge incentive for big artists to upload their music to the platform as well
[03:01:09] <ljharb> right but the artists willing to do that aren't artists anyone wants to hear, except for the ones already using soundcloud

[03:01:32] <audiobirb> ljharb, my payout scheme is novel and attractive

[03:02:25] <audiobirb> ljharb, well the value will come after people start using it obviously
[03:03:29] <audiobirb> ljharb, one feature of the site is music recognition. users input songs, app spits out "your song is 53% like queen, 23% like led zeppelin, 3% llike kanye west"

[03:04:42] <ljharb> and, if you try to make those agreements, record labels will let you do the research for them and then find a cheaper way to do it :-)
[03:05:03] <ljharb> if the gimmick is the ML models, then try to sell it to spotify or soundcloud or something

[04:32:16] <xochilpili> hello everyone
[04:32:33] <xochilpili> Im using inversify, im creating a ContainerModule with class Library1 , then over inversify.config.ts file, i have load that module, and in my class Test i have injected that Library1 using @inject(Types.Library1) private library: Library1). Now, im trying to use jest to do proper testings, but i want to rebind that Library1 and replaced with a mock and then injected to Test class. Is this possible ?

[04:34:00] <xochilpili> so far i have done something like this: const myTest = myContainer.get<Types.MyTest>(Test); < that loads Library1 correctly. But then i wanted to myContainer.rebind<Types.Library1>(Library1).toConstantValue(mockLibrary) <
[04:35:05] <xochilpili> but got TypeError: Function has non-object prototype 'undefined' in instanceof check
[04:35:18] <xochilpili> seems like, Test1 is not property loaded.

[11:55:16] <daedeloth> i've made a quiz app that uses user generated content, and some users have figured out they can use emoji's in the questions
[11:55:42] <daedeloth> and some non-windows users started using flag emoji's, which are not supported in windows
[11:56:14] <daedeloth> so now i'm looking for a way to intead provide my own emoji's (with 'my own' meaning that i want to find a project that has all emojis and use those instead)
[11:56:35] <daedeloth> does anyone have any tips on what set to use / what strategy to use?
[11:56:41] <Cork> deadbeat: webfonts would solve most of those problems (is not all)
[11:56:52] <Cork> *if not
[11:56:56] <daedeloth> i don't think that is true
[11:57:17] <Cork> sure, cause if the font doesn't support the emoji no one can use it
[11:57:20] <daedeloth> from what I read there is no support for 'colored fonts' in most browsers
[11:57:26] <Cork> and if it does all will see it
[11:57:44] <Cork> all blink and gecko browsers do
[11:58:03] <Cork> so newest edge, all chrome, vivaldi and firefox
[11:58:11] <Cork> (and more)
[11:58:39] <daedeloth> hm so i could use noto-emoji and fallback to default for safari
[11:58:42] <Cork> there are none color versions in the fonts too so as long as it supports emoji you at least get those
[11:59:00] <Cork> not saying safari doesn't support it, just don't know there
[12:00:02] <daedeloth> hm I think that could work yes
[12:00:33] <daedeloth> I'll have to figure out a way to change font in the middle of a canvas drawText call but I guess I can do some magic with invisible characters

[12:10:06] <daedeloth> that seems to be less straight forward than I hoped. Was hoping to be able to use some whitespace / invisible character that is about the width of an emoji and then use a second text with noto-emoji font to draw the emoji on top of the whitespace
[12:10:28] <daedeloth> but from what I find there are no suitable whitespace characters that could be used for such a thing

[21:42:26] <jaawerth> it's not a big so much as just how the api was designed - sent is just a way to not get that behavior when you don't want it (which is often the case). it's because the generator starts "paused", without any yield being performed. I would just call it generatorWrap or something
[21:42:44] <ljharb> that the generator starts "paused" imo is a massive design flaw
[21:43:03] <ljharb> it's insanely easy to get a pause if you want one, it's impossible to not get one if you don't, so obviously it shouldn't have had one

[21:50:10] <jaawerth> if JS had multiple returns you could let the first .next() pass its args to the generator function and subsequent .next()'s pass args through yield, like lua does. but then, multiple returns creates its own set of confusing situations
[21:50:59] <Decker> return [{err:true,op:flase},{err:true}]   - how many returns you want?

[21:57:35] <earendel> sounds more of a reducer, or actually a sequence. when u need the result of the previous function, that's a classic recusion?
[22:00:31] <jaawerth> yeah, it's not unheard of to use generators (or iterators that aren't necessarily backed by generators) to implement lazy recursive patterns
[22:00:56] <earendel> hehe.

[22:08:19] <jaawerth> also reduce is just a flat abstraction of (acc, x, ....xs) recursion so I do kind of think of them interchangeably tbh

[23:08:05] <jaawerth> ljharb: you ever seen this? I was recently shocked to come across a bunch of projects using this "standard" module as a zero-config eslint, yet also not enforcing `'use strict';` inside commonjs modules... I was surprised by how easily it was dismissed  https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1440
[23:09:19] <ljharb> jaawerth: i mean, the response is reasonable - the airbnb config doesn't enforce it either
[23:09:28] <ljharb> jaawerth: the airbnb config assumes/requires you're using babel and authoring ESM
[23:09:31] <jaawerth> yeah but you have to configure what kind of module it is in eslint
[23:09:41] <jaawerth> and airbnb yells at you for not using ES modules, doesn't it?
[23:09:45] <ljharb> no
[23:09:53] <ljharb> it can't, for the reasons mentioned in that issue

[23:15:07] <jaawerth> anyway, it turns out many of the top jsonpointer modules in npm (and at least half of the ones listed on http://jsonpatch.com/#javascript are both omitting it and don't appear to have a build step that would inject it, I was kind of horrified
[23:16:27] <ljharb> what is jsonpointer
[23:19:30] <jaawerth> it's an RFC for what it sounds like, basically a JSON descriptor for delving into an object/json document
[23:19:46] <jaawerth> goes along with the jsonpatch rfc
[23:20:33] <jaawerth> ah actually that same site has it and links to the spec draft so you get the tldr version AND the spec version in one go http://jsonpatch.com/#json-pointer
[23:21:28] <jaawerth> I work on a project that does a lot of jsonschema stuff on large scale so I'm pushing for APIs that ALSO use some sort of standards so we can keep the logic as portable and interopable as possible
[23:22:01] <qswz> you use ajv I guess
[23:22:12] *** Joins: Harlin (~DonQixote@c-24-128-8-53.hsd1.co.comcast.net)
[23:22:50] <jaawerth> portable as in across platforms - but many of the jsonschema implementations are also able to provide validations that include jsonpointer etc. but this also includes apis for doing things like diffing and updating schemas, since part of the project is a UI for managing them
[23:22:57] <jaawerth> but yes, the js-based parts do use ajv
[23:23:35] <qswz> json pointer is for modifying operation on json?
[23:23:44] <jaawerth> jsonpatch is, jsonpointer is just related
[23:23:49] <qswz> ok
[23:24:55] <jaawerth> basically if the backend API runs the validation, I'm pushing to have it provide the validation errors with jsonpointers so any clients can easily get a direct reference to the offending piece of data in context
[23:25:06] <jaawerth> particularly since this is an events API that batches events
