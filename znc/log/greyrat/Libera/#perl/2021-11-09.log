[00:02:58] <mst> jaytee80: Throwable absolutely is a role, I bet something in your code is doing 'no Moo::sification;' and breaking everything
[00:03:26] <mst> Throwable is a Moo::Role which auto-inflates to a Moose::Role ... unless you deliberately turn that feature off
[00:03:56] <jaytee80> I'll grep, but by memory I've never used no Moo::sification
[00:04:49] <jaytee80> Grep shows nothing for Moo.
[00:05:00] <mst> you could also test it in isolation with: perl -Moose -e 'with "Throwable"'
[00:05:37] <jaytee80> You can only consume roles, Throwable is not a Moose role at /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/Moose/Exporter.pm line 419
[00:05:38] <jaytee80>         Moose::with('Throwable') called at -e line 1
[00:05:50] <mst> then something is going very wrong.
[00:06:23] <mst> somehow your Moose+Moo+Throwable setup is broken
[00:07:09] <jaytee80> I think some things didn't get resolved properly on dnf because I had powertools off. Before I realized that I'd filled in the deps with cpantorpm
[00:07:38] <jaytee80> I'll try and go back and get everything installed off dnf repos for moose moo throwable
[00:08:11] <mst> I have literally never seen that break before without somebody deliberately turning it off
[00:08:35] <jaytee80> I'm special?
[00:09:09] <mst> and the code that's not running here is something I -wrote- so I'm kinda unhappy because damnit this wasn't supposed to be even possible to break that way

[00:14:09] <mst> jaytee80: remember 'things built using Moo work with Moo and Moose', that was kinda part of the point of Moo
[00:14:28] <alh> I'm surprised that's the error! Probably just no one's made it more friendly
[00:14:31] <mst> because "you can make your non ->meta using code way lighter without breaking anything" matters
[00:15:13] <jaytee80> dnf's perl-Throwable seems to have resolved this issue.
[00:15:27] <jaytee80> the -MMoose -e 'with "Throwable"' has no output now.
[00:15:32] <mst> right, so it wasn't weird, the error message was just dumb

[00:15:49] <jaytee80> thank you very much, sir!
[00:17:13] <jaytee80> Would it be a better practice in my code to 'use Throwable' before with('Throwable')? That would cause RPM to detect the dependency at least.

[00:23:00] <jaytee80> I guess. I could just put the dep directly in the RPM spec file and leave my code pretty. But then it's on me to manually catch all instances of this type of thing.

[00:33:55] <daemon> mst, ok so I decided to spend the night tapping up some new templates for rust and perl for my self, for the perl one; 1) Create the project directory 2) git init 3) deploy gitignore 4) carton/plx init (from external binary - lib::local standard) 5) docker files, vsworkspace, readme.md, make.sh 6) initial git commit, with all the past steps + gitignores. Sound about sane?
[00:34:03] <jaytee8011> don't prefer postfix becuase there's multiple lines in the error handle block.
[00:34:21] <mst> the other thing you could do is
[00:34:28] <mst> open(my $fh, ...) or do { ... };

[01:39:22] <gordonfish> [Path::Tiny] I noticed something interesting on win32. Say I'm in pwd C:\qux, and run this: $p = path qw( C: foo bar ); print $p; I get C:/qux/foo/bar. The 'C:' is replaced with the CWD, which is sometimes a win/dos-ism in some places iirc, but still seems a little odd here.
[01:40:06] <gordonfish> (If I have 'C:/' instad of 'C:' I get C:/foo/bar as expected.)
[01:42:32] <gordonfish> I'm wondering if that behavior is right? I don't think I'd call it a bug, but it was kind of confusing at first before I released the missing slash after C:
[01:42:38] <revhippie> that kind of makes sense.  anywhere else "x:" w/o a backslash means "the current directory on drive x:".
[01:44:24] <gordonfish> Right, on the command line, but I don't believe I've seen that behavior with paths outside of that (like in programs, conf files, etc.)
[01:44:39] <xenu> this behavior exists on the api level, it isn't just shell
[01:44:58] <xenu> open() etc do that too
[01:45:56] <gordonfish> Hmm, I guess it's something I haven't observed too often, as it's harder to miss that (back)slash when it's a whole string instead of a list of components like I had.
[01:47:01] <revhippie> oh, it's even documented to behave that way -- https://metacpan.org/pod/Path%3A%3ATiny#path (4th paragraph after code sample)
[01:47:38] <gordonfish> Ah
[01:47:51] <revhippie> although I'd've probably read "path component" as qw( C: foo bar ) like you had.  Could be clearer, maybe.

[01:49:22] <lembron> hi, what do i need/is blocking me from passing a regex into opt_i here: https://github.com/apcro/check_munin_rrd/blob/master/check_munin_rrd.pl#L132 -- to my understanding this "smart match" should allow for it, but i guess its a "string not a regex" or so from GetOptions()?
[01:49:26] <gordonfish> revhippie: It says 'On Windows, if the path consists of a drive identifier without a path component', though technically I had a 'path component', so I'm not sure if that's a bug or if the documentation should be updated to say 'per argument' or similar.
[01:51:14] <revhippie> gordonfish: i'd say those docs could probably be tweaked a bit.

[01:51:48] <gordonfish> Oh, it's not even per argument, as I get the same thing with path qw( 'C:foo/bar' ); so the documenation differs from the behavior.
[01:53:04] <revhippie> eval: @foo = map { qr/$_/ } 'foo.bar', 'stuf+', '^pop\d{3,5}$'; \@foo
[01:53:06] <perlbot> revhippie: [qr/foo.bar/u,qr/stuf+/u,qr/^pop\d{3,5}$/u]
[01:53:24] <revhippie> lembron: you could make regexes out of them that way
[01:53:37] <gordonfish> Since the docs clear say it should only do that that when it's 'without a path component', then I'd say that constitutes a bug.
[01:53:40] <gordonfish> clearly

[13:40:57] <Altreus> er hmm
[13:41:09] <Altreus> is that the same one or is there a new one that's better?
[13:41:32] <lopid> perlbot says core
[13:41:32] <perlbot> lopid: No factoid found. Did you mean one of these: [slackware] [spicer] [suggest] [searchurl] [shangrila] [accessors] [hashsort] [sql server] [says what] [speak-arabic]

[13:52:18] <lopid> i hope not
[13:54:14] <Altreus> I'm no expert on the language so I wondered if it were some edge case - as far as I remember, single quotes are used for chars, aren't they? and double quotes construct strings

[13:59:34] <choroba> qc() would be nice for constants
[13:59:34] <Altreus> or whatever it is
[14:00:00] <Altreus> choroba: q() already creates a constant - it's the variable it's in that can be changed!
[14:00:32] <choroba> Yes, I was just joking.
[14:00:35] <Altreus> o
[14:00:42] <Altreus> then: hoho!
[14:01:25] <choroba> not sure I feel better :/
[14:02:28] <choroba> the problem with constants is they mean several different things
[14:02:47] <choroba> the core pragma enables compile time inlining
[14:03:11] <choroba> Readonly locks a variable so that it can't be changed
[14:04:22] <Altreus> the inlining sounds like an optimisation that you can make as a result of constness
[14:04:58] <Altreus> not changeable is the thing the high-level code is asking for
[14:05:09] <Altreus> quite what it is that is unchangeable seems to be up for debate
[14:05:21] <Altreus> This is what I had in mind when I said C++ style

[23:36:37] <gordonfish> I don't use prototypes hardly at all (other than to occasionally make map/grep style subs that take a block), so I'm likely just not remembering something about that, but at the same time I can remember my example eval working a long time ago.
