[00:01:37] <FunkyBob> i prefer a single file
[00:02:04] <FunkyBob> django natively supports multiple, but I find that makes it too easy for values to get out of sync
[00:03:05] <FunkyBob> alternatively, a non-django specific env config solution https://github.com/funkybob/confucius
[00:03:21] <blackleitus> okay . lets say I keep a single file with env , but how do I move from dev to prod or handle requeriments prod - dev across a single code base?
[00:04:07] <FunkyBob> not sure what problems you envisage

[00:05:19] <FunkyBob> typically  your config defaults to values suitable for dev...
[00:05:24] <FunkyBob> prod sets thos envs to override
[00:05:34] <FunkyBob> as for requirements... do you mean packages?
[00:06:17] *** Quits: theprophet (~theprophe@85.114.228.184) (Client Quit)
[00:06:54] <blackleitus> yeah
[00:07:15] <blackleitus> packages, nginx configs, dockerfiles ,
[00:09:15] <FunkyBob> python deps by setup.py or requirements.txt, or pyproject.toml if you're up to that
[00:09:23] <FunkyBob> the r est... wherever y ou like
[00:10:22] <blackleitus> so basically. I need two files of every infrastructure setthings like nginx, apache, packages , etc etc
[00:10:40] <blackleitus> of course sync with a single codebase
[00:12:33] <FunkyBob> firstly... why would you have apache _and_ nginx?
[00:12:51] <FunkyBob> secondly... if you're using docker... why would those files change between envs?
[00:13:39] <blackleitus> example there are some docker files that uses aws as db and dev in local docker db
[00:13:54] <blackleitus> we need two files without deploying all services

[00:18:03] <LordKalma> if you're using docker, just use .env files?!
[00:18:31] <LordKalma> I have a dev.env and a prod.sample.env (not going to push my prod env file, of course, but I want to keep the schema in hand :p)
[00:18:55] <LordKalma> https://github.com/ruilvo/radioamadorismo-website/blob/master/dev.env#L4
[00:20:47] <wallbroken> https://imgur.com/nbYKVIR
[00:20:58] <wallbroken> this is so true
[00:21:08] <LordKalma> indeed
[00:21:12] <LordKalma> tailwind is cool though :p
[00:21:40] <LordKalma> used only a little of it, but it seems an actual sane framework
[00:21:57] <LordKalma> even if you don't get components out of the box as with bootstrap
[00:22:14] <LordKalma> tailwind-UI isn't expensive for an enterprise project, very cheap even, but I'm a hobbyist
[00:22:27] <LordKalma> anyway, I'll reask my question
[00:22:33] <LordKalma> and it's about the repo I just linked
[00:22:48] <LordKalma> the backend is basically a DRF powered REST API
[00:22:57] <LordKalma> with dj-auth in there as well
[00:23:13] <LordKalma> funny thing is, I have swagger-ui in my frontend for the lolz somewhere
[00:23:25] <LordKalma> and if I go to django-admin and login, and go back to my frontend
[00:23:35] <LordKalma> swagger shows me the logged-in-only methods
[00:23:39] <LordKalma> so I'm logged in
[00:23:41] <LordKalma> *magic* :D
[00:23:48] <LordKalma> (seriously though, why?)
[00:24:50] <FunkyBob> because you logged in
[00:25:07] <FunkyBob> where's the mystery?
[00:25:25] <LordKalma> but so the frontend "magically" shares the login cookie?
[00:25:28] <LordKalma> that's what I don't get
[00:25:52] <LordKalma> what mechanism is making my frontend aware I have login creds
[00:26:07] <FunkyBob> there's no "login cookie"
[00:26:09] <LordKalma> the frontend is just an axios request
[00:26:28] <LordKalma> oh, it's not with cookies?
[00:26:43] <FunkyBob> default django auth stores your user id in the session
[00:27:05] <FunkyBob> though I think the breakdown is you seem to think admin isn't part of your front end
[00:27:10] <FunkyBob> it's an app like all the rest
[00:27:31] <FunkyBob> it uses django.contrib.auth for login
[00:28:27] <LordKalma> I'm sorry for the complete n00b, but how is axios on the JS project accessing this session?
[00:28:42] <FunkyBob> the session is keyed by a cookie... so in t hat way, yes, it's by cookies
[00:28:47] <FunkyBob> but there is no 'auth' cookie
[00:29:20] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i'm writing a functional requirements document for my old app
[00:29:23] <LordKalma> okay, so again, how/why axios automatically picks up this cookie?
[00:29:28] <FunkyBob> (also... why axios in the browser. isn't the purpose of axios to provide a consistent API between front and backend JS?)
[00:29:35] <wallbroken> do you remember the project?
[00:29:43] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: because your browser does cookies properly
[00:29:49] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes
[00:30:06] <LordKalma> so it's like, my browser just adds it to the request for me
[00:30:09] <LordKalma> being in the same domain?
[00:30:25] <wallbroken> more of less, how many pages do you expect a document of that kind of app would be?
[00:30:29] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: typically, ytes... that's how cookies work
[00:30:37] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: however, not by default if you use fetch()
[00:30:47] <FunkyBob> that requires the `credentials` option set correctly
[00:30:55] <LordKalma> (about axios, idk, this is a pet project, I didn't even know JS a month ago, and the webs tells me to use axios, so I axios it)

[00:31:38] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, I'm not afraid of async code, no :)
[00:31:50] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
[00:32:19] <FunkyBob> this is the 'modern' native web API that replaces XmlHTTPRequest
[00:32:48] <LordKalma> when I actually deploy this stuff, what I have to get right is CORS. I have django-cors on the backend (followed the Django for APIs book)
[00:32:52] <LordKalma> hope to get it right after
[00:33:08] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: so your JS and your API are served from different domains?
[00:33:49] <LordKalma> I expect not in the end :)
[00:33:58] <FunkyBob> if not, you won't need to deal with CORS
[00:34:01] <LordKalma> cool
[00:34:02] <LordKalma> thanks
[00:34:04] <LordKalma> anyway

[00:34:10] <FunkyBob> why 'in the end' and not now?
[00:34:12] <LordKalma> right now, the project is veryyyy small
[00:34:18] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, because I haven't deployed it yet
[00:34:32] <LordKalma> it lives on docker on my machine :)
[00:34:33] <FunkyBob> but what are you doing _now_ that requires you to handle CORS?
[00:35:19] <LordKalma> before I setup some proxy stuff on webpack dev's server the API was in http://backend and webpack devserver in http://frontend
[00:35:36] <FunkyBob> what if I told you... you don't need to use webpack's dev server? :P
[00:35:44] <LordKalma> I've since configured webpack's dev server to behave like nginx will
[00:35:54] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, hot reload is nice when I don't know the hell I'm doing :p
[00:36:00] <FunkyBob> fair
[00:36:06] <LordKalma> I do use npm run build for the deployment :p
[00:36:26] <FunkyBob> but, yah, the proxy settings for webpack are not too involved...
[00:36:52] <LordKalma> byt yeah, I setup proxy, so that I can 1) use relative paths, 2) don't have to change anything for deployment
[00:37:02] <LordKalma> yeah, it was easy

[02:11:35] <GinFuyou> if you mean something like pretty profile url example.com/profiles/john_smith/ just have a slugfield that would be a part of url.
[02:11:52] <theprophet> GinFuyou to be more specific, i want user to create his own shorteen url
[02:12:03] <GinFuyou> or not slug field, if you want characters besice a-z0-9-_
[02:12:38] <theprophet> if he visits the site, he can think of his own url and add it to his long url

[02:17:49] <theprophet> can you please be kind and link me that exact part?
[02:18:42] <theprophet> i mean i never created anything from polls, all i did that involed web and input was voting
[02:18:44] <theprophet> am i wrong?
[02:19:23] <GinFuyou> Well, it doesn't do exactly that but all steps should be there. Make a model with a Slug- or CharField
[02:20:04] <theprophet> ok
[02:20:26] <GinFuyou> write a form - part 4
[02:21:02] <GinFuyou> vote form is different, but principle is still the same
[02:21:43] <theprophet> ok i make charfield
[02:22:00] <GinFuyou> https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_forms/ this has actually better part on forms
[02:22:47] <GinFuyou> yeah I think it's a good one for your case, it also shows how to save author \ user
[02:22:51] <theprophet> can i make two forms?
[02:23:02] <theprophet> like forms 2?
[02:23:17] <GinFuyou> Yes but why? Better start with one form on page and view
[02:23:21] <GinFuyou> for clarity
[02:23:30] <theprophet> because
[02:23:34] <theprophet> i want two endpoints
[02:23:40] <theprophet> in same app
[02:23:54] <theprophet> can i write in the same forms then?
[02:23:58] <theprophet> what i already have?
[02:24:36] <GinFuyou> I can't say without details. You can have as many forms as you want. But better to start with simple 1 form - 1 template - 1 view
[02:24:53] <GinFuyou> When you got it, you can mix whatever you want
[02:25:07] <theprophet> its just
[02:25:13] <theprophet> this paid internship is asking me that
[02:25:23] <theprophet> to make two endpoints
[02:25:26] <theprophet> and i was wondering
[02:25:43] <theprophet> but yes i already have 1, form 1 mod, view 1 template
[02:25:54] <GinFuyou> What exactly is meant by two endpoints, and how they relate to forms?
[02:25:58] <theprophet> and i want to have two endpoints in same app,
[02:26:09] <theprophet> i dont know, how it relate
[02:26:12] <theprophet> thats why i asked
[02:26:18] <theprophet> that should i make second forms
[02:26:31] <theprophet> or is it ok to use 1 form for multiple classes
[02:26:36] <nbjoerg> is it possible to silence the ForeignKey with unique=True warning?
[02:26:38] <theprophet> while i want two endpoints
[02:26:56] <nbjoerg> (fields.W342)
[02:28:23] <GinFuyou> theprophet, you probably mean html form now? Since I think I didn't see form class in your code
[02:29:02] <GinFuyou> I'm talking about django.form.Form class (or it's brother ModelForm)
[02:29:03] <theprophet> GinFuyou u did not cause it did not worked, when i left last time, i used different way to make that url generator app and i used forms
[02:29:20] <theprophet> forms,py no?
[02:29:25] <GinFuyou> Yes that
[02:29:34] <theprophet> ok, so yea now i have that
[02:29:58] <GinFuyou> Ok, so if endpoint is a page \ url on the site, better have 1 form for each that needs a form
[02:30:12] <GinFuyou> unless they send exactly same data ofc
[02:30:17] <theprophet> here https://ibb.co/PNv8RjF
[02:30:39] <GinFuyou> Yes, like that
[02:30:44] <theprophet> yea first endpoint is a random shorten url generator
[02:31:00] <theprophet> and now i want a second endpoint for user to create his own shorteen url
[02:31:17] <GinFuyou> So another enpoing will take both long_url and short_url (assuming naming)
[02:31:24] <theprophet> yes
[02:31:26] <theprophet>  exactly
[02:32:05] <GinFuyou> Then you can subclass this form or make a copy of it, with different fields. at this point it doesn't really matter
[02:32:16] <theprophet> so in this case do i need a second form.py or not?
[02:32:32] <theprophet> ohh ok so i need a second forms.py
[02:32:40] <GinFuyou> but subclassing will mean subclassing inner Meta class as well, it may give out it's not done by a newbie
[02:32:58] <theprophet> yea that sounds complicated tbh
[02:33:02] <GinFuyou> no, you don't need second forms.py file. Just new class in the same one

[03:40:06] <theprophet> n othing
[03:40:15] <theprophet> i was just trying to render it in templates
[03:40:25] <theprophet> that thing i was talking about earlier
[03:40:36] *** Joins: bss (bss@rie.incorporeal.org)
[03:41:23] <GinFuyou> well, there is a chance that user goes to short url token that was deleted or never existed (e.g. user typoed)
[03:41:41] <GinFuyou> As most simple case you could raise a 404 error
[03:41:55] <theprophet> i cant even see that form class
[03:42:03] <theprophet> i created in test site for django
[03:42:06] <GinFuyou> e.g. using shortcut get_object_pr_404()
[03:42:25] <theprophet> i get that error when i go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/yoururl
[03:42:26] <GinFuyou> Well with error you won't see anything of your view or template
[03:43:08] <GinFuyou> what does view on that url?
[03:44:07] <theprophet> https://ibb.co/KNPSm2Y
[03:44:09] <theprophet> this
[03:44:58] <theprophet> i wrote a view  for UrlForm2 , since i already have for UrlForm
[03:45:14] <GinFuyou> you are not hitting that view, probably you have issue in your urls.py
[03:45:28] <GinFuyou> I suspect catch-all patterm
[03:45:31] <GinFuyou> *n
[03:46:16] <theprophet> GinFuyou this is my https://ibb.co/5BgRmVH urls.py
[03:47:28] <GinFuyou>  '/yoururl/' will match '<str:token>' pattern. because it catches any string (excluding '/')
[03:48:13] <theprophet> what can i do? :(
[03:48:16] <GinFuyou> basically this way django thinks that "yoururl" is a short url token. Because how it will know it's not
[03:49:12] <theprophet> i am so tired and so ashamed that i am wasting so much time of yours
[03:49:20] <theprophet> but please help me
[03:49:48] <GinFuyou> one way is to prefix that pattern with something. e.g. path("url/<str:token>")
[03:50:24] <theprophet> let me try
[03:50:26] <GinFuyou> another would be moving it to the very end of the list
[03:51:12] <GinFuyou> third is making more strict rule on token matching. But I think it's a bit more advanced than you want it now
[03:53:00] <theprophet> it fixed it
[03:53:04] <theprophet> thank you gin
[03:53:21] <theprophet> but can you tell me how do i display this form now?

[04:04:22] <GinFuyou> How your form code looks? have you added the second field?
[04:04:40] <theprophet> this is how it looks like
[04:05:18] <theprophet> GinFuyou https://ibb.co/FnFMGJj
[04:09:36] <GinFuyou> yes, I told you need a second field in fields = [...] line. Did you forget?
[04:10:04] <theprophet> no i did not, i tought u meant like in second class :(
[04:10:15] <GinFuyou> in second class yes
[04:10:31] <theprophet> ye but i counted from first field in first class
[04:10:32] <GinFuyou> they are now exactly the same
[04:10:41] <theprophet> and i tought second field was already there when i created second class
[04:11:20] <theprophet> what do i write in second field?
[04:11:28] <GinFuyou> not sure what you mean. line 14 on your screencap. this attributes tells django which fields from the model to use in the form
[04:12:26] <theprophet> this is how it looks now
[04:12:34] <theprophet> fields = ['long_url'] []
[04:12:46] <theprophet> what do i write in second bracket
[04:13:09] <GinFuyou> nope, ['long_url', 'other_field', 'even_more_fields_maybe']
[04:13:22] <GinFuyou> string which matches name of model field
[04:13:25] <theprophet> ah
[04:14:31] <theprophet> this is models
[04:14:32] <theprophet> https://ibb.co/3STzdj1
[04:15:18] <theprophet> should i add all 3 fields from models?
[04:15:55] <theprophet> or add 2 of them , create_url and long_url
[04:18:13] <GinFuyou> well, which you want to edit (fill) in the form
[04:18:45] <theprophet> i want create_url and then to show this created url
[04:19:16] <theprophet> to do this, first i need to save it then render right?
[04:19:30] <theprophet> now i have create_url field
[04:20:16] <GinFuyou> I'm not following. I thought we were doing a form where user can enter own short form of an (long) url?
[04:20:34] <theprophet> yes i did it
[04:20:43] <theprophet> but when i create url
[04:20:47] <theprophet> its not showing anywhere

[04:44:32] <theprophet> but i have a feeling that i am missing something
[04:44:56] <GinFuyou> form.save() would be enough instead of two lines, this with commit=False used in some special cases
[04:45:14] <theprophet> so i dont need it?
[04:45:55] <GinFuyou> just form.save() will be 100% same thing. Just remember this trick for future.
[04:46:05] <theprophet> ok
[04:46:10] <GinFuyou> well, yeah, it missing a redirect after successful submit and rendering form with errors on bad input
[04:46:34] <theprophet> yes
[04:46:36] <GinFuyou> that would make it a full minimal form-handling view

[04:47:05] <theprophet> all i need to redirect to the where it will show the made url
[04:47:15] <GinFuyou> oh, and line 29 is more logically goes under line 30
[04:47:29] <theprophet> oh ok
[04:47:45] <GinFuyou> line 36 why it's not a form?
[04:48:08] <GinFuyou> it should be same form. It's a case for empty form
[04:48:19] <theprophet> ah
[04:48:27] <theprophet> ok i will remove else too
[04:48:51] <GinFuyou> don't remove, change it for correct form init
[04:49:10] <GinFuyou> and add redirect at the end of is_valid() if case
[04:49:31] <GinFuyou> redirect to same url. It's how forms are usually handled
[04:50:14] <theprophet> i dont know how to do that :(
[04:50:22] <theprophet> i know its sounds easy but, its not for me
[04:50:31] <theprophet> i never seen that how its done

[04:55:24] <theprophet> like this? https://ibb.co/sHrhswN GinFuyou

[08:15:00] <pembo13> theprophet, what's up?
[08:15:30] <theprophet> pembo13 i want to redirect to db after submiting
[08:15:44] <pembo13> what do you mean by "db" ?
[08:15:50] <theprophet> database
[08:16:01] <theprophet> to where the submited shortened url is being saved
[08:16:20] <theprophet> in short
[08:16:31] <pembo13> give me an example, the words you're using together don't make as much sense
[08:16:37] <theprophet> i created a app, with two endpoints, one that generates shorteen url
[08:16:59] <theprophet> and another creates shorteen url with users choice
[08:17:08] <theprophet> the generator one works
[08:17:49] <pembo13> ok
[08:17:50] <theprophet> but sumbiting one does not, cause i have a redirect, but it redirects on the same endpoint ( submiting and creating) and it just stays there
[08:18:06] *** Quits: Donitz (~Donitz@88-115-149-152.elisa-laajakaista.fi) (Quit: Leaving)

[08:18:38] <theprophet> what i want to do is to redirect where it will be possible to show the user that his shortened url was created
[08:18:46] <theprophet> ok i will past everything
[08:18:52] <theprophet> give me maximum 1 minute

[08:20:52] <theprophet> ok
[08:21:29] <theprophet> pembo13 https://dpaste.org/O8GN
[08:21:40] <theprophet> i can show you templates too if its neccessary
[08:22:21] <pembo13> theprophet, which view works, and which doesn't?
[08:22:35] <theprophet> every view works
[08:22:38] <theprophet> its just
[08:23:04] <theprophet> i dont know how to make the one that will help me to redirect
[08:23:04] <pembo13> which view works as expected, and which gives the isue
[08:23:05] <theprophet> to the DB
[08:23:14] <theprophet> i havent created that one yet
[08:23:30] <theprophet> i got only 1 view left which i havent made yet
[08:23:44] <theprophet> the one that will redirect user after submiting to the db
[08:23:55] <theprophet> where the submited shorteen url will be saved
[08:24:07] <theprophet> i want it to be shown in web
[08:25:23] <theprophet> as you can see theres
[08:25:25] <theprophet> form.save()
[08:25:25] <theprophet>             return redirect('yoururl')
[08:26:02] <theprophet> and it redirects the user creating and submiting endpoint to the same place as it begins
[08:26:03] <pembo13> theprophet, so you want to redirect to the newly created short url
[08:26:09] <theprophet> yes
[08:26:36] <theprophet> which will have a view that points at submited and created shortened url
[08:26:51] <theprophet> in db
[08:27:41] <theprophet> so everytime some1 creates a custom shortened url, it will redirect them to the point where the message or something else will inform the user that "HERES YOUR CUSTOM SHORTENED URL'
[08:28:10] <pembo13> ah
[08:28:12] <pembo13> ok
[08:28:25] <theprophet> can you help me to write that view ?
[08:28:31] <pembo13> in that case, you need a view to show the URL
[08:28:35] <theprophet> becuase if i will have view, i can make path for it
[08:28:47] <theprophet> yes exactly
[08:29:24] <pembo13> create a view that takes a parameter, just like your realurl, and instead of redirecting like readurl does, just display the url to the template
[08:29:38] <theprophet> but i am so tired that my brain does not work anymore and i dont know how to write that view. and i have only 1 day left for submiting that thing. cause its for paid internship
[08:29:54] <pembo13> so basically, take duplicate `realurl` and instead od return a redirect, render a template
[08:30:33] <theprophet> but it has token and stuf
[08:30:41] <pembo13> theprophet, and?
[08:30:53] <theprophet> and i dont know if its going to work without tokens
[08:31:32] <pembo13> but you have the token when the form is saved, no?
[08:31:50] <theprophet> thats for only
[08:31:56] <theprophet> generator
[08:32:02] <theprophet> i dont want it for custom
[08:32:16] <pembo13> ah
[08:32:32] <pembo13> well use the model id then
[08:32:42] <theprophet> please write that view for me
[08:32:56] <theprophet> i will use it for the next time too
[08:33:09] <theprophet> so i dont ask anybody else and learn myself
[08:35:16] <pembo13> ok... i'm not 100% clear yet, so which view do you want to start with, work flow wise?
[08:35:27] <pembo13> shortfn or custurl?
[08:35:37] <theprophet> none of them
[08:35:53] <theprophet> oh no
[08:35:54] <theprophet> no no
[08:35:56] <theprophet> sorry custurl
[08:35:57] <theprophet> yes
[08:35:59] <pembo13> ok
[08:36:02] <theprophet> only custurl
[08:36:19] <pembo13> so after the submit the form in custurl, you want to show them the shortened url, correct?
[08:36:50] <theprophet> yes
[08:36:52] <theprophet> exactly
[08:36:59] <theprophet> on the same page after redirect
[08:37:15] <theprophet> so it would inform user that heres your customr shortened url
[08:37:49] <pembo13> in that case... don't do `return redirect('yoururl')
[08:37:58] <theprophet> yes
[08:38:00] <theprophet> of course
[08:38:28] <theprophet> i will redirect the path that will show that
[08:38:30] <theprophet> message
[08:38:37] <theprophet> and db
[08:39:05] <pembo13> what/where is the shortened URL after POSTing to custurl?
[08:39:52] <theprophet> its not there
[08:39:56] <theprophet> i havent created that
[08:40:07] <theprophet> its just stays on the same page
[08:40:18] <theprophet>  /  yoururl
[08:40:55] <theprophet> the field just dissapers and thats it
[08:41:03] <theprophet> field for creating shortened custom url
[08:41:07] <pembo13> hmm... there's a lot weird with your code
[08:41:08] <pembo13> but
[08:41:39] <pembo13> What's supposed to be the diff between `Short_url` and `Crurl`?
[08:41:59] <theprophet> is not it suppose to look like this?
[08:42:00] <theprophet> def inda(request):
[08:42:01] <theprophet>     object = Mowmoba.objects.all()
[08:42:01] <theprophet>     return render(request, "piradoba/ind.html", {'object': object})
[08:42:52] <theprophet> short url?
[08:42:56] <theprophet> what you mean?
[08:43:09] <pembo13> so i think you have a lot of problems with the code
[08:43:18] <pembo13> that's why I'm having so many issues understanding
[08:43:18] <theprophet> like what?
[08:43:24] <pembo13> so let's go back to basics...
[08:43:27] <pembo13> why do you have to models?
[08:43:52] <theprophet> because i had a problem earlier
[08:43:59] <theprophet> and thats how django doc teaches
[08:44:03] <theprophet> with polls ap
[08:44:07] <theprophet> QUESTION class
[08:44:14] <theprophet> and vote
[08:44:20] <theprophet> answer CLASS
[08:44:32] <theprophet> i was getting really weird error
[08:44:40] <theprophet> it was saying that i had a duplicate
[08:44:41] <pembo13> Okay, but those represent to different types of data
[08:44:42] <theprophet> Key
[08:44:50] <pembo13> in your case, you only need one type of data
[08:45:01] <theprophet> i had it like that
[08:45:08] <theprophet> but it was giving me a eror
[08:45:12] <theprophet> which i could not solve
[08:45:40] <pembo13> well let's start with a new model, let's call it `ShortUrl`
[08:45:45] <pembo13> you can remove the other two
[08:46:02] <pembo13> you need a `token` field, which would be unique
[08:46:03] <theprophet> lets start from begining?
[08:46:18] <theprophet> oh no no:(  i dont understand tokens and stuf
[08:46:47] <pembo13> ok call it slug instead of token then
[08:46:56] <theprophet> ok
[08:47:24] <theprophet> i dellete
[08:47:29] <theprophet> second model
[08:47:34] <theprophet> and add to the first model what?
[08:48:08] <pembo13> so you should have a model like this now: https://dpaste.org/axhr
[08:48:11] <pembo13> just the one
[08:48:35] <theprophet> ok then what
[08:49:14] <pembo13> then make changes to shortfn, so that it works with your new model
[08:50:09] <theprophet> i cant do that, ok i will go back to what i had
[08:50:17] <theprophet> thank you friend
[08:50:21] <pembo13> ok
[08:50:24] <pembo13> you're welcome
[08:55:48] <theprophet> pembo13 which model field has always unique ID? pk?
[08:57:01] <pembo13> id
[08:57:16] <theprophet> Id is the field?
[08:57:42] <pembo13> yes

[12:59:00] <FunkyBob> you could use materialised views, and front them in django with unmanaged models
[12:59:21] <ktosiek[m]> I'd go with `PricePerMinute`, `PricePer5Minutes` etc., but yeah.

[13:00:53] <ktosiek[m]> materialized views are handy if you can afford to always recompute the whole view, it's much simpler than implementing incremental updates.

[13:02:30] *** Joins: iomari891 (~iomari891@197.210.70.65)
[13:05:22] <pycode> FunkyBob, yes matviews should be do the job and i also update the matviews with new data only instead of recreating everything

[13:06:01] <ktosiek[m]> pycode: "why?" to which question? :-D
[13:06:04] <pycode> i mean...if i add new data on 1minute and then call the "update" postgresql should look at new data only
[13:06:05] <pycode> no?
[13:06:14] <pycode> ktosiek[m], incremental update i mean
[13:06:15] *** Quits: goutly (~gitly@185.69.144.136) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:07:36] <ktosiek[m]> no, that's not how materialized views currently work. They always recompute the whole view query, and then (depending on how you refresh them) either update the changed rows, or just replace the whole table.
[13:07:52] *** Joins: goutly (~gitly@85.255.233.150)
[13:08:05] <ktosiek[m]> but if you only load data once a day they can get you pretty far, you'll just have to monitor your refresh times

[13:10:01] <pycode> ktosiek[m], yes my biggest timeframe is 1 day and i update everything every day, so i need to recompute the last day for 5min for 15mins etc
[13:10:05] <pycode> one time a day
[13:11:03] <ktosiek[m]> then you should probably go with FunkyBob's suggestion and use mat views.
[13:11:28] <pycode> ktosiek[m], it is correct what you said...i  mean matview recompute the query, sure, but will update the rows is something has changed
[13:12:19] <pycode> is something / IF something...

[13:30:07] <pycode> ktosiek[m], no?
[13:30:23] <pycode> i mean postgresql checks internally if some rows have changed
[13:30:31] <pycode> instead of truncate the entire table and recreate it
[13:32:01] <ktosiek[m]> depends on if you use `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`, which compares new and old results and only updates the changed rows, or use a plain `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, which is typically faster but locks the table and rewrites it.

[19:16:32] <theprophet> GinFuyou the fact is, message has to do the same, to show the generated url and i dont know how to do this

[19:17:20] <GinFuyou> The link has almost all the code, you only need to make a string of that message
[19:17:26] <theprophet> when user thinks and submits his own custom shorten url it goes to the database, but i dont know how to grab that particular data that was recently created and show it in the web
[19:18:04] <GinFuyou> as I said: obj = form.save() then access obj attributes. e.g. obj.long_url
[19:18:24] <GinFuyou> form.save() returns object that was saved
[19:18:45] <theprophet> yesterday i made a second class in models.py
[19:19:08] <theprophet> because i was having error that i could not fix without making asecond model for creating and submiting shorten url
[19:19:19] <theprophet> and what you say now is not good for me i  guess
[19:19:29] <GinFuyou> I never said that
[19:19:34] <theprophet> i know
[19:19:41] <theprophet> you never said that
[19:19:46] <theprophet> i did it my own
[19:20:00] <theprophet> i had to make a different table in db
[19:20:03] <GinFuyou> I said that I don't see why you need a second model. It might be so or not
[19:20:14] <theprophet> because i had duplicate key error which i could not fix without making a new table
[19:20:25] <GinFuyou> And I don't see how it's related to current problem
[19:20:33] <theprophet> no no,  i know you u never said it

[19:32:14] <theprophet> GinFuyou nothing is left to do actually except to just show in web when user submits his own custorm shorten url, thats it. theres nothing else i want.
[19:32:33] <GinFuyou> theprophet, i'm kind of lost what the second view does now. It appears to have a single field?
[19:32:51] <GinFuyou> You haven't fixed some mistakes too
[19:33:32] <theprophet> ye only single field for user to be able to create his own shorten url
[19:34:05] <GinFuyou> what is the point of shorten url, if there is no long url? So was it like for a profile link on same site?
[19:34:21] <theprophet> i dont know bro
[19:34:27] <theprophet> thats what they ask me to do
[19:34:30] <theprophet> look
[19:34:54] <theprophet> API for premium clients to create URL with custom name (url/<custom>)
[19:35:03] <theprophet> this is what they are asking me to do
[19:35:18] <GinFuyou> That's all? It's not very detailed
[19:35:30] <theprophet> yes thats it
[19:35:52] <GinFuyou> Ok, then let's take it the way you did.
[19:36:02] <theprophet> Required features:-        API to create URL with random short name (something like this url/78sda8s6d), url random name should be fixed size string and unique per url-        API for premium clients to create URL with custom name (url/<custom>)-        Input url validation, that it is a correct url and size must be below 250 characterAu-
[19:36:03] <theprophet> Counters - how many times the url was accessed (optional requirement)-        Automatic deletion of urls older than 30 days (optional requirement)
[19:36:05] <GinFuyou> Do you have auth?
[19:36:08] <theprophet> oh sorry
[19:36:21] <theprophet> auth , you mean admin?
[19:36:30] <pycode> GinFuyou, for i in range(1, p.num_pages+1) ?
[19:37:16] <GinFuyou> theprophet, users can login. I presumed you don't have except for admin
[19:37:32] <theprophet> yes, i only have for admin
[19:37:43] <GinFuyou> since it talks about premium users makes me think we need to save user. But it's not clear
[19:37:44] <theprophet> not user auth
[19:38:00] <GinFuyou> If there is no auth it's pointless then
[19:38:12] <theprophet> yes
[19:40:43] <theprophet> whats left is just when user makes his own custom shorten url, to be attached for example 127.0.0.1:8000/custorm url like this and be shown after user does the operation
[19:40:46] <theprophet> thats it

[19:46:07] <GinFuyou> theprophet, btw which python version are you using? I want to use f-string, it requires iirc 3.6+
