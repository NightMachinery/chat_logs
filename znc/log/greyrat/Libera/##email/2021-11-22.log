[17:14:33] <mmlj4> I'm having consistent issues sending to any outlook.com-related domains, I suspect it's because they rely on that ridiculous useprotect.net blackmail RLB that everyone else refuses to use, which claims linode is a spam block. how can I get postfix to send to outlook domains? I'm open to suggestions. Thanks.
[17:21:52] <Khepra> relay through a nonblacklisted network
[17:22:25] <mmlj4> I've considered that, if I could locate such
[17:22:26] <Khepra> or describe the issues, maybe it's something else
[17:22:34] <Khepra> mmlj4: build it yourself. 
[17:23:07] <mmlj4> standing up a server is easy, but where to put it that isn't blacklisted? no clue
[17:23:37] <Khepra> so what's the _actual_ issue?
[17:25:36] <mmlj4> regarding the issues, I've gotten sporadic DSNs saying my netblock is suspect. I can send to any other domain I want, no issues that I've seen. mxtookbox occasionally reports I'm listed on useprotect. lastly, I've been running SMTP servers for 20 years and an not a newbie :-/
[17:27:04] *** Joins: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal)
[17:27:11] <Khepra> you mean UCEprotect, not USE?
[17:27:13] <mmlj4> also, requesting an unblock occasionally gets me an automated reply, but that rarely accomplishes anything
[17:27:27] <mmlj4> use UCEprotect... did I typo it?
[17:27:59] <mmlj4> er, yes UCEprotect, sorry...
[17:28:00] <Khepra> twice, that's why I wasn't sure you're typoing
[17:28:17] <mmlj4> ah, I see that now, heh
[17:28:59] <Khepra> I'm not sure MS/Outlook uses something like a (bad reputation) third party service to block delivery. They're too big for that, and third party maybe have a lot of incentive to subvert MS with false negatives
[17:29:49] <mmlj4> um, everyone uses RBLs, surely
[17:30:02] <Khepra> probably not
[17:30:26] <Khepra> small time MTA admins probably do. Massive companies at the scale of Outlook most like do not
[17:31:18] <Khepra> they _might_ be using them as source of signals in their more complicated autonomous decision making, but I seriously doubt they'd be relying on single provider, such as UCE, to completely block delivery to the vast MS userbase
[17:32:07] <Khepra> It's more likely your hosting company or neighborhood is.... less than stellar in reputation.
[17:32:36] <Khepra> as an example. We host our (MTA) servers at Hetzner. IP/subnet based delivery issues are very, very rarely an issue.
[17:32:45] <Khepra> now try sending something out of OVH. 
[17:34:23] <Khepra> Now Hetzner, they have automation in place. Abuse reports are handled by that automation, in so that you get a report more than once in some (short) period and automation is nuking your IP address connectivity until you explain yourself to a human. If that happens more than once or twice, you're booted out.
[17:35:42] <mmlj4> if Linode is a spewer (and I'm sure occasional account holders do send out garbage), why doesn't anyone else block me? as noted, mxtoolbox consistently says I'm clean, aside from the occasional UCEprotect entry
[17:37:09] <Khepra> that's a question for Outlook
[17:37:53] <Khepra> Linode is a spamfest. To get an account at Hetzner you need to submit passport or ID and things like that. AFAIK Linode is one of those 'merican companies that do no such thing and everyone and their dog can sign up.
[17:38:20] <Khepra> I think they even have or had a free period where you "just" supply a (possibly stolen) CC info but you're not charged for the first month. That's, if still going on, is haven for spammers.
[17:38:33] <Khepra> DO does or did the same. DO is another of ill reputed networks to send out mail from.
[17:41:17] <rob0> I do think Linode acts on abuse complaints, though.  They're relatively clean in that regard.  And they do limit outbound 25 by default.
[17:41:47] <Khepra> and yet I see lots of spam from them
[17:41:54] <rob0> ok
[17:42:04] <Khepra> and, actually, more than spam I see much more bruteforcers trying to subvert my SASLs :)
[17:42:36] <rob0> yeah, that would be something they would not / cannot block by default

[19:54:50] <rob0> yes, MS does not use public DNSBLs (nor do most large receivers)

[20:27:33] <Riviera> ah
[20:27:34] <Riviera> no idea
[20:27:43] <mmlj4> I guess, anyway
[20:41:21] <rob0> you should clarify
[20:42:25] <rob0> most SMS providers have email-to-SMS gateways, such as 5555551212@txt.att.net for AT&T
[20:43:06] <rob0> you want something you send SMS to, that then forwards it to email?
[20:51:24] <Khepra> for DIY, and I'm thinking OTOH here, you can plug a GSM USB thingy in your linux box, there's software to manage it (I forgot the names), esp. send and receive SMS. From there I take it'd be trivial to convert and send out an email once you manage to receive SMS
[20:51:25] <moogs> I have a business-need to receive text messages. 
[20:51:48] <moogs> I do not have a phone number per se, but would like one established to receive messages without needing a device.
[20:52:04] <Khepra> It's been at least 10 years since I investigated that possibility, but then tech advancements rolled over that, and we dropped SMS in favor of direct IMs and tons of other protos

[21:31:37] <rob0> and GV is probably the best suggestion
