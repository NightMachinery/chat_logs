[00:02:34] <lizmat> a trait is nothing more / less than a piece of code that will get run during compilation time
[00:03:02] <lizmat> with the (meta-)object as the invocant
[00:03:28] <lizmat> what it does, who knows?  so you cannot answer that question like that in general
[00:04:38] <lizmat> m: sub trait_mod:<is>(Mu, :$foo!) { say "foo" }; sub bar is foo { }
[00:04:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ecc8308f: OUTPUT: «foo␤»
[00:08:56] <guifa> lizmat: okees, I guess then the question is more specific to particular traits ha
[00:09:39] <guifa> m: role Foo is repr('Uninstantiable') { }; class Bar does Foo { }; Bar.new.say;
[00:09:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ecc8308f: OUTPUT: «Bar.new␤»
[00:10:48] <guifa> This actually works *exactly* how I'd like it to (so yay), but it also feels like I'd expect the repr('Uninstantiable') trait to compose into the Bar class

[21:27:03] <[Coke]> is there a way to ask git what the default branch is, or is that something you need the hosting service to verify?
[21:27:53] <[Coke]> I have a dump of master vs. main for a bunch of git repos, but am wondering if a git command line can find the answer.
[21:29:59] <tonyo> [Coke]: git remote show origin | sed -n '/HEAD branch/s/.*: //p'
[21:31:17] <[Coke]> tonyo++
[21:31:38] <Altreus> assuming origin is on default-branch
[21:33:05] <tonyo> yes
[21:33:26] <tonyo> if you only have one remote set up then you can use substitution too: git remote show $(git remote show) | sed -n '/HEAD branch/s/.*: //p'
[21:33:59] <tonyo> i imagine it's fairly uncommon to have multiple remotes
[21:37:25] <Altreus> ~
[21:37:37] <Altreus> I often have at least one other because I don't trust github to do PRs properly
[21:38:22] <Altreus> origin is, however, usually the right one to use
[21:42:15] <[Coke]> in this case, it's all a single remote, I've a list of repos, clone them just so I can work with a local copy.
[21:47:34] <tonyo> Altreus: do you ever have a different default branch on them?
[21:48:19] <Altreus> fair point, no
[21:48:48] <tonyo> i suppose piping that interpolated git remote show |head -n 1 would be safer
