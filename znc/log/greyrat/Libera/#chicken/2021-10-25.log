[10:00:35] <amazigh> dunno yet, just exploring the websocket story.
[10:01:38] <Guest-liao> That is cool. Is any SRFI about it?
[10:02:21] <Guest-liao> I supposed that it is part of one SRFI, not separated one. 
[10:05:06] <amazigh> no, there is no srfi about it yet.
[10:05:13] <amazigh> there is no srfi about http either
[10:06:03] <Guest-liao> but sound like it is in pre-srfi.
[10:06:19] <amazigh> yes, there is pre-srfi (that I started)
[10:06:28] <Guest-liao> Cool
[10:07:18] <amazigh> fwiw, the pre-srfi only covers http reader and writer, you need to hook socket possibly tls sockets. and AFAIU / AFAICT chicken's eggs related to the web are more mature that those
[10:08:41] <amazigh> (http pre-srfi code is very slow, and not synched with the spec)
[10:09:07] <Guest-liao> Why?
[10:09:11] <amazigh> (very slow = can be better easily)

[10:29:47] <Guest-liao> scheme.generator is not in r7rs egg yet.
[10:35:02] <wasamasa> r7rs egg implements r7rs-small and no (scheme generator) there, lol
[10:36:03] <wasamasa> whereas srfi-121 has an egg
[10:37:04] <wasamasa> srfi-158, too
[10:37:40] <Guest-liao> And the module declare  '(library (arew network http)'

[10:39:40] <wasamasa> https://git.sr.ht/~amirouche/arew
[10:43:51] <Guest-liao> Yes, generator.scm file in his repo.
[10:46:45] <Guest-liao> the syntax for import like '(import (srfi srfi-158))'
[10:47:05] <Guest-liao> is that in chicken?

[10:48:47] <wasamasa> (import (srfi 158))

[10:50:39] <Guest-liao> Okay. I see.
[10:51:03] <Guest-liao> it is chez
[10:51:12] <wasamasa> no, it uses chez
[10:51:29] <wasamasa> arew is an r7rs implementation built with chez

[19:15:53] <nikola2> you could split them into different files and used them with (load "filename")
[19:16:03] <nikola2> it basically works like #include in c

[22:45:20] <aportnoy> teiresias: thanks, I didn't know that existed for IRC!
[22:51:29] <teiresias> Yeah.  Even if you don't use cert FP, you probably want to be using SASL.  It happens much earlier in the connection process, and -- at least this was true at one time -- some IP ranges are disallowed unless SASL is used.  E.G., way back in 2013-2014 I couldn't connect to freenode (RIP) from my mobile carrier without SASL.  SASL gives you a couple different authentication mechanisms, namely password and cert FP.
