[00:48:16] <mickey8> whats an efficient yet not over complicated way of stripping @mentions and #hashtags from a string? regex replaces or something?
[00:48:41] <b0nn> strings.Replace
[00:48:43] <mickey8> i have to run a lot of strings through that sanitation function so it can't be resources abusive
[00:49:31] <mickey8> b0nn but what would be the replaced string? it's something like @[^\s]+
[00:49:59] <zsnes> do you want to remove emails too? because that would do that
[00:50:07] <zsnes> and strings.Replace does not take a regex, its just a fixed string replace
[00:50:15] <b0nn> yeah, my bad
[00:50:54] <mickey8> zsnes i dont mind if it removes emails as well, or not, doesn't matter
[00:51:12] <mickey8> i could tweak it afterwards, i just need a concept
[00:51:56] <zsnes> well that would cause just the second part of the email removed, which is going to be confusing.
[00:52:30] <mickey8> my best guess is to use regex to find the "strings" that match the regex and then replaceall these
[00:52:35] <zsnes> you could use \b@[^\s+]+ to make sure its only on word boundaries or something..
[00:53:02] <mickey8> but that feels like something that would consume too much resources when applied on a bunch of strings
[00:53:05] <zsnes> err \b@[^\s]+ i mean

[00:54:40] <mickey8> that \b doesn't seem to work well (trying it on regex101.com), it doesn't match any of the @mentions

[20:21:29] <rawtaz> if you have created a module e.g. github.com/foo/bar and published it on github, and you then move your source code from github to e.g. bitbucket or whatever, must you then change the module path in the source code? i guess that in a go.mod one can use the "replace" to replace the module path, but im curious how important it is that you have a correlation between where you host the code publically and the module path in the code.
[20:21:47] <rawtaz> if you move it presumably people using it have to update their source code/deps
[20:22:17] <rawtaz> at the same time it seems silly that one has to match one's source code module name with where it is hosted

[20:28:51] <fizzie> It's a "natural" consequence from the fact that Go uses remote import paths -- https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Remote_import_paths -- to figure out how to get the code, rather than defining that somewhere else.
[20:33:07] <fizzie> I guess you *could* have a scheme where the path used "inside" the module doesn't need to match how it was imported, but as it stands I do think the tools will complain if you're using an import path that doesn't match the `module ...` specification of the code it's referring to.
[20:33:57] <fizzie> (If you're just building in the context of that module -- as in, that's the main module -- the name doesn't have to match anything; but I guess the question was about when it's being used as a dependency.)
[20:36:44] <rawtaz> makes sense. i also read that page you linked to and it explains how one can "redirect" module fetching when changing the url or similar :)
[20:38:14] <fizzie> Yeah, there's the ?go-get / <meta name="go-import" ...> mechanism for so-called "vanity" import paths (maybe a little unfair name).

[20:42:29] <fizzie> dreamcat4: If you upgraded from a version of Go older than 1.16, then that's probably because from 1.16 onwards, module-aware mode is now on by default, as described in https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.16#go-command

[20:43:54] <fizzie> Forgetting about $GOPATH completely and doing all your development in modules, most likely.

[20:44:45] <rawtaz> embrace it :3

[20:46:17] <rewt> you're trying to "go build" something?
[20:46:38] <dreamcat4> inside my GOPATH (~/.go/*) is 3 folders: bin/, pkg/, and src/

[20:46:53] <rewt> what are you REALLY trying to do?  how did you get here?
[20:47:05] <dreamcat4> inside bin/* is a whole list of different individual cmdline tools which i rely upon
[20:47:20] <dreamcat4> and you are now telling me to ignore the very things which i wish to hold onto
[20:47:45] <fizzie> rawtaz: I think the example is just describing the (slightly weird) case where "example.org" is the module, and /pkg/foo is a package in the module. It doesn't *have* to be like that: if you want to have multiple modules on that domain, you can have "example.org/mod1/pkg/foo" which will fetch https://example.org/mod1/pkg/foo?go-get=1 from which you can serve meta go-import contents of
[20:47:47] <fizzie> "example.org/mod1 git https://example.com/x/y/z".
[20:47:53] <rewt> no, i'm saying you don't need to worry about any of that
[20:48:20] <rewt> to update go tools, just `go install` them, and they'll get put where they need to be
[20:48:34] <rewt> but i'm still just guessing at what you're really trying to do...
[20:49:18] <fizzie> If you're just installing binaries from somewhere else, that's `go install` which will still write to $GOBIN (or $GOPATH/bin, or ~/go/bin, as fallbacks). Just don't try to do `go get` for that.
[20:50:37] <rawtaz> fizzie: thanks. ill just try it when it comes to that :)
[20:50:42] <dreamcat4> ok. my goal is: to run a command (or set of commands) to update all those tools which were installed by `go install`
[20:51:14] <dreamcat4> but ATM i have no idea if my existing installed go cmdline tools were installed with `go install`, because they were installed historically pre 1.16 with `go get`
[20:51:40] <rewt> are they no longer working?
[20:51:58] <rawtaz> on a related but different note; when you create a small app for a customer that's supposed to run on their systems, do you put like customer.com/foo or yourcompany.com/foo in the module path? like do you identify the app with your company or the customer's?
[20:51:58] <dreamcat4> so (according to you) i should 'just forget about that'. but then i don't have them anymore. they are still here in my `GOPATH` but they are what? migrated automatically?
[20:52:20] <rewt> why wouldn't you have them any more?
[20:52:29] <rewt> if they're there, they're there
[20:53:04] <rawtaz> i realize theres probably no practical difference to it, as long as its not being published anywhere. so im just curious if there are some other smart factors (besides if they explicitly asked to have their own identifier) to consider.

[20:57:11] <rewt> that doesn't say what it does
[20:57:15] <fizzie> The reason why it says that is because in module-aware mode, what "all" means is "all the transitive dependencies of the current main module", so you can't define that without a module.
[20:57:29] <fizzie> ("The -u flag adds information about available upgrades.")
[20:58:28] <dreamcat4> nothing here is at all clear about how somebody should transition from the old pre-1.16 system to using modules, i'm afraid you lost me (again)
[20:58:42] <fizzie> If you want to use Go as a "package manager" for command-line tools in module-aware mode, I imagine the way to do that would be to create a new module that has `require` statements for all the tools you're interested in in its go.mod file, at which point I imagine you could again use `go list -u -m all`.
[20:59:16] <fizzie> Or else just maintain a shell script that calls `go install ...` for all the tools, which will AIUI fetch and build and install the currently newest version.
[20:59:48] <dreamcat4> ok so can `go install` update that module file automatically?
[21:00:19] <rewt> you can `go install` binaries; for modules it's still `go get`
[21:01:02] <fizzie> Disclaimer: I've never tried to use Go for that, so can't really offer any advice on what's the best way to do it, that sort of pseudo-module was just a guess.

[21:03:58] <rewt> yeah, that stuff is pretty much not needed with modules afaik
[21:04:55] <dreamcat4> so i should reinstall them first, with `go install $toolname_uri@latest`. then nuke the whole `src/**/*` folder subtree, right?
[21:04:56] <fizzie> Since with modules you must have the possibility of having multiple different versions of the same module in your system at the same time, the $GOPATH/src tree doesn't really make sense.
[21:05:07] <dreamcat4> is that the correct way to upgrade?
[21:05:57] <fizzie> That sounds reasonable, yes. Assuming you still need all of them. The ones that are just libraries used as dependencies you don't really need to "reinstall", they'll be downloaded and built as a consequence of installing the tools.
[21:06:41] <dreamcat4> because in my `$GOPATH/bin` i only have 33 tools here. which is not too many to do all manually. it would not be that onerous a task. fairly straightforward

[21:08:48] <dreamcat4> because my previous question was never answered: does `go install ...` automatically update `go.mod` somewhere and add a list of requires each time i install a new tool (into that specific `$GOPATH`?

[21:10:13] <fizzie> If you're using `go install ...@latest` or some other version suffix, it will not modify any go.mod files anywhere, it'll just install what you asked into $GOPATH/bin.
[21:11:36] <dreamcat4> ok let's fast forward and assume that have now already migrated all my tools (by reinstalling them with `go install ...@latest` in this way
[21:12:10] <dreamcat4> can i then run a cmdline (or set of cmds) to check for updates and then update all those installed binaries to the new latest released version(s)?
[21:12:49] *** Joins: mrig (~mrig@user/mrig)
[21:14:05] <fizzie> Well, that part was my *very* speculative suggestion of using a module file to track the versions of what you want to have installed. But you'd put that go.mod file somewhere outside of $GOPATH, and give it some arbitrary name, and then run your `go list -u -m all`s and `go install`s (without a version suffix) in the context of that module, so they would update that go.mod file.
[21:14:09] <dreamcat4> the reason i am asking this is because (as discussed earlier) the command `go list -u` only applies to modules aparrently?
[21:14:25] <fizzie> That's not any sort of standard "flow" (as far as I know), but I also don't see why it shouldn't work either.
[21:15:25] <Tv_> dreamcat4: generally i would recommend you avoid installing anything globally, keep tools near & versioned by the project that uses them
[21:15:33] <dreamcat4> in other words, that is (create a modules file) the *only* way i can have my binaries be updated in any sane and reasonable fashion? or is it just duplicating another feature elsewhere of `go install ...` etc?
[21:15:49] <Tv_> most things can just `go run example.com/foo@v1.2.3 blah blah`
[21:16:07] <dreamcat4> hmm. that sounds good for certain tools
[21:16:15] <Tv_> with a `tools.go` to keep the go.mod addition of that persistent (and then actually drop @v1.2.3 from above)
[21:16:32] <dreamcat4> but not for all of my tools, other cmdline tools do in fact want to use globally
[21:16:47] <Tv_> sure, i wouldn't confuse those with development tooling tho
[21:16:47] <fizzie> I mean, if you just want to say "install the most recent versions of these tools globally", you can have a shell script that has `go install foo@latest; go install bar@latest` and run it to make sure it's all up to date.
[21:17:09] <fizzie> Doesn't give you a nice way of doing "list available updates" though.
[21:17:43] <Tv_> you can extract the used version from the executable, and use go list to see what @latest is now
[21:18:50] <dreamcat4> ok so assume the tool has been updated, and then `go install bar@latest` downloaded the new version. does that cmd automatically remove and cleanup the previous outdated version afterwards?
[21:19:20] <Tv_> the executable is overwritten, there is nothing else to clean
[21:19:32] <dreamcat4> hmm.
[21:20:25] <dreamcat4> this is not true? because in the example i gave earlier there is a whole src folder located on my disk at  `~/.go/pkg/mod/github.com/jingweno/ccat@v1.1.0`
[21:20:34] <fizzie> You might have some old versions of the code (and its dependencies) left in $GOMODCACHE (aka $GOPATH/pkg/mod), I don't know if there's a particular way to manage those.
[21:20:46] <fizzie> I mean, a drastic way to clean them up is to just empty the whole cache.
[21:21:50] <fizzie> (With `go clean -modcache`.)
[21:23:36] <fizzie> I doubt there can really be a "clean everything from the cache that's not referred to from anywhere", because in module mode Go doesn't have any sort of global list of all your modules. Though to be fair, I feel like other languages' equivalent things (Ruby gems, Haskell cabal things, ...) also just tend to grow to riduculous size over time.
[21:24:12] <Tv_> dreamcat4: that's a cache that has nothing to do with the installed executable
[21:24:22] <dreamcat4> so i should make a `go.mod` file for my tools manually then that could help me to automatically clean up the old versions?
[21:24:30] <Tv_> fizzie: what really sucks is that there's no pruning at all, apart from remove everything, at this time
[21:24:33] <dreamcat4> oh ok
[21:24:41] <dreamcat4> so maybe i could nuke the cache then. hmm
[21:25:07] <dreamcat4> (since they are cmdline tools, and standalone binaries)

[21:30:08] <fizzie> Tv_: I'd check $GOMODCACHE vs. ~/.stack vs. ~/.gem for comparative ridiculousness except I just had an unplanned disaster recovery test the other day (turns out if you're going to be deleting files recursively, ".." is not a good directory entry to follow) and those were excluded from backups. ;)

[22:03:44] <dreamcat4> fizzie so i tried your suggestion for creating a go module with a `tools.go` inside it...
[22:03:44] *** Quits: internut (~internut@2601:280:4e00:7b70:ac83:5f8b:da7e:d7b1) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:03:48] <dreamcat4> `tools.go:5:8: import "github.com/jingweno/ccat" is a program, not an importable package`
[22:04:08] <dreamcat4> doesn't work. so go really wants my to `go install ...` all commands / binaries instead
[22:04:35] <dreamcat4> which means ok i should do it that way then, and periodically blow away cache, etc.
[22:05:03] <fizzie> `tools.go` wasn't part of my suggestion, I just thought you'd have a go.mod file with require "github.com/jingweno/ccat" in it as a way of tracking the currently installed version, and providing a way to do that `go list -u -m all` thing.
[22:05:44] <Tv_> dreamcat4: import _ "blah"
[22:05:47] <dreamcat4> ah ok
[22:05:56] <fizzie> But yeah, it might have some gotchas, like if you don't actually have Go code that tries to depend on the module, something like `go mod tidy` would probably throw away the dependency.
[22:06:03] <Tv_> fizzie: without tools.go, tidy will remove the tool deps all the time
[22:06:32] <dreamcat4> `go mod tidy` DID remove and throw away the dependancy
[22:06:42] <Tv_> https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module
[22:07:33] <dreamcat4> lol, after adding the `import` it then added the dep of the program `ccat`

[22:08:07] <dreamcat4> so that's totally not what i wanted, to include allso all the dependancies of the list of binary  tools
[22:08:12] <dreamcat4> it's unworkable / untenable
[22:08:54] *** Joins: DogHackit (~nathanren@c-76-27-57-63.hsd1.ut.comcast.net)
[22:09:41] <dreamcat4> so the it seems like thing is.. `go` itself should be doing is maybe adding some kind of a mechanism to prune older versions deprecated by successive calls to `go install foo@latest`
[22:10:00] <dreamcat4> if it wants to do some kind of more rigorous pkg management duties. and not leave it in the hands of the user
[22:10:30] <dreamcat4> then maybe also build ontop of that a simple `update` command or something

[23:04:01] <mickey8> good idea.
[23:05:55] <mickey8> how would i cast an 50 to *int?
[23:06:47] <mickey8> or rather -2 to *float64
[23:07:03] *** Joins: DogHackit (~nathanren@c-76-27-57-63.hsd1.ut.comcast.net)
[23:07:27] <fizzie> `var f float64 = -2; ... &f ...` typically.
[23:07:52] <mickey8> yeah trying to avoid the multilines
[23:07:55] <fizzie> Or a `func foo(v float64) *float64 { return &v }` helper function.
[23:08:07] <mickey8> something like *float64.(-2) but that's wrong
[23:08:20] <fizzie> There's no single expression that you'd care to use.
[23:08:45] <fizzie> I'd mention the one there is but people would mock me about always bringing it up.
[23:10:36] <mickey8> ...
[23:10:46] <mickey8> it'd probably save me a dozen lines of code and some mess
[23:10:52] <fizzie> Well, if you insist: &(&[1]float64{-2})[0]
[23:11:01] <fizzie> If you prefer that, though...
[23:11:20] <Tv_> "trying to avoid the multilines" <-- don't play code golf
