[00:57:26] <Berlin36> aight
[00:57:59] <Berlin36> well i used some stack overflow's guy advice to use crypto/rand
[00:58:26] <Berlin36> it can create some pretty solid random numbers and then i seed it to math/rand

[01:00:09] <Berlin36> lol
[01:00:09] <Urchin[emacs]> ah, right
[01:00:31] <Urchin[emacs]> anyway, I think you should separate the key generation and encryption/decryption
[01:00:39] <Berlin36> oh, why?
[01:00:57] <Berlin36> text, key := otp("text")
[01:01:01] <Urchin[emacs]> the whole point of OTP is to prepare non-reusable keys and then be able to perfectly encrypt messages between two locations
[01:01:16] <Berlin36> and if you don't need one of them you can do _, key := otp("text")
[01:01:21] <Urchin[emacs]> you prepare keys on both locations so you can encrypt things at will
[01:01:39] <Urchin[emacs]> ah
[01:01:53] <Berlin36> yeah, go can just ignore one argument if you pass _
[01:01:58] <Urchin[emacs]> my Go knowledge has kind of evaporated
[01:02:10] <Berlin36> it's okay
[01:02:26] <Berlin36> i remember how i tried doing such thing in c++
[01:02:29] <Berlin36> returning two values
[01:02:46] <Berlin36> it was hell of a nightmare, idk why i needed that tho
[01:02:58] <Berlin36> so i did them separately, but it was messy
[01:03:39] <Urchin[emacs]> you should have a function that accepts the key and encrypts the message
[01:04:02] <Berlin36> how to store the key?
[01:04:11] <Berlin36> it is stored as a []rune in my function

[01:15:07] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: the thing is that usually the key has to be sent via a secure channel, usually generated on an air-gapped computer and only transported physically to the other person
[01:15:39] <Berlin36> Urchin[emacs]: so i need a otpGenKey function and a otpEncrypt function and also otpDecrypt?
[01:15:40] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: thing about OTPs is that they're pain in the ass to set up, but are perfectly secure once that's established

[03:09:31] <amigojapan> ?
[03:10:24] <omero> we should have a talk about what an heresy is, one of theese days
[03:10:36] <amigojapan> Sure
[03:12:05] <omero> for instance: having cappuccino around 12:00 after a bowl of ramen? that's it. thats heresy!
[03:13:31] <omero> but a cappuccino after having such a breakfast? perfectly normal.
[03:13:32] <amigojapan> I don't get it. Capuchino could releave the heavy feeling of the ramen
[03:14:44] <omero> you once asked me: ramen. for breakfast? I answered: why not.
[03:14:59] <omero> thats a good meal.
[03:15:33] <omero> ramen for breakfast. cappuccino after breakfast: perfect.
[03:15:45] <omero> its not heresy.
[03:16:15] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[03:16:37] <omero> now. suppose its 12:00 your time
[03:16:50] <omero> you eat ramen. and then... you order a cappuccino.
[03:17:44] <omero> you will trigger the SECRET POLICE HERESY SQUAD
[03:18:33] <amigojapan> Why
[03:19:11] <omero> you violated the sacred laws, amigojapan 
[03:19:49] <omero> I understand it doesnt make sense and I am just ... trying to explain ;)

[03:20:12] *** Quits: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[03:21:09] <amigojapan> No eating*
[03:21:12] <omero> heresy is about laws. religious laws. this is what I am kidding about, amigojapan 
[03:21:57] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[03:22:13] <amigojapan> Isn't that "sin" omero 
[03:22:15] <omero> see? I am not complaining
[03:22:26] <omero> its your fault after all :P
[03:23:19] <omero> if you want to pursue into the way of sin, who am I to stop you from walking that road...
[03:23:23] <amigojapan> You are so funny omero 
[03:24:23] <omero> Im just hungry... starving... its time for my spuntino ... and no, I wont consider a cappuccino after that
[03:25:25] <omero> cappuccino is best before... 12:00... oh sorry, thats 12AM... does makes sense if I say Before Noon?
[03:25:29] <amigojapan> Bon appetit omero 
[03:26:42] <omero> because cappuccino is relative to when you really wake up, have your breakfast. then you go out and do your stuff... it really depends on you and your cycle of life during the day. 
[03:27:23] <amigojapan> Yeah you won't be able to sleep if you have cappuccino at midnight
[03:27:30] <omero> consider splitting your day into periods.
[03:27:55] <omero> average splits? wedges, like an orange contains...
[03:28:11] <omero> a day say, is made up of 12 wedges
[03:28:22] <amigojapan> Like a pi chart?
[03:28:27] <omero> each measure your awake/sleep
[03:28:41] <omero> your body responds/tunes
[03:28:47] <omero> into those wedges
[03:28:50] <omero> yes.
[03:29:09] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[03:29:13] <omero> thus, having hotdogs for breakfast? nothing wrong with that
[03:29:40] <omero> having a cappuccino after the hotdogs? mmmm... ok... dangerous but still ok. 
[03:29:58] <amigojapan> Wow the laws are complex
[03:30:03] <omero> as long as that is your breakfast, you have time to 'process' that
[03:30:29] <omero> but ... dinner. that means ... approaching the time you are about to go sleeping
[03:30:37] <amigojapan> I am on my third cup of coffee by the way
[03:30:40] <omero> you have a dinner and then a cappuccino....
[03:30:45] <omero> wrong move.
[03:30:51] <amigojapan> I see
[03:31:08] <amigojapan> So no cappuccino before bed. I got it

[09:43:42] <Satin> gtklistview
[09:43:46] <Satin> and gtkfactory stuff
[09:43:56] <Satin> Wish I could do that and understand this stuff
[09:44:01] <Satin> And you know this is cutting edge
[09:44:06] <Satin> early 2020 GTK didn't have this stuff
[09:44:08] <Satin> They changed.
[09:44:09] <emmeka> it's just like - I'm basically a peasant, who can't code to save their life, and recently it seems like I'm actually more capable with linux than him
[09:44:15] <emmeka> how did this happen
[09:44:21] <MootPoot> because you use linux
[09:44:22] <MootPoot> and I dont
[09:44:24] <Satin> emmeka: coding doesn't make you good at linux
[09:44:35] <Satin> you're better at linux because you use it and you know the ins and outs more than he does
[09:44:44] <Satin> and that's fine, pooters shouldn't be hated on for his choice of OS
[09:44:46] <Satin> imo
[09:44:53] <MootPoot> all my academic and professional work requires windows
[09:44:56] <Satin> lots of discord users i've bumped into that are webdevs and such
[09:44:57] <jessedesu_onaph> I love edm music
[09:44:58] <MootPoot> I literally cant get by without it
[09:45:00] <Satin> only have server understanding of linux

[09:45:10] <Satin> blajh blah
[09:45:12] <ButterNoodle> the ins and outs of inboards and outboards.. an education in marine technology awaits you at ITT
[09:45:17] <Guest77> MootPoot I think libre office sort of deals with that on it's own.
[09:45:18] <Satin> lots of devs are on macos and vscode users
[09:45:22] <ButterNoodle> Satin: no bash?
[09:45:25] <Satin> yeah
[09:45:26] <Satin> idk why
[09:45:26] <Satin> LOL
[09:45:28] <Satin> powershell?
[09:45:30] <emmeka> Satin I mean logically I can accept that explanation, but somehow it feels wrong
[09:45:33] <Satin> microsoft azure
[09:45:34] <ButterNoodle> I mean its ez
[09:45:37] <Satin> yeaaaa
[09:45:50] <emmeka> I imagine all coders as Arch users
[09:45:59] <Satin> emmeka: i get what you mean lol, but that's the weird part, as culture changes and microsoft and other companies go into the space linux once held
[09:46:09] <Satin> ppl not required to be linux knowledgable as much
[09:46:13] <Guest77> Satin I only use powershell or command terminals when bored at work to look for wifi.

[09:46:43] <Satin> .
[09:46:48] <ButterNoodle> .
[09:47:04] <emmeka> ButterNoodle not as in I imagine all coding is done in Arch, but I inherently imagine all programmers as the sort of people who would install / be competent with Arch
[09:47:13] <jessedesu_onaph> Can you run gui on wsl
[09:47:14] <Satin> lol, if only emmeka
[09:47:17] <MootPoot> btw I saw emmeka run arch
[09:47:29] <MootPoot> I run arch too btw
[09:47:42] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: naa those arent mutually exclusive
[09:47:50] <jessedesu_onaph> Can you run a gui linux on wsl
[09:47:53] <Satin> emmeka: the dirty truth is many many many programmers don't know what they're doing entirely, tend to cobble together things, lots of google searches, stackexchange, only know js/react and so on
[09:47:57] <MootPoot> my car runs on arch
[09:48:04] <Satin> basic python
[09:48:09] <Satin> and can be hired even somewhere or the others
[09:48:11] <jessedesu_onaph> My motorcycle runs on 91
[09:48:12] <ButterNoodle> tbh its hard to find coders that understand simple networking
[09:48:15] <Satin> all i'm saying is the spectrum of programming is large
[09:48:17] <emmeka> MootPoot lies, I'm over here at the campfire with Linus Torvalds doing dnf upgrade --refresh
[09:48:22] <Guest77> Satin What about those programmers that rely on paraphrased copypastas?

[10:01:42] <MootPoot> yeah it had cute girls
[10:01:44] <MootPoot> thats it
[10:01:47] <Satin> no
[10:01:50] <MootPoot> I liked the otaku girl
[10:01:52] <Satin> the leadup was semi interesting
[10:01:54] <MootPoot> she was fun
[10:01:55] <Satin> the ending was 
[10:01:56] <Satin> eh
[10:01:59] <Satin> a failure
[10:02:06] <Satin> instead of capitalizing on the mysteriousness
[10:02:08] <Satin> of the whole thing
[10:02:10] <Satin> the seriousness
[10:02:21] <Satin> it just turned into another boring hurr durr wordl domination gotta stop it
[10:02:23] <Satin> cringefest
[10:02:36] <MootPoot> I've made a critical error 
[10:02:40] <MootPoot> I talked about anime in ##anime
[10:02:45] <Satin> .
[10:02:46] <Guest77> There isn't any real mystery that can be had regarding robotics. That's quantifiable. Best you can do is the drama.
[10:02:53] <Satin> that's not true guest
[10:03:04] <MootPoot> Can we have robot waifus?
[10:03:04] <Satin> read asimov shorts
[10:03:09] <MootPoot> trus mystery
[10:03:13] <Satin> a good writer can make even the most mundae of topics
[10:03:13] <MootPoot> Satin: COMMIE
[10:03:17] <Satin> draw attentiton to the interesting bits
[10:03:18] <Satin> no
[10:03:25] <Satin> issac asimov wasn't a commie
[10:03:27] <Satin> last i checked
[10:03:32] <Satin> ig he was born in russia but y'know
[10:03:33] <Satin> not a commie
[10:03:34] <Guest77> Are we going to discuss the pedantics and philosophy of the paradoxical nature of mathematics next?
[10:03:39] <Satin> ?
[10:03:42] * gh0s1 slaps Satin with a shark pillow
[10:03:44] <gh0s1> go to bed
[10:03:47] <MootPoot> No, we were going to discuss best girl
[10:03:50] <MootPoot> in robotics;notes
[10:04:05] <Satin> gh0s1:  i withdrew from all classes this semester, and i have no sleeping schedule to be obligated to
[10:04:08] <Satin> i'm up all night
[10:04:18] <Satin> i'll drive to missouri in a few days to get my phone and drivers licese and stuff
[10:04:20] <Satin> and then reset it again
[10:04:22] <Satin> for now tho nah
[10:04:33] <Guest77> Not going to do that at the moment, at work. Can't bother spoofing and installing shit on a corporate computer.
[10:04:53] <Satin> ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
[10:04:57] <Satin> you're not going to do what
[10:05:03] <Satin> you can't discuss best girl in robotics notes
[10:05:08] <Satin> without installing shit on a corporate computer?
[10:05:10] <Satin> what.
[10:05:13] <Guest77> Nothing.
[10:05:16] <Satin> weirdo
[10:05:22] * Satin stares 
[10:05:54] <MootPoot> I cant believe I forgot how to use PWM on a duino
[10:05:56] <MootPoot> its been so long
[10:06:10] <Guest77> Someone could always intercept DNS traffic and find out someone's been using the network to look for "Cute anime girls" in their spare time.

[10:08:16] <MootPoot> are you using IRC client
[10:08:19] <Satin> Probably
[10:08:26] <Satin> Yeah.
[10:08:31] <Satin> Maybe weechat plugin?
[10:08:35] <Satin> maybe a bash script
[10:08:36] <MootPoot> then I'd probably figure out if it takes any plugins there
[10:08:39] <Satin> that runs on linux always
[10:08:45] <MootPoot> and watch the process for spotify
[10:08:48] <Satin> like if i can just launch it via a keybinding

[10:09:31] <Guest77> ButterNoodle Wasn't that site shut down publicly and permanently?

[10:16:12] <Satin> MootPoot:  no
[10:16:36] <Guest77> MootPoot Can she smell it off of me, like old women with old spice?
[10:16:56] <Satin> no, i just know how indians think and type
[10:17:04] <Satin> and i partially grew up there
[10:17:07] <Satin> so of course i can tell 
[10:17:07] <Satin> LOL
[10:17:31] <Guest77> Satin It would be extremely funny if I wasn't indian and I just kept up the act.
[10:17:39] <Satin> it wouldn't
[10:17:59] <Guest77> Makes me curious, why do you think I'm indian?
[10:18:04] <Satin> I'm not going to say why
[10:18:14] <Satin> that's weird to voice my perceptions
[10:18:17] <Satin> and what drives my intutiton
[10:18:19] <Satin> i just know
[10:18:20] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle, Satin  I just remembered - https://www.amazon.com/Guacamaya-Hot-Sauce-Lime-Juice/dp/B075B142Y5/ this shit

[10:19:42] <Satin> it doesn't matter
[10:19:50] <Satin> you're free to be who you are, i was just saying that bit
[10:19:54] <Satin> i'm not trying to profile you or anything
[10:20:31] <Guest77> Satin So she says, the one assuming that I am.

[10:27:42] <MootPoot> satin is like the imperial colonizer trying to figure out which mixed blood person is of indian decent so she can send him back to the spice fields
[10:28:26] <MootPoot> btw Satin 
[10:28:29] <MootPoot> have you read dune
[10:28:32] <MootPoot> I watched the movie
[10:28:36] <MootPoot> thinking of buying it
[10:28:38] <Satin> ihavenot
[10:28:44] <Satin> it's a famous sci fi book
[10:28:47] <Satin> sagan probs has read it
[10:28:49] <Satin> ihavent
[10:28:54] <Satin> not the most natural of my genres
[10:29:03] <Satin> i've read more asimov than anything for my sci fi so far
[10:29:06] <Satin> and plan to read skinner
[10:29:20] <Satin> and a clockwork roange by anthony burgess etc
[10:29:23] <Satin> then maybe shit like dune
[10:29:39] <Satin> how was the movie?
[10:30:15] <MootPoot> it was your standard fare "kid loses dad then trial by fire to grow up deal" but the execution was pretty good
[10:30:30] <MootPoot> for having a trope-y synopsis I liked it at least
[10:30:41] <Guest77> Satin Which genres do you prefer the most? Classical, Sci-fi, Fantasy?
[10:30:54] <MootPoot> more then any of these other young adult kind of movies ( avengers, maze runner etc )
[10:30:58] <Satin> I don't care that heavily about genres rather than quality. 
[10:31:11] <MootPoot> but supposedly dune was the OG where all the others ripped off the tropes from
[10:31:13] <Satin> But I do think most good stuff are in the past, hindsight bias, filtered down to us etc
[10:31:15] <MootPoot> so it got reverse troped
[10:31:19] <Satin> and the great artists are in the past etc
[10:31:31] <Satin> so a lot of different periods of what some label "classical lit" mainly yea
[10:31:34] <MootPoot> people call dune tropey but everyone ( star wars etc ) just copied from them
[10:31:42] <Guest77> I prefer to judge them individually. Which sort of leaves me with a bias since I haven't really enjoyed much of any recently released books. Especially in the light-novel market as of late.
[10:31:43] <MootPoot> afaik
[10:31:47] <Satin> I currently have The Gate by Natsume Soseki sitting in my car, overdue but still
[10:31:55] <MootPoot> stop
[10:31:57] <Satin> Guest77: meh it depends on what you're looking for
[10:31:58] <MootPoot> more books
[10:32:01] <MootPoot> where
[10:32:03] <MootPoot>  nothing happens
[10:32:05] <Satin> if it's just entertainment
[10:32:12] <Satin> then a lot of light novels and what not
[10:32:14] <Satin> cheap fantasy stuff
[10:32:17] <Satin> do what you want it to
[10:32:30] <Satin> if you want to see actually "good" art, then there's a whole other set of books for that
[10:32:37] <Guest77> Satin Sadly, doesn't work that way.
[10:32:46] <MootPoot> sometimes I wonder why women even decide to get in relationships with men
[10:32:49] <Satin> The greats, from William Shakespherto myths and so on
[10:32:55] <Satin> MootPoot: there's a book for that too i bet
[10:32:56] <Satin> Kappa
[10:33:01] <MootPoot> instead of just losing their shit over cute girls
[10:33:05] <MootPoot> like the rest of us
[10:33:08] <Satin> dnrd
[10:33:11] <Satin> that's ur sexuality
[10:33:20] <MootPoot> If I was a woman I would be a lesbian
[10:33:32] <MootPoot> a futanari lesbian
[10:33:48] <Satin> :weird:
[10:34:02] <Guest77> Satin Ol' Willie doesn't cut it, most of his plays get rather boring. Character-heavy, yes. Interesting? Other than the intrigue and drama, nothing is there much to drive the mind of the common desensitized modern reader.
[10:34:19] <MootPoot> lol
[10:34:23] <MootPoot> Satin O Willie
[10:34:27] <MootPoot> that's her penname
[10:34:41] <MootPoot> the satin stained willie
[10:34:46] <Satin> Guest77: I'm not trying to disparage you but often you need the tools to appreciate good stuff as well sometimes
[10:34:53] <Satin> shakesphere is amazing with good context
[10:35:16] <Satin> that being said, for similiar reasons i often prefer modernist writers rather than plays and characters from further back in history
[10:35:16] <Guest77> Satin You mean copious amounts of alcohol? Been there and back again. Doesn't do much, sadly.
[10:35:24] <Satin> nope
[10:35:25] <Satin> i mean context
[10:35:35] <Satin> it can come from good books and people and experts like harold bloom
[10:35:38] <Guest77> I was joking.
[10:35:41] <Satin> or side-readers

[10:37:14] <Satin> but there's plenty of other things that are not shakey from that aera or further back too
[10:37:15] <Satin> there's faust
[10:37:17] <MootPoot> I s that wird
[10:37:22] <Satin> the canterbury tales and more
[10:37:28] <Satin> MootPoot: idk
[10:37:28] <MootPoot> oh
[10:37:31] <MootPoot> I think I've read that
[10:37:33] <Satin> we all have our quirks
[10:37:33] <MootPoot> the canterbury
[10:37:45] <Satin> i have read a little bit of it but not much
[10:37:47] <MootPoot> bullets, soda cans, AA batteries 
[10:37:59] <Satin> AA batteries
[10:38:00] <MootPoot> anything high in number and uniform - shiny too
[10:38:01] <Guest77> Regarding context, it is a mixed bag. Caesar for example, good to imagine but to study the actual empirical evidence and events during the day. Inaccurate.
[10:38:24] <Satin> idk where caesar comes into this convo but ok
[10:38:25] <MootPoot> Satin: I did read all of those 1000 nights or 1000 stories of arabia something

[10:38:42] <Guest77> Faust by Goethe was fun. But only a few times, can't really read it a few times and still be entertained.

[10:39:10] <Satin> it has its value

[10:40:00] <Satin> by who
[10:40:11] <Guest77> The book. The movie not entirely but it's quite fun.
[10:40:18] <Satin> ah
[10:40:18] <MootPoot> starship troopers was an antifa movie
[10:40:33] <Guest77> Heinlein.
[10:40:55] <MootPoot> I dont think I ever finished the grimms brothers stuff
[10:41:38] <Guest77> Can't we have like a ghetto-version of nursery rhymes?
[10:42:29] <Satin> i need to try to focus on this gtk stuff
[10:42:33] * Satin half zones out
[10:43:20] <MootPoot> Satin: you have to put on a schoolgirl outfit with sriped thighighs and do your hair into twintails
[10:43:24] <MootPoot> to focus right
[10:44:01] <Matt|home> i need something funny right the fuck now to distract myself

[10:51:48] <Satin> ya
[10:52:08] <Satin> you don't always need 100% historical accuracy or anything in works of art
[10:52:18] <Satin> as long as they don't pretend like they're trying to be accurate histories
[10:52:29] <Guest77> Guy discussed him being stabbed by his own council of croutons to preserve the democracy of the buffet.
[10:52:31] <Satin> you can find truths and wisdom in extrapolations and myths as well
[10:52:36] <Satin> you can find art in that
[10:52:44] <Satin> adaptions often do that

I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Zero Two’s tight dino pussy. I want her to suck all of my humanity out and ride me to death. Anyways, do you guys relate to this?

[13:42:56] <Llamamoe> PancakeMatsuri: Generally class 3 bites are due to the upper jaw being receded, not the other way around, and any jaw recession or narrowness reduce the volume of your upper airways.

[13:43:55] <Llamamoe> Which is rarely problematic while awake, but during sleep most of your airway muscles are relaxed, and ANY amount of flow resistance or collapse will induce abnormal autonomous nervous system modulation, leading to unrefreshing sleep and multiple-system dysregulation 
[13:45:33] <Guest77> Llamamoe I'm curious on your take on the concept of eugenics.

[13:47:34] <Llamamoe> PancakeMatsuri: if you want to have more energy, you need a BiPAP machine, and to work towards an actual permanent fix in the form of double jaw surgery and/or bone-borne palatal expansion. The only exception is if you have really severe turbinate hypertrophy in which case a reduction can help. Or using an air purifier to reduce congestion. In the meantime, sleep on your side or ideally belly(this needs special bedsheets), and purchase a
[13:47:34] <Llamamoe>  soft cervical collar that keeps your head slightly tilted back during sleep 
[13:48:04] <Llamamoe> PancakeMatsuri: This is probably the single most common cause of chronic mental health disorders, especially attentional, motivation, mood deficits
[13:49:09] <Llamamoe> IDK I do not want to go indepth on this because it's an obsession that consumes me 
[13:49:11] <Guest77> No comorbidity or any relevant causation?
[13:50:00] <Llamamoe> Guest77: It's caused primarily by anatomically narrow airways due to shit jaw development, and it takes very little to develop it relative to the normal human jaws because average human's jaws are already recessed and narrow. 
[13:50:43] <Llamamoe> Causes are primarily mouth breathing(due to congestion or habit), insufficient jaw muscle development, open mouth posture(due to mouth breathing or pacifiers), poor tongue posture(due to pacifiers) during childhood. 
[13:51:05] <Llamamoe> Probably. There's some heritable risk factors, but no idea what they are, and addressing the above issues can prevent development 
[13:51:11] <Guest77> Sure, but I'm more interested in the causes be it genetic or external.
[13:51:25] <Llamamoe> Sometimes it's possible to have it due to nasal congestion alone, or due to adenoid/tonsil hypertrophy
[13:51:33] <Llamamoe> But those usually occur secondary to jaw misdevelopment and not alone

[13:52:49] <Llamamoe> basically, look up celebrities with REALLY wide smiles and REALLY prominent jaws and perfect occlusion, that's what all humans should be at if they developed correctly 
[13:53:09] <Llamamoe> it takes a lot of deviation from that ideal to develop SDB but on average humans are BARELY above the "safe point"
[13:53:26] <Llamamoe> And they easily cross it when sick or congested or sleeping on their back 
[13:54:01] <Guest77> Llamamoe A bit weird don't you think? Fashion mags and similar seem to be in stark contrast to your description of correct.
[13:54:12] <Llamamoe> No idea what fashion mags say

[13:54:45] <Guest77> Pretty much, though it's noticeable.

[13:55:46] <Guest77> Llamamoe Just a followup but what's your take on cosmetic surgery regarding the anatomical functionality?
[13:56:17] <Llamamoe> I've seen people whose life was ruined by cosmetics surgeons unaware of the implications of jaw and nose on breathing

[13:57:21] <Llamamoe> And then a healthy human turns into a permanent wreck of themselves 
[13:57:25] <Guest77> Llamamoe Rhinoplasty is an extremely common cosmetic surgery procedure. Especially in south korea.

[13:58:01] *** Joins: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[13:58:03] <Llamamoe> Because that bump is caused by the upper jaw being receded 
[13:58:14] <Llamamoe> And it should be fixed by double jaw surgery 
[13:58:26] <Guest77> Llamamoe Or you know, they just 'feel' that it just doesn't look good enough.
[13:58:41] <Llamamoe> When you rhinoplasty it instead, you fuck up functionality because the front of the nose is already not projected sufficiently forward 
[13:59:03] <Llamamoe> Also face lifts
[13:59:05] <amigojapan> Guest77: that is too vane
[13:59:18] <Llamamoe> Most face lifts are because the jaws are too retruded to support the soft tissue and it sags 
[13:59:21] <Llamamoe> And should not be done 
[14:01:11] <Guest77> Llamamoe I'd agree if it was reconstructive surgery, especially from really bad accidents.
[14:02:04] <Guest77> Your poor ass-cheeks. Though it does give the term 'ass-face' a new meaning.
[14:02:28] <MootPoot> I want a girl to ass face me
[14:02:57] <Llamamoe> Guest77: Also tbh, 
[14:03:12] <Llamamoe> Nowadays like 70% of people develop sleep apnea when they're older
[14:03:30] <Llamamoe> I'd strongly recommend even pople who do not currently have sleep disordered breathing to do palatal expansion 
[14:03:47] <Guest77> Agree, pretty much. Comes from a garden variety concoction from genetics and level of activity.
[14:03:54] <Llamamoe> And ANYONE who has any sleep issues strongly needs to consider it 
[14:04:07] <Llamamoe> And awareness about factors that cause this shit in childhood needs to be raised
[14:06:09] <MootPoot> I got tested for it
[14:06:12] <MootPoot> negative for me
[14:06:18] <MootPoot> although it was a at home test
[14:06:34] <MootPoot> turns out it was just adhd and a carb-heavy diet lmao
[14:06:48] <Llamamoe> The at-home tests are 100% worthless. 
[14:07:00] <Llamamoe> There's three tiers of sleep disruption caused by breathing 
[14:07:22] <Guest77> There's restriction.
[14:07:31] <Llamamoe> 1) sleep instability due to abnormal autonomic modulation, 2) sleep fragmentation due to partial airway collapse, 3) oxygen desaturation due to really serious airway collapse
[14:07:51] <Llamamoe> Sleep studies only test for #3, and it takes severalfold less to cause #2, and again severalfold less to cause #1 
[14:08:08] <Llamamoe> Also the at-home ones are notoriously inaccurate and they underscore even #3 
[14:08:12] <PancakeMatsuri> Llamamoe thanks man
[14:08:22] <Guest77> Anyway, I'm out to get some food.
[14:08:38] <Llamamoe> To have ANY apneas or hypopneas, you need to be either a very severe case, or to have nerve damage that stops your body from waking up in order to keep breathing 
[14:08:53] <Llamamoe> And a lot of ADHD cases are probably caused by #1 and #2 
[14:08:57] <Llamamoe> I know mine is 
[14:10:56] <Llamamoe> We've got people in our community whose ADHD symptoms were fully reversed by stabilizing breathing during sleep to healthy norms

[15:46:21] <JesseDesu> you know, in real life, saying fuck you to a friend can effectively end that friendship
[15:46:56] <JesseDesu> also saying I hate you

[15:51:54] <MootPoot> but basically after a certain point, two people can shit on each other but have a deeper understanding that its all fun and games

[15:57:42] <Sadale> JesseDesu, cheer up! :3
[15:57:59] <MootPoot> think about it

[15:58:15] <MootPoot> and tell her
[15:58:16] <Sadale> I don't think people say fuck you while having sex
[15:58:18] <MootPoot> you're going to fuck her
[15:58:29] <MootPoot> you have to tell her "fuck you"
[15:58:36] <MootPoot> lots of fucking

[15:58:47] <amigojapan> 9:16 PM <JesseDesu> you know, in real life, saying fuck you to a friend can effectively end that friendship<---this likely depends much on tone of voice. I think MootPoot is joking but this may be lost they IRC
[15:59:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, Seriously is that how you describe having sex while you're talking to someone who you're about to have sex with? :O

[17:38:51] <MootPoot> Sadale: there was some ecchi talking going on here and I'm 99% sure it was this user who said something along the lines of "I cant take this, I'm out" and left
[17:39:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, 99% huh?
[17:39:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, was it in Libera or on freenode?

[17:39:23] <Sadale> weird. Could that be someone else?

[17:43:30] <JenniFurr> Lol, I figured you all might be interested in the sub forum, I like sharing my thoughts 😄
[17:44:00] <Sadale> hah. Too bad I'm a sub boy. Not a sub girl. And I'm more into femdom xD
[17:44:15] <MootPoot> femdom is in a weird spot imo
[17:44:25] <MootPoot> anything where the girl does *something* is somehow femdom
[17:44:33] <Sadale> And internet's full of man. I find a idea of making such a form to work out highly questionable.
[17:44:37] <JenniFurr> Bco1981 , AHEM! *SHE*

[17:45:04] <Sadale> ah. So JenniFurr's a she.
[17:45:10] <MootPoot> noted
[17:45:16] <ezekielnoob> if a girl is sucking you off.. is she the one dominating?
[17:45:27] <MootPoot> keep your cocks in your pants boys
[17:45:30] <MootPoot> the FBI is here
[17:45:35] <Bco1981> ezekielnoob: she will be if she bites
[17:45:40] <JenniFurr> ;)
[17:45:44] <Sadale> lol
[17:45:45] <ezekielnoob> i mean she's in control basically
[17:45:53] <Bco1981> ezekielnoob: exactly
[17:46:10] <ezekielnoob> she can also squeeze your balls out
[17:46:17] <MootPoot> sexy
[17:46:18] <Sadale> If she command you to eat her pussy while not letting you to fap nor cum, that's defo femdom. xD
[17:46:28] <JenniFurr> Yep
[17:46:36] <MootPoot> but somehow things like girl doing cowgirl is also femdom
[17:46:49] <MootPoot> if she does anything except lie there like a fish = femdom
[17:46:56] <Sadale> While she's at it she'd tie you up and kick you real hard on your balls time after time.

[17:52:54] <Sadale> lol
[17:53:17] <MootPoot> I'd pero pero cute girl butt
[17:54:38] <ezekielnoob> some girls like anal tho
[17:55:01] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, yo how many girls you've banged?
[17:55:11] * Sadale proudly says zero :D
[17:55:11] <MootPoot> ezekielnoob: are girls real
[17:55:18] <Sadale> (for himself)
[17:55:42] <Sadale> don't catch std xD
[17:56:25] <ezekielnoob> do hookers count
[17:56:52] <Sadale> Gimme two counts then. one with hookers, one without :P
[17:56:59] <Sadale> Here's mine. zero and zero xxD
[17:57:06] <MootPoot> I paid two hookers to cuddle
[17:57:14] <MootPoot> they liked it for some reason
[17:57:20] <MootPoot> I  paid them both for an hour
[17:57:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, wat? wow. I didn't expect that you've done such a thing
[17:57:34] <MootPoot> they both ended up staying with me for like 4 and 6 hours respectively
[17:57:50] <Sadale> Maybe it's more fun to be cuddled than to be banged?
[17:57:50] <MootPoot> Sadale: what, you actually thought I could get a real girl to cuddle with me
[17:58:00] <MootPoot> maybe but I paid for 1 and I got 6
[17:58:03] <ezekielnoob> it's for trhe sake of own sanity
[17:58:05] <MootPoot> they were really happy after
[17:58:07] <MootPoot> idk why
[17:58:10] <ezekielnoob> also i suppose it's a good preparation
[17:58:23] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm confused.
[17:58:40] <MootPoot> I guess they thought cuddle meant sex
[17:58:50] <MootPoot> butcuddle and chill was just cuddle and chill
[17:59:02] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean you actually pay someone just to cuddle them?
[17:59:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, like real girls
[17:59:06] <MootPoot> yes
[17:59:09] <MootPoot> I have
[17:59:10] <Sadale> I see.
[17:59:24] <Sadale> Alright. Time for me to convert myself into a girl and have MootPoot to pay to cuddle me :D
[17:59:25] <MootPoot> I dont think I have a chance otherwise
[17:59:26] <MootPoot> so might as well
[17:59:39] <ezekielnoob> Sadale i'll just say more than 5

[18:22:46] <MootPoot> Its weird when people automatically put the label spyware on  a thing for haivng a method of doing things to allow for a feature that benefits the user
[18:23:17] <Sadale> I mean Discord spy on all opened programs of the users.
[18:23:25] <MootPoot> why does it do that?
[18:23:27] <Sadale> The program name title and shit
[18:23:29] <MootPoot> do you know the reason?
[18:23:40] <Sadale> To show others what game you're playing, which I don't even want it to do so
[18:23:43] <Guest77> MootPoot It does benefit people. The developers and investors maybe?
[18:23:58] <MootPoot> you can just toggle it off,  Sadale , but there is a second reason
[18:24:02] <Sadale> I honestly don't want other people to know what game I'm playing in real time.
[18:24:06] <Bco1981> Sadale: play your eroge when not on discord.
[18:24:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, actually, it should be opt-in, not opt-out
[18:24:26] <Sadale> But they make it opt-out so that people would learn about this feature.

[18:38:47] <Guest77> And that's why you still have the old reliable blackmarket.
[18:39:19] <Sadale> Anyway most people in mainland China barely use any service outside the firewall.
[18:39:28] <Guest77> Well, the blackmarket exists when there are need for them. So technically they're still around everywhere in some form.
[18:39:31] <Poeticode> kind of nuts that over a billion people live over there
[18:39:50] <isekaijin> Is there some way to disable Google's newfangled 2FA nonsense?
[18:40:04] <Guest77> Poeticode You have thousands of policies that basically dictate that.
[18:40:25] <Sadale> isekaijin, get a burner phone number
[18:40:45] <Guest77> China already got rid of their 2 child policy. So they're pushing for something that prioritizes a bigger family.
[18:40:49] <isekaijin> It does not work. Gmail really asks me to confirm that I actually want to log in using my phone.
[18:41:06] <isekaijin> I would have not bought a phone if I had known I was buying into this shit.
[18:41:14] <Sadale> I think that the firewall is more about economy than politics tho. Quite a few of the blocked sites are those large corporations like facebook and google and shit
[18:41:15] <Guest77> isekaijin Remember that little incident a few years ago regarding the internet being free?
[18:41:38] <Sadale> The firewall blocks off the competitions. So that the domestic website can thrive.
[18:41:43] <isekaijin> Guest77: ?
[18:41:51] <MootPoot> isekaijin: you can use alternative 2FA methods - google auth, a FIDO2 key, etc
[18:41:57] <Guest77> isekaijin You have alternatives for gmail. A bit more secure like protonmail. And like everything nothing is a 100%
[18:42:02] <MootPoot> ^
[18:42:09] <MootPoot> but also 2FA SHOULD be mandatory
[18:42:27] <Sadale> isekaijin, oh if you're just talking about the 2FA token, there're alternative apps for that.
[18:42:36] <Sadale> isekaijin, the token generation software, right?
[18:43:01] <isekaijin> The real problem is that my workplace forces us to change passwords every few months or so. And, since our email system is integrated with Gmail, when we change our password, we get logged out of Gmail.
[18:43:13] <isekaijin> And now, here's the thing - I get logged out of ALL my email accounts, not just my workplace's.
[18:43:26] <MootPoot> and? log back in
[18:43:43] <isekaijin> Log back into 5 email accounts, each on three computers?
[18:43:54] <MootPoot> yes
[18:43:58] <zoidberg> nice Poeticode, how are you mate? howz the studies going?

[18:44:21] <MootPoot> or ^

[18:45:44] <Sadale> Guest77, I think it boils down to the cost and benefit. If you find that it's benefitial to get a dedicated phone, go ahead. It doesn't have to be a nice phone. It can be any el cheapo phone that works just well enough for work. Or it could also be your old phone.

[19:00:01] <Guest77> Sadale you have porn sites for that.
[19:00:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol true
[19:00:22] <zoidberg> wait, wait, would it be more pleasure with friction or without friction?
[19:00:29] <zoidberg> this is important!
[19:00:47] <Guest77> Bco1981 Are we really going to discuss thermodynamics and vector mechanics using sex as a medium?
[19:00:54] <Sadale> did someone said fucking air?
[19:01:01] <nym_> why not
[19:01:03] <zoidberg> hell yes,I would love to
[19:01:31] <Sadale> Bco1981, Tenga has an onahole product called "Air Tech".
[19:01:50] <zoidberg> Sadale: more like fucking compressed air, isn't it?
[19:02:05] <Guest77> Frictionless doesn't mean you won't feel anything, frictionless means that when you do a stroke with it. It goes through 'smooth'.
[19:02:08] <Sadale> I think the friction has to be just correct. Too much you can't slide. Too little you couldn't feel it.
[19:02:34] <Sadale> I guess that's not how you define frictionaless
[19:02:37] <zoidberg> I don't know which is good Guest77 
[19:02:39] <Bco1981> Sadale: sounds about right

[19:03:14] <zoidberg> Ideally I think some fleshy smooth friction through the walls of vagina would be pleasurable 
[19:03:38] <Sadale> Bco1981, if a man's cock is too small for a pussy I'm wondering if there's anything that could be done.
[19:03:49] <MootPoot> If you put a onahole into a vagina and then fuck the onahole
[19:03:52] <MootPoot> does that count as sex
[19:03:53] <Sadale> Bco1981, if it's too large, you could add lube. If it's too small tho, what to do?
[19:03:53] <Guest77> Friction does affect things like torque. But given if it's an external system influencing a closed system. You can just give yourself enough torque to make yourself move inside.
[19:04:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, first thing first, you can't easily fit an onahole into a vagina
[19:04:39] <MootPoot> Sadale: sounds like a challenge
[19:04:41] <Guest77> Sadale Depends, how large is the sex-sleeve?
[19:04:48] <zoidberg> where does torque come into play in sex Guest77?
[19:04:56] <Sadale> lol
[19:05:00] <zoidberg> torque is like turning force
[19:05:05] <Sadale> don't you rotate along your cock while having sex?
[19:05:09] <zoidberg> are there like turns in vagina?
[19:05:12] <Sadale> We do that all of the time
[19:05:16] <Guest77> zoidberg Have you ever had sex before?
[19:05:23] <zoidberg> nah Guest77 
[19:05:26] <Sadale> We rotate like a helicopter while having sex.
[19:05:31] <Guest77> Figures
[19:05:31] <MootPoot> 360 rpm
[19:05:32] <MootPoot> brrrrrrrrr
[19:05:46] <zoidberg> Guest77: I AM A VIRGIN!!
[19:05:52] <Sadale> I guess it's like a screw driver?
[19:06:00] <zoidberg> haven't yet lost my doutei
[19:06:10] <Guest77> Incidentally or preferably?
[19:06:15] <Sadale> So both the cock and the vagina are threaded
[19:06:28] <Sadale> To have sex you'd need to screw in and out
[19:06:35] <MootPoot> threaded NUT and bolt
[19:06:40] <Sadale> lol
[19:06:52] <zoidberg> well I wanted my first time with someone I love but that didn't happen Guest77 
[19:07:06] <zoidberg> Guest77: though I am not much of a looker, I look normal

[23:25:48] <Bco1981_2> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[23:26:18] <Bco1981_2> that fix does not help
[23:27:35] <Urchin[emacs]> why did you even need that?
[23:28:22] <Bco1981_2> tried OBS
[23:28:44] <Urchin[emacs]> OBS?
[23:29:09] <Bco1981_2> OBS wouldn't stream or record, so i looked at a forum that had install proceedur for it
[23:29:44] <Bco1981_2> since OBS loaded fine and showed the preview, i figured it was some coded issue, so i downloaded the ones in the forum guide
[23:29:59] <Bco1981_2> and they were older then the ones that already was installed
[23:30:16] <Urchin[emacs]> was it an old forum guide?
[23:30:32] <Urchin[emacs]> also, how are you connected, from where are you streaming to where, etc.
[23:31:13] <Bco1981_2> lan cable, 300mbit internet
[23:31:16] <Bco1981_2> to youtube
[23:31:34] <Bco1981_2> but that's not the issue. since it can't even record locally

[23:33:32] <Bco1981_2> and that's where i get the problem, yes
[23:33:41] <Bco1981_2> the file i installed was libfdk-aac1_0.1.4-2+b1_armhf.deb

[23:34:42] <Bco1981_2> if i don't use the file name... then how does it know which version i'm trying to uninstall
[23:34:53] <Urchin[emacs]> run dpkg --get-selections|egrep libfdk-aac
[23:35:57] <Urchin[emacs]> just uninstall them all for starters, and reinstall the one that comes from the repos
[23:36:50] <Bco1981_2> that's what i'm trying to do, but it won't let me
[23:36:59] <Urchin[emacs]> hm...

[23:38:38] <Bco1981_2> there tried the other one

[23:39:02] <Urchin[emacs]> you want it uninstalled for starters
