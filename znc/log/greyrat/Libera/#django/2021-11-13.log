[03:34:54] <WhyNotHugo> FunkyBob: It just makes sense for it to be the primary key too, especially since I often search for it using that.
[03:35:08] <WhyNotHugo> FunkyBob: Nothing wrong, but defining that at an app level seemed less repetitive.

[13:08:08] <soxfoxrox> I have a simple model with a number of Suggestions. Each suggestion has the number of Votes recorded with a timestamp.
[13:09:10] <soxfoxrox> Now I'm trying to show the number of votes per question per day.

[13:09:47] <soxfoxrox> But as you can see from the marked lines, I am using far too many queries to achieve my goal.
[13:10:38] <FunkyBob> you want to prefetch_related the Votes
[13:10:39] <FunkyBob> however
[13:10:59] <FunkyBob> you need to take the Votes query, annotate it with timestamp truncated to Day
[13:11:13] <FunkyBob> then count by day
[13:11:28] <FunkyBob> this should be able to bring your query count down to 2
[13:16:31] <soxfoxrox> FunkyBob, thanks. Just trying prefetch_related on "suggestions" just seems to bring the number of queries up from 1766 to 1767: https://dpaste.org/dTqC#L24,27
[13:17:43] <soxfoxrox> I am unsure about your count suggestion. I am using the Vote model to record the full number of votes per suggestion at different times (say suggestion 1 has 200 votes at 8:00 is one record, next record is suggestion 1 has 206 votes at 8:10).
[13:18:19] <soxfoxrox> That's why my thought was to subtract the minimum number of votes on a date from the maximum number of votes on a date.
