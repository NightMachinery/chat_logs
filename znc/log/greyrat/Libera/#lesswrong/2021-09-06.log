[00:06:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh can anyone access DSL?
[00:07:12] <Betawolf> yep
[00:08:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I get "server not found"... wtf
[00:09:03] <Betawolf> isn't it... your server?
[00:09:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, it's on NFSN's servers
[00:09:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the NFSN dashboard says everything's fine
[00:09:36] <Betawolf> seems to be here
[00:09:43] <Betawolf> could be a routing issue I guess
[00:09:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> DNS issue looks like

[01:29:38] <gwern> why are the chinese teslas so much worse? tesla not letting that gigafactory have the secret sauce because they'll just steal it?
[01:29:49] <rmmh> They use much less lithium / are safer / are cheaper, so probably a decent tradeoff

[01:38:15] <feepbot> <gwern> One way to deal with the synthetic data pollution issue would be for default sampling code / APIs to insert watermark at the beginning (upper-left of images, prefix of text). Then later models learn DT-style the conditioning as simply a 'genre' or 'style'. For images, NNs are so good at high-frequency 'non-robust' noise that the watermark could be quasi-steganographic so
[01:38:15] <feepbot> humans aren't bothered by it. It'll still function as useful conditioning for later models to avoid taking cruder models' quirks as representing reality.

[01:44:50] <|dbotdan> 10,000 Motivated Rats (@bombsfall, 2021-09-05 15:46): ‘Any discourse about art's power or importance in the world is inherently fucked by the past half century of liberal notions that making art about something is kind of the same as actually doing it. That writing a song about a revolution is basically like doing a revolution.’
[01:45:19] <gwern> I don't think 'propaganda of the deed' is going to work much better than propaganda of the word
[01:48:16] <saturn2> [revolting internally]
[01:48:48] <pompolic> programmer art is the truly revolutionary act then
[01:48:56] <adiabatic> "It's like expecting a sandwich to end racism. Actually that sounds like a commercial for a conscious food startup."
[01:49:26] <pompolic> Bacon Lettuce Mayo?

[01:50:55] <gwern> diversity is its flavor-strength
[01:52:07] <pompolic> what of Flavortown?
[01:52:14] <pompolic> is Guy Fieri trying to make an ethnostate?
[01:52:24] <saturn2> "if you ate a mouth-watering artisanal sandwich, would that end racism? would that end sexism? would that end discrimination against the lgbt community? no, but it would be only $3.99 for a limited time!"
[01:53:07] <adiabatic> $4 for an artisanal sandwich sounds like a pre-COVID price
[01:53:23] <saturn2> oh
[01:54:08] <saturn2> i haven't gone to a restaurant yet...
[01:54:21] <gwern> adiabatic: it's $4 for minorities. whites must make reparations by paying $20, to feel the weight of racism
[01:54:27] <Betawolf> eat, the rich.
[01:55:02] <adiabatic> saturn2: I barely go to restaurants. I'm just extrapolating based on the price bump I've seen for ground beef at the grocery store
[01:57:28] <rmmh> 30% off for interracial groups 
[02:02:40] <adiabatic> oh wow, I was used to $100–500 for (single) Jeopardy but on the original it was $10–$50
[02:05:20] <gwern> this is why you need automatic inflation adjustment everywhere
[02:05:45] <adiabatic> well, I noticed when my usual values doubled, but I didn't know how far back the game went
[02:06:10] <adiabatic> I was gonna make a joke like "that's like talking about a $500 clue on Jeopardy!" 
[02:07:23] <gwern> jeopardy is as old as dirt
[02:07:30] <gwern> trebek was a young man when it started
[02:08:34] <adiabatic> "Alex Trebek served as host of the daily syndicated version from its premiere in 1984 until his death in 2020,[49] except when he switched places with Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak as an April Fool's joke on April 1, 1997.[50]"
[02:08:37] <adiabatic> I wanna see these episodes
[02:12:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I remember that!!
[02:13:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> This was when my family would watch both Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune together, every day, religiously
[02:13:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> We'd all gather in the living room and eat dinner in front of the TV and watch game shows
[02:13:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like real Americans
[02:13:36] <saturn2> wow
[02:13:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yeah I totally remember the crossover episodes
[02:15:45] <rmmh> The Americans
[02:15:57] <rmmh> wheel of fortune is so lame compared to jeopardy
[02:16:08] <rmmh> like... hangman vs crosswords
[02:16:14] <meowcat> o/~ Yet Robin Hooding isn't the solution / The powers that be, must be undermined where they dwell / In a small exclusive gourmet institution / Where we overcharge the wealthy clientele
[02:17:46] <meowcat> (By the end of RENT, even Collins is into gentrification.)
[02:17:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> I agree that Wheel of Fortune is way more lame
[02:18:51] <saturn2> the other half of the bell curve watches TV too
[02:18:58] <gwern> yeah, the mean IQ of wheel of fortune and jeopardy watchers must be like a SD different
[02:19:16] <meowcat> oh, i figured there was one candidate pool and they were partitioned for the two shows
[02:19:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, you guys mock Wheel of Fortune, but
[02:19:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's great for improving your vocabulary
[02:19:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> When you're a recent immigrant
[02:20:05] <adiabatic> I was gonna ask if it's good for that
[02:20:15] <meowcat> but making it explicitly ESL would probably come across as patronizing
[02:20:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well yeah
[02:20:41] <meowcat> it's like snuggies.  snuggies are great for wheelchair users.
[02:20:45] <saturn2> it's funny that i'd instantly recognize alex trabek but i had no idea who pat sajak was
[02:20:48] <gwern> I wouldn't say it's *good*. wheel of fortune is *so* slow. and uses many common words. but it's possibly better than however else a recent immigrant might choose to spend their entertainment time?
[02:20:59] <saturn2> even though i've definitely seen both shows multiple times
[02:21:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It's a fine family activity
[02:21:12] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: oh yeah as ESL most any input is useful
[02:21:23] <gwern> (jeopardy would be terrible unless you were sitting there pen in hand jotting down everything to look up later)
[02:21:26] <rmmh> (any input you care enough to pay attention to)
[02:21:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah, you market it to stupid Americans, which is the equivalent of marketing it to children, because Americans are kind of like children in general

[02:24:02] <meowcat> bob barker reminding you to have your pets spayed or neutered.
[02:24:02] <gwern> I have to say, life as an ESL must be vastly easier now. you have closed captions consistently on everything, you can look up any word instantly online, you can subscribe to endless vocab building services like AWAD, spaced repetition has been popularized (and if there is anything spaced repetition works perfectly for, it's memorizing vocab), you have all sorts of text-heavy services like...

[02:24:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Barker! Yeah
[02:24:08] <gwern> ...twitter or free online newspapers to incentivize reading, you have google translate for quick free consultations which don't embarass you by asking your few native friends embarassingly childlike questions for the nth time that day...
[02:24:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> What a perfect name for a game show host, eh
[02:24:22] <rmmh> gwern: you can also make an online microcommune of expats and not learn english :v
[02:24:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> And Rod Roddy the announcer
[02:24:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I didn't get to watch Price is Right as often, but
[02:24:47] <adiabatic> gwern: "look up words instantly online" makes reading Spanish way easier compared to when I had to use a paper bilingual dictionary

[02:25:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wonder what Vanna White looks like nowadays
[02:25:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> She must be approaching 70

[02:39:28] <catern> I got to ride alone in a self-driving car last week, was pretty cool
[02:39:49] <catern> since I was visiting the part of Arizona where Waymo's test area is
[02:40:09] <ivan> catern: were you alone
[02:40:16] <ivan> (without a human safety driver)
[02:40:17] <catern> ivan: yes
[02:40:19] <ivan> oh neat
[02:40:47] <pompolic> you know what else loves boosting low-probability events? anxiety
[02:40:56] <pompolic> really makes me think sometimes
[02:40:58] <catern> just used the app and it drove right up, just like Uber/Lyft. the future is now
[02:41:15] <catern> (drove up empty, drove away empty)
[02:41:27] <meowcat> pompolic: getting many people's anxiety synchronized is how you get moral panics, qanon, antivax movement, etc.
[02:42:07] <adiabatic> meowcat: also some flavors of Trump Derangement Syndrome
[02:42:14] <meowcat> or the video game violence thing, heavy metal suicide, bothered about dungeons & dragons, jazz music is the devil
[02:42:38] <meowcat> adiabatic: i think maybe that term can wait until the prosecutions for attempting to murder congress are done :)
[02:42:58] <pompolic> oh i thought the partisan valence was a failed prediction of my politics

[02:43:56] <meowcat> i dunno, i was in middle school when the berlin wall came down, that was kind of a big deal
[02:45:43] <meowcat> it sucks that americans can also be riled up into being literally fascist revolutionaries actually trying to hunt down and murder legislators, but that actually happened :(

[02:46:39] <adiabatic> o shit nigga u serious
[02:47:07] <pompolic> trying to remove Bad Things from video games has more fascist DNA while we're at it

But it turns out that the people who predicted that were correct, and the people who predicted not-that were in error.  So we should drop the expression.
[02:52:22] <adiabatic> meowcat: what I saw was little more than a barely-directed self-guided tour with some random dead cop (Sicknick) from natural causes, a dead-by-cop protester (Babbitt), a couple random boomer protesters who got heart attacks and died, and…a media complex trying to hype this up into Timothy McVeigh 2.0

[02:57:05] <pompolic> man, the point about anxiety was less boring
[02:57:20] <pompolic> in my experience with anxiety, my brain applies an implicit heuristic
[02:57:32] <pompolic> "because i'm thinking about this, it's worth paying attention to it"
[02:57:56] <kuudes> that sounds like a reasonable prior but not always :-/
[02:58:31] <meowcat> "if i didn't think this was important, i'd be thinking something else instead!"
[02:58:35] <pompolic> i think it's a reasonable prior iff one is not good at generating black swan events
[02:59:10] <kuudes> 5g could work for remote driving

[03:04:38] <kuudes> yes, in usa
[03:04:45] <kuudes> sorry
[03:06:39] <pompolic> i dunno, i think geography exists everywhere
[03:06:53] <adiabatic> in some places you can ignore it
[03:07:34] <kuudes> if you can just put base stations to wherever you spot a dead spot, then you don't have dead spots anymore
[03:08:17] <saturn2> but spotting a dead spot with remote driving would mean people have been killed
[03:08:25] <kuudes> like over here, if landowner complains that they don't want a base station somewhere, the telco can ask the comms office to decide where to put it and where to draw the wires and they must decide it within 14 days, and then that route must be used
[03:08:38] <kuudes> saturn2, you have specific cars to check for reception
[03:08:56] <kuudes> ie similar thing as with google streetview cars, but for signal strength
[03:09:06] <kuudes> this is 99s tech
[03:09:19] <kuudes> or was it 01, I don't remember
[03:10:05] <kuudes> also use the same base stations for multiple telcos
[03:10:14] * gwern is a little surprised he doesn't recall ever hearing of _eX-Driver_
[03:12:07] <kuudes> mobile comms are perfectly solveable stuff, but in many locales they were treated as rich people luxury items to be taxed luxury taxes instead of everyday infra stuff like drinking water
[03:12:21] <kuudes> and in usa...
[03:12:27] <kuudes> meh
[03:12:42] <adiabatic> here, we have places where it's not worth it to run particularly good comms
[03:12:56] <adiabatic> and it's kind of in fits in starts
[03:13:24] <adiabatic> at least in Australia there's a bigger distinction between useless land (the middle) and the populated parts (islands of people on the periphery)
[03:15:06] <kuudes> we have coverage also on the sea and in the wilderness of lapland
[03:15:21] <kuudes> finland has less than 16 persons per km²
[03:16:09] <saturn2> i kind of wish usa had less mobile comms infrastructure
[03:16:30] <adiabatic> So you could go places and be, like, "sorry, no internet here"?

[09:34:21] <adiabatic> rmmh: rainbow parens is kind of old hat at this point
[09:37:43] <kuudes> I wonder would it be useful for a language to use {[( for same purpose but so that you would need to close same with same?
[09:38:13] <kuudes> ie {(a,b),c} would be ok but {(a,b},c) would not be ok
[09:38:51] <kuudes> especially lisp style () language could benefit? or would that be against its premise?
[09:39:07] <adiabatic> I suspect nobody does that because it's so darn useful for (, {, and [ to mean different things
[09:39:49] <adiabatic> if _I_ made a lisp I would strongly consider that and just use [[[[ everywhere, but lots of europeans who don't have [ on their keyboards would probably hate it
[09:40:19] <adiabatic> the next version of Go with generics is gonna use () instead of <> for types and there's some wailing and gnashing of teeth
[09:40:52] <kuudes> indeed
[09:41:04] <kuudes> <> as brackets is sort of odd
[09:41:26] <adiabatic> the French use «»
[09:41:42] <adiabatic> there's also ‹› as well
[09:41:46] <kuudes> heh, I don't have those in my keyboard I suppose
[09:41:50] <saturn2> {(a,b},c) is already not ok in any language i know
[09:42:20] <adiabatic> well, there's [a, b) which is spelled [a, b[ in Europe
[09:42:22] <kuudes> saturn2, yeah, but {(a,b),c} would equal to ({a,b},c)
[09:42:33] <saturn2> oh i see what you mean
[09:42:49] <kuudes> the point would be to use {[( for sort of parity check
[09:43:07] <kuudes> ie in long math formulas that is already in use
[09:43:50] <kuudes> ie function(innerfunction(evenmoreinnerfunction(yetanother(waitwherewasI))?
[09:43:51] <saturn2> lisp programmers normally use an editor that manages the parens automatically, so this seems like a step backwards
[09:44:06] <kuudes> yeah, I could presume they have already solved it otherwise

[10:19:56] <feep> adiabatic: german keyboard has [] on a wristbreaking backwards combo
[10:20:03] <feep> that every programmer gets used to anyways :/
[10:20:24] <feep> but anyway, ya'll are wrong about lisp, just make [...] mean (list ...)
[10:20:47] <kuudes> over here it is altgr+8 and altgr+9 for [ ]. which is logical as () are shift+8 and shift+9
[10:20:48] <feep> make the c weenies happy~
[10:20:54] <feep> kuudes: yes, same in german
[10:21:10] <feep> the problem is 8 is way further left than alt-gr but alt-gr is a right thumb key
[10:21:20] <feep> but they're still both right-hand keys
[10:21:40] <feep> so you end up having to put your thumb on alt-gr and then sort of roll over your entire hand so you can reach the 8
[10:21:55] <kuudes> yeah
[10:22:07] <feep> kuudes: anyway, that's why I have bound alt-gr to caps lock~
[10:22:26] <kuudes> I guess switching altgr and alt could do it as well?
[10:22:37] <feep> yeah but you need alt, you don't need capslock.

[18:27:05] <rsaarelm> Yeah, the stuff about Lisp as the secret weapon seems to have not fared so well past 2000.
[18:27:13] <rsaarelm> It probably did make sense before that.
[18:27:47] <rsaarelm> Like, I learned to program around 1994 or 1995, but literally had not encountered hash tables until I did some Perl scripting for some reason in 1999.
[18:28:03] <rsaarelm> And I remember going "hey what's with these weird arrays you can index with anything, this is really handy"
[18:29:43] <rsaarelm> I think you have to be in pretty deep before the whole DSL thing everybody says is so great about Lisp starts paying off, and even then it's entirely up to you whether you make something good or a leaking sieve of a kludge.

[19:35:11] <kuudes> yo, all
[19:35:38] <kuudes> I have started to ponder if it would be altruistic for finland to try to get herd immunity by vaccination, even though it is impossible in elsewhere
[19:35:52] <kuudes> over here it seems possible that we will get to >90% vaccine prevalence
[19:36:19] <kuudes> which means that it is possible, with effective enough vaccination schedule, to get infection herd immunity to up to R<=10
[19:36:39] <kuudes> whereas in other places, where vaccination prevalence will stay under 80%, the max R will be at most 5
[19:36:54] <kuudes> which means delta will not be got herd immunity against elsewhere
[19:37:32] <kuudes> which means that if covid gets endemic, every year about 3x current flu deaths will die to covid
[19:38:20] <kuudes> but. if we had at least 1 locale, which managed to get herd immunity through vaccines, I would think that would be good evidence which could make it reasonable for other locations to try to figure out if that can be replicated
[19:38:49] <kuudes> therefore, I am pondering if it would be altruistic to try to get herd immunity through vaccines in finland
[19:38:51] <kuudes> inputs?
[19:39:21] <two2thehead> how did you calculate that k?
[19:39:36] <two2thehead> that r, I should say
[19:40:58] <kuudes> the formula for herd immunity is 1 > (1-1/r)/ep, where r is R of the disease, e is effectiveness of vaccine, p is vaccinated population fraction

[19:42:34] <two2thehead> I don't think I've ever seen that formula before
[19:43:36] <two2thehead> " The formula for calculating the herd-immunity threshold is 1–1/R0 — meaning that the more people who become infected by each individual who has the virus, the higher the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to reach herd immunity. For instance, measles is extremely infectious, with an R0 typically between 12 and 18, which works out to a herd-immunity threshold of 92–94% of the population. For a virus that is less infec
[19:43:36] <two2thehead> tious (with a lower reproduction number), the threshold would be lower. The R0 assumes that everyone is susceptible to the virus, but that changes as the epidemic proceeds, because some people become infected and gain immunity. For that reason, a variation of R0 called the R effective (abbreviated Rt or Re) is sometimes used in these calculations, because it takes into consideration changes in susceptibility in the population."
[19:44:28] <kuudes> yes
[19:44:36] <two2thehead> kuudes, refresh my memory, does Finland have national ID cards?
[19:44:50] <nshepperd2> sure, it would probably increase political pressure elsewhere to give a crap about vaccination if there was a success case other than china
[19:44:57] <kuudes> thanks nshepperd2

[19:45:48] <two2thehead> ah
[19:46:08] <kuudes> I have been considering that Israel would otherwise be the prime choice, but they don't seem to have high enough vaccine prevalence
[19:46:14] <two2thehead> I was going to see how best to estimate vaccination rates, and a national ID database would help a bunch
[19:46:16] <kuudes> as they have something aroudn 60%-70%
[19:46:24] <two2thehead> with regards to your question, probably
[19:46:43] <kuudes> we have population registry and patient data registry, sure
[19:47:00] <two2thehead> If x country has 90% vaccination rate, then that will almost certainly be a 'selling point'

[19:48:28] <two2thehead> \O/
[19:48:45] <kuudes> it seems very possible we will get at least 90% uptake
[19:48:52] <two2thehead> there's also an element of competition, which I've not seen mentioned elsewhere, wrt vaccination rate
[19:48:59] <kuudes> polls would indicate over 95% but people may get lazy
[19:49:10] <two2thehead> oh, I remember this.
[19:49:31] <kuudes> for measles we have >97%, so we have vaccine based herd immunity for it in finland but in specific antivax locales

[19:59:24] <nshepperd2> we'll probably reach a useful level of vaccination in several months when the next variant has come and gone
[20:00:19] <pompolic> something that sticks out to me, is that this article is pre-vaccine
[20:01:08] <kuudes> yes. I presume countries will move to "vaccinate as much as possible, then herd immunity with infections"
[20:01:35] <kuudes> the other options are the finland-option I proposed earlier and new zealand-option of keeping borders closed

[20:02:26] <nshepperd2> vaccinate until you get tired, then have a lie down and let the virus become endemic
[20:02:31] <kuudes> notice how in all those other countries daily vaccine uptake has at a point dropped sharply. in finland, the pace is still constant at the about 1% per day which is the par
[20:02:55] <kuudes> two2thehead, vaccinate enough people multiple times to get vaccine effectiveness >90% and vaccine prevalence >90%

[20:57:06] <feep> I just wanted to add a field to a struct...
[20:57:28] <pompolic> my understanding of rationals is that they just store the...help me out of the terminology
[20:57:33] <pompolic> denominator and the other one
[20:57:36] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern, I recall you would dump quotes in your SRS system

[20:57:40] <pompolic> ty
[20:57:47] <pompolic> can't believe i blanked on that
[20:57:47] <RiversHaveWings> as bigints
[20:57:56] <PapuaHardyNet> now quotes are pretty much the exact opposite of the gold standard for SRS flashcards, aka QA pairs
[20:57:56] <pompolic> ok, so pretty much what i thought
[20:58:09] <PapuaHardyNet> did you eventually give up on dumping quotes in your system or do you still do it
[20:58:18] <pompolic> when you divide them, the division will still be using a fixed size representation, no?
[20:59:39] <RiversHaveWings> no
[20:59:49] <pompolic> oh ok
[20:59:52] <RiversHaveWings> it preserves all the information
[20:59:59] <RiversHaveWings> the bigints just get bigger
[21:00:06] <RiversHaveWings> if you are unlucky in the calculations you do
[21:00:19] <pompolic> then i don't think you're restricting yourself from anything, but it can probably get a lot slower
[21:00:23] <RiversHaveWings> ok but
[21:00:43] <RiversHaveWings> if you want to compute a function that takes a rational as input and can output things that are not rationals.
[21:00:47] <RiversHaveWings> you just cannot do it.
[21:01:03] <pompolic> ah, so you are defeated by the type system
[21:01:07] <RiversHaveWings> you have to choose what precision you want and then you aren't doing infinite precision anymore.
[21:01:40] <RiversHaveWings> idk i think different rational libraries handle these in different ways but it is a fundamental limitation
[21:01:50] <pompolic> yeah sounds like it
[21:01:58] <RiversHaveWings> unless you go full symbolic computation graph and do all your operations on computable reals
[21:02:12] <RiversHaveWings> which is *even more* expensive
[21:02:57] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: I enjoy quotes

[21:04:12] <pompolic> are you sure? i saw internal registers going higher (but those aren't exposed to the user)
[21:04:41] <RiversHaveWings> maybe
[21:05:16] <RiversHaveWings> idk what the accumulators use
[21:05:20] <pompolic> to the extent i recall my numerical methods class, there are better and worse points to perform the division
[21:06:15] <pompolic> so i think you could, in theory, have heuristics to minimize numerical error i suppose
[21:06:36] <pompolic> which brings us back to "look what they need to do to mimic a fraction"
[21:06:38] <RiversHaveWings> yeah.
[21:07:53] <RiversHaveWings> "Computable reals however do not form a computable field, because the definition of a computable field requires effective equality." oh yeah this lol
[21:07:55] <nshepperd2> the big-O of rational number arithmetic is unpredictable and often bad because of the increasing bigints problem
[21:08:09] *** Quits: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide) (Quit: oxide)

[21:08:36] <RiversHaveWings> (You can check if they're equal to any desired finite precision)
[21:08:41] <feep> computable reals over computable feels
[21:09:08] <RiversHaveWings> But to actually determine if they're equal you have to be able to determine if two arbitrary Turing machines have the same output.
[21:09:14] <nshepperd2> equality is semidecidable yeah
[21:10:00] <nshepperd2> the libraries always have a been red warning on the comparison definitions saying 'this might randomly hang your program, good luck!'
[21:10:33] <RiversHaveWings> yeah.
[21:10:40] <RiversHaveWings> Ordering too
[21:11:02] <pompolic> oh no the halting problem again
[21:13:14] <RiversHaveWings> imagine trying to do gradient descent w/ rationals
[21:13:36] <nshepperd2> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exact-real-0.12.5/docs/Data-CReal.html implemented a variable precision datatype where intermediate calculations are computed to whatever precision to allow the given final precision

[21:17:23] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[21:17:24] <nshepperd2> like compute more digits
[21:17:27] <RiversHaveWings> i see
[21:19:03] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: so you want some regularization to constrain parameters to be float-ish and have few significant digits after each update is applied? sounds like you could just truncate after calculating the gradient

[22:56:48] <rsaarelm> I think I had the concept of ladder of "go to university, learn math and physics, become professional researcher".

[22:57:16] <PapuaHardyNet> so you pivoted during uni?

[23:06:56] <ggreer> I read most of the posts and it looks like it could explain any outcome. timing doesn't match up? oh the compounds take decades to accumulate. some states banned the compounds and had no effect on obesity? oh uhh... people there must still get lots of contaminants from stuff shipped from out of state. anorexia also skyrocketed at the same time? uhh... paradoxical reaction

[23:12:01] <nshepperd2> as i recall they said they banned the PFOAs or whatever and they just switched to related chemicals that are basically the same but shorter
[23:14:59] <ggreer> it can't be PFAS because some places have banned PFAS and their obesity rates haven't changed. also those compounds are very inert (that's why they're used in firefighting foam) so it's not clear how it'd change anything in the human body
[23:15:19] <ggreer> and you'd think you'd see more of a correlation between PFAS serum levels and obesity

[23:20:05] <ggreer> also the author brings up new data only when it supports a contaminant but doesn't reference those same bits of data when it means a contaminant is unlikely. eg: desalination gets water from the ocean. but he only mentions that in the lithium section (because sea water has more lithium than most other water sources) but not in the PFAS section (I'm guessing because ocean water has almost no PFAS)
[23:21:16] <ggreer> or saying "PFAS has been detected at military sites in 49 states" like... ok? that means we have very sensitive detection mechanisms
[23:21:39] <ggreer> and links to a map showing lots of PFAS in colorado, the state with lowest obesity
[23:21:45] <nshepperd2> i see
[23:22:37] <ggreer> also he says the timing matches up, but the timing totally doesn't match up
[23:23:08] <ggreer> > PFAS were invented in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, and were rolled out over the next couple decades. This gave them some time to build up in people’s bodies and in the environment. By the 1980’s many types, including some new compounds, were in circulation. In the 2000s, some of them began to be banned, but many of them are still widely used.
[23:23:28] <ggreer> I could use the same logic to prove that obesity was caused by removing lead from gasoline
[23:24:39] <nshepperd2> sure, the PUFA people have the same logic
[23:25:27] <galambo__> hi
[23:25:32] *** galambo__ is now known as galambo
[23:25:37] <nshepperd2> there's a lot of things that started existing in the mid 20th century. it's pretty poor evidence
[23:27:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why don't we just blame the Nazis
[23:27:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> They started existing in the mid 20th century and were definitely evil
[23:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Case closed imo
[23:29:16] <nshepperd2> does that mean our society is rife with hidden nazi contamination
[23:29:21] <nshepperd2> sounds bad
[23:29:23] <ggreer> my guess is that we won't find a smoking gun and we'll eventually fix the obesity problem with drugs
[23:29:35] <mst> I mean my parents also started existing in the mid 20th century
[23:29:39] <RiversHaveWings> which drugs?
[23:29:41] <mst> ggreer: it's called amphetamine
[23:29:53] <RiversHaveWings> that only has a mild effect though?
[23:29:55] <mst> though they weren't evil except for the part where they're responsible for me existing
[23:30:16] <Gurkenglas> RiversHaveWings, sounds like a dakka problem.
[23:30:21] <ggreer> probably something like semaglutide
[23:30:33] <RiversHaveWings> Gurkenglas: you... can do this, but usually you gain it back
[23:30:48] <RiversHaveWings> when you stop taking the super high doses of amphetamine
[23:30:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not if you die first
[23:30:56] <Gurkenglas> there is one obvious solution here

[23:39:48] <nshepperd2> the only smoking gun would be if you did an experiment involving somehow removing each contaminant found in blood one at a time
[23:40:36] <nshepperd2> without changing anything else

[23:46:50] <gwern> nshepperd2: well, you could add contaminants
[23:47:06] <gwern> adding is a lot easier than selectively removing
[23:47:15] <RiversHaveWings> shawwwn: oh no
[23:47:22] <gwern> is that unethical? well, it's only unethical if the theory is right!
[23:47:37] <rmmh> " When I was in college, many (many!) years before cellphones, and before personal computers, I went to see my undergraduate advisor. Oh no, a long line of students outside his office! Looks like over an hour wait. So I had a brilliant idea: I trotted back to the dorm and called him on the phone. He picked up on the first ring, and I got to ask him what I needed to while everyone else waited."
