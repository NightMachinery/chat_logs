[02:48:32] <tjcarter> One of the biggest things that leads me to use Cinnamon is that I can pretty much rebind all of the keys, and full screen magnifier.

[02:49:53] <tjcarter> Cinnamon runs on relatively pretty old and low-spec hardware surprisingly decently well (including my Raspberry Pi 4s), but it's a little slow to start up and it's got too many moving parts that can break too easily.
[02:50:22] <tjcarter> But it's got that magnifier that Just Works, and works right unlike Gnome's.

[03:56:39] <somiaj> how much ram do you have total?
[03:57:01] <somiaj> it sounds like you don't hvae that much swap free, it could be it isn't enough to hold our ram so you can hibernate, but you might be able to suspend
[03:57:20] <somiaj> also what is the output of 'free -h'
[03:57:22] <Khepra> also: is it a swapfile, and can a swapfile be used for hibern?
[03:57:31] <incal> 'sudo lshw -short -c memory | \grep -i system' says I have 16GiB
[03:57:35] <jkc> A swapfile CAN be used for hibernation, but it takes a good bit more setup.
[03:57:47] <jkc> Also dependent on the underlying filesystem.
[03:58:18] <jkc> Though that latter concern is usually more one of "does that fs support swapfiles at all?" than it is specifically about hibernation.
[03:58:23] <incal> free -h says total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available / Mem:            15Gi       754Mi        12Gi        15Mi       2.1Gi        14Gi / Swap:          976Mi       738Mi       238Mi
[03:58:47] <jkc> You are never going to be able to hibernate a system with 16GiB RAM in a sub-1GiB swap space.
[03:58:58] <somiaj> so you have 15gigs of memeory but only 238Megs of swap free, you can't hibernate in that

[04:46:46] <greycat> which(1) just searches your $PATH.
[04:46:53] <willow> do i need to reorder PATH?
[04:47:14] <somiaj> does it matter? On your system they are both available to use.
[04:47:16] <willow> hmm.  seems like usrmerge should also reorder PATH as part of the update process
[04:47:36] <greycat> How would it do that?  Why would it do that?
[04:47:46] <greycat> Your PATH is yours.  You're setting it in your personal startup files.
[04:47:56] <somiaj> The whole point of usrmerge is to have them avialble in both places for compadaibility. So why does this matter to you?
[04:47:59] <willow> change PATH in /etc/profile?
[04:48:15] <greycat> The vast majority of Debian users do not read /etc/profile when they log in.
[04:48:32] <greycat> Desktop users, anyway.
[04:48:36] <willow> i thought it was to merge them and eliminate the /usr/... directories altogether?
[04:48:43] <somiaj> also why do you need to change this for the system
[04:48:57] <somiaj> no, there is no elimantion of the /usr directories at all
[04:48:58] <greycat> What it does is make /bin a symlink to /usr/bin.
[04:49:29] <willow> i thought /etc/profile was the top-level, system-wide profile that's sourced by all users?
[04:49:29] <somiaj> but it makes it so there is less confusion, sould a binary go in /bin or /usr/bin, now all binaries go in /usr/bin (or /usr/sbin), and links are provided for backwards compadability
[04:50:57] <willow> i thought it was the other way around: everyting goes into /bin or /sbin and /usr/bin and /usr/sbin are just symlinks (and i thought eventually would be removed)
[04:51:57] <somiaj> there is no plan to ever remove these links, and the idea is to put all things in /usr, so it is more orginzied. Maybe you should read up this more, but it also appears with your which you are trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist
[04:52:26] <somiaj> even if there were to take those links away (which they aren't planning on), which would just nicely report things inways, since they will still be in your $PATH
[04:52:43] <willow> btw i always thought /etc/profile was the master configuration where PATH gets set, and then later user's particular configs get added

[08:42:56] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.

[10:51:29] <trysten> i'm wanting to build a firewall with debian. is there someplace to look for documentation other than nftables? I was hoping for some guidance on best practice
[10:51:51] <trysten> ipv6 ideas, that kind of thing. maybe some sample configs
[10:55:09] <trysten> I guess I could have checked the nftables docs first. there probably is a good doc describing my situation
[10:57:34] <somiaj> there are various front ends that people like, I think uwf if fairly popular
[10:57:36] <somiaj> ,i ufw
[10:57:37] <judd> Package ufw (admin, optional) in bullseye/amd64: program for managing a Netfilter firewall. Version: 0.36-7.1; Size: 163.3k; Installed: 837k; Homepage: https://launchpad.net/ufw; Screenshot: https://screenshots.debian.net/package/ufw
[10:58:28] <somiaj> It also might depend on the goal of the firewall, manucally controlling it with nftables (or the iptables wrapper) gives you the most flexiability, but simple stuff the front ends like ufw can make it less doc reading

[17:50:21] <tjcarter> sussudio: EFI is a bother to those who don't understand and cannot reasonably easily control how it works, I find. Usually people prefer legacy BIOS because they know how it operates. So much of EFI seems opaque. Why are there variables I don't really have a way to view/set? Why can't I just put some code in a particular spot and have my computer boot because I did? That sort of thing.

[17:55:41] <tjcarter> shugo: the most robust way of installing a dual-boot system ideally involves two separate drives for each, and even actively removing the second drive. You install Windows, swap drives, install Linux, install both, and set Linux to boot. Then you run update-grub on the Linux system with os-prober installed so it can pick up Windows.
[17:56:02] <tjcarter> then you need to set up bootmgr to be able to chain load GRUB

[17:56:54] <tjcarter> Microsoft can do whatever it wants with your Windows drive and it will not affect Linux. I'd say the same about Linux, but Linux is better behaved in general, so that's not as much of a problem.
[17:57:56] <tjcarter> Because bootmgr operates on the Windows drive entirely (with its own EFI partition), all it really could do to you is set that drive as the boot drive in EFI. No matter, if it does so, you can use bootmgr to get back to GRUB and thereby to Linux.
[17:58:50] <tjcarter> That's the ideal … I consider everything else I would recommend based on the reality of your hardware to be a degradation of that ideal to fit necessity.

[23:21:12] <brutex> phryk : you?
[23:21:34] <phryk> btw any of you know whether browsers on debian still identify themselves as running on debian by UA string? i'm not entirely sure but I think a lot of distros changed to just using "Linux" in the UA string somewhere.
[23:21:42] <BCMM> brutex: the initrd should get recreated when you install the kernel
[23:21:45] <BCMM> by an apt hook
[23:22:11] <BCMM> phryk: as far as i recall, aptitude has never been, like, the "official" solution
[23:22:12] <phryk> brutex: sorry, last time i used a debian was probably around… 2010?
[23:22:34] <BCMM> but a lot of people have recommended it at various points
[23:22:52] <BCMM> don't think it's even installed by default (in any task)
[23:23:04] <knotMez> phryk this page just says Operating System: Linux http://sqa.fyicenter.com/1000185_Show_My_Browser_Identification_Information.html
[23:23:06] <phryk> does it still play any role? now not asking for the guide but because I'll soon get a work laptop that'll see a debian install. :P
[23:23:15] <BCMM> phryk: aptitude?
[23:23:37] <BCMM> continues to be favoured by some people, and also it does a few things that other tools don't
[23:24:10] <phryk> BCMM: like what?
[23:24:15] <BCMM> phryk: e.g. i use `apt` for searching, installing, removing and so on, but i keep apt around for some specific types of search
[23:24:17] <knotMez> can aptitude do build-dep?
[23:24:22] <brutex> BCMM: yes it's generated but on boot after grub-update i got "Inintilization failed for initram.img" - You need to load kernel first
[23:24:39] <brutex> i cannot understand
[23:24:42] <phryk> knotMez: that doesn't seem to show the actual UA string. you can get it on http://uadb.1-2-8.net/ but then it will be published on http://uadb.1-2-8.net/data.cgi
[23:24:45] <knotMez> that's something i use apt-get for still
[23:24:58] <BCMM> phryk: e.g. i don't know any equivalent of `aptitude search '~o'` using just standard tools
[23:25:14] <knotMez> aptitude search rulez!
[23:25:28] <knotMez> apt-file search is sweet too

[23:26:00] <knotMez> aptitude show
[23:26:11] <BCMM> phryk: (that shows me a list of package installed on my system that aren't available in any repos, which basically means stuff i've installed from a .deb i downloaded)
[23:26:15] <phryk> knotMez: oh wait it does show the ua string, nvm.
[23:26:20] <knotMez> I think the ncurses interface to aptitude is clunky though i never use it
[23:26:41] <trysten> i didn't mention yesterday that i was going to have nftables along with NAT, DHCP, DNS, and friends
[23:26:55] <BCMM> (e.g. zoom. allows me to keep track of the things that i have to update myself)
[23:27:27] <BCMM> phryk: i meant to say "i keep aptitude around for some specific types of search", not apt
[23:27:43] <phryk> knotMez: would you mind looking after "Browser Identification String:" and see whether debian shows up in there?
[23:27:48] <knotMez> I install everything with aptitude pretty much
[23:27:49] <phryk> BCMM: yeah, i figured. :)
[23:28:11] <knotMez> phryk i don't see Debian mentioned anywhere
[23:28:13] <BCMM> brutex: that looks like it's a problem with your kernel, not with the initramfs
[23:28:21] <phryk> knotMez: thanks for the info. :)
[23:29:19] <brutex> BCMM: im sure not loads initrd on boot
[23:29:28] <brutex> kernel is fine
[23:29:44] <knotMez> systemd just gave me another headache
[23:30:11] <knotMez> gotta lub da stuff
[23:30:43] <phryk> oh right, the work laptop will be my first contact with systemd. really interested in how that'll play out.
[23:31:06] <knotMez> phryk systemd is OK when it's not being a cut up
[23:31:14] <phryk> a cut up?
[23:31:29] <knotMez> yeah just trying to be too smart for its own good
[23:31:35] <phryk> maybe by now it's stable enough for me not to suffer under its teething pains…^^
[23:31:50] <phryk> ah, yes that's kind of what i'm afraid of.
[23:31:53] <knotMez> gtk3 programs were taking forever to start
[23:32:04] <phryk> if software tries being smart it should at least explicitly tell me about it.^^
[23:32:17] <knotMez> I don't have the world's fastest PC but 26 seconds for an application to appear is crazy
[23:32:39] <brutex> BCMM: what is the command to create initrd?
[23:32:52] <brutex> BCMM: with update-mkinitramfs?
[23:33:02] <knotMez> so I did some digging and and apparently systemd can screw with dbus
[23:33:27] <phryk> sounds like a nightmare to debug^^
[23:33:43] <knotMez> it took some google-fu to get to the bottom of it
[23:34:00] <knotMez> I ran strace and that shed no light on what was going on
[23:34:12] <knotMez> the trace would just halt
[23:34:30] <knotMez> but in syslog there was a clue
[23:34:40] <BCMM> brutex: you can read /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools to see what was *supposed* to automatically happen when you installed the kernel

[23:37:50] <brutex> ok
[23:38:16] <phryk> knotMez: that gets put into some systemd service definition file?

[23:44:30] <knotMez> I might have to downgrade

[23:47:26] <knotMez> there was something i did that got around it
[23:47:28] <phryk> select the text. font selection only applies to selected and newly written text.
[23:47:53] <knotMez> you'd thnk picking it off the list you'd be using it but no
[23:48:30] <phryk> yeh, i think it's the only way they xould enable using multiple fonts within one text.

[23:48:57] <phryk> I dunno, the last few years it's been pretty easy…
