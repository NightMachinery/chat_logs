[05:37:54] <willow> hi!  i'm trying to create a regex to match dkim TXT DNS zone records such as: http://paste.debian.net/1207332/
[05:37:55] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ debian Pastezone ]
[05:38:33] <willow> multiple strings can change in the record but what is always present is _domainkey and the ending ')'
[05:38:35] <mst> what
[05:38:57] <mst> willow: surely you'd get -just- the TXT record value first
[05:39:00] <mst> and then match that
[05:40:06] <mst> plus there's already DKIM stuff on cpan: https://metacpan.org/search?size=20&q=dkim
[05:40:08] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Search for "dkim" - metacpan.org ]
[05:40:56] <willow> i'm doing a regex substitution on the zone file and need to replace the entire dkim TXT record with a new one.  perhaps a better way to do this is if there's a perl module that is capable of parsing zone files and creating objects from the records?
[05:41:03] <mst> willow: why?
[05:41:17] <mst> willow: yeah, trying to do raw regexp on that is going to hurt
[05:41:30] <mst> https://metacpan.org/search?q=dns+zone

[05:41:37] <mst> lots of modules that handle that as well :D
[05:42:01] <willow> ok thanks 
[05:43:12] <mst> willow: it's 2am here so I'm not quite at the point of having an opinion as to which of these modules you should use
[05:44:04] <willow> hehe ok.  yes i'm parsing.  unfortunately many have dates over a decade old
[05:44:58] <mst> right, some of them are newer
[05:45:10] <mst> but also I'd point out that BIND zone file format is basically the same as it was 20 years ago
[05:45:27] <mst> so "a date over a decade old" should not be considered relevant let alone unfortunate
[05:45:30] <Grinnz> generally, it's best when your date is at least 2 decades old
[05:45:46] <mst> not everything needs to be two minutes old, this isn't javascript
[05:46:18] <mst> and the newest one is by PERLANCAR, which is usually worse than "10 years old"
[05:46:33] <Grinnz> (and more seriously, cpantesters results are usually indicative)

[05:54:17] <willow> you are right Net::DNS::ZoneFile along with the corresponding Net::DNS::RR looks great
[05:54:18] <Grinnz> i like how it escalates immediately from "no changing nicks" to "digital territory of the Joseon Empire"
[05:54:52] <xenu> i mean both are equally weird
[05:55:01] <mst> willow: I might be wrong but it definitely seems like something to try first
[05:55:07] <xenu> how does disabling /nick protect privacy
[05:55:28] <Grinnz> it protects you from reclaiming your nick after a netsplit!
[05:59:02] <mst> Grinnz: it's all SASL so your nick is fixed and nobody else can claim it
[05:59:21] <mst> like, it's still fucking stupid, but that isn't why
[05:59:23] <Grinnz> right, and then a netsplit causes there to be two yous
[05:59:38] <mst> I assume they have auto-ghost on login
[05:59:49] <Grinnz> assuming anything about their competence is dangerous

[10:47:50] <willow> there's also a "[0-9h]+" in there because records have "._domainkey.foobar 3h IN TXT"
[10:48:17] <willow> but for this example just ignore it
[10:48:31] <haarg> with perl -p, you are processing the file line by line
[10:48:41] <willow> ah
[10:48:53] <willow> that would explain it LOL
[10:49:14] <shlomif> haarg++
[10:51:25] <haarg> if you want to process the entire file at once, you can do: perl -0777 -pe'...'
[10:51:40] <haarg> however you'll need to adjust some parts of your regex
[10:51:57] <haarg> for example, you are using ^, which matches the start of the string
[10:52:16] <willow> i was just using the one-liner regex for testing.  i plan to write a script and use re compile
[10:52:35] <haarg> with normal perl -p, since it processes line by line, start of string and start of line are the same thing
[10:53:12] <haarg> but if you are matching against the full content and want to match the start of line, you need to use the /m flag
[10:57:01] <willow> awesome 👍 😃

[23:27:13] <gchristensen> I'm contemplating using `use threads` (despite the warning) to have a thread serving Prometheus::Tiny::Shared's metrics page, which would render metrics from my application. I don't use threads anywhere else. How much of a lart am I signing up for?
[23:29:42] <gchristensen> previously I've heard two suggestions: use push-based metrics, but that would be a pretty big deviation for the environment, so I'm not keen on doing that. I've also heard talk about refactoring to use async io, but (1) that'd probably be quite a lot of work, and (2) I have a bunch of code paths which will block for "a long time" and so I don't think that is super workable. Hello pickle!

[23:43:18] <Grinnz> or IO::Async::Function, or
[23:43:52] <Grinnz> you don't need to refactor the whole thing into async i/o, if you're going to block to wait for the results anyway you can still use an async event loop for that.
[23:44:03] <Grinnz> just that one part
[23:44:22] <Grinnz> threads won't help you not do that
[23:44:58] <Grinnz> if it's not a "wait for the results" scenario then a sidecar fork seems appropriate

[23:46:29] <ilmari> this is just a sidecar that runs a psgi server that seves the contents of the Hash::ShardedMem containing the prometheus stats

[23:51:59] <mst> Parallel::ForkManager is satan
[23:52:09] <mst> it actually manages to make things worse than hand-writing your process code
