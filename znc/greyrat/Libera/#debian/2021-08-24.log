[00:39:50] <urk> PMT:    The upgrade hung several times, and wouldnt upgrade the remaining 675 files required for the security lines in Bullseye.

[00:46:26] <urk> Based on the startup messages, there is a pretty good chance that reinstalling grub might fix the problem.

[00:49:19] <PMT> i'd probably try to debug why the upgrade didn't complete successfully and let it finish, then try restarting the GUI, and if it still fails to launch, debug that then
[00:49:59] <PMT> you could also try debugging why the GUI isn't launching right now, but the solution to that will probably be to finish at least part of the upgrade anyway
[00:50:38] <urk> Thats beyond my experience or skill level.  However I did a full backup with time machine, and rsync.
[00:51:30] <PMT> you can ask for help with problems as they arise, but just rolling back to the old system will likely result in a similar problem when you try upgrading again.
