[00:07:13] <[-_-]> please look here
[00:07:19] <[-_-]> they used r^-1
[00:07:33] <[-_-]> I can't interpret it, I mean can't make a meaning out of it
[00:08:05] <[-_-]> actually I agree with you on |z-z_0| > r
[00:08:38] <[-_-]> I talked about this earlier some day but then forgot, but after seeing your answer several hours ago, I found the link again
[00:10:35] <isekaijin> [-_-]: The answerer performed a change of variables.
[00:10:44] <isekaijin> [-_-]: y = 1 / |z - z_0|
[00:10:46] *** Quits: ko (~i.am@user/marlboro) (Quit: I come down here for a fat woman and that's what I'm havin.)
[00:10:47] <[-_-]> I understood that
[00:10:54] <isekaijin> Notice that y < r^{-1} is equivalent to |z - z_0| > r.
[00:10:58] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[00:11:04] <isekaijin> Then what is unclear?
[00:11:19] <isekaijin> Oh, they used it the other way around.
[00:11:31] <isekaijin> y < r is logically equivalent to |z - z_0| > 1/r
[00:11:45] <isekaijin> In any case, it doesn't really matter whether the lower bound is presented as r or as 1/r.
[00:11:49] <isekaijin> As long as you are consistent in your calculations.
[00:12:13] <[-_-]> yeah, I just wanted to show that, just to be clear
[00:12:38] <[-_-]> also wanted to make sure I did not misunderstand anything :)
[00:12:47] <isekaijin> You said “I can't interpret it”.
[00:12:54] <isekaijin> So I was like “what exactly can't you interpret?”
[00:13:45] <[itchyjunk]> basic vector is kicking my ass
[00:15:21] <[-_-]> I mean mathematicall it looks like |z-z_0| > 1/r
[00:15:41] <[-_-]> but as long as |z-z_0| is not r and more than r, things are good
[00:15:56] <[-_-]> What doesn't make sense is why I can't get that mathematically?
[00:16:10] <[-_-]> That is kind of a hack
[00:19:26] <[-_-]> I can't describe the feeling

[00:34:12] <isekaijin> [-_-]: “Why I can't get that” looks like a psychological problem, not a mathematical one.
[00:34:30] <[-_-]> :(
[00:34:33] <isekaijin> The proof presented in the linked answer is very clear.
[00:37:23] <[-_-]> http://0x0.st/orzk.jpg
[00:37:32] <[-_-]> This is a pic of the annular region
[00:38:08] <[-_-]> |z-z_0| > 1/r is this same as |z-z_0| > r ?
[00:38:49] <isekaijin> No.
[00:38:56] <[-_-]> 1/r is the distance of z from z_0, which might be within |z-z_0| < r
[00:38:58] <[-_-]> right?
[00:39:27] <isekaijin> What the linked answer says is |y| < r, not |z - z_0| < r.
[00:39:32] <isekaijin> Errr
[00:39:37] <isekaijin> What the linked answer says is |y| < r, not |z - z_0| > r.
[00:40:00] <[-_-]> it says |z-z_0| > r^-1
[00:40:01] <[-_-]> look
[00:40:13] <isekaijin> Yeah, but r^{-1} and r are not the same thing.
[00:40:15] <isekaijin> r^{-1} means 1/
[00:40:17] <isekaijin> 1/r
[00:41:11] <[-_-]> then that answer is wrong
[00:41:39] <isekaijin> The answer is not wrong, because it is presenting the annulus as r^{-1} < |z - z_0| < R.
[00:41:43] <isekaijin> Note that the lower bound is r^{-1}, not r.
[00:41:45] <isekaijin> Gawd.
[00:42:03] <isekaijin> And if you want a bound like s < |z - z_0| < R, then just use the change of variables s = 1/r.
[00:42:07] <isekaijin> It's not that complicated.
[00:42:24] <[-_-]> They are using wikipedia as ref
[00:42:50] <isekaijin> It just looks like you don't understand how to manipulate variables in a proof.

[03:10:07] <bosspotato> you can pick N numbers at random in [-1,1] x [-1,1] and count how many of them landed in the unit circle, which will be roughly equal to N times the area of the unit circle divided by 4
[03:10:50] <bosspotato> which is extremely easy to implement as a computer program but not terribly convenient when done by hand I suppose

[03:36:28] <W> yeah I don't know about the history of math at all, I'm just saying, even just casual playing around with any kind of quantification, much less "rigorous calculation", would lead to a natural observation of such a proportion, if not exactly circumference to radius, some other multiple or reciprocal. It's a very natural way to go, and infinite series and probabilistic formulations and whatnot are more complex and surely came a lot later

[07:57:24] <mycroftiv> earlier today in agda i was trying to prove that the intersection of a null type with the null type is still the null type and failing and its pretty annoying
[07:59:38] <mycroftiv> this was actually when i decided those existing sheaf definitions i have are totally unusable because https://github.com/agda/cubical/blob/master/Cubical/Foundations/Powerset.agda is not a usable definition for this in practice
[08:02:37] <mycroftiv> the dichotomy between reading 'Sheaves in Geometry and Logic' and seeing all these giant complex constructions described and proved and trying to get even the most trivial things written out in agda is stark
[08:02:58] <isekaijin> A honest, working, “blue collar” (sorry for the PCJ reference) program is one that could be translated in a mechanical and unsurprising way to a C subset without the excessively crazy features (e.g., setjmp and longjmp). In particular, you can tell the shape of a data structure *from its type*, which is impossible with first-class functions. (Because closures can capture arbitrary data without
[08:03:00] <isekaijin> telling you its type.)
[08:03:44] <mycroftiv> C programming is like set theory, functional programming is categorical
[08:05:03] <isekaijin> I don't think category theory per se forces you to use impredicative reasoning.
[08:05:27] <mycroftiv> i wasnt saying anything about impredicativity
[08:07:02] <isekaijin> Functional programming, at least in Haskell, heavily relies on impredicative features, like “newtype” wrappers around “forall a. <...>”.
[08:07:43] <isekaijin> Not to mention the kind of stuff that Clojurers do. Clojure is fortunately an untyped language, because otherwise the types would probably be even crazier than in Haskell.
[08:08:45] <isekaijin> So I think typed functional programming is, at the very least, highly correlated with the use of impredicative types.
[08:10:56] <mycroftiv> the word 'impredicative' even in the context of type theory is overloaded with several definitions
[08:12:57] <mycroftiv> and i dont think i can successfully unwind all of them relative to what i was talking about, which was mostly just about static data storage and trees
[08:16:27] <mycroftiv> set theory is like bitwise operations on tree-structured binary data

[22:39:42] <xaltsc> biberao: this is poorly written imho. If you agree that the derivative of f*g is f'*g + f*g', then by rearranging the equation and integrating the equality, you have ∫_y^x f'(t)*g(t) dt = f(x)*g(x) - f(y)*g(y) - ∫_y^x f(t)*g(t) dt
