[03:14:35] <midgardlol> was happy, got sad suddenly and now need to distract myself with some anime. Anything similar to records of lodoss war?
[03:14:38] <MootPoot> the curse type, the haunted house type, the come back from the dead type, or the spinoffs of the main ones
[03:15:17] <emmeka> ObakeNoises "Villainness, but like, only the yuri routes" is something I thought you'd appreciate
[03:15:17] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: is that a subtle way of asking who the best girl in monogatari is? because Monkey obviously
[03:15:33] <MootPoot> what
[03:15:42] <MootPoot> best girl is kisshot
[03:15:44] <MootPoot> wtf

[03:16:13] <MootPoot> uh oh
[03:16:22] <MootPoot> what's the cursed trigger/item then
[03:16:27] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: of course! I don't know why there need to be het routes to start with

[03:17:10] <MootPoot> hey
[03:17:16] <MootPoot> that's a copycat obake
[03:18:08] <ObakeNoises> I don't have time to be creative, I'm too busy wondering why people think het is necessary for sales
[03:18:40] <MootPoot> horni sells, -> sex sells, most people are het
[03:18:46] <MootPoot> $$$ 
[03:18:55] <emmeka> lesbians also sell
[03:19:01] <MootPoot> your dream will only come true in a universrse with only cute girls
[03:19:02] <ObakeNoises> I do not understand how that is an anti-yuri argument
[03:19:17] <MootPoot> so all the cute girls can cute
[03:19:19] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: yes, why must you keep reminding us we don't live in the best of all posible worlds
[03:19:28] <MootPoot> is this the darkest timeline
[03:19:40] <ObakeNoises> not quite, but it's pretty dark
[03:19:53] <ObakeNoises> there are far too few cute girls doing cute things in this universe

[03:22:26] <MootPoot> so many possibilities
[03:24:12] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: of course not
[03:24:39] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: well, actually in a way it might reverse one of my reasons I think female protagonists are more likely to be in better shows, but I still doubt I'd change that much
[03:24:50] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: that's how you'd identify my evil alternate universe version
[03:25:25] * MootPoot wonders if the world would only be cute girls then everything would just be het then
[03:25:58] <emmeka> MootPoot there is a manga to answer these questions.
[03:26:07] <MootPoot> oh no, not that one
[03:26:32] <ObakeNoises> "404: Men Not Found" is the best tag on dynasty-scans

[03:27:02] <MootPoot> different manga
[03:27:26] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: I liked that manga but the ending got kind of dumb
[03:27:41] <emmeka> yeah.
[03:28:48] <ObakeNoises> on one hand I feel like it had more potential, on the other I appreciate how crazy it got
[03:29:20] <MootPoot> There was some other manga that just gender-flipped everything, it was amusing for a while but then I just stopped caring
[03:29:26] <emmeka> I wish it'd just had more of the het girl being swayed by the gay world
[03:29:46] <emmeka> instead of the scifi struggle to get back to het-land
[03:30:02] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: yeah, that's really the manga I wanted to read, it got kind of wrapped up in it's own mythology, which wasn't as interesting as I think the author thought it was
[03:30:44] <ObakeNoises> anyway, THAT is the best timeline
[03:31:51] <ButterNoodle> ObakeNoises: meiruko-chan
[03:31:59] <MootPoot> new ep?
[03:32:03] <MootPoot> meiruko chan?
[03:32:09] * MootPoot  opens up nyaa.si
[03:32:20] <ButterNoodle> yea
[03:32:32] <ButterNoodle> a funny show about a terrifying situation
[03:33:11] <ButterNoodle> *cute girls
[03:33:56] <ObakeNoises> ButterNoodle, emmeka: Soon I'm going to figure out what few shows from 2021 I actually am going to watch before the year is over (0 shows so far!) I will need your help
[03:34:24] <emmeka> hmmm, you've missed a good year, but there's not been much of the kind of shows you preference.
[03:34:26] <ObakeNoises> it's hard because I used to watch so much, now I need to find the priority yuri
[03:34:39] <ObakeNoises> although I DO like other shows sometimes
[03:35:07] <cth> my folks
[03:35:19] <cth> someone recommended me to watch the demon king
[03:35:38] <cth> is it Demon King Daimao? or The Misfit of Demon King Academy
[03:36:02] <cth> there's a tonshit of animes with similar names
[03:36:41] <emmeka> ObakeNoises Maid Dragon sequel is a must, of course. Aquatope has been subtext yuri but nothing substantial yet. There's the Villainness sequel.
[03:36:49] <emmeka> I think that's been it for yuri
[03:36:59] <emmeka> oh. does Kanojo mo Kanojo count?
[03:37:16] <emmeka> girlfriend #1 is very yuri for girlfriend #2. also, it's hilarious.
[03:37:35] <CountDeMoney> hiarluyuris
[03:37:52] <CountDeMoney> hilaryuris
[03:38:06] <ObakeNoises> Emmanuel_Chanel: Villainess and Kobayashi-san gets a nice piece of tail were of course always on the list
[03:38:11] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: ^
[03:38:21] <ObakeNoises> 3 letters in common is just too much
[03:38:32] <emmeka> that's an anime I'm still a bit amazed got made. it's not a harem anime. it's an honest to god polycule.
[03:38:45] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: anyway, I want to talk about this now, I have to go watch a horror movie before it's too late
[03:38:55] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: I mean, sold then
[03:39:03] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: it's kind of crazy how rare that is
[03:39:28] <emmeka> ObakeNoises oh. ok. but as far as things that are vaguely yuri in 2021, that's the 4 shows I can think of.
[03:39:40] <ObakeNoises> emmeka: thank you very  much
[03:39:46] <emmeka> oh wait
[03:39:49] <emmeka> Otherside Picnic
[03:39:56] <MootPoot> meh
[03:39:57] <emmeka> which was ok, and had less yuri than expected
[03:40:03] <ObakeNoises> I actually started that
[03:40:04] <MootPoot> otherside was pretty boring
[03:40:05] <ObakeNoises> way back
[03:40:12] <MootPoot> main story wise
[03:40:13] <emmeka> apparently the LNs are way more yuri.
[03:40:19] <MootPoot> maybe manga  or LN was better
[03:40:39] <ObakeNoises> I've been pretty disgusted with LNs in general lately, but that's reading dumb shit, I should just go back to reading adachi & shimamura
[03:41:01] <emmeka> new volume out recently
[03:41:20] <MootPoot> dude who wrote otherside was a walking meme thouhg
[03:41:21] <ObakeNoises> I'm nowhere near up to that point
[03:41:26] <ObakeNoises> anyway, I shall complain about LNs later
[03:41:32] <MootPoot> I read his interview - somehow a empty grassy field is yuri
[03:41:38] <MootPoot> man's on another level
[03:50:54] <ButterNoodle> yea I dont want any grass on the field if u know what I mean
[03:54:44] <emmeka> ObakeNoises OH. One last strong rec for the season: Horimiya.

[05:57:19] <MootPoot> idk, unless you had another tool to use, breaking a modern gun with your hands is....
[05:58:44] <Snake`s_Ghost> use your imagination
[05:59:06] <Snake`s_Ghost> and besides, limiting it to specifically hands is your own idea
[05:59:24] <MootPoot> I need a hoodie
[05:59:26] <Snake`s_Ghost> you could use the environment too, like the floor
[05:59:33] <Snake`s_Ghost> or a radiator
[05:59:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or someone's face.
[05:59:46] <MootPoot> bashing a gun into the floor wont do much either
[05:59:57] <MootPoot> might break off some dinky bits but it'll work fine
[06:00:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> el cheapo plastic guns don't do too well against concrete.
[06:00:28] <Snake`s_Ghost> you could disassemble it and destroy the springs
[06:00:31] <Snake`s_Ghost> or break the pins

[09:08:53] <Nanobot> Counting calories works.
[09:09:02] <amigojapan> Counting calories is harder for me
[09:09:24] <amigojapan> And by harder I mean I can't follow it
[09:11:01] <amigojapan> Nanobot: counting calories means eating less
[09:11:11] <amigojapan> That's hard
[09:11:39] <Nanobot> Keto only works if you have a calorie deficit. Just like any diet.
[09:11:52] <Nanobot> Keto is just one way to get a calorie deficit
[09:12:05] <amigojapan> Ok

[09:13:13] <Nanobot> Please don't give diet advice to people who aren't asking for any. The hardest part of any diet is sticking with it, and recommending *other* plans is essentially telling the person to not stick with their diet.

[17:02:33] <emmeka> it was Berlin36 not tcsilver
[17:02:45] <amigojapan> Berlin36: I am using not no because of it being "NO"vember and not being able to use the Y word
[17:03:08] <Berlin36> oh lmao
[17:03:09] <amigojapan> Let me see Sadale 
[17:03:23] <Sadale> oh thanks emmeka.
[17:03:36] <zoidberg> try something different tcsilver, try legend of galactic heroes
[17:03:45] <Berlin36> you could just say "affirmative", amigojapan
[17:03:47] <tcsilver> ah, I'll try that!
[17:03:50] <Sadale> legend of galactic imouto :3
[17:03:57] <zoidberg> lol
[17:04:09] <Sadale> damn only if I could hug my imouto xD
[17:04:20] <Berlin36> imouto is little sister, right?
[17:04:22] <Sadale> If I do that I bet that she'd be like "hentai! hentai! go away! :<"
[17:04:27] <tcsilver> or "aiy, aiy kiptin"

[17:04:41] <zoidberg> tcsilver: it is rather long though
[17:04:43] <amigojapan> Berlin36: not unaffirmative
[17:04:49] <Berlin36> xd
[17:04:51] <tcsilver> how many episodes ?
[17:04:59] <hentai> Who dares disturb my slumber?
[17:05:14] <amigojapan> Sadale: that's hard to read, tomako could not read it
[17:05:23] <zoidberg> 100+ tcsilver 
[17:05:28] <zoidberg> let me check
[17:05:47] <zoidberg> 110 episodes tcsilver 
[17:07:19] <tcsilver> sounds good
[17:07:45] <tcsilver> I was watching something about the show now to get a feel for it but i would rather just buy it and watch ;D so I'll do that
[17:07:52] <Sadale> hentai, oh didn't know that you're here :3
[17:07:52] <zoidberg> tcsilver: what makes it great is it's depth. There aren't any hero or villain but it's people with different circumstances and views.
[17:07:55] * Sadale licks hentai :3
[17:08:14] <tcsilver> ah
[17:08:52] <zoidberg> you gotta watch it to experience
[17:09:15] <zoidberg> all those other scifi series are pale in comparision
[17:09:23] <zoidberg> star wars? shit
[17:09:32] <zoidberg> star trek is good though
[17:09:41] <zoidberg> expanse is good too
[17:09:41] <tcsilver> I will and soon ;D ... "we will finish this and go see her(the show) together"
[17:10:00] <DunceCotus> booby porn anyone?
[17:10:12] <tcsilver> what's the japanese word that sounds like "spiceda" mean ?
[17:10:13] <emmeka> hentai I warned you. I warned you about the pings!
[17:10:30] <zoidberg> wait, we have someone called hentai 
[17:10:37] <zoidberg> damn
[17:10:41] <Sadale> DunceCotus, you don't want porn. It's just the beginning of no fap november :p
[17:10:47] <emmeka> yes. he apparently registered the nick when libera was launched, and showed up here the other day.
[17:10:53] <amigojapan> Sadale: someone said #define no 1
[17:11:04] <Sadale> DunceCotus, if you watch booby porn right now you wouldn't be able to last for an entire month without cumming!
[17:11:20] <tcsilver> amigojapan ?
[17:11:23] <tcsilver> ^
[17:11:37] <Sadale> emmeka, lol maybe hentai just wanna get highlighted here. Based on the convo here I think he's mostly welcomed here :3
[17:11:43] <Cryowolf> I shall title my LN as "The Fractured Souls and the Fusions of Legius", not just the first volume but all of em. They'll take place in a Universe I haven't named but there will be several LNs if things work out well, that take place in this world.
[17:11:45] <amigojapan> tcsilver: that makes no affirmative in c
[17:11:46] <emmeka> do the rules of no fap november preclude sex, or is that off the table to

[17:12:02] <DunceCotus> no fap november is a scam
[17:12:06] <Cryowolf> that's a typical Light Novel name right?
[17:12:09] <zoidberg> emmeka: sex is okay unless you cum
[17:12:15] <Cryowolf> I mean it's not Isekai length, but still
[17:12:16] <Sadale> zoidberg, lol
[17:12:18] <Sadale> zoidberg, brutal xD
[17:12:24] <emmeka> zoidberg that's less than ideal
[17:12:27] <Cryowolf> but there's no Isekai in my story
[17:12:29] <Sadale> zoidberg, what's the point of having sex without cumming xD
[17:12:30] <zoidberg> but do you have the balls to have sex and not cum emmeka?
[17:12:40] <Sadale> I can understand fapping without cumming tho
[17:12:41] <amigojapan> emmeka: why are you taking that seriously and not "NO"vember?
[17:12:46] <zoidberg> even cosco doesn't have balls like that
[17:13:11] <emmeka> if it's only fapping that's off the table, then I could actually succeed at that one
[17:13:21] <Cryowolf> my medicine helps me not masturbate. If I run out though...I'll become a hypersexual beast
[17:13:30] <Cryowolf> fyi
[17:13:31] <Sadale> emmeka, having sex is out of the question to me and zoidberg. We're both virgins :3

[17:13:43] <Sadale> Cryowolf, o.o
[17:13:49] <zoidberg> yeah
[17:13:53] <emmeka> you could solve that problem for each other

[17:13:57] <Cryowolf> I take painkillers, oxycodone
[17:14:12] <zoidberg> emmeka: but we are straight
[17:14:21] <Cryowolf> opiates kill libido pretty hard
[17:14:22] <emmeka> sounds like an excuse to me
[17:14:49] <DunceCotus> operation: opiates 
[17:14:57] <Cryowolf> Sadale, nah this nick is unrelated to anything sexual
[17:14:58] <zoidberg> emmeka: straight as long piece of dried spaghetti 
[17:15:05] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, wha?
[17:15:17] <emmeka> zoidberg all you need's a little steam then, lad
[17:15:27] <zoidberg> lol emmeka 
[17:15:48] <zoidberg> but once dried, can you make it soft again?
[17:15:51] <Sadale> zoidberg, only if you pp was a long and as thin as a long piece of dried spaghetti
[17:15:59] <Sadale> s/ was a long/ was as long/
[17:16:19] <zoidberg> lol Sadale, it's a metaphor
[17:17:00] <zoidberg> if I was gay, it would be even harder considering the country I am living in, emmeka 
[17:17:10] <tcsilver> what's a good 90s or 80s toy to own that I maybe missed out on ? :D nerf guns ?
[17:17:42] <zoidberg> emmeka: gay sex is legal but gay marriage isn't and being gay isn't accepted by society, at least most of them

[17:48:19] <Cryowolf> I wear masks when I take public transit or enter a crowded place, hospital or clinic
[17:48:32] <Cryowolf> it's not because of corona fear, it's bacterial mostly
[17:48:46] <tcsilver> pretty harsh.... I spent 2019 valentines day in the hospital ;D some girl let me kiss her cheek :D
[17:48:53] <tcsilver> and she hugged me
[17:48:54] <Cryowolf> nice
[17:49:14] <tcsilver> oh
[17:49:20] <tcsilver> so do you like veggies ?
[17:49:21] <tcsilver> I do
[17:49:24] <Cryowolf> Many of them looked like they wanted to hug me but couldn't. So instead they like tapped me on the shoulder or something
[17:49:29] <tcsilver> they helped me with my condition i feel
[17:49:34] <Cryowolf> not really, not most anyway
[17:49:45] <tcsilver> oh
[17:49:46] <tcsilver> :)
[17:49:54] <tcsilver> maybe you get upset stomach ?
[17:50:19] <Cryowolf> On some veggies sure. Others it's more the taste that's awful
[17:50:26] <tcsilver> ah
[17:50:30] <tcsilver> I love veggies
[17:50:43] <tcsilver> I used to get upset stomach though
[17:50:50] <tcsilver> on some of my meds
[17:51:00] <tcsilver> like depakote
[17:51:04] <tcsilver> and cogenten
[17:51:08] <tcsilver> and artane
[17:51:13] <tcsilver> and some of the others
[17:51:35] <tcsilver> I feela lmost all better
[17:51:39] <tcsilver> but i still don't sleep well
[17:51:52] <tcsilver> so I'll giv eyou some cash so that you can feel better :D
[17:52:00] <tcsilver> maybe amigojapan can donate too ?
[17:52:05] <Cryowolf> but I do enjoy salads made from like red onions, tomatoes with the juice removed, cucumber sliced very thin, some crushed cole and then put together with flavor-free vinegar
[17:52:24] <Cryowolf> and placed in a jar for 2 weeks
[17:52:27] <tcsilver> me too cryowolf
[17:52:39] <amigojapan> tcsilver: I am broke
[17:53:05] <Cryowolf> As long as amigojapan allows me to post my link now and then, II'm good
[17:53:07] <tcsilver> ah.. me too amigojapan. I'm giving my birthday money :D
[17:53:18] <tcsilver> my parents are rich but i only get food and items generally
[17:53:22] <tcsilver> because i used to overspend
[17:53:27] <tcsilver> so now i just do window shopping
[17:53:39] <amigojapan> I see tcsilver 
[17:53:49] <Cryowolf> gonna have to ask on twitter again. Then I can fill up my emergency account again I used the last of it on several ER visits
[17:54:13] <tcsilver> ah
[17:54:25] <Cryowolf> once for an abcess that could have developed into a deep one, but it was handled with heavy injected antibiotics and deep cleaning.
[17:54:30] <tcsilver> I hope that you do well :) you deserve to do well.
[17:54:36] <Cryowolf> another for pneumonia, and then again for pneumonia
[17:54:47] <tcsilver> wow
[17:54:54] <Cryowolf> another one for a general infection
[17:54:59] <tcsilver> how much is the government willing to pay for ?
[17:55:26] <tcsilver> I think that I'll always donate now... either to you or St. Jude or SENS
[17:55:29] <tcsilver> or something
[17:56:33] <tcsilver> cancer is sickening to the minds of healthy people.... i mean : people don't deserve to get cancer. it's like amigojapan said... life is unfair
[17:56:52] <Cryowolf> for doctor, surgery etc I have to pay up to 140 euro or so anually. Medicine it's 240 euro. After that most is free with some exceptions that are subsidized. Travel to and from the hospital where my oncologist is and my treatment takes place is a bit away from where I live. So I have to pay for travel there and back. Sometimes I need to stay in the hospital, they charge per night and it's not covered by healthcare protection
[17:57:06] <tcsilver> I have a type of schizoaffective disorder and it's unfair too.... but it got better, much better.
[17:57:18] <Cryowolf> some items and medicine that might help or be needed are slightly subsidized, but still cost
[17:57:56] <tcsilver> oooh
[17:58:03] <Cryowolf> then there's things not even subsidized that could happen
[17:58:16] <tcsilver> wow
[17:58:21] <Cryowolf> but I still end up with costs that might seem trivial to some people, but are a fortune to me
[17:58:22] <tcsilver> that's aweful lewd
[17:59:10] <tcsilver> I used to be that way.. then our family business worked out and I got on benifits.. so my parents don't need extra money and most of my medical conserns are paid for
[17:59:31] <tcsilver> I have(I think): 3 kinds of benifits
[17:59:44] <Cryowolf> my family isn't rich and the only close family I have left is my mom and she's poor. I'm also poor
[18:00:09] <tcsilver> oh, what country do you live in ? or is that private data ?
[18:00:11] <Cryowolf> and I don't have the energy or ability or situation to try to find a job. I am however trying to work on a lightnovel with an illustrator
[18:00:20] <Cryowolf> but I dont know how that will trn out
[18:00:35] <tcsilver> oh I'm trying to write a video game
[18:00:41] <Cryowolf> but since I can write whenever I can, that's nice
[18:00:42] <tcsilver> (another one)
[18:00:47] <Cryowolf> I live in Sweden
[18:00:49] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[18:00:55] <tcsilver> oh wow.. a great nation!
[18:01:21] <tcsilver> pretty nifty
[18:01:26] <Cryowolf> any donation will be considered a gift and tax free. Which is why I can't give anyone anything in return no matter how small
[18:01:39] <Cryowolf> because then the IRS get greedy and predatory and tax it
[18:01:48] <tcsilver> oh
[18:02:29] <Cryowolf> I'm waiting on results from biopsy atm and I'm really scared
[18:02:52] <tcsilver> if it turns out good we will celebrate life :D
[18:03:25] <Cryowolf> If only it was that simple
[18:03:54] <tcsilver> you know this is bad news....... 2 of my best friends recently died.. one from freenode and one from gamedev.net
[18:04:06] <tcsilver> and so I've been coming to this channela nd to #ZSNES
[18:04:11] <tcsilver> and to*
[18:04:30] <tcsilver> yeah
[18:05:23] <Matt|home> morgen..
[18:05:48] <tcsilver> ya
[18:05:50] <emmeka> tcsilver my condolences.
[18:06:17] <tcsilver> :) thanks.. the truth is .. that they lived full lives... they were both ASM coders that coded with famous people.
[18:06:30] <tcsilver> and they both knew C/C++ better than me
[18:07:20] <tcsilver> once.. I introduced them to someone at Lucas Arts and it took off for them from there ;---D
[18:07:35] <tcsilver> while coding we also met someone at Blizzard
[18:07:41] <tcsilver> and someone at Marvel/DC
[18:08:12] <tcsilver> I don't code well compared to them so i never went far. though I did code for the navy
[18:08:20] <Cryowolf> tcsilver, sorry to hear that
[18:08:25] <tcsilver> and for my university
[18:08:28] <tcsilver> :D
[18:08:30] <tcsilver> it's ok
[18:08:46] <tcsilver> i miss them but this channel makes up for it almost. but they can't be replaced.. it's true
[18:08:54] <Matt|home> .. i am.. a bit hungover..
[18:08:57] <Matt|home> overdid it last night
[18:09:14] <tcsilver> ah
[18:09:15] <Cryowolf> I want to survive this so I can do this series of light novels with my illustrator partner
[18:09:29] <Cryowolf> Or maybe even a manga/LN mix
[18:09:36] <tcsilver> that would be great cyrowolf.. what did you drink matt ?
[18:09:40] <tcsilver> wow
[18:09:42] <tcsilver> a manga
[18:09:52] <Matt|home> i don't drink.. smoked about 3 bowls
[18:10:03] <tcsilver> ah
[18:10:06] <Matt|home> got 6ish hours of slee
[18:10:07] <Matt|home> p
[18:10:21] <tcsilver> oooooooooh, makes sense
[18:10:50] <tcsilver> matt where are you from ?
[18:10:55] <tcsilver> from home ? :D
[18:11:02] <tcsilver> matt is rich! :D
[18:11:07] <Matt|home> south florida. anyone gets me out of here and i'll do anything you want
[18:11:14] <tcsilver> hehehe
[18:11:30] <tcsilver> do you like code matt ?
[18:11:40] <Matt|home> yes
[18:11:45] <Matt|home> brb
[18:11:47] <Cryowolf> If we can find a way to turn his draw style into more simple and quick to draw characters and backgrounds. That would be nice for a manga. But we're thinking of making a Light Novel and Manga combo where we have more illustrations than a typical Light Novel but not as much as a Manga. The story is still being told in writing but a lot of things are shown instead of told
[18:11:59] <tcsilver> cool. if i get rich I'll keep you in mind :D I need a new team to code with.
[18:12:04] <Cryowolf> Im hoping we can do 2 light novels a year and I hope I'll be alive then :P
[18:12:32] <Cryowolf> tcsilver, keep me in mind as a creative executive chief. A Feigie :P
[18:12:35] <Cryowolf> and a writer
[18:12:38] <tcsilver> :D
[18:12:40] <tcsilver> I will!
[18:12:48] <Cryowolf> I can prove my talent with the LN I'm working on
[18:13:03] <Cryowolf> but I enjoy story heavy stuff
[18:13:11] <Cryowolf> RPGs etc
[18:13:22] <galacticbeat> we get it. light novel. not going to fill another whole day with it are you?
[18:13:37] <tcsilver> I'm working on an RPG
[18:13:39] <Matt|home> im finally.. finally getting my sink replaced today..
[18:13:40] <tcsilver> i have no story :)
[18:13:50] <Cryowolf> galacticbeat, what's your problem?
[18:13:53] <tcsilver> I have just a working game :D
[18:13:55] <hans_> bobbies
[18:14:06] <Cryowolf> tcsilver, so you got the gameplay down, but not the story?
[18:14:26] <MootPoot> cum
[18:14:26] <tcsilver> correct :)
[18:14:28] <Matt|home> tcsilver : said you were looking to join a team? can i ask what for specifically?
[18:14:31] <Matt|home> pm if you want
[18:14:49] <tcsilver> you just wake up in the middle of the woods in an inn and you adventure out and find some trasures hidden underground
[18:14:54] <tcsilver> treasures*
[18:15:13] <tcsilver> and you befriend or beat monsters
[18:15:15] <MootPoot> why are there underground treasures in a forest
[18:15:19] <MootPoot> is my question
[18:15:26] <tcsilver> hehehe no good reasons.. just to test some stuff :)
[18:15:26] <Matt|home> why wouldn't there be
[18:15:43] <MootPoot> Do forests normally have underground passages
[18:15:46] <Matt|home> it's where you'd least expect it :D
[18:15:46] <Cryowolf> well if you need a portfolio, I'll have one once I begin releasing Light Novels but not before then. I'm afraid I can't showcase my skills until then. But at that point maybe they'll become successful enough I want to pursue them as a career instead. Or, write a side project taking place in my LN world for your rpg tcsilver
[18:15:47] <Matt|home> some do
[18:16:02] <Cryowolf> just throwing out thoughts
[18:16:14] <Cryowolf> I would need to get the approval of my partner and illustrator
[18:16:29] <Cryowolf> since we're 50/50 and that's why I have an illustrator, cause I can't afford commissions
[18:16:40] <tcsilver> wow, that would be great! :D
[18:16:53] <Cryowolf> but networking is a good idea prior to and after release
[18:17:17] <tcsilver> yeah
[18:17:21] <Cryowolf> I can set up people I know as acquaintances (personal or businesss), friends or close business partners and so on
[18:17:34] <Cryowolf> and maybe end up making something cool

[18:23:08] <Cryowolf> is my motivation*
[18:23:09] <amigojapan> WB DunceCotus 
[18:23:35] <tcsilver> pizza pizza :3
[18:24:22] <amigojapan> tcsilver: Bob appetit
[18:24:26] <Jigsy> So cold...
[18:24:29] <tcsilver> my first game had a bunch of sword commands :D I don't have any sword commands in this one yet.
[18:24:34] <tcsilver> I'll add some
[18:24:39] <tcsilver> thanks amigojapan!
[18:25:07] <Jigsy> Also, finally getting around to watching Hestia is Brestia S2.
[18:25:21] <amigojapan> Jigsy: tomako did not let me turn on the AC but it's humid in this room.
[18:25:33] <Cryowolf> tcsilver, I'd love to see classic turn based jrpgs, perhaps with some fusion of strategy too
[18:25:51] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, buy a dehumudifier or use the ACs dehumidifier. It won't cool anything then
[18:25:52] <tcsilver> are you by the beach right now amigojapan ? was there a tsunami amigo ?
[18:26:13] <tcsilver> me too cyrowolf
[18:26:31] <DunceCotus> careful of coastlines
[18:26:31] <Matt|home> i didn't even get to have time to myself this morning.. repair guy came in 5 seconds after i woke up.. oh well
[18:26:34] <tcsilver> btw I used to have the name direwolf .. for about 2 weeks :D
[18:26:36] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yeah I would like one. But this is not my house today
[18:26:43] <Jigsy> Is it that hot there?
[18:27:18] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I am 3 train stations away from the coastline
[18:27:46] <amigojapan> Jigsy: it's not very very hot but it is humid like hell
[18:27:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so another 3 and you'll be 6 train stations away from the coastline, just make sure the trains will be running
[18:28:08] <tcsilver> wow guys.... I'll just go play with my game. I feel like I need to get a team together or I may never complete it.
[18:28:17] <tcsilver> there isn't much code left to do other than menus
[18:28:22] <tcsilver> and some basic combat
[18:28:26] <Cryowolf> tcsilver, instead of pure turn based, have your next turn be based on terrain and advantage. If someone wearing heavy boots walk around in a swamp, they'll obviously be slowed down while a ranger wouldn't be impacted at all
[18:28:49] <Cryowolf> and so on
[18:28:58] <tcsilver> ok :)
[18:29:09] <Cryowolf> and if an archer gets above someone, they'll get two turns for every 1 their target gets.
[18:29:17] <tcsilver> right now the scale is a lot like scret of mana
[18:29:19] <Cryowolf> that's how I think about it now
[18:29:24] <tcsilver> I want to code a world geneartor
[18:29:26] <tcsilver> another one
[18:29:30] <tcsilver> a world generator*
[18:29:34] <Cryowolf> you could use Unity
[18:29:42] <tcsilver> ya
[18:29:49] <Cryowolf> and then create the world with 3d
[18:30:02] <tcsilver> yeah I could :)
[18:30:12] <amigojapan> Unity is propriety, better use Godot
[18:30:23] <tcsilver> ah Godot
[18:30:25] <tcsilver> I like it
[18:30:27] <Cryowolf> maybe make it isometric
[18:30:31] <DunceCotus> javascript
[18:30:31] <amigojapan> Proprietary*
[18:30:37] <tcsilver> maybe so cyrowolf
[18:30:50] <tcsilver> I like all of the suggestions
[18:30:56] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, Unity is free for personal projects, then for a small project license it costs very little
[18:30:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Godot does not use JavaScript
[18:31:04] <tcsilver> I'll make some different projects :D my wealth doesn't depend on the game
[18:31:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: mores the pity
[18:31:09] <tcsilver> I can't earn with it yet
[18:31:16] <tcsilver> it's not at that stage
[18:31:23] <Cryowolf> can Godot do everything Unity can?
[18:31:24] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: unity messed up my project
[18:31:43] <Cryowolf> A lot and I mean a lot of games run on Unity
[18:31:48] <Cryowolf> successfully too
[18:31:59] <tcsilver> ah
[18:32:08] <tcsilver> I like godot because I like C++ :D
[18:32:14] <tcsilver> but unity is nice in some ways
[18:32:19] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I was using unityscript and they retired it, that would not have been such a problem of it was not proprietary
[18:32:26] <Sxem> i decided to try out that one punch man-alike, The Misfit of Demon King Academy
[18:32:45] <tcsilver> sxem oooh
[18:32:48] <tcsilver> was it good ?
[18:32:55] <Sxem> havent watched it yet
[18:32:56] <tcsilver> I want to try it
[18:32:58] <Cryowolf> well of course there's gonna be proprietary stuff on a game engine

[18:33:15] <Sxem> i just dled it
[18:33:21] <tcsilver> oh I'll look at it
[18:33:24] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I don't use proprietary software anymore
[18:33:33] <Sxem> saw a good review of it on youtube
[18:33:56] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: Godot is not proprietary and it is a game engine
[18:33:58] <Sxem> making games wd be my ideal job
[18:34:02] <Cryowolf> Personal is free and lets you play around.
[18:34:23] <Sxem> i tried crayta during my 3 months of free stadia and it sucked
[18:34:24] <tcsilver> wow
[18:34:28] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, but is it as good as unity? I have a feeling this is about creating an actual game, not a fan creation
[18:34:39] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: free of charge but not free of evil
[18:34:50] <Sxem> maybe in 5-10 years they will invent the ultimate game making game, and then i will shine
[18:34:57] <Cryowolf> free of evil?
[18:35:25] <Sxem> all the game making games ive seen so far sucked
[18:35:30] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: it may lack some stuff unity does still but it won't get better if more people don't use it

[18:35:35] <Cryowolf> I tried out RPGMaker and it was kind of annoying with the amount of stuff that needed change to get your own personal look
[18:35:55] <Sxem> i got like 300 rpgmaker games on steam for free
[18:35:58] <tcsilver> if I get some extra funds to start another company up I'll ask around in this channel :D lol....... i started a for fun company some years ago .. we worked with people from EQ/sony , EA, Blizzard, Lucas Arts and other places like westwood studios
[18:36:09] <Sxem> they must be hard to sell
[18:36:17] <tcsilver> ah
[18:36:18] <Sxem> id never use rpgmaker, i need at least 3d
[18:36:19] <tcsilver> :)
[18:36:47] <Matt|home> rpgmaker isn't bad but i prefer old school running d&d
[18:36:47] <Cryowolf> tcsilver, My primary talent is "creative", which might sound stupid but it's an actual position at many companies
[18:37:04] <Sxem> ive been playing a lot of 80s games and getting sick of 2d
[18:37:22] <zoidberg> I am back amigojapan 
[18:37:39] <tcsilver> i haven't had a company for anymost twenty years :D but it would be fun to do a demo :)
[18:37:39] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: open source software gets better the more people use it
[18:37:41] <Sxem> i own pillars of eternity on epic games, and that seems like the ultimate dnd game to me
[18:37:43] <zoidberg> try life Sxem, it is completely in 3d
[18:37:49] <amigojapan> WB zoidberg 
[18:37:51] <zoidberg> gets real
[18:37:56] <zoidberg> way too real
[18:38:03] <tcsilver> soon my family will sell more houses. and I can use some of the money on 3dRPG stuff maybe
[18:38:10] <Sxem> real life is over rated. i tried real life. it wasnt that good
[18:38:18] <zoidberg> tcsilver: I read that as horses
[18:38:34] <zoidberg> haha
[18:38:43] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, I know but it's hard to pick something that will restrict you and limit your creative process
[18:38:49] <tcsilver> hehe
[18:39:01] <Cryowolf> Sxem, I have it on steam
[18:39:07] <tcsilver> well...I live on converted horse farm property :D
[18:39:10] <zoidberg> what's up amigojapan? are you having late night snack today?
[18:39:24] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I was majorly restricted my unity when they retired that language
[18:39:39] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I already had it

[19:16:53] <Cryowolf> yeah but as long as they are 18+

[19:19:30] <Cryowolf> Sadale, my first reaction to that would have been if it's powered and responds to pressure. So it moves around and waves and changes position

[20:07:19] <Bco1981> 6-13% better
[20:07:22] <MootPoot> afaik its something to do with the chiplet/modular cpu cores/tiles that AMD has - some pairs of cores work better together then other pairs ( even though they're all the same speed )

[20:29:34] <cth> I think I know why so many of anime are not finished
[20:29:41] <cth> they just run out of creativity. 
[20:30:28] <emmeka> cth your guess is wrong
[20:30:55] <cth> maybe
[20:30:57] <emmeka> cth most anime are unfinished because most anime are made as promotional content for their source material. it's just a different business model than the west.
[20:30:58] <Bco1981> many mange/LN have far more, and many are complet
[20:31:06] <cth> ooooooooooooooooooooooh
[20:31:09] <cth> really?
[20:31:12] <Bco1981> manga*
[20:31:13] <Bco1981> yes
[20:31:14] <cth> to promote mangas?
[20:31:19] <cth> holy shit
[20:31:20] <Bco1981> and LN's
[20:31:25] <emmeka> cth imagine if Marvel made movies just to sell more comic books. that's basically how the anime industry works.
[20:31:26] <cth> insane
[20:31:29] <MootPoot> afaik usually the giveaway is if its a 12 episode season or 25
[20:31:36] <emmeka> it's just a different economy there.
[20:31:37] <MootPoot> from what I can figure out
[20:31:42] <cth> but isn't anime much more profitable than manga?
[20:31:47] <MootPoot> if its 12, very high chances of being a promo manga
[20:31:52] <MootPoot> promo anime
[20:31:55] <cth> I mean, look at the movies world wide. They bring a lot more than books.
[20:32:20] <cth> if its 12 episodes?
[20:32:24] <cth> wow
[20:32:25] <MootPoot> idk about anime specifically, but cth comparing movies vs anime is a bit broken
[20:32:32] <MootPoot> compare tv shows vs anime - 
[20:32:41] <cth> well even tv shows are very profitable
[20:32:44] <MootPoot> even tv shows in the west most often dont make a lot ( relatively )
[20:32:48] <emmeka> cth anime is expensive to produce. a single episode is like $250k USD.
[20:32:56] <cth> WOW
[20:32:58] <cth> really?
[20:32:59] <cth> why?
[20:33:10] <emmeka> why? because it's animated. it's labour intensive.
[20:33:11] <cth> is it like that for any cartoon?
[20:33:15] <emmeka> yes.
[20:33:17] <MootPoot> they need ads to get by - and for anime its like most of the money is from merchendising - maybe emmeka  can confirm on that
[20:33:22] <emmeka> I mean, yes and no

[20:33:27] <MootPoot> selling overpriced figures and shit
[20:33:40] <cth> well I wouldn't mind animations
[20:33:43] <emmeka> MootPoot anime mostly pays for itself by selling overpriced Bluray volumes.
[20:33:49] <emmeka> and merch, and source material.
[20:33:54] <cth> interesting
[20:34:12] <cth> well... but if anime is just a promotion tool for mangas...
[20:34:14] <emmeka> anime producers actually *pay* for timeslots on networks to air their shows
[20:34:21] <cth> why don't we have the manga chan, but do have the anime chan
[20:34:22] <emmeka> and then get the commercial time to sell merch and shit
[20:35:10] <MootPoot>  cth cuz anime is just fast manga
[20:35:12] <MootPoot> lol
[20:35:14] <emmeka> cth I won't say *only* a promotional tool, because 1) anime-original content does exist, where the anime is the source material 2) lots of series do get long runs and full adaptations because they were so popular that doing so is profitable
[20:35:21] *** Joins: Snake (~Snake@user/snake)
[20:36:01] <emmeka> but this is the answer to your question, why do so many anime go unfinished. because they were never supposed to be complete on their own. they're basically trying to rope you into buying the manga or the LN with a big, huge, fancy promo
[20:36:04] <cth> I see
[20:36:11] <cth> thank you
[20:36:33] <cth> And I'm disappointed now
[20:36:37] <MootPoot> *sad gangsta noises*
[20:36:46] <MootPoot> production company literally went bankrupt halfway through
[20:36:51] <cth> wow
[20:36:57] <emmeka> if it's any consolation, we seem to be in the golden age of sequels
[20:37:01] <MootPoot> I really wanted that one to finish
[20:37:30] <cth> sequels? Can we expect Vampire D sequel?
[20:37:36] <emmeka> like 5-10 years ago, nothing got sequels, it seemed like everything got its 12 episodes and then no matter how popular was hung out to dry
[20:37:37] <MootPoot> Vampire Dick
[20:37:40] <cth> Or Berserk
[20:37:48] <Snake> I was gonna rewatch dragon maid but i better just go to season 2 straight away
[20:37:51] <MootPoot> Berserk ain't getting anything tho
[20:37:52] <emmeka> but now it seems like *most* shows airing in a season are sequels and lots of series are getting necro'd
[20:38:02] <MootPoot> creator/writer ded
[20:38:10] <cth> and?
[20:38:13] <emmeka> I mean, if Log Horizon and The Devil is a Part Timer can get sequels, anything can
[20:38:17] <cth> can't they still continue his work?
[20:38:38] <cth> damn, the devil is a part timer sounds very fun
[20:38:40] <Snake> That way if i wanna rewatch with a friend or smth then it wont be my 3rd time watching
[20:38:40] <cth> is it fun?
[20:38:41] <MootPoot> he/his family owns the IP rights - I dont think so... although I'm not 100%
[20:38:58] <S_T_A_N> I feel dead inside
[20:39:28] <cth> well, I have too much work now to watch anything. Maybe later next year tho

[21:11:22] <Bco1981> living room pc is 3900x, tests show that a 5800x can get more fps out of the 3080.
[21:11:30] <MootPoot> tbh, the cheap bastard route isen't that bad - 
[21:11:48] <MootPoot> 400 bucks on a carefully picked refurb can get you a lot of computer

[21:12:19] <MootPoot> Bco1981: one girl in my uni managed to make it through the entire program on a 100 dollar netbook running a celeron
[21:12:31] <Bco1981> wow
[21:12:47] <MootPoot> I was actually impressed - although she got it because she didnt have any other money left , so I'll hold back any bitching about shit choices
[21:13:09] <MootPoot> Bco1981: we had to run the full ( not code ) visual studio as well for most classes
[21:13:31] <Bco1981> that must have been hard for that thing
[21:15:19] <MootPoot> I'll only make fun of people who thinks computer are cheaper then they actually are
[21:16:56] <MootPoot> Bco1981: once my family gifted a xbox 360 to our cousins family - xbox being xbox , the power brick exploded
[21:17:11] <MootPoot> they took it to the repairshop and thought they were being ripped off when the dude quoted him the price
[21:17:27] <MootPoot> then the repairshop guy was like "it seems like somebody gifted you this"
[21:18:51] <MootPoot> there was many lols after that

[21:41:18] <galacticbeat> alder lake launches on the 4th.
[21:41:43] <tcsilver> I saw that dell is selling pcs with ddr5
[21:42:46] <galacticbeat> decided to swap the d15S for a regular D15 and get the extra fan
[21:43:06] <Bco1981> smart... you're gonna need it
[21:44:35] <Bco1981> oh so they really did start shipping
[21:44:47] <MootPoot> I need to go back and check where I read that
[21:44:59] <Bco1981> 4days ago
[21:45:00] <Bco1981> Got my 12900k already and DGAF about their embargo, not my problem. What is my problem however is I can't use my water cooling solution with a fucking bracket I need to wait on....
[21:45:01] <MootPoot> It might have been "you'll be able to buy one in Q1" or something like that
[21:45:14] <Bco1981> Which means now I need to run this chip gimped using an air cooler, and it runs hotter than my 11th gen, way way hotter than I'm comfortable with and thermal throttling is now an issue again.
[21:45:17] <MootPoot> or maybe it was about the intel gpus
[21:45:31] <MootPoot> why really even bother with alder lake really
[21:45:38] <MootPoot> its interesting to poke at, but to use?
[21:45:43] <Bco1981> Oh yes and did I mention this doesn't run ANY of my older games without crashing? Can't even open most of them without getting kicked back to desktop, and there's little to no hope devs are going to patch any 5+ years old games. Fuck. But the good news is I can run any synthetic benchmark tool without fail.
