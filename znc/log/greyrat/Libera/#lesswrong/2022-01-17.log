[03:21:04] <gwern> when it comes to porn, it's a dead end. the backlash worldwide is far greater than whatever profits you can eek out on the dark side
[03:21:23] <gwern> you'll notice that despite a century and geographical coexistence, hollywood remains porn-free
[03:21:42] <gwern> how many dollars a year does MGM take in from porn? I'm going to guess that it's ~$0

[03:22:52] <catern> I mean, I could easily imagine a playboy style strategy
[03:23:23] <catern> masking porn with elevated content - well, not that that was successful for playboy (or was it?)
[03:23:55] <catern> no-one would pay for porn - but pay for movies and just incidentally get the porn? maybe!
[03:24:21] <adiabatic> I strongly figure that in the States, people don't want surprise porn
[03:24:31] <catern> but yes, the backlash may make that infeasible
[03:24:32] <adiabatic> like, say, the boob flash on the halftime show for football
[03:24:39] <gwern> playboy has struggled to break out of its niche, and is mostly a licensing play right now, as I understand
[03:25:11] <gwern> it can be a good niche, and I'm sure hugh hefner's lifetime earnings were pretty nice. but 'being the most profitable porn company in the world' is sort of like 'being the fastest second grader in the world'

[22:49:59] <pompolic> the first thing i thought of was the thread earlier here about "beautiful data"

[22:50:45] <pompolic> sold
[22:51:15] <rsaarelm> Thinking of the olden times RPG publishing and the sorts of people who try to write their own RPG rulebooks, a good starting point for a lot of them would probably be just informing them that typographical design is a thing to begin with.
[22:51:35] <gwern> I think it does go a little heavy on the accessibility-yay but since accessibility usually goes without a single thought I'm willing to tolerate a pro position in the other direction as a corrective
[22:51:43] <rsaarelm> And things like making the rulebook ergonomic for people who are trying to learn the system.
[22:51:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> rsaarelm: Ehhh. That doesn't go as far as you might think. Look at the OSR stuff...
[22:52:30] <rsaarelm> I know Mörk Borg is a very special snowflake book, aren't aware of other stuff that'd be particuarly egregious.
[22:53:03] <rsaarelm> I figured people will get reasonably prompt feedback these days if their book layout is a complete mess.
[22:53:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> OSRIC, ACKS, all that kind of thing, are perfect examples of people knowing that typography is a thing, knowing that visual design is a thing, but not being able to hire anyone to do those things, doing it themselves, and the result is ... well, I *guess* it's better than Gygax's "I KNOW THREE TYPOGRAPHICAL ELEMENTS AND THEY ARE BOLD, ALL CAPS, AND BOLD ALL CAPS", but... not much?
[22:54:44] <rsaarelm> Are there tabletop gamebooks that you think have particuarly good typesetting and design?
[22:55:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mentioned Paizo's stuff the other day, but also the Eclipse Phase rulebooks are very well done
[22:55:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (... and are also another example of "style overshadows substances", incidentally)
[22:56:05] <rsaarelm> Right.
[22:56:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> In that case it's actually a double whammy: the "style" is both the visual design of the rulebooks *and* the incredibly well-done aesthetic "flavor" of the setting
[22:56:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... which totally masks the fact that there's barely a game there at all
[22:56:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's lots of game mechanics but almost no game structures
[22:57:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, here's a specific example of "OSR writers do things themselves, but it turns out they are not visual designers"

[22:57:51] <Robomot> The Alexandrian » Encumbrance by Stone – Legends & Labyrinths Sheet (Go to Part 1This is an equipment sheet designed to be used with the Encumbrance by Stone rules for Legends & Labyrinths / 3rd Edition I posted yesterday. (It's similar to the sheet for OD&)
[22:58:23] <pompolic> i suppose this is the equivalent of programmer art
[22:58:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I basically have nothing but good things to say about Justin Alexander as an RPG designer, commentator, etc.
[22:58:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> So he made that encumbrance sheet, PDF linked on the page
[22:59:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It took me like an hour to do this version: https://wiki.obormot.net/attach/L_and_L_style_encumbrance_sheet.pdf?v=1513055531.pdf

[22:59:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> See the difference?
[23:00:50] <gwern> heh. I was thinking to myself, 'this has decent bones but the lines are all way too thick, making it hard to read and wasting a lot of space'
[23:00:52] <rsaarelm> Right,
[23:01:37] <rsaarelm> Just seeing those two side-by-side is a really good instruction for drawing attention to stuff you don't see if you're naive.
[23:01:39] <gwern> I'm also not sure why Gems is so big. do you really need to track *that* many gems?
[23:02:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: In old school type games where you're doing a lot of dungeon crawling and treasure extraction, yes
[23:02:13] <rsaarelm> Maybe wizards need specific types of gems as spell components?
[23:02:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the context, so the big "gems" section is totally appropriate
[23:02:40] <gwern> are gems so heterogeneous that you can't do better than just a big empty space for handwritten lists?
[23:02:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yeah
[23:02:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> 100%
[23:03:23] <gwern> what a pity. meanwhile, Notes goes begging
[23:03:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, it's an encumbrance sheet, not a complete char sheet. Anyway - is it perfect? Probably not. But my point is made, I think
[23:05:41] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/epi_michael/status/1483143937359495172 looks like a big chunk of long covid is psychosomatic, but it's definitely a thing. also two shots is probably enough to bring the risk of long covid down to zero

[23:20:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Looks cool though
[23:20:58] <ggreer> it's going to take almost 12 hours to print the next prototype. it reminds me of when I was a kid and I had to compile perl on my 486

[23:29:34] <kuudes> https://twitter.com/bob_wachter/status/1482424398342619137?s=21 is particularly reasonable sounding
[23:29:36] <Robomot> Bob Wachter (@Bob_Wachter): "Some folks are a bit confused about why things are likely to be much safer in a month than now – not why virus will peak & fall (we don’t entirely know) but why the risk to individuals will plummet – & with that, why activities that are unsafe now will be much safer then.(1/20🧵)"
[23:30:13] <kuudes> and clearly after the wave drops, indeed the situation is much safer for an individual, until the next wave in 8/2022
[23:30:54] <kuudes> personal risk = local prevalence * risk on infection, and local prevalence drops much if/when herd immunity gets reached at least temporarily
[23:31:29] <kuudes> risk on infection is mainly affected by vaccinations and available drugs; also of course in case of surge wave the hospitals being full
[23:32:14] <kuudes> paxlovid still seems quite expensive; a treatment series is 500 e. pfizer vaccine dose is 20 e, so 1 paxlovid series = 25 vaccine doses

[23:35:57] <gwern> that'd be amusing except Spiritualists already did that and none of them worked
[23:38:07] <kuudes> when do you guys presume comirnaty will be released for normal medicine, ie similar as for influenza vaccines, that a doctor can prescribe to you and you can then buy it from a pharmacy?
