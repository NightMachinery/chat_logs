[00:01:21] <sillymob[m]> ha, i think "what's some magic present in the PHP interpreter?" was the real question
[00:01:27] <apotheon> 20:24 < nomagno> Python types are really just structs wrapped around C types, with very sane architecture
[00:01:38] <sillymob[m]> the thing i would say PHP aced is the deployment/execution model. very easy for beginners.
[00:01:40] <tane> hrhr, well, for all the crappy slow software that bugs me daily, I find reiterating the "performance isn't so important" argument more than disturbung, because often times, it does matter and should be a non-functional requirement from the get go for most things apart from some throwaway run-once python scripts

[00:04:41] <sillymob[m]> tane: i'd say in an environment where your time is spent waiting on DB/network, the speed of your scripting language is not overly important.
[00:04:50] <apotheon> mod_perl was kind of a weird idea, anyway, largely prompted by the fact people started getting unreasonably negative about CGI
[00:05:08] <sillymob[m]> CGI is just 1990s serverless üòÅ

[00:07:37] <kveroneau> You do have a fair point there.
[00:08:11] <kveroneau> The popularity of some languages is usually based on some killer package or feature.  For Ruby, it was Rails, for Python it's now AI.
[00:08:38] <sillymob[m]> and most of the python ML stuff is written in C anyway...
[00:08:49] <pyzozord> ^
[00:09:02] <pyzozord> Pythons killer feature is it's simplicity
[00:09:29] <tane> the simplicity to call highly performance optimized fortran and C libraries.. yeah
[00:09:53] <pyzozord> Yeah.. ?
[00:10:10] <kveroneau> Fortran?
[00:10:16] <apotheon> PHP only needed to exist long enough to inspire other languages to include well-designed ways to write HTML templates.
[00:10:32] <pyzozord> Don't see what's wrong with that, actually I think that's the right way
[00:10:42] <tane> it is
[00:11:03] <kveroneau> So Fortran over C is the right way? haha
[00:11:22] <tane> scientists accessing optimized libraries through python is the right way

[00:28:01] <oldlaptop> I don't care whether they got to real money by wasting a billion here and a billion there, or by dumping the whole five trillion at once.
[00:28:53] <oldlaptop> The end result is that the cheap chromebook behind a lousy connection is downloading megs and megs of software and spending zillions of its limited CPU cycles for no good reason
[00:28:54] <apotheon> I hink d3x0r's point is that often the problem is duplication rather than excess quantities of non-duplication.
[00:28:59] <apotheon> in some sense
[00:29:06] <mspe> apotheon: many times I got surprised by python having the most concise way ending up being the fastest
[00:29:11] <nomagno> I'm scared to even think about the final performance ratio of my fake architecture VM to the actual bare metal
[00:29:13] <apotheon> . . . and deduplication is often an absurdly easy fix.
[00:29:32] <oldlaptop> apotheon: If you mean that sucking down jquery is even less forgivable when you do it five times, I agree so far as that goes.
[00:29:34] <pyzozord> Businesses have often no incentive to make product of high quality. People will swallow everything because there is just so much demand and so much software is still not written. This will eventually end. Eventually we will start having having software do most of what we want
[00:29:45] <oldlaptop> It doesn't make the approach acceptable in the first place.

[00:53:42] <mspe> ‚Üë agreed, unless they contribute to it
[00:53:44] <mrig> and also the bubble factor of chasing the latest cargo cult, is never going to be stable nor accepted by anyone with wisdom.
[00:53:46] <nomagno> These people deserve to be paid. But the revenue model of selling binaries and prohibiting redistribution, plus blocking access to the source, is very shaky
[00:54:06] <mrig> they will generally be revolted by it.
[00:54:08] <sonny> heh, classic arbitrary price for big corp

[00:56:35] <MinimotoMusashi> I love open source, and freedom of information. But I also like getting paid to do what I like to do!
[00:56:43] <nomagno> pyzozord: same thing, arbitrarily blocking access to data. Again, not saying the book authors don't deserve to be paid, but the revenue model of arbitrarily blocking redistribution goes against the ideas modern society is based on
[00:56:45] <sonny> but say, I got some comics for darkhorse, I can only read them on their website ...
[00:56:55] <pyzozord> I think I could see a world where it is all free of charge for personons, but companies are charged heavily and often

[00:57:30] <tomathy> i have no idea how to make money writing software
[00:57:40] <pyzozord> Some industries like entertainment would probably get smaller, but the true passionstes would stay in it. You write books because you have to not because you want money or fame
[00:57:50] <flakland> easy, find someone to pay you
[00:57:51] <pyzozord> So that could actually be for the benefit

[00:58:05] <apotheon> I'd be okay with corporations, specifically (but not "business" in general), being subject to copyright restrictions, because corporations are not entities with ethical agency and do not have rights in a general sense.

[01:47:48] <sonny> goodbye dynamic resources
[01:48:15] <pyzozord> Borrow checking and all the other rust stuff is so complex. My stack idea is extremely simple

[01:49:54] <pyzozord> sillymob[m] same thing when you run out of memory. Stack is just memory. You can make stack to be all of available memory
[01:49:55] <sonny> yeah
[01:50:08] <sonny> not sure what they do for the ownership thing though
[01:50:19] <beaky> closures are another example where you cant just allocate everything in some parent since the free variables captured in the closure can have indefinite lifetime (thus why rust has lifetime parameters)
[01:50:45] <flakland> i'm terriified at the thought of a kernel paging stack from disk
[01:50:59] <d3x0r> there are c programs you can write - and statically allocate everything on the stack I'm sure - so by thte time you return to main you've never malloced and all stuff is clean

[01:52:43] <sillymob[m]> pyzozord: what about ref counting?

[01:53:13] <d3x0r> pass a space for that return
[01:53:34] <beaky> this is why rust lifetimes exist so that rust can formally say 'some things live longer than the scope they are in'
[01:53:44] <pyzozord> Functions cannot return at all
[01:53:49] <beaky> and enforce minimal lifetimes for borrowing
[01:54:07] <pyzozord> They can only mutate memory they were given
[01:54:08] <beaky> without return then your entire program becomes like continuation passing style i think
[01:54:09] <d3x0r> then how do you implement `sin(x)` ?

[02:17:48] <InPhase> pyzozord: Actually what might be interesting is a prime-step stack.  Choose a large prime somewhere near but not too near 2^63, then every time you add an element you append, and every time you pop an element you take the last index you popped from and add the prime then modulo the size to determine which want to pop and swap and replace with the last element.

[03:02:15] <phogg> unetudiantJS: it's not a function. Or rather, it's calling the constructor function of a class. Unless this is JS, in which case it's syntactic sugar to make things look like they do in Java without being anything like Java in reality.

[03:04:43] <unetudiantJS> oi ok

[03:06:11] <phogg> a method is just a function!
[03:06:26] <sonny> yeah
[03:06:30] <flakland> maybe they felt obligated because they both java-named languages
[03:07:16] <phogg> the weird thing is how much trouble JS goes through pretending to have classical OO even though it has something better
[03:07:46] <phogg> flakland: you have the order backwards. Java was the new hot thing *and so* JS was renamed to position it as a companion language
[03:08:03] <vdamewood> unetudiantJS: In JavaScript, the new keyword calls a function as a constructor. That means that a new object is made, then passed to the function as it's 'this' object. This object is then returned by the new operator.
[03:08:15] <d3x0r> classically OO as in self?
[03:08:36] <sonny> probably not
[03:08:56] <sonny> self would've worked for the web as well

If they can't then make them explain why they will inhibit the codebase in the future, then they need to explain the business case for the time it takes to re-create something that already works.

[09:14:33] <oldlaptop> (so as to support shitty software from ports, openbsd nowadays allows processes to map W&X pages if their binaries have a special flag in them; executing such binaries only works from filesystems mounted with a special mount option, usually limited to /usr/local - which is where shitty software from ports goes)

[12:15:56] <pyzozord> I'm just thinking about my own language that would be stack based. I realized that functions in my language couldn't really return structs with pointers because whatever the pointers pointed to would be freed at the time of return (because it all lives on stack)
[12:16:05] <alycidyne> mrig: only if compilation implies type checking

[12:17:07] <pyzozord> so seems like the only way to pass complex linked structs would be to pass some memory to a function and let it write to that memory, but then the function isn't really a function because it's main job is to write to memory it received not to return
[12:17:52] <pyzozord> actually I could even think of the return as writing to allocated memory to, so return being a syntactic sugar on top of that same non-return model

[12:19:10] <pyzozord> alycidyne: yeah return would be more of "please don't pop this part of the stack"
[12:19:17] <d3x0r> which in C++ you'd pass a reference & and return void
[12:19:48] <pyzozord> d3x0r: yes, that's my inspiration
[12:19:54] <d3x0r> could do...  push return space; push args, call, push local, pop pop pop 
[12:19:58] <d3x0r> leave return space
[12:20:01] <alycidyne> pyzozord: actually it's not even a matter of please because what the function does becomes its interface

[12:33:28] <alycidyne> mrig: well it's a consequence of 'there should be only one way to do it'

[15:36:25] <mobidrop> [itchyjunk], I suppose those are roundabout ways as well, like video games but they still require external input
[15:37:18] <[itchyjunk]> well a brain can only sense via sense organs
[15:37:33] <[itchyjunk]> so it would make sense that it tries to optimize to maximize engagement of self organs
[15:38:14] <RenAdjest> I thought brain prioritize for self preservation?
[15:38:19] <mobidrop> yes but it can hack the reward circuitry with advanced technology like computers to view the things that are rewarding

[17:09:04] <merijn> mrig: Not really
[17:09:10] <mrig> How so?
[17:09:31] <merijn> mrig: Incompleteness is more about the conflict between expressivity and analyzability
[17:09:54] <merijn> A 100% analyzable formals systems cannot encode all true things

[17:10:34] <DnzAtWrk> yeah there was a long chapter on epistemology, with the god Hermes explaining for Socrates the limits of human knowledge
[17:10:39] <merijn> You *can* make formals systems that are 100% verifiable/analyzable, by giving up some expressivity
[17:10:39] <mrig> sure that makes sense, seems pretty logical.
[17:11:02] <DPA> Any statement is always only true within certain logic systems. It's always possible to create new self consistent logic systems in which a similar statement is false.
[17:11:22] <mrig> You are, I think, speaking in more generic terms where as I was applying it to physics.
[17:11:23] <DnzAtWrk> But the thing is... I don't see how that could possibly work in ANY way you look at it
[17:11:26] <mrig> philosophy.
[17:11:40] <DnzAtWrk> any system in which true is false would be inherently broken and can not exist
[17:11:42] <mrig> DPA quite.
[17:12:24] <tangy> and yet, there are people who live that every day. :-/
[17:12:48] <merijn> tangy: This is why we invented paraconsistent logics to deal with the real world :p
[17:12:58] <DPA> No. True and false are symbols. I can define a logic system where everything is that value. It won't be very useful, but it can be created & used.
[17:13:08] <mrig> merijn sounds like a teapot to me :)
[17:13:11] * tangy is googling ...what he said
[17:13:53] <merijn> tangy: paraconsistent logics are formal logics where contradictions (i.e. proposition P is both true *and* false) is not a breakdown of the logic
[17:14:08] <mrig> para is a wonderful sanskrit term, perfectly precise in this utilisation.
[17:14:21] <merijn> tangy: So logics that explicitly handle contradictions as special (but valid) case next to true and false
[17:14:22] <mrig> parakaram says pretty much the same thing.
[17:14:31] <DnzAtWrk> yes, but that only works in isolated systems within a truly consistent system

[17:15:03] <mrig> krama as relates to the aforementioned krami 
[17:15:16] <DnzAtWrk> this reminds me of the thought experiment of a reverse-entropy universe
[17:15:16] <mrig> in fact parakrami would fit here I think.
[17:15:24] <DnzAtWrk> could life evolve if entropy always decreased
[17:15:34] <DnzAtWrk> it's a bit silly
[17:15:50] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: An interesting epistemological question is: Can you convince people of things like De Morgan's law in logic or induction if they do not, a priori, believe them
[17:16:11] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: I think the answer is no. Deep down every human already believes in some form of induction

[17:17:43] <mobidrop> there are also evolutionary reasons to believe in irrational things
[17:18:02] <DPA> DnzAtWrk: It's generally assumed that the increas of entrophy leads to what we perceive as the flow of time. So a universe where it decreases, if something lives there, it would experience it again such that it seams to increas for it.
[17:18:06] <mobidrop> for example if you adamantly don't believe in God you were going to have a bad time in medieval times during the Inquisition
[17:18:17] <DnzAtWrk> that's just one theory DPA

[17:18:47] <merijn> mobidrop: It depends how much you offended people in charge
[17:18:51] <DnzAtWrk> I guess it makes perfect sense that entropy itself causes time

[17:46:53] <pyzozord> it actually makes me question, maybe I shouldn't be a programmer, I don't think I have what it takes to be a real engineer
[17:47:09] <MiraCat> Who says you can't make programming a hobby pyzozord 
[17:47:14] <Jck_true> Premature optimization. You can *A* Use an array. *B* spend a week designing a system of hash buckets and linked lists and get the distributions just right. Only to discover that it's slower...
[17:47:25] <nomagno> MiraCat: It's possible, but definitely unconventional
[17:47:45] <pyzozord> I like tinkering, tinkering is bad
[17:48:02] <MiraCat> It's not that unconventional. Python, lua, and even javascript are common for game scripting languages because it's faster than recompiling C/C++ code for a minor change. I don't see lisp as any different.
[17:48:08] <nomagno> You want to make the ABI between C and Lisp as small as possible (AKA using structs is not a hood idea)

[17:50:14] <mobidrop> godot has a scripting language right
[17:50:16] <DnzAtWrk> godot has GDScript so it's basically a language
[17:50:30] <mobidrop> why everything has to make their own scripting language tho
[17:50:32] <MiraCat> Godot is the engine

[18:15:23] <DnzAtWrk> I can say that to me, javascript seems to be super easy because it gives direct feedback to what you're doing, and has tons of boilerplate already built-in

[19:50:41] <oldlaptop> MiraCat: "Is C++ Good(TM), or is C++ Bad(TM)" is inherently a question that attracts strong opinion
[19:50:53] <oldlaptop> rather like "Is the True Editor emacs or vi?"

[19:52:31] <MiraCat> About that lisp terminal mrig, I might just do that or write a lisp interpreter in C++ instead of C. I just hate manual memory management, so that rules out C.
[19:52:44] <nomagno> vi is atandardized, emacs isn't
[19:52:52] <MiraCat> Emacs is an operating system, sir.
[19:52:57] <[itchyjunk]> we need vimacs
[19:52:57] <nomagno> So I can run vi on the heptanoggles 600
[19:53:07] <oldlaptop> nomagno: emacs is refractory to standardization
[19:53:11] <MiraCat> That would be vile [itchyjunk]
[19:53:16] <[itchyjunk]> :D
[19:53:19] <MiraCat> VI Like Emacs.
[19:53:25] <[itchyjunk]> you say that like its a bad thing
[19:53:28] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I like the idea of Lisp but find S-Expressions kind of unreadable.
[19:53:28] <nomagno> But emaca might only run on the "age of the universe loadtime boggles 890"
[19:53:33] <pyzozord> and tabs are superior
[19:53:37] <pyzozord> got I need to go out more
[19:53:38] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I have similar opinions of Forth.
[19:53:42] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Tcl I can get behind.
[19:53:42] <pyzozord> s/got/god/
[19:53:50] <nomagno> sorry, cheap shot :P
[19:53:51] <MiraCat> You just got to write and read more lisp. I thought it was gibberish at first too Thedarkb-Desktop 
[19:54:13] <oldlaptop> The trick of using curly braces for quoting really was diabolically clever in that regard.
[19:54:27] <oldlaptop> (Stealing C's expression syntax for expr/if/for/etc. helps of course.)
[19:54:32] <nomagno> Yes, just be happy
[19:55:03] <pyzozord> i feel random opportunities for learning for me from irc have dropped in recent months, probably I should focus more on book study
[19:55:14] <MiraCat> Exactly how smart are smart pointers in C++?
[19:55:16] <pyzozord> don't want to though, what awaits me is math and I hate it :(
[19:55:50] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Emacs is a magnificent operating system lacking only a good text editor.
[19:56:06] <MiraCat> Just turn on vi emulation then bro for emacs.
[19:56:08] <nomagno> oldlaptop: What does that mean?
[19:56:12] <mrig> MiraCat oh I quiet enjoy it :)
[19:56:44] <[itchyjunk]> what about writing everything in verilog?
[19:57:05] <mrig> really is fascinating the technique used in these game programming lectures.
[19:57:14] <mrig> It is so simple that it is just a non issue.
[19:57:25] <mrig> quite funny really.
[19:58:07] <mrig> and dynamic loading of dlls so you have direct update without needing to reload the program.
[19:58:32] <mrig> but for a terminal that would be a whole other thing :)
[19:58:38] <oldlaptop> nomagno: Tcl has syntax vaguely similar to Bourne-ish shells, but cleverly disguises itself as a curly-brace language by using {} for quoting. (Almost precisely equivalent to '' in Bourne-family shells)
[19:58:52] <Thedarkb-Desktop> [] vs `` as well.
[19:59:14] <MiraCat> I guess I'll be using a combination of C++ and lisp for my games then. Awesome :D
[19:59:24] <Thedarkb-Desktop> It makes things more readable because opening and closing quotes are clear.
[19:59:53] <oldlaptop> And command(s) that accept expressions as arguments (which include [expr], roughly analogous to lisp, and most control structures like if/while/for) use C's expression syntax with some extra operators, basically.

[22:34:56] <pyzozord> so it's like memory = {}; except that is syntactically not correct, so there is a filler 0
[22:35:16] <pyzozord> I'm not sure why 0 is allowed inside struct literals though
[22:35:40] <pyzozord> oh sorry that's not struct literal, that's array literal, well almost the same thing in this case

[22:47:02] <pyzozord> in the declaration with initalization I also though cast is not necessary

[22:50:03] <pyzozord> actually I don't know why it later needs the cast since it know what the type of x is

[23:35:34] <mrig> A call for more attention to 'how' things are done; The critique is of systems generally though, not only software, Vis the electronics bay in an aeroplane not having things correctly fastened. 
[23:35:37] <pyzozord> but I figured now he was saying "you don't take the job seriously enough [because you don't use system theory for architecture]"
[23:35:50] *** Joins: kron (~weechat@user/qaph)
[23:36:11] <pyzozord> good point, yes
[23:37:37] <mrig> Perhaps not applying the systems theory yes, but the guy that coded the cad program in asm is really fascinating, that the computers structure be written as an engineering and math solver tool at such a low level is really very cool.
[23:37:40] <pyzozord> regarding normal code I don't really know how I can make things more serious, beyod going full in on rust or ada or agda
[23:37:59] <pyzozord> and literally learning entire cs and applying it, but I don't think that last thing is possible
[23:38:02] <pyzozord> for me
[23:39:06] <mrig> There the comment seems to be that the entire design of a language could be based around a different model of a computer for a specific task. That this could also be done for programming perhaps? 
[23:39:36] <mrig> With the goal of making tools for systems design and engineering.
[23:39:49] <pyzozord> i don't really connect those two points of his talk, seriouseness and doing programming a different way
[23:39:54] <pyzozord> for me they seem completly unrelated
[23:40:15] *** Quits: collectivenectar (~collectiv@user/collectivenectar) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:40:22] <pyzozord> i don't really get a cohesive story he is tryig to tell
[23:41:06] <pyzozord> I get more "take it seriously and use system theory. Also use cads for programming"
[23:41:44] <mrig> the cad example was just an example of how another system has been built.
[23:41:53] <mrig> and very early on too.
[23:42:38] <mrig> Seems to be the case that this may be where he got his interest in communication parts or objects from though.

[23:43:28] <pyzozord> i did not make that connection before
[23:43:29] <mrig> communicating parts rather.
[23:44:11] <mrig> yes see all the objects in the bridge structure working as it models being put under tension?
[23:44:48] <pyzozord> so it's has two meanings 1) "use cad(-like) system for programming" 2) "see how cad is a great example of distributed sytem"
[23:45:29] <mrig> A computer being used to simulate a system before building it, it is then said that programmers make better tools for other domains than they do for their own.
[23:45:31] <pyzozord> I don't know if they are really cads, I'm talking about these graphical programs with nodes and solvers etc
[23:45:53] <mrig> cad just means computer aided design.
[23:46:06] <pyzozord> good point
[23:46:49] <mrig> He makes the point about how we fall in love with our dreams about what representations of things are too :)
[23:47:10] *** Joins: thesemicolons (~thesemico@user/thesemicolons)
[23:47:27] <mrig> Well I'm romanticising with the falling in love with our preconceived ideas part :D
[23:47:35] <pyzozord> i thought that was just explanation of why people stick with old ways of programming like c++ or java, or python
[23:48:06] <mrig> Sure yes, similar kind of thing.

[23:49:46] <mrig> pyzozord: well if I tried to watch a talk in Polish, I'd come away with far less I can assure you :D

[23:51:40] <pyzozord> oh ok, I didn't know that
[23:52:21] <pyzozord> didn't really have trouble parsing english in his talk

[23:56:22] <pyzozord> or jon
[23:56:24] <pyzozord> possibly both
[23:56:45] <pyzozord> or at least they have friends who worked on this game
[23:57:08] <user51> mrig: now you got spilers tho
[23:57:12] <mrig> cool dialog.
[23:57:14] <user51> i warned you. still a very good game.
[23:57:53] <user51> great music too
[23:58:01] <pyzozord> this game was made with passion, and was under the parent company owned by Jon Romero, one of the two programmers working on Doom and Quake
