[00:03:12] <Robomot> Jordan Peterson: Why I am no longer a tenured professor at the University of Toronto | National Post (The appalling ideology of diversity, inclusion and equity is demolishing education and business)
[00:03:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do believe we were only recently looking at that very Konstantin Yuon painting
[00:04:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In his speech-manifesto, Putin listed point by point the ideas in the West that he challenges. In a way, in his speech, Putin tries to outline what Russian anti-liberal philosopher Alexander Dugin calls the "Fourth Political Theory." Dugin classifies three political theories in order of appearance that characterized the 20th century: liberalism (the first theory), communism (the second theory), and fascism (the third theory).
[00:04:52] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Fascism emerged later than the other major political theories and disappeared before them. The alliance between liberalism and communism, in combination with Adolf Hitler's geopolitical miscalculations, were responsible for the demise of fascism. Fascism's disappearance cleared the battlefield for the first and the second political theories, whose Cold War duel created a bipolar world that lasted nearly half-a-century. The
[00:04:52] <Obormot\Arcturus>  1991 collapse of the Soviet Union signaled the victory of liberalism over communism. Thus, by the end of the 20th century, liberalism remained the only theory standing."
[00:04:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "However, liberalism itself has become increasingly decadent. "Today's liberalism is so rotten within that it's easy enough to throw out now, because it itself has recognized progress, freedom, and development to be absolute fictions. Liberalism has recognized that it is a kind of particular totalitarian approach. Behind all these ideas of liberation, freedom, equality, individualism, etc., stands none other than the will to
[00:04:57] <Obormot\Arcturus>  power," Dugin explains. Therefore, to avoid backsliding into communism and fascism, Dugin suggests that a Fourth Political Theory is needed, based on the rejection of post-modernism, the post-industrial society, liberal thought realized in practice, and globalism. Hence, one of the first steps towards a Fourth Political Theory is the "global rehabilitation of tradition."[5]"
[00:05:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh no, Putin's people have been reading Moldbug
[00:05:44] <kuudes> hmm, indeed it might be fitting to label cold war world as bipolar, for more reasons than one
[00:05:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Yet, Putin not only determines in his speech that liberalism is not the "end of history", but also shows similarities between liberalism (or more accurately progressive liberalism) and communism, ironically echoing anti-Kremlin conservative Polish philosopher and politician Ryszard Legutko's book, "The Demon In Democracy.""
[00:05:59] <gwern> '"This, I believe, should call to mind some of what we are witnessing now. Looking at what is happening in a number of Western countries, we are amazed to see the domestic practices which we, fortunately, have left, I hope in the distant past.

[00:14:33] <feepbot> <gwern> 'it's long been known that people who do not show signs of actual leukemia can harbor one or more of these driver mutations. Some of these people do indeed go on to develop MPNs, which suggests that there might be a longer "multi-hit" process that could go on for many years. This work supports that idea. The team studies twelve MPN patients, whose tissue samples provided
[00:14:34] <feepbot> over a thousand different clones of malignant blood cells. Sequencing these turned up over 580,000 mutations (!), and the paper puts these into a phylogenetic framework to reconstruct the sequence of what the key mutations were and when they might have taken place. Using rates of mutation as a clock, some of them appear to go back even to before birth the key JAK2V617F mutation,
[00:14:34] <feepbot> long associated with these malignancies, is estimated to have shown up anywhere from the 33rd week of gestation up to the age of 11. The DNMT3 mutation, similarly, seems to have appeared from the 8th week of gestation (!) out to about the age of 8. Additional driver mutations layer on top of these early events over the years to come the mean latency between the JAK2 mutation and
[00:14:39] <feepbot> diagnosis of cancer, for example, was about thirty years.' https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/long-slow-process-carcinogenesis

[00:16:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Well, if someone likes this, let them do it. I have already mentioned that, in shaping our approaches, we will be guided by a healthy conservatism. That was a few years ago, when passions on the international arena were not yet running as high as they are now, although, of course, we can say that clouds were gathering even then. Now, when the world is going through a structural disruption, the importance of reasonable
[00:16:16] <Obormot\Arcturus>  conservatism as the foundation for a political course has skyrocketed – precisely because of the multiplying risks and dangers, and the fragility of the reality around us."
[00:16:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> So

[00:17:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> The new conservatism will also be a Russian inwention
[00:17:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pavel Chekov was right about everything!
[00:17:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Great, there you have it then
[00:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Putin has smartly introduced himself into the debate that already exists in the Western world about liberalism, and more specifically progressive liberalism. If Putin manages to outline a new conservative ideology, then Russia would become a political and ideological pole for conservatives also in the U.S. and Europe. This is already partly happening in some European countries. Ironically, we could witness a new Cold War, but
[00:18:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  with reversed roles: the West would be a pole for progressive-liberal-communist ideology while Russia would represent the conservative pole. Even more ironically, Eastern European countries that rebelled against the Soviet Union, mainly Hungary and Poland, now have conservative elected governments that in the future may look at Moscow as an ideological point of reference." ... lol. exactly

[09:35:47] <PapuaHardyNet> https://ianthehenry.com/posts/kyria-build/a-wireless-ergonomic-keyboard/
[09:35:47] <Robomot> Kyria Build, Part 1: A wireless ergonomic keyboard (I built a new keyboard recently. It looks like this: / It has some interesting features: / It’s entirely wireless (the left half speaks Bluetooth to the right half, and the right half speaks Bluetooth to my computer). / The bottom of the case is tapped for standard 1/4-20 tripod-mounting threads. / The bottom of the case also has some very strong rare-earth …)
[09:41:19] <spxtr> Neat build. I personally don't think keyboards need to be wireless in general, but it looks like that person puts theirs on their chair's arms, which is neat.
[09:45:56] <quanticle> The left half speaks Bluetooth to the right half and the right half speaks Bluetooth to my computer...
[09:45:58] <quanticle> Oh boy, because I love having *different* amounts of latency depending on which half of the keyboard I'm typing on.
[09:46:12] <spxtr> I highly doubt that the latency is noticable :P
[09:48:25] <spxtr> (bluetooth is terrible for audio for various reasons involving agreeing on codecs, but I don't think it's bad for keyboards)
[09:48:40] <quanticle> It depends. I doubt it's noticeable in the normal case, but I'm assuming they're using Bluetooth Low Energy, and I've noticed that BLE devices can have some crazy latency spikes when they're waking up out of idle. So unless you're typing all the time, get ready for latency.
[09:48:42] <quanticle> But, on the other hand, maybe that's not really a problem. Maybe you use i3, Pentadactyl and vim. So in that case, your keyboard never idles and you never get latency.
[09:49:47] <spxtr> mechanical keyboard enthusiasts spend absurd amounts of money on really nice cables
[09:49:55] <quanticle> For the record, I have a Logitech mouse that speaks bluetooth and if I haven't been using it for a while, I have to wave it around a bunch and the cursor moves very erratically as it wakes up.
[09:50:11] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[09:52:11] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: "Wake up you POS" mouse: "uuhhh... what's your problem man, I was having a nice nap"
[09:53:29] <quanticle> Okay, first of all, I would never be that rude to my mouse. Look, it's a good boy, it's trying its best.
[09:54:06] <adiabatic> that reminds me, I should charge up my white wedge
[09:54:30] <adiabatic> overnight would probably be too much, but maybe during lunch tomorrow or this weekend
[09:55:35] <quanticle> The nice thing about this Logitech is that it runs off a AA battery. None of this charging nonsense.
[09:55:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> M510?
[09:55:58] <spxtr> I have a logitech g pro wireless and it is excellent. lasts weeks on a charge.
[09:56:06] <adiabatic> my old one ran on a pair of (rechargeable) AAs. That was fine. The one I have now is fine, too.
[09:56:20] <spxtr> AAs are a bit heavy for a mouse.
[09:56:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heavy?!
[09:56:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> What the heck?
[09:57:10] <adiabatic> Yes. Heavy. My old Intellimouse Optical is much lighter than two AAs.
[09:57:19] <spxtr> evidently I've disrupted the beast that is obormot
[09:57:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> If AAs are too heavy for your mouse then your mouse is too small
[09:58:08] <adiabatic> My mouse is just the right weight for a million household uses.
[09:58:12] <adiabatic> Plus, I'm special-needs.
[09:58:50] <adiabatic> In addition to being left-handed.
[09:58:58] <adiabatic> Or at least mousing left-handed.
[10:00:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> AAs are just the right weight
[10:00:30] <spxtr> I do prefer a pretty small mouse though, that's true. At some point I started clawing the mouse, which I guess is not normal.
[10:00:45] <adiabatic> claw grip is a thing.
[10:00:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> a bad thing!
[10:01:08] <spxtr> it feels very natural to me, but I accept that it is abnormal
[10:02:07] <spxtr> oh, looking at pictures, I do more of a "fingertip grip" than a claw
[10:02:26] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Logitech M650L: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KX9P829
[10:02:28] <quanticle> As far as I can tell, it's basically the successor to the M510. It's a bit bigger too (hence the "L" designation), so it's more comfortable.
[10:02:35] <Robomot> Amazon.com: Logitech Signature M650 L Full Size Wireless Mouse - for Large Sized Hands, 2-Year Battery, Silent Clicks, Customizable Side Buttons, Bluetooth, Multi-Device Compatibility - Black : Everything Else (Amazon.com: Logitech Signature M650 L Full Size Wireless Mouse - for Large Sized Hands, 2-Year Battery, Silent Clicks, Customizable Side Buttons, Bluetooth, Multi-Device Compatibility - Black : …)
[10:02:39] <adiabatic> I like lightweight, left-handable, and low-force clicks. Also at least four buttons plus a scrollwheel. I'm kind of uncertain what I'll do when all my Intellimice Optical die.
[10:03:26] <spxtr> logitech g pro wireless matches that. It's symmetric, you can change the thumb buttons from one side to the other as you like
[10:03:40] <adiabatic> Oh, and wired.
[10:04:00] <spxtr> ah. I do wired for literally everything else except for the mouse
[10:04:19] <adiabatic> Wireless is perfectly acceptable for secondary pointing devices.
[10:04:45] <quanticle> Yeah, but the Logitech G Pro is also like a hundred bucks, whereas this is $39.99.
[10:05:10] <spxtr> if it's any use: I used to use a wired mouse and was hesitant to get a wireless one, but the fact that it is wireless is completely unnoticable in almost all cases
[10:05:12] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[10:05:39] <spxtr> there is no noticable latency if you keep the receiver close, and it lasts for weeks without charging
[10:05:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The thing to understand is that if "wireless" means "Bluetooth" then it is bad
[10:06:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if "wireless" means "proprietary transceiver" then it's fine
[10:06:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Interesting
[10:06:15] <quanticle> This one can operate off Bluetooth, or it can operate off Logitech's proprietary transceiver.
[10:06:23] <quanticle> And it can switch on the fly
[10:06:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: And you say this is even bigger than the 510??
[10:06:43] <quanticle> Actually let me see.
[10:06:43] <spxtr> the g pro wireless is not bluetooth
[10:07:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: This doesn't have left/right scroll?? But the 510 does...
[10:08:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V0IHUO6GXE0A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09KX9P829 ... this review from a 510 user does not inspire me with confidence
[10:08:43] <Robomot> Comfortable mouse, but overly sensitive buttons
[10:09:31] <quanticle> Okay, it's not bigger than M510, it's the same size
[10:09:47] <quanticle> Oh, yeah, it doesn't have the left-right scroll, but that wasn't really an important feature for me.
[10:09:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> It really seems like this is not better than the 510 in any way
[10:10:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And is, if anything, worse
[10:10:17] <quanticle> One battery, not two, and it can be connected to two devices.
[10:10:26] <quanticle> (Albeit one of them via bluetooth)
[10:10:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[10:10:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not convinced the "one battery" thing is important
[10:10:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, at all
[10:10:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> AAs aren't exactly pricy
[10:11:02] <quanticle> I can leave the transceiver connected to my personal desktop and switch it over to bluetooth when I need to use it with my work laptop
[10:11:11] <adiabatic> "one battery" is important for weight sticklers
[10:11:11] <quanticle> For maximum lazy
[10:11:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> :/
[10:11:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> What I should do is buy like three or four more 510s
[10:11:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> In case they discontinue it
[10:12:01] <quanticle> Yeah, maybe
[10:26:45] <adiabatic> I am in favor of buying a bunch of things like mice in case they get discontinued
[10:26:58] <adiabatic> dozens of Model M enthusiasts can't all be wrong
[10:27:18] <phill> I have the Razer basilisk v3
[10:27:20] <quanticle> Or math professors hoarding that one brand of Japanese chalk
[10:27:38] <phill> I like the automatically free-flowing scroll wheel
[10:28:09] <quanticle> phill: I have a Razer DeathAdder, but I don't really game that much any more, and the wireless mouse doesn't have a cable that drags on the edge of my mousepad.
[10:28:35] <quanticle> The DeathAdder is *comfy* mouse, though
[10:30:34] <phill> Does the drag annoy you or mess up the mousepad?
[10:30:59] <saturn2> bluetooth can be okay as long as the transmitter and receiver are both made by the same manufacturer and so have mutually compatible bugs
[10:31:32] <phill> I don't get the appeal unless it's like long distance?

[10:31:58] <phill> It's not worth the premium imo

[10:59:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[10:59:09] <saturn2> raid is not a backup
[10:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> No of course not
[10:59:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I assumed enterprisey was asking how he should set up his backup volume as a RAID
[10:59:40] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, how does raid relate to stuff like zfs pools?
[10:59:43] <saturn2> oh okay
[11:00:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> If the question was instead "how should I set up my actual main working volume as a RAID, because I think this is tantamount to having my data backed up"
[11:00:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then the answer is "it's not"
[11:01:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, apparently Apple put RAID functionality back into Disk Utility in macOS Sierra? After removing it in El Capitan
[11:01:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wonder if they've re-removed it since, heh
[11:02:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Still only 0 and 1 though, lame)
[11:05:27] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: raid operates "underneath" a normal filesystem, providing a virtual drive that's more reliable and/or faster. zfs has raid-like features built in so you get the same benefits, but it's somewhat more slick and efficient since the filesystem can see the real drives
[11:05:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: ZFS has its own volume management which is kind of like running a software RAID
[11:06:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note that "efficient" here has a specific meaning - it's less efficient in certain ways, like memory usage)
[11:08:27] <quanticle> >I just want a backup
[11:08:30] <PapuaHardyNet> sweet! sounds like raid and zfs both have their use cases
[11:08:33] <quanticle> I hope you were trolling with that statement
[11:08:47] <quanticle> RAID improves availability
[11:08:58] <quanticle> It is not a substitute for a proper backup strategy
[11:09:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: lol we already had this mini-convo
[11:09:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I would say "scroll up" but it hasn't even scrolled offscreen!

[11:09:39] <quanticle> I was triggered, okay!
[11:10:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: ZFS is not something you use on your home box, in practice
[11:10:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: It's for storage servers of various descriptions
[11:10:14] <quanticle> Yeah, but if you're configuring a specific backup server...
[11:10:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[11:11:34] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Though, I will note that using ZFS and RAID at the same time is not a good idea.

[13:42:15] <PapuaHardyNet> How does the Bitter Lesson take into account the fact that non-scalable solutions are sometimes not only viable, but necessary, in certain domains?
[13:42:56] <PapuaHardyNet> so for example, curating a reading list is almost always better than leveraging search and learning for optimizing for information or even high quality reads
[13:43:28] <PapuaHardyNet> recommendations from people in your social circle are almost always better than suggestions by search and recommendation systems
[13:44:35] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps the answer is that the methods that leverage computation - search and learning - are not good enough in comparison to these non-scalable methods YET

[17:09:50] <PapuaHardyNet> question is, what does the Scaling Hypothesis imply that is also a paradigm changer? The fact that there's no fire alarm for AGI? The fact that AGI is going to be "sooner than expected"?
[17:10:20] <PapuaHardyNet> both, yes. But I'm sure there's more.
[17:11:45] <PapuaHardyNet> one clear implication is that "robowaifus" is impossible. by the time robowaifus is even possible, AGI is certain
[17:12:12] <PapuaHardyNet> ubiquitous robowaifus implies that we have solved the AI alignment problem, and *that* is very, very unlikely given our current trajectory

[18:25:35] <PapuaHardyNet> if you asked me, I'd generally say that a 1T would be enough BUT the biggest bottleneck is the lack of "memory". a language model by itself is very much inadequate for simulating a person

[22:09:00] <zebrask> I'm mildly surprised how low is the percentage of people who want to migrate from basically all of asia.
[22:10:51] <zebrask> Anti-immigration rhetoric would have it that if we opened our borders all of China and India would just empty out directly into the US.
[22:12:35] <kuudes> true
[22:12:45] <adiabatic> several years ago something like 45% of all Mexicans would move to the US given the opportunity
[22:13:12] <zebrask> I mean 8% of India + China is still 220M people, which is a lot, but I wouldn't expect the per capita desire to migrate out of those places to be lower than like, the EU or Australia.
[22:14:56] <kuudes> I think exiting china is nontrivial
[22:15:12] <kuudes> don't you need an exit passport for that or something?
[22:15:43] <adiabatic> probably lots of people china wouldn't mind leaving
[22:16:23] <adiabatic> surplus low-value men, if nothing else
[22:16:45] <zebrask> The way it's worded on that page makes it sound like they're asking you to ignore practical details like visas and whatnot: "Ideally, if you had the opportunity, would you like to move PERMANENTLY to another country, or would you prefer to continue living in this country?"
[22:18:11] <zebrask> Possibly people in those countries are not interpreting it that way, and are interpreting it more like, "Realistically would you like to go through a green card lottery or equivalent in one of the countries that would take you?"
[22:19:54] <zebrask> Or maybe it's harder for people in those countries to go back and forth, so they are tempering their enthusiasm to migrate with adding a huge amount of friction to interact with anyone in their pre-migration life.
[22:20:55] <zebrask> Or maybe it's just capitalist propoganda that everyone wants to live in America and most people actually really prefer living in their home countries. 😅
