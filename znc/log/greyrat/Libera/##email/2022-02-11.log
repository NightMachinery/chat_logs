[14:12:33] <masber> hi, Im a noob in regards email technologies but would like to ask, I have a java application which talks to postfix (SMTP) in order to send an email, I check /var/log/maillog on the server running the java application (smtp client) and I can see this `Feb  6 10:00:09 mail sendmail[4042]: 216A05mA004040: to=<--REDACTED-->, delay=00:00:04,
[14:12:34] <masber> xdelay=00:00:03, mailer=esmtp, pri=151114, relay=aspmx.l.google.com. [142.251.12.27], dsn=2.0.0, stat=Sent (OK  1644141609 2si6309344pli.34 - gsmtp)` this means the email was sent and the recipient mail server accept it, is this right?
[14:13:26] <masber> also, what does 1644141609 means? is this the size of the email in terms of bits? can I use this number to find out if the email had an attachment?
[14:14:44] <masber> and what is the role of the relay (aspmx.l.google.com.) here?
[14:18:28] <BranchPredictor> 1. yes, it was accepted
[14:19:12] <BranchPredictor> 2. that number can mean anything, other server may just respond with short "OK"
[14:20:02] *** Quits: masber (~masber@213.55.225.47) (Quit: Client closed)
[14:26:44] <pj> I think it's an epoch timestamp, which corresponds to Sun 06 Feb 2022 10:00:09 UTC
[14:27:28] <pj> in fact since it's the exact time that is displayed elsewhere in the message, I would say that's exactly what it is.
[14:28:05] *** Joins: masber (~masber@213.55.225.47)
[14:28:21] <pj> masber: it's a unix time stamp that corresponds to Sun 06 Feb 2022 10:00:09 UTC
[14:29:16] <masber> i see, ok, thank you! so there is no way I can get the amount of data transfered or the email data size through mailog?
[14:30:02] <pj> I honestly don't know, you may be able to get sendmail to log it, but tbh I'm much more familiar with postfix so I couldn't tell you how to do it.
[14:30:53] <pj> masber: there is a #sendmail channel, although it only has 15 people in it so you may not get much help there.

[14:31:38] <BranchPredictor> I think he actually uses postfix
[14:31:44] <masber> oh, I use postfix
[14:32:32] <BranchPredictor> my postfix does log sth like this:
[14:32:53] <BranchPredictor> Feb 11 09:38:19 predictor postfix/qmgr[14383]: 94651C2288: from=<derpderpderp>, size=29925, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
[14:33:16] <BranchPredictor> you could parse it and use the "size=" field

[14:33:40] <masber> interesting, so I need to check if the postfix I use can be configured to log the size
[14:33:59] <masber> thank you!
[14:34:18] <BranchPredictor> make sure you're actually running postfix and not sendmail
[14:35:12] <masber> ok, so I need to find out the process listening on port 25
[14:38:00] <masber> yes, you are right, I was mistaken. I am using sendmail
[14:39:27] <pj> yes, your log entry clearly says sendmail.
