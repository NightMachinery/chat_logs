[13:57:42] <user51> what are the 5 most annoying things in awk?
[13:58:13] *** Joins: earnestly (~earnest@user/earnestly)
[13:58:15] <user51> well, just some annoying things in awk would suffice.
[13:58:33] <user51> compound data structures are kinda meh, gawk fixes some of it with multidimensional arrays though.
[13:58:40] <user51> substr() gets old fast.
[13:59:03] <user51> locals, too
[14:00:01] <user51> array[whatever] creating a new 'whatever' element
[14:00:39] <user51> my bad: i meant 'nested' rather than 'compound'
[14:00:51] <user51> getline is also abit disappointing

[14:25:54] <user51> i started learning python just to get a new perspective
[14:26:26] <user51> i didn't realize how awesome is awk's implicit read loop
