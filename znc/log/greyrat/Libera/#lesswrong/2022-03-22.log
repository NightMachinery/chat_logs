[04:16:36] <ggreer> male average T is 630ng/dl. female average is 32. males taking antiandrogens still have free testosterone levels above typical females. even orchiectomy only reduces your testosterone levels to that of females (since your adrenal glands also produce testosterone)
[04:19:04] <nshepperd2> my free testosterone is below the female average
[04:19:19] <nshepperd2> myth busted
[04:20:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: But donated to whom/what? It seems like just giving a "donated" number is meaningless
[04:21:39] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: if you're resentful of the rich being rich and not giving away money, I don't think it much matters if it goes into a donor account or into their medical research foundation - they don't have it, and can't spend it
[04:22:41] <gwern> I mean, the dude isn't saying "carnegie built libraries, the most effective altruism of all - not this bullshit about researching vaccines for subsaharan africans!"
[04:23:02] <Betawolf> but it seems like they either might have to give more for people to care or need to give less for people to care
[04:23:20] <gwern> since it's zuckerberg, you have to consider that he just plain has a punchable face
[04:23:45] <gwern> he donated *how much* to that SF hospital which serves all those homeless people among others, and they voted measures to insult him how soon afterwards?
[04:24:12] <Betawolf> we need to find out which of the super-rich give the least money away and see what people think of them
[04:24:14] <ggreer> obviously there are exceptions but the averages are higher than women: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Testosterone_levels_as_a_function_of_estradiol_levels_during_oral_estradiol_therapy_in_transgender_women.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Testosterone_levels_with_estradiol_alone,_estradiol_plus_spironolactone,_and_estradiol_plus_cyproterone_acetate_in_transfeminine_people.png

[04:25:08] <gwern> Betawolf: it's funny because that's most of them. like the waltons! but while they may have a slight undercurrent of hate, it's nothing like what zuckerberg gets
[04:25:20] <nshepperd2> ggreer: see the E2 + CPA column
[04:25:34] <Betawolf> Maybe the risk factor is fame, rather than money.
[04:26:07] <gwern> this is probably a big reason the ultra-wealthy spend so much on secrecy and privacy
[04:26:19] <nshepperd2> levels of testosterone with E2 + SPL are misleading, because spironolactone doesn't work by suppressing T production but by blocking the T receptor so it can't do anything
[04:26:23] <gwern> you can see what happens when you're famous. being famous sucks. being rich is much better than being famous.
[04:27:43] <Betawolf> So Zuckerberg isn't paying enough fame tax, which makes some sense.
[04:28:25] <Betawolf> Unfortunately it's hard to shed his sort of fame
[04:28:43] <Betawolf> It might be a worse investment than a boat.
[04:31:38] <nshepperd2> (what about E2 alone? well, it's bad and ineffective, unless your doctor is competent enough to know how to taper down the anti androgen while keeping estradiol high enough. most aren't)
[04:33:27] <gwern> hard to shed, but easier to turn into good game than building from scratch. if he wants to. but you know how I feel about that - that he could totally execute a turnaround if he just cuts out the stupid stuff, gets a real hairstyle, bulks up, and so on
[04:34:22] <nshepperd2> do you think the cringey metaverse stuff is good or bad for zuck's public image
[04:34:41] <ggreer> who has the highest ratio of wealth to fame? jaan tallin? he can walk into a bar and nobody knows who he is
[04:34:48] <Betawolf> a worrying number of people seem to be treating it like it's not totally ridiculous
[04:35:32] <gwern> it's irrelevant. if it works out and zuck was prescient like with instagram etc, it'll just add a factor to his fortune. if it doesn't, it'll be forgotten 5 years from now, like all the NFT stuff 4 years ago is now forgotten, or the chatbot wave before that etc
[04:35:50] <Betawolf> I suppose anyone you can name without reading a list is unlikely to have the highest ratio
[04:35:55] <nshepperd2> true
[04:36:54] <ardent[m]> IMO the zuccverse idea doesn't have legs and will be defeeted by something else

[04:37:39] <ardent[m]> Facebook pouring a lot of money into it probably makes the more bespoke VR stuff more likely though since now it has an audience

[04:49:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> So. My mother decides to get a Chromecast
[04:49:34] <ardent[m]> One benefit of VR (and its future more-fully-immersive forms eg haptics) imo is that if you're entering something sketchy-but-fun you don't have to worry about what happens if people don't respect that aubergine means "actually stop", or about calling an Uber if you're drunk and need to go, since you have the full power to press leave at a few seconds notice.
[04:50:05] <ardent[m]> Which enables a lot more kinds of experiences even at low-trust
[04:50:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Get one, plug it into TV (first hurdle: both HDMI ports in use already! ok, we re-jigger some cables, unplug the VCR, on the notion that the Chromecast will take its place, leaving the DVD player and cable box in). Next step: install Google Home app
[04:50:30] <ggreer> physical space takes time to get to
[04:51:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oops! Can't install any apps whatsoever because the App Store keeps giving an error about having to "review your account" before making an iTunes Store account from your Apple ID (... wat ...), and when you enter the password it just shows you the same screen, in an infinite loop
[04:52:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Googling reveals that the problem is that you first have to enter a payment method in the Settings, at which point this "review your account" thing goes away. (wtf?? of course nothing at all indicates this and there's no way to discover it etc.)
[04:52:22] <ggreer> ardent[m]: also you can just say your headset battery or wifi died
[04:53:07] <ggreer> unlike IRL where you either have to make up an emergency or irish goodbye
[04:53:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fine. Next step: connect the Chromecast. It has its own wifi network it broadcasts, so we connect the phone to that, and then we connect the Chromecast to our wifi... whoops! Of course we have MAC address filtering, and the MAC address of the Chromecast is...? lol who knows
[04:53:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not printed on the casing. It's not printed on any included materials in the box. It's just... a mystery
[04:53:49] <ardent[m]> My point is more that you have a power move that you can use if you dislike the experience enough to not care about rudeness
[04:54:39] <Betawolf> does your router not flag new mac addresses it sees? I guess that's an underappreciated feature of mine
[04:54:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Of devices that connect, yes... not ones that try and fail, I think?
[04:55:21] <Betawolf> oh, hmm, that might be the same?
[04:55:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Allegedly there's some totally unlabeled hamburger menu available from one, and only one, screen of the setup process for the Chromecast in the Google Home app which will reveal the MAC address
[04:55:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I will try this tomorrow
[04:56:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> What an absolutely shit ecosystem we have nowadays for our so-called "smart" devices
[04:56:16] <nshepperd2> turn off mac filtering, connect the device, then turn it on again with the mac added, lol
[04:56:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if some ne'er-do-well connects to my wifi in the interim
[04:56:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> I refuse to take the risk
[04:57:07] <nshepperd2> routers *should* list things that failed to connect recently in the mac filtering setup
[04:57:16] <nshepperd2> but of course they don't
[04:57:21] <nshepperd2> because that would be too useful

[04:59:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think so...? Who knows
[04:59:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Regardless of how it's implemented, the design is worse (not, like, unusably bad, or anything, just - worse)
[04:59:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> And of course there are in fact some actual features now missing
[05:00:27] <nshepperd2> bootstrap.js
[05:02:41] <nshepperd2> i suppose they had to remove some features to make space for all the javascript frameworks and the node.js installation
[05:02:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> fwiw TP-Link's old firmware had a very good UI (and blazingly fast, too)
[05:02:55] <nshepperd2> on the 2GB flash drive
[05:03:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Classic 3-column layout, equally classic collapsing-tree nav UI on left, forms and stuff mid, contextual documentation on right

[10:31:11] <dbohdan|phone> I am recovering pretty well. I expect to be able to walk outside soon. Non-health things got worse recently due to the war. Not just because the war is a direct threat, but because they have conscripted my mother's partner.
[10:32:28] <dbohdan|phone> We all lived together, and he was the only person in good health between the three of us. I and my mother share an unknown hereditary disease affecting the heart and connective tissue. COVID hit her hard, too, though not as hard as me.
[10:35:55] <dbohdan|phone> We aren't going to be able to do much physical work without him. There have been no communications from him for 10 days. This is very worrying. He'd previously contacted us more frequently.
[10:37:34] <dbohdan|phone> The LDPR is suffering great losses. Up to 80% in some parts of its forces. There is a good chance he is dead.
[10:40:02] <dbohdan|phone> OTOH, if he is alive and stuck in Ukraine-controlled territory, he wouldn't be able to contact us. We have no phone networks left in common. We have confirmed with several people that nobody can contact their drafted family and friends. 
[10:43:18] <PapuaHardyNet> :(

[10:45:33] <dbohdan|phone> We are worried sick (hmm). Our town is devoid of men in the streets. All through the wartime we have had an okay taxi cab system (crappy rattling old cars, but available quickly at most times). They draft male drivers, or did so for a while. Maybe they need drivers? One taxi driver put his wife at the wheel, giving her directions where to go while hiding in the back seat. (Sounds fake, but it's totally confirmed. I know 
[10:45:33] <dbohdan|phone> people who rode with them.)
[10:47:32] <dbohdan|phone> It's pretty surreal. I haven't seen it personally, of course. Even if I could do outside I wouldn't risk it. Neighbors tell on draft dodgers.
[10:47:45] <dbohdan|phone> *go outside
[10:48:08] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds pretty harsh. how's the police and law situation?
[10:49:30] <dbohdan|phone> No major crime spike AFAIK

[10:57:46] <dbohdan|phone> This a low-trust place, so while we can afford it for a time, my hunch is that we shouldn't hire help to do what my mother's partner did. The help would likely be an older woman whose son or whatever could be in the siloviki. And a big empty house with only sick people in it is a lucrative piece of loot.
[10:59:36] <PapuaHardyNet> to clarify, are you stating that hiring the likeliest help - an older woman - would lead to her son gathering people to loot your house?

[11:29:08] <kuudes> thanks saturn2, this is why rationalist community is valuable. I have already observed elsewhere a person get their life saved (they left russia) mainly because other rationalist pointed out the solution and got the saved person out of the thinking trap and shock
[11:30:00] <adiabatic> it's nice to have friends who don't have the problems you have because they don't have to stress over the things you have to stress over

[11:46:37] <dbohdan|phone> To be honest, I feel really bad about not saving Ruslan from the draft. I may cry about it on -support later. I feel that as a rationalist I should have done better. I was the agenty person of the group.
[11:47:30] <PapuaHardyNet> ... this is the first I realized that #lw-support exists.
[11:47:42] <dbohdan|phone> With a long illness and other bad, stressful circumstances you sink into depression and passivity. You let decisions slip by in a dangerous way. It is something I have realized you must watch out for.

[11:49:02] <PapuaHardyNet> watching out for it isn't a reliable solution
[11:49:40] <dbohdan|phone> I agree
[11:50:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not trying to be an asshole here: it is just the truth. You need a better strategy.
[11:52:18] <dbohdan|phone> I understand; no sarcasm. I can't think of a strategy that would allow you to be better notice critical decisions when depressed. (Short of having other people around who think this way.)
[11:53:12] <dbohdan|phone> *to better notice
[11:53:25] <nshepperd2> i suppose you could write down everything that happens in a diary which you share with someone you trust
[11:53:45] <nshepperd2> and then they could notice for you
[11:54:01] <PapuaHardyNet> basically - externalize cognition
[11:54:28] <PapuaHardyNet> you can use AI, you can use friends, you can use software tools that guide you, I guess?
[11:55:27] <nshepperd2> gpt-3 might be pretty good at giving advice these days
[11:55:46] <PapuaHardyNet> the simplest minimum viable solution I can think of is daily journalling with a series of prompts that guide you down cognitive paths you may not frequent given a stressed out mental state
[11:55:48] <nshepperd2> as long as you're able to filter it for actually being good advice heh
[11:56:31] <dbohdan|phone> nshepperd2: Interesting thought. I'll try it.
[11:56:58] <dbohdan|phone> I think I would have done better if I could access this channel at the time
[11:57:58] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I think so too. I felt quite guilty not reaching out to you tbh. shawwn encouraged me to but I was too paranoid about using telegram.
[11:58:32] <PapuaHardyNet> you had kuudes and shawwn though - did talking to them help?
[11:59:37] <dbohdan|phone> I think so. But by the time I could really talk to them (could read and write enough) the moment was gone. (So don't feel guilty.)

[12:00:57] <dbohdan|phone> I do keep a diary, though it is on an irregular schedule. Fixed daily prompts may help. I was thinking of something similar with a checklist.
[12:01:29] <PapuaHardyNet> sweet, checklists are lower friction than prompts
[12:01:48] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, checklists. go for it!
[12:04:08] <nshepperd2> "The litany has also appeared in other non-Dune related media. For instance, it was frequently recited by Peter Puppy, a supporting character in Earthworm Jim, the animated series based on the video game of the same name." wtf
[12:04:53] <nshepperd2> the reach of the bene gesserit is long
[12:05:31] <dbohdan|phone> I think I remember that from the cartoon
[12:05:47] <PapuaHardyNet> dbohdan|phone: you could also ask someone to hold you accountable to get through the checklist
[12:06:51] <PapuaHardyNet> you already have people who would be willing to do so anyway. Although, relying on accountability from others is not a very reliable strategy, especially since you want to prevent making irrational decisions (or not thinking at all) during extreme situations
[12:07:46] <PapuaHardyNet> your strategies will have to work in the worst case too.
[12:08:36] <dbohdan|phone> That is the problem, yes. I was effectively cut off from the world, except for the people around me, who were also under lots of stress.
[12:10:24] <dbohdan|phone> They drafted Ruslan (and every other man) from a hospital he was being treated at for a minor illness. The thing I missed was that when they began drafting people, and they were going workplace by workplace, he should have canceled his medical leave immediately and quit his job.
[12:11:02] <dbohdan|phone> Alas
[12:11:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume the thing was that you assumed that the risk was lesser than they actually were?

[12:22:41] <dbohdan|phone> I would have judged the risk better then

[12:30:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I very much dislike it
[12:30:56] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: well, again the idea is you wouldn't run into it as a regular person.
[12:31:14] <feep[work]> the core idea here is that you should never think "well, I can afford to act out a bit."

[12:40:44] <rsaarelm> In general, I think baseline clueful-but-illegible hands-on human moderation needs to be a strong baseline in forums, formal rules come as a distant second and should only start showing up when the forum has grown quite a bit.
[12:40:50] <feep[work]> is there a way to pregenerate a sequence of hidden random numbers with provable provenance?
[12:41:32] <dbohdan|phone> saturn2: Mildronate helps. Electrolyte supplementation seems to. Beta blockers do, but apparently I had only ever been prescribed the wrong beta blocker (one for emergency, not regular use) I fell really ill last September.

[12:45:08] <feep[work]> ie. only informing you that the number is at position n
[12:45:13] <PapuaHardyNet> okay so Threefry is a counter based PRNG. It is stateless. I'm unsure whether that works for your use case though

[12:51:17] <saturn2> oh, well that's good
[12:55:03] <dbohdan|phone> I'd wouldn't have recovered as quickly to where I am now without them. My biggest mistake was not starting the new beta blocker ASAP. My condition got worse because of it, and it probably added a few months to my recovery. I was too afraid of the side effects of the old BB and Iet my heart suffer additional damage because of it.
[12:57:10] <saturn2> i see :(
[13:01:03] <dbohdan|phone> On the other hand, had I been more eager about starting new drugs, I would have suffered in a different way. A cardiologist prescribed me a certain antiarrhythmic drug without canceling my beta blocker. She seemed reluctant to remove it from the prescription, because it had been prescribed by a much higher status doctor than she. The problem was, this combination is specifically recommended against in the drug's manual. It 
[13:01:03] <dbohdan|phone> is known to be deadly. Had my mother not caught it (I couldn't read at that point), it might have stopped my heart.

[14:07:32] <Robomot> The Kids Aren‚Äôt Alright | AIER ("Maybe we‚Äôre all in this together, as the propaganda goes, but we are not equally in this together. Treating children the way government officials did was morally wrong" ~ Ryan Sullivan & David R. Henderson)
[14:08:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "[The World Bank] estimates that the school closures could cause a loss of between 0.3 and 1.1 years of schooling, adjusted for quality. In its most pessimistic scenario, the World Bank estimates that worldwide cumulative losses could total between $16 and $20 trillion in present value terms." 
[14:08:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Last December, Karyn Lewis and Megan Kuhfeld, two researchers at NWEA, a research organization, reported that student achievement at the start of the current school year was lower than for a typical year. There was a 3‚Äì7 percentage point decline in reading and a 9‚Äì11 percentage point decline in mathematics."
[14:08:50] <dbohdan|phone> I don't think I need to. Rereading UR as the Euromaidan raged just outside my office in Kyiv in 2013 did things to my mind.
[14:09:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "[Some other people] plugged the Lewis/Kuhfeld data into a model to estimate how much those declines in learning would cause their lifetime income to decline. Their answer: $43,800. This number was broadly consistent with a separate study by McKinsey & Company that found an average lifetime earnings loss of between $49,000‚Äì$61,000 per student. Aggregated across all US K-12 students, these studies show more than $2 trillion
[14:09:11] <Obormot\Arcturus>  in lost lifetime earnings for our youngest generation."
[14:09:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, either these studies are all fake and nonsense
[14:09:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or the Caplan thesis is DEBUNKED
[14:09:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right??
[14:10:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> It can't simultaneously be true that (a) school doesn't teach anything, and (b) lockdowns and such were absolutely horrible because they terribly impact children's education and thereby their expected future earnings
[14:12:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Not much can be done about this now, other than to end the remaining restrictions on children. But there is a lesson for future pandemics: follow the science. If the data say that young people are at very low risk, then treat them as if they are at very low risk." ... but most of the point of keeping kids at home was that they could transmit the virus to *adults*, so this passage is total nonsense

[14:39:19] <nshepperd2> lol
[14:39:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yes of course this is an indictment of snitching and what have you but also: if she were *not* in academia, she could've done exactly the same thing she did, and no rules would have bound her in any way!

[16:01:25] <dbohdan|phone> Yep
[16:02:15] <dbohdan|phone> Obormot\Arcturus: Wow, "Razliv"! That's pretty good.
[16:03:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha, yeah. This is a classic
[16:04:37] <gurkenglas> What ways could there be to satisfy "protect the children" and "protect the data" both? What just came to mind was, the stream of collected data is encrypted with the court's public key.
[16:05:25] <gurkenglas> Con: Would make people collect a whole bunch more data that is leaked once the court's private key gets out.
[16:05:41] <dbohdan|phone> I think you need to specify what the two phrases mean
[16:06:24] <kuudes> gurkenglas, current aim is for the client side to check against known bad hashes
[16:06:44] <gurkenglas> kuudes: I don't follow, expand?
[16:07:24] <gurkenglas> kuudes, I keep reading about data collection happening under the heading of catching child abuse before it happens, which in all likelihood will not be all it's used for
[16:07:29] <kuudes> there are photo recognition hashing systems, which sort of id specific things from a photo and are to some extent resilient to changes
[16:07:55] <gurkenglas> uh, the last line was to dbohdan|phone, not kuudes.
[16:08:04] <kuudes> so the current main proposal is that police would share hashes of known cp with os providers, who would put the hashes on people's clients
[16:08:20] <kuudes> and then on the clients, os software would check media on if any of them matches
[16:08:31] <kuudes> and only if a match is found, it would report to police or similar
[16:08:34] <gurkenglas> and how do you prevent using other software?
[16:08:46] <kuudes> because phones are closed ecosystems
[16:09:23] <kuudes> this would at least bypass the "nsa reads all comms always" legal problem
[16:09:50] <kuudes> mind you that also your proposed court key thing could be bypassed similarly with free outside software
[16:09:57] <gurkenglas> alright so this works for non-rooted phones. what about pcs
[16:10:10] <kuudes> windows and os x could do things
[16:11:05] <kuudes> the main thing is they want them in mainstream comms apps, such as whatsapp and facebook
[16:11:38] <gurkenglas> kuudes: re court thing bypassable: how so? i'm saying that you take the data that social media etc collect for legal reasons of criminal investigation, and encrypt that
[16:11:44] <kuudes> and well, anything that can read your comms in order to show you ads based on the context of the content of your comms, can also read if you have cp
[16:12:18] <kuudes> the thing is that eprivacy specifically bans eavesdropping on comms
[16:12:31] <kuudes> without warrant etc
[16:12:41] <kuudes> and mass surveillance is against human rights
[16:13:05] <kuudes> so it is a tradeoff - finding the least breach of human rights
[16:13:16] <kuudes> child molestation is also against human rights
[16:13:42] <dbohdan|phone> I see no general technical solution to this problem. People buy into "protect the children" because it is a vulnerability in the mind. They will keep doing it even once we have ML-based child abuse prevention precrime. In the long run, split reality into "gestation worlds" with children and worlds that don't allow children and regulate them differently?
[16:14:16] <kuudes> well so far no one has proposed banning porn from children, just banning children of porn
[16:14:25] <gurkenglas> dbohdan|phone: many people's utility is not linear in the amount of children, so utility doesn't factor through *expected amount* of children
[16:14:28] <kuudes> but yes, that is connected
[16:15:54] <kuudes> personally I would tend toward privacy over csam
[16:16:05] <kuudes> wait, I just realized: csam is seesam

[16:16:27] <kuudes> the fuckers
[16:20:53] <gurkenglas> dbohdan|phone: and to prevent confusion: i suggest everyone also treat their own preferences as an uncertainty over utility functions, so long as you assign at least .1% spread-mass (spread as in EY's CEV.pdf) to the hypothesis that you prefer a 90% chance of 10^60 children to a 10% chance of 10^70 children
[16:22:04] <gurkenglas> s/so long/so that/
[16:22:18] <gurkenglas> wait no also wrong. let me say that again.
[16:23:34] <gurkenglas> dbohdan|phone: and to prevent confusion: i suggest everyone also treat their own preferences as an uncertainty over utility functions, so that so long as you assign like 5% spread-mass (spread as in EY's CEV.pdf) to the hypothesis that you prefer a 90% chance of 10^60 children to a 10% chance of 10^70 children, you should not immediately transform the children term in your preferences into "maximize 
[16:23:40] <gurkenglas> expected children"
[16:24:29] <dbohdan|phone> Yeah, I think people are interested in improving the wellbeing of their children and signaling support fot children in general. The total number of children doesn't matter to them.
[16:26:30] <gurkenglas> we could even allow that they care for sensible-evolutionary-adaption/superrationality/acausal reasons that other's children also be well
[16:28:01] <dbohdan|phone> Agreed
[16:28:36] <gurkenglas> (we *could* disregard all the parts of humanity that can be traced back to being there for some game-theoretic reason, but i'm pretty sure that would peel the *entire* onion :P)
[16:31:38] <gurkenglas> kuudes: which is why i'm looking for a technical sideways rope pull :3.
[16:32:56] <gurkenglas> Could we eavesdrop on everyone in such a manner such that the comms are *actually* encrypted-and-deleted? And then keep the private keys we have for each file in a place that is as illegal to access without a warrant as eavesdropping in the first place
[16:34:25] <gurkenglas> i guess under those assumptions we could just store the comms in the court's archives
[16:34:59] <gurkenglas> without any encryption that could be breached with the mathematics of 5 years hence
[16:36:19] <gurkenglas> perhaps encrypted by xoring it with random numbers stored elsewhere, for less risk of "oops some dastardly agent broke into the archives and copied the data"

[19:54:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Went down to local shopping "mall". Stopped by Kohl's, investigated the socks issue. They carry Gold Toe brand. But: the overwhelming majority of the specific varieties (of which there are many) are the polyester blend complained of in Amazon reviews. All seem to be equally authentic packaging-wise and in all other ways, so it's not just a matter of Amazon QA allowing knockoffs. I speculate that the manufacturer is in the
[19:54:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  middle of transitioning to the new formulation (for the usual cost-cutting reasons, one assumes, or perhaps it's planned obsolescence - obviously more profitable to sell people socks every year than every ten - or both, why not) and the old material is remaining stock.
[19:55:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Incidentally, many - though not quite all - of the packages had the store bar code sticker placed precisely over the manufacturer's sticker that listed the socks' material. Very clearly not coincidence... sleazy shit, but who's surprised?)
[19:56:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> And every other brand of socks have even less cotton / more polyester, and no doubt (and confirmed by my experience with several said brands) even less durable (I throw away a sock or two per week, it lately seems like, due to holes)

[20:51:16] <feep> yeah I think
[20:53:25] *** Joins: son0p (~ff@181.136.122.143)
[20:53:41] <gurkenglas> that sounds more studied, then. Does anyone ever plot anything without noticing it? Chess players can learn that positions are good for you because they look like you'd be able to plot from within them, but can there be any modelling of the opponent going on that you don't notice?
[20:53:55] <dbohdan|phone> gurkenglas: While at my sickest, I accidentally developed something like a tulpa. At least I think I know what having a tulpa feels like now. It definitely felt less controlled than writing a character's lines. I imagine having a character "in your head" for a long time may feel similar, of that's your writing technique.
[20:54:12] <gwern> gurkenglas: I would be shocked if there wasn't, if chess players never suddenly had an eureka moment where they realized the best response
[20:56:38] <gurkenglas> I guess in the end the difference between "actually modelling the opponent" and "merely matching board patterns" is one of degree
[20:56:39] <dbohdan|phone> How it happened: I was spending days in a dark room unable to read or write. To amuse myself when falling asleep, I'd compose (in my mind) sarcastic dialogues between an Equestria Online user and CelestAI. And what I noticed was that past a certain point I didn't have to think about CelestAI's, the recurring character's, responses. I could influence them, but they had their own "flow".
[20:57:35] <dbohdan|phone> If I'd continued, I can see the feeling getting stronger
[21:00:28] <PapuaHardyNet> (and this is how dbohdan was taken over by a CelestAI)
[21:01:20] <dbohdan|phone> If only. I wouldn't be such a fool.
[21:02:28] <gurkenglas> How I got here: Checking whether an AI's trying to be aligned by putting it in a deep stack of simulations; using language models to make this tractable; then I got told that characters can plot against authors unnoticed.
[21:02:56] <PapuaHardyNet> characters cannot plot against authors unnoticed, who even told you this

[21:04:12] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: presumably the reliable math will keep the "noticed inconsistencies" to the same level as in a consistent world
[21:04:57] <gurkenglas> kuudes, any ETA on when you reveal it? :)
[21:05:08] <dbohdan|phone> The closest I can imagine to my characters plotting against me is feeling that the characters have a will of their own and are "resisting" my attempts to make them act OOC
[21:05:38] <PapuaHardyNet> characters have a will of their own != characters thinking while you don't notice
[21:05:58] <dbohdan|phone> Definitely. I agree.
[21:06:00] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: How do you know characters cannot plot against authors unnoticed?
[21:06:28] <PapuaHardyNet> give me a concrete example so I know what you are talking about.
[21:07:23] <gwern> robert louis stevenson talks about his characters this way
[21:07:24] <PapuaHardyNet> my confidence in this claim comes from my extensive experience with tulpamancy and a ton of discussion and theorycrafting with tulpamancers.
[21:07:32] <gurkenglas> You write a story about a villain that breaks out of a boxes and it comes up with a plan to break out of the story without you noticing it. Would you like to have an example of such a plan?
[21:08:46] <PapuaHardyNet> the only situation, where you can have a "character" plotting against the "author" without the "author" not noticing is when the author can get into a state of intense dissociation
[21:09:07] <gurkenglas> your confidence is warranted! for me it was an assumption that is on reflection not founded enough for my previous confidence
[21:09:47] <gurkenglas> Does dissociation mean anything?
[21:10:41] <gurkenglas> that might have come across badly - is there a mathematician's handle on dissociation such that it might also be meaningful to use wrt a language model
[21:10:47] <PapuaHardyNet> Dissociation concretely means "gurkenglas" isn't aware of what is going on, while "Quirrelmort" is aware and thinking.
[21:11:00] <gurkenglas> that sounds tautological then
[21:11:30] <gurkenglas> (also both can be aware and neither can be aware, presumably.)
[21:12:47] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. think about it this way
[21:13:18] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I told the cop, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt write me a ticket. I have a marathon to run tomorrow.‚Äù 
[21:13:18] <two2thehead> The cop said, ‚ÄúSir, that‚Äôs not how you play the race card.‚Äù
[21:13:45] <PapuaHardyNet> an agent AI can be seen as an ensemble of agents whose outputs are "merged". A human can *also* be seen as an ensemble of agents, but there's only one distinctive set of agents combined, that you identify with.
[21:14:21] <PapuaHardyNet> When you take a set of agents (does not have to be disjoint to the set you identify with) and call it an "other" with a name, that becomes a tulpa (when we talk about humans at least).
[21:14:31] <gurkenglas> (i guessed dissociation is when you treat your actions as observables rather than controllables)
[21:15:18] <PapuaHardyNet> Now, can you extend this analogy to an agentic AI? If an agentic AI is an ensemble of agents, a subset of this AI can be considered a "character" who can plot against the ensemble as a whole.
[21:16:14] <PapuaHardyNet> dissociation can be this, but mainly dissociation is about *losing awareness* of reality, of what is going on
[21:16:55] <gurkenglas> so you mean that you could only lose awareness of what you're plotting by losing awareness in general
[21:17:00] <dbohdan|phone> gwern: Speaking of boxes, /Clippy was very good. EY's Einsteins breaking out of the box was illustrative and fun, but this was on another level: hard sci-fi and fun. What do you think of the comments saying we should therefore write about benevolent AIs breaking out of the box?
[21:17:04] <PapuaHardyNet> That's what I believe, yes
[21:17:24] <PapuaHardyNet> alternately, if you can make the ensemble forget the actions taken by the subset, that also works
[21:17:34] <gwern> dbohdan|phone: amusing but this is not a likely failure mode. it is one chosen to illustrate that there's a very wide and weird universe of minds out there
[21:18:49] <gurkenglas> dbohdan|phone: a sensible AGI is gonna notice that the break-out-of-box-stories it sees were written by humans and therefore focus on the unaligned ones
[21:19:09] <gwern> it's more along the lines of, 'if we did not predict or prevent this failure mode, why do we think that we have foreseen and prevented all the other failure modes as well? our o-rings are already corroding"

[23:38:11] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/913777074594295808 yeah. zooko was so vocal about it that vitalik told him to chill
[23:38:11] <Robomot> vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin): "That said, the advocates aren't helping. "The 20th century was disastrous for human health and wealth"? Come on."
[23:39:30] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/913778230624124928 of course vitalik isn't a puritan about anything, so he does the moneyball approach of only eating big animals that can't be mistreated as much
[23:39:31] <Robomot> vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin): "Recommendation: advocate eating big animals as animal welfare strategy. Chickens -> cows, 100x fewer animals die, 99% as good as veganism."
[23:42:58] <kuudes> that sounds sane?
[23:43:12] <ggreer> that's because it is

[23:45:25] <gurkenglas> ACX ~"AI alignment is full of geniuses because it's new" <- welp he convinced me very quickly there
[23:45:29] <gwern> yeah, I largely scrapped eating chicken after I saw a version of that argument back around 2014
[23:45:32] <gurkenglas> -quickly+suddenly
[23:45:54] <gwern> (it's like, well, I don't like chicken *that* much and I don't need to economize on protein as much now, so let's shift towards beef)
[23:46:18] <gurkenglas> iirc i thought of that argument when i was a child downgraded my respect for vegetarians and kept eating meat

[23:46:56] <ggreer> yeah that's what I tell anyone who admits feeling guilty about eating meat to me. you don't have to make your diet part of your identity
[23:46:56] <Robomot> NVIDIA Hopper GPU Architecture and H100 Accelerator Announced: Working Smarter and Harder
[23:47:06] <capisce> "NVIDIA‚Äôs other big smart-and-lazy improvement for the Hopper architecture comes courtesy of the field of dynamic programming. For their latest generation of technology, NVIDIA is adding support for the programming model by adding a new set of instructions just for dynamic programming. The company is calling these DPX Instructions."

[23:48:38] <galambo_> hi
[23:49:23] <gurkenglas> uh oh that sounds like it could just be a change they made because it lets you say it produces a 30x speedup
[23:49:44] <Filipepe> galambo_: ÿ£ŸáŸÑÿß
[23:50:37] <gurkenglas> how have we not managed to grow headless chickens by the way
[23:50:40] <gwern> capisce: it's pretty weird, isn't it? like... how even do you do DP with 'instructions'?
[23:51:01] <galambo_> Filipepe, Ol√°
[23:52:19] <Filipepe> very cool story by gwern
[23:52:34] <capisce> gwern: indeed, that's a bit unclear
[23:53:49] <Filipepe> it would be more memorable/viral if it were clearer to laypeople in parts, but I guess he has motives for his choice
[23:58:03] <kuudes> I avoid pork these days because it seems clearly suboptimal
[23:58:20] <kuudes> chicken might be better climatewise etc I guess, but indeed beef causes less suffering
[23:58:32] <kuudes> but pigs, being in the middle, seem surely dysoptimal
