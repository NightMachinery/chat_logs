[00:51:09] <LuxuryMode> I have the following migration which adds a field, first as nullable, then sets the value of that column for existing rows then alters the field to be not null. https://dpaste.org/WF5E It is failing on the AlterField operation with `django.db.utils.IntegrityError: column "original_rent_amount" contains null values` It fails even if I add in a check to make sure that `renewal.lease.unit.current_rent_amount` is not null. Any ideas?
[00:51:29] <dodo> LuxuryMode: if you write normal python code you will use the normal models
[00:52:01] <dodo> LuxuryMode: a migration should never modify tables and then add data, make two migrations
[00:52:13] <dodo> LuxuryMode: also read https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/migrations/#data-migrations
[00:52:36] <LuxuryMode> one to add the nullable column then another to add data and then (another) to make it not null?
[00:54:44] <LuxuryMode> > they’re best written as separate migrations, sitting alongside your schema migrations.
[00:55:02] <dodo> exactly
[00:55:16] <LuxuryMode> I hear your point, but I think you're overstating it. "Best written" != "a migration should never modify..."
[00:56:19] <LuxuryMode> Anyways, thanks. I'll give it a shot, but I'm doubtful it'll resolve my issue.

[15:44:32] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Hi guys. What do you do in these situations: https://dpaste.org/qzU1
[15:45:28] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Basically, I have some raw SQL executing somewhere in the code, and after it a filter should happen (get_queryset and filter_queryset in DRF)
[15:48:35] <dodo> Safa_[A_Boy]: i doubt that's possible.. injecting raw sql means the ORM can't know what you've done
[15:49:58] <Safa_[A_Boy]> That's what I'm asking. How do you handle such a situation?
[15:50:54] <dodo> never tried this. a quick search leads me to https://github.com/zxibizz/django-raw-sugar
[15:53:31] *** Joins: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei)
[15:54:10] <theorangeone> Looking at that query, does it have to be raw SQL? Looks simple enough to just do in the ORM, bypass this whole issue
[15:56:57] <Safa_[A_Boy]> dodo, Will check it!
[15:57:47] <Safa_[A_Boy]> theorangeone, How though? I'm using a group by, and AFAIK, the result will not be model instances, but dictionaries
[15:58:23] *** Quits: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[15:59:34] <theorangeone> If it's not model instances, then there's no way the ORM is going to be able to deal with it. You'll probably be best either changing the query so it keeps functioning like it's model instances, or use 100% SQL. I'd strongly recommend the former
[16:07:17] *** Joins: iomari891 (~iomari891@105.112.138.38)
[16:07:25] <Safa_[A_Boy]> theorangeone, No, I mean that group by in Django have to be before an annotation, and once you do that, the result will be a dictionary rather than a model instance. At least this is my observation
[16:08:38] <theorangeone> Annotate definitely doesn't work like that, as you can query on annotated fields. `aggregate` on the other hand I believe does do that
[16:08:58] <GinFuyou> .values() do
[16:09:44] *** Joins: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei)
[16:11:05] <Safa_[A_Boy]> The thing is that queryset.values(*) doesn't groupby, queryset.values(*).annotate(*) groups and returns dictionaries, that's what I meant
[16:11:56] <theorangeone> `annotate` definitely doesn't group. Grouping is usually done with `.values` and `.order_by`. `annotate` just allows you to stick some extra fields on. Can always annotate and filter before you call `.values`
[16:13:37] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Bad choice of words. .values() before any other operation groups, and returns dictionaries
[16:13:50] <theorangeone> so do that call last
