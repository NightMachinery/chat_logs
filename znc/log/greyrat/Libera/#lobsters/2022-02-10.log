[00:13:09] <JordiGH> Hm, weird, Macs don't have USB-A port anymore does it?
[00:13:26] <JordiGH> The mouse they sent me is a USB A mouse.
[00:13:39] <JordiGH> And it has a SUPER scrolly wheel.
[00:13:43] <JordiGH> Like, the wheel has inertia.
[00:13:51] <JordiGH> Makes it really hard to middle click without scrolling.
[00:14:05] <wink> one of the switchableones maybe?
[00:14:26] <wink> have you tried fiddling with the wheel? I had a mouse once where I only accidentally switched between normal and manic mode

[00:16:20] <JordiGH> wink: I can't figure out how. If I slightly graze the wheel it starts scrolling all over the place.
[00:17:04] <wink> 10x developers need 10x scroll speed
[00:17:40] *** Joins: tcole (~tcole@user/tcole)
[00:17:57] <JordiGH> Oh the wheel isn't a middle click button at all.
[00:18:02] <JordiGH> That's a dedicated button.
[00:18:09] <iDrougge> Did they just pick a mouse out of a recycling box?
[00:18:49] <JordiGH> It came packaged as a new mouse.
[00:19:05] <JordiGH> wink: Yeah, so clicking the wheel changes to 10x dev mode.

[00:20:34] <JordiGH> I hope they also send lots of dongles.
[00:20:46] <JordiGH> It's weird I'm getting the hardware on a trickle.
[00:20:58] <JordiGH> Maybe next I'll a keyboard stand or something.
[00:21:38] <defect> no, only usb-c as far as i know
[00:22:15] <JordiGH> Oh, it also does Bluetooth. That explains it.
[00:24:16] <iDrougge> Can you dismantle the cord?
[00:26:20] <iDrougge> The first question asked should be "What dongle would you like?".

[01:07:43] <feoh> Is it me or should any talk from Dylan Beattie be seen as pretty much performance art? "There's No Such Thing As Plaintext" makes for good buzzfeed style clickbait and some of the content is INDEED interesting but I also seriously disagree with his base assertion, since I think we can all agree that "plaintext" is a body of unadorned unicode

[12:02:41] <scubagear[m]> For those working in an env with devs on Windows and Linux, what's your approach to make sure everything in git has LF line endings instead of CRLF?

[12:04:58] <legit> I edit everything with vscode, so it kinda handles it automatically

[12:44:15] <gerikson> for example, if you view https://gerikson.com/blog/photo, you'll get pics from years, so the time the page(view) is generated isn't really interesting
[12:44:25] <gerikson> it would be the same time as the last entry
[12:46:03] <bkhl> scubagear[m], if you have people working in Windows and want to enforce one kind of line ending, I think you need to add lints for it or it will fail.
[12:46:29] <bkhl> Lints in CI I mean.
[12:46:50] <grgz> you could use <meta name="date" content="1994-11-06T08:49:37+00:00">

[12:52:52] <gerikson> I still think it's better to include this data at the <body> level, either explicitely or via a microformat
[12:53:34] <gerikson> because I bet the majority of web pages are "generated" from a db or the filesystem, and the creation date is attached to that part, not the page itself
[12:54:06] <scubagear[m]> bkhl: also looking at .gitattributes now, seems like it could work. `* text=auto`
[12:54:50] <bkhl> scubagear[m], yes, I guess, but then _not_ setting it to auto is probably clearer.
[12:55:04] <bkhl> And just enforce everyone set their editor to the desired format
[12:55:22] <bkhl> The auto conversion stuff is just confusing, and pretty much every editor can handle Unix line endings if you configure it.

[15:04:55] <lep> good. gnu should only care about freedom
[15:12:02] <gerikson> the freedom to sit immobile without being able to act on the world ;)
[15:14:53] <grgz> isn't this related to the age-old question about chained freedom? If a community is fully free and all members choose to be bound, is it then truly free? I see both point of views. I don't want to put words into anyone's mouth, but I guess GNU would respond with: we chain you to free stuff so you don't go running off to the next enslaver. Sort-of related to that other age-old question: should a
[15:14:55] <grgz> tolerant society tolerate intolerance
[15:15:18] <gerikson> yeah that's my take too
[15:15:50] <gerikson> I think the problem is that GNU was confronted with binary blobs and chose a solution consistent with their views (or RMS') and everyone else is like 'wut'
[15:16:19] <gerikson> I mean long before you get to blobs you run into permissive licensing vs GNU
[15:16:35] <gerikson> and depending on your point of view, those are indeed more "free"
[15:19:27] <grgz> I'm surprised people are still surprised when they see FSF and GNU shun binary blobs and do their own thing. I'm a fan of Xe's blog but I don't see how this blogpost is more than recycled anti-GNU critiques

[17:12:24] <rb> there are a wide spectrum of GNU+Linux distros available. some people choose the ones which disallow any sort of non-free blobs. that's their choice though
[17:12:45] <rb> you don't get burned at the stake for running a non-libre kernel on trisquel
[17:13:04] <rb> just, don't expect support, because that wasn't The Way It's IntendedTM
[17:13:27] <rb> and if you feel like there's a niche between mainstream distros and full-libre distros, why not fill it yourself? :^)

[19:04:52] <companion_cube> now I'm confused
[19:05:03] <companion_cube> I need to check which one OCaml supports :D
[19:05:25] <hl> companion_cube: tldr; don't worry about it, the old POWER ISA is hardly ever referred to nowadays so just assume anyone talking about POWER is talking about PowerPC (officially, now called the Power Architecture)
[19:05:29] <leonardo> too much POWERs, if i may say so :)
[19:05:53] <hl> leonardo: as if to troll us, we've had POWER8 and POWER9... except someone in marketing at IBM decided that POWER10 should be written 'Power10'. yes really.
[19:05:55] <companion_cube> ok so it is PowerPC. thx
[19:06:14] <leonardo> what a headache
[19:06:27] <hl> pretty much
[19:06:36] <companion_cube> HEADACHE9
[19:06:42] <hl> to disambiguate things you also have the choice of just referring to it as in a triple, i.e. ppc64. everyone knows what you mean then

[19:55:10] <iDrougge> kline: But it seems that Risc V is not just new, but ill-designed.
[19:55:45] <kline> in terms of the ISA or the implementation?
[19:56:00] <iDrougge> hl: POWER architecture is younger than x86, and likely ARM as well.
[19:56:11] <kline> its a free ISA, implementations will differ so some implementations may have instructions that are slower or faster
[19:56:51] <kline> i would say that as long as the ISA doesnt turn out to be unusably awkward then theres hope that implementations will continue to improve over time
[20:02:26] <iDrougge> kline: It seems the ISA itself is suboptimal.

[20:06:21] <rb> kline: the problem with that argument is that then there's a possibility that we will have multiple diverging extensions, and nothing will have been solved wrt openness
[20:06:21] <gwozniak> I've asked a couple hardware people about risc-v and they haven't been terribly enthusiastic, mainly saying the addressing stuff is inadequate
