[18:18:15] <FromGitter> <Synow> Hey , having some issue lunching spacemacs within WSL2. Must say that im trying solving this for 3 days now, tried everything. Simple and yet annoying - Im lunching into emacs with gui no problem, but spacemacs just refuses to be resent. I have the .emacs.d cloned (tried both master first and then dev) I have it in my WSL2 $HOME (also done 'getenv' from within the emacs when loaded and it points to my true WSL home 
[18:18:15] <FromGitter> ... path where the .emacs.d is) . Does any one have any idea why this could happen? (Tried reinstalling everything and starting from scrach a few times, tried emacs 26 and 27, yet im getting just vannila every single time)  ‚èé TY!
[18:28:50] <FromGitter> <alex-ilin> I thought the WSL GUI support was currently in early beta for insider builds of Windows, etc. See this post from December 29th last year (less than 3 week old): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps
[18:30:46] <FromGitter> <alex-ilin> This is actually the reason I'm thinking about running Spacemacs in Qemu, since there could be legal issues with installing VirtualBox on a work PC.
[18:34:32] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I got a really good WSL2 experience after following [this guide] (but only after, I accidentally, found the correct firewall setting)
[18:36:01] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I only uses WSL2 only for a day or so, but everything was working perfectly fine using that `VcXsrv`
[18:37:31] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > I only uses WSL2 only for a day or so, but everything was working perfectly fine using that `VcXsrv` ‚èé  ‚èé Because I always work in Fedora... but I tried to convince a flatmate to use Spacemacs on WSL2, and it seemed to work perfectly fine also
[18:37:58] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I did not have to mess with any environment settings
[18:43:16] <FromGitter> <Synow> Thanks for the replies! I have no issue running GUI apps. installed VcXsrv and having emacs up and running along side other GUi apps. The thing is that emacs wont pick up the spacemacs configs form .emacs.d! It just wont no matter what i try!
[18:45:23] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> It's time to give up and just use Linux on metal.
[18:50:22] <FromGitter> <Synow> Tried a few times, could not find a comfortable desktop experience. Maybe i should try again some time.
