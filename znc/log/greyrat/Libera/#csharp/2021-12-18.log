[00:22:16] <JakeSays> anyway, i found ones that are perfect for these leds, but they're always out of stock, so i started buying them whenever they were available. i received some today that i forgot i ordered so i did a count - i have 1,600 of them. lol

[03:25:58] <fredrikhr> Harm133, yeah okay... But that is the issue: Cookie auth defaults to redirect to login page, whereas other more API-centric Auth, like JWT, will default to do the unauthorized http result

[03:26:23] <Harm133> I can change to JWT no problem, I'll try that out, thx!

[03:27:35] <Nasp> Rather useless
[03:27:40] <Harm133> Hmmm, I'll see how I like JWT, if its a hassle I'll just keep going with cookies, seeing as I return a 401 now
[03:28:08] <Nasp> You need to change your entire frontend to make it work with jwt
[03:28:15] <Nasp> Depending on how smart you've made it  can be an issue
[03:28:18] <Nasp> What kind of frontend is it
[03:28:25] <Harm133> None as of now
[03:28:49] <Nasp> Also don't most end up saving the JWT in cookies anyways?
[03:29:02] <JakeSays> wtf is a jwt
[03:29:27] <fredrikhr> Harm133, consider your Configure method: There you'll see a call to app.UseAuthentication() and it's called BEFORE your call to app.UseEndpoints... meaning authentication happens before the actual controller endpoint is invoked. And that is the reason why Cookie-Auth redirects even for an ApiController: It is not smart enough to look ahead to evaluate whether it is doing HTML or API
[03:29:39] <fredrikhr> JakeSays, JWT <- JSON Web Token
[03:29:58] <JakeSays> yet another token
[03:30:02] <fredrikhr> JakeSays, RFC 7519
[03:30:57] <Slade> JakeSays, signed document that basically says "I'm user 349 of Jakestrippers.com"  and since you saved it you can believe it without checking a db or something
[03:31:17] <JakeSays> i've been writing some c# in vs the past couple of days. i've decided that overall rider is better
[03:31:33] <Slade> tho in practice you still check a DB in most scenarios
[03:31:40] <JakeSays> Slade: ah ok
[03:31:53] <JakeSays> unfortunately jakestrippers.com is out of strippers
[03:32:02] <Nasp> https://imgur.com/gallery/rVceQrO Who the fuck tips a waiter over 4000 dollars
[03:32:08] <fredrikhr> yeah and its (usually) cryptographically signed, so the idea is that you can trust the content of the JWT without having to re-validate or store session info in your server
[03:32:32] <fredrikhr> makes it easy to decouple authentication from application (in theory)
[03:32:35] <Nasp> JakeSays:  I thin k it mighe be faster
[03:32:35] <jonp> Nasp: someone who has a $22k bill
[03:32:42] <jonp> 4k is ~20% of that.
[03:32:46] <Nasp> But it's just so hard to get used to a new IDE
[03:32:49] <jonp> now, who has a $22k bill?  wow.
[03:32:57] <Nasp> I find Riders keybinds annoying
[03:32:59] <Harm133> fredrikhr: That results in this: "warning ASP0001: The call to UseAuthorization should appear between app.UseRouting() and app.UseEndpoints(..) for authorization to be correctly evaluated [..csproj]"
[03:33:04] <Nasp> You have bills for 22k?
[03:33:08] <JakeSays> jonp: oh i've heard about a lot of bills larger than that
[03:33:19] <Nasp> ahh
[03:33:19] <fredrikhr> Harm133, I did not say you should move it!
[03:33:19] <jonp> JakeSays: still very impressive
[03:33:24] <Nasp> As in if the ate for 22k
[03:33:26] <JakeSays> Nasp: i change them to fit my wants
[03:33:38] <JakeSays> jonp: oh yes. definitely way above my pay grade
[03:33:41] <fredrikhr> Harm133, I explained why the issue happened
[03:33:49] <Nasp> If you ate for 22k should you really need to tip
[03:33:50] <Harm133> ah, I see :)
[03:33:55] <fredrikhr> and the reasoning behind it
[03:34:21] <jonp> Nasp: YES
[03:34:33] <JakeSays> Nasp: why wouldn't you?
[03:34:35] <jonp> unless the restaurant bakes tips into the price, and doesn't otherwise have them
[03:34:36] <Nasp> tippings the worst
[03:34:39] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Why would i ever tip
[03:34:43] <jonp> Nasp: agreed, but it's what we have.
[03:34:51] <Harm133> fredrikhr: thx :D

[03:35:05] <Nasp> Nobody odes it here
[03:35:08] <Nasp> It's not normal to tip

[03:35:46] <Nasp> United states have the worst tipping culture i've experienced

[03:36:02] <Harm133> staff*
[03:36:02] <JakeSays> i don't see hat the problem is with tipping.
[03:36:11] <jonp> > Diner Grant Wise said the people in his party chipped in $100 each to support the two waitresses.
[03:36:20] <jonp> so 44 people were involved
[03:36:21] <Slade> JakeSays, tipping in japan would be seen with the same awkwardness if you decided to tip your nurse at the doctor
[03:36:23] <jonp> that's a hell of a large party
[03:36:24] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Why not pay people a decent salary instead
[03:36:30] <Nasp> Also you usually can't get a bill in tips
[03:36:32] <jonp> Nasp: because capitalism?
[03:36:43] <jonp> "get a bill in tips"?
[03:36:48] <Nasp> Seems like begging
[03:36:50] <fredrikhr> Harm133, they are. In countries worthy of living in
[03:36:50] <jonp> i don't know what that means.
[03:36:55] <JakeSays> Nasp: nothing i can do about salaries
[03:36:58] <Nasp> In case you need to deduct it
[03:37:08] <Harm133> fredrikhr: :)
[03:37:42] <Harm133> Tipping in my country is seen as a compliment towards the staff, never required
[03:37:58] <JakeSays> Harm133: it's not required here either
[03:38:01] <jonp> Harm133: that's what it's "supposed" to be here
[03:38:06] <Nasp> JakeSays:  It is isn't it
[03:38:07] <Slade> also, i once tipped like $10 to someone at mcdonalds who was awesome.. everytime afterwards, i found my bag stuffed with apple pies
[03:38:09] <Nasp> Else people will spit in your food
[03:38:11] <jonp> until you look at what they're actually paid, which is like 1/4 of minimum wage
[03:38:15] <Nasp> Or call you a shithead like you did before
[03:38:16] <JakeSays> Nasp: it's not required
[03:38:20] <jonp> and then it's much "less" of a "complement"

[03:39:19] <Slade> jonp, its the american way to solve the problem by building a complex system, instead of removing the rule exception that allows the $2.30 minimum wage for service workers

[03:45:44] <Nasp> Cheaper house :D

[03:47:51] <jonp> nice
[03:48:24] <Nasp> That's like nothing
[03:48:33] <Nasp> You can't even get a 2 bedroom apartment for that

[03:49:20] <JakeSays> it's not
[03:49:27] <Nasp> I find these kind of growth patterns unsustainable
[03:49:31] <Slade> jonp, the real solution is spreading the population out more.. but thats hard in practice
[03:49:32] <JakeSays> well, it's not kansas
[03:50:17] <Nasp> Slade: Almost most jobs seems to centralize around big cities

[03:51:47] <Nasp> I have a collegue who uses over 3 hours today a day on transport
[03:52:02] <Slade> anyhow, economics moving into the industrial/citiese were based on single income households.. we still havent adopted to an economic model that supports the diversity we have today.. its a cause of a lot of our issues
[03:52:06] <Nasp> He's kidna gotten used to working from home and rarely shows up at the office now
[03:52:32] <Nasp> In a way i want a housing / market collapse
[03:52:39] <Nasp> Especially if i can get to sell my apartment before it happens
[03:52:48] <JakeSays> Slade: well, the diversity came about because a single income wasn't enough
[03:53:16] <Slade> JakeSays, no. the diversity came first, and created single income not enough
[03:53:41] <JakeSays> i don't believe that's the case

[04:00:00] <Slade> JakeSays, ww2, women became workers creating dual income households to a minor extent, and remained as such when the men returned, having a double income turned into a competitive advantage.
[04:00:19] <Nasp> What, now you can't travel in trains without corona passport
[04:00:24] <Nasp> Good thing i just got a car
[04:00:57] <Slade> JakeSays, then equal rights, with minorities being able to compete for the same jobs (and houses) caused additional constraint on fixed resources
[04:01:37] <Slade> jonp's solution is sorta to give everyone less (more housing in same fixed space) but its only a temporary solution.. needs to be something more thought out
[04:02:28] <Nasp> Give everyone a Tokyo pod room?
[04:02:44] <Slade> thats the extreme version of the jonp solution
[04:03:43] <JakeSays> give everyone less?
[04:03:46] <Slade> at the end of the day, we establishu a 2 income household should have twice the buying power as a single income household, with more shared expenses, as also establish that 2 income and 1 income households should compete
[04:03:55] <Slade> JakeSays, smaller houses, stacked houses etc
[04:04:36] <Nasp> Build better transport infrastructure and make people move away from the cities
[04:04:54] <JakeSays> Slade: what exactly does "give" mean in this context
[04:05:37] <Slade> JakeSays, not free, but make it so people have the opportunity to pay for
[04:06:15] <Slade> coincidentally, this is why my chinese students, that are content to live 6-12 people in a household, have such extreme buying power
[04:06:22] <Nasp> I still dont understand how i got through my studies with so low income
[04:06:30] <Nasp> And when i look at prices now i dont get how newer generatiosn can do it
[04:07:23] <JakeSays> Slade: so govt subsidized housing
[04:07:50] <Slade> JakeSays, no, government required minimum number of housing units per acre
[04:08:09] <JakeSays> Slade: that won't control pricing
[04:08:36] <Slade> JakeSays, increases supply, many people think it'll help.. i think it'll help temporarily, but i dont think its the correct solution (as i've stated)
[04:08:51] <Nasp> Here we have some stupid rules that require you to build apartments of a minimum average size
[04:09:00] <Nasp> Which is quite high, making the prices rather insane
[04:09:00] <Slade> this was what i suggested -->  <Slade> ... the real solution is spreading the population out more.. but thats hard in practice
[04:09:08] <bomb> we should decrease world population to 500 mil
[04:09:29] <JakeSays> Slade: if there was money in hyper dense housing we'd already have it
[04:09:31] <Nasp> bomb:  Yes lets start WW3
[04:09:41] <Slade> JakeSays, there is no money in it. thats the point
[04:09:57] <JakeSays> so even mandating it won't make it happen
[04:09:59] <Slade> its better for builders to make 3000+ square feet houses for 2 people and charge more
[04:10:14] <Slade> anyhow, korean bbq time. :)

[20:32:52] <brianonymous> should still be illegal
[20:32:58] <JakeSays> ^^
[20:33:04] <brianonymous> white chocolate is gross

[20:36:40] <Slade> Nasp, play on words of various forms. kinda like what they do with vegan cheese these days..  basically it didnt have cocoa so it couldnt use the word chocolate
[20:36:53] <Nasp> Ahh
[20:37:01] <Nasp> Yeah some of those newer vegan products are a bit confusing
[20:37:09] <Slade> 'cheddar blocks'
[20:37:13] <Nasp> And each time they try they get told they arent allowed to call something that isn't chicken chicken
[20:38:09] <Nasp> One brand came up with "cluck-free"
[20:38:59] <Slade> but yea, brianonymous and JakeSays hate comes from the fact there was no regulation. so white chocolate was commonly a big block of solidified cornsyrup and sugar
[20:39:24] <Slade> these days they have to have at least some milk, and have a maximum amount of sugars
[20:40:12] <JakeSays> Slade: no, the hate comes from the fact that it's not chocolate.
[20:40:16] <Nasp> I wish all vegan products came with a big warning label
[20:40:27] <Slade> JakeSays, neither is steak, but you dont hate steak
[20:40:36] <Nasp> Also according to statistics made by our canteen, 20% are either vegetarian or vegan
[20:40:42] <Nasp> Doesn't that seem excessively high?
[20:40:50] <JakeSays> Slade: i would hate "white steak" if it were in fact not steak
[20:41:10] <Slade> JakeSays, hum. i'd assume white steak was pork, or some sort of fish

[20:43:24] <Nasp> Although it is in the big city
[20:43:35] <Nasp> Old canteen had vegetarian days
[20:43:36] <Slade> heh i was just thinking. can you imagine this lifestyle back in jesus days?   dude goes out and feeds 5000 people with bread and fish..  today everyone would be  "I'm a vegetarian" or "is that bread gluten free"
[20:43:42] <Nasp> It was the worst, even the vegetarians hated it
[20:44:01] <Nasp> Is that organic wine?

[23:06:08] <MatthiasVance> Daycare will stay open
[23:06:12] <MatthiasVance> 🎉
[23:06:43] <lz_> did chrome fucking remove "search google image" right click button on pictures? wtf?
[23:07:00] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: On fire? Again? Heh?
[23:07:04] <lz_> instead I have some useless "search image with google lens"
[23:07:18] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Well i dont know if it has stopped?
[23:07:23] <MatthiasVance> Heh?
[23:07:24] <lz_> wtf
[23:08:04] <MatthiasVance> I believe there was a riot in some place
[23:08:16] <MatthiasVance> Vaccination-unenthousiasts
[23:08:31] <MatthiasVance> But really just people who wanted to destroy things I think
[23:08:43] <Nasp> Yeah it usually is
[23:08:57] <Nasp> We have the same here where it's the same group of people no matter the cause who shows up and set things on fire
[23:09:05] <lz_> am I the only one
[23:09:06] <Nasp> It's a shame because usually it ruins the real demo someone arranged
[23:09:24] <MatthiasVance> Yeah, you can disagree all you want but don't destroy other people's stuff
[23:09:37] <MatthiasVance> What you saw in US when they looted the shops
[23:09:42] <MatthiasVance> Poor shop owners
[23:09:59] <Nasp> Yeah
[23:10:15] <Nasp> We had the same 10 years ago because a certain youth house was closed
[23:10:20] <Nasp> WAs riots for months
[23:10:47] <lz_> "google lens" is sth that brings you... shop results for a picture
[23:10:55] <lz_> why would I want shop results seriously
[23:11:20] <lz_> I wonder if I installed some extension that messed it up or if it's actually a chrome update
[23:14:00] <lz_> loool so I fired up a vm, tried to install chrome from edge: https://i.imgur.com/IZ884Wn.png
[23:14:20] <Nasp> haha
[23:14:31] <Nasp> Even when you change it you get another notification
[23:14:36] <Nasp> "Serious edge is better, go use it"
[23:14:49] <Nasp> Never quite understood the browser war
[23:15:42] <MatthiasVance> MONEY
[23:15:44] <MatthiasVance> lots of MONEY
[23:15:58] <MatthiasVance> Users = data = money
[23:16:02] <lz_> is that why chrome replaced image search with fucking google lens
[23:16:10] <MatthiasVance> idk I use Edge
[23:16:22] <MatthiasVance> Ever since they switched to Chromium
[23:16:59] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  YEah but still
[23:17:08] <lz_> yup it's gone in the vm too, lol https://i.imgur.com/nEp7YoC.png

[23:18:04] <lz_> what I don't understand is that I can't find anything on the web that talks about it

[23:20:09] <xb0o2> Which particular bit of Google's bullshit?
[23:20:38] <MatthiasVance> Optimizing for moneyyyy
[23:20:39] <lz_> if I set the search engine to bing I get "search with bing image" but if I go back to google I get the "google lens" shit back
[23:20:56] <lz_> xb0o2: "search image on the web" right click button is gone in chrome
[23:21:13] <lz_> instead they pushed fucking shop links
[23:21:31] <Nasp> Bing is still a joke
[23:22:14] <Nasp> Hmm fireworks or someone getting popped
[23:22:42] <xb0o2> Or fireworks getting popped
[23:22:48] <xb0o2> Or someone getting fireworked
[23:23:31] <lz_> I could remove the google lens shit by disabling it in the flags but my experience is, sooner or later they'll remove the flag
[23:24:12] <lz_> thanks google for wasting 10mins of my life
[23:24:18] <xb0o2> Well, Mozilla play by the same rulebook :)
[23:24:58] <lz_> why am I the only one on the internet who noticed this
[23:25:11] <xb0o2> A/B test with a sample size of 1?
[23:25:30] <lz_> lol maybe, and then it'd be A/B test by ip because I have the same in a vm
[23:25:44] <Nasp> lz_: Atleast they still have an option for showiing the full url
[23:25:56] <Nasp> I really hate that feature where it only shows the domain name
[23:26:11] <xb0o2> Agreed, that's horrendous

[23:27:21] <sysRPL> wow, microsoft impressed me
[23:27:37] <Nasp> Sooo public transport now requires corona passport

[23:28:01] <Nasp> Am i stupid or are the people who make these rules stupid?
[23:28:18] <sysRPL> i hadn't used net core (.net 5 or 6) with iis before, and it turned out to be the smoothest thing ever
[23:28:33] <Nasp> IIS is the devil
[23:29:25] <sysRPL> well, sometimes you need a webserver
[23:29:35] <Nasp> Kestrel!
[23:29:42] <xb0o2> I *hate* IIS
[23:29:56] <sysRPL> what about multiple domains?
[23:30:03] <sysRPL> and multiple sites?
[23:30:17] <Nasp> If you are making something new i really dont understand why you opt to go for IIS
[23:30:22] *** Joins: MaNa2k (~MaNa2k@213.236.160.63)
[23:30:50] <sysRPL> how can you host multiple domains and multiple apps using just kestrel?
[23:31:15] <sysRPL> assuming you want to use the standard ports 80 / 443
[23:31:25] <Nasp> Multiple domains are easy
[23:31:28] <Nasp> No idea about multiple sites
[23:31:41] <sysRPL> yeah well there you fo
[23:31:44] <xb0o2> Use any other web server that isn't the pig IIS is
[23:31:45] <sysRPL> * go
[23:31:46] <Nasp> But i would assume you have a loadbalancer where you can just map it
[23:32:23] <Nasp> And here i am have been using the last 4 months working against getting rid of IIS
[23:33:12] <sysRPL> i beleive when hosting net core on iis, it jsut goes straight through
[23:33:20] <sysRPL> if configured correctly
[23:33:51] <sysRPL> but iis willl look at the domain in the request and sent it to the appropriate application

[23:34:28] <xb0o2> Yes but that's not a unique feature to IIS.
[23:34:59] <sysRPL> i've had lots of problems setting up apache
[23:35:04] <sysRPL> and no problems with iis
[23:35:06] <xb0o2> IIS is super Microsoft Enterprisey and that's why I don't get on with it
[23:35:32] <Nasp> We do local development wiht IIS
[23:35:35] <Nasp> Hurts soo much
[23:35:37] <sysRPL> well i am have been using windows server core 2012
[23:35:47] <xb0o2> Too many bells and whistles, too much default configuration, too painful to actually get it to get out of the way and let you do what you want
[23:35:52] <sysRPL> and for local dev i use kestrel
[23:36:20] <sysRPL> plus vs code on linux
[23:36:44] <Nasp> I assume it's a hobby project?
[23:36:49] <sysRPL> no razor, no blazor, no mvc, no ef
[23:37:03] <Nasp> didn't you just say kestrel?
[23:37:18] <sysRPL> yeah and?

[23:37:32] <Nasp> So you use kestrel connections natively?
[23:37:40] <Nasp> Then what do you have in your application
[23:38:04] <sysRPL> i mean i develop and test in vs code with the F5 key and don't need iis during development and testing
[23:38:14] <Nasp> But no MVC or EF?
[23:38:34] <sysRPL> but then went i publish i put stuff on my windows 2012 server  core and use iis
[23:38:42] <sysRPL> no mvc no ef
[23:38:50] <sysRPL> i have my own framework

[23:41:42] <sysRPL> my preferred method for html generation is now to use javascript with template literals and aync class to my server that return json
[23:42:31] <sysRPL> and the json is converted to objects that then populate the template literals which are inserted into the page
[23:43:29] <sysRPL> in this way i just write out the page in html, and it get filled out from data returned by the server
[23:43:50] <sysRPL> imo it's the most straight forward way to render dynamic content
[23:44:18] <sysRPL> no mvc, no razor, no ef
