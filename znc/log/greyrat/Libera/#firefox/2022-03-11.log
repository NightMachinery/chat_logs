[09:45:25] <Cork> it's used to encrypt the password store, sync isn't related
[09:47:12] <Cork> if you want to protect the full profile you want full disk encryption

That being said, Sync data is already E2E encrypted in-transit (much better than Chrome) but once the data is on your computer it is not encrypted. Generally speaking if someone has access to your computer you are already compromised

[11:50:33] <Mo> Cork: I already have full disk encryption.  With "password store" you mean the local data? How would I encrypt the sync data? Can I have my own sync server, maybe on simple WebDAV?
[11:51:35] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: Securing my computer I already do. But how would I secure the sync data, if I would not trust the sync server?
[11:54:28] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: yes you can have your own sync server. You don't have to trust the sync server though, the data is only encrypted and decrypted on the client. If Mozilla were hacked or the government demanded the data Mozilla could not decrypt it for them. This is why if you reset your password you lose your data.
[11:54:49] <Caspy7[m]> That's why I said it's superior to Chrome's sync
[11:56:32] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: Interesting. So my primary password is the key for that remote encryption?
[11:56:48] <Caspy7[m]> yes
[11:57:49] <Mo> I know that it would be recommended to have strong passwords on websites, I'm going to improve that here by replacing all the weak passwords if the password manager is working for me. I'm just not sure if I'm going to base all on the Firefox synced passwords OR if I'm going for something like KeePass.
[11:57:54] <Caspy7[m]> or, I forget if it's consider a "part" of the key or whatever, you can ask someone on Mozilla's matrix chat if you'd like to get further into the weeds, but Mozilla cannot decrypt it because of how it's designed with your PW being key to decryption
[11:58:16] <Caspy7[m]> I use bitwarden
[11:58:26] <Caspy7[m]> but Firefox's sync is good too
[11:58:58] <Caspy7[m]> I forget completely why I switched to it, at least at the time FxSync didn't have all the features I wanted, they may have caught up by now
[11:59:07] <Caspy7[m]> they've been building it up over time

[11:59:57] <Mo> As for the strong passBitwarden, again something new. It's commercial? I would prefer something open, free, multi-platform. You would prefer Bitwarden over KeePass?
[12:00:41] <Mo> For the password manager I also like to store custom snippets, Gnome stuff from gnome key server... 
[12:02:06] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: Whenever this had come up in the past and people were assessing PW managers, ppl who value OSS, and good, secure design, I seem to recall the verdict was bitwarden which is why I went with it
[12:02:08] <Caspy7[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwarden
[12:02:15] <Mo> Anyway, I start with the Firefox sync first, if you say it's encrypted anyway. The password for that should be strong as well, because it's the central point... 
[12:02:20] <Caspy7[m]> yes it's FOSS
[12:02:42] <Caspy7[m]> I installed a PW generator, but they may have created their own by now
[12:02:56] <Caspy7[m]> (I of course later found that bitwarden has one too)
[12:03:42] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: If Bitwarden has a commercial licensing, they have a central server that checks the license? I would depend on that server then?
[12:03:45] <Caspy7[m]> yeah, bitwarden allows for custom type entries, just notes or other stuff I think. I don't know about FxSync, maybe
[12:03:55] <Caspy7[m]> no idea how that all works

[12:53:34] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[12:55:18] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: probably first open your main profile directory, then shut down firefox, move the relevant old matching files (key4.db etc) elsewhere in case you need them as backup, then copy into the profile the new ones

[12:59:43] <Caspy7[m]> correct. I didn't know you had pre-existing password
[13:00:10] <Mo> I mean, Firefox should be able to import passwords from another Firefox, no?
[13:00:24] <Caspy7[m]> I'm on Nightly and there's an option to export to CSV...doesn't seem to helpful as I'm not seeing an option to import from CSV
[13:00:45] <Mo> Cork: Any idea?
[13:01:05] <Caspy7[m]> they probably don't design that because it's not common to merge passwords from multiple profiles
[13:01:44] <Mo> Importing passwords and bookmarks from whatever format is a quite basic requirement.
[13:01:50] <Cork> Mo: firefox moved away from the keyX.db file a long time ago
[13:01:57] <Cork> not sure it has the migration code anymore
[13:02:04] <Cork> you could try importing it in an older firefox
[13:02:09] <Cork> and then let it upgrade

[13:03:31] <Cork> the keyX.db file keeps the generated bofuscation key

[13:04:53] <Caspy7[m]> they're trying to merge the passwords from two profiles
[13:05:00] <Cork> ya, no way around that
[13:05:14] <Cork> you would have to open the old one in a firefox instance and manually copy them over
[13:05:20] <Cork> there are no marge tools
[13:05:26] <Caspy7[m]> hrm...
[13:05:28] <Mo> No addons either?
[13:05:52] <Cork> as extensions can't really access these things anymore, no
[13:06:10] <Caspy7[m]> if I go into workaround mode, I'd try exporting to CVS (which I know is in nightly at least) for both, merge those, then find another browser that will accept a CVS import
[13:06:34] <Caspy7[m]> then from there Firefox has an option to import from another browser
[13:07:15] <Caspy7[m]> if you go to about:logins then the ... on the upper right
[13:07:35] <Caspy7[m]> that is, click the "..." button on the upper right
[13:11:55] <Mo> Another point to go for a real password manager one day soon... I guess those are able to import from different stores. But ok, at least I have my old Palemoon passwords available now.
[13:12:45] <Mo> As for my favourite Tridactyl addon, would that work on Chrome by the way? I remember Addons architecture have been made more universal recently when XUL have been removed, no?

[13:17:11] <Caspy7[m]> fx, ch extensions are not 1:1 compatible, they must be modified somewhat by devs
[13:17:32] <Caspy7[m]> also fx supports more features, so some can't work in Chrome
[13:17:54] <Caspy7[m]> like anything integrating with containers or more powerful content blocking, for instance
[13:18:36] <Caspy7[m]> just search the chrome store for tridactyl if you'd like to know
