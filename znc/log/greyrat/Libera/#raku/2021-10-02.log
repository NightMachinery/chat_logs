[21:05:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Assume that 1) I execute a script multiple times without changing it, and 2) the script starts with a call to `srand` , say  `srand(332)` . Does 2) guarantee that the subsequent calls of random commands in the script (using `roll`, `pick`, or  `rand`) and Hash-objects creation commands would produce the same results during each execution of the script?
[21:06:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I strongly suspect that Hash-objects creation is not influenced by `srand`.
[21:06:26] <lizmat> Indeed, I don't think that's the case either
[21:07:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> (I asked the above question few days ago in <#768511641758466088> … )

[21:09:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat My question above is actually related to profiling `Hash::int` and `Hash::str`.
