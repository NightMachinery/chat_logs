[01:17:31] <Wafficus> well I'm not a windows user
[01:17:44] <Wafficus> but you never know if I want to share the drive with family etc on LAN
[01:17:45] <Wafficus> not sure yet
[01:17:56] <codebam> no problem, I think the fdisk one is 100%FULL or something, parted is just 100%
[01:18:11] <codebam> ah true
[01:18:20] <codebam> I mean, on LAN it wouldn't be seen as NTFS
[01:18:21] <Wafficus> ideally, I should really build one of those small cased NAS's where you can just plop drives into within seconds. Even though its like $400+ for those setups, for me, it might be worth it
[01:18:42] <Wafficus> yeah for my own use right now, I usually just ssh into my file server locally anyway
[01:18:58] <Wafficus> this drive in particular is just a hold-off server since I found a huge treasure trove of art class stuff that I just had to have
[01:18:58] <ananke> so why NTFS?
[01:19:03] <codebam> have you used sshfs before? it's cool if you want to mount a directory
[01:19:09] <Wafficus> for future compatibility for other OS's without the fuss honestly
[01:19:17] <Wafficus> yep, sshfs is awesome
[01:19:21] <Wafficus> use that all the time
[01:19:24] <codebam> we have a good NTFS driver now anyways I guess
[01:19:34] <lordvadr> OT: Anybody able to help me find a doc that says servers are responsible for presenting the TLS intermediate certs and that it's not on the client to already have them?
[01:19:54] <ananke> except until you do have 'other OSes', NTFS is a fairly poor choice right now. you better hope you don't need to fsck it
[01:20:05] <Wafficus> did the cert expire? Is it a self-signed cert? lordvadr
[01:20:16] <Wafficus> I only know surface level of cert stuff, but just trying to help you think
[01:20:40] <codebam> ananke: I thought the new driver supported journaling and everything
[01:20:41] <Wafficus> ananke: thats true, but I do have the related fix command just in case it messes up a slight bit
[01:20:50] *** Joins: r3m (~launch@user/r3m)
[01:20:53] <codebam> probably not as good as ext4, but still
[01:20:56] <ananke> codebam: which one? the fuse one is slow, and the kernel one is antique. the new kernel driver is barely in
[01:21:04] *** Joins: qlixed (~qlixed@181.44.129.13)
[01:21:07] <codebam> yeah I meant the new kernel driver
[01:21:15] <ananke> Wafficus: 'related fix command'? linux doesn't have proper ntfs fsck
[01:21:19] <lordvadr> Wafficus: No, I've got another team that has a server mis-configured and I'm trying to find a doc that says, "it's on you to present the chain, not me"
[01:21:24] <Mathisen> the paragon one
[01:21:27] <Wafficus> there's an ntfs fix command
[01:21:30] <Wafficus> hard to explain
[01:21:34] <ananke> codebam: that was barely accepted last week
[01:21:39] <codebam> oh, okay
[01:21:40] <ayecee> lordvadr: looks like it'll be rfc 5246, which says that the server may omit the root certificate
[01:21:40] <Wafficus> like an ntfs drive sometimes can make itself a bit off
[01:21:48] <ananke> Wafficus: ntfs.fsck won't fix any more complex issues
[01:21:50] <codebam> we'll have to wait a while then I guess
[01:21:52] *** Joins: johnjay (~pi@192.142.100.50)
[01:21:55] <Wafficus> I think because of the sectors, or something. But there's a fix to make it mountable again
[01:22:06] <Wafficus> that's literally the only thing I encountered with NTFS drives so far. Everything else has been just fine
[01:22:13] <ayecee> lordvadr: looking for the exact citation though.
[01:22:19] <Wafficus> I have the related fix command somewhere in my Emacs notes, so its not needed now
[01:22:19] <codebam> the new driver will whenever that gets merged into your distro kernel
[01:22:28] <lordvadr> ayecee: thanks, looking with you.
[01:22:45] <ananke> Wafficus: I don't think you understand. the command you're thinking of doesn't address all NTFS issues.
[01:23:08] <Wafficus> If anything, I"m fine for it for now
[01:23:14] <blackgatonegro> NTFS just doesn't like Linux and is terrible for removable drives.
[01:23:20] <Wafficus> I have a mirrored drive setup so far for my actual file server
[01:23:23] <Wafficus> its been fine so far for me
[01:23:26] <ananke> most people with experience will tell you that there will be situations where that tool will not be sufficient, and will tell you to just use windows
[01:23:29] <blackgatonegro> As long as you remember that is okay.
[01:23:35] <lordvadr> ayecee: Page 47. Found it. Thank you so much!
[01:23:39] <ayecee> :)
[01:23:59] <chives> Why does Windows stay so much more popular than linux just advertising?
[01:24:09] <Wafficus> because they have a stranglehold on schools
[01:24:18] <Wafficus> literally they pay schools off for this
[01:24:18] <blackgatonegro> chives Office, governments and games
[01:24:20] <ayecee> chives: network effect
[01:24:38] <Wafficus> "It just works" :/ :| :\
[01:25:00] <ayecee> same reason facebook remains so popular - people use it because everyone else is using it.
[01:25:17] <blackgatonegro> Offices insist on using it, governments get offered deals to use it and most as in 9 out of 10 games run on Windows if a computer version exists.
[01:25:44] <codebam> windows is more secure than linux in a lot of ways
[01:25:51] <ayecee> come on man
[01:25:53] * codebam runs
[01:26:04] <blackgatonegro>  Games is the main reason I keep using Wine, PlayOnLinux and even a laptop with Windows on it.

[04:40:02] <knotMez> I am using 1.21 GB right now i have Chromium open
[04:40:08] <Klinda> Fedora it's a cool name
[04:40:15] <nb-ben> well, it sounds like you're a basic user then
[04:40:20] <mlu> it's also a very boring Linux distro that "just works"
[04:40:54] <mlu> Fedora has its origins in Red Hat (note: the red hat is a redora)
[04:40:58] <Klinda> what do you mean with certain distro will you learn something?
[04:41:02] <nb-ben> likely don't run any database servers on your machine, or having an IDE index heavy projects, or running any VMs etc
[04:41:10] <mlu> it's a bunch of software: Linux itself is just a kernel
[04:41:26] <mlu> different distros work differently, and Arch happens to be one of those that encourages much more tweaking (by the user) than the usual
[04:41:32] *** Joins: hololeap_ (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[04:41:53] <mlu> Fedora and Ubuntu have lots of distro-specific tweaks to their software repos, but generally, they "just work"
[04:41:59] <Klinda> why is worth tweaking it? I think it's boring fighting with the os
[04:42:10] <mlu> with Arch, you'll find yourself spending 30min here and there fixing your install every other month or so
[04:42:14] <nb-ben> basic user might not have been the right expression, I mean, likely having basic uses, is what I meant
[04:42:14] <knotMez> mlu with Arch if you do not configure it you do not have it
[04:42:24] <mlu> Klinda: I actually find it enraging :)

[04:42:55] <knotMez> Klinda you probably do not want to run Arch
[04:42:59] <mlu> anyways: use Fedora or Ubuntu if you don't care about how it works internally and would prefer to find out when you want to

[04:43:30] <Disconsented> But parallel package downloads <3
[04:43:33] <akoana> my system is using 71 or 83 qbits now, but each time I try to measure it that changes, darn... free -q must be buggy
[04:43:52] <Disconsented> I can almost saturate my gigabit connection downloading packages
[04:44:01] <Klinda> which are the distros which require no 'tweaking' ? also 'graphics' isn't really a concern?
[04:44:06] <johnjay> what's this mkfs.vfat for? it says msdos
[04:44:10] <mlu> Klinda: more in generally, if you haven't done your reseasrch on the distros, ubuntu is just more popular these days
[04:44:14] <johnjay> i assume to make a fat32 file system you use mkfs.fat right?
[04:44:19] <Gustavo6046> nsfw linux

[04:44:51] <mlu> Klinda: or, if your work already uses RHEL or CentOS, Fedora is a nice companion
[04:44:57] <johnjay> Klinda: more and more distros are providing basic and "graphical" versions similar to ubuntu's multiple spins
[04:45:08] <johnjay> knotMez: yes mkfs.vfat is a thing apparently
[04:45:14] <Disconsented> Eh, I do have torrents but I dont let them saturate it
[04:45:18] <mlu> I actually personally run Solus these days, because I truly wanted a minimalist, but opinionated, system
[04:45:19] <knotMez> johnjay mkfs.fat is 12 bit I think
[04:45:28] <Disconsented> Mine all seed for 5x ratio or 1 week for anything public
[04:45:40] <mlu> Disconsented sounds like a saint
[04:45:48] <johnjay> i think mkfs.vfat is in dosfstools under debian

[04:46:35] <johnjay> haha ok
[04:46:40] <mlu> but Kali's fun to have when you just want to mess around and leave no trace
[04:46:48] <nb-ben> I suspect it may be mostly attractive to people who pretend to be hackers
[04:46:51] <johnjay> mlu: is Solus one of these fancy independent distros that makes their own rules?
[04:47:16] <mlu> johnjay: yes
[04:47:18] <nb-ben> or delude themselves of that they are ;p
[04:47:22] <knotMez> I htink vfat is the default with flash drives
[04:47:41] <mlu> johnjay: it uses eopkg as its packaging system -- supposedly based on the Turkish government effort to make a packaging system
[04:47:48] <mlu> johnjay: think of it as like a curated Slackware
[04:48:02] <Klinda> every 'newbie' guides on hacking, in young ages, always advise kali linux, but you become a lamer instead
[04:48:14] <knotMez> I've formatted them with like ext and they work but none of the Linux installers use it
[04:48:37] <mlu> I see kali as a toolkit much like memtest86 and gparted
[04:48:48] <johnjay> mlu: ah i see
[04:48:51] <Klinda> slackware also a nice name, how is it?
[04:49:23] <mlu> Klinda: it's very bare-bones
[04:49:23] <knotMez> Slackware is a bit ah not maintained so much
[04:49:31] <johnjay> but basically yeah just look for linux that has KDE, GNOME, Cinnamon in the name
[04:49:35] <mlu> it's maintained by one guy, was one of the original Linux distros back in the 90s
[04:49:38] <johnjay> that usually means it comes with the graphical environment presetup
[04:49:41] <knotMez> I think Pat is getting old
[04:49:47] <rascul> slackware is maintained
[04:49:52] <mlu> but the packaging system is so minimalist that it trades off system integrity
[04:50:01] <mlu> Arch is like Slackware, but with nice customization scripts

[04:50:47] <knotMez> Ubuntu is nice to start off with
[04:50:58] <johnjay> yes if you want the simplest possible thing start with ubuntu.
[04:51:00] <mlu> you want a Linux distro that just works: you use Ubuntu -- they spent the time and effort to keep it that way
[04:51:13] <johnjay> you'll be installing artix or solus linux eventually
[04:51:23] <johnjay> maybe even alpine!
[04:51:25] <knotMez> last time I ran Ubuntu I had to Google how to open a terminal though
[04:51:27] <mlu> Fedora is just basically a public alpha for future RHEL releases
[04:51:49] <johnjay> knotMez: yeah i hate it when they don't put termian in the little tookbar dock thing
[04:51:51] <knotMez> I  it was some hot key combination

[04:52:34] <mlu> Klinda: how would you pick Coke vs Pepsi vs RC Cola if you've never drank soda before?
[04:52:59] <johnjay> there was some reason why windows had the low res crappy cmd.exe and couldn't change it but i forgot

[04:53:30] <akk> Klinda: Ubuntu has the easiest installer and is set up for use by people who haven't used linux before. And it's very easy to find help by web searching when you have an ubuntu problem.
[04:53:36] <mlu> there's a machine that I have that runs Windows -- it's only for videogames
[04:53:41] <knotMez> Klinda can you play xbill in Windows?
[04:53:42] <mlu> my work machine runs Solus Linux
[04:53:45] <peetaur> I'd choose RC Cola cuz it's the cheapest... it still cleans the toilet just as well; and you wouldn't drink it anway, so the flavor doesn't matter.

[05:19:10] <akoana> Sintia: as root, what does   visudo --check say?
[05:19:14] <johnjay> i've wondered about debian repos. i think they drop those for before stable right?
[05:19:22] <nb-ben> 04 is LTS no?
[05:19:24] <johnjay> so if i have a jessie i can't apt update it now or?

[05:19:49] <Klinda> guess not

[05:21:18] <johnjay> so debian jessie repos do not work now?
[05:21:25] <johnjay> but 9 (stretch) and up do?

[05:22:03] <Sintia> akoana: say okay but sudoers.d its not okay
[05:22:29] <blackgatonegro> I guess I will go back to something else.
[05:23:11] <knotMez> I've been 2 releases behind on Debian and still been able to apt-get
[05:23:32] <djph> Klinda: you have to install either the current LTS release (e.g. 22.04 is the upcoming), or the previous (20.04), or the "current"  short term release (e.g. 21.10 will be "current" when 21.04 goes EOL)
[05:23:38] <Sintia> akoana: /etc/sudoers.d/README: bad permissions, should be mode 0440
[05:24:08] <knotMez> Klinda you can upgrade to the new release
[05:24:25] <djph> Klinda: in most cases, a "daily use" machine running Ubuntu will run a current LTS (at present, 18.04 or 20.04)

[05:25:37] <knotMez> Klinda personally I always do a fresh install when I upgrade
[05:25:38] <djph> ... so a machine running 18.04 will run 18.04 until 22.04 comes out
[05:25:53] <Klinda> for now I am trying the virtual machine btw
[05:25:58] <blackgatonegro> Thing is my motherboard is old, think I will stay with this version until is no longer supported.

[07:18:18] <kfrench> Notice: All unexpected fatal errors must be scheduled beforehand.
[07:18:30] <bewees> kfrench, Why do you need postfix if you use rsyslog (and it can send mails already), or wait rsyslog is only a mail client and you want postfix to queue?
[07:19:07] <kfrench> bewees: Yes - client+queue.  Sure, you could have rsyslog send email directly to your local email relay.

[11:02:38] <sheep> not really, though some filesystems do still support it
[11:03:20] <sheep> modern linux filesystems use extents instead of bitmap allocation so they usually allocate space in a way that's less likely to cause fragmentation

[17:22:38] <djph> fdan: a 'process' is an instance of a given application.  a thread is a segment of a process .
[17:22:39] <elkclone> good question. in what context. like for code different languages have different terms to describe things like multi thead, vrs light process, etc.
[17:23:12] <fdan> djph sure i googled that. i have worked in process all time.. what is actually a thread
[17:23:18] <fdan> what is the use of it
[17:23:22] <fdan> when do i use that
[17:23:23] <djph> well, in the most generic sense; and it'll probably be muddied a bit by usage in your chosen programming language / platform / etc
[17:23:32] <elkclone> ^^
[17:23:55] <z023> fdan a process can start multiple threads
[17:24:01] <z023> they all share their memory
[17:24:07] <djph> fdan: if you can have "a process" send two different requests off to two different processors at the same time --- you can use two threads.
[17:24:18] <elkclone> djph: makes the general case but it gets more specific with respect to what you are actually doing.
[17:24:44] <djph> elkclone: yeah, it gets really painful really fast, and I've not had nearly enough coffee yet ;)
[17:24:46] <fdan> z023 threads share the same memoey?
[17:24:52] <elkclone> hehe
[17:25:03] * elkclone hands strong west coast coffee to djph. 
[17:25:13] <z023> yes? if i create a thread with pthread_create for example, 0x12241234 is the same thing in both
[17:25:15] <djph> elkclone: hahahaha
[17:25:33] <z023> or whatever address i try using
[17:26:02] * djph honestly hasn't cared about multi-threading since dual-core procs were the big news of the day.  Nothing I've ever _really_ done has needed it.
[17:26:19] <elkclone> consider the difference in how python handles this vrs java or javascript
[17:26:22] <mundelj> let me put my penis in acetone
[17:26:28] <elkclone> omg. lol

[19:05:20] <Psi-Jack> KDE 3.x was great. 4.x had many MANY issues, especially early in, and never really fixed all the issues when 5 started spawning.
[19:05:22] <monopuff> Main issues I've had with KDE surround the compositor, and a NVIDIA card
[19:05:28] <asgas> I really don't see any issues with KDE. Few tiny bumps here and there, but nothing game breaking. KDE brought more to linux than gnome did in my opinion.
[19:05:28] <BluesKaj> I've been using KDE for over 15 yrs and it's more stable now than ever
[19:06:05] <phogg> Psi-Jack: I would personally recommend KDE as the go-to DE for anyone coming from Windows, or just anyone without any special interests. A few bugs are a small price to pay for a coherent system.
[19:06:24] <Psi-Jack> asgas: I'm a Gnome 3 guy. Always hated GNOME 1 and 2, originally hated 3 as well, but that's what I use today after having used KDE since the wee early days of it, pre 1.0.0 to 15.x
[19:06:27] <Psi-Jack> 5.x*
[19:06:51] <Psi-Jack> phogg: After seeing all the same bugs I still see, I just can't openly ever recommend KDE.
[19:06:57] <Psi-Jack> Not anymore.
[19:06:59] <monopuff> When you get used to being able to have your desktop "just so" with KDE, going to GNOME feels very restrictive imo
[19:07:18] <tsapien> Psi-Jack: what do you recommend to people who don't want to use gnome?
[19:07:19] <phogg> when you get used to control giving it up always feels bad

[19:07:58] <asgas> XFCE was great. Up till they added in CSDs.
[19:08:16] <biggusnickus> I think so too monopuff. The menu thing just take up all the screen opposed to a neat little thing you can place where you want on most other DE's
[19:08:30] <Psi-Jack> Klinda: Stability is mostly okay, though it will crash and auto-recover, but it's the UI glitches that really get me. And there's a lot of them. Flickery, imposing style over what it should be, etc.
[19:08:32] <hexnewbie> Meh, KDE 3.x fixed its issues very close to 3.5.10 release or something. It was very crash before that. And gone worse in 4.x. So there has been a small island where it was good. It does not bother me when I learn all the flaws and work around them, but to be chasing a stability that gets barely or never achieved before a new release going nuts is released is kind of annoying

[19:17:37] <hexnewbie> asgas: Krita is cool, and I would have been using it exclusively if I didn't have too much GIMP ingrained in my memory. That the entirety of KOffice was effectively killed and smothered, and Krita is the only piece that's flourished, however, exemplifies something.

[19:18:26] <Samnzdat> Finnish is allowed, but not Russian.  Interesting.
[19:18:35] <hexnewbie> asgas: Though that is mostly due to lack of developers, like Karbon is unmaintained. So it's not a fault of the KDE's vision for the future.
[19:18:44] <asgas> I don't like to imagine GIMP and krita as competing products. One is meant to manipulate images and the other one is for painting.
[19:18:47] <akik> Samnzdat: you really missed the point
[19:18:56] <Samnzdat> I don't give a shit.

[19:19:24] <hexnewbie> Yeah, I'm using my tablet in Krita exclusively. But I've been raised on painting programs as my main image manipulator, GIMP is too Photoshop-like

[19:19:32] <Psi-Jack> Klinda: Good question. Not sure.
[19:19:46] <asgas> Klinda, I imagine KDE has more bugs because they have more complex programs that gnome does.
[19:19:56] <Psi-Jack> They have entirely differing concepts, though,.
[19:20:35] <tesseract> maybe gnome isn't checked well like kde.
[19:20:42] <Psi-Jack> asgas: And yet, Evolution actually renders html email pretty much 100% perfectly. Even Dark/Light mode style.
[19:21:13] <asgas> If I was to use an email desktop client, I would rather use thunderbird over any DE specific mail program.
[19:21:24] <hexnewbie> Samnzdat: yoHbogh 'oHna' yoH law' Hoch tu'lu'.
[19:21:31] <BluesKaj> Klinda, KDE has more options than gnome etc, hence the chances of a few more bugs, but I haven't seen any for a few yrs that haven't been fixed almost immediately
[19:21:34] <coconut> BluesKaj, you 're still use kubuntu dev version or kde neon version today?
[19:21:39] <Psi-Jack> Thunderbird is my #2. It's good, it's accurate, but it doesn't follow dark/light mode as the only thing.
[19:21:52] <Psi-Jack> It's also, not Qt, which helps some too. 😉

[20:25:28] <pnbeast> luva, I guess that could be a system with a heating problem, but it sounds a lot like running out of memory.  So, I don't know any more than I did.

[20:33:21] <ayecee> the thing is, grub doesn't break by itself, so this doesn't address the root cause.
[20:33:31] <pnbeast> luva, if nothing in there looks crazy, I'd probably start making copies of any/all important files on the machine, storing them in one or two remote places.  Then, I'd probably fdisk the internal drives.  Then, trying to fix grub would seem fine, too.

I'd like to use BLUE to get to RAINBOW using RED as the middle man. So, BLUE will attempt to send packets to anywhere in RAINBOW, but since it's not there, they'll drop, right? But with "route add" I can tell it to
[20:34:09] <Guest3690> forward those to RED. RED will receive a packet directed to somewhere inside RAINBOW and will forward it (i.e. to PURPLE). How does that sound?

[20:45:58] <Guest3690> As I see it, in that case it says that all packets that are NOT my LAN, send it to the modem. Using that analogy, I want to add a rule where packets going to 10.x.x.x, send it to another computer instead of going to the modem. The other computer needs to be aware of that, and act as middleman. That's what confuses me, how to achieve that.

[20:49:39] <ayecee> Guest3690: if that's the case, then it should already work.
[20:49:43] <naterlater> Psi-Jack, but Windows11 has integration for X applications with WSLg
[20:49:49] <Guest3690> ayecee But do I have to do something in the linux box for that to work? or just enable ip forward in sysctl and that's it?
[20:49:49] <Endermen1094> my high school duesn't require any windoes apps and they use chromebook durring these times
[20:49:50] <ayecee> if it doesn't, then it's not already set up ;)
[20:50:00] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, I don't really care a spit about Windows any version.
[20:50:10] <ayecee> Guest3690: just enable ip forward, and i guess if you have a firewall, adjust the firewall.

[22:53:16] <Guest19> Hey, so I'm in a bit of a bind. I'm pretty new to linux, and I was trying to move my /usr folder into my /home partition and make a symbolic link to it back in / following this answer on StackExchange: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/116823 . I realized that I messed up when I deleted the original /usr before I could create a symbolic link,
[22:53:17] <Guest19> leaving me unable to use most commands. When I try to use them by referencing their path directly (e.g. /home/usr/bin/ls) I get "no such file or directory" despite it being there. Sorry about the long message, is anyone able to help me use basic commands again that aren't built-in?
[22:53:23] <luva> -e
[22:53:30] <ayecee> ah
[22:54:10] <luva> okay nothing hinting on errors in journalctl
[22:54:17] <Sauvin> Guest19, live media time! You need to back up all the stuff that would be hard to replace and re-install your Linux.
[22:54:25] <Mathisen> Guest19, you better of just re-installing if you did that
[22:54:30] <Sauvin> Guest19, also: why move /usr to /home?
[22:54:49] <ayecee> Guest19: you would need a static busybox installed to proceed from here. you can maybe shut down and use a liveusb to fix this.
[22:55:10] <Sauvin> Maybe. Reason I say what I do is: what ELSE might he have done?
[22:55:16] <ayecee> or hmm, maybe an LD_* variable. let's see.

[22:56:22] <ayecee> ah no, the reason you're getting that "no such file or directory" is that it can't find the dynamic linker.
[22:56:39] <ayecee> variables that control dynamic linker behavior won't help if it isn't running.
[22:57:18] <Guest19> Sauvin I want to put my installed programs on my /home partition because they're currently on the / partition, which is located on my ssd (with very limited space). I'm switching over from Windows, so the equivalent there that I was trying to get would be to make a different Program Files folder on a separate drive. Basically I wanted to install
[22:57:18] <Guest19> programs to my HDD instead of my SSD. Should I have gone with creating a separate partition for /usr?

[22:59:03] <Sauvin> Guest19, when installing new, if you create partitions and suchlike during setup and specify that one of them be mounted as /usr, then yes. The package manager won't get confused later on.

[23:55:17] <frazer97> MacOS isnt for the mass market - only the luxury desktop market
[23:55:18] <[[R]]> rustytaco: you're wrong... its the best OS in the world, according to Guest65
[23:55:24] <Sauvin> Guest65, we see lots of "toe dippers" using anything *but* Ubuntu.
[23:55:24] <rustytaco> mundelj: trolling here too?
[23:55:26] <mundelj> gono_cock_liah114
[23:55:31] <frazer97> and it dominated the premade luxury market
[23:55:38] <frazer97> *dominates
[23:55:44] <rustytaco> [R]: really? all i've had is trouble out of it. Linux has worked exceptionally well. Yes i've had to read and fix things BUT they were fixable
[23:55:47] <mundelj> rustytaco: where else?
[23:55:53] <[[R]]> rustytaco: obviously you're wrong... Guest65 says so
[23:56:07] <mundelj> absolutely not trolling
[23:56:07] <djph> rustytaco: oh, see, that's the problem.  You took the initiative to read.
[23:56:14] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[23:56:15] <Sauvin> Yeah. Linux is fixable. When Windows  blew  up, and it did that a lot, I could only rarely figure out what to do about it.
[23:56:17] <rustytaco> [[R]]: im not much for those not clever enough to figure out a nick
[23:56:23] <[[R]]> rustytaco: haha
[23:56:26] <rustytaco> Sauvin: Spot on. thats why i dont look back
[23:56:26] <djph> Sauvin: "install linux" ?
[23:56:37] <rasta> Sauvin exactly
[23:56:42] <Sauvin> djph, that's the conclusion I drew, yes. :D
[23:56:46] <frazer97> guys youre all really stupid, we all know chrome os is the best
[23:56:51] <frazer97> who we kidding
[23:56:55] <rasta> The Windows Registry is just a nightmare

[23:57:07] <[[R]]> Sauvin: its a jump to conclusions mat.... and its got conclusions... that you can JUMP to
[23:57:10] <Guest65> not everyone is a computer tech hobbyist, or knowledgeable enough to fix desktop issues. And even when they are (such as myself) you turn 30 and then it's "I'm too old for this shit", you dont have time to muck about anymore unless you sacrifice something else that's more important in the grand scheme of life
[23:57:14] <djph> frazer97: honestly, OS/2 Warp probably has it beat.

[23:57:26] <Sauvin> I get the impression the Windows Registry is just there to protect software firms' investment.
[23:57:26] <rustytaco> many years ago i had the chance to see MUCH of the windows XP source code
[23:57:36] * msiism realizes that most people have no clue whatsoever about operating systems, including himself.
[23:57:36] <rustytaco> I immediately went home and unplugged the ethernet from the windows machine
[23:57:46] <HEX0> I think it's faster to reinstall windows than to try to fix it, spend hours, fail to fix it then reinstall
[23:58:00] <frazer97> @djph that word is like voldemort
[23:58:04] <mundelj> gono_cock_liah114
[23:58:10] <mundelj> i will name my os
[23:58:10] <djph> HEX0: and then that didn't fix it, so spend the next 12 hours installing updates.

[23:58:26] <rasta> Guest65 What that helps... if the average user is told to 'reinstall windows', they ended up asking someone else, so Windows is not that reliable
[23:58:27] <rustytaco> mundelj: you should try going outside your mom's basement. it's pretty cool out there
[23:58:46] <Sauvin> frazer97, the point is, you have no point. Also, the point is, you're not going to change anybody's mind about anything here. You may as well just stand down and rest.
[23:58:47] <HEX0> djph: you'd think windows is a source based os lol
[23:58:50] <frazer97> rustytaco we're all in basements here buddy

[23:59:46] <rasta> I have seen too many people suffering with Windows desktop, if people don't know computers, the fact they use Mac, Windows or Linux doesn't matter
[23:59:47] <frazer97> Sauvin youre clearly a javaOS user
[23:59:49] <djph> I'm not in a basement
[23:59:51] <Guest65> rasta: you're talking language from a decade ago. Since Windows 8, Windows has self-repair. It will auto-diagnose boot issues, then tell its clueless user "uninstall recent security updates OR return to previous restore point OR reinstall windows (option to keep documents and apps, or just documents) OR complete factory reset" and they select an
[23:59:52] <Guest65> option. AFAIK Linux desktops dont have any of this.
[23:59:52] <rustytaco> Not sure how the stupid little shits get here in there
