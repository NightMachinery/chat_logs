[22:36:51] <countvajhula> hi all, I'm not sure where to start with this since it could either be a simple "yes that's the right thing, do that" or "you're doing it all wrong", so let me just provide some context first on an issue that I could use some advice on
[22:37:43] <countvajhula> i'm the author of symex.el, which is an evil state for structural editing for lisp code: https://github.com/countvajhula/symex.el
[22:38:02] <countvajhula> a user reported this issue: https://github.com/countvajhula/symex.el/issues/30
[22:40:00] <countvajhula> which is a minor issue, but the considerations around the fix bring up some underlying considerations that I thought it best to bring up
[22:40:09] <lisp123> countvajhula: Thanks, keen to hear your views
[22:41:08] <countvajhula> the surface issue we're seeing is that for vanilla Emacs (non-evil) users, the very first time they enter symex state, it also enters normal state, trigger normal state entry hooks
[22:41:16] <countvajhula> this does not happen on subsequent entry into symex state
[22:41:54] <countvajhula> i thought it might be because symex state has `:enable normal` in its definition but that doesn't explain why it doesn't happen after the first time
[22:42:17] <countvajhula> but the underlying implementation that makes this an issue is,
[22:42:39] <countvajhula> i use a minor mode map `symex-mode-map` to manage keybindings while in symex state
[22:42:53] <countvajhula> this minor mode is enabled upon entry into symex state, and disabled upon exit
[22:43:58] <lisp123> ok
[22:44:02] <countvajhula> as a result of the initial vanilla -> (enter symex state) -> normal -> symex behavior,
[22:44:19] <countvajhula> it ends up disabling the minor mode prior to actually entering symex state
[22:44:41] <countvajhula> and it looks like the minor mode _must_ be enabled prior to evil state entry in order for the bindings to be active
[22:45:18] <lisp123> Why does it disable the minor mode? Is it because of Evil mode removing all keymaps?
[22:45:25] <lisp123> upon initialisation
[22:45:25] <countvajhula> so it can't be done in a evil-symex-entry-hook but instead should be done in the main user-facing entry point
[22:46:45] <countvajhula> why indeed, i assume it's to disable the keybindings when not in symex state but I don't recall if there was another reason
[22:47:13] <lisp123> Can you do something like (eval-after-load "evil maps" ....)?
[22:47:27] <countvajhula> but before I confirm on that, does this sound like the right way to use an evil state? i.e. with an attendant minor mode managing the keybindings?
[22:48:13] <lisp123> countvajhula: Unfortunately I am a complete newb when it comes to evil-mode so I will refrain from comment
[22:49:07] <countvajhula> ok no worries
[22:49:29] <lisp123> Sounds like a question for the mailing list
[22:49:44] <countvajhula> re: why it disables the minor mode, it does so because we don't want those bindings active while in normal or other states
[22:50:06] <countvajhula> oh, what's the list email?
[22:50:26] <lisp123> mailing-list implementations-list@lists.ourproject.org
[22:51:10] <lisp123> I might look at the code of symex later, probably will be a good example to at least get me started
[22:51:23] <countvajhula> wait, that's the evil mailing list?
[22:52:26] <lisp123> Well it was the topic header: Topic: Evil = Extensible vi layer for Emacs | Current version: 1.14.0 | https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil | If you don't get an answer here, please use the mailing-list implementations-list@lists.ourproject.org
[22:52:55] <countvajhula> you're totally right
[22:53:13] <countvajhula> man, what an odd name for the evil mailing list but it looks legit
[22:53:22] <countvajhula> thanks for the pointer!
[22:53:44] <lisp123> no worries :)
[22:53:58] <lisp123> Evil mode is so cool, I'm so glad I made the switch
[22:55:10] <countvajhula> hehe nice lisp123 ! btw if you're new to evil bindings, I made a blog series not long ago that you may find helpful: https://countvajhula.com/2021/01/21/vim-tip-of-the-day-a-series/
[22:55:28] <lisp123> countvajhula: Thanks! Will read
[23:01:26] <lisp123> countvajhula: Looks like a great read
[23:01:52] <lisp123> p.s. do you know how to define keymaps in Evil for only certain major modes?
[23:12:12] *** Quits: famubu (~famubu@user/famubu) (Quit: leaving)
[23:12:16] <countvajhula> lisp123: I think you can use `evil-define-key` for that?
[23:13:26] <countvajhula> actually, maybe not
[23:13:59] <lisp123> countvajhula: No worries
[23:14:05] <countvajhula> you could try the recipe on this page: https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keymaps.html
[23:14:22] <countvajhula> by adding a major mode hook to enable the keybinding in the "local" map
[23:14:56] <lisp123> countvajhula: Perfect!
[23:15:01] <lisp123> Thanks
[23:15:10] <countvajhula> sure!
