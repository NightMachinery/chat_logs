[02:18:00] <unborn> amacater_: exatly you are right..
[02:18:15] <Khepra> it's not coming back, the problem with the policy requires something oracle won't do. it never was dropped from unstable, only testing and stable.

[02:19:49] <zenof> and thanks jelly , at least pointing to the #vbox . this actually could be helpful.
[02:19:54] <amacater_> zenof: If you're in a position to convert it to another format that virt-manager can ingest, we might be able to help more.
[02:20:03] <Khepra> amacater_: it's not a problem bumping it in unstable. problem is when you carve out a version for stable. that one you can't bump without bringing new features and breakage -- which, ain't problem on unstable
[02:20:28] <jelly> zenof, feel free to ignore unborn, he's often too eager to comment without a lot of constructive content
[02:20:53] <amacater_> So yes, it'll trickle down to testing - then _maybe_ backports - but since it isn't in stable at the moment, that might be OK.
[02:20:56] <unborn> zenof: no - I think you have somehow not capable to take in what I am saying yo you and others since I told you - debian does not use virtualbox crapware a long long time. you said you using others user machine I said you sould not.. and also I said this is not debian issue. - thanks.
[02:21:22] <unborn> thanks Jelly.
[02:21:44] <Khepra> when virtiofs becomes standard part of stable's kernel and qemu, vbox will have lost the last reason to be used
[02:22:05] <zenof> amacater_, the problem is that I can run 'VBoxClient --vmsvga' manually, and it immedieatly enables dynamic adaption of the guest dsiplay resolution. however, the service I wrote for it doesn't seem to work.
[02:22:36] <zenof> so, I don't really see why converting it to another format might help, but maybe I'm wrong.
[02:23:00] <amacater_> zenof: I'd honestly suggest to go ask Oracle / virtualbox experts elsewhere. Not wishing to be difficult but we haven't even got a package to install to help you resolve problems.

[02:23:23] <jelly> zenof, it's possible the command relies on something in the enviroment that a service misses.  Eg. if it does something X server specific, see if setting correct DISPLAY env var helps.
[02:23:44] <amacater_> zenof: If you were to convert it to an open format that qemu/kvm could use, then we could pull it into Debian supported virtualisation solutions
[02:25:07] <zenof> but in an Debian supported virtualisation solution(thus anything else but vbox) there wouldn't be '/usr/bin/VBoxClient' nor the vbox-guest-additions, right? ;)

[02:37:20] <amacater_> sid == Debian unstable == permanent codename
[02:37:44] <jelly> a specific build with extra features is non-free.
[02:38:13] <amacater_> And all usefully managed by Oracle - AVOID
[02:38:23] <unborn> eh.. not quiet on virtual machine yet - sid is fine and stable - but some features you might find not working or have some bugs but its fine, its very stable on my end test machines.
[02:38:43] <amacater_> !sns
[02:38:43] <dpkg> Shiny New Shit Syndrome is a serious disorder, which usually breaks out into an epidemic every time something new is released.  If you have SNS, ask me about <backports> and <ssb>; these are better options than upgrading to <testing> because it is a <moving target>.
[02:39:07] <amacater_> Doubly so for unstable: it breaks, you get to keep both pieces :)
[02:39:26] <unborn> amacater_: that's why I drove client from desires like this, however even you feel free to mute me ;)
[02:39:26] <jelly> sid is not "fine and stable"; the reason the packages are only in sid is due to incompatible release policy for upstream and debian
[02:39:31] <jmcnaught> zenof: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-resizing says something about VBoxClient getting started during desktop session initialization.  Maybe it should be run by your user not as a system service?  Perhaps it even comes with a file for /etc/xdg/autostart/ or a systemd user .service unit.
[02:40:26] <jelly> amacater_, "AVOID" is not a constructive approach if the user has repeatedly said they cannot use anything else at the moment
[02:40:50] <unborn> jelly: but we can complete them - so we can fix and use them, right? once poll is stable we join.. I am just saying, for me is more stable then issues.. well it had been.
[02:40:52] <jelly> if you can't say anything helpful... be quiet.
[02:40:55] <amacater_> jelly: Maybe - but this list is not really in a position to help him significantly

[20:44:37] <leeuw1976> Hi Guys Need help UFW to configure wireguard. This guy (me) is keeps tracing it's own tail. Somewhere I am not hearing the bell. I need experience with wireguard and ufw (or iptables) rules. Problem: wireguard works fine. 2 different subnets for wireguard clients. login works fine. Using vpn fine. Surfing the net fine. Connection to the servers' dns from inside the vpn connection, fine. openvpn server which is working fine from a separated subnet, it
[20:44:37] <leeuw1976> works fine. Only I have one problem. Wireguard clients, seem te be able to visit eachother by the wg0 and wg1 network. That is highly undesirable in my setup. I tried to fiddel with ufw and use rules to block that traffic. Not working. Does anyone has experience with this kind of stuff?

[22:11:30] <NthDegree> Na_Klar, might be worth asking the manufacturer if it needs loadable firmware at runtime

[22:11:53] <Na_Klar> you can't ask the chineese stuff ..

[22:14:39] <somiaj> though it is best to know what gpu you have to decide if that is possibly the issue or not
[22:15:04] <somiaj> also linux = kernel which has the drivers/and loads firmware, so it might be linux related

[22:15:37] <Na_Klar> yes, but then simply the driver is crap, since it is the one the manufacturer patched into it.
[22:15:56] <Na_Klar> which is totally believable btw.
[22:16:23] <somiaj> you could look at Xorg.0.log and see exactly which xorg driver is being detected/used
[22:19:51] <Na_Klar> somiaj: https://pastebin.com/3k5jWgrJ
[22:23:19] <somiaj> Okay, yea it could be that gpu just needs extra care. you are using the 'fbdev' driver in xorg, which is kinda old/dated and that is probably why you are having issues. I'm unsure of any tweaks you can do with that driver (most modern cards use modesetting drivers, not framebuffers)

[22:26:51] <nobody292> as I can see here [https://github.com/RainLoop/rainloop-webmail/issues/2160], it probably includes a version of it which claims to be licensed under a custom non-free license (it is uncertain) and it does phoning home

[23:57:43] <somiaj> nobody292: you will have to download the source package to see what was removed from the source, since that is what the dsfg version number means. Debian has repackaged the upstream source to remove non-free stuff to make it meet the DFSG
[23:57:55] *** Joins: extra_medium (~sentinel@user/sentinel/x-2761183)
