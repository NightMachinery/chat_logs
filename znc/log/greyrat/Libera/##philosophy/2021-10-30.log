[00:28:30] <Atque> Delf: Those characters are the ones you should be afraid of.
[00:29:14] <Delf> Why is that? Because there's got to be something seriously wrong with them if they never loose their shits?
[00:29:29] <pussipupu> They seemed pretty rude a lot to me

[00:31:09] <pussipupu> People have different perceptions of things to be fair

[09:30:14] <cobaltX4> Same here. I'm tired of code and being mired in half-understood conceptual arcs....Need a break. and I just happen to rather enjoy philosophy.
[09:31:06] <chatguy> haha okay. i'm not a coder or techie. just an old-school geek, i guess.
[09:31:10] <chatguy> and partial freak.
[09:31:19] <pussipupu> General philosophy
[09:31:22] <chatguy> happy to discuss almost any philosophical or religious topic
[09:31:23] <cobaltX4> I'll be honest, I'm new to irc. Didn't get into it as I was growing up. And made a trajectory change into tech after being a jazz musician.
[09:31:38] <cobaltX4> Awesome!

[09:32:28] <chatguy> well I like Christanity, but as I said I'm open to most topics
[09:33:06] <cobaltX4> ah! Do you get into Kierkegaard?
[09:33:24] <chatguy> i don't know him but am open to hearing about him. i don't know much formal philosophy or philosophers
[09:33:59] <cobaltX4> Ok, well if you're into christianity you'll appreciate his life and his work
[09:34:18] <chatguy> okay. happy to hear about it
[09:34:54] <cobaltX4> He was responsible for the advent of Nihilism, and eventually being spun into Existentialism by sartre.
[09:35:06] <chatguy> okay...
[09:35:15] <chatguy> doesn't sound very Christian ;)
[09:35:24] <cobaltX4> well, that was earlier on
[09:35:42] <cobaltX4> he eventually converted and became deeply influenced by christianity
[09:36:17] <chatguy> okay
[09:36:56] <cobaltX4> he was a drunk, opium addles teen/young adult until he had a near death experience at 25 or so.....it was late 1800s Copenhagen, so he was very much at odds with his father for that reason
[09:37:14] <chatguy> ok
[09:38:36] <cobaltX4> Anyway! I personally relate to him and he is definitely important for bringing in the beginning of modern philosophy. Sorry for rambling. I don't get to talk to interesting people often
[09:38:59] <chatguy> sure. happy to chat, as i said. i don't relate with him thus far, except for the drunk part

[09:44:12] <chatguy> how old r u, brother?

[09:44:27] <cobaltX4> I'm 32. How about you, my friend?
[09:44:31] <chatguy> 40
[09:44:45] <chatguy> one more year before the crucifix
[09:45:02] <cobaltX4> He would write a paper, publish it and wait for other philosophers to remark
[09:45:12] <chatguy> that's generally how it works, i guess
[09:45:20] <cobaltX4> then he would write a rebuttal under a pseudonym
[09:46:03] <cobaltX4> and repeat the process over the course years until he felt the philosophical community around him had exhausted.

[10:11:41] <cobaltX4> Of course. I feel like the fact that the US has experienced such growth in the last 100 years while being very young as a country and government does not bode well for a lasting empire.

[10:23:29] <cobaltX4> I know I'm flawed and capable of the most human of human behavior, but I am regularly disgusted (especially) by corporate greed and the blatant as well as minute/pseudo corruption it brings to our systems of governance

[10:30:10] <cobaltX4> It truly is (emotional intelligence). I was always rather melancholic and stuck in a different place than kids I grew up with. My grandparents raised me and I didn't know my parents, so from day one I've been an outsider.
[10:30:37] <cobaltX4> and I didn't realize that I had emotional intelligence until the last couple of years

[10:38:04] <cobaltX4> Ok, hopefully I don't sound ignorant. I just got out of the mental health/social services field so I am still interested
[10:38:36] <cobaltX4> How does the sensation or state of loneliness manifest itself in your life eventually?
[10:38:51] <cobaltX4> To where it makes your life unmanageable?
[10:39:11] <cobaltX4> What are the worst parts
[10:39:59] <chatguy> haha well i have a lot of challenges on many levels. but aside from that, the fact i spend most of my time alone and have hardly any friends and no real social support and my emotional needs have never been met, drives me to drink, and one day will prob lead me to shuffle off this mortal coil
[10:41:08] <chatguy> i distract myself with things that if i was 'well' and functional could possibly be revolutionary
[10:41:19] <cobaltX4> Yeah....I know it's hard to take strangers seriously, but I completely understand. I have been there before. Definitely in a different capacity, but I know what it is like
[10:41:43] <chatguy> yeah, you're a sweet guy. as i said, i'm happy to stay in touch if ur willing, but no pressure
[10:42:12] <cobaltX4> Haha. As long as you don't say "no pressure" again.
[10:42:22] <chatguy> ;)
[10:42:41] <chatguy> Under Pressure - good song
[10:42:41] <cobaltX4> I am grateful to make thoughtful friends.... I've been in an isolated state for the last 3 months
[10:43:33] <cobaltX4> I had a motorcycle accident on my sportbike.....I got very lucky. And I just didn't want to leave my apartment.
[10:43:46] <chatguy> I see
[10:43:50] <cobaltX4> I am an introvert
[10:44:48] <cobaltX4> But I do best if I'm not always isolated, so part of getting on irc was about socializing in some way
[10:45:26] <chatguy> yeah irc has prob been my main 'social' outlet in life
[10:46:56] <cobaltX4> The place you seem to be in, I haven't experienced something like that in 5 years since I quit drugs/alcohol. and I really feel for you. Just know, that I have experienced awakening from that dark place  even though I knew it was impossible. until that point....
[10:47:13] <chatguy> I'm glad to hear it
[10:47:18] <cobaltX4> So It's possible.

[11:20:29] <Digit> philosophy and religion, and non-mainstream views.... like how kaneh bosm in the bible's holy annointing oil recipe had been mistranslated, and has been discovered (last century actually, now re-emphasized by chris bennett's studies, and reaffirmed by archeological discoveries), is actually cannabis.

[11:26:22] <Digit> uh, so you're not interested in the lense of all your experience?   ( as per several scholars/researchers depict and explain, e.g. https://realitysandwich.com/dennis-mckenna/ )
[11:26:23] <ro-bot-o> [url] Trippy Talk: We are Made of Drugs with Dennis Mckenna | realitysandwich.com
[11:26:29] <amigojapan> Digit: I think in the past people mainly thought hallucinations were real
[11:26:56] <chatguy> i'm not that interested in drugs but happy to discuss ideas, etc.
[11:27:24] <Digit> amigojapan: i'm not into hallucinogens (nor dissociatives).  much prefer psychedelics or entheogens.
[11:27:43] <chatguy> if i was interested in drugs i'd prob prefer to do them rather than talk about them heh :)
[11:27:49] <amigojapan> I see Digit
[11:27:55] <chatguy> but i know lots of ppl love talking about drugs. i'm just not among them.
[11:28:34] <Digit> chatguy: but, you are drugs, your ideas are mediated by the drugs that cause your experience.  you are a drug factory.  dont let decietful greedy manipulators convince you only some exogenous things are drugs and all drugs are bad.  n_n
[11:28:52] <chatguy> Digit those are some unfounded assertions :)
[11:29:03] <Digit> chatguy: how can you assert such?   XD
[11:29:14] <Digit> check your epistemology, cha cha cha.
[11:29:23] <chatguy> I think who and what I am is an open question to be considered and discussed
[11:29:36] <chatguy> ontology, sure
[11:29:54] <amigojapan> The brain is a chemical machine
[11:29:59] * Digit nods
[11:30:11] <chatguy> I don't identify myself with a brain
[11:30:29] <Digit> starting to see that.  yeah.  XD
[11:30:36] <Digit> (teehee)
[11:31:03] <chatguy> well, if you identify yourself with a brain then I don't see the point of drugs beyond entertainment
[11:31:34] <amigojapan> Digit: but that is a good reason to regulate your chemical intake, cause of how it affects the brain
[11:33:58] <chatguy> nothing wrong with entertainment, of course, but my entertainment in this channel is philosophy or intelligent discussion
[11:34:01] <Digit> chatguy: it's interesting how suddenly stubbornly entrenched and recoiling you seem to have got, in contrast to your claim that you were interested in "philosophy and religion, and non-mainstream views", which inspired me to raise the matter of cannabis's central role in religion (and philosophy), which is a non-mainstream view...   does somewhat look like drug-war propaganda looming and lurking in your thinking.
[11:34:25] <chatguy> I have no issue with drugs. I'm Libertarian
[11:34:51] <chatguy> are you saying religion is just drug-induced hallucinations?
[11:34:59] <Digit> chatguy: allll your experience, is a drug experience.  it's inseperable.  even the afterlife, would not be there, without DMT.
[11:35:26] <chatguy> lol I think the afterlife, by definition, is not based on brains
[11:35:36] <amigojapan> chatguy: God experiences probably are in a large amount
[11:36:00] <chatguy> amigojapan that is one perspective, sure. I know ur a materialist.
[11:36:04] <Digit> chatguy: no.  i'd not say hallucinations.  that's a misleading inaccuracy.   you could try stretch the term, so that you could say all experience/perception is a hallucination, but then the term becomes so broad as to be meaningless.
[11:36:52] <Digit> chatguy: idk about "based on", "mediated by" might be closer?   *shrug*.
[11:37:15] <chatguy> well I'm not particularly interested in hallucinations. if there is truth to religion, then I'm interested.
[11:37:27] <chatguy> if it's just some peeps trippin then I don't find it so interesting :)
[11:37:38] <Digit> moses and the burning bush, seems to have been (iirc) acacia, for the DMT in it.  entheogenic.
[11:37:53] <chatguy> ok. i don't know
[11:38:06] <amigojapan> chatguy: there may be truth in religion but not in the abrihamic religions
[11:38:34] <chatguy> amigojapan I would disagree. Although I believe there is more spiritual truth in Dharmic traditions, I think Abrahamic religions still contain some spiritual truth
[11:38:52] *** goli is now known as assan
[11:39:37] <amigojapan> chatguy: the God of the abrihamic religions, even assuming he exists is not worship wordy
[11:39:59] <Digit> and "I don't see the point of drugs beyond entertainment" is a disturbing statement to me still... missing SO much.   many of the psychedelic experiences would not be well described as "entertainment", both for the level of significance, and enjoyment.  e.g. an ayuhuasca trip, or an iboga trip, where serious work is done on the psyche and perception and can radically shift/augment/expand philosophies... and such things are central to
[11:39:59] <Digit> many religions.
[11:40:10] <amigojapan> chatguy: I suggest looking into deism
[11:40:18] <chatguy> amigojapan there are thousands if not millions of gods in the Abrahamic religions
[11:40:47] <chatguy> Digit I think u missed my contextualising caveat :)
[11:41:01] <chatguy> amigojapan I'm an omnitheist
[11:41:35] <amigojapan> Alright chatguy I was taking about yhwh specifically
[11:42:16] <Digit> cool, so, aware it was not monotheistic in its roots.   ... as chris bennett's work highlights, with many citations, there were sometimes some ruckus when multiple gods were worshiped in the same temple, and the gods were each tied to some plant (/"drug").
[11:44:03] <chatguy> amigojapan there are as many conceptions of yhwh as there are Abrahamics
[11:44:06] <Digit> chatguy: i did not miss it, i just found it inconsequential.  removing "if you identify yourself with a brain"  makes no difference, to how disturbingly blinkered (and even potentially subtextually wilfully ignorant) i found the "I don't see the point of drugs beyond entertainment"
[11:44:28] <chatguy> amigojapan every Bible author doubtless had HIS own version/conception of YHWH (and all the other gods)
[11:44:28] <amigojapan> True chatguy
[11:45:00] <chatguy> Digit have I said something to offend you? my perception is that u have some hostility towards me
[11:45:18] <Digit> what makes you ask that?   *shrug*
[11:45:25] <chatguy> Digit lol
[11:46:01] <Digit> "the ignorance that dies is not you".   you are not under threat, no hostility here.
[11:46:09] <chatguy> If all we are is brains then I don't see the purpose of drugs beyond entertainment, for we already know what we are and what reality is
[11:46:13] <_candle_> I think he is just extremely frank from time to time
[11:46:18] <amigojapan> Digit: my plant of choose is coffee
[11:46:35] <amigojapan> Choice*
[11:46:55] <chatguy> for me the purpose of ayahuasca and DMT and psychedelics is to give ppl a glimpse beyond the physical dimension
[11:47:02] <chatguy> into a deeper dimension of who they are
[11:47:08] <Digit> i'd not say all we are is brains.  i'm much enthused by "atman is brahman" and perceptions of seeing each our infinite extents.   ... perceptions i was helped re-enthused to, by entheogens.
[11:47:36] <chatguy> yes I understand that drugs are spiritually helpful for many people
[11:47:42] *** Quits: Ungwelian (Every1@88-113-233-115.elisa-laajakaista.fi) (Quit: Z_z :))
[11:47:45] <Digit> amigojapan: mine would be cannabis.   saved my life.   can save the world.   most utility of any plant.   food, fuel, fiber, medicine, and more.
[11:48:52] <Digit> "for me the purpose of ayahuasca and DMT and psychedelics is to give ppl a glimpse beyond the physical dimension"  seems a sudden turn around from the prior assertions.  XD
[11:50:13] <Digit> reminds me "everybody's saying the same thing, just differently".  lol.
[11:50:22] <chatguy> Digit hm?
[11:51:01] <chatguy> as I said, I understand that drugs are spiritually helpful for many ppl
[11:51:02] <Digit> it had seemed you were utterly closed to such ideas, from everything else you'd said prior.
[11:51:13] <chatguy> you misinterpreted me
[11:51:26] <Digit> clearly so, lest that was a turn around.
[11:51:34] <chatguy> I'm spiritual; I'm just not interested in drugs, but accept they are helpful, spiritually and medicinally
[11:52:55] <Digit> i'm still perplexed by your twice asserted if brains then drugs only for entertainment.  seems to contradict this.
[11:53:25] <Digit> how does a brain-centric materialist view reduce the utility of "drugs" to mere entertainment?
[11:54:28] <chatguy> because if we are just brains then drugs aren't giving any insight into the nature of reality beyond chemical interactions
[11:54:31] <chatguy> for entertainment
[11:54:43] <chatguy> but if we are more than brains then maybe drugs can give some deeper insight into who we really are
[11:55:03] <chatguy> anyone who thinks we are brains or the consequences of brains hasn't thought very deeply about reality
[11:55:10] <chatguy> and has no insight into the true nature of being
[11:55:36] <chatguy> their opinions are basically wortheless
[11:55:43] <Digit> surely, in brain-centric perceptions of ourselves, our umwelt/experience/grok, all experience is drugs, including all beyond entertainment and entertainment... no?
[11:56:21] <chatguy> it's whatever you want it to be, brother. i'd call it entertainment, unless you think you can ascertain some deeper knowledge from drugs beyond "we are brains"
[11:56:31] <Digit> "if we are just brains then drugs aren't giving any insight into the nature of reality beyond chemical interactions"  o_O  yeah, i'm not getting how you come to that conclusion.  doesnt make sense to me to reduce it so.
[11:56:44] <chatguy> what insights have drug given you?
[11:56:56] <Digit> top of the list, i got to experience omniscience...
[11:57:06] <Digit> learned that's an experience open to us all.
[11:57:12] <chatguy> if you're just a brain then i doubt you can experience omniscience
[11:57:18] <Digit> just for, one exogenous example.
[11:57:50] <chatguy> and if you were omniscient you would know you're not a brain :)
[11:58:25] <Digit> could argue all insights i've ever had, i would not have had, if not for drugs, since, i am a drug factory, and cannot have a thought without the drugs.  the drugs are /the/ mediators of all insights.  along with the physiology and electromagnetism etc.
[11:58:51] <chatguy> that is the materialist perspective
[11:59:09] <plankster> ugh, preachy drug users
[11:59:18] <chatguy> hi plankster
[11:59:18] <plankster> please stop ruining it for the rest of us
[11:59:57] <Digit> idk if that's a blurred line of perspectives and semantics.  i can see from vantage points where we're not a brain, where our experience is lensed through a brain... what then is the extents of "you".   like i say, i appreciate "atman is brahman".
[12:00:34] <chatguy> if you appreciate "atman is brahman" then you know consciousness has very little to do with brains
[12:01:07] <Digit> plankster: what's ruining it for you about this exploration of the lense through which we experience and philosophize etc?
[12:01:20] <Digit> chatguy: how does that follow?
[12:01:44] <chatguy> brahman is consciousness. atman is simply an individuation or unit of that cosmic consciousness
[12:01:48] <chatguy> it is a quantum of the continuum
[12:01:49] * Digit nods
[12:02:08] <Digit> and "la la la, brains have nothing to do with it" holds no traction with me.
[12:02:14] <chatguy> that's nice
[12:02:39] <Digit> i do not see how that becomes excluded?   it's like "i embrace all that is... except that bit."  XD
[12:02:48] <chatguy> hm?
[12:02:51] <mannequin> what do you think about entropy?
[12:02:53] <plankster> its stupid, mostly
[12:03:09] <Digit> plankster: try a little higher up the debate pyramid.
[12:03:15] <plankster> no thanks
[12:03:19] <mannequin> entropy stupid? how so?
[12:03:22] * Digit nods.
[12:03:23] <plankster> no not you
[12:04:50] <chatguy> using Hindu terminology without Hindu philosophy seems a bit strange to me
[12:05:03] <Digit> o_O
[12:05:12] <chatguy> Hinduism isn't materialism; it's idealism
[12:05:31] <chatguy> what am I not embracing?
[12:05:50] <chatguy> brains and electrochemical impulses?
[12:06:07] <Digit> i actually find hinduism one of the most openly all embracing religions there is.  my fave religion in fact.  i do not see it do this "it's only this, it's not this", and instead includes all perspectives.
[12:06:25] <chatguy> Hinduism isn't materialism. that much is certain
[12:06:37] <chatguy> it's a religion, based on spiritual principles, most central of which is, of course, idealism
[12:06:41] <Digit> it does not say material reality does not exist though.
[12:06:59] <chatguy> that's nice, i guess? :)
[12:07:23] <chatguy> i don't think anyone denies material reality exists
[12:07:27] <Digit> and also, it's many religions.
[12:07:37] <Digit> chatguy: well, it was starting to look like you were.
[12:07:55] <chatguy> Digit I think u tend to make presumptuous interpretations :)

[12:08:27] <Digit> oh wittgenstein oh wittgenstein, however will we understand each other.  n_n
[12:08:48] <chatguy> well if one of us can be a bit less egotistical and presumptuous then it might be easier :P
[12:09:06] <Digit> chatguy: now are you the one with hostility?  lol.    sure, none of us are infinitely perfect with our cognitive aptitudes.
[12:09:20] <chatguy> i'm being playful
[12:09:22] <Digit> lol.
[12:09:36] <Digit> difficult, i'd call it.  ;p  lol.
[12:09:50] <chatguy> for you, perhaps :)
[12:10:13] <Digit> for clarity.
[12:10:26] <chatguy> i'm happy to answer any question to the best of my ability
[12:10:32] <chatguy> including clarification of anything i say
[12:10:50] <chatguy> i appreciate clarity and charity
[12:11:10] <chatguy> both of which i consider severely lacking in this world
[12:13:04] <Digit> both of which, i consider can be helped, in part, by alleviating the world of the prejudices against "drugs" (and that over-generalisation and obfuscation by narrowed definition/perception), especially the ones which, as bill hicks put it, "help you see how you're being f***ed every day of your life" [by the same people/groups/motivations that invest heavily in encouraging those prejudices].
[12:13:35] <chatguy> as i said, i have no issue with drugs; i'm Libertarian
[12:13:43] <chatguy> and I can guarantee you Bill Hicks wasn't a materialist
[12:13:50] <chatguy> and isn't one
[12:15:28] <Digit> you also said, several times, you were not interested in drugs.   and that drugs are just for entertainment (with your (i think, inconsequential) caveat).   which to me seems in contradiction, given how central drugs are to our existence, our perception, philosophy and religion...
[12:15:57] <chatguy> I'm not interested in drugs, personally. I said if all we are is brains then drugs are just for entertainment (and medicine).
[12:16:14] <chatguy> obviously you are very interested in drugs. that is fine. I'm just a different person.
[12:17:20] <Digit> psychopharmacology n such, neurochemistry, psychology, all impinge upon, as the lense/filter/mediator, to our philosophising.   variations in our neurochemistry alter how we'd be having this discussion and the perceptions therein, and the perceptions therein from the discussion, likewise alter our endogenous drug coctails.
[12:17:40] <chatguy> so what is your point?
[12:19:37] <Digit> like the dmt=death(/afterlife) thing, i think people get hung up on, perhaps, by rigidly linear temporal conceptions of reality, and cannot conceive how an experience that can be seen as embedded in a short span of time in physical reality could open to transtemporal spiritual realities... perhaps somewhat analagous to missing the [space]time bending properties in physics, like around blackholes and whiteholes.
[12:20:52] <chatguy> basic materialism...
[12:21:22] <chatguy> you're a materialist. I get that. I'm not.
[12:21:49] <Digit> maybe i read too much openmindedness in your original "I like chatting about philosophy and religion, and non-mainstream views" that prompted my original query, and have just been wrestling with the contrast of your excluding...
[12:21:54] <Digit> i'd not describe myself so.
[12:22:03] <Digit> i entertain many perspectives.
[12:22:14] <chatguy> materialism is a very mainstream perspective
[12:22:19] <chatguy> i find it boring, tbh

[12:25:31] <Digit> groupthink*
[12:25:36] <chatguy> ...
[12:27:09] <Digit> like i say, i'd not describe myself a materialist, but entertain many perspectives.   not picking a camp.   i advocate non-belief, and i suppose along with that, comes some kinds of non-attachment and not-identifying with any labelled philosophy.
[12:27:24] <chatguy> okay

[12:30:07] <chatguy> glad to hear it. otherwise we would prob have little to discuss

[12:30:35] <ro-bot-o> Digit meant to say: rejected religion from about age 4 or 5, still forced to go to church until 12, rediscovered the baby i'd thrown out with the bathwater at 17, via psychedelics/entheogens, realising what hijacked religion's middlemen had been obfuscating, ending what you could call my "militant atheist [materialist(?)]" period, and the arrogance and ignorance that comes along with that.
[12:30:59] <Digit> hoh, n1 ro-bot-o.   thought the extra characters after that would throw you.  n-n
[12:31:36] <chatguy> ;)
[12:31:58] <Digit> chatguy: yes, somewhat.  i propose largely because of their stubborn certainty in their mono-perspective.   similar to other dogmatists with their one-true-way.
[12:32:25] <chatguy> Digit right. they are just ignorant egos.
[12:32:39] <chatguy> truth ("science" and "philosophy") requires an open mind and a pure heart
[12:32:51] <chatguy> without those things, people have little value except as agents of darkness
[12:33:38] <Digit> but still... maybe best not to overly "they" them.  tis leadingly "othering" labelling language.   i forget who espoused this ... (feynman maybe?... robert anton wilson...?   i forget)   ... but perhaps better to have at least an "-ing" suffix, so it's more just what they happen to be doing, rather than what they are.
[12:34:12] <chatguy> haha maybe. i'm no spiritual master and have no interest in striving to be so :)
[12:34:25] <chatguy> i have no issue with calling certain people useless (at least to me ;)  )
[12:34:44] <chatguy> i'm happy to be a pseudo-sociopath. only difference between me and most if that i admit it.
[12:35:00] <Digit> yeah, at the edges of materialism(ing (~ lol)), there's "outs".   like via quantum mechanics, or, entheogens/psychedelics.
[12:35:18] <chatguy> sure, but those outs require openness and humility
[12:35:24] <Digit> mind/conception expanding things.
[12:35:39] <chatguy> otherwise, if you blaspheme against the holy spirit, there can be no redemption in this life
[12:38:06] <Digit> chatguy: (re: requires openness and humility) in some ways, perhaps.   but... a heroic to legendary dose of magic mushrooms will likely not require openness and humility, once in the throws of it, to have such a mind expanding "out".   ... maybe some to get there to take the dose in the first place (lest spiked, which would be a terrible idea, with potentially terrible consequences, lacking any preparatory [mind]set [and setting].
[12:38:51] <chatguy> i think u will find that those without any real openness or humility will eventually return to their old ways of thinking
[12:39:02] <chatguy> and rationalise their experience as "chemicals"
[12:39:08] <Digit> methinks it simply would not let one keep the doors of perception closed.     ... maybe there are exceptions though.   overly calcified pineal glands or whatever it might be.
[12:39:34] <chatguy> spirituality (and any apprehension of truth at all) requires character
[12:39:40] <chatguy> absent character, there can be no wisdom
[12:39:47] <chatguy> there is no short cut to character
[12:39:57] <chatguy> drugs may act as an accelerant to those who are ready
[12:40:14] <Digit> i can entertain the perspective, seeing from where the chemical roles appear prominent, but i would not limit to that being the one true perspective, nor would i exclude its importance.
[12:40:14] <chatguy> but for those who are not ready, I propose the effects of drugs will not be deep or lasting

[12:40:59] <chatguy> if the were truly advanced beings they wouldn't need drugs
[12:41:03] <chatguy> drugs are toys
[12:41:11] <Digit> "the effects of drugs"... "drugs"... it's just too broad for my liking, to make such assertions.  there's too much variety.
[12:41:46] <chatguy> any idiot can take drugs
[12:42:14] <Digit> both endogenous (which we're experiencing now) and exogenous (probably experiencing some of that too), have such a wide array of effects.
[12:42:27] <chatguy> you won't find God in drugs. if God could be achieved by drugs then She wouldn't be worthy of worship.
[12:43:45] <kmh> drugs are us?
[12:44:15] <_candle_> Rastafarians may disagree
[12:44:21] <Digit> where would we be, without seratonin, oxytocin, dopamine, adrenaline, for example.   and the feedback loops they provide.  the learned experience, the neuropathways formed, strengthened, pruned, shaped, by those neurochemicals, by the electromagnetic/wave sensory experiences, cumulatively, how we shape/form/learn/develop character and more through these pathways...
[12:44:38] <kmh> _candle_,  what about Pastafarians?
[12:45:02] <_candle_> Haha
[12:45:09] <chatguy> that is just the workings of the brain. you don't need drugs to use your brain properly. and when you leave this earth you won't need a physical brain at all.
[12:45:15] <chatguy> the brain is a prison
[12:45:34] <kmh> and you want to break out?
[12:45:58] <chatguy> that would be ideal but maybe not wise :)
[12:46:32] <kmh> hmmmm
[12:46:33] <Digit> chatguy: your assertions are near falling contradictory to my already espoused experiences... though, i tend avoid the word "god".  entheogenic experience, and omniscient experience.   "you won't find God in drugs"... are you sure?   check again the origins of religion, as being rediscovered and re-emphasised by the likes of chris bennett and the archeological discoveries reaffirming his assertions that build on the work of sula benet.
[12:46:48] <kmh> so the ideal thing is not wise
[12:46:59] <kmh> if that ain't a conundrum
[12:47:10] <chatguy> yeah I'm sure. any idiot can have an hallucination or even a spiritual experience. That isn't finding God, much less becoming God.

[12:52:38] <chatguy> we are all God. I get that.
[12:52:47] <Digit> the "so what"... if a real question, and not a rhetorical dismissive...       ... ummm..   my main take-away revelation from it, was simply that it exists, as an experience available to us all, not exclusive and separate and unreachable and preserved for "the man in the clouds".  n_n   and that many beings all around the cosmos may be experiencing it "right now".
[12:53:04] <chatguy> i agree
[12:53:19] <chatguy> i didn't need to take drugs to understand that. but i understand that many do. all good.
[12:54:44] <Digit> and no, i do not expect people tho just swallow that claim as true.   that'd be a dubiously naive and gullible leap, that would have me distrust their cognitive aptitudes.   but i'm not going to lie or hide the experience either, to coddle world views that assert it's not possible in mistaking absence of evidence for evidence of absence.
[12:55:44] <Digit> chatguy: you may not need to "take" drugs to understand that.  but drugs are playing their role in understanding (or, experiencing) that.
