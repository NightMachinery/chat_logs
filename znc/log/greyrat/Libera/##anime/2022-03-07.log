[08:21:40] <MootPoot> and I get distracted
[08:21:48] <Sapphirus> oh that's a terrible rationale. 
[08:21:56] <Sapphirus> You'll never learn anything that way
[08:22:12] <MootPoot> linux is shit enough in all the right ways in that it keeps me from enjoying using it for entertainment
[08:22:20] <MootPoot> so I can stay focused
[08:22:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hah, no
[08:22:44] <Sapphirus> ^^^^
[08:22:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You'll just figure out how to get it working Linux.
[08:22:50] <MootPoot> NO
[08:22:52] <MootPoot> I dont want that
[08:22:56] <MootPoot> then I'll get distracted
[08:22:58] <MootPoot> again
[08:22:59] <Sapphirus> Windows is shit
[08:23:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The key is to learn self-control. Not to put artifial and easily surmounted barriers.
[08:23:21] <Sapphirus> ^^
[08:23:32] <MootPoot> but learning how to self control is hard
[08:23:36] <MootPoot> :\
[08:23:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a lot more effective and worth-it long term.
[08:23:53] <Sapphirus> Using Linux because you can't control yourself is an admission that you don't intend on learning it for the right reasons.
[08:24:09] <MootPoot> what is the right reason
[08:24:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Abandoning a user-hostile proprietary OS that has given up on even pretending its users aren't a product for sale.
[08:24:45] <Sapphirus> ^^
[08:24:54] <MootPoot> oh, I dont really care about all of that
[08:25:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also improving user freedom & agency.
[08:25:28] <beaky> are there vtuber that use linux
[08:25:52] <beaky> so i can switch to the same distro that cute girls also use
[08:26:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If some bug annoys you with Microsoft, you can't just throw a 42$ at them to fix it. With Free Software you can. Though 42$ won't buy you much time unless it's just a push for something that was already annoying a lot of people anyway.
[08:26:17] <Sapphirus> Improving technical competency, being able to control your system and not the other way around, etc
[08:26:32] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: but that's the thing, nothing annoys me in microsoft
[08:26:34] <Sapphirus> and you can fix bugs yourself, too, if you want.
[08:26:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[08:26:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: How? Basically every UI change since Windows XP has annoyed me on it.
[08:27:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're bloated & resource-intensive.
[08:27:16] <MootPoot> I dont have a prehistoric computer?
[08:27:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The whole system itself is also incredibly resource-intensive and energy-unfriendly.
[08:27:27] <MootPoot> using 500mb extra ram is not even remotely a concern
[08:27:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Low unnecessary CPU-use leads to lower power use leads to savings.
[08:27:45] <Sapphirus> That doesn't matter. You don't have control over the resource-sucking nonsense that Microsoft forces on you without your consent.
[08:27:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lol 500mb, you're way too optimistic.
[08:28:09] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: sure...but it dosen't impair whatever I want to do for my use cases
[08:28:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Since Microsoft Windows 10, it swaps all the time.
[08:28:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It has become unusable with HDDs.
[08:28:27] <Sapphirus> yep
[08:28:28] <MootPoot> I dont run a HDD?
[08:28:35] <MootPoot> even on my linux systems I dont run a HDD
[08:28:37] <Sapphirus> Microsoft has made it increasingly difficult to disable their spyware, too, and it's completely intentional.
[08:28:38] <beaky> cant swap be disabled on windows too
[08:28:53] <MootPoot> there is no single system I own which runs its OS from a hdd
[08:28:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> beaky: That unfortunately has rather serious consequences on the system because it doesn't deal well with that.
[08:28:59] <Sapphirus> Forcing a browser down your throat you don't want, like Microsoft Edge.
[08:29:00] <beaky> gotta minimize the os's ram overhead so i can have more vtuber windows open
[08:29:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Unnecessary swapping leads to early SSD write amplification.
[08:29:30] <MootPoot> also, swap is afaik only a issue when you run out of ram
[08:29:31] <MootPoot> I dont

[08:29:32] <Sapphirus> I just don't run swap on my system and instead have a shitload of ram I don't need.
[08:29:36] <MootPoot> I have 64g in this system
[08:29:41] <MootPoot> :3
[08:29:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: No actually, it always swaps, regardless of no memory pressure.
[08:29:45] <Sapphirus> Windows unfortunately enables swap
[08:30:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And you can't change swappiness on Windows.
[08:30:08] <Sapphirus> At least you can just disable it on Linux.
[08:30:11] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: is that amount of writes enough to be relavent in a non amigo timeframe?
[08:30:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sapphirus: Or adjust it.
[08:30:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: If you go for cheap stuff? Yes.
[08:30:36] <Sapphirus> Unnecessary when you shove enough ram in a system.
[08:30:39] <MootPoot> they did nonstop writes to a old sata SSD for 5 years or something and it works fine
[08:30:44] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: fortunately I dont run cheap ssds
[08:31:05] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[08:31:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But anyway, the point is that both from a user rights, freedom & agency pov, and from a technology pov, Windows is a mess.
[08:31:26] <Sapphirus> It's actually hot garbage from a technological perspective.
[08:31:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They had a chance to improve and actually went the opposite way for most purposes.
[08:31:44] <Sapphirus> NTFS isn't even a proper journaling filesystem.
[08:31:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The only good things they did in the last decade were Powershell & WSL.
[08:31:50] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: how do you know that?
[08:31:54] <MootPoot> just wondering
[08:32:06] <MootPoot> what benchmarks have you seen, or do you have secret access to their code
[08:32:16] <klaxa> ntfs is not really secret
[08:32:27] <klaxa> maybe legally
[08:32:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Reverse-engineering isn't that hard.
[08:32:39] <Sapphirus> and the source code has been leaked several times
[08:32:43] <beaky> secret like the identity of vtuber
[08:32:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[08:32:46] <ButterNoodle> Powershell & WSL <- woah if that's an accomplishment...
[08:32:53] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: sure, but I'm just asking him - has he dug into it and checked? 
[08:33:03] <MootPoot> or is he just spewing unverified shit
[08:33:28] <ButterNoodle> what has journaling done for anyone anyway?
[08:33:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Proper object pipes are disappointingly rare in shell languages. And WSL requires little explanation beyond expanding the acronym.
[08:33:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Prevented rampant data corruption on power outages.

[08:34:01] <ButterNoodle> *it help, does not prevent
[08:34:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: If you use full-journaling with ext4, it prevents entirely.

[08:47:16] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, my comment on 2 is that you just have no fucking idea what the hell you're doing
[08:47:23] <MootPoot> its called efficiency 
[08:47:23] <Sapphirus> and no 1 is solved with steamplay
[08:47:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I kinda wish they sold cheap recomposed-meat from crickets or whatever.
[08:47:39] <MootPoot> so no 1 is solved by relying on a windows computer?
[08:47:43] <klaxa> no it's called being gross and having no conscience, but that's a valid choice
[08:48:02] <MootPoot> and for 2, sure - I get it, but I had no idea what I was doing when I started out with windows 98 either
[08:48:08] <Sapphirus> klaxa, that's a great analogy.

[08:50:07] <ButterNoodle> yea
[08:50:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Depends. Can you declare functions dynamically at runtime like you can in Lisp, or are they predeclared and simply assembly jumppoints?

[08:50:47] <Sapphirus> klaxa, furthermore on that point, the solution that you'll always inevitably come up with is to reinstall Windows.

[09:00:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So yeah, before Valve decided to bet on Linux & massively invest in upstreaming patches & work on Proton... indeed, Linux lagged significantly behind.
[09:00:08] <ButterNoodle> just because someone isnt implementing something with ur exact use case doesnt meant they are doing something wrong or that they are stupid
[09:00:12] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: what sarcasm

[09:00:58] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: tbh I'm really hyped for all of that - afaik the compatibility is still iffy but maybe by 2025 when win10 switches to no support it'll be good enough to hop over to for my applications

[09:06:20] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, like I said, that's an admittedly bad descriptor. I think a better word would be flippant.

[09:28:26] <Sapphirus> Your attitude is what I was responding to and I held myself to the best of my ability to carefully tread the line.
[09:29:14] <MootPoot> That minor of a thing, not even against you or anyone for that matter - was enough for you to want to "unload and hurl verbal shit at you"
[09:29:14] <Sapphirus> In other words, what I'm attempting to say, is that you can drive someone mad with your flippant attitude towards things.
[09:30:17] <Sapphirus> I'm being dramatic to try and get the point across.
[09:30:22] <MootPoot> Its up to you to learn to exercise restraint and accept other peoples choices...especially ones that don't effect you in the slightest. 
[09:30:38] <Sapphirus> It's not as minor of a thing as you think it is.
[09:31:07] <MootPoot> Even if its major, if it does not effect you, then what's the issue?
[09:31:18] <Sapphirus> Again, this isn't about your choices, so much as it is about your attitude towards making said choices.
[09:31:44] <Sapphirus> I have no problem with someone making their own choice alone.
[09:32:00] <MootPoot> Sure, same thing applies - why is it an issue to you about what attitudes I have towards things that don't effect anyone else?
[09:32:05] <Fenderbassist> I wish you all a good night

[09:32:54] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, that's the neat thing, your attitude governs how you carry yourself towards others.
[09:33:29] <Sapphirus> You may not see it, for what it's worth, but that doesn't mean it isn't having an affect on how other's perceive you and your words.
[09:34:14] <MootPoot> You can perceive me and my attitudes however you want - but how did that translate into justification for insulting me?
[09:34:47] *** Joins: J3715 (~IceChat95@exira-01-23-57.dialup.netins.net)
[09:34:54] <MootPoot> Again, the issue is why you felt like you had any reason to insult me unprovoked, not what you thought of my attitudes
[09:35:31] <Sapphirus> You seem to be completely missing the point. I've admitted what I did and why I did it.
[09:36:06] <MootPoot> I know your point is my attitude has had an effect on you, I don't contest that
[09:36:12] <Sapphirus> What I'll leave it at is this: You could at least admit you need a bit of an attitude adjustment.
[09:36:46] <MootPoot> what I'm asking is how that translates to you finding it okay to insulting me, and now - telling me I need an attitude adjustment.
[09:37:18] <Sapphirus> Well, you do. 
[09:37:46] <MootPoot> Why? Did I ask for it? Is it harming anyone?
[09:38:11] <Sapphirus> This is one of those circumstances wherein I think a veiled insult was appropriate given the context of your attitude. 
[09:38:14] <MootPoot> Did I pay you to grade my attitude?

[09:39:50] <Sapphirus> Like I said, your attitude does have an effect on others around you.
[09:40:16] <MootPoot> In short - you're just admitting that you lack the self restraint to be unaffected by a different person's attitude to a thing which has nothing to do with you.
[09:40:26] <Sapphirus> no, not at all.
[09:40:50] <MootPoot> You yourself said my attitude had an effect on you.
[09:40:53] <Sapphirus> You seem to be under the impression that your attitude doesn't actually have anything to do with anyone else and doesn't in any way affect one's perception of you and what you say.

[09:47:10] <Sapphirus> > different person's attitude to a thing which has nothing to do with you. < MootPoot, then you wouldn't be saying this contradictory thing if that were actually true.
[09:47:28] <MootPoot> By nothing to do with you I mean in a logical sense, not emotional or mental
[09:47:52] <Sapphirus> Are we supposed to be, what, robots?
[09:48:08] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: an adult..with self control.
[09:48:13] <MootPoot> enough of it.
[09:48:21] <Sapphirus> Your attitude has an effect on others and how they perceive you and what you say. That's where I'll leave it, since that point doesn't seem to sink in.
[09:48:37] <MootPoot> I just confirmed your point above, but you seem to be ignoring mine
[09:49:01] <MootPoot> just like you ignored when I repeated where I understand and dont contest your point twice now.
[09:49:43] <Sapphirus> And say something contradictory to that, a few minutes earlier.
[09:49:47] <Sapphirus> Why do you think I'm ignoring it?
[09:49:56] <MootPoot> >since that point doesn't seem to sink in.
[09:50:11] <MootPoot> I accepted your point, but you act like I'm not.
[09:51:04] <MootPoot> When I say it has nothing to do with you - as I clarified above, it means directly. I didn't do anything towards you. Its up to you to control your mental state, not me.
[09:51:54] <Sapphirus> And I am in control of it. I decided it was appropriate to call you out.
[09:51:55] <MootPoot> If you can't stay on IRC without getting annoyed and insulting somebody else on their attitude about a thing which you may FEEL things about, but not actually are harmed by it..I think you need to stay offline.
[09:52:40] <Sapphirus> See, this is why when you say you agree with my point, you fundamentally are full of it. You are making this about me and you honestly don't seem to understand that your attitude can affect how others perceive you.
[09:53:14] <MootPoot> I get it, I'm just wondering what happened in your mental logic tree where you "decided it was appropriate to call you out"
[09:53:31] <Sapphirus> There are consequences to how one conducts themselves.
[09:53:34] <MootPoot> There is a difference from being effected by 
[09:53:42] <MootPoot> something and responding to it in a certain manner
[09:53:46] <MootPoot> my issue with with the response
[09:54:34] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: so in short,  you just think its justified to insult someone over what their attitudes may be, that is classified as an acceptable response to you.
[09:54:42] <Sapphirus> Others here may just wanted to stay sober and not engage with you on it.
[09:54:46] <MootPoot> That's just the end all of it.
[09:55:03] <MootPoot> you just think its okay to insult people on their attitudes.
[09:55:07] <MootPoot> Good to know.
[09:56:27] <Sapphirus> MootPoot "To insult someone." No, let's be real clear here. I never directly insulted you.

[09:57:25] <Sapphirus> You may have been insulted, but that's an entirely different thing.
[09:57:39] <Sapphirus> A veiled insult is probably as far as I will admit you can stretch it. But a direct insult? No, that's you trying to claim it to be something it's not.
[09:57:49] <MootPoot> >stretch it
[09:57:55] <MootPoot> not this again, you admitted that is what it was
[09:58:31] <Sapphirus> Yes and I did there, too, it was a veiled insult. There's a difference between that and a direct insult.
[09:58:49] <MootPoot> Its like trying to claim its not a direct insult but there is only one possible person you could have been possibly referencing.
[09:58:55] <MootPoot> Unless there was somebody else
[09:58:58] <MootPoot> in which case tell me

[10:04:38] <MootPoot> its like saying you threw 1 day old poo at me instead of fresh poo
[10:05:28] <Sapphirus> Fact you think it means nothing goes to show how black&white you perceive this whole thing to be.
[10:05:30] <MootPoot> so this entire sidequest - veiled or not, makes no difference
[10:05:49] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: course I do. You insulted me. You shouldn't have. That's all there is to it.
[10:05:53] <MootPoot> There is no nuance here.
[10:05:54] <Sapphirus> There's no 20, 25, 40, it's just 0 or 100 with you.
[10:06:10] <Sapphirus> Or better analogy would be just a 1 and a 0.
[10:06:26] <MootPoot> trying to use 20,25,40 as a kind of way to minimize your error is just pussyfooting
[10:07:00] <Sapphirus> Not really. You have no nuance and it shows. You yourself admitted that you aren't approaching this with any nuance and really don't care about how others perceive your attitude.
[10:07:01] <MootPoot> "Mom I failed my exam by only 1 point instead of 15!"...you still fucking failed.
[10:07:07] <Sapphirus> Even if you pretend to concede that point, it's obvious that you don't really care.
[10:07:21] <Sapphirus> And it's exactly why I didn't care when I threw that veiled insult at you.
[10:07:27] <MootPoot> I dont care..because caring about it does nothing.
[10:07:41] <MootPoot> I recognize it, but I dont care. What would caring do?
[10:07:50] <Sapphirus> Exactly, so what right do you have to be on such a high horse towards me such as you have been?
[10:07:54] <MootPoot> Tell me, what benefits in this situation from having this nuance?
[10:08:03] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: You insulted me, I did not insult you. 
[10:08:04] <MootPoot> Thats it
[10:08:14] <MootPoot> That's my high horse that only gets higher
[10:08:44] <Sapphirus> See, black&white. You don't even want to try and understand why your attitude is as toxic as it is.
[10:08:57] <Sapphirus> You'd rather just say "He insulted me!@!@!@!@" and disregard everything else.
[10:08:59] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I like how this is back about my attitude again - ignoring the problem
[10:09:04] <MootPoot> >You'd rather just say "He insulted me!@!@!@!@" and disregard everything else.
[10:09:08] <MootPoot> Because that IS the problem
[10:09:14] <MootPoot> I dont give a fuck about your mental state
[10:09:18] <MootPoot> that's your responsibility
[10:09:23] <Sapphirus> You seem to be misunderstanding that it's a symptom of a problem with your attitude.
[10:09:30] <Sapphirus> My mental state has nothing to do with this.
[10:09:43] <MootPoot> Your mental state caused you to insult me
[10:09:44] <Sapphirus> You wish to shift the blame towards it, but that really isn't going to work with me.
[10:10:39] <MootPoot> The only problem here is that you insulted me. My mental state or yours , while they can be related, is not the problem. 
[10:11:01] <Sapphirus> rofl -- so there's nothing wrong with your attitude? Nice.
[10:11:18] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: my attitude didn't make me insult somebody else..yours did
[10:11:24] <MootPoot> my attitude didn't make me insult somebody else..yours did
[10:11:27] <DaPinkOne> Sapphirus, you're not being very clear yourself.
[10:11:31] <Sapphirus> You just admitted that you never agreed to my point to begin with and it has to do with your inability to understand the nuance of the situation.
[10:11:39] <Sapphirus> 🤣
[10:11:52] <MootPoot> your point is a distraction from the problem.
[10:12:21] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, how long have you been at this?
[10:12:34] <MootPoot> DaPinkOne: a while/
[10:12:40] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, it's not a distraction. Your attitude is a problem and it does need adjustment.

[10:12:47] <ButterNoodle> its pretty good tbh
[10:13:02] <Sapphirus> Best adjective to describe it would be childish, because the best argument you have is "Daddy, he called me a name!"

[10:15:11] <DaPinkOne> like ya do, I suppose
[10:15:44] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, so? I'm not going to apologise for the veiled insult. I do think it was warranted at the time.

[10:17:48] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, I've been controlling myself this entire time, that's the thing. I allowed myself to slip on purpose for a reason.

[10:56:16] <Sapphirus> Bco1981, what CPU are you using?
[10:56:21] <Bco1981> 5800x
[10:56:56] <Bco1981> thermal limited to 80C... otherwise this cpu will try to cook it self.
[10:57:58] <Sapphirus> Are thermals not allowing for you to sustain a high enough clock speed?
[10:58:35] <Bco1981> nope, it boost fine. just taking the top off of the boost. but it keeps it fine.
[10:58:56] <Sapphirus> At what clock frequency?
[10:59:03] <Bco1981> so it only boosts to like 4.6ghz, and not 4.75ghz
[10:59:14] <Sapphirus> Does it hold at 4.6ghz?
[10:59:16] <Bco1981> yes
[11:00:06] <Bco1981> it's a thermal limit, not a thermal throttle.
[11:00:45] <Sapphirus> Yeah, the K6-III is too heavy for my machine.

[11:11:37] <Sapphirus> Voodoo emulation has received most of the attention, it seems
[11:12:07] <Sapphirus> There are rough edges here and there, but it's very good for what it presently is able to do.
[11:12:51] <Sapphirus> I'd imagine this type of emulation is far more difficult to do than console emulation.
[11:12:55] <Bco1981> yeah, i guess the best will always be to go with the real hardware.
[11:13:20] <Sapphirus> I'm looking forward to maybe a time when emulation reaches a closer parity.

[11:22:13] <Sapphirus> This emulator will serve me fine. So far I've played some Puyo Puyo SUn.

[11:22:34] <Sapphirus> Like, I don't imagine you need all of that to play old PC games.
[11:22:58] <Sapphirus> You've probably got one or two systems that do all the heavy lifting.
[11:23:00] <Bco1981> nope. just a handfull of machines and some spare parts.
[11:23:31] <mixfix41> you can run handbrake on em if you have rom drives
[11:23:44] <mixfix41> if they are compact though..

[11:29:04] <Bco1981> i did a k6-2 300
[11:29:10] <Sapphirus> Does it run at 100%?
[11:29:25] <Bco1981> it also goes way up on 1 core yes.
[11:30:41] <Bco1981> i'm on windows, the task manager doesn't report 100% on one core. but % of total threads and it was around 8-11% use when running.

[11:31:39] <Sapphirus> K6-II/233 is the maximum you can reasonably push it with high-end host hardware, I think.

[11:35:59] <Sapphirus> Oh, that is unfortunate. We never had any such restrictions here.
[11:36:06] <amigojapan> 7 11 is one of the last places that does not check for fever

[11:36:56] <amigojapan> we never had that

[11:43:47] <Sapphirus> One of those things that appears to be a "We hope it does something," type of deal.
[11:43:57] <Sapphirus> They dropped the passports and aren't requiring anyone to get boosters here.
[11:44:08] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I am not sure, unlike other countries people hardly got corona at all on ht efitst few waves, so omicron owuld be hteir first exposure, and deaths have gone up since omicron in Japan
[11:44:29] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: maybe its just that your weak people died off before htey got omicron
[11:44:37] <amigojapan> not that it is mild

[12:05:00] <mixfix41> Sapphirus: theres bigger issues, like death to focus rather lets be clear
[12:05:02] <Sapphirus> mixfix41, incidence rate for Moderna alone was 1 in 5,000 at the time of that article being published.
[12:05:06] * MootPoot is on the toilet right now 
[12:05:11] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: tasty
[12:05:12] <mixfix41> let your mind fly away on that one
[12:05:13] <MootPoot> I guess I'll be shitting all night 
[12:05:27] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: it was extra milky coffee too 
[12:06:20] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: expect anal creamery
[12:07:27] <mixfix41> Sapphirus: if you are apt to talk about it... what are your personal experiences?
[12:07:47] <MootPoot> I wonder what the alternative covid vaccines are up to 
[12:07:53] <Sapphirus> I was sick with COVID and dealt with long haul for nearly two years
[12:07:57] <mixfix41> you have weird opinions . what about your siblings and parents these issues you always talk about are obstacles here too?
[12:08:01] <MootPoot> I heard there was gonna be a nasal covid vaccine 
[12:08:06] <MootPoot> Spray up the nose 
[12:08:18] <MootPoot> Wonder if they can make a pill
[12:08:56] <mixfix41> except you are on the opposite spectrum of prevention? "get out of here" in my best italian accent
[12:09:29] <DunceCotus> sikh with covid
[12:09:53] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: lol
[12:10:02] <Sapphirus> Everyone is eventually going to get it at one point or another with how transmissible omicron is.
[12:10:12] <MootPoot> not me
[12:10:20] <Sapphirus> Preventing transmission is unrealistic at this point
[12:10:22] <MootPoot> I'm extremely good at isolating
[12:10:30] <DunceCotus> I've heard of people getting covid without being exposed to anyone
[12:10:31] <MootPoot> professional hikkiNEET
[12:10:53] <DunceCotus> seems like our understanding of virus transmission isn't that sophisticated
[12:11:03] <Sapphirus> Duncecotus, I didn't encounter anyone symptomatic before I got deathly ill with it
[12:11:27] <Sapphirus> I'm still not sure where I got it from.
[12:11:28] *** Joins: Iolo (~iolo@user/Iolo)
[12:11:36] <DunceCotus> imo covid is more due to environmental changes
[12:11:46] <DunceCotus> our bodies produce the viruses
[12:11:55] <DunceCotus> in response to environment changes
[12:12:02] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: is it made in ur balls
[12:12:15] <MootPoot> cum it out
[12:12:22] <MootPoot> or get a cute girl to squeeze it out
[12:12:47] <Sapphirus> Running theory is that it's from family I had seen a few weeks prior
[12:12:53] <Sapphirus> but it's still just a theory
[12:12:59] <MootPoot> dont incest
[12:13:04] <Sapphirus> and that's all it will be
[12:13:14] <MootPoot> unless you have a cute japanese sister
[12:13:16] <MootPoot> in which case
[12:13:18] <MootPoot> go for it
[12:13:33] <DunceCotus> cum out covid for cancer research
[12:13:37] <MootPoot> yes
[12:14:01] <mixfix41> i mean the a guy lost his partner to the j&j vaccine still advocate for the use of it
[12:14:22] <MootPoot> I got 2x moderna and 1x pfizer
[12:14:29] <mixfix41> its not like you have your wife in an urn and saying its too late
[12:14:39] <MootPoot> also, whoever the fuck named a company pfizer with a silent p was an idiot
[12:14:50] <MootPoot> just call it fizer
[12:14:59] <MootPoot> silent letters in general are idiodic
[12:16:12] <Sapphirus> mixfix41, the vaccine was on the market long after I initially got sick with it.
[12:16:50] <Sapphirus> And there was no point introducing an unknown variable when i was dealing with weird long-hauler symptoms.
[12:16:54] <MootPoot> some grampa was telling me all about some kind of antibody treatment
[12:16:59] <MootPoot> some short term shot you can get
[12:17:07] <MootPoot> for ~2 weeks of immunity
[12:17:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I watched a little bit of Gordeon Ramsey, I want to hearm him say something like "This food is like a llama puked on the dish"
[12:17:19] <MootPoot> but only in the US
[12:17:23] <MootPoot> amigojapan: lol
[12:17:45] <DunceCotus> how are people just discovering Ramsay now
[12:17:51] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: they aren't
[12:17:54] <MootPoot> its just amigo 
[12:17:58] <DunceCotus> been doing his same schtick for 50 years
[12:18:03] <MootPoot> amigo has his own time system
[12:18:07] <Sapphirus> Pretty sure I have sufficient antibodies from the initial infection given I've been in contact with COVID positive people to no detriment.

[13:03:55] <DunceCotus> as such the system is one of diminishing returns 
[13:04:09] <mixfix41> okay i think i do agree thing. more incline with the inequality in the system than technology/privacy/education issues..
[13:04:12] <DunceCotus> slight upgrades but mostly new products don't upset this delicate 'balance'
[13:04:46] <mixfix41> i think its the inequality thats worth mentioning why it doesnt work

[13:20:37] <mixfix41> DunceCotus: its sound fat fetch'd tho like the pokemon. if the problems of the world is criticising this capatlism for , distributing tech. is missing the point. the inequality of those who can buy and own is the problem. and scale it to everyone on the planet same with food. and shelter plain and simple. the problem is not putting all the power into the chance the chance we had it. now we gotta wait 
[13:20:43] <mixfix41> till the chance comes again. and that wait might be awhile
[13:21:48] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: power does not wait
[13:21:57] <mixfix41> yea but chances do occur

[13:22:15] <mixfix41> well thats a symptom of what can go wrong
[13:22:48] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: the inequality is produced

[13:24:40] <DunceCotus> it is better for small-scale societies
[13:25:10] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: people only do this because of capitalism though

[13:26:05] <mixfix41> its one person making these decisions. they have a disease mindset
[13:26:21] <mixfix41> its not some governing / economic entity
[13:26:21] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: its not individualisable
[13:26:25] <mixfix41> yes it is
[13:26:28] <mixfix41> rca was
[13:26:30] <DunceCotus> no it really isn't
[13:26:36] <mixfix41> yes
[13:26:43] <mixfix41> you can name names in this example
[13:27:02] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: you blame certain people and new people emerge doing the same thing, but more clandestine
[13:27:10] <mixfix41> same thing is an assumption
[13:27:12] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: that's the systemic spect
[13:27:36] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: the point is people only have this diseased mindset cause that's how to get 'ahead'
[13:27:39] <mixfix41> what really happen was one person who want to make a profit for the company so yes its the company direction that did it
[13:27:42] <DunceCotus> within this system
[13:28:02] <DunceCotus> this isn't a moral issue
[13:28:09] <mixfix41> hence their skew perception of what they believe to be the best to surpress better tech
[13:28:12] <DunceCotus> this is an ethico-ontological issue

[13:29:59] <DunceCotus> well the way our bodies work is also tied to capitalism

[13:30:28] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: a socius is more than just a social formation
[13:30:48] <DunceCotus> it is the real production of reality
[13:31:07] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: our nature is a capitalist one
[13:31:14] <mixfix41> they say an image is a thousand words and this conversation really makes me think about this
[13:31:54] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: a true revolution is thus not simply on the level of social organisation
[13:32:03] <DunceCotus> it is on the level of reality itself
[13:32:35] <mixfix41> like in ghost hunters?
[13:33:01] <DunceCotus> ghosts are perhaps the result of a narrowing of the band of experience
[13:33:17] <mixfix41> well.. you see i hate tests. but that question could be one
[13:33:19] <DunceCotus> capitalism must excise everything it cannot readily subsume
[13:33:39] <mixfix41> ghosts hunters are just hi tech gizmo groups liking to hang out and socialize not even high tech geeks but a mixture

[14:02:24] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: however it also re-territorialises spaces back into the regime of capital accumulation
[14:02:57] <DunceCotus> apathy is a big problem yes
[14:03:08] <DunceCotus> because its generally not a pure apathy
[14:03:19] <DunceCotus> its rather a falling back on, or resignation to, capitalism
[14:03:32] <mixfix41> the problem with my stance in itself is everything become far fetch'd. you really gotta be in the shoes in the person who knows. or have better views in your own shoes i guess.
[14:04:36] <DunceCotus> I think we gotta get new shoes
[14:05:02] <DunceCotus> these mouldy decrepit trainers have served us for a time but are now falling apart, getting our feet injured etc
[14:05:06] <mixfix41> now i recommend for you is you have to better get concrete hypothesis to start. cause then allocating time since time is a resource it could start 
[14:05:36] <DunceCotus> 'time is a resource' - this is what I was talking about above
[14:05:48] <DunceCotus> this is onto-commodification

[14:21:01] <DunceCotus> mixfix41: I want to understand
[14:21:44] <mixfix41> ok. but your missing the bigger picture. you continue to chatter. we can freeze the conversation here. learn from it. or if you want to add a few more sources go ahead. but i said my obstacle to what you start this whole thing on to begin with tonight. im not sure. i can link you it but i dont really want to for the sake of it to be honest
[14:22:26] <DunceCotus> you seem adamant in disagreeing with me
[14:22:39] <DunceCotus> but I do not understand your words enough to get your disagreement
[14:22:41] <mixfix41> i can tell you once you decipher my source i gave you,,, its much much more entertain leisure read then the '
[14:22:48] <mixfix41> broad marxist topics you gave me
[14:23:17] <Sapphirus> I have no idea what's even going on. Skimming the conversation left me even more clueless.
[14:23:31] <DunceCotus> well entertaining does not always mean philosophically interesting
[14:23:46] <mixfix41> theres no point in conversing if i cant get my message accross its inconpatible for us to talk to each other
[14:23:58] <mixfix41> why throw more points into it rather than leaving it where it stands
[14:24:08] <mixfix41> and exercise patience
[14:24:16] <mixfix41> i mean i thought i was doing you a favor
[14:24:26] <DunceCotus> I guess at the end of the day I will continue with or without you
[14:24:53] <mixfix41> ok but still. sure 100% failure our system we must change
[14:25:13] <DunceCotus> well glad we can agree on that point at least
[14:25:25] <mixfix41> no but thats the basis of what you refuse to read from someone you lecture
[14:25:45] <mixfix41> i give responses yet you go on about it.. not very concrete to what i told you
[14:25:57] <DunceCotus> like if your point is its not fully the system but certain individuals, well I disagree
[14:26:20] <DunceCotus> this isn't a problem of individual morality
[14:26:28] <mixfix41> well i dont know you dont provide a good boat theory
[14:26:48] <Sapphirus> General problem with marxism is that for it to work you'd need to rewrite human nature.
[14:26:52] <mixfix41> feels like im sinking in deep water there
[14:26:58] <Sapphirus> Which means, it is fundamentally incompatible with the natural order of things.
[14:27:07] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: there is no fixed human nature
[14:27:13] <Sapphirus> that's a load of shit.
[14:27:17] <DunceCotus> nature is bundled up with culture
[14:27:22] <DunceCotus> we have a capitalistic nature right now
[14:27:23] <Sapphirus> ugh
[14:27:32] <DunceCotus> that's a contemporaneous formation
[14:27:45] <mixfix41> also i think you have to get back to basics
[14:27:50] <DunceCotus> so of course in any socius you can say it fits our nature
[14:27:53] <mixfix41> this is flaw logic you converse
[14:27:53] <DunceCotus> but that's kinda cheating
[14:28:16] <Sapphirus> mixfix41, enjoy. I dont' want to go in circles for hours again tonight
[14:28:21] <Sapphirus> He's all yours. :P

[23:21:28] <TsundereNoises> sorry I'm just caught up on the absurdity of "everyone is a sociopath"
[23:21:34] <TsundereNoises> cause that'd make it a meaningless word
[23:21:49] <JesseDesu> i didnt really mean that
[23:21:56] <JesseDesu> i cant back it up with logic
[23:22:00] <TsundereNoises> I know
[23:22:06] <TsundereNoises> It kind of amused me in a weird way
[23:22:49] <JesseDesu> there are some super intelligent people
[23:22:53] <JesseDesu> with youtube channels
[23:22:53] <Satin> ssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
[23:22:55] <Satin> hisss
[23:23:10] <JesseDesu> that seem hell bent on making as much money and getting as much subscribers as possible
[23:24:06] <JesseDesu> i need to clean up
[23:24:15] <TsundereNoises> I feel like having a youtube channel is almost the opposite of a sign that someone is really smart
[23:24:20] <JesseDesu> theres a cat5 cable just laying on top of my keyboard
[23:24:38] <TsundereNoises> I have a sudden need of a longer cat5 cable
[23:24:58] <TsundereNoises> I want to put my router somewhere else, but I don't have a long enough cable to reach
[23:24:59] <JesseDesu> and bowls of eaten macaroni plates
[23:25:10] <JesseDesu> frozen dinner trays
[23:25:19] <JesseDesu> ugh
[23:25:24] <JesseDesu> wanna see a picture of my mess
[23:26:19] <JesseDesu> i need an accountability partner
[23:26:37] <JesseDesu> kinda like with satin's pomodoro clubs
[23:26:49] <TsundereNoises> send me a picture of your disgusting mess, but I'm not committing to a greater commitment
[23:26:53] <Satin> i just said

[23:30:02] <TsundereNoises> ah, I see Satin is an S
[23:30:05] <Satin> JesseDesu: that's like nothing

[23:30:20] <teus> Ducati, an Italian brand name in the bicycle industry, has unveiled their new line of e-bikes: the Futa, and the name naturally spurred nonstop ribbing on social media, as the name resembles a fetish involving a female with both sets of genitals (futanari).
[23:30:39] <JesseDesu> ducati futa
[23:30:53] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: It's not really that bad but we can shame you if you want
[23:31:07] <JesseDesu> i mean
[23:31:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: hey, I'm not the one with a bunch of submission-related macros
[23:31:11] <JesseDesu> i know how to clean it up
[23:31:22] <TsundereNoises> I like that madoka
[23:31:26] <JesseDesu> TsundereNoises, i drew that
[23:31:27] <TsundereNoises> or whoever it is
[23:31:34] <JesseDesu> yes ur right
[23:31:35] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I assumed you did
[23:31:37] <JesseDesu> madoka
[23:31:46] <Satin> 📎welc 
[23:31:46] <TsundereNoises> it'd be weird for an artist like you ta hove some other person's sketches up
[23:32:01] <JesseDesu> she's bending backwards while stretching a bow
[23:32:22] <TsundereNoises> I mean, there are too many plates, also I feel like it's kind of a weird room in terms of vertical space usage
[23:32:37] <TsundereNoises> I don't know, I'm just jealous because I don't have room for as much shelf space as I want in my office room
[23:32:56] <TsundereNoises> but these aren't some terrible personal failings
[23:33:14] <JesseDesu> too many plates is correct
[23:33:43] <JesseDesu> i got fucking unfridgerated ketchup bottle 
[23:33:58] <JesseDesu> it doesnt taste like its going bad
[23:34:13] <JesseDesu> tastes exactly like room temperature ketchup
[23:36:09] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: you really don't need to fridge ketchup, you're fine
[23:36:30] <TsundereNoises> it's basically already preserved, bacteria don't like it
[23:36:38] <teus> lol murricans
[23:36:49] <teus> they'd toss anything left out of the fridge for 5 minutes
[23:37:12] <JesseDesu> uh not really
[23:37:23] <teus> quite rly
[23:37:25] <JesseDesu> i eat shit thats been out for 5 hours
[23:37:31] <JesseDesu> 6 is pushing it
[23:37:32] <teus> kethcup and mayonaise are too acidic to need refridgreation
[23:37:40] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: you shouldn't eat shit
[23:37:46] <JesseDesu> lol 
[23:37:51] <JesseDesu> i should reword
[23:37:51] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: shit DOES tend to have a lot of bacteria in it
[23:38:05] <JesseDesu> i eat food that should be cold/hot thats been out for 5 hours
[23:38:07] <MootPoot> satin is an M?
[23:38:09] <MootPoot> sounds about right
[23:38:21] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: she has a folder of chat macros related to submission
[23:38:29] <MootPoot> mmhmm
[23:38:44] <MootPoot> I got those subby vibes from her all these years

[23:45:01] <JesseDesu> wtf
[23:45:03] <Satin> ezekielnoob: 
[23:45:12] <JesseDesu> was it 12
[23:45:15] <JesseDesu> i had no idea
[23:45:23] <Satin> davic: time to change plans for you
[23:46:13] <ezekielnoob> yes it was 12
[23:46:23] <ezekielnoob> jesus, finally got that updated atleast
[23:46:56] <MootPoot> Afaik actual marriages at 12 or so are super rare 
[23:47:07] <MootPoot> Just updating old laws
[23:47:13] <MootPoot> Now make incest legal
[23:47:14] <TsundereNoises> Satin: do they even have kpop idols in the philippines? davic will probably be better off elsewhere anyway
[23:47:34] <JesseDesu> they have an akb48 branch
[23:47:41] <JesseDesu> i think its called mnl48
[23:47:42] <ezekielnoob> KPOP is ultra popular here
[23:48:06] <Satin> TsundereNoises: davic's future wife is from PH tho
[23:48:09] <TsundereNoises> I mean for davic to marry a kpop idol though, wouldn't he be better off in korea
[23:48:17] <Satin> and he's moving there at some point im p sure
[23:48:39] <TsundereNoises> I didn't know he actually had someone, but I've been barely around the last couple months and really year
[23:48:55] <Satin> eh i mean he doesn't talk about it that much
[23:49:03] <Satin> p sure this is the case for 2+ years now
[23:49:12] <TsundereNoises> I need to pay more attention so I can mock the ops better
[23:49:34] <TsundereNoises> I know he's been talking about moving for a long time
[23:49:39] <TsundereNoises> just didn't realize the relationship
[23:49:50] <TsundereNoises> or forgot
