[05:27:13] <gwern> they *murdered a hostage* and they got such a slap on the wrist WP doesn't even mention what the 'short sentences' were?
[05:27:43] <PlanckWalk> They sentenced themselves to Cuba, I guess that was "time served"? :-p

[05:28:54] <gwern> not like moscow
[05:28:59] <kuudes> over here the convoy splintered and pivoted to gasoline price protest
[05:29:27] <kuudes> you know, because we have rather few things that are mandatory re random people re covid

[05:30:35] <kuudes> ?
[05:31:20] <kuudes> we don't have vaccine mandate unless sort of if you work in healthcare; we don't have a mask mandate anywhere I think
[05:31:40] <kuudes> your employer can't ask of your vaccination status unless stated so by law
[05:32:00] <adiabatic> Canada's way more authoritarian than Finland on this, then.
[05:32:09] <kuudes> currently even covid passport requirement option is not enabled
[05:32:12] <PlanckWalk> Australia, too
[05:32:25] <kuudes> well, we still had convoy, because it comes from abroad
[05:32:26] <adiabatic> yeah, Australia is going back to its roots as a prison colony
[05:32:39] <adiabatic> Sad!
[05:32:42] <kuudes> it does not make sense nor is locally started
[05:33:00] <kuudes> but seems to be quite directly foreign influence, likely russian attack on society before ukraine war
[05:33:03] <adiabatic> kuudes: sounds like the BLM protests you had a couple years back
[05:33:35] <kuudes> yeah, though that was sort of one off
[05:33:41] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes the rules here make no sense, but that's really no different from any other rules forever.
[05:34:22] <kuudes> there have been protests by musicians because events have been banned
[05:35:18] <kuudes> but even schools were not mandatorily closed at any point, you were allowed to take your kid to school or daycare at all times
[05:35:42] <adiabatic> Was attendance still mandatory?
[05:35:44] <PlanckWalk> The school situation here has been bizarre
[05:35:54] <PlanckWalk> (and still is)
[05:36:12] <kuudes> adiabatic, sort of. but remote school was the default in spring 2020 when about everyone self isolated to their homes
[05:36:28] <kuudes> you could go to grab the school meals from schools to homes though
[05:36:40] <adiabatic> that sounds like what I remember
[05:37:06] <kuudes> but you didn't have to isolate, you could still attend near-school if you felt you needed that
[05:38:39] <kuudes> I guess gyms made the biggest fuss about forced closures; restaurants are used to there being liquer licence and hygiene licence, so there are rules and you have to accept them before you start a restaurant
[05:38:50] <kuudes> their business lobby has been very deathist though
[05:39:03] <kuudes> even to the extent of voicing "old people die in any case" etc
[05:40:35] <kuudes> and I guess sportspeople have been angry as sports has been limited basicly in its fundraising
[05:41:13] <kuudes> ie audience seats and organized indoor youth sports training
[05:42:33] <kuudes> but still convoy was had, and it had theme of "against covid measures", which was odd
[05:43:04] <kuudes> "down with covid passport" but the passport had been disabled already in december because omicron made it moot
[05:43:44] <adiabatic> and I thought you all's BLM protests were the weirdest meme to blow through
[05:43:48] <kuudes> "down with vaccinations!" they are not mandatory, and we can't currently even check from health data who has not got vaccine to contact them
[05:44:14] <adiabatic> nope, shit got weirder
[05:44:38] * gwern is still amused at the idea of european BLM protests at all. all these people protesting who haven't met an african-american in their lives
[05:45:45] <PlanckWalk> I think they generally spread as "ethnic minority lives matter", only without renaming.
[05:45:59] <kuudes> no
[05:46:08] <PlanckWalk> The ones here were more about aboriginal deaths in custody, for example.
[05:46:14] <kuudes> I don't recall any talk about sami or romani people re blm locally
[05:46:49] <PlanckWalk> Certainly not much about any ethnic groups from Africa (except to the extent that we're all from Africa)
[05:46:50] <kuudes> they seemed mainly to be related to people who are related to people who have migrated to here from africa
[05:47:37] <PlanckWalk> Okay
[05:48:03] <saturn2> they wanted biden
[05:50:03] <PlanckWalk> Well, ethnic minorities with darker skin.
[05:50:56] <PlanckWalk> (Which is a weird thing to consider internationally, but eh whatever)
[05:51:53] <adiabatic> they're not doing much considering. they're blindly copying US Southeast race relations and grafting them onto local conditions with varying degrees of success
[05:52:36] <kuudes> I guess this is the good situation? at least the artificial memes are relatively easy to identify over here because they are just out of touch with anything?
[05:52:43] <adiabatic> and, like, the three rules of sociology are (1) everything matters a little (2) nothing matters a lot (3) everything's different in the South
[05:52:52] <PlanckWalk> Seems that way yes
[05:53:56] <adiabatic> and yet the entire fucking country is trying to apply Southern racial dynamics to, like, countries that are 30% white, 30% asian, 30% south asian, and the last 10% for everything else
[05:54:24] <adiabatic> this is what bothers me about Canadians — they're not doing their own thinking about whatever racial problems they have up there
[05:54:55] <kuudes> there is rather little racial problems there, I think

[06:03:43] <kuudes> it has been weird as sanomat newspapers, which are liberal, and which have turned against "covid fear" since at least summer 2021, have sort of wanted to write well about the convoy protests, which have been mainly finns aligned illiberal people who have apparently sometimes attacked journalists who have went to interview them
[06:04:45] <kuudes> so then they have had to write something like "the points are valid, people are fed up, but also these convoy people are insane and we should have better protests against any potential restrictions"

[06:11:06] <kuudes> about 20% is pro more safety measures, about 30% is pro stopping any measures

[06:12:28] <kuudes> and people seem mostly worry about other people either getting ill or losing job, but not themselves either

[19:03:30] <zebrask> I think the startup would have been starting in the past 2 years, and she's not white. Some of the posts had pictures and she had darker skin but of ambiguous ethnicity to my eyes. Could have been Indian or middle eastern or something.
[19:03:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Divia...?
[19:03:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Doesn't match most of the other stuff though)
[19:04:12] <PapuaHardyNet> a better idea is for zebrask to contact Sarah and ask her if she knows someone of that sort
[19:04:15] <zebrask> No, Divia seems to live in Reno, and I'd remember if it were her.

[19:05:00] <two2thehead> alright
[19:05:15] <feep> oh, the lander, yeah
[19:05:24] <kuudes> they are better. older daughter has returned to school and younger will return to daycare tomorrow unless anything changes

[19:33:06] <Robomot> The "misinformation problem" seems like misinformation (If anything people have become better informed)
[19:33:42] <zebrask> I think it's probably to signal that it's more of a personal blog.
[19:36:12] <zebrask> It's such a minor cursor effect and the rest of the design is generally pretty professional, so I think it's a relatively unobtrusive way to set the vibe of, "This is a small personal blog with my random thoughts, like you used to get in the earlier web"
[19:38:46] <gwern> seems excessive to lowercase and colorize stuff *and* have cursor effects
[19:38:53] <gwern> still, I've seen far worse cursor effects
[19:42:40] <kuudes> hmm, it seems falcon launch error probability is still likely over 1% and it was still over 2.5% when they started crewed flights. so 1/40 chance to die on the test flight
[19:43:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: I don't know what you mean by saying that the rest of the design is professional
[19:43:09] <gwern> kuudes: so, better than the shuttle?
[19:44:38] <zebrask> Obormot\Arcturus: It's a standard Hugo site that is easy to read on mobile and desktop with a clear font. The lower casing is only in the post titles.
[19:45:48] <zebrask> I got a distinct vibe from the page immediately but didn't need to use reader mode or anything to read the posts (not something I can say for SSC or Zvi's blog, for example)

[19:48:14] <kuudes> I guess?
[19:49:01] <PapuaHardyNet> goddamn, you just dissed Zvi's blog
[19:49:20] <PapuaHardyNet> I love Zvi's blog, it is so comfy I have no idea what you have against it
[19:50:25] <zebrask> To be fair to Zvi, the real problem is that mobile browsers infuriatingly refuse to reflow.
[19:50:58] <PapuaHardyNet> priya's website on the other hand signals unprofessionalism / personal blog, and some other dimensions I don't like but cannot explain. The lack of capital letters, the utter emptiness, no sidebar, the sparse top bar
[19:51:07] <PapuaHardyNet> the freaking cursor thing
[19:51:58] <PapuaHardyNet> Zvi's blog is great. SSC is a classic. Priya's blog could have been great if it was like Drew DeVault's blog, but hey, she is signalling something else entirely
[19:52:15] <zebrask> The text is a little too small for me to read comfortably on my phone; I can make it out just fine but it causes more eye strain and I can't read as fast as if it were like 30-40% larger. If mobile browsers would reflow I would just zoom to a level I found comfortable and trigger a reflow, but all mobile browser developers decided at some point ~10 years ago that people want all of their web sites to be PDFs and not epubs.
[19:52:35] <PapuaHardyNet> oh man, reading on mobile is torture
[19:52:43] <kuudes> imo zvi is too much "covid has been solved"
[19:52:49] <zebrask> SSC's problem is that the text is too small and the sidebars are fixed on mobile.
[19:52:55] <kuudes> but maybe he is more calibrated to usa situation

[19:56:47] <kuudes> launching is getting safer by failure factor of about 3/4 per year, landing about 2/3 per year
[19:56:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> New York not last in Agreeableness, amazingly enough (that would be Alaska), but we do place 47th out of 51
[19:57:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alaska is also last in Conscientiousness
[19:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> And 49th in Extraversion
[19:57:26] <kuudes> O_o
[19:57:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> And 47th in Neuroticism
[19:57:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> And 49th in Openness.
[19:57:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> In short
[19:57:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alaskans just don't have personalities
[19:57:53] <kuudes> larger number means more of the trait? or less?
[19:57:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> One wonders if the researchers interviewed the polar bears by mistake
[19:58:01] <PapuaHardyNet> heh
[19:58:17] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm moving to Alaska, gentlemen. I'm sure people would find me the life of the party
[19:58:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: This is by rank, from highest to lowest, and larger numbers mean more of the trait, yes
[19:58:19] <gwern> 'thats fair enough but can i atleast take all of the shit from my site first and download it. how can i get a backup as i cant put funds in my account and take out the files from the site as its physiclly impossible as the site wont let me so plz explain so i can move all my shit from this host to another' <-- I bet this person mysteriously keeps experiencing problem after problem in their life
[19:58:22] <zebrask> In any case I think it's a deliberate effort to set the vibe, and I found it didn't impede readability, so it seems like it's tailored to set the vibe without actually being distracting, rather than just being whimsical and ignoring practical design considerations.
[19:58:46] <kuudes> thanks
[19:58:49] <zebrask> Though I'm not a Priya stan, I just liked some of the posts 😛 It's not the page I'd make, but I can understand why someone would do it.
[19:59:03] <kuudes> it sounds weird new york being that low on openness?
[19:59:11] <kuudes> I mean, opennness is highly correlated with iq
[19:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> New York is 3rd in N and 2nd in O!
[19:59:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: er, no, we're 2nd *highest* in O, you're confusing rank with score
[19:59:40] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: Big Five is a spectrum. being low on a dimension means being high on the other endpoint. bing low on Extraversion = high on Introversion. low on Neuroticism = high on Stability
[19:59:40] <kuudes> ah, it was alaska that was 49
[19:59:48] <PapuaHardyNet> zebrask: yeah, don't worry about it. I'd ignore the design choices if Priya was someone I respected and knew about
[19:59:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> ah
[20:00:02] <kuudes> I confused the numbers, sorry
[20:00:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yeah, I know, but the bears joke required the other interpretation :p
[20:00:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> North Dakota, of all places, ranks first in E *and* A!
[20:01:10] <gwern> huh. I wonder if that's Amish or something
[20:01:33] <gwern> (north dakota being such a tiny population, even relatively small groups could be swinging it)
[20:02:50] <kuudes> dc is 1st on openness and 3rd on extraversion, yeah, ok
[20:03:27] <gwern> dc is the dream of every ivy-league democrat
[20:03:52] <kuudes> was N sort of inverted? low N is better?
[20:04:15] <gwern> yes, usually N is seen as bad
[20:04:46] <gwern> lots of associations with mental illness and unhappiness. and the J-factor people have N as one of the most J-loaded
[20:05:40] <kuudes> hmm. I guess you could take the table from wiki and invert the sign of N score and then take hypothenusa of the scores to see state positions on general good manifold or something
[20:06:08] <zebrask> What is the scale of "score" here?
[20:06:08] <two2thehead> kuudes, i'm waiting for us county level studies

[20:06:25] <zebrask> Is this out of 10? Normalized by state means or something?
[20:06:28] <kuudes> presumably normal, zebrask, ie N(0,1) or something
[20:06:41] <gwern> kuudes: that would be J yeah
[20:06:56] <two2thehead> .note two2thehead 5 min timer test in 5m
[20:07:00] <zebrask> For "Openness" the range for those states is -3.x to +3.x

[20:07:47] <zebrask> gwern: But I don't see the scale. What is the maximum an individual could get on these tests?

[20:09:26] <zebrask> I don't think you can average percentiles, and there are negative numbers.
[20:09:59] <zebrask> Units people! And label your damn axes!
[20:10:11] <two2thehead> feep, are you *sure* this is a timer based message sender?
[20:10:41] <feep> two2thehead: it's still a note, it doesn't trigger on its own
[20:10:53] <feep> it just triggers at the soonest at t~5m
[20:10:56] <feep> also you did it wrong :p
[20:11:10] <feep> .note two2thehead in 5m it tells you when you do the syntax right
[20:11:22] <two2thehead> ah gotcha
[20:11:44] <gwern> (of course you can average percentiles, you know it's a transformation of a normal distribution, so you can transform, average, transform)
[20:12:24] <zebrask> OK, paper says these are z-scores.
[20:13:18] <PapuaHardyNet> "In Rust, variables are immutable by default." this is dumb
[20:13:55] <zebrask> So does that mean that people in Washington, D.C. are on average 6 standard deviations more open than the average in ND? Wild.
[20:14:19] <zebrask> PapuaHardyNet: That's one of my favorite features of Rust ☹ At least when it comes to function parameters, anyway.
[20:15:05] <PapuaHardyNet> I can't see that emoji so I'm unsure whether you are mad at me or not, hahahah
[20:15:15] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I apologize if you got mad
[20:15:41] <two2thehead> zebrask, you can see why rural republicans don't comprehend washingtonites
[20:15:43] <PapuaHardyNet> for function parameters it makes sense but having to explicitly specify variables are mutable makes zero sense imo
[20:16:46] <gwern> zebrask: I'm not sure that's what it means. you'd want to look at the actual average percentile for each state. I'd guess that it's something like 'DCites are 55th percentile on average' or something. difference in group means can be very precise and very powerful while still being small magnitude
[20:17:05] <kuudes> utah has the largest sumscore (other axis positive but N inverted)
[20:17:11] <kuudes> alaska has the lowest sumscore
[20:17:11] <gwern> this is because we think of tails more than expectations for many things
[20:17:42] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: neat does that too, it has some advantages for reference counting
[20:19:23] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: if you think it makes sense then it probably does, all right
[20:20:05] <zebrask> PapuaHardyNet: It was a frowny face. Good lord do people really get mad over those sorts of things?
[20:20:09] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: the advantage is, and this is pretty neat specific so may not apply to rust, if you have like
[20:20:22] <feep> Object a = new Object;
[20:20:26] <feep> Object b = a;
[20:20:36] <feep> now if a is mutable, b needs to hold an independent reference to a
[20:20:37] <kuudes> 6,41 Utah; 4,1 Georgia; 3,53 Nebraska; 3,47 Colorado; 3,4 Florida; 2,97 Minnesota; 2,89 Wisconsin; 2,88 South Dakota; 2,72 New Mexico; 2,6 District of Columbia; 2,53 North Dakota; 2,19 Kansas; 2,12 North Carolina; 2,04 Arizona; 1,88 Missouri; 1,73 Illinois; 1,69 Tennessee; 1,57 Oklahoma; 1,54 Oregon; 1,53 Texas; 1,06 Michigan; 1,05 Washington; 0,92 California; 0,51 South Carolina; 0,22 Mississippi; -0,25 Nevada; -0,33 Indiana; -0,57 Iowa; -0,75 Montana; 
[20:20:37] <kuudes> -0,77 Vermont; -0,93 Pennsylvania; -1,04 Louisiana; -1,42 Idaho; -1,55 Ohio; -1,64 New Jersey; -1,64 Alabama; -1,76 Delaware; -1,85 Massachusetts; -2,01 Virginia; -2,08 Connecticut; -2,09 Kentucky; -2,23 Arkansas; -2,38 New York; -2,52 Hawaii; -2,63 Maryland; -2,71 West Virginia; -2,86 New Hampshire; -2,98 Maine; -4,57 Rhode Island; -4,89 Wyoming; -9,13 Alaska
[20:20:46] <feep> because otherwise you can do a = null, and now b is orphaned
[20:20:58] <feep> but if a is at least headconst, you can just share the same reference
[20:21:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, because a is immutable, b can just share the reference of a, which saves memory
[20:22:02] <kuudes> java solves it by everything being a reference
[20:22:09] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds like a very specific scenario to me tbh, I'm not very convinced
[20:22:15] <feep> now this is a trivial example, but there`s some other cases where you can reuse a single reference throughout an expression, and never need to call -- nono, in neat, objects are always a reference
[20:22:23] <feep> java solves it by having a gc
[20:22:48] <feep> the point is, in a naive refcounted language, like 30% of your runtime will be reference count increments/decrements
[20:22:59] <kuudes> yes
[20:23:03] <zebrask> I think in general it's a good design principle because the compiler can easily complain that you've tried to mutate something immutable, but it won't complain if you have something mutable that you simply failed to mutate.
[20:23:08] <feep> you start looking to optimize every corner you can
[20:23:36] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: it is a very specific example of a general effect.
[20:23:38] <kuudes> I got so tired of that with symbian that I really like anything that just solves it somehow on the background and the programmer needs not to worry about it
[20:24:07] <kuudes> ::NewLC
[20:24:16] <zebrask> So if you want to really know whether mutability is a feature the user is intentionally using or just incidentally using because they didn't bother to specify `const`, you can either have the compiler complain whenever you fail to mutate a mutable variable or make immutability the default.
[20:24:48] <PapuaHardyNet> so that's like a fail-explicit design
[20:24:58] <PapuaHardyNet> which is better than fail-silent design
[20:25:30] <kuudes> yeah, const by default is the sane choice; declare mutability if you need
[20:25:38] <zebrask> I also tend to hate mutating stuff in general; it's way easier to accidentally have partially-initialized objects or objects in some weird state.
[20:25:39] <PapuaHardyNet> is that what you mean zebrask? honestly I'm just taking feep at his word here that immutability reduces memory and compute overhead
[20:26:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I imagine using python would be such a pain if everything was immutable by default hahah
[20:26:13] <zebrask> PapuaHardyNet: Yeah, though it's not so much about failure as something more akin to having more accurate ground truth.
[20:26:32] <kuudes> well, it enables easy parallerizations etc
[20:26:48] <kuudes> ie if you know the inputs to something are immutable, you can just copy them and forkjoin
[20:27:08] <zebrask> It would be way, way easier for Python the language to evolve, be made faster, etc, if the interpreter always knew when you planned to mutate things.
[20:28:00] <zebrask> I try not to mutate stuff in Python either for the most part. When using attrs I usually specify `frozen=true` (might be the default now with `attrs.define`).
[20:29:54] <PapuaHardyNet> zebrask: I'd love to take a look at your python code tbh
[20:30:05] <feep> zebrask is correct as well
[20:30:30] <feep> but I suspect that the performance argument is more convincing for people who don`t have experience with immutable-by-default

[20:32:18] <kuudes> "As part of the move, the State Department ordered the destruction of networking equipment and computer workstations and the dismantling of the embassy telephone system, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter and internal communications reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Those moves render the Kyiv embassy inoperable as a diplomatic facility."
[20:33:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I will handle these things. The Wikipedia media file should do the same transformation that Robomot does, imo (the metadata could perhaps be put into the `title` attribute of the image)...
[20:34:50] <gwern> (a number of these were broken by my redirect-updating project last month - they moved entire domains. like the github.com icon is 'broken' because that user page got moved to github.io etc)
[20:34:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (Please note, I am doing a major refactoring on linkicon implementation, so I am making note of these issues, but we'll need to re-check after the refactor to see if they still exist - if so, I'll fix)

[20:38:18] <zebrask> One nice thing about Rust is that every block "returns" the value of the last statement in it, so you can do something like `let x = { let mut b = MyThing(); b.x = 1; b.y = 2; b }`
[20:39:28] <zebrask> Though you can also do stuff like `let mut x = 1; x += 3; let x = x;`, which "turns off" the mutability of `x` after you are done with it.

[20:40:50] <ardent[m]> Obormot\Arcturus: I parsed linkicon as some kind of weeb fetish at first and wondered why I had never heard of it
[20:40:57] <zebrask> Most common is the builder pattern, where you have `let mut builder = MyThingBuilder(); builder.with_x(1); builder.with_y(2); let x = builder.build()` (It's not quite as stupid as that, and people often do chained calls instead of making the builder itself mutable, but you get the gist)
[20:41:49] <kuudes> thing = new Builder().thingX().thingY().build();
[20:42:41] <feep> with (Thing.Builder()) { x = 1; y = 2; return value; }
[20:43:08] <feep> `s what we use at work

[21:01:52] <kuudes> ggreer, a minor piece of observation that imo might be useful for you: I have currently been off from work since last wednesday because of some airway infection. covid home tests have been negative though. still, as the maximum harm I have got from vaccine has been 2 days off from work, it seems that it would have been net beneficial for me to get 3 additional doses if it would have meant that I did not fall ill this time
[21:03:15] <ggreer> wtf? you've been so sick that you couldn't work for almost a week?!
[21:03:19] <kuudes> yes
[21:03:24] <kuudes> I have 4 doses
[21:03:41] <kuudes> could be just some other respiratory infection of course
[21:03:43] <ggreer> the last time that happened to me I was hospitalized with pneumonia
[21:03:47] <kuudes> and likely I have had bad luck
[21:03:54] <ggreer> and that was... 30 years ago
[21:04:00] <kuudes> nice! :)
[21:05:03] <kuudes> I have been hoping to return to work on thursday, but today my oxy levels have been dipping to 92-94 at times from normal 97-98
[21:05:12] <kuudes> but now they are again normalish, so no worry
[21:05:43] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes gonna buy a crate of vaccines this weekend using his connections
[21:05:56] <PapuaHardyNet> covid prepping ;)
[21:06:08] <kuudes> well I have been trying to, but it is hard over here
[21:06:35] <PapuaHardyNet> have you tried less legitimate sources?
[21:06:39] <kuudes> but I have updated a bit more toward that if I recover this week, I will try to get extra dose with a prescription next week, and then omicron dose when they come out
[21:07:07] <PapuaHardyNet> that's good to hear that you'll get two extra doses, yeah
[21:07:07] <kuudes> trustworthiness is an issue
[21:07:26] <kuudes> not sure yet
[21:07:40] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: have you thought of travelling to places with easier access to vaccines? trustworthiness should be a bit less of an issue there
[21:07:52] <ggreer> just drive somewhere else and lie about your name. that's what my covid-paranoid friends have done
[21:07:53] <PapuaHardyNet> if you are getting the vaccines from official authorities in those places I maen
[21:07:59] <kuudes> they said that they will give me such with prescription the last I called, but they said similar already for the 4th dose and then it got really hassle when I went to the site
[21:08:16] <kuudes> ggreer, we have population registry
[21:08:25] <kuudes> but yeah, there are things that can be done
[21:08:58] <kuudes> name lying does not work, you would have to buy fake papers, as your id is checked and your vaccine dose is marked to national db
[21:09:13] <ggreer> how do illegal immigrants get vaccines?
[21:09:14] <kuudes> but it is possible to use privacy controls to hide your doses and go to other city
[21:09:16] <kuudes> badly
[21:09:36] <kuudes> it is recommended the cities give vaccines if someone says they are an illegal immigrant
[21:11:00] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: time to larp as an illegal immigrant lmao
[21:11:02] <ggreer> ok so say you're an illegal immigrant
[21:11:10] <kuudes> I don't look like one
[21:11:17] <ggreer> claim you're american or something
[21:11:20] <PapuaHardyNet> lol
[21:11:31] <kuudes> then they will ask for my us passport
[21:11:41] <PapuaHardyNet> say you were adopted?
[21:11:42] <gwern> you burned your passport as a protest against police brutality
[21:11:46] <kuudes> XD
[21:11:49] <ggreer> heh
[21:12:12] <ggreer> or get a really good fake US passport and then just... go to the US and get as many vaccines as you want
[21:12:24] <kuudes> indeed
[21:12:44] <kuudes> I have tried to buy those animal covid vaccines as well, but they are also kept under similar control
[21:13:02] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm just going to say that this sounds extremely hilarious
[21:13:17] <kuudes> I agree
[21:14:58] <kuudes> legally it seems the cities have a duty to give out any vaccines they have and which the person has a doctor's prescription for
[21:15:02] <kuudes> but it has been messy
[21:16:10] <kuudes> so far they have denied prescription vaccines at least once to my kids, when there were no recommendations for under 12 yo vaccinations but usa and austria and slovakia and some others were already vaccinating as fda and ema recommended to
[21:16:24] <gwern> ggreer: passports are so computer-linked these days, I wonder if anyone but intelligence agencies even *can* fake passports anymore
[21:16:51] <gwern> at the very least, you need to get a fake identity or legend into the databases. can't just have a good-looking passport, need a valid number etc
[21:18:42] <kuudes> yeah

[21:19:17] <kuudes> people supposedly born in the occupied areas in world war II
[21:19:29] <kuudes> as back then population registries were in physical books in churches
[21:19:37] <kuudes> so some of those books got extra entries
[21:19:59] <kuudes> it was problematic as those known nonexistent persons appeared in 00s to have had children
[21:20:34] <kuudes> I think this is related to why passports these days mandatorily have fingerprints on them
[21:21:07] <ggreer> passports are good for a decade. one's appearance can change quite a bit over that time. my guess is that outside of governments, "fake" passports are acquired by finding some destitute american/brit/canadian/etc who looks like the client, paying them to get a passport, then shipping that passport to the client
[21:22:18] <ggreer> then you just have to find an excuse for why the visa stamps don't make sense
[21:24:00] <PapuaHardyNet> "my girlfriend kidnapped me and left me stranded in finland. I still love her so I don't want to press charges."
[21:25:02] <ggreer> or just find out what the stamps look like and stamp it yourself
[21:25:24] <kuudes> I don't actually have a passport anymore, just an id card
[21:25:34] <kuudes> because I dislike giving fingerprints :-/

[21:48:33] <kuudes> indeed

[23:00:53] <gwern> two2thehead: yes, the blue-haired autist girl is a very recognized character archetype. but if you put rei and yuki side by side, you can see why a mtf would prefer the latter. plus yuki has some more relevant character traits like being a hacker in that one episode where the club plays a space warfare game against the nerds
[23:01:09] <two2thehead> 'Chūnibyō is a Japanese colloquial term typically used to describe early teens who have grandiose delusions, who desperately want to stand out, and who have convinced themselves that they have hidden knowledge or secret powers.'
[23:01:12] <PapuaHardyNet> yuki is from the god-girl anime?

[23:01:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I just forgot the name hahah, thanks
[23:01:58] <two2thehead> :)
[23:02:15] <two2thehead> the endless eight arc killed any hope of haruhi season 3. Change my mind
[23:02:34] <gwern> nah. what killed it was nothing good in the novels to adapt

[23:02:53] <gwern> whatever woes endless eight caused were long since wiped out by the colossal success of _disappearance_
[23:03:00] <two2thehead> hm
[23:03:07] <two2thehead> okay fine. but it certainly didn't help
[23:03:10] <gwern> the problem is... there's just nothing to follow up _disappearance_. the plot basically halts
[23:03:22] <two2thehead> _disappearance_ was VERY well animated imo
[23:03:37] <two2thehead> and non-DataintegrationThoughtEntity Yuki was cute
[23:03:44] <gwern> there's some confusing stuff about a rival or earlier SOS-dan, and yuki gets desperately sick, and then... tanigaru *stopped publishing* for over a decade
[23:03:56] <gwern> oh, he released some bullshit anthology a few months ago, and that's about it
[23:05:00] <gwern> and kyoani probably isn't too keen on it. everyone there from haruhi is either gone or dead in a fire
[23:05:39] <gwern> they make a ton of money and can do their own projects even if tanigaru suddenly pulled a million words out of his ass to wrap up the series in a satisfying fashion
[23:06:53] <feep> to be clear, literally dead in a fire
[23:06:57] <gwern> all in all, we'll see more _spice & wolf_ anime before we ever seen any sequel to _disappearance_
[23:07:32] <two2thehead> feep, yep
[23:07:39] <gwern> (at this point I can't even be all that angry at tanigaru. he's almost certainly mentally ill)

[23:27:52] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao, you weren't kidding when you said that
[23:28:49] <PapuaHardyNet> according to the article, bone marrow transplants is how people are cured of HIV, and most donated transplants that the medical community has, as far as I can tell, are from "Northern Europeans"
[23:29:11] <gwern> (it is weird, though, you'd think any anti-HIV mutation would be in africa, not caucasians, both because HIV came from there and simply because they have the most mutations by far floating around)
[23:30:44] <PapuaHardyNet> well, if you are african and you don't get HIV, what are the chances that you'd be donating your bone marrow anyway?
[23:30:56] <PapuaHardyNet> seems like the donor demographic is very skewed towards developed nations
[23:31:11] <gwern> they can be recruited. but since none of them have it, it is moot
[23:31:39] <PapuaHardyNet> find people, inject them with HIV, take the bone marrow of the survivors. sounds like a plan
