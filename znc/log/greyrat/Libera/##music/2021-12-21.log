[20:20:03] <murthy> MusicalDillo: Thanks for sharing!
[20:20:15] <MusicalDillo> yw
[20:20:18] <murthy> FreeRangeDillo: Nice. I am good too, ty
[20:21:09] <MusicalDillo> If you decide to make a page for MIDI sequence loops, let me know and I'll put up some more
[20:22:04] <murthy> MusicalDillo: yes indeed, what do we call the page?
[20:22:11] <murthy> Resources?
[20:22:54] <murthy> We will put all the music stuff there, even links to sound fonts too
[20:23:02] <FreeRangeDillo> MIDI Sequence Loops, I suppose, or MIDI Resources if you want it to contain more generalized info
[20:23:19] <FreeRangeDillo> Hey, whatever
[20:23:23] <murthy> Ok
[20:24:40] <MusicalDillo> Sure, MIDI Sequences could be a subset of a Resources page
