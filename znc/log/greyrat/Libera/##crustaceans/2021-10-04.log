[00:00:33] <skyl4rk> which one
[00:02:23] <Brekkjern> I'd completely forgotten that series
[00:02:33] <Brekkjern> "Gubben og Katten" was it's name in Norwegian
[00:02:47] <skyl4rk> but whichever it is my answer would be the same: overall in swedish is the first one, the suspender-pant thing is snickarbyxa "carpenter's pant", but I don't know how well those terms align with the english terms
[00:03:14] <skyl4rk> Brekkjern: I like all the small funny details added to every picture
[00:03:20] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:03:23] <Brekkjern> It was a funny series
[00:03:50] <skyl4rk> same way with Don Rosa's contributions to disney
[00:03:55] <Brekkjern> True
[00:04:09] <Brekkjern> Nissemaskinen was my fav book
[00:04:18] <Brekkjern> No idea what it was called in Swedish
[00:04:56] <skyl4rk> we had a tomtemaskinen as one of our "adventskalendern" tv series
[00:05:34] <Brekkjern> I can't remember watching it. Only reading the book
[00:06:12] <Brekkjern> Aww man! It was on NRK at some point, but it's not available anymore :(
[00:07:00] <gerikson> Pettsson & Findus are great
[00:08:06] <skyl4rk> I remember building a santa claus machine based on it, as a kid, some carpentry meccano, electrical motor and limit switches
[00:08:19] <skyl4rk> probably my first engineering project

[01:13:58] <Brekkjern> Someone has made a bot that responds to people saying "water is wet" by replying this:
[01:13:58] <Brekkjern> > Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.

[15:00:23] <phil> I mean, I don’t trust Google all that much on this, but they do say if you want to not be indexed by the GoogleBot, then put the relevant metatag in your html or in the http response & they’ll honour it.
[15:01:02] <phil> If you’re not willing to actually do that, then you clearly don’t actually care about this, you just want to moan about Google dropping support for noindex in robots.txt
[15:01:38] <phil> (which, to be fair, they ought to honour but they have a figleaf to hide behind if it’s never been standardised.)
[15:53:18] <dimadima> Brekkjern: my understanding is this site owner is opting out of google indexing because they feel like google is a thread to democracy
[15:53:26] <dimadima> thread*
[15:53:35] <dimadima> gah! **threat**
[15:54:55] <dimadima> they're prioritizing freedom over convenience (in this case, the ability to be found online)
[15:55:28] <dimadima> they don't get freedom right away, so it's more of a personal statement
[15:55:43] <dimadima> a principled stand
[15:55:49] <dimadima> what do you think?
[16:39:22] <gwozniak> I get not trusting Google and not being a fan of what they do. I don't see how removing your site from Google's search bot is going to do much to stop that
[17:07:03] <Brekkjern> My point exactly
[17:08:07] <Brekkjern> IMO, Google should just not respect those no-index things (same with all other search providers)
[17:08:17] <Brekkjern> If it's publically available, it's publically available.
[17:09:12] <Brekkjern> If you don't want something available, put it behind a login like the rest of the dark web

[18:29:55] <manicennui> dimadima: That submission went nowhere. I'm very disappointed in you.
[19:09:39] <dimadima> gwozniak: we've got to start somewhere. if people didn't take "principled stances" lots of things wouldn't have happened. we can't expect wikipedia to remove itself from google. but we can have individuals draw attention to these problems
[19:10:35] <manicennui> I don't even understand the problem.
[19:11:07] <dimadima> Brekkjern: the web is more nuanced than that. and every country has its own laws around this stuff. recently US courts ruled that if something is public on the web, you're legally allowed to scrape it. that's cool. but on the other hand, public things on the web *do* have "terms and conditions" that you tacitly accept by using the site
[19:12:03] <dimadima> manicennui: "…the essence of the exploitation here is the rendering of our lives as behavioral data for the sake of other’s improved control of us."
[19:12:20] <kline> dimadima, not sure tacit acceptance has ever been the required standard to hold someone to account when you try to enforce T&Cs
[19:12:53] <manicennui> dimadima: We are already far past that point. I'd argue that Google is one of the least bad actors in that regard.
[19:12:58] <dimadima> kline: yes tacit was the wrong word. these days we accept those nags
[19:14:02] <dimadima> kline: i'm just trying to say that there are laws and regulations governing our interactions on the Internet
[19:14:25] <dimadima> it's far from anarchy, in terms of the law at least (in reality, though, it sort of it)
[19:14:32] <dimadima> sort of is*
[19:15:31] <dimadima> manicennui: why is google one of the least bad actors and what's a worse actor or type of actor if any comes to mind,?
[19:16:59] <manicennui> Most of what Google seems to use the information for actually benefits its users or is just targeting ads.
[19:17:16] <dimadima> manicennui: also yeah that post went nowhere, and that reflects well on HN
[19:17:18] <manicennui> Companies like Facebook seem focused on not just targeting ads, but changing discourse.
[19:17:44] <manicennui> They all obviously do bad shit in China, etc.
[19:17:47] <dimadima> do you think it's possible google does a good job of keeping a clean image
[19:18:16] <manicennui> I think it's entirely possible that at some point in the future Google gets new execs and they start doing real evil with all of the data they have.
[19:18:18] <dimadima> they've managed to do this by staying out of social media. but behind the scenes, is there a good reason to expect they're not wheeling and deeling data
[19:18:34] <manicennui> Right now it seems like pretty typical corporate shenanigans.
[19:18:47] <manicennui> Facebook on the other hand seems to be having a truly negative impact on humanity.
[19:19:00] <dimadima> yes i see that
[19:19:01] <manicennui> Google has only stayed out of social media because they can't figure it out.
[19:20:25] <dimadima> something about the surveilling though. i'm not an articulate person but there seems to be a direct relationship between "freedom" and privacy
[19:20:58] <dimadima> if someone is collecting the amount of data that google is collecting... what good can come of that for people beyond the conveniences of google maps
[19:21:18] <companion_cube> manicennui: youtube's recommendation algorithm also has a very negative impact on humanity
[19:22:39] <manicennui> companion_cube: It recommends something questionable to me once in a while, but it's pretty easy to steer it away.
[19:22:58] <manicennui> And it's typically pretty obvious why it recommended what it did.
[19:23:25] <manicennui> If you watch a bunch of Linux videos and it recommends Luke Smith (one of his videos actually about Linux), I don't think anything malicious is happening.
[19:23:27] <companion_cube> as soon as you watch one bad thing it keeps recommending similar "engagement"-driven videos
[19:23:40] <manicennui> It does that with everything though.
[19:23:50] <manicennui> If you watch a video about cats it will recommend a bunch of videos about cats.
[19:24:02] <manicennui> But you can tell it that you aren't interested and it will stop pretty quickly.
[19:24:12] <gwozniak> I don't have a profile and I get some fucked up recommendations some time, mostly if I'm looking at videos about space and astronomy
[19:24:21] <companion_cube> you can only tell it if you're logged in though
[19:24:32] <manicennui> It seems pretty tuned to focus on what you have watched recently and definitely takes your "not interested" clicks into account.
[19:24:46] <gwozniak> Lots of fake moon landing junk
[19:24:53] <manicennui> I think that's kind of interesting.
[19:25:13] <manicennui> I have YT/Google and Twitter accounts, and I've taken the time to get it the way I want and don't have the problems that most people complain about.
[19:25:37] <manicennui> I'd guess that the shit it recommends what you are not logged in is actually just popular, unfortunately.
[19:25:44] <ngoldbaum> and yet still have issues with pomposity somehow
[19:25:45] <manicennui> s/what you/when you/
[19:27:19] <gwozniak> The ad blocker I have gets rid of pretty much all recommended stuff on Twitter. I also use the "latest" timeline the vast majority of the time. Those two combined mean I see very little random stuff I don't want to see
[19:27:55] <manicennui> I use a minimalism extension for Twitter in the browser that removes all the crap on the side.

[19:28:34] <buttsbot> Minimal Twitter - Chrome Web Store
[19:36:30] <dimadima> google is certainly more elegant than facebook, but: profile building -> engagement -> echo chambers -> loss of intellectual capacity -> corporate control -> loss of freedom
[19:36:47] <dimadima> google isn't facebook, but if you're logged in, the results you get are tailored to you
[19:36:55] <bkero> nitter.ner
[19:36:58] <bkero> nitter.net
[19:37:09] <dimadima> "relevant/targeted advertising" is all of that
[19:37:19] <manicennui> dimadima: I think the difference is that there is no option not to be logged in with Facebook.
[19:37:31] <dimadima> same with google
[19:37:40] <dimadima> they build shadlow profiles just the same, i'm sure
[19:37:49] <manicennui> dimadima: I mean you can't even view shit on Facebook for the most part.
[19:37:51] <dimadima> i don't know this for a *fact*, but certainly right?
[19:38:00] <manicennui> You can watch YT just fine without being logged in.
[19:38:25] <dimadima> so theyre is less convenience. the argument that convenience makes any of this worthwhile is a thin one, i think
[19:38:34] <dimadima> it definitely adds something
[19:38:40] <dimadima> but if anything it's more insiduous
[19:38:42] <manicennui> Unfortunately I think the content that we'd like to not see on YT is very popular.
[19:39:15] <manicennui> I don't doubt that a large number of people who search for space stuff on YT are into fake moon landings and other nonsense.
[19:39:47] <dimadima> bkero: thank you. i also recently discovered ytprivate.com in this channel or in #lobsters
[19:40:40] <dimadima> manicennui: there's got to be another way to disocver content though. if the stakes are basic freedom and global corporate hegemony lol
[19:41:00] <dimadima> bloomberg is running articles like amazon needs a spot at the UN and HN doesn't even flinch anymore
[19:41:06] <dimadima> it's literally boring lol
[19:41:35] <dimadima> meanwhile americans are not just rejecting covid vaccines, but are now rejecting all vaccines
[19:41:44] <gwozniak> I don't trust Google to be all that benevolant, but I trust them more than Facebook
[19:42:27] <gwozniak> I do think massive data collection isn't a great idea and needs to be regulated better
[19:43:22] <gwozniak> I don't think that taking your site out of Google's search results is of any use in that regard
[19:44:57] <dimadima> it's of no direct use, that's true. but it put the topic on the homepage of hacker news

[20:08:41] <dimadima> manicennui: eh personally i'm big into the right to be forgotten
[20:09:06] <manicennui> Sure, but is that limited to just accounts you created?
[20:09:20] <manicennui> In the EU can you ask Google to remove your site from its indexes?
[20:14:51] <dimadima> i'm not sure. possibly for more legal reasons than in the US
[20:15:04] <dimadima> i didn't even mean that though. i understand that's a term and i shouldn't have used it
[20:15:17] <dimadima> i meant more like i sort of envy my ancestors who just lived and died and that was it
[20:15:37] <dimadima> they could have kept a journal if they wanted to, some scant records of them may or may not exist somewhere
[20:15:46] <dimadima> but basically their lives were self contained
[20:16:08] <dimadima> i'm just to live on and on as data
[20:16:13] <dimadima> that bums me out
[20:16:16] <Brekkjern> https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/
[20:16:16] <buttsbot> Everything you need to know about the "Right to be forgotten" - GDPR.eu
[20:16:34] <manicennui> dimadima: Yeah, but that's because your ancestors didn't do anything impressive, like conquer half the world.
[20:17:14] <Brekkjern> Generally speaking, yes, you can demand to have your data be removed from Googles index as long as there isn't a compelling reason to keep it there
[20:17:14] <dimadima> what's that got to do with anything? no one knows much about mohammad and many such people
[20:17:55] <manicennui> dimadima: We know quite a bit about many Romans.
[20:18:14] <dimadima> not really. and even what we know, it's like for several hundred or maybe several thousand people
[20:18:37] <dimadima> i don't know where Vespasian checked in when he stayed in Cesearia
[20:19:04] <deadk> what we know about the romans consist of matters of public record and things they chose to record for interestingness; their lives weren't lived on record like ours
[20:19:15] <dimadima> not even close
[20:19:32] <manicennui> I wasn't trying to claim that it was as extensive.
[20:20:12] <manicennui> And it was mostly a joke.
[20:20:23] <dimadima> ah okay sorry :)
[20:21:04] <Brekkjern> >Weep, you girls. My penis has given you up. Now it penetrates men's behinds. Goodbye, wondrous femininity!
[20:21:04] <Brekkjern> Quite a bit more than just "public record" :P
[20:21:33] <Brekkjern> >Floronius, privileged soldier of the 7th legion, was here. The women did not know of his presence. Only six women came to know, too few for such a stallion.
[20:21:48] <manicennui> Poor Floronius.
[20:21:59] <dimadima> Brekkjern: that's incredible
[20:22:40] <Brekkjern> >On June 15th, Hermeros screwed here with Phileterus and Caphisus
[20:23:06] <manicennui> I'm sure the FBI has a ton of information on people like MLK, Jr.
[20:23:07] <deadk> i think it's rather telling that i know exactly where that's from, there's only one such place and it happened quite by accident
[20:23:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:23:37] <Brekkjern> But it's still fucking hilarious :P
[20:23:41] <deadk> yes
[20:23:56] <dimadima> i had to google that phrase
[20:24:02] <dimadima> btw i tried using DDG for well over a year
[20:24:15] <dimadima> by the end i began literally hating it
[20:24:18] <Brekkjern> >On April 19th, I made bread
[20:25:29] <deadk> dimadima: well, the graffiti of pompeii is quite famous
[20:26:36] <Brekkjern> Of course it's famous with fantastic graffiti like this:
[20:26:36] <Brekkjern> >Chie, I hope your haemorrhoids rub together so much that they hurt worse than when they ever have before!
[20:27:28] <manicennui> Poor Chie.
[20:28:22] <deadk> but there will be no need for such discoveries for the historians of now, we've already sent every detail of our lives to data warehouses
[20:28:53] <manicennui> I really hate when some managers/architects/high level engineers get it in their head that  companies should have one shared model of data that everyone must implement because none of them understand the data well enough to know that it is only similar on the surface.
[20:29:36] <manicennui> We have at least half a dozen brands now, and our loans are not actually that similar.
[20:29:48] <manicennui> The loans within the brand I work on aren't even that similar.
[20:31:29] <manicennui> We are also international, which further complicates things.
[20:33:10] <manicennui> We even have a few brands all using the same collection of services/databases for customers and loans and a few other things, and it has been a nightmore.
[20:33:13] <manicennui> nightmare
[20:33:30] <manicennui> Everything has multiple optional fields to deal with all of the differences.
[20:33:51] <manicennui> And the code is spaghetti because of trying to deal with different logic for each brand.

[21:29:07] <drakonis> it got worse lol

[21:36:58] <drakonis> the government is privatizing a bunch of shit that saves them buttloads of cash
[21:37:12] <drakonis> they're privatizing electricity utilities, which is a huge WHY

[21:37:50] <dimadima> "privatize everything" bummer :9
[21:38:10] <drakonis> our minister of economy hails from the school of chicago economics that fucked up chile
[21:38:11] <dimadima> we do that sometimes in the united states and we get such nice things as enron
[21:38:20] <drakonis> you can see how chile turned out
[21:38:28] <drakonis> the rich get richer and the poor get poorer
[21:38:41] <dimadima> chicago school ppl were just trying to make that paper
[21:38:59] <drakonis> i mean
[21:39:03] <drakonis> the guy went to chile and fucked it up
[21:39:05] <dimadima> for the rich
[21:39:17] <drakonis> he actually did jackshit there but he keeps getting named as someone important
[21:39:26] <drakonis> the guy is incompetent at anything except making himself richer
[21:39:41] <dimadima> isn't it funny how that works!
[21:39:48] <drakonis> aint it
[21:39:51] <drakonis> aint it ever

[21:40:42] <drakonis> nvm
[21:40:46] <drakonis> its up, its just really slow atm
[21:41:06] <dimadima> is this all related to the FB issue? (discussed in #lobsters)
[21:41:38] <drakonis> so it seems
[21:42:39] <Brekkjern> I doubt Telegrams issues are directly related to FB. Probably just a lot more users using it than normal since Messenger is down too

[22:00:49] <manicennui> It has stevia.
[22:01:07] <manicennui> Not sure why, since it also has cane sugar.

[22:04:31] <dimadima> starbucks instant isn't my jam. i'm into the pale varieties like "davidoff"
[22:04:40] <dimadima> you know instant coffee is good when it's branded like cigarettes

[22:05:11] <dimadima> yes those big crystals
[22:05:28] <manicennui> That brand has a decaf that is good.
[22:05:54] <dimadima> i require milk in instant though... some people do not and i admire their coffee dedication
[22:06:00] <manicennui> I don't.
[22:06:08] * dimadima admires manicennui 
[22:06:38] <manicennui> I imagine if it tasted bad milk could be used to cover up the flavor.
[22:06:44] <manicennui> I just refuse to drink bad coffee.
[22:06:55] <manicennui> My caffeine addiction isn't that strong.
[22:06:59] * dimadima drops his crap stash and revels in the restored order
[22:07:11] <dimadima> manicennui: but isn't instant coffee ... bad?
[22:07:19] <manicennui> dimadima: Nope.
[22:07:26] <manicennui> It's just dehydrated brewed coffee.
[22:07:27] <dimadima> that's awesome
[22:07:31] <manicennui> A lot of the cheap stuff is bad.
[22:07:41] <manicennui> But so are the beans from those same brands generally.
[22:07:49] <dimadima> i've never had instant coffee i would say is good
[22:07:52] <dimadima> but i do drink tons of it
[22:07:53] <manicennui> I'm not going to drink Folgers or something.
[22:08:06] <dimadima> drip folgers with milk can be excellent
[22:08:11] <indigo> manicennui: Just got back from RTP last night :)
[22:08:24] <manicennui> dimadima: I first tried some random instant coffee from Whole Foods and realized that it wasn't bad.
[22:08:30] <manicennui> indigo: RTP?
[22:08:42] <indigo> Research Triangle, eg. Raleigh-Durham
[22:08:46] <manicennui> Ah.
[22:08:52] <manicennui> I don't know how people there refer to it.
[22:09:03] <manicennui> Hope you enjoyed yourself.
[22:09:05] <indigo> Pretty rural out there but some good restaurants and botanical gardens
[22:09:34] <manicennui> The Duke botanical gardens are better than Chicago botanical gardens.
[22:09:52] <manicennui> It's also within the city limits of Durham.
[22:10:02] <manicennui> Getting to the Chicago botanical gardens is a pain.
[22:10:42] <manicennui> I actually had great Indian food the last time I was in Durham.
[22:12:11] <dimadima> i don't mean to interrupt discussion of indigo's trip to NC but i just want to add one more thing about instant coffee: this is the _strangest_ instant coffee: https://www.amazon.com/Elite-Instant-Coffee-7-oz/dp/B00JNSP316
[22:12:13] <buttsbot> Amazon.com : Elite, Instant Coffee, 7 oz : Everything Else
[22:12:47] <dimadima> you can't prepare it without involuntarily insufflating it. as soon as you touch it, it just rises into the air
[22:13:26] <dimadima> and it has little to no flavor. highly recommend checking it out because it's so strange
[22:13:32] <dimadima> </end>
[22:14:09] <indigo> manicennui: The restaurants are pretty solid. Check out Di Fara and Kipos next time you go
[22:14:25] <indigo> Kipos especially was the best Greek food I've ever had
[22:15:38] <manicennui> Nice.
[22:16:20] <dimadima> indigo: taverna style restaurant?
[22:16:24] <dimadima> lemon potatos?
[22:16:50] <manicennui> dimadima: Thank you for recommending the bad coffee.
[22:16:51] <dimadima> what'd you get?
[22:17:02] <dimadima> manicennui: i *highly* recommend it
[22:21:43] <manicennui> I was a bit annoyed in Durham because the first hotel was hosting a wedding on the main floor, and the rooftop restaurant/bar was packed with people getting drunk.
[22:21:53] <manicennui> But it caused me to go out and find the Indian place.
[22:22:44] <manicennui> On my way back through I had pizza from a decent place called Pie Pushers.
[22:22:47] <indigo> dimadima: Yes! Lemon potatoes and lamb
[22:23:44] <manicennui> indigo: Do any hiking?
[22:25:12] <indigo> Just the botanical gardens
[22:25:23] <indigo> My wife has a bad hip so we did as much as she could
[22:27:09] <dimadima> yum
[22:27:18] <dimadima> i miss greek food
[22:27:26] <manicennui> Stupid bodies. When are we getting the cyborg replacements?
[22:27:38] <indigo> I miss Russian food... I should make some this weekend
[22:28:09] <dimadima> anything in particular?
[22:31:05] <indigo> I'm craving some Olivier Salad
[22:31:26] <indigo> Unfortunately my wife is not a fan... too much mayo ;)

[22:33:57] <dimadima> it was my dad's birthday the other day and he wanted olivier too
[22:34:01] <Brekkjern> Man, now I want gyros... Thanks for talking about food :P
[22:34:20] <dimadima> we pretty much do olivier for sure every new years eve
[22:34:21] <manicennui> I have never heard of Olivier salad and looking at it online, I've never seen it anywhere.
[22:34:35] <dimadima> in argentina it's called "russian salad" which i enjoy
[22:34:41] <dimadima> and turkey too, maybe
[22:35:38] <indigo> Sometimes people even put turkey in the salad
[22:36:00] <dimadima> hahaha we do that sometimes
[22:36:12] <dimadima> but usually doktorskaya kolbasa
[22:36:24] <dimadima> aka bologna
[22:36:29] <indigo> Olivier, herring under the fur coat, carrot salad, vinegret
[22:36:31] <indigo> Mmmm new years
[22:36:33] <indigo> Hehehe yes
[22:36:34] <dimadima> oh hell yeah
[22:36:48] <dimadima> what about that beet salad with walnuts and garlic?
[22:37:05] <dimadima> that's my prefered russian beet salad
[22:37:58] <dimadima> and dried prunes

[22:38:32] <manicennui> Now that I'd eat.
[22:38:59] <manicennui> Seems a bit prune heavy though.
[22:40:05] <dimadima> you can go light on the prunes!
[22:40:07] <indigo> That's a good one!
[22:40:23] <indigo> I also like the tomato slices with cheese and garlic
[22:40:34] <indigo> And pickled tomatoes too... some good stuff
[22:40:52] <manicennui> Absolutely love beets and cabbage.
[22:40:58] <manicennui> And salads made from both.
[22:41:00] <manicennui> And soups.
[22:41:30] <manicennui> I should make this really simple thing my grandmother (non-Jewish) used to make.
[22:41:48] <manicennui> Was basically just cabbage, potatoes, and sausages with minimal spices, boiled.
[22:43:24] <manicennui> I could eat that a few times per week.
[22:47:01] <dimadima> indigo:  i'm not familiar with tomatos slices w/ cheese and garlic
[22:47:23] <dimadima> manicennui: that sounds great. you might also like this russian dish: https://www.melaniecooks.com/russian-stuffed-cabbage-rolls-golubtsy-recipe/4167/

[22:49:31] <manicennui> dimadima: I've had stuffed cabbage.
[22:49:53] <manicennui> dimadima: Yeah, it commonly uses Kielbasa.
[22:51:20] <manicennui> Sausage, cabbage, and potatoes is a pretty good meal. Lots of fiber and vitamins/minerals, plus protein.
[22:51:39] <manicennui> And it's filling and cheap.
[22:52:50] <manicennui> Pretty hard to fuck it up too.

[23:22:36] * manicennui eats trail mix.
[23:22:58] <manicennui> It contains what is essentially candy, but since it contains nuts and fruits too, it is obviously good for me.
[23:24:16] <dimadima> some trail mix even has candy
[23:24:32] <dimadima> a business i wish existed is a trail mix machine
[23:24:55] <dimadima> stocked with ingredients. you go up to it or use an app to customize your mix
[23:24:58] <dimadima> and it dispenses
[23:25:05] <dimadima> can save your favorite presets
[23:25:32] <dimadima> obviously it would be called "D's Nutz"
[23:25:52] <dimadima> but if anyone is listening and wants this idea it's free and you can call it whatever you want
[23:26:34] <dimadima> i've always envisioned it at airports where people are captive, expect to spend more than usual, and want something "healthy"

[23:27:25] <dimadima> hahahahaha
[23:28:19] <manicennui> dimadima: That's not a bad idea.
[23:28:50] <manicennui> dimadima: You could also just go to the bulk food section of the grocery store and buy different amounts of nuts, dried fruits, etc. and mix them at home.
[23:29:02] <dimadima> fuuuuck that
[23:29:07] <manicennui> But I like the idea of a machine where you choose the different ingredients.
[23:29:10] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:29:17] <dimadima> i want the fancy dispensing robot thing
[23:29:21] <Brekkjern> Not as cool if you can't be prevented from mixing your trail mix by the cloud being down
[23:29:31] <manicennui> Get some limited item promotions.
[23:29:35] <dimadima> Brekkjern: this thing is offline first
[23:29:46] <dimadima> Brekkjern: its creators have been reading HN a lot so
[23:29:47] <manicennui> "This month, add flaming hot cheetos!"
[23:29:52] <dimadima> manicennui: woah hell yes
[23:30:01] <dimadima> or fritos
[23:30:19] <manicennui> Or maybe add some spices.
[23:30:25] <dimadima> a fun twist in this concept is -- no matter what the mix, it costs the same
[23:30:38] <dimadima> that's how you knows it's **extra**
[23:30:56] <dimadima> i mean the same per weight
[23:31:06] <dimadima> yesss paprika
[23:31:22] <dimadima> and it mixes it all up for you and it's a whole presentation
[23:31:31] <dimadima> and then it's like "do you want to tweet your mix?" at the end
[23:31:41] <dimadima> i've been working on this idea in my head for at least like 10 years
[23:32:19] <dimadima> if i ever get rich and no one does it, i'm going to do it
