[15:33:05] <ft> In zsh lots of the extended functionality is in functions and loadable modules. So barebones zsh may well be smaller. But I'd be surprised of the memory of a fully operational zsh process be smaller than bash.

[15:36:12] <shrikant> yes, i set dash between mksh and rc
[15:38:12] <shrikant> ft: but which lighter: zsh or bash? :)
[15:39:01] <ft> Depends on your configuration, most likely.
[15:39:41] <ft> And I'm not very familiar with fancy bash things.
[15:40:00] <ft> If I had to put money on it, I'd say bash is smaller in the common case.
[15:40:19] <ft> But like I said, I don't think it matters much.
[15:41:18] <ft> Footprint is not the only thing to optimise for. I wouldn't trade zsh's features for a couple of KiB.

[15:45:55] <ft> That is too long a story. I've been using zsh for almost 25 years… I've enabled lots of completion features. Line editor features. Tons of custom auto-loaded shell functions. That's the best two sentence summary I can give. :)

[18:33:13] <zenof> hey, how can I provide a list of fruit for completion of the following in a script: fruit=""; vared -p "Fruit:" fruit; ? I tried to set compcontext=( "Banana" "Apple" "Lemon") , but this seems insufficient? what and how do I need to load (outside the ususal zshrc context I guess...)?

[18:44:00] <guidoc> zenof: I don't think completion can be used with vared. you can use the select builtin for such a use case but you can't input arbitrary text with it
[18:44:22] <llua> it can
[18:45:13] <llua> compinit has to be loaded in the script just like it would in an interactive session tho
[18:47:47] <llua> https://asciinema.org/a/dtt9Xbckf0QuAzn5UOKOg621K
[18:49:17] <Mikachu> you would have to take some care to not overwrite the user's zcompdump, seems complicated
[18:51:12] <zenof> nice, works for me. now, how do I set a zstyle so the items ( fruit) are presented as a menu immediately? this is how my usual completion works, I think de to "zstyle ':completion:*' menu select"?
[18:51:28] <zenof> *due
[18:51:40] <llua> the same way you do it interactively
[18:51:51] <zenof> right, but it doesn't work..
[18:54:26] <zenof> after the first <tab> press it prints another line with all the fruit, after the second again , and then starts to cycle through the fruit.
[18:54:51] <llua> because you are missing other settings that is in your .zshrc to get that behavior
[18:55:52] <llua> i suspect, setopt MENU_COMPLETE
[18:56:06] <zenof> I guessed so. any ideas what this could be?

[20:50:19] <llua> seems to be due to the shell not being interactive
