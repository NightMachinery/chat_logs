[16:36:24] <bone-baboon> I received this message on Freenode "-global- [Network Notice] rasengan - Services went down at 8:28AM PST until 8:56AM PST. During this time, we discovered the NickServ nick was not locked on some servers. One of our staff members quickly reserved the nick and set +g until Services was restored. ...".
[16:36:59] <bone-baboon> Can anyone share a link with more information on this? It would be nice to know which servers were effected?
[16:39:35] <bone-baboon> How does Circe do SASL authentication? Would Circe be susceptible to this? Is there a way to authenticate the NickServ or ChanServ services I am using on an IRC network?
[16:40:05] <wasamasa> ask ##freenode about this kind of nonsense
[16:40:24] <wasamasa> the consensus so far is that freenode administration doesn't know what they're doing and that you cannot verify their claims at all
[16:40:36] <wasamasa> the bits of evidence shown so far are not in their davor
[16:41:23] <wasamasa> the usual way of avoiding this is by not manually sending an identify command to nickserv
[16:41:59] <wasamasa> see :nickserv-mask, :nickserv-identify-challenge, :nickserv-identify-command and :nickserv-identify-confirmation
[16:42:21] <wasamasa> :nickserv-mask particularly is important here
[16:42:49] <wasamasa> freenode does a very boneheaded thing of accepting NickServ!NickServ@services.
[16:43:05] <wasamasa> instead of Nickserv!NickServ@services.libera.chat
[16:43:23] <wasamasa> the handling of that mask is in irc.el
[16:43:44] <wasamasa> only if the mask matches, automatic identification is performed
[16:49:48] <bone-baboon> wasamasa: Thanks for explaining this. I will look into :nickserv-mask, :nickserv-identify-challenge, :nickserv-identify-command and :nickserv-identify-confirmation.
[16:53:36] <wasamasa> s/davor/favor/
[16:57:20] <bone-baboon> As a Circe user is there anything I can do to prevent myself from sending my password to a nickserv impersonator? For example `/msg nickserv ghost bone-baboon <password>` or any of the other nickserv commands that require a password.
[16:57:41] <wasamasa> don't do that kind of command
[16:57:48] <wasamasa> let circe handle it for you automatically
[16:58:42] <wasamasa> you could advise circe-command-MSG to do an extra check if the target appears to be nickserv
[16:59:12] <ecraven> I think I just set up SASL and never send anything to nickserv at all
[16:59:13] <wasamasa> and do the same for circe-command-QUERY
[16:59:17] <wasamasa> yes, exactly
[16:59:20] <wasamasa> that's what I'm advocating
[16:59:25] <ecraven> it really isn't that hard
[16:59:46] <ecraven> there's at least 3 (conflicting
[16:59:52] <ecraven> there's at least 3 (conflicting ;D) descriptions of how to do it
[17:01:39] <wasamasa> where?
[17:01:46] <wasamasa> are the conflicting ones in the wiki?
[17:02:43] <ecraven> when I last did this, I found a few different ways.. something with username/password, some with a key
[17:03:02] <ecraven> conflicting as in "SASL for IRC" descriptions, nothing directly circe-related
[17:03:12] <ecraven> (as I don't use SASL with circe, but with ZNC)
[17:03:49] <wasamasa> ah, ZNC
[17:04:18] <ecraven> for libera, I'm using the key-based thing, which seems rather safe
[17:04:25] <ecraven> as I don't ever use the actual password anywhere
[17:04:32] <ecraven> you need to register the key with nickserv, I believe
[17:05:08] <bone-baboon> wasamasa: Thanks I will look into those.
[17:08:28] <bone-baboon> ecraven: When you say "key-based thing" are you refering to <https://libera.chat/guides/certfp>?
[17:09:34] <bone-baboon> Should I be using certfp instead of SASL?
[17:09:51] <ecraven> ah, yes, that's what I'm using
[17:11:29] <wasamasa> I highly recommend everyone to flee freenode
[17:12:23] <wasamasa> fleenodeâ„¢
[17:13:58] <wasamasa> I've checked again and the two people from the remaining channels I wanted to migrate over disappeared from it
[17:14:06] <wasamasa> so I can finally remove it from my config
[17:14:37] <wasamasa> https://nitter.fdn.fr/ariadneconill/status/1402743349044465667#m
[17:15:05] <wasamasa> well, also deregister my channels/account
[17:15:33] <wasamasa> or maybe just my channels
[17:17:25] <ecraven> unfortunately, the user numbers of freenode are not really sinking very fast
[17:17:39] <ecraven> though libera has almost cracked 30k, while freenode has sunken below 60k
[17:20:01] <wasamasa> deleted channels and nicks
[17:38:58] <baduck> is there a description of how to do SASL auth in circe wiki?
[17:39:41] <wasamasa> it's in the README
[17:39:45] <wasamasa> why duplicate it in the wiki again
[17:42:13] <baduck> ah. that was recently added and i missed it. excellent!
[17:43:52] <baduck> btw. did you see my comment on the identify-mask in the PR for libera.chat support?
[17:44:32] <baduck> err, identify-challenge.
[17:44:36] <baduck> <- distracted
[17:45:33] <wasamasa> I don't really see the point in being uniform
[17:45:46] <wasamasa> it's not like the networks are in the first place
[17:46:02] <wasamasa> freenode ran with NickServ!NickServ!services. for who knows how many years
[17:48:03] <wasamasa> so I'd say no to the latter suggestion
[17:48:08] <wasamasa> to the former, perhaps
[17:48:16] <wasamasa> what's the difference, IDENTIFY vs identify?
[17:48:51] <wasamasa> oh, more than that

[18:41:57] <baduck> the difference to me is not wondering about the difference when staring at the acutal IRC messages and the code for both configs.  other than that FIIC.
