[01:56:45] <FromGitter> <milochadam> I think I would need more info about insert/normal modes in your case. ‚èé For example for line `def test_function()|:` where `|` is cursor, it appears over colon (`:`). You can press `a` to append something after this character (or `A`, in this scenario it works the same) for example  `def test_function(): pass|`, then you can press `ESC` to leave insert mode and the cursor is there: `def test_function(): 
[01:56:45] <FromGitter> ... pas|s`. Do you want your function to move from end of line in insert mode to `def test_function()|: pass` in normal mode or something else?

[18:18:58] <FromGitter> <edassis> Hi guys, how I do to keep the cursor centralized in the middle of the screen? I saw one toggle called "centered-point" but it's much intrusive, I wanted something like margins on top and on bottom of the screen to maintain my context in the editor without using `zz`. Thanks in advance!
