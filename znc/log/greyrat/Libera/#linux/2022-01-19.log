[01:21:50] <bovis> Using mousekeys /usr/share/X11/xkb/compat/mousekeys file, you can define actions like --  interpret [key] {action = PointerButton(button=4)} -- where [key] would cause mouse button 4 to be pushed. Forums suggest that buttons 4 and 5 scroll vertically, but I see them scroll only horizontally. Can I change that orientation? Or is there any other type of "scroll" option available within mousekeys I can use?

[07:24:12] <UPXTcgv7> The kernel is still long-term supported though.  Do you think I should try the newest longterm one?  I am trying to get rid of bugs, errors, and have the operating system run better.
[07:24:16] <matsaman> UPXTcgv7: the coolest thing about not changing the kernel setting, on top of that as a human you will not perceive a performance increase, is that you can literally copy your entire system later onto any other system of the same generic arch

[09:37:36] <matsaman> predicting failing drives is a waste of time

[09:39:12] <mitt3ns> You do literally eat up CPU running those tests anyways. Not worth it.

[09:55:29] <mlu> byebye overly expensive hardware :D
[09:55:39] <labrador> Like I cannot understand the difference b/w files and objects?
[09:55:42] <mlu> and remember: redundancy is not backup
[09:55:48] <labrador> They seem like the same thing
[09:55:49] <koollman> labrador: different api and expectations
[09:55:58] <mlu> all files are objects, but not all objects are necessarily files
[09:56:12] <mlu> directories and symlinks can be objects
[09:56:32] <firepup> isn't everything a file-
[09:56:33] <koollman> labrador: typically object storage has more limitation in my opinion. It's (generally) harder to modify content, at least modify it quickly. And coherent state is hard to maintain if you do
[09:56:38] <mlu> also, metadata can be part of an object
[09:56:44] *** Joins: oxfuxxx (~oxfuxxx@139.28.218.189)
[09:56:52] <labrador> mlu, so files are a subset of objects. An object is just binary bits and metadata along it? So what is a file then?
[09:57:00] <koollman> labrador: but, it works really well for some workloads. And perhaps even more importantly: if it can work for your goals, it's really easy to scale out
[09:57:01] <mlu> also, in practice, a filesystem image could be a single object
[09:57:07] <mitt3ns> _everything_ is a file
[09:57:10] <labrador> mlu, well isos exist
[09:57:11] <mlu> labrador: just a matter of definition at the end of the day
[09:57:14] <labrador> So they are files too
[09:57:17] <mlu> but simply said, file = object
[09:57:24] <koollman> mlu: well, not in most object systems. rewrites are usually hard :)
[09:57:30] <labrador> ok
[09:57:31] <mlu> there's just less baggage with object as a term
[09:57:33] *** Joins: vivekl (~viveklane@ip-38-34-35-85.fibre.fibrestream.ca)
[09:57:45] <mlu> oh yeah, new version = new object
[09:58:01] <koollman> like, a (posix) file has many interesting properties, it generally can be accessed randomly with seek, concurrent access work, sometimes even locking

[09:58:30] <labrador> mlu, isnt that COW?
[09:58:39] <labrador> Like zfs stores snapshots
[09:58:51] <koollman> but ... this kind of optimization and nice properties are much harder to maintain in a distributed system
[09:58:53] <mitt3ns> koollman: You generally don't re-write. FIFO stacks basically. Intermediaries that judge if the object has been acted upon and drop it.

[09:59:21] <mitt3ns> We have an in-house queuing system that works with Kafka+Ceph to basically do just that.
[09:59:24] <mitt3ns> Ahhhh yeah
[09:59:28] <mlu> labrador: not necessairly: COW usually refers to some sort of patch-based system on blocks
[09:59:38] <koollman> so, you can simplify if you decide that you want something 'easier' to manipulate than a file, with fewer promises about what you can do with the storage. object storage is one example of that
[09:59:55] <mlu> labrador: you could implement a COW system where each update patch is an object though
[10:00:00] <koollman> (easier for the storage system, not for the application using it)

[11:46:57] <koollman> pagios: for deployment, there are two general ways to do it : send the image to each clients (so, a copy), or make sure all clients respond after receiving information before sending the next one. (and since your question is a bit unclear, they aren't running the same exact image at the same time, just each using a copy of whatever data is sent, in general)

[11:50:46] <koollman> pagios: it's usually a bit hard to do right, so it's only used when it makes sense, like having 100 clients, or a very controlled environment were you know you will have to deploy images often

[15:56:36] <otisolsen70> Blondie101010, hexnewbie: would it be fair to say that RSIZE is a measure for how much RAM the process definitely takes up. And VSIZE is a somewhat larger number that the process MIGHT take up. But some of that might be memory mapped files?
[15:56:46] <Blondie101010> sure

[15:57:31] <mar77i> Sauvin: first thing I noticed was that it works if I let go the second single quote in the regex. now I noticed the plus in the character class outside of the group :D
[15:57:59] <hexnewbie> otisolsen70: If it is, e.g. a virtual machine, it may mmap() anonymous memory region the size of the virtual machine's *maximum* memory, and tell the OS it's not using half of it until the VM's memory is grown.

[15:59:48] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[16:00:39] <hexnewbie> Though I'm not sure that's entirely correct, since a machine with 32 GiB maximum memory and 8 GiB current memory is uing 9 GiB resident and 20 GiB virtual, which is neither here nor there. But that can be handwaved “or something more complicated than that”

[16:05:06] <hexnewbie> Cause with my switch to Debian, I kind of miss some of Unity's kinks, and wondered if I can bring them back.
[16:06:24] <chilversc> ah, it seems I can just use tree -dfi for my use case since I was only looking for directories, that seems to have pretty much the same output as find, but without the cycle check
[16:06:52] <loganlee> i think unity is better than the new gnome

[18:49:06] <hodapp> hexnewbie: it often does for stupid reasons like "because the package has to install this version of whatever library that stomps on whatever other library and then it goes and pisses in the registry in a way that other things fuck with"
[18:49:06] <wr> hexnewbie, i do have the machine rebooting, by the way if there is corruption somehow when i open the browser and run video, will it cause reboots, this on debian 11 xfce, what could i run to check? i also seen debsums but i'm new on it so i don't think i troubleshoot well
[18:49:27] <Nutte35> heii do you guys know how to spawn different tty in different monitor?
[18:49:31] <Dagmar> ...also Windows machines used to basically be a total free-for-all, internally, so for programs to become damaged by other programs was pretty common
[18:49:40] <hodapp> when I developed professionally on Windows, this was the case even for Microsoft's software
[18:50:04] <hodapp> stuff would just break, stuff would go missing, components would be completely gone, so the answer was just "we have no clue how that happened, so... uhh... reinstall it"
[18:50:09] <wr> hexnewbie, i was thinking on reinstalling the OS since i also don't do a format for at least 8 or 9 years
[18:50:33] <hexnewbie> wr: That's a very unlikely cause, if corruption affects both Firefox and Chromium it's either widespread or it's in a library or the kernel. It's also way more dramatic than reboots.

[19:16:07] <akk> jethro3: maybe docker? You could also probably achieve that using tools like flatpak, but with less separation than docker.

[19:16:36] <Dagmar> For _certain_ if you're using Windows you have no excuse for calling a virtual machine running Linux to be too heavyweight
[19:16:44] <ioria> on deb systems, of course
[19:16:52] <akk> debootstrap is good for installing a distro, but you still need to set up the partition or VM to install it *to*.
[19:17:02] <Dagmar> Make the VMs using logical volumes for their disks, and you can spin up snapshot clones all day long
