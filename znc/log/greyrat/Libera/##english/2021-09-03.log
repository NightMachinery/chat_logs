[00:00:16] <TechTest> I've heard many people getting it on their wrist
[00:00:17] <pussipupu> Salvia divinorum
[00:00:18] <huf> and then when it started coming back, I learned to use the mouse with my left hand so I can rest my right hand whenever
[00:00:25] <pussipupu> that's my drug suggestion
[00:00:25] <TechTest> mine starts at the elbow and goes down my fingers

[00:00:37] <huf> I wont live very long anyway :DS
[00:00:45] <TechTest> pussipupu: have you gotten epicondylitis?
[00:01:12] <pussipupu> No, I just like psychedelic drugs
[00:01:20] <gneeriiloeepdeer> do I enjoy British and Australian media because it is simply good, or is it because being born in America I have an affinity for it? I mean I have tried watching french stuff, but is boring as f(%k. German movies? one about Hitler's death and... well, nothing more... Some Japanese movies are watchable, but I only understand them with subtitles
[00:01:21] <TechTest> what?
[00:01:29] <huf> surely alcohol and sleeping in a hand brace type thing
[00:01:34] <TechTest> huf: are you using a special mouse?
[00:01:48] <huf> alcohol to dull the pain and the brace to make sure you dont hold it wrong while you're passed out
[00:01:51] <huf> TechTest: no
[00:01:59] <TechTest> lol
[00:02:13] <TechTest> I've nevee gotten drunk

[00:02:20] <huf> I acquired my wrist injury (lasted like 2 years) by consistently holding it very wrong while sleeping

[00:02:46] <gneeriiloeepdeer> oh dear god.. no
[00:02:50] <TechTest> you may are right
[00:02:54] <gneeriiloeepdeer> how can people enjoy that?
[00:02:54] <TechTest> but you are probably wrong
[00:03:12] <hoglahoo> theres no accounting for taste
[00:03:12] <huf> passing an afternoon or 900 by drinking is also known as alcoholism
[00:03:24] <huf> you know, our tribal custom
[00:03:29] <huf> our _roots_
[00:03:43] <twb> it's about a crime-fighting dog
[00:03:44] <pussipupu> one afternoon isn't
[00:03:48] <twb> how can you not like that
[00:03:54] <pussipupu> that's just the first nice day of summer
[00:03:58] <TechTest> pussipupu: what you suggested isn't even a drug, what are you using it for?

[00:04:56] <pussipupu> that doesn't make a single step a journey on a thousand miles
[00:04:59] <gneeriiloeepdeer> it is beyond me how Germans can watch the movies they make
[00:05:56] <pussipupu> TechTest: it's definitely a drug
[00:06:20] <twb> under UK legal definition, even water is a drug
[00:06:24] <huf> gneeriiloeepdeer: I hear they eat raw pork
[00:06:40] <twb> their definition was something like "any substance that has an effect on the human CNS"
[00:06:55] <huf> so the body is a drug
[00:06:55] <huf> got it
[00:07:06] <TechTest> pussipupu: it is? anyways, I'm looking for a drug to fix my arms, not just to get high
[00:07:07] <huf> well, all the substances in the body
[00:07:19] <huf> TechTest: what a weird way to look at things
[00:07:22] <TechTest> though getting high would probably make me forget the pain
[00:07:27] <gneeriiloeepdeer> I find the actors in shameless so good, their expressions are realistic

[13:32:58] <twb> Glancing at some Italian history, it looks like it was run by Regne de Sicilia for a long time, so maybe that's why I never heard it mentioned specifically

[15:03:22] <darsie> Does urad mean µrad=0.01 µGy? Does SR refer to special relativity?
[15:04:37] <twb> darsie: no
[15:04:37] <ania123> ?
[15:04:55] <twb> darsie: urad is vigna mungo.  "SR" is "self-raising", i.e. chemically leavened.
[15:05:18] <darsie> The rad is a unit of absorbed radiation dose, defined as 1 rad = 0.01 Gy = 0.01 J/kg. In physics, the special theory of relativity, or special relativity for short, is a scientific theory regarding the relationship between space and time.

[15:18:51] <twb> darsie: I gae the citation already
[15:19:17] <twb> Admittedly that's for the lactobacillus in bread yeast, rather than the lactobacillus in urad
[15:19:29] <darsie> twb: Then I guess I meant the source.
[15:19:34] <twb> I'm only using SR flour because I don't have plain flour.
[15:19:46] <darsie> ah
[15:19:52] <twb> except for rice flour and maize flour
[15:20:32] <twb> I originally tried just plain SR flour and no cleverness and the output was far too cakey and not sufficiently bready
[15:20:54] <twb> and "sourdough" bread is essentially lactobacillus ferment, so in theory this is a sensible idea
