[01:33:44] <SmokeMachine> Are there still available slots for the advent calendar?
[01:36:04] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/master/raku-advent-2021/authors.md
[01:36:13] <[Coke]> Looks like, yes.
[01:36:27] <[Coke]> I can add an entry for you if you like.
[01:46:13] <SmokeMachine> I’m still not sure if I’ll have enough time to finish my post… :(
[01:55:37] <[Coke]> I will add you as a potential-don't-count-on-me so someone can find you later to ask, OK?
[01:56:05] <[Coke]> ... nevermind, that's too much pressure.
[02:09:30] <japhb> Xliff: You probably figured this out in the ensuing two days, but if not ... For the Mandelbrot coordinates I posted, I believe to convert for the GEGL explorer: real -> x, imaginary -> y

[02:14:27] <SmokeMachine> [Coke]: I think I’m almost finishing it… but I’ll really need someone to review/price read it… my English is already not good and I’m writing that on my cellphone. So it will probably be even worse…

[02:16:04] <gfldex> SmokeMachine: Neither is my English. Yet, I never got hurt by hitting the publish button. They make those from extra soft rubber. :)
[02:18:37] <gfldex> I would go so far to say: A good post in bad English is better then a bad post is good English.
[02:22:32] <SmokeMachine> What about a bad post in bad English?
[02:27:42] <timo> if you abandon your post i will have your cord mashalled
[02:34:34] <moon-child> SmokeMachine: only way to make anything better is practice
[02:34:53] <moon-child> if you make a bad post in bad english, the next post you write will be better and better written
[02:36:12] <SmokeMachine> I’ve already done 2 other bad posts in bad English for advent calendar… this one should be going a bit better… but it seems not to be the case… :(

[15:37:01] <timo> that makes sense :D
[15:37:29] <SmokeMachine> timo: so you think I should continue or remove that phrase?
[15:37:56] <timo> you can keep the phrase but make the post longer :D

[15:39:11] <timo> SmokeMachine: is there any way to generate stuff in multiple models from just one factory? like create a post in the posts table and a bunch of tags to go with it in the tags table or something?
[15:39:19] <timo> doesn't seem like factory is set up to handle more than one model though
[15:40:24] <SmokeMachine> timo: yes, it does! https://github.com/FCO/RedFactory#readme

[15:43:13] <SmokeMachine> (I should replace that `factory-args` with `.args-to:`)

[15:44:54] <SmokeMachine> timo: it uses Red's Model.^create that already handles that
[15:47:38] <SmokeMachine> timo: with Red, if you do: `Person.^create: :name<Fernando>, :posts[%(:title<bla>, :body<blabla>), %(:title<ble, :body<bleble>)]` it will create the person Fernando and both posts using Fernando as author
[15:48:21] <SmokeMachine> (if you have a `@.posts` relationship on Person)
[15:49:43] <SmokeMachine> *:title<ble>

[17:19:58] <timo> does factory-args $num-of-posts, "post" know that .posts is an array relationship and the first argument is how many of the model "post" it will create?
[17:20:07] <timo> or rather from the factory "post"

[17:39:08] <SmokeMachine> timo: almost that... if you call factory-args with a int and any factory name it will return an array with `factors-args("post") xx $num-of-posts`
[17:46:30] <timo> nice
[17:46:59] <timo> so just factory-args Str:D, *@foo *%bar vs factory-args Int:D, Str:D, *@foo, *%bar

[18:12:53] <qorg11> What is 'Mu'exactly? is it a class where all the other classes are based?
[18:13:01] <timo> indeed
[18:13:03] <Xliff> Yes
[18:13:16] <timo> the majority of classes you'll encounter are based on Any, which derives from Mu
[18:13:24] <timo> but Junction actually derives from Mu rather than Any
[18:14:09] <qorg11> I see, thanks!

[23:54:04] <lizmat> good question... I think (oddly enough) that the #cro channel, or the #moarvm channel would be a good place, outside of this one
[23:54:22] <[Coke]> https://commaide.com/ - I see info@commaide.com suggested for a few different things, don't see a bug queue.
[23:54:40] <Skarsnik> Like it create .p6/pm6 files x)
[23:54:43] <[Coke]> what lizmat said, I know some of the devs are here on IRC
[23:56:21] <lizmat> Skarsnik: I see to recall that you could set it somewhere to create "new" style raku files
