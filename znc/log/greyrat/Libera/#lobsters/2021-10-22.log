[03:58:21] <imode> oh god.
[03:58:39] <MattWThomas> I'm surprised it's hard to find one
[03:59:21] <MattWThomas> Java is popular
[03:59:23] <companion_cube> MattWThomas: for lower taxes? but Austin is expensive otherwise… esp.  real estate now
[03:59:52] <imode> java has many UI frameworks, none of them apparently canonical or supported well enough for general use.
[04:00:10] <imode> if you ever find an answer to that, c355E3B, let me know too.
[04:00:14] <c355E3B> Darn
[04:00:14] <imode> because idfk.
[04:00:23] <c355E3B> I’m like tempted to make this a web app

[12:40:16] <simmel> Re: Release Early, Release Often?: I read somewhere that you should get a product deployed to prod ASAP even when it's just a prototype. (I.e. don't wait to fix CI/CD, packaging, publishing artifacts, etc. Do it as soon as you have a "hello world")

[12:46:00] <pja> rb: There’s an idea that I think originated with the HN crowd that just having a landing page that collects email addresses can be a great way to gauge interest in an idea. If it’s genuinely an unmet need then there will be people searching for your thing write now who will sign up & start pestering you for release dates.

[23:59:29] <jj5> ah, I just learned you can make `tail -f` follow the file name instead of the file descriptor (the default); good to know! often my `tail -f` on my web logs gets jammed when the logs rotate, but `tail --follow-name` fixes that!
