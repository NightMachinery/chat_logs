[06:57:51] <greycat> of course, that is not really a single IP address -- it's a network address range
[06:59:03] <Tach> greycat yeah I was trying something like this: echo ${'AllowedIPs = 10.10.1.4\/31'#*=}

[07:00:27] <greycat> That's... surprising.
[07:01:19] <greycat> !learn parameter A parameter is either a variable, or a special parameter. Special parameter expansions include $$ $! $? and so on. Therefore the special parameters are $ ! ? and so on.

[10:39:01] <janko> what is wrong with ".sh"?
[10:39:08] <Soliton> !.sh
[10:39:08] <greybot> Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language. See http://www.talisman.org/~erlkonig/documents/commandname-extensions-considered-harmful
[10:39:31] <Soliton> there is no point in an extension more so if it's misleading.
[10:39:34] <janko> fair enough
[10:39:57] <bud> i use .sh , because that makes sublime show a different icon for those files in the sidebar
[10:40:09] <bud> thats a point
[10:40:46] <bud> i read googles official style guide for bash the other day.
[10:41:20] <bud> they say to never use file extensions for scripts. but "library" files must have .sh and never be made executable.
[10:41:49] <bud> that sounded good.
[10:42:30] <Soliton> library file presumably means you source it. why would you not tell the one to source it what to source it with?
[10:42:52] <Soliton> next you're going to complain when they source it in their sh script.
[10:43:18] <bud> google shell guide also explicitly say the ONLY use bash.
[10:44:50] <Soliton> sounds like the guide will not be of much use in general then.

[10:51:38] <janko> :Soliton what did you mean by "fix variable cases"
[10:51:49] <emanuele6> !varcap
[10:51:49] <greybot> By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html

[10:55:40] <emanuele6> quite different from open() write() close()    open() read() close() you were using before
[10:55:51] <bud> but last line done > "$PIPE" is not what you want?
[10:56:41] <emanuele6> janko: before, on the reading end you had   while read -r < $PIPE; do ...
[10:57:10] <emanuele6> what was making the code wait was the open: < $PIPE
[10:57:53] <emanuele6> so the reading end called open() and was waiting for it to return:    ->open()<- read() close()
[10:58:17] <janko> is that what I was doing? that does in fact look redundant
[10:58:29] <emanuele6> open() will only return and make execution of the reading end proceed when another process opens it for writing

[11:00:16] <emanuele6> now that the pipe is open for writing, the reading end can wake up once the kernel finds time to run it
[11:00:34] <emanuele6> so now read() can be called
[11:00:42] <emanuele6> open() ->read()<- close()
[11:00:53] <emanuele6> read now can't read anything because there is no data in the pipe
[11:01:06] <emanuele6> it will only return once there is something to read on the pipe
[11:01:38] <emanuele6> so eventually, the writing end will run   write($status)  and the reading end will be able to continue
[11:02:13] <emanuele6> and then, if you are lucky with the timing, data will get from the writing end to the reading end
[11:02:34] <emanuele6> before the pipe gets immediately voided by the destruction of the pipeline cause by close()
[11:02:52] <bud> i was thinking, since signal traps are used anyways, couldn't this be achieved without using a pipe altogether?
[11:02:59] <emanuele6> or if you are lucky that the reading end can process the data fast enough
[11:03:53] <emanuele6> janko: now your code is correct and is much simpler, you open() in both ends before the loop starts, and you just write() every 1 second and read() whenever there is enough data to read

[15:40:56] <tirnanog> it's not bash, other than my use of brace expansion for the sake of the example.

[19:06:31] <clarkk> Soliton, thanks for your response.  I think send-keys is an argument for the byobu-tmux command, and the cd part is another argument of byobu-tmux.  I've already changed to a subdirectory of the user's home dir, so surely that's the point where it should be expanding, not the parent dir?
[19:07:10] <Soliton> it's expanded when you call byobu-tmux not at some later point.
[19:07:40] <Soliton> the caller expands it not wherever this goes.
[19:08:02] <Soliton> you seem to want to send that shell code somewhere so stop expanding it.
[19:08:03] <clarkk> ok, but I've already run         byobu-tmux send-keys "cd $WORKDIR/programs/bookmap/" C-m   on the previous line

[19:16:33] <earnestly> mihaiadrian: unreliably.  At least you should be able to use a parser that understands html to dump the style attribute in a consistent manner, then I'd probably just slice it out using PE or another tool depending on the context

[23:15:54] <Rohambili> Hi! I write a bash script to get ip address then paste into a config files multiple lines, my script is running like i imagined when i bash start.sh But when i place to /ppp/ip-up.d folder then i add  this line  /ppp/ip-up.d/start.sh to  /etc/ppp/ip-up.local did nothing. PLS Help!

[23:16:55] <Soliton> i would not call a bash script .sh
[23:17:09] <Rohambili> ok
[23:17:11] <Soliton> sounds like you did not make the script executable anyway.
