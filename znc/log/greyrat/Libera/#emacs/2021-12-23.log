[01:21:34] <oats> I realize there might be more Windows in this question than is generally acceptable, but any idea why I might not be able to run a powershell script from eshell? Any invocation of `pwsh` only shows an error, "Opening input file: Invalid argument, c:/Users/moi/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/pwsh.exe"

[01:26:26] <theothornhill> oats: When I had to do some powershell things that seemed to fix many of the issues i had.  That's all the help I can give, as I don't often use windows
[01:27:07] <tyson2> I'm using a powershell utility someone created for emacs to generate a sound in a reliable way, it seems to work well
[01:27:22] <tyson2> although it take about 8 seconds to load up
[01:27:35] <oats> theothornhill, nope, I'm just trying to invoke the pwsh binary from eshell to run a script

[07:57:28] <bpalmer> 'RadioShack is known as a consumer brand, but here, the broad goal is to become a platform that other companies (RadioShack cites Louis Vuitton, Starbucks, and Mercedes-Benz) use to run their own distributed finance projects.'
[07:58:49] <bpalmer> Per the verge's reporting, its main selling point is the brand name: '"The older generation simply doesn't trust the new-fangled ideas of the Bitcoin youth," particularly not "adults who are especially authoritarian, intelligent, and well-read (i.e., the CEOs that RadioShack seeks to woo)."' whereas they'll trust radio shack.

[11:09:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ecraven: The source file for org-contacts.el provides a capture template example. You'd also have to set org-contacts-db for queries
[11:10:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think.
[11:10:33] *** Quits: Chanakan5591_ (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:11:00] <ecraven> that's for creating, but how would you edit and add fields? it seems a bit tedious to have to open the properties drawer and then manually insert things in the correct format :-/
[11:11:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That or org-contacts-files.
[11:12:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ecraven: Possibly by using a better template you come up with. I'm not sure as I'm really working off what I can see in the source. The documentation is non-existent.
[11:13:21] <ecraven> ;) thanks for looking at it. I've read through the sources, it seems to be not very polished right now.. maybe that's an opportunity to help out ;)

[12:24:33] <tsdh> pkal: Ah, found the culprit.  I've had a default entry (t . "smtp whatever") in message-server-alist but only functions or strings are allowed.  While we are at it: in the "COND is a string" case, wouldn't using string-match-p make more sense than string=?  Then you can handle "My Name <my@address.org>" and "my+something@address.org" in one entry without having to write a function.

[18:31:19] <bpalmer> xaltsc: technically there are different environments that can run elisp. Practically speaking, for example, you can run most elisp in xemacs, sxemacs, emacs-ng , or similar. Less practically but technically, guile supports elisp.
