[22:05:51] <mago> Hi, need help translating a command..
[22:06:13] <mago> youtube-dl -i --write-info-json --extract-audio --audio-quality 192K --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvMxqcgBhWQ&list=PLBOp-S1VRfXPF79E9l5thtl0HUNMq7N-6 --postprocessor-args "-ar 44100" %dl% 
[22:06:22] <mago> How do I translate that to yt-dlp?
[22:06:31] <mago> The 44100 sample rate is failing..
[22:14:09] <mago> How can I use yt-dlp for downloading sample rate 441000 ?
[22:38:54] <mago> Once you have listed formats with --list-formats option..
[22:38:58] <mago> How do you chose the one you want?
[22:45:35] <tar_xvf> are you sure you're using yt-dlp as opposed to the older youtube-dl?
[22:45:58] <tar_xvf> i just want to make sure, even though i also alias'd youtube-dl to use yt-dlp because i type youtube-dl out of habbit
[22:46:59] <mago> yt-dlp -i --write-info-json --extract-audio --audio-quality 192K --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=931PQwTA79k&t=3066s --postprocessor-args "-ar 44100" %dl%
[22:47:11] <tar_xvf> but anyway, instead of writing all this `-i --write-info-json --extract-audio --audio-quality 192K --audio-format mp3`, i think you should type `yt-dlp -F <URL>`
[22:47:15] <mago> Thats the command im running, the issue is with the last flag --postprocessor-args
[22:47:40] <tar_xvf> and in the dropdown list find which format is audio only and best quality
[22:47:42] <mago> Will that give me 192k and 44100 sample rate mp3 fil?
[22:47:52] <tar_xvf> then you do `yt-dlp -f <FORMAT> <URL>`
[22:48:02] <mago> I think i tried that but the file format i want is not on the list..
[22:48:10] <mago> Let me try your way though..
[22:48:50] <tar_xvf> i just did `yt-dlp -F <URL` for a random youtube video and got a response of many lines including this one:
[22:48:52] <tar_xvf> 251 webm                 â”‚    1.00MiB  147k https â”‚ audio only        opus       147k 48000Hz medium, webm_dash
[22:48:56] <mago> ALready did that with --list-formats
[22:49:23] <mago> My command works except by the arg supplied to --postprocessor-args
[22:49:35] <mago> Need help supplying the right arg to convert to 44100 sample rate..
[22:49:40] <mago> HELP SOS please
[22:50:06] <tar_xvf> i don't know how to help there, but you could always convert it to 44.1kHz after downloading with ffmpeg
[22:50:53] <mago> I could, but i want to streamline my work process with one commnad like i had until youtube-dl broke
[22:53:08] <mago> The help section of yt-dlp says that format --postprocessor-args NAME:ARGS 
[22:53:11] <mago> Any help appreciated
[22:55:03] <mago> Im guessing something like that:
[22:55:16] <mago> --postprocessor-args ffmpeg: something here..
[22:56:17] <mago> --postprocessor-args ffmpeg: -ar 44100
[23:03:13] <mago> How do you interrupt the command in terminal?
[23:05:00] <mago> Ctrl+C is not working? Whats up?
[23:07:29] <mago> Ok, cant interrupt command thats really annoying..
[23:18:23] <mago> That comes straight from the github, can someone help me make it work?:
