[05:03:52] <twrk> not really... company mode is really aggressive in popping up autocomplete and sometimes errors and overwrites a whole section... popping up with documentation is nice in theory but I haven't put it in a sensible place (since it pops up in the minibuffer)... flycheck is nice, but on my lappy tappy it feels like lsp and what it brings to c++ slows down the editing experience
[05:04:24] <twrk> probably primarily not lsp's fault but ¯\(°_o)/¯

[08:35:59] <homerj> I had a couple various macs over the years, always ended up with crappy keyboards
[08:36:05] <bpalmer> junebug: so, there are two possibilities: one is that your part of configuration that sets it is never being evaluated (possibly an error above it?), or something is resetting it
[08:36:11] <homerj> my iBook G4 was probably the worst

[08:36:47] <bpalmer> junebug: to check the first, introduce a syntax error right below it in your config and start up emacs with --debug-init and see if you get the error you're expecting. (Or, similarly, insert a (message "ladada") and then check the *Message* buffer)

[08:42:59] <bpalmer> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah, I'm pretty sure I did and they were decent, but not better than the macbook air; the other reason I stayed away from Lenovo is some friends were having issues with them sleeping when their lids closed

[08:44:15] <bpalmer> solid, good click sound, good travel distance, a good size.
[08:44:58] <bpalmer> junebug: ok. This is at least suggestive that the mode is doing it directly rather than respecting some kind of per file style.
[08:46:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I've pretty much always relied on software hibernate instead of sleep. Too dependent on firmware being non-buggy and exposing interfaces that may or may not even be documented..

[08:49:28] <bpalmer> junebug: they probably have their own settings, and may have heuristics to, e.g., guess how many indentation levels the current file is in.
[08:50:08] <bpalmer> Some people always want 2 spaces; some people want 2 spaces unless the file already uses 4 spaces; some people want 2 spaces for anything under proj1, 4 for anything under proj2; and finally some people do the right thing and use 8 column tabs.
[08:50:33] <junebug> Right. It should be up to the user
[08:50:53] <bpalmer> but different modes have different ways of doing things. 
[08:50:56] <junebug> Is ther any way I can set that value whenever a file is opened with a .js extension?
[08:51:15] <bpalmer> And it's complicated because there are multiple possible javascript modes people can use
[08:51:41] <bpalmer> junebug: you can put any of your mode settings in a function that you then attach to a hook, which is run at the very end of a major mode's set up.
[08:51:58] <bpalmer> for example, if you use js-mode , add the function to js-mode-hook.
[08:52:09] <bpalmer> it looks like you're using js2-mode , so probably js2-mode-hook
[08:52:38] <junebug> bpalmer, I've only been using emacs for a month. Can you link me to something that explains how to do this in detail?
[08:52:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> One benefit of WebAssembly will be that LLVM's wasm target will give Clasp free JS support better than Parenscript.

[08:53:49] <bpalmer> (defun junebug/set-javascript-style () (setq js-indent-level 2)) <-- first, you define a function that does all the setqs you want.
[08:54:02] <junebug> ok
[08:54:09] <bpalmer> (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'junebug/set-javascript-style)  <-- you add it to the mode hook
[08:54:17] <junebug> ok
[08:54:18] <bpalmer> maybe insert a message inside that set-javascript-style function so you know it ran.
[08:54:26] <junebug> Thank you
[08:54:46] <bpalmer> then, open a javascript file that you hadn't opened before and see if your function on the hook was executed. If not, you probably have the wrong hook.
[08:55:04] <junebug> Testing now
[08:55:12] <bpalmer> by convention, a major mode named "foo-mode" will have a hook named "foo-mode-hook" that it runs as the very last thing, so users can do things.

[10:54:57] <bpalmer> gko: M-x toggle-truncate-lines RET and it won't do that -- but then you won't be able to select the characters that go offscreen
[10:55:24] <epony> also sparc64 have many-core CPUs for quite some time too, but they just are not x86 and the applications are targeting x86 for servers up to now.. software has become more portable, but browsers disagree
[10:55:32] <bpalmer> gko: most editors nowadays don't really work in textual/non-graphical mode
[10:55:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hash: Are they really?
[10:55:39] <gko> bpalmer: Yes, but the point is to copy the whole lines!
[10:56:10] <epony> yes, arm has the chance to compete in many-core CPUs but they are smaller throughput and lower efficiency (higher cost)
[10:56:16] <bpalmer> gko: right. So what do other editors do in a purely textual environment? If they don't show a continuation character, then it looks like it's two different lines
[10:56:43] <gko> bpalmer: for example, with vi?
[10:56:56] <epony> the mobile and embedded sectors have shrunk the web programming to micro-services and bit flipping
[10:57:03] <bpalmer> gko: what does it do?

[10:57:47] <Hash> Aurora_v_kosmose: yes
[10:57:58] <Hash> I think Oracle has a lot of them so they give out the free ampere instance
[10:58:07] <Hash> I think also a few sites online said so, I read it.
[10:58:19] <bpalmer> gko: is it paying attention to the mouse itself, or simply presenting text? How does it disambiguate two lines from one?
[10:58:21] <epony> so many-core CPUs "serving from RAM" are the upcoming deployments (however the ecnomic effect is not there, single vendor / low output rates of production / higher cost and conversion times)
[10:58:28] <Hash> I dunno how true that is, but they said that arm/ampere 80-120 core cpu are good for cheap hosting
[10:58:55] <Hash> You can get a few of the cpus in a board, with couple of TB of ram
[10:59:05] <Hash> setup a hosting company based on that maybe
[10:59:09] <Hash> Oracle does it
[10:59:11] <epony> maybe, Oracle bought the Sunmicro properties and the sparc64 chips are in their control now
[10:59:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Very expensive though.
[10:59:22] <epony> yes, very very expensive
[10:59:27] <Hash> well yeah for them

[11:00:36] <gko> bpalmer: I just open vi, insert a long line and copy with mouse and it's OK if I paste somewhere else (whole long line copied)
[11:00:41] <epony> we're already up to 1-4TB RAM for x86 servers, but the costs are high for the CPUs (for both Amd and Intel)
[11:01:04] <bpalmer> gko: I suspect it's handling the mouse action itself. Try with xterm mouse mode and see if emacs does what you want any better.
[11:01:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ampere's CPU is still hardly cheap, but you also need boards compatible with them.
[11:01:05] <epony> and RAM modules are expensive too, at that density
[11:01:22] <bpalmer> gko: note that you *can* mess around with the \ display ; I'm not positive if setting that to an empty vector would work.
[11:01:53] <epony> so, it's limited to HPC and DB sectors (utility computing)
[11:02:27] <epony> (supercomputers and large cluster installations)
[11:03:41] <epony> for the server market (what gets deployed in businesses and data centres).. it's twin and dual / multi-systems in a chassis that realise the density
[11:04:47] <gko> bpalmer: but if I copy one long line (spreading two rows), it's still copied as separated lines
[11:04:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> An ARM server, at current time, costs more than a small car.
[11:05:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gko: That's your terminal interacting with your clipboard.

[11:25:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And disabling forwarding in ssh is not of any real use, you can simply run netcat on the other end.

[13:33:26] <thblt> Except terminal editors in screen or tmux.
[13:33:34] <ArneBab> Yes, the issue is bad, if you use emacs client
[13:34:10] <ArneBab> You can have an emacs server start at system start and then open that again whenever you switch to a new login

[13:37:36] <thblt> How?
[13:37:43] <ArneBab> it looks worse
[13:37:52] <ArneBab> does it have gtk icons in emacs buffers?
[13:37:57] <aidalgol> For all the problems there are with the way the GTK project is run, I cannot really fault them for not considering this *extremely niche* edge case a high priority.
[13:38:38] <ArneBab> so could those who don’t care just stop saying "maybe you should not care"? I understand where you’re coming from, but this is not helpful.
[13:38:43] <aidalgol> You're asking for a graphical application to survive the death of the graphical login session.
[13:38:47] <ArneBab> yes
[13:39:06] <ArneBab> just like screen does
[13:39:13] <kilobug> I mostly use gtk emacs for better integration with copy-paste with other programs, and occasionally displaying images in gnus
[13:39:20] <aidalgol> I do not know of any application that does this.  Probably because when you have bigger problems when that happens.
[13:39:27] <thblt> ArneBab: nobody said you shouldn't care, what we're saying is that you overestimate the severity of the issue.
[13:39:37] <aidalgol> ArneBab: If you want screen but for X, then you want Xpra.
[13:39:40] <kilobug> ArneBab: which is exactly xpra's purpose, IMHO it's not a problem on Gtk or Emacs side, but not using the proper tool (xpra)
[13:39:44] <ArneBab> thblt: and I’m telling you that for me this is severe
[13:39:54] <ArneBab> xpra has other issues
[13:39:55] <aidalgol> Expecting each application to handle this itself is asking a bit much.
[13:40:04] <ArneBab> xpra breaks colors
[13:40:16] <ArneBab> and the gtk bug is the only reason it does not work in emacs
[13:40:17] <thblt> kilobug: in all fairness *it's* a GTK bug.  See the warning at startup
[13:40:28] <artefact> does the daemon also die if you restart x? i'm not familiar with the bug
[13:40:39] <thblt> Since the daemon isn't graphical in itself, it *should* survive.
[13:40:46] <aidalgol> But also, this is a bug in *GTK*, not Emacs, so you're wasting your time here.

[17:03:10] <wasamasa> the first thing almost everyone customizing emacs does is disabling all the unneeded bars

[17:04:45] <rpav> you use it?
[17:05:25] <contrapunctus> wasamasa: hm...Emacs menus seem like menus in any other application. What kind of changes to them would you like?
[17:05:46] <contrapunctus> rpav: sometimes.
[17:06:12] <bremner> I also use the menu-bar, and even customize (gasp)
[17:06:20] <contrapunctus> ,shoot bremner 
[17:06:20] * fsbot` loads its IRC client and wastes the rest of bremner's day.
[17:06:39] <bremner> But I have only been using emacs for longer than most of the hipsters have been alive, so what do I know.
[17:06:49] <rpav> i use customize quite a bit .. i even use menus (at least ones i've generated), but i find the builtin stuff mostly useless

[17:08:53] <wasamasa> anyone can mess with it
[17:09:03] <wasamasa> it is not organized logically

[17:23:50] <wasamasa> as usual, it's idiotic
[17:24:20] <wasamasa> I'll have to add a workaround just because someone believes emacs menus to not completely suck
[17:25:25] <wasamasa> so, the problem is that usually, only one EPUB menu is displayed, unless the bug reporter opens an EPUB file (which I find hard to believe)
[17:25:34] <wasamasa> I can reproduce when I place point on a button/link
[17:26:03] <wasamasa> the reason being that this button/link contains a keymap containing the menu (because emacs had the grand idea to make menus keymaps)
[17:26:21] <wasamasa> so there's two keymaps associated with nov.el in effect, a global one and one at point
[17:26:39] <wasamasa> this is rendered as an EPUB menu containing two EPUB menus, each of which contains the actual menu

[18:54:11] <pingpongball> Hello guys
[18:54:15] <pingpongball> In emacs 29
[18:54:31] <pingpongball> What are those optional features?
[18:54:53] <patp> dired-listing-switching documentation says it must contain the l option. So I'm trying to figure out how can I get a shorter directory listing without all the permissons similar to ls -A?
[18:54:56] <pingpongball> What do you think should i enable those `optional features` that would really help emacs performance ?

[20:42:41] <johnjay__> wasamasa: it says here on reddit that Stefan wanted to have elpa packages come with emacs but also get updated. that was a few years ago. did that ever happen
[20:42:48] <wasamasa> no
[20:43:40] <johnjay__> maybe having it as a separate package would make sense. debian seems to love to segment things
[20:44:11] <bremner> johnjay__: what is "it" here? non-gnu elpa?
[20:44:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> johnjay__: For now elpa packages are also available separately for those who care.

[20:45:22] <johnjay__> ah i already closed the window. but i think it was the gnu parts of elpa

[21:02:43] <johnjay__> wouldn't guix be different for every distro though

[21:02:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That is not how it works.
[21:03:17] <johnjay__> because suse and debian might disagree about shell vars or paths. so guix would get it wrong if it worked on both

[21:09:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It won't add that many because in your current Guix profile's binary outputs it creates stub scripts that do all the gnarly work of making things work with the hashed paths for libraries. From the $GUIX_PROFILE only what you explicitly installed with the intent of it being visible is visible. So if you install gimp or whatever, only it is visible, its depedencies are hidden from view.
[21:09:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That comes in handy when you have packages with very specific lib requirements that may conflict with others.

[22:17:37] <bpalmer> go banana^Wchrome!
[22:17:40] <catern> does exwm merge firefox tabs into emacs buffers or something?
[22:17:45] <TRS-80> technomancy: It has been so long since I configured i3, I forget how defaults work, but maybe once you start a confing file they go away, or there is some easy way to blank them and start with your own

[22:18:16] <catern> sounds interesting

[22:18:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TRS-80: On Debian it just has a popup on first use that offers to generate a default config.
[22:18:44] <catern> https://mastodon.social/@ieure/103014001241428913
[22:18:49] <catern> very interesting and appealing
[22:18:50] <technomancy> catern: you can set it up that way so every tab is its own buffer but exwm's buffer switching was a bit too slow when I last tried it on my core 2 duo. it would probably work OK on modern hardware.
[22:19:18] <TRS-80> technomancy: I will give you that.  It's my one remaining pain point.  I have looked into various ways to re-map the keys in FF over the years but nothing stuck yet I guess (or I have yet to find Nirvana).

[22:23:21] <schmudde> sorry. it's a bit weird. I just want to move some elisp-generated ascii art around in a window.
[22:23:22] <bpalmer> schmudde: you can evaluate an expression via M-: or by having *scratch* or ielm open in another window/buffer
[22:23:31] <bpalmer> schmudde: window/frame, I mean.
[22:23:48] <aidalgol> Or C-x C-e anywhere.  Literally anywhere.
[22:23:59] <TRS-80> like with output to frame or something like that?

[22:24:14] <schmudde> Yeah, output to a frame.

[22:24:58] <catern> use threads??
[22:24:59] <fsbot`> Highly likely
[22:25:06] <catern> (elisp threads that is)
[22:25:07] <bpalmer> schmudde: it depends on how you're evaluating it. If you're using M-:  , the results of a form will by default be shown in the echo area. However, if your animation is using a timer/loop or thread, it will probably overwrite the echo area
[22:25:10] <aidalgol> ,shoot catern 
[22:25:10] * fsbot` loads its steak and asks catern how they would like it cooked.
[22:25:25] <catern> no, seriously, this would be a good use case for elisp threads!
[22:25:28] * aidalgol pulls out super shotgun and blows catern into giblets.
[22:25:30] <bpalmer> schmudde: on the other hand, ielm will show the result in the ielm buffer, beneath the form being evaluated.
[22:25:50] <schmudde> aniketgm: I'l try it using org-babel. I'm doing a lot of babel/clojure work already. Thanks!
[22:25:59] <bpalmer> schmudde: additionally, if you're not looking at the return value but you're calling some buffer modification (like insert, delete, etc), you have to pay attention to what buffer is active when your form is evaluated.
[22:26:07] <aniketgm> schmudde: you can create a split 'C-x 3' and then check the results there.
[22:26:11] <catern> maybe when I am the emacs maintainer at $POSSIBLENEWJOB I can improve threads to be even more cool and useful
[22:26:21] <schmudde> bpalmer: okay, that's helpful. I'm just kind of looking for hints on how Emacs evaulation works.

[22:30:09] <schmudde> TRS-80: right. I will. :) Forces me to learn a bit about how Emacs actually does eval.

[23:12:35] <krux02__> I currently just set them to nil when I encounter one.
[23:12:59] <krux02__> but that isn't covering, would like to know if there is an easier (single setting) way to do it.
[23:13:14] <TRS-80> krux02__: Use vanilla Emacs?
[23:13:22] <catern> got 'em
[23:13:38] <TRS-80> alternatively, the setting you seek being -q on command line ;)
[23:13:51] <krux02__> TRS-80, technically that is correct, but it would als disable all the advantages that I see in doom emacs.
[23:13:53] <aniketgm> krux02__: or disable evil.
[23:13:55] <artefact> just don't press those keys? sounds like x-y problem
[23:14:00] <greenline> yeah isn't that just evil mode?
[23:14:29] <davemq> Yeah, that's what I did when I started using Doom Emacs. Probably one of the *first* things I did
[23:14:35] <aniketgm> artefact: LMAO :D

[23:15:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> One of Async's major faults is the lack of a proper message passing API. It's fully callback -based
[23:15:58] <krux02__> I prefer if 'insert mode) is pretty much like vanilla emacs
[23:16:23] <artefact> many of the emacs distros are very opinionated. some aren't as much, like prelude
[23:16:43] <catern> Aurora_v_kosmose: use pipes to communicate with the other emacs processes
[23:16:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> catern: That's the kind of crappy leaky abstractions I'd expect from C
[23:16:58] <artefact> i think defaulting to vim keys shows you really don't care about non qwerty layouts much
[23:17:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> catern: Also that requires me to manually serialize/deserialize.
[23:17:42] <aniketgm> krux02__: literally my first result: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41980128/emacs-evil-mode-how-to-remap-hjkl
[23:17:57] <catern> Aurora_v_kosmose: that's fine, custom protocols for each use case is a reasonable option
[23:18:19] <catern> also, this is a lisp so uh
[23:18:27] <catern> serialization/deserialization is not exactly hard :)
[23:18:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There are proper CSP implementations in CL
[23:18:53] <greenline> aniketgm: nobody's perfect ;-)
[23:18:54] <catern> nothing wrong with sending sexps around
[23:20:07] <krux02__> aniketgm, yea it doesn't answer the question, but thank you for the effort
[23:20:34] <krux02__> it is not about 'doom' it is about evil-mode
[23:20:56] <krux02__> doom emacs goes a few steps ahead and puts those hjkl keys in as many places as possible
[23:21:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> catern: Message length is an issue as well. Just going (read *some-stream*) is going to block forever.

[23:22:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> catern: But in any case, all of that should be part of a single operation. (fiber-create #'some-fun args). With channels as a different thing entirely.
[23:23:07] <greenline> This is the sin of vim that I always bring up: it mixes positional (hjkl) and semantic (i, o, a, etc.) keybindings.

[23:38:09] <catern> Aurora_v_kosmose: to a degree, but if you're thinking of supporting full-fledged introduction https://catern.com/introduction.html it's tricky no matter how you do it
[23:38:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So passing an array of channels (as pipes) to a remote process seems... difficult.

[23:39:02] <catern> and you can multiplex on that
[23:39:19] <catern> passing more channels, who needs it? you can multiplex on the pair of channels you have
[23:39:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why use a star topology for message passing when you could notco?

[23:39:46] <catern> star vs not is something different
[23:40:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Multiplexing requires you do use some silly hacks like attaching channel IDs to messages instead of properly being able to address them.
[23:40:40] <catern> but, you can start emacs as a subprocess on a remote host B such that it connects to other remote host C over SSL and reads/writes things, if you like
