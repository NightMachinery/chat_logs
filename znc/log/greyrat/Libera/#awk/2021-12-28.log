[16:24:01] <pagios> hello, i  have a file that  has a certain pattern,  i am greeing on smbPassword:      and want to get that line and the line+5 underneath it , how can i easily do that  tried grep -A5 it takes lineX,2,3,4,5 , i need only LineX and Line 5 to be printed out
[16:24:08] <pagios> bash or awk quesiton ? not sure
[16:31:59] <Patsie> awk '/smbPassword:/ { cnt=5; print } { cnt-- } (cnt == 1)'
[16:32:03] <Patsie> something like that
[16:36:19] <pagios> Patsie: amazing, it works but i have some palse positivees, can i for example print the lineX and the FIRST NEXT marching line that starts with " mail: "   
[16:36:31] <pagios> instead of line numbers coz some fields have extra lines

[17:04:24] <pagios> emanuele6: should i ask here and stick here?
[17:04:59] <emanuele6> pagios: awk '!mail && /^mail:/ { print; mail = 1 } !pass && !/^smbPassword:/ { print; pass = 1 } pass && mail { exit }'
[17:05:22] <emanuele6> or if you want the first mail and the password after rather than the first match of either:
[17:05:54] <emanuele6>   awk '!mail && /^mail:/ { print; mail = 1 } mail && !/^smbPassword:/ { print; exit }'

[17:06:30] <emanuele6> pagios: awk '!mail && /^mail:/ { print; mail = 1 } !pass && /^smbPassword:/ { print; pass = 1 } pass && mail { exit }'
[17:07:21] <emanuele6> i feel like i am messing something up, sorry
[17:07:43] <pagios> emanuele6: i found an easier pattern
[17:07:56] <emanuele6> oh, nevermind, the example you provided does not contain smbPassword
[17:08:05] <pagios> match "mailDeliveryAddress" and then match the next line that starts with smbPassword: 
[17:08:18] <pagios> no more mail: multiple entries
[17:08:39] <emanuele6> pagios: https://pastebin.com/raw/fw3rDUeL
[17:08:44] <emanuele6> you gave me this example
[17:08:50] <emanuele6> there is no "smbPassword"...
[17:08:58] <pagios> userPassword
[17:09:25] <pagios> i changed some stuff for security .... sorry
[17:10:23] <pagios> emanuele6:  here is an updated one: https://pastebin.com/xWyJ1HjN.  need line 4 and line 20
[17:11:26] <emanuele6> yeah, what i sent just now, no?
[17:12:32] <pagios> emanuele6:  cat users.ldap | awk '!mail && /^MailDeliveryAddress:/ { print; mail = 1 } !pass && /^userPassword:/ { print; pass = 1 } pass && mail { exit }'.  <-- works for 1 entry only, i need it to get the rest
[17:12:51] <emanuele6> what does that mean?
[17:13:03] <pagios> if i have 100 entries, it is getting the first entry
[17:13:18] <pagios> what i pasted is 1 record in pastebin
[17:13:23] <pagios> i have 100 similar ones in that file
[17:13:41] <emanuele6> all you changed in the new pastebin is that there is now "mailDeliveryAddress: test@domain.com" at line 3
[17:13:42] <pagios> excuse my enflish
[17:13:44] <emanuele6> nothing else changed
[17:14:05] <pagios> emanuele6: yes in the pastebin it is 1 record,    i have 100 similar ones
[17:14:08] <pagios> in the same file
[17:14:28] <pagios> not exactly similar, with different userPassword, maildelivery Address etc
[17:14:31] <emanuele6> i will guess you want:
[17:14:33] <emanuele6>   awk '!mail && /^mail:/ { print; mail = 1 } mail && /^userPassword:/ { print; mail = 0 }'
[17:14:37] <emanuele6> but i have no idea
[17:15:03] <emanuele6> and if that is what you want, sed could have done it
[17:15:10] <pagios> yeses :) 
[17:15:12] <pagios> bingo!
[17:17:02] <pagios> emanuele6:  you rock man!
[17:17:09] <pagios> thanks a lot , ninja
[17:19:50] <emanuele6> pagios: but really what is even the point of that?
[17:20:06] <emanuele6> oh, nevermind i forgot
[17:20:54] <emanuele6> i brain farted, i was going to say: "why not just `grep -e ^mail: -e ^userPassword:'" :P

[17:24:35] <emanuele6> pagios: if you want to avoid printing an extra /^mail:/ at the end if there is no matching /^smbPassword:/, use:
[17:25:10] <emanuele6>   awk '!mail && /^mail:/ { mail = $0 } mail && /^userPassword:/ { print mail; print; mail = "" }'
