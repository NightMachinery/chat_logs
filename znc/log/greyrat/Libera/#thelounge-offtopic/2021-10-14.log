[10:49:42] <bookworm> you can change the owner on npm if needed. For the shortcuts plugin I simply got push access to the repo and for know the GitHub action still push the package to npm

[20:57:22] <Activ8> I have two themes.  I need new names for them.  Anyone got any suggestions?
[20:57:31] <Activ8> Dark Theme: https://github.com/aab12345/thelounge-theme-ocuk-dark
[20:57:46] <Activ8> Blue Theme - https://github.com/aab12345/thelounge-theme-ocuk-blue
[20:58:30] <Activ8> If anyone has any ideas I will put your name in the project as the name chooser.  I feel the current titles need a change ready for 4.3.0
[20:58:46] <Activ8> specifically I want to remove the ocuk part 
[21:01:13] <xnaas> "My Dark Theme" and "My Blue Theme" /s
[21:01:55] <xnaas> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aab12345/thelounge-theme-ocuk-dark/master/Screenshots/Screenshot1.png looks "flat" in design...maybe include the words "flat" and "dark" in the title? dunno
[21:02:23] <Activ8> could be an option
[21:02:39] <Activ8> thelounge-theme-flat-blue and thelounge-theme-flat-dark
[21:06:52] <mooff> lovely
[21:07:02] <mooff> more of you folks should share themes, imo
[21:07:16] <bookworm> there's only one theme, gruvbox
[21:07:36] <bookworm> everywhere ;P vim, mutt, terminal, WM
[21:07:47] <mooff> bookworm: that explains a lot!! :D>
[21:07:48] <Activ8> that's the problem, everyone want's a different theme
[21:08:03] <Activ8> I love the default ones but at the time I needed to make a new dark and blue theme to match some project
[21:08:04] <mooff> !sr everybody wants to rule the world
[21:08:04] <wendy> mooff: Error: "sr" is not a valid command.
[21:08:06] <bookworm> https://git.labrat.space/thelounge-theme-gruvbox/
[21:08:21] <bookworm> needs some changes for the mew features
[21:09:01] <Activ8> I need to start my theme changes for 4.3.0
[21:09:55] <xnaas> I use Solarized (dark) in most places.
[21:10:12] <xnaas> Though, 05brown being pink in thelounge's solarized theme is...not accurate lol
[21:10:16] <xnaas> funny, but...not right

[21:16:22] <xnaas> One of them got deleted, I guess, and thelounge upgrade started to throw errors, so I just removed it.
[21:16:40] <Activ8> waaaaaaaaaaaaa
[21:17:08] <Activ8> where you getting 80 themes from the npm doesn't have 80
