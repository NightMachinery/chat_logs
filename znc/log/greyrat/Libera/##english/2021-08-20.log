[03:13:30] <CuriosTiger> dTal: Depends on what you're shooting with.
[03:13:42] <dTal> CuriosTiger: does it?
[03:13:48] <CuriosTiger> The most common meanings would be either to fire a bullet or to take a photo.
[03:13:50] <CuriosTiger> Yes, it does.
[03:14:22] <dTal> What do bullets and photos have in common, that they warrant the same word?
[03:14:43] <dTal> I'm specifically curious about what makes shooting shooting
[03:14:50] <CuriosTiger> Both involve aiming at something and triggering an action.
[03:15:06] <tinwhiskers> the verb for photography was borrowed from the firearm verb
[03:15:14] <CuriosTiger> but as for why we call it shooting, I think it's because "barking" was already taken.
[03:15:19] <dTal> for instance, if I attack you with a gun or a bow, that's shooting. But if I throw a spear, that's not shooting.
[03:15:36] <dTal> The triggering aspect is interesting.
[03:15:38] <CuriosTiger> dTal: Are you asking for a logical explanation for arbitrary distinctions made by language?
[03:15:48] <dTal> Yep! Proudly :D
[03:15:56] <CuriosTiger> In other languages, "shooting" may not be used for photography.

[03:17:03] <CuriosTiger> dTal: Why do we look for patterns instead of see for patterns?
[03:17:12] <CuriosTiger> We already have a perfectly good verb for using our eyes.
[03:17:17] <tinwhiskers> that some things are just so stories does not mean all stories are uninteresting. talk about reductio

[03:18:14] <dTal> they aren't the same thing either - you can look for something and not see it.

[03:21:16] <dTal> see, why is firing an arrow "shooting" but not launching a spear with an atlatl? Is firing a rock with a slingshot shooting? It has word "shot" in it so it seems so
[03:21:45] <CuriosTiger> I'd say you shoot a catapult.
[03:22:00] <CuriosTiger> "shoot" doesn't really apply to spears, because you're not so much triggering an action as just throwing the damn thing.
[03:22:17] <tinwhiskers> I'd say fire a catapult but shoot works
[03:22:38] <CuriosTiger> tinwhiskers: but unlike igniting gunpowder, no literal fire is involved there.
[03:22:53] <dTal> But a slingshot is very much like an atlatl, and an atlatl is very much like just throwing a spear.
[03:22:53] <CuriosTiger> Not really with cameras either, although with old-style camera flashes, that's arguable.
[03:22:58] <tinwhiskers> fair

[03:35:21] <dTal> hah! Merriam Webster: to eject or impel or cause to be ejected or impelled by a sudden release of tension (as of a bowstring or slingshot or by a flick of a finger
[03:35:43] <dTal> so indeed it is "triggering something"! well done
[03:36:04] * CuriosTiger bows
[03:37:32] <StayHungry> marianne: about dull -> https://youtu.be/PCoyTwltu5g?t=195
[03:37:34] <dTal> so, "shoot" involves a particular energy profile - a long buildup, a delay of indeterminate time, followed by quick release
[03:37:55] <tinwhiskers> well, that's all good in theory but actual people don't follow such rules.
[03:38:12] <dTal> au contraire, they do without realizing it
[03:38:29] <tinwhiskers> One particular variant will dominate often for no good reason.
[03:38:44] <dTal> why did the person who decided to apply "shoot" to photography think that made sense?
[03:38:57] <tinwhiskers> different people choose all sorts of different phrases and some just stick
[03:39:10] <dTal> in the general case, how do words get expanded?
[03:39:17] <dTal> People extrapolate.
[03:39:20] <tinwhiskers> it often doesn't follow rules 
[03:39:33] <dTal> People intuit the underlying rule, and apply it.
[03:39:52] <tinwhiskers> sometimes... sure. But language *is* more fluid than that
[03:39:56] <dTal> Even if there wasn't one to start with, there will be after a few rounds of that.
[03:40:45] <dTal> language has a colossal amount of largely undocumented structure of this kind, and I'm interested in it
[03:40:46] <tinwhiskers> yes, one will come to dominate, regardless of whether it fits one rule or another
[03:41:14] <dTal> you're too quick to reject that there might actually be a rule
[03:41:31] <tinwhiskers> there are general rules that people often follow but they are not as strict as you seem to think
[03:41:44] <dTal> it's the same with grammar - there are idioms and exceptions everywhere, but there *is* a regular grammar
[03:42:08] <tinwhiskers> yeah, sure. but if you think all words follow such rules you're dreaming
[03:42:18] <dTal> I don't think I ever said that.
[03:43:10] <tinwhiskers> ok, so we agree then
[03:43:23] <dTal> I asked what the connection was between things that shoot, because I could intuit that there *was* a connection but couldn't put my finger on what it was.
[03:43:23] <tinwhiskers> it's more like trends and guidelines than rules
[03:43:27] <LjL> i sometimes try to figure out the "meaning" of adverbial/prepositional/whatever parts of phrasal verbs, as i sometimes get an intuition that it *is* the same rough meaning for the same particle in disparate verbs, but it's very hard to pinpoint exactly
[03:43:59] <LjL> dTal, i think that shooting photographies may have been an extension from there being a "trigger" in both guns and cameras
[03:44:00] <dTal> and it turns out the connection is actually highly abstract
[03:44:11] <dTal> which I find fascinating
[03:44:49] <dTal> LjL: maybe, or maybe it runs deeper
[03:45:17] <dTal> science experiments involving the sudden release of large amounts of energy describe them as "shots"
[03:45:50] <LjL> what about shots of alcohol
[03:46:10] <dTal> I would be very surprised if that were related.
[03:46:15] <LjL> and should i have some
[03:46:26] <dTal> No you should not.
[03:46:32] <LjL> boo :(
[03:46:43] <dTal> I'm not gonna be an enabler!
[03:46:59] <tinwhiskers> In early America when we still hunted our meals regularly, a small glass would be left on dinner tables at each table setting in which guests could place the lead shot or buckshot that may still be in their meals, eventually leading to the coining of the term "shot glass."
[03:47:07] <tinwhiskers> err, that was a quote
[03:47:16] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Shots of alcohol certainly involve the sudden release of a large amount of energy.

[03:47:26] <CuriosTiger> just down your throat rather than for combustion.
[03:47:28] <tinwhiskers> heh
[03:47:32] <LjL> that's what i thought
[03:47:35] <CuriosTiger> but, I mean, there's a reason alcohol is used as fuel.
[03:47:57] <CuriosTiger> (It's probably also the only fuel that *is* meant for human consumption. :P )
[03:48:34] <marianne> Is true
[03:48:43] <marianne> Norwegians mix vodka with coffee?
[03:48:47] <marianne> Can't imagine the trip
[03:48:48] <LjL> CuriosTiger, forcefully meant... humans started consuming alcohol and at first they couldn't really metabolize it without high toxicity. over time, evolution make it so we metabolize it with only moderate toxicity.
[03:48:57] <dTal> there's this loosely connected semantic web, and as we crawl around it we might find ourselves in a different sense of the word
[03:48:58] <marianne> I cannot have any alcohol any time soon
[03:49:03] <marianne> So I can only imagine
[03:49:04] <tinwhiskers> yeah, aside from carbs, fats and keytones, it's the only other energy source we use
[03:49:14] <CuriosTiger> marianne: I didn't drink when I lived in Norway and I don't drink coffee, so I wouldn't know.
[03:49:18] <tinwhiskers> (actually there's a bunch of others too)
[03:49:26] <dTal> tinwhiskers: it's a caarb isn't it?
[03:49:37] <tinwhiskers> hrm. is it?
[03:49:40] <marianne> CuriosTiger: lovely, I'm a huge organic tea fan but my ex boyfriend was a tea lover and a coffee lover Idk what to do
[03:49:45] <CuriosTiger> I still don't drink much, but I'll have a cocktail every once in a while.
[03:49:49] <marianne> I guess I'll go back to soda
[03:49:55] <CuriosTiger> I drink Dr Pepper. That's my vice.
[03:50:03] <marianne> Oh nice!
[03:50:03] <dTal> ah no it's not
[03:50:07] <marianne> We don't have that here.
[03:50:12] <tinwhiskers> Alcohol counts as zero carbs but does have calories
[03:50:12] <LjL> i am a serial mint eater as a replacement for my previous smoking.
[03:50:13] <dTal> but it metabolizes into it
[03:50:19] <dTal> it turns into sugar
[03:50:19] <tinwhiskers> ah
[03:50:25] <CuriosTiger> Norway didn't either. But when I moved to the US and discovered Dr Pepper for the first time, it was game over.
[03:50:25] <marianne> I had machiatto today, terrible
[03:50:30] <tinwhiskers> really... that's odd
[03:50:32] <LjL> macchiato*
[03:50:44] <LjL> unless you meant it was terrible by virtue of the misspelling
[03:50:45] <marianne> Grazie!
[03:50:48] <LjL> prego!
[03:50:57] <CuriosTiger> (Nowadays, you can find Dr Pepper at 7-11 in Norway. But when I was growing up, we didn't have 7-11 either.)
[03:51:09] <marianne> Italian is really my weak spot, much appreciated [2]
[03:51:13] <dTal> ...ah, nope, that's a cached thought that Google tells me isn't true
[03:51:14] <tinwhiskers> alcohol is not meant to count toward any carbs in a diet (just calories) so metabolising to carbs seems contrary to that
[03:51:28] <CuriosTiger> tinwhiskers: Says who?
[03:51:42] <marianne> My last shots of vodka included french syrup green apple, cotton candy
[03:51:44] <marianne> JEsus
[03:51:49] <marianne> mid january
[03:51:51] <marianne> That was it
[03:51:55] <dTal> but it does raise your blood sugar, so by definition it must turn into sugar
[03:52:00] <CuriosTiger> I mean, it metabolizes to sugar
[03:52:05] <CuriosTiger> but things like beer certainly contain carbs
[03:52:21] <marianne> I hate beer fortunately
[03:52:29] <CuriosTiger> Me too.
[03:52:31] <marianne> I don't like wine either but vodka with fruit juice </3
[03:52:32] <tinwhiskers> yes, beer has plenty of carbs. Metabolising into carbs seems wrong to me.
[03:52:37] <CuriosTiger> People tell me beer is an acquired taste. I never acquired it.
[03:52:53] <marianne> Same for black coffee.
[03:52:57] <marianne> Not my thing either.
[03:52:57] <StayHungry> are there any non-drinkers here besides me? :)
[03:53:00] <CuriosTiger> I never acquired that one either.
[03:53:05] <tinwhiskers> I'm a non-drinker
[03:53:16] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: I was ~35 when I started drinking alcohol.

[03:53:31] <tinwhiskers> :-)
[03:53:41] <CuriosTiger> At this point, I have...perhaps 10 drinks per year?
[03:53:49] <CuriosTiger> usually when going out with friends.
[03:53:58] <tinwhiskers> yeah, I might stretch to about that many too
[03:54:03] <marianne> I'm happy with pineapple with lemon / coconut with pineapple green tea but...the organic shop is so cool
[03:54:08] <marianne> Endless choices
[03:54:11] <marianne> My heart is there

[03:54:25] <CuriosTiger> drilling a hole in a coconut and putting a straw in.
[03:54:28] <CuriosTiger> so refreshing.
[03:54:50] <marianne> Coconut water? I have that whenever I'm extremely dehydrated
[03:54:59] <marianne> My dad used to drink it a lot
[03:55:06] <tinwhiskers> yeah, coconuts are awesome.
[03:55:10] * StayHungry recalls the last time drinking alcohol... Glühwein... in spring of... 2009
[03:55:13] <marianne> Yes right from the coconut
[03:55:15] <LjL> the web is telling me that the metabolism of ethanol Is Complicated
[03:55:17] <CuriosTiger> I've planted coconut palms around my property
[03:55:28] <marianne> the crap they sell here in bottles is expensive and taste awful
[03:55:34] <CuriosTiger> Can't wait for them to actually produce coconuts.
[03:55:37] <marianne> Dad had those too in his house
[03:55:46] <tinwhiskers> CuriosTiger: awesome!
[03:55:46] <marianne> Have fun, good times!
[03:56:03] <CuriosTiger> I also planted bananas and starfruit. And I have a mango tree.
[03:56:05] <CuriosTiger> <3 Florida
[03:56:09] <tinwhiskers> wicked
[03:56:13] <StayHungry> there was a time... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement_in_the_United_States
[03:56:16] <tinwhiskers> did you get dwarf coconuts?
[03:56:27] <CuriosTiger> My coconut palms are too small to produce fruit so far.
[03:56:30] <marianne> Mangoes are great yes, I do not know starfruits and I don't like bananas
[03:56:40] <CuriosTiger> starfruit is also called carambola
[03:56:41] <marianne> I'm a huge strawberry, tangerine and green grapes fan.
[03:56:46] <marianne> Ahhhh takk :)
[03:56:49] <marianne> flott!
[03:57:01] <CuriosTiger> I'm a fan of grapes, strawberries, but even more so raspberries
[03:57:07] <CuriosTiger> and Rainier cherries. Those are awesome.
[03:57:14] <tinwhiskers> I planted some dwarf coconuts. Normal coconuts take about 10-15 years to grow large enough to fruit, but dwarf coconuts will fruit after only 5 years and you can reach the coconuts from the ground for the first 5 years.
[03:57:18] <marianne> oohhh before I got sick mid march I got addicted to blueberry tea.
[03:57:21] <marianne> Damn good too.
[03:57:37] <CuriosTiger> tinwhiskers: Nice. I think mine are of the normal kind, so I may be in for a long wait. :(
[03:57:44] <tinwhiskers> :-(
[03:57:57] <CuriosTiger> I don't actually know -- they were gifted to me as saplings.
[03:58:05] <CuriosTiger> the tallest is about 7 feet now.
[03:58:14] <tinwhiskers> nice
[03:58:26] <CuriosTiger> I also got some Christmas palms and a single royal palm that are closer to 15'
[03:58:28] <tinwhiskers> how long ago did you plant them?
[03:58:37] <CuriosTiger> two years
[03:58:43] <StayHungry> LjL: so you dropped smoking?
[03:58:44] <tinwhiskers> oh, as saplings. right.
[03:58:50] <CuriosTiger> Yeah.
[03:59:06] <CuriosTiger> I mean, they're definitely growing.
[03:59:12] <LjL> StayHungry, several years ago
[03:59:13] <CuriosTiger> The bananas, though, are amazing.
[03:59:18] <StayHungry> LjL: bravo ,)
[03:59:21] <CuriosTiger> They were just cuttings. Maybe a foot tall, if that
[03:59:34] <CuriosTiger> In ONE year, they've grown twelve feet.
[03:59:34] <tinwhiskers> far too small :-)
[03:59:45] <CuriosTiger> Twelve. Feet!
[03:59:59] <CuriosTiger> (3.5 meters for the rest of the world.)

[04:00:13] <tinwhiskers> yeah, but that's far too small to move a banana. It slows things down dramatically.
[04:00:27] <tinwhiskers> My banansa were over 6 m tall in one year
[04:00:37] <tinwhiskers> maybe 5
[04:00:45] <CuriosTiger> tinwhiskers: Didn't know that. But the guy I got them from was going to throw them out, so I saved them.
[04:00:45] <tinwhiskers> really big.
[04:00:51] <tinwhiskers> Fair
[04:01:04] <CuriosTiger> and they look nice, although they shed A LOT of leaves.
[04:01:11] <CuriosTiger> I have to go out and clean them up every few weeks
[04:01:14] <CuriosTiger> worth it though.
[04:01:15] <tinwhiskers> If wait until the suckers are about 1-1.5m tall you'll halve the time for your next generation
[04:01:23] <CuriosTiger> Makes sense.
[04:01:26] <CuriosTiger> but they survived.
[04:01:31] <CuriosTiger> I'm more worried about my arecas
[04:01:37] <CuriosTiger> I tried planting an areca palm hedge
[04:01:46] <tinwhiskers> yeah, they can grow from tiny but it takes AGES without the additional nutrients from the parent root system
[04:01:49] <CuriosTiger> They have not really grown much. A few have shrunk. About five have died.
[04:01:56] <LuisP14> mm niceness
[04:02:00] <CuriosTiger> They really didn't like our drought over the winter. :-(
[04:02:32] <marianne> I don't know how

[04:02:58] <CuriosTiger> Nite
[04:03:00] <tinwhiskers> I had some bananas that were only about 30cm tall when planted and I had other bananasa complete 3 generations before they fruited. It makes a *massive* difference to fruiting time.

[04:51:08] <tinwhiskers> I'm sure much the same as everyone else. The world is populated by far more idiots than what I thought two years ago.

[06:16:50] <kurahaupo> tinwhiskers: NZ is clean for the same reason most islands are clean: the wind carries away any smog. And it's green because it rains enough to run mostly on hydro electricity (and to grow stuff year round)
[06:17:54] <tinwhiskers> yeah, it's reasonably green but not quite up to what you hear. We have poor water quality in many rivers due to agricultural runoff - can't even swim in many rivers now. That's not clean and green.
[06:18:04] <kurahaupo> That said, it's also clean because local govt employs people to tidy up. We don't tolerate city streets with piles of rubbish all the time
[06:18:15] <tinwhiskers> Our CO2 footprint per capita exceeds most first world countries - again mostly due to agriculture.
[06:19:38] <kurahaupo> I thought that wasn't CO₂ but rather methane which is a more potent greenhouse gas
[06:19:52] <tinwhiskers> yes, methane too
[06:20:17] <tinwhiskers> although looks like we'll have a solution to cow methane soon

[06:21:19] <tinwhiskers> Methane ultimately breaks down into CO2 where it remains, accounting for something like 25 times the potency as CO2 overall
[06:22:51] <tinwhiskers> there's a new vaccine in the works that causes cows to kill the methanogenic bacteria in their rumen. They remain productive but with no methane.
[06:22:58] <kurahaupo> CH₄ traos about 84× more heat than CO₂
[06:23:05] <kurahaupo> traps
[06:23:06] <tinwhiskers> ah. 84. ok
[06:23:47] <kurahaupo> When it breaks down, it's just CO₂ + 2H₂O
[06:24:11] <kurahaupo> Which takes about 10 years
[06:24:25] <tinwhiskers> anyway, lab-grown milk is only 10-15 years away (20-30 in bulk) so we can ditch dairy cattle then - they are far worse than raising beef
[06:25:31] <kurahaupo> some would argue that we can already get "milk" from soy or various nuts

[06:30:08] <tinwhiskers> that's not why they produce methane really.
[06:31:08] <tinwhiskers> There are bacteria that can digest cellulose, that cattle depend on for rumen function. Some of those bacteria produce methane in the process and some don't. It turns out you don't need the ones that produce methane, so we'll just get rid of those bacteria.

[07:53:16] <juliaEnv> Hi, I'm giving a testimonial and it's something I rarely do. Is my English correct? "Patrik is the best salesman I've worked with. He knows what works, and he is both book smart and street smart. People with these qualities tend to be the top performers in business. His customer-oriented approach by far exceeds customer expectations, like a 5 star hotel. Compared to other sales people, Patrik has a global business experience 
[07:53:16] <juliaEnv> from different countries in the world and he has been really working on self-development far beyond what most people do."
[07:55:55] <tinwhiskers> juliaEnv: grammatically it's fine.
[07:56:47] <juliaEnv> tinwhiskers thanks. Is there something apart from the grammar that isn't fine, for example a clumsy expression that a native speaker would write differently?
[07:56:55] <tinwhiskers> There's a few phrases I would personally change...

[07:59:42] <tinwhiskers> " People with these qualities tend to be the top performers in business" doesn't actually speak to the person you're making the testimonial for. Make it more directly about them.

[08:01:38] <tinwhiskers> I also don't particularly like the "like a 5 star hotel" but I think it's a good start that just needs some sort of tweak.
[08:02:37] *** Joins: jab416171 (~jab416171@c-174-52-176-66.hsd1.ut.comcast.net)
[08:02:55] <juliaEnv> tinwhiskers thanks for your opinions. I'll consider this useful criticism. I only don't see why you believe I don't make a comparison (I've compared my experience with this guy to my experience with other such guys)
[08:02:56] <tinwhiskers> but in saying all that, what you have will be understood by any reader so there's nothing that *needs* to be changed.
[08:02:56] <Samian> tinwhiskers I wish I was like you're. You have a steady mood. You're always helpful. You're always calm, cool, and collected. An easy going person. I wish I was like that
[08:04:10] <tinwhiskers> The "Compared with" sentence is the one that needs work the most I think.
[08:05:25] <tinwhiskers> It seems to be saying that no salespeople have global business experience except for Patrik, which is clearly an exageration.
[08:06:04] <tinwhiskers> You should really just be saying he has more experience than *most* salespeople.
[08:06:32] <juliaEnv> tinwhiskers I didn't write compared to all other sales people, but I wrote compared to other sales people. That is inteded to mean compared to other (usual) sales people 
[08:07:13] <tinwhiskers> Yeah, I'm sure that's what you intended, but I'm not so sure that's what it means.
[08:07:14] <juliaEnv> the "other" isn't specified (so it doesn't necessarily mean "all". It can be any group of "other")
[08:07:37] <juliaEnv> tinwhiskers lol, OK. I'll change that. Thanks a lot
[08:08:57] <tinwhiskers> How about changing it to something like "Compared to most other salespeople Patrik has a wealth of international sales experience, which makes him a valuable asset to any sales team".
[08:09:40] <tinwhiskers> or just drop the compared to part and just say "Patrik has a wealth of international sales experience, which makes him a valuable asset to any sales team".
[08:11:48] <juliaEnv> tinsoldier how about this? "tinwhiskers Patrik is the best salesman I've worked with. He knows what works, and he is both book smart and street smart. People with these qualities tend to be the top performers in business. His customer-oriented approach by far exceeds customer expectations. Patrik has a wealth of international sales experience, which makes him a valuable asset to any sales team. Every day, he spends time on 
[08:11:48] <juliaEnv> getting better, so I would also recommend him for an exceptional leadership."
[08:12:15] <tinwhiskers> honestly, if you use the term "street smart" half of your readers will take that to mean "idiot"
[08:13:19] <tinwhiskers> either him or you (the latter meaning your letter is massively devalued)
[08:15:59] <juliaEnv> tinwhiskers oh, I see. In business, many people are only book smart. If there is some crook from the street, he can easily rip them off. This guy has displayed the ability to deal with such cases effectively. Well, he does boxing, jogging, and recognizes unethical behavior and games some people play
[08:16:41] <juliaEnv> tinwhiskers so, he isn't fooled by various crooks, con artists, etc.
[08:16:55] <tinwhiskers> I know what they mean, but "street smart" has a reputation of being used by fools to excuse themselves from being stupid. And "book smart" is merely the partner terms that gives a similar impression.
[08:17:49] <juliaEnv> OK, I assumed book smart means knowledgable from reading books on business subjects and street smart means experienced in the field with real people in real business situations
[08:17:57] <tinwhiskers> use words like intelligent, well-educated, pragmatic, but never "book smart".
[08:18:11] <tinwhiskers> It does but it has a bad reputation so it's hit and miss
[08:18:19] <juliaEnv> is streetwise also bad?
[08:18:31] <tinwhiskers> it's not as bad
[08:18:38] <tinwhiskers> quite
[08:19:05] <juliaEnv> is "knowledgeable and streetwise" still bad?
[08:19:17] <tinwhiskers> it's a lot better

[08:20:22] <tinwhiskers> that phrase has been tarnished
[08:20:40] <pussipupu> just for completeness, "streetwise" reads as an error to me in that context
[08:20:43] <mihael> What's the right phrase for something that someone wants done or change before an event occurs. e.g. "I'll go ahead and delete these files unless . . ."
[08:20:47] <juliaEnv> right. I've seen for the first time what the definition of know-how is. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know-how
[08:21:09] <pussipupu> I only really know it as an adverb for "Street by street" 
[08:21:20] <juliaEnv> know-how is theoretical (from books) and practical (from the field)
[08:22:07] <juliaEnv> so, without using those 2 words that can sound like he's an idiot, the true intended meaning is that his know-how includes both the theory and the practice, I guess
[08:22:19] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[08:22:32] <tinwhiskers> !w pragmatic
[08:22:33] <tinsoldier> pragmatic — Noun: 1. A man of business., 2. A busybody., 3. A public decree., — Adjective: 1.

[08:22:51] <juliaEnv> yes, pragmatism is a practice-oriented action
[08:23:16] <juliaEnv> he is both theoretical and pragmatic
[08:23:27] <tinwhiskers> yeah...
[08:23:43] <tinwhiskers> that's why I said things like well-educated and pragmatic, or intelligent and pragmatic.
[08:23:47] <pussipupu> “He has both the theoretical knowledge and practical skill to excel in the field of tiger wrestling”
[08:23:53] <tinwhiskers> ie. both smart and practical

[17:36:52] <twb> Hrm, 65% of internet traffic is still IPv4.  I thought it was more like 45%
[17:38:01] <twb> 50% of websites are HTTP/1.1 only.  So HTTP/2 adoption is happening faster than IPv6.
