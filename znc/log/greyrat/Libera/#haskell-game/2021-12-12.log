[04:41:13] <EvanR> ok I found myself trying to avoid re-rendering something that has not changed
[04:42:12] <EvanR> Hashing? xD

[12:10:44] <ManofLetters[m]> what's your representation of a frame to render? e.g., "Vector of Char, 80x24"
[12:20:36] <f-a> diff the array, bro

[20:20:55] <EvanR> I don't have a representation
[20:21:45] <EvanR> I barely have anything but the means to blit texels on surface
[20:22:57] <EvanR> if a given "picture" had "state" type s... and we're trying to be polymorphic, you can't really do anything
[20:23:24] <f-a> I mean if all you print is chars, you should have some array/map/thingo
[20:23:37] <EvanR> unless you add some sort of fact to the type that helps detect that something changed
[20:23:44] <EvanR> such as Eq, but that seems too silly
[20:24:24] <EvanR> f-a, so far, I have one thingie that can show chars on a grid and another thing that can show sprites
[20:24:25] <f-a> but yeah seems useless enough, you should have plenty of speed by now
[20:24:36] <f-a> oh ohhh
[20:24:43] <EvanR> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/710644130048639066/919418665756160010/unknown.png
[20:25:10] <EvanR> two things, not sure how many more there'll be
[20:25:42] <f-a> are those from open game art?
[20:26:07] <f-a> write something outrageous instead of ‚Äú:D‚Äù
[20:26:15] <f-a> so I can comment: ‚ÄúNice edge, EvanR‚Äù
[20:27:02] <EvanR> hah
[20:28:14] <EvanR> yeah open game art
[20:28:23] <EvanR> and I got some sounds from freesound.org
[20:29:12] <EvanR> i can load short chunks and play them on top of each other, and stream long audio from a file
[20:37:19] <ManofLetters[m]> do you really not have a representation of a scene? Construct a scene, only then render it, then modify it, then render the modified version, etc.?
[20:37:46] <ManofLetters[m]> e.g., in your picture, you can have a list of coordinates and whats at the coordinate
[20:38:14] <f-a> or simply care not, gamemaking ‚â´ optimisations
[20:38:18] <ManofLetters[m]> which may be a text with given attributes, a sprite, anything warped a given graphical stransformation, etc.
[20:38:34] <f-a> Allure of the FPSs
[20:38:53] <ManofLetters[m]> a scene representation is good sanity, not just for speed
[20:39:03] <ManofLetters[m]> separate rendering from everything else
[20:39:11] <ManofLetters[m]> minimize code that lives in IO
[20:39:39] <f-a> yeah that is correct
[20:39:45] <f-a> sorry for my conspicuous trolling
[20:40:28] <EvanR> right so say the left side has type a and the right side has type b
[20:41:33] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a:  no, you are right, I agree game design trumps not only optimization but everything at all, like code hygiene; but it's good to intersperse furious experiments with refactoring to keep stuff managable
[20:42:10] <EvanR> e.g. a=(Int,String), b=[Card]
[20:42:35] <EvanR> Card=area x face
[20:43:32] <EvanR> right now the pictures just sit there unless you type
[20:43:53] <EvanR> re-rendering both anytime there is any event works
[20:45:16] <EvanR> for mouse experiments, i'm going to do Card=area x face x hidden, and clicking on a card toggles hidden
[21:07:08] <ManofLetters[m]> EvanR: sounds good and will naturally change over time; representation takes time to fine-tune and usually has the most impact on both maintainability and speed
[21:07:32] <EvanR> seems right
[21:30:16] <EvanR> oh hell yeah... I can toggle the cards by clicking üòé
[21:30:40] <EvanR> if I turn this into a memory game real fast, I can say... it's a game
[21:39:32] <ManofLetters[m]> bingo
