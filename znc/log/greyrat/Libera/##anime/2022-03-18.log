[07:08:04] <Nanobot> Wow. This fucking garbage company... They replaced my broken trash bin with a new one, but it's shaped differently. Instead of having a squarish interior, it's sort of a U shape, which prevents me from making full use of its volume. So, I'm paying for the same volume container, but the effective volume is now significantly smaller (from eyeballing it, it looks like I'll probably be able to fit only half the garbage bags I could before).

[13:06:03] <Cryowolf> it's such an obvious p2w cash cow game
[13:06:18] <lastonestanding> you can play it without spending money
[13:06:41] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: deeper analysis indicates it's pay to lose
[13:06:50] <Cryowolf> yes but that goes for most freemium games. You just won't play it as efficiently and the grind will be extreme
[13:06:52] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: or pay to waifu

[13:07:12] <lastonestanding> but you don't have to do that
[13:07:12] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], true...paying for virtual items is weird
[13:07:21] <lastonestanding> just play and enjoy it

[13:09:33] <amigojapan> What a nickname Kill-Animals 
[13:09:38] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu_onaph: I'll use it. I have used it before, but what makes it different than say gimp?

[13:09:49] <Cryowolf> Clip STudio Paint doesnt work in Linux afaik
[13:10:01] <Cryowolf> but you can get like 4 months free use of its pro version
[13:10:04] <jessedesu_onaph> Gimp is more for photo editing
[13:10:21] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu_onaph: Oh I can see what you mean by that.
[13:10:23] <jessedesu_onaph> Krita from the ground up is for drawing
[13:10:34] <jessedesu_onaph> I recommend procreate 
[13:10:35] <Kill-Animals> now that you mention it, you are totally right about that.
[13:10:37] <jessedesu_onaph> For ipad
[13:10:40] <Cryowolf> gimp is a stripped down version of photoshop with less advanced systems. Though you can do a lot of photoshop stuff, they tend to require more work-arounds
[13:11:02] <Cryowolf> Clip Studio Paint is for me perfect for learning to draw
[13:11:02] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Like drawing a circle?
[13:11:15] <Cryowolf> uuh
[13:11:18] <Cryowolf> que?

[13:11:48] <Cryowolf> aha
[13:11:55] <jessedesu_onaph> It's really bloated
[13:12:00] <Cryowolf> yeah you can get it for free for 4 months
[13:12:12] <jessedesu_onaph> The rendering engine is slower than pro reate
[13:12:18] <Cryowolf> I don't think it's bloated. You can organize your workspace with what you need and set short-cuts to do more complex things
[13:12:30] <Cryowolf> and I never had it lag

[13:18:08] <Cryowolf> to stop the anticipated invsion
[13:18:09] <Shinra> gachi?
[13:18:14] <Cryowolf> that's my idea
[13:18:19] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: That has real appeal
[13:18:46] <Cryowolf> You think so? I just made it up on the fly
[13:19:02] <Kill-Animals> Kill-Animals: My idea for mecha, are things that spring up like towers, and then fire from high up. Kind of like a cherry picker. 
[13:19:51] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: I think a better twist would be machines having created humans, which end up becoming powerful enough to destroy them.
[13:20:02] <Kill-Animals> hehe
[13:20:26] <Cryowolf> Then you'd need to have it make sense how machines evolved naturally
[13:20:36] <Cryowolf> and why they created humans
[13:21:39] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: I was just thinking of that. How would a single celled "machine" evolve into a multi cell machine?
[13:22:24] <Cryowolf> They wouldn't. But you can always have an experiment in another reality sending over a single nanite that then occupied a single cell organism
[13:22:44] <Cryowolf> and when they began to divide, it became machine evolution
[13:23:16] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: That or you would have to think of an alternative theory for evolution. Epigenetics maybe applied to machines
[13:23:46] <Cryowolf> You need to make it easy enough for readers to get into and become interested in before you reveal the complexities
[13:23:51] <Cryowolf> you need a hook
[13:23:56] <Kill-Animals> the idea that, "If a giraffe needs fruit from up on high, it's genetic makeup will adapt to have longer necks"
[13:24:14] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Yeah totally agree. You always show dont tell.
[13:24:28] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: I always fault any anime that starts off by explaining its story line. 
[13:24:41] <Kill-Animals> Unless its through clever exposition.
[13:24:45] <Cryowolf> Overt exposition harms the story
[13:25:00] <Cryowolf> some exposition if they explain how something came to be in the beginning is fine
[13:25:19] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: The best exposition example I can think of is from the original terminator movie. Have you seen it?
[13:25:23] <Cryowolf> like why did a war start? Why are only those people fighting it?
[13:25:29] <Cryowolf> Of course I've seen it
[13:25:31] <Cryowolf> are you kidding?!
[13:25:51] <Cryowolf> It should be a crime to not have seen it
[13:26:00] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: lol remember the scene where whats-his-face is arrested and taken into interrogation room
[13:26:10] <Cryowolf> yeah
[13:26:11] <Kill-Animals> and he's explaining the future, and they all look at him like hes crazy
[13:26:20] <Cryowolf> yeah I remember
[13:26:27] <Kill-Animals> its such a brilliant way to do exposition. I love it so much.

[13:28:51] <Cryowolf> If time is cyclical that could explain the existence of mecha evolving by itself if something was sent back when time restarted
[13:28:59] <Kill-Animals> I can easily imagine the logic of a mechanic based lifeform wanting to see organic material as the ultimate form of perfection.
[13:29:36] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: You could also just have God as the explanation. I'm not sure what most people would think of that.
[13:29:38] <Cryowolf> I would more think they would create more advanced life forms to create a neural network capable of more than 1s and 0s
[13:29:51] <Cryowolf> through human brains
[13:29:52] <Kill-Animals> I don't mind the idea, it just seems unimaginative.
[13:30:07] <Cryowolf> that would be why they create humans
[13:30:10] <Cryowolf> why they even bother
[13:30:34] <Kill-Animals> Well that comes to the ghost in the shell idea. You would have to think of a mechanical system capable of "First Cause", which is synonymous with a soul.

[13:31:36] <Kill-Animals> oh on that; Well are there plants in the mecha world?
[13:32:23] <Cryowolf> I wouldn't go down the route of machine life wanting a soul. I would go down the route of them seeking to further evolve and facing a dead end where they are incapable of further mechanical evolution. But they detect neural activity in some species and they begin to experiment on them to evolve them until their brains and neural activity becomes advanced enough to be harvested and used in machines to overcome the 1s and 0s thinking
[13:32:38] <Cryowolf> I would think so that there are plants and organic life
[13:32:49] <owleris> robot will kill us
[13:32:57] <Cryowolf> evolving further in though and not in the beginning
[13:33:14] <Cryowolf> owleris, yes I believe that to be inevitable if an AI is allowed to run free and evolve
[13:33:32] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: hmmm, because I was thinking of actually suggesting that perhaps the robots wished to develop a "soul" 
[13:33:36] <Cryowolf> it wouldn't seek to eliminate us for any specific reason other than us being in the way
[13:33:46] <Kill-Animals> And saw a human as a way to do so.
[13:33:51] <owleris> Cryowolf: so how we avoid it
[13:34:05] <Cryowolf> but why do they wish that?  How do they wish that when they're not capable of meta-cognitive thinking
[13:34:25] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Well that depends how the AI is developed. I think if you programmed an AI to be religious, then it would not go out of control.
[13:34:31] <Cryowolf> owleris, we restrict AIs or create virtual intelligence instead that acts on parameters and restrictions, in capable of evolving on its own

[13:35:21] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Depends what religion. 
[13:35:42] <Cryowolf> or perhaps they all evolve to have a "core" that remains empty and they have nothing to fill it with and they begin seeking out ways to fill the void
[13:35:45] <Kill-Animals> Or perhaps not moral inclination, but a "duty"

[13:36:13] <Kill-Animals> "The void beckons"
[13:36:33] <Cryowolf> morality is very imprecise
[13:36:39] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Morality is dangerous period, depending on what you as an individual wish to achieve.
[13:37:01] <Kill-Animals> Morals are that which you carry out regardless of whether they benefit you or not.

[13:38:10] <Kill-Animals> maybe the machines seek their own destruction? 
[13:38:17] <Cryowolf> I would take the cash and then return it and say I found it :P
[13:39:00] <Cryowolf> the machines seek destruction but their programing prohibits it, so they want to create something that can destroy them and they come to the realization that machine life will always fail at it
[13:39:03] <Cryowolf> so they make humans
[13:39:12] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: I'm far too religious to be able to do something like that. I actually get physically terrified when I find someones stolen wallet. I want to return it and all the cash immediately.
[13:39:15] <Cryowolf> their programming still force them to fight to survive
[13:39:25] <Cryowolf> but they still go at it
[13:39:40] <Cryowolf> Kill-Animals, I don't think that has to do with religion
[13:39:42] <Kill-Animals> hmmmmmm Its an odd idea. Maybe I'll keep it on the back burner
[13:39:46] <Cryowolf> that's to do with moral teachings
[13:39:59] <Cryowolf> moral teachins can be extracted and taught without religion
[13:40:33] <Shinra> gachi gachi
[13:40:41] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Morals are neccessarily religious. They are "Categorical imperitives" (look up kant) that can only be justified with some ultimate authority.
[13:41:22] <Kill-Animals> otherwise, honestly if killing gets me what I want; its fair game without anything ultimate prohibitting it.
[13:41:30] <Urchin[emacs]> not really
[13:42:01] <Kill-Animals> Urchin[emacs]: I've thought this through a lot. But go ahead. Make your case.
[13:42:11] <Cryowolf> if machines are created to serve a species and then witness another species evolution carrying them to a form of acension. Machines may become obsessed with it and create a biological life form to "blend" with or whatnot
[13:42:17] <Urchin[emacs]> even today argument against killing tends to rest on consequentialist grounds - someone being dead is an undesirable consequence
[13:42:29] <DPA> I think morals are personal, but influenced by social interactions. Ethics are usually formed by some means of group consensus, comittee, or defined by other means. 
[13:42:37] <Urchin[emacs]> no fictional god needed
[13:42:38] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Hmmmmm, iteresting, but I feel like that idea has been done.

[13:44:32] <Kill-Animals> but okay lets walk this back to the original question. Why do machines want to create humans
[13:44:42] <Kill-Animals> Maybe they were created by accident?
[13:45:06] <Cryowolf> you could also abandon the idea of machines and go down the "elemental" route. Crystalline entities etc growing into large elemental like creatures that are functionally like mechas
[13:45:12] <Cryowolf> compatible with human neurology
[13:45:40] <Cryowolf> they're not "machines" but they're not organic
[13:45:41] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: in the sense that crystals grow? I think I have heard some thing like that.
[13:45:58] <Cryowolf> There's a species in Star Trek that's crystalline
[13:46:06] <Cryowolf> but thats not the one I mean

[13:46:47] <Kill-Animals> oh hmmm
[13:46:51] <Cryowolf> the elementals being compatible with human neurology is discovered by accident
[13:47:06] <Kill-Animals> Well I've watched all of DS9, and bits and pieces of others. 
[13:47:10] <Cryowolf> when a early human pre-historical, encountered them
[13:47:20] <Cryowolf> They were in TOS and Enterprise
[13:47:38] <Cryowolf> DS9 had the Breen which were really weird and the changelings
[13:47:43] <Kill-Animals> interesting I'll have to watch it
[13:47:52] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: lol I was thinking about the breen
[13:47:57] <Kill-Animals> but not the changelings!
[13:47:59] <Kill-Animals> hmmm
[13:48:30] <Kill-Animals> thats funny, its very similar to our story, because the changelings also created human life forms
[13:48:53] <Cryowolf> Incorrect, they discovered them and then experimented on them to evolve them into their servants
[13:49:21] <Kill-Animals> really? I thought some were created pretty much ground up
[13:49:29] <Cryowolf> the vorta were ape-like creatures that protected a changeling and so they were rewarded by evolution into servants that work high up in their echelon
[13:49:35] <Kill-Animals> ahhhh right!
[13:49:46] <Kill-Animals> but what about the tetracel white creaters?
[13:50:02] <Cryowolf> the uh....I forget their name, the lizards. They were a species tamed by ketracel white
[13:50:12] <Kill-Animals> yeah figures
[13:50:14] <Cryowolf> made addicted so they had to obey
[13:50:48] <Kill-Animals> hmmm there is also the angle of say ghosts or something similar
[13:50:51] <Cryowolf> then there were other members of the dominion. Like those weird traders. They weren't created, rather they were recruited for their ability
[13:50:59] <DPA> If machines were capable of evolving on their own, they would probably not be too dissimilar to biological life forms. After all, things like the fear of death, and the will to live & reproduce, are essential for evolutionary success, as live who lacks it may just die out. But there would still have to be death & replication of sorts, or there can be no evolution.
[13:51:07] <Kill-Animals> i don't love this idea, but you could perhaps say, that ghosts created the robots, which then created the humans.
[13:51:18] <Cryowolf> ghosts? eh
[13:51:58] <Kill-Animals> DPA: Agreed. Thats why I think epigenetics would work better with robots than evolution.
[13:52:03] <Cryowolf> I would rather say incorporeal species of high intelligence that started to interfere minimally with evolution on a planet to create vessels for themselves. Making machines
[13:52:13] <Cryowolf> but later wanting biological vessels
[13:52:45] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Like, demons creating machines, that would be kind of cool
[13:53:35] <Kill-Animals> Or better yet; invisible being stuck in pergatory, try and build machines to help them get out of pergatory
[13:53:42] <Cryowolf> I'm feeling a little better now so I'm gonna play some cyberpunk 2077, I waited for a long time to play this
[13:53:46] <Cryowolf> now Im playing it through geforce now
[13:54:02] <Shinra> I'm playing that game too Cryowolf 
[13:54:14] <Cryowolf> I'm still in the beginning
[13:54:24] <Cryowolf> I haven't moved on with the dex quest
[13:54:37] <Cryowolf> been farming some cash and such
[13:54:37] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Feeling better? Were you sick, or do you find creative talk really energizing?
[13:54:42] <Shinra> yeah I did the same
[13:54:43] <Cryowolf> Im sick yes
[13:54:44] <Cryowolf> covid
[13:54:48] <Shinra> I'm only just after that first mission
[13:54:52] <Cryowolf> took NSAID and paracetamol
[13:54:55] <Cryowolf> fever down a bit now
[13:54:57] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Ah. Are you nauseous?
[13:55:15] <Cryowolf> I was but I have anti-nausea medicine from when I was in chemo
[13:55:21] <Kill-Animals> I ask because I didnt get nauseous at all when I was sick with covid. I was wondering if that was normal
[13:55:29] <Kill-Animals> CHEMO?!
[13:55:36] <Cryowolf> yea
[13:55:51] <Kill-Animals> bro ! You are so smart and full of life! That sucks!
[13:56:22] <Cryowolf> thanks. My chances go up each day. They removed it and gave me chemo but the risk of it coming back is still like 30%
[13:56:39] <Cryowolf> and if it comes back I will probably die
[13:57:04] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Ill make a crazy suggestion. You are free to call me crazy, most people do, but I think you can battle cancer by switching to a raw meat diet, and there is good evidence for it.
[13:57:16] <Cryowolf> Not this cancer
[13:57:22] <Kill-Animals> Brain cancer?
[13:57:26] <Cryowolf> no
[13:57:27] <Cryowolf>  MPNST
[13:57:32] * Kill-Animals looks it up
[13:57:33] <Cryowolf> google it, too complicated to explain
[13:57:46] <Cryowolf> I also have neurofibromatosis type 1 which makes it worse
[13:59:01] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: I think actually though that diet would help this too. You could be experiencing something akin to an allergic reaction. Most vegetables and plants are toxic and unfit for humans, and its just because we have eaten them for so long that we just assume its healthy.
[13:59:16] <Cryowolf> No
[13:59:25] <Shinra> lol wtf
[13:59:35] <Shinra> who let this whackjob in here
[13:59:36] <Cryowolf> I'm experiencing an error in cromosome 17
[13:59:41] <Cryowolf> responsible for cell division
[13:59:45] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: I switched to a raw meat diet three years ago. Everything, absolutely everything improved.
[14:00:09] <Cryowolf> well maybe you had some conditions that made switching to that good
[14:00:18] <Cryowolf> but don't attribute your own experience to everyone
[14:00:22] <Cryowolf> that's ego-centric
[14:00:35] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: And that is related to diet as well. It sounds like you don't want to hear this, but bro, when your life is on the line, take everything into consideration.
[14:00:58] <Cryowolf> I take what my oncologist and dietician says into consideration
[14:01:16] <Kill-Animals> ah. well were you vaccinated?
[14:01:29] <Cryowolf> for covid? yeah 3 times
[14:01:38] <Kill-Animals> and you still got covid? 
[14:01:40] <Cryowolf> yes
[14:02:22] <Kill-Animals> Well; where is your healthy skepticism? I know you are smart enough to be skeptical
[14:02:37] <Cryowolf> skepticism about what?
[14:03:05] <Kill-Animals> about relying upon, lets call it, orthodox medical advice.
[14:03:08] <Shinra> if you understand how vaccines and the immune system works there is no need
[14:03:31] <Shinra> I have an exam coming up on immunology soon 
[14:03:41] <Kill-Animals> Shinra: I wasnt vaxed. When I got covid, I was not once nauseous. I ate raw meat. 
[14:03:42] <Cryowolf> I'm not an expert or professional. I haven't spent years to learn how cancer works. Specifically sarcomas. Which my team of experts that handle my case does. They all have their own expertise
[14:04:05] <Cryowolf> and I yield to their authority because I have no authority in this and doing something against their recommendation is just dumb at this point
[14:04:18] <Cryowolf> since doing everything theyve said has so far kept me alive and cancer free
[14:04:30] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Its not "expertise" though. Its conformity to orthodoxy. 
[14:04:35] <Cryowolf> every day I live is another day my chances to survive go up
[14:04:51] <Cryowolf> call it what you want
[14:04:57] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Like here just roll back. Ill give you an example.
[14:05:03] <Cryowolf> I'm a realist, not a spiritualist
[14:05:11] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: Me too.
[14:05:16] <Shinra> conspiracy theorist*
[14:05:57] <Cryowolf> then you should know it's not realistic to expect untested unorthodox stuff like just eating raw meat to result in curing cancer or whatnot
[14:06:19] <Kill-Animals> hold on. Dont get ahead of myself here.
[14:06:21] <Cryowolf> let's just end this part of the conversation by saying, I don't believe in the things you do and I do things my way here
[14:06:29] <Cryowolf> and I don't want to talk about my cancer anymore
[14:06:42] <Cryowolf> so enough
[14:06:52] <Kill-Animals> Suppose hypothetically raw meat, ends up being the healthiest thing a human can consume. What happens when I decide to open up a raw meat resturaunt?
[14:07:39] <Kill-Animals> I get shut down. Obviously. Ill leave it at that. Also I doubt your oncologist would oppose you trying to improve your diet.
[14:08:08] <Cryowolf> Yes you get shut down because I don't want to talk about my cancer
[14:08:28] <Kill-Animals> Cryowolf: AHHH MAN DONT BE MADE AT ME. I think you are cool, I just want to give you options.
[14:08:28] <Cryowolf> I indulged you despite me feeling bad over talking about it

[14:12:16] <Cryowolf> dunno
[14:12:27] <Kill-Animals> I think thats the right one. Where there is a clone of picard trying to kill him
[14:12:36] <Cryowolf> no that's the next one
[14:12:49] <Shinra> Brian Epstein, former manager of the Beatles, was old and died of natural causes 
[14:12:50] <Urchin[emacs]> Epstein did show signs of preparing to kill himself, mainly by moving his assets away from the reach of victims
[14:12:53] <Cryowolf> insurrection is where a species is trying to take over a planet
[14:13:19] <Cryowolf> it was Star Trek Nemesis
[14:13:25] <Kill-Animals> Nemesis.
[14:13:26] <Cryowolf> thats where Picard has a clone

The egg represented the dream, and the man broke the egg to show that there's nothing inside, bringing the girl back to reality."
[15:10:04] <DunceCotus> however it also seems to have kickstarted another loop
[15:10:22] <DunceCotus> in my mind its about the dual folly of reason-unreason

[15:27:06] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: s/need/want/
[15:27:15] <DunceCotus> why do you need subwoofer
[15:27:19] <teus> Cryowolf: depends
[15:27:21] <DunceCotus> just use headphones baybay
[15:27:28] <teus> they also come with an amplifier
[15:27:44] <teus> IEM's are somewhat cheaper to make than over-ears
[15:27:45] <Sapphirus> Nah, DunceCotus. I'd rather immerse myself in the sound.
[15:27:55] <teus> same way headphones are cheaper to make than speakers
[15:28:54] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: I envy that.. neighbours would complain here if I turned on subwoofers
[15:28:57] <DunceCotus> or ran a home theatre
[15:29:18] <DunceCotus> so im always in headphones..
[15:29:39] <Sapphirus> It's not that I want boomy base, either, rather I like an accurate image that blends in with my speakers.
[15:30:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I just use the ordinary should from the devices
[15:30:10] <Sapphirus> I don't like audio setups where you can pick out everything.
[15:30:12] <teus> if neighbours make noise, its very reassuring that my speaker setup will go louder than anything they can possibly do
[15:30:33] <teus> i never have to do it, but its reassuring like owning nuclear weapons
[15:30:39] <Sapphirus> "Oh, that's the subwoofer." if you can pick it apart from the rest of the speakers, then it's not calibrated well at all.
[15:30:48] <teus> most systems with a subwoofer are shit
[15:30:57] <teus> theres a fat deep base, then nothing, and then the mids begin
[15:31:07] <amigojapan> teus: in Japan you will easily get kicked out of you rent and make much noise
[15:31:11] <Sapphirus> That's a shit system. Mine isn't setup like that.
[15:31:18] <teus> of course
[15:31:22] <Sapphirus> Subwoofers should augment not standout.
[15:31:25] <teus> but most audio setups are like that nowadays
[15:31:59] <teus> amigojapan: yeah and in belgium a landlord has to sue tenants for 1-2 years so they can throw them out, if they have a mountain of evidence

[16:09:25] <snake> its hard
[16:09:34] <amigojapan> snake: oh. Tomako says water colour are harder cause you can't change stuff

[16:11:06] <teus> stubborn is the right word
[16:11:12] <isekaijin> Like, learn Russian? No problemo. Learn English? That's sacrilege!
[16:11:28] <teus> yeah, maybe the other people in the chatroom will be more willing to believe you about this isekaijin 
[16:12:00] <darkwitch> soumen hair for me? thank you very much!
[16:12:06] <teus> in my country we even have a legal language border between dutch and french, with the french constantly invading across the language barrier
[16:12:39] <teus> "now we live here, and we demand all public facilities speak french now"
[16:13:25] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[16:13:31] <isekaijin> Why not just partition Belgium, and give the Dutch, German and French-speaking parts back to the Netherlands, Germany and France, respectively?
[16:13:48] <teus> nobody wants to annex the french speaking part because theyre broke
[16:13:49] <Sadale> LOL
[16:14:02] <teus> not even the french want the french-speaking part of belgium
[16:14:05] <snake> teus, sounds like french language is winning then LOL
[16:14:06] <Sadale> "There's no Belgium"
[16:14:12] <teus> snake: long story
[16:14:14] <snake> soon belgium will be all french
[16:14:18] <teus> french was the story of the upper class here
[16:14:23] <teus> we had to fight for the right to speak dutch
[16:14:33] <teus> we were oppressed by the french speaking
[16:15:03] <snake> probably since dutch and german are inferior languages
[16:15:08] <isekaijin> rofl
[16:15:20] <teus> this doesnt go long back, when the nazis occupied belgium they granted more rights for speaking dutch
[16:15:23] <snake> no wonder the french speakers are demanding it be spoken where they move to
[16:15:38] <teus> snake: french are too proud
[16:15:46] <teus> even in paris, they look down upon everyone else who doesnt live in paris
[16:15:56] <teus> its like a pyramid of looking down of people
[16:16:10] <snake> teus, don't get all bent out of shape because your favorite language is losing the fight for #1
[16:16:19] <teus> :)
[16:16:22] <isekaijin> snake: Dutch was the language of Huygens. German was the language of Planck and Einstein. What the heck are going on about with “inferior languages”?
[16:16:35] <Sadale> lol
[16:16:40] <snake> isekaijin, im just joking
[16:16:48] <snake> i think this is "much ado about nothing"
[16:16:52] <Sadale> IMHO English's the actual inferior language :P
[16:16:58] <Sadale> That's because everyone can speak it.
[16:17:01] <teus> english IS an inferior language
[16:17:03] <isekaijin> Sadale: Well, English was the language of Newton.
[16:17:14] <teus> but its such a melting pot and easy for everyone to learn
[16:17:21] <Sadale> pfffffft

[16:18:25] <darkwitch> amigojapan, what happened to the A?
[16:18:39] <Sadale> The main problem of English is the vocabulary and the pronunciation/spelling

[16:28:09] <Sadale> Then just stick with the language forever for the entire country.
[16:28:14] <isekaijin> hahaha
[16:28:20] <amigojapan> isekaijin: cause it excludes minorities in your country by law

[17:33:50] <Sadale> do PCR test then :3

[22:45:33] <emmeka> by... some of the staff of the original it seems, creating a new studio explicitly to make it?
[22:45:57] <emmeka> not the people who made the two shitty sequels
[22:46:32] <MootPoot> I see all the nostalgia milking hollywood has done recently is working its way into japan

[22:48:36] <emmeka> FLCL was dubbed by a bunch of weebs with direct feedback from the Japanese producers and in many ways improves upon the original. Or sometimes they just speak Japanese directly in the dub anyway, because fuck it, it's FLCL.
[22:48:47] <MootPoot> tbh I didn't really know what FLCL was or why it was good
[22:48:54] <MootPoot> I just downloaded it because I saw that gif

[22:51:24] <emmeka> MootPoot well. FLCL is basically the result of Gainax giving its top staff permission to make whatever the fuck they want and see how it goes.
[22:51:46] <emmeka> keep in mind this was the era when Gainax was the summit of the anime industry thanks to Eva and such
[22:52:43] <emmeka> MootPoot FLCL is something that is generally either loved or hated. It's very symbolic, and surreal. You're either someone who can appreciate the symbolism and narrative within it, or just gets annoyed by the neverending slapstick weirdness.
[22:52:57] <emmeka> but it has, undisputably, one of the best fucking anime soundtracks of all time.
[22:53:16] <S_T_A_N> its a more subtle Turning Red
[22:53:36] <emmeka> MootPoot but yes. watch FLCL dubbed, and watch it now, it's literally 6 episodes. It's one of those things that's just obligatory

[23:03:14] <emmeka> MootPoot something kind of fun about it is that its creator watched the dub and said he liked it better than the original. The people who dubbed it were a bunch of first gen anime fans who cut their teeth like fansubbing copies of Japanese anime VHSs and shit, like imagine modern day giving a bunch of fansubbers permission to run the dub of an anime

[23:13:17] <emmeka> well sure, but with kids.
[23:14:15] <emmeka> FLCL isn't really for kids. in fact, when I first watched it in the 2000s, I didn't really "get" it. But when I rewatched it later in life, it resonated with me more.
[23:16:11] <lastonestanding> I remember someone in my class was not allowed to watch dragon ball because it was too brutal

But starting in I think 2001, Cartoon Network started airing an adult animation bloc late at night on Saturdays. It was the first real time that that we got anime targetted at grownups in the west, and you had things like Gundam, Trigun, and Cowboy Bebop and FLCL on it, back then.
