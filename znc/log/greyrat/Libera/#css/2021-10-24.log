[00:00:30] <hassoon> so you teached people for 8 weeks which got reduced to 6
[00:00:35] <hmw[at]> yea
[00:00:42] <hmw[at]> I was soo tired all the time
[00:00:53] <hmw[at]> Little time to spare to explain things fully
[00:01:06] <hmw[at]> I did my best and was proud to have not a single pupil fail the exams
[00:01:21] <hassoon> teaching would last for e.g one semester or a whole year, 6 weeks is like a short mission
[00:01:55] <hmw[at]> ECDL was about Office. Text processing, spread sheet, data bases with Access (relatively advanced stuff even), using Google, etc
[00:03:06] <hmw[at]> 6 weeks is hard for that, if you are starting from literally zero
[00:03:17] <hmw[at]> but doable, as it turned out
[00:12:44] <hassoon> ya you did well, all pupils passed the exam under those circumstances :)
[00:16:00] <hmw[at]> For six weeks I didn't have any free time really, because it was very tiring, so I slept my free time away. It was still a good experience, and I was proud
[00:16:42] <hmw[at]> Would do it again, if I get to teach for a saner amount of time. You can put up that kind of effort only for so long until you're completey exhausted
[00:18:34] <hmw[at]> lol. After so much time I still see traces of this being a traumatic experience heheh
[00:18:49] <hmw[at]> Stupid company. I don't like them, as you might have inferred
[00:20:46] <hmw[at]> They payed me less than a plumber would earn
[00:21:10] <hassoon> don't the pupils pay too ?
[00:21:38] <hmw[at]> The state payed it. It was a huge car factory, and they were in some kind of unemployment re-education program
[00:21:59] <hmw[at]> IIRC some thousand people lost their job back then
[00:22:31] <hmw[at]> At least they got real education. Usually unemployed people get sent to courses, where they teach you how to write a resume

[21:00:23] <Wafficus> Hey there, I need some help in figuring out how to deal with the additional space that's occurring on the redesign of my site
[21:00:38] <Wafficus> Under each sub heading there's an additional space for some reason: https://musimatic.xyz/index2021.html
[21:01:02] <Wafficus> Ex: under "ARCHIVE" there's this separate block that I can't figure out how is being formed
[21:02:29] <lantech19446> your class left menu section includes a 15px margin on the bottom
[21:03:01] <Wafficus> I'll check, thanks for the heads up
[21:04:57] <Wafficus> just removed that CSS rule for the margin, but still the same effect is present

[21:07:09] <lantech19446> Wafficus: if you're not using a reset that theskillwithin is very likely right you'll need to get rid of the margin and use a reset
[21:07:11] <Wafficus> like .left_menu_section p {}

[21:22:44] <Wafficus> how would do a reset in this scenario if you don't mind me asking
[21:23:02] <Wafficus> are you saying that I should use a 'clear' in that scenario? lantech19446
[21:23:17] <lantech19446> because the purpose of a reset is to set all those browser defaults to 0
[21:23:44] <lantech19446> https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
[21:23:50] <lantech19446> this is the one i use
[21:24:20] <lantech19446> it's as simple and copy and paste and it takes care of all those browser defaults so you're on level ground no matter which browser you're displaying in
[21:27:49] <Wafficus> gotcha cool thanks

[22:47:47] <shan> what is a good answer to "why is ch better than em for specifying the max width of text"? it makes sense to me intuitively but I'm not able to phrase an explanation properly
[22:50:46] <pavonia> Because 1em is usually wider than 1ch for proportional fonts
[22:51:56] <pavonia> If you are only dealing with digits, ch shoudl be the "correct" unit. If you are dealing with mixed text, ch is ususally a good average char width unit
[22:53:16] <shan> right ok
[22:54:18] <shan> pavonia: so an em is the width of the 'm' character, isn't it?
[22:54:46] <shan> or is that not how this works
[22:55:21] <shan> oh it's the height of an m?
[22:55:30] <pavonia> The width of "M" traditionally, but it doesn'T need to be exactly that width
