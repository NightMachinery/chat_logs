[01:28:01] <epolanski> fake as "unsuitable" data type I guess you mean
[01:28:27] <ljharb> epolanski: it's fake in the sense that it's masquerading as a matrix but isn't one
[01:28:36] <ljharb> epolanski: and has different storage and performance implications
[01:29:30] <epolanski> why isn't it a matrix? seems like a subpar encoding to me, but still conforms to a matrix definition
[01:29:37] <systemfault> I wonder if a class backed by a single typed array would be the best performance-wise
[01:31:01] <ljharb> epolanski: typically it's an array of columns, or an array of rows
[01:31:24] <ljharb> epolanski: whichever conceptual category the top-level items are, "the other one" can't be looked up easily
[01:31:43] <ljharb> epolanski: like, you can do `faketrix[row][column]` but not `faketrix[column][row]`

[01:42:25] <ThePendulum> honestly this whole function is the weirdest thing, essentially const affected = list.reduce((acc, newItem) => ({ ...acc, ...items.filter(itemFilter, { foo, bar }) })); return Object.keys(affected).map((key) => affected[key]);
[01:43:01] <ThePendulum> it seems to me they didn't realize they can reduce into an array in the first place, and subsequently forgot Object.values exists

[01:43:43] <ThePendulum> in addition to passing arguments to array#filter as `this` instead of a wrapping function
[01:44:38] <ljharb> that is really confusing yes
[01:44:51] <ljharb> ThePendulum: the reducer doesn't use `newItem` at all?
[01:44:54] <ThePendulum> since the keys in that intermediate object are array indeces it also isn't filtering anything, so I think they could just use a flatmap
[01:45:06] <ThePendulum> let me see, the actual code is under an NDA so I need to abstract it a bit
[01:45:16] <ljharb> but yeah if it can be a flatMap then def use that

[01:51:13] <epolanski> hmm, I'm getting EACCESS permisison denied error when trying to fs.chmod a file in `.git/hooks` do I have to launch the script in some other way? that kinda defeats the purpose of writing this hooks installer
[01:51:54] <systemfault> What is your chmod command?
[01:52:42] <ljharb> epolanski: eesh, a "hooks installer" sounds like a terrible idea and a huge security hole. there's a reason why git itself doesn't allow git hooks to be auto-installed.
[01:53:11] <epolanski> like, it's literally what many libraries do
[01:53:24] <epolanski> I need to setup some custom hooks for our project
[01:53:56] <ljharb> epolanski: yes, libraries that use husky are security problems
[01:54:07] <ljharb> epolanski: why do you need custom clientside hooks?
[01:54:26] <ljharb> since hooks are easily bypassed on the client, they don't provide any guarantees, only questionable convenience and slowing down rebasing
[01:55:21] <epolanski> I need to implement a series of rules in our organization that prevent committing specific stuff in specific branches

[02:23:34] <ljharb> epolanski: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fschmodpath-mode-callback says `fs.chmod(path, fs.constants.S_IXUSR | fs.constants.S_IXGRP | fs.constants.S_IXOTH)` should do it
[02:23:48] <ljharb> those constants end up being the same as `0o111`
[02:24:15] <ljharb> epolanski: re `0o001`, the last digit is for "others", so you might want `0o100` for "user"
[02:27:26] <systemfault> It's a "set", so I imagine that using 1o100 sets the execute bit but removed the read bit..
[02:27:38] <epolanski> looking at the error more accurately it seems like the issue happens before trying to change the mode

[18:51:33] <banana_> velix: or if you dont have a https connection you could just pass it in the cookie and have your php control each users session
[18:52:00] <velix> yeah, but why POST and not GET? How does POST make this more secure?
[18:52:59] *** Joins: sub0 (~bc8147f2@cerf.good1.com)
[18:53:00] <banana_> idk about that POST part. POST is used for saving resource objects and GET is used to retrieve a resource object or a list of resource objects
[18:53:42] <banana_> im not sure if POST is technically more secure than GET they're just used for different kinds of http requests
[18:54:19] <stenno> maybe just so that request parameter don't show up in the webserver logs
[18:54:35] <banana_> what's most secure is using that secure cookie if your server is using https
[18:54:55] <banana_> ^ maybe what stenno just said

[18:56:52] <asteele> post vs get is not inherently more secure.  post may be expecting you to originate from their website though, so it could include tokens and whatnot that might help validate the request.  but in the end you can design both responses to give you what you want
[18:57:11] <stenno> correct
[18:57:19] <asteele> the guy is using file.php as his main page redirect, i dont think top security is of much concern
[18:57:22] <velix> asteele: but get also allows me to include tokens in header?
[18:58:00] <stenno> you can set arbitrary headers with fetch regardless of the http verb
[18:58:02] <rick123> You anyway don't share session IDs with frontend. You just give it the user data required to render the webapp according to a "logged in user".
[18:58:03] <banana_> yeah it does but ideally you want to pass auth tokens in a cookie
[18:59:21] <stenno> you can also send credentials regardless of http verb
[18:59:34] <banana_> Cookies kind of complicate the http protocol but allows your FE not to worry about auth at all. as long as the cookie, that the BE sets, is still valid the BE endpoints wont return 401

[20:28:01] <banana_> nailing the technical questions is way more important imo overall
[20:28:31] <prometh> if social is all that matters in software now, then i don't think i wanna be a part of it
[20:28:41] <austincheney> banana_, that is bad advise for attaining employment.  Knowing JS well is absolutely important, but not for the hiring process.
[20:28:48] <banana_> if you bomb answering their technical questions then they wont be too enthusiastic when they go over their personal questions
[20:29:05] <silly> lol, social is #1 everywhere, except if they really don't care about anything
[20:29:16] <prometh> why is social important?
[20:29:27] <prometh> if the applicant is a nice person and skilled; that should be enough
[20:29:36] <prometh> why do they need to be a social butterfly?
[20:29:38] <ljharb> prometh: that's all that's always mattered tbh
[20:29:45] <ljharb> prometh: and it's not about software, that's how human society works
[20:29:46] <banana_> idk I been in interviews where if you nail down the technical answers they're way more relaxed when asking personal questions. personal questions are important but in my experience less difficult than tech questions
[20:30:02] <prometh> ljharb: so, i should stop coding and start mingling?
[20:30:15] <banana_> "have you ever had a situation where you and your team didn't agree on something, and what did you do to resolve that situation"
[20:30:16] <ljharb> prometh: you can correctly wonder why society is so pro-extravert and anti-introvert, and so dependent on social niceties, but that doesn't mean it'll ever change
[20:30:41] <ljharb> banana_: the difficulty varies widely by individual
[20:30:44] <banana_> if you answer "yeah I disagreed with ljharb about something technical and I told him to eff off" yeah at that point you wouldnt get hired
[20:30:49] <prometh> ljharb: that would explain why getting work was so much easier 10-15 years ago.. i was full extrovert

[20:36:06] <paulcarroty> it will, without 100% success for sure
[20:36:08] <ljharb> austincheney: i've worked at plenty of startups with plenty of age ranges

[20:36:31] <ljharb> to be fair, the older one gets, the more likely one is to have a family and thus be unable to do that
[20:36:45] <ljharb> but a single 50 year old is much better for a young startup than a 22 year old who's married with kids
[20:38:02] <prometh> do early startups pay well?
[20:38:23] <prometh> i've ever been hired at that stage; always after they started to become successful
[20:38:30] <austincheney> ljharb, more than half the startups I was interviewing with did not want code experience.  they wanted trends and tools.
[20:38:36] <paulcarroty> if you're too old - creat an online business/startup, here nobody give shit even you're a cat.
[20:38:50] <ljharb> prometh: no, not usually
[20:39:09] <ljharb> austincheney: because if you have code experience but don't follow the trends and new tools, then you're not that good at your job. experience should be teaching you that.
[20:39:15] <austincheney> prometh, before COVID startups only paid well in high cost of living areas, but now they pay well everywhere until they run out of cash
[20:39:38] <gkatsev> early stage startups will often not pay as well but give more equity

[20:42:02] <austincheney> equity is risky too, it comes with limitations that may not be favorable.  Many early Twitter employees ended up selling their equity to VCs and private investors

[21:57:19] <banana_> ah ok that might explain why some places dont reach back to you
[21:57:42] <ljharb> banana_: adderall doesn't make anyone an introvert
[21:57:47] <prometh> i probably wouldn't pass either.. i still can't understand parts of Big O
[21:57:47] <systemfault> In Canada, degrees only matter when you want a job at the government... or some very specialized places (Usually not-web-related)
[21:57:55] <ljharb> adderall is an amphetamine. it makes ADD people able to focus, and it makes everyone else wired
[21:58:14] <prometh> wehat is "wired" by the way?
[21:58:22] <prometh> is that like stoned?
[21:58:24] <banana_> it means introverted
[21:58:25] <prometh> or buzzed?
[21:58:27] <ljharb> like when you have too much caffeine
[21:58:28] <ljharb> banana_: no, it doesn't

[21:59:17] <ljharb> prometh: stimulants cause people to be wired. caffeine is a stimulant, like nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine etc.
[21:59:35] <banana_> yeah but certain words are used based on perspective than actuality
[21:59:39] <ljharb> "stoned" is usually when you take a narcotic.
[21:59:39] <banana_> so youre talking about actuality
[21:59:54] <ljharb> banana_: and "ADD makes you introverted" is the same kind of nonsense statement as "vaccines cause autism"
[22:00:01] <ljharb> banana_: sorry "adderall makes you introverted"
[22:00:06] <ljharb> banana_: it's just not even remotely true
[22:00:13] <ljharb> banana_: there's no subjectivity.
[22:00:22] <banana_> *prospection
[22:01:53] <banana_> yeah if you assume being introverted as something definitive, I think to Person A Person B could be labeled introverted but to Person C's perception Person B is an extravert. so it's relative
[22:01:54] <banana_> imo

[22:04:58] <ljharb> (it's "extravert" btw, not "extrovert")
[22:04:59] <banana_> so yeah you're right if there's an objective description of being introverted, but yeah I guess I was just giving my opinion based on how the term is actually used in society
[22:05:18] <joepie91> that thing had far, far more effect on my energy levels than it seems should be possible
[22:05:30] <banana_> which is it's used as a label based on someone's opinion and judgement versus a specific truth.

[22:06:45] <banana_> just my opinion and I think other people share that opinion
[22:06:51] <banana_> definitely not everybody though.
[22:07:09] <joepie91> banana_: anyway, hi, am ADHD and semi-regularly on stimulant meds for it now. it doesn't "make me an introvert", but it certainly *does* calm my brain the fuck down so that I can actually condense my thoughts into words better, rather than just rambling off in a mostly-unordered fashion
[22:07:11] <ljharb> banana_: then all who do are wrong. it's medically false.
[22:07:27] <prometh> joepie91: hello again... yeah, i have a weighted blanket, actually

[22:10:00] <joepie91> otherwise the effectiveness will reduce
[22:10:07] <banana_> i disagree. also how could you assure 100% someone elses impression
[22:10:10] <joepie91> (been noticing the same)
[22:10:17] <prometh> banana_: i think i come across as extroverted with some introverted reactions being misread as not liking them
[22:10:26] <banana_> you mean you think people's general impression wont be what I'm saying
[22:10:36] <onosendi1> Just curious, how does a weighted blanket help with anxiety?
[22:10:58] <prometh> joepie91: currently, i'm using a king sized (45lb, i think) blanket on a double sized bed
[22:11:03] <ljharb> banana_: because after 30 years of people desperately trying to find flaws in medication given to children, if it were able to change people's behavior in a significant fashion then it would have been widely reported on
[22:11:05] <ljharb> banana_: it's just not a thing
[22:11:18] <onosendi1> Sounds like a marketing team broke into the pharmaceutical department with a blanket.
[22:11:19] <ljharb> banana_: i think that it will almost never be what you're saying
[22:11:20] <joepie91> prometh: ah that's fairly heavy already, then
[22:11:21] <prometh> joepie91: interesting, thanks
[22:11:30] <prometh> (the cycling)
[22:11:34] <ljharb> banana_: and i think that if they have the impression of introversion, someone taking ADD medication will be entirely unrelated to that impression
[22:11:43] <prometh> or "alternating"
[22:11:47] <joepie91> prometh: I have a 7kg 'wide single', though of course the thing that matters is how much of that weight is actually on your body, so it's hard to compare different sizes :p
[22:11:49] <ljharb> onosendi1: i mean, it calms dogs
[22:11:56] <joepie91> yeah np, I hope it helps
[22:12:05] <joepie91> interestingly I have to do the same for my ritalin
[22:12:05] <prometh> i'm like ~155lbs
[22:12:08] <ljharb> onosendi1: animals, including humans, like feeling secure and safe and warm
[22:12:13] <onosendi1> ljharb: while their under it though, correct. Not long term?
[22:12:18] <joepie91> seems like my body is a little too good at adjusting to circumstances
[22:12:30] <banana_> ljharb: I disagree but I see your argument
[22:12:31] <onosendi1> they're*
[22:13:54] <ljharb> onosendi1: sure but is it that confusing that feeling safer while sleeping makes you sleep better, which then causes a ton of positive long term effects?
[22:14:12] <joepie91> onosendi1: the exact workings of weighted blankets are not totally clear and like rather varied; it's known that a lot of people diagnosed as 'autistic' need a lot of sensory input in the form of pressure on their body to feel comfortable, more than the average person, and so a weighted blanket helps with that during sleep. for me personally it has *significantly* improved the *quality* of my sleep, meaning I am actually well-rested in the morning
[22:14:12] <joepie91> now and sleep much shorter than before
[22:14:19] <joepie91> s/and like/and likely/
[22:14:21] <banana_> I think any psychotropic drug has the potential to severely change your personality
[22:14:22] <onosendi1> Eh, I see your point.
[22:14:25] <onosendi1> ljharb ^
[22:14:30] <banana_> heard of liquid courage
[22:14:36] <ljharb> oh true, i also hadn't considered the autism spectrum angle of a higher threshold of sensory input
[22:14:56] <ljharb> banana_: you mean the phrase that's used to market alcohol and doesn't actually match what alcohol does?
[22:15:01] <joepie91> onosendi1: so yeah, for me personally, it is really the 'sleep quality' aspect - I suspect that previously I rarely ever actually had proper deep sleep
[22:15:08] <onosendi1> That makes sense.
[22:15:31] <joepie91> but I also have a potpourri of neurodiversity things so I have no idea which specific thing about it is making me sleep better :p

[22:15:50] <banana_> ljharb: so alcohol doesnt temporarily change your personality
[22:16:03] <joepie91> but it seems to be something involving a combination of 'racing brain' (ADHD) and needing strong sensory input
[22:16:05] <banana_> I guess we'll have to define personality and get into semantics
[22:16:17] <stenno> i always thought it was potpurree
[22:16:31] <stenno> so its italian, not french?
[22:16:35] <joepie91> a weighted blanket helps me calm down mentally, somehow, and that is probably what is making me sleep better
[22:16:37] <systemfault> French
[22:16:58] <stenno> oh no its french still
[22:17:13] <stenno> pot pourri
[22:17:16] <ljharb> banana_: it removes inhibitions

[22:17:29] <prometh> i sleep a bit bitter with a weighted blanket
[22:17:43] <prometh> but i still wake up at 1:30am each night
[22:17:58] <banana_> I think this convo is getting subjective
[22:18:22] <banana_> because define a personality and prove that self-consciousness doesn't constitute a personality
[22:18:44] <banana_> a lot of personality types are based on the person being super self-conscious, e.g. shy personality types etc.

[23:15:25] <mknod> varrg, exactly.
[23:15:29] <varrg> then you'll need to iterate it with a custom function
[23:16:04] <ljharb> ohhhh, ok
[23:16:34] <varrg> mknod, I take it this is from user input or string parsing, I'd filter out empty values in multiple steps. Perhaps you can filter out some before even creating the array? Could make a neater function in the end
[23:16:57] <ljharb> mknod: so you just want a true or false, indicating whether there exists an empty string surrounded by non-empty strings?
[23:17:38] <asteele> mknod const dontPutInArray = function(x) { // return true or false based on your own bits of code based how you want it };  const filtered = theArray.filter(dontPutInArray);

[23:20:05] <ljharb> oh wait `arr.some((x, i, a) => i > 0 && a[i - 1] !== '' && a[i] === '' && a[i + 1] !== '')`
[23:20:10] <ljharb> messed that one up in the reduce, too
[23:20:12] <systemfault> To me it's just as bad because of the "lie"
[23:20:18] <systemfault> But I understand your point.
[23:20:18] <ljharb> there's no lie
[23:20:20] <silly> bit cryptic tho
[23:20:44] <mknod> ljharb, parhaps a bit too smart for me. I started JavaScript yesterday by accident because sometimes Google Sheets formula just aren't enough.

[23:21:25] <jellobot> mknod, [ true, true ]
[23:21:32] <varrg> mknod, write it using a construct. Like foreach. Understand it then optionally rewrite it using .map, .reduce or .some
[23:21:48] <ljharb> n> var hasEmptySurroundedByNonEmpties = (x, i, a) => i > 0 && (i + 1) < a.length && a[i - 1] !== '' && a[i] === '' && a[i + 1] !== ''; [ [ 'foo', 'bar', '', 'qux'], [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', ''] ].map(x => x.some(hasEmptySurroundedByNonEmpties)) @ mknod
[23:21:49] <jellobot> mknod, [ true, false ]
[23:21:51] <ljharb> ha, there we go
[23:21:54] <varrg> mknod, these methods just iterate the array and shuv stuff into arguments.
[23:21:58] <ljharb> mknod: def time to learn JS then :-)

[23:23:25] <silly> dart world championships are now
[23:23:32] <ljharb> darts are great. dart is trash.
[23:23:36] <varrg> mknod, for what it's worth, this problem is a great lesson on iteration. You'll learn a lot so I'd recommend writing it yourself
[23:23:52] <silly> ah, ended yesterday
[23:24:18] <systemfault> Dart could be a good alternative to Java on Android... I'm surprised they're not killing Linux + Java and just use Fuschia + Dart instead.
[23:24:18] <mknod> varrg, I'm not a programming newbie. Just a JavaScript newbie. So I should be fine.
[23:24:24] <silly> oh look, it's dartS indeed
[23:24:51] <varrg> mknod, then the answer to your question is: iterate the array. And javascript has some functional approaches that makes cooler code
[23:25:10] <ljharb> mknod: JS is unique in a lot of ways, so programming knowledge from other languages is often actively harmful in JS. def don't assume you can just jump in
[23:25:14] <mknod> varrg, yeah, reminds me Perl.

[23:25:39] <systemfault> JS has been very painful to me at the beginning...

[23:27:33] <varrg> systemfault, I've just recently come to appreciate static typing, used to just see it as excessive keystrokes. Coming from php when it evolved to more static typing
[23:27:39] <silly> opening an old project, i had to learn that every other package has either changed their name or doesn't work with current versions of x
[23:28:17] <systemfault> varrg: static-typing doesn't mean that much by itself... it depends on what kind of static typing.
[23:28:22] <austincheney> systemfault, JS was my first language not counting things like XML/XSD, so the strict typing of TS is like a blessing
[23:28:25] <systemfault> varrg: Java gave it a REALLY bad name
[23:29:03] <gde35> systemfault: I went from raw machine code hunting the buffalo to the js vending machine
[23:29:12] <systemfault> austincheney: Been writing TS at work for the last 4 years, hehe
[23:29:55] <systemfault> I love TS's static typing, it doesn't get in the way and is crazy powerful.
[23:30:08] <gde35> systemfault: cant help but think we've lost something along the way but it sure is convenient!
[23:30:09] <varrg> I used to write functions like stringToArray and not seeing how I would need to type the argument as internally I'd never send anything but strings. Recently though, I typed a property and could leave it public because it would be valid for any string and because it is typed to string, the user can never break it even when the property is public
[23:30:13] <austincheney> if I were just on the front end TS would be a lot of hot air, but writing full stack with a lot of services TS is a monumental several orders of magnitude improvement
[23:30:25] <varrg> so that made it neater

[23:31:12] <systemfault> austincheney: I'm not that convinced of the benefit of TS on the frontend
[23:31:24] <systemfault> But backend, it's been great so far.
[23:31:45] <systemfault> oscurochu: I can solve that for you... nobody uses Jasmine anymore
[23:32:01] <oscurochu> oh thats good to know.
[23:32:03] <systemfault> oscurochu: Jest is the one that is used the most...
[23:32:13] <austincheney> the biggest benefits of TS on the frontend are not frontend specific, things like typing function output and arguments is huge everywhere
