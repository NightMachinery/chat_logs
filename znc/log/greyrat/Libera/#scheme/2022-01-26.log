[01:31:00] <bsima> are there any scheme implementations with a function like save-lisp-and-die?
[01:37:02] <gwatt> bsima: mit-scheme probably. I think most other schemes moved away from image oriented code.
[01:39:14] <edgar-rft> yeah, don't forget saving your lisp before you die

[01:40:53] <bsima> yeah its called disk-save
[01:40:56] <bsima> thanks gwatt 
[01:43:13] <sham1> I do wonder why image-based development was moved away from in the Scheme community at large

[01:51:58] <drakonis> it appears that will make a comeback in r7rs-large
[01:52:26] <drakonis> ah, actually, its a different feature that's getting lifted from mit scheme
[01:53:06] <bsima> i hope it makes a comeback
[01:53:34] <drakonis> environments are getting lifted from it

[01:56:51] <gwatt> I don't know. I think iamge based development makes rebuilding the current software state harder.
[01:58:48] <drakonis> probably.
[02:02:33] <drakonis> ther emight be some usecases for that though
[02:03:49] <drakonis> https://web.mit.edu/scheme_v9.2/doc/mit-scheme-ref/index.html this is the current documentation for mit scheme

[03:43:40] <edgar-rft> Zipheir: that's only true because Scheme lives most of its time in the gutter :-)
[03:45:41] <edgar-rft> Scheme rarely sees the light, Scheme programming is digging in the mud.
[03:56:06] <Zipheir> I can't make sense of that...
[03:56:46] <Zipheir> Something about a big ball of mud?
[04:00:04] <edgar-rft> In Scheme you never make it up to the top, that's why the top-level is still unexplored.
[04:02:45] <Zipheir> Hmm.  I'm still not entirely sure why the "top" level isn't called the "bottom".
[04:12:30] <tokie> i got almost all of the macros in r7 working on my syntax-rules impl now, which was a beer worthy accomplishment
[04:12:49] <tokie> it is -not fun- to debug when it doesn't work, because of how recursive they are

[13:23:39] <ns12> I mean, OCaml's Unix library works on Windows.
[13:24:07] <wasamasa> or looked at the code of POSIX shims for windows?
[13:24:14] <ns12> wasamasa: "have you ever worked with the win32 API?" - No. What point are you trying to make?
[13:24:47] <wasamasa> the win32 API is something that can only be experienced yourself
[13:25:28] <wasamasa> kind of like other atrocities in our field, such as SOAP, ASN.1 or even UTF-16
[13:25:44] <ecraven> is ASN.1 really that bad? I looked into BER, that seems... almost reasonable?

[13:30:24] <wasamasa> suppose CHICKEN's community is a few hundred people
[13:30:38] <wasamasa> then the amount of windows users is like a dozen at most

[13:32:29] <wasamasa> but overall, there's like 500 eggs in the coop
[13:33:17] <s-liao> What is the reason for the 94 broken eggs?
[13:33:43] <wasamasa> there are several
[13:33:43] <s-liao> I mean most likely.
[13:33:57] <wasamasa> such as eggs doing stuff like (system* "./foo")
[13:34:08] <wasamasa> that won't work on windows because wrong path separator
[13:34:19] <wasamasa> I've run into a few bugs with the .egg format
[13:34:24] <wasamasa> or missing windows build scripts
[13:34:29] <wasamasa> or quoting issues in the generated commands
[13:34:40] <wasamasa> or tests using POSIX features not implemented on win32, such as fork
[13:34:49] <wasamasa> or tests failing for no apparent reason
[13:34:58] <wasamasa> one of my eggs opened binary files without specifying binary mode
[13:35:07] <wasamasa> as it turns out, on POSIX platforms binary mode is always used
[13:35:52] <wasamasa> sometimes foreign dependencies were missing or not available
[13:37:00] <ns12> Is integer overflow possible in R7RS-small?
[13:39:34] <s-liao> As win32 API was in the zone at that time.Â  POSIX API was developing at the other cornerã€‚
[13:40:19] <wasamasa> see 6.2.3
[13:40:40] <wasamasa> there should be either an error or silent overflow into an inexact type
