[06:54:48] <linext> is there such a thing as a general RF meter that works on all frequencies?
[06:55:24] <linext> is this what i'm looking for? https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001569160097.html
[06:58:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> Define "all frequencies" and "general RF meter".     RF power detector diodes that go from VLF to X-band are definitely a "thing" these days, but the circuitry ahead of them?  Not necessarily broad band.

[07:54:58] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun: can you define for the class the difference between a “general RF meter” and an EMF meter?
[07:57:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> Well RF power meters are generally marketted to RF engineers, and are usually precision devices.  "EMF meters" are generally marketted to feeble-minded conspiracy theory types who think that 5G is going to cause us all to start eating babies.  Or something like that.   Although, to be fair, field-strength meters are RF power meters with different gain characteristics, and usually calibrated in V/meter, which is something that a
[07:57:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> broadcast engineer might are about when looking at transmitter coverage, etc.

[08:30:59] <muaddib[m]> I’ve had to use a field strength meter when working around high power RF stuff for regulatory safety compliance. It was in V/m. 
[08:30:59] <muaddib[m]> So on the other hand, an emf meter would be a good companion the the 5G safety guide I got with my ‘faraday sheet’?

[23:02:30] <muaddib[m]> I'm trying to build a flowgraph that updates a range slider for frequency when i double click on the spectrum in the GUI frequency or GUI Fosphor sink.
[23:02:30] <muaddib[m]> I'm using message pair to var to change the variable value. The current behavior is that the value of frequency updates when i double click, but the range slider and the value in the box next to the slider doesn't change. 
[23:02:30] <muaddib[m]> It would be cool to have the ability to double click on the spectrum somewhere and then fine tune the frequency with the range widget. 
[23:02:30] <muaddib[m]> Can QT Range widgets be 'moved' from separate blocks within the flowgraph?
