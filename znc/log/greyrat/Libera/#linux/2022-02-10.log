[01:19:45] <quartz> Hi. I reinstalled manjaro gnome the other day, and now my trackpad on my laptop is not working. Can't figure out why. libinput debug-events shows that the trackpad is there, but nothing happens when I use it. I can't figure out why. It worked a few days ago.
[01:19:46] <AeroNotix> it's pretty trivial to install, not sure why people techwank over the "difficulty"
[01:19:53] <mrfb> ayecee:  the original proposal when deltarpm where included in fedora https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Presto
[01:19:54] <tortal> gud är här för att stanna
[01:19:59] <AeroNotix> quartz: xev
[01:20:11] <quartz> AeroNotix: huh?
[01:20:18] <AeroNotix> quartz: check with xev
[01:20:21] <blackgatonegro> cause if you only download the updates instead of the entire file then it would do that. Like you have program X and you download the updates as a separate file. That means that every time the program loads it has to load the update file first...
[01:20:35] <ayecee> blackgatonegro: uh what
[01:20:38] <AeroNotix> blackgatonegro: uh what
[01:20:40] <AeroNotix> snap
[01:20:41] <quartz> AeroNotix: what is xev
[01:20:48] <AeroNotix> quartz: it's a program, to check input
[01:20:57] <AeroNotix> you could literally google this faster than I can explain it to you
[01:21:06] <mrfb> deltarpm are incremental rpm packages. There are few problems with them so it's not enabled by default
[01:21:09] <ayecee> blackgatonegro: the update files would replace the original files.
[01:21:13] <Cold_Cat> AeroNotix: I really have no idea what went wrong with this install. I thought I did everything correctly, but when I rebooted it had never installed onto the hard drive
[01:21:16] <tortal> Oh, but it would at a reasonable point create a ready binary that includes many updates
[01:21:29] <AeroNotix> blackgatonegro: you can think about it like an overlayfs
[01:21:35] <ananke> tortal: ohh, a service pack? :)
[01:21:37] <AeroNotix> in fact there are plenty of distros which do this

[01:22:06] <bq> gobolinux uses overlays not for upgrades per se but for version mixing
[01:22:17] <quartz> AeroNotix: OK i'll look into it, but libinput does not track any input from the trackpad,

[02:11:10] <octav1a> Hello, I have a software compile question. I have a software (in this case "R") that can install extension packages. Some of them need certain "development headers" to install. (in this case, cURL development libs) My question is whether these development headers are only used _while compiling_ or they must always be present to _run_ the extension library.  In other words, if I installed the curl-dev package (at a system level), then installed the RCurl
[02:11:10] <octav1a> library (as a user), and then uninstalled the system development headers, would the RCurl library still work or would it crash?

[03:42:02] <cluelessperson> auk, how so?
[03:42:02] <Nour> cluelessperson, ok how to design such ethernet frames? I expect something similar to mactelnet utility like in microtik can access device without assign ip config
[03:42:19] <auk> cluelessperson, (compiling/custom installing and config, RAM and disk requirements, resizing limitations...etc etc. ZFS sounds like a great "industry grade" fs but it just doesnt fit my use-case)

[03:42:54] <Lebela> I have multiple cameras of the same make/build/model  which have all the very same settings.   That means, that the output videos are identical.   My current workflow is:   1) Cut parts of the videos out  2)  change the colors / add subtitles / do some fading in  3)  concatenate them all together
[03:42:58] <cluelessperson> auk, for the most part you can "just install" zfs on linux without much manual work.
[03:43:05] <auk> I am incredibly confused how NILFS does not get mentioned more often, since it's part of mainline kernel and apparently packaged by default in debian, fedora etc
[03:43:12] *** Quits: muirrum (~muirrum@sourcehut/user/muirrum) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:43:15] <cluelessperson> but you're right, it's most useful to have ram/disks for it. :P
[03:43:43] <Lebela> the problem is,  that 2 new videos will be added now:   a) intro  b) end screen   -- they are computer generated  (different encoder / color scheme / etc.)
[03:43:51] <auk> cluelessperson, yeah i just dont have the hardware to make ZFS useful (e.g. on a single laptop). Also, for critical software, i really prefer packaged software for security reasons

[03:44:27] <auk> on linux, i mean
[03:44:33] <cluelessperson> auk, sure.
[03:44:49] <auk> cluelessperson, i mean distro-packaged, not external repos
[03:45:04] <rascul> zfs was distro packaged 3-4 years ago
[03:45:04] <Lebela> I got jumpy transitions between the "main video"  and the "end screen"  and the end screen was bad looking (colors off / smearing)
[03:45:22] <auk> rascul, ah, that must have been right after i was last looking into it

[05:06:35] <kurahaupo> auk: btrfs needs to reclaim space before changes can be made; deleting a file consists of making a new version of the directory, minus one name.

[07:02:39] <pnbeast> scottg489, normally you configure your BIOS to be able to boot from USB devices.  Depending on your hardware, there may be more to it.
[07:02:43] <znf> scottg489, you usually tell your firmware (BIOS/EFI) to boot from the USB drive, for temporary boots there's no need to involve Grub
[07:02:53] <scottg489> For instance in my /etc/default/grub file it specifies GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 which should mean it will immediately boot, but it doesn't. It waits 10 seconds on the grub menu
[07:03:15] <scottg489> pnbeast: znf: Yeah I want to be able to control that before I reboot
[07:03:22] *** Joins: donught (~donught@cpe-76-93-146-134.san.res.rr.com)

[07:03:35] <znf> F11/F12 are the usual ones

[07:04:07] <znf> You can always use efibootmgr
[07:04:25] <znf> the question is - how willing are you to experiment? and do you have a method of remote rebooting if you screw it up?
[07:04:38] <scottg489> I'm trying to automate an installation. I already have a USB drive which autoinstalls a distro simply by booting the drive, then it reboots into a machine ready to go
[07:05:00] <scottg489> znf: This is a throw away PC I'm working with so not worried about any kind of data loss
[07:05:09] <znf> the data loss is not the issue
[07:05:15] <scottg489> I have physical access as well
[07:05:19] <znf> being stuck in the bootloader without physical access is... :)
[07:05:35] <znf> then chainload the USB drive from grub2
[07:05:35] <scottg489> I just don't want to need to have physical access
[07:05:46] <znf> or switch the boot priorities with efibootmgr
[07:06:00] <znf> (assuming your system is EFI and not BIOS)
[07:06:11] <scottg489> This is a pretty old computer too. Like 10-15 years. That might predate EFI?
[07:06:28] <znf> auto-installing from USB is quite... unconventional :)

[08:08:09] <scottg489> lol wtf 6 lines?

[08:08:36] <znf> you edit the file, right?
[08:08:37] <scottg489> is it just 1 menuentry?
[08:08:48] <matsaman> most people don't know that just as with GRUB legacy, GRUB 2 does not require huge auto-generated messes of insanity a la grub-mkconfig
[08:08:51] <matsaman> scottg489: yeah

[08:09:41] <znf> you don't, obviously
[08:09:45] <gjvc> not like grub is used 24x7 during operation
[08:09:52] <matsaman> gjvc: indeed
[08:10:03] <znf> so what do you do when you install a new kernel and that new kernel fails?
[08:10:27] <matsaman> dunno, that's never happened in 17 years
[08:10:36] <matsaman> but I could edit from the grub menu and use the old kernel
[08:10:41] <znf> I've seen it happen on servers that people rent from us dozens of times
[08:10:43] <gjvc> i can believe that
[08:10:47] <matsaman> okay actually my grub.cfg is like 7 lines, there is a vmlinuz.old secondary entry

[08:11:27] <kurahaupo> znf: My hand-edited grub.cfg always keeps the stanza for the current working kernel whenever I try anything else. But realistically, I only use grub 2 or 3 times a year on average, and some years not at all.
[08:11:38] <matsaman> znf: it's not experience, it's just realization that it's a simple text file

[08:13:16] <znf> the meaning of those 6 lines is... complicated :)
[08:13:23] <znf> no need to flex your knowledge
[08:13:34] <kurahaupo> I've my own written scripts that generate apache and exim config files, because it gets tedious to do by hand
[08:13:35] <znf> ubuntu, rhel and so on have different systems/ways in place to handle automation
[08:13:46] <gjvc> kurahaupo: that's the way!
[08:14:03] <kurahaupo> And my workflow doesn't fit the assumptions made by the generators that other people have written.
[08:14:29] <znf> and it's overall simpler to work along your distributions way of doing things than to do it your own way
[08:14:30] <matsaman> znf: you don't need to understand the meaning, but it's not that complicated
[08:14:37] <matsaman> znf: that's true
[08:14:44] <lockywolf_> What do people here use for IMAP IDLE monitoring?
[08:14:56] <matsaman> but given the choice, I would eschew Ubuntu's approach, as overly complicated
[08:15:17] <znf> it's really not
[08:15:28] <znf> there's a /etc/defaults/grub which controls some variables
[08:15:32] <matsaman> it's massively more complicated
[08:15:46] <znf> and then ther's the structure in /etc/grub.d that does some magic
[08:15:48] <matsaman> one file vs lots of files, 7 lines vs probably a hundred
[08:15:58] <matsaman> for a file that likely never needs to be altered after installation
[08:16:02] <scottg489> I mean I'd saying grub.cfg's are overly complicated

[15:15:55] <RayTracer> Schrostfutz: and just to exclude one reason I'm aware of, is your client WSL? Because ssh-agent didn't work for some time on that (now it does)

[21:23:35] <tirnanog> to break it down a little further, the assignment that precedes envsubst has the shell define OLD_PASSWORD in envsubst's environment. that's how it knows the value to replace with, meanwhile, the parameter '$OLD_PASSWORD' tells envsubst "don't replace anything in the input stream other than $OLD_PASSWORD'. if you want to operate on multiple variables, they can be space-separated, as was shown in the
[21:23:37] <tirnanog> earlier example.

Because Cassandra has multiple replicas and transparent failover, it is preferable for a replica to be killed immediately when memory is low rather than go into swap. This allows traffic to be immediately redirected to a functioning replica instead of continuing to hit the replica that has high latency due to swapping. If your system has a lot of DRAM, swapping still lowers
[22:02:12] <XV8> performance significantly because the OS swaps out executable code so that more DRAM is available for caching disks."

Does it have to iterate through all threads to locate those of the same process?

[23:57:16] <mrfb> Kim^J: don't get me wrong I like rust, but I find kind of funny when people sell a piece of software as "Written in rust!"

[23:57:33] <msiism> For all package managers I know, Alpine's APK is pretty ace. It still has a few rough edges – as these things do – but it's pretty nice overall.

[23:59:08] <mrfb> puff: but that's understandable, written in C++ means that all the team ended in a nuthouse, so has merit
