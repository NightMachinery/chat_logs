[01:41:23] <Guest12> try that again
[01:45:31] <Guest12> I think my setup is misconfigured, but i can't figure out how. I'm trying to get Qutebrowser to work in wayland and although i'm running `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland  qutebrowser` it gives an error `Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.` I was wondering if someone knows what's going on here.
[01:45:58] <The-Compiler> Guest12: do you have qt.force_platform set in the qutebrowser config perhaps?
[01:46:10] <The-Compiler> Guest12: try with -s qt.force_platform wayland
[01:49:08] <Guest12> see, now that works.
[01:49:08] <Guest12> but when i set it in .config/qutebrowser/config it errors out with `bad config`, even though i'm just uncommenting something
[01:49:15] <Guest12> maybe my config file needs updating

[01:50:50] <The-Compiler> Guest12: do you mean config.py? What's the error?
[01:51:25] <Guest12> `name 'wayland' is not defined`
[01:51:43] <Guest12> this is a fairly old install, although i've stayed up to date
[01:51:57] <Guest12> and yes, config.py
[01:52:08] <The-Compiler> That sounds like you're using wayland as a Python variable rather than "wayland" as a string
[01:52:39] <The-Compiler> See https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc
[01:54:12] <Guest12> i put it as "wayland" in config.py and it worked, that's really weird
[01:54:31] <rj1> i hope the memory leak issue  for wayland can be fixed soon
[01:54:34] <Guest12> i don't remember removing any quotes there
[01:54:34] <Guest12> something was screwy with my setup like i thought, i guess
[01:54:40] <rj1> i don't think its a qutebrowser-specific issue though
[01:55:47] <Guest12> anyway The-Compiler thanks for always being there

[18:13:58] <ThinkT510> I still find it really impressive how much they've done. a whole OS including a graphical web browser from scratch.
[18:14:14] <ThinkT510> I really enjoy watching their progress videos
[18:14:37] <ThinkT510> they seem to have a lot of fun with the project
[18:14:52] <chrisb> toofar: so put the scripts in .local/share/qutebrowser/greasemonkey and see what happens?
[18:14:54] <ThinkT510> but yes, the browser isn't ready for primetime yet

[19:30:02] <hvxgr> abff: keir:  (Re "save the source") I'll try to verify this- appears that the source is javascript and the javascript runs to create a text report, which is visible in 'view source'. If I look at the webpage w/o view source and then download, I only get the javascript, no the text report.  Again, I will try to review/confirm this "story" later.
[19:30:55] <abff> Oh I see, I hate the web so much :)
