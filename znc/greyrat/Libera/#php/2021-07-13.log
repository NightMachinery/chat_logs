[00:35:41] <Sammitch> one app, one user. all those other things you said are good ideas _on top_ of that.
[00:37:37] <discape> Sammitch: so can open_basedir be worked around, without using functions like exec, passthru, shell_exec, system, proc_open, popen, and dl ?
[00:38:04] <Sammitch> if you're only running one app, then you can just run it as httpd if you want, but it also won't hurt to get in the habit of isolation by default
[00:38:26] <discape> I'm hosting multiple websites with potentially untrusted code.
[00:39:06] <Sammitch> open_basedir only controls what PHP is willing to look at. if the user escapes into the shell they can look at whatever's available to that user
[00:39:52] <discape> But if I disable the above mentioned functions, wouldn't it be impossible to escape?
[00:40:14] <Sammitch> it would be difficult, yes.
[00:40:52] <__adrian> "discape> I'm hosting multiple websites with potentially untrusted code"  then don't run them on the same server
[00:41:08] <Sammitch> *handwaves in the general direction of containers*
[00:41:12] <__adrian> run VMs or containers
[00:42:30] <discape> Thanks for the advice, but I just want to know if open_basedir would be insecure, or more insecure than a separate user, assuming I disable all the exec functions?
[00:43:09] <Sammitch> it's not an either-or proposition
[00:43:16] <Sammitch> you can do both.
[00:44:55] <discape> Aight, got it.
[00:47:07] <__adrian> own user = better
[00:47:59] <__adrian> not either/or, as Sammitch says, but "own user" is the one you should do _first_ and be more sure about

[00:50:54] <discape> So if I make a new user and a new php-fpm pool, does the user set in the .conf file need the same privileges as the php-fpm engine, or does it mean the priveleges it has when including and otherwise accessing files?
[00:53:24] <discape> Since the code uses mail(), would the user need execute access to /usr/bin/sendmail?

[01:18:47] <BadAdviceCat> discape, all users generally have access to /usr/bin
[01:19:00] <BadAdviceCat> Why do that when you can use SMTP?
[01:19:40] <BadAdviceCat> And I would go about using an email library, unless you like dealing with header injection and a bunch of other baggage that comes with it.
[01:20:13] <discape> BadAdviceCat I know, I'm just asking what privileges it needs.
[01:20:30] <discape> I'm assuming it needs everything that the php engine needs.
[01:21:50] <BadAdviceCat> Generally, you don't want Web server having write/owner privileges on files. Limit http's ability to see stuff to the http public folder.
[01:22:17] <BadAdviceCat> As for PHP, things are as secure as the code written itself.
[01:22:42] <BadAdviceCat> For example, is the script written to deal with directory traversal?
[01:24:01] <BadAdviceCat> I would want to run the potentially untrusted code in a VM/container. :)

[02:05:29] <BadAdviceCat> discape, if you can't trust it, don't run the code at all. For example, you can look for an alternative software to run, like if you got a old forum script, replace it with something new and trusted. https://flarum.org/
[02:06:34] <BadAdviceCat> I know it may be difficult to do than to say it, but what choice do you have? You may end up losing features in exhcnage for something better and more secure.
[02:07:17] <discape> lets put it this way: I trust the code enough that I would let it run as its own user with no extra permissions
[02:07:29] <BadAdviceCat> How important is it? What can go wrong? What are the consequences if you still decide to use old/untrusted code?
[02:08:07] <BadAdviceCat> discape, I would suggest reading through a few tutorials about how to secure a server.
[02:08:16] <discape> Would you recommend one?
[02:09:23] <BadAdviceCat> Generally, unless the third party Plugins/add-ons are from good reputable source (MEANING that they are known for writing good SECURE code, and not the same publishers/authors who get hacked every 5 seconds and Not address security issues)
[02:10:42] <BadAdviceCat> discape, you have to google it. Not only that, you need to read multiple websites that explains how to do this. You would need to do ti for each software involved. For example: Nginx, Ubuntu, apparmor.
[02:11:36] <discape> Yeah, of course, I was just asking incase you knew a specific one.
[02:11:44] <biberu> discape: it'll be hard for anyone to give good advice without knowing the threat. are you trying to limit the impact your baby brother has on the server under the bed?
[02:13:08] <discape> I just want to know a small technicality. If I set the user for a php-fpm pool, will that user be used to run the actual engine, which needs access to system libraries, or will it be only for the code, which only needs access to the directory it is inside of.
[02:13:58] <discape> I'm pretty sure it's the former, I just want to make sure.
[02:14:27] <BadAdviceCat> And then google search for a list of tools that can help keep your website secure, and to monitor the activity of your server. For example, multiple different IDS (Intrusion detection system) - Some are necessary, and some are not, depending on how you are hosting it, how the network is setup and your responsibilities (e.g. are you responsible for securing that network? Or are you just some random bloke/lass renting a VPS?)
[02:15:04] <biberu> discape: sorry, don't know
[02:15:44] <discape> thanks for the advice though, appreciate it.
[02:17:20] <BadAdviceCat> discape, I would learn how to use apparmor/selinux if you hadn't already, and figure out IDS like snort/tripwire if I were you.
[02:17:34] <discape> I'm just a random bloke trying to build a web hosting service. I'm totally fine with allowing the php-fpm process to access everything a normal user can access, but if it doesn't strictly need to, all the better.
[02:17:57] <BadAdviceCat> Just what I can think about from the top of my head. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert at it.
[02:18:29] <discape> Ehh, I can just test it, see if it results in an error
[02:18:31] <BadAdviceCat> You got a crap ton of reading to do then. If you're providing the hosting service.
[02:18:50] <discape> You, ikr, so much reading.

[03:34:39] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.
