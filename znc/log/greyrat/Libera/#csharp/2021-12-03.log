[02:22:35] <canton7> I'm sure I opened an issue about that at some point, but I can't find it: the compiler's pretty bad about adding redundant 'v.HasValue' checks, e.g. 'val == 1' compiles to '(num.GetValueOrDefault() == num2) & num.HasValue', when the 'HasValue' check is unnecessary

[02:30:06] <canton7> val.GetValueOrDefault() == 0, (val ?? 0) == 0, 'or val is 0 or null'
[02:30:08] <DevJohnC> HasValue is how you check for null on a Nullable<T>
[02:30:53] <DevJohnC> null and 0 aren't the same, so if you want 0 to be equal to null... why even use nullable<t>

[02:40:35] <Nasp> Do you always has .HasValue?
[02:40:41] <MaNa2k> canton7, hmm, not getting the effect i wanted. check this paste. want someting like that, its a special case which is why i wnat to test against null and zero. Want that in a single line or in shorted possible form inside a lambda .Where(here). https://pastebin.com/gDrqgGmp
[02:41:25] <Nasp> Do you always has .HasValue?

[02:42:45] <Nasp> Do you have a list of companies where some dont have an id?
[02:42:50] <Nasp> Because why set it to 0 then
[02:42:56] <MaNa2k> i actually copied the method name from another extention method
[02:43:01] <MaNa2k> and modified it slightly
[02:43:07] <MaNa2k> forgot it had or
[02:43:09] <Nasp> Either a companyid is set or not
[02:43:16] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: IsNullOrZero() == val ?? 0 == 0
[02:43:27] <Nasp> organizationId.HasValue?
[02:47:16] <_genuser_> omg JakeSays that's so cruel.
[02:47:57] <MaNa2k> canton7, just saw you posted the earlier damn, tha was powerfull "x.companyDbId is 0 or null"
[02:48:27] <Nasp> I still dont get why you want to filter out 0
[02:48:45] <_genuser_> Nasp business cases are almost always illogical
[02:48:56] <Nasp> But i think it's a mistake
[02:49:09] <gufi__> because normally 0 in db is not valid for an identifier
[02:49:12] <MaNa2k> Nasp, its because we are building a select graphql query
[02:49:52] <MaNa2k> and if the dbid is 0, then it will not return anything
[02:50:20] <MaNa2k> so we want to exclude those items that has 0 dbid
[02:50:27] <MaNa2k> same with companydbid
[02:50:29] <_genuser_> MaNa2k you lost my interest a graphql....
[02:51:11] <Nasp> MaNa2k: So, why would anyone ask for 0?
[02:51:19] <MaNa2k> graphql is really not that difficult, the problem is you need some serious insight on the erp that has implemented it
[02:51:21] <Nasp> Is'nt it the same if someone asks for 1234
[02:51:22] <Nasp> Or -1?
[02:52:10] <gufi__> in some cases -1 is valid because its uint32.maxvalue =D
[02:52:16] <MaNa2k> Nasp, probably no one, its just a safe mecanism
[02:52:17] <JakeSays> Nasp: because anyone is an idiot
[02:52:44] <MaNa2k> insase 0.00001% of the population does it
[02:52:47] <MaNa2k> incase
[02:53:06] <Nasp> But is this user input?
[02:53:23] <Nasp> gufi__ Is'nt it invalid if uint?
[02:53:45] <gufi__> depends on the parser but if it got past that it could be cast as uint and be fine
[02:54:00] <gufi__> since identifiers in db's should always be the unsigned version of integers
[02:55:41] <Nasp> You mean signed right?
[02:55:54] <gufi__> no... unsigned
[02:56:04] <gufi__> for a db identifier negative has no meaning
[02:56:20] <Nasp> I know, but doesn't most recommendations says like for a userid, just use an int and not a uint
[02:56:24] <Nasp> Even though uint might make more sense
[02:56:57] <gufi__> uint always makes more sense, you dont run out of integers as fast in the even that some one only gave enough room for ints ( dumb but whatever it happens for 'space savings' )
[02:57:15] <gufi__> no one ever gives an id of -2, auto increment doesn't roll over
[02:57:20] <sysRPL> currently i am writing an svg demo that turns your svg drawing into a physcis simulation, complete with bodies, liquid, motors, springs, hinges and so on
[02:57:41] <Nasp> uint is not that much bigger that it matters

[03:59:42] <Shariff> I declared something, that I now want to use.. and it seems a bit magical to me, right now
[04:03:19] <Flonk> Shariff, You can do another AddSingleton which uses your userdata, like so: `class Foo { Foo (IUserDataObject userData) { .... } }`, and then builder.Services.AddSingleton<Foo>();
[04:03:36] <Flonk> Shariff, dependency injection will just fill in Foo's constructor for you.
[04:03:44] <Shariff> Oh.. so that's the magic
[04:04:36] <Shariff> I was 'running around my code' trying to nail down where I needed to add what to the constructor.. which then dawned on me that it completely destroyed the usefulness of DI, since I was manually adding everything...  :)

[05:06:09] <DevJohnC> no because you pass cancellation token with the WithCancellation(ct) method on the IAsyncEnumerable<T>
[05:06:26] <jonp> ah
[05:06:32] <DevJohnC> like: await foreach (var row in asyncStream.WithCancellation(ct)) { ... }

[08:17:28] <ezioadf> I have an ancient ASP.Net Framework server.  It's serving an AngularJs app, but one of the paths /application, we're looking to replace with an Angular application.  It's almost like we want to keep the ancient nav, header, footer, and proxy inject the new Angular app into the middle.  Thoughts?
[08:21:53] <bkool> ezioadf, i love how you use 'ancient' i still have to support a massive legacy WebForms application.
[08:22:27] <ezioadf> What if I told you it was ASP.Net 2.
[08:24:13] <ezioadf> It's not. :) But what if I told you that.  lel.
[08:24:32] <ezioadf> it's 4.6.  But still ... 10 year old app.
[08:24:37] <bkool> that would be hard core bro. ;)
[08:25:00] <bkool> 4.6?! that's 'modern'
[08:25:49] <ezioadf> If you consider that we upgraded throughout the 10 years.  It's actually more like 15 years, but the last 10 years of upgrades were done contemporaneously.
[08:29:27] <ezioadf> Question to everyone: When do you think SOLID became mainstream?  When do you think it became integral to .Net?
[08:30:26] <bkool> way better than us. .net MVC is a lot easier to convert .net core. but WebForms, we are so screwed.
[08:31:39] <ezioadf> That shit's ancient, but the reasons for upgrading are self-evident and cost saving.
[08:31:45] <bkool> ezioadf, SOLID was taught to me in college in early 00's. so been around awhile. yeah it dates me.
[08:32:04] <ezioadf> Yeah.  I agree.  It's been TAUGHT for a long time, but only recently adopted.
[08:34:13] <bkool> well, it's not a bad principal to adhere to? i think it's been adopted for longer than you think.
[08:35:24] <bkool> ezioadf, unfortunately you can't upgrade at some point a code base is a complete rewrite.
[08:35:59] <ezioadf> No.  I would absolutely disagree with that.  SOLID programming is less than a decade old in PHP and .Net.  And sorry, but PHP beat you to the punch.
[08:37:05] <ezioadf> bkool, You can write new modules in anything.  The right way.  You can Frankenstein some wicked shit over time.
[08:37:56] <bkool> oh we have that.
[08:38:07] <bkool> Webforms + Vue.js
[08:38:52] <ezioadf> Well more than just that.  Next time you have to write a new module or upgrade something ... write it in whatever you want.  That's what I'm doing now.
[08:39:47] <ezioadf> I mean, I might be a retard, but I got pretty good at that shit when I got hired for ZF work and they were on ZF1 and I was in ZF3.

[08:41:54] <ezioadf> But I just got the ZF3 shit to forget about the ZF1 shit, and it worked. The concept worked.  We could keep the old shit and introduce new shit.  Just no one wanted to start doing ZF3.
[08:42:35] <ezioadf> That was back in 2016 and I've got a lot better at it, though prolly a lot of people here would still call me a retard.

[08:54:06] <ezioadf> Noice.  Obsolete the other shit over time.  Just make sure you keep the two things completely fucking separate (in my experience).
[08:54:23] <ezioadf> Which gets me back to me.
[08:54:37] <ezioadf> I want to inject this new app.
[08:55:23] <ezioadf> I've thought maybe I could just copy the header and footer.  We rarely change that.  In fact.  I think I've never had to.  So maybe /application is a totally different application.
[08:56:03] <ezioadf> Maybe that's the answer.  Then I could TRULY proxy it.
[08:56:38] <ezioadf> The only thing I would need to do in that case is get a hold of the auth token.
[08:56:54] <ezioadf> I mean no matter what I do, I need that fuckin token.

[13:39:46] <jmer> Well triggers CAN become total crap if you're not careful

[13:39:49] <MatthiasVance> j/k it's the smarter choice I think

[13:40:34] <Nasp> There you can hook in before the save

[14:33:44] <jmer> so it's not like they're adhering to it religiously but the incentives / yearly bonus is tied to these KPIs

[14:34:01] <Kim^J> The "joy" of new features fades really really fast
[14:34:06] <Nasp> 90% Just seems rather high like if the product have gone in maintaince mode only, time for a new job

[15:34:10] <moose> There should be angled entrances/exit paths to ensure flow of traffic, yield signs, arrows, and guiding lane lines
[15:34:31] <moose> And the article is just plain wrong, roundabouts are very common in the US
[15:34:50] <MatthiasVance> So not 7000 in the entire country?
[15:34:55] <MatthiasVance> Because there are 7000 just in this city

[15:36:15] <pandem> Carmel now has more than 138 roundabouts, more than any other city in the United States.

[15:51:07] <jmer> I never saw any of those movies. I think it's a stupid premise for a book.
[15:51:12] <moose> If you were expecting excellent sexy things or a deep plot, then yeah it's pretty lame

[16:02:55] <moose> It doesn't have sufficient durability for high value transactions

[16:03:24] <moose> I don't use MySQL.
[16:03:32] <moose> I use Microsoft SQL Server.
[16:03:32] <jmer> oh ok. I just got that impression
[16:03:39] <moose> I prefer MSSQL over everything.
[16:03:48] <jmer> If it HAS to be free I would pick pgsql, but yeah I prefer SQL Server.
[16:03:52] <moose> I think without a doubt it's probably the best RDBMS out right now, if price is no option
[16:04:03] <moose> I'd pick MariaDB for free stuff.
[16:04:11] <jmer> it's what I have the most experience with, which ofc. colors my view on the subject :P
[16:04:18] <moose> I like transactions.
[16:04:22] <moose> I leverage stored procedures.
[16:04:33] <moose> Output parameters are also very important to me.
[16:04:39] <moose> Security constraints on stored procedures are vital to my work.
[16:05:54] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Yes and also "how easy is it to manage"
[16:06:19] <moose> pgsql lacks locking mechanisms that are in the queries really, too
[16:06:20] <MatthiasVance> (which is related to your experience level of course)
[16:06:20] <jmer> MatthiasVance: Almost with no exception whenever you pick something opensource management burden increases. That's just the way of things.
[16:06:25] <moose> You have to pull advisory locks to get locking performance
[16:06:26] <moose> It's awful
[16:07:35] <moose> I like MySQL for the select for update behavior and MSSQL for UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK
[16:07:48] <moose> pgsql doesn't maintain ACID for those
[16:07:51] <MatthiasVance> Let me put some more hydrocholoric acid into my eye
[16:08:10] <moose> MatthiasVance: I am quite knowledgeable of the database things, I am sorry the queries look like shite
[16:08:13] <moose> But lock hints are not the devil
[16:08:28] <MatthiasVance> moose: I meant that literally.. I had an eye surgery a week ago
[16:08:34] <moose> Yes I know
[16:08:36] <MatthiasVance> ah
[16:08:43] <moose> I didn't know you meant it literally, though
[16:08:44] <moose> The latter, yes
[16:09:02] <moose> They really have you put HCl in your eye? I think that would do quite some damage
[16:10:06] <MatthiasVance> Yes it's a component
[16:10:17] <moose> Ah.
[16:10:33] <jmer> moose: I've never had the need for deep groking the various query hints. In Denmark it's rare to hit something large enough to not be considdered a "toy" database xD

[16:12:06] <jmer> Includes Calcium, good for your bones
[16:12:33] <moose> jmer: Ah, I used to work for a financial company and did quite a bit of MSSQL tuning for the DB that holds 1/3 of all of the transactions globally :p
[16:12:54] <jmer> I've done a bit of tuning here and there, but the need only arose because of shitty DB modelling
[16:12:56] <moose> It's quite surprising how much partitioning can help
[16:13:02] <jmer> haha yes
[16:13:05] <moose> Also how slow indexes can make inserts
[16:13:13] <moose> Especially with like 1 billion records in a damn table
[16:13:17] <jmer> yeah.
[16:13:32] <jmer> I think the biggest I've worked with was 15 million EANs

[16:13:51] <moose> Now it sounds like we live together.
[16:13:54] <moose> I would like to clarify, we do not.
[16:13:55] <jmer> I mean 15 million rows representating an EAN
[16:14:11] <jmer> moose: I can think of worse people to live with than either you or MatthiasVance
[16:14:18] <moose> Oh, certainly
[16:14:36] <MatthiasVance> moose: Trafloxal
[16:17:27] <moose> Nothing I can find shows that it has HCl but I can think of one compelling reason for it. It's a fluoroquinolone and it needs low-ish pH to have the proper uptake to be effective.
[16:18:20] <moose> That is a smart idea to add a tiny tiny bit of dilute HCl to prevent blocking quinolones from concentrating enough I guess.
[16:18:49] <moose> They rely on being concentrated in an infection site directly, unlike systemic antibiotics.
[16:19:02] <moose> Depends on the administration :p
[16:19:36] <moose> [Southern accent] If you got the meningitis or the wuhan virus just take a whole bunch of quinolones in your veins like an addict. It'll fix ya right up.

[17:13:14] <MaNa2k> so i have a property class which i can not modify, but i need to add a property for holding index count of that item. is it possible to inject a property on runtime or something?
[17:14:02] <MaNa2k> so wheneveri add an object of that type into a list, i also have to increment the index and add that new count value
[17:14:07] <tlf> in php I have an $arr = [0,1,2,3] and can reference by $arr[0], in c# I have list = {0,1,2}, is it possible to reference an item without using a loop?

[17:16:05] <MaNa2k> in c#
[17:16:45] <MaNa2k> if thats what you're wondering
[17:16:49] <tlf> let me rewrite that. in php I'd have $arr = ["asdf","123"]
[17:17:28] <tlf> actually it'd be more like $arr = ["asdf"=>"foo","123"=>15], I could call $arr["asdf"] and get "foo"
[17:18:07] <MaNa2k> you can do that with dictionary
[17:20:50] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@187.18.140.125)
[17:20:57] <MaNa2k> but dictionary cant have dupes
[17:21:06] <MaNa2k> or maybe it can, if you modify your dict
[17:21:50] <MaNa2k> or was it maybe List<KeyValuePair<string, string>> you should use
[17:23:08] * MatthiasVance dupes MaNa2k 
[17:23:32] <BSaboia> MaNa2k, what you wrote is better than extending a dictionary IMHO
[17:23:53] <BSaboia> For a "dictionary" with dupes (which is a contradiction in terms anyways)
[17:24:27] <MaNa2k> tlf: https://www.dotnetperls.com/keyvaluepair
[17:24:35] <BSaboia> So instead of a dictionary, what you want is a list of key-value pairs, so exactly what you wrote
[17:26:06] <MaNa2k> but the question is if he can get his key like you can with dict
[17:26:15] <MaNa2k> ["blabal"]
[17:26:22] <jonp> why not Dictionary<string, List<TValue>>?
[17:26:26] <jonp> if you need multiple values
[17:26:27] <MaNa2k> * arr["blabal"]
[17:26:49] <MaNa2k> jonp, thats just mindfuck for newbiews
[17:26:52] <MaNa2k> :P
[17:26:58] <jonp> a problem with List<KeyValuePair<‚Ä¶>> is that you have O(n) lookup times
[17:27:00] <bomb> hot AF -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KJeERXpVH8
[17:27:13] <jonp> so if key lookup time is important or the list isn't "small", that may be important
[17:27:52] <tlf> what I'm trying to accompluish
[17:28:04] <tlf> in php, I could $query = query(get results); which would return an array
[17:28:13] <Lukky> I guess if you were to write your own equality comparer for a dictionary, then you could have "duplicate" keys...
[17:28:20] <tlf> I could call specific values without having to loop through, simply by $results['key'];
[17:28:34] <jonp> Lukky: no; if you want "dupes", use a List<T> value
[17:28:36] <tlf> Im trying to do that same thing, but with c#. not sure if thats possible
[17:29:03] <tlf> if I throw my query into a list<t>, I can't/do not know how to pull it in the same fashion
[17:29:06] <jonp> tlf: i think the question above is what does `$results['key']` contain when e.g. the URL has multiple keys
[17:29:24] <jonp> example.com?key=foo&key=bar&key=baz‚Ä¶
[17:29:46] <tlf> I see your point
[17:29:51] <jonp> do you expect `$results['key']` to have just e.g. baz?  or a list? or‚Ä¶?
[17:30:10] <tlf> off the top of my head, Im not sure what php would return actually
[17:30:23] <tlf> I would assume you'd grab the first item
[17:30:28] <tlf> s/you'd/it
[17:30:31] <jonp> i'd assume first or last
[17:30:32] <jonp> but not a list

[18:06:29] <MatthiasVance> I mean I might want to row a bit

[20:00:32] <_genuser_> omg people stop using _ for private var names!
[20:00:37] <_genuser_> it's so supid!
[20:00:40] <jonp> it's great!
[20:01:08] <_genuser_> in a sea of names, where every other type of var/name is text, and vars are camel case, that stupid _ is so jarring.
[20:01:40] <jonp> i find "unaligned" text to be more annoying.
[20:01:48] <jonp> but very few like my code formatting convention
[20:01:56] <_genuser_> jonp if you had twitter, I'd tweet a slightly wise-crakck'y tweet at you!!!!
[20:01:59] <jonp> likely too much work, especially when the IDE keeps shitting all over it.
[20:03:27] <_genuser_> some members of my team worked at a microsoft project. and now want everyone to follow their preferences because "microsoft"
[20:03:41] <_genuser_> braces go on new lines. _ everywhere. and other stupidity.
[20:03:49] <jonp> i'm not fond of "official" Microsoft preferences either
[20:03:56] <jonp> `{` shouldn't be on a new line all the time.
[20:04:09] <jonp> really, only for methods & class decls.
[20:04:20] <jonp> properties? same line.  `if` & loops? same line.
[20:04:37] <_genuser_> for anything. I prefer the brace to be on the same line.
[20:05:00] <jonp> oh, and what about formatting of "multi-line parameters"?
[20:05:07] <_genuser_> I also dislike the whole, eVeRY blOcK mUsT HaVE brAceS!!!!! attitude of my team.
[20:05:12] <jonp> ugh, so many possible flame wars
[20:05:47] <_genuser_> jonp multi lines params the first goes on a new line too. (I'm like ok, I don't mind this one too much. but generally the first one goes on the same line).
[20:06:07] <jonp> my complaint is about *indentation*
[20:06:13] <jonp> do you "align" the indent with the opening `(`?
[20:06:24] <jonp> or do you do ~2 "tab stops" for everything, method name length be damned?
[20:06:34] <jonp> one of those is "nice" to code refactoring/method renaming.
[20:06:38] <jonp> the other is fugly & painful
[20:06:54] <_genuser_> I personally prefer 2 spaces over from the starting line. with the opening brace at the end of the last line of that multi-line params circus.
[20:07:19] <_genuser_> but the team prefers 4 spaces over from first line. and the { on aligned back with the first line of the method signature.
[20:08:06] <_genuser_> I still can't figure out why these people prefer 4 spaces. No tabs.
[20:08:27] <_genuser_> it would be so much easier if we all just used tabs. your personal VS can then adjust tab to be 2 or 4 spaces.
[20:08:30] <_genuser_> but no, it must be 4 spaces.
[20:08:50] <jonp> _genuser_: just inform them that it's an accessibility problem.
[20:08:53] <jonp> tabs are better than spaces.
[20:09:13] <jonp> HHOS: https://adamtuttle.codes/blog/2021/tabs-vs-spaces-its-an-accessibility-issue/
[20:09:20] <_genuser_> hmm, might try that next time.
[20:09:43] <_genuser_> and a link with documentation from a third party. that's a great idea.
[20:09:44] <jonp> which wasn't the argument when my cohort decided on tabs ~20 years ago‚Ä¶
[20:09:53] <jonp> but it's still a nice argument
[20:10:45] <_genuser_> IMO, let the IDE display tab as a number of spaces you're comfortable with. And then just use tab. that argument makes sense.
[20:10:59] <_genuser_> I'd also prefer if VS were to auto format each file everytime it opens it.
[20:11:16] <jonp> ugh, i'm glad it doesn't.
[20:11:28] <_genuser_> that ways each person's own formatting rules get applied to the same codebase WHEN they want to look at it.
[20:12:14] <_genuser_> if your formatting didn't have options for it in VS options, then you're right it would screw up your code layout everytime.
[20:12:38] <_genuser_> or if it was an option to turn that feature on/off. (autoformat on file-open [checkbox])
[20:13:20] <_genuser_> althought it would ruin code check-in. those changes would all be considered code changes.

[20:30:14] <Nasp> Oh well lets just leave it
[20:30:16] <jonp> Nasp: something like that
[20:30:21] <jonp> i DO want braces on most things
[20:30:36] <jonp> even if it's a one-line `if` + return
[20:30:41] <Nasp> Atleast property get doesn't require it new
[20:30:45] <Nasp> With the new expression setup
[20:30:54] <Nasp> I can accept single line returns
[20:30:59] <Nasp> But else no, always a new line
[20:31:21] <brianonymous> we have a braces always policy as well

[20:34:14] <Nasp> I find that a unified nice style makes it easier to read
[20:34:43] <jonp> i find it easier if everyone gets off their damn high horse. :-)
[20:34:52] <jonp> unless you 100% only work with your own code
[20:35:00] <jonp> you'll ALWAYS hit some "contrary" code convention
[20:35:02] <jonp> deal with it
[20:35:06] <jonp> learn to read them all
[20:38:17] <Nasp> Code should be art, not a piece of garbage really
[20:38:43] <brianonymous> team shared formatters are magical
[20:38:50] <Nasp> Like some people dont even have a style and it's just different through an entire codebase, even a class the've been the only one workign on
[20:39:18] <tlf> ok, Im sorry. I've spent too long messing this up
[20:39:38] <tlf> Im just trying to simply debug.writeline a variable, and all I get is Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.EntityQueryable`1[System.String]

[20:41:50] <tlf> Debug.WriteLine("File path: "+ FilePathsQuery.ToString());
[20:42:07] <MizMahem> well nothing. But that is how a lot of Enumerables.ToString
[20:42:09] *** Joins: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96)
[20:42:12] <jonp> Nasp: yes, code should be art.
[20:42:16] <jonp> fuck code formatters
[20:42:26] <MizMahem> try `string.Join(`,`, enumerable);`
[20:42:32] <jonp> (i'm a special snowflake)
[20:42:39] <MizMahem> er...
[20:42:49] <jonp> tlf: that type didn't override the .ToString() method
[20:42:49] <MizMahem> try `string.Join(',', enumerable)`
[20:42:53] <Nasp> jonp: It depends on what you mean with code formatters
[20:42:57] <jonp> so what you're seeing is the default implementation
[20:43:01] <Nasp> As in auto formatting, or ones that just helps you formatting
[20:43:14] <Nasp> Because i hear from many who just want auto formatters setup with git commit hooks, and i find that sooo confusing
[20:43:15] <jonp> given my preferred style is "idiosyncratic", "yes"
[20:43:52] <Nasp> I think certain rules should never be violated
[20:43:58] <Nasp> Then some are up to the developers discression
[20:44:03] <tlf> MizMahem, nope
[20:45:13] <MizMahem> nope?
[20:45:24] * MizMahem shrugs.
[20:45:47] <MizMahem> I forget if string.Join has an IEnumerable overload. You might have to do `ToArray` or something.
[20:46:45] <jonp> it does in some versions
