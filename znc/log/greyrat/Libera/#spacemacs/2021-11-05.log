[01:09:40] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @dillydog_gitlab Finally, I got  `org-mode` installed from ELPA. So you should delete the "org" archive from `configuration-layer/create-elpa-repository` AND also from the  `.lock` file in your `.emacs.d` dir. Then you can add `:location elpa :min-version "9.5"` to the `org` package declaration of you org layer's `packages.el` file... I guess it should install the package after pressing `SPC f e R`
[01:15:01] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> Great news! Thanks for the tip. I wonder if a change like this is worth a PR. I think a lot of people would benefit from the latest org.
[01:18:38] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Yes I guess I will prepare a PR soon

[16:16:53] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> hey all, I am trying to get another grip with spacemacs
[16:17:15] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> one thing I have in my `.spacemacs` is the following line
[16:17:43] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> `(shell :variables shell-default-shell 'shell)`
[16:17:55] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> now, it's even a miracle I can make it work
[16:18:41] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> but I do have a working shell when I do  `SPC '` which I can do to use a terminal inside emacs
[16:18:48] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> one thing I do not understand though
[16:19:35] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> say I am in the integrated shell itself and run something into an emacs buffer what can I do?
[16:19:52] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> because in my debian I have an alias for emacs that works
[16:20:04] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> but in emacs itself, in its own shelf
[16:21:05] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> That's strange for me for many reasons, starting from the fact that in vim having nested "vims" was a trivial thing to do
[16:21:37] <FromGitter> <henriquenj> This terminal probably only receives commands and outputs the results, it is not "interactive"
[16:21:38] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> so I guess here I should somehow run the command to output the thing to another buffer in my current spacemacs?
[16:22:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > say I am in the integrated shell itself and run something into an emacs buffer what can I do? ‚èé  ‚èé I don't understand this exactly, but I guess you might want to use `SPC f f`
[16:22:37] <FromGitter> <henriquenj> One of the reasons is that the terminal does not capture the emacs commands
[16:23:33] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Or you'd like to have the output in some buffer
[16:23:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> ?
[16:23:42] <FromGitter> <henriquenj> I see in the shell layer documentation that there are several types of shell, I think that for getting an interactive shell you should use `term` in `shell-default-shell`
[16:24:46] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> okay, but I need two things even simpler
[16:26:33] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > Or you'd like to have the output in some buffer ‚èé  ‚èé If you'd like that then use `SPC u M-:`
[16:27:20] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> a: how do I open from the current shell I have a file in another buffer? is there some command here I can run? say I I'm in that shell at `/home/foo/bar/` and there's a file `baz.md` is there a way to "instruct spacemacs" to run it in another buffer directly from the shell?
[16:28:07] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I use `SPC f f`
[16:28:10] <FromGitter> <henriquenj> By running you mean opening? (or *visiting* in emacs terminology)
[16:28:28] <FromGitter> <henriquenj> If that's the case, I do just like Daniel and use `SPC f f` with ivy
[16:29:11] <FromGitter> <henriquenj> Generally I navigate directories with Emacs and then copy the path to a separate terminal, it seems you are trying to do the other way around, is that so?
