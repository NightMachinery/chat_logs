[17:14:01] <programmerq> [twisti]▸ are those containers attached to a --attachable overlay network? If so, they could be hitting a race condition where the restart policy is attempted before before the overlay network stuff is available.

[17:46:16] <newb134> when I run the offical docker ghost, I run docker run -d --name some-ghost ghost but when I go to Ip:2368 I get an error anyone know why?
[17:46:30] <newb134> https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/
[17:53:43] <Anticom> newb134: you need to expose the port as well. Add `-p 2368:2368` to your docker run.
[17:54:30] <Anticom> Also if you just want to try out the image I recommend also adding `--rm`, otherwise if you stop the container it will remain on your system (docker ps -a). If you add `--rm` docker will automatically remove the container once its stopped
[17:58:58] <newb134> thanks
[18:08:57] <faceface> wez: thanks
[18:09:21] <newb134> Anticom when I do the command and run sudo docker ps -a, the port is specified as 0.0.0.0:3001->2368/tcp rather than the server IP?
[18:10:05] <wez> faceface: Anytime
[18:11:06] <Anticom> newb134: you shouldn't need sudo :o
[18:11:44] <Anticom> newb134: Did you also pass the `-e url=http://localhost:3001` flag?
[18:12:02] <newb134> i didnt pass that flag
[18:12:17] <Anticom> Because this is setting the env var url inside the docker container. I suppose ghost is extracting the desired port from this
[18:12:43] <newb134> sudo docker run -d --name some-ghost -p 3001:2368 -v /path/to/ghost/blog:/var/lib/ghost/content ghost:alpine
[18:13:11] <Anticom> newb134: <Anticom> newb134: you need to expose the port as well. Add `-p 2368:2368` to your docker run.
[18:13:16] <Anticom> Find the difference ;)
[18:13:51] <Anticom> newb134: man docker-run -->  "-p, --publish ip:[hostPort]:containerPort | [hostPort:]containerPort"
[18:14:13] <Anticom> You've configured your container to pass port 3001 from your host to 2368 in the container
[18:14:37] <newb134> ah that makes sense thanks
[18:15:02] <Anticom> newb134: Read more about it here: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports
[18:15:11] <newb134> will do
