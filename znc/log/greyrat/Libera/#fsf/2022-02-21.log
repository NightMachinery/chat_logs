[04:57:22] <Kolev> On this network, I recommend Jellyfin, and someone comes in and starts shooting it down and saying it's worthless, and to use Plex instead.
[04:57:38] <Kaiod> Parts such as hardware? Or parts like a software?
[04:57:46] <tpefreedom> hardware
[04:57:54] <tpefreedom> likee motherboards or cpus or ram
[04:58:17] <Kolev> I then try to be relatable to people, by admitting that I'm not perfect and use Roku for the moment, until I have money to buy a computer to run Kodi on.
[04:58:50] <Kaiod> tpefreedom: Have you checked out the stores that sell free hardware? Some are very interesting! 
[04:58:57] <Kolev> Then they just say "waaa you're not perfect, you use Roku.  Go ahead and use Plex!"

[04:59:29] <tpefreedom> I don't get what's better about plex

[05:20:55] <Kaiod> You may not be able to use free software everywhere all the time, whether for financial reasons, or for other forces beyond your control. This can happen, and it's Okay, the road to total freedom is a gradual one, and if you are full of non-free software you can get rid of it little by little by finding alternatives and even paying for ways to support it.
[05:20:55] <Kaiod> You saying no once to non-free software helps, you spreading the word helps, and it all contributes to your individual freedom.

[06:00:19] *** Quits: euphoricallysane (~quatro@user/euphoricallysane) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:01:45] <apteryx> Also, the Wikipedia page of Wakanim says "The videos are DRM protected which the playback takes place via a proprietary HTML5 player called JW-Player version 8.11.8 (as of February 2020)." (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakanim)
[06:04:53] <Announ> I donʼt know about what their Web sites use, but both seem to be supported by youtube-dl or yt-dlp.
[06:08:54] <Announ> Presumably that means that they donʼt use any DRM. And if they do, it can be avoided by using these programs.

[20:36:51] <Kolev> isf: Mumble is excellent software, but I can't move the entire Yiddish community, or even the core of it, to another platform.
[20:37:16] <isf> Yoy cant move them becouse they have individual freedom to choise
[20:37:35] <isf> You must say to them first what is free software. and them go to choice the best for them.
[20:37:58] <isf> And if you do good your work they go to move to the free software.
[20:38:06] <isf> voluntary

[20:38:32] <labrador> see Kolev its impossible and this is a tangential problem to freedom
[20:38:37] <labrador> This is vendor lockin
[20:38:46] <labrador> And bugs free software like signal too
[20:39:15] <isf> signal isnt free software
[20:39:23] <isf> or yes?
[20:39:42] <isf> i see some information of have nonfree libraries and dependence in nonfree software of google.
[20:39:56] <isf> the best communication instant message you can use is XMPP. 
[20:41:12] <labrador> isf, signal is totally free and it doesn't really depend on it....just that the fallback mechanism takes a lot of battery
[20:41:26] <labrador> isf, also nothing is the best...depends on the circumstances
[20:41:44] <isf> in terms of freedom
[20:41:51] <isf> XMPP is completly recommended 
[20:42:03] <isf> Signal have the worst dependency ever
[20:42:15] <isf> the dream stalin, the phone
[20:43:53] <labrador> uh huh sure
[20:47:03] <jacobk> Signal is not in Trisquel, Guix, or F-Droid, and it's a candidate for deletion in the FSD, due to nonfree dependencies. Also, the FSD links to a page that shows code added that loads Google's reCAPTCHA code. So, although lots of people say it's free, I've been hesitant to install it.
[20:48:07] <Kolev> I hate computers.
[20:48:14] <isf> Thanks for that extra details jacobk, happy hacking!
[20:48:17] <labrador> jacobk, it technically depends on GSM but it fallbacks
[20:48:22] <labrador> So it doesn't count

[21:07:17] <ksjksk> why chromium ?
[21:08:04] <labrador> ksjksk, why not?
[21:08:08] <gnoo> it's worse than firefox, thus higher cve numbers
[21:08:31] <labrador> gnoo, nah its security is top notch compared to firefo
[21:08:32] <labrador> x
[21:08:54] <gnoo> ok,,, at this point i don't really wanna argue any more
[21:09:13] <ksjksk> chromium is controlled by google
[21:09:33] <labrador> gnoo, mozilla's engine does a lot of things better but security isn't one
[21:09:36] <gnoo> idk why you think it's secure but i'd advise to get out of that propaganda soon
[21:09:46] <labrador> ksjksk, does that have anything to with security?
[21:10:09] <GNUHacker> chromium is the google lie
[21:10:16] <gnoo> can you show us why you think it is "secure" ?
[21:10:20] *** Quits: nrg (~NRG@user/nrg) (Client Quit)
[21:10:43] <gnoo> i've shown you why i think _all_ browsers are inherently insecure and how chromium is the worst
[21:10:59] <ksjksk> it has lot of ti think chromium also has telemetry
[21:11:01] <gnoo> s/_all_/_all_ modern/
[21:11:10] <labrador> https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
[21:11:18] <labrador> This is the best source you can get
[21:11:29] <labrador> GrapheneOS's entire focus is security
[21:11:44] <gnoo> after reading the last blog by grapheneos, i no longer consider their dev's opinion as good
[21:11:58] <labrador> gnoo, sure sure
[21:12:03] <GNUHacker> many fools trust in chromium because "is free"
[21:13:49] <labrador> Firefox / Gecko also bypass or cripple a fair bit of the upstream and GrapheneOS hardening work for apps. Worst of all, Firefox runs as a single process on mobile and has no sandbox beyond the OS sandbox.
[21:14:01] <labrador> FF sucks in the sandboxing department
[21:14:16] <ksjksk> I think chromium is like android which is free but controlled by google.
[21:14:42] <gnoo> >Chromium itself aims to prevent tracking through mechanisms other than cookies, greatly narrowing the scope downstream work needs to cover.
[21:15:05] <gnoo> if you believe chromium, developed by google, will track less, then ....
[21:15:58] <labrador> hey see man do you think this website I linked to is google's? Why do you think the GrapheneOS's devs don't know what they're doing?
[21:16:32] *** Joins: nrg (~NRG@user/nrg)
[21:16:44] <gnoo> the grapheneos devs clearly like google very much
[21:17:03] <labrador> lmao ok
[21:17:09] <labrador> They just like security
[21:17:10] <gnoo> can only work on pixel, recommends play store over f-droid, says how tor is bad but chromium is not...
[21:17:31] <gnoo> 3>Tor Browser but there are many ways to bypass the anti-fingerprinting and state partitioning. The Tor Browser's security is weak which makes the privacy protection weak.
[21:17:49] <gnoo> sure, a claim without anything to back it up
[21:18:15] <labrador> Tor is based on firefox
[21:18:18] <labrador> FF sucks in the sandboxing department
[21:18:25] <labrador> simple conclusion
[21:19:43] <gnoo> sure, it's not like the tor people have had any history of knowing what they do -- oh wait!
