[02:07:03] <memelover> I see some programs on the AUR targeting OpenRC or runit as an init system. Out of curiosity, what's arch's feeling towards "alternative" init systems on the AUR? I understand that systemd is the only supported one in the official repos, but I was surprised to see programs targeting other init systems in the AUR. Is the AUR for _anything_, or should the programs _always_ work with arch(+systemd)?
[02:07:56] <thurstylark> aur packages also aren't supported
[02:08:00] <thurstylark> so... like that :P
[02:08:29] <Khorne> They should still be usable on Arch
[02:08:47] <memelover> Right - so I'd say that OpenRC packages aren't usable on Arch whatsoever

[02:20:52] <memelover> thurstylark: I understand (and it's a good idea to not kick it), but I was interested in the "official" opinion. Out of curiosity though, does this extend to, say, hosting a program that for whatever reason is only compatible with debian releases? I'm just curious about what the purpose of the AUR is, in actuality.
[02:20:52] <kevr> there should be guidelines, but i don't think it should be up to anyone to censor a properly made package that doesn't coinside with official installs
[02:21:52] <arseru> Does anybody know a good package for CardDAV management from ArchLinux? I'm looking for the "merging contacts" functionality found in Google Contacts, but directly from a contacts.vcf file
[02:22:09] <kevr> the purpose of the AUR is to allow users to upload their own packages, regardless of any incompatibility or licensing that is required. It is a crowd-sourced package repository.

[02:23:35] <memelover> got it, thanks!
[02:23:42] <demonicmaniac1> as aur is package building instructions and not packaging/distribution - yes
[02:23:47] <demonicmaniac1> that's the important difference
[02:24:04] <kevr> there are also -bin packages which purely distribute within the aur
[02:24:14] <demonicmaniac1> they don't though
[02:24:32] <demonicmaniac1> they are not hosted by archlinux as a binary package. they are instructions to download a -bin from somewhere else
[02:24:47] <kevr> fair enough
[02:24:54] <demonicmaniac1> most bin packages point to an official rpm or deb package that gets extracted and converted into an arch package locally on your machine

[06:28:16] <jonathon> aurutils
[06:28:17] <mpan> The crowd often shouts “aurutils” if someone asks about an AUR tool. Note that I am only reporting what the crowd says, as I myself use no AUR helper.

[06:29:03] <jonathon> aurutils essentially wraps makechrootpkg and repo-add, it works well
[06:29:13] <mpan> aurutils is a set of tools to incorporate into your own AUR workflow. Which is well fitting into the general advice on how AUR should be used. Automatizes what should be automatized, and that’s it.

[14:42:58] <tylee> very noobish question: how potential hacker can steal gpg key (or any other file) from my pc? one option is some malware which will 3curl -T ~/.gpg. Another option is unprotected ssh/sftp ports, which hadn't been closed with firewall & router. But maybe some other options exist? Like hijacking CUPS i don't know. In other words how to properly protect my data and 1take off tinfoil hat
[14:43:55] <grawity> there *is* some, which is why things like AppArmor exist (apparmor rules can be written for services, restricting them to only paths they need), and why systemd has options like ProtectHome=

[21:42:31] <brian_> Hi! I just installed Arch for the first time yesterday (coming from Ubuntu/Debian), and I'm having a little trouble getting connected to ethernet. It automagically connects using the live system, but once I reboot, it refuses to connect. I tried some noodling around (installed dhcpd and netctl), but my network interface still stays down even with an `ip link set enp2s0 up`
[21:43:02] <brian_> Hoping someone can point me in the right direction to learn a little more, since I'd rather understand what I'm doing than just install random packages and guess around at what's going on.

[22:06:53] <brian_> So, just to make sure I'm understanding what I'm reading correctly -- netctl, NetworkManager, and systemd-networkd all do *roughly* the same thing? Detect, manage, and configure network connections?
[22:07:04] <thurstylark> brian_: yup

[22:07:28] <thurstylark> !best

[22:08:01] <brian_> I like that :) I was initially understanding that they handled different aspects of networking, and that seemed rather convoluted
[22:08:20] <Warepire> hello-smile48: Partial updates
[22:08:30] <thurstylark> nah, there are several things like that in the repos.
[22:08:39] <thurstylark> many tools that do the same job in a different way
[22:09:04] <MrElendig> brian_: stay away from netctl though
[22:09:15] <thurstylark> yes, there are also bad tools :P
[22:09:20] <brian_> I like networkd, from what I can see, but I've got some more learning to do before I can form a real opinion -- either way, my network interface is up now that I remembered to start the systemd service
[22:09:32] <thurstylark> \o/
[22:10:13] <brian_> lol, I'll make sure to uninstall it -- I appreciate the freedom to install whatever packages I want, but I'll happily take recommendations on which ones to avoid :)

[23:23:30] <agvantibo> Hello. I'm trying to get my initramfs to fsck the root at boot. I've followed the wiki instructions, but to no avail. Surprisingly, the fallback initramfs does check the root, but this is not an optimal solution... Anybody got that to work?

[23:31:51] <baltazar> ok this is pretty weird
[23:32:05] <baltazar> the pulseaudio monitor leakage only seems to happen if I have both mpv and chromium running
[23:32:48] <baltazar> ah, no, now mpv seems to be sufficient
