[07:10:59] <Ungwelian> It's not a hoax and the Nazis did terrible things. However, it shouldn't be forgotten that their opponents did terrible things too.
[07:11:23] <Ungwelian> For example, the bombing of Dresden was pretty much a crime against humanity.
[07:16:59] <Ungwelian> https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/22/worlddispatch.germany
[07:16:59] <ro-bot-o> [url] Germany's forgotten victims | World news | The Guardian | www.theguardian.com
[07:17:44] <Ungwelian> "The charred, mutilated bodies of women, children and babies are all civilians who perished during the allies' bombing campaign against Germany's cities.
[07:17:46] <Ungwelian> Around 600,000 German civilians died during the allies' wartime raids on Germany, including 76,000 German children, Friedrich says. In July 1943, during a single night in Hamburg, 45,000 people perished in a vast firestorm."
[07:19:37] <Ungwelian> The British even bombed the Berlin zoo.

[22:44:29] <biys> causative: yah i've read that a couple times.
[22:44:46] <biys> i still don't think it's about suicide though
[22:45:07] <biys> i'd say it's more-so associated with the fact that everything Hamlet.jr seems to know is falling apart around him
[22:45:16] <biys> he has ideas about the world and the most accurate way to live within it
[22:45:20] <biys> he's questioning everything he knows
[22:46:08] <biys> we aren't sure the effect that Claudius murder of Hamlet sr. has entirely.  it is eluded to that Hamlet.sr might not have been an admirable fellow
[22:47:05] <biys> so it isn't so much a suicide soliliquay as much as it is a internal death
[22:47:21] <biys> a death of his sense of self as he sees the world that has been built up around him fall to pieces
[22:47:34] <biys> the value structures he had and the ideas about how to operate within the world
[22:48:13] <biys> where does one go after such a death?
[22:48:26] <biys> it means you'd have to re-build your understanding of the world
[22:48:30] <biys> you'd have to question everything you think you know
[22:48:44] <biys> as it would have been built on an understanding of the world that is now gone
[22:48:57] <biys> :s/of the world/of a world/
[22:49:36] <biys> Claudius even seems to be aware of the fact that his Marriage to his brothers wife definitely looks problematic
[22:49:47] <biys> yet his ambassadors are the ones who told him to do it
[22:49:55] <biys> hamlet is privy to this conversation
[22:50:20] <biys> where as it would've been extremely prooblematic prior...  incestuous
[22:51:43] <I_Am_M00t> my man biys generating content
[22:51:58] <biys> ophelia after h amlet exists even says that hamlet is gone
[22:52:05] <biys> gone in the sense that he is no longer the same person he was
[22:52:09] <biys> somethign has changed him
[22:52:30] <biys> his view of the world, his perceptions and his understanding of how everythign around him works has been broken
[22:52:35] <biys> he has to build anew
[22:52:47] <biys> I_Am_M00t: you still rage typing at Leeloo?
[22:52:58] <biys> i swear you guys all love her
[22:53:08] <biys> i am jealous that she takes up as much space in your guys minds as she does

[22:55:29] <biys> so anyways
[22:55:53] <biys> back in the ray prior to Russia JBP and Sam Harris had a conversation essentially, as far as i'm concerned anyways, about the idea of biological determinism vs. free will
[22:56:03] <biys> :s/ray/day/
[22:56:32] <biys> and Harris asked Peterson what a person void of judeo christian indoctrination would look like
[22:56:37] <biys> a true "atheist" in every sense of the world

[22:57:05] <biys> and Peterson ends up saying something like Rodion Raskolnikov

[22:57:51] <mannequin> je ne parles vu frances
[22:58:21] <causative> "for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause"
[22:58:44] <causative> this is about actual death, not a metaphorical shattering of illusions
[22:58:46] <biys> For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
[22:58:46] <biys> When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
[22:58:46] <biys> Must give us pause. There's the respect
[22:58:47] <biys> That makes calamity of so long life.
[22:58:59] <biys> you can't quote it the way you are
[22:59:22] <causative> the "dreams" that may come, he's talking about heaven or hell
[22:59:31] <causative> and he's saying the afterlife must give us pause
[22:59:49] <causative> and he's also talking about "shuffling off this mortal coil," this is not a mere metaphor for a change in thinking
[22:59:52] <biys> it's a contrast and comparison to his first questions
[22:59:57] <biys> which is a matter of nobility
[23:00:12] *** Joins: aleph0 (~aleph0@gateway/tor-sasl/aleph0)
[23:00:27] <biys> he's ssentially asking the question of how a person _ought_ to act
[23:00:41] <biys> tis nobler in the mind to suffer?
[23:00:44] <biys> or to take up arms?
[23:00:52] <biys> to die? sleep?
[23:01:07] <causative> yeah he's asking if it's nobler to suffer or kill yourself
[23:01:08] <biys> if we die, suer we might not feel anything...
[23:01:19] *** Quits: Jad (~Nashmi@user/jad) (Quit: Benefits I derive from free­dom are largely the result of the uses of freedom by others, and mostly of those uses of freedom that I could never avail myself of.)
[23:01:20] <biys> we'll be void of experiences
[23:01:32] <biys> what makes a person willing to suffer?
[23:01:37] <biys> "suffer" ?
[23:01:43] <biys> the opressors wrong
[23:01:46] <biys> the proud mans insults
[23:01:52] <biys> the pangs of dispriszed love
[23:01:53] <biys> laws delay
[23:03:02] <causative> well, Hamlet says we suffer through life because we fear Hell
[23:03:26] <causative> "But that the dread of something after death, the undiscovered country, etc"
[23:04:11] <biys> oh definitely
[23:04:21] <biys> a reason people might go through the suffering is associated with their religion
[23:04:38] <biys> i think christians believe that the harsher their struggles in life the moer challenges god provides them
[23:04:45] <biys> the better of it makes them as people
[23:04:58] <biys> not to mention that killing yoruself, as a christian, would result in hell
[23:05:35] <biys> we have to keep in mind that this is kind of all that hamlet knows too
[23:05:46] <biys> it's a matter of his intersectionality and his indocintration
[23:05:49] <biys> indoctrination
[23:06:01] <biys> but the ideas of catholicism are pretty thick
[23:06:09] <biys> even the idea of hamlet.sr in purgatory
[23:06:22] <biys> and hamlet jr even with teh perfect chance doesn't kill polonius
[23:06:25] <biys> cause he's praying
[23:06:47] <biys> and during his prayers he could be asking god forgiveness
[23:07:01] <biys> which will mean he goes straight to heaven instead of having to wander the kingdom as hamlet sr does
[23:07:48] <causative> So, Hamlet is upset about his life and is thinking of killing himself, but fears the afterlife
[23:08:07] <causative> this is the declarative content of the soliloquoy
[23:09:01] <causative> everything is is style and pomp
[23:09:07] <causative> *everything else is style and pomp
[23:17:13] <causative> in philosophy, we ought to strip away style and pomp, strip away the weight of historical authority and social custom, and look only at what plain, declarative propositions are actually asserted, and how well-founded those may be
[23:18:11] <causative> substance over style.  We should have an attitude of skepticism about substance: if we can't clearly identify the substantial, declarative claims in a text, we should be skeptical that the substance is there at all.
[23:19:16] <mannequin> you don't discuss with God
[23:19:22] <mannequin> you listen to him
[23:19:46] <causative> people have come up with thousands of gods
