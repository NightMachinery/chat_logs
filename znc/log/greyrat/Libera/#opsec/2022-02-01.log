[06:19:10] <Joanna> Why does there have to be day prison at all to brainwash children into stupid adults? Who benefits?
[06:20:01] <jan6> we went over it already, it's not mandated, only doing the tests is, homeschooling is a possibility in most places
[06:20:18] <jan6> not only me, but someone else, also said that
[06:20:29] <Joanna> It wasn’t so bad back when children had mothers and siblings at home to interact with maybe.

[18:46:33] <Joanna> JimBuntu: not much besides choking on air pollution and wondering why nobody else wants to do anything about it.
[18:55:55] <JimBuntu> Usual reason, boils down to money, that's my bet.
[19:19:54] <Joanna> It’s like nobody notices the obvious. Do other people enjoy choking on smog?

[19:27:43] <JimBuntu> Getting away from mass amounts of people and the results of that are why I don't live in a large city any more.  When we go places for vacation or to the airport, we can definitely smell the difference. The kids joke about how the cities stink.
[19:33:10] <Joanna> It’s not the people , it’s the cars. And I think incinerators or something burning plastic.
[19:34:31] <JimBuntu> the cars and such are 'the results' of the mass amount of people I was talking about
[19:34:34] <Joanna> Why is it ok for people to poison the Air I need to breathe?
[19:35:00] <Joanna> They could use trains or bikes or walk in most cases

[19:35:35] <Joanna> They are encouraged to be selfish and inconsiderate
[19:35:39] <JimBuntu> 'in most cases'... only if there are many other changes.  Most places around here don't even have trains... so you are talking more about buses, which still isn't nearly enough
[19:36:45] <JimBuntu> It requires a substantial change in general life.  If someone goes out to work somewhere X hours a day, they would need to live within reasonable distance to that place... even with massive public transport... more time traveling will pretty much always use more energy
[19:37:29] <Joanna> Even one car or motorcycle passing by lets out a lot of noxious gas I don’t think they have smog controls here not that I consider that a solution to problem.
[19:38:13] <JimBuntu> I don't think you will convince many people to pedal bike or walk 15+ miles each direction to work.
[19:38:18] <Joanna> It’s all set up to be toxic.
[19:38:36] <JimBuntu> It's set up to be convenient, toxic is the byproduct
[19:39:26] <Joanna> The only thing I can say about suburbia is tear it all down and rebuild it properly. The sooner the better.
[19:40:03] <JimBuntu> That sounds pretty drastic and authoritarian
[19:40:16] <Joanna> It’s not convenient nor does it give freedom.
[19:40:34] <SANCLA> Yeah, letś just blow it all up and start over...
[19:41:07] <SANCLA> Problem is, such fundamental changes takes a lot time
[19:41:22] <SANCLA> The world we live in, is like one big giant system
[19:41:23] <Joanna> Neighborhoods were destroyed by building the freeways to begin with .
[19:41:25] <SANCLA> With a lot of bugs
[19:41:43] <Joanna> It’s like a badly fragmented disk
[19:41:48] <SANCLA> lol
[19:42:08] <Joanna> Eminent domain is authoritarian.
[19:43:56] <Joanna> It’s really not that hard to do a road diet to discourage driving. If people want to drive let their speed be slower that streetcars and bicycles.
[19:44:27] <SANCLA> Well, if you need to do it more then once, you should automate it
[19:45:36] <JimBuntu> Ok, let's play the scenario... we are tearing down where you live Joanna, plus 100 miles in all directions. Your domicile is now property of the State along with your posessions. You are now a worker for the State, but don't worry... the first thing we will have you help build is temp housing and we will give you the required nutrition. You will not be paid though, at the end of this we will allow you to start
[19:45:38] <JimBuntu> making payments in the form of rent for the domicile you will help build.  To be efficient, they are all apartment buildings.  Sound good?
[19:46:36] <SANCLA> The next phase is learning Russian btw
[19:46:47] <Joanna> There really shouldn’t be private passenger cars on the road. I can understand cement trucks and the like not being able to use public transportation.
[19:48:08] <Joanna> I don’t want to tear down where I live I just want to exclude cars and plant more trees so I can breathe.
[19:48:26] <SANCLA> How do you get the trees to your house?
[19:48:41] <Joanna> Seeds
[19:48:52] <SANCLA> How do you get the seeds to your house?
[19:48:59] <SANCLA> :-)
[19:48:59] <JimBuntu> Is someone stopping you from planting trees on your property?
[19:49:32] <Joanna> I’ve planted trees before and people like to destroy them.
[19:49:57] <Joanna> And no I don’t have anywhere to plant trees here
[19:50:51] <JimBuntu> There are many efforts currently ongoing to increase tree count.  You could help/support one of those.  Maybe even start a new one.  Since it's not REALLY about trees though and about biological plant filters, maybe we should look for which ones are better than others and focus on those.
[19:51:08] <Joanna> Apartments aren’t the only type of compact housing.what about townhouses with yards?
[19:51:23] <JimBuntu> Nope. Not good 'enough'
[19:52:20] <JimBuntu> We are rebuilding 'properly' not just 'better'.  Don't worry though, the next phase will be to relocate everyone to underground dwellings so we can free up surface space.  But that's part of a different phase.
[19:52:35] <Joanna> It’s not enough to plant trees it’s also necessary to not kill them. The last place I lived was planting and killing trees nonstop.
[19:53:46] <Joanna> Your idea of proper is not the same as mine . Earth shelter homes are sometimes good as they have in china.
[19:54:45] <JimBuntu> That's one of the root issues... defining what 'proper' is.  That's the issue right now.
[19:55:06] <Joanna> There is no shortage of surface space it’s just poorly used for pavement for car owners who are too lazy to walk.
[19:55:17] <JimBuntu> And I have nothing against underground dwelling, but in my scenario it's more of underground apartment buildings
[19:55:43] <Joanna> It would be too dark without wasting electricity
[19:56:16] <Joanna> Unless it was dug into side of a hill
[19:56:20] <JimBuntu> The increased surface space provides more area for solar panels and such.  Plenty of space that can't currently be used for agriculture to now be used for solar electricity production.

[19:59:32] <JimBuntu> You live thanks to chemically produced electricity.
[19:59:47] <Joanna> Artificial lights are unhealthy
[19:59:52] <JimBuntu> bs
[20:00:18] <Joanna> I’ve seen dead grass under artificial lights
[20:00:22] <JimBuntu> *some* forms of artificial lighting are unhealthy... but that's a property of the light they produce and how they produce it
[20:00:43] <JimBuntu> light is light, it doesn't carry disease because it came from one source versus another
[20:00:54] <Joanna> Some is worse than others
[20:01:20] <JimBuntu> some light, not because of where it came from. However, there are other issues with how some light is produced such as EMI
[20:01:25] <JimBuntu> ^^ for an example
[20:02:12] <Joanna> Artificial light messes up your biological functions.
[20:02:35] <JimBuntu> I have grow lights... not healthy for me to spend too long exposed to them, but they are purpose built for my plants and not humans.  Another example.  Meanwhile, some lights (the item that emits the light) are designed for human use and aren't very helpful to plants
[20:02:38] <Joanna> Anything brighter than a candle
[20:03:09] <Joanna> Why grow lights? Why not use the sun?
[20:03:56] <Joanna> I think of illegal pot farm when I hear that term..
[20:04:01] <JimBuntu> If I relied on light from the Sun here, I wouldn't be able to grow as much or as well and it would be much more dependant on Sun variables such as how many fruiting seasons per year/etc
[20:04:31] <JimBuntu> Thinking of an illegal anything is not my problem, it's also not the case. I'm not growing anything illegal.  
[20:05:06] <Joanna> Well the furthest I would go is a greenhouse..
[20:06:10] <JimBuntu> Well, that's you and leads back to individual definitions for 'proper'... meanwhile, growing indoors allows for more control and the ability to do things otherwise very difficult and possibly nearly impossible outside... in some areas, such as large aquaponics farms
[20:06:15] <Joanna> Using energy from a power plant to grow food is not sustainable.
[20:06:58] <JimBuntu> Use the Sun as the power plant, but don't rely on it's changing output directly. Store the energy and use it how you need instead.
[20:07:18] <Joanna> Maybe you need more acres to grow food in the sun

[20:08:13] <Joanna> I’m frustrated because I can’t farm
[20:08:43] <JimBuntu> At the end of the day though, pretty much none of this is sustainable unless the output requirements are small enough to allow enough time for the 'waste' to be converted back to 'inputs' for the system.

[20:10:58] <JimBuntu> The water cycle is a simple example of this... not enough water in some area, so they pull it from the ground... but that water can take many, many years to get back into that underground source. There can be a time where you empty the water from the source and use it, and now it's all traveling back down to that source place.  It's all natural, but it's not built for people to use, it's nature.  If you do it
[20:11:01] <JimBuntu> with more control, such as an indoor hydro area, you can also handle the treatment of the water and only have to ever use X amount of it in a much smaller water cycle.
[20:13:40] <JimBuntu> I don't think hydro or even aquaponics is the ultimate solution though.  Need something of a more controlled permaculture system, but still closed and controlled.  Need to keep soil and all of the bacteria and other life in the soil as part of the system, imho, because there is synergy in that.
[20:17:06] <JimBuntu> Worms for example, they aren't just worms... they are little biological machines, in a sense.
