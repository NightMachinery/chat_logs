[00:28:37] <tirnanog> variables don't expand in single quotes. this is a matter that concerns the shell, not sed.
[00:30:01] <tirnanog> they will do so within double quotes. however, you should then exercise caution because it can become a means of code injection. if the string you are injecting is under your control (not user input) and known to be safe in that context, then go for it.

[01:06:49] <geirha> And since you're using GNU-specific sed syntax, variables you inject may also lead to arbirtrary code exedcution, so don't inject data provided by a user
