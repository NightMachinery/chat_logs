[18:41:58] <manicennui> 2010 would be an improvement. I think most people I encounter formed their opinions about Java in the late 90s.
[18:42:07] <manicennui> When they wrote some applet.
[18:42:39] <manicennui> The design pattern overload is a pretty common complaint too though.
[18:42:45] <manicennui> Also has nothing to do with the language.
[18:47:18] <lunik1> I think having too many design patterns is somewhat a failure of a language

[18:51:10] <sobel> manicennui: yeah, 2010 is generous of me. the stability/quality perception seems rooted in 2003 and the ecosystem perception seems to be rooted somewhere 2005ish. right about when i was starting to question OOP and reach for Spring.
[18:51:52] <sobel> lunik1: design patterns emerge where the langue is a problem
[18:51:55] <sobel> language
[18:52:20] <sobel> java has to have visitor patterns because you can't implement a generic visitor
[18:53:17] <sobel> that's what happens when you let users create types willy-nilly. feh, users!
[18:54:44] <manicennui> The thing is, a large number of people used design patterns in Java not because they needed them, but because they learned about them and thought they should use them.
[18:54:54] <manicennui> And then coupled that with extremely bad naming.
[18:55:06] <lunik1> you can have good patterns too, though
[18:55:09] <sobel> that's a community problem they need to recognize/own/destroy
[18:55:22] <sobel> i like java's conventional programming patterns
[18:55:37] <manicennui> I feel like the average Java programmer isn't involved in the community at all.
[18:55:38] <lunik1> manicennui: were they needed at the time and have since been made obsolete?
[18:56:00] <sobel> manicennui: VERY true, so the community is really the big library builders, i suppose
[18:56:14] <manicennui> lunik1: The book was written before Java existed.
[18:56:42] <manicennui> lunik1: I'd say that some of the patterns are certainly useful, and might point to problems in the language, but many people just used patterns without any real understanding of why.
[18:56:57] *** Joins: zmt00 (~zmt00@user/zmt00)
[18:57:09] <lunik1> I can see that
[18:57:33] <manicennui> And instead of reading about the pattern and understanding it and using something bits of that knowledge to write better code, people would implement the pattern exactly as described whether it made sense or not.
[18:58:12] *** Quits: googol (~matthew@192.81.130.185) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:58:19] <manicennui> I've certainly written code in Ruby that is very similar to some design pattern.
[18:58:36] <manicennui> But I didn't refer to the book or whatever to write it "correctly".
[18:59:50] <manicennui> Things like the adapter pattern are used all over, including almost certainly in clojure code.
[19:00:05] <sobel> Java/Java developers are sometimes a perfect storm of unhealthy ecosystem and imposter's syndrome
[19:00:16] <manicennui> But most people don't feel the need to implement it exactly as described.
[19:00:32] <manicennui> If they are even aware of it.
[19:01:16] <sobel> after i got a handle on clojure, i never looked back at design patterns again. except maybe sadly. :)
[19:02:13] <sobel> for me coding is hard enough that i hate the idea of building something that ends up locked into some cargo cult of types from a library outside of my purview
[19:02:27] <manicennui> Sure, but I'm guessing you can see how things like the adapter pattern and the strategy pattern are pretty general and it wouldn't be surprising if you implemented something like them in Clojure.
[19:02:35] <sobel> absolutely, and i do
[19:02:48] <manicennui> You just don't feel the need to refer back to the book or whatever and do it "right".
[19:03:50] <sobel> i have the tools to do exactly what i need, without the usual constraints of languages that won't let me pass any arithmetic operators as functions or map over members of a structuer
[19:04:08] <manicennui> I think the biggest problem is that people don't see design patterns for what they were: some experienced engineers pointing out common patterns they saw in software solutions. Not some kind of templates for how things must be done.
[19:04:32] <sobel> in other words, i don't need any canned patterns design for a particular class or collection of particular class
[19:04:42] <sobel> which is where Java kept making me sad
[19:05:24] <sobel> yeah, and i have a lot of respect for early Spring for providing patterns via abstract classes that were *really* useful to me at the time. i knew the useful patterns when i saw them.
[19:06:21] <sobel> i loved their sql usage patterns. a command pattern for the important ops.
[19:28:54] <technomancy> manicennui: I agree but I think the way the book was written makes it hard to blame people
[19:30:19] <manicennui> I admit that I have never read the original book and have only read about second or third-hand descriptions of the patterns.

[20:17:32] <technomancy> does anyone think that quoting is easier to learn in Clojure because lists aren't typically used for data? or does that make it more confusing?

[20:30:01] <sobel> i prefer examples with vectors tbh
[20:30:51] <sobel> which at first was confusing because i had to stare at it hard and think about whether i'm looking at a binding form or a vector. that got easier for me.
[20:40:17] <technomancy> the separation between lists and vectors makes it easier to understand how to do regular coding, but does it make it easier to understand quoting specifically or does it just mean you can get along without understanding quoting for longer?

[20:45:20] <ridcully> i'd guess the later?  out of my head i have a hard time thinking of places where you have to know about quoting.  the things that come to my mind is using require in the repl and datomic-ish queries

[20:48:10] <technomancy> haha yeah require in the repl always trips up people
[20:48:14] <technomancy> honestly I was just thinking of macros
[20:48:41] <jeaye> One of the things I struggled a lot with when starting Clojure is shaping data. I thought, since Clojure is lispy, that I should be using lists and vectors for everything. Ended up with a ton of code like (-> thing first second first) instead of (-> thing :person :address :street)
[20:48:49] <ridcully> in my mind, macros are maybe not something people have first contact with?  but that might just be my persective
[20:48:50] <technomancy> with require I think at first people just think "it has a single-tick here for some reason but don't worry about why" because you can get a really long way without really understanding symbols
[20:49:16] <jeaye> Took a while to realize that the majority of the data I wanted in Clojure was a map, with vectors only as needed.
[20:49:17] <ridcully> for your "regular stuff" you copy from the README.md you rarely have to deal with symbols
[20:51:42] <Para> I write macros so rarely I always have to look up the syntax anyway vOv
[20:51:57] <jeaye> technomancy: ` is a bit magical for someone who is just thinking of code as data, since it's doing a lot for you beyond the data you're writing.
[20:52:08] <jeaye> That's what threw me off.
[20:52:39] <jeaye> If I had to use ' and fully qualify everything, it'd make more sense, coming from C macros and the like.
[20:53:04] <technomancy> jeaye: it makes a lot more sense once you understand the problem it's solving (symbol capture)
[20:53:22] <ridcully> also once you are off into macro-land you also have two quotes and the slicing to understand.  at that point i'd guess you already understand what is going on
[20:53:38] <jeaye> technomancy: Yeah.
[21:01:34] <lunik1> I just very rarely use quoting and look it up when I need it...

[22:48:55] <patrice> hello all, anyone has an example handy of using a AsynchronousServerSocketChannel with futures (for accept etc)?
[22:49:48] <patrice> I tried googling and github, I can't find a complete and working example
[22:59:49] <Para> Might be most people in general don't do direct socket programming.
[23:04:26] <patrice> yes most likely
[23:07:54] <ToxicFrog> I do, but I've never used an AsynchronousServerSocketChannel for it
[23:08:57] <ToxicFrog> (two of my current projects involve socket wrangling but it's sufficient to just create a ServerSocket and loop/recur over it accepting clients and handing them off to handler threads)
[23:12:44] <patrice> yes, I have it working with handlers but I wanted to try with futures to make the code cleaner
[23:13:00] <patrice> (kinda)
[23:14:00] <ToxicFrog> The handlers use futures (and agents), I just don't use them for the accept loop :P
[23:14:29] <Para> I'd probably use aleph/manifold instead of raw socket stuff.
[23:14:57] <patrice> is the code publicly available?
[23:26:37] <patrice> Para: aleph is not really maintained anymore and so complex, it's not a good combination usually
