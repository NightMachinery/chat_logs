[01:01:36] <Gurkenglas> zebrask, i vaguely remember that when i fly it's usually levitating forward and slightly up, i project that this is common and the source of psi myths, and you'd think people sometimes dream of flight working like with Minecraft's elytra.

[01:03:20] <pompolic> when i dreamed of flight it was pretty much like floating in water
[01:03:23] <zebrask> Once I wore a haptic compass for a few weeks and my dreams had a North sense, but the dream I recall having was that I was lying down in a way that north was normal to the sensor plane, but I could still tell which direction was north, which was notable.
[01:03:25] <pompolic> suddenly, buoyancy
[01:03:28] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[01:04:16] <zebrask> In my flight dreams it felt more like flying in a video game or something from what I recall. I'm just moving around in 3 dimensions, no proprioception or acceleration senses.
[01:04:41] <zebrask> Though I haven't had one in a while, so it could be those were erased as part of memory consolidation and were present during the original dream.
[01:04:53] <Gurkenglas> zebrask, when you took the compass off did you keep the north sense?
[01:05:15] <zebrask> Gurkenglas: In real life or in the dream?
[01:05:19] <Gurkenglas> in real life.
[01:05:39] <Gurkenglas> it'd of course be faked by the brain, but it's good at faking stuff and it can be useful.
[01:06:10] <zebrask> No, other than it reorienting my internal map of a few places that were well-traveled.
[01:06:45] <zebrask> Like for example my desk was I think parallel to the front of my house, but previously I had thought of it as orthogonal.
[01:07:11] <Gurkenglas> i can imagine what a north sense'd feel like. if you had tried to anticipate what it'd feel like would you have been right?
[01:08:21] <zebrask> Yes and no. I think the actual immediate experience of sensing North is basically what you'd expect. The effect on how it orients me in space was more of a surprise, though.
[01:09:15] <Gurkenglas> like when you keep track of somebody watching you, and they're always directly north?
[01:10:08] <zebrask> Another thing is that the way it was implemented was with a magnetometer, which means that it was actually a "what is the direction of the magnetic field in this location, adjusted for where I am on the earth so that it should be North", but this meant that I noticed things like if I was walking past a pillar containing a lot of ferromagnetic metal, my North sense would suddenly swing and point to it.
[01:10:43] <zebrask> And there was something up with the highways, I think the rebar was magnetized in random directions, so when I drove home my North sense would be glitching out like crazy until I got onto side streets.
[01:11:05] <zebrask> Gurkenglas: Not sure I follow the question about keeping track of someone watching me.
[01:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> > operator is overwrite, not append, right
[01:12:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> in shell
[01:12:09] <Gurkenglas> uh. like when you pick out an object on your desk and close your eyes and turn and move your head around and you still know where it is, and the thing that you're always keeping track of is situated infinitely far to the north?
[01:12:12] <pompolic> yes, at least in bash
[01:12:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> k thx
[01:12:37] <pompolic> it's actually slightly worse: file gets truncated even if there is no output

[01:12:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[01:13:16] <gwern> yes, and append is >>. always use >>.
[01:13:29] <gwern> even if you want to overwrite, maybe just write to a temp file and explicitly mv
[01:13:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... interesting, why?
[01:13:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess for atomicity
[01:14:20] <zebrask> Yeah, I guess you could say that that's the subjective experience, of subtly paying attention to a specific direction.
[01:14:25] <kuudes> it seems I usually know where north is
[01:14:26] <gwern> yes, and debuggability. it also shields you from problems like what pompolic describes
[01:14:30] <kuudes> or well, south
[01:15:51] <zebrask> The other thing that happens is that your maps of places may get pinned so that they are oriented absolutely rather than relative to some features inside (or at least you'll feel the relative orientations of two places that otherwise would not have been "comparable" in that sense in your head).
[01:16:21] <kuudes> my friend was spooked, when I could tell him he was facing south when I videocalled him to his new house; I had been to one of his neighbours before and they shared same orientation of rooms, only mirrored

[01:21:01] <pompolic> (sorry if that's mean, i am not being serious)
[01:21:37] <Gurkenglas> zebrask, might the skill be constructed more quickly if the compass only pings at random times, so you brain has the opportunity to guess and be wrong?
[01:22:05] <kuudes> I remember I got confused when I was taken with an ambulance to hospital once, because the turns were quite fast and I was lying down head first
[01:22:07] <zebrask> I dunno, I wasn't looking to develop a skill, I was happy to wear the thing all the time.
[01:22:21] <Gurkenglas> in particular i imagine that might make the felt sense three-dimensional.
[01:23:17] <zebrask> I imagine if you wanted to develop it as an actual skill there are better ways than building a device.
[01:23:51] <zebrask> Though the device will definitely quickly orient you in all of your usual hang-outs

[11:54:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Look at what they tested! "contrast, text alignment, precision of link description, appropriateness of headings, focus visibility, number of section headings, and consistency in link style" "precision of form description, focus order, and error identification"
[11:55:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And then they specifically say "A further reason for choosing these criteria was that most of the criteria were of general relevance because it has been shown that they also provide benefits to other user groups, such as older users" ... well gee whiz, why in the world did these improvements improve things for non-disabled people, eh
[11:57:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The question we actually care about it "does conforming to the sorts of accessibility guidelines that are like 'make screen readers and other weird shit work with your site by manipulating exotic aria attributes' make things better for the general public or anyone other than users of those very specific things" - but of course we already know the answer to that one is "no" -_-
[11:58:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I don't even doubt that people are citing this study, and others like it, when it comes time to browbeat innocent web devs into fucking around with all that aria nonsense

[13:20:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because I do not get why this is needed
[13:21:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe there's a reason why Apple didn't bother having their own WebKit engineers implement this

[14:52:52] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: sure, but could you also tell me why we should fuck this guy? I'm unsure what policy recommendations you are implying are correct here.
[14:52:53] <nshepperd2> caring about solutions being 'practical community-identified health solutions' is a luxury you have if you don't actually care about the problem
[14:53:03] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I see
[14:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Why faster? Just the opposite, I should think?
[14:55:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: The way it works is that the server first sends response headers, then the client can either continue on to request the response body, or not
[14:57:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: That's what Robomot does when you post a link to a video or a zip file, for instance: it receives the headers, checks the content type, sees that it's a video (or otherwise not one of the file types for which it does content processing), and cancels the request, transferring nothing of the response body and just printing basic metadata
[14:58:10] <PapuaHardyNet> really? once robomot spent 15 minutes before printing a message for a video I linked, which implied that robomot downloaded the entire 0.5G video
[14:58:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Using a HEAD request would mean that you'd then have to connect again, send another request, if you decided (on the basis of the response headers) to actually retrieve the resource

[15:06:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Someone made a similar point on DSL recently, about stuff like AMF vs. investment in local industry. Of course, they made the point in the context of a critique of EA, for which it doesn't really work at all (it's the wrong level of analysis), but if we're trying to "solve the problem", broadly speaking, then yeah, it absolutely makes sense to say "if it's not a systemic solution that's rooted in the local culture, economy,
[15:06:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  communities, etc., then it doesn't really solve anything"

[15:08:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, do we think it works the other way? "If we only defeat malaria for Africa, if we can just do that for them, they'll become rich"?
[15:08:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ain't gonna happen
[15:08:04] <nshepperd2> the gene drive method seems more likely to work

[15:08:27] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, indeed that is part of the logic because malaria depresses iq heavily

[15:08:52] <kuudes> in europe the getting rich was done by someone starting industrial revolution
[15:09:23] <kuudes> we can't build new coal plants into africa
[15:09:31] <kuudes> I guess we could donate them free nuke plants or something?
[15:09:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not impossible! If we actually *eliminate malaria* (as opposed to "save people from dying from malaria, via continuous investment/intervention"), and if this has the effect of raising average IQ ... etc.
[15:09:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then it *could* be the best solution long-term
[15:10:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand the "to defeat malaria we need to conquer africa" view is *at least* as plausible.
[15:10:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which could even include coal plants! Why can't we build some in Africa? Do they not have coal?)

[15:11:23] <kuudes> or how much was it
[15:11:26] <kuudes> musk has calculated it
[15:11:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok so nothing actually prevents us from building more coal plants and burning more coal
[15:11:38] <kuudes> we need to remove the coal we have burned in last 200 years

[15:12:39] <kuudes> how so they are not succeeding?
[15:13:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Well, yes. The thing is that people die from all sorts of reasons. There's no a priori reason why it can't be the case that building any given coal plant in any given location can't be net-positive in lives or QALYs or w/e

[15:17:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Anyway, I agree that opposing gene drives is bad, so the argument the guy's making on twitter is dumb, but the article he links to makes a lot of sense; it criticizes bed nets (rightly!) and notes that economic development is certain to reduce malaria prevalence (also reasonable!)
[15:17:37] <nshepperd2> it says it's not in stock so the price seems meaningless
[15:17:58] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: fair enough
[15:19:07] <kuudes> it seems to me that bednets indeed work
[15:19:14] <kuudes> and we should keep spamming them

[15:26:01] <feep[work]> don't reduce*

[15:26:14] <feep[work]> so if you remove bednets, it goes right back
[15:26:27] <feep[work]> what you want is interventions that reduce malaria at all succeeding timesteps

[15:27:38] <feep[work]> wait, it has to go in a cycle?
[15:27:41] <kuudes> yes

[16:00:07] <capisce> kuudes: why?
[16:00:32] <kuudes> we don't need to solve all world's problems now in this talk.
[16:01:12] <kuudes> meh
[16:01:24] <capisce> both are caused by mosquitoes, so if it's possible to kill two birds with one stone that might be preferable
[16:01:43] <kuudes> it just seems weird that when we sort of came to agreement that malaria is solveable and ok, you want to move to next problem
[16:02:03] <capisce> seems you're not solving the root cause though
[16:02:17] <kuudes> yes. malaria is going away
[16:02:26] <kuudes> I am not solving aids either
[16:02:43] <kuudes> bednets are not condoms and they won't solve aids either, therefore bednets are bad
[16:02:44] <capisce> what if aids could be solved by eradicating mosquitoes?
[16:03:04] <PapuaHardyNet> that sounds like a plan worth funding
[16:03:39] <capisce> maybe bednets are causing more harm than benefit, if they're distracting from an even better solution
[16:04:05] <kuudes> that seems unlikely
[16:04:17] <kuudes> you are doing whataboutism, it seems to me
[16:04:25] <kuudes> why?
[16:04:28] <feep[work]> kuudes: the argument is that this may shift the cost/benefit of bednet alternatives if they get a solution to another problem for free

[16:06:28] <kuudes> bednets are a thing that works and one can fund. you are free to fund whatever you prefer of course
[16:07:26] <kuudes> and it indeed seems bednets bring ridiculous amounts of qalys per money

[19:54:24] <zebrask> PapuaHardyNet: Is that the conclusion to draw? That response seems more like it's saying that you shouldn't update either way about it.
[19:54:59] <zebrask> Though I'm not sure if completing a physics PhD is the "good" outcome in this case üòõ
[19:55:00] <gwern> it's more that a high GRE is necessary but not sufficient. the range restriction is *because* once you filter on 'necessary', it can no longer predict much
[19:55:09] <gwern> you spent its predictive power already!
[19:55:41] <gwern> you can't take your group predicted to have high success based on a variable, and then use the variable *again* to predict within that group who will have high success
[19:56:21] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, I see. because universities I apply to use GRE as a filter, they can't be used to predict above average results for the cohort that gets in
[19:56:39] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, my message was simply an implicit acknowledgement to gwern's message and a thanks for informing me
[19:56:48] <gwern> yeah. imagine the extreme case of a university which admits only 1600 SAT students
[19:57:00] <zebrask> gwern: Er, at a high level it seems like you can, right? You just can't say that the variable is useless because it doesn't work within the subgroup.
[19:57:23] <gwern> zebrask: it's useless after you've made use of it
[19:57:56] <gwern> (or maybe a better example would be, imagine a university which admits only 1550-1600 students)
[19:59:10] <zebrask> gwern: Only if it's a pure threshold effect and you are just playing with the noise.
[19:59:48] <zebrask> Like if you admit anyone with SAT >1200 you've made use of the SAT and it might still be the case that 1600 SAT students are more likely to succeed than 1200 SAT students.
[20:01:30] <zebrask> Not disagreeing with your general point, though. This restricted range thing is totally common and leads to all kinds of bonkers headlines.
[20:03:08] <zebrask> I think the canonical example used to explain it to me was something like some internal Google studies where they said that humanities background or some other completely-unrelated-to-programming skill was a better predictor of success than programming skill or whatever the quantifiable variables here were. The issue being that they've already dramatically restricted the range of programming skill so that the only people in the study were
[20:03:08] <zebrask> expert level programmers.
[20:05:25] <zebrask> It's possibly true that the other variable was a better predictor within that restricted range, but that's basically because you've already "controlled for" the most important variable with an extremely strict filter.
[20:08:41] <gwern> that sounds more like berkson than range restriction

[20:22:18] <zebrask> "In 2013, Google decided to test its hiring hypothesis by crunching every bit and byte of hiring, firing, and promotion data accumulated since the company‚Äôs incorporation in 1998. Project Oxygen shocked everyone by concluding that, among the eight most important qualities of Google‚Äôs top employees, STEM expertise comes in dead last."
[20:22:49] <PapuaHardyNet> STEMfags btfo (sarcasm)
[20:23:07] <gwern> yes, that sounds like berkson's paradox. conditional on being hired/not-fired/promoted...
[20:23:54] <zebrask> Part of it may be Berkson, but I think a lot of it is basically just that Google mostly hires people at the top end of STEM distribution, whereas the other qualities all had big ranges.
