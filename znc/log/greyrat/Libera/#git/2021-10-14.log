[10:12:36] <euouae> mdk: I think maybe the easy way out is to create a new branch, apply all the commits on top and basically turn the history into a linear one?
[10:13:38] <mdk> euouae: that's what's a `git rebase -i` would do anyway, yes, those are equivalent, the `git rebase -i` way is more automated, the `manually create branch and cherry pick what you want` is the ... manual way

[11:03:57] <bookworm> not only no
[11:04:09] <bookworm> --set-upstream-to
[11:04:33] <euouae> oh my bad -- I thought 'upstream' was not used as a term
[11:04:38] <euouae> apologies
[11:04:39] <j416> dob1: "upstream" usually means "remote tracking branch" or "remote repo" or "repo which I forked off of"
[11:06:55] <j416> branch@{upstream} (or branch@{u}) (remote tracking branch); --set-upstream-to (remote repo) as mentioned
[11:07:03] <dob1> sorry for newbie questions, but I really don't understand the use of this feature. If I have 2 branches, main and dev, and I push them to a remote,  why I need to set upstream?  what will change?
[11:07:38] <j416> dob1: it's the difference of having to specify "git push origin main" every time, or just being able to run "git push"
[11:08:11] <j416> dob1: .git/config contains config saying that your branch "main" has its upstream (remote tracking branch) set to for example origin/main
[11:08:52] <j416> dob1: if you have set up your prompt to show info like ahead/behind, this will also use the configured upstream

[14:19:53] <Rashad> osse: And cherry-pick means that I can get to choose which ones exactly get copied?
[14:20:29] <osse> that's one way of putting it, I guess
[14:20:52] <ikke> Rashad: the main usecase for cherry-picking is to back / forward port changes
[14:21:02] <osse> cherry-pick puts the new commit(s) directly on the branch where you are now (as if you did all the work by hand and used git commit).
[14:21:27] <Rashad> Aha.
[14:21:35] <osse> but yeah if you squint you can sort of view a rebase as a serial cherry-pick
[14:22:18] <Rashad> Right now I think rebase is something you must learn if you're going to use git seriously, especially in a team, which is why I am learning this.

[14:23:14] <Rashad> If you are a project maintainer and you know how to rebase including using cherry-picking and whatnot, would that be "enough" or would you say there is something as crucial as rebase that needs to be addressed?
[14:23:47] <Rashad> I am assuming knowing how to rebase means you know what commits and branches and remotes are and how to push and pull and fetch.
[14:24:26] <Rashad> (And the details that come with such things like what is a master branch and what is a feature branch and what is a good way to arrange branches into development and production, etc)

[22:49:17] <nedbat> jmd: so you would commit your .o, .pyc, .cache/*, etc files to git?
[22:49:20] <rafasc> that's basically its entire point. If you want status to show ignored fiels, use --ignored.
[22:49:22] <jmd> Either a file should exist, or it shouldn't.  If it should exist then one should add it using git add.  If it shouldn't exist then I want to know about it when it appears.

[22:50:32] *** Joins: ZacSharp (~ZacSharp@user/zacsharp)
[22:50:54] <jmd> Well if the rest of the world wants to commit (either advertently or inadvertently) their build artifacts, that is their choice.
[22:50:58] <rafasc> so you track your compiled artifacts?
[22:51:19] <nedbat> jmd: the world doesn't want to commit their build artifacts. they prevent it with .gitignore.
[22:51:25] <nedbat> jmd: it sounds like you want to commit them.
[22:51:53] <jmd> No.  I don't.  That is why I want to see them.  I DONT want them to be ignored.
[22:52:06] <nedbat> jmd: so you always completely clean them before committing?
[22:52:07] <rafasc> or work in projects that do not generate intermediate files.
[22:52:11] <jmd> ???
[22:52:19] <jmd> Why would I do that?
[22:52:30] <nedbat> jmd: tell us how you avoid committing the build artifacts
[22:52:42] <jmd> nedbat: I never add them
[22:52:56] <nedbat> jmd: but you have to constantly see them in your git status then?
[22:53:12] <rafasc> how do I deal with git status becoming unusable because there's literally thousands of lines of untracked files?
[22:53:26] <rafasc> that idea may work with small projects, but doesn't work at scale.
[22:54:12] <ZacSharp> isn't there a per repo (or per worktree?) location to add ignored files without the ignore file itself being in the repo?

[22:54:26] <jmd> nedbat: No.  Normally they should not be shown.  But if due to some mistake they do appear, then I WANT git status to list them.  Then I know something has gone wrong and can do something about it.  Otherwise there is a big risk of them getting committed by mistake.
[22:54:43] <rafasc> if you're trying to say that .gitignore files should not be committed, to prevent people forcing rules, I would partially understand. But ignore is a needed feature.
[22:54:51] <rafasc> ZacSharp: yes .git/info/exclude
[22:55:13] <nedbat> jmd: what keeps the build artifacts from being shown?
[22:55:16] <jmd> I have never found a valid use for them.  and I have seen them cause a lot of trouble.
[22:55:50] <jmd> nedbat: They are not shown because they are not (or at least should not be) in the source tree.
[22:56:01] <rafasc> jmd: you don't use git clean?
[22:56:08] <jmd> sometimes I do.

[22:57:10] <rafasc> for me, the main problem is that most people do not realize that .gitignore is not just for ignoring files. It's to ignore disposable files.
[22:57:28] <rafasc> that's where most of the pain about ignores come from.
[22:57:32] <nedbat> rafasc: what's the distinction you're making there? How are people using it wrong?
[22:58:24] <rafasc> nedbat: gitignore was introduced to deal with intermediate files from compilation. Files that are generally considered trashable.
[22:58:47] <jmd> But that is a problem with the build system.
[22:58:55] <nedbat> rafasc: what have you seen of people using it for other things?

[22:59:36] <jmd> If a compiler dumps crap in the source tree, that compile is buggy.  Adding the .gitignore feature means that the compiler bug is just hidden.
[22:59:46] <rafasc> nedbat: ignoring configuration files, for example.
[23:00:05] <nedbat> rafasc: ah, right. "I need my own dev config"
[23:00:19] <rafasc> nedbat: see !config
[23:00:19] <gitinfo> nedbat: [!configfiles] It is recommended to store local configuration data in a file which is not tracked by git, but certain deployment scenarios(such as Heroku) may require otherwise. See https://gist.github.com/1423106 for some ideas

[23:08:30] <jmd> Yeah I don't.  It's just annoying that whenever I start a new repo I have to write a server side hook to stop people pushing .gitignore files.
[23:09:20] <rafasc> yeah, but now you broke the rule. Because you're kind forcing other people to play by your rules.
[23:09:56] <jmd> Collaboration in a project requires that the team members adhere to basic rules.

[23:33:57] <tnecniv> hello. i'm trying to resolve an issue where i committed a file that is way too large and i need to remove it without removing the commit history. basically i committed an Jupyter notebook that had some fancy images in it that made it over 100MB. This was a number of commits ago and I'm just noticing now. As the notebook is part of the codebase, I
[23:33:57] <tnecniv> dont want to mess with the commit history, but I can't currently push the project to my repository. I've already made the pertinent file appropriately svelte in the most recent commit.

[23:35:01] *** Quits: fercell (~ferr@185.65.50.88) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[23:35:04] <rafasc> you can git rm --cached <big file>; git commit.
[23:35:10] <tnecniv> most of the options i found seem like they purge things quite aggressively
[23:35:19] <tnecniv> that won't delete the actual file, will it
[23:35:34] <tnecniv> just the cache?
[23:35:34] <rafasc> basically that will create a new commit without that file in the repo.
[23:35:58] <rafasc> no, if you use --cached, it will not remove the file from your local machine.
[23:36:14] <tnecniv> because the notebook is important i dont want to delete it from the disk
[23:36:25] <rafasc> if you use git rm <file>; it deletes from your local disk and from the git repo.
[23:36:43] <rafasc> --cached will not delete if from disk.
[23:37:15] <tnecniv> and presumably this deletes the old version that's huge from whatever blob its in
[23:37:22] <rafasc> this part is a bit of a joke: even if it did, since you committed the file, you would be able to recover most of the changes :D
[23:37:42] <tnecniv> haha true
[23:37:56] <rafasc> that doesn't delete anything on the server. That 100mb file will be there forever.
[23:38:26] *** Quits: alkino (~quassel@user/alkino) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:38:27] <tnecniv> no the 100MB file is only local because github is rejecting my pushes since the payload is too big
[23:38:47] <rafasc> ah...
[23:39:07] <tnecniv> since i've been committing and pushing via PyCharm, i didnt notice until now
[23:39:13] <tnecniv> the error message is quite small
[23:39:16] <rafasc> then you probably want to edit your local commits, rewrite the local history, then push.
[23:39:29] <tnecniv> how does one do that
[23:39:40] <rafasc> the rm --cached will not solve your problem because the blob is there on the history.
[23:40:07] <tnecniv> right
[23:40:24] <rafasc> there are multiple ways. a rebase is one of the easiest if your history is simple.
[23:41:08] <rafasc> but rebase is a bit of a more advanced operation.
