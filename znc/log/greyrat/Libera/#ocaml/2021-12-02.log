[00:38:01] <rgrinberg> companion_cube why do you want to re-export lwd from nottui?
[00:39:32] <companion_cube> o/
[00:39:42] <companion_cube> to only have to care about one module.
[00:39:50] <companion_cube> this needs to be as fluent as possible
[00:39:53] <companion_cube> btw /j #lwd :)
[00:40:43] <rgrinberg> I don't think it's a good idea. it is notoriously confusing for tooling and navigation
[00:41:12] <rgrinberg> you end up having to goto definition twice everywhere, the docs are duplicated, compilation slows down
[00:41:59] <companion_cube> compilation would slow down imperceptibly
[00:42:31] <rgrinberg> I think the slow down is proportional to the size of the interface of Lwd :)
[00:43:13] <companion_cube> yeah and it's tiny
[00:43:37] <rgrinberg> Anyway, it's just my experience from working with async/core which insist on re-exporting everything everywhere.
[00:43:39] <companion_cube> btw, since you're here: is there an equivalent of @check that doesn't try to compile non-installable stuff?
[00:43:45] <rgrinberg> It's awful and creates a maze
[00:43:48] <companion_cube> (ie doesn't try to compile benchmarks and other things)

[00:44:16] <rgrinberg> it depends on how your organized your sources
[00:44:29] <rgrinberg> if you have a directory that includes everything but the benchmarks you could do dune build @src/check
[00:44:48] <companion_cube> here it's in the context of yojson, and opam-ci
[00:44:52] <rgrinberg> But usually in this case I just let the check fail on the benchmarks repeatedly
[00:44:52] <companion_cube> ocaml-ci? whatever
[00:45:18] <rgrinberg> hmm so why do you run @check in ci?
[00:45:28] <companion_cube> idk, it seems to be part of ocaml-ci
[00:46:58] <rgrinberg> no idea then, but you do lose out if the benchmarks aren't tested with @check, no?

[16:21:54] <d_bot> <d4hines> I'm working on several event-driven applications (e.g. web servers, user interfaces, etc.). I really like the Elm architecture, which has you describe a state transition function that maps a state and a transition to a new state and a list of side effects to perform (which could include new state transitions). This pattern includes a lot of boiler plate, but it's _easy_ boiler plate, and it allows you reason about and test your s
[16:21:54] <d_bot> <d4hines>
[16:21:56] <d_bot> <d4hines> Is there a good library for doing this pattern in OCaml? Ideally it would be completely independent of UI concerns and have good performance.
[16:21:57] <d_bot> <d4hines>
[16:21:58] <d_bot> <d4hines> I could roll it by hand with the OCaml React event library (not reactjs), but this pattern is only one concrete instance of the things you can do with React.
[16:26:20] <d_bot> <VPhantom> @d4hines I only know of <https://github.com/LexiFi/ocaml-vdom> which is described as "the Elm architecture and vdom for OCaml" but I haven't played with it.
[16:29:43] <d_bot> <d4hines> VDom is related to browser interfaces I assume. Browser interfaces are one instance of a reactive application. But I'm interested in other reactive applications, such as web servers.

[17:24:29] <Anarchos> how come my cmxa files could be incompatible ? Is there a mean to verify which one is a too old version of the lib ?
[17:26:51] <octachron> You can use ocamlobjinfo to check the hash of linked modules.
[17:27:36] <octachron> If this is the installation where you copied by hand dynlink.cmxa, it sounds like you have a mismatched version of dynlink and stdlib.
[17:30:55] <Anarchos> octachron yes it is, but what is strange is that all the cmxa have been compiled by "make" at same time
[17:33:36] <octachron> You should probably try to start from make clean. There is some intermediary state that is not handled correctly in the interaction of dynlink's abbreviated-compilerlibs and the rest of the build.
[17:33:40] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Oh I didn't know Elm was used server-side. Interesting.

[19:08:07] <octachron> "opam switch reinstall" might work depending on how you installed the switch.

[19:13:32] <companion_cube> there's a long standing issue in cmdliner to be able to do that, I think
[19:13:39] <companion_cube> (generating shell completions)
[19:14:14] <Anarchos> octachron i did "opam switch create 5.00.0+trunk ; opam pin ocaml"
[19:14:20] <haesbaert> ah nice
[19:17:11] <octachron> companion_cube, since 4.12, but as stated in the documentation, the implementation is trivial on a non-multicore version of OCaml.
[19:18:02] <companion_cube> yeah that's cool

[19:18:54] <companion_cube> I mean, it's really better than a naked mutex in many cases

[19:24:30] <companion_cube> that seems right
[19:24:46] <companion_cube> if you don't allocate, this stuff is atomic
[19:25:01] <companion_cube> afaik
[19:25:15] <octachron> I am not familiar enough with multithreading. This might be the right time to ask. Or maybe just after multicore is merged in trunk?
[19:25:30] <companion_cube> multicore changes everything tho :p

[19:25:40] <companion_cube> this will still hold among threads in one domain, afaiu

[19:33:14] <Anarchos> octachron no it is the name of directory containing my git clone of the source code

[21:59:41] <Anarchos> octachron. It just finished. what path should i verify ?
[22:00:53] <octachron> You should check that dynlink.cmxa was built and installed.
[22:01:21] <Anarchos> it is not installed

[22:01:42] <Anarchos> but it is compiled in otherlibs/dynlink
[22:08:54] <Anarchos> octachron i found the trouble : in configure.ac, i put the natdynlink for haiku 32 bits, but not for haiku 64 bits.

[23:56:48] <companion_cube> octachron: the multicore report for november mentions "C11 compiler" which means dropping MSVC
[23:56:54] <companion_cube> is there a reason not to use C++ instead?
[23:57:01] <companion_cube> C++11 support is quite widespread at this point
