[01:00:58] <alerque> shem: As somebody who has done and still does some Debian packaging, 99 times out of 100 the package changelogs are useless.

[02:08:06] <GaM3r2Xtreme> sheep: I'll have to look into apache or nginx a little more. I've heard about them, but that's about as much as I know. I guess instead of having a systemctl service started up for each of these programs, would apache or nginx be the one to control launching the services in the background so they have "control" of the webpages?

[02:10:23] <Repentinus> Apache or nginx would still be launched by something, typically these days systemd.
[02:10:46] <Repentinus> They do create their own process pool and distribute requests between these processes as they see fit though.
[02:12:50] <drop> GaM3r2Xtreme: You'd still need to start all your programs separately, but nginx/apache can act as a reverse proxy and forward incoming requests from 127.0.0.1/program to 127.0.0.1:<program port>.

[09:32:53] <alschaapman> If it's true that the old channel is still active, what they're doing at this point is deceptive -- taking advantage of people who have come to expect an Arch presence on that network, and who don't know that something has changed

[09:35:31] <Mysterytrain> has archlinux.org itself been updated to notify users to come here?

[09:36:21] <Mysterytrain> great
[09:36:29] <alschaapman> Mysterytrain: That's what I meant by "additional" news bulletin, yes. There is already a notice about the migration to libera.chat, but it was posted before the knuckle-draggers who now form Freenode's staff took over the #archlinux channel, so there's no mention of that
[09:36:58] <alschaapman> And yeah, if you want to piss on Andrew Lee, there's always plenty of that in offtopic
[09:37:05] <Mysterytrain> heh

[09:38:08] <kevr> no need to apologize; we thank you for trying to keep people informed. But let's keep this channel topical; there are offtopic channels where you can chat about it in more depth

[17:15:01] <nahtjona> I'm not really sure tbh, I'm guessing bios because the utility that launches when I press <del> looks quite outdated, 'Aptio Setup Utility'
[17:15:27] <grawity> the appearance has nothing to do with it
[17:15:41] <grawity> if it has a "legacy boot" or "secure boot" option in the first place, it's unambiguously UEFI
[17:15:58] <grawity> otoh there have been fancy graphical BIOS setup screens as far back as 1990s
[17:16:43] <nahtjona> I used fdisk to create the partition table, `mkfs.vfat -F32` to format the only primary partition i created, and then `dd bs=4M if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/sdX`
[17:17:01] <nahtjona> then uefi it is, I have both of those options
[17:17:01] <mongy> ventoy is your friend
[17:17:06] <grawity> okay, so
[17:17:12] <grawity> two problems with that command:
[17:17:12] <mongy> assuming nothing else is wrong
[17:17:35] <grawity> 1) if you 'dd' something over /dev/sdX, that writes it right over any partition tables or filesystem formatting
[17:17:52] <grawity> the partitions you created/formatted become irrelevant since dd just overwrites them
[17:18:04] <grawity> but more importantly 2) the Windows ISO is literally just that, an ISO 9660 image for CDs/DVDs
[17:18:22] <grawity> it doesn't have any of the "hybrid ISO" stuff that makes it dd'able from non-CD media, like Linux ISOs tend to have
[17:19:39] <nahtjona> 1) makes sense, I just did that because I remembered doing it for linux distros back when i was hoping, makes sense why it would work with linux and not windows now that you mention 2)
[17:19:49] <grawity> to make an UEFI bootable Windows USB stick, do the first two steps again, but instead of dd'ing the ISO file, extract its contents into the vfat filesystem that you just made
[17:20:44] <grawity> the ISO will have an Install.wim that's too large for FAT32 to handle -- use `wimsplit` from wimlib to split it into 2-3 GB chunks
[17:20:57] <chunky> make it chunky

[17:22:33] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[17:22:46] <grawity> haven't tried it but it's there in Microsoft's docs for manufacturers so it's supposed to work
[17:23:26] <Erus_Iluvatar> why not use exfat ? 
[17:23:48] <grawity> UEFI requires FAT for the partition it's supposed to be looking in
[17:24:15] <grawity> the 2nd partition could probably be exFAT, but it doesn't give you much if you need 2 partitions anyway
[17:24:21] <nahtjona> I'm seeing an install.esd file, but mime-type says application/x-ms-wim, I'm guessing wimlib will still work with that
[17:24:22] <grawity> well okay, it's not that UEFI requires FAT
[17:25:01] <grawity> but UEFI defines FAT as the required-to-support filesystem, and it's the only one that works with *all* firmwares, even if some of them have native NTFS stuff
[17:25:06] <colo> grawity, really? I always assumed the ESP needs to be FAT-formatted?
[17:25:06] <Foxboron> grawity: I was wondering, some option rom can be signed, which implies bricking a computer with self-enrolled secure boot keys as they are validated before you can even post. You wouldn't be capable of figureing out signed option rom from linux userspace?
[17:25:15] <colo> ah, interesting.
[17:25:35] <Erus_Iluvatar> It's even worse than that
[17:25:37] <grawity> nahtjona: yeah, ESD files are more or less like WIM ... although is this from an ISO that was made with "Media Creation Tool"?
[17:25:44] <grawity> official ISOs have a WIM file

[17:27:40] <Erus_Iluvatar> From https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_9_2021_03_18.pdf
[17:27:56] <Erus_Iluvatar> he file system supported by the Extensible Firmware Interface is based on the FAT file system.
[17:27:59] <grawity> official ISOs come in all languages, and you can switch language packs on an installed system anyway

[17:28:45] <grawity> Erus_Iluvatar: it's still just a profile/snapshot of FAT, not a derivative that'd need special support
[17:28:52] <nahtjona> last time I had to setup a relatives pc, they came with the windows 10 home version, and apparently the language is locked and I had to do bunch of stuff to change it
[17:28:55] <Erus_Iluvatar> so it's not even a full FAT32 support, but just a ESP format that is the baseline
[17:29:16] <Erus_Iluvatar> so all UEFI should work with the ESP subset of FAT, but anything else is extra
[17:29:16] <grawity> colo: e.g. I think I've heard that Gigabyte motherboards support NTFS natively (and *possibly* exFAT?) but that's of course not universal
[17:29:46] <grawity> colo: and UEFI even has hooks to load external filesystem drivers -- if you make a Windows USB stick with Rufus.exe it'll literally load an UEFI NTFS driver -- but that can cause headaches with Secure Boot

[17:53:49] <phrik> dagle: Say what?
[17:54:19] <mohnish> I'm getting this error when I redirect a usb disk to a linux guest in kvm, using virt-manager, https://dpaste.org/D66q

[17:54:20] <EMIYA> repasted ‚áí https://0x0.st/-LWa.txt
[17:54:34] <grawity> hmm I can't read any option-ROMs on this server, probably because the GPU is asleep or something?
[17:54:52] <mohnish> usb redirect works fine on a windows guest
[17:55:39] <mohnish> I've also tried different distros (ubuntu, and arch), but it doesn't work on either
[17:57:24] *** Joins: pleb66 (~pleb66@user/pleb66)
[17:57:44] <grawity> sounds like a Qemu problem (maybe they didn't anticipate guests doing larger transfers?)
[17:58:09] <mohnish> idk, I wasn't transferring anything
[17:58:27] *** Joins: csmnn (~csmnn@user/csmnn)
[17:58:41] <grawity> the OS looking into the disk to find partitions and filesystems generally counts as a "transfer"
[17:58:42] <mohnish> it would show up as a device in the guest but it would fail to connect (I/O error)
[17:58:52] <mohnish> oh, okay
[17:59:29] <grawity> the numbers in the error message don't look nonsensical -- Linux just tries to read twice as much at once than Qemu allows

[23:36:29] <Repentinus> There is also the option of keeping a small live boot image handy and just booting that if your system is borked by a kernel update, mounting the partitions to /mnt, arch-chrooting there, and installing the pervious kernel and modules from the Pacman cache.

[23:38:48] <Repentinus> Your mileage may vary, but in ~ 10 years of Arch use I have needed to use a live environment to fix my system after a kernel update like twice and one of these occasions was when I was stupid and blindly used `pacman --force` (the option no longer exists).
