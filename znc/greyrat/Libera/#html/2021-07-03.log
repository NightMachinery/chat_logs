[00:22:50] <BenoitRen> This story has also such a header, plus an inline bold header at the bottom. I just used <span> with a class.
[00:23:44] <BenoitRen> Actually no, that bold header is in this one: http://www.pscave.com/fanfic/dezopenguin/thewhispersofdarkness.html

[01:10:41] <BenoitRen> Unrelatedly, I'd also like to know who decided that this is valid: <div>hi I'm just text, not a block element</div>.
[01:20:58] <BenoitRen> It seems like I should use <strong> for labels of paragraphs.

[02:05:16] <Visage> BenoitRen: <div>hi I'm just text, not a block element</div> is perfectly valid, not necessarily correct, but valid. Why wouldn't it be? Please also define "a label of a paragraph".
[02:06:29] <BenoitRen> I don't like that it's valid /because/ it's not correct. <div> used to be just a style hook for block elements.
[02:07:19] <BenoitRen> As for a paragraph label: <p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The preceding text blablabla.</p>.
[02:13:32] <Visage> That's fine for a "label" there, I suppose, and <div> is valid there, because an HTML renderer or validator can't know what your purpose for the element is, at least not until we have better AI. :)
[02:13:54] <Visage> So really, it's a non-issue. Just...don't use div for silly things like that.
[02:23:55] <BenoitRen> I have a problem with it because I've seen lots of websites use <div> like that, for snippets of text. I agree that a renderer can't know what one uses the element for, but that applies to everything, and yet we still have rules as to what can contain what.
[02:30:00] <entuland> I'm sure there are still plenty of websites using tables for layout, probably also trying to use <marquee> and <blink> :P
[02:30:58] <BenoitRen> Yeah, but those rightly get laughed through the door. While with divitis people are still like "...eh".
[02:31:35] <entuland> divitis is surely less "bad"
[02:31:50] <BenoitRen> Than tables for layout? Yeah, I guess so.

[02:31:58] <entuland> it's not like we had plenty of options a few years ago other than div and span

[02:33:18] <entuland> hey, marquee is still supported, blink though (luckily) is not supported anymore :P
[02:33:41] <BenoitRen> I feel old and frustrated when trying to explain semantic HTML to a 25-year-old who think I'm talking rubbish and that HTML is always lagging behind.

[02:34:02] *** Quits: lilmonkey` (~lilmonkey@user/lilmonkey) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:34:20] <entuland> yep semantic html always struggled
[02:35:28] <BenoitRen> In my my mind I'm like "Damn it, I've been busy with these things for years in the 2000s and know how HTML is supposed to be used.".
[02:36:31] <BenoitRen> Anyway, what's your take on fan fiction inserting in-universe headings? How should I mark it up?
[02:37:02] <entuland> the header section should work just fine I guess
[02:38:27] <entuland> <article><header><hN>title</hN><p>introductory text</p></header> ... actual story content whatever the markup </article>
[02:39:05] <entuland> well, <main> around the story
[02:39:26] <entuland> if you really want to
[02:41:22] <entuland> actually, the decision about whether to use <main> or not, to adhere to the rules, depends on whether you have more than one article in the page or not
[02:43:46] <BenoitRen> But what if the header is in the middle, like it is for The Seventeenth Stanza?
[02:44:10] <BenoitRen> I'm inclined to just leave it as regular text and style it with a class, but...
[02:44:20] <entuland> I don't get the reference
[02:44:42] <BenoitRen> It's one of the stories I linked above: http://www.pscave.com/fanfic/dezopenguin/theseventeenthstanza.html
[02:45:15] <entuland> all of what comes before "to the believer" is introductory text?
[02:46:02] <entuland> I don't understand why you wrote "header in the middle"
[02:48:44] <BenoitRen> The story is quoting part of the book the person is reading. "TO THE UNBELIEVER" is, presumably, a header in that book.
[02:49:11] <BenoitRen> Everything before that is definitely not introductory.
[02:49:55] <BenoitRen> I said "header in the middel" because it's not at the start or end of the story.
[02:51:41] <entuland> if in the context of the story, from the POV of the narrator, that second half (from "to the unbeliever" downward) is a quote, you should probably put the book title in a _heading_ (not a header) and the actual quote in a blockquote
[02:52:58] <BenoitRen> My understanding is that blockquote is to quote from somewhere else on the web. Given that this is a fictional book, is that still valid?
[02:53:32] <entuland> I believe that using a cite / blockquote is valid even if it's a fictional book within the story
[02:58:19] <Visage> Blockquote is for any extended quotation. That quote can come from _any_ source, not just the web. Yes, that includes from a book.
[02:59:00] <entuland> I believe the concern was mainly due to the book itself only existing within the story (the book being fictional itself)
[02:59:07] <Visage> If it does indeed come from the web, or anything else where a URI can be used to cite the source, then you can use the cite attribute to do so.
[02:59:42] <Visage> It's still a source, so you can still freely quote it.
[03:00:26] <BenoitRen> Something like this? <blockquote><h2>TO THE UNBELIEVER</h2><p>Lorem ipsum dolor</p></blockquote>
[03:00:43] <entuland> looks okay to me
[03:01:18] <entuland> honestly not entirely sure about using the heading cause it may be mistaken as a heading of your entire document / page
[03:01:31] <entuland> not sure what you should be using there to mark that title there
[03:01:38] <Visage> Yeah, be careful of the heading there.

[03:06:02] <BenoitRen> Yeah, that's exactly my concern.
[03:06:15] <BenoitRen> With all in-universe headers, really.
[03:10:07] <BenoitRen> So I should not use <main> if the only content on the page is an <article>?
[03:11:23] <entuland> the other way around, you could use main only when you have a single story
[03:11:34] <entuland> so that there is one single "main" content of your page
[03:11:58] *** Joins: HarveyPwca (~HarveyPwc@2601:246:c180:a570:29df:3b00:ad0e:3a06)
[03:12:14] <entuland> if you're going to put multiple stories in a single page, you can't have multiple <main> according to the spec (well, you can't have more than one "non-hidden" <main> )
[03:12:58] <BenoitRen> I understand I can use <main> only once. :)
[03:13:19] <entuland> yeah, you can only use <main> once in any given page, to keep it simple
[03:13:22] <BenoitRen> If I don't use <article> inside it, though, I can't use a <header> for when there's introductory text.
[03:13:41] <entuland> why shouldn't you use <article>?
[03:13:49] <entuland> your page will contain nav bars and decoration and other stuff
[03:13:53] <lilmonkey`> If you have multiple stories/articles/whatever on a page, are those together not the main content?
[03:14:01] <entuland> using <article> is good to mark the story
[03:14:20] <BenoitRen> You just suggested to only use <main> when there's a single story.
[03:14:32] <entuland> yep, you can have multiple <article> inside a <main>
[03:14:59] <BenoitRen> It sounded to me like when there's only one <article>, you can just leave it out.
[03:15:12] <entuland> nah, I may have expressed myself badly
[03:15:19] <BenoitRen> I see.
[03:16:15] <entuland> using <main> inside the only <article> of a page would be okay, but for consistency if you have multiple stories in the same page, better to stick using <main> just to mark whatever is not navigation of your site, or something
[03:16:59] <entuland> I can't find anything against using a <header> inside a <blockquote>, unless you come across something quite convolute such as a story quoting a large passages that include multiple headings, you could probably get away with <blockquote><header>title</header> actual quote text</blockquote>

[03:18:42] <BenoitRen> I guess I could also use <blockquote> for the journal that's being quoted in the following one, but I'm not sure what to do about the those 'inline headers'. I don't think they're the same as previously mentioned paragraph labels: http://www.pscave.com/fanfic/dezopenguin/coldmoonlightfire/chapter6.html
[03:19:39] <BenoitRen> Sorry to ask so much; I'm really struggling with this specialised use-case.
[03:19:48] <entuland> you can use a simple <strong> to mark those dates at the beginning of each line
[03:20:06] <entuland> it's not that _everything_ has a corresponding semantic element that fits perfectly
[03:21:15] <entuland> consider that if the text itself is enough to "convey" what it is about, you may not even need any element as a wrapper
[03:21:18] <BenoitRen> I know, but when things get really specific, I feel I don't have enough experience and know-how to make a judgment.
[03:21:24] <entuland> the date and the colon could suffice to mark them
[03:21:39] <entuland> say, a silly example, from the specs: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#conversations
[03:22:11] <entuland> one could think "hey, I wanna go semantic, I should wrap the names in an element" but punctuation there is normally enough
[03:22:11] <BenoitRen> Oh $DEITY, conversations. You do know that I'm the whole reason that entire exchange with the fisherman is there, right?
[03:22:35] <entuland> no, I don't get your reference
[03:23:09] <entuland> granted, if you want to take advantage of some nifty features such as changing the voice of the speaker in actual TTS, you could wrap names and actual sentences with plenty of markup
[03:24:11] <BenoitRen> The third example in that section you linked has an entire exchange with a fisher. That got there because I asked a mark up question related to video game scripts, which have more than one flow if choices are involved.
[03:24:45] <entuland> noice
[03:24:53] <entuland> were you aware that that section was there?
[03:25:06] <BenoitRen> Oh, yes. I'm just surprised to be linked to it.
[03:25:25] <entuland> well, you're kinda asking stuff that goes very close to that subject
[03:25:37] <BenoitRen> Yup. :)
[03:25:46] <entuland> :)
[03:28:08] <entuland> uhm... I have a very clear recollection of ways you could mark sentences up so that they would be read out with, say, a male and a female voice in a dialogue
[03:28:21] <entuland> but for the life of me I can't find the references anymore
[03:28:46] <entuland> stuff I messed with more than a decade ago
[03:31:13] <entuland> now that I think about that, BenoitRen, if you managed to interact with the specs guys there and get them to put that sample there, maybe you can poke them again and ask about this "scoping" of the headings
[03:32:05] <entuland> I mean, I can imagine a scenario where a website is allowed quoting large parts of other websites for whatever reason, and that may imply having to verbatim copy the heading level from the source
