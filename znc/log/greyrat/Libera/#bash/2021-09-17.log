[00:00:34] <twkm> as e36freak quoted, no restrictions when rbash knows it is invoking a (ba)sh script.
[00:01:36] <twkm> possibly it should be reflected so source'd scripts can adapt, but generally you don't mix restricted with unrestricted.
[00:01:37] <cryptonector> twkm: no, that's not right
[00:01:59] <cryptonector> if I run   rbash somescript   then rbash will run that script in restricted mode
[00:02:03] <cryptonector> I've confirmed this
[00:02:38] <cryptonector> that quote from the rbash man page is about programs in $PATH that the script might run -- those will execute w/o restrictions (unless their interpreter is also rbash)
[00:02:57] <cryptonector> I'm not mixing restricted and unrestricted code
[00:03:33] <cryptonector> I'm running a script with rbash with $PATH having a single directory in it with just a few programs, all of them scripts that validate their arguments and inputs
[00:03:45] <twkm> that's the first level.  it's the implicit ''. "$BASH_ENV"'' that's not -- rbash knows it will be interpretting a bash script.
[00:04:12] <twkm> hence need to be unrestricted so they can get things done that the user can't do directly, goes the logic.
[00:04:24] <cryptonector> rbash runs $BASH_ENV w/o restrictions, I know, and that's fine
[00:04:39] <cryptonector> I've no problem with that -- I'm specifying the BASH_ENV, after all

[00:05:15] <cryptonector> however, I was hoping that in the BASH_ENV script I could tell if the shell running it is going to then be interpreting a script with restrictions
[00:05:22] <cryptonector> apparently there is no way to do that
[00:05:48] <twkm> hence the [repeat:] possibly it should be reflected so source'd scripts can adapt, but generally you don't mix restricted with unrestricted.
[00:06:10] <cryptonector> obviously I can use an env var to indicate that intent, or maybe I'll just have a different "library" for one case and the other
[00:06:15] <greycat> The entire point of a restricted shell is to create a subservient class of human users, who are not allowed to do *all* the things.  Only the things you let them do.  If one of the things you want to let them do is "run the foobar script", then rbash needs to be able to run the foobar script properly.  If there's a shebang, there's no issue.  The kernel will just run it.
[00:06:53] <greycat> But if foobar has no shebang, then it's executed by bash forking a child shell to read the contents.  If the forked child shell is still restricted, then it won't work.  So in that *one* weird corner case, it'll drop the "r".
[00:07:28] <cryptonector> greycat: indeed, you're explaining the bit of the rbash man page that e36freak quoted, but it's not germane here
[00:07:37] <LuksNuke> what is rbash?

[00:52:25] <cryptonector> Nintendo: well, it is security theater because anything interesting will have escapes you can't restrict, and if you don't allow anything interesting...  but again, the use-case I described really does call for "nothing interesting", and it will be used to run signed, trusted code anyways
[00:52:39] <Friithian>  /bin/false most secure
[00:52:41] <twkm> of course it was attempted to "solve" (perhaps you prefer "paper over") the problems, e.g., an rbash script generally would invoke rvi instead of vi.
[00:52:44] <phy1729> Or SELinux or OpenBSD's pledge or some other not the shell mechanism
[00:53:28] <cryptonector> Nintendo: for initramfs the security will mostly come from secure boot and root of trust measurement via TPMs, allowing for use of PXE boot (which is where the 10MB limitation comes from, because TFTP kinda sucks)
[00:54:48] <twkm> rather pxe sucks -- perhaps you prefer "don't assume unlimited ram".  i've transferred hundreds of megs via tftp.

[17:11:55] <phogg> I assume that in the implementation there is a struct for the variable and it can be allocated (var defined) or not (var undefined), even if the allocated struct has a NUL where the value would go. From that POV it makes sense.
[17:12:21] <phogg> none of it means that the user can put a NUL into a variable

[17:17:31] <wwilliam> Hello i have this bash: nproc: command not found showing in the output of a "script" how do i suppress that message to show I have this:
[17:17:50] <wwilliam> if [[ ! nproc ]] 2>/dev/null ;then
[17:18:09] <Soliton> that will not produce the message in the first place.
[17:18:13] <izabera> remove the [[ ]]
[17:18:30] <wwilliam> izabera: i did not have them before
[17:18:43] <llua> so why did you use them here?
[17:18:43] <wwilliam> I will post whole thing here.
