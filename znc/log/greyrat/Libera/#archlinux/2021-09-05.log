[12:39:43] <KingShark> hi. why would my wlan0 have been blocked?  iwctl device list showed my wifi adapter as powered: off. the iwd service status showed an error about 'Error bringing interface up: Operation not possible due to RF-kill'; i then ran 'rfkill unblock all' and it worked fine. i dont understand why it went into blocked state though
[12:40:07] <NetSysFire> what does rfkill list show?
[12:40:09] <NetSysFire> is it hard blocked?
[12:40:23] <KingShark> its unblocked and working fine now after the rfkill unblock all
[12:40:53] <KingShark> just wondering why it was blocked

[19:28:05] <grawity> those look a lot like custom Xresources settings to me
[19:29:38] <mingdao> Yes.  The reason I says $HOME/.Xresources is not loading is because, for one, the scrollbar is not blue and on the right-hand side.  Also, notice the font size.

[19:31:08] <grawity> the main point is
[19:31:21] <grawity> if your settings weren't being loaded, `xrdb -query` *would not show them*
[19:31:24] <mingdao> grawity: When I issue `xrdb merge .Xresources`, close urxvt, then open it again it looks like this https://0x0.st/-wNA.png

[19:34:35] <grawity> probably because GNOME is told to set the wrong Xft.dpi, which it does *after* loading Xresources
[19:35:03] <grawity> run a diff on `xrdb -query` before vs `xrdb -query` after
[19:35:08] <mingdao> Where and how to change it?  I don't understand that, either ... unless
[19:35:20] <mingdao> I already did, and there's no difference.
[19:35:48] <grawity> then also run a diff on `xprop -root` before and `xprop -root` after
[19:37:11] <mingdao> I think this might have to do with the DPI of the screen, and a Gnome setting of 200%.

[19:45:54] <sammyf> hey there. I have an old DELL vostro3500 with i5-430 here. as far as I know it has some sort of hybrid Nvidia GPU in there too. The KUbuntu Installer gets to the GUI, so I know it works okay. The Archlinux installer, on the other hand, goes right to kernel panic after the probing EDD line. I searched but couldn't find any info on how to get the installer to start correctly. My guess is that it's

[19:52:46] <grawity> it does not have an "xrdb merge" subcommand

[19:55:02] <grawity> no
[19:55:23] <grawity> .Xdefaults isn't wrong, but it used to be the path that Xlib apps *themselves* loaded, without xrdb
[19:55:37] <grawity> after xrdb has loaded something, those apps no longer look at .Xdefaults
[19:55:47] <grawity> (and xrdb itself doesn't care about the file name, it can load either)

[19:56:08] <grawity> I remember rxvt-unicode having some custom code to make it *always* load .Xdefaults manually
[19:56:10] <grawity> or was it xterm?
[19:56:13] <grawity> no, probably urxvt

[19:57:00] *** Joins: tizef (~tyzef@202.153.80.185)
[19:57:01] <grawity> it's not a question that rxvt-unicode does look at RESOURCE_MANAGER in xprop
[19:57:14] <grawity> and if it looks there, then the filename given to xrdb doesn't matter, as long as stuff is being put there
[19:57:32] <grawity> so before I afk for a while
[19:57:39] <grawity> 1) stop using "xrdb merge", it's spelled "xrdb -merge"
[19:57:56] <grawity> 2) your 200% scale results in a large Xft.dpi being set, that's fine but you should adjust your font accordingly

[22:57:34] <tleydxdy[m]> anyone know why xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-wlr depends on each other?
[22:58:05] <[-_-]> okay
[22:58:24] <Edu4rdSHL> [-_-], grep "pacman -Syu" /var/log/pacman.log |tail -1 should work
