[00:00:54] <tnt> In general it's a good idea to "offset tune" so your signal doesn't overal the DC / 0 Hz point. Unless that signal has been specifically designed to tolerate it. (All OFDM derivatives specifically don't use the center bin of the FFT so they're not affected by stuff at DC).

[00:41:12] <drmpeg> DVB-T and DVB-T2 use the OFDM center carrier. When I was using bladeRF for development, I had to null the TX DC offset with the FPGA.
[00:42:19] <tnt> ok, my bad ... some ofdm derivatives are dumb ....
[00:43:59] <drmpeg> I guess DVB-T is so old, it wasn't considered. But yeah, it's a bummer.
[00:57:20] <bpadalino> drmpeg: have you seen anyone doing any atsc 3.0 work? i guess it's all ofdm now .. and up to 4096-QAM
[00:59:01] <drmpeg> Not yet. The rollout is still very slow. Only one station here in Silicon Valley (and it's a weird "Franken FM" one).
[01:00:23] <drmpeg> It's still transmitting an FM carrier on 87.75 MHz. It uses a reduced bandwidth ATSC 3.0 signal and shifts it down ~200 kHz.
[01:00:36] <bpadalino> that sounds so weird
[01:01:25] <drmpeg> Yeah, it's just to stay on the FM band (most tuners will tune 87.75 MHz).
[01:01:55] <drmpeg> It's also low power.
[01:04:46] <drmpeg> I was thinking about asking ATSC if I can obtain the Validation and Verification files. I would pay a little bit for them (like becoming a member of ATSC).
[01:05:05] <bpadalino> that would be neat
[01:05:09] <drmpeg> Then I'd have half a chance at a working TX.
[01:05:16] <bpadalino> do you really need to join to get the files ?
[01:05:20] <bpadalino> that sounds kinda crappy
[01:05:30] <drmpeg> They are not public.
[01:05:58] <bpadalino> that sucks .. their spec is public .. i wonder why they keep those files under lock and key
[01:06:26] <drmpeg> Dunno. DVB-T2 is public.
[01:08:09] <drmpeg> I should send ATSC an e-mail and see what the reaction is.
[01:08:29] <bpadalino> i agree .. good luck with it .. hopefully they give it up
[01:11:13] <drmpeg> Gonna do it right now. No time like the present.
[01:11:28] <bpadalino> if not now, when ?
[01:12:11] <drmpeg> I am a master procrastinator.

[05:31:26] <Guest1> hey guys can we choose non standard FFT Size? say instead of 512 FFT, 516 FFT ? 
[05:35:23] <Guest1> when to use vector to stream and stream to streams? 
[05:39:15] <drmpeg> Vector to stream is usually used to connect a vector block to a block that can do vectors.
[05:39:38] <drmpeg> can't do vectors.
[05:43:20] <drmpeg> Stream to streams is some sort of demultiplexer. Only useful in certain specific applications.
[05:44:10] <Guest1> is stream to streams block as stream demux? 
[05:44:31] <Guest1> stream demux is not present in 3.8.4, but is present in 3.9.2
[05:45:37] <drmpeg> Stream demux is more flexible.
[05:45:50] <Guest1> stream demux  has lenghts option which is very convenient to use than stream to streams,
[05:46:31] <Guest1> Yes. Lets say if i were to take out streams of different using stream to streams, how would i do it? 
[05:47:56] <Guest1> basically I have a 512 FFT, which i want to divide by 12. Cant really divide here. FFT size has to be 516, but this not power of 2. 
[05:48:22] <Guest1> Whats the disadvantage of using "keep M in N" block? 
[05:49:51] <drmpeg> What are you trying to do?
[05:50:17] <drmpeg> From a high-level perspective.

[10:57:30] <matt_mills[m]> can anyone clue me in on what an rf circulator is used for?
[10:59:41] <FelixTRG[m]> its like a "traffic junction" for RF 
[11:00:03] <FelixTRG[m]> basically lets say you put TX on port 1 and you get the rf straigh through on port 2
[11:00:11] <FelixTRG[m]> which is usually going to antenna
[11:00:37] <FelixTRG[m]> if energy from antenna is applied on port 2 i goes down to port 3 which is where RX or LNAs are connected usually
[11:01:16] <FelixTRG[m]> there is a high isolation between ports 1 and 3 so there is quite small risk of damage to the RX side by the TX power
[11:01:32] <matt_mills[m]> ah that makes more sense than what I was imagining, thanks

[11:32:50] <funkylab[m]> for example

[11:34:03] <FelixTRG[m]> yea
[11:34:39] <FelixTRG[m]> you dont have to tell me uWaves arent forgiving, i have my fair share of experience working with 1.7 and 2.2GHz LNBs and modding them (particularly the LNAs and  LOs) 
[11:35:01] <FelixTRG[m]> but thats nothing compared to even higher bands
[11:38:56] <tnt> yeah and -20dB sucks ... it's really not that small if you TX 30 dBm and you have 10 dBm going into your RX ports it's like millions times stronger than your RX ...

[17:31:56] <Guest95> Can we use "Keep M in N " block is there is a sample delay in the system? 
[17:33:23] <DerekKozel[m]> Keep M in N will work with whatever data is at its input. It is not aware of any other processing in the system.

[18:19:30] <Guest95> Ok so lets say, If i will be using an hardware for transmitting and receiving. If there is sample delay in the system , will the usage of "keep M in N" be an issue?  
[18:26:55] *** Joins: saba4ka-mumu (~efsearfc@176.59.55.118)
[18:35:33] <Guest95> so if we consider time and frame synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. If they are offset by say an integer number of samples, will "Keep M in N" still work? 
[18:37:12] <Jacob[m]123> the keep M in N block will always "work", its a very simple block; whether this will cause trouble to a greater flowgraph's timing is dependent on exactly what the flowgraph is doing and what sync is happening between the hardware rx/tx

[19:10:33] <funkylab[m]> <Guest95> "so do i have to worry about..." <- that question makes no sense. Every block is in your flow graph for a reason. So by definition, you consider each block as important for your application. Guest95, we can't guess the problem your flow graph is having from "I have a keep M in N block in there"! 
[19:13:08] <funkylab[m]> I think the right way forward here is actually sharing comprehensive information on your flow graph, what it's supposed to be doing – and how it misbehaves. You've got a reason to thing this rather innocent and probably relatively easy to "track down in its reason of existence" block is the problem, so you might want to describe that, too. Make notes, then write here, or an email to discuss-gnuradio@gnu.org. Writing down your problem in
[19:13:08] <funkylab[m]> a way that a stranger understands 100% where you're stuck is definitely a skill that saves **so** much time when developing things, it's worth practicing!

[21:14:45] <schneider> pmt_c32vector uses a std::vector internally. is there a reason for it not use a volk::vector instead?
[21:15:24] <schneider> it would have the benefit that pmt::init_c32vector always returns a properly aligned pointer
[21:15:38] <schneider> (same applies for the other types)
[21:15:58] <Jacob[m]12> this is something i have considered for quite some time. same for f32...

[21:18:54] <schneider> Jacob[m]12: i came across this because i'm feeding the result of pmt::c32vector_elements into fir_filter_ccf::filterNdec
[21:19:13] <schneider> and if the vector is not aligned this technically results in an out of bounds access
[21:19:19] <Jacob[m]12> did you run into segfaults?
[21:19:23] <Jacob[m]12> yeppp
[21:19:45] <Jacob[m]12> https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/3393
[21:19:47] <schneider> didn't see segfaults but other alignment related behaviour
[21:20:00] <schneider> and noticed on the way that there might be something sleeping
[21:20:12] <schneider> Jacob[m]12: oh :)
[21:20:22] <schneider> awesome
[21:20:49] <Jacob[m]12> the streaming API incidentally guarantees this does not manifest as an issue, but there are direct illegal memory accesses problems :\
[21:21:27] <Jacob[m]12> https://github.com/jacobagilbert/gr-pdu_utils/blob/master/lib/pdu_fir_filter_impl.cc#L110-L112
[21:21:46] <schneider> Jacob[m]12: yes
[21:22:13] <schneider> i was expecting exactlu the same issue in gr-pdu_utils
[21:22:17] <Jacob[m]12> so thats the workaround we made, i hate it but the gr kernel is broken for general use
[21:22:32] <schneider> also: the math is not perfectly stable if the alignment changes
[21:23:10] <schneider> so depending on the random alignment of the input vector you get tiny differences in the output
[21:23:30] <Jacob[m]12> that is also true
[21:23:32] <schneider> i don't thing they matter, but it makes it harder to "diff" multiple runs of them
[21:23:37] <Jacob[m]12> this affects the FFT kernels also https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/3519
[21:24:09] <Jacob[m]12> schneider: yeah sometimes the `almost` in `assert_almost_equal` QA needs extra relaxing
[21:24:18] <schneider> haha
[21:25:12] <schneider> so what i tried is to use volk::vector in vor the c32 vector pmt above and that simply compiles/links/works
[21:25:15] <Jacob[m]12> jsallay Josh Morman :VOLK alignment is something that should be considered with PMTF
[21:25:19] <schneider> but i'm not sure where PMTs are heading
[21:25:49] <schneider> s/in vor/for
[21:26:11] <Jacob[m]12> interesting. if this is something that 'just works' i think its worth including in 3.10
[21:26:32] <schneider> it's literally a one line change
[21:26:36] <schneider> (per type)
[21:27:02] <schneider> Jacob[m]12: i'll file a PR for discussion
[21:27:19] <Jacob[m]12> yeah thats a great find. perfect i was just going to suggest that
[21:27:22] <schneider> i wouldn't be surprised if there are some cases i'm not considering
[21:28:10] <Jacob[m]12> unfortunately this does not solve the bugs in the filter kernels but it would be a boon for OOTs (and the in-tree gr-pdu stuff.... i have been holding up on pdu_fir_filter upstreaming because of this)
