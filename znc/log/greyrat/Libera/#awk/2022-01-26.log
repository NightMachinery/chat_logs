[00:18:37] <setuid> Earnestly: This is wrapped inside a Foreman provisioning script (Ruby/erb), which emits a shell script, which is pushed to the host at PXE time and run there, locally... lots of fun escaping, quoting, macro madness. 
[00:20:21] <setuid> I'm trying to splice off `quiet splash` from the default GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX too, using `${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX//quiet splash}` but that's being eaten by the templates/macros/parser too.

[00:39:37] <mknod> Great, because awk doesn't speak wildcards anyway. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:39:48] <Earnestly> yus
[00:40:42] <Patsie> appologies if I'm spamming, but awk-fire got another small update. now with bigger, better flames :) https://github.com/patsie75/awk-fire
[00:41:17] <Earnestly> Patsie: You are welcome to spam
[00:41:41] <Patsie> *bow* thank you
[00:44:32] <Earnestly> Patsie: stty size is both portable and gives you row and column at same time
[00:44:39] <Earnestly> stty size | getline w h
[00:44:58] <Patsie> good tip
[00:46:52] <Patsie> small correction -> getline h w <- "print the number of rows and columns according to the kernel"
[00:47:03] <Patsie> but I'll incorporate it
[00:49:17] <Patsie>   "stty size"  | getline h w
[00:49:17] <Patsie> print "[" w "]x<" h ">"
[00:49:24] <Patsie> []x<37 152>
[00:49:30] <Patsie> something goes wrong there :P
[00:50:32] <Patsie>   "stty size"  | getline 
[00:50:32] <Patsie>   h = $1
[00:50:32] <Patsie>   w = $2
[00:50:39] <Patsie> works better

[18:44:49] <PaulePanter> Hi. I have several categories http://ix.io/3NAz
[18:45:20] <PaulePanter> which I want to use to look through other files, and if one category matches, increase the number for a category.
[18:45:27] *** Quits: geirha (~geirha@user/geirha) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[18:47:39] <PaulePanter> Here is an example file: http://ix.io/3NAB
[19:06:14] <nmz> what a bizarre format
[19:06:24] <nmz> what is increased PaulePanter ?
[19:07:21] <PaulePanter> nmz: It’s a hack from Foswiki I think.
[19:07:52] <PaulePanter> For example, if I see "Linux Workstation" in one of the files, the counter for Linux workstations should increase.
[19:07:59] <user282069> i'd guess increment a value next to the category, ye
[19:08:11] <nmz> but the value seems to be a date
[19:08:15] <nmz> not a number
[19:08:19] <nmz> and it changes
[19:09:20] <user282069> can the output format differ from your categories file?
[19:09:31] <PaulePanter> I’d like to count the number of Linux workstations, Windows workstations, and so on, and later on maybe get more detail according to the delivery date (Lieferdatum) for example.
[19:09:44] <user282069> ye
[19:09:55] <PaulePanter> user282069: No, that is fixed and controlled by me. I can format/edit it as I like.
[19:22:45] * user282069 is stuck in bash thinking ~~~
[19:27:21] <nmz> PaulePanter: whats the output?
[19:27:42] <nmz> I don't know what file is changing or how
[19:27:56] <nmz> honestly the format is terrible
[19:27:59] <user282069> i think you can output however you'd like
[19:28:15] <nmz> yeah but the file has to be changed
[19:28:36] <nmz> its up to PaulePanter
[19:29:55] <user282069> wont all input files be processed before output?
[19:29:55] <Earnestly> nmz: https://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiMetaData
[19:31:45] <Earnestly> This is nightmare zone
[19:33:37] <user282069> i think a line for each category; like  $0 ~ /Windows Workstation/ {ww++} END print each category
[19:33:39] <Earnestly> I would create an intermediate format and then generate ouput
[19:33:46] <Earnestly> output*
[19:33:54] <Earnestly> rather than trying to work with these formats directly
[19:34:27] <nmz> it seems like a shit csv format if you ignore the second line
[19:34:28] <user282069> ahh ye it'll end after each file though
[19:34:36] <Earnestly> Since it's closely related, might be possible to modify twiki forms into xml and then use normal xml parser for attributes
[19:34:59] <Earnestly> The | separated values is whatever
[19:35:36] <Earnestly> That's not a problem to deal with
[19:37:20] <Earnestly> If awk, for example, I would convert the categories into hash table (lut).  Then check if whatever value is under inspection exists as key in table and increment its value, print at end
[19:37:44] <Earnestly> But I have no idea what is being counted, and why
[19:37:53] <Earnestly> "if category matches", matches what?
[19:38:00] <Earnestly> "other files"
[19:38:22] <user282069> the file he linked should match the category linux workstation
[19:38:28] <user282069> and maybe more
[19:38:36] <user282069> what is lut?
[19:38:40] <Earnestly> lookup table
