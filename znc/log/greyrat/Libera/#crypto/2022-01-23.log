[01:15:59] <maroon> what if we dont know who that is?
[01:16:47] <AlienTrooper> maroon, what i have to loose if I don`t know?
[01:17:14] <maroon> someone in here a long time ago mentioned that there were sites that didn't allow someone to set their password to match another user's password - how is that accomplished without informing user#2 that this is a valid password so all i need to do is test it against all accounts?
[01:17:20] <AlienTrooper> Someone is taking IRC too serious...
[01:18:26] <halosghost> maroon: if they used a bloom filter to determine it, then it's not actually guaranteeing that the one you tried is the same as another (just a collision)
[01:18:33] <halosghost> though… that seems like… a dumb idea
[01:19:11] <halosghost> (seems a lot better to just use salts, or better yet a good kdf like {b,s}crypt/argon2)
[01:19:35] <maroon> well halosghost, if it's a decent hash then there should be a really low chance of false positive preventing people from using legit pass
[01:20:52] <halosghost> I mean, the collision-resistance of a bloom filter is easily controllable if you know the element count
[01:21:38] <maroon> halosghost, what i meant was that the site had made a conscious decision to protect their users, so they ban passwords from matching each other, and from matching things on the famous password lists like rockyou

[04:34:36] <int-e> TimMc: well it does include untrusted javascript (google analytics, and another one by Microsoft?) so I wouldn't bet on it being safe even if the proper "app" code computes hashes on the client.
[04:35:45] <int-e> and wth is that code in https://haveibeenpwned.com/cdn-cgi/bm/cv/669835187/api.js
[04:35:53] <int-e> NO, I wouldn't trust that either.
[04:36:29] <int-e> Now if you give me a field where I can input my own SHA1 hash... maybe the story would be different.
[04:36:34] <Peng> https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/ probably
[04:36:42] <Peng> no idea what specifically!
[04:38:40] <int-e> Peng: oh, right. cdn-cgi is Cloudflare's thing
[04:39:42] <int-e> I mean this is all /probably/ fine but this is not how you make your site's code reviewable and minimize dependencies.
[04:41:47] <TimMc> int-e: Oh sorry, no, I meant including an API call to Pwned Passwords in the login flow.
[04:42:10] <TimMc> Entering your password on the Pwned Passwords web page *is* a bit dodgy and I wouldn't do it with any password I wanted to keep.
[04:42:41] <int-e> Ah
[04:45:49] <int-e> I guess publishing a SHA1 hash (even if the audience is small it's not under your control) defeats the purpose of using more expensive password hashes like Argon2 internally.
[04:46:26] <TimMc> Specifically, I had to convince Legal that this was an overall risk reduction, even though it does carry some of its own risk.
[04:46:39] <TimMc> int-e: You've seen the k-anonymity thing it does, right?
[04:46:47] <int-e> I have not.
[04:46:59] <TimMc> Ah! Well, you only send the first 5 hex chars of the SHA-1.
[04:47:14] <int-e> Ah, and you get back a list to check against?
[04:47:24] <TimMc> You get back a set of about 600 hashes and check if the full hash is in that list.
[04:47:28] <int-e> That helps.
[04:48:16] <maroon> Platonides, i wasnt remembering this as a joke, someone was saying in seriousness that their site was doing that - preventing people from using password from dictionary and various wordlists, as well as not being dup of existing user's pass
[04:48:20] <TimMc> If someone *actually* uses a good password, this does increase the attacker's ability to attack that user's password... but not by much, and it's still an online attack.
[04:48:23] <int-e> Eh, I imagine it's an overall win indeed.
[04:48:40] <TimMc> (unless you imagine a situation where the attacker correlates logs on both ends *and* later gets your password hashes DB!)
[04:48:53] <int-e> Just because if you let people pick their own password, a lot of them will be bad.
[04:49:06] <TimMc> In the meantime, like 20% of people use shit passwords, so it's an overall win, yeah.
[04:49:52] <maroon> if you let people pick their own spouse, many of them will be bad...
[04:49:54] <TimMc> (It actually wasn't hard to convince them; I just had to convince other technical people, and Legal was like "welp... if you're fine with this, so are we".)
[04:50:01] <TimMc> maroon: hahaha
[04:50:11] <TimMc> your spouse must contain at least one good character

[20:58:15] <ericonr> I learned about the bloom filter approach in class heh
[20:59:30] <TimMc> I feel like every time I think I've found a use-case for bloom filters they turn out to be not a great solution.

[23:32:19] <Hash> Okj
[23:32:23] <Hash> I need some help folks
[23:32:27] <Hash> Non crypto related help
[23:32:43] <Hash> I got very depressed and very sick and I didn't study for 6 weeks.
[23:32:57] <Hash> I usually do 3 hours a day. So I lost 1.5 months of study which I need to make up
[23:33:21] <Hash> I calculated if I do 5 hours a day for 26 days, I can catch up. But I still have to do the 3 hours a day I normally do.
[23:33:36] <Hash> That means 8 hours a day of study for next basically 4 weeks to catch up.
[23:33:52] <Hash> I need some encouragement and help and motivation and some like good words from maybe someone 
[23:34:07] <Hash> Might help. I normally don't ask and do everything myself but lately not feeling so well. Thanks!
[23:34:16] <riv> wb Hash
[23:34:21] <Hash> Hey thanks man
[23:34:26] <riv> my approach would simply be to continue to do 3h a day
[23:34:36] <riv> I wouldn't try to push yourself to breaking point to catch up
[23:35:28] <Hash> Ok
