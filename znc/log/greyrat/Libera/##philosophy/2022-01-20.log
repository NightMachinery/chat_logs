[12:48:05] <Lumine> No, the friend who started the conversation by asking what truth is wasn't satisfied with my answer, in fact they left right after what I said. I tried to explain that we can't really describe what it is, that by doing so it's like saying what the content of being in love feels like. We can talk endlessly in metaphors and analogies trying to express how we see truth. But we obscure it in our own way by the way we perceive. No point of view
[12:48:05] <Lumine> is identical with another.
[12:49:02] <inhahe_> is the meaning of the word/concept 'truth' in our heads non-semantic?
[12:49:03] <arryana> hm
[12:49:10] <inhahe_> and if it's semantic, shouldn't you be able to describe it?
[12:49:17] <arryana> i always struggle with 'truth' as opposed to 'facts'

[12:50:49] <inhahe_> having said that i'm very sympathetic to the notion that truth is something that can't be universally defined
[12:50:54] <arryana> most truths, so far as i can tell, only stretch as far as a person's skin
[12:51:42] <arryana> for a catholic, their truth is that god is sat in heaven and all that.  similarly true for any embraced unprovable theory

[12:52:29] <arryana> buddhists, muslims, jews, even that guy in here who is always trying to define ever part of life through mathematics.
[12:52:39] <arryana> that's their truth, because they live it.  but it isn't a fact.
[12:53:19] <arryana> personally, i have no problem with most people's truths.  where i run into trouble is when those truths are presented as fact, and imposed on other people
[12:53:57] <arryana> if a truth is self evident, other people will adopt it by choice.  not because it's imposed on them.

[12:54:08] <Lumine> inhale_: I distinguish between a relative truth, and an absolute truth. The latter is what we were mainly discussing last night. Relative truth is any uniquely perceived view held by an individual.
[12:54:26] *** Joins: solaraquarion_ (~solaraqua@pool-72-89-170-171.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[12:54:58] <inhahe_> you could argue that truth is absolute and relative truth is another name for the possibility of being wrongh
[12:55:36] <inhahe_> i would say truth should be said to be either relative or absolute
[12:55:52] <arryana> how would 'absolute truth' be defined, as opposed to a 'fact'?
[12:55:56] <inhahe_> pick a side, otherwise you're talking about two different things
[12:56:26] <inhahe_> aren't facts supposed to be absolute truths?
[12:56:40] <arryana> i don't know.  it isn't my term
[12:56:46] <arryana> that's why i'm asking
[12:57:38] <Lumine> arryana: it can't, that was the problem, it's absolutely useless in trying to define it, because it seemed regress into a relative truth or subjective truth in our conversation.

[13:03:21] <Lumine> It's not really useful, other than engaging in opinions over it. People always have a different way of expressing what they think truth is. I tried my best in expressing my side of it. But as said, they weren't satisfied with leaving it hanging.

[13:12:06] <I_Am_M00t> truth can't feed you, that's the truth
[13:12:19] <Lumine> I've rambled on extensively, writing about what I think is the truth. And whenever I had somebody read it, they've said "that's your side, not mine." So the only real conclusion I've come to about it, aside that it makes people defensive of their own positions, is that we can't make any final statements about it, it seems to change depending on the context.
[13:12:24] <Lumine> The fact that we still don't know what the truth is, which is by the way a hazy concept, is to my mind funny. It's like its function is to make people ask questions, but never to answer them. I don't think we'll ever arrive at a satisfactory description.
[13:12:46] <I_Am_M00t> maybe you cannot point at truths, but only untruths
[13:13:20] <I_Am_M00t> i need a nap
[13:13:27] <inhahe_> Lumine: yeah, that thing about it changing depending on  context is why i used the term 'universal' when i said i'm sympathetic to the notion that there's no universal way to define truth
[13:13:42] <arryana> do you accept other people's truths as your own?
[13:14:21] <inhahe_>  nobody accepts other peoples truths as their own indiscriminately without certain conditions being met
[13:14:27] <I_Am_M00t> when someone claims they know the truth, run the other way üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®
[13:14:34] <Lumine> ^
[13:14:36] <I_Am_M00t> that is the truth
[13:14:38] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t everyone thinks they know the truth
[13:14:49] <I_Am_M00t> is that true though inhahe_ ?
[13:14:55] <arryana> haha, i certainly don't think i know the truth
[13:14:58] <arryana> which is why i stick to factes
[13:15:00] <arryana> -e
[13:15:09] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t some people are more wishy washy about it but even they hold some things as indisputable
[13:15:42] <I_Am_M00t> so everyone claims to know the truth?
[13:15:45] <inhahe_>  no
[13:15:57] <inhahe_> claiming it is incidental though
[13:16:02] <inhahe_>  because everyone knows it either way
[13:16:05] <I_Am_M00t> let me rephrase then, everyone deep inside believe they know the truth?
[13:16:23] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t yes at least regarding certain facts
[13:16:31] <I_Am_M00t> but not regarding everything?
[13:16:32] <I_Am_M00t> :O
[13:16:33] <inhahe_> righmt
[13:16:34] <inhahe_> right
[13:16:45] <I_Am_M00t> well that's a very different situation
[13:16:54] <Lumine> I ask questions, but I have no answers.
[13:17:32] <I_Am_M00t> i am certain that i am a bit sleepy right now
[13:17:32] <amigojapan> brigand: I may not know reality. But there are still some things I would go all in if someone told me I could bet on them
[13:17:36] <I_Am_M00t> quite certain that it's true
[13:18:29] <I_Am_M00t> i will not give that belief up! :D even if a top sleep doctor tells me it's false
[13:18:35] <brigand> i can have an opinion, not the truth
[13:19:04] <inhahe_> maybe the truth is just a certain opinon
[13:19:07] <inhahe_> i
[13:19:39] <amigojapan> brigand: everything I say is just my opinion. I wish everyone knew I imply that in everything I say
[13:20:00] <brigand> if my opinion is challenged i try to fight back. if my truth is challenged i laugh and shrug it off
[13:20:12] <brigand> "the sky is green" ...
[13:20:18] <inhahe_> it's odd to hold an opinion in higher status than truth
[13:20:21] <inhahe_> it's reversed
[13:20:30] <I_Am_M00t> in your opinion it's odd
[13:20:37] <inhahe_> though this could be an issue of how we're using the term truth
[13:20:51] <brigand> ya, semantics too
[13:21:09] <I_Am_M00t> so what is the truth?
[13:21:17] <brigand> your mom

[13:21:24] <I_Am_M00t> many good answers
[13:21:31] <brigand> :D
[13:22:01] <I_Am_M00t> any other *opinions* about the truth?
[13:22:09] <plank> s'alright
[13:22:10] <Lumine> My opinion is that I need coffee
[13:23:00] <arryana> haha
[13:23:09] <amigojapan> brigand: if you put 1 in one input and 1 in the other input of an and gate, is it just your opinion that it will have a 1 in the output? Or is that truth? Or may it display a 0 in the output?
[13:23:15] <brigand> "amigojapan: brigand: I may not know reality. But there are still some things I would go all in if someone told me I could bet on them" you do that because you have facts
[13:23:37] <brigand> i would call that a fact

[13:26:52] <amigojapan> inhahe_: even if it exists we don't have direct access to it
[13:27:12] <inhahe_> amigojapan: that doesn't contradict my definition though
[13:27:30] <I_Am_M00t> how about this, "Assuming statement A is true, is statement A true?"
[13:28:07] <brigand> amigojapan: hmm, isn't that a historical fact?
[13:28:23] <amigojapan> inhahe_: but we should not use the word "fact", cause we can't be 100 percent sure of anything
[13:28:23] <inhahe_> 1+1=3 where 1+1=3
[13:28:35] <I_Am_M00t> that's true

[13:32:48] <I_Am_M00t> i am more powerful than logic! watch me make a logical contradiction and survive!
[13:33:24] <inhahe_> ex contradictione quodlibet, you'll blow up in a puff of  contradictions soon
[13:34:02] <I_Am_M00t> right, that's a more formal way to put it i guess
[13:34:12] <I_Am_M00t> if you make one true logical contradiction, anything can be anything
[13:34:29] <amigojapan> inhahe_: I wonder why the law of noncontradictability seems to be unbreakable. I don't think we know why. Just that it is
[13:34:48] <I_Am_M00t> because it produces a sharp headache if you try to break it
[13:35:02] <inhahe_> amigojapan: i suspect that logic is no more than an underlying principle of our semantic thought
[13:35:07] <amigojapan> Lol I_Am_M00t
[13:35:10] <I_Am_M00t> nobody dares travel too far out it
[13:35:24] <I_Am_M00t> try amigojapan, try to genuinely break something extremely logical
[13:35:36] <I_Am_M00t> see what happens, you'll get drunk
[13:35:49] <Lumine> What makes anything "objective" is that people agree on its properties and principles. You can't deny the *fact* that there is a principle as to how stars die. That is the only reason why we think there is an objective reality out there, because of the rules or principles according to which it moves. We can at least make the statement that they are regular and repeating patterns. But as to whether they are aside from what we think about them
[13:35:49] <Lumine> is another matter.
[13:35:52] <inhahe_> so noncontradiction is unbreakable because breaking it is an ineffective way of thinkingh
[13:36:16] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know if it's "ineffective", maybe it's literally a way out of thinking
[13:36:26] <I_Am_M00t> similar to how it's ineffective to shower without water
[13:36:28] <inhahe_> not thinking is ineffective
[13:36:37] <I_Am_M00t> ok, well... ineffective to what purpose?
[13:36:42] <I_Am_M00t> what if you want to not think
[13:37:00] <inhahe_> well, i think you can't posit a contradiction without thinking
[13:37:07] <I_Am_M00t> yes, sure
[13:37:07] <inhahe_> so violating noncontradiction is thinking
[13:37:13] <inhahe_> not a way out of it
[13:37:22] <I_Am_M00t> but what happens if you start accepting the contradiction too much
[13:37:23] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: I can say the words but I can't even imagine a triangle with 4 sides

[13:38:01] <I_Am_M00t> imagining a triangle with 4 sides is like slapping your brain
[13:38:36] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: if I imagine 4 sides, it becomes a rectangle
[13:38:53] <I_Am_M00t> no no, but it's not a rectangle! it's a üëâ triangle with 4 sides
[13:38:54] <I_Am_M00t> :D
[13:38:58] <amigojapan> Or a trapezoid

[13:39:07] <amigojapan> Hehehe
[13:39:08] <I_Am_M00t> no no amigojapan , it has to be a triangle
[13:39:17] <inhahe_> what kind of truth is a truth by definition?

[13:48:44] <inhahe_> i agree

[14:02:25] <inhahe_> yeah
[14:02:55] <inhahe_> amigojapan: maybe imagination is neither logical nor illogical, only language can be illogical

[14:03:38] <inhahe_> yeah, but language is just a translation

[14:06:32] <inhahe_> lckdscl: some mental language may be involved in thinking, but it's not the entirety of thinking. some aspects of thinking, particularly closer to the source of the generation of our ideas, are beyond semantics
[14:06:50] <inhahe_> i haven't read it all yet though of course
[14:07:37] <inhahe_> lckdscl: take imagination for example. it can be visual, or even about an emotion or smell. are those things linguistic or semantic?

[14:11:07] <amigojapan> inhahe_: could it be because language allows us to lie that we can say "a 4 sided triangle"?
[14:12:36] <inhahe_> hmm
[14:12:40] <lckdscl> you can say such a statement but that reveals more about your rationality i suppose
[14:12:49] <lckdscl> since triangle denotes 3 sided shape
[14:13:09] <inhahe_> amigojapan: i'd say it's the other way around. because we can say 'a 4 sided triangle', language allows us to lie
[14:15:46] <inhahe_> i'm not really sure  what to think of this
[14:16:02] <amigojapan> Yeah I'm confused too
[14:16:37] <inhahe_> but my simple intuitive answer is 'no'
[14:17:21] <inhahe_> the ability to lie and the ability to state a contradiction are based in different principles
[14:17:39] <inhahe_> but it's true that you have to be able to lie to state a contradiction, i guess
[14:18:22] <amigojapan> I see
[14:18:29] <inhahe_> so it's necessary to be able to lie to say 'a 4 sided triangle', but it's not the *cause* of being able to say it
[14:18:42] <amigojapan> inhahe_: but am I really lying?
[14:19:02] <inhahe_> maybe not, if it's not part of an assertion
[14:19:16] <inhahe_> or if you're saying 'a 4 sided triangle can't exist'
[14:19:37] <inhahe_> or if you say the words without thinking them
[14:19:46] <inhahe_>  i mean, without thinking about whatyou're saying
[14:20:08] <inhahe_> i guess without knowing what you're saying

[14:25:57] <inhahe_> when you say 'a 4 sided triangle can't exist', the entire assertion isn't a lie, but maybe the one part of it, '4 sided triangle' betrays your thought, which is almost lying in a sense
[14:26:35] <inhahe_> i guess if you're not even imagining a three-sided triangle it's not necessarily betraying your thought
[14:27:57] <inhahe_>  unless saying a phrase that doesn't reflect something you thought is betraying your thought
[14:28:00] <amigojapan> inhahe_: a real lie using logic would be to send people on a quest to find a 4 sided triangle and offer them great rewards when they did it and bring it back
[14:28:31] <inhahe_> well that's a more substantial lie

[14:31:50] <inhahe_> idk
[14:31:50] <amigojapan> I think a higher dimensional triangle would need to have more than 3 sides
[14:32:03] <inhahe_> i think a triangle is 2d by definition
[14:32:10] * Lumine is lost in the Matrix of boredom never to be heard from again
[14:32:11] <inhahe_>  in 3d it would be some kind of polyhedron
[14:32:27] <inhahe_> maybe a pyramid
[14:32:30] <amigojapan> I see
[14:33:53] <amigojapan> inhahe_: yet the prase "maybe a higher dimensional triangle would need to have more than 3 sides"was not a lie
[14:34:17] <amigojapan> Phrase*
[14:35:30] <inhahe_> maybe it was, because the notion of a higher dimensional triangle is a contradiction
[14:35:41] <inhahe_> or maybe it's not a lie, it's just nonsense
[14:36:37] <amigojapan> inhahe_: it caused you to think of a pyramid, so I think it made some sense
[14:36:38] <inhahe_> it's neither true nor false
[14:36:45] <inhahe_>  that's true
[14:36:58] <inhahe_> but it's neither true nor false strictly speaking
[14:37:29] <inhahe_> maybe you could even say it's nonsense strictly speaking
[14:37:34] <inhahe_> and  not nonsense loosely speaking
[14:38:10] <amigojapan> It was a suggestion
[14:38:16] <inhahe_> or analytically speaking verses intuitively
[14:38:33] <inhahe_> yeah i guess it wasn't an assertion
[14:38:49] <amigojapan> Right
[14:39:19] <inhahe_> so it's not a lie because it's not an assertion

[14:45:21] <I_Am_M00t> "a 3-sided triangle with 4-sides"
[14:45:37] <inhahe_> a 3-sided, 4-sided polygon
[14:45:42] <I_Am_M00t> the contradiction is clear from the statement itself, that's the point
[14:46:01] <I_Am_M00t> don't mental gymnastic around this
[14:46:21] <inhahe_> it's not important because there's no such thing as a higher-dimensional triangle anyway
[14:46:28] <I_Am_M00t> otherwise you will not feel the drunken stupor that comes with imagining a 4-sided triangle
[14:46:48] <I_Am_M00t> yeah well, whether not there's a higher dimensional triangle, it's just an escape from the thought experiment
[14:46:58] <inhahe_> but i agree that that strand of thought was a red herring
[14:47:22] <I_Am_M00t> the point is that it's a clearly contradictory statement, and when you try to think about the statement, you get weird mind activity
[14:47:27] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: impossible to even imagine a 4 sided triangle
[14:48:05] <I_Am_M00t> if you start adding ideas like "higher dimensional triangles" to explain how the illogical statement is in fact logical, all you're doing is circumventing the problem

[14:48:25] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: I tried imagining it and when I realized I was really imagining a trapezoid
[14:48:30] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, amigojapan lol
[14:49:43] <I_Am_M00t> it's like slapping someone and say "nothing just happened"
[14:49:59] <I_Am_M00t> "there is no slap"

[14:50:20] <inhahe_> because language isn't thought
[14:50:29] <inhahe_> briefly
[14:50:29] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, hmm
[14:50:39] <I_Am_M00t> language is something other than what we think it is i guess
[14:50:56] <I_Am_M00t> maybe it's a form of tool, it's not... "reality"
[14:50:57] <amigojapan> Language can be illogical
[14:50:58] <inhahe_> what do we think it is?
[14:51:12] <inhahe_> who thinks language is reality~?
[14:51:15] <I_Am_M00t> i think one can imagine language is "truth" or something like that
[14:51:21] <I_Am_M00t> well it happens all the time doesn't it?
[14:51:27] <inhahe_> i guess depending on what you mean
[14:51:27] * pussipupu offers Lumine snow
[14:51:41] <Lumine> Thanks, although lately we've had lots snow
[14:51:42] <I_Am_M00t> we define what reality is through language, and we forget that we used language, and now our definition is the truth
[14:51:49] <inhahe_> our notions of reality can often be based on linguistic propositions
[14:51:50] <I_Am_M00t> idk
[14:52:02] <inhahe_> yeah
[14:52:30] <I_Am_M00t> i mean... that's how society looks to me at least, it's language everywhere, and clearly contradictory statements are everywhere
[14:52:37] <I_Am_M00t> i'm talking about direct contradictions, at the level of logic
[14:53:16] <inhahe_> but, i'm not sure it necessarily follows from 'language can convey something nonsensical, or self-contradictory' to 'language isn't an adequate basis for understanding reality'
[14:53:28] <I_Am_M00t> hmm
[14:53:37] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, maybe you have   a point
[14:53:55] <amigojapan> Could God make a 4 sided triangle, even if he had to change the rules of logic?
[14:54:06] <I_Am_M00t> basically, language is an implementation of logic, roughly speaking
[14:54:13] <I_Am_M00t> and in logic, you can produce false statements
[14:54:25] <I_Am_M00t> if you *couldn't* produce false statements, then logic wouldn't be necessary in first place?
[14:54:30] <amigojapan> Maybe God is illogical
[14:54:56] <I_Am_M00t> like, the point of a logical system is to evaluate statements (true or false)... but if there is no false statement... then why do you even need logic?
[14:55:05] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: yeah, taht goes back to what i was saying earlier: maybe our imagination is neither logical nor illogical, only language can be logical or illogical
[14:55:21] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[14:55:44] <I_Am_M00t> hmm, so maybe "false" statements must exist for logic to exist (i.e. true and false), and similarly, in language false statements must exist, otherwise you cannot have language
[14:56:06] <I_Am_M00t> idk, something like that maybe
[14:56:12] <inhahe_> hm
[14:56:39] <I_Am_M00t> it is fundamentally necessary to be able to express false statements for a language to exist
[14:56:45] <inhahe_> yeah, that's why i was asking amigojapan, what would the world look like and what would be the nature of truth and logic if you couldn't make an illogical statement
[14:56:48] <I_Am_M00t> otherwise it cannot exist... is what i'm thinking
[14:57:00] <inhahe_> yeah, i  think so too
[14:57:15] <I_Am_M00t> in a weird way, maybe the world would exist if you couldn't make illogical statements? lol
[14:57:15] <vysn> I_Am_M00t: as in, there needs to be darkness in order to appreciate the light?
[14:57:27] <I_Am_M00t> urm... i hate to say it, but i guess so
[14:57:29] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: you mean wouldn't? i was thinking that too
[14:57:37] <I_Am_M00t> wouldn't*
[14:58:03] <I_Am_M00t> yes, like... what can you possibly do in a world where everything is... well, not false?
[14:58:15] <I_Am_M00t> i can't even imagine what that would be
[14:58:37] <inhahe_> the world in which language cannot convey something illogical is logically self-contradictory, therefore that world can't exist
[14:58:48] * I_Am_M00t shakes
[14:58:53] <I_Am_M00t> now it's getting mind bendy
[14:59:08] <I_Am_M00t> but without shoving my head up my ass, i think there's something to this
[14:59:31] <vysn> but that's that thing though, you are basing your judgment from what you can imagine, from what you know. and there is surely more to the world than what we know right?
[14:59:38] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: but in such a world we could still say "a 4 dimensional triangle is impossible"so we would mention a 4 dimensional triangle
[14:59:41] <I_Am_M00t> hmm, i don't know vysn
[14:59:51] <I_Am_M00t> I understand your question, but i don't know if it's only my imagination
[14:59:55] <amigojapan> Which is an ilogical object
[15:00:21] <inhahe_> vysn; but you can prove that a 4-sided triangle is impossible
[15:00:28] <inhahe_> so it can't exist out in the world
[15:00:36] <inhahe_> and if it did, you couldn't observe it
[15:01:11] <I_Am_M00t> amigojapan: yes, you can *evaluate* statements. 1+1=2 TRUE, 1+1=3 FALSE.      4-sided triangle = 4-sided 3-sided object  FALSE
[15:01:23] <I_Am_M00t> it's semantics
[15:01:54] <inhahe_> amigojapan: the whole statement is not false, but it still contains a contradiction
[15:02:06] <I_Am_M00t> but the false statements can still exist, and the issue here is, is it even possible to have a logic/language where false statements can't exist?
[15:02:29] <I_Am_M00t> that language would have no words, lol... the evaluation would be an assertion really... TRUE
[15:02:39] <I_Am_M00t> it wouldn't need any input, it would just be TRUE
[15:02:43] <I_Am_M00t> is that even a language? lol
[15:02:44] <amigojapan> inhahe_: so you think you could not state it in a world where we could not say illogical things?
[15:02:47] <inhahe_> what do you mean by input
[15:03:00] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: i mean... the language has no words
[15:03:05] <I_Am_M00t> there are no claims you can make
[15:03:10] <inhahe_> amigojapan: yes, but i think you couldn't state anything in a world in which you could not say illogical things
[15:03:49] <inhahe_> or maybe you couldn't state anything that's either logical or illogical
[15:03:49] <amigojapan> inhahe_: that would make it the same as this world
[15:03:53] <inhahe_> but you could state things that are neither
[15:04:05] <inhahe_> amigojapan: ???
[15:04:10] <I_Am_M00t> for the idea of a "claim" to exist, you must also have the idea of "evaluating" whether a claim is true or false?
[15:04:23] <amigojapan> 8:33 PM <inhahe_> amigojapan: yes, but i think you couldn't state anything in a world in which you could not say illogical things8:33 PM <amigojapan> inhahe_: that would make it the same as this world
[15:04:42] <inhahe_> how is that the same as this world
[15:04:47] <inhahe_> you can state thingts
[15:04:49] <inhahe_> things
[15:04:57] <inhahe_> and you can state illogical things

[15:05:19] <inhahe_> ok
[15:05:29] <I_Am_M00t> whew
[15:06:19] <amigojapan> inhahe_: you say we could not state anything in such a world, but for sure we could state logical things
[15:06:32] <I_Am_M00t>  hmm... how?
[15:06:37] <inhahe_> i don't think so
[15:06:42] <I_Am_M00t> maybe
[15:06:47] <I_Am_M00t> no.. how ? lol
[15:06:58] <amigojapan> Like I could state "a triangle has 3 sides
[15:07:00] <vysn> well. false is the failure to reach the right conclusion. it only exists within us, that which is true exists without even being aware that we are trying to understand it. and based on that, saying that there must false for true to exists sounds like we are projecting our internal reasoning and enforcing it onto all things and all beings.
[15:07:06] <inhahe_> not unless it were because god was actively preventing anyone from stating an illogical thing on a case to case basis
[15:07:12] <I_Am_M00t> amigojapan: but what does such a statement even mean?
[15:07:19] <I_Am_M00t> (in a world where nothing false can be said)
[15:07:48] <I_Am_M00t> amigojapan: let's go with something simpler instead... what does "3" even mean in such a world?
[15:08:00] <inhahe_> vysn: false and true are both within us
[15:08:01] <I_Am_M00t> for "3" to exist, there must be a contrast with "2" or "4" ?
[15:08:04] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: I thought you meant "nothing illogical, not nothing false
[15:08:18] <I_Am_M00t> hmm,
[15:08:24] <I_Am_M00t> what's the difference?
[15:08:34] <inhahe_> false contradicts reality, illogical contradicts itself
[15:09:43] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: I cover what numbers are in my project maths from scratch, but you must understand the source code http://amigojapan.github.io/maths-from-scratch/

[15:09:57] <vysn> with *
[15:10:13] <I_Am_M00t> I guess you could have a language with only true statements. Say you had "1=1" and that was the only thing you could say
[15:10:41] <inhahe_> vysn: then falsities are self-evident too
[15:11:35] <inhahe_> if truth isnt just within us then false isnt
[15:11:42] <I_Am_M00t> i guess you simply have to be careful with how the language is designed, if you had two numbers in that language you could produce a false statement
[15:12:14] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: if there's only one possible thing to say in that language, is it really a language, or just a token/
[15:12:24] <I_Am_M00t> i guess technically it's a language
[15:12:30] <inhahe_> i'm not sure

[15:15:38] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: if you can only say one thing, saying that the language has multiple tokens within it with relationships between the tokens is isomorphic to saying that it's only one token
[15:15:49] <inhahe_> so it's meaningless
[15:16:00] <I_Am_M00t> it's not a useful language, but.. it's still a language maybe
[15:16:12] <I_Am_M00t> {=; 1} that's all the language has
[15:16:32] <I_Am_M00t> {(=,2); 1), two arguments for the equal sign
[15:16:40] <inhahe_> if you can only say one thing, then it can't be grounded in anything to claim that it has individual parts that relate to each other
[15:17:15] <I_Am_M00t> well yes, the only relationship the word "1" has with "1", is that it's itself
[15:17:22] <inhahe_> that statement only seems to make sense because we're evaluating it from the vantage point of a bigger languaghe
[15:17:27] <vysn> inhahe_: I agree, but only based on what we know, what about unkown unkowns? and the common trap of categorical thinking? where one might miss the most logical answer because he is thinking from he is own narrow point of view, or from a single field of expertise
[15:17:45] <I_Am_M00t> well wat, 1=1 makes sense?
[15:17:48] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: there's no relationship
[15:17:54] <I_Am_M00t> there is the "self" relationship? :D
[15:18:30] <I_Am_M00t> i'm sure it's a language of sorts, it's just real crappy
[15:18:40] <I_Am_M00t> it just sits there like a pile of poo
[15:18:41] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: that doesn't have any meaning within that language, that statement only appears to have meaning because it has meaning to our natural language
[15:18:53] <I_Am_M00t> hmm
[15:19:36] <I_Am_M00t> right, maybe the problem is that i chose a bad operation (=)
[15:19:46] <inhahe_> vysn: if you logically prove something, there can be no "logical answer" that contradicts it.
[15:19:50] <I_Am_M00t> that's perhaps not a valid operation
[15:20:02] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: the particular operation is irrelevant
[15:20:09] <I_Am_M00t> well inhahe_ , maybe it's relevant
[15:20:16] <inhahe_> why
[15:20:39] <I_Am_M00t> because it creates confusion with the evaluation
[15:20:58] <I_Am_M00t> maybe that language is invalid in some way
[15:21:04] <inhahe_> but do you understand my reasoning
[15:21:08] <inhahe_> why it's not a language
[15:21:16] <inhahe_> it applies no matter what your symbols are
[15:21:27] <I_Am_M00t> yes, but i think it has to do with the choice of operator and words
[15:21:44] <inhahe_> no
[15:21:46] <I_Am_M00t> hrm...there's something stinky about it
[15:22:09] <I_Am_M00t> well no, there's something happening on the semantic level, that's wrong
[15:22:20] <I_Am_M00t> maybe it ties in with the symbols you choose
[15:22:24] <inhahe_> there's nothing happening at the semantic level
[15:22:31] <I_Am_M00t> there is something wrong, lol
[15:23:39] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: you could claim the individual parts of the token (the one thing you can say in that 'language') mean anything, or have any kind of relationship to each other, and all those things you could say have no way of being any more right than each other
[15:23:51] <inhahe_> they're meaningless
[15:23:58] <I_Am_M00t> 4-sided triangle => 4-sided 3-sided thing =>   4 = 3   FALSE
[15:24:11] <inhahe_> what aboutit
[15:24:39] <Lumine> I'm getting a headache following this
[15:24:44] <I_Am_M00t> 3-sided triangle =>   3-sided 3-sided thing  =>    3 = 3 TRUU
[15:24:49] <inhahe_> what about it
[15:25:43] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: the language comes with semantics tho, so things have "meaning"
[15:25:57] <I_Am_M00t> ("meaning" is then used to evaluate whether statements are true or false)
[15:26:10] <I_Am_M00t> you can of course remove all meaning, lol
[15:26:36] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: the one statement can't be evaluated to be false, so it makes no sense to say it can be evaluated to be true
[15:26:51] <I_Am_M00t> i mean.. you can still evaluate it
[15:27:03] <I_Am_M00t> it is stupid, from our perspective maybe
[15:27:16] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: but do you understand this: [06:53] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: you could claim the individual parts of the token (the one thing you can say in that 'language') mean anything, or have any kind of relationship to each other, and all those things you could say have no way of being any more right than each other
[15:27:16] <inhahe_> [06:53] <inhahe_> they're meaningless
[15:27:55] <inhahe_> i should say 'therefore they're meaningless'
[15:28:49] <I_Am_M00t> commonly we say that "3 = 1+1+1", but you're saying "we can remove the definition of "3" and "1" so they're not linked anymore
[15:28:52] <I_Am_M00t> right?
[15:30:15] <inhahe_> well i'm saying that it makes no difference whether you say that '3=1' is one part of it or three parts of it, or means a number or means oranges
[15:30:31] <inhahe_> no meaningful difference, it's not grounded in anything
[15:30:32] <I_Am_M00t> well, but it makes a difference in the evaluation?
[15:30:33] <I_Am_M00t> :S
[15:31:22] <I_Am_M00t> if "3 = 1" in a meaningless language it'll just be... true, or false, or whatever you want. In a language where you have the "3 > 1" definition the evaluation will always be false
[15:31:24] <inhahe_> if there's no false then there's no true
[15:31:56] <I_Am_M00t> but... you can have false and true, while only having true statements
[15:32:24] <inhahe_> well i'm talking about a language where you can only say one thing
[15:32:28] <inhahe_> so statement, not statements
[15:32:32] <I_Am_M00t> the evaluation can have the "ability" to see false, but the language only has a single word, so no false statements are produced
[15:32:51] <inhahe_> but well, if you can only have true statements by definition, i'm not sure true has the same meaning
[15:33:03] <inhahe_> or any meaning
[15:33:04] <I_Am_M00t> yes, even in the "1=1" language, the evaluation itself can recognize false
[15:33:13] <inhahe_> how?
[15:33:23] <I_Am_M00t> it's just built like that :S
[15:33:28] <inhahe_> only when you evaluate it from the vantage point of regular math
[15:33:44] <inhahe_>  but this language isn't regular math
[15:33:46] <I_Am_M00t> if you later extend the language with another number, you can use the same evaluator to figure out that "1=2" is false
[15:33:57] <inhahe_>  so you can't ground the meaning of its parts in regular math
[15:34:16] <I_Am_M00t> i'm just using numbers to make it simpler, i think it's the same thing for regular languages
[15:34:19] <inhahe_> if you later extend the language with another number, that's a different case
[15:34:37] <I_Am_M00t> well it's the same evaluator tho
[15:34:40] <I_Am_M00t> that's the point i was making
[15:34:41] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: but by 'regular' i mean 'bigger'
[15:34:49] <I_Am_M00t> the evaluator itself recognizes true and false
[15:34:58] <I_Am_M00t> it's just that the language has no false sentences
[15:35:28] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: You realise communication needs certain features for linguists to call it a language right, like recursive syntax, so everything you say is false, absurd, seductive to simple minds and offensive to pious ears, you know right?
[15:35:56] <I_Am_M00t> i disagree Atque
[15:36:08] <inhahe_> i don't think the piraha language of the amazon has recursion
[15:36:16] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Oh, so you reckon the sound of a rock falling is a word in a language?
[15:36:23] <Atque> inhahe_: Yea
[15:36:35] <I_Am_M00t> i still don't see a problem with the "1=1" example,
[15:36:48] <I_Am_M00t> maybe the real issue is with the evaluator itself
[15:37:12] <I_Am_M00t> we want to design an evaluator that doesn't see false, instead of designing a language without false sentences
[15:37:21] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: I do because language is institutional, arbitrary, productive, creative, systematic, vocalic, social, non-instinctive and conventional.
[15:37:32] <I_Am_M00t> that's a surefire way to remove the possibility of false statements
[15:37:45] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: 1=1 is not a fucking language, clearly. So, you are talking nonsense *again*.
[15:38:04] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: if i claim that "1=1" means "apple" in your language, and apples are true, what's the functional difference between how you define it?
[15:38:23] <I_Am_M00t> huh?
[15:38:45] <inhahe_> idk it's hard to explain
[15:39:17] <I_Am_M00t> well for one, "1=1" is a complete statement, i don't know what just saying "apple" is
[15:40:24] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Ironically, tautologies are not statements - they do not make claims about any referents.
[15:41:38] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: what does it mean for 1=1 to be a complete statement, if there's no consequence to me defining it as apple and defining apple as true that's different from how you define it?
[15:41:55] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: maybe let's forget that. I think i know where the problem lies
[15:42:26] <I_Am_M00t> in the definition of the simple "1=1" language, what's not made explicit is a bunch of stuff about logic. And that's where one can intuitively see a problem
[15:42:57] <inhahe_> and you can't express those things about logic in your language
[15:43:00] <I_Am_M00t> like, as soon as you have a language and a way to determine whether sentences are true/false, you have defined true and false
[15:43:11] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: yeah, exactly. They're meta
[15:43:13] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Can you define an apple to be a cat. You can't really have a language where the only statement is 1=1.
[15:43:19] <I_Am_M00t> and that's where the problems arise
[15:43:47] <inhahe_> i think the way i just said the problem, regarding the apple, successfully expresses my issue with it though
[15:43:49] <I_Am_M00t> when you work on the evaluator you have already added a bunch of mechanisms and concepts
[15:43:57] <I_Am_M00t> i don't understand the apple example, lol
[15:44:04] <inhahe_> hmm
[15:44:25] <I_Am_M00t> "1=1" is made of 3 parts, a function "=" and 2 words, "1" and "1"
[15:44:50] <inhahe_> that has no meaning
[15:45:08] <inhahe_> you might as well break it down any possible way
[15:45:13] <inhahe_> the consequence is the same
[15:45:18] <inhahe_> it evaluates to true
[15:45:20] <I_Am_M00t> you define apple as "true", and in the other language "1=1" is evaluated to be true
[15:45:42] <Atque> inhahe_: Equality is a predicate, not a function.
[15:45:49] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: rather
[15:45:55] <inhahe_> there's no difference between saying it evaluates to true from just defining it as true
[15:46:04] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know what you mean by "what is the functional difference". Under the hood, there is a comparison step "="
[15:46:29] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: but the consequence of any way you define the internal parts is the same
[15:46:36] <I_Am_M00t> well, i think there is a slight difference. But on the outside you don't see it, sure
[15:47:00] <I_Am_M00t> if you just concern yourself with inputs and outputs, then of course, all you've done is map sentences to "true" or "false"
[15:47:23] <I_Am_M00t> but if you also define function "=", then something happens under the hood
[15:47:23] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Predicates predicates predicates. Do you know what a predicate is?
[15:47:49] <I_Am_M00t> you can simply create a flat list of strings instead of defining functions though, in which case "1=1" is not three parts, but just one string of 3 characters
[15:48:02] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Maybe, read a book, like a Very Short Introduction to Logic, and then you would know the very basics of logic or do that for philosophy of language.
[15:48:04] <I_Am_M00t> "1=1" is just a word, in that case
[15:48:09] <inhahe_> i think defining "=" to mean something in your language is an illusion. it only seems to make sense because = means something in real math, which is more complex than a single possible statement.
[15:48:10] <I_Am_M00t> similar to "apple"
[15:48:32] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think it's an illusion, it's a function
[15:49:02] <I_Am_M00t> the function "compacts" the words
[15:49:06] <I_Am_M00t> it saves space
[15:49:23] <I_Am_M00t> it's like a compression algorithm
[15:49:31] *** Joins: chomwitt (~chomwitt@athedsl-15695.home.otenet.gr)
[15:49:32] <inhahe_> compacts what words
[15:49:46] <inhahe_> it's irrelevant that you could also express = as 'equals'
[15:50:08] <I_Am_M00t> look, if you were to not define "=" as a function, then the language would need a separate word for every single thing that could be said
[15:50:10] <mycroftiv> in univalent type theory the identity '=' type is very fascinating
[15:50:29] <I_Am_M00t> it's not irrelevant inhahe_, it makes a difference in practice
[15:51:05] <I_Am_M00t> it enables "thinking" to happen
[15:51:17] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: i didn't follow what you mean about a separate word. but you said every single thing that could be said, which doesn't make sense because you can only say one thing
[15:51:34] <I_Am_M00t> bah
[15:52:14] <Atque> mycroftiv: That sounds interesting. What's fascinating about it?
[15:52:25] <I_Am_M00t> what i mean by separate words is that, you would not have sentences any longer
[15:52:36] <I_Am_M00t> you would just have words
[15:53:14] <inhahe_> i don't understanvd
[15:54:14] <inhahe_>  sentences longer than what, and why couldnt they be longer, and how can you say sentences when there is only one sentence
[15:54:16] <I_Am_M00t> if you have the numbers "1,2" and an operator "=", then you get four statements each with 3 words: 1=1, 1=2, 2=1, 2=2. But if i were to remove the meaning from "=", i would instead get four statements each with one word (1=1, 1=2, 2=1, 2=2)
[15:54:27] <mycroftiv> atque: in univalent math, you can say things are '=' if you can construct an equivalence function between them, basically a 1-to-1 matching (bijection)
[15:54:33] <I_Am_M00t> in the former case "1=1" is 3 words, in the latter case "1=1" is a single word, like "apple"
[15:55:24] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: i guess that's true, but it's irrelevant because in your language there's only one statement either way
[15:55:25] <I_Am_M00t> in the former case "1=1" is broken up into "1", "=", "1", in the latter case it's just a single word
[15:55:26] <mycroftiv> atque: so the idea is to capture the idea of identification of isomorphic structures which is common in mathematical practice, even though this will prove some quite different things are equal/can be identified
[15:55:33] <I_Am_M00t> it's not irrelevant tho
[15:55:45] <I_Am_M00t> because in the evaluation step different things happen
[15:55:53] <inhahe_> only one thing can happen
[15:55:58] <I_Am_M00t> no, different things happen
[15:56:26] <inhahe_> what do you mean by different things
[15:56:28] <I_Am_M00t> in the former case "1=1" is calculated, and "1" is correctly mapped to "1"
[15:56:40] <I_Am_M00t> in the latter case "1=1" is directly mapped to "true"
[15:56:54] <I_Am_M00t> because it's just a word
[15:57:15] <inhahe_> but if there can be only one result of the calculation, how you do the calculation is irrelevant
[15:57:22] <inhahe_> it's superfluous
[15:57:42] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: whether extensional equivalence is used for equality or not is up to the formal system
[15:57:48] <I_Am_M00t> well, that's what i was hinting at before... the irrelevant can only be seen if you look at the meta
[15:57:55] <I_Am_M00t> within the language itself it's perfectly relevant
[15:58:11] <mycroftiv> some systems actually dont have extensional equivalence and the different ways of calculating the same value are not considered equivalent
[15:59:25] <mycroftiv> in standard mathematics we do have function extensionality, but we can make our concept of equality intensional instead and say we care about how the outputs are constructed, not just what the outputs are
[15:59:59] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: i think if in a language you can only have one possible sentence, it makes no difference how you break up the parts of that sentence and how you say the parts relate to each other, because there can be no different consequences, so each possible way is equally right or wrong, and hence meaningless. what do you say about that?
[16:00:04] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: either way, i think the problem here lies in the evaluation function itself, in the things that have been unsaid, that are defined as soon as you talk about logic, and the idea of truths and falsehoods. The problem is not with the langauge
[16:00:52] <I_Am_M00t> it does make a different inhahe_
[16:00:54] <Atque> mycroftiv: Yes, that's interesting, but hard to conceptualise certain equalities like that, such as for irrational numbers.
[16:01:00] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: i think i cant connect the mathematical type theory directly to language and grammar and meaning, i was giving some related mathematical ideas, not really taking a view on the topic, im actually still catching up
[16:01:58] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: if the evaluation is just a process that can't happen any other way, there's no point in evaluating.
[16:02:10] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: so what? lol
[16:02:13] <mycroftiv> just wanted to toss out some info on how even in mathematics, equality and identification can work in several different ways
[16:02:13] <I_Am_M00t> we're just going in circles
[16:02:16] <I_Am_M00t> the problem lies in the meta
[16:02:19] <I_Am_M00t> not in the language
[16:02:36] <I_Am_M00t> there is nothing invalid about the language itself
[16:02:44] <I_Am_M00t> it can exist
[16:02:54] <I_Am_M00t> it's just really shitty
[16:02:54] <inhahe_> well the evaluation itself has about as much substance as mental masturbation
[16:03:03] <I_Am_M00t> not really, no
[16:03:18] <I_Am_M00t> it's just dumb
[16:03:35] <Atque> inhahe_: Tautologies only really have meaning in propositional logic. Clearly, you aren't making any claims about referents saying apples are apples, bananas are bananas, Xs are Xs, etc.
[16:04:51] <inhahe_> i wasn't saying apples are apples, but saying the whole thing was just apple. the idea is that it makes no difference how you define the individual parts or separatet hem.
[16:04:53] <inhahe_> them.
[16:05:18] <I_Am_M00t> you can get the same results both ways
[16:05:25] <inhahe_> the whole language is functionaly equivalent to a single token
[16:05:33] <I_Am_M00t> yes
[16:05:41] <I_Am_M00t> a single word
[16:05:49] <I_Am_M00t> mapped to "true" or "false"
[16:06:09] <inhahe_>  and a single token  doesn't constitute a language
[16:06:29] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know what to say, you can create a language like that, lol
[16:06:38] <I_Am_M00t> it's just useless
[16:06:46] <inhahe_> "chair" can't be a language
[16:07:30] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, i'm gonna say this for the third time, and them i don't know if i wanna continue. The problem is something meta, not about the language itself
[16:07:33] <I_Am_M00t> then*
[16:07:36] <inhahe_> ok

[16:13:38] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but it's possible to do
[16:13:43] <inhahe_> well, such a metaphysical claim has no meaning
[16:13:50] <I_Am_M00t> i guess not, no :S
[16:13:51] <inhahe_> just like 1=1

[16:14:02] <I_Am_M00t> yes, it's a useless language
[16:14:15] <inhahe_> it's not a language
[16:14:19] <I_Am_M00t> well, it is
[16:14:32] <I_Am_M00t> :D
[16:14:37] <inhahe_> :P
[16:15:20] <I_Am_M00t> it breaks a purpose of sorts, that logic is meant to have
[16:15:24] <I_Am_M00t> that's what i think
[16:15:42] <I_Am_M00t> that's what makes it dumb
[16:15:57] <inhahe_> that's a weaker take on the basic problem withit
[16:16:09] <I_Am_M00t> well no, i think you have to investigate "meta" things
[16:16:15] <I_Am_M00t> otherwise the discussion can't go on
[16:16:23] <inhahe_> what meta things
[16:16:31] <I_Am_M00t> the evaluator itself
[16:16:33] <I_Am_M00t> how it works
[16:16:44] <I_Am_M00t> the process of checking whether statements are true or false
[16:17:00] <inhahe_> those are all details
[16:17:14] <inhahe_> incidental
[16:17:27] <I_Am_M00t> not so sure it's all incidental
[16:17:33] <I_Am_M00t> there may be something universal to it
[16:18:21] <inhahe_> well, they're incidental to my issue with itanyway ;)
[16:18:26] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think they are
[16:18:31] <I_Am_M00t> i think that's where the real issue is highlighted

[17:42:09] <amigojapan> inhahe_: you mention ‚Äúthe cheese is in my pocket‚Äù is true if and only if the cheese is in my pocket. The problem with that formulation is that it‚Äôs essentially just a tautology. But I don't believe it is a tautology. The first sentence is a truth statement, and the second statement is a comment of a phisical phenomenon. Namely that there is someone actually holding cheese inside his pocket
[17:42:33] <amigojapan> It may sound like a tautology but it is not
[17:43:34] <amigojapan> inhahe_: I could say "I am drinking seltzer, and it would be true cause I am, but it w would be false if I was drinking coffee
[17:45:54] <amigojapan> inhahe_: so I think a true statement is a description of something that is actually happening. Well there can be true statements about fantasy too but let's not get into that now

[17:48:05] <inhahe_> amigojapan: but i go on to say that the problem is that they're both propositions and reality isn't propositional
[17:50:08] <amigojapan> inhahe_: what if you are observing me and I put cheese inside my pocket. And you see that, and then I say "I have cheese in my pocket". Then it would be a true statement that your witnessed
[17:51:34] <inhahe_> amigojapan: in your hypothetical, you're giving me a proposition and then repeatingh it
[17:51:58] <inhahe_> amigojapan: in reality, whatever the state of affairs is, it's not propositional
[17:52:07] <inhahe_> and doesn't have a narrator
[17:52:12] <inhahe_> that's omniscient
[17:52:18] <amigojapan> No, you would be observing my actions. Not listening to a proposition
[17:52:19] <inhahe_> as a hypothetical does
[17:53:10] <inhahe_> you're presenting the hypothetical in propositional form
[17:53:13] <amigojapan> inhahe_: what if I write "we are chatting", that is a true statement
[17:53:26] <amigojapan> This is not hypothetical
[17:54:01] <inhahe_> amigojapan: okay, but whatever " we are chatting" corresponds to in objective reality is not propositional, so it's not the fact that "we are chatting"
[17:54:16] <inhahe_> "we are chatting" is a proposition
[17:54:37] <amigojapan> But both you and me know it's true
[17:54:50] <inhahe_> so
[17:55:08] <inhahe_> truth does tend to be agreed upond
[17:55:18] <inhahe_> doesn't mean correspondence theory of truth makes any sense
[17:55:27] <inhahe_> at least as formulated in my essay
[17:55:34] <inhahe_> which is how i've seen it
[17:55:39] <amigojapan> No it's not an agreement it is obvious cause the truth is based on our actions
[17:56:15] <inhahe_> that's why it's in agreement
[17:57:06] <inhahe_> but whatever 'our actions' really are, they're not propositional in nature
[17:57:15] <amigojapan> Ok inhahe_ I would like to continue this chat tomorrow, going to sleep now
[17:57:19] <inhahe_> ok later
[17:57:32] <amigojapan> Ty
[17:58:10] <mycroftiv> tarski formal model-theoretic definition of truth in logic is nice, as to how to think of truth in reality, i feel like a lot of partially overlapping definitions are inevitable
