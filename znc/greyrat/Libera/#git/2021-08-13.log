[00:08:23] <ash_worksi> ikke: they're basically all different

[00:10:00] <ash_worksi> so, it denied me because I'm in the middle of a merge

[00:11:15] <ash_worksi> I mean, I don't know what else to do about the conflicts

[00:12:07] <ash_worksi> I don't want those files all under one commit (they were apparently previously staged)
[00:12:09] <imMute> you should commit merge conflict fixes as part of the merge commit, not separate commits.
[00:12:18] <ikke> It does not make sense to merge, run into conflicts, and then commit each file separately
[00:13:00] <ash_worksi> ikke: I mean, I did `git add A B C; "oh wait"; `git pull`; *conflicts*`
[00:13:14] <j416> you should not commit merge conflicts

[00:33:45] <ghostbuster> is there a way to do the following in a cleaner way? git log --oneline -- some/sub/dir | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}'
[00:33:57] <ghostbuster> ie. i want to obtain the hash of the latest commit that touched a subdir of the repo
[00:34:19] <ghostbuster> i'm guessing there's an incantation of git rev-parse that will do it but i have not had much luck understanding the man page
[00:34:50] <ikke> git rev-list --format="%H" -- some/sub/dir
[00:35:09] <ghostbuster> thank you :)
[00:35:48] <ghostbuster> hmm git rev-list is saying it requires a commit-id
[00:35:55] <ikke> --all
[00:36:04] <ikke> or HEAD

[13:12:03] <canton7> TJ-, It could be an !evil_merge ?
[13:12:03] <gitinfo> TJ-: What you describe _can_ be done, but results in an "evil merge": a commit that purports to be a merge, but does not actually take all changes from all sides. This violates the assumptions that tools and humans make about merges, and usually results in confusion and pain down the road.
[13:12:12] *** Joins: mci64 (~mci64@185.242.190.95)
[13:12:18] <canton7> Eh, that trigger isn't helpful here
[13:12:43] <canton7> An evil merge is one where the merge commit itself contains changes which aren't present in either of the things being merged together (e.g. a conflict resolution which does more than it should)
[13:12:45] <TJ-> canton7: thanks ! hmmmph
[13:12:54] <canton7> Git's tooling isn't particularly good at picking up changes which were introduced in evil merges
[13:13:11] <canton7> ... I'm not saying that's definitely your problem, but if the tooling isn't being helpful, and a merge is in the middle of it all, it's worth considering
[13:13:16] <TJ-> I think I'll resort to just saying "it was deleted between v5 and v6!"
[13:13:51] <canton7> TJ-, If the "Commit ID is a merge", then look at each parent of the merge, see if it's there. If it's in both parents, but isn't in the tree attached to the merge itself, you've got yourself an evil merge

[15:48:59] <jokoon> well it didn't ask for any password, and I never typed it, I think I messed up something :S
[15:49:12] <j416> jokoon: perhaps you didn't set a password on your key (which you should)
[15:49:31] <jokoon> j416, I set a password for my key pair with ssh-keygen
[15:49:51] <j416> in that case, you probably have ssh-agent running by default and it slurped that up for you
[15:49:53] <osse> did you fetch/push ?

[15:50:45] <osse> what does 'git remote -v' print
[15:50:47] <lalitmee> j416: I was trying to use git-worktree in a react project by creating a bare repo but when ever I create a worktree with a branch I need to install node_modules manually and copy some untracked git files which we are not tracking in git for security reasons. Is this the right flow or I am missing something?
[15:50:47] <jokoon> it slurped, meaning saved the password?

[15:51:45] <jokoon> so thatm ust be done in the github website UI?
[15:51:46] <j416> lalitmee: although most of the time you'd have a regular repo, and create an additional worktree from that if needed

[15:51:59] <j416> thanks
[15:52:05] <osse> that was for jokoon oops
[15:52:57] <j416> that makess more sense @ remote url
[15:53:00] <jokoon> so that's another command I must run for every client push/pulling ?
[15:53:13] <lalitmee> j416: do you mean that I should use a non-bare repo and then create worktree from that and then I will not have to install node_modules manually?
[15:53:15] <jokoon> I mean for configuration
[15:53:19] <j416> I haven't encountered a situation where ssh-agent got the key directly on creation; password needed at least once
[15:53:20] <osse> jokoon: for each repo yes
[15:53:37] <j416> lalitmee: yes to the first part. I don't know anything about node_modules.
[15:54:21] <jokoon> github also talks about tokens... that's weird
[15:54:26] <lalitmee> j416: actually node_modules also you can suppose untracked files which are not being tracked in git
[15:54:42] <j416> lalitmee: I don't understand what that means.

[17:20:23] <dzho> I haven't used gitolite in a long time, and gitweb only on the client side so I'm just trying to think through this with you. There are two things that come to mind.
[17:20:55] <dzho> one is to make the directory levels of control different: Tell gitolite to manage a level higher up, but point gitweb to a subdirectory of what gitolite manages.
[17:21:19] <dzho> two is via authorization: Do not give the gitweb user access to the gitolite admin repo
[17:22:59] <dzho> this is all out of a defense-in-depth kind of consideration.
[17:23:43] <dzho> you may not want to expose the membership of gitolite access groups, but so far as I can think off the top of my head there aren't passwords or private keys necessarily in there anywhere

[17:25:23] <dzho> also, are you using any instructions you've found to make gitolite and gitweb work together? I've found a few from searches but don't want to complicate things by posting links that may be less relevant.

[19:37:59] <BtbN> What does git status report?
[19:37:59] <selckin> stashing would store the uncomitted changes in the stash/tmp branch thing
[19:38:17] <selckin> so then it can swap the branch, without you'll have to resolve the conflicts

[19:45:06] <selckin> !backup
[19:45:06] <gitinfo> Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup. See also http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitBestPractices/#backups
[19:45:07] <teut> ok the usual reset
[19:45:10] <selckin> !reflog
[19:45:10] <gitinfo> The git reflog (`git log -g`) temporarily (90 days by default) snapshots your branch states at each operation that changes the branch, making it easy to undo e.g. merges and rebases. The usual warnings about !rewriting/undoing history apply. See https://sukima.github.io/GitFixUm/ for full details.

[20:26:50] <lpapp> hi, I have a MR with multiple commits
[20:27:00] <lpapp> I accidentally did git rebase -i HEAD~7 which goes beyond just my commits
[20:27:12] <lpapp> which means some commit got a new hash in my branch from main without changing anything
[20:27:18] <lpapp> this will cause issues for me MR
[20:27:26] <lpapp> how can I revert that commit back to its original hash?

[20:28:06] <lpapp> I can always do git format-patch, recreate the branch, reapply the changes
[20:28:10] <lpapp> but was wondering if there is a simpler way
[20:28:57] <imMute> lpapp: did you actually change those early commits during the rebase?  if not, they'll have the same hash
[20:29:04] <lpapp> no, I have not
[20:29:15] <lpapp> but after rebase --continue and force push to the gitlab mr
[20:29:18] <lpapp> I got them appear in my MR
[20:29:26] <lpapp> I should not really.
[20:31:27] *** Joins: dviola (~diego@user/dviola)
[20:31:33] <imMute> if you didn't change them then the sha shouldn't change, and if those commits were part of main (what your MR is going to merge into) then the MR shouldn't pick them up.
[20:33:17] <lpapp> it is not true
[20:33:21] <lpapp> even if you do not do anything
[20:33:26] <lpapp> just do git rebase -i HEAD~X
[20:33:30] <lpapp> you press write, and quit
[20:33:36] <lpapp> all the changes will change hashes
[20:33:41] <lpapp> even though you have literally done nothing
[20:33:46] <lpapp> or at least, that is how it works on my machine
[20:34:16] <imMute> it shouldn't do that.  since you're not actually changing the base it should reuse commits.
[20:34:36] *** Joins: va5c0 (~vasco.nun@95.148.139.46)
[20:34:41] <imMute> unless one of the commits in between was a merge commit that has commits not in HEAD~X,  then it'll have to change commits and those will get new hashes
[20:35:05] <lpapp> yes, every MR gets a merge commit for sure
[20:35:28] <lpapp> I most likely removed a merge commit with my rebase like that
[20:35:35] <imMute> either way, the reflog will have the SHA of what your branch was before the mistaken rebase.  you can reset to that to fix your branch and redo the rebase
[20:36:00] <imMute> okay, so it *did* change commits in the history (removed merge commits and brough in the branch's commits into the linear history)

[21:04:16] <joo> what kind of workarounds are the most commonly used to switch between sessions fast? i just got a function called m that calls something like screen -x $(screen -ls|fzf) but switching still requires some keystrokes
[21:04:41] <thiago> wrong channel?
[21:05:15] <joo> hehe i am sorry
[21:05:18] <mackerman>  Try #screen or the channel of your shell of choice
[21:05:32] <thiago> should we recommend tmux? :)
[21:05:34] <joo> it was actually meant for #screen
[21:05:46] <j416> yes, and switch to tmux already
[21:05:48] * j416 runs
[21:05:50] <joo> dont say tmux :D that is unholy
[21:05:56] <j416> you just said it
[21:06:03] <joo> the master is using screen only
[21:07:10] <j416> send a patch to fix it
[21:07:19] <imMute> which one recently had a pretty big security vulnerability?
[21:07:51] <joo> those things are irrelevant, if you put a computer online you are asking for it anyway
[21:08:24] <joo> its not like you can "just switch" a terminal multiplexer anyway
[21:08:35] <joo> that will take many years of intense training
[21:08:57] <imMute> lol.  I "just switched" a couple months ago.  wasn't hard at all
[21:08:58] <j416> without food
[21:09:11] <Nomikos> I use both and often nest them, it's alright
[21:09:16] <j416> beaten with a stick
[21:09:19] <joo> sounds good, can You train me ? :D
[21:09:22] <joo> I will pay
[21:09:48] <joo> jacket-off, jacket on
[21:09:54] <Nomikos> just google for cheatsheets and make a config that suits you for yourself
[21:10:14] <imMute> doin a real good job of representing the FSF there, joo
[21:10:26] <Nomikos> I prefer tmux tbh, but I need that on the host, and if then also run it on the remote it'll get too confusing
[21:10:39] <Nomikos> so that keep running screen
[21:10:50] <joo> imMute, point taken, i will man up , - i am not fsf member though, just supporter
[21:11:52] <joo> maybe the reason it is not fixed is because so many people have switched to tmux, could perhaps be the future then
