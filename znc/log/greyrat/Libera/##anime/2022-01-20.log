[02:04:58] <JesseDesu> i have
[02:05:07] <JesseDesu> anki doesnt advance automatically
[02:05:09] <JesseDesu> which i dont like
[02:05:17] <JesseDesu> you have to rank your answer which i dont like
[02:05:22] <TsundereNoises> what do you mean? like that you have to click pass or fail?
[02:05:26] <TsundereNoises> ah
[02:05:46] <TsundereNoises> fair I guess, that's the whole crux of how it's intended to work, so it's kind of central
[02:05:52] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[02:05:55] <JesseDesu> yea i dont like it
[02:06:07] <JesseDesu> i used it for a bit but was never into it cuz of that
[02:06:24] <TsundereNoises> because you feel like you cheat, or what?
[02:06:27] <JesseDesu> i remember triviabot would continue regardless of anyone not answering
[02:06:40] <TsundereNoises> oh, I feel like that would frustrate the hell of out me
[02:06:41] <JesseDesu> i just want to in put answers one after another
[02:07:05] <JesseDesu> i did end up memorizing a lot
[02:07:12] <JesseDesu> i used it for chemistry and history
[02:07:23] <JesseDesu> i got As cuz of it
[02:07:35] <JesseDesu> ok maybe not chem
[02:07:41] <JesseDesu> i forget exactly what the grade was
[02:07:56] <TsundereNoises> I feel like one of the biggest problems with online "how best to learn X" discussions is that fundamentally if you put in enough hours decently trying to learn, whatever will work, everything else is details
[02:08:01] <JesseDesu> i aced us history 1 and 2
[02:08:06] <TsundereNoises> and the most important thing is doing something that you can actually stick with and not hate
[02:08:20] <JesseDesu> flashcards always work
[02:08:22] <TsundereNoises> but people get too caught up in "MY way is more efficient
[02:08:23] <JesseDesu> real ones
[02:08:29] <TsundereNoises> that said, my way is best, obviously
[02:08:41] <monarch-k0k1> my brain deflated
[02:08:42] <JesseDesu> last time i made flashcards was for hiragana
[02:09:04] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I've always liked physical flashcards
[02:09:07] <TsundereNoises> easier to use on the toilet
[02:09:11] <JesseDesu> i still get tripped up on i and ri
[02:09:23] <TsundereNoises> I'm somewhat joking, but not really, toilet is a time where you're stuck in place, easy to study
[02:09:29] <JesseDesu> shi and n
[02:09:36] <JesseDesu> for katakana
[02:09:53] <JesseDesu> when i'm on the toilet i study instagram
[02:10:20] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: trick for them is think about the stroke direction of the hiragana: „Åó„ÄÄ„Ç∑„ÄÄ„Å§„ÄÄ„ÉÑ„ÄÄ„Çì„ÄÄ„É≥„ÄÄ„Åù„ÄÄ„ÇΩ
[02:10:38] <TsundereNoises> the little hash mark kind of strokes are the first part of the same stroke, basically
[02:10:48] <TsundereNoises> not sure I can explain by text, but it's a nice way to remember
[02:11:13] <JesseDesu> i think its shi ? tsu ? n ? so and something
[02:11:27] <TsundereNoises> yeah shi shi, tsu tsu, n, n, so, so
[02:11:35] <TsundereNoises> I was putting them there for comparison so you could see what I meant
[02:11:40] <JesseDesu> oh ok
[02:11:41] <JesseDesu> ty
[02:11:45] <JesseDesu> i should screenshot that
[02:12:02] <TsundereNoises> like the shi starts with a down stroke, then up, the first 2 hash mark kind of strokes on the katakana shi are that down stroke basically
[02:12:09] <TsundereNoises> and then the long one is more horizontal
[02:12:20] <TsundereNoises> I'll make it prettier, hold on
[02:12:58] <JesseDesu> what about i and ri
[02:13:17] <TsundereNoises> „Åó „Ç∑„ÄÄ„Å§ „ÉÑ„ÄÄ„Çì „É≥„ÄÄ„Åù „ÇΩ
[02:14:00] <JesseDesu> ty
[02:14:05] <TsundereNoises> I never really confused them, so I don't have a pre-existing trick, but „ÅÑ vs. „Çä are obvious in computer fonts, in handwriting it's more about the angle
[02:14:13] <TsundereNoises> sorry, trying to think up a good tip there
[02:14:27] <monarch-k0k1> l o a d i n g . . .
[02:14:47] <JesseDesu> yea it looks clear on computer
[02:15:13] <JesseDesu> anyway
[02:15:15] <TsundereNoises> so when you handwrite them, basically the pen moves over the spot the computer attaches the ri together, but you pick the pen up (or some people do)
[02:15:22] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, sorry, don't have a good trick there
[02:15:23] <JesseDesu> i wanted to make a trivia bot for this
[02:15:28] <JesseDesu> utterly failed
[02:15:40] <JesseDesu> like a stand alone app 
[02:16:01] <JesseDesu> i was looking into frameworks and all this and just got utterly confused
[02:16:16] <JesseDesu> i thought i could learn cocoa
[02:16:20] <JesseDesu> for mac
[02:16:24] <Fenderbassist> sounds like a lot to take in and try to understand, in a short amount of time
[02:17:09] <Fenderbassist> I imagine developing an app or a bot takes time
[02:17:26] <JesseDesu> yea no kidding
[02:17:35] <JesseDesu> i have ideas but cant execute them
[02:17:44] <Fenderbassist> I'm sure you could given enough time
[02:17:47] <JesseDesu> no code or low code sounds interesting
[02:18:14] <Fenderbassist> you couldn't make that jet model complete in a day, but you can make it complete in the proper amount of time
[02:18:22] <Fenderbassist> same thing with coding, I'm sure
[02:18:48] <Fenderbassist> the way I see it, you didn't fail at anything, you just haven't gotten started yet :)

[10:57:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Is the Quest the headest by the evilcorp one?
[10:57:47] <Bco1981> yes
[10:58:41] <Bco1981> but the people out there don't seem to mind, as of dec 2021 the quest 2 is up to 39% of headsets on steam.
[10:59:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm more likely to get a second-hand headset of less dubious origins instead.
[11:00:12] <Bco1981> the problem is what you get for the price, the quest 2 really can't be matched.
[11:00:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's subsidized by the data theft & sale
[11:01:25] <Bco1981> true, but people complain about the price of vr in general, and at the same time many don't like it because it's now facebook.
[11:02:11] <Bco1981> if you want what the quest 2 offers, but don't want to contribute to facebook. then you are gonna pay more. but like i said, then people complain about the price.

[11:23:00] <Bco1981> not sure, he does look a little pale and low on energy. but not really a fever.
[11:23:58] <HubertFarnsworth> could it be anemic?
[11:25:07] <HubertFarnsworth> the government has declared holidays for schools here because of increasing covid cases 
[11:25:19] <Bco1981> not sure, but he started on a higher dose of medicine, i'm suspecting it is a reaction to that.

[16:16:10] <DunceCotus> xD
[16:16:39] <DunceCotus> these are paradoxical forms, or perhaps even "The Forms" of Plato
[16:16:48] <DunceCotus> its not possible to represent them
[16:16:58] <DunceCotus> except very loosely/vaguely through language
[16:17:54] <DunceCotus> there's probably other metaphysical reasons why we can conceptualise in language the notion of 4 sided triangle but can't represent it 
[16:18:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: yet you can draw a triangle, why can't you draw me what you saw in your trip?
[16:18:27] <DunceCotus> probably related to limits of conscious cognition, which is related to the limit of plane of organisation

[16:26:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: on one trip I actually witnessed people and objects turning into paradoxical forms 
[16:26:52] <DunceCotus> or rather 'primordial' forms
[16:27:01] <DunceCotus> like I was peering into their very desires
[16:27:08] <DunceCotus> and it took the form of particular shapes
[16:27:18] <DunceCotus> strange paradoxical objects
[16:28:07] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so yeah, it can be confronting when experienced, gotta keep your head (and this can cause bad trips)
[16:29:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: a woman might turn into a chimera of stockings, shoes, lipstick, flowers etc.

[16:29:40] <DunceCotus> as though there's a substrate of reality that is normally inaccessible where all these desired things are assembled into forms
[16:30:21] <DunceCotus> and its not just objects either, but odours, feelings
[16:30:23] <DunceCotus> affects
[16:31:54] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus 
[16:32:07] <DunceCotus> if you don't roll with it the brain tries to bring you back to consensus reality, though isn't always successful and this can produce a sort of loop of trying to get to sanity, failing, trying again etc.
[16:32:41] <DunceCotus> until the drug wears off
[16:32:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: why do you think the law of non contradiction seems to rule over this universe, in everything but language?
[16:33:14] <DunceCotus> nobody ever died of contradictions!
[16:33:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this universe has a particular organisation that resists certain contradictory relations
[16:33:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: like I can't be in Japan and in Australia at the same time
[16:34:23] <amigojapan> Maybe in a dream
[16:34:35] <DunceCotus> in a dream you can
[16:34:54] <amigojapan> Ok
[16:34:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its cause of an accretion of organisation called strata
[16:35:23] <DunceCotus> whereby geology has spatio-temporal qualities that prevent overlaps like that
[16:35:33] <DunceCotus> but our dreams criss-cross the strata so they aren't limited in the same way
[16:36:35] <amigojapan> I see
[16:36:44] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I mean countries are just what we label certain areas or territories on the geological strata
[16:37:20] <DunceCotus> the strata is a striation of zones of intensity
[16:38:22] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: you can be in australian embassy in japan
[16:38:52] <DunceCotus> in a dream it may make perfect sense to be in Australia-Japan
[16:39:13] <DunceCotus> only in ordinary waking reality is that a problem
[16:39:48] <DunceCotus> but I am not sure that's cause its a contradiction
[16:39:59] <DunceCotus> I think real contradictions can and do exist
[16:40:04] <DunceCotus> though it is often perspectival
[16:40:35] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: well that is a legal thing. Usually you are considered to be in the country of the embassy when you are in it

[19:52:47] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I say that, again, as someone who loves horror
[19:52:49] <MootPoot> we have like 5 good ones
[19:52:58] <DandereNoises> horror can be done well, but anime in particular always fucks it up
[19:53:05] <MootPoot> Sadale: noooooooooooooooooo
[19:53:17] <MootPoot> sometimes I wish I had Sadale's ability to sleep on a scedule
[19:53:22] <DandereNoises> I think part of the problem is people writing horror anime are either teenagers, or don't like horror themselves and just want to appeal to edgy teenagers
[19:53:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, I've only got like 8 hours of sleep every day. I really need 9 hours :(

[19:56:12] <MootPoot> takes me 2 hours to go to sleep
[19:56:18] <MootPoot> then I'll wake up in 5 hours
[19:56:36] <DandereNoises> I basically go until I'm falling down, then I sleep, wake up 5 hours later
[19:56:39] <MootPoot> if I go back to sleep after that then I'll sleep for like 12h straight
[19:56:43] <DandereNoises> and then once in a while I'm falling down tired earlier

[19:57:29] <DandereNoises> not only are there a ton of actually good magical girl shows, I also think there are good examples of literally every genre, if people would just give them a chance
[19:57:48] <DandereNoises> but sports, magical girls, and idols people who like shoenen are really happy to stereotype themselves out of ever giving a fair chance
[19:57:56] <DandereNoises> I DO watch CGDCT
[19:57:58] <DandereNoises> obviously
[19:57:59] <MootPoot> One time a dude on discord made me watch a whole episode of bang dream
[19:58:07] <DandereNoises> but magical girls don't make it worse, they give it a plot
[19:58:08] <MootPoot> god
[19:58:10] <MootPoot> it was terrible

[19:58:22] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: the first episode of Bang Dream is just a k-on rehash
[19:58:26] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: I mean magical girl plots are as thick as hentai plot
[19:58:40] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: it depends on the show, but you're pretty wrong in a lot of cases
[19:58:45] <MootPoot> no u
[19:58:56] <DandereNoises> hell, even a lot of the made-for-kids magical girls have a surprising amount of plot
[19:59:15] <MootPoot> The few magical girl shows I have wasted my time on largely lost me within the first ep
[19:59:20] <MootPoot> I'll unironically say this
[19:59:35] <MootPoot> I'd rather watch shojo anime then magical girl
[19:59:37] <DandereNoises> I mean you obviously aren't willing to give things a chance when they go against your pre-existing biases

[20:00:41] <MootPoot> >I mean you obviously aren't willing to give things a chance when they go against your pre-existing biases
[20:00:47] <MootPoot> really?
[20:00:57] <DandereNoises> I'm more objecting to the dismissal of wide and varied genres based on you not having really seen anything (or anything particularly good)
[20:01:04] <DandereNoises> I don't like Shounen, but there are some shounen anime I like

[20:03:07] <MootPoot> not anything somebody else told me
[20:03:40] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I'm glad you've liked a few shoujo, that's my point. And no, I wouldn't have thought that after "ugh, I'd rather watch shoujo anime" i.e. a think you just said
[20:03:51] <DandereNoises> Guest30: just a sec

[20:04:12] <Guest30> DandereNoises No problem.
[20:04:14] <charlietheloser> oh, lol
[20:04:40] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: not that, stuff like "magical girl shows have plots as thin as hentai"
[20:04:47] <charlietheloser> am I like the only damn minor here?
[20:04:54] <MootPoot> yes, that is based off of my experiences with the genre
[20:05:01] <MootPoot> not something somebody else told me
[20:05:03] <Guest30> I don't really think it's a 'weeb' fight. People are free and should be able to share their personal opinion towards things they are passionate about.
[20:05:10] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I don't really care if you don't like something, although I wish I could recommend you something in a few different genres
[20:05:11] <MootPoot> WEEB FIGHT
[20:05:35] <MootPoot> I mean, nothing is stopping you from recommending anything
[20:05:46] <MootPoot> I'll try 1-2 eps of literally anything I come across
[20:05:50] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I just mind you dissing whole giant swathes of things that you haven't seen much of (and yes, I think seeing first episodes of a few random shows you're predisposed to dislike doesn't count as talking about things you know about)
[20:05:51] <charlietheloser> oh hentai plots are shit
[20:05:58] <DandereNoises> OTHER than as relates to your own taste
[20:06:06] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: why do you think I'm predisposed to dislike it?
[20:06:15] <MootPoot> bit of an assumption
[20:06:20] <Guest30> charlietheloser your prior statement about you being a minor sort of clashes with your recent one.
[20:06:25] <DandereNoises> Guest30: any argument between me and MootPoot is, BY DEFINITION a weeb fight

[20:07:27] <MootPoot> but ok
[20:07:30] <DandereNoises> I feel like this is about to turn into a semantics argument about the word assumption
[20:07:35] <DandereNoises> so I kind of want to say never mind
[20:07:44] <charlietheloser> i mean, I am a minor and i watch hentai
[20:07:52] <MootPoot> you keep on inferring my rationale and thoughts
[20:07:54] <MootPoot> for some reason
[20:07:58] <MootPoot> and I dont understand why
[20:07:59] <Guest30> People are entitled to their opinions though I find that to be sort of a thing that is very difficult to respect due to the nature of the internet. Information spreads quick.
[20:08:08] * MootPoot puts Guest30 in a corner
[20:08:08] <MootPoot> sit
[20:08:09] <DandereNoises> cause really I just want you to acknowledge that if you've seen episode 1 of a 50 episode show, you know fuck all about what the plot of the show is
[20:08:27] <Guest30> MootPoot Why?
[20:08:33] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: because communication isn't possible if you don't try to infer the meaning behind the words the other person is saying?
[20:08:45] <MootPoot> no, you can just read what I'm typing
[20:09:10] <DandereNoises> yes but I need to obtain meaning from your sentences, which seems like what you're having a problem with
[20:09:49] <DandereNoises> I really don't think I'm making big crazy assumptions, other than my admittedly jerkish comment about whatever it was earlier
[20:09:51] <MootPoot> meaning from my sentances is from my sentances
[20:09:54] <DandereNoises> I think I did do that, but like once
[20:10:04] <Guest30> This sort of thing is like what couples do sometimes. Vaguely hint at something instead of just blatantly stating the issue.
[20:10:12] <MootPoot> Guest30: sit
[20:10:14] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: on the other hand, I think thinking you know what the plot of a show is by episode 1 is bs

[20:11:57] <MootPoot> that and the magical girl site are the only magical girl shows I ever finished
[20:12:02] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I mean, that gets into a different argument I once had with amigo that I really think there are 2 different genres of magical girls, and madoka is what amigo was wanting me to call "fake mmagical girls"
[20:12:04] <MootPoot> and you dont consider the latter a magical girl show
[20:12:17] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: but also I don't understand how you could have watched all of Madoka and thought it had no plot?
[20:12:29] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: Madoka has a fuck ton of plot. You might not LIKE it, but that's a different question
[20:12:31] <MootPoot> no, I just thought it wasent very good
[20:12:45] <MootPoot> then when I moved to other shows, I thought they had hair thin plots
[20:12:50] <Guest30> In general doesn't magical girls as a genre fall into how comic superheroes also have their sub-genres?
[20:13:02] <MootPoot> dont get me wrong
[20:13:09] <DandereNoises> Guest30: I don't know what you mean, maybe in that there are a lot of them, and they vary
[20:13:17] <MootPoot> having a mindless action flick isen't really a problem to me
[20:13:23] <MootPoot> nor is having a mindless magical girl plot
[20:13:28] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: and I actually dislike mindless action flicks
[20:13:34] <DandereNoises> but I like magical girls
[20:13:42] <Guest30> Initially it was meant to push stories of 'courage' and what-not, then it devolved into some marketing ploy. Along with some different spins like a gritty stories.
[20:13:44] <DandereNoises> but there are some magical girl shows I think are shit

[20:14:17] <Guest30> Take the fantasy genre for one. You have a large influx of dark-fantasy themes floating about nowadays.
[20:14:21] <DandereNoises> Guest30: I don't buy your narrative in either case, first all media at that level had some amount of marketting even from the start, and 2nd I'm not sure it was ever about anything like that in a broad sense
[20:14:41] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: and I think that's misguided in enough cases that it bothers me as a generalization
[20:14:58] <MootPoot> well, you can call it misguided in your POV, that's fair
[20:15:15] <MootPoot> just dont point at me and tell me I'm just adopting other people's stereotypes
[20:15:16] <DandereNoises> or yeah, "fantasy genre" I'd debate if that even counts as a single genre, being in a fantasy world can have all kinds of different stories, at this point many of them unrelated to each other
[20:15:33] <Jigsy> I wonder why people always scream during earthquakes...
[20:15:36] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I never said that though, now who is making assumptions
[20:15:53] <MootPoot> ....
[20:15:54] <DandereNoises> Jigsy: they want to see if adding a bit more vibration will break anything
[20:15:56] <Guest30> DandereNoises True, though that is strictly in terms that comic books are a media that is meant to be consumed. By the end of the day telling stories need to be able to make a profit in order to meaningful.

[20:16:45] *** Parts: pflo (~pflo@user/pflo) (Leaving)
[20:16:49] <DandereNoises> stereotypes are just generalization, they don't have to be OTHER PEOPLE's generalizations
[20:16:52] <MootPoot> a cultural view of something 
[20:17:02] <DandereNoises> you can stereotype all on your own
[20:17:07] <Guest30> Now we're just getting quite pedantic.
[20:17:13] <MootPoot> >a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.
[20:17:17] <MootPoot> widely held
[20:17:25] <DandereNoises> Guest30: no, I think this may have been the root of the whole argument
[20:17:49] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: widely held doesn't mean you got the idea from someone else
[20:17:49] <Guest30> DandereNoises Please elaborate?
[20:18:00] <MootPoot> idk about you but a single person on their own cant "widely hold" a view
[20:18:07] <DandereNoises> even if we take that definition as gospel, it doesn't support what you're saying MootPoot
[20:18:11] <MootPoot> it does
[20:18:22] <MootPoot> widely held -> its cultural
[20:18:26] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: so you can't hold a widely held view if you didn't get it from someone else?
[20:18:44] <Guest30> What I was going for earlier was that the 'magical-girl' genre has many sub-genres that you don't have to limit yourself to the entire genre. You can pick and choose what you want.
[20:18:45] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: you're using that definition wrong here
[20:18:48] <MootPoot> you can hold a widely held view, but if you didnt get it from the culture then its not a sterotype
[20:19:07] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: that's not true, AND that's not what the definition you found says either
[20:19:18] <MootPoot> also I dont think its a widely held view 
[20:19:27] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: you can come to your own conclusion and end up with a widely held belief
[20:19:34] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I hear it all the fucking time
[20:19:47] <MootPoot> or maybe being in ##anime has borked my sense of what the current norms are
[20:20:09] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: also you spend less time talking with people on the internet about magical girls than I do, I'd bet
[20:20:17] <Guest30> Maybe it's time to stop forming opinions based on other's?
[20:20:24] <MootPoot> Guest30: sit
[20:20:25] <DandereNoises> Guest30: no one is doing that
[20:20:42] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: honey, our guest keeps losing the conversation
[20:21:01] <DandereNoises> the issue is MootPoot THINKS I was accusing him of that when I wasn't, and now we're arguing about his wrong interpretation of a definition of stereotype he found that I actually think isa  fine definition if you read the words carefully
[20:21:13] <DandereNoises> yeah, maybe we should kick him out
[20:21:27] <Guest30> Well, here's the issue. You guys just said that you guys were having a "Weeb fight", and never really cared to explain the context.
[20:21:32] <MootPoot> WEEB FIGHT
[20:21:39] <DandereNoises> anyway, MootPoot, I don't and never did think you were just repeating other people's opinions
[20:21:40] <MootPoot> Guest30: you dont need context - scroll up

[20:22:13] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: okay, thats fair
[20:22:15] <MootPoot> now
[20:22:16] <Guest30> MootPoot About that, it is IRC afterall. Chat log persistence isn't my thing.
[20:22:17] <MootPoot> onto magical girls
[20:22:35] <MootPoot> or well, my way of watching things
[20:22:40] <MootPoot> I'll try everything
[20:22:54] <MootPoot> but if I'm not at least 5/10 into it by episode 2
[20:22:57] <MootPoot> I drop it
[20:22:58] <Guest30> MootPoot How about crack?
[20:23:04] <MootPoot> Guest30: sit
[20:23:17] <MootPoot> so either one of three things is  happening
[20:23:29] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: that's fair, I drop lots of stuff too, and I've found I'm much happier when I drop stuff quicker
[20:23:39] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: too much out there, and too much I don't like
[20:23:49] <Guest30> What are you looking for with a magical girl-genre story anyway?
[20:23:53] <MootPoot> 1.) I just dont like the genre 2.) most good magical girl shows are late game scalers - good at the end 3.) I somehow have only found mostly trash
[20:24:05] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: but my objection is that I don't think you can make claims about the plot of the average magical girl show based on the first episode
[20:24:12] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I DO think you can make claims that you didn't like it
[20:24:15] <DandereNoises> that's fine
[20:24:18] <Guest30> Do you have any type of story you initially enjoy?
[20:24:24] <DandereNoises> "Claims" obviously just fact, whatever
[20:24:29] <DandereNoises> words are hard
[20:24:34] <MootPoot> what do you think if I told you I dont like most sports anime on the same ~2 episode criteria
[20:24:42] <MootPoot> and call that genre shit too
[20:24:46] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, I think 2 and 3 are big points here
[20:25:08] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I'd say I have liked quite a few sports anime, but also I kind of agree with that
[20:25:11] <MootPoot> the only sports anime that got me was haikyuu and I stopped giviing a shit after s2
[20:25:15] <DandereNoises> there are a lot of sports anime that suck
[20:25:17] <DandereNoises> same with idols
[20:25:22] <MootPoot> oh
[20:25:30] <MootPoot> with idols I have a special hatred
[20:25:41] <MootPoot> I know its largely trash 
[20:25:50] <DandereNoises> I think idols more than the others have like 1 garbage idol show per season
[20:25:58] <Guest30> What sort of 'idols'?
[20:26:02] <MootPoot> but the thing that gets me is the 10fps powerpoint 3dcg dance scenes
[20:26:05] <MootPoot> Guest30: tiki idols
[20:26:10] <DandereNoises> cute girls singing
[20:26:24] <Guest30> I was thinking of the real thing. Shame.
[20:26:29] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: I have no idea why liteally the ENTIRE DRAW of the entire show
[20:26:37] <MootPoot> they decide to make in shitty 5fps 3dcg
[20:26:40] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, anything with cgi dancing I can at best like IN SPITE of the cgi dancing
[20:26:59] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: to be fair, I think the idol shows I've liked best aren't as much about the actual concerts
[20:27:03] <MootPoot> I remember when a dude I know was showing me a special dance thing 
[20:27:10] <DandereNoises> probably for that reason
[20:27:12] <MootPoot> 60-70 dollars for what was the big idol thing
[20:27:17] <MootPoot> uhh
[20:27:29] <MootPoot> love live sunshine
[20:27:32] <MootPoot> quos soemthing
[20:27:35] <Guest30> I think 3D Idol Animation is paved from good intentions. Since there are many aspects of dancing and choreography presentation.
[20:27:47] <MootPoot> and he told me the cd or something was 60 bucks
[20:27:51] <DandereNoises> anything with singing in it has an extra problem: lazy-ass "official" subs never sub the fucking lyrics
[20:27:55] <MootPoot> for a fucking 5fps 3dcg dance anime
[20:27:57] <DandereNoises> and often the lyrics are plot-relevant
[20:28:00] <Guest30> Depth and positioning along with a heap load of other factors.
[20:28:10] <MootPoot> I actually get motion sick watching those shows
[20:28:13] <MootPoot> I cant
[20:28:34] <DandereNoises> yeah anime merchandising is bullshit
[20:28:40] <Guest30> MootPoot How about actual shows. Do you oft get motion sickness?
[20:28:46] <DandereNoises> just spend all your money simping for vtubers instead
[20:28:50] <MootPoot> ^
[20:28:56] <MootPoot> vtubers have higher FPS then idol anime
[20:28:58] <MootPoot> kek
[20:29:10] <DandereNoises> yeah, hololive is the best idol anime running lately

[20:30:52] <MootPoot> I hope  idol anime dies
[20:30:57] <MootPoot> and we can replace it with vtubers
[20:30:58] <ButterNoodle> D all of the above
[20:31:00] <DandereNoises> I hope idol anime gets better
[20:31:02] <MootPoot> better, higher quality
[20:31:06] <ButterNoodle> they all make me a jerk off terrorist
[20:31:08] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: it needs to be reborn
[20:31:13] <MootPoot> like the pheonix
[20:31:31] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: what if we had an idol anime, where we used the models and voices of all the hololive girls as the characters
[20:31:35] <Guest30> The terrorism angle was just for the potential chance. Vtuber culture has some very heavy chinese connections.
[20:31:43] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: they better not make it 5fps
[20:32:13] <MootPoot> what if the reason why they do that is because non of the otakus into that crap can afford anything else besides a tv from like
[20:32:14] <DandereNoises> Guest30: uh, there are chinese vtubers, but the biggest vtuber company completely cut ties with china a while back
[20:32:17] <MootPoot> the  1980s
[20:32:18] <Guest30> MootPoot Many fanworks in native language featuring Vtubers in some form of visual novel.
[20:32:34] <MootPoot> after spending all their money on anime merch
[20:32:41] <Guest30> DandereNoises I don't really buy that.
[20:32:47] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: they don't want to watch their waifus in high def?
[20:32:51] <Urchin[emacs]> hi DandereNoises 
[20:33:39] <DandereNoises> Guest30: I mean, business records are public about this stuff, and there was a lot of really high profile hostility from china because they acknowledged Taiwan was a thing that existed
[20:33:43] <MootPoot> I dont like dogs
[20:33:46] <MootPoot> well
[20:33:48] <MootPoot> I like dogs

[20:34:56] <MootPoot> I'll take Korone-19
[20:35:07] <DandereNoises> Guest30: I'm not talking clickbaity news, I'm talking drama that was unfolding for months a couple years back, and yes, japanese companies disclose their investors
[20:35:10] <MootPoot> although I only watch like 3-4 vtubers
[20:35:13] <MootPoot> tbh
[20:35:31] <MootPoot> botan, choco, matsuri and I think sometimes senchou
[20:35:48] <DandereNoises> Guest30: I just don't know where you're getting this conspiracy theory from, not only is it contrary to evidence, it seems to be about something you don't really care or know about, and it doesn't explain anything
[20:36:00] <Guest30> DandereNoises Sorry. I'm a bit out of it at the moment. I just put most of the terms in one heap along with 'Drama'.
[20:36:06] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I never watch Choco, and I feel a bit sad about it, but there's only so much time in the day

[20:41:38] <MootPoot> you know what
[20:41:45] <MootPoot> I'll add one more onto my list
[20:41:57] <MootPoot> mecha anime is also largely shit and paper thing
[20:41:59] <MootPoot> thin
[20:42:06] <MootPoot> except I like mecha generally
[20:42:18] <MootPoot> they fucked it all up with this gundam build nonsense
[20:42:35] <MootPoot> and the entire mecha genre has so few releases at it is
[20:42:40] <MootPoot> as*
[20:42:49] <MootPoot> so we end up with like one good one every 5 years
[20:43:44] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: I can't help but think there's more shit isekai than any of those though
[20:43:52] <MootPoot> you know what
[20:43:53] <DandereNoises> really anything that gets popular enough produces a lot of shit
[20:43:58] <MootPoot> I like the shit isekai
[20:44:19] <MootPoot> I like how they keep on coming up with new angles for it
[20:44:22] <MootPoot> nonstop
[20:44:22] <DandereNoises> I mean, cgdct are my isekai I guess, I even kind of like that bad ones
[20:44:28] <DandereNoises> but I won't argue that they are as good as the good ones
[20:44:41] <MootPoot> but cgcdt is just cgdct
[20:44:49] <MootPoot> it dosent have the variance of isekai
[20:44:54] <MootPoot> like what was that one
[20:45:06] <MootPoot> endgame villager gets moved to the starting village
[20:45:12] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: it does have variance, in every anime, they are doing DIFFERENT CUTE THINGS
[20:45:16] <MootPoot> then theres that ojii san one
[20:45:28] <MootPoot> then GATE, ofc
[20:45:29] <DandereNoises> sometimes they go fishing, sometimes they hike, sometimes they do astronomy, sometimes they put on plays
[20:45:41] <DandereNoises> ugh gate
[20:45:54] <MootPoot> I mean gate wasen't really good but
[20:45:58] <DandereNoises> Gate is one of those things I found myself hatewatching the whole way through
[20:46:08] <DandereNoises> like I probably should have dropped it but I didn't
[20:46:10] <MootPoot> I like the varience and constant novelty of isekai
[20:46:28] <MootPoot> its something no other genre has
[20:46:34] <Urchin[emacs]> for me, Gate was just slightly better than meh
[20:46:49] <Urchin[emacs]> but, today, I probably wouldn't give it the first look
[20:46:53] <MootPoot> fucking slime anime
[20:47:02] <MootPoot> and the spider reincarnation isekai one
[20:47:04] <DandereNoises> I really don't think a lot of those variations in the shit isekai shows amount to much variation at all
[20:47:09] <DandereNoises> in the bigger sense
[20:47:20] <DandereNoises> I hated that fucking spider one
[20:47:23] <MootPoot> DandereNoises: its still bound to the general rules of isekai
[20:47:27] <MootPoot> I agree
[20:47:32] <MootPoot> but its more variance then like
[20:47:35] <DandereNoises> that's another one I wanted to like
[20:47:36] <MootPoot> idol anime
[20:47:38] <DandereNoises> and so I hate it more
[20:47:40] <MootPoot> or sports anime
[20:47:41] <DandereNoises> spider I mean
[20:47:47] <MootPoot> I never watched it

[20:48:14] <Bco1981> MootPoot: akb0048 is kinda different
[20:48:17] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: the "rules" of isekai are still pretty damn rigid when you think about it, so many tropes that are more common than they need to be, I think down to actually lack of creativity
[20:48:24] <Bco1981> there is a bit more to the story
[20:48:32] <DandereNoises> MootPoot: spider? it just gets into wasting a ton of time on number wank

[20:51:04] <MootPoot> its ridgid in some ways
[20:51:09] <MootPoot> rigid*
[20:51:13] <DandereNoises> my problem with isekai is too much of it is bad fanfict
[20:51:14] <DandereNoises> fanfic
[20:51:17] <MootPoot> but in other ways it completely does not give a fuck
[20:51:22] <MootPoot> and does whatever it want
[20:51:23] <MootPoot> s
[20:51:40] <DandereNoises> and I'd say the same thing about magical girls actually
[20:51:48] <DandereNoises> in some ways, a lot of magical girl shows do some weird shit
[20:52:29] <DandereNoises> but actually some of the most interesting variances are in precure, a like 18 season franchise for children
[20:52:40] <MootPoot> I cant

[22:56:17] <emmeka> it's the ideal connection, in that way
[22:56:25] <emmeka> it also doesn't have HDCP, so yay

[22:56:42] <emmeka> no, that's definitely practice
[22:57:00] <emmeka> ground loops are shit and make everything sound worse and most people just live with it, and they don't have to
[22:57:12] <MootPoot> again, if your connections are not shit
[22:57:16] <MootPoot> and your cables are not shit
[22:57:24] <MootPoot> that's not a problem you should be having
[22:57:25] <emmeka> your connections being shit and your cables being not shit doesn't matter
[22:57:30] <emmeka> that's irrelevant to a ground loop
[22:57:38] <emmeka> the question is whether you have multiple grounds
[22:58:09] <MootPoot> I've only ever had ground loop issues with 3.5 jacks
[22:58:14] <MootPoot> never with hdmi or DP
[22:58:25] <emmeka> you're probably just not noticing them, because HDMI does have a ground, so
[22:58:37] <MootPoot> or maybe audio processing takes care of it
[22:58:56] <emmeka> no, your audio processing is the thing affected by ground loops.
[22:58:59] <MootPoot> I'm 100% sure that there is no humm or buzz in my audio things
[22:59:01] <Bco1981> but, you would only hear it if you had audio from the monitor.
[22:59:10] <Bco1981> nobody does that
[22:59:12] <MootPoot> I do
[22:59:19] <emmeka> ground loops don't affect the signal. they affect the hardware.
[22:59:40] <MootPoot> my audio goes 1 of 2 ways
[22:59:41] <emmeka> the signal the HDMI is passing is fine, but the fact that it causes a ground loop comprimises the audio performance of the hardware.
[22:59:55] <MootPoot> either pc -> usb -> mic+amp combo 
[23:00:09] <MootPoot> or pc -> dp -> monitor -> bose soundbar
[23:00:26] <emmeka> the latter one sounds ground loop-y
[23:00:32] <Bco1981> why don't you just plug the soundbar to the pc ?
[23:00:35] <MootPoot> there is none
[23:00:47] <MootPoot> Bco1981: cant be fucked to buy another aux cable
[23:00:48] <MootPoot> lol
[23:00:59] <emmeka> why aux to soundbar though
[23:01:04] <emmeka> get a toslink cable, jeez
[23:01:08] <MootPoot> since I have a short aux
[23:01:12] <MootPoot> not a long one
[23:01:16] <MootPoot> I'd have to buy a long one
[23:01:34] <MootPoot> oh wow this bar does have toslink
[23:01:58] <MootPoot> but also there is another reason why
[23:02:15] <MootPoot> if I wire pc->bar that means when I watch amazon prime on my monitor I wont get audio
[23:02:28] <MootPoot> since I have to switch inputs from my fire stick
[23:02:28] <Bco1981> ... why not ?
[23:02:32] <emmeka> MootPoot anyway, point being no, these things make a legitimate difference for weird reasons. Not because the signal is problematic - you are right that the exact same 1s and 0s will reach a device whether HDMI or toslink - but for stupider reasons like the fact that HDCP exists, or, ground loops being caused

[23:03:31] <emmeka> toslink is basically the ideal cable. it is passive, it is immune to ground loops, immune to interference, high fidelity, cheap, supports all standards, and is used universally by pretty much everything.

[23:06:43] <MootPoot> I doubt a switch exists that can do that for that little
[23:06:50] <emmeka> sure it does. I own one.
[23:06:56] <emmeka> mine's fancier than what you need, even.
[23:07:01] <MootPoot> the kind that would work for me*
[23:07:03] <MootPoot> hdmi sure, but I need to use DP1.4

[23:07:53] <emmeka> you're right that DP's the better connection of the two

[23:09:31] <MootPoot> emmeka: if you can find a switch that supports dp1.4 with 4k 144hz + HDR passthough
[23:09:34] <MootPoot> I'll be all ears
[23:09:38] <MootPoot> until then
[23:10:33] <mixfix41> oh i see. my mobo has those i never use those
[23:10:44] <Nanobot> There's a phenomenon called the Streisand Effect, where large groups of people share a common false memory of something. The term comes its most famous example, where people falsely remember that Barbra Streisand sued a website in order to take down a photo of her mansion, leading the photo to become much more popular than before the lawsuit. In fact, this never happened. There is no photo of her mansion on the Internet. There is a photo that is widely 
[23:10:44] <Nanobot> misreported as being of her mansion, but the photo is actually of part of a prison compound in South Africa where civil rights leader Nelson Mandela famously died.
[23:10:46] <mixfix41> could go the way dvi did
[23:11:34] <emmeka> Nanobot that sure was a roller coaster.
[23:11:37] <mixfix41> bluetooth is great if you doing it all from embed hardware
[23:11:42] <MootPoot> emmeka: I have to replace my DP cable anyway - its giving me distortion
[23:11:52] <emmeka> mixfix41 bluetooth is bad and you should feel bad
[23:11:57] <MootPoot> the adage of "every digital cable is the same" seems to not be the case
[23:11:57] <emmeka> at least for audio
[23:12:00] <mixfix41> 12 feet distance 
[23:12:16] <mixfix41> optical cord < 6 ft
[23:12:20] <MootPoot> vanilla BT is bad
[23:12:33] <MootPoot> I've had good results with the additional flavour stuff
[23:12:47] <mixfix41> well not android i say
[23:13:03] <mixfix41> i mean open source , close as possible to POSIX standard posix = positive the setup is positive
[23:13:24] <MootPoot> emmeka: also I'm not sure but those splitters..do they passthrough HDCP as well
[23:13:33] <MootPoot> fire dick is picky about that as well
[23:13:35] <mixfix41> and if you have a 3d printer you can print your own breadboard and buy the cheap 5g/bt components
[23:13:36] <emmeka> yeah. they have to.
[23:14:16] <emmeka> MootPoot mine's pretty speedy about HDCP syncing, even though it's a matrix switch. it's faster than an old splitter I had once.
[23:15:20] <MootPoot> A few extroverts from my uni are posting about their first computer jobs

[23:17:50] <DandereNoises> Nanobot: so how are the Berenstein Bears related to the Streisand Effect?
[23:18:28] <mixfix41> nvm logitech speakers woofer combo has no input
[23:18:40] <mixfix41> it has control knobs though

[23:21:09] <MootPoot> wonder if there any good FOSS projects I can start to contribute to
[23:21:16] <emmeka> mixfix41 your TV likely has an optical output, not an optical input
[23:21:43] <emmeka> most of them have optical as audio out, so e.g. you wire everything as HDMI to your TV, and then optical from the TV to the soundbar
[23:22:07] <Bco1981> or receiver
[23:22:19] <emmeka> usually you'd just run everything into the receiver, though
[23:22:47] <emmeka> unless it's a game console, I guess. then you'd want direct connection to the TV + audio connection from console to the receiver (like toslink)
[23:23:42] <mixfix41> silverblue is starting up moot
[23:24:54] <MootPoot> I dont know  C
[23:24:57] <emmeka> MootPoot really it's kind of annoying that PC monitors don't have that feature the way TV's do, so you could just run HDMI or DP to your monitor, and then optical out from the monitor to soundbar/active speakers
[23:25:06] <emmeka> it seems like a sensible thing
[23:25:09] <MootPoot> emmeka: mine does tho

[23:25:33] <MootPoot> lemme see
[23:25:41] <MootPoot> it does have 3.5 output
[23:25:49] <emmeka> terrible
[23:26:04] <MootPoot> yeah only 3.5
[23:26:15] <emmeka> that's what we need, a terrible DAC, and not just something trivial like passing through digital
[23:26:22] <mixfix41> good point i dont either
[23:26:28] <mixfix41> project in itself
[23:28:14] <MootPoot> wellactually
[23:28:17] <MootPoot> I just realzied
[23:28:22] <MootPoot> there is maybe one way I could do it
[23:28:50] <MootPoot> if I actually bought a sound card for my pc
[23:28:55] <MootPoot> wired the 3.5mm output to it
[23:29:06] <MootPoot> then sound card toslink to soundbar
[23:29:18] <Bco1981> would be best
[23:30:00] <MootPoot> oh, wait
[23:30:03] <MootPoot> wha
[23:30:05] <MootPoot> okay
[23:30:13] <MootPoot> apparently my mobo already has a toslink out 
[23:30:18] <MootPoot> I never noticed
[23:30:19] <MootPoot> lol
[23:30:41] <MootPoot> could just loop the audio out
[23:31:11] <MootPoot> emmeka: so according to you
[23:31:28] <MootPoot> it doen't really matter how many chains it goes through
[23:31:36] <MootPoot> or links
[23:31:55] <MootPoot> only that at the very end - the audio has to be optical to the speaker
[23:32:51] <mixfix41> feels like a saturday when there arent any clouds outside

[23:34:34] <emmeka> MootPoot yeah pretty much
[23:34:36] <mixfix41> and also if worst comes to worst you can send audio data to which ever machine has that port
[23:34:49] <mixfix41> with ethernet or wifi
[23:35:50] <emmeka> ethernet still causes ground loops. bluetooth is lossy.
[23:36:15] <mixfix41> !c ground loops
[23:36:16] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: In an electrical system, a ground loop or earth loop occurs when two points of a circuit are intended to have the same ground reference potential but instead have a different potential between them.
