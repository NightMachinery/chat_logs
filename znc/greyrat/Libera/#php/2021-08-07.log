[02:21:34] <relipse> i most always google before I ask
[02:21:46] <relipse> jus twondering if someone does that on a day to day basis
[02:22:31] <Blondie101010> not sure what you mean
[02:23:03] <Blondie101010> this implies that a programmer makes the required tools to do that task
[02:23:34] <Blondie101010> but I can imagine some places to require more programmers or IT skilled people to define mappings regularly
[02:24:49] <Blondie101010> it depends on what you work on
[02:25:42] <Blondie101010> I know a place where it's more common is when you connect businesses to other businesses
[02:26:03] <Blondie101010> each has their own format and specs
[02:26:43] *** LSD is now known as acidsys
[02:26:59] <Blondie101010> but actually that's more focused than what ETL stands for
[02:27:04] <Blondie101010> just an example
[02:28:21] <Blondie101010> some business processes depend a lot on data extraction from probes, reports
[02:29:07] <Blondie101010> frankly not a term I usually refer to
[02:29:58] <Blondie101010> taking a step back, it represents many common operations
[02:30:22] <relipse> do you think that may be like using regex to parse through and grab data?
[02:30:50] <Blondie101010> regex might be useful in some, possibly many, cases
[02:30:57] <relipse> nice
[02:31:17] <Blondie101010> the point is to have a way to get the data you want, normalize it, and load it in your DB
[02:31:27] <relipse> nice, i like doing that kind of work
[02:31:45] <Blondie101010> not bad, but it's repetitive
[02:32:03] <Sammitch> writing your own ETL pipelines from scratch: here be madness.
[02:32:06] <Blondie101010> after you've done 50 similar mappings, it can be boring
[02:32:23] <Byteflux> Depending on your use case, there are specific ETL tools, too.
[02:32:35] <Sammitch> ^
[02:35:01] <Byteflux> but it's essentially just downloading data from one or more sources, normalizing/transforming it, and then loading it into a DB. the whole process could be easily conceptualized in 3 interfaces: extractor, transformer, loader. rolling your own thing from scratch could be trivial depending on what you're doing

[02:41:02] <Blondie101010> it usually is
[02:43:29] <Byteflux> hard part is probably optimizing throughput, since when we talk about ETL we're usually talking about bulk data
[02:45:13] <Sammitch> you're going to want to design things to scale _out_, not up.
[02:45:31] * Blondie101010 nods

Looking at the nginx logs, it's clear that the request is indeed a POST. Is there some obvious mistake i could be making with my PHP? ty
[03:56:36] <Nomikos> physikoi: I would look at the form action, or the way you are sending an ajax request
[03:57:33] <Nomikos> anything that gets put in the url will end up in $_GET, even when the action is post

[20:06:15] <__adrian> well, no... not with numeric keys, actually.
[20:06:39] <__adrian> you'd have to do this manually.
[20:06:51] <__adrian> that is, write your own function for it

[20:18:33] <celphi> you can give links to everyone elses code, doesnt matter- but if you want a solution to your problem then you're going to have to at the bare mininum explain your problem with a simple example
[20:19:09] <biberu> __adrian: idd, often they are better examples of what *not* to do ^^
[20:19:15] <__adrian> but, do not use create_function(). it's a poor solution to defining a function, it's easy to introduce errors, and it's easy to make it into a severe security risk. it's the same as using eval().
[20:19:54] <__adrian> also, returning to your code, you don't need it anyway.

[20:23:49] <__adrian> the example is clear

[20:47:40] <olle> Urgh

[20:48:02] <__adrian> i'm not making you  :)
[20:48:11] <__adrian> but if you want to draw your picture, it's kinda necessary
[20:49:16] <olle> I always feel like those "architectural patterns" are mostly word poo...
[20:49:26] <olle> Or splitting hairs.
[20:49:51] <olle> The important part is how they affect quality attributes.

[20:52:56] <olle> That's just software fashion, sorry
[20:53:19] <celphi> my example is based strictly that the keys are numerically increasing on $arr1
[20:53:19] <olle> MVC is an architectural pattern. But, semantics...

[20:58:16] <__adrian> oh, tjSs4
[21:00:48] <__adrian> tl;dr: yes
[21:00:58] <__adrian> a little sloppy, but clearer imo:  https://3v4l.org/GTeWO
[21:01:23] <__adrian> i'd probably loop instead of using array_reduce in the first place, but it's fine
[21:01:56] <__adrian> is_string() is the part you probably shouldn't have
[21:02:21] <celphi> why not
[21:02:26] <__adrian> i.e., it works with this example input, but would fail with other values
[21:02:39] <__adrian> e.g., if there were an int value
[21:02:51] <__adrian> you'd end up overwriting instead of making an array
[21:02:53] <celphi> k
[21:03:05] <celphi> then i should check is_array and !is_array
[21:03:16] <__adrian> basically
[21:03:18] <celphi> k
[21:03:20] <__adrian> see my example
[21:03:30] <celphi> good catch - yeah not familiar with array_merge yet
[21:03:30] <__adrian> well, except i don't check
[21:03:35] <__adrian> that's my "sloppy" part
[21:04:24] <celphi> when i see array_merge it isnt very confincing to me what it does

[21:06:40] <celphi> k
[21:07:42] <celphi> is it more popular to line up `=` in assignments

[22:21:03] <Simplar> ...and PHP gets it from Axios with dots replaced by underscores? what?
[22:22:03] <da_wunder> Simplar: check your request response content to make sure that all is there as you expect
[22:22:16] <da_wunder> Simplar: if not - then your backend is doing that
[22:22:47] <Blondie101010> Simplar:  not sure I completely follow, but I think I do...  is it possible that Axios intentionally does that?
[22:23:18] <Simplar> in Firefox's debugging tools, request is still with dots
[22:23:33] <Simplar> on php's end, it's already non dots
[22:23:56] <Simplar> {"token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiJ9.eyJl(aaaand so on)}
[22:24:02] <Simplar> it's how it looks as Request
[22:24:48] <Simplar> This, however, is in response: eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiJ9_eyJleHAiOjE2Mjg5(and so on)
[22:24:57] <da_wunder> ok, so if you see those dots in your request - then your php application is making that change somewhere - we don't know what your application does - so quite hard to try to help
[22:25:50] <da_wunder> most likely your php application has some middleware to alter request data or something
[22:26:20] <Simplar> Well, kind of a middleware called express-php

[22:34:55] <da_wunder> Simplar: please just use xdebug and add breakpoint to your main php file first line - and just step through all that and see where that is done
[22:35:37] <Stanley> whats the best way to always display a +/- infront of a number?
[22:35:42] <Blondie101010> Simplar:  on the very first line of your script: var_dump($_REQUEST); die();
[22:35:46] <da_wunder> Simplar: and before that make sure that your request _really_ contains those dots as you're expecting - maybe your client side is doing something there
[22:36:04] <Stanley> Is there a cleaner way other than $number > 0 ? '+'.$number : '-'.$number ?
[22:36:15] <Blondie101010> it's obviously the class they use ($request)
[22:36:31] <da_wunder> Stanley: in that case you get `-0`
[22:36:40] <Simplar> It's already with an underscore in $_POST
[22:36:46] <Stanley> da_wunder yeah that wasn't a perfect example
[22:36:50] <Simplar> thus, php is not the problem, I guess
[22:36:57] <__adrian> Stanley: what are you trying to solve? e.g.,  echo -5;  produces "-5"
[22:36:59] <Blondie101010> Simplar:  did you check on the very first line of the script?
[22:37:19] <Simplar> e.g. the script where I autoload things from Composer?
[22:37:26] <da_wunder> Simplar: so just please check your request and confirm if those dots are there or not - third time I ask you to do that
[22:37:27] <Simplar> If yes then yes
[22:37:52] <Blondie101010> then you need to look in between
[22:37:52] <Simplar> I did, odd thing is, dots are in the request object
[22:38:12] <Blondie101010> don't know how but it might be coming from the webserver
[22:38:12] <Stanley> @__adrian When a new record is written to the database it calculates the difference between the current state and last known state and saves it in it's own column, so the DB record will have a decimal(5,2) field that will be anything from -999.99 to +999.99, when I get the value of the field though it's $number = -5 or $number = 7
[22:38:13] <da_wunder> Simplar: I mean your browser dev tools...
[22:38:21] <Simplar> Yes
[22:38:28] <Simplar> I've seen dots exactly in dev tools
[22:38:34] <Stanley> But when displaying the "difference" i'd much rather it say +5 not just 5

[22:51:52] <da_wunder> Simplar: did you look this - https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-make-http-requests-like-a-pro-with-axios/#postjson ?
[22:52:32] <Stanley> @__adrian man the sprintf docs can really use some love, haha
[22:52:36] <__adrian> re: conversion: it's done because php expects keys to be usable as variable names.
[22:52:59] <TML> Stanley: contributions are not only welcome, but openly solicited :)
[22:53:26] <Stanley> I can't contribute to something I don't understand, haha
[22:53:32] <__adrian> Stanley: really they're just there as a primer. there's somthing of an assumption that you already know how sprintf works. not like php made it all up.
[22:54:29] <Blondie101010> Stanley:  printf is a very extensively complete standard function which has existed in C for many decades, so you can find a lot of information on it outside of PHP
[22:54:37] <TML> Stanley: well, once you understand it enough to solve your problem, contribute :)
[22:55:16] <Stanley> Blondie101010 fair enough; but one would expect to be able to understand how to use a php function from the PHP docs
[22:55:23] <__adrian> sure
[22:55:25] <Stanley> anyways, not really complaining, was just having a laugh
[22:55:32] <__adrian> and it tells you how to use the function very clearly
[22:55:36] <Blondie101010> it's similar to regex, it is its own language
[22:55:55] <Stanley> Blondie101010 ah
[22:55:58] <__adrian> like preg_* functions or PDO. it's the php manual, not a PCRE or MySQL manual.
[22:56:25] <Blondie101010> don't know if there's a name for printf formats though
[22:56:27] <__adrian> (not saying it couldn't be better, just that there's scope involved)
[22:56:29] <Stanley> is there a good "defacto" source for sprintf that should be linked maybe?
[22:57:07] <__adrian> ...not sure
[22:57:08] <Stanley> I honestly had no clue; knowing nothing about sprintf and looking the docs I was lost, if there was a little "Look here for more info" it would be beneficial for sure
[22:57:18] <__adrian> for php, probably how C does it
[22:57:27] <Blondie101010> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.printf.php is pretty clear on the format
[22:57:53] <Blondie101010> it just doesn't provide many examples because it would be too hard to condense
[22:57:58] <__adrian> it _is_ a dense read but not sure that's something that could be "fixed"
[22:58:32] <Blondie101010> I agree
[22:59:10] <TML> Stanley: The problem being that if printf already makes sense to you, it's a bit hard then to get into the mindset of someone who doesn't know printf to even understand what we should improve
[22:59:26] <Blondie101010> it used to be very useful for proper formatting in CLI but today there are simpler ways to handle the presentation
[22:59:32] <TML> if you have a specific suggestion on what is confusing, I'm open to it
[22:59:45] <__adrian> ...and if it doesn't already make sense to you, it's still difficult to know which part needs improved
[23:00:02] <Stanley> I think one big step forward in the docs would be that lots of the examples don't show the output
[23:00:04] <Simplar> ...dang.
[23:00:16] <Stanley> I can run it myself for sure but it slows down the reading the docs process
[23:00:19] <Blondie101010> I think his impression simply comes from the printf format steep learning curve
[23:00:27] <__adrian> yeah
[23:00:36] <Simplar> CORS Preflight Did Not Succeed
[23:00:41] <Simplar> With that type, this is what I see
[23:00:44] <TML> Stanley: Uh - where on the sprintf page do you see an example that doesn't show the output
[23:00:45] <Stanley> @__adrian: ...and if it doesn't already make sense to you, it's still difficult to know which part needs improved
[23:00:47] <Stanley> hahaha yeah exactly
[23:01:00] <Stanley> If you understand, you don't know what people don't understand
[23:01:06] <TML> "The above example will output:
[23:01:08] <Stanley> if you don't understand you don't know what you don't understand
[23:01:13] <TML> all over the place
[23:01:34] <Stanley> Example 1 has the output from the initial
[23:01:44] <Stanley> and then modifies it 3 times with no output
[23:01:52] <TML> Stanley: the output doesn't change
[23:02:01] <TML> those examples all give the same output
[23:02:17] <TML> if you read the actual words between the examples they explain that
[23:03:05] <Stanley> Okay well as you were saying before; as someone with no prior knowledge to printf that's not very clear to me
[23:03:06] <Blondie101010> Stanley:  you might want to look at https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.printf.php
[23:03:12] <Blondie101010> it has different examples
[23:03:36] <Blondie101010> why do you need to format a string that way?
[23:03:40] <Stanley> Blondie101010 ah yes they do thanks!
[23:03:53] <TML> Stanley: Are you actually reading the documentation, or just scanning the examples and the outputs?
[23:03:55] *** Quits: Akimb (~Akimb@78-58-31-17.static.zebra.lt) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:04:04] *** Quits: NakedKing (~NakedKing@user/nakedking) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[23:04:16] <TML> I would grant that the PHP docs aren't well suited to the latter
[23:04:28] <__adrian> yes and no
[23:04:34] <Stanley> I understand that you probably get many people in here that don't read the docs; but I certainly am
[23:04:39] <__adrian> it's not well-suited to scan+copy+paste
[23:04:52] <Blondie101010> Stanley:  why do you need to use sprintf()?
[23:04:56] <da_wunder> and if those docs are missing something - just create a pull request to fix those and help whole community
[23:05:02] <Blondie101010> it is quite uncommon today
[23:05:22] <__adrian> people don't get that examples are for showing you specific behaviors, not for showing you snippets you might actually put in your app
[23:05:25] <Stanley> Blondie101010 I have a number and I need to always display it with it's sign
[23:05:41] <Blondie101010> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.number-format
[23:06:00] <__adrian> that doesn't do the sign, blondie
[23:06:08] <Blondie101010> oh really
[23:06:15] <__adrian> nope
[23:06:26] <__adrian> i honestly don't find number_format() that useful in general
[23:06:39] <Blondie101010> good to know
[23:06:50] <__adrian> more useful before intl existed.
[23:07:08] <TML> Stanley: echo ($num > 0 ? '+':''), $num;
[23:07:25] <Stanley> TML anyways, i'm not sure what the argument is here; I'm telling you the docs there don't make sense to me and you're trying to argue that they should. I have no foot in this game, I was simply sharing my opinion
[23:07:33] <TML> Stanley: I'm not arguing
[23:07:41] <TML> Stanley: I am trying to help you
[23:08:01] <Stanley> that's actually similar to my original question before someone told me to use sprintf
[23:08:01] <Stanley> lol
[23:08:10] <Stanley> [11:06:04] Stanley: Is there a cleaner way other than $number > 0 ? '+'.$number : '-'.$number ?
[23:08:17] <__adrian> similar, but doesn't result in "-0"
[23:08:21] <Stanley> yeah
[23:08:22] <__adrian> or "--1"
[23:08:32] <TML> Stanley: I neever said the docs _should_ make sense, I am fully aware that the docs are not perfect. I simply asked you to explain what parts you're struggling with.
[23:08:36] <__adrian> it's fine, i'd just prefer sprintf() myself
[23:08:40] <Simplar> So what do I do about CORS Preflight Did Not Succeed?
[23:08:59] <Stanley> TML Yeah, but when I did explain you told me that I was wrong and asked if I was even reading them, heh
[23:09:12] <Blondie101010> Stanley:  it's simple: https://3v4l.org/hNVKQ
[23:09:17] <TML> Simplar: That's not a PHP thing, that's a browser thing. Here's some Mozilla docs that might help: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSPreflightDidNotSucceed
[23:09:29] <da_wunder> Simplar: you need to enable cors for your site
[23:09:35] <Stanley> @__adrian honestly, sprintf seems like the cleaner option, i'm not against using it, i'm happy to learn, i was honestly just mentioning the docs for it in passing
[23:09:45] <TML> Stanley: I never said you were wrong, I asked a "finding out" question to see what kind of reading you are doing
[23:09:51] <Blondie101010> Stanley: play with my example
[23:09:53] <da_wunder> Simplar: this should help you - https://enable-cors.org/
[23:09:55] <__adrian> sure
[23:10:04] <__adrian> it's not a problem to mention the docs
[23:10:28] <Stanley> TML sorry I was just caught up on
[23:10:29] <Stanley> [11:32:17] +TML: if you read the actual words between the examples they explain that
[23:10:34] <TML> Stanley: You should try re-reading my conversation WITHOUT assuming I'm being combative
[23:10:38] <Blondie101010> they do
[23:10:39] <__adrian> the whole convo around that was exploring which part(s) you thought needed improvement
[23:10:46] <Blondie101010> but it is a complex format
[23:11:28] <Stanley> TML I think I let that last message I shared set your tone
[23:11:42] <TML> Stanley: I feel like that's a true statement - if you read the plain text paragraph, it explains that it's trying to show how to get the same output when writing things in a different way
[23:12:07] <TML> "We now have a problem. The order of the placeholders in the format string does not match the order of the arguments in the code. "
[23:12:34] <Blondie101010> ouch
[23:12:49] <Stanley> That makes more sense when you understand printf, lol
[23:13:16] <Blondie101010> Stanley:  did you play with my example on 3v4l?
[23:14:26] <Stanley> Blondie101010 yes it works perfect thanks! Toyed around with it to get the right after the decimal and it's working exactly as needed
[23:14:35] <TML> Stanley: I'm not arguing with your assertion, I'm asking you to explain what part of that doesn't make sense without understanding printf. And I'm trying to understand if it's just the code examples, or the long-form text that is confusing you.
[23:15:10] <TML> you said you were having trouble explaining what you didn't understand
[23:15:26] <TML> I tried to narrow it down - just the code and the output, or also the English words?
[23:15:42] <Simplar> da_wunder: I did this on Apache level now, and getting same cors preflight issue
[23:15:52] <Simplar> cors in ff dev tools:
[23:15:55] <Simplar> Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
[23:16:04] <Simplar> It's in Response Headers
[23:16:11] <Simplar> so it sees the header
[23:17:25] <da_wunder> Simplar: you might need to also define allowed headers
[23:17:39] <TML> Stanley: I am not interested in an argument about whether people _should_ or _should not_ "just read the examples"; that's akin to a religious argument. I know our docs don't do a great job helping the people who tend to be example-driven, and I know that _I_ am not the correct kind of writer to help an example-driven reader
[23:17:52] <biberu> Simplar: does the request include credentials?
[23:18:51] <TML> Simplar: if you can share the URL you're passing your request to, we might be able to see something in the headers that we can point you to
[23:19:18] <Simplar> It's on localhost tho.
[23:19:18] <da_wunder> ^
[23:19:27] <Simplar> I can try somehow rebroadcast it
[23:20:07] <biberu> Simplar: does your browser support cors against localhost?
[23:20:33] <Simplar> Why shouldn't Firefox do it?
[23:21:06] <TML> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * doesn't match localhost for some browsers
[23:21:12] <TML> not sure if Firefox is on that list
[23:21:22] <biberu> i'm not sure if ff allows that, would look it up
[23:22:35] <da_wunder> or just try some other browser and see if the same issue exists
[23:23:19] <biberu> and it's probably better to be explicit about the origin, * doesn't work for requests that include credentials, and suggest that you're allowing everything rather than looking at the request origin (something you probably don't want to do)
[23:23:25] <TML> Chrome for sure doesn't match * against localhost
[23:23:30] <biberu> Simplar ^
[23:23:58] <Simplar> So I should specify exactly the url of my app?
[23:24:01] <TML> it's a decade-old WontFix bug in Chromium - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67743

[23:29:44] <echoSMILE> oh, and my issue is about odbc_fetch_array, not mysql_*
[23:30:20] <echoSMILE> TML: right, but at this point is not po$$ible to migrate to another php version.
[23:31:39] <Blondie101010> isn't your problem with how you handle your DB queries?  so fix it
[23:31:57] <Simplar> It shows Origin http://localhost:3001 exactly
[23:32:10] <Simplar> so my specified origin exactly matches the cors allowed origin
[23:32:24] <TML> echoSMILE: the answer to your question is "No"
[23:32:44] <Blondie101010> Simplar: try to replace localhost for 127.0.0.1 to see if it makes a difference

[23:35:28] <TML> I can't say I've ever run any tests against a localhost httpd, so there's not a lot I can offer
[23:35:47] <TML> nor have I ever heard of this axios thing
[23:35:58] <da_wunder> Simplar: most likely you need to allow that `Authorization` header for CORS requests
[23:36:24] <Simplar> Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, x-xsrf-token, x_csrftoken, Cache-Control, X-Requested-With
[23:36:27] <Simplar> So it's allowed
[23:37:32] <da_wunder> ok, so then I would first try to disable cors totally - and see if that same still happens
[23:37:58] <da_wunder> we don't see what your full request is so it's quite hard to pin pint the problem
[23:38:50] <da_wunder> and we don't know what you're using on backend - php side - so there might be some middleware's or something else than can cause that
[23:40:24] <Simplar> da_wunder: Guaranteedly no middleware, the object is retrieved directly from $_POST
[23:40:31] <TML> Simplar: you're sending an Authorization header in the request?

[23:43:11] <Simplar> No console image on it? Wow. I can redo that on imgur
[23:43:22] <TML> oh, you're trying to send an image?
[23:43:31] <TML> I don't use a GUI
[23:44:01] <Simplar> It's an image, a complete list of request headers of what i am sending
[23:44:22] <TML> I use a text console, not a windowing system
[23:44:29] <TML> I cannot easily view images
[23:44:59] <TML> But if you're sending an Authorization header, I thought I'd ask if you did a Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header
[23:46:20] <Simplar> In Response, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
[23:46:34] <TML> ok - just something I thought of
[23:47:24] *** Quits: guidoc (~guido@151.43.92.208) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[23:48:25] <TML> my suggestion would be to put together a Dockerfile that builds an httpd setup that will allow people to replicate your issue locally
[23:50:44] <TML> or maybe one of these fine individuals who regularly use a GUI will see something in your images
