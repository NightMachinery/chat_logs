[16:28:57] <xq> so I'm looking at various options of how to pass some info to a (perl) service at startup in the most secure way
[16:29:16] <Festive_Dragon> probably an environment variable
[16:29:21] <xq> one option is to send it to the stdin of the service at startup
[16:29:37] <Yaakov> Credentials?
[16:29:39] <xq> Festive_Dragon: environment of a process can be read
[16:29:44] <xq> Yaakov: something like that, yes
[16:29:50] <Festive_Dragon> xq: so can the memory, if you can read the environment
[16:30:08] <Festive_Dragon> so a better question is what is your target to protect it
[16:30:14] <xq> I would say that the barrier of entry to read the memory is a little higher
[16:30:34] <Yaakov> xq: In the past, I stored them in a file, encrypted, and had the secret in the program code, which decrypted and used them.
[16:30:58] <Festive_Dragon> xq: both require root / ownership of the proc ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:31:13] <Yaakov> I used a simple one time pad style encryption.

[16:35:56] <Botje> xq: how paranoid are you?
[16:36:33] <xq> Festive_Dragon: memory contents can be erased/overwritten after the sensitive data has been used, can /proc/$$/environ contents ?
[16:36:35] <Botje> and what does your environment look like
[16:36:44] <tirnanog> xq: your speaking of stdin reminds me of bubblewrap, which provides --args FD to "parse nul-separated arguments from the given file descriptor".
[16:36:53] <Festive_Dragon> xq: IIRC theres a way to change the system environment
[16:37:06] <Festive_Dragon> set it to an empty string
[16:37:11] <tirnanog> as for /proc/$$/environ in linux, unsetting an environment variable in the perl process will not make it disappear from the environ file, though it will, of course, stop it from being exportable to sub-processes.
[16:37:30] <tirnanog> hmm, an empty string. trying that.
[16:37:37] *** Quits: semeion (~semeion@user/semeion) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[16:37:42] <Botje> xq: for example, if you are in control of spawning the process, putting the credentials on a pipe that the process inherits is one solution.
[16:38:02] <tirnanog> nope. doesn't work.
[16:38:06] <Festive_Dragon> aww
[16:38:08] <tirnanog> nor does undef.
[16:38:29] <tirnanog> so, if it's a toss up between the environment and reading from a file descriptor, the latter has an edge.
[16:38:35] <Botje> I've seen that pattern a few times. ./program --secrets-fd 3 
[16:38:41] <tirnanog> yeah, I like it.
[16:39:04] <Botje> xq: if that is not an option, unix socket with ident to make sure only your process' pid can connect
[16:39:14] <tirnanog> in the case of brwrap, it just uses the fd(s) as a source of additional arguments for its existing argument parsers, but same principle.

[16:51:24] <Botje> that phmgnt thing appears to be a vpn service with no way to report abuse.
[16:51:24] <Yaakov> After a bunch of faffing about, MacPorts maybe be successfully reinstalling my ports. Yay.
[16:51:31] <daemon> \o/
[16:51:43] <Festive_Dragon> Botje: thats fine I can make it annoying to use easily
[16:52:12] <daemon> Botje, xenu I would just say to leave +r on permanently, that is really the standard on IRC 
[16:52:46] <xenu> the problem with +r is that it causes poor UX, irc really wasn't designed for that and it confuses newbies
[16:53:11] <daemon> almost every channel on here is +r, you can always make an overflow channel 
[16:53:34] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[16:53:39] <Yaakov> xenu: The same could be said of me.
[16:53:43] <xenu> i wish people would just get a login form when they try to join a channel with +r
[16:53:46] <tirnanog> there are plenty of channels that don't specify it, so as not to reduce engagement and/or confuse people (particularly newbies).
[16:53:52] <Yaakov> xenu: Well, something similar, that is.
[16:54:04] <xq> +z ?
[16:54:14] *** Quits: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:54:16] <daemon> xenu, you could make that happen ~ kinda you could make the overflow channel +m and have a bot message anyone who gets sent there an explanation of what happened
[16:54:18] <daemon> and how to fix it
[16:54:33] <Festive_Dragon> it is slightly annoying ux
[16:54:38] <Festive_Dragon> xq: +z doesnt work with +r
[16:54:44] <Festive_Dragon> it'd have to be +q $~a
[16:54:56] <Festive_Dragon> and thats even more confusing with users
[16:55:04] <Yaakov> Our "friend" did harken back to "classic" IRC. A blast form the past.
[16:57:19] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[16:57:20] <daemon> really :o classic irc brings back 1000s of bot strongs floods
[16:57:32] <daemon> in alternating colour coded unitext max_line_len strings
[16:57:39] <daemon> that made peoples irc clients hit cpumax
[16:58:10] <daemon> because of the load of the irc client to to render them at a 1000 lines a second and such
[16:58:33] <daemon> that and using said bots to exhause the sendq to clients so the server kicked them anyway
[17:00:14] <pragma-> Festive_Dragon: At one point I had a bot for a +z +q $a channel that would check if the speaker was registered and /msg them "You must be registered to speak in #channel" if not.
[17:00:33] <Festive_Dragon> no need to check if registered, let the server do that for you
[17:00:41] <Festive_Dragon> check if the target channel is @#channelname
[17:01:45] <pragma-> Festive_Dragon: But the +z lets the messages go past the +q $a and the end-users can't tell their messages aren't actually going through.
[17:02:03] <pragma-> Unless that was updated on this network.
[17:02:06] <Festive_Dragon> yes, but the bot doesnt need to spend time checking if regged, is my point
[17:02:08] *** Joins: jplesnik (~jplesnik@83.240.62.176)
[17:02:18] <Festive_Dragon> it can just check if the PRIVMSG it got was to @#channel
[17:02:21] <Festive_Dragon> rather than just #channel
[17:02:25] <pragma-> Right.
[17:02:42] <xenu> the worst part about registering is that it's not obvious at all how to do it
[17:02:55] <pragma-> But it has to differentiate between users that are banned or muted and users that are unregistered.
[17:03:26] <Festive_Dragon> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:03:35] <Festive_Dragon> also account-tag
[17:03:40] <xenu> imagine you're a newbie and your first contact with irc is via this: https://web.libera.chat/

[17:04:48] <pragma-> It'd be nice if the ircd or services would have better error messages instead.
[17:04:59] * pragma- squints at UnregServ.
[17:05:04] <Festive_Dragon> there is no message presented with +z because the message was redirected
[17:05:07] <Festive_Dragon> it wasnt stopped
[17:05:19] <Festive_Dragon> and account-tag can indicate on every message if someone is logged in or not
[17:07:08] <pragma-> er, s/+q $a/+q $~a/g
[17:07:37] <Festive_Dragon> if you dont have z you get the standard ERR_CANTSENDTOCHAN reply
[17:07:53] <pragma-> Which doesn't say anything about being unregistered.
[17:08:13] <Festive_Dragon> well no, because we dont know anything about why someone couldnt speak at that point :P
[17:08:26] <pragma-> But it could!
[17:08:43] <Festive_Dragon> not if it remains modular and maintains a distinction between layers
[17:08:59] <Festive_Dragon> you could forward a reason though, I guess
[17:09:13] <Festive_Dragon> feel free to PR into solanum :P
[17:11:52] <Festive_Dragon> also note; not every client reads the message past the numeric
[17:11:54] <Festive_Dragon> which gets weird

[22:02:48] <aquanight> I was ready for today to be more brutality, but thankfully no. I'm still waiting for them to hit me with modular logarithms.
[22:03:02] <Botje> wonder if you cannot just use manhattan distance to identify groups of beacons.
[22:03:30] <aquanight> I think that is the theory behind most people's solutions
[22:03:47] <Botje> because that is invariant to axis order or orientation
[22:03:48] <aquanight> though they use euclidean
[22:04:00] <Botje> or that.
[22:04:20] <aquanight> well, more likely they used square-of-euclidean
[22:04:38] <aquanight> but that's not that much different
[22:05:28] <Botje> you don't have a pointy square root to hurt yourself on
[22:05:52] <aquanight> but yeah. When I read the part about the sensors being all rotated I ended up burning most of the day and brainpower on building the 24 rotations
[22:06:18] <Botje> oof
[22:06:31] <Botje> back to researching kafka
[22:06:35] <aquanight> largely because I kept trying to be super clever by defining them as products of basic X, Y, or Z rotations.
[22:07:30] <Botje> ah yes
[22:07:49] <Botje> face-first into gimbal lock
[22:08:37] <aquanight> and all because I wanted to do this using affine transformations
[22:09:03] <aquanight> I already ranted about one lost > fucking up my matrix-multiplication function
[22:09:22] <aquanight> because it decided to subtract array references rather than dereference with an index like I wanted

[22:09:35] <aquanight> the cruel difference between $x->[4] and $x-4
[22:09:37] <aquanight> er
[22:09:40] <aquanight> the cruel difference between $x->[4] and $x-[4]
[22:10:13] <aquanight> sweval: my $x = [ 11 .. 20 ]; [ $x->[4], $x-[4] ] # Why is this a thing.
[22:10:15] <perlbot> aquanight: [15,666992]
[22:10:25] <LeoNerd> aquanight: Because people haven't given me a spelling to turn it off yet
[22:10:36] <LeoNerd> no numification; use strict 'numbers'; ... something?
[22:10:37] <aquanight> use stricter 'refs';
[22:11:02] <aquanight> use less 'annoying-misfeatures';
[22:11:10] <LeoNerd> fewer
[22:11:28] <LeoNerd> Well,.. unless you want the same number of misfeatures but have them be less annoying
[22:11:32] <aquanight> no feature 'ref-conversions';
[22:12:04] <aquanight> since, you know, for some reason we're not allowed to add things to strict
[22:12:34] <aquanight> but honestly
[22:12:40] <aquanight> actually
[22:12:52] <aquanight> maybe there's a warning category we can put this under
[22:13:11] <aquanight> the problem is not so much numification as it is doing math on references with no overloaded operator
[22:13:24] <aquanight> 0+$ref probably still has legitimate uses
[22:13:47] *** Joins: krako[m] (~krakozaur@2001:470:69fc:105::1:c0c)
[22:14:07] <aquanight> so what if we said that other than the 0 + scenario, doing numeric operations on a reference triggers an "Argument isn't numeric" warning?
[22:14:12] <xenu> why it can't be a warning? i remember we had a converstation about this
[22:14:19] <aquanight> then the spelling is: use warnings FATAL => 'numeric';
[22:14:44] <xenu> oh, you thought about the same thing
[22:15:42] <aquanight> hmmm
[22:15:56] <krako[m]> Hi everyone !
[22:16:03] <aquanight> sweval: my $x = []; my $sx = "$x"; my $q = $sx / 47; [ $q ]
[22:16:04] <perlbot> aquanight: Argument "ARRAY(0x55a18702f048)" isn't numeric in division (/) at (IRC) line 1. [0]
[22:16:19] <aquanight> why couldn't it work like that?
[22:16:56] <aquanight> if people still want it they can have: do { no warnings 'numeric'; 0 + $ref }
[22:17:16] <aquanight> or maybe 0 + $ref can be special-cased to not warn
[22:17:25] <aquanight> since that's pretty much the "explicit conversion" idiom
[22:18:06] <aquanight> also obviously objects with overloads do their own things
[22:18:10] <xenu> yeah, 0+ref should be special cased, also probably use as a hash key (for stringification)
[22:18:16] <aquanight> hmmm
[22:18:25] <xenu> $foo{$ref} is a common idiom
[22:22:12] <aquanight> package TypoSafeArray { use overload '-' => \&dosub, fallback => 0; sub dosub { my ($l, $r) = @_; ref($r) eq "ARRAY" or die; return $l->[$r->[0]]; } }

[22:24:04] <aquanight> LeoNerd: I would've liked to O:P that but I wasn't sure about blessing random arrays into O:P classes even if I'm not using any fields.
[22:24:41] <xenu> oh sorry, there are more posts, but they aren't "hot"
[22:25:14] <aquanight> sweval: package TypoSafeArray { use overload '-' => \&dosub, fallback => 0; sub dosub { my ($l, $r) = @_; ref($r) eq "ARRAY" or die; return $l->[$r->[0]]; } }; my $x = bless [ 11 .. 20 ], "TypoSafeArray"; [ $x->[4], $x-[4] ];
[22:25:15] <perlbot> aquanight: [15,15]
[22:25:19] <aquanight> muahahaha
[22:25:28] <aquanight> the only problem is I can't fix $x-@[2, 3, 4]
[22:25:41] <aquanight> but I don't think that will legally parse
[22:25:55] <aquanight> also it doesn't work as well with hashes
