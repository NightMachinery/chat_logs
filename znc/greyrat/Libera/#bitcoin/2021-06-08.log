[01:32:22] <Evolver> Bitcoin price is down. How on earth was the US govt able to seize a great chunk of the ransomware payment? As an investor, it puts the reputation of Bitcoin into question if the US can just seize it as they please.
[01:32:32] <Evolver> so I'm asking here from a cybersecurity pov
[01:38:49] <bugs_> all i see is that a court order was issued
[01:39:04] <bugs_> i haven't seen a txid yet :-)
[01:39:30] <Chex> Evolver: lol, pretty sure the US Gov has p0wned bitcoin for a while now
[01:40:34] <belcher> Evolver by my reading the coins were sent to "a wallet in california" which could just be coinbase.com or something, so maybe the hacker was trying to sell them lol
[01:40:54] <earnestly> The US government likely owned the wallet
[01:40:55] <Evolver> errr they would be sent to Coinbase to recover them for Colonial
[01:41:01] <belcher> same old not-your-keys-not-your-coins
[01:41:19] <Evolver> No hacker would sell them on Coinbase
[01:41:33] <belcher> crazy to think isnt it
[01:41:58] <Evolver> I am just trying to grasp how the seizure even happened, assuming it happened, although bugs_ isn't convinced that it did.
[01:41:59] <earnestly> cyberpandemic simulation -> oh, random infrastructure pipeline attack -> 1 meelion dollars *mr evil* -> better fund nord stream 2
[01:42:18] <belcher> that they're supposedly competent enough to deploy ransomware to a pipeline but incompetent enough to try to sell them on coinbase (though i know ransomware is often run by all different kinds of people selling access so it might be different people involved)
[01:42:33] <earnestly> None of it makes sense
[01:43:45] <Evolver> and that's why the price fell. That's the consequence of it not making sense

[05:48:18] <BUSY> Evolver, what about a physical good, as currency, such as a tesla car or donut?
[05:48:51] <BUSY> did the guy who traded up from a red paperclip to a house pay taxes on his asset bartering?
[05:49:55] <Evolver> BUSY: if you just send crypto to someone, then no, you don't owe anyone any income taxes on it. However, if you were on the receiving end, and say you sell your received crypto for USD, then you've to writeoff your business expenses for the donut
[05:50:30] <Evolver> BUSY: so if it cost me $2 to make the donut, and I sold my received crypto for $3, then I will owe taxes on $1

[15:14:50] <earnestly> belcher: I found that it's necessary for an address to be "solvable" as otherwise it cannot determine the fees (this error is probably a red herring though)
[15:15:14] <earnestly> Because the same error is displayed even if fees are manually set
[15:15:46] <belcher> i think that does make sense, because to calculate the fees the wallet must know the total size of the tx, which depends on how big the signature is (for example, if the address is multisig it will be larger and require more fees, but the address redeemscript must be known for that to be calculated)
[15:15:47] <earnestly> (it being a watch-only wallet)
[15:15:58] <belcher> seems like it is a bug if the error is still there even if fees are manually set
[15:16:10] <earnestly> Yeah it does make sense, the error though is a bit unclear
[15:17:59] <earnestly> belcher: You can try creating a walletcreatefundedpbst with a watch-only wallet that only imported an address, I would get an error about it being unable to determine the fee when using subtractfeefromoutputs, fee_rate, feeRate, etc.  It would result in the same message explaining how it couldn't determine the fees
[15:19:35] <belcher> earnestly can you open an issue on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/ ?
[15:19:40] <earnestly> I assume these two error conditions just happen to sure the same error path
[15:19:43] <belcher> or later, right now some CND is broken
[15:19:54] <earnestly> Yeah I noticed much of the internet breaking, lol
