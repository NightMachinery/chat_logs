[01:10:50] <dadinn> I have client-to-client option in server.conf

[01:40:05] <dadinn> _val_: these are clients in different LANs behind CGNATs so they can only communicate through VPN. I already have another VPN server which through which they can communicate. I am in the middle of migrating to the new server at a new VPS provider, and even though seemingly everything is the same the clients cannot communicate
[01:40:31] *** Quits: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:42:40] <BtbN> Yes, but are they on the same network in the VPN? Or some net
[01:42:43] <BtbN> *net30
[01:43:33] <dadinn> _val_: on both clients `ip addr` shows the tun interface, and both has the reserved ip allocated to them on the server ccd
[01:44:45] <dadinn> BtbN: not sure what net30 is :/
[01:45:08] <BtbN> The default topology openvpn uses. Each client in its own /30 with the server
[01:46:00] <dadinn> BtbN: topology is set to subnet
[01:46:29] <BtbN> With client-to-client, there's no reason other than the clients own firewall then
[01:46:42] <dadinn> server 10.10.0.0 255.255.255.0
[01:47:45] <dadinn> BtbN: but it the clients are connected to the other server on another tun interface at 10.8.0.0/24 address
[01:48:34] <dadinn> BtbN: I mean they are connected to the old server fine, there are no problems there... so I would expect it should work on the new one too
[01:49:30] <dadinn> the new server uses topology subnet, and client-to-client
[01:49:58] <dadinn> as I said the clients seem to connect to the server fine, but cannot communicate with each other
[01:50:08] <rob0> --client-to-client simply means openvpn routes client-to-client packets internally.  If you want to limit/firewall any of that, you don't want it.
[01:50:32] <dadinn> I am also not able to ping 10.10.0.1, which I would expect to be the server
[01:50:39] <Poster> also make sure that there is sufficient routing in place to the network(s) that clients are assigned
[01:51:17] <dadinn> the server VPS has some firewall, and I had to enable 1194/udp manually
[01:51:47] <rob0> 10.10 or 10.8?  You have two server instances?  Are they on the same VPS?
[01:52:46] <dadinn> rob0: 10.10 is a VPS, 10.8 is a desktop machine with public ip.
[01:53:57] <rob0> dadinn | server 10.10.0.0 255.255.255.0
[01:55:12] <dadinn> rob0: that's in the server.conf yes
[01:55:20] <rob0> separate, oh.  You do have two, but not on the same VM/machine.
[01:55:52] <rob0> I guess each one is going to need to know how to route to the other's VPN.
[01:56:15] <dadinn> rob0: nope, I am migrating over. the desktop was oly for testing
[01:56:21] <dadinn> * only
[01:56:32] <dadinn> POC
[01:57:43] <rob0> yes, 10.10.0.1 would be the server's VPN IP.  If you can't ping it from a client, why not?  Not connected?  Firewall on one side or the other?
[01:59:43] <dadinn> rob0: I can't ping the VPS directly, possibly because of the firewall... which I think is fine
[02:00:01] <dadinn> but I would expect that pinging 10.10.0.1 should still work
[02:00:54] <BtbN> But OpenVPN did connect successfully?
[02:01:46] <dadinn> BtbN: it did. `ip addr` shows the addr I allocated for the clients specifically.
[02:02:35] <rob0> so a Linux client connected to a Linux server
[02:03:05] <BtbN> it's odd. With client-to-client enabled, and both connected successfully, the only reason why they can't talk to each other must be on either of the clients.
[02:03:18] <BtbN> The Servers IP Stack never sees communication between the two
[02:03:55] <dadinn> BtbN: how would I test if that's the case?

[02:04:07] <BtbN> Not sure what you mean?
[02:06:25] <dadinn> I am stuck with why the ping is not working. Even though the VPS block direct ping by public ip, the 10.10.0.1 address should still work, no?
[02:07:39] <BtbN> depends entirely on the Firewall config in place

[02:19:22] <dadinn> khm, it seems the problem might be with the comp_lzo option
[02:20:44] <BtbN> That seems fairly unlikely. It just needs to be the same everywhere (and is generally a good idea to turn off, but it should not break stuff)
[02:21:09] <dadinn> i have "comp-lzo no" in both clients, but there is no such option on the server :/
[02:27:13] <BtbN> It should be set to the same everywhere

[02:49:11] <dadinn> BtbN: ok, it seems after adding "comp-lzo no" on the server.conf too, now I can ping the server
[02:50:37] <BtbN> I'm surprised it even connected successfully.
[02:54:09] <dadinn> another problem I seem to have is with systemd, when I am trying to restart the service it seems to try to ask for the passphrase, but then nothing happens... before I couldn't tell if it was working or not, but now the ping doesn't work either
[02:54:19] <dadinn> I can only run openvpn manually
[02:54:26] <dadinn> I mean the server
[02:55:40] <dadinn> also if I restart the systemd servire multiple times, I occasionally get a prompt to type in the passhrase, but then I keep getting broadcast messages about 'Password entry required'
[02:58:06] <dadinn> I've now tried this systemd-tty-ask-password-agent and could type the passphrase... but this is a PITA. Is this how it supposed to work?
[03:10:46] <dadinn> I assume if I remove the passphrase from the server key that would be solve the problem. The question is what are the potential problems of not having passphrase on the key?
