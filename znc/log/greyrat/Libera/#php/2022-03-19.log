[00:19:25] <teresko> da_wunder: also related - https://www.monkeyuser.com/2018/going-global/
[00:20:12] <da_wunder> teresko: so true
[00:22:38] <Sammitch> I think the worst one I've seen was an event scheduling site that required you to enter the date/time in UTC, and helpfully told your your UTC offset, but was completely silent about you scheduling things across DST transitions
[00:23:26] <Sammitch> apparently the whole "why are these events an hour off sometimes?" problem went on for _years_ before I heard about it.
[00:25:47] <da_wunder> Sammitch: we've had that one hour mismatch last two weeks with m$ teams and google calendar
[00:26:23] <da_wunder> for some people times are correct, but but for another people there is 1 hour offset
[00:26:32] <da_wunder> and that is like 50/50
[00:26:46] <Sammitch> some people using UTC offset vs specifying a timezone?
[00:27:46] <Sammitch> just wait until the US gets rid of DST, but no one updates their tzdata >:3c
[00:27:46] <da_wunder> and in the same time, also we noticed that not all m$ teams event wasn't created/updated to google calendar
[00:29:04] <da_wunder> and really those both problems are totally randon, eg. I've meetings with correct and incorrect times + those missing meetings totally - and all those was created by same customer user - so it's totally random
[00:30:12] <TML> Sammitch: it's a known issue, fixed in https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=80974
[00:30:20] <Sammitch> you'd be surprised how many people turn off NTP on their devices and set the time manually, which causes fun issues
[00:31:20] <Sammitch> TML: the dates being computed have matching TZs though
[00:31:34] <da_wunder> Sammitch: but that doesn't explain that those issues are from same person, who made those meetings in same day...
[00:31:59] <Sammitch> da_wunder: different devices, differnt wrong time configs :P
[00:32:52] <da_wunder> and there was like one minute between those events - we asked - he did those on same device and literally create events was like ~1 minute span...
[00:32:54] <Sammitch> TML: also I added America/Vancouver as an additional test, and _that_ TZ worked normally
[00:33:36] <Sammitch> there's a patch in there about Amsterdam, but it only references a missing transition from 1996...
[00:36:00] <Sammitch> da_wunder: honestly I would just tell that guy to check that NTP is enabled on his devices, and that the timezone is set correctly.
[00:37:14] <da_wunder> Sammitch: we have had similar issues like that with ~50+ people on our company last two weeks - so I think that m$ or google or both are just doing something weird
[00:37:21] <Sammitch> but some people are insane, like "I need my phone to sync with my car's clock, so I turned off NTP and manually adjust the time every week since the car's clock drifts like Fast and Furious 3"
[00:38:06] <da_wunder> because we've had teams + google sync like that for years without problems, and suddenly this happens
[00:38:12] <Sammitch> da_wunder: my money is on MS. say what you will about google, but they tend to aggressively adhere to standards, while MS aggressively ignores them.
[00:38:55] <da_wunder> might be, but that doesn't explain that why just _some_ people on those same meetings are having that problem
[00:39:43] <da_wunder> and that I mean people in same organization, eg. I have those right sometimes and my co-worker doesn't and vice versa - it's totally random
[00:40:47] <Sammitch> gather evidence, determine conditions, construct repro, report to appropriate service provider :P
[00:41:04] <da_wunder> we've done that already week ago...
[00:41:08] <da_wunder> no answer...
[00:42:58] <Sammitch> but you keep saying "sometimes" and "randomly" which implies you don't know the conditions or how to reproduce the issue, which means that support can't either.
[00:47:21] <TML> Sammitch: I must have not read the code closely enough, sorry
[00:47:26] <da_wunder> and we have sent all the information we've about that
[00:47:58] <TML> could simply be a tzdb update embedded in the patch
[00:48:26] <Sammitch> TML: the asker's code is kind of a nightmare, which is why I rewrote it for my answer. but it kind of feels like a corner case of pre-8.1 Date bugs
[00:48:36] <Sammitch> also possible

[01:10:21] <Hash> Diablo 2 modding app that I wrote in php with the only problem others give me greif about is accepting GET vars and putting vars directly in SQL
[01:10:42] <Hash> But it's a local app, not networked or listening to outside. I just didn't care. I could update the code to use that, but whatever.
[01:11:00] <Hash> I don't know. Was fun. Coded the full Diablo 2 item system in php, which was fun.
[01:11:09] <Hash> https://gitlab.com/hashborgir/d2tools/-/blob/master/src/D2ItemDesc.php here's that one
[01:11:32] <TML> Hash: Glad you had fun, but I'd strongly encourage you to just make those comments part of your regular habit
[01:11:41] <Hash> Which comments?
[01:11:47] <Hash> The proper sql parametrizing?
[01:12:01] <Hash> Yes for all the other apps. I always do/did. I don't know why I didn't do it for this one
[01:12:42] <Hash> This was/is the only app I just didn't care about. I don't know why. I guess I thought, it's a local app, uses soemthing called PHP Desktop to build for windows, listens on random internal port each time, and it's not open to the outside world.
[01:12:51] <Hash> That's why. But otherwise, yes, I always do that for security reasons.
[01:13:29] <Hash> I want to learn laravel. I think I will port this to laravel next in myf ree time
[01:14:06] <TML> Hash: my recommendation is due to what happens if you forget someday that you baked in that assumption; or someone else gets a hold of your code and doesn't know about that assumption, and exposes the random port to the broader internet via something like UPnP, etc
[01:14:21] <TML> just make it so you never think twice, parameterize everything you write
[01:14:26] <TML> then you never have to worry about it
[01:14:28] <Hash> Yeah, true. Also not all th ecode is crap. Just some bits. I want to make better

[01:17:20] <TML> well, glad you had fun :)
[01:17:34] <TML> For future GUI apps, I'd suggest taking a look at Swift
[01:17:40] <Hash> With php?
[01:17:42] <Hash> I like php
[01:17:47] <TML> a lot of people seem to enjoy it
[01:18:01] <Hash> Is that mac stuff?
[01:18:04] <TML> Hash: No, I would never recommend PHP for "GUI apps"
[01:18:10] <Hash> really?
[01:18:13] <TML> Apple makes Swift, yes
[01:18:28] <Hash> What about php qt or something?3~
[01:18:58] <TML> Hash: I'm simply expressing my opinion - I do not think PHP, as a language, lends itself well to desktop application programming
[01:19:18] <Hash> I have been hearing that for since 2007
[01:19:21] <Hash> :)
[01:19:31] <Hash> I guess. I can retry the app in a diff language.
[01:19:35] <TML> PHP inherently assumes stateless protocols are in use, desktop apps are better written in a stateful manner (IMO)
[01:19:51] <Hash> I need a cross platform gui with some good libs
[01:20:03] <Hash> yeah, you're write
[01:20:11] <Hash> im having to use sessions etc.
[01:20:18] <Hash> right*
[01:20:18] <TML> exactly
[01:20:34] <TML> A good desktop-oriented programming language just handles all of that stuff for you transparently
[01:20:44] <Hash> Ok cool
[01:20:55] <Hash> I got the shot today, I feel woozy
[01:20:56] <TML> Can you write desktop apps in PHP? Sure. Of course. Does that mean PHP is a _good fit_? IMO, not particularly.
[01:20:59] <Hash> First vaccine shot.
[01:21:21] <Hash> Ok well I tried ti and it was pretty cool.
[01:21:25] <Hash> I did have fun :)
[01:21:41] <TML> great! :)
[01:21:44] <TML> that's important, too
[01:21:45] <Hash> https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop I looked how to package it for windows
[01:21:56] <Hash> This came up. So I went with it. No frameworks nothign. Just raw php
[01:22:06] <TML> If you're inclined to take a look sometime, I've been told Swift can target Windows as well as MacOS: https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-on-windows/
[01:22:17] <Hash> It's just easiser to style/position things in html/css than gui apps.
[01:22:27] <TML> Hash: Nah
[01:22:37] <Hash> GUI apps and generating dynamic controls based on data, generating GUIS based on data.
[01:22:39] <TML> You've just not used a good GUI toolkit yet

[01:23:08] <Hash> But that was years and years ago
[01:23:45] <TML> Haxe is "just OK" at a million things, and not particularly good at any of them, IMO
[01:23:49] <TML> never heard of flixel
[01:23:56] <Hash> it's a framework for it

[01:24:26] <Hash> Oh yeah, they make games in it
[01:24:59] <TML> it's worth your time to try out some stuff that is inherently built to make this stuff easy, instead of just toying with stuff that is half-baked solutions forcing a round peg into a square hole
[01:25:09] <TML> IMO, anyway
[01:25:16] <Hash> Recommend something other than Apple please

[01:30:07] <Hash> Thanks guys
[01:30:22] <Hash> I'll let this app go in ph. So far it works and that's fine. No more timnewasting
[01:31:27] <TML> Sammitch: it's possible my spec is older than Derick's, but my bet is that this is a simple oversight - the format section doesn't clearly state the decimal support, you have to read footnote B to see that it's there
[01:31:31] <Albright> Haxe/Flixel is interesting in that it's trying to be an evolution of ActionScript/Flash, but IIRC its dev tools or most recent VM or something weren't Mac-compatible

[20:33:47] <p3rL> hello... i am looking for a way to get client ip address but ipv4 only
[20:34:02] <p3rL> i've tried many public codes all are giving ipv6
[20:34:38] <AllenJB> If your site is running over IPv6, you're going to get an IPv6 client address and getting an IPv4 one is impossible
[20:34:48] <da_wunder> ^
[20:35:00] <p3rL> its running on both
[20:35:27] <AllenJB> Then you're going to get an IPv6 address for IPv6 clients, and an IPv4 address for IPv4 clients
[20:35:57] <p3rL> but what if client have ipv4 also and my sites always giving me ipv6 is there any code/function to get only ipv4
[20:36:00] <p3rL> or both ?
[20:36:28] <AllenJB> No. If the client connects over IPv6, the server has no knowledge of its IPv4 capabilities or IP address
[20:37:10] <p3rL> and how do i know that this server is using ipv4 or ipv6 .. they are giving ipv4 all the time
[20:37:11] <p3rL> curl 208.95.112.1/line/?fields=query
[20:37:39] <AllenJB> Well that's an IPv4 IP address, so it'll be using IPv4
[20:37:58] <p3rL> umm leme try with domain
[20:38:20] <AllenJB> If you're using domain, then it'll depend on DNS records and client preference
[20:38:22] <p3rL> curl -s ip-api.com/line/?fields=query
[20:38:31] <p3rL> still its shows ipv4
[20:38:40] <AllenJB> (assuming the client is capable of both IPv4 and IPv6)
[20:39:51] <p3rL> so i must disable ipv6 http port to get ipv6
[20:39:56] <p3rL> ipv4*
[20:40:47] <AllenJB> That domain only has an A record, no AAAA records, so it will only ever use IPv4 - https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=a%3aip-api.com&run=toolpage
