[05:18:44] <kveroneau> fluffywolf, it will depend on what packages you have installed.  I did a test where I installed Debian 3.0 Woody into a VM with basic XFree86 and I think fvwm, and upgraded all the way up to Debian 10, and it went fairly well with minimal issues.  However, with that said.  If you are not experienced with Debian, and troubleshooting issues, then don't do it.  And before any risky upgrade such as this, be sure to do a back-up first.
[05:19:07] <greycat> dvs: Not risky so much as tedious and time-consuming.
[05:19:13] <fluffywolf> it's a server, with a fairly small set of server packages.
[05:19:36] <greycat> that's generally a good case for upgrades
[05:19:57] <kveroneau> fluffywolf, okay, it may work.  What you could do is create a local VM which mirrors the server, and stage the upgrade in the VM first and make notes along the way.

[05:21:58] <dvs> fluffywolf: you can't backup the server before the upgrade either?
[05:22:03] <kveroneau> fluffywolf, you wouldn't need everything.
[05:22:26] <kveroneau> fluffywolf, but creating a local VM would be a pain with that sort of connection.

[05:39:12] <kveroneau> fluffywolf, well the good news is that if you do wait long enough, I may stop procrastinating and actually make a video showcasing a Debian upgrade from 3.0 Woody up to 10, or maybe 11 now. :D
[05:40:24] <kveroneau> Been wanting to make a video for this for awhile now after trying the upgrade process out.  I think this type of video would be beneficial for the Debian community and take the anxiety away from a typical OS upgrade.
[05:40:25] <fluffywolf> my experience with incremental upgrades is you end up with 11,000 unneeded packages along the way.
[05:41:18] <kveroneau> That is to be expected as packages stop being maintained and leave the repo entirely.

[09:17:15] <tjcarter> I have a hate/hate relationship with systemd myself, but I've resigned to having to live with it because the haters have made it impossible to detect the non-systemd case
[09:17:37] <System_Error> fluffywolf> otoh systemd got some strong points. E.g. debian maintainers improved security of some net services, etc.
[09:17:40] <tjcarter> That means any code should basically not bother with the non-systemd case, because you cannot detect that it exists.
[09:18:02] <tjcarter> System_Error: it cleans up a LOT of init scripts

[09:29:34] <System_Error> basically when it comes to systemd I like their idea, but current implementation turns into something too big and I dont like that
[09:30:21] <tjcarter> It's pretty much my way to mock all that which is delivered from on high and regarded as not subject to question by us mere mortal users. I don't always refuse to use such software … but I think it's important that the people who write it need to learn that they are NOT entitled to their whims being treated as law.
[09:31:45] <tjcarter> Sometimes when people complain systemd is too big, the complaint rings a little hollow because it would actually be bigger to have that function split out and separate. Other times, it definitely rings true. There's certainly some feature creep in there.
[09:33:29] <tjcarter> I look at Apple's launchd and it makes sense to me: Why wouldn't you have a thing that launches processes in response to events or timers, basically making things like cron and inetd obsolete?

[09:35:54] <System_Error> Systemd works without dbus tho. Even in debian.
[09:36:19] <tjcarter> But dbus is intended to be there upstream
[09:37:10] <tjcarter> That's why I'm not sure it belongs there … it feels tacked on and folded in only because upstream wants everything to be part of the monolith.
[09:37:27] <System_Error> How so? It designed by upstream to be "option" if I got it right. Thus systemctl operational on systems without DBUS installed.
[09:37:55] <System_Error> this said systemd got utterly dumb failure mode on dbus systems. Kill dbus and suddenly... WHAT?!

[12:28:24] <Haohmaru> k, imma upgrade to 11 first
[12:28:53] <Haohmaru> would that only affect "textmode" screens?
[12:29:26] <Haohmaru> because basically this is a fullHD monitor with a rotating stand, and i've put it in "portrait" mode
[12:29:37] <jelly> that's for console,  after it swtches from 80x25 huge letters text mode to native resolution
[12:30:06] <Haohmaru> right, so the xorg conf rotation should remain
[12:30:14] <jelly> they're independent
[12:30:27] <jelly> the docs have more info
[12:30:41] <Haohmaru> yeah, i'll rtfm after the upgrade
[12:30:45] <jelly> I've never tried it.
[12:30:58] <Khepra> quite featurefull that fbcon, innit.
[12:31:12] <jelly> if only it was a bit accelerated
[12:31:24] <Haohmaru> accelerated?
[12:31:43] <jelly> instead of redrawing the whole screen when lines are scrolling
[12:32:04] <Haohmaru> hm
[12:32:21] <Khepra> Linus' stance is "nobody is using the console", and the systemd-linus cabal wants to kill it
[12:32:39] <Haohmaru> nobody is using textmode?

[12:32:52] <jelly> fbcon is unusably slow for actual use as a terminal.  Depending on kernel version, if things are writing a lot to it it can slow the whole machine down
[12:33:21] <Haohmaru> is it as bad as windewz's cmd.exe tho?
[12:33:25] <jelly> worse
[12:33:29] <Haohmaru> O_o
[12:33:45] <jelly> command prompt is fast.  Just not a very good terminal
[12:33:50] <Haohmaru> because most GUI terminals in linux are much faster at vomitting tons of text
[12:34:08] <Haohmaru> cmd.exe is dumb, it kinda seems it does blocking drawing
[12:34:18] <jelly> yes.  Running X and xterm in full screen will be much better than fb console
[12:34:34] <Haohmaru> or was it updating after each char is drawn
[12:35:26] <jelly> I only deal with cmd over RDP, can't say much about the performance.  But Windows 10 has a new Terminal app in store, try that if you need it

[12:44:29] <Haohmaru> yet, it is unknown whether the new kernel is gonna work (99.99% it will, but still..)
[12:45:31] <jelly> Haohmaru: don't remove your running kernel.

[12:46:09] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[12:47:09] <Haohmaru> i already upgraded like 3 debians

[20:56:26] <Kobaz> you could
[20:56:42] <Kobaz> that's technically feasible, that feature is supported
[20:56:45] <mihaiadrian> i've been using ubuntu for the last 13 years, played a bit with other distros as well (mainly arch/debian in vm/server) and for the first time since i use linux i decided to make the switch. hopped to some distros (opensuse, fedora, mx linux, flavours of ubuntu) and finally decided to settle on debian.
[20:57:09] <Kobaz> wow i forgot how old ubuntu was
[20:57:19] <Kobaz> definitely been around
[20:57:51] <mihaiadrian> not only is literally the best distro out there, but it's the only one to feel snappy on my aging hardware. with ubuntu, i was getting random freezes for a few seconds when i was doing [cpu/ram/disk/whatever] heavy tasks
[20:58:12] <mihaiadrian> and the fan would work non-stop. tried all fan control programs in the world
[20:58:17] <mihaiadrian> i just couldn't work with all that noise
[20:58:17] <Kobaz> ubuntu has a lot of desktop-ey services running
[20:58:23] <mihaiadrian> i'm extra-extra happy with debian
[20:58:26] <Kobaz> and out of the box some of them randomly crash

[23:53:10] <CarlFK> nfs is external ;)
[23:53:56] <CarlFK> it also works on local disk fs
[23:54:15] <CarlFK> I suspect my problem is network isn't a block device
[23:54:26] <PMT> CarlFK: I'm glad you want to quibble. You will probably successfully convince them to change the description to say "not NFS"

[23:55:17] <PMT> They might even go the extra mile and say "not network filesystems (CephFS, SMB, NFS, AFS, ...)"
[23:55:46] <CarlFK> maybe.  or they might say "huh, never thought of that, let me make it handle that too..."

[23:57:06] <PMT> Possible. But the tool seems very explicitly geared toward "make a live image on a disk persistent", and as you say, NFS is not a disk.
