[00:02:20] <SnoopJ> yates, neither of those is correct. range() returns a range object, which is iterable, but is not itself an iterator. *range() doesn't "return" anything, but it unpacks the range where that syntax can be used.

[00:04:45] <dirtydan> Hi, I need to write a webUI for a home automation project. Very basic, just some buttons. I've looked at Flask, Pyramid, and Django but I'm wondering if this is overkill. Is there a "very basic" web framework I might be better off learning?
[00:05:02] <The-Compiler> dirtydan: Flask sounds like it would fit the bill
[00:05:24] <grym> dirtydan: flask, pyramid, bottle, fastAPI.
[00:05:27] <grym> in no real order
[00:05:28] <The-Compiler> it's about as basic as it gets (yet very extensible)
[00:05:54] <yates> nedbat: this line: self.deletechars=''.join([chr(x) for x in range(0,0x20) + range(0x21, 0x30) + range(0x3a, 0x41) + range(0x5b, 0x61) + range(0x7b, 0xff)])
[00:06:01] <SnoopJ> yates, the expression `f(*it)` means "call the function f with the first thing in the iterable as the first arg, the second thing as the second arg, etc." https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-unpacking-arguments
[00:06:14] <nedbat> yates: ok, but what specifically would you like defined?

[00:07:42] <The-Compiler> and yep, what SnoopJ says

[00:11:06] <nedbat> yates: you can also omit one set of []:   ''.join(chr(x) for x in [*range(0,0x20), *range(0x21, 0x30), *range(0x3a, 0x41), *range(0x5b, 0x61), *range(0x7b, 0xff)])

[00:31:15] <erd0s> is there anything like breakpoint('localhost:1234') to have that debugging work with a remote thingy? (happy to go rtfm just want to sense check it's feasible first :)
[00:32:07] <Wooble> Guest54: the appdirs module will pick a suitable place based on the system for storing a program's files. It's much friendlier than deciding on that place for yourself.

[02:40:12] <SnoopJ> mehwork, it might. Testing is a means to an end, usually to build confidence in the behavior of some code or its integration with other systems.
[02:41:00] <TML> That's a strange delimiter to me - I don't normally think of _code_ as being "production" or "non-production"; that's usually an attribute of the execution environment

[02:41:34] <mehwork> sure, but unit tests are never production, so it seems like there is some delimeters
[02:42:18] <TML> mehwork: We definitely run the unit tests on our production environments as part of the release gating
[02:42:51] <mehwork> TML: why wouldn't the build catch unit test issues before deploying to prod be enough?
[02:43:23] <TML> mehwork: Because some issues don't appear until you run them in the production environment
[02:43:35] <mehwork> doesn't sound like a unit test then

[02:43:57] <mehwork> sounds like an integration test
[02:44:36] <mehwork> i'm probably failing to understand something, but i'm now more confused than before :)
[02:45:04] <SnoopJ> mehwork, the various categories of tests are not by any means very rigid formal concepts. The meanings of a lot of these terms will depend on the opinions of who is using the terms
[02:45:05] <TML> For example, you won't see this often in Python projects, but in Java projects you can have the OSGi container incorrectly hold on to an older version of a bundle, so your unit tests fail, indicating that there's a problem with the way the bundle is being registered that doesn't show up until you reach a long-lived instance like production.

[02:46:58] <mehwork> everything is a means to and end, but how clear the path is should matter, ratehr than just being like "ok, i got here a totally weird and different way than other people on my team"
[02:47:24] <TML> mehwork: For us, the entire test suite is run anytime a single test is run by the tooling. Invdividual devs may run a particular test or suite of tests on their machines without executing the entire harness, but the tooling just executes everything on any release gate.
[02:47:26] <SnoopJ> it matters, but I don't know by what means I can influence the terminology of [everyone else who writes computer programs]

[02:50:54] <mehwork> people will call a blackbox test to an external api server an 'integration test'. I guess there the "integration" is that of the request -> server -> response ?

[02:52:40] <SnoopJ> although in practice you can often avoid the remote dependency if you can simulate a response or whatever

[03:18:19] <tga> SnoopJ: with enums I have to first define values (writing each one _twice_ like FOO = 'foo'), and then put them together in a dict (writing them all the third time)
[03:19:30] <SnoopJ> it sounds like you want to generate one of them from the other, but I'm afraid I still don't understand the task (I don't know how autocompletion relates to the values of a dictionary)

[03:21:18] <tga> SnoopJ: I have a big static dict with configuration values, that then get referenced all over the place. I need to use it as a dict (searching by key) and also fish out values directly (mydict["foo"])
[03:21:47] <tga> SnoopJ: I'm trying to add code completion for the second case
[03:22:34] *** Quits: Masterphi (~Masterphi@user/masterphi) (Quit: Masterphi)
[03:22:38] <tga> the straightforward way is to add an enum with all keys, and an enum with all possible values -- but that's a lot of repeated typing
[03:23:03] <tga> so I was looking for options, maybe there is a dict/enum like data structure that I'm missing
[03:24:01] <SnoopJ> enum.Enum instances have a __members__ attribute that is a read-only mapping of the keys/values defined therein, although the members will be instances of the subclass and will need a little unpacking if you want to get back to exactly what your dict looks like
[03:24:57] <SnoopJ> but I still don't understand how completion on values comes into this, completion of mydict["foo"] would be over the keys, wouldn't it?
[03:25:12] <tga> I do want completion over keys, when I use them directly
[03:25:41] <tga> so my current option is to have a separate enum just listing the keys, and then I can build the dict like {MyEnum.KEY1: [1,2,3]}

[03:26:38] <marduk> You can define a TypedDict
[03:27:23] <SnoopJ> ah yea, TypedDict would be useful for the keys part of this. No idea how it intersects with the values part, which is a mystery to me.
[03:27:43] <SnoopJ> substantially simpler than messing around with Enum's implementation
[03:28:56] <tga> TypedDict is nice -- it doesn't reduce the code I have to write, but definitely nice to have
[03:29:09] <tga> it prevents someone not knowing about the key enum and using a regular string
[03:29:40] <tga> the values part is the same deal, all values come from a fixed set, and I'd like to have completion  when used directly
[03:30:02] <tga> {KeyEnum.FOO: [ValueEnum.BAR, ValueEnum.BAZ]} kind of deal
[03:31:01] <tga> no way around defining the bag of values I guess

[08:07:31] <TML> blei: That's just line noise here
[08:07:35] <voldial> TML: I understand (now), but really, the example would be easier to grok if it was pointed out that i2-i1 must be 3
[08:07:42] <blei> TIL TML == RMS

[08:08:27] <TML> and I don't eat the stuff that falls off my feet, either
[08:08:32] <BrenBarn> voldial: why do you think that i2-i1 must be 3?
[08:08:54] <voldial> BrenBarn: because it's a range getting 3 bytes assinged to it?

[08:09:23] <TML> voldial: …no
[08:09:29] <BrenBarn> do you realize that `b'...'` in that example is also supposed to be a stand-in for "any bytestring here", and not the literal string `"..."

[08:12:36] <BrenBarn> do you understand what it means to show a template rather than showing a single concrete example?
[08:13:01] <BrenBarn> it's like the difference between saying the pythagorean theorem is a^2+b^2=c^2 and saying 9+16=25
[08:13:12] <voldial> yes, but the template is unecessary when trivial changes make the snippit valid code
[08:13:19] <TML> voldial: Well, I am not trying to convince you to like it, just trying to help you understand it. :)
[08:13:34] <BrenBarn> no, because the template shows the pattern of what you can do, not just one particular thing you can do
[08:13:43] <voldial> it's all good, I get it
[08:14:02] <TML> voldial: The python documentation, by and large, does not include runnable examples in-line; so it's unlikely it will be changed here. :D
[08:14:23] <voldial> BrenBarn: it's easier to inferr the pattern from the exact example "_[0:2] = b'..' sets the first two bytes to 0x2E"

[13:14:14] <no_gravity> amogorkon: Telling the developers to run it is way too opressive. I for one would never do that.
[13:14:27] <amogorkon> if you use vscode, just use the plugin
[13:14:27] <no_gravity> amogorkon: And running it in a CI pipeline will cause mass confusion.

If I was just adding a websocket endpoint for clients to connect to, seems like most frameworks can handle that. Because serving the HTTP route at /test and the

[18:52:18] <pragmaticenigma> I'm having difficulty understanding a behavior with this class: https://bpa.st/RGMWPTHAL27RK22PHVNTHBQETE  .  When I create a second instance of that class, I somehow receive the items from the first instance of an object created by the same class. Both instances are created without any parameters, so I expect both to be initialized with a empty set in self.__output_providers within the class.

[19:27:48] <Syzygy> it's possible that they are nested deeper within other tags as well.
[19:29:55] <pragmaticenigma> Syzygy: Same would apply, bubble up till you find the desired tag. I haven't worked directly with lxml, so I don't know if it will provide you with a stack of ancestors. But if your target is the <p>, it feels like to me to seek those out, and then determine if the parent or an ancestor is a <section> instead of trying to drill down
[19:32:01] <pragmaticenigma> I had a similar approach when I discovered that HTML form controls can live outside of a <form /> node, but reference it with an attribute. So I opted to seek out form control tags instead, and check who their parent/ancestor was to associate it to the correct collection when I have multiple forms on an HTML document.

[22:09:39] <jinsun> wakeup: yes, use list[int] for 3.9+, List is deprecated
[22:09:45] <wakeup> why?
[22:09:46] *** Joins: ShinyCyril (~ShinyCyri@65.79.144.153)
[22:09:50] <wakeup> why deprecated
[22:09:58] <jinsun> because you can do list[int] now
[22:10:00] <phy1729> because there's a builtin replacement
[22:10:02] *** Quits: rickybob2 (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:10:12] <jinsun> before 3.9 it was not possible so List was needed
[22:10:12] <wakeup> but why is it deprecated
[22:10:16] <wakeup> what's the problem with it
[22:10:28] <jinsun> now it is unnecessary
[22:10:33] *** Quits: bluedust (~bluedust@103.165.167.61) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:10:43] <wakeup> unnecessary doesn't mean deprecated, i guess
[22:10:49] <phy1729> Unless you need to support prior to 3.9, there's no reason to use it
[22:10:52] <wakeup> it's like f strings and format
[22:10:53] <jinsun> yeah but it is deprecated also
[22:10:56] <wakeup> format is not deprecated
[22:11:06] <wakeup> really?
[22:11:11] <wakeup> it's stated in the docs?

[22:12:21] <bjs> wakeup: f-strings can't totally replace .format
[22:12:28] <bjs> but list[...] does entirely replace List[...]
[22:12:29] <jinsun> also format didn't become unnecessaty with f string yeah
[22:12:47] <phy1729> Guest15: I think you should while keybind_is_held(): do_something()
[22:12:58] <wakeup> but why wasn't list initially modified to support list[int] instead of introducing the type hint List?

[22:13:29] *** Joins: kickingvegas (~cchoi@c-73-170-198-141.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[22:13:39] <bjs> wakeup: well for historical reasons. Originally all the typing stuff was an additional thing you could import, so it didn't have any builtin support
[22:13:46] <bjs> and eventually the language has evolved to include more if it directly
[22:13:47] <jinsun> it required implementing a new thing in the language, __class_getitem__
[22:14:10] <bjs> wakeup: because you can't write a .py file to make list[int] work,  they had to actually change the language to do it
[22:14:12] *** coc0nut_ is now known as coc0nut
[22:14:12] <wakeup> but e.g. the built-in "int" was and still is allowed to be used as type hint
[22:14:16] <bjs> Yes
[22:14:19] <bjs> int already existed
[22:14:39] <jinsun> list also worked before, list[int] didn't work

[22:26:35] <ircuz> ahh much much much much better
[22:26:41] <wakeup> btw, for people that have already used virtualenv and docker, which one do you use and for when, in the case of python projects? I know you can combine the two, but docker seems unnecessary unless you have some system dependency, i.e. not a python library that needs to be compiled under hood or something like that or needs some dynamica library
[22:27:13] <wakeup> but docker now seems to be the thing

[22:29:39] <wakeup> I'm just wondering what people more experienced than me think of when one should be used than the other
[22:29:57] <sveinse> wakeup: I use virtualenv for everything related to python projects, but use docker when it needs to run a service, especially when distribution is focus.
[22:30:01] <wakeup> for example, you could create a docker container and don't use virtualenv and install the python packages in the global space of the docker container

[23:12:03] <pragmaticenigma> haslo: I would not recommend changing the default version of python. Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Debian all use python for many of the system adminstrative tasks like package management (apt) and other functions. Upgrading could break the system

[23:38:23] <theseb> SnoopJ: how does batching work in a neural net model with batch propagation? i'm looking at algorithm and it seems to run thru each sample one at a time
[23:38:24] <not_not> but if i ever tried to actually make a tree in python im sure id succeed
[23:38:51] <KirkMcDo1ald> not_not: The trick in Python is, it's all pointers.
[23:38:55] <not_not> pragmaticenigma: ur teaching a neural net to code in python?
[23:38:59] <theseb> not_not: nested lists? what's the problem?
[23:39:31] <not_not> KirkMcDo1ald: yeah i think i know how python works, u have a pyobject and when you declare a variable a pyobject gets created, and if you say a = 10
[23:39:43] <SnoopJ> theseb, generally your inputs go from tensors of shape (N, M, ...) to tensors of shape (batch_size, N, M, ...) where the first (generally) axis represents the dimension of a single batch
[23:39:45] <not_not> u have a pyobject of type number 10 with 1 refcount
[23:40:04] <not_not> if you say b = a, then b and a are pointers to that 10 object but now it has 2 refcount
[23:40:09] <pragmaticenigma> not_not: no... I wrote a manager for a set of providers. I needed to create a second instance of the manager and found it had inherited all the previous instances' providers
[23:40:28] <SnoopJ> theseb, i.e. if you have 32x32 color images and you do batches of size 5, your inputs would go from (32, 32, 3) to (5, 32, 32, 3). The details can vary a little bit, though.
[23:40:31] <not_not> if both a and b go out of scope refcount hits 0 and the object is destroyed

[23:40:41] <KirkMcDo1ald> not_not: Well, integers in particular are interesting in that they are immutable, and small integer objects are aggressively reused.
[23:40:54] <not_not> yeah but lets say a string instead or an instance of a class
[23:41:10] <not_not> so yeah i heard about that most numbers that are commonly used dont get destroyd
[23:41:11] <KirkMcDo1ald> So if you do `a = 10`, it might be the same 10 object that's used everywhere the number 10 comes up.
[23:41:28] <not_not> but a large number like 192013914342358 would be destroyed on 0 refcount
[23:41:32] <KirkMcDo1ald> Sure.

[23:42:43] <KirkMcDo1ald> There is also the factor of integer literals being compiled into the code object as a constant, so that particular value gets created the once.
[23:42:55] <not_not> ye ye
[23:43:00] <SnoopJ> theseb, usually you do batching because you have the hardware to push (forwards or backwards) more than one sample at a time, so you typically set your batch-size to roughly saturate the available compute resources, and you're updating your weights based on entire batches instead of individual samples.
[23:43:03] <KirkMcDo1ald> It's a complicated subject, is my point, heh.
[23:43:10] <not_not> python compiler optimizes alot, still havent used the dis package yet

[23:57:30] <SnoopJ> The limiting case of a larger batch size is one that fits the entire training set in it, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing, but it can affect the accuracy, especially if your train/val sets have subtle differences in them.

[23:58:27] <SnoopJ> In practice, you don't have an infinite amount of compute and datasets are typically larger than what is available, so there's always some ceiling, and you experiment underneath that ceiling to find what works well.
