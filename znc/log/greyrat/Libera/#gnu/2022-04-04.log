[05:41:29] <grae> Hello, does anyone have any good resources for a noob that want to build a very simple FOSS webserver to host a blog that meets the 250kb.club criteria?
[05:42:51] <tvtoon> weird club, 250kb... Anyway, you are looking for lighttpd
[05:43:59] <tvtoon> I don't know what exactly you mean with this bandwidth, but see also minihttpd, microhttpd, shellhttpd... :()
[05:46:30] <grae> wow, thank you! are there any good guides on setting something like this up or should I just RTFM. I just don't want to accidentally build an insecure web server.
[05:49:23] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[05:55:17] <tvtoon> well, I think microhttpd, or it was minihttpd, got a good site filled with information
[05:56:04] <tvtoon> but it is mostly a nobrainer with these simple servers, they aren't packed with the most dangerous stuff
[05:57:09] <jxself> As I understand it, this is a reference to the website and not the server used to send the pages.
[05:57:35] *** Quits: Megver83 (~Icedove@181.212.2.67) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:57:43] <jxself> So any small amount of HTML/CSS should qualify. Just keep it under the size limit.
[05:59:11] <jxself> As an example, that cosmo.red website in the list is being served from GitHub. And that's surely not some tiny webserver. :)
[06:01:00] <jxself> In the meantime, use whatever webserver software you want as long as it's free. Apache, nginx, or whatever.
[06:01:20] <tvtoon> Apache, nonononono :()
[06:01:37] *** Joins: Megver83 (~Icedove@181.212.2.67)
[06:02:21] <jxself> Apache yesyesyesyesyes. I've been using that since 1999.
[06:03:46] <tvtoon> you are wasting time for 23 years, congratulations :()
[06:15:33] <tpefreedom> The only time I've briefly considered using apache was for a site I was thinking of making that would, among other things, talk about some of the more toxic parts of the broader "linux"/BSD/free-software/oss community/slice of the internet.
[06:16:06] <tpefreedom> Particularly some stuff surrounding suckless and the cat-v site, which is linked to 9front.
[06:16:48] <tpefreedom> I don't have any problems with plan9 or software minimalism. I do have a problem with toxicity in the broader community.
[06:17:33] <tpefreedom> Personally, I'd probably use a static site generator instead of handwritten html files.

[06:21:37] <tvtoon> the full security blow is not worthy the trouble for configuring apache, just use something else until you need a dirty sollution, or can build a proper one
[06:25:07] <grae> okay, that's all good to know. I'll definitely check out lighttpd along with those other ones. I also wanted a minimal server along with my web pages. This will be a learning exercise for me more than anything. So lighttdp seems like a good jumping point for me

[17:36:07] <alextee[m]> you mean the whole copyright notice with the standard text? or just the "Copyright (C) xyz" ?
[17:36:35] <bill-auger> IMHO the SPDX header are not informative - they assume too much of the reader's experience with licenses

[17:39:47] <MysteriousSilver> hello anton
[17:40:04] <alextee[m]> I mentioned that my project is REUSE 3.0 compliant so someone wishing to find out more info about file licenses should look in that spec, plus SPDX might become an ISO standard anyway
[17:40:19] <bill-auger> that presumes that all files in the code-base will always be together - no one will ever remove one file, and put it in another program
[17:41:58] <bill-auger> so still, it adds important information to permissive programs, but discards information for GPL programs

[17:43:43] <alextee[m]> so if you copy a file you probably have to do something similar
[17:44:26] <bill-auger> put another way, authors who prefer permissive programs should be stringly encourged to use the REUSE, but it has no value to authors of GPL programs - even with it, they should want to keep the original complete license headers in each file
[17:44:35] <alextee[m]> it's less clear in that case but hopefully it becomes standardized, it's a pretty neat way to have machine generatable/readable "bill of materials" for software

[17:47:25] <alextee[m]> for me the main benefit is that it helps me license all files
[17:47:35] <alextee[m]> the `reuse lint` thing
[17:48:10] <alextee[m]> i had a lot of files missing licenses and it helped me fix that, and it also allows me to properly license binary files in a centralized place when using REUSE
[17:48:20] <bill-auger> there are other tools to automate adding license headers
[17:48:25] <alextee[m]> other than dumping a bunch of COPYING/README files everywhere
[17:49:01] <bill-auger> i think the point there is that you should know which files are in your program - if you did, you would not need to be reminded
[17:50:54] <bill-auger> im not convinced - i see no benefit for GPL authors, other then a presumed convenience, which does not exist in practice
[17:51:32] <bill-auger> you still must remember to add the SPDX header to each file, right? - so there is no added convenience
[17:51:56] <bill-auger> if not, then it is a huge step down from standard GPL practice
[17:52:58] <alextee[m]> it's more of an organization thing than convenience
[17:53:12] <alextee[m]> it's nice to have a standardized way to specify licenses for everything
[17:53:24] <jxself> There could be a benefit to machine-readable copyright & licensing info, but don't forget that this information is really intended for humans though.
[17:53:32] <jxself> Not machines. :)

[17:53:37] <bill-auger> even for GPL programs, i do recommend keeping a file , listing all files and licenses

[17:54:18] <alextee[m]> jxself: that is probably the best way to do it
[17:54:19] <bill-auger> but that has nothing to do with SPDX or REUSE - its just good organization, and helpful information -
[17:56:44] <bill-auger> surely they can co-exist? - does the REUSE spec suggest NOT putting the conventional GPL headers in each file?
[17:58:06] <alextee[m]> bill-auger: they can coexist, REUSE is just about making sure you have license info in every file (with SPDX)
[17:58:08] <jxself> https://reuse.software/tutorial/
[17:58:18] <jxself> It doesn't really say to still add the human stuff though.
[17:58:43] <jxself> The existence of the human piece isn't mention in the spec, and not checked for by the program.

[17:59:49] <alextee[m]> "Nothing prevents you from adding long legal blurbs to your headers or putting a COPYING file in the root of your directory anyway though."
[18:00:17] <bill-auger> probably a pointless question - people who jump on that band-wagon, are going to abandon the GPL conventions, no matter how little value there is in it
[18:00:33] <jxself> Right but that show their point of view though. That it's an old backward-compatible option. Not their recommended way.
[18:00:40] <alextee[m]> considering that most people don't license things properly, it will help in the majority of cases IMO
[18:00:55] <bill-auger> "nothing prevents you" ... "except for your own laziness" - so be it - RIP GPL headers
[18:01:19] <bill-auger> it will help permissively licensed projects immensely
[18:01:33] <alextee[m]> there are too many repos that dump the standard GPL 3.0 license in a COPYING file and don't bother with any header info at all
[18:01:46] <alextee[m]> you don't even know if it's "or later"
[18:01:56] <jxself> If people don't currently care to do things properly anyway (whether GPL or not), how will the existence of Refuse make them care?
[18:02:18] <jxself> Thinking on "people don't license things properly, it will help in the majority of cases"
[18:02:29] <alextee[m]> well at least you have a tool that yells at you for failing to be compliant
[18:02:34] <jxself> If they didn't care previously...
[18:02:48] <jxself> That assume they're using it and if they didn't care previously...
[18:03:00] <jxself> SO what makes them use the tool?
[18:03:26] <bill-auger> i beleive that the hope is for the authors of editors and IDEs to add a feature to automatically nag the user
[18:03:48] <jxself> That might be nice. Depending on if it happens and how it's done.
[18:04:04] <bill-auger> if that does not happen, then jxself's point is exactly right
[18:04:08] <alextee[m]> the fact that it helps them adhere to a standardized licensing scheme. otherwise they have to research how to do licensing themselves and most people just wont. but if there's a tool like REUSE becoming widespread I think most people will use it
[18:04:34] <alextee[m]> having a standard helps things like IDEs too yeah
[18:05:17] <qrpnxz> REUSE is pretty good. pmuch is just debian copyright tracking
[18:05:26] <qrpnxz> (which is the best)
[18:05:52] <jxself> But we have a standard on https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html
[18:05:57] <jxself> And if people don't currently do it, launching another project will make them do it? I don't think so. I imagine that the people doing it are those that already care about these issues.
[18:06:28] <alextee[m]> jxself: that standard requires reading comprehension vs having a tool failing if you don't do things right
[18:06:28] <qrpnxz> that's okay for a single author no doubt :)
[18:07:13] <alextee[m]> people already following the GNU howto's don't really benefit much from REUSE other than having a standard way to organize licenses
[18:07:52] <alextee[m]> but I think it will benefit most people that don't follow best practices for licensing
[18:07:56] <jxself> But you're still missing, I think, the thing. That there needs to be something to make them care about using the tool. Merely creating it and putting up a website doesn't.
[18:08:00] <alextee[m]> just because they don't have time or don't bother other than when github tells them to add a license to their repo 
[18:08:19] <qrpnxz> the benefit is: 1) one place to see all copyright information (easy for users and machines, fast for everyone) 2) cleans up files
[18:08:21] <bill-auger> most authors using the GPL do not nees a "way to organizes licenses" - they only use one licenses
[18:08:49] <alextee[m]> things like github could push it jxself considering linux foundation is behind SPDX I can see it getting tracktion
[18:09:16] <bill-auger> i noticed this week that github removed the bit that once told you the license
[18:09:42] <qrpnxz> mmm, no they haven't
[18:09:57] <bill-auger> it still detects the LICENSE file but does not identify it
[18:10:10] <bill-auger> oh maybe i saw a poor exanmple
[18:10:16] <qrpnxz> if the format is not standard it won't know what to say
[18:10:24] <alextee[m]> it sometimes doesn't identify licenses bill-auger 
[18:10:35] <alextee[m]> it never identified AGPL for me in one repository but it did in another
[18:13:24] <qrpnxz> if anything it's a feature not being detected by Github, they are just going to display something stupid like "GPL 3" when i clearly say or any later version
