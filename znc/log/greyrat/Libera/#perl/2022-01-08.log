[01:43:09] <LeoNerd> skrzyp: Quite a few folks use the libtickit C library; but not many people other than me seem to write applications in Perl
[01:43:24] <zgu> wow
[01:43:24] <skrzyp> LeoNerd: oh okay
[01:43:25] <LeoNerd> Tickit (the perl module) is just a library binding to the C library
[01:43:50] <skrzyp> the question is - can I consider it stable?
[01:44:07] <LeoNerd> What do you mean "stable"?
[01:44:24] <LeoNerd> It's been driving such things as this very IRC client I'm using to talk now, for most of the past decade
[01:44:30] <skrzyp> I mean, no huge breaking changes within a single release
[01:44:38] <LeoNerd> Indeed not. I'm very careful about that
[01:44:53] <skrzyp> I'm planning to write something between a logger and a "shell" for ham radio operators
[01:45:38] <skrzyp> mostly for my own use, but I would like to distribute it after that, and that's why also asked about Perl on Windows XP before, since many ham radio guys are old mans still using such machines
[01:45:47] <zgu> hah
[01:46:05] <skrzyp> and the radio interfacing isn't an issue at all - simple binary protocols over serial wire
[01:46:06] <zgu> actually, might want to look into win 98 compatibility while you're at it
[01:46:14] <skrzyp> ehh
[01:46:20] <skrzyp> not that far
[01:46:36] <zgu> i guess pre-NT isn't really worth it

[01:47:32] <skrzyp> slowly
[01:47:34] <skrzyp> but steady
[01:48:18] <skrzyp> after all, packaging such thingt in single static executable is also important for "public relations" and overall UX to that audience :)
[01:48:41] <zgu> ham stuff should really be all linux-based. it's a very inherently 'open source' community
[01:49:21] <skrzyp> of course it is
[01:49:37] <skrzyp> the actual ham radio manifesto describes that dierctly
[01:49:53] <skrzyp> but old people compare FOSS to communism are mostly against open software 
[01:49:59] <skrzyp> that's quite a tough topic 
[01:50:29] <zgu> which makes no sense
[01:50:37] <skrzyp> of course it doesn't
[01:50:53] <zgu> there's no reason for an independent programmer who's not selling their software to also not release source code
[01:51:48] <Adura> Well, what if your code runs great but looks like shit?
[01:51:52] <zgu> it just ensures that whenever you get bored of maintaining it (since, you know, it's not your day job or anything) it will start to fade away because no one else can either
[01:52:07] <skrzyp> but I've seen things like CW trainer in Delphi 7 with self modifying code, machine-based DRM, time bomb, executable obfuscation and no documentation, was told "ask me if you need help and let me know if it that copy won't work on your machine, I'll generate you a new one but it will work onyl for you for limited time"

[01:55:08] <skrzyp> Grinnz: someone already mentioned it before and I've seen it, looks nice 
[01:55:18] <Grinnz> it has some rough edges, but it works
[01:56:04] <skrzyp> but I wonder if I can just embed the perl bytecode with perlcc instead of sources+interpreter to decrease binary size and memory usage
[01:57:50] <Grinnz> that's not particularly supported, but you're welcome to try
[01:58:40] <zgu> just don't be one of those people who just ships the PAR exe without a link to the corresponding source for anyone who wants to run it on another platform
[01:58:59] <skrzyp> oh no no no
[01:59:09] <skrzyp> it will be thoroughly documented and linked
[01:59:38] <skrzyp> but most people are only interested in living working executable which they don't need to setup with whole Perl environment or even install
[01:59:55] <zgu> yeah
[02:00:21] <skrzyp> and the only artifact on target machine would be some sqlite database with config and the actual logger data 
[02:00:37] <skrzyp> with import and export to ADIF, I've seen very nice module for that on CPAN already

[04:08:32] <Grinnz> erm, weird thing to want, but that is the only way yes
[04:09:06] <Kobaz> i have a lot of automatic logging, and if carp already put out a stack trace then i don't have to generate one in my warn handler
[04:09:17] *** Quits: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:09:48] <Grinnz> well, the most common Carp functions only print one stack frame
[04:09:56] <Kobaz> cluck
[04:10:23] <Grinnz> anyway if Carp is in the stack for your warn handler it's usually gonna be the direct caller?
[04:10:33] <Kobaz> not necessarily
[04:10:48] <Kobaz> well, this is a sub of a sub of a warn handler
[04:11:19] <Kobaz> i could set a flag in the main warn handler, but i don't actually have a main-main warn handler

[04:32:54] <Kobaz> i can just check the stack for the package Carp
[04:33:13] <aquanight> if you're talking about $SIG{__WARN__} then yes that too
[04:33:29] <Kobaz> yeah
[04:33:32] <Kobaz> yup
[04:33:45] <aquanight> however
[04:33:46] <aquanight> consider
[04:34:00] <aquanight> swevalnl: use Carp; sub test { warn Carp::longmess("moo") } test;
[04:34:02] <perlbot> aquanight: moo at (IRC) line 1.␤	require /eval/perl_code_7d1goBoknX called at -e line 96␤1
[04:34:43] <aquanight> Carp::short/longmess can be used to generate stack traces without calling carp/cluck/croak/confess directly
[04:34:53] <aquanight> you might want to detect these as well

[04:35:08] <Kobaz> wouldn't the package name be there though?
[04:35:26] <aquanight> you won't see Carp in the callstack if they use warn Carp::longmess
[04:35:31] <Kobaz> ah
[04:35:38] <aquanight> you'll have to examine $@ or whatever it's in
[04:36:01] <aquanight> hence the regex
[04:36:13] <aquanight> Carp adds indented lines to the initial message hence /\n\s+/
[04:36:21] <Kobaz> yeah
[04:36:38] <aquanight> this can still be fooled
[04:36:56] <aquanight> but I think at that point someone is desperately trying and maybe you should worry about why than worrying about trying to stop them
[04:37:05] <Kobaz> hahaha

[04:39:31] <aquanight> well
[04:39:35] <aquanight> I suppose I should say
[04:39:45] <aquanight> either desperately trying or a really weird coincidence
[04:39:55] <aquanight> but the response to the 2nd is still the same
[04:40:07] <aquanight> find out why and fix it at the source
[04:40:41] <aquanight> idiot proofing your code just results in upgraded idiots
[04:41:28] <Kobaz> heh
[04:43:33] *** Joins: frost (~frost@user/frost)
[04:46:18] <manjaroi3> can I define signal label for ualarm? I'm writing some repeat subs with ualarm + SIG{ALRM}. but I think I can't declare multiple subs in this way
[04:47:14] <Kobaz> what's the goal?
[04:48:18] <manjaroi3> running multiple repeat subs, each has interval time
[04:48:21] <aquanight> correct you can only have one SIGALRM handler
[04:48:43] <aquanight> there are a couple ways to solve this
[04:48:54] <Kobaz> i was stuck on what 'repeat subs' means
[04:49:04] <aquanight> use a single handler that operates at the GCD interval of each repeated task
[04:49:11] <manjaroi3> like setInterval() in javascript
[04:49:27] <aquanight> and track elapsed time to call your required tasks at their appointed times
[04:49:29] <Kobaz> when i have multiple things to do, i'll just make callbacks
[04:49:46] <aquanight> well really that's pretty much the way to solve it
[04:50:04] <aquanight> and it just so happens that one or another event loop module will take care of that for you
[04:50:13] <Kobaz> event loops, yay
[04:50:30] <aquanight> for example
[04:50:35] <aquanight> https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Async::Timer::Periodic
[04:50:36] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ IO::Async::Timer::Periodic - event callback at regular intervals - metacpan.org ]
[04:50:55] <buu> Down with event loops
[04:50:58] <buu> Up with threads
[04:51:13] <aquanight> buu: por que no los dos
[04:51:23] <aquanight> event loop managing a thread pool
[04:51:36] <Kobaz> aren't perl threads still 'Do-Not-Use'
[04:51:53] <aquanight> if they are that is very sad
[04:52:01] <buu> Naw, I mean, they're fine, they're just not amazing
[04:52:09] <aquanight> perlbot: threads
[04:52:09] <perlbot> aquanight: The use of interpreter-based threads in perl is officially discouraged (see http://p3rl.org/threads ) - please let us help you find a better way (see also http://goo.gl/yMZeag for more details, and https://goo.gl/o8PwA7 for some alternative options)
[04:52:11] <Kobaz> i've writen some threaded perl that's not too bad
[04:52:22] <buu> Basically perl threads are very very similar to fork so you don't get a ton of benefit from them
[04:53:11] <buu> It would have been a major selling point for Perl To The Future but no one really cares
[04:53:40] <Kobaz> light weight threads in perl would be the wins
[04:53:59] <buu> Yup
[04:54:21] <buu> It is insanely hard to retrofit them into a switch based vm like perl though
[04:54:25] <buu> see also python and ruby
[04:54:34] <buu> Even js hasn't managed it
[04:55:28] <manjaroi3> buu, What's the mean Up, Down?
[04:55:46] <buu> manjaroi3: up means approval, down means disapproval
[04:55:54] *** Quits: capn (~capn@user/capn) (Quit: Later!)
[04:55:55] <buu> like thumbs up / thumbs down
[04:56:10] <manjaroi3> :>
[04:56:22] <buu> It's an interesting question as to where the etymology of that comes from
[04:56:44] <buu> I feel like a phrase like "down with the tyrant!" goes back a long way and possible to different languages
[04:56:47] <buu> But I have no idea!
[04:56:56] <Adura> Roman gladiatorial combat?
[04:57:38] <aquanight> the problem with lacking proper threads is with win32. Win32 UI model expects you to be able to thread if you want to do anything more complicated than a toaster.
[04:58:08] <aquanight> you don't ever want to block the window thread
[04:58:32] <Kobaz> yeah
[04:58:34] <Kobaz> tis bad
[04:58:52] <aquanight> it's the cardinal rule of good useable applications
[04:58:54] <Adura> You'd think MCE would be mentioned in Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::Threads, but maybe I'm not understanding MCE's intended use.
[04:58:56] <aquanight> thou shalt not block UI
[04:59:08] <Kobaz> tell that to quickbooks
[04:59:10] <buu> Adura: romans never used a thumbs down gesture though
[04:59:31] <buu> They might have had a "down to (hades/hell/etc)!" expression though
[04:59:34] <aquanight> quickboots can go right to hell
[05:00:07] <buu> What is MCE
[05:00:09] <Adura> buu, maybe it looked like down to losers being hung upside down.
[05:00:25] <Adura> https://metacpan.org/dist/MCE
[05:00:25] <Kobaz> https://i.imgur.com/pH3tQIP.jpg
[05:00:25] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ MCE-1.876 - Many-Core Engine for Perl providing parallel processing capabilities - metacpan.org ]
[05:00:28] <buu> Adura: They probably didn't get much of a chance to pass that thought on
[05:00:30] <aquanight> buu: machine check exceptions? I think if you're dealing with those you need to fix your cooling loop.
[05:00:37] <Adura> Heh
[05:00:44] <buu> Well that's terrifying
[05:01:25] <buu> Could be cool though

[20:20:17] <jaggz> how could you guys not complain for years about indented heredoc highlighting not working properly in vim

[20:20:50] <aquanight> I still can't get it to understand signatures
[20:21:01] <jaggz> anyway.. I posted a pull request and contacted the perl vim syntax maintainers
[20:21:15] <LeoNerd> Ohgod it's -terrible-
[20:21:34] <LeoNerd> Plus I've given up trying to work out how to talk to any of them and add any of the past decade's additions, let alone any of my new syntax modules
[20:21:53] <LeoNerd> try/catch/finally, async/await, class/method/field, match/case, dynamically, ... probably a few more I've missed

[20:46:08] <pragma-> goodness
[20:46:10] <aquanight> it's not a question of parsing

[20:47:24] <aquanight> thus this approach: wrapping each part in a do block to force nextstate ops

[20:48:39] <pragma-> That makes sense.
[20:50:54] <pragma-> Hmm. Is there an option to do a static analyis pass over the code for any obvious uninitialized or potentially-uninitialized variables?
[20:50:59] <aquanight> if I'm not mistaken I believe nextstate ops are also important because they provide the targets of labeled goto/next/last/redo
[20:51:14] <aquanight> pragma-: not easily.
[20:51:27] <aquanight> it again falls into the static analysis trap
[20:51:33] <aquanight> only perl can parse perl
[20:51:42] <xenu> it doesn't have to be perfect
[20:51:50] <xenu> it could be done with PPI
[20:52:11] <aquanight> hmmm

[20:52:19] <aquanight> I wonder if something could be done to use the O.pm mechanism
[20:52:34] <aquanight> rather than having to parse syntax you can read an optree
[20:52:46] <aquanight> and that's *much* more viable
