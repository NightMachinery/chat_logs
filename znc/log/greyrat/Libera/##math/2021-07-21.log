[00:15:55] <cherim__> Arnold's extended argument goes "people worked with groups of transformations, which arise naturally, since long ago. Then they decided to make the concept abstract and introduced group axioms.
[00:16:45] <cherim__> But then it was shown (Cauchy theorem and the like) that this definition does not lead to new objects at all, since every abstract group is a group of transformations.
[00:17:40] <cherim__> People worked with (hyper)surfaces in R^n which are natural since long ago, then they decided to introduce manifolds in a completely abstract and axiomatic way.
[00:18:24] <cherim__> But it may be shown that this does not lead to any new objects again because of Whitney's embedding theorem.

[01:21:11] <tusko> Would that be roughly equivalent to differentiation?
[01:22:14] <mefistofeles> no, why?
[01:22:54] <int-e> applied to a finite power series? you're encoding (x^n)' = n x^n there, so nope. You need to account for the reduction in the exponent.
[01:24:21] <tusko> int-e, that is to say it would have (n-1) continuous derivatives?
[01:25:28] <int-e> maybe I'm reading too much into this. you could use e^(nx) as a basis for functions and then that *would* be the corresponding differentiation operator
[01:25:55] <int-e> so "no" is the better answer until you explain *how* that is like differentiation.

[06:51:27] <tusko> what are the field axioms?
[06:52:00] <Boarders> though actually I think it is true over any field?
[06:52:47] <Boarders> well I guess the only fields can be C or R
[06:53:14] <Boarders> but if you have <v,v> > 0 and you have that <k x, y> = k <x, y> then ...
[06:53:32] <Boarders> well I guess you need some symmetry too
[06:53:38] <Boarders> actually I am probably wrong
[06:54:17] <anovick__> tusko: yes C is a field
[06:54:24] <bosspotato> yeah not clear if it's true over any field but it's definitely super true over C or R

[06:57:13] <Boarders> tusko: yes I was not confused about that
[06:57:16] <bosspotato> just pick your favorite nonzero v, take k = (v,v) and set v' = v / sqrt(k) which will have the desired property
[06:57:23] <Boarders> I was confused about what field inner product space is defined over
[06:58:27] <anovick__> bosspotato: so this isn't true in V = {0} then

[07:01:29] <bosspotato> the only counterexample
[07:02:43] <Oberon4278> So I'm trying to figure out how to divide a 90 degree angle into three equal angles and you'd think it's just 30 degrees each, but when I draw it it's obvious that one of the angles is NOT 30 degrees. At least, if I'm not an absolute idiot it's obvious.

[07:04:46] <anovick__> bosspotato: very nice proof for the non- V = {0} scenario. thank you!! helped me a lot
[07:05:24] <Oberon4278> So the inside angle is 90 in total. The outside is 270. If you take two 30 degree angles off of the perpendicular lines, each going toward the inside, you end up with a 210 degree difference between them on the outside and 150 inside. Right?

[07:13:05] <Oberon4278> Ok nobody has objected, so next step: I've expressed this relationship as b = 270-2a where a is obviously the angle of the two pieces coming off the perpendicular, and b is the single angle where they meet

[07:15:12] <Oberon4278> Instead of two linear equations. Like normally I'd solve one for a then substitute that into the other, but if I try that here I get 270-2a = 270-2a and I'm like... yep that's a tautology alright!
[07:15:23] <Oberon4278> Actually maybe I should just try solving it and see what I get.

[07:38:25] <Oberon4278> It's for crown molding / moulding.
[07:39:23] <Oberon4278> Two walls meet at 90 degrees, instead of having the moulding meet at a right angle I want to have little wedges -- two of them -- that break it up a little.
[07:39:54] <Oberon4278> And I need to calculate what angle to cut them at so it all comes out equal.
[07:40:52] <Oberon4278> Also my formula is wrong because a = b at 90 degrees, so... yeah.

[11:08:58] <tusko> All the solutions of ay'' + by' + cy = 0 for a,b,c in R, a,b,c > 0
[11:09:29] <greenbagels> use the characteristic polynomial method and see where it leads you
[11:09:59] <tusko> I think this is what I did. So I said ansatz y(t) = e^rt
[11:11:21] <tusko> So I get ar^2 + br + c = 0
[11:12:11] <tusko> and then this will have either the same, repeated root; two distinct roots; or two complex conjugate roots.
[11:13:18] <tusko> If it is the same, repeated root then the general solution should be something like y(t) = C_1 * e^rt + C_2 * te^rt
[11:14:02] <tusko> If it is two distinct roots, then y(t) = C_1 * e^(r_1t) + C_2 * e^(r_2t)

[11:21:00] <greenbagels> for example; if you have two distinct real roots, what does this tell you about a,b,c?
[11:21:23] <greenbagels> two distinct real roots, both > 0 *

[15:51:52] <OverCoder> I mean I could go ahead and plot it and I'd figure it's symmetrical
[15:52:17] <OverCoder> But I'm sure there's a more methodological algebraic way to go about this
[15:52:34] <OverCoder> So far I understand that f(-x) should turn out to be same as -f(x)
[15:53:00] <OverCoder> but the fact that the function is different depending on different ranges is confusing me
[15:53:11] *** Quits: Julian (~tos9@python/site-packages/Julian) (Quit: leaving)
[15:53:36] <OverCoder> for example when solving f(-x) should I be substituting in the first line or the second one?
[15:54:11] <OverCoder> and what -f(x) I am going to compare it to
[15:57:34] <cherim__> Technically, f(-x)=-f(x) does not hold for x=0
[15:57:57] <OverCoder> it does?
[15:58:01] <Franciman> it does
[15:58:04] <Franciman> it just means that f(0) = 0
[15:58:06] <Franciman> if it holds
[15:58:17] <Franciman> that's a cool property of odd functions
[15:58:37] <OverCoder> hmmm yes
[15:58:44] <cherim__> have you seen https://irc.overcoder.dev/uploads/76d5a704dfd56448/IMG_20210721_142045.jpg from the question asked?
[15:59:29] <OverCoder> so far I've figured out that for f(-x) I'd put the -x inside the function of the negative range
[15:59:42] <OverCoder> and the output should be -f(x) where f(x) is the positive range definition
[15:59:58] <OverCoder> I'll assume this holds true for any odd function defined like that, hmm
[16:00:24] <OverCoder> cherim__, f(0) in the first line is pi/2 - 0 which is just pi/2
[16:00:35] <OverCoder> f(0) in the second line is -pi/2 - 0 which is just pi/2
[16:00:41] <OverCoder> which is just -pi/2 *
[16:00:48] <OverCoder> so it kinda works
[16:00:52] <cherim__> First line has nothing to do with x=0

[16:27:49] <quarterback> the problem says ,the room contains air. That means fresh air and polluted or stale air which contains many gases perhaps.

[16:28:03] <pikapika> What is the time period after which something is "stale"?
[16:28:11] <quarterback> Yes, I am only interested in fresh air.
[16:28:11] <pikapika> Is it a fixed time or is it a decay function
[16:28:20] <pikapika> Air is air

[16:31:31] <pikapika> quarterback, no that isn't correct
[16:31:46] <pikapika> cherim__, the problem is that
[16:32:00] <quarterback> cherim__, Fresh air and stale air occupy the same volume but they dont mix with each other.
[16:32:03] <pikapika> These are not two different fluids. Clearly what was once fresh air has to at some point turn into stale air.
[16:32:30] <cherim__> Certainly, the problem just makes no sense when treated seriously
[16:32:30] <pikapika> Perhaps it might do to try model it as a chemical equation, the chemists have some methods of modelling reactions as odes
[16:32:37] <quarterback> Even if fresh and stale air mix, it will take lot of time .
[16:32:48] <cherim__> But there is only one equation the author could intend
[16:33:15] <pikapika> treat fresh and stale as two different compounds and assume some reaction rates for conversion of fresh to stale
[16:33:18] <quarterback> Yes, only one equation to define volume of fresh air.
[16:34:56] <pikapika> something like F -> S, but also adding a term for the injection of new fresh air, and the ejection of the whole mixture

[16:35:19] <quarterback> That seems reasonable

[16:35:58] <pikapika> and say assume a linear conversion rate of the reaction with say a factor of c
[16:36:23] <pikapika> On rereading the question
[16:36:33] <pikapika> I think its best to just define fresh and stale air as two different fluids
[16:36:36] <pikapika> that don't interconvert
[16:36:42] <pikapika> I think I understand the given problem now
[16:37:01] <pikapika> the initial condition of the room must be assumed to be wholly stale
[16:37:10] <pikapika> as also stated

[16:37:24] <quarterback> pikapika, Think of air mixture as  a litre of purified water mixed into a gallon of mud water.

[16:38:46] <quarterback> pikapika, I think its only possible to think of air as two ways - fresh and not fresh. That may mean probabilistic approach.
[16:39:10] <pikapika> There is no probability involved
[16:39:20] <pikapika> As cherim__ already stated previously
[16:39:40] <pikapika> I think its intended to treat fresh and stale air as non-reacting fluids for the duration of the experiment
[16:39:45] <quarterback> Yes the one equation only measures fresh and non fresh air.
[16:39:52] <quarterback> So only one variable maybe.
[16:42:00] <quarterback> Lets say amount of fresh air is y. Then non fresh air is 2000-y
[16:42:09] <quarterback> Lets say amount of fresh air is y. Then non fresh air is 20000-y *
[16:43:08] <quarterback> I liked the way to measure fresh air by mass than volume. If its done by volume, it will occupy 20000 ft³ actually.

[18:38:26] <ppw> I assumed the issue came from the left vs. right stochastic matrix convention
[18:39:09] <ppw> ie are the stochastic vectors arranged in columns or in rows
[18:39:50] <ppw> but then I thought if I just transpose the matrix, I can find its eigenvectors and thereby solve the problem
[18:40:30] <schillingklaus> sure
[18:41:35] <ppw> but none of the eigenvectors equal the stationary vector.
[18:42:28] <ppw> maybe it's best to give an example: by the right-stochastic convention, M = [[0.99,0.01],[0.8,0.2]].

[22:12:16] <rubiksdream> in a non-commutative ring, doesn't one have to specify left/right ideal? aren't they not necessarily the same
[22:12:24] <Franciman> yup
[22:12:27] <Z-module> Franciman: why what?
[22:12:29] <Franciman> in fact there are bilateral ideals too
[22:12:42] <Franciman> tusko: what subjects would you like to review?
[22:12:45] <Z-module> in non-comm rings, the word "ideal" by itself always means two-sided
[22:12:56] <Z-module> you have to say "left ideal" or "right ideal" if you only mean that

[22:13:15] <tusko> Franciman, I just want to deepen my knowledge generally, I guess. My first course was good but he went hard on us so I feel like I just survived.
[22:13:16] <Z-module> the set you wrote is a (two-sided) ideal, as you can easily check
[22:13:40] *** Joins: wonderlost (~wonderlos@161.167.229.15)
[22:13:57] <Franciman> Z-module: uff, we defined the symmetric algebra as the usual quotient of the tensor algebra V, with respect to the ( v (x) w - w (x) v )
[22:13:58] <rubiksdream> right, i guess just set f_i = 1 to show its a right ideal, and g_i = 1 to show its a left ideal
[22:14:07] <Franciman> now you take the k grade quotient

[22:14:33] <Franciman> and I want to prove that the set of all e_{i_1} (x) ..... (x) e_{i_n} with i_1 <= .... <= i_n
[22:14:41] <Franciman> is indeed a basis. Ok it is obvious it generates the space
[22:14:48] <Franciman> but why the heck is it independent linearly?
[22:15:23] <Franciman> tusko: uhm I see, linear algebra done wrong was cool for me. Otherwise you can read Serge Lang's algebra book, ofc only on the linear algebra topics
[22:15:42] <tusko> Thanks brev
[22:15:45] <Z-module> You can't casually say it's a "basis" unless you already believe it's both independent and spanning.
[22:15:51] <Franciman> it is
[22:15:51] <Z-module> that's what "basis" means
[22:15:54] <Franciman> because my book says so
[22:15:59] <Franciman> but I need to prove the claim
[22:17:17] <Z-module> Mathematicians are a bit like insurance clients.
[22:17:27] <Franciman> intuitively I would say that the elements of the ideal (u(x)v - v(x)u) can not be written in terms of the generators I showed above
[22:17:33] <Z-module> Contantly putting in all sorts of claims, some of them pretty darned outlandish.,

[22:19:38] <Franciman> i gots to leave
[22:19:47] <Z-module> I"m the opposite of that
[22:19:48] <Franciman> looks like I'll have to think about this damn thing later
[22:19:56] <Franciman> Z-module: then you can accept me saying it is a basis without giving a proof
[22:19:58] <Franciman> :D
[22:20:03] <Z-module> I can, sure
[22:20:08] <Franciman> because it is true
[22:20:16] <Franciman> eheh I am just kidding

[22:26:52] <Z-module> In fact, when I had to pass a language exam as part of a math PhD program, and I had chosen French, the professor asked me to downstairs to the library and come back with any Bourbaki volume in French of my choice. I brought back "Algèbre Multilinéaire", from which he had me translate a few pages from the introduction.
[22:27:11] <Z-module> to *go downstairs

[22:46:33] <johnkeats6> (v in V gives you the 'wedge with v' morphism from /\^{k-1} to /\^k)
[22:47:46] <johnkeats6> somehow using this you could re-interpret a morphism f : V --> V and end up relating it to the induced /\^k f : /\^k V --> /\^k V (which is multiplication by det f)
