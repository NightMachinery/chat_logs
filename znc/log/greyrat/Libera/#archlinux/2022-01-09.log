[02:22:43] <MacGyver> Start by comparing the partition tables, whether their block counts are correct; then maybe see what LUKS reports.
[02:23:08] <MacGyver> LUKS tends to just assume it's got the entire partition though so I'd imagine it's the partition table itself that's actually off.

[08:36:51] <locrian9> Have looked at this wiki for setting locale (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/local) but seems like the 'LANG' variable isn't setting to 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' when I have it set inside /etc/locale.conf http://ix.io/jNY.  Is there another file that could be overwritting this LANG variable?  I see 'LANG=en_US' instead of 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' after I restart my archlinux and enter 'locale' in my terminal 
[08:36:57] <locrian9> http://ix.io/3LAu.  Trying to make sure my locale is set correctly, since my 'font glyphs' are showing up as squares when I try to issue echo -e $"\ue09e" in my terminal.

[09:17:03] <tomty89> dirtcastle: and do you sometimes or never get any sound from the VM?
[09:18:21] <tomty89> dirtcastle: I have no simple magic for you btw. The commands I gave is to help you find out whether the emulated sound card is detected at all on the guest side.
[09:19:06] <tomty89> dirtcastle: With that said, make sure you have VirtualBox emulating one for this particular VM
[09:19:21] <dirtcastle> tomty89, before I launch virtualbox , if I was already connected to headphones, the virtualbox connects directly to headphones. but after it launches, if I unplug headphones, the audio comes from laptop speaker. if I connect headphones again the audio won't be detected. so If I want to use headphones, I need to connect it before launch and shouldn't unplug it (even accidentally) at any cost. 
[09:19:46] <tomty89> huh
[09:20:24] <dirtcastle> 🥲

I attempted using `tee`, but it doesn't show me the unbuffered output in this case.

[16:16:16] <rhylx> I wanned to know if you have some clever ways to insert unicodes easily :)

[17:00:00] <zenof> hey, I still need help on this: when I try to connect my hdd with a sata-to-usb adaptor, fdisk reports the device to be 1 sector _bigger_ than is does when I connect it directly via the sata-port on the board. when I open the LUKS container in it (which works in both cases), the dm-device is 4 sectors _smaller_ when I use the sata-to-usb adaptor compared to when I use direct sata. and this results in the filesystem to exceed 
[17:00:00] <zenof> the "physical" device's size to exactly one block. which to me sounds like a problem with the block sizes. how can I check and maybe tune what block sizes are used?

[17:21:52] <fafke> hello guys
[17:21:55] <grawity> anyway, the kernel option "usb-storage.quirks=VID:PID:c" (with VID:PID taken from lsusb) will set the FIX_CAPACITY flag; it's specifically for the situation where /* Some disks return the total number of blocks in response to READ CAPACITY rather than the highest block number. */
[17:21:55] <fafke> i have a question
[17:22:15] <fafke> is it possible to add desklets to manjaro xfce?
[17:22:47] <grawity> as opposed to regular archlinux xfce?

[17:23:46] <grawity> not 100% sure on what "desklets" are, though I can guess
[17:23:57] <fafke> wait i will show you
[17:24:17] <grawity> but it sounds like something that xfce doesn't have *built-in*, but could be easily added by extra software

[17:24:52] <fafke> is there a way to add this one on manjaro?
[17:25:06] <grawity> 1) has nothing to do with manjaro, 2) this isn't the manjaro channel
[17:25:17] <fafke> ow
[17:25:20] <grawity> but those seem to be specific to cinnamon desktop (I'm guessing they're gnome-shell addons)

The issue is it works when the machine starts, then 5 minutes after, I dont know what happens but the machine is no longer reachable from my network I have to reboot it, and it works for 5 minutes, and over and over again. I figure its something to do with the powersave so I added : `power_save=0` to `/
[19:23:51] <faisal> etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf` I still get some disconnections. I have the dmesg output for when it fails here : https://pastebin.com/0mp7yKqy but can't make sense of it. Wonder if someone has an idea by any chance please ?

[23:35:26] <perrierjouet> you 
[23:35:46] <oscen> well not necessarily want to leave, it's just that there's really not a point to it
[23:35:53] <nothereisnotanam> How can you use uefi and `systemd-boot` to boot aarch64 mainline kernel on a pi4? is it just uninstalling `uboot,` unzipping the pi4 uefi firmware zip, enable `systemd-boot` with `bootctl` like x86, and reboot.
[23:36:04] <Namarrgon> nothereisnotanam: #archlinuxarm

[23:37:56] <nothereisnotanam> yes
[23:38:10] <oscen> perriorjouet: you can enable arch repos (not core repo) and still use the aur, the artix repos are mostly a clone with packages that help with each of their init systems (e.g. postgresql-runit, postgresql-openrc)
