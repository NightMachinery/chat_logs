[00:20:45] <FromGitter> <Grimpper> if i remove the parenthesis it says that the dap adapter is not loaded
[00:21:29] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> yes it must be
[00:21:45] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's a list
[00:22:55] <FromGitter> <Grimpper> I see. Is there a way to know if a var is a list or a string?
[00:23:37] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> read source code
[00:23:46] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that's the answer to every question
[00:26:15] <FromGitter> <Grimpper> okay. I will learn lisp then
[00:29:55] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> `C-h v`/`SPC h v` will bring up a variable's documentation if it has any. That should normally tell you the expected type of the variable.
[00:31:45] <FromGitter> <Grimpper> thanks!

[07:04:38] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> After the latest Spacemacs update, the Spacemacs buffer loads successfully, but it seems if there's an agenda item containing an org-mode link, the link is shown as plain text i.e. with all its components visible.

[15:40:28] <FromGitter> <dspearson> Hi folks. I have noticed a bug with golden-ratio and multi-term, and confirmed the behaviour with a fresh install. I add the following to dotspacemacs-configuration-layers: ‚èé  ‚èé ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=62138134d1b64840db3125f6]
[15:42:07] <FromGitter> <dspearson> When enabling golden-ratio with SPC t g, then firing up a shell with SPC ', and switching back to the other window with SPC w TAB, the windows are not resized. This is the smallest reproducible example I could make, but it likely explains why  I was getting random failures with golden-ratio that mostly made it unusable as default-on.
[15:45:00] <FromGitter> <dspearson> The same non-resizing is happening quite often for me. I just tested with my original setup, and a simple SPC w -, and moving between the windows with SPC w TAB does not resize. Could it be a missing binding?
[15:46:15] <FromGitter> <dspearson> SPC w -> (directional arrow key) resizes them fine, so it looks like the issue is solely with SPC w TAB.
