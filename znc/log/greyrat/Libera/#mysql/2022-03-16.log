[17:32:05] <Isotopp> Bushcat: nobody here will recommend to use phpmyadmin for serious work
[17:32:41] <Bushcat> okay thanks Isotopp anything you can pass on for recommendation ?
[17:33:24] <Isotopp> Bushcat: for service here, whatever the issue, reproduce it with the commandline client for easy cut and paste, and for unshortened results. use pastebin to dpaste, and run the "mysql" command line client with --show-warnings.
[17:33:53] <Isotopp> Bushcat: phpmyadmin is written in php, which is subject to a number of limitations wrt to memory and runtime, and thus often fails for serious work
[17:34:12] <Bushcat> okay thanks
[17:34:32] <Isotopp> Bushcat: phpmyadmin is also running as part of a web server, so each time you speak to phpmyadmin, you talk to a different process with a different connection, so anything involving any of the following things fails:

[17:50:23] <cart_> Is there a way to run scripts into a mysql DB without having mysql db currently installed on that machine but only the client?
[17:50:54] <cart_> I get -> ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)    BUT I can not install mysql server on this machine
[17:50:57] <cart_> only the client
[17:53:38] <Naktibalda> well, you must connect to some mysql server
[17:54:11] <Naktibalda> it can be on another computer
[17:55:14] <Isotopp> cart_: if you install the mysql-client package on a machine, there will be no local server. you get a command line client and can run it with --host and --port (and --user and --password) options to connect to a different host that runs the server
[17:55:25] <Isotopp> cart_: mysql uses the tcp port 3306 to communicate.
[17:55:42] <Isotopp> cart_: mysql works better if the client is the same version or newer than the server
[17:56:18] <Isotopp> cart_: common problems with default server installations are missing firewall holes and/or the server only listening on the loopback interface.
[17:56:32] <Isotopp> cart_: you can use netcat to connect to a server to see if the server listens in general.
[17:57:44] <Isotopp> https://pastebin.com/ygaiLNvM I am using netcat to connect to a remote mysql server to see if it listens in general.
[17:59:00] <Isotopp> https://pastebin.com/eiuRryNM I am using the mysql command line client on a local laptop to connect to a remote mysql server at --host 192.168.1.10, using the --user kris and asking for a connection password. the target default database is also named kris
[18:15:38] <cart_> Isotopp: Thanks allot! Reading that jarred a couple of memories
[18:16:30] *** Parts: Bushcat (~Goondog@user/bushmaster) (later folks)
[18:17:11] <cart_> Isotopp: that netcat command worked yea
[18:18:58] <cart_> Isotopp: So lets say your username and password is USER and PASS and your remote DB IP is 192.168.x.y and port is 3333. How would you set up a SQL Command using MySQL to NOT prompt for a password and just connect?
[18:19:29] <Naktibalda> --password=PASSWORD
[18:20:57] <Naktibalda> you can set password in configuration file too
[18:21:00] <Isotopp> ^^ this
[18:21:21] <Caterpillar> while debugging a procedure that does not return a value that I was expecting, I started to search what is the difference between procedure and function and at [1] there is written that a procedure does not return a value. I think this is not true since among the arguments of a procedure you can set  "OUT foo_attribute" in order to specify an argument that has to return...      What do you think about?   [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/
[18:21:22] <Caterpillar> 3744209/mysql-stored-procedure-vs-function-which-would-i-use-when
[18:22:13] <Naktibalda> Caterpillar: procedure assigns value for that variable
[18:22:15] <Isotopp> cart_: https://pastebin.com/6JEF8FYW I am using a $HOME/.my.cnf file (windows uses my.ini). The file sets the same options as command line options of the same name would use
[18:22:40] <Isotopp> note that I also configure a prompt, and I set the show-warnings option (which I recommend)
[18:22:44] <Naktibalda> Caterpillar: function can be used in SQL statement and return different result in each invokation
[18:22:59] <Naktibalda> procedure can only be called
[18:23:22] <Isotopp> Caterpillar: an OUT parameter is actually a reference to a value ("pass-by-reference" parameter)
[18:23:42] <Isotopp> Caterpillar: an IN parameter is a pass-by-value thing
[18:23:50] <Caterpillar> right! So a procedure can return a value
[18:24:00] <Isotopp> No, that is not returning a value
[18:24:01] <Naktibalda> not return
[18:24:04] <Isotopp> that is allowing side effects
[18:24:15] <Isotopp> that is an extremely different thing
[18:25:23] <Isotopp> In C, int thefunction(int *refpar) {} <- the functtion returns an int, and takes a pointer (references) to an int as a parameter. it may or may not write to the value pointed to by refpar, but it will return a (copy of) int
[18:25:58] <Isotopp> writing to the value pointed to by refpar is a side effect, not a return
[18:26:07] <Isotopp> it is also not a result, but a modification of the environment
[18:26:18] <Isotopp> how that is different you learn the moment thefunction() is recursive.
[18:27:08] <Isotopp> also, as always, what Naktibalda says. you can SELECT afunction(somecol) FROM t; but you can only CALL aprocedure();
[18:27:55] <Caterpillar> so for example if I have this procedure  https://paste.centos.org/view/b847ff67     and I run a command like      call get_return_value_test('user', 21, @out_value);    should I get value '1' ? At the moment I am getting NULL
[18:28:47] <Naktibalda> player_id and @player_id are different variables
[18:31:25] <Isotopp> my general recommendation is to stay away from code in the database in the context of applications. you are just going to hurt yourself and others. code in the database may have its use for a DBA, but even then I am sceptical.
[18:31:27] <Caterpillar> Naktibalda: thank you very much, I replaced     SELECT @player_id;   with   SELECT player_id;   and now it works
[18:31:29] <Isotopp> twice so for MySQL.
[18:31:31] <Isotopp> Do not do this.
[18:31:54] <Isotopp> Write an application in the host language that emits SQL to database connections. do not use procedures and functions.
[18:31:58] <Isotopp> I can explain if you want
[18:32:16] <Caterpillar> Isotopp: thx but in this moment I need to practice with such stuff
[18:32:41] <Isotopp> that is okay, just do not ever do it again after you have learned it.
[18:32:50] <Azundris> :-D
[18:33:15] <Isotopp> mysql does not compile this, but at best stores the parsed code in the connections memory. it is very very slow, comparable to php3.
[18:33:44] <Isotopp> it is also an awful language combining the elegance of cobol with the practicality of a 6 ft spoon for eating
[18:34:28] <Isotopp> it makes deployments a nightmare because database upgrades and application code upgrades not often have to happen in lockstep. this means downtime, complicated rolllback plans, lost revenue and night shifts
[18:35:10] <Isotopp> it also makes things undebuggable, because now (and with triggers) you get mysterious action at a distance. developers looking at their git checkouts will no longer see all the code that is running when they do a thing.
[18:35:57] <Isotopp> Caterpillar: I had to learn that to get certification for mysql, but in my consulting carreer always strongly urged people to NOT DO THIS EVER
[18:38:17] <cart_> Naktibalda: Isotopp  as in    #mysql --username=USER --password=PASS -h "192.168.x.y" -P 3333 ?
[18:38:48] <Isotopp> that should work
[18:43:29] <Azundris> So should I!
[18:47:21] <cart_> Ok that did work accept theres a couple of flags wrong. Its --user and not --username. The -p for port should be -P
[18:47:40] <Isotopp> Azundris: Dann mal husch!
[18:47:55] <Azundris> 🐈
[18:48:05] <Isotopp> cart_: use long options where possible, less confising
[18:48:09] <Isotopp> confusing even
[18:48:22] <Naktibalda> -password
[18:48:22] <cart_> Soo ...now that I have that. Could I possible incorporate mysql -h "192.168.y.x" -P 3333 --user=USER --password=PASS  << "RUN_THIS_SCRIPT.sql"
[18:48:28] <cart_> Isotopp: definitely!
[18:48:38] <Isotopp> cart_: yes, that is one way to do it.
[18:49:17] <Isotopp> cart_: and better than nothing. mind you, this won't have error checking. it is better to write a small piece of python that does the thing, sends each command and checks for problems after each command
[18:49:54] <Naktibalda> oh, it will let you know if some statement failed
[18:50:03] <Isotopp> and then not stop
[18:50:37] <Naktibalda> I hardly ever use it, but I think that it stops by default and --force makes it continue
[18:51:23] <Naktibalda> --force  Continue even if an SQL error occurs.
[18:51:58] <Isotopp> I stand corrected.

[19:56:24] <ph88> oh that's good advice
[19:58:51] <ph88> when i have mariadb 10.6.4 and upgrade to mariadb 10.6.5 then no mysql_upgrade is needed ?

[20:04:05] <cart_> If I have a script but the script does not mention the DB it just mentiones the TABLES to create. Can I run it in and give the DB name inside the CLI command like -> mysql -h "192.168.y.x" -P 3333 --user=USER --password=PASS MyDatabase  << "RUN_THIS_SCRIPT.sql" ?
[20:04:53] <Naktibalda> ph88: that's right, only when you upgrade to 10.7
[20:05:10] <Naktibalda> cart_: yes you can
[20:06:37] <Isotopp> ph88: each versiion of mysql or mariadb comes with release notes
[20:06:48] <Isotopp> it is rather important to read them BEFORE THE UPGRADE
[20:06:55] <Isotopp> even for minor upgrades
[20:07:26] <Isotopp> if you find that taking too much time, search for incompatible and search for security
[20:07:35] <Isotopp> but really, read it all.

[20:33:13] <cart_> Naktibalda: So when running a script into a db via CLI .... whats the difference between < script.sql and << script.sql  ?
[20:33:53] <Naktibalda> it is a shell question, probably no difference
[20:37:12] <Naktibalda> does << work ?

[20:51:54] <cart_> Isotopp: Is it possible to pass in a small SQL query using mysql -h "192.168.y.x" -P 3333 --user=USER --password=PASS "QUERY etc etc " ?
[20:54:45] <cart_> Turns out its as easy as -e "query" flag

[21:21:29] <cart_> Isotopp: Hey why do I get this error when in my DB it clearly exists and other scripts got to actually add it ->

[21:24:05] <cart_> Hmm I think at that stage it might actually not exist yet.. let me just make sure
