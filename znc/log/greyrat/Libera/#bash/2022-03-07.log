[00:26:48] <rsmith31415> hi there... Does anyone know what could be causing an issue in which Ctrl+p shows a malformed version of the previous command? This can be seen more clearly in this image: https://i.imgur.com/DkeKjPh.png.  All of the commands were retrieved via Ctrl-p and the last one shows the text "OSUT" as a combination of the previous commands (PUT and POST). It is possible to replicate this in gnome-terminal and alacritty (with and without
[00:26:49] <rsmith31415> tmux, with the default .bashrc and without .inputrc modifications). Thanks!

[00:45:22] <phogg> curiously if I don't have the same long input line it doesn't seem to happen
[00:46:29] <phogg> I made this so I could test without hitting a remote site or needing curl: https://termbin.com/y1sl
[00:46:41] <phogg> can reproduce with that given the original 3 input lines (GET/POST/PUT)
[00:46:41] <geirha> curl() { command curl "$@" ; printf '\n' ; }
[00:47:13] <geirha> curl() { local rs ; command curl "$@" ; rs=$? ; printf '\n' ; return "$rs" ; }
[00:47:42] <phogg> with an extra newline it does indeed not happen
[00:47:55] <rsmith31415> I also noticed this usually happens with long command. I'm searching for bugs related to readline's previous-history feature
[00:48:13] <rsmith31415> Interesting. I'm sure this is a known bug.
[00:48:35] <larryv> i'm fairly sure it's not considered a bug
[00:48:42] <larryv> and it's not specific to previous-history
[00:49:09] <phogg> it doesn't actually corrupt the input line either, it just *looks* wrong
[00:49:15] <rsmith31415> Why wouldn't it be considered a bug?
[00:49:55] <rsmith31415> Oh, actually, it corrupts the input in some instances. If I press Ctrl-L, then the input gets "fixed"
[00:50:00] <phogg> and if you notice it, then hit down arrow to return to an empty prompt, then up arrow again, it is no longer incorrect
[00:50:38] <phogg> rsmith31415: that's not the same thing

[00:51:11] <phogg> when it's displayed wrong of course C-l "fixes" it, but anything you see after is the same you would have gotten if you had just hit enter
[00:51:17] <rsmith31415> right, down arrow + up arrow  also fixes the input
[00:51:19] <larryv> Chet doesn't consider it readline's problem if the prompt doesn't start in the right place due to some external command not leaving the cursor in the first column
[00:52:57] <rsmith31415> I think that's fair. The prompt initial position is certainly not a problem, but the messed up character is a problem. As I said, it is not a visual inconvenience. It actually modifies the input.
[00:53:35] <geirha> only when you try to edit the line

[04:20:25] <Tach> I'm doing something wrong, I need to +1 the result of the THISFOO and put a p behind it for sed, anyone an idea ? ${THISFOO:0:1}+1'p' I even tried to escape p
[04:21:07] <larryv> what's in THISFOO?
[04:22:08] <Tach> larryv number
[04:22:18] <Tach> so 5 needs to become 6
[04:22:21] <larryv> so why are you trying to grab the first character out of it?
[04:22:38] <Tach> yeah sorry, did something wrong :)

[04:25:56] <larryv> you just said the variable contains a number
[04:25:57] <Tach> as that comes back from grep
[04:26:00] <Tach> grep -n
[04:26:10] <larryv> so it DOESN'T contain a number
[04:26:16] <Tach> nah no, sorry wrong from my side
[04:26:19] <larryv> it contains a number and a bunch of other crap
[04:26:23] <Tach> yap indeed

[04:28:55] <Tach> yes nice! good solution!
[04:29:46] <Tach> larryv thanks a lot!

[15:52:03] <guardian> hello, I have a beginner question about quoting.
[15:52:17] *** Joins: unop (~unop@195.91.20.32)
[15:52:35] <guardian> long story: we have a shell script that can run under cygwin and which ultimately calls the python native windows executable
[15:52:45] <guardian> a windows executable consumes paths with backslash
[15:52:57] <guardian> we have script that does libclang_path='C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\libclang.dll'
[15:53:09] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:53:09] <guardian> the right hand part of the assignment comes from other scripting invocation
[15:53:26] *** Quits: memphisto (~memphisto@91.195.38.11) (Quit: Client closed)
[15:53:31] <guardian> the beginner question: is there a way to dereference $libclang_path in a way that preserves backslashes?
[15:54:14] <koollman> advanced windows technique: most path with \ are also valid using /, if you want to avoid complex interactions ;)
[15:55:27] <koollman> guardian: but anyway, backslashes are preserved in the variable and its usage already. they may be interpreted by something else, however

[15:56:56] <koollman> guardian: if you do : echo $libclang_path, you see that they are indeed there, and not intrepreted :)
[15:57:18] <guardian> yeah I just realized variables are preserved

[15:57:37] <Soliton> of course  echo $var  is about the worst test you can do if you want to see actual content of a variable.
[15:57:51] <koollman> Soliton: still good enough to show my point :)
[15:57:52] <guardian> but if I do echo $libclang_path I get
[15:57:54] <guardian> C:\Program Files\LLVin\libclang.dll
[15:58:00] <Soliton> in this specific case, sure.
[15:58:02] <guardian> it "works" with printf though
[15:58:13] <Soliton> so what is the issue?
[15:58:22] <Soliton> what does printf output?
[15:58:26] <guardian> what's the preferre pastebin?
[15:58:28] <guardian> preferred
[15:58:31] <Soliton> !paste

[15:58:44] <koollman> printf would be annoyed by the space, mostly. but you can do : printf "%s\n" "$libclang_path"
[15:59:15] <Soliton> did you inject the variable into the printf format string?

[15:59:44] <checkbot> guardian: I think the problem is on line 11. Quotes/backslashes will be treated literally. Rewrite using set/"$@" or functions. See 3 issues on https://shellcheck.net/?id=cb56184
[15:59:45] <Soliton> that is not what i would guess from "works" tohugh.
[15:59:54] <ormaaj> cygpath -u "$libclang_path"
[16:00:17] <Soliton> guardian: remove the FLAGS variable and call test normally.
[16:00:24] <guardian> How can I pass $FLAGS without a cut between Program and Files

[16:00:31] <guardian> I wrongly attributed that to the backslashes

[16:01:44] <guardian> ok will look at the wiki page thanks
[16:01:44] <Soliton> and if this is an env variable then the design is broken.
[16:01:52] <guardian> no it's not an env variable
[16:02:01] <Soliton> !caps
[16:02:01] <greybot> By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html

[18:28:00] <chilversc> seem like curl isn't very script friendly if you want to treat 404 separately to other status codes

[18:29:29] <Soliton> well, seems very specific to single out 404. you can make curl print the status code so you can capture it and do whatever you want.

[18:30:01] <chilversc> trouble is I'm not downloading a file with curl, I'm reading into a variable, so now I need to put both stderr and stdout into separate variables
[18:31:14] <OnlineCop> If `IFS=$' \t\n'` then wouldn't `declare -p IFS` show its contents incorrectly? Would I have to `printf %q "$IFS"` to see it properly?

[18:31:23] <Soliton> what's in stderr that you want to capture?
[18:31:26] <chilversc> e.g.; version="$(curl -sf http://...)", in this case I want 404 to be an empty string instead of an error, but any other 4xx should still be an issue
[18:31:36] <OnlineCop> If that's the case, then what would be the best way to print a function that contains $'...' ?
[18:32:11] <Soliton> OnlineCop: depends what you mean with properly. both show it differently.

[18:35:05] <OnlineCop> I guess: how do I print a function so special characters are converted into a human-readable state, like with `${var@Q}` or `printf %q "$var"` ?
[18:35:45] <chilversc> Soliton: without -f any random error will just dump the text into version, which is often a whole load of HTML, and I have no way to easily tell that curl failed

[18:36:41] <homogol> I have a question about faq1
[18:36:55] <Soliton> no idea how you could possibly mix it in.
[18:37:01] <homogol> while read -r line; do
[18:37:03] <homogol>   cat > ignoredfile
[18:37:04] <homogol>   printf '%s\n' "$line"
[18:37:06] <homogol> done < "$file"
[18:37:10] <homogol> I  don't understand this code
[18:37:14] <homogol> and how it works
[18:37:26] <Soliton> it doesn't make sense.
[18:37:30] <Soliton> what should it do?
[18:37:34] *** Joins: seninha (~chatzilla@user/seninha)
[18:37:41] <Soliton> specifically what should cat do?
[18:37:54] <homogol> from faq1 "will only print the contents of the first line, with the remaining contents going to "ignoredfile", as cat slurps up all available input. "
[18:38:08] <Soliton> if you just want to redirect the output to a file then put that redirection on the loop instead.
[18:38:32] <homogol> I just want to understand this example
[18:38:39] <Soliton> ok, so if that is intended then there you go?
[18:38:42] <chilversc> Soliton: the output from curl is going into the variable "version", if I include; -w "%{http_code}" so that I can see the http status code then that just gets appended to stdout, so it also ends up in the version
[18:38:55] <chilversc> there's no easy way to separate that out either
[18:38:57] <Soliton> read reads a line. cat reads the rest on the first iteration.
[18:39:15] <Soliton> next iteration there is nothing left to read.
[18:39:18] <homogol> how just the first word going to be ignored from cat , that I don't understand
[18:39:28] <Soliton> not the first word, the first line.
[18:39:28] <homogol> first line*
[18:39:38] <Soliton> again, read reads a line.
[18:39:50] <homogol> yeah mb
[18:40:45] <Soliton> chilversc: thus you can trivial cut the status code off. i would suggest to add a newline but i guess you can assume it's 3 digits as well.
[18:41:14] <homogol> Thank you Soliton
[18:41:31] <chilversc> e.g., version="$(curl -s http://... -w "%{http_code}")"; when I get a valid response its something like; "read200" so yeah, I'd have assume its exactly 3 digits
[18:41:51] <chilversc> and this is just getting messy, mixing data and control codes in to the same value

[18:42:55] <Soliton> you could also write your own curl that handles 404 how you want it.
[18:43:40] <chilversc> Is there a better tool than curl for this sort of scripting? I'd like to avoid writing my own as that becomes awkward to re-use compared to a simple apt-get install
[18:43:41] <Soliton> i would use -w '\n%{http_code}' and cut off the last line. hard to see what's so bad about it.
[18:43:57] <chilversc> Soliton: trouble is the output isn't a line, so I have to cut off the last 3 characters
[18:44:18] <Soliton> yes, what i showed makes it a line.

[18:46:14] <Soliton> how? with some weird translation?
[18:46:42] <Soliton> not sure how many http status codes are common but you can obviously not do it one-to-one.
[18:46:49] <chilversc> Though I think its mostly going to be 404 that needs to be handled differently

[19:20:27] <znf> Specifically, I'm having an issue with tvheadend that spawns ffmpeg for transcoding; this passes the video stream (mpegts) via stdin and expects it stdout
[19:20:50] <xmb_> huh uhh i dunno ?
[19:21:03] <xmb_> you need a fifo maybe
[19:21:12] <znf> My problem is, sometimes there's no input from the DVB tuner (for various reasons), and ffmpeg doesn't get the memo about dying when the whole stream ends
[19:21:27] <znf> so in about 30-40 minutes, I'll have about 90 ffmpeg processes waiting for input doing nothing
[19:21:44] <xmb_> maybe run additional check and kill when no signal available
[19:22:02] <znf> I'm not sure how I could do that, as the whole cycle is stdin/stdout
[19:22:03] <xmb_> and when available start again
[19:22:20] <xmb_> well firstly by self coding all, but that doesnt help, secondly..
[19:22:32] <xmb_> if its mono software withotu config options ur busted
[19:22:40] <xmb_> else show us the man page
[19:23:06] <xmb_> you can maybe instruct a second instance to capture 1s or 0.1s of data
[19:23:06] <znf> It's been driving me nuts, ffmpeg's pipe input doesn't have any option to timeout if there's no input, tvheadend fails to kill the process for... whatever reason, and development for it is basically glacial

[20:08:23] <yitz> !hi
[20:08:23] <greybot> <Guest39402> hi. *5 minute pause* <Guest39402> how do I [insert confusing question about a convoluted piece of code to solve an imaginary problem here] ?
[20:09:45] <Caspy> i am looking for a bit of help...
[20:09:52] <xmb_> go ahead
[20:09:54] <han-solo> !ask
[20:09:55] <greybot> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and be patient waiting for an answer. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/NetEtiquette
[20:10:02] <xmb_> !lol
[20:10:05] <xmb_> see there is no !lol
[20:10:08] <xmb_> what u do
[20:10:17] <chilversc> xmb_: hopefully it should work, its the result from my earlier questions

[20:10:48] <Caspy> looking for a script for my miner server... .. allways my miner software get error and need to run it manualy coz 1 or more GPU doesn`t have 6GB ram
[20:11:00] <xmb_> so i suggest you copypaste that line define to shell, with user vars set already, then manually execute it, and see if it does show the code
[20:11:08] <Caspy> so i'm looking for a script that checks if gpu`es have 6GB ram free. and if not to exclude it
[20:11:14] <djph> !nabq > Caspy
[20:11:15] <greybot> Caspy: Not a #bash question. We're not experts in that software or OS; consider asking the channel or mailing list with experts on that topic (eg. #docker #git ##kernel #linux #openssh #rsync #systemd #ubuntu #zsh or PM alis with "list KEYWORD" to search for channels).

[20:11:27] <Caspy> ohh i understand haha
[20:11:28] <Caspy> ;)
[20:11:38] <xmb_> caspy, u got a cmd that shows so ?
[20:11:53] <Caspy> nvidia-smi to see the GPU`s
[20:12:01] <Caspy> and the miner run like : ./miner
[20:12:10] <Caspy> but i can tell them miner.. to use just some gpu`es
[20:12:15] <Caspy> like ./miner -gpu 1,2,3
[20:12:18] <Caspy> or just 2,3
[20:12:33] <yitz> Caspy: Try the man page, --help output. And then if you have questions about parsing output, you can ask parsing questions
[20:12:43] <chilversc> xmb_: but yeah, it is quite a bit of effort to get curl to treat 404 differently to any other error

[20:13:45] <xmb_> you cant, you have to manually, like u do, but i dunno curl and how to make it show the status
[20:13:54] <yitz> There's a #curl too
[20:14:00] <xmb_> try there
[20:14:15] <yitz> The curl author hangs out there

[23:34:17] <tirnanog> ![x > xmb_: it's an anachronism

[23:35:17] <xmb_> is it still actual ?
[23:35:41] <yitz> There's no need to use the x thingy anymore
[23:35:51] <tirnanog> does the linked article not answer the question?
[23:35:52] <xmb_> k cool
[23:36:02] <xmb_> no at least not the beginning
[23:36:25] <xmb_> it says this and that, not the actual answer 'its from long ago and unneccssary nowadays'
[23:36:25] <tirnanog> how long did you spend reading? "For any POSIX compliant shell, the value of the x-hack is exactly zero".
[23:36:39] <xmb_> aha
[23:36:44] <tirnanog> it does go on to provide some historical context.
