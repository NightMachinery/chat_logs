[03:41:01] <danieldg> rk4: if the https server key is also in an hsm, then you might possibly have an intact trust chain.  Just need to ask about the CA list then.
[03:43:04] <sarnold> https://www.zx2c4.com/projects/linux-rng-5.17-5.18/
[03:43:09] <danieldg> though it'd still be better to just use the CA signing mechanisms
[03:43:20] <MacGyver> Also SHA512 is faster on large CPUs.
[03:43:41] <MacGyver> So then you can choose SHA512 truncated to 256. I forget what it's written down as.
[03:44:07] <sarnold> iirc sha512/256
[03:45:39] <MacGyver> Oh my. I missed this.
[03:45:42] <MacGyver> They FINALLY caved.
[03:45:47] <MacGyver> https://lwn.net/Articles/884875/
[03:45:50] <ms7821> sha512 may be marginally faster due to parameter choice but I'm not sure why that's a good thing
[03:45:58] <MacGyver> ms7821: That's not why.
[03:46:05] <ms7821> it also takes twice as much space to store the result
[03:46:16] <MacGyver> And that's why you truncate the output to 256 bits.
[03:46:26] <MacGyver> Also get extension resistance for free.
[03:46:32] <ms7821> sure
[03:46:39] <ms7821> that's not what the question was though
[03:49:07] <MacGyver> No, the question was "are there usecases" and one is if you're on a big CPU and want a SHA but want the fastest option.
[03:49:15] <MacGyver> Everything said after that is fluff.
[03:49:17] <ms7821> sha1
[03:49:26] <MacGyver> And that's not because of parameters but because of how the wide registers are used.
[03:50:35] <MacGyver> A non-broken sha.
[03:51:13] <MacGyver> I mean you can wiggle all you want but it's not that there literally are none. Just that you don't think *you* need them, but then that wasn't the question either.
[03:56:23] <ms7821> I dunno, seems like someone asking a question that has plenty of answers on a google isn't actually going to be worried about a marginal speed-up for >40 byte inputs
[03:57:17] <ms7821> I can't think of anything where sha256 is a meaningful bottleneck except bitcoin

[19:06:48] <TimMc> Or at least, I'm not aware of any hashes where the output length is dependent on the input data.
[19:07:11] <iz> i think they are mixing and misusing words and when they say hash, they meant compressed text

[19:14:48] <a1eaiactaest> my point is to make some function(text) that would return the fixed-length alphanumerical string. purpose of hashing/compressing (new to the topic) is only to make all data the same size
[19:15:38] <piou> either you compress, in which case you can recover the text but it won't be fixed-length, or you hash and it will be fixed-length but you can't recover the text from the hash
[19:15:58] <piou> you can't have both
[19:16:40] <piou> what is the text you're dealing with? Maybe it is structured enough to encode its information in a different, fixed-sized way?

[19:19:03] <piou> ok, first of all, if it's numbers then there's probably a better format than text
[19:19:22] <a1eaiactaest> from time to time there's also error messages
[19:19:54] <a1eaiactaest> but i guess i can discard them, they don't make much sense
[19:21:32] <piou> Sorry, I don't have more time, but you should look into using a binary format. Or maybe just send text as it is without compression, it's not that long really, I doubt there's a pressing need to shorten it further and creating your own binary format is a bit of work.

[22:48:30] <slave_blocker> hello, good day :)
[22:49:50] <slave_blocker> lets say im translating a thingy about cryypto where the subject is the ed25519...
[22:51:35] <slave_blocker> So, it's said there that the order of the curve is :
[22:51:54] <slave_blocker> (2^3)*l
[22:52:13] <slave_blocker> where l is some large prime number.
[22:52:41] <slave_blocker> So all that i understand (i guess).
[22:54:17] <slave_blocker> so within that subgroup of order l there is some generator G, for wich every other point P, also in that group can be calculated as the product being :
[22:54:44] <slave_blocker> P = kG
[22:55:00] <slave_blocker> where 0 < k < l .
[22:55:48] <slave_blocker> but there is a detail that is bothering me. It is said in this paper that there is only one subgroup of order l?
[22:55:55] <slave_blocker> How can that be?
[22:56:22] <slave_blocker> arent there supposed to be 8 subgroups of order l?
[22:57:09] <slave_blocker> perhaps even 8 non-overlapping subgroups ???
[22:57:11] *** Joins: Maxattax97 (~max@199.8.13.213)
[22:57:22] <river> there will only be on subgroup of order l, there will also be several of order 2l, 4l, and one of order 8l (the entire group)

[23:00:04] <slave_blocker> i dont get it
[23:01:20] <slave_blocker> there is one subgroup of order 3l, one of order 5l, one of order 7l too?
[23:01:53] <river> the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group
[23:02:06] <river> so the only possibly orders are 1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, 2l, 2^2l 2^3l

[23:04:20] <slave_blocker> ...
[23:04:23] <slave_blocker> ok
[23:05:17] <slave_blocker> and l
[23:05:51] <slave_blocker> 1,2,4,8,l,2l,4l,8l
[23:06:07] <slave_blocker> ...
[23:06:24] <river> yes!
[23:06:56] <river> a really simple example of a group is C_12, {0,1,2,3,4,...,11} with addition that loops around
[23:07:29] <rqsd> See also: https://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/cofactor
[23:07:35] <slave_blocker> you mean Z_12
[23:07:59] <river> this has a subgroups isomorphic to C_2: {0,6} and C_4: {0,3,6,9} and C_3: {0,4,8}
[23:08:20] <river> and a C_6 in there too
[23:09:37] <slave_blocker> ...
[23:09:54] <slave_blocker> i have seen this so many times its frustrating group theory
[23:10:03] <river> you've seen what?
[23:10:33] <slave_blocker> so lets say there is only one group of size l
[23:11:19] <slave_blocker> (group theory)

[23:12:26] <slave_blocker> that means that out of the N points that are in the EC, only l points are "used" by the generator G...
[23:12:31] *** Joins: filename (~kilitary@188.242.105.134)
[23:12:58] <river> yes, so with analogy to C_12 (12 = 2^2 * 3), the generator is 4
[23:13:03] *** Joins: jarthur (~jarthur@cpe-70-114-198-37.austin.res.rr.com)
[23:13:07] <slave_blocker> but there are 8l points !
[23:13:31] <slave_blocker> so there should be 8 isomorphic subgroups in there?
[23:13:56] <river> no, there is just one
[23:13:59] <slave_blocker> and each subgroup should have a distinct non overlapping set of these points
[23:14:19] <slave_blocker> thats how it makes sense in my mind
[23:14:23] <slave_blocker> arrrrg
[23:14:26] <river> let H be a subgroup of G, how many isomorphic copies of H are there?
[23:14:37] <slave_blocker> cant math just change this time just for my ego?
[23:15:35] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:15:52] <river> oh you know maybe you are thinking of cosets
[23:16:08] <river> only 1 coset is a group, but you would have 8 cosets of this subgroup
[23:16:11] *** Joins: maroon (tinycrypt@user/maroon)
[23:16:42] <slave_blocker> yes perhaps thats the reason of my ego's choice...
[23:17:48] <slave_blocker> let H be a subgroup of G, how many isomorphic copies of H are there?
[23:18:34] <slave_blocker> hum
[23:18:59] <slave_blocker> thats because of lagrange's theorem right
[23:19:19] <slave_blocker> the order of H must divide the order of G.
[23:19:38] <river> lagrange's theorem tells us that |H| | |G| yes
[23:19:40] <slave_blocker> and the index is the amount of copies?
[23:19:43] <river> but it does not tell us how many copies there are
[23:20:18] <river> I know that there is exactly one subgroup of G with size l
[23:20:28] <river> because l is a prime number
[23:21:02] <slave_blocker> ...
[23:22:26] <slave_blocker> so you are saying that there are no "copies" because l is a prime number ?
[23:23:05] <slave_blocker> in this case there are still : N-l points that are in the elliptic curve that are not used?
[23:23:53] <slave_blocker> furthermore what makes l so special?
[23:24:38] <slave_blocker> it could have been j or µ like 2⁷ * µ ?

[23:44:49] <slave_blocker> it still does not make sense in my mind
[23:44:57] <slave_blocker> i dont know why...
[23:45:59] <river> so look at the example of C_12
[23:46:10] <river> we saw one C_3 inside it {0,4,8}
[23:46:24] <river> your logic would be that there's 4 C_3 subgroups in there
[23:46:29] <slave_blocker> there will only be on subgroup of order l, there will also be several of order 2l, 4l ...
[23:48:04] <slave_blocker> if there can be several of order 2l why cant there be several of order l?
[23:51:30] <slave_blocker> is this somehow given or known right away and only i dont see it or what?
[23:54:22] <slave_blocker> well, 2 is also a prime so {0,6} is the only C_2 ?
[23:55:53] <slave_blocker> .........

[23:57:30] <slave_blocker> then if we have N = 8l
[23:58:06] <slave_blocker> and G is within that subgroup of size l that goes over the entire subgroup, then :
[23:58:27] <slave_blocker> P1 = 8 * (1) G
[23:58:41] <slave_blocker> P2 = 8 * (2) G
[23:58:53] <slave_blocker> P3 = 8 * (3) G
[23:58:57] <slave_blocker> .
[23:58:57] <slave_blocker> .
[23:58:58] <slave_blocker> .
