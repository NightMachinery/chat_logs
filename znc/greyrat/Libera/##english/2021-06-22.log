[09:33:12] <drbean> I think the 'breaking' in 'breaking news' means that it's hot, the situation is ongoing and updates can be expected. The same 'break' as in 'daybreak', 'outbreak of war', 'prison breakout, not outbreak'..

[09:35:58] <twb> in the sense of "breaking into" the regular programme
[09:36:36] <twb> "We interrupt this broadcast to bring you breaking news: I just did a really big fart"
[09:37:38] <drbean> !w break wind
[09:37:41] <tinsoldier> break wind — Verb: 1. (idiomatic, euphemistic) To expel gases generated during digestion, especially through the anus; to fart or flatulate. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/break_wind
[09:41:31] <drbean> The authoritative-sounding(!) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_news suggests I'm wrong. " .. a news event warrants an interruption of current non-news programming (or, in some cases, regularly scheduled newscasts), the broadcaster will usually alert all of its affiliates via an internal alert/message service telling them to stand by for the interruption .."
[09:42:36] <drbean> !w break-in
[09:42:38] <tinsoldier> break-in — Noun: 1. The act of entering a place with the intent to steal or commit some other offense; an instance of breaking and entering. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/break-in
[09:46:39] <drbean> Someone objected to my 'the breakout of war on the Korean peninsula', saying it should be 'the outbreak of war'. I should have quoted Shakespeare: "Let loose the dogs of war." Actually, 'Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.'
[09:47:42] *** Joins: aranam (~aran@user/aranam)
[09:47:53] <aranam> I need two terms for pothole
[09:47:57] <aranam> one that is more formal
[09:48:04] <aranam> another that is more from the streets
[09:50:20] *** Quits: arash (~arash@5.124.30.120) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:51:40] <raccoon_dog> Well, the geological pothole would be something like "basin" or "floodplain".
[09:52:12] <aranam> Here is the context:
[09:52:55] <aranam> Wasn't it you who said there are no potholes in the city? Then what are all these * in our streets?
[09:53:40] <raccoon_dog> That could be anything. Is that from a show or a movie or something? Maybe "cracks", "fissures", etc.
[09:54:21] <aranam> Its a from a historic event
[09:54:37] <raccoon_dog> I mean the dialogue you copied here. Where is that from?
[09:54:51] <aranam> after a revolution they were attacking the mayor in the court
[09:54:55] <aranam> and then they executed him
[09:54:57] <aranam> :))
[09:55:54] <raccoon_dog> I see. So it's something that happened in court. Quite often courts have records of what was said during the proceedings. You'd need to look at that to see what was said, because without more context, that could be any word.
[09:56:05] <aranam> Its a translation
[09:56:37] <raccoon_dog> ...
[09:56:39] <raccoon_dog> You need to lead with all this information and not provide it slowly.
[09:56:46] <raccoon_dog> What's the original language?
[09:56:51] <aranam> Persian
[09:56:55] <raccoon_dog> I see.
[09:57:55] <raccoon_dog> I don't speak any Persian, but Google seems to suggest "hole," "cavity," "fossa," "pit."
[09:58:42] <aranam> are you native english?
[09:58:51] <tinwhiskers> !syn pothole
[09:58:52] <aranam> I personaly thought of pit
[09:58:53] <tinsoldier> Synonyms: abyss, cave, cavern, crater, grotto, mine, shaft, tomb, trench — See Also: cavity, chasm, den, dent, depression, dimple, dip, excavation, fracture, furrow, gap, gouge, grave, gulf, hell, hole, hollow, indentation, perforation, pit, pocket, pockmark, puncture, rabbet, rut, score, split, track, trough, well, rock shelter, subterrane, subterranean area
[09:59:05] <aranam> or crater
[09:59:34] <raccoon_dog> The problem with "pothole" is that there's also a geological definition, which doesn't apply here.
[09:59:47] <aranam> I don't want to use pothole twice

[10:16:34] <raccoon_dog> Not sure if your query was answered, but what I was saying was, and I don't know if my client sent this or not, is that "pothole" has two distinct definitions, so any list of synonyms could be misleading.
[10:16:45] <raccoon_dog> Because there are geological potholes, and then potholes out on the streets.

[10:38:22] <aranam> I need a native to tell me what other terms they use in the street to address a pothole they see or fall in
[10:39:05] <raccoon_dog> Honestly, I think most native speakers would just say "pothole."
[10:39:49] <pussipupu> possibly with a swear word as intensifier, but broadly I agree
[10:39:54] <pussipupu> :p
[10:40:06] <tinwhiskers> yeah, I'm struggling to come up with anything else people would say
[10:40:28] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, like if you tripped because your foot got stuck in one, you might say, "Ugh! Fucking potholes! I wish the mayor would fix them already!"
[10:42:52] <aranam> doesn't what are all these holes/pits/craters in our streets make sense?
[10:44:27] <tinwhiskers> not really.
[10:44:31] <tinwhiskers> holes, yes
[10:44:42] <tinwhiskers> pits, kinda. Craters, no.
[10:45:07] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, "crater" has implications of a natural hole caused by a meteor or something.
[10:45:20] <raccoon_dog> Not erosion caused by passing traffic.
[10:46:47] <aranam> any better alternatives?
[10:47:06] <raccoon_dog> Than "pothole"? No, I don't think so.
[10:47:55] <tinwhiskers> I was reading through some road maintenance documents and the technical term for potholes seems to be potholes.
[10:48:17] <raccoon_dog> I see.
[10:51:20] <aranam> Ok then, what do you think about this:
[10:51:23] <aranam> Wasn't it you who said there are no potholes in Tehran? Then what are all these holes in our streets?
[10:51:25] <aranam> The upsurge of traffic in the city is the reason behind all the mental disorders and deaths in the city and you alone are responsible for it. The people are sick and tired of you and your traffic.
[10:57:04] <tinwhiskers> aranam: it's good

[11:00:22] <aranam> Yeah
[11:00:28] <aranam> The sentence is good

[13:32:31] <kompowiec> By definition, depressions are small localized areas. A pavement depression should be investigated to determine the root cause of failure (i.e., subgrade settlement or frost heave). Depressions should be repaired by removing the affected pavement then digging out and replacing the area of poor subgrade.
