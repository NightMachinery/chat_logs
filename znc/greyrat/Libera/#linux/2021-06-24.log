[04:04:01] <c705> i guess my issue with fail2ban is that it doesn't really address DOS properly. it might stop a weak attack (which can be done with iptables and ssh by itself without involving middleware) so it actually adds little security value
[04:04:08] <sumthing1980> it is the netinstall iso

[07:10:19] <neshpion> toretto: my terminology is shaky, so take this with a grain of salt, but the gist i understand is: () creates a subshell, and >() gives the outer shell an input-receiving file descriptor that refers to that subshell. so you can redirect 2 into that file descriptor.  2> is the redirection, >() is the file descriptor, and the contents of () are what runs in the subshell that the file descriptor points

[13:52:52] <Nokaji> Hiyas autopsy
[13:53:06] <very_sneaky> hey all, having a weird issue with a new debian vm - dhcp leases don't seem to be auto-renewing. `systemctl status networking.service` shows no error logs, and i can see that the current lease is expired. Manually forcing a lease fresh with `ifdown <interface; ifup <interface>;` will work, but this vm is hosting a service so id on't really want to do this every few hours. Nothing that i can see in
[13:53:08] <very_sneaky> the logs corresponds with the lease expiry - can anybody point me in the right direction? how i can further debug this?
[13:53:11] <autopsy> Hi.

[14:05:14] <very_sneaky> this is happening in two debian vm's that I've set up using bhyve. After detaching the cdrom device, i had to make changes to /etc/network/interfaces to make sure the correct network interface was listed... but it is :\
[14:05:34] <haroon> Hi I'm trying to setup a custom file in /etc/sudoder.d. I copied the sudoers file and modified it. I would expect, that the modifications in /etc/sudoers.d would override the configuration in /etc/sudoers. For example I tried to define, that noone on the system can use "sudo vi" with the command alias EDITORS linking to the binaries and defining
[14:05:34] <haroon> "Defaults!EDITORS noexec" at the begining. I'm pretty sure I'm missing something, because I can still use "sudo vi". I hope someone can point me in the right direction or educate me. Thanks.    http://ix.io/3qXq

[18:50:06] <backleet_> how much should 250ms ping affect ssh lag?
[18:50:16] <very_sneaky> backleet_: about 250ms :P
[18:50:18] <jjakob> about 250ms
[18:50:30] <backleet_> very_sneaky: it's very laggy, I am not sure if it's the norm
[18:50:42] <jjakob> there could also be dropped packets.
[18:51:00] <very_sneaky> 250ms could be normal depending on where you're sshing to
[18:51:19] <very_sneaky> i've had up to 1800ms in games before :\ that wasn't pleasant
[18:51:24] <backleet_> jjakob: how to test for dropped packets?
[18:51:35] <peetaur> 500ms ... round trip
[18:51:35] <jjakob> very_sneaky: I'm defering further diagnosis to when I see the tcpdump, preferably after a failed renewal

[18:52:03] <Inline> can anyone tell me why packages for android would appear in the updates section but one cannot update them ?
[18:52:08] <backleet_> it's not very pleasant at least I can say
[18:52:10] <jjakob> I'd use a flood ping in that case
[18:52:30] <jjakob> ping -f
[18:52:30] <Inline> happens since 2 days or so
[18:52:42] <jjakob> or cnpinc
[18:52:45] <very_sneaky> jjakob: fair enough. The router logs seem to support my thesis that the dhclient isn't actually sending renewal requests, especially in conjunction with the fact that manual renewal consistently seems to work
[18:52:46] <jjakob> * cnping
[18:52:53] <peetaur> Inline: "cannot update" is a useless description for troubleshooting purposes... is the button greyed out? does it just say "error: success" or what?

[23:03:08] <matsaman> when more arm "desktops" are around that'll happen naturally
[23:03:19] <Shenka> apple is the only company that has done ARM transition well imo.

[23:04:35] <matsaman> that will follow naturally as ARM invades "desktop", or what remains of that concept
[23:04:40] <Shenka> Apple transitioned to ARM 100%, developers have updated their software, and people are buying the hardware without a problem. Microsoft has been trying to get ARM support for several years now, but developers never care because they just rely on legacy support
[23:04:53] <matsaman> Apple transitioned to _mobile_ 100%, that's why

[23:06:17] <Shenka> oh youre saying apps on macOS get the benefit of easy support on iOS and iPadOS?
[23:06:22] <matsaman> Apple's OS works for mobile and desktop, for x86 and ARM
[23:06:33] <matsaman> so does Windows, but Windows doesn't bother trying to compete in the mobile market anymore
[23:06:41] <matsaman> so while it supports ARM fine, nobody is using it for ARM really
[23:06:53] <Shenka> sure. but most devs dont just port their apps cross platform like that in the apple ecosystem. its still divided between iOS and macOS
[23:06:56] <matsaman> xythrez: why?
[23:07:11] <matsaman> Shenka: I'd wager most devs do ARM first
[23:07:22] <matsaman> Shenka: because mobile is the greater potential at this point, and for a long while already

[23:50:41] <Dagmar> I finally got around to ordering a couple USB 3.0 SSDs, but I still have the thumbdrive

[23:51:14] <matsaman> yeah I haven't actually ever had a USB stick fail
[23:51:15] <Dagmar> What makes a *huge* difference is not using those terrible generic thumbdrives that barely sustain 10Mb/s
[23:51:20] <matsaman> but I do lose them and give them away

[23:54:34] <blackgatonegro> Ah
[23:54:36] <sysRPL> i hope you're not saying windows 7 runs software btter than linux
[23:54:39] <Dagmar> That's going to be somewhat problematic
[23:54:55] <akik> it runs different software better than linux :)
[23:54:59] <blackgatonegro> Windows 7 runs Windows games better that Linux

[23:56:14] <sysRPL> the point is, if windows 7 ran extra nice on a core2duo (that was top of the line when windows 7 came out), then linux ought to run extra fine on a core2duo
