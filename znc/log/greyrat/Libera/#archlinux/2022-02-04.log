[03:28:07] <Foxboron> The announcement is quite important in my eyes. But largely gone unnoticed
[03:30:43] <Earnestly> I doubt it's important in terms of real world need but as computing becomes more defensive it will prove to be valuable in long run
[03:31:08] <Foxboron> Earnestly: first actual C compiler where you can counter trusting trust is very much important
[03:31:48] <Foxboron> It's a weak proof, it's "only" different GCC versions but DDC specifies "different envionments" as well as different compiler implementations.

[06:12:37] <alloy> My Arch system suffered a fatal error, of the kind I've never seen in any other distro before (not saying it's an Arch thing though)... during an upgrade the system froze and all the kernel images have been corrupted (weird hey!)... I had three, linux, linux-lts and 5.10 lts (for a specific module) - I get "blah blah kernel panic" on one of them,
[06:12:38] <alloy> and the other 2 say something like "nothing found"...
[06:12:38] <alloy> I can boot another disk into Ubuntu, is there some way of rebuilding the kernel images from there, or another recovery method?
[06:12:39] <alloy> Weird one I know, been using Linux forever and never had to do this before.  Thanks! :)
[06:13:29] <Namarrgon> update the system and if pacman doesn't do it on its own then rebuild the initramfs images

[11:53:00] <bug2000> jonathanbuchh, Tried to sleep on it. The options are zfs that breaks every so often. 5.16 still has issues with zfs, and btrfs where it still isn't stable and defrag can delete your data. There's also F2FS but that thing can make kernels die when you revert kernels.

[15:21:06] <Momentum> anyone using gnome evolution here? i just installed it and when i was about to setup my email it tried to look up my server and came up with a completely random server "mail.region17.net". is this normal?
[15:22:29] <Khorne> It does some autodiscover or MX lookup shit
[15:22:31] <Khorne> So depends?
[15:22:49] <wasamasa> I've reported a bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1294195
[15:22:50] <phrik> Title: 1294195 - chromium - An open-source project to help move the web forward. - Monorail (at bugs.chromium.org)
[15:22:50] <teraflops> tried to look up how? what data did you provide?
[15:23:05] <Khorne> teraflops, it looks up the mail server address based on the enteres email address
[15:23:09] <wasamasa> I'm sure it will receive more attention than my other one :D

[15:23:24] <Momentum> i only provided my email adress teraflops
[15:23:28] <teraflops> then dns records are wonky?
[15:23:28] <Khorne> teraflops, https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration:DNSBasedLookup
[15:23:41] <Khorne> Probably
[15:23:52] <Khorne> Is it some hosted email?
[15:24:11] <Momentum> not really but probably lesser known host

[15:24:44] <teraflops> does it even (dns) has a ptr?

[15:26:31] <Momentum> yeah sure i'll do that
[15:26:31] <Khorne> Also doesn't hurt to change your password :')
[15:26:42] <Momentum> indeed
[15:27:18] <Momentum> but this is totally unacceptable behavior ngl i'll just give up on this evolution thing altogether
[15:27:28] <Khorne> Is it?
[15:28:06] <Khorne> https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution/Autoconfig
[15:28:08] <phrik> Title: Apps/Evolution/Autoconfig - GNOME Wiki! (at wiki.gnome.org)
[15:28:10] <Momentum> totes i mean it's easy to accidentally accepted the suggested server
[15:28:11] <teraflops> it has to cache your credentials unless you want to enter then every time you open the email client
[15:28:18] <teraflops> them^
[15:28:29] <Khorne> teraflops, the unacceptable behavior is looking up the wrong mail server
[15:28:35] <teraflops> oh
[15:28:45] <Khorne> Which is not evolutions fault but how your mailserver is configured, most likely
[15:29:00] <teraflops> I agree it looks like a DNS issue
[15:29:03] <Momentum> probably but still
[15:30:48] <teraflops> if you do run an email server that does multi domain you have to configure the MX records accordingly to avoid such behaviour
[15:31:06] <teraflops> I do so and I never had such issues

[18:28:50] <TheArcaneBrony_> Khorne: im aware but i need it to not prompt for a password
[18:28:57] <Namarrgon> if you switched from legacy to uefi you need to reinstall grub anyway
[18:29:13] <Khorne> TheArcaneBrony_, then remove the password from it
[18:29:15] <Namarrgon> TheArcaneBrony_: then don't use a key with a passphrase

[18:33:56] <mkoskar> that's how it should be
[18:34:17] <Khorne> ssh-agent can not load a key that has a password without in someway receiving said password
[18:34:36] <Khorne> If you need it automatically just use a keyfile without a password
[18:34:50] <Namarrgon> and stuff it into fstab instead of using this ssh-agent unit
[18:34:54] <Khorne> ^
[18:35:10] <TheArcaneBrony_> worked on windows, which is weird
[18:35:28] <TheArcaneBrony_> never had to enter my pass on windows even post-reboot
[18:35:43] <Khorne> Then you are either not using the same keyfile or whatever you use as agent stores the password as well
[18:35:44] <Namarrgon> for that to work you would need to write the plain-text password to disk
[18:36:00] <Khorne> In which case you might as well just store a passwordless keyfile

[21:33:14] <TaterPancky> For anyone who's interested: I solved my issue with intermittent IPv6 connectivity: it's due to me having multiple routers acting in AP mode on my home network, and one of them (an Archer C7) had IPv6 DHCPv6 enabled by default, which I missed. That AP acted as an additional gateway that does not provide connectivity. This explained why my wired

[21:59:41] <salkin-mada> hi folks. i'd made a mistake when mounting my /var/cache/pacman/pkg .. so it was poiting to /home :)~. fstab is now fixed. But all the packages i managed to install before noticing, their .pkg.tar.zst and .sig files are still having a a good time in /home . Can I just move them to /var/cache/pacman/pkg and pacman will be happy? or is there something different i need to do?

[23:11:29] <myth> thats the equivalent of doing it the suckless way though.. like it doesnt do any extra steps such as applying multiple and solving conflicts and whatnot. If you're applying one, sure go ahead but just cramming patches into the PKGBUILD is not a be all end all solution
[23:12:26] <Khorne> No but it keeps you from scattering untracked executables all over your system..
