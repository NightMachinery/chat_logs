[00:43:08] <hassoon> 'evening
[00:46:10] <TheSilentLink> Hi if you make the window smaller on my site you can see that the topnav dropdown gets messed up. It works normally when the window is full size (not a phone) https://thesilentlink.org/blog
[00:46:19] <TheSilentLink> anyone know why?
[00:50:30] <matsaman> TheSilentLink: you've told it to be display: none;
[00:50:32] <matsaman> .topnav a:not(:first-child) {display: none;}
[00:55:35] <TheSilentLink> that's normal though isn't that to hide the ones that aren't home
[01:01:34] <TheSilentLink> right I've fixed the alignment but now I need to get it to hide when the hamburger menu isn't open and for the items to not overlap when they are selected

[01:03:13] <entuland> I wouldn't only partially move the menu items into the hamburger menu, I'd do either all or none
[01:03:19] <entuland> makes things simpler to handle
[01:07:33] <TheSilentLink> Why does topnav a:not(:first-child) {display: none;} not apply to the Game Highlights? It is in the same div. Is it cause it's another div?
[01:08:38] *** Quits: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:11:04] <matsaman> '.topnav a' is a descendant selector
[01:11:15] <matsaman> it selects any 'a' that is at any level within an element with class 'topnav'
[01:11:40] <matsaman> :not(:first-child) merely negates if the selector is for something that is the first child of something else

[01:23:23] <entuland> you are pretty much free to use the markup you want, what matters is matching the CSS selectors as you need them in the end
[01:24:54] <TheSilentLink> solved the not first child issue. Nearly there! I need to get them to stay on the screen and push the other ones down now not hover

[02:52:00] <entuland> there are rules which you want applied on wider viewports and not on smaller ones
[02:52:13] <entuland> you simply put those rules in a media query that only affects wider viewports
[02:52:16] <entuland> or the other way around

[19:23:26] <aiena> *div
[19:24:24] <matsaman> vertical centering & position: fixed;

[19:24:34] <Selvvir> aiena, How to center anything: https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/
[19:24:49] <aiena> matsaman: how to keep them side by side
[19:25:09] <aiena> like 2 panels
[19:25:23] <matsaman> if you use position: fixed on the right panel, it will be wherever you put it, so
[19:25:51] <matsaman> righty { position: fixed; right: 0; width: 200px; height: 100%; } lefty { margin-right: 200px; }
[19:26:02] <matsaman> would be one simple way to do it
[19:26:16] <matsaman> I guess I'd do right: 0; top: 0; for righty, actually
[19:26:28] <matsaman> righty { position: fixed; right: 0; top: 0; width: 200px; height: 100%; } lefty { margin-right: 200px; }
[19:27:15] <entuland> it kinda feels odd to have that scrollbar on the right affecting the box on the left, and the centered thing between the scrollbar and the scrolling content
[19:27:32] <matsaman> I don't know
[19:27:38] <aiena> entuland: yes it is but this is a FF addon in the sidebar
[19:27:40] <matsaman> on the right maybe is odd, for English speakers
[19:28:02] <aiena> and I want to have jump to mid/jump to top/jump to bottom as float button
[19:28:22] <entuland> yep not a big deal, just design preferences
[19:28:23] <aiena> scrolling is painful and page up/down involved loosing focus of edited panel
[19:28:42] <aiena> this thing is long its like a form with content scripts
[19:29:32] <aiena> matsaman: I'll try your thing to see how it works.
[19:29:56] <aiena> I think I can do it with bootstrap too but that is overkill. I don't understand how bs works

[19:32:30] <MrMobius> why does a class selector like .foo work to set a div width to 70# but changing it to an id selector like #foo ignore the width and set to 100%?

[23:13:30] <kevindank> Hello, how do i get the 4 images underneath "Categories" on http://tcrstaging.flywheelsites.com/ to be the same height
[23:13:55] <kevindank> if you look above the 4 images, youll see an example of the format they need to be in ('with the placeholder images) but that row uses a plugint hat im removing.
[23:14:10] <kevindank> So the row with the actual 4 images for heating, cooling, dehumid, vent all need to be the same size.

[23:31:24] <hassoon> kevindank: revert back your original version
[23:31:40] <hassoon> kevindank: and use that css code, without the red outline, that i forgot in the code
[23:32:42] <kevindank> hassoon: just applied and not working
[23:33:02] <kevindank> i applied a #home-cats before the class so that it limits it to just that particular container
[23:37:01] <hassoon> what ??
[23:37:36] <kevindank> I applied the code you provided and it did not alter the content.
[23:37:40] <hassoon> kevindank: i told you undo your img cropping change
[23:37:52] <kevindank> I did
[23:38:02] <hassoon> kevindank: your imgs are cropped in my screen
[23:39:35] <kevindank> i think i got it
[23:39:50] <hassoon> kevindank: anyway whatever you're doing, what do you want to achieve ?
[23:40:08] <kevindank> if you look at the row above which has 4 placeholder images...thats what im trying to do
[23:40:25] <kevindank> i want the row that has 4 actual images to look like the row above it, with equal height images, and that hover effec.t
[23:41:08] <hassoon> kevindank: your current version has 4 identical-height imgs
[23:41:23] <kevindank> right, i just did that with the following code:
[23:41:39] <kevindank> https://hastebin.com/panofidoki.css
[23:43:32] <hassoon> does that meet your needs ?
[23:44:07] <kevindank> it does i believe, i need to check responsively.  Addtionally i need to add that hover effect
[23:47:08] <aiena> hassoon: I am doing something wrong. If I use your code in my direct files, I don't get the same effect as in the fiddle
[23:47:49] <aiena> the scroll bar is not in the middle it is at the end and the second panel's controls disappear while scrolling downwards
[23:48:00] <hassoon> kevindank: just reproduce the hover effect from the outer placeholder images
[23:48:40] <hassoon> aiena: share a fiddle about the whole file, with the exact same code
[23:48:54] <hassoon> aiena: not a portion of it
[23:49:16] <aiena> hassoon: I was playing around in your fiddle https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/308
[23:49:31] <aiena> just save these as html and css files and open the .html file in your browser
[23:49:45] <aiena> in the fiddle it behaves right outside the fiddle it behaves wrong

[23:51:45] <hassoon> ah

[23:55:11] <aiena> it behaves right in the fiddle wrong outside
