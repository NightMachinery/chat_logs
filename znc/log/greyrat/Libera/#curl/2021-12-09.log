[01:14:06] <bagder> steerpike: you just point configure to the separate installs
[01:14:44] <steerpike> oh, so i have to manually build openssl and gnutls manually and install them.. so curl can't do it itself?
[01:15:09] <steerpike> can i at least build them statically linked
[01:15:45] <bagder> curl's configure tells how to build curl, it doesn't build anything else, no
[01:16:54] <bagder> and sure, you can build with static libs. building curl is just a normal build, there's nothing magic about it
[01:17:04] <bagder> although static builds are always a bit more work

[13:18:39] <icing> Hmm, https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/apache2 has a v2.0.53 (!), but macOS 11.6 has a 2.4.48. Seems not very reliable what is published on github.
[13:19:45] <bagder> curious
[13:20:05] <bagder> they say https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/apache/tree/apache-856 this is in the latest release on opensource.apple.com
[13:20:35] * bagder can't spot what release that corresponds to
[13:23:51] <bagder> oh right, apache vs apache2 repos
[13:23:52] <dege> it's at least a step in the right direction that any of this exist in the open at all
[13:24:01] <icing> The apache.plist file contains https://downloads.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.4.43.tar.bz2 which redirects to a 404.
[13:24:54] <icing> Maybe we'll get write access... -.-
[13:27:30] <dege> I've been roped into working on a thing at work in C at $work.. and realized it uses 3-space indentation *and* C++ style comments .. daytime drinking is close
[13:28:17] <bagder> haha
[13:28:23] <icing> 3 space seems a good compromise between the 2 and 4 camps
[13:28:46] <bagder> three is an odd number!

[13:38:34] <bagder> ok
[13:38:50] <bagder> Apple has applied various security patches to their curl code
[13:39:00] <bagder> so its 7.64.1 + patches
[13:39:22] <dege> the plist lists backpatching CVE fixes IIRC
[13:39:23] <bagder> unclear exactly which
[13:39:27] <bagder> aha
[13:40:09] <bagder> "Moved CURLE_SSL_CACERT back to being an enum value instead of a macro" is a fun change...
[13:40:47] <dege> makes one wonder if that's so much easier than just updating the codebase .. they still need to do some level of QA and it's not like they support it anyways
[13:40:59] <bagder> oh wow
[13:41:01] <bagder> wait a second
[13:41:15] <bagder> that was a mightily weird move
[13:41:18] <bagder> let me show you
[13:41:26] <icing> I think we can skip version numbers in our release. Everyone runs her own patched software anyways.
[13:41:28] <bagder> you'll like this
[13:42:14] <bagder> https://gist.github.com/bagder/7604f93fb3eca9f05da9bc8933568a25
[13:42:30] <bagder> ah sorry, not that bad
[13:42:35] <bagder> it assigns it with the same number
[13:43:15] <bagder> I reacted when they inserted a line in the enum set, but it should really be fine that way
[13:43:24] <dege> phew, I was starting to wonder what I was missing
[13:43:56] <icing> their changes are green and yours are red. It's easy to see who is wrong!
[13:44:07] <dege> actually, that's not a bad idea IMO .. maybe we should take that?
[13:44:25] <bagder> yeah, it is a pretty neat way to do it
[13:45:06] <icing> it's the new way of providing upstream patches, is it?
[13:45:17] <bagder> I fun detail is that when they merged CVE patches they merged docs updates refering to curl versions newer than what they ship
[13:45:22] <bagder> *A fun
[13:45:30] <bagder> "+1 since 7.74.0, was 0 before then."

[17:43:52] <bagder> I've seen it before; web scrapers being blocked by sites trying hard to filter them out
[17:44:33] <icing> was once on a conference where one "intrusion detection" guy was proud to brag about which clients he can all "identify". urgs
[17:44:39] <bagder> in today's world of CDNs though, its not very convenient
[17:45:27] <bagder> unless the CDN itself does it of course
[18:00:44] <uso> so I think I should fix https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8107 in https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/7600, is there a way to say in the PR that I want to make some refacto in github UI ?
