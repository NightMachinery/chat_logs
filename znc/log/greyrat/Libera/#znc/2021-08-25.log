[02:38:36] <DarthGandalf> it does
[02:39:57] <arooni> what option do i have to enable tog et that going
[02:40:49] <arooni> i mean i have buffer size set to 5000
[02:40:57] <arooni> but when i quit weechat and come back
[02:41:09] <arooni> it doesnt seem to come back
[02:41:32] <DarthGandalf> set auto clear buffer options off
[02:41:35] <DarthGandalf> it's per channel
[02:41:51] <DarthGandalf> by default it shows only what you didn't see yet
[02:41:52] <DarthGandalf> that's why
[02:44:14] <arooni> why wouldnt i want it to be applicable to all channels?
[02:44:16] <arooni> automatically

[02:45:05] <arooni> can i make it such that it will give me scrollback by default for all channels
[02:45:09] <arooni> or would that be a huge memory drani
[02:45:13] <arooni> for weechat
[02:45:25] <DarthGandalf> sure you can
[02:45:42] <DarthGandalf> change it for the user (for the new channels), and change it for the existing channels
[02:45:56] <DarthGandalf> setchan command may help of *controlpanel
[02:46:01] <DarthGandalf> with wildcards
[02:46:07] <arooni> would doing so be a huge memory suck for weechat
[02:46:09] <arooni> when it boots up
[02:46:15] <arooni> b/c it has to load 5000 lines of history
[02:46:17] <arooni> per channel
[02:46:33] <DarthGandalf> yes, some clients don't like to receive so big history at once
[02:46:56] <arooni> yeah i think ill leave it off
[02:47:19] <arooni> i was having trouble cloning this config for the pretty buflist but i had to trim back some things to make weechat run better
