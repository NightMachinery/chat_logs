[00:03:01] <kee> Speculative execution is where it literally just guesses what it should do next.
[00:03:02] <epony> yeah, all of these are optimisations that your compiler was doing previously
[00:03:11] <kee> No, they're all things the CPU does.
[00:03:20] <kee> (Apart from what the C compiler does, obviously.)

[00:04:10] <kee> Which then effects how other speculative execution works in future.
[00:04:20] <kee> This can have a significant effect on the time that your program takes to execute.
[00:04:24] <epony> at all times, it runs best when your program fits in the instruction caches and keeps coming in at well optimised cache saturation levels

[00:06:48] <kee> Either the CPU works it out, or it doesn't
[00:07:19] <epony> the CPU is using heuristics to run more eagerly since you(r compiler) suck at giving out instructions ordered enough for that particular CPU
[00:07:43] <epony> you work with nanosec (cycles)

[00:08:19] <epony> sometimes up to 10-100
[00:08:46] <kee> There are some problems where it's literally impossible to ultra-optimise the order of the instructions.
[00:08:58] <kee> But it's still possible for the compiler to know where will be jumped to next.

[03:35:38] <cockatoodude> python is better because ML is a field of data science, not computer science
[03:35:46] <cockatoodude> so most ML programmers have almost no coding skills
[03:36:15] <cockatoodude> python makes it easier to use the ML field for data science grads and people with limited programming skill/CS knowledge
[03:36:40] <duuude> so not much technical superiority, mostly social reasons
[03:36:48] <flaqoniun> for AI i figured people would be using perl, to optimize chances of it figuring out how to randomly write code itself, upgrade itself until it can publish it's own perl dialect.

[05:45:26] <sonny> On unix a exectuable and object file are the same format?

[05:46:13] <KillerWasp> sonny: no really.
[05:46:34] <sonny> what format is the executable?
[05:47:00] <CyberTailor> executables and libs are ELF
[05:47:04] <sonny> the object files are elf
[05:47:08] <sonny> ok
[05:47:13] <oldlaptop> sonny: They're usually not *identical*, but at least fairly similar, sure. It's most common nowadays to use ELF object files, ELF executables, etc. (ELF defines different formats for these different purposes.)
[05:47:13] <flaqoniun> system V?
[05:47:25] <sonny> oldlaptop oh
[05:47:31] <oldlaptop> It's not universal, though; notably macOS uses a completely different format.
[05:47:36] <KillerWasp> Normally in unix the ELF format is used. I don't remember if OBJ has the same format, but it's built in a way that only works on Unix.
[05:47:45] <oldlaptop> There may be a.out systems still surviving as well(?)
[05:48:02] <KillerWasp> now is GNU/Linux, can no longer be called unix because they are different.
[05:48:25] <oldlaptop> (a.out is, confusingly, both the default name of many compilers' output file if you don't supply one and the name of a mostly-obsolete format for binaries)
[05:49:19] <amigojapan> macOS is a proper UNIX tho
[05:49:31] <oldlaptop> It's also notable that you can't necessarily go by the ELF format being used to tell what the purpose of the file actually is. OpenBSD binaries nowadays are ELF "shared objects" (meaning the same format used for shared libraries, ".so files") for boring technical reasons.
[05:49:37] <flaqoniun> ah yes looks like systemVr4 introduced ELF format

[05:53:56] <oldlaptop> The real reason is to support certain address-space layout randomization measures

[05:55:15] <duuude> oldlaptop: can linux windows etc. do that?
[05:55:34] <oldlaptop> (libc and the kernel also get relinked in a random order at boot, to make things extra confusing for whoever's trying to exploit buffer overruns)
[05:55:38] <sonny> dlls look like executables (I think)
[05:56:07] <sonny> there's some aslr stuff too iirc
[05:56:13] <oldlaptop> I don't believe they actually *do*, to the same degree OpenBSD does. There's probably no reason (say) the linux kernel couldn't support such tricks in principle, but I doubt any system exists that actually does it.
[05:56:35] <duuude> oldlaptop: what is the name of the mitigation?
[05:56:58] <oldlaptop> "ASLR" as a general search term, but as with many things specific implementations differ
[05:58:00] <oldlaptop> OpenBSD has done ASLR in one form or another for many years, as have most other free unixoids (and windows), but they're always looking for tricks to randomize more things, make the layout of the program's memory address space as unpredictable as possible
[05:58:49] <oldlaptop> It's the kind of thing that doesn't make anything *provably* "more secure", but *definitely* makes it harder in practice to have an exploit work reliably.
[05:59:18] <duuude> oldlaptop: do you know of HardenedBSD?
[05:59:54] <flaqoniun> kASLR is interesting because there is not much entropy to work with at boot time, yet it's probably the single most important mitigation to enable
[06:00:59] <oldlaptop> duuude: Yes, vaguely. It's an effort to bring a FreeBSD-based system closer to the level of "hardness" in this respect that OpenBSD just ships by default.

[08:12:19] <arahael> oldlaptop: some things in openbsd are *much* slower than linux not only because linux has had more people working on performance, but also because openbsd people dont want to make the same tradeoffs.  though my stance here is probably out of date...

[08:18:17] <oldlaptop> Of course you could say that reflects a different kind of trade-off.
[08:19:30] <arahael> yes, until very recently, anything short of thr fastest theoretical approach in linux would have been regarded as unacceptable i suspect.
[08:20:21] <arahael> so i found it a bit interesting, as an example, how linux distrols now often have spectre mitigations by *default*.  i am not sure that would have been the case a decade or two ago.
[08:20:34] <arahael> *distros. (i am still using ipad)
[08:20:44] <oldlaptop> (dragonfly has a zooty modern FS and good SMP, and is also not inventing new sandboxing techniques and applying them to practically all the binaries in a working, production unixoid)
[08:21:22] <arahael> nice. :)
[08:22:18] <arahael> i have been finding myself unhappy with linux as of late - it is so complex these days.
[08:22:28] <oldlaptop> If that's the way to describe pledge(2) anyhow. It's in one sense basically doing prior art *right*. It's as though everything from apache to ls used seccomp-bpf or capsicum.
[08:23:41] <arahael> thats the other thing.  every time i try to look at how to do security on linux, my brain bleeds out, until i discovered bubblewrap but that is still not a complete solution.
[08:24:22] <oldlaptop> That's the real reason to bother with OpenBSD, really. Everything's blasted back to about 1997 where it belongs.
[08:24:39] <arahael> :)

[08:34:08] <arahael> apparently a lot of people get all worked up and annoyed if you mention "alpine linux" and not "alpine gnu/linux".
[08:34:15] <cockatoodude> Oh
[08:34:34] <cockatoodude> Well, most people don't understand Linux is only a kernel potentially with a busybox linked to it
[08:35:08] <arahael> cockatoodude: seems like it.
[08:35:09] <cockatoodude> Most people have no idea how operating systems work, or that they consist of a collection of software and daemons or services to support them, or that these things aren't part of Linux
[08:35:35] <arahael> cockatoodude: nor that alpine does not depend on gnu products for the most part.
[08:35:42] <cockatoodude> Is that true?

[09:28:52] <cockatoodude> Chatholics are the reason God sent Muhammad after Jesus according to Islam. the roman empire and the popes in cooperation with roman powers, corrupted the new testimant starting around 200ad and ending with the fall of the roman empire, with Pope Paul the first. We believe if Christians followed the teachings and religion of Jesus Christ, they would be Muslims and that Muhammad would never have been 
[09:28:52] <cockatoodude> sent to make a new religion. If Christians believed what Jesus taught anyways, but christainity is not the religion of Jesus, it's the religion of Pope Paul the 1st, who made the final major changes to the bible before it made it's way to the King James Bible form

[11:50:19] <epony> it's a matter of a text editor competently supporting it, it's portable and is not a pain, anymore than writing by hand markup of any type for which you have short listed and very precise and legible specification fitting on a reference card

[11:50:46] *** Quits: optic__ (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[11:51:46] <epony> an editor mode and a lightweight markup language and a system to use for literate programming where you can have nearly "all" languages (babel)
[11:52:06] <arahael> nullroute: It's basically a live markdown document, with tables, but on absolute steriods, eg, including equations for your table cells and that sort of thing.

[11:58:57] <pyzozord> as far as I can tell they don't expect vehicles to be more than a platform on wheels :P

[12:00:00] <pyzozord> or bipedal if you have a walking turret :P
[12:00:42] <pyzozord> well I think we are talking too general any language can expect whatever it wants from its users
[12:01:01] <pyzozord> but I don't agree that all languages should expect specific editor features
[12:01:11] <epony> a primitive text editor is mainly (and predominantly) a paste clipboard
[12:01:56] <epony> it was useful in early computing years because computers were very constrained

[12:02:06] <pyzozord> text is a very basic and universal form of communication that's why it was chosen for unix ipc
[12:02:12] <arahael> epony: Emacs didn't come from a constrained environment.
[12:02:28] <epony> after that brief period, it's optional to use only the basic feature of type and exit
[12:03:01] * epony takes the notepad out of your hands and shreds it to pieces
[12:03:15] <pyzozord> the lowest common denominator for communication should be primary focused on accessibility, not nice things
[12:03:16] <epony> now build a real text editor
[12:04:14] <epony> chances are you'd come up with a screen oriented variant of same editor with minimal differences on a couple of features that are minimal and imperative
[12:04:33] <epony> that's the baseline
[12:05:15] <epony> it's not the "notepad" you get with your malware WIN/DOS
[12:05:56] <epony> if you do that experiement "reimplementing the baseline" each 5 years, for about 10 iterations, you'd receive a bit more in the baseline
[12:06:57] <epony> you can of course pick one of these iterations as your personal favourite ;-)

[12:10:27] <epony> yeah, but you don't just keep it at one point, cause there are now habitats in orbit
[12:10:48] <pyzozord> i doubt intellisense in your editor will make mars missins more efficient :P

[22:24:32] <pyzozord> CuriousErnestBro: if you don't have professional experience, this is not a popular opinion. Most people are big fans of SOLID, and generally that style of architecture
[22:24:53] <kee> pyzozord: What even is SOLID?
[22:25:22] <flaqoniun> nope no x11 decoder in my old wireshark build
[22:25:23] <pyzozord> no idea, I still struggle with L, and ID are more or less completly unkown to me
[22:25:53] <kee> SOLID is based around design flaws in Java.
[22:26:04] <kee> Er, in C, actually.

[23:33:04] <apotheon> If he wants to take so much credit, he can take the blame.
[23:33:10] <sonny> I see
[23:33:16] <apotheon> . . . and everything I've heard of Lennart touching turned to shit.
[23:33:21] <kee> apotheon: I'm not counting lecturers as teachers, here.
[23:33:34] <kee> So it's more "I had one good teacher". Not entirely impossible.
[23:33:37] <bnchs__> systemd is the init system against unix philosopy

[23:33:51] <apotheon> It's quite reasonable to not count lecturers as teachers, so that works.
[23:34:05] <kee> Er what, I wrote ‚Äúgood lecturers‚Äù? That's not true.
[23:34:17] <kee> My lecturers are nice people.

[23:36:09] <epony> it's more like a pro-ponent (supportive) opinion about adoption of such in FreeBSD actually
[23:36:30] <kee> There are so many better init systems.
[23:36:35] <kee> There weren't, but there are now.
[23:36:37] <sonny> it's not about init
[23:36:40] <apotheon> "I always had good teachers and lecturers, by which I mean I had one teacher, and that teacher was good."
[23:36:45] <sonny> it's about managing services
[23:36:46] <apotheon> I guess that's it, then.

[23:43:52] <alycidyne> What is it with no one wanting to learn anything?
[23:43:56] <epony> btw, SysD is an improvement to the runlevel issues with SysV, and downgrade for operator control and tooling with binary formats and bundling, which is.. a pro-datacentre SaaP vendor move (you can't go against the IBM/RH sponsored and controlled / own3d decisions if you're mainstream)
[23:44:16] <epony> eventually with a couple of years of iterative work, it might end up with an improved v2 that solves the bundling issues

[23:49:48] <kee> Humanity's knowledge isn't finite.
[23:49:50] <juliaEnv> alycidyne putting things into context requires a conceptual knowledge, i.e. an understanding of how everything fits together. Information sources tend to be very shallow, extremely verbose, and either missing theory or being only theoretical and missing enough practical examples. Information sources also tend to be purely technical (missing connection to business) and usually they are extremely inefficient as you have to 
[23:49:50] <juliaEnv> read a lot and practice a lot to put puzzles together. Finding one good information source can take years.

[23:51:06] <pulse> there's a lot of tiny UX peeves that bother me about Linux. for example you right click on a folder in Thunar, and click "Open in new window", and it opens the new window exactly down the pixel on top of the previous window. why can't it just spawn at +20, +20 so you can actually visually see that it's a new window
