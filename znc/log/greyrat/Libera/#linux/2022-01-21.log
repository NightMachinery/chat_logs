[02:02:27] <bengoldman> johnjaye: That would work if I were logged into a login shell, but it doesn't work from a terminal emulator
[02:02:34] <Psi-Jack> Likely due to not having it in ARM for your system.
[02:02:47] <phogg> bengoldman: just SIGTERM your window manager
[02:03:10] <bengoldman> phogg: Thanks, I'll try that out!
[02:03:19] <phogg> bengoldman: all "log out" means is "terminate the process that X launched when it started." Typically it's your WM, sometimes (for DEs) a special "session manager" program instead

[02:06:05] <lacroix> bengoldman,  ref. your initial question it'll depend on the desktop / windowmanager in question, with some of them, it'll be enouhg to just kill whatever process is the magic xinit or xsession process. in others, it might be better to send a dbus message or something to ask for an orderly shutdown from programs, etc

[14:13:01] <DPA> Quick kerberos question. Looking at https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-kerberos , it seams like a client only needs to know user, password and domain (btw. where to find the kdc).
[14:13:01] <DPA> But how does the client verify the identity of the kdc? What prevents someone to set up a rouge kdc, intercepting traffic from the real kdc, and using that to log in to a linux system?

[14:24:57] <DPA> djph: DNS isn't a secure protocol. That'd be very easy. But with the config as linked above, is it correct to assume that this wouldn't be safe? And if so, how would I have to configure it to achive safe, mutual-auth?

[15:25:27] <hexnewbie> Nate-: Well, it's more complicated than â€˜it won't runâ€™. The true requirement is that oidentd is running on the machine with the public IP (which is typically the outermost NAT router, and the VM host is typically a NAT router)

[18:15:10] <DPA> But once I have verified the user/pw by other means (such as ldap), I can use kerberos to authenticate to other services, because the tickets decryptable using a known good pw/secret, must have been generated by a kdc knowing it, and the same is true for tickets generated by a kdc decryptable using those known good tickets.

[20:15:33] <tomreyn> fweht: booting off cd-rom's works differently than from hdds/ssds. to enable iso files to just be byte copied to a usb attached storage and remain bootable, it needs to be prepared specifically for that. apparently windows iso's aren't

[21:24:07] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, use root for one thing and one thing only. Specific tasks that requires root. Preferably not file managers when you can just use a terminal.
[21:24:30] <Helenah> If you don't have to run it as root then don't run it as root, if you're not sure whether or not you should run it as root then don't run as root and cross that bridge later.

[23:20:06] <ke4nhw> I currently have a ton of work in place on Centos so I need to make sure all of it will work direct port (such as config files, keys, fs handling, etc) and if it doesn't I need to modify these to work on RHEL 8. I will be switching over before the EOL I just have to make sure it's a clean switch with minimal downtime.

[23:21:29] <uwharrie> ah, that's where our use of config management was nice for abstracting away the differences between CentOS and the other distros we migrated to post-stream announcement

[23:23:45] <ke4nhw> And thanks again uwharrie yep that is a major issue, I don't want to be running a production machine on a stream OS because that comes with caveats and problems, as I found out when I first started using Fedora. There's a reason they call it a "testbed" for RHEL. I used CentOS for years since it was a free RHEL end product, but now that it's a middle man, I am going to the end product, RHEL

Keep it neat (and either commented or a notes file) and it's easier to work with later...

[23:59:51] <tirnanog> MrBurns: in addition to uwharrie's suggestion, the concept of 'string' there is outright broken. if a filename contains globbing characters (either normal or extended), the case check is broken by design.
[23:59:54] <uwharrie> MrBurns: bonus points for using an editor that runs it on the fly as you're editing
