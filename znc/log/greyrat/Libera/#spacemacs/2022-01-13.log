How do I get it to use the one that Spacemacs pulls? ‚èé @deech I am not sure what would be the best way... I think in theory it should work by adding the `:location`keyword which is used already (you can check in the org layer's `packages.el`, use `SPC h SPC` to get there). Therefore in

[18:29:12] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah well, it does not unload functionality, only 'reload' I think
[18:29:25] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So after removing things than better restart indeed I guess
[18:30:18] <FromGitter> <agenbite> Yeah, it looks like that. Is that a problem with the `notmuch` layer?
[18:31:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> No I mean.. when you load a function then you can easily redefine it and 'reload' it... but it is harder (or better different) to 'unload' it
[18:31:36] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Or a variable... etc,
