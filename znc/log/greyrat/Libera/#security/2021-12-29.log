[01:18:28] <Penguin_Enthusia> It offers the tar file and the sig file

[01:33:13] <Penguin_Enthusia> The paretto principle. 20% of the effort yields 80% of the results
[01:33:18] <tomreyn> many software developers will try to seed this trust into their gpg key by publishing the key, ideally signed, on their httpS:// accesible website.
[01:33:49] <tomreyn> that's not really a great way to start trusting something, but maybe better than nothing - you decide

[01:34:29] <tomreyn> or just the website isnt, yes
[01:34:48] <tomreyn> continued use of key material can be an indication, too
[01:34:49] <Penguin_Enthusia> Is there a way to use blockchain technology to create immutable public keys?

[03:59:42] <tomreyn> the easiest approach for kind-of-hiding your ip address from other IRC users on this IRC network is to get a vhost assigned, after registering your nickname, and "identifying" to nickserv (i.e. logging in)

[04:07:27] <tomreyn> but if you want a kind-of generic approach you can follow in this situation: you should backup your data and configurations and reinstall, then carefully cherry pick what configurations you restore. start with your router(s) and other network devices, then all your computers and mobile devices

[04:24:03] <mats1> are you connected to the router now? can you get to the web management page?
[04:25:17] <mats1> perhaps there's a network log and you can look for traffic from unexpected devices
[04:25:21] <xelibelle> i cannot pull up the ip address page, it says that it isn't supported for my browser (or the other 2 alternative browsers that i have). so i go to the website to login and it can only open my account management info through a 2nd app that i was forced to download.
[04:25:32] <xelibelle> mats1 yes thank you how on earth do i do that?
