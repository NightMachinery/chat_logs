[17:59:09] <indomitable> biberu, https://www.wired.com/story/sweden-stockholm-school-app-open-source/ what have you done
[18:03:10] <biberu> there's at least one more swede, and that is the guilty one

[19:38:46] <indomitable> biberu, what do you mean "at least one more swede"
[19:39:32] <indomitable> biberu, it looks like they MAY have successfully phished their identity solution
[19:39:33] <indomitable> lol
[19:39:37] <indomitable> that *is* rather awkward
[19:54:47] <biberu> indomitable: didn't read that article, but there are some threads on HN about it too
[19:55:10] <indomitable> oic
[19:55:21] <biberu> people have been talking about it here for a while, but i haven't really followed it, and I'm not using either system
[19:55:28] <indomitable> yet
[19:55:31] <indomitable> it seems like something you'd solve
[19:55:40] <indomitable> future-biberu sent a clone back in time
[19:57:19] <biberu> if i gained the ability to send clones back through time i doubt i'd bother with municipal politics
[19:58:11] <indomitable> why not
