[00:01:55] <MichaelLong> lz_, there's not sharing solution except some really expensive gpu versions, there's a library to run that stuff on constumer card but last time I look at it - it was not worth the hassle
[00:02:14] <MichaelLong> plus there's nothing for windows
[00:02:39] <MichaelLong> I mean who wants that anyways...
[00:02:49] <lz_> MichaelLong: you can share a gpu with hyperv now with gpu partitionning (just that my mobo doesn't support it). an alternative would be a virtual gpu such as the ones in vmware or vmplayer, but the current ones are very limited
[00:03:20] <lz_> MichaelLong: well... that gpu partitionning thing is one good example of why you'd want to run windows as a host :)
[00:03:25] <MichaelLong> lz_, I don't know about the first one, but you're right with the 2nd part
[00:03:35] <MichaelLong> lz_, no not really.
[00:04:00] <lz_> you just admitted there's "no sharing solution"; there is one on windows
[00:04:28] <MichaelLong> and still I wouldn't want to run Windows as a host for anything

[00:21:41] <ki9a> JakeSays: partially agreed
[00:21:47] <ki9a> who the hell thinks up a feature like this???
[00:21:53] <Nasp> Log4J?
[00:22:06] <Nasp> Still not sure what the feature is, but does it have a feature of evaluation?
[00:22:15] <Nasp> Also newer versions of java sandboxed this tight
[00:22:20] <ki9a> not exactly
[00:22:22] <JakeSays> ki9a: if you use opensource then you have to assume responsibility for what happens
[00:22:32] <ki9a> same for closed source really
[00:22:43] <JakeSays> ki9a: no, then you have someone to sue. lol
[00:22:50] <ki9a> so the feature is that by default log4j recursively interprets interpolated strings
[00:22:55] <ki9a> Including messages
[00:23:16] <Nasp> ahh
[00:24:05] <ki9a> that's the input for a nice DOS attack
[00:24:09] <Nasp> Yeah
[00:24:21] <Nasp> Well lots of software have retarded stuff like that
[00:24:46] <ki9a> But besides that, java's string interpolation functionality has some default hooks

[00:25:04] <JakeSays> lol that's quite the list of affected software

[00:26:34] <MatthiasVance> Nothing can magically share the GPU lz_
[00:26:59] <lz_> MatthiasVance: well virtualbox and vmware do, you can run 3d things in them except it only supports gl3.1 or sth
[00:27:18] <lz_> Nasp: are you talking about proxmox?
[00:27:20] <MatthiasVance> Yes but not natively, right
[00:27:26] <Nasp> lz_:  no unraid
[00:27:34] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what do you mean by natively
[00:27:39] <lz_> I'm ok if it's not native, I just want stuff to run, not run natively
[00:27:58] <MatthiasVance> Not virtualized
[00:28:14] <JakeSays> not sure why that would matter
[00:28:27] <lz_> hyperv was running fine with remotefx (the security issues aside), and now it runs like utter garbage if you don't have DDA
[00:28:29] <JakeSays> you're still going to get gpu performance either way
[00:29:03] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I was under the impression gaming wasn't possible that way
[00:29:11] <MatthiasVance> Possible being .. performance wise it wasn't good

[04:17:29] <_genuser_> I have two GPUs.
[04:18:33] <_genuser_> I did consider to install win7 on one partition and linux on another and just use dualboot.
[04:18:39] <_genuser_> just liked the idea of not having to reboot and running a VM.
[04:21:01] <xsperry> same. I had dual boot, but I never used it. starting a VM is a lot more convenient
[04:21:57] <_genuser_> I had dualboot in the past and I'd delay rebooting for days because I didnt' feel like stopping one thing and rebooting.
[04:24:04] <bomb> _genuser_ libvm is badass. dedicate one GPU to the Win10 VM (7 won't do), and it will work like a charm
[04:24:38] <_genuser_> you talking libvm on linux?\
[04:24:46] <bomb> yeah, linux host
[04:25:17] <_genuser_> right, that's what I have done now. one GPU is windows only. host can't see it (other than as a pci device)
[04:25:47] <_genuser_> then windows directly outputs to that and I plug that into existing monitors, so I can select input on the monitor.
[04:26:02] <_genuser_> but obviously I dislike that I then have amonitor switched to the VM.

[07:11:06] <moose> ern: If I add one photo of a person as their profile pic and then search their name, that photo comes up along with any other photo that face appears in
[07:11:21] <moose> But it can distinguish real people from the cookie monster
[07:11:33] <moose> But funny enough it brings up pictures of the same dog.
[07:11:45] <moose> I should add more black labs and see if it can isolate them.
[07:12:48] <moose> But it can distinguish male, female, dog, cat, car, truck, boat, brands of cars if the emblem is visible, primary subject color, and general terms like nature, water, sky, stars, all of that.
[07:13:41] <moose> Complex searches also work "muddy truck" for example actually shows me only muddy/dirty trucks.

[07:16:22] <ern> Hmm
[07:16:45] <moose> The feature is called "on-device photo recognition" apparently

[07:17:51] <moose> People phrase things oddly.
[07:18:02] <ern> makes sense
[07:18:45] <bomb> what did that phrase remind you of?
[07:18:45] <ern> NSA scanning pictures on the edge rather than download everything
[07:19:00] <moose> bomb: A hippie retreat
[07:19:08] <bomb> heh
[07:19:09] <moose> Never been to one, but that's just what came to mind
[07:19:23] <ern> And like Google was in the beginning, an useful spy tool, now it's just a spytool that struggles to be used
[07:19:25] <moose> ern: Right, makes sense. They're getting better.
[07:19:50] <moose> I am cool with certain spy tools as long as it's a utility and doesn't slow my shite down.
[07:19:54] <ern> They got too big to even bother giving you any decent service to use their service (and giving your data)
[07:19:57] <moose> Like this photo classification thing is pretty great.
[07:20:08] <ern> Well, google is just filth nowdays.
[07:20:12] <moose> Google is awful yes
[07:20:13] <ern> it was good, but now no.
[07:20:35] <moose> Google is literally the giant monster figure in a weird horror-cartoon representation of society
[07:21:31] <bomb> yeah I heard Google collects some data and shit.
[07:21:48] <ern> bomb: "some" ?
[07:21:53] <bomb> I personally don't have anything to hide, so I'm cool with that.
[07:21:53] <moose> Just a little bit.
[07:22:07] <moose> Google actually knows more about me than I know about myself and I don't use any of their services except email at work.
[07:22:25] <ern> bomb: I dont have anything to hide, but when they dont even to steal in a way that is not disturbing my work, it's bad.
[07:22:35] <moose> Why don't any of us have anything to hide?
[07:22:53] <bomb> because we're not perverts
[07:23:02] <ern> Nothing wrong with being a pervert.
[07:23:06] <moose> I personally do. I don't want to be categorized by the crap I say and assigned a computer-generated sentiment about my political leanings, my preferences for food, or my methods of sexual gratification
[07:23:34] <ern> moose: Unless you go 100% offline, they know. (tm)
[07:23:40] <moose> That data is used to target ads to you, to shape your view of the world but with the undertones of their agenda
[07:23:59] <ern> Google listens to you too.
[07:24:10] <moose> Look at TikTok and how it targets vulnerable minors to selectively adjust the views of specific demographics regarding hate speech.
[07:24:43] <bomb> be like a chameleon, then. watch various kinds of porn, then support both Trump and Biden on public forums, I don't know, hit on both Asians and Hispanics
[07:24:50] <ern> I live in Russia. Mother lives in Sweden. She called me about replacing the double glass windows (3 glass windows) in her house. We had a discussion about this on the skype. I referred her to a contact i have in sweden as to get this at a good price.
[07:25:06] <bomb> that's the only way to hide from the true webscale ML act
[07:25:10] <ern> After this, i started getting ads about window / glass companies in Sweden on my phone.
[07:25:13] <moose> And now I already am receiving ads for new energy efficient windows, ern
[07:25:26] <moose> ern: So I have an explanation for that one potentially!
[07:25:42] <moose> Apparently Google is so good, they know what you are going to think or talk about before you do, in a lot of cases.
[07:25:55] <bomb> ern cockblocked my awesome solution to the problem. please read above
[07:26:56] <moose> There's enough data that they have pathways that will start targeting ads. Imagine if you didn't search for that, but you did google something like "energy prices in sweden" and something loosely related to houses.
[07:27:03] <moose> It would be easy enough to suggest windows.
[07:27:22] <moose> But also you might be conditioned to recognize the windows more often, thinking of it like that. You would go "Ah ha! They're listening!" more easily than if they suggested heated floors.
[07:27:40] <bomb> can you stop using Google Search?
[07:27:51] <moose> I use DDG which uses Google and a few others.
[07:27:53] <ern> I did not use google search for windows. I did not care about windows. It's not my job.
[07:28:02] <bomb> well stop typing !g then
[07:28:05] <moose> ern: Yeah, but what do you think you searched?
[07:28:17] <ern> I dont use google.
[07:28:20] <moose> bomb: I don't! I also use a VPN, Tor, and have my browser set quite restrictively.
[07:28:25] <ern> I use duckduckgo
[07:28:28] <bomb> ern uses Yandex
[07:28:38] <moose> ern: I wonder if someone else has your phone number as a contact on an android device and then searches it, if they can assume you're related
[07:28:48] <bomb> moose that sounds like a fingerprint nightmare
[07:28:50] <moose> What's your mother use?
[07:28:51] <ern> But I did not search for windows at all because, there is only SEO results and the type of companies I wanted are not on internets anyways.
[07:29:07] <bomb> you're even more vulnerable to the surveillance
[07:29:07] <ern> moose: Mother dont search for things
[07:29:19] <moose> bomb: I don't use anything consistently or regularly enough.
[07:29:38] <bomb> worse. I just searched about making sweet tomato sauces
[07:29:50] <bomb> but I have no interest in that at all
[07:29:55] <moose> My day to day stuff is done via VPN off of my work VPN, largely work stuff. Anything I want to actually conceal is done on a dedicated machine that doesn't use my internet connection at all.
[07:29:57] <bomb> I'm tricking Google AI
[07:30:10] <bomb> go into this website moose https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/
[07:30:19] <moose> Nope.
[07:30:34] <ern> mmm bears
[07:30:37] <bomb> by default Tor Browser should be safe, but your custom-tailored browser with lots of tiny configurations won't survive
[07:30:58] <bomb> even I can know you are you regardless your IP address geolocation
[07:31:19] <ern> Our tests indicate that you have strong protection against Web tracking, though your software isn’t checking for Do Not Track policies.
[07:31:19] <moose> Alright tell me where I live.
[07:31:25] <ern> Haha, tor
[07:31:29] <ern> no. it's not safe
[07:31:39] * bomb punches ern 
[07:31:40] <moose> I don't trust TOR alone at all.
[07:31:41] <bomb> say it again
[07:31:58] <bomb> Tor Browser on Linux/macOS uses Windows UA string, for example
[07:31:59] <moose> I would trust VPN + TOR + originating connectivity on a public network somewhere
[07:32:06] <bomb> and it has a fixed browser frame for a reason
[07:32:14] <moose> And using a dedicated machine for that activity, something like Qubes/Heads/Tails
[07:32:43] <ern> It all depends who are after you, but generally, tor is easy to find
[07:33:28] <bomb> moose do you think you'd be safe from surveillance if you move around in the crowd hiding your face with a pumpkin?
[07:33:32] <bomb> that's what you're doing
[07:33:43] <moose> That's not what I am doing at all.
[07:33:46] <bomb> the idea is to be normal like everyone else, so you don't leave fingerprints
[07:34:01] <moose> It depends on your threat model, bomb.
[07:34:03] <ern> The absence of fingerprints are also fingerprints
[07:34:38] <moose> I don't care if my activity on this dedicated system is nefarious as fuck looking. I care that I never get identified individually. The activity on that machine and those services may be highly related and obvious but at least it never relates back to my personal life.
[07:35:00] <moose> That's the important part for me. I care about nation-state adversaries, actual terrorists hunting me down, etc.
[07:35:43] <bomb> you can't escape from the state
[07:35:56] <ern> You know your passport has a built in RFID
[07:36:00] <moose> If I was a spy in a foreign country, obviously my activity would be MUCH different.
[07:36:15] <ern> also, your phone has an unique Wifi / BT MAC
[07:36:27] <moose> I would hide any fact that I do anything out of the ordinary at all, except a few things like a vice or two. Get drunk at a bar and appear like you have problems that are mostly but possibly not under control.
[07:36:36] <ern> with a simple andruino, it's easy to track the wifi/mac (PAXCOUNTER)
[07:37:03] <moose> Yes and you can track someone by cellular networks too.
[07:37:14] <moose> And you can track someone by the BT devices in the tires of their car.
[07:37:24] <ern> You do not need cellular networks. You can use ad networks (private systems)
[07:37:28] <moose> And the GPS log in the infotainment center of most modern cars.
[07:37:34] <bomb> what a beautiful world we're living in lol
[07:37:41] <bomb> we're deep in shit
[07:37:43] <moose> ern: I mean I can track someone via their cell phone over long distance, is what I am saying.
[07:37:48] <ern> My sister rented a car
[07:38:11] <ern> before returning it, we emptied the GPS. Then put the "HOME" as the high security prison and "work" as some other odd place.
[07:38:16] <moose> If I have someone's phone number and could be in their presence (same cell tower) for 5 minutes, I can track them indefinitely in the same country.
[07:38:21] <ern> will be fun for the next renter if he's curious
[07:38:32] <bomb> we were safe from most of these bullshit just 50 years ago
[07:38:37] <moose> bomb: I disagree
[07:38:45] <moose> People will be microchipped in 50 years or less.
[07:38:46] <bomb> disagree my ass
[07:38:48] <moose> Like, often.
[07:39:02] <bomb> I said 50 years ago tho
[07:39:08] <moose> Oh!
[07:39:10] <moose> Sorry I misread
[07:39:16] <ern> I'll head to work
[07:39:17] <moose> I read in 50 years we will be safe
[07:39:18] <bomb> no worries
[07:39:24] <moose> I was like "What, when we're dead?!" lol
[07:39:31] <bomb> haha, maybe in our dreams
[07:39:38] <moose> ern: Enjoy. Please clear your cookies for extra safety.
[07:39:46] <moose> lol
[07:43:21] <moose> I tried the cover your tracks thing from the EFF and the thing that is identifying is the screen size and color depth apparently.
[07:44:07] <moose> I conclude it's a load of BS meant to scare you, because there's no way in hell someone is going to be reliably identified by screen size and color depth.
[07:44:10] <bomb> entire screen size or the browser frame?
[07:44:18] <moose> Browser frame
[07:44:27] <moose> Like yes it can be, when coupled with many things or at a weird size.
[07:44:32] <bomb> man it's not about identifying, it shows percentage
[07:44:52] <moose> Correct, but it says my browser does not protect me from fingerprint because I had my window size at a strange dimension
[07:44:54] <bomb> so if you're using a weird ass monitor like brianonymous has, that's one minus point
[07:45:14] <moose> I use a 4K monitor, but my window size can be anywhere between. So yeah if it's the same between many things, I agree it can be.
[07:45:18] <bomb> you don't use Tor Browser, I'm guessing, but it has a fixed browser frame to escape that one
[07:45:32] <moose> I am just using my regular day use browser for this test
[07:45:42] <moose> I don't use TOR Browser for everything
[07:45:57] <bomb> okay I'm taking notese
[07:46:05] <bomb> very important information
[07:46:15] <moose> Yes of course.
[07:47:29] <bomb> all my porn searches start with "wife", because it's my thing. but if my requests get revealed one day, I'm ethically safe in the society
[07:47:36] <moose> If you have control of a website where you have google adwords/adsense set up, you can snag people's keywords and readily identify them individually.
[07:47:46] <moose> It's pretty neat.
[07:48:33] <bomb> yeah tell it to many software engineers I talked who claim Google can't track them because they're logged out of Gmail
[07:49:01] <moose> I mean me too. I'm safe from the things, but I am a security enthusiast and like thinking I'm a secret agent half the time and have shite to hide. Also it's interesting to learn about surveillance.
[07:49:30] <bomb> aren't you on Windows?
[07:49:40] <moose> I am on Windows for my programming activities and my IRC times yes.
[07:50:14] <bomb> well
[07:50:16] <moose> I do have an air gapped hardened portable computer for things I think are extra sensitive.
[07:50:36] <bomb> I mean Windows is choke full telemetry
[07:50:41] <moose> Of course.
[07:50:49] <moose> I don't do anything I want private on this machine at all.
[07:51:05] <moose> I have full disk encryption in case a random thief or someone steals my desktop, that's pretty much the threat model there.
[07:51:17] <bomb> self-censorship. alright, valid option
[07:51:46] <moose> If I wanted to speak freely about some really crazy shit that is completely socially unacceptable, I'd do it on my privacy focused box.
[07:52:02] <bomb> I gave up on FDE and shit my Linux doesn't even have logon password check
[07:52:33] <bomb> I'm really tired of living, let alone securing my data
[07:52:38] <moose> I have it configured to connect to public wireless, VPN, TOR, that whole deal. I use E2E encrypted messaging with some friends who are into security stuff.
[07:53:08] <moose> But I basically have an entirely separate persona there. It's consistently not me.
[07:53:15] <moose> An entirely fictional identity from the ground up.
[07:53:18] <bomb> is your Win10 also FDE?
[07:53:29] <moose> Yeah, that's my regular desktop.
[07:53:37] <moose> It's FDE with Veracrypt not BitLocker.
[07:53:46] <bomb> but when you shut down, Windows only hibernates, no?
[07:53:50] <bomb> I just don't know
[07:53:53] <moose> I don't have swap or hibernation enabled.
[07:54:14] <bomb> okay, then. should be fairly secure
[07:54:21] <moose> I do worry about cold boot attacks by state law enforcement for one decent reason; I do security work.
[07:54:23] <bomb> do you afraid of forgetting your passphrase one day?
[07:54:28] <moose> No.
[07:54:56] <bomb> it's just a matter of hitting your head to a wall or something
[07:55:04] <moose> Aye.
[07:55:05] <bomb> and your entire computing history is gone
[07:55:10] <moose> Not quite.
[07:55:14] <moose> I have recovery mechanisms.
[07:55:24] <moose> I actually forgot about some recovery mechanisms once.
[07:55:26] <bomb> oh right, that post-it right near your monitor
[07:55:30] <moose> Yes, that one.
[07:55:45] <moose> I was changing a lightbulb in my garage and found a flash drive tucked under the ballast of the fixture.
[07:55:59] <bomb> heh
[07:56:07] <moose> It had encrypted archives on it named nonsense things. It must've been there for almost 10 years.
[07:56:43] <moose> I do have that still, no I have not recovered any of the files. I backed them up and vaguely recalled storing something from back in the day. I worried it was bitcoin wallets.
[07:57:07] <bomb> shiiit
[07:57:28] <moose> I went through every disk I had looking for key files for truecrypt/veracrypt/etc and testing old passwords I had used before I switched over to an offline password manager
[07:57:36] <bomb> I had a wallet with 7 bitcoins
[07:57:59] <moose> I managed to get some keys open, I found a file that had a key file in it and was valid and contained a private key for a pseudonym I used, weird stuff like that. But nothing that rang a bell on what to open the archive with.
[07:58:47] <bomb> alright I need to get some sleep
[07:58:52] <bomb> have a secure day
[07:58:53] <moose> I did manage to determine that even though the archive was .7z in the extension, I don't use extensions on that kind of stuff because it's never on Windows and so that was a flag for me. It's likely a key file itself or a solid headerless encrypted archive
[07:59:08] <moose> Something retarded like that lol

[09:49:13] <YesMan> Hi, I'm struggling with a simple problem. I have a readonly vector struct that I use to represent positions, rgb colors etc. So far I used aliases to fit the different use cases so I have a "using Color = Vector;" etc However I'd like to override the ToString() method for some of them, and noticed with horror struct don't support inheritance. Is
[09:49:14] <YesMan> there a way to achieve this without making it a class or implementing a struct for each use cases? Or is there a way to make a class act like a value type?

[10:13:11] <moose> YesMan: Why can't you just use a Vector<T1, T2, T3> and call it a day?
[10:13:24] <moose> The type system will keep you safe mostly, just don't confuse a position for a color :)
[10:13:44] <moose> But I imagine your positions are Probably Vector<float> and your colors are Vector<byte>
[10:13:48] <moose> Or maybe Vector<int>
[10:19:18] <moose> But to really answer your question... the answer is no.
[10:30:23] <YesMan> I want the data structure to be immutable and I was recommended the use of a readonly struct because of some overhead of readonly fields have when passed as parameters. And since I use the struct to store pixels information and there can be millions of them I would have liked to keep it a readonly struct

[13:43:02] <MaNa3k> MatthiasVance, oki, thanks
[13:43:08] <MaNa3k> for info
[13:43:51] <MaNa3k> is it not possible to set anonymouse type property value to null ?
[13:44:13] <MaNa3k> ex.  var adfd = new { abc = null };
[13:44:51] <edcba> var x = new { a = (string)null }; i think
[13:44:54] <MaNa3k> i need to be able to set null
[13:44:59] <MaNa3k> hmm
[13:45:13] <MaNa3k> edcba, well i was working with a nullable enum
[13:46:18] <MatthiasVance> No it's anonymous, not a nullable enum :P
[13:46:26] <MatthiasVance> You didn't define it to be a nullable enu
[13:46:27] <MatthiasVance> *enum
[13:50:27] <edcba> i don't see what is the problem with a nullable enum
[13:51:59] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[13:53:22] <MaNa3k> im having some difficulties using null enums when setting them in a new annonymous object
[13:54:57] <MatthiasVance> MaNa3k: How does the anonymous object null it is of that type?
[13:55:03] <MatthiasVance> MaNa3k: edcba already gave the answer to that
[13:55:19] <MatthiasVance> *know
[13:58:25] <biberu> evil null :(
[13:59:18] <biberu> MaNa3k: since it's an enum, can't you just default initialize it to unspecified if it makes sense to leave it out?
[14:00:17] <edcba> either it's an enum and then null is nonsense either it's nullable and you can set to null
[14:00:47] <MaNa3k> actually im converting the anonymouse ojbect to json later, and i dont want null fields with me
[14:01:22] <biberu> but why is it modeled like that?
[14:02:30] <biberu> you could just as easy send enumField: unspecified as leaving it out, halving your test burden and eliminating possible nres
[14:04:04] <Kim^J> interop_madness: It's not.
[14:04:20] <Kim^J> interop_madness: However! 1.x have other vulnerabilites and isn't supported anymore.
[14:12:26] <Nasp> MaNa3k: I've looked at it, afaik it uses terraform underneath but it's in C# right
[14:12:29] <MaNa3k> biberu, ah its working now. i must have dont something stupid
[14:12:43] <MaNa3k> Nasp, mhm
[14:12:58] <MaNa3k> biberu, https://dotnetfiddle.net/0sVKJG
[14:13:27] <MaNa3k> the second json output shows the result i want. and it seems to be working for some reason in dotnetfiddle. i must have an error then in my code someplace
[14:13:27] <biberu> MaNa3k: i wouldn't use null unless i had to
[14:14:18] <MaNa3k> biberu, its actualyl a json variable file, and its used to input data to a graphql server
[14:14:27] <Nasp> Jira as a database sounds like a bad idea
[14:14:55] <MaNa3k> so we deffinately need to remove nulls otherwise it will update the current value in the erp to null even if there are other values there
[14:15:40] <MaNa3k> *remove null fields....
[14:16:06] <biberu> omg, null isn't even the absence of data, it's a command
[14:17:47] <MaNa3k> biberu, the json ignore null is like a last measure to remove fields that have snuck into the object with null
[14:18:13] <MaNa3k> yea, the null checks could have been done better
[14:18:27] <biberu> null doesn't sneak into anything unless devs allow it
[14:19:28] *** Joins: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli)
[14:20:37] <MaNa3k> biberu, well in our case, we cant stop a request just because of of the fields are missing \ null.
[14:20:58] <MaNa3k> we ofc have some minimum required fields that must be present
[14:21:00] <MaNa3k> with real values
[14:21:22] <MaNa3k> the problem is its onle 2 or 3 fields that are minimum req.
[14:21:34] <MaNa3k> the rest is like over 100 fileds that are optional
[14:21:54] <MaNa3k> when i say fields i mean properties in a class
[14:23:27] <jmer> MaNa3k: maybe look into JSON Schema to use that to define your validation rules in a clear, consise and reusable format
[14:23:45] <MaNa3k> jmer, yea, noone makes schemas these days

[14:30:39] <MaNa3k> ah :P
[14:30:49] <Kim^J> I don't like using beta products.

[14:30:57] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[14:31:25] <MaNa3k> Kim^J, the word beta is of the past. basically everything is bete that is released these days
[14:31:33] <MaNa3k> look at games.
[14:31:37] <jmer> you expect too much... Fully implemented features? that's an IMPOSSIBLE bar to clear /s
[14:32:12] <MaNa3k> ive been playing sfv since 2016, and theres still shit being release for that game
[14:32:26] <jmer> SFV?
[14:32:26] <Kim^J> MaNa3k: That's not my point.
[14:33:13] <Kim^J> Azure DevOps have implemented some features in the UI, some in the old template language, some in the new template language, some in the new UI, some in the old UI, some in some custom UI that only product X uses, etc.
[14:33:19] <MaNa3k> jmer, street fighter v
[14:33:20] <Kim^J> And you can't combine them.
[14:33:35] <Kim^J> Wanna fiddle with IIS? Oh, right, only available in the old UI.
[14:33:38] <jmer> Kim^J: I agree that's fucking annoying
[14:33:48] <Kim^J> Oh, you're using YAML templates? Naaahh... Can't have all the features.
[14:34:06] <Kim^J> And some stuff just plain won't work, or is undocumented, etc.
[14:34:13] <jmer> I've only used the classic GUI thing for creating pipelines
[14:34:19] <jmer> never had the time to learn the YAML stuff
[14:34:24] <Kim^J> jmer: Don't.
[14:34:38] <Kim^J> It's a piece of shit.
[14:34:43] <jmer> Kim^J: apart from moving to AWS (which isn't feasable) what should I do then?
[14:34:48] <Kim^J> Heck, Azure DevOps is a piece of shit.
[14:35:09] <Kim^J> jmer: TeamCity have been the best so far

[14:35:44] <Kim^J> All the other ones out there don't have a fucking clue what it means to do releases
[14:35:55] <jmer> heh I once caused half a day of production down time because I ran a Teamcity deployment pipeline that actually deployed shit to production before running tests...
[14:36:08] <jmer> And then when it failed and I cancelled the pipeline, it left prod. in an unworkable state
[14:37:31] <Kim^J> Heh
[14:37:47] <jmer> I don't think that was the correct usage of Teamcity though
[14:38:12] <Kim^J> Gitlab is no better
[14:38:34] <jmer> I've only run stuff from Teamcity, the only CI/CD system I've actually built pipelines in myself is Azure devops
[14:38:40] <jmer> it was OK for my needs
[14:38:56] <fredrikhr> I prefer GitHub Actions over Azure Pipelines (the two systems I have tried)
[14:39:01] <jmer> But lots of stuff that you would expect just working required weird workarounds (like nuget restore)
[14:39:48] <jmer> like what's the fucking point of having a nuget restore task that doesn't respect contents of directory.build.props files xD
[14:40:22] <Kim^J> jmer: Yeah, and the solution is to switch to YAML, but then you loose all the features you used in the UI, etc.
[14:40:39] <fredrikhr> jmer I actually make custom scripts which do advanced `dotnet` tooling in Azure-pipelines and gh-actions
[14:40:43] <jmer> Kim^J: my solution was to ask msbuild to do the nuget restore.
[14:40:57] <Kim^J> And the task that says it does X, doesn't actually do that, it does Y instead.
[14:41:05] <jmer> when msbuild was called giving it the /restore param iirc
[14:41:08] <fredrikhr> like parsing the output of msbuild and transforming it to logging commands to display warnings as warnings for pipeline and so on
[14:41:11] <jmer> if you invoke the restore target things will break
[14:41:17] <Kim^J> jmer: Yeah I fiddled a bit with msbuild as well.

[14:41:35] <MatthiasVance> I tried to have VS use a different MSBuild version 🤷‍♂️
[14:41:47] <jmer> fredrikhr: that sounds cool
[14:41:48] <MatthiasVance> Miles8of9: Initialize the property inside the constructor
[14:42:05] <Miles8of9> MatthiasVance, it's a POCO class....
[14:42:09] <jmer> MatthiasVance: here, have a flower for the day's best answer
[14:42:13] <MatthiasVance> Miles8of9: Your point being?
[14:42:32] <MatthiasVance> Miles8of9: I think the error should be "initialize the property"
[14:42:33] <MatthiasVance> :D
[14:42:48] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Cool, what flower is it?
[14:42:48] <Miles8of9> there is no point for that error...! i can't initialize everything inside constructor!
[14:42:56] <fredrikhr> Miles8of9, `public string MyProp { get; init; } = null!`; or somthing like that
[14:42:59] <Kim^J> Miles8of9: So write a setter...
[14:43:05] <Miles8of9> ok
[14:43:41] <Miles8of9> what does that ! after null mean?
[14:43:49] * jmer gives MatthiasVance  a 🪓 ... sorry couldn't find the flower
[14:43:57] <fredrikhr> My idea is actually bad! :P We shouldn't teach people to use `null!`! :O
[14:44:12] <fredrikhr> (unless you know what that means)
[14:45:01] <fredrikhr> so Miles8of9 please use `public string MyProp { get; init; } = string.Empty;` instead.

[17:14:36] <sysRPN> how many of you programmers here are involved with web design? i am wondering if you have any opinion on ignoring various devices and going with fixed width design as to going with responsive designs
[17:15:33] <sysRPN> i always choose fixed width, no doubt because i ignore cell / smart phones and do no want or own one
[17:16:15] <jmer> sysRPN: that stance is only valid if it's a hobby project or you're the business owner. Every web project I've been involved in the past 10 years has wanted responsive design to some degree
[17:16:30] *** sysRPN is now known as sysRPL
[17:16:48] <sysRPL> jmer: that makes sense
[17:18:17] <sysRPL> i was forced to use a cell phone the saturday after thanksgiving this year. my task was to find a college football game stream for my mother to watch while traveling
[17:18:50] <jmer> not everyone has the luxury to be able to ignore smartphones :P
[17:19:29] <sysRPL> i found the cell phone experience shockingly bad in many ways, most notably in that ads / upselling was so pervasive it made using the phone about usless
[17:21:02] <sysRPL> it was a samsung android phone, but i was getting upsold on wifi hotspot functionality for a fee, football streaming services from espn for a fee, hulu plus with an espn package for a fee ... fees and upsells all over
[17:21:27] <sysRPL> and search results were peppered with fees / ads
[17:21:32] <fredrikhr> my girlfriend always complains to me that my pi-hole prevents her from clicking on google ads. But she does not want me to whitelist google ads either :D
[17:22:22] <sysRPL> fredrikhr: yeah well i was on the raod, hence the need for a cell phone version of the internet
[17:22:34] <Kim^J> sysRPL: What does USA have to do with responsive web design?

[17:23:23] <sysRPL> yes i was

[17:23:40] <sysRPL> oh great
[17:23:47] <Kim^J> None of that shit has anything to do with responsive web design and everything to do with USA.
[17:23:55] <Kim^J> Just skip USA and you'll get rid of all that crap.
[17:24:14] <Kim^J> It's a USA problem, not an internet problem ;)
[17:24:23] <sysRPL> yeah i'll just move 1000 miles to another country. that's a great response
[17:24:51] <Kim^J> Loads of other benefits as well :P

[17:26:00] <sysRPL> yeah i get it. i am in favor of all that

[19:02:13] <jmer> no kidding
[19:02:13] <tsujp> I've got a VirtualNetwork table; and an entity for it in ASP.NET 5. One of the properties on this entity is `public Guid? ParentId` which creates an optional self-referencing foreign key from column ParentId to column Id in the same table. Think of it this way, VirtualNetwork FOO has no parent, VirtualNetwork BAR has parent FOO, and so BAR's
[19:02:14] <tsujp> ParentId is FOO's Id. I can insert entries that work like this manually `INSERT INTO ...` and the like. Null ParentId works as intended, many VirtualNetwork's with the same parent work as intended; however when I attempt the same using my entities in C# I am getting: `The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY SAME TABLE constraint
[19:02:14] <tsujp> "FK_VirtualNetwork_VirtualNetwork_ParentId". The conflict occurred in database "dev", table "dbo.VirtualNetwork", column 'Id'.
[19:02:15] <tsujp> The statement has been terminated.` I've validated via a debugger the shape of these entities before `_context.SaveChangesAsync();` is called.. so I don't know why this is occuring. Any pointers here?

[19:12:59] <tsujp> Miles8of9 trying that in the service configuration
[19:13:18] <jmer> tsujp: EF core has some code to configure your entities.
[19:13:37] <tsujp> the ApplicationDbContext model building jmer?
[19:13:46] <jmer> I think so...
[19:13:57] <tsujp> DbSet<VirtualNetwork> and that's it, nothing special about this one
[19:14:02] <jmer> well... wait.. the ApplicationDbContext is generated iirc
[19:14:20] <jmer> you can configure how your POCO maps to the database table
[19:14:33] <MatthiasVance> POCOMAPS
[19:14:56] <tsujp> Yeah that's what DbSet does IIRC; there is a DbSet for this there and there's nothing else custom there
[19:15:33] <tsujp> So in ApplicationDbContext what you do is `public DbSet<VirtualNetwork> VirtualNetwork { get; set; }` and that's your mapping from POCO to EF entity done
[19:16:55] <jmer> tsujp:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/
[19:17:43] <jmer> Either EF is transforming your null to 0000-00000-0000-000 GUID value or your column doesn't allow nulls
[19:17:48] <tsujp> This configuration is done by convention, not by the fluent API directly. The convention generates the fluent API scaffold which is correct, and I know is correct because If I manually insert data the constraints work and the generated fluent code itself looks correct too
[19:17:54] <tsujp> i.e. it really is a foreign key from publicid to id
[19:17:58] <tsujp> it really can be null etc
[19:18:02] <jmer> so either make sure a null is passed all the way or create an entry with 00000-00000-000 (null guid in T-SQL) as a N/A value
[19:18:59] <tsujp> params are showing so once it reaches the statement and errors I'll see what it's doing
[19:19:08] <tsujp> just takes 5 mins to re-run this each time which... isn't great
[19:19:49] <tsujp> Well well well jmer  `@p7='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' (Nullable = true)`
[19:19:53] <tsujp> Looks like you called it there
[19:20:11] <edcba> yeah doesn't look like very nullish
[19:20:55] <jmer> maybe EF unwraps the Guid? to an actual Guid which can't be null...
[19:21:01] <jmer> but I am just guessing now xD
[19:21:22] <tsujp> So the column is correct in the DB etc etc why is EF doing that.. maybe because it interprets `Guid?` as `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`? I wonder what happens if I do `ParentId = null` in the constructor instead of just you know, never having such a line since it's nullable anyway
[19:21:39] <tsujp> Time to make 1 change and wait 5-10 mins for the new possible error
[19:21:46] <tsujp> someone drum roll for 5 mins pls
[19:22:37] <tsujp> OH hang on
[19:22:42] <tsujp> Okok this is for the child resource
[19:22:55] <tsujp> So back to my example if VirtualNetwork FOO is the parent, it's doing that correctly
[19:23:09] <tsujp> But FOO has a child BAR and BAR's GUID is this `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` value
[19:23:26] <jmer> ParentId guid?
[19:23:37] <tsujp> I suspect this is because when EF goes from it's in-memory or w/e representation to actually persisting that to the database it doesn't yet have an Id to set ParentId too
[19:23:37] <jmer> or the Id? (the primary key)
[19:23:43] <tsujp> Because this is all done as a single transaction
[19:23:52] <jmer> Well you could just assign a new Guid value to the child
[19:24:04] <jmer> that's the whole point of guids (no roundtrip to the DB needed to get a unique ID)
[19:24:17] <tsujp> Yeah instead of relying on EF to construct this I'll make them manually
[19:24:38] <tsujp> Well I would've assumed if EF is told about this relationship (which it is because it's configuring it) that it'd be smart enough to do that for me

[19:25:26] <tsujp> jmer FOO is created correctly and has Id `abc123` and ParentId _actually a null value_  <-- Nothing wrong with FOO
[19:25:49] <tsujp> jmer it's attempting to insert BAR with Id `efg456` and ParentId `000-000 ...` <--- the problem
[19:26:06] <tsujp> So yeah.. manually making the GUIDs in C# and setting them is the play here
[19:26:14] <jmer> I'm not sure about the semantics of when/how EF generates an ID for you
[19:26:38] <jmer> You could do it in your ctor maybe? so that whenever you get a new instance it's Id field is always initialized
[19:26:59] <tsujp> It looks like (educated guess) it cannot do that in one transaction for you, but idk if that's a SQL-SERVER thing, or an EF thing
[19:27:14] <jmer> afaik EF does all it can in one transaction
[19:27:33] <tsujp> Yeah it is because the good one doesn't show up so it's 100% a single transaction

[19:33:35] <jmer> tsujp: isn't the problem that your child entity doesn't have a pre-assigned primary key?
[19:34:05] <tsujp> if I inspect (as I have previously) `childBAR` in the debugger after it's instantiated there, it does have the _actual real GUID_ that `parentFOO` has EF just doesn't know how to do that in it's database transaction for w/e reason
[19:34:21] <tsujp> jmer no the problem is EF is not using it's in-memory GUID when it goes to persist that
[19:34:35] <jmer> tsujp: I think you are confusing parentId with the Id (primary key) of the child entity?
[19:34:52] <tsujp> I'm not I think you're missing something here, what's your understanding of this thus far?

[19:39:43] <jmer> Why would EF magically generate a Guid PK just because you've set the foreign key to be not null? :P
[19:39:55] <jmer> afaik you need to configure the model mapping to tell EF where the ID is generated
[19:40:04] <tsujp> because I told it `parentFOO.Id` for the position parameter
[19:40:19] <tsujp> I mean, I disagree because EF makes a GUID for me on the parent
[19:40:30] <tsujp> The generated SQL for the parent has a real GUID
[19:40:46] <tsujp> I tell EF that the child is to have this parents GUID Id via `parentFOO.Id` in the child's constructor
[19:40:55] <tsujp> and EF then goes, "ok, here is a GUID `0000-0000`"
[19:41:08] <jmer> tsujp: you gave the parentFoo.Id as a parameter to the ParentId foreign key column. but the child entity still needs it's own primary key?
[19:41:12] <tsujp> Even though EF itself is making me a GUID for the parent, it's doing 1/2 the work but not all of it
[19:41:25] <tsujp> Yes the child entity has it's own PK
[19:41:39] <jmer> What is the value of said PK?
[19:42:14] <tsujp> The value EF generated in the SQL transaction for the child's PK is _not_ the same as the parents PK
[19:42:23] <tsujp> So it's not putting it in the wrong position
[19:42:33] <tsujp> Parent PK is: `b89d01f2-9041-46e8-bfbf-08d9bf194a42` from logs
[19:42:57] <tsujp> Child PK is: `ba2e8f60-299a-49f1-bfc1-08d9bf194a42` from the logs

[19:44:05] <tsujp> DCd, Yeah same, I'd like to know why
[19:44:47] <tsujp> Fetch it? How/why it's a single transaction. Exactly as per the code snippet (just with different variable names, no logic changes) is how it's being done
[19:45:32] <jmer> Does any of these allready exist in your DB?
[19:45:42] <tsujp> None they are all created at the same time
[19:45:56] <tsujp> If one existed it would work because there's logic elsewhere in this codebase that works like that
[19:46:10] <tsujp> Because then it's getting an explicit Id
[19:46:19] <tsujp> Not going from EFs internal representation to then having to persist that
[19:46:21] <jmer> Well the parentFoo.Id isn't initialized if it trys to set the 0000 Guid value
[19:46:22] <tsujp> for _new_ entities
[19:46:46] <tsujp> I don't see how that matters because that's before EF generates the GUID
[19:46:49] <jmer> and afaik EF won't assign an ID for you without specifically configuring this, but I could be wrong here... As I said I haven't used EF that much
[19:47:23] <jmer> If you're trying to assign a the PK of an entity that hasn't touched the DB first, as a FK to a child entity, how is EF supposed to know it's value?
[19:47:29] <tsujp> EF goes: (1) you make the entities in memory, like in your C# code (2) you tell EF to persist those entities to the database via _context.SaveChanges() (3) EF generates the appropriate SQL transaction(s) based on your entity relations etc configured in code
[19:48:28] <tsujp> (3) <--- this is where EF is correctly making a PK without having to be told, it knows a child resource is a child resource because it's correctly creating a transaction for it when only doing `user.AddVirtualNetwork(parentFoo);` but it _doesn't_ know the GUID it itself generates even though it literally just generated it BEFORE running the SQL
[19:48:28] <tsujp> transaction
[19:48:53] <tsujp> "how is EF supposed to know it's value?" because EF is generating that value
[19:49:10] <tsujp> This isn't an autoincrement value like saying an `int` PK where I would agree with you
[19:49:18] <tsujp> The DB model requires you give it a value for Id
[19:49:28] <jmer> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/generated-properties?tabs=data-annotations
[19:49:52] <jmer> "By convention, non-composite primary keys of type short, int, long, or Guid are set up to have values generated for inserted entities if a value isn't provided by the application." <- I read this as "If EF doesn't get a value from the APP it expects the DB to generate it"
[19:51:11] <tsujp> Well you cannot just ask a database "hey db give me back a GUID"
[19:51:28] <tsujp> I don't know how else to explain that EF is not doing that, EF is generating a GUID!!!

[19:52:51] <tsujp> VALUES (@p0, @p1, @p2, @p3, @p4, @p5, @p6, @p7, @p8);```
[19:52:57] <tsujp> That's the log line for the parent, see `@p0='b89d01f2-9041-46e8-bfbf-08d9bf194a42'`
[19:53:11] <tsujp> it's not setting that to `NEWID()` which is how you get a database generated ID in SQL-SERVER
[19:53:14] <jmer> tsujp: try reading further in the documentation link I posted: "Unlike with default values or computed columns, we are not specifying how the values are to be generated; that depends on the database provider being used. Database providers may automatically set up value generation for some property types, but others may require you to manually set up how the value is generated."
[19:53:15] <tsujp> It's passing an Id itself
[19:53:42] <jmer> If the DB has the repsonsibility to generate the DB you need to write the parent entity before you can relate it.
[19:53:51] <jmer> ... to generate the KEY I meant ^^
[19:53:51] <tsujp> We're talking past each other here
[19:54:13] <tsujp> Look at the log line please
[19:54:15] <jmer> tsujp: If the DB ins't set up to generate the PK you need to assign it yourself from your application
[19:54:20] <tsujp> Yes
[19:54:22] <tsujp> I know
[19:54:27] <tsujp> That's what I have provided evidence of EF doing
[19:54:37] <tsujp> Look at the log line parameter @p0 EF is generating an Id
[19:54:57] <jmer> YEs, but is it generated at the time you try to use that ID as a foreign key?
[19:55:14] <tsujp> Yes because EF is generating it...
[19:55:15] <jmer> try setting a breakpoint where you're assigning the parentFoo.Id to childBar.ParentId
[19:55:22] <tsujp> Nonononononono
[19:55:34] <tsujp> That's not where the id generation happens IIRC
[19:55:41] <jmer> that would let you know if EF has assigned a key when you're tyring to use it
[19:55:45] <tsujp> The Id generation happens when you call _context.SaveChanges()
[19:56:02] <jmer> Yes, but if you're trying to use that ID BEFORE you called _context.SaveChanges how is it supposed to be generated? :P
[19:56:31] <tsujp> The problem occurs when _context.SaveChanges() is called
[19:56:34] <tsujp> This is a single transaction
[19:56:38] <tsujp> It's not being used before
[19:56:55] <tsujp> "how is it supposed to be generated?" EF is generating it as per the log line
[19:57:05] <tsujp> We've been in this circle like 7 times now lol
[19:57:36] <jmer> Are you setting the childBar.ParentId before or after SaveChanges has been called?
[19:57:42] <tsujp> Before
[19:57:59] <jmer> Yeah. So at that time it will be 00000...
[19:58:25] <jmer> I am not sure EF is smart enough to know it's supposed to generate a NEW value for your Foreign key
[19:58:41] <tsujp> And? EF is smart enough to generate a PK `b89d01f2-9041-46e8-bfbf-08d9bf194a42` and it knows about the entity relationship so why doesn't it take the value `b89d01f2-9041-46e8-bfbf-08d9bf194a42` that _EF GENERATES ITSELF_ and use that instead of `00000`
[19:58:52] <jmer> I don't know xD
[19:58:57] <tsujp> Me neither
[19:58:59] <tsujp> That's what I mean
[19:59:00] <tsujp> Madness
[19:59:09] <jmer> But if you set that breakpoint you can see what value is used
[19:59:19] <tsujp> It literally, like literally the word literally proper use: literally is doing 1/2 the work and then going "nah" for the rest lol
[19:59:27] <jmer> Well I guess it could be coded to do so but what tradeoffs that might have I don't know :P
[19:59:42] <irwiss> man, working on some java shit atm, the so called "state of the art" ide intellij is like complete shitstain of an IDE compared to vs
[19:59:55] <irwiss> how the fuck do people even work in this
[20:00:00] <tsujp> I would _REALLY_ like to know why this is why it is, maybe some obscure config setting, maybe there's some tradeoff only database admins from the 1980s would know about in their ancient wisdom
[20:00:05] <tsujp> To me it looks like absolute madness
[20:00:29] <jmer> Well... What about next time you assign a foreign key but the entity allready exists in the DB
[20:00:44] <tsujp> vs isn't even good it's just the mainstream normie one that microsoft can peddle with their billion dollar marketing budget
[20:00:46] <jmer> how is EF supposed to know without either having extra calls to your DB or potentially overwriting a value you want to KEEP
[20:01:03] <irwiss> even basic shit like 'run' is 2 key "short"cut, and dependency management is complete shitshow, same intellij version suggests "add junit 5.4" on one PC, "add junit 5.7" on another PC, and if the project is cloned to clean environment it can't even auto pull junit dependency
[20:01:12] <irwiss> what the fuck... for real
[20:01:18] <tsujp> #java
[20:01:23] <tsujp> this is #csharp
[20:01:32] <irwiss> no, this is c# developer discussions
[20:01:44] <tsujp> what does "java ide" have to do with c# lol
[20:02:09] <jmer> tsujp: I know this is related to navigation properties but I am not sure it can solve your problem. But maybe look at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/saving/related-data to see if there is a possibliity to do this
[20:02:40] <tsujp> I must be brain damaged, I fail to see why "java ide" is relevant in a c# developer channel in any way shape or form... go complain in the #java channel where #java is the topic because it's the #java channel
[20:02:53] <jmer> tsujp: the topic here is any discussion topic that a c# developer can think about
[20:02:58] <jmer> sometimes we discuss food! :P
[20:03:51] <jmer> tsujp: You're new here or else you would know that's the case... Basically nothing is off topic here... well maybe except if you're not able to call yourself a c# developer... xD

[20:04:32] <irwiss> tsujp: because primary comparison is VS as an IDE, which is lightyears ahead of java, i can't believe people actually do work in intellij
[20:04:51] <irwiss> literally everything that can be fucked up, is fucked up
[20:04:57] <Tobbi_> JSYK: I lost...
[20:05:04] <Tobbi_> Or rather, I gave up
[20:05:39] <tsujp> jmer yeah you can but graph-literals on that page cannot be configured with the Ids just like they are here ;)  the solution is the same in both cases: define a GUID yourself in the C# because EF cannot be trusted to apply it to the relationships that it already knows about
[20:05:49] <tsujp> This _must_ be a feature gap or bug
[20:06:10] <tsujp> I'll do some digging because yeah idk, I cannot reconcile why it behaves like this
[20:07:41] <tsujp> Yeah so jmer you know that parent object with the correct SQL insert statement I posted above? It's GUID _before _context.saveChanges() is called_ is `0000..` because as I said it's EF's job to make that so it gives it a dummy value
[20:08:01] <tsujp> So it correctly does it's job: constructing a GUID when it is told to persist the entity to the db
[20:08:03] <tsujp> but only 1/2 of the time
[20:08:16] <tsujp> only for the PK, but not for a FK that references a PK on a child entity that it is configured, and does, know about
[20:08:20] <tsujp> insane behaviour

[20:18:10] <irwiss> tsujp: stick around you'll see weirder topics than java :P
[20:18:19] <tsujp> rip, im kind of getting bored of maintaining and configuring vim or emacs or sublime tbh as rewarding as it is
[20:18:31] <Diablo-D3> heh so Im a long time vim user, literally 25+ years
[20:18:40] <tsujp> i use the vim keys 1111000000%
[20:18:44] <Diablo-D3> the schism in the community between vim8 and neovim is kinda ugh
[20:18:49] <tsujp> but yeah.. configuring vim and what not yuck
[20:18:50] <Diablo-D3> like, we're moving forwards, its great
[20:18:55] <tsujp> plus yeah neovim vs vim8 etc
[20:19:03] <tsujp> neovim is just as normie bland as vscode
[20:19:04] <Diablo-D3> but we dont have a clear winner, and we dont have any good vim config distros, and Im tired of maintaining my own
[20:19:11] <tsujp> ^ same
[20:19:14] <Diablo-D3> so Ive dipped back into emacs.
[20:19:24] <tsujp> same for emacs, emacs is really nice but spacemacs, doommacs etc all too big and what not
[20:19:32] <tsujp> and I am getting tired of maintaining my own literate config
[20:19:33] <Diablo-D3> last time I used emacs was when slackware on a 486 was cool
[20:19:38] <tsujp> especially because pgtk was yet again delayed
[20:19:49] <Diablo-D3> yeah, spacemacs and doom both look amazing compared to the crap we have in vim
[20:20:22] <tsujp> they do 100% but i dont buy the whole "extensible" bit as much as it's touted because you do have to know their way of doing things -- which is 100% fine if you want do it that way.. but I don;t
[20:20:30] <Diablo-D3> vim has like spacevim (spacemacs-esque config for vim, but also has all the same shittyness of spacemacs-does-too-much), and lunarvim
[20:20:56] <Diablo-D3> Im liking doom because it sets up evilmode and a lot of extra vim-ness by default
[20:21:07] <tsujp> protos is really good, doing stuff by scratch to understand how it works etc but then I spend all my time learning that instead of doing work ;)
[20:21:19] <Diablo-D3> I was typing in common vim shortcuts I use and they all worked
[20:21:23] <Diablo-D3> especially surprised gg=G worked
[20:21:32] <tsujp> noice

[20:22:08] <jonp> Eight Megs And Constantly Swapping
[20:22:15] <Diablo-D3> yarp
[20:22:17] <jonp> which now sounds silly
[20:22:20] <Diablo-D3> fun fact, my 486 only had 8 megs
[20:22:20] <jonp> "only" 8MB?!
[20:22:35] <Diablo-D3> you know how many CPUs Ive had that the L3 is at least that big?
[20:22:38] <tsujp> wots that meme about 18K memory that bill gates said and im too lazy to google
[20:22:44] <tsujp> only ever need 18k memory
[20:22:51] <jonp> 640K
[20:23:15] <tsujp> whats your reasoning for wanting vscode to die off? I agree just curious
[20:23:21] <tsujp> mine I already touted above
[20:23:36] <tsujp> also im giga skeptical because of the old EEE adage
[20:23:53] <jonp> tsujp: i don't understand your rationale to kill vscode
[20:24:07] <tsujp> im surprised github hasn't been raped into the ground tbh, they've done a good job leaving it alone
[20:24:14] <jonp> vscode -- or something like it -- is hugely useful within Azure DevOps, for viewing giant-ass log files/etc.
[20:24:35] <jonp> and GitHub Codespaces also uses VSCode infra
[20:24:35] <tsujp> i guess could also just type `view <filename>` in a shell

[20:24:44] <tsujp> unless you're on windows then w/e powershell equivalent
[20:24:56] <jonp> a decent editor that is usable within a web browser is very useful

[20:25:08] <tsujp> i agree it is
[20:25:25] <tsujp> because if 100% of people use it then there's no incentive to keep it good
[20:25:28] <tsujp> any monopoly is bad
[20:25:37] <tsujp> i'd say the same is vim was as used as vscode
[20:25:45] <tsujp> not the vim keys, literal vim
[20:26:50] <tsujp> i mean shit soon there's going to be github copilot baked into vscode and I bet that becomes a subscription offering later on (because everything is these days, you know you have to pay $8 a month now to be able to unlock/lock your new toyota car?)
[20:27:00] <tsujp> the problem is it wont stop at just being a good editor

[20:30:23] <jmer> it would be nice

There are millions and millions and millions of lines of code added to the kernel each year now which is an unmaintainable amount of change and that's only happening because linux is so popular. I love UNIX and how linux is UNIX-like but it's becoming less and less so and
[20:30:24] <tsujp> other alternatives: solaris, freebsd etc are getting left behind because linux is the monopoly on: dev stuff and server stuff
[20:30:29] <tsujp> no competition = bad
[20:30:33] <tsujp> monopoly always bad

[20:35:59] <Diablo-D3> but yeah basically, all the emacs complaints I had... kinda died
[20:36:09] <jmer> you shouldn't trust any larger organisation with it's own interests (inlcuding FOSS ones)
[20:36:10] <Diablo-D3> the big shit in the editor isnt even in any editor
[20:36:23] <Diablo-D3> like, how big is a LSP written in nodejs? yuge
[20:36:29] <tsujp> couple that with vscode's huge market share = i dont trust microsoft to not have a negative overall impact given their bullshit practices and the influence they have over new developers/existing ones who only know or only want to know how to use vscode
[20:37:52] <tsujp> the only emacs complaint i currently have is: single threaded rendering (gui and internals are the same thread so you kinda have to optimise your configuration or it will lag) and pgtk is delayed again
[20:37:59] <tsujp> pgtk removes the hardcoded X11 bindings emacs has
[20:38:07] <tsujp> which is important if you want to not use X and use say Wayland
[20:38:30] <tsujp> yes you can have it run in XWayland but... XWayland is just an embedded X server in Wayland IIRC
[20:38:47] <tsujp> point is: emacs is still currently hardcoded X11 and that is no beuno
[20:39:39] <tsujp> the recent native elisp compilation stuff helped A LOT with that single thread issue which is nice... but it's still single threaded

[21:24:03] <redoc> you woke up, took a bong rip, now back to bed?

[21:27:39] <MatthiasVance> So it didn't go off!
[21:29:58] <redoc> bomb always goes off
[21:30:04] <redoc> its just an unreliable timer

[21:48:45] <redoc> I have a try/catch on another thread and so it's not acting as it should, it still will crash the app. How can I get this try/catch to work as intended even though its on another thread? This is Xamarin forms
[21:49:48] <jonp> not sure i follow; try/catch doesn't know about or do anything with other threads.
[21:50:58] <redoc> yea I dont follow either :)
[21:54:53] <redoc> basically unless I do: Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread(() => { }); a try/catch that fails will cause a UE without info
[21:55:39] <jonp> how is the try/catch failing?
[21:56:12] <redoc> this time it's "Safe handle has been closed" - "System.ObjectDisposedExeception"
[22:06:14] <jonp> redoc: which implies that "something" is trying to use the SafeHandle after .Dispose() has been called.
[22:06:15] <jonp> fix that.

[22:43:48] <Ownix> Is there a way to be explicit about an extension method for an ambiguous reference error
[22:44:14] <Ownix> Because of a transitive dependency I have an ambiguous extension method in my startup class where I'm registering services
[22:44:30] *** Quits: Bradley32110 (~IceChat95@071-013-010-066.biz.spectrum.com) (Quit: Why is the alphabet in that order? Is it because of that song?)
[22:46:22] <ki9a> How explicit?
[22:46:36] <ki9a> You can call it by exact type name as a static method...
[22:47:06] *** Joins: Fiji (~Fiji@user/fiji)
[22:47:47] <Ownix> ki9a: I'll have to try that, since it's an extension method it's in the Microsoft dependency injection namespace that libraries usually use
[22:48:18] <Ownix> Even the class name might be the same I'll have to look here in a second
[22:48:35] <Ownix> Would I be able to prefix the assembly name in this situation?
[22:50:44] <ki9a> how different is the asmname?
[22:50:53] <ki9a> iirc you can use prefixes but I never tried that
[22:50:56] <ki9a> try type name first

[23:05:44] <lz_> whoever still writes python 2.7 code in 2021 can ligma
[23:06:01] <ki9a> Ownix: those a re fairly large dependencies to both depend on?
[23:06:15] <ki9a> they will probably also conflict
[23:08:37] <bomb> I made a small command-line program once that depends on both Boost and Qt
[23:10:43] <Ownix> ki9a: One is direct, one is transitive (through a third party helper library). Is there some way in my main project I can block or disable the inclusion of a transitive dependency?
[23:11:04] <Ownix> Im waiting to hear back from the library author why they do not have a library that relies on the new product yet.

[23:35:59] <ki9a> Ownix: What I mean is that IDS4 (and IDS3) are fairly "heavy" components
[23:36:11] <ki9a> I can't imagine how this could be transitive even

[23:52:09] <bomb> so, what do you do? I figured you're not a programmer from the questions you ask
