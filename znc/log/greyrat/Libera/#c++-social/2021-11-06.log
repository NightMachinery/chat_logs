[00:01:17] <jotham> a pic of it
[00:01:44] <jotham> fucking epic stuff
[00:02:16] <Bakunin> Beautiful!
[00:02:34] <CaCode-> So why does the solar storm make the earth's magnetic field glow?
[00:02:35] <Juliu> It's sad that there never is an intelligent person in chatrooms. The only halfway intelligent people used to be the trolls, and they have mental problems instead
[00:02:44] <Raziel> jotham, very noice
[00:02:44] <CaCode-> what is a solar storm anyways?
[00:02:54] <Juliu> CaCode-, magnetic fields don't glow
[00:03:07] <CaCode-> Juliu, i am not a scientist
[00:03:40] <jotham> CaCode-: the sun shits out huge amounts of solar wind when it has a solar flare, basically high energy particles
[00:03:45] <jotham> and it interacts with the earth
[00:03:51] <jotham> from wikipedia Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere).
[00:04:20] <jotham> the sun is on an 11 year cycle of flares
[00:04:22] <CaCode-> I see
[00:04:26] <jotham> and we're building up to the new peak
[00:04:33] <jotham> so it'll get more exciting in the coming months
[00:04:52] <CaCode-> so what is falsely called a wind is more of a golden shower of particles
[00:05:16] <jotham> if you look at a diagram of the heliosphere wind makes more sense
[00:05:20] <CaCode-> these particles in turn disturb the earth's magnetic field
[00:05:26] <jotham> http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/462851main_heliosphere_orig_full.jpg
[00:05:29] <Juliu> CaCode-, I am a scientist, but sadly most scientists are idiots as well
[00:05:35] <jotham> the sun is constantly spewing particles in all directions constantly
[00:05:37] <jotham> like a wind
[00:05:51] <jotham> i will say constantly a few more times, i haven't had a coffee yet
[00:05:58] <Juliu> jotham, wind normally does not go into all directions at the same time
[00:07:03] <CaCode-> this disturbance of the earths magnetic field brings charged particles of course and through this change of course or this acceleration, radiation is emitted that we see as aurora...
[00:08:27] <CaCode-> so does this solar wind ever bring earth itself of course?
[00:09:02] <jotham> it exerts a force on earth, sure
[00:09:07] <CaCode-> if somebody blows against a car long enough it will be pushed away too 
[00:09:32] <CaCode-> since you are a scientist, will earth's rotation come to a halt, if so when?
[00:09:41] <Juliu> CaCode-, earth is leaving its current orbit all the time, just a little bit each year
[00:10:00] <jotham> Juliu is the scientist afaik
[00:10:06] <CaCode-> Juliu will the moon at any time crash into the earth or escape orbit?
[00:10:38] <Juliu> CaCode-, we will very likely get a second natural moon in pretty much exactly 100 years first
[00:11:26] <Juliu> But the second moon will only be 10 to 30 meters in diameter, afaik
[00:11:40] <Juliu> or was it 10 to 30 km? I forgot
[00:12:17] <Bakunin> Him Great Scient.
[00:12:36] <Bakunin> Who fucking invited that bag of dicks here
[00:13:28] <jotham> neat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind#/media/File:52706main_hstorion_lg.jpg
[00:13:38] <jotham> didn't know there was a maybe picture of it
[00:13:57] <Bakunin> yes
[00:14:33] <Juliu> There soon will even be a new movie with Tom Hanks featuring a solar flare turning earth into some kind of post-apocalyptic place, to already brainwash people for the next scam that is coming soon

[23:24:07] <jotham> how can their be spoilers on a 40 year old book
[23:24:09] <ERROH> had a known they pulled a hobbit on it, i would watch the lgbt avengers
[23:24:14] <jotham> jews vs catholics m888
[23:24:23] <ERROH> i've read the book like thrice
[23:24:32] <ERROH> i meant the interpretation spoilers
[23:24:46] <jotham> i think breaking it into more movies is probably the smart move

[23:25:29] <jotham> it's depressing how humans idea of the future is always the same- just fuck loads of brutalist concrete everywhere, all over the universe

[23:26:48] <ERROH> i loved it
[23:27:06] <jotham> yeah i thought it was great
[23:27:12] <jotham> too bad we only got part 1
[23:27:13] <ERROH> but if i knew it was cut, i'd wait for second part and watch it pirated over a weekend
[23:27:24] <jotham> yeah
[23:27:39] <jotham> the ornothopters were pretty nicely done
[23:27:46] <ERROH> oh, should we be furious over the fact that jihad isn't mentioned a single time?
[23:28:17] <ERROH> oh it was nice visually, and i liked the dumbed down introduction at the start
[23:28:29] <jotham> they should just use AI to region lock the right cultural outrage term for the right market using voice synths
[23:28:38] <ERROH> probably was scared ppl wouldn't have any idea wtf was going on like in the sting version
[23:28:46] <jotham> haha
[23:28:56] <jotham> yeah i think the exposition was pretty tasteful

[23:29:08] <jotham> not to tell-not-show
[23:29:34] <jotham> also the witches were done well
[23:30:10] <jotham> but yeah what can you say about a half finished movie
[23:30:20] <jotham> i was wondering how those harvester lifters worked in physics terms
[23:31:10] <ERROH> wait you've gotta point
[23:31:24] <ERROH> isn't exhaust just pushing on the harvester itself?
[23:31:33] <ERROH> that's like in those 4chan magnets memes
