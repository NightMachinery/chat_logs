[17:15:22] <nmeum> hello, I would like to call a foreign lambda from my chicken program which expects a int* to be pased as a function parameter. is it possible to call this foreign lambda directly from scheme code or do I need to create a C wrapper function to handle that function pointer? I tried something along the lines of (let ((my-int 5)) (my-foreign-lambda (object->pointer my-int))) but that doesn't seem 
[17:15:22] <nmeum> to work as intended
[17:24:07] <curium> nmeum: does it work if you do (my-lambda 5) ?
[17:27:53] <curium> (my-foreign-lambda my-int) *
[17:33:10] <nmeum> If I do (my-lambda 5) I get a compilation error "Argument #1 to procedure `my-foreign-lambda' has an invalid type: fixnum. The expected type is: (or pointer locative)"
[17:34:39] <sjamaan> nmeum: You can use (let-location ((my-int integer 5)) (my-foreign-lambda (location my-int)))
[17:35:12] <sjamaan> Alternative, you can use make-locative and pass in that object, but that's a bit more roundabout IMO
[17:36:50] <nmeum> let-location seems to be what I was looking for, thanks a lot!

[22:05:49] <nmeum> is the documentation for eggs in the wiki commonly maintained separately or is there some common inline documentation tool that everyone is using?

[22:18:41] <siiky> nmeum: there are some eggs you can use to write documentation inline and then export to the wiki, but most eggs probably don't use them
