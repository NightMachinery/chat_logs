[18:54:24] <Hawker> ,bef
[18:54:24] <unfinity> Hawker you befriended a duck in 1518.218 seconds! You have made friends with 2 ducks in #datahoarder.
[18:54:42] <Hawker> fastest befriending in the west
[18:56:09] <Hawker> ThePendulum, ngl you're going to get nowhere, parents tend to stick to their guns on stuff they really don't want to do... I'd suggest you try to find a way to make them think that they came up with the idea in the first place, because if they think that they came up with the idea, they're more likely to get a dog... not sure how you'd do that but it's generally how to win at arguments.
[19:00:39] <ThePendulum> so gaslighting my parents?
[19:01:35] <Hawker> lol
[19:01:41] <Hawker> No, but that might work
[19:03:21] <Hawker> I meant for you to make them put the pieces of the puzzle together, sure you can tell them that a dog is good because of x, y, and z but they don't really care. Now if they realize obviously on their own terms that a dog could teach you responsibilities, home defence, other benefits of having a dog, they're more likely to get a dog because they came up with the idea and reasoning behind it
[19:05:02] <ThePendulum> it seems they're mainly affraid a rescue dog is going to have a bunch of problems
[19:05:45] <Hawker> see if you can find studies then
