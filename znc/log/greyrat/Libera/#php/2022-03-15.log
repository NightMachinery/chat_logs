[00:00:30] <Sammitch> da_wunder: I'm pretty sure that that's what they want, but they glossed over the construction of `$key` and just tried to `foreach($foo as $key => $value)` instead
[00:01:06] <__adrian> but seriously, show us the result you expect. e.g., if you have [major:5, amount:10] and [major:5,amount:15]  then you want the result to be [5:25], right?
[00:01:28] <da_wunder> ^

[00:31:26] <Hash> Heh
[00:36:23] <da_wunder> what I have seen with mac + windows users - when ever there is IO stuff going on - docker will be slow - I mean really slow
[00:37:06] <da_wunder> with windows you could  get a bit better performance  by using wsl2 and mounting your application files inside that wsl2 machince
[00:38:16] <da_wunder> but still that isn't the same speed that you get with windows host + wsl2 vs windows host + virtualbox and running those containers inside that vb machine

[00:45:46] <Hash> We need php virtualenv

[00:46:05] <__adrian> no
[00:46:11] <Hash> Man
[00:46:17] <Hash> You're always no to everything.
[00:46:18] <__adrian> we need to kill the idea that applications should live on your desktop os
[00:46:20] <Albright> Hash: Okay, let me whip that up for you - done https://github.com/phpenv/phpenv
[00:46:35] <Albright> I think it only works well for CLI though
[00:46:47] <mlu> Hash: isn't docker sufficient?
[00:47:02] <mlu> that said: I have been guilty of writing an IRC bot in PHP4 back in the days ;)
[00:47:13] <Hash> I did php gtk and qt, it's fine.
[00:47:25] <Albright> Ha, nice.
[00:47:39] * mlu shudders
[00:48:06] <mlu> the nice part is how I first learned PHP in the 90s it's still relevant today :)
[00:48:12] <Albright> For web apps, nothing stopping you from running different versions of PHP-FPM each using different sockets/ports and using web server config to select which one should be used for which URL/site.
[00:48:26] <Albright> Except maybe dirty looks from the container people.
[00:48:31] <Hash> I mostly use php on cli
[00:48:58] <mlu> much rather give dirty looks to the container people for making it much more complicated than necessary
[00:49:11] <Albright> Oh boy, here we go
[00:49:13] <mlu> especially when the contianers themselves have to expose a socket or port
[00:49:19] <da_wunder> and that is why I use docker for my projects - each of then can use different php, different database, mimic the production setup and so on
[00:49:22] <Hash> I don't like docker.
[00:49:29] <Hash> I rarely ever used it.
[00:49:37] <Hash> I have use vagrant in laravel
[00:49:41] <__adrian> yeah, we don't need another "i don't like docker" conversation
[00:49:47] <__adrian> use what you like
[00:49:52] <da_wunder> ^
[00:49:59] <__adrian> just not xampp/etc
[00:50:09] <Hash> I do use what I like
[00:50:13] <__adrian> the important part is "dev env LIKE prod env"
[00:50:18] <Hash> I still publicly say what I don't like.
[00:50:28] <Hash> Both are fine.
[00:50:31] <__adrian> and you're free to, but it's not on topic here
[00:50:37] <mlu> php on CLI is quite nice though: bit more powerful than shell scripting, but it's really simple / quick and dirty
[00:50:46] <Albright> Lul, I've told the story of how my first Drupal project used XAMPP or something like that on the production server right after launching, right?
[00:50:47] <Hash> But why are you making it into an issue
[00:51:02] <Hash> It's a passing statement. If you focus on it and give it the spotlight, then you're being offtopic.
[00:51:10] <Hash> Moving on.
[00:51:29] <__adrian> Albright: lol
[00:51:31] <da_wunder> personally I've use simple `Makefile` on my projects for years - so for dev point of view, you only need to have git and docker and Makefile support on your OS (mostly just linux) - just clone repository and run `make start` command and kaboom - you've running environment in your local machine...
[00:52:00] <mlu> has anyone here used an automated tool to migrate off the legacy mysql extension? are those tools worth it?
[00:52:06] <Hash> I use vagratn instead. Anyoen is free to say what they do or dont' use. That's part of the conversation. If you are worried that some docker hatred will spew, then rest assured it won't.
[00:52:13] <Hash> I would rather not use any
[00:52:33] <mlu> or will you be spending enough time reading through the resutls and fixing stuff anyways that you might as well just refactor it the traditional way?
[00:52:33] <Hash> I would rather have php running directly on my machien, with some kind of abstraction on top for composer and isolation like python's virtualenv.
[00:52:37] <__adrian> mlu: in most cases, automated tools are not possible
[00:53:04] <__adrian> because very few people wrote ext/mysql correctly-enough to make a working port to mysqli
[00:53:12] <mlu> have a legacy project I"m dealing with here where a grep indicates approximately 700 lines of legacy mysql
[00:53:22] <__adrian> that's not a ton
[00:53:32] <da_wunder> Hash: we used vagrant years ago, and those setups did have problems all the way, not sure if there was some major mistake on those or something - but we haven't seen same kind cases with docker setups
[00:53:35] <mlu> yeah -- I'm like: I can do that in a couple days

[00:53:49] <__adrian> but going back to the tool - a tool can't add prepared statements for you
[00:53:55] <Hash> da_wunder: I don't use vagrant or docker for many reasons related to that.
[00:54:18] <mlu> __adrian: I know my initial reaction was: why are there so many mysql_connect() calls in all the places with hardcoded connetion strings?!
[00:54:20] <Hash> I just use php directly on cli, isntalled on OS
[00:54:49] <Sammitch> mlu: sounds like you have more issues than just calls to mysql_]
[00:54:50] <Hash> I have never had the need for containers. They enver made sense to me. They did, but I never saw a point.
[00:55:01] <mlu> Sammitch: godo thing I'm paid to fix them :)
[00:55:05] <Hash> More layers get in the way.
[00:55:14] <__adrian> yeah, people tended to not use $resource
[00:55:16] <Hash> More to debug and tackle through
[00:55:29] <da_wunder> Hash: and personally I have used docker for years - just to make my work easier - I really need to work with project with PHP 5.3 - 8.1 nowadays - so with docker I just need to run that one command `make start` and kaboom that application is running
[00:55:45] <Hash> *nod*
[00:55:51] <mlu> Hash: it's useful in an enterprise (i.e. multiple people) scenario, especially from a documentation standpoint
[00:55:51] <Sammitch> personally I like having a single artifact to deploy anywhere without having to worry about dependencies and/or conflicts
[00:56:02] <da_wunder> Hash: and for debug - each of those docker setups support xdebug
[00:56:23] <Hash> Hey, wanna see how I made my app bette
[00:56:40] <mlu> Sammitch: depending on the stack, a tarball mgiht be good enough
[00:57:01] <Sammitch> mlu: guess what docker images are under the hood?
[00:57:16] <mlu> they're tar :D
[00:57:28] <mlu> but is it a tarball if you don't compress?

[02:13:06] <NakedKing> __adrian, yes it is. I'll add a little more if conditions. Like minor !== 0, and if ['major'] values are equal to each other then get major id and sum ['amount'],  then i will call an event with $majorId, $additiedAmount arguments.
[02:13:43] <NakedKing> i cant use array_filter() function because of the weird array arrangement
[02:13:59] <__adrian> that makes less sense, and implies that my example is NOT what you need.
[02:14:14] <__adrian> look at line 48. is $expected the result you expect or no?
[02:15:02] <__adrian> "...because of the weird array arrangement"  also, forget about this. i dno't know exactly what's confusing you, but there's no "weird array arrangement."
[02:15:17] <funhouse> How do I get the lines of data from shell_exec into an array?
[02:16:11] <__adrian> you might look at exec() instead
[02:16:35] <funhouse> Hmm __adrian it seemed that only gave me 1 line
[02:16:52] <__adrian> ...
[02:16:55] <Albright> funhouse: `$return = shell_exec($cmd); $lines = explode(PHP_EOL, $return);` - be very careful about what, if any, user input you are passing to shell_exec() and friends
[02:17:01] <__adrian> https://php.net/function.exec
[02:17:21] <__adrian> read about $output
[02:17:30] <Albright> Ah, looks like exec() will do a better job in that case
[02:17:43] <funhouse> Ahh ok thank you __adrian
[02:18:36] <__adrian> "be very careful about what, if any, user input"  be careful of anything. YOU can screw things up just as easy as (if not easier than) an attacker can.
[02:18:40] <__adrian> welcome
[02:19:05] <NakedKing> I expected "major" and "amount" .   For example, $addressesFiltered = array_filter($newTransfers, function ($item) {return ($item['subaddr_index']['minor'] !== 0);});    // i cant use this, ERROR: Trying to access array offset on value of type int. But if i move my arrays like this arragement " https://3v4l.org/EDePJ "it will work
[02:20:38] <__adrian> so instead of  [major.minor => $amount], you wanted  [major => $major, amount => $amount]  ?
[02:20:52] <TML> NakedKing: With array_filter(), your filter logic can do literally anything you need it to - but you have to know your data model first
[02:21:03] <__adrian> "Trying to access array offset on value of type int"  read the message. this implies that $item is not an array, but an integer.
[02:21:24] <NakedKing> yes i dont need minor because i will filter it, not want to get minor.0 results. and if there are any duplicated major. i need to sum their amount values
[02:21:34] <__adrian> i'd suspect you're iterating each $transfer, not the _list_ of $transfers.
[02:21:48] <__adrian> much like you kept showing your var_export() output from inside a loop.
[02:22:13] <NakedKing> im using print_r with pre tags for check whats happening
[02:22:19] <__adrian> yeah, don't
[02:22:22] <TML> Stop using print_r
[02:22:25] <__adrian> !+print_r lies
[02:22:25] <php-bot> use var_dump() instead!  print_r() is not helpful (for most purposes; but especially for debugging) as it hides useful information from you.  observe: https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/4b165cd0a1debe39aec6  (or)  https://3v4l.org/ThSLb

[02:25:58] <NakedKing> its my first time with var_dump..
[02:27:25] <__adrian> so you did something like   var_dump($transfer);   inside your loop, yes?
[02:27:31] <__adrian> or $item
[02:28:06] <__adrian> _that_ is what each of those looks like, at that point in your code.
[02:28:22] <NakedKing> yes its in the loop
[02:28:37] <NakedKing> but forget to tell something
[02:28:52] <__adrian> just so we use all the same variable names and understand each other, show us what that loop looks like.

[02:31:43] <NakedKing> I'm trying my best dear __adrian. Please forgive me, I already feel bad please don't make me sad. https://3v4l.org/VKTYK
[02:32:44] <__adrian> i'm not mad at you and i don't need an apology. i want you to slow down and pay attention, go one step at a time, so we can all understand each other. that's all.
[02:33:11] <NakedKing> ok thank you for handling me. I will be more careful
[02:34:19] <__adrian> NakedKing: change it to something like this: https://dpaste.org/q4jz
[02:34:32] <__adrian> don't mess with the array structure, just inspect it so we know what it is.
[02:35:29] <__adrian> actually https://dpaste.org/iZ7d
[02:35:37] <__adrian> let's look at only one iteration for now.
[02:36:40] <__adrian> ugh
[02:36:47] *** Quits: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[02:36:48] <__adrian> scratch that. one moment.
[02:37:54] <NakedKing> https://dpaste.org/b76w 1 iteration
[02:39:11] <__adrian> yeah. good, but that's misleading, because you had an extra  array()  around $transfers that i didn't notice. here: https://dpaste.org/nUy1

[02:41:04] <__adrian> also if you're looking at this in a web browser, copy+paste from "view source", not from the rendered webpage.
[02:43:43] <NakedKing> oh i see the raw part now. okey. why dont you prefer pre tags?
[02:43:53] <__adrian> k, so with formatting: https://dpaste.org/Z2wR
[02:44:27] <__adrian> because it's not html. i want to see the actual output.
[02:45:02] <__adrian> Z2wR is your  $transfers  array: it's a list of arrays that each represents a transfer.
[02:45:49] <__adrian> so if you looped over them here like  foreach ($transfers as $transfer) { ... }   you'd get array [0] the first loop, then array [1], then array [2].
[02:45:54] <__adrian> follow?
[02:46:53] <__adrian> i mean, does that make sense to you?
[02:47:03] <NakedKing> So, i am going to do a new foreach now. What was my mistake, using print_r? why i got confused i dont now.
[02:47:42] <__adrian> no. we're talking about what $transfers looks like. do not write more code right now.
[02:48:31] <__adrian> i want to know if the structure makes sense to you, and if you understand that it's an _array_ that contains _other arrays_.
[02:49:03] <NakedKing> yes dear __adrian its clear
[02:49:26] <NakedKing> but $transfers doesnt have 1 array
[02:50:11] <__adrian> so look at these arrays, and let's decide on what result you want.  [0] is version 0.8 with an amount of 1500000000000.  [1] is 0.0 and 99932410000. [2] is 0.0 and 100000000000.
[02:50:14] <__adrian> yes?

[02:51:30] <__adrian> "NakedKing> but $transfers doesnt have 1 array"  correct. it has three.
[02:51:46] <__adrian> $transfers is *one* array that contains *three arrays*.
[02:52:33] *** Joins: Urawa (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru)
[02:52:38] <NakedKing> First i want to disqualify if ["minor"] == 0.  Dear __adrian, pls forgive me if im wrong but we just did 1 iteration. There are more arrays in $transfers
[02:52:51] *** Quits: Awaru (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:52:52] <NakedKing> we looked just 1 of them
[02:53:02] <__adrian> we're not talking baout the rules yet, only $transfers
[02:53:11] <__adrian> yes, we only did one iteration of your loop.
[02:53:36] <__adrian> the one iteration gave us an array $trnasfers. that one array holds three items. each item is another array.
[02:54:05] <__adrian> it's like   [ [], [], [] ]
[02:54:21] <__adrian> do you understand that one array can have another array inside it?
[02:54:29] <NakedKing> yes ofcourse
[02:54:53] <__adrian> that's exactly what's going on here. this one has three arrays inside it.
[02:55:21] <NakedKing> just 1 thing.

[02:55:57] <NakedKing> the big picture of $transfers is = [ [ [], [], [] ]  ,  [ [], [], [] ]  ,  [ [], [], [] ]   ] something like this, am i correct
[02:56:52] <__adrian> no. we've seen that each time you do  $monero->listIncomingTransfers(...)["transfers"], that's ONE array that contains some number of other arrays.
[02:57:00] <__adrian> it's only like  [ [], [], [] ].
[02:57:12] <__adrian> not like [ [], [], [] ], [ [], [], [] ], [ [], [], [] ]
[02:57:40] <__adrian> i'll brb, dinner. look at your var_dump() result and study the structure.
[02:57:55] <NakedKing> allright __adrian , bon appetit.
[03:09:45] <funhouse> hmm __adrian, so Im using this command  exec("head $csv_path -n 2", $output); i am using it in a loop, it looks like the $output var is not being overwritten, do you know why?

[03:14:37] <sumthing1980> hi is there a way of detecting if js is running in the browser from inside php?
[03:15:04] <NakedKing> This is the all iteration with $transfers: https://dpaste.org/3NGh    There are much more array ['the part i cant understand'].   And var_dump triggers an error after dumping data:  "Undefined array key "transfers"    !empty or !isset checking does not prevent the error.
[03:15:32] <Albright> sumthing1980: You could write a JS script which does an AJAX call to a URL which is not normally accessible via a link
[03:15:49] <sumthing1980> ok
[03:15:51] <Albright> Not totally foolproof but might be good enough.
[03:16:18] <__adrian> sumthing1980: the way you asked it, no. that's not possible. what Albright is describing is writinng js that _tells_ php that it's running.
[03:16:39] <sumthing1980> ok
[03:16:41] <__adrian> php doesn't exist in the web browser, nor at the same time as the webpage.
[03:17:09] <sumthing1980> ok
[03:17:25] <__adrian> NakedKing: (a) your  $monero->listIncomingTransfers(...)["transfers"]  is in a loop. of course you see multiple results.
[03:18:23] <__adrian> NakedKing: (b) "Undefined array key "transfers""  this means that, on some iterations, $monero->listIncomingTransfers(...) does not return an array with the key "trnasfers". you should read the docs for this $monero library to find out what values might be returned from that method.
[03:19:31] <__adrian> (c) "!empty or !isset checking does not prevent the error"  it would, if you put it in the right place. e.g., $list = $monero->listIncomingTransfers(...); if (! isset($list["transfers"])) { continue; } $transfers = $list["transfers"]; ...
[03:20:19] <__adrian> you should only do  ->listIncomingTransfers(...)["transfers"]  if you know the return value will ALWAYS be an array with a "transfers" key.
[03:20:42] <__adrian> (and by "know" i mean there's no possible way it wouldn't... which is obviously not the case here.)
[03:21:53] <NakedKing> ok captain __adrian . i will work on my foreach more. i hope be here next time with good news
[03:22:14] <Blondie101010> it would be VERY advisable to do proper unit tests BEFORE running actual payment data
[03:24:02] <Blondie101010> how would you otherwise test and troubleshoot less common cases?  you can't

[10:29:58] <Naktibalda> sqlite?
[10:30:12] <up_running> improved sql
[10:30:42] <up_running> I did finally get the code working though
[10:30:49] <up_running> but there's a problem
[10:30:58] <up_running> here's the link from yesterday:
[10:30:59] <up_running> https://gist.github.com/random-jaylen/6854a27a6e0bf367752f99c3c22e0db8?permalink_comment_id=4096205#file-sampleb-php-L43
[10:31:36] <Naktibalda> do you avoid saying mysqli ?
[10:31:37] <up_running> so, there is a problem when inserting into a column a value that is null
[10:32:03] <up_running> Naktibalda: oh, right. I meant to type mysqli. sorry about that
[10:32:27] <Naktibalda> missed "my" twice
[10:32:46] <up_running> are you referring to the code?
[10:33:04] <Naktibalda> no, to the first 2 lines you wrote here
[10:33:09] <up_running> ah ok
[10:33:34] <up_running> the code won't work if the field is null, but it will if there is a number there
[10:33:43] <up_running> is there a way to remedy this?
[10:34:18] <Naktibalda> use prepared statements
[10:34:40] <up_running> at the internship site, I proposed just making the value 0, but someone said that they are reluctant to do so since they aren't sure if 0 is different from null
[10:35:38] <up_running> by prepared statements, are you referring to pdos?
[10:35:49] <Naktibalda> !+mysqli_prepare
[10:35:49] <php-bot> mixed mysqli_prepare(object link, string query)  - Prepare a SQL statement for execution - http://php.net/mysqli_prepare
[10:36:25] <up_running> yes, so PDOs
[10:36:40] <Naktibalda> what?!
[10:36:50] <Naktibalda> pdos is not a word
[10:37:29] <up_running> PHP Data Objects then.
[10:37:37] <up_running> But I want to learn this and will eventually, but for now, I'm limited to MySQLi.
[10:37:54] <Naktibalda> I gave you a link to mysqli_prepare and you say that it is about PDO
[10:38:02] <Naktibalda> are you using PHP 5.0?
[10:38:43] <up_running> ah, misunderstood you. i'm reading the link now.
[10:39:29] <up_running> i'm using PHP 8.1.0
[10:39:48] <up_running> well, at home, at least. I'm sure at work
[10:40:44] <Naktibalda> "limited to mysqli" makes no sense since PHP 5.1.0
[10:41:26] <up_running> I was told to stick to mysqli for my task
[10:41:37] <up_running> but, of course, i can learn as much as I want just for me
[10:42:09] <netstar> I imagine they are used to using mysqli and don't want to deviate from their familiarity.
[10:42:21] <netstar> else the intern will have hiddenm knowledge

[10:42:49] <up_running> netstar: exactly. when we discussed this, I was told that I have to keep in mind maintenance
[10:43:09] <up_running> i may learn it, but others will not and it will take time for them to learn it
[10:43:13] <up_running> not worth it for them
[10:43:28] <netstar> tbh it's not that different
[10:43:32] <Naktibalda> they had 15 years, leave as soon as you can
[10:43:56] <up_running> i'm still going to learn it since I want to know as much as possible
[10:44:11] <up_running> but for now, let me see if I can come up with a fix for this problem
[10:44:53] <up_running> I wish __adrian was around and I could ask him about his recommendation to use Spout instead of PHPSpreadsheet
[10:45:19] <up_running> I took a look at the documentation and it doesn't seem to be well-documented
[10:45:24] <up_running> or beginner friendly
[10:45:51] <netstar> I used PHP spreadsheet before...i found it ok. It soon ran out of memory though

[10:57:07] <up_running> Naktibalda: i'm reading this, but are you suggesting using mysqli with a prepared statement?
[11:00:24] <Naktibalda> yes
[11:00:57] <Naktibalda> prepared statements have no issues with values containing '
[11:01:09] <Naktibalda> anyway, what error did you get when you tried to save null?
[11:02:13] <up_running> it's a type int error, but I don't have it front of me currently since I'm at home
[11:02:17] <up_running> But the error is generated even when the code runs successfully
[11:02:36] <up_running> I can copy paste the error tomorrow though if needed
[11:03:47] <Naktibalda> well, the problem with your current code is that you have quotes around all values, so when you try to insert null, you actually attempt to insert empty string
[11:04:03] <up_running> yes, I've fixed that particular issue

[13:53:49] <DevAntoine> Hello
[13:54:07] <DevAntoine> How would you proceed with composer's dependencies when upgrading PHP?
[13:54:19] <DevAntoine> Would you first upgrade PHP then run "composer update"?
[13:55:44] <AllenJB> Ultimately yes, otherwise you may get versions of dependencies not designed to (optimally) run on the new version
[13:56:49] <AllenJB> Altho if the project hasn't been updated in a while, I might be inclined to update dependencies to the latest version for the old version of PHP first, make sure everything is working, then upgrade PHP and update dependencies.

[17:38:57] <Dr-007> anyone knows of a php library / function that will parse a python file and give me an array of classes / functions?
[17:39:43] <Naktibalda> no
[17:40:00] <__adrian> seems like something that would be much more readily available (and reliable) in python
[17:42:05] <Dr-007> yeah, maybe i should just flip it around
[17:42:37] <Naktibalda> what do you actually want to do?
[17:44:42] <Dr-007> ive got python that listens via voice recognition to what i say. the functions are custom and change alot since im a noob. ive got a web backend to manage the words / phrases it listens to
[17:45:03] <Dr-007> the web backend needs to know the functions / classes available to i can attach the words
[17:45:19] <Dr-007> so i figured i parse the python to get the classes and functions
[17:45:41] <Dr-007> but its probably better to let python add the functions to the database

[18:04:19] <__adrian> rule of thumb: classes should very rarely/never have static methods. you need an extremely good reason for it.
[18:04:46] *** Joins: hh (~g@37.214.24.217)
[18:05:13] <__adrian> methods on a class should all be related (have a similar purpose/responsibility). a good way to think about this is that they'd mostly operate on the same set of data (properties).
[18:10:10] <olle> Static methods can't be mocked
[18:11:03] <olle> One exception is possibly the factory method Foo::make($options);
[18:11:16] <__adrian> while true and inconvenient during testing, that's not a design concern in and of itself.

[18:13:02] <olle> Well. You know testability is like nr 1 or 2 of my concerns, personally.
[18:13:04] <olle> But sure.
[18:13:05] <__adrian> a static method ought to be self-containned and carry little/no state, and use DI like any other function, so ideally there's be no need for mocking it in the first place.
[18:13:21] <__adrian> "can mock" ≠ testability
[18:13:23] <olle> __adrian: That's just a normal function, then.
[18:13:43] <__adrian> it is indeed very much like a "normal function"
[18:14:18] <olle> Which is fine when it's pure.
[18:14:28] <__adrian> bbl
[18:14:38] <olle> One could argue the other direction too: If a method has no `$this`, why is it in a class at all?

[18:42:40] <AllenJB> If I understand your question correctly: If it uses a database, just query that. The only case I can think of where you might need to keep a manually updated count is with a flat-file based system / static site generator.

[21:54:15] <__adrian> how does that equate to "arbitrary properties"? domain objects don't have arbitrary properties. database tables _certainly_ dont.
[21:54:52] <goddard> i don't like boiler plate for the sake of boiler plate but if you have a good example i will gladly read something you provide
[21:55:31] <__adrian> ...so you just don't want to write a class for each domain object/db table?
[21:56:01] <__adrian> that's not "boiler plate for the sake of boiler plate." it's not boiler plate at all - it's specific to each domain object.
[21:56:13] <__adrian> literally the opposite of boilerplate
[21:56:22] <goddard> yes and the array provides that structure

[22:00:36] <__adrian> but it sounds like you're thinking you have to do both...?
[22:01:15] <goddard> i have the property map but i then can add those values to the object dynamically then when i do any saving i take the properties from the object that match the fields and can do any type casting on them
[22:01:29] <__adrian> :/
[22:01:40] <__adrian> there are many drawbacks there, and no advantages
[22:01:46] <goddard> so you can access the values easily is the main benefit

[22:02:41] <goddard> less code
[22:02:52] <__adrian> that's not a benefit
[22:02:58] <__adrian> less code, but works worse.
[22:03:03] <goddard> then you can use __get and assign special functions if you need to make modifications to the data for whatever reason when accessing
[22:03:30] <__adrian> that's worse and also inconsistent - harder to write code with
[22:03:46] <goddard> well this is pretty much the exact way Eloquent is written
[22:04:05] <__adrian> ...i really don't think that's true, but i don't have eloquent in front of me
[22:04:41] <__adrian> i think you may be confusing the design/interface with how it's actually coded
[22:04:42] <goddard> i am sure it has a lot more abstraction but i am only one man and those abstractions can be added over time
[22:05:33] <__adrian> if you want the feature ("property-style access") then do it right now, not do it poorly now and then fix it later
[22:05:37] <__adrian> later never happens
[22:06:12] <__adrian> (a) store values in an array property (probably different than the "map" property)
[22:06:31] <__adrian> (b) use a method like ->get($name) for access
[22:06:54] <__adrian> (c) implement a __get() method (that calls ->get()) that people can use if they want to write code that way
[22:07:07] <__adrian> similar approach for setters.
[22:07:42] <goddard> getters and setters can be created when using the magic methods
[22:08:14] <__adrian> ...?
[22:08:21] <__adrian> just make get() and set() upfront.
[22:08:53] <__adrian> this allows you to have a single implementation. you _don't want_ ->get($name) and ->$name to have different behavior/results.
[22:08:53] <goddard> they can get and set by just changing the object value like $object->value = "blah";

[22:09:16] <__adrian> that's part (c) i described above.
[22:09:34] <__adrian> i don't know what you meant by "getters and setters can be created when using the magic methods"
[22:09:56] <__adrian> sounds like "created dynamically" which no, that's a bad idea
[22:09:57] <goddard> the magic method can look over the class to see if you have a special getter or setter for a specific property
[22:10:04] <__adrian> that's a bad idea
[22:10:11] <goddard> works great
[22:10:39] <__adrian> no, it doesn't. it makes things very unclear. it only works when you remember every last detail of how it's implemented, and remember to set things up properly.
[22:10:39] <goddard> your parent class defines the structure of magic getters and setters
[22:10:45] <goddard> then you only create them if you need them
[22:10:46] <__adrian> it's like a stack of dominoes.
[22:10:55] <goddard> nah just gotta understand how to use it
[22:11:18] <goddard> its just a helpful way to design things and avoids boiler plate getter and setters
[22:11:58] <__adrian> you can do what you want, but if you're looking for advice, this is objectively a poor/fragile/inflexible design.
[22:12:32] <goddard> you can make a class implementation with a few properties that has great flexibility and is not fragile at all
[22:13:05] <__adrian> if you have to do things a certain way to make it work, then it's not flexible or robust.
[22:13:31] <__adrian> it can't change because literally everything relies on it being done the way it's done
[22:14:16] <__adrian> and therefore, on the developer remembering exactly how it's done. and to do every step. and it eventually leads to one-off "workarounds."
[22:14:37] <goddard> i think you should try Eloquent man
[22:14:47] <goddard> i love that design
[22:15:09] <__adrian> like i said, i suspect that you love that api.
[22:15:35] <__adrian> which is fine. but look at how it's implemented. i seriously doubt it's implemented the way you expect.
