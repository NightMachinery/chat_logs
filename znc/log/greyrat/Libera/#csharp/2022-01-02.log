[19:58:11] <Nasp> So since it seems like we are looking into another year of with working from home, have any of your workplace made rules regarding work hours and such?
[19:58:33] <Nasp> Germany have had rules regarding it for a while and i just saw Portugal made something similar and i  feel like it's missing
[20:04:43] <MichaelLong> Nasp, we have? you mean there's a law that basically sais you have to allow working from home if your job allows that. as you can imagine it is a bit vague. but it is not really a hot topic.
[20:05:00] <Nasp> No more like working hours and when you may contact collegues
[20:05:17] <Nasp> These working from home seems to wash it all out and people find it fine to contact you late afternoon or evening
[20:05:26] <MichaelLong> ah I see. hmm
[20:07:05] <MichaelLong> I must have missed that, some big companies like VW did it since a while on a voluntary basis, I would have guessed the french are on the forefront on such topics
[20:08:01] <biberu> Nasp: don't know if there's any discussion about that around here, but my experience has just been that we assume office hours and don't bother people before or after those
[20:08:21] <Nasp> Well office hours are washed out
[20:08:31] <Nasp> Some work late and then that's their working hours
[20:09:14] <biberu> 8~17
[20:09:32] <Nasp> So you work 9 hours?
[20:09:46] <biberu> 8 hours with 1 hour break
[20:10:16] <Nasp> Here it's 8 hours with breaks included
[20:10:20] <Nasp> Usually half an hour at noon
[20:10:27] <biberu> nice
[20:10:42] <Nasp> And my issue is when people contact me late afternoon because they are working
[20:10:46] <biberu> anyway, if anyone works outside of those hours they shouldn't count on others being available
[20:10:50] <Nasp> I want to promote better work life balance
[20:10:56] <Nasp> Yeah exactly that's my point
[20:11:45] <MichaelLong> Nasp, isn't that mainly a topic of company culture (of course within boundaries of the law)?
[20:11:49] <Nasp> Yeah
[20:11:53] <Nasp> That's what i was asking for
[20:11:57] <Nasp> I'm not a politician that can make laws
[20:12:05] <Nasp> Like what does your workplace have in that regard
[20:12:09] <Nasp> BEcause we have nothing
[20:12:17] <Nasp> People can contact you in the evening as well when they are working
[20:12:33] <biberu> set some boundaries?
[20:13:20] <MichaelLong> I'm mean we do that quite openly in my company. I was asked to open to emergency calls from employees/general management for the time between christmas and today basically. I was fine because "emergency" was taken quite seriously and nobody called.
[20:13:36] <Nasp> biberu:  That's what i mean do yur workplace have boundaries
[20:14:29] <biberu> sure, we don't bother each other unless there's an emergency, but like MichaelLong is saying it's a cultural thing
[20:14:31] <MichaelLong> other than that, work life balance is highly apprechiated in my company but I guess in general in germany
[20:14:51] <biberu> afaik we haven't even talked about it
[20:16:35] <biberu> Nasp: are you saying no if people bother you with trivial things? are others?
[20:18:02] <MichaelLong> but it can be a difficulty sometimes in normal operation, because we've a quite lax working hour window situation. some people start at 6:00am and the latest starts at 10:30am e.g. but it is mostly well communicated through MS Teams
[20:18:16] <biberu> Nasp: do you have colleagues in different tzs, without families, ...?
[20:19:02] <biberu> yeah, not online in your communication tool -> not at work -> don't bother
[20:19:19] <MichaelLong> but when I talk to friends, the situations can be very very different, e.g. everybody starts at 8:30am etc.
[20:20:08] <MichaelLong> biberu, exatly. and nobody is mad if you close or better "shutdown" your online communication tool
[20:20:52] <Nasp> biberu:  I try to say no
[20:21:06] <Nasp> But i've already been interupted and i think it would be better if we could completely avoid this conflict
[20:21:51] <biberu> the people interrupting you, what's their life situation like? and is their behavior something deeply ingrained in company culture?
[20:21:52] <MichaelLong> interrupted? on which channel?
[20:21:53] <Nasp> biberu:  Everyone is in the same timezone
[20:22:13] <Nasp> MichaelLong: Like people call or contact you on slack
[20:22:24] <Nasp> biberu:  I think it might be a culture thing
[20:22:27] <Nasp> Well ofc it is
[20:22:34] <biberu> don't check slack when you're off duty?
[20:22:41] <Nasp> Kinda hard when it starts beeping
[20:22:44] <Nasp> Throw out my phone?
[20:22:48] <biberu> yes?
[20:22:49] <MichaelLong> ah ok, but then again don't let yourself being interrupted
[20:23:01] <Nasp> Well kinda hard when people fucking call you
[20:23:21] <Nasp> Even though i've set period where im not available and people get a "this person is on do not distuyrb, do yo uwant to disturb them?"
[20:23:22] <MichaelLong> uhm sorry don't get that
[20:24:09] <MichaelLong> just close the application
[20:24:28] <biberu> why do you have your work phone around after hours, especially if it's being abused?
[20:25:15] <Nasp> Its my own phone
[20:25:19] <biberu> it's important for yourself to have clear boundaries between work and free time, don't use the same devices, don't sit in the same place, don't dress the same
[20:25:24] <Nasp> MichaelLong: That require you to unisntall and install the app
[20:25:28] <Nasp> And i use the app personally as well
[20:25:36] <MichaelLong> why do you have company stuff installed on the personal phone?
[20:25:41] <biberu> but that's sort of a separate issue, people shouldn't bother you regardless
[20:25:43] <Seng> I'm pretty sure you can just disable notifications :)
[20:25:56] <Nasp> Seng:  Yes but people get the option to override it for you
[20:26:14] <MichaelLong> what kind of tool was that?
[20:26:18] <Nasp> Slack
[20:26:25] <Seng> Wow. I think it's time to ask for a dedicated company phone in that case.
[20:26:25] <MichaelLong> ah ok, never used that
[20:26:27] <biberu> just exit the app?
[20:26:27] <Nasp> You can set periods you are unavailable or dnd
[20:26:33] <Nasp> biberu:  That requires uninstall
[20:26:37] <Nasp> each day?
[20:26:48] <biberu> you can't kill the process?
[20:26:55] <biberu> you only have a company phone then?
[20:26:59] <Nasp> On android?
[20:27:06] <biberu> why not?
[20:27:07] <Nasp> You do know notification kickstart apps again
[20:27:22] <Nasp> Anyways what's your workplace rules or are there any or have it just never been a problem
[20:27:24] <biberu> i don't, haven't used slack in a long time
[20:27:50] <MichaelLong> nodays there should be some kind of technical "solution" (to a social issue :) ) like those app specific dnd time frames managed through the phones operating system but as biberu said it is not the original solution
[20:27:51] <biberu> afaik we are just nice ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:28:28] <Nasp> MichaelLong:  Yes that's what im implying it could be nice if there were guidelines for "Hey i'm off bitch"
[20:28:45] <MichaelLong> common sense, people are very careful, because they could also be bothered. nobody wants that
[20:28:46] <biberu> i wouldn't even go looking for a technical or regulatory solution on that scale
[20:29:06] <Nasp> Just a normal working hours could solev it
[20:29:11] <Nasp> Outside working hours wait until next day
[20:29:18] <Nasp> Easy for everybody to understand
[20:29:33] <biberu> so have a talk with everyone about it?
[20:29:35] <MichaelLong> then you should bring that up to your superiors probably
[20:30:09] <biberu> maybe there's just a lot of young people with free time and a desire to prove themselves?
[20:30:25] <Nasp> Well he doesnt see it as a problem
[20:30:37] <Nasp> "Just say no"
[20:30:42] <Nasp> And he gets pissed if oyu say no to him
[20:30:55] <Nasp> Why i considered bringing it to higher mangement level
[20:31:07] <biberu> start writing down overtime?
[20:31:15] <MichaelLong> let him get pissed.
[20:31:20] <biberu> find another employer?
[20:31:51] <MichaelLong> not really an issue to switch jobs right away in my opinion
[20:32:16] <Seng> Nasp: what people are saying is basically; take care of yourself - no one else will.
[20:32:30] <biberu> he's probably not amused by the idea of having to recruit replacements either
[20:32:53] <biberu> step 1: find a developer without a job
[20:33:16] <biberu> are there a lot of these where you're at nasp? ^^
[20:33:25] <Nasp> 12 or so
[20:33:31] <Nasp> And we need to hire 10
[20:33:49] <Nasp> CEO wants to promote balance, which was why i considered if others had guidelines in place
[20:34:00] <Nasp> And i could take inspiration from that
[20:34:14] <biberu> i'm just trying to point at possible leverage here
[20:36:16] <MichaelLong> I would just bring it up
[20:40:31] <biberu> you can start just talking with colleagues if you haven't tried already, most people would probably feel the same, you don't have to get someone to formalize rules to bear down on people from above as a first step
[20:48:51] <ern> Nasp: how can people contact you on slack if you are not at work?
[20:49:01] <Nasp> ern:  Send a message or press the call button?
[20:49:14] <ern> Why are you using work equipment when at home?
[20:49:31] <ern> I leave my work shit at work.
[20:49:38] <Nasp> Because i work from home?
[20:49:52] <ern> Well, surely you turn off your work computer when you are finished
[20:49:53] <Nasp> Which is why i asked for some WFH atique
[20:49:55] <Nasp> etiquette
[20:50:01] <Nasp> I still have my phone
[20:50:10] <ern> That's why you have two phones
[20:50:14] <ern> One for work - one for private.
[20:50:17] <Nasp> I only have one phone
[20:50:18] <ern> Worth every penny
[20:50:32] <ern> Teams is so shitty you can't put it to offline.
[20:50:46] <biberu> Nasp: even when you work from home there's a home and an office, you've got to separate those somehow
[20:50:48] <ern> so, basically you get disturbed by auto messages and whatnot.
[20:51:11] <ern> Nasp: do you use the teams / office suite?
[20:51:34] <MichaelLong> ern, I would just log off that app if I really had to. Away or Offline scares poeple away here :>
[20:52:02] <ern> MichaelLong: Log off means you have to do MFA login again, and a 30 char password on the tiny display.
[20:52:27] <ern> And, it will also logout all other tinysoft applications like outlook etc
[20:53:04] <ern> I solved it by having double equipment. One for work, one for private.
[20:53:05] <MichaelLong> but Nasp said I also cannot do it with slack because he's using it to cantact other people. I don't know how slack works but our ms teams is configured to only work for your company contacts
[20:53:13] <biberu> Nasp: i've heard of people who take a walk around the block to get to their (home) office in the morning, and the same go home after work :)
[20:53:22] <Nasp> biberu:  Yes what about that
[20:53:35] <biberu> home != office
[20:53:37] <ern> my walk around the block is about as far as to my office.
[20:53:39] <MichaelLong> ern, yes but I have this stuff in the key chain thingy or how it is called
[20:53:51] <biberu> you said you can't leave your things at work Nasp, but you can
[20:54:08] <ern> You should not use work equipment for private use.
[20:54:16] <ern> Work accounts for private use. Work phon for private us.
[20:54:19] <ern> Then you are golden.
[20:54:41] <ern> When I walked out of my workplace of 12 years, it was a non event.
[20:54:53] <MichaelLong> or only use the work slack on the work computer and not on the phone
[20:54:54] <ern> No need to give new mail / phone to people
[20:55:27] <ern> I guess you can get a private slack account for spare time
[20:56:03] <biberu> ern: my point was rather than you can use these tricks to tell your head whether you're at work or not
[20:56:14] <biberu> it's not about the distance or your physical location
[20:56:44] <ern> biberu: The idea is to not cheapskate and use company equipment after hours.
[20:56:52] <biberu> like mentioned above, don't use the same devices, if possible don't sit in the same place, change hour clothes etc
[20:56:56] <ern> I do opposite, I use RDP to work should i have to work from home.

[20:58:21] <MichaelLong> actually quite alot do that
[20:58:24] <biberu> yes?
[20:58:58] <MichaelLong> most of the collegues that have requested a work phone did just that. and the key is to NOT carry them around all the time
[20:59:06] <biberu> ^
[20:59:07] <ern> Why carry it?
[20:59:12] <ern> It will reside at office.
[20:59:19] <MichaelLong> it is really not that hard
[20:59:20] <ern> Unless on company trip.
[20:59:35] <Nasp> Well if you dont carry them arouind then you could just as well not have a phone at all
[20:59:53] <biberu> yes?
[21:00:18] <biberu> you keep getting the point, but then you miss it anyway ^^
[21:00:31] <MichaelLong> hehe biberu, exactly my thoughts
[21:00:41] <ern> Nasp: Why should you carry a work phone around? You are paid at work. Not at home.
[21:00:44] <Nasp> Why not not have a laptop while we are at it
[21:00:49] <Nasp> ern:  For emergencies
[21:00:54] <MichaelLong> the original issue was: why do you have this slack  on your personal device
[21:00:54] <ern> What emergency?
[21:00:59] <Nasp> Downtime?
[21:01:03] <ern> Are you getting paid to answer on emergencys?

[21:02:16] <ern> Exactly.
[21:02:17] <MichaelLong> so the realy question is, who defines what an "emergency" is, right?

[21:02:29] <ern> I guess you have a minimum 1h charge when called after hours?
[21:02:57] <biberu> MichaelLong: not Nasp's job though, if someone calls when he's on duty he picks up and starts the clock
[21:03:05] <ern> And, that time can't be 24/7, EU work regulations say you must have 11h free each 24h and then some weekend too
[21:03:15] <ern> That's federal law, from your masters in Brussels.
[21:03:26] <biberu> if it wasn't an emergency management pays anyway, and that's incentive to keep emergencies real
[21:04:10] <MichaelLong> but initially the issue was, that collegues "bother" him. now we somehow arrived at emergencies that are paid. somehow strange.
[21:04:19] <biberu> yeah
[21:04:26] <MichaelLong> totally different situations
[21:04:53] <ern> I mean, I have had emergencies at work now during christmas
[21:05:01] <ern> I did not call anyone because, it will not really help.
[21:05:10] <ern> They can take the shitstorm when back on normal rate on monday
[21:05:11] <ern> :P
[21:05:26] <Nasp> biberu:  But im on all for emergency, not for day to day questions
[21:05:45] <ern> Nasp: that's the problem in a "connected world"
[21:05:52] <ern> and using company equipment.
[21:06:22] <MichaelLong> as I said, there needs to be a definition of "emergency" that everyone involved agrees to.
[21:06:44] <MichaelLong> I see your management responsible for that discussion.
[21:07:35] <ern> Indeed, but I think the problem is Nasp is using work chat account for private use.
[21:07:47] <ern> And since he's "green" his collegues bother him.
[21:07:55] <Nasp> Bingo
[21:08:08] <ern> I have co-workers on Telegram, but I only send pictures of cats there.
[21:08:09] <Nasp> Or in general people just misuse it
[21:08:11] <ern> Never ever discuss work.
[21:08:19] <Nasp> Said if i highlighted anyone in here to ask a simple question
[21:08:28] <ern> except force majeure: "I'm stuck in traffic, will miss the meeting"
[21:08:38] <Nasp> Let me see if i can disable notifications all together and see how long before anyone notices
[21:09:22] <biberu> Nasp: are you getting paid for the trivial calls?
[21:09:33] <Nasp> It's part of base on call salary
[21:09:48] <ern> Nasp: But is it 24/7 ?
[21:09:56] <ern> Becuase, that's not in line with EU federal law.
[21:09:57] <biberu> no extra for actual issues handled?
[21:09:57] <Nasp> In theory yes
[21:10:10] <ern> it can be a huge fine for your company
[21:10:35] <ern> if you are "on schedule" (required to pick up phone) that counts against your "free time"
[21:10:53] <Nasp> Not if it's on call
[21:10:58] <Nasp> Also all those EU rules never give fines
[21:11:00] <ern> it is.

[21:12:45] <ern> As an employer, you must ensure that your staff does not work more than 48 hours per week on average (including overtime), over a reference period of up to 4 months. Your employees must be given at least 11 consecutive hours of daily rest and at least 24 hours of uninterrupted weekly rest every 7 days, over a reference period of 2 weeks.
[21:13:03] <ern> 11 hours of rest does not include being "on call"
[21:15:09] <biberu> even assuming they could ignore this, why would you work for them? is it hard to get a job as a developer where you're at?
[21:16:15] <ern> It's kind of mandatory to work according to this.
[21:26:39] <biberu> Nasp: so in summary you have so many ways you might choose to play this, depending on your context, but it shouldn't have to be an issue
[21:27:24] <Nasp> Yeah but it is

[21:29:47] <MatthiasVance> We have 0 expectations of availability
[21:31:03] <MatthiasVance> So yes that might mean you get messages from me at 2am, but I also expect you to set up your notifications so you don't see them :P
[21:31:25] <Nasp> Problem is the software we use, the person sending it can decide to override your notification settings
[21:31:40] <MatthiasVance> Don't be on your work computer outside of work?

[22:11:30] <Nasp> In the end it will yes

[22:14:03] <ern> I send to peoples teams 24/7
[22:14:08] <MatthiasVance> yeah

[22:16:31] <MatthiasVance> Noooo Nasp
[22:16:36] <MatthiasVance> You can send messages *at any time*
[22:16:43] <MatthiasVance> And if people are working, they respond .. wow!
[22:16:55] <ern> Nasp: I write to them when they are first in my queue to be processed. And usually they respond when they come in to office.

[22:17:19] <Nasp> And dont see an issue with it?
[22:17:34] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: I work in a team .. we know what to expect from each other. Maybe you don't?

[22:20:53] <ern> if people wake up from my chat, they are at their own fault :P
[22:22:42] <Nasp> Well if you have the i never expect peopel to be available, then i can see it workiing
[22:22:57] <Nasp> But if you expect people to be available sometimes during the day then the annoy people whenever you want doesnt work
[22:23:05] <Nasp> So you have both, or none
[22:23:10] <Nasp> That way i can see it working
[22:25:04] <MatthiasVance> Yes Nasp exactly
[22:25:18] <Nasp> But most workplaces i know of, have a period where oyu need to be available
[22:25:19] <ern> Well, they want something from me. I give it. They have then to respond to me at their convinience
[22:25:46] <Nasp> But hen like i said we need guidelines, if taht's your guidelines to expect nothing then everybody plays with the same rules
[22:26:56] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: I can work with 2 different people where one expects me to be available between 9-5 and the other doesn't care.. guidelines will not fix that

[23:04:16] <Ameisen> blegh
[23:04:22] <Ameisen> I need to avoid copies
[23:04:29] <moose> Profiling told you that?
[23:04:31] <Ameisen> would make more sense to write a custom MemoryStream :|
[23:04:46] <Ameisen> Yes, and the fact that I already get hitches from data transfers that cause blocking on the UI thread
[23:05:14] <moose> And your hot path was actually a copy or was it something else?
[23:05:16] <Ameisen> this entire system was originally written for .NETfx 4.5, so has a lot of weirdness (it didn't have Span, so I have a custom 'FixedSpan' which I'm slowly removing)
[23:05:24] *** Quits: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:05:36] <Ameisen> the particular operation is a hash, and hashes happen a lot, and mainly on the UI thread for various reasons
[23:05:38] <moose> You could update your API to support the use of Span instead.
[23:05:43] <Ameisen> I'm working on it.
[23:05:51] <Ameisen> Though in this case, it's a third-party library, and I cannot change its inputs
[23:06:01] <Ameisen> though I could generate new ones from IL
[23:06:01] <moose> Which lib?
[23:06:08] <Ameisen> one of the xxhashes
[23:06:15] <Ameisen> I need to write my own at some point
[23:06:17] <moose> Which one? lol
[23:06:34] <Ameisen> Interestingly, it's inheriting from System.Data.HashFunction.IHashFunction, which doesn't take spans
[23:06:51] <Ameisen> System.Data.HashFunction.xxHash
[23:07:05] <Ameisen> it's outdated and I need to run new profiling on newer hash libraries
[23:07:14] <Ameisen> plus, since xxhash3 is out, that will need an implementation
[23:07:54] <moose> I hate it when people extend existing official namespaces like that

[23:08:41] <Ameisen> I do too
[23:08:53] <moose> Why not re-implement the hash?
[23:08:55] <moose> It's pretty simple
[23:09:12] * Ameisen absolutely didn't have his own System.Range and System.Index back with .netfx 4.5 which were completely incompatible with the real ones and required significant refactoring
[23:09:28] <Ameisen> because I have like 90 other things to do right now :P

[23:09:55] <Ameisen> the game this is a mod for switched from XNA on .NETfx 4.5 to MonoGame on .NET 5. This has entailed a _lot_ of changes since my mod is very low level and requires lot latency.
[23:09:56] <moose> Would be easier to re-implement the hash than even discuss this further tbh

[23:10:17] <Ameisen> once I have things functional, I can start tinkering with that
[23:10:21] <Ameisen> I'm using xxhash64 right now
[23:10:25] <Ameisen> but xxhash3 is the newest
[23:11:01] <moose> If you're not hashing at least 2^32 different things in the same domain, you can use XXH32
[23:11:16] <moose> more like 2^24 but yeah
[23:11:36] <moose> With either though you need to account for the possibility of collisions, even if they're unlikely.
[23:11:48] <Ameisen> XXH64 in benchmarks runs faster than XXH32 on 64-bit targets. Significantly so.
[23:12:06] <Ameisen> 64-bit is the only supported target in the new game version
[23:12:20] <Ameisen> plus, I really really really don't want any collisions in the cache since it isn't robust against them
[23:12:32] *** Joins: kilitary (~Username@188.242.187.4)
[23:13:01] <moose> XXH64 is actually not XXH3
[23:13:05] <Ameisen> I know
[23:13:09] <Ameisen> XXH3 didn't exist at the time
[23:13:22] <moose> XXH3 is indeed the fastest thing and yes it's 64-bit.
[23:13:27] <Ameisen> I just spend an hour changing this SpriteInfo class to hashing the entire sheet's data to using a ReadOnlySequence, and then making it so I can hash _that_.
[23:13:42] <Ameisen> since sprites in a spritesheet are non-contiguous.
[23:14:17] <Ameisen> I suspect that doing a copy instead would make more sense at that point, but I need to profile that.
[23:14:35] <Ameisen> Since it's still a non-contiguous copy (though with a constant stride)
[23:16:04] <moose> You said you don't want collisions
[23:16:10] <moose> But you still need to consider that they can happen
[23:16:15] <Ameisen> Yup.
[23:16:18] <moose> No matter what algorithm you use
[23:16:23] <Ameisen> Right now, if a collision happens, a sprite will display as corrupt.

[23:16:48] <moose> This sounds kinda janky
[23:16:49] <moose> lol
[23:16:52] <Ameisen> I have a solution to that, but I haven't ever run into that issue yet.
[23:17:09] <Ameisen> It's a mod that resamples every sprite in the game, including ones added by other mods, on the fly.
[23:17:17] <Ameisen> and it was originally written for .NET 4.5.2
[23:17:21] <Ameisen> on XNA.
[23:17:23] <Ameisen> of course it's janky.
[23:17:25] <moose> what does it do?
[23:17:29] <moose> just resamples and does what?
[23:17:41] <Ameisen> https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4922
[23:18:05] <Ameisen> it resamples all sprites on the fly using xBRZ presently (and chooses the scale factor from 2x to 6x based upon the sprite's drawing conditions
[23:18:07] <Ameisen> )
[23:18:30] <Ameisen> because of the nature of the game and renderer, a lot of logic is tied directly to the rendering thread, and because it's on the fly, I have to limit the time spent there to prevent hitches
[23:19:26] <Ameisen> the hashes are used for a variety of cache lookups for data, to either prevent resampling if it's unnecessary (which happens concurrently but even so, .NET thread priorities aren't quite as useful as native ones, so even at lowest they still take CPU time from the game) or preventing unnecessary GetData calls.
[23:19:44] <Ameisen> I have a TODO for OpenGL to use PBOs to make reads/writes to textures asynchronous.
[23:19:55] <moose> Neat
[23:20:06] <Ameisen> additionally, the game was originally 32-bit, so we had a very limited address space, and we burst it a lot.
[23:20:27] <Ameisen> So the code minimizes allocations, the file cache is compressed, and the in-memory cache was also zSTD compressed, but I removed that part.
[23:20:34] <Ameisen> on 64-bit that just added needless complexity.
[23:21:29] <Ameisen> with lots of modpacks, even without this mod people were getting out of memory errors. With it? It has the potential to triple or more address space usage, so it made it worse in some cases (better in others because it enforced specific GC points, compressed textures, and added patches to detect when assets weren't disposed properly)
[23:21:59] *** Joins: kilitary (~Username@188.242.187.4)
[23:22:20] <Ameisen> I want to get rid of FixedSpan (which I'm working on) because it's janky as heck. No Span at the time, so it basically... is a Disposable wrapper around a GC pinning handle and a pinned array (and the pinned pointer). Casts stupidly easy, of course.
[23:22:34] <Ameisen> but it has to be disposed, otherwise the finalizer cleans it up but that's non-deterministic.

[23:23:10] <Ameisen> I've been switching more to Span and GC.AllocateUnitializedArray (with pinned set to true when necessary)
[23:23:53] <Ameisen> and experimenting with SIMD in C#, though to my dismay, Numerics.Vector has no bitshifting operations.

[23:26:21] <Ameisen> but yeah, it's been a long fight of seeing how much logic I can move away from the UI thread
[23:26:25] <Ameisen> and the latest game update made that harder
[23:26:45] <Ameisen> Windows builds now use OpenGL instead of D3D9. D3D9 allowed creation/loading from a separate thread. OpenGL just crashes.
[23:27:23] <Ameisen> which reminds me that I need to try forcing the game's UI thread to have specific thread affinity, and having my worker threads tied to different cores.
