[00:58:15] <johnjay> ^
[00:58:24] <johnjay> although maybe that's when the www started
[00:58:28] <johnjay> depends on the term you define
[00:58:49] <rpav> web is definitely pre-90s
[00:58:57] <johnjay> yes if you define darpanet as the web
[00:58:59] <johnjay> or BBSs
[00:59:10] <rpav> internet is arguably the standardization of TCP/IP, but very obviously evolved from earlier networks
[00:59:58] <rpav> wikipedia claims 1974?
[01:00:16] <johnjay> is that when darpanet started?
[01:00:29] <bpalmer> johnjay: the term Internet was used starting in the 1970s (Internet Working Group, Internet Configuration Control Board; the Internet Activities Board was from 1983, etc)
[01:00:29] <rpav> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol

[01:01:58] <rpav> definitely (not that i was around to know)
[01:02:13] <johnjay> that's why doc brown went to 1885. when the real net was founded
[01:02:17] <bpalmer> As by 1961 you had the Compatible Time-Sharing system where people could dial in to a computer
[01:02:23] <rpav> but "Internet Protocol" being established in 74 seems as reasonable a place as any to point to as "the internet began"
[01:02:43] <johnjay> then what do you call the big spinning e in 1994?
[01:02:49] <rpav> a mistake
[01:03:02] <johnjay> hah

[01:38:47] <acdw> i've used ivy a little, never helm tho
[01:39:19] <acdw> but both basically re-implement stuff Emacs already has, meaning that you'll need to install compatibility layers in other packages if you want them to work with those 
[01:39:29] <aidalgol> I have tried both, very briefly, and did not like either.

[01:39:59] <acdw> so you won't have to re-work the wheel basically

[02:31:51] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: you define keys in icomplete-minibuffer-map

[02:33:00] <Spawns_Carpeting> thanks guys. im really glad that person told me about icomplete-vertical, it works pretty well
[02:34:25] <Spawns_Carpeting> whats the symbol for space?
[02:34:39] <pjb> SPC
[02:34:49] <pjb> (kbd "SPC") --> " "
[02:37:58] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: if you're looking for an argument to use with kbd, C-h k and then hit the key you want to use.
[02:38:31] <Spawns_Carpeting> the map variable uses some weird ?\C-j, syntax thing
[02:38:35] <bpalmer> you'll see something like "SPC runs the command"  <-- just copy whatever is there before "runs the command" and put it inside a strign argument to kbd
[02:38:53] <Spawns_Carpeting> it doesn't use kbd at all
[02:39:01] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: there are many notations acceptable for key bindings, but kbd has hte advantage of letting you copy and paste the descriptions that emacs itself uses.
[02:40:20] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: the current code may not use it, but kbd will almost certainly work (but do pay attention to quoting issues)

[02:40:30] <wickedjargon> I guys, I have a question about evil-mode.
[02:42:06] <wickedjargon> I use evil-mode. I would like to bind "<f9> r" to do a regex search. That is, hitting "<f9> r" makes `:%s//g` appear in the mode line with the cursor `:%s/<here>/g`
[02:42:22] <Spawns_Carpeting> so can I replace [?\C-j] with (kbd "<C-j>") for example
[02:43:26] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: yes, almost certainly.
[02:43:26] <wickedjargon> this would be `	nnoremap <f9>r :%s//g<Left><Left>` in a .vimrc.
[02:43:34] <Spawns_Carpeting> thanks bpalmer 
[02:43:57] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: actually, (kbd "C-j") is the better way to do it. Again, just C-h k and type the key you want to use, then copy and paste from th e description

[02:45:21] <Spawns_Carpeting> Do the <> isn't needed?
[02:45:27] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: kbd is a function that returns an internal key representation. Thus, it hides the gory details from you.

[02:45:56] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: some of those internal representations and legacy ways of describing keys also work.
[02:46:35] <bpalmer> sometimes the <> are required, but kbd and using emacs's own description lets you get away with not fussing about the details.

[06:01:26] <fsbot`> We can help you with your problem better if your error description is more informative than "it doesn't work"
[06:01:44] <bpalmer> what does happen?
[06:03:01] <wickedjargon> "%s///g" is indeed entered in my evil minibuffer 
[06:03:06] <bpalmer> wickedjargon: (I am guessing, however, that you will be better off in this case using a keyboard macro)
[06:03:34] <wickedjargon> but it doesn't go back 3 chars, the cursor is at the for right as if the (left-char 3) function call was not made
[06:04:19] <bpalmer> OK. It sounds like it hasn't been made *yet*, because (evil-ex ...) hasn't returned (and won't until after you enter data)
[06:04:51] <bpalmer> a keyboard macro lets you work around that because you'll be entering key sequences so can mess with the input minibuffer
[06:05:39] <dale> Good point, could be sitting in read-from-minibuffer or the like.
[06:05:54] <wickedjargon> bpalmer, I've only ever used define keyboard macros for immediate use. Is there a way to save a keyboard macro and execute it in code?
[06:06:01] <bpalmer> record a macro using C-x (   do whatever you want, then C-x )  , then M-x name-last-kbd-macro RET to give a name, and then M-x insert-kbd-macro RET in *scratch*  and give the macro a function like definition
[06:06:22] <bpalmer> you can then copy that definition into your init files, and bind the name to a key (just like a function of that name) and so on.
[06:06:46] <wickedjargon> wonderful. thanks :). I'll do that now

[10:22:23] <aidalgol> codingquark: Why on earth would you need a language server for Emacs?  Emacs is already an elisp environment.  Emacs have *more* capabilities for manipulating and navigating elisp than LSP.
[10:22:31] <aidalgol> er, dre, same question.
[10:22:36] <aidalgol> codingquark: Ignore that! :P
[10:22:50] <codingquark> I was about to type for 30min!
[10:23:16] <dre> aidalgol, because we have jobs that don't run on elisp(tm) architecture

[10:23:49] <dre> by that i mean python

[10:23:59] <dre> no i wanted it for python

[10:24:15] <dre> i code python btw
[10:24:35] <dre> nah that's alright, common mistake
[10:24:37] <aidalgol> I haven't used LSP for Python, but I use it for Elixir and C++ with eglot.
[10:24:58] <parsnip> aidalgol: did you bounce between eglot and lsp-mode at all?
[10:25:35] <aidalgol> parsnip: I started with lsp-mode, then later switched to eglot when Debian backports offered a new enough version of Emacs to run it.
[10:25:40] <aidalgol> I overall prefer eglot.
[10:27:35] <parsnip> i think i started with eglot, wanted to like it, liked the idea that it was more minimalist, but then i probably just wanted to try something easier for dart.
[10:28:04] <parsnip> i use it almost exclusively for jump to definition

I don't need evil-commentary in dired anyway, so I thought I could disable it with a hook, that gave me the dired binding back, the problem is that the hook also disables it in other buffers. Is it possible to disable it in dired buffers only? Or alternatively get the dired binding to override the evil-commentary one when in dired buffers?

[23:10:21] <dale> lisp123: If you mean to make pressing the meta key on its own do something, no, Emacs doesn't really support that.  You may be able to use tools outside of Emacs to translate a press of meta into another keystroke Emacs can bind.

[23:22:24] <acdw> https://ttm.sh/eQB.txt johnjay
[23:22:25] <kenran> If you're using ~/.emacs instead of the folder with init.el inside, you could also just symlink the .emacs file in the repo's directory to ~/.emacs

[23:23:42] <Osugi> johnjay: not sure. it looks like i last updated emacs about a month ago (on Gentoo). GNU Emacs 27.2 (X toolkit, cairo version 1.16.0). but also melpa packages more recently. after problem started, i removed some packages i didn't use - one was emms extention that added japanese radio stations. but that was after the issues started.
[23:24:08] <lisp123> kenran: Ah, the other way round right? ~/.emacs links to the repo
[23:24:12] <kenran> lisp123: I'm not sure I understand the direction :) If you want a repo with just your emacs configuration, create that in some directory, then delete your original ~/.emacs file, and then create the symlink into your home. This way, your init file "is" the symlink
[23:24:18] <kenran> lisp123: yes exactly

[23:39:16] <johnjay> honestly i have no idea lol emms is so overly engineered it looks like
[23:39:34] <johnjay> you could try deleting the first entry from that list
[23:39:46] <johnjay> or the mplayer ones. then it might try the right player

[23:40:40] <Osugi> i tried playing a song. no errors. it finished in like 3 seconds. just said "no next track in playlist.
[23:40:47] <johnjay> what command do you do
[23:40:54] <Osugi> emms-play-file
[23:41:10] <bremner> for me sins, I'm trying to get a minimal configuration of gnus working. I have set gnus-select-method to (nnmaildir "mail" (directory "~/Maildir")), but it complains about existing message files when I try to start gnus. 
[23:41:20] <Osugi> normally, it would be emms-play-playlist. goes through it very fast.
[23:41:26] <johnjay> by the way it just tries things in your path
[23:41:35] <johnjay> so if mpv,vlc, etc are in it that should be fine

[23:43:38] <bremner> Oh, c'mon gnus, you just mangled 10G of email.

[23:44:16] <aindilis> okay good
[23:44:29] <aindilis> that's what I'm learning (years later than I should)
[23:44:48] <johnjay> Osugi: well there's one more thing we can do
[23:44:53] <johnjay> try turn on debug mode
[23:45:11] <johnjay> well. maybe it's not crashing 
[23:45:13] <johnjay> so that won't do anything
[23:45:33] <Osugi> how do i turn on debug mode?

[23:46:01] *** Quits: antlers (~antlers@162.216.47.45) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:46:02] <johnjay> but i think it's not erroring out. it's just silently failing to find tracks somehow
[23:46:34] <johnjay> you can do M-x emms-play-file right?
[23:46:36] <johnjay> like interactively?
[23:46:44] <Osugi> failing to find tracks, or there is an issue with pulseaudio
[23:46:57] <Osugi> yes, emms-play-file works. 
[23:47:14] <Osugi> all my usual interactions with emms work. 
[23:47:46] <Osugi> just no sound, and it flies through the songs. 
[23:47:53] <johnjay> there is a function emms-track it calls
[23:48:00] <johnjay> so maybe it's failing ot add it to the playlist
[23:48:30] <johnjay> anyway sorry i couldn't help you
[23:48:33] *** Quits: spithash (~spithash@user/spithash) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[23:48:36] <johnjay> i didn't realize emms is so huge
[23:48:46] <Osugi> when i call emms-play-playlist, it opens the playlist and i can switch to the *Music* buffer. 
[23:49:22] <johnjay> and you can play from there or no?
[23:50:12] <kenran> bremner: what did gnus do there?
[23:50:25] *** Joins: spithash (~spithash@user/spithash)
[23:50:49] <bremner> kenran: I don't really know. For some reason it wants rename files. I just want a read-only view. Can I point gnus at a message to view?
[23:51:12] <Osugi> johnjay: it "plays" but only in the broken sense. it gets through half the playlist before i can even switch to the buffer. but, i can start, stop, etc. emms from there.
[23:51:13] <johnjay> Osugi: oh i missed you upgraded 26 to 27
[23:51:18] <johnjay> yes that could have been the reason
[23:51:24] <johnjay> i think a bunchof things did change to 27
[23:51:46] <Osugi> not sure if that was the change or not. was 26 still common a month ago?
[23:52:00] <johnjay> every distro i've used like fedora or debian had 27
[23:52:11] <Osugi> with gentoo, it could have been 27.1 to 27.2
[23:52:13] <johnjay> i remember there was some change in package syntax for example
[23:52:42] <johnjay> i mean it coudl also be a bug in emms
[23:53:19] <kenran> bremner: no idea, sorry - when I was trying/using it, I used nnimap exclusively. I was just hoping to not have the same happen to me if you knew what it did.
[23:53:24] <Osugi> okay. but, also, it was working until a reboot a few days ago.
[23:53:37] <Osugi> certainly hasn't been broken for a month.
[23:54:07] <Osugi> (yeah, i just put 2 and 2 together on that)
[23:54:13] <johnjay> wait you rebooted and that triggered it?
[23:54:19] <Osugi> i think so.
[23:54:28] <Osugi> only time i stop emacs, usually.
[23:54:33] *** Joins: antlers (~antlers@162.216.47.45)
[23:54:33] <johnjay> probably then there was something you did in emacs you lost.
[23:54:36] <dale> Osugi: How did you start Emacs?
[23:54:39] <johnjay> yeah exactly. you probably leave emacs running all the time right
[23:54:47] <johnjay> so you probably forgot whatever fix was needed to get it to work
[23:54:58] <Osugi> emac --daemon
[23:55:00] <johnjay> i do that all the time
[23:55:03] <dale> Osugi: I'm wondering if it is failing to inherit some environment variable(s).
[23:55:18] <dale> Osugi: Is that started from e.g. systemd or did you start it manually from a terminal where a media player is working?
[23:55:35] <johnjay> good point dale i was assuming the latter
[23:55:57] <Osugi> johnjay: yeah, i have done that before, too. but I haven't had to tweak emms since setting it up originally. (at least not directly)
[23:56:20] <Osugi> it starts from a script i run manually after logging in. gentoo, fluxbox, no systemd
[23:56:21] <johnjay> Osugi: if you try starting emacs in a terminal like dale suggests does it change?
[23:56:38] <Osugi> let me try that ....
[23:56:50] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[23:57:57] <Osugi> johnjay: nope, same issue. (but daemon is still running, if that matters. i started emacs, not emacsclient)
[23:58:04] <dale> I don't use emms but you might look for some buffers that start with a space (and are therefore often not offered as completions for buffer switching or in the buffer list) that have to do with emms.  Packages will often use a buffer named such as " *foo*" (note leading space) for Emacs package foo to communicate with an external program.  You *may* find useful diagnostic information in such
[23:58:05] <dale> buffers.
[23:58:16] <Osugi> it did say 'package cl is depreciated'
[23:58:23] <johnjay> yes that was a change in 27
[23:58:27] <dale> Osugi: Deprecated cl messages are not a big deal.
[23:58:37] <johnjay> dale: he said he upgraded from 26 to 27
[23:58:37] <Osugi> thanks
[23:58:41] <johnjay> so i thought that might matter
[23:58:46] <dale> johnjay: And indeed it may.

[23:59:29] <johnjay> what's the syntax to tell emacs to specify the init dir other than .emacs.d?
[23:59:39] <johnjay> or actually hold on 
[23:59:56] <johnjay> how about this. check out emacs 26 and compile it. then install emms in it and test?
