[04:29:34] <Voxel> I believe this is correct: "The script may be viewed as a basic browser extension."
[04:34:46] <Voxel> I'm sorry, but is it grammatically correct?
[04:35:03] <TimMc> Yeah, that looks fine.
[04:35:07] <Voxel> Thank you! ^^

[04:35:12] <tinsoldier> TimMc: +7, -0 = 7. Informative (2) 
[04:35:18] <TimMc> I take it to mean "you can think of it this way".
[04:35:28] <Voxel> Exactly!
[04:35:31] <TimMc> And if so, it is idiomatic.
[04:35:44] <Voxel> I'm sorry, but what do you mean?
[04:54:24] <TimMc> Meaning it conforms to a natural way of saying it in English.

[16:47:16] <mdogg> I think it's best to be straight forward with someone if there is something that may need to be corrected.  For example:  "Please review your spelling before sending this email to the team.  There were two misspelled words in the first paragraph alone."  
[16:48:52] <mdogg> Or:  "Please stop leaving your dirty dishes in the sink.  Wash them by hand or put them into the dishwasher."

[20:36:51] <ccp> darsie: In this case it means "from 25,900 to 46,000 (or more)". The Paradigm starts at 25,900 and the Paradigm Plus (which appears to be a different model with different specs, not a trim) starts at 46,000 without being "customized" (possibly this includes options above base trim and not only some kind of bespoke vehicle)

[20:37:56] *** rubber is now known as rber
[20:38:17] <ccp> It's a bit confusing as it is; I would have said "Starting at" instead of "Pricing" 
[20:40:22] <darsie> ccp: Ahh, ok, so like the VW ID.4 comes in 9 or so different variants and with each you can configure extra options.
[20:42:51] <ccp> Anyway, it does suggest some unpredictable range of prices above the base of 46,000 for the Plus, so either the amount of options makes it inconvenient to predict a peak price compared to a handful of trim packages (they might also want to avoid giving the impression that the best model starts at what's actually the bells-and-whistles price), or actual customizations are anticipated
[20:44:25] <ccp> Yeah, I'm guessing the prices are published for the base packages of the variants but if you want to know how much it would be with some particular set of options, you might have to talk to someone?
