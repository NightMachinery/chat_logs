[07:33:52] <masinter> and it depends on what people use common lisp for today
[07:36:38] <masinter> right now it's CLtL1 plus various stuff including this large package IL
[07:47:08] <beach> masinter: What are the questions?  Or do you need to tell us more first?
[07:48:15] <masinter> for the parts that are implementation specific and not in CLtL1 or 2, are there common libraries people rely on?
[07:48:54] <masinter> pathnames, devtools, foreign function call stuff like that?

[07:54:34] <beach> My impression is that many people here use it for web stuff, and yet others rely a lot on FFI.  Me and a few others (but we are likely not representative) use it to write compilers, programming tools, etc.
[07:55:00] <beach> I do think a lot of modern Common Lisp code uses CLOS, so that would be an essential component to add.
[07:55:27] <masinter> there's a PCL implementation of clos but untested for 30 years
[07:56:16] <masinter> we got it to compile and load

[08:00:01] <beach> masinter: I see what you are saying.  I misunderstood before.
[08:00:57] <moon-child> masinter: (that said I expect getting dpans support is a higher priority than implementing support for anything nonportable)
[08:03:38] <masinter> there's another route, which is to port the CL parts of the dev environment to work on a more modern CL
[08:04:00] <moon-child> that works
[08:04:12] <moon-child> less sexy.  Maybe more practical.  Probably more work

[08:07:11] <masinter> you can use medley tools to develop common lisp
[08:07:14] <beach> masinter: The development tools of current FLOOS implementations of Common Lisp are fairly mediocre.
[08:08:43] <beach> masinter: There is no real debugger, because current FLOSS implementations of Common Lisp do not allow for breakpoints.  People use Emacs+SLIME for editing code, but those tools have a very limited "knowledge" of the code being edited.
[08:09:09] <moon-child> (hmm.  One advantage of porting interlisp to cl would be better performance.  I think maiko is still using reference counting and bytecode?)
[08:09:51] <masinter> it's even worse -- the bytecodes emulate a big-endian machine
[08:10:25] <masinter> but it's 3 orders of magnitude faster than it was in its hayday
[08:10:32] <moon-child> only 3?
[08:11:10] <masinter> i know, it's all the byte-swapping
[08:12:12] <masinter> heyday
[08:12:19] <beach> I think porting it to Common Lisp is the more interesting option.
[08:12:47] <beach> Otherwise, you will just have yet another FLOSS Common Lisp implementation to maintain.
[08:13:20] <moon-child> well, presumably the development environment and debugging tools are dependent on implementation-specific functionality
[08:13:57] <moon-child> so, maybe you compile cl->cl, or modify an existing implementation, or interpret cl from cl, but you don't get away from the problem

[08:18:36] <lisp123> masinter: Is there a specification on the various dev tools of InterLisp / Medley and what they do? That could help others to port some of the functionality even though it won't be 1 to 1

[13:23:52] <phoe> what is the concrete behavior of *PRINT-CIRCLE* with regard to Common Lisp primitive types? circle-printing a list like (1 1 1) does not result in (#1=1 #1# #1#) on SBCL
[13:24:11] <phoe> clhs *print-circle*
[13:24:12] <specbot> http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/v_pr_cir.htm
[13:24:21] <phoe> this says, "Note that implementations should not use #n# notation when the Lisp reader would automatically assure sharing without it (e.g., as happens with interned symbols)."
[13:24:54] <phoe> is there a concrete list of such cases anywhere? fixnums would be there, I guess, so would characters and interned symbols
[13:27:18] <moon-child> phoe: iirc sbcl also does not use #n= for bignums
[13:28:04] <phoe> yes, but these are not fixnums and therefore not EQ-comparable, so an implementation can assume that 1 and 1 are the same object and therefore don't use reader labels, whereas bignums don't satisfy that
[13:28:24] <moon-child> fixnums are also not EQ-comparable
[13:29:32] <phoe> that would assume that (1 1) can be printed as (#1=1 #1#) when the implementation cannot assume fixnums are shared
[13:29:45] <moon-child> the definition is somewhat wishy-washy anyway.  'the printer will _endeavor_ to detect cycles' so it's fine it it doesn't succeed?

[16:07:12] <mayuresh> though i am in mumbai suburban region.
[16:07:39] <mayuresh> does anyone here have any idea about the lispworks editor extensibility situation?
[16:08:27] <Xach> mayuresh: the lisp-hug mailing list gave you an answer to that question.
[16:09:15] <Xach> That is also the best place for lispworks questions usually.

[18:27:42] <semz_> Apparently #\Formfeed is not the name for ASCII character number 12 in ECL, but #\Page works there and also in SBCL... Is there a list of character names that all implementations accept? ASCII is enough, I don't expect them to agree on Unicode names.
[18:27:46] *** semz_ is now known as semz
[18:28:30] <semz> I could go with (code-char ascii-code) of course and (rightfully) assume that every implementation is compatible with that, but it feels silly.

[18:43:07] <mayuresh> hello. :)
[18:44:02] <mayuresh> Xach: thanks for the heads-up. waited. finally received those mails from 'hug'.
[18:44:42] <mayuresh> Xach: thanks for your tip. but i think i can't adjust to emacs keyboarding.
[18:45:26] <mayuresh> beach: are you around? or is it too late at your end?
[18:46:26] <jackdaniel> mayuresh: a common approach on irc that is asynchronous is to ask what you want to ask and check logs later whether the person asked responded
[18:46:54] <mayuresh> jackdaniel: thanks. didn't know that.
[18:47:03] <jackdaniel> mayuresh: you may want to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html - this is very useful if you want to learn the "common sense" on irc
[18:47:37] <mayuresh> beach: what should i google for to understand the mnemonics for a common lisp's assembler?
[18:47:56] <mayuresh> jackdaniel: thanks again.
[18:48:01] <jackdaniel> sure
[18:48:41] <mayuresh> beach: do all common lisp implementations use a standard mnemonic for their assembler?
[18:49:25] *** Joins: Bike (~Bike@71.69.170.70)
[18:50:07] <mayuresh> beach: if mnemonics are standardised, what's the case across 'isa'?
[18:51:32] <phoe> I don't think there is one standard across all implementations, simply because some implementations don't use an assembler
[18:51:50] <phoe> unless you count e.g. JVM instructions as an assembly format that ABCL uses, which I guess could pass

[18:52:17] <mayuresh> beach: unix 'as' uses a somewhat standardised mnemonic that varies upto a certain degree with changes in 'isa' targets.

[18:53:55] <mayuresh> beach: glad.

[18:54:47] <beach> I don't know much about the mnemonics used by a Common Lisp assembler.  Cluster (which works only for x86 at the moment) uses the mnemonics defined by Intel and AMD.

[18:56:23] <phoe> jackdaniel: OK, that works
[18:56:32] <beach> mayuresh: No need to be sorry.  I think each architecture defines its own mnemonics.

[18:58:16] <mayuresh> beach: that's true. 'gas' uses an extended form of the unix 'as' mnemonics with minor changes as per 'isa' differences.

[19:00:01] <beach> mayuresh: For a more "standardized" set of instructions, you probably need to go up one abstraction level.  Like Cleavir has some "instructions" for common operations that are the same for all backends.  Those instructions are then translated according to the backend into "assembly code".
[19:01:00] <mayuresh> beach: yeah. but then that would just make is ansi-c. ;)
[19:01:46] <mayuresh> i heard "bryan cantrill" call ansi-c a "portable assembly" language. :D
[19:02:00] <mayuresh> sorry for veering off-topic.
[19:02:08] <phoe> that's a lot of ISA talk th---oh yes
[19:02:09] <beach> C is way too high level for a good compiler backend.  And I am not talking surface syntax here.  All these instructions, including the "assembly code" are in fact represented as a graph of standard objects.  Not text.
[19:02:28] <beach> ... in Cleavir I mean.
[19:04:53] <mayuresh> beach: read the cleavir readme. very interesting. will dig-in once i'm ready.
[19:05:03] <mayuresh> beach: thanks for sharing your work.
[19:05:10] <beach> Pleasure.
[19:12:22] <Bike> llvm-ir is much "lower level" than C, but still isn't really a "portable assembler", in that translating it to actual assembly is quite nontrivial (one llvm-ir instruction could become multiple machine basic blocks, for example). lisp backends seem to go about the same way, like one sbcl virtual operation (VOP) can end up as quite a bit of machine
[19:12:23] <Bike> code. it's interesting. computers are diverse.
[19:14:19] <ldb> I guess there is still not easy way to produce llvm-ir without C++ bindings
[19:21:42] <jackdaniel> Bike: isn't it that llvm performs later machine-specific optimizations?
[19:23:01] <Bike> there is some of that yeah
