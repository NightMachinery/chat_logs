[00:32:38] <whk> i think we found a bug with the erlang ssh_sftp version negotation. from 200+customers 2 using erlang has issues connecting to a particular provider. how do i even log this or try to debug it? help?

[11:50:31] <whk> dch: thanks. i am in sast zone ( morning now ). i will try to replicate the issue here, but still not sure if it is the receiving service or erlang. problem is the the receiving server is some IBM product which I have never used before. everything works when setting sftp_vsn to 3, but not default.

[11:53:52] <whk> unless we can show it is not an erlang bug, it will be hard for us to convince for IBM care, specially because only erlang integrators have the issue. 
[11:55:39] <whk> we have no issues connecting to OpenSSL 1.1.1l, so not sure. 
[11:56:53] <dch> servus
[11:57:20] <dch> whk: do you get any stack traces on your erlang side?
[11:57:48] <dch> and what OTP version are you using
[11:58:46] <whk> we only get it on production, so no direct access. i need to set something up to debug the actual connection. we use hexpm/elixir:1.12.3-erlang-24.0.5-alpine-3.13.5
[12:00:04] <whk> and the issue only appeared after a system update on the IBM side, so it worked before. 
[12:04:08] <dch> cool, I'll have a fiddle here and see how easy it is to get ssh_sftp to spit out some debugging info

[12:11:06] <whk> if i can see the version from ssh_sftp it might help, but could not find a way to do it. i am assuming it connects using a higher version ( as it connects ), but the times out when running ls_dir when there is more than one file available.

[12:31:40] <whk> it connects, but times out on `SFTPClient.list_dir(conn, "Docs")` and only if there is more than one file in the folder

[19:48:39] <jadlr> Ok, solved it :) When I explicitly tell it the type, it works: `type(^row_count, :integer)`
[19:48:53] <jadlr> benwilson512: But thanks for taking interest!
[19:49:22] <jadlr> `type(^value, :integer)` that is...

[20:51:54] <rawtaz> so the new esbuild thing in phoenix 1.6, is it not the same thing as https://esbuild.github.io/ ? i ask because that one seems to be installed using npm (normally, theres other ways too, but it still seems javascript based)
[20:52:31] <benwilson512> rawtaz: yes, installed via npm does not mean it uses node to run
[20:52:42] <benwilson512> and in fact phoenix installs it via hex
[20:52:43] <benwilson512> not npm
[20:52:52] <benwilson512> it's a tool written in go I believe
[20:52:57] <rawtaz> ok. but what does it nstall, is it the Go binary of esbuild?
[20:53:03] <rawtaz> ok thats really nice :D
[20:53:45] <benwilson512> it is indeed
[20:56:44] <josevalim> rawtaz: both the npm package and the elixir package just download the go one from the npm registry
[20:57:17] <rawtaz> cheers, thats awesome
[21:08:35] <rawtaz> here's a long shot question: is there any website or similar that keeps track of / lists all (as in, as many as possible) elixir related talks and presentations? such that one can go there to find the latest talks having been given in various places in the world

[23:04:54] <hoppity> Is it possible to send data from a live view to a regular controller without using params?
[23:08:28] <Nicd> it has to be sent through POST or GET params
[23:08:50] <hoppity> Nicd: thank you
[23:08:52] <Nicd> or otherwise you have to build some kind of transfer thing on the backend like through the database
[23:09:20] <hoppity> makes sense, I am trying to avoid users messing with the parameters and accessing PDFs that they shouldn't
[23:09:49] <Nicd> you need to do access control on every request anyway
[23:09:59] <Nicd> you can't trust a request from the client
[23:11:07] <hoppity> true, and I do have access control, but I want people to have to click the button to generate a PDf and not simply change the parameters in the GET request manually
[23:11:19] <hoppity> but it is not a life and death thing I suppose
[23:11:36] <Nicd> if you have access control then it's no issue if they change the parameters

[23:13:24] <hoppity> nothing, no harm at all
[23:14:00] <hoppity> you are right, it is a waste of my time to try to enforce it
[23:14:08] <hoppity> just wanted to
[23:14:21] <Nicd> if you want to make it more difficult, use POST. but you need to be aware of the UX implications (refresh shows a confusing dialog for example)
[23:15:16] <hoppity> I am considering sticking to liveview and sending the ID (needed for my PDF) via assigns but I could not find a way to have a live view download a PDF (or even present it) to the user.
[23:15:53] <hoppity> That's why I went back to regular controller for this functionality, leveraging the Plug.Conn.send_file function
[23:16:38] <Nicd> I bet you could stream the file over Channels to the client and then save it as blob in client side JS
[23:17:00] <Nicd> of course then you lose caching and sendfile integration
[23:17:02] <hoppity> I'll try something like that, thank you
