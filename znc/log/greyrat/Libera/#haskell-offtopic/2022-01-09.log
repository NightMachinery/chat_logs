[19:48:39] <ProfSimm> What if we make a language where everything is moved, not copied or referenced
[19:48:58] <ProfSimm> Well you can copy it, but explicitly
[19:48:59] *** Joins: coot (~coot@89-64-85-93.dynamic.chello.pl)
[19:49:51] <Rembane> ProfSimm: That sounds like Rust to me. 
[19:50:03] <ProfSimm> It has elements of Rust
[19:50:24] <ProfSimm> But borrowing is not moving
[19:50:29] <ProfSimm> It's moving and teleporting by magic :P
[19:50:39] <Rembane> :D
[19:51:06] <Rembane> I interpret borrowing more like taking a lock on some resource for some time and having the compiler doing all that at compile time. 
[19:51:11] <ProfSimm> Also we should avoid causing the phrase "fighting the borrow checker"
[19:51:18] <ProfSimm> If people are fighting it, means something is off.
[19:51:48] <ProfSimm> Rembane: indeed, and I thought about borrowing but if you get to the implementation stage... too much magic. 
[19:51:58] <ProfSimm> Rembane: what happens if a thread borrows something and crashes.
[19:52:32] <ProfSimm> Rembane: you could say the lock is freed. So then the thing wasn't really borrowed. A token was borrowed, a lock. Meaningless token.
[19:53:00] <ProfSimm> Rembane: I want things to move completely, in a way that's consistent in all cases.
[19:53:53] <ProfSimm> Although crashing is a problem still
[19:54:04] <Rembane> ProfSimm: That sounds interesting. I wonder if there are any papers on this topic. 
[19:54:39] <ProfSimm> Rembane: I'm sure there are. Papers about anything. But I wanna understand it for myself
[19:55:19] <ProfSimm> Rembane: if there's no borrowing it means like in FP you need to use inputs and outputs for everything. So you pass an array to be sorted, and you get back a sorted array
[19:55:28] <hpc> what if, instead of having to do borrowing and shared references
[19:55:32] <ProfSimm> Rembane: exactly like FP, but except you move it around and can mutate it in place
[19:55:46] <hpc> there was a language where every function was its own process, and you passed messages back and forth
[19:56:11] <ProfSimm> hpc: messages have their place, but I don't think they replace moveable objects
[19:56:28] <hpc> what about stoppable forces?
[19:56:32] <ProfSimm> hpc: because the nature of messages are they are small and contextual
[19:56:48] <ProfSimm> hpc: while an object is: here's that thing, you do with it whatever you need and gimme it back after
[19:57:20] <Rembane> ProfSimm: Have you checked out the move semantics in C++? It might give some inspiration.
[19:57:28] <ProfSimm> hpc: its like the difference between loaning a book, and a friending asking you to read that book to them
[19:57:38] <ProfSimm> Rembane: I've checked yes
[19:57:48] <ProfSimm> friend*
[19:58:50] <ProfSimm> Rembane: thing is, move semantics are easy when you do them a little bit, here and there. It gets more interesting if you say "that's it, we make everything move-only"
[19:59:31] <Rembane> ProfSimm: Got it! 
[20:07:57] <ProfSimm> Rembane: it becomes an interesting mix of the benefits of imperative and functional.
[20:08:09] <ProfSimm> Rembane: like functional it's referentially transparent, like imperative, you have mutable data
[20:08:38] <ProfSimm> Maybe a way to get the best of two worlds.
[20:08:58] <ProfSimm> Or maybe it is the real paradigm to begin with, and FP and imperative are distortions of it
[20:09:24] <ProfSimm> I mean we can't have "references" to things in the real world.
[20:09:38] <ProfSimm> Nor we replace the house when we turn on the light in the real world either
[20:09:44] <ProfSimm> So something is off in those paradigms.

[20:10:48] <Rembane> ProfSimm: Sounds fun, build the language and see if it's useful. 
[20:11:07] <ProfSimm> It'll probably be horrible.
[20:11:09] <ProfSimm> :D
[20:11:23] <ProfSimm> But I have the OCD to try and make it usable :P
[20:11:26] <Rembane> :D
[20:11:53] <ProfSimm> I have this inner hope that if it's ontologically correct, then surely there's a way to make it elegant.
