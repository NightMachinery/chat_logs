[02:41:06] <megalithicSethMe> Friends, any of you come across weirdness with these sorts of strings popping up in your lsp source ? I'm using nvim-cmp for the plugin for completion and the cmp-nvim-lsp source: 
[02:41:06] <megalithicSethMe> [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/5506b96e15522ed4b3dd5317/6m2T/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5506b96e15522ed4b3dd5317/6m2T/image.png)
[02:41:38] <megalithicSethMe> this is in a lua buffer
[02:41:43] <megalithicSethMe> in a comment (happens in strings too)
[02:42:09] <megalithicSethMe> and so far i've found some of those strings in ~/.local/share/lsp_servers/bash and a few other places
[02:42:44] <smolck> hmm that seems like it should only happen if you have a source providing it to nvim-cmp
[02:43:09] <smolck> but if you're just using the nvim-lsp source I'm not sure why that'd be happening
[02:43:30] *** Joins: kevr` (~kevr@user/kevr)

[04:38:33] <whompyjaw[m]> luisiaccLuisCC[m: wdym? like snippets?
[04:39:20] <zeraphel> whompyjaw[m]: lsp doesn't typically interact with treesitter afaik, i'd try the simple old method of commenting everything until the error stops and uncommenting until it appears \o/
[04:39:53] <whompyjaw[m]> zeraphel: lol.. no log files to check instead?
[04:39:56] <luisiaccLuisCC[m> no, like if I type `bor` inside a style prop, I would expect to suggest me all the `border...` properties from css
[04:40:38] <zeraphel> whompyjaw[m]: lsp logs in ~/.cache/nvim i dont see any treesitter logs on my machine but you may have some,  might also be something in ~/.local/share/nvim
[04:41:07] <zeraphel> I'm just a lurker on irc,  not a dev

[05:00:27] <TobTobXX> Hmm... when I set a keybinding using nvim_buf_set_keymap, it works, but the keys seem to get interpreted in the global scope too.
[05:00:46] <TobTobXX> eg. I have a mapping that has <Leader>ldd and it deletes a line.
[05:00:56] <TobTobXX> Anyone has a clue how  I could turn that off?
[05:02:56] <TobTobXX> (deleting the line is not inteded, the mapping does something different, but the 'dd' in the mapping gets executed and thus deletes a line)

[11:03:50] <hrsh7th[m]> I think the simple features were implemented but other complex features aren't implemented for now.
[11:03:50] <hrsh7th[m]> Should I implemented these features? I would appreciate your feedback. 
[11:03:50] <hrsh7th[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16499#issuecomment-991848487
[11:04:06] <hrsh7th[m]> Anyway, I'll increase the tests.
[11:05:30] <kylo252[m]> can we use `nvim_win_set_option({window}, {name}, {value})` as `setlocal`? 
[11:05:30] <kylo252[m]> or what's the current way to do this correctly? 
[11:06:58] <numToStr[m]> Isn't `nvim_win_set_option` kinda local? If you are giving it a window id.
[11:08:03] <kylo252[m]> so the use-case maybe isn't that common or relevant outside of dashboard-like plugins
[11:08:33] <kylo252[m]> we'd still be using the same window, so I need it to be buffer local as well
[11:08:47] <kylo252[m]> unless I'm understanding this wrong
[11:09:15] <numToStr[m]> for buffer you might need to use `nvim_buf_set_option`
[11:09:21] <numToStr[m]> (i guess you already know that)
[11:09:41] <kylo252[m]> numToStr[m]: sure, but some options like `number` are actually window-scoped 
[11:11:31] <kylo252[m]> I think it might be this:

[13:02:44] <whompyjaw[m]> <smolck> "> <@goberlan:matrix.org> zeraphe..." <- Of the parsers I have installed--python, cpp, lua, bash--yes, only happens with python and cpp. But, idk if highlighting is built into those parsers? I assume so.
[13:02:45] <whompyjaw[m]> Looking at the troubleshooting guide, there is this:  https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#i-get-error-detected-while-processing-pluginnvim-treesittervim-every-time-i-open-neovim
[13:02:45] <whompyjaw[m]> And I do have 2 parsers: `['/home/user/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/luapacks/start/nvim-treesitter/parser', '/home/user/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
[13:02:45] <whompyjaw[m]> /packer/start/nvim-treesitter/parser']` and so I think it might be that I have 2 parsers, but idk which to get rid of. I will try to reinstall from Grammar, if fail, then try that channel.
[13:05:04] <behelit> Been using treesitter for a while. Love the playground and writing custom queries is so easy/powerful. Indentation didn't really work well for me, however. I tried enabling/disabling it in treesitter, but no luck. With `additional_vim_regex_highlighting` it works as expected, but nvim started feeling slow. Especially with multiple instances open. This morning I just wanted to get some work done so I 
[13:05:10] <behelit> disabled treesitter and everything just seems to work fine. Syntax highlighting for javascriptreact even looks a tad better. Have you had similar issues or is it just me? How do you approach indentation? I program primarily in Rust, Erlang, Python and React/JS.

[13:50:05] <clason[m]> It's likely your config.
[13:51:36] <clason[m]> If you upgraded from an old Neovim version, you likely have to rebuild all parsers (Just `:TSInstall` and say yes.) If it still occurs, you need to rebuild Neovim with the right treesitter library. (Some distributions dynamically link against the system library, and when that gets updated, you run into problems.)
[13:52:00] <clason[m]> In general, for such issues, you should always wipe your plugins and re-start from a minimal config. 
[13:52:23] *** Joins: jklfds (~jklfds@user/jklfds)

[13:53:42] <clason[m]> Treat it as early access, and to see what new stuff is possible with it. I'd stick with the default syntax highlighting and indentation for most languages, though.

[18:32:27] <kylo252[m]> <clason[m]> "those are ancient so basically..." <- if you mean by creation date then yes, but they're not functionally obsolete since the are still way too many headers

[19:16:34] <clason[m]> yep
[19:16:43] <TobTobXX> It provides the capabilities and you have to register them when you start the ls.
[19:17:00] <clason[m]> well, but that's just convenience

[22:26:07] <Popkornium18[m]> Hi, is there some special sauce needed for getting autocompletion for classes from libraries written in Cython working in nvim? I use this library: https://github.com/supermihi/pytaglib
[22:26:07] <Popkornium18[m]> PyCharm manages to autocomplete stuff for the class, Nvim LSP (pyright) somehow doesn't. I'm not sure that it being written in Cython is the reason for the missing completions, just a guess.

[22:32:41] <kylo252[m]> <FernandoChu[m]> "Hey, I'm new on neovim and I was..." <- I think it will get called once you require the first plugin which will happen in the generated `packer_compiled.lua` which is always sourced since it's in a special directory on your `runtimepath` 
[22:32:41] <kylo252[m]> I might be missing something tho ðŸ˜…
[22:38:54] <mva> hi there! Advice me please, how do packer decides if added package should be added to &runtimepath?
[22:38:56] <mva> The situation: I'm adding https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo-syntax as `use { 'gentoo/gentoo-syntax' }`, and I found that if I open multiple files only the first going to have syntaxes applied to it, and others don't even got filrtype set to it. I found that somewhy there is no `gentoo-syntax` in paths in &rtp... Is there any way to influence this?
[22:39:11] <clason[m]> it doesn't 
[22:39:41] <FernandoChu[m]> > <@kylo252:matrix.org> I think it will get called once you require the first plugin which will happen in the generated `packer_compiled.lua` which is always sourced since it's in a special directory on your `runtimepath` 
[22:39:41] <FernandoChu[m]> > I might be missing something tho ðŸ˜…
[22:39:41] <FernandoChu[m]> Thanks! Got it
[22:39:42] <clason[m]> it puts things in `packpath`, which Neovim internally reads for runtimefiles
[22:40:07] <clason[m]> (unless you mark it as `opt` or lazy-load, which you should only do if you you know what you're doing)
[22:41:03] <clason[m]> What you describe sounds like something is wrong with the plugin?
[22:41:05] <mva> no, I don't mark it as opt (I even tried to intentionally set opt to false, which presumable had no effect, since it is already not opt )
[22:41:33] <clason[m]> yeah, sorry, just saw your code snippet (it didn't get highlighted, so I missed it)
[22:41:44] <clason[m]> should be working -- and the fact that it does for the first file, shows that it does
[22:41:45] <mva> but still I don't find it in &rtp, but it applies to the file that got opened on nvim's start
[22:41:46] *** Joins: amichaelc (~amichaelc@user/amichaelc)
[22:42:51] <clason[m]> depending on your Neovim version, `rtp` contains globs, so not every directory is listed individually (in fact, that is one of the nice things in 0.6.0 ;))
[22:43:02] <mva> (or, well, at least "first" file. As when I call `nvim file1 file2` - file2 don't even get highlighted or even filetype set to it)

[22:54:55] <mva> also interesting thing: when I disabled impatienv.nvim and requiring packer_compiled, I got *another* plugins to not apply their configuretion :shrug:
[22:56:34] <mva> uh, no

[23:00:26] <clason[m]> yep
[23:00:38] <clason[m]> something is fishy with your setup, but hard to tell what
[23:00:42] <kylo252[m]> I'm 90% sure there's an RTP flag or handling of some sort in packer
[23:01:19] <clason[m]> I'd suggest to wipe your config and package paths and set things up from scratch

[23:09:53] <mva> btw, I also found that (actually, pretty predictably, if think about it, but still) doing, for example, `config = require"cfg.barbar"` (which sets a bunch of `vim.g`'s) to configure `barbar` doesn't work (without using `require"packer_compiled"`).
[23:10:42] <clason[m]> yes, that's correct
[23:10:56] <clason[m]> well, partly.
[23:10:59] <mva> I guess, that that behaviour is because globals got set after plugin is loaded and it doesn't care of runtime changes 
[23:11:14] <clason[m]> `:h startup`
[23:11:25] <nvim-bot[m]> Links to referenced help pages:
[23:11:25] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`startup`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#startup) in *starting.txt*
[23:11:39] <mva> but what is better way? There can be plugins that require them to be already loaded for their configuration
[23:11:41] <clason[m]> it's important to learn in what order Neovim loads what file
[23:11:56] <clason[m]> use the `after` key in packer
[23:12:24] <mva> and I'd also want to have plugin configurations it separate configs (and not spread it over all the "base" configuration files)
[23:13:06] <clason[m]> put your config into `plugin/<foo>.lua`
[23:13:13] <mva> clason[m]: IIRC, after is only applicable to "run this after another package", isn't it?
[23:13:28] <clason[m]> yes
[23:13:36] <clason[m]> isn't that what you want?
[23:14:49] <InternetCitizen> I have a syn match 'true' right before a syn match '[a-z][a-zA-Z_0-9]*' but still, "true" appears as an identifer and not a bool
[23:15:06] *** Joins: FluffyMask (~masque@user/fluffymask)
[23:16:20] <mva> actually, not exactly. I want to load plugin configurations only if plugin [goes to be] loaded (and in some cases plugin configs assumes plugin *is* already loaded), and I also want to take control whether it should be added before or after the plugin loaded, I guess. Or, maybe reload the plugin after applying configuration :shrug
[23:16:26] <InternetCitizen> wait, when I remove my idenfier match, true just goes blank
[23:16:36] <InternetCitizen> how do I match again "true" ?
[23:16:40] <InternetCitizen> against

[23:17:54] <zeraphel> InternetCitizen: is 'true' an identifier?  if so shouldnt Identifier be a syntax cluster and 'true' an item contained within it?
[23:18:21] <InternetCitizen> no that's the thing, true is a Boolean
[23:18:41] <clason[m]> mva: there's also the `setup` key for config that needs to happen _before_ the plugin is loaded
[23:18:41] <InternetCitizen> a boolean constant 
[23:19:08] <InternetCitizen> but doing syn match 'true' doesn't match against it
[23:19:14] <InternetCitizen> why?
[23:19:16] <mva> clason[m]: true point, thanks!
[23:19:42] <InternetCitizen> I tried '/true' too
[23:19:55] <zeraphel> InternetCitizen: hold on,  are you using :match or :syntax match
[23:20:23] <InternetCitizen> I wrote "syn match langBool 'true'"
[23:20:47] <InternetCitizen> so I suppose :syntax match
[23:21:24] <zeraphel> no that's good.  just making sure that you're doing what i think you're doing.  :match is often used interactively. you didn't explicitly state you're writing a syntax file
[23:22:58] <InternetCitizen> sorry I thought it was obvious, it's my first time doing this :P
[23:24:26] <zeraphel> afaik syntax matches cannot overlap eachother.  the order in which they are defined should not matter
[23:24:38] <InternetCitizen> I took a peek in ruby.vim and found: "\%#=1\<\%(true\|false\)\>[?!]\@!" what ???
[23:24:45] <InternetCitizen> zeraphel: oh
[23:25:04] <InternetCitizen> I thought the order mattered :/
[23:29:33] <zeraphel> that's a pretty neat pattern,  \%# cursor position, \%() noncapturing group, \@! negative lookbehind.  It's all described in :help pattern.txt,  i suspect you're already reading :help usr_44 but just pointing out the obvious.  anyway gotta go
