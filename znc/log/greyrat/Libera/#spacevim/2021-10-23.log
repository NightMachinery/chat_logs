[14:24:13] <SpaceVimBot> <woss:matrix.org> what is the shortcut for focusing on the terminal once opened?
[14:25:00] <SpaceVimBot> <woss:matrix.org> `SPACE + '` is to open it, then i accidently press a letter ( which one ??? ) and it focuses it.
[16:24:18] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> @woss:matrix.org I do not understand your question. `SPC '` will open floating shell, and the focuses on it.
[16:24:46] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> you can use ``ctrl-` `` to hidden the terminal
[16:26:25] <SpaceVimBot> <woss:matrix.org> yes, exactly. but then i start editing files, and then i always press `SPACE + '` to focus it, but sometimes when i am not in INSERT mode and press a letter ( not sure which one ) it focuses on the terminal. that's the question about. which letter is that?
[16:30:17] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> `SPC '` is not for insert mode
[16:30:41] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> if you are not in insert mode, just use `SPC '` to open terminal
