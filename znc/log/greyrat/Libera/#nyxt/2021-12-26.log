[00:10:29] <aartaka> opalvaults[m]: exactly, we rely on KeePassXC clipboard handling. As a yet another low-hanging fruit: documenting which packages KeePassXC depends on and how to troubleshoot password manager problems will be a great addition to our manual, if you'd want to contribute it :)

[03:49:22] <opalvaults[m]> I already did actually!
[03:49:26] <opalvaults[m]> I'll make a pull request.
[03:49:41] <opalvaults[m]> aartaka: I wanted to separate that section from the previous PR.
[03:50:44] <opalvaults[m]> It's a small PR, but I actually didn't know I needed xclip so I'm sure that'd be good knowledge.
[03:52:51] <opalvaults[m]> looks like Emacs parinfer.el autoformatted everything in manual.lisp (and/or I have something autoformatting indentation), should I remove the autoformatting before I submit this?
[03:53:10] <opalvaults[m]> afk for the night btw, happy holidays all! :)

[22:59:29] <opalvaults[m]> I've been experiencing some crashes with Nyxt randomly. I've opened up nyxt with -vvv, I'll report what I can. Has anyone else experienced random crashes? I feel like it's due to some hook but I can't tell where.
[23:06:47] <mariari> often I get webkit crashes
[23:08:35] <opalvaults[m]> Do you have a copy of any of the messages?

[23:49:52] <mariari> I've posted them before often it's segfault with no backtraces
[23:49:58] <mariari> other times it's a memory limit exhausted
[23:50:04] <mariari> with a backtrace of any operation that allocates
[23:53:17] <opalvaults[m]> ahh, gotcha. I'll see if my crashes are similar then
