[13:17:58] <yelhamer> Hello, I'm a student taking my first steps into deep learning, I'm looking for recommendations on platforms to train/run my models. So far I've been using colab free and I've been experiencing some inconsistency issues (my notebook sometimes abruptly halts execution and i get disconnected from the runtime), so far I'm looking at colab pro, paperspace gradient, kaggle... Which one would you recommend
[13:18:02] <yelhamer> ?
[13:18:04] <yelhamer> I'm not quiet sure what type of neural nets I'll be using for my school project, but so far I've been working with U-net and I might also have to use an RNN, Access to Google Drive is a huge pro for me (since I have my datasets there and I don't want to reupload them), but if I can get around it for other platforms then I'm okay with that.
