[01:30:10] <Aavar_> Hi. I am trying to create my first container from a dockerfile I have created. THe container is based on ubuntu and after running an apt-command it asks me a question about my location (when configuring tzdata). I am able to select my location, but after that it hangs... anyone know wny?

[04:20:57] <Sven_vB> hi :) some days ago I was advised to use docker-compose's "exec" command rather than look up the container name for use with docker's "exec". my docker-compose is dockerized though. is it a substantial extra effort for my server to boot up a docker container to run docker-compose to run my exec?
[04:21:47] <Sven_vB> i.e. would it be justified to instead make a small bash script that finds the name and execs, rather than boot a real docker-compose?

[04:57:56] <Sven_vB> I haven't tried yet. I just assumed it would be much effort to create a temporary container, and clean it up later (hopefully)
[05:01:47] <Sven_vB> running the dockerized docker-compose with just "--version" takes almost 5 seconds already, so I guess this proves a UI advantage for my bash script idea.
[05:02:35] <Sven_vB> thanks for reminding me to actually measure. :)

[07:23:41] <dobbicorp> jk

[07:26:45] <lantech19446> I asked the same thing and i was told it's normal
[07:27:06] <lantech19446> the answer to why it's not working is my class never told me to do docker login
[07:27:32] <njka> uhhh
[07:28:30] <dobbicorp> lantech19446: i believe you can create a user with docket group

[07:29:26] <njka> well, you need to use sudo to restart/start/stop docker itself... but you shouldn't need sudo to do anything to your images ( assuming they're not owned by root )
[07:29:46] <King-Bob> or you can giveyour use access to docker and not need sudo
[07:29:51] <King-Bob> give your user

[07:37:00] <njka> King-Bob: no, he was not referring to to start/stopping the docker daemon
[07:37:09] <njka> he was wondering about "docker commit"
[07:37:21] <njka> which 100% does *not* require sudo
[07:37:22] <lantech19446> King-Bob: no up until a few minutes ago I needed sudo to do everything in docker, could have something to do with the fact that there's only one user on the server or the fact that it's a server and not a client idk
[07:37:45] <lantech19446> i did finally get push and commit to work i didn't know about docker login
[07:37:46] <njka> lantech19446: something isn't right w/your docker installation then bro :(

[07:38:41] <njka> cim: i have never eaten at a red lobster
[07:39:50] <King-Bob> do volumes connected using a folder ie -v /blah:/blah update realtime?

[07:56:48] <lantech19446> i use it for keeping things up to date and changing stuff that a gpo is less than optimal for but i want to do a full deployment with it
[07:57:10] <njka> ansible?
[07:59:06] <lantech19446> yes
[07:59:42] <King-Bob> so whats the best way to mount data to ensure mutlilpe containers always have an updated file.. i keep finding if files are generated by 1 container the 2nd can't see it till it restarts
[08:02:00] <King-Bob> nm i'm an idiot i figured out why 
[08:02:10] <King-Bob> i was mounting a founder that don't exist =(
[08:02:15] <King-Bob> folder
[08:03:27] <lantech19446> so say i were to run an image of debian jessie if I were to do docker run -it -d -p 6000 debian:jessie would i be able to access that image over port 6000?
[08:04:27] <King-Bob> so you would be exposing port 6000 but is there something listening on the host on that?
[08:04:48] <lantech19446> no it's literally just a debian server
[08:05:58] <King-Bob> so you wouldn't really be able to connect to it 
[08:06:25] <King-Bob> to learn how ports work try spinning up a webserver with ngix or something
[08:07:31] <King-Bob> when i first starting learning docker i started with like datqbases and simple applications then went over to learn how to build images
[08:07:39] <lantech19446> I get how port forwarding works and listeners but i was hoping there was some way to force it to listen on a specific port
[08:07:53] <King-Bob> thats what -p does
[08:08:33] <King-Bob> so lets say i have a web server running on port 80 in the container but in real world i want port 8080 to be the port i access it on

[08:08:55] <King-Bob> you would run the docker container with -p 8080:80 
[08:09:10] <King-Bob> that way when you connect to yuorhostname:8080 it will goto the internal port 8
[08:09:11] <King-Bob> 80]
[08:09:54] *** Joins: millido (~millido@84.210.150.128)
[08:10:09] <lantech19446> right but i still need some service on 80 I can't make the entire server accessible over a port to be able to navigate trees and whatnot
[08:10:26] <King-Bob> yeah you still need something on the server thats listening
[08:10:46] <lantech19446> I think tomorrow i'm going to build a backup of my works webserver on debian and make it accessible via my own link
[08:11:08] <King-Bob> what webserver you use?
[08:11:51] <lantech19446> I used apache2 for the webserver at work for my page I used generic httpd on rhel only one i really haven't fucked with yet is tomcat and nginx

[18:33:14] <zamba> is there a command to search for available images on a docker registry?
[18:33:24] <AquaL1te> hi, i want to use the variable VERSION_CODENAME from /etc/os-release in a dockerfile. but this is troublesome because the dockerfile uses /bin/sh and not /bin/bash. what's a nice fix for this to source this variable? changing to bash as the default shell perhaps?
[18:34:41] <BtbN> I don't see anything that'd require bash for that?
[18:35:16] *** Quits: pidroid (~pidroid@user/pidroid) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[18:35:16] <AquaL1te> source is a bash builtin, right? it fails when trying to do `RUN source /etc/os-release`
[18:35:30] <BtbN> source is not bash specific.
[18:35:35] <BtbN> It's a very basic shell feature.
[18:35:36] *** Joins: pidroid (~pidroid@user/pidroid)
[18:35:50] <ikke> source is not POSIX
[18:35:54] <ikke> use .
[18:35:59] <BtbN> If you do "RUN source ..." it's pointless though
[18:36:07] <AquaL1te> BtbN: how could I then include the /etc/os-release vars into the ENV?
[18:36:08] <BtbN> it'll source it into the shell of that RUN, which then promptly exits
[18:36:17] <BtbN> I don't think you reasonably can
[18:36:33] <BtbN> you can source it at the beginning of a RUN, and then commands running after it in the same RUN will see the vars.

[19:00:55] <programmerq> fowl: that seems like a bug. are you using the regular docker builder, or have you turned on the buildx builder?

[19:01:17] <programmerq> since it has the built in qemu-binfmt stuff?

The SSO domain for those organizations may need to be reverified.
