[01:04:58] <FunkyBob> even outside of django
[01:05:02] <b-rex> for me the "most recent X" might be inaccurate because i have a is_draft flag on the messages
[01:05:09] <FunkyBob> lateral joins or window functions tend to be involved, I think
[01:05:28] <b-rex> by annotating with Max(), i potentially pull in the draft instead of the last "sent" message (is_draft=False)

[01:19:33] <FunkyBob> b-rex: the forms comment was an oops, it wasn't meant for you
[01:19:59] <b-rex> oh my bad
[01:20:13] <FunkyBob> what on earth is that loop in lines 7-9??
[01:20:46] <FunkyBob> every user except the last one?
[01:21:08] <b-rex> that is because line 3 creates a list of tuples containing every user but some of them have no messages, so i'm filtering them out
[01:21:18] <FunkyBob> ah, I see
[01:21:36] <FunkyBob> User.objects.filter(messages_created__isnull=False)
[01:22:05] <b-rex> here's the logic i'm trying to achieve in english: for every user, give me the latest message and only the latest message that has is_draft=False
[01:22:11] <FunkyBob> or post-filter on latest_message_created_at ...
[01:22:39] <FunkyBob> for every user who has non-draft messages, you mean?
[01:22:46] <b-rex> yes
[01:22:57] <b-rex> some users will have no messages at all, others might have only draft messages.
[01:23:29] <jim> GinFuyou, so I copied the files of the site, other than the database file. I did migrate, and runserver... worked fine for a few minutes, but then started getting the same behavior as before
[01:23:58] <jim> so then it's probably not the database, but something in the files
[01:24:18] <jim> I should repeat the tutorial from scratch
[01:24:25] <b-rex> my end result would be a list of messages that is one message (the latest non-draft message) per user
[01:25:07] <FunkyBob> b-rex: yeah, I'd still go the window approach I said before

[01:32:44] <FunkyBob> they work a bit like aggregates, but don't reduce the row count
[01:33:10] <b-rex> ok so Rank() with no expressions i'm assuming just increments by 1 each row?
[01:44:55] <b-rex> no it does not. also you cannot .filter() after using Window
[01:49:17] <jim> GinFuyou, ruled out the database as the problem... and ruled out my files: I started a new project, didn't even migrate yet, and same behavior. so: the problem must be in the installation of django in the venv
[01:49:43] <jim> I'm gonna blow that away, and install again
[01:51:24] <jim> I got another possibility: I have a 2.2.25 django installed from the debian package, maybe that interfered

[19:10:33] <pycode> hello everybody
[19:10:33] <GinFuyou> you are missing (non-empty) of value qz2.id
[19:10:45] <pycode> does django have a tree queryset ?
[19:10:54] <pycode> i am building a simple permission system
[19:10:57] <GinFuyou> do debug prints to know why it's empty or not set
[19:11:31] <pycode> and some permissions are grouped hierarchically
[19:11:48] <pycode> is it possible? or do i need two model Group -> Permission
[19:12:07] <pycode> the problem here is when i need 3 nested levels
[19:13:27] <GinFuyou> What is actual problem? SQL is not very tree-friendly, but some things surely can be done with ORM directly, and there are tree-related libs for django
[19:14:50] <pycode> ok
[19:15:23] <pycode> last thing GinFuyou i have a doubt regarding this permission system i am building, i have some roles that if are set to True automatically "exclude" (Set as False) other
[19:15:46] <pycode> should i do that programmatically or are there other ways?
[19:17:35] <GinFuyou> something could be done with setting constraints on models, but I haven't digged it deeply
[19:19:37] <pycode> GinFuyou, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/constraints/#checkconstraint
[19:19:38] <pycode> ?
[19:20:14] <pycode> but i do not know, i do not raise an error, i just need to put False to a list
[19:20:18] <pycode> of other permissions
[19:21:27] <GinFuyou> well, this you can only do yourself in python. Most likely there is DB-SQL way of doing it, but I'm not good with it
[19:21:59] <GinFuyou> but since constraints are translated to DB level they ensure consistency of data, which is very good thing
