[03:00:01] <greyrat> The invite here was one of few spam messages I have gotten that might actually be useful ;)
[03:00:28] <Joanna> Hi gunni welcome
[03:00:31] <Gunni> I got it to... Why spam a channel that seems legit?
[03:00:52] <Joanna> No spamming involved
[03:02:46] <Gunni> Uh, I define spam as messages received via any medium telling me to click something or go somewhere or to reply with some information..
[03:04:08] <Joanna> Sorry but I had no other way to contact you ;)
[03:22:35] <catbeard> Joanna: /msg MemoServ send <nick> <message>
[03:27:02] <Joanna> catbeard: yea that’s true :) but that’s for people who are offline usually
[03:29:01] <catbeard> like you :)
[03:29:27] <Joanna> Indeed
[03:30:36] <Joanna> But I’m online almost everyday so I’m not difficult to find

[09:54:10] <Joanna> Or maybe a similar name as someone I knew
[09:54:14] <ElPresidente> Possible. But I didn't use IRC as often as I do now.
[09:54:22] <ElPresidente> on fn
[09:54:30] <Joanna> The person on freenode was from Indonesia
[09:55:00] <ElPresidente> oh that was definitely not me then lol

[09:56:48] <Joanna> Hi grobi welcome
[09:57:02] <ElPresidente> is this an invite only channel?

[17:14:35] <Joanna> catbeard: what is open invite ?+g? I’ve never heard of it before
[17:14:48] <catbeard> it's so non-op/non-voice can /invite
[17:15:17] <Joanna> Anyone can come here if they are registered
[17:15:25] <Joanna> Hmm
[17:15:55] <catbeard> right but nobody but ops can /invite
[17:16:02] <catbeard> presently
[17:16:07] <Joanna> But you can invite by giving channel name
[17:16:23] <catbeard> sure, but with +g you can just /invite from here without pm spam
[17:16:26] <Joanna> I don’t think this channel is invite only
[17:16:28] <catbeard> or spamming other channels
[17:16:32] <catbeard> it doesn't have to be
[17:16:39] <catbeard> it just unlocks /invite for non-ops
[17:17:10] <Joanna> Hmm let me look into it I’ve never heard of it before
[17:21:10] <catbeard> i have it set on #hottub
[17:21:15] <Joanna> Still looking
[17:25:24] <Joanna> Ok

[18:13:46] <_inky> hello people
[18:15:18] <Joanna> Hi _inky
[18:15:29] <_inky> some news, that are not really news:
[18:15:31] <_inky> https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/protonmail-logged-ip-address-of-french-activist-after-order-by-swiss-authorities/
[18:15:52] <Joanna> Ah I think I’ve heard that before
[18:16:17] <_inky> and this is an article i promised about malware in russian dumbphones: https://therecord.media/malware-found-preinstalled-in-classic-push-button-phones-sold-in-russia/
[18:16:21] <_inky> well phones sold in russia.
[18:16:46] <_inky> also this is interesting article i did not really fully understand.
[18:16:47] <_inky> https://blog.adacore.com/when-the-isa-is-the-weakest-link
[18:17:01] <catbeard> in soviet russia, phone calls you
[18:17:09] <_inky> so security researchers were hired to find bugs in ada/spark implementation.
[18:17:28] <_inky> but eventually they found a bug in risc-v isa, so instruction set architecture probably, not implementation?
[18:17:30] <_inky> don't really understand.
[18:17:38] <_inky> catbeard: heh, exactly!
[18:20:07] <Joanna> Actually I didn’t see all the details of that story before. When it comes down to it people will divulge information and the only certain way to prevent this is to avoid sharing information as much as possible
