[16:50:03] <tcarls[m]> Ahh. NixOS has stopped trying to package 3.7 at all, so there are no hints I can take from its build.
[16:52:20] <tcarls[m]> ...if you're open to using Nix rather than the native package manager, it does make it easy to pull in a specific version of boost -- has a `boost169` derivation f/e.
[16:53:03] <tcarls[m]> (and given how Nix works, you can install one version of a package in such a way as to bring it into scope only while working on a specific project, while having a different version active at all other times).

[18:43:42] <duude__> Hey people
[18:43:50] <duude__> I saw this https://wiki.opendigitalradio.org/FM_transmission_on_many_channels_using_gnuradio
[18:44:04] <duude__> And I was wondering, does it have to be this bloated?
[18:44:24] <duude__> Like, what if he wanted to have instead of 3, like.. I don't know.. 10 channels
[18:44:34] <duude__> He would have a ton of add/multiply blocks as well as signal sources
[18:44:38] <duude__> Is there a smarter way of doing this?
[18:52:40] <tcarls[m]> A different multiply per channel makes sense because you need to shift them by a different amount.
[18:52:59] <tcarls[m]> if the add block can't support more than two inputs, it'd be easy to write your own custom version that does.
[18:53:26] <tcarls[m]> * different amount, and you need a separate complex wave per channel to determine that amount.
[18:54:17] <tcarls[m]> If you wanted to build a single block that did it all, I don't see any reason that couldn't be done, but that wouldn't be making there be fewer operations, it would just be consolidating those operations.
[18:55:35] <tcarls[m]> * that does. (edit: I see that it does, and that the proposal already uses it)
[18:56:00] <tcarls[m]> * that does. (edit: I see that it does, and that the flowgraph already uses it -- so no reason for more than one add block)
[18:56:17] <tcarls[m]> * that does. (edit: I see that it does, and that the flowgraph already uses it -- so no reason for more than one add block, no matter how many channels are in use)
[19:00:22] <duude__> tcarls: I see, so in order to shift them you must have signal sources and multiply them
[19:00:28] <duude__> There's just no way around it
[19:00:55] <duude__> That is if they're at various different frequencies
[19:03:17] <duude__> If they were all the same err "distances", you could've done it then using the polyphase synthetizer
[19:03:32] <duude__> but otherwise, X signal sources and X multiply blocks, yeah? haha

[23:21:55] <warnes[m]> Thanks jholtom muaddib 
[23:22:59] <muaddib[m]> looks like this worked 4 years ago, i think i used it earlier this year on something
[23:22:59] <muaddib[m]> ```docker run -t -i --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb ```
[23:24:35] <muaddib[m]> warnes: are you trying to build an SDR app in docker that connects to your VM that connects to your host's USB?
[23:24:47] <jholtom> yeah, you probably do still need privileged, though at least on podman
[23:25:35] <warnes[m]> No, I'm hoping, in my VM, to build a docker image that I can run directly using  MacOS docker.
[23:25:48] <jholtom> warnes[m]: there is no such thing as macOS docker.
[23:26:00] <jholtom> macOS docker is another vm running linux, that runs the linux docker socket
[23:26:41] <warnes[m]> Really?
[23:26:57] <jholtom> yes
[23:27:14] <warnes[m]> Crazy.
[23:27:18] <jholtom> not at all
[23:27:27] <jholtom> docker is a technology that relies on linux kernel features
[23:27:35] <jholtom> Darwin/XNU doesn't have them
[23:27:48] <jholtom> nor does the NT kernel, therefore docker doesn't work, and you have to have a linux vm to run it in
[23:28:08] <jholtom> in theory they do have the features, but they're not fleshed out enough to develop a competing container tech (not that MS hasn't tried)
[23:28:47] <warnes[m]> I'm surprised that Apple and MS haven't build the features to do that.
[23:32:09] <warnes[m]> Ok, so it's not that much different to run my SDR code in a Parallels VM and in a Docker Desktop VM.
[23:32:17] <warnes[m]> In both cases, there's a whole Linux VM running.
[23:32:27] <jholtom> yes
[23:32:31] <jholtom> there is no difference basically
[23:32:36] <HkonVgsether[m]> > <@chitresh:gnuradio.org> Hello! My name is Chitresh Goel, final year student pursuing computer engineering from India.
[23:32:36] <HkonVgsether[m]> > I would like to know the ideas for GSoC 2022. 
[23:32:36] <HkonVgsether[m]> Great! I would suggest checking out this page in about a week (maybe two): https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GSoCIdeas
[23:32:43] <warnes[m]> Any performance difference?
[23:32:57] <jholtom> no, not really
[23:33:13] <jholtom> if anything, running a docker container might put a very small overhead on you
[23:33:25] <jholtom> but probably not detectable unless you're really pushing

[23:43:16] <muaddib[m]> warnes: this sounds like its not really your use case, **but** if you _were_ going to run anything DSP-wise in a docker container that's running on a Linux host. If you can build GNURadio on the Linux host, you could setup a simple flowgraph with the radio source/sink and pipe samples to/from the container over ZMQ. jholtom would you say that's a better approach overhead and performance wise? That's assuming you actually need to do the
[23:43:16] <muaddib[m]> processing in a docker (i.e. a GNURadio 3.7 OOT) 
[23:57:52] <jholtom> muaddib[m]: honestly that would probably be somewhat better
[23:57:59] <jholtom> less virtualization overhead
[23:58:27] <jholtom> I've done some stuff before where I isolate multiple radios on one computer to each docker container
[23:58:49] <jholtom> but the ZMQ approach is probably cleaner and more efficient probably
[23:58:55] <jholtom> I'd have to think about it some
