[06:15:14] <av11> i'm trying to make a console based prototype for a card game and i want to have the functionality of C's getch, so i figured a way to implement an equivalent of that might be to read directly from the input stream...
[06:16:23] <Elw3> Was that a question?
[06:16:38] <av11> it ended with an ellipses so i'm not done lol
[06:16:47] <av11> just not sure if theres a character limit in irc
[06:17:45] <av11> but how might i have a statement pause runtime to listen to the input stream for one character? unlike io.read(1) where it requires a newline
[06:20:34] <furq> there's no portable way to do that
[06:20:36] *** Quits: ano (~ano@user/ano) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:20:36] <furq> it depends on the shell
[06:20:54] <av11> ah bugger
[06:21:00] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[06:21:27] <Elw3> You could of course just add that as a C snipped.
[06:21:34] <furq> you can hack around it with stty on *nix but on windows you'd need to call a C function
[06:21:41] <furq> at which point you might as well just call getch directly
[06:22:28] <av11> oh i figured i'd need to do some complex crap to import it
[06:22:57] <av11> i'll check my PIL book on the C API section
[06:23:45] <Elw3> Do you need to know which key?
[06:23:56] <av11> yeah lol, it's a game
[06:24:05] <Elw3> :D riiight
[06:24:18] <av11> not flappy bird lmao
[06:24:31] <Elw3> But maybe you where in a "press any key" scenario.
[06:25:05] <av11> nah i need to be able to use arrow keys to change a selection

[06:26:26] <Elw3> Terminal games are cool, but somehow they always end up even less portable than one made with proper toolkit.
[06:26:27] <av11> i use a gamestate system, where the lowest level of the program runs a loop that clears the console and runs the game.state function
[06:27:57] <av11> it's all really just supposed to be a prototype so i can try my hand at making AI for the first time

[06:29:19] <av11> ncurses always seemed complicated but i'll probably eventually get around to learning it one day
[06:29:49] <Elw3> My last one was a two stages system: one script printed the state of the buttons in the form of zeros and ones and printed it into the pipe of the actual game 60 times a second, the game however was a script that whenever given a set of buttons it printed out a new frame.
[06:30:18] <furq> there are wrappers for termbox although idk which one is recommended any more
[06:30:29] <furq> and there's that termfx library on top of termbox although it doesn't look very active
[06:30:40] <av11> oh neat
[06:30:46] <Elw3> Just use a proper toolkit, its way less trouble to prototype in that.
[06:30:48] <ubq323> ncurses isn't too complicated
[06:31:12] <av11> i just dont want to bother with graphics rn

[06:31:22] <Elw3> You dont have to.

[06:31:51] <av11> i dont know of any of my options for toolkits
[06:31:55] <Elw3> But you dont have to worry about where to get the buttons from
[06:32:05] <Elw3> Use löve2d
[06:32:19] <Elw3> Its a solid binding to sdl.
[06:32:32] <av11> whats sdl lol
[06:33:00] <av11> oh this looks rad
[06:33:01] <Elw3> simple direct layer, a normed cross plattform way to access hardware
[06:33:08] <av11> ohh
[06:34:14] <av11> yeah, conditional trees for input characters already looks like a nightmare to manage and i've only done the first state of the game, setup
[06:34:31] <av11> so i'll rewrite in this, thanks
[06:34:34] <Elw3> If you want to use that you can disable the window module and overwrite the main loop with your own, then you just end up with a terminal system that has bindungs for buttons.
[06:35:02] <Elw3> What card game is it supposed to be?
[06:35:20] <Elw3> I did poker in lua already but no one wants to play with me...
[06:35:36] <av11> Sedma, a Czech game with a German deck, in which suits don't matter, so i don't need to draw cards
[06:36:12] <av11> it's a simple yet unusual trick-taking game that i think is the most fun two person card game ive ever played
[06:36:38] <av11> well, two or four, but only ever played with just my dad
[06:37:15] <Elw3> oO
[06:38:14] <av11> yeah i hope to implement a basic netcode eventually for p2p play
[06:38:34] <av11> i need to expose this cool ass game to more people
[06:39:09] <Elw3> Just make it in irc

[06:41:00] <av11> i have zero code experience with irc
[06:41:14] <Elw3> yea its the standard.
[06:41:14] <Elw3> My pokerbot sends ♥♦♠♣ and such
[06:41:20] <av11> oh SWEET
[06:42:04] <av11> shiet ok..... so uh, would i not need to use love2d then?
[06:42:31] <Elw3> Its still good to prototype the game in it.
[06:42:45] <av11> actually wait this would be terrible for a game in which your hand is private lol
[06:43:03] <Elw3> Do you want to have my pokerbot as reference?
