[11:36:18] <digitok> you want to know the position of <tc> relative to <tr>?

[11:48:22] <digitok> the position of each would be the total count from the current and all previous results

[17:12:26] <Shweta> actually it is replacing entire str with the changes value.. i only want to replace the phone numbers in the sentence
[17:12:52] <Shweta> also i want to keep the indexing part so that it is dynamically masked as and when needed
[17:14:03] <Shweta> hi
[17:15:21] <digitok> 3 and 4 are always the same?
[17:16:04] <Shweta> no no they can be changes
[17:16:08] <Shweta> changed*

[17:19:26] <digitok> is this correct
[17:19:36] <Shweta> yes Sir

[17:22:01] <digitok> 3 digits, space, 4 digits, space, 4 digits
[17:23:03] <Shweta> Ok fine
[17:23:25] <Shweta> Also do you have any regex pattern that supports all kinds of phone number
[17:23:46] <Shweta> let say for some we have hyphen instead of space
[17:24:03] <Shweta> or for some we have +98 as the country code
[17:24:24] <digitok> yes, phone numbers are complex
[17:25:57] <Me-me> Unreasonably so.
[17:26:23] <Shweta> can you share common regex for such numbers ?
[17:26:34] <Me-me> !phone
[17:26:34] <perlbot> A simple (###) ###-#### phone number validator could be: /^\(?(\d{3})\)? ?(\d{3})-?(\d{4})$/ -- For anything else, we recommend libphonenumber or another library.
[17:27:15] <Shweta> ok

[17:51:58] <pgimeno> There is a kind of expression that is not a regular expression, it is like a simplified form of REs. The grammar is similar but not all expressions are valid; maybe only those that don't need to backtrack are valid or something like that. I think it was used in some kind of XML related stuff like DTD validation, XSLT or XPath; however I can't find it. If anyone has an idea of what I'm talking about, could you please tell me the name of these expressions?

[18:11:33] <NiLon> pgimeno maybe you mean basic regex
[18:12:00] <pgimeno> NiLon: no, I'm pretty sure it's not about lack of alternation
[18:12:42] <pgimeno> I'm still looking just in case
[18:12:52] <NiLon> do you have like example of  it
[18:15:36] <NiLon> also regex has tons of flavors that not all support more advanced stuff
[18:15:51] <NiLon> so it could been just regex with limited feature set
[18:16:01] <pgimeno> no, sorry, I don't have an example. I think it's pretty much as if in pcre you use (?>...) everywhere.
[18:16:07] <NiLon> I honestly can't think anything like regex that isn't regex
[18:18:30] <digitok> sounds kinda like RE2, but that's probably not it
[18:18:40] <digitok> "RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++ library."
[18:20:04] <pgimeno> no, not the NFA kind
[18:20:37] <pgimeno> I'll let you know if I find it
[18:20:37] <NiLon> why does it matter tho?
[18:23:29] <pgimeno> I want to find the name, that's all
[18:24:21] <NiLon> I'm not asking because the reason matters at all, but it is alternative way of remembering the context and bringing it up
[18:25:13] <NiLon> we are super bad at remembering stuff directly but we remember feelings, sounds, locations etc. to it
[18:25:41] <pgimeno> yes, I remembered the bit about XML related to it :)
[18:25:56] <pgimeno> I can't find it there either, though
[18:34:15] <pgimeno> I think I've found it. Going to the Wikipedia instead of the standard for the DTD was a mistake. https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#determinism
[18:35:57] <pgimeno> apparently it's like a normal regular expression, with the additional constraint that it can be converted to a DFA without converting first from NFA to DFA
[18:39:47] <pgimeno> well, that gives me enough material to keep searching, thanks anyway!
[18:43:47] <pgimeno> yeah, 'Deterministic Regular Expression' brings up enough material. That was the name I was looking for. Thanks again!

[21:15:17] <twiclo> I need to find 'thing.thing' in a string. I've only ever written regexes under the assumption of what the first character I'm going to want to capture on is going to be but with this all I know is there will be a dot and I need the two words on either side of the dot

[21:34:26] <twiclo> I've been tinkering and here's what I've come up with
[21:34:28] <twiclo> [\w|-]*\.[\w|-]*
[21:34:50] <OnlineCop> So it must contain word characters OR hyphen, then dot, then more word-or-hyphen?
[21:34:56] <twiclo> (There are sometimes hyphens in the things I need to capture around the dot)
[21:34:58] <twiclo> Only problem is now I'm catchinge nd of sentences
[21:35:08] <OnlineCop> With the *'s in there, it means that it can also be 0-width on either side of the dot.
[21:35:18] <twiclo> An example thing I'm capturing: "bh-phal.rmed"
[21:35:32] <twiclo> Oh okay so what should I use instead?
[21:35:34] <digitok> ([\w-]+)\.([\w-]+)
[21:35:36] <OnlineCop> `\w+(?:-\w+)*\.\w+(?:-\w+)*`

[21:35:57] <OnlineCop> My version will avoid `-.-` from matching.
[21:36:12] <twiclo> What are the capturing groups in there for?
[21:36:23] <OnlineCop> But either mine or digitok's should work, if you know that the words around dots won't be "just hyphens".
[21:36:33] <OnlineCop> Those are grouping, but non-capturing, groups.
[21:36:51] <OnlineCop> So it will find "\w+" characters, and IF it finds a hyphen, it expects that it has more "\w+" after it.
[21:37:38] <OnlineCop> If there's no hyphen, or if there's word[hyphen]word[hyphen]word[...and so on...] then it will accept that group of "-\w+" as many times as it occurs.
[21:38:11] <twiclo> Okay thanks guys

[21:39:52] <OnlineCop> Or, were you asking about his capturing groups? Probably just so you could extract the "words-and-hyphens" in case you wanted to use them somewhere.
