[00:47:32] <GinFuyou> within form_valid you have to know where to take it.... in the form istelf, url, session.
[00:50:29] <Steve-Dusty> doesn't form_valid automatically submits?
[00:50:37] <Steve-Dusty> it automatically retursn a HTTPRESponse
[00:52:19] <GinFuyou> not sure what you mean. All views should return as subclass of a response, it's pretty much by definition of the view. form_valid is just a method inside so gCVBs
[00:53:43] *** Joins: djapo (~archangel@user/djapo)
[00:53:51] <Steve-Dusty> i still don't understand how to get "self" to reach student... autofill form.
[00:54:48] <GinFuyou> Not sure if you are confusing meanings or just terms
[00:56:00] <GinFuyou> changing form.instance in form valid should be referred as (auto)filling form.
[00:56:35] <GinFuyou> it's commonly used for front-end part
[00:56:56] <Steve-Dusty> yes I know that `form.instance.class_name =` will assign class_name to auto filling the form on submit
[00:57:03] <Steve-Dusty> but I can't get the object for it to submit
[00:57:05] <Steve-Dusty> class_name
[00:57:59] <GinFuyou> No, I'm saying your wording is completely off
[00:58:22] <GinFuyou> when in form_valid form is already have been submitted
[00:58:58] <GinFuyou> "auto-filling" there is also more confusing than anything
[00:59:48] <Steve-Dusty> when I say "auto-filling" i mean I don't want users to fill the "class" f-key for the student. It should fill it automatically depending on the class that the user clicked into
[00:59:58] <GinFuyou> You change form's (associated) object before saving (aka committing to DB)
[01:00:39] <Steve-Dusty> for example, there are 2 classes: math class, Science class. the user clicks into math class to add a student. without auto filling, they can choose which class to put the user into... but why? They already clicked into the science class
[01:00:58] <Steve-Dusty> math*
[01:01:32] <Steve-Dusty> ik but I don't know what to put on the other side of the equal sign
[01:01:35] <GinFuyou> auto-filling here would be adding class to the form, and presenting form to the user with this field already having value
[01:01:48] *** Quits: pyrrhus (~pyrrhus@user/pyrrhus) (Quit: pyrrhus)
[01:01:51] <GinFuyou> That's what I'd call "auto-filling"
[01:02:08] <GinFuyou> In django terms it would be "setting form initial (values)"
[01:03:01] <GinFuyou> Well, you have to let server (django) know which button user has clicked
[01:03:15] <GinFuyou> e.g. through corresponding url
[01:05:44] <Steve-Dusty> when you say that ^ it makes me think of this https://dpaste.org/yeNa
[01:05:56] <Steve-Dusty> yes, it's not not valid python code
[01:06:55] <GinFuyou> Pseudo-code is fine, but I don't see what you try to convey with it
[01:07:14] <Steve-Dusty> what's Pseudo-code?
[01:09:28] <GinFuyou> code to describe program or algorithm that looks like progeamming language, but not actually (correct) one, just something other programmer would understand
[01:11:44] <GinFuyou> namely when you can describe what you want to do algorithmically, but don't know how to do it with given language\tool
[01:12:16] <GinFuyou> For a start why are you set on that you need to refer self.get_queryset() ?
[01:12:59] <Steve-Dusty> idk just testing stuff out.
[01:13:44] <GinFuyou> too random, you should have at least a bit more understanding of what you are doing
[01:14:28] <GinFuyou> get_queryset() won't help you in this case, because you view model is Student, and get_queryset() supposed to return queryset of students
[01:14:40] <GinFuyou> and I'm not sure it even used in create view
[01:14:40] <Steve-Dusty> yes, that's what I discovered
[01:14:52] <Steve-Dusty> funky is probably going to get mad but this is what I mean https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48990344/setting-form-fields-in-django-class-based-generic-view-createview/48990533
[01:17:14] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/nLDJ
[01:17:29] <Steve-Dusty> I implemented his solution but I don't understand how self.kwargs would get class_name
[01:17:31] <Steve-Dusty> _id
[01:18:12] <GinFuyou> It would if it's provided in url pattern
[01:18:24] <GinFuyou> it's what kwargs in views usually are
[01:19:37] <GinFuyou>  /classes/42/students/add/ <- you can extract "42" which is class id with correct url pattern
[01:20:10] <GinFuyou> that's how django can know the class... but there are other options
[01:20:16] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/f837
[01:20:23] <Steve-Dusty> I don't really want to parse urls
[01:20:52] <GinFuyou> what do you mean?
[01:20:59] <GinFuyou> You are already doing it
[01:21:07] <Steve-Dusty> wut
[01:21:15] <Steve-Dusty> i meant getting request.get_absolute_url
[01:21:24] <Steve-Dusty> and parsing the /classes/42. the 42
[01:21:48] <GinFuyou> No, django already does it if you set the url pattern
[01:22:07] <GinFuyou> e.g. like /classes/<int:class_id>/students/
[01:22:37] <GinFuyou> it will parse integer value by name of "class_id" in the url
[01:22:43] <GinFuyou> when it matches
[01:22:55] <GinFuyou> and pass it to the view as kwarg
[01:23:22] <GinFuyou> function based view could be like my_view(request, class_id)
[01:23:36] <Steve-Dusty> oh, self.kwargs get the <int:pk>?
[01:23:38] <GinFuyou> CBVs just put everything in self.kwargs
[01:23:51] <GinFuyou> yes, for CBVs
[01:24:20] <Steve-Dusty> but my urls is just <int_pk>
[01:24:29] <Steve-Dusty> do you want me to `self.class-name-id`?
[01:24:51] <Steve-Dusty> self.kwargs['class-student-create'] *
[01:24:59] <GinFuyou> name is not relevant while it's valid
[01:25:26] <GinFuyou> It's just not fully clear from your code what pk it is
[01:25:55] <GinFuyou> so I used "class_id" in my example to make obvious
[01:26:04] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/SNuL here's my code for models

[03:29:00] <orzel> It usually involves a lot of input data (10k ?) and a very small png as output (200x50 in matomo typically). It seemed smarter to me to do that on backend.

[04:14:29] <zamba> i'm trying to make the migration against a postgresql database, mind you
[04:14:56] <GinFuyou> yes, clearly it's invalid value

[04:19:41] <zamba> so the problem is the default=True?
[04:20:29] <GinFuyou> Yes, it should be invalid value. Maybe sqlite is just more implicit in casting.
[04:20:37] <zamba> ah, but i see i removed that from the model later on.. can i just go ahead and then remove the migration altogether?
[04:20:55] <zamba> meaning, delete the migration file? or is there a better way of reverting that?
[04:21:03] <GinFuyou> Can't guarantee it was the source of your error, but from what you've provided...
[04:21:19] <zamba> delete the migration file and then remove the migrations.RemoveField() part from future migrations?
[04:22:10] <GinFuyou> if you starting db from scratch you could remove all migrations and run makemigrations again. If you don't have data migrations
[04:22:35] <GinFuyou> don't do it in any other case though

[04:36:51] <explore> i do want the important writes to also go to a rdbms
[04:37:09] <explore> but the idea was that the reddit engineer said that all reads never goes to the rdbms
[04:37:33] <GinFuyou> sounds like nonsense
[04:37:34] <explore> can redis be treated as a memcache or do devs have to learn both?
[04:38:53] <GinFuyou> but ofc you can push all kinds of cache to minimize db usage if it fits the requirements
[04:39:24] <explore> sorry what sounds like nonsense?
[04:40:51] <GinFuyou> writing to rdbms but never reading makes no sense. Could use /dev/null as DB then just fine. ^_^
[04:41:29] <explore> rdbms is the master store
[04:41:49] <explore> but rdbms doesn't do well if massive amount of hits go to it unnecessarily for reads
[04:42:00] <GinFuyou> it does
[04:42:04] <explore> you can have processes that pre-populate the cache upon reboot
[04:42:19] <explore> to make that prepopulation happen you need master data, which is stored in the rdbms
[04:42:35] <explore> so.. does that sound slightly less nonsense now?

[22:59:31] <Steve-Dusty> guys
[22:59:33] <Steve-Dusty> I need welpo
[22:59:48] <Steve-Dusty> I used bootstrap modal form in django. It returned a 405 error and did nothing. https://dpaste.org/kk1R A modal form wouldn't require another Django HTML page...I decided to set my template_name to the place where I want the modal form to appear, although there is another form set there already. Has anyone tried putting bootstrap5 modal forms in
[22:59:49] <Steve-Dusty> django?
[23:00:06] <Steve-Dusty> idk why it set a 405
[23:00:09] <Steve-Dusty> i made a POST request
[23:00:20] <Steve-Dusty> https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/ovlxyb/modal_form_in_django/h7c2kvn/?context=3
[23:05:43] <Steve-Dusty> I tried another way instead of including a FORM just a {% url %{
[23:05:44] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/o2GK
[23:06:01] <Steve-Dusty> but it only redirects to /dashboard/1 and doesn't delete anything
[23:07:13] <Steve-Dusty> looks like im making a GET instead of a POST
[23:12:01] <Steve-Dusty> WAIT IK WHY. it doesn't use template from modal :(
