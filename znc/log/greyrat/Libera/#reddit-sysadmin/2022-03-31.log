[00:37:01] <int0x1C8> a bands drummer leaves or gets sick on tour, they call in a well known studio drummer to fill in, typically they have to learn the set list in only a few days

[00:59:40] <bomb> lol
[00:59:47] <int0x1C8> affinity photo is $50 for a perpetual license
[00:59:49] <bomb> /mo part is problematic vinrock 
[00:59:58] <vinrock> hm
[01:00:10] <bomb> yeah, subscription is risky business
[01:00:15] <vinrock> i tried switching to gimp but its too unstable
[01:00:19] <PattyCakes> risky?
[01:00:20] <bomb> what if you were Russian? you're officially and legally fucked
[01:00:20] <vinrock> ive lost countless hous to crashes with it
[01:00:25] <PattyCakes> *industry laughs*
[01:00:51] <bomb> what if your credit card stops working because you forgot to pay kid support to your ex wife?
[01:00:56] <bomb> you're photoshop is gone
[01:01:16] <bomb> s/you're/your/
[01:01:16] <layer8> bomb meant: "your photoshop is gone"
[01:01:25] <PattyCakes> nobody is arguing against that point
[01:01:34] <PattyCakes> I'm just saying the industry laughs at your concerns
[01:01:38] <int0x1C8> we had 4 people using old perpetual licenses for adobe stuff, they got super pushy about switching to subscription
[01:01:59] <int0x1C8> then finally the old licenses just stopped working so instead of the near $1000/mo for adobe shit I found affinity
[01:02:00] <signofzeta> I don't have a problem with SaaSS, but then again, I don't use Adobe products to make money.  I use them for once-a-few-months stuff.  So, instead, I seek free alternatives.
[01:02:25] <bomb> > industry laughs
[01:02:36] <int0x1C8> I just wish there were something comparable in the CAD field
[01:02:47] <vinrock> what are you designing
[01:02:53] <int0x1C8> landscapes
[01:02:59] <vinrock> sketchup im a big fan of
[01:03:01] <signofzeta> Yeah, there's FreeCAD. I know it exists.  I assume it's laughable next to AutoCAD.
[01:03:02] <vinrock> super easy to learn
[01:03:05] <vinrock> i think it can outut p code
[01:03:15] <bomb> I should buy Rhinoceros 3D before it becomes subscription-based like Fusion 360
[01:03:33] <signofzeta> LibreOffice is a good-enough replacement for Microsoft Office, but I'm a light user who is willing to re-learn a few things.  I am not Joe Everyman.
[01:03:40] <int0x1C8> we're dependent on a CAD plugin that integrates our nursery item inventory and stock
[01:03:46] <signofzeta> (plus, worst case, my work computer has MS Office.)
[01:03:53] <bomb> int0x1C8 AutoCAD?
[01:04:07] <vinrock> didnt they up the device count on 365 licenses
[01:04:10] <vinrock> so you can now do 3
[01:04:16] <int0x1C8> so before, we had to license autocad and the plugin, called eaglepoint, then landcadd, now its keyscape
[01:04:19] <vinrock> used to be 2
[01:04:26] <signofzeta> M365 has been five devices for a while
[01:04:30] <vinrock> oh no shit
[01:04:32] <signofzeta> But they did up the price a little bit
[01:04:47] <bomb> I bought M361 for $10 from Ebay
[01:04:49] <Hunterkll> O365 has been five devices per user since I can remember, and that's going back to 2013 at least 
[01:04:57] <sd> 15<S​ubliminal Image> Fusion 360 might work for your tasks?
[01:04:58] <int0x1C8> now we license directly from keyscape, they bundled autocad into their product like OEM
[01:04:59] <signofzeta> Double-but, M365 Business Standard and higher got M365 Audio Conferencing (Teams POTS dial-in) for free as an apology
[01:05:06] <vinrock> i must be thinkin of something else then
[01:05:11] <int0x1C8> and I think we pay $41k a year for 9 seats
[01:05:18] <bomb> Subliminal Image wasn't Fusion 360 subscription-based as well?
[01:05:26] <sd> 15<S​ubliminal Image> It has free aspects of it
[01:05:41] <sd> 15<S​ubliminal Image> I use it for 3D printing modeling and home level is more or less free but has limitations
[01:05:43] <signofzeta> If you use SaaSS to make yourself money, then paying for it is a smart idea.  But if you're just a casual user, then it's not.
[01:06:01] <bomb> it's not about paying money we're talking though

[07:38:10] <sideup66> i know id be expected to work and thats fine, but going to work unless called just seems silly

[07:38:31] <xe0n> not go into the office and twiddle your fingers if\when you get a call
[07:38:44] <Cl0udNinja> I meant I'd be in the office for my normal day hours

[07:41:42] <sideup66> right so youd go in, work, then be avail after hours
[07:41:47] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[07:42:07] <xe0n> yeah... thats the idea of on call...not sit there and work\sit there waiting for a call
[07:42:12] <xe0n> it's "be avail if you get a call"
[07:48:08] <JollyRgrs> yeah, srsly, don't get sloshed and have phone always available
[07:48:08] <sideup66> in my job, normally right now, we dont work during the day in an oncall schedule....i know thats a bit of a luxury so im ok with being asked to work. ut if you are expected to get a call at night, you shouldnt be in
[07:48:10] <JollyRgrs> but live life
[07:48:36] <sideup66> in but then again in my role now we get called quite commonly at night. just the nature of our system
[07:48:52] <sideup66> maybe its alot more rare in other roles? im a l2 support
[07:48:52] <JollyRgrs> uh... is that nature "bad"?
[07:49:05] <JollyRgrs> what issues happen "all the time"?
[07:49:06] <sideup66> not always. we are trying to build up a lower team to try to take the front lines
[07:49:15] <Cl0udNinja> "the nature of an unstable and poorly written system"
[07:49:16] <sideup66> but have been struggling
[07:49:28] <JollyRgrs> is the company 24/7 operations?
[07:49:32] <xe0n> that's not on call then, that's working a night shift
[07:49:32] <xe0n> lol!
[07:49:35] <sideup66> yeah, were a bank
[07:49:40] <sideup66> im not hands on keyboard all night
[07:49:45] <xe0n> "oh i'm on call, aka night shift" which means...yeah dont work during the day
[07:49:49] <JollyRgrs> at the hospital, we had L1 helpdesk working all shifts, but only had to call in sysadmins if something really hit the fan
[07:50:04] <sideup66> yeah this new role is spinning it that way
[07:50:09] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: yeah, that's just night shift, lol
[07:50:26] <sideup66> overall i cant decide if its worht it. its the same job im doing now. more money. but would require me to move as they are a hybrid and want 3 days in office/week
[07:50:27] <JollyRgrs> so are the calls b/c servers are going down or just services crashing?
[07:50:31] <sideup66> right now im full remote since pandemic
[07:50:39] <sideup66> and dont seem to have plans to go back
[07:50:49] <JollyRgrs> 3 days in office, on-call means FULL STOP of life and changing to night shift?
[07:50:57] <JollyRgrs> how often do you have to pull night shift at this new place?
[07:51:21] <sideup66> they say about once per month. same as i do now with oncall. and the stupid low level stuff now like i said is handled by another team
[07:51:25] <xe0n> and how often do you get calls, if you're getting a large amount of calls outside of business hours (day hours, 8-5\6, whatever),then management needs to structure the department better
[07:51:26] <sideup66> they added them on shortly after i started
[07:51:34] <xe0n> on call is "be avail if someone needs assistance outside of business hours"
[07:51:41] <sideup66> when the lower level is strong, we only are called if shit hits the fan
[07:51:55] <xe0n> thats how it should be lol
[07:52:01] <JollyRgrs> either A) you need an actual night shift headcount and someone just works the night shift, or you need to just be on-call your week and work during the day
[07:53:14] <sideup66> right but either way
[07:53:50] <JollyRgrs> but either way, tbh, i'd not work that as it currently is
[07:53:58] <DrGibbysWifi> yeah
[07:54:04] <JollyRgrs> i don't want to work night shift and worse... wouldn't want to do like 3 weeks day and 1 week night
[07:54:10] <JollyRgrs> you'll never adjust to either one
[07:54:13] <sideup66> new job im saying
[07:54:15] <sideup66> wants me in
[07:54:21] <DrGibbysWifi> more like swing shift
[07:54:25] <sideup66> they say they dont get called much and theres a team overnight that takes stuff
[07:54:33] <sideup66> but can escalate up
[07:54:45] <sideup66> i guess i cant decide if im being moronic for getting bent over being asked to go in office
[07:55:06] <sideup66> when im perm remote now
[07:55:49] <Kiernian> No, everywhere I've worked had ridiculous in-office policies regarding on-call work. Basically their assumption was "the extra $thing you get for being on-call covers the inconvenience, we need you in the office like normal no matter what"
[07:56:13] <Kiernian> and no company I've been with has ever been able to see beyond "butts in seats" even with on-call
[07:56:26] <JollyRgrs> sideup66: that's a huge advantage (perm wfh)
[07:56:39] <JollyRgrs> you're not making a big deal outta nuthin
[07:56:46] <yuken> Haha, I just noticed that I can see my own lazy eye with my front camera.
[07:56:51] <yuken> Stare directly at it, ope my right eye is way off.
[07:57:08] <Kiernian> did you just say "ope"?
[07:57:24] <JollyRgrs> Kiernian: lol, any place i've done on-call was literally work your shift but you get the calls directed at you if SHTF and a sysadmin is needed
[07:57:38] <Kiernian> yeah, same thing JollyRgrs.
[07:57:45] <xe0n> sysadmins are escalation points, service desk should be the one taking the calls
[07:57:49] <Kiernian> although definitions of shit hitting the fan has differed
[07:57:54] <xe0n> and then they'll escalate if they can't resolve
[07:58:03] <JollyRgrs> anyone asking you to be present during on-call has undefined "on-call" and redefined it as "night shift"
[07:59:07] <Kiernian> right, whereas what I've continually proposed as healthy is, whatever we're "billing" on-call as per call in the ticket should be that much "flex time" at a BARE MINIMUM to be used against office hours the week you're on call
[07:59:53] <Kiernian> If I wake up at 3am and spent 15 minutes on something that bills as an hour, I should get an hour of flex time to take off of my regular office hours
[07:59:55] <xe0n> typically get a retainer for being on call (say $200 a week for discussion sake), that's just be to be ready if you get a call, and the plans you may have to re-arrange. if you get a call, it's standard hourly wage
[08:00:17] <xe0n> if you get no calls? cool couple of extra bucks in your pocket for nothing
[08:00:26] <sd> 10<n​emisys> You guys are getting paid to be on call?

[10:16:23] <sideup66> what would you folks do with the job thing im talking about, where you are offered same role, more $$, but have an in office requirement 3 days a week
[10:16:51] <sideup66> theres a little leeway but not much, as for oncall, its about once per month and youd be expected to be in office unless called during night which interview says is rare

[10:18:11] <DrZak> if you work from home all/most the time now, and they are giving you a better role now, i would stick with it
[10:18:24] <xe0n> not everything requires a x86 cpu with cores up the whazoo, plenty of uses for embedded stuff, or low power applications (and i dont mean in the software sense) haha
[10:18:28] <SirSceptalot> I don't think we can answer that for you. It depends too much on the mood in the office, how well you get along with them, how important wfh is for you etc

[10:19:05] <sideup66> DrZak: yeah wfh is nice...its a luxury ive grown used to...
[10:19:11] <kerat58> so you have w4h now
[10:19:16] <sideup66> yep
[10:19:22] <sideup66> new role would be 3 day a week hybrid
[10:19:23] <kerat58> so that's a downgrade
[10:19:23] <DrZak> i get so much shit done along with the work, while actually thinking about work doing it
[10:19:46] <sideup66> i hate to sound lazy but my current just pulls the office space of 20 minutes of actual work meme alot of times
[10:19:56] <sideup66> but yes its nice, i get shit done around the house too
[10:20:05] <sideup66> not big just dumb stuff, like laundry, etc...
[10:20:20] <kerat58> I mean if it's not a promotion / "advancement" then I'd factor in your commute expenses (including a reasonable value attached to what time you expect to spend commuting - your free time is worth money...) and see if the "extra money" is worth the pain in the ass factor

[10:20:25] *** Joins: tg (~tg@rockylinux/infra/tg)
[10:20:29] <sideup66> but i would be offered alot more money, about a 35k/yr raise
[10:20:39] <kerat58> ah well 3 grand a month lol
[10:20:39] <sideup66> from my current spot 45/min to an hour commute each way with toll
[10:20:53] <sideup66> the pay would be solid honestly
[10:20:57] <sideup66> but id have to move too
[10:21:09] <kerat58> then you have to factor in cost of living changes as well most likely
[10:21:11] <sideup66> and the real estate market is a complete meme, so my apartment would be around 2 grand a month right now if i were to
[10:21:14] <sideup66> current place is cheap lol
[10:21:22] <sideup66> plus whats sticking me is, its not even a higher rank
[10:21:45] <sideup66> same exact role i have now. im l2 now. and full remote. boss moved to another state lol so no, were not going back
[10:22:36] <kerat58> yeah I mean it sounds like you're taking on extra expense + extra pain in the ass.  45 minutes each way is an hour and a half daily; there'll be some fuel or transportation costs here too...
[10:22:43] <kerat58> TBH it sounds liek a lot of these things would eat into your $3k raise
[10:22:47] <kerat58> but that is just one man's opinion'
[10:23:04] <sideup66> yep, thats what im considering
[10:23:08] <sideup66> how much would it help career wise?
[10:23:10] <kerat58> here's what i'd do 
[10:23:12] <kerat58> if i were you
[10:23:26] <kerat58> take that hour and a half 3x+ a week that you were gonna spend commuting
[10:23:44] <kerat58> and dedicate it to learning a new skill to get qualified for whatever that job is that you want, but don't currently have
[10:23:51] <kerat58> and when ready, look for a non-lateral career move
[10:23:58] <sideup66> because i have been in current for about 4 years. its getting stale and a change is needed, but this wouldnt be a new rank (which id want)
[10:24:15] <kerat58> if the money is good in that other job, but it's a lateral role, you'll now have less incentive to move on / progress overall
[10:24:33] <kerat58> cuz that's what getting mroe money for doing the same shit causes 
[10:24:39] <kerat58> even if we say it wo'nt, that's what happens most of the time
[10:25:09] <kerat58> so think about it.  1.5 hours a day * 3 times a week = 4.5 hours per week in the car
[10:25:20] <sideup66> true. 
[10:25:28] <kerat58> what can you learn if you spend 5 hours a week on it?  That's a university level course a lot of times
[10:25:32] <kerat58> or a technical school course
[10:25:36] <kerat58> or you know what i mean
[10:25:55] <sideup66> plus the stinky fact of this, our current oncall system at my current role is, andeven pre pandemic was this way:

[10:35:34] <sideup66> ?
[10:36:05] <kerat58> if you can get someone in the company to mentor you a few hours a week because you want to improve your skills, you can start taking on some extra responsibility and eventually make a play for a formal promotion (when you are ready) or, start applying and interviewing for a full devops role once you have your skills set up to where interviewing is no longer a stumbling block
[10:37:41] <xe0n> finding a few hours in a job to help someone learn skills they could research and develop themselves is errr tricky sometimes... thats a few hours they then need to find to finish their own work

[10:38:33] <sideup66> whats catching me is that its linear
[10:38:44] <kerat58> xe0n:  Some companies have mentoring programs that compensate for this.  But yes, you have to be careful that your'e not "putting anyone out"
[10:38:57] <kerat58> that is why I asked if there were internal procedures...a lot of companies do, and they're smarter for it
[10:39:12] <kerat58> sideup66:  then line up some mock interviews

[10:40:56] <sideup66> yeah my boss is trying to find some stuff. i wonder if that should be my direction. regroup. figure out what it is id like to move into. then train and focus on that

[10:42:27] <sideup66> and early on i did vb.net though thats a dinosaur now
[10:42:35] <sideup66> might use it to maintain an old thing but nothing new built in it
[10:42:54] <kerat58> you probably have some solid foundations if you have experience in java and c#

[10:50:26] <kerat58> don't do indeed
[10:50:30] <kerat58> let me tell yo uwhy
[10:50:37] <kerat58> this is another One Man's opinion thing
[10:50:50] <Cl0udNinja> uhg I really cant believe i did that with my pills; I feel incredibly dumb
[10:51:03] <sideup66> pills here!
[10:51:21] <kerat58> but indeed, the cost to put up an ad is like ridiculously low....i've had to put up positions on Stackoverflow to fill open QA rolls, man, every time we do that the price goes up.  I thiunk our SO Bill is like $9500 a yaer now
[10:51:23] <Cl0udNinja> iirc I got my current and past job on indeed... 1 miss, 1 hit; so.. 50/50
[10:51:59] <Kiernian> they really messed up a great advertising option with that site. <Teal'C>Indeed.</Teal'C>
[10:52:05] <Cl0udNinja> also; TIL stackoverflow has a jobs area
[10:52:18] <kerat58> but shady / jerk around / waste of time positions are more prevelant on places that are cheaper
[10:52:29] <kerat58> "oh whatever Bill just throw up an ad, it's $50, we'll see what happens"

[10:54:32] <kerat58> Cl0udNinja last time I was hiring QA engineers, I had 2 spots open, ended up turning down several applicants who did interview, not because they did bad, but simply because someone else interviewed BETTER than they did, so when our recruitment team met up, we agreed on the 'better' performers
[10:54:34] <Cl0udNinja> and those shitty fucking psych tests and stupid 'test' shits where they call you with a robot to do some bullshit

[10:55:20] <kerat58> MULTIPLE people wrote back "Thank you for giving actual feedback instead of ghosting my ass"

[11:00:20] <sideup66> trying to salvage

[11:00:56] <sideup66> who is a rather large US bank
[11:00:57] <DrGibbysWifi> I've been able to nearly triple my income with a quick job search 
[11:01:10] <sideup66> so im surprised theyre doing all of this...normally in a palce like that youd think onto the next
[11:01:30] <Cl0udNinja> kerat58, hm thats not too terribly priced either
[11:01:56] <Cl0udNinja> oh its way more than just a scheduling thing tho :s
[11:01:57] <DrGibbysWifi> HR at new company had their shit together, obv
[11:02:07] <kerat58> Cl0udNinja:  what we do is when we pick someone for an interview we say "you've been selected for an interview.  Our interviews tend to take <LENGTH OF TIME>.  [If this is the first of two interviews, we say that there will be a 2nd round.]  We understand your time is valuable so we would like to set up a time for you and one of our managers to meet directly. During the interview we 
[11:02:07] <kerat58> will discuss [list here].  If you're still interested in our position, please book a time through [LINK].  We look forward to connecting soon"
[11:02:11] <sideup66> but to me and tell me if im wrong, isnt it a bad sign if a HR recruiter seems desperate?
[11:02:26] <sideup66> like why are they pushing to fill the role
[11:02:37] <kerat58> Cl0udNinja;  back when se used this, we used the scheduling thing only; we didn't need/use other services, and the price was fine even for only using that one part of it
[11:02:47] <Cl0udNinja> sideup66, it could be that the previous person left for some reason and no replacement available
[11:02:56] <DrGibbysWifi> lol
[11:03:00] <Cl0udNinja> or they're trying to handle an overworked set of people
[11:03:07] <DrGibbysWifi> if you can't hire within a day or two...
[11:03:13] <Cl0udNinja> kerat58, thanks I'm gonna see if my boss might be more interested
[11:03:18] <DrGibbysWifi> or at least give the interview
[11:03:22] <DrGibbysWifi> ya fucked
[11:03:27] <kerat58> sideup66:  depends on point of view.  If they have an immediate thing they need filled it means shit just hit the fan or they're really understaffed.  If you can handle the pressure/problems with a potentially difficult transition, then here's your chance to negotiate above market pay
[11:03:40] <Cl0udNinja> DrGibbysWifi, our interview process is a tad lengthy, but the longest part is however long it takes the candidate to do the code test
[11:03:49] <Cl0udNinja> afaik our turn around times on responses is no more than 48 hours
[11:03:54] <sideup66> theyre paying well above
[11:03:57] <sideup66> not super high
[11:04:00] <sideup66> but its a good number
[11:04:09] <DrGibbysWifi> Cl0udNinja: hope you're paying your applicants for their time
[11:04:24] <DrGibbysWifi> because if its "long", go fuck yourself
[11:04:36] <Cl0udNinja> DrGibbysWifi, we actually pay a $100 gift card if you go through the code test and are later not hired
[11:04:42] <DrGibbysWifi> FUCKING LOL

[11:05:06] <DrGibbysWifi> yeah, I'd HARD PASS

[11:06:03] <DrGibbysWifi> *my* personal time is well worth more than $100
[11:06:06] <kerat58> the gift card idea isn't a bad one; it says "look, we're not jerking people around, but we also can't just hire people blind"
[11:06:36] <Cl0udNinja> DrGibbysWifi, so you'd just pass totally on the off chance that you dont get hired and only get $100... smh
[11:06:43] <sideup66> kerat58: thats true on the immediate need
[11:06:52] <sideup66> but i feel like the push for in office is whats driving other folks away
[11:07:10] <Cl0udNinja> it might be more than $100, but I'm pretty sure its $100
[11:07:19] <kerat58> anyway, as for the scheduling software, we did that because we used to do email back and forth to 'set up a time', sometimes just doing THAT would take a full day or longer...and then the candidate later cancels, saying they got a job already
[11:07:30] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[11:07:38] <kerat58> so we tried to cut down the friction involved in setting up the interview itself, and in came the schedule idea
[11:07:39] <Cl0udNinja> I'm gonna recommend this to my boss and see what he thinks; might help him
[11:08:03] <DrGibbysWifi> Cl0udNinja: no? I'd pass on an offer that likely required me to prep for an hour long meeting with HR, then some silly task that you're *only* paying me $100 to do regardless of the experience or skill level to do
[11:08:33] <DrGibbysWifi> hence why people are switching jobs
[11:08:48] <kerat58> well what kind of work do you do now DrGibbysWifi, and how did the interview process go?  
[11:08:48] <kerat58> maybe we could learn something 
[11:08:48] <Cl0udNinja> there is no HR time; not that im aware of... its... apply, we send you the code test if we like your resume, and then you talk with humans
[11:09:08] <kerat58> hmm, the code test comes before the soft skills interview?
[11:09:22] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, we do the soft skills as a part of code review time
[11:09:23] <DrGibbysWifi> kerat58: I got a $15000 sign on bonus for just going through the interview process and accepting the job
[11:09:48] <Cl0udNinja> well sorry we dont work at fortune 500 companies gibby
[11:09:50] <sideup66> markets hot right now too
[11:09:55] <sideup66> im told no point taking something you arent happy with
[11:10:00] <DrGibbysWifi> interview process was about 30 mins, no bullshit, technical 
[11:10:10] <sideup66> ideally a devops role theres no reason it cant be full remote
[11:10:12] <sideup66> and pay well
[11:10:33] <DrGibbysWifi> Cl0udNinja: neither do I
[11:11:05] <kerat58> DrGibbysWifi:  Is it a technical role?  And what did they evaluate to determine you were the rgiht fit for what they need?  
[11:11:08] <kerat58> 30 minutes is pretty fast
[11:11:14] <kerat58> that's like almost speed dating 
[11:11:17] <kerat58> if that was the one and only interview
[11:11:20] <Cl0udNinja> yeah if anything I'd be weary of a short interview like that
[11:11:20] <sideup66> i guess thats why im debating this
[11:11:29] <sideup66> its good money
[11:11:33] <sideup66> but ties me to a place
[11:11:41] <sideup66> good question is, do they have an office elsewhere
[11:11:44] <Cl0udNinja> 30 minutes is barely enough time to get to understand wtf is up, let alone ask any questions or find red flags
[11:11:46] <sideup66> maybe i can take the job and just camp there
[11:11:48] <sideup66> where id want to go
[11:11:54] <DrGibbysWifi> extremely technical, I'm developing exploits for published/unpublished vulnerabilities

[11:12:17] <DrZak> :)))
[11:12:33] <kerat58> hmm, so I guess that the 30 minute interview was you making the ransom call, and the $15,000 signon bonus was their first payment?

[11:13:50] <DrGibbysWifi> sorry you're not looking, I guess?
[11:14:09] <Cl0udNinja> who reads backlog? thats for losers
[11:14:16] <Cl0udNinja> only show last 3 lines always
[11:14:56] <kerat58> exactly
[11:15:24] <DrZak> no, i meant that more generally, coz this management style of slashing costs has some pretty bizzare effects lately
[11:15:36] <DrZak> its not just they count with fines and penalties
[11:15:45] <kerat58> Well DrGibbysWifi the other thing is it sounds like you're in a very specialised role, so the hiring practices there might be different than some of the more general 'everyday' roles we're talking baout here
[11:15:56] <kerat58> i know there are industry pros who are so good they don't even really interivew, they just say "im' lookin' for work"
[11:16:07] <DrZak> now it seems a lot of people simply save money by not buying professionals, and when shit goes down they count with finding a new job
[11:16:11] <DrGibbysWifi> kerat58: I managed a SOC. 
[11:16:30] <DrGibbysWifi> I'm not hyper technical, but I'm a recovering red teamer
[11:17:19] <DrGibbysWifi> sysadmin is not different, yall just need a kick in the ass
[11:17:52] <DrGibbysWifi> pitter patter
[11:17:56] <DrGibbysWifi> have a good night
[11:18:12] <kerat58> i honestly have never seen a process where a sysadmin can be screened well in 30 minutes in a single round
[11:18:25] <DrGibbysWifi> they're not asking the right questions
[11:18:27] <kerat58> unless you already had a lot of background info about the candidate and were just confirming a few suspiciions
[11:18:47] <DrGibbysWifi> I could interview a technical security person, and within 5 mins I know if they're able
[11:19:08] <xe0n> if you interviewed me to drink beer with ya, you'd know within 10 seconds :)
[11:19:13] <SirSceptalot> I'm not even applying and you're already making me sweat DrGibbysWifi 
[11:19:14] <xe0n> 🍻

[11:19:56] <DrZak> :D
[11:20:12] <DrGibbysWifi> have you had aussie beer?
[11:20:42] <DrGibbysWifi> No? then sit the fuck down. Fucks sake
[11:20:59] <DrZak> i had 'Victoria bitter', apparently the 2nd most popular one
[11:21:04] <DrGibbysWifi> and dont say fosters. I'll fuckin cut ya
[11:21:12] <SirSceptalot> man gibby's on fire today
[11:21:16] <kerat58> xe0n:  "know within 10 seconds" that's the spirit 
[11:21:18] <DrZak> it was a bit, odd
[11:21:19] <DrGibbysWifi> I aint taking no shit
[11:21:33] <DrGibbysWifi> tired of this discordian bullshit
[11:21:41] <kerat58> DrGibbysWifi will know within 5 minutes if they're able.  and if those expert skills don't do the job, his uplifting and positive attitude will help seal the deal
[11:21:43] <kerat58> I can tell already
[11:23:14] <DrZak> i have learned that particular beer is also called ‘Vomit Bomb’

The typical "prove to me you're smart" attitude nerds have doesn't work well within an interview. Questions should be designed to allow the candidate to elaborate on the technical detail. And the person asking them should understand the detail needed to have followup questions.

[12:12:52] <lancehead> Good morning fellas, fellaettes and often forgotten (but not by me) IT manager that told me "gimme one minute" in response to a question and has been silent for the past ten
[12:12:56] <lancehead> And SirSceptalot
[12:13:52] <SirSceptalot> morning lancehead 
[12:14:37] <lancehead> What up 
[12:15:11] <kerat58> a "beef bus"
[12:15:12] <kerat58> LOL
[12:15:12] <SirSceptalot> wondering why they made USB-C, which is awesome, so horrible
[12:16:32] <Hunterkll> it's just a connector standard....
[12:16:47] <lancehead> What's horrible about it?
[12:17:26] <kerat58> public buildings were only just starting to have USB-A support in their outlets
[12:17:27] <SirSceptalot> different cables being able to do different things while looking identical and having no markings as to their capabilities
[12:17:30] <kerat58> and now this!  Man, what a drag
[12:17:47] <Hunterkll> hm?
[12:18:00] <Hunterkll> some USB rated cables can do thunderbolt, but thunderbolt rated cables have thunderbolt icons on them
[12:18:04] <Hunterkll> that's about it....
[12:18:40] <lancehead> Ah I see what you mean 
[12:18:54] <lancehead> Hunterkll: Some shitty chinese ones don't do data transfer, only charging, and don't mark it 
[12:18:59] <lancehead> I guess is what Scept is referring to 
[12:19:03] <Hunterkll> don't buy shitty cables?
[12:19:04] <DrZak> :)
[12:19:10] <lancehead> I mean, fair 
[12:19:17] <DrZak> i love those chinese crappy products
[12:19:25] <DrZak> where they have an sd card inside the usb key
[12:19:29] <DrZak> or just a resistor
[12:19:30] <DrZak> :DDD
[12:19:50] <SirSceptalot> well, I spent quite some time setting up laptop + docking monitor with passthrough, had all kinds of issues with display
[12:20:01] <kerat58> how about the drives that are marketed as 1tb but are actually 256gb and have foolery in there that will crash when you try to write moer than 256gb to it
[12:20:13] <DrZak> :))
[12:20:13] <lancehead> On another note: does anyone else NEVER open the Google Photos "look back at <date>" things, out of fear of it being a nude?
[12:20:17] <Hunterkll> don't buy $5 1TB drives?
[12:20:24] <kerat58> lancehead:  every single time
[12:20:28] <SirSceptalot> USB cable did ethernet and charging just fine, did video between the monitor and primary display just fine
[12:20:33] <SirSceptalot> just the passthrough would give issues
[12:20:45] <SirSceptalot> eventually solved it with a different USB-C cable
[12:20:50] <Hunterkll> sure it wasn't actually thunderbolt and you weren't using a TB rated cable?
[12:21:06] <SirSceptalot> I solved it with a different non-TB marked cable
[12:21:19] <Hunterkll> like i said <Hunterkll> some USB rated cables can do thunderbolt, but thunderbolt rated cables have thunderbolt icons on them
[12:21:25] <SirSceptalot> also, the laptop doesn't claim thunderbolt
[12:21:30] <Hunterkll> eh
[12:21:36] <Hunterkll> might be trying to do 3.1 gen 2 or something 
[12:21:38] <SirSceptalot> nor does the monitor dock for that matter
[12:21:41] <Hunterkll> and your cable was made before then
[12:21:47] <Hunterkll> but USB docks in general are fucking retarded
[12:21:49] <Hunterkll> i refuse to use them
[12:21:53] <Hunterkll> got 3 thunderbolt ones though :D
[12:22:29] <Hunterkll> kerat58: so did you get the job at the firm?
[12:22:31] <Hunterkll> :D
[12:23:17] <SirSceptalot> it's this monitor (quickspec sheet) https://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c06489910

[13:06:41] <Hunterkll> :D
[13:06:48] <Hunterkll> was like $600 
[13:06:55] <Hunterkll> so something's driving shit insane
[13:06:55] <Hunterkll> hahah
[13:07:05] <Hunterkll> time to downgrade driver - again
[13:07:51] <yuken> Hunterkll, you got a 7980XE and like... dual GPU though!
[13:07:52] <yuken> right?
[13:08:11] <Hunterkll> well yea
[13:08:16] <Hunterkll> and routinely thrash my 1KW PSU

[13:50:59] <haise01> RIP lol
[13:51:00] <Hunterkll> meanwhile FFXV i have to *force* into SLI to get the performance i want
[13:51:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:51:20] <haise01> ha
[13:51:29] <haise01> I wonder if they will fix it with 7.0 since they are poking graphics with that update
[13:51:44] <yuken> Hunterkll, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE0vl06ZWQI
[13:51:51] <Hunterkll> haise01: if they haven't fixed it in 7+ years.....
[13:52:06] <Hunterkll> and SLI proper is on its way out for multi-gpu based API support....
[13:52:17] <haise01> fair enough then
[13:52:18] <haise01> lol
[13:52:37] <Hunterkll> I mean, to get SLI and sli-like functionality now, your option is two 3090's 
[13:52:40] <Hunterkll> and that's it
[13:52:41] <Hunterkll> :D
[13:52:44] <Hunterkll> with nvlink
[13:52:58] <Hunterkll> though it's kinda cool because you can pool both GPUs ram together and just use a single GPU engine for rendering to have a bonkers amount of GPU ram
[13:53:14] <haise01> that is fucking awesome
[13:53:18] <Hunterkll> i was planning on getting two 3090s but you know how that goes
[13:53:26] <haise01> yeah lol
[13:53:30] <haise01> I wanted to get single RTX 3080

[14:13:44] <Hunterkll> yea but seeing 400fps is hilarious
[14:13:56] <haise01> you are getting that much ?!
[14:14:07] <haise01> jfc, when I remove cap, I am around 140-150
[14:14:12] <Hunterkll> whew
[14:14:16] <Hunterkll> fuckin that was fucked
[14:14:29] <Hunterkll> but now stuff is tiny on my monitor outside of the game LOL
[14:14:36] <haise01> ouch
[14:14:38] <Hunterkll> but at least i only have to change scaling while the game's open
[14:14:46] <Hunterkll> .... so i might as well just leave it till the next build upgrade
[14:14:47] <Hunterkll> :D
[14:14:54] <haise01> lol
[14:15:00] <Hunterkll> haise01: yea, 100% DPI scaling on a 55" display, soooooo tiny
[14:15:09] <Hunterkll> why its' almost normal sized like my 24" 1080p monitor!
[14:15:43] <haise01> I cannot stand 100 on large displays
[14:15:58] <Hunterkll> DPI scaling is meant for small displays
[14:16:02] <Hunterkll> larger the display, lower the scaling factor
[14:16:39] <Hunterkll> and yes, by 'soooo tiny' i mean everything's normal sized like before display scaling was a thing

[15:13:14] <thegodsquirrel> Now that's a segue  
[15:14:54] <SirSceptalot> does anyone happen to remember an old worms-like game, played on a circular 3D field with small stationary tanks? The tanks usually said a dumb quote when firing, such as "your shoelaces are united" or "remember the alamo"
[15:15:13] <SirSceptalot> far stretch that anyone would know what game I'm talking about, but what the hell
[15:15:48] <Oliber> oh man, worms was one hell of a game
[15:16:11] <DrZak> yea worms!
[15:16:19] <DrZak> bit this is probably smething else
[15:16:31] <DrZak> worms werent on anything circular
[15:16:49] <SirSceptalot> yeah, it wasn't worm. I wouldn't call it "a worms-like game" otherwise :p
[15:17:43] <SirSceptalot> not important, but that "your shoelaces are united" quote popped in my head when they came undone earlier, and now I'm trying to remember that game
[15:18:09] <SirSceptalot> you could choose to fire tracers are various kinds of bombs, the biggest ones were little boy and fat man

[16:50:46] <Hunterkll> but this one had 64GB, good enough to start out with

[23:33:06] <PublicWiFi> yeah that
[23:33:13] <PublicWiFi> he had a ton of nitrites wit hno nitrates
[23:33:13] <shakygator> a system is cycled once the ammonia can be converted to nitrates in 24h, etc
[23:33:21] <shakygator> yeah his cycle wasnt done
[23:33:29] <PublicWiFi> after the lake water was added it fixed that
[23:33:31] <PublicWiFi> pretty neat
[23:33:35] <bomb> wait, are we talking about poop?
[23:33:36] <shakygator> well it probably was just time
[23:33:50] <shakygator> if nitrites existed that means there was bac, just not the right kind...yet
[23:34:05] <PublicWiFi> he just gave it a boost
[23:34:13] <shakygator> i mean you need that kind, but you need a 2nd too, but it doesnt show up until you actually have nitrites
[23:34:17] <shakygator> ye i know :)
[23:34:24] <PublicWiFi> its neat shit
[23:34:28] <PublicWiFi> xD
[23:34:42] <shakygator> if you have a really effective biofilter you can gas off nitrogen in the 4th step (and reduce nitrates)
[23:34:50] <shakygator> but that requires anoxic zones
[23:35:28] <PublicWiFi> little involved for some backyard redneckin
[23:35:49] <technonerd> nitrogen cycle how does it work!

[23:35:59] <Hunterkll> dicks
[23:36:03] <Hunterkll> that's how
[23:36:20] <PublicWiFi> Dick Nitrogen Series
[23:36:22] <PublicWiFi> its always DNS
[23:36:51] <PublicWiFi> i wanna know how you avoid root rot shakygator 
[23:37:10] <PublicWiFi> a lot of plants don't like their roots being wet 24/7, but in a aquaponic solution you'd end up having the water moving 24/7 right?
[23:37:17] <shakygator> its just certain plants i guess
[23:37:21] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[23:37:27] <Hunterkll> and some systems just mist occasionally 
[23:37:28] <shakygator> not everything can grow in water, or can be considered marginal
[23:37:31] <Hunterkll> instead of submerging
[23:37:33] <PublicWiFi> or maybe you could have a timer on a section of plants who don't like being wet too much
[23:38:10] <shakygator> well so im doing a deep water culture, which is just water with air bubbles, but there are systems that flood/drain
[23:38:33] <shakygator> which i will do on my aquaponic system with a bell style drain
[23:38:39] <shakygator> fills up, creates siphon, drains. repeat
[23:38:47] <shakygator> creates an oxygen rich env for the roots
[23:38:48] <PublicWiFi> makes me want to try it for fun
[23:38:57] <PublicWiFi> but the upfrotn costs are a bit steep lol
[23:39:05] <PublicWiFi> bonus points if you run it off solar power too xD
[23:39:06] <shakygator> this DWC is just a $30 kit on amazon. you can buy all the stuff separate but this was easier for now
[23:39:16] <shakygator> at new property i will have my greenhouses with solar
[23:39:19] <shakygator> and geothermal
[23:39:39] <PublicWiFi> oh nice
[23:40:52] <PublicWiFi> geothermal as in having a geothermal system via a compressor? or steady air blown through some pies from the ground?
[23:41:07] <PublicWiFi> pipes*
[23:41:31] <shakygator> i wanna do the pipes underground
[23:41:34] <PublicWiFi> wonder how warm it would stay in the winter time if you're just using the air pipes circulated in the ground
[23:41:37] <shakygator> but i need to learn much more about it
[23:41:47] <PublicWiFi> yeah I've heard about that, seems like a neat idea
[23:41:48] <shakygator> supposedly the ground stays a steady temp
[23:41:51] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[23:42:18] <shakygator> so in theory if its effective you keep the greenhouse with 65* air no matter the season
[23:42:27] <PublicWiFi> yeah that would be amazing
[23:42:28] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:42:35] <PublicWiFi> and the power needed to pump that air would be relatively minimal
[23:42:36] <shakygator> so if i can couple that with solar
[23:43:03] <shakygator> id be running water pumps at this case. and i have a much bigger greenhouse planned for aquatic life....same principal though (im sure ill have split units for backup)
[23:43:14] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[23:44:05] <PublicWiFi> i've heard of some systems actually "pumping" excess heat in the grond during the day and pumping it back out at night
[23:44:09] <PublicWiFi> in the winter time
[23:44:22] <PublicWiFi> since the greenhouses can get warm in direct sunlight even in winter
[23:44:31] <PublicWiFi> idk how well that works though
[23:45:01] <PublicWiFi> i think they use 2 thermostats, reversing the airflow

[23:45:28] <PublicWiFi> or some shit idk xD

[23:46:00] <Hunterkll> >:3
[23:46:09] <PublicWiFi> :3
[23:46:18] <PublicWiFi> oh its called a GAHT system
[23:46:53] <bomb> we don't actually need new tech in greenhouses, but "agriculture entrepreneurs" are pushing lots of dumb shit lately

[23:58:39] <PublicWiFi> shakygator: do you think youll collect rain water for the greenhouse?
[23:58:42] <PublicWiFi> or use well water?
[23:58:46] <PublicWiFi> or both xD
