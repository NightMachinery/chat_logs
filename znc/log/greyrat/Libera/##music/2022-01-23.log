[00:25:17] <murthy> I fear talking about it, so lets not talk about it
[00:25:46] <murthy> The angle in which you blow the flute matters to create the sound
[00:26:24] <murthy> I thought I could use a leaf blower with nozzle attachment to blow the flute

[00:33:13] <murthy> tell me how to find it and I will find it

[21:10:44] <artao> me too!! tho elementary school

[21:12:22] <Panther> The review found universal shortcomings in study design, leading the researchers to write that they “failed to find convincing evidence in support of any mobile phone-based intervention on any outcome.”

[21:12:45] <murthy> Like we're is cornao

[21:13:16] <Panther> It’s a provocative claim that hints at the work ahead for an industry garnering billions of dollars in investment to develop products that can help people more easily manage health conditions from their phones. Researchers and entrepreneurs are hoping to collect enough evidence to prove to health care policymakers and the public that their interventions work.
