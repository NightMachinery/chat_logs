[00:00:21] <superkuh> If only the interface were designed in some powerful scripting language, like XUL, and you could just install an extension to change it...
[00:01:51] <superkuh> But that'd be silly. We have to make sure the ignorant can't hurt themselves and that DRM stay's DRM'd.
[00:02:01] <superkuh> stays.

[01:37:29] <evilgohan2> [15:52:20] <Snuupy> they also have ass UI for profile switching
[01:37:38] <evilgohan2> It used to be much better... before they killed off XUL
[01:37:43] <evilgohan2> so what I did was install Firefox Dev.
[01:37:55] <evilgohan2> Profile 1: Firefox Main. Profile 2: Firefox Dev. I'm good.
[01:38:23] <Snuupy> ah I need many more profiles than that
[01:38:37] <Snuupy> main, dev, shopping, family members when I need to help them with shit, etc
[01:38:44] <Snuupy> 1 for testing out extensions
[01:41:49] <evilgohan2> I used to do one for testing out extensions, with aggressive use of FoxyProxy as well, but not so much these days.
[01:41:59] <evilgohan2> For shopping, have you considered Firefox Containers?

[01:42:40] <evilgohan2> https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers#readme <-- it's been in Dev for a while, but made its way to Firefox Main a few versions back.
[01:44:59] <evilgohan2> Actually, on that note, have you ever looked at this Snuupy? It looks like a newer version of the old XUL Profile Switcher: https://github.com/null-dev/firefox-profile-switcher
[01:45:16] <Snuupy> I don't like containers
[01:45:19] <Snuupy> I want different sets of extensions
[01:45:36] <evilgohan2> Got ya. The profile switcher might work for you ^
[01:45:51] <Snuupy> ooh
[01:46:10] <Snuupy> still missing site specific browsers (SSB) though
[01:46:32] <evilgohan2> True, but I don't recall that ever being a feature tbh.
[01:48:51] <Snuupy> it was, it was removed
[01:49:31] <evilgohan2> oh interesting
[01:49:31] <Snuupy> chrome calls it just "adding to home" or "installing app"
[01:49:53] <evilgohan2> truth be told, there have been features firefox has had over the years that were awesome but got removed
[01:50:01] <evilgohan2> and I don't know why :(
[01:50:01] <Snuupy> then they pulled that mr robot shit
[01:50:05] <Snuupy> and pocket is fuckin dumb
[01:50:45] <evilgohan2> I disable Pocket every single time.
[01:50:57] <Snuupy> pain in the ass
[01:51:04] <Snuupy> just use librewolf lul
[01:51:04] <evilgohan2> agreed.
[01:51:56] <Snuupy> I'd like to be on a gecko renderer but ff dumb
[01:52:09] <Snuupy> I don't think librewolf sync works yet
[01:52:17] <Snuupy> it's all compromises
[01:54:02] <evilgohan2> Firefox is nice on Android though - having NoScript and UBlock Origin work there :)
[01:54:13] <evilgohan2> too bad I can't use it properly on my iPad because... Apple.

[19:27:39] <skye0> I will be eligible for the vaccine as soon as possible, gonna have to arrange one on Friday if they know I'm applying for an NHS job
[19:27:57] <Allie> i get stabbed on thursday
[19:28:06] <Allie> probably gonna be AZ or moderna, because that's what the EICC has right now
[19:28:41] <skye0> moderna i've heard is slightly more prone to side effects than pfizer. i hear my parents got pfizer, i may be eligible for pfizer or other vaccines
[19:28:56] <skye0> would love the j&j vaccine but it's more prioritized for like the homeless who may not be able to reliably get a second shot
