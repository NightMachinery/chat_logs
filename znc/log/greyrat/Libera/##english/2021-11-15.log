[16:06:02] <Me-me> Yes, I believe that is a valid use of a semicolon. They take the place of conjunctions. One such abbreviation could fit in that place, I believe.
[16:06:15] <brandoneliza> lol it says semicolons are used in a place of a conjunction but here its not that
[16:06:37] <Me-me> Like I said - a mess.
[16:06:52] <brandoneliza> so would an ellipsis or a em dash fit better
[16:06:54] <Me-me> "No-one accepts the challenge except one, and one you would least expect." That works.
[16:07:01] <Me-me> So logically, so should a semicolon.
[16:07:29] <Me-me> If not a semicolon, then a comma.
[16:07:35] <brandoneliza>  "No-one accepts the challenge except one, the one you would least expect."
[16:07:46] <brandoneliza> would a semicolon work ^^ too
[16:07:57] <Me-me> Possibly. It's hard to say.

[16:27:24] <darsie> You don't usually start a sentence wiht a  .
[16:33:57] <FLHerne> brandoneliza: I'd use an em dash

[16:36:05] <tinsoldier> em dash — Noun: 1. (typography) The symbol (—) (used to demarcate a parenthetical thought or to indicate a break, or for emphasis) https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/em_dash
[16:36:10] <FLHerne> basuotoko: "...will be a/the snooker competition"
[16:36:56] <FLHerne> Technically there will also be snooker competition, as in the concept of players being competitive about snooker, but no-one would say or write that
[16:37:14] <FLHerne> "10 minutes later" is right :-)

[20:33:40] <bin> placeb0: my personal opinion is "no", you cannot turn a window on or off, but as blkshp said it would depend on interpretation (and also maybe dialect)
[20:33:56] <placeb0> bin: THANK YOU 
[20:34:33] <bin> placeb0: also do you mean a window like in a building or on a computer as in a program window?
[20:35:05] <bin> I think that matters too. One could argue that you can turn on/off a computer window, but building windows would not be on/off unless they received power in some way. e.g. an automatic tint powered by electricity
[20:35:10] <bin> "Did you turn the window on?" would mean 
[20:35:17] <bin> "did you turn the window tint on?"
[20:35:18] <blkshp> ok, it's a very loose interpretation. Website has a fault "turn if off and on again"

[21:06:34] <bin> this is not a shower stall
[21:06:43] <bin> it's a full tub with a shower
[21:07:01] <bin> so you can get out from the water and take a drink while still being in the tub
[21:07:14] <tinwhiskers> ah
[21:07:20] <blkshp> Ah, so still lying down though, I'm confused!
[21:07:25] <bin> no, standing up
[21:07:36] <bin> you just stand in the tub
[21:07:38] <blkshp> Oh, i have walk in double width one
[21:07:41] <blkshp> no tub
[21:07:49] <bin> ahh
[21:08:11] <bin> yeah in the US this is a very common setup, tub + shower in one so you can have one device for bother actions
[21:08:26] <bin> like youve seen the movie "Psycho" right?
[21:08:31] * LuisP14 looks a turn window on/off and thinks of "disable window"

[21:08:50] <chat> bin meant to say: yeah in the US this is a very common setup, tub + shower in one so you can have one device for both actions
[21:12:02] <LuisP14> (computer-wise)
[21:24:50] <bin> LuisP14: yeah
[21:25:00] <bin> I can def see disable being used, but with a different meaning

[21:30:48] <blkshp> A tin of beer! 
[21:31:36] <kurahaupo> or a dinghy 
[21:31:44] <blkshp> Really?!
[21:32:01] <kurahaupo> specially a metal dinghy
[21:32:36] <kurahaupo> but that's a Kiwi thing not an Aussie thing
[21:33:04] <kurahaupo> "tin" meaning metal generically
[21:33:47] *** Joins: fweht (uid404746@lymington.irccloud.com)
[21:34:29] <kurahaupo> a "tin can" is usually steel; some "tin foil" is usually aluminium
[21:36:14] <kurahaupo> "tin bum" or "tin arse" means the speaker is envious of the referent's good luck.
[21:37:06] <blkshp> what about tinwhiskers what does tin whiskers mean :P
[21:37:22] <LuisP14> hehe
[21:37:35] <tinwhiskers> tinny is a foil of dope
[21:37:53] <blkshp> But what is dope to you
[21:37:59] <tinwhiskers> pot
[21:38:11] <kurahaupo> I have to admit that when I read "shower beer", I just assumed it was a quirky way of writing "beer shower"
[21:38:20] <tinwhiskers> also a boat, as kurahaupo said
[21:38:28] <blkshp> Ah, we don't have foils of cannabis here
[21:38:47] <blkshp> It always comes in little plastic baggies
[21:38:50] <tinwhiskers> no tinny houses? omg.
[21:39:06] <LuisP14> quite dope
[21:39:10] * LuisP14 runs
[21:39:30] <blkshp> a "foil wrap" would usually be for far harder drugs, usually those that you heat and inject with a spoon
[21:39:35] <blkshp> Wait...
[21:39:49] <tinwhiskers> yeah, makes more sense
[21:39:54] <kurahaupo> blkshp: Very old objects made of actual tin may undergo a phase shift from metalic to crystalline. The crystals typically form as thin "whiskers" on the surface
[21:39:57] <blkshp> Actually no i like the idea that you inject with a spoon and i shall not correct the sentence! :D
[21:39:57] <LuisP14> lol inject ...spoon
[21:40:23] <kurahaupo> it's a very sharp spoon
[21:41:29] <blkshp> You know the McDonalds mcflurry stirry spoons, they have a hole in there, I could make a fortune here. Spoon with a bowl and a hole that moved liquid (soup, of course) into an injector in the handle xD! lol
[21:42:21] <tinwhiskers> druggies just aren't investing sufficiently in R&D
[21:42:28] <blkshp> lmfao

[21:43:29] <huf> sure they are
[21:43:39] <kurahaupo> Regular hypodermic needles are too thin to pass a 5G tracking chip, so COVID-19 inoculations have to use hypodermic spoons instead
[21:43:50] <tinwhiskers> heh
[21:43:58] <LuisP14> their heads in the clouds, so of course not :>
[21:44:03] <huf> they're living in a single room with 3 other individuals
