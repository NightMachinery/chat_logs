[03:15:27] <alex88> Hi everyone, I'm using a yubikey to sign git commits and that's working properly, however when I try to push/pull from azure devops repos, I get a prompt for the key pin, how do I know why is that happening? I don't remember setting anything about it and it only happens on one of my laptops
[03:17:43] <cbreak> alex88: I use a yubikey via gpg-agent masquerading as ssh-agent for ssh login / git
[03:18:57] <alex88> cbreak, where is that configured? I remember only setting gpgsign=true and the signingkey in my gitconfig but it shouldn't apply to git pull/push
[03:20:05] <cbreak> check your SSH_AUTH_SOCK env var. Is it something like /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh?
[03:20:26] <alex88> oh, it is, let me check what sets that
[03:20:46] <cbreak> alex88: I like using yubikeys for ssh
[03:20:56] <cbreak> that's basically the main reason I use them
[03:21:19] <cbreak> if you upload a gpg key to them and use them in smart-card mode, you can do the same
[03:21:53] <cbreak> you can get your ssh public key (matching to the gpg private key on the yubikey) with ssh-add -L
[03:22:29] <alex88> I only use it to login into my account and sign gpg commits (and on websites that supports it), setting up the certs for git signing was so painful that I don't want to play with it again for ssh until they expire
[03:22:31] <cbreak> and when you put that into `.ssh/authorized_keys` or register it on a git server, you can log in securely that way too
[03:23:25] <cbreak> you shouldn't need to change anything on the key
[03:24:25] <alex88> oh I see it, well it seems the gpg-agent zsh plugin si setting up the env variable.
[03:24:30] <alex88> does the yubikey store the public key too?
[03:24:45] <alex88> I remember having to extract that from my backup files when I had to use it in gpg signing
[03:26:34] <alex88> well, thanks a lot for pointing at SSH_AUTH_SOCK cbreak!

[17:26:29] <pflanze> Re feasible way: I'm kind of hoping for a more fuzzy tool, like looking at sub-expressions and searching them in master, or the ancestors of master around the few days after the commit in question, and building a score of how many it finds applied.
[17:26:59] <pflanze> I just want a "heat map" of possibly forgotten work in my repo.
[17:27:19] <osse> how many tags are we talking about?
[17:27:49] <pflanze> Hundreds, after accumulation over a couple years, per repo?
[17:28:27] <pflanze> Probably it's just *dozens* of tags with forgotten work, though, if even.
[17:28:29] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[17:29:21] <pflanze> The reason I'd love a tool is mostly because I often find myself thinking, "Didn't I start doing this", but then I hate to wade through dozens and dozens of tags to see whether I can find it.

[17:31:04] <osse> i don't know of the kind of tool you want
[17:31:36] <osse> I suspect looking over  git log -p --tags --no-walk  will be faster than writing it :p

[17:36:26] <pflanze> Ok. On a related question, what language would you most recommend to write such tools, nowadays? I've written them in Perl till now (and I'm writing FunctionalPerl which helps doing this), but I wonder if Haskell would be a good place to look, or Rust now (wondering if not too painful). A functional language should be a good fit, so preferably not Python or Go?
[17:37:50] <ikke> neither python, nor go are considered functional languages
[17:38:20] <pflanze> Yes that's what I meant.
[17:38:31] <ikke> ah, I missed the 'not'
[17:39:09] <ikke> git filter-repository was written in python
[17:39:55] <osse> A language that makes it easy to invoke external commands and that has a decent implementation of a map/dict, because you're gonna need that I am guessing
[17:41:21] <osse> I don't really have the ability to tell whether a language is a good or a bad fit for a certain task.
[17:41:41] <osse> I usually pick the language I am most proficient in if I need to get it done, or the language I want to learn more about otherwise

[20:20:44] <mokulus> I mean display the history in a clean matter.
[20:21:30] <osse> technically you can still do the merge and the maintainer can fastforward
[20:21:38] <mokulus> Similarily I don't understand why it's useful to squash commits. This option only shows me merge commits.
[20:21:58] <mokulus> The --first-parent option.
[20:22:28] <osse> squashing makes sense if you several commits do part of the work

[20:24:42] <osse> that reduces the whole feature branch into one large commit. and honestly, I don't understand that either
[20:25:21] <osse> i'd much rather make my feature branch pretty, and if that means that it boils down to just one commit in the end anyway then that's fine

[20:45:09] <jast> people typically prefer squashing if commit hygiene in the topic branch is bad
[20:45:40] <mokulus> But with '--first-parent' the graph looks the same, line, the differnce is between squash commit and merge commit.
[20:45:47] <jast> i.e. if it's a maze of "add some part of the code" "fix bug" "fix bug 2" "redo the first commit a little differently" "add some more impl" "fix half of the failing tests" etc.

[23:24:35] <Kill-Animals> I'm playing around with `git commit -v` but when I save and quit, it `Aborting commit due to empty commit message.` even though I thought I put something in

[23:25:41] <ikke> Where did you put your commit message?
[23:26:21] <Kill-Animals> ikke: Under the # but on their own lines, near the diff
[23:26:29] <ikke> Put it at the top
[23:26:50] <Kill-Animals> ikke: it works when I put it on the first line. I don't get why though, when this is usually not the case with `git commit -a`
[23:27:08] <ikke> Kill-Animals: https://tpaste.us/prvg
[23:27:41] <ikke> It's part of the output
[23:27:43] <Kill-Animals> ikke: I feel dumb. Thanks
[23:28:41] * Kill-Animals continues through the tutorial
[23:29:09] <ikke> you can set `git config --global commit.verbose true` to have this always enabled
[23:31:32] <Kill-Animals> ikke: Do you reccomend it?
[23:32:09] <ikke> It can help when you write the commit message
[23:32:49] <Kill-Animals> ikke: But you don't personally use it?
[23:32:53] <ikke> I do
[23:33:03] <Kill-Animals> Good enough for me.
