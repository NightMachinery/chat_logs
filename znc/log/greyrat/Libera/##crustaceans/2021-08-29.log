[20:14:56] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:14:59] <pja> Especially with ICUs the way they are right now in the US. The UK is better, but as a consultant friend told us, the frog is finding the pot getting hotter, especially if they’re an unvaccinated frog...
[20:16:13] <companion_cube> That's... Scary, are people dying that much?!

[20:17:09] <companion_cube> Right, but still
[20:17:47] <companion_cube> I guess there's an insane bias selection since that is about people sick enough to go to the icu
[20:18:07] <Brekkjern> Yep. It's the opposite of "Survivorship bias" :P
[20:18:29] <pja> I don’t know what the survival rates were like in the UK once you were intubated, but from that thread they’re not great in the US.
[20:20:59] <pja> Obvs if you need intubation then things are bad.
[20:21:42] <pja> I think one of the things that confuses people is that they see decent recovery rates from Intubation, but don’t realise that that’s only "we discharged them from hospital"
[20:22:10] <Brekkjern> Kinda dumb to label it as "recovery rate" then...
