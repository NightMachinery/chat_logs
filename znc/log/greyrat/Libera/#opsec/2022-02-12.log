[04:31:12] <jan6> lol
[04:31:40] <jan6> basically going e-sim only, according to leaks
[04:33:15] <jan6> which is...uh...not good at all, not the least because it's not even that reliable with multisim, and breaks the ability to buy native local sim when travelling, since that will switch out your normal number, etc
[04:35:14] <jan6> not even touching all the privacy and whatnot issues, e.g. how can you ever be sure that any "deleted" esim is actually deleted, and not kept in a backup history file, or such

[19:53:39] <Joanna> Ai is just another name for buggy software  and universal basic income is another name for welfare.  They are not going to give out unlimited welfare benefits, they will cull the population. Welfare for ordinary people was gotten rid of a long time ago and was never sufficient to live well on before that.
