[00:03:31] <drakonis> adhd is a fad now?
[00:03:32] <drakonis> wtf
[00:05:35] <imode> tbh I ragged on ADHD when I was younger, because it was diagnosed for literally every kid that didn't like doing schoolwork.
[00:05:57] <wrl> drakonis: yeah i've heard a lot of people complain about it
[00:06:05] <wrl> "back in my day, kids were kids" type beat
[00:06:35] <drakonis> oof
[00:06:42] <imode> when you make someone sit in a fuckin' boring ass classroom for 8 hours and deprive them of their basic human rights, yeah, we're going to be fidgity litle fucks.
[00:06:57] <imode> that don't wanna sit down and be babysat.
[00:07:03] <wrl> facts
[00:07:46] <imode> schools are glorified daycare so that mommy and daddy can go be productive workers without having to "worry about their family". all the while the business owners get to spend time with their families.
[00:07:56] <imode> fuck this dynamic and fuck the system.

[03:44:10] <indigo> dimadima: is this even while you have pods running?
[03:51:47] <dimadima> indigo: yeah
[03:52:11] <dimadima> if you don't kubectl for some period of time (never measured it), the next kubectl takes a while
[03:52:44] <dimadima> it's fair enough, i only have one master and it's "free", but would be nice if you could pay for it to stay up or something
[03:53:21] <dimadima> really i should have said "mildly annoying"
[03:54:29] <dimadima> average response time after time out is probably 15-30 seconds
[03:58:08] <indigo> Sheesh, that's even worse than Lambda cold start times
[03:58:15] <indigo> I thought you had to buy instances for GKE
[03:58:38] <indigo> You're still paying for the compute for those, right? Why do they have to spin things down? :P
[04:01:08] <dimadima> i understand why lambda should be snappier. this is just kubectl... unless you're experiencing an emergency or something, waiting a 15 seconds for it to list your pods isn't too bad?
[04:01:21] <dimadima> it probably just feels forever
[04:01:41] <dimadima> i'll start doing `time` to see what the real responses are like. it's probably 5 secnds :)
[04:01:59] <dimadima> yeah you guy instances, those are always running and you're paying ro those
[04:02:13] <dimadima> the control plane can (and does) go away and those just keep running fine
[04:02:48] <dimadima> it would probably be way excessive for them to run the control plane for all customers when most ppl use it like 3 times a day, if that
[04:02:52] <dimadima> i got days w/o kubectl
[04:03:03] <dimadima> go*
[04:03:15] <dimadima> though real active products probably run kubectl all the time
[04:03:32] <dimadima> that's me more and more, praise the lord
[04:03:47] <indigo> I bow to your kube expertise
[04:03:57] <dimadima> i'm just a user
[04:04:05] <indigo> At my last company, Kube was... cursed
[04:04:13] <dimadima> it would be fun to set it up and try to operate it myself
[04:04:22] <dimadima> but i hear it's difficult. though who knows
[04:04:26] <indigo> The payments stack was down for a day because of some SkyDNS upgrade that couldn't be rolled back
[04:04:28] <dimadima> why was it cursed?
[04:04:33] <dimadima> oh
[04:04:43] <dimadima> intense
[04:04:53] <indigo> But I think that's why you should run on GKE instead of running your own control plane
[04:04:57] <dimadima> yes.
[04:04:58] <dimadima> lol
[04:05:13] <indigo> Also man... https://nuphy.com/products/air75 such a sexy keyboard

[04:05:16] <dimadima> ppl like to run on prem or baremetal... but that's the last thing i need in this world
[04:05:28] <indigo> Yes, especially if you're early stage startup
[04:05:35] <dimadima> that looks really nice
[04:06:01] <dimadima> i have a friend who's really, really into mechanical keyboards
[04:06:27] <dimadima> you like them?
[04:07:31] <dimadima> was skydns at some point standard on kubernetes?
[04:07:49] <dimadima> i'm feeling like that may have been a thing but i can't remember
[04:07:53] <dimadima> skydns was cool
[04:08:09] <indigo> Personally I dislike mechanical keyboards and type on an Apple Magic Keyboard
[04:08:20] <dimadima> ^ me too
[04:08:24] <indigo> I feel like mech keyboard can get a little circlejerky
[04:08:35] <dimadima> i even liked the butterfly keyboards. like... a lot
[04:08:44] <dimadima> never related to the popular hatred
[04:09:26] <indigo> Also this review for it mentions "lubing the switches"
[04:09:30] <dimadima> lolol
[04:09:37] <dimadima> just buy a car at that point
[04:09:41] <imode> dimadima: the problem with the butterfly keyboards iirc is that... they fail. a lot.
[04:09:54] <imode> or maybe I'm just thinking of the mac problems.
[04:10:10] <dimadima> imode: i was going to say, yeah, i believe they were a terrible nuisance to the people who got lemons
[04:10:38] <imode> this looks like a nice keyboard.
[04:11:45] <imode> cyberdecks are underrated.
[04:12:20] <dimadima> i had a patched skydns on dockerhub that someone started using i guess cause it got 10k downloads somehow https://hub.docker.com/r/dminkovsky/skydns

[04:29:43] <imode> 's alright. been thinkin bout stuff.
[04:29:59] <imode> preparing for the black hole that is on-call.
[04:30:29] <imode> how's yours going.
[04:31:25] <indigo> Not bad! Just finished watching a Danish murder show
[04:31:37] <indigo> https://www.netflix.com/title/81039388 pretty good
[04:31:38] <buttsbot> The Chestnut Man | Netflix Official Site
[04:32:51] <indigo> Sorry to hear about oncall :( I also hate oncall, especially non-actionable pages (which is 95% of the pages I get)
[04:34:39] <cb> whats with scandinavians and murder mysteries
[04:35:18] <dimadima> people make so much cool stuff, it's endless
[04:36:04] <dimadima> "murder show" is a nice name for the genre
[04:37:13] <dimadima> "it's endless" in a positive way
[04:41:17] <imode> indigo: fwiw, our "oncall" isn't page-based, it's "handle these issues" based. 500 a month, plus 2 hours of meetings from 8:30 to 11:00 AM every single day, plus tickets, plus development.
[04:41:34] <imode> 500 is the low mark, too.
[04:42:13] <dimadima> how long is your oncall
[04:42:20] <imode> two weeks!
[04:42:20] <dimadima> week? 2 weeks?
[04:42:32] <dimadima> so that's 250?
[04:42:38] <imode> 2 weeks on, 4 weeks off.
[04:42:41] <imode> yup!
[04:42:52] <imode> but you're always secondary before and after you're on.
[04:42:58] <imode> so..
[04:43:15] <imode> you're still handling some issues. and I handle issues related to the testing environments I'm responsible for (I implemented them).
[04:43:32] <indigo> imode: That's good that you don't get paged at 3AM
[04:43:35] <dimadima> how was 500 arrived at?
[04:43:38] <imode> oh I never said that.
[04:43:43] <imode> we just ignore those.
[04:44:04] <imode> dimadima: actual metrics. as in, this is how much was handled over a month.
[04:44:22] <dimadima> so ~500 arise on avg
[04:44:34] <imode> 500 has been the minimum. they're all entered in a slack channel via a slack workflow.
[04:44:54] <indigo> Do you wake up at 3AM or are the pages silenced
[04:44:54] <imode> it used to be worse: we didn't used to have a dedicated channel. they'd just ping all of our team members.
[04:45:22] <imode> used to be that we were woken up at 1 AM, 2 AM, etc. because customers aggressively ping us.
[04:45:43] <imode> we basically just said "fuck off" at one point and collectively disabled notifications.
[04:45:56] <imode> sometimes they get through, though, so we do wake up.
[04:46:30] <dimadima> so you probably don't have time for non-support work?
[04:46:53] <imode> pretty much, but we're expected to shove it in anyway.
[04:49:18] <indigo> Heh, that reminds me of our team's policy
[04:49:23] <indigo> "no non-oncall work during oncall weeks"
[04:49:40] <indigo> Like the world is supposed to just stop when you go oncall? :-)
[04:50:10] <indigo> Not to mention the context switching after you get back from oncall back to your projects
[04:50:20] <imode> my manager has basically said "you set the tone, but I don't expect you to be available for non-oncall stuff during oncall".
[04:51:07] <imode> and yeah, it's brutal. 25 requests/day, each of which could last from maybe 5 minutes to a multi-week investigation.
[04:51:27] <dimadima> ruff
[04:51:40] <imode> on top of office hours. which are 4 meetings, a half hour each (that always run over) in the mornings.
[04:51:59] <imode> improper decompression made one of our teammates take personal leave for three months.
[04:52:11] <imode> I haven't had a day off since April.
[04:54:17] <dimadima> just to make sure, that doesn't include weekends right?
[04:54:34] <imode> I've worked some weekends.
[04:54:47] <dimadima> april is a while
[04:54:51] <dimadima> for a corporate job
[04:54:59] <dimadima> bummer!
[04:55:01] <imode> I'd like to take a damn month off.
[04:55:05] <imode> just get my head right.
[04:55:11] <dimadima> yeah
[04:55:23] <dimadima> gah
[04:55:31] <imode> leaves you so little time to prepare for other bullshit interviews too.
[04:55:36] <imode> so if you want to leave, tough shit.
[04:55:43] <imode> you don't get a lot of vacation time.
[04:55:56] <imode> and every time I leave something fucking breaks.
[04:56:04] <imode> "oh prod went down while you were gone".
[04:56:06] <imode> "PARDON?!"
[04:56:20] <imode> "yeah everything is still broken can you help fix pls k thx"
[04:58:30] <dimadima> errors in my API :( brb
[04:58:40] <dimadima> this conversation cursed me
[04:58:44] <imode> sorryyyy.
[04:58:48] <dimadima> or maybe it's the users <3
[04:59:17] <dimadima>  /contact-request-respond - Uniqueness violation. duplicate key value violates unique constraint "contact_pkey" <--- the worst
[04:59:31] <dimadima> sadness
[04:59:33] <imode> ruh roh.
[05:00:01] <indigo> imode: Look at the bright side, if prod went down while you were on vacation and it wasn't fixed by the time you got back, maybe it's just not that important?
[05:01:03] <imode> HAH
[05:01:24] <imode> no, it means that nobody figured out how to bring it back up yet.
[05:01:35] <imode> or there's an even larger issue at hand.
[05:01:54] <indigo> Have you considered stepping back? Maybe other folks might learn how to fix it ;-)
[05:02:17] <imode> trust me, I'm not the expert here.
[05:02:32] <imode> the bus factor is just really, really low right now and we're trying to increase it.
[05:03:16] <imode> nobody wants to, though.
[05:04:07] <indigo> This is when you play MegaCorp politics and make others feel the pain
[05:04:30] <imode> there ain't nobody to feel the pain but us. we're downstream and we own all of the things that broke.
[05:04:34] <imode> and we're understaffed.
[05:04:46] <indigo> Sounds like a bad place to be in
[05:05:27] <imode> yyyyyup.. and it's not getting better.
[05:09:59] <dimadima> bus factor
[05:10:07] <dimadima> an excellent term
[05:10:42] <indigo> Bus error
[05:10:52] <dimadima> old school
[05:13:46] <dimadima> imode how did it come to be that in a place like amazon--and i get that they're understaffed--but how did it come to be of the that the staff that does exist not everyone can fix prod
[05:14:03] <dimadima> or the bus factor for fixing prod is 1, even though there may be more than 1 person
[05:14:11] <dimadima> they don't hire dummies?
[05:14:19] <dimadima> do the hire dummies?
[05:14:22] <dimadima> are those ppl busy?
[05:14:31] <dimadima> doing other shit that doesn't involve learning how to fix prod?
[05:14:32] <imode> put it to you this way.
[05:15:11] <imode> the org structure has it so that my team and the other team are split in duties. let's call them team 1 and team 2. I am on team 1.
[05:15:43] <imode> team 1 is support and tool development. team 2 is core service development. team 1 owns the "onboarding process" for team 2's services.
[05:15:59] <imode> meaning, if a customer (external dev team) wants to push shit to us, we have to tell them how to do it, walk them through how to do it, etc.
[05:16:15] <imode> we're the first point of contact if you're touching team 2's stuff.
[05:16:29] <imode> we're also a dev team. we have a good tap into what these customers want.
[05:17:01] <imode> the split is supposed to be.. while you're in your onboarding phase, which is 6-10 weeks on average, we help you with whatever issues are related to that onboarding.
[05:17:36] <imode> these can range from "how tf do I use git" to "how do I express this increasingly large feature in the smallest amount of time possible with minimal away team effort because my team is also understaffed and higher ups don't give a flying fuck".
[05:18:10] <imode> in short, our customers are either super-lazy/super-inexperienced or under enormous pressure which makes the quality of their work plummet.
[05:18:48] <imode> team 1 is split into two groups. one dealing with one domain, the other dealing with the other.
[05:19:01] <imode> these domains are accounting (i.e booking stuff) and royalty calculation.
[05:19:10] <imode> I am on the accounting side.
[05:19:35] <imode> team 2 deals entirely with accounting-oriented services, with another team, team 3, sending stuff to team 2's services.
[05:20:13] <imode> there are six people on team 1, so you'd think the split is 3/3. it used to be 4/4, and at one point was 2/1.
[05:20:24] <imode> team 2 has a similar head count but no team split.
[05:20:44] <indigo> That sounds really complicated
[05:20:53] <imode> three members (including myself) had to be poached to support a lot of development tasks that team 2 just cannot get to.
[05:20:56] <imode> including a lot of ops tasks.
[05:20:57] <indigo> Probably the pizza box thing
[05:21:04] <imode> that's how bad of a position we're in.
[05:21:37] <imode> we do not have enough capacity to deal with the issues that have been flooding in and still maintain these systems.
[05:21:40] <indigo> Sounds like your manager needs to step up
[05:21:50] <imode> I have no manager.
[05:22:01] <imode> rather, my manager swapped from managing team 1 to team 2. he's currently managing both teams.
[05:22:06] <imode> we have not found a replacement.
[05:22:16] <imode> he's doing the best he can.
[05:22:22] <imode> very nice person.
[05:23:11] <imode> I've been working on a role transition and he's basically like "could you please like, write some of this for me".
[05:23:36] <imode> like, the actual transition doc.
[05:23:48] <imode> I feel bad for him. he does try his best and is always on our side. he's a shit umbrella.
[05:27:00] <imode> oh thank god tomorrow's meetings are light.
[05:29:03] <dimadima> imode looking forward to reading this after i figure out my issue, thanks a lot for typing this up.
[05:29:29] <imode> np.

[05:53:49] <imode> several someones, actually.
[05:53:50] <dimadima> imode: so they ask these dev to balance binary trees but they don't know git?
[05:53:58] <imode> yyyup.

[05:54:03] <dimadima> :(
[05:54:04] <companion_cube> tbh git doesn't balance its trees
[05:54:09] <companion_cube> checkmate ;)
[05:54:11] <imode> fwiw I had exactly one leetcode question during my interview.
[05:54:17] <imode> and it was the easier one.
[05:54:24] <imode> or one of the easier ones.
[05:54:32] <dimadima> how do they hire devs who don't know git
[05:54:36] <dimadima> how/why
[05:54:46] <imode> I mean.
[05:54:49] <dimadima> i'm a naive person i guess because i'm kind of stunned
[05:55:03] <imode> colleges don't teach git.
[05:55:08] <imode> so.
[05:55:16] <dimadima> well so they shouldn't
[05:55:17] <imode> college hiring pipelines and large amounts of foreign dev labor.
[05:55:31] <imode> tons of our teams are in india.
[05:55:32] <dimadima> but the ppl should know hit
[05:55:34] <dimadima> damn that's fucked up
[05:55:40] <dimadima> damn
[05:55:51] <dimadima> git*
[05:55:58] <dimadima> maybe i need a mechanical keyboard or something
[05:56:09] <imode> not to disparage any indian devs _whatsoever_, but there's a cultural pressure to do lots of stuff quickly.
[05:56:09] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[05:56:20] <imode> and push back if it's not done quickly.
[05:56:43] <dimadima> whatever man. git is the mostly poorly taught thing in computers
[05:56:58] <imode> I'd argue "how to write software" is.
[05:56:58] <dimadima> but at amazon you're telling ppl how to creatae branches
[05:57:00] <dimadima> that SUCKS
[05:57:16] <dimadima> that happens at my mom's work and she works at a big uni
[05:57:28] <dimadima> and that's totally fine but damn, at amazon
[05:57:30] <dimadima> imode: i guess
[05:57:51] <dimadima> controversial statement: there's no *right* way to write software
[05:58:02] <dimadima> but there *is* a right, single way to make a branch
[05:58:09] <dimadima> there may be no *right* git flow
[05:58:23] <dimadima> but there's really only a couple to chose from that make even the slightest sense
[05:58:55] <dimadima> i'll stop my bemoaning, but i'm floored you have to do with that
[05:59:39] <dimadima> if for no other reason i didn't actually figure out my issue
[05:59:40] <imode> nah you're not bemoaning. and you're right, with all of the ways to structure a program, there's no correct way.
[06:02:06] <dimadima> it's really sad no one knows git
[06:02:09] <dimadima> as an aside
[06:02:18] <dimadima> most ppl know how to make a branch
[06:02:28] <dimadima> but the way git is taught, few ppl actually know git
[06:02:46] <dimadima> maybe i'm overstating how few
[06:03:04] <dimadima> but if you start by teaching ppl how to "commit" and "pull"
[06:03:12] <dimadima> well ,if you introduce "pull"
[06:03:17] <dimadima> you're in for a bad time
[06:03:33] <dimadima> "pull" should have never been made
[06:03:37] <dimadima> rebase should be like topic #2
[06:03:55] <dimadima> after commit
[06:04:13] <dimadima> well really interactive adding should be topic #2
[06:04:15] <dimadima> then rebase
[06:07:23] <dimadima> how are you supposed to create a commit if you can't interactively stage
[06:07:38] <dimadima> whether with a terminal or a GUI
[06:13:45] <imode> my attention is being split, one moment.
[06:15:52] <dimadima> that's cool just ignore that it's a bemoaning about git pedagogy
[06:16:27] <dimadima> figured out my issue though. it's really true how users will find any flaw in your software. this paritcular flaw i figured would take a while to hit
[06:16:50] <dimadima> but this little group of ppl joined and started using the app and hit this flaw in like 48 hours
[06:17:01] <dimadima> awesome

[08:10:34] <indigo> dimadima: you can respect the consensus-builders, but it still takes a quarter to launch a new checkbox
[08:15:49] <Church> Something something rachelbythebay post
[08:16:18] <imode> where does that particular user work. I assumed google.
[08:16:35] <Church> https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/08/28/big/
[08:16:35] <buttsbot> Big company tale: six months for a list and a button
[08:16:43] <Church> Previously Google, then fb
[08:16:50] <Church> Now I think freelance? Idk
[08:16:57] <Church> They're pretty opaque about it
[08:17:20] <imode> wouldn't be surprised.
[08:31:04] <indigo> Hah, this story is sadly representative of some projects
[08:33:34] <dimadima> i saw that when it obviously topped HN for a whole week :)
[08:33:59] <dimadima> very interesting indigo
[08:34:15] <dimadima> thanks for the perspectives ... would be interesting to experience it some day
[08:34:32] <indigo> Yeah! Definitely worth experiencing
[08:35:37] <imode> whether it's worth staying is another story.
[08:37:25] <indigo> IMO it’s really more of a “game” sometimes than actual software engineering
[08:37:36] <imode> it absolutely is.
[08:38:22] <imode> which should tell you what matters in business: relationships and interactions with people.
[08:38:45] <indigo> You have to get your project past Team A, B, C to launch. Team A wants you to use their data format, team B wants you to use a certain algorithm to aggregate the data, team C wants you to remove certain data altogether, etc
[08:39:11] <imode> some days you're those teams. some days you're reaching out to those teams.
[08:39:20] <imode> (most days, I am those teams.)
[08:40:44] <indigo> I just wish we’d iterate faster
[08:41:11] <imode> I should start an education startup.
[08:41:12] <indigo> Sometimes we’re about to launch something and some team kindly lets us know that the ground has shifted
[08:41:31] <indigo> After working on the project for a year…
[08:42:24] <dimadima> heh
[08:42:45] <dimadima> why an education startup imode
[08:43:18] <dimadima> indigo: all i can do is smh a little
[08:44:14] <dimadima> sounds like pros/cons you know
[08:44:20] <dimadima> frustrating i guess
[08:44:22] <dimadima> at times
[08:45:46] <imode> dimadima: because a lot of programmers aren't familiar with the fundamentals of computation, or how wide their field is.
[08:45:59] <dimadima> oh a programming education startup?
[08:46:02] <imode> and because teaching people is fun.
[08:46:04] <imode> yup.
[08:48:42] <imode> one of the things I would do would be to do project-based learning, but all projects are due at the end of the overall experience. this allows you to go back and refactor your previous projects using new knowledge.
[08:49:04] <imode> portfolio building as an educational goal is very important. a strong portfolio will get you anywhere.
[08:49:20] <indigo> dimadima: the pay is good, and I like the people on my team. Heck, we even have a Dima
[08:51:56] <imode> the least taught but most needed skill for CS grads would be "how to decompose a problem and build a solution for it with logical problem solving".
[08:52:21] <dimadima> indigo: lol but i am _dima_dima
[08:52:32] <dimadima> take that, unary dima
[08:53:37] <dimadima> imode: so why is that whole leetcode thing hyped so much if you only had to do one problem
[08:53:44] <imode> no kidding.
[08:53:55] <dimadima> it's a very different experience reading hacker news
[08:54:01] <imode> leetcode is a memorization exercise.
[08:54:42] <dimadima> yeah
[08:55:02] <dimadima> it stresses me out cause i refuse to engage in that sort of activity
[08:55:14] <dimadima> i'll understand and remember for a while
[08:55:16] <imode> it's hyped because it tests "did you do XYZ at uni".
[08:55:24] <imode> and "can you memorize shit".
[08:55:29] <dimadima> but if i don't apply knowledge, i do everntually have trouble being able to reconstruct it
[08:55:45] <dimadima> no but i mean why did you only get one such q
[08:55:48] <imode> and uh, no, I don't have a degree, and I memorize things I need and can't derive easily.
[08:55:56] <dimadima> whereas if you read on HN, ppl seem to get day and days of them
[08:56:05] <imode> oh, because nobody near my team could do a leetcode problem.
[08:56:08] <imode> except the easiest ones.
[08:56:12] <dimadima> so how did they get in lol
[08:56:22] <imode> my org doesn't do that shit.
[08:56:32] <dimadima> tbh i'm fine not having a job at a leetcode place it's just annoying that it excludes me from places
[08:56:39] <imode> tell me about it.
[08:56:52] <imode> I had a shot at a Google interview lately and I turned it down because I didn't want to be waterboarded.
[08:56:59] <dimadima> are you not able to do leetcode probs on whiterboard?
[08:57:25] <imode> I was able to do it at Amazon.
[08:57:27] <dimadima> imode: i went so far as to burn google recruitment bridge like 10 years ago
[08:57:35] <imode> that was probably a good idea.
[08:57:35] * bkero wonders if they give leetcode problems to SREs, or just drop them into a gdb session connected to a qemu VM
[08:57:48] <imode> bkero: _that_ would be a challenge.
[08:57:53] <dimadima> i was like "i don't think i'll ever be a good fit for google please don't contact me"
[08:57:54] <imode> I'd _like_ that.
[08:57:56] <dimadima> lol
[08:58:07] <dimadima> which in retrospect was stupid
[08:58:15] <imode> like that says "put me in a problem and let me feel it out".
[08:58:21] <dimadima> but i appreciate knowing i was such a passioante 25 year old
[08:58:26] <imode> "nobody's seen the right answer (exactly)."
[08:59:03] <imode> dimadima: every megacorp (and every business) wants to underpay you for your ability. they know a majority of their engineers can fuck off and reproduce what they do and fill market niches they aren't in.
[08:59:48] <imode> learn from fairchild.
[09:00:12] <dimadima> bkero: i think they give them leetcode, but i'm not sure
[09:00:41] <imode> my bad, not fairchild, shockley.
[09:00:41] <bkero> Joy of joys
[09:00:54] <dimadima> shockley?
[09:01:03] <imode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight
[09:01:03] <buttsbot> Traitorous eight - Wikipedia
[09:01:23] * dimadima pins tab
[09:01:32] <dimadima> looks like a great entry
[09:01:51] <imode> engineers in aggregate are smart individuals. or at least used to be.
[09:02:00] <dimadima> the irony for me is that i love that leetcode/algo shit
[09:02:01] <imode> independently they're just weirdos.
[09:02:07] <imode> or programming afficionados.
[09:02:08] <dimadima> it's just i don't wnat to do it like that
[09:02:23] <dimadima> annoying
[09:02:39] <dimadima> if i already knew it from a CS degree and it was just a periodic brush up, that would be fine i guess
[09:02:49] <dimadima> but i'm not going to learn that shit now to get a job when i get another job
[09:03:04] <imode> a majority of it isn't even used.
[09:03:31] <dimadima> is that comment about engineers in aggregate inreference to something in particular?
[09:03:43] <imode> you'll understand what I mean when you see the article.
[09:04:02] <dimadima> thanks
[09:04:16] <imode> my little expert system constructs a prefix trie from a set of semantic triples for easy traversal and querying, so you can do a bunch of stuff with the stream API on that constructed trie.
[09:04:17] <dimadima> i'm sure it's not
[09:04:23] <dimadima> that said i don't begrudge them for testing it
[09:04:28] <imode> nobody in my org knows what the fuck a trie is.
[09:04:44] <dimadima> i used to know whatw a trie is
[09:04:55] <imode> one of them questioned why I wasn't using "something in the java standard library".
[09:04:56] <dimadima> can't say i ever implemented one
[09:05:07] <imode> it's like. did you learn anything that you can use in the workplace.
[09:05:23] <imode> did you just focus on frameworks and then ignore the actual "build software on my own" part.
[09:05:45] <dimadima> but why were they wrong
[09:06:00] <imode> because all of our software is SHIT.
[09:06:07] <dimadima> but the java libs aren't shit?
[09:06:20] <imode> because nothing in the java standard library lets me do anything like that!
[09:06:30] <dimadima> (this is where i learned about tries https://immutable-js.com/)
[09:06:30] <buttsbot> Page not found · GitHub Pages
[09:06:34] <imode> it's like saying "why isn't your chat app in the node standard library".
[09:06:40] <dimadima> imode: well there we go
[09:06:54] <imode> "why aren't you using something that someone else wrote".
[09:06:56] <dimadima> (of course immutablejs is now dead)
[09:07:08] <dimadima> they're just not comfortable having to maintain that
[09:07:16] <dimadima> i mean you know that
[09:07:18] <imode> they aren't maintaining it, and never will.
[09:07:26] <dimadima> or even having it as a black box
[09:07:36] <dimadima> that isn't addressed to oracle when it breaks
[09:07:39] <imode> I'm totally okay with saying that software engineers right now are dumb as bricks in the aggregate.
[09:07:43] <dimadima> or your javaSDK team
[09:07:55] <imode> like the majority of them just know how to use a particular framework.
[09:08:03] <imode> get confused and angry when they see something they don't know.
[09:08:04] <dimadima> sure
[09:08:08] <imode> don't document anything or don't ask questions.
[09:08:12] <imode> and love to shit on others.
[09:08:15] <bkero> I'm about as skeptical of average programmers writing their own data structures and traversal algorithms as most cs folks are about developers writing encryption code.
[09:08:15] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[09:08:39] <bkero> If you're doing it you'd better have a good reason, and what exactly were you trying to accomplish when you set out?
[09:08:45] <imode> bkero: _because average programmers don't give a shit about how to use these things_.
[09:09:11] <imode> also, if that's the average attitude in the megacorp space, _why are we testing for it on hire_.
[09:09:19] <imode> why is _this_ the bar. we should be able to _write algorithms_.
[09:09:36] <dimadima> yeah i don't think anyone would disagree w/ you on that
[09:09:39] <bkero> To weed out applicants who don't have the same academic background as those interviewing them.
[09:09:42] <imode> you either test for something you expect to use or you fuckin' don't. a trie is basic computer science. a traversal algorithm is basic computer science.
[09:10:06] <imode> comparing it to home-rolling a crypto system is a strawman or something akin to it.
[09:10:23] <dimadima> i'll tell you, growing up and to this day, ppl shit on standardized tests. but my experienc was that all the smart kids did well on the std tests, and all the less smart kids did worse
[09:10:27] <dimadima> in fact, in my grade
[09:10:43] <dimadima> everyone's std tests basically fell in line with how i perceived their intelligence
[09:10:47] <bkero> I do recall learning R/B trees, AVL trees, and other manner of binary search trees, not tries in particular.
[09:10:51] <dimadima> with few exceptions
[09:10:56] <imode> tries are incredibly useful.
[09:11:03] <bkero> I get you like them, that's cool.
[09:11:05] <imode> balanced binary trees, not so much.
[09:11:15] <imode> as in, you probably won't need to whip one up.
[09:11:24] <imode> tries on the other hand are something that's kind of per-problem.
[09:11:36] <imode> because they're parameterized on the idea of an alphabet.
[09:11:45] <bkero> Parameterized, but not written from scratch
[09:11:50] <bkero> Unless you're dicking around with Fuscia
[09:12:00] <imode> huh? no, usually written from scratch.
[09:12:37] * bkero looks at skeeto/trie C99 trie and pytrie
[09:12:45] <imode> because actually extending that parameterization to code is a waste of abstraction.
[09:12:47] <bkero> Well, google/pygtrie
[09:13:23] <bkero> Waste of an abstraction, or dicking around with debugging traversal algorithms all day, or just throwing it away once you're gone and someone has to clean up your shit?
[09:13:39] <imode> _why are you implementing something you do not fully understand_.
[09:13:49] <imode> I don't understand the excuse behind that.
[09:14:02] <bkero> _why are you implementing something nobody else on your team understands?_
[09:14:47] <imode> imagine me asking you "why are you using GDB on that QEMU VM, doesn't QEMU have its own 'solve this problem' button?"
[09:15:01] <imode> as in, you're assuming this solution exists elsewhere in a manner that will optimally solve my problem.
[09:15:14] <imode> which is a false assumption that arrogant programmers use in projection of their underlying inexperience.
[09:15:18] <imode> to which I will say to you: git good.
[09:15:34] <imode> genuinely. if you don't understand it, I will be _happy_ to document the shit out of it for you and point you to the places so you can brush up.
[09:15:41] <imode> there is no excuse.
[09:15:50] <bkero> Part of becoming a senior developer has been realizing that 10x engineers 'gud' is generally a liability long term for this exact reason
[09:16:10] <imode> because you don't understand a bog-standard implementation of a standard trie with a template element filled in?
[09:16:28] <imode> how far down is the fucking bar.
[09:16:47] <imode> what _do_ they teach in uni, eh.
[09:16:53] <bkero> It could be redefining a string. That code surface is a liability, no matter how low the bar.
[09:17:10] <bkero> and unless there's good value in having that custom code there, it's just engineering wankery
[09:17:27] <imode> _that_ is different. redefining core datatypes that have specific expectations is very, very far off than "I'm morphing this data into this structure so it can be queried like this".
[09:17:56] <imode> when did "I don't understand this" become "this is a liability" rather than "if this is required, maybe we should get our engineers to understand this".
[09:18:31] <bkero> When projects need to bring on more developers and have a timeframe that doesn't include bringing engineers up-to-speed on your snowflake
[09:18:35] <imode> because what the fuck is the difference from implementing it yourself and declaring a dependency on another component _when you don't understand the function of either_.
[09:18:55] <bkero> Someone wrote tests and supports that other component
[09:19:00] <imode> _when the fuck is a trie a snowflake. it's CS 102._
[09:19:04] <bkero> and it's a widely used open source library that gets community fixes
[09:19:15] <imode> it's. a. data. structure.
[09:19:19] <bkero> and has been in use for decades
[09:19:20] <imode> it doesn't need "community fixes".
[09:19:34] <bkero> It's a data structure and a few algorithms for operations
[09:19:54] <imode> it's insertion and enumeration. did anybody anywhere ever pay attention in CS 102.
[09:19:56] <imode> at all.
[09:20:04] <imode> did any of you actually learn anything from the courses you paid to take.
[09:20:20] <imode> or did that debt go to your head and you're trying to weasel out from under it by taking a job that you can scrape by at.
[09:20:22] <imode> jesus fucking christ.
[09:20:46] <dimadima> imode don't you think that's a bit disingenous?
[09:20:49] <dimadima> like
[09:20:49] <bkero> Amazon was made for you.
[09:20:50] <imode> that was not a personal attack on you, just a pattern I've seen in a lot of communities.
[09:21:10] <dimadima> code has edge cases
[09:21:14] <dimadima> those edge cases need tests
[09:21:27] <imode> where the majority of them band together to complain about being in debt yet not actually absorbing any of the knowledge that they were paying for. and I'll grant that those courses probably sucked.
[09:22:00] <dimadima> https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pragmatic-software-testing/9780470127902/ch02.html
[09:22:01] <buttsbot> 2. Triangle Test Exercise - Pragmatic Software Testing: Becoming an Effective and Efficient Test Professional [Book]
[09:22:21] <dimadima> let's not focus on the ppl you dislike at your job
[09:22:55] <dimadima> and focus on the fact that writing software is often extremely deceptively tricky
[09:22:59] <imode> but it's infuriating to see "this is too complex" put out when it's literally "I didn't pay attention in my computer science course and I need my package manager to hold my hand so that my equality operator has 122 tests behind it and is declared as a dependency".
[09:23:27] <bkero> Library bloat is a problem, just like NIH is.
[09:23:38] <imode> like okay, your solution to the complexity problem is that, instead of understanding it, you declare a dependency. how far down do you have to set the bar before you declare a dependency on another identical product.
[09:23:48] <imode> it'd be like dimadima declaring a dependency on rocket.chat and setting the send delay to a day.
[09:24:02] <imode> there is a _balance_. and it lies somewhere above basic data structures.
[09:24:26] <imode> ...and somewhere below balanced binary trees.
[09:24:30] <dimadima> imode: the wankers you don't like are lazy and suck and don't understand it
[09:24:59] <dimadima> meh
[09:25:02] <imode> I'm more than happy to give them a 4-paragraph CS 102 course to accompany this for a CYA, and have done so. the problem is they don't even try.
[09:25:03] <dimadima> i won't complete that thought
[09:25:25] <imode> CYA == cover your ass. meaning if someone has to maintain this and genuinely never got that, here's a lovely overview of wtf is going on.
[09:25:29] <dimadima> i'm just going to say their shittiness and lack of effort is orthogonal imo
[09:25:41] <dimadima> orthogonal to the point
[09:25:52] <dimadima> sometimes you do need to write a topological sort
[09:25:59] <dimadima> kafka streams has a topologica sort in there
[09:26:07] <dimadima> why didn't they use a library for that?
[09:26:08] <imode> that I agree with. and to your point, bkero, Amazon's NIH is just.. I could rant for days on it.
[09:26:18] <imode> the rest of the senior engineers I see could rant for days.
[09:26:23] <imode> and in fact have.
[09:26:31] <imode> we invent everything because we're afraid of everything.
[09:26:54] <bkero> That's why I never applied to Sysops at Google after interning there.
[09:27:13] <bkero> Need config management? FUck puppet, cfengine, chef, etc. They wrote their own in pymock.
[09:27:26] * imode shudders in appconfig.
[09:27:49] <imode> but at some point there's gotta be a balance, right? you can't chuck moore the whole stack unless you have a higher quality hiring pool, but you can't have a higher quality hiring pool and still have the same hiring volume.
[09:28:07] <bkero> If you do you end up with Galois.
[09:28:08] <imode> so at what point does the hiring volume and the NIH-factor settle out.
[09:28:20] <imode> lmfao.
[09:28:21] <bkero> and you write everything in Erlang
[09:28:45] <imode> maybe I should be an erlang dev.
[09:28:51] <imode> they have their shit down.
[09:28:56] <bkero> Some settle out at glibc. Some settle out in boost. Some settle out with whatever's available in NPM.
[09:29:09] <bkero> Glibc is fine, boost is tolerable (barely). NPM is right out.
[09:29:40] <imode> I joked the other day that Amazon should import the "include everything" metapackage just to cover all of our bases.
[09:29:46] <bkero> Deviating from glibc and we'd better be doing some heavy optimized problem, otherwise we're in the weeds holding unmentionables in our hands.
[09:29:50] <imode> the fact that I wasn't immediately laughed out of the room made me almost throw up.
[09:30:55] <imode> bkero: curious as to what you mean by "deviating from glibc".
[09:31:31] <imode> it's the standard lib, you're gonna need to define _some_ custom types.
[09:31:38] <bkero> Implementing data structures and traversal algorithms that could possibly have edge cases and are generally more than 20-30 lines of C.
[09:31:55] <imode> here's a question for you and I want you to consider it seriously.
[09:33:01] <imode> I'm (for example) a game developer. a pretty common data structure is a rectangle. it has a set of algorithms associated with it to find its midpoint, corners, area, etc. it also has rotational components to it as well, so that it's not purely axis-aligned.
[09:33:28] <imode> should I, the game developer, be the one to implement this rectangle?
[09:34:13] <imode> the reason I think it's a good question is because it's something that nearly every gamedev touches at some point. basic geometry stuff isn't typically seen as a "fundamental data structure" but it's generic enough to apply to so many domains it hurts.
[09:34:23] <imode> and there's no good generic libraries for it for a lot of languages.
[09:34:33] <imode> that's got to say something about where the bar is set.
[09:35:02] <imode> because at the logical conclusion of "don't implement anything weird", there's some classification method for whether something is "weird".
[09:35:20] <imode> if you don't explain it, to me, that says "nobody should implement anything and we should just tape shit together until it works".
[09:35:29] <imode> up to and including fragments of your business logic.
[09:35:34] <bkero> As a game developer are you making an engine or just using Unity?
[09:36:01] <bkero> If I'm using Unity then I'm likely operating at a much higher abstraction that would call for that
[09:36:02] <imode> assume I'm just a dude using C and SDL, that's a common case. or say, C# and whatever the .NET flavor of the month is for a game dev kit.
[09:36:09] <bkero> Then yeah
[09:36:37] <imode> then I'd ask you: why is unity the point where I'd already have that type defined.
[09:36:47] <imode> and not have to build it myself.
[09:37:01] <imode> why don't we have a standard geometry library.
[09:37:25] <bkero> There are geometry libraries for unity that do that
[09:37:47] <bkero> Why write your own which will be shittier and you will have to support and are not likely to be forwards-compatible?
[09:38:12] <imode> sure. but why, again, is unity the point where I say "yes, this thing needs its own generic library".
[09:38:38] <bkero> Since the work done at that level is of a higher abstraction
[09:38:56] <imode> then what is the difference between a rectangle and a trie?
[09:39:12] <imode> what about if you were writing this in python and pygame?
[09:39:23] <imode> ... and is pygame still a thing.. I don't know if that's old.
[09:39:29] <bkero> Google wrote a nice, better implementation of trie in pygtrie than you will
[09:39:40] <imode> have you looked at it? in what world can you be sure of that.
[09:39:41] <bkero> and potentially faster
[09:39:54] <bkero> Looked at it and used it in other applications
[09:39:56] <imode> it's also for... python, and I'm not using python, I'm using java.
[09:40:17] <imode> "I do recall learning R/B trees, AVL trees, and other manner of binary search trees, not tries in particular."
[09:41:10] <bkero> For my university learnings, correct.
[09:42:47] <imode> "Google wrote a nice, better implementation of trie in pygtrie than you will" I like how you speak with such certainty on this, as if you have evidence to inform you of that.
[09:43:14] <imode> despite their implementation being about as bog-standard as you can possibly get, if not a little ugly.
[09:43:48] <bkero> Is it better tested than yours?
[09:44:01] <imode> at least they make the effort to provide a proper traversal method.
[09:44:05] <bkero> More compatible? Been used for longer with a wider install base?
[09:44:22] <bkero> Code quality side, is it less of a liability than yours?
[09:44:42] <imode> I can guarantee you it isn't because it's functionally identical.
[09:45:10] <bkero> Functionally identical yet written in a different language
[09:45:25] <imode> sans most of the stuff you need in python to coerce things to do what you want.
[09:45:30] <imode> yes. because it is a DATA. STRUCTURE.
[09:45:46] <imode> it's almost like they have definitions that exist outside of programming languages!
[09:46:06] <imode> outside of particular implementations, even!
[09:46:19] <bkero> Data structures are of limited use without functions around them to take advantage of their properties
[09:46:29] <bkero> and those functions are not all created equal
[09:46:33] <imode> ...and this is called business logic, yes.
[09:46:43] <bkero> Nope, I'm talking traverse() too
[09:47:14] <imode> a data structure is not just a literal structure, but a series of operations associated with it.
[09:47:31] <imode> so, yes, those are defined outside of the aforementioned implementations.
[09:47:45] <bkero> Is a struct a data structure?
[09:48:12] <bkero> C99 struct with no operations
[09:48:26] <imode> a particular struct could be. it has access methods, so yeah, why not.
[09:48:38] <imode> access methods being the implicit dot and arrow operators to get values.
[09:49:00] <imode> a pair is a datastructure.
[09:49:14] <imode> in fact one of the most fundamental.
[09:50:25] <imode> what you're probably asking me is "what operations should be defined as core to a particular data structure", and that's one to ponder.
[09:51:38] <imode> data structures conform to required access and mutation patterns. deciding what's a core access or mutation pattern is usually informed by the problem the structure is trying to address.
[09:52:35] <imode> at bare minimum there's "read the data according to some access method", because you need to get data back from what you're constructing at _some point_, otherwise why bother storing it.
[09:52:49] <imode> so I'd guage that some abstract traversal should be one of your first things you cover.
[09:52:54] <bkero> TPMs don't allow that
[09:53:09] <bkero> You can consider the key in TPM to be a data structure. You're only allowed to make challenges of it. Not read it.
[09:53:18] *** Joins: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz)
[09:53:37] <imode> trusted platform module I take it?
[09:53:41] <bkero> Indeed
[09:53:45] <bkero> or take the blackhole engine in mariadb
[09:54:05] <bkero> Do you think there's operation on the data structures (not) backed by it?
[09:54:20] <imode> not familiar with the specifics of a TPM but I assume you issue a challenge to it _as a TPM_ instead of the actual key, because a key in my mind is a sequence of data elements, usually bits or bytes.
[09:55:13] <imode> as in you have to take the TPM as a whole working system, with state, etc.
[09:55:40] <imode> so yeah I'd consider the "state of the TPM" as a data structure, as in there's some structure to it. why wouldn't I, just look at your favorite emulator.
[09:56:15] <imode> do you get _anything_ back from a TPM, though? wouldn't be useful if you didn't.
[09:56:40] <imode> in that case... access method's right there.
[09:57:16] <bkero> You can interact with it
[09:57:18] <bkero> You can't read it though
[09:57:31] <imode> define interact. I have to be able to get _some_ useful data out of it at some point.
[09:57:43] <bkero> Yes, you issue challenges against it
[09:58:00] <imode> and if your challenge is correct you get back some data.
[09:58:14] <imode> rather, whatever data you asked for.
[09:58:19] <imode> it's an auth system, right.
[09:58:34] <bkero> Potentially. Or something is updated with no feedback to the user.
[09:58:41] <imode> key, door, key open door, data behind door, you open door to get data.
[09:59:16] <imode> ah so it's a repl-ish thing, neat. I should probably dig deeper into that.. probably some good DEFCON talks on whatever TPM is in this machine.
[09:59:22] <bkero> Uh, it's more like "use your secret to sign this for me"
[09:59:56] <bkero> but higher constructs can be built on top of it like "please be my totp source"
[10:00:14] <bkero> All the way up to remote attestation of system firmware state
[10:00:19] <imode> oh so you actually sign the "message" you send to the TPM and if the TPM can decode it it does something.
[10:00:35] <imode> or am I reading that wrong.
[10:01:10] <imode> huh.
[10:01:28] <bkero> keygen, decryption, signing, sealing, certifying keys are the operations
[10:01:53] <imode> that's a rabbit hole to go down next weekend.
[10:01:57] <bkero> It's, uh, not simple.
[10:02:03] <bkero> Good luck
[10:02:06] <imode> but that decryption, certification, signing, keygen, etc.
[10:02:08] <imode> that stuff.
[10:02:25] <bkero> Yes, those would be operations
[10:02:39] <imode> that's "getting data back". my point is that there's always some sort of "read" operation, however abstract, that indicates a transaction going _to_ the requester, not a write.
[10:03:15] <bkero> I bet we can think of a readless data structure that is written to
[10:03:27] <imode> _that_ I'm curious on, at least one that's practical.
[10:03:36] <bkero> Maybe a ML dataset.

[10:04:37] <imode> still, they can be.

[10:07:12] <imode> oh that conference paper is probably referencing stuff like externally-controlled registers.
[10:09:28] <bkero> Yeah I'm out. Gotta work tomorrow and my eyes are glazing over.
[10:09:41] <bkero> Enjoy your WOMs

[16:38:06] <ngoldbaum> yes
[16:38:16] <ngoldbaum> go’s problem space is much much bigger
[16:38:25] <gerikson> it is a product of the inscrutable East
[16:38:58] <ngoldbaum> that’s why computers beat humans at chess in the 90s but it took until the 2010s for computers to beat humans at go
[16:39:28] <ngoldbaum> deep blue was basically a big database search, that strategy doesn’t work for go because the problem space is so huge

[18:04:26] <dimadima> use it or lose heh
[18:04:28] <prussian> vaxx is minor invasion, rona is more sustained assault. That's my guess.
[18:04:29] <prussian> anyhow.
[18:04:30] <dimadima> lose it *
[18:04:42] <prussian> not a biologist though.
[18:04:44] <companion_cube> I'm ready for booster shots, Biden, bring it on
[18:04:55] <prussian> ^ ya I don't care. I just don't want to be sick
[18:05:00] <prussian> Being sick is lame
[18:05:12] <companion_cube> you don't say 😁
[18:05:12] <prussian> how am I supposed to jog and work and shit?
[18:05:26] <dimadima> ^^
[18:05:33] <companion_cube> r/hca doesn't make me want to get sick
[18:05:51] <prussian> dimadima: Connecticut
[18:06:02] <ngoldbaum> you can just walk into most pharmacies and ask for one right now
[18:06:22] <prussian> corona?
[18:06:26] <prussian> I mean for flu, ya.
[18:06:27] <ngoldbaum> a booster
[18:06:35] <companion_cube> I thought they were not approved yet
[18:06:44] <prussian> also, speaking of vaxxes. where is the so-called universal flue vaxx?
[18:06:49] <prussian> flu* even
[18:06:51] <ngoldbaum> they’re supposed to give them out to anyone with a condition that makes them predisposed to more risk
[18:06:58] <ngoldbaum> so you can just say that
[18:07:04] <prussian> love it...
[18:07:04] <dimadima> yeah in the USA there's no pattern i've been able to discern in any population. just some people wear masks properly, some do not
[18:07:07] <dimadima> and it's everywhere
[18:07:43] <dimadima> i want a good flu vax. maybe moderna will have one soon
[18:07:48] <ngoldbaum> prussian: flus have so much generic variability that it’s very difficult to come up with one
[18:07:50] <prussian> "Software huddle" sounds like such a lame meeting name.
[18:08:01] <dimadima> in person, too?
[18:08:15] <prussian> a universal one is in trials now though, afaik
[18:08:22] <prussian> dimadima: lol
[18:08:31] <prussian> let's huddle and breathe on everyone
[18:08:38] <prussian> no
[18:08:40] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: ohh!
[18:08:43] <companion_cube> good to know
[18:08:43] <prussian> this is all remote right now.
[18:08:45] <companion_cube> I _do_ have a preconditoin
[18:08:50] <prussian> gl
[18:08:58] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: N-95 masks are protective for you even if you’re around other people who are wearing masks poorly
[18:09:20] <prussian> you can really walk-in Covimarty or whatever though?
[18:09:21] <ngoldbaum> you do need to be wearing the N-95 with a good seal though
[18:09:39] <prussian> sounds to error prone
[18:09:48] <ngoldbaum> prussian: in the US, yes, the FDA approved it a few weeks ago
[18:10:05] <prussian> I meant like, it's that available now?
[18:10:08] <prussian> damn.
[18:10:18] <ngoldbaum> yes, any pharmacy that has covid vaccines
[18:11:31] <prussian> reminds me... I have bills to pay
[18:11:34] <prussian> lol
[18:11:52] <prussian> medical that is.

[20:01:13] <companion_cube> The out-of-chain empowerment
[20:01:17] <companion_cube> How is that possible
[20:01:31] <kline> what point is cryptographically secured money/assets if you can socially engineer the opensea staff to make transfers you dont have the keys for?
[20:03:27] <cb> i think if (huge if) cryptocurrencies become a thing, this entire layer of cryptocurrencies is a substrate for something that is user friendly and can do things like rollbacks
[20:04:01] <bkero> Cryptocurrencies already support destructive rollbacks
[20:04:21] <bkero> Look at the success of Ethereum Classic and fee wars
[20:04:33] <cb> outside of what you think of the political/environmental/economic ramifications i think the cryptocurrency enthuiasts are obsessed with the prototype (bitcoin, eth) instead of trying to take the interesting parts of it and build a system learning from its flaws
[20:04:33] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[20:04:38] <cb> instead they think the flaws are the point
[20:04:57] <ngoldbaum> but the obfuscation is the point

[20:17:03] <gerikson> Stroustroup is on brand ``In addition, I learned a fair bit from programming for money - where understanding of real-world problems, correctness, maintainability, on-time delivery, etc. were more pressing than in an educational setting.''
[20:18:07] <companion_cube> lol
[20:18:15] <companion_cube> "on time" not an issue in an academic setting? wtf
[20:19:40] <indigo> I understood that in the sense: academic projects are research, and it's very hard to put a time frame on research
[20:21:08] <ngoldbaum> my second-hand impression is that the pypy codebase and rpython are so complicated that very few people can productively contribute, might explain where PSF is coming from…
[20:24:20] <kline> pypy are overly reliant on python 2
[20:24:42] <dimadima> didn't they drop python 2?
[20:25:11] <kline> cpython sunsetting python2 shouldnt matter, likewise the psf shouldnt be getting nasty with the trademark
[20:25:40] <kline> if pypy decide that py2 is more valuable to them/easier to run with than 3 then they can do that on their own
[20:25:46] <kline> e z
[20:26:19] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: yes but rpython is a subset of python2 so it costs them nothing to support it

[20:55:20] <prussian> oh
[20:57:31] <imode> I'm in a meeting so I can't watch, anything stupid happen.
[20:58:19] <companion_cube> iVaccine with the chip
[20:58:22] <prussian> just words, words, words and graphs that have labels that mean nothing.
[20:58:23] <prussian> oh
[20:58:31] <indigo> tl;dr: computer company says their new processors are faster without any real metrics
[20:58:32] <prussian> and now we got 4 TIMES something performance
[20:58:39] <prussian> what indigo said
[20:58:51] <companion_cube> to be fair my boss got an m1
[20:58:57] <companion_cube> and apparently it *is* fast AF
[20:59:03] <companion_cube> at least on our cpu bound workloads
[20:59:18] <gwozniak> It's amazingly fast for our compiler builds
[20:59:30] <gwozniak> At least on the Mac Mini I was working on
[20:59:45] <prussian> I love how they show pre-rendered video content to describe FASTNESS
[21:00:09] <gwozniak> And that was with Carbon Black and Spotlight running, even
[21:00:23] <prussian> Carbon Black? I'm so sorry
[21:00:41] <prussian> I told IT to fuck off when they wanted me to install that on my work laptop.
[21:00:43] <gwozniak> The speed of the build was basically the same as our big Linux server
[21:00:46] <ngoldbaum> indigo: there’s a graph! … with no y-axis scale
[21:01:02] <indigo> The y-axis scale is "relative performance"
[21:01:20] <indigo> Also known as "blingle bongus"
[21:01:21] <gwozniak> prussian: I can't have my machine on the VPN without it, although I do have a special profile so it's less intrusive
[21:01:30] <prussian> gwozniak: ya I noticed that in general the cpu's of laptops, desktops, servers, etc all seem to have the same functional units to compile code about as fast as each other.
[21:01:33] <kline> i had to close the stream
[21:01:33] <indigo> Is Carbon Black like Orphan Black
[21:01:36] <kline> its just too depressing
[21:01:43] <prussian> I mean I've seen laptops churn out code faster than some desktops..
[21:01:50] <prussian> churn through.
[21:01:58] <prussian> gwozniak: damn..
[21:02:02] <indigo> Lol why is it depressing kline
[21:02:19] <prussian> And here I am, like hacking the planet to get openconnect to work with work's anyconnect.
[21:02:24] <kline> apple: "we're doubling down on closed source everything, end of general purpose computing is here, also please give us $170 for earbuds you need to recharge twice a day"

[21:02:38] <prussian> gross...
[21:02:40] <prussian> man
[21:02:50] <prussian> This is why I dread going back to big corp(tm)
[21:02:55] <prussian> which is soon...ish
[21:03:08] <prussian> kline: powerful.....
[21:03:11] <prussian> this is the future
[21:03:15] <kline> BOLD
[21:03:23] <kline> BRAVE
[21:03:23] <gwozniak> I think there was a breach of some kind a while ago and we went from "almost no security" to "full security" in short order
[21:03:25] <indigo> Oof, there is a notch
[21:03:26] <kline> bananas
[21:03:29] <prussian> HAHAHAH
[21:03:33] <prussian> kline: you closed it too soon
[21:03:35] <indigo> A notch on the screen of the MBPs
[21:03:46] <prussian> I am laughing so hard right now. They brought back Fn keys
[21:03:50] <prussian> and took the bar out.
[21:04:02] <gwozniak> Sounds like this event is typical marketing nonsense
[21:04:10] <prussian> well... ya.
[21:04:23] <gwozniak> Credit to at least correcting their mistakes
[21:04:24] <prussian> hey, blame someone else for mentioning it. wouldn't even be watching it otherwise.
[21:04:28] <imode> I'm watching it now.
[21:04:33] <imode> this oughta be good.
[21:04:47] <prussian> imode: You missed them going back on keyboard sins, again....
[21:04:53] <indigo> Surprised that they did a magsafe charger
[21:04:59] <imode> no more touchbar?!
[21:05:02] <prussian> nope.
[21:05:04] <prussian> rip
[21:05:06] <imode> rip.
[21:05:13] <prussian> Fn keys and esc forever I guess.
[21:05:26] <imode> good.
[21:05:36] <imode> why the fuck do I care about bezel.
[21:05:41] <prussian> lol. they added a notch to the macbook
[21:05:48] <imode> lmfaoooo.
[21:05:55] <imode> oh that'll be lovely for hackintoshes.
[21:06:33] <prussian> I wonder how all the devs that spent time on touchbar support feel right now.
[21:06:39] <indigo> That notch is ugly as sin :(
[21:06:44] <imode> fuck apple. just sayin'.
[21:06:55] <prussian> ok. cool. 120hz laptop displays.
[21:07:00] <gwozniak> prussian: I do most of my work in a Linux VM locally and there's no Carbon Black there, so I mostly don't notice these days
[21:07:01] <indigo> https://livecenterimagesnorth.azureedge.net/lc-images-2021/lcimg-dbbf28e3-568c-48d1-8c66-10c4149e89fe.jpg jesus
[21:07:27] <imode> I like how they flashed the actual UI for a moment because they know its shit.
[21:07:41] <prussian> gwozniak: Carbon Black sounds pretty useless if it can be subverted by a hypervisor lol
[21:07:44] <imode> why do I want the "impossibly thin" thing that can break if I look at it.
[21:07:47] <prussian> but ya
[21:07:54] <prussian> when I worked at Cigna, it was the same for me.
[21:08:01] <prussian> I did everything in a EL7 VM.
[21:08:10] <dimadima> indigo: what is that
[21:08:15] <gwozniak> prussian: as for the effectiveness of this CB thing, well, I have no idea
[21:08:28] <indigo> dimadima: That is one of the new Macbook Pros
[21:08:34] <prussian> ya... most that stuff is probably.
[21:08:35] <gwozniak> But if I run builds on macOS (the native machine), then it's pretty slow
[21:08:36] <prussian> anyhow
[21:08:36] <indigo> Enjoy having a chunk of your screen gouged out
[21:08:59] <dimadima> safe-area-inset-top
[21:09:01] <indigo> Because you'll never have an app with a menu bar that extends the full width of your screen
[21:09:01] <gwozniak> A notch?  Really?  I guess this is now a big iPhone
[21:09:20] <dimadima> weird render
[21:09:20] <prussian> But ya. our corporate overlords demanded I have Carbon Black and I just told them I was running a kernel newer than CB works with and they just meh'd and never followed up.
[21:09:31] <prussian> gwozniak: yep
[21:09:42] <prussian> I still want to know how the touch bar people feel
[21:09:53] <dimadima> indigo: is this released today? nothing on HN
[21:09:55] <prussian> because you just know they'll have to support both for a long time.
[21:10:04] <indigo> dimadima: Yes, the event is going on now
[21:10:08] <dimadima> i see
[21:10:10] <gwozniak> No one I know used the Touchbar, even my friends that are big apple fans
[21:10:19] <prussian> dimadima: https://www.apple.com/apple-events/event-stream/

[21:10:30] <prussian> If you care to watch.
[21:10:34] <prussian> It's pretty dumb.
[21:10:46] <prussian> I mostly watch these to kill time.
[21:11:00] <dimadima> thanks prussian
[21:11:14] <imode> who thought the notch was a good idea.
[21:11:18] <prussian> idk.
[21:11:41] <prussian> You guys brought up a good point though, how does the notch work with app menu bars?
[21:11:42] <dimadima> it's kinda nice? i don't have a notch phone but my wife does, it's okay?
[21:13:08] <imode> it's stupid.
[21:13:37] <prussian> I just... I don't know.
[21:13:45] <prussian> My phone has a window and it looks silly
[21:13:50] <prussian> like a tiny cut out
[21:14:35] <gwozniak> What does the notch do on their phones?  I honestly don't know.
[21:14:53] <gwozniak> Neither my nor my wife's phone has it
[21:15:54] <indigo> TBH I don't think it will be that big of a deal unless you are running full screen games, or playing full screen video
[21:16:59] <prussian> ^
[21:17:01] <gwozniak> I do mostly work on an external monitor
[21:17:06] <prussian> tend to agree in practice.
[21:17:28] <prussian> LOOK, the notch is better than what Dell did with their looking-up-nose camera.
[21:18:10] <companion_cube> but is it a top notch
[21:18:27] <imode> booooooo.
[21:18:55] <imode> what a circlejerk.
[21:20:31] <indigo> Lol, the Verge liveblog is all "omg we have ports and no touchbar!! buy buy buy"
[21:20:36] <prussian> That ending credit sequence... why do I care if the crew filming them all were masked and stuff?
[21:20:37] <indigo> So basically we have stepped back to 2015
[21:20:52] <prussian> it's like new coke to coke classic.
[21:20:56] <prussian> duh
[21:22:16] <dimadima> HDMI?
[21:25:45] <ngoldbaum> i don’t notice the notch
[21:26:17] <dimadima> that's the only port i'd possibly ever miss
[21:26:33] <dimadima> i was with them on the ports removal
[21:28:00] <indigo> It would be hilarious if Apple brought menu bars into the app window
[21:28:14] <gerikson> so apple has entered its terminal "fanservice" phase
[21:28:26] <gerikson> I guess Steve Jobs really is dead
[21:29:01] <gerikson> lol HN front page lighting up with Apple adverts
[21:30:36] <deadk> i was with them on the ports removal too
[21:31:34] <deadk> it's not like you carry around your external monitor, you can just leave a dock/adapter/thing plugged into it and pretend it's a usb-c monitor
[21:32:37] <ngoldbaum> oh huh they brought back magsafe
[21:32:45] <deadk> i also didn't like magsafe :|
[21:33:05] <dimadima> me too deadk. i liked it until i saw how the removed it, and then i liked that more
[21:33:10] <ngoldbaum> it was nice to have power, data, accessories, and video all on one cable
[21:33:15] <dimadima> they*
[21:33:36] <ngoldbaum> i guess you don’t have to use magsafe?
[21:33:43] <ngoldbaum> but then only three ports
[21:33:44] <ngoldbaum> odd
[21:33:56] <companion_cube> apparently the EU is going to enforce usb-c ?
[21:34:07] <companion_cube> (I mean, I _think_, I'm not sure)
[21:43:55] <cb> "end of general purpose computing" will never fail to make me laugh
[21:44:51] <dimadima> but it's not funny :(
[21:45:11] <cb> it's funny because it's histronics
[21:45:38] <gerikson> there will always be GP computers ,but they will become less and less mainstream and more and more expensive
[21:45:48] <gerikson> sorta like pro cameras
[21:46:03] <dimadima> i guess
[21:46:14] <gerikson> everyone else will happily carry a locked-down phone, becuase it's way simpler to use and own
[21:46:36] <gwozniak> pretty much, yeah
[21:46:37] <cb> i mean apple has no interst in making the macs anything other than general purpose computing
[21:46:52] <cb> they could easily lock out linux and they explicitly allow for it
[21:46:52] <gerikson> there are real societal goods in having a kernel/core/whatever that's secure
[21:46:57] <dimadima> cb: i dunnnnooo
[21:47:06] <dimadima> look at the iphone
[21:47:11] <ngoldbaum> some of the security decisions in new macos updates kinda feel like they’re going in that direction
[21:47:23] <dimadima> they would if they could
[21:47:33] <ngoldbaum> like making it impossible for you, the admin account, to do certain things without a lot of pain
[21:47:52] <gerikson> I've read Ariadne (Alpine) saying that you can just self-sign whatever blob and the M1 can boot it
[21:47:58] <ngoldbaum> this is why i don’t have macs anymore
[21:48:02] <cb> read marcan's notes on the m1
[21:48:10] <gerikson> apple is intereested in making macOS secure/verifiable
[21:48:14] <cb> it's very cclear the boot arch allows for a lot of flexibility in policy
[21:48:24] <gerikson> if you buy a Mac and boot lulnix on it, no skin off apple's back
[21:48:26] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: yeah they added that, the lockdown is at the OS level not the hardware level
[21:48:32] <gerikson> right
[21:48:51] <dimadima> all of that may be true, but something about even histronic attacks on general purpose computing is something i can't see humor in
[21:49:15] <cb> i find it mostly overblown
[21:49:20] <dimadima> culture/words are important. histronics often go places
[21:49:21] <gerikson> dimadima: there's no need for jackboots, non-GP computing is what the market wants
[21:49:48] <indigo> +1 I don't think most people care that they can program their computers
[21:50:02] <gerikson> where I to make a famous piece of art I'd rely on courts (aka "men with guns") to protect my legacy, not a bunch of pirates ;)
[21:50:07] <indigo> They just want to send email, browse the web, look at photos of their kids
[21:50:31] <gerikson> indigo: s/.*/use facebook/ ; )
[21:50:47] <indigo> Yep
[21:51:02] <gwozniak> Whaddya mean people don't want to write XSLT?!?
[21:51:12] <prussian> What's a comuter?
[21:51:16] <imode> what computer
[21:51:17] <prussian> computer*
[21:51:24] <prussian> gwozniak: well... ya
[21:51:25] <prussian> I mean
[21:51:26] <prussian> who does
[21:51:42] * gwozniak is currently writing some XSLT
[21:51:48] <prussian> Reminding me yet again, why the fuck is XML so "bloated"
[21:51:50] <ngoldbaum> hello computer
[21:51:56] <indigo> https://youtu.be/nUsDk8wjRPs all those Linux users
[21:51:56] * ngoldbaum talks into mouse
[21:51:56] <buttsbot> LinuxCon Worldwide 2021 - YouTube - https://youtu.be/nUsDk8wjRPs
[21:52:02] <companion_cube> maybe the general purpose computers will be the equivalent of raspi
[21:52:05] <companion_cube> smaller machines
[21:53:21] <gerikson> I think the main enemies of GP computing (the copyright mafia) are oretty happy with the sitch right now
[21:53:29] <prussian> indigo: I was in the background of that con.
[21:53:31] <gerikson> no need to close every damn loophole
[21:53:46] <cb> it's hard enough for the average person
[21:55:40] <indigo> IMO the copyright mafia finally embraced streaming, and that killed most of piracy
[21:57:38] <Brekkjern> And then they decided that they wanted piracy back again by making their services suck
[21:57:42] <deadk> i'm happy to see someone who is not me using the term "the sitch"
[21:58:02] <deadk> Brekkjern: i think the main problem with the streaming services now is that there are too many of them
[21:58:06] <deadk> but that's not something they did on purpose
[21:58:28] <dimadima> XSLT is cool
[21:58:35] <ngoldbaum> indigo: you would too if you got the deals the RIAA and MPAA got from the streaming services
[21:58:36] <deadk> yes
[21:58:52] <Brekkjern> deadk: Yes they did. There is nothing prohibiting them from licensing away their content to several streaming services, but they decided they would rather have their own
[21:58:59] <dimadima> v2 though, not sure what happened with XSLT 3
[21:59:04] <ngoldbaum> somehow artists make tiny fractions of a penny per stream on spotify and yet the record companies don’t mind i wonder why
[21:59:13] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[21:59:45] <deadk> Brekkjern: right, but they didn't want everyone else to. for any specific haver of lots of copyrights, it probably makes sense to start your own streaming service, because you get more money that way
[21:59:54] <deadk> even though it hurts you if everyone starts their own
[22:00:33] <Brekkjern> Yeah, they are so hungry for that short-term money that they are willing to sacrifice the long-term
[22:00:48] <Brekkjern> And they are doing this intentionally
[22:01:02] <deadk> i don't think they are. it's a paradox of competition
[22:01:38] <Brekkjern> I can go to Apple, Google, or any other place and rent or buy the movies digitally, but if I want to stream them? Fuck no! We have an exclusive deal with Netflix or some shit so you have to use them
[22:01:39] <deadk> if all the other copyright havers start their own streaming services, and you don't, you're at a disadvantage
[22:02:42] <gwozniak> indigo: that video is great :)
[22:02:54] <Brekkjern> There's also way too many movies/series that I can't legally watch in Norway on any streaming service
[22:02:58] <indigo> I love Krazam, they have some good stuff
[22:03:40] <indigo> Brekkjern: Same here in the US, sometimes you are trying to find a movie and it's on some niche streaming service now
[22:04:06] <gwozniak> Everyone has Criterion, right? ;)
[22:04:50] <Brekkjern> It's amazing how both Steam and Spotify killed game and music piracy, and it was nearly killed for movies and TV series with Netflix, but now they gotta go and incentivize it again
[22:05:01] <prussian> We need a TV guide to tell us on what streaming platform things are on.
[22:05:05] <prussian> wait....
[22:05:12] <prussian> are we going backwards?
[22:05:15] <Brekkjern> Yes
[22:06:09] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: i was just reading the other day how metroid dread runs emulated on PC at like 144 fps in 4k, so now not only is nintendo competing with free, but also a better experience overall
[22:06:34] <Brekkjern> Especially when it's nearly trivial to get a Plex server set up with automagic torrent downloads of movies/TV series
[22:09:26] <Brekkjern> Trivial for technologically competent people that is :P
[22:10:59] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: the kind of PC with a graphic cards that is currently impossible to find?
[22:11:54] <ngoldbaum> even a 4 year old PC can emulate a switch with better than native performance
[22:12:16] <riv> I tried to emulate mario galaxy on switch but it had a low FPS
[22:12:21] <ngoldbaum> the architecture they used was underpowered when it came out so it could work in a portable form factor
[22:12:24] <riv> It would be nice to emulate it fast
[22:12:33] <riv> I think it was yuzu I tried
[22:12:47] <ngoldbaum> why not dolphin?
[22:13:00] <riv> hmm
[22:13:09] <imode> use dolphin.
[22:13:37] <riv> I'll try it
[22:23:02] <companion_cube> otoh the switch is a nice self contained thing
[22:23:07] <phytyca> the new macbook is like a monkey's paw: you get your ports back, but now you have a notch
[22:23:13] <companion_cube> I sold my old gaming computer because it took too much space
[22:23:43] <riv> i really want to play the new pokemon that is coming out on switch
[22:23:49] *** Quits: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:23:55] <riv> Pokémon Legends: Arceus
[22:28:16] <indigo> Monkey paw remove notch: the notch is gone, but now you have a nose cam
[22:34:55] * ngoldbaum can’t see how the notch matters
[22:35:50] <ngoldbaum> tbh the m1 air at $1000 hits the sweet spot for me
[22:36:03] <ngoldbaum> if i were in the market
[22:36:04] <phytyca> lol yeah the notch isn't awful esp since its apparently a mini-led screen and its a taller aspect ratio - its just the meme
[22:36:20] <phytyca> ngoldbaum: agree. the great battery life + great perf + low price are very attractive
[22:36:23] <riv> it kind of blows my mind how much work hobby people are doing to put linux on it
[22:36:36] <phytyca> esp with all the apparently undocumented behavior
[22:38:10] <phytyca> hm. i do like that you can get the beefy cpu on the 14" model apparently
[22:39:55] <ngoldbaum> oh wow
[22:39:58] <ngoldbaum> battery life tho
[22:40:12] <phytyca> yeah :\
[22:40:17] <ngoldbaum> how much is a fully specced out 16”?
[22:40:22] <phytyca> though - if it's 20hrs down to like 14hrs that might be more acceptable
[22:40:33] <ngoldbaum> it’ll be interesting to see the new mac pros too
[22:40:34] <phytyca> not sure - lets see if the configurator is up.
[22:40:36] <ngoldbaum> eventually
[22:41:22] <phytyca> ngoldbaum: a cool $6.1k for beefiest CPU, 64G RAM, 8tb SSD
[22:41:30] <ngoldbaum> lmao
[22:41:35] <ngoldbaum> you know people will buy that
[22:41:49] <phytyca> oh yeah definitely
[22:42:03] <phytyca> hm. i wonder how fast the storage will be. i heard its pretty good on the M1 laptops
[22:42:24] <phytyca> (not a mac guy, but if i could buy a board with one of these chips i probably would)
[22:46:03] <phytyca> indigo: monkey paw nose cam - no more camera up nose, but it's an inverse notch like seen on some of the asus laptops where its actually _above_ the screen
[22:46:41] <indigo> Funny enough, I don't actually mind that
[22:47:12] <indigo> It'll be something to grip as you open the laptop
[22:47:26] <ngoldbaum> phytyca: when i was a grad student, purchases above $5000 were considered to be “major capital expenditures” and weren’t subject to overhead charges on grants, so there was a computer price at like $3000 or so where you might as well just spend $5000 because the price to the grant would be the same
[22:47:52] <ngoldbaum> putting the fully specced out one at $6100 a little sus :p
[22:48:14] <ngoldbaum> they may have also increased the threshold since then that was a while ago
[22:52:21] <phytyca> hahaha! tahts actually a great tidbit.
[22:52:37] <phytyca> true about the grabbiness part...i miss having a button to press to release the lid too
[22:54:55] <gwozniak> Whenever my wife's Surface Book gives it up, her next machine will be an M1 mac of some kind
[23:01:42] <indigo> Ooh, Expensify is going public... I think I have a friend who works there
[23:01:51] <indigo> Made it to the BIG LEAGUES
[23:13:33] <phytyca> never heard of expensify. looks cool. i hate concur.
[23:17:47] <indigo> I used to hate Expensify until I started using Concur
[23:19:47] <phytyca> concur's OCR is so bad
[23:20:03] <phytyca> when it works it works - but holy crap sometimes it misses the easiest ones
