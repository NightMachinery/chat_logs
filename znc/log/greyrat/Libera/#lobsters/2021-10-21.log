[17:06:38] <kline> quantum lobster
[17:07:40] <pushcx> Ansible is brittle and makes it hard to iterate to set stuff up. There's a couple things subtly wrong like logrotate not rolling the Rails logs unless the puma workers restart. Which is not the end of the world, that happens every time I deploy, but earlier this year we ran out of disk because I was so busy with external stuff that I didn't deploy for a couple weeks.
[17:08:22] <phytyca> ahhh that is a pain.
[17:09:20] <pushcx> I'm also just... kind of offended at how slow Ansible is. A zero-change deploy still takes like 5+ minutes to run. I have no idea what it could be doing with that time. Five seconds would be long.

[17:20:46] <shapr> We could do the first DC area #lobsters meetup, even if it's just you and me
[17:20:56] <c355E3B> Yeah!

[17:21:59] <c355E3B> We have an office in DC, so we (probbably) have the space to host it, and its right by metro center.

[17:23:32] <shapr> companion_cube: I'm in the next state over, but close enough that I could throw a baseball into DC
[17:25:57] <companion_cube> right, but which state
[17:26:08] <shapr> maryland
[17:26:24] <shapr> companion_cube: where are you?
[17:26:25] <companion_cube> ah! well I could throw a baseball into Maryland too

[17:27:49] <shapr> I'm good at organizing meetups
[17:28:14] <shapr> One time I was interviewing with a company, and found out there were two other people interviewing for the job.
[17:28:14] <companion_cube> is loving Haskell a requirement?
[17:28:26] <ngoldbaum> whole foods‚Äô main redeeming quality is stocking all of the tony‚Äôs chocoloney varieties
[17:28:40] <ngoldbaum> particularly the 52% dark milk chocolate which is the best
[17:28:42] <companion_cube> this whole foods' main quality is the burger stand inside
[17:28:44] <shapr> Took me fifteen minutes to find out who they were and convince them that we should all interview on the same day.
[17:28:53] <companion_cube> so you could assassinate them?
[17:29:05] <shapr> Took another few days to get the company to let me organize a conference in one of their spare rooms.
[17:29:19] <shapr> That conference lasted another four years after I started it.
[17:30:00] <shapr> And we got attendees from all over Europe!

[23:33:35] <pja> I had a blast. Although people hate the stealth sections, they are in fact all avoidable if you apply logic.
[23:33:54] <pja> (stealth / horror ish sections.)
[23:33:58] <mouseghost> ah
[23:34:01] <mouseghost> im yet to finish it
[23:34:05] <mouseghost> the base game, that is
[23:34:28] <pja> Oh, well: finish the base game if you can - the finale is fantastic.
[23:37:10] <pja> If you want a hint, shout.
[23:37:11] <wink> if it didnt have such a stupid name, like the other game

[23:37:31] <wink> yea
[23:37:33] <pja> Outer Wilds is the puzzle one with the wooden spaceship. It‚Äôs great.
[23:37:51] <wink> I watched a letsplay because I would have never bought or played it

[23:47:33] <companion_cube> no thanks :D
[23:47:33] <pja> (but you‚Äôre on IRC, so...)
[23:47:36] <companion_cube> I play to relax
