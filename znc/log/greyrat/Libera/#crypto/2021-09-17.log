[00:05:35] <srmo> Hello, I'm playing my first CTF. Now I have stage with a webserver, that takes a http parameter which is bas64 encoded binary stuff. If I fiddle with it, I sometimes receive a message "Incorrect amount of PKCS#7 padding for blocksize". A bit of searching says that this is indicative of a padding oracle attack. For this, I would need the blocksize
[00:05:36] <srmo> but I have no idea hwo to determine it. I'm a crypto noob.
[00:06:00] <srmo> I have the possibility to generate arbitrary parameters that either get rejected or accepted.
[00:06:28] <srmo> *sorry for the typos :/
[00:07:13] <ms7821> what happens if you just keep increasing the size of the base64-encoded data?
[00:07:42] <srmo> at one point the parameter gets to big for the server to handle.
[00:08:49] <ms7821> that's quite vague
[00:09:16] <ms7821> I'd expect it to return a different error every time it passes the length check
[00:09:41] <srmo> if I just append random char, stuff goes wrong. I figured that the strings generated by the server always follow a 32byte, 16*n byte, 32 byte pattern. I.e. I can add 16byte chunks in the middle (between the 2 32byte chunks) and base64 encode the result and the sever will accept it (i.e. not show an error)
[00:10:17] <srmo> ms7821 not sure, the only error I could provoke so far is this "Incorrect amount of PKCS#7 padding for blocksize" message
[00:10:20] <Alipha> srmo: well, so, you progressly create blocks ending in 0x01, then 0x02 0x02, then 0x03 0x03 0x03, etc. if you get to 0x09's and the padding oracle attack fails, then you know it's an 8-byte block size. otherwise it's 16 bytes
[00:11:37] <Alipha> srmo: oh. that's an interesting way to do it. what happens if you add a 8-byte chunk in the middle?
[00:11:58] <srmo> Alipha, thanks for the hint! I'm just sad I don't understand why this gives me the the blocksize. Let me try the 8byte thing
[00:12:35] <ms7821> I think it does give you the blocksize
[00:13:03] <ms7821> oh I misread
[00:14:39] <srmo> Alipha, adding an 8byte chunk fails. adding the 8byte chunk 2x works (i.e. 16bytes).
[00:14:40] <Alipha> when i say "progressively create blocks ending in 0x01 ..." i don't actually mean 0x01 as the last byte in what you send to the server. if you read about how to do a padding oracle attack, it'll explain how to arrange to create a ciphertext block where the last byte of the *plaintext* is 0x01
[00:15:27] <srmo> Alipha, yes, I'm following https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/ but it doesn't say anything about the blocksize. Maybe I need to get more sleep and a primer on block ciphers :)
[00:15:54] <ms7821> that lil diagram about how CBC mode works is the key
[00:16:04] <Alipha> srmo: sounds like it's 16 bytes if your 8-byte experiment failed
[00:16:12] <Alipha> (or you did the experiment wrong ;-))
[00:16:24] <srmo> :D  me? Never!
[00:16:27] <rqsd> (or they use an obscure block cipher with some absurd block size because CTF logic)
[00:16:50] <srmo> I hop enot. It's actually a very beginner friendly ctf (overthewire, natas wargame)
[00:17:07] <srmo> At least the initial stage(s)
[00:18:09] <srmo> I'll take a break and then try some code to automate the padding attack. Thank you folks for holding hands!
[00:18:42] <srmo> right now I'm just mashing bash with xxd, cat and base64 
[00:19:40] <Alipha> srmo: yeah, i would definitely automate it because you have to send {256 * length_of_ciphertext_in_bytes} requests
[00:20:23] <Alipha> {256 * (length_of_ciphertext_in_bytes - 16)} actually
[00:20:52] <Alipha> well, i guess on average it would be half that

[02:13:07] <Hash> Symmetric Cryptography and Hashes = 44% of exam
[02:14:22] <ericonr> I mean, what else would you teach in an intro to crypto class?
[02:15:54] <ericonr> Introducing and studying basic word ciphers helps set a student's frame of mind to the idea of permutations and substitutions and whatever being valid methods of encrypting information
[02:16:06] <ericonr> Just throwing numbers at people won't really achieve anything :p
[02:16:07] <ms7821> I wouldn't bother with anything about blowfish, twofish and skipjack
[02:16:41] <ms7821> and you only need to cover one or two manual ciphers instead of a dozen
[02:16:54] <ericonr> Fair, that is a lot
[02:17:19] <Hash> Educators and professionals think otherwise.
[02:18:06] <ericonr> ms7821: i don't know anything about twofish and skipjack, but blowfish seems interesting in that I have seen many complaints about it but it seems to be the preferred cipher for passwords on unix
[02:18:57] <ms7821> it's a bit of a toy these days
[02:20:17] <ms7821> and bcrypt is preferred for some *nix these days
[02:22:14] <ms7821> also all of the modes can be replaced with a slide saying "don't, use aead instead"
[02:23:05] <ericonr> Right, but a crypto class isn't about application of crypto as it is about understanding it. Understanding what the others do wrong takes studying them, at least a bit
