[01:24:05] <kuudes> "My best guess is that the generation time of Omicron is lower than we thought, which means R0 is lower, which means that it’s easier (but still hard, and long term still probably not feasible or advisable) to take enough action to slow it down." is zvi behind times?
[01:24:45] <kuudes> omicron generation time is less than 2.5 days it seems and its R is maybe 4 instead of 20, but this was (my) prior already a week or two ago?
[01:24:48] <galambo> which means that those publications were trying to imply that not only is the lab leak theory a conspiracy theory, but you are also a racist for considering it

[01:34:35] <kuudes> oh, he cites stuff from 2021-12-15 so he indeed is out of loop
[01:38:57] <kuudes> he mentions the nsw thing, which seemt to focus on only the tail; over there the hospitalization reduction effect in the charts referred seems to my eyes start much earlier and correspond to vaccinations becoming saturated over there to around 80% or so
[01:39:49] <kuudes> so nsw would be explained maybe better by vaccination protection against infection growing weaker but still sustaining protection against hospitalization, thereby driving hospitalization/case ratio down
[01:40:07] <kuudes> imo the lowering effect starts from between october and november

All of these town hall meetings had the same dynamic: The parliamentarian goes up and talks about democracy and how the constitution should be structured ...

[11:36:32] <feep> like, that's how the eu works, the common threat is "one of our members decides to go crazy and attack its neighbors"
[11:37:19] <feep> I think you're viewing this from a great power framework when it makes more sense in a patchwork of empires way
[11:45:57] <saturn2> and by "go crazy" you mean "try to take more power"
[11:46:59] <saturn2> "security architecture" is the polite term for dominance hierarchy
[11:49:17] <Obormot\Gaia> feep: And that makes perfect sense if you're Czechia, or Spain, or Poland
[11:49:23] <Obormot\Gaia> feep: How does it make sense if you're Russia?
[11:50:02] <Obormot\Gaia> feep: One day France decides to invade you and you have to rely on Germany and Denmark and Finland to protect you?
[11:50:12] <Obormot\Gaia> This is obviously complete nonsense in the 21st century
[11:51:02] <nshepperd2> presumably that's why russia remains  outside of and opposed to a common European security architecture
[11:51:10] <Obormot\Gaia> Indeed
[11:51:21] <nshepperd2> because they don't think they need the protection of the eu dominance hierarchy
[11:51:48] <Obormot\Gaia> Not only do they not need the protection of said hierarchy, but *they are precisely who the rest of the hierarchy needs each other's protection from*
[11:52:24] <Obormot\Gaia> Let's be realistic: if you're Poland, who's a bigger threat to you? Today? Germany? Or Russia?
[11:52:37] <Obormot\Gaia> France... or Russia?
[11:52:46] <Obormot\Gaia> Norway... or...?
[11:53:24] <Obormot\Gaia> Russia participating in a "common EU security architecture" runs *directly counter to all of Russia's goals*
[11:55:12] <feep> so we're all on the page of "russia just wants to reunite the eastern bloc"?
[11:55:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Ehhh
[11:55:33] <feep> like, just ignoring the "oh no nato may attack us" rhetoric
[11:55:59] <Obormot\Gaia> Let's take a crazy hypothetical for a moment
[11:56:16] <Obormot\Gaia> What if Russia just up and annexed a chunk of a neighboring country all of a sudden
[11:56:23] <Obormot\Gaia> Would NATO attack them
[11:57:11] <feep> I mean, it depends what country, right?
[11:57:24] <feep> so far, clearly the answer is no, since they've already done it
[11:57:33] <feep> like twice
[11:57:57] <Obormot\Gaia> Indeed, that was the point, and the further point is "NATO may attack us" is not really the rhetoric anymore
[11:58:42] <Obormot\Gaia> There are other pretexts for territorial expansion... there's never a shortage of those, really
[11:59:03] <Obormot\Gaia> The bottom line is that Russia has nothing to gain from entering into any "common European security architecture"
[11:59:05] <Obormot\Gaia> Nothing at all
[11:59:19] <feep> right, but offering it publically may still be the right move
[11:59:24] <feep> even offer a lot of concessions
[11:59:42] <feep> to create a rift between russia's rhetoric and behavior
[11:59:48] <Obormot\Gaia> In whose mind

[12:00:39] <Obormot\Gaia> I don't think anyone in NATO is convinced by Russia's rhetoric, even the broad normies

[12:01:02] <feep> the german left party has called for a removal of russian sanctions
[12:01:09] <feep> don't overestimate normies :p
