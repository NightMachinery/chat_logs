[00:00:29] <dtminus> You have to authenticate somehow, entering credentials via http is deprecated for github.
[00:02:05] <Guest378> and that defines the very point of my question. Is there a way, that i can boot up on a live system, clone my repository in cli, work on it, and then committing changes in the cli

[00:07:32] <imMute> you could use a git host that allow password authentication
[00:07:52] <imMute> (all those things listed can be done without authentication, FWIW.  just pushing requires auth)

[00:08:08] <Guest378> oaky, got it.
[00:09:13] <dtminus> Just out of interest, why does it have to be on a live system?
[00:09:57] <imMute> also, for SSH auth,  you don't make github trust your live system.  you give your public key to github and github trusts anyone who has the corresponding private key.
[00:10:39] *** Joins: digilink (~digilink@user/digilink)
[00:11:36] <Guest378> a shell script running after boot in the live system could setup the SSH auth, right:?

[00:12:08] <dtminus> If you copy a script to the live system you might as well just copy the ssh private key

[00:13:30] <Guest378> so i wanna use GPG keys instead?
[00:13:58] <mackerman> git  push, the transport, is not using GPG
[00:14:18] <imMute> Guest378: I don't know of any git hosting that can use GPG

[00:15:44] <ikke> It's very simple, you either need a trusted ssh key, or an app token
[00:17:40] <Guest378> on a live system, because it could be awesome to just have a usb flash drive, boot live on any random host, work, poweroff and leave without any trace on that host
[00:17:48] <Guest378> could be any public host like library or what ever
[00:19:00] <imMute> Guest378: live systems like that typically have the ability to have a "persistent" storage.  sometimes even the user's home dir.   put your config in there.
[00:20:02] <Guest378> persistent is very slow in my experience, because that'd have to be encrypted
[00:20:22] <imMute> it doesn't *have* to be encrypted. that's optional.
[00:20:38] <imMute> and for the use case you mentioned, you really should have a persistent area
[00:20:41] <Guest378> booting 15 seconds and be ready to work instant is awesome
[00:20:44] <dtminus> tbh it kind of sounds like a laptop is the ideal solution for that use case
[00:21:04] <imMute> dtminus: laptops are orders of magnitude more expensive than a USB flash drive
[00:21:16] <Guest378> xD
[00:21:48] <dtminus> True, but I doubt you'd be able to just boot any old system from a flash drive at a public computer. At least if they're set up right
[00:22:37] <imMute> true, but that's just one example.  I try not to question the "why" of what someone wants to accomplish (as long as its not insane)
[00:23:07] <Guest378> i mean, just have a drive like this: https://www.kingston.com/unitedstates/en/usb-flash-drives/datatraveler-micro-3-1-usb-flash-drive
[00:23:53] <Guest378> you can, With Peppermint OS
[00:24:18] <Guest378> it's lightweight as hell, and runs on just about anything without getting sluggy in performance
[00:24:48] <Guest378> remember asus Eee pc's, with windows XP?
[00:25:03] <Guest378> im running peppermint OS on that, via an SD-card.
[00:25:24] <Guest378> no harddrive, only live boot works.

[06:59:28] <imMute> man gitrevisions: A suffix ^ followed by an empty brace pair means the object could be a tag, and dereference the tag recursively until a non-tag object is found.
[06:59:28] <gitinfo> the gitrevisions manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/gitrevisions.html
[07:03:39] <sudoforge> imMute: what's really strange is rm -rf'ing it and re-cloning doesn't pull those revisions down
[07:05:38] <imMute> odd. mine didn't clone them eith
[07:07:06] <imMute> must be something weird with the git server that github implements
[07:07:10] <sudoforge> yeah, pretty strange
[07:07:25] <sudoforge> i also didn't seem them as unique tags -- eg i had v1.0.0 and v1.0.0^{}

[12:56:06] <Antz> I made a mess of my project on Github and I need help to fix it up. Can anyone help?
[12:56:48] <Antz> It's just a little question that I have...
[12:58:05] <farn> If you ask it, someone might answer
[13:00:17] <Antz> I forked an Open Source project and started making changes on my fork. Then after four commits I have wanted to make a pull request from the upstream project for the first and third commit. At that stage I realised that I should be making every change on separate branches so I can make a pull request containing only the differences in those
[13:00:18] <Antz> branches. So I reverted each of the four commits from the master, and now it shows I am 8 commits ahead of the upstream branch, but there are no differences. I'd like it to be equal with the upstream branch as though it had just been freshly forked.
[13:00:26] <Antz> This is on Github.

[23:22:45] <codebam> how do I show all the file names that were changed between HEAD and a commit hash?
