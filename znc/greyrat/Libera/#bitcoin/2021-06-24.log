[01:18:28] <Evolver> how many bitcoin did McAfee take to the grave...
[01:19:09] <Evolver> Also, can taproot allow me to write a smart contract to transfer my Bitcoin to another address if the source has no spends for say 10 years?

[01:25:51] <earnestly> Evolver: iiuic it would probably be a transaction that becomes spendable in 10 years, so the funds are locked up until that condition is met (and some other condition that allows you to spend it whenever)
[01:26:07] <earnestly> (Rather than something that initiates a transaction)
[01:26:24] *** Quits: ElectricBill (~FlipBill@smtpv5.cosi.net) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[01:27:20] <Evolver> earnestly: How can I structure a smart contract to assign a beneficiary in any possible way? I want the bitcoin to automatically be transferred if a certain condition is met
[01:27:38] <Evolver> whatever the balance is.
[01:28:18] <earnestly> That seems easier to do by just giving them the wallet
[01:29:03] <Evolver> so they will take it and spend it right now
[01:29:08] <Evolver> while I'm still here
[01:29:37] <earnestly> Not a very good beneficiary
[01:29:53] <Evolver> well ok let's say my beneficiary is partly a charity
[01:30:08] <earnestly> ew
[01:30:23] <Evolver> so ofc I can't give my wallet to the charity in advance
[01:30:24] <earnestly> But otherwise I don't know
[01:30:30] <earnestly> Those details
[01:30:51] <belcher> Evolver depends what conditions
[01:31:05] <earnestly> belcher: '10 years of no activity'
[01:31:06] <belcher> you can have the funds effectively transferred after a certain date if unspent, using nlocktime
[01:31:08] <Evolver> belcher: just that the wallet doesn't have any spends for a certain time, e.g. 10 years
[01:31:10] <belcher> then use nlocktime
[01:31:11] <Evolver> ok
[01:31:28] <earnestly> belcher: Does that actually intiate the transaction?
[01:31:42] <Evolver> Also, is this facilitated by the recent taproot change, or has it previously been possible?
[01:31:55] <Evolver> I mean at a reasonable cost.
[01:31:59] <belcher> you create a signed transaction sending the coins to the charity, the transaction has the nlocktime value set with a value corresponding to the year 2031, the transaction is valid except for the nlocktime, when the year 2031 happens then the charity broadcasts that transaction
[01:32:11] <belcher> but in the meantime if you spend that UTXO then the transaction will become invalid
[01:32:27] <belcher> taproot doesnt change this, it has been possible since the start of bitcoin iirc
[01:32:28] <earnestly> Evolver: Looks old
[01:32:43] <earnestly> https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki
[01:32:49] <earnestly> 2014?
[01:33:12] <belcher> earnestly bip65 is different
[01:33:22] <Evolver> Ideally I don't want to define the exact amount, just whatever remains in my wallet.
[01:33:41] <belcher> what you would do is create the pre-signed transaction every time you make a transaction with your wallet
[01:33:47] <earnestly> belcher: Well it's the ability to check, which I thought might be necessary
[01:34:03] <belcher> what ability to check?
[01:34:10] <earnestly> If it is invalid or not
[01:34:21] <belcher> bip65 is orthogonal to that
[01:35:08] <earnestly> Hm, fair enough

[18:41:02] <earnestly> I don't know what that is yet
[18:41:38] <glix> lets say I recieved coins that I might think be 'tainted'. I can make a transaction with that being one of the inputs with several others and also have multiple outputs that all I control..
[18:42:34] <glix> earnestly: by that I just mean being able to spend your coins in a way you like. I don't know if coincontrol is the right term for that..
[18:42:41] <earnestly> > With Coin Control, you can simply choose to not use this tiny Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO).
[18:42:42] <belcher> glix right but later you'll presumably spend those 10 utxos together or at least on similar things related to your identity and behaviour
[18:42:51] *** Quits: Klotz (~Klotzoman@gateway/tor-sasl/klotz) (Quit: Klotz)
[18:42:57] <belcher> if instead the 10 utxos were owned by different actual people, they will spend them likely on totally different stuff
[18:43:21] <belcher> e.g. one of the 10 might send them to a bitcoin casino, another might spend them with a nigeria otc trader, yet another with an american bitcoin atm, yet another on an anonymous vpn, etc

[18:44:30] <belcher> maybe you're already aware but if you're interested in privacy have a read of this page https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy
[18:46:13] <glix> belcher: yeah read some of it before, will read more
[18:46:39] <belcher> but thats a good question, on "why not just make fake coinjoins"
[18:51:48] <glix> belcher: yeah, what do you think? I suppose it does achieve "some" amount of privacy, right? If coinjoin with several other strangers is one of the extremes then doing simple fake coinjoins with yourself should also be a little better than just doing normal txns
[18:52:10] <belcher> i guess yeah
[18:52:22] <belcher> but doing coinjoins with other people is fairly easy today, theres at least 3 implementations
[18:52:30] <belcher> i dont know of any wallet that creates fake coinjoins today
[18:52:50] <belcher> id guess no dev worked on creating fake coinjoins because they're a bit rubbish, and you may as well spend you time on proper coinjoins with other people
[18:53:58] <glix> belcher: well can't I just do some coin control using electrum and use it's 'pay to multiple addresses' feature and pay an equal amount to the addresses I control?
[18:54:41] <belcher> yeah you could, though to genuinely pretend to be a coinjoin you need multiple inputs too
[18:55:01] <belcher> also worth noting, real coinjoins are directly touching other coinjoins on the blockchain, because most people create multiple coinjoins
[18:55:12] <darosior> They do exist, my channel openings are often tagged as CJs as there are multiple channel opens for the same value in the same transaction
[18:55:31] <belcher> so if an analyst sees a single "coinjoin" on the blockchain where all the inputs and outputs are not coinjoins then that could be evidence that its fake

[18:57:27] <belcher> theres a couple of academic papers out there which detect joinmarket coinjoins using the "touching other coinjoins" heuristic
[18:57:51] <darosior> This makes sense
[18:57:54] <belcher> the transaction has to be 1) equal outputs, with inputs numbering not less than the number of equal outputs, and 2) touching a big mass of other such coinjoins
[18:58:22] <belcher> it seems like the same idea would work for wasabi and samourai, they also have users creating multiple coinjoins
[18:58:41] <darosior> But then a small amount of false positive could screw the entire heuristic

[19:00:21] <darosior> With equal-value outputs

[19:07:30] <belcher> using coinjoin in itself is not a reason for them to just steal your coins, you could probably sue them for that
[19:08:19] <belcher> but yes its much better to use p2p exchanges like bisq (full list https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) which is much more resistant to having your coins stolen because you used coinjoin
