[02:24:02] <chilversc> Are there any decent alternatives to mdadm that support both extended attributes and bmap? I looked at zfs and btrfs but it seems that neither of them support bmap.
[02:24:35] <chilversc> I'm uncertain of lvm, as it seems lvm with raid0 just uses the md driver?

[02:25:00] <chilversc> no, I just need to stripe data across multiple volumes, between about 4 and 24 volumes
[02:25:07] <ramblebamble> Tach, so you want a container to be deployed inside a VM that is owned by the user anyways, and then restrict the movement of the owner by putting them inside a container and chrooting them inside the container

[02:45:39] <kfrench> yoink
[02:45:55] <SaltHillStroller> Is there some functionality where fread will not read after receiving an EOF / 0? Tldr I have a userspace daemon polling fread on a device file. At startup, fread invokes the driver and returns the data. Once it reads all the data the driver returns 0. However, when there is new data the driver is not getting invoked. So that's my question really. When fread receives a 0, will that prevent the file from being read again?
[02:46:01] <mitchxv2> But I will say, even 10 years ago I found that introducing low skill users to ubuntu almost ALWAYS ended their issues with their computer. 90% of the time it was due to bogging down their system with nonsense programs and toolbars, and for some reason Ubuntu worked very well with them

[03:01:39] <SaltHillStroller> If fread requests 1000 bytes on a device file, and the read handler returns say 512. Does fread block until the driver returns the remaining bytes?
[03:01:51] <mitchxv2> @Linkandzelda - I agree - It's terrible -- especially when you are dealing with ERP systems, the added lag from the weight of the interface makes everything take so long, and the abstraction from the source code and source data that you see with SaaS programs is a real problem
[03:01:52] <Two_Dogs> kristian_on_linu, try google-spreadsheet yet? just for test purpose, just wondering which comes closer to MS
[03:01:52] <znf> ie: a 120GB SSD will most of the time actually have 128GB (or less, it varies), but those 8GB are reserved for internal operations, like replacing bad/faulty sectors :)

[03:26:32] <Elw3> You guys make no sense whatsoever.
[03:26:46] <ablyss> usb on my system i think is right around 40/mbs where sdd is like 1gig a second
[03:26:57] <kristian_on_linu> Intelo, I don't know your setup, but a traditional solution is to put the OS on an SSD and keep the HDD for data
[03:27:04] <mitchxv2> When you say USB do you mean a USB Flash Drive or USB vs SATA
[03:27:29] <Intelo> Two_Dogs,  oerheks  kristian_on_linu  ok there may be many other factors as well like version and brand but generally speaking, how much faster would be ssd than usb roughly? twice?
[03:27:33] <Sauvin> Elw3, the controller for a USB is on a bus shared with other devices. Trust me, it can be slower than frozen dog poop.
[03:27:37] <Intelo> Elw3,  really?
[03:27:48] <Elw3> flashdrives are ssds too
[03:27:53] <Intelo> Elw3,  so both are same?

[03:27:56] <rcf> It can be slower, but not necessarily so.
[03:27:57] <eharmonic> doesn't seem to be any noticeable difference in speed between internal sd card and attached usb sd frive

[03:28:11] <kristian_on_linu> in the eyes of the Lord, we are all flash drives

[03:28:55] <Intelo> Two_Dogs,  save what?
[03:29:04] <Intelo> mitchxv2,  ok but how much is it slower?
[03:29:16] <Intelo> I just wanted a general idea

[03:29:40] <rcf> Intelo: flash drives are extremely variable, some are almost OK, others are basically dial-up when it comes to writes.

[03:29:45] <Elw3> The bottleneckw is whenever something reads and writes at the same time, then SD cards and flashdrives will stall completely unlike anything connected via SATA
[03:29:46] <Intelo> it
[03:29:59] <mitchxv2> thats just his experience I dont know the specifics but if you want the best performance out of a drive i'd say u want to use SATA or NVME interface instead of USB

[03:32:22] <omegatron> Intelo: I tried installing + running 5.16.2 linux on a usb pen drive two weeks ago (just for fun .. while installing was no problem, working with it is a pain in the ass - the random accesses slow it down)
[03:32:25] <Intelo> mitchxv2,  ok any specific command with dd that shows write speed on a /tmp?
[03:32:35] <omegatron> so, don't do it
[03:32:37] <mitchxv2> bro ur not gonna believe this but in my fake world test I made a language easier than html faster than c and it cracked all encryption but i just cant get it to work like I imagined

[05:26:14] <rascul> perhaps you forgot to set --prefix?

[08:54:29] <ball> drkshadow: That's nothing like networking over SAS

[08:55:09] <ball> drkshadow: you just run something like an iSCSI terminator (for block) or NFS or Samba (for file) storage
[08:55:11] <drkshadow> ayecee: then what does the SAN use as its hardware? I wouldn't think it's especially special. I would expect it to work both ways.

[09:02:18] <drkshadow> something's still not right. The method to do multi-pathing between SAN heads has you connect the heads together via SAS cable. Not just the disks, the hosts are connected via SAS. If cable A fails, it will connect to the disks through the host-link and cable B.

Typically by that SAS cable between them, as there's no other performant connectivity. They are physically separate computers.

[14:45:26] <frost-core> do i have to install another plymouth theme then remove it?
[14:45:46] <alkisg> No, get the source code of one theme, modify it, then package it into a .deb

[19:43:33] <Lebela> hexnewbie, sorry, I didn't mean to be rude with "for real!?",  I was only genuinely shocked
[19:43:37] <Lebela> usually, Linux always has a way

[19:44:25] <hexnewbie> Lebela: As for a way, on some filesystems, a filesystem debugger can change it. On others, you can set your system clock to the given time, and change or create the file

[19:46:12] <Lebela> my bash script calulates the timelapse speed of timelapse videos
[19:46:13] <hexnewbie> Lebela: But generally, the birth and change time are written by the filesystem, whenever the file was created or its metadata modified, and aren't changeable (and wouldn't become changeable, for security reasons, I suspect)
[19:46:23] <Lebela> if they were taken at 4x or 10x or 15x speed and so on
[19:46:43] <ayecee> well but also there's no function available to change it
[19:46:53] <Lebela> what I am doing it:  I take the end of the recording time and subtract the beginning and divide it by the length
[19:47:00] *** Quits: jaggz (~jaggz@user/jaggz) (Quit: I saith goodbye)
[19:47:05] <hexnewbie> Your bash script wouldn't need the birth time (which 101% wrong for copied files), or change time (same, plus gets wronger with time)
[19:47:07] <Lebela> currently, I use the "modified" date to find out when the recording started
[19:47:18] <Lebela> but I wonder, why it is the "modified" date and not the "birth" date?
[19:47:24] <Lebela> or the "created" date?
[19:47:35] <Lebela> the one date that _really_ represents the beginning of the recording is the "modified" date

[19:50:39] <Lebela> ooooooooh yes!
[19:50:42] <hexnewbie> Lebela: The modified time is metadata that can concern the file (original) or data of said file (as it gets copied along with it), the other two are metadata solely for the given inode, i.e. copy of the file

[21:48:23] <SectorError> tsc isn't depended on anymore as a reliable clock source, so it should switch to acpi or hped or similar
[21:48:40] <ayecee> there should be a pit clock source too, normally.
[21:49:01] <ayecee> yeah, using hpet is typical now. has higher resolution for one.
[21:49:30] <ayecee> but if your system doesn't have one, that doesn't help ;)

[21:50:33] <shibboleth> i remember hpet being an option back when compiling kernel 2.2

[22:41:00] <Tangent-Man> I installed networkmanager on my Arch system then I got an Icon in the system tray that enabled me to setup a wifi hotpoint...

[23:21:36] <akik> hexnewbie: you haven't lived until you've seen that

[23:21:58] <ayecee> MrElendig: sure, and it's basically the same operation.
[23:22:03] <hexnewbie> rename("dir1", "/home/user/junk/dir4") is faster than hardlinking anything

[23:23:02] <ayecee> ok slightly faster because the hardlink and the unlink happen as one operation
[23:23:04] <hexnewbie> Since directories cannot be hardlinked, harlinking every individual file inside (your only hardlink option) will be way slower than 'mv'
