[00:02:07] <dereksgc[m]> hello, I have been having issues with the PLL Carrier Tracking block in GRC, specifically that it isn't tracking the carrier 
[00:02:42] <dereksgc[m]> to test whether I'm going crazy or not I loaded my wav file into an old flowchart that I know worked and it doesn't anymore
[00:02:59] * dereksgc[m] uploaded an image: (111KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/gnuradio.org/0e0a2ef0318e74afac21601b64aecc9e30e84a0f/image.png >
[00:03:35] <dereksgc[m]> it's gr 3.9.2.0 (Python 3.9.7)
[00:13:07] <dereksgc[m]> ok so it seems like I was too quick to jump to conclusions, I tried loading a different wav file and there the PLL block does lock on the carrier

[14:52:32] <rodrirq[m]> Hello, could someone point me which are the smallest  SDRs that work with GNU Radio for both tx/rx?
[14:52:35] <Yamakaja[m]> The pluto maybe?
[14:52:41] <Yamakaja[m]> Smallest as in physically?
[14:52:53] <rodrirq[m]> Yes, physical dimensions
[14:52:57] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh
[14:53:01] <Myon> limesdr mini
[14:53:07] <Yamakaja[m]> Maybe one of the smaller limesdrs?
[14:53:11] <rodrirq[m]> I have worked with the LimeSDR-Mini, but I was wondering if there was a smaller one
[14:53:22] <Myon> I think they made a micro in the meantime
[14:53:39] <LordKalma> limesdr-mini definitely is as small you can get afaik
[14:54:09] <Myon> why? (being curious)
[14:54:14] <rodrirq[m]> I see...
[14:54:41] <Yamakaja[m]> There's also this https://epiqsolutions.com/rf-transceiver/sidekiq/
[14:54:49] <rodrirq[m]> Myon: It is supposed to be in a cube of 87mm of length
[14:54:53] <Yamakaja[m]> Not sure if smaller, but also nice formfactor
[14:54:59] <rodrirq[m]> and with the USB and SMAs, it is about 94 mm
[14:55:00] <Yamakaja[m]> * but also a nice formfactor
[14:55:12] <rodrirq[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I'll check, thanks!
[14:55:14] <Myon> oh that will be hard with a USB connector (or any connector)
[14:55:20] <Yamakaja[m]> That Sidekiq is 51 mm long
[14:55:30] <LordKalma> rodrirq[m] you can swap out the connectors if you can solder :p
[14:55:31] <rodrirq[m]> Myon: that's right
[14:55:46] <LordKalma> but that said, yeah, like, you can't get much smaller than the lime.mini
[14:55:52] <LordKalma> you can play with the shape, but more or less the same area
[14:56:14] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh wait, Sidekiq M.2 is even smaller (Down on the page i linked) at 42 mm
[14:56:15] <LordKalma> it's pretty dense... the RF IC, the uC, and the necessary circuitry are all pretty packed already 
[14:57:04] <LordKalma> I wonder if there's a version of the mini with U.FL and micro-usb instead of A
[14:57:25] <rodrirq[m]> LordKalma: Yes, but then I would need to characterize the board
[14:57:30] <rodrirq[m]> It is not that easy, I think
[14:57:32] <LordKalma> [rant] WHY WHY WHY do they put USB-A on the lime-mini?! do they expect me to have that hanging from a USB port? with that much torque?!
[14:57:52] <LordKalma> I hate USB-A on dongles
[14:57:58] <rodrirq[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I am looking at them, but I hadn't seen that kind of connector
[14:58:11] <LordKalma> anything larger than a thumb drive shouldn't have USB-A
[14:58:15] <Yamakaja[m]> rodrirq: What's your base board?
[14:58:26] <Yamakaja[m]> Is this for a satellite application?
[14:58:28] <rodrirq[m]> The thing is, would that SDR work with GNU Radio
[14:58:30] <LordKalma> rodrirq[m] that's PCIe (same as graphics cards, for example, but shorter) or M.2 (same as high-performance SSDs)
[14:58:33] <rodrirq[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Yes it is
[14:58:41] <Yamakaja[m]> Neat
[14:58:43] <rodrirq[m]> Right now I am working with the Zybo Z7-10
[14:58:47] <Myon> https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limenet-micro is a complete computer it seems (125x65mm)
[14:58:48] <Yamakaja[m]> Pretty sure, they've sponsored GRCon before
[14:58:56] <rodrirq[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I will check
[14:59:14] <LordKalma> 87mm is ambicious...
[14:59:28] <LordKalma> but what connectivity options do you have? the 87mm box will have a USB plug?
[15:01:38] <Yamakaja[m]> Mhm, are you going to be building your own base board?
[15:01:54] <Yamakaja[m]> If yes, the Z-7015 does support Gen 2x4
[15:03:06] <LordKalma> IP blocks for PCIe are expensive
[15:03:26] <LordKalma> *very* expensive. I hope you have a bit wallet :D

[15:21:24] <rodrirq[m]> So i am looking for a PCIe Gen 2 to USB adapter
[15:21:34] <rodrirq[m]> Or PCIe Gen 1.1
[15:21:47] <rodrirq[m]> Both versions of that SDR are good for me
[15:24:32] <Yamakaja[m]> PCIe to USB sounds like trouble
[15:24:47] <Yamakaja[m]> (Assuming we're not talking about USB 4)
[15:24:56] <rodrirq[m]> Yes, it is trouble
[15:25:07] <rodrirq[m]> Yep, I need USB 3.0
[15:25:23] <Myon> the xtrx is very small: Form Factor: full-size Mini PCIe (30 × 51 mm)
[15:25:30] <Myon> but afaict it's dead or something
[15:28:21] <Yamakaja[m]> rodrirq: So, do you plan on building a bustom base board or are you going to send the Zybo into space?
[15:28:26] <Yamakaja[m]> s/bustom/custom/
[15:28:46] <rodrirq[m]> Yamakaja[m]: It will be a custom one
[15:29:54] <Yamakaja[m]> I see, so then i suppose the PCIe option isn't completely off the table? the PCIe IP from Xilinx is free (https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/7_series_pci_express_block.html)
[15:30:18] <Yamakaja[m]> You "just" need to get it hooked up to the PS, though that might not be very straight forward
[15:30:56] <Yamakaja[m]> Alternatively if you're building your own board anyways have you thought of just putting an AD9361 on your board? The pluto designs are open source
[15:31:02] <Yamakaja[m]> * board anyways, have
[15:31:36] <Yamakaja[m]> You'd need to do some RF trace layout, but it would certainly be compact
[15:33:49] <Yamakaja[m]> You could base most of the HDL and software on the pluto design, all of that is open source aswell
[15:38:19] <rodrirq[m]> I will check the options you told me and I will discuss it with my partner
[15:38:54] <rodrirq[m]> Thanks for the info, unfortunately, I am not familiar with PCIe nor the AD9361

[19:52:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> Me, I want to see a brutally-coherent, easily-stackable SDR with modest bandwidths (20MHz?) that maybe doesn't even have its own synthesizer on-board, but has attention-paid-to-detail external LO input, with a 1GBe interface, and perhaps only 10 times pricier than an RTL-SDR.   I also want $1M and a life-partner who adores me.  SURELY, the radio is easier :) :) :)
[19:53:45] <drmpeg> Is $1M enough these days?
[19:54:14] <Myon> if you are only spending it on rtlsdr-type radios, yes

[20:13:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> Many-bits not necessary either.
[20:15:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> I sketched out part of a design a while ago using ADL5380 for a mixer, and MAX1192 for 8-bit ADCs.   I only care about RX (for radio astronomy, of course!).
[20:16:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> That won't work below somewhere around 400MHz, but that might be acceptable.
[20:16:32] <Myon> https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr/updates/announcing-limesdr-mini-2-0 sounds better (that just hit my inbox)
[20:17:39] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun: killjoys these guys ;)
[20:19:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> But TBH, I simply don' thave the skills to bring such a thing onto the market.  So I remain optimistic that someone else might do this at some point.  
[20:23:26] <LordKalma> you want hackrf but good
[20:23:27] * LordKalma runs
[20:24:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> I don't need TX, and "brutal coherence" requires some attention to detail that HackRF, and many others don't have.
[20:28:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> Frac-N synthesizers suck in this regard, as do 2XLO mixers.   Then there's the "how do I synchronize the streams, even if they originate coherently at the analog layer?"

[22:37:47] <n1ai[m]> Nobody needs more than 48k?
[22:38:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> I'm absolutely NOT impllying that other folks might want other things from SDRs.  Larger tuning ranges, bigger sample sizes, higher sample rates, etc, etc.
[22:40:04] <n1ai[m]> Yes, I understand. It is just very hard to find common ground, isn't it?
[22:40:44] <n1ai[m]> Same with relationships, lol!
[22:40:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yes.  MOST SDR manufacturers target their hardware at commercial applications in the telecom and defence space.
[22:41:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> And the ones that are targetted at the hobby market lack crucial features.
[22:41:44] *** Joins: __alex (~alex@ip5f5be2d7.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[22:42:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> The "brutal coherence' requirement is something that isn't actually required by many commercial applications, so nobody really works that hard on it.  The key, as far as I can tell, is to vastly simplify things...
[22:43:27] <tnt> patchvonbraun[m]: the "10-times pricier" than a rtl-sdr just kills out right out the gate.
[22:56:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> tnt: I dunno, HackRF is in the ballpark, cost-wise.  Ditch the TX bits, and the synthesizers, and pay more attention to shared clocking and a shared trigger or 1PPS or something....

[23:09:40] <tnt> patchvonbraun[m]: hackrf had it's whole dev cycle sponsored. It also uses highly integrated parts that wouldn't be suitable to your requirements. I don't see any viable sdr hw for less than 1k. (and by viable, I mean recup dev costs and provide enough margin to have a correct sw stack that's maintained over time without having to work for free).

[23:16:48] <tnt> it also uses double conversion to use a cheap chipset-set meant for wifi/bluetooth.
[23:17:45] <tnt> (err, wimax actually ...)
[23:19:57] <tnt> It's also missing "serious sdr" features like hw timestamping IIRC.   Not sure if the hw could do it. it probably can, but I'd suspect they just don't have budget to invest in developping new advanced features.

[23:32:00] <bpadalino> patchvonbraun[m]: would a slightly modified pluto design work?
[23:33:31] <bpadalino> i guess that doesn't include the lower end of the band you want
[23:34:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> bpadalino: The AD936x is too expensive and doesn't really support "brutal coherence" because the synthesizers don't really cut the mustard.
[23:34:44] <bpadalino> patchvonbraun[m]: even with the 2xLO external input ?
[23:34:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> I'm willing to give up HF support.  There's very little synthetic aperture radio astronomy below 400MHz
[23:35:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> bpadalino: I think the external 2XLO is only in AD937x series?  Also, there's a 180deg phase ambiguity due to the mixers.
[23:35:41] <bpadalino> oh huh .. maybe
[23:35:57] <bpadalino> for some reason i thought external LO was a thing on the 936x
[23:36:26] <funkylab[m]> so you basically want to not have an AFE integrating the synthesizer and mixer
[23:36:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> Really, if you stripped out all the RF goop on a HackRF, and put in something like the ADL5380, and did a few firmware mods to allow trriggered sampling....
[23:36:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> funkylab: Indeed.
[23:37:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> funkylab: With modern frac-N synthesis and 2XLO mixers, you have a world of pain....
[23:37:31] <funkylab[m]> Basically, any usrp2 device with a modified dboard that takes an external LO, right?
[23:38:00] <funkylab[m]> ah no you don't get the brutally coherent sampling
[23:38:08] <funkylab[m]> hm.
[23:38:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> funkylab:  USRP2/N2xx has what you want--it takes 1PPS and external REF.   
[23:38:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> It has 1GIGe
[23:39:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> But it also has lots of extra hardware for the TX side, and, well, NI markups...
[23:41:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> A card that's the moral equivalent of a LFRX with a built-in mixer could probably work.    There are some "hums and hahs" about the behavjor of the DDC machinery with respect to all of them starting at the same phase offset.
[23:41:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> I don't remember whether the USRP2 FPGA family does that "properly" for this case.
[23:43:13] <funkylab[m]> IIRC yes
[23:43:35] <bpadalino> being able to build up the coherency sounds interesting .. something like a JESD204 SYSREF along with a regular REFCLK
[23:43:40] <funkylab[m]> just like series3, there's no way to reset the NCO phase once it's started, so be sure to not issue a tuning command that might touch the DDC before setting a command time
[23:43:52] <bpadalino> then you have a composable system of N coherent receive chains
[23:44:25] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Seriously, I think we *are* supposed to write app notes
[23:44:45] <funkylab[m]> what about a my-first-little-custom-dboard app note?
