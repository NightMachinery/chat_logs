[01:17:53] <JakeSays> so i had some code that manually incremented a ref count before passing an object over a messaging mechanism. boss said manually tweaking ref count is bad so he replaced it with a new/delete. new/delete not only manually tweaks the refcount, it introduces a naked pointer.
[01:20:51] <jonp> sometimes the "bad idea" is still the best available option
[01:20:58] <JakeSays> yup

[01:26:14] <jonp> was talking about manually changing a ref count…
[01:37:24] <teegee> I'm writing a task queue / processor that can take arbitrary work items as actions. having difficulties supporting regular and async actions. Here's a fiddle: https://dotnetfiddle.net/MVcF5d run it and notice that the task.delay isn't actually delaying. How can I fix that?

[01:45:53] <jonp> teegee: in order for Task.Delay() to actually delay, you need to `await` the return value
[01:46:05] <jonp> and while you *appear* to do so: `async (ms) => await Task.Delay(ms)`
[01:46:09] <jonp> you're not actually doing so
[01:46:17] <jonp> 'cause you have an Action in there, with a return type of `void`
[01:46:29] <jonp> so you're implicitly "discarding" that await

[01:48:08] <jonp> > Best practice is to mark function async void only if it is fire and forget method, if you want to await on, you should mark it as async Task.
[01:48:10] <teegee> jonp: so I need a Func in my Register?
[01:48:32] <jonp> teegee: yeah; instead of Action<T>, you want Func<T, Task>
[01:48:56] <jonp> then line 102 you'd want `await state.Action()`
[01:49:25] <teegee> but not all actions are awaitable
[01:49:35] <teegee> i'll go read that stackoverflow
[01:50:11] <jonp> use e.g. Task.Run(() => Out(text))
[01:50:37] <jonp> and line 24 could become `(ms) => Task.Delay(ms)`

[01:52:31] <teegee> mh, yeah, I was hoping to avoid wrapping non awaitable calls in a Task.Run()
[01:53:27] <teegee> I've seen people querying the async statemachine attribute to figure out if something's awaitable but apparently, that's not recommended
[01:54:37] <teegee> I guess I could just make a Register() and a RegisterAsync() and handle it inside
[01:54:48] <lz_> btw why are these called "states" if they're tasks
[01:55:08] <teegee> because in the first version I called the thing a statemachine

[01:57:21] <lz_> especially those string keys lol
[01:57:48] <lz_> I was expecting the strings to be used for logging or something but you use them as identifiers
[01:57:56] <lz_> very very confusing
[01:59:54] <teegee> it makes for a nicer setup in the consuming application. first you define your pool of tasks and then you queue them up by name. Makes it easier when you enqueue a single state many times, because you don't have to define what it's doing every time
[02:00:40] <teegee> s/state/task/
[02:01:47] <lz_> RegisterTask() could return an object that you use later to queue. And if you really want to be able to get a task by name, have a GetTask(string name)

[12:33:48] <ap5> Ah :)
[12:34:19] <ap5> Then make sure that the functional tests run i development mode, and you will be OK
[12:34:53] <alguien> well that's the prob, maybe you want a different environment for tests
[12:36:48] <alguien> I'm actually looking to add a "Local" env because we use the Dev config on a remote machine. And now instead of looking through my code and finding where IsDevelopment() is called to add || IsEnvironment(EnvironmentConstants.Local), I have to rummage through runtime and framework internals to make sure I get all the differences.

[13:55:42] <jmer> dan01[m]: it's XML.
[13:55:50] <dan01[m]> ok
[13:56:04] <alguien> jmer, someone would have to explain that to the folks here. I'm thinking: Why not?
[13:56:24] <jmer> alguien: because how does it make sense to develop on two different environments?
[13:57:08] <jmer> can you break this "remote development environment" alguien ? or will someone bitch if it happens
[13:57:32] <jmer> dan01[m]: you can find information about the various tags used here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/web-config?view=aspnetcore-6.0
[13:58:09] <alguien> well, even your production app needs not run on a single identical env
[13:58:37] <alguien> I mean they'll notice if I break dev. It won't be a huge deal perhaps, I'd just have to fix it. Why?
[13:58:46] <alguien> *wouldn't
[13:58:54] <jmer> alguien:  because if you can get in trouble for breaking the "dev" environment it's not really a dev environment
[13:59:42] <jmer> I'm seeing this at my new work place as well, we have "Sandbox" and "Test".... But we can't break Sandbox or play with the data becaue other parts of the org is using the Sandbox environment to "test" their changes to product data... >.<
[14:00:36] <alguien> I reckon the primary purpose of the dev env is to enable FE to develop their thing, before both FE and BE get pushed together to test
[14:02:31] <MatthiasVance> Yes but that's the wrong definition of development :P
[14:02:36] <MatthiasVance> In this case!
[14:02:40] <MatthiasVance> Development is local to you
[14:03:02] <alguien> only if you're the only one developing
[14:03:16] <jmer> I am pushing for initiatives to make it easer for all devs to develop locally with local DBs... right now we are "sharing" the dbs from the Sandbox environment for testing, but only for SOME databases, others are local...
[14:03:22] <jmer> it doesn't make sense!!!! \o/
[14:03:36] <alguien> in any case, it makes sense to have a common pre-test env that spits out more informative errors

[14:07:33] <alguien> heh, alright
[14:07:41] <MatthiasVance> Ah we call that Staging
[14:07:45] <jmer> alguien: in that doc they specifically document what Development, Staing and Production is used for. Breaking this convention will give trouble later on
[14:08:16] <MatthiasVance> So we have Development which is local, Staging which is where everything goes CI/CD and Production

[14:12:26] <alguien> that implies that one should use dev locally, not that they should only use it locally
[14:13:04] <alguien> Wait, that link I posted is a "sample", sec
[14:13:12] <jmer> alguien: From what you described it sounds like you're making the Staging environment dependant on stuff that by convention should be used for "Development"
[14:13:46] <jmer> alguien: you're breaking conventions by not following the conventions of the framework (at least this is the impression I get from how you describe this)
[14:13:52] <alguien> we have remote dev, testing, and staging
[14:14:04] <alguien> and production is not local too of course :)
[14:14:43] <jmer> alguien: if you have both a local and remote development environment I feel strongly those should share settings. Else they need to be reanmed to distinguish between them.
[14:15:14] <alguien> jmer, I want to keep my test data to myself
[14:15:41] <jmer> alguien: Sure. That shouldn't be a problem.
[14:16:11] <alguien> you figure I should keep switching between databases in appsettings and then discarding changes before committing?
[14:16:16] <jmer> But don't have two that vary in behaviour but both rely on "IsDevelopment"
[14:16:31] <alguien> that's what we're having to do now
[14:16:38] <alguien> among other things
[14:17:13] <alguien> well I wish IsDevelopment could match more than one env (eg. by checking the prefix rather than == "Development" as it effectively does)
[14:20:00] <jmer> alguien: ok, let me reprhase. I think you should use the built in features to handle environments. If you need an extra environment, add it, but make sure it plays nice with the conventions and stuff that is delivered by default.
[14:21:53] <alguien> Do you have something specific in mind? Nothing occurs to me. I have different appsettings and launch settings if that helps *shrugs*
[14:23:47] <alguien> MatthiasVance, btw I'm not sure Staging is a good name for a dev envrionment, sorry XD
[14:24:12] <jmer> alguien: then you are aagainst a universally established convetion that the next environment after local dev is called staging
[14:24:26] <alguien> In my experience, Staging is an env most closely resembling production, where tested software gets tried out by the customer before going to production
[14:24:51] <jmer> alguien: that would be testing or in some cases "Pre-production"
[14:25:06] <jmer> User Acceptance Testing is certainly not done on staging :P
[14:25:25] <alguien> let me google
[14:26:15] <jmer> I mean.. It might be some places. But then you risk exposing the Users to features in the middle of development.
[14:26:28] <alguien> wat
[14:26:38] <alguien> look: https://umbraco.com/media/whajpu1r/deployment-left-to-right.png
[14:27:01] <jmer> alguien: just because Umbraco puts that there doesn't mean it's the universal truth.
[14:27:03] <alguien> It's like that only we have testing before staging, so users _aren't_ exposed to dev stuff, or test stuff
[14:27:23] <jmer> alguien: I think this confusion stems from naming
[14:27:50] <alguien> it's Local -> Dev -> Testing -> Staging -> Production. Me -> Devs -> Testers -> Clients -> Customers
[14:28:02] <alguien> Seems perfectly logical to me
[14:28:02] <jmer> Call it whatever you want, what fits in your organization. Just make sure it plays nice with established conventions and uses framework features for handling environments instead of homemade weird custom additions
[14:28:53] <jmer> alguien: I've been in places where it was Dev -> Staging -> Testing -> Preprod -> Production xD
[14:29:02] <jmer> you can do it in many ways and call it many things (it seems)...
[14:29:25] <alguien> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Staging
[14:29:30] <jmer> Just follow conventions of whatever tech you're using. This isn't a novel problem it's been fixed by many people in the past, hence the reason why .net has functionality to handle environments
[14:30:56] <alguien> Well, how do you reckon it should be done, since .NET considers dev to be one and only?
[14:31:09] <jmer> I wouldn't focus so much on the naming of the environments
[14:31:18] <alguien> great, Local it is XD
[14:31:35] <alguien> From where I'm sitting the .NET should allow multiple dev environment
[14:31:36] <alguien> *s
[14:31:51] <jmer> alguien: I got triggered because it sounded like you were applying a "Development" environment... Let's call it "template" to an environment that wasn't for development. I might have misunderstood something.
[14:31:52] <alguien> But since it doesn't, I have to work around it somehow
[14:32:10] <jmer> .net allows all the environments you need
[14:32:36] <jmer> including several dev environments, but I would expect trouble if you make that dependant ONLY on "IsDevelopment"
[14:33:18] <alguien> How does .NET allow several dev environments? It itself is internally dependent on IsDevelopment!
[14:33:28] <alguien> I feel like you're quite distracted today jmer :P
[14:33:34] <jmer> alguien: there will be some things that vary from Local and Remote development, so you need to distinguish between those two environments. They are both dev environments but I assume their DB connection strings would differ?
[14:33:49] <alguien> among other things, yes
[14:34:58] <jmer> alguien: IsDevelopment is for the standard functionality/convention. Just replace with "IsEnvironment"

[15:19:57] <pv2b> Hi! I'm trying to build a ASP.NET Core application, which requires two parts to it. one "worker" side, and an API side. I intend to use Kestrel on Windows to host the app as a Windows service. I've made some progress on the API part based on the "dotnet new webapi" app, but I'm confused what I'm supposed to do now. I've found a tutorial for how to host ASP.NET Core in a Windows Service, but
[15:19:57] <pv2b> I'm confused about how to "connect" my Web API to that? I can reference my API project from the Worker project, but then what? Am I even "supposed" to split it into multiple interdependent projects? I feel I'm missing some knowledge but I'm not sure what to search for.
[15:20:54] <MatthiasVance> jmer: I don't get that either :D

[15:25:19] <MatthiasVance> Well, I left because I didn't see any possibility of change anymore .. and they got booted in a really ugly way 6 months later
[15:25:46] <jmer> Ah. Right
[15:25:47] <MatthiasVance> Manager with big ego employing his friends and thinking his way is the best way with 0 technical experience lol
[15:26:05] <MatthiasVance> "Our outsourced people can do it in a day"
[15:26:20] <MatthiasVance> Yes, that's because you give them 0 time to do it right :P
[15:26:24] <jmer> outsourced people aren't bound in the same way
[15:26:36] <MatthiasVance> They were micromanaged, same as he tried to do with us
[15:26:41] <jmer> They can get away with short term solutions
[15:27:08] <MatthiasVance> I talked with them about how we want to do things together and they were really happy but as soon as manager found out it would be a tiny bit slower .. cut all ties
[15:27:21] <jmer> lol
[15:27:30] <jmer> but it's only slower if you look 3 months ahead
[15:27:40] <jmer> if you look 3 years ahead, it will be faster overall

[15:52:59] <Tobbi_> Like, to track the dependencies in between the tables?
[15:53:26] <Tobbi_> and stored procedures et.
[15:53:28] <Tobbi_> c
[15:53:28] <jmer> Tobbi_: If you're lucky they set up foreign key constraints.
[15:53:40] <Tobbi_> I don't only want tables.
[15:53:49] <Tobbi_> I also want to view which stored procedures call which
[15:53:51] <jmer> but a part form that, it will be tricky, there's nothing that prevents you from trying to join on nonsensical columns/data
[15:53:57] <jmer> hmm
[15:53:58] <Tobbi_> I'm currently using SQL Dependency Tracker.
[15:54:04] <jmer> not sure if there are stored proc code analysis tools

[15:56:49] <Tobbi_> Yeah, I mean there's a way in the management studio to track it for each object.

[17:10:02] <interop_madness> kek
[17:10:31] <interop_madness> adeel, best course of action is to ask specific questions for specific problems

[17:13:55] <adeel> interop_madness thank you for your responce
[17:15:46] <adeel> Actually I'm working erp project where I can implement setup like google meet please if you guide what are the best option for implementing in .net
[17:16:58] <adeel> I follow differnet project but did'nt find the best one where i can solve this
[17:18:12] <adeel> I also try https://developers.google.com/classroom/quickstart/dotnet#prerequisites but not complete
[17:18:30] <adeel> with google classroom api
[17:20:20] <interop_madness> adeel, it seems you first need to scope what you want to do. video chat conference system? there are web- and desktop-based ways to do it, and I think this is pretty nontrivial in either case
[17:20:33] <interop_madness> ERP integration? probably a completely different problem
[17:20:47] <adeel> yes video chat confernce system
[17:20:47] <interop_madness> google classroom? probably still something else entirely

[17:24:57] <interop_madness> once you have an understanding of this, some design decisions should follow, but my (uneducated) guess is that the real hard work will be making this application resilient over communication channels of varying quality

[18:01:54] <jmer> Our manager told us today that we will get the opportunity to buy office forniture for our WFH setups... but it's some weird setup where we pay 10-20€ pr. month for two years
[18:02:02] <jmer> and THEN we have to pay "the rest" and then we can keep the table..
[18:02:17] <jmer> but if we  change jobs, we have to pay the rest or deliver the table back
[18:02:20] <jmer> I think this is kind of odd...

[18:02:27] <MatthiasVance> So basically a loan

[18:02:37] <jmer> but we get to pay before taxes are paid

[18:03:02] <MatthiasVance> Or whatever your income tax is ;)
[18:03:25] <jmer> I'm not too knowledeable about the setup, but I find it odd that I pay for something the company gets to keep unless certain criteria are met

[18:05:36] <MatthiasVance> jmer: If you're interested in it, you might go for that setup but without the loan part

[19:14:26] <MatthiasVance> Probably not?
[19:18:35] <retux> I have a native library which I wrap with SWIG (which in turn uses P/Invoke). The name of the native library is libtinysplinecsharp.dll on Windows, libtinysplinecsharp.so on Linux, and libtinysplinecsharp.so on MacOS. The C# wrapper calls the native code like this: "DllImport("libtinysplinecsharp", ...". This works on Windows and Linux. But on MacOS I get: "dlopen(liblibtinysplinecsharp, 1): image not found". According to the docs,
[19:18:35] <retux> P/Invoke should load libtinysplinecsharp.so (or .dylib) and not liblibtinysplinecsharp.so. What's wrong here?

[19:41:20] <alguien> but I don't have that in my code, I don't understand what it's for
[19:41:39] <Nasp> Then don't call it?
[19:41:44] <Nasp> But i can't remember if it's enabled by default
[19:42:01] <alguien> we use the AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager, and call CheckPasswordSignInAsync to check the password
[19:42:37] <Nasp> That's user credentials

[19:44:54] <alguien> Nasp, Ah (to "enabled by default", not to "that's user credentials"). I guess my question now is why is there a Length > 0 condition here https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/bc5e386676ec5c806eef78d5fa754f1eadfe28c2/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting/src/HostingHostBuilderExtensions.cs#L218-L224
[19:46:42] <alguien> also, who asks whether a string is non-empty like that? XD
[19:48:58] <Nasp> Because pattern matching :D
[19:49:03] <Nasp> just use it for everything, even if it's not needed
[19:49:22] <Nasp> https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/bc5e386676ec5c806eef78d5fa754f1eadfe28c2/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting/src/HostingHostBuilderExtensions.cs#L229-L232 this also seems rather stupid

[19:51:33] <MatthiasVance> think that is a better word
[19:51:42] <Nasp> Yeah ok
[19:52:07] <Nasp> I was thinking of the same, but kinda hoping the downstairs apartment wil lbe sold first so i know that it wont be in vain

[21:05:20] <MatthiasVance> I don't know what happened to our repo but only 17% is F#
[21:05:38] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: 17% too much!
[21:05:55] <DoofusCan> I saw a great response for Tabs: developers with poor eyes who need huge fonts
[21:05:59] <MatthiasVance> 25% is JS???? where the fuck does this come from .. and CSS is 55%???
[21:06:12] <MatthiasVance> I have no clue :D
[21:06:16] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: LOL
[21:06:17] <MatthiasVance> I never write either JS or CSS
[21:06:34] <MatthiasVance> Someone checked in node_modules maybe? xD
[21:07:10] <DoofusCan> unless they happen to be using a font designed for large sizes without ridiculous spacing, using tabs means they can control their indents separately from the font size
[21:07:16] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: those #'s don't reflect the current state of your repo. they are goals that ms has set for you.
[21:07:27] <redoc> Anyone with experience on Flyout Panels? I cannot get my panel to disappear on selection
[21:07:56] <JakeSays> DoofusCan: i have poor eyes and still don't use tabs
[21:08:19] <DoofusCan> me neither, but I saw the logic in their argument
[21:08:37] <DoofusCan> I think the font sizes mentioned were well over 30
[21:08:49] <DoofusCan> so, serious eyesight issues
[21:09:04] <JakeSays> LOL yeah
[21:09:18] <DoofusCan> I also am aware of blind developers, so they could add a screen reader instead of increasing font sizes
[21:09:21] <JakeSays> but tab size is still a function of font size
[21:09:24] <MatthiasVance> Only C# developers worry about tabs vs spaces :D
[21:09:46] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: we also have big dicks
[21:10:01] <JakeSays> unlike those f# wankers
[21:10:04] <MatthiasVance> We definitely do, not sure how that relates to anything
[21:10:19] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: YOU are not a c# dev

[21:10:30] <MatthiasVance> You C###
[21:10:32] <DoofusCan> space vs tabs is a pain in Java, too but just for readability
[21:10:34] <MatthiasVance> xD
[21:10:36] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: LOL
[21:11:01] <JakeSays> DoofusCan: it's a pain in any language

[22:10:31] <GunArm> irwiss: responding to yesterday about .net 2.0.  that was because we have to support local governments who are still running windows 7.  and they are often incompetantly administered so they can't maintain their own runtime deployments.  and the installer size matters because we have to be able to push out updates to sites like that with often 10k+ instance deployments.  the guy before me killed a hospital network one time with his updat
[22:10:31] <GunArm> er code, mine regulates updates by a preset throughput amount, but this means updates with large installers can take days or weeks, which is an operational nightmare
[22:14:10] <GunArm> it's critical my stuff can "run everywhere", so we either have to target the lowest possible denominator, or self contained builds were a miracle meaning for the first time we could be building against a modern framework and it would work, but with NET6 preventing trimming of those self contained builds, my year of investment to make that possible has backfired since we're looking at multi-terrabyte updates on large sites
