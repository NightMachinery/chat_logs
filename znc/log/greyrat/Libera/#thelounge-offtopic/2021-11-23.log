[16:47:51] <xnaas> <Activ8> :( no avatars I like text lol
[16:47:51] <xnaas> Activ8: you don't love it? ;P https://blog.irccloud.com/avatars/
[16:48:40] <xnaas> <shadoozo> Thelounge isn't meant for powerusers
[16:48:40] <xnaas> I wish there was a web client that was... ðŸ˜…
[16:48:59] <xnaas> All the other web clients (tried within the last 1-2 months) are ass. :/
[16:54:34] <bookworm> not sure why every client needs this layout, we already have matrix clients that look just like that. I'd like to keep my cross platform IRC client :(
[16:55:00] <bookworm> and that includes plenty of messages on a single screen, two column layout by definition halfs that
[16:58:53] <xnaas> column, row, or both? ðŸ˜…
[16:59:25] <xnaas> but yes, I concur; nick and message should take a up just 1 line (if it's a really long message, obviously it wraps :P )
[17:08:48] <shadoozo> yeaaaah a poweruser web client would be nice
[17:24:27] <bookworm> s/row/column/, right
[17:24:33] <bookworm> you get what I mea 
[17:24:38] <bookworm> n*
[17:25:02] <bookworm> for me TL is powerful enough to use
[17:26:51] <xnaas> it works, but I want/need more :P
[17:42:50] <Activ8> xnaas maybe I do if the text formatting is right 
[17:47:24] <Activ8> xnaas lets have a nudge feature as well while devs are at it, like what msn messenger had

[23:53:14] <xnaas> Activ8: You used to be able to connect to Slack from an IRC client back when Slack was basically just "IRC plus"
[23:53:24] <xnaas> But I think they've long since killed that stuff
[23:53:34] <xnaas> as it grew to being way, way more than just a pretty IRC skin
[23:53:34] <Activ8> eeek
[23:53:46] <Activ8> I would love to replicate that skin for tlc
[23:56:32] <xnaas> https://mattermost.com/ would be the FOSS alternative to Slack. If you get bored and want to do some prying.
[23:57:32] <Activ8> oh nah I'm not that bored
[23:59:49] <xnaas> You can technically still connect an IRC client to whatever you want, like Slack, it's just...you know...super unofficial and not supported in any way. :P
[23:59:51] <xnaas> stuff like https://github.com/adsr/irslackd
