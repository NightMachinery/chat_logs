[16:28:03] <danieln> clason[m]: 0.6.1 - regarding your comment about "config" style setup, its the same when moving it out of packers scope into regular lua config...
[16:28:47] <clason[m]> sorry, then I don't know; it works for me, is all I can say

[16:31:18] <d1rewolf> I've somehow managed to mess things up with Packer. PackerUpdate seems to work, but I always get the error "async.lua:20: Error in coroutine: Vim:E944: Reverse range in character class". It still seems to update and install plugins

[16:31:35] <d1rewolf> here is my config: https://github.com/d1rewolf/nvim
[16:31:50] <d1rewolf> any ideas? thanks in advance... 
[16:32:54] <ii14[m]> no stack trace, only that single error message?
[16:33:40] <d1rewolf> ii14[m]: if you're asking that of me, yes, only that single error message

[16:37:15] <danieln> clason[m]: no need to be sorry, glad that it's not just me being dense here... workaround is `vim.api.nvim_exec([[ au VimEnter * edit ]], false)` lol
[16:37:20] <dchuri[m]> <d1rewolf> "I've somehow managed to mess..." <- I would try removing your `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer` directory, and `:PackerSync` in neovim
[16:39:11] <d1rewolf> dchuri[m]: removing that directory removes packer, right? 
[16:39:25] <p00f> yes
[16:40:46] <d1rewolf> so PackerSync won't work. dchuri[m] do you mean remove the directory and re-install packer? let me try that
[16:42:03] <dchuri[m]> Yes, removing that directory will remove all your plugins. Doing `:PackerSync` in neovim after doing that, will just install the plugins again
[16:42:04] <p00f> danieln: what happens if you `:debug e` in the first buffer? (without that autocommand)
[16:42:46] <d1rewolf> dchuri[m]: that removed the Packer commands as well, so I had to install from git. However, after doing so, things look better. thanks ;-)
[16:43:58] <danieln> p00f: I get dropped into a debug session apparently... lemme read up on how to hold this thing, never heard of it till now
[16:44:39] <p00f> yeah do you see error messages in that debug session?
[16:51:27] <danieln> p00f: nope, runs straight through, and stepping to the end takes a good long while

[16:55:38] <danieln> question is why that one does not trigger on a fresh vim instance, but apparently on BufOpen when I do `:bn` for any subsquent buffers (returning to the first does not help, it needs to be `:e`...)

[17:23:42] <danieln> clason[m]: I cant reproduce it with a minimal config it seems, but it is still happening if I remove every plugin from my regular config except treesitter...
[17:24:14] <clason[m]> hmm....
[17:24:31] <clason[m]> you are testing with `nvim --clean -u minimal.lua`?
[17:27:54] <danieln> I tested by redirecting XDG_XXX_HOME environment variables, I didn't know about `--clean`... but I seem to have found the culprit
[17:30:22] <danieln> clason[m]: I keep a classic .vimrc with some sane basic setting I also distribute to servers. I include this one https://github.com/debugloop/dotfiles/blob/master/dot_config/nvim/init.lua#L9 and later revise some settings, in this case notably https://github.com/debugloop/dotfiles/blob/master/dot_config/nvim/init.lua#L26 which reverts the `syn on` from plain .vimrc... if I never have syn on at any
[17:30:24] <danieln> points, the first buffer starts working as well as all other buffers
[17:31:04] <clason[m]> yeah, on Neovim you should never touch `syntax` unless you absolutely know what you are doing
[17:32:22] <clason[m]> bfredl worked hard to make things Just Work _on Neovim_ so old Vim lore about `syntax` no longer applies unconditionally
[17:32:59] *** Joins: aJJa (~aJJa@2a0a:e340:1001:300::8:6)
[17:33:00] <danieln> clason[m]: weirdest thing is, the order does not even matter... if I install/init treesitter before or after `syntax off` I still hit the same issue with the first buffer being handled incorrectly
[17:33:15] <clason[m]> and we are well past the point where it makes sense to try to keep a combined config -- this leads to more effort than just duplicating the (now few) relevant settings
[17:33:59] <clason[m]> no, that's not weird. loading tree-sitter and setting up syntax/highlight groups etc. are independent
[17:36:12] <danieln> I've been there, before I switched over to lua I had separate configs, but in light of being able to include a vimrc I re-merged... there are only two things I revert from my base vimrc, the colorscheme from plugin and `syntax on`
[17:36:13] <clason[m]> maybe this helps: I've seen before the opinion that `syntax` is an option that you just toggle -- that is not the case; it's a _command_, so each invocation has an effect, which does not cancel (all) consequences of prior invocations
[17:37:02] <danieln> clason[m]: yup, thats the basic issue here, me assuming `syn off` does a complete teardown :)
[17:37:17] <clason[m]> which you can't really "revert", is what I'm saying ;)
[17:38:56] <danieln> Gotcha :) Anyway, thanks for being my rubberducky and explaining where I went wrong :)

[19:49:36] <skebangaskebang4> hmmm - lemme try again
[19:49:37] <d1rewolf> every time autocomplete pops up i want to press enter to select, but it doesn't do that :)
[19:49:59] <p00f> you are doing `:set nocursorline` right?
[19:50:04] <skebangaskebang4> oops - you are correct
[19:50:09] <ii14[m]> d1rewolf: `:h ins-completion`
[19:50:23] <d1rewolf> ii14[m]: thanks!
[19:50:46] <skebangaskebang4> ok - confirm I see the same as you - `nocul` turns off *both* my "normal" background line highlight, and **in diffview**, the underline too
[19:51:01] <skebangaskebang4> @ii14:matrix.org do you know if it's possible to a) search within `:verb hi` results, or b) dump the results to a buffer so I can search therein?
[19:51:10] <skebangaskebang4> brb...
[19:51:30] <ii14[m]> d1rewolf: actually `ins-completion-menu`

[19:53:49] <p00f> should i be looking for something else?
[19:53:50] <ii14[m]> I think it's matching group names
[19:54:15] <skebangaskebang4> nope - no results either
[19:54:51] <p00f> ii14[m]: i see
[19:55:17] <ii14[m]> `:echo nvim_buf_set_lines(0,0,-1,v:false,split(nvim_exec('verb hi', v:true), "\n"))`
[19:55:35] <p00f> there is a `DiffviewCursorline` but it links to normal Cursorline
[19:55:38] <ii14[m]> `:call` instead of `:echo` actually, but it shouldn't matter
[19:55:48] <ii14[m]> create a new buffer though
[19:57:42] <p00f> i think that's a bug, can't see it documented anywhere
[19:58:41] <ii14[m]> what does `:setl diff?` say?
[19:59:04] <ii14[m]> I think in diff mode it's handled differently, but not sure what that's about
[20:00:48] *** Quits: samgranieri (~samgranie@user/samgranieri) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[20:01:01] <p00f> it is in diff mode indeed
[20:02:08] <zeraphel> question:  what does it take for sudo to work from (n)vim's command-line-mode ? revisiting that damn :w !sudo tee % command
[20:02:19] <p00f> there is no mention of cursorline in diff.txt
[20:02:28] <ii14[m]> it's hardcoded: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9800
[20:03:27] <ii14[m]> zeraphel: I think there are plugins that do this
[20:03:30] <p00f> ii14[m]: thanks
[20:07:36] <zeraphel> ii14[m]: thanks for the hint. I examining one such plugin right now.

[20:08:16] <zeraphel> It seems to be caching the password.  TBH i'd be more interested in configuring sudo to just work as i expect it to out of the box (or understand why its failing)
[20:09:14] *** Joins: qwd (~qwd@185.203.114.234)
[20:10:49] <zeraphel> I think this is because my user is configured to ask for a password before allowing privilege elevation, I'd like to 1. keep it this way 2. avoid using plugins for this.
[20:12:27] *** Quits: jacky (~jacky@47.199.68.120) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[20:14:43] <p00f> it fails because bang commands don't have a tty in neovim
[20:15:08] <ii14[m]> you can make it so it will never require a password from you, but I don't know if this is a good idea
[20:15:49] <ii14[m]> but yeah, it's failing because `:!` is not interactive probably
[20:17:52] <Bowuigi[m]> Try `:term` insteaf
[20:17:53] <p00f> And it's not interactive because neovim guis don't run in a terminal
[20:17:54] <Bowuigi[m]> * Try `:term` instead
[20:18:24] <ii14[m]> yes, that's how it is by default
[20:18:32] <Bowuigi[m]> I think you can use `:term command` but I don't remember
[20:18:40] *** Joins: FluffyMask (~masque@user/fluffymask)
[20:18:49] <zeraphel> I figured as much,  Only question is how i could establish a pipe to write into (to then tee from the :terminal using sudo)
[20:19:11] <Bowuigi[m]> Oh
[20:19:38] <ii14[m]> libuv maybe
[20:19:57] <Bowuigi[m]> Are you trying to remake the w!! hack on nvim?
[20:20:25] <zeraphel> Bowuigi[m]: not remake exactly,  both vim and nvim fail in the exact same manner lmao.  But yes.
[20:20:38] <Bowuigi[m]> Lol
[20:20:50] <zeraphel> doesn't the old 8.2 vim api support pipes / sockets in one way or another?
[20:20:57] <Bowuigi[m]> `:w /tmp/editedfile` maybe?
[20:21:37] <Bowuigi[m]> Or you can use the --stdin option on sudo and prompt for the password on standard input
[20:22:04] <zeraphel> if i take the password from stdin, where does tee take the pipe w/ the buffer contents from?
[20:23:38] <Bowuigi[m]> It is not exactly related, I was purposing an alternative to :term
[20:24:56] <zeraphel> hmm maybe :)

[23:46:37] <phryk> Hey, I introduced a bug while writing a new function. I've now undone changes until the bug was removed and established what it was – but that meant I needed to add changes *after* undoing the entire function definition – can i get that function back somehow?

[23:47:03] <phryk> function/bug stuff completely independent from nvim btw, I'm just using it to write code.
[23:49:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> wat?
[23:50:19] <phryk> I found an article, apparently I want to navigate undo branches.
[23:51:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> <C-r> to navigate forward again
[23:51:30] <sunjonSenghanBri> there's a couple of plugins that visualise the undo tree
[23:52:22] <phryk> sunjonSenghanBri: yeah, no to <C-r> – the state I want isn't accessible through undo/redo. Apparently I need to figure out what exactly g+/g- do^^
[23:53:10] <phryk> mhh, do those even work in nvim? i get an extra window showing… something?
[23:54:33] <phryk> oh, it's not :g-, but just typing g- in normal mode
