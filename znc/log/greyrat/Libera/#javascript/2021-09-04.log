[00:20:53] <Slade> UI design. typing an phone number that may or may not be international. you typically have a dropdown for the country code right?  having people add the country code to the field is nonstandard?

[02:07:39] <earendel> sometimes it feels cleaner. but i don't think it has any effect.
[02:09:02] <GreenJello> I use null when I want an explicit lack of a value
[02:09:11] <GreenJello> it's preserved in JSON and stuff
[02:09:22] <earendel> could be when the properties for a single object change (not the values but the names) it could somehow be treated as something new at compiler level.

[03:57:26] <cAMP> ThePendulum: I see a .map with custom function to compare the thing a and b
[03:59:18] <cAMP> ThePendulum: but in javascript that is .sort(yourFancySortNComparisonFunc)
[04:01:44] <cAMP> ah, so js is now also in the .map club: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#sorting_with_map
[04:02:33] <Maxdamantus> That's not a good solution.
[04:03:19] <Maxdamantus> The best way is the one alluded to by GreenJello, just construct a comparison function that does each comparison, from most significant to least significant, until one of the comparisons produces a non-zero result.
[04:04:35] <Maxdamantus> You could also do it using multiple `sort`s, if you're willing to assume sort stability (previous ES versions and older browsers don't guarantee sort stability). If you do it that way, you'll do the comparisons the other way round.
[04:05:12] <Maxdamantus> a.sort((a, b) => cmp0(a, b) || cmp1(a, b) || cmp2(a, b));
[04:05:22] <Maxdamantus> a.sort(cmp2); a.sort(cmp1); a.sort(cmp0);

[04:06:00] <Maxdamantus> (either works, but the latter is probably less efficient, and makes an unnecessary assumption of stable sorting)
[04:06:45] <cAMP> I wonder if you really got the point of why&when one might use .map
[04:07:50] <cthulchu_> my folks! I heard of people stealing auth sessions with custom JS. Basically accessing, say, facebook's cookies and taking the token. I mean, it's easy with an xss, but can we do it from a different host? Browser does protect cookies and it's not to be overriden with JS?
[04:08:39] <cthulchu_> It's just... I'm seeing a cookie consent message that asks users for "first party data from other sources"
[04:08:43] <cAMP> cthulchu_: cannot do that anymore
[04:08:50] <cthulchu_> oh thanks god

[04:09:10] <GreenJello> cthulchu_, xss is the main way that happens. Other exploits are site-specific
[04:10:49] <cAMP> cthulchu_: there are ways to steal cookies, but in general browsers have implemented rules against that for a decade
[04:11:16] <GreenJello> http-only cookies specifically prevent XSS from stealing the cookie
[04:11:33] <cthulchu_> right, that makes sense
[04:11:45] <cthulchu_> but then you can't access it even from local JS?
[04:11:48] <GreenJello> but it might still be possible to e.g. change the user's password, or do bad stuff within the browser session
[04:12:01] <GreenJello> correct, cookies are for the server
[04:12:11] <cthulchu_> yes, I'm familiar with that concept
[04:12:23] <cthulchu_> It;s just.... it's so comfy to set the expiration and rely on it
[04:12:32] <cthulchu_> what about local storage? is it TLD-specific too?
[04:12:51] <cthulchu_> and local storage? and web sql?
[04:12:59] <cthulchu_> *session storage
[04:14:00] <GreenJello> those are accessible by client side JS, so they're not safe from XSS
[04:14:01] <cthulchu_> yeah, I'm pretty sure it's all protected. So, now from dev perspective, the only way to pass data from one domain to another (when the user navigates) is only through the url params?
[04:14:18] <GreenJello> you can submit forms at other sites
[04:14:20] <cthulchu_> I know about xss. I wonder about cross-TLD
[04:14:56] <cthulchu_> xss only works within the TLD. once we're trying to pass info inbetween TLDs, it becomes very hard to do.
[04:15:19] <GreenJello> the SameSite property of cookies, and CSRF tokens can prevent CSRF attacks
[04:15:24] <cthulchu_> I actually had a case when I needed to make a piece of info available for another domain on user navigation and I couldn't.
[04:15:32] <GreenJello> I don't think TLD means what you think it means
[04:15:36] <GreenJello> .com is a TLD
[04:15:47] <cthulchu_> it's a zone, but ye
[04:16:03] <cthulchu_> I mean passing data inbetween domains

[04:16:31] <GreenJello> most things work by origin, though cookies can be relaxed to share across subdomains
[04:17:03] <cthulchu_> ye, subdomains is not an issue usually
[04:17:05] <GreenJello> the origin is the domain + port
[04:17:22] <cthulchu_> what I wonder is how to pass info from a.com to b.com
[04:17:34] <cthulchu_> besides the url params.
[04:17:44] <cAMP> you can make http requests with js
[04:17:53] <cthulchu_> front-end only

[04:19:12] <cthulchu_> I don't see how it applies.
[04:19:26] <cthulchu_> CORS is about resource loading right?
[04:19:35] <cAMP> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/cors_principle.png
[04:20:05] <cAMP> so you can also make xml reqs
[04:20:26] <cthulchu_> ok, here's a situation. A user lands on my site A. I generate an ID for them. Now, when a user goes to my other site B from site A, I want to be able to pass user ID. Front-end only. And no query params.
[04:20:36] <cAMP> most browsers probably forbid abusing CORS now
[04:21:15] <cthulchu_> I don't think it's possible...
[04:21:25] <systemfault> If you control both domains, you can use postMessage
[04:21:34] <cthulchu_> how can I?
[04:21:47] <cthulchu_> the user navigated
[04:21:53] <cthulchu_> unload happens before the new load

[04:22:26] <systemfault> Anyway, read about it :) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage

[07:46:04] <atcold> I have an HTML file were I <script src="…"> a library which is adding everything to some alias. VSC IntelliSense does not know this, so autocompletion and docs don't work. I believe I need to fill out a jsconfig.json or add a ///<reference path="…"> but not exactly sure what to put in there.

[07:54:09] <atcold> If in my index.html I have <script src="./node_modules/ml-matrix/matrix.umd.js"></script>, then I can do things like console.log(mlMatrix.Matrix.eye(3)) in script.js.
[07:54:39] <shan> okay
[07:54:39] *** Joins: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman)
[07:54:41] <shan> but no intellisense
[07:54:46] <atcold> Correct.
[07:55:08] <atcold> I'm using P5JS, which expects you *not* to use modules.
[07:55:19] <shan> right
[07:55:36] <shan> p5.js has to actually export some members for it to work
[07:56:04] <atcold> It seems like it exports stuff in the main namespace.

[12:38:32] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[12:38:47] <Voxel> Does anyone know how the following line works?
[12:38:49] <Voxel> https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/main/src/client/actions/ChannelUpdate.js#L13
[12:39:09] <Voxel> is it correct that it inherits the "_update()" from Base class?
[12:39:09] <Voxel> https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/main/src/structures/Base.js#L28
[12:39:25] <Voxel> If so, I can't find the further...
[12:39:40] <Voxel> Like, where the actual request happens...
[12:39:51] <Voxel> Is it the following: <https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/main/src/client/websocket/handlers/CHANNEL_UPDATE.js#L14>
[12:40:36] *** Quits: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[12:41:41] <Voxel> This one looks like nonsense: https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/main/src/structures/Base.js#L30
[12:43:08] <Voxel> Or does it call "_patch()" from Channel because of "this" and it inherits from Base?
[12:45:31] *** Joins: lalitmee__ (~lalitmee@180.94.33.37)
[12:47:43] <Voxel> Okay. I'll start from the begging. The main issue is to find where actual request to Discord API is happening.
[12:48:02] *** Quits: lalitmee_ (~lalitmee@180.94.33.33) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:48:10] <Voxel> This is the trace I'm currently on:

[12:48:36] <Voxel> https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/main/src/client/actions/ChannelUpdate.js#L13
[12:48:51] <Voxel> And that's it
[12:49:10] <Voxel> It seems, "channel._update(data);" is quite opaque...
