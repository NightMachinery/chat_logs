[00:39:39] <qubenix> bitcoincurious54: i didn't watch the whole video, just a few minutes. tor exit nodes are always a bad idea, that's not news. use onlynet=onion to only connect to peers with onion addresses to avoid exit nodes.
[00:40:11] <qubenix> i have always used bitcoin on whonix, so all of my traffic is forced over tor. never had any issue.
[00:41:34] <bitcoincurious54> what can go wrong if you don't use onlynet=onion ?
[00:43:00] <qubenix> you will connect outside of the tor network, using tor exit nodes. exit nodes can screw with your traffic.

[02:04:45] <s17> teach your nephew about different base systems, that should be fun
[02:04:57] <Ara> The conversion from base 6 to hexadecimal is something you can do by hand, and the elliptic curve math of calculating a public key from a private key might be as well, but actually hashing the public key with RIPEMD160(SHA256(SHA256(pubkey))) is not something you want to do by hand
[02:05:07] <Ara> Thats several days of tedious math
[02:05:11] <Henry151> i want basically "spoken english" explanation of "what does bitadress.org do mathematically, when we give it a base6 private key, to generate the public address?"
[02:05:27] <Henry151> Ara: that's the kind of answer i was seeking
[02:05:52] <s17> I saw a hand-drawn video of some kind of bitcoin calculation and it took almost a whole sheet of graphing paper and lots of numbers
[02:06:07] <earnestly> Henry151: The book mentions this
[02:06:16] <Henry151> so, we convert base 6 to hexadecimal, and then i would love more clarity on "the elliptic curve math of calculating a public key from a private key"
[02:06:18] <s17> I mean, done by hand. the video was just a video of live action writing
[02:06:25] <earnestly> Might be worth looking over it for your own sake
[02:06:39] <earnestly> Henry151: Literally has diagrams of the curve

[19:34:01] <palladidrago> Evolver: what exactly do you need?
[19:34:55] <Evolver> palladidrago: I need a link to a wiki page stating how to set up a wallet beneficiary (given some conditions like time elapsed without any spends).
[19:35:34] <Evolver> or even multiple beneficiaries, say x% for each
[19:36:03] <Evolver> with or without taproot or using just the older timestamp features of bitcoin
[19:36:12] <earnestly> These would be useful case studies even if only as thought experiments
[19:36:35] <earnestly> E.g. you wish to leave n amount of money to m family members, but all the family members are hostile
[19:37:07] <earnestly> So there is no way to use human trust to ensure distribution according to your wishes
[19:37:37] <earnestly> As such the contract has to do it automatically, autonomously
[19:37:42] <Evolver> ya
[19:37:53] <palladidrago> You could just send them the transaction and make the bitcoin spendable only after you die
[19:38:08] <earnestly> While also having a way to change the distribution, cancel it, etc. until death
[19:38:12] <Evolver> yes, let's have it written how to do this in multiple ways
[19:38:34] <Evolver> and to change it
[19:38:41] <earnestly> palladidrago: This experiment assumes you want to still use your money until that occasion
[19:38:45] <palladidrago> I'm more familiar with solidity and ethereum, can you have a script that sends a tx after X timestamp?
[19:38:50] <earnestly> Spending it means it's no longer usable?
[19:39:01] *** Joins: kico (~kico@user/kico)
[19:39:03] <palladidrago> yep
[19:39:05] *** Joins: VBOK (~VB@ip68-12-166-105.ok.ok.cox.net)
[19:39:10] <earnestly> Also it has to work almost like a deadman's switch
[19:39:23] <palladidrago> honestly dead man switches would work better on ethereum
[19:39:24] <Evolver> completely
[19:39:28] <earnestly> Rather than merely "after x time", at least the trigger has to be autonomously initiated
[19:39:35] <Evolver> palladidrago: why is that (on eth)?
[19:39:47] <palladidrago> you need 1. an oracle to know when you die
[19:39:57] <Evolver> just the lack of spending for x time is fine
[19:40:02] <palladidrago> and 2. a way to automatically "push" a tx at that time
[19:40:14] <Evolver> oracle is more untrustable than the absence of spending
[19:40:25] <palladidrago> I think that on bitcoin to make a script you need to send it as a tx
[19:40:51] <palladidrago> as in the script can't own the bitcoin, the script is attached to the bitcoin and it defines when the bitcoin should be spendable

[19:43:40] <palladidrago> genius
[19:43:57] <palladidrago> ok so that's problem 1 solved
[19:44:22] <Evolver> Another problem is what if a beneficiary dies with the original owner
[19:44:33] <Evolver> so then it'll go from one dead wallet to another
[19:44:48] <palladidrago> that's why you shouldn't send it to a wallet
[19:44:48] <earnestly> I don't think you can/should do anything about that tbh
[19:44:54] <palladidrago> I thought of something
[19:44:57] <palladidrago> Question thot
[19:44:58] <palladidrago> tho
[19:44:59] <earnestly> That's something the beneficiary should care about
[19:45:02] <Evolver> so the beneficiary also needs a similar system

[19:49:53] <palladidrago> it's on bsv lol
[19:50:01] <palladidrago> yea ig the script would be too big for btc
[19:51:14] <Evolver> If it's suggested to use taproot for configurable flexibility, e.g. how long to wait before transferring (e.g. 1 year), which addresses to send it to, and what percentage to send to each.
[19:51:22] <Evolver> then that might be the way to go
[19:51:49] <Evolver> with the trigger just being a lack of spending
[19:52:18] <Evolver> And this should keep reapplying to the address if it receives any new incoming balance.
[19:53:36] <earnestly> The bigger issue seems to be adjusting the ratios, number of beneficiaries, etc.

[19:55:32] <Evolver> yes
[19:55:56] <earnestly> If that is possible then it seems the simplest approach

[19:56:31] <earnestly> It'd be the same as people donating to satoshi's address
[19:57:02] <earnestly> Evolver: I imagine the spend will only happen once, so if coins end up in your wallet again, they'll stay there until someone guesses the private key
[19:57:49] <earnestly> i.e. lost, but not your problem :p
[19:58:13] <palladidrago> lost bitcoin is bitcoin that will be hodl'd forever

[23:00:07] <shiza> There's this site hodl.camp where you can see sats per currency. If you switch to won, seems to tell a won buys 2.4 satoshi. That seems a convenient thing for them, I guess. But what if bitcoin increases in price? Wouldn't koreans benefit from being able to transact in msat?
[23:00:37] <Ademan> we've got 30x between us and sat/cent parity I'm not gonna worry about half sats lol
