[12:53:22] <relejek[m]> Aaron: znc is the medium , you'll still be joining on the libera.chat network.
[12:53:58] <relejek[m]> read this if you have your znc creds https://www.gnulinuxindia.org/blog/irc-bouncer/
[12:58:00] <relejek[m]> Abhi:  can't say like 99% of Indian kids don't get anything from santa for Christmas. that implies either we've all been naughty or we've all been neglected by santa. no wonder, it is scientific impossibility to visit homes of billions of kids in one night.

[15:59:53] <NeoVoid[m]> enjoy the group
[16:00:38] <NeoVoid[m]> or irc or matrix or anything
[16:00:39] <bugswriter> I know it doesn't really matter. It's just the faulty logic I was pointing.
[16:03:18] <voidsoul-> Heres the cool channel i found over irc ##japanese 
[16:03:52] <bugswriter> can you tell, what's the difference with two ## or one # sometimes I see two sometimes I see one
[16:04:08] <voidsoul-> i don't know either.
[16:04:18] <voidsoul-> this channel seems to have two 
[16:04:58] <voidsoul-> may be its subchannel of bigger network or something? 
[16:08:11] <voidsoul-> i found it https://www.reddit.com/r/irc/comments/4784dj/dumb_question_whats_the_point_of_double_ing_a/
[16:08:31] <voidsoul-> its for indicating the channel is unofficial 
[16:10:48] <voidsoul-> so there should be original #Japanese channel 
[16:33:38] <bugswriter> make sense

[23:16:42] <iamak[m]> In dwm, do they just increase border width to be equal to border padding instead of actually padding the windows?
