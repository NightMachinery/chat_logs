[14:21:13] <Faux> Do they have a distcc/iscream?
[14:21:33] <ERROH> they don't even do parallel builds
[14:21:56] <ERROH> so i estimate it has about 500mb of codes to compile on single cpu
[14:51:33] <Carbonflux> humans are amazing
[14:52:01] <Carbonflux> i doubt the universe itself contains 500mb of code.
[14:52:53] <Carbonflux> thats like 500 million characters.
[14:53:06] <Carbonflux> who write all that?
[14:53:48] <Carbonflux> its all about that Adderall.
[15:01:43] <Carbonflux> actually now that i think about it, the universe does direct computing, data, method and execution are all part of the same monad, so what, maybe five instructions?
[15:01:57] <Carbonflux> and it does not need to be compiled.
[15:02:08] <Carbonflux> we have a lot to learn imo
[15:04:31] <Carbonflux> maybe there is a mathematical rule here, the more parallel a system is the fewer instructions it needs.
[15:05:42] <Carbonflux> so if the universe had only a single cpu it would need trillions of lines of code.
[15:06:09] <Carbonflux> but if every atom is a cpu, it would only need a few.
[15:07:18] <Carbonflux> its like a monitor where every pixel is a gpu, you could do real time raytracing at the refresh rate of the monitor is a decent number of bounces.
[15:08:33] <Carbonflux> but then people would by up all the monitors for crypto mining.
[15:08:57] * jotham shits in Carbonflux's cunt
[15:09:22] <jotham> if you know a single person in crypto
[15:09:25] <jotham> they are either hostile
[15:09:34] <jotham> or taking advantage

[15:10:08] <jotham> these is no model where they are - quite good people, just taking advantage of the wind
[15:10:18] <jotham> since the wind is literally only your fart
[15:10:21] <Carbonflux> people in crypto are all cyphers tho.
[15:10:24] * Carbonflux hides
[15:10:46] <jotham> that's a very funny old man thing to say
[15:10:51] <jotham> i say that as an old man
[15:10:56] <jotham> it's not true in practice
[15:11:05] <jotham> it;s worse than the inverse of veganism
[15:11:20] <Carbonflux> ya, i don't think its an ethical occupation either.

[18:46:43] <ashafq> dukwon: This is why every commit should be GPG signed
[18:58:50] <T`aZ> or ms start fixing their crap
[18:59:41] <T`aZ> its purely a github issue that ms doesn't seem to want to fix
[19:02:55] <Faux> ashafq: github's commit signing doesn't support gpg keys expiring; if your keys expire then all of your historical commits are unsigned. \o/
[19:03:11] <Faux> (Expiry is hard problem in key management.)
[19:08:15] <ashafq> Faux: True. But are commits from 20 years ago still relevant?
[19:09:05] <ashafq> Actually, I take that back given the recent CVE with argc and argv
[19:10:33] <Faux> How do you prove a commit is from 20 years ago if it's not signed?
[19:11:18] <ashafq> It is a difficult problem. But signed commit is better than unsigned commit even if the key is expired.
[19:12:57] <Faux> Not according to github, which doesn't mark unsigned commits, and marks signed commits with expired keys as INVALID.
[19:13:57] <ashafq> Well, Github UI are just suggestions ðŸ˜‰ real developers use the CLI
[19:17:22] <Faux> Which doesn't show signing status at all. \o/
