[00:09:19] <aeyxa> I'm running into the same issue as here https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/2856, does anyone have a suggestion?
[00:09:39] <aeyxa> `A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated.`
[00:09:59] <aeyxa> I'm trying to run docker login on a windows machine via ansible
[00:10:45] <aeyxa> The login command works in a powershell prompt, seems to be something specific about a remote session.

[00:19:40] <aeyxa> wow, I fixed it, that was really weird
[00:21:05] <aeyxa> I'm not quite sure how the .docker directory gets created on windows, but for some reason, the user I was using for the ansible deployment didn't have a .docker directory. I logged in and manually copied the .docker/config.json over to that users profile and it works. So, I guess I'll just need to do something similar but in ansible.
[00:21:31] <aeyxa> Gonna destroy and rebuild to see if I can figure out why it was under a different user but not that one though.

[00:34:46] <ada_> like, my guess is that you might be using some kind of docker module, or are you siimply running commands through the shell module?

[11:41:56] *** Zelec1 is now known as Zelec
[11:42:26] <DeeJayh_> zoredache: I did `apk add --no-cache bash` and yes, I ran into the exact issue you specified
[11:42:41] <DeeJayh_> I'm having trouble figuring out why
[11:42:48] <ikke> You can try to install gcompat, but not sure if steam runs with that
[11:43:45] <DeeJayh_> ah nice
[11:43:53] <DeeJayh_> this is that whole c/MUSL issue hmm?
[11:43:59] <zoredache> doesn't seem to run on debian:bullseye image either.
[11:44:33] <DeeJayh_> unfotunate. I didn't want to have to use a bulkier ubuntu image for it, but maybe they host the minimal image and I can build it from scratch
[11:44:47] <DeeJayh_> weird that it wouldn't work on debian but would on ubuntu
[11:44:51] <DeeJayh_> thanks steam *shrug*
[11:45:36] <DeeJayh_> same problem even with gcompat
[11:45:50] <DeeJayh_> it's all good I didn't realize what I was getting into with alpine apparently.
[11:45:56] <zoredache> well, it probably needs something that is in the debian image, but not the bullseye-slim image I was using
[11:45:57] <DeeJayh_> Just looked for the smallest image size
[11:46:49] <DeeJayh_> I've learned more about docker in the last week of cracking away than ever before, I failed to even consider that a different distro may just be incompatible, silly as that it
[11:47:35] <ikke> Propriatary is the worst, because they just cater to some bigger distros and ignore the rest

[11:53:59] <zoredache> oh, I think I may see the problem
[11:54:33] <zoredache> that seems to be a 32bit binary in there, but the images you used, and I have tried are x64
[11:54:37] <DeeJayh_> ikke: yea, I wish game related software, and their distribution platforms, were more FOSS.
[11:54:46] <DeeJayh_> zoredache: that's absolutely correct
[11:55:00] <DeeJayh_> this guy seems to be making dockers for steamcmd game servers
[11:55:09] <DeeJayh_> and has one that is pretty ready:
[11:55:11] <DeeJayh_> https://hub.docker.com/r/ich777/debian-baseimage
[11:56:39] <DeeJayh_> still about 105MB
[11:56:45] <DeeJayh_> but it should do the trick.
[11:57:36] <Czernobog> hello, I want to install flood UI for qbittorrent on docker but don't know how and the wiki on github doesn't seem to be helpful can someone help me? Here's my qbittorrent docker-compose https://pastebin.com/vey8uwMw and here's the flood UI https://flood.js.org/
[12:02:32] <DeeJayh_> zoredache:  still getting `E: Package 'lib32gcc1' has no installation candidate` on the debian buster slimimage *sigh* says `lib32gcc-s1` replaces it though? Wish steam would just move on from 32 bit libraries. I'm not sure I can even run them at all since the host is archlinux and they dropped 32 bit support.
[12:02:38] <DeeJayh_> Not sure how all that works yet

Some TLS libraries, including older versions of openssl (1.0.2 and older; HexChat on windows uses 1.0.2), see the chain up to the expired DST root and reject the certificate, even though there's a 2nd valid chain terminating at ISRG Root X1.
