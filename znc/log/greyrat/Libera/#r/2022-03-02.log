[01:53:27] <confuzeus> are these rankings truly objective? i always wondered why russian institutions are not highly ranked when there are so many decent programmers in the wild that are from that country. or they do not do or translate their russian research?
[01:55:43] <Colombo> confuzeus: because university ranking is mostly bullshit
[01:56:40] <Colombo> they are measures designed in the Anglo-Saxon world (UK+US) and for Anglo-Saxon world, taking in account stuff like if cafeteria is good, if students are happy or if the branding is well-known.
[01:57:06] <Colombo> These rankings completely fail in Eastern Europe, because no one is happy.
[01:58:54] *** Joins: rickyrick (~rickyrick@d23-16-13-108.bchsia.telus.net)
[01:58:58] <Colombo> Also because Anglo-Saxon universities are run like a business, where a lot of income is from international students trying to study there, so branding is an important strategy (and thus these rankings serve a point from this POV). But this is not true almost anywhere else in Europe, where universities are primarily centers of education serving the particular country and their population, in places where education is free and where anyone coul
[01:58:58] <Colombo> d study for free, as long as they understand native language.
[02:00:30] <Colombo> confuzeus: there is a lot of written about why university rankings often don't make any sense. https://elephantinthelab.org/the-accuracy-of-university-rankings-in-a-international-perspective/
[02:01:02] <confuzeus> cool. will read it up
[02:02:04] <Colombo> also, many US universities are HUGE
[02:02:18] <Colombo> and often, the larger the university, the better it faces in many rankings.
[02:02:52] <Colombo> https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/154683/why-do-german-universities-rank-so-low-internationally
[02:05:57] <shrysr> I agree with Colombo - i use the ranking only as a .. loose indicator, should have said FWIW
[02:10:58] <shrysr> And fwiw, saying ... 'I graduated from a top 10 uni' /prolly/ does not get you all that much in the industrial job market and I think matters even less, if at all, after getting into said job.

[10:28:26] <nvuafo> is there a way to generate random two coordinate points which are fixed length apart?
[10:29:07] <nvuafo> i was thinking about using runif and applying the distance formula until the desired length is found... but that takes too long.
[10:31:03] <flip214> nvuafo: choose a random point, and then a random angle - the distance is fixed, you say
[10:31:38] <nvuafo> yea the distance is fixed.
[10:34:40] <flip214> for 2d a random angle should be good enough... in 3d (or higher) it's more complex
[11:00:05] <rickyrick> wat
[11:00:35] <rickyrick> Why not just sample the first point, then sample the second point on the sphere centred at the first point
[11:01:11] <rickyrick> If you just want to sample uniformly on the sphere there's a trick involving normalizing the sample on a spherical multivariate normal
