I would like to preserve indentation no matter how many times RET key is pressed.  Anyone know how to do it?

[10:46:31] <bpalmer> Well, I recommend adjusting because fighting coding conventions is tedious and makes it hard to exchange code with others. But , at hte very least, define your own mode rather than use fundamental-mode
[10:47:16] <bpalmer> fundamental-mode is in some sense an absence of a major mode; it doesn't have hooks like fundamental-mode-hook (nor does it run after-change-major-mode-hooks), it doesn't have its own keymap, etc
[10:47:42] <bpalmer> it's trivial to define a trivial mode of your own that has no functionality to use instead of fundamental mode, but which behaves like a real major mode.
[10:47:44] <ville> bpalmer: well I am never going to exchange any significant amount of lisp code with anyone. i just don't write it beyond configuring emacs.

[13:29:07] <parsnip> :)
[13:29:19] <susam> With ido-mode enabled, C-x C-f seems to figure out what I mean if I just the path I need. I don't have to kill the pre-populated path. For example, if it prepopulates ~/foo/bar/baz/qux/ but I want to visit ~/foo/quux, all I do is type quux after ~/foo/bar/baz/qux/ and it automatically looks up the parents and finds ~/foo/quux and autocompletes that.

[22:13:29] <johnjay> is there a way in emacs to print the code of a function?
[22:13:47] <johnjay> or do you have to read in the .el file, find it that way?
