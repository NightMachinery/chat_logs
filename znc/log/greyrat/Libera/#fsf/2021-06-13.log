[01:46:50] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
[01:47:38] <aggi> since source-based work is crucial to the idea of freedom this is highly relevant how a distro supports this, and I question the recommendations of the FSF

[01:48:46] <adfeno> aggi: I don't like source-based ones that much, they don't account for people who cant afford to build everything from source
[01:48:54] <jxself> "The freedom to redistribute copies must include binary or executable forms of the program, as well as source code, for both modified and unmodified versions. (Distributing programs in runnable form is necessary for conveniently installable free operating systems.)"
[01:49:10] <adfeno> Also, source-based ones make more energy consumption.
[01:49:28] <aggi> adfeno: this isn't entirely true, since the hindrance is mostly bloatware, and source-based distros too can ship binary
[01:49:30] <adfeno> Be careful with global heathing/warming/whatever.
[01:50:03] <adfeno> aggi: OK, so you will like Guix then.
[01:50:11] <jxself> But yes, the packages can be re-built from source. Invoke the appropriate commands in the package manager.
[01:50:21] <adfeno> Since it has option to build from source, but always gets the package definitions.

[01:58:51] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html

[02:00:26] <jxself> I think the point remains.
[02:00:26] <adfeno> aggi: you misunderstood
[02:00:43] <adfeno> It's about packages and project and community's practices
[02:01:17] <aggi> and guix and trisquel are supposed to address this by scattering development efforts?
[02:01:40] <adfeno> The FSDG is all about the available packages, documentation, and also project's and community's practices.
[02:02:17] <adfeno> aggi: That is one way to look at it, and I do agree that this is problematic.
[02:02:31] <adfeno> This is why I myself put myself on the fire to question this:

[02:25:38] <Noisytoot> aggi, Is there a small kernel and compiler?
[02:25:47] <hays> uh, the linux kernel may be large but it is well designed and documented, and certainly has no purposeful obfuscation of the source code
[02:25:51] <jxself> aggi: Not "just" them.
[02:26:18] <Alicia> I don't think the freedom to study it requires you to have the time to study all of it
[02:26:18] <Noisytoot> hays, It has some blobs, but linux-libre removes them
[02:26:29] <jxself> I studied the kernel named Linux for example in order to draw out conclusions on licensing. Also, the GNU Linux-libre project had to do that in order to prepare their FSDG-compatible version.
[02:26:36] <aggi> Noisytoot, some niche projects existed, such as tiny c compiler which JIT compiled linux kernel during boot, more than a decade ago, and the people around www.j-core.org seem sane, didn't proceed their efforts to my knowledge
[02:27:08] <Alicia> Noisytoot: there is Fabrice Bellard's tcc (Tiny C Compiler) :)
[02:27:40] <aggi> some efforts where made with portable c compiler, with which openbsd succeeded a while ago to compiler kernel and base system on i386 iirc
[02:27:49] <kakuhen> i recall at one point the openbsd guys wanting to move to tcc from gcc but it didnt work for some archs
[02:27:55] <hays> Noisytoot: adfeno: I guess I read this https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html it seems like Debian hues much closer than Ubuntu
[02:29:02] <aggi> the compilers alone had potential to be 10x faster/more efficient as was shown with such free software projects, and j-core.org approaching free and open hardware (didn't succeed with replacing proprietary VHDL tooling)

[02:50:00] <adfeno> They are however not resilient to that very first step, so this is where we get stuck.
[02:50:48] <adfeno> I know an influential Debian maintainer from Brazil who is also against that first step.

[02:52:47] <madage> aggi, jxself, Alicia: If I'm not too far off on my reasoning, I think the point aggi is making is somewhat close to this: "nothing" is stopping anyone from studying binary blobs, reversing them and modifying them. But free software definition requires a source code as the prefered form to exercize computing freedoms and releasing only binary blobs or obfuscated code would be against users freedoms even if

[02:56:03] <madage> on the other hand, it is hard to draw a clear line if the complexity of code comes from deliberate choice to make things unmaneageable or if the problems they address are themselves complex
[02:57:29] <hays> right which is obviously not true of the linux kernel or of gcc
[02:57:39] <adfeno> madage: FSDG distros don't release only binary, always release source, but most also provide binaries.

[03:09:36] <ams> madage: the four freedoms don't mean that you must exercise those rights.

[03:10:03] <madage> ams: not must, but be capable is important, don't you think?
[03:10:05] <hays> I did--although I would not make the argument that gcc or linux code is too obfuscated as to not meet the definition of free software
[03:10:06] <ams> madage: it is similar to reading or writing skills .. just because you have learnt to read or write, doesn't mean that you will or must become an author of a book.
[03:10:13] <ams> madage: no, i don't.
[03:11:03] <ams> madage: similarly, you have the freedom to learn to fix an engine, you don't need, or must.  but you can, if you so choose too.. and can learn that skill, if you wish.  or you can get someone to do it for you .. just like with free software.
[03:11:17] <hays> madage: i think its deeper than that. the user experience has to be designed with them in mind, which is mostly is not
[03:12:08] <hays> most writing free software are doing it for themselves. a much smaller group of them is doing it for some community of technologists, and then a very much smaller set is actually thinking about the average user
[03:12:56] <hays> that bridge is currently gapped by for-profit companies, some of whom are better behaved than others of course
[03:13:15] <madage> ams: good point and on that, some engines now require such a high level of technical expertise that you cannot hope to get them fixed by any mechanic
[03:13:28] <ams> i beg to differ.
[03:13:44] <hays> some engines can't be fixed because there is too much proprietary software
[03:13:47] <ams> the reason why you cannot get them fixed by any mechanic is that most companies keep alot of what goes on in the engine a seekret.
[03:14:07] <jxself> But with free software the full engine is expose; it's only your knowledge that's needed.
[03:14:20] <ams> or someone else, who has put in the time and effort for it.
[03:14:45] <aggi> madage, i too referred to source-based distros specifically in conjunction with harmful bloat which prevents to exercise software freedom

[03:15:28] <aggi> the reason FSF and industry cannot draw a line anymore is simply because the demarcation line into non-free territory was crossed a decade or two ago already
[03:15:33] <hays> madage: why imaginary users and not real users
[03:15:53] <hays> madage: I think there is some brilliant software written by people for themselves, for sure
[03:16:12] <madage> hays: because one does not _know_ users minds, they can only infer and imagine what they want
[03:16:18] <hays> i mean.  unix as a concept
[03:16:20] <ams> here is a good essay .. https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html
[03:16:22] <madage> but this _want_ is conditioned over time
[03:16:33] <ams> or short story.
[03:16:52] <ams> yo ucan replace book with just about anything intangible
[03:17:12] <hays> madage: nahh, you can go talk to real users and get an idea of what they want. that's not imaginary. i don't think we need to hew so philosophically into the unknowabilty of others' experiences. humans are social creatures and can do this
[03:17:24] <aggi> furthermore the industry simply has no interest in specific projects which had demonstrated possibilities, (j-core.org, portable c compiler, tiny c compiler etc.)
[03:17:41] <hays> unix as a concept is brilliant--written for and by technologist

[03:19:45] <ams> which people?
[03:19:54] <ams> i can think of plenty of better systems than unix
[03:20:14] <ams> and i can think of plenty reasons why unix has reduced the freedom of computer users
[03:20:15] <madage> hays: you will then have some measure of some particular users you interviewed, but I digress.. my point is I became convinced that people excel when trying to resolve their own problems, not the problems they imagine or surveyed other have
[03:20:40] <madage> and by doing so they put a barrier to knowledge
[03:20:42] <hays> ams ritchie, thompson, others
[03:20:57] <ams> hays: ok? and why are they great exactly?
[03:21:00] <madage> LISP?
[03:21:28] <madage> I thought GNU was supposed to be a LISP Machine
[03:21:29] <ams> hays: or rather, why does their opinion on what makes a good operating system matter?
[03:21:43] <aeth> only GNU Emacs
[03:22:26] <aggi> this would be a dream of freedom: a JIT compiled system boot, free and open source VHDL compiler ready at hand to updated the FPGA, a sane compiler suite... none of which GNU/FSF could provide (no offense or blame intended)
[03:22:47] <ams> hays: C is a bug ridden language for example, and that has always been the case.  unix has prefered simplicity over user interface.  and we are still toddling around with a  tty ..
[03:22:48] <hays> ams: because the principles were used to build the modern tech stack as we know it?
[03:23:02] <ams> hays: absolute nonsense.
[03:23:07] <Alicia> writing software for yourself means you'll thoroughly test it too, and there's no guesswork for what will be "userfriendly" when the user is you. But general "userfriendliness" is very useful if you desire wider adoption of your software

[03:30:53] <jxself> Where's my PDP-10?
[03:30:59] <ams> hays: i'd also recommend taking a look at smalltalk, oberon, lisp machines, its, multics, and a slew of other systems before exalting unix.  there was plenty of better things before, and after.
[03:31:26] <hays> Alicia: i don't mean to discount the quality of software that is produced in an ontological bubble of any size, but I do think this approach will limit one's reach
[03:31:41] <adfeno> Although I do like some concepts addressed by Unix and POSIX, I find that they are somewhat limiting, this is why I foster GNU, because GNU's Not Unix.

[03:32:49] <ams> great for you, i think? not sure why it matters.
[03:33:34] <hays> i guess i feel a bit condescended to--you are mostly telling me to get educated on the topic we are discussing rather than engaging
[03:34:29] <hays> Smalltalk was really cool. But objects are a problem.

[03:37:10] <hays> i mean, smalltalk as a language was interesting and quite cool. and less error-prone than C  in practice. Building unix with C... yeah these people weren't language designers they were system designers.. different field of study
[03:37:50] <hays> and as "bad" as C is... it was efficient at a time when computing was expensive, and it was good enough. 
[03:38:49] <adfeno> I personally hate languages in which the things are dereferenced by default and which have strong type definitions.
[03:39:22] <hays> I kind of hope that Rust dislodges C as the lingua franca of system design (kernel space)

[03:43:58] <adfeno> This is the same issue that made Replicant remove Fdroid.
[03:43:59] <ams> right, so _where_ isn't the issue.
[03:44:06] <ams> it is _what_.
[03:45:03] <hays> I am just not educated on this particular tension. I was speaking above about Rusts technical merits. More specifically, they are trying to solve safety at a language level which is so important
[03:45:11] <Alicia> where matters, but it matters to FSDG-compliance, not to software freedom itself
[03:45:13] <aggi> Holy-C didn't require any fancy macro language for a build system at all either, yet the Holy-C system lacked revision control, a log-structured filesystem to be perfect
[03:45:24] <ams> hays: such saftey issues where already solved before C :)
[03:45:54] <hays> ehh only at a theoretical level--those languages were extremely hard to work with
[03:45:56] <adfeno> Alicia: yes, I agree, but cargo seems to come with Rust by default
[03:46:19] <hays> I mean.. lisp. what a beautiful language
[03:46:36] <ams> hays: ok, that is again absolute nonsense.
[03:46:54] <ams> there was nothing theoretical or hard to work with lisp.
[03:47:01] <Alicia> adfeno: yeah I believe so. it seems to be an odd combination of package manager+build system. Two things that absolutely do not belong together IMO
[03:47:20] <hays> ams: i don't think so. I've tried to write in at leat one of the provably correct languages and it was not something that you can expect software developers to do.
[03:48:12] <ams> hays: so before we continue, we need to make sure we are discussing at least similar centuries.
[03:48:20] <ams> hays: what lisp, and what c?
[03:48:21] <ams> which year.

[03:49:43] <ams> ok, maybe you did.  but it was not magical.
[03:50:02] <ams> and lisp was definitly not a functional language, much code was infact go-to.
[03:50:02] <hays> ugh. nothing is magical. but there is a wizard on the cover
[03:50:28] <hays> and his lectures make particular allusions to wizardry, so sorry for the historical reference
[03:50:38] <adfeno> Alicia: I think that is the one.
[03:50:44] <Alicia> ah
[03:50:56] <ams> ok, sicp is from 85, lisp had existed for afew years before that, as a system language.
[03:50:57] <adfeno> But investigation must be done yet.
[03:51:05] <Alicia> *nods*
[03:51:32] <hays> what made lisp and maybe a better example is scheme great, was that it treated funtions as first order abstrations, and it had possibly the simplest syntax possible for a language
[03:51:34] <ams> sicp while a great book, is also uninteresting from a system perspective, since it hides to much.
[03:51:34] <adfeno> … and also some lobbying to ensure that the so called Rust Foundation doesn't make things worse.
[03:52:21] <adfeno> Alicia: bone-baboon and others may need people working on some of the stuff.
[03:52:46] <ams> hays: you ealise that the whole notion of functional programming in lisp is a recent idea?

[03:57:00] <hays> lisp and scheme were interpreted, but they had a very efficient interpreter
[03:57:06] <ams> hays: no, they where not.
[03:57:34] <ams> lisp (and even scheme) where compiled languages from the start.

[04:02:19] <ams> (which was used for system level programming that is... not toys)
[04:02:49] <ams> the main reason was simply that memory was expensive.. compiled code takes less memory.
[04:03:45] <ams> the compilers for lisp where also quite featureful, and did lots of optimizations that came very late for C (for example)
[04:04:07] <hays> of course. I am not sure why I believed that.

[07:51:58] <hays> does this summarize the issues with Rust https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:main:rusts_freedom_flaws
[07:52:34] <jxself> It's unclear, as Mozilla no longer owns the trademarks but the Rust Foundation.
[07:53:21] <hays> so fsf wants people to have the right to modify Rust and still call it Rust
[07:53:35] <hays> do i understand the issue?
[07:54:21] <aggi> i don't fully
[07:54:27] <jxself> No.
[07:54:28] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
[07:54:33] <jxself> "...it is acceptable for the license to require that you change the name of the modified version, remove a logo, or identify your modifications as yours. As long as these requirements are not so burdensome that they effectively hamper you from releasing your changes, they are acceptable; you're already making other changes to the program, so you won't have trouble making a few more."
[07:55:09] <aggi> what happened if anyone modified rust, or implemented a gcc-frontend for it, yet didn't call it rust, did this violate anything?
[07:55:40] <jxself> The problem raised by the Mozilla trademark policy was that it included actual distribution restrictions. Distribution is normally an area for copyright, not trademark. Not surprisingly, extending trademarks into an area they don't normally cover created problems.
[07:56:31] <jxself> But now that the Rust Foundation owns the trademarks, what will the policy by there?
[07:56:34] <jxself> Per https://github.com/rust-lang/foundation-faq-2020/issues/35 "The foundation will be reviewing the trademark policy, but it will ultimately be up to the board to decide the terms that are selected."
[07:57:01] <hays> still not sure i understand the distinction
[07:57:42] <aggi> trademark policies are in conflict with distribution, got that. yet what are the legal issues with modifying rust and renaming that? this certainly would too violate something, wouldn't it?
[07:58:46] <aggi> so the rust people poison free software by smearing dependencies into the trees, create a hard vendor lockin, and prevent distribution of the software (such as python cryptography module being rustified), besides other severe technical issues.
[07:59:03] *** Quits: aHick (~memes@71.219.140.108) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:00:17] <jxself> Refer back to the Free Software Definition where "t is acceptable for the license to require that you change the name of the modified version, remove a logo, or identify your modifications as yours. As long as these requirements are not so burdensome that they effectively hamper you from releasing your changes, they are acceptable; you're already making other changes to the program, so you won't have trouble 
[08:00:23] <jxself> making a few more."
[08:00:57] <jxself> If the Rust Foundation were to say that modified versions could not be called Rust, would a problem exist? Where would the conflict be? If the Foundation required the modified version to be renamed and if the Free Software Definition says such a requirement is okay for a modified version, where would a conflict exist?
[08:01:21] <aggi> it is not that simple jxself, since i am almost certain original rust source licenses (like any other), insist retaining the original license including authors and copyright note mentioned
[08:02:05] <jxself> It's not clear that anyone proposed to remove the license, author names or copyright notices? Is that actually a plan?
[08:03:03] <jxself> I'm thinking like Trisquel's Abrowser, which is a modified Firefox. It says Abrowser everywhere. The original license, author names and copyright notices are still intact as per the license requirements.
[08:03:37] <aggi> good question what renaming a project implies and if this is permitted (4 clause bsd), meaning license demands retaining the name, yet trademark policy forbids distribution
[08:04:10] <jxself> Not necessarily a "name" but usually: License copies, copyright notices.
[08:05:15] <hays> what exactly is prevented that isn't prevented from a simple requirement to not redistribute modified code with the same name?
[08:06:24] <aggi> not sure, if it is permitted to redistribute a modification with a different name, which is problematic too anyway.
[08:06:56] <jxself> The requirement to change the name of a modified version, from my point of view, usually comes because something like: The upstream people don't want to be blamed for problems that the person modifying introduces. Or maybe they don't want people thinking that this modified version actually is *their original* program.
[08:07:29] <aggi> or, short question: is it permitted currently to implement and distribute a gcc rust-frontend however it is called later?
[08:07:31] <jxself> Imagine: "Wow, this browser is really horrible. Is this the kind of quality software that Mozilla puts out? This is awful."
[08:07:56] <aggi> mozilla browsers are, well, horrible
[08:08:04] <jxself> That's beside the point :)
[08:08:36] <jxself> Trademarks are supposed to identify a source, and maybe they don't want your changes to be connected with them.
[08:08:43] <hook54321> i think requiring a company name to be removed from the name is completely reasonable. i don't have a strong opinion on it other than that. but i think requiring a name change for small changes and upstream maintainers being blamed for problems in forks are both annoying issues.
[08:09:45] <jxself> The problem presented by Mozilla's trademark policy is that it required renaming before even sharing copies that have not been changed in any way.
[08:09:55] <jxself> Thinkf of Freedom #2 to make identical copies.
[08:10:10] <jxself> Gone.
[08:10:11] <hook54321> ah, yeah, that's definitely an issue.
[08:10:52] <hays> jxself: it does? 
[08:12:02] <hook54321> lots of distros regularly modify programs, and imo requiring the name to be changed for that can be burdensome.
[08:12:21] <jxself> Their goal is to prevent people from charging for copies, which the Free Software Definition says you should be able to do.
[08:12:49] <jxself> "Freedom to distribute (freedoms 2 and 3) means you are free to redistribute copies, either with or without modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to anyone anywhere. Being free to do these things means (among other things) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission to do so."
[08:13:30] <AppleGNU> this is straining out a gnat to swallow a camel 
[08:13:36] <jxself> https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/trademarks/distribution-policy/
[08:13:44] <jxself> "You may not charge for the software."
[08:13:52] <aggi> the freedom to distribute as mentioned too is in conflict with other laws regardless of mozilla policies

[08:15:54] <aggi> while the non-commercial distribution policy of mozilla could be somewhat reasonable at least
[08:16:20] <jxself> Except https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
[08:16:29] <jxself> "“Free software” does not mean “noncommercial”. On the contrary, a free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution."
[08:16:49] <jxself> They also have things like "When distributing you must distribute the most recent version of Firefox and other Mozilla software." That seems an interesting thing to think on as well. So your ability to distribute some version automatically terminates just because a new version comes along?
[08:17:17] <aggi> not unconditionally jxself, which is outside the scope of GPL, but may concern labor market legislation, authors' rights etc...
[08:17:22] <jxself> That makes me think of the part of the Free Software Definition that "In order for these freedoms to be real, they must be permanent and irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong; if the developer of the software has the power to revoke the license, or retroactively add restrictions to its terms, without your doing anything wrong to give cause, the software is not free."
[08:18:12] <AppleGNU> What does the clause "without your doing anything wrong..." mean?
[08:18:17] <aggi> and this phrasing is not in compliance with berne convention and german law, i think
[08:18:31] <aggi> an author cannot terminate his own rights even if he wanted to
[08:18:46] *** Joins: loworderbit (~dave@S0106e81cba1736ea.ss.shawcable.net)
[08:18:46] <jxself> It's a reference to some thing like the GPL where the rights granted terminate if you for example don't share source code.
[08:19:03] <hays> hmm i don't know if i am too dense or what, but i just still don't know what the actual problem is
[08:19:25] <jxself> But the case of Mozilla it'd be hard to point to the user having done something wrong merely because a new version came out and nothing else happened.
[08:20:09] <jxself> I can continue distributing old versions of unaltered GCC for as long as I want, even if it's been superseded by a new version.
[08:20:49] <jxself> There are plenty of good reasons to allow this too.
[08:21:15] <jxself> But in short Mozilla's trademark problem has multiple problems - this isn't even all of them.
[08:22:06] <jxself> But does it actually apply to Rust? That seem unclear since the Mozilla Foundation no longer owns the Rust trademarks but the Rust Foundation does and they've not yet said what they'll be doing. This seems like a good time to have a conversation with them about the concerns.
[08:23:04] <damo22> even if we rename rust to crust, its not going to solve the problem that the language is unstable
[08:23:29] <jxself> Stability of the language seems a technical issue though.
[08:23:36] <aggi> rust is extremely problematic, since they have begun to vendor lock-in in python territory already, at least they tried; too this affects the compiler, and someone mentioned grub was infected already too
[08:24:01] <damo22> yes i am referring to technical issues that would prevent us from even wanting to use it
[08:24:16] <hays> can you explain the problem without using the word "problematic" and replacing it with a real problem?
[08:25:21] <jxself> Okay: Your 4 freedoms are compromised. You cann't exercise all of freedom #2 (it only applies non-commerically), and that non-commercial part of freedom #2 is revoked as soon as a new version comes out.
[08:25:53] <jxself> So you have maybe 3 freedoms.
[08:25:58] <jxself> Or maybe 3.5, depending on how you count.
[08:26:01] <damo22> hays: if the programming language syntax is not completed, and they add more to it, it means you cant use an old rust compiler to compile a newer version of code written in rust, so why bother
[08:26:28] <aggi> (side note: i am having a problem with commercialisation without compensating authors for their work, that's the point!)
[08:26:38] <AppleGNU> You have all 4 with your own compiled versions.
[08:26:54] <AppleGNU> So long as you use their flag to remove branding 
[08:27:23] <damo22> who even wants a compiler that goes out of date next week
[08:27:40] <jxself> It is possible to exercise fredom #3 to make a modified version that removes the branding, which is what people like those behind GNU IceCat do.
[08:27:59] <jxself> But the topic has been about the status as the software comes from Mozilla.
[08:28:11] <jxself> https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/gnu-linux-libre/2011-08/msg00014.html

Then groups like the Mozilla or Rust foundations could use a trade mark policy that they know will not cause problem for the free software community. It would also save the work of

I was about to post in the FSF Associate Member Forum a question about what had the meeting that took place on May 27 had decided when I discovered https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-and-gnu-move-official-irc-channels-to-libera-chat-network  
[09:49:10] <digitalilliterat> And reading that brought me here. 
[09:50:32] <digitalilliterat> As a matter of fact, if I could choose the topic of the day I would choose some topic related to digital illiteracy.

[10:42:14] <digitalilliterat> I wrote "people who have the same feelings and who is willing to help him" and I should have written "people who have the same feelings and who are willing to help him"
[10:48:19] <digitalilliterat> I must leave you now. Thank you for your time. I must find the way to solve a hardware problem that is threatening me. I feel that If I don't solve it correctly I will be dragged out of the FSF community and that is something I will sincerely regret.

[21:09:35] <oaken-source> keyboards: references usually means somebody who they can contact to ask about your qualifications
[21:10:10] <oaken-source> so contact information, basically. of people you have worked with, or maybe teachers, anyone who can judge your fit to the internship on some relevant criteria
[21:10:51] <oaken-source> so for example, if you're currently still in school, and you're doing computer science classes, you could ask your teacher if they would offer to be a reference for you
[21:11:18] <oaken-source> the important part is that you should ask people first, before you note them as a reference.
[21:11:28] <keyboards> yea
[21:11:34] <oaken-source> if you don't ask them first, that can be considered rude.

[21:12:41] <oaken-source> maybe the head of a local free software group / linux club / etc that you're active in?
[21:12:54] *** Parts: lacroix (dlacroix@about/linux/staff/lacroix) ()
[21:13:01] <oaken-source> you must have some contact with free software people if you're looking for an internship with the fsf :)
[21:13:31] <oaken-source> maybe the lead dev of a software project you contributed to?
[21:13:47] <keyboards> i'm not active in any of those, have extensively worked many proprietary softwares
[21:14:09] <keyboards> but none would be interested for that
[21:14:17] <oaken-source> I see.
[21:14:37] <oaken-source> employers maybe?
[21:15:18] <oaken-source> in the professional work environment, team leads or employers are usually pretty good people to list as references
[21:15:44] <keyboards> not in contact "employers maybe?"
[21:17:21] <alyx> ^
[21:17:41] <alyx> generally previous employers/supervisors; commonly professors if you've just out of academia 
[21:17:59] <keyboards> can ask my X-CTO and XX-CTO but that may or may not work.
[21:20:00] <balrog> [12:43:47] <keyboards> i'm not active in any of those, have extensively worked many proprietary softwares
[21:20:05] <keyboards> they use free software but don't contribute for it in there life time.
