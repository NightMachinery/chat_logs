[03:38:14] <johncs> bookworm i think you're saying we need to do this for security reasons, but i'm not quite following your description. where is the old release forcing the usage of python2 and what's the issue with tar?
[03:39:15] <bookworm> it needs python 2 as it forces a specific node-pre-gyp version. tar is broken in the version we have. We also have some other things but those were the immediate warnings that a build emitted
[03:39:22] <bookworm> I plan to fix the rest as well
[03:40:12] <bookworm> but considering the rest of the ecosystem I *really* don't want a python 2 dep

[03:51:24] <johncs> looks good bookworm. there's not many changes since the last release which makes this off-release-dependency feel a lot safer.
[03:51:49] <bookworm> well, honestly I'm rather annoyed at them for not bumping the version
[03:52:05] <bookworm> it's been way too long, I consider the lib dead by now
[03:52:07] <johncs> yeah seriously, security updates are a great reason for cutting a release
[03:53:13] <bookworm> shouldn't brick any builds, we run tests
[03:53:47] <bookworm> it's green on 3 Oses and at least 3 node versions so...

[05:00:04] <d76d5436757> bookworm: I have a question for TL. How do I have the frontend run this bit of JavaScript `socket.emit("auth:perform", {"user": "", "password": ""})` on the sign-in page load if a config value is set?
[05:00:28] <d76d5436757> for my SSO PR, I have the backend working. I just now need a way to send a login request so that everything works

[05:01:37] <bookworm> what do you mean by "if a config value is set"?
[05:02:17] <d76d5436757> ah sorry, I meant that in the config.js of the app, if a boolean value is true, run this bit of javascript on the login page load
[05:04:31] *** justache is now known as justGhost
[05:06:45] <bookworm> you're conditional should just be based on the bool flag of your authheader, defaulting to false
[05:07:30] <bookworm> if the admin tells you to trust the header just do it. If there's no proxy that's irrelevant
[05:07:47] <bookworm> your*
[05:09:15] <bookworm> as for your question... you'd need to template the client code when you first send it to the client, same as the index page
[05:09:42] <bookworm> or you make the client understand some option event and send that after sending it the code

[05:21:18] <bookworm> what is that? vscode fork of sqlite3?
[05:21:23] <johncs> yes
[05:21:37] <johncs> i saw mention of it when i was digging through sqlite3's status earlier today too
[05:21:52] <bookworm> they are an even worse upstream as they made no comment that they want to have that for anyone else but them

[05:22:20] <johncs> gotcha, i'll trust you. was just curious

[10:51:10] <fnutt> luser1: I experienced issues with large sqlite db before as well due to Google Cloud Always Free VPS.
[10:51:23] <fnutt> But it became way way better when they upgraded their free cpus.
[10:51:52] <fnutt> If you experience trouble at 1.2 GB sqlite file, you might want to actually consider a free VPS instead.

[15:20:22] <bookworm> docker always needs root, doesn't mean you run TL as root though inside of the container

[15:22:27] <jelbo> Ok.. I don't know a lot about Docker, I mostly have linuxserver.io images that allow me to pass a PUID and PGID of a user account
[15:23:39] <bookworm> if you use "our" container you really don't have to worry about it, it's already setup for you
[15:23:55] <jelbo> Ok, I am using the official one, yeah
[15:24:28] <jelbo> The only 'problem' I see now is that the folder I mapped to /var/opt/thelounge is owned by 0000
[15:24:38] <jelbo> Eh, 1000
[15:25:14] <bookworm> and that's a problem why?
[15:25:28] <bookworm> you should not mess with those files outside of the container
[15:25:49] <jelbo> I'd like to be able to edit the config file for example
[15:26:06] <bookworm> then shell into the container
[15:26:33] <jelbo> Ah, I see. But not as root?
[15:27:30] <jelbo> I used root in the container shell so far to create a user account for me and to install some themes

[18:09:25] <bookworm> I could but I don't quite see what the benefit would be. The discussion isn't whether test fail or not but rather if the approach is the right one or not
[18:10:39] <bookworm> you seemed to have ignored my comment that it might be better to makes this pluggable and just implemented the approach that works for you but fails for many token based approaches I think (can't really do challenge response can you?)
[18:12:12] <bookworm> and you still have the conditional with the rev proxy in there, despite me telling you that that's not what you should be doing (in my view) without any reasoning which makes me somehow wonder if you'd read my comments at all
[18:14:16] <bookworm> I appreciate your efforts, certainly good to have some idea of what you're trying to achieve but I think just enumerating some common auth protocols and looking at what they might need would be a thing we should do first (again, my view on the matter)

As for the response with garbage, I will see if I can change it. I just wanted to send something valid(ish) so that I wouldn't have to worry about null values (even if the strings are empty). The authentication is done in the headers of
[18:32:07] <d76d5436757> the upgrade of the web socket, so regardless of what information is passed to the auth endpoint, it will log in as the user. As for whether HTTP header auth is relevant, it would support every other web-based auth provider too (given that the reverse proxy is properly configured) with minimal effort in implementation and maintenance.

[19:31:16] <d76d5436757> Furthermore, popular authentication methods running without a proxy that handles it (such as bare SSO via SAML or OpenID would be much more complex to implement in TL since authentication is done via HTTP and not via WS. This would require handling another endpoint that could send information back and forth between the server and client, requiring
[19:31:16] <d76d5436757> the use of another websocket. Header based authentication is, by comparison, much easier to maintain and also has more features.
[19:31:25] *** Joins: dgw (dgw@sopel/admin/dgw)
[19:32:35] <bookworm> oauth 2 is just a header as well, most things in the end are. The question is how and when a handshake happens (or not) and how to enforce auth
[19:33:14] <bookworm> oauth and some other stuff just uses authorization: bearer $token
[19:33:26] <bookworm> the tricky part is the handshake
[19:33:50] <bookworm> as said, let's collect a bunch of the common auth methods and look at what they need

[19:35:49] <bookworm> as for sending something that's garbage, that's actually the wrong way. If you still access the user / pw you *want* to blow up as that is invalid to do
[19:36:08] <bookworm> if you read it and continue you propagate garbage through lower layers
[19:36:26] <bookworm> the one thing that knows what it is should also sanitize it
[19:36:37] *** Joins: denningsrogue (~denningsr@98.97.131.238)
[19:39:00] <bookworm> what we have to be careful about is how this interacts if you set the socketio transports to websocket first, or only websocket. As you can't actually send a header from browser based js
[19:39:29] <bookworm> but I don't know how the upgrade process works to be honest
[19:39:59] <thelounge1071> Hi there! I've been using thelounge for some months now and I'm very happy with it, however, in the past few weeks i noticed that it's been disconnecting and reconnecting from networks randomly, sometimes multiple times a minute. As of ~10 minutes ago this actually resulted in a ban from Libera Chat for flooding. The error on the server tab is
[19:39:59] <thelounge1071> ECONNRESET. Internet was not down, the container in which is running was fine, all system resources are fine. The logs from thelounge do not provide any info. Is there a way I cana debug this?
[19:40:03] <bookworm> (or rather what the protocol allows you to do if you refuse and what the client hello is)

[19:41:15] <bookworm> thelounge1071: TL tells you in the server buffer why it disconnected I think, might be the network layer
[19:41:52] <bookworm> if it just says ping timeout or connection reset by peer or some such well then it lost connection for some reason
[19:42:56] <bookworm> that reason being somewhere between you and the server generally (unless you run TL on a toaster and it didn't process messages fast enough to respond to pings from the server)

[19:44:45] <thelounge1071> bookworm: the only thing in the log is this `Connection closed unexpectedly: Error: read ECONNRESET`, but again, the connection should be absolutely fine
[19:45:17] <bookworm> yeah it should
[19:45:28] <bookworm> apparently it wasn't though
[19:46:59] <bookworm> your error tells you that the remote end hung up if my understanding is correct though

[21:34:34] <d76d5436757> bookworm: OpenID (the successor to oauth2) actually uses parameters in the request to send information (moving away from a header). Furthermore, SAML (another popular authentication method) uses a form post to send information between the provider and the application. Both of these would require a lot more work to implement compared to header based
[21:34:34] <d76d5436757> authentication. A popular homelab/selfhost authentication program is Authelia which also uses header based auth
