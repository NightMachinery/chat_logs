[02:16:46] <bananahead> Hi all. I am using a ModelForm to edit an instance. One of the fields is a ForignKey which utilises the ModelChoiceField. When it renders it works okay, if I use the "to_field_name" attribute, the field does not populate with the instance value when editing, and reverts to blank. Anyone have any ideas why this could be happening?
[02:17:33] <pembo13> bananahead, can you share the code where "to_field_name" is?
[02:19:14] <bananahead> pembo13: do you want the form code? or how I am instantiating the form itself?

[08:37:22] <beastDivision> AugustusCaesar24: there are two issues here
[08:37:36] <AugustusCaesar24> lets go over them one at a time then
[08:37:45] <AugustusCaesar24> I am listening
[08:38:52] <beastDivision> one, your image is probably already closed to optimized in terms of compression, but you wont know for sure till fixing the second part, the bigger one is that you are saving the compressed output to the same buffer that you got the original from, which is why it is approximately twice the size as the original, so your .save( needs to be putting it into a different file, a different bytes object
[08:38:57] <beastDivision> see this github https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/5587
[08:39:12] <beastDivision> close to *
[08:43:39] <AugustusCaesar24> oh I seen some people use    io.BytesIo    but wasn't sure what it was for
[08:43:52] <AugustusCaesar24> okay I'll try to find out how I can make that happen
[08:43:57] <AugustusCaesar24> I have been working on this for a couple of hours now, I am at a point where I can't tell whats up or down.
[08:46:29] <beastDivision> yeah, just save it to a new file / bytes / whatever kind of object, also pay attention to the format, some like .png dont really compress much, where as jpeg does. but also don't blindly convert everything to a jpeg either, certain things like vector art, text, fine lines look horrific after compression in jpeg, etc. different formats for different kinds of pictures exist for a reason
[08:47:30] *** Quits: schinckel (uid38120@id-38120.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[08:48:41] <AugustusCaesar24> I am only allowing for jpeg, png, and gif so don't have a whole lot to worry about
[08:49:21] <AugustusCaesar24> I was going to save everything to a jpeg because that compresses more, but I really like how png can have transparency so I am kind of keeping all files as their original format
[08:49:43] <beastDivision> yeah, that's the best way to handle it most of the time

[09:49:10] <AugustusCaesar24> gotcha
[09:49:15] <AugustusCaesar24> Thank you so much!
[09:50:13] <AugustusCaesar24> I just tried the code you sent and it didn't compress the image, but I think maybe I am saving it wrong or something, but I think I'll just work on something else for now because this is taking too much time
[09:54:31] <beastDivision> pay very close to the file size too, if you're using an already compressed image, you may get very little to no compression at all
[09:56:22] <AugustusCaesar24> the way I am overwriting the image is like this:                             updated_form.form_image.file.image = get_compressed_image(updated_form.form_image)
[09:56:28] <AugustusCaesar24> thats correct right?
[10:05:49] <beastDivision> AugustusCaesar24: there's probably more than one way to do it, but you probably wanna use this

[13:50:50] <CapnKernel> Hello.  I'm using Django 3.2.10.  I have a class called Person that I want to use as a custom user model with django-allauth.
[13:51:00] <CapnKernel> If Person is derived from AbstractUser, things work ok.  Person.objects.all() returns all active users.
[13:51:12] <CapnKernel> Now, I want a separate model where I can park inactive and deceased persons (ie, I don't want queries on Person with the default manager to retrieve them).  These inactive members don't need to be able to log in.
[13:51:37] <CapnKernel> So, Person and InactivePerson have pretty much the same set of fields.  Looking in the Django docs at model inheritance, I should be able to make an abstract base class called BasePerson.  I can then have "class Person(AbstractUser, BasePerson)" and "class InactivePerson(Person)".
[13:51:50] <CapnKernel> The problem is that "manage.py check" is reporting errors ("qado" is the app name):
[13:51:58] <CapnKernel> qado.InactivePerson: (models.E005) The field 'email' from parent model 'qado.person' clashes with the field 'email' from parent model 'qado.person'.
[13:52:05] <CapnKernel> qado.Person.email: (models.E006) The field 'email' clashes with the field 'email' from model 'qado.person'.
[13:52:12] <CapnKernel> Are these problems fixable?  Should I show some code?  What's the next step?

[16:40:55] <CapnKernel> moldy: OMG you are probably right, I'll have a look
[16:43:04] <CapnKernel> moldy: That's made models.E005 go away, but now there are many errors about reverse accessors that need a related_name.  Will poke around to try and fix that.  models.E006 is still there.
[16:43:14] <CapnKernel> Thank you for your help!
[16:43:34] <moldy> CapnKernel: those can usually be fixed by setting related_name on the related models
[16:43:58] <moldy> it might be easier to help if we see your models and the full error messages

[18:26:10] <PomeloEU> Hi, I'm a bit confused about Django translations, I've read the docs, but maybe I'm missing something. I want to create the translations in one location instead of on an per-app basis. When I create a project/locale and makemessages it generates all messages there but the translations do not show up. When I have them in an app folder it does work, but I can't make messages if there is not a project/locale folder and I'm not
[18:26:10] <PomeloEU>  sure if that would only create messages for that specific app or all apps.
[18:26:40] <PomeloEU> I am trying to do this without setting LOCALE_PATHS by the way, as I try to keep everything in the default locations as mentioned in the docs

[18:37:06] <moldy> PomeloEU: you want to create the translations where exactly?
[18:37:33] <moldy> if you do not want to have them in apps, then you must set LOCALE_PATHS. that's what it's there for.
[18:37:37] <PomeloEU> in the project root folder, i.e. project/locale/
[18:37:46] <moldy> PomeloEU: ok, then add that folder to LOCALE_PATHS
[18:37:54] <PomeloEU> ah ok
[18:38:17] <PomeloEU> and just to be sure: if I would place them in say my core app, it would not generate all messages, just the ones for that specific app right?
[18:39:45] <moldy> i don't remember how makemessages works in this regard. i'd just test it :)
[18:42:00] <PomeloEU> okay I'll do that, thanks for pointing me in the right direction

[20:36:27] <bananahead> Does PDB work when using runserver, or is it just me having issues. I'm having an issue with kicking into pdub on when using docker. When I run tests it works fine, but runserver isnt having it
[20:47:37] <moldy> bananahead: pdb works fine for me with runserver, docker might be another thing though
[20:56:28] <dang`r`us> I think you need remote debugging with docker
[20:56:35] <dang`r`us> PyCharm has it working out of the box IIRC
[20:57:29] <bananahead> it was my issue. I was using docker up, which by nature is not interactive.
[20:57:59] <bananahead> I mean - docker-compose up
[20:58:32] <bananahead> I should have used docker-compose run --service-ports app_name, which will give me the desired output
