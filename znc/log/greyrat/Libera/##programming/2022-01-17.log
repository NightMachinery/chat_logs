[02:35:53] <ProfSimm> sonny: it's a bit too close to C++
[02:36:14] <sonny> yeah, but I'm not sure why that is a problem
[02:36:38] <sonny> see Java success
[02:36:43] <epony> everything is a better C-like language, that's why it's capabilities and features change C++ over time to support that as extensions
[02:37:03] <epony> "its" advantage gets ported and supported
[02:37:32] <ProfSimm> sonny: Java has success precisely because it wasn't C++
[02:37:35] <sonny> I've already pretty much figured out what makes a good systems language, it's not difficult
[02:37:58] <epony> so expect the concurrency of Go to find a "feature" and "capability" of C++ to warrant inclusion, for now, it's just a library for concurrent execution by the looks of it, one of the new and fancy trends on parallelism

[02:47:37] <flakland> wow the revolution is here
[02:47:58] <ProfSimm> flakland: the idea is to make this an implementation detail, so you can switch your layout at will, per field, and not change your code
[02:48:31] <flakland> i don't know
[02:48:35] <flakland> can you show an example of that
[02:48:36] <ProfSimm> Jai also can run itself entirely during compilation, instead of having a separate "macro" language
[02:48:45] <flakland> without changing my code

[04:51:26] <CppCon> a... buffer?
[04:51:26] <PlanckWalk> If you need character by character, just use get anyway unless you absolutely need something faster.
[04:51:54] <CppCon> fstream, right? use read()
[04:51:58] <wuldor2> It would be nice for it to not be too slow since it's for a game, I'm trying to parse a wav file.
[04:52:03] <wuldor2> Yes, fstream.
[04:52:06] <wuldor2> Alright, let's see.
[04:52:43] <PlanckWalk> For wav files you naturally have chunks anyway
[04:52:45] <CppCon> wav file? then you will read the header to get the metadata, and then read() big wave chunks
[04:53:05] <CppCon> or use my libjukebox in github
[04:53:11] <[itchyjunk]> For some reason, i still don't understand simply typed lambda calculus :(
[04:53:13] <PlanckWalk> You definitely don't want character reading for wav, it will be both slower and harder to write
[04:53:25] <CppCon> simple library that reads and plays many sound formats
[04:53:39] <wuldor2> Thanks, I'll ditch the library because that's not cool.
[04:54:14] <CppCon> it will save you time
[04:54:19] <CppCon> the library is well made and lightweight
[04:54:24] <CppCon> we made that for our tiny games
[04:54:34] <CppCon> tired of manually parsing shit
[04:54:51] <CppCon> needed a simple portable solution to just read and play sounds
[04:55:29] <CppCon> so we organized all our parsing code and wrapped up some other tiny libraries and packaged everything in a place that supports many input formats, including files, memory, streams, etc.
[04:55:54] <CppCon> oss, good code, works out of the box. I really recommend it
[04:56:06] <CppCon> just give us a star back and some feedback, perhaps :)
[04:56:16] <wuldor2> I'll give it a look, thanks. Still think I will write this just because I don't want to suck at code hehe

[05:33:46] <vdamewood> Inst: No, the horrible part of sexual harassment is being sexually harrassed.
[05:33:54] <[itchyjunk]> you want to for people to be equally attracted to everyone?
[05:33:58] <Inst> iirc there were sociological studies

[05:34:21] <Inst> women tend to construe being flirted with by undesirable men as sexual harassment, by desirable men less so

[07:47:32] <rindolf> ejjfunky: yu cannot
[07:47:34] <ejjfunky> i don't want others to access my backend api.
[07:47:34] <Rounin> ejjfunky: We~ll, the frontend should pass some kind of authentication to the backend
[07:47:37] <vdamewood> ejjfunky: For the most part, you can't.
[07:47:48] <ejjfunky> yea, thinking along that line, Rounin.
[07:48:09] <ejjfunky> except that, the authentication will be readable in the public too.
[07:48:17] <vdamewood> Rounin ejjfunky: You would need it to have some kind of challenge-response mechanism.
[07:48:24] <Rounin> ejjfunky: Like, I have a frontend that gets an authentication token from Azure AD... A kind of JWT token, as I recall... So the backend has some code that fetches a key from Microsoft and evaluates the token
[07:48:30] <rindolf> ejjfunky: devs can reverse engineer the front end
[07:48:50] <Rounin> ejjfunky: Right... So the source of the security in my case is Microsoft, since the frontend is an untrusted part in all this

[07:49:10] <Rounin> (The previous version indeed used a local server insted)
[07:50:01] <Rounin> Come to think of it, the frontend's just some untrusted JavaScript code running in someone's browser, so it might not be that important to know that it's coming from that specifically... Unless you're trying to prevent cheating in a game
[07:50:01] <amigojapan> ejjfunky: you could obfuscate the code if it is js
[07:50:05] <ejjfunky> but i think Rounin got the answer. it looks like jwt is the answer. combine that with https, it should be safe enough
[07:50:21] <Rounin> But yeah, access control should pass all the way through, anyway
[07:50:43] <ejjfunky> yea, i think obfuscate should work too. i dont want to bother with jwt since i got to set it up. way too complicated for my use case

[21:08:21] <kveroneau> Yeah, that's why a lot of modern languages have moved away from header files.
[21:08:24] <deniska> C is a really old language, targetting a somewhat flimsy computer, even by 70s standards
[21:08:39] <rindolf> tomathy: please apologise
[21:08:46] <deniska> I don't think any widespread language left using header files besides C and C++?
[21:08:46] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: a header means you know what functions there are and their signatures without actually having the code.
[21:08:56] <tomathy> rindolf: you first
[21:09:31] <[itchyjunk]> How is it possible to know the signature without code?
[21:09:35] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: by writing a header :)
[21:09:37] <rindolf> tomathy: sorry
[21:09:42] <[itchyjunk]> like java has abstract function with just a signature
[21:09:44] <kveroneau> bjs, yup that was the original idea behind header files, so the actual library can easily remain closed source.
[21:09:46] <tomathy> rindolf: sorry to you and your people
[21:09:52] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: a header is a separate file, that only contains the signature.  I give you the header,  but I don't give you the source
[21:09:54] <[itchyjunk]> or interface even
[21:10:13] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, but abstract class with only abstract method in java satisfies this ?
[21:10:14] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: then you can compile your code and check it, and then later on my function can get linked in
[21:10:37] <[itchyjunk]> or interface
[21:11:00] <rindolf> tomathy: no worries
[21:11:08] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: in java, a compiler artifact (.class file, perhaps packed in a .jar file) has enough information on how to use a function. With shared objects (think .dll or .so files) it's not the case

[21:11:57] <kveroneau> That's kind of why I love Pascal's unit method, a unit file in Pascal has two main sections, the "interface", which contains all the public stuff, the stuff you'd normally see in a .h file, then the other section "implementation" is well, the actual code.  Borland actually shared the interfaces to it's closed units by only providing the "interface"
[21:12:12] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm

[21:14:01] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[21:14:03] <bjs> but not as brutal as C's header files
[21:14:08] <kveroneau> Pascal was obviosuly onto something with this single unit file idea, as a lot of modern languages now use "imports" and such, which are similar in concept, but not as good, as with most modern languages, these imports don't have seperate "interface" and "implementation" sections. :(

[21:16:52] <kveroneau> Another cool part, at least with Borland's Pascal versions, is that a compiled unit file, is entirely self-contained.  A compiled unit file contains both the header, and the object code for the target in a single file, making it easy to move around, or even have a central directory on your dev box with a bunch of unit files, making compilation extremely fast when compared to the competition.

[21:18:08] <GeDaMo> Wirth carried that approach to modularity on with Modula and Oberon
[21:18:31] <kveroneau> Ah yes, I've been hearing quite a bit about Oberon actually.
[21:18:58] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: in some places pascal was a primary teaching programming language for a while. And when you think about it, the choice between pascal and C was more or less a coin toss at some point :)
[21:19:28] <kveroneau> [itchyjunk], lol, I'm not a kid.  And when you look at the binary size for a compiled go application, verses say a compiled FreePascal program... Well...
[21:19:32] <GeDaMo> Turbo Pascal was way ahead of PC C implementations when it came out
[21:19:50] <kveroneau> I think Pascal programs are much more optimized on the binary level than a Go program.
[21:19:58] <[itchyjunk]> Where is pascal used these days?
[21:20:10] <deniska> kveroneau: go includes a fairly hefty runtime statically by default
[21:20:15] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, were any OS'es written in Pascal?
[21:20:15] <kveroneau> When you need megabytes of compiled machine code to just print "Hello World", your compiler has some major issues.
[21:20:36] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: I think windows 1.0 was in pascal? :)
[21:20:42] <[itchyjunk]> oh really?

[21:21:09] <kveroneau> I believe the original Macintosh System Software was written in Pascal.  Apple used to be heavily invested in Pascal back in the day.
[21:21:15] <[itchyjunk]> maybe thats what happened. MS touched the language and everyone got spooked and ran away from it
[21:21:20] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: most OSes around that time were probably in assembly around that time, but pascal was fairly popular for userspace programs
[21:21:34] <kveroneau> A lot of Apple software was written in Pascal.  I believe the original PhotoShop was also written in Pascal.

[21:40:56] <kveroneau> It was definately more than that, and in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s, a lot of people obviously believed in the language.  A lot of programs during that era were written in either TurboPascal or Delphi.
[21:41:16] <apotheon> In the case of BASIC, that death sentence was deserved.  In the case of Pascal, it's debatable (because maybe getting killed off in popular programming culture is appropriate given the existence of Ada).  In the case of Logo, it's entirely undeserved.
[21:41:26] <kveroneau> Microsoft tried to compete with Borland many times, only to fail with anything other than BASIC product line.
[21:41:28] <novns> kveroneau, because there were no alternatives in the DOS world for example

[21:43:10] <kveroneau> I can agree with the harder to learn aspect for C.  In C, a lot of library functions seem to require pointers to be passed around, and strings in C were much more difficult to manage than strings in Pascal.
[21:43:10] <deniska> it became really hard to ask money for a compiler starting early 2000s
[21:43:17] <apotheon> Yeah, and I remember people saying things like "Why the hell would you use Pascal for that?"
[21:43:27] <apotheon> in the early 2000s
[21:43:38] <novns> deniska, we used Delphi "for free" those days
[21:43:53] <deniska> microsoft compiler became free, gcc became a viable thing outside linuxy-unixy world, why would you even bother looking up a delphi keygen? :)
[21:44:17] <novns> we used to buy cheap CDs with a lot of expensive software
[21:44:20] <kveroneau> I find that Pascal takes away many of the headaches C introduces, without any loss to binary optimizations.  At least that's why I continue to use ObjectPascal.
[21:44:26] <deniska> yeah, I remember that
[21:44:29] <rindolf> deniska: blame GNU...
[21:44:46] <InPhase> I recall at that time, like I think most people, not wanting to use a commercial compiler even if it was better, because it was more important to get comfortable with a compiler that you could always use on projects.

Having a language which is true to it's backwards compatibility is great from a code maintaince point of view.  You can still reap the benefits of the latest compiler with barely even having to update your code, which is getting more and more difficult these days.
[21:55:45] <InPhase> vdamewood: And in it, all data is stored in immutable objects which can receive messages for method calls, while the only structured flow control allowed is an if statement and a goto.

[22:14:03] <nomagno> Chromium + UBlock Origin + NoScript

[22:15:08] *** Quits: quartz (~quartz@user/quartz) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[22:15:10] <kveroneau> Not sure why most browsers do that, as the page itself doesn't really need JavaScript to work otherwise.
[22:15:13] <rindolf> react.js/etc. are leaky/quirky abstractions. devils' work
[22:15:13] <vdamewood> It's just an XML file with an XSLT stylesheet.
[22:16:00] <nomagno> I haven't really found a need to write JavaScript as anything more than hooks to HTML DOM events for my projects
[22:16:10] <kveroneau> I like that I can also just write native Markdown in my page inside an XML tag. :)
[22:16:15] <nomagno> Then again the only thing I've written recently is a control panel for my game
[22:16:25] <nomagno> that HTTP POSTs the input
[22:16:48] <apotheon> Maybe turning off JavaScript support has become generalized to turning off client-side scripting support.
[22:16:50] <austincheney> you can use css with XML: https://mailmarkup.org/mail-documentation.xsd
[22:16:51] <bayaz> Type: application/xml 
[22:16:53] <apotheon> . . . which is reasonable.

[22:17:26] <kveroneau> Oh that's cool.
[22:17:30] <austincheney> for some odd reason the cloud flare family safe DNS blocks that mailmarkup.org domain
[22:17:33] <apotheon> Ideally, there should be abilities to toggle separately.
[22:17:50] <apotheon> . . . but turning off both is better than not having a way to turn of XML+XSLT scripting.
[22:18:05] <nomagno> apotheon: It seems to not say JavaScript anywhere in the settings
[22:18:07] <nomagno> just 'script'
[22:18:13] <apotheon> there we go, then
[22:18:14] <nomagno> So I guess I will eat my implied words
[22:18:53] <vdamewood> kveroneau: Well, looks like your markdown support, at least, totally requires JavaScript.
[22:18:56] <kveroneau> XML isn't any worse than writting JSON, as long as you have an SGML editor to assist with tags, it all comes down to how the tags are defined in the XSLT stylesheet.

[22:19:04] <apotheon> The next question is "How do we prevent use of execution of the Turing-complete scripting capabilities of HTML+CSS?"
[22:19:05] <kveroneau> Yes, that is correct.
[22:19:31] <pulse> i'd rather use punch cards than torture myself with xml
[22:19:36] <apotheon> If you don't have a specialized editor, JSON is easier to write than XML.
[22:19:48] <apotheon> . . . and that's saying something, because JSON is fugly.
[22:19:55] <kveroneau> I specifically wrote this "kdocs" XSLT to be as user-friendly XML, similar to how you'd write a typical HTML page, but with simpler tags.
[22:20:06] <nomagno> apotheon: CSS requires user interaction to do anything useful, I think
[22:20:25] <nomagno> Just like HTML is technically a cellular automaton, but the 'electricity' is you clicking links
[22:20:30] * vdamewood forces pulse to write HTML on punch cards.
[22:20:32] <apotheon> nomagno: I read something somewhere about HTML+CSS now being a Turing complete combination.
[22:20:57] <apotheon> Each alone, however . . . not so much.
[22:20:58] <nomagno> apotheon: It's Turing complete, it's just semiautomatic
[22:21:04] * kveroneau still remembers when browsers finally passed the Acid CSS test suite.
[22:21:43] <apotheon> Yeah, then W3C said "We clearly have to make CSS more complicated if browsers can actually comply with the standard, with full support."
[22:21:47] * vdamewood still remembers when they didn't.
[22:21:51] <nomagno> apotheon: The only way to program Rule 110 on it thus far is to have the user / a mouse-controlling program click boxes

[22:52:39] <kveroneau> In Pascal, you can even declare a block of memory as absolute without needing to perform an allocation.  So, if you are programming an OS, and need to set some very specific memory addresses for I/O operations which are mapped to memory, this can be done in Pascal, as well as C of course.
