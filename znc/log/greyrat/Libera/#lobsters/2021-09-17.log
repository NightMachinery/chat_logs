[02:04:37] <riv> i find it hard to pick a mouse :(
[02:04:45] <riv> im looking for a good computer mouse with a good scroll wheel
[02:05:49] <Ticho> I have good experience with low mid tier gaming mice - not overly complex, but durable and precise enough for daily desktop use
[02:06:59] <riv> i had a bad (but funny) experience with gamer mouse - tried buying a random gamer mouse because it was cheap and I was curious
[02:07:21] <riv> i can't remember what the feature was but it literally had "DLC" that you had to pay extra to unlock after buying the mouse itself
[02:07:33] <Ticho> wow, that's rich :)

[02:11:44] *** Quits: seschwar (~seschwar@user/seschwar) (Quit: :wq)
[02:12:16] <Ticho> I'm currently happy with Logitech G400s, although the one single thing I find imperfect on it happens to be the scrollwheel :)
[02:12:39] <riv> ahhh
[02:12:51] <riv> what specifically?
[02:13:05] <Ticho> the sensor is a bit off sometimes, a single mechanical scroll step does not always produce a scroll step in the GUI
[02:13:22] <riv> thats exactly what i need to fix!
[02:13:35] <Ticho> but it might be because I have this compulsive tick when I'm reading something, I keep pressing the scroll wheel over and over again
[02:13:55] <Ticho> the imprecision started after maybe two or three years of use, so I don't really blame the mouse
[02:14:17] <mouseghost> fortran actually looks approachable. im so impressed
[02:14:19] <riv> yeah i guess that's ok
[02:15:21] <Ticho> other than that, this mouse has been absolutely great, unlike some of my previous mice, all of which had issues with left or right buttons after just a few weeks of use
[02:15:29] <drobilla> I've long been an ergo dork who scoffs at gamer toys, but Re: scroll wheels I have to say the optionally-detented wheel on the Logitech gaming mouses (or the G502 anyway) is pretty sweet
[02:15:37] <Ticho> I'm definitely buying a Logitech mouse when it's time to buy a new one
[02:16:08] <drobilla> If you end up needing to scroll over some massive thing, you can click it off and just spin the thing
[02:16:29] <mockturtle> Easy Type-Safe Integer Types In C++ [c++] (snej) https://lobste.rs/s/dblu7i
[02:18:13] <riv> well ill take a look at logitech
[02:18:32] <Ticho> drobilla: yeah, those scroll wheels are very cool, I have a wireless mouse with a wheel a bit like that - of course, mine is not optionally-detented, it just always spins like crazy :)
[02:18:39] <riv> the ideal for me would be: wired, 3 buttons, a very good scroll wheel
[02:18:54] <riv> i dont actually like the extra buttons, although I guess I could just remap them so they do nothing
[02:19:16] <riv> drobilla, when you say ergo, you don't mean vertical/sideways mouse?
[02:19:17] <Ticho> yeah, mine has two extra buttons on the side, but I never use them
[02:19:47] <drobilla> riv: Yeah I used various vertical ones for years (and still do sometimes).  Although I never did find out that felt juuuuuuuust right
[02:19:48] <riv> i click them by accident they change what webpage im on :/
[02:19:57] <Ticho> exactly :)
[02:20:08] <riv> drobilla, yeah I was curious what you thought about vertical - i actually don't really feel a need for it
[02:20:20] <riv> logitech m570 - that scrollball could be good :D
[02:20:21] <drobilla> Ticho: I feel like that'd drive me nuts (I usually use the detent) but I guess you'd get used to it
[02:20:39] <drobilla> riv: My shoulders and wrists are an absolute dumpster fire.  YMMV :)
[02:20:49] <riv> lol ;_;

[02:21:09] <riv> wrists moreso
[02:21:53] <Ticho> drobilla: it's actually rather useful, you learn quickly how much spin to use
[02:21:58] <drobilla> Although it has always sort of theoretically annoyed me that we treat horizontal surfaces as "neutral" because we like flat surfaces and think of them as "normal" and such, when it's very much not as far as how arms actually work...
[02:22:11] *** Joins: fro (fro@humpty.dance)
[02:22:58] <Ticho> we treat them as neutral because when you put something on them, it stays put
[02:23:21] <riv> theory is one thing!
[02:23:39] <riv> splitting my keyboard helped me enormously, but in my case vertical mouse didn't seem to matter

[02:24:23] <mulliken> Love both of them
[02:24:31] <drobilla> riv: Yeah, the keyboard (I moved to an Advantage) helped immensely.  The mouse, meh, it did a bit for me, but just a bit
[02:25:17] <drobilla> In the pursuit of more mobility/flexibility/etc I moved to Ergodoxen but I miss the dish and thought-out key placement so much
[02:25:56] <drobilla> But I'll clearly never be happy until I have a Dactyl with QMK.  It's just a lot easier to gripe about it on the internet than build one of those things :)

[03:27:43] <drobilla> My head canon is that the semantic web won, so a "quad" isn't a fixed number of bytes, but a semantic statement.  It's actually a lot of data because an individual node in a quad can be enormous
[03:30:00] <drobilla> In other words, the Federation doesn't use a "tuples all the way down" system, but rather uses RDF-like storage as the highest level of information organization.  So they use *quads as a more high-level metric, a bit like "number of files we have", not like how we currently use *bytes

[05:47:00] <quanticle> "This proposed solution would allow developers to explicitly opt-in to supporting a range of GTK themes rather than just libadwaita, satisfying concerns by a vocal minority of GNOME application developers that non-Adwaita themes negatively impact the quality of their applications, and makes it harder to perform QA."
[05:47:05] <quanticle> I don't understand that
[05:47:44] <quanticle> Why can't the Gnome developers make it clear that they won't necessarily go out of their way to make Gnome apps work with nonstandard themes?

[09:17:29] <ignaloidas> also, think what platforms exist right now
[09:18:10] <cb> what's a platform to you then?

[09:19:39] <cb> i.e. windows is a platform because you can consistently target it
[09:19:49] <cb> even if distribution side sucks
[09:19:51] <ignaloidas> GNOME developers have been acting in the same manner for a last while
[09:20:40] <ignaloidas> cb: I could say then that Wayland on linux is a platform because I can consistently target it
[09:20:54] <cb> except "wayland on linux" means nothing
[09:21:10] <ignaloidas> GNOME disagrees, because there is no defined design language or app store
[09:21:12] <cb> what libc bc that matters? what audio stack? what distro?
[09:21:46] <cb> when i make a windows app i target the platform's APIs, the binaries i make are guaranteed to run on another install of it
[09:22:04] <ignaloidas> if you distribute your source code only audio stack matters, and even then you can almost always use ALSA
[09:22:11] <cb> ofc that's more guarantees than "gnome/kde" already until they evolve further
[09:22:33] <cb> i have a dim view of bazaars being able to make platforms due to the shitshow of linux binary distribution
[09:22:49] <cb> wine is a better target

[09:26:50] <ignaloidas> cb, it could save you if we had a decent IPC in linux
[09:27:15] <ignaloidas> but since sockets and shared memory is the best we have, we can't push that through

[11:20:51] <meff[m]> imo just go into it with a simple project in mind for the sole purpose of experimenting
[11:20:59] <meff[m]> find what works for you
[11:22:25] <ignaloidas> usrme, if the data just needs to be packed together for processing you have better tools like nametuples or dataclasses
[11:23:39] <ignaloidas> I find that Python works best as a mix of object oriented and procedural code, because it's often the easiest way to map the problem
[11:25:52] <mockturtle> An Old Programmer Loses His Job [programming] (ungreen) https://lobste.rs/s/rsgkbh
[11:26:06] <ignaloidas> e.g. if you are doing operations on some quantifiable object (be it a user, a process, a concept) they should be tied together into a class, but if you have an action that cannot be really tied together to something, it's well fit to be a standalone function
[11:31:01] <usrme> what if, for example, I'm working with creating a resource group in Azure? the flow at the moment is to have a ResourceGroup class with an initializer that takes in the subscription name and the location where to group should be created in, it then sets those as properties of the object, plus it creates an additional name property that is
[11:31:02] <usrme> essentially a random value with a prefix. I then have a "create" function in that class that calls the actual commands necessary to create the resource. the calling code is pretty much "resource_group = ResourceGroup(subscription, location); resource_group.create()"
[11:31:31] <usrme> *correction: "create" is a method in the class
[11:31:58] <usrme> I thought about calling "create" directly when the object is initialized, but having such a potentially expensive operation occur every time the object is instantiated seems wasteful
[11:32:19] <usrme> then again, the entire fact that I'm using a class might be wasteful '=D
[11:33:13] <quanticle> No, that seems like a reasonable approach
[11:33:34] <quanticle> A ResourceGroup is a noun in your domain and thus it makes sense to represent it with a class
[11:35:24] <quanticle> This way you can create classes representing different Azure entities, and as long as they all define a "create" function, you can create representations of multiple different entities locally, and then call .create() on each one in turn to actually create the resource in Azure.
[11:37:52] <usrme> at which point should that be abstracted into some kind of "ResourceCreator" abstract base class that "ResourceGroup" and potentially others inherit from to conform to a stricter interface? at the moment I'm only forecasting 1 or 2 types of entities that I need to work with
[11:38:09] <meff[m]> I wouldn't yet
[11:38:59] <meff[m]> 1 or 2 types of entities is a little early imo, once more entities come along you can reconsider. There's benefits to flatter class hierarchies
[11:39:27] <ignaloidas> if you grow that need, maybe, but usually, the phrase to go by is "You ain't gonna need it"
[11:40:17] <ignaloidas> build what you need now, future-proofing without knowing the future will probably result in something that won't match the future
[11:43:04] <quanticle> In general, abstract base classes are probably not the way you want to go
[11:43:43] <quanticle> You have to be very sure of your inheritance hierarchy, because using an abstract base class will lock you into that hierarchy

[11:45:20] <quanticle> This is especially true in Python, which has duck-typing. You don't need to inherit from an abstract base class in order to satisfy a type checker that the object you're passing into a function or adding to an array is of type whatever

[18:40:43] <iDrougge> c355e3b: Is Nix useful for that case?
[18:40:46] <wink> I think the main problem of nix is becoming that all the people are becoming smug zealots

[18:41:21] <wink> the reasonable people have used it for years andf it's fine
[18:41:32] <wink> disregard my grammar today
[18:41:43] <wink> but yeah, there always have been some. but the majority was not vocal
[18:41:47] <edk> it's been like that for a good while now, though
[18:41:54] <rwb> as with everything that's touted as the panacea, it has become annoying for the people who have evaluated it and decided not to use it

[19:16:27] <shapr> iDrougge: and I firmly believe git is better than CVS
[19:16:41] <epilys> rwb, ??
[19:16:43] <shapr> though at the time, the fight was trying to convince employers that we needed version control AT ALL
[19:16:55] <ngoldbaum> cvs had fewer network effects
[19:16:59] <shapr> If you get an old copy of the pragmatic prorgammer, you'll see what the complaints of the time were
[19:16:59] <feoh> Perforce was actually pretty good in certain key areas but it evolved to a certain point and then stopped
[19:17:06] <rwb> epilys: JIRA joke
[19:17:16] <ngoldbaum> and didn’t have an extremely popular social network associated with it
[19:17:23] <feoh> Like, perforce's concept of the client was AWESOME
[19:17:27] <ngoldbaum> cvshub stars were a thing though
[19:17:52] <iDrougge> shapr: I never said CVS was good in any way. I just want something better than Git too.
[19:17:56] <feoh> you could configure it to pull random paths from anywhere you wanted in the repository and assemble them through your clientspec into a custom local workspace
[19:18:11] <ngoldbaum> without network effects an improved vcs can be 2x better and get adoption
[19:18:31] <iDrougge> I agree that it was much easier to get a new version control system when the alternative was none at all, and when there was no VersionControlSystemHub.
[19:18:35] <ngoldbaum> but with network effects you have to be clearly better along every axis and use case to get people to switch
[19:19:02] <feoh> merging was 1000% better than CVS, but  it didn't have Git's merkle tree magic and as such large branch merges were still SUUUPER painful
[19:19:06] <shapr> iDrougge: cvs was better than nothing!
[19:19:11] <feoh> It was
[19:19:14] <feoh> and better than RCS :)
[19:19:18] <shapr> true that
[19:19:23] <shapr> I only used RCS a few times, and yuck
[19:19:36] <iDrougge> shapr: But luckily, it wasn't the last word in version control.
[19:19:38] <feoh> and all of them were better than SCCS which was an abomination
[19:20:02] <shapr> team foundation server was the worst I've used
[19:20:08] <feoh> (It did something horrible around storing your deltas so you could lose critical data trivially if there was any filesystem corruption in your tree)
[19:20:18] <shapr> microsoft product that would consistently corrupt its database once a week, on a randomly chosed day
[19:20:19] <iDrougge> ngoldbaum: I think the way forward to challenge Git is to make something which works for a sufficiently large percentage of the 99 % of computer users who don't use version control at all.
[19:20:31] <feoh> I found TFS to be pretty bad, yeah.  Better than Visual SourceSafe, their prior offering, but that's not saying much
[19:20:34] <shapr> and that entire day you were without version control until the admins restored from backup and rebuilt the database
[19:20:53] <shapr> feoh: yeah, we called it sourceUNsafe
[19:21:09] <ngoldbaum> iDrougge: i think something that takes a lot of the ceremony out of version control and just does transparent backups of work as you do it would be immensely helpful for a lot of people
[19:21:21] <shapr> whatever else, I'm really happy a bunch of open source things did win over the closed source bug ridden products
[19:21:21] <ngoldbaum> not saying getting that to work in a way that people

[19:22:18] <feoh> ngoldbaum: That would be good in some ways and not in others. Can you imagine something like Git that gave you the power to constructively roll back to whatever point and control the way new versions were fed into mainline but had MUCH better UX?

[19:26:16] <JordiGH> ?
[19:26:17] <ngoldbaum> i think the main advantage of version control is being able to work without fear or losing what you already finished
[19:26:18] <feoh> JordiGH: Been struggling with that a lot lately, and I've come down on the side of separating the art from the artist. I still love Firefly whether or not Joss Wheedon is a mega-twit :) Just like I will always love Cream and most of early Clapton despite him having become an anti-vaxxer and also a twit :)
[19:26:35] <ngoldbaum> a tool that exposed that well to more people would be really transformative
[19:26:37] <edk> Ori_B: yes, but i probably don't *want* that
[19:26:44] <ngoldbaum> don’t need merges or commit messages for that…
[19:26:46] <edk> ngoldbaum: it already exists, it's time machine
[19:27:00] <Ori_B> JordiGH: yeah, I actually kind of do. scrubbing a timeline along between commits would be nice
[19:27:02] <edk> but it's not very good for collaborating with other people
[19:27:09] <Ori_B> but having labelled checkpoints is *useful*
[19:27:21] <Ori_B> branches, less so.
[19:27:30] <edk> branches are useful for collaborating, too
[19:27:31] <feoh> ngoldbaum: I think you're onto something there. People struggle to make commit messages meaningful and fail a lot, but I'm not entirely sure throwing them out is the right answer either.
[19:27:39] <JordiGH> Ori_B: You want to read *other people's* commit messages? Everyone writes utter crap unless they're a very particular kind of person or the project enforces very particular rules that most people nowadays hate.
[19:27:45] <ngoldbaum> i think the main problem
[19:27:59] <iDrougge> JordiGH: I would have liked a better way to handle conflicts than putting a marker on a file on the file server, or a way to merge edits from two authors.
[19:27:59] <ngoldbaum> people have with VCS is all the ceremony
[19:28:09] <edk> i don't find there's a lot of ceremony involved
[19:28:10] <iDrougge> MS Office and Google Docs have something to that effect, I think.
[19:28:29] <Ori_B> JordiGH: kind of - squash and rebase kind of solves that.
[19:28:44] <Ori_B> at the cost of dropping branches, which I'm fine with.
[19:28:47] <JordiGH> Ori_B: Right, a workaround for a feature most people don't want: commit messages.
[19:28:47] <edk> i make changes, i commit my changes and explain them, i send them somewhere, someone else reviews them and pushes a button
[19:28:59] <JordiGH> Ori_B: Same workaround for a feature msot people don't want: branches.
[19:29:11] <edk> i think you're extrapolating too much
[19:29:30] <edk> both of those things are very useful for teams of more than one person
[19:29:33] <Ori_B> yes.
[19:29:48] <Ori_B> commits are *communication*
[19:29:58] <rwb> JordiGH: read the commit messages on serenityOS
[19:30:02] <edk> they're also quite useful just for me personally, because i'll sometimes work on a backburner project in a branch, while switching back to the main branch to work on smaller stuff
[19:30:04] <Ori_B> the problem is that there's a mixup between communication and 'dont lose the work'
[19:30:19] <JordiGH> Also, squashing piles of commits into a single one to create one giant commit and one giant diff demonstrates another feature people don't really want: diffs. Nobody wants to read those.
[19:30:19] <edk> even if the commit messages in my backburner branch are useless to anyone but me, they help me orient myself
[19:30:20] <Ori_B> I also tend to not commit often, though.
[19:30:23] <rwb> sure, exception to the rule or whatever, but that makes commit messages worthwhile for me
[19:30:50] * ngoldbaum looks at how popular squash-the-PR-into-a-single-commit workflows are
[19:30:51] <Ori_B> JordiGH: I read those *constantly*.
[19:31:01] <JordiGH> Ori_B: You're a minority nerd.
[19:31:09] <rwb> that's pretty dismissive
[19:31:11] <JordiGH> Or do you mean you read the giant diffs? Because you lie.
[19:31:16] <feoh> Nobody wants to read diffs UNTIL you're umpteen versions down the line and something breaks and now you need to figure out what the hell happened in some not very frequently executed codepath :)
[19:31:21] <JordiGH> Nobody reads the giant diffs. You just can't.
[19:31:35] <JordiGH> Humans can't pay attention to it. We have the data from the studies.
[19:31:45] <JordiGH> 10 line diff means 10 things wrong with it.
[19:31:48] <feoh> Oh that's absolutely true
[19:31:48] <rwb> strong pinyans
[19:31:51] <Ori_B> JordiGH: yeah, I reject the giant diffs and ask people to split them.
[19:31:55] <JordiGH> 10,000 line diff: "lgtm"

[19:44:39] <feoh> ;)
[19:44:58] <gerikson> The Expanse is basically Made for TV
[19:45:16] <gerikson> I believe the author is a pseudonym for a team of writers
[19:45:19] <gerikson> or a duo
[19:45:35] <technomancy> I thought the Expanse was originally written as a TTRPG
[19:45:39] <gerikson> anyway, we do live in a golden age of SF... Firefly just missed it
[19:45:42] <Brekkjern> gerikson: It's a duo
[19:45:49] <gerikson> Brekkjern: ta
[19:45:56] <gerikson> I liked the first 3 novels ok
[19:45:57] <Brekkjern> At least one of the writers are working on the show.
[19:46:19] <ngoldbaum> technomancy: it started at a TTRPG then they were developing it as an MMO with three factions, then when that fell
[19:46:23] <gerikson> but Paul McAuley's The Quiet War is a better take on medium-future solar system
[19:46:24] <ngoldbaum> through they wrote a novel
[19:46:49] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: they’re both EPs on the show
[19:46:56] <ngoldbaum> and head writers
[19:47:02] <gerikson> my fav fat-book fantasy series started as a Gurps campaign

[22:55:40] <feoh> technomancy: I mean, I agree, but what we need is some kind of distributed standard so folks can keep their sources wherever and have them federate but we're not there yet, so you have to pick and choose which island you want to inhabit, and there are serious advantages to choosing the GIthub island.

[23:00:21] <feoh> There are some great points in that article but sourcehut isn't free
[23:00:30] *** Quits: jmw (~jmw@user/jmw) (Quit: jmw)
[23:00:42] <feoh> It just happens to be a business owned by a single person who we respect as a community because he's kick ass and has written a lot of incredibly high quality code
[23:01:08] <c355e3b> I've floated the idea of trying to get public libraries to offer source hosting a few times.
[23:01:12] <feoh> Now, it's TOTALLY fine if we want to say "Hey I want to give my money to sourcehut because he's a small business owner whose work I respect"
[23:01:26] <edk> the software is free though, just not the canonical instance of it
[23:01:29] <edk> you can self-host it
[23:01:36] <feoh> But that doesn't make the advantages Github brings to the table vanish in a puff of principle.
[23:01:46] <feoh> Right.
[23:01:56] <edk> i think the one advantage github has is that everyone's already on it
[23:02:02] <feoh> Exactly
[23:02:10] <edk> its usability is honestly pretty crap
[23:02:26] <c355e3b> Depends what you mean by usability
[23:02:30] <feoh> ^^^
[23:02:37] <c355e3b> For people who have used *anything* else is a nightmare
[23:02:38] <Brekkjern> I mean... It could be worse. It could have been BitBucket we all used :P
[23:02:48] <feoh> For sure. Nothing magical about Github
[23:02:49] <technomancy> everyone knows usability means "it works the same way I'm used to" =)

[23:03:09] <c355e3b> Also, I am regretting my life right now
[23:03:10] <creature> There's also the question of "tools" versus "services". Like, Git's pretty decentralised. You can have multiple remotes, or do it peer-to-peer if you like. But that doesn't help you with issue tracking, code reviews, wikis, CI, etc.

[23:05:07] <gerikson> riv: Youtube meme

[23:05:32] <c355e3b> riv: yes
[23:05:58] <c355e3b> If we are ever at the same bar, I have *stories* about that
[23:05:58] <technomancy> riv: it's so bad
[23:06:03] <drobilla> This also has negative consequences.  e.g. the sloppy and sometimes entirely backwards drive-by commits from some random account with only an alias that doesn't have their git author/email set up correctly, at least some of which is obvious "resume" padding
[23:06:04] <riv> lol
[23:06:15] <technomancy> like "we are incapable of making judgements based on critical thinking so let's use star count instead"
[23:07:14] <feoh> I kinda feel like many of us in tech live in a fantasy world. We inhabit our tiny bubbles and tribes and we've learned how to leverage them and make a living but then there's a big wide world outside those bubbles of people who punch clocks and work for BigCorps and write a TON of very un-glorious code most would sneer at, but it pays the bills.
[23:07:57] <drobilla> Then /you/ feel like the jerk maintainer making contributing hard because you can't merge significant-enough-to-be-copyrightable chunks of code attributed to mypornaccountlol@users.github.com or whatever.  It's awful
[23:09:04] <edk> feoh: sort of except i think they share the fantasy world
[23:09:22] <technomancy> I just found out a couple days ago that github has silently been blocking all my email so all the replies I made to issues and pull requests last week were lost

[23:12:06] <edk> why does cloud jira take multiple seconds to load issues?
[23:12:15] <drobilla> It's genuinely amazing
[23:13:03] <riv> i wonder why, even though there's enough people understanding and complaining the current problems - we are still kinda stuck with bad tools
[23:13:13] <riv> complaining about*
[23:13:32] <edk> well i think atlassian did a masterful bit of... pivoting i guess?
[23:13:55] <Brekkjern> It's cause Jira is fucking fantastic for everyone who wants loads of useless metrics.
[23:14:05] <Brekkjern> And they usually make the decisions
[23:14:13] <edk> when a lot of the current tech companies were startups and much more led by technical people, jira was an issue tracker for developers
[23:14:35] <edk> but they kind of morphed into it being a developer tracker for managers
[23:14:40] <Brekkjern> Yep
[23:14:44] <Brekkjern> And it's amazing for that
[23:14:47] <edk> and they timed it *perfectly*
[23:14:47] <Brekkjern> "amazing"
[23:15:11] <technomancy> atlassian obviously doesn't care about users unless they're the users who pay the bills
[23:15:28] <technomancy> follow the money
[23:15:38] <drobilla> s/atlassian/every corporation ever/
[23:15:43] <Brekkjern> To be fair though, the only users who matter are the ones who pay bills. You only cater to the others if that increases the chances of someone paying you.
[23:15:51] <technomancy> I must have missed the period during which jira was actually preferred by developers

[23:16:05] <technomancy> was that like ... early 2000s? it was real bad when I started using it in 2008
[23:16:14] <technomancy> drobilla: it's implied =)
[23:16:54] <Brekkjern> The goal of all commerce is to extract the most amount of value out of your customers. Not to actually produce something of value yourself.
[23:17:50] <technomancy> turns out software written by people who like to write software tends to be better than software written by people trying to get paid; who knew
[23:17:57] <feoh> edk: Isn't interesting in the eye of the beholder?
[23:18:00] <jj5> Brekkjern: I think you're being too cynical there
[23:18:20] <feoh> I find infrastructure as code FASCINATING. Most hardcore types ... Do not :)
[23:18:43] <Brekkjern> jj5: I have yet to find any reason to not be in this aspect of society :P
[23:19:47] <jj5> I recall saying something once along the lines of "it's more important that you create value than it is that you get paid" and I think I still basically believe that, which is kinda the opposite of what you said
[23:20:18] <feoh> edk: Another example - I love Python and find learning more about how to use it well fascinating. Most hardcore coders, do not :) So 'interesting' is not definable as a global metric IMO
[23:20:58] <Brekkjern> jj5: I'm saying that this is the point of commerce. You can have other personal reasons to do other things, but I'd argue that you aren't actually doing commerce at that point. You are either running a charity, or doing something for shiggles.
[23:21:51] <technomancy> recreational programming is a thing
[23:22:04] <Brekkjern> Yes. And recreational programming is not commerce.
[23:22:08] <jj5> Brekkjern: yeah I'm pretty sure I don't agree. The easiest way to make money is to actually create real value. It's harder to trick people into giving you money when you're not creating value...
[23:22:27] <technomancy> (and every good program I've written has been written recreationally)
[23:22:51] <Brekkjern> jj5: Yes, but creating value isn't the point of commerce. Creating value is incidental to extracting value from some other party.
[23:24:16] <jj5> Brekkjern: I think commerce as an institution is definitely bound up in value creation
[23:24:23] <feoh> technomancy: Exactly. I've always kinda bifurcated my involvement in tech around - this is what I do for money and THIS is what I do for love :)

[23:25:06] <drobilla> Should it not then follow that if you create value, you get money?
[23:25:26] <Brekkjern> drobilla: No. Plenty of companies that create value go bankrupt.
[23:25:34] <feoh> Value creation is only a tiny part of the "get money" process :)
[23:25:36] <feoh> Marketing
[23:25:38] <drobilla> Indeed...
[23:25:50] <jj5> drobilla: that's the theory. In practice sometimes our mechanisms and culture fail us...
[23:26:07] <drobilla> jj5: Yeah, the trouble is the theory is nonsense
[23:26:10] <Brekkjern> Some companies that create value are often bought by competitors to be run into the ground.
[23:26:16] <Brekkjern> Entirely so they cannot create value
[23:26:39] <varjag> not enough value for the two
[23:27:09] <Brekkjern> Or the larger party can extract more value if the smaller one doesn't change the playing field.
