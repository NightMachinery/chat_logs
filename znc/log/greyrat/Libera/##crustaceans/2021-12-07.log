[02:50:52] <gwozniak> I'm finally reading that "left pad" story and it seems to be fawning a bit to much over The Unix Philosophy
[02:51:00] <gwozniak> s/to much/too much/
[02:52:29] <jjuran> In the mantra "Do one thing and do it well", my understanding is that "thing" refers to an entire problem to be solved, not a single one-line function.
[02:53:13] <gwozniak> Yeah, it's something that's so open to interpretation that I don't like looking at it as a "rule"
[02:53:19] <jjuran> Not an entire application, but a discretely user-recognizable chunk of functionality.
[02:53:27] <gwozniak> But it's a good general principle to work from
[02:53:43] <gwozniak> yes. I agree with that characterization
[02:55:47] <jjuran> The problem solved by the ethos that gave us left-pad is allowing many beginner JS users to feel like they were contributing to a pool of knowledge used by others — to feel that they were valued and important.
[02:56:00] <companion_cube> How dare you
[02:56:14] <companion_cube> Packages like is-even are important!!
[02:57:12] <gwozniak> One thing I don't see in this "micro-dependencies" talk all that much is that when you do break things down a lot, you tend to have to put them together in the same way many times.  And a lot of the time the constituent parts of that aggregate are pretty much only used in that aggregate.  So now you're introducing complexity for no reason.
[02:59:41] <jjuran> It definitely isn't related to software engineering.
[02:59:55] <gwozniak> Yeah, it's a pattern all over the place
[03:01:24] <jjuran> Ego indulgence?
[03:01:25] <gwozniak> I don't know how many times I've decomposed something into smaller parts and ended up putting them all back together into a "monolith" because of a) comprehensability or b) performance

[17:18:36] <Brekkjern> Honestly, that name post is a constant pain in the ass for me...
[17:18:56] <Brekkjern> Like, a lot of the stuff in that list are things I have to deal with a lot when designing systems
[17:19:43] <edk> yeah but they're not falsehoods that programmers believe
[17:19:58] <edk> they're simplifications that society in general believes and sometimes enforces
[17:20:03] <Brekkjern> The programmers of the systems I interact with sure as hell believed it...
[17:20:35] <edk> programmers tend to solve the problem in front of them
[17:21:57] <edk> they're not going to design a system which lets you have arbitrarily many names, each with an arbitrary address, and an arbitrary short form, and an arbitrary formal form, and arbitrary rules for which order you chop off prefixes and suffixes
[17:22:20] <Brekkjern> Those are the kinds of systems I have to make...
[17:22:24] <edk> because not only have they not been asked to do that, if they did it their UX team would beg them to take it away again
[17:24:22] <Xe> The big annoying part for me is that "Xe" is my preferred name in professional contexts. "Xe" does not have a last name. "Xe" is not a replacement for my legal first name. I do not want to see my legal last name follow "Xe", that reminds me that I am related to antivax abusive libertarian fuckwads
[17:24:39] <Brekkjern> At this point I just treat a persons name as a list of aliases for that person.
[17:24:43] <Brekkjern> Much easier to deal with
[17:24:57] <edk> right but you still haven't solved all the problems here
[17:25:02] <Brekkjern> Nope
[17:25:06] <edk> and you basically never will
[17:25:10] <Brekkjern> True
[17:25:34] <Xe> also fuck you bamboohr for making more gender options than "male" and "female" pay to win
[17:25:54] <Xe> fuckwads
[17:25:55] <edk> i don't think programmers believe they're solving for every case, they just have requirements and N sprints to implement them in
[17:25:57] <edk> wait wtf
[17:26:03] <river> extra gender DLC lmao
[17:26:04] <edk> you have to pay to be non-binary?
[17:26:17] <edk> that's the most capitalism thing i've ever heard
[17:27:12] <Xe> yes, your company has to pay more per month for people to self-identify as nonbinary
[17:27:18] <edk> Xe: can you change your legal name to just Xe?
[17:27:23] <Xe> so i have been refusing to fill it out
[17:27:26] <edk> or would that just create even more problems
[17:27:46] <edm> ‘human resources’ as a phrase should tell you everything anyway
[17:27:49] <Xe> edk: idly been considering it, but so many systems at work assume a first and last name, so I need to think about that
[17:27:52] <edk> well yes
[17:27:57] <edk> Xe: Xe N/A
[17:27:59] * edk dabs
[17:28:05] <Xe> and don't allow slashes
[17:28:18] <edk> mm, that's annoying
[17:29:02] <edk> edm: it seems to also be common to just talk about "resource" when you mean "people" here
[17:29:18] <Xe> fuck that shit with a rake
[17:29:23] <Xe> i am not a resource
[17:29:39] <dimadima> "< Xe> yes, your company has to pay more per month for people to self-identify as nonbinary"
[17:29:45] <edk> if you're a willing participant in capitalist society you sort of are
[17:29:50] <edk> if you don't want to be a resource, burn something down
[17:29:51] <Brekkjern> There are industries with worse expressions for people...
[17:29:56] <Xe> dimadima: i'm not kidding
[17:30:05] <dimadima> xe://
[17:30:10] <dimadima> ^ resource
[17:30:24] <Xe> 🔪
[17:30:26] * dimadima googles bamboohr
[17:31:06] <dimadima> what's the upgrade required to get non-binary ppl working in this thing lol
[17:31:09] <dimadima> "lol" wtf
[17:31:11] <river> are there any people with emojis in there name
[17:31:44] <edk> i'm sure there are
[17:31:55] <edk> it does raise the question of what's the limit on things that can be in names though
[17:32:26] <Brekkjern> Why should there be a hard limit?
[17:32:37] <edk> practically there's a hard limit to anything
[17:32:41] <dimadima> https://www.change.org/p/change-the-gender-field-in-bamboohr-to-be-inclusive-of-all-gender-expressions
[17:32:45] <edm> i remember watching a documentary about a very grand london hotel, in which the director and his hospitality team have daily briefings and one of the jobs is to hand-write welcome cards to VIPs
[17:32:52] <edm> anyway they had ‘the edge’ from US staying
[17:32:58] <edm> and it flumoxed them
[17:33:12] <edk> like in most cases you probably can't have something in your name that doesn't have a unicode codepoint
[17:33:22] <Xe> at the least though i don't want to have to continue to bear the name of abusers, i'm disowning my parents that hard
[17:33:25] <edk> and your passport name is considerably more restricted than that
[17:33:41] <Brekkjern> I'm lucky that my name doesn't contain anything that isn't in the fucking ASCII table. Holy shit how many systems trip up on that?!
[17:33:42] <dimadima> i don't think you can have an emoji in your naem in the united states
[17:33:53] <edm> this was quite an effete but precise german manager as i recall, and he was really struggling with the address ‘dear edge… no no not like zis… dear mr edge?… no…. dear the edge… no zis does not sound right…. mr ze edge?… no’
[17:33:55] <edm> etc etc
[17:34:04] <kronk> watch them try and stop me.
[17:34:05] <edk> it's tricky to even define what that means in the UK
[17:34:26] <edk> we don't have legal names, although we obviously do have a name that's on government documents
[17:34:29] <Xe> edm: the correct salutation there is "Hello,"
[17:34:30] <edm> ‘the edge’ from U2, i meant to write, not US
[17:35:04] <kronk> is their alias 'edgelord'
[17:35:07] <river> someone with a name that's 16GB of random data
[17:35:15] <edk> but since your "real" name can be anything you use as your name, i guess it's only limited by what you can get other people to call you
[17:35:18] <kronk> because if not, holy fuck
[17:35:20] <edm> on a similar note is slash isn’t allowed, that must make gun’s n roses touring visas a nightmare
[17:35:30] <Brekkjern> edk: That is the crux of the matter really
[17:36:04] <river> edm: lol
[17:36:13] <kronk> Take cues from Prince.
[17:36:14] <Brekkjern> In systems where the user inputs the data themselves they provide an identifier that contains what they would like to be referred as when a third party contacts them
[17:36:16] <edm> what would you do as a name though
[17:36:18] <Xe> so if i do get my last name changed, i'm going to have to come up with something unique using the lower 26 characters of the latin alphabet and preferably is less than 3 syllables
[17:36:22] <edm> like an arbitrary 32 char string?
[17:36:35] <edk> Xe: what about "isthmuses"
[17:36:36] <Brekkjern> In systems where the name is added by a third party, it is usually an observation.
[17:36:45] <dimadima> elon musk had to rename his child
[17:36:49] <dimadima> i think the rules are pretty strict
[17:36:55] <Brekkjern> Xe: I hear Null is all the rage
[17:37:06] <kronk> Xe: just use "Xe" again.
[17:37:07] <Xe> edm: portugese and spanish names can be up to 300 unicode runes long
[17:37:13] <river> dimadima: oh was that recent?
[17:37:15] <edk> isthmuses is an actual english word, nobody can possibly object to that
[17:37:17] <edm> great fact
[17:37:22] <river> and what happened with him and grimes
[17:37:28] <Brekkjern> Xe: A name field being defined as 300 unicode runes is fucking amazing IMO
[17:37:29] <edm> and i suppose in many bits oif europe there are long names and titles
[17:37:52] <kronk> Xe Xe.
[17:38:02] <Xe> edk: i'd also like to have it be very homoiconic between speech and written forms
[17:38:35] <kronk> "I am Xe, so much that it says it twice."
[17:38:35] <edk> how do you pronounce "xe"?
[17:38:50] <Xe> edk: the same way americans say the letter "z"
[17:38:55] <edk> aha
[17:39:13] <dimadima> river: last few years?
[17:39:20] <Brekkjern> Why not go all "I'm So Meta Even This Acronym"?
[17:39:21] <dimadima> 2020
[17:39:26] <edk> isthmuses is pretty phonetic, it's just very difficult to pronounce
[17:39:35] <kronk> if you use Xe as your middle name, you can change your last name to Top and fuck with people.
[17:41:06] <Brekkjern> Or just go "undefined" and watch the world burn
[17:41:24] <kronk> Xe Xe Top.
[17:41:52] <kronk> I think that entitles you to sweet guitar riffs.
[17:41:56] <Xe> i wish more places just let you use a fucking mononym
[17:43:47] <kronk> b-but how will we differentiate you with all the other people with mononyms. despite the fact that name clashes are all too common even with duonyms.
[17:44:06] <kronk> Michael Bolton.
[17:44:12] <Brekkjern> Use a guid for the actual ID field?
[17:44:46] <kronk> humans can't pronounce GUIDs.
[17:45:13] <Brekkjern> I usually don't try to
[17:46:18] <Xe> if you assign each hex digit a name you can get something close to it
[17:48:08] <Xe> 0badf00d -> no fei dau jau vai no no jau
[17:48:38] <gwozniak> Still remarkably impractical
[17:49:18] <Xe> well then you can assign bytes instead of nibbles :P
[17:50:31] <gwozniak> The thing is, if someone has a name that is intentionally difficult, people will choose an easier one and go with that instead
[17:51:10] <Brekkjern> Same if it is unintentionally difficult :P
[17:51:17] <Brekkjern> Or repetitive
[17:51:26] <gerikson> edk: I believe the NYT refers to the artist Meat Loaf as "Mr. Loaf"
[17:51:40] <Brekkjern> Or if it's "Richard" you are now called "Dick"
[17:51:57] <kronk> Better than Mr. Meat.
[17:52:23] <Xe> but yeah
[17:52:30] <Xe> shit's wild
[17:53:45] <kronk> please refer to me as my quadnym, "I Hate Your Service, Jr. III"
[17:57:56] <Xe> i have no name and i must scream
[17:58:29] <gwozniak> oh fun, time for my global export compliance training
[17:58:37] <gwozniak> something to do when I get back from the dentist
[17:59:01] <kronk> "getting my teeth pulled was more fun"
[17:59:14] <gerikson> here in Sweden you just pay $20 and submit wishes for a new name, and as long as it passes a general review that is granted
[17:59:21] <gerikson> for given names
[17:59:29] <gerikson> surnames is a bit more expensive
[17:59:39] <gerikson> but each Swede has a UID anyway
[18:04:11] <Brekkjern> More or less the same here, but it doesn't mean that databases and other systems allow the name change :S
[18:07:54] <edk> gerikson: that's delightful
[18:08:17] <gerikson> Brekkjern: true dat
[18:08:26] <edk> unlike Brekkjern you can be a dual national, though
[18:08:30] <gerikson> but otoh a lot of systems here read from the Skatteverket data
[18:08:38] <Brekkjern> edk: It's allowed now in Norway too.
[18:08:41] <edk> oh!
[18:09:16] <edk> so what would happen if you became a citizen of a state with the (correct) "just do whatever lol" approach to legal names and changed your name there?
[18:09:45] <cb> i think that post needed to be call "Falsehoods programmers believe about gender"
[18:09:46] <Brekkjern> You still have a Norwegian identity which would take presedence I assume.
[18:10:22] <cb> Xe: grindset behaviour: take your husband's last name so you don't have to share a name with morons
[18:10:42] <Xe> cb: yeah i may do that
[18:13:43] <ngoldbaum> lol https://quill.chat/updates/2021-12-07-quill-twitter/
[18:13:44] <buttsbot> Twitter + Quill - Quill - Messaging for teams that focus
[18:14:02] <ngoldbaum> “we had a wonderful journey; you have 96 hours to get your data”
[18:14:23] <cb> ngoldbaum: either it's a wonderful journey, it's twitter trying to diversify to make money, or they go full zulip
[18:15:05] <ngoldbaum> i don’t think i’ve ever seen “we’re shutting down our servers in 4 days, suckers” on one of these
[18:15:24] <cb> yeah that's some real bullshit
[18:15:48] <companion_cube> better no be on vacation
[18:16:08] <gerikson> focused teams never take more than 2 days off duh
[18:46:55] <indigo> ngoldbaum: my last company got fucked by a Twitter acquisition too. We used a fraud analysis service called Smyte and they just turned their API off after they got acquired by Twitter
[18:47:22] <ngoldbaum> wow that’s fucked
[18:48:45] <indigo> Yeah it was pretty awful. Thankfully we still had our old internal anti fraud system and quickly re-integrated
[18:49:25] <companion_cube> is it in the contract, in general, that services can be interrupted like that?
[18:49:33] <companion_cube> surely when you buy a company, you inherit the contracts?
[18:49:54] <indigo> I think whoever was writing the contract fell asleep at the wheel
[18:55:05] <indigo> Also re: the previous names discussion, it was a fun time when a team added a swear word filter to names

[20:38:57] <kronk> cool, prod is down
[20:39:03] <kronk> for EVERYTHING
[20:40:02] <manicennui> I think there are AWS problems right now.
[20:40:24] <manicennui> https://status.aws.amazon.com/
[20:40:26] <buttsbot> AWS Service Health Dashboard - Dec 7, 2021 PST
[20:45:00] <Xe> “Multiple network devices impaired in us-east-1, no ETA to recovery” says AWS
[20:47:59] <jlindgren> so thats why jira is slow, thanks aws
[21:04:35] <indigo> Gotta do that multi cloud now
[21:05:50] <imode> prooood is doooown~
[21:06:01] <manicennui> Hmm. One of my coworkers is wearing fingerless gloves. I wonder how much that helps when one's fingers get cold.
[21:06:09] <imode> (fyi kronk is my alter-ego on mobile.)
[21:06:27] <manicennui> indigo: You just have to spend more money on AWS to distribute everything across 15 zones.
[21:06:48] <manicennui> When your expenses are equal to your revenue, you will have complete reliability.
[21:13:33] <jlindgren> imode: pull the lever!
[21:13:57] <Brekkjern> Since AWS is down, did he pull the wrong lever?
[21:14:10] <jlindgren> i choose to believe so
[21:15:07] <indigo> imode: Can you fix AWS please
[21:15:12] <indigo> Or as Bezos likes to say
[21:15:14] <indigo> ?
[21:15:47] <imode> I'm thankful I didn't pull the wrong lever.
[21:15:49] <manicennui> He doesn't care as long as you all continue to push his services for him.
[21:16:00] <imode> also we're working on it.
[21:16:11] <Brekkjern> Who'd have thunk? :P
[21:25:22] <indigo> TIL work has a policy where you can't patch WTFPL code
[21:25:26] <indigo> Sorry Brekkjern
[21:25:42] <Brekkjern> lol
[21:26:37] <Brekkjern> If anyone relies on buttsbot for any sort of service, then I pity them :P
[21:27:17] <Brekkjern> I honestly don't have the faintest idea if the license is compatible with any of the dependencies, but since I don't distribute builds I think I'm good?
[21:27:24] <Brekkjern> Eh... Legal shit... Who cares :P
[21:29:49] <indigo> I think we can't even patch it on our own time with that license
[21:31:17] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:33:27] <manicennui> I would like a refund for buttsbot downtime
[21:36:07] <imode> someone is actually arguing that adding validation violates hyrum's law.
[21:36:22] <imode> has someone invented punch-to-the-jaw-over-IP yet.
[21:37:19] <indigo> v.v.v
[21:37:19] <buttsbot> ༼ つ ✿◕‿◕✿༽つ (‿ˠ‿)
[21:37:36] <indigo> TIL Hyrum's law
[21:39:51] <manicennui> Appealing to authority is so weak.
[21:40:15] <dimadima> kinda makes sense
[21:40:27] <manicennui> Hyrum's law appears to be more of a description of what tends to happen, not some set of rules that one must not violate.
[21:40:30] <dimadima> big system at amazon, touching anything will change something for somebody
[21:41:13] <manicennui> Hot take: the rate of change of most software today is a huge, huge downside almost always
[21:41:26] <dimadima> that was a top HN post yesterday
[21:41:42] <dimadima> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29457930
[21:41:43] <buttsbot> Ask HN: Why is everything changing too fast? | Hacker News
[21:41:44] <manicennui> But you can't have super stable software that doesn't change because geeks will claim that it is dead
[21:41:59] <dimadima> naaa
[21:42:03] <manicennui> And idiots will try to find something else that is rapidly changing
[21:42:03] <dimadima> how stable are we talking
[21:42:07] <dimadima> geeks love stable software
[21:42:12] <manicennui> No they don't.
[21:42:15] <manicennui> They claim they do.
[21:42:19] <manicennui> But their actions show otherwise.
[21:42:28] <dimadima> hmm
[21:42:32] <dimadima> do you love stable software
[21:43:13] <manicennui> All of the things that geeks claim that they want: maintainability, understandability, stability, scalability, etc. are just nebulous terms they use to describe how closely something matches their preferences.
[21:43:35] <manicennui> If you ask 50 geeks whether some piece of software is any of those things, you'll get 50 different answers.
[21:43:46] <manicennui> We are not doing engineering.
[21:43:54] <dimadima> that's for sure
[21:44:01] <Brekkjern> I think it's more that reality is messy, so it would be nice if the starting off point is neat and tidy before you fuck it all up by shoving your cock into it.
[21:44:21] <manicennui> Brekkjern: You won't get people to even agree on whether something is "neat and tidy".
[21:44:38] <manicennui> It's just bickering over preferences.
[21:44:42] <Brekkjern> Of course
[21:44:48] <dimadima> i dunnnno
[21:45:10] <companion_cube> manicennui: this post seems to lament SaaS
[21:45:15] <companion_cube> not just software in general
[21:45:22] <companion_cube> only saas changes under your feet without notice
[21:45:27] <manicennui> companion_cube: I didn't read that post.
[21:45:36] <companion_cube> the HN comment, anyway
[21:45:36] <manicennui> And wasn't responding to it.
[21:46:23] <manicennui> I don't expect most of the commentary to be intelligent.
[21:46:35] <dimadima> the one i posted?
[21:46:39] <manicennui> On a site where most people confuse change with progress.
[21:46:43] <manicennui> dimadima: Yes.
[21:46:43] <dimadima> i didn't see anything interesting in there
[21:46:51] <dimadima> just ppl complaining
[21:47:18] <manicennui> I mean, I'm a fan of complaining, obviously.
[21:47:19] <dimadima> :))
[21:47:43] <dimadima> as long as it doesn't cross too far into faux-outrage territory
[21:47:49] <manicennui> "not a software dev (thank god)"
[21:47:54] <manicennui> I'm kind of interested in that.
[21:48:04] <dimadima> meh
[21:48:23] <dimadima> is stuff even changing that fast?
[21:48:26] <manicennui> Wonder why he wrote that.
[21:48:26] <dimadima> was stuff ever good?
[21:48:29] <manicennui> dimadima: Yes.
[21:48:31] <manicennui> No.
[21:48:39] <dimadima> i would say no to both of those
[21:48:46] <manicennui> Constant change is not the key to making it good.
[21:48:54] <manicennui> Not saying there should be no change.
[21:48:57] <dimadima> i wouldn't say that either
[21:49:05] <dimadima> how can you stop change
[21:49:08] <dimadima> or why would you want to
[21:49:14] <dimadima> people are just going to do stuff
[21:49:46] <manicennui> I can't remember the last time anything changed in GitHub that made it better for me. I've been using it for about 7 years at work, and it really just seems like they move shit around and never fix fundamental problems.
[21:49:52] <indigo> Stop change by marking the git repo read only
[21:49:58] <manicennui> dimadima: I'm not sure that you can as a business.
[21:50:05] <manicennui> People expect it.
[21:50:16] <manicennui> Even when they hate a lot of the changes, and hate the breakage.
[21:50:20] <manicennui> They still want lots of change.
[21:50:39] <manicennui> Like do most of us want desktop OSes to do more?
[21:50:54] <manicennui> Or do we just want the fundamentals to be rock solid, and for most things to be add ons?
[21:51:16] <manicennui> But Apple and MS have to constantly change the look and feel, add new APIs that do the same thing, etc.
[21:51:30] <manicennui> Add features that could just be separate apps.
[21:51:59] <manicennui> Does anyone believe that Windows 11 solved any actual problems with Windows?
[21:53:25] <manicennui> I think the examples in this submission are pretty good.
[21:53:37] <manicennui> The rate of change is definitely a problem for documentation.
[21:54:22] <manicennui> And I haven't used Trello in a long time, but if Atlassian is adding a bunch of functionality to it, then it kind of becomes pointless. The entire point was the small number of features.
[21:54:56] <manicennui> Companies retiring plans and products is also a big problem.
[21:55:27] <manicennui> Wasn't someone here complaining about Twitter buying some company and retiring their product?
[21:57:40] <imode> quil.
[21:57:41] <imode> iirc.

[22:01:28] <dimadima> manicennui: why do you think change is happening fast
[22:01:40] <manicennui> dimadima: Because it is expected
[22:02:00] <manicennui> We've also moved from spending far too much time up front to spending no time
[22:02:09] <dimadima> i mean why does it feel fast to you?
[22:04:32] <manicennui> I don't know how to answer that. I see the things I use, work on, or am aware of changing rapidly.
[22:04:44] <manicennui> And most people seem to see this as a good thing.
[22:06:01] <manicennui> I'm not sure how you'd argue that things aren't changing rapidly.
[22:06:07] <manicennui> In tech.
[22:08:55] <imode> growth has been cancer-like for too long.
[22:09:14] <manicennui> An interesting case is Clojure, which has the opposite philosophy, and purposely tries to change very slowly.
[22:09:32] <manicennui> But it is reliant upon other ecosystems which change rapidly.
[22:10:05] <manicennui> So a Clojure library which is perfectly adequate and reliable suddenly stops working because the things upon which it relies changed.
[22:10:25] <manicennui> Not generally a problem with the core language/library, but is a problem with third-party libraries.
[22:11:12] <manicennui> "I feel as if the excellent wrenches I have been using for 20+ years are growing tumors in the form of a can opener. All to please people who never used a wrench or a can opener before. And production of the original wrenches is cancelled. Over night."

[22:16:21] <dimadima> how would you describe the sensation of "rapidly" (in "changing rapidly"
[22:16:31] <manicennui> Due.
[22:16:34] <manicennui> Dude.
[22:16:42] <manicennui> Are you trolling me?
[22:16:45] <dimadima> no lol
[22:16:47] *** Quits: n3t (n3t@user/n3t) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:16:58] <manicennui> Is this a software therapy session?
[22:17:03] <imode> dimadima never trolls anybody, he's genuinely curious.
[22:17:03] <dimadima> i mean, is it like you can't get a hold on it?
[22:17:22] <dimadima> cause i really honestly don't think like stuff is changing too rapidly
[22:17:23] <manicennui> Can't? No.
[22:17:25] <manicennui> Refuse to.
[22:17:36] <dimadima> cause what you've got is good enough?
[22:17:51] <manicennui> Because I'm not going to spend every waking minute keeping up with it.
[22:18:07] <dimadima> and then i wonder what it would look like if stuff hadn't been changing at its current pace
[22:18:22] <manicennui> I know what I need to know to be effective and am generally aware of important changes in things that matter.
[22:18:27] <dimadima> like would we still be programming win32? would win32 have happened?
[22:18:34] <dimadima> wordperfect was a _great_ word processor
[22:18:49] <dimadima> i don't think word processing technology has improved in 30 years
[22:18:56] <dimadima> has it?
[22:19:00] <manicennui> I'd argue that 90% of the changes to Word in the last 20 years have been complete garbage.
[22:19:20] <dimadima> i think wordperfect -> word was not an improvement
[22:19:27] <dimadima> and it's always just stayed that way
[22:19:34] <manicennui> And most people spend far more time on tweaking formatting than the actual content, which in most cases doesn't need to exist.
[22:19:42] <dimadima> that was monopoly destroying choice and making things worse for people
[22:20:18] <indigo> manicennui: I thought every day is a software therapy session here ;-)
[22:20:28] <imode> yeah why the fuck else are we here. :P
[22:20:30] <dimadima> but word processors aside all the technology that's changed has, if anything, been too slow
[22:20:40] *** Joins: n3t (n3t@s45.mydevil.net)
[22:20:41] <dimadima> like companies try to milk every stage of the evolution for all its worth
[22:20:57] <manicennui> indigo: There usually isn't a therapist asking me how I feel about the things I write though. =P
[22:20:57] <dimadima> like that entire of writeable CD media could have been 1/3 as long
[22:21:17] <dimadima> entire era*
[22:21:25] <dimadima> CD/DVD/BD etc
[22:23:35] <indigo> manicennui: Show me where the software hurt you
[22:23:39] <dimadima> like you couldn't watch youtube on an amiga you know
[22:23:48] <dimadima> everyone likes 4k
[22:24:00] <dimadima> software is loving and tender
[22:24:09] <manicennui> dimadima: I'm not convinced that higher resolution adds to most works.
[22:24:14] <manicennui> And I will die on that hill.
[22:25:11] <dimadima> i agree but sometimes it's better
[22:25:36] <dimadima> anyway there seems to be a huge demand for it
[22:25:44] <manicennui> I actually liked DVDs a lot.
[22:25:47] <dimadima> is that part of what you're saying about people just wanting it
[22:25:52] <dimadima> ugh DVDs sucked
[22:25:55] <dimadima> the menus and shit
[22:25:59] <dimadima> stressed me out always
[22:26:22] <manicennui> If you hate DVD menus, you should check out blu ray menus, which are an order of magnitude worse.
[22:26:26] <dimadima> you put it in, some shit starts looping, you gotta figure out how to play the movie
[22:26:32] <manicennui> Unskippable content, dead web content, etc.
[22:26:36] <dimadima> lol what
[22:26:49] <dimadima> i've never played a BD
[22:27:03] <manicennui> Yeah, they added some really shitty features to please studios.
[22:27:06] <dimadima> nor have seen one played, for that matter, outside of a best buy or costco
[22:27:27] <dimadima> dead web content
[22:27:34] <dimadima> is nice
[22:27:54] <manicennui> Yeah, blu rays can link to Internet content, and it is often dead after a while.
[22:28:04] <manicennui> Instead of, you know, just including the shit on the disc.
[22:28:12] <dimadima> i'm surprised the BD doesn't self describe after a while
[22:28:19] <dimadima> with some sort of license agreement
[22:28:26] <manicennui> Also more common to just not include any special content, because why give the customer something good?
[22:28:32] <dimadima> they'd do that today and it would fly
[22:29:15] <manicennui> There are a bunch of blu ray releases which are somehow worse than the DVD releases other than picture quality.
[22:29:30] <manicennui> And picture quality is not always better.
[22:29:59] <manicennui> Or sometimes they'll somehow fuck up the sound or something.
[22:30:09] <manicennui> Studios just don't give a shit about their content at all.
[22:30:12] <manicennui> JUST CONSUME!
[22:30:28] <manicennui> You have to wait until another company licenses and releases it.
[22:30:42] <manicennui> Like Criterion.

[22:33:02] <buttsbot> IMHO the answer is the tech version of bullshit jobs. You know the concept - job... | Hacker News
[22:33:55] <indigo> I don't really understand the obsession with growth of the engineering org
[22:34:01] <indigo> Eg. adding more and more people onto the team
[22:34:24] <manicennui> indigo: I think if you take VC you basically have to grow your team.
[22:34:41] <manicennui> So you can do lots of things.
[22:34:47] <indigo> Ahh... bummer
[22:34:50] <manicennui> Never mind whether those things are important or necessary.
[22:35:05] <indigo> I think folks underestimate how difficult things become when you keep adding more and more people
[22:35:21] <manicennui> Yeah. I tried to convince my boss that my team should be like 3 people.
[22:35:28] <manicennui> And that more people meant we get less done.
[22:35:39] <manicennui> Because I end up spending my time helping the others get stuff done.
[22:35:46] <manicennui> But they are way less productive than I could be.
[22:36:04] <manicennui> Not that I would actually work hard.
[22:40:27] <manicennui> There is a hawk sitting in a tree outside my window eating a bird.

[22:40:41] <dimadima> have seen that a few times
[22:42:03] <dimadima> go hawks!

[22:53:34] <manicennui> dimadima: There are about 20 people on the engineering team for the product I work on (we rely on work from another dozen engineers maybe).
[22:54:05] <manicennui> We spend most of our team trying to figure out where to make changes and testing them.
[22:54:11] <gwozniak> Slightly concerned when a team writing bootrom code isn't sure how the program counter works
[22:54:34] <gwozniak> But hey, I guess I look good for helping out...?
[22:54:41] <manicennui> s/our team/our time/
[22:55:07] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: Don't need to know how that works, do you? :P
[22:55:08] <manicennui> gwozniak: Just give up on having expectations for others in the workplace.
[22:55:32] <manicennui> I always ask myself two key questions.
[22:55:45] <manicennui> How will this affect my mental health, and how will this affect my compensation?
[22:55:47] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: if you're writing assembler you should :)
[22:56:21] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: That's why I don't write assembler :P
[22:57:20] <gwozniak> In this particular case, the person was writing offsets to data manually.  Unsurprisingly, they were wrong
[22:57:27] <manicennui> Got some DMs from a coworker earlier: "are you serious" "<name> got promoted" "there is no god"
[22:57:37] <Geekingfrog> :D
[22:58:25] <manicennui> I agree with him that <name> is useless, but I'm not going to get involved as long as that person isn't on my team.
[23:00:42] <manicennui> Hawk is just standing on the carcass now. I think he is getting full.
[23:01:54] <gwozniak> There is a hawk that circles around near my building. Have not seen it dive yet
[23:02:05] <dimadima> good hawk
[23:02:06] <gwozniak> Crows are often bothering it
[23:02:16] <dimadima> poor bird
[23:02:30] <manicennui> Crows are super interesting.
[23:03:07] <manicennui> There was a video on reddit yesterday of some magpies trying to get a hawk to let a bird go. Then a crow showed up and totally fucked with the hawk.
[23:03:17] <manicennui> Apparently they did get the hawk to let the bird go.

[23:12:14] <manicennui> Now there is a squirrel running around in the tree and the hawk is watching it.
[23:12:21] <manicennui> Not sure why the squirrel is being so brave.
[23:12:26] <manicennui> Does it know that the hawk just ate?
[23:15:46] <manicennui> Are hawks effective at hunting from 10 feet away sitting on a branch?
[23:35:06] <manicennui> dimadima: Google Maps is a good example of something that was nearly perfect over a decade ago, and now they keep making it worse.
[23:36:11] <manicennui> Street View and public transportation information and navigation are good features.
[23:38:58] <indigo> But don’t you want to hear how you can turn left after Burger King?
[23:39:49] <indigo> This is why I use Apple Maps, since they are around the same era as Google Maps five years ago

[23:48:57] <imode> man everything is fucking broken.

[23:52:54] <Brekkjern> Cloud broken? Time to start fog computing
[23:53:09] <Geekingfrog> does it scale ?
[23:53:17] <manicennui> Need to go the other way: space computing.

[23:54:49] <buttsbot> Future Shock - Wikipedia
[23:55:00] <manicennui> The shortest definition for the term in the book is a personal perception of "too much change in too short a period of time".
