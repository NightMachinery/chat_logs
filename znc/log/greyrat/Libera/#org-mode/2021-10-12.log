[00:20:11] <Demosthenex> that looked very devopsy
[00:23:02] <Demosthenex> but gotta say, literate programming is a great way to document someething like configurations
[00:25:40] <belzurix> yeah, it's devops
[00:26:19] <belzurix> I used it necause literate programming makes it easy for me to add lots of text and comments
[00:26:45] <belzurix> and promotes a better attitude toward documenting stuff
[00:27:00] <belzurix> the scripts i rewrote were 200 lines of uncommented bash

[00:30:56] <pjb> Amongst other problems with literate programming, I find that printing out the code in a book format gives quite inconvenient constraints on code formatting.
[00:31:58] <belzurix> Sure. It also introduces hard dilemmas, like "should I use a function for this, or a parametrized code block?"

[00:50:53] <Demosthenex> just remember children. to err is human, to crash is of computer, but to really fuck up requires devops.
[00:51:00] <Demosthenex> just ask facebook
[00:52:01] <belzurix> dunno what's devops tbh, at this point it's a weasel word
[00:52:29] <Demosthenex> it means any sufficiently advanced scripting technology to deploy and update stuff, without using change control
[00:52:47] <Demosthenex> that's it's origin, "we don't want to deal with change control"
[00:52:57] <Demosthenex> which is where the adults in the room told them no, you can't push to production
[00:53:46] <Demosthenex> i fully support operations management at scale, with federation for safety
[00:53:56] <belzurix> I feel totally dumb now
[00:54:05] <belzurix> what's "change control"?
[00:54:24] <belzurix> methods to determine what should get into "next version"?

[00:54:44] <Demosthenex> often it's a weekly meeting where IT people meet with IT management and biz management to inform them of upcoming changes that could impact the environment
[00:54:57] <belzurix> thank god we have those
[00:54:59] <Demosthenex> sometimes that even needs approval
[00:55:27] <belzurix> pushing to production is a long process
[00:55:42] <Demosthenex> fact, every biz could be seen as an entity implementing an algorithm
[00:55:49] <Demosthenex> its just a large function
[00:56:06] <Demosthenex> they have risk management for lawsuits, HR, internal biz processes, etc.
[00:56:11] <belzurix> definitely impure function, and has a huge array of inputs, too
[00:56:17] <Demosthenex> IT should also have risk management, it's called change control meetings.
[00:56:49] <Demosthenex> because risk management is essential for making sure that you don't corrupt or crash a large impure function with side effects and a huge array of inputs ;]
[00:57:13] <belzurix> I see. Client is government, so mistakes can be devastating
[00:57:22] <Demosthenex> there are companies that have gone out of biz from IT failures. it's a real risk
[00:57:31] <Demosthenex> just ask AT&T Wireless.
[00:58:43] <belzurix> Well yeah. We shouldn't forget that our actions have consequences
[00:59:12] <Demosthenex> cingular bought them for pennies on the dollar after their internal system upgrade died trying to implement universal 10 digit calling and number portability. no backups, no rollback plan. within the month they were bought
[00:59:48] <Demosthenex> imagine being unable to manage your customer base for a month as a large cellular carrier.
[00:59:49] <belzurix> :O
[01:00:02] <Demosthenex> crash and burn
[01:00:21] <belzurix> > no backups, no rollback plan
[01:00:28] <belzurix> i like to live dangerously, too
[01:00:53] <Demosthenex> and frankly, i think poorly of 99% of the web and related tech, because of how they pushed netscape's "ship it now, fix it later" mentality. there's no risk in losing biz when you can't post a like for a cat picture
[01:01:20] <Demosthenex> and that's before abominations like javascript
[01:02:40] <belzurix> i think the antagonist movement is called "go slow and fix things"
[01:03:06] <belzurix> I call what you describe "move fast and break penis"
[01:03:19] <Demosthenex> geez
[01:03:38] <Demosthenex> anyway, i have MSPs for customers and some of them keep wanting to implement ansible or puppet
[01:03:41] <Demosthenex> i'm all for it
[01:03:59] <Demosthenex> but.... each customer should have it's own instance, and the MSP infrastructure is on another separate one
[01:04:18] <Demosthenex> and maybe even one per site, if that's a concern
[01:05:11] <greyrat> demosthenex What's the advantage of these over a simple shell script?
[01:06:15] <belzurix> i think ansible's strength is that it's a declarative language ( which some people abuse into being a worse bash )
[01:06:39] *** Joins: raamdev (~raamdev@98.11.137.39)
[01:09:43] <Demosthenex> greyrat: so, many systems don't support scripted interfaces to change settings (ie: linux)
[01:09:58] <Demosthenex> these tools often have methods to change settings more reliably than editing a text file
[01:10:16] <Demosthenex> also, they tend to include the network layer, so that a system will call home to a controller and receive instructions
[01:10:37] <greyrat> demosthenex Can't these more reliable methods themselves be isolated to a CLI?
[01:10:40] <belzurix> is guix supposed to alleviate this problem as well?
[01:11:15] <greyrat> Calling home is also possible with shell scripts; sh -c "$(curl ...)"
[01:11:43] <Demosthenex> greyrat: sh|curl is bad. bad. bad. never . bad. no.
[01:11:51] <belzurix> beware the turing tarpit...
[01:12:09] <greyrat> Yeah, I don't see how ansible etc would be better. 
[01:12:18] <Demosthenex> so, ansible and such often break things down to awk and sed underneath, but may have a way to confirm the new hosts file, or new apache.conf is valid afterward
[01:12:27] <Demosthenex> there are some config libs out there to help with that outside of ansible
[01:12:40] <Demosthenex> well, puppet for instance. i prefer puppet over ansible
[01:12:43] <belzurix> that's quite neat to be honest
[01:12:51] <Demosthenex> it's more functional (programming wise)
[01:13:07] <Demosthenex> instead of saying "do X, then do Y, then do Z" like salt, ansible, chef, cfengine, etec
[01:13:20] <Demosthenex> puppet says "i expect you to have X configured, Y setup, and Z done"
[01:13:29] <Demosthenex> and puppet only makes the changes needed to conform to that descriptoin
[01:13:33] <Demosthenex> like haskell or prolog

[01:13:49] <belzurix> heh nice
[01:13:57] <Demosthenex> and then puppet's got good authentication (ssl) back to a main server, with VC integration
[01:14:11] <greyrat> VC?
[01:14:12] <Demosthenex> so a machine can call home and request a part of it's update
[01:14:14] <Demosthenex> git
[01:14:27] <Demosthenex> puppet also servers the files securely.
[01:14:30] <greyrat> How is this any better than `git pull`?
[01:14:43] <Demosthenex> instead of going a http pull to the internet, you can let puppet distribute a local master copy
[01:14:52] <Demosthenex> greyrat: you can't git pull /etc
[01:15:07] <greyrat> Why not?
[01:15:14] <Demosthenex> also, if you have git pull ; make update, you still need to know that the commit to git was authorized
[01:15:17] <Demosthenex> ie: code signing
[01:15:23] <umaxtu> maybe I missed this part of the discussion, but why do you prefer puppet over ansible?
[01:15:29] <Demosthenex> you start adding layers, and you'll reimplement
[01:15:42] <Demosthenex> and puppet only makes the changes needed to conform to that description
[01:15:51] <Demosthenex> it describes the finished system
[01:15:54] <Demosthenex> not the steps to get there
[01:16:23] <greyrat> I think all of these functions can be composable, unixy, small programs. Making them one big DSL just feeks wrong.
[01:16:29] <Demosthenex> now... i used to run puppet locally on a standalone machine,and i found that puppet was really heavy cpu wise.
[01:16:43] <Demosthenex> so, new distros like guix are doing exactly that
[01:17:05] <Demosthenex> there's a scheme DSL which tells the system how to configure itself, and it's native to the package manager
[01:17:34] <Demosthenex> given how running puppet from cron was so fat, i've been tempted ot try guix.
[01:17:34] <belzurix> at least I wasn't really wrong aout guix then
[01:17:40] <Demosthenex> yeah, it looks slick
[01:17:56] <Demosthenex> i'm a tech minimalist. i run gentoo and i only have what i need installed
[01:18:03] <Demosthenex> guix would support that easily
[01:18:09] <Demosthenex> and centralize my setup
[01:18:19] <Demosthenex> but, their hardline on nonfree software has been a problem for me
[01:18:35] <Demosthenex> i'm a bit more practical
[01:19:19] <Demosthenex> like, though i use gentoo and minimal software, i keep around a windoze VM to run customer's vpn clients, citrix, teams, and other spyware inside of.
[01:19:21] <belzurix> I'd tell my boss to try it out some time, but frankly, we are updating ubuntus from 2012 rn, and production runs on centos 7 
[01:19:35] <Demosthenex> belzurix: you should run redhat in production, and pay for support.
[01:19:39] <belzurix> stuff needs to be hyper stable I think
[01:19:39] <Demosthenex> not that i'm a redhat advocate
[01:19:50] <Demosthenex> HA. you just said you run linux in production and you need stability :P
[01:20:11] <Demosthenex> if you run ubuntu in prod, pay ubuntu for support

[01:20:13] <belzurix> Demosthenex: i think it's red hat, honestly it's not us who run that, it's the client.
[01:20:48] <Demosthenex> people deserve to be paid for their contributions to software, and i think providing support is a valid biz model for OSS
[01:20:56] <Demosthenex> so it's important to pay if you're a biz
[01:21:02] <Demosthenex> so less individuals must pay
[01:21:05] <belzurix> the company develops, runs test servers, and we monitor ( dunno if we monitor production servers )
[01:21:59] <belzurix> I'm not sure whether it's RHEL or centos, but our govt is probably not running RHEL
[01:22:09] <belzurix> because they spare every little coin
[01:22:11] <Demosthenex> well centos is the free knockoff
[01:22:17] <Demosthenex> fine for dev, pay for prod.
[01:22:32] <belzurix> true
[01:22:35] <Demosthenex> i wish we could find a biz model for OSS
[01:22:54] <belzurix> Sadly, we have no control over the prod systems as far as I know
[01:22:58] <Demosthenex> like, individual devs, if you publish your code, and you have X thousand users, the EU would pay Y/mo for your living
[01:23:10] <Demosthenex> to continue to support it
[01:23:21] <belzurix> Demosthenex: beware lest you get called a 4red
[01:23:38] <Demosthenex> then maybe things like gnupg, openssl, etc would get dedicated people to support them while running google and facebook for free
[01:23:55] <Demosthenex> belzurix: i'm a self employed IT consultant. i'm also anti big biz and very socialist.
[01:24:18] <Demosthenex> if i could find a better computer than what IBM makes, i'd change in a heartbeat.
[01:24:36] <belzurix> Demosthenex: no like i'm much different tbh. I just find it hard to advertise this mode of production
[01:24:50] <belzurix> Demosthenex: people 100% ignore me when I say this
[01:25:08] <Demosthenex> thing is, i'm talking about living expenses for a person, who's technically working for free today.
[01:25:18] <Demosthenex> not handouts like welfare (though those have their place)

[01:28:28] <belzurix> frankly this only works for user-facing software
[01:28:32] <Demosthenex> yep

[10:46:15] <madnificent> Anyone else having issues with org-gcal-sync throwing 400 status codes when trying to refresh the token?
[10:48:47] <jtgd> I think maybe. How long has this been happening?
[10:51:19] <madnificent> Perhaps a month or two now.  I have limited sense of time.
[10:52:26] <jtgd> I have been noticing a problem for about that long. When I startup the CalFW calendar it seems to hang.  I do C-g and it breaks out of it, but the calendar correctly shows the google entrie
[10:55:38] <madnificent> That looks like a nice package
[10:55:38] <jtgd> how did you determine that you were getting a 400? I can try to look for that.
[10:56:32] <jtgd> I like CalFW. I canhave Google, local of my own, and Sonarr all mixed in
[10:56:41] <madnificent> It shows in the *Messages* buffer.  I can check the error message there which shows the human 401 error as "Request had invalid authentication credentials. Expected OAuth 2 access token, login cookie or other valid authentication credential. See https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project."
[10:57:20] <madnificent> I see the access token being passed as a query param so perhaps that's not supported anymore...
[10:57:49] <jtgd> how do you see that?
[10:58:24] <jtgd> I guess you mean in the URL too google, but I don't know where to look for that.
[10:58:33] <madnificent> request-default-error-callback shows the URL that was called.  I can visit that url and the response payload shows me that error.  I'd include the effective URL here, but it contains an access token.
[10:58:57] <jtgd> i get it.
[10:59:27] <jtgd> that var is set after it tries to sync, and is then overwritten?
[10:59:50] <madnificent> It has the shape https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/MY_EMAIL/events?access_token=A_TOKEN&singleEvents=True&timeMin=2021-09-12T08%3A27%3A45%2B0100&timeMax=2021-12-11T08%3A27%3A45%2B0100
[11:01:09] <madnificent> What if the access credentials don't match the current key?  I can clear the access tokens but not the whole account.  I know it failed earlier and it worked again when clearing and upgrading org-gcal-sync and shifting to straight.
[11:02:56] <madnificent> Later it started failing again.  Perhaps I'm not hunting in the right forest.
[11:03:59] <jtgd> dunno. I'd sure like to fix it though.
[11:09:54] <madnificent> Calling org-gcal-request-token manually fixed it for me
[11:15:10] <jtgd> awesome, thanks. I'll try that
[11:16:35] <madnificent> This could help me a lot when planning meetings.  Can you show multiple calendars in this view?
[11:27:35] *** Quits: kickingvegas (~cchoi@c-24-5-40-20.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: leaving)
[11:31:14] <jtgd> hmm, not sure offhand, but I'm sure that's a way to contrive it, given some elisp.
[11:35:16] <madnificent> Would probably require changing org-gcal-sync then, I suspect.  Bummer.
