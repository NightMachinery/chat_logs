[00:13:43] <entuland> well, in your case you don't have a video in your markup, you have an iframe, drew

[03:01:41] <doc|work> I've been playing around with this trying to get a full width header and footer, but centred main area. https://codepen.io/Codpenio/pen/RwVNvOW When I add header { width: 100vw; }  everything goes full width. Anyone know what I can do to get what I want?

[03:08:04] *** Joins: ______GOD______ (~GOD@user/god/x-9778998)
[03:08:07] <entuland> you could simply organize your areas so that you get leeway on the sides
[03:08:14] <entuland> you want three columns at least
[03:08:46] <entuland> so that you could do "header header header", "leeway main leeway", "footer footer footer"
[03:08:59] <entuland> then you'd have to split internally the main section to arrange for the left-nav
[03:09:07] <entuland> or you make your grid 4 columns
[03:10:04] <entuland> beware not to grow uncontrolled on the header anyways, as there are insane viewports out there (4000px+ width)
[03:10:16] <doc|work> entuland, yeah, I thought about the leeway idea but how do you do that without extra markup?
[03:10:25] <entuland> I explained it above
[03:10:31] <entuland> just make your grid 3 or 4 columns
[03:10:41] <entuland> and change the way you define the areas
[03:10:43] <entuland> it's all CSS
[03:11:15] <entuland> if you move your code to jsfiddle I could edit it and save it, can't save on codepen without registering
[03:11:21] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@181.163.41.56)
[03:11:59] <entuland> it's probably good not to let your content grow beyond 1200px or 1600px or the alike, and just leave blank to the sides or some decoration
[03:12:43] *** Joins: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org)
[03:12:57] <doc|work> I'd tried the 4 column approach already and it got all ballsed up https://codepen.io/Codpenio/pen/RwVNvOW
[03:13:11] <entuland> sorry, as above, can't edit and save on codepen
[03:13:22] <doc|work> sure, which is why I did it

[03:18:17] <doc|work> there's no leeway marked area, so I thought it might be that when I was working on it earlier, hence my extra markup point
[03:19:19] <doc|work> firefox showing it the same
[03:19:54] <entuland> no, you don't have to use all the areas and that wouldn't make the declaration invalid anyways
[03:23:18] <entuland> makes no sense, I can't understand why it's not working
[03:23:24] <doc|work> ok, not just me then!
[03:25:29] <hassoon> A row is created for every separate string listed, and a column is created for each cell in the string. Multiple named cell tokens within and between rows create a single named grid area that spans the corresponding grid cells. Unless those cells form a rectangle, the declaration is invalid.

[03:29:28] <entuland> I found the issue
[03:29:29] <doc|work> hehehe
[03:29:48] <doc|work> what is it?
[03:30:11] <entuland> you can't split an area like that
[03:30:17] <doc|work> I... what?
[03:30:19] <entuland> leeway is in two different spots
[03:30:21] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/4q2hdc81/
[03:30:22] <doc|work> isn't that the point?
[03:30:30] <entuland> you need leewayleft and leewayright or something
[03:30:43] <doc|work> oh
[03:30:54] <entuland> areas have to be unique inside a definition, and they have to define rectangular areas
[03:32:12] * doc|work tries
[03:32:58] <entuland> you'll need some more tweaks there
[03:33:25] <entuland> cause right now in my fiddle the left and right leeways aren't taking any room due to the auto value you have in the columns definition
[03:33:41] <doc|work> that'll work, thanks
[03:33:52] <doc|work> auto's working for me alright
[03:34:10] <entuland> it's not working for me
[03:34:15] <entuland> could you share your version?
[03:34:29] <hassoon> doc|work: ithink areas with the same name should be adjacent
[03:34:32] <hassoon> i think *
[03:34:39] <hassoon> otherwise you'd break the grid areas logic
[03:34:39] <doc|work> hassoon, yeah, makes sense
[03:34:45] <doc|work> in hindsight
[03:35:01] <doc|work> entuland, https://jsfiddle.net/j4f6c08p/4/
[03:35:24] <entuland> eh, but you wanted the header to grow larger than leftnav and main?
[03:35:40] <entuland> maybe I misunderstood your original target
[03:35:58] <doc|work> entuland, https://jsfiddle.net/j4f6c08p/6/
[03:36:19] <doc|work> yeah, forgot to copy that from actual work to jsfiddle
[03:36:37] <hassoon> doc|work: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/312
[03:36:40] <entuland> ah good, it wasn't working for me cause I had the window too narrow or something
[03:37:03] <doc|work> yeah, I was getting weird stuff too until I widened things out
[03:37:26] <entuland> you have a 1px off scrollbar or something, but that's easy to remove

[10:01:00] <FunkyBob> are you new to react?
[10:01:06] <FunkyBob> it took me a while to get a handle on it
[10:01:11] <Rockwood_> https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html
[10:01:18] <Rockwood_> i am new in react yes
[10:02:17] <FunkyBob> so the first argument to a function component is the props object... when you do ({ props }) => ... you've unpacked props and grabbed only the 'props' entry from it
[10:02:31] <FunkyBob> const MenuHandler = ({ props }) => {
[10:02:45] <FunkyBob> however, you never passed it a prop called props, only:   return <MenuHandler bar={topBar} />;
[10:03:02] <FunkyBob> or what would have been called 'items' in my version of the code
[10:03:31] <FunkyBob> since I was expecting a list of menu items
[10:04:37] <Rockwood_> https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010
[10:04:55] <Rockwood_> why its functional?
[10:05:16] <FunkyBob> sorry?
[10:05:20] <FunkyBob> why is what functional?
[10:05:58] <Rockwood_> https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010 here props i passed
[10:08:10] <FunkyBob> I think you forgot to save your codepen... it's empty
[10:08:38] <Rockwood_> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/QWvweaL?editors=0010
[10:08:48] <Rockwood_> oops
[10:09:03] <Rockwood_> sorry for previous link
[10:09:13] <FunkyBob> ok... so.. what's the question?
[10:09:33] <Rockwood_> here i passed props correctly
[10:09:40] <Rockwood_> in codepen example
[10:09:55] <FunkyBob> you passed them correctly both times...
[10:10:08] <FunkyBob> but  (props) and ({ props }) are very different things
[10:10:28] <Rockwood_> ok
[10:10:35] <FunkyBob> consider if you rewrote  your component as function Welcome({ name }) { return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>; }
[10:10:55] <FunkyBob> see how the { name }   .. .has taken props and 'unpacked' the 'name' key from it?
[10:11:10] <FunkyBob> aka destructuring

[10:11:22] <FunkyBob> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring
[10:11:45] <FunkyBob> anyway... i have to leave for the gym
[10:11:49] <FunkyBob> back in a while

[10:43:33] <wallbroken> is there somebody who could help me with that?
[10:43:51] <wallbroken> i want to execute the javascript not when i flag the checkbox
[10:44:18] <wallbroken> but only after i click on "submit" button, about those item where i have the checkbox flagged
[10:50:24] <undefined_bob> wallbroken: maybe try asking an #javascript?

[10:57:14] <wallbroken> undefined_bob: i did
[11:00:06] <undefined_bob> and they said to ask here? lol
[11:02:37] <wallbroken> they haven't answered
[11:03:32] <undefined_bob> maybe you need to be more patient :( most Americans are asleep right now
[11:04:28] <undefined_bob> sadly I cant really help you much with js
[11:23:23] <wallbroken> undefined_bob: this is the answer i got:
[11:23:24] <wallbroken> 8:51:09 AM - robertmaxrees: sounds like a good time to learn then :)
[11:23:31] <wallbroken> very useful help
[11:27:12] <oksushi> wallbroken: IRC channels are separated by topic. This is the CSS channel
[11:28:06] <wallbroken> ok, and is there a channel where people want to help me without telling unuseful statements like "learn javascript" ?
[11:29:05] <oksushi> wallbroken: everyone on IRC is a volunteer, no one works for you
[11:29:52] <undefined_bob> well, thats a good answer imo. Read into it, learn, ask when you're stuck at one point
[11:30:29] <undefined_bob> If you want someone who do all your coding for you, go hire a freelancer ^^
[11:30:30] <wallbroken> undefined_bob: well. i don't know anything about javascript
[11:31:21] <wallbroken> and i pay it of 5 minutes of work?
[11:31:31] <wallbroken> *him
[11:31:37] <undefined_bob> then you either have to learn or pay someone do to it for you or be lucky enough to find someone kind enough who do it for you
[11:31:59] <undefined_bob> how can you know its only 5 minutes if you know nothing about coding
[11:32:21] <wallbroken> because i'm a C# developer
[11:32:43] <undefined_bob> then js shouldn't be a problem for you
[11:33:27] <wallbroken> i don't know if what i want to do, can be done
[11:33:28] <wallbroken> maybe not
