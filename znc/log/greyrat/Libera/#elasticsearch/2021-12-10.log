[02:11:58] <inflatador> NM, looks like if you pass "refresh=True," the client will completely delete the document

[22:03:59] <sy> Hi everyone
[22:04:15] <sy> Is 1G RAM going to cut it for 3 elasticsearch master instances on one box?
[22:16:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> if your index is tiny, sure.
[22:16:30] <NoImNotNineVolt> and if your load is tiny.
[22:25:39] <sy> ahh neither of those in my case
[22:25:55] <sy> can I make a node that was previously a non master a standalone node?
[22:26:36] <sy> I had 2 nodes and 1 master, now I only have the 2 nodes and need to spin up, figured the easiest way was to remove one, but they remember they weren't a master and they refuse to be one
