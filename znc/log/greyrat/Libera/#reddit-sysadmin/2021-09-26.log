[06:23:39] <dragonfleas> how necessary is learning python

[06:37:19] <Cl0udNinja> I'd say yes. python is a pretty well used lang. python isnt my strongest and I really struggle with it, but find a lot of uses for it, or find things its already doing at work
[06:38:32] <BWMerlin> If you are able to learn another language why not?

[06:41:49] <dragonfleas> i just fucking hate tab dependent syntax
[06:41:52] <Cl0udNinja> I'd argue that powershell isnt a language
[06:41:54] <dragonfleas> imo it's the ugliest shit ever
[06:42:10] <Cl0udNinja> agreed there dragonfleas, one of the reasons I dislike python
[06:42:27] <dragonfleas> i mean
[06:42:39] <Cl0udNinja> especially if I just wanna try out one little thing. why the fuck I gotta take the extra time to tab that shit to be all pretty just so you can fuckin execute it
[06:42:40] <dragonfleas> powershell is a scripting language
[06:42:54] <dragonfleas> i wouldn't put it at the same level as something like javscript or c# but it's a language that has it's use cases
[06:43:13] <BWMerlin> I didn't think python used tabs but rather spaces and was called a "white space significant" language because of that

[09:56:45] <Hunterkll> no root devices, lol
[09:56:49] <Hunterkll> hope there's a prior kernel
[09:57:36] <Cl0udNinja> can you even change the kernel without being in the system on a linode? i've never looked at the ui more than once and use the cli for everything
[09:58:12] <Hunterkll> I mean, their web console IS showing me the kernel panic so 
[09:58:37] <Hunterkll> but i can apparently change the boot from grub to *their* kernel
[09:58:38] <Cl0udNinja> that doesnt mean you get console access :P
[09:58:39] <Hunterkll> and that'll work 
[09:58:44] <Hunterkll> there's also a console that does stuff
[09:58:55] <Cl0udNinja> oh. neat. I had no idea
[09:59:01] <Hunterkll> yea it drops me into glish when the system is poewred off
[09:59:40] <Hunterkll> powering onwith their kernel
[10:00:00] <Hunterkll> that w orked just fine

[10:00:21] <Hunterkll> that was the fix 
[10:00:48] <Hunterkll> not the fix i wanted, but it's better than none
[10:01:04] <Cl0udNinja> are you using linodes mirrors?
[10:01:39] <Hunterkll> hm no
[10:01:42] <Hunterkll> just a single instance
[10:01:52] <Hunterkll> its an ipsec end point to extend a non-local ipv4 to a local network 
[10:02:57] <Cl0udNinja> idk if you'd get the same kernel version from their mirrors. I know gcp/aws have their linux stuff set to use their mirrors which have custom kernels
[10:02:59] <Hunterkll> no backups since the whole build is literally just 2 config files and a configured key 
[10:03:04] <Hunterkll> ohhh
[10:03:05] <Hunterkll> no no

[10:03:51] <Cl0udNinja> ah then it should have their mirrors by default I think, so that shouldnt matter probably

[10:04:41] <Hunterkll> yea but using custom kernels leaves a bad taste in my mouth

[11:05:52] <Cl0udNinja> either that or sqlite decided it needed to have all 4million of its copies
[11:06:11] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: a shitload of sqlite fail2ban db's 
[11:06:19] <Hunterkll> all with the same date
[11:06:22] <Cl0udNinja> heh
[11:06:38] <Cl0udNinja> might wanna disable fail2ban for a bit
[11:06:44] <Hunterkll> best i can do dawg is call my expert in and disable fail2ban
[11:06:48] <Hunterkll> he might know what to do
[11:06:49] <Hunterkll> damnit
[11:07:04] <Hunterkll> didn't give me enough time to pawnstar's it 
[11:07:05] <Hunterkll> LOL
[11:07:09] <Cl0udNinja> hahah
[11:07:19] <Cl0udNinja> gotta be faster
[11:07:27] <Hunterkll> i think it's recreating backups it didn't have
[11:08:02] <Hunterkll> time for some music while i fix this 
[11:08:12] <Cl0udNinja> I think you're right

[11:09:42] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: i think that might mean database corruption too
[11:10:04] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: which also means my ability to ssh in is governed only by higher firewall rules 
[11:10:52] <csws> thegodsquirrel, ok so I tried the PER620 ISO from last night
[11:10:55] <csws> looks like it worked
[11:11:12] <csws> it took aaaages to update but got there in the end
[11:11:54] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: disabled it, rebooting into linode kernel with service disabled and ALL files deelted including the active database
[11:12:11] <Cl0udNinja> yeah the whole fail2ban db is probably fubared
[11:12:45] <Hunterkll> it's gone now
[11:12:52] <Hunterkll> i don't care a whit about that, so 
[11:13:14] <csws> thegodsquirrel, went from 1.57.57.00 to 2.65.65.65
[11:13:17] <csws> lol these version numbers too
[11:13:50] <DrZak> yea
[11:13:55] <DrZak> somebody was too bored
[11:14:07] <csws> man I should update esxi while I'm at it

[11:14:23] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: gonna try and reboot with grub2, what if it couldn't mount 
[11:14:29] <Hunterkll> because of disk usage
[11:14:35] <Cl0udNinja> and then LOGABUSE has a commented out line for debug and a -j drop
[11:15:08] <Hunterkll> down and rebooting
[11:15:15] <Hunterkll> ima laugh if it boots up 
[11:15:19] <Cl0udNinja> possible, but I'm betting the state of everything else is just a mess atm
[11:15:37] <Hunterkll> yea but now we won't get disk fill issues  
[11:15:42] <Cl0udNinja> true
[11:15:48] <Hunterkll> oh shit
[11:15:53] <Hunterkll> you DO get grub menu 
[11:16:00] <Hunterkll> on the web console of linode
[11:16:02] <Hunterkll> just saw it
[11:16:09] <Hunterkll> still KP but 
[11:16:35] <Hunterkll> doing a force power offf
[11:16:37] <Cl0udNinja> but thats the linode grub right? not grub from the system?
[11:17:00] <Hunterkll> grub in the console.....
[11:17:04] <Hunterkll> which reads on system
[11:17:07] <Hunterkll> and it's using KVM 
[11:17:41] <Hunterkll> but if i catch it i could POSSIBLY boot previous kernel
[11:18:03] <Cl0udNinja> if its reading a grub config from your system you can just change the timeout :D
[11:19:04] <csws> man java.com is a time capsule
[11:19:24] <csws> feels like they haven't touched the design in 10 years
[11:19:33] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[11:19:35] <Cl0udNinja> they havent
[11:19:45] <Hunterkll> websites that have i'm like: WHY THE FUCK DID YOU FUCK THIS UP
[11:19:52] <Hunterkll> so maybe they playin' it safe
[11:20:03] <csws> eventually java.com will just go to an oracle SSO probably
[11:20:05] * Cl0udNinja cough AWS UI cough
[11:20:09] <csws> i'll cry if so
[11:20:54] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: booting it into the linode kernel to see if that's possible :P

[11:22:13] <csws> such a dummy
[11:22:37] <Cl0udNinja> EVERYONE GETS SPACE PROBLEMS TONIGHT
[11:22:40] <Cl0udNinja> whose next?
[11:22:47] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: as much as i use grub now i'm not quite familiar - set timeoute= is the option i want?
[11:22:48] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, you wanna join the out of spaceparty?
[11:23:31] <Cl0udNinja> uhm... you'll have to google that Hunterkll I cant remember off the top of my head but I have "GRUB_TIMEOUT=5" in my /etc/default/grub
[11:23:53] <Hunterkll> ah i'm looking in /boot
[11:24:11] <Hunterkll> i assume /etc just applies when you reconfig 
[11:24:18] <Cl0udNinja> I'm on a debian system, they use values from default to apply to the grub.cfg
[11:24:31] <Cl0udNinja> as part of the update-grub
[11:24:34] <Hunterkll> right, i'm modifying grub.cfg directly 
[11:24:42] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, should be good to just set it there
[11:25:41] <Hunterkll> doubled the time, should let me catch it
[11:25:52] <Hunterkll> i'm used to using firmware based boot loaders 
[11:26:13] <Hunterkll> like openfirmware etc
[11:26:27] <csws> Cl0udNinja, apparently it's caused by the swapfile being on the USB stick. moved to a datastore now and let's see how it goes
[11:26:45] <Hunterkll> DAMNIT
[11:26:55] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: i saw IPXE then login
[11:26:56] <Hunterkll> oh wait
[11:27:01] <Hunterkll> i didnt configure it back
[11:27:04] <csws> lol
[11:27:33] <Hunterkll> reboot ordered
[11:27:44] <Cl0udNinja> would you like fries with that?
[11:27:52] <Hunterkll> yes please
[11:27:57] <Cl0udNinja> sorry we're all out
[11:28:07] <Hunterkll> GOT INTERACTIVE GRUB MENU
[11:28:14] <Cl0udNinja> nice
[11:28:26] <Hunterkll> previous kernel boots
[11:28:30] <Cl0udNinja> nice
[11:28:41] <DrZak> i always felt that menu would be improved by adding random blinking elements
[11:28:47] <Hunterkll> without using linode kernel
[11:28:56] <Hunterkll> so its something with the update obviously
[11:29:00] <Hunterkll> and probably m odules
[11:29:05] <Hunterkll> and probably initrd
[11:29:08] <Hunterkll> er initramfs
[11:29:20] <Cl0udNinja> yeah the out of space shit broke the update so shit didnt get installed probably or initramfs failed to actually do its thing
[11:30:38] <Hunterkll> yum is clean
[11:31:03] <Cl0udNinja> initramfs -u
[11:31:10] <Hunterkll> reinstalling the kernel  
[11:31:16] <Cl0udNinja> yeah that works too
[11:32:28] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: oh no
[11:32:37] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: network manager interfering wtih resolv.conf
[11:32:38] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:32:52] <Hunterkll> i have NO nameservers
[11:32:54] <Cl0udNinja> man, I hate network manager
[11:32:58] <Cl0udNinja> YOU DONT NEED NAMESERVERS
[11:33:08] <Cl0udNinja> YOU CALL YOURSELF LEET? YOU DONT REMEMBER IPS?!?!
[11:33:32] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: would you remember an ipv6 /48 ?
[11:33:53] <Cl0udNinja> idk, I can remember ur moms number though :D

[11:38:43] <Hunterkll> failed to write to ifcfg-eth0
[11:38:51] <DrZak> wat
[11:38:58] <Cl0udNinja> man...
[11:39:00] <Hunterkll> from nmtui 
[11:39:01] <Hunterkll> as root
[11:39:02] <Cl0udNinja> set this system on fire
[11:39:04] <Cl0udNinja> oh

[11:39:06] <Cl0udNinja> fuck nm

[11:39:11] <Hunterkll> LOL
[11:39:32] <Hunterkll> kill %1 done
[11:39:32] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:39:40] <Cl0udNinja> I've never had the network manager shit be useful
[11:39:44] <DrZak> i did wonder about my sanity when i start to thinkg writing to resolveconf went to the network config
[11:39:47] <Cl0udNinja> shits nothin but a problem
[11:40:50] <Cl0udNinja> only time network manager seems to work is during centos install lol
[11:40:53] <DrZak> gotta decide when it is the time to throw in the towel
[11:41:43] <Hunterkll> oh this isn't throw in the towel time 
[11:41:50] <Hunterkll> cuz i can manually fix this
[11:41:53] <Cl0udNinja> I'd suggest finding the nearest active volcano and throwing it in
[11:41:59] <Cl0udNinja> it seems to be possessed
[11:42:03] <Hunterkll> with THIS kernel 
[11:42:23] <A-KO> what's up
[11:42:50] <Hunterkll> A-KO: my external endpoint for exchange blew up lol
[11:42:59] <A-KO> fail
[11:43:02] <A-KO> why you blowing your shit up?
[11:43:11] <Hunterkll> A-KO: i updated it without a snapshot XD
[11:43:12] <Cl0udNinja> fail2ban banned his system by filling up space
[11:43:17] <Hunterkll> that too
[11:43:27] <Hunterkll> i ran yum update on a full disk without realizing it
[11:44:07] <Hunterkll>  and it "appeared" to work with no failures
[11:45:23] <Hunterkll> A-KO: i was trying to update my exchange lol
[11:45:36] <Hunterkll> realized it had no network
[11:45:37] <Hunterkll> XD
[11:45:39] <Cl0udNinja> ... wow you fell down a fuckin rabbithole didnt ya
[11:46:01] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: my home exchange is the only thing using PBR to this  linode instance
[11:46:06] <Hunterkll> it's basically a NAT gateway 
[11:47:22] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: in a 'real' environemnt i'd never have a setup like this lol
[11:47:29] <Cl0udNinja> I just meant that you went from 'I need to update exchange' to 'oh god I broke my gateway'
[11:47:49] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: i haven't even brought up my load balancer in 2 months
[11:47:53] <Hunterkll> this is prep work for th at
[11:52:13] <Hunterkll> A-KO: tl;dr, yum update 'succeded'

[12:04:26] <Hunterkll> i fixed the disk issue 
[12:04:34] <Hunterkll> i have 21G now
[12:04:35] <Cl0udNinja> or you can but you have to pay extra and its not really cheap iirc

[12:38:26] <Hunterkll> not weird at all
[12:38:29] <csws> might also be because I replaced a dead RAM module too
