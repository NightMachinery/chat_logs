[22:06:38] <jaawerth> ok this is driving me nuts. the documentation and online searhcing I've done all seems sure that pandoc will try to resolve css assets against XDG_DATA_HOME when using standalone, and a resource path like `.:styles` would resolve the current dir, then ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/pandoc/styles . That all seems to make sense, but
[22:07:08] <jaawerth> If I use `-d yamlfilename`, it resolves *that*, but no matter what I put for non-absolute paths for `css:` or `resource-path` it absolutely doesn't want to find it. Even if I dont' use -d and try too just use `--css` with a path relative to ~/.local/share/pandoc, no dice. Am I misreading something?
[22:07:29] <jaawerth> it sounds like windows may hve ifferent behaviors, but I'm just on arch, nothin' special in terms of config
[22:08:21] <jaawerth> would appreciat any pointers - since I was hoping to synch this stuff in my dotfiles, where possible I would like to not need to put in absolute paths, so I can make use of XDG to relocate stuff when I need to
