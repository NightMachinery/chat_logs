[03:04:34] <rk4> likely at the moment you have a giant windows partition, an efi parition, maybe a OEM recovery partition, normally one would shrink the windows partition. the installer docs might describe how that works, in years past sometimes you had to defrag first but i don't know how it works today
[03:04:55] <rk4> you'll likely at the end of the install end up with grub as your bootloader
[03:05:11] <rk4> if it's just for a test this might be annoying for you to undo later...
[03:05:14] <godSend23> enyc said: for the  windows vms"they can use "bridged" networking and still act in their original way"
[03:05:18] <godSend23> do u agree?

[03:07:24] <godSend23> installer docs for debian?
[03:07:25] <sney> yes, a lot of people use linux to host windows VMs, with multiple networking options. bridging is one. usually it's good to use 1 nic for the management interface and the linux server ip, and then a separate nic to bridge for the vm guests, but that's not required if it's low traffic

[03:08:37] <rk4> it's just if your goal is to run a bunch of windows VMs, having to learn how to run linux to do it seems a bit...all over the place
[03:08:38] <sney> rk4: nah, they can all do it.
[03:09:13] <rk4> just like me trying to use windows to run my linux VMs would cause me a lot of strife
[03:09:29] <sney> the benefit of linux as the hypervisor is that it doesn't use up any windows licenses, and windows OSes that typically don't like being virtualized (e.g. Home edition) become an option
[03:10:22] <godSend23> in my case it's winxp
[03:10:41] <rk4> fair point about saving a windows license

[03:10:55] * sney had a vendor ship a low spec desktop pc with 7 Home running a production appliance, it was much better as a VM on something with redundancy 
[03:11:02] <godSend23> i could use a windows server rk4 but linux is more stable?
[03:11:07] <sney> nah
[03:11:21] <rk4> linux's stability and security revolve around your own skill

[03:50:09] <Blondie101010> you could skip data you don't care about, but you'd still have to read it
[03:50:58] <Blondie101010> there's no control layer, so if you read from it, it's a plain pipe
[03:51:01] <PMT> AIUI, historically, the main difference here was that character devices did not buffer, block devices did, and you got both as options. (See Solaris's notion of /dev/dsk versus /dev/rdsk). FreeBSD decided it wanted only one of those. Linux went with the other.
[03:51:28] <PMT> Character devices are not required to not allow random access, they are just not required to allow it. Block devices are required to implement it.

[11:25:13] <Blondie101010> but my point on dual boot and hybernation will probably cause you to ask a dozen questions in the next few months
[11:25:36] <rudi_s> How is hibernation and dual boot causing issues?
[11:26:00] <Blondie101010> recovering from hybernation does not initialize the hardware in the same way as booting

[11:26:33] <godSend23> partitioning and all
[11:26:33] <rudi_s> Are we talking about suspend or hibernation here? I don't know how Windows does it, but on Linux hibernation is a full restart.
[11:26:48] <godSend23> and the parameters awal1 and urself brought up
[11:27:03] <Blondie101010> rudi_s:  those problems are quite common
[11:27:15] <godSend23> aye carumba
[11:27:17] <Blondie101010> it even happens without hybernation

[11:27:44] <rudi_s> And I've never heard of it or had any issues (but I'm not doing any fancy stuff in my dual boot scenarios).
[11:28:16] <rudi_s> godSend23: Just get a basic understanding how it works, create a backup of the machine (always a good idea) and then just do it.
[11:28:27] <Blondie101010> I honestly haven't dual booted in a long time, but it used to be quite common
[11:28:28] <rudi_s> There might be minor issues but you can figure them out later.

[11:36:54] <rudi_s> shtrb: Yes
[11:37:29] <Blondie101010> shtrb:  /etc/resolv.conf is the main DNS resolver config file on Linux if that's the question...  other factors will affect how the resolution is handled though
[11:38:21] <shtrb> Any guess how if I dropped the ipv6 dns server address I still get the ipv6 hosts resolved ?
[11:38:21] <Blondie101010> for example, resolvd will overwrite it to point to itself, and nsswitch will be used to decide how to handle hostname lookups
[11:39:06] <rudi_s> shtrb: Yes
[11:39:15] <Blondie101010> shtrb:  yes, DNS resolvers are mandated to return AAAA records even on IPv4
[11:39:29] <rudi_s> The addresses in resolv.conf only control what is used as (recursive) resolver.
[11:39:30] <shtrb> s/dropped the ipv6 dns server/dropped the dns nameserver with ipv6 address
[11:39:35] <Blondie101010> the client asks AAAA, the server returns it
[11:39:54] <shtrb> a dns server with ipv4 address would answer that ?
[11:39:55] <rudi_s> gai.conf controls (among other things) if IPv6 is used.
[11:39:58] <rudi_s> Yes
[11:40:01] <shtrb> thanks
[11:40:26] <rudi_s> How you reach the server is completely unrelated to what kind of responses you get.

[11:46:04] <shtrb> rudi_s, my ISP is a crappy ISP
[11:46:15] <rudi_s> And not everything respects gai.conf. Browsers for example often decide that differently.
[11:46:37] <rudi_s> shtrb: So? Just don't configure a public IPv6 address if you don't want to use that. That's way easier than using gai.conf.

[11:50:19] <shtrb> They had been quite good, gave ipv6 for free, and for a long time it just worked, now I don't know what

[11:51:53] <shtrb> I don't even know what IPv6 behind nat mean
[11:52:07] <rudi_s> If you want to use IPv6 internally use ULAs which won't get used for public traffic (most of the time).
[11:52:33] <rudi_s> Well, either they mean natted IPv6 (so you only get ULA addresses, but not public ones), but that's unlikely.
[11:52:49] <rudi_s> Maybe they mean CGNAT or similar where they use NAT for IPv4 but provide public IPv6 addresses.

[12:53:23] <PMT> My general impression right now is that discrete PCIe NVIDIA GPUs made in the last 5 years or so of a given release don't have almost any caveats for the proprietary driver, nouveau is much more hit or miss and often involves long periods of "NVIDIA promised they'd give us the signed firmware blobs we need to load to do anything useful with this but they haven't yet", and AMD GPUs have an unfortunate habit of
[12:53:29] <PMT> having a lag time between GPU release and driver support, and then needing the latest kernel in order for things to work. Laptops or other specialized setups can be more hit or miss or strange.

Live images are available from http://www.debian.org/CD/live/ .  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive  #debian-live on irc.debian.org; also see <live login>, <uefi live>.
[15:03:19] <godSend23> but this one is not both?
[15:04:20] <Khepra> can you reprhase that question?
[15:05:00] <Khepra> maybe oyu mean....    no, the installer ISOs are separate from "live env" ISOs which, as the bot says, aren't recommended for installing.

[15:05:29] <godSend23> ohhhh
[15:05:50] <Khepra> by default, you get the netinst ISO if you click that badass Download button, but on that page are Other releases which could lead you, eventually (but you'll need GPS and a map!)  to other installer ISOs, like teh CD, or the DVD editions
[15:06:12] <Khepra> unfortunately, you need the arcane invocations that instrument our silicon friend, the dpkg here, to shed some light on the cobwebby, darkened paths toward the live CD. these are so obscure and unwanted, unnamable.... eldritch.... things, that are forbidden to be easily linked to from the debian.org main page.

[15:09:15] <PMT> ...so clicking two links instead of one is a maze? I really wonder how your brain works.
[15:09:17] *** Joins: pankid (~quassel@pankid.club)
[15:09:54] <PMT> There are plenty of things on Debian that are obscure mazes of twisty passages, but this doesn't seem like one.
[15:10:00] <Khepra> the installer ISOs boot straight into the Installer program. the live env ISOs are live environments (can't remember if ti's gnome or xfce) which also include "an" installer, the Calamari, which is different from the, uh... "installer" ISOs, and not recommended to be used
[15:10:01] <n4dir>  godSend23: most distributions, at least many, have both: live-iso and installation-option on the same iso. Debian is of the ones which doesn't do it that way.

[15:10:57] <godSend23> how can I know ahead of time?
[15:10:59] <PMT> godSend23: Debian has been doing this since before livecds were common on installers. So if your complaint is "be consistent", Debian has, in fact, been.
[15:11:00] <n4dir> yeah, good then. if you heard something bout "linux in general, this and that way", regarding the Download iso, debian differs

[15:11:36] <n4dir> debian introduced live-CDs very late, and they never really got that much love
[15:11:54] <godSend23> is there anyway to self-check an iso to see if it has dual functions?

[15:12:20] <shtrb> !hybridcd

[15:13:25] <Khepra> 100% :)
[15:14:05] <Khepra> Ubuntu has one, "live" environment which also doubles as the official installer.
[15:14:06] <n4dir> hmm. Well, no need to get in a discussion over this. - Still it ain't that unusual debian usually having an installation-image.
[15:14:38] <PMT> Khepra: Ubuntu at least used to have just an installation ISO for non-desktop envs. I haven't looked recently to see if they removed it in favor of cloud-init or something.
[15:15:05] <godSend23> how can one know if an iso has both functions?

[15:16:38] <n4dir> it's size might be a good hint
[15:16:42] <PMT> There is no magic program you can run that will tell you, no.

[15:17:22] <godSend23> ok 3 ways
[15:17:58] <abff> or the sha
[15:18:14] <godSend23> say i put the debian default netinst on a ventoy usb, it will definitely NOT boot to a liveOS then

[15:19:58] <godSend23> ok ok thanks guys
[15:20:02] <Khepra> and that's another thing about "live" env that's a bit vague. do you include GUI or not.  because ubuntu also offers "server live ISOs"
[15:20:38] <godSend23> oy ve...
[15:20:44] <godSend23> how many ways to slice the cake
[15:20:47] <abff> Khepra: I tend to consider live as "doing something other than installing itself for me"?
[15:20:50] <Khepra> in that respect the gentoo installer ISO is a "live" env because you get a shell with most of the installation/rescue toosl available.  debian's netinst doesn't
[15:21:10] <Khepra> (but gentoo also has KDE based "live" desktopy thingy ISO, so there's that)

[16:35:05] <hansol> not working
[16:35:41] <Khepra> f-a: well, ~/.xinitrc is the client script for xinit, used when you startx.  you put invocations to your DE or WM binaries in that, not screensaver
[16:35:55] <PMT> the expected syntax is ssh-copy-id [user@]hostname, I believe. No additional argument.
[16:36:18] <f-a> Khepra: sorry I shold have mentioned, no DE, I just invoke startx
[16:36:27] <f-a> hence why I put that here
[16:36:44] <n4dir> DE doesn't really indicate if you use startx or a display-manager though
[16:37:10] <f-a> scrap that then, I do not have a DE
[16:38:26] <Khepra> f-a: you can have a DE with startx, the two are orthogonal. the only constraint is that some modern DEs require specific apis of, say, GDM, and startx is difficult without fiddling with the session
[16:38:49] <Khepra> startx merely starts xorg. xinitrc then in turn starts the first programs under xorg, which is typically a WM or DE

[19:47:02] <somiaj> there are various means for updates, not everything uses the debian alternatve's system. xdg-open also controls a lot of desktop oriented things, so use xdg-settings to update the default browser for apps that use the xdg-open to figure out default app
[19:48:10] <somiaj> but if you want to use the debian alternative's system (which is just links), you should properly add and configure an altnerative for the one you want to change to play nicely with packages that also use that
[19:48:39] <holycow> ok
[19:49:17] <somiaj> but if your goal is to change what browser is used by applications in a desktop setting, xdg-settings is the tool that will most likely change the default

[20:20:54] <brentaarnold> That makes sense. My question is can most devices that only support FTP output to it such as a firewall syslog?
[20:20:58] <XileX> I have been using Konsole as my terminal application
[20:21:03] <PMT> huh. i guess it's trying to print things to the screen and noticing when it's not the active tty. wonder why/how.
[20:21:12] <Khepra> brentaarnold: "output to it"?
[20:21:34] <brentaarnold> Wait, let me rethink that sentence because it came out dumb af
[20:21:55] <brentaarnold> Can a device that only supports FTP and not SFTP still send something to VSFTP
[20:22:32] <brentaarnold> Second sentence equally dumb but there you are, best I got
[20:22:36] <PMT> vsftpd is a server which implements FTP.
[20:22:42] <brentaarnold> I see
[20:22:53] <PMT> So yes, FTP clients will work with it.
[20:22:59] <brentaarnold> Thank you
[20:23:01] <PMT> That said, what are you using that only supports FTP?
[20:23:06] <Blondie101010> brentaarnold:  how could you know the package name and not its description?
[20:23:09] <brentaarnold> some old printers, etc.
[20:23:21] <PMT> Blondie101010: someone mentioned it.
[20:23:28] <brentaarnold> Of course that would be SNMP probably
[20:23:29] <Blondie101010> ah
[20:23:39] <brentaarnold> I'm just trying to understand what the modern secure FTP solution is
[20:23:43] <brentaarnold> And you've answered it
[20:23:48] <Blondie101010> it's not FTP
[20:24:01] <Blondie101010> but if you want/need FTP, then so be it
[20:24:06] <Khepra> the question is what secure _FTP_ solution is. the answer can't be "it's not FTP"
[20:24:20] <Blondie101010> it can and is
[20:24:22] <brentaarnold> Gangster ass Blondie with the big brain statements
[20:24:27] <brentaarnold> What do you recommend then Blondie101010
[20:24:29] <Khepra> also.... taht myth should REALLY die.  FTP can do fully encrypted control AND data channels, so it's not that different from SFTP
[20:24:30] <Blondie101010> sftp
[20:24:40] <brentaarnold> Over VSFTP?
[20:24:48] <PMT> Khepra: presuming the clients implement it.
[20:24:50] <brentaarnold> As in you prefer SFTP to VSFTP?
[20:24:53] <Blondie101010> openssh supports it
[20:24:57] <Blondie101010> nothing fancy to instal
[20:25:07] <brentaarnold> I seen that in the Debian Apt list
[20:25:11] <Khepra> brentaarnold: FTP is a protocol. SFTP is not a FTP protocol, it's (open)SSH. if you're confined to FTP only, then openssh-sftp is useless in that cases.
[20:25:16] <PMT> VSFTP is not a thing. it's just part of the name of a program.
[20:25:18] <Khepra> PMT: yes of course
[20:25:34] <brentaarnold> Khepra: That makes way more sense, thank you
[20:26:07] <Blondie101010> brentaarnold:  so asking what modern solution is compatible with something that only supports FTP, is still the old FTP
[20:26:17] <brentaarnold> Blondie101010: I see.
[20:26:25] <Blondie101010> but you should validate it doesn't support sftp or better protocols
[20:26:43] <brentaarnold> As long as the FTP server isn't publicly exposed it shouldn't be too big of a deal, this is another down in the boonies client with only five computers.
[20:26:47] <Blondie101010> s/or/or other
[20:26:48] <PMT> Khepra: in particular, assuming a client that couldn't be bothered to implement an alternative implements encryption over stock FTP seems like a big assumption.
[20:26:49] <xx> after upgrade to bullseye, I have many files in /etc/ that have gained the suffix .dpkg-transfer, what's that about?
[20:27:15] <Blondie101010> brentaarnold:  sure, but you asked that seemingly useless question
[20:27:21] <Blondie101010> if you need something, install it
[20:27:25] <brentaarnold> Blondie101010: lmao, true
[20:27:39] <brentaarnold> Blondie101010: Gangster ass mf with the big D answers
[20:27:42] <XileX> PMT: That was the case. When I disabled printing, it also worked fine without screen. Good job finding the issue
[20:27:45] <brentaarnold> Blondie101010 a beast
[20:27:59] <PMT> XileX: I still think that shouldn't have happened, but...okay.
[20:28:30] <XileX> Yeah. It should not work like it does now
[20:28:43] <brentaarnold> Blondie101010: How long you been in the industry dude?
[20:28:44] <Khepra> PMT: well I was talking about the myth of FTP in general. FTP, the protocol, allows both data and control channels to be encrypted.  the myth stems from the misconception that only control channel is encrypted.

[22:29:46] <jkc> The strongest recommendation, and the best one, is don't.
[22:30:20] <jkc> Control panels like cPanel, webmin, etc, absolutely gut your system, and after that, you don't really have a Debian box anymore. Certainly wouldn't be supportable here.

[23:09:56] <Khepra> it's total utter garbage, and I don't mean that like Lunduke would. I mean literally.
[23:10:16] <n4dir> i seem to recall the other day somoeone asked how to kill a process in a D state, but don't remember any more
[23:11:14] <PMT> That article seems to be a shitpost. Or actual garbage. I stopped reading after concluding it sounded like something someone would write to drag people when open source first started growing.
[23:11:27] <PMT> n4dir: you don't, as far as I know.
[23:11:46] <n4dir> PMT: that might well have been the result. I forgot
[23:11:49] <Khepra> billions of dollars invested through thousands of companies, and linux can't kill a process in D state. Trash.       so, how are winters in New Zea^W Aotearoa? Do I need to pack up a lot? Wait, they're entering summer now, right? Yeah, I'll pack light then.

[23:16:37] <Blondie101010> the fact that you don't understand something does not make it bad

[23:25:01] <Blondie101010> anyways, the problem you experienced can be reproduced quite closely on Windows
[23:25:16] <Blondie101010> so stop complaining for nothing and learn how to use your system
[23:26:05] <Khepra> I'm just miffed that a basic operation like that, ordering a process to shutdown and/or ditching the hardware identifier/device/descriptor  is apparently too much to ask from a 2021 kernel.
[23:26:27] <Khepra> there's nothing to learn here, you can't kill a process in D state.
[23:26:33] <Blondie101010> you're confused
[23:26:39] <Khepra> no, you are.
[23:26:44] <Blondie101010> you froze the USB driver
[23:26:55] <Blondie101010> I know it's far from perfect
[23:27:09] <Blondie101010> stop doing crap and it'll behave better
[23:27:11] <rudi_s> Blondie101010: Killing the parent won't help for processes in D state. You need either kill the process providing the IO (e.g. sshfs or similar) or somehow get the kernel to detach the IO provider (often not possible).
[23:27:25] <Blondie101010> rudi_s:  it was the first step
[23:27:32] <Khepra> I know it froze. and that's my point, the kernel is unable to deal with that. 30 millions of lines of code and it can't detach a piece of hardware. garbage.
[23:27:34] <Blondie101010> I didn't offer to help him do it
[23:27:42] <rudi_s> Just wanted to mention that the parent is not relevant for processes in D state.
[23:27:49] <Blondie101010> oh it is
[23:28:01] <Khepra> it's irrelevant. you can kill the shell, so what. the process remains
[23:28:12] <Blondie101010> but you're right that it's not at the application layer in this case
[23:28:15] <Khepra> and if you unplug the piece of hardware in that state, teh kernel craps itself.
[23:28:23] <Blondie101010> you need to kill the driver
[23:28:39] <Blondie101010> Khepra:  not the case, though it does block the device
[23:28:41] <rudi_s> Blondie101010: And why is killing the parent relevant?
[23:28:53] <Khepra> Blondie101010: very much the case
[23:29:02] <Blondie101010> rudi_s:  that is actually the most basic reason to have a zombie
[23:29:18] <rudi_s> Zombie sure, but D is not a zombie.
[23:29:40] <Blondie101010> the parent starts a child, which then dies, but the parent is busy so it doesn't notice it (yet)
[23:29:47] <Blondie101010> killing the parent solves the basic case
[23:29:57] <rudi_s> If it's a zombie sure, but then it's in Z state, not D state.
[23:29:59] <Blondie101010> but in their IO situation, it depends on a kernel driver
[23:30:08] <Khepra> it doesn't. you've only reparented the process to pid1
[23:30:09] <Blondie101010> Z == D
[23:30:15] <Blondie101010> no
[23:30:17] <Khepra> yes
[23:30:18] <Blondie101010> that's the opposite
[23:30:36] <Blondie101010> if you kill the parent, the child's new parent becomes 1
[23:30:54] <Khepra> and that's what I said. reparented the process to pid 1
[23:31:02] <Blondie101010> you said the opposite
[23:31:11] <Khepra> no I didn't
[23:31:11] <rudi_s> Blondie101010: Z != D, D is waiting on disk I/O which happens for regular process when they wait on the disk.
[23:31:13] <Blondie101010> that child is already dead
[23:31:14] <Blondie101010> come on
[23:31:22] <Blondie101010> D is dead
[23:31:27] <PMT> no, it's really not.
[23:31:29] <Blondie101010> it does nothing, but does keep resources
[23:31:38] <Blondie101010> it's not terminated (yet)
[23:31:57] <rudi_s> Blondie101010: No. Try running sha512sum on a disk on your drive which is slower than the CPU and you'll see that it will enter D state often, e.g. in htop.
[23:32:06] <rudi_s> *on a file
[23:32:14] <Blondie101010> yes, that was wrong
[23:32:18] <Blondie101010> D != dead
[23:32:27] <PMT> we know.
[23:32:47] <Blondie101010> defunc which is similar to "not responding" in Windows
[23:33:37] <rudi_s> I don't know Windows, but "defunc" is just a zombie.
[23:33:56] <Khepra> 22:01 < Blondie101010> D is dead        22:02 < Blondie101010> D != dead                 lol
[23:34:05] <Blondie101010> I can correct myself
[23:34:09] <Blondie101010> I'm not perfect
[23:34:16] <rudi_s> Khepra: To be honest I don't know how exactly the kernel behaves with USB in your case. But normally detaching the hanging device works just fine and the kernel discovers^tm.

[23:35:59] <Khepra> hrm, it's possible there's a hardware issue with it, which brought on the D state to begin with
[23:36:01] <PMT> that's exciting. not unprecedented in my experience, but exciting.
[23:37:00] <Blondie101010> Khepra:  usb device driver issues often come from bad hardware implementation
[23:37:32] <Khepra> PMT: $1M question ... will the old dd process, still existing, now corrupt any new one trying to write to the device with the same identifier (sdc)
[23:37:34] <rudi_s> Khepra: You can reset the port via /sys I think.
[23:37:47] <Khepra> rudi_s: good idea
[23:37:50] <PMT> Khepra: i wouldn't expect so, but I've been wrong before.
[23:37:54] <Blondie101010> Khepra:  not if it's sdc, but it won't be
[23:38:26] <PMT> rudi_s: the fun part is, when i last had occasion to play with issuing USB resets and power commands manually, a number of hubs and ports either don't implement them or implement them wrong so they go away and never come back.
[23:38:38] <Khepra> I got sdc back with another USB port

[23:40:24] <PMT> rudi_s: yeah, we had a setup at $OLDJOB of a long series of USB controlled devices where sometimes the hubs they were connected to would eat it, or one of the devices would eat it, and while the hubs were chosen for explicitly claiming to support this, sometimes instead of resetting they would just...go away, and the port would no longer work until you power cycled the powered hub.
[23:40:35] <rudi_s> Khepra: Most storage is still internal (SATA, NVMe, PCIe, etc.).
[23:40:36] <PMT> (For that or any other device.)
[23:40:44] <Khepra> this is a weather server with GPS devices and no network, so I had to download some data from it to an USB stick, until the network is re-set-up

[23:43:41] <Blondie101010> I meant a peak in bandwidth usage, which can be intense when dealing with HDD cache
