[00:14:34] <rqsd> Depends on what niche you look in, I guess
[00:14:40] <yawkat> well theres already variants of it, like xchacha20 and chacha12, but there arent really core issues that would need a whole new algo right now

[00:18:45] <rqsd> At least they read the topic
[00:18:47] <ioxzev1z> rqsd, so if I want ECC keys on gpg I should just go with Curve 25519?
[00:19:30] <rqsd> ioxzev1z: From a "they probably didn't butcher the implementation" standpoint, yes. From a "I have to interoperate with clients that use Debian oldstable or oldoldstable" standpoint, you'll probably want NIST P-256 instead even if that locks you into ECDSA
[00:19:57] <rqsd> (Assuming the signing key, not the encryption key)
[00:20:15] <ioxzev1z> Is it easier to just go with good-ol'
[00:20:18] <ioxzev1z> RSA
[00:20:56] <rqsd> ioxzev1z: From a "they probably didn't butcher the implementation" standpoint, probably less so. From a "I have to interoperate with clients that use Debian oldstable or oldoldstable" standpoint, very much so
[00:21:53] <rqsd> Ultimately, it's PGP, where the biggest issue is getting it to work at all without either side just giving up entirely
[00:22:52] <ioxzev1z> tbh gpg works fine with -[s]e and -c

[00:25:49] <ioxzev1z> iirc --export --armor is easy to use, though not sure how --export works exactly, if you have a primary key with C and an encryption subkey, does it only export the encryption key for public usage or all keys related to the primary
[00:26:23] <ioxzev1z> Not too sure if --export exports the entire ID or just a specific key
