[00:04:42] <|dbotdan> Shawn Presser (@theshawwn, 2021-10-16 20:34): ‘Congratulations, you're now officially someone following me around harassing me for saying AGI is nonsense. Should I start worrying? Will you become more and more obsessed with the fact that I think AGI will never happen? | I love ML. I wanted to make something cool with <110MB.’
[00:04:53] <shawwwn> gwern be like "BUT IT'S HARDER FOR ME"
[00:04:59] <shawwwn> "PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEEEEEEEeeeee"
[00:05:18] <gwern> what?
[00:05:50] <shawwwn> that was in fact my reaction to your reply on twitter, yes
[00:06:07] <feep> is the drama resuming :3
[00:06:17] * adiabatic passes the popcorn bucket to feep
[00:06:17] <shawwwn> no no
[00:06:23] <shawwwn> give me that
[00:06:24] * feep chews slowly
[00:06:34] * shawwwn binges the entire popcorn bin in one go
[00:06:44] <shawwwn> darn, 247lbs
[00:06:48] <feep> is that legal
[00:06:51] <shawwwn> no
[00:07:08] <adiabatic> feep: it's performance art now. he's IRL nikocado avocado
[00:07:19] <gwern> it's a little weird because really small stuff is where evolution shines: the fact that the loss landscapes are super noisy/sharp and the gradients are garbage (if you can compute them at all given your need for extremely small discretized stuff like binary weights) doesn't matter to evolution strategies, they explore and ignore
[00:08:42] <gwern> if you want to compute anything interesting like 'tracking prey' with, say, 16 neurons ( https://www.pnas.org/content/110/2/696.full ), you're going to have a hard time with conventional DL and backprop
[00:08:45] <Robomot> Eight pairs of descending visual neurons in the dragonfly give wing motor centers accurate population vector of prey direction | PNAS (Intercepting a moving object requires prediction of its future location. This complex task has been solved by dragonflies, who intercept their prey in midair with a 95% success rate. …)
[00:09:02] <shawwwn> lol, I guess it's inevitable
[00:09:18] <shawwwn> ok so what happened was, I have a day job 
[00:09:25] <shawwwn> at day job, I have 220MB max to use for ML
[00:09:33] <shawwwn> more than that is painful because it doesn't fit on a single chip
[00:09:41] <shawwwn> hence, 117M is too large 
[00:09:54] <shawwwn> so I ask twitter "hey, what's a small ML model you can do something cool with?"
[00:10:07] <shawwwn> and now AGI guy is coming around being like BUT EVOLUTION WON'T WORK
[00:10:18] <shawwwn> I know evolution won't work. this is in fact *the thesis of my argument against AGI*
[00:10:27] <shawwwn> it is both the only path, and an unworkable path
[00:10:57] <shawwwn> and now, for having said anything at all, I get people commenting "BUT EVOLUTION" when I'm just trying to do some random cool thing with ml
[00:11:02] <shawwwn> woe is meeee
[00:11:11] <gwern> (no, it's totally workable, it's just you use it as little as possible)

[00:57:12] <gwern> there's always LSD for the olfaction
[00:57:12] <Filipepe> that's really unfortunate, Obormot\Arcturus
[00:57:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> I ain't taking LSD
[00:57:31] <Filipepe> ^low openess to experience
[00:57:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> And staying that way, thank you very much
[00:58:10] <Filipepe> if you took LSD it could give back your sense of smell and increase your openness hehe
[00:58:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, the price is too high
[00:58:33] <quanticle> Look, you try LSD once, then next thing you know you're in a six hour debugging session with one of Geoff Anders' acolytes
[00:58:36] <gwern> look, I think ghandi would take the murder-pill *once* if it also restored his sense of smell
[00:58:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly, what quanticle said
[00:58:48] <gwern> also, to be fair to leverage, I haven't heard LSD come up at all
[00:58:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> You will. You will...
[00:59:01] <quanticle> lol
[00:59:01] <saturn2> i think there's probably a smoker's lesion effect. the people most likely to go loopy from LSD are also the most likely to want to try LSD
[00:59:05] <gwern> (which is a little odd, does anders have something against psychedelics?)

[01:04:59] <gwern> I wonder if that's legal
[01:05:11] <kuudes> why not? it is not employment
[01:05:42] <gwern> 'An employer doesn't have to hire or keep people in jobs they can't perform, or employ people who pose a "direct threat" to safety (a significant risk of substantial harm to self or others). But an employer cannot rely on myths or stereotypes about your mental health condition when deciding whether you can perform a job or whether you pose a safety risk. Before an employer can reject you for...
[01:05:45] <kuudes> mensa has iq criteria for membership, surely you could have a association for "high iq not insane people"
[01:05:48] <gwern> ...a job based on your condition, it must have objective evidence that you can't perform your job duties, or that you would create a significant safety risk, even with a reasonable accommodation (see Question 3).' https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/depression-ptsd-other-mental-health-conditions-workplace-your-legal-rights looks like yes

[01:06:23] <kuudes> ah, indeed
[01:06:32] <gwern> I haven't seen much in the way of complaints about non-employees/workers
[01:06:51] <kuudes> well you could make an association and then use networking to hire people
[01:07:11] <gwern> like the one Progress Studies workshop I went to that leverage helped run - well, I have absolutely nothing to complain about there, y'know? it's not like geoff got up and started talking about how to efficiently purge demons
[01:07:16] <kuudes> you could have an irc channel or discord channel or whatnot where there would be formal membership requirements
[01:08:00] <kuudes> ... we could require channel members here to pass a sanity questionnaire :-O

[02:14:55] <Obormot\Gaia> Continuing my read-through of Appendix N... I read some August Derleth stories (a collection marketed as a "posthumous collaboration" with Lovecraft; the stories supposedly based on notes Lovecraft left behind and that sort of thing... seems a tendentious characterization to me)
[02:15:20] <feep> it's called a fanfic, dear
[02:15:59] <gwern> brian herbert is just following in a long tradition of exploiting dead writers
[02:16:02] <Obormot\Gaia> Didn't make it all the way through. Read about a half-dozen, that was enough. I concur with the critics who've said things along the lines of "Derleth is Lovecraft lite" or w/e. A distinctly inferior product, all told. The writing, not as sharp; the plots, derivative and predictable; the horror, weak.
[02:16:10] <gwern> that is not dead which can eternal be lied about to sell more books
[02:17:58] <Obormot\Gaia> My feeling is that if you want Lovecraft, you should read Lovecraft. He really was an excellent writer (surprisingly so, to me; _Herbert West, Reanimator_ was more enjoyable than I'd expected)
[02:19:05] <Obormot\Gaia> Now I am reading Lord Dunsany. Very exciting! He's one of the oldest (or, maybe *the* oldest?) of the authors listed, and inspired many of the others (Tolkien, Lovecraft, Howard, all owe inspiration to him)
[02:20:01] *** Joins: Mateon2 (~Thunderbi@user/mateon1)
[02:20:28] <Obormot\Gaia> _The King of Elfland's Daughter_ is the one I'm reading now. It's both amusing how old some of the fantasy tropes we're used to are, *and* (a repeating theme in this read-through) what a limited and narrow distillation is the modern take on them
[02:20:30] *** Quits: Mateon1 (~Thunderbi@user/mateon1) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[02:20:31] *** Mateon2 is now known as Mateon1
[02:22:32] <Obormot\Gaia> For example: in this story, the protagonist (a fellow named Alveric, a prince of a human kingdom) must travel to Elfland to wed the titular king's daughter. His father, the lord of that land, gives him his family's ancestral sword, but Alveric is like "hmm, this ain't gonna do shit against them elves and their magic fuckery, I bet", so he goes to see a local witch and asks her to make him a magic sword
[02:23:50] <Obormot\Gaia> She agrees, and has him gather meteorites (!) that have fallen to the ground in some recent meteor showers, then does some magic and basically enchants the sword with the all the essence of human lands and human values
[02:24:04] <gwern> damn, we need that sword more than he does
[02:24:05] <Obormot\Gaia> (The better to act as proof against faerie bullshit)

[02:25:25] *** Joins: galambo__ (galambo@user/galambo)
[02:25:49] <Obormot\Gaia> Dunsany then makes a specific point of noting how basically nobody can explain how this sword is made and why it's so awesome, because anyone who knows enough about science to know wtf meteorites are and how they came from space and what have you (which is why they're good for making magic swords out of) doesn't know anything about magic, while anyone who knows enough about magic to explain the sorcery involved in the sword's
[02:25:49] <Obormot\Gaia>  creation doesn't know anything about meteorites
[02:26:13] <Obormot\Gaia> (Except this one witch I guess, who is just awesome like that)
[02:27:59] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, Alveric then goes to some local leatherworker and has a scabbard made for his sword (yes! important to consider details like this! can't have your magic sword just hanging out, bumping into shit!), then he takes *both* swords and proceeds to his adventure
[02:29:11] <gwern> both? he *is* prudent

[02:30:33] <gwern> "I am actually left-handed. Because I am ambidextrous."
[02:31:33] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, so he crosses over the border to Elfland, and immediately finds that... everything seems way safer and more welcoming there than in human lands! Why? Well, this deserves a quote:
[02:32:00] <Obormot\Gaia> “There was perhaps less mystery here than on our side of the boundary of twilight; for nothing lurked or seemed to lurk behind great boles of oak, as in certain lights and seasons things may lurk in the fields we know; no strangeness hid on the far side of ridges; nothing haunted deep woods; whatever might possibly lurk was clearly there to be seen, whatever strangeness might be was spread in full sight of the traveller,
[02:32:00] <Obormot\Gaia>  whatever might haunt deep woods lived there in the open day.”
[02:32:26] <Obormot\Gaia> Now that's an unusual take on the "normal world vs. faerie" trope, eh?
[02:33:46] <gwern> faerie world as the england of alternate realities huh
[02:34:29] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyhow, Alveric then proceeds to travel for a bit through an enchanted forest, which is properly scary, because the trees there are all enchanted; the vines try to grab him, the trees literally get up and follow him and try to assault him, etc.
[02:35:57] <Obormot\Gaia> For a while he defends himself with his normal sword, hacking at vines and such, but then he's like "yeah this is not sustainable", takes out his magic sword, and - finds that a single hit from it will instantly disenchant any of the enchanted trees or vines or w/e, cancelling all the faerie magic therein and leaving it an inert regular plant
[02:36:10] <Obormot\Gaia> That was a "humanity fuck yeah" moment right there
[02:36:31] <galambo__> https://nitter.fdn.fr/nntaleb/status/1448691378880454658
[02:36:53] <gwern> how sad. leaving a permanently mundane scar on faerie world
[02:36:56] <feep> that "not twitter" seems broken
[02:37:09] <gwern> humans are the magic-devourers sucking out the color and light from a once beautiful world
[02:37:17] <Obormot\Gaia> “So he went straight ahead, hitting every tree in his way, whether enchanted or not, a blow with his magical sword; and the runes that ran in that metal from the other side of the sun were stronger than any spells that there were in the wood. Great oak trees with sinister boles drooped and lost all their enchantment as Alveric flashed past them with a flick of that magical sword. He was marching faster than the clumsy pines.
[02:37:17] <Obormot\Gaia>  And soon he left in that weird and eerie wood a wake of trees that were wholly unenchanted, that stood there now without hint of romance or mystery even.”
[02:37:37] <gwern> in the end, humanity was the *real* monster
[02:38:20] <Obormot\Gaia> Look, if the elves wanted their shit to not get disenchanted, they should've learned science and made their enchanted arms and so on out of space rocks, like... human... witches...

[02:46:19] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Altogether, we show that careful prompt engineering and a separately trained critic model allow us to selectively distill high-quality causal commonsense from GPT-3, a general language model. Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria:
[02:46:20] <feepbot> quantity, quality, and diversity. In addition, it results in a neural commonsense model that surpasses the teacher model's commonsense capabilities despite its 100x smaller size.

[02:53:04] <gwern> (another woman huh)
[02:54:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, though the two could hardly be more different mental-makeup-wise, from my impression
[02:54:40] <gwern> 'There are even cases of suicide in the Berkeley rationality community associated with scrupulosity and mental self-improvement (specifically, Maia Pasek/​SquirrelInHell, and Jay Winterford/​Fluttershy, both of whom were long-time LessWrong posters; Jay wrote an essay about suicidality, evil, domination, and Roko’s basilisk months before the suicide itself). Both these cases are...
[02:54:46] <gwern> ...associated with a subgroup splitting off of the CFAR-centric rationality community due to its perceived corruption, centered around Ziz. (I also thought CFAR was pretty corrupt at the time, and I also attempted to split off another group when attempts at communication with CFAR failed; I don’t think this judgment was in error, though many of the following actions were; the splinter group...
[02:54:52] <gwern> ...seems to have selected for high scrupulosity and not attenuated its mental impact.)'
[02:55:02] <gwern> ah yes, being a fan of ziz, taylor, that certainly makes me trust your evaluations of anything besides math
[02:56:27] <gwern> 'The cases discussed are not always of MIRI/​CFAR employees, so they’re hard to attribute to the organizations themselves, even if they were clearly in the same or a nearby social circle.' <-- yes, it certainly is hard to attribute, what with stuff like Ziz making people do autohypnotic hallucinations oriented around negative thoughts and moral extremism
[02:57:09] <gwern> (gee, I can't think why that might lead to bad outcomes in people with longstanding psychiatric problems and schizophrenic tendencies)
[02:58:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> "(Yes, I realize how strange it is that I was more able to relate to normal people by occupying an extremely weird mental state where I thought I was destroying the world and was ashamed and suicidal regarding this; such is the state of normal Americans, apparently, in a time when suicidal music is extremely popular among youth.)" ... lol :\
[02:58:35] <gwern> 'I had paranoid fantasies about a MIRI executive assassinating me.

[03:05:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Unless there were psychiatric institutionalizations or jail time resulting from the Leverage psychosis, I infer that Leverage overall handled their metaphysical weirdness better than the MIRI/CFAR adjacent community. While in Leverage the possibility of subtle psychological influence between people was discussed relatively openly, around MIRI/CFAR it was discussed covertly, with people being told they were crazy for believing
[03:05:50] <Obormot\Arcturus>  it might be possible. (I noted at the time that there might be a sense in which different people have “auras” in a way that is not less inherently rigorous than the way in which different people have “charisma”, and I feared this type of comment would cause people to say I was crazy.)" ... lol

English left-wing intellectuals did not, of course, actually want the Germans or Japanese to win the war, but many of them could not help getting a certain kick out of seeing their own country humiliated, and wanted to feel that the final victory would be due to Russia, or perhaps America, and not to Britain. In foreign politics many

[03:50:52] <ggreer> most crashes are drivers doing stupid shit. they fall asleep. they get drunk. they look at their phones. they get angry or frustrated. etc. my guess is that current FSD would have more crashes per distance than humans, but they'll all be clustered in the weird 1% of intersections, construction zones, and whatnot

[03:52:14] <gwern> no, that's just teslas

[03:53:39] <ggreer> I assume that happens to lots of cars with TACC, but tesla gets in trouble because they shipped an update that tries to fix the issue
[03:54:02] <gwern> nm, I thought that was supposed to be a human error
[03:55:35] <ggreer> new tech gets so much extra scrutiny. everyone has been freaking out about EV fires, but nobody remembers stuff like a million BMWs getting recalled for bursting into flames while parked: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bmw-recalls-1-million-vehicles-over-fire-risk-recommends-parking-n817511

[03:56:07] <quanticle> Yeah, or all the unexpected acceleration incidents with e.g. Toyota or Audi
[03:56:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Though "retaliation" isn't quite right, I think. It seems like the effect of reading this is going to be (perhaps... is meant to be? not sure on this one) that people say "well... actually none of this sounds... all that bad? but then... maybe Leverage wasn't that bad??"
[03:57:01] <quanticle> I think the intended effect is to say that the problem isn't with Leverage, the problem is with rationalists.

[03:57:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: In fact, if it weren't Jessica writing about herself, I'd add that there's also the secondary message of "maybe the people who had/have problems are just crazy, like this person clearly is/was"
[03:57:39] <ggreer> yeah. tesla has a lot more info about what goes on in the car so they can show that a lot of "unintended acceleration" stuff is just people mixing up pedals: https://twitter.com/Umbisam/status/1447523331025031169

[03:58:09] <ggreer> tesla does have software to try and detect when people push the wrong pedal, but it's not 100% accurate. it has saved some lives (and some cars) so far
[03:59:13] <ggreer> nissan and toyota have it too. it's called Pedal Misapplication Mitigation
[04:00:34] <quanticle> The Audi unintended acceleration was pretty conclusively proven to be people mixing up pedals. As I understand it, when Audi brought their A100 to the United States, they didn't move the pedals over to where people in the US expected them to be, so people ended up missing the brake and hitting the accelerator. This was in the '80s; not really any way for Audi to do pedal misapplication
[04:00:36] <quanticle> mitigation with then.
[04:03:08] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah
[04:08:09] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Historical sources are unequivocal that Polynesians, like most of the Indians of America north of Mexico, were without alcoholic beverages in their pristine state. Liquor was first brought to Polynesians by European voyagers in the middle and late 18th century. While the original reaction to liquor was one of distaste, this soon changed to avid liking, and a lively trade
[04:08:09] <feepbot> grew up in many areas. Around 1800, escaped convicts from Botany Bay in Australia taught Hawaiians how to distill a highly potable liquor, okole hao, from the fructose sugars of the ti root.

[07:07:59] <feepbot> An underground rocket or rocket drill is a device for rapidly drilling holes through soil and rock of varying composition at rates up to 1 metre per second by utilising supersonic jets of hot gases. It was developed by Russian engineer Mikhail Tsiferov in 1948.
[07:09:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I recently overheard someone (who I’d not met before) _telling_ Eliezer Yudkowsky that he’s not allowed to have extreme beliefs about AGI outcomes. I don’t recall the specific claim, just that EY’s probability mass for the claim was in the 95-99% range. The person argued that because EY disagrees with some other thoughtful people on that question, he shouldn’t have such confidence.
[07:09:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (At the time, I noticed I didn’t have to be around or listen to that person and just wandered away. Poor Eliezer stayed and tried to give a thoughtful explanation for why the argument seemed bad.)"
[07:10:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Come to bed." "I can't. This is important." "What?" "Someone is *wrong about AGI*." —Eliezer, probably
[07:10:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (but yes, lol @ the dude arguing with EY in that anecdote)
[07:10:55] <PapuaHardyNet> but... who says "come to bed" to EY
[07:11:50] <PlanckWalk> A counterfactual appropriate-gender version of EY from a timeline in which AGI ate the world?
[07:12:51] <PapuaHardyNet> tfw you travel to alternate timelines without AGI to have sex with yourself
[07:13:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: His girlfriend and/or wife, one must assume...?
[07:13:27] <PapuaHardyNet> oh you mean unfriendly AGI - then it makes sense
[07:13:47] <gwern> (I've disagreed with plenty of thoughtful people at 90%+ confdence and been right. you could probably extract a hundred just from predictionbook alone)
[07:14:13] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I'm not going to speculate on EY's personal life, but I *think* he is/was moderately successful
[07:14:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, being very open about your kinks and desires *usually* signals confidence in satisfying them
[07:14:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure. He had three girlfriends simultaneously at one point, then he got married, now he's divorced... I somehow suspect he hasn't had any trouble finding someone new since then
[07:15:30] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no, he is why polyamory became popular in the rat community
[07:15:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> ">   One point I strongly agree with you on is that rationalists should pay more attention to philosophy.
[07:15:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, I’ve definitely noticed a trend where rationalists are mostly continuing from Hume and Turing, neglecting e.g. Kant as a response to Hume." ... what's to neglect?? Kant is basically unreadable and his ideas are of questionable sense even when you can figure out wtf he's saying...

[09:37:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the Uber example. "Surge pricing", right? Well, in that case it's not that supply gets reduced, and it's not that it becomes harder to provide the good/service...
[09:38:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Supply is the same and costs are the same but demand rises
[09:39:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The desired effect is that people will just continue to deliver and sell items for a reasonable price, as if nothing has happened.
[09:39:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that option was never really on the table." ... well, no. In that case, yes, it absolutely is on the table. They totally *could* continue to deliver the service for the same price as ever. And the same number of people will receive it as they otherwise would. It's just that in that case, it'll get allocated by something other than "who is willing to pay the surge price" (perhaps luck, or something)

[09:47:52] *** Joins: two2thehead (~user@124.195.202.105)
[09:53:32] <nshepperd2> the point of surge pricing is to increase the supply
[09:53:46] <nshepperd2> to higher than usual
[09:54:50] <saturn2> iirc people looked into it and drivers were unable to predict surge pricing or move to surge areas fast enough to take much advantage. it was just a windfall for drivers who happened to be there and for uber itself
[09:55:21] <nshepperd2> that's unfortunate
[09:56:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, my impression mirrors saturn2's, but also, there are other examples... cases where supply is inherently limited, largely or entirely
[09:58:56] <nshepperd2> also 'They totally *could* continue to deliver the service for the same price as ever'  is not quite true
[10:00:06] <nshepperd2> they could deliver a similar service, but where most people who try to order a taxi have to wait a lot longer for one to be allocated
[10:00:30] <nshepperd2> instead of the usual service where you get a taxi within a minute
[10:00:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, yeah
[10:01:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still, it's a materially different situation
[10:04:05] *** Joins: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[10:04:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> But really even in general...
[10:04:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If you _successfully_ prevent people from selling toilet paper at $100 a roll (rather than simply driving the transactions underground into a black market), the actual effect is usually that there’s no one selling toilet paper at all."
[10:05:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the scenario here is that there's a natural disaster and a sudden TP shortage, perhaps because of supply chain disruption, or sudden impact on distribution logistics, etc.
[10:06:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, in that case if the store has 1000 rolls of TP, they can either sell it at $100 a roll, or they can sell it at, let's say the usual price is, $1 a roll, right
[10:06:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But... in either case, 1000 people each get a roll of TP?
[10:06:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then there will be no one selling TP
[10:07:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> The store having made a windfall of $100k on that 1k rolls doesn't ... somehow change that, it doesn't materialize additional TP from nowhere
[10:07:41] <saturn2> the theory is that entrepreneurs will hire trucks to bring more TP in order to sell it for $100
[10:07:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems unrealistic
[10:08:02] <saturn2> yes
[10:08:47] *** Quits: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[10:08:57] <nshepperd2> actually it does, bc if the store anticipated supply chain disruption it would have purchased extra TP prior to the disruption specifically in order to sell it for $100 a roll
[10:09:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> If the store anticipated supply chain disruption then so would've everyone else, and then TP wouldn't be selling for $100 a roll because all the stores would have lots of it stocked up
[10:09:54] <nshepperd2> also the truck thing, which i think actually happened in hurricane wossname but the guys got sent home and nobody got what they were selling
[10:10:24] <nshepperd2> nah, lots of people don't anticipate supply chain disruption
[10:13:38] <nshepperd2> and there's no motivation to stock up if you know for sure you'll only be able to sell it for the usual price bc higher is illegal, so in reality everyone would have anticipated supply chain disruption, and then nobody would have stocked up, and everyone would be all "oh no"
[10:18:20] <PlanckWalk> Really it seems that most of the benefit of "surge pricing"/"price gouging" is a modest signal toward preparing for future supply/demand shocks.
[10:18:44] <PlanckWalk> Making the signal much bigger doesn't seem to help much.
[10:19:50] <PlanckWalk> Considering that the usual margin on things like toilet paper is <10%, even a 50% markup is a *huge* signal.

[10:21:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly
[10:22:09] <saturn2> and i belive most of these laws do allow a fairly substantial markup, just not infinite
[10:23:47] <two2thehead> PlanckWalk, do you have a source for that? I'd be interested in improving my general knowledge

[18:42:29] <[itchyjunk]> Does one session of pomodoro still count as pomodoro? Say you do something for 25 minutes and that's that. Or is at least one repetition, stuff; break ; stuff necessary for habit forming?
[18:43:09] <gwern> I do pomodoros all the time. I take a 5 minute break, then when that's over, I take another 5 minute break...
[18:43:33] <[itchyjunk]> Yeah, that's too relatable..
[18:43:49] <gwern> sure, I skip the 25-minute part, but let's not get hung up on the details. other than that, there are very few people who can boast such pomodoro expertise as myself
[18:50:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm a bit less experienced with pomodoros than gwern, but I can tell you some fun stats
[18:51:14] <PapuaHardyNet> so for example, I do 30-5 cadence, and most days I rarely do more than 4 pomodoros (lots of times I do work outside the pomodoros so I'm not wasting my day entirely of course), but some days I hit 8-10 sessions.
[18:51:41] <PapuaHardyNet> and uh, you don't really need to "habit form" - it's just a tool
[18:51:52] <PapuaHardyNet> have a goal, have a timer, go do it
[18:52:18] <PapuaHardyNet> an easier way to do things is to use the 5-5 cadence and scope your goals down to things that you can do in five minutes

[19:01:52] <[itchyjunk]> I am mostly trying to form habits.
[19:02:04] <[itchyjunk]> I never learned how to study so I need a way out.
[19:02:31] <[itchyjunk]> 8 pomodoros sounds nice, 4 hours of solid doing.
[19:03:05] <[itchyjunk]> Supposedly, medical students routinely can squeeze 10 hours or so of study a day.
[19:04:02] <rsaarelm> Medical student studying is sorta grindy memorization though.
[19:04:16] <[itchyjunk]> I didn't know about 5-5 thing
[19:04:51] <rsaarelm> I think there was some article about big-name professional mathematicians and their full workday had around 4 hours of math work and the rest of the day was puttering around.
[19:05:11] <[itchyjunk]> Oh! math is what i'd ideally like to learn
[19:05:37] <[itchyjunk]> Good to know that 10 hours of productive math studying a day is not a realistic possibility.
[19:05:43] <rsaarelm> I had mixed success with pomodoros, turns out mechanical productivity systems don't help much when you don't actually want to do the thing you're trying to force yourself to do.
[19:06:03] <[itchyjunk]> What does help in those cases?
[19:06:23] <rsaarelm> Crashing, burning and quitting the job.
[19:06:51] <gwern> we want what we want, even if we want to want other wants
[19:07:31] <kuudes> have better genes?
[19:07:59] <galambo> pomodoros are a bandaid
[19:08:03] <[itchyjunk]> It's pretty odd. How do you force yourself to do something you don't want? If you're trying to do it, isn't it probably something you want? Who is it that is wanting and who is it that is no wanting?
[19:08:08] <rsaarelm> Coasting by with minimal effort can work if it turns out there aren't actual working systems in place to detect if someone has mentally checked out and is coasting with minimal effort even though you've been encouraged to tell yourself that of course there are, but that probably messes up your head in the long-term.
[19:09:21] <rsaarelm> We go to school for 20 years that drills making ourselves do things we don't want to into us starting from when we're too little to know any better.
[19:09:41] <galambo> [itchyjunk], lots of ink was spilled on procrastination. ultimately, if theres something you dont want to do, try to figure out how not to do it. life is too short to do stuff you dont like.
[19:10:15] <rsaarelm> We're trying to do it because we think we're supposed to. Or are actually supposed to. When things get bad enough, you do work that's horrible or you starve to death.
[19:11:23] <galambo> what worked for me was allocating an hour of my day to whatever the thing is, and then I dont think about it for the rest of the day.
[19:11:39] <galambo> or maybe allocate a certain amount of quantifiable work
[19:11:40] <PapuaHardyNet> pomodoros aren't a bandaid tbf, you can't pomodoro something you don't want to do
[19:11:48] <PapuaHardyNet> they are a focusing aid
[19:11:55] <galambo> like 'read 20 pages'
[19:12:07] <rsaarelm> You can do "either I do the thing or I stare at a wall for this pomodoro"
[19:12:29] <rsaarelm> It works for one pomodoro for me, then I never start the second one.
[19:12:45] <galambo> 'reading 20 pages of a book today' is better than 'I need to read this 500 page book for my exam or whatever so I will start it tomorrow'
[19:13:08] <rsaarelm> But yeah, one good thing with pomodoros is that you need to split things down to something that you can actually do in one sitting.
[19:13:30] <PapuaHardyNet> huh? I don't think that works. Honestly I'd just stare at a wall and daydream
[19:13:30] <rsaarelm> Sorta like the concrete next actions thing that was one thing that stuck with me from the GTD fad from 15 years ago.
[19:13:53] <galambo> also try going to the library or join an online pomodoro room. having company who are also working makes you feel incentivised
[19:13:55] <PapuaHardyNet> rsaarelm: exactly: when I use pomodoros, I have a specific scoped objective in mind
[19:15:02] <galambo> the biggest problem with productivity is social media. if you find yourself procrastinating by scrolling through twitter or facebook then you also need to address that
[19:15:46] <[itchyjunk]> I got rid of almost all social media long time ago. Only thing use now is irc
[19:19:49] <rsaarelm> I think maybe one meta-approach is going for persistence instead of excellence.
[19:20:21] <galambo> irc is the worst social media
[19:20:36] <rsaarelm> Like, instead of trying to turn your shitty distracted approach to stuff into something great right away, just try to go at the stuff every day, even if you do that shittily at start.

[19:52:41] <[itchyjunk]> That's kinda how I saw it too, hence the doubts
[19:54:09] <rsaarelm> Was about to say I don't actually know grad school people, but then I remembered one guy I do know who was in one last year, took a short vacation, realized he had been so fucked up with stress he'd gotten numb to how bad it was during the vacation and promptly dropped out.

[19:55:41] <rsaarelm> Like, there maybe used to be some kind of general "be an university person" life path, but I think that's going away, and now you want to have some kind of more purposeful plan about the grad school, like "I want a PhD in *thing* so I can do *such-and-such* specific thing with it"

[19:57:21] <rsaarelm> In other direction, if you do have a thing you want to do, think about whether a PhD will help with that.
[19:58:17] <rsaarelm> I don't know, it's confusing all around, but it also feels like there's a lot more opportunities now to get mixed up in all sorts of interesting stuff without being in academia.
[19:59:21] <[itchyjunk]> I don't necessarily want to be in academia, but it's this weird attraction to the idea of learning. Vague desire to want to learn everything then get frustrated because i never end up learning anything significant.
[19:59:49] <rsaarelm> So what kind of thing would feel like learning something significant to you?

[20:36:38] <gwern> have you considered working from a tutorial that's not almost older than you are? like nielsen's or karpathy's python backprop or jax tutorials
[20:37:21] * gwern goes back to writing about "What is it like to be a cat (tail)?"
[20:37:45] <feep> <gwern> I've just published my first book: "The Complete Cat (Volume 1)"

[20:38:53] <feep> not structure and interpretation?
[20:39:07] <gwern> the typography of sicp is nothing to write home about
[20:39:25] <feep> Michael Abrash's Black Book with White Paws
[20:39:35] <[itchyjunk]> gwern, i never considered that it was the tutorial that was bad. i'll try karpathy's tutorial!
[20:40:44] <PapuaHardyNet> when gwern is 60, he'll finally consider gwern.net "tentatively complete"
[20:40:48] <RiversHaveWings> what tutorial was it?
[20:41:07] <PapuaHardyNet> just the site codebase, I mean, not the content
[20:42:22] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: it must be bad. that is the only interpretation I have, because otherwise you would simply modify its given implementation one function at a time, comparing all inputs and outputs and computed gradients, until you understood what you got wrong

[21:09:37] <feep> Then again.
[21:09:51] <feep> As a bonus, population starts rising again, turns out we were all just too out of shape to be hot
[21:10:13] <feep> fuck, now I want to live in this universe
[21:10:31] <vrs> what's this ai box game, is it just a form of nomic?
[21:10:36] <feep> um, backstory
[21:10:53] <feep> this involves actors and positions that are so stupid you may not believe them to be real, but I assure you they are
[21:11:25] <feep> okay so around the time this happened, there was *genuinely* a widespread impression, that you could build a superintelligence, and in order to prevent it from being dangerous, you'd just limit your interaction with it to a text mode interface
[21:11:30] <feep> ie. "box" it
[21:11:58] <feep> the metaphor is you put the AI in a box and only interact with the box through a limited-bandwidth interface
[21:12:04] <feep> eliezer thought this was stupid as fuck.
[21:12:16] <vrs> seems trivial to win by just refusing communication, so where's the catch?
[21:12:24] <feep> no you *want* to communicate
[21:12:32] <feep> you wanna like, do things like ask the ai for cancer cures
[21:12:45] <feep> you just maybe don't trust it to access the internet unrestricted
[21:12:47] * gwern notes that the OA API is an AI-in-a-box and has a lot of commercial demand
[21:12:57] <feep> anyway, eliezer said, "you're worried about the ai hacking a net link, but think the human brain is *safe from hacking*??"
[21:13:23] <feep> "the ai could definitely hack your brain. Look, uh. I don't like to brag, but *I* could hack your brain, and if I could do it, the AI definitely could"
[21:13:31] <feep> "bullshit you can hack my brain", some people said.
[21:13:33] <feep> so there was a bet.
[21:13:59] <vrs> ok so the challenge is getting a cancer cure out of the ai (as played by yud) without letting it out in some form? and this presumably includes the ai trojaning itself as part of the cure?
[21:14:01] <feep> and, uh, it turns out putting yourself in the mindset to break through another person's attempts to restrict you is actually really psychologically harmful to yourself, so eliezer stopped doing it after a bit
[21:14:12] <feep> vrs: nono, the goal is to make the human type "I let the AI out."
[21:14:18] <feep> straight up full consent.
[21:14:27] <feep> and eliezer *did this.* repeatedly.
[21:15:13] <feep> and we don't know how, because the transcripts were never released, but eliezer said he did it "fairly", ie. no gotcha solutions, no offering the experimenter $1000 irl
[21:15:23] <feep> and the counterplayers never contradicted him
[21:15:46] <feep> my personal theory is that the transcripts are unreleased because to *really* do this, you have to basically behave like a psychopath
[21:16:06] <feep> full-on emotional manipulation over the full hour of play.
[21:16:23] <feep> and that's just not a good look :p
[21:16:27] <feep> but it worked tho.
[21:16:32] <vrs> man I wanna play that
[21:16:40] <feep> yeah um
[21:16:43] <feep> how do I put this
[21:16:51] <vrs> can be just build an AI that does nothing but try to escape and put it on steam or so
[21:16:54] <feep> people who *seriously* play this have a tendency of either being, or going, a bit loopy.
[21:17:45] <feep> "let's conceptualize this human being I am talking to as a system that I have to manipulate into the goal state of performing a designated action" is probably not a healthy mindstate.
[21:17:59] <vrs> I get that but I wanna play as defender
[21:18:03] <feep> sure, everyone does
[21:18:08] <vrs> well playing as AI also sounds fun
[21:18:15] <feep> sadly, nobody who thinks they can win as attacker wants to play it anymore
[21:18:24] <feep> I think it's for the best.

[21:21:07] <mst> feep: friend of mine's getting annoyed playing villagers now cos they're better at being believed when they're just manipulating people into destrying themselves than when they're telling the truth
[21:21:13] <vrs> is there a level of play where experienced attackers play each other
[21:22:02] <vrs> putting yud as defender against some other grandmaster-level player or so
[21:22:21] <vrs> or does it lose on replay and you can't really do that because that's making it an iterated game
[21:24:21] <mst> we don't know, because people found it sufficiently exhausting I don't think people tended to play more than once, and the transcripts were kept private
[21:25:23] <gwern> I think repeated AI boxes would be bad because the point is that a single escape is irrevocable, and after enough times, even a gullible human will figure out how to imitate a 4yo child: "no. no. no. no." for an hour
[21:26:01] <gwern> unfortunately, 'permitting repeated escapes on a single immortal gatekeeper' is not a viable boxing strategy
[21:26:11] <PapuaHardyNet> if you put a 4 year old child in a box, and convince the human that the box contains an AI that wants to get out...
[21:26:56] <rmmh> ai box: convince a human that there's a 4 year old locked in the box
[21:27:12] <gwern> repeated werewolf games or even rock-paper-scissors are fine because there's actually ways to win without the consent of the gatekeeper. but removing all of those and considering the absolute purest and easiest gatekeeper win is the point
[21:27:48] <rmmh> the key mistake is running werewolf over multiple days
[21:28:12] <rmmh> any social manipulation game run over a long period of time is toxic

[23:34:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, that's true of SO many people though
[23:35:12] <rsaarelm> Hegel has some remarkably bizarre paragraphs that are his attempts to define electricity and heat, but even philosophers seem to have just quietly stopped expecting Hegel's original writings to make any sense.
[23:35:38] <gwern> that sort of dialectical evolution of hegel interpretation merely proves him right

[23:36:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Totally, he just got confused when he tried thinking about a lot of stuff

[23:41:29] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: it's basically the lw simple idea of truth post, kant is trying to lay out an operational model of a mind
[23:41:41] <feep> and justifying why minds work
[23:42:14] <feep> but he goes wrong immediately because he assumes that the operation of the mind happens in consciousness.
[23:42:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well ok
[23:42:35] <feep> ie. for instance, there's an operation where like, you experience lots of cases of three things
[23:42:42] <feep> and then eventually you synthesize this into the concept "three"
[23:42:55] <feep> but to do this you invoke a synthesis concept, which needs to preexist somehow

[23:43:17] <feep> this is an understandable mistake: kant did not know about reinforcement learning :p
[23:43:24] <feep> rsaarelm: no idea, link?
[23:43:55] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: anyway, everything that goes wrong in this post, and I presume, kant's theory, derives from the idea that concepts must exist *before* a mental operation can take place.
[23:44:06] <rsaarelm> feep: I'll try to find it...
[23:44:22] <feep> so self must exist before unification because experiences are fundamentally experienced by a self
[23:44:35] <feep> again, you note, mixing up "a person" and "the self-perception of the person"
[23:45:07] <feep> because kant doesn't have a separation of like, introspection and the actual mechanism being introspected on.
[23:45:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Yeah I guess. It's a pretty weird mistake to make, honestly. I don't think it would ever have occurred to me to think something like "in order to notice that three apples and three breadsticks are both, like, 'three things', I first have to have a concept of 'synthesis'"
[23:45:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's just a super bizarre leap and I cannot see where it could come from
[23:45:23] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: it is! but it makes sense cause kant was probably really, really introspective
[23:45:39] <feep> and like, to the extent that every time he noticed himself synthesizing something, he thought of the concept as well
[23:45:48] <feep> so post hoc ergo propter hoc, the concept was the thing doing the synthesis
[23:45:58] <feep> 60% of what goes wrong in philosophy is this error, imo
[23:46:21] *** Quits: srhm (~srhm@user/srhm) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:46:33] <feep> well, that number is really pulled out my arse, so I'll retract it and just say I see it a lot.
[23:46:59] *** Joins: srhm (~srhm@user/srhm)
[23:47:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "60%", "a lot", "at least once", "eh it doesn't seem obviously impossible" ... same deal, amirite

[23:47:21] <feep> same order of magnitude, which is to say, 0..1
[23:47:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems legit

[23:48:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Google Translate says:
[23:48:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Electricity is the pure purpose of the figure that frees itself from it; the shape that begins to undo its indifference, for electricity is the immediate emergence or the existence not yet coming from the shape or conditioned by it, or not yet the dissolution of the shape itself, but the superficial process in which the differences take their shape leave, but have them on their condition and are not yet independent at them.
[23:48:12] <Obormot\Arcturus>  "
[23:48:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's truly amazing that someone could write something like this and feel like they've accomplished anything or done any kind of useful intellectual work
[23:48:59] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: and also, I mean, kant didn't know about reinforcement learning, so
[23:49:19] <feep> like, nowadays I can grab gpt-2 and just say "look, synthesis happening without any concept of synthesis!"
[23:49:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Most people don't know about reinforcement learning but I think that Kant's take on this is obviously nonsense regardless
[23:49:38] <feep> sadly, this excellent knockdown argument was not available at the time.
[23:49:45] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: right, but like
[23:50:10] <gwern> 'hegel, gpt-2 hegal, or machine translation hegel?'
[23:50:12] <feep> you can either disprove it by having a more convincing theory of the operation of the mind, or you can grab a publically available counterexample.
[23:50:23] <feep> we live in a time of plenty <32

[23:53:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But let us never forget, either, as _all conventional history of philosophy conspires to make us forget_, what the ‘great thinkers’ _really_ are: proper objects, indeed, of pity, but even more, of horror. "
[23:54:00] <gwern> stoves?
[23:54:18] <feep> now there's a proper object
[23:54:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Stove, yeah
[23:57:01] <feep> hee. my code failed to compile on pass 2 cause I unintentionally fixed an error
