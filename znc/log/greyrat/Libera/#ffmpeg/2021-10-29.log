[10:50:11] <furq> there is an -lhls option but it only exists in the dash muxer for some reason
[10:50:55] <furq> you can create both hls and dash at once with the dash muxer, so it makes some sense, but idk why it's not also available in the hls muxer
[10:51:18] <furq> also it has all the caveats mentioned in that patch
[10:54:28] <youmustrust> Thanks for help! =) At this moment, Apple's LLHLS document is available, so it got me wonder if ffmpeg can support it.

[10:57:12] <aphysically> low latency hls was implemented by the community before apple did it, so there's competing namespace and implementations

[10:57:36] <AMM> Yeah I looked at hlsjs just now and saw them deprecating lhls because apple llhls was created

[13:14:10] <bartzy> found it - brew install l-smash
[13:16:35] *** Joins: af (~af@awalgarg.me)
[13:17:28] <JEEB> usually it's either within track definition or movie
[13:18:11] <JEEB> technically trak boxes are within moov as well, but I hope you undertand ;)
[13:19:06] <bartzy> so it's a mov. I have a good version (i.e. correct resolution 1170x2532). I then pass it through my own custom tool that uses AVFoundation on Mac to add some metadata to the video. But it writes the video as is, no transcoding.
[13:19:40] <JEEB> well if you have remuxed it, then you can diff the boxdumper outputs?
[13:19:47] <JEEB> before and after
[13:19:54] <JEEB> and hopefully the structure is not too different
[13:20:14] <bartzy> I see that the "good" version has 1170 as width everywhere in the `boxdumper --box` output. The bad version (after my tool) has width = 1169.919678 in `[tkhd: Track Header Box]`, `[clef: Track Clean Aperture Dimensions Box]`, `[prof: Track Production Aperture Dimensions Box]`
[13:20:56] <bartzy> not sure what does this mean? some aspect ratio wonkiness in AVFoundation when creating the mov container?
[13:20:57] <JEEB> fun
[13:21:51] <JEEB> well, clearly it calculated something somewhere :)
[13:21:54] <bartzy> :)
[13:21:58] <galad> is the par 1:1?
[13:22:18] <bartzy> can this be bad somehow on playback?
[13:22:45] <galad> unless you play it back at the actual size, no
[13:23:30] <bartzy> galad: ffprobe output of both bad and good videos: `SAR 14559:14560 DAR 207:448`. is SAR == PAR?
[13:23:48] <bartzy> that 14559 vs 14560 looks very suspicious :D
[13:24:04] <galad> yup, avfoundation is recalculating the width using that
[13:24:15] <bartzy> eh.. why?
[13:24:16] <galad> set SAR to 1:1
[13:24:35] <bartzy> why it's not just the width and height and that's it. non-square-pixel craziness?
[13:24:38] <galad> because the width in tkhd is calculated using that
[13:26:03] <bartzy> so it's just the `setsar=1:1` filter at the end of my filterchain? Doesn't matter if I'm using scale or zscale?
[13:26:08] <galad> and because the past happened, like it or not
[13:30:35] <bartzy> should I just setsar=1:1 or also -aspect_ratio or something?

[15:24:46] <bartzy> JEEB: So nothing wrong with explicitly setting SAR to setsar=1 ?
[15:27:06] <bartzy> I think I know why it's happening in some of my videos. most videos come from PNG sequences in 1284x2778. Some of them ("broken" ones) are coming from PNG sequences in 1242x2688 and upscaled by ffmpeg to 1284x2778, and also downscaled to 1170x2532 as a x265 video. there are very slight aspect ratio differences between these resolutions
[15:28:49] <JEEB> yup
[15:29:02] <JEEB> basically if you know the math is gonna be more or less 1:1
[15:29:08] <JEEB> then just setsar to 1:1 is OK
[15:29:40] <bartzy> so what happens exactly when I do that? zscale (or however I'm actually scaling) is scaling the input to the size I gave it, but the SAR is still computed from the input based on the output size?
[15:29:58] <bartzy> like, why is it not 1:1 exactly. Just trying to understand the semantics here of what's happenning

[15:36:58] <JEEB> they are not exactly 16:9

[22:40:15] <c_14> are you building for windows? If so any reason you're not using schannel?
[22:40:42] <CarlWain74> I'm not familiar with schannel
[22:41:06] <c_14> windows' internal ssl library

[22:42:00] <c_14> does /c/Argus-OpenSSL/Argus/build/openssl/gen/lib/ssl.lib exist?
[22:42:23] <CarlWain74> yes
[22:42:59] <CarlWain74> We copy libssl.lib to ssl.lib
[22:43:37] <CarlWain74> same for libcrypto.lib
[22:43:42] <c_14> >LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'ssl.lib'
[22:44:04] <c_14> it looks like that's the root of the issue, but I don't know enough about windows to debug that
[22:44:15] <c_14> other than recommending to try schannel instead
[22:44:53] <CarlWain74> Oddly enough on a different machine I got it working, but that EC2 instance was terminated
[22:46:14] <CarlWain74> Hopefully someone else on this channel might have more experience
[22:46:20] <CarlWain74> Thanks anyway
