[14:16:15] <ERROH> i just had a talk with manager about that, and i kinda prefer the merican system
[14:16:42] <ERROH> i mean the merican system is best for priviledged while it fucks over the poor
[14:17:26] <jotham> money gets money
[14:17:30] <jotham> it's expensive being poor
[14:17:32] <jotham> even here in nz
[14:17:41] <jotham> so much shit costs more being poor here
[14:18:11] <jotham> citation needed: i'm fucking bankrupt for 60 more days
[14:18:47] * jotham fizzes from every hole, even the tear ducts
[14:20:39] <ERROH> what changes in 60 days
[14:21:09] <jotham> new tax number, new identity, new man, can earn what i like, and be a sole trader (self employed) again if i want
[14:21:34] <jotham> and the government doesn't take half of everything i earn + tax each month
[14:21:49] <ERROH> ahh, didn't know there's a time limit on stuff like that
[14:21:54] <jotham> i'm getting like 1/3 of what i earn at the moment
[14:22:33] <jotham> not really a time limit, more like, when i entered bankruptcy we 'negotiated' (they told me) i had to pay off x thousands within 3 years
[14:22:46] <ERROH> i'm hoping to get into the biggest debt of my life in like 60 days, but i'm gonna die so not so afraid
[14:22:49] <jotham> like a settlement
[14:22:59] <jotham> r u buying a flower shop
[14:23:21] <ERROH> and you're gonna pay off in those 2 months?  are the they teh mob?
[14:23:24] <ERROH> a house
[14:23:37] <jotham> well i've been bankrupt almost 4 years
[14:23:42] <jotham> so yeah the money is almost paid off
[14:24:28] <jotham> right now i've been struggling to rent a house
[14:24:36] <jotham> and can't even change cellphone companies
[14:24:44] <jotham> so it'll be good when the boot is off my neck
[14:24:47] <ERROH> heard it's hard for exconvicts 
[14:24:59] <jotham> where is the house
[14:25:12] <ERROH> in the middle of nowhere
[14:25:19] <jotham> do you remote work
[14:25:22] <ERROH> hilly place
[14:25:24] <ERROH> sure
[14:25:27] <jotham> we have fiber so many random arse remote places in nz
[14:25:37] <jotham> i don't get why more people don't get out of the cities
[14:25:39] <ERROH> that place doesn't have fiber
[14:25:44] <jotham> yuppy technical workers like us
[14:25:47] <ERROH> i will learn to hate lte for at least a year
[14:26:04] <jotham> and starlink sounds dumb expensive and super laggy atm
[14:26:13] <Renderwww> no doctors in the middle of nowhere, no super markets in the middle of nowhere
[14:26:23] <Renderwww> you basically need a car in the middle of nowhere
[14:27:07] <ERROH> sure
[14:27:18] <ERROH> i have a car now too
[14:27:31] <ERROH> our doctors suck regardless of location
[14:27:39] <ERROH> public transport is abysmal
[14:27:47] <jotham> sure you def need a car
[14:27:52] <jotham> but 1 hour drive to a doctor is fine
[14:27:53] <ERROH> so might as well enjoy the peace 
[14:28:00] <jotham> how often do you go to a fucking doctor
[14:28:12] <jotham> our largest two cities take over an hour to even traverse them because of traffic
[14:28:45] <ERROH> i'm touring our city parks with the dog since wife'u's sick
[14:28:54] <ERROH> the traffic is terribad
[14:28:55] <jotham> i want a dog so bad
[14:28:57] <Renderwww> it's more of a concern in the long run when you get older
[14:29:17] <Renderwww> and if you have kids schools could be far away
[14:29:23] <ERROH> but for some reason i want the bitch to experience and learn public transport
[14:29:27] <jotham> Renderwww: i live in a socialist country, my dad literally gets visited by a nurse once a month as a community support officer
[14:29:31] <jotham> it's pretty good tbh
[14:29:43] <jotham> he lives in the middle of fucking nowhere
[14:30:09] <ERROH> your biopic is gonna star ricky gervais
[14:30:14] <jotham> haha
[14:30:19] <jotham> no way
[14:30:56] <ERROH> (he's gonna play the father)
[14:31:21] <jotham> it'd be the guy that plays gordon brown in in the thick of it
[14:32:07] <ERROH> i want to be played by berstershimtd cunterstein, but he'd have to grow a beard for teh role
[14:32:33] <jotham> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4AoSBqY_GI
[14:32:42] <ERROH> haven't seen that show
[14:32:51] <jotham> i think it's very funny
[14:33:02] <jotham> seen it maybe 3 times, along with yes minister
[14:34:02] <ERROH> would probably want to watch it alone, lady doesn't get the bonghumour
[14:34:03] <jotham> armando iannucci is a very funny prick
[14:34:13] <jotham> oh yeah it's extremely britbong
[14:34:20] <jotham> the jokes don't really have punchlines
[14:34:23] <ERROH> and i already want to northern exposure
[14:34:23] <jotham> it's the setup that is the joke
[14:34:40] <ERROH> i'm in the stage of revisiting the good old days
[14:34:43] <jotham> that's why i struggle with american comedy
[14:35:01] <ERROH> i'm playing gta:sa, watching northern exposure and st:voy
[14:35:02] <jotham> i've grown up thinking the setup, the irony of the situation so to speak, is the gag
[14:35:08] <jotham> not the actual end of it
[14:35:19] <ERROH> i don't analyse any of that
[14:35:23] <jotham> i haven't seen northern exposure for years
[14:35:30] <jotham> does it hold up
[14:35:34] <jotham> i could be keen to give it a go
[14:35:39] <ERROH> i either enjoy shit or i give up
[14:35:48] <ERROH> i find it boring as hell :D
[14:35:54] <jotham> okay
[14:35:56] <ERROH> that's 90s speed for you
[14:36:06] <ERROH> well, i've watched like 2 episodes
[14:36:28] <jotham> i still listen to the SA radio stations
[14:36:31] <jotham> on mp3
[14:36:33] <ERROH> truth be told, i probably only watched it because my hormones wanted to bang the pixie girl
[14:36:48] <ERROH> VC had better radios
[14:37:37] <jotham> oh fuck yeah sorry VC is what i'm thinking- fever 105?
[14:37:42] <ERROH> i was laughing about geolocation the other year
[14:37:48] <jotham> introduced me to ETHNIC MUSIC i wasn't naturally aligned with
[14:37:53] <jotham> it wasn't exactly iron maiden 
[14:38:01] <ERROH> because i remember the progression of songs on one of those radios
[14:38:16] <ERROH> and was expecting critet theme after some song
[14:38:31] <ERROH> becuase i had it burned into my brain that it comes after some other song
[14:38:44] <ERROH> but deezer played next one for some reason
[14:38:59] <ERROH> turns out it's not available in my country due to licensing
[14:39:29] <jotham> nz copied australian licensing / censorship law for decades
[14:39:36] <jotham> cause it was cheaper than doing it ourselves
[14:39:43] <jotham> but it turns out they are way more christian than we are
[14:39:49] <jotham> we only unwound it in the last 20 years
[14:40:06] <ERROH> christ copywrited the bible?
[14:40:19] <jotham> i love the idea that laws could just be a matter of cost effectiveness
[14:40:24] <jotham> not something anyone agrees with
[15:00:07] <ERROH> i don't even understand that
[15:01:38] <jotham> well it's the long term reality right
[15:01:47] <jotham> thanks to software and big data and all these other ml related wanks
[15:02:08] <jotham> governments will just shop around for a decision making algorithm or precooked policy
[15:02:22] <jotham> cause the public is demanding something on some issue
[15:02:32] <jotham> rather than doing any policymaking themselves
[15:02:40] <jotham> we already have it with our social welfare system here in nz
[15:02:53] <jotham> algorithm says no or yes to a solo mother with her 3 kids struggling to survive
[15:03:05] <jotham> and the case manager can't really debate it because it's literally algorithm says no or yes
[15:03:14] <jotham> and algorithm is both ml and also a trade secret
[15:06:46] <bjank_> I need more sleep if I'm going to be this sad.
[15:10:42] <ERROH> you would need to live in shithole for a couple of years to realise it will never happen here
[15:10:54] <ERROH> that sounded very carboni of you ham
[15:12:25] <jotham> oh sorry ERROH 
[15:12:29] <jotham> i mean i'm open to ideas
[15:12:38] <jotham> it's literally happening here with social welfare
[15:12:46] <jotham> and like i said, already happened with censorship
[15:12:53] <jotham> not just flights of fancy
[15:13:15] <jotham> and in the states there are already reports of ml being used to thin out court cases
[15:13:47] <jotham> but yeah open to ideas on it, definitely not like some fantasy i am deeply connected to
[15:14:32] <ERROH> when you said laws i thought you were talking literal laws being made that way
[15:14:42] <ERROH> like an extension to democratic process
[15:15:26] <jotham> well in the case of our censorship laws, yes definitely
[15:15:36] <jotham> completely cherry picked from au and uk
[15:15:40] <ERROH> i'm listening to stuff like commity meetings and i don't see that happening ever
[15:15:47] <jotham> but in terms of things like social welfare, it's a bit more ambiguous
[15:16:16] <ERROH> i don't know
[15:16:22] <ERROH> i'd better just be sad then
[15:17:30] <jotham> you guys luckily have the catholic church
[15:17:32] <jotham> hehe
[15:17:44] <jotham> there might be some human values rather than just cost cutting
