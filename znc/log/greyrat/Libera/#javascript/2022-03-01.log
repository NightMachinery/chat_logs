[00:05:33] <mikrosis> hax: ah, so I could also use `array.map` to emulate a `for` loop? e.g. 8 times
[00:07:01] <stenno> Array.from({ length: 8 }, (_,index) => <Thing ...
[00:07:05] <stenno> or
[00:07:09] <mikrosis> cool
[00:07:18] <stenno> [...Array(8)].map(...)
[00:07:35] <ljharb> mikrosis: not to emulate a loop. loops are bad and you don't want those. you use .map to transform one array to another, and react can just render the new array
[00:07:41] <ljharb> definitely never use Array()

[03:01:21] <mikrosis> ljharb, austincheney: It is a HTTP REST API. It should run primarily in the browser. But fetch would still be too new? Should I use axios?
[03:01:59] <ljharb> mikrosis: fetch is great in the browser. as for "too new" that depends on what browsers you want to support.
[03:02:05] <ljharb> i'd use axios if you want to not have to care.
[03:02:34] <austincheney> z1haze, I have never heard of RAML before https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAML_(software)
[03:03:38] <z1haze> at least i am not alone
[03:03:43] <ljharb> nope, never heard of it
[03:04:37] <austincheney> z1haze, I define all my service APIs as TypeScript interfaces and then I wrap them in an outer object, like {"data":theAPI, "service":"name of service"} and then I can manage all my service traffic using a single end point both at the server and in the browser

[03:08:18] <austincheney> most everybody uses REST to expose service APIs, which typically indicates they are falling in on existing architecture and have never questioned the cost/benefits of REST
[03:09:29] <z1haze> i dont think this tooling and REST are mutually exclusive
[03:10:29] <z1haze> unless you are referring to the typical /resources to get all, /resources/{id} to get one, post the /resources to create, etc
[03:11:20] *** Joins: silverdust (~silverdus@user/silverdust)
[03:11:22] <austincheney> z1haze, I strongly suggest not using REST unless you have well thought out reason for doing so, like directly exposing service APIs to the end user: MusicStore.com/alternative/90s/SoundGarden/SuperUnknown

[03:12:59] <mikrosis> I want to use React.Suspend with the same query on two parts of a page (ionic tab)
[03:13:03] <z1haze> ive literally been using rest my entire career, so while i appreciate your input, i will continue to use rest
[03:13:25] <mikrosis> the breadcrumb trail and the page contents both use a skeleton while React.Suspend waits for react-query to fetch the data
[03:14:00] <mikrosis> the thing is that both components, the breadcrumb trail and the page contents need the same query... How can I unify this? I read that react-query will automatically handle all the caching stuff for me

[05:51:37] <theskillwithin> ya because your using it as a string not an element
[05:51:56] <theskillwithin> you could try doing dangerouslySetInnerHTML to hack around it

[08:04:15] <Maxdamantus> imo it's generally an undesirable thing to do anyway. If you use the "authorization_code" flow, you shouldn't be getting a JWT from the client.

[08:08:11] <Maxdamantus> You should probably just use a session cookie corresponding to a session in the database.
[08:08:20] <Maxdamantus> When the user wants to log out, you delete the session from the database.

[10:20:25] <ljharb> theskillwithin: lol what? no new countries?
[10:20:26] <banana_> they better not
[10:20:31] <ljharb> theskillwithin: the goal of anything like nato is for *every single country* to join it
[10:20:34] <ljharb> otherwise what's the point
[10:20:47] <banana_> the US is an empire
[10:20:55] <banana_> i mean global power
[10:20:57] <ljharb> theskillwithin: and how we feel is irrelevant. feelings don't justify military action.

[15:42:43] <DPA> Never had that happen. Pretty sure it should just be 2 clients, and you should have to manage the sessions yourself. Just like with regular websockets, just different connections / clients. Yes, a cookie won't do in this case.

[15:56:37] <DPA> Noone ever needs to mention when async needs to be used. It's obvious. If it returns a promise, or a then-able object, and you care about the result, you need to await it or use the .than function & callback. That's all there is to it.

[15:57:55] <blacked> i thought joining room would seperate those users.

[16:33:43] <blacked> DPA how socket.io knows , that this user is connected, another user connected in the browser.
[16:33:43] <blacked> while in axios, we can just know there is localStorage where i can verify token
[16:34:44] <blacked> But when i try to use verification of socket.io through localStorage, i got into big trouble :(
[16:34:44] <blacked> for eg if i'm not logged in, it just throws error, because socket even though try to connect through localStorage which dont exists anymore.
[16:35:18] <blacked> I wanted to have socket.io authenticated only if user is logged in .
[16:35:23] <blacked> or any way?

[16:39:32] <DPA> I'm not aware of socket.io doing any authentication, but I'm not using it much. I was under the impression, that I can either send to a connection, all connections, or connections in a room, from the server side, and that the client can subscribe to a room, and send messages to the server, which can forward it to the clients. I always thought it's all kind of per connection or at least per socket.io socket.
[16:39:32] <DPA> But I only used it once a long time ago, I could be wrong.

[16:47:13] <DPA> Ideally, you should do the authentication on the server, at least whenever you get a new connection, or alternatively, whenever you need to check permissions.
[16:47:13] <DPA> The connections are all client<->server, and never peer-to-peer. The connection between client and server is, if ssl is used, encrypted, between client and server. But if the browser / a user can send the server a message initiating some action without authentication, then an attacker can do so too.

[17:45:26] <jhammons> Hello. I am wondering if someone can help my understand how to get a simple 'onclick()' event to work on the 'Save Image' anchored image here. I have outlined the problem I am facing and would appreciate any feedback if you have a moment to spare. Thank you for reading: https://bin.bitma.st/?8aa64f556c57df9b#6a4hWixPaCjfnYpK9enEgHRQ1yPMgxQn6GjGoK4CHhZS

[19:29:03] <quartz> Hi. I'm trying to reference a dictionary of dictionaries, which is essentially a small dataset stored in my server.py file here: https://bpa.st/PH4Q  I'm trying to reference the name in the first dictionary entry by doing data["1"]["name"] but it's not showing up on the webpage. What am I doing wrong?
[19:29:18] <quartz> The error is at line 10 here: https://bpa.st/Z24Q
[19:30:05] <EdFletcher> this is the javascript channel
[19:30:11] <ThePendulum> their second paste is javascript
[19:30:27] <EdFletcher> ah
[19:30:30] <ThePendulum> quartz: could you paste console.log(data)?
[19:30:56] <quartz> ThePendulum: I'll try
[19:31:21] <ThePendulum> just the start of it with one or two entries should do
[19:31:27] <quartz> ThePendulum: Nothing shows up :(
[19:32:34] <EdFletcher> then `data` is empty, which would explain why property accesses don't yield anything. where does `data` come from?
[19:33:06] <quartz> EdFletcher: it comes from my server.py file, which contains all the data I entered. It's just a small list of chess players, with rating, name, etc...

[19:33:50] <ThePendulum> can you show the template?

[19:34:38] <Rockwood> idk Ukraine people can access internet now days
[19:34:58] <quartz> I'm doing  let data = {{data|tojson}} in the "welcome.html" file
[19:35:37] <Rockwood> data shouldn't be in json format?
[19:36:13] <EdFletcher> that would be OK, JSON is syntactically-valid javascript
[19:36:15] <ThePendulum> quartz: then you need to do const data = JSON.parse({{data|tojson}});
[19:36:21] <EdFletcher> ^that's it

[20:00:26] <quartz> But still none of the names show up

[20:04:58] <bn_mobile> hi, is it possible to use https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_xmlhttprequest_create.asp with HTML pages?  or do these methods ONLY work with direct XML docs?
[20:05:11] <Svitkona> so what are you trying to do with line 8 in welcome.html
[20:05:21] <Svitkona> are you trying to declare a global data?
[20:05:55] <quartz> Yes

[20:07:07] <Svitkona> ok, it seems to work on my end
[20:07:34] <Lindrian> Hello. I have this seemly weird issue, which seems to only happen on Chrome. After having registered a service worker, the next page load will flash a "partially" rendered version of the site, until react kicks in and re-renders the page as it should look. I've narrowed this down to the service worker causing this, but I have no idea why. It does not happen in firefox.
[20:07:37] <bn_mobile> to be clear I'm asking about XMLHttpRequest Object Methods
[20:07:37] <Svitkona> i just added `$(document).ready(() => welcome_page(data));`
[20:08:31] <quartz> Svitkona: And the name shows up?
[20:08:43] <Svitkona> no, i see `undefinedundefined`
[20:08:47] <Svitkona> but that's probably a different issue
[20:09:19] <quartz> Yeah that showed up for me as well
[20:09:25] <quartz> Because the links are not made yet
[20:09:56] <Svitkona> in welcome.js, you shouldn't need the $() around data["1"]["name"] on line 10

[20:11:11] <bn_mobile> ok, it looks like https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/HTML_in_XMLHttpRequest clarifies this
[20:11:14] <Svitkona> i guess you're trying to create anchor elements with data["3"] and data["name"] ?
[20:12:41] <Svitkona> data["2"] and data["3"] are objects, so that probably won't work like you intend
[20:13:06] <quartz> Svitkona: Eventually I want to have these names as links to pages where the user can view more info about the players
[20:13:19] <quartz> Svitkona: Eliminationg the $() worked!
[20:13:33] <Svitkona> well, "worked" depends on what you're trying to do :)
[20:14:11] <quartz> I just want 3 of the 11 names to show up on the home page, created dynamically through JS. Than i want those names to also be links to a "view" page where the user can see more info about hte chess player
[20:14:42] <Svitkona> `$("<a href='/view/" + data["2"] + "'>" + data["name"] + "<\a>")`  should probably be  `$("<a href='/view/2>" + data["name"] + "</a>")`
