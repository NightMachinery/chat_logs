[02:03:45] <brianonymous> the only catch is key collisions fuck the whole batch, and that sucks ass

[02:45:25] <lz_> i've had a closer look at my current phone which produces 4kx3k, and the quality of those is actually even shittier. i should have made that comparison test before returning the other one

[03:35:30] <lz_> I thought you meant psychiatric help :) because I tried that
[03:36:36] <lz_> sometimes I just *need* to know if something is feasable, so I do it
[03:36:36] <MatthiasVance> Also regarding derailing, get a giant "Get shit done" poster in your room?
[03:36:53] <MatthiasVance> I want one but deciding that already did the job :p

[03:51:02] <Suchiman> lz_: yeah with a better camera app you can force the ISO to be 100 but as a tradeof you must either have more lighting or increase the shutter time to stay open longer which means the image gets more shakey easily so you need something to keep the camera steady
[03:51:28] <MatthiasVance> See lz_ , you just needed someone that has already done this kind of stuff :D

[07:15:12] <wroathe> So I'm a bit confused on what the idiomatic way to handle output from the streams of a subprocess is with C#. I found an answer that suggested using BlockingCollection to capture the output from the events as they're triggered
[07:15:47] <wroathe> And this seems to work nicely from my initial test, but it has the drawback that if I run an enumerable to the caller they're not able to dispose of the collection after they're finished
[07:16:46] <wroathe> And I can't dispose of the collections on the subprocesses' exit event, because the consumer may not be done reading the input from it
[07:17:49] <wroathe> The synchronous version of the API for reading output from the sub proc's stdout and stderr is a minefield of deadlock conditions
[07:19:00] <wroathe> Is there a standard idiom for handling subprocesses in .NET?

[10:43:35] <jmer> MatthiasVance: yeah... I'm kinda impressed
[10:43:56] <MatthiasVance> Next step: Encrypt your DNS queries
[10:48:26] <MatthiasVance> Ouch recursion
[10:48:36] <MatthiasVance> Well, recursion is not even the issue
[10:49:08] <MatthiasVance> So I'm flattening stuff, but recursively doing things that are not flattened
[10:49:11] <MatthiasVance> Booooo

[11:11:45] <jmer> Did you sit on him?
[11:11:56] <khanred> No I used your wife
[11:12:15] <jmer> LOL
[11:13:25] <MatthiasVance> They traversed everything and made a nice list of the results?

[11:44:02] <teegee> jmer: at least you get irc at work
[11:44:35] <teegee> our goofs just block everything out with a few exceptions
[11:45:01] <khanred> WFH ftw
[11:45:08] <teegee> doing it
[11:45:37] <jmer> teegee: I use irccloud's client which is based on Electron... it's basically a browser client xD
[11:45:46] <jmer> I don't think they can block for that without blocking port 80
[11:45:50] <MatthiasVance> So, at least they're sending me the filament and auto leveling kit tomorrow.. rest is on backorder for 2 weeks
[11:45:59] <MatthiasVance> Damn why couldn't they just make that decision for me yesterday so I could have it today
[11:46:14] <jmer> and if they can/want to, just use the pure web client.
[11:46:30] <MatthiasVance> jmer: They can block the domain :)
[11:46:57] <jmer> MatthiasVance: then you set up an SSH tunnel to your VPS hosted somewhere
[11:47:27] <teegee> jmer: i'm running a lounge on a pi at home. I guess I could put that on port 80 and open my router to let that in. just seems unnecessary
[11:48:25] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Yeah that's what I did :D
[11:48:26] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I doubt they have an issue with irc or chat per say, it's probably more the fact that connecting directly to an IRC server from a corporate network CAN be a security risk

[12:45:39] <spinningCat> yeah but recieving information can give me idea
[12:46:14] <spinningCat> c# has a way to read receipts?
[12:46:33] <MatthiasVance> A read receipt is just an e-mail back iirc
[12:46:34] <khanred> I mean, I think that's something you'd have to implement yourself
[12:46:52] <MatthiasVance> spinningCat: Read receipt is still user action .. I doubt any user would send it to you
[12:47:10] <MatthiasVance> spinningCat: What is your use case? I've been doing large scale e-mails for a while
[12:47:28] <MaNa2k> i was literrally wasting 3hours due to traveling from home to school, and i couldnt study too much on busse due to getting headache if i did
[12:47:50] <MaNa2k> so i was watching movies\serials instead lol
[12:47:57] <spinningCat> i just wanna make sure there is no accident happen and the person i sent email got that email
[12:47:58] <khanred> hmm..
[12:48:26] <MatthiasVance> spinningCat: What kind of mails are you sending? You have to assume that it will arrive if your sending server says it's OK
[12:48:44] <MatthiasVance> spinningCat: Also, you have to worry about SPF/DKIM/DomainKey and set everything up correctly in order to have a higher chance of arriving in the users inbox
[12:48:58] <MatthiasVance> And if you use a single IP you have to check blacklists etc...
[12:49:09] <MatthiasVance> And make sure to warm it up if you're sending in bulk
[12:49:22] <MatthiasVance> So basically, don't do this yourself but rather use a third party :D
[12:49:38] <spinningCat> i am using ui path
[12:49:46] <spinningCat> i wish that has something built in
[12:50:40] <MatthiasVance> Most third party e-mail services have wizards you can follow (lol) to make sure everything is set up correctly, but if you haven't touched anything SPF/DKIM/DomainKeys yet .. it will most likely end up in spam
[12:50:47] <MatthiasVance> Because it's something you have to set in your DNS
[12:51:12] <MatthiasVance> (also don't forget DMARC)
[12:52:47] <spinningCat> how long did it take to implement mail service?
[12:54:38] <MatthiasVance> spinningCat: If you use a third party, less than an hour.
[12:54:52] <MatthiasVance> If you do it yourself? Months?
[12:55:52] <MatthiasVance> spinningCat: Use a third party. :D

[13:33:45] <Tobbi_> :D
[13:33:51] <MatthiasVance> Anyway, most people assume Germany from double 't' I think
[13:34:00] <Tobbi_> Your real first name is Alyx?
[13:34:11] <MatthiasVance> No that's my bitch

[14:30:07] <alguien> <irwiss> alguien: it will work if param type matches <- it seems to work even if it doesn't. As long as it's an array of a subtype anyway (POC: https://dotnetfiddle.net/34VLdM). It doesn't work if it's a different collection, for example IEnumerable<string> (if you were to leave out ToArray), but notice the type in POC, there's no Cast<object>(). Just FYI in case this fact may not be in your working memory

[23:40:22] <MatthiasVance> I set the speed to 1000. Nothing broke 😂
[23:40:35] <MatthiasVance> And it finished printing really fast!
[23:40:57] <bomb> set it to 10000
[23:41:00] <bomb> hundred times faster!

[23:48:43] <bomb> lol
[23:50:44] <Slade> the "wait that item doesnt even need a semiconductor because its just a tube full of plastic" effect

[23:57:23] *** Joins: sebbu (~sebbu@user/sebbu)
[23:57:24] <Nasp> Also 500 is quite fast
[23:57:52] *** Quits: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo) (Quit: Lost the game...)
[23:58:09] <Nasp> If you just go 5 x speed, remember it needs to also heat and melt the plastic 5 times faster
[23:58:19] <Nasp> And it can shake the machine so much it will become inprecise
[23:58:31] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Did it work at 1000?
[23:59:12] <Nasp> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aehCGalz4ms This is what 1000 looks like and it requires quite a lot of work and a specially made printer
[23:59:45] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: it still looks like a dog!
[23:59:54] <MatthiasVance> Printing the ender 3 v2 dog-2h
[23:59:57] <Nasp> I just somehow doubt it went 1000
