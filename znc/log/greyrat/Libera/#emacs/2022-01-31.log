[00:36:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It does have a --function-context option
[00:38:13] <aidalgol> I think that only recognises C-style functions out of the box.  You would have to define a "custom hunk-header".

[00:45:03] <aidalgol> thuna`: This is the closest thing I could find to lisp diff: https://github.com/froydnj/diff
[00:46:13] <aidalgol> Lisp-aware/oriented diff would probably be harder for the human to look at, since you would then essentially be diffing on the syntax tree, whereas diff is line-oriented.

[01:21:07] <pkal> irek: predicate
[01:21:08] <blaub> or does it mean "prompt"?
[01:21:13] <thuna`> Then emacs should be using no theme, which I think is what you want?
[01:21:21] <blaub> sorry i'm wrong
[01:21:31] <irek> pkal: predicate makes sense, thanks
[01:21:35] <rdr> i want it to use a theme when i'm using emacs(gui) but not in terminal (-nv)
[01:21:51] <TRS-80> irek: predicate
[01:22:07] <pkal> irek: It is an old Lisp tradition to indicate boolean functions.  Just like how scheme uses ? (list?, number?)

You literally *can't* leave in either game because in 1 it's a high security facility and an insane priest drugs you just as you go for the obvious exit, then it's other crazies chasing or dragging you further into the asylum; in 2, you're in the middle of nowhere, Arizona.

[08:00:51] <aidalgol> Doesn't change that the gameplay and atmosphere is more grating that creepy.

[08:05:02] <aidalgol> I thought FNAF was interesting until 2 came out and it just threw more nonsense into the backstory instead of progressing it.
[08:05:13] <twrk> but iuno it's tough when you gotta weigh the artistic value with the developers necessity to produce and be rewarded for their work

[08:06:40] <twrk> well, the internet/youtube actors, imo, pushed fnaf into needing to be more than it was. Although, I think it also pushed the creator to do more, but... went too far for me
[08:06:44] <aidalgol> twrk: I know Dark Souls fans would flay me for saying this, but I don't think it has a story, more just lots of flavour text and leaves it up to fans to fill in the blanks.

How can I diff two regions? I'd probably do C-x h in the single file buffer, and select relevant region in the other buffer, but I don't know how to diff the two regions.
[09:22:29] <wgreenhouse> Viking667: you could narrow-to-region in the second buffer

[20:20:10] <fsbot> interactive is a special form in ‘C source code’.
[20:20:10] <fsbot> (interactive &optional ARG-DESCRIPTOR)
[20:20:10] <fsbot>   Probably introduced at or before Emacs version 1.6.
[20:20:10] <fsbot> Specify a way of parsing arguments for interactive use of a function. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
[20:21:12] <corwin> ^  understand `interactive' is to grok the difference between commands (which are available via M-x) and functions (which can only be used in code "expressions" (and, thus, via `eval-expression')

[21:09:09] <TRS-80> As a variation on that theme, you could write some ELisp to generate a new file every time you open Emacs and put the date in the title if you want to do some sort of 'daily file' workflow as seems to be popular lately.
[21:09:13] <Demosthenex> TRS-80: yes, but i was making a suggestion regarding search which didn't require re-reading it all like grep. helm even has plugins into recoll
[21:09:35] *** Joins: Diablo-D3 (foobar@exelion.net)
[21:09:36] <Demosthenex> TRS-80: recoll is a full text search for all documents. i use it to maintain 3 libraries of pdfs and work files
[21:09:59] <ano> TRS-80: according to https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/19895 it's a sort of *scratch* replacement mechanism
[21:10:12] <Demosthenex> if you have 300 megs of org files, grepping has to read alot of data, but recoll has a small DB it queries
[21:10:41] <TRS-80> Well, Recoll needs to re-read it too, it just does it in the background.  And this could be out of sync.  Grep is always up to date, and -- at least the size of my files -- so far works for me near enough to instantly that I don't bother with Recoll (yet).

[22:23:14] <[w]> its just silly to have to open a browser or some other not-in-emacs thing for what is just text/documentation. surely im not the only one that sees its a bit silly?
[22:24:07] <technomancy> it's a bit silly
[22:24:10] <cvandusen> rudybot_: I wish authors would include the end notes right in the text. Why do I have to page to the back of the book?
[22:24:22] <technomancy> I prefer eww for documentation that is only available as HTML for wahtever reason
[22:24:33] <technomancy> but documentation that is available in plaintext is obviously much better
[22:24:37] <rudybot_> cvandusen: oh its still quite funny, imo. especially if you read the authors notes and understand that he is not actually against nosql. just againsts using it everywhere.
[22:25:15] <thuna`> What?
[22:25:56] <[w]> cvandusen: i dont have to open another book for the end notes tho

[22:27:31] <cvandusen> and, to make the analogy more relevant, it could be the bibliography.
[22:28:36] <TRS-80> I mean the whole 'self-documenting' thing I find a rather neat feature of Emacs, why eschew that?
[22:29:05] <thuna`> It's kind of like if inside a book it said see "Chapter X" for how this works. It's possible to do it correctly just as it is possible to do it incorrectly
[22:29:12] <[w]> i do enjoy having documentation immediately accessible
[22:29:25] <thuna`> "See chapter X for how this works"*
[22:30:13] <thuna`> It's ok as long as it's not redundant, I would say
[22:32:35] <[w]> another obvious point is an internet connection being required for documentation. yes i could have git clone'd and all that, but in the case of pulling packages from melpa, out of luck if i wasnt mindful of pulling down documentation.
[22:33:41] <TRS-80> [w]: package.el is pulling the elisp and parsing the ;; Commentary out from that, so this is not a strong point in your case (even though I am on your 'side')  :)
[22:34:07] <TRS-80> I mean, I think that's how it works
