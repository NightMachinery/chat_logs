[00:30:15] <Grinnz> oh, "use of other core modules"

[00:31:35] <Grinnz> i don't think the underlying file modules really need to be reinvented. some of them are complex for good reason, a lot of them are just in need of revamping
[00:32:08] <ether> there's also "cruft" :)
[00:32:20] <ether> File::Spec in particular has a horrendous OO model that could use a redo
[00:32:23] <Grinnz> i mean yes the design of File::Spec is pretty horrible, but unless someone who really understands portable filepath handling and also is good at design wants to reinvent it, we can't really force that to happen

[01:03:43] <Juerd> I don't think that's worth adding special syntax for
[01:03:53] <Grinnz> perl doesn't have an existing syntax that perl coders will recognize as "make this a copy instead of an alias"
[01:04:04] <Juerd> Although if such syntax would be allowed in other places where you get aliases, like signatures, it'd be kinda cool.

So system perl is above it. It's a mac, and homebrew expects to be in zprofile and weechat pulls in perl there as well, so homebrew perl was at the top
[04:31:06] <mruszczyk> moving it to .zshrc does put it at the front as expected. thank you.

[22:34:54] <mst> pragma-: yeah, I really wouldn't bother since you'd end up with a hybrid codebase
[22:36:32] <xenu> my problem with MIT and similar licenses is that when you build a binary of a program/library using that license, you have to include the whole copyright notice and license somewhere visible
[22:36:50] <xenu> it's annoying, especially when you have MIT stuff hidden somewhere deep in your dependency tree
[22:37:19] <xenu> despite the fact how short and easy to understand the license is, not many people know about this requirement
[22:37:30] <xenu> and i'd argue that MIT is the most frequently violated license in the world
[22:37:52] <mst> isn't MPL mozilla public license not MIT
[22:38:06] <xenu> yes, but he was talking about switching to MIT
[22:38:22] * mst just licenses things 'same license as perl' and moves on
