[01:56:33] <Simplar> As for the triangle number formula. (-1)^(1-1) n^2+(-1)^(2-1) (n-1)^2+...+(-1)^(n-1) (n-(n-1) )^2. I've spoken about this idea to simplify these: use partial sums of first and second, then third and fourth, ..., etc up to the end. I've got (2n-1)+(2n-5)+(2n-9)+...+what?? I can't find the last general term, because if there are even summands, it's one story, if there are odd summands, then the last summand stays (-1)^(n-1) (n-(n-1) )^2.
[01:58:18] <Simplar> I do understand if there are even amount of summands, we get 0.5x the original summands if we take one bracket as a new 'summand'. If there are odd amount of summands, then we get (0.5x the original summands)+1 summand.

[02:00:17] <Simplar> I can take any amount of first summands: (2n-1)+(2n-5)+(2n-9)+(2n-13), for example, and find their partial sum. I've noticed a peculiar thing.
[02:00:47] <Simplar> (2n-1)+(2n-5) = 4n-6 = 2(2n-3)
[02:01:14] <Simplar> (2n-1)+(2n-5)+(2n-9) = 6n-15 = 3(2n-5)
[02:01:44] <Simplar> (2n-1)+(2n-5)+(2n-9)+(2n-13) = 8n-28 = 4(2n-7)
[02:02:07] <Simplar> So each partial sum kinda has the connection to n amount of summands

[06:51:53] <isekaijin> What you know is this: “votes = upvotes + downvotes” and “spread = 1 + upvotes - downvotes” and “downvotes / (1 - ratio) = upvotes / ratio”.\
[06:52:29] <isekaijin> I wrote the equations this way so that it's a linear system on the unknowns (“votes”, “upvotes”, “downvotes”).
[06:52:37] <isekaijin> Mmm, maybe you don't need the first equation.

[06:53:01] <isekaijin> Okay, so just “spread = 1 + upvotes - downvotes” and “downvotes / (1 - ratio) = upvotes / ratio”.
[06:53:35] <isekaijin> How many unknowns do we have? Two: “upvotes” and “downvotes”, since “spread” and “ratio” are known.
[06:54:31] <Z-module> As the late US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said, "Gentlemen, first, you have the known unknowns. ...."
[06:56:18] <isekaijin> And how many equations do we have? Also two.
[06:56:21] <isekaijin> So, in the general case, it should be possible to find “upvotes” and “downvotes” by solving this system of equations
[06:56:24] <isekaijin> There's one degenerate case, though.
[06:57:28] <isekaijin> If the ratio is 50%, then all that you can tell is that upvotes = downvotes, but nothing else.

[07:40:06] <audiobirb> solution doesn't exist
[07:40:21] <isekaijin> Okaaay.
[07:40:36] <isekaijin> In your particular case, since the ratio is 75%, there are 3 upvotes for each downvote.
[07:40:43] <isekaijin> That is, “upvotes = 3 * downvotes”.
[07:41:11] <isekaijin> Then, “4 = spread = upvotes - downvotes = (3 * downvotes) - downvotes = 2 * downvotes”.
[07:41:36] <isekaijin> Hence “downvotes = 4 / 2 = 2” and “upvotes = 3 * 2 = 6”.
[07:42:47] <isekaijin> As for why I didn't originally bother - I was trying to clear a stage in a video game.
[07:43:07] <audiobirb> isekaijin, lol
[07:44:50] <audiobirb> isekaijin, how did you deduce "3 upvotes for each downvote" from a 75% ratio?
[07:45:20] <isekaijin> 75% = 3/4
[07:45:27] <audiobirb> ah
[07:45:34] <audiobirb> i knew that but just realized how you did it
[07:45:39] <audiobirb> interesting
[07:45:54] <isekaijin> Or, if you want to be super pedantic...
[07:46:07] <isekaijin> upvotes / downvotes = ratio / (1 - ratio) = 75% / 25% = 3
[07:49:31] <audiobirb> isekaijin, did you guess and check at all during your solving? I'm not seeing how you got "downvotes = 4 / 2"
[07:49:38] <audiobirb> where did the 4 come from
[07:50:04] <audiobirb> or did you determine "upvotes" first, before downvote
[07:50:17] <isekaijin> I computed “downvotes” first.
[07:50:25] <isekaijin> We had “4 = spread = ... = 2 * downvotes”.
[07:50:40] <isekaijin> Dividing both sides by 2, we have “downvotes = 4 / 2 = 2”.
[07:50:56] <isekaijin> Only then did I compute upvotes, using “upvotes = 3 * downvotes = 3 * 2 = 6”.

[07:59:54] <audiobirb> that may not have made sense but let me know if you understand what i mean
[08:03:32] <isekaijin> I guess you could draw a pie chart, 75% upvotes and 25% downvotes.
[08:03:37] <isekaijin> You start with 0 upvotes and 0 downvotes.
[08:03:51] <isekaijin> You throw in 3 upvotes and 1 downvote.
[08:04:10] <isekaijin> What spread do you get? 3 - 1 = 2, not quite 4, so we need to throw in more.
[08:04:25] <isekaijin> You throw in 3 more upvotes and 1 more downvote.
[08:04:32] <isekaijin> What spread do you get? 6 - 2 = 4. Bingo.

[08:10:29] <isekaijin> I mean, the only way that doesn't rely on guessing.
[08:10:54] <isekaijin> Well, I guess you could invent your on visual system that has the same meaning as the calculation.
[08:11:23] <isekaijin> But the mental effort is in actually doing the calculation, not in using this or that representation (symbols vs. images vs. whatever).
[08:11:40] <isekaijin> your own*
[08:12:38] <isekaijin> If you replace symbols (like the digits 0...9 or the arithmetic operators +-*/) with something else, the mental effort of doing arithmetic isn't going to somehow reduce.
[08:12:56] <audiobirb> right
[08:14:53] <isekaijin> I understand that there are downsides to wasting time and effort in learning highly abstract mathematics. But there are literally no downsides to spending a little effort in learning school-level mathematics. Being a functioning member of today's society requires some competence in it.
[08:15:33] <audiobirb> isekaijin, i presented this problem to one senior level dev and another dev and they couldn't help me
[08:16:34] <audiobirb> isekaijin, yes this is school-level math, and i understand the problem should be easy, but it's proven to be a challenge for anyone who does not do math for a living (or at least is not in ##math)

[08:31:51] <isekaijin> In *that* language, you can genuinely say that the value of a variable is the list [1,2,3].
[08:32:14] <isekaijin> Not some arbitrary location in memory that's irrelevant to your problem.
[08:33:02] <isekaijin> It works by making a distinction between “the list [1,2,3]” and “a mutable memory cell that happens to contain the list [1,2,3] right now”.

[09:17:57] <isekaijin> One way is to treat formulas as strings, another is to treat them as syntax trees.
[09:19:29] <isekaijin> If you treat formulas as strings, then maybe you need the parentheses to prevent accidents like “neg P -> Q”, where it's ambiguous whether you mean “(neg P) -> Q” or “neg (P -> Q)”.
[09:20:01] <fsoc> But in this case there isn't ambiguity, right? Since P is the only proposition.
[09:20:32] <isekaijin> The rules have to be defined taking into account ALL cases.
[09:20:45] <isekaijin> Making lots of special rules for individual cases is annoying and error-prone.
[09:21:39] <fsoc> I see. So, if need brackets (), there must be two propositions joined by a connector, or there should be an ambiguity, right?
[09:21:43] <isekaijin> Oh, also, if you treat formulas as syntax trees, then this issue doesn't happen, and you can safely treat “neg F” as a wff, even if F is itself a complicated wff.
[09:22:13] <isekaijin> Because the placement of the parentheses can be deduced from the tree structure.
[09:22:38] <fsoc> Yeah.

[13:05:02] <Simplar> I’m trying to prove that the formula (-1)^(1-1)n^2+(-1)^(2-1)(n-1)^2+...+(-1)^(n-1)(n-(n-1))^2 is equal to 1+2+...+n, assuming that I don't know anything about triangular numbers. So I've deducted that n^2-(n-1)^2=(n-n+1)(n+n-1)=2n-1, (n-2)^2-(n-3)^2=2n-5, and so on. Now if there was odd number of summands in the original sum, I have 2k+1 summands, and if there was an even number of summands in the original sum, I have 2k summands, where k =
[13:05:02] <Simplar> ⌊n/2⌋. Now, finding partial sums of new series, I get (2n-1)=1(2n-1), (2n-1)+(2n-3)=2(2n-3), (2n-1)+(2n-5)+(2n-9)=3(2n-5), and so on. This means I have a formula for sum of k summands equal to k(4k-(2k+1))=k(2k-1). Substituting k by n, I have n=2k for the even case, thus the formula for even number of summands becomes (n(n-1))/2. But the odd case gives me something very odd (I suppose I need to sum (n-1) summands, and then add 1^2 which is correct),
[13:05:02] <Simplar> but I don't get to the same formula. How to go to 1+2+...+n from there?

[14:56:37] <riv> Here is something I know
[14:56:43] <riv> if P is a polynomial of degree n
[14:57:07] <Simplar> riv: long but shows my own effort at trying to prove it
[14:57:12] <riv> Sum[k=0,n] P(k) is expressible as a polynomial, of degree n+1
[14:57:33] <Simplar> Which theorem is that, riv?
[14:58:43] <riv> I'm not sure the name of it. It is here https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/publications/Gleich%202005%20-%20finite%20calculus.pdf but this also goes into a lot more detail or related things
[14:59:03] <riv> normally we think of polynomials as being sums of 1,x,x^2,x^3,..
[14:59:27] <riv> but it is useful to use a different basis, (x C 1), (x C 2), (x C 3), ...
[14:59:57] <riv> using this basis, it's very easy to show that sums of polynomials are (degree n+1) polynomials
[15:00:29] <riv> How this relates to your question is that you are doing the summation of (-1)^k k^2
[15:00:33] <riv> this isn't a polynomial
[15:00:50] *** Quits: [-_-] (~fractal@user/---/x-1675478) (Quit: ZZZzzz?)
[15:00:54] <riv> but if you take 2 terms at a time, you are looking at sums of (2k)^2 - (2k+1)^2
[15:01:01] <riv> this is a polynomial so the theory applies
[15:01:27] <riv> So the key theorems I would recommend you look at for this are:

[16:58:25] <joel135> SLSQP seems to be a more general-purpose method. it won't be as efficient as ones that are tailored to the common "quadratic objective + linear constraint" type problems. in particular SLSQP probably knows nothing about how to handle sparsity, which is probably why it wants more than 256 GiB from you

[19:21:46] <joel135> on the level of complexes, a morphism is *defined* to commute with differentiation
[19:22:15] <isekaijin> Sure.
[19:22:18] <joel135> maybe it is more about perspectives. blind men and an elephant and so on
[19:22:53] <isekaijin> joel135: So you're saying that your definition of “morphism of meshes” must include “commutes with differentiation” explicitly as an axiom?
[19:23:17] <isekaijin> As for why I need morphisms to exist - even in a discrete setting, I want to work with analogues of “open covers”.
[19:23:31] <isekaijin> Your mesh could simply be too large to work with all of it at once.
[19:24:10] <joel135> well, this is my first time thinking about this since i heard about this only a day or two ago, but that would be a thing to consider.
[19:24:16] <isekaijin> ...
[19:24:29] <joel135> we can have different approaches to spaces, that fit different purposes
[19:24:54] <joel135> you know that since you have abandoned the analytic nature of manifolds already, in algebraic geometry
[19:25:02] <isekaijin> One that deprives me of good notions of “morphism” and “open cover” is automatically a non-starter.
[19:25:51] <joel135> if we mostly just work with the chain complexes, and see the meshes as presentations of these, then i don't see an issue
[19:26:14] <isekaijin> Sure, but then you are... uh... defining a space as a chain complex.
[19:26:30] <isekaijin> Which I guess you can do.
[19:26:47] <isekaijin> Homological algebra is an important part of algebraic topology, of course, but I would be hesitant to literally identify them.
[19:27:20] <joel135> i don't know what are the limitations of this idea for numerical practical use
[19:29:14] <joel135> right now i am mostly interested (not *seriously* interested though) in this in the context of numerical solution of PDEs/FEM and similar. not sure if this is the standard approach in this area or not.

[19:40:56] <Simplar> We know 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 3+5, 3^3 = 7+9+11, and so on. How do we get from here to the formula (n^2-n+1)+(n^2-n+3)+...(n^2+n-1)=n^3?
[19:41:07] <Simplar> joel135: indeed, saw it!
[19:41:30] <Simplar> I've tried to use odd number series as an arithmetic progression where a1 = 1, d = 2
[19:42:09] <Simplar> So n^3 = sum of n odd numbers starting from nth odd number
[19:43:34] <Simplar> I've then used a famous arithmetic progression formula to get a sum from mth to nth element of the progression
[19:44:07] <Simplar> which is (n-m+1)(a_m+a_n)/2
[19:44:54] <Simplar> Given that a_m = 2m-1 and a_n = 2n-1 (respectively), I can simplify (a_m+a_n)/2 = (2m-1+2n-1)/2 = (2m+2n-2)/2 = m+n-1
[19:45:30] <Simplar> Thus the formula of sum from mth to nth element becomes (n-m+1)(m+n-1)
[19:46:33] <joel135> i am not really following the algebra but you seem to have got the hang of it
[19:46:57] <Simplar> I'm just telling consecutively what I did and where I'm stuck, because I'm not asking to do everything for myself
[19:48:33] <Simplar> sum of odd numbers from mth to nth = (n-m+1)(m+n-1). Okay, okay, I get that. So, in our case for Nicomachus to get n^3 we must sum n odd numbers starting from nth, so from the formula n is replaced with 2n (because we start from nth and end after n more elements, hence 2n), and m is replaced with n.

[22:34:22] <Simplar> My question may sound really dumb but
[22:35:49] <Simplar> If we start from 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th (and so on) odd number to get the cube of 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, which jth number do we start from to get n^3?

[22:37:05] <Simplar> (e.g. 1^3 = 1, we sum up one odd number; 2^3 = 3+5, we sum up two odd numbers, starting from the next odd number after the last one used to get 1^3; 3^3 = 7+9+11, we sum up 3 odd numbers, starting from the next odd number after the last one used to get 2^3, and so on)
