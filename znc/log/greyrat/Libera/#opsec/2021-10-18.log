[01:13:31] <Joanna> e5e5e5tangy: interesting link .. Iâ€™ve seen those sorts of things also. It wouldnâ€™t be so bad if reports of harmless things were dismissed. Itâ€™s almost as if they are trying to prep people for terrorism or something
[01:23:15] <tangy> "the more countries that possess the atomic bomb, the greater the uncertainty. as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world, others will want to have them, that's the first axiom, and the corrolary is, sooner or later they will be used." - secret history of the atomic bomb, national geographic
[01:25:32] <gartt> Heh, that's not a very objective line from National Geo
[01:26:26] <gartt> Unless quoting someone, not the article writer. Nuclear arms also prevent wars due to MUD
[01:31:57] <Hydragyrum> don't you mean MAD?
[01:32:24] <tangy> iirc natgeo was the book's publisher on that one. I don't buy into the idea, though, that macro level changes can be premeditated. someone invents a new kind of phone, marketers sell, investors invest, entrepreneurs chase it, competition happens and there's a semiconductor shortage. newton and leibniz separately came up with the calculus at nearly the same time
[01:32:44] <gartt> Hydragyrum: I meant MAD. Not sure where I got the U from..

[03:37:55] <HaMsTeRs> Good morning everyone
[03:39:59] <Joanna> Hey HaMsTeRs I wanted to tell you Iâ€™m a high school dropout also
[03:41:05] <Joanna> Hi sch1z0_c0d3 welcome
[03:43:15] <HaMsTeRs> Good morning Joanna.  With your effort, I'm sure that already proved you are a success person.  This brought you to digital security field.  I've been messing around the SI (system integration) field for over 10+ years.  Still not yet have a chance to enter the Digital Security field.  
[03:44:06] <HaMsTeRs> I might think of lowering my salary and try to step in
[03:45:52] <Joanna> HaMsTeRs: success is a matter of opinion. Iâ€™m more of a software designer that a digital security expert
[03:46:23] <Joanna> What do you specialize in ?
[03:48:19] <HaMsTeRs> We integrates everything from Firewall, Network Switch/Routers, Wintel (AD/DC,DHCP,DNS,EXCHANGE,AZURE/M365+Hybrid,backup solutions, storage, virtualization etc.)
[03:48:57] <HaMsTeRs> we got a team for firewall and network, so we seldomly needs to touch
[03:50:12] <Joanna> I need to learn more about networking. Itâ€™s impossible to know everything. It good to have people with diverse skills :)
[03:51:00] <Joanna> My specialty is gui you could say.
[03:53:52] <HaMsTeRs> Joanna: you are right.  I remember I saw a devop poster, it's too many new stuffs introduce in the past ten years

[03:54:47] <sch1z0_c0d3> Hi everyone
[03:54:52] <maurice> yo
[03:55:00] <Joanna> Iâ€™ve remodeled a bit
[03:55:09] <maurice> howre u doing Joanna ? whats new ?
[03:55:57] <Joanna> I decided to dedicate this channel for friendly security/programmer chat

[03:57:16] <Joanna> HaMsTeRs: Iâ€™m not much for the idea of programming and hardware becoming like the fashion industry with planned obsolescence.
[03:58:57] <HaMsTeRs> :D
[03:59:58] <Joanna> It seems like a lot of developers are running on a treadmill trying to keep up with constant changes made just for the sake of change which has some bad security implications of people using things that arenâ€™t well tested that they just learned about.
[04:02:28] <HaMsTeRs> Solutions like automate the QA process exist, but not 100% bullet proof
[04:02:33] <Joanna> maurice: whatâ€™s new with you ? Any new projects ?
[04:03:18] <Joanna> HaMsTeRs: I do most of my own testing. Itâ€™s easier to fix bugs that way but sometimes others test .
[04:04:13] <HaMsTeRs> Wow... very impressed
[04:05:33] <Joanna> The most productive think from testing I think was being informed of missing features.
[04:07:21] <Joanna> Thing
[04:09:35] <HaMsTeRs> May I ask which programming languages do you get in touch most?

[04:55:25] <vaio> mh, may i ask why you aren't using some adblocker in order to avoid that ?
[04:56:50] <Joanna> Itâ€™s not the ads itâ€™s their desire to show me the ads :) if someone wants me to watch what they have to say they shouldnâ€™t show me ads :)
[04:57:53] <Joanna> Thank goodness there are still people who donâ€™t try to monetize who post videos.
[04:58:32] <vaio> mh, indeed.
[05:00:02] <Joanna> YouTube is ok for searches on how to do things I guess but I wish I could filter out videos with ads.
[05:00:34] <vaio> ok, i already have issue with that BraxMe person.  "use startpage, which doesn't collects all your data, so you can search anonymously" > that's untrue :s
[05:01:36] <vaio> not collecting data isnt the same as some anon service (but heh, ok; i guess he's trying to make it so most people can understand)
