[08:43:53] <ezio> isn't go a procedural language?

[08:44:34] <ezio> Yeah. I used it before.  I caught gonorrhea and diarrhea.
[08:44:56] <khanred> Can't spell gonorrhea without go
[08:45:12] <ezio> yeah, that's why you should avoid both
[08:45:54] <bkool> khanred, i thought you were cool. *wipes tear*. ;)
[08:46:00] <ezio> At one time I thought you were a good programmer and not a retard.
[08:46:12] <khanred> That was your first mistake
[08:46:32] <ezio> xD
[08:48:36] <ezio> I kept hearing about how good Go is.  I tried it.  Like tell me how this is not a highschool lang.
[08:49:16] <khanred> You can just not use it if you don't like it
[08:49:53] <ezio> Okay.  I have an open mind.  Convince me.  Why is Go so awesome?
[08:50:38] <khanred> I'm not interested in convincing anybody of anything
[08:51:26] <ezio> okay.  It's not a duty.  I'm asking.  No judgement.  Just what do you personally feel about Go.
[08:51:35] <bkool> khanred, Go isn't bad. just don't tell us you switched to Java. ;)
[08:51:50] <khanred> I enjoy minimalism
[08:52:04] <khanred> I think a lot of languages are tending toward adding more and more features
[08:52:26] <ezio> Yup.  That is a good trait. I feel that C is better than C++ for somewhat the same reason.
[08:52:33] <khanred> Yeah, I love C
[08:52:54] <khanred> But I get why people wouldn't agree
[08:53:13] <ezio> Yeah. Okay.  That DEFINITELY makes sense to me.  In fact that was the reason I would have for liking Go.
[08:54:17] <sysRPL> this side old trend of developers still pisses me off. it goes like this ... some big business has an IT programming department. leadership in this IT dept push to totally revamp a functional working front facing website for said business. the new webite rools out eventually, and it's slow, has loses important features, and has a bunch of extra stupid stuff like animations between searches, loading page results, making
[08:54:17] <sysRPL> purchases ...
[08:55:31] <sysRPL> and it makes everything really big. for example. fitting 4 results on screen in `tiles`, rather than the prior useful plain list of results
[08:55:38] <ezio> sysRPL, isn't that just incompetence?
[08:55:57] <sysRPL> ezio: but i see it happen all the time
[08:56:30] <sysRPL> that is, developers at some business earer to redo things, only to fuck most everything up
[08:57:21] <sysRPL> it's like craigslist layout. it works .... then imagine some developers come and `digg 3.0` it for the reason of `because`
[08:58:35] <bkool> just as a PSA for everyone, we just had a another pen test. if your db is not unicode (varchar vs nvarchar) then you have you some big XXS vulns
[08:58:35] <sysRPL> it's change for the sake of change ... and bad change at that .... and it pisses me off when i use the site and it gets lets function with content spread out in a bigger area
[08:59:43] <sysRPL> ebay did this in the past 6 months. they went and fucked up their seller interface in exactly this same way
[09:00:38] <sysRPL> ebay sellers used to have one screen with one list incorporating all your draft item, selling items, sold items, and canceled items
[09:00:46] <ezio> bkool, ouch.  XSS has a ton of shit vulnerabilities.  Link me.
[09:04:21] <ezio> I worked in network security for 7 years.  We are just fucked.
[09:06:16] <bkool> ezio, most db servers (like sqlserver) will convert unicode to ascii equiv. so if you pass "full-width" unicode chars it bypassesses .net protection and doesn't store as-is
[09:07:44] <bkool> if you store everthing in db as unicode you're fine. but if not. ouch.
[09:08:02] <ezio> I've heard of similar issues.  It's a cat-and-mouse game.  I recommend trying not to allow any XSS if you can manage it.  Otherwise, use a well-tested library and update regularly.
[09:09:58] <sysRPL> how exactly does non unicode database support lead to cross site scripting problems?
[09:11:40] <sysRPL> i have my custom svg implementation all working, even with <style> tag css support, but there was one bug and i now have to rewrite my svg path parser
[09:12:22] <ezio> You wrote your own svg support?
[09:13:01] <sysRPL> yeah it works really nice ... renderings in realtime opengl hardware with shaders
[09:13:25] <sysRPL> here is a test -> https://streamable.com/0ibrkf
[09:13:56] <ezio> heh
[09:14:53] <sysRPL> the bug i have to contend with is due to the svg spec -> the spec allows relative curve path data, followed by `compressed` absolute curve data omitting key information

[09:17:17] <sysRPL> in my prior path parser i had no way to recalculate that missing information when compressed absolute path data is encountered
[09:18:25] <sysRPL> so the fix i nned to finish is to not use realtive data at all ... to make all data absolute, and if i read relative path data, convert it to absolute on the spot
[09:18:38] <sysRPL> but to do that, that means i have to rewrite my path parser
[09:18:40] <ezio> absolute path is like a mathematical calculation?

[09:19:17] <sysRPL> relative means that coordinates are given relative to the last point. absolute means the points are the actualy points
[09:20:13] <sysRPL> when you have a bunch of relative data that would be fine ... except when in the case you run into compresses absolute path data which then REQUIRES you know the actual previous point positions
[09:20:34] <ezio> ah.  Yes.  I'm so dumb I thought it was all relative.
[09:20:48] <sysRPL> the `compressed` versions of path data rely on the previous data
[09:21:16] <sysRPL> it works fine, except when in my bug, you have relative curve data followed directly by comrpessed absolute data
[09:21:20] <ezio> ah.  I understand 12% of what you're saying.
[09:22:00] <ezio> Compressed absolute .. so like rasterized artifacts?
[09:22:01] <sysRPL> well here is my vector rendering implementation is only 127 lines of code -> https://gist.github.com/sysrpl/7ac82c4659182e795f2ca65574acbf59
[09:22:37] <ezio> what language?

[09:27:40] <ezio> Yeah.  C# is not good for most efficient-as-fuck needs.  But it's good for most things, and dev time is often more expensive than any other time.
[09:27:56] <sysRPL> {$l cfunctions.o] procedure CallCFunctions; begin CallFunctionInside.cfunctions.o ...

[09:28:37] <ezio> Shit.  Been a long-ass-fucking time since I seen anything pascalian.

[09:29:31] <ezio> Either do it C or do it C#.
[09:30:03] <sysRPL> i prefer to have an OS  with C functions, and use those functions from pascal

[09:31:46] <sysRPL> pascal makes it actually easy, because it has objects with properties, methods, and events ... along with interface types and managed types
[09:32:05] <ezio> interesting
[09:32:19] <sysRPL> see my intro video on my pascal site ... it has example of desktop app programming made actually easy
[09:32:57] <ezio> Did you already send me a link to that?
[09:33:22] <sysRPL> for example, in c / c++ strings still need babysitting, especially when it comes to using external c / c++ library routines
[09:33:46] <ezio> That's an understatement.
[09:33:59] <sysRPL> in pascal, you don't need any of that ... it's just string in the way pascal manages string types for you
[09:34:01] <ezio> Strings in C/C++ are a nightmare.
[09:34:25] <sysRPL> in pscal it's just `var S: string;` that's it
[09:34:39] <ezio> Is that super safe?
[09:34:51] <ezio> well
[09:34:58] <ezio> I guess it gets to my former point:
[09:35:09] <ezio> use a well-tested library for shit like that
[09:35:36] <sysRPL> in pascal a strings is a reference counted pointer with copy on write detection and a length at a negative offset from the string data
[09:36:08] <sysRPL> so you don't neeed to parse the string to find the length, and it works transparently with c / c++ functions
[09:36:23] <ezio> Don't you get all that with C#?  I mean ... is it safer than Rust?
[09:37:07] <sysRPL> the guy that designed these apscal features then went to microsoft and copied them into first visual j++, ms got sued for it, then he created c#
[09:37:29] <sysRPL> c# was designed copying all these features from pascal
[09:37:34] <sysRPL> anders heilsberg
[09:37:35] <ezio> That then would be the same dude that created TypeScript.
[09:37:39] <sysRPL> yes
[09:37:53] <ezio> okay
[09:37:57] <ezio> you have convinced me
[09:37:59] <sysRPL> everything he does is just right imo
[09:38:05] <ezio> yup
[09:38:50] <sysRPL> what's funny is when he started at ms vj++ he basically copied the pascal libary to vj++, then when he started on dotnet, he copied the pascal libary a 2nd time
[09:39:32] <sysRPL> itwnet  goes like this ... object -> marshalbyref -> component -> control
[09:39:43] <ezio> I still think that Rust is prolly more secure than C#.
[09:40:09] <sysRPL> in his pascal library prior to that it was ... objct -> persistent -> component -> control
[09:41:01] <sysRPL> the only difference is they named persistent to marshalbyref
[09:41:23] <ezio> but fucking fuck is that shit unreadable.  I could learn that, but he obviously realized at some point that being able to read code naturally was paramount.
[09:41:44] <sysRPL> what is unreadable? the gist i posted?
[09:41:48] <ezio> yeah
[09:42:36] <sysRPL> this is unreadable? https://gist.github.com/sysrpl/7ac82c4659182e795f2ca65574acbf59
[09:42:44] <sysRPL> that's plain as day clear
[09:42:59] <ezio> :|
[09:43:10] <sysRPL> just repalce begin with { and end with }
[09:43:15] <sysRPL> and it's basically c#
[09:43:58] <sysRPL> pascal P := NewPointF(0, 0); -> c#  P = NewPointF(0, 0);
[09:44:30] <sysRPL> pascal Canvas.MoveTo(P.X, P.Y); -> c# Canvas.MoveTo(P.X, P.Y);
[09:45:08] <sysRPL> pascal else if C.Mode = svgRelative then -> c# else if (C.Mode = svgRelative)
[09:45:34] <ezio> okay ... I would fail this in quality, but you're also not wrong ...
[09:45:49] <sysRPL> if anythign apscal is even more readable ... you don't need the extra paran ()
[09:46:18] <sysRPL> oh i even got the c# wrong

[20:09:18] <Nasp> Like in south park?
[20:09:47] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: whatever floats yer boat
[20:09:51] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: If you don't wear ffp2 it's easy to spot so I guess at least in public places you will get fines or something idk
[20:10:11] <Nasp> I have no idea what an FFP2 mask is
[20:10:41] <Nasp> Here everyone used to wear these things https://powerbanken.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3PLY-3PLY-Disposable-Face-Mask-Non-Surgical-3plymaskbn.jpg
[20:10:49] <Nasp> On their chin or with their nose free
[20:10:55] <MatthiasVance> It's better than no FFP2 xD.. I don't know in what regard, particle size? Different materials filtered?
[20:11:28] <blez> Nasp 2021, you don't know what FFP2 mask is? lol
[20:11:29] <MichaelLong> FFP2 are more durable, you can use them longer
[20:11:49] <JakeSays> blez: i dont know what one is
[20:12:06] <MatthiasVance> It's also a specification
[20:12:32] <blez> JakeSays N95 mask for US
[20:12:42] <blez> N95/KN95/FFP2, same thing
[20:12:50] <JakeSays> ah
[20:13:19] <JakeSays> although n95 and kn95 aren't the same thing
[20:13:48] <Nasp> blez:  No i do not
[20:13:51] <Nasp> Why should i?
[20:14:10] <blez> saves from corona
[20:14:12] <MatthiasVance> N95 is equivalent to ffp2
[20:14:32] <blez> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAdanPfQdCA - a good video explaining what's the difference between FFP2 and surgical mask
[20:14:47] <MatthiasVance> Ffp2 is what you use for spray painting for example
[20:15:05] <Nasp> blez:  Are there actually any proof of that
[20:15:34] <bomb> I wrap my sock from yesterday around my head for maximum covid protection
[20:15:42] <blez> yes. That's why in laboratories they use FFP2/3 when they deal with deadly viruses for example

[20:16:14] <sysRPL> can someone do me a solid and find a simple way to approximate an svg elliptical arc as a series of either cubic or quadratic curves? thanks
[20:16:34] <MatthiasVance> I wish I could do that sysRPL
[20:16:45] <MatthiasVance> Maybe I should spend some time on that
[20:17:23] <sysRPL> my canvas implementation can't handle partial elliptical arcs
[20:17:30] <sysRPL> ty
[20:18:26] <sysRPL> it doesn't have to be anywhere near 100% accurate. just an approximation would do
[20:19:20] <sysRPL> every webpage i look at on the subject has a bunch of greek math symbols

[20:28:06] <MatthiasVance> Lukky: How often did you fly?
[20:28:21] <Lukky> I paid for it a few times when they were cheap, but mostly Econmy shit seats...

[20:29:11] <Lukky> At most I stayed 1 week home, then back over the pond

[20:31:10] <Lukky> cost was 1 year total burnout
[20:31:15] <MatthiasVance> Lukky: Must have been a very lucrative job?
[20:31:22] <MatthiasVance> Also 😔
[20:31:24] <Lukky> oh, it was
[20:31:37] <Nasp> Well only 160km it seems, but it's across water on an island :d
[20:31:41] <Lukky> Paid off half my house in those 2.5 years :-)
[20:31:50] <Nasp> But aparently you can deduct all of those expenses
[20:32:08] <Lukky> Nasp: yeah, MTL was in full construction at that time.. like major highway stuff
[20:32:34] <Lukky> Nasp: yes... I added a lot of points on my CC

[20:33:17] <Nasp> ARen't there also some that gives you percentages back
[20:33:42] <Lukky> At some point I thought of moving nearer to a airport hub, like OHR, but fuck it...
[20:34:11] <Lukky> Nasp: yeah, I was paying many hotel stays with points, which I then claimed back from the customer(s)
