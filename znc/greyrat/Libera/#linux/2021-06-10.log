[06:22:55] <johnjay> what's the problem with wsl and filenames?
[06:23:11] <johnjay> i tried running windows vlc with a windows file as arg from WSL and it doesn't accept it
[06:23:11] <Psi-Jack> johnjay, Windows.
[06:23:15] <Psi-Jack> Simple.
[06:23:19] <johnjay> hah indeed
[06:23:26] <Psi-Jack> And.. Not a Linux issue.
[06:23:35] <johnjay> apparently vlc doesn't like URIs that look like 'file://wsl$/Debian/tmp/file.mp4'
[06:23:50] <[[R]]> johnjay: that sounds unfortunate for you
[06:23:58] <johnjay> sure. wsl isn't a linux issue. keep repeating it until you believe it i guess
[06:24:17] <[[R]]> a windwos program running on windows has nothing to do with linux...
[06:24:18] <Psi-Jack> Oh, I don't need to repeat it to believe it. WSL is literally /not/ running Linux.
[06:24:41] <Psi-Jack> WSL2, that's slightly different., But WSL.... yeah, not Linux, period.

[13:08:58] <alex3> what are the differences between qemu and kvm ?
[13:09:26] <BCMM> alex3: different layers in the stack. qemu can make use of kvm.
[13:09:26] <esselfe> kvm is more in the kernel-space and qemu in user-space
[13:09:37] <alex3> ah ok
[13:09:47] <alex3> so I can use kvm without qemu
[13:10:28] <BCMM> alex3: qemu is a fairly comprehensive set of software to emulate computers. includes software that emulates CPUs, hard drives, sound cards, network cards, etc. etc.
[13:11:00] <BCMM> alex3: kvm is the Linux kernel's built in virtualisation technology, for machines with hardware virtualisation features
[13:11:19] <BCMM> qemu can use KVM instead of one of its own CPU emulators
[13:11:49] <BCMM> thus providing effectively the same CPU performance as the host system, instead of the performance of an emulated CPU
[13:13:23] <BCMM> regarding using KVM without qemu, i'm not sure exactly what software is out there

[13:15:42] <BCMM> but KVM itself essentially just provides the ability to run code in a virtualised environment. it kind of provides "just the CPU and RAM" of a virtual machine; you tend to want something else to emulate other hardware

[20:30:23] <brejela> Huh. That's odd.

[20:30:45] <rascul> /dev/sdb doesn't exist but /dev/sdb1 does?
[20:31:00] <brejela> There's no disk but there's a partition? What.
[20:31:15] <brejela> Oh, wait. Seems like sdb1 is the disk...
[20:31:17] <brejela> What?
[20:31:22] <pitter> there is a /dev/sdb

[20:31:42] <rascul> brejela no, fdisk -l will show things if you do it to a partition
[20:31:51] <brejela> rascul: Yes. I see.
[20:31:52] <ananke> plujon: there is some swapping, look at 'si' and 'so' (swap in/swap out) columns. though it's very little
[20:32:02] <pitter> fdisk: cannot open /dev/sdb: No such file or directory
[20:32:11] <rascul> how you have sdb1 without sdb is beyond me
[20:32:15] <pitter> so the dmesg output is saying the usb is being put at sdb

[23:26:59] <lacroix> the problem with zero swap is that it increases pressure on the mm subsystem when you run out of memory and it has to do a lot of reclaim.
[23:27:11] <lacroix> with 16gb ram, no issue. but on smaller systems (embedded!) you can face strange ooms
