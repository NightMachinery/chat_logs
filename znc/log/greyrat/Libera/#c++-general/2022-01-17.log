[09:40:14] <jimmio92> ac_slater it's like C++ but they think it's "better". Just like objective-c people think it's "better" than C++. Myself, I prefer C with methods.:P  Off topic tho.
[09:40:24] <jimmio92> Asking here instead of #C++ since it's about a gcc extension afaict; should I avoid using nested-anon-types and gnu-anonymous-struct together like `struct Vec3 { union { float data[3]; struct { float x, y, z}; }; };`? Using it in this way improves usage dramatically without needing references, and also guarantees there is a contiguous location for
[09:40:24] <jimmio92> the data without having to ask the compiler to pack tightly. Seems to be a win-win, hence my asking folks who might know better. Thanks!

[09:42:01] <kalven> why would it guarantee contiguous locations?
[09:47:03] <jimmio92> Arrays are packed tightly, where as `struct Foo { T x, y, z; }` likely has padding at the end; or possibly anywhere as it's up to the compiler. Casting a structure to an array type feels like a horrible decision, and unfortunately some APIs expect a pointer vs. X number of values separately. Am I mistaken in my understanding here?

[10:00:29] <jimmio92> kalven I need it to be contiguous, yes. C++ doesn't guarantee that a struct is contiguous and the compiler is free to pad it however it thinks is best AFAIK, though again I can specifically ask it for no padding, but `__attribute__((packed))` is fugly-hack imo. Using a union with an array as the first element guarantees this, as the other elements
[10:00:30] <jimmio92> must take the same size, and therefore occupy the same memory.

[10:05:16] <ville> jimmio92: as in to view it in a debugger. it has additional garbage you print it in gdb, or you have to click little [+] icons in a graphical debuffer possibly
[10:05:27] <ville> err debugger
[10:07:20] <ville> it can be ok for the first few times, but spend hours debugging something and repeatedly clicking those [+] things open after you've restarted starts to get on one's nerves
[10:07:42] <ac_slater> (thinks we need a better debugger)
[10:07:52] <ac_slater> I think*
[10:08:00] <ac_slater> gdb causes me physical pain
[10:09:07] <jimmio92> Ah, that's a good point ville, I hadn't thought of the debugging side. I'll have to give that a go and see how gdb treats it.

[10:10:24] <ac_slater> fuuu
[10:10:39] <ville> umm what do you expect the compiler to pack there?
[10:10:45] <kalven> it's as packed as it can be
[10:11:41] <jimmio92> kalven I misspoke. Not that the sizes would match, rather the memory will be there for the largest size in the union, and memory is shared between both names.
[10:12:01] <ville> jimmio92: i once tried using glm, a popular math library for 3d graphics, and then had to debug something and immediately stopped fixing the bug and rather moved on to rip out glm from the project
[10:12:40] <kalven> jimmio92: right, but do you see the implication here? if you use data[2] and z interchangeably, you are *already* assuming that the struct has no padding
[10:12:43] <ville> jimmio92: it uses this kind of structural pattern extensively
[10:13:01] <kalven> side note: it's perfectly reasonable to assume that struct foo { float x,y,z; }; has no padding
[10:13:12] <jimmio92> Ohhh, sh*t, you're right.
[10:17:01] <jimmio92> uhh that was to kalven about using them interchangeably, lol. If it's safe to assume there's no padding between values, then I could just cast the struct to a pointer of type float and no longer depend on a GCC extension, which was half the reason I tried to write it like this :P
[10:17:45] <ville> safe in practice. not safe as far as the language is concerned
[10:18:13] <kalven> static_assert and move on

[11:30:11] <ac_slater> well I kinda did. Firing up a container to run a complex build to spit out some static binaries is OK. Even with binaries that need shared libraries, you have to know avoid rpath and shit and ldso and ldconfig will figure out paths.

[11:39:23] <ac_slater> ie - if someone uses autotools and your main system isn't autotools. You just have to run autotools then scrape the outputs. Sometimes its like `CFLAGS += -I<whatever>/src/.src/*.h` ... barf

[11:49:27] <oj> depending on what the surrounding context is, clangd may or may not give me a renaming quickfix
[11:49:39] <TinoDidriksen> Don't just rename it. Refactor it so all the renaming is done for you.
[11:49:43] <oj> it depends on how it feels
[11:49:54] <ac_slater> ville: hmm. I guess my makefiles do work if you change which objects they build during bisect. My build dir will just be littered
[11:50:02] <LordKalma> it depends on what i can pick up with its heuristics
[11:50:13] <oj> right, what I did was do a renaming with clang/tidy using naming convention rules
[11:50:45] <ville> ac_slater: if you've a build directory where everything generated during a build goes, then it should be alright to have "stale" .o files there. those won't be linked in as they aren't hopefully manually listed as dependencies
[11:50:52] <oj> but for some reason it couldn't fix the names in files where the identifier was used but not defined
[11:51:06] <ac_slater> ville: yea exactly. There are some edge cases sometimes, like if you glob
[11:51:11] <oj> so I just ran it on the header and went through the rest of the codebase with my editor and clangd
[11:52:06] <LordKalma> protip: don't glob
[11:52:20] <ville> ac_slater: in make it's probably more fun to list your sources, then create the list of object files from those: object_files := $(subst $(source_dir)/, $(build_dir)/, $(source_files:.cxx=.o)) or so rather than glob
[11:52:22] <ac_slater> ville: oh right, I guess I was thinking in the case where I change top-level flags like CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS or LDFLAGS. I never tried to be make execution aware of makefile changes
[11:52:36] <ac_slater> ville: yea that's what I do.
[11:52:39] <oj> LordKalma: one example was that it proposed a quickfix to a name error in a normal member function, but not in an operator
[11:52:49] <ac_slater> ville: and dep files too via gcc's -MP -MMD
[11:52:53] <oj> doesn't seem like there should be a difference heuristic-wise
[11:52:56] <ville> ac_slater: ok you're covered there then
[11:53:18] <ac_slater> ville: it's when I change makefiles I have to do a clean, but that's expected I guess. Cmake handles that

[14:54:46] <LordKalma> how scattered are your definitions?

[14:55:42] <fiesh> performance-move-const-arg.CheckTriviallyCopyableMove defaulting to 1 is really annoying I think, since it tells you to make your code not-future-proof
[14:56:02] <LordKalma> what's that one?
[14:56:20] <fiesh> it'll warn you if you move a trivially copyable type instead of just copying it

[15:37:29] <very_sneaky> i wonder how much of a burden that actually is once everything is integrated
[15:38:49] <PJBoy> probably zero
[15:39:00] <PJBoy> although we have lots and lots of builds and build configurations
[15:39:22] <PJBoy> merely updating libcurl is something we have to assign a JIRA story for

[15:40:19] <very_sneaky> PJBoy: is that because you're using a bespoke build system/package management solution atm? an uplift requires code to be written?
[15:40:41] <PJBoy> I can confirm that specifying --checks with clang-tidy disables the reading of .clang-tidy config file
[15:40:43] <very_sneaky> i mean, aside from interface changes, obviously

[15:45:32] <very_sneaky> well, fwiw, clang tidy tries to expand all of the gtest macro's in place
[15:45:56] <very_sneaky> so, they might pass, but it's certainly not an improvement to automatically apply those changes
[15:46:22] <very_sneaky> i've given fix a shortcut in vim, so i just review them in the editor and it's a quick change if it's sane

[15:52:32] <PJBoy> that I'll probably have to add exceptions for
[15:53:03] <very_sneaky> the thing that i haven't been able to resolve so far is that i have different case requirements for functions and local variables
[15:53:08] <very_sneaky> but lambdas are both
[15:53:18] <very_sneaky> and so they default to local variable style, which is annoying
[15:54:06] <PJBoy> I always use the same naming style for variables and functions precisely because lambdas exist
[15:54:51] *** Joins: markong (~kvirc@213.146.188.203)
[15:56:26] <very_sneaky> interesting. our style guide dictates a prepended `v`
[15:56:32] <PJBoy> ouch
[15:56:48] <very_sneaky> `auto vLocalVariable = 0.0` and `someFunctionToCall()`
[15:56:50] <PJBoy> ouch ouch ouch
[15:57:11] <very_sneaky> yeah, the more i think about it the less necessary it is
[15:57:26] <PJBoy> do you have something different for constants?
[15:57:29] <very_sneaky> i guess it helps disambiguate from public data members which have no prefix
[15:58:16] <very_sneaky> `const auto THIS_IS_A_CONST;` and `static const auto gTHIS_IS_A_GLOBAL_CONST = 0.0`
[15:58:51] <very_sneaky> heh, actually i might've got that wrong
[15:58:58] <very_sneaky> it might even be an `sg` for prefix
[15:59:06] <very_sneaky> the prefii stack
[15:59:14] <PJBoy> the static there is redundant
[15:59:24] <PJBoy> also :(
[15:59:43] <very_sneaky> i included it just because that's normally where it's a global
[16:00:26] <PJBoy> as a static member of a class?
[16:00:54] <very_sneaky> so we have `g` for global, `v` for local var, `m` for private/protected member, `s` for static, `p` for pointer, `e` for enum
[16:01:08] <PJBoy> but static means so many things ;_;
[16:01:25] <very_sneaky> yeah, though i guess in that case it should only really be s - clang-tidy likes to put a g there though
[16:02:02] <PJBoy> any global const is static unless otherwise specified
[16:02:15] <very_sneaky> CamelCase for class/struct/enum/namespace names, camelBack for everything else if you include the prefix
[16:02:25] <PJBoy> would you include s for vars that are implicitly static?
[16:02:42] <very_sneaky> honestly i have no idea - i don't use static very often lol
[16:02:59] <PJBoy> fun stuff
[16:03:10] <PJBoy> naming conventions are hard
[16:03:13] <very_sneaky> yeah, which i guess is opposite to the intention of a style guide
[16:03:54] <very_sneaky> it's annoying too - i've created a chrono compatible clock, so i use snake_case for all of the naming to be consistent with that api
[16:04:08] <very_sneaky> but it's inconsistent with the rest of the code base
[16:06:04] <PJBoy> my stance is to always deviate from stdlib as early as possible
[16:06:28] <PJBoy> as if to say the stdlib naming is crap and should be relegated to the darkest regions of the codebase
[16:08:18] <very_sneaky> do you mean avoid using stdlib at all?
[16:08:34] <PJBoy> nah, just their naming conventions

[16:09:52] <PJBoy> I feel like stdlib is intentionally designed to be bland and unlike everyone else's style
[16:09:55] <baltazar> hi! is there some nice way of using a function in the place of an output iterator? like back_inserter, but instead of inserting it into a container it would just call my function
[16:11:19] <very_sneaky> does it? boost seems pretty similar from my cursory understanding
[16:12:48] <PJBoy> I might not be right, but it sure seems that way
[16:13:00] <PJBoy> not many styles could write every identifier with snake_case
[16:14:34] <very_sneaky> yeah i guess that's true
[16:14:51] <very_sneaky> it's pretty one dimensional
[16:15:05] <very_sneaky> i feel like the linux kernel has everything in snake case too
[16:15:17] <ville> naming conventions are easy. snake_case
[16:15:21] <PJBoy> { auto f = [](int x) { cout << x << ' '; }; array data{1, 2, 3}; copy(begin(data), end(data), boost::make_function_output_iterator(f)); } #include <boost/function_output_iterator.hpp>
[16:15:22] <geordi> 1 2 3
[16:15:28] <PJBoy> baltazar, boost has that ^
[16:15:32] <LordKalma> naming conventions ate bike shedding. just name things right
[16:16:02] <PJBoy> which for some reason doesn't work with the ranges library
[16:16:15] <PJBoy> { auto f = [](int x) { cout << x << ' '; }; array data{1, 2, 3}; ranges::copy(data, boost::make_function_output_iterator(f)); } #include <boost/function_output_iterator.hpp>
[16:16:15] <geordi> error: no match for call to '(const ranges::__copy_fn) (array<int, 3>&, boost::iterators::function_output_iterator<main(int, char**)::<lambda(int)> >)'
[16:17:05] <LordKalma> probably not yet up to date
[16:17:17] <very_sneaky> i was surprised to learn that clang-tidy recommends the use of ranges where it can
[16:17:18] <LordKalma> sometimes I feel like boost is a bit laggy
[16:17:47] <very_sneaky> i changed a for each loop to match it, only to learn that apple-clang has literally 0 ranges support. rip
[16:17:50] <baltazar> PJBoy: meh
[16:18:08] <LordKalma> apple-clang is shit
[16:18:17] <very_sneaky> yep.
[16:18:30] <very_sneaky> it shits me that the apple-clang versions are tied to the operating system version
[16:18:37] <very_sneaky> because of course you can only get it through xcode
[16:19:00] <very_sneaky> having said that, it does have reasonably sane support for multiple co-installed xcode environments
[16:19:10] <very_sneaky> it's easy to switch versions
[16:19:13] <PJBoy> according to my test, that boost iterator doesn't satisfy std::weakly_incrementable
[16:22:05] <PJBoy> ah it's because its difference_type is void
[16:23:04] <PJBoy> a requirement added by C++20
[16:23:15] <PJBoy> that difference_type should be non-void
[16:23:48] <PJBoy> they even changed old stdlib iterators like back_insert_iterator to have a non-void difference_type for this

[17:21:36] <Haohmaru> ^
[17:21:43] <PJBoy> well cryptographs exist, that was my claim
[17:21:53] <PJBoy> and cryptography would be the study of cryptographs
[17:21:56] <PJBoy> so there
[17:22:05] <Haohmaru> only those who believe would understand
[17:22:13] <Juliu> PJBoy, like I said, if you find a proof for the claim that cryptography exists, then let me know

[17:23:28] <Juliu> PJBoy, that does not mean that cryptography exists

[17:24:25] <Juliu> PJBoy, your logic is incorrect
[17:24:40] <Juliu> Just because people study something, does not mean it exists
[17:25:16] <PJBoy> of people study something, then that process studying of studying exists

[17:26:21] <Haohmaru> no idea what ether is, but it'd be called etherlogy
[17:26:32] <PJBoy> and cryptographs exist
[17:26:42] <Juliu> PJBoy, the question if one way functions exist or not is unsolved. So how you can claim cryptography exists? There is no proof for that claim
[17:26:46] <PJBoy> so cryptography doubly exists
[17:27:03] <Juliu> I do not think that cryptography exists
[17:27:05] <PJBoy> the fact that there's a question about one way functions implies that cryptography exists

[17:35:33] <Haohmaru> that's up to you

[17:37:52] <Juliu> lionkor, I meant regarding the runtimes of algorithms of course
[17:38:45] <lionkor> i guess the issue with that is that you often can't be sure that there isn't some algorithm that can do the thing faster or not
[17:39:21] <Juliu> So it might turn out that all the fancy cryptographers and crypto algorithms and everything is all just complete bullshit

[17:49:40] <PJBoy> there are some crypto algorithms that require TSP to be hard
[17:49:47] <Juliu> fiesh, really?
[17:50:20] <Juliu> PJBoy, some? Name one that doesn't require it
[17:50:21] <fiesh> PJBoy: most don't though, at least those in standard use
[17:50:27] <fiesh> Juliu: RSA
[17:50:46] <Juliu> fiesh, RSA is not an encryption mechanism
[17:50:48] <PJBoy> yeah barely any require it
[17:50:57] <fiesh> it's not even known if it's NP complete, so TSP might very well be hard and RSA still broken
[17:51:18] <Juliu> fiesh, also you are incorrect. If travelling salesman wasn't hard, it would also be easy to crack RSA
[17:51:37] <Juliu> fiesh, what is not known to be NP-complete?
[17:52:13] <PJBoy> how would you use a TSP solver to break RSA?
[17:52:15] <fiesh> Juliu: integer factorization
[17:52:41] <Juliu> PJBoy, if you can solve TSP efficiently, you can also solve prime factorization efficiently
[17:52:48] <PJBoy> how?
[17:53:21] <Juliu> PJBoy, what do you mean how? Integer factorization might not even be NP-complete. It's definitely NOT harder than TSP
[17:53:36] <PJBoy> how as in how would you do it?
[17:53:41] <fiesh> actually, that makes sense, integer factorization lies in NP
[17:53:49] <fiesh> it's just not NP complete
[17:54:04] <PJBoy> the fact that integer factorisation isn't known to be NP complete means we don't know how to solve it using other NP-hard solvers
[17:54:07] <fiesh> so solving any NP-complete problem in polynomial time would allow integer factorization in polynomail time
[17:54:10] <Juliu> PJBoy, you reduce integer factorization to a TSP problem and then solve this TSP problem with your efficient solver
[17:54:20] <PJBoy> how do you reduce integer factorisation to a TSP problem?
[17:54:51] <Juliu> fiesh, no one knows if integer factorization is NP-complete or not. Don't claim wrong things
[17:55:04] <fiesh> Juliu: lol try reading again
[17:55:20] <Juliu> PJBoy, there are publications about how that works. It's not that hard
[17:55:28] <PJBoy> cite one
[17:55:51] <Juliu> fiesh, "actually, that makes sense, integer factorization lies in NP"  "it's just not NP complete"     Wrong!
[17:55:57] <fiesh> PJBoy: integer factorization lies in NP, so indeed solving any np-complete problem solves it in polynomial time
[17:55:58] <Juliu> Or maybe wrong. No one knows
[17:56:05] <PJBoy> fiesh, how so?
[17:56:14] <fiesh> PJBoy: that's the definition of np-complete
[17:56:27] <rpav> i'm pretty sure we don't know that prime factorization is not in P
[17:56:28] <PJBoy> but integer factorisation may not be NP complete
[17:56:32] <Juliu> fiesh, again wrong
[17:56:37] <fiesh> PJBoy: it doesn't have to be
[17:56:52] <fiesh> PJBoy: the solution to any np-complete problem solves any problem in np in polynomial time
[17:57:03] <fiesh> PJBoy: not just other np-complete ones
[17:57:08] <PJBoy> only if there exists a reduction from the np problem to an np complete one
[17:57:21] <fiesh> Juliu: yeah I meant to write "it's just not known to be np-complete", congrats
[17:57:25] <PJBoy> which there may not be
[17:57:45] <fiesh> PJBoy: that's the definition of np-complete, that any np problem can be reduced to it
[17:57:52] <rpav> _np-complete_ .. you can basically rewrite any np-complete problem as any other
[17:57:57] <fiesh> PJBoy: thus solving 3sat solves all problems in np

[17:59:17] <PJBoy> we just know that it would be possible to do so
[17:59:21] <Juliu> PJBoy, we know that. There are papers about it
[17:59:39] <PJBoy> no there aren't
[17:59:51] <urdh> P is a subset of NP so obviously there are some problems in NP that are also in P
[17:59:55] <Juliu> fiesh, there are many NP-complete problems
[18:00:04] <urdh> whether there are problems in NP that are not also in P is an open question
[18:00:15] <urdh> famously, the P = NP problem
[18:00:17] <Juliu> urdh, correct
[18:01:17] <Juliu> Interestingly, P = NP would not necessarily imply that one-way functions do not exist. So even then cryptography might still exist
[18:01:33] <rpav> anyway .. can you not `using B::B;` from a multiply-inherited class to get parent ctors
[18:02:15] <Juliu> rpav, why don't you just try it?
[18:02:22] <very_sneaky> Juliu: so, your claim is that because many cryptography functions are computable, it doesn't exist?
[18:02:45] <Juliu> very_sneaky, no, my claim is more because I believe that P = NP
[18:02:49] <very_sneaky> most people would accept that if those functions are merely intractable they are functionally sufficient for x amount of time, dependeing on the degree of intractability
[18:03:06] <rpav> also do you get a "worse" vtable if you have `struct S : B, V` for some class `V` with virtuals, than `struct S : V`
[18:03:11] <lionkor> P=NP? P cancels out, leaving you with N=1. !next.

[18:42:30] <nolyc> Haohmaru: A function declaration with an inline specifier declares an inline function.

[18:42:47] <Haohmaru> look how wonderful that is ^
[18:43:02] <Juliu> NFC never worked well for me
[18:43:12] <PJBoy> it confirms that `inline static void f() {}` <-- is an inline function rather than a static function
[18:43:37] <Juliu> PJBoy, not true. It does not have to be an inline function
[18:43:46] <PJBoy> did you miss the fact?
[18:43:54] <Juliu> What fact?
[18:44:05] <lionkor> lets instead fight over whether to put `inline` or `static` first. `inline static` looks wack.
[18:44:08] <Haohmaru> NFC should be violating the pandemic measures
[18:44:10] <PJBoy> the one nolyc reponded to Haohmaru with
[18:44:26] <Juliu> Haohmaru, there is no pandemic
[18:44:27] <PJBoy> the static has no effect in that declaration
[18:44:31] <PJBoy> so it should just be `inline`
[18:44:43] <jkaye> I have a better idea. East/west const flame war
[18:44:47] <Juliu> PJBoy, the compiler is free to ignore your "inline"
[18:44:58] <PJBoy> why do you think that?
[18:45:02] <fiesh> lol
[18:45:05] <Haohmaru> is there also a east/west volatile?
[18:45:11] <Juliu> jkaye, west!
[18:45:25] <Juliu> Haohmaru, no one uses volatile anyway
[18:45:30] <cbreak> Juliu: no
[18:45:35] <PJBoy> { const int volatile x{}; } // woo
[18:45:36] <geordi>  
[18:45:36] <Haohmaru> false
[18:45:36] <Juliu> no what?
[18:45:43] <cbreak> if the compiler would ignore the inline, that'd result in linker errors
[18:45:57] <cbreak> well, potentially...
[18:46:23] <Juliu> cbreak, what are you talking about? "inline"s are always just suggestions. They can be ignored if the compiler decides so
[18:46:25] <Haohmaru> i mean, does it change the meaning like it does in a pointer with const involved?
[18:46:30] <fiesh> in a world where cryptography does not exist, the compiler is free to ignore inline
[18:46:35] <PJBoy> ahahaha
[18:46:37] <cbreak> and more importantly, function-local static variables would be duplicated
[18:46:43] <cbreak> Juliu: no
[18:46:51] <PJBoy> the principle of explosion strikes again
[18:46:59] <Juliu> cbreak, yes
[18:47:02] <cbreak> inline int foo() { static int i = 0; return i++; }
[18:47:14] <cbreak> replace inline with static, and call it from multiple files
[18:47:23] <cbreak> the result will be different
[18:47:41] <Haohmaru> the result is, Juliu is a scam
[18:47:42] <Juliu> cbreak, replace inline with empty space. I never said it's the same as static
[18:47:58] <cbreak> without inline, it'll not compile
[18:48:04] <cbreak> because you get linker errors
[18:48:39] <Juliu> cbreak, then maybe in this situation the compiler is not free to decide
[18:49:04] <Juliu> But when the compiler is free to decide, just because you write inline, doesn't mean it's inline
[18:49:08] <cbreak> it may never decide freely. inline always changes the ODR violation rules
[18:49:19] <Juliu> cbreak, you are wrong
[18:49:21] <cbreak> inline functions can be deduplicated
[18:49:23] <PJBoy> {} int g(); int foo() { static int i = 0; return i++; } void f() { SHOW(foo()); } \\ int foo() { static int i = 0; return i++; } void g() { SHOW(foo()); }

[18:49:24] <geordi> error: 1.o: multiple definition of 'foo()'
[18:49:30] <cbreak> normal functions collide
[18:49:31] <fiesh> PJBoy: you are wrong!
[18:49:53] <PJBoy> { f(); f(); g(); g(); } int g(); inline int foo() { static int i = 0; return i++; } void f() { SHOW(foo()); } \\ inline int foo() { static int i = 0; return i++; } void g() { SHOW(foo()); }
[18:49:54] <geordi> foo() = 0 foo() = 1 foo() = 2 foo() = 3
[18:50:01] <PJBoy> inline confirmed required
[18:50:01] <fiesh> wrong again
[18:50:05] <Juliu> cbreak, there are cases where you write inline and the compiler does not copy your function's body into your code, but keeps it as a real function
[18:50:15] <cbreak> Juliu: so? who cares about that?
[18:50:17] <fiesh> cbreak: therefore you're wrong
[18:50:22] <fiesh> I'm with Juliu on this one guys
[18:50:24] <Juliu> cbreak, so it's not inlined then
[18:50:28] <cbreak> copying the function somewhere doesn't matter
[18:50:45] <cbreak> the only thing inline has to do is allow you to define the same function multiple times
[18:50:52] <cbreak> (in multiple TUs)
[18:50:55] <Juliu> cbreak, it does something else than what you wrote, since the compiler decided against your decision to inline the function
[18:50:57] <fiesh> similarly, `auto` is superfluous in C++
[18:51:01] <fiesh> you never get an automobile
[18:51:04] <lionkor> quick question; why does MSVC allow `void main() {}`? the ISO standard @ 6.9.3.1 ([basic.start.main]) says that it needs to return int for non-freestanding implementations, yet MSVC compiles this without even a warning... Why is this?
[18:51:05] <fiesh> the compiler just ignores it
[18:51:15] <cbreak> Juliu: the inline keyword isn't related to inlining the function
[18:51:25] <Juliu> cbreak, that's what I am saying
[18:51:30] <cbreak> no
[18:51:35] <Juliu> no what?
[18:51:41] <PJBoy> lionkor, it warns for me
[18:51:42] <fiesh> and what the hell does `double` double?  nothing
[18:51:45] <cbreak> you're claiming I'm wrong, when I say that inline matters
[18:51:50] <cbreak> so you claim inline doesn't matter

[18:52:07] <lionkor> PJBoy: must be your flags, i don't see anything: https://godbolt.org/z/T933x9Kh6
[18:52:19] <Juliu> cbreak, I said that your function is not necessarily inlined just because you write inline
[18:52:21] <fiesh> cbreak: double doesn't double your code, and `double inline` is thus twice as broken
[18:52:26] <lionkor> in fact, it turns it into a int main with return 0
[18:52:53] <fiesh> Juliu: you pretty clearly said "you are wrong"
[18:52:58] <cbreak> Juliu: whether the function is inlined or not isn't related to the inline keyword
[18:53:10] <cbreak> I never claimed it had anything to do with it
[18:53:21] <PJBoy> lionkor, yeah you do need some flags
[18:53:31] <Juliu> fiesh, yes, because I understood him that way that he said that inline means that the compiler is forced to inline the function, which is incorrect
[18:53:36] <cbreak> but the inline keyword absolutely has a use
[18:53:40] <PJBoy> lionkor, for MSVC you want to specify /std:c++20 or /permissive-
[18:53:42] <cbreak> and the compiler is NOT ALLOWED TO IGNORE IT
[18:54:06] <cbreak> if you try the example I gave, you can find out that indeed, inline is significant
[18:54:15] <PJBoy> similar to how in gcc/clang I would specify --std=c++20 and -pedantic
[18:54:23] <Juliu> cbreak, that is also not correct. Wheather the function is inlined or not is related to the inline keyword, even though the compiler might decide against your suggestion
[18:54:49] <fiesh> better go on breaking cryptography, Juliu
[18:55:01] <cbreak> Juliu: not really.
[18:55:07] <Juliu> cbreak, yes really
[18:55:18] <lionkor> PJBoy: still not a sane default to not even warn, my prof did `void main` infront of 200+ people in a lecture 2 years ago.
[18:55:31] <PJBoy> I agree
[18:55:38] <lionkor> is it a legacy thing?
[18:55:39] <PJBoy> I would go on to say that none of the compilers have sane defaults
[18:55:49] <PJBoy> legacy up to C++20, yeah
[18:55:51] <Juliu> cbreak, there are cases where you write inline and it gets inline, and you don't write inline and it does not get inlined. So saying it does not depend if your write inline or not is not always correct
[18:56:03] <PJBoy> they finally decided to make /permissive- on by default in C++20 onwards
[18:56:09] <lionkor> oh, sweet
[18:56:21] <cbreak> compilers can inline without the keyword
[18:56:29] <cbreak> and they can decide to not inline with the keyword
[18:56:35] <lionkor> inline has other uses, too, like telling the compiler that multiple definitions are the same thing and for it not to worry - quite important
[18:56:51] <cbreak> lionkor: that's its primary use
[18:57:00] <Juliu> cbreak, yes, compilers can inline without the inline keyword, and they can also not inline even if you wrote the inline keyword. That is correct
[18:57:50] <lh_mouse> In reality `inline` does affect the decision about inlining.
[18:57:55] <Juliu> cbreak, but there are cases where the compiler does exactly what the inline/no inline keyword suggests, so it sometimes depends on this keyword
[18:58:19] <fiesh> lh_mouse: does it really though or just the visibility of the function definition?
[18:58:20] <Juliu> lh_mouse, yes. It's a suggestion to the compiler
[18:58:22] <PJBoy> any citation for whether the presence of inline affects codegen?
[18:58:34] <PJBoy> I'm skeptical
[18:58:53] <lh_mouse> fiesh, see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-7.1.0/gcc/Optimize-Options.html
[18:58:54] <lh_mouse> -finline-functions
[18:58:54] <cbreak> if a function is only used in one place, then marking it as inline can enable the compiler to inline it, because that wouldn't duplicate code
[18:58:56] <Juliu> PJBoy, you can test it by comparing runtimes
[18:59:04] <lh_mouse> read the doc.
[18:59:12] <cbreak> but that's more a side effect
[18:59:24] <lh_mouse> `-finline-functions` wasn't default for `-O2` until GCC 8.
[18:59:37] <cbreak> in the same circumstance, enabling the compiler to see this in other ways (via lto, or marking the function as static), might do the same
[18:59:56] <Juliu> Who uses gcc anyway
[18:59:58] <PJBoy> it doesn't say functions aren't considered for inlining if they lack the inline specifier
[19:00:18] <fiesh> lh_mouse: oh indeed, but I guess gcc7 is historic now and doesn't count any more ;-)
[19:00:22] <lh_mouse> so with GCC 7 (and older) there is a difference about the probability whether a function is likely to get inlined or not.
[19:00:33] <PJBoy> and I'm quite sure they are considered for inlining even without inline
[19:00:39] <Juliu> PJBoy, because functions an or can not be inlines independant from the inline keyword
[19:00:44] <Juliu> *can
[19:00:56] <lh_mouse> afaict since GCC 8 they behave much the same.
[19:01:09] <lh_mouse> it only makes a difference in the case of `-O1`.
[19:01:35] <PJBoy> proof https://godbolt.org/z/KMTde6K37
[19:01:40] <PJBoy> unless they did add that flag to O1
[19:01:48] <Juliu> lh_mouse, what GCC does is not relevant for the spec
[19:02:05] <PJBoy> still inlined in 7.1 though
[19:02:06] <lh_mouse> there is also `-finline-small-functions` in addition to that option.
[19:02:10] <PJBoy> ah
[19:02:33] <PJBoy> gcc 7.1 with  -fno-inline-small-functions https://godbolt.org/z/GvhhWqYhn
[19:02:37] <Juliu> PJBoy, your "proof" is stupid since we said it could be inlined without the inline keyword, or not inlined even with the inline keyword
[19:03:32] <cbreak> https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/vv591W7We, go play around with this if you want
[19:03:50] <PJBoy> adding  -fno-inline-functions has no effect also
[19:03:55] <cbreak> note that I use -Os
[19:03:56] <Juliu> Deactivate the automatic inlining of small functions and write a normal member function in a class one time as inline and one time as not inline, and you'll see that likely the inlining depends on the keyword
[19:04:45] <PJBoy> ah -fno-inline-functions-called-once did prevent the inlining though
[19:06:12] <PJBoy> alrighty, inline specifier confirmed taken into account for codegen
[19:06:50] <Juliu> Wait, did I just convince PJBoy that inline is not a scam?
[19:07:06] <cbreak> says the Julius that claims that inline does nothing :D
[19:07:16] <PJBoy> provided the optimisation is sufficiently low
[19:07:19] <Juliu> cbreak, dude, I totally said something else
[19:07:33] <Juliu> cbreak, I was right from the beginning. Deal with it
[19:07:38] <cbreak> heh :D
[19:08:40] <PJBoy> what's the tldr of what you were claiming Juliu ?
[19:10:09] <cbreak> here, an other example: https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/74K9eWco3 you can clearly see that inline matters.
[19:10:17] <cbreak> and it is different from both static and nothing
[19:11:20] <Juliu> PJBoy, that in some instances the inlining of the function depends on the presence of the inline keyword
[19:11:50] <PJBoy> on code-gen, yeah
[19:12:20] <cbreak> Juliu said: "cbreak, what are you talking about? "inline"s are always just suggestions. They can be ignored if the compiler decides so".
[19:12:27] <Juliu> Anyway, let's not argue. Inline is a scam
[19:12:29] <PJBoy> language-wise it's a non-negotiable change to how ODR is applied on the function
[19:12:40] <cbreak> and that's obviously wrong.
[19:12:50] <Juliu> cbreak, yes, the "always" was incorrect
[19:13:20] <sprout> inline in C++ doesn't mean inline as in C
[19:13:29] <sprout> as far as I remember
[19:13:45] <Juliu> There is inline in C ? I don't even remember most C things
[19:13:49] <rpav> or as in the way basically anyone else means it, including the dictionary ;)
[19:13:58] <cbreak> the key point that has to be remembered about inline is: inline is about ODR, not inlining.
[19:14:24] <Juliu> cbreak, I disagree
[19:14:24] <cbreak> sprout: inline in C is #define? :D
[19:14:29] <sprout> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/inline
[19:14:53] <PJBoy> C has the same inline
[19:15:02] <PJBoy> but they also have inline static, which is different than C++
[19:15:19] <rpav> what does theirs do
[19:15:33] <PJBoy> allows the function definitions to be written differently
[19:15:40] <PJBoy> provided they have the same behaviour
[19:15:46] <lionkor> inline in C is *only* a function specifier
[19:15:47] <sprout> inline in c++ says something about the declaration,  inline in C says that a function is meant to be 'inlined' at the call site.  not sure about c
[19:15:48] <rpav> 🤔
[19:16:00] <PJBoy> so different implementations of that function could get inlined to different parts of codegen
[19:16:28] <rpav> like hypothetically you could use `inline static` like that in C++ couldn't you
[19:16:41] <PJBoy> you could try
[19:16:45] <rpav> it wouldn't be an ODR violation because static void foo() in a.cpp is not static void foo() in b.cpp
[19:16:48] <Juliu> Somehow I'm always the only one who writes inline in code
[19:16:49] <PJBoy> not sure what the compilers would have to say about that
[19:17:00] <PJBoy> nah in C++ inline takes priority over static
[19:17:07] <PJBoy> the functions wouldn't be static at all
[19:17:08] <rpav> i'm mostly not sure why you _would_
[19:17:14] <rpav> oh, that would be a difference i guess
[19:17:20] <sprout> inline is decoupled from whatever it meant in c
[19:17:30] <rpav> though i thought i had a problem with that at some point
[19:17:51] <sprout> "The original intent of the inline keyword was to serve as an indicator to the optimizer"
[19:18:07] <sprout> that hasn't been true for a while now
[19:18:57] <LordKalma> "The inline specifier (contrary to the popular belief about inlining in the compiler sense), serves to mark that a function can be defined in many TUs (as long as the definitions are identical). This usually happens via multiple header includes, so this is the place to define them. The nuanced effect of this is making the definition available in the TUs the function is used, therefore indirectly helping compiler inlining."
[19:19:37] <rpav> yeah that's C++ .. "A-B Problem: The Language"
[19:22:01] <sprout> basically 'inline' allows you to move an implementation to a header at the expense of it being included in multiple translation units
[19:22:08] <LordKalma> we have this discussion so often I literally went to my chat log to pick that up
[19:22:21] <LordKalma> I wrote that Dec 26 16:22:57
[19:22:28] <LordKalma> (local time)
[19:22:36] <PJBoy> the most used parts of C++ are the least well understood
[19:22:38] <sprout> it has nothing to do anymore with the optimizer.  unless except for removing all copies
[19:23:05] <LordKalma> sprout, without LTO, the compiler can only inline what it knows about
[19:23:16] <LordKalma> so yes, it does have to do with the optimizer in the nuanced sense I described
[19:23:42] <PJBoy> it helps with inlining otherwise with the right compiler flags
[19:23:53] <rpav> but it doesn't
[19:23:55] <lh_mouse> [23:44:53] <PJBoy> C has the same inline  // `inline` in C is a totally different thing.
[19:24:00] <LordKalma> in the sense that you might want to write something as an inline function exactly for the multiple TU availability
[19:24:11] <PJBoy> I understand inline in C to act the same as C++
[19:24:12] <Juliu> sprout, couldn't you just instead have the implementation of a static function in your header file as well?
[19:24:12] *** Joins: ahlk (~user@2600:1700:31c0:3a10::43)
[19:24:20] <PJBoy> rpav, it does
[19:24:23] <LordKalma> rpav, in the "standards sense", yap, not really
[19:24:25] <PJBoy> I listed a godbolt link earlier
[19:24:27] <rpav> {} inline void foo();
[19:24:28] <geordi>  
[19:24:39] <rpav> PJBoy: it is orthogonal, and therefore adds nothing
[19:24:50] <sprout> Juliu: no.  even static functions need to go somewhere
[19:24:58] <PJBoy> what's orthogonal?
[19:25:04] <rpav> saying `inline` to actually-inlining
[19:25:11] <PJBoy> it's not though
[19:25:28] <rpav> it is neither necessary nor sufficient
[19:25:32] <Juliu> sprout, they would of course go to each cpp file that includes this header
[19:25:45] <PJBoy> it makes a difference to this codegen https://godbolt.org/z/bfcE4eEP3
[19:25:48] <sprout> right,  which would be problematic
[19:26:08] <Juliu> sprout, not really. But having larger functions in your header file is ugly anyway
[19:26:08] <rpav> PJBoy: but what compilers do is unspecified
[19:26:23] <PJBoy> this is #c++-general
[19:26:27] <Juliu> I mean, the whole concept of header files is ugly. But that's a different topic
[19:26:30] <rpav> i _have_ seen inline make a difference and make some bigger functions inlined, but that's not guaranteed
[19:26:57] <LordKalma> again, seems like having a nuanced understanding of a feature is too much to ask. Seems that nuanced discussion of anything is too much to ask these days anyway hahah
[19:26:58] <PJBoy> and what GCC does is somewhat specified
[19:27:05] <PJBoy> by their docs
[19:27:08] <rpav> thus discussing libraries and compilers is topical, but that doesn't make something standard-specific suddenly outside-the-standard
[19:27:20] <sprout> Juliu: yah.  I am moving header-only though for a small project while pending modules.
[19:27:33] <PJBoy> no one claimed the standard requires GCC to acknowledge inline for codegen purposes
[19:27:35] <lh_mouse> PJBoy, I happen to have an explanation about `inline` here: https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/mailman/message/37319453/
[19:27:36] <sprout> Juliu: closest I can get to complete single modules
[19:27:45] <LordKalma> in the standard sense the consequence of "inline" specifier is: "compiler, you'll see this symbol in many TUs. I promisse they are equal, don't freak out"
[19:27:58] <lh_mouse> AFAICT c++ `inline` should be equivalent to `extern
[19:27:58] <lh_mouse> __inline__ __attribute__((__weak__))` on Linux.
[19:28:05] <Juliu> sprout, not what I meant. I like header-only. But in general the concept of having a language that has header files in the first place is not good
[19:28:11] <LordKalma> in the pragmatic sense, as a programmer, it means "hey, compiler, watch this on all your TUs, and feel free to use that knowledge to optimize"
[19:28:13] <PJBoy> I don't know what any of those python keywords do
[19:28:14] <lh_mouse> On Windows we have `.linkonce` but it's more or less equivalent.
[19:28:46] <sprout> Juliu: oh sure,  I get that and agree.  just commenting on a recent thing I decided upon
[19:29:07] <lh_mouse> the C99 `inline` and `extern inline` have totally different semantics, while in C++ they are the same.
[19:29:13] <LordKalma> Juliu, what, you mean the separate compilation is shit? :o can't believe it
[19:29:26] <Juliu> sprout, I personally wouldn't put larger functions into header files. Although I like Eigen3 for example, a library that is completely headers only
[19:29:46] <PJBoy> that page claims that C's inline doesn't generate a function in codegen
[19:29:57] <LordKalma> isn't a library like Eigen3 mostly templates anyway?
[19:30:03] <LordKalma> maybe except for hand-written simd
[19:30:03] <sprout> Juliu: with classes it all becomes vague anyway
[19:30:17] <lh_mouse> C99 plain `inline` provides only the inline definition (so failure to inline the function ends up in undefined references), but `extern inline` provides a strong symbol (so if the function is declared `extern inline` in multiple TUs there could be multiple definitions).
[19:30:21] <Juliu> LordKalma, I mean that hand-crafting interfaces for your functions and classes is dumb, since a compiler can do that automaically. Java for example does that
[19:31:00] <sprout> Juliu: sure,  separating interface and implementation has always been seen as a good se practice.  but nobody really likes the overhead
[19:31:11] <lh_mouse> C++ solves this problem by providing weak symbols for `inline` functions (and implicit template specializations FWIW), so life has become simpler.
[19:31:15] * sprout *coughs* java
[19:31:28] <PJBoy> alright yeah, the C one is a bit different
[19:31:32] <PJBoy> cppreference confirms
[19:31:33] <LordKalma> C++ is old as fuck and is a mix of Simula, Algol, and C, on a C-ish interface, with god knows how many psycadelic drugs in the middle

[19:32:31] <LordKalma> C is a barebones language... by no means simple
[19:32:36] <Juliu> sprout, interfaces are defined by the implementations. It's the first line of each function :D So there is zero need to have the same code in a header file a second time. Actually, you might not even want anyone to have the change to modify a header (in cases those exist). Maybe you just want to give them your compiled code and a html file that describes the interfaces
[19:32:59] <lh_mouse> C is such a simple language that humans have to deal with the extra complexity.
[19:33:22] <LordKalma> C programmers say every experienced C programmer could write a C compiler as a "feature" of the language

[19:36:20] <Juliu> markand, it takes some common sense, indeed
[19:36:33] <LordKalma> Juliu, I don't agree with that. I don't mean, of course, that features should be used for the sake of being used.
[19:36:36] <markand> C is simple as it's easy to implement and remember, simple to use, yes but only after you've hit the most common mistakes
[19:36:39] <LordKalma> I mean they should be leveraged
[19:36:43] <LordKalma> instead of reinventing the wheel
[19:36:46] <rpav> PJBoy: quite the opposite; the ones who want a small stdlib are the ones that _make_ it do everything poorly
[19:36:52] <PJBoy> C is most certainly not simple and easy to implement
[19:36:58] <PJBoy> just look at the inline keyword
[19:37:11] <rpav> one should have an stdlib that does all the _common_ things well, even if it excludes some reasonable but uncommon things
[19:37:25] <PJBoy> I've been using C for ages and I'm still finding all these gotchas in the nooks and crannies
[19:37:48] <markand> writing a C compiler is order of magnitude easier than writing a C++ one
[19:37:52] <PJBoy> C is deceptive
[19:37:55] <rpav> rather than make a useless std because it absolutely must hypothetically handle the case that one guy in antarctica thought about using once
[19:37:55] <Juliu> LordKalma, have you ever tried a map editor for a 3D engine/game? You learn to make different kinds of doors quite in the beginning, and then you use them all over your first levels. But does a level with 10 different kinds of door really make sense? To me it's a sign of immaturity to not discipline yourself
[19:38:06] <PJBoy> C++ is probably more complex, not denying that
[19:38:23] <LordKalma> like, for example, let's make a comparison every C programmer loves to make: operator overloading. do I want my_thing_add(a, b) or a+b? The latter allows really easily to have code that's more "changeable", where you can change types with less find/replace
[19:38:32] <LordKalma> Juliu, yes, but I'm *not* saying that
[19:38:36] <PJBoy> but both languages are a hell of a lot more complex than lua

[19:57:04] <PJBoy> oh yeah that's a good point
[19:57:13] <Juliu> Python is shit for larger projects anyway
[19:57:14] <PJBoy> classic python
[19:57:22] <PJBoy> deferring errors to runtime
[19:57:50] <LordKalma> basically you have to trust you didn't make a typo on the named of the elements in the .ui file hahah
[19:57:54] <LordKalma> *names
[19:57:54] <Haohmaru> JIT errors
[19:57:55] <Juliu> LordKalma, I had no problems with Qt. But somehow I never couldn't imagine a real software company writing a larger application with it
[19:58:28] <LordKalma> there are large software stacks written with Qt. It's just that Qt... Man, don't get me started
[19:58:36] <LordKalma> I can rant all afternoon, and Alipha will ignore me :(

[19:59:02] <Juliu> LordKalma, if you load things from a .ui file in C++ and do not use the automatically created files from Qt-Designer, you also have to pay attention and make no typo
[19:59:16] <sigma_> hi , i have bug: else{ function(); return;} error_massage(); . if exit from else we have error but some time function has been called but return not worked and i get error you can say why?
[19:59:27] <Juliu> LordKalma, that's the point. I do not know a single software that uses Qt
[19:59:36] <LordKalma> I do
[19:59:40] <LordKalma> you do too
[19:59:48] <LordKalma> VLC, OBS come to mind quickly
[20:00:06] <Haohmaru> there's tons of cue-tea programs
[20:00:09] <LordKalma> VLC is an interesting one because while the UI is all Qt, the video window and audio is all custom in libvlc
[20:00:29] <Juliu> sigma_, I doubt that
[20:00:41] <LordKalma> the video bits on VLC are just a canvas for all Qt knows
[20:00:44] *** Joins: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus)
[20:01:11] <Juliu> sigma_, it's more likely you execute your code several times and the function call is NOT from the same execution than your error message
[20:02:29] <Juliu> Haohmaru, name a famous application that uses Qt ! I mean, to make it more easy: Does Qt-Designer even use Qt ?
[20:02:35] <LordKalma> yes, of course
[20:02:43] <Juliu> Why of course?
[20:02:48] <LordKalma> Juliu, plus, all the KDE stack is Qt
[20:03:02] <Juliu> LordKalma, linux, boo
[20:03:28] <Haohmaru> Juliu no idea about cue-tea-designer.. librecad, qpdfview
[20:03:41] <LordKalma> but the Qt company is quite focused on the embedded market for quite a while now
[20:03:49] <Haohmaru> wait, "famous"
[20:03:53] <Juliu> Wouldn't it be funny if Qt-Designer itself would not use Qt for the GUI ?
[20:03:53] <PJBoy> that's how my windows api + direct2d works too
[20:04:12] <PJBoy> I make a generic child window and direct2d draws onto it
[20:04:23] <PJBoy> windows has no idea what's going on in that canvas
[20:04:31] <kalven> https://resources.qt.io/customer-cases
[20:04:32] <LordKalma> Juliu, if you want to know, Qt has an "official" AUI API for docking windows but it's so shit Qt Creator used a third party library haha
[20:04:35] <Haohmaru> seems adobe, autodesk, among others are using it
[20:04:54] <Juliu> LordKalma, they worked together with Microsoft and Nokia on Windows phones ... until this was stopped
[20:04:56] <Haohmaru> Juliu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)#Qt_in_use
[20:05:19] <Juliu> LordKalma, as I said, I've used Qt myself for projects

[20:06:47] <LordKalma> yes, Qt is plenty shit, everything else is worse

[20:07:21] <PJBoy> GUI is too much work even for insane private source companies
[20:07:22] <Juliu> I always wondered that C++ does not natively have something for GUIs
[20:07:22] <cbreak> I see Qt software quite a bit, for software thats's expensive.
[20:07:24] <LordKalma> Or if you're windows only, use C#
[20:07:26] <rpav> unfortunate dirty-reality
[20:08:02] <LordKalma> Juliu, it's very hard to do x--platform guis
[20:08:03] <PJBoy> although we do have an insane private source GUI in my workplace
[20:08:06] <cbreak> Juliu: GUIs are a hard problem.
[20:08:08] <LordKalma> almost impossible really
[20:08:10] <LordKalma> yap
[20:08:28] <Juliu> cbreak, not really. Actually they should be quite easy. But apparently that's all so fucked up
[20:08:31] <LordKalma> the growing C# frameworks for x-platform GUIs basically use SKIA or something like that to draw on canvas
[20:08:32] <Haohmaru> UIs gets way too much into the human "taste"
[20:08:33] <PJBoy> unfortunately taking inspiration from MFC
[20:08:41] <kalven> :~)
[20:08:45] <PJBoy> I'm gonna destroy skia
[20:09:10] <LordKalma> actually some libraries like Uno platform are quite smart
[20:09:12] <Juliu> Haohmaru, what do you mean?
[20:09:18] <LordKalma> in the platforms that provide it, it uses "templated controls"
[20:09:26] <LordKalma> that means the buttons are real OS buttons
[20:09:35] <Haohmaru> Juliu people won't ever agree on the same thing
[20:09:37] <LordKalma> just rendered with whatever the framework rendered them with
[20:09:44] <PJBoy> I'm honestly surprised how many GUIs reinvent all the controls
[20:09:45] <LordKalma> while Qt is full on faking it
[20:09:45] <Haohmaru> how should a button look like?
[20:10:01] <Juliu> Haohmaru, they could simply have some kind of virtual machine running on every system for GUIs
[20:10:13] <kalven> "simply"
[20:10:37] <LordKalma> that's called Java
[20:10:39] <LordKalma> and still shit
[20:10:44] <Haohmaru> Juliu then someone will write a native GUI lib and someone else is gonna say "hah, you loosers, that lib is way faster"
[20:10:50] <Juliu> Common, buttons are buttons, windows are windows. There is actually not much to it
[20:11:05] <Haohmaru> sure there is
[20:11:07] <LordKalma> says the person with clearly no disabilities
[20:11:18] <Juliu> Haohmaru, is that why Java runs on millions of devices?
[20:11:18] <cbreak> if you want native look, then you better support the different button styles on MacOS
[20:11:31] <LordKalma> that's why templated or native controls are so important
[20:11:36] <Haohmaru> what dafuq do i know about java?!
[20:11:45] <cbreak> if you don't want native look, then you've just given up on solving one of the hard problems in cross-platform UI
[20:11:59] <Haohmaru> ^ what cbreak talks
[20:12:13] <Juliu> LordKalma, the disability helpers are part of the OS and work on every GUI, I suppose
[20:12:40] <rpav> and no one cares about native look anymore
[20:12:45] <Haohmaru> Juliu but you proposed to "just use some VM"
[20:12:47] <LordKalma> they do IF you use the native controls/templated controls from the OS
[20:12:50] <LordKalma> exactly
[20:12:51] <Juliu> cbreak, why would you not be able to get a native look just because it's cross platform
[20:13:15] <Haohmaru> Juliu look at cue-tea vs wxwidgets for example
[20:13:21] <Juliu> Haohmaru, doesn't have to be a real VM. Could be some kind of standard interface or whatever
[20:13:22] <cbreak> because native UIs have stupid ideas of how things should look like, which you either have to support, or ignore
[20:13:28] <LordKalma> wx wraps native controls when possible, Qt fakes everything
[20:13:29] <rpav> windows looks like all the things .. C#'s shit doesn't look "native", it looks much more "like a webpage" .. no one uses mac, and linux never really _had_ a native look, so
[20:14:05] <LordKalma> except if you're on Qt Quick. Then it's fuck all
[20:14:10] <Haohmaru> unfortunately, some folks use mac
[20:14:18] <rpav> in 2005 people cared about "native look" and then 15 years later, we have shit UI libraries and covid-19, so i'd say fuck those people and their native look
[20:14:33] <LordKalma> wtf is native look anyway? On windows particularly
[20:14:38] <PJBoy> C# stuff looks native
[20:14:40] <LordKalma> is it the winapi look, fluent design?
[20:14:41] <PJBoy> but doesn't act native
[20:14:42] <cbreak> windows has like 4 native looks.
[20:14:46] <Juliu> I hate applications that do not use the native Windows look. Everyone would be exactly the same, only look slightly different. Can't be that hard
[20:14:50] <LordKalma> or whatever win 11's guidelines are called?
[20:15:05] <Juliu> *Everything
[20:15:17] <rpav> windows "native look" is what you get when you open control panel or its dialogs mostly
[20:15:17] <LordKalma> cbreak, yes, winui, Fluent, whatever win11 has hahah
[20:15:19] <Haohmaru> https://www.pc-freak.net/images/windows-nmap-native-alternative-portqry-gui-ui-web-service-port-scan-screenshot.png
[20:15:24] <Shell> Juliu: yeah but every product manager wants their application to Stand Out so that customers Remember Them
[20:15:25] <rpav> win32 widgets
[20:15:41] <Juliu> LordKalma, the design can of course be modified in Windows, and the application shouold look accordingly. And not look the same all the time
[20:15:44] <LordKalma> win32 widgets is what I mean, not winui, sorry
[20:15:45] <Shell> the solution to this curse is to ban sales people
[20:15:50] <LordKalma> albeit winui is a wrapper for win32 ui
[20:16:05] <LordKalma> I want to write an application and I think I'll give up on having it look native as well
[20:16:05] <Juliu> Shell, yes. And I absolutely hate that. The best GUI elements are the native ones
[20:16:20] <Haohmaru> look at all the UI themes, every one has a "taste"
[20:16:26] <LordKalma> yah, true
[20:16:34] <Haohmaru> and still a ton of people ain't happy with their theme
[20:16:45] <Haohmaru> if they can, they will make more themes
[20:16:52] <cbreak> the true native windows look is the one you get in the old settings application, the new native windows look is the one you get in the new settings application
[20:16:55] <Haohmaru> when that's not enough - more theme engines
[20:17:01] <cbreak> and there are probably several in between
[20:17:11] <LordKalma> I was considering Avalonia or Uno Platform, but yeah, C# doesn't feel ready enough for good x-platform
[20:17:16] <LordKalma> so I'm back at looking at Qt...
[20:17:26] <Juliu> For example I'm currently using HexChat as IRC client on my Windows 7 system, and that looks perfectly natrive. So it can't be that hard, since I had HexChat on Linux as well
[20:17:37] <LordKalma> hahahahah hexchat is anything but native
[20:17:42] <LordKalma> I'm on hexchat, I know
[20:17:50] <LordKalma> hexchat is GTK, and a bad one
[20:17:55] <Juliu> LordKalma, it looks native to me
[20:18:14] <LordKalma> pretty bad eyesight then
[20:18:22] <Juliu> If you say so
[20:18:33] <PJBoy> native gui is whatever you can change with the theme dialog https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/media/public/2021/09/MCMW_Change%20colours%20in%20Windows%207_fig3a-2.png
[20:18:34] <Juliu> Close enough for my taste
[20:18:40] <kalven> you've likely used qt applications without knowing it too
[20:19:00] <Juliu> PJBoy, I agree
[20:19:06] <Haohmaru> it seems hexchat uses gtk
[20:19:11] <LordKalma> yes, I said that
[20:19:27] <Haohmaru> i was busy checking it
[20:19:33] <Juliu> LordKalma, whatever you say, my HexChat looks 100% native to me
[20:19:37] <LordKalma> rant #3: hexchat is shit. Every time I reboot the computer, the first time I use hexchat it fucks up the keyboard
[20:19:48] * Haohmaru gives Juliu some 'o-o'
[20:19:49] <LordKalma> it puts ~ instead of spaces, or whatever, it's random and different
[20:20:06] <Haohmaru> Juliu try mIRC
[20:20:13] <Haohmaru> that's native
[20:20:15] <PJBoy> speaking of which, I think they've removed that colour changer tool in windows now?
[20:20:27] <PJBoy> :<
[20:20:34] <Juliu> LordKalma, I just changed my design in Windows and all HexChat elements changed accordingly. Tell me again it doesn't look native
[20:21:03] <PJBoy> that means we have to edit the .theme files directly now
[20:21:11] <cbreak> hexchat looked terrible on KDE Plasma
[20:21:18] <cbreak> like one of those gnome applications...
[20:21:18] <sigma_> yeh
[20:21:23] <Haohmaru> KDE is terrible
[20:21:24] * Haohmaru runs
[20:21:28] <cbreak> using Konversation now, much better :)
[20:21:37] <Juliu> cbreak, I had Linux Mint before, and it looked good on there as well
[20:21:49] <LordKalma> https://i.gyazo.com/fb0bc600ab68d35b505dd151dee6b19a.png // subtle, but different
[20:21:58] <LordKalma> and MiKTeX uses Qt also anyway
[20:22:42] <cbreak> LordKalma: doesn't even have the same font sizes :)
[20:22:56] <sigma_> Haohmaru: hey men kde is almost perfect
[20:23:29] <Haohmaru> it's perfect when it's not installed on my PC
[20:23:33] <LordKalma> in fact, most GTK applications have obvious tells that you can pick up if you're used to them
[20:23:52] <LordKalma> cough inkscape cough
[20:24:03] <Haohmaru> aww, inkscape
[20:24:18] <cbreak> LordKalma: try gimp... looks so foreign :(
[20:24:27] <Juliu> Haohmaru, I swear that the HexChat on my Windows looks completely native to me
[20:24:39] <Haohmaru> pics or it didn't happen
[20:25:03] <Juliu> lol
[20:25:08] <LordKalma> https://i.gyazo.com/6bc814f2a7bd5925aea23ab1c40630a3.png // Inkscape really has *that* GTK look
[20:25:09] <Juliu> Pics are a scam
[20:25:46] <Haohmaru> but gimp is a specialized program, same for inkscape
[20:25:53] <PJBoy> https://superuser.com/questions/949920/window-color-and-appearance-removed-in-win10 confirmed removed that dialog :(
[20:25:53] <Haohmaru> it's artsy
[20:26:05] <PJBoy> guess even microsoft have given up on native GUI
[20:26:22] <LordKalma> PJBoy, they did. Look at .net MAUI (ALSO FUCK MS FOR STEALING THE MAUI NAME)
[20:26:33] <LordKalma> .net MAUI is MS doing skia hahah
[20:26:43] <PJBoy> :( :( :(
[20:26:59] <Juliu> The GIMP on my Windows system also looks 100% native
[20:27:00] <LordKalma> MAUI uses templated controls iirc, but not native renderes
[20:27:26] <sigma_> Haohmaru: i think you need try other desktop like cinnamon, it was trash. you say wow looks good but 2 min later your ram is full. in linux we have many ram problem on ui
[20:27:27] <PJBoy> GIMP looks fake as shit on mine
[20:27:34] <LordKalma> Juliu, you clearly have poor eyesight, go haave that checked. Or you're a very non-nuanced user
[20:27:37] <kalven> Juliu: ok, what's your point?
[20:27:43] <PJBoy> with its excessive padding in menus
[20:27:46] <Haohmaru> sigma_ i tried most of them.. lxde ftw
[20:28:01] <Juliu> LordKalma, nope, it uses the original Windows menus and buttons and everything, I swear
[20:28:04] <PJBoy> better than most C# apps I've used though
[20:28:08] <Haohmaru> Juliu this is made with wx, so it mostly looks native: https://i.imgur.com/xP5arcD.png
[20:28:12] <Haohmaru> (the IDE)
[20:28:13] <Juliu> kalven, nothing, just saying it looks native
[20:28:14] <LordKalma> Juliu, it doesn't, because it's GTK also iirc
[20:28:35] <Juliu> Haohmaru, yes, looks native
[20:28:37] <PJBoy> now wx looks native
[20:28:45] <PJBoy> for the most part
[20:28:50] <LordKalma> wx IS native
[20:28:53] <LordKalma> (for the most part)
[20:29:01] <LordKalma> wx only fakes controls that a platform doesn't have
[20:29:06] <Juliu> LordKalma, don't know. It looks native to me and behave native and even applies to whatever style I choose in Windows
[20:29:51] <cbreak> LordKalma: last time I checked, wx looked terribly out of place on MacOS
[20:29:59] <cbreak> all the distances between widgets were wrong
[20:30:08] <LordKalma> distances aren't the widgets per-se
[20:30:10] <cbreak> (this was a long time ago... I'd hope they fixed that by now)
[20:30:11] <Haohmaru> cbreak because there are nearly zero mac devs
[20:30:14] <LordKalma> and might use an old library also
[20:30:23] <LordKalma> the latest macos is cocoa or whatever?
[20:30:28] <LordKalma> *macos UI lib
[20:30:34] <cbreak> UIKit? I think?
[20:30:53] <cbreak> I don't really do UI if I can avoid it
[20:30:55] <Haohmaru> cbreak and probably because if you had paid for mac sh*t, you'd probably have money to pay for cue-tea license
[20:31:09] <sigma_> if we have problem in c++ ui , we can't use other language?
[20:31:10] <cbreak> Qt's free
[20:31:16] <PJBoy> mac is always gonna be the bastard child of cross platform
[20:31:20] <cbreak> sigma_: sure you can
[20:31:26] <cbreak> write a C++ library, use from where ever you want
[20:31:27] <Haohmaru> cbreak for closed-source too?
[20:31:37] <cbreak> Haohmaru: sure. As long as you're LGPL compatible
[20:31:46] <Haohmaru> right.. cue-tea.dll
[20:31:50] <Haohmaru> meh
[20:32:12] <Haohmaru> still, very very few mac devs
[20:32:17] <sigma_> so you can make ui with python but in back you are using c++ lib
[20:32:19] <LordKalma> PJBoy, .net MAUI supports macos, but not linux...
[20:32:26] <PJBoy> oh yeah hahaha
[20:32:40] <PJBoy> that's one of the weirder cases
[20:32:55] <cbreak> on linux... what would you even support?
[20:33:00] <cbreak> x11? wayland?
[20:33:04] <cbreak> or qt? gtk?
[20:33:09] <PJBoy> yeah
[20:33:10] <LordKalma> I think there are unofficial bindings for GTK
[20:33:10] <cbreak> or maybe libadwaita?
[20:33:14] <LordKalma> that might be upstreamed
[20:33:28] <LordKalma> xamarin.forms (.net MAUI's parent) had a GTK version
[20:33:32] <cbreak> or ... just start a web server on port 8888 and let the browser deal with it?

[20:45:13] <Haohmaru> the word "scam" is forbidden
[20:46:32] <sprout> gnome2 had a lot of pretty eye-candy at the end of that release
[20:46:39] <sprout> uh?
[20:47:03] <sigma_> that was a fact?
[20:47:05] <sprout> or was that gnome1? we're on 3 now right?
[20:47:10] <sprout> unsure
[20:47:32] <Haohmaru> the current gnome is ugly, i figured it aims to look like crApple UIs
[20:47:35] <Haohmaru> that explains it
[20:47:58] <sprout> yah sure,  wobbly windows flexing in all directions and all kinds of eye candy when switching desktops
[20:48:04] <sprout> kind-of miss that
[20:48:38] <Haohmaru> when i was young, i liked to pimp-up the UIs, customize everything..
[20:49:00] <Haohmaru> when you have to actually use the computer for a real purpose - most of that sh*t gets in the way
[20:49:16] <Haohmaru> thus i turn it all off and go for something sane, simple, and fast
[20:49:18] <sprout> my mac has some wobbliness it seems.  just checked
[20:49:20] <LordKalma> everything sucks
[20:49:34] <Haohmaru> especially KDE
[20:49:57] <LordKalma> I think I'll use Qt Quick...
[20:50:03] <Haohmaru> but i mean.. what sux a lot is those gtk3 scrollbars
[20:50:27] <Haohmaru> they made their way into lxde

[22:51:57] <sbrothy> Hi. I'm a little rusty so bear with me please. I guess this is really a compiler-related question but again.... If I include a bunch of headers via a precompiled header I don't actually need to link against the APIs unless I actually call them do I?
[22:55:58] <rpav> right
[22:56:20] <rpav> (assuming including the headers doesn't do something that requires linkage)
[22:57:36] <CarloWood> sbrothy: it is unrelated to being precompiled. If you just include all those same headers at the start of the current TU, that's the same.
[22:59:50] <CarloWood> And like rpav said, it will work until the linker complains that it can't find something, which is will only do if you include *code* that calls undefined functions or uses undefined global/external variables (ugh). So one or more headers would have to cause your exe to grow (by "generating" code).
[22:59:53] <sbrothy> ok forget the pch thingy. if i include, say boost/asio.hpp but don't use it, do I still have to link against boost?
[23:00:36] <rpav> no idea, consult its docs and/or try and see? ;)
[23:00:41] <CarloWood> That is usually unlikely - for a header - but theoretically you could have an inline function that calls external API, which for some reason is instantiated (as not inlined) without that you actually call it....
[23:00:43] <rpav> if it links you should be good right
[23:02:02] <CarloWood> I can imagine there are compiler/linker flags to get it to work if it doesn't work. But this isn't anything that is guaranteed by the C++ standard or something like that.
[23:02:48] *** Joins: AmR (~AmREiSa@41.36.185.103)
[23:03:07] <CarloWood> Ie, if your header contains:  void lib_API();  inline void f() { lib_API(); }  and you never call f(), then you might or might not get generated code for f() somewhere. If you do, then I think it won't link.
[23:03:55] <rpav> i don't think that's an issue, but if you physically make an object that references something requiring linkage there might be
[23:04:17] <rpav> `struct V { V(); }; struct S { static inline V; };` maybe
[23:04:24] <CarloWood> But I am pretty sure (seems very logical anyway) that there is some compiler flag to tell it to never instantiate a function that isn't called.
[23:05:21] <rpav> well it's more that the linker won't ever look for it, becuase it's never actually referenced .. i'm not 100% sure how that would work, but i'm not sure i'd be surprised either way
