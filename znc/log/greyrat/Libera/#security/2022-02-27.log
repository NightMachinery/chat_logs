[02:14:04] <velix> TimMc: Really? I thought pgp is state of the art?

[03:22:54] <james_s> for instance, not only are the backdoors supposedly there in some cases, like with Intel ME. but also with Intel ME, there was a secret way to disable it, supposedly used by the same people that created it. that's genius if you ask me.

[19:07:28] <velix> TimMc: When the DB with the encrypted data gets leaked and ONE single password was broken, all others are still safe.
[19:07:35] <velix> TimMc: security by insanity?
[19:07:43] <TimMc> There's no way to set it up so that users hold their own keys?
[19:08:46] <velix> TimMc: I need to acces the data ;)
[19:08:48] <velix> For sending bills etc.
[19:09:47] <TimMc> Could you have the client encrypt the data to two recipients, one being the user's own public key, and the other being your public key, which is then held somewhere other than the DB?
[19:10:25] <TimMc> Your admin process (running on a non-web-accessible host) could read from the DB and decrypt as needed.

[19:27:20] <velix> TimMc: Good idea! I'll setup postgresql to get the secrets from vaults
[19:27:51] <velix> TimMc: passwords? keys?
[19:27:55] <velix> Okay, let me explain the problem again.
[19:28:29] <velix> I'm getting first name, lastname, address and other stuff from Stripe. I need to store this data until the payment is completed and to write bills.
[19:28:53] <velix> I, of course, don't want to store those data in plaintext in DB, but want to encrypt them (not hash).
[19:29:15] <velix> So either I do this in the webhook, which receives the information using a public key or a symetrical one.
[19:29:30] <velix> Or I do it in PostgreSQL with some crude hacks.
[19:30:05] <velix> My idea was that each customer gets a unique secret to encrypt the data.
[19:30:16] <velix> but these secrets need to be stores anywhere. That's where Vault comes in.
[19:30:42] <velix> Actually it doesn't matter when the webstack is able to encrypt/decrypt. The secrets are stored in Vault.
[19:31:15] <velix> The webstack is in a read-only container without shell and running rootless. So it's about impossible for an intruder to do anything.

[19:45:31] <ajak> oh great, then you don't actually need to encrypt it anyway, if an attacker can't get to it

[20:04:09] <velix> wtf :D
[20:04:16] <MadCamel> heh I get it. Sounds like pci-dss requirements. Using Vault to hold a symetric key for each database row(user) will probably meet the requirement. Just do the crypto application-side
[20:04:31] <TimMc> velix: Technically you should store a sequence of keypairs -- encrypt to the first once, try decrypting with all of them. This allows for key rotations.
[20:04:44] <MadCamel> You'll have to keep some columns unencrypted or the application won't have anything to query in the db
[20:04:47] <TimMc> (This is really what I mean when I say "one keypair".)
[20:05:05] <TimMc> Key rotations allow you to limit impact of a breach.
[20:05:11] <TimMc> But one keypair per user? Probably not worth it.
[20:05:13] <velix> MadCamel: Sure, each customer has a pseudonym ID.
[20:05:20] <TimMc> Might as well just store the data in the Vault at that point.
[20:05:21] <velix> MadCamel: like `32i45h8fgjh3ijr`
[20:05:39] <velix> TimMc: Actually that's the manual way before Vault ;)
[20:05:57] <velix> 1 year ago, some gus in here told me: "Just use Vault to store your secrets".
[20:06:15] <velix> TimMc: On Github you can find many "DIY vaults" like the one you described.
[20:06:23] <MadCamel> you'll have a really good audit trail about what data is accessed haha

[20:07:29] <velix> Why is this so hard to get?
[20:07:46] <velix> When doing some work on the table, I don't want to see names, addresses etc.
[20:08:06] <velix> Also when someone likes a dump, nobody can do anything with encrypted data.
