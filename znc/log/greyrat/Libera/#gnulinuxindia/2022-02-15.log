[09:27:01] <gtlsgamr> looks like apple music
[09:33:30] <iamak[m]> Does anyone know where do the fem boy Linux user memes originate from? 
[09:33:38] <iamak[m]> 60% of the memes on r/linuxmemes are that only
[09:33:41] <gtlsgamr> https://learnbchs.org/
[09:33:47] <gtlsgamr> iamak[m]: that's a 4chan thing
[09:33:55] <gtlsgamr> https://learnbchs.org/ <-- this looks interesting
[09:34:24] <iamak[m]> gtlsgamr: Ah ok
[09:34:44] <iamak[m]> I guess I'll be unsubbing r/linuxmemes :/
[09:35:13] <gtlsgamr> why
[09:36:12] <iamak[m]> As I said most of the memes are Linux femboy memes. It used to be funny in the beginning but it's the same meme with a reskin nowadays
[09:37:20] <iamak[m]> They aren't "linux" memes now
[09:38:19] <Abhi[m]12> <dakship[m]> "nice, which app is that btw?" <- Apple Music .

[10:41:44] <Abhi[m]12> Itâ€™s electron based
[10:44:42] <NeoVoid[m]1> Any thought about this browser?
[10:44:46] <Abhi[m]12> Chromium based ?

[12:14:38] <Tor[m]> I think linux chads loved thigh highes and then started wearing in and turned in fems

[16:12:39] <gtlsgamr> Hi friends. --> https://hitarththummar.xyz/posts/blog/getting_tired_of_technology.html
[16:12:42] <gtlsgamr> new shit.
[18:00:15] <NeoVoid[m]1> <iamak[m]> "Lol why? I'm not a webdev but it..." <- I dont think I did config changes in dot but a week ago all the videos were playing nicely but suddenly they stopped.
[18:00:15] <NeoVoid[m]1> Then I installed plain firefox still no luck with odysee but youtube works. 
[18:00:15] <NeoVoid[m]1> however after that i applied arkenfox userscript in plain firefox hoping it would fix odysee but still no luck whatsoever.
[18:01:43] <gtlsgamr> for those that wanted to install ug-chromium but did not want to compile
[18:02:19] <gtlsgamr> you can now get it from openSUSE repos 
[18:02:19] <gtlsgamr> http://0x0.st/o8Tu.png
[18:02:36] <AryaK[m]> nice
[18:04:05] <gtlsgamr> so no more heavy compiling

[18:05:57] <iamak[m]> Is Odysee a Invidous instance?
[18:07:02] <AryaK[m]> no
[18:07:06] <AryaK[m]> absolutely not
[18:07:41] <Tor[m]> No
[18:07:56] <Tor[m]> It's own platform called lbry
[18:08:12] <Tor[m]> Also has it's own crypto to monetise
[18:09:38] <AryaK[m]> how to compile chromium extension
[18:09:42] <iamak[m]> Ah idk then
[18:10:46] <iamak[m]> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/part1-simple-extension
[18:10:46] <iamak[m]> Should be the same for Chromium
[18:11:25] <sla[m]12> <NeoVoid[m]1> "image.jpeg" <- 99.9 % udemy courses are bs, just read the man
