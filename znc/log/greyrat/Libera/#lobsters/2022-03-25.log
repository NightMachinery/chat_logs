[00:07:26] <iDrougge>  <river> reminder predictable network interface names
[00:08:06] <iDrougge> I remember writing to the NetBSD mailing list 20 years ago wondering why network interfaces were called ep and tl and eb.
[00:08:30] <cb> just in case you didn't know what was your tulip and what was your ne2000
[00:09:12] <iDrougge> ep was 3Com Etherlink III.
[00:09:28] <iDrougge> I think.
[00:09:44] <feoh> Oh WOW that's a blast from the past
[00:09:56] <feoh> Remember when 3Com nics were like EVERYWHERE?
[00:10:19] <iDrougge> Yes, almost as copious as NE2000.
[00:10:38] <feoh> AAAAH the Novell NE1000/2000!
[00:10:39] <iDrougge> Linux had the opposite problem; your network interface was called eth0 even when it wasn't ethernet.
[00:11:02] <feoh> It actually kind of bothers me that I have all this crap in my brain, yet can't remember what we're doing this weekend, much to my ever patient wife's dismay :)
[00:12:05] <feoh> But I worked at a networking company in the early 90s (NCM, spin off of Racal Interlan, we did network protocol co-processor cards. Turns out you can crush a 286 with network traffic so why not have a little 80186 CPU to handle the load? :)
[00:12:11] <iDrougge> Same here; that's why I never try to learn Unix command line things or if a specific function in Python uses camel case or kebab case and exactly how it is shortened.
[00:13:16] <feoh> OK now I'm trying to remember the name of the NIC Racal Interlan made that was kinda popular :)
[00:14:00] <feoh> NI6510
[00:14:02] <feoh> and friends
[00:14:37] <feoh> We supported every variant of SVR3 UNIX that existed at the time, including some REAL oddballs, oh and Coherent! :)

[00:30:05] <feoh> I keep thinking I should spin up a FreeBSD VM on ProxMox just to see how the other half lives, and then I get distracted with more productive fish to fry :)

[01:08:40] <technomancy> well that was fun; I think I bricked my chromebook
[01:09:01] <banna> it's a claybook now
[01:09:30] <technomancy> it failed at the first possible moment after the point of no return (wrote the partition table wiping out the old OS, but failed to create the filesystem inside the partition)
[01:12:29] <technomancy> I guess I could try ubuntu instead. I don't want ubuntu, but I also don't want a machine that doesn't have an OS.
[01:13:03] <river> i hope you can salvage it
[01:13:26] <technomancy> thanks

[01:17:40] <technomancy> pja: thanks, yeah but at this point if it's just going back to chromeos it's probably not worth the effort; I only use this machine for zoom (it has a glossy screen so it's not good for much else) and they are discontinuing support for zoom on it.

[01:19:55] <river> is it really that hard to just maximize firefox on a normal os
[01:20:09] <cb> it's the management stuff around it
[01:20:09] <technomancy> river: I actually originally got this specifically to put debian on it
[01:20:21] <technomancy> river: I just never got around to it once I realized how bad the display was
[01:21:28] <wink> river: I think it's a somehow logical conclusion of netbooks. a relatively cheap and light thing you can lug around and won't despair if it breaks or gets stolen, unlike a laptop for 1-2k bucks. or to watch stuff
[01:22:43] <wink> I often had an x230 on vacation just for sd card backups and because I hate working on my phone- and working includes research for stuff or writing blog posts...
[01:22:57] <wink> (not that I ever did work work on vacation, gladly)
[01:23:09] <bkero> X230 is best laptop.
[01:23:43] <wink> yeah it was fine in my backpack on a single trail, but I wouldn't have loved to have it during downhill
[01:24:09] <wink> not that I crash all the time, but ...
[01:24:17] <technomancy> bkero: didn't it have only 768 vertical resolution?
[01:25:54] <technomancy> the T60 with 1600x1200 was a legend
[01:26:46] <bkero> technomancy: Yes it did. nitrocaster came out with a board to retrofit 1080p screens.
[01:26:49] <pja> river: They’re great for non-techy people.
[01:27:11] <bkero> It only had single-link LVDS so the daughter board retrofit used one of the DisplayPort port pins from the dock connector.

[13:38:49] <river> im curious about the case where the numbers are equal and "it does not work"
[13:39:09] <river> what does it do instead? and does this mean compiling it to an xchg instruction is incorrect?
[13:40:22] <gerikson> wikipedia throws shade ``The algorithm is primarily a novelty and a way of demonstrating properties of the exclusive or operation. It is sometimes discussed as a program optimization, but there are almost no cases where swapping via exclusive or provides benefit over the standard, obvious technique.''
[13:43:26] <river> what is it they say.. shots fired
[13:44:13] <river> I have to agree this is a really stupid interview question

[22:36:32] <technomancy> I just installed ubuntu on this chromebook I have and the very first thing it asked me after I booted up was "hey do you want to sign in with your google account? or your microsoft account?" the hell.
[22:36:49] <drakonis> gnome
[22:37:04] <drakonis> you can skip that
[22:37:10] <jj5> bkero: negative, libusb-1.0-0 is there

[22:37:23] <jj5> the relevant package is 'nut'
[22:37:35] <drakonis> amazigh: give me a moment to sit down and get my thoughts in order
[22:37:44] <jj5> nut/focal,now 2.7.4-11ubuntu4 all [installed]
[22:37:45] <jj5>   network UPS tools - metapackage
[22:39:07] <technomancy> drakonis: I did skip it and declined like five more things, and then it was like "hey, want to install some software? how about like, discord? or slack?"
[22:40:02] <jj5> man the kernel is killing my `xz` process (out of memory) but there are 3GB RAM in buff/cache... how can I tell the kernel not to kill my xz..?
[22:40:34] <epilys> oom_score
[22:41:37] <drakonis> lol ubuntu
[22:42:01] <drakonis> fedora asks you if you want to enable extra repositories instead
[22:42:58] <bkero> oh yeah nut
[22:43:11] <bkero> jj5: also check to see if there was a config file change for nut, I think there was and you might have maintainer config
[22:43:19] <bkero> I've hacked on nut more than I care to admit.

[22:45:00] <drakonis> so, the rigidity comes from the execution and task model
[22:45:03] <amazigh> my hands on knowledge about nix and guix is a couple years old. Guix has not very friendly, some rought edges, and nix lang did not click on my side
[22:45:32] <amazigh> drakonis: you mean the fact that the nixstore is read-only?
[22:45:51] <drakonis> no
[22:46:07] <jj5> epilys: ooof. the kernel is killing my xz process before I can echo -100 > /proc/$PID/oom_score .. :(
[22:46:09] <amazigh> I let you write down your thoughts :)
[22:47:03] <epilys> jj5, make a shell script that does echo ... to oom_score_adj and then launchs your process
[22:47:16] <amazigh> (but now that I think again about it, I rarely touch ubuntu configuration, I just do apt install stuff...)
[22:47:46] <epilys> jj5, prepare for your system to completely block though just in case

[23:04:44] <jj5> epilys: so if I'm running a pipe line, e.g. `p-1 | p-2 &` and I use $! do I get the PID of the first process or the second? I'm using `echo -100 > /proc/$!/oom_score_adj` but that seems to be tracking the p-1 process not p-2 .. ? I am confused.

[23:46:41] <drakonis> amazigh: the traditional automation tooling typically use a playbook/cookbook that lays out the tasks that should be executed, said execution can be augmented by plugins, nix/guix do not provide that with equivalent ease, unless you consider deep diving into the guts to modify the behavior

[23:50:08] *** Joins: teasea (~teasea@user/teasea)
[23:51:01] <drakonis> nix and guix work inside their very specific model of declarative configuration and reproducibility
[23:52:01] <drakonis> it does not leave room to modify that
[23:52:21] <drakonis> if you wanted to include extra processing steps, it would be an uphill battle
[23:52:59] <drakonis> say you want to encrypt files for deploying on another machine and decrypt them there
[23:53:06] <companion_cube> I've been looking at mdn's resources on css and they're pretty nice
[23:53:11] <companion_cube> so the JS section should be good too, I imagine
[23:54:56] <drakonis> you probably could do this with the traditional tooling but it would also require effort
[23:55:40] <amazigh> ty
[23:56:09] <drakonis> i keep imagining a pipeline for my own project

[23:58:32] <drakonis> ha
[23:58:35] <drakonis> yes
[23:58:53] <amazigh> (the army of programmer explaning the success of tools is an unpopular opiniion)
[23:59:08] <drakonis> the established tooling works quite well and doesn't require changing your mindset
[23:59:16] <amazigh> drakonis: what is you project, you think you can define steps from the very beginning?
