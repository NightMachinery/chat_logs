[03:07:47] <muley> hey so I have a utility mysql server running (not critical) version 8.0.19, and someone here tried to setup replication on it. At this point, we have no slaves running, and I'm just trying to remove all replication settings now, but I can't seem to get this master to stop lol. I tried advice from here, but no luck... I noticed the thread is really old though. https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/21119/how-do-i-completely-disab

[04:54:40] <lsrtl_> thumbs, thumbs, I've checked docs on your proposal for using PITR for taking partial backup. It seems a bit overhead. Isn't it possible in case of a large table to backup 10 percent of record of it based on timestamp ?
[04:55:53] <thumbs> lsrtl_: no, but mysqldump can use a where clause
[04:56:11] <lsrtl_> so not to backup all the database. just all small volume tables as they are. Large tables - 10 % of their size
[04:57:14] <thumbs> you can use a WHERE clause to only select a given range of values
[05:05:57] <muley> thumbs: i ended up getting the master to stop by disabling binary logs altogether. i added "disable-log-bin" to my.cnf, restart mysql server, and that did it

[11:04:39] <k_sze> I don't know why I can never remember why `a left join b on a.col='bla' and a.b_id=b.id` is not what I want, that the a.col='bla' must be in the WHERE clause instead.
[11:05:41] <k_sze> I feel like I have many queries in my apps that are subtly broken because of this.
[11:06:29] <k_sze> Broken as in the queries will run but return the wrong results.
[11:08:29] <Naktibalda> if you add it to LEFT JOIN ON condition, you get all rows from table a, but you will get NULL for fields of b table if b record does not satisfy that condition
[11:09:00] <k_sze> Naktibalda, it's as though the a.col='bla' is completely ignored.
[11:09:21] <Naktibalda> no, it is not, it will have effect on those values, but it won't filter rows
[11:09:42] <Naktibalda> that's the point of LEFT JOIN
[11:10:27] <Naktibalda> you get data from a even if there is no matching data in b
[11:11:00] <k_sze> Right, it has an effect, but the effect is just... really weird.
[11:11:18] <k_sze> I don't even know how to describe the effect.
[11:16:09] <Naktibalda> it is called outer join
[11:16:34] <Naktibalda> so if you want to only get rows with 'bla', you put it in WHERE
[11:16:47] <Naktibalda> WHERE and ON is interchangable when you use INNER JOIN
[11:17:11] <Naktibalda> WHERE condition on b.col can turn LEFT JOIN to INNER JOIN

[23:32:41] <pi0> https://aggie.io/_99b9s6ctb here is my reasoning and illustration
[23:33:28] <pi0> i posted the question and drew an ER diagram based off what i understood it to be
[23:33:59] <pi0> i am questioning if i got the mandatory one to mandatory one part correct
[23:35:49] <Xgc> pi0: This doesn't look correct.  You have too many relationships/references defined.
[23:37:17] <pi0> oh no :/ ok let me break this one down a little
[23:37:30] <pi0> but have 3 entities would be correct?

[23:38:02] <Xgc> pi0: Sure.  But you'll have more tables.

[23:39:02] <pi0> hmm let me draw something on the board, give me one sec
[23:39:04] <Xgc> pi0: Your linkage between student / instructor doesn't exist, normally.  They are only indirectly related due to the other relationships.

[23:40:47] <pi0> but not sure if correct
[23:41:03] <pi0> shoot i did not mean well, but rather, could I say
[23:41:37] <Xgc> pi0: No students have no direct instructors.. students have courses which happen to be taught be some instructor.
[23:42:29] <pi0> ah
[23:42:39] <Xgc> pi0: There's no reason to link a student with an instructor, since that linkage can be derived by going through the courses we have registered.
[23:42:49] <pi0> ah
[23:42:53] <pi0> i see it
[23:42:54] <pi0> ok
[23:43:00] <pi0> let me fix this
[23:44:43] <pi0> making that connection right there, does that satisfy that "assume that each course is taught by only one instructor"
[23:44:58] <pi0> so that would mean, a mandatory one, in both directions?
[23:49:24] <pi0> does that connection make sense?
