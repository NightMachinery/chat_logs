[02:39:37] <MaxLeiter> oh, what i was trying to link before: github codespaces will let us have per-PR deployments of TL 
[02:39:44] <MaxLeiter> so you'll be able to test pull requests live in the browser 
[02:39:56] <MaxLeiter> just needs to go public
[03:24:38] <aab_> Very nice

[03:52:29] <bookworm> hm, you'll need to guard against the Bitcoin mining bots.... sr.ht had huge issues with their build service
[03:52:47] <bookworm> but that sounds great
[04:10:12] <Snuupy> cryptominer.js in thelounge frontend :D
[04:53:06] <MaxLeiter> thats githubs problem, not ours
[04:53:20] <MaxLeiter> (and is likely one reason codespaces are taking so long)
[04:53:36] <MaxLeiter> every free provider is having problems with it

[11:22:57] <aab_> People are sooo desperate to make money n cause havoc on other peoples lives itâ€™s unreal
[11:23:14] <aab_> would anyone like to stop earth I want to get off
[11:34:10] <bookworm> the scientist in my doesn't want earth to stop... gravity and seasons and stuff ;P
[11:34:14] <bookworm> me*
[11:41:30] <aab_> meh sod that just do it
[11:49:31] <fnutt> 393 in #thelounge @ Freenode. 341 in #thelounge @ Libera.
[11:49:52] <fnutt> Safe to assume there's a lot of users in both channels at the same time.
[11:50:22] <fnutt> If people that are in #thelounge @ Libera could leave the one at Freenode, THAT would be awesome.
[11:51:24] <aab_> updating my master docker images to v4.3.0-pre.2.
[12:01:27] <bookworm> fnutt: why do you care?
[12:04:10] <fnutt> I don't care that much, but it would be nice to get all the users over to our new channel though. :)
[12:05:06] <fnutt> I'm just curious about how many people are in both channels. I'm however not going to list, sort and diff the two user lists (takes too much time...).
[12:05:17] <bookworm> the ones that care are here already
[12:05:29] <bookworm> not like there's much going on in a moderated chan
[12:05:30] <fnutt> Sort of.
[12:05:54] <fnutt> There's still people on Freenode which I hope will join our new channel.
[12:05:59] <fnutt> E.g. minidigger.
[12:06:39] <aab_> just close the chan they will come over then ðŸŽˆ ðŸ¥³
[12:08:18] <bookworm> minidigger hasn't logged in to his account since a few weeks
[12:08:38] <bookworm> there's a minidigger3 in the chan, but not identified
[12:08:51] <bookworm> freenode that is

[12:13:55] <aab_> ping him n ask?
[12:14:49] <bookworm> ping a rando dude with a similar nick? ;P
[12:15:20] <bookworm> u less they are identified to services they aren't them... and with FN being FN I don't even trust that
[12:16:00] <aab_> well that's bizzare
[12:16:21] <aab_> maybe it is him but the client decided lets stick a 3 on the end
[12:16:23] <aab_> ha
[12:16:48] <bookworm> that's probably nick collision avoidance, or a protected nick can force it too
[12:17:05] <bookworm> services will boot you of my nick if Imznot around for instance
[12:17:07] <aab_> yes
[12:17:17] <bookworm> damned phone keyboard
[12:17:23] <aab_> right one moment need breakfast, 08:47 and on phones at 9:00
[12:27:31] <aab_> cuppa tea n some toast yum
[12:30:27] <aab_> now there's a feature i missed yesterday! screensharing via facetime
[12:30:35] <aab_> for technical support that's awesome!
[12:30:43] <bookworm> indeed
[12:30:50] *** Quits: iXNyNe (~NyNe@user/nyne) (Quit: iXNyNe)
[12:31:03] <bookworm> hm, can jitsi do that on mobile?
[12:31:07] <bookworm> never tried
[12:31:23] <aab_> it's a feature coming to facetime (screen sharing)
[12:31:35] <bookworm> yeah sure, I understood
[12:31:49] <aab_> 1 button screenshare
[12:32:02] <bookworm> I'm still wondering if other RTC applications can do it on mobile
[12:32:08] <bookworm> jitsi being one of them
[12:32:38] <aab_> never heard of that feature for other phones but I don't use anything apart from iphone, must have been a big request from users
[12:33:30] <bookworm> to be honest I don't see why this wasn't added earlier... graphics card not good enough to render video and do the actual screen work?
[12:33:49] <bookworm> I mean that's a normal feature on desktops for every video chat thing
[12:33:59] <bookworm> so why not do that on phones?
[12:34:11] <bookworm> and this isn't me blaming apple, generally curious
[12:34:44] <bookworm> googles whatever it called v3 of their facetime thing didn't / doesn't have it either I think... then again I don't use it
[12:35:23] <bookworm> allo? Duo? One of them
[12:35:28] <aab_> I'm not sure why from a support point of view it wasn't something first decided indeed it should have been though
[12:35:32] <bookworm> u less they killed them off to by now
[12:35:44] <bookworm> unless*
[12:36:03] <aab_> to be fair it could have been an option across all devices really
[12:36:22] <aab_> i know for windows microsoft does something now where you can put a pin in and it just connects
[12:36:42] <aab_> it's called quick assist on windows 10
[12:36:59] <bookworm> discovery via phone numbers is best from a usability perspective
[12:37:23] <bookworm> although many privacy conscious users tend to disagree
[12:38:04] <aab_> there's a lot of stuff they could do they probably just trying to find the best way every time inc testing
[12:38:05] <bookworm> after all look at telegram / ichat whatever... literally 0 setup
[12:38:31] <aab_> indeed
[12:43:59] <aab_> can anyone speak language? lol
[12:46:24] <bookworm> well, language barriers are a thing, no need to mock them
[12:46:33] <bookworm> I'm fairly sure you can't speak their native tongue either
[12:46:45] <bookworm> Oder schuesch choei mer o mini Sprach rede, ke Sach
[12:46:50] <bookworm> :) just saying
[12:48:41] <aab_> I can't speak any language at all including English at times lol hence why I I said can anyone speak language it wasn't mocking them
