[00:23:43] <JollyRgrs> ?
[00:24:04] <catbeard> 30m ago
[00:24:10] <JollyRgrs> what?
[00:24:24] <catbeard> oh wait do you have access to sd
[00:24:29] <catbeard> or is that mistiry 
[00:24:35] <JollyRgrs> what about sd?
[00:24:38] <JollyRgrs> and no, that's bloody
[00:24:52] <JollyRgrs> but that's how IRC works. we don't WANT their flood of crap anyways
[00:24:56] <JollyRgrs> why would we want to fix that?
[00:25:22] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> i fall afoul of that alo massacre
[00:25:27] <catbeard> so @massacre#dunnohisdiscordid - i'm saying if there's multiple lines of code in the output going into the irc bridge, then it could be pasted instead of flooded
[00:25:44] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> apprently discord bots have trouble with the irc bridge
[00:25:58] <mistiry> there isnt a fix afaik, its flood control built into the bot code
[00:26:04] <catbeard> or rather, multiple messages
[00:26:05] <mistiry> feature, not a bug
[00:26:08] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> rest of the channels go nuts just dont doit here even if its too another discord user
[00:26:16] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> irc users are scared of our swagger üòâ
[00:26:20] <catbeard> mistiry: yeah easily solved but at the cost of delaying reception of messages here
[00:26:32] <catbeard> or transmission
[00:26:42] <mistiry> right, bot is open source, we could modify the code and im sure get it to relay huge pastes like that
[00:26:47] <mistiry> but that would not be good
[00:26:53] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[00:26:59] <CptLuxx> no
[00:27:00] <mistiry> even in a busy active discord channel, its bad form to paste huge code blocks
[00:27:04] <CptLuxx> let the discord user use pastebin
[00:27:08] <CptLuxx> or are they to stupid for it?
[00:27:10] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> techinaly all you need to search for is "```"
[00:27:21] <JollyRgrs> we don't WANT the flood
[00:27:25] <JollyRgrs> what don't you understand?
[00:27:27] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> no we have a conviant intergrated tool captain
[00:27:31] <JollyRgrs> it isn't that it is hard or not, we don't want it
[00:27:32] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> *convient
[00:27:40] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> like we have code markup nativly for discord
[00:27:50] <mistiry> im aware
[00:27:53] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> so we often use the ingergrated markup rather than go to external tools
[00:27:54] <mistiry> as are most of us
[00:28:08] <mistiry> i use discord every day. im aware of its features.
[00:28:08] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> mainly that was apimed at cptluxx
[00:28:19] <JollyRgrs> mistiry hit it on the head. even in discord, you don't want to have to keep scrolling back to reference a huge code block
[00:28:23] <mistiry> right
[00:28:39] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> i mean we use the inbuilt search tools
[00:28:41] <mistiry> its rude to monopolize the chat with your huge pastes just to ask "why doesnt this work"
[00:28:43] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> so ü§∑
[00:28:56] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> post it in scripting buddy
[00:29:03] <JollyRgrs> what does inbuilt search have to do with referencing a code block?
[00:29:15] <JollyRgrs> if i do that, i can't read the current chat and type at the same time
[00:29:24] <JollyRgrs> but i can pull up a pastebin of code in another window completely
[00:29:26] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> incase i am looking for something someones posted
[00:29:44] <JollyRgrs> weechat has built-in search functions, too
[00:29:45] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> i mean i can also push it to my github
[00:29:50] <JollyRgrs> and on top of that, i can just grep my entire irc log
[00:29:53] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> so whats your point on that
[00:30:07] <catbeard> tidies things up and links them for later analysis
[00:30:13] <JollyRgrs> my point is that when posting a huge chunk of code and asking for help, it is better to pastebin it and reference that
[00:30:25] <JollyRgrs> no matter the chat platform
[00:30:29] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> depends what your nitro is on discord üòâ
[00:30:42] <JollyRgrs> ... wut?
[00:30:44] <catbeard> yeah and discord is more mainstream i'd think so someone might be noobish enough to paste gobs of code
[00:30:54] <JollyRgrs> nitro doesn't make your screen 2million lines tall
[00:30:55] <catbeard> or like command output
[00:30:57] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> and like i said it uses same markup as vs code
[00:31:03] <mistiry> no. in a chat room (any platform) that has hundreds of users and possibly multiple convos going at the same time, pasting 50+ lines is annoying af
[00:31:11] <mistiry> "same as vscode" 
[00:31:11] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> so you can easily read code without going external
[00:31:13] <mistiry> you mean markdownm
[00:31:15] <mistiry> lmao
[00:31:21] <catbeard> but this way it can be flood controlled (x messages per y seconds)
[00:31:25] <mistiry> its not a quesiton of readability
[00:31:28] <catbeard> and privately pastebin'd
[00:31:29] <JollyRgrs> same as vs code? lololololololol
[00:31:41] <mistiry> yes, it makes it readable. that isnt the problem
[00:31:50] <catbeard> and forwarded as message from the discord handle through sd with link formatted
[00:32:00] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> you use a diff ide than visual studio(code or pro) these days?
[00:32:03] <mistiry> again - imagine in the middle of this converssation someone pastes a 100 line blob of code and goes "whats wrong"?
[00:32:16] <mistiry> derails everything
[00:32:20] <catbeard> mistiry: yes tell me IMMEDIATELY what is wrong with this code fix it
[00:32:22] <catbeard> lol
[00:32:24] <mistiry> right
[00:32:28] <mistiry> its fucking annoying
[00:32:31] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> regularly deal with that every day in other discords
[00:32:34] <mistiry> pastebin and link it
[00:32:40] <catbeard> like first k lemme awk the code from my logs
[00:32:42] <mistiry> @Hotmess and its annoying there too
[00:32:55] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> not for everyone that deals with it there
[00:33:07] <mistiry> this isnt even a scripting or programming channel
[00:33:08] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> java discord being a good example
[00:33:37] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> its ontopic general right for sysadmins?
[00:33:56] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> what happens when you want a bash script to delte files or powershell to remove lisences from o365?
[00:34:06] <mistiry> paste us a link to it and we can look at it
[00:34:19] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> here i try to do that
[00:34:27] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> other channels you get the raw code
[00:34:38] <mistiry> sure. i never disagreed with that
[00:34:41] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> as quite often its out of my private repo
[00:34:47] <mistiry> that doesnt negate anything we said, though.
[00:34:56] <mistiry> i dont know how to explain it any clearer
[00:35:34] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> well whathappens is you run into a discord user doing the things they do always on refelex
[00:35:34] <mistiry> in a chat room that has hundreds of users, and possibly several conversations actively going at a time, it is a major derail to the conversation to have the entire scrollback get filled up with someone's code block.
[00:35:40] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> and pissing off the irc users
[00:35:55] <JollyRgrs> nah, doesn't piss us off too much b/c IRC has flood control
[00:35:59] <mistiry> i dont like it in Discord either
[00:36:03] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[00:36:05] <mistiry> its not an IRC vs Discord thing
[00:36:12] <JollyRgrs> he still thinks we don't use discord, lol
[00:36:13] <mistiry> why is that hard to understand
[00:36:36] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> hoenstly ive not encountered other ppl having isues with it in other discord server
[00:36:38] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> just here
[00:36:49] <JollyRgrs> i prefer IRC for some things... for other things i prefer discord. yet others i only use discord b/c i have to, even though their audio functions are LITERALLY THE WORST
[00:37:03] <JollyRgrs> slower discord channels it is prob no big deal
[00:37:11] <JollyRgrs> and it depends on the length of the code
[00:37:20] <mistiry> right
[00:37:25] <mistiry> people have pasted 50+ lines in here
[00:37:25] <JollyRgrs> anything over 4-5 lines should def. be pastebinned
[00:37:48] <mistiry> regardless of platform, that is annoying, _especially_ when it interrupts one or more OTHER conversations going on
[00:38:10] <catbeard> to be fair if it's a dickbutt it's allows on irc
[00:38:24] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> or other ascii art
[00:39:00] <catbeard> but yeah code though like dood pastebin so i can copy into my ide and run it blindly!
[00:39:47] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> or send ur vs code live share link üòâ
[00:40:27] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> that extension is pretty dope if you have never used it
[00:40:55] <catbeard> so the problem is that it would be have to be done per handle and applied towards a libera set global rate limit
[00:41:14] <catbeard> for e.g. max messages per user per minute
[00:41:26] <catbeard> so ozone doesn't come in here and murder it
[00:41:37] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare>
[00:41:49] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> for the next time you need to code with ppl
[00:42:22] <catbeard> and it would slow down the ingress of discord messages sent to irc as a bonus even without the pastebin time delay buffering
[00:42:27] <mistiry> the dickbutt/flooding is mostly relegated to evenings/weekends (US time), and many times is used to clear the scrollback or to interrupt an argument or troll. but yeah, theres like 10 years of tradition behind that.
[00:42:28] <catbeard> üëç 
[00:43:40] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> JollyRgrs: how do you configure flood control?
[00:43:42] <DrZak> :)
[00:43:48] <DrZak> its weak
[00:43:50] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> do you just not see the flooding at all?
[00:44:05] <DrZak> the multicolored italian CiAo Di TuTTi is from 199x
[00:44:17] <DrZak> that's tradition!
[00:44:44] <catbeard> unless there's extra configurations for slow mode on discord server
[00:44:51] <JollyRgrs> @sysadmin it's built-in, I guess depending on the IRC network's settings

[12:35:22] <yuken> and getting a silencer made for it.
[12:37:11] <SirSantalot> damn you and your ability to buy cool stuff like that
[12:37:31] <yuken> :P
[12:37:40] <SirSantalot> how much will both those things cost?
[12:37:49] <yuken> $1099 and probably $800.
[12:38:08] <ender> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29525286 Honestly, the Log4j maintainers would have been completely justified in saying, "hey, yeah, we see this critical vulnerability, but it's the weekend, we'll get to it on Monday."
[12:38:19] <SirSantalot> huh, ratio of rifle - silencer is not what I would have expected
[12:38:43] <yuken> SirSantalot, well the silencer material cost is like $30 at most, but I have to legally fill out a $200 "tax stamp", and then I don't have the machine tools to do it myself...
[12:39:11] <SirSantalot> ah
[12:39:23] <yuken> so I have to either "build" a silencer and have a licensed person redo the internals for me, or buy one.
[12:40:16] <yuken> SirSantalot, I might DIY the rifle though - cheap AK kits are still like $300, and I can get the tools to DIY it for a few hundred bucks. 
[12:40:20] <yuken> And then make more for cheap in the future.
[12:41:03] <SirSantalot> werent there some parts that need to be registered?
[12:41:07] <SirSantalot> the receiver?
[12:41:16] <yuken> No registration.
[12:41:43] <yuken> SirSantalot, basically - in order for a dealer to sell a firearm, they must do a background check. Private citizens do not need to do this. You can also _build_ a firearm (the receiver, legally) without registration or background checks, legally.
[12:42:07] <yuken> The illegal part is either selling firearms as a business without license, or building firearms for the purpose of sale/distribution without a license. But, if I just so happen to sell a homemade item down the road, that's also legal.
[12:42:26] <SirSantalot> lol
[12:42:37] <yuken> Like if I got on hard times and needed quick cash, or as a birthday gift for someone in the future, etc.

[13:51:46] <yuken> SirSantalot, see, I conceal carry. Except, the way I legally do it involves loopholes in my state law.
[13:51:51] <yuken> Loopholes that aren't obvious to people, including cops.

[13:56:02] <SirSantalot> yuken, I don't want to turn this into a first amendement debate, but if that's really an issue can't you just not carry a weapon? Or not conceal it if that's more plausible?

[13:57:11] <yuken> SirSantalot, the latter one? Technically it is more obviously legal, _BUT_ my state still prohibits transfers of handguns to <21, so to the untrained eye it looks illegal.

[14:07:36] <yuken> And teh_Gr1nch, these aren't legally firearms in the US: https://taylorsfirearms.com/hand-guns.html?cat=18
[14:07:44] <yuken> Meaning a toddler could mail-order one right now if they had $300.

[14:08:16] <sd> 14<P‚Äãhorcys> truly a Gorillaz moment
[14:08:23] <yuken> Antiques aren't legally controlled in the US, except in a few states.
[14:08:51] <teh_Gr1nch> yeah, I know you can own a cannon made before a certain year
[14:08:53] <sd> 14<P‚Äãhorcys> in france you just go in the hood for 1 night and that can buy you anything
[14:08:56] <yuken> ... sadly my state is one of them, which means I have to either deal with bullshit going to a dealer, or go outside of the state.
[14:09:00] <teh_Gr1nch> muzzle loaders mostly
[14:09:05] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, not "made before a certain year", cannons in general.
[14:09:44] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, basically, an antique is either a firearm that uses an antique firing system or a replica of an antique firing system (even modern designs), or any cartridge-loading firearm made before 1899 where ammo is no longer readily available and has not been converted as such.
[14:10:06] <yuken> So a cartridge-revolver in [wack-shit cartridge that nobody uses anymore] is an antique and not regulated. The same revolver in 45 Long Colt is regulated.
[14:10:15] <teh_Gr1nch> "made before 1899"
[14:10:17] <yuken> (if both made before 1899)
[14:10:32] <teh_Gr1nch>  not "made before a certain year"
[14:10:34] <teh_Gr1nch> pick 1 :D
[14:10:35] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, for cartridge-loaders. Separate ammo firearms basically aren't regulated at all.
[14:10:47] <yuken> If you load the powder and bullet separately, it's not regulated, as a TL;DR.
[14:11:52] <teh_Gr1nch> so you could own a breach loading howitzer provided you load the projectile and powder charge separately? doubt that
[14:12:17] <yuken> A howitzer is a cartridge-based firearm, innit? If so, no.
[14:12:22] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> we're talking guns again?
[14:12:24] <yuken> Oh, howitzer isn't even a specific firearm.
[14:12:34] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, yeah, you can.
[14:12:46] <teh_Gr1nch> a howitzer is a modern field artillery piece
[14:12:49] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, if you load the bullet and powder separately, _including_ breechloadermuzzleloaders, it's unregulated.
[14:13:05] <yuken> So long as the firearm was designed that way, or converted to only work that way.
[14:14:15] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, this also included autonomous systems, provided the above is true. So even if you had a way to automatically load balls and powder, it's still unregulated. IE. a powder chamber and some system to dispense a pre-determnied amount of powder, and a smoothbore where balls can just slide in.
[14:15:36] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, https://www.gunbroker.com/item/916924251 - so if you want to buy this r/n for example, it's considered the same as me buying a bag of chips.

[14:15:46] <yuken> lol
[14:16:10] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, note the "FFL not required" for shipping, as in, it doesn't need to be shipped to a dealer - because it's not a regulated item.
[14:16:10] <DoTheNeedful> s/does/dose
[14:16:11] <layer8> yuken meant: "teh_Gr1nch, note the "FFL not required" for shipping, as in, it dosen't need to be shipped to a dealer - because it's not a regulated item."

[14:17:18] <SirSantalot> did someone really make DoTheNeedful correct does to dose automatically?
[14:17:26] <yuken> does
[14:17:28] <yuken> dose
[14:17:44] <SirSantalot> there's only one explanation for it failing now
[14:17:45] <teh_Gr1nch> yes
[14:17:51] <SirSantalot> DoTheNeedful has become sentient
[14:18:13] <teh_Gr1nch> according to mistiry, it has a certain low % chance to trigger
[14:18:21] <teh_Gr1nch> something like 1%
[14:18:40] <yuken> teh_Gr1nch, here's a cartridge firing gun that's also considered an antique and can be mailed straight to you, as 32 Rimfire isn't really a thing anymore. https://www.gunbroker.com/item/913377968
[14:18:49] <yuken> And fun thing with antiques is that they're super easy to export from the US too.
[14:19:04] <teh_Gr1nch> it used to do it 100% of the time, but it got annoying really fast
[14:19:13] <yuken> ^
[14:21:00] <teh_Gr1nch> Occasionally, special limited runs of .32 rimfire ammunition are manufactured for gun collectors with shootable specimens, but the round is not considered a current commercial cartridge.
[14:21:13] <yuken> mhmm.
[14:21:34] <yuken> It's the "considered current cartridge" that's the big part.
[14:21:36] <teh_Gr1nch> well, yeah. you can't shoot anyone if you have no ammo :D
[14:21:51] <yuken> People make it themselves lol
[14:22:37] <yuken> Felons are also allowed to own and use, and even carry in some cases, antiques in many states due to low regulations.

[18:07:30] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Yea it seems like the wankers that drive like they have explosive diarrhea never have insurance. You'd figure if you were driving around without coverage you'd at least be careful.
[18:08:07] <Santax> You would think. Now I have to deal with it. Get a tail light replace and scratches removed/repaired/replaced. On my dime. 
[18:08:11] <Santax> It annoys me
[18:08:32] <Santax> And my truck has never been in an accident so now it's lost value. Sounds like a good time to sue for the lost time/money

[18:09:38] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Like I have under/no insurance coverage so if one of those types hits me my insurance will still handle it.
[18:09:41] <JollyRgrs> it should, but depending on the cost of the minimal damage, might not be worth a claim

[18:11:13] <Santax> JollyRgrs: if it's registered you say you have insurance at the motor vehicle office. you sign a form. 
[18:11:20] <Santax> so not only is the driver at fault the owner is as well.

[21:09:40] <rpifan> it has worked incredibly well for me
[21:09:52] <rpifan> with the exception that my hair line is super high so everyone thinks im 40 even tho im not evenclose to that
[21:09:57] <rpifan> but ill get a second transplant this year to fix that
[21:10:08] <rpifan> what it wont fix of course is the grey hair but w/e grey is better then nothing
[21:10:11] <vinrock> nah i accept being bald
[21:10:15] <vinrock> i knew i would be when i was a kid
[21:10:18] <vinrock> my moms dad was bald
[21:10:29] <rpifan> so did i
[21:10:35] <vinrock> the only thing ill do is if one day theres a pill that just gives you back all your hair
[21:10:35] <rpifan> hence why i had really long rockstar hair
[21:10:36] <vinrock> ill take the pill
[21:10:41] <vinrock> and then ill grow an afro

[21:10:48] <rpifan> when i still had hair
[21:10:57] <vinrock> i had long hair also

[23:29:48] <SantasWiFi> like 1/5 users who reset their passwords will have this happen
[23:30:54] <sideup66> SantasWiFi: <3 how you man
[23:30:54] <sd> 09<Q‚Äãuasky> May I suggest, the nuclear option.
[23:30:56] <sd> 09<Q‚Äãuasky> Just becuase
[23:31:28] <SantasWiFi> sideup66: doing good brutha!
[23:31:36] <SantasWiFi> its happening on multiple users though :(
[23:31:36] <sideup66> good to hear! hanging in here
[23:31:44] <SantasWiFi> don't wanna nuke a bunch of machines xD
[23:31:49] <SantasWiFi> hangin sir!
[23:31:53] <SantasWiFi> community is pulling together
[23:31:59] <sideup66> in my experience when windows is this f*ed
[23:32:01] <sideup66> just nukeit
[23:32:04] <sideup66> not worth "fixing"
[23:32:06] <SantasWiFi> its not really winders though
[23:32:07] <sideup66> then it runs like crap
[23:32:09] <sideup66> then you have weird problems
[23:32:11] <sideup66> oh?
[23:32:19] <SantasWiFi> its just office doing it
[23:32:23] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> Just find a new job then leave it for the next guy
[23:32:27] <SantasWiFi> lol
[23:32:29] <sideup66> re push office?
[23:32:37] <SantasWiFi> im wondering if I've fucked up my office settings GPO or something
[23:32:46] <SantasWiFi> but no idea how I could possibly cuase it to stop updating the credntial entry in windows
[23:33:11] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> Is Office up to date?
[23:33:17] <SantasWiFi> yeah I think so
[23:33:21] <SantasWiFi> they all have the ugly ass outlook now lol
[23:33:38] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> Only thing I can think is it‚Äôs not prompting for auth when auth fails
[23:33:39] <SantasWiFi> I feel like this didn't start until 20H2 but I'm not sure yet
[23:33:42] <SantasWiFi> gonna keep digging
[23:33:45] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> But idk why that‚Äôs happen
[23:33:55] <SantasWiFi> I think its some AAD bullshit honestly
[23:34:19] <SantasWiFi> lemme check my AAD logs
[23:34:28] <SantaWasTaken> SantasWiFi: have you tried saving a full copy of AD and user paswords in each computers Windows Credential Manager?
[23:34:35] <SantasWiFi> lol

[23:40:27] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> Anyone using Google for email for a domain and then using Outlook via IMAP with it?   I'm about to do it, but found some odd posts on Reddit saying it "isn't supported."  How is IMAP "not supported" between Outlook and Gsuite?
[23:43:02] <thegodsquirrel> something sounds fucky
[23:45:05] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> Actually, maybe I should just go with Rackspace or Protonmail.  They just want something as an IMAP mail provider for a few addresses -- and would prefer to not use Microsoft.
[23:46:41] <vinrock> why dont you want to use ms
[23:46:48] <vinrock> exchange online is like $4/mailbox/mo
[23:47:10] <vinrock> i imagine rackspace is $1,000,000/mailbox/mo
[23:47:12] <vinrock> or somewhere around there
[23:48:51] <SantasWiFi> gmail def supports IMAP
[23:49:07] <DrZak> what
[23:49:08] <DrZak> :)
[23:49:31] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> It does, but you have to enable less secure apps and, now and then, Google decides to turn that back off for you.  üôÇ
[23:49:55] <DrZak> yea, imap is great!!
[23:50:02] <DrZak> as are plaintext passwords
[23:50:05] <DrZak> is lovely!
[23:50:16] <DrZak> back to the 90ies
[23:50:16] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> Sorry, I should have clarified that this isn't for myself (who uses Exchange).  It is for a small company that, for their own reasons, doesn't want to use MS.  I know, it's dumb, but it is what it is.
[23:50:41] <DrZak> :)
[23:50:57] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> Rackspace is actually $3/user/month. For 25GB even.
[23:51:12] <DrZak> so, they pay for windows, office package, then per mailbox to a provider
[23:51:14] <vinrock> oh wow
[23:51:30] <sd> 12<h‚Äãxcsp> i migrated from rackspace to o365 at lastjob. rackspace sucks
[23:51:36] <sd> 12<h‚Äãxcsp> and their management of their "hosted exchange" sucks too
[23:51:43] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> No, they don't.  Not monthly, at least.  They have Windows and Office 2019.  Not 365.
[23:51:43] <vinrock> i just use rackspace for websites
[23:52:20] <sd> 12<h‚Äãxcsp> i cant attest to other rackspace services, but we had a horrible time with the exchange stuff.  and then the Rackspace O365 offering is like half of what is offered in regular o365
[23:52:21] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> Note that Rackspace has two email options -- one is Exchange based and the other is not.  So, I wouldn't be using their Exchange side if I did it with them.
[23:52:25] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> Might go with Fastmail though...
[23:52:34] <DrZak> yea, i mean, they pay for the licenses
[23:53:10] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> I don‚Äôt really get why people would use rackspace
[23:53:23] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> Is it cheaper?
[23:53:40] <sd> 14<J‚ÄãohnGypsy> If you just need IMAP, it's better than Zoho?  üôÇ
