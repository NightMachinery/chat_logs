[00:59:52] <rob0> rictoo: maybe?  Is the VPN server pushing --redirect-gateway, and is that not something you want (to route LAN clients through the VPN)?
[01:16:05] <rictoo> rob0, it's with pay-to-use VPN services - the reason i am "sharing" the two connections is because i have an openvpn server running on my Windows box and "Share" is the only way my client can get internet access when connected
[01:16:36] <rictoo> the question is regarding whether this "Share" is a security vulnerability when using my Windows box to connect to pay-to-use VPN services
[01:26:20] *** Quits: computerfarmer (~thomas@p200300ca073550bc9cb66e66060516f8.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:31:59] <Poster> It's not too much more of a vulnerability than sharing a broadband connection minus there being some potential bug in the OpenVPN client and/or server code
[01:33:14] <Poster> Past that it can go either way, understanding and accepting the implications of pushing all of your Internet traffic to a 3rd party may be a good or bad thing
[01:33:59] <rictoo> Poster, I am concerned of other clients who are using hte same VPN server being able to somehow access my LAN if i "share" the two connections
[01:34:01] <rictoo> is that realistic?
[01:35:14] <Poster> If you push routes to your home LAN, forward the traffic and do not apply network filtering to prevent it, sure, but that would be present without the pay-to-use VPN service
[01:35:56] <Poster> I mean one could add routes by hand to your home subnet if known
[01:36:41] <Poster> I know Windows is capable of IP routing, I am not sure what options are to filter traffic traversing it 
[01:36:52] <rictoo> yikes, that doesn't sound safe
[01:37:08] <Poster> I am not saying they don't exist, I am just not aware of them
[01:37:18] <rictoo> unfortunately this was the only way i could get my clients to use the VPN server's WAN connection
[01:37:42] <Poster> What is the original intention of the clients connecting in?
[01:37:44] <rictoo> rather, my one client (i am simply doing this to be able to access my home PC's network when away from home)
[01:39:08] <Poster> is your home connection unable to accept inbound traffic?
[01:39:50] <rictoo> once connected, i am able to ping the vpn server's internal ip (10.x.x.x), but pinging anything on the external web doesn't work
[01:40:14] <rictoo> unless i "share" my WAN and VPN devices on the server-side (running Windows)
[01:40:30] <rictoo> as in, link them up
[01:40:33] <Poster> it sounds like you're pushing a default route from the VPN server to the client, which may not be what you want
[01:40:43] <rictoo> apologies for the lack of networking terminology, i'm not super-well versed :P
[01:41:00] <Poster> no issue, we were all beginners at one time
[01:41:22] <Poster> so your goal is to have a home system connect to some Windows VPN server at a business so you could access your home network?
[01:41:57] <rictoo> the server _does_ say this once the client connects: " 'PUSH_REPLY,redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp,route 10.xx.0.1,topolo ..."
[01:42:26] <Poster> yeah your telling the connecting system to push all of it's non-local traffic to it, including the Internet
[01:42:36] <rictoo> the goal is to have my laptop connect to my home PC to be able to access my network, primarily for remote desktop-ing but also to access the web through it
[01:42:51] <rictoo> yes, i believe that is what i want
[01:44:06] <Poster> it sounds like you're routing your home PC to your business network, unless you have some type of filtering between the two bad things can jump from one to the other
[01:44:07] <rictoo> to be able to access my home network *
[01:44:30] <Poster> you don't have to set a default route to do that, just a route to the business subnet(s)
[01:45:22] <Poster> that may or may not be ok, if it were me I would look at connecting to my home system directly from my work desktop/laptop and not route between the entire business and home system
