[04:40:33] <DiffieHellman> Just dhcpcd is better than NetworkManager if you have wired, but it makes sense if you have Wi-Fi.

[07:21:02] <kayabaNerve> Hello! Quick question. If an application uses a library licensed under MPL 2.0, the application in its entirety is required to make its source code available in some form, correct?
[07:21:55] <kayabaNerve> I honestly have no idea with how the clause in question is written. I'm less interested in full FOSS-ness at this time and just the basic premise of "source available". That said, if the clause does apply to the entire application, it should also be required to be full FOSS.
[07:23:24] <kayabaNerve> Actually, re-reading this, I think I stopped a section short (I read to executable form, not larger work), and that seems to suggest only the library itself has the relevent license requirements...
[07:23:43] <kayabaNerve> Also, sorry if this is the wrong channel. I didn't really know where to go for OSS legal advice and this was my best idea.

[08:01:55] <DiffieHellman> kayabaNerve: This is not the best place for OSS legal advice, but the fsf has written about the requirements of free software licences, and we can link to those.
[08:02:32] <kayabaNerve> Got it, sorry. To be clear, I didn't want actual legal advice versus basic officially non-legal advice commentary on license requirements.
[08:02:41] <kayabaNerve> If the FSF has a write up on the MPL 2, I'd appreciate it.
[08:03:04] <kayabaNerve> corwin: I actually looked for something akin to developers/code before thinking of here.
[08:03:13] <DiffieHellman> Interestingly actually GNU has written about the MPL; https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#MPL-2.0
[08:04:10] <DiffieHellman> Wikipedia about the licence is often good too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License

[08:11:51] <DiffieHellman> kayabaNerve: According to what I know and what I read, the MPL only applies copyleft to whole source files. Just linking code licenced under the MPL to proprietary software doesn't require the release of the proprietary software's source code under the same licence (which is a similar flavour to the LGPL I guess). 
[08:12:05] <kayabaNerve> Yep
[08:12:55] <DiffieHellman> If you go ahead and start writing your proprietary program within the MPL licenced files, then you do need to release such code as the same licence. You also need to release any modifications to the MPL licenced files under the same licence.
[08:13:07] <DiffieHellman> *under the same
[08:16:03] <DiffieHellman> Still, you should just release any nontrivial programs under the GPLv3+ or AGPLv3+ if more suitable.

[14:02:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> Can we make it into a law that FSF will not say shit about hardware
[14:02:24] <Armand> No.
[14:02:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> Why! i am getting sick of FSF hugging endorsing things that doesn't even have ECAD files released under GPLv3 or libre hardware license
[14:03:13] <Armand> Oh well.
[14:03:43] <DiffieHellman> There are libre hardware designs, but there is no such thing as libre hardware unless you make it by hand from the sand.
[14:04:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs i will fork powerpc-notebook into a phone format and have it connected to a 3 kg backpack at this point 
[14:04:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: but that's what i want to do!
[14:04:41] <DiffieHellman> The FSF recommends hardware that doesn't require proprietary drivers or that you load up proprietary firmware. Sure the hardware circuit is proprietary, but that's unavoidable.
[14:04:43] <kompowiec> > unless you make it by hand from the sand
[14:04:44] <kompowiec> sounds more like DIY
[14:04:58] <Armand> "but that's what i want to do!" .... Then.. DO IT.

[14:05:17] <Armand> But, no.
[14:05:27] <Armand> No reason to "stop" doing it.
[14:05:32] <kompowiec> > hardware circuit is proprietary
[14:05:32] <kompowiec> However, it does not bother people in reconstructions on FPGAs, e.g. atari or C64
[14:05:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: I CAN'T BCS NONE WANTS TO GIVE ME THE DAMNED ECAD FILES 
[14:05:43] <Armand> Oh well.

[14:06:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> it matters bcs i don't want to have a POWERPC CPU in a phone connected to a lithium bomb backpack
[14:06:33] <Armand> Then don't.
[14:06:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> i will bcs that's the best option atm
[14:07:05] <Armand> No it's not.
[14:07:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs even though librem and pinephone release the schematics for me to spent 1200 EUR worth of work to convert into the layout i can't legally use those

[14:07:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> YOU ARE LITERALLY ENDORSING THE THING YOU SWORE TO DESTROY!
[14:07:33] <Armand> Then don't
[14:07:46] <Armand> You could.. like.. make your own designs.
[14:08:00] <kompowiec> the only advantage pine/librem it's you can run linux. That's all
[14:08:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: 3400 EUR worth of work
[14:08:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> and then FSF probably shi@@%! on it bcs it's not proprietary 
[14:08:20] <Armand> Also, you *CAN* use whatever these converted layouts are.
[14:08:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> like openmoko 💢
[14:08:28] <Armand> Just don't try selling them.
[14:09:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> if i pay 1200 EUR just to get the thing to make the PCB you bet i am multiplying that by 5 at least

[23:54:01] <SoF> hi! I have a licensing question, I hope that's okay: am I allowed to release a (Rust) library under MIT that contains generated bindings of headers of a C library that is licensed under LGPLv3?
[23:54:12] <SoF> not the .h files themselves, though
[23:58:52] <yrk> SoF: so... release a library that uses some LGPLv3-licensed libraries?
[23:59:18] <SoF> yrk: yes
[23:59:38] <yrk> SoF: sound legit. just abide by the terms of LGPLv3 when doing so.
