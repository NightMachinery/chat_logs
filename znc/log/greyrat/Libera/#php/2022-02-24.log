[01:02:34] <teresko> yeah, got that
[01:03:01] <teresko> it really dependson the DB structure, I think
[01:03:59] <teresko> had anyone actually bothered to implement a closure table tree there, or is it hard-wired for 2-levels of categories
[01:04:12] <teresko> .. I would assume the worst case scenatio anyway
[01:04:22] <Albright> Hard-wired for two levels.
[01:05:09] <teresko> then the big question becomes if whether you even CAN implement it without a major rewrite and re-testing
[01:05:25] <Albright> I am reimplementing it currently.
[01:05:45] <Albright> The client was apprised that this would be a major change.
[01:05:59] <Albright> Still something she wants live by Friday, though.
[01:06:24] <teresko> implementing closure table or will you have next major rewrite when someone decides that it would be nice to have 3 levels of categiries
[01:06:49] <Albright> Would be nice. Doing the minimum possible to get this done before deadline, though. :/
[01:06:57] <teresko> ah

[01:11:39] <Sammitch> I've never implemented it myself, but I _have_ heard the anguished wails of coworkers that did.
[01:14:07] <teresko> I think, instead of doing math on 128bit int, I will just adjust SQL instead
[01:16:35] *** Joins: funhouse (~funhouse@user/funhouse)
[01:17:35] <Sammitch> I am just going on the bedrock assumption that UUIDs are not sortable, so you'd have to construct a surrogate value that you're sorting on and use _that_ as your cursor in a roundabout fashion
[01:18:06] <teresko> nah, that I already got sorted

[01:20:03] <Sammitch> and not a paritcularly relevant one, just when the ID happened to be generated
[01:20:22] <Albright> Then I think you can do something like SELECT fields FROM table WHERE uuid = X UNION (SELECT fields FROM table WHERE uuid < X LIMIT 1) UNION (SELECT … WHERE uuid > X LIMIT 1)
[01:20:56] <teresko> why would I do something that terrible? :D
[01:21:31] <Albright> Because fewer queries is always best, or so I've been told
[01:22:05] <Albright> And axioms like that are always true, no exceptions. ALWAYS
[01:22:53] <teresko> honestly, I am not even sure what that query is suppoed to do?
[01:23:41] <Albright> UNION basically concats the result of one query with another, assuming the fields being selected can match up.
[01:23:45] <teresko> no

[01:32:23] <teresko> ok, so what I originally had was a working solution for pagination, taht uses the classical INT for pagination-without-offset
[01:33:22] <teresko> I already had working next/previous logic, but they template, which was rendering it used -1 and +1 for the doundary elements to generate the URL for the next/previous pages
[01:34:24] <teresko> so my knee-jerk approach was "lets just imcrement UUID" ... which lasted for about 30s when I realized that I will ahve to deal with 128bit integers to do that .. not worth the effort

[01:44:36] <teresko> session are loaded based on SESSID cookie
[01:44:49] <Albright> Yep. PHP is setting and reading cookies behind the scenes.
[01:45:12] <teresko> if you are using sessions, then your application is not stateless
[01:45:48] <teresko> the session is stored (by default) on the server which runs php
[01:46:51] <bewees> In my particular case, is it safe to store the primary key of the username in the cookie and use that to authenticate him like in above paste?
[01:47:04] <bewees> " session is stored (by default) on the server which runs php" ahhh that explains it!
[01:47:31] <Albright> bewees: Yes, that's typically how things are done.
[01:47:43] <teresko> bewees: no, it is NOT safe to store logged in users ID in the cookie
[01:47:55] <teresko> that's a very cute way to get hacked
[01:48:17] <Albright> Oh, yes, I misread it. You can store the ID in $_SESSION but not in a cookie.
[01:48:28] <teresko> ^ that
[01:48:40] <Albright> Users can change the cookie values that a browser sends.
[01:49:02] <Albright> You don't want them to change their ID to an admin user's ID and then be recognized by the site as an admin.
[01:49:52] <Sammitch> cookies are user input, you only send them suggestions of what to send back.
[01:50:17] <teresko> bewees: if you are dealing with a cluster, you can actually make it so taht php store sessions in something like a memcached cluster
[01:51:20] <teresko> but it will make the whole thing a bit slower, since network call is longer that file (cold load) or memory access
[01:51:56] <bewees> Oh you are right, just logged in as another user and it still says id=1 which I misinterpreted as my user ID
[01:52:47] <bewees> So $_SESSION['id'] is as you say stored only in the $_SESSION not in the cookie

[02:00:15] <bewees> Before I knew about serverside session file which are stored on my system in /tmp I thought all session data is stored in the client side cookie. But the id attribute in the cookie is not the same id like $_SESSION['id'], which got me confused initially
[02:01:12] <teresko> btw, there is way to store it in a cookie too =)
[02:01:15] <bewees> and the former (the cookie's id attribute) stays the same (id=1). I used a chrome cookie extension addon to retrieve the cookie
[02:01:17] <teresko> if you really really want to
[02:01:36] <teresko> for example, CakePHP freameworks stores the session in an encrypted cookie
[02:01:57] <teresko> *framework
[02:02:13] <teresko> (which is just one of the reasons why it is a shitty framework)
[02:03:10] <bewees> Is there a reason why they store the session on the client? Does it increase performance on the server?
[02:03:30] <teresko> btw, as a general advice for your code, bewees, put the "level" in your session, so that you do not need to ping the DB every time
[02:03:57] <bewees> Ah, that's a good idea
[02:04:25] <teresko> as for "why store it on a client" - it is one of the solutions for "what to do if you have multiple physical php servers in a cluster"
[02:05:27] <teresko> another thing, you should not make a new PDO object every time you need to make a query
[02:05:35] <nate> So, since someone on the PHP team had the utterly horrible idea to remove the directory support from --with-openssl, has anyone come up with a way to work around it cause I can't seem to find any combination of LD/CFLAG/etc variables that PHP likes which causes it to get finicky at build when multiple OpenSSLs are on
[02:06:00] <teresko> instead make that PDO object once and pass it as a paremeter in a functions that need it, bewees
[02:06:01] <nate> well, other than re-introducing the pathing support into configure myself which would be dreadful lol
[02:09:05] <bewees> teresko, Thanks! I'll change that too. Some .php files have no PDO object, so I will check if the parameter is empty, and only then create a PDO object. Other .php indeed have a PDO obj already
[02:12:34] <teresko> bewees: when you start learing proper object-oriented programming, it will become easier to manage those connections

[03:53:02] <sm> session_destroy eh. This did $_SESSION = array(); session_write_close();. The problem was that it didn't clear the actual session cookie, because it forgot to first set the custom session_name().
[03:54:36] <Albright> Call session_name() first then, I guess. I've never used session_name()
[03:59:46] <sm> yes, and that fixed it. My question was, do I also need to set the same custom session_set_cookie_params() to keep the logout reliable

[12:09:58] <Alexander-47u> can I dom that just using +?
[12:10:10] <Naktibalda> in the same way as 2
[12:10:21] <AllenJB> That or use array_merge()
[12:11:50] *** Quits: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[12:12:36] <Alexander-47u> so $a + $b + $c will suffice right
[12:14:29] <teresko> depends
[12:14:43] <teresko> it will override by key-name
[12:15:21] <Alexander-47u> so $b[1] will overwrite $a[1] even if it is a different value?
[12:15:23] <Naktibalda> it doesn't matter how many arrays you merge, you need to understand the difference between using array_merge and +
[12:16:16] <Naktibalda> both will do the job, but you may get slightly different result, so pick approach that suites you better
[12:16:31] <Alexander-47u> oke I will just try and see
[12:16:54] <Alexander-47u> I just wanted to ask first because I'm editing live production code xD for a small company (my wife's)

[12:19:43] <nate> Curious bug(?), register_shutdown_function() seems like it may cirumvent shutting down sorta?  I have something that does an E_USER_ERROR trigger_error(), which in turn launches the custom shutdown function (clean error response in case of fatals), but PHP throws errors beyond the fatal point as if it continues processing o.O
[12:20:32] <nate> Ah wait not on the latest PHP, lemme update to latest and try again
[12:22:03] <AllenJB> shutdown functions will execute even if there's an error (unless it's something "truly fatal" like memory_limit exceeded or stack exhaustion (too deep recursion))
[12:23:43] <nate> No no I get that, and yeah I intended that.  But what I mean is it throws errors for like undefined vars and stuff /after/ where the E_USER_ERROR trigger_error() is
[12:23:51] <nate> as if it still continued /out/ from the shutdown function
[12:24:15] <nate> even though I even put a die() inside of the shutdown function as well to see if it changed anything
[12:25:55] <AllenJB> Can you reproduce this in an example and show us the code? I highly suspect that that's not what you're actually seeing.

[12:37:24] <Naktibalda> look for set_error_handler
[12:39:00] <AllenJB> Yeah, I think you have a custom error handler with 'return true', which causes the PHP error handler to be bypassed. See https://www.php.net/set_error_handler and https://3v4l.org/mNXIU vs https://3v4l.org/rFVJM

[12:46:06] <nate> Or well wait, should I return an explicit false or?
[12:46:16] <nate> Cause I DO have a custom error handler yes, but it returns nothing (void/null)
[12:46:51] <nate> Which I guess by the "Also note that it is your responsibility to die() if necessary. " comment void/null may be the same as returning true, so I'll have to take that into consideration
[12:46:53] <Naktibalda> examples in manual  call exit()
[12:49:22] <nate> Yep that was it, making sure I exit() with $errno being E_ERROR or E_USER_ERROR did fix it.  Interesting
[12:50:13] <nate> It appears my view of the register shutdown may have been wrong (not that die() was being ignored) in that it's not even being called, E_USER_ERROR does not seem to invoke it curiously
[12:50:58] <Naktibalda> because it was intercepted and didn't reach shutdown point
[12:52:02] <nate> Yeah, strange I swear I remember doing this particular model in the past, but it was ages ago, so the code I sampled it from was a bit... old

[16:26:28] <nate> Didn't something get introduced in PHP7 (or around 7.4) that implemented more efficient ways of checking multiple variables being set/not empty?
[16:26:50] <Naktibalda> null coalesce operator?  $a ?? $b ?? $c
[16:26:52] <nate> like if ('' !== $var1 | $var2 | $var3) ?
[16:27:12] <Naktibalda> isset takes multiple parameters
[16:27:27] <nate> Yeah but isset only checks if they exist/not null, if they're empty it still passes
[16:27:38] <Naktibalda> yes, you could do  $a ?? $b ?? $c ?? null  !== null
[16:27:42] <nate> and empty() doesn't take multiple (which I have no idea why they never made it do so)
[16:27:48] <nate> Ah maybe that's it, let me look at that
[16:27:57] <nate> I mean I'm also trying to check that they're not empty, not just not null
[16:27:57] <Naktibalda> I don't remember anything more efficient for not-empty
[16:28:20] <Naktibalda> using empty() is often considered a bad practice
[16:28:27] <nate> Maybe it was an RFC that never passed, swear I rember some sort of weird '' !== $var1 | $var2 | $var3 shorthand thing
[16:34:38] <__adrian> nate: no shorthand for empty(), no.
[16:35:30] <nate> darn, ah well, I mean not hard to make a generic wrapper function to do it I guess lol
