[08:21:58] <A-KO> damn my FSA fund folks really do not like coughing up money lol
[08:22:05] <Work-BWMerlin> Well xe0n, I have a new printer which needs to be install and I am trying to run up a new printer server to move from uniflow to papercut (and domain migration with server consolidation) so I will be able to test with this printer
[08:22:44] <A-KO> they denied my reimbursement at first--even though all the information was there in what they asked. And then I had to call. Spoke to someone, she added her notes saying "no the info is there. You're just blind." They finally reimburse me half of it, without reimbursing me from my 2020 FSA.
[08:22:48] <Work-BWMerlin> Test with new printer, if works great if not make it work.  Install papercut, bring office printers into papercut, once working bring large printers into it
[08:23:00] <A-KO> There's a grace period for using your 2020 FSA through 12/31/2021 due to covid.
[08:23:08] <A-KO> So you damn right I'm going to cash that thing out and use it for this
[08:23:16] <A-KO> so I resubmitted another expense *again* from the 2020 FSA
[08:23:24] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: so you're going to spend $1000 in man-hours trying to get them to cover what they already said they would, eh?
[08:23:24] <A-KO> and I'm sure I'll have to call *again* when they deny it
[08:23:26] <Work-BWMerlin> FSA?
[08:23:36] <A-KO> JollyRgrs: lol basically
[08:23:58] <A-KO> They just really don't like to cough up FSA funds
[08:24:10] <A-KO> because you forfeit your FSA. So I'm sure they're absolutely not fucking happy about the 2020 extension
[08:24:11] <A-KO> tough cookies
[08:24:37] <A-KO> I'm burning basically my entire remaining 2020 FSA on the surgery lol.
[08:24:53] <A-KO> I've still got another few visits to cover out of the remaining 2021 FSA but I expect to basically blow through my FSA
[08:24:55] <catbeard> Work-BWMerlin: flexible spending account
[08:25:09] <A-KO> I'll have to out of pocket the rest of my expenses towards the end of the year

[08:26:01] <Work-BWMerlin> You are spending work money on surgery?  I think I am miss understanding something
[08:26:17] <A-KO> I'm on a PPO. They just won't let me use an HSA because I'm not on what's considered a "High Deductible Health Plan"
[08:26:21] <A-KO> so I have to use an FSA
[08:26:45] <catbeard> A-KO: family plan?
[08:26:45] <Work-BWMerlin> None of that means anything to me
[08:26:48] <catbeard> or just you
[08:26:59] <catbeard> Work-BWMerlin: US healthcare bullshit
[08:27:41] <Work-BWMerlin> Oh sorry, I understand socialist hell free health care
[08:27:48] <catbeard> it depends whether you get health insurance knowing you're going to be going to the hospital a lot or not at all
[08:28:06] <catbeard> same with other services, dental, vision, e.g.
[08:28:34] <catbeard> then every year on open enrollment you can change up your plan

[08:36:58] <A-KO> with covid, however, they made a law that says that everyone's 2020 FSAs can be used for 2021 expenses. At first, it was only on expenses until July 31st or something like that. But at some point that got extended until the end of the year.

[09:49:47] <catbeard> oh.. weird
[09:49:49] <Hunterkll> but I noticed it when I RDP'd to it, then went and checked physically

[10:03:04] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:03:13] <Hunterkll> lol DDR 
[10:03:21] <Hunterkll> Voodoo cards wouldn't have been in DDR capable systems
[10:03:24] <Hunterkll> DDR was P4 era
[10:03:38] <catbeard> actually it may have been Diamond
[10:03:43] <Hunterkll> Voodoo was basically dead by then - nVidia's TNT2 chipset nuked 'em 
[10:03:50] <Hunterkll> then got eaten up
[10:04:23] <Hunterkll> 3dfx got bought by nVidia in the late 90s/early 2000s 
[10:04:41] <catbeard> this was circa 1995-1997 so ya
[10:05:00] <catbeard> somewhere around there
[10:05:18] <Hunterkll> DDR2 first was made in 2001 i think
[10:05:32] <catbeard> yeah so wasn't ddr2 then

[10:12:59] <Hunterkll> catbeard: i have tubes of AMD SRAM DIP chips, TTL logic chips, all sorts of different ICs, etc
[10:13:04] <Hunterkll> now they just make... CPUs and GPUs and that's it
[10:13:07] <catbeard> did AMD rely on a hack like intel to get their speed (speculative execution)
[10:13:07] <Hunterkll> and don't even fab themselves
[10:13:24] <Hunterkll> catbeard: almost all modern CPUs have/use spec-ex/OOO
[10:13:37] <Disconsented> Which ones done?
[10:13:40] <Disconsented> RISCV I guess ..?
[10:13:46] <Disconsented> Maybe?
[10:13:53] <Hunterkll> catbeard: that's why spectre/meltdown hit in varying degrees everything from IBM z/Architecture CPUs, POWER CPUs, ARM, x86 of both major vendors, etc 
[10:14:02] <catbeard> right though i mean Intel squeezed the hell out of that and backpedaled when someone dropped L1TF
[10:14:08] <Hunterkll> not really
[10:14:15] <Hunterkll> they just fixed that in silicon and moved on 
[10:14:21] <Hunterkll> still using the same techniques
[10:14:23] <Hunterkll> both vendors are
[10:15:15] <Hunterkll> spectre basically hit every modern CPU regardless of architecture because of spec-ex
[10:15:16] <catbeard> heard it's something like 19B to fab the prototype and fractions of a penny to make more from the prototype template
[10:15:52] <Hunterkll> does depend on complexity, but it was like just $1mil to do the first bitcoin mining ASICs 
[10:16:10] <catbeard> ya like you'd need a fab facility, clean room
[10:16:29] <Hunterkll> yea not necessarily that high of a cost once you've got design banged out 
[10:18:01] <catbeard> so do you think they just make hella billions of copies and sell until they run out, or queue up massive orders for resellers and just make to order to keep costs down
[10:18:24] <Hunterkll> both, depending
[10:19:06] <catbeard> depending on like market sway, expected sales, competitor release timelines, vendor/reseller exclusivity
[10:19:08] <catbeard> ?
[10:19:11] <Hunterkll> yea
[10:19:17] <Hunterkll> catbeard: for example, Itanium CPU production ended in January 2020, but intel shipped the last batch on July 29, 2021 
[10:19:33] <Hunterkll> obviously, they overproduce a little bit - you know, warranty exchanges and the li ke
[10:19:43] <Hunterkll> my i9-7980xe is actually a warranty exchange CPU direct from intel

[10:30:56] <Hunterkll> when you pair it with software/firmware that does tiering 
[10:31:01] <Hunterkll> based on frequency of access

[11:12:12] <Hunterkll> not even
[11:12:16] <Hunterkll> cortana *is* windows search now

[11:13:09] <Activ8> good I hate cortana
[11:13:19] <Activ8> hey cortana strip tease for me
[11:13:20] <Hunterkll> Activ8: because windows search/cortana were merged
[11:13:26] <Activ8> yeh 
[11:13:32] <Hunterkll> so you still have cortana running it's just only providing the windows search functionality 
[11:13:51] <Hunterkll> there's still store bits etc in ltsc 
[11:13:56] <Hunterkll> to provide necessary functions 
[11:13:57] <Activ8> yeh
[11:14:13] <Activ8> well she better not talk in LTSC
[11:14:16] <Hunterkll> thinking it's "debloated" is hilarious to me

[11:17:19] <Hunterkll> 11's been a decent step up

[11:17:25] <Activ8> only my laptop
[11:17:30] <Hunterkll> ah yea, that's a thing
[11:17:39] <Activ8> well officially it wonâ€™t support it
[11:17:46] <Hunterkll> my CPU snuck into the supported list since it's skylake-x / refresh 
[11:17:59] <Hunterkll> so guaranteed working MBEC, etc
[11:18:10] <Activ8> Im saving up now for a new build
[11:18:12] <Hunterkll> and i've had a hardware TPM 2.0 module since i built the system in 2017 
[11:18:31] <Activ8> i would only need board,cpu and memory
[11:18:40] <Activ8> i wouldnâ€™t be upgrading gpu
[11:18:49] <Activ8> and power supply should be alright
[11:18:59] <Hunterkll> i really need to replace my PSU
[11:19:13] <Activ8> i have TPM 2.0 but cpu will never be on the supported list

[11:20:05] <Hunterkll> wouldn't break anything, but 
[11:20:17] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Because it's a potential security risk
[11:20:28] <Hunterkll> well
[11:20:28] <Activ8> oh then donâ€™t enable security risks
[11:20:31] <Hunterkll> basically 
[11:20:34] <Activ8> lol
[11:20:37] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> But I dunno if it's seen as normal and ok and I dunno if I could just turn it back off after to mitigate risk
[11:20:54] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Well enabling rdp and ssh at all on a pc is a security risk haha
[11:20:56] <Hunterkll> you want constrained delegation aka"only this system can use credential to access X system via Y protocol/method"
[11:21:07] <Activ8> its how you manage it colour
[11:21:09] <Hunterkll> credssp just says "hey, you have valid credentials and privs, come on in!"
[11:21:11] <Activ8> just document it 
[11:21:13] <Hunterkll> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/credential-security-support-provider

[11:21:35] <Activ8> Right I best log into my voip phone, I start at 9 until 2 again

[11:21:38] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:21:50] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Jump box?
[11:21:58] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> How does that solve it
[11:21:59] <Hunterkll> yea RDP to a box that has direct access
[11:22:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:22:04] <Activ8> is the 2nd hop causing real world problems here
[11:22:38] <Hunterkll> but the tl;dr is that 
[11:22:49] <Hunterkll> credssp doesn't do constrained delegation
[11:22:53] <Hunterkll> that's the only real factor
[11:23:01] <Hunterkll> it still uses kerberos if possible (then falls back to ntlm)
[11:23:07] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> So if you wanted to access a network share within a powershell remote session how would you do it?
[11:23:07] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Credssp is the way Microsoft seems to tell me but they note the security risk issue
[11:23:19] <Hunterkll> right
[11:23:27] <Hunterkll> the security risk issue is that it passes the cred without any restrictions 
[11:23:45] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> So I dunno how I feel about it l
[11:23:47] <Hunterkll> so say you have X system that should only manage Hyper-V, you set up constrained delegation 
[11:23:53] <Hunterkll> and it can ONLY manage hyper-v 
[11:24:09] <Hunterkll> credssp, if it's an admin on the remote box, it can do anything, not just hyper-v things
[11:24:31] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Well say I want to run a script on every system that copies files to or from a network share what do

[11:56:15] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I assume you at least have a house.
[11:56:23] <Hunterkll> nope
[11:56:29] <Hunterkll> housing savage has not yet been cleared
[11:56:55] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I second that the game is good, but if you're easily distracted by side quests and too many things to do, it's a "bad" game
[11:57:03] <Hunterkll> ehhhh
[11:57:16] <Hunterkll> i find the most common co mplaint now is that it forces you to play storyline 
[11:57:19] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> On the other hand, there's tons of content and things to do
[11:57:19] <Hunterkll> instead of letting you do that
[11:57:21] <Hunterkll> LOL
[11:57:30] <Hunterkll> yea i'm a blackjack dealer at many places......
[11:57:42] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> nice
[11:57:54] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> Yeah, the MSQ was a slog, but if you like cutscenes in your games and enjoy that part of FF
[11:57:58] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> then you'll love it
[11:58:03] <Hunterkll> well
[11:58:09] <Hunterkll> you can skip all the cutscenes if you really want to
[11:58:15] <Hunterkll> except for two runs
[11:58:33] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I still have to finish some of the ShB post-MSQ stuff, hit 80 about a week and a half ago
[11:59:01] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> prae and castrum, I do those for rewards while I'm in work meetings
[11:59:14] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I can just go brain idle and pick up a bunch of experience
[11:59:19] <Hunterkll> jesus
[11:59:26] <Hunterkll> yea lol
[11:59:32] <Hunterkll> MSQ is to level the ones i'm working on just for glams 
[11:59:40] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:59:46] <Hunterkll> i cook something, then queue MSQ
[12:00:01] <Hunterkll> is lunch break + half a level easy (at least 60+ )

[12:00:48] <Hunterkll> took ROG from 6 to 22 yesterday
[12:01:55] <Hunterkll> kinda glad they're nixing belts 
[12:04:56] <Hunterkll> @Haise sent you a code, it's good for 120 days, after 30 days of subscription we get our first rewardrs 
[12:05:17] <Hunterkll> https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/
[12:05:20] <Hunterkll> Details here

[12:06:33] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Still at school
[12:06:48] <DrZak> is this looking like a kndergarten game too?
[12:06:50] <Hunterkll> Haha, and I do recommend that you buy the game outright instead of the free to play stuff 
[12:06:52] <DrZak> like world of warcraft?
[12:07:03] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I will get sub
[12:07:04] <Hunterkll> if you don't you have a 300k gil cap, can't trade, etc  
[12:07:06] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Through Steam
[12:07:09] <Hunterkll> oh
[12:07:12] <Hunterkll> don't do it through steam
[12:07:16] <Hunterkll> i made that mistake 5 years ago
[12:07:16] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Oh ?
[12:07:27] <Hunterkll> yea..... you have to do EVERYTHING via steam after that
[12:07:38] <Hunterkll> so like, when an expac was on sale 50% off at one site
[12:07:40] <Hunterkll> i bought a key
[12:07:45] <Hunterkll> couldn't redeem it since i had a steam account
[12:07:58] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Okay so Steam is no go
[12:08:00] <Hunterkll> so i'm stuck paying full price forever for base expansions 
[12:08:00] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Got it
[12:08:23] <Hunterkll> now upgrades (digital collectors, etc) can be done via mog station no issue
[12:08:41] <Hunterkll> but subscription payment, base game, expansions, etc all have to be done via steam
[12:08:45] <Hunterkll> something to do with the billing system
[12:09:09] <Hunterkll> DrZak: it's like WoW but doesn't suck
[12:09:35] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I stopped playing WoW 2-3 years ago lol

[12:09:47] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> this is my character
[12:10:02] <Hunterkll> not bad
[12:10:15] <Hunterkll> @Shocklance leveling your crafters is stupid easy tho, should finish that - could probably 80 them all in a week 
[12:10:32] <Hunterkll> Crystarium turn-ins & levequests 
[12:10:37] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I just got them to 70 earlier in the week
[12:10:57] <Hunterkll> ah i've got fully pentamelded asthete gear and shit on mine now
[12:10:57] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> and my gatherers to 80 as well, just gotta plan it out and have the gil to do it
[12:10:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:11:16] <Hunterkll> @Shocklance https://ffxiv-beta.lokyst.net/index.html#/solver
[12:11:19] <Hunterkll> it doesn't have the new items
[12:11:25] <Hunterkll> but it'll spit out macros for all turn in/levequest items
[12:11:28] <Hunterkll> to maximize HQ chances
[12:11:44] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> that's...
[12:11:46] <Hunterkll> sadly hasn't been updated in 2 years but oh well 
[12:11:51] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> Wow. Alright.
[12:11:54] <Hunterkll> still has everything you need to fast-80 everything
[12:12:13] <Hunterkll> been thinking about forking it to add shit like exarchic gear and aesthete gear 
[12:12:29] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I also have teamcraft installed and built a few macros for diadem turn-ins from 60-70
[12:12:31] <Hunterkll> it doesn't even have chili crab lol 
[12:12:42] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> which was a lot of press button, wait
[12:12:54] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Do you guys have any starting tips ?
[12:12:56] <Hunterkll> yea lol, well, i used this to 80 everything with leves and cryst turnins
[12:13:02] <Hunterkll> @Haise follow the main story 
[12:13:05] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I need to get a set of level 70 crafting gear probably today
[12:13:06] <Hunterkll> just do that
[12:13:14] <Hunterkll> don't be like a dude who fucking leveled to 40 before doing main story 
[12:13:19] <Hunterkll> and is wondering why he isnt leveling faster
[12:13:19] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:13:27] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> okay, I will follow main story
[12:13:34] <Hunterkll> the game literally guides you that way 
[12:13:42] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> Starting tips: follow the MSQ, play a tank or healer if you're interested, you'll get better queue times that way
[12:13:42] <Hunterkll> so idk how he fucked up so hard
[12:13:44] <Hunterkll> it was hilarious
[12:13:46] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Also, should I wait for that new expansion or get current one ?
[12:14:03] <Hunterkll> start now - it'll put you in a better position for expac 
[12:14:09] <Hunterkll> it's not a rat race though 
[12:14:18] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> if you start and play on the Aether datacenter (which I don't think people can start new characters on, so I guess this is moot)
[12:14:27] <Hunterkll> Come to primal 
[12:14:29] <Hunterkll> Aether sucks
[12:14:41] <Hunterkll> Famfrit is where all the good whore houses are 
[12:14:42] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> *shrug* it's got nice pings for me
[12:14:42] <Hunterkll> er i mean
[12:14:46] <Hunterkll> gameplay
[12:14:57] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> whore houses :D
[12:15:00] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Best houses
[12:15:03] <Hunterkll> "user created content"
[12:15:15] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Not surprised LOL
[12:15:22] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> crystal has neither of those. Primal is probably the best one if you don't care about ping/latency to the DC
[12:15:33] <Hunterkll> Aether, if you're into that kinda RP stuff, is too rigid 
[12:15:41] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> but if you're in australia or some shit you might want to reconsider
[12:15:42] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I mean how bad can ping be from European fiber
[12:15:55] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I think that's US East, so not bad
[12:16:10] <Hunterkll> there's two european datacenters
[12:16:13] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Oh if its US East I am not that concerned
[12:16:20] <Hunterkll> but Primal is US east and great 
[12:16:23] * teh_f4ll3n_ is sitting in a hotel room in Russia. "Working" remotely
[12:16:45] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n_: ohhh where at?
[12:16:51] <Hunterkll> I miss moscow.....
[12:16:57] <teh_f4ll3n_> the old capital
[12:17:03] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Sankt Peterburg ?
[12:17:25] <Hunterkll> @Haise if you join up on Primal then I can help you with shit i suppose
[12:17:27] <Hunterkll> if i'm not busy
[12:17:30] <Hunterkll> and not gambling
[12:17:35] <Hunterkll> :P
[12:17:52] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I will work through story mostly solo and ask for help if needed :P
[12:18:03] <Hunterkll> Well, let's say this
[12:18:06] <Hunterkll> 1-50 is a slog sometimes
[12:18:10] <Hunterkll> they've made it better
[12:18:20] <Hunterkll> but at lvl 50 you have like 60+ quests to do before lvl 51 quests
[12:18:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:18:36] <Hunterkll> but the game does dump you into a so-called 'novice network' to ask for help as well
[12:18:38] <teh_f4ll3n_> @Haise, yup
[12:18:48] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> novice network can be good on some servers
[12:18:53] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> it's awful on some
[12:19:02] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> oh
[12:19:09] <Hunterkll> @Shocklance look at the requirements to fucking become a battle mentor 
[12:19:10] <Hunterkll> jesus christ
[12:19:22] <Hunterkll> clear LITERALLY FUCKING EVERYTHING
[12:19:38] <Hunterkll> and yes, that includes e12s 
[12:20:04] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Now more of a technical question, would it be horrible to run Win 11 on i5 6600k and i7 7700hq lol
[12:20:14] <Hunterkll> second one no 
[12:20:17] <Hunterkll> first one potentially
[12:20:32] <Hunterkll> depends on how they enforce the HVCI/etc functions that are supposed to be mandatory
[12:20:39] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> this may not mean anything now, but I recommend setting your aetheryte favorites to mor dhona and western thanalan
[12:20:42] <Hunterkll> on the 6 series, you're looking at a 15-30% CPU performance loss 
[12:20:55] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> because the MSQ likes to send you back there heh
[12:20:57] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Okay so stay with Win 10 on that one ?
[12:20:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:21:01] <Hunterkll> yea
[12:21:06] <Hunterkll> you have till 2025 
[12:21:23] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Yeah it will be like that most likely
[12:21:28] <Hunterkll> but the 7 series i'd bang it up to dev channel now
[12:21:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:21:44] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Laptop has good CPU and shitty GPU and main PC has shitty CPU but good GPU
[12:21:58] <Hunterkll> well, define shitty
[12:22:03] <Hunterkll> intel integrated is good en ough for this game
[12:22:23] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> I'm keeping Win 10 on my Ryzen 5 1600 / RX 5500 XT
[12:22:27] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I play some AAA games like RE8 that would stomp GTX 1050 on my laptop
[12:22:38] <Hunterkll> GTX 1050 is MORE than enough for this game
[12:22:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:22:48] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> Yeah, FFXIV has to run on consolese
[12:23:01] <Hunterkll> @Shocklance to be fair, t hose consoles are PS4 
[12:23:02] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> so it's not too graphically intense
[12:23:06] <Hunterkll> which isn't exactly bad 
[12:23:18] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> unless you do hunt trains and have 100 people beating on an S-Rank
[12:23:23] <Hunterkll> i'm sad they haven't done any upgrades to FFXI's rendering engine  
[12:23:28] <teh_f4ll3n_> ooooh... FFXIV talk
[12:23:36] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> and then that gets a bit much sparkly-wise
[12:23:43] <Hunterkll> FFXI was constrained forever by running on PS2 and XBOX 360 
[12:23:45] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> and then you die to the mudman for the 2nd time that day
[12:23:45] <teh_f4ll3n_> haven't fired that puppy up since I finished ARR
[12:23:50] <Hunterkll> when they finally dropped those platforms it was too late....
[12:24:02] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n_: oh boy you've got a lot of catching up to do

[12:44:09] <Hunterkll> all he does is go play gold saucer minigames

[12:47:30] <sd> 13<Sâ€‹hocklance> ascension is my favorite mode as typically no NPC's have a full theme deck

[12:49:34] <Hunterkll> the game is storyline focused and storyline content
[12:49:39] <Hunterkll> howevere, the side stuff is so expansive

[20:47:18] <PublicWiFi> @oâ€‹nenerdyguy tbh im kind of the opposite, ill push back against cloud hosted stuff until there's a good reason. on-prem exchange is an exception
[20:47:23] <PublicWiFi> cause FUCK on-prem email lol
[20:47:33] <DrZak> well, hopefully they will stick it into the next version of 'server manager'
[20:47:38] <Hunterkll> on-prem email makes sense in a lot of cases, but only if you know how to do it 
[20:47:42] <PublicWiFi> ^
[20:47:46] <Hunterkll> DrZak: standalone app is the solution 
[20:47:49] <Hunterkll> that's coming
[20:47:52] <PublicWiFi> for small businesses it tends to be better to use hosted email
[20:47:56] <DrZak> its kinda ridiculous to keep an entire exchange server and a license for thousand E just to do few eidts
[20:47:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> Hunterkll and honestly most businesses don't know how to doi t

[20:48:29] <DrZak> only for exchange '16
[20:48:33] <Hunterkll> sure
[20:48:36] <Hunterkll> and that's all you need

[20:49:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:49:49] <DrZak> tbh. it doesnt really matter for companies
[20:49:52] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: still cheaper iirc, but 
[20:49:57] <PublicWiFi> thats dumb
[20:50:01] <DrZak> infact i would imagine it will be easier to stomach for them
[20:50:03] <PublicWiFi> and it foreshadows the MS future
[20:50:10] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: basically they're only doing exchange on-prem anymore for companies like mine
[20:50:11] <DrZak> coz monthly number is smaller then one perpetual big numbers
[20:50:21] <DrZak> and cheaper is always better
[20:50:52] <DrZak> if you are a waste of human skin CEO/CIO and can show savings for the 4 years you are staying in the office and stealing oxygen

[23:48:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> Mr Owl. yeah that is a challenge - If you have AAD P1 or AAD P2 you can exempt it from the policy

[23:48:46] <CptLuxx> just enable security defaults in o365
[23:48:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> HurdyGurdy - MS recomends disabling legacy protocols anyway, NEW tenants that use security defaults have them off by default, AND starting in october at some point they will begin turning it off for tenants that still have them on
[23:48:49] <CptLuxx> bam no basic auth
[23:49:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> CptLuxx my problem with that is no emergency access account

[23:49:28] <sd> 03<Mâ€‹r. Owl> My experience with copiers thoroughly convinced me they are highly insecure, because they donâ€™t implement auto updates, no on-prem IT is going to do firmware updates for security patching of printers, and itâ€™s of course a networked device
