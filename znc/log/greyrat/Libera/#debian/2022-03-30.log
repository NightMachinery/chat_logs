[07:28:43] <greycat> or else kill all your personal bashes with -9 which will prevent it from cleaning up (which includes writing the history file)

I found out that in Debian syslogd runs as root and in Ubuntu it runs as syslog user. This seems to be causing some problems with at least one package which is imported from Debian.

[14:49:49] <yurtesen> If you need details, the launchpad bug id is #1964881 but to summarize the log file catalina.out is written as syslog user in Ubuntu as syslog is not able to create it as tomcat user. Logrotated rotates this log as tomcat user and tomcat user does not have write access to file owned by syslog user.
[14:49:51] *** Joins: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador)
[14:50:22] <Khepra> yurtesen: so the problem is in ubuntu? also are you sure about that syslog user? doesn't sound... plausible.   iirc  root:adm was ownership of /var/log/ files on ubuntu last time I checked
[14:51:27] <Khepra> anyway, this sounds squarely like an #ubuntu issue :)

[14:58:48] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[14:58:58] <yurtesen> Khepra: you are right it is an Ubuntu mess basically. /var/log in 22.04 is owned by root:syslog but actually syslog group does not have write access there. If you check tomcat9 changelog, you can see that in version 9.0.36-1 is an entry saying "* Grant write access on /var/log/tomcat9 to the adm group (LP: #1861881)" at https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/t/tomcat9/tomcat
[14:58:58] <yurtesen> 9_9.0.58-1_changelog
[14:59:57] <yurtesen> So, even though this is a Ubuntu mess, somehow there is a fix (if you can call it that) tricked down into the Debian package.
[15:00:09] <yurtesen> s/tricked/trickled/
[15:00:12] <Khepra> yurtesen: that doesn't sound right; that would imply the rsyslog is completely broken out of the box. but uh... this is very offtopic here :)
[15:01:35] <Khepra> yurtesen: on debian, /var/log files and dirs are typically  root:adm owned, and rsyslog runs as root (naturally, it has to). now it's possible that individual packages write into /var/log/ directly, like nginx does, but for those there has to be a root process that opens the FDs and hands them over to unpriv worker process to write into

[15:01:53] <password> \o
[15:02:03] <Khepra> you cannot avoid root if you want ownership control; unless you somehow pre-create the files with tmpfiles  or logrotate hooks but that's just giant mess in the making.

[18:11:56] <aog> gnome or xfce?
[18:12:06] <waylore> xfce
[18:12:13] <waylore> because it's much lighter
[18:12:24] <waylore> i am using 400mb right now
[18:12:27] <Khepra> lighter also means "less functions"
[18:12:27] <aog> oki doki
[18:12:37] <waylore> gnome uses like 1 gb
[18:12:42] <Khepra> depends on which apps you run
[18:12:46] <waylore> the difference is huge
[18:12:51] <Khepra> I can get you openbox to consume over 9000 MB
[18:12:51] <waylore> i am talking about the enviroment
[18:12:59] <waylore> without any apss open
[18:13:08] <aog> 120% heavier
[18:13:11] <waylore> it depends on your hardware really
[18:13:18] <waylore> if you have 8gb and you like gnome
[18:13:19] <waylore> go with it
[18:13:27] <waylore> if you have 4gb like me gnome is not an option
[18:13:29] <aog> I have 16GB ram
[18:13:39] <waylore> then go with whatever you like imho :p
[18:13:44] <waylore> i still like xfce more
[18:13:52] <aog> i don't know, never used any
[18:13:55] <aog> guess I'll try both
[18:14:01] <aog> start w/ xfce
[18:14:09] <waylore> well if you like desktop icons and basic functionality without frustration
[18:14:12] <waylore> go with xfce
[18:14:18] <tradar> try also LXDE
[18:14:23] <waylore> if you enjoy fighting your DE go with gnome
[18:14:30] <Khepra> according to this (and some others I've seen), gnome and xfce use approx the same out of the box. https://www.reddit.com/r/xfce/comments/kb0d87/i_compared_the_ram_use_of_15_desktop_environments/
[18:14:40] <waylore> i just tested it today...

[19:51:00] <jelly> !epoch
[19:51:00] <dpkg> [epoch] a fixed point in a chronology or the start of an era.  For example, y2k was a 2 digit year epoch.  In Unix, epoch often refers to the time from which seconds are counted; epoch was is Jan 1 1970 and we will run out of 32 bit numbers for this on Jan 18 2038 (by which time we will have hopefully all migrated to 64-bit architectures).  An epoch can also be used to help manage version numbering in Debian; ask me about <version epoch>.
[19:51:08] <jelly> !version epoch
[19:51:08] <dpkg> The version number of a package has a prepended number called the "epoch".  It is only added when the system for upstream version numbers changes.  Example: in sarge, X was version 6.8 but in etch it was 1.1 (xfree86->xorg).  But 1 < 6, so we add an epoch "2:" to signify that everything with 2: is newer (if there is no : the epoch is assumed to be "0").  See section 5.6.12 of <policy> or ask me about <compare versions> <debian revision>.
[19:51:27] <jelly> the latter.
[19:51:41] <somiaj> EugenMayer: compare the version you want 5:20.10.4~3-0~debian-buster with the version you pinned 20.10.4~*, notice the 5: missing at the front.

On Debian, I get "command not found" but if I do it with sudo, I get the results. Does blkid not need root in ubuntu? Is there a way to get more information, that yes the command is there, but you need to be root to use it?
[21:23:29] <karlpinc> !path
[21:23:29] <dpkg> PATH is the environment variable that tells the OS where to look for programs.  It is defined in /etc/profile or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile (for sh-like shells) or ~/.login for csh-like shells.  http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_07_02.html
[21:23:36] <karlpinc> semitones: see above
[21:24:02] <semitones> I see it, but I do not understand. Is blkid in the root path, but not the user path?

[21:27:34] <karlpinc> (I seem to get this for every package I've asked judd about lately.)
[21:29:33] <semitones> So in debian, vs ubuntu, if I get "command not found" it might just mean I need to use sudo, but it might also mean that I need to install that command. Is that just how it is typically? You don't know which it is until you investigate?

[21:31:22] <dpkg> Some binaries, particularly system utilities are installed to /sbin or /usr/sbin rather than /bin or /usr/bin. The former directories are not in a standard user's PATH. Try calling them directly, e.g. /sbin/ifconfig, or running them as root. See also <buster su>.
[21:32:21] <karlpinc> semitones: But if an ordinary user runs a command in sbin, often they won't have the permissions needed to get the expected output.

[22:32:37] <xx> Khepra: I've had others confirm that it works on their end, but they don't run debian.
[22:32:52] <xx> so I wonder what packages I need to backport or install to make it work in debian
[22:33:29] <xx> Heston: most emojis work üêà
[22:36:20] <Heston> try fonts-noto-color-emoji
[22:36:56] <xx> no official backports, sucks
[22:37:41] <xx> but yeah that'll be the one
[22:38:00] <Khepra> I can see that one yeah, nice in technicolor.

[22:48:09] <xx> if that were the right way to do it, then debian might as well just update the package in -stable

[23:14:05] <cosimone> hello, i noticed something weird and i don't know if this is a problem with the distributino or not: to isolate it down to the narrowest scope, it seems like notification-daemon and notification-daemon:i386 conflict (the latter is needed for some software only present on i386, such as pcsx2).  why is it so?  even though i doubt removing notification-daemon (as it would normally do) would cause any practical problem, is there a way to
[23:14:05] <cosimone> avoid this conflict?

[23:50:17] <somiaj> cosimone: in general binaries are not multiarch and unlike libs cannot have both the amd64 and i386 version installed side by side.

[23:54:56] <somiaj> cosimone: looking at the source for notification-daemon it isn't configured to be multiarch, so that is why there is a conflict. In general expected binaries to behave this way, it is only libs (and not development headers) that are setup to be installed side by side.

[23:55:51] <somiaj> Though, why would the arch of notification daemon matter, couldn't a i386 software talk to the amd64 daemon through the same protocol?
