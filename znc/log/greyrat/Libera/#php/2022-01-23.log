[07:40:40] <__adrian> what?
[07:41:15] <chazy> i have a backed enum and i want to get the value of an instance by specifying a number that matches the cases' order
[07:42:01] <chazy> the number is an auto-increment field, so i just need to subtract 1
[07:42:49] *** Joins: Colt (~Colt@user/colt)
[07:43:32] <Blondie101010> what are you doing?  are you matching enum in your code to something in SQL?
[07:43:45] <chazy> yes
[07:45:03] <__adrian> why would you not use the value in the first place? i don't believe anything guarantees the order of cases in an enum. the fact that the array has keys doesn't mean those keys mean anything to the enum.
[07:45:34] <__adrian> *cases() array
[07:45:38] <__adrian> it's just a list
[07:45:43] <chazy> maybe i don't need an enum...
[07:46:08] <Blondie101010> using the value itself makes this much more maintainable
[07:46:12] <__adrian> what's your use case?
[07:46:38] <__adrian> it is "value must be one of ..." ?
[07:46:38] <chazy> what if i create a method that maps this number to a case?
[07:46:55] <__adrian> i still don't know why on earth you'd want to
[07:47:07] <__adrian> forget about the solution for a moment and tell us what the problem is
[07:47:15] <__adrian> what's your use case?
[07:48:02] <chazy> i have data for 3 different cases, i need to store this data somehow and map it to a sql column
[07:49:03] <__adrian> so you have cases x,y,z and each maps to {some information}. you want to store "one of x|y|z" yes?
[07:50:00] <chazy> no, i want to access one of x,y,z
[07:50:14] <Blondie101010> way too unclear
[07:50:21] <chazy> i have this column which can be one of the three
[07:50:44] <Blondie101010> what is "column"?  an output element or a DB field?
[07:50:53] <chazy> a db field
[07:51:02] <Blondie101010> so it's an enum in the DB
[07:51:11] <Blondie101010> or similar
[07:51:20] <__adrian> class Info { public function get(Xyz $case) { ... } }  enum Xyz { case X; case Y; case Z; }
[07:51:36] <__adrian> ^ is what i'm hearing
[07:52:19] <chazy> the $case is what i don't have
[07:54:35] <__adrian> well, i'm still unclear. but the rule of thumb would be to use the enum to look up the data (i.e., use it as a key).
[07:54:40] <__adrian> maybe needs more explanatio
[07:54:41] <__adrian> n
[07:56:32] <chazy> https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/41ffbefcc82bcd2a0369a59d5c2c7f26
[07:58:09] <chazy> i was thinking of doing `MaxPercentage::cases()[$character->division]->value;` but since you said the cases order is not guaranteed...
[07:58:12] <__adrian> aside:  find(1)  is the wrong code ;)
[07:58:20] <__adrian> find(FIRST_DIVISION)
[07:58:39] <__adrian> you define constants _specifically_ to avoid using the values in your code.
[07:58:40] <chazy> no, find(1) is a character id
[07:58:59] <__adrian> then... not sure it's relevant to the example?
[07:59:43] <chazy> yeah well i was trying to illustrate the object creation but nvm
[08:00:06] <Blondie101010> you seem to be trying to patch a constant solution with an enum
[08:00:21] <__adrian> so it's like i showed above: you want to map the division number to its minimum percentile
[08:00:21] <Blondie101010> is this app already live?
[08:00:42] <chazy> not yet
[08:00:50] <__adrian> [Division::FIRST_DIVISION => MaxPercentage::FIRST_DIVISION, ...]
[08:00:58] <Blondie101010> then use the value
[08:01:00] <__adrian> or similar
[08:01:08] <__adrian> for the enum, yes, use the value
[08:02:20] <chazy> so i replace the enums with classes, and create the Division class, these classes only have constants
[08:02:34] <chazy> now, where do i put the array? i mean do i repeat it everywhere?
[08:03:02] <__adrian> probably behind a method in the Divisions class
[08:03:08] <__adrian> (or interface)
[08:03:19] <Blondie101010> your code is really hard to relate to...  all names seem misleading to me
[08:03:32] <__adrian> yeah, still not clear, unfortunately.
[08:04:01] <__adrian> which is it you need to store? i would imagine the division
[08:04:29] <__adrian> and i'm completely lost on "store this data somehow and map it to a sql column"
[08:04:52] <chazy> the division is already in the database, i need to put the percentages somewhere in php
[08:05:39] <Blondie101010> what is in the DB specifically, and what do you want to see in PHP?
[08:05:57] <Blondie101010> please give at least one example
[08:06:28] <__adrian> $division = new Division($somethingFromDB); $division->getMaxPercentage();  // ?
[08:06:43] <tw2113> honestly not sure why you'd store percentages in the database when they could easily be calculated at runtime
[08:06:48] <chazy> i have a character table, which has a division column, for every division there's a max percentage
[08:07:00] <__adrian> sounds like you don't need an enum at all
[08:07:19] <__adrian> you'd have a $division, which would have an identifier (first, second, etc.)
[08:07:19] <chazy> should i store it in the db then?
[08:07:22] <Blondie101010> indeed, but also something weird with the DB structure
[08:07:56] <__adrian> and then you'd have a method like getMaxPercentage() that tells you
[08:08:14] <__adrian> echo $div->level(); // "first division"
[08:08:23] <__adrian> echo $div->maxPercentage(); // 90
[08:08:30] <__adrian> ?
[08:08:44] <chazy> yes, that sounds exactly like what i want
[08:08:52] <__adrian> that's all you need then
[08:08:56] <__adrian> no db involved
[08:09:04] <__adrian> no enum involved
[08:09:33] <chazy> now, where would i place this class?
[08:09:35] <__adrian> well, maybe. but not for the percentages
[08:09:40] <__adrian> in your php application
[08:09:51] <chazy> i mean, it's not a Model
[08:09:56] <chazy> or is it?
[08:10:04] <__adrian> isn't it?
[08:10:05] <Blondie101010> I'd also suggest improving your class structure
[08:10:34] <Blondie101010> App\Enums is a red flag
[08:10:38] <__adrian> mm
[08:10:44] <__adrian> like App\Classes
[08:10:57] <__adrian> organize things by function (purpose), not by type
[08:10:59] <chazy> and App\Traits?
[08:11:05] <chazy> oh ok
[08:11:08] <__adrian> booo
[08:11:14] <__adrian> that's like naming your vars $nameString
[08:11:19] <__adrian> $ageInt
[08:11:40] <Blondie101010> a bit different, though related

[08:33:42] <__adrian> sure
[08:33:51] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi
[08:33:55] <__adrian> your $division values might be an enum instead of just a const

[13:08:26] <velix> Sorry for asking, but anyone with an idea, where "php-fqm-cli" lives in Debian?
[13:09:22] <velix> fpm!
[13:10:11] <AllenJB> AFAIK there's no such thing as "php-fpm-cli" - it's either "php-cli" (or just "php") or "php-fpm". FPM and cli are 2 separate ways of running PHP scripts.
[13:10:47] <velix> AllenJB: In my notepad, I've written an example, how to run php files directly in php-fpm.
[13:11:25] <velix> AllenJB: php-fpm-cli -f <file> -q <parameters>
[13:11:33] <velix> maybe it was an external script
[13:11:55] <Naktibalda> try the same with php-cli
[13:12:19] <AllenJB> Pretty sure that's not anything that ships with PHP. Almost certainly a third party script, in which case: Google
[13:12:28] <AllenJB> (or possibly packagist)
[13:12:41] <velix> Naktibalda: Okay. I wanted to read opcache_get_status(). Let's try if normal php can access the opcode-cache
[13:13:03] <Naktibalda> status of fpm daemon?
[13:13:32] <velix> Naktibalda: No, the status of the opcache.
[13:13:36] <velix> Just tried it, doesn't work :D
[13:14:56] <Naktibalda> not surprised
[13:15:17] <AllenJB> Google says: https://github.com/EekoS/php-fpm-cli
[13:15:21] <Naktibalda> so you want FastCGI client which doesn't go through HTTP server
[13:15:59] <velix> AllenJB: I didn't find this, thanks!
[13:16:10] <velix> Naktibalda: ah okay, got it.
[13:16:27] <AllenJB> Alternatively you could just wget / curl a URL that runs through the webserver
[13:16:37] <velix> AllenJB: That's what I've got now :D
[13:16:41] <Naktibalda> that script runs cgi-fcgi binary, make sure that you got it
[13:17:26] <Naktibalda> sudo apt install libfcgi-bin
[13:18:31] <velix> By the way: that caching seems to do well on my system! 461 scripts are cached :D

[15:15:24] <laravelnewbie> hello
[15:15:47] <laravelnewbie> i have a problem in link generation
[15:15:58] <laravelnewbie> this is my code https://wtools.io/paste-code/b8YS

[15:18:43] <AllenJB> file_exists() does not work with HTTP(S) URLs
[15:19:22] <AllenJB> You need to give file_exists() the path of the file on your local filesystem
[15:19:55] <velix> nkm: eah, like AllenJB says. Yould could write site_exists() based on this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/408405/easy-way-to-test-a-url-for-404-in-php
[15:20:07] <velix> But let's pray, it's sending 404 and not "200: error" :D
[15:20:39] <velix> I very often see APIs returning 200 with error messages. This makes me turn evil
[15:20:40] *** Quits: nkm (~laravelne@111.119.177.6) (Quit: Client closed)
[15:21:05] <velix> This is like: "Hello, how are you?" "I'm fine, but I'm ill".
[15:23:07] <AllenJB> If the file is on the local filesystem, you should use that. Making HTTP requests will increase the load on your webserver (which could exacerbate issues if it's already under load)

[15:30:46] <nkm> Hello

[15:32:02] <AllenJB> file_exists() does not work with HTTP(S) URLs. You need to give file_exists() the path of the file on your local filesystem
[15:32:21] <nkm> okay
[15:32:47] <nkm> is there any other option available for this kinnk of urls?
[15:33:21] <nkm> kind*
[15:33:36] <AllenJB> You could use a HTTP client (eg. curl or guzzle) and check if the response is 404. But if the file is on the local filesystem, you should use that. Making HTTP requests will increase the load on your webserver (which could exacerbate issues if it's already under load)
[15:34:18] <nkm> okay
[15:34:33] <AllenJB> It's also possible that you might get a response back which doesn't indicate whether the file / URL definitely exists or not (due to network issues or issues on the destination server, for example)

[22:54:09] <biberu> chazy: both what? strength and accuracy?
[22:54:12] <chazy> yes

[22:54:53] <biberu> what's the relationship between them?
[22:54:57] <chazy> in terms of performance, wouldn't it be better to only check this when current stats (str+acc) is equal or greater than max_stats?
[22:55:39] <chazy> the relationship is that str+acc is used to calculate (cross multiplication) the winning percentage
[22:56:07] <biberu> performance isn't a problem until it's a problem, it's usually better to focus on what's correct and understandable
[22:56:17] <chazy> ok
[22:56:51] <biberu> is an extra addition a likely bottleneck for you?
[22:58:03] <chazy> what addition?
[22:58:31] <biberu> whichever, it's some trivial calculation

[23:00:10] <biberu> if you don't have reason to think it will be, then you aren't spending brain power on your real problem
[23:01:09] <chazy> i'm sorry i don't understand the question, do you mean if it's a problem for me to add an extra calculation?
[23:01:30] <biberu> you seem worried about performance
[23:02:15] <__adrian> meaning if you don't have a performance problem, don't spend time solving one. and if you do have a performance problem, the solution is NOT less basic arithmetic. guarantee that's not the part that takes too long.
[23:02:34] <chazy> not that much, just trying to make the code efficient
[23:02:56] <biberu> make it correct instead
[23:03:56] <biberu> chasing optimizations at that level will just distract you from the real problem

[23:04:29] <biberu> make it work, make it right, make it understandable
[23:04:56] * Blondie101010 nods
[23:05:07] <__adrian> "biberu> make it correct instead"  this.
[23:26:19] <Nekomander> chazy, why are stats random? Using my approach, even with random EXP points, such code can still be useful for that case.
[23:28:38] <Nekomander> Each minute, the character can gain a random amount of EXP. If enough EXP is accumulated, they'll level up a stat. There is a maximum capacity of how much EXP the character can hold for a stat (essentially, max level)
