[05:44:36] *** Joins: capn (~capn@user/capn)
[05:47:59] <flatcap> hi rsaavedra 
[05:48:44] <flatcap> unfortunately not.  neomutt doesn't save a copy, but...
[05:48:57] <flatcap> you can configure vim to do that
[05:50:19] <flatcap> I have the vim config:
[05:50:23] <flatcap> set backupdir=~/.cache/vim/backup//
[05:50:26] <flatcap> set directory=~/.cache/vim/swap//
[05:50:28] <flatcap> set undodir=~/.cache/vim/undo//
[05:50:30] <flatcap> set viewdir=~/.cache/vim/view//
[05:51:24] <flatcap> the backupdir saves a copy of everything you edit (you'll need to clean it out periodically)
[05:52:58] <flatcap> the undodir allows you to do magic!  if you edit a file, then quit, the edit it later, you can undo back into the first editing session

[15:27:01] <flatcap> morning all
[15:38:10] <flatcap> dcpurton: I hope my instructions weren't too confusing
[15:38:22] <dcpurton> morning!
[15:38:26] <dcpurton> I think I can follow
[15:38:26] <flatcap> They seemed so clear in my head, until I tried to articulate them
[15:38:41] <dcpurton> I'm just doing some tidying up
[15:38:45] <dcpurton> I have a question though
[15:38:55] <flatcap> yes?
[15:39:26] <dcpurton> the (oddly named) function update_idx() in compose/functions.c appends an attachment
[15:39:36] <dcpurton> I need to be able to insert
[15:39:48] <dcpurton> so I wrote an insert_idx() function
[15:40:24] *** Joins: Pali (~pali@user/pali)
[15:40:28] <flatcap> ok
[15:40:38] <dcpurton> update_idx() calls mutt_actx_add_attach() from somewhere
[15:40:55] <dcpurton> so again I wrote a mutt_actx_ins_attach()
[15:41:40] <dcpurton> but then I modified mutt_actx_add_attach() mutt_actx_ins_attach()
[15:41:57] <dcpurton> errrm
[15:42:21] <dcpurton> I mean I made mutt_actx_add_attach just call my new mutt_actx_ins_attach()
[15:42:38] <dcpurton> If I were starting from scratch
[15:42:59] <dcpurton> I'd only use the insert functions and call them everywhere directly
[15:43:34] * flatcap looks at functions and their callers...
[15:43:35] <dcpurton> but this would mean removing update_idx() and mutt_actx_add_attach()
[15:44:01] <dcpurton> And I don't know if that's desirable or not
[15:46:35] <dcpurton> mutt_actx_add_attach is called in receiving stuff too I think
[15:48:59] <flatcap> yes, I think they're desirable, but not yet
[15:49:35] <flatcap> let's get this PR stable and merged, then we can radically refactor the attachment handling :-)
[15:51:21] <dcpurton> OK, I'll leave that structure as it is at present
[15:51:45] <dcpurton> Another question
[15:52:18] <dcpurton> some helper functions in compose/functions.c are prefixed with `compose_`. Some are not. Do you have a preference for the new ones?
[15:52:46] <flatcap> good, that's simpler :-)
[15:52:50] <dcpurton> e.g., the aforementioned `update_idx()`
[15:53:24] <dcpurton> and `compose_attach_swap()`
[15:53:34] <flatcap> generally, any functions that are shared (outside their library) are generally of the form: LIBARAY_OBJECT_ACTION()
[15:53:56] <dcpurton> and that would only be true if in a header file, right?
[15:54:02] <flatcap> yeah
[15:54:18] <flatcap> if they're only used in compose, then you can use your discretion
[15:54:44] <dcpurton> OK
[15:54:48] <flatcap> (though I'd prefer if they are unique, since I create a lot of function call diagrams)

[18:15:26] <dcpurton> yeah?
[18:15:30] <flatcap> any idea what the AttachCtx->v2r, ->vcount are being used for?
[18:15:36] <dcpurton> haha
[18:15:53] <flatcap> in the (email) Context, it's a virtual lookup
[18:16:02] <dcpurton> they pop up in the original compose code, somewhere, right?
[18:16:12] <flatcap> that allows us to sort the Emails, or limit them without altering the original array
[18:16:20] <flatcap> yeah, there and recvattach
[18:16:30] <flatcap> but we don't sort or limit the attachments
[18:16:36] <dcpurton> I *think* it's only relevant if you collapse attchments
[18:16:43] <flatcap> oh!
[18:16:57] <flatcap> I'd forgotten we could do that
[18:16:58] <dcpurton> which you can't do in compose menu
[18:17:02] <flatcap> that makes sense
[18:17:05] <dcpurton> I think…
[18:17:58] <flatcap> yes 'v' <collapse-parts> - toggle display of subparts
[18:18:02] <flatcap> thanks
[18:19:25] <dcpurton> I don't think there's any need to allow the tree to collapse while composing
[18:19:30] <dcpurton> so I just ignored it
[18:19:53] <flatcap> yeah, fair enough
[18:20:01] <dcpurton> the only function that used it in the original code was delete_attachment()
[18:20:05] <dcpurton> But I don't know why
[18:20:29] <flatcap> ok
[18:20:30] <dcpurton>   int ridx = actx->v2r[aidx];
[18:20:41] *** Quits: strajder (~strajder@user/strajder) (Quit: leaving)
[18:20:42] <dcpurton> should always return aidx when composing
[18:20:52] <flatcap> yes
[18:21:10] <dcpurton> and the rest of the code assumes it does
[18:21:16] <dcpurton> maybe I should just remove the line
[18:21:43] <flatcap> yeah, I think so.  it just add confusion otherwise
[18:22:03] <dcpurton> it was probably a copy/paste from somewhere in the past
[18:22:26] <flatcap> I've been busily writing down lots of questions about Body/AttachPtr/AttachCtx -- trying to figure out what I actually understand
[18:22:51] <dcpurton> I understand a lot more now than when I started
[18:23:10] <dcpurton> But I'm puzzled by the need to track AttachPtr->num while composing
[18:24:07] <flatcap> hmm... that sounds like another Index thing
[18:24:11] * flatcap looks at Email
[18:25:12] <flatcap> Email->msgno is the index number shown to the user
[18:25:23] <dcpurton> Maybe useful while reading and when groups are collapsed
[18:25:44] <flatcap> ah, yes
[18:26:06] <flatcap> the number doesn't change when lines are hidden
[18:26:08] <dcpurton> ooo - maybe it does use that to display the number in the attachment list
[18:26:51] <flatcap> hmm... it doesn't seems to do what I thought
[18:27:01] * flatcap tries the last release
[18:28:27] <flatcap> master, last release and mutt all behave the same way...
[18:29:01] <flatcap> if you fold some attachments, then the later attachments get renumbered
[18:29:47] <flatcap> doing the same with emails, the later emails' numbers are fixed
[18:32:18] * flatcap makes a note: folding attachments could do with some visual feedback
[18:33:32] <flatcap> folding and attachment group makes the hidden attachments inaccessible...
[18:34:08] <flatcap> if you fold an email group, then <jump>NUMBER will allow you to jump to a hidden email (and auto-open the fold)
[18:34:26] <dcpurton> this is while reading, right?
[18:34:31] <flatcap> yes
[18:34:45] <flatcap> because of the renumbering, you can't jump into a folded attach group
[18:34:45] <dcpurton> Ah - that's not my fault ;)
[18:34:52] <flatcap> nope, that's historic
[18:35:23] <flatcap> another item on the not-today-todo-list
[18:35:56] <dcpurton> OK, I'm going to quit for the day
[18:36:11] <dcpurton> I think the current code is mostly in good order
[18:36:28] <flatcap> yeah, it looks good.  I'll try to understand it all now
[18:36:32] <dcpurton> I'll have a go at your rebasing and reordering tomorrow

[20:36:11] <gour> hello, afaik, notmuch feature does not work with nntp, but wonder if with the mail it works similar to emacs interface or what would be the advantage of using it within emacs?

[20:56:20] <flatcap> yes, notmuch only works with local mail, but that's the limit of my knowledge

[21:13:56] <jindraj> about nntp with neomutt+notmuch - it has been asked here several times. I remember apetresc did some work on tool to make it possible: https://github.com/apetresc/dot/tree/master/modules/newsmutt
[21:22:12] <flatcap> bremner: can notmuch/xapian use arbitrary keys for the emails?
[21:22:32] <flatcap> I came up with a scheme once for neomutt+imap+notmuch
[21:22:43] <bremner> flatcap: what are "keys" here?
[21:22:54] <flatcap> we'd read new emails when then arrive, and present them to notmuch for indexing...
[21:23:21] <flatcap> but rather than a file path as a key, we'd offer an imap:// address
[21:24:08] <bremner> ah. that kind of key. No, notmuch needs files. Xapian is more flexible, but that requires programming
[21:24:32] <flatcap> ah, shame!
[21:24:54] <flatcap> it'd be a *load* of work on the neomutt side, too, but I wondered if it were possible
[21:25:39] <flatcap> does the email file need to exist after notmuch has scanned it?
[21:26:20] * flatcap is wondering if I can create files with some odd encoded names :-)
[21:28:15] <bremner> it needs to exist when "notmuch new" is run, otherwise it is detected as a deletion
[21:29:17] <flatcap> yeah, we'd have to forbid `notmuch new`
[21:29:19] <flatcap> ok, thanks

[21:31:29] <bremner> someone(TM) could teach notmuch-new to ignore deletions, I guess
[21:32:21] <flatcap> is there a library function to "notmuch new" on a specific set of files?
[21:32:32] <bremner> no
[21:32:44] <bremner> not much of notmuch-new lives in the library
[21:33:01] <flatcap> ok, fair enough
[21:33:10] <bremner> It does have a configurable ignore, so it could be hacked with a shell script
[21:34:10] <flatcap> interesting...  anyway, enough diversions, I'm busy enough already :-)
[21:34:11] <flatcap> thanks
[21:37:06] <bremner> sure.

[21:53:51] <gour> bremner: have you thought about something like https://neomutt.org/feature/quasi-delete ?
[21:54:42] <bremner> gour: it sounds like how tagging with an excluded tag already works in notmuch

[21:56:34] <bremner> so I don't know what the idea is there. Add some tagging shortcut to mutt?
[21:58:13] <gour> i'd have to try...neomutt has some features like nntp...although i'll try to make setup for emacs
[21:58:37] *** Quits: gabriel1__ (~gabriel1@5.170.101.31) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:59:12] <gour> probably notmuch does function much naturally within emacs 😄
[21:59:41] <bremner> dunno. These things tend to be a matter of taste, and what you are already used to.
[22:04:46] <gour> bremner: you've created and use emacs interface?
[22:05:50] <bremner> many people have contributed, me less than several others
[22:05:58] <bremner> but yes, I use it
