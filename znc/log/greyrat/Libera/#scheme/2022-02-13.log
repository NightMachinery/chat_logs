[17:54:25] <sham1> Since there are still bikesheds to colour in, one thing I'd like to discuss is documentation. Now currently, there is no real way of documenting functions and the like within the language itself, aside from comments. This is in contrast to for example how CL and Python (also some Scheme implementations like Guile) have docstrings and how some languages like Java and Rust use special comments for documenting functions and other identifiers
[17:54:56] <sham1> The thing I'd like to focus on is how that could be made to interact with the R7 libraries

[17:56:13] <sham1> So say one has a docstring thing, and decides to attach it onto an identifier. First of all, this seems to be the way one would do it, but there's still questions about it.
[17:57:40] <sham1> Would any interrogation of a symbol's docs sync up with symbol renaming that's done during imports. Also, would duplicates matter? Or IOW, would you only find docs for currently imported symbols
[17:58:37] <dpk> it would make sense to attach documentation to a binding rather than the name

[18:28:08] <Oxyd> I'm not sure attaching documentation to run-time things like the way to go. Ideally you'd want a tool that can turn your Scheme code into HTML or whatever format without having to execute the module you're documenting.
[18:38:36] <sham1> I suppose, although I find for example CL's DESCRIBE useful when I'm doing stuff with that on the REPL
[18:40:04] <Oxyd> It's a neat party trick, but when working in Python, I definitely prefer just opening the documentation on the web instead of using help in the REPL, even if I already have a REPL open.

[19:46:56] <sham1> Currying I'd imagine
[19:47:16] <Zipheir> pinoaffe: In a somewhat loose sense, it allows you to define curried procedures.
[19:49:09] <Zipheir> pinoaffe: Unlike traditional Scheme currying, you can treat them as anything from 1-ary to k-ary.  e.g. (define (foo x y z) (+ x y z)) can be applied (foo 1 2 3), ((foo 1) 2 3), (((foo 1) 2) 3), etc.
[19:50:19] <pinoaffe> Zipheir: wait so are you talking about lambda* as in https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/lambda_002a-and-define_002a.html?
[19:50:29] <sham1> No
[19:50:31] <pinoaffe> because I feel like going from optional args to currying is still a bit of a step
[19:50:31] <Zipheir> pinoaffe: No.  Name collision.
[19:50:33] <sham1> That's different
[19:50:51] <pinoaffe> that explains my confusion :)
[19:51:21] <Zipheir> The name was Jason Hemann/Dan Friedman's idea, and I'd like a better one.
[19:52:55] <pinoaffe> a syntactic form that allows for defining implicitly curried functions would be quite neat
[19:53:40] <pinoaffe> but yeah, I'd also like some thing other than define*
[19:53:57] <pinoaffe> correction, lambda*
[19:55:13] <pinoaffe> maybe another symbol to affix to lambda? (or would that cause compatibility issues)
[19:55:50] <Zipheir> I've offered lambda-c and kappa, neither of which are wonderful IMO.
[19:56:34] <sham1> mu
[19:57:22] <Zipheir> 'mu' certainly wins the brevity award!  But it's not very curry-flavored.
[19:58:22] <Zipheir> pinoaffe: Obviously the Right Symbol is sham1's curry and rice emoji.  Any choice of ASCII symbol is bound to be weird.

[20:18:04] <ski> reals are complicated beasts. especially computationally. e.g. to begin with, do you want Cauchy reals or Dedekind reals ?

[20:18:57] <ASau> ski: I'd say that constructive reals are even more confusing, if you ever get to the result on comparison.
[20:19:21] <ASau> (I always forget whose, Kolmogorov's, Markov's...)

[20:21:31] <pinoaffe> ASau: I'm fairly certain that they talk about "a == 0.0" since this is likely to cause issues in students code, but I'm not sure what that has to do with philosophy of science
[20:22:11] <ski> (and algorithmic isn't the same notion as computable. the former requires that there's a finite description, a program, that computes the thing. the latter only requires that it's computable. e.g. if you assume that you can get a temperature reading, then that stream is computable, without having to assume that the universe is algorithmic)
[20:23:07] <Zipheir> ski: Yes.  Unfortunately, those terms get mixed up a lot.
[20:23:28] <ASau> pinoaffe: that has something to do with algorithms they implement or with the ways they implement said algorithms, I can't recall details.
[20:24:23] <ski> (when you're adding Cauchy sequences (sequences of rational numbers, converging to a real number), you do not need to assume the sequences are algorithmic. that is a redundant assumption. you only need to assume they're computable, that you can compute as (finitely) many approximants in the sequence as you like)
[20:25:23] <ASau> ski: I just want to point that the notion of computability you use is disputable.
[20:26:41] <ski> yea, i agree it's a bit vague. and perhaps, the universe is actually algorithmic, so that it would coincide with algorithmic
[20:27:23] <ski> but it seems to me to be ueful to make this distinction. or did you have some other problem in mind ?

[22:33:22] <sham1> Ah yes
[22:33:27] <jcowan> I think my comment on the dual inclusion (this is not an official chair ruling, and I invite comment) is this: that some compliant Yellow Schemes will support syntax-case efficiently and ER quadratically, and others will support syntax-case quadratically and ER linearly. and that this is not a disastrous state of affairs.
[22:34:33] <dpk> i think quadratic expansion is one of the things that advocates of both systems would not be happy to see in their own
[22:35:07] <sham1> How much would quadratic expandature affect in practice?
[22:35:09] <dpk> more serious is the semantic issue with syntax-case implementations where only identifiers/symbols carry scope information which M N-W found

[22:36:02] <jcowan> sham1: it depends on how hairy your macros are
[22:36:33] <jcowan> also syntax-rules will always be expanded linearly (unless the implementation is deliberately perverse).
[22:37:52] <sham1> Well I suppose
[22:38:06] <dpk> i also think adopting a specification which requires quadratic expansion time for any macro system would be a tremendous shame after all the research, specifically directed at Scheme, which has specifically gone into the development of hygienic macro systems which *don't* take quadratic time

[22:45:19] <jcowan> dpk: So tell me if this restatement of your objection is correcct and complete:
[22:47:46] <jcowan> "The current ballot result, in which syntax-case and ER are both to be included in R7RS, is subject to the objection that there is no known method for making both systems linear: one must always be quadratic.  This may produce inheerently slow macroexpansion when macros of both types are included in a single program, presumably because they come from different sources."
[22:51:26] <dpk> i have three points: the first is technical, that syntax-case and explicit renaming cannot be made to interoperate within a Scheme implementation without semantic compromises and/or performance issues (note your summary mentions only the latter). the second is political: that 70% (for syntax-case) + 37.5% (for explicit renaming) is only 7.5%, thus i conclude that only a tiny minority of voters actually want two low-level macro systems. (you 
[22:51:26] <dpk> don't mention this). the third is rhetorical: that quadratic macro expansion has historically been deemed so undesirable as to warrant a large amount of research into how to avoid it, so it would be a shame (i would even say âun-Schemicâ by analogy to âun-Pythonicâ if there were such a thing) to adopt a specification which required it
[22:52:29] <dpk> err, only 107.5%. but i'm waiting to see the actual votes ;-)
