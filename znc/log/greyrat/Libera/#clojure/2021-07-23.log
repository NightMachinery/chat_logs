[13:08:31] <sobel> market share charts, or as i like to call them, market sharts
[13:15:37] <EdwardIII> ah ha, yes, market sharts
[13:22:39] <EdwardIII> sobel: are you in london? if so do you go to the london clojuians meetups? a lot of good talks seem to come out of there
[13:25:21] <sobel> nope. i live in texas.
[13:25:42] <EdwardIII> you're up early, no?
[13:26:00] <sobel> my lame claim to fame is sharing a room with david nolan at a local clojure meeting
[13:26:15] <sobel> EdwardIII: i have insomnia, it's always/never late/early
[13:26:41] <sobel> so i guess i've been to two clojure meetups
[13:28:09] <EdwardIII> i used to go to a LUG which apparently alan cox would visit sometimes, never caught him there though
[13:28:20] <EdwardIII> which is even lamer
[13:28:31] <sobel> haha, in my 20s i was a walking LUG
[13:29:10] <sobel> i was "that guy" ready to evangelize at the drop of a hat, especially to windows-oriented folks
[13:29:32] <wink> those are the worst people :P
[13:30:37] <sobel> at least linux advocacy is justified today. when i was doing it, linux was horrible.
[13:31:11] <wink> I probably wouldn't agree even if I knew what time you think of
[13:31:27] <sobel> 1997
[13:31:57] <sobel> it was scarely better than win95
[13:32:25] <sobel> more secure? nope. less buggy? eh. app support? weeeeell.
[13:32:38] <EdwardIII> like ex smokers
[13:33:36] <wink> I ran Linux on servers just fine from 99 on, but I haven't experienced it in 97
[13:34:08] <wink> but with your windows comment.. yeah, no idea. I only started using it with a gui regularly a few years later
[13:34:17] <sobel> i switched to openbsd then freebsd around '99 and became *even more* smug
[13:34:57] <sobel> hindsight was brutal, though. none of that software was even vaguely secure.
[13:35:00] <wink> I'm just saying I'm against evangelizing :P people have reasons to use windows and it's fine. showing them an alternative is fine, of course
[13:35:20] <sobel> oh yeah, i've reformed since then quite a bit
[13:35:21] <wink> well back then the mac thing also worked. so few users that no one bothered to attack it
[13:35:41] <wink> osx also wasn't secure per se from the get-go. it was just not an interesting target
[13:36:11] <sobel> i was a mac advocate in the 80s but then it was a matter of being an actual child and being pretty much on fire about the first cool machine i had mastered :)
[13:37:02] <EdwardIII> i think i installed slack around '99. first thing i discovered was that my crappy wintel modem was not compatible :) a familiar story haha
[13:37:11] <sobel> i still advocate, but now i try to keep it abstract: privacy, liberty, right to repair, right to travel, etc
[13:37:35] <sobel> EdwardIII: my first install was from a tall stack of slackware floppies
[13:37:49] <sobel> omg so many floppies
[13:38:14] <sobel> usually labeled with sharpie, because who bothers to attach 100+ adhesive labels
[13:38:38] <sobel> there was always that one maniac who insisted he'd just keep his disks in order
[13:38:41] <sobel> no labels
[13:39:06] <EdwardIII> i remmeber the guys at college downloading pirated, modernish games, then writing them onto dozens of floppies to take home (no CDROM drives at the college)
[13:39:31] <EdwardIII> actual 3D games like delta force (but with cutscenes and some audio removed to reduce the filesize). pretty funny
[13:40:02] <EdwardIII> then the next day they're in a bad mood because it turns out one of the 22 disks had a bad sector 
[13:42:36] <sobel> ISTR my first linux install was around 90 disks
[13:42:42] <EdwardIII> wooooow
[13:42:56] <EdwardIII> no internet access?
[13:43:30] <sobel> that's not how it worked in 1997
[13:45:03] <EdwardIII> i thought you americans were all cruising the information superhighway with free local calls from '95 onwards :)

[13:49:19] <sobel> even today broadband access is very poorly distributed. i'm super lucky to have gbit fiber now, but just a few miles away in nicer neighborhoods they can't do better than DSL
[13:49:52] <sobel> being in a wealthy neighborhood almost guarnteed you would get screwed for broadband in the early days
[13:50:51] <sobel> in my city the local cable company was so utterly incompetent at delivering broadband, we were stuck with 10mbit and maybe 30% uptime
[13:50:54] <sobel> years
[13:51:19] <EdwardIII> wealthy = LESS amenities? whyso?
[13:51:43] <sobel> monopoly players dominated those areas
[13:52:09] <sobel> areas served by smaller ISPs were more competitive, albeit for a smaller piece of the pie
[13:53:32] <sobel> i hate when i visit my parents in their now-rich neighborhood, and have to deal with their AT&T DSL problems for them. rather live with working people and have gbit fiber.
