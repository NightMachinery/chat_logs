[00:04:13] <ayecee> windows isn't the guest
[00:04:15] <bocaneri> If you run a Linux guest on a Windows host, you're still subject to Windows' propensity for frequent updates and reboots. Same applies if you rely on WSL. I would prefer to run Windows as the guest under a Linux host.

[03:04:06] <bocaneri> SSH to server A. No password because did the ssh-copy-id thing. From server A, ssh-copy-id to server B. Next time you SSH from A to B, you don't need a password. Disable password login on server B, naturally.
[03:04:35] <ayecee> you're missing a ssh-keygen step in between
[03:04:49] <bocaneri> Yes, I am. I don't remember everything I did, but you get what I'm saying.
[03:04:55] <ayecee> yup
[03:06:08] <ayecee> the advantage of using the agent for this is that the authentication material remains on one host, but that way can be convenient too.

[03:07:50] <Psi-Jack> Once you use it, whomever has root access on the destination server can then thus use your ssh key to gain access to another server, as you.

[03:08:52] <ayecee> you could in theory have an ssh-agent that prompted you when a new request came in, but that's not how it works normally

[03:09:33] <Psi-Jack> This is literally using your own ssh key to login and authenticate as you, specifically.
[03:09:47] <ayecee> but evil root hijacking the agent could have access to more keys, i guess.

[03:25:21] <Shortstop> Hey there, I got an issue with Manjaro not booting correctly. I recently installed Debian 10 with Open Media Vault purely on a flash drive. I made it so that GRUB for my manjaro HDD would recognize both distros --> Manjaro on its own HDD, and Debian 10 on the USB Flash Drive. The problem I'm running into is that its the Debian 10 based GRUB menu that appears, and if I try to boot into Manjaro, I get

[04:07:10] <zorin> Hello.  Er, I may have accidentally some files.  :-D  I was trying to copy the entire home folder of a crashed hard disk, and it wouldn't copy most of the files because there wasn't permission.  So I did a chmod to change the permissions.  But I don't really know what I'm doing with chmod.  I ran 'sudo chmod -R --reference="/home/zorin/Desktop/Text File.txt" /media/zorin/3dc5e75a-6344-4b4c-b89d-5a3864c49fdf/home/ab', with the reference file

[04:45:44] <Khaytsus> it's a 32 bit OS
[04:45:47] <Dagmar> It's not 2003 anymore.
[04:45:56] <bocaneri> It ran like crap on 4 GB and runs very well on 8. Don't know what the story is here.
[04:46:07] <Khaytsus> Nonsense story
[04:46:13] <Dagmar> One should generally be able to expect 85-95% bare metal speed with a decent type-1 hypervisor
[04:46:16] <Khaytsus> Unless it's XP 64, which was uncommon...
[04:46:21] <bocaneri> Maybe I'll tinker with that next time I take a break.
[04:46:34] <zorin> Hm, apparently my laptop has 16GB, didn't know it had that much.
[04:46:45] * bocaneri checks some configs
[04:47:21] <Shortstop> dang, how annoying. I reinstalled grub while in Manjaro, and its still giving me the Debian 10 grub menu. Yikes man
[04:47:51] <Psi-Jack> Sucks to run multiple distros with multiple different ones installing their own grub in the same spot.
[04:48:05] <[[R]]> s/multiple.*//
[04:48:11] <Psi-Jack> Here's the real question.
[04:48:15] <Psi-Jack> WHY are you doing this at all>?
[04:48:29] <Shortstop> to be fair
[04:48:37] <Khaytsus> D I S T R O H O P
[04:48:43] <Shortstop> I wanted just Debian 10 on a flash drive so I can occasionally boot into Open Media Vault
[04:48:45] <Shortstop> that's about it
[04:48:45] <[[R]]> Khaytsus: are you a bunny rabbit?
[04:48:58] <Psi-Jack> So.
[04:49:02] <Khaytsus> [[R]]: Hop, hop, hop.
[04:49:03] <Psi-Jack> You have it. On a USB dribe?
[04:49:04] <Shortstop> that way I can sync HDD's across my network with a web page, and shut down the machine with a few clicks
[04:49:11] <Shortstop> yeah
[04:49:13] <Psi-Jack> ...
[04:49:24] <Psi-Jack> Easy solution. Stop this madness.
[04:49:26] <Shortstop> works like a charm, its just this GRUB BS sucks when I actually want to switch to Manjaro on the same machine
[04:49:37] <Khaytsus> You can run OMV in a vm, probably in docker, whatever

[04:50:14] <Shortstop> I did think of that to be totally honest
[04:50:20] <Khaytsus> Shortstop: why would you need that?  nfs etc
[04:50:30] <Shortstop> what's nfs?
[04:50:33] <bocaneri> I never thought to check that. You're right, Windows believes it only has 4GB of ram. Reconfig time!
[04:50:38] <Psi-Jack> Why do you even use Open Media Vault as a usb device at all? It's not intended to be run that way.
[04:50:44] <Khaytsus> Are you serious
[04:50:49] <Shortstop> bocaneri: yeah XP had that limitation
[04:51:06] <Shortstop> Khaytsus: man, I don't know every acronym, what
[04:51:19] <Khaytsus> You want to run a NAS, but odn't know what NFS is.

[05:21:53] <Sauvin> What's the LiveUSB OS?
[05:21:58] <pnbeast> zorin, that clarifies things, I think.  The chmod was probably a mistake.  The live OS probably (almost certainly) has different userids than the OS that was used with the disk.  In the live OS, it would probably have been best to become root, then try to rsync your target data to another physical storage medium.

[05:22:14] <Shortstop> this is a weird question, but while I boot into Debian 10 on that machine as a specific hostname, I can then set my router settings so that when it sees 'debian10' for example to specifically allocate a static IP address?

[05:22:51] <Dagmar> Shortstop: Depends upon the dhcpd implementation, but the hostname identifier is a common one to use for that.  Better would be the ethernet MAC becasue it will not change

[05:55:20] <Sauvin> As I understood it, a home directory and every little itty bitty bit under it.
[05:55:34] <Dagmar> It seemed like the goal was to copy the files to some external media, but the method that was planned was deeply flawed.

[07:06:46] <Sauvin> Or even, in critical directories, incrond. :D

[07:07:14] <Shortstop> zorin: I'm not sure. Honestly, why don't you just grab what's important and put it on a flash drive, and profit?
[07:07:33] <Shortstop> i've been in the same exact scenario, you just need to grab the important stuff and move it off the computer, thats it
[07:07:41] <Shortstop> next step after that, get a file server going with backups
[07:07:44] <catbeard> so rsync.net has a special borgbackup package
[07:07:45] <Sauvin> zorin: find -type d -exec chmod a+x {} \; # is what I do, forgot the exact syntax for + instead of \ at the end
[07:07:50] <catbeard> not listed on their website
[07:07:57] <catbeard> you have to find it via the borgbackup documentation :)
[07:07:58] <tangledwire> do you guys know about git annex?
[07:08:04] <zorin> Like I say, there's a lot of files to check through, and I now don't know whether the ones I did "find . -type d -exec chmod a+x {} +" on are corrupted somehow or not.
[07:08:10] <catbeard> but very cheap and effective for off-site encrypted incremental backups
[07:08:12] <Shortstop> catbeard: I plan on using SyncThing as an alternative

[07:49:04] <pnbeast> n4dir, no, that's hornets.  They'll mostly let you alone if you let them alone.  Yellow jackets come out of the box angry.
[07:49:06] <Sauvin> My personal experience? Yellowjackets means immediately reaching for the spray can.

[07:49:31] <zorin> Fact is, it's really painful for me to use the computer without the accessibility mods (like when I'm using it with the LiveUSB), especially the browser, so I didn't do any looking up, I just guessed.  Nine times out of ten, I get away with that, this was the tenth.

[09:49:12] <pnbeast> I think to make an altium you need an average of 4 to 5 f.luxes.  But you can design an altium without using any f.luxes at all.  You don't have to give a f.lux.

[12:50:34] <Guest84_> Actually few weeks ago I set an hdd password for one my 2.5'' hdds using bios and couple days ago I tried to boot into that hdd but ound out that I forgot the password. Googled it for last few days and got convinced that my data is gone and no way I can access it without remembering the password. Anyway I am quite okay with wiping it and formatting it and reusing it. But I don't know if it's possible or not.
[12:50:50] <Guest84_> i didn't set a password for the bios itself, actually i set a password for the disk.

[14:03:08] <Steffen13> Hi, i installed lineageos on a galaxy s10 5g. I think i have a problem with the encryption. I never get asked for a password when i get in recovery (TWRP). And when i update it  with phone update menu everytime the log shows in TWRP me can,t open all the data premission denied. And after intall lineageos i get in bootloop. Then i have to update
[14:03:08] <Steffen13> with usb stick and everytime to install opengapps. Then lineageos starts. Can somebody help me?
[14:04:06] <MrElendig> you are better off asking in their channel

[14:11:24] <SpearRaven> is there linux remote SSL protection software that stops processing login attempts ('number of attempts' + 'time') that does nothing except will make the attacker think that the password was wrong even if they or the program guessed the correct one after a programmed number of attempts over a set period of time? Example -- 5 wrong attempts in 5 minutes triggers the application. If it could log IP or IP range, even better.

[18:40:14] <tirnanog> after all, it's safer to define the exceptions to the overall rule in that case, rather than leaving the INPUT chain wide open and trying to plug the leaks, as it were.

[23:45:03] <Guest86> hello, I borked my debian drive, I have live ubuntu running on the machine and I'm trying to just mount the drive so I can recover my data on there, it appears to be a "LVM2" and any attempt to mount the partitions gives "cannot allocate memory" error... any advice?
[23:45:27] <ayecee> how are you trying to mount them
[23:45:35] <Guest86> 'mount'
[23:45:37] <Aarch64debian> cloudserver is paid service
[23:45:41] <ayecee> what is the rest of your mount command

[23:46:28] <tomreyn> Guest86: how much ram does this system have?
[23:46:50] <legend> Aarch64debian: why are you mentioning "cloud server"
[23:47:03] <ayecee> Guest86: reason i ask is, you can't mount lvm partitions, they're not filesystems. so i'd like to see if that's what you're doing, or if you're doing something else and describing it weird.
[23:47:04] <Guest86> its a 112gb ssd and it shows 2 111gb partitions, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda5 (/dev/sda1 is mountable but it is just the boot partition I think?) I tried mounting both of those via 'mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/main'
[23:47:07] <Aarch64debian> cloud.hyper.....

[23:47:52] <ayecee> Guest86: okay. you'd mount logical volumes that are contained on that lvm pv. run "lvdisplay" to show current logical volumes.
