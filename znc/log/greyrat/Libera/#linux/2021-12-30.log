[04:46:20] <tirnanog> if you're walking symlinks that cannot current be resolved, the only solution is really: don't do that. a bind mount might help you, depending on the exact circumstances.
[04:47:06] <tirnanog> for example, if you have a dead link whose target is to /tmp/foo, bind mount the relevant path to /tmp/foo so that the target can now be resolved.

[04:49:14] <tirnanog> asbachb: you can possibly run namei -l on the path of one of these broken symlinks to show how it really is? it would help for me to understand.

[05:04:15] <tirnanog> stepping back for a moment, do you really need to follow the symlinks for the purposes of your archive? can't you just store them as symlinks and later assume that the targets will be in place? this is how tar normally works, for example.
[05:04:16] <asbachb> I guess I just create a new image based on that image, run the container, zip the stuff and copy it out of the container

[05:32:41] <gothicserpent> anyone familiar with swapfiles in linux, as enabled by mkswap and swapon? If I set swappiness low: `sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10` preventing too many swap hits, is it true that a swap file will not create a large slowdown in my digital ocean VM? My applications don't really ever reach the memory base maximum and only in rare events exceed it needing swap, but I wanted to use swap to prevent for the
[05:32:43] <gothicserpent> process becoming a runaway and killing my other processes as a result. Is swap a good solution here?

[05:34:42] <eof> gothicserpent: if you knock the swapiness all the way down you won't see much swap usage
[05:35:05] <gothicserpent> ok. it's at 30 now, but a digital ocean tech is telling me to avoid swap and upgrade to a larger droplet.. go figure..
[05:35:11] <eof> stuff will end up there, but usually never anything that gets accessed
[05:35:12] <gothicserpent> should i not listen to him?
[05:35:20] <gothicserpent> i figured as much!
[05:35:29] <tirnanog> gothicserpent: activating swap doesn't magically slow things down. if you're worried, consider collecting metrics for your paging rate both in and out. if you get to the point that your workloads constantly incur a high rate of paging activity, then that's the point at which you should pay for a host with more RAM, ideally.
[05:35:35] <eof> ^
[05:36:11] <eof> gothicserpent: really if you find yourself asking the question of a DO tech perhaps it has gotten to the point where you need to evaluate your workload's resource requirements
[05:36:55] <gothicserpent> my centos 8 droplet top command outputted 800 MiB ram when I signed up for 1 Gib, turns out its how centos 8 is deployed on DO, that was the initial reason i talked to DO.
[05:37:22] <gothicserpent> my procs hover around 250-500 MiB, only in extreme rarities get above 500 (it's a weechat-headless daemon for my irc use)
[05:37:33] <tirnanog> as for that tech, he might well be wearing a salesman hat in the course of giving advice (rather than analysing your precise usage metrics and requirements).
[05:37:33] <gothicserpent> i wanted a fallback in case the buffer gets overrun

[07:32:23] <mlu> easy as in: low-effort at scale
[07:32:37] <Blondie101010> some effort is required to set things up but then you can configure the check periods, frequency, escalations, aknowledgements, etc, etc
[07:32:50] <mlu> but yeah, if you need to ask and you think building your own is reasonable, it's worth it to do it once so you can evaluate how good the other dashboards are
[07:33:18] <ananke> scale of '2 systems' means return on investment is very low, regardless of what tools you're going to pick

[07:34:50] <TheGuestMovie> mlu: nah, not unless I change careers. I'd love to switch from software development to devops, seems like it would pay almost the same and be much less stressful.

[07:37:34] <TheGuestMovie> let me put it this way: time could freeze for everyone else but me for 3 years, and that's how long it would take to make the software I currently maintain , fit to say "it is done".
[07:37:36] <ananke> TheGuestMovie: for every 'task' that you complete, there are two more waiting. rinse and repeat, it never ends
[07:37:47] <ayecee> software is never done
[07:37:55] <mlu> in software dev, those constraints are at least imposed by humans, but in devops, it's half human half computers
[07:38:04] <mlu> and cdomputers don't negotiate, so you must deal with it
[07:38:24] <mlu> and wait unitl you have an emergency or someone changes up the rules (just like with software dev)

[07:40:31] <TheGuestMovie> well a company like, idk, Pinephone, what would the extent of their devops be, that make it so stressful? They dont have "live services" aimed at customers, I guess an app update check server which it's not the end of the world if it goes down for an hour.
[07:40:47] <mlu> imagine what it's like to develop code not only without version control, but sometimes without even a save button -> that's what parts of devops will be like

[11:15:10] <tm512> the [m] is a suffix added by the matrix to IRC bridge

[11:15:44] <tm512> DaleGribble[m]: the [m] is only visible on IRC, on matrix it's just gonna show your display name like in any other channel
[11:15:49] <LongJohnSilvers1> Ah - I use irssi, so that could be why
[11:15:56] <TudbuT> p1stache: is something like content="$(cat file)" considered forking or not

[11:20:26] <DaleGribble[m]> surprised 'vax' is even allowed
[11:20:33] <tm512> LongJohnSilvers1: I guess to be more accurate, matrix is the protocol, but in practice there's basically just one populated network, kinda like IRC, various servers network together
[11:20:37] <p1stache> TudbuT: I don't need to do anything on the file, just show its contents
[11:20:40] <mlu> Trillian still exists?
[11:20:50] <LongJohnSilvers1> No problem! You should try Alksaseltzer Plus if you have it - if you have a sore throat. And saline spray and claritin for stuffy noses REALLY helps too

[13:48:15] <labrador> So youre using them on a tty?
[13:48:48] <ProfessorChunk> Just saying its weird not a single vterm out there has thought about what a nice feature it would be into have a toggle to forward pageup/down mouse wheel, etc to a terminal multiplexer
[13:49:10] <mrfb> ProfessorChunk: the question is, why?
[13:49:14] <ProfessorChunk> Yes all servers run GUI's in 2021
[13:49:39] <mrfb> are you phisically on front of that server?
[13:49:40] <phogg> ProfessorChunk: uh, what?
[13:49:50] <mrfb> s/on/in
[13:49:55] <ProfessorChunk> mrfb: to make scrolling in terminal multiplexers mich easier so you dont have to enter a copy mode scroll and then exit it.
[13:50:10] <tnewman> what is the output youre trying to scroll?
[13:50:23] <phogg> ProfessorChunk: they'd probably accept patches
[13:50:24] <labrador> Wait won't the tty send the input to muxer first anyway
[13:50:37] <labrador> The muxer is your problem
[13:50:43] <mrfb> ProfessorChunk: are you phisically connected to that server?
[13:50:43] <labrador> Not the tty
[13:50:45] <tnewman> very rarely am i trying to scroll the terminal itself, i'm trying to scroll some file, in which case PgUp/PgDn are fine
[13:50:59] <tnewman> lnav, less, vim, whatever
[13:51:03] <mrfb> or are you in a ssh remote session?
[13:51:17] <phogg> tnewman: you never look at the terminal scrollback? I often do, shift+pageup is a reflex.
[13:51:37] <ProfessorChunk> say I do an apt search something and the results overfill my screen buffer.. I then have to use less/more or the stupid copy mode is all I am saying
[13:51:58] <mrfb> this is simply stupid.
[13:52:00] <labrador> The problem is in the muxers themselves though
[13:52:00] <tnewman> phogg: its rare, but if something is that many lines, its usually a file, in which case i'll employ `less` or `lnav`

[13:56:21] <ProfessorChunk> Otherwise we wouldnt need to go into an edit/copy mode to scroll in the plexer.
[13:56:31] <ProfessorChunk> I am not saying it doesnt send the keypresses.
[13:57:14] <ProfessorChunk> phogg: Of course it is, I do not think he does much server admin stuff so it may seem odd to him.

[14:04:25] <ProfessorChunk> A simple option, doesnt even have to be default, that you can enable to just treat all scrolling inputs as if they were on that terminal would be simple to implement. For the 8th time lol.

[14:30:02] <hexnewbie> The prefix is there for a reason, it makes key combinations work inside the program running inside tmux (it's bad enough that the GUi terminal already breaks a portion of those)

[14:35:38] <hexnewbie> Not so sure about that. My Konsole tabs are switched Shift+arrows, and I cannot for the life of me get used to Ctrl+PgUp/PgDown. Yet Shift+arrows is for selecting text in two editors I use. Pretty annoying (a workaround is that if I open a new Konsole window with no tabs, Shift+Arrows works in the editors until I create a tab)
[14:36:12] <hexnewbie> So it's possible they got used to the combination before realizing it's conflicting with something else they do

[15:24:18] <Danilo82> i know, but that way i can compress it into a tar, so if i ever want to play it again i'll just extract it and not have to dowload 32 bits libs again

[15:40:04] <koollman> I don't have a large enough sample to comment on that
[15:40:06] <hexnewbie> webchat37 asked for *encryption*. If Windows is required, finding an encryption layer that works in both Windows and GNU/Linux will be a tad more important than the filesystem. I can't think of any I would *recommend* (ahem, VeraCrypt, ahem)
[15:40:06] <labrador> webchat37 yes ext4 is native gnu/linux
[15:40:10] <MrElendig> also not many things reads udf
[15:40:12] <ProfessorChunk> How does windows not have a journaled FS by now?
[15:40:17] <labrador> it does

My use case is real-time streaming lots of data and I want to make optimal use of the bandwidth.
[16:11:43] <joo-_> MrElendig: I am not sure it beats any email program that runs on a computer at blazing speed, even offline.
[16:11:44] <lericson> i'm starting to believe ProfessorChunk isn't a professor at all
[16:12:03] <MrElendig> joo-_: it does, most local email clients are actually pretty trash

[20:40:27] <peetaur> the C-style loop is essential when you have math in there, not just a list of static entries, or if your list is so long it would run out of RAM allocating the list before it loops

[21:35:04] <Ooga> labrador, The best way I could understand was that : appimages are sorta like an .exe file and deb is like a zip file?
[21:35:35] <labrador> phogg, It is important for users to understand the basics of their systems
[21:36:05] <phogg> Ooga: not really. The apt system is a bit like a mashup between windows update and steam. Flatpak is like an alternative to just the steam part, and appimages are a similar idea by different people.
[21:36:10] *** Joins: AnakNakal (~esuga@180.252.89.177)
[21:36:21] <akk> On most (debian-derived) distros, understanding apt is enough, you can ignore things like flatpak and appimage.
[21:36:21] <phogg> labrador: you would be surprised how much that is not true
[21:36:39] <akk> (in ubuntu you also have to know about snap)
[21:36:45] <phogg> labrador: it's *useful* to know how it works, but if you don't want to you can go a long time without needing to know. It's not important for most people.
[21:37:08] <Ooga> Okay okay basically apt is for managing the repos and "steam" part where as flatpak is an alternative. appimages are like an executable straight from downloading.

[21:37:51] <labrador> Ooga, .debs are packages installed by your main distro package manager,flatpaks are distro-independent and therefore bundle their dependencies and also have repositories(app store),and appimages are portable exes with a one file one app concept

[21:37:56] <ozzz> I wouldn't trust third party distros. Who knows what they patched in binaries
[21:38:22] <legend> Ooga: an .ELF binary file would be the same as a exe file. An appimage is a compressed archive of an entire app (which make contain multiple binary elf files), where when you execute it, the compressed archive is mounted as an invisible drive, and the app is executed from there. TLDR: an ELF file is similar to EXE, An appimage is a compressed collection of all files need to run the app.

[21:38:34] <legend> But an both appimages and ELF files are directly executable

[21:40:31] <Ooga> Okay so I get that bit.
[21:40:40] <phogg> Ooga: so apt and flatpak are *both* package management systems, although they work considerably differently. Having multiple package managers on a system is a bit weird, but as long as they manage different things you can do it. Ubuntu chose to deliver and update the base system with apt, and then use flatpak for some applications.

[21:41:50] <Ooga> Cross platform
[21:41:54] <phogg> Ooga: apt and flatpak are both package managers that can install anything, but flatpak works in a *very* different way. It aims to create more self-contained installs, so in that sense it is like app images (but in no other)
[21:42:00] <labrador> yes, a distro independent packaging system
[21:42:02] <akk> Ooga: Right, or cross-distro anyway

[23:56:38] <Tom^> and since there is two monitors that also run at different hz its gonna end up tearing at some point?
[23:56:59] <akik> derek_shnosh: i noticed screen tearing with fedora 34, plasma 5.22.5 even though i use intel driver with TearFree on
[23:57:00] <Inline> no
[23:57:16] <MrElendig> tearfree is a misleading name
[23:57:28] <MrElendig> it can't actually get rid of all tearing
[23:57:31] <akik> MrElendig: it's an option in the driver
[23:57:34] <rascul> tearing should always be free
[23:57:44] <MrElendig> it just reduces the chance of it happening

[23:57:56] <akik> it has worked until now
[23:58:01] <Inline> tearing i had on the tv, but that's because due to nouveau use, with nvidia there's no tearing and with nouveau there's only the problem of the flickering mouse when set to HiDPi at fractional resolution 200%
[23:58:19] <Inline> with nvidia there's no problem with HiDPi at fractional resolution 200%

[23:58:30] <akik> [    17.433] (**) intel(0): Option "TearFree" "true"
[23:58:31] <akik> [    17.435] (**) intel(0): TearFree enabled
[23:58:33] <MrElendig> akik: its timing based and it can change due to basically anything happening in the system

[23:58:50] <MrElendig> also you might not always notice that you have tearing while it is actually there
[23:58:50] <cerl> Sometimes I wish fragmentation wasn't a huge issue with linux.
[23:58:51] <Inline> with nouveau i could get rid of the mouse flickering via lowering the fractional resolution one step down i.e. 175%
[23:59:14] <MrElendig> vsync/vrr can mostly get rid of the root cause
[23:59:16] <akik> MrElendig: for the current software versions for fedora 34 it's really easy to see it's not working
[23:59:39] <Inline> welp, actually the tearing i had was transitional, appeared only at some weird settings i had....
[23:59:40] <MrElendig> akik: and on the identical machine next to you you might not see any tearing
[23:59:42] <naptastic> MrElendig, do you know, if the system is configured for low latency / real-time performance, will it improve the performance of "TearFree" technology?
[23:59:44] <Ooga> Hey guys its me again.
[23:59:49] <Ooga> On a different machine.
[23:59:51] <MrElendig> naptastic: it won't
[23:59:54] <Inline> but the mouse flickering with nouveau is real
