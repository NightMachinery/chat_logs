[01:00:18] <sam_> i think you may not understand its purpose
[01:00:27] <Guest7626> Hello guys, I can't understand how the web vulnerability scanners works exactly, I've investigated some open source tools and I think that they are looking only for urls with query parameters to scan for sql injection i.e.
[01:00:37] <Guest7626> but I don't think it's correct to look only for urls with query params I think you need to parse the html forms as well and form request with their input, but the big question here is what if there is server side validation?
[01:01:32] <Klinda> what's the point to give kids bugs to exploit??
[01:01:49] <sam_> again
[01:01:52] <Klinda> they will not learn anything
[01:01:53] <sam_> shellcode is not the "exploit" bit
[01:02:08] <sam_> or it's not the vulnerability part anyway :)
[01:02:21] <Klinda> if you do it by yourself it's har dto do
[01:02:27] <ajak> and people generally don't give people things to exploit
[01:02:39] <ajak> at least not in the way you seem to be implying
[01:02:44] <sam_> shellcode is just what you use to leverage a vulnerability and you can only use it once you're already at the point where you have control over the program
[01:02:45] <Guest7626> are you talking to me guys?
[01:03:04] <ajak> no
[01:03:29] <ajak> Guest7626: it sounds like the tools you've found don't do an exhaustive search, yes
[01:03:38] <Klinda> sam_: it's like the interface beteween you and the shell ?
[01:03:39] <ajak> that's why humans need to be involved
[01:04:32] <Guest7626> ajak may you help me, because I've been researching and still I can't get it and I still can't manage to find decent information on how a web vulnerability scanner is supposed to scan exactly for some of the vulnerabilities out there
[01:04:36] <sam_> Klinda: usually it's the part which sets things up so you get a shell or you get a remote connection out. first you find a vulnerability, then you exploit it, then once you can execute what you want, you stuff in your shellcode to get more capabilities
[01:04:43] <sam_> the shellcode is just a tool
[01:05:21] <Guest7626> ajak the problem is most likely that you are supposed to create a software that is going to test against unknown system for vulnerabilities

[01:08:12] <sam_> also depends on your aim I think
[01:08:30] <ajak> generally that's what you need to exploit a binary

[01:15:18] <Guest7626> on the other hand you are able to parse the html forms from the source code and build requests based on the information from the forms and you will know where to address the http request thanks to the action and method form attributes

[01:32:08] <Platonides> there should be something you already suspect will work
[01:32:19] <Guest7626> I don't have time to do reverse engineering over open source scanners, but I did over one for a few hours and got it how it works, it was created the way I was thinking it is supposed to be created, but missing a lot of parts which came into my mind about developing one
[01:32:20] <Platonides> not too hard, so you can complete it in the needed time
[01:32:53] <Guest7626> and I've figured out how another open source tool is working and didn't like it either
[01:33:02] <Platonides> but hopefully not something so known that it can be said "this is just like X, Y and Z solutions out there" (and probably worse)

[01:42:23] <Guest7626> I can explain in the thesis the different attacks like sql injections, cross site scripting, csrf etc..

[01:44:07] <ajak> well there's a big problem, you don't have a thesis you want to do
[01:44:07] <Platonides> perhaps you could add an add-on for an existing scanner

[01:44:41] <Platonides> that way you don't duplicate work on the parts that already exist
[01:44:58] <mats1> is it as masturbatory as haskell etc
[01:45:04] <Guest7626> true, but is it a bad idea for a topic for a thesis to develop some kind of web app which is secured?

[01:50:12] <Platonides> if I was in the Jury for your "secure" web app
[01:50:22] <ajak> input sanitization probably isn't how to prevent log4j exploitation..
[01:50:22] <Platonides> I would attempt to find a vulnerability on it

[02:35:12] <Guest7626> well I am just super stressed, anxious, because I have no idea if the time will be enough for me, everything is taking too much time, even picking a programming language in which you will develop such a scanner, finding/picking libraries which will be useful to you during the development and understanding how you are supposed to do the automatic
[02:35:13] <Guest7626> scanning for the different types of vulnerabilities out there
[02:35:59] <abraham> Guest7626: seek mentorship if you have gaps in your knowledge that you can't figure out by yourself
[02:36:19] <abraham> There's likely a lot of unwritten knowledge regarding building scanners
[02:36:28] <abraham> that people out there know from experience
[02:36:49] <abraham> Look on github for developers of popular scanners and maybe start a conversation with them
[02:36:58] <abraham> build up your knowledge
[02:37:06] <Guest7626> I
[02:37:14] <Guest7626> I've been going through the code of some open source scanners
[02:37:30] <Guest7626> and I've seen them implementing my logic in there nothing new
[02:37:34] <Guest7626> I mean I did research first

[02:49:27] <Platonides> it's worth thinking on it
[02:49:41] <Platonides> as you then will have to implement it
[02:49:59] <Guest7626> I've been researching and thinking of a topic and I came up with the web vulnerability scanner, but after doing research on it I think it is way too hard and complicated for a master's thesis

[02:50:34] <abraham> Guest7626: I really don't think it is, it doesn't need to be a generally edge-cutting scanner
[02:51:08] <abraham> Guest7626: it can be a simple scanner that is edge-cutting in one use-case
[02:51:38] <Guest7626> abraham yes, but I don't think I can come up with something new that is not already implemented in the existing scanners

[02:52:51] <Guest7626> but I don't think I will be able to come up with something new
[02:52:58] <Guest7626> and even if it's missing something
[02:53:11] <Platonides> maybe someone from the community of that scanner would have ideas?
[02:53:17] <Guest7626> I don't know how I will make 80 pages out of it
[02:53:33] <Platonides> I don't think it would be that hard
[02:53:45] <Guest7626> except if it's something really big, but I don't think there is anything missing

[02:54:23] <Platonides> then the architecture

[08:34:45] <fishguts> i mean as long as juliaEnv isn't covering the entire chat with spam links i don't really see the problem. maybe they just found it in their interests to share the links
[08:35:37] <juliaEnv> yes, it is a major security event that happened in December 2021 (last month), so I wanted to share with the security community as well

[08:38:32] <juliaEnv> the thing that happened in December 2021 (last month) is the US has blacklisted several major Chinese military, medical, and research institutions due to China having a brain control technology

[09:02:39] <fishguts> your OS sits in a section of memory, so why would it be volatile and disappear when you turn your PC off

[09:08:30] <fishguts> same i'm not very knowledgeable with mobile devices. I know Android functions similar to other *NIX systems and that iPhone is pretty safe
[09:08:50] <ajak> yes, android is linux
[09:09:05] <ghostbuster> i haven't had an android device in a few years, but i have messed with bootloader code a few years ago
[09:09:27] <fishguts> i have a book on rootkits, quite informative

[10:41:09] <pabed> fishywishy: I mean in the digital signature and authentication
[10:42:17] <pabed> in digital sig , a person encrypts the hash of the data with his private key. Anyone can decrypt the same with the available public key of the person and verify the authenticity of the data.

[10:46:50] <pabed> now I want to get this rule :

[10:46:51] <pabed> all statements are true?
[10:49:15] <Disconsented> you'd need two keys for that afaik
[10:49:49] <dodo> pabed: a public key can't decrypt
[10:49:59] <dodo> that's the whole point
[10:50:46] <dodo> and crypting with a private key is kind of.. no-no. you can derive a pubkey from a privkey though, so that option doesn't make too much sense to me

[10:58:43] <pabed>  
[10:58:43] <pabed> if you can decrypt  ciphertext by the public key of signer and get to  origin text means the signer who claim signed by his private key associated by his public key

[20:34:50] <ADHD> What does it mean when they say "that hardware/system only runs signed code"? I know when a software comes in standalone binary, it can include a ".asc" file that holds the signed hash of hat bianry and we use "gpg --verify" to see if it's from a verified developer. But I'm not sure what the former mean.
[20:37:10] <ys> for example iOS runs only apps signed by Apple. So it is up to the OS to make sure that it can run only signed apps. We cannot say the same about the regular Linux because you can run even non signed code there.
[20:37:20] *** Joins: agonhajdari (~textual@user/agonhajdari)
[20:38:31] <ADHD> ys: But what does it mean when we say it's signed? Like, that sign checking is an optional check that people do to see if that binary is indeed comes from that said developer/corp. But they could skip that `gpg --verify` step totally and just execute that binary right?
[20:39:21] <ADHD> ys: Are you saying that "installation" step *itself* internally does `gpg --verify` like step and checks for the signacture from Apple?
[20:39:46] <Platonides> ADHD: yes
[20:39:56] *** Quits: spare (~4tuazk2h3@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:39:57] <Platonides> installing an app on iOS does that
[20:39:58] <ADHD> I see, so it all depends on that "wrapper"
[20:40:07] <ADHD> that "wrapper" step does that checks.
[20:40:20] <ys> iOS forces to check the valid sign of the code you install on iOS.
[20:40:28] <Platonides> they have /something/ checking that
[20:40:29] <ADHD> And, the users are restricted to install things only via that "wrapper".
[20:40:34] *** Quits: martums (~martums@user/martums) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:40:45] <Platonides> they are restricted to only install apps from Apple Store, yes
[20:41:06] <Platonides> they need to jailbreak to install from other sources
[20:41:49] <Platonides> (*) someone with an Apple developer certificate ($$$) can install their own apps on the device they have registered as their own
[20:41:50] <ys> So implication "only runs signed" means that there is a restriction somewhere in the system that rejects everything that is non signed. The way the sign is verified - there may be many ways.
[20:42:18] <Platonides> yes
[20:42:36] <ADHD> Platonides: No, I mean, let's assume iOS includes a program called "app_installer" which takes an application (ex: iOS app from App store) and installes it on the system. So, we feed that iOS (.app file for example) to "app_installer" and it checks the signacture of that .app file and verifies if it's indeed from apple, and only then it installes it on the system. right?
[20:43:06] <ys> Correct
[20:43:50] <ADHD> I see, so the users are restricted to only using that "app_installer" built-in program to install new apps on iOS system. Which means they *must* go through that step of sign checking?
[20:44:27] <Platonides> yes
[20:44:28] <ys> That is what iOS does. And jailbreaking removes
[20:44:34] <ADHD> Yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, a "wrapper" is needed.
[20:45:05] <Platonides> jailbreaking gives you back control of your device, allowing you to bypass that check
[20:45:15] <ADHD> ah, i see.
[20:45:20] <ys> But it involves certificates, public keys, so noone except Apple can actually sign the App
[20:45:27] <Platonides> exactly
[20:45:31] <ADHD> yeah.
[20:45:36] <Platonides> whereas in Android
[20:45:42] <ADHD> interesting stuff.
[20:45:45] <Platonides> by default you can only install from the App store
[20:45:58] <Platonides> but there is a setting which allows you to install from other places as well
