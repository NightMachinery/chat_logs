[18:40:03] <Bayes> Im thinking of start using org-roam, so I thought I'd just pass by and say hi

[19:14:28] <konubinix> hi
[19:21:10] <Bayes> :)
[19:21:47] <Bayes> kinda vague question but I'm wondering, does anyone here use org-roam to keep track of heavily mathematical concepts and definitions?
[19:22:21] <Bayes> I totally see how to use org-roam for lit notes, and for notes involving concepts that can be written in English
[19:22:46] <Bayes> I'm still wondering if it's a good idea to try and throw in some math concepts as well, or whether I just keep a separate latex file for that

[21:46:02] <sm2n> you can totally do it
[21:46:16] <sm2n> writing math in org can be pretty ergonomic with the right setup
[21:46:19] <sm2n> preview and stuff
[21:47:21] <sm2n> it really depends on what you want
[21:48:04] <sm2n> math is often laid out as a theorem/proof narrative of sorts, which doesn't read well with hyperlinking and transclusion
[21:48:23] <sm2n> but if you keep more self-contained stuff it can work
[21:49:08] <sm2n> Bayes:
[21:50:22] <Bayes> sm2n okay that's good to know, it might work best for self-contained stuff
[21:50:50] <Bayes> what do you mean the right setup?
[21:51:26] <Bayes> I mean I use emacs a lot to type latex so I'm also interested about making the most of my setup
[22:14:39] <sm2n> preview-latex in org mainly
[22:14:56] <sm2n> you can enter math mode in org directly, and it works
[22:15:05] <sm2n> and then render it in buffer
[22:15:13] <sm2n> works like the preview in auctex buffers
[22:19:53] <Bayes> oh ok I'm gonna take a look at that, thanks sm2n
