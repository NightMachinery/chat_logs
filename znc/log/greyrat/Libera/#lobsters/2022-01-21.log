[00:21:51] <vgel> fun csv hack: need to type sentences in a csv? use ¸ (cedilla) instead of a normal comma¸ like that! who needs escaping?
[00:23:30] <pe> It looks horrible.
[00:24:07] <iDrougge> CSV was made by a deranged mind.
[00:24:15] <epilys> looks like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_subscript

[00:24:41] <iDrougge> Why do we always standardise on someone's proof of concept?
[00:24:53] <epilys> ͺ
[00:26:04] <iDrougge> Last year, I worked on a program that generated surveys based on CSV files from Excel sheets made by a pair of scientists.
[00:26:25] <iDrougge> I had to use typographical quotes to handle escaping of quote marks.
[00:27:09] <iDrougge> But at least typographical quote marks are typograhically correct, unlike cedillas.
[00:27:23] <cb> use! the! ascii! record! separators!
[00:27:39] <iDrougge> Yes please.
[00:27:46] <iDrougge> Or, lacking that, use TSV.
[00:28:22] <JordiGH> "e.g. it could be that up to 5% positive increase gets approved and up to a 10% negative increase gets approved"
[00:28:37] <JordiGH> "negative increase", do we have another name for that? hmmmmmm.....
[00:29:00] <JordiGH> At least it's technically correct.
[00:29:15] <JordiGH> I should reply with "oh, you mean a 5% negative decrease?"
[00:31:57] <albertito> don't you mean a -10% positive increase? :P

[00:33:46] <epilys> :)
[00:36:43] <banna> One fun thing I fought with for moments longer than I ever wanted to was having a json structure storing strings of... more json strings.
[00:36:55] <banna> Terrible.
[00:39:31] <jmiven> sounds like a great way to lose an hour or two :)
[00:41:40] <poqomchi> you'd love the MSFT PlayReady headers I deal with at work... it's an XML document, stored as UTF-16, Base64-encoded, placed into an MP4 box, which is then Base-64 encoded and placed into an XML document
[00:45:42] <iDrougge> I had a colleague at my former job (as mentioned before) embed escaped JSON into JSON. Engineering as usual.
[00:46:13] <iDrougge> At my current job, we have a prototype service that has a base64 encoded JSON structure in a HTTP header.
[00:47:42] <banna> poqomchi: I'm... at a loss of words.
[00:52:23] <imode> poqomchi: ...MP4?... _MPEG-4_?!
[00:52:41] <imode> oh god.

[00:54:21] <imode> wha
[00:54:53] <imode> wait can you elaborate on that for a sec.
[00:55:05] <pe> It's just a container with commercially available standards.
[00:55:08] <imode> oh!
[00:55:30] <imode> I thought you were saying that the standard somehow enforced double-base64 encoding lmao.
[00:55:32] <pe> And you can't parse it well without knowing what you're looking for...
[00:55:49] <pe> No, you can put binary whatever in there.
[00:56:41] <poqomchi> yeah... the top level XML doc is a DASH MPD (streaming manifest format)
[00:57:02] <poqomchi> the MPD contains a Base64-encoded copy of the PSSH MP4 box

[00:58:42] <poqomchi> also I think I mis-remembered: the contents of the PSSH aren't base64 encoded, but the UTF-16 XML doc can contain arbitrary custom elements, so of course we stuck a base64-encoded blob in it

[03:55:18] <rtpg> I believe require is a thing that nodeJS came up with way back, import is the "official ECMAscript way", and basically every library in the world has the right wrappers to handle both (or expect you to use webpack to handle all of it correctly)
[03:55:38] <JordiGH> btw wtf is webpack
[03:55:56] <JordiGH> I thought it was supposed to grab all of your js and jam it into a single file 'cause that's good fro the web browser or something.

[03:56:59] <rtpg> Right, it's essentially an asset compiler? It lets you build your assets nicely, but it also provides hooks for things like "take my typescript and turn it into JS" or "use import on a jpg, and turn that into the URL for the static asset"
[03:57:56] <rtpg> so if you're using webpack you can do things like 'import (* as level_data) from "./level_data.json"' and have that just work "as expected"

[04:08:28] <vgel> JordiGH that's what webpack started out as I think, but now it's more of a general-source-processor that has a huge plugin ecosystem and does all sorts of transforms on your code (for example, with certain plugins you can `import bg from "background.png"` which, rather than including that in your source code, is a directive to copy that image into
[04:08:28] <vgel> the static files folder and assign `bg` to the URL of that image on the development or production server. yeah, it's about as hard to debug when it fails as it sounds...)
[04:09:47] <JordiGH> Big interview tomorrow, kind of scared. My interviewers have big CVs.
[04:10:30] <vgel> good luck! honestly if they ask you questions about webpack they're sadists, nobody understands how that shit works lol

[08:58:53] <rtpg> Threading is much more of a thing nowadays, but I believe that twitter as "place to tell a lot of people life updates" does work very well! And then you use alternative communication styles for other stuff. I wouldn't want to be on a ML which has everyone posting a bunch of details about their life every 10 minutes, but the twitter feed is nice because you can look at it, and then look away
[08:59:46] <rtpg> I mean it's not a conversation in the same way that sending a new year's card isn't a conversation either I suppose. Or writing a blog post I guess. "Microblogging" is a good explanation!
[08:59:56] <pe> It definitely works great as news feeds for companies.

[09:01:46] <pe> No real way to order it, filter it.
[09:02:03] <CHUD> what? do you even have twitter? you can order and filter
[09:02:23] <pe> You mean different things by it.
[09:02:32] <pe> I mean use it like an actual database.
[09:02:49] <pe> And give it a regexp.
[09:03:05] <pe> Or anything.

[09:03:52] <rtpg> yeah the search does suck and it would be nice if like... the feed were just stored on your machine locally if you wanted to (like e-mail). I'm sure you could set up some mastadon client to do something like that if you wanted to
[09:04:07] <rtpg> would be lying if I didn't have times where I was like "I saw this thing and I can't for the life of me find it again"

[18:09:35] <rb> fair
[18:10:37] <riv> the thing i find is with ode that hasn't been done this way

[18:11:22] <pushcx> atw: Yeah, definitely not a rant. I removed the tag. Thanks for pointing it out. FWIW there's also a 'suggest' link under the story title to fix it
[18:11:23] <riv> mostly its when people tried to line a bunch of things up vertically for readability
[18:11:46] <riv> it may look nice but I don't think it's worth it for not being able to autoindent the file
[18:13:07] <gwozniak> There are many parts of GCC that would be horrific if autoindented
[18:13:34] <gwozniak> Although I don't know if the .def files should count
[18:15:09] <atw> morning pushcx, hope you're well :) is there a karma threshhold for suggest?

[22:50:29] <companion_cube> ahah for sure.
[22:50:30] <bkhl> I have a bit of a pet peeve about that when it comes to "representation".
[22:50:32] <bparker> >are non native english speakers prejudiced against <- depends on what color you are /s
[22:51:17] <bkhl> Like when Hollywood movies are described as having improved representation because they hire some actor from Japan or something where they are in the highest echelon of society.
[22:51:19] <companion_cube> but then it's racism, not language, is it? :)

[22:51:53] <bparker> companion_cube: what about americans that hate people who can't speak English? (and then tell them to "go back where you came from")
[22:52:03] <kline> was there not some record of jews in the netherlands that were kept for ostensibly innocent reasons but were seized and abused during world war 2?
[22:52:29] <companion_cube> bparker: oh, do they hate themselves? they tend to have terrible grammar
[22:52:36] <bkhl> bparker, well that's relevant to people that _are in the US_.
[22:52:53] <kline> remember: not just do you have to ensure that the data you store is stored safely and ethically now, but you have to ensure those records are stored safely and ethically under all possible future management/regimes
[22:53:14] <bparker> bkhl: isn't? I don't think other countries are as quick to straight up "hate" people who can't already speak their language perfectly
[22:53:19] <kline> if you wouldnt want it leaked to criminals or a malicious govt, you shouldnt be storing it
[22:53:26] <bparker> is it?*
[22:53:39] <companion_cube> kline: but being a native speaker is really not that important of a datum, I think.
[22:53:40] *** Joins: tafa (~tafa@user/tafa)
[22:53:43] <bkhl> bparker, I think it's the other way around, English speakers are unusually tolerant to people with an accent.
[22:53:59] <bparker> bkhl: are you american?
[22:54:06] <bkhl> I'm sure there's a gradient but here in Sweden there is a _much_ higher expectation of people to adopt perfect grammar and pronunciation.
[22:54:18] <bparker> because I don't think many would agree with that statement
[22:54:33] <vladimyr> And that any data point can and will be used for discrimination because people tend to always find new ways how to screw things up
[22:54:48] <bkhl> Actually it's a common observation that English is rather tolerant to variation in pronunciation and grammer.
[22:55:02] <bkhl> Probably partially due to it having a lot of different standards, not a single one.
[22:55:04] <companion_cube> not that they have a choice
[22:55:05] <kline> companion_cube, its an excellent way to select for non-anglos in your Newmerican ethnostate
[22:55:11] <bparker> I think americans tend to discriminate more based on *having* a different accent than they do, not even as much as having bad grammar/pronunciation, but that's also a thing too
[22:55:18] <companion_cube> kline: I open my mouth, this piece of data is out in the open
[22:55:24] <companion_cube> it's really not a secret :D
[22:55:39] <ngoldbaum> not in here though
[22:55:52] <ngoldbaum> in here you’re just a friendly cube covered in hearts who likes rust
[22:55:56] <bkhl> bparker, well, there is on the other hand entire standard dialects of English with different sets of vowels &c.
[22:56:00] <companion_cube> heh, fair enough :D
[22:56:02] <kline> "secrecy" isnt binary, theres a difference between people you speak to being able to identify it, and it being tracked in a database for trivial querying
[22:56:04] <bparker> like people from north US might really hate the southern accent or vice versa
[22:56:14] <edk> i think accent-based discrimination does happen just because it carries information about nationality/race
[22:56:24] <edk> but it's very context-dependent
[22:56:28] <bkhl> Compared to here in Sweden if you can't get the correct pronuncation of "u" (almost impossible if not native), you're forever marked as speaking "broken" Swedish.
[22:56:34] <companion_cube> kline: like, the immigration database? :D
[22:56:49] <kline> companion_cube, do you think the immigration database is without risks?
[22:56:54] <bkhl> Same with rather small details that don't affect understanding much in Swedish such as genus of nouns and the tones.
[22:57:02] <edk> in contexts where people weren't going to be racist anyway i don't think they discriminate against accents specifically
[22:57:05] <edk> at least here
[22:57:10] <companion_cube> lol no, but I'm already in there, with fignerprints and all
[22:57:14] <companion_cube> (yikes)
[22:57:16] <bparker> bkhl: as if Swedish people's English pronunication is that perfect /s
[22:57:17] <kline> companion_cube, then why expand those risks?
[22:57:36] <bkhl> bparker, that has very little to do do with accepting people into Swedish society.

[22:58:05] <bparker> bkhl: so you can be more accepted by simply *not* speaking Swedish?
[22:58:16] <bkhl> Kind of, if you speak English that is.
[22:58:22] <kline> companion_cube, adding more datapoints is strictly _at least_ as hazardous, and being exactly no-more-hazardous is definitely the less common case
[22:58:26] <bkhl> A lot of professional people moving here don't bother speaking it.

[22:58:58] <bkhl> Which is understandable, you get treated a lot better just speaking fluent English, rather than trying "broken" Swedish.
[22:59:06] <ngoldbaum> if i tried speaking broken swedish to you as a tourist would you almost certainly try english instead?
[22:59:16] <ngoldbaum> seems to be the norm in a lot of northern europe
[22:59:18] <bparker> I don't speak Swedish but if I was visiting, I wouldn't bother trying to learn any Swedish or anything like that
[22:59:31] <bparker> I don't think it would be necessary
[22:59:36] <bkhl> bparker, well, we were talking about marginalized groups here.
[22:59:39] <edk> ime any scandinavian who realises you speak english will immediately start speaking english to you
[22:59:41] <bkhl> That might be discriminated.
[22:59:48] <bparker> sure
[23:00:02] <bkhl> bparker, if you tried to move to Sweden and work menial jobs etc., you would not get away with only speaking English.
[23:00:05] <edk> but i was gonna say, i think the refugees do all learn swedish
[23:00:10] <bkhl> Whereas if you move here and become a surgeon or something, you'd be fine.
[23:00:19] <bparker> yea I get that

[23:02:34] <edk> well singapore exists

[23:02:59] <bkhl> edk, also India …
[23:03:09] <bkhl> Singapore doesn't go far as far as "large numbers" of people go.
[23:03:24] <bparker> but English is a de facto language there
[23:03:33] <bparker> south korea also has a huge English speaking population
[23:03:36] <ngoldbaum> in beijing i’d often run into people who wanted to practice english with me
[23:03:42] <edk> india has english as an official language but not a widely spoken one
[23:03:43] <ngoldbaum> but definitely the minority
[23:03:46] <bkhl> Actually my experience there (Singapore) was that the English knowledge is quite mixed.
[23:03:50] <technomancy> I read the other day that Singapore used to have phone numbers you could call to get free English and Mandarin lessons
[23:04:05] <bparker> the government officially accepts English but not everyone speaks it
[23:04:06] <technomancy> as part of their "Speak Good English" and "Speak Mandarin" campaigns
[23:04:09] <edk> singapore's rates of english are much higher
[23:04:35] <vladimyr> Hong Kong?
[23:04:40] <bparker> cantonese.
[23:04:47] <bkhl> Sure, though I'm not sure it is much different from some of comparable megacities in India.
[23:04:50] <wink> HK seemed hit or miss to me
[23:05:04] <wink> if English at all, at least passable. but often zero English
[23:05:17] <bkhl> Hong Kong and Singapore also have their own dialects of English that are quite hard to understand.
[23:05:18] <technomancy> singapore has a lot of problems but I kind of miss living in a country where the government is willing to spend a lot of money to solve the problems of its citizens
[23:05:28] <bkhl> So if you run into some people that use those you might mistake them for non-native.
[23:05:36] <bparker> also philippines and malaysia have lots of English speakers
[23:06:09] <bkhl> Malaysian English is one of my favourite dialects.

[23:12:21] <bparker> or if you're with someone who looks Japanese, even if you (as a foreigner) are speaking to them in Japanese, they will look at and reply to the Japanese-looking person instead
