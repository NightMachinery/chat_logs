[02:28:15] <surmishUrmishSha> So I was able to get a good build by using USE_BUNDLED=OFF, I had previously installed dependencies locally. One of the problems with using bundled packages is that they're downloaded during the build from some sites which were behind a firewall. I tried editing those urls and hosting files myself but that was too much work due to sub-dependencies. 
[02:28:44] <surmishUrmishSha> the final nvim file size was around 4.6M which is a huge improvement over the one provided in nightly appimage
[02:29:08] <surmishUrmishSha> Thanks

[18:54:23] <d1rewolf> but yeah, I can install a package manager and use that. But I'd really like to understand how packages work, and it seems like installing one manually would be a good path to this

[19:12:48] <d1rewolf> what is the most robust GUI client for macOS users out of curiosity?
[19:13:03] <d1rewolf> vimr?
[19:13:33] <clason[m]> depends on how native, and whether you want to follow HEAD
[19:14:39] <numToStr[m]> neovide seems nice https://github.com/neovide/neovide

[19:15:17] <zenof> hey, I tried the dark+ colorscheme (from https://github.com/dunstontc/vim-vscode-theme/blob/master/colors/dark_plus.vim ) , but with this colorscheme my line numbering becomes invisible (foreground same as background color) , and so do comments. And I am not quite familiar with how color schemes work...
[19:15:39] <clason[m]> doesn't have any native integration, though (shortcuts, clipboard, "open with")
[19:15:49] <clason[m]> but it uses the system neovim, so that's a big plus
[19:17:00] <d1rewolf> clason[m]: are you talking about nevoide or vim?
[19:17:04] <d1rewolf> vimr? 
[19:17:12] <clason[m]> neovide
[19:17:17] <clason[m]> vimr is the exact opposite
[19:17:25] <clason[m]> why not try both; see which one you like better?
[19:17:31] <clason[m]> it's not like they cost money...

[22:11:20] <levouhAugustMasq> i had this problem before and it ended up being `git` calls for my statusline
[22:11:26] <segeljaktsegelja> aha
[22:11:39] <segeljaktsegelja> makes sense... I think it was something related to gitgutter
[22:11:55] <levouhAugustMasq> there's no equivalent to `extmark`s but for windows, right? for example, rendering a scrollbar. this works for the most part, however if you have two windows both showing the same buffer, it is impossible to update the `extmark` values properly as they are tied to the buffer, not the window.
[22:11:55] <levouhAugustMasq> the best alternative seems like it'd be something like using floating windows, but that becomes a pain to manage pretty quickly.
[22:11:55] <levouhAugustMasq> perhaps a floating window on the RHS of a window, and setting extmarks within that "scrollbar buffer" itself? any better ideas?
[22:12:36] <clason[m]> there are scrollbar plugins out there

[22:16:12] <levouhAugustMasq> how would you track resizes of windows and their associated scrollbars? just hooking into things like `WinEnter` to redraw? i have never messed with UI events but would that be something worth looking at?
