[04:08:02] <Belamos> hi
[04:08:22] <Belamos> could a native English speaker please look over a sentence and tell me their opinion?
[04:09:07] <MetaNova> as soon as you provide one, sure
[04:09:52] <Belamos> This operating agreement is entered into on 23rd of November, 2021, by and between ... LLC (hereinafter referred to as the “LLC” and/or “The Company”) and Mr. .... hereinafter known as the “Sole Member” executing this Agreement as the sole member of the Company and hereby states as follows:
[04:10:04] *** Parts: xx (~xx@user/xx) ()
[04:10:13] <Belamos> I am unsure about a couple of things:
[04:10:21] <Belamos> 1) by and between
[04:10:38] <Belamos> 2) "hereinafter known as"  vs. "hereinafter referred to as"
[04:10:48] <Belamos> 3) executing this Agreement  <=== is this correct??
[04:10:58] <Belamos> 4) and hereby states as follows <=== is this correct?
[04:11:33] <MetaNova> 1) this agreement is entered into by The Company and Mr. ..., and is between The Company and Mr. ...
[04:12:31] <MetaNova> 2) I don't see a difference, but it's legalese, so there may be a distinction. IANAL, try searching for those and what/if they mean different things
[04:12:43] <MetaNova> 3) "executing" as in "carrying out" so yes
[04:13:05] <MetaNova> 4) yes, but again, it's legalese so while valid/understood it's not regular phrasing
[04:13:28] <Belamos> I was thinking about: "and hereby deploys and says"
[04:13:31] <Belamos> #4
[04:13:51] <Belamos> the problem is, the organizer gave me a template which does not make me fully happy
[04:13:59] <MetaNova> 4) This operating agreement [..] states as follows:
[04:14:00] <Belamos> so I am re-phrasing some things, but I am not a native speaker
[04:14:38] <Belamos> Please help me with 1) - you removed the date?
[04:14:52] <MetaNova> Belamos: the sentence is constructed in a way as to be intentionally verbose, and a single sentence
[04:15:15] <Belamos> MetaNova, maybe I should clarify
[04:15:23] <Belamos> at first, there is the sentence: 
[04:15:30] <Belamos> This operating agreement is entered into on 23rd of November, 2021, by and between
[04:15:37] <Belamos> then there are 3 line breaks
[04:15:38] *** Quits: Tobbi__ (~Tobbi@2a02:8108:1240:48ec:91ed:5100:5834:6b0b) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:15:44] <Belamos> then - over multiple lines - all the details of the LLC
[04:15:50] <Belamos> followed be the word "and"
[04:15:57] <Belamos> and then again multiple lines of the sole member
[04:16:17] <Belamos> that is why the date comes first in the sentence, because I did not know how to put it at the end
[04:16:17] <MetaNova> I have seen legal print and the newlines are something that adhere to to better reference key data points, or perhaps it's just arcane carry-over
[04:16:31] <MetaNova> again IANAL so I can't really speak about why/how their print formatting is how it is
[04:16:46] <Belamos> I see
[04:16:48] <Belamos> thank you MetaNova 
[04:17:01] <MetaNova> if .. you are worrying that you are mis-representing the intended order
[04:17:45] <MetaNova> then I'd suggest looking up transcriptions of other legal documents, and comparing them, and see if the organization of the data in the transcript matches the actual document compared to yours, and adjust as necessary?
[04:18:10] <Belamos> will do so.   (and already have done so)
[04:18:16] <MetaNova> ah, okay
[04:18:23] <Belamos> MetaNova, off-topic question, but...
[04:18:32] <MetaNova> what's up?
[04:18:41] <Belamos> whoever came up with the term "IANAL" - did they intentionally make this abbreviation funny?
[04:18:47] <Belamos> or is this just "normal" ?
[04:18:59] <Belamos> when I first read this, I wondered a lot what it meant (before googling it)
[04:19:15] <MetaNova> I think it's accidentally/coincidentally amusing as it contains a sexually-suggestive term
[04:19:38] <Belamos> could you use this term in spoken English?
[04:19:59] <Belamos> and if yes, how would you pronounce it?  The way "I ANAL" or would you spell out the letters?
[04:20:17] <MetaNova> I would not advice to pronounce each letter as one might do for "ell oh ell" (lol)
[04:20:27] <MetaNova> I Am Not A Lawyer should be spoken in full
[04:20:40] <Belamos> great.  Thank you so much for this nice chat!
[04:20:49] <MetaNova> you're welcome :)

[06:16:42] <smt> this can be read and understood as "In witness of... the parties having executed this Agreement..." and yes, that's how you'd be expected to write the date
[06:17:38] <Belamos> smt, what witness, though?
[06:17:42] <Belamos> I am totally confused by this line
[06:17:57] <Belamos> in witness of what exactly is it that we are witnessing?
[06:18:10] <Belamos> this is the very bottom line of an LLC operating agreement
[06:18:15] <Belamos> just above the signature fields
[06:23:03] <Belamos> I just translated this to 2 other languages that I speak, and it does not make sense either.
[06:23:24] <smt> Sometimes, when signing documents such as this, the context of that sort of (lawyerly) language can be lost without the actual phyiscal company of other signes

[06:25:06] <Belamos> I think I've just found a good page about it:

[06:26:05] <Belamos> so, basically this expression is just saying "yes, this is what I want to sign" ?
[06:26:37] <Belamos> now we're getting closer... that came from latin.
[06:26:42] <Belamos> >> In ancient Latin deeds, they used “in cujus rei testimonium” as a concluding statement in their legal documents.
[06:26:50] <smt> yes that page articulates the meaning clearly. and yes, that's basically it. we're witnessing the signing of the preceeding agreement. 
[06:27:01] <Belamos> stupid question:
[06:27:12] <Belamos> will the notary public sign this (as he witnessed it) or will I sign this?
[06:27:28] <Belamos> I will sign this document outside the U.S.,  so I cannot ask the notary public
[06:27:49] <smt> without having seen the document I couldn't say, that's probably more of an HR / legal question :p

[06:39:25] <berndj> Belamos, I'm concerned that such a search query would retrieve primarily Hispanic porn :)
[06:40:21] <smt> In Latin, a preposition meaning with, or a conjunction meaning when, because, or although - 2. From the Latin for "with", a term in many place names in England, e.g. Prestwich-cum-Oldham
[06:40:49] <smt> only time I've ever heard it used is in this context https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magna-cum-laude.asp

[18:16:21] <zaeph> Here, I think it's a moral remove.
[18:16:43] <pussipupu> Probably social distance in this case, lack of immediacy/intimacy in interraction
[18:17:32] <NccT> here is the pragraph
[18:17:35] <NccT> Of the many habits and institutions on which covid-19 has shone a harsh light, none has been more exposed and disrupted than work. The pandemic has drawn attention to the disjuncture between the indispensability of certain jobs, from nursing to making deliveries, and how little they tend to pay. It left many workers bewilderingly idle, or stuck at a disorienting remove from their colleagues. Having downed their usual tools, the bored often took up Neolithic 
[18:17:35] <NccT> habits, like growing food or baking bread—ironically, given that it was the turn to agriculture, beginning some 12,000 years ago, which first set humankind on the path towards arduous work in dense cities, through which zoonotic diseases might one day run rampant.

[23:50:41] <Guest89> "It was first shown at the 1980 Geneva Motor Show on 3 March. Production continued through 1991."
[23:50:47] <Guest89> It is from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_Quattro , is that a valid use of "through"? As in, "through" can mean "until"?
[23:51:42] <mdogg> COrrect.
[23:52:24] <mdogg> https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/through
[23:53:22] <mdogg> 'Continuing in time toward completion of (a process or period)'
[23:54:27] <Guest89> The examples listed there are typical, and unlike that sentence imo
[23:55:32] <Guest89> In none of those examples could I replace "through" with "until"
[23:56:20] <mdogg> Well, there is a slight difference.  "Production continued until 1991." means that it stopped at the end of 1990.  "Production continued through 1991." means that it continued through that year until 1992.
[23:56:26] <mdogg> And not during 1992.
[23:56:26] <el> functionally, through is a fuzzier version of until. "until 1991" implies a stricter boundary.
[23:56:36] <el> what mdogg said
[23:57:03] <el> although it also implies that the boundary might be halfway through 1991
[23:57:37] <Guest89> okay thx
[23:57:43] <mdogg> ^ correct.  It's just letting you know that in 1991 there was a point when production stopped.
[23:57:51] <mdogg> There may be more specifics later in the article...
