[04:23:56] <MasterOfDisaster> But then the repo handling scripts piss me off more.
[04:24:54] <ectospasm> A lot of the problems I've seen is the AUR package hasn't been updated with the latest sums, so when you download files directly from upstream they don't check out.

[04:57:35] <Namarrgon> cache_return: it depends on your emulator, some support it other rely on an IME
[04:57:45] <cache_return> alacritty
[04:58:17] <Namarrgon> i guess you could use compose
[04:58:25] <ectospasm> MasterOfDisaster: that is not my decision to make.  I do try to keep my skills sharp there, though.
[04:58:35] <cache_return> but I will open a new emulator if I need to
[04:58:36] <pushqrdx> Is there any arch iso that's less than 100mb. I am used to install debian mini (which is 80mb) and simple xserver on top and it's super small even after adding all the necesseary stuff. I was surprised that arch base is 800mb and even downloaded extra 500mb
[04:58:43] <ectospasm> Many of our customers are still scared shitless of open source.
[04:58:49] <Namarrgon> pushqrdx: no, there's only one iso
[04:59:06] <Namarrgon> arch is full of bloat, just give into it
[04:59:06] <Disconsented> scared ?
[04:59:07] <Jiogen> you can create yourown custom archiso
[04:59:21] <MasterOfDisaster> ectospasm: I wouldn't move away from it - just from RHEL to the free ones.
[04:59:22] <Jiogen> https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archiso/
[04:59:24] <phrik> Title: Arch Linux - archiso 58-1 (any) (at archlinux.org)
[05:00:11] <coruja> pushqrdx: arch packages usually are bigger than debian's ones, as they ship sources, which are 'outsourced' in debian, and the arch iso offers quite a minimal approach to install
[05:00:13] <ectospasm> MasterOfDisaster: again, not my decision to make.  I don't get a choice to use many of the technologies at work.
[05:00:31] <ectospasm> I know there are better ways to do things, but I gotta work with what we have.
[05:00:37] <MasterOfDisaster> ectospasm: The powers that be over here want something they can throw money at if push comes to shove. 
[05:00:38] <Jiogen> I hate how stuck on MS we are at work
[05:00:55] <Namarrgon> coruja: arch packages do not contain sources
[05:01:00] <ectospasm> MasterOfDisaster: that's precisely the issue, even though what I do is manage a black box application.
[05:01:05] <Namarrgon> they do contain all the headers, docs, etc though
[05:01:21] <coruja> Namarrgon: i thought they did
[05:01:26] <cache_return> Namarrgon: What is compose?
[05:01:39] <coruja> ah, then not precise by me, sorry
[05:01:45] <Namarrgon> cache_return: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Configuring_compose_key
[05:01:47] <phrik> Title: Xorg/Keyboard configuration - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[05:01:48] <MasterOfDisaster> ectospasm: yeah sure, I don't want not advocate or preach - sorry if that turned out wrong.
[05:02:21] <Namarrgon> cache_return: if that's not dynamic enough then look at an IME

[10:41:47] <Synthead> the simulate option seems to iterate over the videos

[10:42:33] <thurstylark> so -sJ and then parse with jq is your turnkey

[10:43:52] <Synthead> this seems to be pretty quiet
[10:43:56] <Synthead> strace does show that it's at work

[10:44:39] <Synthead> I am trying it with --verbose
[10:45:14] <thurstylark> then put all the videos in an unlisted playlist and give the playlist link to yt-dlp
[10:45:23] <Synthead> bleh
[10:46:10] <thurstylark> actually, you could try giving it the playlist link for the channel
[10:46:22] <thurstylark> this is for the formula 1 channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QknKQ0MmpM&list=UUB_qr75-ydFVKSF9Dmo6izg&index=2
[10:46:32] <Synthead> if I give it a channel link, it works, but it iterates over what is ~800 videos
[10:46:53] <Synthead> I have a list of video IDs that I've acquired information for somewhere else
[10:47:25] <Synthead> I'm hoping to use this tool to fetch information about a channel to compare things and see if there's new content

[10:48:08] <thurstylark> the play all button here
[10:50:00] <Synthead> the playlist still iterates
[10:50:59] <thurstylark> ok, so go into more detail about what you expect it to do vs what it's doing, because I'm not understanding what metrics you're using to identify the failure case
[10:51:42] <Synthead> I'm looking to get a list of videos, even links are fine
[10:52:04] <Synthead> if I do --verbose --dump-single-json on a playlist, it will iterate over every video and do parsing
[10:52:20] <Synthead> it seems to take a few seconds each, and at that point, it already has all the video IDs and such
[10:56:08] <thurstylark> can you give me the full command that you're using?

[12:17:08] <elzar> Hi. I have a system with Ubuntu installed and I'd like to install ArchLinux with dual boot. My current plan is to use chain-loading so I can select to either boot ArchLinux, or run Ubuntu's Grub. Is this possible by installing ArchLinux with systemd-boot only, or do I need a boot loader like Grub on ArchLinux?

[12:20:52] *** Quits: kib (~kib@user/kib) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[12:22:12] <lambda> chain loading should work fine then, just install systemd-boot as normal, make sure ubuntu's grub is still the default boot entry and then add the systemd-boot binary to the grub config (or maybe grub can discover it automatically, no idea)

[15:20:01] <susi> I have had no problems with Asus laptops :-)
[15:20:18] <amaurea> susi: what wireless card do they have?
[15:21:31] <susi> aaro: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377
[15:21:33] <susi> on this one
[15:21:58] <amaurea> ok, sounds promising
[15:22:49] <susi> but I've had multiple Asuses, no problems with any of them
[15:23:22] <amaurea> I've avoided many laptops because they come with two graphics cards, one fast and high-power, and one slow and battery-saving, and managing these looked painful in linux (optimus etc.). What's the situation there? Do the asus laptops have this issue, and is it even an issue any more?

[16:47:23] <Sir_Andrei> Yea, exactly that.
[16:47:26] <Scimmia> not worth it. At all

[16:47:34] <Sir_Andrei> Not worth it?, okay.
[16:47:59] <Sir_Andrei> So let's get rid of it.
[16:48:03] <Sir_Andrei> Thx.

[16:52:56] <Edu4rdSHL> I have found an issue with the latest xkeyboard-config package (2.34), in summary: it prints ‹ › instead of < > when using the latam layout in a 105 keys keyboard. Should I report the issue to the upstream package only or to the ARch package too?

[18:24:36] <hseg> Hi, trying to set up hibernation for my laptop, am considering using swap file. Am I reading the wiki correctly that there is no declarative/automated way of creating one?
[18:24:59] <hseg> zram-generator seems to create zram devices only, which are memory-backed, hence not what I need
[18:25:16] <hseg> and systemd-swap is deprecated

[18:26:12] <hseg> so it seems I need to manually dd;chmod;mkswap;swapon to create the necessary file for hibernation
[18:26:39] <thrice> are you limited in hd space?
[18:26:47] <hseg> a little atm

[18:27:20] <hseg> should've done this at initial install, now I have a bunch of clutter that I'm planning on eventually removing
[18:28:11] <hseg> df -h is showing lots of free space on my / and /var partitions, though
[18:28:26] <hseg> (83G, 7G resp)
[18:28:44] <hseg> so perhaps store them there?
[18:28:52] <thrice> just curious why swap partition wasn't an option
[18:29:22] <hseg> ah, that'd be because I've already partitioned the entire disk

[18:29:35] <hseg> and I'm uncomfortable repartitioning a live system
[18:29:42] <ectospasm> I was going to go with swap files on my redone QNAP NAS, but then I learned that Btrfs doesn't support swap files on multi-device filesystems.

[22:46:42] <Polochon_street> yep just doing alt gr + Z or X gives me "« »" as always. Don't know why the greater / less than were suddenly replaced by ‹›
[22:46:43] <ayekat> Polochon_street: Z on a qwerty layout is where the W on azerty is
[22:46:46] <Polochon_street> yes
[22:47:13] <ayekat> so... works as expected, I'd say - unless I'm looking at the wrong layout (see /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/fr, line 298++)
[22:48:06] <ayekat> that being said, I don't see any other way for getting </> other than using those keys - if you're missing them, then you might need to adapt your layout somehow (either with a custom layout or xmodmap or something...)

[22:49:07] <Polochon_street> I'll get tweak my layout then. Thanks!
[22:49:19] <ayekat> Polochon_street: have you been using some custom layout or xmodmap at any point? maybe something changed there...
[22:49:56] <Polochon_street> nop. Or maybe I did that a long time ago and forgot about it, but I doubt it
[22:50:10] <ayekat> Polochon_street: check if you recently updated xkeyboard-config - there's been an update recently, maybe the previous version had it different?
