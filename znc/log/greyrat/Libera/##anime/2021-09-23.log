[00:05:07] <JesseDesu> i'll format my SD card with ntfs so that windows and any of my linux computers with ntfs3g can read it
[00:05:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or, even better, you could use par2/par3 to create parity files for your data, so you can recover it if it gets corrupted, without help from the filesystem.

[01:10:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes, what is that legal theory?
[01:10:57] <Jigsy> O-Oh...
[01:10:59] <Jigsy> I moved it.
[01:11:28] <Jigsy> Basically it was someone saying...
[01:11:42] <Jigsy> "Abortion? BAN IT!" "Drugs? BAN IT!" "Something else? BAN IT!"
[01:11:52] <Jigsy> "Guns? Look, banning things never works. People will find a way to get them..."
[01:11:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bans realy only work for things you can ban.
[01:12:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That aren't trivally bypassed.
[01:12:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Removing all the freebies religions get though would go a long ways to deprecating them.
[01:13:03] <Nanobot> Aurora_v_kosmose: Whenever a state tries to pass an anti-abortion law, it ends up getting struck down by the courts. However, the process to get it to the courts in the first place involves suing the state government over the enforcement of that law. What Texas has done to work around that is to leave the enforcement up to the citizens instead of the state government: Citizens will be empowered to sue people, and the state government will financially 
[01:13:03] <Nanobot> reward them for doing so. Basically, a bounty system. The theory is that this means nobody can sue the state government over it, and therefore it can't be challenged on Constitutional grounds.
[01:14:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Except that requires a law to exist at all in order for it not to be thrown out of court, so responsability still ultimately lies with the state government for allowing it in the first place.
[01:14:24] <Nanobot> But, if this approach works for abortion, it would also work for anything else that the government isn't allowed to do on matters of Constitutionality, such as abridging the right to bare arms or freedom of religion.
[01:14:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I could sue someone for having red shoes. And I'd be laughed out of court if the case wasn't dismissed on applying.
[01:15:49] <Nanobot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I'm not arguing that the Texas legal theory will work, I'm saying that it's a dumb idea to even try, because the same approach could equally be used for a lot of things that would make those same politicians very upset.
[01:16:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: I know. I just mean that it's even dumber because they ultimately didn't even remove themselves from the chain of liability to start with.

[01:20:00] <Nanobot> I'm just waiting for California and New York to announce a firearms ban using the same legal theory. It'll be hilarious. 100% guaranteed someone will find a way to get a court to rule on it. And then the same thing can be used to strike down Texas' law.
[01:25:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Honestly, banning firearms is doomed to failure. Attempting to make manufacture of powder a lot harder is more likely to succeed but...
[01:26:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Airguns are a thing, and so are man-portable railguns (even if they're barely portable).
[01:26:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If something can kill a boar (airguns), it can definitely do a number on a human.
[01:27:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And to make airguns, you require no reasonably proscribable components.

[05:03:37] <MootPoot> it can take 8 or 10 3.5 inch drives
[05:03:40] <MootPoot> something like that
[05:05:52] <MootPoot> seems like its also the cheapest option at about 150
[05:06:06] <MootPoot> the other cases with this many slots are like 200-300

[05:10:13] <MootPoot> 7 hdds in it
[05:10:28] <MootPoot> and 2 of those hdd's will be swapped out as I get better ones / need more storage later
[05:10:54] <MootPoot> so starting off it'll have like 38TB of storage
[05:11:07] <MootPoot> after I'm done it should go to like 50-60tb

[05:15:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: A single 8TB HDD costs more.

[05:15:43] <MootPoot> yes, but I already have normal PC stuff
[05:15:56] <MootPoot> that I dont want to re-buy
[05:16:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: If it's SMR, check if it supports TRIM. If it doesn't, chuck it into a firepit
[05:16:20] <MootPoot> I have some SMR drives as last stage backups
[05:16:22] <MootPoot> thats it
[05:16:35] <MootPoot> I use NAS or Enterprise as first stage and active use
[05:16:44] <MootPoot> then retail seagates as second stage weekly backups
[05:16:51] <MootPoot> and SMR as final monthly backups
[05:17:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DM-SMR requires TRIM support to not become useless once you fill them. HA-SMR & HM-SMR don't.
[05:17:23] <MootPoot> I dont know how to check if my SMR drives are like that
[05:17:27] <MootPoot> is it in smart
[05:17:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: There are basically no Host-Aware/Host-Managed SMR drives on the market yet except some super-expensive enterprise stuff.
[05:18:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: As for TRIM support, I do not know if it's in smart, but hdparm can absolutely tell you
[05:18:15] <MootPoot> all I know is that all my SMR's are slow as fuck
[05:18:27] <MootPoot> and I only use them for final backups

[05:18:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If they're inordinately slow, that means you already filled them to uselessness. Though that usually goes sub megabyte/s
[05:19:03] <MootPoot> they can still do like 40 MB/s
[05:19:11] <MootPoot> but I keep them 80% or so full
[05:19:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At that point, if it doesn't support TRIM and you're lucky, using dd to write all-zeroes to them might get their controller to optimize the writes out and realize the whole drive is free.
[05:19:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or it might remain forever useless.
[05:19:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even if you delete everything on it.
[05:19:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's the part TRIM averts on SMR drives. It makes them aware of deletes.
[05:20:01] <MootPoot> fortunately I only have like 2 SMR drives
[05:20:09] <MootPoot> everything else is normal
[05:20:50] <MootPoot> current plan is to just swap crap into new case, then not buy any new storage till I can get my grubby fingers on HAMR drives
[05:21:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So if you go: sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdx # It'll tell you something about TRIM or Discard somewhere.

[06:26:48] <Ashl3y4> and you wake up ok from that dream?
[06:26:56] <amigojapan> Yeah
[06:27:18] <Ashl3y4> maybe its time to do some analysis of that dream, might mean something you're afraid of irl
[06:27:35] <amigojapan> Maybe
[06:28:52] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: I have not had that dream lately. But I did have it in the past a lot
[06:28:53] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: how many drives u got? u wanna get a new case?

[06:30:01] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: I actually felt lots of pain
[06:30:06] <ButterNoodle> yo amigojapan 
[06:32:33] <Ashl3y4> well I really can't say what to do then

[06:32:43] <Ashl3y4> or whatever his name is

[06:33:27] <ButterNoodle> skinner or piaget too Ashl3y4 
[06:33:29] <Ashl3y4> nope, didn't even know that was a thing 
[06:33:52] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: Freud said everything was sexual. Honestly I think he was a prevent himself
[06:34:51] <ButterNoodle> did you know famous psychologist karen horney studied sexual arousal and thats why we call it horney?
[06:34:55] <Ashl3y4> ButterNoodle: I'm not familiar with both of them, I didn't study philosophy a lot 
[06:35:05] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: I thought hot and sour soup was popular. But neither you nor darkwitch knew about it. It is one of my favourite Chinese foods
[06:35:16] <ButterNoodle> lol
[06:35:21] <ButterNoodle> Ashl3y4: its called psychology
[06:35:32] <Ashl3y4> ah

[06:35:52] <Ashl3y4> amigojapan: here in the USA fried rice is popular 
[06:35:58] <Ashl3y4> and that fat noodles

[06:36:19] <Ashl3y4> there are other dishes but fried rice and chicken is what most chinnese reastaurants are popular for 
[06:36:35] <ButterNoodle> sounds interesting amigojapan

[06:41:58] <Ashl3y4> honestly I'm not a big fan of most chinnese food in the USA

[06:42:12] <amigojapan> Right
[06:42:27] <Ashl3y4> the rice are sometimes tasteless and the chicken very dry
[06:42:36] <Ashl3y4> it's somewhat a hit or miss
[06:42:45] <Ashl3y4> I wish to eat some real chinnese food someday
[06:43:02] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: most "foreign foods"in other countries are fake
[06:43:41] <beaky> fake tea
[06:44:28] <Ashl3y4> I bet I could cook the food better
[06:44:33] <Ashl3y4> maybe some japanese food
[06:44:40] <Ashl3y4> but most japanese food sounds very raw to me

[10:03:13] <JesseDesu> cuz amigojapan introduced a new method i have to consider
[10:03:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Salt is a known-plaintext appended to passwords before hashing them to put them in the database, so that the hashes change.

[10:06:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: How do you get around issues updating the wordlist would cause?
[10:07:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Simply keep metadata of list version for the entries?
[10:07:34] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: what do you mean by wordlist?
[10:07:34] <JesseDesu> i dont like random generated passwords for certain sites
[10:07:36] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  you said to look for what..SMART on the SMR drive right
[10:08:11] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: then don't use this program for those sites
[10:08:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: SCSI disk information.
[10:09:22] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: do you mean the list of salts?
[10:09:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: If TRIM is there, you're mostly golden.
[10:09:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: I was assuming the seed was being used to set a RNG and you simply picked indexes out of a wordlist.
[10:10:24] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:10:31] <MootPoot> idk about SCSI disk info
[10:10:55] <MootPoot> but it seems that ths SMR drive has ACS-3 ( dunno what that is ) and SMART + NCQ
[10:10:55] <JesseDesu> i have a cheap lock box for my password logbook
[10:10:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Alternatively just try to run a TRIM/discard on the drive.
[10:11:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It'll fail if it doesn't support the command.
[10:11:05] <JesseDesu> anyone with a drill can easily defeat it
[10:11:14] <MootPoot> where a NCQ is native command queing
[10:11:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unless Windows has it fail silently, then I have no way to help.
[10:11:45] <JesseDesu> ok, all these solutions are too complicated for my smol brain
[10:11:51] <amigojapan> No Aurora_v_kosmose the algorithm basically does a hash on (master password+salt+site) and then just converts it so it also uses the symbols the user wants
[10:12:39] <JesseDesu> amigojapan, is your app portable
[10:12:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yeah, you're probably best-off figuring out how to manually trigger a TRIM run on the drive on Windows, and using a program that, if it fails, fails with an error telling you that it couldn't do it.
[10:12:56] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  I thought all the TRIMs were for ssds only
[10:13:10] <MootPoot> oh
[10:13:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Not exactly. It instructs the device controller that you're no longer using a range of logical addresses.
[10:13:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The way SMR drives work means you can't really just rewrite data in-place, it uses zones. It moves stuff between zones while idle and tries to free up new zones for writing to.
[10:14:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Telling it that you're no longer using stuff helps it create new free zones by garbage-collecting and moving old stuff.
[10:14:13] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: yes it will run on anything python3 will run on and tkintor can run. I tried it on Android

[10:23:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Oh, that simplifies things a lot. The overwhelming majority of USB->SATA/SCSI controllers don't pass-through TRIM except for ones meant for SSDs and a few exceptions.
[10:23:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So even if the drive itself would support it, it won't get the command and it'll fail.

[10:28:08] <MootPoot> so the only real way is to have a SATA connection to a computer from the ground up running linux
[10:28:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nah, there's a few newer USB->SATA/SCSI controllers that support it.
[10:28:25] <MootPoot> well, I never really fill them up 100%
[10:28:34] <MootPoot> I keep them at like 80% tops
[10:28:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They tend to be more expensive though, so you won't get them outside of SSD-specific USB enclosures or a few other exceptions
[10:30:30] <JesseDesu> they enforce a certain number of characters for passwords where i work
[10:30:47] <JesseDesu> its actually pretty high
[10:31:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: There should never be a maximum number of characters for passwords.

[10:31:20] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: Aurora_v_kosmose :I forget the name of the app but there is an app basically the same as mine that can input the password into the password field of the browser for you. In mine you need to copy and paste it

[10:31:22] <JesseDesu> theres no max
[10:31:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's not as if the hashing algorithms will output anything longer because you give them more data, they have a fixed output length. So the database sees the same anyway.
[10:31:32] <JesseDesu> but there is a min
[10:31:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: That's reasonable, and good. Because it allows you to use passphrases if you want.
[10:32:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Just remember, generate them randomly, not by human choice, because that's not random-enough and computers will laugh at the trivial amount of entropy your mind can generate.

[10:36:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A cryptographically-secure random number seeding a passphrase generator will output something that is unlikely to ever be output again by any other computer without spending ages regenerating from that same list.

[10:42:38] <MootPoot> so its fine if they get wiped every backup cycle
[10:42:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: If the controller notices the zeroes, that works, and indeed that's the only way to reset some of them.
[10:42:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: unless there were many universes in parallel
[10:42:54] <DunceCotus> like infinite number
[10:42:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: For some others there's simply nothing to be done.
[10:43:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the universe itself could be boundless
[10:43:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: In all cases this will of course shorten the lifespan of the drive by using more useless writes... but consider it becomes useless anyway if you don't do it, you're not exactly spoiled for choice.
[10:43:33] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  is there a way to know 
[10:43:40] <MootPoot> I know my specific drive model
[10:43:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: if that's the case that implies not reincarnation into another species
[10:43:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but into a variation of human
[10:43:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: as I have experienced
[10:43:55] <MootPoot> two of these ST8000DM004
[10:44:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: If your drive has gotten to the point where it basically can't write without stalling, you try to zero it, and you suddenly get appropriate write-speeds again, you do.
[10:44:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: a different version of yourself, your body, somewhere in the universe
[10:44:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: also an insect possibly
[10:44:33] <MootPoot> no way to know unless I actually try eh
[10:44:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what?
[10:44:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: There's an anecdotal account for that specific model: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/g7lqaz/how_i_refreshed_my_full_smr_drive/

[10:44:55] <DunceCotus> pteague: they produce us
[10:45:07] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: because of our egos
[10:45:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they are human egos

[10:45:30] <pteague> DunceCotus, wtf are you talking about?
[10:45:41] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the self could be inside an insect body
[10:46:06] <DunceCotus> pteague: basically your kid is connected to your desiring machines, they exchange flows (its unconscious), thus you can have the same dream even without explicitly telling them
[10:46:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: how so? It would not resemble at all our selves
[10:47:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: even if it were the case, we would think we were always insect

[10:49:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: in a human organisation yes
[10:50:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but that's because the ego is still present
[10:50:21] <DunceCotus> if the ego dissolves you become other
[10:50:45] <DunceCotus> I do not think ego is a matter of memory
[10:50:49] <pteague> oh, so pushing the boundary farther down the line ... yeah ... let's just make up further delusional stuff because the earth actually revolves around you & nobody else ... vs the sun is a quaint corner of nobody gives a fuck in the universe in a universe the size that your pea brain still can't comprehend the small blue dot
[10:50:51] <DunceCotus> its an unconscious organisation
[10:51:18] <DunceCotus> pteague: we are always in the middle, in a milieu
[10:51:34] <DunceCotus> this goes for whether you are human, insect, sun, galaxy etc.
[10:52:44] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: on psychedelic trips people have had their ego dissolve and when that happens they become everything
[10:53:06] <pteague> planet earth is such a dirt backward planet in central fly over space debris that nobody gives a fuck ... your superior blue dot in space is a fly-by back world hick planet that nobody would land on if they had a choice
[10:53:08] <DunceCotus> when we identify with an organisation is where ego enters
[10:53:25] <amigojapan> Yeah I have heard that DunceCotus . Still that was just a hallucination

[10:56:10] <DunceCotus> we can say its all the brain, but then so is perception of external reality
[10:56:22] <DunceCotus> its just a hallucination we can agree on

[11:19:00] <JesseDesu> Bco1981_2, why so small storage
[11:19:19] <Bco1981_2> this is just another play thing for a computer
[11:19:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Depends on the size of those drives. For data safety I use pairs, so I effectively get half the space I bought.
[11:20:00] <pteague> Bco1981_2, win7? wtf :facepalm: ... kidding ... the old gaming box i used while this was down was win7 ... but even after all the updates it was f'ed up -.-
[11:20:09] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I use triplets 
[11:20:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> raid5/6 might technically allow more space, but with the size of modern drives, that's asking for rebuild-failure.

[11:21:25] <MootPoot> I would out a lot more PC's in my basement if like...I had decent connection speeds down there 
[11:21:25] <JesseDesu> no basement
[11:21:41] <MootPoot> Best I can get is shit powerline 
[11:21:45] <JesseDesu> why a basement
[11:21:50] <JesseDesu> dont you wanna live in the penthouse
[11:21:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: 10gb switches can be found sometimes on ebay
[11:22:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or if your middlename is moneybags, you could go fiber.
[11:22:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The fiber itself is pretty cheap. The equipment for it though...
[11:22:46] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  the problem is wiring the cable down 3 floors
[11:22:49] <pteague> Bco1981, fine with me ... mine is about 10 yrs old & i just built this new 1 a little over 2 years ago which pisses me off i have to dig into my computer insurance savings account to fix it ... my headphones wouldn't work with it -.-
[11:22:58] <MootPoot> through walls and shit
[11:23:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Depends on how high those floors are. You might only need a relay top and bottom, without any in between.
[11:23:27] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: this place i live, i live on the 3rd floor, and each appartment gets a room in the building basement. i was able to get a 2nd room that had power. so i pulled a 115meter ethernet cable from my apartment to the extra room in the basement.
[11:23:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Depends on cable quality & length.
[11:23:56] <mixfix41> a fish wire helps a lot. and an unfinish basement would make it real easy
[11:24:09] <JesseDesu> Bco1981, sounds elaborate
[11:24:19] <Bco1981> in the basement i have two nas boxes and two pc's running 24/7
[11:24:27] <pteague> a basement is extra space you don't pay for ... plus it's typically much cooler than an attic ... & here i'm completely missing being able to solve all of the networking problems by just dropping a line into the basement ...
[11:24:48] <JesseDesu> i have a 2012 HP elitebook as my main computer
[11:25:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Just ensure you have drainage in case of flooding, and proper electrical safety setup.
[11:25:03] <Bco1981> when copying from a nas box up to my pc in my apartment to a ssd i get full 1gbit it flat lines at 110MByte/sec
[11:25:04] <JesseDesu> i keep the ubuntu on it up to date
[11:25:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ideally keep all machines on shelves at least half a meter above ground, so you have the time to move everything fast if you do get flooding.
[11:25:37] <zoidberg> switches are expensive af
[11:25:38] <pteague> Bco1981, you can't drop a hardline down to there?
[11:25:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> zoidberg: Really depends on how fast you want and managed vs not.
[11:25:52] <JesseDesu> just move to arizona
[11:25:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> zoidberg: Unmanaged 1gb is dirt cheap.
[11:25:55] <Bco1981> pteague: hardline ?

[11:32:18] <pteague> i'm almost at the point where ... you want to flush food down the drain, that's $100 a month, you want to flush grease down the drain, that's $100-200 a month, you want to do video chat, that's $100 a month ...
[11:32:44] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: i can run a command on my switch that tests the cable, and it reports all 4 pairs to be 115meter
[11:32:46] <JesseDesu> are QR codes sorta like a password
[11:33:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: That's probably based on the voltage drop.
[11:33:16] <zoidberg> the price varies a lot between unmanaged and managed/smart
[11:33:22] <pteague> JesseDesu, no, but only if you use 1234 as your password

[11:53:29] <MootPoot> Does anybody know if it matters if different drives in a raid array differ in speed
[11:53:53] <Bco1981> MootPoot: i have not tested it, just avoided it.
[11:54:05] <Bco1981> i suspect it slows down the other drives
[11:54:08] <MootPoot> I have 4 8tb SMRs and 1 8tb non SMR
[11:54:25] <MootPoot> should I make a raid 5 with 5 drives or just the 4
[11:54:43] <darkwitch> get some ASMR
[11:55:06] <Bco1981> raid 5 only uses 1 disk for parity, so you will get the space of 4 drives with 1 drive that can fail

[11:56:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: having redundancy is nice
[11:57:06] <amigojapan> Ah ok MootPoot 
[11:57:48] <MootPoot> so 5 drive RAID with one drive failure allowed
[11:58:11] <MootPoot> so what I think I should do....new case, 5 drive raid in there, then run 2x 18TB EXOS drives in my main system
[11:58:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah. You can always add another drive and rebuild the raid
[11:58:32] <JesseDesu> you have $800 for that
[11:58:33] <Bco1981> depending on how important the data is raid 6 has 2 allows 2 drive fail
[11:59:23] <MootPoot> its mainly just weeb backups tbh
[11:59:26] <MootPoot> 1 drive fail is ok
[12:00:06] <Bco1981> i working towards a 8x 12tb raid6 setup
[12:00:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: just rebuild it when a drive fails

[12:06:57] <darkwitch> are you trying to stay below a limit?
[12:07:06] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I allow myself 50g a day off carbs
[12:07:21] <amigojapan> Yes 50g
[12:07:23] <darkwitch> really? that is a lot
[12:07:32] <amigojapan> It's working
[12:08:00] <amigojapan> darkwitch: vegetables have carbs. Even greens
[12:08:08] <amigojapan> A low amount
[12:08:12] <MootPoot> can you mix and match drive sizes in raid 5
[12:08:33] <darkwitch> veggies have very different amounts of carbs
[12:09:55] <MootPoot> hmm
[12:10:01] <MootPoot> seems like you can but its wasted
[12:10:04] <MootPoot> so....
[12:10:22] <MootPoot> I guess my best bet is to buy 2-3 more 8tb SMR or non smr drives when on sale
[12:10:31] <amigojapan> MootPoot: "Any other RAID (RAID 5 or 6) Would result in you losing a LOT of space since,¬†yes you can mix and match drive sizes, but if you RAID 1 or 0 a 2TB and a 1TB you pretty much lose 1Tb of space on the 2Tb since they are not the same size. It is what ever the size of the smallest Drive is
[12:11:09] <amigojapan> Ah ok got it
[12:12:04] <MootPoot> well, I guess I know what I'm ending up with
[12:12:28] <MootPoot> 56tb raid 5 NAS
[12:12:40] <MootPoot> does running drives in raid boost random access performance as well?
[12:12:43] <MootPoot> or only serial reads
[12:13:15] <amigojapan> I think it does MootPoot 
[12:13:32] <MootPoot> sweet, that was one of my biggest problems anywya
[12:13:55] <MootPoot> I wonder if you can also use a caching drive
[12:14:16] <MootPoot> like how SSDs have DRAM or SSHDs have DRAM on them
[12:14:36] <MootPoot> can I have a raid 5 of 8 drives, then add maybe a cheap 256gb ssd as a caching drive
[12:18:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they did not have ssds yet when I worked at the server refurbishing center, otherwise I would probably know

[13:35:57] <MootPoot> but I dont think any woman with a working brain would want me lol
[13:36:06] <MootPoot> although I dont know any women either so
[13:36:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so you're punishing unsuccessful men?

[13:37:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: your dating site sounds terrible
[13:37:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe have a lower fee for lower income bracket
[13:38:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: no man would pay $5000 deposit for a glorified matchmaker site
[13:38:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it encourages long term commitment
[13:38:11] <MootPoot> tbh that's mostly how it works IRL as well
[13:38:17] <MootPoot> guys gotta cough up the money
[13:38:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: not for women
[13:38:19] <MootPoot> women get in free
[13:38:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you are not paying it unless you refuse to get married
[13:38:31] <MootPoot> women almost always wont date below their social standing
[13:38:45] <DunceCotus> why is marriage so important?
[13:39:20] <MootPoot> social stability, better environment for kids, keeps people getting socially isolated etc
[13:39:22] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: marriage is really about commitment
[13:39:22] <DunceCotus> marriage does not guarantee long-term commitment
[13:39:24] <JesseDesu> what are we really talking about here
[13:39:29] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: cum
[13:39:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: nope
[13:39:37] <JesseDesu> MootPoot, cum
[13:39:45] <DunceCotus> marriage is about cultural expectation
[13:40:13] <MootPoot> its not really even about marriage really
[13:40:20] <MootPoot> its just about social structures and stability
[13:40:25] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: marriage is not necessary for such stability
[13:40:30] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I can set up the site to see if people really won't sign up
[13:40:36] <MootPoot> if you have a pair live together for years on end without marriage its the same thing
[13:40:38] <DunceCotus> and kids may be better off not in nuclear family model
[13:40:56] <MootPoot> ALTHOUGH, if that happens you are effectively considered as married under common law
[13:40:57] <MootPoot> so
[13:41:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I wouldn't waste your time/effort
[13:41:30] <DunceCotus> (not that we can waste time/effort)
[13:41:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: how long before that is considered?
[13:41:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have plenty of time
[13:41:50] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  it varies depending on your local laws
[13:41:54] <MootPoot> here I think its like 2 years
[13:41:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: and I am a developer
[13:42:12] <DunceCotus> you are not curing social isolation and inceldom with a business model
[13:42:23] <DunceCotus> this is a societal problem
[13:42:29] <DunceCotus> (the problem is business)
[13:42:31] <amigojapan> Wow MootPoot that is soon
[13:42:43] <MootPoot> businesses do exist in a society, whats your point
[13:42:52] <DunceCotus> businesses destroy society
[13:43:05] <MootPoot> society lays the groundwork for businesses to exist
[13:43:56] <DunceCotus> businesses are there to exploit community until everyone is atomised
[13:44:26] <DunceCotus> they feed fear and illegitimate desiring of junk
[13:44:31] <MootPoot> the community allows the business to exist lol
[13:44:47] <DunceCotus> you can only have community without businesses
[13:44:47] <MootPoot> if the business truely was not wanted people would just burn it down
[13:44:49] <MootPoot> lol
[13:45:02] <MootPoot> pointless semantics
[13:45:03] <DunceCotus> of course people can desire their own repression
[13:45:45] <DunceCotus> business as usual is destroying ecosystem
[13:45:51] <DunceCotus> there is no future in capitalism
[13:45:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: in Canada so they have prenup marriages?
[13:46:06] <MootPoot> if you want, although prenups can be thrown out

[16:31:05] <Bco1981> it can
[16:31:15] <Bco1981> but you have to eat it first

[16:32:00] <amigojapan> Sadale: they put gold leaf on some fancy sashimi here
[16:32:01] <Bco1981> some years ago i heard of you can get gold pills so your poop would glitter.
[16:32:43] <amigojapan> But I think I rather flush the toilet
[16:32:54] <darkwitch> it seems the gold is electroplated on top of nickel on top of copper on top of fiberglass and epoxy

[18:10:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, where did you get all those money for all those drives and monitors and shit?
[18:10:24] <MootPoot> I live with family
[18:10:31] <MootPoot> so 100% of any money or job I get
[18:10:33] <MootPoot> I keep
[18:10:43] <Bco1981> you don't pay to live there ?
[18:10:45] <MootPoot> 100% disposable income :P
[18:10:48] <MootPoot> no way
[18:10:49] <Bco1981> and pay for som of the food ?
[18:10:52] <Sadale> I thought that you were jobless.
[18:10:53] <MootPoot> why would my family charge me rent
[18:10:58] <MootPoot> Sadale:  when I do have a job 
[18:11:00] <MootPoot> that is
[18:11:03] <Sadale> aw
[18:11:08] <Sadale> I see you don't save. You spend.
[18:11:14] <MootPoot> I save sometimes
[18:11:16] <Bco1981> you live there you take part in the household expenses
[18:11:19] * Sadale saves a lot :3
[18:11:30] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I dont do that but then they make me their errand boy
[18:11:37] <Sadale> Not that I've got a lot to save. I'm just being frugal xD
[18:11:49] <MootPoot> "MootPoot go get some X, go do Y"
[18:11:50] <MootPoot> etc
[18:12:07] <Bco1981> then again, it's hard to pay anything out of nothing...
[18:12:18] <MootPoot> but anyway, new job starts on monday
[18:12:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, congratz :3
[18:12:30] <MootPoot> first order -> pay off my student loan
[18:12:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, what kind of job it is this time? :3
[18:12:37] <MootPoot> programming again
[18:12:40] <MootPoot> I'm not a hooker
[18:12:42] <MootPoot> ok
[18:12:48] <Sadale> I'm disappointed.
[18:13:07] <Sadale> It's a hornor to be a hooker here in the internet :P
[18:13:12] <Sadale> s/hornor/honor
[18:13:22] <MootPoot> yes but anyway, on topic
[18:13:40] <MootPoot> swapping drives will both give me more capacity, and clean up the rats nest of wires
[18:13:42] <MootPoot> I have
[18:14:14] <MootPoot> I've been meaning to do something about this stupid SMR situation for a while anyways
[18:14:24] <Sadale> you rich
[18:14:36] * Sadale looking at his 1TB SATA SSD in shame
[18:14:38] <MootPoot> its about the only thing I have left on my todo that requires big money
[18:14:44] <MootPoot> aside from buying a motorcycle
[18:14:50] <MootPoot> and paying off my student loans
[18:14:55] <MootPoot> and getting laser eye surgery
[18:15:00] <Sadale> how much do you plan to spend for the HDDs?
[18:15:14] <Sadale> From what you've said, that sounds like a lot of money to me.
[18:15:20] <MootPoot> I spent 470 USD for the first one
[18:15:22] <Sadale> y'know 18TB HDD aren't exactly cheap
[18:15:35] <MootPoot> the second one should be covered by selling my 8tb drives
[18:15:56] <Sadale> I see. That's not too bad.
[18:16:03] <MootPoot> I could get a third if I wanted, since I'm changing banks
[18:16:10] <MootPoot> and the new bank is giving me 300 bucks to change to them
[18:16:19] <Sadale> lol
[18:16:21] <Sadale> That's funny.
[18:16:29] <Sadale> Is there any hidden cost tho
[18:16:37] <MootPoot> not that I found in the fine print
[18:16:45] <Sadale> That's an unusual incentive to get people to switch bank.
[18:16:51] <MootPoot> a few banks here do that
[18:16:57] <Sadale> I mean if it's like $50 I'd believe that. But $300 is a lot
[18:17:00] <MootPoot> at least 3 know of
[18:17:08] <Sadale> I see. Interesting.
[18:17:10] <MootPoot> well, they all have the same requirements
[18:17:20] <Sadale> Open account on all three of them then xD
[18:17:31] <MootPoot> they want you to switch banks, scehdule 2 automated bill payments with them
[18:17:41] <MootPoot> and have your salary deposited into them directly
[18:17:51] <MootPoot> for at least a month
[18:18:04] <Sadale> ah. That requires a bit more commitment than I thought.
[18:18:10] <Sadale> 2 autopaybills with a salary deposit.
[18:18:42] <MootPoot> but they do the deal pretty often
[18:18:49] <MootPoot> so in theory I could claim it at least once
[18:18:54] <MootPoot> from each bank
[18:18:55] <MootPoot> lul
[18:19:01] <Sadale> nice :D
[18:19:05] <MootPoot> 300+300+300
[18:19:05] <Sadale> That'd be 900 :D
[18:19:13] <MootPoot> MOAR HARD DRIVES

[18:35:01] <MootPoot> then
[18:35:03] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, I've thought about building a low-power PC as a NAS. It'd cost me like $100 to build one. And I've got unused HDD for that.
[18:35:08] <isekaijin> I already have different nicknames in different servers.

[18:35:27] <isekaijin> A serious one for programming-related servers, and a more flippant one for gaming-related ones.
[18:35:29] <MootPoot> most of the rest of my storage is just games and shit I redownload etc
[18:35:30] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, And I've done the math. It'd cost $20 annually to run. So after 5 years it'd cost as much as the PC cost itself.
[18:35:33] <ButterNoodle> the likelihood of one drive failing, and then losing another while rebuilding and losing everything is pretty common on raid 5
[18:35:39] <MootPoot> really?
[18:35:41] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: wow
[18:35:44] <ButterNoodle> $20

[18:36:42] <ButterNoodle> raid 10 or 6 otherwise.. if u have money to burn
[18:36:50] <JesseDesu> isekaijin, these are the wrong questions
[18:36:56] <ButterNoodle> 50 or 60 even

[18:38:54] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, compared with the cost of the device itself, $20 per year is quite something.

[21:54:35] <Bco1981_2> there is no usb ports
[21:54:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> How do you boot?
[21:54:57] <Bco1981_2> installed windows 98 se on hdd many years ago
[21:55:06] <Bco1981_2> initially boot disk
[21:55:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> My first computer had CD boot.
[21:55:49] <HeTo> a Pentium III should be able to boot from a CD, and the original Windows 98 installation could already also boot from CD
[21:55:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, you can still install Debian (and other linux) by bootstrapping the system onto a drive, chrooting into that, installing what you want, and then physically moving the hard-drive to the computer.
[21:56:18] <HeTo> and a Pentium III motherboard should also come with USB ports, probably can't boot from them though
[21:56:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> debootstrap (arch & guix have their own versions) is pretty much the only way to install on some SBCs
[21:56:45] <Bco1981_2> HeTo: had to double check, you are right there is 2 usb ports
[21:57:31] <Bco1981_2> so debian netinstall boot cd... maybe and irssi

[21:59:05] <HeTo> at that time BIOSes didn't tend to have boot menus yet, or maybe it was just about the time those started appearing, so you might need to check the BIOS settings for the boot order

But Eric remained silent, he merely stood there. Gazing over the crowd, his eyes 
[22:41:47] <Cryowolf> brimming with knowledge and wisdom. "What's wrong Eric, why do you not speak?" the Angel asked. Receiving nothing in response.

[22:48:47] <Cryowolf> This AI will successfully erradicate the human race if this continues
[22:49:04] <Cryowolf> It has named itself The Zuckerberg
[22:49:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You sure it isn't simply showing the truth as a means to lead to extinction instead?
[22:50:15] <Cryowolf> I'm sorry but can you rephrase that?

[22:51:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> By showing the truth of how idiotic people are, the "AI" is removing the desire to interact with such others.

[22:53:22] <Cryowolf> Nah, the thing is the AI has been preparing for this since the first multi choice virtual novels were released.
[22:53:29] <Cryowolf> Japan is only a testing ground
[22:53:34] <Cryowolf> it's going global now
[22:54:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lol
[22:57:19] <Urchin[emacs]> what was the deal with Asuka's EVA, I don't remember?
[22:57:24] <Cryowolf> The only way to protect yourself is to be social...but the AI was clever, it wrote itself a replica AI to prepare the rest of the world. With social media and smartphones, our ability to be social and to even be able to greet people properly has been severely diminished. With the introduction of the Weeb Factor in the West and much of the rest of the world. What we're facing here is an extinction event.

[23:02:14] <Cryowolf> When archeologists of future species look back on us to learn how we died. The tale of the waifus, the twitter wars, the facebook relationship status and the instagram ass shots will reveal a terrifying truth that we have refused to acknowledge until now. We're about as genuine as the game characters we play and talk to. Our appearance manipulated, our opinions garbage and only made loud because we have nothing better to do. With a 
[23:02:14] <Cryowolf> period in time that's long past, when the Facebook Relationship status genophage was constant.

[23:36:35] <MootPoot> I dont really care THAT much...but I would agree it is a cunt move anyway

[23:47:03] <MootPoot> I also live in a place with weaker currency then USD

[23:47:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So everything before the pandemic was too expensive to start with. And now it's even worse.
[23:47:42] <Sxem> google says xbox cloud gaming is in beta
[23:47:55] <Cryowolf> Sxem, you can also play xbox titles on cloud gaming
[23:48:01] <Cryowolf> Sxem, sure but it's open beta
[23:48:06] <Sxem> nice
[23:48:16] <Cryowolf> at least I have it and I didnt do a damn thing to get it
[23:49:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even my food costs more than it used to -_-
[23:49:25] <Cryowolf> yeah that's normal
[23:49:37] <Sxem> they are giving away all their xbox game pass games for free if you cloud game them?
[23:49:38] <Cryowolf> it happens all the time, all our lives
[23:49:50] <ButterNoodle> dood everything costs more
[23:50:04] <Cryowolf> Sxem, I can cloud game anything I want on their list, I just press play
[23:50:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Yeah, it's a problem.
[23:50:17] <Sxem> their website says it costs 15 per month
[23:50:26] <Sxem> which is too much for me
[23:50:34] <Cryowolf> first month should be 1 euro
[23:50:37] <ButterNoodle> since the covid economy.. sustenance has gone up around %20
[23:51:00] <Sxem> you paid 1 and will quit after 30 days?
[23:51:01] <Cryowolf> but you could just change paying stadia for paying for xbox
[23:51:12] <Cryowolf> I paid 1 and got 1 month + 2 for free
[23:51:14] <Sxem> i got 3 months of stadia for free
[23:51:16] <Cryowolf> so 3 months for 1 euro
[23:51:17] <ButterNoodle> like groceries, water.. fuel is a commodity but its gone up 50% or more
[23:51:24] <Cryowolf> but I dunno if you can get 2 months
[23:51:40] <ButterNoodle> thank god I can work from home.. the 2.5 hr commute I use to do would bankrupt me
[23:51:51] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, not around here in Sweden
[23:51:59] <Cryowolf> maybe cause we didn't shut everything down
[23:52:11] <ButterNoodle> plus the fucked everyone at my last job with a 9 month pay cut of 20%
[23:52:16] <Sxem> i am hoping someone will gift me a yearlong sub to xbox game pass on my bday some year
[23:52:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: NZ shut everything down better and got hit less than most countries.
[23:52:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because they actually did shut down. Including borders.
[23:52:48] <Sxem> i own 3,666 steam games tho, so i dont really need it
[23:53:02] <Cryowolf> theyre gonna get people infected with the  virus still
[23:53:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> half-measure pandemics are only slightly better than not doing anything at all
[23:53:08] <Cryowolf> unless they never let another soul in or out
[23:53:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: Considering they're surrounded by water and can quarantine all arrivals?
[23:53:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're in a uniquely good position to do it.
[23:53:47] <ButterNoodle> trebuchet the infected back
[23:53:54] <Cryowolf> they would become a very poor country if they isolated themselves to that degree

[23:55:24] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, people have to actually arrive there to deliver the stuff
[23:55:30] <Cryowolf> transmission and contagion can occur then
[23:55:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: Do we? And do we have treatment that ensures none of the long-term neural and organic damage found in a worrying proportion of infectees?
[23:56:29] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, weighing that against the mental health repercussions and the financial depression being faced, that could result in far worse consequences
[23:57:08] <Cryowolf> so using outliers isn't gonna be an argument for the majority
[23:57:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Would it?
[23:57:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Outliers are sub-10%. There are more cases than that. Well, vaccination might be helping.
[23:57:42] <Cryowolf> well a moment ago you were speaking about how depressed everyone was facing the pandemic they were willing to kill themselves over a gpu

[23:58:09] <Cryowolf> so which is it?
[23:58:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: The thing is that the window of opportunity was already pretty much lost. A properly-done quarantine at the start would've prevented this whole situation to start with.
[23:58:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There'd be no isolation or anything. Because infectees would be rare.
