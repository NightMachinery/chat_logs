[00:39:55] <electrostatic> sheetjs, basically I am caching server jsons local for a customer service portal (inside a module), and while I already have the strings immutable, it would be nice to be able to allow access to immutable object data as well
[00:40:03] <f0xb4t> yeah just found it out by uncle booble
[00:40:23] <GreenJello> f0xb4t, in the second one you're calling getWishlistForCustomer while handleRemove is running
[00:40:34] <GreenJello> before the request has even been sent
[00:40:39] <electrostatic> It just limts the number of stupid bugs other programmers can add. And it's too much data to want to run a parse every time you access it
[00:40:45] <qswz> also avoid naming a method getX() when it actually process things like in your case
[00:40:45] <sheetjs> a deep freeze is a good approach if you need to frequently get properties
[00:40:59] <sheetjs> storing the json string is good if it's infrequent

[02:08:35] <teut> I saw someone doing that on discord

[02:09:46] <Tabmow> Is there any way for a SPA app to force a logout on a backend API call when its token has expired?
[02:10:34] <teut> I know you are very good at the docs so thats why I asked just
[02:11:11] <qswz> Tabmow: sounds super bad UX
[02:11:19] <qswz> there location.reload()

[02:13:00] <Tabmow> qswz: It forces a logout on a route change... which is fine. But if the user had idled on the same route, and then does actions which don't change the route they can a cryptic access denied error. When in reality their token has expired... It's an edge case just wondering what my options are.
[02:13:25] <teut> thank you very much
[02:15:40] <lf94> How is anyone expected to do anything without being a webpack expert
[02:16:04] <teut> https://codesandbox.io/s/bitter-monad-bgg6l
[02:17:30] <kyshoc> Tabmow: a pattern I've seen in the past is catching the expired token signal (say a 401 response) from an API call and reacting to it by doing `window.location.pathname = '/login'`
[02:17:50] <teut> ok , it isnt showing up anything
[02:18:01] <teut> I ll try fixing it own my own
[02:18:53] <Tabmow> kyshoc: yeah I was thinking of doing something similar
[02:19:58] <kyshoc> the only thing to be careful of there is that you're going outside of whatever router you're using to force the route change directly, so you might end up blowing away data e.g. an unsaved form

[02:21:32] <Tabmow> Yeah, but I guess at that point my only option is to refresh the token and call the API again in the background
[02:22:10] <kyshoc> also, if "user idling" is a big concern for your app in particular, you could poll an auth check endpoint (I've seen `/users/me` as a convention here) periodically to catch the expired session _before_ the user makes a meaningful API call that's going to fail

[09:04:01] <matsaman> of course
[09:04:17] <ljharb> t notice anything normally, because  use `git log --oneline`, because multiline git logs are only for beginners
[09:04:33] <ljharb> but i've been trying the multiline one, and no difference
[09:05:10] <ljharb> ok the manpage says `Note also that you can give the -m option to any of these commands to force generation of diffs with individual parents of a merge.`
[09:05:25] <ljharb> so this harks back to, if you have that many merge commits, you suck at git, so maybe fix that problem first

[09:06:43] <theskillwithin> its usually pushed to origin like github, so u can easily see

[10:20:16] <sickdyd> what is the best way to deal with unique key props when mapping an array in React?
[10:20:23] <systemfault> theskillwithin: That wisdom
[10:20:43] <systemfault> theskillwithin: You reached your Ballmer's peak?
[10:21:11] <ljharb> sickdyd: what do you mean "deal with"
[10:22:18] <sickdyd> ljharb: what would be the best approach? I'm using a key={`${index}${aStringPropertyOfTheMappedElement}`}
[10:22:31] *** Joins: Celeo (~Celeo@user/celeo)
[10:22:38] <sickdyd> I just read that they should be unique only within the component, so I guess that's good enough
[10:22:41] <theskillwithin> thats a bit unnecsarry
[10:22:49] <ljharb> sickdyd: id you use the index at all, nothing else matters, just use the index
[10:23:08] <ljharb> sickdyd: if the mapped element's string property is unique, use it; if it's not, it's worthless
[10:23:23] <sickdyd> I see: I'll just use the index then
[10:23:33] <theskillwithin> 99% of the time index is fine
[10:23:38] <ljharb> nah using the index is not good
[10:23:45] <ljharb> it's only fine if the array never changes ordering
[10:23:52] <theskillwithin> yes
[10:23:52] <ljharb> otherwise it defeats the entire point of "key"
[10:23:58] <theskillwithin> ya
[10:24:17] <sickdyd> this array is not going to change (just a menu)
[10:24:29] <ljharb> sickdyd: then index, i guess

[10:24:35] <ljharb> sickdyd: but also, the menu item title should be unique, right?
[10:24:36] <systemfault> You can use the name of the menu elements...
[10:24:39] <ljharb> ^
[10:24:59] <sickdyd> in theory yes
[10:25:14] <ljharb> sickdyd: then use that, and if it's ever not, react will warn
[10:25:21] <sickdyd> but nothing prevents them from adding a duplicate entry, althought it would not make sense now
[10:25:36] <theskillwithin> i think tho understanding why is important
[10:26:35] <theskillwithin> how would you know if you reordered that array
[10:27:31] <sickdyd> for now it's just a static array I'm hardcoding in the website, it should never change, but never say never
[10:28:46] <ljharb> sickdyd: if you can rely on it not changing you can rely on the menu titles being unique

[12:07:22] <shan> look
[12:07:30] <shan> It is now common knowledge that in 1995 Brendan was given only 10 days to write the JavaScript language and get it into Netscape. Date handling is a fundamental part of almost all programming languages, and JavaScript had to have it. That said, it’s a complex problem domain and there was a short timeline. Brendan, under orders to “make it like Java” copied the date object from the
[12:07:31] <shan> existing, infant, java.Util.Date date implementation.

[18:53:25] <DPA> WebAssembly - I would like entire distros to have ports some day, but there is too much stuff missing. Things I think are a must are: threads, dynamic linking / libraries, something for signals, something to map/unmap btw. add/remove memories, something to suspend / resume threads.
[18:53:26] <DPA> I think dynamic linking and threads are probably the most important. I already waited a few years, I think dynamic linking should in theory be possible now? But threads, and all the other stuff, still either not ready or not yet possible?
