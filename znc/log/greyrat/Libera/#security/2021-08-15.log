[08:21:08] <ajak> use palladium
[08:21:16] <sam_> you should use the MapAddress option and then connect to palladium
[08:21:22] <sam_> Tor will internally map that domain to the onion
[08:21:22] <Lindis> the mapAddress is how it will avoid errors, I presume
[08:21:27] <sam_> you will then get a certificate which is valid
[08:21:32] <ajak> exactly

[10:32:39] <soulisson> Hash, just struggling with it, I slept a little bit but not enough. This is also very hot.
[10:34:01] <Hash> Try a glass of warm milk, darkness, and dampen a bedsheet very lightly, put on another sheet, and lay on it.
[10:34:14] <Hash> That'll keep cool the bed for a few hours.
[10:34:58] <PiRATA> but hotter is better

[10:36:25] <Hash> lay under a dry sheet, but cover it with a damp one and put the fan facing you
[10:36:50] <Hash> I come from a land where there is load-shedding and electricity is out in the summertime even for 12 hours at a time
[10:36:57] <Hash> We figure out ways to stay cool
[10:38:06] <Hash> You can also get a pendulum, (have to strike it every few hours), but pendulum is tied to a string that is wrapped around a pole that has a handfan on it
[10:38:32] <soulisson> Hash, how do you deal with the noises?
[10:38:33] <Hash> strike the pendulum and it moves the light fan back and forth for a few hours til it slows down
[10:38:37] <Hash> no noises.
[10:39:19] <Hash> just like random noises of people? Oh. I use noise to drown out noise.
[10:39:44] <Hash> When there is no electricity and things are louder anyway since there is little ambient noise from machiens or airconditions and fridges
[10:39:47] *** Quits: gmzamz (~gmzamz@user/gmzamz) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[10:39:49] <Hash> Not much you can do
[10:40:42] <Hash> In prison I would take toilet paper, pull out some ear wax, make it into a cone, put ear wax around the tapered end, stuff it into my ear, and drop a few drops of water to settle down the toilet paper
[10:40:51] <Hash> made fresh ear plugs every night.
[10:41:14] <Hash> Had to. Crazy people bang on grills and metal doors and make it impossible to sleep in incarceration
[10:42:07] <soulisson> Hash, ok, thanks for the advices :)
[10:42:42] <Hash> You should get foam ear plugs, they are easier on the ear. Get them from an pharmacy in USA (dunno other countries)

[10:44:16] <Hash> You have to squeeze them and roll them between thumb and finger so it's condensed, harder and tigher, then stuff it into ear, and hold your finger there until it decondesnes by itself and fills your ear canal
[10:44:37] <Hash> If you just try to put the ear plug in your ear, it won't go in properly and/or stay properly and will fall out while you're asleep
[10:45:12] <Hash> IF you don't hold your finger on it, it will decondense by itself and may pop uot a bit and not stay in there properly.
[10:45:32] <Hash> With my ear plug installation method in ear, it stays in all night and you can sleep.

[19:55:02] *** Joins: flx (~felix@user/felix)
[19:55:19] <PiRATA> ah, do you mean 2FA?
[19:56:20] <JohnDoe2> yeah, you know like zoho, or paypal demanding a phone number or else you don't log into your account
[19:56:43] <JohnDoe2> what I'm more interested in is how easy is it to steal someone's number?
[19:57:09] <Hash> Not very easy
[19:57:14] *** Joins: Xaldafax (~xaldafax@cpe-198-72-160-101.socal.res.rr.com)
[19:57:22] <JohnDoe2> I have heard of shadow SIMs and I'm ignoring you just letting your cell plan lapse and thus your number goes back into the provider's pool
[19:57:32] <NiLon> it is fairly strong but has massive social engineering vulnerability
[19:57:53] <PiRATA> 2FA with app > 2FA SMS IMO
[19:58:08] <JohnDoe2> cool. So my take on it is that it's absolutely stupid to rely on a simple text message to let someone into an account.
[19:58:22] <JohnDoe2> You have to at least have some security questions, or some other verification method after that
[19:58:27] <NiLon> there has been cases where youtubers etc. have been pwned using SMS when someone just called the operator and asked new sim for their lost one
[19:58:28] <PiRATA> but ebay sucks for only having 2FA SMS
[19:58:36] <JohnDoe2> crap.
[19:58:50] <maddwabbit> I imagine you could add another form of authentication, like using an authenticator app - at least on paypal
[19:59:05] <JohnDoe2> you can't - paypal only uses sms for verification
[19:59:06] <PiRATA> yes but not on ebay sadly
[19:59:37] <PiRATA> I lost my phone and had to call their customer service to regain access to my account
[19:59:56] <PiRATA> they refused to do so by email
[20:00:22] <PiRATA> which is understandable
[20:00:32] <JohnDoe2> so I bumped into the issue - would not let me log in without providing a cell number, called customer support, and got a supervisor who told me their system won't accept random phone numbers (VOIP providers) because they cross check with the phone company's database to confirm my name
[20:00:42] <JohnDoe2> ^ this is about paypal
[20:00:55] <maddwabbit> If you log into paypal from the browser, there is an option to use an authenticator app
[20:01:31] <JohnDoe2> maddwabbit never got the prompt, only a phone, and the supervisor said there's no OTP option, no verify by email, only cell phone numbers
[20:01:32] <maddwabbit> I feel like the phone number is required though
[20:01:46] *** death916_ is now known as death916
[20:01:52] <rty> there is also an option to not overcomplicate things and just use login and password
[20:02:04] <JohnDoe2> not when you register, only when they want to verify your identity ( maybe some random IP outside of usual geographical area? )
[20:02:36] <PiRATA> JohnDoe2: PayPal? ahhh sorry
[20:02:39] <JohnDoe2> so anyway, long story short: got a twilio number, set it as my number on paypal, got on a VPN with an IP from belarus, and hacked into my own account in 2 minutes. You put in the code, then the new password and bam, you're in.
[20:02:44] <PiRATA> was thinking about ebay
[20:02:54] <maddwabbit> lol its a good thing you brought it up.. i had the wrong number in mine ðŸ˜… yikes
[20:02:59] <JohnDoe2> yeah
[20:03:11] <JohnDoe2> so that part of the security is absolutely useless if you ask me.
[20:03:22] <maddwabbit> yep
[20:03:30] <JohnDoe2> the only benefit is paypal now has a cell phone number to match your name  = better package for advertiser
[20:04:12] <JohnDoe2> zoho does the same thing - you can log in with just the phone number
[20:04:38] <JohnDoe2> ridiculous to think that such big companies have so little regard for security. I'm very disappointed.

[20:07:10] <maddwabbit> yeah it didn't ask for any verification or anything to remove the old number, I just put my new one in.
[20:07:18] <JohnDoe2> :D
[20:07:43] <JohnDoe2> I thought about posting videos like that on youtube or something to raise awareness but it won't make a difference. People won't stop using zoho or paypal because it's insecure
