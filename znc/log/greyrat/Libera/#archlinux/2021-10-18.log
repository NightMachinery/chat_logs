[00:00:08] <susi> but if the govt got handle on your /boot
[00:00:09] <marcello42> guess I have to but
[00:00:13] <susi> that's what I meant SysGhost 
[00:00:40] <marcello42> you always need to trust other people even if you would build your own kernel with own OS
[00:00:59] <susi> nah, I just check the source code

[00:01:08] <marcello42> microcode and the firmware of your bios and of course the intel management engine
[00:01:14] <SysGhost> if the Arch is compromised to a level where the main repos are... comprommised I'm running the wrong distribution. Nothing matters in that case
[00:01:34] <susi> but I meant your unencrypted /boot, not that
[00:02:02] <marcello42> I am not sure if secure boot is supported by arch but maybe that would help here
[00:02:03] *** Joins: imp (~imp@192-141-191-231.alternativaip.net.br)
[00:02:15] <susi> it is indeed possible
[00:02:22] <drocan> if your threat model is someone swiping your laptop and swapping out your kernel then sure
[00:02:25] <marcello42> at least the bootloader gets checked if the keys match
[00:02:31] *** Joins: andyrtr (~andyrtr@archlinux/developer/andyrtr)
[00:03:02] <marcello42> drocan, I guess someone really wants you then and perhaps will be successful anyway ;)
[00:03:31] <drocan> i hope not geez
[00:03:40] <marcello42> :D
[00:03:45] <susi> the govt could easily plug your disk and replace the kernel on unencrypted /boot when you're not home
[00:03:58] <susi> that's a reasonable scenario... or some evil neighbour
[00:04:17] <marcello42> they also could easily replace your keyboard and log all your typing
[00:04:25] <susi> that's not that easy
[00:04:26] <marcello42> then unecnryption is even easier
[00:04:39] <SysGhost> as drocan mentions, having ones laptop swapped out and in under my feet it means NSA, CIA, KGB, Interpol, MSS, 3PLA, ... or whoever it is, they put down enough resources on me it really doesn't matter what I do. They'll get everything one way or another.
[00:04:42] <marcello42> it is easier to modify the keyboard
[00:04:50] <topcat_001> The so called "evil maid" threat model (tampering with the kernel) is interesting but too much for me personally.
[00:05:02] <marcello42> SysGhost agreed 
[00:05:25] <topcat_001> I also just have / encrypted and /boot open.
[00:05:41] <drocan> I encrypt / because then if someone nicks my laptop at starbucks they can't access pictures of my butt, and I'm content with that
[00:05:48] <marcello42> susi you could also go for a SED but you never know what the firmware is
[00:05:56] <marcello42> but some goes with bitlocker from microsoft
[00:05:59] <marcello42> same*
[00:06:11] <susi> SED?
[00:06:13] <marcello42> same for me @drocan
[00:06:18] <marcello42> self encrypted drive
[00:06:20] <topcat_001> drocan: same (minus the photos ;))
[00:06:35] <marcello42> it is transparent for the OS so the OS and everything including MBR is encrypted
[00:06:44] <susi> nah, SED's vulnerability is that someone snaps the computer while it's running
[00:06:57] <susi> very easy to happen, the govt comes to your door, and cuffs you before you can do anything

[00:10:04] <A17_> Hydragyrum: power button immediately doesn't matter if they snag your ram and drop it in some liquid nitrogen
[00:10:09] <susi> however LUKS is still better than SED, with strong enough encryption... they might not transfer the computer powered on to the lab

[00:13:57] <susi> timofonic: check the flags, you can pretty easily find the answer to your question, look for words like recursive or dependencies
[00:13:59] <A17_> power off or not, if they toss your RAM in some liquid Nitrogen and get all, or even most, of that (terminology) in their hands, it won't matter
[00:14:19] <A17_> key/signature/whatever
[00:14:32] <topcat_001> mikey: The optimal method depends on the architecture of your GPU: < Turing = nvidia-xrun or optirun, >= Turing = PRIME offloading (the official way).
[00:14:33] <marcello42> from my understanding it is the key which will be unlocked by a password (similar to LUKS) and the en/de cryption algorithm is build in the controller

[00:16:03] <A17_> mikey: definitely

[00:17:04] <A17_> Anyways, I feel it's getting into another territory, so I'm tapping out.
[00:17:09] <susi> I guess LTE remote-controlled disk-shredders attached to the disk/firmware are pretty common these days
[00:17:21] <susi> just in case
[00:17:31] <A17_> imagine if one of those malfunctioned lol

[06:54:25] <feinedsquirrel> The router wiki page warns at the top to not run services available to the outside world. Does this include a VPN server, e.g. wireguard? Additionally, if I were to port forward through the router to a physical machine running wireguard, is it discouraged to run other services on that machine, e.g. an ftp server (i.e. should my vpn server be running on separate hardware from a machine running...
[06:54:32] <feinedsquirrel> ...services for my home network)?
[06:55:42] *** Joins: prifici_ (~patri@user/prifici)
[06:56:53] <sheep> it's a general principle in security. You generally should not allow routers to run anything other than what needs to be on the router because vulnerabilities in other things running on the router could break the router's firewalling

[07:04:19] <sheep> the firewall could still restrict what the VPN can access

[07:13:13] <feinedsquirrel> oh, I see. That leads me to another question, but if I should ask it on a different channel/forum, just say. Say I set up a firewall that allows access to a specific port on a specific machine. I've read that you are essentially trusting the security of the program listening on that port. I've also read that if you have no listening ports, you aren't really susceptible. ...

[07:13:38] <sheep> you can't connect to a port that isn't listening
[07:13:38] <feinedsquirrel> ... So why have a firewall at all, if you are going to open it only to ports that have services listening anyway?
[07:14:01] <sheep> it's to restrict what kind of traffic can acccess the open ports
[07:14:28] <sheep> and also to prevent things like flooding attacks against closed ports, which in rare circumstances could still exploit theoretical vulnerabilities
[07:15:30] *** Joins: cyphertite (~cyphertit@wireguard/tunneler/cyphertite)
[07:15:54] <feinedsquirrel> Ok, I've been reading some, and know that deep packet inspection is a thing, but I don't know much more about it yet. Would it be necessary to restrict what kind of traffic can access the open ports, as you say?
[07:16:12] <feinedsquirrel> and I haven't heard of flooding attacks. interesting. I'll have to read more about that, too.
[07:16:43] <sheep> it depends on what sort of threat model you're dealing with, but unless you're dealing with very valuable services, it's probably not necessary

[07:27:32] <feinedsquirrel> oh. Fair enough. So, in your opinion, access to a basic home network (that perhaps serves {ssh,ftp,password manager}) from outside, opening the firewall only to a wireguard-listening port is probably good enough? What if I were to throw in opening a port for nginx to serve that basic html site?

[08:11:21] <specunix> what just happened?

[08:12:21] <grawity> 07:23 -i- Wallops from ghoulguy (x@libera/staff/glguy): Maintenance time! I'll be restarting two servers tonight for software upgrades. Population is pretty low on them, so the splits shouldn't be too bad.
[08:12:46] <feinedsquirrel> specunix: you mean the long list of leaves and joins?
[08:12:53] <specunix> feinedsquirrel: yeah
[08:13:33] <specunix> grawity: mefistofeles: huh right
[08:13:46] <feinedsquirrel> mefistofeles: what is a netsplit?

[08:14:16] <mefistofeles> feinedsquirrel: there are different servers in Libera network, sometimes some of them get disconnected from the network, that's a split
[08:14:24] <grawity> feinedsquirrel: an IRC network is called a "network" because it is, in fact, a network of interconnected servers that share the same channels
[08:14:26] *** Joins: Carp (~rue@1-162-45-75.dynamic-ip.hinet.net)
[08:15:12] <grawity> libera in particular tries to make it feel less like a network and more like a single unit, but it's still made out of [checks /lusers] 20+ separate hosts, connected like a tree
[08:15:52] *** Joins: blaklistd (~blaklistd@user/blaklistd)
[08:16:12] <feinedsquirrel> grawity: and so by your comment that population is low, means that i.e. the server that responded to my connection request may have a relatively lower number of active users, and when you restart that machine, it temporarily disconnects and reconnects those users, perhaps through a log file or something?
[08:16:13] <grawity> so if a server loses connection to its upstream hub, it looks like all users behind that server have quit (usually with "serverA serverB" as their quit message)

[08:17:33] <feinedsquirrel> maybe this is not how it works, but before shutdown, it records the list of connected users to a file, and when it reboots, tries to automatically reconnect those.

[08:17:44] <grawity> not how it works at all, no
[08:18:54] <grawity> the thing is an IRC connection *is* really a live TCP connection – not like discord/matrix where you're just kinda "always online"
[08:19:11] <grawity> so the server cannot make that connection back to its clients
[08:19:24] <feinedsquirrel> the kicked off users have to re-connect themselves, manually.
[08:19:36] <grawity> if it reboots and kicks everyone off, most clients themselves automatically try to reconnect

[08:20:00] <feinedsquirrel> That was my next question. cool. Thanks for the explanation!
[08:21:49] <grawity> if a real "netsplit" happens i.e. connection between *two servers* is lost, but both of them are still up – then they will resync when the connection is reestablished

[11:38:01] <grawity> in general, if your CPU doesn't have specific acceleration for the block cipher, it will definitely make reads slower, see `cryptsetup benchmark`

[11:39:33] <grawity> and some ciphers handle reads and writes differently, e.g. aes-xts can use AESNI to full extent according to that benchmark but aes-cbc only for reads, not writes
[11:39:43] <specunix> I'm not particularly paranoid, but if the downsides aren't to bad, then I might as well use it

[14:07:31] <lionkor> Hello everyone! I'm having some issues with some arduino nano clone that I got from my university. This board worked a few days ago when plugged into a different machine, but on my arch it doesn't appear as a /dev/ttyUSB*. `lsusb -tv` shows it switching from `Driver=` (empty driver) to `Driver=usbfs` in around 1-second intervals, but /dev/ttyUSB never shows up
[14:08:25] <Namarrgon> is brltty installed?
[14:08:33] <th0rne> Speaking of alad, I was building something with aurutils, and I accidentally ran out of space on the drive that the built package was supposed to go to, but rather than failing and telling me to fuck off, it was like, "couldn't move package to the location, it's at /some/other/place/ instead now".
[14:08:38] <th0rne> I thought that was pretty cool.

[20:18:07] <Namarrgon> are any devices listed in the output tab of pavucontrol?

[20:25:35] <A17_> Scimmia: "how is "bypassing...boot loader processes" exactly the same as starting the bootloader again?" you know, you don't have to only contribute when you have a witty, snappy comeback to something. If you could go ahead and just solve all my problems for me, that'd be great. ;)
[20:26:25] <A17_> On a serious note, I just meant that they were bringing the system back up from essentially halt, rather than restarting the board.
[20:26:30] <Scimmia> you already dismissed exactly what you were asking for, so what's the point?
[20:28:08] <A17_> The point was maybe someone would contribute some secret knowledge they gained over the years where the operating system could be reloaded from a HALT, rather than going through 5 minutes of unnecessary POST and configuration checks
[20:28:51] <MrElendig> A17_: ericcson solved that in the 90's
[20:29:43] <A17_> Care to drop a piece of terminology or something I can research? My server's boot time is 98% POST and 2% arch

[20:32:02] <A17_> So the answer is that it's just not possible? That blows my mind. I find it difficult to conceive why we can't stop all of the operating system processes to get it to where the environment is almost like it is after post except that one little thread or whatever you want to call it waiting to kick open the bootloader and start again.
[20:32:29] <A17_> I guess I just don't know enough about the complexities to know why that isn't possible, but I guess that's also a "me problem"
[20:33:09] <thurstylark> My answer would be to troubleshoot why post takes 5 minutes because damn
[20:33:31] <A17_> I mean, it might be an over exagerration, but it's not far off, and it's because it's a server

I losetup'd it into a loop device. lsblk shows the correct partitions and sizes (vfat ESP @ 512M and rest is btrfs part). However, when I attempt to mount it, I get mount: /mnt/tmp: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0p2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.

[23:39:17] <A17__> things are easier to troubleshoot when you have specific errors
[23:39:28] <thurstylark> journal also includes dmesg fwiw
[23:39:34] <jonathon> NetSysFire: i guess at least that one explicitly says it's based on Arch, rather than being something of or for Arch :/

[23:50:32] <Fr0stBit> Hello!
[23:50:48] <A17__> !welcome
[23:50:49] <phrik> Welcome to #archlinux, tell us how you fucked up.
[23:50:55] <Fr0stBit> Quick question, should I use UUID or PARTUUID when specifying mountpoints?
[23:51:06] <A17__> in fstab? the UUID
[23:51:35] <Fr0stBit> I know the difference, but why?
[23:51:36] <A17__> scraaaaaattch that
[23:51:39] <A17__> one second
[23:51:43] <A17__> let me confirm my bullshit
[23:52:19] <A17__> Yea, UUID
[23:52:21] <A17__> in fstab
[23:52:33] *** Joins: Vonter_ (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[23:52:55] <Fr0stBit> Afaik UUID is the filesystem unique identifier that changes when a partition is re-formatted and PARTUUID is the GPT partition unique identifier that changes when re-partitioning a disk?
[23:53:07] <Fr0stBit> If so, why do we prefer one over the other?
[23:53:30] <A17__> Because formatting and partitioning are two separate things
[23:53:47] <bertptrs> also not all file systems have a UUID property, but all of them have a PARTUUID
[23:54:01] <bertptrs> (assuming you used GPT)
[23:54:13] <A17__> the former is setting up a format for the file written to the partition to use, the latter is mapping out sections of the disk TO set up as a specific format
[23:54:36] <Fr0stBit> I meant why do we prefer the UUID instead of the PARTUUID
[23:54:54] <bertptrs> we don't necessarily, I prefer PARTUUID
[23:54:59] <Fr0stBit> Is one more 'unique' or more collision-free than the other?
[23:55:05] <A17__> honestly Fr0stBit, you can probably use the PARTUUID too just the same way
[23:55:08] <bertptrs> one is more generally applicable
[23:55:12] <A17__> by specifying PARTUUID
[23:55:20] <A17__> fstab should read either
[23:55:32] <Fr0stBit> A17__: I know that, just making a poll
[23:55:36] <A17__> UUID is just the common convention, but there's more than one way to skin an fstab
[23:55:52] <Fr0stBit> A17__: ^ that is one point
