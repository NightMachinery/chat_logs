[16:49:34] <gtlsgamr[m]> Firefox with its increasingly political stances, and with chromium being a “just works” browser
[16:49:34] <Tor[m]> <gtlsgamr> "i switched to chromium since..." <- Why ? 
[16:50:07] <labrador> I don't like the idea of using chromium gtlsgamr[m] 
[16:50:24] <labrador> Its a browser engine developed by google...the world's largest ad company
[16:50:38] <labrador> Fuck me cuz that sounds like a gigantic conflict of interest
[16:51:05] <gtlsgamr[m]> True. But ungoogled chromium exists.
[16:51:05] <Tor[m]> Use both
[16:53:08] <Tor[m]> Doesn't it contact google servers iirc
[16:53:08] <gtlsgamr[m]> I dont think so

[17:28:24] <telegram_1346084> w3m is like an almost browser for me, like how ytfzf is for youtube

[18:09:10] <labrador> oh
[18:09:22] <labrador> I think using sixel is also an option
[18:09:35] <labrador> many advanced terminals support it

[18:31:21] <gtlsgamr> so its is pretty quick
[18:36:16] <AryaK[m]> kitty icat is way better
[18:36:20] <AryaK[m]> ucollage is interesting project
[18:36:24] <AryaK[m]> but it only supports x11 
[18:36:30] <AryaK[m]> because ueberzug
[18:36:34] <AryaK[m]> but i use wayland
[18:37:58] <gtlsgamr> AryaK[m]: what is all this you speak of
[18:38:04] <gtlsgamr> what advantage does it have or st?
[18:38:39] <AryaK[m]> ucollage uses ueberzugh
[18:38:50] <AryaK[m]> which works on many terminals 
[18:38:54] <AryaK[m]> but doesnt work on wayland
[18:38:59] <AryaK[m]> ucollage is like sxiv
[18:39:02] <AryaK[m]> but in the terminal
[18:40:29] <gtlsgamr>  what advantage does it have over st? I have heard a lot about kitty.. but hesitant to switch from st that "just werks"
[18:58:21] <mxbl> just stick with st
[18:59:13] <AryaK[m]> it has some really cool features
[18:59:25] <AryaK[m]> like download of remote files
[18:59:28] <AryaK[m]> unicode selector
[18:59:34] <AryaK[m]> really nice image previewr
[18:59:42] <AryaK[m]> and is really extensibile and configurable
[18:59:48] <mxbl> so
[18:59:51] <AryaK[m]> and the conf file is very easy to read and understand
[18:59:55] <mxbl> wdym by unicode selector
[19:00:25] <AryaK[m]> its really useful
[19:00:33] <AryaK[m]> dmenu based unicode selectors arent very feature rich
[19:00:44] <mxbl> so
[19:00:47] <mxbl> wget
[19:00:52] <mxbl> unicode selector, which i don't need
[19:00:56] <mxbl> ueberzug
[19:01:07] <mxbl> extensibility which st already has
[19:01:51] <labrador> AryaK[m], i think all of that pales in comparision to gpu acceleration and kitten support
[19:02:03] <labrador> its a next gen terminal
[19:02:14] <mxbl> kitten?
[19:03:07] <AryaK[m]> its their very extensible plugin system
[19:03:11] <labrador> mxbl, its a plugin ecosystem for kitty
[19:03:12] <AryaK[m]> how did i forget gpu accel
[19:03:18] <mxbl> so
[19:03:23] <mxbl> like st patches
[19:03:44] <labrador> Nah mxbl its way more extensible with a clear api
[19:03:52] <labrador> No patching the gnome shell source
[19:04:07] <labrador> That patching becomes hard to manage fast
[19:04:42] <AryaK[m]> its like you can use dwm or xmonad or whatever (or) you can use twm and patch in everything from tiling to bar
[19:04:56] <mxbl> sounds like a bloated program that doesn't follow the unix philosophy at all
[19:05:09] <labrador> mxbl, doesn't need to though
[19:05:13] <labrador> Also bloat is subjective
[19:05:33] <mxbl> true
[19:05:42] <AryaK[m]> i use emacs btw 
[19:05:44] <AryaK[m]> so bloat == idc
[19:06:10] <AryaK[m]> i mean i dont use it as much as i used to but using emacs has changed me a bit :p 
[19:06:36] <labrador> AryaK[m], I'd rather not touch that epitome of bloat that is emacsOS
[19:07:15] <mxbl> the only terminal that could be more bloated would be some kind of terminal emulator using electron
[19:07:22] <labrador> mxbl, like hyper
[19:07:27] <labrador> It looks beautiful though
[19:07:39] <mxbl> oof
[19:09:26] <AryaK[m]> there is terminus term which  uses electron
[19:09:32] <AryaK[m]> and the many browser based terminals
[19:11:13] <mxbl> i'll stick with st
[19:11:18] <mxbl> and foot on wayland
[19:12:41] <gtlsgamr> coolretroterm is also electron i think
[19:13:31] <AryaK[m]> yeah
[19:14:59] <labrador> mxbl, can st scroll
[19:15:01] <labrador> lololol
[19:15:04] <mxbl> yes
[19:15:14] <mxbl> using either scroll
[19:15:18] <mxbl> or a patch
[19:15:21] <mxbl> or tmux
[19:15:45] <gtlsgamr> yep
[19:15:48] <gtlsgamr> st can scroll
