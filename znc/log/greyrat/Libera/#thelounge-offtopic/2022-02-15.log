[02:53:19] <xnaas> ope
[02:53:20] <xnaas> https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/sshwzp/plexamp_v40_released/
[02:53:26] <xnaas> plex did React so now you have to MaxLeiter /s
[03:02:11] <MaxLeiter> good idea
[03:02:28] <xnaas> Should base every decision for TL on what Plex does
[03:02:38] <xnaas> stop all self-hosting features and push subscription services
[03:02:39] <xnaas> üòÇ
[03:04:00] <MaxLeiter> not really related but I grew up passing their HQ and always wanted to walk in with a (shitty) resume to ask for an internship
[03:04:08] <MaxLeiter> now im pretty happy i didnt d:
[03:04:08] <xnaas> fair
[03:04:13] <xnaas> on both points
[03:04:14] <xnaas> haha
[03:14:49] <kinghat> ppl love it as a self-hosted music app
[03:15:03] <kinghat> i dont want to give plex monies though
[03:15:32] <kinghat> lubs jellyfin
[03:15:38] <kinghat> sorry
[03:15:54] <xnaas> I selfhost my music using navidrome, personally. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[03:16:04] * kinghat ‚ù§Ô∏ès jellyfin ü§ó
[03:16:12] <xnaas> For TV/movies though, Plex's client support is just too good.
[03:16:21] <kinghat> ya
[03:16:29] <kinghat> until this gets some traction: https://github.com/Dusk-Labs/dim
[03:17:01] <xnaas> I want to use jellyfin, but every time it's "fuck there's no client for X" or "this glorified webplayer on Y sucks ass" :P
[03:17:13] <xnaas> but it'll get there, in time, I'm sure
[03:17:18] <xnaas> FOSS is slow, since it's all volunteer time
[03:17:21] * xnaas gets that
[03:17:24] <kinghat> didnt you just say plexamp is in react?
[03:17:26] * xnaas isn't a complete asshole
[03:17:47] * xnaas doesn't use plexamp or Plex for music at all ;P
[03:17:48] <xnaas> but yes
[03:18:32] <kinghat> i dont really care what its in as long as it doesnt suck or i cant tell the difference.
[03:18:40] <xnaas> fair 'nuff
[03:19:25] <xnaas> looks like the last time I tried jellyfin was April 2021
[03:19:25] <kinghat> jellyfin is moving to all native
[03:19:57] <kinghat> if they arent already
[03:20:38] <xnaas> Yeah, I see some dev comments on Reddit from time-to-time
[03:20:55] <xnaas> tbh, I'd switch right now if their WatchTogether implementation is better
[03:21:14] <xnaas> queuing 1 episode at a time of a show you're trying to binge with someone gets really old lol
[03:22:49] <xnaas> (though I guess no "switch" is required; running both at the same time isn't really an issue other than maybe competing CPU/GPU resources)
[03:23:51] <xnaas> I suppose the thing I would actually miss most would be PlexPy (now called Tautulli)
[03:24:20] <xnaas> I know jellyfin has some built-in stats stuff, but it's not the same level.
[03:24:46] <shadoozo> react makes me go ew
[03:25:05] <shadoozo> not a fan :P
