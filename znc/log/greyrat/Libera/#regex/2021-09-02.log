[15:46:06] <re101-moth-15> I'm trying to find the block of text which begins with the word, "CLINICAL" and replace only the last `</ol>` tag in that block and `<ol>` and the hyphen/dash on the immediate next line but not do anything if there is a number in the next line (in the same block).
[15:46:07] <re101-moth-15> The `<ol>` should be replaced with "outlaw" and the hyphen/dash on the next line should remain as it is and the last `</ol>` tag in that block should be replaced with "bylaw"
