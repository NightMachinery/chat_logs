[23:40:25] <skye0> starting to have a hard time with figuring out what game I want to play
[23:40:53] <skye0> if i fuck up a save file in dynasty warriors 9: empires, it's fucked. i hate the lack of free mode in that game.
[23:41:03] <skye0> at least i can cheat my way through the sims 4
[23:44:29] <xMopx> play dwarf fortress
[23:48:28] <skye0> i prefer 3d games usually
[23:49:17] <skye0> i'm feeling fucking worn out. hate my job because it reminds me of gender issues in large part but i kind of need it too. they'll need me too because they experience so much fucking turnover
[23:52:10] <ThePendulum> it will take some perseverence to get yourself into a position where you can get a job you enjoy more
[23:53:52] <xMopx> dwarf fortress has 3 dimensions lol
[23:54:14] <xMopx> dwarves dig caves you kinda need 3 dims for that to happen
[23:56:27] <skye0> ThePendulum the job i'm in constantly reminds me of personal issues. sorry if i'm repeating myself here
[23:56:40] <skye0> i tried applying for a job but am having trouble getting the right paperwork in for it. i had an offer too!
[23:56:55] <skye0> i might have to withdraw that application because the only alternative would be to keep them waiting for much longer
[23:57:28] <ThePendulum> do you think it would be different at another job?
[23:57:30] <unfinity> ・゜゜ ​ ・。。・゜゜\_0​< QU​ACK!
[23:57:45] <skye0> ,bef
[23:57:45] <unfinity> skye0 you befriended a duck in 14.931 seconds! You have made friends with 96 ducks in #datahoarder.
[23:57:55] <skye0> that is a good point, idk wtf i want to do
[23:58:19] <skye0> currently a pharmacy assistant. a handful of employees including perhaps my manager are why i can't be completely open about my personal issues
