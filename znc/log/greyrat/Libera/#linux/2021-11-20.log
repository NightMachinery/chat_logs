[00:02:02] <kveroneau> Skaface82, yeah, that'd definately increase the performance.  Local SPICE to libvirt is generally pretty good for what I do, and even Direct2D games work over local SPICE with no issues.
[00:02:07] <xb0o2> Why not H265?
[00:02:44] <Skaface82> yeah h265 is supported, but i found 264 to work better
[00:02:47] <xb0o2> Ah
[00:03:04] <Skaface82> its software encoded

[00:04:24] <johnjay> i changed to testing in sources.list then ran 'sudo apt-get upgrade' instead of the other command. dist-upgrade or something
[00:04:42] <mlu> doing apt-get upgrade doesn't update your release
[00:04:46] <TJ-> johnjay: dist-upgrade will pull in new SOname library versions and new major-version packages
[00:05:05] <TJ-> johnjay: same as "apt full-upgrade"
[00:05:17] <Skaface82> i think they recommend you use apt upgrade before a dist-upgrade anyway dont they?
[00:05:17] <mlu> in fact, I generally do apt-get upgrade to pull new packages and only use dist-upgrade when I intended to upgrade the entire OS
[00:05:27] <mlu> yes, this -^
[00:05:40] <johnjay> you change your sources.list then run apt-get upgrade?

[00:06:35] <johnjay> i did it on accident
[00:06:58] <mlu> that's how you migrate from stable to testing, yes
[00:07:02] <johnjay> mlu: well i looked at some of the things it was installing. and it was the version from bookworm not bullseye
[00:07:23] <TJ-> dist-upgrade, because it can upgrade to new dependencies can also remove existing package (versions)

[00:09:18] <mlu> johnjay: it doesn't upgrade the stuff that needs to be moved as one piece

[03:01:44] <Skaface82> i would install something basic like ubuntu (something without a hugely customised desktop environment) and try installing KDE, and maybe something like xfce so you can see the differences between different desktop environments
[03:01:45] <rangersmyth> I have Kali running on a partition on my D Drive on my Windows Laptop, I boot into Kali and have Parrot OS as my send os on the D Drive, with win on c:
[03:01:59] <Skaface82> you can choose which one to use from the login manager screen

[05:47:44] <Shortstop> right, but I just need 'root' removed, even if its a group or an owner
[05:47:52] <pnbeast> Files and dirs have an owner, and a group.  You can change those with the commands "chown" and "chgrp".  There are also many other ways.
[05:48:28] <pnbeast> Shortstop, you can give up the idea of "removal".  Files and dirs always have an owner and a group.  You must change them to one that you prefer.

[11:13:28] <PaulFertser> Adding to that advice, it often helps to see the counters so that it would be visible which rule is getting triggered, for that use "-c" option of iptables.
[11:13:59] <PaulFertser> Also in current kernel it's possible that nft-based firewall is used, so worth checking "nft list ruleset" too.

[15:24:17] <phogg> that used to be an early-boot thing that has likely been taken over by systemd on most systems now
[15:24:20] <Gaboradon> It's not so much in trying to make it "proper" or "fix", not saying the filestructure is bugged or wrong, but it's sort of a hobby project I was thinking what could it be like if we developed linux FS today in 2021
[15:24:38] <phogg> I completely understand. It's a fun thing to toy with (I've done a bit myself)

[15:25:26] <phogg> Gaboradon: you would have to research what reads each file/dir and then get the source for that program and see to what extent it is a compile-time decisions vs. a runtime decision, and where it looks for its config
[15:25:29] <Gaboradon> Heh, I just watched some random Arch install guide and it mentioned /usr/share/zoneinfo config
[15:25:52] *** Joins: Fatal_Sushi (~quassel@ubuntu/member/mekaneck)
[15:26:12] <phogg> most everything is going to be a runtime decision with config in /etc (or some other well-known location) and then a fallback on the usual default value
[15:26:33] <phogg> the things that are more likely to be at fixed locations (compiled in that way) will be paths specified by POSIX and the like
[15:26:43] <Gaboradon> Coincidentially I thought to myself there's probably a better name for this to make it more obvious what it is about, I come from Windows but this also means I know all the bad sides of Windows and I'm not glued to it's philosophy, but some things I can't get used to in linux as well.

[17:00:01] <Budd> I managed to completely hang my USB bus by plugging in a presumably buggy USB device. The system complained that it failed to read the descriptor (error -110), and all my USB devices hung up. Unplugging the faulty device did not help, and I eventually had to reboot.
[17:00:14] <Budd> Is there a way to make my system resilient to such buggy devices?

[19:28:29] <maximilian4> hey, I want that my computer only connects to the internet with my VPN. What I did to ensure that is connecting to the VPN and afterwards deactivating the network interface from my original network (if that makes sense, I don't know if I used the terminology correctly.) I know there are better ways but would that be sufficient? Everytime I
[19:28:29] <maximilian4> disconnect from the VPN, the internet connection is instantly gone
[19:28:39] <Blondie101010> pingpongball:  I still don't *like* systemd, but I can tell you that it makes service control and monitoring so much easier
[19:29:52] <Blondie101010> at my previous job I made a simple script that would automatically identify faulty services, try to restart them conditionally and alert, without making specific tests per service
[19:29:58] <ayecee> maximilian4: it doesn't make sense. if you deactivate the network interface, then there's no way for the VPN traffic to reach the VPN endpoint.

Then when I'm connected to the VPN I do "ip r del" plus the line which starts with default. If I want to disconnect from the VPN and use my own network again I do "ip r add" plus the default line. Then it works again.
[19:37:19] <maximilian4> I'm a complete noob, my only goal was that there is no way I accidentally connect through my own IP-address to specific sites.

I tried to find a way that I don't need to do the ip r add and ip r del everytime I restart my computer or if I want to switch to my own network again. I found this: "ip r add  "ipOfVPN/32 via

So the solution I have right now works fine, I
