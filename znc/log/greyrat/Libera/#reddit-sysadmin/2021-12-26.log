[10:15:00] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Good for you. I feel unsafe walking through a crime-ridden area when it's pitch black out.
[10:15:37] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> And so I was trying to figure out if I should do something that could potentially lose job to feel safer on such a walk.

[10:17:13] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I live in a famously crime ridden area and go out every night
[10:17:34] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And I’ve never once been like “damn I wish I had a gun rn”

[10:17:46] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Good for you. I'm 5'5 and 100 pounds.
[10:18:26] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I mean I have a ccw and im glad I do but never in my life have I wanted for needed it
[10:18:30] <sd> 12<g​ibby> it isn't about size or weight, my man
[10:18:40] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And more often than not carrying is a huge liability
[10:18:59] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @gibby Just because one individual has done it successfully in a crime-ridden area, doesn't make _ME_ feel any safer.

[10:22:21] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> I'm not affiliated with any gangs, so the odds of a drive-by shooting happening to me specifically is basically nil.
[10:23:08] <sd> 12<g​ibby> yuken, I grew up in a really shit place, moved to somewhere barely better before going to college, went somewhere that was marginally better, then landed in a place with the worst of the worst. Never did I think "man I got to have a gun"
[10:23:23] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Awesome.
[10:23:33] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Ngl I know people get clapped here all the time but it’s almost always accidental or random. Having a weapon or not does not stop a stray from hitting your head
[10:23:50] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @NinjaStyle Sure, nothing I can do will prevent someone from running up behind me with a brick or hammer
[10:23:55] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> and slamming my skull into concrete.
[10:23:55] <sd> 12<g​ibby> when I mean "shit place" I mean on the top ten index for crime, specifically murder
[10:24:10] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> You can't stop that no matter how hard you try, outside of avoiding such an area in the first place.
[10:24:50] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Right do what’s the main threat you consider to exist, and where does carrying mitigate those
[10:24:59] <sd> 12<g​ibby> here's what we'll do, because this conversation is fucking as stupid as cryptic1's mom

[10:25:29] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And imo my threat model only includes situations where I need a gun when I’m planning on getting into a sketchy situation. Which is why I have a CCW

[22:11:27] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I cannot bypass 2FA in any other way
[22:13:39] <XV8> That's a pretty standard recovery procedure from what I've experienced in the past. I've once locked myself out of my own Azure tenant (lab, not prod) with a bad conditional access policy and the only wait for them to reset the access was through verification of my identity.
[22:13:55] <XV8> the only way*
[22:14:32] <XV8> But I can see how there would be no single "owner" in a large org and you would ultimately be screwed unless the company can prove some other way they are the owners of the account.

[22:42:16] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i know
[22:42:19] <mistiry> no you dont
[22:42:24] <mistiry> because you keep fucking saying it
[22:42:32] <mistiry> the nameservers dont matter
[22:42:33] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i know i'm saying it?
[22:42:36] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> you know how I know?
[22:42:39] <mistiry> the fact that the domain is your name doesnt matter
[22:42:48] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes
[22:42:50] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> that's correct
[22:42:53] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> keep going
[22:43:26] <mistiry> so stop bringing it up 
[22:43:40] <mistiry> nobody cares
[22:43:46] <mistiry> if you dont like how namecheap does it
[22:43:48] <mistiry> move on from them
[22:43:49] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i mean
[22:43:50] <mistiry> ez
[22:43:55] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> it's not even that
[22:44:17] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> the problem has been solved... so we can just drop the whole conversation right now
[22:44:17] <mistiry> your initial complaint was that namecheap was requiring a photo ID to prove domain ownership, to an account you admitted you dont technically own
[22:44:36] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> right and fast forward half an hour, the issue has been solved
[22:44:36] <mistiry> you keep bringing up shit like "the nameserver are under my control" 
[22:44:43] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> ok
[22:44:48] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> it's now 2:14 PM
[22:44:55] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> the issue is no longer an issue
[22:44:59] <mistiry> yes and i walked away from this and then came back to another tag from you
[22:45:11] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I know?
[22:45:16] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> because I pinged you
[22:45:33] <mistiry> right. so dont sit there asking me to move on from the conversation that YOU tagged me back into
[22:45:37] <CptLuxx> so to close this discussion

[22:45:44] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> sure

[22:46:03] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> so long as you can prove it
[22:46:33] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I can own google.com if I wanted to
[22:46:49] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I just need to be able to prove it, which I can't, and so I don't own that
[22:46:51] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> simple
[22:53:18] <sd> 09<H​aise> jfc
