[14:40:31] <biberu> xeno: someone approached me about an f# position
[14:41:19] <biberu> ... but it was the same one i considered applying for earlier so it doesn't affect the numbers ^^
[15:26:05] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Did you check out Trustbit yet?
[15:26:24] <MatthiasVance> I probably mentioned that before
[15:26:57] <MatthiasVance> If you want to come do more F# (we have teams with other languages and disciplines too) you're more than welcome :D
[15:29:34] <biberu> MatthiasVance: hopefully it'll be a while before i look for anything new :)
[15:29:56] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Yeah I was wondering about that xD
[15:30:10] <MatthiasVance> Not sure how much earlier was "earlier"
[15:30:14] <MatthiasVance> *wasn't
[15:49:31] <biberu> MatthiasVance: several months :)
