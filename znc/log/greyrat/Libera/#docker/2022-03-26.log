[01:03:53] <lantech19446> i missed the docker hub part
[01:07:10] <programmerq> what do you mean by "inactive" like, you deleted it in the docker hub gui? yeah, you'd have to push it again.
[01:07:30] <programmerq> if the blobs haven't been garbage collected, you may not need to push everything if the checksum is the same for some of the layers.

[04:56:55] <gurki> is it a reasonable idea to move a bunch of docker containers by just copying the underlying file system or will this backfire?
[04:57:10] <gurki> i will ofc ensure that paths (including the paths of volumes) will be persistent
[04:57:48] <gurki> i would prefer a docker --compress-all-containers-and-take-volumes-with-you for an easier move but the options i looked at thus far did not quite provide that
[04:58:33] <gurki> some people mentioned that docker versions might be incompatible, is there an easy way to check which docker versions play along nicely?

[18:06:05] <ssahin> Hello everyone.
[18:07:19] <ssahin> I'm currently trying to host a self-hosted version of Gitlab CE, on an Ubuntu Server instance. I'm using Docker Compose, and the container launchs successfully, but when I try to connect to the container's exposed ports by connecting to localhost:8081, I can't establish a connection.
[18:07:45] <ssahin> Although I can successfully connect to the local docker container's IP, acquired with docker inspect.
[18:08:56] <ssahin> 172.19.0.2, to be exact. I think that the exact IP has no use in troubleshooting, but I'm mentioning it because I think I am trying to connect to the container's IP, please correct me if I am wrong.
[18:09:57] <ikke> ssahin: what does `docker-compose ps` return?
[18:10:12] <ssahin> gitlab-docker-compose-web-1   "/assets/wrapper"   web                 running (healthy)   0.0.0.0:221->22/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8081->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, :::221->22/tcp, :::8081->80/tcp, :::443->443/tcp

[18:11:16] <ssahin> I think so.,
[18:11:29] *** Joins: iomari891 (~iomari891@197.210.53.228)
[18:11:30] <ikke> yeah, you cannot connect to 0.0.0.0
[18:11:37] <ikke> that just means it's listening on all IPs
[18:12:10] <ikke> Did you disable dockers iptables integration, or did you overwrite it?
[18:12:15] <ssahin> I thought I could connect to 0.0.0.0 and it would direct to one of the ips.
[18:12:24] <ssahin> I haven't messed with the iptables integration.
[18:12:57] <ssahin> Interesting enough I can successfully connect to the service with localhost or 0.0.0.0 or one of the IPs when I directly run the container, not by docker-compose

[18:24:53] <tabakhase> ssahin given you used the word "instance" it sound like you got more of those? - then by all my docker love, pls just use omnibus via apt :P
[18:26:10] <tabakhase> gitlab has so many moving parts, unless you go full-helm-chart or there like its a fight in docker...

[18:33:07] <tabakhase> well then it ofc. depends on deployment-size and users/usecase too sure :P
[18:35:28] <tabakhase> that said, if its in any sorta professional, the extra 5$/month to give it its very own vps somewhere is usually very worth.... - "its not prod" so often gitlab&co gets setup as single instance - but its much more about "what actually happens when its down" - not beeing able to deploy some emergency fix for something else to your real prod makes your gitlab just as important as prod :P
[18:36:01] <tabakhase> for your homelab / chruch / youthclub tho? - yea then the fat-container docker version may be just fine... :D

[18:40:53] <tabakhase> but other than that the compose shuld do just fine - and the "cant reach 0000 thing" you wrote was basically just user error so i assuem you figured this out by now?
[18:41:33] <ssahin> Running it with the docker command works, but docker-compose won't work, for some reason...
[18:42:02] <ssahin> Although I can connect to the internal container IP (172.19.0.2) successfully.
[18:43:07] <tabakhase> gotta define what doesnt work means - supposedly it started correctly and is up if you can spy in with docker0-interface
[18:44:06] <tabakhase> so from where you are trying todo what and what does it tell?   ((and here a "conenction refused" is very different to a "connection timed out" whats very different to "hot not found" -- all of those my mum would describe as "doesnt work" - but shell say "doesnt work" as well when the pc isnt plugged in ;-)
[18:45:36] <ssahin> I believe it's connection refused.
[18:45:48] <ssahin> Yes, it is.

[18:48:36] <tabakhase> "docker ps" to verify you have ports mapped -- "iptables-save" to verify docker setup needed forwarding into the container -- if both checks out, things should be just fine and "you may be trying to hit the wrong thing?"
[18:48:51] <ssahin> Ports are mapped.
[18:49:57] <ssahin> I ran 'iptables-save` with root, and checked but nothing changed. Firefox can't establish a connection and elinks says connection is reset by peer.
[18:50:35] <tabakhase> after that its pretty much tcpdump to verify your request even gets to the host  (whats unlinkely to be broken when youre sshed into that very same server i guess :D)
[18:50:53] <ssahin> Oh wait, elinks began to show "Error reading from socket", so we're getting somewhere?
[18:51:49] <tabakhase> anything further only works with actual data, so YOUR compose, YOUR command, YOUR "docker ps" on a nopaste and so on, not gitlabs examples --- cause you wouldnt be the first to mixup internal&external ports either for example ;-)
[18:52:08] <ssahin> OK, hang on a second, please.

[18:58:09] <ssahin> and also I don't have any .env files, and you're right, maybe I should make one...

[19:07:00] <tabakhase> key is rly what you are even trying to connect to :P -- no offense, but all sorta people show up here, so well never know if you are "trying to hit localhost:80" on another pc, or try curling some lan-ip over 3 different VPNs - so a pasted "curl https://12.35.*.*:80 with an errormessage" can help a lot there ;-)
[19:09:06] <tabakhase> and then that curl from the docker host to itself, and from a remote - if remote then fails but local works, back to the top to verify your packets even make it to your host - you may have some other firewall inbetween/above you or so...
[19:10:06] <ssahin> I'm directly connecting to that domain.
[19:11:34] <tabakhase> at least the hostname used in there does not resolve
[19:12:07] <ssahin> The standalone docker works when I deploy the container with sudo, so I will try to deploy the compose with sudo too.
[19:13:09] <tabakhase> sudo makes no difference (unless you somehow super messed up and have two docker daemons running or so :D) -- "docker-daemon" is who does things, the sudo is "about allowing your user to talk to it by api" so it shouldnt make any difference

[19:14:37] <tabakhase> also "docker run" and "docker-compose" use that very same API on the docker-daemon to create those things, so if one works, the other should just as fine rly
[19:14:41] <ssahin> So I thought, but elinks not being able to read from the socket is interesting.
[19:16:15] <ssahin> Which was when connecting to 0.0.0.0:8081, when I try to connect to the domain it refuses the connection, though the container's IP works fine yet again.
[19:18:05] *** Joins: hojasuelta (~hojasuelt@67-198-118-247.dyn.grandenetworks.net)
[19:19:10] <ssahin> So when I curl localhost and 0.0.0.0's relevant ports (8081), it says Recv failure: Connection reset by peer, but when I curl the external IP, it says "Failed to connect to IP port 8081: Connection refused"
[19:24:01] *** Joins: gchound (~gchound@user/gchound)
[19:24:16] <tabakhase> that sounds like forwarding is broken in general then...
[19:25:54] <ssahin> Currently running docker-compose with no -d to see if it throws up any error.
[19:26:13] <ssahin> Though I feel like I'll revert to using standalone docker in the meanwhile, as it looks like this problem can't be solved yet.
[19:26:30] <ssahin> Nope, no errors.
[19:27:45] <tabakhase> fire up some simple `docker run --rm -it -p 8123:80 nginx`  and hit it with a `curl localhost:8123` (from a second terminal, or add "-d" in the run) - and a curl from some remote - just to remove "gitlab" from this...
[19:28:25] <ssahin> I currently have a native nginx and it works.
[19:28:48] <tabakhase> and uhm, also, try `curl 127.0.0.1:8123`  to force v4....
[19:29:06] <ssahin> Curling from a remote also works.
[19:29:30] <ssahin> v4 also works in both the server and the remote

[19:30:08] <tabakhase> ya now talking of works to your native nginx? - or the docker command i gave you? cause native we dont care
[19:30:09] <ssahin> Containers also work.
[19:30:17] <ssahin> Just tested, container nginx works too.
[19:32:44] <tabakhase> if nginx docker works, and gitlab docker doesnt thats now up to  gitlab.... -- where you say "works via containerIP" - but also NOT via the local forward? - this is a bit confusing... and smells like your "works with container IP" test was invalid...
[19:33:27] <ssahin> elinks 172.19.0.2:8081`
[19:33:29] <ssahin> works
[19:33:33] <tabakhase> rememeber how i said "many components"? ;-) there are like 3 or more http-endpoints in that "fat container".. so you beeing able to lan-hack one of em may not mean shit

[19:34:41] <tabakhase> "172.19.0.2:8081" doesnt make sense in any constellation  --- if "172.19.0.2" is the docker-internal IP, it wouldnt know/care about your "custom 8081 port", containers dont change ports things run on the publishing step does that
[19:36:41] <tabakhase> if you somehow changed what the container runs on, youd need to reflect that in the "right side" of the publish - but usually noone & nothing does this except some rare exceptions
[19:37:14] <tabakhase> maybe verify with a netstat/ss in the container what things are actually bound too....

[19:39:04] <tabakhase> if your external-url config forced that gitlab-nginx to change its port that may be all there is to it... - flip 8081:80 to 8081:8081 and fine is...
[19:39:20] *** Joins: hojasuelta (~hojasuelt@67-198-118-247.dyn.grandenetworks.net)

[19:39:26] <ssahin> let me check
[19:39:52] <ssahin> when I run netstat in the container I get the port 8081 instead of 80... you're probably correct.
[19:40:04] <tabakhase> (also, "if there is no netstat in this container" -> https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot )

[19:43:46] <ssahin> tabakhase it works.
[19:44:13] <tabakhase> well there docs certainly dont say that it changes ports, in fact they do say the very opposite... "external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com:8929' + '8929:80'" they have in that doc... - that said, on omnibus that very external_url variable does indeed setup the nginx (as its also used for the http/httpS switch) -- so wonder if the docs are wrong, or they messed up there image xD
[19:44:32] <ssahin> thanks for helping me learn.
[19:47:07] <tabakhase> what an obscure issue to run into :F -- in the end, a very simple almost common error, but having it produced from such a "reputable image and documentation" totally throws this off...
[19:48:45] <ssahin> Yep, would totally not expect this to happen from GitLab.
[19:48:52] <ssahin> Maybe we should file an issue or something, I don't know.
