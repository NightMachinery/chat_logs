[18:33:28] <Activ8> lol i like this one
[18:34:31] <xnaas> personally, my voicemail used to be an incredibly well-time "Hello? [pause] Yeah."
[18:34:44] <xnaas> It got everyone every time â€” I'd get so many angry voicemails
[18:34:46] <Activ8> I like this one lol

[18:34:51] <xnaas> and when I answered legit, no one would believe it's me
[18:34:52] <Activ8> saw wanna play a game 
[19:26:28] <bookworm> >some fools disable formatting... some of those just don't feel like your pointlessly rainbow colored message is that important to stand put
[19:26:32] <bookworm> out*
[19:31:44] <xnaas> Of course, missing the formatting, you don't see that that was a simple spoiler message for them to test with. :)
[20:02:10] <bookworm> I mean if it were up to me we'd have +c anyhow
[20:06:35] <xnaas> ðŸ¤®
