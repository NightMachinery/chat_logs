[00:14:04] <Slade> ljharb, oh. do their employees get to vote?  i thought ecma sold voting rights memberships
[00:14:22] <ljharb> Slade: employees don'
[00:14:28] <ljharb> don't get to vote on technical issues, no
[00:14:32] <ljharb> Slade: and "pay to play" is not "selling voting rights"
[00:15:02] <ljharb> Slade: paying ecma dues entitles you to participate in TCs, and potentially vote in the General Assembly (depending on your membership tier)
[00:15:19] <ljharb> ftr, tier-based dues and privileges are how every single consortium and standards body usually works
[00:16:11] <Slade> ljharb, oh, i wasnt judging the mechanic. i think ECMA is setup more intelligently than ISO.  but somehow all these orgs need copious amounts of money

[08:24:13] <pavonia> When drawing on a canvas with 2D context, how do you handle situations where only some elements need to be changed but the rest of the (possibly very complex) drawing stay the same?

[08:32:22] <Maxdamantus> pavonia: if that's useful, you'd usually think in terms of "invalidating" certain regions (usually rectangles) of the canvas.
[08:32:44] <Maxdamantus> pavonia: and then your draw operation will be called with the geometry of the invalidated region.
[08:33:49] <Maxdamantus> pavonia: and you might have some logic that just maintains a small number (possibly 1) of invalidated regions. Two invalid regions can be merged into one by taking the minimum/maximum points of each.
[08:34:26] <pavonia> theskillwithin: Yeah, but say you want to remove one of those line segments. You'd have to redraw the whole lines then. I somehow want to store the current drawing
[08:34:56] <Maxdamantus> pavonia: the current drawing will persist unless you clear it somehow.
[08:35:14] <Maxdamantus> so you can just draw the changed parts on top.
[08:38:08] <Maxdamantus> Depending on what you're doing, you might find that it can be faster to just redraw the entire thing.

[08:46:48] <Maxdamantus> pavonia: sure, so use `clearRect` on the invalid region, then redraw it.
[08:47:24] <Maxdamantus> pavonia: if rounding errors at the edge of the invalid region are a concern, set a pixel-precise clip beforehand.
[08:48:13] <pavonia> That means I need to keep track of what elements need to be redrawn?
[08:49:28] <Maxdamantus> You'll want to keep track of what *region* needs to be redrawn, not what elements.
[08:50:17] <Maxdamantus> since you generally don't know how to undo the drawing of a particular element (it might overlap with another), so you should just redraw a certain selection of pixels.
[08:51:03] <Maxdamantus> When you know that only a particular region needs to be drawn, you can ignore elements outside of that region in your draw function.

[08:51:52] <silly> velix, morning
[08:51:53] <pavonia> Well, but that means I need to knwo what elements are in- and outside of that region
[08:52:04] <Maxdamantus> Yes.
[08:52:19] <Maxdamantus> You figure that out when drawing.
[08:52:25] <pavonia> Nah, this is way too complicated
[08:52:58] <Maxdamantus> It's how things work.
[08:53:30] <Maxdamantus> Either you can do this yourself, or you can use a "scene graph" system that does it for you (SVG effectively does that), or you can just redraw everything each time.
[08:53:52] <Maxdamantus> the "redraw everything" approach is actually often fine.
[08:55:00] <Maxdamantus> People are usually afraid of it at first because they're concerned about throwing away already computed information, but in reality you save on the computations involved in these bounding box tests.
[08:56:03] <Maxdamantus> and also, if you need to support some sort of zoom, the invalidation strategy won't work through that anyway, so you'll just accept the fact that you have to draw everything every frame.
[08:59:03] <Maxdamantus> actually, the main thing you'd save on is not maintaining a big scene graph in memory.
[09:04:19] <Maxdamantus> When doing the "redraw everything" approach, you just want to make sure your draw functions involve very few allocations, preferably none.
[09:05:35] <pavonia> Allocations of what kind?
[09:05:53] <Maxdamantus> of objects.

[15:56:15] <jokoon> hey hey hey, what about my jsfiddle guys, stop talking genitalia
[15:56:22] <hassoon> silly: ah meh
[15:56:26] <nr0q_radio> :facepalm: I'm the dev-ops / PM of an open source project and if something is taking that long, I usually ask if there's some npm or other module that'll already does half of what we're trying to do
[15:56:26] <OnkelTem> webpack question: do you use two different webpack configs for dev and prod or just one with if-s?
[15:56:59] <hassoon> silly: if the guy is the project manager himself..and if he is confident and able to do things in vanilla js, which is a respectable attitude, then i'd agree with him
[15:57:19] <OnkelTem> What is the better option in the sense of readability and DRY?
[15:57:20] <hassoon> silly: otherwise it's your problem for not liking vanilla javascript :D
[15:57:36] <silly> i like vanilla
[15:57:41] <hassoon> silly: ah not you, i mean velix
[15:57:42] <nr0q_radio> I mean I guess depends on what the product is and if there's any time constraints
[15:57:43] <silly> but... use react
[15:57:45] <hassoon> you guys are simlar wth
[15:57:50] <hassoon> silly: m'h i'd use angukar

[15:57:59] <silly> lol
[15:58:08] <silly> not in #javascript
[15:58:09] <hassoon> angular is like kde, react is like ... gnome

[15:58:44] <nr0q_radio> being the project I'm on is donation based, the longer between releases, the smaller the donation kiddie gets

[23:29:45] <c4017> unicode has a lot of characters that look similar to english letters. Is there a good way to check if two strings 'look' the same even if they use alternate characters? Not looking for perfection, just something that catches most cases
[23:30:20] <bomb> use an ocr

[23:33:51] <c4017> Well I guess I don't care if they 'look' the same, just that they use an alternate charater. Basically I want a fuzzy match where 'a', '⍺', etc. all mathc as 'a'

[23:35:02] <ThePendulum> there are lookup tables for that stuff
[23:35:09] <ThePendulum> of course they have their cons

[23:35:24] <Alexendoo> c4017: unicode calls those confusables, there's probably a lib for it
[23:35:52] <c4017> yes, I'm trying to find a lookuptable or library for it. I will look up confusables

[23:38:13] <c4017> and someone made a lib out of it https://www.npmjs.com/package/unicode-confusables

[23:55:42] <AJTJ> does the JS .find() method do a binary search?
[23:55:59] <Alexendoo> AJTJ: no
[23:56:13] <AJTJ> Alexendoo:
[23:56:19] <AJTJ> what kind of algo does it use?
[23:56:54] <Alexendoo> It just visits every element in order
[23:57:12] <AJTJ> Alexendoo: that's really innefficient
[23:57:21] <AJTJ> is there a way to optimize the method?
[23:57:29] <AJTJ> without writing your own binary search
[23:57:50] <AJTJ> are there more efficient search algorithms?
[23:57:58] <AJTJ> in built-in methods?
[23:58:04] <pavonia> Binary search only works if you have some kind of ordering, which is not true in general

[23:58:19] <AJTJ> pavonia: this is true, but I do have a sorted array
[23:58:32] <Alexendoo> There's no built in binary search
[23:59:41] <AJTJ> Here's a question, would it be faster to sort an array and then perform a binary search on it? Or would it be faster to simply use the .find method?
[23:59:49] <AJTJ> I have a feeling it is the former
[23:59:57] <Alexendoo> It is far faster to just search it
