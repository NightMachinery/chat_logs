[04:10:37] <radix0> signofzeta, What are the actual symptoms you are experiencing? Are the hotmail/live/msn/outlook mailboxes not receiving mail but other services like yahoo and gmail are? Are your emails going to quarantines in the MS "public mailbox" infra or are they being outright being not delivered? Do DMARC reports indicate anything?
[04:12:27] <signofzeta> radix0: a bounceback.  "Unfortunately, messages from [IPv4_ADDRESS_HERE] weren't sent. Please contact your Internet service provider since part of their network is on our block list (S3150)."
[04:12:40] <signofzeta> Microsoft consumer is blocking email from this Microsoft Azure IP.
[04:12:54] <signofzeta> I've gotten through this before, but I'm having a colossal brain fart right now.

[04:20:02] <radix0> Dumb question kinda unrelated to your problem, signofzeta. You mentioned DKIM is working. I thought on-prem exch didn't allow for outbound DKIM signing?
[04:20:19] <signofzeta> radix0: It doesn't, but there's a great third-party app for it.

[04:21:12] <signofzeta> Only downside: Exchange updates typically require this app to be updated, and that's not good these days.  But I love the app anyway.

[05:46:56] <Church> xe0n: I mean technically an option heh
[05:47:04] <signofzeta> No, but I had a co-worker earlier today have trouble connecting to our Cloudflare proxy (which uses LE).
[05:47:10] <xe0n> yeah its a silly option
[05:47:16] <csws> Church, my public facing certs appear to be cross signed so no issues there but opnsense is throwing errors when checking for updates and whatnot lol
[05:47:16] <Church> xe0n: The real answer is, openSSL fix your shit
[05:47:20] <signofzeta> Only him, though.  No one else./
[05:47:23] <csws> and people are reporting acme client issues on their github
[05:47:34] <Church> Oh boy, good thing I'm good till dec
[05:47:50] <Church> Might have issues with clients who do IOT stuff and use us however.
[05:47:54] <Church> So that's... fun
[05:48:15] <signofzeta> On downlevel clients that *can* be updated, import the "new" ISRG X1 cert.  Problem solved.
[05:48:22] <Hunterkll> In fact i recall a few situations vaugely where the fix was to *delete* ALL GCs and recreate 
[05:48:23] <Hunterkll> lol
[05:48:32] <signofzeta> Windows XP? Maybe you can do that? IDK.
[05:48:36] <csws> idk if it was legit but someone was talking about a proposal where you store fingerprints or something in DNS records and basically self sign
[05:48:38] <csws> honestly that would be nice lol
[05:48:44] <Church> csws: Using openSSL 1.x in opnsense?
[05:48:44] <csws> but you have to have DNSSEC
[05:48:47] <Church> Heh maybe
[05:48:49] <csws> Church, yeah not libre
[05:48:52] <signofzeta> csws: DANE! 
[05:48:57] <Church> The issue of course is we're basically an API
[05:49:07] <signofzeta> Dns-based Authentication of Named Entities!
[05:49:08] <Church> So we can't force our customers to do shit for the most part lol

[05:49:24] <Church> Course it may not even be this, they may have just bungled some stuff

[05:49:27] <xe0n> nice
[05:49:44] <csws> nice
[05:50:22] <signofzeta> DANE hasn't caught on due to DNSSEC, but it's getting more traction in the SMTP+TLS sphere than HTTPS where it should do the most good.
[05:50:58] <csws> yeah SMTP is a disaster with TLS right now

[10:18:58] <catbeard> age of their account, or the user's human age?

[12:23:36] <xe0n> yup!

[12:23:42] <xe0n> i was supposed to go to northshore tonight for camping

[12:23:43] <xe0n> glad i aint
[12:23:43] <xe0n> lol
[12:24:26] <DrZak> ok o365 ppl - if i have AD FS (and not PTA/PHS and seamless sso) - i can, if i want to, store the login / password in the credential manager as generic credentials, right? And if the password changes due to domain policies, outlook will simply say - type in your password, correct?
[12:24:56] <DrZak> its' like if you stored credentials to a web page in a pwd manager and then after X time changed it - you still needto change it in your pwd manager
[12:25:40] <csws> it'll only save username/password if you're using basic auth
[12:26:06] <csws> otherwise it stores a token and yeah, that token gets expired if the password changes, thereby prompting the user
[12:26:16] <BWMerlin> Had hail here for two days in a row now
[12:26:22] <csws> you can also force that token to expire from the AAD user page
[12:26:33] <csws> I think it's 'revoke sessions' or something like that
[12:27:20] <csws> DrZak, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/refresh-tokens
[12:28:29] <csws> you really shouldn't need to fiddle or even worry about credential manager at this point
[12:28:32] <ender> ‚Ä¶how the hell do you convert VLSC login from MS to work account? Every time I click "Sign in with your work account" it just reloads the page (regardless of which browser I'm using, and private window doesn't help either)
[12:30:28] <DrZak> aaah
[12:30:40] <DrZak> so if basic auth -> they need to type it in there
[12:30:55] <csws> yeah basic auth they get prompted with the old fashioned username/password prompt
[12:30:58] <csws> modern auth they get your ADFS page
[12:31:41] <DrZak> and the token gets refreshed
[12:31:46] <DrZak> oki!
[12:31:47] <csws> welllll
[12:31:58] <csws> they get an access token and a refresh token I think
[12:31:58] <DrZak> if they authenticate correctly
[12:32:02] <csws> and then they use the refresh to get new access tokens
[12:32:08] <csws> and when you revoke.. the refresh token no longer works and they're kicked out
[12:32:12] <DrZak> mhm
[12:32:27] <csws> basic auth it just sends the username and password in the HTTP headers lol
[12:32:40] <DrZak> oki, i keep getting this question about once in 1,5 years
[12:32:46] <DrZak> and always forget the answer
[12:33:00] <Oliber> ender: did you try IE? :S

[13:34:29] <macinsight> So, both technically and legally (because procedures and shit), there isn't really a way to get the files from one side to the other without breaking some procedures and probably getting yelled at by corpIT.
[13:34:37] <sd> 10<S‚Äãerenity> I think they are taking the "behind 7 proxies" too far if they are proxied behind two msps
[13:35:56] <macinsight> Technically it's THREE proxies, because we have our own internal IT team, which is just 2 dudes making 80k eur a year to push tickets from us to MSP#1, who then pushes them to #2, who then pushes it to CorpIT.
[13:36:27] <macinsight> And fucking beware if you go to MSP #1 without first going through our internal IT.
[13:37:40] <macinsight> And depending on the ticket raised, Hardware installations etc get pushed from CorpIT to MSP THREE.
[13:38:00] <macinsight> So, yeah... You can imagine how fucking difficult it is to get any admin work done here.
[13:38:09] <macinsight> Or any work at all
[13:39:44] <macinsight> Oh, yeah, our MGW also blocks audio/video, because they *could* be deemed in vialoation of copyright. This shit's worse than youtubes DCMA algo!
[13:40:38] <Activ8> just follow the rules if it's not done and you contacted the people who need to do the job it's not your fault

[13:41:30] <macinsight> How likely is it that the process is ever getting changed?
[13:41:42] <Activ8> not likely but then it's not your fault

[13:43:38] <macinsight> Yeah, with small MSPs, getting things up the chain *usually* resolves an issue.
[13:44:05] <Activ8> I'm not loosing sleep over some fucker elses problem lol not a chance
[13:44:47] <macinsight> With our setup? Bahahahaharrrr... Getting something up the chain to get somehting fixed requires permit A38...
[13:45:02] <Activ8> really? well then that's not your problem :)
[13:45:33] <macinsight> Try getting someone that says something different apart from "Not my problem" here, and you're in for a long search.
[13:46:19] <macinsight> For example, we had a new hire start today. The ticket to patch his network has been open for the last months.
[13:46:24] <macinsight> month*
[13:46:32] <Activ8> I wouldn't ever work somewhere where it's difficult to work like that
[13:46:36] <Activ8> not a chance
[13:47:21] <macinsight> Don't work in gov, then. Job's stable, pay's good, but... Anything with IT, where you don't have the luxury of being able to circumvent that shit 'cause you got your own separate network? Gooood luck.
[13:47:30] <Activ8> and others wonder why people get annoyed working in environments like that, what a piss place to work
[13:48:03] <macinsight> Ah, it usually is good. I'd chat with corpIT admins during smoke breacks, but they're all WFH'ing for the last year.
[13:48:58] <macinsight> The good thing is: Most stuff can be procured through OUR depts MSP (An entirely different company, LOL, so MSP#4), who used to manage the network I'm admin'ing now beforehand.

[13:50:10] <macinsight> We got our own machines, own switches, own everything, as everything requires physical separation from our corp network, and my depts MSP is usually quick to deliver requested stuff. So, it's not *that* bad, as we can easily work around it in most cases.
[13:50:21] <macinsight> The 2% where we can't is... difficult, though.

[14:00:01] <macinsight> Do you wanna know why we're making our life harder than it has to be by being airgapped?
[14:00:15] <macinsight> Because that network is still running... Hold on to something, please...

[14:02:32] <Activ8> you won't need to patch it if your behind a big ass firewall and proxy servers
[14:02:52] <Activ8> you can't even get html emails right? lol 
[14:03:06] <macinsight> I mean, why would they, we're paying them to manage the servers running the light controllers, not anything else. Our predecessor company (The actual gov entitiy who owned the network before we took over) never specified that anything SHOULD be patched.
[14:03:09] <Activ8> infact scrap emails just get rid of it lol
[14:03:26] <Activ8> exactly!
[14:03:37] <Activ8> we do nothing on our customers network unless a ticket comes in
