[05:06:02] <ZeroDay> godSend23: RFID is a more of a physical system, so to mess with that you'd probably need a hardware lab to start with
[05:06:19] <ZeroDay> And research into how those protocols work

[05:50:09] <soulisson> ZeroDay, I'm going to check
[05:50:43] <ttys000> hey guys
[05:50:50] <ttys000> so about 2 months ago, or so...
[05:51:04] <ttys000> i came into this channel and talked about setting up some scripts that would automatically report abuse
[05:51:24] <ttys000> by looking up the arn, and the whois from that and sending emails, with abuse reports.
[05:51:31] <wirez> what can a dev earn just starting out in a security focus?
[05:51:37] <ttys000> so here's an update on that.
[05:51:54] *** Joins: yuckey2d0 (~yuckey2d@209.181.233.16)
[05:51:55] <ttys000> one big thing that i've learned is that mostly i am attacked by one large botnet
[05:52:01] <soulisson> ZeroDay, no, it seems it recognizes properly the hash
[05:52:12] <ttys000> its all the same guy, who has compromised hundreds of thousands of hosts.
[05:52:25] <ttys000> i can tell, because he's lazy and uses the same outdated user agent for all the attacks.
[05:52:38] <ttys000> its very rare, and also very outdated, firefox 62 for linux.
[05:52:58] <ttys000> so anyway, i guess he figured me out last night.
[05:53:05] <ttys000> he's very VERY angry i think.
[05:53:08] <wirez> add to a filter list as far upstream as you go?
[05:53:14] <wirez> he prolly got aids
[05:53:23] <soulisson> wirez, what kind of job are you looking for?
[05:53:25] <ttys000> last night i got approximately 75,000 brand new hosts attacking me.
[05:53:36] <ZeroDay> Lol
[05:53:43] <ttys000> the volume of the attacks is much much higher than everything so far.
[05:53:47] <wirez> soulisson: wanna heavily focus into sec after decade plus coding
[05:54:08] <soulisson> wirez, do you want to switch to a security job?
[05:54:10] <ttys000> i woke up to an inbox of 10,000 or so email replies to my abuse filings.
[05:54:10] <wirez> you do anything to make this guy mad?
[05:54:30] <ttys000> i report all his IPs
[05:54:34] <wirez> soulisson: as deep into sec as i can go, however much that uses my coding bg
[05:54:36] <ttys000> they get taken down.
[05:54:59] <circuitbone> The better lads buy/auction new ip and abuse them before you can swat them down.

[05:55:47] <AskerX> Hi there people!
[05:55:58] <wirez> what you think i could earn starting out in code audit or web app pen testing?

[05:56:28] <soulisson> wirez, no idea. I don't know where you live
[05:56:33] <wirez> you should start blogging about your war with this guy. way better than whatever garbage wired or nyt puts out
[05:56:41] <AskerX> Is there such a thing as irreversible counter? Something that if it is incremented by one there is no way to reverse it? I need it for a kind of a home security project.
[05:56:45] <wirez> usa dump
[05:56:52] <ZeroDay> soulisson, you could check github to see if there's an updated version of that script? Or maybe the key is broke somehow?

[05:59:26] <soulisson> wirez, I'm not sure what kind of tips you're looking for. If you're already a good dev, you shouldn't have too much problem learning about security concepts, vulnerabilities, ... other than that, choose wisely your company, some of them demand too much

[05:59:34] <AskerX> wirez well you see lets say there is a door that I want to lock and leave the house, now I can use a security camera or automated sms messaging and such, but what if it gets hacked or the sms (SIM) company does funny stuff, but I was thinking that if there is something like an irreversible counter, every day I leave the house it is incremented by
[05:59:35] <AskerX> one and I simply can keep count, and when I return if the numbers don't matchup  there has been an entery
[05:59:38] <AskerX> something like that

[06:01:00] <wirez> AskerX: ok i'd make a tiny pc appliance that's locked down and listens only to 2 api messages, increment and read
[06:01:05] <soulisson> wirez, some might disagree but having a cert could help you with HR
[06:01:17] <wirez> if nothing else it's tamper evident
[06:01:43] <AskerX> wirez but PC can be altered if there is physical access to it though, at the very least the content of ram can be altered
[06:01:51] <AskerX> it would negate the point
[06:01:56] <wirez> soulisson: im definitely not cut out for places with an HR thing. more like meet for a drink, talk, do stuff, cycle a couple more times then hire
[06:02:23] <wirez> is the whole sec field formal and corporate?
[06:03:09] <wirez> AskerX: make key exchange part of api
[06:03:59] <ZeroDay> wirez, lol no take a look at Def Con
[06:04:11] <AskerX> wirez aaah , I see, sort of like if the keys match up the content is trustable
[06:04:22] <wirez> ZeroDay: what about fbi agents larping as smart ppl?
[06:04:29] <soulisson> wirez, no idea, it depends on the company and its "culture". Some are less formal than others but in my case all the interviews I did were formal with the usual bullsh*t questions, ...
[06:04:34] <wirez> AskerX: ya more or less
[06:04:48] <wirez> soulisson: ok ty will be interesting
[06:04:54] <AskerX> wirez is there really no irreversible counter though?
[06:05:16] <wirez> well, to what size number
[06:05:29] <wirez> if you wanna account for roll you gotta integrate that into your api
[06:05:35] <wirez> then get into time and stuff
[06:06:12] * AskerX thinks now that with key exchange now I might have some kind of irreversible more like trustable counter hmmmm 
[06:06:22] <wirez> something you gotta face is nothing is certain it's just how weak can you tolerate. even bit flows in ur circuitry

[06:08:27] <AskerX> or is that too much?!

[06:10:08] <wirez> ZeroDay: underhanded != smart
[06:10:26] <AskerX> mats1 append only data structures still need ram, ram can be poked and altered electromagnetic radiation, hacking and such
[06:10:28] <wirez> anyone can be a piece of shit liar and deceive dumb ppl
[06:10:56] <mats1> you really think someone's going to apply a side channel attack to defeat your security system?

[06:11:35] * AskerX is a very honest person
[06:11:39] <mats1> that requires context, its not a 'hurr durr im in teh rams ill flip these rows and your box belong to me'
[06:12:20] <mats1> install a reasonable os like openbsd and sqlite, you're 80% of the way there
[06:12:48] <AskerX> mats1 yes, surely not like that, but lets say my setup is to watch a door, when I am not physically there, so all I got is a bunch of electronics and a data delivery method, a hole or bug in there = game over!

[23:24:06] <Apachez> define "physical security key"?
[23:24:55] <greg84> plike a usb stick with cryptographic keys inside.

[23:28:05] <greg84> E.g on the OS is a secure software which have private or public key encrypted with some algorithm. Which recognize the usb key inserted and share the cryptographic keys.
[23:28:40] <greg84> and the allow the login

[23:31:09] <greg84> I wanted to ask if there is everytime needed a username andpassword to be typed with the usb security key. Or if there are keys which can be just inserted and login automaically ?

[23:44:51] <ibs> I have a Yubikey. With that you just enter your pin code and then touch it. Done. Much simpler then username and password in my opionion. And much more secure..
[23:45:08] <shibboleth> "touch it"?
[23:45:19] <ibs> Yeah, I have a touch sensor on it.
[23:45:31] <shibboleth> like, a non-button push button?
[23:45:54] <ibs> Yes, to make sure the user is in control of the physical device.
[23:45:58] <shibboleth> sure
[23:46:39] <shibboleth> you've also likely had a tpm for several years and those offer way more in-depth security than a dongle

[23:48:29] <ibs> How do they help with the username/password dilemma?
[23:49:23] <shibboleth> you can store tokens, certificate, keys, etc in the tpm and protect them with pin, passphrase, certificate, keys, etc
[23:49:44] <shibboleth> also, you can prevent booting if bootloader/kernel/etc has been compromised
[23:50:15] <ibs> So I could have my ssh cert on tpm and unlock it with a pin?
[23:50:17] <shibboleth> and i'm guessing you're using some kinda software password manager with yubi integration, tpm also offers this
[23:50:20] <shibboleth> yes
[23:50:30] <ibs> How cool. I had no idea.
[23:50:46] <shibboleth> well, they've been standard in business-grade hw since like... vista
[23:51:02] <ibs> Yeah, I know.. but I never knew you could use them lika that.
