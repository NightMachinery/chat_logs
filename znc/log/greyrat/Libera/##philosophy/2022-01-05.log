[01:50:05] <causative> negation-as-failure is a large part of how humans think, and it's non-deductive
[01:50:41] <causative> the way it works is, we wonder if X is true.  So we try to think of some way to infer X.  If we try for long enough and hard enough, and fail, then we conclude probably not-X.
[01:51:19] <causative> the term "negation-as-failure" comes from logic programming, such as Prolog, where it works the same way; a failure of the logic engine to infer X means that the logic engine infers not-X
[01:52:30] <causative> negation-as-failure is used to support "default reasoning."  For example, dogs normally have four legs.  So we have an inference rule that says:  if we can't think of a specific reason why a dog *doesn't* have four legs, then we'll conclude it (probably) has four legs.
[01:53:17] <causative> this is called "default reasoning" because the "default" assumption is that the dog has four legs
[01:59:38] <causative> in logic programming, negation-as-failure means that the logic engine exhausted every possible way to deduce X, before concluding not-X
[02:00:11] <causative> the human brain often isn't so comprehensive; we don't usually check every possible way to deduce X, we often just try some of them until we give up

[06:29:36] <Jong> What do you guys think about vocabulary tests in standardized tests? I think it's a bad idea because if you took the 2000 most commonly used words, you could probably use them in combinations to replace every other less common word.   All that vocab tests test is just exposure to less common words. But exposure to less common words doesn't imply great reasoning skills, great short term memory, great mental visualization abilities, great
[06:29:36] <Jong>  creativity, great abilities in synthesis (creating a whole from parts), great abilities in analysis (breaks a whole into parts), or great abilities in method (organizing ideas well for others to easily understand).

[15:56:15] <arryana> haha.  if i don't agree with you, you can ignore my opinion.  there's no reason for me to keep my own to myself just because you don't like it
[15:56:18] <arryana> that's what /ignore is for
[15:56:22] <pussipupu> It doesn't
[15:56:41] <pussipupu> Though I'm guessing that was intended as a joke to be fair
[15:56:52] <arryana> i'm not sure i understand your take, though
[15:56:53] <arryana> ahh
[15:57:03] <arryana> delf jokes often seem to go over my head.
[15:57:36] <arryana> i mean, from where i sit, if my differing opinion is wrong, it's dismissable.  if it's right, you've learned something.  i don't see the problem.
[15:57:47] <brigand> especially if you miss context cause you ignore so many
[16:00:09] <Delf> /ignore arryana's opinion
[16:00:18] <arryana> haha
[16:05:15] <Delf> Most people who harbors what I call religious mental thought patterns, irrespective of their religious affiliation or lack of... disagree with me
[16:05:25] <Delf> That would be 99.99% of the people
[16:06:38] <arryana> wow.
[16:06:43] <arryana> that's a big claim.
[16:06:50] <Delf> How so?
[16:07:02] <arryana> i've never met 99.99% of people.
[16:07:41] <Delf> 99.99% of the people i meet, not 99.99% of people (including aliens on other planets)
[16:09:35] <arryana> have you met aliens from other planets?
[16:09:55] <Delf> Belief, reality, truth, fact, emotions sense of self... these all have a irritating relationship with one another
[16:10:28] <Delf> Now why the hell would you ask such a question? Do you want to expose me? Put me in harms way? Do you know what they'll do to me if I confess?
[16:11:17] *** Quits: krb (~krb@gateway/vpn/pia/krb) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[16:12:10] <arryana> i'm asking because if you believe that, i'll take everything you say with a larger grain of salt.
[16:12:38] <Delf> If I believe I've met aliens from other planets?
[16:12:45] <arryana> if you were worried about being 'exposed' you wouldn't have brought it up in the first place
[16:13:01] <Delf> I don't believe I have but I don't believe I haven't also. Does that make sense to you?
[16:13:15] * arryana shrugs
[16:13:31] <Delf> You don't know if it makes sense?
[16:13:56] <arryana> it's irrelevent.  and a dubious statement i don't actually believe.
[16:14:00] <Delf> I don't know if I have met or haven't met. I am unable to determine at this point
[16:14:30] <Delf> You don't actually believe I've met aliens from others planets?
[16:14:56] <arryana> not without some evidence, no
[16:15:10] <Delf> Interesting indeed
[16:15:19] <Delf> But you require no evidence whatsoever to believe the opposite?
[16:15:49] *** Joins: krb (~krb@gateway/vpn/pia/krb)
[16:15:50] <Delf> Because usually when you say you don't believe, it's more of a I DO BELiEVE (opposing position)
[16:15:59] <arryana> no.  i don't require evidence not to believe in unicorns, dragons, the tooth fairy, or the easter bunny either
[16:16:34] <Delf> You're either neutral or your not
[16:17:00] <Delf> If you BELiEVE there are no unicorns is not the same as not believing there are unicorns
[16:17:16] <Delf> The former is religious and latter is neutral, agnostic
[16:17:53] <Delf> It is ok to not know, whether or not there are unicorns
[16:18:02] <arryana> to me that's a meaningless distinction.  but if you want to embrace it, go on with your bad self, as it were.
[16:18:18] <arryana> it has nothing to do with religion for me, just plain reason.
[16:18:31] <Delf> The thought pattern is religious
[16:18:36] <arryana> i've never seen any evidence of such things, nor of any evidence that anyone else ever has.
[16:18:41] <Delf> Even if it has no religious affiliations
[16:18:45] <arryana> which is simple concrete thinking
[16:18:52] <arryana> if you want to term it 'religious', that's on you.
[16:19:21] <Delf> I term it religious because the patterns are similar, they DEMAND defense and may even require attack, for preservation
[16:19:45] <arryana> just because things have surface similarities in your mind does not validate such a provocative categorization, to me.
[16:20:04] <arryana> it's nothing to me either way what you believe, apart from how reliable i think you are personally.
[16:20:06] <Delf> Provocative categorization?
[16:20:20] <Delf> I'm more reliable than a mountain
[16:21:19] <arryana> not from where i sit, if you're going to categorize things so loosely and with such personal interpretation.
[16:22:00] <Lumine> Good day
[16:23:05] <arryana> heya lumi

[16:28:09] <Delf> There was no attempts at provoking btw
[16:28:31] <arryana> nope.  i'm a lot less in a hurry to categorize people to that extent.  i'd rather take them one at a time.
[16:28:57] *** Quits: rodolphoeck (~rodolphoe@user/rodolphoeck) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:29:22] <Delf> I'm not taking you two or more at a time
[16:30:55] <Delf> You're working with a provocative category yourself already, it's called idiots. The ones on your ignore list. Now this is not to say that I categorize similar. People with religious thought patterns do not need to be idiots
[16:31:00] <arryana> from where i sit it looks like you're saying, 'believe what i claim to or i will dump you in this personally defined category'
[16:31:06] <Delf> No
[16:31:09] <Delf> That's not what I say
[16:31:14] <arryana> which is your option. but it doesn't mean a lot to me
[16:31:52] <arryana> i don't think everyone on my /ignore list is an idiot.  i think everyone on my /ignore list is someone i don't personally care to spend time or energy reading.
[16:32:11] <Delf> I was using it as an example
[16:32:31] <Lumine> I don't think I have anyone on my ignore list
[16:32:54] <Lumine> I usually just switch chats if I don't have the energy for someone
[16:33:10] <arryana> it should be an accurate example, or it's meaningless
[16:33:33] <Delf> The accuracy was in the working with categories, not the naming of the categories
[16:34:59] <Delf> Did I provoke unpleasant feelings_
[16:35:21] <Delf> s/_/?/
[16:35:21] <ro-bot-o> Delf meant to say: Did I provoke unpleasant feelings?
[16:37:10] <arryana> nope.  i just don't think it's a meaningful grouping from where i sit.
[16:37:19] <arryana> you're welcome to it for yourself, though
[16:38:10] <Delf> Thank you :)
[16:40:19] <Delf> The similarities are NOT surface similarities, they are deeply related with the stance we have on our orientation capabilities (determining reality) and the defensiveness to protect our belief (emotional investment)
[16:41:44] <arryana> in your opinion.
[16:41:45] <arryana> not in mine.
[16:42:13] <Delf> Of course. You state yours I state mine. I don't have anything to learn from you if I'm the one stating your opinion
[16:42:56] <arryana> you don't know my opinions to state them, you can only guess.
[16:46:35] <Delf> You imagine there is a barrier preventing me from knowing things because they happen to be your opinions?
[16:47:05] <arryana> haha
[16:47:20] <arryana> do you think you know the beliefs of every stranger you meet?
[16:48:03] <arryana> do you believe i know your opinions?
[16:48:27] * Lumine knows everything
[16:48:51] <Lumine> Well, an approximation anyway of everything
[16:48:54] <arryana> haha
[16:51:48] <Delf> No, I make effort to determine the belief of every stranger I meet and I'm rarely ever successful. I have a neutral stance on that, I don't know what you know about me
[16:53:09] <Delf> If I had to guess, I'd say you don't know much about me at all. But I have no reliable way of determining what you know also
