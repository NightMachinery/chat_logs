[17:24:57] <skye0> finally got around to setting up my HMRC account so I use Aegis Authenticator as the 2FA
[17:25:18] <skye0> I like that it's open source, hate that there's nothing out there truly cross-platform for similar 2FA authenticators
[17:26:38] <labrador> skye0, why would you need a cross platform 2fa authenticator?
[17:27:53] <skye0> simply because even though there are alternatives to Android, they're very limited (i.e. I have to use custom ROMs, and they aren't thriving as healthily as they used to). plus, it's not exactly that convenient to lug around a laptop when some people expect you to conduct business over the phone too
[17:27:57] <skye0> these days
[17:28:04] <skye0> and not just through phone calls but through apps
[17:30:57] <labrador> skye0, isn't aegis just a totp/hotp authenticator? There's dozens out there for all platforms lol

[17:33:21] <labrador> oh
[17:48:11] <skye0> with enough work (by virtue of them being open source) I could get them to work on both, but fundamentally, it'd be incredibly inelegant and slow to do so
