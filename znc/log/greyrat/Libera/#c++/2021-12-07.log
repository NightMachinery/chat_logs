[03:05:16] <manuels> let it be a pure virtual class (interface) otherwise the ond definiton rule would apply I guess. and the linker would refuse to load the lib
[03:05:36] <Raziel> Oxyd, weird that the others don't need it. but yeah, that seems to do it, along with adding std::ref on the return
[03:06:00] <manuels> what happens when 1) the classes are the same and 2) the interface differs?
[03:06:53] <Raziel> also, is using references to map elements like that valid? I mean, it seems to work fine, but
[03:07:13] <Oxyd> Raziel: Standard library headers may optionally include other standard library headers, but, except in a few cases, aren't required to. So that's why some compilers accept it but others don't.

[03:37:18] <RandomReader> manuels - all of that would be about particular implementations, not the language standard .. as in, the language does not specify a linker, or libraries that can be loaded dynamically, or any of that
[03:37:51] <RandomReader> ODR certainly applies in general, but that's not how all implementations handle exports/imports for their dynamic systems
[03:38:23] <RandomReader> would be the sort of topic better for #c++-general or one of the implementation channels
[03:39:23] <RandomReader> in terms of the language, an abstract class (pure virtual) doesn't change ODR at all, which applies to pretty much everything
[03:41:00] <RandomReader> because of the separate translation phases (TUs being compiled independently), there are several kinds of ODR violations a typical compiler and linker won't detect, but the result would still be UB
[03:41:59] <RandomReader> RTTI doesn't affect this one way or another, it's just a mechanism built on the same language rules as everything else

[03:52:38] <Raziel> Alipha, I know. What I don't know if there's supposed to be a nice/workable way of doing this with references, or if this is pointer territory
[03:52:43] <Raziel> is if*
[03:53:22] <Raziel> wherein "this" is returning a reference to an element in a container (a map, in this case)
[03:54:25] <Alipha> Raziel: is there a "but"?
[03:54:56] <Raziel> Alipha, the current "but" is that it seems my current way of doing it is actually making a local copy of said element and returning a reference to that local copy
[03:55:07] <Raziel> rather than a reference to the actual thing in the map

[03:55:34] <Alipha> Raziel: it's UB to return a reference to a local variable
[03:55:51] <Raziel> well, yeah. but I don't wanna return a reference to a local variable, I wanna return a reference to the element in the map. :(
[03:56:01] <RandomReader> this sounds less like "reference vs pointer" and more like "insufficient use of references"
[03:56:51] <RandomReader> e.g.   map[key]   is already a reference, so don't try to stick a non-reference between that and your return
[03:57:21] <RandomReader> what's the actual scenario?

[04:00:41] <Raziel> Alipha, I was doing it from an iterator I got with find, and I wasn't sure how to get a ref out of it. seems just explicit casting ->second to ref for the return works alright, although other methods were failing to cast
[04:00:48] <Raziel> thankees
[04:01:04] <RandomReader> er, no, don't cast
[04:01:16] <Raziel> well shit

[04:04:17] <Raziel> RandomReader, so it should just be a return type of int& instead of ref wrapper, mayhaps?
[04:04:22] *** Joins: Rayke (rayke@user/rayke)
[04:04:36] <RandomReader> if you intend for this to be a function that can fail, then pick one of:   pointer with nullptr signaling failure, or reference with exception signaling failure
[04:04:38] <Raziel> it does work with ref wrapper if I do explicitly cast, I did confirm it's not doing shenanigans, but, idk if it's actually UB or what :p
[04:04:57] <Alipha> Raziel: so, the error is that you have a const map and a const iterator, but you're trying to have a non-const reference_wrapper refer to it
[04:05:12] <Raziel> yeah, I'll add exceptions, although in most cases where I want to map things like this silent-failing with a specific "null" element of that type is valid
[04:05:30] <Alipha> but indeed, you probably want a `int*` or a `const int*`, not reference_wrapper
[04:05:31] <Raziel> Alipha, removing the const on the iterator doesn't seem to change much, but yeah, I did forget that part
[04:05:35] <RandomReader> there's no such thing in this case though
[04:05:46] <RandomReader> "int" has a specific range of values, there's no sentinel
[04:05:53] <Alipha> Raziel: the map is also const, which means find will still return a const iterator
[04:06:06] <Raziel> RandomReader, right, but the int is just for example. this is gonna be used for more specific stuff (handles that do have an invalid handle sentinel, etc)
[04:06:17] <RandomReader> ah ok
[04:06:39] <RandomReader> for this kind of interface, the sentinel needs to be stored somewhere though
[04:06:48] <Raziel> Alipha, the type_index map is const, the others are not
[04:07:01] <RandomReader> so you're setting yourself up for either a container with a static member, or global-ish constants somewhere
[04:07:11] <Alipha> Raziel: const auto& myMap = ... ;   // myMap is const
[04:07:12] <Raziel> yeah, they're global-ish const data

[04:09:22] <Raziel> RandomReader, I'm not against doing exceptions instead either. realistically, since this is enum mapping, it can never actually be called with an invalid one, but, either way. not really relevant to the ref part :p

[04:10:33] <RandomReader> but yes using a reference with a sentinel object signaling failure would be a third option

[07:31:44] <sprout_> my language rewrites a graph,  most of the graph consists of arrays of atoms,  preferably I'll get rid of the vector all together since it's way too performance degrading
[07:32:04] <sprout_> millions of allocations/deallocations of vector is a bit much,  maybe
[07:34:02] *** Quits: biberu (~biberu@user/biberu) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:34:49] <zz> well, if you were contemplating about struct with hanging data, your array size is known at the time of allocation, so using vector::reserve would fit the bill too
[07:36:12] <sprout_> the problem is that that's two allocations.  one for vector,  one for some pointer to an array (or whatever) it holds internally
[07:36:28] <sprout_> preferably I'll just allocate one array,  and nothing more
[07:37:08] <sprout_> it's just double the work for every rewrite in my graph rewriter so I want to half the number of allocations
[07:38:50] <sprout_> or I just give up on the entire object hierarchy,  which I'll do after the prototype.   but flexible objects could solve this for this prototype interpreter

[07:45:07] <sprout_> heh.  I'll see whether I can adapt it to the object hierarchy.   this allocates and array of S's I think (glancing over it).  what I need is an S with an array of variable size (since otherwise it doesn't fit neatly into my class hierarchy)

[07:46:12] <sprout_> right.   value = atom | array (value*).  <- that's roughly the class hierarchy
[07:46:58] <Alipha> sprout_: `new (20) S(20)` allocates an S object and 20 T's stored in memory adjacent to it

[14:41:39] <lockywolf> PJBoy, I think, in Java "everything is a pointer", although I am not very sure.
[14:42:40] <PJBoy> move ctor is a ctor that has a rvalue reference parameter, semantically indicating that the parameter object is expiring and so you can gut it and steal its resources if you want
[14:43:09] <furrymcgee> I suppose call destructor and placement new with copy constructor
[14:43:29] <PJBoy> nothing enforces that you do take advantage of this resource stealing opportunity though
[14:44:45] <PJBoy> ok you're way too new to C++ to be thinking about calling dtors and placement new
[14:45:13] <PJBoy> those things basically never come up
[14:45:36] <PJBoy> if you're writing a constructor, calling a dtor makes no sense whatsoever, as the object hasn't even been constructed
[14:46:45] <PJBoy> placement new has complicated rules regarding when and how it's valid to use the resulting object
[14:47:30] <furrymcgee> ?
[14:47:58] <PJBoy> yeah exactly

[15:03:11] <RandomReader> to expand on some of the underlying C++ specifics, value vs reference semantics depends on how you use the types (vs the types themselves), so assignment isn't about variables (symbolic names) but about the objects themselves
[15:03:38] <RandomReader> ("object" being "conceptual container for a value", which is basically everything in C++ .. not specifically OOP things associated with "class")
[15:05:49] <RandomReader> objects in turn have lifetime, type-based characteristics associated with them, and expectations on how they're accessed .. so they don't get silently "replaced" in any sense
[15:06:38] <RandomReader> (so syntactically, variable1 = variable2 assignment is always going to perform the operation for both of those existing objects, it can't remove/replace the object in variable1)

[15:11:17] <RandomReader> the act of attempting to modify its storage, e.g. with memcpy or placement new or similar, is therefore formally undefined .. in practice one of the common side effects is that because it's known to be constant, the value is propagated or cached, so changing it leads to mixed results instead of intended behavior
[15:12:19] <RandomReader> (but since the modification attempt is undefined, it can lead to more difficult to explain outcomes, since there aren't any constraints on what may happen)

[18:32:49] <RandomReader> no, C++ standard library type names are all snake_case
[18:33:15] <artok> StreamReader sounds like Windows thingie
[18:33:56] <TinoDidriksen> Tyaku, the closest equivalent is std::istream which can be used with files via std::ifstream or any other stream-compatible read-only source such as std::cin

[19:00:37] <Tyaku> Thanks, another dummy question: I have a thread function defined in a class, the thread is initialised by the class (in a start() function). I want to pass on my thread the instance of the class so that inside the thread i can keep instance parameters/properties.
[19:01:08] <Tyaku> I did this using a pointer, but i get this error: std::thread arguments must be invocable after conversion to rvalues
[19:01:52] <Tyaku> I also try something like this "void MyClass::Runner(MyClass& context)"
[19:02:56] <Tyaku> The problems seems to be when i do this: "std::thread t1(Runner, this);"

[19:05:18] <PJBoy> that's gonna need a `this` and `*this` argument to be invoked

[22:19:50] <jellie> I don't understand why L 36-38 don't seem to have an effect
[22:20:08] <jellie> Like I basically have a vector of maps and I want to pick a map at an index and update it
[22:20:13] <jellie> then pick another map etc
[22:20:26] <InPhase> jellie: The question might work better with a working testcase.
[22:20:36] <InPhase> !give jellie testcase
[22:20:37] <nolyc> jellie: A testcase is the _least_ amount of code that replicates your problem, paste it to https://wandbox.org/ then: 1) click run 2) click share 3) click url and 4) paste the url for us. You _must_ use that website. Do _not_ use a different website. Do _not_ paste code to the channel. See the testcase checklist at http://eel.is/iso-c++/testcase/
[22:20:47] <imMute> jellie: line 19 makes a copy of each item in the vector.  you probably want "auto &" there
[22:21:29] <jellie> Thanks for that tip imMute
[22:22:33] <imMute> jellie: that's maybe the problem, I didn't study the code very much. just saw "this thing doesn't update" inside a for-loop that uses auto instead of auto&
