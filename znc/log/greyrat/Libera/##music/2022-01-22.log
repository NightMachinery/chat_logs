[00:02:01] <macrobat> freebsd was a little annoying. didn't have a central repo, it went and fetched software from the original sites, so it took a while. some places weren't reachable and there was a timeout to wait for. if the missing software was higher up in the dependency hierarchy, whatever depended on it wouldn't be updated

[05:04:49] <morf> they are complete shit nowhadays 
[05:04:58] <artao> that's light scottish
[05:05:06] <morf> they add something to the cigarettes to burn faster no? 
[05:05:24] <artao> some do
[05:05:33] <louipc> i thought it was to make it more even, and slower
[05:05:40] <artao> moreso so bands of thiner and thicker paper
[05:05:41] <morf> yeah
[05:05:51] <morf> they add something to burn slower (in case of fire) 
[05:05:56] <morf> that's why it doesn't make much sense
[05:05:59] <artao> the thick stuff smoulders a bit then hits the thin stuff and burns quick ... makes sure it stays lit
[05:06:18] <louipc> if it was straight paper it would burn way faster wouldnt it
[05:06:25] <artao> and not to burn faster .... just to keep it burning
[05:06:28] <louipc> cigars have moisture to slow them down
[05:06:35] <louipc> cigarettes have chemicals
[05:06:40] <artao> natural tobacco goes out if you leave it sitting there
[05:06:41] <morf> but if i roll one slim shorter golden virginia myself it burns like twice as long than "normal" cigarette

[05:06:52] <louipc> what about cigars
[05:06:57] <morf> they too 
[05:07:03] <artao> i don't know much about cigars
[05:07:06] <louipc> oh yea i guess u gotta keep pulling
[05:07:12] <morf> y
[05:07:13] <louipc> to keep it going maybe
[05:07:14] <artao> however i thought think that that larger coal alone would keep it burning
[05:07:23] <louipc> i never left a cigar sitting
[05:07:29] <louipc> rarely smoked them
[05:07:36] <morf> even normal cigarette should stop burning if you leave it alone and don't pull 
[05:07:53] <louipc> handrolled or?
[05:07:58] <artao> morf correct
[05:08:08] <artao> so they alter it to keep it burning

[05:12:36] <louipc> oh yea the safety features
[05:12:48] <morf> As of August 26, 2011, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had passed state legislation modeled on New York's original bill, mandating the sale of fire-safe cigarettes.

[05:13:59] <artao> fat people fall asleep or die sitting there with a lit cigarette, out of which the coal falls onto their clothes and lights it on fire which ignites the person's fat which smoulders away slowly like a candle
[05:14:14] <artao> they tested it on pigs and got the same thing as what is found with humans
[05:16:30] <artao> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_human_combustion#Suggested_explanations
[05:16:30] <Janet> ^ Spontaneous human combustion - Wikipedia
[05:17:08] <artao> that said, spontaneous combustion certainly occurs quite spontaneously with other stuff
[05:17:19] <artao> like linseed oil rags in a can
[05:18:08] <artao> oil painters have to get fire-safe cans to keep their rags and such from spontaneously bursting into flame. cuz all bundled in their causes an exothermic reaction which gets hot enuf to ignite the rags
[05:18:22] <artao> and places like auto-shops. their oil rags
[05:18:30] <artao> but that's not humans
[05:20:38] <artao> still ...
[05:20:47] <artao> there are cases that don't fit that hypothesis
[05:22:59] <artao> i've got an OLLLD sci-fi story idea about spontaneous combustion
[05:23:59] <louipc> only certain oils have that reaction, but due to nanny safety rules lots of ppl get the firecans

[07:23:40] <artao> hmm .... honestly?
[07:24:02] <artao> i wouldn't include the model 55 in a Top 10 list. most influential? perhaps
[07:24:16] <artao> i'd put the minimoog in the top 10 before the model 55
[07:24:43] <artao> i'm not sure ... did emerson ever play a model D? i thought he just played the full modulars
[07:24:47] <artao> i'm prolly wrong tho

[14:29:52] <artao> powdered butter? :O
[14:30:16] <artao> also powdered peanut butter and many other powdered things that have no business being powder
[14:30:50] <dTal> "This is the milk starches with the oil removed. It is best reconstituted with light vegetable oil, then chilled, to make a firm spread, like butter. Mix with water and a little vinegar, then chill, to make a sour cream substitute. Adding vinegar, water and spices produces a passable mayonnaise. The powder can be mixed straight into dough, noodles or mashed potatoes. For a treat, use it straight in tea or coffee; it‚Äôs tasty and comforting. It 
[14:30:50] <dTal> doesn‚Äôt do well sprinkled straight on popcorn. I would mix some of the oil/butter mix straight into the hot popcorn. Nice product, good price. Especially if you have no refrigeration, and would like a creamy dairy-like sauce base. No, it‚Äôs not butter. But it‚Äôs tasty and useful."
[14:31:00] <dTal> seems like a reasonable product
[14:31:35] <dTal> although "best reconstituted with light vegetable oil, then chilled" and " best reconstituted with light vegetable oil, then chilled" seem at odds

[21:06:20] <SteppenwolfVM> the Matrixbrute is super cool tho
[21:06:34] <krb> i look forward to trying it out, it will be my first synth
[21:06:43] <SteppenwolfVM> nice choice for first synth
[21:06:48] <krb> ty :)
[21:07:34] <krb> i just got a 88 key midi keyboard a few days ago, do you think it can be used to get the full range for the matrixbrute? i saw it had a midi input
[21:09:34] <SteppenwolfVM> i don't know, i didn't try the Matrixbrute
[21:09:52] <krb> ok

[21:16:10] <krb> yeah
[21:17:14] <krb> my sons is 6 and 4. it wasn't a big success getting them to learn a classical guitar and viola. so i thought a synth might make things a little more interesting
[21:17:18] <SteppenwolfVM> the things you can do on a Matrixbrute alone tho, you can produce entire albums with just the Matrixbrute, at least theoretically

[21:18:33] <SteppenwolfVM> it was pretty nice then
[21:18:44] <SteppenwolfVM> tho i had a very patient and friendly teacher, been lucky
[21:18:53] <krb> i've found allot of cool programs for learning piano now. i have some midis playing and showing notes at the same time, and it doesn't go forward before they hit the right one
[21:19:45] <SteppenwolfVM> that's one way, i've always needed a teacher tho
[21:20:00] <SteppenwolfVM> without a teacher telling me what to do i can't take learning serious :D
[21:20:26] <krb> i'm going to try and teach them myself
[21:20:36] <krb> i did get a few hours with piano training some years ago
[21:21:49] <SteppenwolfVM> if you can afford it a good teacher is worth millions tho
[21:22:21] <krb> yeah, that's a good idea
[21:23:38] <SteppenwolfVM> if you loose trust in your abilities, become depressive as you feel like you're stuck, are sad because you do the same mistakes for months or years.. a good teacher will always know how to bring you back on track and move you forward

[22:33:42] <murthy> I was looking for some flute notes of a nice flute music. I found a website that had it but it contained the word chords. There was a note like "Cm", Does "Cm" signify a chord if so does "m" in "Cm" signify major or minor chord?
