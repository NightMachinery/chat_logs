[10:35:56] <Arya[m]> kitty can do it probably lol
[10:36:24] <Arya[m]> you can convert it to image and use kitty image thing 
[10:36:28] <pystardust> terminal == tty, everything is gui, or gui emulating tty
[10:36:50] <Arya[m]> you can startx kitty so no dwm?
[10:37:28] <pystardust> oh yeah, true. Maybe ill just startx zathura, nice idea, but i would need to switch ttys right
[10:38:05] <mangeshrex[m]> Ahh
[10:38:40] <Arya[m]> there is actually a project for it  
[10:38:41] <Arya[m]> https://github.com/dsanson/termpdf.py

[11:03:02] <_devnull[m]> <pystardust> "have u guys tried this https://..." <- written in python
[11:03:16] <pystardust> no its written in c and python, both work
[11:03:37] <pystardust> i tried the c one, it is usable but not ideal 
[11:08:39] <_devnull[m]> there is a dwm equalant tmux
[11:08:45] <_devnull[m]> i forgot its name
[11:28:31] <_devnull[m]> @pystardust yes its dvtm
[11:32:41] <klimi[m]> heh... i don't even use tmux... it seems I am a noob
[11:32:51] <gtlsgamr> Hi there! 
[11:32:53] <gtlsgamr> dwm >>>>
[11:33:01] <gtlsgamr> tmux is not a window manager. periodt
[11:35:31] <klimi[m]> tmux is not a window manager... exactly...
[11:35:46] <klimi[m]> i am ok with using whatever
[11:36:13] <klimi[m]> i run cinnamon on work, xfce of vnc, machines i manintan run gnome ubuntu and my personal laptop is arch with i3
[11:38:24] <gtlsgamr> I would love to use a FWM, but too used to dwm
[11:38:38] <gtlsgamr> it is not a matter of being l33t anymore
[11:38:42] <gtlsgamr> just use what feels best
[11:41:03] <klimi[m]> ye
[12:30:38] <_devnull[m]> <gtlsgamr> "just use what feels best" <- for a ricer window managers are just a places to visit. like a tourist.
[12:30:38] <PriyanshuRai[m]> <pystardust> "friendship ended with dwm..." <- Tmux is powerful as hell. I use sway with Arch btw.
[12:31:06] <PriyanshuRai[m]> _devnull[m]: True üëç
[12:31:09] <klimi[m]> PriyanshuRai[m]: sway + tmux?
[12:31:36] <gtlsgamr> My proton is fucked up
[12:31:44] <PriyanshuRai[m]> klimi[m]: Yes, I use tmux too but mostly for ssh and irc. I have powerline too.
[12:31:44] <gtlsgamr> It gives 4 fps now
[12:31:48] <gtlsgamr> after one of the updates
[12:32:10] <PriyanshuRai[m]> gtlsgamr: Open it through terminal and try to spot the errors.
[12:32:22] <pystardust> _devnull[m]: yeah dvtm is a nice alternative
[12:32:33] <gtlsgamr> PriyanshuRai[m]: The log file is 35 mb. :( Been trying for a while, will try some more
[12:32:37] <PriyanshuRai[m]> * powerline too(most would have lol).
[12:32:58] <PriyanshuRai[m]> gtlsgamr: Try it realtime, you might find somethimg.
[12:34:00] <gtlsgamr> Let's see I am trying it right now
[12:36:11] <klimi[m]> PriyanshuRai[m]: what's powerline?
[12:36:27] <klimi[m]> gtlsgamr: what a small log :D
[12:38:56] <gtlsgamr> yep :( no more cowboying for me 
[12:52:45] <_devnull[m]> <gtlsgamr> "yep :( no more cowboying for me..." <- cowboying?
[12:53:11] <gtlsgamr> I play red dead online
