[17:36:00] <bambanxx> hi
[17:39:56] <bambanxx> grids replace flexbox?
[17:40:07] <bambanxx> can i do all that can i do with flexbox with grids?
[17:41:06] <undefined_bob> you are a bit late lol, bambanxx
[17:41:16] <undefined_bob> but yeah grids are powerful
[17:41:17] <bambanxx> why undefined_bob ?
[17:41:35] <bambanxx> i know flexbox, but am curious about grids
[17:41:42] <undefined_bob> but for me flexbox is easier but once you master grid you will have great options
[17:42:00] <undefined_bob> bambanxx: because that topic is already a few years old
[17:42:07] <undefined_bob> when grid was new
[17:42:20] <bambanxx> can you update me a bit please
[17:42:22] <bambanxx> ok
[17:42:25] <bambanxx> i will study

[17:52:23] <shan> undefined_bob: that's what i'm doing currently
[17:52:28] <bambanxx> i love you grids
[17:52:28] <shan> just wondering if there's a better way
[17:54:23] <undefined_bob> shan: I think that is the best way
[17:54:42] <undefined_bob> resolutions on some smartphones are as high as some desktops
[17:54:54] <undefined_bob> so you cant go reliable with resolution
[17:55:12] <shan> yeah
[17:55:26] <shan> if only there was a way to get approx screen size
[17:55:38] <undefined_bob> you could try to do the width and hight in @media with cm but I'm not sure if that even works with cm
[17:55:42] <shan> even "<8inches" would be enough to go on
[17:55:59] <shan> yeah i said screw it and added UA matching
[17:56:13] <shan> it's kinda scummy and i'm sure it'll break for someone with a privacy browser thingie
[17:56:15] <shan> but
[17:56:17] * shan shrugs
[17:57:15] <undefined_bob> but yes, you can use the so-called absolute units in CSS

[18:13:07] <bambanxx> what is the diff between fr and %?
[18:17:26] <entuland> mostly convenience to decide the ratio
[18:17:49] <entuland> since fr will affect each other in a context such as flex or grid
[18:18:23] <entuland> dividing a grid with repeat(3, 1fr) is pretty much the same as saying repeat(3, 33.3%) or something
[18:18:23] <bambanxx> cant visualize the diff yet of using % and fr
[18:18:41] <entuland> the difference is in how you express the ratios
[18:19:09] <entuland> 3fr 1fr is the same as 75% 25%
[18:19:59] <bambanxx> ok entuland ty
[18:20:04] <entuland> yw
[18:22:25] <bambanxx> grids have overflow like flexbox ?

[18:24:00] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[18:24:34] <entuland> no, there shouldn't be any overflow / reflowing, if you have too much stuff, the grid itself may break out of its container

[19:27:17] <bambanxx> programming mobile first, its load the medias for desktop? how works in terms of performance?
[19:30:36] *** Joins: theseb (~cs@47-220-214-54.cnrocmta03.res.dyn.suddenlink.net)
[19:31:44] <entuland> yes, you can decide where to put anything in a grid
[19:32:10] <entuland> and no, doesn't make any difference if you design mobile first and add media queries for larger viewports or the other way around
[19:32:16] <bambanxx> entuland on mobile first programing, on a phone it will load the desktop version too?
[19:32:32] <entuland> there is no "loading" of the desktop version
[19:32:39] <entuland> what matters is what rules get applied
[19:32:57] <entuland> your markup should be the same in both cases, just rendered differently according to the media queries
[19:33:11] <entuland> if a media query doesn't match, its rules will not be applied, simple as that
[19:33:21] <bambanxx> ok
[19:33:41] <bambanxx> i though it change loading
[19:33:53] <bambanxx> and improve performance
[19:34:16] <hassoon> 'evening
[19:34:33] <bambanxx> well it does in a way it will not apply example a image for desktop wich is larger than mobile
[19:35:00] <entuland> the point is that it doesn't make any difference if you design mobile first or desktop first, the end result would be the same
[19:35:21] <entuland> the rules loading, say, additional backgrounds via CSS wouldn't fire anyways if the media queries don't match
[19:40:46] <bambanxx> ok entuland
[19:41:19] <bambanxx> programing mobile first aproach is use the medias for desktop and tablets? and the stuff outside of the media is the mobile ?
