[19:25:40] <Geth> ¦ doc: after (`rx/:s pattern/`), but the docs only mentioned the first option.  This fixes that, and
[19:25:41] <Geth> ¦ doc: brings the rx section of the page into alignment with the adverb section.
[19:25:41] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/000ff6852a
[19:25:43] <linkable6> Link: https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes
[19:35:50] <holyghost> v0.1.5 of Game::Quest has been uploaded, it has a BAM (bi-assoc matrix) system for parsing "look at" in a row and "body" in a column then firing an action (func for now)
[19:36:42] <holyghost> Then there's a LoopObject class for having in-game movies/non-keyb input game loops
[19:36:57] <holyghost> or anything like that, it should just be an SDL loop
[19:37:08] <holyghost> the thing is based on the SDL package
[19:38:03] <holyghost> Everything is left to clean code so you can jam about your games, and as someone told me, you better write scenarios :-)
[19:39:10] <holyghost> the BAM is based on a hacker's understanding of an old Sierra text interface. You type "look at room" not "I want to look at the room"
[19:39:34] <holyghost> It was made on a mac 11
[19:41:25] <holyghost> If you grok the raku SDL package, you're set for making old Sierra adeventure games
[19:41:43] <holyghost> I've not put any examples in it
[19:43:07] <holyghost> anyway, SDL events understanding should help
[19:44:21] <holyghost> Game::Quest should be usable right now, I'll see what I can add later on
[19:44:35] <holyghost> I'm off for the weekend, HAND

[20:15:55] <tonyo> .tell tbrowder a PR would be great - i like the idea of using env vars to override defaults and leaving the defaults as is
[20:15:56] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[22:58:19] <melezhik> I am reading this - https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-webapp-template#Conditionals , still not sure if I can use if else statements in cro templates
[23:04:20] <lizmat> melezhik: you can not, afaik
[23:04:44] <lizmat> <?foo> ... </?><!foo>  ... </!>
[23:04:52] <lizmat> is the closest thing I know
[23:09:35] <melezhik> yeah, already applied something similar
[23:09:37] <melezhik> thanks
[23:10:21] <lizmat> it would be nice to have something like that, but the nature of HTML sorta makes that pretty difficult
