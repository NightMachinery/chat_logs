[17:58:10] <Jong> Does anyone here have experience with multihead attention? I'm trying to understand what kind of weights are used for the query, key, value projection matrices.  Are they whole numbers like 2,3,4,5 or are they decimal numbers between 0 and 1? What do they look like?

[18:02:48] <dostoyevsky2> sobobobobo: Did you read Suttons book?  Then thare the Deepmind RL youtube courses...  And it's always interesting to study some of DeepMind's releases (they do not use DQN, as they seem to often find more efficient algorithms that they use instead)
[18:03:19] <sobobobobo> yeap and the more mathy book which Sutton mentioned on his lectures
[18:06:18] <Jong> I'm looking at this: https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer
[18:06:19] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  Transformer model for language understanding | Text | TensorFlow
[18:06:41] <Jong> search for "self.wq = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)"
[18:06:52] <Jong> I'd like to print the weights of self.wq, but I can't figure out how
[18:07:25] <Jong> I also tried to print the weights in the forward call. search "q = self.wq(q)" to see it.  Couldn't print it there either
[18:07:35] <Jong> I tried .get_weights that's in the api docs but no good
[18:09:20] <HuntsMan> Jong: .get_weights() is correct, what is the issue?
[18:09:45] <Jong> the console prints "[]" (quotes excluded)
[18:10:07] <HuntsMan> Jong: show cod

[18:14:52] <Jong> see the "[]" in the debugger ?
[18:16:25] <Jong> oh I need to run build or compile or something
[18:16:48] <HuntsMan> Jong: that is probably because you did it in __init__, before things are initialized, the layers have not been built
