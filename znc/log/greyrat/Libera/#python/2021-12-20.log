[01:15:57] <ItsLandon> I'm starting work on a project that I hope to actually publish. I'm not familiar with "good practices" when it comes to Python as I'm primarily self-taught. I'd like to begin the project with good idioms/patterns. One of the things I'm not sure of is the best way to handle configuration state. I'm pretty comfortable with using a dict for configuration as I can just load or dump it with the JSON
[01:15:59] <ItsLandon> module. Is it poor practice to load it to a global? If so, what are some common methods of managing configuration state? I think I tend to avoid object-oriented Python since I don't like how much OOP hides.
[01:16:37] <InPhase> ItsLandon: First, get over the notion of avoiding OOP.  :)

[01:16:58] <aphysically> :P
[01:17:50] <InPhase> ItsLandon: The best way to handle configuration is usually to setup some class that will store your configuration state.  You can certainly load from a json to set this up, as configuration files should be in any sort of adequately flexible human-readable format.
[01:17:53] <Wulf> ItsLandon: I usually try to avoid module level variables. Instead instantiate some root class and add your configuration to it.
[01:18:05] <InPhase> ItsLandon: Then you generally want to pass configuration information around to what needs it.

[01:19:32] <InPhase> ItsLandon: Ideally you extract configuration information and THEN pass it.  What you do NOT want is having "knowledge" of your configuration file details spread all over a large program, because then if you ever want to change your configuration file arrangement, it's very hard because the details of that are spread all over in places that are hard to keep track of.  The goal should be to localize
[01:19:38] <InPhase> responsibility for managing things.
[01:19:45] <Wulf> globals() returns the namespace of the current module. That's hardly global despite its name.

[01:28:54] <InPhase> ItsLandon: For example, I needed to do a Morlet Wavelet Transform in some recent code.  The constructor of the class to do it receives an object of the MorletWaveletSettings class, which is a super simple class that just contains the variables I need for the settings.
[01:29:25] <InPhase> ItsLandon: That way when I need to add another setting for this, I just add it to the class.  I don't need to alter all the call sites or the interface.

[03:06:59] <Swayze> Lambda functions are used when you need a function for a short period of time. This is commonly used when you want to pass a function as an argument to higher-order functions, that is, functions that take other functions as their arguments.
[03:06:59] <nedbat> wyre: you can use them as arguments to other functions:   sort(key=lambda .....)
[03:07:05] <MacGyver> wyre: As a very bad, contrived example, map(lambda x: x+1, iterator)

[03:12:21] <ItsLandon> OK good to know. Thanks

[05:10:10] <ItsLandon> Jonno_FTW: by "using requests" are you referring to the Python module "requests"? If so, is there a specific reason to use python for this? I think I remember hearing about some tools which are specifically designed to stress-test https endpoints
[05:10:16] <parv> You would need to import the class in __init__.py from logger before calling the constructor: import logger; foolog = logger.Logger()

[08:57:29] <lilibyte> should imports be at the top like normal or contained within individual functions so they dont all need to be imported when only one function will be used

[08:58:41] <seanicus> I'd put them at the top

[10:56:57] <parv> psygate, I have not explored relative imports due to your originally stated requirement. If your modules would not be used outside the application, you could try use of relative imports & ask (others) about issues.
[10:57:24] <psygate> parv, yeah relative imports lead to some weird issues when trying to import within the subpackages.

[14:03:10] <kek_> hi, I just installed a dependency on 3.10 and got "ImportError: /home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/glue/ligolw/tokenizer.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: PyLong_FromUnicode". Now I understand that the shared object doesn't have the symbol PyLong_FromUnicode. The question is: Why? Did something change in cpython and the package I tried to install didn't "update" yet? (which is 100% possible) E.g. I can
[14:03:10] <kek_> solve it by using an older version like python 3.7 (which I  guess uses some older cpython version). Or maybe I completely misunderstand.

[15:04:30] <Shapeshifter> It does work for other assert methods, i.e. self.assertTrue(False, msg="stuff") correctly prints AssertionError: False is not true : stuff, but with assertRaises, this does not work correctly.

[15:12:36] <Rana_Ans36> deniska: Im trying this now: https://bpa.st/JJEA
[15:12:36] <Rana_Ans36> still displays Error 404
[15:12:36] <parv> wyre, Raising exception in "dev_is_parted" depends on its use. If you are using it as a stand alone verification function, raise exception. If you want to do different things based on return value, return True|False
[15:12:37] <Shapeshifter> http://pastie.org/p/2GzeA4VyT6VEjpt3VogNNv I mean, shouldn't I get an AssertionError from the assertRaises?
[15:12:51] <Shapeshifter> Instead, I just get the SyntaxError.
[15:13:17] <Shapeshifter> because I expected a ValueError but got a SyntaxError.
[15:13:26] <bjs> Shapeshifter: you should get a SyntaxError yeah
[15:13:35] <Shapeshifter> why not an AssertionError?
[15:13:35] <wyre> parv, you mean if I'm doing something like `try: dev_is_parted()`, right?
[15:13:47] <bjs> Shapeshifter: because the assertRaises talks about ValueError
[15:13:50] <wyre> and ... what would be the proper exception to raise, parv?

[15:14:24] <Shapeshifter> bjs: so the assertRaises context manager doesn't catch other exceptions, huh? It only catches the expected one, but lets all others bubble up.
[15:14:45] <bjs> Shapeshifter: yes, just like the docs says it does :P
[15:14:57] <bjs> Shapeshifter: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises  " The test passes if exception is raised, is an error if another exception is raised, or fails if no exception is raised. "
[15:14:59] <parv> wyre, I mean: def use_dev( dev ) : dev_is_parted( dev ); .. other things to do .... ;
[15:15:19] <wyre> parv, also ... I guess the raises will only replace the return False statements ... because when things go well ... I just can return True, right?
[15:15:26] <bjs> Shapeshifter: a test can pass (no exceptions), fail (raises AssertionError), or error (raises another exception).
[15:16:02] <Shapeshifter> A bit counterintuitive. Even if it's an error, why not append the msg="..." to the test output message?
[15:16:04] <parv> wyre, In case of stand alone verification use, no need to return anything.
[15:16:20] <Shapeshifter> msg= is only appended if the test fails, but not if it errors.
[15:16:24] <bjs> Shapeshifter: because it's not a ValueError
[15:16:27] <bjs> yes that seems correct ot me
[15:16:39] <Shapeshifter> So it seems. Guess I just learned this today.
[15:16:45] <parv> wyre, You could make custom error class: class DevIsNotParted( Exception ): pass;
[15:17:08] <bjs> Shapeshifter: in general, if you get an unrelated exception that's just a bug.  It's not really a "failed test" and the message won't apply
[15:17:20] <bjs> e.g. a syntax error in the middle of your program is unlikely to relate to your ValueError and its message
[15:17:39] <parv> wyre, Yes, where you return False, raise exception
[15:17:55] <wyre> parv, and would be able to use with 'raise DevIsNotParted(f"device {dev} is not parted")', right?

[16:19:16] <jrs-0> finding 't','r','e' again it finds 't','t','e' how is this possible if we have removed that from the some_string?

[19:31:10] <mrproper> I have an application which uses some tracing libraries for APM and those make a call to a local process. Because the local process isn't running on a desktop system it has a traceback after all tests have executed in pytest. How do I tell pytest to disable the module when it executes tests?
[19:31:15] <MacGyver> Julian: Uh, yeah, from functools import reduce would be the second statement in the first form.

[19:31:58] <Julian> mrproper: The "right" way is normally to allow your APM object to accept a fake
[19:32:02] <MacGyver> Right, hadn't yet considered the case where I'd want to import multiple elements. Thanks.
[19:32:07] <Julian> Preferably a verified one.
[19:32:17] <Julian> mrproper: Since you ideally should be testing your APM calls.
[19:32:26] <mrproper> Julian: In my particular case, I'm using Datadog which has the ddtrace library.
[19:32:44] <Julian> Right, so I've written verified fakes for datadog before but unfortunately they're not open source :/

[19:35:15] <Julian> mrproper: Which mechanism are you using to enable ddtrace
[19:35:25] <Julian> I'll try to find the issue but I suspect it wasn't about ddtrace it was about the metric client
[19:35:59] <mrproper> Julian: I'm using `patch(fastapi=True)` at the top of my application.
[19:36:45] <Julian> so rather than doing anything globally, try to push all that down into your main
[19:36:52] <Julian> and then in your tests don't invoke that
[19:38:14] <mrproper> Hmmm...my application actually doesn't have a `main()` since it's using FastAPI. I'll need to look into how to restructure it to do that.
[19:39:05] <Julian> I haven't used FastAPI but it undoubtedly will have a factory function thing

[19:42:21] <Julian> mrproper: here probably -- https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/ -- use routers instead of a global FastAPI instance, and then do `def create_app(): add_all_the_routers_and_return_a_fastapi_instance`
[19:42:27] <Julian> mrproper: pytest won't do anything you don't tell it to do
[19:42:36] <Julian> so if you don't define any tests that fully call your create_app function it won't call it

[19:44:47] <mrproper> I'm still new to a lot of this stuff so I want to do it properly if I can and better understand the structure.
[19:46:16] <Julian> mrproper: definitely -- essentially avoid letting things mutate global state, what datadog recommends you do is for "convenience" for someone to get off the ground, but it creates testing annoyances and harms your code being usable as a library, say
[19:46:24] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[19:46:49] <Julian> so as much as you can, it's good to centralize that kind of change-the-world into a function that's very specific to you running your web app "for real in production", and then tests can avoid that
[19:46:59] <mrproper> Julian: And as of now, I'm using a single file instead of the router setup. But that's been on my to do to migrate to anyways.

[21:20:34] <supakeen> Yea, toml is a better choice than ini which is ehhh a bit weird but having everything depend on it and especially the current state of `toml` vs `tomli` is annoying.
[21:20:34] <jinsun> cargo uses toml too
[21:20:42] <grym> ini has a spec the way that csv has a spec, which means that lots of people have sure made a lot of text files over the years

I'm currently trying fetchall and  list3 = [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]. I know this is mostly a computer science problem rather than Python, but is there a better

[21:25:02] <phy1729> Is there a nice way with fastapi and pydantic to say interally I want to deal with X type, but externally serialize to Y. E.g. I have a enum.Flag that I want the API to be a list of strings (the names of the Flag members), but in the code I want to deal with the Flag object.
[21:25:34] <grym> phy1729: yes, `class MyEnum(str, Enum):`
[21:25:40] <stwange> deniska, I think it's at the point where a stupid implementation by me takes noticeably longer, where you'd get away with it with smaller datasets

[23:14:04] <SnoopJ> henistein, using that structure, you have to scan over possibly every room, testing (x, y) against the room definition (it isn't clear if your coordinates are a corner + width/height, or two corners...). An ordered structure would be able to do better, though.

[23:41:48] <teut> if the message sending fails by any reason, then I just want it to continue
[23:42:04] <Helenah> Ah right.
[23:42:09] <teut> so that only one line is missing but rest of the things work
[23:42:12] <Helenah> 1min I'm opening you code.
[23:42:19] <teut> sure

[23:43:20] <Helenah> teut, What Exception are you expecting to handle?
[23:43:24] *** Joins: EGH (~EGH@185.25.195.104)
[23:43:41] <Helenah> Being general with an except: isn't good unless you absolutely know you will only ever get the same exception.
[23:43:49] *** Quits: nepeat (~nepeat@79.110.170.59) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:44:00] <teut> I want that if any exceptions happens silent failure should be there
[23:44:03] <Helenah> Because you can end up with another exception that's now hidden and be unaware.
[23:44:24] <Helenah> teut, Instead do except Exception as e:
[23:44:27] <teut> but at many places as you can see I am sending a message back too at discord
[23:44:33] <Helenah> e will contain the exception
[23:44:53] <teut> yes , thats right, but I am not using e
[23:45:11] <Helenah> And if you were soo inclined you can test e within the except to treat it further.
[23:45:13] <teut> you mean yield e? or return e?
[23:45:25] <Helenah> That'll work
[23:45:39] <teut> i can try that , thanks

[23:49:25] <Helenah> They are but I don't think just dismissing them with "pass" is a good idea. You can always test the content of e to see if it equates to something you want to pass without passing everything else.

[23:51:25] <teut> and it didnt give me error
[23:51:27] <Helenah> Well get_paragraph returns a list.
[23:51:46] <Repiphany> Unhandled or ignored exceptions suggest you don't understand what your code is doing or why it fails

[23:52:03] <teut> just overwrote it
[23:52:03] <Helenah> If I remember correctly an empty list will be False which means it can be tested with "if not" to see if it's empty or "if" to see if it's full.
[23:52:31] <teut> Repiphany , the code has a hundred reasons to fails
[23:52:51] <teut> like I said , I need to do quick dirty work
[23:53:03] *** Joins: seoul_man (~meh@user/seoul-man/x-5066766)
[23:53:05] <Helenah> Meaning that if a list doesn't get returned you can test "if list" and then under that "for i in list"

[23:53:53] <Helenah> teut, Just make sure you clean it all up if you ever plan on releasing to the public.
[23:54:19] <Repiphany> If your code has a hundred ways of failing, you're putting a `try: except` in a bad place
[23:55:16] <Repiphany> The earlier you handle possible exceptions the easier time you'll have for quick dirty work
[23:55:28] <Helenah> Repiphany, has a point

[23:55:39] <Helenah> try should test as little within it as possible.
[23:56:35] <teut> yes , I will make it better , much better if I will be releasing it for public.
[23:56:41] <Helenah> The unfortunate thing with coding that I have to do is put try's and except's everywhere and many except's to a try, it really is difficult once you used to doing it.
[23:56:59] <teut> for such a system the chain of responsibilities design pattern is good to use

[23:58:05] <teut> it isn't?
[23:58:39] <Helenah> teut, Even for just yourself it's beneficial, I've not ran a program for a while, needed to run it and BAM an error when not expected, when didn't happen before, got taken by surprise.
[23:58:49] <Helenah> I was using RegEx to correct an error in what I said.
[23:58:59] <SnoopJ> Helenah, the `rich` library is also popular for building TUIs these days, but I've never used it myself
[23:59:49] <teut> yes I know , regex code require lots of unit test
