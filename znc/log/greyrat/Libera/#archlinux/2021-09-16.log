[00:02:18] <demonicmaniac> if it ever does get filled it will block until flushed so instead of microstutters it would be one large stutter
[00:02:30] <demonicmaniac> ratio OR bytes

[01:20:12] <cq-work> conan is a C++ dependency manager.
[01:20:14] <coruja> aur still has it
[01:20:21] <cq-work> It's used to build other packages more than likely.
[01:20:39] <cq-work> So it's likely you built an AUR package that used it then didn't uninstall it.

[03:35:40] <thurstylark> (I mean, unless NM pulls that kind of stuff in on its own or something)

[05:27:28] <harovali> hi, I'm in need to touch some .py source files of an installed arch package, and then have the .pyc files recompiled (which live in a subordinated directory /usr/lib/python3.9/idlelib/__pycache__. I tryied to force the .pyc file regeneration by running the modified debugger.py  in /usr/lib/python3.9/idlelib/ . However  the corresponding debugger.pyc does not appear updated in the ls -lt ./__pycache__  .   Any kind hint ?

[07:09:40] <sheep> mefistofeles: yes, or you need some other way to run your bootloader off of the EFI System partition and load the kernel and initramfs. Grub does support LVM and LUKS, but it's annoying to set up. Another option is using y\our EFI System partition as /boot
[07:10:00] <mefistofeles> sheep: yes, the latter is what I was thinking

[13:57:36] <th0rne> I think Sony had some bluetooth headphones where if you hold your hand against the headphone, it mutes it. I thought it was a cool feature - not only is it quick and easy to slap the headphone if someone starts talking to you, but then they also get visual confirmation that you can hear them.

[16:27:43] <PMunch> pulse
[16:28:04] <kib> first thing I'd do is install pipewie and pipewire-pulse and reboot and try again.
[16:28:54] <PMunch> Sounds sensible
[16:29:24] <grawity> well, no, that's not the kind of problem that pulseaudio normally has
[16:29:38] <kib> note that pipewire-pulse will remove pulseaudio
[16:29:44] <PMunch> But it only happens if I have played audio
[16:29:57] <kib> seems like pulse being pulse to me :D
[16:30:05] <PMunch> Before I have started playing audio it doesn't appear to freeze
[16:30:09] <B4ckBOne> I have browser freezes with pipewire ina Vmware VM (Fedora)
[16:30:11] <kib> this is honestly the easiest first step and probably will work
[16:30:18] <B4ckBOne> So i replaced pipewire with pulseaudio
[16:30:25] <B4ckBOne> Problem solved.

[19:28:50] <krin> Hi. I'm trying to see if anyone can point me in the right direction of getting GPU scaling from the nouveau driver. With nvidia proprietary driver I can set viewportin in the metamodes option in the Xorg.conf. My monitor only supports 4k and 1080p and I'd like to use 1440p scaled up by the GPU as the Xft.dpi setting isn't...working great. I'm also really confused by the Display Size and DPI section on the Xorg page of the wiki. Lol.

[21:03:44] <kuhilas> I installed firefox since a video player has been acting up on this one website. Now on firefox I don't have audio at all and did a quick search and found someone mentioning that firefox uses pulseaudio. I don't have that. I had some audio problems on my TV+monitor setup and I wouldn't want to install pulseaudio into the mix since I have been happy just having alsa so far, is there anything I can do
[21:04:16] <thursdaylark> Firefox uses pulse exclusively iirc
[21:04:17] <drop> mefistofeles: I'm pretty sure it's possible. Have you looked at the Wiki page? Foxboron also dabbles into secureboot a bit I think. https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl
[21:04:35] <thursdaylark> unless that's changed since pipewire started hanging around :P
[21:04:57] <mefistofeles> I mean, I won't be booting the other OS in this machine much, so I guess it's "ok" to disable secure boot and just enable in case I need to boot the other OS
[21:05:01] <mefistofeles> but was just wondering
[21:05:15] <kuhilas> hmm ok. I have been using qutebrowser, and wouldn't want to install chrome. I wonder if there is another browser that wouldn't use pulse exclusively that I could try
[21:05:18] <icar> thursdaylark: `sudo --preserve-env=DIFFPROG pacdiff` worked. I don't understand why, tho.
[21:05:42] <coruja> kuhilas: arch's firefox comes with alsa support
[21:05:43] <thursdaylark> huh
[21:06:02] <AntiComposite> mefistofeles, That's only if you decide to replace the OEM keys with your own. Most of the time you don't need to do that, and can use a signed boot loader instead

[22:21:34] <Shapeshifter> Is it considered normal that if I don't upgrade in a while, doing pacman -Syu will give a bunch of "pkg.tar.zst is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).' errors? I usually have to run pacman -S archlinux-keyring first, then upgrade the rest. This normal?

[22:24:22] <thursdaylark> there's a larger conversation going on about this issue

[22:29:28] <Shapeshifter> gehidore: I don't think that's a great assumption. It prettu much precludes that Arch is an unsuitable distro for machines that are turned off for a few weeks/months at a time.
[22:29:38] <Hydragyrum> yeah there's something about the "daily pacman -Syu"...
[22:29:49] *** Joins: barbarossa93 (~barbaross@c-73-39-107-44.hsd1.md.comcast.net)
[22:29:59] <Shapeshifter> Shouldn't the package manager be able to upgrade from 'any' older version?
[22:30:14] <thursdaylark> it is
[22:30:19] <Shapeshifter> especially for something so trivial as package signing
[22:30:24] <Hydragyrum> it's not surprising that that's not the common, trivial usecase
[22:30:49] <thursdaylark> the keyring issue is a long-standing known issue that requires a lot of infra changes to replace
[22:30:52] <mefistofeles> ok, damn, I'm so slow with this, but I'm noticing my wlan0 device/interface is a thing with the arch live iso but not in the installed arch, what should I look for there? What module or package?
[22:30:54] <Shapeshifter> huh.
[22:30:55] <Hydragyrum> if you update a debian machine after months or years, there's a good chance you'll be on oldoldstable instead
[22:30:56] <thursdaylark> shit's gonna be slow to get fixed
[22:31:13] <Hydragyrum> and changing between suites on those is a pain
[22:31:39] <thursdaylark> mefistofeles: `lsusb -t` if your wifi module is on usb, and `lspci -k` if it's on pci
[22:32:03] <mefistofeles> thursdaylark: it is pci, I do see the iwlwifi using it, also the wl, I think the `wl` is the one missing in the installed arch

[22:33:52] <DigitalKiwi> Shapeshifter: i remember when pacman didn't even have signing and nobody wanted to implement it lol

[22:35:16] <thursdaylark> mefistofeles: does it show up in `lspci`?
[22:35:18] <coruja> ok, i put i another way, no upgrades for _years_ isn't a good idea for any linux distribution/operating system
[22:35:19] <mefistofeles> it probably needs some firmware or something like that, now that I think about it
