[14:00:13] <_inky> so busy, cannot connect and talk, i have a debt about modules. my favourite topic.
[14:00:51] <_inky> i have two jobs, the second is teaching, and it takes too many resources. this night i was preparing and drawing, what i'd like to draw on a board, with different colours.
[14:01:28] <_inky> but i love this teaching job. i spend most resources there, but i enjoy it.
[14:01:33] <_inky> industry is not as interesting.
[14:01:36] <_inky> and i guess i'll have to take the third job, because i live in a third country and it's hard.
[14:02:51] <_inky> and i am not someone who has big appetites, who wants a good car, or wants to travel. i accepted i won't travel, and i have a 20 years old car which works, and i don't want even to think of changing it.
[14:04:34] <_inky> still better than 20 years ago, when i was getting $80 per month.
[14:05:34] <_inky> on modules, i already have the example. the example on why headers suck, and why namespaces don't solve all the problems.
[14:06:03] <_inky> but i have a call in 25 minutes, hopefully will have time to go bring me a cup of tea before it.

[15:16:01] <Joanna> Hi mosasaur welcome
[15:16:59] <Joanna> _inky: I think there are two types of materialism there is the keeping up with the Jones‚Äôs and buying things you don‚Äôt need to impress people you don‚Äôt like
[15:17:41] <Joanna> Then there is the desire to just stockpile things that might be useful in the future
[15:21:44] <Joanna> You definitely aren‚Äôt the keep up with joneses type :)
[15:27:06] <mosasaur> employment is slavery
[15:29:57] <_inky> Joanna: i love tools, and i only buy tools, and i use them. those are often very cheap. i was buying cheap film cameras, or cheap expired film. now it's impossible, prices are high. and i bought pinephone and pinebook. both are cheap - pinephone costs $150, pinebook $200. pinebook - because it's the best laptop, it has only 4gb of ram, but i love it, and i don't need anything more powerful. i open terminals, vim, and work like that.
[15:30:01] <_inky> and we come to opsec. (:
[15:30:12] <_inky> before turning on the pinephone for the first time, i disabled its modem.
[15:30:22] <_inky> so i never use the modem.
[15:30:37] <_inky> it has hardware switches to disable components like modem, bt, wifi, mic.
[15:31:02] <_inky> also the chipset has sort of backdoors but they need dedicated proprietary software to work, so nothing in hardware that can spy on you.
[15:31:31] <_inky> all the people with modern intel chipsets have intel management engine with minix preinstalled. (:
[15:42:40] <Joanna> mosasaur: what do you do for a living?
[15:44:37] <Joanna> _inky: the frustrating thing for me is the way things are designed designed to break on purpose.
[15:45:04] <Joanna> Or become unusable
[15:45:12] <jan6> good thing I've not encountered it
[15:45:24] <jan6> prolly cause I'm not in $big_country
[15:45:25] <jan6> lol
[15:46:25] <mosasaur> Joanna: that question conflicts with my opsec :)
[15:48:08] <Joanna> Well if it‚Äôs slavery I get all sorts of Ideas about people toiling in the hot sun wearing loincloths with someone nearby cracking a whip and I doubt you would be here if that was the case :)
[15:49:19] <Joanna> jan6: not encountered what ?
[15:49:27] <jan6> obsolecence
[15:49:44] <Joanna> I thought it was universal by now..
[15:50:38] <Joanna> mosasaur: if you are so worried about opsec why reveal that employment is slavery?
[15:51:06] <Joanna> You have already told us quite a lot with that single statement..
[15:51:55] <jan6> all my phones have surivived like, well about 3-4 years (and are mostly fine hardware-wise), at which point it's probably time to upgrade anyway, for all the fancy new features, cheap-ass kettle, fine too, usb drives, fine too, old laptop, has only some age difficulty (2013 thinkpad's fan grease's dried up or such), digital watch, survived for many years, too, cups 'n bowls, no issues

[15:52:15] <jan6> key problem with that statement is generalization
[15:52:18] <jan6> just like "acab"
[15:52:34] <jan6> there's plenty of jobs which aren't abusive

[15:53:02] <Joanna> There has been slavery since the beginning of human history. Often people who lost wars and their descendants
[15:53:20] <jan6> slavery is a strong word, too
[15:53:42] <Joanna> Slavery = involuntary servitude
[15:54:06] <jan6> "The condition in which one person is owned as property by another and is under the owner's control, especially in involuntary servitude."
[15:54:13] <jan6> it is much more than servitude
[15:54:23] <jan6> which is my problem with the word ;P
[15:54:31] <Joanna> If you must be employed to not starve to death outdoors it‚Äôs not very voluntary
[15:55:11] *** Joins: inky (~inky@31.7.162.99)
[15:55:32] <Joanna> Most people must get permission to travel from government right ?
[15:55:34] <jan6> you can be self-employed, or do part-time jobs which would barely qualify as employement
[15:56:28] <Joanna> jan6: sure there are ways to get a better life if you have the know how and opportunity or pick the correct parents :)
[15:56:44] <jan6> parents don't matter much
[15:57:06] <jan6> well, they matter much in early years, but not in the rest of life past early 20s
[15:57:41] <jan6> if you illegally cross borders, if you're not wanted by law enforcement, most likely nobody cares about that, either
[15:57:55] <Joanna> Your parents determine your entire future pretty much.
[15:58:09] <jan6> not really
[15:58:26] <jan6> they determine the initial starting opportunities and initial path
[15:59:06] <jan6> but you can become totally different, you can start out with rich and respected parents, and end up as a bum, you can start out with abusive alcoholics in a slum, and become a millionaire
[15:59:09] <Joanna> The things that happen when you are a child determine your future. I can say from experience that schools I. Rich neighborhoods are a lot different than those in poor neighborhoods.
[15:59:56] <jan6> the early life very much affects your personality and worldview, but it doesn't DETERMINE anything
[15:59:57] <Joanna> You can have rich abusive parents that give the family fortune to one of your siblings.
[16:00:04] <jan6> sure
[16:00:57] <Joanna> Ideas you get in early life affect decisions made later .
[16:01:02] <jan6> sure
[16:01:06] <jan6> but they don't determine them
[16:01:10] <Joanna> For got or bad
[16:01:16] <Joanna> Good
[16:02:00] <jan6> if you don't always think inside the box, and are a little creative, there's a million ways to achieve anything
[16:02:06] <Joanna> As I‚Äôve said before I don‚Äôt really think people have control over the decisions they make.
[16:02:24] <jan6> it's easier to not control your decisions
[16:02:30] <jan6> it's easier to let them control you
[16:02:31] <Joanna> Most people aren‚Äôt that creative they just copy.
[16:02:34] <jan6> it's easiest to go with the flow
[16:02:57] <jan6> if you know what parts to copy where, and how, then it doesn't matter
[16:03:03] <jan6> creativity is different from originality
[16:03:53] <Joanna> I like to improve which is a form of copying I suppose
[16:04:05] <jan6> depends how you do it ;P
[16:04:21] <jan6> but not really copying, imho
[16:04:31] <Joanna> Evolution is improving things to be better
[16:04:44] <mosasaur> I've been watching marvel's "the gifted". One theory offered by law enforcement in there is neanderthals had better genes and a bigger brain, yet they lost to humans because humans cooperate better, but that is a trade-of with personal freedom
[16:05:15] <jan6> I prefer the hitchiker's guide explanation better
[16:05:16] <jan6> lol
[16:05:21] <Joanna> Humans greatest strength is definitely working together.
[16:06:05] <jan6> original humans were nice and kept to themselves, but then middle-class-aliens ended up here, and broke everything
[16:06:11] <jan6> lol
[16:06:37] <Joanna> Unfortunately it‚Äôs also a great weakness which gets a lot of people killed when they follow the wrong leaders..
[16:08:10] <Joanna> Do you ever ponder about war. When thousands of guys go at it and die horrible violent deaths. It‚Äôs no secret what war is yet humans find it irresistible...
[16:08:33] <mosasaur> oh right, neandertals were humans too
[16:08:39] <Joanna> It‚Äôs like they keep forgetting about the violent death part of it.
[16:08:51] <_inky> Joanna: i don't ponder, i live in it.
[16:08:59] <_inky> well almost.
[16:09:09] <_inky> we had 4000 dead in 40 days just a year ago.
[16:09:18] <_inky> and in Nov 16, again, not known amount of dead.
[16:09:21] <_inky> on the border.
[16:09:22] <jan6> who cares,just make another crusade

[16:09:54] <Joanna> I sometimes watch samurai movies and that is really something to actually think of what fighting someone with a sword would be like.
[16:10:37] <Joanna> _inky: why did so many die were they out numbered or ?
[16:10:43] <_inky> i just cannot do that. since early childhood i noticed i can get angry, i can hit, but then i feel terrible about it. so i cannot use a sword.
[16:11:02] <_inky> Joanna: modern war technologies, and oil money.
[16:11:08] <_inky> control of the skies.
[16:11:35] <Joanna> But to think people could fight with swords without being terrified .. thats really something.
[16:11:47] <_inky> the enemy had modern drones and controlled the sky. that was very important. you know, people can be brave, when they see the enemy, but they were dying even without knowing why, and without seeing anything.
[16:12:23] <_inky> they bought weapons for about 20 billions of dollars.
[16:12:40] <_inky> we had bought weapons for less than a billion in 20 years, i think.
[16:12:53] <jan6> a good strategy would be to not hurt humans, but hurt their equipement instead
[16:12:55] <_inky> also, soviet school of military vs western.
[16:13:17] <Joanna> I‚Äôve seen situations where smaller more organized forces could win battles where they were vastly out numbered. But the people with best technology definitely win easier.
[16:13:39] <_inky> they also hurt civilians, that was very important for them, to make panic. which they achieved to some extent.
[16:13:55] <jan6> knowing your enemy, and your area, are pretty important for winning when outnumbered
[16:14:21] <jan6> otherwise, yeah, "magic death from the sky"
[16:14:24] <Joanna> And being well organized

[16:14:57] <jan6> lol
[16:15:03] <jan6> why bother, it's all the same
[16:15:36] <_inky> but i would say the other problem was that our corrupted gov didn't want to settle this peacefully back 20 years ago. with painful price, but it was possible. then the moment was lost about afer 97.
[16:16:36] <Joanna> I think many places are ill equipped for war
[16:16:55] <_inky> what i say it is not a popular opinion, because the same corrupted gov, in order to stay in power, was blaming each and every opposition force that they want to 'sell the land', while they, they are the purity. actually what they did was they were negotiating about piece, but in secret, and was afraid to get the agreement.
[16:17:16] <_inky> because they already washed heads of people that they aren't negotiating.
[16:17:29] <jan6> 14:46 <Joanna> I think many places are ill equipped for war

[16:17:46] <jan6> more correct: ALL places not full of crazy militant people, are ill equipped for war

[16:20:34] <_inky> 'they' had rallies demanding the war. so it had to start. in part our fault. it was possible to settle it down on understandable conditions in 97, not later. later, they just demanded everything as they want, because they knew they have money and they can create better military by having good allies. we never had a good alley. actually, i would say we are not an alley, we are the hostage.

[16:21:35] <Joanna> Is Russia involved?
[16:25:27] <Joanna> jan6: I think most people just assume their government will rescue them .. I remember hurricane Katrina where people were just abandoned there..

[16:28:04] *** Joins: phenom (~primus@user/phenom)
[16:28:37] <_inky> my understanding is, that russia keeps us as hostages. it doesn't like to have allies. it likes to pressure everyone and force what they want. well, all big countries do.
[16:28:45] <_inky> on the paper we are allies. they sell weapons to both sides.
[16:29:14] <_inky> only one year they sold weapons for 5 or 6 billions only. to the enemy of their 'ally'.
[16:29:34] <Joanna> It‚Äôs easier to believe that there are contingency plans and safeguards when there really aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like a story a ww2 veteran once told about how silk parachutes were stolen and replaced by rags and this wasn‚Äôt discovered until they were used...
[16:29:36] <_inky> so they wanted the war to start, and they wanted us to be humiliated and even more dependent on them. actually they wanted both sides to be dependent.

[16:30:01] *** Quits: sn1tch3r (~sn1tch3r@user/sn1tch3r) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:30:37] <_inky> so right now, we have the incursion, and about 40 square kms occupied, and theoretically we are in that russia's lead nato like structure, and because our army is almost nonexistent now, we had sent them written requests, but they ignore those.
[16:30:52] <Joanna> _inky: so it‚Äôs sort of a war to weaken both sides like iran Iraq war ?
[16:31:02] <_inky> thankfully, yes, they stopped the war again. but on the positions - who stays where.
[16:31:12] <_inky> so the losses we got nobody will compensate.
[16:31:21] <_inky> very much like that, yes, i guess.
[16:32:32] <Joanna> So you were being attacked by russian made weapons?
[16:33:59] <_inky> yes, russian, israeli and turkish. a bit chinese.
[16:34:17] <_inky> we only had russian air defence systems which were useless against israely and turkish drones.
[16:34:18] <Joanna> Didn‚Äôt you say you lost because your government was corrupt before . And stole the money?
[16:34:32] <_inky> i mean, yes, that is also important. but i would say more
[16:34:51] <_inky> we lost because the government did not want to settle this down.
[16:34:55] <_inky> so ok in very short.
[16:35:05] <_inky> because you know, if you don't have war, you cannot loose.
[16:35:13] <_inky> so they didn't do anything to prevent it.
[16:35:14] *** Joins: elkclone (~elkclone@user/elkclone)
[16:35:18] <_inky> that's what i was saying.
[16:35:27] <_inky> ok in very short.
[16:35:34] <Joanna> What should they have done?
[16:35:44] <_inky> in very short, i hope i can do that.
[16:35:58] <_inky> late 80ies, gorbachev allows sort of freedom of speech.
[16:36:23] <_inky> i believe what i'll say won't be subjective, i'll try to draw the picture which is objective for both sides.
[16:36:56] <_inky> well ok lets go back in time to early 20th century then.
[16:37:41] <Joanna> You were part of ussr
[16:39:09] <_inky> i think last independent armenian state was in 16th century. not here, last independent armenian state here was in 12th century. but the other state, the last was where today some part of lebanon and turkey.
[16:39:17] <_inky> then we were under persian or russian rule.
[16:39:25] <_inky> or turkish.
[16:40:05] <Joanna> It seems like your country is small and gets attacked a lot. It‚Äôs amazing it still exists.
[16:40:39] <_inky> many remember the old great and big armenia, but i think it only harms. the reality is that yes, it's amazing it still exists.
[16:40:45] <_inky> early 20th century, revolution in russia, south caucasus was inhabited mostly by three ethnicities - georgians, armenians and turkic speaking people described in russian papers as 'tatars'. they were under persian influence, so their religion is shia, not like in turkey.
[16:41:01] <_inky> everybody starts to fight with everybody because they need to decide about their borders.
[16:41:17] <_inky> before that in 1915 most of the armenian in ottoman empire were killed.
[16:41:37] <_inky> so some fled to lebanon, syria, some to europe, some to the russian part.
[16:41:50] <_inky> so the first republic was full of refugees, and there was hunger, etc.
[16:41:55] <Joanna> What destroyed Ottoman Empire?
[16:42:08] <_inky> they lost in first world war.
[16:42:12] <_inky> together with germany.
[16:42:31] <_inky> so usa president wilson decided to have a fair map of the region, and had drawn pretty big map of armenia.
[16:42:44] <_inky> with access to the sea. to not have humiliated people in the region,
[16:42:46] <Joanna> Oh that ruined their whole empire?
[16:42:59] <_inky> well, yes. palestine also belonged to them.
[16:43:03] <_inky> they were huge.
[16:43:35] <Joanna> So the british probably helped destroy the empire
[16:43:36] <_inky> but the american map was never destined to become a reality, because why would it? it was just a project.
[16:43:48] <_inky> yes. and british were here, had the mandate for some time.
[16:44:07] <_inky> so there was no United Nations, there was Liga of Nations back then.
[16:44:21] <_inky> it recognized three states: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
[16:45:10] <Joanna> Didn‚Äôt the ottomans not like Armenians because they were allied with Russia?
[16:45:17] <_inky> in part yes.
[16:45:47] <_inky> in part because they were christians, and as i understand in Ottoman empire there was no such a problem with ethnicities, as with religions.
[16:46:07] <_inky> some armenians converted to islam, so there are a couple of villages there with them till these days.
[16:46:15] <Joanna> It seems like most of countries in world are controlled by same people
[16:46:23] <_inky> heh.
[16:46:50] <_inky> so, armenians in russia lived a bit better, and a bit better in Iran. in Turkey they did not have right to have a horse, or to have a two floor house, etc.
[16:46:55] <_inky> it was a religious thing.
[16:47:15] <_inky> so they dreamed of more fair turkey, and had a couple of leftist parties.
[16:47:40] <_inky> leftist parties were dreaming not about the independence of armenia, but about more fair regime in turkey, so that all ethnicities will have equal rights.
[16:47:57] <Joanna> So the Iranians didn‚Äôt mind the Armenians going there? Did they change religion?
[16:48:20] <_inky> iranians and armenians are historically very good with each other.
[16:48:48] <_inky> the king who forced christianity here, was actually ethnicly persian.
[16:48:50] <jan6> #politix
[16:48:51] <jan6> lol
[16:49:03] <_inky> but after the defeat in first world war  turkey needed to blame someone.
[16:49:24] <_inky> and it was armenians, greeks, and assyrians: christians.
[16:50:07] <_inky> so they eliminated greeks, assyrians and armenians. according to different numbers, about 800.000 - 1.5 million of armenians were killed there. my grandfather is genocide survivor.
[16:51:16] <_inky> later after revolution in russia, three states emerged: Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan. Armenians like to say that Azerbaijan is actually a name of the Iranian province. But it was already populated by Turkic speaking shias, so probably the founders of the countly had a  thought of reuting with them in the future.
[16:51:51] <_inky> western border was established by British. Not what we were dreaming of, not the map of Wilson, but not bad. not as bad as today.
[16:52:08] <_inky> With Georgia we're always been good. Small problems, but nothing serious.
[16:52:32] <Joanna> It seems like history is endless war and plundering..
[16:52:33] <_inky> And there are a lot of Armenians living there, no problems. They aren't getting pressured. They are citizens like Georgians.
[16:52:35] *** Joins: chromis (sid150893@tinside.irccloud.com)
[16:53:08] <Joanna> Hi chromis welcome
[16:53:11] <_inky> so we never had any problems with Georgia, actually. We even had a common kingdom for some time, and were fighting Turks in 12-13th century  together.
[16:53:58] <_inky> so eastern border was never established, because it was a war with Azerbaijan because of it. There was an area populated with Armenians, and they didn't want to stay under a control of a Turkic speaking country.
[16:54:25] <_inky> then the actual Turkey also started the war, then also Bolsheviks come from the North.
[16:54:46] <_inky> So we were fighting three powers, on the West - Turkey, on the East Azeris, on the North - Russia.
[16:55:03] <_inky> So at the time Russia invaded us again, we lost most of the land to Turkey. (:
[16:55:18] <Joanna> I‚Äôm surprised the ussr didn‚Äôt mix the population together to into one country.
[16:55:32] <_inky> they tried, but were not successful always.
[16:56:37] <_inky> minute, i'll be back.
[16:56:39] <_inky> in a minute.
[16:56:43] <Joanna> It sounds precarious I hope you don‚Äôt get more war there
[16:59:06] <Joanna> I go afk
[16:59:33] <jan6> 12:30 <_inky> so busy, cannot connect and talk
[16:59:47] <jan6> _inky then proceeds to chat for 3 hours
[17:00:08] <_inky> jan6: yes, exactly. sometimes it is hard to resist.
[17:00:14] <_inky> when Joanna asks such questions.
[17:00:32] <_inky> i'll pay for it by working in the night.
[17:01:02] <_inky> so, Russia invades everyone. decides on new western border, decides on new eastern border, integrates everyone in to USSR.
[17:01:03] <jan6> me_irl when I say I have to sleep, at midnight
[17:01:03] <jan6> lol
[17:01:07] <_inky> (:
[17:01:51] <_inky> it was painful defeat here, but understandable.
[17:02:02] <_inky> so the problem with small countries, you need to learn that you never get what you want.
[17:02:23] <_inky> you should decide - do you want to cut your arm yourself or you want others to come and cut your legs?
[17:02:38] <_inky> and it is hard to understand to people who didn't have state for centuries.
[17:03:08] <_inky> so the good strategy was just instead of fighting with Russians to acknowledge the defeat with them as early as possible.
[17:03:15] <_inky> to have more land controlled by us, not by Turkey.
[17:03:36] <_inky> that's weird but that's what they had to do.
[17:03:55] <_inky> we woud be integrated in USSR with better borders on better deals.
[17:05:41] <_inky> so... two parts were given to the other country, to the Azerbaijan. One had about 50% armenian population, but was controlled by at the moment of defeat. other was partly controlled by us, partly by them. At the end of USSR, in 80ies, that first part didn't almost have any Armenians left. but the other regios was still mostly populated by armenians. So when Gorbachov announced freedom of speech, they believed it, and started rallies by ap
[17:05:42] <_inky> pealing to communist party to reunite them with Armenia.
[17:06:33] <_inky> inside the ussr there were many such deals, Crimea was given to Ukraine, there was something like that in Middle Asia, so they thought - why not?
[17:07:12] <_inky> also they claimed the area is economically not developed because to Azerbaijan it doesn't make sense to develop the area populated by Armenians, and i think they were mostly right.
[17:07:45] <_inky> so this started ethnic cleansings of Armenians there, even during the USSR rule.
[17:07:53] <_inky> pogroms in two major cities.
[17:07:55] <_inky> i tried to be short.
[17:08:20] <_inky> then Soviet Army entered their capital, and was shooting everyone they could see, on third day of Armenian pogroms.
[17:08:38] <_inky> it is a black day in Azeri history, because Soviet army killed many innocent people.
[17:08:57] <_inky> But they needed to react somehow, they were already late. This is already 1990.
[17:09:14] <_inky> then Soviet Army together with Azeri militia depopulates those Armenian villages.
[17:09:23] <_inky> well, Soviets didn't even understand what they are doing.
[17:09:58] <_inky> Azeri side told them 'there are terrorists, they have arms', so Soviet army came and collegted the arms. And later, without the arms nobody would wait for Azeri militia to come and kill them unarmed, they just left.
[17:10:14] <_inky> then USSR collapsed and the wide scale war started.
[17:10:25] <_inky> it ended in 1994 with the ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia.
[17:10:50] <_inky> at that moment Armenians gained a bit more than they wanted, and Azeris had about half a million refugees, as they say, and i think it is mostly true.
[17:11:01] <_inky> So they started negotiations. 
[17:11:30] <_inky> And international community pressure was big, and our leader soon realized it is not possible to get the status of independence for that break away region.
[17:12:00] <_inky> and we were blocked, at that time, till now, of course by Turkey as well, so no routes.
[17:12:42] <_inky> the solution proposed was: our military leaves the land surrounding the breakaway region, leaves the regios as well. russian peacekeepers come.
[17:12:48] <_inky> the status is discussed later.
[17:12:58] <_inky> that was a peaceful solution we could achieve in 1997.
[17:13:30] <_inky> but instead the military elite plus prime minister who came from that break away region, made a palace coup, and we lost the chance of peace.
[17:14:46] <_inky> then they were collecting money, they had oil, they had support of Turkey, they bought weapons, they trained good military, and got everything back, and now want something more from us.
[17:14:48] <_inky> that's in short.
[17:14:49] <_inky> sorry.
[17:14:58] <_inky> i need to work with someone now.
[17:15:00] <_inky> afk.
[17:26:51] <mosasaur> just never marry, so you stay mobile
