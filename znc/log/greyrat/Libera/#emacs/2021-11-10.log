[00:24:36] <thblt> That bot is awfully silent. 
[00:24:40] <rudybot> hodapp: What you want is called "docstrings" in most Lisp's, but Googling for "Racket docstrings" (without the outer quotes) only shows people saying it doesn't exist, so I'm guessing it's only literate programming style. I think the argument for literate programming is it lets you include graphics and fancy formatting you can't get in just ASCII.

[04:13:30] <Bayes> I like writing commit titles as sentences starting with a verb, and also have a couple keywords that I tend to grep like "Beautify" commits, so "Hot fix ..." might be one of those new keywords
[04:14:26] <Catie> I like to do the same thing, but it can be hard when there's not really a single "theme" to your commit, it's just a bunch of stuff. I'm very guilty of writing many paragraphs in my commit messages

[04:22:20] <bpalmer> edrx: see (info "(cl) Structures")
[04:22:55] <aidalgol> At my job, most devs write commit messages as a single-line paragraph, and it displays horribly in most UIs.
[04:23:17] <aidalgol> And then my nicely-formatted commit messages get mangled by Atlassian's shitty tools, because those people can't code for shit.
[04:23:20] <bpalmer> edrx: but at its core,  (cl-defstruct person name age sex) is a macro that creates a bunch of functions for you: make-person will create a record of that type; it takes each field as a keyword

[04:24:56] <bpalmer> so, (let ((p (make-person :name "john doe" :age 20 :sex "male"))) ...) ; it defines a few functions #'person-age, #'person-sex, and #'person-name that are getters; it defines setf forms for them (so you can do (cl-setf (person-age p) 25)  to mutate an existing record)

[04:25:50] <bpalmer> edrx: and , lastly, it defines a type predicate function #'person-p  that you can use to see if a value is a record of that type.
[04:25:59] <edrx> bpalmer: aaaah, I missed the cl-setf trick the last time! and that's what makes structs practical to use...
[04:26:09] <edrx> great, thanks =)
[04:26:33] <aidalgol> Catie: They are shit, and their support is shit.
[04:27:08] <aidalgol> On top of being generally terrible, they don't even have consistent UI design across their products.
[04:27:19] <Catie> I mean no surprise on that one, commercial support on software -- in my experience -- has never been even remotely helpful
[04:27:26] <bpalmer> edrx: there's nothing particularly magic about it; you could write your own macro, but it does serve as a quick and simple documentation that every person is supposed to have 3 bits of information.

[04:30:53] <aidalgol> grym: It also abuses the hell out of session data.
[04:31:17] <aidalgol> e.g. search queries aren't in the GET request; they're in the session data.

[04:34:22] <Catie> grym: oh I feel this in my soul
[04:35:40] <xrogaan> so, using vim there are quick and useful shortcuts. Like using `/` to initialize a search, or typing `:n` to go to a specific line number. Is there some way to gain a similar behavior with emacs? So far, the searching has left me clueless (as how to do it) and to go to a line number is just a pointlessly long chain of keys to type.

[04:37:00] <aidalgol> Catie: OOC, have you only recently got into Emacs, or only recently discovered its insane IRC community?
[04:37:01] <technomancy> jira has an almost-ok CLI
[04:37:02] <xrogaan> edrx: that's way too long.
[04:37:04] <Catie> xrogaan: the two answers are: yes it's very possible, but you'll have to do some serious customizing, maybe check out evil-mode; and yeah it's possible but you can also just learn the bindings
[04:37:07] <grym> technomancy: _where_
[04:37:13] <aidalgol> technomancy: Your standards must be slipping. :P
[04:37:18] <xrogaan> I like the M-q to quickly format my paragraph.
[04:37:20] <technomancy> grym: on ... github
[04:37:29] <technomancy> https://github.com/go-jira/jira
[04:37:32] <technomancy> unofficial obviously
[04:37:39] <aidalgol> technomancy: BTW, you may have to disown me now that I have fallen in love with Godot.
[04:37:44] <edrx> xrogaan: which shorter key sequence do you want? we can define it.
[04:37:46] <xrogaan> I don't want evil mode, because I expect characters to be inserted into my document whenever I type something.
[04:37:47] <technomancy> and it fails hard if you use custom fields but hey
[04:37:58] <technomancy> aidalgol: as long as you don't say anything good about gdscript it's all good
[04:38:02] <Catie> aidalgol: the latter! I've been using Emacs for some years now, but only jumped on IRC like a month ago. And I've been having a rip roaring good time with it!
[04:38:08] <technomancy> gdscript is steaming garbage
[04:38:41] <aidalgol> GDScript isn't as bad as it first looked.  It has some nice conveniences.  I'm still not entirely convinced they couldn't have achieved the same thing with LuaJIT, though.
[04:38:59] <xrogaan> for searching, I would imagine M-/ or C-/ (but with my azerty keyboard, it would mean me using M-S-/)
[04:39:12] <technomancy> it's a scripting language. that doesn't have closures.
[04:39:24] <grym> xrogaan: ok, you can make that keybind if you like 
[04:39:25] <aidalgol> Oh god...  I hadn't run into that yet.
[04:39:41] <Catie> xrogaan: it's kind of hard to have it both ways in this case. Vim can have really short and single-key commands _because_ it's a modal editor and you have to enter insert mode to insert text. Emacs doesn't do modes, so you need either keychords or several keypresses
[04:39:56] <aidalgol> htf did C# of all things get so popular in the game industry?
[04:40:05] <grym> aidalgol: well, it doesn't suck
[04:40:06] <technomancy> even PHP has closures
[04:40:09] <grym> that helps
[04:40:15] <aidalgol> grym: ?
[04:40:18] <xrogaan> When I read the documentation about 'search-forward', it tells me that "It is bound to <find>.". What the heck is <find>?
[04:40:20] <grym> aidalgol: i quite like c# 
[04:40:34] <technomancy> aidalgol: my theory is that it has to do with the fact that .NET can run C++ on it, and that made game devs not get scared off by it maybe?
[04:40:35] <aidalgol> grym: Oh yeah, but I mean for scripting your game engine... seems overkill.
[04:40:54] <aidalgol> technomancy: I was going to guess just because it's from MS, and all the big players already love MS.
[04:41:30] <aidalgol> grym: Is C# overall less braindead than Java?
[04:41:32] <grym> aidalgol: isn't space engineers unofficial motto "anything worth doing is worth overdoing" 
[04:41:34] <technomancy> I'm sure that's a big part of it
[04:41:35] <grym> aidalgol: vastly 
[04:41:48] <edrx> xrogaan: btw, there are vi modes for Emacs, and there's this, for going beyond modes: https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/07/
[04:41:56] <technomancy> aidalgol: my understanding is that C# is a better language but the GC and JIT aren't nearly as good
[04:41:59] <aidalgol> Its toolchain on Linux hasn't been pleasant when I tried it a few years ago.
[04:42:00] <xrogaan> search-forward is probably useless. Apparently there is a C-s shortcut that does what I want.
[04:42:07] <aidalgol> technomancy: Java has a good GC?
[04:42:14] <edrx> xrogaan: I haven't tried it, but I found the video fascinating.
[04:42:18] <xrogaan> edrx: I know about evil, but I would use vim if I wanted vim ;)
[04:42:19] <technomancy> aidalgol: best in the world by a significant margin
[04:42:26] <aidalgol> technomancy: I thought that was LuaJIT.
[04:42:45] <technomancy> luajit's JIT is great but its GC is one of its weakest points
[04:42:50] <aidalgol> ah
[04:42:55] <xrogaan> it's just that some stuff from vim are convenient, like the quick goto line thing.
[04:42:56] <edrx> xrogaan: remember that we are still trying to understand what you want... =/

[04:44:11] <xrogaan> edrx: well, limiting the amount of key I have to press in order to access simple and basic features.
[04:44:15] <technomancy> that's what happens when you let people who sell server hardware design a VM =)
[04:44:38] <aidalgol> technomancy: Java really hasn't lived up to the promises it made in the '90s, has it?
[04:44:50] <technomancy> yeah the 90s were ridiculous
[04:44:50] <xrogaan> I still don't know what `<find>` in emacs' context though. Anybody has an idea?
[04:45:02] <xrogaan> is in emacs' context*
[04:45:14] <technomancy> aidalgol: .NET is a lot more appealing to game devs partly because it's written by a company whose bread and butter is desktop applications and not servers
[04:45:22] <Catie> xrogaan: well, it's the find key, of course!
[04:45:37] <technomancy> like no one cares if a JVM program takes a long time to start because that only happens like a few times a month, and even then it's behind a load balancer
[04:45:38] <grym> technomancy: the JIT got a real serious overhaul a few years ago and was, the last time i looked, pretty peppy 
[04:45:44] <xrogaan> Catie: is it from an obsolete keyboard layout?
[04:45:45] <Catie> Emacs is ancient, and many of the keys found on older keyboards no longer exist
[04:45:47] <grym> for c#.  but it's been a few years 
[04:45:52] <edrx> xrogaan: but the notion of "basic features" change from person to person!... for me, for example - note: I am a VERY BAD typist -, the only "basic feature" of Emacs is Elisp...
[04:46:09] <Catie> xrogaan: that would be my guess. Check out the Space Cadet keyboard if you get a chance
[04:46:09] <aidalgol> technomancy: Well... people I've talked to at work who are MS fanboys have said that they seem to be neglecting the desktop application frameworks in favour of the so-called ".Net stack" for web apps.

[04:48:48] <aidalgol> Catie: Which keyboard?
[04:48:59] <xrogaan> edrx: I believe that's in by default. I was looking at 'search-forward', which is what popups first when looking for a function named 'search'

[04:49:13] <technomancy> grym: but I think the JVM people stole more ideas from like ... self and their VM techniques

[05:24:14] <aidalgol> How does it *not* have them?
[05:24:35] <krux02> the F keys are just non-existent
[05:24:36] <aidalgol> They're the same size keycaps on my ergodox as on my standard keyboard.
[05:24:39] <grym> aidalgol: it does, iff you have a layer for them 
[05:24:46] <krux02> you acces the F key functionality with modifiers
[05:24:46] <grym> otherwise, it doesn't 
[05:24:53] <aidalgol> Right...  Layering is kinda half the point of the keyboard.
[05:25:02] <aidalgol> Anyway, now I know what you meant.
[05:25:05] <grym> yes, thus my warning about breath-holding
[05:25:39] <aidalgol> ...can I breathe yet?
[05:28:06] <krux02> grym, until ergodox made me a keyboard that is actually compatible with my layout and my requirement for F keys I will just stick to my old Das Keyboard
[05:28:12] <edrx> johnjay: what is "lateral motion increases difficulty"? is it something that only applies to touch-typists?
[05:28:27] <grym> krux02: ok, nobody's twisting your arm
[05:29:35] <krux02> what I am really frustrated about in emacs are these insane key sequences where each key requires a different modifier to be pressed in conjunction with it.
[05:29:42] <krux02> impossible to type
[05:30:09] <krux02> I am currently exploring doom emacs in the hopes that they fixed this madness
[05:30:11] <aidalgol> Maybe you'd prefer the vim approach?
[05:30:20] <edrx> hmm
[05:30:30] <krux02> but it comes with its own problems that I try to work around currently.
[05:30:36] *** Parts: laurus (~laurus@user/laurus) (Part)
[05:30:42] <edrx> maybe most of the first users of emacs were musicians
[05:30:53] <edrx> (not recorder players)
[05:31:20] <krux02> I like the concept of spacemacs doom emacs with the leader key and then just a normal sequnce of keys, no meta ctrl super madness
[05:31:54] <krux02> when you play the piano you have pedals for the modifiers.
[05:32:01] <xrogaan> edrx: moving your hand over your keyboard makes you loose your place as you loose the feeling of the keys. As the span of the keyboard is larger than both your hands, there are spots that are impossible to reach easily.
[05:32:05] <krux02> so you can press them independently of your fingers
[05:32:12] <krux02> very very handy
[05:32:27] <xrogaan> in my case, it's the key above the keys T and Y
[05:32:35] *** Joins: davemq (~davemq@99-179-0-50.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net)
[05:32:45] <krux02> but pedals for alt ctrl super shift etc were I think I actually thought about, but the solutions were too expensive in my opinion

Ditched vanilla after a week for doom because I really didn't want to figure out which stuff was needed in order to have a nice experience. Which made me understand that if it takes more than a day to get a text editor in a good state, then it's not worth sinking time into it.
[05:41:30] <krux02> not really worth the effort to relearn. It is mostly worth to relearn the stuff to enter the environments where all this other stuff is available

[06:16:09] <lockywolf> can some one mention: me again, for testing? 
[06:16:21] <Catie> lockywolf: test
[06:16:25] <aidalgol> Catie: I was referring to the general issue in the FOSS world.  e.g. gcc doesn't have any half-decent interface (or didn't for a while, if it does now) for other tools in the way that clang/llvm does, because that might make it easier for evil non-free software to benefit from free software.
[06:16:43] <lockywolf> Catie: excellent, thank you 
[06:17:08] <Catie> Ah I see, yeah that can be pretty prevalent. Especially in software from the FSS
[06:17:11] <aidalgol> Or if a project takes money from a large company, they've been compromised, etc.
[06:17:49] <wgreenhouse> aidalgol: well, like I said, literal communist :P
[06:17:59] <aidalgol> xrogaan: Not really, no.  I know a lot of people in the FOSS community strongly believe that we should be trying to prevent "bad people" from using free software "for harm", but I really *really* think that is the wrong place to be fighting that battle.
[06:18:26] *** Joins: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.103.113)
[06:18:47] <Catie> I'll definitely agree that making software harder to interoperate with is actively harmful, and shouldn't be used as a deterrent to usage by large entities
[06:18:55] <grym> aidalgol: it's incoherent, anyway 
[06:19:00] <aidalgol> grym: What is?
[06:19:12] <grym> aidalgol: "free" and "no bad people" 
[06:19:16] <grym> are mutually exclusive 
[06:19:25] <aidalgol> grym: A bit, yeah
[06:19:32] <grym> if you say "anyone can do anything with this" then you either mean it or you're bullshitting someone 
[06:19:36] <aidalgol> Catie: There's also the "fuck Freedom 0" camp, who are very hardlined on using so-called "no harm" licenses.
[06:19:58] <xrogaan> it's because "bad people" here are redefined to individual that are strongly acting against the interest of FOSS
[06:19:59] <aidalgol> grym: Usually when I see this camp pressed on this, they say "well then maybe it *shouldn't* be free software."
[06:20:29] <aidalgol> xrogaan: Oh, I was thinking more of the people who feel really uneasy about the idea that an npm package they publish might be used by US ICE at some point.
[06:20:46] <grym> aidalgol: "“You give up that idea; this is an imperfect world of joy and sorrow mingled. There may be a better land where bicycle saddles are made out of rainbow, stuffed with cloud; in this world the simplest thing is to get used to something hard." 
[06:20:49] <xrogaan> that is, if you publish your stuff under a full copyleft MIT. Somebody can come along, take you shit, and redistribute it in a closed and proprietary way.
[06:21:01] <Catie> My main issue with "no harm" licenses comes down to the fact that it's impossible to formally define. Legislation can't define morality, and a license can't capture it
[06:21:10] <grym> xrogaan: no it's like "someone who works for the government uses emacs, PANIK"
[06:21:38] <grym> and like... no shit, dude, that's how free stuff works 
[06:21:42] <aidalgol> Catie: Exactly my issue with it.
[06:21:50] <xrogaan> aidalgol: well, at the same time the NSA contributed a lot to cryptography.
[06:22:00] <xrogaan> They ain't angels either.
[06:22:10] <grym> sure 
[06:22:21] <grym> the morally pure, of course, have no need of encryption 
[06:22:24] <grym> having nothing to hide 
[06:22:28] <Catie> I _very_ much don't want anything I do to contribute to harm in the world. But I can't precisely define 'harm', which hamstrings me a bit
[06:22:30] <acdw> oh yeah
[06:22:31] <aidalgol> xrogaan: And there are people who still think that Tor is a big trojan horse or honeypot just because the US Navy worked on it *years* ago.
[06:22:32] * lockywolf happy, ERC finally does what I want it to do
[06:22:35] <grym> and no enemies who could possibly be interested in their plans 
[06:22:43] <xrogaan> Turning themselves into moral monster isn't the way forwarD.

[06:24:53] <lockywolf> As long as the FSF is doing such a poor job, such discussions are not very fruitious. 
[06:24:58] <aidalgol> xrogaan: Heck, even this very channel is not mentioned anywhere by the FSF because we refuse to enforce their policy of not mentioning non-free software and not offering assistance to people using Emacs with non-free software.

[07:45:12] <technomancy> johnjay: sometimes the runtime makes language choices for you
[07:47:00] <aidalgol> I think some of that is because the more you apply your beautiful language to serious work, reality soils it.

[09:34:38] <johnjay> FubbiQuantz: you need the hook because you want the thing to happen when evil mode activates. that just checks if evil mode is active when you check it
[09:35:05] <FubbiQuantz> johnjay That makes sense. Thank you for the clear explanation.

[09:37:00] <johnjay> er ok...
[09:37:03] * johnjay is very confused
[09:37:04] <dale> johnjay: And C-s for swiper-isearch should just be a replacement for regular isearch (which is on C-s by default).
[09:37:50] <johnjay> swiper-isearch does work directly yeah
[09:38:12] <johnjay> so is ivy only doing completions on buffers and commands?
[09:38:15] <johnjay> nothing else?
[09:38:31] <dale> I think Ivy or Counsel may have had something that kind of popped up completions, replacing completion-at-point, but I don't remember what that's called and I might be misremembering.
[09:38:33] <FubbiQuantz> I'm using Emacs prelude and autocomplete is driving me crazy in org mode. How can I turn off oautocomplete in org mode? I believe I have helm and ivy on, but I don't have helm-everywhere mode on.
[09:39:11] <dale> johnjay: I think if you turned on ivy-mode then you'll get Ivy completion anywhere completing-read is used?  Something like that.  Mainly files, buffers, command, etc.  counsel (and its counsel-mode) is a nice add-on to Ivy which provides additional functionality where Ivy would normally only offer completions.

[14:01:55] <empwilli> sorry for my ignorance :). why so? tbh. I simply use the functionality provided by spacemacs there, so it might be that it does some additional magic in the background :)

[18:09:32] <Shortstop> unfortunately, that's not the case with my current setup on the Mac, it doesn't match up like this
[18:09:42] <Shortstop> I did however nuke Dired's default behavior to open buffers everywhere
[18:09:50] <Shortstop> aka just to keep one buffer present at all times
[18:10:13] <Shortstop> but yeah the behavior is totally fine on Linux, its just not the same on MacOSX which is annoying a bit
[18:10:36] <Shortstop> I wonder if its an environment variable to force vterm to recognize the current path of Dired accordingly

[18:12:34] <gnoo> Shortstop: the a key on dired kills the current buffer and opens a new buffer with the selected item
[18:13:05] <Shortstop> wow, that's actually kind of useful

[18:13:13] <Shortstop> I've been using enter

[18:13:45] <Shortstop> that helps with normal usage to edit files in Emacs which is fine

[19:33:15] <Shortstop> nicode same, default menu bar is good for newbies, but the whole point of Emacs is do everything with keybindings

[19:33:27] <Shortstop> nice acdw good to see you

[19:43:36] <umaxtu> why would you use terminal emacs?
[19:44:15] <gnoo> johnjay: you're right. i was just confused because of the shape ;_;

[19:49:20] <Shortstop> yeah these British computers are pretty cool
[19:49:37] <Shortstop> this is coming from an Amiga fan myself that wishes they could find one, but settles for just an emulator on Fedora Linux
[19:49:40] <johnjay> > Acorn was a Cambridge-based firm that started in 1979 after developing computer systems originally designed to run fruit machines

[22:59:39] <physikoi> Hello. I'm using tramp to access a remote project. i don't have permission to ssh as root; however, i can `sudo su` to elevate my privileges from terminal. Is there a way to accomplish this with tramp so that i can edit the files through emacs?
[23:00:18] <thblt> Shortstop: it really should Just Work.
[23:00:40] <physikoi> oh nmv. got it
[23:00:44] <thblt> physikoi: have you googled it, like “emacs tramp sudo”?

[23:05:35] <nicode> Silly question... I'm running a terminal in emacs and I want start a new window below it (i.e. split down) but the regular key binding (C-x 2) does nothing because the input is going to the terminal I presume. Is there a way to get around this?

[23:07:38] <nicode> I opened it w/ the sequence "M-x term" and I confirmed I wanted /bin/bash
[23:08:17] <technomancy> ah, ok. I haven't used M-x term but I think it has a toggle between line-mode and char-mode?
[23:08:32] *** Quits: jmd (~user@de.cellform.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:08:41] <technomancy> char-mode will pass thru your commands like C-x 2 so you'd need to switch to line-mode
[23:09:03] <nicode> Actually, I just found that when I'm in term mode, the shortcut for new window is changed...

[23:50:59] <Shortstop> technomancy honestly, I tried ERC for a month, and it sucks compared to Weechat
[23:51:10] <Shortstop> at least with Weechat, you have tabs, saved channels, a decent config
[23:51:33] <Shortstop> nicode there's a 'weechat.el' MELPA package too, but I haven't used it yet, might be worth it though if you find someone else's config
[23:52:02] <Shortstop> nicode tmux rules though by the way, love it. I have been having the WORST time to get 256 color support working for tmux on MacOSX though in the last 2 weeks, not sure why
[23:52:09] <Shortstop> stupid thing just works in Linux without a problem

[23:57:06] <thblt> Guest56: the argument is very weak, IMHO.  I could see arguments for writing an Emacs-ish edtor that'd use Haskell as its extension language, but this article gives exactly zero arguments for an Haskell reimplementation of the very same Lisp. What advantages would that be supposed to bring?
