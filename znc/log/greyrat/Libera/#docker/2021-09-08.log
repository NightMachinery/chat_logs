[00:25:44] <ada_> its pretty great
[00:28:49] <programmerq> GyrosGeier▸ you might need to specify the correct --add-cap to get that to work. Look at the list of capabilities that docker drops by default and try adding them in using a binary search pattern to figure out which one is right. You might also be able to search the kernel capabilities docs and figure it out that way. I'm usually happy doing a quick trial and error approach since the binary
[00:28:51] <programmerq> search method makes quick work of it if I'm not sure.
[00:30:05] <programmerq> most of the time, usually cap_sys_admin or cap_net_admin are the ones I end up using. The former is needed for mount(). the latter is for managing networking devices and netfilter inside the container. I'd guess that unshare(2) is tied to cap_sys_admin, but if it isn't that's where the guess and check method is handy.

I'm trying to use a tool that crawls docker images and outputs a list of packages used in it, however it is having issues with some of the layers. I wanted to try with a flat image if that is
[03:11:41] <canurabus> possible.

[03:16:15] <zoredache> canurabus: when I search for 'docker collapse layers' I am getting several potentially useful methods. An export + import with certain options, a multi-stage build that copies one image on top of scratch. Try searching and testing some of the methods?

[14:50:12] <bailsman> How does docker dns forwarding work? I can see /etc/resolv.conf is configured to use 127.0.0.11. And I can also see that iptables rules are forwarding queries to 127.0.0.1:53 to 127.0.0.1:43300. But where do they go from there? What is listening on that address? Nothing inside the container

[18:09:04] <programmerq> you'd need to set up some sort of X forwarding to get an x11 gui application running. this old blog post has the basic approach: https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/
[18:09:17] <programmerq> your distro may have the socket at a slightly different location. make sure something simple like xterm displays.
[18:10:13] <programmerq> honestly, a snap or flatpak might be an easier approach if you want a graphical application on your linux desktop. they use similar isolation tech to docker, but give more of a "regular" ux to the end user.
[18:10:51] <golden_ticket> thanks
[18:11:01] <programmerq> another thing you can do is set up a container running x11vnc and set up your gui application to display to that. You'd be able to use it via a VNC client.
[18:11:24] <programmerq> I've done that once or twice when I want a totally blank throwaway firefox browser

[18:18:19] <programmerq> with the default/legacy docker0 network, I would expect docker to ignore that entry and then use 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 instead. If you switch your /etc/resolv.conf to have the actual real DNS server that isn't the systemd-resolved address, then it should use that.

[18:20:16] <programmerq> if you connect a container to a 'docker network create' type network, then the container will always have the 127.0.0.11 in its resolver, and then docker acts as a caching dns server running on your host. as far as I know, it is able to use the systemd-resolved 127.0.0.53 since that's running where dockerd is running, but I'd need to test it out to be sure. docker run --net mycustomnetwork ...

[18:21:28] <Koopz> yeah i tried the "dns: 192.168.1.10 in docker-compose.yml" approach already, which didn't do anything
[18:23:13] <programmerq> golden_ticket▸ make sure a simpler gui application like xterm is able to display as an intermediary troubleshooting step.
[18:23:45] <programmerq> Koopz docker-compose uses a 'docker network create' type network, so it will always show the 127.0.0.11 address inside the container's /etc/resolv.conf
[18:23:58] <golden_ticket> programmerq: it is
[18:24:33] <programmerq> try comparing the output of 'dig username.projectname.local @127.0.0.11' and 'dig username.projectname.local @192.168.1.10' from inside the container. you may need to install dig.
[18:26:17] <programmerq> golden_ticket▸ hmmm. that suggests that it's more likely a problem with your specific application and not necessarily docker or your x forwarding setup. you might be able to run your application via strace to get a better idea as to what it's actually doing, but it could also be waiting on something not specifically x11 related too. if it isn't outputting anything, then you just don't have a lot

[21:03:32] <cluelessperson> what is the purpose of the external flag for docker volumes in docker-compose?
[21:03:36] *** Joins: farmstatejake (~farmstate@user/farmstatejake)
[21:05:06] <akik> cluelessperson: you can create the volumes manually and not according to some naming standard the daemon decides
[21:05:45] *** Joins: sudomann (~sudomann@73.183.118.9)
[21:06:29] <cluelessperson> akik, I guess my question is,  will any named volume remove even after you down services?
[21:06:47] <akik> cluelessperson: no they're not removed 
[21:06:48] <cluelessperson> it doesn't require external to remain through cycling services?
[21:06:50] <cluelessperson> sweet
[21:06:54] <cluelessperson> that seems to be the case.
[21:07:02] <akik> cluelessperson: well ok i can only talk about my own experience with swarm
[21:07:13] <akik> cluelessperson: but i'm about 100% sure they won't be removed
[21:07:58] <akik> i can run docker stack rm and all data is kept
[21:08:29] <akik> except the data in the container writable layer

[21:10:28] <cluelessperson> it seems named volumes are not automatically downed or cleaned up
[21:10:36] <cluelessperson> protecting volumes by default.
[21:10:37] <cluelessperson> good :D
[21:15:22] <cluelessperson> Error response from daemon: remove service1_configs: volume has active mounts
[21:15:28] <cluelessperson> I can't remove this docker volume
[21:16:04] <cluelessperson> There are NO mounts do that volume's directory
[21:21:23] <ada_> you must have a container that exists with that volume attached
[21:21:30] <ada_> it may be an exited container

[22:10:24] <ada_> prune doesn't necessarily remove everything
