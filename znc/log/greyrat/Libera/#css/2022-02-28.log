[08:11:15] <hmw[at]> rickame: There's only so much we can change about a checkbox. But one can use appearence:none; to completely hide the built-in checkboxes and then make your own. See https://harald.ist.org/paste/custom_checkbox.html
[08:13:32] <rickame> we can't set background color of checkbox?
[08:14:06] <scream> rickame: Checkboxes are elements typically drawn by the OS in the old days, and drawn by the browser at a rawer level in newer browsers. Safari sucks at it.
[08:14:40] <rickame> man that sucks
[08:15:21] <scream> Agreed.
[08:15:36] <scream> Simultaneously, think of a web in which stupider people than you are allowed to fuck with how every checkbox looks.
[08:16:16] <rickame> ya that's true too but i think that ship has sailed. it's impossible for ppl to know the difference between a legit security alert and 1 drawn in css to look exactly the same
[08:16:30] <rickame> at least let us do some basic stuff like tinting the standard controls
[08:16:38] <rickame> like accent color just a bit deeper
[08:16:51] <scream> https://codepen.io/aaroniker/pen/ZEYoxEY rickame: i can change "background" just fine in this.
[08:17:37] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[08:18:34] <scream> figured out why
[08:18:47] <scream> you have to set -webkit-appearance and -moz-appearance to none
[08:18:53] <scream> lmfao jesus fucking chirst
[08:18:59] <scream> it's a nice way to do it though
[08:19:06] <scream> "draw the things like the browser wants until I tell it to fuck off"
[08:19:16] <scream> rickame: hope that helps
[08:19:21] <rickame> ya but should be standard not vendor prefix
[08:19:26] <scream> oh ffs do i have to restyle it after that though
[08:19:50] <scream> rickame: i don't think "appearance: none" would make a good looking attr
[08:20:12] <scream> i think you have to roll your own functionality if you set the appearance to none, though
[08:20:38] <rickame> hm if i use appearance none, accent-color stops working for checked state but it was nice
[08:20:54] <scream> correct; it doesn't imply anything after
[08:21:05] <scream> perhaps because you have to reapply all of the masked stuff
[08:21:19] <hmw[at]> -moz-appearance should no longer be required
[08:21:28] <rickame> i guess ig otta style it based on checked state. so when checked i dont make appearance none, but when not checked i do
[08:21:36] <rickame> huh?
[08:21:40] <scream> hmw[at]: really?
[08:21:49] <hmw[at]> I made that example over a year ago
[08:21:55] <hmw[at]> and it works in my FF
[08:21:55] <scream> wtf you made it
[08:21:58] <scream> nice
[08:22:10] <scream> small world
[08:22:44] <hmw[at]> I mean https://harald.ist.org/paste/custom_checkbox.html
[08:22:56] <scream> oh shit, okay, i missed your original message
[08:23:10] <scream> sorry about that; i see where you mentioned appearance:none
[08:24:07] <hmw[at]> I am not even so frustrated about not being able to color certain things, but much more about how difficult it is to position them properly. line-height is a headache-inducer with native checkboxes.
[08:25:30] <scream> yeah, that kind of shit keeps me tossing and turning, and while i see some good examples by (ab?)using grid, it feels fucky to just put grids everywhere
[08:25:45] <scream> despite how easy it is to fix shit as a result
[08:26:17] <hmw[at]> Well, we have a workaround at least
[08:26:50] <scream> Agreed, though since I was young, the only promising thing is that the workarounds get simpler.
[08:27:47] <hmw[at]> *IE6 PTSD intensifies*
[08:28:40] <rickame> k got it working https://jsfiddle.net/35g26opw/1/
[08:28:47] <rickame> any way to make it better?
[08:31:03] <scream> hmw[at]: that was my favorite workaround of all. "make less money but live happy."
[08:31:21] <scream> rickame: I don't like the raw yellow. What's it look like on the actual page?
[08:31:41] <rickame> ignore the colors that's just for showing the fn
[08:31:53] <hmw[at]> Yeah. Yellow may be interpreted as some sort of selection, like "required: I accept the terms of slavery"
[08:31:57] <rickame> we got an easy way to change checkbox colors
[08:32:28] <scream> yeah, agreed, hmw
[08:32:30] <scream> ah good
[08:32:40] <rickame> im black btw
[08:32:57] <scream> rickame { color: white; }
[08:33:12] <scream> whoops, forgot the special ingredient
[08:33:13] <rickame> i wish
[08:33:21] <scream> rickame { appearance:none; } ;P
[08:33:58] <scream> by the way, only tested it on my one browser, but it does appear that "appearance: none" works fine, and you don't need the "uglier" vendor-based ones
[08:34:11] <scream> appearance is such a bad name for that, i feel like, but here i am
[08:39:13] <rickame> oh ya vendor prefixes not needed nice

[16:35:06] <DPA> Oh, I see. In some cases, float:right; or writing-mode:vertical-rl; can also have such an effect. Although those also do some other stuff.

[17:17:35] <hmw[at]> fweht: flexbox and grid are new features, that we *abused* to do certain layout things. Since we now have proper ways for these kinds of things, float isn't needed (and semantically fitting really) often anymore. Today you'd see it most likely in pages that are formatted like text books for example (Wikipedia). I still would recommend to everyone to familiarize themselves with it, because it can come in handy at times.
[17:17:55] <hmw[at]> oops.
[17:18:12] <hmw[at]> * we abused float for things, we have flex and grid now
[17:18:18] <fweht> yeah, i think those textbook layouts are actually nice, maybe ill need it some day
[17:18:53] <hmw[at]> Sometimes (rarely), float also can help with modern page layouts, but not often
[17:19:09] <hmw[at]> It can be a live saver in some instances though :) I love my float
[17:19:20] <fweht> in my case i found a different (yet still funky) solution
