[02:26:39] <Nanobot> So, it sounds like they're saying that the next HoloEN generation will consist of Hope, Space, Time, Nature, Knowledge... and is Civilization a sixth one? I don't know if the 5 members includes IRyS or not.
[02:30:08] <Nanobot> Honestly, I wish they wouldn't try to do all the theming and lore stuff; they should just base the characters on the performers' personality and preferences. IRyS = Hope kinda makes no sense and isn't even interesting at all.
[02:31:21] <Nanobot> Besides, in the end, they all just turn into catgirls anyway.

[04:24:30] <duds_> thank you
[04:24:45] <ButterNoodle> I watch a lot of garbage
[04:24:55] <ButterNoodle> there is a lot of 2nd seasons
[04:25:24] <duds_> that's good, we've been getting single season throwaways for far too long...
[04:26:35] <ButterNoodle> ofc dicks out for dragon maids.. kyouani is best
[04:27:22] <ButterNoodle> tokyo revengers is excellent coming from someone that doesnt care for shounen
[04:27:40] <ButterNoodle> slime is eeeeh
[04:27:52] <ButterNoodle> and higurashi is tits
[04:28:00] <duds_> slime is an isekai ü§Æ
[04:28:05] <duds_> not interested
[04:28:28] <ButterNoodle> fumetsu no anata e has its good points and a good world being built.. idk if they are gonna pull of what could be an amazing anime
[04:28:43] <duds_> man...
[04:28:47] <ButterNoodle> I said the same about wonder egg.. and then it shit the bed
[04:28:49] <duds_> sounds good ........
[04:29:51] <ButterNoodle> so far tho.. fuemtesu no anata e has had some real great character building moments, and some tearful moments too.. so its pretty good imho
[04:30:02] <ButterNoodle> may be a run for anime of the year in my books
[04:30:31] <ButterNoodle> trash winner for this season is jahy-sama...
[04:30:43] <duds_> weren't people excited for that one lol
[04:30:50] <duds_> the manga is quite popular afaik
[04:31:08] <ButterNoodle> reverse isekai on the lines of hataraku maou-sama.. 
[04:31:20] <ButterNoodle> except with a touch of ecchi
[04:31:47] <ButterNoodle> to which I hear we are getting another season of maou-sama in the next year
[04:31:54] <duds_> reverse isekai can be fun I think 
[04:32:06] <ButterNoodle> yes is a different dynamic
[04:32:11] <duds_> I like uncle from another world a bit... mostly for the sega references lol
[04:32:46] <ButterNoodle> everyone trying to out dick the other isekai u know... I like satire in my isekai.. konosuba being a good example of making fun of the genera 
[04:33:11] <duds_> ye konosuba is the only isekai I've enjoyed lol
[04:33:15] <ButterNoodle> kinda like how OPM makes fun of shounen and still pulls off being an awesome shounen
[04:34:05] <duds_> that I did not watch üßê
[04:34:09] <duds_> because shounen.......
[04:34:47] <ButterNoodle> tantei wa mou shindeiru is promising and has cute girls, but I think they are gonna fall on their face trying to be a detective mystery romance with extra steps.. its a decent one
[04:35:17] <ButterNoodle> yea one punch man is almost a must watch like bebop
[04:36:02] <ButterNoodle> although a 2nd season that could objectionably be called shit. the first season made it hard to follow up

[15:02:00] <amigojapan> saganman: I guess one thing I really like about sailor moon is that good and evil aren't clear. Bad people become good and good people betray and become bad

[17:32:28] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Gelatin desserts are desserts made with a sweetened and flavored processed collagen product. This kind of dessert was first recorded as jelly by Hannah Glasse in her 18th century book The Art of Cookery, appearing in a layer of trifle.
[17:33:39] <amigojapan> Wait, that's jellow
[17:33:48] <amigojapan> !c jellow
[17:33:49] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Jell-O is a variety of gelatin desserts, puddings, and no-bake cream pies. The original Jell-O gelatin dessert is the signature of the brand. Jell-O is a registered trademark of Kraft Heinz and is based in Chicago, Illinois.

[17:50:16] <Sadale> moonjelly, screw you. You know that I don't like monoeye pics right? xD

[17:50:59] <Sadale> dfch, I've just used the government's voucher to purchase an SSD for my imouto. It's an upgrade from HDD :3
[17:51:41] <amigojapan> moonjelly: I will ask in an import store. It seems in Japan even if you search for baking chocolate it still has sugar in it
[17:51:43] <dfch> Sadale, have you got your r-pi replacement? 
[17:51:49] <Sadale> dfch, not yet. Too busy for that.
[17:51:51] <ButterNoodle> yea that shit is strange
[17:52:02] <Sadale> dfch, I'll probably get it tho. But not right now.
[17:52:18] <dfch> sure thing, take your time, just curious
[17:52:44] <moonjelly> amigojapan, that's odd, since they like having control of the sugar content in most baking recipes
[17:52:48] <Sadale> dfch, I've a hunch that you'd be happy if I ended up getting the r-pi replacement because it's you who suggested me to get it. :p
[17:53:26] <Sadale> Don't get me wrong. I'd be happy as well because it'd have better performance over the RPI. And I could install my unused 8TB drive to it. :3
[17:53:34] <amigojapan> moonjelly: few people bake in Japan. Ovens are not often found in homes here
[17:53:56] <dfch> Sadale, honestly just curious how it'll perform in comparison (in theory should be MUCH better, but again not sure what kind of stuff you running on it)
[17:54:16] <moonjelly> amigojapan, then maybe that kind of chocolate is more for the professionals
[17:54:25] <Sadale> dfch, RPI is slow af for web scraping. That's the main problem I've got right now. :(
[17:54:27] <snake> i have an interview in 36 minutes
[17:54:33] <dfch> 8TB is not enough for proper 4k one piece collection xD
[17:54:40] <amigojapan> Right moonjelly

[20:06:34] <DunceCotus> it was 7:30 then like 2 hours later it was 12pm
[20:07:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: were you having fun?
[20:07:17] <DunceCotus> not especially
[20:07:20] <Nanobot> Evil alien monsters have appeared in Japan. They eat cute girls and then use an illusion to make themselves look just like the girls they ate. There's only one way to detect them: a pair of x-ray goggles developed by MC's uncle. These goggles have become infamous for their ability to see through clothing, but it turns out they DON'T see through the clothing of the disguised aliens. It is now up to MC to find and defeat the aliens, while trying to avoid 
[20:07:20] <Nanobot> being labeled as a perverted enemy of all women.
[20:07:24] <DunceCotus> funner than I'd have at work though
[20:07:44] <DunceCotus> Nanobot hawt

[23:13:20] <emmeka> we've been playing Animal Crossing again... the original...
[23:13:53] <mexen> Fiance and I are playing New Horizons
[23:13:55] <emmeka> because fuck upgrading consoles, I've just been expanding my gamecube library for 20 years
[23:14:18] <mathu> emmeka: i really like the switch one but i miss how mean the villagers were in the GC one
[23:14:21] <DunceCotus> emmeka good choise
[23:14:40] <emmeka> mathu yeah, they're real dicks. I never played the Switch one but I played the DS one way back
[23:14:49] <DunceCotus> I doubt the new ones have really improved villager AI
[23:15:16] <emmeka> we in the west actually got the short end of the stick with Animal Crossing
[23:15:20] <DunceCotus> doddering around, inane conversations that constantly repeat themselves, getting in your way etc.
[23:16:01] <DunceCotus> emmeka yeah Animal Crossing eReader one in Japan was quite special
[23:16:20] <emmeka> Animal Crossing e+ didn't just add the eReader though
[23:16:31] <DunceCotus> no it had other features that made it special
[23:16:58] <emmeka> it added all sorts of new content, and screenshots which you could transfer onto an SD card (only official use of the SD card reader attachment)
[23:19:00] <emmeka> DunceCotus the only real difference new versions have made, as far as I can tell, is 1) different little minigames 2) real multiplayer functionality 3) more different kinds of fish/bugs/items 4) you can change your hat separately from the rest of your outfit
[23:20:19] <DunceCotus> emmeka you can also place decals on the ground
[23:20:29] <DunceCotus> and do more with gardening
[23:20:35] <DunceCotus> but yeah, they haven't changed much
[23:20:54] <emmeka> original Gamecube one allows you to visit your friend's towns, by putting their memory card in slot B, but it doesn't let you actually play together at the same time unlike every version to come after

[23:27:34] <emmeka> you hear that Animal Crossing is no good rando25892 ?
[23:27:41] <mexen> I only ever played New Leaf before New Horizons so I don't have a rich history. But I have enjoyed my time with it.
[23:27:51] <sentionics> I just took some oxy
[23:27:56] <sentionics> I'm drunk as shit
[23:28:10] <sentionics> lol, if it takes me, it takes me
[23:28:21] <emmeka> rando25892 it's a very relaxing game.
[23:28:48] <mexen> precisely
[23:29:02] <mexen> I play maybe 30-40 minutes a day
[23:29:15] <mexen> Funny enough, so was Death Stranding
[23:29:27] <mexen> It was a therapeutic game for me
[23:29:42] <mexen> I would walk around to BB's Theme
[23:29:53] <emmeka> rando25892 in Animal Crossing time proceeds in real time, with a real world calendar and real world seasons. This means that you typically play it only a little bit per day because eventually you run out of things to do.
[23:30:28] <DunceCotus> emmeka I kinda spoiled the game for myself cause it took 2 years to get to my country (the gamecube version)
[23:30:42] <DunceCotus> and it meant I already knew all the surprises it offered :(
[23:30:49] <emmeka> that's fine though
[23:30:57] <emmeka> it's not really meant to be a game that surprises you
[23:31:17] <DunceCotus> yeah but its kinda annoying the realtime element
[23:31:28] <DunceCotus> cause I end up having things on when there are big events in the game
[23:31:31] <DunceCotus> 'big'
[23:31:33] <emmeka> I didn't get Animal Crossing when it was new, though my friend did. It wasn't until into Wii times that I picked up a copy.
[23:32:02] <rando25892> oh ok
[23:32:08] <DunceCotus> I remember reading about it in a magazine about Animal Forest on N64
[23:32:13] <DunceCotus> then it was ported to GC
[23:32:25] <rando25892> i just heard it my cousin bought it ask us before buying then bought it and react to not liking it maybe he plays it ill have to ask

[23:32:58] <mexen> I will say this though, New Horizons handles local MP terribly
[23:32:58] <emmeka> DunceCotus RIP 64DD, the least successful Nintendo console of all time
[23:33:17] <emmeka> does it? that's unfortunate.
[23:33:28] <emmeka> I remember local multiplayer on the DS version being lots of fun
[23:33:42] <DunceCotus> it was fun
[23:33:57] <DunceCotus> but I was annoyed at how little they changed compared to GC version
[23:34:06] <DunceCotus> but still cool to have portable version
[23:34:32] <DunceCotus> its not really a game that needs multiplayer
[23:34:43] <DunceCotus> cause what are you going to do with others? catch bugs? Meh
[23:34:54] <emmeka> the biggest change was that the world is actually continuously scrolling
[23:34:56] <DunceCotus> visiting towns is cool and all but otherwise
[23:35:09] <DunceCotus> emmeka yeah
[23:35:43] <DunceCotus> the GC version has this.. something I don't know what
[23:35:46] <DunceCotus> cozy feeling
[23:36:00] <DunceCotus> when it rains in-game and in real life.. brulliant
[23:36:00] <emmeka> yeah, the multiplayer doesn't really *do* anything that you couldn't do with the GC version's world-visiting thing
[23:36:29] <emmeka> the only real use to it is trading with your friends, or getting their kind of fruit tree
[23:36:30] <sentionics> i fear that if I fall asleep right now, I'll die
[23:36:46] <sentionics> staying awake as best as I can
[23:36:56] <sentionics> I fucked up bad
[23:36:59] <DunceCotus> emmeka the GC version also had the GBA island thing
[23:37:02] <DunceCotus> that was super awesome
[23:37:04] <emmeka> yeah
[23:37:08] <DunceCotus> you could get exotic fruits
[23:37:12] <DunceCotus> without having to visit other towns
[23:37:15] <sentionics> I'm drunk, but I went and took some oxy b/c I'm in pain
[23:37:27] <sentionics> I read up on it, now I see
[23:37:34] <DunceCotus> sentionics uh oh
[23:37:38] <sentionics> this is a bad combo
[23:37:51] <sentionics> alcohol and oxy shouldn't be mixed.
[23:37:55] <sentionics> fuck man
[23:37:56] <DunceCotus> sentionics keep ambulance on speed dial
[23:37:57] <DunceCotus> just in case
[23:38:08] <sentionics> well, I should be fine
[23:38:09] <DunceCotus> sentionics you'll get through this
[23:38:13] <sentionics> just have to stay awake
[23:38:15] <DunceCotus> even if we have to do some re-arranging
[23:38:36] <sentionics> lol, my home is quite empty
[23:38:41] <sentionics> nothing to rearrange
[23:38:49] <DunceCotus> I don't mean your 'home' per se
[23:38:51] <DunceCotus> ;)
[23:39:15] <sentionics> you're a good guy/girl DunceCotus: I really like you

[23:40:11] <sentionics> Jigsy I demand that you sleep!
[23:40:13] <DunceCotus> sentionics I had to call 000 (emergency number in my country) on a shroom trip once
[23:40:26] <DunceCotus> I know how dangerous drugs can be
[23:40:58] <sentionics> DunceCotus: I see. well, at 14:52: we'll see how fucked I am
[23:40:59] <pteague> disaster recovery drills are always fun ... at least it's a drill & not the real thing
[23:41:09] <sentionics> I hope I don't go down hard
[23:41:27] <mathu> sentionics: how much longer are you on the oxy? you should try to cut drinking again
[23:41:31] <sentionics> oxy takes an hour to go into effect
[23:41:51] <sentionics> 1:52 is when I took the dose
[23:41:54] <mathu> i mean you should try to cut drinking again regardless but especially until you're done with the oxy
[23:42:07] <mathu> what i mean is how much longer do you have a prescription for it
[23:42:10] <sentionics> well, yeah
[23:42:21] <sentionics> ah, no refills
[23:42:28] <sentionics> I have 5 doses left
[23:42:43] <pteague> first thing i tend to do is check if it's ok with alcohol...
[23:42:59] <sentionics> it's not...
[23:43:22] <pteague> yep... neither was the opiod they put me on last year when i had the kidney stone
[23:43:43] <sentionics> I think I'm already feeling it
[23:43:53] <sentionics> that feeling when you start to get the body high
[23:44:10] <sentionics> eh, I'll probably be ok
[23:44:19] <sentionics> I don't think this will slay me
[23:45:31] <sentionics> huh, I didn't imagine it'd be this tame
[23:45:41] <sentionics> well, guess I'm not dying
