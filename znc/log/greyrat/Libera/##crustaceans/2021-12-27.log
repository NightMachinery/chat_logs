[01:00:25] <buttsbot> Employers with Illinois Employees: Revise Form Noncompete and Nonsolicitation Provisions Before January 1, 2022 - Epstein Becker & Green, P....
[01:00:48] <manicennui> So non-competes are pretty much dead for us in IL.
[01:01:53] <manicennui> Strange that they set such a low minimum when most of the other provisions will make them null and void until you are at the executive level.
[01:02:06] <manicennui> Under the Act, covenants not to compete and covenants not to solicit are ‚Äúillegal and void‚Äù unless (1) the employee ‚Äúreceives adequate consideration,‚Äù
[01:02:12] <manicennui> That should basically be the main point of the act.
[01:03:48] <manicennui> Hmm. The adequate consideration section is a little more unclear.
[01:05:00] <manicennui> Non-compete agreements for employees are fucking stupid and should be outlawed unconditionally.
[01:05:30] <manicennui> Companies already have ways to protect their IP.
[01:05:45] <manicennui> There are no other legitimate reasons for non-competes.
[01:10:38] <Church> Eyep
[01:10:47] <Church> So I got a story
[01:10:59] <Church> Technically my "second job" in tech.
[01:12:13] <Church> Guy I met at a conference reached out to me, wanted to work/start a startup. Gave me some paperwork to sign before I could be read in... lessee, NDA, 5y non-compete which was so broad it was unenforceable in NYS. So I sign it and get read in, wanted me to work for free for like a year or two before got funding.
[01:12:18] <Church> I laughed and left.
[01:12:29] <Church> I still have access to that dude's company slack too I think
[01:13:28] <manicennui> I thought this new act in IL was pretty good, but silly in parts, but it turns out that "adequate consideration" is not at all what any ethical human being would expect.
[01:13:42] <manicennui> And the act basically just codifies a bunch of precedence.
[01:14:09] <manicennui> The Act specifically defines ‚Äúadequate consideration‚Äù to mean (1) the employee worked for the employer for at least two years after signing the agreement containing the covenant, or
[01:14:21] <manicennui> How is having been employed for 2 years consideration?
[01:14:32] <manicennui> That was consideration for the 2 years, not time after you leave.
[01:18:48] <manicennui> I don't understand the thinking behind non-competes other than pure corporate power and corruption.
[01:23:20] <manicennui> They should be more along the lines of, "we will continue to pay your salary for up to X years if you don't work for a competitor", with no ability to stop anyone from working for a competitor.

[20:41:49] <manicennui> When did what happen?
[20:41:55] <dminkovsky> routers requiring

[20:42:28] <indigo> I also did it to keep interview skills sharp‚Ä¶ unfortunately most software companies still interview by programming whiteboarda
[20:42:42] <manicennui> "I'm shopping a router and from what I read in the reviews, ALL mid-end family routers (those between $40 and $100) that I see need a cloud account to access the management page"
[20:42:52] <manicennui> They want an actual network router.
[20:42:58] <manicennui> Sad that management pages require cloud shit.
[20:43:02] <manicennui> I hate that crap.
[20:43:13] <dminkovsky> cue REM
[20:43:47] <manicennui> Top comment recommends OpenWRT.
[20:44:22] <indigo> I‚Äôm surprised that no one recommends a separate router + AP
[20:44:36] <manicennui> Is there any real need for an actual router at home?
[20:44:50] <manicennui> You are going to have like one route.
[20:45:03] <manicennui> I assume they actually mean like a cable model/AP.
[20:45:08] <manicennui> modem
[20:45:20] <manicennui> But yeah, I do separate cable modem and AP.
[20:45:38] <indigo> Good question! If you have a gigabit link, most consumer routers won‚Äôt be able to push a gigabit through Ethernet
[20:46:07] <imode> time to archive all of my spare SD cards.
[20:46:27] <manicennui> I just meant that I don't think they want a dedicated router. They want a bridge with the ability to add a default gateway, probably through DHCP.
[20:46:49] <manicennui> If we are calling everything that can do routing a routing, then every computer and smartphone is a router.
[20:47:27] <indigo> Now we‚Äôre getting into semantics. I thought they meant something like a router+AP combo like Google Wifi
[20:47:34] <manicennui> Probably.
[20:47:43] <manicennui> I was hoping they wanted to discuss real routers.
[20:47:53] <manicennui> Haven't seen a discussion about real routers in a long time.
[20:48:01] <manicennui> I assume network gnomes still talk about them.
[20:48:46] <indigo> I expect real routers to be way above their price range ($40-$100)
[20:48:55] <manicennui> I don't know.
[20:49:13] <manicennui> I suppose no one need the kind of low end Cisco router that handles a T1 anymore.
[20:49:22] <manicennui> Because I wouldn't expect those to go for much anymore.
[20:49:36] <manicennui> But Cisco is kind of shitty with their pricing.
[20:49:50] <manicennui> Been out of that game for a long time.
[20:50:26] <indigo> IIRC you also need to buy a license in addition to the hardware for Cisco
[20:50:27] <manicennui> I was trying to find something low end to do multi-homing with multiple T1s back in the day, and Cisco's low end routers didn't have enough RAM to do BGP or something.
[20:50:40] <manicennui> Even though they were plenty powerful.
[20:51:20] <manicennui> They just wanted you to buy a far more expensive router.
[20:52:08] <ngoldbaum> these days in the consumer market a router is a wireless AP
[20:52:35] <manicennui> I guess I hoped that people on HN were discussing something more interesting.
[20:52:42] <manicennui> I should have known better.
[20:53:16] <ngoldbaum> i do have an honest-to-god gigabit switch in the basement though
[20:54:41] <indigo> Is it for uploading yourself to the metaverse
[20:56:10] <manicennui> Good god. rubocop complained about alignment, and when I let it autocorrect it made the code terrible.
[20:56:15] <manicennui> But this is what it wants. Fuck it.

[23:30:22] <dminkovsky> how consequential could vinyl production be in the big picture
[23:31:25] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Probably not very, but it is growing in popularity.
[23:32:05] <manicennui> I do think this group is going a bit overboard, but it does seem like there are a couple of areas where things could be better.
[23:32:25] <manicennui> They admit in that article that few records end up in landfills though.
[23:35:53] <manicennui> Seems like removing lead from the manufacturing process that some companies use, getting rid of the cling wrap, and maybe finding an alternative to PVC would solve most of the problems.
[23:36:54] * manicennui is pretty sure that no one at work is working today.
[23:37:58] <Brekkjern> lol
[23:38:01] <Brekkjern> Of course they aren't :p
[23:38:29] <manicennui> A lot of people are out, but the PMs aren't active on Slack.
[23:38:41] <manicennui> And there are basically no meetings today.
[23:42:56] <Brekkjern> Even my boss and I was goofing off during christmas a couple years back
[23:43:10] <Brekkjern> Just chatting and talking about christmas
[23:44:45] <manicennui> Yeah, that is pretty typical when in the office.
[23:44:53] <manicennui> Now that we aren't in the office, no one even has to pretend.
[23:45:06] <Brekkjern> Yeah :P
[23:49:37] <manicennui> I only need to make it through Wednesday.
[23:49:46] <manicennui> I took Thursday off and Friday is a holiday.
[23:50:33] * manicennui tries Target's same day delivery service.
[23:50:41] <dminkovsky> i can't figure out whether to cancel my friends from new york comping
[23:51:02] <dminkovsky> seems stupid to have them come
[23:51:02] <manicennui> comping?
[23:51:05] <dminkovsky> coming
[23:51:15] <manicennui> Thought it might be some new kind of camping.
[23:51:21] <dminkovsky> i can't focus on _anything_ last few days
[23:51:43] <dminkovsky> i've never gone camping
[23:51:50] <manicennui> Can they get refunds for any travel plans?
[23:51:56] <dminkovsky> closest i've come is watching john waters movies
[23:52:00] <dminkovsky> (mwahahaha)
[23:52:12] <manicennui> We went camping several times when I was growing up.
[23:52:15] <manicennui> Always really enjoyed it.
[23:52:19] <dminkovsky> they're driving and their hotel reservation can be cancelled
[23:52:25] <manicennui> Now I'd have to do glamping.
[23:52:29] <dminkovsky> it's more about the risks vs. benefits

[23:52:38] <buttsbot> Glamping - Wikipedia
[23:52:39] <dminkovsky> glamping sounds nice
[23:52:49] <manicennui> I can't deal with shitty bathrooms.
[23:52:57] <dminkovsky> if i was rich i'd for sure get one of those sweet mercedes vans
[23:53:19] <manicennui> Although overlanding seems attractive.
[23:53:27] <manicennui> I think it's just a fantasy for me though.
[23:53:28] <dminkovsky> what is overlanding
[23:53:44] <manicennui> Basically camping plus off-roading.
[23:53:57] <dminkovsky> i see
[23:54:02] <manicennui> Usually using some kind of tent that is attached to your vehicle.
[23:54:06] <dminkovsky> i have no desire to drive a vehicle offroad
[23:54:18] <manicennui> The idea is to get to more remote areas for camping.
[23:54:23] <dminkovsky> yeah my mercedes van would have one of those lean-tos
[23:54:52] <manicennui> This is what I want: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlanding#/media/File:Abenteuer_Allrad_2013_-_Unimog_437_U4000_6x6_RV_Unicat_MD52h.jpg
[23:54:52] <buttsbot> Overlanding - Wikipedia
[23:55:17] <dminkovsky> lol
[23:55:26] <dminkovsky> looks like a WWII vehicle
[23:55:28] <manicennui> There are some crazy vehicles out there.
[23:55:40] <dminkovsky> yeah that thing looks insane
[23:55:41] <manicennui> And of course a lot of overlanding channels on YT.
[23:55:43] <dminkovsky> i say that nicely
[23:55:59] <dminkovsky> i'm not trying to make fun of your, even hypothetical, desires
[23:56:10] <dminkovsky> 6X6!
[23:56:47] <dminkovsky> there's a good PBS movie about the first road trip across the US

[23:57:22] <dminkovsky> ^ now that's overlanding
[23:57:42] <manicennui> Nice.
[23:57:54] <dminkovsky> all the niche subscenes out there
[23:58:16] <dminkovsky> i stumbled upon the steel subscene last night cause of the HN post about some sharp knives
[23:58:35] <dminkovsky> all i care about is programming and since i don't care about programming anymore all i care about is nothing
[23:58:45] <manicennui> Yeah, I wish I were doing that stuff instead of staring at a screen all day.
[23:58:54] <dminkovsky> can't imagine getting into boutique steel sharpness
[23:58:57] <gwozniak> manicennui: "glamping" to me is camping with a car to hold your stuff
[23:59:30] <manicennui> gwozniak: I really mean a nice airbnb cabin that is somewhat secluded.
[23:59:44] <dminkovsky> semi-enclosed
