[00:54:27] <cobber> I'm a bit confused about fulfilling interfaces :-( I have defined a 2-layer interface: FileSystem and FileInfo - for testing I have a mock FileSystem with a func that returns a mock FileInfo - when I return a *mock.FileInfo struct go complains (*mock_fs.FileSystem does not implement expunger.FileSystem (wrong type for FileInfo method)), but if I define the func to return a FileInfo interface, all is well.
[00:54:57] <cobber> doesn't that contradict the "accept interfaces but provide structs" mantra?

[00:58:04] <seebs> it is an *exception* to it, because necessarily, the function in the interface has to return an interfacey type because we don't know which concrete type we want
[00:58:36] <cobber> hmmm...
[00:59:42] <Tv_> cobber: psst you probably want to use https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS instead
[00:59:45] <cobber> so the "not-quite-duck-typing" doesn't work in this case (becuase the mock implements all the required funcs plus a few more for testing)
[01:00:06] <Tv_> the function signatures have to actually match
[01:02:34] <cobber> tv: thanks, but my use-case calls for file information (ModTime(), Size()) as well as a unique hash - but doesn't actually care about the content of the files... so I have a minimal interface which just provides "FileInfo"s (not the same as io/fs)
[01:02:51] <cobber> but ok - the signature has to match... got it
[01:06:22] <cobber> thanks... working and hopefully I understand it bit better

[01:55:24] <b0nn> might be a version issue

[01:56:24] <b0nn> Where have you put your mock modules?
[01:56:27] <cobber> hmmm.... goimports doesn't seem to have a -version option :-(
[01:56:52] <hwrd> how do I log a json.Marshal'd map without all the newlines and escaped quotes?
[01:56:53] <b0nn> I normally have them in the _test package (because they're externaly to the interface)
[01:56:58] <cobber> they need refactoring :-) test/mock/...
[01:57:22] <b0nn> and fakes, of course are in the same package as the code, but in _test.go files
[01:58:02] <cobber> ? that works?
[01:58:28] <b0nn> so, _test.go files can be in the same package, or the _test package
[01:58:30] <cobber> I'll try...
[02:00:02] <bpalmer> cobber: multiple files can all be in the same package.  foo_test.go are similar to other build tags in file names; if you name a file foo_windows.go , for example, it won't by default be compiled on a unix system
[02:00:17] <bpalmer> So foo_test.go is only compiled when you're doing go test or explicitly building it
[02:01:22] <b0nn> also, build tags

[05:28:53] <fizzie> That's a little inconsistent; you said it's a map[string]interface{}, then that it's a map[string]map[string]interface{}.
[05:29:36] <fizzie> At any rate, if you absolutely can't avoid using those "dynamic" JSON types, what you'd do is type-assert the `interface{}` values in the map to the types you expect them to be.
[05:31:34] <fizzie> For pulling the 2 out of a {"a": {"b": 2}}, it could be a, ok := obj["a"] -> aMap, ok := a.(map[string]interface{}) -> b, ok := aMap["b"] -> bInt, ok := b.(int), with checks for `ok` at every point.
[05:32:28] <seebs> the other way to do it is, if you know what it is, unmarshal into the right type in the first place.
[05:32:45] <fizzie> But most of the time you'd really rather unmarshal JSON into more meaningful types. The `json.RawMessage` type can sometimes help if you need to look at some of it before deciding what kind of thing to unmarshal the rest.

[05:36:04] <fizzie> In particular, since extra fields in the incoming data not present in your target struct are ignored by default (when https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields is not set), you can use the model of unmarshalling into a struct type even if you're only interested in extracting one small piece of a document and can't be bothered to model all of it in Go types.

[17:53:41] <mrig> Hello
[17:53:58] <mrig> Is there a way to add a template to an existing template?
[17:55:23] <mrig> I am coming to better understand them now, but am having a little difficulty understanding how the set works within a template, and when or if you would make different templates rather than when multiple templates exist within a set generated by either parsing a glob or a list of files.

[18:35:18] <edrocks> how safe is it to start using the 1.18 beta from a syntax perspective
[18:35:46] <edrocks> ie is there potential generics get scrapped or the syntax changes before 1.18 release?
[18:46:13] <sztanpet> doubtful, but sure, if theres some major issue with them they will be backed out before the release
[18:46:49] <sztanpet> no real chance tho, also for the syntax changing
[18:50:58] <seebs> It's a beta. If they discover that something really, really, important blows up, they can and will scrap it.
[18:51:04] <seebs> It's not *likely*.
