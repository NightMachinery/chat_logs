[00:00:38] <imode> federation/networked instances are a better model. you need centralization somewhere.
[00:01:43] <imode> though ring topology P2P stuff is fascinating.
[00:04:12] <riv> got my game controller, it works!
[00:05:06] <indigo> Agreed. None of these things are useless, but they’re not that great either
[00:07:38] <indigo> Brekkjern: who needs types if you spend all day solving toy problems????
[00:08:39] <imode> ironically much typed stuff is used exclusively in toy problems.
[00:08:55] <companion_cube> Now that's flamebait ;)
[00:08:56] <imode> hate me all you want, you know I'm right. :P
[00:09:20] <companion_cube> Depends what you mean by "typed stuff" really?
[00:09:24] <imode> yeh.
[00:12:41] <Brekkjern> I like the type hinting in Python. That works well for my use.

[02:43:31] <indigo> What a cute kitty!
[02:47:39] <skyl4rk> Hm, I kind of dislike federated networks, as afaict they leak personal information, and/or can become silos, e.g. if I (me::rainbowpower.tld) want to share cat pictures with my grandma (gm::ultraconservative.tld) I might communicate more information than I want to, and that to begin with presupposes that the two groups federate to begin with.
[02:48:52] <skyl4rk> I agree on the cuteness of the cat..
[02:51:24] <gwozniak> I saw a 6-month old cat up for adoption at the pet store when I went to get some cat food and I was very tempted to adopt a 3rd cat
[02:51:50] <indigo> Awww
[02:51:59] <indigo> What kind of cat was it :D
[02:53:42] <gwozniak> Don't know the breed, but it was all black, male, had orange-ish eyes, and was very, very calm
[02:55:24] <indigo> I love black cats
[03:02:07] <gwozniak> Don't think my wife would have been a fan of adopting another cat without being consulted ;)
[03:02:29] <gwozniak> Also, two cats is enough for the space we have
[03:02:41] <kline> skyl4rk, the cool thing about federation is that if you dont want to send someone info, then dont
[03:02:57] <kline> a centralised network could overcommunicate just the same
[03:03:18] <kline> i agree that federation is overhyped and certainly on the fediverse created more problems than it solved
[03:03:28] <skyl4rk> I'm not arguing for centralization, but for further decentralization.
[03:03:45] <kline> fully p2p?
[03:03:53] <skyl4rk> kind-of-but-eh
[03:03:59] <kline> im interested, sincerely
[03:04:29] <skyl4rk> I'm currently at the level beej's guide to network programming + trying to understand libsodium ---> some kind of poc/mvp
[03:05:27] <kline> but youre ok to talk about the model?
[03:05:34] <kline> even if you dont have a poc
[03:05:34] <skyl4rk> yeah sure
[03:06:39] <skyl4rk> I mean the point is an open protocol rather than a platform, even open, the thing about wanting to make some sort of mvp/poc is about not painting myself as the infamous "ideas man" archetype
[03:08:29] <skyl4rk> I'm not even interested in the protocol, more about the topology, and even the topology is not necessarily as important as the guiding principles that made me arrive at the particular topology, that I now in turn try to figure out a protocol to implement.
[03:09:38] <skyl4rk> ...but perhaps I should actually try to write down my thoughts and give you a link once somewhat coherent.
[03:10:37] <kline> thatd be good
[03:11:04] <kline> im working on some software just now that will have to be interoperable so im keen to hear about models people have so i can minimally shoot my foot
[03:11:28] <skyl4rk> I also suspect that there is some amount of overlap with the ideas around the solid project, although solid want's to bring the whole web into it, and I don't care about bringing /any/ of the web into it.
[03:14:26] <skyl4rk> (not that I'd mind a web-implementation, it's just not my domain)
[03:21:08] <Brekkjern> Man, I am glad Arcane got picked up for a season 2
[03:21:50] <Brekkjern> That show is beyond beautiful
[03:22:02] <kline> we've got an arcan v2?
[03:22:07] <kline> how many new WMs?
[03:22:35] <imode> lol.
[03:22:59] <Brekkjern> I'm sorry, there is still not any arcan v1
[03:24:15] <Brekkjern> But if you have Netflix, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least give it a chance
[03:26:21] <kline> theres an rms copypaste about netflix and chill, i cant be bothered finding it so please think about it in your head

[03:28:37] <imode> the bird thing was unprompted and uh.
[03:28:40] <imode> this dude is wild.
[03:31:47] <Brekkjern> I don't get why people consider his opinions?
[03:32:02] <Brekkjern> I understand that the original email is probably a troll, but still
[03:35:05] <Brekkjern> Also, his opinions of Netflix are irrelevant to the topic of Arcane being a must watch or not :)
[03:35:32] <Brekkjern> To be honest, his opinions are irrelevant to begin with 🤔
[03:39:19] <dimadima> that stallman correspondence was PGP-encrypted but that did nothing against the ol' screenshot
[03:39:29] <dimadima> screenshot wins agains
[03:40:28] <dimadima> what doesn't the screenshot defeat? steganography? think again
[03:41:37] <Brekkjern> It doesn't get my steganography implementation :)
[03:41:43] <companion_cube> are RMS emails NFT-able?
[03:41:56] <Brekkjern> But then again, the entire point of my implementation is that it doesn't get rendered
[03:42:00] <imode> why wouldn't they be, companion_cube.

[14:37:46] <buttsbot> Twitter - __eater__ - still low key annoyed at what weird expectations people have of open source projects
[14:39:30] <Brekkjern> >THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS",
[14:40:36] <Brekkjern> Also, their name on Twitter is "mashed potato eater" which I find funny
[14:41:37] <riv> lol
[14:45:39] <riv> I totally disagree. I think you should document your stuff and you're only hurting your own project by not doing so
[14:45:52] <Brekkjern> Sure. I agree.
[14:46:20] <Brekkjern> But if I have provided something and it's "lacking" documentation
[14:46:26] <Brekkjern> What then?
[14:46:29] <riv> also I don;'t think it's about entitlement or anything, its more like "oh this looked great but I literally can't use it or contribute to it - because the experts that deeply understand it wrote nothing down"
[14:46:50] <Geekingfrog> Personally I think it really depends on your goals. If your goal is to try some ideas and code something "for fun", then no, there's zero expectation of doc, and "hurting the project" is irrelevant.
[14:46:52] <Brekkjern> It is provided "as is", and any documentation is further work that you are demanding I do instead of doing it yourself
[14:46:54] <riv> a lot of people don't realize how much they know
[14:47:49] <riv> yeah that's important, there's throwaway/hobby project type things - im just thinking about code people put up with the intention of contributing to the free software ecosystem
[14:47:58] <Brekkjern> I absolutely understand that documentation is necessary, I write it for my own shit as well, but I also don't see what "hey! You should write documentation for this!" adds to the conversation because I am aware that there aren't any.
[14:48:23] <Brekkjern> It's not like documentation is this tiny part of software writing that you can just go "Oh shit! I forgot about that entirely!"
[14:48:38] <riv> the thing about docs specifically though, wrt. open source is it's something that an outsider or newcomer can basically not contribute
[14:48:50] <riv> yeah

[17:37:15] <gwozniak> Lack of decent documentation is one of my biggest gripes with pretty much all software.  Saying "it's a lot of work that is not coding and thus doesn't feel productive to me" tells me a lot, though
[17:38:00] <gwozniak> The idea that only coding is productive is the real problem here
[17:38:41] <Brekkjern> Well, yes, but it is also entirely unpaid labour that people do on their free time without any compensation
[17:39:06] <gwozniak> This isn't an open source only thing to me, mind
[17:41:03] <companion_cube> if you write code for fun, documentation is just a chore
[17:41:18] <Brekkjern> I don't disagree that documentation is prioritized less than it should be, but in the context of me writing something and putting it on GitHub for others to use, no strings attached... Who are you to tell me that I should spend more of my time doing something for free for you than I have already done?
[17:43:10] <Brekkjern> If I published code without documentation, then I am aware I did so. If someone creates an issue about it you are going to get one of three responses, all depending on my mood:
[17:43:10] <Brekkjern> 1. Sure, I'm in a good mood and the request is for some part that I find easy to document so I will do it.
[17:43:10] <Brekkjern> 2. Eh. Can't be bothered to even read the issue.
[17:43:10] <Brekkjern> 3. Close issue - Won't fix.
[17:44:19] <gwozniak> I don't care about docs for those kinds of things
[17:46:07] <gwozniak> And frankly, the chances of me choosing to rely on such a project would be very low
[17:47:10] <gerikson> Documentation: Cryptic / Lacking / Incorrect
[17:47:12] <Brekkjern> buttsbot relies on at least two such projects
[17:47:15] <gerikson> choose any three
[17:47:35] <Brekkjern> It's a pain in the ass, but at least I can read the code to figure out how to do it.
[17:49:26] <gwozniak> GCC's Internal docs come to mind as an example here
[17:49:35] <gwozniak> They exist, but...
[17:51:24] <gwozniak> You get stuff like this, where reading the code is so cryptic it's days worth of work in some cases and you don't know the ramifications of changing something: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Library-Files.html#Library-Files
[17:51:24] <buttsbot> Library Files (GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals)
[17:55:57] <gwozniak> And then there's the stuff that's out of date or just wrong, and subtlely wrong so you don't catch it if you're looking at the code
[18:10:24] <ngoldbaum> one reason i’m a fan of doctests is there’s a higher likelihood i’ll notice when the docs go out of date because a code example somewhere in the docs broke
[18:11:00] <ngoldbaum> static docs with no tests and lots of code examples are pretty much guaranteed to have bugs in the examples

[18:50:06] <indigo> I appreciate how opinionated Caddy is
[18:50:38] <companion_cube> seems like it's not packaged on my old debian :((
[18:50:41] <companion_cube> on my VPS i mean
[18:50:45] <companion_cube> now that's sad
[18:51:10] <riv> what i dont get is why is it not just a thing that uses nginx
[18:51:18] <riv> they had to make a whole new webserver?
[18:54:01] <indigo> Maybe they wanted greater memory safety by writing it in Go?
[18:59:16] <indigo> Also layering a config layer on top of nginx seems more complicated to me, as you’ll always be playing catch-up with nginx
[19:00:16] <riv> but go doesnt have generics
[19:01:16] <indigo> Now you are just trolling :P
[19:02:06] <defect> memory management in nginx plugins isn't too bad actually since the code is scoped to a single request. you ask nginx for a bit of memory and then it just automatically discards everything at the end of the request
[19:05:00] <gwozniak> gerikson: similiar. I don't know all the ins and outs of HTTPS, but even with lighttpd I was able to get it up and running with a cert without much effort
[19:07:25] <Brekkjern> TLS is honestly pretty simple. That's really not where the complexity comes in.

[19:16:31] <companion_cube> not that I used them that much
[19:16:40] <riv> i used to love cassette, i thought it sounded fine
[19:16:41] <indigo> Vinyl sounds OK; it just doesn’t hold much depending on the speed
[19:17:08] <gwozniak> I was in music production when the CD transition was really starting and I can remember people debating whether vinyl sounded better than CD, but no one ever said cassette sounded good in comparison
[19:17:37] <riv> cassette is definitely lower quality
[19:18:12] <gwozniak> All the music producers, engineers and musicians I hung out with at the time did not miss cassette being pushed out

[19:18:25] <gwozniak> Yeah
[19:18:58] <gwozniak> Must be to get the hipster money, because I'll bet the music sounds "meh"
[19:19:01] <riv> the thing that's nice about casette is you can read and write them

[19:20:46] <skyl4rk> so for going old-school cassettes is the cheaper option production wise
[19:25:40] <gwozniak> The not fun thing about editing tape is keeping track of all the tape segments you remove from the primary recording
[19:27:10] <gwozniak> And then being mindful of adhering those pieces together again.  Easy to get a little skip or bump
[19:58:48] <gwozniak> ``208 updates can be applied immediately. 111 of these updates are standard security updates.''
[19:58:55] <gwozniak> Love our internal machines...
[20:06:19] <indigo> Woof
[20:06:33] <indigo> Are these your build machines?
[20:06:36] <gwozniak> No one manages or updates them
[20:06:44] <gwozniak> This one might be, yes
[20:06:53] <indigo> I think Ubuntu has an auto update setting
[20:08:06] <gwozniak> I have root access, but so do a lot of other people and I don't want to just start doing all this stuff without talking to them first.  It's not super important at the moment, but leaving the machine like this over time is probably not a great idea
[20:08:18] <indigo> For sure

[21:00:44] <indigo> Ahhh finally got through my emails
[21:09:06] <ewintr> Regarding cassettes, I actually am that weirdo that still uses cassette tapes in a non-ironic way. Not every day but regularly.
[21:10:00] <ewintr> My opinion on the sound: definitly not as good as cd or vinyl.
[21:11:50] <ewintr> Apart from the quality of the mechanism itself, there is also to consider that a lot of the decks are not built that well. As in: maybe the tape does not have that much noise, but the machine that plays it buzzes.
[21:13:04] <ewintr> And if you wonder why I still use them then: Years ago I suffered from insomnia and one of the cures was to completely get rid of all internet in my living room.
[21:13:48] <ewintr> But I wanted more music than just albums. So I now rip live concerts and DJ mixes from Youtube and put them on a cassette.
[21:35:38] <defect> why a cassette though? wouldn't it be easier to burn it on to a cd these days?
[21:36:38] <indigo> defect: Retro
[22:10:22] <prussian> 2 retro 4 me
[22:10:32] <prussian> really? cassettes are cool again?
[22:10:52] <prussian> clearly I need to get cassette backup tapes as well.
[22:16:38] <edm> do you think CDs will have their time or does it need to be analogue for their mental model of authenticity
[22:17:26] <edm> (not talking about ewintr here, just the general retro fashion for vinyl and cassettes)
[22:24:56] <prussian> fuck I don't know. lmao
[22:25:10] <prussian> I will never understand this nostalgic collector hobby stuff.
[22:25:21] <prussian> but ya, CDs are big lame probably.
[22:40:02] <ewintr> Yes, cd's would work too. As do minidisks and an old iPod, I guess.
[22:40:41] <ewintr> But it should not be too fancy. One part is no internet, but the other is the no skipping or random play part.
[22:41:15] <dimadima> haven't tried this yet but excited to https://twitter.com/SurajKapoor/status/1465396053583167492
[22:41:15] <buttsbot> Twitter - SurajKapoor - In Chrome, copy and paste...  chrome://dino/  🤯
[22:41:34] <ewintr> I noticed back then then listening to a whole album is much more relaxing than random play. Even when both happen in the background.
[22:42:01] <ewintr> But I'll admit that I like retro tech, so maybe it is part excuse, part fun.
[22:42:31] <dimadima> oh it's this game; i thought they built dino into chrome. very disappointed
[22:42:39] <dimadima> or not...

[22:45:24] <defect> ewintr: yeah, i get that. i tend to listen to albums, but i also pause all the time because i get distracted by some dumb video or something
[22:45:52] <ewintr> The fun in retro tech: achieving a result in a different way than you're used too. Most of the time with using less resources than the modern version.
[22:48:13] <ewintr> Or I should say: with less complicated machinery. That old hifi can use a lot of electricity.
