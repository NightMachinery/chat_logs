[12:35:38] <merit> hi - real new to radios, still
[12:35:53] <merit> I've got a pretty simple OOK signal I'm trying to piece together a decoder for in GRC
[12:36:34] <merit> I've got the actual amplitude looking like square waves and ready to turn into digital bits but am not 100% sure I'm going the right way on decoding
[12:36:48] <merit> can the symbol sync block deal with an ook signal that's not manchester encoded?
[12:36:49] <merit> ie
[12:36:58] <merit> it's just simple on or off, so you can end up with the clock all dumb
[12:38:55] <merit> else, do I need to come up with my own python code to handle it?
