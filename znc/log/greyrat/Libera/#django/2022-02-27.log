[03:33:48] <Siecje> jim: The form will have errors, you can display them in the template, either going through the form or the field.
[03:36:19] <jim> I dunno if you're familiar with this, I'm trying to use crispy forms for django, it seems to do a better job at rendering the form than django itself... but, like django, django+crispy forms also doesn't display the errors
[03:37:44] <Siecje> Can you pastebin the template?

[03:42:50] <Siecje> Are you able to see the errors in the view?
[03:42:58] <Siecje> But then the template doesn't render them?
[03:43:04] <jim> no, there'sd no sign of them
[03:43:36] <jim> is there a way I can see evidence they're present?
[03:44:16] <jim> can I sequence through a list of the elements and create a list of form element error strings?
[03:44:40] <Siecje> yes
[03:45:02] <Siecje> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/forms/api/#django.forms.Form.errors
[03:46:06] <jim> is it possible that is_valid() would add errors?
[03:47:03] <jim> (stated another way: should I get the errors from the form, before or after calling is_valid()?)
[03:48:57] <jim> or does the order even matter
[03:50:19] <Siecje> It validates.
[03:50:38] <Siecje> Are you passing data to the form?
[03:52:17] <jim> sometimes yes, but that's only when the request says the method is POST

[07:13:19] <yanchai> hi everyone!
[07:13:32] <yanchai> i currently have an app using mysql as db
[07:14:04] <yanchai> now that i need to implement asgi using websockets do i need to use redis or i can still use mysql to store my notifications?

[07:16:37] <FunkyBob> yanchai: AIUI you might only need redis as a message broker... and even then only if your ASGI server needs it
[07:17:49] <yanchai> FunkyBob: meaning i can use both mysql for my db and redis for notif?
[07:18:02] <FunkyBob> it's not clear
[07:18:02] *** Quits: ubernostrum (~jbennett@75-37-202-116.lightspeed.snmtca.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[07:18:13] <FunkyBob> are these 'notifications' something to do with your app?
[07:18:22] <FunkyBob> what is it makes you think you need redis at all?
[07:18:26] <yanchai> yes
[07:18:50] <yanchai> like if someone added a new entry on a model it will notify another user that something happened to that model
[07:19:12] <yanchai> realtime notification
[07:21:51] <FunkyBob> so in your question you seem to have almost completely avoided asking about the actual problem ... :/
[07:23:29] <FunkyBob> yanchai: are you trying to figure out what will make it easiest to notify relevant users when a new notice is posted?

[12:25:17] <Lartza> Not sure where you are seeing it's required, but why do you not want to use redis?
[12:25:30] <Lartza> Redis is much much much much faster

[12:32:51] <yanchai> coz i have an existing django app using mysql db
[12:33:18] <yanchai> and i just want to have a real time notification on the admin when a user sends a request document
[12:36:06] <yanchai> is it possible to use redis for caching only while using channels and mysql for the data models?
[12:37:45] *** Joins: blackout69 (~blackout6@net-109-117-245-37.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[12:38:53] <ktosiek> yanchai: you need some way to send data from the process that saves the document to the process that handles the WebSicket. That's what Channels uses Redis for.

[12:40:46] <ktosiek> Your data will live in mysql, Redis will be used for broadcasting small messages to let your ASGI handlers know there's some work to do
[12:45:21] <bnrt> How do I redirect to a particular id on a html page? I have this function: return redirect(get_page, page_id), this redirects to mypage/page1 but I need it to redirect to mypage/page1#45
[12:50:09] <Lartza> Yeah redis is not a mysql replacement
[12:51:08] <ktosiek> bnrt: I think you can use reverse(...) +'#45' as the URL in redirect()

[13:18:40] <yanchai> thanks ktosiek
[13:19:15] <yanchai> i was worried that it might interfer my mysql db
[13:19:32] <yanchai> is it safe to say to use wsgi and asgi side by side in prod?
[13:19:46] <yanchai> i only use asgi for notifications using channels websockets
[13:21:55] <yanchai> ktosiek: thanks mate
[13:26:08] <ktosiek> By "side by side", do you mean you want to run separate asgi and wsgi servers? Sure, that should work well. Usual caveats about horizontal scaling apply here (avoid in-memory cache, avoid keeping state in global variables, use transaction.on_commit where it makes sense)
[13:27:06] <ktosiek> You'll need to configure your reverse proxy to send specific URLs to your ASGI server, but that's about it
[13:29:52] <jim> what do people generally think of "the django book", other than the fact it kinda rhymes with "the jungle book"?

[13:34:59] <yanchai> ktosiek: is it possible to use 1 server for api and http with realtime notification?
[13:35:02] <hop> what do i have to set to change a ModelChoiceFields (radio widget) "required" error message?
[13:36:14] <ktosiek> yanchai: yes, Django even provides an ASGI entrypoint just like they provide one for WSGI
[13:36:17] <yanchai> ktosiek: current my django app is running using wsgi with drf for the android scanner but there is a portal for students to check for their document's request status. now i need to implement the real time notification
[13:38:05] <hop> let me rephrase that… i did set `error_messages = {'my_field': {'required': 'my error'}}` but the default error message still shows up
[13:38:21] <yanchai> ktosiek: what i mean is i have api for the scanner, a web portal for students both using wsgi but now need to implement realtime notifications using channels and my concern is, since django channels websockets use asgi would it interfere my wsgi web portal?
[13:38:21] <hop> *in MyForm.Meta
[13:39:50] <ktosiek> yanchai: you have 2 options here: 1. run your whole app under ASGI, Django can do that, or 2. run the ASGI part in a separate process, and use your reverse proxy (nginx?) to route traffic to the right one.
[13:40:20] <ktosiek> I'm currently testing the 1st option, and it seems to work. The second one will not affect your current app, so it might be even nicer
[13:40:22] <hop> hm. setting it as argument to the field does work. inconvenient, but i can work with it
