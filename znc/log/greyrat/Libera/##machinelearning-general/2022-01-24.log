[05:53:44] <hodapp> INRIA seems to put out some quality stuff
[05:54:05] <hodapp> though this is the first I've seen that they did anything with sklearn rather than with their own package, SciLab
[05:54:25] <mefistofeles> yeah, they commonly push towards their own tools, that's true
[05:55:01] <mefistofeles> I don't know what's the status of scilab for machine learning stuff, though. I doubt it's as complete as scikit-learn
[06:00:31] <hodapp> probably about on par with something like MATLAB
[06:02:33] <mefistofeles> hmm, even that would be surprising, comparing how much more matlab is used over scilab

[16:10:48] <lericson> since you're doing partial derivatives, you're computing the gradient

[16:28:13] <Hunts> precisely
[16:28:45] <Jong> I wasn't complaining I was just asking.  I do wish, however, that experts in cs / ai / ml cared more about language and see its importance.
[16:29:51] <mefistofeles> Jong: haha that's fine, we were mostly joking. Formality is important, but also knowing when is not required allows for developments without having to spend hours on the linguistics and notation
[16:30:18] <Jong> good point
[16:30:58] <mefistofeles> it is common that these things abuse the language or notation, and then the dust settles to something "reasonable" over time
[16:31:10] <mefistofeles> I mean, at first the abuse is common
