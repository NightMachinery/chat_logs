[02:08:32] <rickame> what are form handling best practices now? still save client ip and user agent or? 
[02:10:07] <stenno> what do you mean with 'form handling' ?
[02:10:16] <stenno> saving UA can never be best practise
[02:10:51] <rickame> why not?
[02:11:02] <rickame> isnt that helpful to know what browsers to support?
[02:11:06] <stenno> because clients can choose their UA at will
[02:11:15] <rickame> well ya ofc
[02:11:16] <stenno> well then can you specify what you mean with 'form handling'
[02:11:55] <rickame> then for client ip i wanted to save it to blacklist spammer ips
[02:14:09] <stenno> what do you mean with 'form handling'
[02:14:23] <rickame> when ppl come to my site and post a form
[02:14:32] <stenno> oh
[02:14:42] <stenno> this channel is about html
[02:14:55] <rickame> i wanted to save user agent to get SOME idea of what browsers my visitors use, then save client ip to be abel to ban spammers
[02:15:01] <rickame> ya html forms
[02:15:11] <stenno> but usually just throttling requests is way to go
[02:15:28] <stenno> your webserver saves the ips for you
[02:15:35] <rickame> when you make form submission code you don't save client ip and user agent?
[02:15:41] <stenno> no lmao
[02:16:34] <stenno> anyway, this is more a question about webservers and not about html

[02:18:39] <rickame> throttle requests how?
[02:19:34] <stenno> depends on your webserver
[02:21:39] <rickame> ok ill take your advice stenno and not save user agent and client ip with form post
[02:21:51] <rickame> so when you take form post you only take form data and nothing else? what about time stamp?
[02:23:05] <stenno> again, this channel is about html. you are asking about data processing which depends on a lot of things
[02:23:24] <rickame> where do you wanna talk about it?
[02:23:29] <stenno> your questions are so vague and without any context so its impossible to give good advice
[02:23:30] <rickame> slide in my dms?
[02:23:35] <stenno> i do not want to talk about it at all
