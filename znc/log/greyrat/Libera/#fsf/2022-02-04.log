[03:55:56] <Kaiod> An example of this type (although bad) is Tails which does this on a USB stick, which is where I intend to do mine.
[03:55:56] <Kaiod> I can install it on the USB stick, no problem.

[05:34:58] <tpefreedom> What's bad about trisquel 10? I'm curious since I have not tried it yet.
[05:35:20] <iShareFreedom> for my, is more slow and have a little bugs for my computer

[08:04:01] <iShareFreedom> if you have amdgpu they go to force your instalation to install malware.
[08:04:18] <iShareFreedom> aka nonfree software in blobs
[08:04:21] <DiffieHellman> labrador: I compile things with -march=native and -O3, so binary distros just feel slow 
[08:04:25] <labrador> iShareFreedom, not really I had to go and install all my blobs manually thank you
[08:04:44] <labrador> DiffieHellman, I'd rather not compile things...my computer is too slow
[08:04:47] *** Quits: xiews (~wxie@116.232.33.53) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:04:51] <iShareFreedom> the only distros you can install and share with ethic and morality are the free distros.
[08:04:54] <DiffieHellman> iShareFreedom: Don't install amdgpu then? That's the only way for amdgpu to work and they say that. Use radeonsi instead
[08:05:11] <iShareFreedom> i dont install nonfree software
[08:05:26] <iShareFreedom> im in a free distro, and im completly against all nonfree software
[08:05:45] <labrador> sure do that but realize you need compromises irl
[08:05:59] <iShareFreedom> compromises what
[08:06:33] <labrador> of using more mainstream distros...of running blobs...etc
[08:06:54] <iShareFreedom> you are sharing the ideas about nonfree software as a good idea to do with your example

[08:07:24] <DiffieHellman> How so when I'm expressily noting that there is temptation that must be resisted?
[08:07:36] <labrador> Well I think free OS w/ blobs > Proprietary OS
[08:07:39] <labrador> So yes
[08:07:44] <tpefreedom> What about installing lfs (without any nonfree software)? (Should be glfs)
[08:07:49] <iShareFreedom> you cant have a free distro with blobs
[08:08:07] <labrador> People will run back to windows if linux cannot even run their machine to its full capablitity
[08:08:08] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Same thing, but there are levels of proprietary.
[08:08:15] <tpefreedom> labrador, and a free OS w/o blobbc > free OS w/ blobs
[08:08:16] <iShareFreedom> the only ones free distros are: https://gnu.org/distros
[08:08:34] <DiffieHellman> It's better to be 1% proprietary than 100% proprietary, but the target is 0%
[08:08:35] <labrador> Like not have wifi..or a display...or bluetooth etc
[08:08:51] <DiffieHellman> labrador: *GNU/Linux
[08:09:11] <iShareFreedom> dont correct him
[08:09:12] <Andrew> labrador: My computer doesn't run gnu/linux on full capability
[08:09:18] <iShareFreedom> he dont want freedom, he want wifi
[08:09:23] <Andrew> But I never considered switching back to windows
[08:09:34] <iShareFreedom> that is what he want, and im not against him and his ideas, about for me that are bad
[08:09:36] <labrador> tpefreedom, sure but security is important too...you'll drive away security researchers when you do not allow microcode updates
[08:09:49] <labrador> Or firmware updates etc
[08:09:53] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Eh, microcode updates are pretty much useless.
[08:09:57] <iShareFreedom> all nonfree software are malware
[08:10:00] <iShareFreedom> or possible malware
[08:10:08] <iShareFreedom> so you cant have security with him
[08:10:11] <labrador> DiffieHellman, na they patch up stuff like spectre and meltdown
[08:10:13] <DiffieHellman> Any processor vulns aren't an issue if you only run free softare
[08:10:32] <labrador> DiffieHellman, not really...go say that to a sec guy and see what response you get lol
[08:10:42] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary software are likey to use spectre and meltdown, good free software won't.
[08:11:04] <AwesomeAdam54321> labrador: When it comes to Wifi, a wireless USB adapter can be used: https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb
[08:11:18] <labrador> Nothing says that free software can't be malware
[08:11:43] <iShareFreedom> free software dont have warranty so, of your free distro is part of a community, or you make your own support or you dont have support
[08:11:52] <DiffieHellman> labrador: It can be, but in that case, you installed malware34 and that's exactly what you asked.
[08:12:04] <iShareFreedom> or the other option labrador, is pay to others to make support to you
[08:12:06] <DiffieHellman> 3>He doesn't read the source of every program you use.
[08:12:09] <labrador> iShareFreedom, yes and debian literally is the largest distro
[08:12:18] <labrador> It has about 60k packages in its repos
[08:12:28] <iShareFreedom> debian is nonfree distro
[08:12:28] <labrador> So you'll get everything you need
[08:12:36] <labrador> iShareFreedom, also the largest one...
[08:12:37] <iShareFreedom> all i need is freedom
[08:12:46] <iShareFreedom> wifi?
[08:12:49] <iShareFreedom> haha!
[08:12:54] <labrador> iShareFreedom, people need a working computer lol
[08:12:57] <DiffieHellman> I'll take both freedom and speed.
[08:13:02] <iShareFreedom> people deserve freedom 
[08:13:07] <iShareFreedom> more than work
[08:13:26] <labrador> Uhh most people won't agree with you iShareFreedom on your assessment of what they need
[08:13:45] <iShareFreedom> if you are agree with my ideas arent important
[08:13:48] <iShareFreedom> for me or for others
[08:14:03] <iShareFreedom> my ideals are completly about moral and ethic way about using your computer
[08:14:06] <DiffieHellman> Most won't, but you need to expressily inform that x needs y piece of proprietary malware and z computer needs to be bought to solve that issue.
[08:14:26] <iShareFreedom> if you want use your computer with malware, you can do it, you can sell your freedom, but that is somethingi dont recommend.
[08:14:33] <iShareFreedom> something*
[08:14:44] <labrador> DiffieHellman, and debian does that,it isn't installed by default so you need to read the kernel logs and see what needs to be installed
[08:14:45] <DiffieHellman> Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[08:14:50] <labrador> Thats information enough
[08:14:59] <iShareFreedom> Pureos is the directly replacement to debian
[08:15:07] <iShareFreedom> becouse debian arent a free distro
[08:15:26] <DiffieHellman> Linux by default doesn't seem to have any proprietary firmware within anymore, but it does have a bunch of drivers that are only useful with that.
[08:15:47] <iShareFreedom> the kernel isnt the only one problem of debian
[08:15:47] <DiffieHellman> Your own make menuconfig tailored for your hardware solves that though.
[08:15:53] <iShareFreedom> debian support, share and recommend malware
[08:16:17] *** Quits: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:16:19] <iShareFreedom> Free distributions (or âdistrosâ) of the GNU/Linux system only include and only propose free software. They reject nonfree applications, nonfree programming platforms, nonfree drivers, nonfree firmware âblobs,â and any other nonfree software and documentation. If they discover that by mistake some had been included, they remove it. 
[08:16:33] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, then do note that it's unofficcial, but you are correct that they don't say that it's malware enough.
[08:16:36] <tpefreedom> iShareFreedom, a LOT of people dislike GNOME, so pureos might not be the best recommendation
[08:16:43] <iShareFreedom> pureos have kde too
[08:16:52] <iShareFreedom> if you want mate you have trisquel
[08:16:53] <labrador> GNOME is cool
[08:17:00] <tpefreedom> I'm personally not all that invested but GNOME is quite polarizing
[08:17:21] <iShareFreedom> if you want more options like without systemd you can install parabola
[08:17:26] <iShareFreedom> or hyperbola
[08:17:37] <tpefreedom> or guix
[08:17:50] <iShareFreedom> yes but gnu guix is for advanced users
[08:17:55] <labrador> Or just use artix I guess
[08:18:04] <labrador> Its a binary distro without systemd
[08:18:04] <iShareFreedom> lol
[08:18:09] <Andrew> labrador: Nah, use parabola if you can
[08:18:17] <tpefreedom> Well hypeerbola and parabola are not exactly inviting to new users either
[08:18:20] <Andrew> Artix, but free
[08:18:26] <DiffieHellman> I tried out Guix, but that's not up to scratch - for mupdf it automatically installs mujs, which only usage is running proprieatry JavaScript in pdf's
[08:18:26] <Andrew> tpefreedom: Neither is artix
[08:18:39] <iShareFreedom> hyperbola & parabola are more user friendly than gnu guix
[08:18:43] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: That's right, but I can live without a pdf reader
[08:19:03] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: It depends on your background
[08:19:09] <Andrew> If you are a Lisper/Schemer, you'd find Guix much easier
[08:19:10] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: mupdf can be compiled without JavaScript support just fine, Guix doesn't provide that option - meanwhile Gentoo does.
[08:19:21] <Andrew> Of course gentoo does [tm]
[08:19:25] <iShareFreedom> im speaking about user friendly Andrew
[08:19:45] <labrador> The easiest distros would be mint or something
[08:19:48] <iShareFreedom> no for about advanced users
[08:19:49] <labrador> Or elementary OS
[08:19:56] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: Again, it depends on the user's background
[08:19:57] <iShareFreedom> lol
[08:20:01] <DiffieHellman> Isn't mint nonfree out of the box?
[08:20:06] <labrador> yes
[08:20:07] <Andrew> labrador: I find chicken-csi and ghci to be friendly
[08:20:08] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Yes, it is
[08:20:09] <iShareFreedom> stop sharing and promotion malware labrador, please
[08:20:35] <Andrew> Lets see if there's any projects that wanna make mint free
[08:20:37] <iShareFreedom> here is the fsf chat, you dont feel the ideals about free software movement? xD
[08:20:45] <Andrew> Ugh, let me get myself unbanned on my own IRC network first.
[08:20:50] <iShareFreedom> the mint replacement is Trisquel
[08:20:56] <iShareFreedom> the Ubuntu replacement is Trisquel
[08:21:10] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: Not exactly
[08:21:15] <iShareFreedom> ok dude
[08:21:18] <Andrew> You don't get all the newbie applications with Mint
[08:21:18] <iShareFreedom> you are troling
[08:21:29] <iShareFreedom> im against mint
[08:21:30] <tpefreedom> Uruk GNU/Linux is also in the middle of certification iirc
[08:21:33] <Andrew> lol "trol(l)ing"
[08:21:35] <iShareFreedom> im just promotion real free distros.
[08:21:36] <Andrew> Uruk? Hmm
[08:21:48] <iShareFreedom> im completly against nonfree distros
[08:21:54] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: I'm not promoting Mint, I'm talking about what free distros who target newbies need
[08:21:55] <labrador> Its so easy(mint) becuz it 'just werks'
[08:21:59] <labrador> And that requires blobs
[08:22:03] <Andrew> No
[08:22:13] <iShareFreedom> the most new users distro are Trisquel and PureOS

[08:22:19] <Andrew> You can have all the software "just werks" parts work without blobs
[08:22:29] <labrador> Andrew, not if your wifi doesn't work...
[08:22:36] <labrador> That would be frustating for someone
[08:22:40] <labrador> Who doesn't understand
[08:22:43] <iShareFreedom> buy a ethernet cable
[08:22:46] <Andrew> labrador: I helped people replace WiFi cards before
[08:22:50] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Just write a free software firmware implementation, easy
[08:23:03] <DiffieHellman> iShareFreedom: Ethernet is a protocol you know? Did you mean cat6 UTP?
[08:23:05] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Not exactly easy when the specs are nowhere
[08:23:24] <iShareFreedom> isnt important for me the technical issue
[08:23:27] <labrador> DiffieHellman, first go tell that guy he needs to do that and see what he does to you :D
[08:23:59] <DiffieHellman> labrador: They'd probably beg me to do it and I just might.
[08:24:10] <iShareFreedom> ok now i see
[08:24:16] <DiffieHellman> Anyone know of any non-stupid 802.11n implementation?
[08:24:17] <iShareFreedom> with people like labdrador
[08:24:27] <iShareFreedom> this fsf chat looks a debian chat 
[08:24:31] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: No
[08:24:31] <DiffieHellman> *implementations
[08:24:31] <iShareFreedom> xd
[08:24:54] <labrador> iShareFreedom, its just an easy distro
[08:24:56] <DiffieHellman> I have a look at that IEEE 802.11n-2009 spec and I say the 500 pages and closed it.
[08:25:01] <labrador> You don't have to run debian
[08:25:02] <DiffieHellman> *saw
[08:25:02] <iShareFreedom> labrador
[08:25:05] <iShareFreedom> i go to block you
[08:25:09] <labrador> You could run fedora or something
[08:25:10] <iShareFreedom> im bored about your promotion
[08:25:12] <iShareFreedom> of malware
[08:25:15] <iShareFreedom> how i can block him
[08:25:17] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: "Promotion"
[08:25:18] <iShareFreedom> what is the command 
[08:25:20] <labrador> iShareFreedom, its not malware man
[08:25:29] <DiffieHellman> labrador: It is malware, but okay.
[08:25:30] <iShareFreedom> what is the command
[08:25:33] <iShareFreedom> for block him
[08:25:37] <labrador> iShareFreedom, /ignore labrador 
[08:25:39] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: I don't know Icedove commands
[08:25:40] <DiffieHellman> iShareFreedom: You can't block on irc, but you can ignore
[08:25:48] <Andrew> labrador: He uses icedove, not weechat or anything
[08:25:52] <labrador> lmao
[08:26:22] <Andrew> Why would you use a Thunderbird fork to chat on IRC?
[08:27:32] <labrador> That was the reason I rejected thunderbird as an email client lol
[08:27:34] <tpefreedom> I use hexchat
[08:27:39] <labrador> It just had so much more than just email
[08:27:52] <Andrew> Mutt :)
[08:27:52] <labrador> Like it had a newsgroup reader too wtf
[08:28:06] <tpefreedom> I'm currently looking for a kcma-d8 that supports libreboot

[08:44:42] <Whistler> im wondering if there are 802.11ac wifi cards which do not require blobs... 802.11n is already slow by todays standard
[08:45:17] <DiffieHellman> Whistler: I believe 3 specific models sold by realtek that are in a few usb wireless cards.
[08:45:33] <Whistler> the best I can think of are intel ones but all require blobs.  Broadcom and realtek ones are even worse
[08:45:39] <DiffieHellman> The firmware is in binary form, although under the GPLv2 and the driver is hot garbage
[08:46:03] <labrador> DiffieHellman, wait why is it under the gplv2?
[08:46:12] <labrador> Does realtek release their firmware?
[08:47:37] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Since the driver was for Linux and relies on whatever that generic wireless driver is named
[08:47:50] <DiffieHellman> I don't think anyone has actually asked yet.'
[08:48:07] <labrador> ohh so its forced to be gpl'ed
[08:48:08] <labrador> nice
[08:48:28] <DiffieHellman> Yes, realtek decided not to violate the GPLv2 for that specific family of drivers.

[12:12:08] <DiffieHellman> comrad: FSFE seems to deviate from the FSF's ideals and so the FSF doesn't support them.
[12:12:41] <Whistler> https://www.fsf.org/about/fsf-other
[12:14:06] <Whistler> iirc there was also fsf france which seems inactive for ages.  Not sure what the status is
[12:16:32] <kilobug> Whistler: FSF France doesn't really exist, it's more of an empty shell; we have April which is the most active Free Software-related organization here, and some activity of FSFE, and many other more specific ones

[23:33:55] <kataphusin> I am thinking about collecting a small suite of lightweight free software tools that could be mixed and matched, so not like Blue Button. 
[23:34:52] <kataphusin> Some basic questions I have are: is there a free software alternative to Reveal.js/Beamer and PlantUML (which I use in Emacs) and is there a way for teachers to set up their own IRC channels?
[23:35:52] <kataphusin> I am also interested in collaboration software - and looking into ways to maybe use git to help solve some use-cases.

[23:40:26] <kataphusin> On a totally different note, H-Node is great and helps guide the threat level of changing to free software OS, but there is very little documentation about - sorry to mention it - how to manage non-free blobs that would make up for hardware restrictions.
[23:41:35] <djatropine> what kind of collaboration software? Puredata & GEM? :D
[23:42:27] <kataphusin> djatropine I need to look that up, I hadn't heard of either :)
[23:45:17] <kataphusin> I can't find gem, but I was thinking about - at the very least - a way for people to add comments (marginalia) to texts but if also possible, to create mental maps together (PlantUML is a great example of something easy enough to use: but it is not free software).
[23:45:49] <djatropine> i often use this mind mapping program
