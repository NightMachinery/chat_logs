[10:31:39] <vegai> are there any tools for finding out if a certain library is ... good and living?
[10:32:00] <vegai> I mean, in other language ecosystems this is trivial: go to the github etc. page and if the last commit is more than 6 months away, the library is probably dead
[10:32:12] <vegai> seems like this doesn't quite apply to CL projects, which might just be done
[10:33:30] <vegai> I guess they don't generate quicklisp stats anymore
[10:48:13] *** Quits: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:49:48] <beach> Ask here or in #commonlisp.
[10:49:55] <beach> That's the best way of knowing I think.
[11:15:31] <aeth> ime, a complete library is complete until someone gets bothered enough to write a replacement
[11:17:13] <aeth> and then there are two libraries; see xkcd 927. https://xkcd.com/927/
[12:00:44] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)
[12:13:29] <pjb> vegai: this criteria is idiotic.
[12:14:13] <pjb> vegai: wouldn't you prefer a library that is good and debugged, rather than a library that receives new commit every five minutes and introduces incompatible changes every day?
[12:43:06] <st_iron> why is it better to have commits in the last 6 months? how does it relate to quality and security?

[13:45:24] <pjb> It would be better to look at the issues and how fast they're solved, but even that is not a very good indicator, since it depends on the popularity of the library, not on its usefulness.

[15:33:49] <vegai> pjb: I assure you, it's a valid one outside of common lisp
[15:36:56] <rotateq> what? :)
[15:42:05] <beach> vegai: That's a very sad assessment of non-Lisp software. 
[15:46:30] <st_iron> the lack of updates can be for many reasons like the author is content with the library and does not want to upgrade/break it 
[15:46:57] <st_iron> i've been using 10+ years old perl libraries with no update, they work
[15:47:46] <st_iron> the software world went into a very poor direction with this "deploy to production every 5 minutes" attitude, but it's my personal opinion 
[15:48:03] <st_iron> they bit in their own tail
