[02:32:09] <rawktucc> or anyone for that matter
[02:32:28] <rawktucc> i kinda feel like ... i'd rather not visit an authoritarian country?
[02:32:57] <x10> ...
[02:32:57] <rawktucc> australia just seems really sketchy with a lot of their laws
[02:33:05] <x10> should revisit your list then
[02:33:11] <rawktucc> haha true
[02:33:26] <x10> albania, turkey, malta, macedonia...
[02:34:11] <x10> also you're missing the pearl of europe
[02:34:20] <rawktucc> oh
[02:34:27] <rawktucc> idk australia uhh
[02:34:28] <x10> whole tour of europe & not coming to the centre?
[02:34:29] <rawktucc> hot then? lol
[02:34:33] <rawktucc> x10, what do you recommend :)
[02:34:49] <rawktucc> what is the pearl of europe?
[02:35:02] <x10> belgium, come get fat on our beer, chocolate and waffles
[02:35:20] <rawktucc> ohhhhh
[02:35:31] <rawktucc> yeah I should add that
[02:35:44] <rawktucc> see, I went to the capital, and well I saw that, and I guess I felt maybe belgium wasn't worth visiting
[02:35:50] <x10> yeah hot indeed, got a cousin who emigrated near brisbane
[02:35:52] <rawktucc> sort of like just a quiet government country
[02:35:57] <x10> lol
[02:36:00] <rawktucc> but maybe I'm wrong then about belgium? lmao
[02:36:05] <rawktucc> i loved the comic museum
[02:36:11] <rawktucc> the huge Tintin statue was amazing
[02:36:19] <rawktucc> and belle and boule
[02:36:24] <x10> quiet government? wich of the 6 ones was that?
[02:36:31] <rawktucc> ok I need to check wikivoyage then
[02:36:55] <x10> it's a mess, don't start on belgium politics, you'll need classes ;)
[02:37:08] <rawktucc> the only thing I wanted to do in belgium was buy the exclusive beer made by belgium monks
[02:37:34] <rawktucc> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer
[02:37:41] <x10> yeah got some in the basement
[02:37:42] <rawktucc> but there was a specific one that people like always order in droves
[02:37:53] <x10> westmalle
[02:37:54] <rawktucc> only problem is... if im just a tourist how the heck am I gonna carry that around
[02:38:00] <x10> you're not
[02:38:15] <x10> can't buy it without an appointment
[02:38:19] <rawktucc> yeah exactly
[02:38:24] <rawktucc> and you need an address and car too right?
[02:38:36] <x10> yep
[02:38:47] <rawktucc> maybe i could use the hostel address
[02:38:55] <rawktucc> or there's some family around europe, maybe they'd allow that
[02:39:00] <x10> they have made a deal with a chain of stores last year or so, might be 2 by now
[02:39:16] <rawktucc> yeah trying one would be nice. im more a cider guy
[02:39:16] <x10> cause of corona they wanted less ppl, so you can get it in some stores now
[02:39:44] <x10> don't come here & speak that out loud ;)
[02:39:59] <rawktucc> they dont like cider people?
[02:40:25] <rawktucc> i think we're spoiled in ontario given all the apple orchards we have here
[02:40:30] <rawktucc> abundance of cider varieties
[02:40:37] <x10> hardly see it, considered a kids drink
[02:41:32] <x10> can think of like 2 brands or so

[03:53:02] <rawktucc> the fact they can force a backdoor without any notice into any piece of software made in australia is concerning
[03:53:08] <rawktucc> or quite possibly even abroad, with australians

[20:23:49] <joepie91> which is great if that's your usecase but it's not mine
[20:24:06] <NeoThermic> joepie91, yeah, but if the name is not needed, why bother with it in the link? :D
[20:24:22] <joepie91> I'm building cooperative storage cluster software; that lets you cobble together a production-performant storage cluster out of heterogeneous, variable-latency, variable-storage, low-trust storage nodes operated by potentially many different people
[20:24:30] <unfinity> ・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\_ó<​ QU​ACK!
[20:24:33] <joepie91> ,bef
[20:24:33] <unfinity> joepie91 you befriended a duck in 3.405 seconds! You have made friends with 208 ducks in #datahoarder.
[20:24:48] <joepie91> that is resistant to unexpected node failures, does not disclose the actual data to storage nodes, nor lets them modify it
[20:25:18] <joepie91> NeoThermic: because people complain *constantly* about links being bridged as obscure random keys :)
[20:25:58] <joepie91> anyway yeah my usecase for this project is a freely usable CDN for non-commercial (FOSS) stuff, that people can essentially donate spare storage space to
[20:26:09] <joepie91> another viable usecase would be a backup cluster managed among a group of friends
[20:26:49] <joepie91> running a node requires a Linux system (for now), some unused space on a filesystem, a network connection that's mostly up, and that's it
[20:27:06] <joepie91> it should require nothing else of storage node environments
[20:27:37] <joepie91> think a bit like tahoe-lafs, but actually performant, and with quota and deletion capabilities and a couple of other things that tahoe can't do

[20:30:51] <joepie91> NeoThermic: you have no insight into or access to what is stored; everything is stored encrypted, the decryption key (or well, technically, the decryption key for the *list of* decryption keys) is part of the storage URI that one needs to retrieve the data
[20:31:08] <joepie91> even if you wanted to, you could not access the blobs
[20:31:26] <joepie91> so legally speaking, I'm relying on the zero-knowledge defense here
[20:31:35] <joepie91> you provably could not have knowledge of storing certain data
[20:32:15] <NeoThermic> unsure if, in my mind, that would be morally handy
[20:32:34] *** Joins: TheCoffeMaker (~TheCoffeM@user/thecoffemaker)
[20:32:56] <joepie91> it's up to the cluster operator how to define access control
[20:33:25] <joepie91> in my public CDN case, client access to the storage cluster is associated with an account you sign up for, where you have to specify what it will be used for (which will actually be checked)
[20:34:04] <joepie91> so yes, somebody with an otherwise legitimate usecase could be storing questionable data there in small-enough amounts that it doesn't stand out on the space usage metrics
[20:34:17] <joepie91> but at that point, I'd say it's well beyond "what you can reasonably expect to retain control over"

[20:40:39] <joepie91> NeoThermic: FTR, the main reason for encrypting data actually has nothing to do with liability
[20:41:08] <joepie91> but rather with "some rando's server got hacked" being a very realistic risk when your storage cluster is composed of random donated servers rather than a tightly-controlled network of rack nodes in a single datacenter :)
[20:41:32] <NeoThermic> for sure
[20:41:41] <joepie91> even if all the node operators are nominally trustworthy (which would be a complex constraint for storage space donations), one of them will get pwnt at some point
[20:41:43] <NeoThermic> you also want to avoid poisonous nodes
[20:41:50] <joepie91> and that shouldn't immediately leak a bunch of data
[20:41:57] <joepie91> right
[20:42:12] <joepie91> this system isn't fully trustless, but it does its best to protect from malicious nodes
[20:42:45] <joepie91> anyway all this sort of stuff is why existing storage cluster software is useless to me :p
[20:43:04] <joepie91> and it's a great example of how problematic it is that nearly all software nowadays gets developed in the context of corporate use
[20:43:06] <joepie91> even the "FOSS" stuff
[20:43:20] <joepie91> because this is a usecase that does not exist in corporate environments
[20:43:29] <joepie91> and the result is that nothing implements it

[21:18:45] <d10n> I'd either rsync or pipe via tar and ssh
[21:19:11] <rawktucc> i tested rclone but im gonna just gzip it i think
[21:19:31] <rawktucc> the reads are too slow from the HDD for the tiny files
[21:19:43] <rawktucc> if I use prepacked gzips on an SSD i can theoretically max out my bandwidth
[21:19:54] <d10n> as in tar -cf- /source/dir | ssh machine 'cd /dest/dir; tar -xvf-'
