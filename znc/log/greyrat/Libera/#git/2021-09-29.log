[00:57:40] <yates> rafasc: thanks: http://paste.debian.net/1213638/
[00:58:33] <yates> but now i'm still confused: i thought "HEAD" is simply the tip of whatever branch you're in
[00:58:50] <rafasc> and it is, in a sense.
[00:59:11] <rafasc> the problem here is that you are in no branch.
[00:59:27] <rafasc> you have a commit checked out directly.
[00:59:46] <yates> isn't each and every commit a part of some branch?
[00:59:46] <rafasc> try: git branch -a --contains <commit>
[01:00:00] <rafasc> yates: not necessarily.
[01:00:38] *** Joins: elastic_dog (~elastic_d@2a01:118f:822:9c00:f583:aa51:9ad4:d4fb)
[01:00:50] <rafasc> e.g. you can tag a commit, push it, and delete the branch.
[01:01:17] <rafasc> then you have a commit, that exists, can be checked out, and does not belong to any kind of branch.
[01:01:24] <rafasc> !detached
[01:01:25] <gitinfo> A detached HEAD (aka "no branch") occurs when your HEAD does not point at a branch. New commits will NOT be added to any branch, and can easily be !lost. This can happen if you a) check out a tag, remote tracking branch, or SHA; or b) if you are in a submodule; or you are in the middle of a c) am or d) rebase that is stuck/conflicted. See !reattach

[08:21:31] <davit> Hey guys is there any way to use git to get a dif between two local repos? I see you can use git remote to work with hosted code bases but we have both of ours locally.
[08:22:35] <ikke> you can use that as well
[08:22:45] <ikke> You can add the other local repo as a remote to the first
[08:22:57] <ikke> Just use a path instead of a url
[08:23:58] <davit> Ah cool that makes it easy everything I read mentioned it being a url so figured it wouldn't work locally. I will test that out. Is there any other way that may be more efficient?

[15:37:41] *** Joins: jonosterman (~Rheanna@101.91.240.201)
[15:38:33] <rapha> so with one of our repos we tried some stuff for a few weeks without opening a new branch ... then we decided we'll create a completely new repo for the experimental stuff (since it became something quite different) and on the original repo we want to go back to the last commit before things diverged
[15:38:57] <rapha> is there a way i can do this without resorting to "git push -f", i.e. without f***ing up everyone else's working copies?
[15:39:39] <rapha> (tried from a fresh clone to "git reset --hard <desired SHA>" and "git push origin HEAD:master" but it refuses to do that)
[15:40:25] <rapha> current "git status" is "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 51 commits"
[15:41:02] <osse> if push -f is a dealbreak then you will have to create a new commit that undos the experimental ones, and push that

[18:33:38] <mehwork> i did
[18:33:41] <imMute> if you want to cancel an interactive rebase, delete everything from the file, save, and exit.
[18:33:44] <mehwork> and that's when git status started saying that
[18:34:10] <mehwork> i just closed the file without touching it
[18:34:23] <imMute> that should have let the rebase happen.
[18:34:26] <imMute> did you do 'git rebase -i origin/feature/455'    or something else?
[18:34:32] <mehwork> no
[18:34:53] <imMute> oh, I see you rebased on top of origin/develop
[18:35:25] <imMute> I would probably have to look at your history graph to know what's going on. :/

[18:36:37] <mehwork> the latest git that git log shows is _my_ last commit to this branch, not that it updated it with develop
[18:37:09] <mehwork> and that commit was 10 days ago
[18:37:17] <imMute> mehwork: that's all you'd see.  rebase "replays" your branch's commits on a new base, as if you had made them there in the first place.
[18:37:30] <imMute> so a "updated with develop" commit is *not* expected.
[18:37:39] <mehwork> ok
[18:38:02] <mehwork> i guess i just don't get why 'git status' is acting like things on the remote end are way ahead still
[18:38:56] <imMute> you might need to do a 'git fetch' to make sure your repo's idea of what the remote state is is up to date.
[18:39:43] <mehwork> i did that first before the rebase.  And i just ran 'git fetch' again rn and nothing happened and git status still says the same thing
[18:40:24] <imMute> I assume your branch is "feature/455" ?
[18:40:31] <mehwork> yes
[18:41:03] <imMute> so you rebased on origin/develop, which is a different branch.  origin/develop and origin/feature/455 are two different branches (also separate from your local feature/455 branch)
[18:41:16] <imMute> your feature/455 branch tracks origin/feature/455,  that's what git status is telling you about.
[18:41:38] <imMute> perhaps you meant to do 'git rebase -i origin/feature/455' ?
[18:41:52] <skered> rafasc: Ok.  Looks like bundle did it.  The commit-id is now the same.
[18:41:53] <skered> THannkns
[18:42:06] <imMute> but if you're the only one working in this repo, that's probably not what you want...
[18:42:09] <mehwork> no, i've always does 'git rebase -i origin/develop' instead of 'git merge develop' to update my branch
[18:42:17] <mehwork> that's why i'm confused why it didn't work this time
[18:42:40] <imMute> oh, so you wanted to "pull in" the stuff that's been on develop since your feature branch branched off.
[18:43:13] <imMute> the rebase probably worked, you just need to 'git push -f' to update the origin's feature/455 with your rebased branch.

[18:46:41] <mehwork> ahhh
[18:46:58] <mehwork> yeah i didn't do the git push -f yet because i ran the git status first and was confused by the message
[18:47:07] <imMute> the key there is to remember that only fetch/push/pull interact with the remote.   everything else is 100% local
[18:47:52] <mehwork> ok thanks, yeah that fixed teh 'git status'
[18:49:58] <mehwork> for a second there I thought i had jumped dimensions again, where something i've done worked fine for months and then all of a sudden stops and everyone acts like "that never worked" (which happens to me a couple times a year)

[19:01:10] <mehwork> the merge way of keeping my branch up to date with develop would be: `git co develop && git pull && git co - && git merge develop` right?
[19:02:01] <imMute> you can skip the first 3 and just do 'git fetch && git merge origin/develop'
[19:02:15] <mehwork> oh nice
[19:02:20] <imMute> (assuming you don't actually use your local 'develop' branch)
[19:02:41] <imMute> 'git fetch && git rebase -i origin/develop'  is another option, btw.
[19:03:48] <mehwork> that rebase one is the one i currently do, just to avoid having extra commits every time
[19:04:13] <mehwork> that's the one i was doing before that got me confused when i did a 'git status' before git push -f

[23:13:31] <hajonnes> https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine.git, git fetch, result: Receiving objects: 100% (1094202/1094202), 721.57 MiB, Is this normal? I thought I should not download anything, only check metadata.
[23:14:19] <imMute> hajonnes: it will grab any object (commits, tags, tress, etc) that you don't have
[23:14:23] <imMute> hajonnes: that's entirely expected
[23:14:26] <cousteau> It downloads other commits, but doesn't touch your current commit
[23:16:36] <cousteau> So if you're on branch X, and there have been 1337 commits on that branch in the remote and 1234 on branch Y, git fetch will download those commits and set branches remotes/origin/X and remotes/origin/Y to point to them, so that if you merge your X with origin/X it will be as if you pulled
[23:17:41] <hajonnes> imMute, cousteau, I wanted to download part of a repo. using this guide: https://bytenota.com/git-how-to-clone-a-specific-directory-from-a-git-repository/ So you mean I have downloaded the whole git repo?

[23:17:59] <cousteau> In other words: that downloads all the new commits and saves them to your git history tree, but without touching your current HEAD
[23:19:01] <cousteau> Well yeah, that will only checkout a specific dir, but will download the whole thing

[23:19:20] <cousteau> For saving download data you may want to have a look at shallow clones
[23:19:36] <imMute> hajonnes: I try to avoid downloading "part" of a repo (other than shallow clones) - git wasn't really designed to do that.
[23:19:47] *** Quits: noidea (~noidea@user/noidea) (Quit: Oh wait...)
[23:20:16] <hajonnes> imMute, I know, just needed the one directory and thought I could save bandwith.
[23:20:42] *** Joins: jonosterman (~Rheanna@101.89.207.55)
[23:20:54] <hajonnes> cousteau, I will look in to shallow clones. Thanks for all the great answers :)
[23:20:57] <cousteau> "for saving ON downloaded data", I mean
[23:21:19] <hajonnes> cousteau, yes.
[23:21:57] <hajonnes> imMute. thanks for the help as well.
[23:22:08] <cousteau> It would be nice if you could just use git to fetch a bunch of files, but that's not how it works
[23:22:37] <cousteau> Another option to save bandwidth is to download a snapshot as a zip from GitHub
[23:23:33] <hajonnes> yes. ok. do I do that on the https page or can I use cli for that?
[23:23:52] <cousteau> On GitHub website, click on Code and then Download ZIP
[23:24:03] <hajonnes> ok.
[23:24:14] <cousteau> (that's a feature GitHub offers, not really a git thing)
[23:25:17] <cousteau> Basically you're downloading the whole repo, but only one snapshot of it rather than the whole history with all the versions every file has ever had, so it should be a lot smaller
[23:25:43] *** Quits: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:25:48] <cousteau> You can also download individual files from GitHub.  But not folders, unfortunately.
[23:27:12] <hajonnes> all the things I have downloaded are in the .git folder now? so If I want to save space since I will never use the other stuff I could delete it?

[23:30:30] <hajonnes> cousteau, I like to learn more about git, I have only rudimental knowledge, but usefull stuff i.e. that I can use right away. Do you have a suggestion?
[23:31:17] <cousteau> I learned by trial and error.  But I heard that the Git Book is very good

[23:32:21] <cousteau> And yes, if you want your folder to no longer be a git repository but a plain dir with files, you can just delete .git
