[06:01:43] <rhomb0id> iShareFreedom what about GNU software that depends on open source software for compilation? is this not an advocation?
[06:02:41] <iShareFreedom> you dont know the difference between the opensource and free as in freedom software rhomb0id?
[06:03:10] <rhomb0id> who said that?
[06:03:31] <iShareFreedom> you when are redundant
[06:03:39] <rhomb0id> how am i redundant?
[06:03:55] <rhomb0id> i'm speaking of toolchains
[06:04:05] <iShareFreedom> all free as in freedom software have the source code for the people if they have the program.
[06:04:33] <iShareFreedom> that is a requeriment for have the freedoms essencials of free as in freedom software.
[06:04:34] <kittyblam> iShareFreedom: I am very confused why you are saying these things, I do not see how this was relevant to what rhomb0id was saying?
[06:04:51] <kittyblam> maybe I missed some earlier conversation?
[06:05:13] <iShareFreedom> rhomb0id i recommend you visit: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html
[06:05:15] <rhomb0id> this is typical for libera you say something and someone assumes you are on some other topic

[06:05:57] <bill-auger_> the confusion is that rhomb0id is conflating two separate concerns, one practical, and the other, purely philosophical

[06:06:55] <rhomb0id> i'm projecting a 65% probability
[06:07:28] <bill-auger_> practically, there is no difference between "open source software" and "free software" - there is no reason why a GNU program should not utilize an "open source" library
[06:07:47] <kittyblam> rhomb0id: btw, you seem chill, do you have xmpp or anything setup?
[06:07:52] <rhomb0id> i'm speaking on ice-cat LLVM dependency
[06:08:04] <iShareFreedom> we dont advocate the opensource.

[06:08:33] <kittyblam> iShareFreedom: they heard you the first time.
[06:08:43] <rhomb0id> nah just bored here on IRC, i haven't messed with the cmpp
[06:08:44] <rhomb0id> xmpp
[06:09:31] <bill-auger_> "open source" and "free software" are merely words, which define different philosophcal perspectives, regarding the same objects (freely-licensed software)
[06:09:34] <kittyblam> ah, its pretty neat, could be better but its solid and works well

[06:09:48] <kittyblam> bill-auger_: yeah, 99% of the time they mean the same thing

[06:10:08] <iShareFreedom> and for us that is secundary
[06:10:13] <iShareFreedom> the important thing is have freedom
[06:10:17] <kittyblam> iShareFreedom: that is actually incorrect
[06:10:20] <iShareFreedom> not.
[06:10:30] <iShareFreedom> i recommend you visit gnu.org
[06:10:57] <kittyblam> to be considered "Open Source" it requires other rules that is essentially the same as free software, although it prioritizes the rest less. 99% of the time free software is open source and open source software is free
[06:11:13] <bill-auger_> rhomb0id: utilizing one tool or another does not advocate anything - it is a purely practical technical decision for that project
[06:11:17] <iShareFreedom> when we defend the user freedom
[06:11:21] <iShareFreedom> we speak about free software
[06:11:37] <iShareFreedom> no opensource, becouse opensource defenders only speak about good code.
[06:11:42] <iShareFreedom> and for us that is secundary
[06:11:44] <rhomb0id> so if firefox adopted msvc++ dependency ice-cat would accept it?
[06:12:14] <kittyblam> that is untrue, they are not talking about that entirely, although they do have more of a focus on it and *are* a bit of corporate recuperation.

[06:14:25] <kittyblam> one of the only practical differences that I can think of just has to do with tivoization
[06:14:36] <kittyblam> and subtle stuff like that
[06:15:09] <tpefreedom> kittyblam, open source focuses on practicality
[06:15:23] <tpefreedom> free software puts the emphasis on the freedom aspect

[06:15:35] <kittyblam> well
[06:15:36] <tpefreedom> that's the major difference
[06:16:23] <kittyblam> free software doesn't focus on freedom, they focus on an interpretation of an arbitrary set of four freedoms, but that is philosophically the large difference.

[06:17:57] <kittyblam> sometimes their willing to go outside of the four freedoms to protect the actual ideal of freedom it claims to respresent like when they bothered to deal with a few of the problems with the gplv3, but largely that sadly isn't done more often.
[06:18:06] <kittyblam> iShareFreedom: nobody said that lmao
[06:18:23] <rhomb0id> i don't like being told the only wy to install rust is to pipe in some rust compiler into my terminal 
[06:19:38] <bill-auger_> rhomb0id: at one time, there was a windows version of icecat -  then it became impossible to compile for windows without using some non-free tools (that is what you are suggesting, yes?) - the decision was that there will no longer an icecat for windows

[06:29:24] <rhomb0id> gcc-rust had 6 new contributors this month, hmm ok so hopefully i can shut up about this soon if that project ever picks up a good amount of momentum
[06:29:48] <tpefreedom> rhomb0id, what is bad about rust right now?
[06:29:56] <rhomb0id> the compiler is proprietary
[06:30:02] <rhomb0id> base compiler
[06:30:25] <tpefreedom> BC mozilla trademark policy?
[06:30:40] <rhomb0id> no they literally tel you on the site to pipe their build into your shell
[06:30:47] <rhomb0id> to compile rust
[06:31:02] <bill-auger_> rhomb0id: mozilla is a terrible example - with software that large, the complexity alone, obstructs software freedom more than licensing or philosophy

[06:36:04] <bill-auger_> rhomb0id: you mean rust must be compiled by an existing rust binary? - that is difficult to avoid and is not special to rust - it is likely that software written with a specific version of a specific compiler, will not compile in 5-10 years, with a newer version of the same compiler, or any other - the source code must be adapted occasionally, to be compatible with newer tools - that is part of normal maintenance

[06:36:51] <tpefreedom> bill-auger_,  What are your thoughts on things like projects setting limits for loc?
[06:37:03] <bill-auger_> the reason why rust is more problematic, is that its designers break compatibility much more often, more like 2 months
[06:37:32] <rhomb0id> if it's breaking that much can you really call them "designers"
[06:37:56] <tpefreedom> So C > rust
[06:38:02] <bill-auger_> rather than 5-10 years with C code, mozilla will not compile with a rust that is more than ~2 months old
[06:38:48] <rhomb0id> my issue is that  it requires a proprietary program, or at least a proprietary build    and ice-cat could have forked away the new dependency
[06:39:27] <bill-auger_> tpefreedom: not "greater than" - it is more robust (future-proof)

[06:43:21] <bill-auger_> that is the more insidious another philosophy of "perpetual novelty" - mozilla assumes that no one would ever want to use a web browser or a compiler that are two months old - ie: only the one most recent release of anmy software is - all software older than two month could be deleted from the entire planet, and it would not affect mozilla
[06:44:22] <rhomb0id> yeah security through obscurity. they love it
[06:44:45] <tpefreedom> Turns out mozilla isn't as much of a "good guy" as we thought.
[06:44:50] <tpefreedom> Reminds me of Red Hat.
[06:45:31] <bill-auger_> if you beleive that, then it is inconsequential, that it requires one very specific version of a specific compiler - in that mind-set, there only is one compiler
[06:45:36] <rhomb0id> it's because google pays them a lot of money, and well you can connect the dots there
[06:45:52] <rhomb0id> my current build is years old and every day less sites work in it
[06:46:05] <rhomb0id> because of HOT new google pushed features
[06:46:51] <tpefreedom> Google reminds me off microsoft.
[06:47:16] <M8_--__-3[m]> rhomb0id: what's wrong with more features to track users?

[07:57:51] <bill-auger_> now your are conflating concerns too - privacy issues and software freedom issues are very different - they often conflict
[07:58:00] <kittyblam> if someone wants to use a phone for entertainment I don't see any problem, the only issue is when the so-called entertainment is non-free or corporate propoganda.
[07:58:30] <kittyblam> bill-auger_: they don't really conflict that much, usually you can't trust any privacy without free software
[07:58:56] <kittyblam> I argue they synergize quite nicely
[08:00:14] <bill-auger_> you can not trust the privacy of freesoftware either,  when its only purpose is to communicate with one specific remote server, and it is not possible for you to operate such a server
[08:01:17] <bill-auger_> you have total privacy using that software, if it were not connected to the internet - if privcy is invaded, it is done by the remote server software, not the client
[08:01:22] <kittyblam> free software doesn't imply privacy, but you would be hard pressed to find verifiably private non-free software.
[08:01:57] <bill-auger_> "verifyably" is the key to that - provacy is never verfiable
[08:02:41] <bill-auger_> privacy is nothing but a "i will do not evil" sort of promise, from some server admin

[08:04:17] <bill-auger_> privacy violation does not need to be an attack - it can be done trivially by the server operator - that is the usual csae
[08:04:55] <kittyblam> along with one-time-pads which if done correctly is mathmatically impossible to break (although you would already need secure communications for the keys, and it doesnt say anything about how the message is sent so doesnt say anything about metadata or the such alone)

[08:06:11] <kittyblam> its nice for irc/xmpp styled communications, big server rooms where privacy is hardly a priority
[08:06:29] <bill-auger_> thats sort of verification is not generally useful though - it assumes that all parties intend for privacy - either party to a p2p communication could violate the provacy of the other, easily at any time
[08:06:45] <kittyblam> but for private communications I see no reason why things cant be done properly peer to peer at best or encrypted and through some mixnet garbage at worst
[08:08:30] <rhomb0id> it's not private
[08:08:30] <bill-auger_> agauin that is not the usual case - the usual case is a centralized service - but in both cases, privacy depends on the cooperation of every party to the conversation, including the central server, who most users never know

[08:54:54] <bill-auger_> kittyblam: just to be clear, a video-game playing hammer would be "ok" by me - i was not suggersting that such a thing should not exist - i am suggesting that such a thing does not need to exist, and its ethical concerns derive from the extra unnecessary features, not its hammering functionality (the only reason why anyone wuold actually buy one); so any complaints about its unethical features are not justified - the complaints are as 
[08:54:54] <bill-auger_> frivilous as the features
[08:55:20] <bill-auger_> rather than complaining, that person could look for a comperable device, without the unethical features - but as the unethical features are _also_ the unnecessary ones, it makes more sense to look for a comperable device, without the unnecessary features
[08:56:27] <rhomb0id> s/code/remote web code/
[08:56:27] <bill-auger_> for example, a "dumb" phone vs a "smart" one - not complaining that the smart ones are bad for ya, or trying to fix them
[08:57:24] *** Joins: xiews (~wxie@124.77.91.17)
[08:59:53] <bill-auger_> but to realize that phones do not need to be smart, that is where their ethical problems derrive from - if the software running on my hammer were no-free, i would not try to replace it with a libre replacement - i would look for a good old-fashioned "dumb" hammer, or if none exists, get a smart one and try to de-activate it's "smarts"

[09:05:25] <bill-auger_> if i were a baker, then non-free hammers would be no problem of mine (non-free mobile phones are not a problem for me; becuase i do not own a mobile phone - problem solved) - perhaps kitchen tools are conventionally more sensible/humble (do one job and do it well); and the baking community is generally libre-friendly and sensible about the tools they use

[09:14:24] <rhomb0id> unless you're going to try to crash the moon into earth
[09:14:33] <bill-auger_> absolutly all computing tasks are considered to be part of "the web" now - that underlines it - people are shoe-horning/retro-fitting functionality onto technology which was designed for a very different purpose - one can always expect problem when doing that
[09:14:57] <kittyblam> its pretty trivially ensured right now, unless there is some deep underground doomsday cult I'm not aware of somewhere
[09:15:58] <kittyblam> humanity wouldn't have an assured death if half of humanity was in oneil cylinder and the other half was in an earth without needless centralization or MAD-scale weapons
[09:16:10] <kittyblam> in oneil cylinderS*
[09:16:40] <kittyblam> the second part is probably almost enough on its own and much easier to achieve
[09:18:34] <rhomb0id> they assured it through some simulation?
[09:18:45] <rhomb0id> 100% rating?
[09:19:08] <kittyblam> but I wouldnt be comfortablle without 1. The removal of MAD-class weapons 2. the removal of as many incentives to produce MAD-class weapons as possible, 3. on earth redundancy 4. off earth redundancy (no particular order, and the fourth is kinda useless if the other three aren't a thing)
[09:22:06] <kittyblam> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction rhomb0id I would reccomend reading some of this etc. first, it really greatly depends on the method and scale of attack, but depending on the situation and technique used - absolutely can be guarunteed without proper back-ups.

[19:43:15] <iShareFreedom> Therefore, you can take your software and distribute it freely within your company that has a name, and others could do the same under their own companies with the software they have received freely.
