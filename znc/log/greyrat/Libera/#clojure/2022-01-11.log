[02:58:17] <jeaye> aphyr: Writing your own map to optimize `(:foo bar)` is likely overkill. Type hinting and calling the Java method on the map will be a huge win: https://tech.redplanetlabs.com/2020/09/02/clojure-faster/#dramatic-gains-with-type-hinting

[02:59:49] <aphyr> jeaye: oh, I tried. This is the result of many, many hours with Yourkit. :-)
[03:01:22] <aphyr> (.get m :foo) doesn't really handle this. What's happening here is that Clojure maintains a monomorphic cache at each keyword callsite, and we're allowing that to resolve into code that does a direct field access instead of a linear scan through map keys
[03:02:22] <jeaye> (.valAt ^clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap m :foo) more likely.
[03:03:29] <jeaye> I've optimized ~90% off some functions by using .valAt on maps, .equals to compare, and adding type hints to everything.
[03:03:44] <jeaye> Could be that wasn't enough for you; it's enough in the vast majority of cases, though.
[03:03:52] <aphyr> Agreed, this is the extreme case.
[03:04:00] <aphyr> Here, let me double-check
[03:04:40] <jeaye> Would be interested in the criterium numbers between the type-hinted version and your version.
[03:07:32] <nij-> Hello! (doc nth) returns the docstring for nth (https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/clojure-1.10.1/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L889). How about the "doc map" of nth? (line 894~896)
[03:09:21] <jeaye> That's the metadata map, nij-, not the doc map.
[03:09:29] <ridcully> nij-: (meta #'nth)

[03:11:24] <aphyr> jeaye: Custom map looks roughly 10x faster.
[03:12:19] <aphyr> https://gist.github.com/aphyr/9f9c560e15ca6fc96bb5e467950d3ebe
[03:14:10] <aphyr> And if you think about what the compiler's doing here, it should make sense. The type-hinted valAt call dispatches directly to the valAt implementation of arraymap, sure, but that implementation is still doing a linear scan over the array and comparing keyword equality at each point
[03:16:17] <aphyr> Whereas once the :foo callsite's been invoked, it's got the ILookupThunk cached. It does a single comparison on the class of the map to double-check it's still a wgl.Op, which is pretty cheap, and if it is, jumps into... I think an invokeVirtual on the ILookupThunk, which should also be fairly JIT-friendly. That ILookupThunk#get does a single class identical? comparison and if it passes, immediately jumps 
[03:16:23] <aphyr> to a field access on the object. Waaay friendlier to branch prediction.
[03:16:50] <aphyr> invokeInterface, maybe? Not sure, I haven't been into the compiler's guts in a while
[03:17:09] <aphyr> Either way, it's in practice monomorphic here, and hotspot is *real* good at that

[03:42:27] <jeaye> aphyr: Also, that's not doing a single identical? check; it's doing a linear scan as well, since it's using condp with identical?
[03:42:57] <jeaye> Still faster than a linear equality check though, we can assume.
[03:44:02] <aphyr> jeaye: nope
[03:44:48] <aphyr> The point of the keyword callsites is that you can cache them! After the first use, getLookupThunk doesn't have to be invoked again
[03:45:13] <aphyr> So that condp happens once, on first invocation, as and long as subsequent invocations of the same callsite have the same first arg, they dispatch immediately to the cached ILookupThunk
[03:45:44] <jeaye> I see.
[03:45:51] <jeaye> Very neat.
[03:46:09] <aphyr> It's a little weird, and one of the reasons why (:foo bar) can be faster than (get bar :foo)
[03:46:10] <jeaye> I'm correct that it's limited to hard-coded keywords, though, yes?
[03:46:33] <aphyr> Bingo, yeah. Keyword callsites have special compiler handling.
[03:46:43] <jeaye> Yep, gotcha.

[16:11:57] <nij-> Hi! I'm a bit confused why we need atoms, given that we have dynamic vars: (def ^:dynamic *foo* 1) (println *foo*) (def ^:dynamic *foo* 2) (println *foo*) ;==> 1 2  ??
[16:14:06] <ridcully> those are different usecases
[16:14:35] <ridcully> dynvars are meant to be overridden temporarily (to whatever degree)
[16:15:02] <ridcully> atoms store global state and allow threadsafe internal modification

[16:22:27] <ridcully> defs store things by name in the namespace (changing them is a global lock, afaik).  dynvars allow for temporal change (thread local, afaik).  atoms are a storage that allows concurrent reset!ing and swap!ing their content

[21:22:52] <drakonis> nice.
[21:22:54] <drakonis> no slynk tho?
[21:23:13] <technomancy> I don't know what that is
[21:23:21] <drakonis> its swank but sly :V
[21:23:25] <drakonis> its a fork of swank
[21:23:28] <technomancy> I don't know what that is
[21:23:45] <drakonis> https://github.com/joaotavora/sly its this
[21:23:58] <technomancy> like a kind of slime-ng?
[21:24:08] <drakonis> yeah
[21:24:20] <technomancy> IMO doing this in a language-specific way is a dead-end; that's why swank-clojure is deprecated in favor of nrepl
[21:24:42] <technomancy> oh nice it still assumes your gender same as it did in 2009
[21:24:45] <drakonis> which is why conjure exists, yes?
[21:25:00] <technomancy> conjure is one client for the protocol, yeah
[21:25:06] <drakonis> does it?
[21:25:09] <drakonis> sly that is
[21:25:16] <technomancy> "take this repl, brother"
[21:25:49] <nij-> technomancy:  SERIOUSLY? Why is it deprecated?
[21:25:50] <drakonis> still does.
[21:25:57] <ToxicFrog> Conjure exists to generalize sly to arbitrary genders?

[21:26:20] <nij-> technomancy:  So what's a lang-agnostic way to deal with this?
[21:26:23] <drakonis> its words of encouragement.
[21:26:33] <technomancy> nij-: the nrepl protocol
[21:26:42] <drakonis> conjure is nrepl based iirc
[21:26:44] <technomancy> https://p.hagelb.org/nrepl-words.el.html
[21:27:02] <technomancy> this one assumes your gender too; it calls the user "princess"
[21:27:28] <drakonis> hah
[21:27:49] <ToxicFrog> According to my daughter, what makes someone a princess is not their gender, but the fact that they ride a dragon
[21:27:51] <ToxicFrog> Where's my dragon, nrepl
[21:28:25] <drakonis> https://github.com/Olical/conjure

[21:31:41] <drakonis> slime has finally stabilized

[22:11:05] <andreyorst> do each agent has its own task queue or there's a single queue for all agents?
[22:11:58] <andreyorst> I think I've seen a visualisation of what happens with agents tasks when we send them, but I can't find it
[22:12:27] <technomancy> single queue per agent with a shared thread pool IIRC
[22:12:33] <technomancy> well, two shared thread pools
[22:14:43] <andreyorst> and thread pool runs each agent's queue in separate threads I presume

[23:39:00] <nij-> People who had past experience with other lisps: have you found yourself confused between different lisps and need to spend much time on looking up what's the correct way to do in the currently used lisp? How did you get pass (if ever did) this stage?
[23:39:27] <technomancy> just don't use the hyperpolyglot cheat sheet
[23:39:32] <technomancy> it's really misleading
[23:43:17] <nij-> what is that sheet @@? haven't used it..
