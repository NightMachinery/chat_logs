[00:17:12] <ukba> Dear Crustaceans: some time ago (last few weeks) there was a blog describing how authors created a global authorization/permission system for their company, and how they iterated on it based on feedback from co-workers. I am not able to find this article - any chance some of You remember that post? IIRC they had an old system in place, but it was
[00:17:12] <ukba> passing auth data down the microservices chain and soon the size of "cookie" grew too much, so they ended up creating their own system, a'la Google's Zanzibar. I think the company name started with "S" and was dealing with financial investments of their users.

[22:24:24] <pushcx> Maybe I am trying to split too fine a hair, but I wonder about the value of stories like these, if topicality should differentiate between using computers and making things.
[22:24:34] <manicennui> The first second is about Windows. I find it bizarre to use Windows and then complain.
[22:25:16] <indigo> TIL template template parameters in C++
[22:25:33] <c355e3b> I feel like rant is not nesscarily the best tag to stand all on its own
[22:25:40] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:25:43] <c355e3b> imo rant is like video
[22:25:46] <pushcx> And it feels starker when it's a rant, yeah.

[22:29:15] <Church> Agreed
[22:29:22] <Church> So more tags are needed

[22:30:16] <Church> heh
[22:30:21] <c355e3b> companion_cube: true
[22:30:36] <companion_cube> I, for one, disapprove of all meta-ranting
[22:30:49] <companion_cube> who do these people think, not even using the rant meta-tag
[22:30:54] <Church> Hmm think we might need a meta-discussion on this meta-rant
[22:30:57] <Church> Get to the bottom of it

[23:15:20] <ngoldbaum> i mean there’s a tag for it
[23:15:26] <ngoldbaum> so probably on-topic
[23:15:39] <ngoldbaum> argumentum ad there a tag
[23:15:51] <feoh> I agree. Properly tagged release posts are on topic.
[23:16:10] <wink> pretty sure we had a "not just news" rule
[23:21:37] <feoh> What I could find on this on the actual site is at: https://lobste.rs/about#tagging
[23:21:38] <mockturtle> [ About | Lobsters ] - lobste.rs
[23:22:02] <feoh> Which doesn't seem to my reading to support your claim, but YMMV.
[23:23:54] <pushcx> Poeple are kinda divided about it, I'm curious to see how the meta thread goes.

[23:25:13] <feoh> I have no strong feelings either way. I could see both sides of this particular argument.
[23:32:33] <companion_cube> what's with the Ada fans these days
[23:32:45] <companion_cube> saying Ada is on par with F# as "entreprise language"
[23:33:54] <meff[m]> I think Ada is finally at the point, tooling and culture wise, that it's worth evangelizing to non-gov't-defense agencies
[23:38:19] <companion_cube> possibly; the funny thing is that in that respect it's *younger* than rust
[23:38:33] <companion_cube> and has to catch up to it
[23:39:07] <kline> companion_cube, says more about F# tbh
[23:39:39] <companion_cube> how so? they don't seem comparable to me
[23:40:21] <kline> im suggesting that F# is not an enterprise ready language
[23:40:34] <kline> certainly when i had to use it at uni it was somewhat lacking
[23:40:42] <kline> that was ~8y ago now
[23:44:10] <companion_cube> right, it did change a lot I think

[23:46:13] <varjag> i once interveiwed a guy who had ada on cv
[23:46:16] <varjag> he was like 26
[23:47:12] <varjag> so i like, could you write a procedure declaration in ada
[23:47:32] <varjag> he's oh, i only read a book about it
[23:47:33] <varjag> …
[23:47:38] <varjag> LONG TIME AGO
[23:48:20] <drobilla> Putting languages you can't even write a declaration in on your CV.  Bold move

[23:49:01] <varjag> you guess it, was long time ago

[23:56:14] <drobilla> That wasn't that unreasonable back in the day, I suppose, when C++ basically meant C with classes anyway
[23:56:20] <varjag> i think they made me write a small paint clone in msvc 4.2
[23:56:36] <varjag> never touched msvs before that too
[23:57:37] <gerikson> yeah MSVS can be a beast
[23:58:19] <gerikson> fwiw MS has a consistent look and feel for all their devel stuff
