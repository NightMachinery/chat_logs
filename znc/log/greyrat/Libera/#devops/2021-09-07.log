[19:56:42] <shad> Hi, i'm in charge of a fleet of edge devices and i'm looking for monitoring/observability solutions
[19:58:24] <shad> My devices are running Debian and Docker on the edge, have a 4G antenna that's turned on/off at user's discretion ; whenever the device gets internet connectivity, it starts wireguard and I can access it from my production server. What kind of solutions are there for an observability stack with these conditions ?
[20:00:11] <shad> I'm thinking about running node-exporter and vmagent to push data into a Prometheus running on the production server, but i'm worried about data consumption: would vmagent build up until 4G is turned on, then push a lot of data exploding the data plan whenever it gets turned on ?
[20:00:52] <shad> also, are there specific tools out there for that usage other than prometheus?

[20:48:06] <rawtaz> shad: i would consider unfluxdb with its telegraf agents. its written in Go so you can run it pretty much anywhere and its super simple to set up, and the latest influxdb has a super nice gui for provisioning new telegraf instances (i.e. creating a token for it)
[20:48:46] <rawtaz> i started using grafana cuz it seemed nicer than influx but since influx came out in version 2 where they also created a new "query" language for the graphs its looking really nice. i think im ditching grafana
[20:53:54] <shad>  rawtaz thanks for the input, do Telegraf agents have a setting / mode for intermittent connectivity ? 
[20:54:35] <shad> My clients will be pissed if monitoring over 4G racks up massive bills :D
[20:55:54] <shad> I'm worried about a case where a device hasn't gotten access to internet for > 2months, gets connected, telegraf agent uploads a massive data log over 4G for the 2month without connectivity
[20:56:14] <rawtaz> shad: i havent fiddled that much with it, but what i can tell you is that i have had telegraf agents running that try to deliver data to my influxdb server, and when they cant connect they just complain about it but keep trying.
[20:56:38] <rawtaz> i think it just sends a bunch of JSON so its probably pretty darn slim
[20:57:19] <shad> The fact that it complains and keep trying is fine by me, its expected behavior. The bunch of json is probably slim and should be ok, but I can't take any risks
[20:57:28] <rawtaz> ah, well in the case i examplified above the agent will not send data that it wasnt able to deliver during the disconnect, it will just try to send every time it is supposed to report something. so when the device isnt connected you'd just see a blank in your graphs
[20:57:35] <shad> Roaming data over 4G costs a hefty buck, and I ain't footing that bill
[20:57:59] <rawtaz> well just try it and youll see how it behaves. you can probably configure it a lot
[20:58:10] <rawtaz> i like how versatile telegraf is, it rocks :)
[20:58:34] <rawtaz> just make sure you get the latest version of influxdb, so you can enjoy the fancy provisioning of telegraf in it :)
[20:58:54] <rawtaz> (im saying this because when 2 was new many people seemed to only end up in 1.x docs and be confused etc)
[20:59:12] <shad> is it compatible with Prometheus and Grafana or does it come with its own Graphs application ?
[20:59:44] <shad> We already have some Grafana + VMAgent + VictoriaMetrics in our monitoring, but it monitors our servers, not the edge devices
[20:59:48] <rawtaz> grafana is just a dashboard showing data. you dont send directly to grafana, you'd typically send to e.g. influxdb and grafana would then use that as a data source
[21:00:01] <shad> I'd rather keep everything in the same place
[21:00:14] <shad> Yeah so InfluxDB is a supported data source for Grafana. Thanks for the input !
[21:00:24] <rawtaz> prometheus, not sure, but thats not relevant for telegraf. i imagine you can have influxdb and prometheus connected, no doubt. if nothing else im guessing telegraf can tie it together somehow :)
[21:00:30] <rawtaz> oh yes it is
[21:00:38] <rawtaz> are you already using grafana?
[21:00:57] <shad> Yes, I wrote an ansible role named monitoring that I deploy on production servers
[21:01:08] <rawtaz> i see
[21:01:27] <rawtaz> well then you might wnat to continue using it. it should be fine. you'd miss out on the nice provisioning of telegraf agents in the influxdb gui though
[21:01:34] <shad> It installs a docker-compose that starts VMAgent, Node-Exporter and CAdvisor ; whenever production goes down i'm the first to know it.... usually
[21:01:42] <rawtaz> but theres nothing stopping you from using influxdb for that and grafana for your dashboard
[21:01:57] <rawtaz> the whale would be first, you second :P
[21:02:25] <shad> well, i have added alerts in Grafana for when these servers do not send anylogs for more than a minute i think
[21:03:26] <shad> funny thing, a kernel panic happened somewhere around 4am the day after i set up the whole thing ; i woke up to a slack notif "prod server for <client> is down !" and was like "shit... monitoring is going crazy again"
[21:03:42] <shad> came into work, prod server for <client> was assuredly down lmao
[21:04:37] <rawtaz> nice
[21:04:54] <shad> since that day I trust my monitoring solution :D
[21:06:49] <rawtaz> :)
[21:07:24] <rawtaz> the compose thing you mentioned did you mean it starts that on the nodes you want to monitor?

[21:30:34] <shad> rawtaz: we're on dedicated bare metal for a good chunk of infra, so its servers not nodes as in Kubernetes
[21:31:05] <rawtaz> i mean node as in the general concept - k8s wasnt first to use that term ;)
[21:31:50] <shad> I've templated a docker-compose.yml with things like `services: node_exporter: image:... env: {{ NODE_EXPORTER_ENV }}` and use AWX to run the Ansible job that installs the populated with values docker-compose and then starts it
[21:32:52] <shad> Any time we add a server to the pool, i add it to the `linux-monitoring` inventory with its hostname, and it appears automagically in a Graphana dashboard
[21:34:41] <shad> its a start, but i want to move all that stuff to k8s someday, when i'll know how to manage >250gb storage/client in storage classes
