[15:13:13] <rendar> GNU Awk 5.1.0, API: 3.0 (GNU MPFR 4.1.0, GNU MP 6.2.1)
[15:13:19] <rendar> it seems i have found a solution
[15:13:32] <rendar> grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo|awk -v pct="0.1" '{ printf "%.0f", $2*1024*pct }'
[15:13:55] <emanuele6> in gawk, probably -M also works
[15:14:14] <emanuele6> like   |gawk -M -v pct="100" '{ print $2 * pct }'
[15:14:18] <rendar> i see
[15:14:28] <emanuele6> that will make gawk use bignums
[15:14:31] <rendar> but i have to multiply $2 by 1024 to get bytes
[15:14:39] <rendar> since /proc/meminfo tells me data in kB

[15:15:10] *** Joins: bluedust (~bluedust@117.217.146.23)
[15:15:22] <emanuele6> is that really gawk?
[15:15:38] <emanuele6> i don't think it's gawk
[15:15:50] <emanuele6> i can't reproduce that output in scientific notation in gawk
[15:16:11] <emanuele6> and gawk does not print "not an option: -M" errors, it prints the whole heklp
[15:16:55] <emanuele6> ( also i told you to explicitly use gawk in your pipeline since -M is gawk specific if you see above: <emanuele6 > like   |gawk -M -v pct="100" '{ print $2 * pct }' )
[15:16:56] <rendar> ok maybe it's not gawk, let's fix on the portable version then: printf
[15:17:08] <rendar> i don't want surpises only because a system uses gawk
[15:17:15] <emanuele6> ok, but please don't say it's gawk if it is not gawk....
[15:17:29] <rendar> man this is what i get in my system: GNU Awk 5.1.0, API: 3.0 (GNU MPFR 4.1.0, GNU MP 6.2.1)
[15:17:40] <rendar> that's another system, but i expected the same awk, since it's Debian too
[15:18:04] <emanuele6> debian uses mawk.
[15:18:12] <emanuele6> <emanuele6 > is that mawk?
[15:18:20] <rendar> but in my system i have gawk! and i'm on Debian
[15:18:25] <rendar> anyway
[15:18:27] <mawk> yes
[15:18:30] <rendar> no problem
[15:18:33] <emanuele6> debian has gawk, but awk is mawk
[15:18:41] <rendar> ok
[15:18:52] <rendar> $  awk --version
[15:18:52] <rendar> GNU Awk 5.1.0, API: 3.0 (GNU MPFR 4.1.0, GNU MP 6.2.1)
[15:18:57] <rendar> not here, seemingly
[15:19:09] <rendar> anyway, not a problem
[15:19:12] <rendar> i'm using printf
[15:19:16] <emanuele6> # mawk -M '1' < /dev/null
[15:19:18] <shbot> emanuele6: mawk: not an option: -M
[15:19:18] <rendar> which is more portable than -M
[15:19:31] <emanuele6> gawk does not even have that problem.
[15:19:39] <rendar> ok
[15:19:46] <rendar> now the point is, someone told me that i don't need grep here
[15:19:56] <rendar> awk can grep MemTotal by itself
[15:20:03] <emanuele6> sure
[15:20:31] <emanuele6> run your print command only if you match whatever instead of always running it.
[15:21:28] <emanuele6> awk is   condition { code }
[15:21:28] <rendar> you mean like `awk -v pct="100" '\MemTotal\ { print $2 * pct }'` ?
[15:21:38] <emanuele6> no, that is not valid awk
[15:21:42] <emanuele6> /MemTotal/
[15:22:41] <emanuele6> `/^MemTotal:/' or `$1 == "MemTotal:"' would make more sense, but if but that is equivalent to   grep MemTotal, yes
[15:22:45] <rendar> i see
[15:23:15] <rendar> yes i agree
[15:23:21] <rendar> you mean like `awk -v pct="100" '/^MemTotal:/ { print $2 * pct }'` ?
[15:24:00] <emanuele6> sure
[15:24:18] <rendar> ok, but how can i pass the file to parse to awk? /proc/meminfo ?
[15:24:29] <emanuele6> awk -v pct="100" '/^MemTotal:/ { print $2 * pct }' /proc/meminfo
[15:28:13] <rendar> ok
[15:28:36] <rendar> you forgot printf
[15:29:49] <emanuele6> i didn't forget anything
[15:32:04] <rendar> huh?
[15:32:15] <rendar> with your command, i get 6.55695e+09
[15:32:25] <rendar> but i don't want that notation
[15:32:55] <emanuele6> i copied your command and added /proc/meminfo to the end.
[15:34:06] <rendar> yes, but that was the old version
[15:34:16] <rendar> awk -v pct="10" '/^MemTotal:/ { printf "%.0f", $2*pct }' /proc/meminfo
[15:34:23] <rendar> this is what i need
[15:34:24] <emanuele6> <rendar > you mean like `awk -v pct="100" '/^MemTotal:/ { print $2 * pct }'` ?
[15:34:31] <emanuele6> whatever
[15:35:16] <emanuele6> if you want to print the number in decimal notation use "%.0f\n", sure
[15:35:33] <emanuele6> but the command you sent before that question didn't have it.
