[17:38:33] <Guest80> When he says page cache does he mean something like squid?
[17:39:03] <Guest80> I think the problem relates to a timestamp value always changing on each refresh in the source code

[17:44:51] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com)
[17:45:11] <Guest80> So I am thinking that all gets solved if you change the constantly changing timestamp value to a static value?
[17:46:39] <GinFuyou> Well, I'm not much into the context, but is not it what's written in first post?
[17:46:59] <GinFuyou> make it static and calculate on front or send them in a separate request
[17:47:01] <Guest80> That is how I interpreted it
[17:47:30] <pycode1> Guest80, why not?
[17:48:20] <Guest80> Idk I am not a fan of javascript but that is just me. If you want to use it then go ahead. But I am now even more hesitant with using other libraries especially after that recent nodejs vulnerability with the emojis wiping out your code
[17:48:50] <Guest80> but to my understanding that was a rogue open source developer writing the malware and committing the code

[18:00:23] <GinFuyou> Yes, that what I was doing to output individual html strings
[18:00:40] <Guest80> when you say modify the request, you mean there is no need for etienned's code just modify the current source code of the library?
[18:00:52] <Guest80> ok cool
[18:01:35] <Guest80> I will take a stab at writing the inclusion tag approach that sergei recommends
[18:03:15] <GinFuyou> Guest80, I'm not sure what you talking about, I thought you mean django test, where you should be able to simulate any kind of request, not sure how it correlates with .js
[18:04:31] <Guest80> https://github.com/bmihelac/django-cookie-consent/pull/54#issuecomment-1073150842
[18:04:38] <Guest80> This is what I want to write a test for
[18:04:55] <Guest80> The stripe.js code injects stripe cookies on your 127.0.0.1 localhost
[18:05:18] <Guest80> "Populate third party cookies in the browser"

[18:05:46] <ps_> hi
[18:05:49] <Guest80> I cannot just do response.set_cookie from stripe's domain
[18:06:00] <GinFuyou> test is a python script
[18:06:02] <Guest80> Yea that is what I was thinking
[18:06:13] <Guest80> It does not seem possible to write a test then
[18:06:19] <GinFuyou> why?
[18:06:39] <Guest80> Because there is no browser in the test like you just said
[18:06:49] <GinFuyou> why django test would have anything to do with a client (browser)?
[18:06:51] <ps_> I want to call this method https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.parser.html#email.message_from_file which wants a file object. If a pass a instance of a models.FileField I got an exception. How do you open files?
[18:07:32] <Guest80> Yea so I think selenium is the only way then?

[18:07:59] <Guest80> Otherwise idk how to begin writing a regression test for something like that flow I mentioned
[18:08:48] <Guest80> Basically the middleware will remove third party cookies if you uncheck that cookie group setting or remove the cookie setting from the browsert
[18:09:02] <GinFuyou> I don't understand the problem. Django test should give all the tools to test something which is django part.
[18:09:31] <GinFuyou> If you are testing browser, you are testing something else
[18:10:06] <GinFuyou> simulate changes in browser in the request
[18:10:35] <GinFuyou> it's all just data, no magic
[18:20:28] <Guest80> So would this be enough for the test then? https://dpaste.org/9dAK
[18:22:22] <pycode1> sorry, i am back... yes ok, the true story is that i hate js too i do not like it, but i need to "improve" usability so i should avoid refreshing the pages and these silly things to speed up the ""experience""
[18:22:36] <pycode1> htmx should works for that but i never used it
[18:23:40] <Guest80> Your site will be faster if you do not have to load these third party libraries if you decide to code it yourself.
[18:24:00] <GinFuyou> Well, depends what you mean by improving usability
[18:24:04] <Guest80> Yes experience may look and feel nicer so it depends on your use case
[18:24:47] <GinFuyou> If page reloads fast, it's better than slow-loading part inside of it
[18:25:25] <GinFuyou> and if something to change often, you can async load only that on this concrete page
[18:27:29] <pycode1> uff
[18:27:32] <pycode1> ok
[18:28:13] <pycode1> i really cant see js code xD wo i would like to avoid it at all, maybe htmx is a good compromise
