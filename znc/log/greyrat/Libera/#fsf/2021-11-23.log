[07:22:21] <tpefreedom> How useful would it be to have 100% free software OSes that are not unix-like?
[07:24:43] <White_Flame> depends on what "useful" means to the user?
[07:25:06] <White_Flame> but as a certified unix hater, I would welcome such advancements
[07:25:32] <tpefreedom> I'm fine with unix but aside from GNU itself it's a mess.

[07:26:25] <tpefreedom> On one side you have massive corporations like google and IBM and on the other you have a toxic cesspool of elitists and other unsavory types.

[07:26:49] <tpefreedom> And then you have all the different groups within the broader community who don't like each other.
[07:27:46] <tpefreedom> Also, for the average home or small business user, (outside from self-hosting a small server) many of the features of unix-like OSes are overkill.

[07:28:21] <tpefreedom> For example, most users won't ever care about a large portion of the permissions or the other multi-user aspects.
[07:29:16] <tpefreedom> They just want a machine that will let them do basic productivity work, browse the internet, and maybe play some games or do some work with images or audio or other hobbyist stuff.
[07:29:32] <tpefreedom> White_Flame, what are your issues with unix?
[07:29:40] <White_Flame> doesn't mean that those features aren't useful/necessary behind the scenes of a single-user scenario
[07:30:33] <White_Flame> file system hierarchy, no abstraction besides "block of bytes", no interoperability standards in all the various text config files, too coarse grained permissions models, etc
[07:31:03] <White_Flame> it's a groaning legacy model, where all the complexity is unsolved and pushed up to the user
[07:31:50] <White_Flame> also, C is not a reasonable application development language
[07:32:45] <tpefreedom> I was thinking that a model closer to Amiga OS or classic mac os (but with preemptive multitasking and protected memory) would be a better fit.
[07:32:59] <White_Flame> amiga OS is preemptive multitasking
[07:33:09] <tpefreedom> but not classic mac os
[07:33:24] <White_Flame> however, it's hard to combine memory protection with message passing via simplepointer
[07:33:31] <White_Flame> the mill CPU does allow for such a thing, though
[07:33:50] <tpefreedom> mili?
[07:33:56] <White_Flame> mill
[07:34:01] <tpefreedom> ?
[07:34:08] <tpefreedom> What's that?
[07:34:21] <White_Flame> it's a grassroots complete cpu rethink done by a bunch of very experienced cpu industry people
[07:34:29] <White_Flame> been going on for quite a few years
[07:34:41] <tpefreedom> Also, C is probably just fine for really high performance stuff.
[07:35:07] <White_Flame> not really
[07:35:17] <White_Flame> you can specify C-style performance and memory layouts in many other languages, too
[07:35:37] <White_Flame> without having absolutely everything burdened with that same level of danger & low level hand-holding
[07:36:40] <tpefreedom> What do you think would be a better model for a desktop OS instead of UNIX?
[07:36:52] <White_Flame> anything
[07:37:13] <White_Flame> however, as a lisp guy, the lisp machines are one model of pursuit, although they need better protections
[07:37:23] <White_Flame> to survive in the modern connected era
[07:37:43] <White_Flame> the entire universe of software needs to be refounded
[07:37:57] <White_Flame> it's hard to just look at an OS and say that that's the fixing change that will be needed
[07:38:33] <tpefreedom> But an OS is a good place to start with.
[07:38:48] <White_Flame> ever since people saw that lots of money can be made in computing, all development of standards & advancing the empowerment of the user stopped
[07:39:12] <White_Flame> sure, but it wouldn't be able to play well with the rest of the world
[07:39:18] <White_Flame> hence a reboot of the software universe
[07:39:46] <tpefreedom> One of my major motivations is also in creating unbloated stuff for old systems that doesn't depend on suckless (or other parts of that section of the communty).
[07:40:10] <White_Flame> well, "bloat" is usually a red herring
[07:40:23] <Rynn> Yeah, the complete inundation of commerce into the computing space is why I've found myself regressing when it comes to software and protocols. Been setting up my desktop to run Void. Back on IRC instead of Discord. Been finding myself zooming around gopherspace and gemini capsules and avoiding the standard web bloat.

[18:37:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> i messed with me keybinds and it confused me mkay u.u
[18:37:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> now u go on guix

[18:38:17] <Rynn> Vim was the first one I tried during my first forrays into Linux, which seems to have created a mental block when it comes to using Emacs.
[18:38:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> netRunner57: use guix-install.sh to get guix on your current system in the meanwhile then
[18:39:07] <netRunner57> M6piz7wk[m] : thanks for that, it seems better than to read the entire guile manual and guix manual lol
[18:39:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> Rynn: i hate emacs's keybinds  just use emacs-evil and have a great time
[18:39:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> netRunner57: u no read you do full kreyren on that instead and then cry in #guix 
[18:39:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> much more efficient
[18:40:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> Rynn: your system doesn't smell like guix.. why u no on guix

[18:42:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> and no considering just mindless doing what krey says
[18:42:39] <M6piz7wk[m]> migrate on guix 
[18:42:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> unless u r on guix already
[18:42:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> in which case u good
[18:42:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> 🔪
[18:43:03] <nomagno> I don't know if this is trolling or sarcasm.
[18:43:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> working strategy got 5 people today to migrade so far
[18:43:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> BE THE 6TH 🔪
[18:43:41] <nomagno> Definitely trolling
[18:43:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> i never troll
[18:43:57] <Rynn> It's not a bad strat, it did prompt me to check out the Guix homepage since I haven't looked at the distro in ages.
[18:44:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> unless it's a game
[18:44:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> this ain't no game
[18:44:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> u do guix it's life
[18:44:14] <nomagno> Well please use more considerate language in the future
[18:44:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> nomagno: oh dare i ask you my good man to please consider guix for the glory of free software and all the GNUs?
[18:45:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> did it work
[18:45:23] <nomagno> Well I am happy with Debian, but thank you for the offer kind sir!
[18:45:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> none's happy with debian you life in a lie
[18:45:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> *live
[18:45:43] <Rynn> For maximum effectiveness, you need to tip your fedora as you say it.
[18:46:16] <nomagno> Debian fully enforces a free/nonfree separation. That's all I need honestly
[18:46:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> Rynn: fedora doesn't follow FSF's distribution guidelines, GNU Guix proudly follows them and is endorsed by FSF
[18:46:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> boo fedora
[18:47:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> nomagno: it ain't as the non-free is still officially supported~
[18:47:38] <nomagno> The FSF's distribution guidelines don't actually determine how free an operating system is, just how much it opinionated itself
[18:47:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> debian's like toy in comparison to guix heh
[18:48:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> nomagno: how dare you question the visdom of GNU!
[18:48:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> also why else would be trisquel a thing if it did follow those
[18:48:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> so do guix.. it's like gentoo, but more archy and functional 
[18:48:50] <nomagno> I don't think pretending nonfree software doesn't exist is a good strategy. It ironically goes against freedom of choice
[18:49:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> and doesn't cause you a headache like the weird JSON thing that nixos came up with
[18:49:31] <nomagno> You need to be free to choose to not be free, to be really free
[18:49:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> nomagno: aaaa stop using my arguments against me and do guix
[18:49:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> else fasist
[18:49:49] <netRunner57> But you can use non free, it is just not encouraged
[18:50:11] <netRunner57> I think it is fine, and I say that as a person who depends on nonfree drivers
[18:50:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> ye guix has unofficial channel for non-free 
[18:50:25] <M6piz7wk[m]> still not part of distro

[20:15:35] <nomagno> Debian clearly separates out free and nonfree software, and only ships with the free software repo enabled. You can find it listed in their page
[20:16:26] <nomagno> The FSF chooses to subject operating system distributions to ideological checks apart from license checks.
[20:17:13] <nomagno> This is fine, but please don't actually refer to all non-qualifying distributions as nonfree, because there isn't actually a 'Free distribution definition', just a 'FSF-friendly checklist'

[21:25:02] <White_Flame> yep, and the browser itself isn't really the biggest problem.  A subset of HTML/JS would be okay.  But it's mostly the advertising spycraft that causes all the problems, and "engagement" metrics which isn't about tech at all

[23:41:50] <yrk> andrzejku: your next programming project may right in front of you, but you've never thought of it as a project

[23:43:24] <GNUmer> Evening! The Finnish Matriculation Examination Board has invited me to talk about why "they haven't released the source code for their modified Linux kernel" next Wednesday. If I don't get the source released or offered on request after next Wednesday, I'll be reporting the FMEB to Software Freedom Conservancy.
[23:43:25] <andrzejku> no magic
[23:44:33] <belgin> good luck, GNUmer 
[23:46:41] <andrzejku> GNUmer, good luck!
