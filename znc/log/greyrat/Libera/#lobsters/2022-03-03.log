[00:21:08] <ngoldbaum> they’re still selling low-end touchbar mbps
[00:21:32] <ngoldbaum> i’ll be pretty interested to see whatever goes into the $1500 mbp product slot

[00:38:58] <iDrougge> ngoldbaum: I don't notice the touch bar since it has a real escape key.
[00:39:21] <bkero> When the best thing you can say about a thing is "At least I don't notice the deficiencies"
[00:39:31] <ngoldbaum> it’s just a dumb and useless oled screen
[00:39:59] <iDrougge> It tells you how little you use the F keys.
[00:40:05] <ngoldbaum> why do i want to pay for a dumb oled screen?
[00:40:09] <ngoldbaum> also intel bad
[00:40:13] <ngoldbaum> fans bad
[00:40:16] <iDrougge> Intel?
[00:40:28] <iDrougge> I was thinking of he original M1 MBP.
[00:40:30] <ngoldbaum> the current mbps have intel chips still don’t they?
[00:40:39] <ngoldbaum> oh no i’m misremembering nm
[00:40:47] <iDrougge> I think they are kept for people who actually need Intel.
[00:40:50] <ngoldbaum> also maybe like a port or two wouldn’t hurt?
[00:40:57] <technomancy> one of my new coworkers got sent an arm one and had to send it back for an intel since a bunch of our internal stuff somehow hasn't been ported over
[00:41:00] <iDrougge> Certainly wouldn't hurt.
[00:41:19] <iDrougge> technomancy: That's awful on two counts.
[00:41:42] <ngoldbaum> i have an xps 13 that’s about to go eol on the ubuntu 18.04 running on it
[00:41:46] <technomancy> yeah he couldn't get any work at all done  for like a week and a half

[05:38:37] <hschmale> From wikipedia:
[05:38:39] <hschmale> >The adjective endian has its origin in the writings of 18th century Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift. In the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels, he portrays the conflict between sects of Lilliputians divided into those breaking the shell of a boiled egg from the big end or from the little end. He called them the Big-Endians and the Little-Endians.[10][11] Cohen makes the connection to Gulliver's
[05:38:41] <hschmale> Travels explicit in the appendix to his 1980 note.
[05:39:32] <hschmale> I would argue the only way to break a hard boiled eggs is from the wide bar cause that gives you space to get around the rest of the egg.

[19:17:06] <JordiGH> How the heck are you supposed to hit the option key on a mac?
[19:17:14] <JordiGH> With the palm of your hand?
[19:17:24] <JordiGH> My left index finger is on the f.
[19:17:54] <JordiGH> I can sort of twist my wrist around about tau/6 radians to hit option with my thumb.
[19:18:02] <JordiGH> Or I can move the whole hand away from homerow.
[19:18:06] <JordiGH> How do you guys do this?
[19:18:32] <ben> where is that on a non-mac kb?
[19:18:37] <kline> ben, winkey
[19:18:40] <JordiGH> There's no such key on a non-mac keyboard.
[19:18:54] <ben> i usually hit winkey with my pinky
[19:19:05] <kline> JordiGH, i translate my hand left until my thumb is over it and then slide it back until i feel the homebump under my index
[19:19:15] <JordiGH> So you move your whole wrist??
[19:19:17] <ben> left-alt is thumb since i don't use that for spacebar
[19:19:23] <kline> its not a big move and not a key i need often
[19:19:43] <JordiGH> Apparently it's the only key I can map to meta for readline.
[19:19:53] <JordiGH> This is so horrible, ack, I hate macs so much.
[19:19:53] <kline> JordiGH, no, i rotate around my upper arm
[19:20:10] <kline> like, think about the upper arm as a vertical axis, rotate around that
[19:23:44] <gwozniak> I use my thumb to hit
[19:23:46] <gwozniak> hit it
[19:24:06] <JordiGH> Can you take a picture of what your hands look like when you hit option?
[19:25:02] <gwozniak> I suppose, but I just slide it over a little more than I would if I were hitting the Command key
[19:25:19] <gwozniak> Sometimes I'll move my hand to hit it
[19:25:55] <gwozniak> I do the same thing on Windows/Linux machines with standard keyboards and haven't found it to be much different

[19:32:44] <JordiGH> I have to twist my whole hand around.
[19:32:45] <kline> JordiGH, you dont have to glue youre finger to the F key, it has a bump for a reason
[19:33:04] <kline> translation is better for your wrist than twisting
[19:33:14] <JordiGH> Yeah, it has a bump so you know where to put your hands at first and never moving them again.
[19:33:16] <JordiGH> That's how I use Emacs.

[19:33:29] <kline> ok, thats an opinion, but its not good typing habit
[19:33:37] <JordiGH> It's a great typing habit I've used for 20 years.
[19:33:41] <JordiGH> Fingers never leave homerow.
[19:34:20] <kline> if you're willing to die (or at least kill your wrist) on the hill of bad ergonomics in order to never break an arbitrary rule for optimising typing speed, thats your call
[19:35:21] <JordiGH> Bad ergonomics my ass, my hands are great and my Emacs usage is great.
[19:35:31] <gwozniak> My fingers move off of home row all the time
[19:35:37] <JordiGH> How can you live like this
[19:35:42] <kline> bad ergonomics is the choice to twist your wrist when you cant easily reach a key
[19:35:43] <JordiGH> It's undignified.
[19:35:47] <kline> good ergonomics is moving your hand if needed
[19:36:09] <JordiGH> So you move your whole hand all over the keyboard all the time to hit modifier keys?
[19:36:10] <chenghiz_> i thought you were gonna SSH in from a linux box
[19:36:17] <gwozniak> I gave up on keyboard purity when I realized it's a fool's game
[19:36:19] <JordiGH> chenghiz_: I'm trying not to.
[19:36:26] <kline> JordiGH, yes, basically. if i need to, i will
[19:36:37] <kline> thankfully you dont generally need the windows/option key when typing
[19:36:43] <kline> so its not hugely disruptive
[19:36:46] <leon> this is why I got a split keyboard with extra thumb keys
[19:36:58] <kline> alt and ctrl are more easily reachable so i dont need to move my hand for them
[19:37:02] <leon> my thumb hurt too often from hard to reach keys
[19:37:40] <kline> leon, yeah, if i went back to using a computer for my job full time i would probably get a better keyboard like that
[19:38:13] <kline> i like the ones that have a slight "outward/downward" tilt to them and little 4-button thumb clusters on the inward side of the split space bar
[19:38:19] <kline> i suspect we're thinking about very similar keyboard
[19:40:06] <leon> I think so too
[19:40:11] <kline> id probably get something like this, but make it myself: https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/unparalleled-extensibility-anim-opening2.jpg
[19:40:11] <leon> like this? https://i.redd.it/xlsp81fwacs11.jpg
[19:40:16] <kline> yeah
[19:40:18] <leon> that's the one I have
[19:40:45] <leon> that looks quite cool too, the angle already helps a lot
[19:41:05] <kline> we use trackballs at work

[19:41:15] <JordiGH> mac users can't put up with mac modifier keys.
[19:41:15] <hexa-> mx ergo <3

[19:43:51] <ngoldbaum> you can remap the capslock key on a mac if you want
[19:43:57] <ngoldbaum> you do need to accept the eula though

[19:48:20] <kline> i know moving to a mac is very traumatic for you but you have to adapt
[19:48:42] <JordiGH> No, I don't have to.

[19:50:47] <kline> thats definitely an overreaction
[19:51:14] <kline> i know this is an overreaction because i use multiple keyboards, including some incredibly shit ones, and everyone i know who uses them has minor grumbles but gets by just fine
[19:51:22] <JordiGH> You've typed with your hands for 30 years. 20 years without moving your wrists.

[23:18:27] <c355E3B> There really isnt a good way to explain to folks the connections and sequencing between things
[23:18:32] <c355E3B> I'm kinda tempted to shift it to graphql
[23:18:34] <iDrougge> Only artisanal API clients here.
[23:19:12] <_rubik> iDrougge: hand crafted with love and a flannel shirt -- the way all good api clients should be
[23:20:02] <_rubik> c355E3B: You raise a good point. Is that because of openapi, or a side effect though?
[23:20:47] <c355E3B> IMO because of the spec

[23:53:12] <gwozniak> Docker/system question: we're getting this error from Docker when running our test suite: 'exec setns process for init caused \"exit status 23\""'. It's ENFILE (too many open files).  Any suggestions on what I should look at to debug it?

[23:55:51] <gwozniak> which key tells you the number of open files?
[23:56:19] <rwb> uh, serverfault says something like fs.nr_open or fs.file-max
[23:56:22] <rwb> but i'm not sure which one
[23:56:47] <rwb> might have some more info: https://sysctl-explorer.net/fs/nr_open/
[23:56:47] <mockturtle> [ nr_open | sysctl-explorer.net ] - sysctl-explorer.net
[23:57:39] <rwb> also check your ulimits?
[23:57:43] <gwozniak> Note: getting this information from the running process is probably going to be difficult.  Anything useful post-mortem is better (what to look for in logs, etc.)
[23:58:11] <rwb> there's also this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29403185/docker-error-too-many-open-files#43265189
[23:58:11] <mockturtle> [ Docker error: too many open files ] - stackoverflow.com
[23:58:12] <gwozniak> Also note: this always happens exactly once in a test run, for a seemingly random test
[23:58:23] <rwb> what does the test do?
[23:58:34] <rwb> or is it a different test everytime?
[23:58:43] <gwozniak> Different one every time, so far
[23:58:50] <rwb> ah, that's annoying
[23:58:56] <gwozniak> Takes about 40 minutes to run the tests
