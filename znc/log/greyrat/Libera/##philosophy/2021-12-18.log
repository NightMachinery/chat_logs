[15:18:15] <arryana> i'd wrapped lindor truffles in a bit of marzipan
[15:18:17] <arryana> oooh
[15:18:37] <Lumine> All I have is Tuc crackers
[15:18:50] <pussipupu> I got frustrated looking for candle equipment so I'm printing a hair cutting comb and bought some weights
[15:19:04] <pussipupu> Tuc are excellent
[15:19:13] <arryana> i can't look at crackers since the 'cream cracker episode' (tm)
[15:19:47] <Lumine> I just woke up from a nap
[15:20:34] <Lumine> Was a long night
[15:21:12] <arryana> my other half had been using various chemicals on a guitar body, and inhaled too much of them.  this made his head swim and his hands tingle, and he freaked out thinking he was having a stroke
[15:21:25] <arryana> which then caused him to hyperventilate on top of it
[15:22:18] <arryana> he called an ambulance, and when they came to assess him, they asked him what we'd been talking about before the episode happened, to see if he was coherent.  he replied, 'cream crackers', and they asked 'were you talking about cream crackers because you were ... confused?'

[15:29:41] <pussipupu> So much so I generally don't keep them in the house because I don't trust myself

[15:30:13] <arryana> somehow i was born one of those freaks of nature who eats four crackers.  or ten potato chips.  then i just don't want any more.
[15:30:14] <Lumine> Was about to say right about the same
[15:30:39] <Lumine> If I have a bag, it's going to be an empty bag soon
[15:32:13] <arryana> i keep them around for the porphyria thing, and eat two every four hours or so
[15:35:42] <arryana> but i suppose any reason to eat cream crackers is a good reason

[19:29:29] <arryana> mine's coming in the next shop, christmas and all.
[19:29:37] <arryana> or at least, parts for it.
[19:29:51] <arryana> mmmm, grapes.
[19:54:17] *** Quits: tercaL (~tercaL@user/tercal) (Quit: halt -p)
[19:55:18] <blkshp> Some nice brie, some shropshire blue and some morbier with some hovis biscuits, water biscuits, mini cheddar. some italian cooked meats, some red onion chutney, strawberry jam, grapes yes, strawberry pieces
[19:56:38] <blkshp> Ad yes don't judge me for strawberry jam unless you try it
[19:56:50] <arryana> sounds brilliant
[19:56:53] <arryana> i can't do the chutney
[19:57:03] <blkshp> no, you can have yours without.
[19:57:07] <blkshp> :D
[19:57:09] * arryana smiles
[19:57:30] <arryana> i think we've got cheddar, brie, boursin, and a 'cheese sampler' coming
[19:57:51] <arryana> there's a very good stilton in the fridge
[19:57:59] <pussipupu> Send me proper strong cheddar ):
[19:58:00] <blkshp> ooh, boursin, i do like boursin
[19:58:21] <arryana> i don't blame you for missing it, cheddar here is great
[19:58:32] <arryana> and strong is the only sort we get
[19:58:48] * arryana prefers opinionated cheeses
[19:59:49] * arryana is sticking christmas decorations around the zen room
[20:00:52] <pussipupu> We get boursin and similar
[20:01:15] <pussipupu> No Cheshire though :'(
[20:02:30] <arryana> that's tragic.
[20:12:14] <blkshp> ooh, forget all of it... someone put a camembert in the oven, cut up carrots, celery and toast some nruschetta with garlic butter.
[20:12:22] <blkshp> s/nr/br
[20:12:22] <ro-bot-o> blkshp meant to say: ooh, forget all of it... someone put a camembert in the oven, cut up carrots, celery and toast some bruschetta with garlic butter.
[20:19:24] <arryana> i generally cut a camembert-sized hole in the middle of a good crusty bread, put the camembert in it, grind a bit of fresh black pepper on top, and then sprinkle it with slivered almonds before sticking it in the oven
[20:20:22] <blkshp> ooh, i have done that but never with the almonds.
[20:20:41] <blkshp> Bit of white wine perhaps
[20:21:48] <pussipupu> You can bake the camembert into a new loaf too
[20:21:54] <pussipupu> though I find that trickier
[20:22:14] <blkshp> THAT i have never considered
[20:24:47] <arryana> you're braver than i am
[20:31:07] <mnemon> pussipupu: have you already eaten your way throgh all the fancy cheeses that are available locally? :D
[20:32:51] <mnemon> although can appreciate missing a good one, was annoyed that I couldn't find a good substitute for the .fi "good regular cheese" in switzerland despite the availability of a lot of fancy stuff :/
[20:32:55] * arryana still wants to try reindeer cheese
[20:33:35] <mnemon> kinda of a rarity, I don't think I've ever tried such a thing and I have family who own reinderrs
[20:33:44] <mnemon> *reindeers
[20:34:32] <mnemon> .fi has tons of plain ol' cow milk cheese on offer though

[21:48:41] <blkshp> It's not that sweet.
[21:48:47] <arryana> stuff like fanta, red bull, or other such things i've never even tried
[21:48:48] <blkshp> I can't drink the one with sugar in

[21:49:09] <blkshp> I usually buy perrier carbonated and Ginger beer.

[21:49:56] <arryana> on a very rare occasion at home i will add elderflower cordial or blackcurrent cordial to sparkling water, but it's so dilute that my other half can barely taste it
[21:51:36] <blkshp> I have elderflower, grenadine, and passionfruit in th cordial dept.
