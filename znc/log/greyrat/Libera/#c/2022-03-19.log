[02:51:19] <Hexmind> Keep in mind that if you use Makefile to check for dependencies you may run into weird problems. Say your "common.h" file includes "header1.h" and you make a change to "header1.h" and your source file now needs that new declaration in "header1.h" but since makefile doesn't see that dependency it will not recompile your source code that depend on it.

[05:33:21] <nitrix> cuppajoe, Two objects are involved, the pointer and what it points at. Since functions passes their arguments by copy, it's the pointer that gets copied, not what it is pointing at.

[05:37:22] <nitrix> cuppajoe, Essentially, the only time you'll need a pointer to another pointer is when your goal is to mutate that other pointer from inside a function.

[05:39:47] <caze> cuppajoe: C is pass by value. That means that when you pass something to a function, a copy of that thing is made, and the copy is what the function receives. Any modifications that the function makes is to the copy, and doesn't affect the original. So when you pass a pointer to a function, a copy of that pointer is made. But both pointers point to the same data.
[05:40:22] <cuppajoe> Yep, thanks for the clarification
[05:40:25] <caze> cuppajoe: If you want the function to change *where* the pointer points, then that change is done to the copy, not to the original.

[06:20:44] <caze> yetoo: The printf is misleading. "x is 27" should be "*x is 27"
[06:21:45] <yetoo> this is probably c++, looking at the directory this came from it looks like c++
[06:21:55] <caze> yetoo: And as that should make clear, you're not changing x, therefore &x is not necessary.

[09:24:11] <pony> :D
[09:24:22] <pony> 🐛
[09:24:34] <greeter> i'm writing a text adventure and now the player has the god like power of teleporting any objects in the game to their inventory
[09:24:45] <pony> nice
[09:24:49] <pony> a rougelike?
[09:24:50] <pony> a mud?
[09:24:54] <greeter> indeed, but not quite what i'm looking for
[09:25:03] <greeter> just one of those old text adventure games, like what infocom used to release
[09:25:15] <pony> nice
[09:25:16] <pony> those are fun
[09:25:38] <greeter> more fun to code than play i think lol
[09:25:45] <pony> yeah :P
[09:26:10] <greeter> learned way more about structures and pointers than i knew there was to learn :-P
[09:27:00] <pony> nice
[09:27:39] <greeter> tomorrow's goal will be to try to figure out how to ensure the player can only take objects from their current location. i thought i was already doing that, but my logic of that function seems to be faulty at best :-\

[10:40:18] <PaulePanter> Do you know of a more elegant way to write: return (func(smth) == a || func(smth) == b || func(smth) == c || func(smth) == d)? The compiler is probably going to optimize it, but also for the reader it’d be great to know, that the same function is actually called. I guess temporary variable?
[10:40:43] <PaulePanter> I am asking because of +static inline uint8_t is_in_authenticated_states(struct mod_hdcp *hdcp) in https://lists.x.org/archives/amd-gfx/2022-March/076867.html.

[17:10:44] <pert> for a reason I won't unravel, I'm casting the pointer of a function with type void (*)(int, int) to a pointer of type void (*)(int, ...) and invoking it using that mangled function pointer, but still passing the correct number of arguments (two ints). this is probably UB, but based on implementation details, how likely is this to break?

[17:12:18] <dave0> it's a different calling convention, i would guess it breaks badly
[17:12:34] <dave0> does it have to be varargs?
[17:14:28] <dave0> if you have an upper bound on the number of arguments, just make your function take that many ints, and pad the rest of the args with 0
[17:15:00] <pert> I guess I should elaborate on what I'm doing. I'm dealing with a library (GPGME) where a function is documented as having one parameter, but in practice actually take two. I'm trying to use _Generic in such a way so that my code can cope with either prototype.

[17:19:41] <fizzie> That's the one that at least current C23 drafts still keep.
[17:19:42] <pert> dave0: that might change. I think the prototype fizzie suggested is the right way to go, thanks
[17:20:31] <dave0> fizzie: ohhh so it's only this?    int func(a, b) int a; char *b; { ... }
[17:21:26] <fizzie> Yes, that's going away completely. And `int func() { ... }` definition is made equivalent to an `int func(void) { ... }` one, i.e., it provides a prototype. But `int func();` style declarations are still there.
[17:22:19] <dave0> fizzie: awesome
[17:22:28] <rahl> rustytaco: fair point. It's just that I have several people who are on a vps to be able to pull the repo, but not push - but a couple of them from their own local machines can push so their personal accounts are handled separately
[17:22:40] <rahl> (maybe I'm overcomplicating; wouldn't be the first time)
[17:23:38] <dave0> fizzie: it's a bit of a shame.. the    int func(a, b) int a; char *b; { }    syntax is cute

[22:26:47] <joomla9> :Xgc
[22:26:49] <joomla9> thanks
[22:26:55] <Xgc> joomla9: S is just the struct tag.
[22:27:19] <nitrix> You cannot use `S` for your variable definition. There isn't an `S` type. `S` is the tag part of the `struct S` type.
[22:27:44] <Xgc> joomla9: Much like you can't initialize int, only an object (instance of int).

[22:34:00] <nitrix> I think I'm understanding the question now. Values can be passed around and they have a type. If you create objects to store values of a given type, you can initialize the object with something more sensible for your program.
[22:34:20] <nitrix> You cannot "pass around" or "initialize" a type, that's not what a type is/does.

[22:40:15] <cassepipe> Hi ! I have a question (again) : When I fork a program, its whole memory is copied. So far so good. Now when I try to free memory in the child process that was allocated in the parent, -fsanitize=address complains that I am attempting to free memory that was not previously allocated.
[22:40:50] <joomla9> Xgc: To clarify this doesn't apply to enums, i.e. in `enum S {a,b,c};` a, b and c can be used without an instance of S, they are just integers.
[22:40:57] <joomla9> correct?
[22:41:39] <cassepipe> cassepipe: So I should avoid freeing memory in the child that was allocated in the parent ?
[22:41:56] <nitrix> joomla9, The type is still `enum S`. `a`, `b` and `c` are created as enumeration constants and can be used wherever a value with an integer type is allowed.
[22:41:59] <twkm> then either the detector is flawed or the pointer is wild.
[22:41:59] <Xgc> joomla9: Those are just constants / values, not objects.
[22:42:49] <joomla9> right, so `a` is similar to doing `const int a = 0;`
[22:43:04] <twkm> cassepipe: then either the detector is flawed or the pointer is wild.
[22:43:12] <cassepipe> twkm: So you say I should be able to do it ?
[22:43:17] <nitrix> joomla9, No, because that would be an object. It's similar to `0`.
[22:43:50] *** Joins: oxfuxxx (~oxfuxxx@193.9.112.238)
[22:43:59] <twkm> yes you should cassepipe.
[22:44:18] <joomla9> i see
[22:44:18] <nitrix> joomla9, Your confusion seems to be with objects, types and values. Objects stores values. Values have types.
[22:44:18] <cassepipe> twkm: Thanks. Will look further into it then.

[22:46:43] <nitrix> joomla9, Consider `char x = 42;`, the value `42` (of type `int`) is assigned to the object `x` (of type `char`).
[22:47:20] <nitrix> joomla9, That's done through initialization, so the object is created with that value.
[22:47:56] <joomla9> so in `enum S {a,b,c};`, `S` is  a tag, a,b,c are constants. if I do `enum S my_s;` then my_s is an object of type S ?
[22:48:11] <nitrix> joomla9, I could have done it differently. `char x; x = 42;` now `x` is created with an indeterminate value, then later on `42` is assigned to it.

[23:50:50] <PaulePanter> Do you know of a more elegant way to write: return (func(smth) == a || func(smth) == b || func(smth) == c || func(smth) == d)? The compiler is probably going to optimize it, but also for the reader it’d be great to know, that the same function is actually called. I guess temporary variable?
