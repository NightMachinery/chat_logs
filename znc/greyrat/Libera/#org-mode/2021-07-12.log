[02:05:31] <Codaraxis> Is there any system that provides levels of priorities? I not infrequently will end up with a set of tasks that are all high priority in that they should be prioritized over all the normal tasks.
[02:05:42] <Codaraxis> However, internal to the set, they have their own priority structure and should be done in a certain order.
[02:06:17] <Codaraxis> Unfortunately, the tasks, besides being high priority, are often independent of one another, so it doesn't make sense to set up a typical dependency chain.

[02:13:33] <Codaraxis> My current solution is to combine it with tags. So, for example, I act on the knowledge that tasks tagged urgent supersede the normal priorities and then look at the priorities for those tasks

[05:12:11] <shrysr> Codaraxis: maybe try https://orgmode.org/manual/Priorities.html
[05:14:04] <Codaraxis> shrysr, I'm using priorities. What I'd ideally like are nested levels of priorities. So, for example, priorities 1 - 10, each of which further has priorities 1 - 10.
[05:15:37] <Codaraxis> So, for example, I've worked my way through all the priority 1 tasks, I'd now to pull up all the priority 2 tasks and have them sorted by their 2nd order priorities.
[05:16:43] <Codaraxis> Since, generally, priority 2 tasks are of a higher priority than priority 3 tasks, but not all priority 2 tasks are equal to one another

[13:29:23] <mre> I have been keeping a journal in orgmode for years, using a datetree. The file is large and unwieldy. I tried archiving the previous year each january, but I'm not happy with that. My recent thought is to refile my archived entries into many ~/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.org files. My questions are: A) is this even a good move? do you have similar experiences and could weigh in? and B) How? is there an inbuilt thing 
[13:29:29] <mre> for this, or will i need to wrangle some elisp?

[13:46:19] <pjb> mre: what is unsatisfying in archiving yearly?  Perhaps some projects cover cross newyear?  Perhaps you'd want to write per-project journal files?
[13:50:27] <pjb> mre: otherwise, while storing each entry in a separate file, it could be convenient to show them (or a selection) in a single buffer.  This would indeed require some lisp code.  Perhaps indirect-buffer, but we'd need a way to concatenate several indirect-buffers into a single view.
[13:51:21] <pjb> There is also some "virtual buffer" notion, but I don't know if that could be useful.

[18:08:56] <ziman> hello! is there a (reasonably easy) way to ask org to reschedule some agenda items to a random date in, say, the coming month? i've got a bunch of todo items that i've been postponing and would prefer to avoid having to deal with the whole lot every day :)

[18:31:29] <davemq> ziman: Hmm, there's a way to mark some items in your agenda and bulk schedule them scattered across a day range. See 11.5 Commands in the Agenda Buffer
[18:32:21] <davemq> and within that page, search for org-agenda-bulk-action, then 'S'
[18:33:08] <ziman> > Reschedule randomly into the coming N days. N is prompted for. With a prefix argument (C-u B S), scatter only across weekdays
[18:33:17] <ziman> that sounds exactly like what i was looking for, many thanks!
[18:33:40] <davemq> Yeah, very handy. I learned that from Sascha Chua at an Emacs meetup

[19:06:26] <mre> Other than the archive file being enormous, I don't journal as much as I'd like, and seeing how long ago my last entry was can be intimidating (though that could be solved with narrow) I guess I just felt a multi file approach would help.

[19:25:39] <pjb> mre: that would also depend on the tools you use. If you use unix tools in bash (or even from emacs), it can indeed be useful to have multiple-files.  Eg. a grep -nHi keyword * # would list all the files (ie. dates) where the keyword is mentionned.

[21:21:48] <Tisoxin> Hi, i have a weird (nondeterministic) issue with org-capture. After choosing the template (it doesn't seem to matter which) it asks me which file to load from (i'm using ivy), and shows me the directory where all the agenda files lie. Has sb encountered this issue as well?

[21:22:56] <Tisoxin> Though it doesn't seem to matter which file a pick. The procedure after that is the same as normally, apart from the faces which apparently don't get applied in the template buffer (the font is monotone)
[21:24:30] <Tisoxin> I had this issue in 27.2 and have it in 28.0 emacs

[21:52:11] <rdrg109> mre: Yes, it is possible with some Elisp. Use org-map-entries and iterate through all the headings with LEVEL=3, in each headline use a let body to set org-archive-location to an appropiate value and then execute org-archive-subtree. I would like to help but I'm really busy right now
[21:53:35] <rdrg109> With "... in each headline use a let body ...", I mean "in each execution of FUNC when calling org-map-entries set org-archive-location within the LET so that the value is different for each headline.
