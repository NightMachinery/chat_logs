[00:13:34] <Z-module> Drives me crazy that it still gets taught in elementary/middle school.
[00:15:01] <Z-module> "1 2/3" means 1 + 2/3 = 3/3 + 2/3 = 5/3
[00:15:49] <Z-module> utterly absurd as a notation to use in equations

[00:18:29] <sonny> so it turns out math books are very precise and leave nothing wasted
[00:19:09] <sonny> if I knew that before I probably would not have wasted 20 or so pages trying to get the solution
[00:19:50] <euouae> fractions probably should be understood geometrically
[00:20:27] <euouae> I think the purely algebraic treatment means a lot of people forget what's the right thing to do
[00:20:32] <sonny> what does that mean?
[00:20:34] <Z-module> Nothing beyond middle-school level really ever uses mixed-fraction notation in math problems. Or if they do, they're crazy.
[00:20:47] <sonny> if it's visual then i'm interested
[00:21:08] <euouae> the fraction a/b means take a piece of wood
[00:21:25] <euouae> chop it into b equal parts
[00:21:28] <euouae> and then take a of them
[00:21:34] <biberao> Z-module: mixed fractions are good for one thing
[00:22:33] <euouae> Or, think of the straight line, and the unit segment 0 to 1 on it. Split it into b equal parts and take a of them. So 2/3, split the unit segment into 3 parts and take the first two. Where your second piece ends is the number 2/3
[00:23:00] <sonny> that's a good one
[00:23:06] <euouae> so to add a/b + c/d, you find a common splitting, where both a/b and c/d are aligned
[00:23:28] <euouae> for example, if you split the unit segment into 4 pieces and look at where 2/5 falls, it's not on the boundaries of the 4 equal segments
[00:23:52] <euouae> so if you wanted to add 1/4 to 2/5, you'd need to find some common (smaller) splitting where both 1/4 and 2/5 are on the boundaries

[03:30:01] <Guest40> sonny try again :)
[03:30:40] <sonny> 2 outcomes are M, F and it's 1 of 2
[03:30:48] <PlanckWalk> Guest40: Try properly defining the problem.
[03:31:16] <trombel> PlanckWalk: do you have a simple formula where i can equate it to 90k
[03:31:18] <PlanckWalk> Often if there are multiple children in a house and one answers the door, it's muct more likely to be the oldest one.
[03:31:18] <Guest40> PlanckWalk there's no trick to it. ask clarifying questions if you're confused
[03:31:23] <cherim> Suppose the moving circle is a rigid disk. Fix some moment of time, how do the (instant) velocities of the points of this rigid disk look? The velocity of C is clearly 0. The distances between  C and P as points on the disk doesn't change with time (disk is rigid), hence the velocity of P is perpendicular to PC
[03:31:53] <cherim> If it were not perpendicular, the distance PC would have a rate of change equal to the projection of this velocity onto PC
[03:31:55] <PlanckWalk> If we assign some probability p > 0.5 to the girl being the oldest one, you can calculate probabilities appropriately.
[03:32:11] <trombel> the last time i was here with a similar question it was answered with very simply in an understandable manner for someone who doesn't do grad math
[03:32:19] <Guest40> PlanckWalk assume only 2 kids in house and either kid has equal probability of answering
[03:32:36] <trombel> can anyone else shed some light on this
[03:32:42] <PlanckWalk> Aha, now we're getting somewhere
[03:33:27] <klf> https://imgur.com/a/TMZlGrM
[03:33:58] <PlanckWalk> The prior probabilities are 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 for two boys, one of each, and two girls respectively.
[03:34:30] <cherim> It's not the tangent line of the circle you move, it's the tangent line of the circle with center C and radius CP
[03:34:36] <cherim> I explained why above
[03:34:54] <PlanckWalk> The conditional probabilities of a girl answering are P(G|BB) = 0, P(G|GB) = 0.5, P(G|GG) = 1.

[03:35:14] <trombel> had a noob question. if say I invested 50 bucks a week into an investor account with a guaranteed 10% yearly return, how much would it account to in 15 yrs? would appreciate if you can give those answers in a formula that tells me how you came to that amount
[03:36:17] <klf> cherim:  I must've missed it.  I'll take a read.  Thanks ^^
[03:36:19] <trombel> we're not taking into account taxes or interest rate hikes or any suych
[03:36:38] <trombel> we're merely going by the amount invested and how much it would accumulate to in 15 yrs
[03:36:46] <sonny> so that's X per year + 10% 15 times
[03:37:05] <PlanckWalk> sonny: Looks like it isn't in this case
[03:37:16] <trombel> sonny: whats X per yr?
[03:37:36] <sonny> 50 * number of weeks in a year
[03:37:49] <trombel> so 50*52

[03:38:36] <trombel> i only mentioned it as a specific
[03:38:37] <PlanckWalk> Guest40: So P(G & BB) = 0, P(G & GB) = 1/4, P(G & GG) = 1/4 and so conditioning on G you get 50%.

[03:42:04] <biberao> im trying to learn those
[03:42:04] <sonny> trombel what I think is [2600 + 10% return] * 15
[03:42:08] <PlanckWalk> The answer you get depends *crucially* on exactly how the problem is worded.

[03:43:08] <sonny> probability or interest
[03:43:12] <trombel> sonny: that only amounts to 42k
[03:43:18] <trombel> as opposed to PlanckWalk claiming 90k
[03:43:26] <Z-module> tomathy:  from 0 to pi, the curve starts at 0 and peaks once and comes back to 0 exactly. But then from pi to 2pi it does that same thing downward.
[03:43:51] <PlanckWalk> sonny: Z-module asked a question to clarify how interest was calcualted, and trombel said that it was calculated baed on the *average* balance during the year, not final.
[03:44:07] <tomathy> Z-module: yes i know, i want to know the length of this curve
[03:44:07] <Z-module> so as a periodic function on R, sine's period is actually 2pi
[03:44:10] <trombel> sonny: your formula doesnt take into account how the 10% doubles every year because money isnt taken out
[03:44:17] <biberao> im trying to learn those Guest40 thats why i asked
[03:44:25] <Z-module> the arc length from (0,0) to (pi,0) ? one upward hump?
[03:44:29] <Guest40> @plankwalk there is a mistake in the events and sample space not matching the problem asked
[03:44:33] <sonny> trombel sure it does, I used a variable

[03:46:04] <trombel> sonny: that amounts to 42900

[03:47:17] <Z-module> that's only up to pi. Double that for up to 2pi.
[03:47:35] <tomathy> it can't be that much up to pi, you're wreong
[03:47:47] <trombel> sonny: 2600+260(yearly return) x 15 = 42900

[03:49:13] <trombel> huge discrepancy if you ask me
[03:49:17] <sonny> ok so
[03:49:19] <Z-module> f(x) = sin(x)  is a certain graph in the plane. It starts at (0,0) and peaks at (pi/2, 1) and comes back down to (pi, 0), The ARC LENGTH of that curve (that graph) is what I said. The analytic expression is  \int_[0,pi] sqrt(1 + cos^2(t)) dt
[03:49:23] <Z-module> cos being sin'
[03:50:12] <sonny> the return varies every year, so that's my bad for using times, your just gonna have to add
[03:50:27] <Z-module> and yes, t in radians
[03:50:44] <PlanckWalk> trombel: If you're paying in 2600 every year, and getting 10% interest on the average of initial and final balance each year, then the result is closer to $86k
[03:51:30] <PlanckWalk> I.e. you get $130 interest on the first year because your average balance through the year was $1300

You visit a house and one of the kids, a girl answers. What is the probability that the house you visited has two girls?
[03:54:10] <PlanckWalk> Guest40: I already told you that probability, given the additional information that a random child answers.
[03:54:24] <cherim> PlanckWalk is correct, it's 1/2 here
[03:54:28] <Guest40> @plankwalk and that answer was incorrect

[03:54:43] <cherim> https://www.theifod.com/the-two-child-paradox/ etc.
[03:54:59] <sonny> what's the catch it seems trivial
[03:55:04] <cherim> "oldest" is exactly equivalent to "randomly chosen"
[03:55:06] <PlanckWalk> There are very slight variations where the answer is different.  But those aren't the problem you asked.
[03:55:20] <Guest40> cherim no, oldest and randomly chosen are very different
[03:55:33] <tomathy> i forgot how you find the length of the curve in calculus

[03:56:04] <trombel> PlanckWalk: where are you getting 130 interest from?
[03:56:06] <cherim> You can compute the conditional probabilities for randomly chosen then, still 1/2

[03:56:45] <trombel> 50x52weeks is 2600
[03:56:46] <PlanckWalk> 0 at the start, 2600 at the end, linearly increasing
[03:56:54] <PlanckWalk> The midpoint is 1300

[07:02:24] <[itchyjunk]> Like F*
[07:02:37] <mycroftiv> Lean people actually do more work in this set theoretic area than agda people, they havea formalization of cohen forcing

[07:03:11] <mycroftiv> yes
[07:04:03] <sonny> oh ok, in your case you do this to help keep track of stuff?
[07:04:03] <mycroftiv> theres a whole range from metamath, Isabelle, Coq, Lean, related things like SAT solvers, various topological data analysis tools, model checkers, and of course computer algebra systems
[07:04:38] <mycroftiv> sonny: agda is the only way i found to actually learn set theory of large cardinals and ultrafilters on my own as a self-learner
[07:04:41] <[itchyjunk]> there is also wolfram alpha but maybe that's not math in the same sense
[07:05:17] <mycroftiv> itchy: thats more like a computer algebra system, but its all part of the spectrum i was referring to, proof assistant languages are kinda their own thing tho
[07:07:28] <mycroftiv> sonny: those files i linked, which are showing how filter-quotients in categories and sheaves are expressed set theoretically relative to constructive types - thats my work trying to *understand* the math notation and ideas
[07:07:31] <[itchyjunk]> use computers to formal prove math and math to formal prove computers.
[07:07:38] <[itchyjunk]> then we use chickens to formal prove both
[07:08:13] <sonny> oh interesting that it helped you learn stuff, it's also nice that stuff like software foundations is free
[07:08:16] <mycroftiv> because i just couldnt grasp what measurable cardinals and ultrapowers and model embeddings and sheaves and topoi were all about just from trying to read about them endlessly and stare at notation, i needed to get way more of a grip on things
[07:08:50] <sonny> programming does make more sense than math :P
[07:08:53] <mycroftiv> so learning to read the notation and formalize definitions and theorems and evaluate examples was how i found to teach myself what things meant
[07:09:04] <Galois> well I didn't even understand real numbers until last year, 20 years after my phd, when I formalized the whole thing in coq

[07:10:11] <sonny> did you have to make the other sets too?
[07:11:02] <Galois> I didn't have to make the rationals (coq has rationals built in, two versions even, and three versions of reals built in)

[07:49:57] <Decker> math proves everything? :)
[07:50:13] <[itchyjunk]> no, math has proofs.
[07:50:21] <Decker> https://github.com/d3x0r/STFRPhysics/blob/master/math/TheNotBang.md#eample-of-sum-of-expanded-space sorry - I did write more workds about it...
[07:50:34] <[itchyjunk]> what does it predict that GR doesn't?
[07:51:47] <Decker> that we could got 14B lgiht years and see more universe; and that 14B years has nothing to do with 'the beginning of time'
[07:52:08] <mycroftiv> i think the conventional cosmological understanding has strong and compelling evidence
[07:52:20] <[itchyjunk]> yes, agreed mycroftiv
[07:52:32] <[itchyjunk]> it has too strong of predictive power just to toss out the window
[07:52:50] <Decker> the hubble constant is just the average mass of the universe
[07:52:51] <[itchyjunk]> any new model should make verifiable predictions else it's value is very limited
[07:53:10] <Decker> uhmm what prediction can the big bang provide?
[07:53:14] <[itchyjunk]> how can the constant be "average mass" of a universe whose size is unknwn?
[07:53:31] <[itchyjunk]> big bang is a consiqunce
[07:53:34] <mycroftiv> i have put a lot of effort into learning how to avoid being a crank
[07:53:35] <Decker> it's the mass of what photons have passed by ... not what is behind them
[07:53:45] <Decker> what's behind them is already accounted for where it's emitted
[07:54:00] <mycroftiv> and the essence of not being a crank is understanding the published literature and not proclaiming its all wrong based on your own more limited intuitions
[07:54:00] <[itchyjunk]> size of universe is probably infinite..
[07:54:30] <[itchyjunk]> mycroftiv, agreed
[07:54:36] <Decker> it's not all wrong; the math is still the same
[07:54:46] <[itchyjunk]> the math doesn't work out for QM
[07:54:52] <Decker> red shift still happens, it is affected by source mass... light is still gravitationally lensed
[07:54:57] <[itchyjunk]> so if the math is same, you're in the same hole
[07:55:08] <[itchyjunk]> what's gravity in your model?
[07:55:10] <Decker> well QM is what fills the hole
[07:55:29] <Decker> differential in spatial gradients; making clocks move slower
[07:55:55] <Decker> same as is understood
[07:55:59] <[itchyjunk]> sounds like a rehashing of GR
[07:56:17] <[itchyjunk]> it means your model is not compatable with QM as is
[07:56:30] <[itchyjunk]> so what problem does it solve other than claiming universe is actually not expanding?
[07:56:48] <Decker> that's it :) it's not so much of a solution as a observation
[07:57:03] <[itchyjunk]> what "observation" ?
[07:57:23] <[itchyjunk]> red shift isn't the only thing explained by expanding universe
[07:57:32] <[itchyjunk]> there are others too now
[07:57:37] <Decker> that space stretches the more mass is behind it if you're going through space without interferance
[07:57:39] <[itchyjunk]> you'll have to explain all those
[07:57:59] <[itchyjunk]> vaccume energy is already a thing
[07:58:11] <[itchyjunk]> thats not something novel in your hypothesis
[07:58:20] <Decker> ?

[07:58:41] <[itchyjunk]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy
[07:59:59] <Decker> right casmir - the plates are not pushed together by an expanding universe
[08:00:20] <Decker> trying to relate it to the expansion of the universe seems to be the problem there
[08:00:53] <[itchyjunk]> you are saying the current model isn't correct and yours is. but yours makes 0 new prediction and just gives alternative explanation to every experimental effect
[08:01:16] <Decker> the current model has no predictions; it's just a creation myth that requires things be expanding
[08:01:47] <[itchyjunk]> ?
[08:01:52] <[itchyjunk]> ok, if you say so

[08:05:59] <mycroftiv> its odd because you do seem more educated about a lot of this than i am, so i feel like i may just be confused, but when you say standard physics is all wrong, i feel like the ideas may not actually be coherent in the same way as the conventional model
[08:06:09] <Decker> mycroftiv I've heard that from plank_walk a while ago; and from this discord channel too.... that's because I gleamed an understanding and threw away all the top layers since they're all derivities and products of the space being dispalced
[08:06:40] <Decker> and don't actually control space curvature at all... so when everything is based on the reciprocal and there's no other approach this way I do the best I can; please though what is so hard to grok?
[08:07:06] <Galois> what's hard to grok is that you should know the definition of science. Without testable hypotheses you're not doing science.
[08:07:27] <Decker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmjbpIgVKF   this was a lot of the basis of understanading; and several things around this that had other background.
[08:08:35] <Decker> there was a video in this that had a good covering of intrinsic vs extrinsic curvature... this intro says it's there but I think it was another
[08:08:44] <yBtNJW3j> Hmm ...
[08:08:52] <Galois> for example there's this picture: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe#/media/File:WMAP_2008_TT_and_TE_spectra.png
[08:09:08] <Galois> the curves are the predictions, made _before_ the experiment was performed. The dots and bars are the measurements.
[08:09:45] <Galois> this isn't creationism myth. There was a hypothesis, and a prediction. It was tested, and measured, and validated.

[08:10:49] <Decker> adn the relation to redshift etc
[08:11:03] <Galois> regardless, there was a hypothesis whose outcome was not known in advance
[08:11:07] <Galois> you can't even say that much!
[08:11:08] <Decker> it doesn't change the math... just the units really; instead of m/t it's just m; and mass..
[08:11:34] <Galois> and there are interesting deviations from the prediction, which you may notice, if you're not too busy denying the definition of science

[08:14:14] <yBtNJW3j> Gathering data and analysis seems like an important part of science to me.  It sounds or seems more philosophical, subjective, or controversial to go into testable hypotheses.  What is testable?  Hypothetical?  How much so and how grounded is it?
[08:14:37] <Galois> if you have a hypothesis and the quibble is whether or not it is testable, we can go there
[08:14:46] <Galois> but so far Decker hasn't put forward ANY hypothesis!
[08:15:21] <Decker> hypothesis - take for granted that space is curved, and apply the math to curve space; does it result with gravitational behavior?  that much was a yes.
[08:15:40] <Galois> that's not a hypothesis. You need to make a prediction that deviates from standard theory.
[08:15:57] <Galois> if your model simply matches standard theory identically with zero differences then it's not a new theory
[08:16:06] <Decker> that the space is progressively stretched such that light travels further than it should in the same time is another observation; but if the redshift ends up getting assigned to that, then there isn't any left for expansion
[08:16:20] <Decker> since redshift happens; eventually anything that is light is shifted to radio
[08:16:33] <Galois> ok, what experiment did you perform, whose results would have been A under standard theory, and B under your theory, and A ≠ B, and you did the experiment, and you got B?
[08:17:42] <Galois> there are six requests in that question. I would be happy to start with the first one, recognizing that a new theory won't have everything in place all at once
[08:17:46] <Galois> where did you START?
[08:17:56] <Galois> what experiment could you perform? What is A? What is B?

[08:20:28] <Decker> the experiement was to apply the math that curves space, only in 3d and ignoring time; time's easy to add as an animation effect if required
[08:20:41] <Decker> so the result I get is in meters; the result that exists is in meter/sec
[08:20:43] <Galois> I don't think you understand what an experiment is, and this isn't a minor quibble
[08:20:56] <Decker> I don't think you get what qualifies for experiment
[08:21:13] <mycroftiv> decker: just making computer graphics that represent your ideas is different than gathering data about the physical world and having predictions about it
[08:21:16] <Decker> do I need to setup lights and grow tables with stawberry plants and watch them for weeks on end?
[08:21:23] <Galois> an experiment involves real-world observation, and a description of how to replicate your observation
[08:21:34] <Galois> basically, yes, you need to watch or listen or sense something
[08:21:46] <Galois> I'll give an example. MOND was killed by the observation of the bullet cluster.
[08:22:00] <Galois> MOND cannot explain why the dark matter is in a different place than the ordinary matter
[08:22:10] <[itchyjunk]> you can't say your hypothesis is GR compatable but use some other topological space other than spacetime without showing some type of homemorphism or osmething between them
[08:22:13] <Decker> right; so I took the real world information, and developed a method to replicate the observations
[08:22:41] <Decker> it's not a different topological space
[08:22:51] <Decker> there's only space
[08:23:01] <[itchyjunk]> spacetime is 4 dimensional
[08:23:02] <Galois> that's not science. You need to specify an observation that would have different outcomes under your theory vs standard theory
[08:23:05] <[itchyjunk]> yours isn't
[08:23:08] <Decker> it's generating the space differently maybe

[08:23:41] <[itchyjunk]> but that's now how it is in GR, so you have to prove compatibility with GR
[08:23:45] <[itchyjunk]> you don't get it for free
[08:23:51] <yBtNJW3j> Some do not necessarily agree on the number of steps in scientific investigations.  For example, the book at which I am looking shows making predictions and modifying explanations as possible courses of action but also simplifies it down to collecting observations, developing explanations, and testing those explanations.  (If I recall correctly, advanced scientists will often specialize in certain areas or steps also.)
[08:23:52] <Decker> Galois the only expectation I had was that redshift was caused by distance and mass and not time
[08:23:55] <[itchyjunk]> you said your math is equivalent to relativity
[08:24:26] <Galois> and if so, what differences would that make to an observation?
[08:24:36] <Galois> If it makes no difference to any observation then it's not a new theory
[08:24:52] <Galois> what is your experiment? What is A? What is B?
[08:24:59] <[itchyjunk]> space and time aren't things you separate in relativity though, spacetime is a topological space with some pseudo metric on it
[08:26:11] <Decker> [itchyjunk] sure you could say that.
[08:26:26] <Decker> though you can't prove time is a thing - you can't rotate around time... or move otherwise than forward in time
[08:26:30] <[itchyjunk]> yes then you'ed have to show some mathematical equivalence between what you're saying and GR
[08:26:38] <[itchyjunk]> prove?
[08:26:43] <[itchyjunk]> GR makes good predictions
[08:26:46] <[itchyjunk]> like gravitational waves
[08:26:57] <Decker> yup - because the displacment change size
[08:26:58] <[itchyjunk]> it would take a hell of a new model to kick it out
[08:27:00] <Decker> which cuases space to bounce
[08:27:04] <[itchyjunk]> you're just saying random words
[08:27:12] <Decker> not to mention that their dipslacments are big enough to cause a wave motion
[08:27:14] <mycroftiv> since this is a math channel, is there anyone with some knowledge of standard definitions of basic set theory and topology to grill me about some math involved in my work to make sure im coherently situated?
[08:28:17] <Decker> see - especially since observations by LIGO ... became even more convinced that space might be a thing that can be displaced
[08:28:35] <Decker> could probably even slice off a bit of it in a bubble like the alcubierre drive and move space within space
[08:28:46] <Decker> but I have no way to describe that mechanism to make an experiment.

[18:24:11] <isekaijin> If X is just a set, then we can take Free(X) to turn it into an R-vector space. But if X has more structure, then maybe this is not the right thing to do.
[18:24:34] <isekaijin> In any case, what structure could you be considering that has to be taken into account?
[18:24:47] <isekaijin> Maybe X has a topology and you want maps X -> R to be continuous.
[18:25:27] <Gurkenglas> Depends on the setting - by happenstance I've found multiple potential applications. But yes, topological structure appears in one of the settings. The hope is that one can work abstractly.
[18:25:32] <isekaijin> Or maybe X is a measure space and you want maps X -> R to be measurable. Although I don't think there are many nice things to say about the category of measurable spaces.

[21:00:35] <Z-module> That's not typically the subject of a chapter or an article, by itself.
[21:01:21] <Z-module> But are you asking for a good exposition of why they're defined as they are, how they enable quotient rings?
[21:01:39] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[21:02:16] <[itchyjunk]> Was that the motivation? to enable quotient rings?
[21:02:48] <Z-module> pretty much, I'd say
[21:02:59] *** Quits: Rum (~bourbon@user/rum) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[21:04:12] <Z-module> If R is a ring with 1 and J is simply an additive subgroup, then the *additive* quotient group R/J = {all cosets r + J : r in R} always makes sense.  But you can't get  (r + J)(s + J) = rs + J   to work out unless J is an ideal.
[21:05:21] <[itchyjunk]> Ah, I need to start with groups and normal subgroups then. i'll refresh those
[21:05:44] <[itchyjunk]> at least i think it was normal subgroups that let me quotient the groups to get new subgroups

[21:14:02] <Z-module> If H is non-normal, {all left cosets gH} and {all right cosets Hg} are distinct, in fact they only have eH = He = H in common, *and* furthermore, defining group multiplication in either of those sets by use of representatives will always fail to work out.
[21:15:08] <Z-module> but at least those two sets always have the same cardinality, so that the number |G:H| is always meaningful, regardless of normality of H.
[21:15:56] <[itchyjunk]> right i remember the part where cosets(?) partition(?) the group into equal size sets
[21:16:25] <Z-module> cadmio, I think they did mean you, but you already know that a normal subgroup containing one 3-cycle contains all of them. That formula is the proof of that.

[21:19:41] <Z-module> (at the moment, I don't remember why that's true)
[21:25:40] <Z-module> Looked it up: it involves a bunch of cases of different cycle types occurring in N, and some nontrivial calculating. It's not one of those two-line easy things such as |G:H| = 2 => H normal.
[21:26:05] <Z-module> You're supposed to prove it totally without hints, cadmio?
[21:26:16] <cadmio> one way could be on going by cases, you set the form of an element in N do the conjugate and see whether it's a 3-cycle
[21:27:29] <Z-module> conjugating s in S_n or A_n always gives something with the same exact cycle type as s.  You have to mess around more than that, taking various products.
[21:27:47] <cadmio> the only hint is: First, prove that N contains a 3-cycle.  Second prove that then it contains all 3-cycles, and since the 3-cycles generate An, we conclude that N = An.
