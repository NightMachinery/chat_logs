[19:15:01] * Bunny351 uses links in graphical mode now, as it avoids clogging up memory with JS bloat
[19:46:58] <Irvise> I have played around with it. It is getting better every release.
[19:54:16] <ente> compiling it as we speak
[19:54:46] <ente> JS bloat would be nice if it were still avoidable in this day and age but most websites aren't functional without
[19:55:16] <ente> I mean, most that are targeting programmersare
[19:55:35] <ente> hm
[19:55:45] <ente> maybe I can get rid of javascript too
[20:18:11] <Zipheir> links is nice indeed.
[20:26:57] <Bunny351> so far, most websites I'm interested in are ok (more or less) without JS. I have actually more problems with certificates...
[20:30:17] <Bunny351> the crazy thing is that in this age of "diversity" and "inclusiveness", many websites give a shit about people who are colorblind or need screenreaders.
[20:40:26] <Zipheir> Yes.  I've tried to make that point to some people operating all-dynamic-and-useless-without-js sites.
[20:41:41] <Zipheir> It is a massive accessibility issue, and most site designers are ignoring it completely.
[20:41:51] <Bunny351> vandusen: javascript:void()
[20:41:54] <vandusen> Bunny351: THE AIR HAS BECOME A HEAVILY DISPERSED LAKE!?
[20:55:31] <ente> I wouldn't go so far and single out JS as the single root of all evil like one of my friends does
[20:56:12] <ente> I mean, sure, it ain't pretty, and it is often obfuscated and not made for you to tinker with it
[20:56:14] <Bunny351> when it comes to software, there are many evils, indeed.
[20:56:33] <ente> but the same is true for most "computers" that are called "smartphone" or "tablet"
[20:56:51] <ente> you buy a full fledged computer and then you aren't allow to do with it as you please
[20:57:14] <Zipheir> Also an idea I'd like to see dumped by society.
[20:57:24] <Bunny351> I like the fast browsing experience. no tons of JS loaded, clogging up my system (which is a real problem on my machine (OpenBSD + firefox))
[21:01:17] <ente> as much as I can relate, this isn't the way the world is "progressing"
[21:07:53] <Zipheir> There are many worlds.  Depending on what you do on the Web, you may not use JS very often.
[21:09:14] <ente> does github still work without js?
[21:09:30] <Bunny351> and "progress" is too vague a concept to have any meaning
[21:09:32] <Bunny351> yes
[21:09:33] <Bunny351> sort of
[21:09:47] <Zipheir> As a git repository host, yes.
[21:09:48] <Bunny351> at least for browsing
[21:10:15] <Bunny351> looks terrible, but enough to view files
[21:11:33] <Zipheir> https://github.com/cli/cli is helpful for avoiding all of their obfuscated JS soup.
[21:11:55] <Zipheir> ("GitHub loves open-source!"  Sure, right...)
[21:15:00] <ente> https://paste.xinu.at/0ag7/
[21:16:35] <ente> there aren't many companies whose love for open source goes beyond milking it for free labour
[21:16:54] <ente> or in github's case I'd say it's about free publicity
[21:18:50] <florz> ... and establishing proprietary standard software among developers, just as with word for office workers
[21:23:24] <dstolfa_> Zipheir: at this point whenever i see "open source" mentioned by a company, i already feel like rolling my eyes out of my eyesockets. it's sad, really
[21:23:56] <dstolfa_> i don't think there's anything wrong with them just admitting they want to use it in their product and not care about it, but i hate that they pretend to care beyond: "please don't blow my product up"
[21:50:25] <Corbin> It's especially frustrating to say "I produce Free Software" and get the response "oh, yeah, our company does Open Source too"
[21:53:20] <Zipheir> dstolfa_: Yes.  I'm really annoyed when companies (e.g. GitHub, Discord) pretend to *advocate* for FOSS while explicitly developing a proprietary product.
[21:58:00] <Zipheir> It makes Steve Ballmer's "it's a communist virus!" attitude seme refreshingly genuine. :)

[23:02:42] <Irvise> AFAIK, the only systems that are not mostly controlled by corps are the *BSD family and minor OSs... FreeBSD gets a lot contributed by companies, but they do not seem to be pressuring anything there. OpenBSD cannot be touched appart from the people that steer it and NetBSD is the definition of a community OS.
[23:04:00] <mario-goulart> There's the Apple BSD. :-)
[23:11:17] <Irvise> Darwin?
[23:11:24] <mangol> yes. thankfully Apple only copied code from *BSD, AFAIK they didn't try to take over BSD foundations with their own representatives
[23:12:31] <mangol> Linux Foundation is a front organization to enable the household name corporations to set the technical and social direction of Linux
[23:16:15] <mario-goulart> I think Apple just forks, does whatever they have to do and ship binaries.  It doesn't even make much sense to try to take over BSD foundations.

[23:19:01] <mangol> they ship (or shipped) source for a large part of Darwin too, but it's not that attractive since the graphics layers are the main draw (no pun intended) of MacOS/iOS
[23:19:38] <dTal> Isn't that basically the point of the BSD license
[23:19:48] <mangol> without the GUI, 3D, audio, etc. APIs, you basically have a BSD with the source for random bits missing
[23:25:10] <mario-goulart> What's worse about Apple is the contracts, as far as I know.  They are very restrictive regarding allowing employees to work on open source projects.  Example: they've kidnapped Sawfish's author.
[23:26:24] <mario-goulart> ... a rare lisper.
[23:27:35] <mangol> that sucks :/ goes to show that RMS was right about corporations (i.e. all companies of a given size tend toward the same character, irrespective of who works there at any given time)
[23:29:47] <mangol> i guess the TL;DR is that successful companies are started by makers and then taken over by politicians
[23:30:57] <mangol> or the makers become politicians, or are enticed/strong-armed by politicians from elsewhere
[23:33:34] <dstolfa_> Irvise: i don't think there's a problem with companies being engaged in development of an OS. i also don't think there's a problem with them using it. i just don't like all the marketing around "we love open source" that i keep seeing everywhere, without any engagement from said companies. in fact, if anything most of these companies that i see say this are making it *difficult* for me to use open

[23:56:21] <Zipheir> It's something of a false dichotomy.  A project with enough people involved will have politics.  It's very difficult to manage such a project if your perspective is "I only make things, I don't do politics".
