[01:11:13] <borodust> dto Jach: finally i finished github action for bundle delivery and now i have a binary actually built with glibc from lts distrib. it's is here: https://github.com/borodust/alien-works-demo/releases/tag/v0
[01:11:29] <borodust> once again i'm asking for your machine support ;p
[01:14:41] <borodust> it's unlikely to run on custom gentoo though cuz i'm still not sure what happened last time

[01:53:34] <Jach> borodust: looks like the same issue, https://pastebin.com/25C2LLwm My MX VM seems to die in the same place (no longer on the glibc part at least)

[02:35:08] <mfiano> borodust: did you not do the game jam last time?

[02:36:08] <borodust> noice!
[02:36:45] <mfiano> i took over this channel because i think it was davexunit that registered it but haven't heard from him in months
[02:37:04] <borodust> this time ill certainly participate as alien-works ready for shipment
[02:37:10] <mfiano> needed to be able to announce game jams like before :)

[05:20:21] <Jach> borodust: I compiled the .a files in filament's latest release into an .so and ran using that instead of your libfilament.clawed.so, this at least gets me to the actual lisp debugger in alien-works-demo:run with an error "The alien function "__claw__ZN8filament6Engine6createENS_7backend7BackendEPNS1_8PlatformEPv" is undefined."
[05:20:25] <Jach> So maybe the issue has to do with whatever your claw stuff is doing.
[05:49:45] <Jach> I've also been trying to build filament myself, but I think my llvm environment is borked or something. Still, maybe you can try updating your build script in aw-filament to include one/both of the cmake options FILAMENT_REQUIRES_CXXABI=true and USE_STATIC_LIBCCXX=true
[05:54:08] <Jach> er, s/true/ON

[10:00:11] <borodust> Jach: yeh, it could be claw stuff
[10:00:47] <borodust> as for abi and static linking - i already do that
[10:02:16] <borodust> to build filament you can use https://github.com/borodust/aw-filament/tree/master/src/lib
[10:02:35] <borodust> $ build.sh desktop
[10:03:42] <borodust> my guess so far is that i probably link c++ dynamically somewhere else and that might somehow interfere
[10:06:40] <borodust> strange that it works for me on manjaro while the whole thing is built on ubuntu
[10:07:19] <borodust> so it should be sorta cross compatible...
[10:07:45] <borodust> i wonder what's difference could be in our environments
