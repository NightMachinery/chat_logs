[00:00:17] <gamara> in development just put the whole animal in the container
[00:00:20] <tabakhase> gamara "you wouldnt want to" ore like
[00:00:37] <tabakhase> cause hot reload vs having to go to terminal run a docker build uhhhhh :P
[00:00:42] <gamara> thanks for helping me with this stuff it is helping to clear my confusion
[00:00:43] <ash_worksi> gamara: I wouldn't do that even in developement
[00:01:09] <gamara> wait so I should use multistaging?
[00:01:22] <ash_worksi> composer is for php deps; if I want to require something, I would `docker exec -it my-php-app bash` and run `composer require ...`
[00:01:56] <tabakhase> gamara key is kinda that "those are different thing" - 'building a image with your app' is a whole different train that "use docker as runtime to run your app"
[00:02:08] <ash_worksi> but for node, that's different, I don't think I would install node into a php container... that's just my instinct
[00:03:47] <ash_worksi> I would probably have a node container; when I have it outputing assets that look good, then I would create an ephemeral service in docker-compose that runs npm scripts and exits.

[00:04:32] <gamara> I need to be able to watch for changes in development
[00:04:51] <gamara> I suppose you could just run have dev --watch
[00:04:53] <ash_worksi> you can spin up a node container with HMR if you want, that's totally fine
[00:04:57] <gamara> and that would keep the container running
[00:05:00] <ash_worksi> I just wouldn't put that inside the PHP container
[00:05:08] <gamara> what is HMR?
[00:05:14] <ash_worksi> hot-module replacement
[00:05:45] <ash_worksi> or you could run nodemon
[00:05:51] <ash_worksi> I think that's popular in the node-universe
[00:06:20] <gamara> oh yeah
[00:06:24] <gamara> i have heard of it
[00:06:48] <gamara> I am making a symfony project so development server is supplied by symfony
[00:07:07] <gamara> first dev job need to learn the framework so I don't get fired :S
[00:07:27] <ash_worksi> symfony is a great framework, but you're better off in #symfony
[00:07:39] <ash_worksi> (personally, I do not use the symfony dev server)
[00:07:42] <gamara> yeah but I want to know more about docker haha
[00:08:00] <gamara> don't you need to to get the symfony profiler
[00:08:06] <ash_worksi> no
[00:08:18] <gamara> man I am so confused
[00:08:22] <gamara> which is good it means I am learning
[00:08:24] <tabakhase> if that also means learning php, id almost recommend to skip on docker for now :P - and do the classic VM route, muuuuch simpler to setup and way les problems to learn about at the start... use Vagrant instead of a manualy-build box if you want it fancy ;-)
[00:08:24] <ash_worksi> symfony is well isolated into components; you can just install the profiler using composer
[00:08:33] <gamara> I already know PHP haha

[00:11:36] <gamara> thank you for tolerating my stupid questions
[00:12:30] <gamara> oh so the profiler will just be deliever via php
[00:12:49] <ash_worksi> "delievered"?
[00:13:42] <ash_worksi> my guess is the answer to your question is "yes", albeit strangely asked.
[00:13:58] <ash_worksi> also, `composer require --dev profiler`
[00:14:01] <gamara> well I am a noob lol
[00:14:48] <ash_worksi> your server/Dockerfile is strange to me
[00:15:03] <gamara> my understanding is that when you make a request for an endpoint that deleivers content via php, the php server delievers the content
[00:15:14] <ash_worksi> that's true
[00:15:51] <tabakhase> dont worry, here docker is the stupid one when getting into it, not you ;-) - i like to say there is no learning curve in docker... more a series of steps with long stretches of WTF?! befoe it goes 'click' and suddenly the last 4 hours make perfect sense ;D
[00:16:17] <gamara> that is a 100% true as someone who is learning it

[08:13:57] <maxzor> I see the overlap between compose and Dockerfile and flexibility that emanes from it. In my - still probably uninformed - opinion, compose should not deal with building, it should be left to dockerfiles. 
[08:19:11] <tabakhase> maxzor  that is the case already
[08:19:28] <tabakhase> you just toss a build section with a dockerfile in the compose
[08:19:59] <tabakhase> and you editing that dockerfile wont do anything unless you "docker-compose build" or "docker-compose --build up" sure
[08:21:06] <tabakhase> and in the end compose just issues the very same api-calls to docker-daemon that your "docker-cli" would
[08:21:38] <maxzor> I understand, I just expected that "docker compose up" would rebuild. I can understand the each piece of flexibility, but it comes in the end at the cost of a hardest learning curve.
[08:24:24] <maxzor> s/the each piece/the different pieces/
[08:24:30] <maxzor> s/hardest/harder
[08:25:15] <tabakhase> no such thing as a learning curve in docker ;-) - more a series of steps with stretchs of wtf?!s until it goes click and suddenly the last 4 hours make perfect sense :D

[11:41:57] <foul_owl> How do a stop a docker container that won't respond to "docker stop"
[11:43:05] <dodo> how long did you wait?
[11:48:49] <foul_owl> 10 minutes
[11:49:34] <dodo> so killing doesn't kill the container?
[11:51:32] <foul_owl> I tried "docker stop" and "docker kill", working my way through the signals
[11:51:44] <foul_owl> basically doesn't seem to respond at all
[11:51:58] <foul_owl> The actual host system is fine, no problems whatsoever
[11:52:22] <foul_owl> load average is around 2, plenty of ram and disk free
[11:52:33] <dodo> how do you know the container is actually up?
[11:54:37] <foul_owl> I was seeing log output from a job running in it
[11:55:05] <dodo> interesting..
[11:55:26] <foul_owl> This particular job stopped providing output for 30 min, so I figured it was dead and figured I would just kill the container
[11:55:27] <dodo> can you try to restart the docker daemon?
[11:55:33] <foul_owl> Good call!
[11:56:11] <dodo> (fwiw, depending on the logging it might still do something)
[11:58:22] <foul_owl> I stopped docker with "systemctl stop docker" but it took a few minutes
[11:58:29] <foul_owl> now it seems like it's not starting
[11:58:49] <foul_owl> Should I nuke the container from the filesystem before trying to start docker?
[12:01:02] <foul_owl> How do I remove a container without using the "docker" command?

[22:27:01] <queue-> yo so i have opnsense up and working, did you get wireguard working on this?
[22:27:27] <queue-> i deployed kubernetes but i keep getting stupid Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate is valid for 10.13.37.39, 10.13.37.40, 10.13.37.41, 10.13.37.43, 10.43.0.1, 127.0.0.1, not <routerIP of opnsense>
[22:27:55] <queue-> i know i need to throw a --tls-san flag to add it and i did, with k3s server --tls-san <routerIP>
[22:28:12] <queue-> but ultimately i'd like to get wireguard properly working here, any help rawtaz?

[22:28:33] <queue-> i was able to get opnsense shell connected to the wireguard vpn, i tangled one of the rules somewhere
[22:28:43] <queue-> it would ping out but my k3s nodes had 0 connectivity

[22:30:40] <rawtaz> queue-: i never tried wireguard in docker but i thikn ive seen articles about it so i expect it to work
[22:30:55] <queue-> nah i meant wireguard on opnsense
[22:31:24] <rawtaz> oh ok. you should probably ask in the opnsense channel then :)
[22:31:40] <rawtaz> err wait
[22:31:42] <rawtaz> waht are you saying
[22:31:47] <rawtaz> you have it working on opnsense, ok good
[22:31:51] <rawtaz> and now you are asking about containers
[22:31:56] <queue-> nah
[22:32:01] <queue-> i cant ping out via k3s
[22:32:13] <queue-> so i messed up a rule somewhere in opnsense
[22:32:43] <rawtaz> you are seriosuly bad at making yourself clear. please stop assuming others can read your mind
[22:32:55] <rawtaz> are you saying that you are having trouble *connecting to a wireguard vpn* from inside a contianer on k8s?
[22:33:11] <queue-> so i have k3s-master-01, k3s-master-02, k3s-master-03 they are all VM's housed in proxmox underneath opnsense
[22:33:23] <queue-> none of those VM's have ping after setting up opnsense
[22:33:38] <queue-> with wireguard.
[22:33:45] <queue-> without wireguard, im fine.
[22:34:03] <rawtaz> haha wow, wait, are you running opnsense on hardware, and on top of that proxmox (as a package in opnsense i suppose), and in that k3s nodes? :D
[22:34:14] <queue-> no, opnsense is in a VM too
[22:34:15] <queue-> lol
[22:34:21] <queue-> im just using it for dhcp/port forwarding/gui
[22:34:30] <rawtaz> this is like a super-bling christmas tree hehe
[22:34:41] <queue-> yea lol
[22:36:47] <rawtaz> well im sorry but i cant help you, simply because i cant even make out wth youre doing. your descriptions suck. e.g. "none of those VM's have ping after setting up opnsense". christ..
[22:36:55] <rawtaz> sorry about that :)
[22:37:03] <rawtaz> im not on the same level as you are

[22:41:00] <queue-> yea i just dont think u understand waht im saying because you've never worked with k3s
[22:41:11] <queue-> its deployed on VM's in proxmox, and those VM's cant ping out
[22:41:16] <queue-> idk if this is too complex but its really not
[22:41:22] <queue-> maybe for some
[22:42:08] <queue-> i even gave you the order that it happened, opnsense can ping out fine, but the VM's had no ping, no internet, the same ones ive been talking about here over and over

[23:30:04] <queue-> and we have liftoff
[23:45:49] <tabakhase> Tach that kinda "should be impossible" - dockr-cli and compose use that very same api to tell docker-daemon what todo
[23:46:35] <Tach> tabakhase still it is like it... I can't help it so far but investigating furter. 
[23:47:45] <tabakhase> where/how are yu running? docker-for-XY / native? - versions? - os of host? -- and "how does it fail", liek does it die or never works in the first place, then for all single or random containers, does it fix itself ever?
