[15:36:16] <Crocodillian> only utf8 has a BOM right?
[15:36:24] <Crocodillian> or is that any unicode
[15:37:47] <Crocodillian> yeah did you try adding a BOM?
[15:38:32] <jotham> hey hey
[15:39:05] <jotham> i'm here to be a massive fantasist like the carbonflux
[15:39:17] <jotham> in fact i'm so much of a disaster prostitute
[15:39:27] <jotham> that i've left thi up for 24 hours
[15:39:40] <jotham> which reenforces carb has no friends
[15:39:47] <jotham> and neither do i
[15:40:05] <Crocodillian> doesn't matter, we love you both anyway
[15:40:05] <jotham> he must be very pleased
[15:40:10] <jotham> he's gonnda die alone

[15:40:21] <jotham> because no one gives a shit
[15:40:33] <jotham> this is me supporting him
[15:42:20] <Crocodillian> why do people on transifex keep asking me for bizarre locales like en-BR
[15:42:28] <jotham> what
[15:42:28] <Crocodillian> wtf do I care what english they speak in Brazil
[15:42:32] <jotham> i'm from new zealand
[15:42:36] <jotham> so that's my locale
[15:42:49] <Crocodillian> yeah well new zealand is an actual english-speaking country
[15:42:54] <Crocodillian> but like, poland is not
[15:42:58] <Crocodillian> and neither is Brazil
[15:43:01] <jotham>  iand i am an english speaker
[15:43:05] <jotham> and i hate american english
[15:43:10] <jotham> what's your problem
[15:43:58] <jotham> americans are actively retarding our language
[15:44:05] <jotham> you are not a ntiave speaker
[15:44:14] <jotham> please define your complaint
[15:44:20] <jotham> because our language is being buggered
[15:44:23] <jotham> aggressively
[15:44:39] <jotham> aggressively buggered by weird american shitheads
[15:44:44] <jotham> yodu must know this
[15:45:19] <jotham> i like you, do not know how to fix it
[15:45:39] <jotham> but there is a lot more interest in the english language than the american disaster it's becoming
[15:47:13] <jotham> i reckon contemporary histroy doesn't transpose american failure
[15:47:31] <jotham> and as a americans you probably have some opinions about that
[15:47:51] <jotham> as foreign anglosaxons we just think you guys fucked up, failed
[15:47:55] <jotham> and elected the orange man
[15:47:57] <jotham> haha
[15:48:07] <jotham> so i don't think we have a good idea either
[15:48:19] <jotham> you have to have elected the orange man for a good reason
[15:48:26] <jotham> we're genetically similar
[15:48:29] <Renderwww> did we get reminded today?
[15:49:36] <jotham> dunno just woke up
[15:49:55] <jotham> working night shift fucks your entire life up aye
[15:50:08] <jotham> when i went to sleep this channel was probably fine
[15:50:17] <jotham> whne i woke up i killed 3 gay black meen
[15:50:21] <jotham> so i dunno
[15:51:13] <jotham> having 3 cellphones doesn't help
[15:51:17] <jotham> they are all on charge
[15:51:38] <jotham> i feel like that isn't an american thing
[15:51:44] <jotham> but a programmer does need
[15:52:22] <jotham> tax is a function of cellphone coverage not society
[15:53:17] <Renderwww> you start to sound like a chatbot
[15:53:20] <Renderwww> https://i.4cdn.org/v/1647691630226.jpg
[15:53:53] <jotham> pretty weird that isn't the first time this week
[15:54:06] <jotham> sorry also, it's weird
[15:55:05] <jotham> i private messaged ERROH this week
[15:55:13] <jotham> to ask if he thought i was alive
[15:55:27] <jotham> he gave a non committal answer
[15:55:34] <jotham> so i may be a bot
[16:03:59] <Renderwww> the great philosophical question that plagues humankind for centuries: are we just bots
[16:04:25] <jotham> lol
[16:05:00] <jotham> i'm not a fancy queen like carb
[16:05:08] <jotham> i read a few books
[16:05:14] <jotham> and i think we might all just be shit
[16:05:50] *** jotham changes topic to 'Hu me, i'm made of compliance.'
[16:06:16] *** jotham changes topic to 'Hug me, i'm made of compliance.'
[16:06:20] <jotham> sorry

[16:07:21] *** jotham changes topic to 'dispensation is still pensation.'
[16:07:49] <jotham> i never signed up to be your overlord
[16:08:27] <jotham> hopefully ERROH physicall breaks my dick
[16:08:30] <jotham> on film
[16:08:38] <jotham> and earns 3 points
[16:08:55] <jotham> which will hel his children
[16:09:16] <jotham> possibly they get to be educated in: yogurt
[16:09:37] <jotham> soviet yogurt uninion is strong
[16:10:18] *** jotham changes topic to 'we've never done some yogurt stuff, but we should'
[16:24:18] <Renderwww> talking about russian dairy products, how hard will sanctions hit the average russian when he can't buy smuggled finish cheese any longer?
[16:24:24] <Renderwww> https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8rk8ce/russians_smuggling_cheese_from_finland/
[16:26:27] <Crocodillian> illegal cheese is bst cheese
[16:29:06] <markuskj> foreign stuff was more for the rich people i think
[16:29:46] <Crocodillian> yeah don't forget that russia has a big population of millionaires and billionaires etc.
[16:29:52] <Crocodillian> and they could give a shit about the sanctions
[16:29:55] <Crocodillian> and they run the country
[16:30:10] <Renderwww> it's all fun and water games until they impound your yacht
[16:54:06] <Crocodillian> jotham: I'm wrong, brazillians and polish people have just as much right to create their own butchered dialect of english as anyone else

[22:58:28] <Zogatribe> who can remember being scared of the car wash as a kid?
[23:04:44] <Renderwww> did your parents have an invisible car? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lEEc8CC4rg&t=32s
[23:10:59] <Crocodillian> well I grew up in the Soviet Union and we didn't have car washes, not a lot of cars either
[23:12:02] <Crocodillian> cars were a mistake, watch the Adam Ruins Everything episode about that
[23:12:53] <Crocodillian> big cities shouldn't even have cars
[23:59:36] <hinst> The prehistoric trees made a mistake when they fossilized
