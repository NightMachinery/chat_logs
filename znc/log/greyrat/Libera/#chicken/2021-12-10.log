[12:33:05] <s-liao> and as well srfi-14 are talking about Latin-1 character set.
[12:33:52] <s-liao> if it has a way to display this kind of character.
[12:34:14] <Bunny351> have you tried the utf8 egg?
[12:37:06] <s-liao> Not yet.
[12:41:09] <s-liao> Yes. uft8 works
[12:41:43] <s-liao> (print ""  #\Â)
[12:43:45] <s-liao> Why is it?
[12:45:47] <sjamaan> s-liao: CHICKEN is a little bit schizofrenic about what a character really is. At some level we support UTF-8, but for the most part we treat characters as bytes, to avoid breaking code that reads from binary data streams
[12:45:54] <s-liao> You mean that for displaying , it is in utf8 egg. srfi-14 is just internal data representation for Latin-1 charater set?
[12:46:32] <sjamaan> The srfi-14 egg is legacy at this point and shouldn't be used. Use the utf8-srfi-14 module provided by the utf-8 egg, instead
[12:46:51] <sjamaan> The latin1 encoding is very uncommon nowadays
[12:49:00] <s-liao> sjamaan. Okay
[12:50:25] <sjamaan> The utf-8 egg patches some core procedures to make it work as if they supported utf-8 encoding natively (but it will break for binary data)
[12:56:56] <s-liao> What I know is that (eval #x9ec4)
[13:01:57] <s-liao> Some character can be displayed.

[14:42:42] <s-liao> So the srfi-14 got me confused, it got abandoned. is there any document has such information.
[14:44:34] <s-liao> We kind of need the relationship between srfi-14 to srfi- to show up what is the reason for it to get abandoned.
[14:44:53] <s-liao> Otherwise it got confused to the end user as well.
[14:48:16] <s-liao> srfi-14 can be worked by other srfi for other reason, I mean save as srfi-14. We can not remove it. It has other srfi reference to it.

[17:40:37] <jcowan> s-liao: SRFI 14 as a set of procedures is not legacy, but the srfi-14 egg is.
[17:43:59] <s-liao> Yes. As I looked up, at least srfi-14 is actively in chibi implementation.
[17:46:06] <s-liao> Okay. that means, from these a set of procedures in SRFI-14 is still actively in Chicken as well.
[17:46:35] <jcowan> Note the limitations there: the predefined sets aren't full Unicode, in line with Chibi's intention to keep things small.
[17:54:07] <s-liao> You mean that SRFI-14 as a design document for Unicode, in Chibi, it kept small as intersection sets , and chicken is like union set
[17:59:06] <sjamaan> utf8's version of srfi-14 is not legacy either
[18:13:01] <s-liao> What I understand is that SRFI-14 are different in the different scheme implementations. And it is a egg as well in term of portable Scheme code.
[18:14:40] <s-liao> different  means that different purpose as each of scheme implementations' need
