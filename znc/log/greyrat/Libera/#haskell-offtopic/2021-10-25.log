[22:10:12] <dminuoso> So I started to develop a theory. In some modern programming, especially web development, there seems to be a craving for having "best practices" when it comes to structuring code.
[22:10:35] *** Joins: eggplantade (~Eggplanta@2600:1700:bef1:5e10:a193:fe09:637c:a86c)
[22:10:40] <dminuoso> A lot of times, you see these projects with folder structures grouping things together by functionality. Say one folder for all models, one folder for all views, and so forth.
[22:11:00] <dminuoso> For so long I've been baffled by whoever came up with this being a good idea, since related code is rarely kept together. 
[22:11:37] <dminuoso> And Im starting to think, this is just an emergent behavior by people really not knowing how to structure code in the slightest - but this is a bootcamp teachable method, something you can convey.
[22:11:56] <dminuoso> Rather than say "practice and you get a feeling for how code should be structured"
[22:12:32] <monochrom> "best practice" = religion
[22:12:39] <dminuoso> Indeed.
[22:14:11] <dminuoso> It just seems unwise to structure code out of this religious rule "if its a model, put it into the models folder", because if you're working on some particular domain, say the shopping cart, chances are this is going to touch a couple of files. But now you have the hassle of finding related templates, views, models, controllers, routes, etc...
[22:14:41] <dminuoso> My only conclusion is "structuring code right is not teachable, but something you develop intuition over with practice"
[22:14:43] <monochrom> People are desperate for silver bullets and panaceas. They can't take "it depends" for an answer.  Perhaps "it depends" is too hard for them, and they shouldn't be in this career in the first place.

[22:15:48] <geekosaur> there's also that there's a lot of kids/young programmers involved and the industry tends to keep them that way because anyone with experience costs too much
[22:16:08] <geekosaur> so you never get any buildup of actual experience
[22:16:13] <dminuoso> monochrom: Google certainly wants a lot of these "silver bullet hungry" developers because it fits nicely into their "train someone out of high school with a fine set of rules printable on paper as fast as possible" - and you get a guaranteed coherence, at least developers will all share a similar structure.
[22:17:03] <geekosaur> (that said, the big three do jobhunt me and it's not very hard to learn I'm in my upper 50s)
[22:20:07] <__monty__> It's note exactly an easy problem though, and sometimes never-terrible is preferable to potentially-good. Similar to how code formatters don't tend to result in beautiful code but do tend to eliminate unreadably formatted code.
[22:20:34] <dminuoso> __monty__: Honestly, if you're producing unreadably formatted code, the chances of the code being structured horribly are big too.
[22:21:06] <dminuoso> It's indicative of being unable to communicate your intent. If you cant do that, the code itself will have the same problem. And your formatter cant address that
[22:22:23] <monochrom> __monty__, I don't oppose "if I can't think of a better organization, here is the default thing to do". That is not what I call a religion.
[22:22:39] <monochrom> A religion is "do this, no exception".
[22:23:02] <monochrom> A religion is "if you don't do this, next code review meeting will be a grill for you".
[22:23:10] <dminuoso> monochrom: Following just the default will not allow you to practice structuring styles though. It wont help improving.
[22:23:26] <dminuoso> Perhaps doing it wrong is better on that note, since it gives you room for experimentation.
[22:23:51] <dminuoso> Otherwise this default style is all you've ever known
[22:23:57] <monochrom> OK, s/a better/another/
[22:23:57] <dminuoso> And then it becomes a religion
[22:24:10] <dminuoso> Okay, fair.
[22:25:15] <monochrom> But there are a lot of questions that I know just one answer to, and it still has not become my religion.
[22:26:02] <monochrom> Because the dividing line is attitude. "if there is another answer, I'm curious" vs "I'm sure there is no other answer".
[22:26:27] <monochrom> or even, "if there is another answer, I'll attack it"
