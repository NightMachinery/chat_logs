[00:41:23] <pjb> skeemer__: not at all. He's Xah Lee, (not Xach).  Our Xach who wrote quicklisp is Zach Beane https://www.xach.com
[00:41:36] <skeemer__> ok thanks pjb
[00:41:49] <pjb> Preceeded by Arcsech ;-)
[00:42:38] <skeemer__> pjb, i was wondering if the  book "land of lisp" illustrates also how to do games with graphics
[00:43:32] <pjb> skeemer__: I've not read it, but the echoes I've had from it, don't reflet it as a very good CL book.  It seems to be full of personal idiosyncrasies.
[00:43:46] <pjb> skeemer__: better ask in #lispgames for state of the art graphics in games.
[00:43:56] <skeemer__> thanks pjb
[00:43:59] <pjb> skeemer__: I'd say the graphics situation in CL is complicated…
[00:45:45] <pjb> skeemer__: for student, toy projects, I'd propose pgl https://cliki.net/pgl  but there's a ton of options:  https://cliki.net/GUI
[00:46:04] <skeemer__> pjb, why do you say it is complicated?
[00:46:14] <skeemer__> there are no good ways to do graphics in it?
[00:46:35] <pjb> Because there's a lot of choices that will depend on your implementations and on the target platform, and on the application, and the portability level you want.
[00:46:55] <pjb> There are certain good ways to do graphics in CL.  It's a general problem.
[00:47:09] <skeemer__> pjb, i just care about linux
[00:47:13] <skeemer__> x86_64
[00:47:19] <pjb> For example, you could consider McCLIM as a "pure" CL option.
[00:47:42] <pjb> (therefore portable, but only where McCLIM backend exist).
[00:48:22] <pjb> On linux you could use plain X11, but it's a little raw. So often people will prefer to use some graphic/GUI library, but this means you will use it thru FFI.
[00:48:38] <pjb> (plain X11 has the advantage that you can talk to the X11 server using sockets directly from lisp).
[00:48:57] <pjb> Just browse that cliki page and see for yourself…
[00:49:25] <pjb> Let's say that in general you will have other constraints that will direct your choice.
[00:50:11] <pjb> So, apart from McCLIM, since the AI winter and the fall of the lisp machines, we haven't had any native lisp graphic system.
[00:51:02] <pjb> Even if eg. X11 was prototyped in lisp originally (hence the X11 keysym = key symbol represented as 29-bit integers (ie. fixnums with 3 tag bits!)).
[00:52:50] <pjb> For games, there are a lot of different games with different requirements for graphics. From 3D real-time fist-person shooters where you'd want to run stuff on the GPU, down to games like Hangman: https://cliki.net/com.informatimago.hangman where the graphical aspect is only a cherry on the cake, and could be implemented with any means.

[12:23:48] <beach> "The result of the discussion in the previous paragraph, means that unlike..."
[12:23:52] <beach> Or something like that.
[12:23:56] <lisp123> :) My english grammar is pretty bad, but I looking into the other day (unrelated to this topic). In relation to lisp, I chose to write (if (atom a) (list a) a) vs. (if (listp a) a (atom a)) for an expression that coerces an atom to a list
[12:24:18] <lisp123> ^ That makes sense to me
[12:24:29] <beach> lisp123: Those two expressions are not the same.
[12:24:44] <beach> An atom and a list are not mutually exclusive.
[12:24:47] <lisp123> sorry, typo in the second one
[12:25:03] <beach> NIL is the exception.  It is both an atom and a list.
[12:25:05] <lisp123> I guess NIL throws somes havoc
[12:25:19] <beach> CONSP is the opposite of ATOM.
[12:26:36] <beach> The thing with demonstrative pronouns without noun phrases is that often the author has not thought about what it is referring to, and as a result, it often does not refer to anything at all.
[12:26:37] <lisp123> Hmm, I guess I need (if (listp a) a (list a)) --> Although (if (and (atom a) (not (null a))) (list a) a) IMO reads better
[12:26:55] <beach> So it clears the thought process to always think of an appropriate noun phrase.
[12:27:22] <beach> lisp123: What is wrong with CONSP?
[12:27:45] <beach> Well, I guess it depends on what you want to do with NIL.
[12:27:58] <beach> So you want to leave NIL as it is?
[12:28:05] <lisp123> Yes, for NIL it should be treated as-is
[12:28:07] <beach> Then the first version is better.

[12:30:35] *** Quits: Qwnavery (~Qwnavery@user/qwnavery) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[12:30:45] <lisp123> Reason I was partial to (if (atom a..)) (before the case of NIL made it convoluted) was that it focused more on the operation --> IF ATOM, make it a list, otherwise keep it as-is" vs. When it is not a list, make it a list
[12:31:38] <lisp123> One could alternatively say "If a list, keep it as is, otherwise make it a list", but I felt the focal point of the expression was on the coercion from atom to list. This is all purely subjective thinking however
[12:32:18] <beach> But what you felt is incorrect because of NIL.
[12:32:46] <lisp123> Yes, but that's user error and no fault of grammar :)
[12:33:19] <lisp123> One could argue (if (and (atom a) (not (null a))) (list a) a) is a clearer version, although its too long
[12:35:16] <beach> Shinmera: "only invoke the restart under special conditions" -> "invoke the restart only under special conditions".  In writing, the first phrase reads "only INVOKE the restart [and not, say, REMOVE the restart] under special conditions" which is likely not what you want.
[12:35:42] <beach> In the spoken language, the distinction can be made with intonation.  Not so easy in writing.
[12:36:22] <beach> Shinmera: "error friendly", however, should probably be "error-friendly"
[12:37:09] <lisp123> beach: Do you have any good resources on technical writing? Your style is very good (similar to GLS in quality)
[12:37:37] <lisp123> I guess standard english grammar & style considerations apply, but wonder how you learnt it all
[12:38:44] <beach> lisp123: Not really.  I learned it the hard way by having my texts scrutinized by my (admittedly small) family.  She has a PhD in English and she was the only person to be promoted to "distinguished technical writer" at ILOG.  That said, Pinker's book "The sense of style" is a good start.
[12:39:46] <beach> Oh, and she was a copy editor in a past career too.
[12:40:51] <lisp123> Thanks, well it definitely shows (esp. in your age old article on formatting rules for Lisp, which I read a year ago at the start of learning Lisp). I will check out that book
[12:41:56] <beach> lisp123: It is really a matter of common sense in combination with re-reading your own texts carefully.  You want to make the text as unambiguous as possible, and you want to get the message across fast.  In technical writing, I mean.  Literature is different of course.

[12:45:04] <john-a-carroll> Regarding "well-designed", as a native English speaker I think the phrase "well-designed recovery points" is fine. "well-designed" is being used as an adjective, modifying "points" which is a noun

[12:47:04] <beach> john-a-carroll: The point of the exercise here is to avoid annoying referees.  I know this paper doesn't have that aspect to worry about, but I am giving general advice.  And if there are groups of people that get annoyed by a hyphen between an adverb and the verb, then it is best to avoid it.
[12:47:30] <beach> john-a-carroll: As opposed to "I think you should do this", I mean.

[16:46:15] *** Joins: selwynning (~selwyn@user/selwyn)
[16:46:50] <lisp123> You should try it out, it works well, although there are obviously some gotchas. (which even databases have)
[16:46:51] <pve> lisp123: great, can you tell me how you use it? Like, does it enable new kinds of workflows, for instance?
[16:47:57] *** Quits: abrantesasf (~abrantesa@187.36.170.211) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:48:05] <lisp123> I use it for persistent in memory data storage, _replacing_ databases. So I have a certain class. And I can create instances of that class and they automatically get added to the BKNR Data Store, which I can query because it automatically generates indexes for each slot (e.g. "class-with-slot-name")
[16:48:11] <lisp123> And also to export to XML
[16:48:23] <pve> I've never really tried any of the persistence solutions..
[16:49:31] <lisp123> Depends on what you are after. BKNR will be very fast because its in-memory (however it will need to load everything on startup, so if you refresh your image often, then factor that in)
[16:50:16] <lisp123> However, its "searching" capabilities are basically limited to hash table looksup, again very fast, but not as detailed as an SQL database. Also SQL has all the other stuff going for it - normalisations etc, so really depends on your data structure
[16:50:29] <pve> lisp123: For something like AllegroCache I can immediately see the value it brings, but for an in-memory solution it's less clear to me how it should be used
[16:51:00] <lisp123> What does AllegroCache do?

[16:52:03] <lisp123> I'm no expert, but if you are primarily dealing with one set of class objects, e.g. books in a bookstore, or theorems in a maths book, or cars in a garage, then BKNR works well because its mapped directly to your class structure
[16:52:47] <lisp123> If you need to work across tables and link them with keys and that sort of stuff, then SQL is probably better
[16:52:58] <pve> lisp123: It's another object persistence solution which stores instances transparently on disk (unless I'm very mistaken)
[16:54:07] <lisp123> In general, you can't go wrong with SQLite or Postmodern. And maybe after looking at it from that perspective, consider BKNR or an alternative
