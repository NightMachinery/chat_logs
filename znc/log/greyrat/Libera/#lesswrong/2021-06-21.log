[00:09:50] <nshepperd> yes that's absolutely a horrible idea
[00:09:56] <saturn2> yep

[00:14:20] <shawwwn> That‚Äôs fucking hilarious. Did people start calling freenode ‚Äúrasenstan‚Äù?
[00:14:47] <dbohdan> I think it's "stan" as in "fanboy"
[00:14:52] <mst> dbohdan: yes
[00:15:08] <mst> and I've not heard it used before, I in fact made it up as I ws typing my sentence to wrycode

[00:15:21] <mst> we've mostly been calling it leenode
[00:16:02] <shawwwn> I think the -Stan as a place is so funny I lost my mind
[00:16:09] <shawwwn> There it goes, it went over there
[00:16:29] <dbohdan> mst: It's a pretty good coinage
[00:16:34] <shawwwn> Because it clearly captures how freenode turned out
[00:17:13] <wrycode> fair enough, it just blows my mind sometimes when people think that they aren't somewhat extreme/radical and then that people with basically majority viewpoints are the extreme ones
[00:17:13] <shawwwn> Leenode almost sounds cool
[00:17:38] <shawwwn> rasenstan perfectly articulates the dystopia
[00:18:04] <saturn2> mst: they actually are SJWs though. they've gone through half a dozen freak-outs about this or that random thing being racist during the time i've been there

[00:19:53] <wrycode> I didn't think saturn2 was referring to you two 
[00:20:02] <saturn2> right, but that doesn't make the preexisting battle over whether cancel culture exists go away
[00:20:19] <mst> wrycode: when I said "dude alternates between claiming everything is SJWs" I was talking about the clown prince's claims about his detractors
[00:20:35] <nshepperd> if they're actually SJWs then the theory that the only issue that they had with wrycode was the association with leenode seems unlikely
[00:20:42] <mst> wrycode: my point was that ##freenode was nothing to do with the sentence in which I said 'SJWs'
[00:20:45] <wrycode> mst: I/we understood, I think
[00:20:57] <shawwwn> mst: oh dear, you‚Äôre an SJW? I had no idea
[00:21:00] <wrycode> I understood at least
[00:21:01] <mst> wrycode: so I never thought saturn2 was referring to we too and I don't know why you said that
[00:21:15] <mst> if you understood, that 'correction' wasn't required?
[00:21:39] <mst> shawwwn: the clown prince is a li'l bit on the hypersensitive side about disagreement
[00:21:46] <wrycode> mst: oh I'm so dumb, I get it now
[00:22:29] <saturn2> my point was that while they may have pattern-matched you to a rasen-stan, they may also just have pattern-matched you to a right-winger
[00:23:24] <mst> saturn2: this is a fair point, though I suspect that channel's groupthink is such that they don't get many people talking who're the latter who aren't also the former

[00:25:13] <wrycode> they said the whole discussion was off-topic, which might be true and fair but I just thought it was funny how quickly I was silenced for simply disagreeing that cancel culture doesn't exist
[00:25:46] <feep> shawwwn: I think everyone agrees that the thing that is currently happening with closed models isn't science, that they're just doing it to productivize instead of genuine safety concerns, and that keeping models closed contributes to the downfall of ml as a field
[00:25:58] <wrycode> mst: I was driven away from #archlinux-offtopic by that effect 
[00:26:16] <feep> the AI safety people will just be like "... so you're saying we're getting everything we've been hoping for for free? Thanks neoliberalism!"
[00:26:30] <feep> like
[00:26:44] <feep> current models are not dangerous
[00:27:04] <mst> wrycode: doesn't surprise me
[00:27:13] <feep> but inasmuch as we can model progress in the field as an *incremental* process, it's not like ... only the last improvement step would be the dangerous one, right?
[00:27:21] <feep> every one before that is equally worth opposing.
[00:27:33] <mst> wrycode: then again my main involvement with the arch community was teaching them better moderation because they had some knobhead who kept joining channels and then privmsging anybody he guessed was female to hit on them
[00:27:35] <feep> at least, if your goal is to delay that last dangerous step at all costs.
[00:28:25] <mst> so if the people in -offtopic were overly cranky about perceived infractions against SJWism, well, they did also deal with some serious bullshit
[00:28:39] <wrycode> mst: that's so bad lol
[00:29:16] <feep> also I did a 17km escooter round tour
[00:29:16] <mst> wrycode: and then when they said "no" he'd send 'WHORE' or 'SLUT' over and over and over again

[00:30:22] <wrycode> the line that made me quit was when someone posted a picture of their dog, and the dog had pointy ears, and this one guy started speculating about animal cruelty and whether the dog's ears had been cut. You couldn't talk about ANY topic without this guy making it about his politics 
[00:30:32] <mst> oh JFC
[00:30:35] <mst> yeah
[00:30:50] <mst> I much prefer being a dude on the internet, I mostly only get people telling me to kill myself or calling me a faggot
[00:30:58] <mst> occasionally some idiot talks about muslims raping my mother
[00:31:05] <wrycode> mst: I had "lindsey" as my hostname for a while and I would get unsolicited IRC messages, it took me like two weeks to figure out why
[00:31:15] <mst> but asking them why they're friends with so many necrophiliacs screws them up nicely in that case
[00:32:14] <wrycode> male-male trash talk is oddly comforting compared to male-female shaming
[00:33:17] <nshepperd> i think EY is right. many ai safety opponents don't see this as real life. they think of ai apocalypse like it's a movie "oh yeah that would be bad i guess, (but we'll be able to go home afterwards so it's not a big deal really)"
[00:34:44] <feep> yep

[02:14:46] <gwern> ...create automatic link rewrites: pairs of regexps/URLs, to feed into a Pandoc pass: check if any URL is present in a page, disable that regexp if it is; combine them all into a single giant regexp for efficiency; check each String if it matches, and if it does, run through the individual regexps; rewrite into a Link using the corresponding URL; then mark the URL 'used' and if it matches...
[02:14:52] <gwern> ...again, skip it.

[03:55:15] <spxtr> I mean, I'm seeing lots of results saying microwaved water tastes worse (generally for nonsense reasons), some saying it tastes the same, and very few saying it tastes slightly better.
[03:55:51] <kuudes> .wp lady tasting tea
[03:56:06] <kuudes> oh, feepbot is still in bot heaven
[03:56:19] <kuudes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea
[03:56:20] <Robomot> Lady tasting tea - Wikipedia (In the design of experiments in statistics, the lady tasting tea is a randomized experiment devised by Ronald Fisher and reported in his book The Design of Experiments (1935).[1] The experiment is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a null hypothesis, which is "never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation".[2][3] ‚Ä¶)
[03:57:28] <gwern> that's milk, yes, but I mentioned her as an example of how apparently irrelevant prep differences do seem to be able to make substantial taste differences
[03:58:17] <kuudes> yeah, it was milk-tea order
[03:58:31] <kuudes> I guess similar could be done for microwave vs boiling
[03:59:57] <kuudes> there was that parkinson smeller who smelt correctly parkinson disease patients shirts from other same characteristic people shirts, though identified one of the control group as parkinson's but that person, when they run him through doctors, was found to have a parkinson starting
[04:01:40] <spxtr> gwern: most of the reasons I've seen on google for why microwaved water should be worse are physically nonsense.
[04:02:13] <spxtr> "When water is boiled on the stove the water boils evenly and all of it boils. In the microwave the water only boils where the microwaves have hit it so you can have cold spots throughout the water. These hot and cold spots are also what causes the water to bubble up and foam over sometimes when you add your instant coffee." that's nonsense, and yet I've seen it repeated multiple times
[04:02:47] <spxtr> "But microwaves don‚Äôt heat water evenly, so the boiling process is difficult to control. Microwave ovens shoot tiny waves into the liquid at random locations, causing the water molecules at those points to vibrate rapidly. If the water isn‚Äôt heated for long enough, the result is isolated pockets of very hot or boiling water amid a larger body of water that‚Äôs cooler." complete nonsense
[04:03:08] <gwern> spxtr: I'm not aware that the milk/tea thing has been solved either
[04:03:57] <kuudes> https://what-if.xkcd.com/131/
[04:04:03] <Robomot> Microwaves
[04:05:35] <spxtr> kuudes: that's true for solid food, but not for water
[04:06:43] <kuudes> well the standing wave thing still is true
[04:07:26] <spxtr> sure, but it's not important for 2 reasons: 1. the platter rotates, and 2. water develops convection currents that even out the temperature throughout
[04:07:48] <kuudes> yes, I presume it would even out quite fast at least if one stirs it
[04:07:54] <saturn2> maybe the difference is actually between a glass cup versus metal teapot
[04:08:03] <spxtr> boiling water stirs itself very effectively what with all those big bubbles
[04:08:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ceramic mugs or gtfo imo
[04:08:54] <spxtr> saturn2: it's possible that built-up scale in the metal kettle affects the taste, that's usually considered bad though
[04:09:03] <kuudes> I have been wanting a microwave gun, sort of similar as a hairdryer
[04:09:13] <kuudes> but I presume that would be generally too dangerous for public use etc

[04:10:40] <kuudes> or crafting
[04:10:59] <kuudes> you could melt or heat part of clay etc

[04:15:24] <kuudes> I have also some times considered if one could cast metal with a microwave - it could maybe doable with at leat silver
[04:15:36] <saturn2> yes, some hobbyists do that
[04:15:39] <kuudes> you would have to make a mold out of clay or something so that it would warm
[04:15:47] <Betawolf> "baking and melting steel"
[04:16:00] <saturn2> you can use an unmodified microwave, you don't have to turn it into a gun
[04:16:25] <kuudes> well, sure, but the microwave faraday cage is not very large
[04:16:44] <Betawolf> hard to fit your enemies inside
[04:17:14] <kuudes> one thing I am also missing is that we still don't have in our phones that 3d imaging with wlan/gsm/3g/radio
[04:17:31] <kuudes> I would like to look behind walls and inside things
[04:17:52] <kuudes> and it is not even dangerous because it only uses rays that are already available from the phone
[04:19:26] <kuudes> hmm. could one do effects by throwing some dust in air and then microwaving it with a pulse so that it would catch fire?
