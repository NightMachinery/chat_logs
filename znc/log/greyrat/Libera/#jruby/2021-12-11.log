[17:48:36] <ahorek[m]> any hints how to find bottlenecks in Rails? yjit really seems to improve perf, but both jruby & truffleruby are significantelly (8 times) slower and indy makes it even worse. I'm using visualvm, is there a better alternative?

[18:51:24] <klobuczek[m]> Is the support for calling protected and default access java methods still on the table or given up?
