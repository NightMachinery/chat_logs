[01:27:18] <Gres11> Hi, I'm trying to write a regex to capture all elements of a string group, in which elements with blanks are enclosed with double quotes, and other are not. So far the quoted match works, but without quotes not :/
[01:27:20] <Gres11> https://regex101.com/r/Nb1n7L/1
[01:28:00] <Gres11> Ideally, the quotes wouldn't be included in the resulting matches.
[01:32:18] <Blondie101010> Gres11:  I don't understand how you plan to delimit what you need if there's no quote
[01:34:07] <Blondie101010> perhaps you're looking to delimit based on [\b",] ?
[01:34:37] <Blondie101010> actually that includes overlap
[01:35:47] <Blondie101010> supporting the "\"" is an awkward regex requirement
[01:35:48] <Gres11> Blondie101010: Idea is to match everything within quotes, separated by commas (excluding escaped quotes), or without quotes.
[01:36:15] <Blondie101010> what is the delimiter if there's no quote?
[01:36:27] <Blondie101010> you start off saying you split on quotes and then say you don't
[01:36:35] <Blondie101010> you need to define that rule clearly
[01:36:37] <Gres11> Indeed, it's mitigating an implementation of how the DB handles strings -_-

[01:37:17] <Gres11> Comma is the delimiter..
[01:37:20] <Blondie101010> regex is probably the hardest way to parse that line
[01:37:26] <Blondie101010> because of the \"
[01:37:38] <Gres11> What would be a better approach in your opinion?
[01:38:08] <Blondie101010> well considering you mentioned "DB" I find it concerning
[01:38:25] <Blondie101010> why would you need \" inside a query if you're using prepared statements?
[01:38:50] <Gres11> It's not the query, it's the result of a query.
[01:38:59] <Blondie101010> ok
[01:39:01] <Gres11> *handles strings in arrays.
[01:39:53] <Blondie101010> so lets start by extracting what you want, so basically anything separated by ^, ", and $

[01:43:16] <Blondie101010> if I remember correctly, the format you have is the csv format used by Python by default
[01:43:35] <Gres11> CSV would not handle comma in a quoted member of the list scenario.
[01:43:41] <Blondie101010> of course
[01:44:09] <Blondie101010> you could test it with your favorite spreadsheet software, but it'll probably use the MS syntax

[05:30:08] <Me-me> Is this PCRE?
[05:30:11] <jargon> Yes.
[05:30:45] <Me-me> You'll probably want \h in place of \s there then. Minor thing, but it prevents you accidentally matching X blank lines, when it seems like you want to keep this on one line.
[05:31:08] <Me-me> Or even just literal spaces.
[05:31:09] <jargon> Yes. How does \h work?
[05:31:40] <jargon> Each match covers two lines of subject
[05:31:44] <Me-me> It's the same as \s except without newlines or other new line characters.
[05:31:58] <Me-me> Also, the reason it isn't matching is because you're missing the \" on the other side of the brackets.

[05:32:32] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/m4ZiHb/3 Another option.

[14:57:21] <re101-wolf-54> cool, it works. will the same expression work in python re module or I have to add something?

[16:57:20] <digitok> i think that's still legal, yes

[16:58:08] <VectorX> so odd, I have never thought of doing so before
[16:58:13] <Blondie101010> :)
[16:59:08] <InformaticaEduca> haha
[16:59:42] <InformaticaEduca> Ok I will try to do it in English. I am a teacher from Argentina
[17:00:52] <InformaticaEduca> I need to validate the data that the studens enter in a Google Form
[17:01:41] <InformaticaEduca> in order to limit the options to the following string
[17:02:02] <InformaticaEduca> the letter d and the ID number
[17:02:40] <InformaticaEduca> The letter must be case sensitive, and the numbers must be 8 digits
[17:03:03] <InformaticaEduca> I tried with this ^[^d0-9]{1}$ but it does not work
[17:03:27] <InformaticaEduca> Sorry for my bad English
[17:03:38] <VectorX> InformaticaEduca you can add some example items on https://regex101.com/ with what should match and what should not so we can get an idea
[17:03:51] <VectorX> save the regex top right and paste the link here
[17:04:01] <VectorX> sorry I mean top left
[17:04:52] <InformaticaEduca> Thanks ! How can I add example items?
[17:05:09] <Blondie101010> in the test box, preferably line by line
[17:05:17] <InformaticaEduca> Because I have to limit de numbers of digits and the order of the elements
[17:05:42] <InformaticaEduca> the letter must be first and then the numbers without spaces or dots
[17:06:00] <Blondie101010> your regex does not match that intention
[17:06:30] <VectorX> InformaticaEduca ^d\d{8}$
[17:07:20] <InformaticaEduca> Tha expression allows numbers? Thank you +VectorX and Blondie101010
[17:07:58] <VectorX> InformaticaEduca it is the same as ^d[0-9]{8}$ but you can use that too if the other doesnt work for some reason
[17:08:10] <VectorX> \d = [0-9]
[17:08:41] <InformaticaEduca> Great
[17:09:06] <InformaticaEduca> So ther is no way to determine the order of the elements, right?
[17:10:01] <VectorX> that does what you asked for, string/id starting with the lowercase letter 'd' with 8 numbers that follow
[17:10:17] <InformaticaEduca> Yes, you are right
[17:10:30] <VectorX> ^ start of string, $ end of string, so that would be exactly 9 characters inbetween
[17:10:32] <InformaticaEduca> I am using the text box and it is ok
[17:11:54] <InformaticaEduca> You were very nice with me
[17:14:57] <VectorX> InformaticaEduca thank you, by the way, I think your english is fine
[17:15:06] <InformaticaEduca> :)
[17:15:13] <digitok> indeed

[18:01:14] <Lope> I don't need to deal with billions.
