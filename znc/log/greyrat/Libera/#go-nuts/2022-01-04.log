[02:47:38] <fizzie> Shouldn't be anything wrong with that. But the commit adding walk.go is not yet in the most recent stable version tag (v5.3.1), which is the version you'd get by default.

[08:50:02] <allhailjarjar> https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/83fSLYGg5-f
[08:50:25] <allhailjarjar> How would I return a generic type then? Because I can only initialize a concrete type

[08:54:53] <rewt> Go is still a strictly typed language; your 2nd error says "cannot infer T" which means that T can have multiple possibilities, and it cannot infer which one it would be at that point... constructors still need to return concrete types
[09:01:57] <allhailjarjar> That part makes sense. How the constructor needs the concrete type.
[09:01:57] <allhailjarjar> What I don't quite understand is why I can't set   a variable of type  [T Moo]  equal to a variable of type [T Foo]   when Moo is defined as a constraint which includes the  Foo type

[09:03:22] <foobaz> maybe you need to do d = funky[T]()
[09:04:30] <allhailjarjar> same error
[09:04:38] <allhailjarjar> "cannot use funky[T]() (value of type *Duck[Foo]) as type *Duck[T] in assignment"
[09:04:46] <rewt> read that error message
[09:05:07] <allhailjarjar> Yes, I see that I can't do that. I'm asking why
[09:05:07] <rewt> you're trying to assign to a *Duck[T], where T can be one of multiple possibilities
[09:05:19] <foobaz> this is the best i can do: https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/kNa3TUVc8ex
[09:05:21] <rewt> *Duck[Foo] is just one of those
[09:05:22] <allhailjarjar> But T is a superset of Foo according to the constrait
[09:05:39] *** bpalmer` is now known as bpalmer
[09:05:41] <rewt> exactly; it's a superset, but dunky() is for ALL Ts
[09:06:55] <allhailjarjar> that's exactly my point. It's for ALL Ts, and Foo is one of those All Ts. So why can't I use Foo as a T?
[09:07:10] <allhailjarjar> I'm not understanding some key concept here :|
[09:07:17] <rewt> because it could also bee a Bar, which is not a Foo
[09:07:20] <foobaz> it works if i remove Bar from Moo: https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/sMEGc55cLQq
[09:07:49] <foobaz> but with Bar, no dice: https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/58_YbVkeRmI
[09:08:01] <rewt> you could just remove MyField from the constructor (having it get the zero value)
[09:08:15] <allhailjarjar> >because it could also bee a Bar, which is not a Foo      why isn't  that an issue with interfaces in Go? Why no concept of polymorphism here? Very confusing
[09:08:18] <rewt> https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/sSsGWbAInp2
[09:10:19] <foobaz> is the problem the | in the Moo interface? maybe that doesn't mean "or" like we think
[09:10:35] <foobaz> i don't see any docs for that syntax in https://go.dev/ref/spec#Interface_types
[09:11:10] <foobaz> oh, i need the tip version, https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Interface_types
[09:11:15] <ikke> |   alternation
[09:13:10] <rewt> it's because the argument to dunk() can be either *Duck[Foo] or *Duck[Bar], and the return value must be the same; if you pass in a Bar, and set it to a Foo and return that, they're not the same
[09:13:48] <rewt> this makes that a bit clearer: https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/eJyAle7vMeP
[09:14:32] <foobaz> oh, that makes sense
[09:15:19] <allhailjarjar> That makes sense now
[09:15:55] <allhailjarjar> Thank you both
[09:16:03] <rewt> without initializing MyField, there is no error because it can still be either one: https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/sSsGWbAInp2
[09:16:47] <allhailjarjar> hmm, that raises another question then. What's the default value of "MyField" if we haven't specified a type for it?
[09:16:56] <rewt> it's the zero-value of T
[09:17:02] <b0nn> And https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/ee3PvFNHAka
[09:17:28] <rewt> %#v to have it show types as well
[09:17:37] <allhailjarjar> So what would the zero-value of Moo be in this case? I mean they're both numeric types so 0, but what if one was a struct, and the other a number?
[09:18:05] <allhailjarjar> slices of numeric types is what I meant to say
[09:18:42] <rewt> zero-values of slices are nil (edit b0nn's link to have %#v instead of %v in the printf)
[09:19:09] <allhailjarjar> Ahh it gets disambiguated when we specify the type in the function call
[09:19:41] <rewt> (and nils in go still have a type)
[09:20:59] <b0nn> What little I know of Go's generics is that what's happening is that your code is effectively a template, and when it's called the type that you call it with means that your code is created for that type
[09:21:12] <b0nn> if that makes sense
[09:21:55] <b0nn> If i make a generic print(T) then somewhere call it with an int, the compiler genertes a ptinr(int) function
[09:22:11] <b0nn> sometimes, though, the compiler spells it properly

[09:28:19] <ikke> You mean no new types in generic methods?
[09:28:52] <A_Dragon> yeah
[09:29:04] <KirkMcDonald> Same reason you can't have virtual template member functions in C++, I imagine.
[09:29:31] <A_Dragon> because its really easy to say "this would be nice" but its really complex to do and even more complex to do quickly?
[09:29:39] <KirkMcDonald> Or if not the *same* reason, then a similar one.
[09:29:56] <foobaz> yea, it works the same as C++ or java, just differently confusing error messages
[09:30:28] <KirkMcDonald> In C++ it's because the layout of the vtable has to be known statically.
[09:30:49] <A_Dragon> IIRC the current go reason is "if you want it we'll add it later

[19:38:00] <j416> it's broken? o_O hoq?
[19:38:04] <j416> how?*
[19:38:45] <j416> Effective Go is a good read, and the language spec
[19:39:31] <lovev> I got "example.com/greetings" is a program, not an importable package" and when I googled it, came to here https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44457 which ended saying the tutorial is broken wrt modules
[19:40:18] <lovev> Effective Go and the spec, yes okay

[19:55:34] <j416> what tutorial is that, then?
[19:55:47] <albertito> tar_xvf: you can use mime/multipart (from stdlib) to create an email with an attachment, but it's cumbersome and difficult if you don't know a lot about multipart emails
