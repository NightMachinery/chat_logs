[00:49:28] <Nanobot> Water or a sports drink

[00:50:23] <Urchin[emacs]> maybe that's just branding
[00:50:48] <Nanobot> Besides, her lack of a sports bra must really limit the types of physical activities she can do at the gym.

[01:05:33] <Bco1981> hm, but you still need the tpm 1.2 atleast
[01:05:49] <Jigsy> I've heard that Windows 11 won't let you update if you have an old processor.
[01:05:56] <Jigsy> Which is great news for people who hate forced reboot shit.
[01:06:45] <Bco1981> yes, if you have a old cpu the 11 won't be available as a update. but you can still install from a iso
[01:06:57] <Bco1981> if you atleast have tpm 1.2
[01:08:32] <Jigsy> Though anyone with a brain would just jump ship to Linux at this point.

[05:02:33] <ButterNoodle> u know 300aac is the civilized 7.62x39 right
[05:02:36] <MootPoot> is it
[05:02:40] <ButterNoodle> yea
[05:02:56] <MootPoot> idk, I'll stick to my bulk chinese surplus 7.62x39 
[05:02:59] <MootPoot> 28c a round
[05:03:00] <MootPoot> lmao
[05:03:03] <ButterNoodle> tru
[05:03:04] <MootPoot> boom boom all day
[05:03:09] <ButterNoodle> didnt say it was cheap
[05:03:15] <ButterNoodle> its just as much as 308
[05:03:38] <MootPoot> I wonder why they never made a uber rimfire
[05:03:44] <ButterNoodle> ?
[05:03:58] <MootPoot> we stopped using rimjob rounds due to pressure limits right
[05:04:28] <ButterNoodle> naa pita for consistent combustion from rimfire
[05:04:32] <MootPoot> why cant we just like, design an action that completely seals the round from the back, or swap to like steel or something
[05:04:43] <MootPoot> steel rimfire
[05:04:56] <ButterNoodle> typical saami limits are 60K psi
[05:04:59] <ButterNoodle> for everything
[05:05:05] <ButterNoodle> unless its belted magnum
[05:05:18] <MootPoot> hmm....idk, aside from some winchester rebranded bulk box 22s, my rimfires go phut ever time
[05:05:22] <MootPoot> every*
[05:06:01] <ButterNoodle> next time u hear an idiot talking about reloading rimfire.. ask how many duds they had
[05:06:15] <MootPoot> there was a dude who made a rimfire reloading kit lol
[05:06:20] <MootPoot> I remember watching a video about it
[05:06:23] <MootPoot> was selling it too
[05:06:29] <ButterNoodle> literally snake oil
[05:06:40] <MootPoot> I was really into the idea of getting a 17 hmr or a 22wmr rimjob gun
[05:06:51] <MootPoot> but for the price, might as well do a 9mm carbine
[05:06:56] <MootPoot> 30-40c a round
[05:06:59] <ButterNoodle> yea
[05:07:11] <MootPoot> although they arent even as close to as accurate
[05:07:11] <ButterNoodle> that would be best option.. we'll never run out of 9mm
[05:07:13] <MootPoot> but still
[05:07:36] <MootPoot> data on 9mm accuracy or 9mm accurizing out to like 100-200m is really hard to come across
[05:08:05] <ButterNoodle> long barrel
[05:08:21] <ButterNoodle> play with bullet weights and charge level
[05:08:35] <MootPoot> lmao , 9mm sabot / subcaliber
[05:08:39] <MootPoot> the memes from that
[05:08:43] <ButterNoodle> :/
[05:08:47] <ButterNoodle> 400 corbon
[05:08:53] <ButterNoodle> or 357sig
[05:09:03] <MootPoot> needs to be pointy
[05:09:36] <ButterNoodle> well 9mm is the pointiest
[05:09:49] <ButterNoodle> 57..
[05:10:04] <MootPoot> I guess, if they mass produced 5.7
[05:10:10] <MootPoot> pointy round
[05:10:15] <ButterNoodle> the same for any other strange shit
[05:10:17] <MootPoot> but with those prices
[05:10:22] <ButterNoodle> 9mm cheap
[05:11:13] <MootPoot> you know what, i just remembered
[05:11:21] <MootPoot> I need to finish my trash gun accurizing project
[05:11:29] <MootPoot> old sweedish mauser that needs a new stock
[05:13:45] <MootPoot> its rough af, but it shoots 30-06
[05:14:04] <MootPoot> I think with some messing around I could make it into like a 1.5moa banger at least
[05:14:07] <MootPoot> maybe 2
[05:14:19] <MootPoot> hurts to shoot too much with it tho
[05:14:24] <ButterNoodle> how long?
[05:14:26] <ButterNoodle> pusi...
[05:15:04] <MootPoot> I got a rubber ass condom for it
[05:15:11] <MootPoot> so it should be okay now; but that being said
[05:15:17] <MootPoot> I think about 10rds or so
[05:15:46] <MootPoot> it was with the old wood stock with no padding or smooth back
[05:15:47] <ButterNoodle> I miss my pre-64 model 70
[05:15:55] <ButterNoodle> it was in 30-06
[05:16:36] <MootPoot> yeah, that's the only large caliber gun I have
[05:16:39] <MootPoot> with real power
[05:17:04] <MootPoot> I mean I guess I COULD just be like fuck it and get a savage axis or somthing but that's boring
[05:17:05] <ButterNoodle> idk what the larges I have.. I mean 54r is pretty hot
[05:17:11] <MootPoot> oh yeah
[05:17:16] <MootPoot> I have 54r as well
[05:17:24] <MootPoot> shoots high and right, but is fairly consisent
[05:17:27] <MootPoot> some rust and petting
[05:17:31] <MootPoot> pitting
[05:17:31] <ButterNoodle> that steel core shit is not to be fucked with
[05:17:37] <MootPoot> eh
[05:17:48] <MootPoot> I've shot it at steel plate , 300m
[05:17:51] <MootPoot> no dents
[05:17:53] <ButterNoodle> 45/70 is pretty lit.. I just dont want to feed that thing
[05:18:27] <MootPoot> I wonder if there are aftermarket irons for a mosin
[05:18:35] <MootPoot> dont want to bother with optics

[07:23:58] <amigojapan> Good morning
[07:28:05] <MootPoot> Rip
[07:29:20] <MootPoot> Might need to OD on melatonin or something
[07:29:29] <klaxa> what are you coding on?
[07:29:33] <klaxa> or prefer not to share? :P
[07:29:46] <MootPoot> I code on my computer
[07:29:54] <MootPoot> ¬∂:
[07:29:59] <klaxa> ah
[07:30:09] <klaxa> like a true professional
[07:30:20] <MootPoot> I used to code on my pet cat 
[07:30:37] <MootPoot> Jokes aside I'm just fucking around with some new crap 
[07:30:48] <MootPoot> .NET Blazor 
[07:31:18] * MootPoot puts .NET on amigojapans computer
[07:31:21] <MootPoot> Hehe
[07:32:08] <klaxa> >.net in html
[07:32:35] * MootPoot shrugs 
[07:32:39] <MootPoot> It works and it's cool 
[07:32:42] <klaxa> microsoft is already maintaining typescript
[07:33:18] <MootPoot> I don't like interpreted languages 
[07:33:29] <klaxa> neither do i
[07:33:34] <klaxa> that's why i don't do web stuff
[07:33:39] <klaxa> html is very much interpreted
[07:33:44] <MootPoot> I'd much rather just do it all in .NET and have it spit out all the html and crap for me 
[07:34:02] <MootPoot> You don't really do much if any html when using Blazor 
[07:34:26] <MootPoot> Most of your time is just spent in the backend 
[07:34:38] <MootPoot> But my websites look like shit anyway so what do I know 
[07:36:02] <klaxa> isn't this just compiling c# to javascript?
[07:36:12] <klaxa> you are just adding more code to be interpreted :^)

[07:36:58] <MootPoot> is it?
[07:37:02] <MootPoot> idfk 
[07:37:11] <MootPoot> as long as I dont have to write JS myself, I dont really care
[07:38:24] <MootPoot> nobody in their right mind should have to write JS
[07:38:29] <MootPoot> or PHP for that matter
[07:38:36] * MootPoot shudders
[07:39:30] <klaxa> i mean how else would it run in a browser?
[07:39:35] <klaxa> they don't ship native .net
[07:39:42] <MootPoot> dont think about it
[07:39:53] <MootPoot> if you think about it you'll have to think about JS
[07:40:39] <klaxa> yeah it compiles to wasm
[07:41:16] <klaxa> meh, i prefer to use the right tool for the right job
[07:41:30] <MootPoot> This is the right tool
[07:41:39] <klaxa> i guess
[07:41:46] <klaxa> otherwise ms wouldn't be making it
[07:41:47] <MootPoot> if all you want to do is static pages or simple ones sure, I get it
[07:42:06] <emmeka> idk how to NEET, help. it's a weekday and I haven't done anything. now my house is clean and I have run out of things to occupy my time.
[07:42:08] <MootPoot> but it starts really coming in handy when you have a lot of data being pushed foreward and back
[07:42:33] <MootPoot> emmeka: go lie in bed and have a internal crisis
[07:42:45] <emmeka> I even did the decidedly un-NEET thing, on this first day of NEETdom, of updating my resume and applying to a few places
[07:42:51] <emmeka> clearly I'm bad at this
[07:42:52] <MootPoot> meh
[07:44:31] <MootPoot> klaxa:  for like website internal config pages, or sites that are utilities ( say idk, online image resizer or some crap like that ) its much easier to just tap into the shit ton of libraries that .NET already has
[07:44:56] <MootPoot> rather then dealing with all the bullshit about sending the photo over yourself, and back 
[07:45:55] <klaxa> good point, i would agree that .net has a better standard library and better standards in their libraries
[07:46:57] <MootPoot> and the direct type compatibility .NET  has with MS SQL server, or just using a ORM library
[07:47:11] <MootPoot> but anyway, it reduces the crap you have to do significantly
[07:49:03] <klaxa> by adding more abstraction, as it should it :^)
[07:49:38] <MootPoot> It does, but you know the most expensive resoruce in most dev projects is developer time
[07:49:43] <MootPoot> rather then hardware to run it
[07:49:44] <klaxa> i've never really been into webdevelopment tbh
[07:50:02] <klaxa> i've made simple SPA for myself but that's about it
[07:50:15] <MootPoot> a few bucks more on hosting vs spending thousands extra for an extra week or two of making features from scratch that already exist
[07:50:52] <MootPoot> Some would say it is computationally inefficient, and I agree
[07:51:05] <MootPoot> but theres more kinds of efficient in a project then technically

[13:54:32] <darkpeach> Chanel!
[13:54:46] <amigojapan> Emmanuel_Chanel: you are Japanese right?
[13:54:51] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Yes.
[13:54:58] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Haven't I said that before?
[13:55:27] <amigojapan> Ah ok. It is rare to have Japanese people here Emmanuel_Chanel 
[13:55:35] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Oh, yeah.
[13:56:18] <darkpeach> hmm, Chanel has no fragrance called Emmanuel
[13:56:36] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Emmanuel_Chanel is just a handle and not my real name.
[13:57:16] <Emmanuel_Chanel> On the net, the handle works as the identification much more than my real name, though.
[13:57:21] <darkpeach> just like darkpeach is not my real name
[13:57:46] <amigojapan> Emmanuel_Chanel: the user called gennji is also Japanese. But it seems he got stuck in coming here from freenode
[13:57:50] <Emmanuel_Chanel> My real name is too usual as a Japanese man. And it would be very hard for people to recognize me.

[14:00:12] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Right. It's risky.
[14:00:19] <amigojapan> Right
[14:01:18] <DunceCotus> risky but sexy
[14:01:36] <amigojapan> Emmanuel_Chanel: are you a fan of isekai anime?
[14:02:07] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Well, I don't watch so many isekai anime. But certainly, I like them.
[14:02:13] <amigojapan> I saw one of the animes you like says "tensei"
[14:02:23] <darkpeach> satou shouta?
[14:02:34] <Emmanuel_Chanel> ???
[14:02:51] <analoq> amigojapan: i figured my wine problem out
[14:02:56] <amigojapan> Emmanuel_Chanel: at first I did not like isekai, but recently I watched some good ones
[14:03:12] <Emmanuel_Chanel> amigojapan: The other way, have you got the COVID-19 vaccine shots?
[14:03:15] <amigojapan> What was it analoq ?
[14:03:33] <analoq> turns out wine isn't a sandbox at all. it makes the whole '/' available inside the container. and then maps various windows folders to dedicated /home/user/folders
[14:03:42] <amigojapan> I did Emmanuel_Chanel 3 weeks ago I got my second shot
[14:03:43] <analoq> the savegame issue i mentioned yesterday
[14:03:51] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Great!
[14:04:19] <amigojapan> I see analoq 
[14:04:22] <Emmanuel_Chanel> I'm full vaccinated with Pfizer, too.
[14:04:41] <analoq> e.g. if wine saves something to C:/user/USER/desktop/ it will end up in /home/user/Desktop
[14:04:45] <amigojapan> Yeah me too, Pfizer :)
[14:05:03] <analoq> same~
[14:05:49] <amigojapan> analoq: yeah. This way you can access your Linux files from wine
[14:06:20] <analoq> yeah. it's just i always thought wine tries to sandbox a little. but it doesn't at all
[14:06:20] <amigojapan> It's a feature
[14:06:31] <amigojapan> Right
[14:06:43] * darkpeach is more modern and got moderna
[14:07:10] <amigojapan> Understandable analoq most virtual machines do sandbox
[14:07:13] <analoq> darkpeach: did have side effects? a mate got moderna too, and he was drenched in sweat one night :P
[14:07:32] <darkpeach> very few effects analoq
[14:07:46] <analoq> amigojapan: you can make it a little sandboxy by running 'winetricks sandbox' which cuts out all the symlinks
[14:07:47] <amigojapan> darkpeach: you are not my friend any more :)
[14:07:53] <darkpeach> mostly just a pain at the injection site
[14:08:00] <analoq> yeah same for me
[14:08:04] <darkpeach> amigojapan??
[14:08:16] <amigojapan> Just kidding darkpeach 
[14:08:45] <amigojapan> darkpeach: cause you are not Pfizer group
[14:09:36] <analoq> the shit i had to sign here..it's no wonder so many ppl dont want it
[14:09:53] <analoq> i thought i was taking part in a 50% death probability medical trial lol
[14:10:03] * darkpeach signed nothing

[14:10:40] <amigojapan> analoq: I signed nothing either
[14:11:46] <amigojapan> analoq: how long ago did you get it? Also was it astraZenca?
[14:12:38] <amigojapan> Emmanuel_Chanel: now they are talking about getting a booster shot in 8 months
[14:12:46] <analoq> as i wrote, i got pfizer/comirnaty as well july/august
[14:13:24] <amigojapan> analoq: I see, weird that they had you sign something
[14:13:25] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Yeah.
[14:13:59] <analoq> amigojapan: it was mostly stuff like 'the manufacturer cant be sued if something goes wrong, please acknowledge all the possible sideeffects etc.'
[14:14:51] <analoq> but yeah. if you on one hand tell the people it's just a normal vaccine, but then make them signs this shit.... it doesn't add up
[14:15:17] <amigojapan> I see analoq in Japan the Japanese government made a guarantee of 4000000 yen for the family of anyone who died of the vaccine, plus funeral costs
[14:15:42] <analoq> pretty much the same issue then imho

[14:17:15] <analoq> yeah but it will have the opposite effect. it will strengthen their worries
[14:18:17] <amigojapan> I see
[14:18:57] <amigojapan> analoq: like what can they do to ease the worry? I have no idea
[14:19:19] <analoq> just roll it out like any other influenza vaccine
[14:19:27] <amigojapan> analoq: in Hong Kong they give you free lottery tickets
[14:19:44] <analoq> they were talking about paying people here to get vaccinated.

[14:24:03] <lastonestanding> the main argument is a different one
[14:24:12] <lastonestanding> it's safer and more relaxed

[14:24:18] <lastonestanding> if people drive slower
[14:25:13] <analoq> lastonestanding: they pull whatever card fits the moment. i mean yes 100 is safer than 200. but 50 is even safer than 100. where do you draw the line
[14:25:15] <darkpeach> japan has trains that you are supposed to use instead of driving
[14:25:38] <analoq> iirc japans highway speed is 90? :D
[14:25:56] <amigojapan> darkpeach: they need to lower the price of shinkansen then
[14:26:39] <darkpeach> that is for long trips, which is probably more for business

[16:10:49] <DunceCotus> no it really didn't

[16:11:50] <amigojapan> This video you just showed looks fake to me
[16:11:53] <DunceCotus> the corridor crew one?
[16:11:56] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: how so?
[16:12:03] <amigojapan> The fake video looked the same

[16:15:21] <DunceCotus> ???
[16:15:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its 100% real
[16:15:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I would need to see it in real life
[16:15:43] <DunceCotus> you could buy a Spot robot and program in that dance
[16:15:47] <DunceCotus> and it would look exactly like taht

[16:15:52] <DunceCotus> xD

[16:17:15] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: thing is though it doesn't help them to have some videos real and some fake
[16:17:18] <DunceCotus> or to fake capabilities
[16:17:28] <DunceCotus> since they're selling these for industrial applications
[16:17:48] <DunceCotus> and they need it to be as precise as possible what they're capable of
[16:18:16] <amigojapan> "But while there are several deep fake and CGI videos out there of Boston Dynamic look-a-likes performing unbelievable feats (e.g., fighting back against humans), the dance moves performed in this video are¬†100 percent authentic." DunceCotus it says it in the Boston dynamics page
[16:18:19] <DunceCotus> an Atlas has made great strides
[16:19:05] <DunceCotus> "the dance moves performed in this video are¬†100 percent authentic."
[16:19:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah but those fakes are not by boston dynamics
[16:19:53] <amigojapan> Even if so. They can also do fake and get money from grants
[16:20:37] <darkpeach> you are wrong amigojapan
[16:21:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: in order to sell to industry they need to deliver on their promises tho
[16:21:29] <amigojapan> darkpeach: I will be convinced I am wrong when I see it in real life
[16:21:36] <darkpeach> they don't need grants
[16:21:47] <DunceCotus> they have DARPA money

[16:45:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there may not be a difference
[16:46:14] <DunceCotus> like the idea of cybernetic consciousness vs flesh consciousness

[16:46:50] <DunceCotus> though sure form isn't the same
[16:46:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the differences is that the movie did not actually happen. It was made

[17:10:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I would say yes and no
[17:10:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: parts of them can be mapped onto realtime but other parts no
[17:10:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this is how you can have dreams that feel like they last for longer than the time asleep
[17:14:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the feeling of having to pee is connected to time
[17:15:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sure
[17:15:32] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I hope some day technology advances to the point where we can avoid needing to wake up to pee in the bathroom
[17:15:58] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: catheters already exist
[17:16:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but having to pee is an automatic, unconscious reflex
[17:16:19] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: as well as diapers
[17:16:34] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: sounds uncomfortable
[17:16:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you could say the unconscious overrides consciousness
[17:16:54] <DunceCotus> if you need to pee enough, your body is just going to pee
[17:17:02] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: fipers definitely uncomfortable
[17:17:22] <DunceCotus> point is the consciousness has learned to repress the pee, so the repression brings us back into reality to urinate in a way we desire
[17:17:27] <Urchin[emacs]> DunceCotus: not necessarily, you might end up with a burst blather and die
[17:17:32] <amigojapan> Diapers*
[17:18:18] <DunceCotus> Urchin[emacs]: well it could go either way
[17:18:29] <DunceCotus> depends on how automatic holding in the pee has become (how unconscious)
[17:18:58] <DunceCotus> when we are 'busting' the holding in becomes more conscious and less unconscious
[17:21:33] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: I think that almost never happens. In hospitals in Japan the nurses keep on telling the old ladies "you can pee now. You have a diper on"and they keep on asking to go to the bathroom
[17:22:12] <DunceCotus> nobody wants to revert to baby
[17:22:30] <DunceCotus> babies have no automatic 'holding in' of waste excretion
[17:22:44] <DunceCotus> that has to be learned over time, called the anal stage
[17:23:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: just don't want to get wet. Or even worst have to poop!
[17:23:17] <DunceCotus> the conscious control over bowels and bladder
[17:23:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its unpleasant for babies too
[17:23:45] <amigojapan> I guess
[17:23:47] <DunceCotus> cause we wrap everyone up in clothing, rooms, houses etc
[17:25:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: with no clothes, sheets, rooms or houses, we wouldn't mind peeing or pooing whenever
[17:25:08] <DunceCotus> cause we would just move away
[17:25:24] <DunceCotus> but we've become fixated on certain territories
[17:26:12] <DunceCotus> partitioned territories with places to shit and places to eat
[17:26:22] <DunceCotus> and places to sleep etc.
[17:26:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: nah poop would still be a problem, unless we lived in like rivers
[17:26:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you just bury it

[23:32:04] <lastonestanding> or do you see different colors?
[23:32:26] <Jigsy> I see normally.
[23:32:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Heterochromia isn't correlated with color perception defects in humans except when it occurs as a result of an injury.
[23:33:15] <lastonestanding> I'd rather not injure my eyes

[23:33:29] <lastonestanding> I cannot even imagine the gain
[23:33:30] <lastonestanding> pain
[23:33:59] <darkpeach> no pain no gain
[23:34:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you're not a cute anime girl there won't be a gain anyway
[23:34:35] <AmalLight> no pain , more health 
[23:35:25] <darkpeach> buy colored contacts
[23:36:06] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.107)
[23:36:26] <lastonestanding> now I have to wonder how contacts stay in place
[23:36:49] <lastonestanding> what's the magic behind it...
[23:37:23] <Bco1981> sucktion?
[23:37:45] <lastonestanding> is that a glue?
[23:37:54] <Bco1981> no
[23:38:28] <theholyduck> lastonestanding: nope. theres just no air behind the contact when you squeeze it on
[23:38:37] <theholyduck> it sticks :P 
[23:38:54] <lastonestanding> eww
[23:38:54] <Bco1981> like a sucktion-cup thing
[23:39:00] <theholyduck> i usually prefilled mine with liquid
[23:39:04] <theholyduck> before i stuck them in
[23:39:10] <theholyduck> so they would go on easier
[23:39:30] <theholyduck> the extra fluid acts as a bit of a lubricant to make it seat perfectly in the middle

[23:40:00] <theholyduck> i used contacts like every day from when i was like 10 to when i was 22  
[23:40:09] <theholyduck> at which point i could finally start using glasses
[23:40:13] <lastonestanding> hopefully I will never have to do that
[23:40:27] <theholyduck>  lastonestanding  its not so bad. 
[23:40:35] <theholyduck> if 10 year old me could do it im pretty sure you can
[23:40:52] <Bco1981> "finally start using glasses" why couldn't you? 
[23:40:53] <lastonestanding> I don't want to mess around with my eye balls
[23:41:07] <theholyduck> Bco1981: if the gap in diopters between your left and right eye is bigger than.. 3 points i think
[23:41:12] <theholyduck> you will see double with glasses
[23:41:30] <theholyduck> by 22 it  had eavened out enough
[23:41:36] <Bco1981> then you didn't get the right glasses for you.
[23:41:43] <theholyduck> Bco1981:  no its a optics thing
[23:41:54] <theholyduck> Bco1981: basicly the 2 images on the 2 retinas will be too diffferently sized
[23:42:07] <Bco1981> ah okay
[23:42:27] <lastonestanding> and now I wonder how the back of the eye ball is connected to our brain.... eww!!!

[23:46:47] <darkpeach> get used to looking at anatomical images, then it's not so scary any more
[23:46:47] <theholyduck> contact lenses is the general fix all solution to anisometropia 
[23:46:47] <theholyduck> when i was a kid i even had Antimetropia 
[23:46:47] <theholyduck> i.e 1 eye near sighted 1 eye far sighted
[23:46:51] <Bco1981> damn
