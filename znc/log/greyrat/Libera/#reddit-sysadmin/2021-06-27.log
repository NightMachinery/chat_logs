[02:32:49] <fritzwastaken> I mean

[02:33:10] <fritzwastaken> Programmed by DrGibby
[02:33:21] <fritzwastaken> Conversations follow certain patterns
[02:33:36] <fritzwastaken> Its kinda like Miko on Twitch
[02:33:47] <fritzwastaken> DrGibby speaks through gibby
[02:34:08] <fritzwastaken> riff-IRC: did you go to gibbyfarts.com?
[02:34:16] <riff-IRC> no
[02:34:17] <fritzwastaken> I hope you didnt
[02:34:20] <fritzwastaken> ok goods
[02:34:23] <riff-IRC> why
[02:34:36] <fritzwastaken> From what I can tell its kinda a social experiment
[02:35:13] <fritzwastaken> Ive logged into it from a few different locations and the resulting site changes slightly based on where you log into it from
[02:35:49] <fritzwastaken> Fairly sure its geo-locating your IP and changing the homepage accordingly
[02:36:21] <riff-IRC> huh
[02:36:27] <fritzwastaken> us AWS users get the same page, but people logging in from residential IPs in different regions get something different
[02:37:36] <fritzwastaken> People have mentioned its kind of an ARG
[02:38:07] <fritzwastaken> But the site is pretty basic without any hints or clues to the next step
[02:38:49] <fritzwastaken> we also went back and logged the times that gibby posted the site, and there isnt much of a coorelation
[02:39:55] <Sousapro> Wow openvpn became pretty proud of their product in the last 6 months haven't they? 
[02:40:05] <Sousapro> Dad got a 3x renewal quote lol
[02:40:44] <fritzwastaken> NordVPN, the most popular VPN for... nothing
[02:40:46] <Sousapro> Has anyone here implemented pritunl for VPN access? 
[02:40:51] <fritzwastaken> Sign up at nordvpn.com/gibby
[02:40:58] <fritzwastaken> nordvpn.com/gibby
[02:41:12] <mkillebrew> you have to pay for openvpn?
[02:41:20] <Sousapro> OpenVPN Access Server
[02:41:26] <mkillebrew> oh, so a service.
[02:41:57] <Sousapro> Eh more an appliance that makes it possible for a non-sysadmin to implement it quickly 
[02:42:35] <Sousapro> I wouldn't have implemented it that way but I've had to help him precisely zero times with weird errors, crashes or update issues for 4 years lol
[02:43:16] <Sousapro> Not sure 10 seats is worth $750 annually though lol
[02:44:14] <Sousapro> My dad got OpenVPN AS running in 15 minutes without help and having never built out a VPN solution 
[02:46:18] <Sousapro> So now I get to support his stuff or let him get taken advantage of

[02:48:01] <sd> 13<C​olour> Kinda surprised at the lack of problems
[02:48:33] <Sousapro> The only real problems are administration 
[02:48:42] <Sousapro> Which if you're decent at Linux isn't a problem 
[02:48:51] <Sousapro> I'm running it at home right now through unraid 
[02:49:12] <Sousapro> Unraid makes it trivial to implement and gives it a decent admin interface which is nice 
[02:49:14] <sd> 13<C​olour> I wrote a guide for peeps at work to use and they just copied what I wrote. They weren't confident using linux at all being Windows only admins.
[02:49:32] <sd> 13<C​olour> But it worked for them too
[02:49:38] <sd> 13<C​olour> No need to be afraid of putting it on a Linux vm
[02:49:53] <Sousapro> Right now I have zero support responsibilities 
[02:50:06] <Sousapro> Guess who is getting calls if something comes up? 
[02:50:09] <riff-IRC> If you're tailoring instructions to total noobs, make sure the instructions work exactly as intended on the intended environment.
[02:50:15] <riff-IRC> Sousapro: You
[02:50:36] <sd> 13<C​olour> I like documenting and writing instructions for some reason

[04:04:05] <shibboleth> yeah, and your conflating your preferences for sane logic
[04:04:17] <shibboleth> with
[04:04:36] <shibboleth> that you have aids doesn't make aids "not good"
[04:04:45] <shibboleth> that you have aids doesn't make aids "good"
[04:04:48] <A-KO> it's not a preference, it's sane? Microsoft has a cloud account system--like every other hardware maker. Android phones do this. iPhones do this. Chromebooks do this.
[04:04:53] <xe0n> wtf aids, really?
[04:04:59] <shibboleth> but what about the children?
[04:05:00] <A-KO> this is hardly anything that anyone else isn't doing
[04:05:02] <shibboleth> black lives matter?
[04:05:17] <shibboleth> or something other, entirely unrelated to the premise of my assertion?
[04:05:24] <ravioli> what
[04:05:30] <ravioli> are you ok
[04:05:36] <shibboleth> let's say the internal wifi adapter malfunctions and win11 doesn't have built-in drivers for the usb replacement you bought three years later?
[04:05:39] <shibboleth> well, now you're stuck between a rock and a hard place, you won't be able to get through win11 install/oobe
[04:05:44] <shibboleth> "oh, but get a new pc"
[04:05:47] <shibboleth> chromebooks do this
[04:06:00] <shibboleth> but i... like msft accounts
[04:06:18] <shibboleth> i'm assuming whoever said this isn't like 12 years old?
[04:06:39] <ravioli> are you ok
[04:06:55] <xe0n> errr so.. maybe you havent read between the lines of all the press releases, or listened to the event, or known the back story towards all of this....win11 is designed for new machines, and the idea is to sell more PCs, the directive is coming from OEMs lol
[04:07:06] <xe0n> win 10 has plenty of support left, and then by that time, you'll want a new machine
[04:07:07] <xe0n> so you'll get one
[04:07:09] <xe0n> and that can run 11
[04:07:20] <shibboleth> xe0n, and?
[04:07:30] <xe0n> and you're upset your current machine doesn't run it?
[04:07:39] <shibboleth> buy a new win11 device, three years later the internal wnic malfunctions
[04:07:55] <A-KO> lots of people are upset that their broken half-working PCs that were built 8 years ago aren't going to work on Windows 11
[04:07:56] <shibboleth> and win11 doesnt have built-in drivers for the usb replacement
[04:07:58] <A-KO> dunno what to say
[04:08:03] <xe0n> you know you can install drivers in the windows setup, right?
[04:08:04] <A-KO> at some point it's time to upgrade or replace it
[04:08:11] *** Quits: codingpanic (~pi@151.236.4.17) (Changing host)
[04:08:11] *** Joins: codingpanic (~pi@user/codingpanic)
[04:08:25] <shibboleth> xe0n, yes, i've pressed f6
[04:09:19] <A-KO> yeah it sucks that your Haswell-based system isn't going to run Win11 even though it still functions. Lots of systems still function. Hell, you can still find Windows XP systems with Pentium 3's that still function. Doesn't mean you should still run it.
[04:09:56] <xe0n> and im sure if you have a piece of defective hardware, the vendor will cover that
[04:10:21] <xe0n> can't say ive known\had too many instances were a wifi module has busted, but hey not saying it cant happen
[04:10:33] <shibboleth> yeah, and sometims there are sweaty people on the bus.. but just like every single thing you've said this has zero bearing on the validity of the logic of my initial argument
[04:10:39] <shibboleth> which you said was flawed
[04:10:50] <xe0n> so what are you mainly upset about, the microsoft account stuff?
[04:11:17] <shibboleth> msft playing chicken-and-egg with win11 home oobe
[04:11:29] <A-KO> yes
[04:11:50] <A-KO> I don't get it
[04:11:51] <A-KO> really
[04:11:53] <cryptic1> BUT MUH WIN11
[04:12:07] <A-KO> Google comes out with Android, literally forces a google account on you, spies the fuck out of you, their entire business model is spying on you
[04:12:12] <A-KO> but MIcrosoft makes a Microsoft account
[04:12:15] <A-KO> aaaaaaaaaaaaaand the world is ending
[04:12:26] <A-KO> like give me a fucking break
[04:12:31] <xe0n> microsoft account is super handy
[04:12:42] <A-KO> the cloud-based connectivity and account system ship sailed a long time ago
[04:12:45] <A-KO> get with the program
[04:12:46] <shibboleth> <A-KO> that example is flawed
[04:12:56] <xe0n> ive used one...for years lol, its not fun logging into a new pc and having to set it up from scratch, waste of time
[04:13:00] <A-KO> same
[04:13:03] <shibboleth> please, this is 15 minutes later and you're still pulling shit our of yoyr ear
[04:13:03] <A-KO> same same
[04:13:18] <xe0n> i dont mind logging into an account, just like i do when i purchase a new iphone
[04:13:20] <cryptic1> only 15 minutes later?
[04:13:27] <xe0n> put in my icloud, boom, things work like my old phone
[04:13:28] <shibboleth> feels like lat year
[04:13:28] <xe0n> nice
[04:14:30] <A-KO> xe0n: I fixed my PC btw
[04:14:32] <A-KO> turns out
[04:14:37] <A-KO> fucking motherboard and ram can't run 4 slots
[04:14:39] <A-KO> :(
[04:14:43] <xe0n> nice
[04:14:45] <ravioli> shibboleth you should switch to mac
[04:14:56] <cryptic1> macs just work
[04:14:59] <shibboleth> no... unicorns
[04:15:00] <cryptic1> easy mode
[04:15:01] <A-KO> switch to mac, where you need Apple ID :D
[04:15:04] <shibboleth> purple ones
[04:15:05] <shibboleth> and crocs
[04:15:10] <xe0n> lol @ the comments that people are saying about hackintoshes making a come back, errr hello, intel macs are dead...
[04:15:11] <ravioli> think different
[04:17:48] <shibboleth> and, to placate those with an understanding of colinear dynamics comparable to that of a six-year-old: my argument doesn't touch on "whether msft acct = dumb/not dumb". it's that win11 home oobe requires uplink + msft acct.
[04:18:03] <ravioli> are you ok
[04:18:49] <xe0n> you realise home does that now pretty much?
[04:18:56] <shibboleth> YES
[04:19:05] <shibboleth> and that is exactly what i'm saying
[04:19:17] <shibboleth> but in win11 there is no way around it
[04:19:20] <xe0n> do you run home?
[04:19:37] <cryptic1> But do you realize it?
[04:19:58] <shibboleth> meaning, "you'll" (consumers) be unable to get through oobe under entirely predictable circumstances
[04:20:23] <shibboleth> also: don't shit upstream of where you get your drinking water
[04:22:04] <ravioli> ...is that a no
[04:22:56] <xe0n> ++
[04:22:56] <shibboleth> ravioli, well, i've kept iterating my initial argument and have been fending up retorts like... "your argument is flawed because my head is bird"
[04:23:06] <shibboleth> and you're asking *me* if i'm ok?
[04:23:16] <xe0n> no, i asked if you run home?
[04:23:17] <xe0n> lol
[04:23:17] <shibboleth> fending off
[04:23:45] <shibboleth> i implicitly answered with <shibboleth> meaning, "you'll" (consumers)
[04:24:17] <shibboleth> no, i don't run winhome, but winhome 11 users will be the ones finding themselves between a rock and a hard place here
[04:24:43] <cryptic1> win home is for consumers they don't give a fuck
[04:24:45] <xe0n> then stfu! you're yapping on about bullshit that doesn't even affect you
[04:24:47] <cryptic1> they are not power users
[04:25:00] <shibboleth> well they sure as shit will care when they find themselves in this situation
[04:25:07] <cryptic1> they literally won't care
[04:25:12] <cryptic1> computer turns on? OK GOOD
[04:25:14] <cryptic1> PUTER GOOD
[04:25:15] <xe0n> hey if they've bought a new pc, and the wifi doesnt work, they're going to return it
[04:25:16] <cryptic1> ME AM HAPPY
[04:25:28] <shibboleth> except it won't be working
[04:25:37] <xe0n> you realise consumers don't "upgrade" their OS, they just use whatever they have, if they get offerd a free upgrade, great, they'll install it without knowing
[04:25:40] <cryptic1> then it gets returned
[04:25:48] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> let's say the internal wifi adapter malfunctions and win11 doesn't have built-in drivers for the usb replacement you bought three years later?
[04:25:50] <shibboleth> again
[04:26:03] <cryptic1> and lets say it doesn't
[04:26:13] <cryptic1> you buy another usb adapter
[04:26:18] <cryptic1> WOW WIFIS BACK
[04:26:26] <xe0n> how often are you reinstalling fucking windows?! consumers will then take it somewhere to get fixed, and it'll come back fixed
[04:26:32] <A-KO> ^
[04:26:46] <A-KO> xe0n, cryptic1, WoW? :P
[04:26:53] <shibboleth> sure, one that retroactively includes drivers on prev versions of windows?
[04:26:57] <shibboleth> sure, why did i not think of that
[04:27:06] <shibboleth> right, because i don't have the fucking time-stone
[04:27:06] <cryptic1> what are you even saysing
[04:27:08] <cryptic1> saying
[04:27:18] <xe0n> this reminds me of your MCU plot hole junk you were yapping on about the other week, total fan fiction, making scenarios in your head lol!
[04:27:18] <cryptic1> you are making no sense
[04:27:25] <xe0n> ^^
[04:27:38] <cryptic1> they would replace this old usb wifi adapter with another
[04:27:39] <shibboleth> xe0n, except what i said was... heavily hinted at in ep3
[04:27:52] <shibboleth> xe0n, but yeah, you didn't get what i was saying
[04:28:28] <shibboleth> "but 2012"
[04:28:56] <xe0n> you idiot
[04:29:02] <gibby> 🍿
[04:29:06] <Sousapro> Are we experiencing drama because Microsoft Account on home skus? 
[04:29:09] <xe0n> talk to me about comic books when you've actually read them
[04:29:09] <cryptic1> whoa whoa whoa
[04:29:17] <shibboleth> not really
[04:29:18] <A-KO> whoa it's gibby
[04:29:23] <A-KO> and Sousapro
[04:29:25] <A-KO> how goes it?
[04:29:29] <shibboleth> but the way it's implemented in win11 home is defective design
[04:29:36] <xe0n> ITS THE SAME AS WINDOWS 10
[04:29:41] <gibby> you're a defective design 
[04:29:45] <xe0n> literally the same as it is now
[04:29:45] <xe0n> LOL
[04:29:45] <A-KO> gibby: fixed my computer btw
[04:29:50] <gibby> A-KO: nice
[04:29:56] <shibboleth> no, afaik in win10 you *can* install using a local account
[04:29:59] <A-KO> shit's purring super smooth now
[04:30:02] <A-KO> suuuuuuuuuper smooth
[04:30:08] <A-KO> also, fuck the ram industry right now
[04:30:09] <A-KO> seriously
[04:30:17] <shibboleth> according to win11 news you *must* have uplink+msft acct for w11 home oobe
[04:30:18] <xe0n> haha fuck all things that use ICs :P
[04:30:24] <Sousapro> A-KO: going good man. They like me doing devoops enough that we're talking about making me a manager and building out a team
[04:30:33] <A-KO> oh shnap
[04:30:33] <A-KO> nice
[04:30:46] <xe0n> you realise shibboleth, microsoft has a history of wording things..weird...and they always clarify, just give it time, it's only been a day or two since the news lol
[04:30:49] <Sousapro> I'm excited
[04:30:50] <xe0n> there's _lots_ they need to clarify
[04:30:58] <Sousapro> How's life been A-KO? 
[04:31:05] <A-KO> eh
[04:31:19] <A-KO> I've been dealing with food poisoning the past few days. Thankfully the shitting my brains out stuff is just about over.
[04:31:25] <xe0n> LOL
[04:31:25] <A-KO> I only had to poop once today, I consider that a win
[04:31:31] <xe0n> hahaha
[04:31:38] <Sousapro> Damn man. I'm glad you're doing better now 
[04:32:07] <shibboleth> xe0n, which is yet another whataboutism. every single counter-argument to my initial one have been whataboutisms
[04:33:02] <shibboleth> which, sure, is rapidly making me feel "not ok".
[04:33:05] <A-KO> I kind of wanted to go to the bar this weekend and get fucked up drunk--but I'm not going to do that now because I don't want to be fucked up drunk AND shit myself
[04:33:07] <A-KO> that wouldn't be fun
[04:33:12] <xe0n> LOLL
[04:33:12] <A-KO> so I'll avoid that this weekend
[04:33:23] <gibby> Do it anyway A-KO

[04:54:17] <shibboleth> xe0n> then stfu! you're yapping on about bullshit that doesn't even affect you <--- this kinda sums it up beautifully. here, let me employ a whataboutism: so why should i care about racism if i'm not adversely affected by it?
[04:56:59] <shibboleth> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists
[05:00:20] <shibboleth> see, if one person says A and 200 others say B people in group B have a tendency towards assuming that the minority opinion is whack
[05:04:03] <ravioli> are you mentally ill
[05:05:20] <xe0n> i'm pretty sure microsoft have thought about specific scenarios, and until we have the product in our hands and poking at it, you're taking information at face value from marketing materials released. i said earlier today (and on thursday), information is going to be clarified
[05:05:30] <xe0n> i even mentioned that the pc health app is getting a new build
[05:05:36] <xe0n> and whaddya know? new build was released
[05:05:36] <xe0n> lol
[05:05:37] <shibboleth> well, hopefully this will happen
[05:05:51] <shibboleth> either the boilerplate info is wrong or they'll realize the mistake
[05:05:58] <shibboleth> their
[05:06:34] <shibboleth> ravioli, why do you ask?
[05:06:52] <shibboleth> ravioli, that you don't get it doesn't make other party wrong or crazy
[05:07:35] <ravioli> no i understand what you're saying
[05:07:45] <ravioli> i think everyone did like 45 minutes ago or whatever
[05:07:48] <shibboleth> ok, is what i've been saying wrong?
[05:08:35] <ravioli> i mean if i'm following you it seems like if i disagree then your head is a bird for some reason
[05:08:55] <shibboleth> that was an example of a non-sequitur
[05:09:03] <ravioli> hold on let me get out my thesaurus here
[05:09:18] <shibboleth> which there have been plenty of, only not by me
[05:09:20] <ravioli> i think it means that you possess the "colinear dynamics comparable to that of a six-year-old"
[05:09:30] <shibboleth> understanding of
[05:09:30] <ravioli> sorry had to look that one up real quick
[05:09:34] <shibboleth> colinear dynamics
[05:09:42] <shibboleth> comparable to that of a six-year old
[05:09:58] <ravioli> are you ok
[05:11:27] <shibboleth> do you ask because you don't know what colinear dynamics is or do you take issue with my syntax?
[05:12:55] <ravioli> i'm asking just because of your train of thought but now that you mention it i have no idea what colinear dynamics are
[05:13:32] <shibboleth> so basically, you're attempting to ridicule me for having used words you don't understand?
[05:13:46] <ravioli> no i'm just curious
[05:14:06] <ravioli> i'm not ridiculing you for that.
[05:14:39] <ravioli> i'm ridiculing you for saying "you're wrong for having a different opinion about windows accounts" and then saying "that you don't get it doesn't make the other party wrong"
[05:14:44] <shibboleth> you've implied mental illness on my part
[05:16:00] <ravioli> well yeah, you don't even use mac os
[05:16:43] <shibboleth> and you do not have an ipod?
[05:16:51] <shibboleth> i guess that... clears it up, then?
[05:17:06] <shibboleth> <ravioli> i'm ridiculing you for saying "you're wrong for having a different opinion about windows accounts" and then saying "that you don't get it doesn't make the other party wrong"
[05:18:03] <shibboleth> i explicitly stated that this had nothing to with anyones opinion on msft accts
[05:18:30] <shibboleth> so that's the second time your argument is based on misquoting me

[23:20:51] <shibboleth> shinobi is an npm package
[23:21:17] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> node.js run locally can access syscalls iirc
[23:21:22] <shibboleth> it can't magically make the userland ffmpeg use quicksync, cuda, etc
[23:22:00] <shibboleth> yes, but due to licensing issues ffmpeg can't be shipped by distros with for example cuda enabled
[23:22:20] <shibboleth> for that you'll have to build ffmpeg yourself againt cuda
[23:22:32] <shibboleth> anyway, shinobi?
