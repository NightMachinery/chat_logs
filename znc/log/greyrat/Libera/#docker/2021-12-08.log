[00:00:58] <tabakhase> cornfeedhobo if it was a ARG you can ARG/ENV 'again' - but not "push out" or such, only thing pullable from stage to stage is filesystem
[00:02:19] <tabakhase> cornfeedhobo like, if you wanted to set a XY_VERSION param on the final after downloading "latest" in stage1 thats "impossible" if i kinda understand correctly...

[00:49:40] <jkent3> from apt-get
[00:52:52] <programmerq> the docs.docker.com instructions for ubuntu do ask that you remove the docker.io package since it can cause issues like what you ran into. glad you got it working. :)
[00:53:54] <jkent3> strangely, i had removed it… but removing through apt-get doesn’t work … it leaves the snap lying around I guess

[01:18:42] <schangg> Hello
[01:19:33] <schangg> I would like to have my containers on the same broadcast network as my host along with Virtualbox virtual machines on that same broadcast network
[01:20:01] <schangg> so far the containers and the host are on the same broadcast network just as expected
[01:20:08] <schangg> VMs too using bridge mode
[01:20:24] <schangg> however VMs and containers can not reach eachother
[01:20:38] <schangg> I have used macvlan for the containers setup

[01:23:46] <programmerq> not sure if that rings a bell for you?

[07:51:52] <Nothing4You> for example i have 10.0.0.0/24, i want to reserve 10.0.0.0/28 for one set of containers and 10.0.0.16/28 for a different set of containers
[07:52:03] <Nothing4You> i'm configuring the containers via compose
[07:52:33] <Nothing4You> while i could provide a static ip for each container, that would remove the ability of using scale to run multiple instances

[08:04:57] <Nothing4You> that was my original idea but then dns doesn't seem to be able to resolve containers in the other network
[08:05:47] <tarek58> more importantly though, if the two types of containers need to communicate with each other, why do they need to be on separate subnets?
[08:09:52] <Nothing4You> mostly so i can have different firewall rules for them without using static ips which would prevent me from using scale
[08:10:47] <Nothing4You> alternative would be to just create a template service and duplicate that a few times with static ips as needed

[08:17:56] <Nothing4You> so it wouldn't really solve the issue either, unless i put multiple names in the consuming application
[08:19:33] <tarek58> are these containers binding to ports?
[08:19:38] <Nothing4You> no
[08:19:47] <Nothing4You> well not publishing
[08:19:52] <Nothing4You> they're binding to ports on the container ips only
[08:24:12] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[08:24:47] <tarek58> ok, so then how do firewall rules come into play?
[08:25:04] <tabakhase> ye this doesnt make much sense...
[08:25:19] <tarek58> if the containers run on a bridge netowrk (default network type), noone can access them to begin with:  only the containers within that same bridge network can "talk" to each other
[08:25:19] <Nothing4You> restricting communication between containers (based on the subnets defined) and outbound communication
[08:26:37] <tabakhase> any kinda restricting asside from "yes / no" has smell...
[08:27:11] <Nothing4You> in what way?
[08:27:16] <tabakhase> kinda hits this "docker may not be the tool you are looking for" gist
[08:27:59] <tabakhase> as "docker is not a security product™"
[08:29:08] <Nothing4You> my containers are not running as root which already mitigates the majority of potential issues
[08:29:38] <Nothing4You> each container runs with its own uid/gid, firewall rules, even within the same bridge via net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables
[08:29:48] <tarek58> OK well here's my input
[08:29:53] <tarek58> again, this is just One Guy's opinion
[08:30:18] <tarek58> let's say you have two groups, GroupA 10.20.0.0/28 and groupB 10.20.0.16/28
[08:31:01] <tarek58> If you do not want communication between GroupA and GroupB this is an implicit feature of the bridge networking engine.  if you want to also stop these containers from having access to the internet (if the host is connected to the internet) you can specify 'internal: true' in your docker-compose networks key
[08:31:24] <tarek58> That means the containers in Group A will be able to ping others in Group A but not in Group B.  And, containers in either gruop cannot ping external hosts (say, 8.8.8.8 etc)
[08:32:13] *** Quits: rvalue (~rvalue@user/rvalue) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:32:40] <Nothing4You> you can basically ignore the firewall/isolation part because that's already covered, i was basically just wondering about dns (which could for individual hosts be resolved via aux_addresses), but there doesn't seem to be a good way that doesn't require statically assigning ips to containers
[08:32:58] <tarek58> well it's kind of a 'one thing' or the other
[08:33:06] <tarek58> either you want the containers to be able to communicate or not
[08:33:08] <Nothing4You> only if you let docker handle your firewall
[08:33:12] <Nothing4You> which i don#t
[08:33:24] <Nothing4You> so i have significantly more flexibility with the firewall rules
[08:33:34] <tarek58> ok
[08:33:59] <Nothing4You> in my configuration even 2 containers on the same bridge network can't ping each other unless explicitly granted
[08:34:21] <tarek58> well, the scenario I was describing above (internal=true, two separate subnets, two sepraate networks) is easy enough to set up
[08:34:39] <Nothing4You> but even then, dns would still not work
[08:34:46] <Nothing4You> which is what i was primarily asking about
[08:34:51] <tarek58> I see
[08:35:02] <tarek58> So you want to use service discovery but control the network ranges
[08:35:11] <tarek58> while having all containers on one logical network that can communicate
[08:35:28] <Nothing4You> ideally on 2 different networks which can talk to each other (which docker probably doesn't know)
[08:35:28] *** Joins: fanhako (~fanhako@238.209.74.41-ip-dyn.orange.mg)
[08:37:00] <Nothing4You> it seems that unless both containers share the same network (could even be a shared third network which could be set as internal) dns wouldn't work
[08:37:12] <Nothing4You> though i haven't tested dns with multiple networks on a container yet
[08:38:45] <Nothing4You> in the majority of deployments it does make sense for them to not be able to resolve in other networks
[08:39:23] <tarek58> well, like I said, the default networking driver would treat these as basically two separate nets with two separate subnet allocations (and that's why you can't do DNS)
[08:39:44] <Nothing4You> yeah
[08:39:57] <tarek58> I think wha tyou're trying to do is infer container type by network address and exercise control in this way
[08:40:12] <Nothing4You> basically, yes
[08:41:12] <fanhako> hi, my / partition is full and I'm trying to move docker data dir. I created a /etc/docker/daemon.json with the content {"data-root":"/path/to/new/docker"}, systemctl stop docker and docker.socket, copied the content of /var/lib/docker with rsync -aqxP, emptied the source directory, systemctl daemon-reload, systemctl start docker. But when I run docker images, it find nothing. What did I miss ?
[08:42:37] <tabakhase> fanhako just images gone or "everything"?
[08:42:43] <tabakhase> cause that sounds about fine
[08:42:56] <tarek58> Nothing4You:  I guess in yoru situation the static IP may be the way to go then.  Basically, at the docker level, create one network and at the container level, just manually ensure that each 'group' ends up on the logical subnet you wanted
[08:43:42] <tarek58> Nothing4You: One out of the box idea would be to use a templating engine (outside of docker, I mean) to set up a template which generates an actual docker-compose.yml file with your requirements.
[08:44:27] <Nothing4You> probably overkill in this case, but yeah, probably, if i wanted to scale it up properly
[08:44:38] <tarek58> Because, yaml anchors prevent rote duplicaiton, but I think incrementing the IP address by one and so on woudl be beyond the scope of plain yaml
[08:45:03] <fanhako> tabakhase, I think everything. Why does that "sounds about fine" ?
[08:45:05] <Nothing4You> yeah, that would have to be done manually
[08:46:12] <Nothing4You> only other challenge then is ensuring that the consuming applications connect to the right set of containers, either via load balancer or directly supported in the application vs otherwise dns "load balancing"/service discovery
[08:46:20] <Nothing4You> but i don't see any other way either
[08:46:28] <Nothing4You> thanks for your input
[08:46:43] <tarek58> Nothing4You: 
[08:46:45] <tarek58> https://hub.docker.com/plugins/weave-net-plugin
[08:47:12] <tarek58> Never used it, but it may be part of a solution.  In a general sense, a custom networking plugin may do what you want
[08:47:15] <tabakhase> fanhako if everything is gone - tripplechecked you dont maybe have a folder to much nesting or such? ;D - cause "sounds about fine" as in "yea, normally that should function.. o.O"
[08:48:03] <Nothing4You> probably not worth the effort in my scale, and that type of sdn seems like it would probably prevent my firewall customizations

[12:06:13] <meandrain> Hi. I have 4-5 docker instances running. At one point docker seems to freeze the guest, because I cannot ssh into the machine or reboot the machine. Only a hard reset would make the host machine running again. But then after the hard reset, running "docker ps -a" shows a machine was up until hard reset. So it is possible that one of the instance will mess the networking so I could not ping/ssh, and sending reset 
[12:06:13] <meandrain> signals will not reboot the machine. It is a remote machine, I don't have access to it. 
[12:06:33] <meandrain> So my question is how can I debug what the problem is ?
[12:07:06] <meandrain> This has happened to me on latest Ubuntu and Debian distros.
[12:07:48] <meandrain> It is an AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-Core Processor machine with 128 GB RAM.

[18:07:10] <programmerq> gebbione▸ yes, docker will compress the layers as it pushes to any registry. they're uncompressed on disk so they can be used.
[18:07:30] <programmerq> uncompressed on disk where your docker engine is running, that is.

[19:02:19] <gebbione> programmerq, is there a way to work out locally how it would be when compressed to know how much space is using on the registery?
[19:03:24] <programmerq> gebbione▸ not really. none of the compression algorithms that I'm aware of can tell you what the final size will be until it actually compresses it for you. You could probably do a 'docker save' on the image, which also compresses it, and that could give you an idea.
[19:03:55] <programmerq> or does it compress it? It gives you a tarball at the very least and you could run that through the compression yourself if you really want to get a number.
[19:04:30] <programmerq> normally it tends to be the other way around, folks want to know how big the image would be uncompressed and don't care how much space it requires on the registry.
