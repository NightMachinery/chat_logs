[00:44:41] <GuiToris> hello, how can I share my jsfiddle?
[00:44:45] <GuiToris> something is not right
[00:49:57] <theskillwithin> of course, thats the best way to get help infact
[00:50:28] <GuiToris> I mean I don't know the method how it can be shared
[00:51:01] <GuiToris> how can I make a link of it?
[00:51:28] <GuiToris> I don't have to register, do I?
[00:52:56] <FunkyBob> GuiToris: save it, and link to the updated url
[00:53:08] <FunkyBob> no, you shouldn't need to register
[00:54:44] <GuiToris> https://jsfiddle.net/y4r1sznh/
[00:54:47] <GuiToris> I hope this works
[00:54:54] <GuiToris> so I have a problem with this
[00:55:11] <GuiToris> why does background-position do the opposite thing?
[00:55:40] <GuiToris> if I type bottom it goes up, and if I type top it goes down
[00:55:49] <GuiToris> I really don't understand this behavior

[01:14:35] <FunkyBob> GuiToris: when I set top, the background moves to the top...
[01:15:15] <FunkyBob> if the window is short, it may feel like setting bottom moves it up, because it's aligning the bottom edge of the image with the bottom of the viewport
[01:19:22] <GuiToris> how could I stick this image to the bottom of the page?
[01:20:50] <GuiToris> I get it, the transparent background is what confuses me
[01:24:22] <GuiToris> FunkyBob, what do you think of this? https://jsfiddle.net/kmajghnv/
[01:24:40] <GuiToris> how bad is this solution?
[01:28:05] <FunkyBob> but the image _is_ stuck to the bottom of the page
[01:28:31] <FunkyBob> perhaps you need to trim all the non-content borders from the image first?
[01:29:26] <theskillwithin> btw theres this buttton on the top right corner where you putt he css called Tidy, that will make it easier to read
[01:29:34] <FunkyBob> heh
[01:29:42] <FunkyBob> i wish codepen had that
[01:30:02] <theskillwithin> I think they do
[01:30:21] <theskillwithin> for css questions, i slightly prefer codepen over jsfiddle.  but thats me just nit picking
[01:30:45] <GuiToris> oh, I didn't know what tidy was for
[01:30:51] <theskillwithin> =]
[01:30:55] <GuiToris> FunkyBob, can css trim my image?
[01:31:06] <GuiToris> but I'm basically happy with 80%
[01:31:36] <FunkyBob> you can compensate for your poorly cropped image with css...
[01:31:41] <FunkyBob> but it's much easier to fix the image
[01:32:08] <theskillwithin> i think if its not a background its object-fit property for images?
[01:32:51] <GuiToris> thank you for your help :)
[01:32:55] <theskillwithin> and ya on background images its background-size i think
[01:33:10] <theskillwithin> ooo nice your using webp
[01:33:33] <GuiToris> I'm using webp, because it's an animation
[01:33:39] <GuiToris> I didn't want to use gif
[01:35:13] <theskillwithin> if you want it at the top wouldn't it be background-position: center top;
[01:35:22] <theskillwithin> sorry I wasn't following along
[01:35:52] <FunkyBob> theskillwithin: it appears to move down when you do that, IFF your viewport is small enough
[01:36:28] <GuiToris> I would have never figured it out if FunkyBob hadn't told me
[01:36:37] <GuiToris> I just noticed it moved up

[17:29:08] <goddard> can i cancel out some css classes some how?
[17:32:04] <pavonia> Depends on what you mean by that exactly
[17:32:58] <pavonia> You can override styles for certains elements, or you can exclude certain elements from a style

[17:46:41] <hassoon> ya define "cancelling out some css"
[17:47:23] <goddard> well
[17:47:30] <goddard> basically i am working on this horrific project
[17:47:45] <goddard> they apply bootstrap classes via JS to jquery UI elements
[17:47:57] <goddard> it "works" but it is super annoying to fix things up
[17:48:27] <goddard> Currently as an example i can apply my classes to button elements when they are created for a jquery dialog but it has its own themes
[17:48:34] <goddard> so it basically screws up any classes i put on it
[17:52:12] <hassoon> goddard: you need to write your css code with higher specifity that the one written by js
[17:52:50] <hassoon> goddard: that will make you able to override dynamically generated css

[18:59:20] <podeni> Hi everyone. I'm curious if it's possible to resize an HTML element such that it fits a background image? Use case: I have an image that I want as background for a specific DIV, and I want the DIV width & height to be as much as they need to be to show the full image.
[18:59:39] <hassoon> ubri: cropped bottom ?
[19:00:28] <podeni> No cropping of the image.
[19:00:45] <hassoon> podeni: not you
[19:00:50] <ubri> Yes. There's about 8-10 lines of text that just disappear between the preview and the pdf file or the printed page.
[19:03:53] <hassoon> ubri: you got alot of page breaks first
[19:04:05] <ubri> after each section
[19:05:36] <ubri> an image is better than a thousand words : https://www.ubri.fr/didactique/images/screen-preview.png
[19:06:01] <ubri> Two images, in fact : https://www.ubri.fr/didactique/images/screen_pdf.png
[19:06:37] <ubri> The first is is the preview before printing. The second the export. Printing does the same result. Where are my lines gone ?
[19:07:10] <hassoon> ubri: i don't see cropped lines
