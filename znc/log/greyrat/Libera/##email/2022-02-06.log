[20:33:28] <kj7rrv> I always use webmail with my self hosted email, never native clients. Is it okay to block IMAP, POP3, and SMTP submission ports in the firewall?
[20:35:40] <bremner> sure, why not?
[20:36:45] <pj> check to see what your webmail client uses, they will usually use IMAP and submission.
[20:36:52] <kj7rrv> I was just making sure there wasn't something that would rely on them
[20:37:04] <kj7rrv> It does, but it runs on the same host
[20:37:13] <kj7rrv> It's SOGo
[20:37:56] <pj> That's fine, then, just be careful you don't block the ports on localhost by accident.  Also make sure they're actually using localhost and aren't accidentally configured to use the public IP.
[20:39:15] <kj7rrv> Okay
[20:39:20] <pj> and also(2) II would disable POP3 entirely, and configure IMAP and submission so they only actually listen on localhost.  Even though blocking from the firewall should be sufficient there's no reason to have them listening globally.
[20:39:37] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[20:40:14] <kj7rrv> And then in the future if I start using a native client, I would just change them back to the public IP?
[20:40:20] <pj> yep
[20:40:28] <pj> but you still probably won't need POP3
[20:40:41] <pj> the only really valid use for POP3 nowadays is for gmail fetch.
[20:40:49] <kj7rrv> Yeah I already blocked POP3 in the firewall, I'll see how to disable it
[20:42:45] <kj7rrv> Should I set listen=localhost or listen=127.0.0.1?
[20:46:35] <kj7rrv> Outgoing mail works
[20:47:20] <kj7rrv> And so does incoming
[20:47:58] <pj> In dovecot?
[20:49:32] <kj7rrv> Yes
[20:49:43] <kj7rrv> It's working with 127.0.0.1
[20:50:27] <pj> okay

[20:59:20] <kj7rrv> So port 25 is the only port that has to be allowed for a mail server, right?
[20:59:40] <kj7rrv> (and 443 for webmail)
[20:59:48] <kj7rrv> (and 22 for ssh)
[21:00:32] <jaybe> and 21922 for custom secret top stealth ssh
[21:00:53] <jaybe> it's not 'allowed' per se, but it's often let slide
[21:01:21] <kj7rrv> ???
[21:01:21] <jaybe> port 25 is if the port mail servers use to talk with other mail servers, historically, and currently
[21:01:37] <kj7rrv> Yeah I have it allowed
