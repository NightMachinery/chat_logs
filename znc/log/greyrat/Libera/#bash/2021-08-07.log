[00:20:30] <greycat> Some programs simply abort with an error.  Some simply punt to /bin/sh.  Bash reads the first 100-ish bytes, looks for NULs, and if it doesn't find any, launches a child bash process to read it.
[00:22:56] <emanuele6> right. i always justified that behaviour by thing it was the kernel; i would have never thought it would be the shell, it is a bit weird to run it with /bin/sh, but that is what they do.

That is a judgement call, and my judgement is, no. Running compilers and linkers, doing megabytes of I/O, and creating temporary binary files is not a justifiable expense for running a small program.

[00:28:43] <alzgh> `find -name access.log* |grep -hr 500 -` I expect this to read the file names piped by find from stdin, but it does not. Removing the dash at the end does the trick. I'm not sure why that is. Man pages say `-` makes it read from stdin.
[00:28:55] <emanuele6> i think they want you to use `go run` only for testing and to compile the program to actually run it

[02:15:23] <FightingFalcon> whats wrong this : if [[ "$file" != "*.{filepart,png,svg}" && ( "$action" == "CREATE" || "$action" == "MOVED_TO" ) ]]
[02:15:23] *** Joins: shush (sid21719@id-21719.tinside.irccloud.com)
[02:15:25] <Nintendo> That would require waiting around for the command to finish, though, which would make the whole point of exec moot.
[02:15:38] <shush> Is there a way to know if a script is being "sourced" from another shell?
[02:15:44] <Nintendo> In other words, it might be nice if there were magic.
[02:15:47] <shush> I'd like to exit if it isn't

[02:16:23] <greybot> shush: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/109 -- How can I tell whether my script was sourced (dotted in) or executed?
[02:16:32] <FightingFalcon> why *.@ _

[02:16:39] <greycat> !extglob > FightingFalcon 
[02:16:39] <greybot> FightingFalcon: "Extended globs" (shopt -s extglob) allow you to say things like "all files that do not end in .jpg". See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob
[02:16:40] <twkm> "$file" is okay.  "pattern" turns it into a plain text match.
[02:17:09] <greycat> the *. is a regular glob.  the @(...) is an extended glob.

[02:18:21] <FightingFalcon> twkm, how about "$action" ?
[02:20:33] <FightingFalcon> $file != "*.@(filepart|png|svg)"
[02:20:37] <FightingFalcon> this is also not working

[02:22:10] <greycat> !noquote
[02:22:10] <greybot> Quotes on expansions are almost always safest, even if sometimes unnecessary. The ONLY times you do NOT want quotes: ${var:+ .. } (quote expansions inside '..', though!), right-hand side of [['s = and =~ (if you want a pattern match), inside arithmetic context (( "$foo" )) -> (( foo )).

[09:01:34] <greybot> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and be patient waiting for an answer. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/NetEtiquette
[09:08:32] <joebobjoe> how do I parse https://termbin.com/jg3r into just the usernames separated by a new line using sed?
[09:08:36] *** Quits: killown (~killown@user/killown) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:09:21] <phy1729> Have you considered using /who instead?
[09:09:45] <joebobjoe> yea but it's too late for that now
[09:09:55] <joebobjoe> because now I want to use it with the data I already got
[09:10:08] <joebobjoe> I tried sed -n 's/\[\(.*?\)\]/\1/p' freenode
[09:10:22] <joebobjoe> (where freenode is the file that user list is stored in)
[09:11:12] <phy1729> Honestly I'd load it into vim, visual block delete the first 6 cols and then replace [[@]] with nothing
[09:11:42] <phy1729> Technically incorrect since those can showup in nicks, but it works here
[09:12:08] <joebobjoe> what do you mean replace [[@]] with nothing
[09:12:21] <phy1729> :%s/[][@]//g
[09:12:23] <joebobjoe> so just do vim-foo?
[09:12:55] <phy1729> yeah for a one off with a really shitty data format it's faster
[09:13:08] <joebobjoe> whoah wtf did :%s/[][@]//g do
[09:13:10] <joebobjoe> it worked
[09:14:17] <phy1729> https://envs.sh/Oh.txt
[09:15:04] <joebobjoe> can you explain [][@]?
[09:15:10] <joebobjoe> where do I find it in the vim help?
[09:15:23] <phy1729> it's a character class matching ] [ or @
[09:15:33] <phy1729> vim help really belongs in #vim
[09:17:00] <joebobjoe> ok thanks
[09:17:15] <joebobjoe> didn't think to read it like [ ... ]
[09:19:15] <joebobjoe> I sure dislike when I google "posix sed manual" the old version comes up
[09:19:15] <derpadmin> i'm late to the party but
[09:19:15] <derpadmin> sed 's/[(0-9{2})\:(0-9{2}\ |\[|\ ]//g' file | sed 's/\]/\n/g'
[09:19:31] <joebobjoe> thanks! I'll try it
[09:19:48] <joebobjoe> it kind of works but there are blank lines
[09:19:54] <joebobjoe> I'll study it though
[09:20:16] <joebobjoe> derpadmin: this looks very messy 
[09:20:24] <joebobjoe> can't be a complainer lol
[09:20:53] <derpadmin> sed 's/[(0-9{2})\:(0-9{2}\ |\[|\ ]//g' file | sed 's/\]/\n/g' | sed '/^$/d'
[09:20:56] <joebobjoe> oh you keep the ] characters so you can replace them with newlines
[09:21:50] <derpadmin> joebobjoe, it does what you asked for, with sed only
[09:22:23] <joebobjoe> oh I see you select everything except the usernames and remove it rather than print them
[09:22:28] <phy1729> fwiw when people give a question using X, you can ignore the using part
[09:22:30] <phy1729> !using
[09:22:30] <greybot> "How can I do X using Y?" NEVER ask a question of that form. Y may not be the best way to do X. All you should ask is, "How do I do X?"
[09:22:50] <joebobjoe> but I'm asking to learn the tool
[09:23:48] <Nintendo> If you asked how to loosen a bolt using a hammer, would you still be asking to learn the tool?
[09:27:30] <joebobjoe> derpadmin: why do you put in the vertical bars?
[09:27:55] <Nintendo> !pipe
[09:27:55] <greybot> (Anonymous) pipes use the | character to connect the standard output of one command to the standard input of another. Each command is executed in a subshell (but see !subshell, !lastpipe, !faq 24).

[13:04:50] <emanuele6> or simply use a whileread loop instead of a for so that you don't need to set IFS
[13:04:52] <emanuele6> !whileread
[13:04:52] <greybot> A while loop that reads line-by-line: while IFS= read -r line; do something "$line"; done ## See https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001 for details.

[13:09:10] <MaximB> whats is the correct way to add sort -d to this command so it would be sorted at the output file?   sed "s/,/ /g" $rec_file > $rec_file".tmp"

[13:10:25] <obiwahn>  every time i write bash script i make dump mistakes but the others in our company are far worse. So i think go might be easier for some tasks.
[13:11:15] <obiwahn> sed "s/,/ /g" $rec_file | sort -d > $rec_file".tmp"
[13:11:58] <obiwahn> sed can operate inplace with `-i` if you do not need the file later.
[13:12:09] <MaximB> ho... and I thought there would be tricks like " " () etc...
[13:12:55] <obiwahn> $rec_file".tmp" should probably be "$rec_file.tmp". Otherwise it is broken if the filename contains spaces
[13:13:00] <MaximB> obiwahn yeah I know about  "-i" many ppl in this channel hate this option ;)  
[13:13:25] <MaximB> thanks
[13:13:54] <obiwahn> I use it a lot if i need to modify lots of code. It is probably hated because it is not everywhere available.
[13:14:41] <MaximB> sed not available everywhere? 
[13:14:43] <obiwahn> well if i have to work with a mac the first thing i do is to install a proper bash along with gnu awk, sed, find :P
[13:15:38] <obiwahn> There is the gnu version and regular/bsd. The non gnu do not support `-i` afaik.
[13:16:10] <obiwahn> there are only a few tools that really matter. probably just the named ones plus `nc`
[13:18:56] <obiwahn> emanuele6: the argument about compiling and linking go is imo wrong. After the first run there is the compiled version in $TMP and as long as the code does not change running the 'go script' is really fast.

[19:39:29] <xheimlich> I basically have a sequence of python scripts for ML stuff. This is early stage / exploratory. Some of it is ready to go (using Pydantic for BaseSettings so options can be bypassed via env vars when running docker container), some of it is rough.

[19:41:19] <xheimlich> so I keep doing python this && python that && python thatzazz. But sometimes only want to run this or that. It makes more sense to write a small bash script that asks me "do this time-consuming thing again y/n".

[20:10:35] <xheimlich> I'm doing something like "if timeout 20s whiptail --yesno "Yes or no" 20 60; then echo Yes!; fi" appears to work but exits with its own status code, botching the if clause.

[20:11:45] <xheimlich> yes, I'm reading documentation.

[21:39:30] <OMGOMG> sure. try cut or awk
[21:40:13] <tirnanog> consider using ps -ef, along with the -o option to specify the fields of interest.

[22:16:43] <twkm> though "hiding" columns is entirely -o.  no need to purport that -ef or -A is needed too.

[22:19:54] <tirnanog> on the contrary, that aux was given implies that -A would be desirable. otherwise, the process selection behaviour will change markedly.
[22:21:21] <tirnanog> had it not been given, I would not have mentioned any other option than -o.
