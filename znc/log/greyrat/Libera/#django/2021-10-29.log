[00:06:22] <prsn> hi! can someone help me understand what AlterModelOptions is really doing? i tried adding a test migration that just has a RunPython that prints <Class>._meta.__dict__ and it seems to just take the values from the code, totally disregarding a preceding AlterModelOptions
[00:06:55] <prsn> the docs say that AlterModelOptions is specifically intended to make changes readable by RunPython migrations, but what code can i put in my RunPython to see those changes?

[00:29:44] <prsn> FunkyBob: thanks! how can i access the ProjectState instance from my RunPython migration?
[00:30:25] <prsn> (and under what circumstances would a normally-created migration do so?)
[00:34:01] <FunkyBob> honestly, had never heard of this operation until you mentioned it

[00:36:52] <FunkyBob> it seems state.apps is what's passed to the RunPython callback as its first argument
[00:41:12] <prsn> oh, that actually is exactly what i needed to tie the pieces together, thanks. i still don't fully understand when this would matter outside of a custom RunPython, but i can at least directly see how it's behaving now

[08:55:36] <humanBird> Attempting adding Reactjs to django has been a futile effort.   I've seen a few different approaches:  1.  do everything in nodejs and django/python land completely separate using CORS (not possible because i'm using 3rd party monolithic django app and need to add some front end stuff).  2.  create a completely new app with just reactjs in it and
[08:55:37] <humanBird> somehow use views from that.  3.  messing around with static/webpack  and copying files here or there.
[08:56:06] <humanBird> I can't seem to figure out how to add the app i created using create-react-app into django. it's like django is resisting this effort...

[10:48:45] <dminuoso> Part of the trick is to just accept that there's no sensible automagic integration between whatever JS builder tools you use and django, and just build it yourself.
[10:48:48] <dminuoso> It's not even a lot of work.
[10:49:45] <dminuoso> humanBird: All these tools, like webpack, have a way of communicating generated files via what's commonly referred to as manifest file, which are usually just some JSON with a bunch of references.

[10:51:18] <dminuoso> So you could just hook into webpack, and just generate some django template automatically based off that manifest file.

[10:52:03] <dminuoso> Such that each time you modify the react components, this will cause webpack to regenerate the bundle, regenerate the manifest file, and then with your slim code regenerate that template file, and everything will just work out
[10:54:31] <dminuoso> So really it just boils down to having some `js_assets` directory, which your JS bundler tooling will compile and turn into some bundle with map files and everything, and then a simple tool hook (or a wrapper script) that will turn the manifest file into a Django template.
[10:54:42] <dminuoso> For us it took like half an hour to build?
[10:54:52] <dminuoso> That was including looking up documentation

[11:03:50] <pycode1> hello everybody i have a modelform why when i do {{ form.as_p }} it does not create the "id" hidden fields?
[11:03:53] <pycode1> field*
[11:04:03] *** Joins: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex)
[11:04:13] <pycode1> i tried with Class Meta: fields = ('id', 'company_name',)
[11:04:16] <pycode1> but i do not see it
[11:04:23] <pycode1> do i force it manually?
[11:05:29] <pycode1> i am also passing the "instance" on that form
[11:08:25] <Lartza> pycode1, You likely can't access it from the form since there's little point to, as it can't be changed
[11:08:39] <Lartza> But I'm not entirely sure, just woke up too so can't think straight
[11:09:20] <Lartza> If you need the id for something, don't use ModelForm
[11:10:05] <Lartza> Also no, it can't create the id field either, because the database does that
[11:10:08] <pycode1> Lartza, because i see that django is adding new record
[11:10:17] <pycode1> i need to update the previous one
[11:10:23] <pycode1> no no i do not want to create
[11:10:25] <Lartza> What do you mean update?
[11:10:32] <pycode1> i need to update the record of the db
[11:10:36] <pycode1> so i need the id for that reason
[11:10:43] <pycode1> to update instead of creating
[11:11:49] <pycode1> Lartza, as i wrote i am passing the instance
[11:11:59] <pycode1> but for some reason django is creating

[11:19:36] <pycode1> yeah
[11:19:41] <pycode1> i pass the instance like that
[11:20:09] <pycode1> hmm but i suppose there is something else because i am using some other nested formset

[14:41:50] <pycode1> it works
[14:41:54] <pycode1> but looks bad :D
[14:44:25] <moldy> __init__() might not be the best place to do this
[14:44:45] <pycode1> i know but i have a special field that let me understand the number of elements i need to manage
[14:44:46] <moldy> but if you must do it there, self.data should work, yes
[14:45:06] <pycode1> moldy, https://bpa.st/26EA
[14:45:24] <pycode1> SplitArrayField needs "size" parameter
[14:45:33] <pycode1> so i added the feature_count hidden field
[14:45:43] <pycode1> and then i need to read it to set the size parameter
[14:45:45] <pycode1> https://bpa.st/26EA#1L14

[18:08:04] <pycode1> i then need to check if that pricelist exists or not,
[18:08:17] <pycode1> so i must query the PRiceList table to check if the id exists
[18:09:32] <GinFuyou> Yeah, you probably want to check that early
[18:09:50] <pycode1> GinFuyou, but where exactly? dispatch ?
[18:09:56] <pycode1> and then raise the exception from there?
[18:10:45] <pycode1> i see the dispatch also raise HttpResponseNotAllowed so i think i can raise a notfoudn 404 from dispatch too
[18:11:01] <GinFuyou> Dunno, I don't see your code? dispatch is usually last resort in my experience, but surely sometimes it's just the right place
[18:11:26] <GinFuyou> technically there is nothing wrong using dispatch
[18:11:47] <pycode1> GinFuyou, it is a simple CBV
[18:11:48] <pycode1> https://bpa.st/7JLQ
[18:12:07] <pycode1> and now i have to add the check on the "pricelist"
[18:12:17] <graingert[m]> is there a cheap way to add a data- to a django form?
[18:12:31] <pycode1> because then i need to do form.instance.pricelist = pricelist inside the form_valid()
[18:12:41] <pycode1> so i need the pricelist instance
[18:12:58] <pycode1> for that reason i have create a class attribute called pricelist, i will save there the instance
[18:13:03] <graingert[m]> eg so it renders `<form data-url={...} .. >`

[19:14:10] <Stench> "several" meaning "a few dozen" :P

[19:38:25] <doismellburning> Stench: I think it very much depends on your use-case and overall needs!
[19:39:34] <doismellburning> Stench: but without further context, I'd probably start off with the media API (probably looking at direct-to-S3 uploads) and run a workflow off that
[19:44:23] <Stench> doismellburning: hm... that might be best because there will be screenshots involved. Would that workflow be like, once the upload is detected, i hit an API endpoint to trigger the ingestion check?
[19:44:35] <Stench> (from the S3 upload workflow, for example?)

[20:24:30] <humanBird> so yea... turns out CRA (create react app) has grown into a monstrous bloat of software.  I don't just run some webpack command and get a javascript file to embed on the page.  I have to sort through thousands of lines of config and remove things like a11y(accessibility) and SASS and deal with chunkify things.  You don't just <script> something on
[20:24:31] <humanBird> a template and are done.

[20:25:21] <humanBird> why is accesibility even a concern of a javascript/css/html framework.  You at least need the operating system to run a screen reader.  this is ridiculous to add to something like reactjs

[20:57:28] <humanBird> the screen reader is for sight impaired people to use your website.  like siri.  when you press the TAB key on your keyboard, the reader reads whatever element the browser has focus on.
[20:58:13] *** Quits: segfaultbanana (~segfaultb@user/segfaultbanana) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:58:28] <hylje> and that element, and its orientation, features, whatever else come from the framework that creates it
[20:58:29] *** Joins: segfaultbanana (~segfaultb@user/segfaultbanana)
[20:59:04] <humanBird> it has minimal relevance with what a front end "framework" should concern itself with.
[21:00:11] <humanBird> these are non functional concerns like security/performance etc.   When i want to add something a little more interactive instead of just fully server rendered pages that django provides,  i don't want to be sorting through thousands of lines of configuration to delete such things
[21:00:16] <nedbat> humanBird: have you heard of aria attributes?
[21:00:37] <humanBird> i've done accessibility testing extensively... this doesn't belong in a linter
[21:01:18] <nedbat> humanBird: linting is for checking all sorts of code quality concerns.  Why not a11y?
[21:02:06] <humanBird> it's a testing concern that doesn't belong in a front end framework, it's bloat
[21:02:41] <humanBird> why not add an owasp tool that checks for cross site scripting while they are at it?
[21:02:49] <hylje> there's only so much the screen reader's heuristics can do to decipher an interactive app
[21:03:44] <hylje> that's why the app should give the screen reader a leg up telling it what its parts do, so the screen reader and the human using it can have a good time
[21:04:39] <humanBird> i think we are talking about two different things.  front end frameworks shouldn't have to deal with all of that.  And it can't do it properly anyways. It's just dipping its toes in the water.
[21:05:04] <hylje> the front-end framework creates the thing that the screen reader tries to make sense of
[21:05:57] <humanBird> and there are many more accesibility concerns that a linter just doesn't find.  it doesn't care if there's a "jump to content" or not
[21:06:12] <nedbat> humanBird: how does this relate to Django?
[21:06:51] <humanBird> the difficulty in adding such a front end framework to django is compounded not only by static files but bloat
[21:07:38] <humanBird> anyways.  adding reactjs to a previously existing django app has been a poor experience to say the least.

[21:10:43] <humanBird> i've got these generated javascrpt files that look like: runtime-main.02df68b.js and some css files that look the same.  trying to shove this into static directories is completely non working.
[21:11:43] <humanBird> it seems as though the entire django opinion is to "use DRF and do all your front end stuff somewhere else"
