[14:14:12] <dayday> You half British half Norwegian mutt. With a horrible British accent.
[14:14:51] <dayday> He reminds me. It was a long time ago. It was a confirmation trip with Church and we went to this small town called Voss an hour or two outside of Bergen by train.
[14:15:03] <dayday> We got drunk and decided to take the party downtown. Everything was closed. It was snowing and the roads were covered with ice. Then one of us managed to get in touch with some locals who invited us to a party.
[14:15:25] <dayday> It started off cheerful, but a lot of them didn't like me because for one I'm only half Norwegian (my father is Malay/Orang Asli), and second I was with the only girl there.
[14:15:36] <dayday> So their leader came up to me with a beer bottle and was like "Don't you even move a single muscle." I was like 17, he was like 27.
[14:15:41] <dayday> They ended up chasing us away. Until all of a sudden we ran into a large NATO convoy of British soldiers. We told them what happened and they wern't having none of it. "Should we care of it?" they asked. We politely declined, and they drove us back in their tanks to the school where we camped.
[14:15:43] <dayday> Good times!

Its proposed 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) height, 6-kilometre-wide (3.7 mi) sea-base, and 800-floor capacity could accommodate 500,000 to 1,000,000 inhabitants. This structure would be composed of over 3,000,000 tons of steel.
