[02:42:56] <Guest7160> Hello, I am planning on upgrading to an oled monitor, but am not sure if there will be any problems. How is hdr and 10bit on linux? Is there anything else I should know?
[02:43:01] <jim87> Hello! I'm developing a tool to mount partitions, in Python. I'm using the libc library's mount function with the following parameters: (source, target, 'nfs', 0, ''), but it fails mounting (return value -1, errno: 22, which should be wrong parameters). If I try to mount it in terminal via `mount -t nfs source target` though it correctly mounts... what am I doing wrong? Thank you :)
[02:43:37] <ayecee> your arguments, which we can't see from here, are invalid

[02:44:17] <jim87> ayecee: I can share you the source and target variables, but they're the same between the terminal command and the libc call
[02:44:28] <ayecee> apparently they're not
[02:45:04] <ayecee> oh wait
[02:45:27] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[02:45:32] <ayecee> the mount command calls mount.nfs, which may do something other than simply passing the arguments verbatim to mount
[02:45:51] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[02:46:38] <ayecee> you might compare your mount syscall to the one you'd see from strace of the command
[02:46:56] <jim87> ayecee: good idea, will try the strace :)

[15:17:01] <alekksander> or i move one of the raid disks to another computer
[15:17:04] <djph> RAID goes "below" the filesystems.
[15:17:14] <djph> i.e. you have to RAID first, then LUKS / LVM on top
[15:18:15] <alekksander> then can connect one of the mirrored disks to another pc, and open it with my passphrase there?
[15:18:23] <djph> no
[15:18:33] <ananke> yes
[15:18:39] <djph> You'd need the raid controller too
[15:18:47] <ananke> not with linux software raid
[15:19:00] <djph> ... oh, right ... people actually do that.
[15:19:13] <ananke> yes, for that exact purpose: portability
[15:19:15] <djph> granted, mdadm wasn't specified, just "RAID"
[15:19:34] <alekksander> mdadm is the only tool i know for this ;) forgot to mention, sry
[15:20:01] <ananke> indeed, though 'mdadm' is just a front-end utility, not the actual concept/technology of software raid in linux
[15:20:11] <tomreyn> there is hardware raid, too (and other software raids)
[15:20:26] <sunny93> I know hard links are only valid with same filesystem. But I wonder can an hard link cross different paritition with same file system?
[15:20:27] <djph> alekksander: yeah, usually when I come across RAID, it's done in hardware.  Hence my initial 'no'
[15:20:35] <joo> ananke, thanks ! :-)
[15:20:51] <djph> sunny93: by definition, "different partitions" are not "the same filesystem"

[16:19:48] <katp32> not sure how it works for ZIP, but with TAR using FUSE is kind of just dumb due to the fact that the entire archive has to be decompressed first anyways in order to read the contents, so you'd be better of just extracting it, which is why squashfs is a thing, but whatever

[17:47:59] <katp32> ok, 1) Tor is complicated, look up the Tor website, they have good explanations I'm sure 2) VPNs do NOT improve your privacy beyond hiding your traffic from your ISP. your VPN provider can still see what you're doing, and web tracking is pretty much completely unaffected
[17:48:01] <Dagmar> gladys: Well, a couple of reasons.  First off, the browser that it ships with is sort fo a crippled version of Firefox that doesn't "do" javascript to a degree that those vectors for information leakage are dead.  The other is that you wind up appearing to come from a different IP address with _each transaction_ so it becomes nearly impossible to track someone unless they're allowing cookies to everywhere

[17:55:14] <tomreyn> katp32: because rfc7686
[17:55:55] <Dagmar> gladys: Basically, when you publish an onion address, your end picks a few "introduction points", gins up a key, and signs them to generate a hash that's sent to the global directory
[17:56:21] <Dagmar> gladys: So basically, anyone connecting to your onion address only connects to _those_ systems and they tunnel back to you
[17:56:27] <ayecee> that rfc registers the .onion domain, which is pretty cool, but i think he's talking about something like an .onion domain without being one
[17:56:31] <katp32> ayecee: onion domains are basically just public keys with a DHT that maps those keys to an IP address (not really since Tor obviously doesn't use IP addresses internally but you get the point). there's no reason that can't be done on the clearnet as well, for distributed domain names
[17:56:38] <katp32> and it's she

[17:58:09] <Dagmar> gladys: Being that each side of that is ultimately passing through three other hosts (because literally, "onion") it's generally pretty solid, although slow
[17:58:18] <ayecee> dns via dht, okay. you'd still have the ip address of the endpoint in that scenario, i guess.
[17:58:22] <katp32> the benefit would be not relying on a single centralized DNS registry :P
[17:59:05] <ayecee> i wonder if such a thing exists
[17:59:21] <ayecee> like it would make dns names a pain to type out, but still
[17:59:27] <katp32> closest thing I've heard of is namecoin, which is blockchain grossness so..
[18:00:03] <katp32> it would be annoying to type yeah, but it would at least have one major advantage over just using IP addresses in that you could then change the IP address of your server without interrupting service

[18:02:11] <katp32> yeah, it'd be distributed DNS for the sake of distributed DNS, not for privacy

[18:05:02] <katp32> eh, it might actually be easier to remember, you'd need more characters in total but humans don't remember english words as a series of characters anyways so that doesn't really matter

[19:13:53] <hexnewbie> When the iptables utility create nft rules for you, you would not spend the time to rewrite *yet another* part of system scripts so you can upgrade.

[20:21:00] <Dagmar> ...just to have a second look at whether the drive is dead or not
[20:21:10] <hexnewbie> mattf: Yeah, checking it on another machine may rule out a problem at the USB host

[20:21:17] <Dagmar> earendel: Let me say again, this is _exactly_ what sudo was designed to facilitate
[20:21:20] <mattf> (i already checked on other machien)
[20:21:39] <Dagmar> earendel: You do not need to give them the ability to run every command they can think of through sudo.
[20:21:48] <Dagmar> That's the ham-fisted way to use sudo.
[20:21:59] <hexnewbie> mattf: Did the other machine work or also error out?
[20:22:04] <Dagmar> You _can_ tell sudo that only the command "ifup eth3" is allowed
[20:22:13] <mattf> it didn't work on the other machine
[20:22:13] <mattf>  
[20:22:24] <earendel> unless i can configure sudo to do just that. which i probably can, but i didn't seem to be intuitively able to configure that.
[20:22:33] <earendel> i see.
[20:22:33] <earendel> i thought groups would be able to do just that as well.
[20:22:36] <Dagmar> Then it's _dead_ and the only thing you can do is replace it
[20:22:39] <earendel> like put that user into a group. done.

[20:58:48] <bignose> Hello. So this morning I connected to a Centos8 machine in single user mode, to adust the MAC address of an interface because the motherboard had been swapped. And /etc/sysconfig didn't exist. Is that cause systemd didn't create it at boot, because of single user mode? When we rebooted in multiuser mode, it was back again

[22:03:32] <Dan39> i'm playing with some embedded arm linux, new vs old systems, something i'm investigating is why sshd takes a long time to start, which comes down to functions it uses for security stuff obviously needing a certain level of entropy available, and sshd won't start until /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail hits 125

[22:04:41] <Dan39> well, on the new one it takes a good 30 seconds often, on the old one it starts in like 1 second. it's interesting that on the new one i see entropy_avail start at like 1 and climb up slowly, but on the old one it sits at 0 until i start sshd, then it jumps to 125 instantly and slowly climbs from there. what gives?
[22:04:45] <z023> Dan39 wow
[22:04:47] <kuhilas> xrandr --output HDMI-A-0 --auto --output eDP --right-of HDMI-A-0 --auto --pos 1920x50  <- the --pos is not working. The right monitor aswell as the left one are 1920x1080 and after running that command and then running plain xrandr command it says eDP connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 194mm  .. The screen 0 says current 3840 x 1080 ..so do I have to increase that total 1080 somehow first?

[23:43:23] <hexnewbie> gladys: gdisk is a partition editor for GPT, created when util-linux fdisk didn't support those yet, by a different author
[23:44:00] <VMGuy23> Also what does the FULL 100.00% mean on the bottom bar
[23:44:25] <ayecee> i mean how many ways are there to interpret that?
[23:44:28] *** Joins: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe)
[23:44:43] <hexnewbie> gladys: It supports some GPT-specific features. For example, I'm not sure I was able to find where to change the partuuid of a partition, which I suspect is required (though I have only limited circumstantial evidence) to grow mount partitions
[23:44:55] <VMGuy23> its between the Ethernet and storage sections
[23:45:01] <hexnewbie> gladys: I mean, I wasn't able to find that in fdisk
[23:45:16] <gmcastil> Dagmar, so when you say "the order they do it in..." are you referring to the order they do it after they've entered the chroot environment (e.g., the so-called 2nd pass) ?
[23:45:26] *** Joins: neshpion (~neshpion@gateway/tor-sasl/neshpion)

[23:46:16] <Dagmar> What do you think is going to happen if you're building for an alien architecture, and then you chroot into that new filesystem and try and do anything
[23:46:35] <ayecee> and thereby try to run programs for an alien architecture
[23:46:49] <hexnewbie> Has anyone mentioned qemu yet?
[23:46:52] <sh4> gmcastil, if you build a crosscompiler all components will be linked against host libc - and the libc you need for the target will be built for the target
[23:47:08] <sh4> (using cross-gcc and cross-binutils)
[23:47:52] <kveroneau> I also found with qemu-user-static, you can actually use Docker to effortless run ARM containers on Intel/AMD processors.
[23:48:00] *** Joins: tolland (~tolland@138.197.109.178)
[23:48:08] <gmcastil> Dagmar, i never suggested the notion of entering a chroot on my host system or trying to run cross-compiled binaries on my host system
[23:48:11] <kveroneau> Making it much easier to create a full ARM environment on your PC for cross-compiling.
[23:48:34] <gmcastil> kveroneau, yes, i'm aware of that - i'm just trying to understand the steps to go through to build a cross-compilation environment in general
[23:48:37] <ayecee> oh yeah, way easier that way, turns it into a native compile with less gotchas
[23:48:38] <gladys> i dont understand docker. it sounds like a chroot and vm to me kinda
[23:48:40] <kveroneau> And Docker with qemu-user-static is much lighter than a full qemu-system-arm emulation.
[23:48:42] <gladys> with the img
[23:48:48] <Dagmar> gmcastil: Then why would what they do after they enter the chroot have _any_ relevance to cross-compiling?

[23:49:47] <Dagmar> I'm saying point blank that if you're trying to build for an alien architecture and you do not understand how all the pieces work well enough to "just know" what to do, follow the order in which LFS compiles their bootstrap
[23:49:59] <Dagmar> THey are effectively doing the _exact_ same thing you're trying to do.
[23:50:14] <Dagmar> That they're doing x86-to-x86 matters about 0.0001%

[23:50:37] <[twisti]> is there any production ready file system with block deduplication ?
[23:50:40] <sh4> i'd rather suggest to look at musl-cross scripts which is especially targetting cross-compiles, while LFS targets native builds
[23:50:58] <[twisti]> or heck, even file level dedup
[23:51:12] <XJ8> Define production ready
[23:51:19] <ayecee> ready for production
[23:51:23] <gmcastil> Dagmar, still not sure which portion you're referring to - and its that "just know" part i'm trying to understand

[23:52:25] <neshpion> sigma
[23:52:29] <ayecee> [twisti]: does it have to be inline deduplication, or is out-of-band dedup okay?
[23:52:33] <XJ8> Entrust is a very difficult thing. Never trust anything.
[23:52:46] * neshpion doesn't trust XJ8
[23:52:55] <[twisti]> ayecee: meaning the difference between live dedup or dedup as like a cron task ?
[23:53:00] <gmcastil> sh4, well gcc can compile for arm out of the box, so can't i just cross-compile that way?
[23:53:06] <ayecee> because ZFS does inline (with huge memory requirements), btrfs can do out of band. yes, like that.
[23:53:25] <[twisti]> then out of band (that would be cron-ish, right ?) would be fine for me
[23:53:33] <sh4> gcc on what host arch, gmcastil ? also you mentioned a "not yet existing" arch
[23:53:41] <ayecee> great. well, those are pretty much your options there.
[23:54:19] <[twisti]> i was going to look at btrfs anyways, thanks

[23:54:22] <gmcastil> sh4, arm is fine - cant i just tell the make build flow to target arm and let it create arm binaries?
[23:54:22] <gladys> is zfs overkill for home nas
[23:54:30] <ayecee> no
[23:54:30] <sh4> if you just want a compiler for arm, you can build a cross-compiler in 10 minutes using musl-cross-make
[23:54:39] <sh4> no, you need an arm-targetting cross-compiler
[23:54:44] <gladys> it uses a lot of rm
[23:54:45] <ayecee> gladys: but probably don't use the dedup feature for that.

[23:54:51] <gmcastil> sh4, yeah, i'm trying to do things in general without just using someone else's recipe
[23:54:57] <gladys> oh okay is dedup what causes the ram use?
[23:54:59] <ayecee> the dedup is the part that consumes the most ram
[23:55:13] <sh4> gcc doesn't support "multi-arch", i.e. a compiler that can emit both arm and x86 binaries
[23:55:14] <gmcastil> sh4, oh, that's a new piece of information - can you elaborate more?  i thought the compiler could be set for various target architectures
[23:55:34] <sh4> you need a separate gcc for each arch
[23:56:02] <hexnewbie> gladys: If I recall correctly, the entire hash of sha-to-disk-block is held in memory.
[23:56:04] <sh4> they are usually prefixed with the target triple, like arm-eabi-gcc
[23:56:21] <hexnewbie> gladys: And by ‘hash’ I mean ‘hash table’
[23:56:31] <ayecee> and by hash table, i mean a table of hashes
[23:56:51] <sh4> you should really read the musl-cross scripts to understand the process of building a crosscompiler, it's not trivial
[23:56:54] <Dagmar> Okay.  I thought he was actually aware of how this actually worked
[23:56:59] <hexnewbie> And by table of hashes, I mean a thing with four legs, sometimes three, you put the hashes on.

[23:57:20] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: And you use a ruler if you want strictly-ordered hashes

[23:57:58] <sh4> gmcastil, no - you can build a cross-compiler that compiles form arm on your x86, or you can use that one to build a native arm-to-arm compiler
[23:58:07] <sh4> but you always need a crosscompiler first
[23:58:07] <Dagmar> Then you use that to _create_ a gcc binary that can _run_ on ARM
[23:58:20] <ayecee> it's compilers all the way down

[23:58:37] <Dagmar> "If and only if" it was compiled to create binaries for ARM
[23:58:40] <ayecee> gmcastil: a cross-compiling gcc can run on x86 and build for arm, yes
[23:58:42] <sh4> arm-eabi-gcc can do that, yeah, but that's not your stock gcc
[23:58:52] <gmcastil> ah, ok, that makes more sense
[23:59:03] <Dagmar> Generally it just sticks extra bits in your filesystem and calls the relevant parts when you use a different target
[23:59:24] <gmcastil> so i would need to use my x86 GCC to build an x86-to-ARM cross compiler to run on my x86 arch and generate ARM binaries to run on my ARM platform then
[23:59:29] <Dagmar> .,..but like no one ships a compiler with the parts for building for alien platforms already done
[23:59:38] <sh4> afaik llvm can be built in a way to support multiple target archs from the same binary, but i never tried that
