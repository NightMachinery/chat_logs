[00:10:21] <FlorianBad> Is it safe to set `font-weight:bold` on a b tag so that I can use b tag for the sole purpose of selecting a thicker font (so the b tag also has `font-family`) ?
[00:10:58] <FlorianBad> sorry, I meat `font-weight:normal`
[00:11:04] <FlorianBad> meant
[00:12:47] <pavonia> Safe in what way?
[00:14:27] <FlorianBad> pavonia: in a way that the default bold characteristics of <b> is disabled so that it becomes a neutral tag just like span, which then allows me to use font-family to make it bold, rather than its natural proprieties
[00:16:53] <pavonia> Yes, I don't think <b> is special in that regard
[00:18:54] <FlorianBad> Well, what troubles me is that there might be a difference between `<b>` and `font-weight:bold', so that maybe `b` is more than just a `span` with `font-weight:bold`

[01:05:32] <hassoon> 'evening
[01:07:37] <hassoon> FlorianBad: why the heck would you want to change the fontWeight of a b tag
[01:07:53] <hassoon> it is supposed to emphasize texr already
[01:08:45] <FlorianBad> hassoon: because of font-family
[01:09:22] <hassoon> i don't get it
[01:09:25] <hassoon> what about fontFamily ?
[01:11:36] <pavonia> I think the font they are selecting for <b> is already thicker, so adding font-weight: bold would make it even bolder
[01:11:53] <pavonia> One could argue that <b> is the wrong markup for such cases
[01:12:51] <hassoon> pavonia: nope, b receives the font-weight:bold; in the user-agent stylesheet, nothing more
[01:13:11] <hassoon> pavonia: if they set another font-weight on the b tag, it just receives that weight
[01:13:51] <pavonia> Well yes, but in that case this is apperantly not wanted
[01:14:13] <hassoon> pavonia: i don't get it, what is not wanted
[01:14:29] <pavonia> A bolder version of the selected font
[01:14:35] <pavonia> *bold
[01:15:48] <hassoon> FlorianBad: anyway a mere span with a font-weight:bold is exactly like a b tag
[01:17:45] <pavonia> hassoon: AFAIU the situation is: * { font-family: Foo; } b { font-family: FooBold; }. Leaving font-weight: bold would make the font bolder than wanted
[01:18:28] <pavonia> because FooBold is already a bold version of Foo
