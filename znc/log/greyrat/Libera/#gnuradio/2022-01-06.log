[00:00:17] <jholtom> Wow! Congrats!
[00:01:55] <patchvonbraun[m]> The new (to me) one isn't quite a direct replacement.  But the SSD from the old one transferred over, and after leaving some lamb entrails on the keyboard as supplication to the BIOS boot settings, it's now working :)
[00:02:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> This one appears to have a Windows system installed on some soldered-in eMMC.  Trying to decide whether to blow that away or not... :)

[03:43:47] <funkylab[m]> Bsabioa: go to the "advanced search" link under the search box, and enter "GNU Radio" in the first field, select "full text and metadata", in the second field select "OR" instead of "AND" and enter "gnuradio", and again select "full text and metadata", go wild
[03:47:08] <funkylab[m]> Generally, we also have an annual conference (last time it was in person, some 350 participants), it's called GRCon, and presenters tell you what they've built with GNU Radio, so maybe go to to https://www.youtube.com/c/GNURadioProject/playlists and look for the GRCon15 to GRCon21 videos
[03:47:46] <funkylab[m]> if you just want to get a feeling for what you *can* do, I've linked to the tutorials first, so read the first chapter which is aptly named "A Brief Introduction to GNU Radio, SDR, and DSP"
[03:47:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> One might reasonably ask the broader question "what has society used radio-centric signal processing for in the last century?"  In the 17 or so years since Gnu Radio's creation, you can bet that there have been applications of Gnu Radio in most if not all of the categories that proceed from the first question...
[03:48:17] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: oj, I really like that spin
[03:48:17] <BSaboia> funkylab[m], thanks. This solves my curiosity
[03:49:28] <BSaboia> patchvonbraun[m], I hope your dessert is tasty. I was wondering if GNU Radio could be used to establish a small broadcast system to my neighbourhood. Just for fun.
[03:49:50] <funkylab[m]> BSaboia: no, GNU Radio itself is only software
[03:49:55] <BSaboia> But it seems to be something else entirely, so I was curious, I will watch the videos
[03:50:07] <funkylab[m]> you still need transmitter hardware that has an interface to GNU Radio, AND you need a license
[03:50:09] <BSaboia> funkylab[m], yeah, I figured it out by reading the basic readme
[03:50:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> Gnu Radio is a specialty programming environment, so it can be used to address nearly the entirety of the (likely infinite) set "interesting and useful things you can do at the intersection of radio hardware and computers".
[03:50:26] <funkylab[m]> and broadcast licenses are not that easy to get 
[03:50:45] <BSaboia> funkylab[m], yeah, but in some countries you might as well go pirate
[03:51:08] <BSaboia> Since the government only issues radio permits for the "comrades"
[03:51:09] <funkylab[m]> You really don't want to do that in the countries where there's Cartels doing that
[03:51:12] <funkylab[m]> just saying
[03:51:28] <BSaboia> funkylab[m], hmm, true
[03:52:11] <funkylab[m]> anyway, you really should *not* be watching the videos, but be reading "A Brief Introduction to GNU Radio, SDR, and DSP" from https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Tutorials
[03:52:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> Foks often approach Gnu Radio like it's "A Radio With a Lot of Knobs", but it's just a programming environment that is "tuned" to the types of programming tasks typical in real-time signal processing, typically involving Software-Defined Radios, but no exclusively.
[03:52:49] <BSaboia> funkylab[m], I read that before asking
[03:52:57] <funkylab[m]> awesome!
[03:52:58] <BSaboia> this: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Guided_Tutorial_Introduction
[03:53:26] <funkylab[m]> excellent, if there's any questions about that, this would be the place to ask!
[03:53:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> It has been used for decidedly-not-radio tasks like Sonar, acoustic signal processing, etc, etc.
[03:56:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Years ago, it was used to help "reboot" a long-dead science probe, ISEE-3, using the not-entirely-wimpy transmitter capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Telescope.
[03:56:48] <Hoernchen_> and it did not in any way cause the collapse!
[03:57:07] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: we should be having a GNU Radio-marshalled audio stream from #gnuradio -> text-to-speech -> Codec2 or OPUS or xHE-AAC -> 256-QAM -> OFDM -> simulated channel -> quantization -> ZeroMQ PUB socket
[03:57:18] <funkylab[m]> for the world to subscribe to our banter
[03:57:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Hoernchen_:No, that was Politics-Defined-Apathy
[03:57:45] <funkylab[m]> Hoernchen_: yes, yes, let me continue using this definitely not collapse-inducing software :)
[03:58:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> When I was there (at Arecibo) I used Gnu Radio for my brief research mission.
[03:59:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> funkylab: It causes CPU collapse sometimes :)

[13:20:53] <linge93[m]> Hi,guys,As shown in GRC above, my receiver uses TX / RX port, but my two antennas are plugged into RX2 port (forgot to change). I observed the spectrum diagram and time domain diagram and found that there was a weak signal (very small)! It's definitely not noise, because when I change the "range" control, the waveform will change, just like connecting the antenna correctly, but the signal is very, very small. I really can't understand. Is
[13:20:53] <linge93[m]> the usrpb210 faulty?
[13:28:08] <Notou[m]> If the two usrps are really close, you can indeed pick up a transmission without anything connected to the port. The port itelf acts as an antenna, just a very bad one.
[13:32:55] <marvinXP> linge93[m]: don't transmit without an antenna connected. You can damage the radio.
[13:44:21] <marvinXP> But yes, anything is an antenna. Strictly speaking some of the signal received was radiated from PCB traces on the USRP board. Most of what you see probably came via the port acting as a shitty antenna though.
[13:44:58] <marvinXP> linge93[m]: *especially* don't increase the power with no antenna connected.
[13:45:22] <marvinXP> modern radios tend to have protection circuitry for high SWR, but I don't know if that applies to SDRs.

[14:11:38] <funkylab[m]> so you don't have to actively worry about that. Don't connect TX to RX without an attenuator, though, there's combinations that might fry your stuff.

[15:12:59] <linge93[m]> In addition, do you think my "USRP south" and "USRP sink" are configured correctly? When I observe the time domain diagram and frequency domain diagram, I find that the amplitude of "out0" is always greater than "out1". When I exchange two usrps as transceivers (the original transmitting device is used as the receiving device and the original receiving device is used as the transmitting device), the amplitude of "out1" is greater than
[15:12:59] <linge93[m]> "out0". Is this the problem of the device?
[15:15:57] <funkylab[m]> might be, might also just be your wireless channel.
[15:16:28] <funkylab[m]> or the LO leakage suppression on one channel working slightly better
[15:16:29] <funkylab[m]> hm
[15:17:12] <funkylab[m]> really meaningless, though, since you have the AGC enabled, which means the averaged levels are hardware-compensated 
[15:17:49] <funkylab[m]> also not sure what `signal1` and `signal2` do, so hard to tell
[15:21:25] <Notou[m]> They probably are the signals frequencies

[15:23:42] <linge93[m]> I think I can try another interface. 
[15:24:50] <funkylab[m]> I don't understand what "try another interface" means?
[15:25:15] <funkylab[m]> Notou[m]: If they are, they make little sense for most of their range. 
[15:25:16] <linge93[m]> Because the center frequency is the same, which is equivalent to the superposition of two signals, the GUI control is also changing the frequencies of signal0 and signal1, but the results are the same
[15:25:27] <funkylab[m]> ah, yeah
[15:25:37] <funkylab[m]> as said, signal1 and signal2's ranges make no sense.
[15:26:00] <funkylab[m]> With a sampling rate of 2 MS/s, you can represent frequencies from -1 MHz to +1 MHz, not from 0 to 10 MHz.
[15:27:00] <funkylab[m]> i.e. the signal source set to frequency = 9.5e6 and sampling rate = 2e6 will produce exactly the same signal as if set to frequency = -0.5e6
[15:27:24] <linge93[m]> Yes, I'm changing it so that it doesn't exceed 1MHz
[15:30:05] <linge93[m]> In fact, I discussed the central frequency setting here yesterday. I set the central frequency interval of the two channels to be less than the sampling rate, but the signals I receive in the two receiving channels are the same (no matter how to change the waveform and frequency of signal0 and signal1), Can't the two channels output the signal corresponding to the center frequency independently?
[15:31:22] <linge93[m]> Can only be filtered? In this case, RFA and RFB cannot be regarded as two completely independent transceivers
[15:33:40] <funkylab[m]> >  Can't the two channels output the signal corresponding to the center frequency independently?
[15:33:40] <funkylab[m]> yes, they can, but only through digital tuning. You need to read the "tuning notes" in the UHD manual!
[15:33:55] <DerekKozel[m]> On the B210 the RFA and B are definitely not independent transceivers.
[15:36:55] <funkylab[m]> (ha, I don't think many would know better than Derek!)
[15:36:55] <funkylab[m]> indeed, there's only one LO, but since the ADCs sample at the master clock rate, and the DDC chains are separate for both channels, you can issue uhd::tune_requests so that the digital part of tuning is different. I'd strongly recommend explicitly setting the master clock rate in that use case, the automatic rate selection is not aware of your intention to do this.

[15:40:15] <linge93[m]> I've never done this before. Do I need to make some changes to b210 through UHD? Are there any good tutorials or manuals
[15:40:17] <DerekKozel[m]> Agreed. Manually set a master clock rate, then manually create a tune_request for each of the GNU Radio USRP Source/sink channels. Another "gottcha", make sure to specify the same device arguments (including the master_clock_rate=50e6 or similar) for both the Source and Sink
[15:40:31] <DerekKozel[m]> Check the documentation tab of the USRP source block. It has an example
[15:40:31] <funkylab[m]> linge, the UHD manual's "tuning notes"
[15:41:17] <DerekKozel[m]> And yes, the USRP manual https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_general.html#general_tuning
[15:41:49] <funkylab[m]> also, 2 MS/s is a very low sampling rate, you can probably just go higher without stressing out a modern PC too much, and then work in the wider Nyquist-bandwidth baseband. That's certainly a waste of CPU cycles, but it might be easier.

[17:17:04] <funkylab[m]> I wish the tense in that sentence was inaccurate

[17:21:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> Btw, I had originally recommended the software appraoch to channelizing to linge93 because the bandwidths were modest, and I didn't want to introduce a new (possibly distracting) concept like programming the DDCs/DUCs.
[17:22:27] <funkylab[m]> yeah, doing this in a wider baseband is definitely the easier choice here, as long as what they do in baseband doesn't become prohibitively complex at the given rate (but that's unlikely, integer resamplers just aren't that hard anymore.)

[17:41:07] <drmpeg> I got a funny feeling nobody has ever done this.
[17:42:03] <funkylab[m]> heh
[17:42:16] <funkylab[m]> so, I did the offset tuning the way you describe
[17:43:01] <funkylab[m]> what I'm right now condused about is where `uhd.tune_request` even comes from; I only find `uhd.tune_request_t` in our python and pybind sources
[17:44:42] <DerekKozel[m]> I do it regularily. I tend to manually specify each part
[17:45:37] <drmpeg> What does "manually" mean?
[17:45:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, I think for B210, the best way to handle the tuning is to use POLICY_MANUAL for everything, and do it all yourself.
[17:47:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: Normally, when UHD tunes, it uses its knowledge of the synthesizer and DDC/DUC to achieve the desired tuning, using a combination of synthesizer and DDC/DUC.  But you can control that manually.
[17:47:49] <DerekKozel[m]> initialize a tune_request object, then set each individual value before using the object
[17:47:50] <drmpeg> In GRC?
[17:47:52] <DerekKozel[m]> Not so convenient in GRC
[17:48:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> For example, most synthesizers have a relatively-coarse step-size.
[17:48:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: That's what the uhd.tune_request() method is for.
[17:49:13] <drmpeg> Right, but where do you do all this "manual" stuff?
[17:49:31] <drmpeg> in GRC
[17:49:37] <DerekKozel[m]> In the generated Python usually, not in GRC
[17:50:05] <DerekKozel[m]> It'd be possible to cram it into a GRC field, but ech not pretty
[17:50:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: You can pass a tune_request in GRC instead of a floating-point value--it gets taken care of.
[17:51:35] <drmpeg> Yes, but that's just (center_freq, offset).

[18:13:34] <drmpeg> So what's the complete solution in GRC?
[18:14:07] <drmpeg> For both channels.

[18:16:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> I THINK
[18:17:17] <DerekKozel[m]> Placed into both RF channel center frequency fields. With the constraint that lo_freq has to be the same on both channels
[18:18:01] <drmpeg> Ok, cool.
[18:18:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: A further constraint being that you have to know what the step-size is of the synthesizer.  So, <lo_freq> has to be on one of those steps, and you'd need to compensate in dsp_freq if it isn't.
[18:18:35] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: problem is: the UHD bindings don't look like they support these keyword args
[18:18:44] <DerekKozel[m]> The B210's Lo step size is really small
[18:19:43] <DerekKozel[m]> so it depends on what your absolute frequency accuracy need is. When I manually write it I often do read back the actual tune_response_t values and alter the DSP_freq accordingly in a second retune
