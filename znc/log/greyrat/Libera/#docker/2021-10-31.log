[03:54:22] <tabakhase> ryanrambharose you make one
[03:54:36] <ryanrambharose> tabakhase where?
[03:54:38] <HaMsTeRs> after half year of waiting, I'm very disappointed with the new mac book 14" m1x .   Even though the screen look very comfortable, but the design of the entire thing is ugly and heavy.   I hold myself not to buy any laptop until this moment.   Now I'm thinking either to go for x1 nano or Mac Pro M1 13".   Both released a year ago, not sure if it's worth to spent the same among as it released.  any suggestion would be appreciated. 
[03:55:18] <ryanrambharose> and where can I find the .env-sample sorry I am very new to docker
[03:55:45] <tabakhase> ryanrambharose kinda wherever - its given to docker to read and hand to the container with that "--env-file" arg - if you wonder what can go in there, guess there github goes alobng with this image, there is a sample https://github.com/laurent22/joplin
[03:56:13] <ryanrambharose> tabakhase thank you very much
[03:57:48] <ryanrambharose> how do i deploy this docker compose file? https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/docker-compose.server.yml

[04:04:21] <ryanrambharose> yes
[04:04:27] <ryanrambharose> it says line 98 error
[04:04:36] <tabakhase> or... did you download the github html or so? whyile trying to save the page? - need to use the "raw" button top right (righclick save-as)
[04:04:39] <ryanrambharose> i used wget to get the file is this correct?
[04:04:42] <ryanrambharose> hmmm

[04:05:50] <ryanrambharose> yes i got it
[04:08:10] <ryanrambharose> how do i
[04:08:11] <ryanrambharose> You must specify POSTGRES_PASSWORD to a non-empty value for the
[04:08:11] <ryanrambharose> db_1   |        superuser. For example, "-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password" on "dock                                                                                                             er run".

[04:08:54] <tabakhase> compose will automatically eat that ".env" file and fill in whats set as environment: in the compose file
[04:09:37] <ryanrambharose> ok which one should i run first 
[04:09:43] <ryanrambharose> the database or joplin
[04:10:19] <tabakhase> that compose file contains both, so your "docke run" you did before is nonsense now =)
[04:10:39] <ryanrambharose> i am lost
[04:10:43] <ryanrambharose> which command should i be using
[04:11:18] <tabakhase> think of docker-compose as a way to "wrap docker commands into a yaml file" - cause as you notice thats a lot nicer to manage than orchestrating 34376 character longh "docker run" commands
[04:11:28] <ryanrambharose> yes
[04:12:33] <ryanrambharose> when i try to run the compose file i get an error asking for a postgres password
[04:12:55] <ryanrambharose> do i edit the compose to include a password?
[04:13:58] <tabakhase> no, the ".env"
[04:14:51] <tabakhase> (the idea would be that the compose file is in git, and you wouldnt want everyone to much around in this to set passwords - so compose consumes a ".env" file in the directory if it exists, and then substitues those values inside the compose "before doing the actual commands"
[04:15:07] <tabakhase> you can try the `docker-compose config` command to see what actually comes out on the end
[04:17:42] <ryanrambharose> app_1  | 2021-10-31 00:47:31: db: Could not connect. Will try again. getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN db
[04:18:02] <tabakhase> once that is all looking dandy, best is to restart from scratch to get that failed-init-attempt gone, so throw a "docker-compose down -v" and then again a up 
[04:18:57] <tabakhase> and for the upstart, give the app some time too, while there is a "depends_on" this only is creation-order, so DB may still be doing the init-proccedure (setup the db, create the user and so on) while app tries to connect
[04:19:18] <tabakhase> usually apps either "wait" for a db with a timeout, or just retry ((as this one should seeing the "restart: unless-stopped"))
[04:19:51] <ryanrambharose> it is still asking for a postgres password

[04:26:27] <ryanrambharose> i have the password set to the default as joplin

[04:27:33] <tabakhase> bit hard remote, but the usuals, comments, weird chars in .env - make sure its ACTUALLY called ".env" not ".env.txt" or some shit :P

[04:45:03] <ryanrambharose> noice
[04:45:43] <ryanrambharose> will this auto start?
[04:47:17] <ryanrambharose> and should i make a directory called joplin containing the .env and compose file
[04:48:38] <tabakhase> "will this autostart" see 'restart: unless-stopped'  (and that counts just YOU doing stop commands, so yea)
[04:50:08] <tabakhase> "dir called joplin" - thats what one would usually do yea - NOTE, docker-compose assembless a "project name" that defaults to the name of the parent directory - and all your containers/volumes/networks and so on get prefixed with this, ((if you were to change that name and want to keep things one can set "-P" or COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME env-vars))
[04:50:33] <tabakhase> given your stack is new, if its named with nonsesne right now, just "down -v" it, move things and make a new one via up

[04:57:55] <ryanrambharose> ok when looking to create new docker images i should be looking for a compose file instead of pulling from docker hub since its easier?
[05:00:49] <BtbN> Uhm, those two things got nothing to do with each other in that way.
[05:00:50] <tabakhase> ryanrambharose no, but also yes :D
[05:00:59] <BtbN> docker-compose will very much still pull from docker hub
[05:01:40] <ryanrambharose> ok...
[05:01:56] <tabakhase> "youd take a image from the hub, craft a docker-run for it, translate that to a compose if you want to keep it around" is kinda the flow, if someone did the compose-step already, the nicer, but its actually pretty easy once you know a little docker, the commands/flags are almost 1:1 the same with a handfull of exceptions
[05:03:22] <ryanrambharose> what is docker-run
[05:04:36] <tabakhase> like you can "translate" your compose file there back to a docker commands, take example DB is a "docker run -e POSTGRES_DB=... -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=... -e POSTGRES_USER=... -p 5432:5432 --restart unless-stopped -v /home/ryan/data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw postgres:13.1"
[05:05:00] <ryanrambharose> got it
[05:05:04] <tabakhase> but you see how sharing the compose with ya is simper than that worm :P

[13:35:23] <ikke> mei: you can specify --user to docker run to use a different user
[13:38:45] <Ether_Man> ikke: Even if you do specify that, if the scripts in the container explicitly run stuff as root, it'll still go back to running as root, as if that root was the host's root if you do that alone. Need to use the uid mapping stuff to map the container root to a different uid outside for that.
[13:39:16] <ikke> Ether_Man: yes, if they use things like sudo to run things as root
[13:39:50] <Ether_Man> Sadly, a lot of containers on docker hub does do that >_<
[13:40:52] <Ether_Man> Then again, they did specify official, though that's a bit ambiguous. If they meant dockerhub official then I think it's unheard of. Though other projects do have official images that do that.

[20:51:04] <FreeBDSM> hello, can I use multistage build in such a way that I first do 1. `FROM alpine AS base` where I just install necessary packages via apk. 2. `FROM golang:alping AS build` where I just build my binary. 3. something like `FROM base` where I use 'base' image from step 1 and basically just copy the binary from step 2?

[20:55:44] *** Joins: sebastianos (~sebastian@user/sebastianos)
[21:00:02] <programmerq> I think that works, but I don't think you gain anything by doing part of the build before the compile and part of it after.
[21:00:42] <programmerq> if you use buildkit, I think it's smart enough to try to run stuff in parallel where possible, so you could just have your builder as the first stage and then the final stage would install the apk packages and then COPY
[21:01:21] <programmerq> not unless there's more to the problem description that you're trying to account for.

[22:15:13] <Sven_vB> hi :) I started a docker container and was surprised that its first action was to install lots of stuff inside. will all of that work be wasted if I stop the container again? is there a way to make it persistend even now that it's already running?
[22:16:15] <jmartin> the state of the container is persisted even if you stop it
[22:16:40] <jmartin> only if you remove and recreate the state is lost
[22:17:12] <jmartin> but the idea of a container is that is effemeral, you normally dont do manual installations on it
[22:17:28] <jmartin> you change the Dockerfile and re-create it

[22:19:11] <programmerq> Sven_vB▸ if you ran a 'docker build' command, then it created an image. containers can be created and use an image for their initial/default filesystem and some configuration like env vars.
[22:19:50] <programmerq> if you did a 'docker run' and the image you specified does a ton of installations, then that's a bit of a weird pattern and it might be worth exploring a different image instead of that one.
[22:20:33] <Sven_vB> programmerq, nope, it was docker run --name gitlab gitlab/gitlab-ce
[22:22:09] <programmerq> ah yeah, the gitlab image does try to do a bunch of stuff at runtime. it's fine for some cases. docker docker stop/start/restart on it won't delete anything. it's if you do a new 'docker run' that you can get a new container. if the stuff it installs goes to a volume, then you can set up a named volume and that can persist between containers if specified.
[22:23:30] <Sven_vB> I see, so if I just "docker stop" it, it's not deleted automatically?
[22:24:03] <Sven_vB> I see the --rm flag to docker run now. I guess that would be required for auto-delete
