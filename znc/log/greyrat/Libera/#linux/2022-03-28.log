[06:00:42] <rbox> gt: sounds like you'll just have to try it and see
[06:00:58] <ayecee> they can't be separated in that sense. you can't provide the discrete gpu to a guest and still use the integrated gpu on the host.

[10:52:26] <letalis> Hello, can someone help me to connect to my uni wifi? I'm using Archlinux with NetworkManager. It worked before when i tried it, this is a new installation now and it's not working anymore. The wifi requires a username/password, and i think it's using 802.1x and no certificate. But when i try to select the connection with nmtui it says "could not activate connection: failed to determine AP security information". Anyone knows how to make this work?

[15:04:52] <terminaldweller> @snshnhns, lol ok
[15:05:02] <alkisg> luva: ubuntu server uses netplan which then uses networkd; you're not supposed to use networkd directly there. Personally I just uninstall netplan, but that's not the "ubuntu way", so wait for someone that uses it

[17:11:19] <Guest80> I am reading it now
[17:11:31] <Dagmar> Squid has become less useful as time has gone by because it can't cache httpd which is what most of everyone's traffic is nowadays
[17:11:45] <Dagmar> s/httpd/https/
[17:11:50] <ananke> also, squid caches in ram too, that's very much the point of it. check your http headers to see if your requests are cached

[17:14:08] <Guest80> For now I just want to make a comment saying how to recreate this problem so a code fix can occur faster
[17:14:34] <Guest80> "When I say page cache it means page cache server, proxy and browser side. Every time you change the content of page, you invalidated every caches that cache the page as whole at every levels. Server side I'm using per-view cache (cache_page on urls)."

[21:07:15] <acegallagher> so, a quick general question. I'm getting very obtuse messages from the kernel in systemd journalctl when running wireguard, "bad scheduling from the idle thread" and when I'm running wg this consumes 100% cpu. wg itself seems unaffected. how can I keep these messages from being logged?
[21:07:27] <acegallagher> so they don't rob me of cpu

[21:08:13] <phreal> Hello. If I copy my whole root directory to a new folder and "chroot" into it from a terminal, can I consider this a safe way to try apps that might contain malicious code? Can I do that instead of using VMs or sandboxing software? Or am I missing something?

[21:10:49] <peetaur> phreal: chroot isolates the fs, but nothing else ... LXC would isolate other stuff too, like network namespace, user namespace, pid namespace, etc.
[21:11:16] <peetaur> a chroot is especially weak if you have mounted things like dev, proc, sys in there
[21:11:20] <alkisg> phreal: the apps won't have access to /proc, /sys, /dev etc; some some apps will run safely, others won't run at all
[21:11:29] <alkisg> And if you do give them access, then you risk things; that's where lxd and VMs come in
[21:11:55] <alkisg> Eh, matrix lags, peetaur already answered :D

[21:12:19] <peetaur> and a VM is the opposite of LXC... LXC separates things within the same kernel, but a KVM would start disconnected and then a bunch of virtual layers connect it again to achive a similar thing
[21:13:01] <peetaur> a VM is probably considered more secure, especially if you have some MAC in there, and disabled stuff you don't need...like some years ago there was a bug found in the floopy disk layer, and even if you have no floppy, it was exploitable

[21:54:47] <phreal> Hi, sorry to bother again but I still have a question if possible. In order to install an app that is not in my distro's repo, I'm downloading the binaries (or compile the source in case binaries are not available) and place the corresponding files in ~/.local/bin ~/.local/share & ~/.local/lib. I added ~/.local/bin to .bashrc to make sure I can run
[21:54:48] <phreal> it from everywhere. I'm looking to run the apps for the local user only.
[21:54:48] <phreal> My questions:
[21:54:49] <phreal> - Is this a correct/traditional approach or does it have downsides?
[21:54:49] <phreal> - Do the binaries in ~/.local/bin access only libs in ~/.local/lib or do they also have access to system libraries? Do they look for libraries relative to where they're located?
