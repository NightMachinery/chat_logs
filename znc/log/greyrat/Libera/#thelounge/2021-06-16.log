[09:49:44] <thelounge0128> Because I checked the install guide, and it only listed Linux variants and the Mac OS.
[09:50:06] <bookworm> as in the app or as in the server software?
[09:50:21] <thelounge0128> The server software
[09:50:42] <bookworm> it's just a JavaScript project, so install node and then use the generic node instructions
