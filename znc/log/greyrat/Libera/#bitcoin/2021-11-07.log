[05:44:07] <linuxmint_> Guest87: Yes, I think so.  So if my 24 word seedphrase is stolen, a thief needs only brute force 1 word (the 25th word) from the BIP-39 word list?
[05:44:31] <Guest87> yes
[05:45:26] <linuxmint_> Guest87: thanks, I found this https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook
[05:46:00] <linuxmint_> Guest87: so a 25th word sounds useless.  Encrypting the seedphrase seems secure and then storing the decryption process in a separate location.

[05:47:59] <Guest87> if you click on ch01.asciidoc that is chapter 1 and so on
[05:48:23] <linuxmint_> Guest87: well, the cold wallet is physical access to bitcoin number1 and number2 is the physical metal seedphrase, so only 1 metal seedphrase is needed.  But apparently needs to be encrypted?

[05:49:45] <Guest87> You can have your seed phrase on a piece of metal sure
[05:49:54] <linuxmint_> Guest87: yes, I understand that. I have found a free option with Bitkey.
[05:50:32] <linuxmint_> Guest87: yes, I've concluded a bolt, nut, 12-24 10mm washers and an engraver/stamp kit is easiest.

[05:51:46] <linuxmint_> The issue I'm finding is, there's so much information, misinformation, disinformation and commercial interests, that the FOSS is buried.

[05:56:08] <Guest87> better to be encrypted than not encrypted
[05:56:15] <linuxmint_> seems so.
[05:56:18] <Guest87> apparently bcvault is more secure than trezor and ledger

[09:34:28] <markasoftware> i'd still trust trezor more than most because it has open source firmware, or just taking an old laptop, removing any wireless connectivity hardware, and installing a minimal, secure open source operating system with basic transaction signing software
[09:36:03] <markasoftware> when you boot the laptop, enter the seed phrase, and after signing a transaction, copy it over manually to another computer eg by scanning a qr crode
[09:39:57] <buZz> markasoftware: why not coldcard?
[09:40:05] <buZz> that has opensource firmware
[09:40:15] <buZz> and doesnt even need to be connected to a computer
[09:40:31] <buZz> you can sign TX right on the coldcard
[09:40:51] <buZz> with SD card copying tx arojnd
[09:40:53] <buZz> around*
[09:40:55] <markasoftware> that sounds cool

[09:43:29] <buZz> yay!
[09:43:37] <markasoftware> a bit expensive compared to original trezor but using an sd card to move the transactions around definitely seems like it could avoid a few attacks, not to mention less usb setup/compatibility issues i had with ledger on linux
