[09:28:55] <jay-ros> I'm not up to that bit yet
[09:29:08] <JollyRgrs> "i need X permissions, who gives them to me?" "iunno" - the boss probably

[09:37:47] *** Joins: zetorian (~zetorian@2001:470:69fc:105::33ac)
[09:37:50] <Work-BWMerlin> It isn't in accordance with the documentation (I would know, I read it) but it does work
[09:38:10] <xe0n> all you've done is make the clients download the install files, which is what we suggested
[09:38:19] <xe0n> else you'll be complaining about uploading the files to vmware monthly
[09:38:26] <xe0n> you did what we said to do..
[09:38:26] <xe0n> lol
[09:38:46] <Work-BWMerlin> Which is not listed in the offical VMWare documentation as the method todo it
[09:39:00] <xe0n> because they want you to store it on vmware and zap 3gb worth of downloads to a box...
[09:39:07] <Work-BWMerlin> But I do like it, never have to update it (assuming the installer/xml don't need to be updated)
[09:39:15] <xe0n> which makes zero sense when the package in your case is updated monthly..
[09:39:21] <xe0n> yes they do
[09:39:25] <xe0n> check every quarter

[10:05:58] <A-KO> it's good shit though
[10:07:22] <A-KO> holy fuck
[10:07:28] <sd> 07<T​he Tendieman> Am I blind? Not seeing a price.
[10:07:30] <A-KO> I wanted a bottle of their dia de los muertos tequila
[10:07:31] <A-KO> but uh
[10:07:37] <A-KO> $4,000 for the dia de los muertos bottle
[10:07:42] <EvilNinja> fuuck that
[10:07:45] <A-KO> the stuff I linked above is like $150
[10:07:46] <A-KO> for a bottle
[10:08:00] <EvilNinja> that shit better come with a prepaid hooker or something
[10:08:01] <sd> 07<T​he Tendieman> Oh I expected worse.
[10:08:10] <sd> 07<T​he Tendieman> Like its expensive but its attainable.
[10:08:17] <A-KO> yeah the $150 stuff is good
[10:08:21] <A-KO> the Ultra is $1800/bottle
[10:08:27] <A-KO> I might try a shot of that in a few weeks
[10:08:36] <EvilNinja> I cant do tequila
[10:08:41] <EvilNinja> it hits my stomach and comes right back
[10:08:48] <A-KO> I'm USUALLY not a fan of tequilas--but this shit
[10:08:49] <A-KO> this is like
[10:08:53] <A-KO> some really awesome shit
[10:09:05] <A-KO> it's nothing like the cheap shit you find in the local liquor store
[10:09:10] <A-KO> I can't deal with cheap tequila
[10:09:14] <A-KO> but clase azul is.....good shit
[10:09:16] <A-KO> real good shit
[10:09:16] <sd> 07<T​he Tendieman> I don't like tequila either. It doesn't make me sick, I just don't like the taste.

[10:09:30] <A-KO> I'm not usually a tequila fan
[10:09:34] <A-KO> but this stuff is something else
[10:09:47] <A-KO> man I wish I was like a millionaire or some shit
[10:09:56] <A-KO> I'd buy a bottle of that $4,000 tequila so hard lol
[10:09:58] <A-KO> but fuck that
[10:11:01] <EvilNinja> I was homeless a long time ago, spending money like that.. I just cant.. 
[10:11:26] <A-KO> eh I like to live a little bit. I won money in Vegas during defcon so $35 shot wasn't a big deal :)
[10:11:28] <EvilNinja> I am 'doing well' and I couldnt even justify the 1800 bottle
[10:11:32] <A-KO> yeah nah
[10:11:38] <A-KO> but I might get the $200 bottle for my parents
[10:11:58] *** Quits: jay-ros (~jay-ros@user/jay-ros) (Quit: Leaving)

[10:12:18] <EvilNinja> most I've spent on a single bottle is $60
[10:12:33] <EvilNinja> and I didnt even buy it, it was gifted money

[10:13:10] <A-KO> I used to not be a big drinker of booze for the most part, but then I discovered actual liquor instead of like, college kids trying to buy skyy vodka and shit

[10:13:28] <EvilNinja> yeah, I dont buy nasty shit anymore.
[10:13:34] <A-KO> yeah I *really* want to try the ultra ninjastyle
[10:13:38] <EvilNinja> my go-to as of late is Pyrat and Doorlys 8 year old rum
[10:13:39] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Also a guy bought me a shot of it at a bar once for telling him about security shit
[10:13:39] <A-KO> that might be a super special occasion tho
[10:13:45] <A-KO> Pyrat is good shit
[10:13:50] <EvilNinja> mmmhhmmm
[10:13:50] <A-KO> their Pyrat Cask is really fucking good
[10:13:56] <A-KO> but even the cheaper shelf Pyrat is awesome
[10:13:59] <EvilNinja> I havent seen that one
[10:14:11] <A-KO> I got a rum flight at a rum bar in Philadelphia a number of years back
[10:14:19] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I usually just buy mid tier shit for my house
[10:14:21] <A-KO> and it was like 3 reasonably expensive rums, one was Pyrat Cask
[10:14:38] <A-KO> I've mixed Pyrat and Mountain Dew before--don't ask
[10:14:39] <A-KO> it was good tho
[10:14:40] <A-KO> lol
[10:14:47] <A-KO> Haven't tried Doorlys
[10:14:50] <A-KO> I've got uhm

[10:14:56] <A-KO> sec
[10:15:25] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I got nothing. I need to just bite the bullet and go spend money at the liquor store
[10:15:30] <A-KO> I've got 2 of the star trek wines, Ron Zacapa 23, and a bottle of Mount Gay
[10:15:32] <EvilNinja> doorlys has won over pyrat for me. I like pyrat, but doorlys is much better. I used to drink Montanya but I havent been able to find it in a while
[10:15:41] <A-KO> check out Zacapa
[10:15:42] <A-KO> it's good
[10:15:50] <A-KO> but only go for like the 20 year, it's not that expensive tbh if you can find it
[10:15:56] <A-KO> the lower stuff isn't great
[10:15:58] <EvilNinja> I just had this not long ago https://i.imgur.com/5PxKg5T.jpg
[10:16:04] <EvilNinja> that was the $60 bottle I got
[10:16:07] <A-KO> ah yes that was ALSO on the rum flight
[10:16:08] <EvilNinja> was suppper good
[10:16:11] <A-KO> it's awesome
[10:16:17] <A-KO> that bottle is why I started liking Mount Gay rum at all
[10:16:21] <A-KO> so now I buy the cheaper shit for home

[10:20:28] <A-KO> EvilNinja: If you can ever find some, get Black Tot; the original
[10:20:31] <A-KO> it's like $1500/bottle
[10:20:34] <A-KO> I had a shot once for $70
[10:20:41] <A-KO> it has the most wild flavors of any rum I've ever had in my life
[10:20:58] <EvilNinja> euh? 
[10:21:06] <EvilNinja> I'm not a 'wild flavors' kinda guy lol

[10:22:07] <A-KO> at Total Wine
[10:22:16] <A-KO> so it's not bank breaking
[10:22:29] <EvilNinja> hm, I'll have to see if I can find that next time I go
[10:22:40] <EvilNinja> I'm a big fan of barbados style rum
[10:22:52] <EvilNinja> cant say I've had any guatemalan rums
[10:22:53] <A-KO> it's a shame that rum isn't as popular in the states as whiskey/gin/etc.
[10:23:01] <EvilNinja> yeah
[10:23:15] <A-KO> I really am not a huge fan of whiskey tbh
[10:23:16] <EvilNinja> tbh I'm okay with that, I prefer it stays being imported lol
[10:23:20] <A-KO> lol

[10:24:28] <EvilNinja> no fuckin thanks
[10:24:37] <A-KO> LOL
[10:24:51] <EvilNinja> how am I supposed to put down 1/3 of a bottle and still be functional the next day?

[10:27:40] <A-KO> I can barely drink Captain Morgan anymore--almost tastes like syrup
[10:27:41] <EvilNinja> I went to the Manhattan pier for new years the first year I was here because I didnt know any better. spent 90% of my time in line to the point where I'd buy 2 drinks, drink one of them and then get back in line for another set while drinking the second one
[10:27:46] <A-KO> it's rum in the way that Mrs. Butterworth's is syrup
[10:27:50] <EvilNinja> lol
[10:28:04] <EvilNinja> thats the best comparison I've ever heard
[10:28:15] <A-KO> Sailor Jerry is my minimum these days, and that's one thing I'm super happy about moving here
[10:28:20] <A-KO> Jerry is actually reasonably decent to find here
[10:28:21] <A-KO> not 100%
[10:28:24] <A-KO> but many bars carry it
[10:28:26] * EvilNinja gags
[10:28:35] <A-KO> hey look. When you're going to a shitty dive bar
[10:28:40] <A-KO> you don't have a lot of options
[10:28:40] <EvilNinja> I'd rather drink captain than sailor jerry
[10:28:50] <EvilNinja> true that
[10:29:03] <A-KO> oh I'm the opposite. Although honestly they're almost interchangeable. But I think Jerry edges out Morgan just a hair for me
[10:29:10] <A-KO> but they're nothing like Zacapa or Pyrat
[10:29:16] <A-KO> like not even in the same ballpark
[10:29:27] <EvilNinja> I used to go to this dive bar in.. I guess it was technically Manhattan, that closed down. they had an Indian motor for the beer taps, was cool as fuck
[10:29:43] <A-KO> lol
[10:29:51] <A-KO> I hit up some really fucked shit down here in Irvine

[15:09:46] <teh_f4ll3n> not only it's SFW, it's mandatory for work
[15:09:57] <Activ8> I had couple tickets had to convert mailboxes to shared ones, couple people left the company and as usual someone else wanted access to the mailbox
[15:10:01] <thegodsquirrel> Honestly though, I hope to never be in the same room with my co-workers ever
[15:10:21] <thegodsquirrel> and that's not because I don't like them, we don't ever need to meet
[15:10:23] <Activ8> I wish people would stop giving out personal mailboxes instead of shared ones when it's a small company
[15:12:29] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, if it requires ongoing contact or there is a need for continuing contact with customers, sales@company.com is the way to go
[15:13:02] <teh_f4ll3n> anything that's not personal get's ccd to info@
[15:13:08] <xe0n> lolll
[15:14:15] <teh_f4ll3n> anything financial goes to accounts@
[15:14:49] <xe0n> data governance...and policy...and the correct tools help, but yes its problem that will hang around, but there are ways to manage it
[15:15:09] <teh_f4ll3n> any technical admin accounts are on tech@ which only myself and the MD have access to
[15:15:43] <teh_f4ll3n> we went from 13 ppl to 18 ppl this year
[15:15:46] <teh_f4ll3n> welp
[15:17:33] <Activ8> what I mean is when they want to make personal email address for everyone when they don't need too
[15:17:38] <Activ8> it just causes more admin work
[15:17:50] <Activ8> and it's much cheaper
[15:17:55] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> Having a personal is standard though
[15:18:12] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, everyone needs a named email

[15:19:00] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> Maybe but "it's the standard"
[15:19:27] <Activ8> shouldn't be the standard, anyway if they want to pay that's cool just more money for us
[15:19:32] <xe0n> lol you haven't been doing this for long, have you?
[15:19:43] <Activ8> too long xe0n
[15:19:47] <xe0n> lolll
[15:20:00] <thegodsquirrel> 6 months in IT is too long
[15:20:07] <Activ8> try 20 years
[15:21:27] <estranger> 18 years was enough for me
[15:25:08] <Activ8> I don't email much, I use the service desk, which emails automatically to the customer from the ticket system and on a reply updates the ticket
[15:25:13] <Activ8> perfect
[15:25:33] <Activ8> I use teams to discuss anything personal
[15:26:42] <teh_f4ll3n> if you can't afford a personal mailbox for an employee, you need to rethink your strategy 
[15:27:43] <teh_f4ll3n> now whether they need one or not is a different issue
[15:28:26] <xe0n> pretty much
[15:28:35] <xe0n> plus it isnt more work to create a mailbox for someone, all that should be automated lol1

[15:28:54] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[15:29:14] <xe0n> shared mailboxes are the ones you tend to do manually lol

[15:30:32] <Activ8> we disable a mailbox the day someone leaves
[15:30:42] <xe0n> thats not a tech issue, thats a policy and data governance issue lol

[15:38:26] <xe0n> re: the 10 previous mailboxes, that's a policy\data governance issue. there needs to be a process where you wind down the old ones eventually over a period of time
[15:38:37] <xe0n> we have a process that seems to work, not always, but most of the time it works

[15:48:02] <sd> 15<F​actor> legal will probably ask you to keep if there's no motivating factor (hehe) to get rid of them

[15:50:15] <sd> 15<F​actor> i just like the idea of keeping it in shared mailboxes because if they ever need it, you can just go to the EAC and add the person. then it just pops up in Outlook and they can do anything they want from there

[18:43:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol 
[18:43:15] <AnonymooseReddtr> why do you say that
[18:43:15] <Activ8> I rolled out teams to many companies
[18:43:21] <Activ8> and lets just say it just worked
[18:43:22] <GobbleGibby> its only as shit as you make it
[18:43:22] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Also, people have left, so teams isn't going to work for us
[18:43:39] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> "it's only as shit as you make it" <-- FUCKING EXACTLY
[18:43:43] <sd> 15<F​actor> i like teams
[18:43:52] <GobbleGibby> its clunky and slow, but I enjoy it
[18:44:00] <Activ8> I like teams
[18:44:02] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I have the utmost faith in our "architects" to completely fuck up a teams rollout
[18:44:08] <sd> 11<H​otmess> teams is pretty good
[18:44:09] <Activ8> but don't use it for anything else except text

[18:44:11] <teh_f4ll3n> *in cmdt. Lassard voice* many, many wonderful companies
[18:44:13] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I'm sure we'll fuck it up
[18:44:14] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but monday/slack is better
[18:44:15] <Activ8> so might as well use irc
[18:44:18] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I like teams though it can be weird about gobbling resources
[18:44:24] <sd> 11<H​otmess> esp for simulatinus editing with monday
[18:44:31] <sd> 15<F​actor> we use IRC internally, but i wish we used teams
[18:44:38] <JollyRgrs> architechs? teams?
[18:44:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> time to link the xkcd
[18:44:44] <GobbleGibby> man, internal IRC would be baller 
[18:44:46] <signofzeta> @Factor Where the hell do you work? :-)
[18:44:47] <JollyRgrs> it's 100% cloud, what's to architech?

[18:44:56] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Oh, Jolly...
[18:44:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> is the irc 100% logged?

[18:44:58] <DoTheNeedful> XKCD #2342 "Exposure Notification": https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exposure_notification.png - I don't see why everyone is so hungry for BAD news, but fine, I'll give in to feedback and add a dark mode.
[18:45:03] <sd> 15<F​actor> no, no logs
[18:45:09] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Let me explain the joy of working where I do...
[18:45:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> not sure thats even legal in the event of a ediscovery
[18:45:22] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but 🤷
[18:45:41] <sd> 15<F​actor> it's for security, we use it to send PW back and forth if needed
[18:45:51] <sd> 15<F​actor> so having logs of that would not be good
[18:45:51] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> We have to have to have our architects plan out the rollout.  And we're in healthcare, so our security architect has to make sure we're not doing anything stupid.

[18:46:01] <JollyRgrs> oh
[18:46:03] <voice06[m]> UID_Zero, you work in back you see no smiles?

[18:46:08] <sd> 11<H​otmess> "we send passwords so we break law"
[18:46:11] <JollyRgrs> well... of course you're doing something stupid
[18:46:25] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> wtf
[18:46:28] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly i am scremaing into void rn
[18:46:34] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so i am noping out of this
[18:46:34] <signofzeta> @Factor -- I hope your IRC server mandates TLS connections.  Misconfiguration could put you in hot water, depending on which field you're in.
[18:46:45] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> We're currently using Cisco Jabber...which is shitty...and I'm sure we'll go into Teams with the intent to bastardize it somehow...
[18:46:52] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Here use this to send passwords
[18:46:52] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> https://onetimesecret.com/
[18:47:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> jabber uses same protocol as teams but its a bit out of date
[18:47:03] <Activ8> pst pst pst
[18:47:08] <sd> 15<F​actor> i did not set up the IRC
[18:47:18] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> We also use Jabber for our soft phones
[18:47:23] <signofzeta> we use Traceless.IO for sending customers passwords.  It integrates with our PSA.
[18:47:37] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I assume Teams can tie into our on-prem phone system somehow, I don't know if that's the plan or not...
[18:47:49] <sd> 11<H​otmess> please tell me your not finance/goenment/law
[18:47:53] <Activ8> lol
[18:48:08] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> send passwords via IRC because you think it isn't logged is a fundamental misunderstanding of how IRC works.
[18:48:26] <sd> 15<F​actor> @UID_Zero you can tie it into your on prem phone system (assuming it's PBX), you just need to use a third party tool
[18:48:32] <teh_f4ll3n> we don't send customers' passwords. At all. Any password a customer would need, they can reset themselves via "Forgot password"
[18:48:42] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> @Factor That's more shit for the architects to work out.
[18:48:45] <Activ8> it won't be logged if your the one who implemented the server
[18:48:45] <teh_f4ll3n> then again, we're not an MSP
[18:49:05] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly i think its engineer to engineer
[18:49:11] <sd> 11<H​otmess> not b2c
[18:49:19] <sd> 15<F​actor> yes it's only between engineers internally
[18:49:29] <sd> 15<F​actor> it's behind a VPN that uses 2fa
[18:49:34] <sd> 14<K​illnine> 3CX supports tying Teams to it
[18:49:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> b2c would be actually criminally liable
[18:49:44] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but you should still use a KMS
[18:49:49] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but 🤷
[18:49:53] <sd> 14<K​illnine> But we're just dumping 3CX and going fully Teams where MS handles the phone lines too
[18:50:10] <sd> 14<K​illnine> For our size org it's actual about cost neutral and will give much better quality of service
[18:50:14] <sd> 15<F​actor> we have a password manager, but there are still times we need it
[18:50:31] <sd> 14<K​illnine> But for a large Org I think it would get expensive very quickly.
[18:50:33] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> We have a full-on Cisco phone system, so I'm sure there's some magic to be done to tie it into Teams...and that's a different group's problem.
[18:50:37] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> ls
[18:50:40] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> damn it.
[18:50:47] <sd> 11<H​otmess> cisco uses xmmp and sip
[18:50:53] <sd> 11<H​otmess> which is what teams uses
[18:51:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> hell cisoc invented xmpp
[18:51:10] <sd> 11<H​otmess> then opensorced it

[18:51:30] <sintax> and you pay through the nose for them to support it. 
[18:51:48] <sd> 11<H​otmess> depends if your using a cisco UCS
[18:51:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or just using the phones
[18:52:15] <sd> 15<F​actor> i got the whole chat mad at me sheesh lol
[18:52:17] <sd> 11<H​otmess> phones work fine with teams without a UCS its just a few dhcp settings
[18:52:46] <sintax> I've not problem with using teams for phone calls. 
[18:52:49] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and honestly sometimes teams is the inferor product to UCS
[18:52:57] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I'm sure it won't be a big deal.
[18:53:04] <sintax> i just wish teams would shrink down to the size of of AIM and not demand half the screen
[18:53:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> not gonna lie i agree there too sintax
[18:53:26] <GobbleGibby> a pop-out chat interface would be nice
[18:53:40] <sintax> GobbleGibby: for sure
[18:53:41] <sd> 15<F​actor> here's the PBX to teams tool we use
[18:53:41] <sd> 15<F​actor> https://bigcloudconsultants.com/teammate/
[18:53:55] <sintax> @Hotmess there's no reason it needs half my screen. Shrink down
[18:54:08] <teh_f4ll3n> GobbleGibby, your face is a pop-out chat interface
[18:54:09] <sd> 11<H​otmess> welcome to MS moible first development
[18:54:10] <teh_f4ll3n> HA!
[18:54:14] <GobbleGibby> teh_f4ll3n: I'm offended.
[18:54:17] <sd> 15<F​actor> our voip engineer set it up, so I can't speak to it directly. he said it was painless enough to setup
[18:54:19] <sd> 11<H​otmess> "4 screens whats that?" -MS
[18:54:28] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Teams has a pop out chat window???
[18:54:39] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> yes
[18:54:41] <GobbleGibby> you can pop out conversations, yes
[18:54:43] <sd> 13<C​olour> Teams doesn't seem to like me copying from it

[18:54:56] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> individual conversations, not the entire chat section
[18:54:57] <sintax> and sometimes teh search in Teams for me gets wonky and annoying. 
[18:54:59] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honeslty no1 thing MS need to do is check how/what environment its running in and have an alterative UI for desktop use imo
[18:55:05] <sd> 13<C​olour> Half the time it won't copy unless you close and re open teams
[18:55:22] <GobbleGibby> I have that issue with Slack, Colour
[18:55:25] <sd> 13<C​olour> Or it'll let you copy one line but not multiple
[18:55:26] <sintax> Teams needs some fine tuning but we got a new OS/skin.
[18:55:33] <sd> 13<C​olour> Oof I assumed it was Teams only!
[18:55:35] * sintax shrugs
[18:55:51] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly id like a discord enterprise
[18:55:56] <teh_f4ll3n> GobbleGibby, never had that issue with Slack
[18:55:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> call it concord or something
[18:56:02] <sintax> heh
[18:56:14] <sd> 11<H​otmess> add in all the needed enteripse backend and ppl would jump on it
[18:56:24] <sd> 13<C​olour> Call it Q
[18:56:29] <GobbleGibby> teh_f4ll3n: and I've never had that issue with Teams, sooo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:56:33] <sd> 15<F​actor> i haven't run into a lot of the problems that people have with teams. it's not efficient, and it's missing features, but it is pretty solid tool
[18:56:47] <sd> 15<F​actor> just wish it was a lil bit better
[18:57:00] <sintax> i mean it's a great front end for SP/onedrive. 
[18:57:01] <teh_f4ll3n> we are in agreement then, GobbleGibby. Ticket closed, unable to reproduce issue
[18:57:08] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly for all the shitting on teams it gets its a decent product for 95% of users
[18:57:11] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> Havent used slack in years.. but i remember preferring slack over teams
[18:57:12] <sintax> and it's getting better. I just wish they'd do a few things and i'd be happier with it. 
[18:57:18] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> now im just so used to teams
[18:57:24] <sd> 15<F​actor> so we sell teams as "the hub for all MS365 tools"
[18:57:39] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the phone verison of teams is really stripped down
[18:58:01] <sd> 15<F​actor> for a lot of our custs, they can work almost exclusively in teams and be fine
[18:58:03] <sd> 11<H​otmess> which you can use on andriod subsystem on win11
[18:58:06] <teh_f4ll3n> @Hotmess anything MS phone version is
[18:58:33] <sd> 15<F​actor> the phone system is lack luster
[18:58:48] <sd> 11<H​otmess> cause on the backend its skype for buiness
[18:58:54] <sd> 15<F​actor> that's where the connector comes in though. with teams becomes a soft phone basically
[18:59:07] <sd> 15<F​actor> with that teams becomes a softphone**
[19:00:59] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I used Skype4Business and then Teams for last 5-6 years and it's been great as a phone/chat combo
[19:01:07] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I really hope that when we do move to Teams, we actually do a full migration and kill the old products.
[19:01:09] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Not sure what is stripped down from it...
[19:01:16] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I'm on Jabber, but there are some people still on Lync
[19:01:24] <sd> 14<K​illnine> oh yeah, lync... hah
[19:01:29] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> They never fully completed the migration, so we're in a weird half-moved state.
[19:01:33] <Activ8> https://twitter.com/Owl__Kitty/status/1454793331196583943 LOL
[19:01:35] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> So now we have to do 2 migrations to Teams.
[19:01:44] <teh_f4ll3n> we all go back to IRC, no?
[19:01:45] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Oh thats fun
[19:01:59] <sintax> teh_f4ll3n: i'm down with just using irc.

[19:04:42] <PrincessZoey> Just did
[19:04:47] <GobbleGibby> yeah, some clients display images in-line
[19:04:48] <JollyRgrs> waste of money
[19:04:50] <Activ8> nice 
[19:04:52] <GobbleGibby> I got that shit turned off

[19:05:12] <GobbleGibby> ye, no previews
[19:05:17] <JollyRgrs> GobbleGibby: what? you don't want some troll waltzing in spraying CP links to have it show up on your client?

[19:05:30] <Activ8> I'm not a fan of irccloud
[19:05:50] <GobbleGibby> JollyRgrs: I mean, no I dont, but there are some other nefarious thing that can be done with previews that I don't care to have happen to me
[19:05:51] <JollyRgrs> @Factor IRC servers care NOTHING about how your client handles URLs of images
[19:06:03] <JollyRgrs> GobbleGibby: oh i know :D
[19:06:07] <GobbleGibby> :) 
[19:06:09] <JollyRgrs> but yes, what you said as well
[19:06:22] <JollyRgrs> kinda like SMSing an image to iOS devices... what could possibly go wrong?
[19:06:25] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I consider them enough of a convenience that they're worth the occasional Goatse or beheading.
[19:06:28] <sd> 15<F​actor> so the way we have to send images internally is send them as a file
[19:06:38] <GobbleGibby> yeah its far worse than that heh
