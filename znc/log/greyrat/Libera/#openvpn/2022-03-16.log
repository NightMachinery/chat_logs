[01:03:47] <UncleKiwi> hello good people
[01:04:32] * rob0 pouts at being excluded :(
[01:04:56] <UncleKiwi> im wondering if I can in my client config add a dns server in the clients .ovpn file
[01:05:02] <UncleKiwi> rob0 ahaha
[01:05:07] <UncleKiwi> you must be good
[01:05:19] <UncleKiwi> everyone has a bit of good in them
[01:05:39] <UncleKiwi> apparently the war is within 
[01:06:16] <rob0> wait, if you're running the client, why would you need openvpn to push the DNS server?  You could just set it.
[01:06:44] <rob0> is it a nameserver that's only accessible when connected to VPN?
[01:07:29] <UncleKiwi> I dont want to push th dns to all clients and the ovpn server is a sophos appliance
[01:07:38] <UncleKiwi> so i cant mess with the server side config]
[01:07:53] <UncleKiwi> see the twist im in 
[01:08:31] <rob0> no, is the nameserver only accessible through the VPN?
[01:08:47] <UncleKiwi> yes 
[01:08:59] <UncleKiwi> sorry yes its only accisable thru vpn
[01:09:23] <UncleKiwi> so when vpn is on i want that dns switched in 
[01:09:26] <rob0> and what are you interested in, local names?  Like DHCP hostnames?
[01:09:53] <UncleKiwi> active director I guess maybe
[01:10:20] <UncleKiwi> there are windows things in the network being vpn'd into
[01:10:34] <UncleKiwi> I need the client to be able to talk the dns 
[01:10:46] <UncleKiwi> to the windows world of dns
[01:11:23] <UncleKiwi> https://youtu.be/eIwpKh4oEcY
[01:11:37] <UncleKiwi> im going to the beach to solve this 
[01:12:24] <UncleKiwi> so do you know what im asking 
[01:12:34] <UncleKiwi> or have I made a mess of the question 
[01:13:32] <UncleKiwi> dhcp-option DNS <dns_server_ip_address>
[01:13:38] <UncleKiwi> looks like maybe this might work
[01:14:04] <rob0> that is indeed a client option
[01:14:11] <UncleKiwi> yep
[01:14:24] <rob0> usually seen as a "push", but not necessarily

[16:45:50] <mzar> perhaps we will be able to test it after commiting , but Gert or someone else has to update the port

[17:51:15] <ordex> still changing a bit :)
[17:57:49] <mzar> I have not so many instances of CURRENT running, it makes tests harder, and the patch last time I was trying to apply it on stable/13 wasn't applying corrrectly

[22:52:27] <Xanthaos> Does anybody have any links regarding a good fail2ban setup for openvpn? I've got a few hits on that port, definitely from the outside, from unauthorized addresses. Figured I'd get some use from fail2ban again.
[22:52:28] <mannequin> but she loves her children
[22:53:28] <Xanthaos> okay, even so doesn't stop me from wishing the best for everyone here
[22:53:42] <Xanthaos> icluding you lol
[22:55:08] <mannequin> you can wish whatever you like, just be carefull what you wish for
[22:55:22] <mannequin> sometimes wishes come true
[22:56:26] <mannequin> especially when you meet a genie
[22:56:31] <Xanthaos> But back to my statement, I'm not seeing tons of hits, but there is the occasional drive-by (4 today so far) so I'd like to use my fail2ban to possibly catch those strays.
[22:56:35] <Xanthaos> lol that's true
[22:58:26] <Xanthaos> But I still wish well for everyone. The whole 'Do unto others' concept.
