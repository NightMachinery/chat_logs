[00:06:51] <bin> if an ID has a period in it how do you target it without the browser thinking you're using a class selector? like how do you escape it?
[00:07:13] <bin> is it just #this\.id
[00:07:15] <bin> i guess i can tias
[00:08:49] <matsaman> yeah, although I'm not 100% sure you're meant to ever have '.' in an id
[00:08:57] <matsaman> I guess validator.nu _should_ tell you

[00:10:11] <matsaman> heheh
[00:10:30] <bin> i wouldn't do something like that unless there was some necessity that i cant even think of right now lol
[00:10:36] <matsaman> you could always do like [id*="this"][id*="id"]
[00:10:38] <bin> i'd just use a hyphen or underscore to avoid escaping
[00:10:43] <matsaman> or ^="this"][id$="id", etc.
[00:10:45] <matsaman> boring hacks
[00:10:49] <bin> looks like \ escaping works

[12:15:03] <OnkelTem> Hi all. How to divide a flex box vertically into 3 equal parts?
[12:15:22] <OnkelTem> The trick with flex-grow: 1 + stretching didn't work
[12:18:48] <OnkelTem> For example: https://codepen.io/onkeltem/pen/VwWjdGg
[12:19:35] <AMcBain> Well problem number one is that the body is, by default, only as large as its contents.
[12:19:50] <AMcBain> If you don't do anything to make the body bigger, then there's no room for the flexbox to take up it hasn't already.
[12:21:47] <AMcBain> So if you wanted it to take up the entire height of the viewport I would do: html { height: 100%; } body { min-height: 100%; margin: 0; } then change #container from height: 300px; to min-height: 100%; perhaps.
[12:23:01] <AMcBain> Sorry, you want height: 100%; on the body not min-height if you're going to do that.
[12:23:08] <OnkelTem> Well, but how does that relate to the flex boxes not having the same height?
[12:26:07] <AMcBain> Oh, sorry, you want something like flex: 1 1 0; on #container > div.
[12:26:51] <AMcBain> However they still might not shrink past their content size, though you can then apply a height: 33% or whatever you desire.
[12:28:42] <AMcBain> 1 1 0 is shorthand for flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink 1; and flex-basis: 0;
[12:30:09] <OnkelTem> Oh, thanks! I think that's what I neede - flex-basis
[12:30:14] <OnkelTem> and shrink
[12:30:57] <AMcBain> Shrink defaults to 1, but if you're going to set both grow and basis, may as well use the shorthand.
[12:31:26] <AMcBain> However things don't tend to shrink below their basis, hence the issue here.

[12:46:48] <theskillwithin> no
[12:46:56] <AMcBain> jwpapi, michigan, no, but maybe: if you're using something experimental or non-standard that was created before all browsers agreed to stop using prefixes in favor of preference settings, then yes. Otherwise, no.
[12:47:43] <michigan> Cool
[12:48:47] <michigan> Hey like that backwards-compatibility stuff! It's not needed either right?
[12:48:54] <AMcBain> Experimental/non-standard items include -webkit-line-clamp, ::-webkit-scrollbar/::webkit-scrollbar-*/::webkit-resizer, -webkit-text-stroke, etc.
[12:49:09] <AMcBain> Well, it depends on how far back you're targeting whether you need fallbacks.
[12:49:22] <AMcBain> I wouldn't bother with fallbacks for things like rounded corners and other similar stuff.
[12:49:26] <michigan> Never heard of any of that. Nice
[12:49:30] <michigan> hehe
[12:49:48] <theskillwithin> postcss covers you usually
[12:50:12] <AMcBain> You can search MDN for -webkit- to find most of it. Many browsers decided since they weren't going to ever be standardized they'd support them as is, even with the "-webkit-" prefix, making prefixes effectively useless even after the switch to preferences.

[12:53:33] <theskillwithin> i think so
[12:53:37] <FunkyBob> ah, yes, 14.1
[12:53:40] <theskillwithin> inset is bomb af
[12:53:42] <AMcBain> Think browsers will finish their multicolumn support first? ;)
[12:53:54] <FunkyBob> now t hat people are awake
[12:54:10] <FunkyBob> i have a need for even-column sizes in a table... of unknown column count
[12:54:19] <AMcBain> "Multicolumn is the future!" *all browsers implement it differently and terribly*
[12:54:22] <FunkyBob> where (until PM tells me otherwise) t he first column is a different width
[12:55:26] <AMcBain> Hmm. Can tables be flexed? and I don't mean when you buy an MDF desk top and forgot how heavy your monitors were.
[12:55:48] <AMcBain> Wait. This sounds like a grid thing.
[12:56:04] <AMcBain> Grid has the option to do repeating columns.
[12:56:37] <FunkyBob> i'd really rather keep it as a legit <table> ... but am open t o ideas
[12:56:50] <FunkyBob> if I make it us grid, I can probably also do the collapsing rows animation
[12:56:54] <FunkyBob> use
[12:57:03] <theskillwithin> https://react-table.tanstack.com/
[12:57:54] <AMcBain> FunkyBob, I think a grid would still let you keep the table... grid-template-columns: <value> repeat(...); to define your columns for the rows, applied to the tr. Each tr would have to be a grid then I guess, since there's no subgrid (that got nuked, sadly).
[12:59:27] <AMcBain> We use ag-grid at work, which is super heavy compared to <table> but it has a lot of features. So if that's what you want, then might be worth checking out.
[12:59:41] <AMcBain> It has components for Angular, React, and Vue if you don't want PoJS.
[12:59:50] <AMcBain> (but will do that too.)

[13:11:20] <FunkyBob> last feature to add is... fixed row/cols for scrolling :P
[13:11:50] <FunkyBob> I saw reccently position: static; is supported on newer browers THEAD now
[13:12:10] <AMcBain> Yeah. Also auto-fill might wrap when it reaches the end of the container, so I don't know how to go about fixing that...
[13:13:07] <AMcBain> er, static? do you mean sticky? because I've tried that and it worked, iirc.
[13:13:16] <FunkyBob> sticky, sorry, yes
[13:13:20] <FunkyBob> distracted by daughter
[13:13:33] <theskillwithin> LOL i was about to say, static is the deafult

[13:19:45] <theskillwithin> except for react table, i write every component from scratch.  component libraries are shitty
[13:20:05] <theskillwithin> if u know css, u can write your own react components
[13:20:57] <theskillwithin> a little more involved if its like a tab component, but i can write that from scratch as well

[13:27:28] <theskillwithin> thats kinda basic, cant make to do more complex tabs like if u want centered or left aligned etc
[13:27:46] <theskillwithin> shows the general concept tho
[13:28:04] <AMcBain> Hmm, well this is interesting: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Masonry_Layout
[13:29:26] <theskillwithin> really cool, but well
[13:29:59] <AMcBain> FunkyBob, it behaves a little odd at the ends: http://paste.asmcbain.net/0b84785c/edit I couldn't figure out how to get it to not squish the last column. Even a value of minmax(75px, 75px) (which appears to be valid) doesn't stop the squish, but maybe you can figure something out.

[13:37:11] <AMcBain> It is kind funny though, that most things are like "Yeah so we just wrap or make the container bigger" in CSS and grid is like "We wrap by default, but if you change that, we try to fit everything inside the container as much as possible."
[13:37:43] <AMcBain> Stop squishing the final columns, grid!
[13:37:53] <AMcBain> It's not going to fit. Just run it off the end at the size I asked.
[13:38:53] <theskillwithin> so grid for layout, and flex for more specific, is what some people say
[13:39:31] <theskillwithin> but idk about that, how about use whats best for what you want
[13:43:13] <teut> oh grid
[13:43:51] <teut> thanks

[13:46:16] <AMcBain> FunkyBob, eh, OK, I guess there is no "grid" way to solve the squish, but you can tell the td's they have a min-width of the desired width, then let the repeat() cap that as the desired max-width also: http://paste.asmcbain.net/af339b1e/edit

[13:46:23] <AMcBain> No squish, just overflow.
[13:46:31] <teut> can it be done without grid too?
[13:46:47] <AMcBain> I didn't think of that originally since people were all asking how to *stop* overflow, so I kinda figured there must be something I'm missing.

[13:48:56] <AMcBain> I had auto-fit in a previous iteration but that might expand the columns if there isn't enough of them to fill the space, so this last link switches back to auto-fill.
[13:49:44] <AMcBain> FunkyBob, Anyway, good luck. :) I'm off, seeing as it's past 2am and I think I have to demo something (small, but still) in the morning.
