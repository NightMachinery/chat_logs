[14:53:29] <amigojapan> If I read*
[14:56:01] <Delf> Interesting... One of the ways which I become aware that it's the dreams with more "life" is the level of detail and sharpness of sight, the enhanced senses etc. I'm well aware that my eyes suck shit

[15:15:50] <Delf> Yes, there is that. Also, I assume the damage I do in the other dreams are actual so I have code of conduct NOT to do stupid stuff there as well

[15:24:03] <Delf> What is it's value there?
[15:24:08] <amigojapan> Delf: abrahamic religions dreams are seen as for telling the future. In witchcraft dreams are seen as travelling to the spiritual realm. Science also had some theirs but it's not sure
[15:24:19] <dispersed> Delf: What is the value of Moon in heaven
[15:24:33] <dispersed> I suppose it is the gate to heaven
[15:24:59] <Delf> So the moon is heaven's gate?
[15:25:12] <dispersed> as far as I'm concerned, it surely would be an obvious choice
[15:25:36] <amigojapan> dispersed: bitcoin is evil. Most people make money by selling when high which just means the other people end up losing money
[15:25:40] <Delf> For propulsion transportation?
[15:26:01] <dispersed> Heaven's Gate and Moonies are both fringe religions, all we need is combine their doctrines
[15:26:55] <amigojapan> Delf: heavens gate is a suicide cult
[15:27:06] <Delf> Yes, I remember them
[15:27:12] <amigojapan> Moonies are better. They just try to get everyone married
[15:27:43] <dispersed> amigojapan: I guess that makes most assets evil then, still they gain in value compared to not buying any of 'em
[15:28:48] <dispersed> see in economics you cannot just stare at what something is per se, you need to evaluate what others choices there are
[15:29:00] <amigojapan> dispersed: at least with stock there is a possibility the company will do well and gain in that way
[15:29:07] <dispersed> and the choices in this case are: hold money that loses value, or hold an asset which historically loses less value
[15:29:32] <dispersed> with current P/E ratios that isn't going to happen in your lifetime
[15:31:25] <dispersed> but of course, if you can buy a house instead, that makes more sense than assets, surely, .. but what if you already have ahouse
[15:32:23] <Delf> Real estate would be heavier currency. The heaviest of all is full-autonomy
[15:33:17] <amigojapan> For the most part I think the most important thing is to have pure intentions. I don't always have them but I try. And even well intended things can end up being evil

[15:36:57] <amigojapan> Both ended up killing a person but only one is murder
[15:38:11] <Delf> Yes, but the intention itself does not need to be the deciding factor. I require reasons and motivations. The former is dangerous as it does not seem to notice the need to govern itself despite being totally poisoned. This is more like the description of every day people

[15:39:43] <Delf> The second one could be killing someone that does better dead than alive
[15:40:21] <amigojapan> I am a pacifist. I won't kill anyone . That is not my duty
[15:40:36] <Delf> You cannot reason with everyone. Some are determined to kill others for nothing but pleasure. To REFUSE killing those is to allow their victims to be killed by them
[15:40:47] <Delf> I have NO problem whatsoever killing
[15:41:08] <amigojapan> They can be put in prison for life
[15:41:58] <Delf> If that is an option sure. Better yet is to provide them with tools to evolve themselves so that they're no longer slaves to their primitive drives
[15:42:28] <amigojapan> I don't believe in punishment
[15:42:46] <amigojapan> Prison should not include punishment
[15:42:55] <Delf> Well... punishment is more for the damaged one rather than the one that caused the damage
[15:43:34] <megamus_prime> Most penal systems are simply revenge by proxy

[15:44:49] <megamus_prime> Delf, of course, but would you jump straight to murder?
[15:45:23] <Delf> Of course not, only if I see it as the only option
[15:45:30] <dispersed> Delf: The requirement for deeper understanding will always be there, as far as I understand. So that alone cannot resolve the issue
[15:45:32] <amigojapan> Delf: I would call the police
[15:46:03] <Delf> dispersed: Indeed, that alone will not cut it

[15:46:38] <megamus_prime> Delf, if you can murder them you can restrain them. Most countries have some form of citizen's arrest. Also what amigojapan said
[15:46:51] <dispersed> Nussbaum has written a book about anger and how useless it is
[15:46:58] <megamus_prime> but yes in a split second decision, no other choice, it is better to kill

[15:48:44] <Delf> Perhaps. I operate on the basis of being self-compatible. To tolerate myself or anyone else similar to myself
[15:49:05] <megamus_prime> of course it is not a truth in the natural sense, but everyone living in society has some basis they all agree on more or less
[15:49:43] <megamus_prime> Delf, that would depend on where you drew the line on who is similar to you
[15:50:31] <Delf> It's simple. They too should be able to tolerate themselves. It's similar to the golden rule I suppose but still not the same
[15:51:02] <Delf> If I were to copy their behavior, they should be fine with it
[15:51:13] <Delf> If not, then they are in violation
[15:51:56] <megamus_prime> I get what you are saying, but the basis for tolerance should not be merely what you can tolerate on yourself. Imagine for instance a masochist
[15:53:04] <Delf> I cannot realign my position on this matter to suit that of a masochist
[15:53:47] <Delf> If I am to, I must include the other side of it which is a sadist
[15:53:56] <megamus_prime> Yes but that point of view would change according to the parties involved. The social contract would be different for every two set of people.
[15:54:46] <Delf> Rather than treat others the way you want to be treated by others. It should be do NOT treat others in ways you do not want to be treated
[15:54:47] <megamus_prime> Well a sadist would generally have the same requirements for their self as a normal person. They would just disregard the tolerance of others, I figure
[15:56:16] <megamus_prime> My point of view, is that of a more general social contract. But is a tricky one to define. Besides personal integrity and safety, when you get into social interactions it's difficult sometimes to describe what is harmful and not in a proper way :/
[15:57:15] <Delf> Some harm is good :)
[15:57:17] <megamus_prime> For instance, you should be able to express your opinion about a certain person. Even if it's negative. But where would the line be between expressing an opinion and harassment for instance?
[15:57:42] <megamus_prime> Delf, it depends on how that harm comes to be
[15:57:48] <Delf> Harassment is when you do something to harm
[15:58:24] <megamus_prime> Oh that brings me to another point! The social contract should not be based on intent, but action.
[15:58:27] *** Joins: Rashad (~textual@2a01:9700:15ef:ef00:ccd4:7939:50d7:c572)
[15:58:46] <Delf> The action itself, not even the result of it?
[15:59:21] <megamus_prime> Delf in a perfect contract yes the action. We judge the result because of the imperfection of our current social contracts
[15:59:37] <dispersed> a contract is not an action tho
[15:59:44] <dispersed> it is an intent
[16:00:00] <dispersed> well, unless you mean blockchain smart contracts
[16:00:10] <megamus_prime> what I mean by contract is basically some rights and limits we as a society agree on
[16:00:14] <Delf> This is also problematic. Consider a situation where I'm about to cause serious damage to myself and someone else notices it, warns me, I disregard and tell them to fuck off. They intervene to prevent me from causing damage to myself... I fail to harm myself and I never understood the danger
[16:00:20] <megamus_prime> it's the laws and the culture praticies
[16:01:13] <megamus_prime> Delf, damage to yourself is your right in my opinion. Other people have the right to try to help you, but for example if you were suicidal, it would be wrong to lock you in a hospital against your will
[16:02:20] <Delf> I fail to harm myself and I never understood the danger, this indicates that it was not an attempt at self-harm. I should've mentioned it earlier
[16:02:39] <megamus_prime> Oh you mean by accident

[16:07:34] <Delf> Some are afraid to become murderers
[16:07:41] <megamus_prime> but that in itself can be interpreted as a judgement. For example people value self-preservation. Waiting for authorities is a way to distance themselves from a dangerous situation

[16:09:04] <Delf> Yes, sometimes we do too much for self-preservation. There are conditions and circumstances where surviving them is NOT worth the cost
[16:09:31] <megamus_prime> It's deeply entrenched in our biology
[16:09:45] <Delf> I rather die trying to kill someone who is about to murder an innocent girl
[16:10:30] <megamus_prime> I wouldn't really
[16:10:42] <megamus_prime> I would try to save her, but only if I knew I had a chance
[16:10:53] <megamus_prime> if it was certain death, I probably wouldn't
[16:11:01] <Delf> This way I become more dangerous than the murderer because I have no need to self-preserve or rather... I move my self-preservation function over to the little girl. The little girl would be representing my SELF
[16:11:04] <megamus_prime> well depending on how my mental health was at the moment
[16:12:07] <megamus_prime> Delf, that wouldn't necessarily make you more dangerous. And if you failed two people would've died. Would that be better?
[16:12:18] <Delf> No
[16:12:42] <Delf> When I die I inhabit the body of the murderer and commit suicide for having killed my previous host
[16:12:59] <Delf> There is no escaping me :)
[16:13:56] <megamus_prime> Well... That's something
[16:14:20] <Delf> Yes, this alone makes my behavior very different than that of one that can be ended by death
[16:14:32] <Delf> And most will neither understand nor be able to relate to it
[16:14:47] <megamus_prime> The belief in ghosts/possession?
[16:15:08] <Delf> I don't know about ghosts but I can take over hosts once my current one is dead
[16:15:16] <Delf> Against their will
[16:15:41] <megamus_prime> When did you begin to think you could do that?
[16:15:54] <Delf> When I took over my current host :)
[16:16:17] <Delf> But this was more of a unification rather than a forceful. He was kind enough to welcome me
[16:16:40] <megamus_prime> Then how would you classify yourself, a parasite, a spirit?
[16:16:43] <arryana> this is exactly the kind of fantastical statement that makes you unreliable in my opinion
[16:17:05] <Delf> arryana: This makes me reliable beyond your comprehension rather.
[16:17:09] <arryana> no.
[16:17:14] <arryana> your wishful thinking is not fact.
[16:17:15] <megamus_prime> arryana, it's chunnibyou syndrome
[16:18:27] <Delf> Don't know what you mean by spirit. A parasite is dependant on their host, I'm not so this does not apply to me
[16:19:32] <megamus_prime> Deft, I mean, you must be similar to something. What you are describing is usually in folklore regarded as a spirit or a ghost. In the sense of something like a roaming soul.
[16:19:42] <megamus_prime> Would you consider yourself human despite?
[16:20:00] <Delf> My host is human
[16:20:09] <megamus_prime> But you yourself
[16:20:18] <megamus_prime> you clearly make a distinction between yourself and the host
[16:20:33] <Delf> The host is part of myself too :D
[16:21:13] <megamus_prime> does the host retain consciousness?
[16:21:18] <Delf> Yes
[16:21:36] <Ungwelian> "Nothing of the host survives."
[16:21:46] <megamus_prime> so the host has some sort of component in pratice similar to you? In a sense a soul?

[18:47:52] <Lumine> Disclaimer: I don't know that much about it, but I often wonder about it and its applications to my own situation. So I thought maybe it might spark some discussion. It concerns the problem of translation.
[18:48:41] <Lumine> Specifically, the way in which we confuse description about the world, with the world. "The map is not the territory" as the famous quote goes.
[18:50:43] <Lumine> And I wonder whether this confusion works in our favor, or against us. An example being this person who thinks they know their stuff about a certain country. And then they travel to it and it turned out to be something else entirely.

[19:12:41] <Lumine> It's very useful, to be able to take something, and explain it, or describe it. But the trouble comes when we don't know how to describe something. Then the confusion becomes clear. If I'm not articulate enough, the description loses its meaning.

[19:26:09] <arryana> i'm not sure that's true of everyone, lumi
[19:26:40] <evolv> chocolate and tea are considered medicine in Theravada Buddhism
[19:27:53] <evolv> since monastics can only eat once a day before noon, chocolate and tea can help settle later appetite
[19:28:23] <arryana> it's also not irrevocable
[19:28:52] <arryana> going outside to smell the flowers remains an option, at least as long as there's bees
[19:29:20] <arryana> i think the danger is in taking the easy road and replacing real life with digital 'experience'
[19:29:44] <arryana> and while that has a place, it's certainly not the whole banana, as it were.
[19:30:11] <arryana> like reading a lot of books is great for widening horizons, but vicariously living through reading isn't actually living.
[19:31:52] <evolv> Lumine, that was something Baudrillard emphasized. We get an explosion of models, then the models implode and we live a simulation. The models become the real
[19:32:00] *** Quits: ikiryo (sid109660@user/ikiryo) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[19:32:01] <evolv> and what is real becomes lost

[19:33:40] <evolv> the more we learn, the further we are from knowing the truth

[19:34:45] <Lumine> arryana my bad, I didn't mean that everyone has the same problem. But I've never met anyone who at one time or another didn't become overly fascinated by some description. I also didn't mean it as a permanent state. It comes and it goes. So you're right in that it's not irrevocable.
[19:35:02] <evolv> the fantasy of Disneyland contrasts with the world we live outside its walls, the fantasy serves to convince us that the world outside is real
[19:35:43] <arryana> oh, we all have images we hang on to until we experience the reality
[19:35:49] <arryana> that's just human nature

[19:41:51] <Lumine> Well he's right in certain aspects. Nothing can be described fully. Which is why we're so busy coming up with a model that takes all phenomena into account. But as G√∂del suggests by one interpretation with his theorem, such a model will never be achieved.
[19:43:22] <evolv> that's not exactly what makes Baudrillard interesting, it was borrowing from other philosophers, it's his analysis and then the scope of the conclusion
[19:43:49] <evolv> that we live in a simulation (not matrix-style), and it's irreversible
[19:44:13] <evolv> the simulation changes, but nothing changes (political change, understanding of reality for what it really is, etc.)
[19:45:06] <evolv> the models of the real become the real, simulation emerges upon implosion, successive simulation phases further buries the real into a compact, tiny core
