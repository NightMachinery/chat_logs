[12:21:12] <ERROH> how do i make money out of spare steam keys?
[12:22:00] <Faux> Presumably you can sell them to those semi-illegal resellers.
[12:22:09] <Faux> Sell them to friends / communities.
[12:27:44] <ERROH> i've been going thru my humble and realised i have 2 spare eu4 keys, which cost like 10eur which i could use for paying the eu fine
[12:35:09] <Renderwww> you can gift one me, not that I would ever play it but it's missing in my linux games collection
[12:35:58] <Renderwww> also in theory you aren't allowed to sell those humble bundle ones
