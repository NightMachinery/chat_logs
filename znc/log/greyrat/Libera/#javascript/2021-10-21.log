[00:41:33] <Vooloo> I'm trying to figure out chaining functions but am unable to proceed. What I want is when I use .paginated() on the function it should return the complete result instead of the partial result. https://hastebin.com/ovigukihoz.typescript ... what do I need to do?
[00:43:17] <stenno> productService.findAll().then(productService.paginated)
[00:44:00] <stenno> oh hm wait
[00:44:18] <stenno> Vooloo: there is a function definition after the return statement
[00:44:59] <Vooloo> I want the api to look like const products = await productService.findAll().paginated() if possible
[00:45:31] <stenno> but it doesn't make sense
[00:45:43] <stenno> findAll will return a promise, you cannot call paginated on it
[00:45:47] <stenno> so it has to be like
[00:46:51] <stenno> productService.findAll().then(result => productService.paginated() ? result : result.slice(0,2))
[00:46:54] <stenno> something like that
[00:47:19] <Vooloo> I can't use the paginated function like a flag? Instead of doing findall(paginated?: boolean) ...
[00:47:43] <stenno> of course you can
[00:48:23] <stenno> but this was not apparent from your code example

[07:38:11] <Cork> pagios: that call is syncronus as you have await there
[07:38:42] *** Joins: comatory_ (~ondrejsyn@217.11.241.69)
[07:39:13] <Cork> only situation you need an additional await is if you have return new Promise(resolve => { resolve(Promise(...)) })
[07:40:06] <pagios> Cork: what i see now is that the "resuming" line executes before the console.log in the getJwtTokens function
[07:41:19] <pagios> Cork: i am kind of confused honestly
[07:42:16] <Cork> hmm
[07:42:39] <Cork> pagios: are you running getJwtToken in a global scope or what context is it running?
[07:42:52] <pagios> Cork in a useEffect/react hook
[07:43:16] <pavonia> Isn't that expected as getJwtToken is asynchronous itself?
[07:43:28] <pagios> Cork:  https://dpaste.com/BC6H8GBUU
[07:44:15] <pagios> line 16 outputs before line 11
[07:44:15] <Cork> pagios: that is in an anonymous function that isn't async

[07:44:30] <Cork> that is most likely the cause of you problem
[07:44:35] <Cork> but not fully sure
[07:44:45] <pagios> which anonymous function ?
[07:44:59] <Cork>  useEffect(() => {
[07:45:22] <pagios> you mean useEffect( async () => ... }
[07:45:23] <Cork> note i don't mean useEffect

[12:52:46] <Deneb> in JS it is possible to make a function or obect a member e.g. function mywidget { this.myarray = []} ; will allow the myarray to be accessed as myobj = new widget; array = widget.myarray; This works provided this.myarray is nested inside the function. It is possible to do the same thing when the array is defined elsewhere in another file?
[12:53:52] <Deneb> the application is that the arrays represent ROMs and the function represents the ROM handler, but each ROM is defined in a separate file...
[12:53:57] <thykka> Deneb, could pass it to the constructor
[12:54:49] <thykka> something like const roms = getRoms(); const myWidget = new Widget(roms); myWidget.myArray
[12:55:21] <thykka> then in the constructor myWidget.prototype.constructor = function(roms) { this.roms = roms; }
[12:55:31] <thykka> err.. this.myarray = roms
[12:55:33] <thykka> or whatever
[12:56:16] <thykka> class syntax is preferred nowadays though
[12:56:26] <thykka> if your environment supports it
[12:58:41] <Deneb> thykka: thanks. Trying to get my head around that. At present I have romexpander = new romexp; In romexp.js (which is included in the main HTML file) I have function romexp(){ this.leftbankhandler = function(){}; this rightbankhandler = function(){}; }.
[12:59:19] <Deneb> Each rom is currently defined as an array in seperate files for each rom: e.g. romslot = [somedata];
[12:59:34] <Deneb> there are 16 roms and rom files
[13:00:05] *** Quits: pluri_ (~pluri@user/pluri) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[13:00:50] <Deneb> so does this mean I do expandedrom = new exprom(romslot1, romslot2, romslot3,... etc) ?
[13:01:03] <thykka> probably not
[13:01:47] <thykka> can't say i fully get what your aim is, but if you're considering numbered variables, might as well use an array, no?
[13:02:17] *** Joins: pluri (~pluri@user/pluri)
[13:02:19] <Deneb> slot1 thru slot16 represent 16 arrays holding ROM code
[13:03:04] <Deneb> so there are 16 separate files with the rom code. Each one defines one array.
[13:03:36] <thykka> right, so a 2d array
[13:03:54] <thykka> an array of 16 arrays
[13:04:11] <Deneb> yes, 16 arrays in total which I want to combine into the exprom object
[13:04:21] <thykka> combine?

[13:05:53] <Deneb> well at the moment, the arrays are accessed at globel level, but I would like them to be in the context of romexp rather than global. They don't need to be 'seen' globally'. They are actually accessed by the two handling functions.
[13:06:49] <Deneb> the handling functions handle left and right bank and have a ROM and address parameter passed to them. They return the byte at the given address.
[13:07:01] <thykka> right, so you have to make 16 requests for the files first, then you'd like those to be accessible within romexp as this.romslots?
[13:08:37] <Deneb> thykka: yes, the files are listed in the top html document. Its the only way I could find since JavaScript does not apparently have the equivalent of #include or similar

[13:10:51] <Deneb> yes, script tags is what I am using <script>src="romslot1.js"</script> etc up to 16. The handler is in its own .js file.

[13:14:37] <Deneb> looking at thak lin. Thanks.
[13:15:10] <thykka> you could have a list of URLs ['roms/rom1.json','roms/rom2.json',...] which you could then iterate through and fetch each one. Once all that is done, you'd have the result in an array, which you can then pass onwards

[13:16:18] <thykka> (and vice-versa with JSON.stringify(jsObject) )
[13:16:51] <Deneb> The data looks like this: this.romslot1 = [0x88,0x80,0xD1,0x0D,0x80,0x70,0x8D,0x80,....]. Each rom file has exactly one array which represents 8kb or ROm data. It could all be put into one long file but that makes handling rather difficult for the user if they want to change the ROM.
[13:17:14] <Deneb> BTW, I am not working with a server, just locally in a browser.

[13:21:49] <Deneb> thykka: yes, this is the limitation. You can't open a local file within code without getting prompted with a dialogue box hence the inclusion within <script> tags. It might be easier to combine the whole lot into one 128kb file. The user will just have to make use of find/search to locate a ROM.

[16:00:36] <stenno> check my code

[16:36:03] <jaawerth> so long as the .then has the same signature as a normal .then (accepts an onresolve,onreject as args and returns a promise) you can still await it. Like, knex has a weird .then, which triggers the query/migration/whatever you've built before returning a promise - you can totally await it, it's just that doing so triggers the action
[16:36:14] <jaawerth> I do that a lot in knex migrations since it tends to make them cleaner-looking
[16:36:50] <jaawerth> it's just weird since you normally expect awaiting or .then'ing something to be a *reaction*, not something that mutates state
[16:37:39] <jaawerth> but I haven't done much with cypress so I don't know if its .then falls under that category - but I would be pretty surprised to see a .thenable that didn't at least pretend to be a promise when you invoke .then

[20:43:24] <efdee> i'm not going to lie, i was a huge angular fan when it first came out - coming from jquery and backbone.
[20:43:38] <efdee> but angular lacked a decent composability story. and then along came react.
[20:43:43] <systemfault> Same, how could you not be? The alternatives all sucked.

[20:46:13] <systemfault> Same for angular devs for me...

[23:06:22] <daoudr> my condolences
[23:07:00] <samsch> What am I looking for to do an a reverse-regex expansion. Like given `[B-D][ea]` it outputs `['Be', 'Ba', 'Ce', 'Ca', 'De', 'Da']`? I'm assuming such exist, but I can't think of what it's called to find it
[23:07:31] <stenno> does that really make sense?
[23:07:34] <samsch> Doesn't have to be regex, just need to expand all possible letter combinations given specific word layouts
[23:07:36] <stenno> how would you handle .*
[23:07:41] <stenno> ah fair
