[05:39:48] <jaggz> the point being that I keep my own scripts in a git repo
[05:40:22] <jaggz> but it's not "automatically" sourced -- I put a . ~/bin/tab-completion.sh in my ~/bin/bashrc

[09:19:01] <transhumanist> how do I convert the input lat lon into floats when I pass them to python it sees them as strings

[09:20:18] <kurahaupo> Or do you mean that the values include quote marks (which doesn't mean "string", it just means two extra bytes)

[11:15:59] <chronon> Presumably it performs some other task when there's no output, because if it simply waits then you don't need to do anything special.

[11:26:13] <roo-> chronon: The script processes real-time events, the task it performs is rate-limited so it won't execute it too often, as long as there are events it would work fine- but if there are no events for a long period of time, the last events that were 'postponed' won't be flushed until a new event comes along

[11:27:30] <roo-> The need for a timeout is to allow the task to flush such postponed events even if there are no new events for a while
[11:28:46] <chronon> Ok, so the while loop can just check to see if it was entered (from the read) before the due time, and if necessary just sleep until the due time before processing. That's how you would rate limit it, surely?

[11:31:57] <chronon> I am imagining that you are getting output from the util at irregular intervals and if a line of output comes faster than you want to process them, you would sleep before processing it, using the sleep command. But that might not be your goal.

[11:37:51] <roo-> Let me try to mock up a simple scenario: let's say that the events-util produces an event every 1 second, and the task-util (which can handle a batch of events) should only be executed once every 10 seconds
[11:38:23] <roo-> When the first event comes, the task is performed, and for the next 10 seconds it shouldn't be performed again.
[11:39:21] <roo-> Event 2 is being added to the list, and then 3, and then 4, and then 5, ... until the 10 seconds are up when the 11th event comes, and now they are all being flushed to the task-util (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) as a batch
[11:40:30] <roo-> The problem is, if the 11th event comes after a few minutes... the postponed events 2-10 would only be flushed a few minutes later, and I would like them to be flushed at least once a minute

[11:46:40] <chronon> Read can read a partial result and still indicate a timeout in its return value. So maybe that was the cause of something missing?

[14:54:11] <chronon> But you said mine also misses some lines on your system, which is doesn't on mine, so I think there is something genuinely spooky going on.
[14:54:18] <chronon> I really feel sorry for roo. Clearly making this work is important, and the reasons why its not working are infuriatingly elusive.
[14:54:44] <Soliton> as mentioned handling partial reads should be done and makes perfect sense.

[14:55:07] <Soliton> what is weird is how the simple echo|read example behaves for them.
[14:55:22] <Soliton> because those should be atomic write and read.
[14:56:01] <roo-> Soliton: THANK YOU, works fine now.
[14:56:30] <chronon> Oh, I've been running mine for a while and I have an incidence of a partial read being mishandled. Back to the drawing board. Now I'm interested again.

[15:12:27] <roo-> Another piping question... is it guaranteed for: 1.sh | 2.sh, to be line-buffered?
[15:12:57] <Soliton> !faq buffer
[15:12:58] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/009 -- What is buffering?  Or, why does my command line produce no output: tail -f logfile | grep 'foo bar' | awk ...
[15:14:19] <Soliton> for just two bash scripts, i guess so.
[15:15:16] <roo-> Is it a question of the number of scripts, or whether one of the components not being a script?
[15:15:42] <roo-> 1.sh | 2.sh | 3.sh | 4.sh | 5.sh ... is the same as: 1.sh | 2.sh in this regard?
[15:15:54] <Soliton> not at all
[15:16:30] <Soliton> "The most important thing to understand about buffering is that it's the writer who's doing it, not the reader."
[15:16:57] <Soliton> it really depends on the programs involved and how they do io.
[15:17:37] <Soliton> if they don't do anything special then you can influence behaviour with f.e. stdbuf.

[21:46:28] <chronon> Hmmm, that's quite useful. It might even solve the partial input issue.

[21:57:23] <roo-> It prints a same-length line, so it will be easier to see the lines that are shorter, which means they were read partially, and then the following line is the complete line
[21:58:58] <chronon> Hmmm, and why is 128 the cutoff point?
[21:59:10] <chronon> Is that documented anywhere?
[21:59:32] <roo-> Yes, -gt 128 represents it timed out, so it's possible there was a partial read
[22:00:04] <chronon> I noticed that the return code when it timed out was always 142.
[22:00:22] <chronon> But that didn't allow me to make an assumption about 128.

[22:17:21] <chronon> rsync is so good at what it does I would have jumped through whatever hoops were necessary to get someone to install it. But if they allow ssh access then at least you can mount their remote folder as an sshfs mount locally and then use a local rsync to do the syncing.
