[00:00:32] <blkshp> I'd put dTal in charge but...no
[00:00:33] <dTal> SMBC deserves the crown of official nerd webcomic more than xkcd, in my opinion
[00:00:49] <blkshp> ooh and the Sainsburys cake is much nicer than the M&S one
[00:01:08] <arryana> oh yeah
[00:01:09] <arryana> ?
[00:01:11] <dTal> blkshp: you don't have to give me ops but you don't have to insult me either
[00:01:17] <acdw> blkshp it's just about linguistic prescriptivism
[00:01:22] <arryana> i have to make banana bread tomorrow
[00:01:25] <acdw> dTal honestly agree
[00:01:39] <blkshp> dTal: well I don't have to but It's fun.
[00:01:50] <arryana> haha
[00:01:52] <blkshp> arryana: make flapjacks
[00:01:57] <arryana> ooha
[00:02:00] * dTal sets mode +o dTal
[00:02:06] <arryana> that's not a bad idea, but i have bananas to use up
[00:02:30] <arryana> no shortage of oats either, though
[00:02:39] <blkshp> MY favourite thing to make, so simple and I was told my flapjacks were better than the chocolate crunch that a trained pastry chef (turned SDM) makes!
[00:03:55] <arryana> i would love that recipe, if you have it
[00:04:43] <blkshp> 150 125 125 250 I think butter, golden syrup, light brown sugar, oats

[00:05:26] <ro-bot-o> [url] Yummy golden syrup flapjacks recipe | BBC Good Food | www.bbcgoodfood.com
[00:05:39] <blkshp> But I add a pinch of salt and change half light brown for dark brown sugar.
[00:05:41] * arryana screencaptures
[00:05:42] <arryana> ta
[00:06:01] * blkshp nods :)
[00:06:19] <arryana> i never had flapjack until i came here
[00:06:30] <arryana> in the states, flapjacks are pancakes
[00:06:59] <blkshp> Yeah, I've seen, I like to teach Americans about Flapjacks (ones that didn't move to our fair isle of coursE)
[00:07:09] <blkshp> Getting the syrup is the hard bit
[00:07:11] <arryana> they don't really have golden syrup either
[00:07:24] <arryana> kroger carries it in their international aisle
[00:08:16] <blkshp> I'll store that for later!
[00:09:51] <blkshp> ooooh...
[00:10:08] <blkshp> Did I tell you about cornflake tart?

[00:12:21] <arryana> that looks amazing
[00:12:46] <arryana> i love british food, it's really underrated
[00:13:23] <blkshp> These are childhood favourites of me and my friends so I make them every now and again. Proper vanilla custard with that one.
[00:13:30] <blkshp> Sticky toffee pudding as well.
[00:13:39] <blkshp> I like sweet stuff you may have noticed lol
[00:13:49] <arryana> i don't generally eat very sweet things, but once in a while i get a craving
[00:14:05] <arryana> 95% of the time my cravings are for sour things
[00:14:13] <arryana> morrison's gherkins.  the perfect pickle.
[00:14:16] <blkshp> I try to limit the amount of sweet I have too, makes it extra good when you do.
[00:14:26] * arryana nods
[00:14:29] <blkshp> Sainsburys have started selling dill pickles
[00:14:35] <arryana> i just never really got a taste for very sweet or very salty things
[00:14:38] <blkshp> They're very nice
[00:14:41] <arryana> oooh
[00:14:43] <arryana> that'd be worth trying
[00:15:28] <arryana> i read something about cravings many years ago, i can't be positive of the exact terms
[00:15:54] <arryana> but it was something along the lines that if you don't eat anything very sweet or very salty before the age of 2, you never really get a taste for it
[00:16:42] <arryana> i have a marked preference for sour and bitter things

[11:46:51] <arryana> how was night one with the baby?
[11:47:01] <arryana> and ta, coffee would be amazing
[11:47:38] <pussipupu> wonderful, but not much sleep
[11:47:38] * arryana slides half a sausage butty to pussipupu
[11:47:42] <arryana> haha
[11:48:08] <pussipupu> and quite a lot of going outside in the snow so he could do a wee
[11:48:16] <arryana> me nos
[11:48:18] <arryana> bleh
[11:48:20] <pussipupu> cheers, don't mind if I do
[11:48:22] * arryana nos
[11:48:43] <arryana> housebreaking is one of the reasons i crate train
[11:49:02] <pussipupu> We're having unexpectedly late heavy snow, but he loves it and I'm not going to work today so it's fine
[11:49:09] <arryana> woohoo!
[11:49:29] <pussipupu> He understands that outside is the toilet place already (:
[11:49:39] <arryana> tiny is the one with impervious fur, but zoe's the snow lover
[11:49:42] <arryana> that's wonderful.
[11:49:53] <arryana> signs of a good breeder, clearly they've been taught well
[11:50:41] <pussipupu> yeah, the breeder is great with them

[11:51:00] <mycroftiv> nice to hear :)
[11:51:04] <arryana> it makes a -huge- difference
[11:51:11] <pussipupu> The cats are quite unconvinced yet though
[11:51:29] <arryana> you really did get an amazing puppy.  i can't wait to see how he grows up
[11:53:14] <arryana> i had to chastise tiny this morning, she drank some of the cat gravy
[11:53:35] <pussipupu> yeah, he's got brains forming inside that head too
[11:53:41] <pussipupu> always thinking
[11:55:21] <arryana> he's a good working dog

[11:55:51] <arryana> teaching him english should be easy
[11:55:53] <mycroftiv> a good dog who loves to work and share the burden with the troop/tribe is so priceless
[11:58:06] <arryana> oh, my other half deserves a medal.  he came in with a cup of tea for me and told me he put the bins out, which i'd completely forgotten about
[11:58:49] <mycroftiv> i hope you have the needed metals to smelt that medal, unless there is something that smells fishy about the situation to check.
[11:59:04] * arryana sighs
[11:59:07] <mycroftiv> ^^
[11:59:17] <arryana> please don't babble attention seeking nonsense at me
[11:59:33] <mycroftiv> ;;. k.
[12:01:35] <pussipupu> We're teaching him Finnish rather than English, but yes he's very much a sheepdog
[12:01:56] <pussipupu> Bit bull-headed, but wants to be a good boy
[12:10:28] <arryana> finnish is even better
[12:11:09] <arryana> bull headed is good.  it means he'll follow the rules once he knows them
[12:11:49] <arryana> the stubborn ones take rules as law
[12:11:57] <pussipupu> He enjoys pushing the boundaries but also seems to enjoy having them enforced
[12:12:13] <arryana> yep, he's testing and learning
[12:12:14] <pussipupu> He is very unlike a cat in some ways...
[12:12:27] <arryana> he'll do that until he's sure, then he'll be good as gold for a month or three
[12:12:34] <arryana> then he'll turn into a total teenage brat for a while
[12:12:39] <arryana> once that's over, you'll have a great dog

[12:20:59] <pussipupu> this is true, the tricky bit will be explaining which things may be chewed
[12:21:29] <arryana> i highly recommend antlers

[12:23:59] <arryana> pig's ears carry salmonella, rawhide is sheer poison, and horns start to stink when they're chewed
[12:25:17] <amigojapan> They serve pigs ears at the authentic Chinese restaurant I went to recently
[12:26:02] <arryana> as to rawhide, it's dangerous on several levels.  my childhood boxer managed to swallow a piece that was not entirely chewed and it swelled in his intestines.
[12:26:07] <pussipupu> pig ears are ok if the pig population doesn't have anemic salmonella I think
[12:26:17] <arryana> that cost $800 to save his life, he lost several feet of intestine, and was never the same.
[12:26:20] <pussipupu> endemic, not enough sleep...
[12:26:21] <arryana> that was back in the 80s, too
[12:27:36] <arryana> well, they'll stink, if not as badly as horns

[18:21:50] <arryana> i'm a bit saddened by gordon ramsay.  he's off tossing contestants on his 'cooking show' into the ocean off a cliff.  he'd have a -much- better show if he had them use cupboard staples to make a fiull meal, or the usually-unused scrap bits
[18:28:10] <pussipupu> Ramsay's normal on screen persona is just annoying
[18:28:22] <arryana> amen
[18:28:27] <pussipupu> pointlessly confrontational
[18:28:30] <arryana> and the reality is, he's not even hardcore as chefs go
[18:28:42] <arryana> i worked for one german dude who used to fling plates at anyone who talked in his kitchen
[18:28:54] <arryana> one of the waitresses needed nine stitches across the forehead
[18:29:11] <arryana> i worked for another who got so drunk while he cooked that someone had to stand there with a serving fork to jab him when he started to black out.
[18:29:25] <arryana> we found him passed out in the walk in cooler one morning, damned near hypothermic.
[18:29:36] <arryana> both exceptional chefs, to be fair.
[18:30:53] <pussipupu> Sure but that's no excuse for that fuckery
[18:31:13] <arryana> it's not to my taste, my rule when cooking is 'no drama in the kitchen'
