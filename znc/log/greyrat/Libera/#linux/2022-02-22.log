[02:36:10] <jim> oh ok
[02:36:11] <koollman> Bluejeans: it will likely just work without trying
[02:36:23] <moo> won't linux see gpt table once its booted?
[02:36:29] <jim> maybe you should use lvm?
[02:36:32] <moo> then worst case you can boot from usb etc
[02:36:33] <koollman> moo: yes
[02:36:50] <moo> by boot i mean literally just kernel and initramfs etc
[02:36:57] <koollman> worst case you need to mark one partition that is copied to the mbr table that is already there as 'bootable'
[02:36:58] <Bluejeans> yes booting from usb is fine

[02:38:48] <koollman> Bluejeans: you don't need to make a logical partition, you just need the bios to find one partition, maybe
[02:39:06] <koollman> some bios are picky and want to find a partition, others don't care and just want something bootable
[02:39:21] <jim> Bluejeans, if you have a separate hard drive to hold the stuff, then you're totally open as to how you want the drive to be
[02:39:25] <Bluejeans> are you sure
[02:39:32] <Bluejeans> well i will try
[02:39:48] <jim> if it's an old bios, does it have UEFI?
[02:40:07] <Bluejeans> no uefi
[02:40:16] <Bluejeans> only legacymode
[02:40:20] <koollman> Bluejeans: the only parts that deal with partition format before linux takes other is the bios finding a disk that can boot, and the bootloader finding the linux kernel on a disk

[02:42:17] <koollman> if the bootloader is grub, it can deal with gpt already. But it needs to be installed in a way that boots on a non-uefi machine (which is usually done with grub-install or some other tools)
[02:42:18] *** Joins: user95 (~user95@user/user95)
[02:42:41] <jim> if you use LVM, you can put maybe 2 actual partitions on the drive (/boot and lvm physical volume) and then add the LVs to the drive, format them, and restore them
[02:42:42] <Bluejeans> its dualboot windows 10 and linux mint
[02:42:49] <moo> can grub stub (that goes into 512 bytes to load real grub) already handle gpt?
[02:42:55] <jim> are you familiar with LVM?
[02:43:40] <koollman> then if that works the only remaining part is the bios deciding wether a disk is bootable or not. either it is 'stupid' and will just look for the mbr sector and boot it (and that is present if grub is installed), or it is 'smart' and need at least one mbr partition bootable (but you can have a gpt disk with mbr compatible table on it)
[02:43:54] <jim> moo, oh, I see, maybe it's possible to keep the GPT if that's the case
[02:44:25] <moo> also i would guess windows will throw a fit if its gpt install suddenly becomes mbr without uefi :p

[06:49:50] <jim> well I just want it to go with this Art of Electronics (and learning the Art of Electronics) books I got
[06:49:52] <sysRPL> i sit at a laptop and write little electronics test programs in a terminal, and it runs on a small pi zero connected to a breadboard with a 5v battery bank supplyin days worth of power
[06:50:02] <mlu> jim: anything up to 250kHz will be plenty

[06:50:31] <jim> I think I saw one for like 35 bucks
[06:50:39] <mlu> jim: for reference, a 555 timer is good for up to ~50kHz, and the typical cell phone power supply switches at ~230kHz
[06:50:43] <domicron> a piece of coax can solve anything

[06:51:33] <sysRPL> by the way everyone, i highly recommend this robot builging programming and electronics youtube channel -> James Bruton https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUbDcUPed50Y_7KmfCXKohA
[06:51:34] <mlu> above that, and it's all about carriers for radios, etc.
[06:51:38] <CaesarNaykid> i think someone gave me the command up there to view the IDs of my local drives but i can't find it now in the sea of black, i need a new IRC client haha
[06:51:55] <jim> I think my first computer (an 8080) was 2mhz
[06:52:06] <sysRPL> this James Bruton guys has many interesting electronics and programming projects
[06:52:08] <CaesarNaykid> i went into the Windows guest actually and obtained the GUID it sees there, want to compare to what Debian has it mounted as
[06:52:18] <mlu> the clock on a full-sized Arduino is 16MHz and that's on the faster side of things as far as 8-bit goes

[14:59:52] <MeanEYE> soulisson, it should act as a key provider through ssh agent. Just like those key smart cards.

[15:02:20] <jim> can wayland do the whole agent forwarding thing?

[15:03:20] <soulisson_> MeanEYE, ok. "MeanEYE, I'm not sure to understand, will the ssh-agent store the private key in memory or will it interact with the key for authentication?"
[15:03:49] <MeanEYE> soulisson_, it shouldn't be stored anywhere ever. Apart from the key itself. What it will store is password to use it, for configured period of time.

[23:06:57] <Psi-Jack> IBM shut down CentOS-8 shortly after its release and gave it the lowest support TTL ever in the history of RHEL/CentOS.
[23:07:04] <manifest> centos wiki is not a reputable source for EOL info :)
[23:07:04] <Psi-Jack> Which ended 2022.

[23:23:35] <[twisti]> i have a csv file that follows a format and i want to turn it into a csv file that follows a different format (different field order, different date format). it seems like that would be a relatively common problem, is there a cli tool i could look at ?

[23:28:23] <matsaman> [twisti]: normalize your delimiters, then
[23:28:25] <[twisti]> like "foo","doe, john"
[23:28:32] <matsaman> maybe you should use something a little more robust, though, like python
[23:28:37] <moo> csv can be multi-line, quoted or not (even on same lane), single or double quotes, separated by commas or anything else. doubt you can cut it
[23:28:42] <moo> you need real csv parser
[23:28:51] <matsaman> csv is rarely well formatted indeed
[23:29:03] <matsaman> although real csv parsers usually are even stricter about it
[23:29:04] <[twisti]> yeah i saw python has a csv library. i was thinking maybe there was something like jq for csv before going into writing and actual program

[23:35:05] <Psi-Jack> Second, if you want it in ~/Mail or more properly ~/Maildir, you need to deliver mail a different way that does it AS the user, not as the dovecot user.
