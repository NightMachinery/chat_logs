[00:01:10] <sm> lol, a 2015 update: https://store.steampowered.com/app/347660/Caromble
[00:01:20] <sm> they like explosions
[00:03:20] <EvanR> game's been playing autonomously for like 30 minutes now... seems good
[00:03:46] <EvanR> i want to see some memory stats
[00:05:14] <sm> ekg ?
[00:05:24] <sm> drop-down debug console ?
[00:05:45] <EvanR> wasn't there a GHC module to import that showed how big the heap is
[00:05:50] <EvanR> or how much live data
[00:09:09] <sm> maybe ekg is overkill but https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ekg-core-0.1.1.7/docs/System-Metrics.html#v:registerGcMetrics source might be useful
[00:10:39] <EvanR> probably not overkill for a real game
[00:11:48] <EvanR> GHC.Stats ...
[00:18:41] <icrbow[m]> +RTS -S
[00:19:02] <sm> EvanR wants to see it live while running I think
[00:19:07] <icrbow[m]> And then there's a mode that dumps gc stats for every run
[00:21:38] <EvanR> yeah
[00:24:47] <EvanR> memory usage seems to be stable over the course of the last hour
[00:26:12] <icrbow[m]> > The -S flag, as well as giving the same output as the -s flag, prints information about each GC as it happens
[00:28:59] <EvanR> oh cool

[00:38:08] <EvanR> oof, Live Data is generally increasing with time!
[00:38:37] <EvanR> Live bytes
[01:23:30] <sm> https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1630/breaking_down_breakout_system_and_.php is a really nice discussion and survey of general mechanics, without getting into specific details
[01:26:21] <sm> well, maybe it gets into more specifics later. It's huge!
[01:26:33] <EvanR> wow
[01:32:19] <sm> "Some examples of complex balls include: an egg-shaped ball, a square rubber sponge with a rock embedded in one corner, two basketballs connected by a chain."
[01:32:31] <EvanR> lol

[01:39:01] <EvanR> ok I was updating some field of the state but never using it for anything, seems to be the source of the leak. Unsurprising!
[01:46:01] <sm> üëçÔ∏è
[01:47:01] <EvanR> and the static physics now seem semi solid
[01:47:09] <EvanR> or, I don't detect any errors anymore
[01:47:41] <EvanR> I should figure out how to "sweep" the ball out of the way with a fast mouse motion, without breaking things
[01:47:56] <EvanR> though if you sweep it into the wall, ...

[23:55:55] <EvanR> the amount of 'implicit configuration', like constants dictating physics details, is increasing and now I'm wondering whether to just pass it around everywhere or something else
[23:59:23] <f-a> if it is a a flat type, why not
[23:59:38] <f-a> or do ReaderT like fancy kids
[23:59:46] <EvanR> Reader xD
