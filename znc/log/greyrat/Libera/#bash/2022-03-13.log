[04:30:23] <jtgd> I've never seen this happen before. I do a for loop and run a command with & (I want them all to run in parallel) and they immediately report as Stopped. I can fg each one and it runs, but it won't let me run multiple jobs in background
[04:31:58] <jtgd> it doesn't matter if commands are there on command line, or running a function with & after it, or function with & inside of it, or "( command | command ) &", it's the same
[04:32:31] <jtgd> I've been doing bash for decades and this blows my mind.
[04:32:54] <Riviera> jtgd: perhaps they try reading from the terminal
[04:33:11] <jtgd> yes, that did not work.
[04:33:47] <Friithian> I would suggest using gnu/parallel for this to do it better
[04:33:51] <jtgd> I do the for loop up to "do", hit enter, type command with &, enter, "done". same result
[04:34:10] <jtgd> ok, I will try that. thanks
[04:34:13] <Riviera> huh
[04:34:21] <Riviera> what's that supposed to mean, "that did not work"? :)
[04:34:34] <Riviera> perhaps the processes reading from the terminal is the reason for them to be halted
[04:34:39] <Riviera> via the SIGTTIN signal
[04:34:44] <jtgd> by not work I mean that it immdiately reports all jobs as "Stopped"
[04:35:02] <Riviera> and what did you mean with "that" in "that did not work"?
[04:35:52] <jtgd> I am trying to convery audio files in parallel. I try to start them all up to run in background but they stop.
[04:36:04] <jtgd> *convert
[04:36:05] <Riviera> so you're running ffmpeg?
[04:36:08] <Friithian> oh yeah def use parallel for this
[04:36:08] <Riviera> then it's what i said.
[04:36:15] <Friithian> it is a bad idea to just run them all at once
[04:36:15] <jtgd> no, opusenc
[04:36:30] <jtgd> why?
[04:36:39] <Riviera> why to me or to Friithian
[04:37:01] <jtgd> why is it bad to run them all at once? I've done that before
[04:37:04] <Riviera> anyway, see that they don't read from your terminal or that's what's going to happen.
[04:37:28] <Friithian> if you just run a for loop and spawn a lot of ffmpeg processes you'll potentially lock up your system to wait for them to finish as you'd have as many ffmpeg processes converting as you have files, which could be a lot
[04:37:35] <jtgd> like I say I can fg each one and it runs. I don't think it wants to run from terminal
[04:37:37] <Friithian> and spawning a ton of processes isn't good

[06:22:24] <tirnanog> the second of those suggestions assumes that lxc doesn't interfere with the standard input. otherwise, use the first.
[06:24:46] <tirnanog> as for the rhetorical question, variables expand in double quotes. $Fbiz isn't '$Fbiz' - it's the value of the variable named FBiz. in short, don't perform code injection. either pass your user:password tuple as a positional parameter (suggestion 1) or just execute chpasswd directly (suggestion 2).

[06:30:51] <leftyfb> I get what you're explaining, what I don't get it how in the world this was all working before
[06:31:23] <leftyfb> I wonder if I just got lucky across about a dozen different password hashes that none of them had $ or \ in them

[06:31:37] <tirnanog> I can't explain that. especially as crypt passwords tend to lead with $ and a number.

[06:36:33] <tirnanog> !echo
[06:36:33] <greybot> echo outputs a string. echo has many portability problems, and should never be used with option flags. Consider printf instead: printf 'name: %s\n' "$name". http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b | http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/echo+printf
[06:36:59] <tirnanog> even bash, itself, can be inconsistent in how echo works, depending on whether the xpg_echo option is set.
[06:37:30] <leftyfb> well, since we're not using flags and only care about echo'ing a string, where does this break down?
[06:37:31] <tirnanog> for something like this, I wouldn't leave it to chance. just use printf.
[06:37:37] <leftyfb> ok
[06:38:04] <tirnanog> backslash-escape sequences can be treated differently depending on whether xpg_echo is in effect. really, it's a headache.
[06:38:28] <tirnanog> I mean, this is a security sensitive operation.
[06:38:42] <tirnanog> there's just no sense in having to reason with any of that.

[10:12:31] <rairden> is there an easier way than this (http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/024) to set global variables in a for/while loop? Cant get it to work.
[10:13:06] <larryv> easier than what
[10:13:31] <larryv> this page has like 8 techniques
[10:14:06] <tirnanog> !mre
[10:14:06] <greybot> A minimal reproducible example is a small, self-contained command or script that can be executed by someone else, without modification, to concretely demonstrate the problem you are enquiring about. See !paste if it's longer than a few lines.
[10:15:27] *** Joins: willow (~willow@user/willow)
[10:16:06] <willow> trying to create an alias for pwgen to generate secure passwords but excluding certain chars.   this works:  alias pwgen='/bin/pwgen -sy --remove-chars=,\`\"$'
[10:16:29] <willow> however when i try to exclude single quote it causes the alias to fail.  i use \'
[10:17:35] <larryv> you can't \' within single quotes
[10:17:45] <larryv> rather, it doesn't do what you want
[10:18:00] <larryv> anyway, use a function
[10:18:01] <tirnanog> also, to quote the manual, "for almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions."
[10:18:11] <tirnanog> that will remove a quoting layer that you can well do without.
[10:18:15] <willow> ok, will create a function.  thanks

[17:33:55] <boosternath> hey all, quick question. does bash have a hook where I can specify a custom command to run in the case that a command is not found, or "no such file or directory" would appear?
[17:34:22] *** Joins: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix)
[17:34:52] <boosternath> I would like to create a hook that detects git repository URLs, and asks me where I want to clone them
[17:36:00] <lopid> maybe this can help: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashOpenQuestions?highlight=%28hook%29
[17:36:28] <geirha> there is command_not_found_handle
[17:36:55] <geirha> but I'd just write a function and use that instead; a function that takes a git url as argument
[17:38:01] <boosternath> yeah I'll probably do that in the end, but I want to experiment with command_not_found_handle for now - thanks!

[22:27:55] <Soliton> !aliases
[22:27:55] <greybot> Aliases suck. They don't work in scripts. They can't take arguments. They have special evil magical powers that break all expectations. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/080 for starters.
