[00:25:16] <dfdx> Hi #bash. I have a ton of little solutions in bash and awk that I've made for myself regarding various things. I've noticed that instead of the solution being one single bash or awk file, it's a collection of a few bash and awk files. typically I can consolidate all the bash files to one large one, and the same with awk. But is there any general way to combine bash and awk files? I keep them separate for a 
[00:25:22] <dfdx> variety of reasons, the least important of which is syntax highlighting tends to shut-off for awk sub-scripts inside a bash file, the most important of which is probably that it's difficult for me to pass variables between the bash part of the script and the awk part of the script.

[00:26:53] <dfdx> basically, instead of "process1.sh" and "process2.awk", I'd like "process.sh" with awk probably inside somewhere. but passing variables back and forth is really challenging me.

[00:28:23] <twkm> you can invoke awk from bash where the awk script is embedded in the bash script.

[03:53:44] <acidsys> I just compared and $HOME seems to be the same in both environments. But is is possibly $PS1? I never checked it but just found that under the ldap user it returns `user02@suse07:${PWD}>` whilst under a local user it returns `\u@\h:\w>`. I can't seem to find anything online as to where that difference originates from though.. I always thought it's transparent to the shell "where" the user comes from

[03:57:58] <acidsys> yep, the correct home directory (/home/user02)
[03:58:22] <twkm> as long as PWD is used there is no way it'll be turned into a tilde.
[03:59:02] <twkm> you could perhaps change it but whatever you do to change ${PWD} so as to do that could be done to make it \w instead.
[03:59:21] <acidsys> that makes sense but why is that difference / can I (should I even?) change it somewhere?
[03:59:42] <acidsys> I guess overwriting $PS1 by hand is not that elegant
[03:59:54] <phogg> for bash you should use \w or \W depending on your taste

[15:35:09] <Soliton> forward search is ctrl-s.

[15:39:37] <greybot> "tty" originally stood for teletype, a primitive keyboard+printer which was the forerunner of the ASCII terminal.

[16:06:57] <Patsie> I've written awk scripts which have an infinite loop with system("sleep 1") or similar built in. when pressing ctrl-c it will break the sleep call and continue into the next loop, infinitely, even when holding down ctrl-c
[16:07:15] <Patsie> ctrl-s will stop the processing of the awk script, so then I can ctrl-c the program itself
[16:07:21] <Patsie> and not just the sleep call

[22:07:35] <greybot> By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html

[23:41:38] <greycat> implementing the websocket protocol in a bash script looks like a hell of a lot of work (full duplex communications); the sensible thing to do would be find a tool that already implements it, and which is designed to be driven by a scripting language

[23:56:08] <lantech19446> yitz: that is the directory where the results live to be served by the program
[23:56:31] <greycat> configure the web server to serve this static content, and then point your web browser at it
[23:56:31] <lantech19446> once you ctrl c out of the program the results are no longer there
[23:56:41] <greycat> ... what
[23:56:42] <yitz> So ... that's a directory (and not an .html file) that you don't access directly?
[23:56:59] <yitz> Or is it a file that you can open in your browser?
[23:57:14] <yitz> Because those are very different things
[23:57:49] <lantech19446> it's a temporary file served via websocket that is accessed at /var/www/html/report.html but once you exit the program that temporary file goes poof
[23:58:19] <yitz> Is it a regular file on disk?
[23:58:20] <greycat> if you're in a shell on the server, and you run ls -l /var/www/html/report.html what do you see?

[23:58:50] <yitz> It cannot both be a directory and a regular (even temp) file
[23:59:21] <greycat> If it's really a temp file, then configure your web server to serve it up to you with a URL of your choice, and connect to that URL.
[23:59:23] <lantech19446> ok apparently it is a file that lives there I wonder if i can cat it
[23:59:49] <yitz> If it's a file, you can cat it (permissions aside)
