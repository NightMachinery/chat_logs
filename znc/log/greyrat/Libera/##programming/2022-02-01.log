[00:01:01] <sonny> no, you don't have to do anything manual ... I just think you can get sbrm this way
[00:01:50] <sonny> and if you can get sbrm and a gc, then that seems like a win
[00:02:03] <upp> did kate gregory coin sbrm?  i was watching one of her talks the other day..  <3 kate

Or, maybe the other way around. I am not sure what appeared first), so that you can provide more options (aka 'restarts'), and

[02:47:39] <PlanckWalk> Which websites?
[02:47:48] <flakland> wtf is algorithm website
[02:47:49] <senoraraton> Codewars, leetcode etc.
[02:48:10] <flakland> they want to harvest your data

[02:48:14] <PlanckWalk> You mean give you answers before you've solved it?
[02:48:35] <PlanckWalk> codewars and leetcode are website to *test your skills*, not provide algorithms

[02:49:39] <PlanckWalk> If you can't devise algorithms then sure, fall back on trying to memorize all possible algorithms.
[02:50:10] <senoraraton> I devise everything I write by google.  If I need to do something, I spend 15 minutes googling it, and I take the best solution in that time frame.
[02:50:12] <PlanckWalk> The same way you devise solutions to other ptoblems.  Heuristics, reasoning, analysis
[02:50:26] <flakland> looool
[02:50:30] <PlanckWalk> I suppose if you never solve any other problems, then ...
[02:50:37] <senoraraton> I solve problems every day.
[02:51:01] <PlanckWalk> If you have a weak spot on devising algorithms, then maybe practice devising algorithms.
[02:51:18] <flakland> how do those sites stop you from using google?

[03:08:21] <PlanckWalk> I don't need one since I attended a university (which was essentially free), so I can't recommend one, but there are others who know more about which are good.

[03:08:43] <senoraraton> Thats all I care about.
[03:09:06] <flakland> first you must define the problem, and the conditions needed for it to be considered '''''solved'''''
[03:09:07] <PlanckWalk> Seems short sighted but there are places that you can pay to rapidly pass coding tests too.
[03:09:09] <Tech_8> just tell them everyhthing you know and you can research how to do thinngs you dont know
[03:09:17] <PlanckWalk> They're shit, but they apparently work in the short term.
[03:09:38] <vrp2zqL7> If it really is so easy, a class should not be necessary for it.  If it is extremely hard, then even classes may not help.
[03:09:50] <PlanckWalk> A class isn't really necessary
[03:10:14] <PlanckWalk> It's just that most people who succeed at learning this stuff without a class are much better at directing their own learning than senoraraton is.
[03:10:38] <PlanckWalk> So, I'd recommend some structured course

[05:07:45] <ProfSimm> Isn't prefixing symbols with ":" weird, why did Lisp and Ruby settle on it? I.e. :foo
[05:07:54] <ProfSimm> Normally you have ":" after things

[05:11:24] <koollman> ProfSimm: ruby uses ':', lisp does not. 
[05:11:50] <koollman> and the answer is that ruby grammar would be harder to parse without some symbol in front
[05:11:51] <ProfSimm> koollman: I might have spotted this in a dialect of Lisp. What does Lisp use
[05:12:34] <koollman> typically the equivalent idea would be using "'"

[08:21:16] <epony> your bootstrap broke
[08:21:45] <flakland> that'swhat big shoestring wants you to believe
[08:22:22] <epony> you see it does not apply much outside connected and low loss transfer systems
[08:22:55] <epony> time is a high (maximum) loss concept
[08:23:20] <epony> you also can not process or otherwise interact or connect it

[13:44:26] <DPA> And rather than encrypting DNS, they should have said to use DNSSEC. Just encrypting the last resolver won't make anything DNS related more secure. It only causes problems.
[13:44:26] <DPA> If I was in charge, I'd require every public DNS zone to be transfer / copyable, so noone needs to make any requests anymore in the first place, and stuf'd be actually anonymous.

[18:54:36] <pulse> callq, new_price = price - 0.05*price
[18:55:21] <pyzozord> depending on the program, somehow people trust programs on app stores like ios or steam

[18:56:08] <pyzozord> sure that would work
[18:56:31] <pulse> because the project is basically a generic 2d level editor
[18:56:46] <pulse> and i know people will be like "hurr it doesn't have XYZ feature that [this other program] offers"

[21:00:43] <soulisson> ok, this is a dumb question. Is there a difference between an hypervisor and a virtualization software, by that does the term "hypervisor" refer to the whole virtualzation software including components like the GUI, the remote access services or does it refer specifically to the component that "runs" the VMs?
[21:00:52] <soulisson> Apologies for my english
[21:01:00] <eXtr3m0> InPhase yes true, but its kinda lame if 4 people on top of you discuss stuff that they don't really have a clue of and you have to execute their stupid ideas. I refuse to do stuff that is user hostile or just plain inside-out thinking. I think it's also my job as an expert to make sure they understand different perspective. But it's very annoying to do that all the time. :|
[21:01:02] <InPhase> eXtr3m0: When I interview people for technical positions, one of the traits I typically interview for is the ability to interactively extract requirements from people who don't understand technology well enough to actually know what they need or express it adequately.

[21:21:29] <nevdudd> hello, i am attempting to code something in C that outputs a stream of characters to stdout, but at the same time accepts input from the user (stdin) - i have it working, but when a lot of lines of characters are streaming by you cannot keep track (visually) of what you typed - i want there to be a static line at the bottom of the console that
[21:21:29] <nevdudd> doesn't change so i can see what im inputting into the program - anyone able to point me in the right direction?
[21:21:30] <ProfSimm> Also airplanes
[21:22:11] <GeDaMo> nevdudd: you might be able to do something with ANSI escape codes
[21:22:26] <ProfSimm> My point was "yes" and "no" are simple universal words. An we keep reinventing them as "if else"  "true false"   "case default"
[21:22:38] <ProfSimm> We're stupid
[21:22:42] <Decker> goto (a>b);
[21:22:51] <soulisson> Decker, ok, for me the hypervisor, is really the component that allows the VMs to run, to send data,etc and the other components like the remote access services, console application, would be part of the virtualization software but not really part of the hypervisor itself but I'm not sure this is correct :(
[21:22:53] <pulse> (a > b) ? yes : no
[21:23:46] <Decker> soulisson pretty much - it coodinated which of the systems is scheduled to run at the current time; it's the task scheduler for VMs
[21:23:57] <GeDaMo> (a > b) ifTrue: [ 'yes' ifFalse: [ 'no' ]
[21:24:01] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: if you feel too intimidated by writing ansi escape codes yourself you can also checkout ncurses library
[21:24:07] <pyzozord> nvmd: ^
[21:24:24] <GeDaMo> I think outputting ANSI would be easier than trying to learn ncurses :P

[22:17:54] <apotheon> I blame that on how Python isn't really able to consistently keep up within a single overall programming paradigm.  It sorta enforces mixed paradigms in a context-switching way (rather than a seamlessly-both-at-the-same-time way).

[22:28:29] <apotheon> I suspect that almost all startups that grow up to *really massive* size end up having scaling poblems.  It's probably more often a matter of the original codebase not growing well than of the implementation language.
[22:28:53] <apotheon> . . . though there are certainly exceptions, I'd imagine, where the implementation language is actually a significant scale blocker.
[22:29:15] <apotheon> I'm speaking more of execution scale, rather than codebase scale.

[22:37:15] <pulse> that's probably because some C++ programmers just go overboard with obtuse features
[22:37:17] <apotheon> It's quite difficult to de-abstract in C++ when over-abstraction is your problem.  C is much less likely to encourage over-abstraction because it doesn't have turtles-all-the-way-down abstraction facilities like C++.
[22:37:24] <pulse> rather than use idiomatic style that scales well

Make things that do one thing well; group them according to areas of responsibility when grouping is desirable.  Extract code so you don't have parameter overload.  Name data things with nouns, and action things with verbs.  Try to
[22:42:00] <apotheon> keep side effects and return values separate, but try to make every action construct expression-composable.
