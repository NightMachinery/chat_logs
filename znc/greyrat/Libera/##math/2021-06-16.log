[07:33:33] <W> em, ppw, not only did I presume integer k, and the answer "powers of 10" not being entirely correct response to the question I asked (powers of the square root of 10 more like), there's a much simpler answer in simply factoring k^2+1 that I missed and the question probably wants

[07:39:29] <int-e> superboot: in what context?
[07:40:49] <PlanckWalk> In math context, yes there is a function that maps real numbers to their decimal parts.
[07:40:52] <int-e> x - floor(x) works if x >= 0
[07:40:57] <PlanckWalk> (Sometimes called frac)
[07:41:49] <PlanckWalk> Yes, part of the question would be f(-1.3) = 0.3?  or -0.3?  Or 0.7?

[07:43:13] <superboot> Oh, I see. Sorry for the confusion. Yes, positive argument. so, x - floor(x) will work.
[07:43:52] <superboot> int-e: I've not seen that notation around the second x in your latest post. What is it?

[08:05:35] <W> probably because when it's taught, it's either taught as, or perceived as, a solution to the "problem" of square roots not working for negative numbers
[08:05:48] <int-e> Meh, ppw's problem isn't nice... it doesn't specify which operations you're actually allowed to use. f(k) increases by one an powers of 10, and also each time you cross a prefix of sqrt(10) ~ 3.1622776601683795 (so at 4, 32, 317, 3163, 31623, ...) which is trickier to discern. You can do ceil(2*log_10(k)) except when k is a power of 10, maybe that's the intended way?
[08:05:58] <em> W: Yeah absolutely.
[08:06:24] <em> That's probably how I first saw it and then you are kind of blinded by that I guess.
[08:06:28] <W> int-e, I arrived at ceil(2*log_10(k+1))
[08:07:33] <W> like I said, a bit of a bother to prove, and my brain is out of gas so I stopped halfway through after fixing the other problems
[08:08:46] <int-e> W: that doesn't work though if k=3, k=31, or k=316, and so on.

[08:23:40] <int-e> well that's where the problem becomes seriously underspecified
[08:23:45] <pikapika> If a slope is a/b its vector would be along (b,a) right?
[08:23:58] <pikapika> (with tail transposed to the appropriate point)
[08:24:27] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[08:24:28] <int-e> W: I mean no, that doesn't happen when all calculations are exact. But the problem mentioned calculators as a motivation and those have rounding errors... and that makes it very murky.
[08:25:51] <W> anyway I now also realize that ceil(2g)-ceil(g) rounds g to the nearest integer, which is neat
[08:27:06] <int-e> W: the reasoning, formally, is something like: assume that k^2 <= 10^(2n+1) < k^2+1; that's essentially the condition under which ceil(log_10(k^2)) = 2n+1 but ceil(log_10(k^2+1)) = 2n+2. Then, because k is an integer, we must have k^2 = 10^(2n+1) and that never happens.
[08:27:06] <pikapika> int-e, mathematics is a dark and obscure subject
[08:27:21] <pikapika> int-e, in some subjects the rounding error analysis is explicitly done
[08:27:37] <int-e> numerical analysis is a thing

[08:28:54] <int-e> pikapika: but http://mathb.in/57666 gives us nothing to work with really
[08:29:15] <PlanckWalk> I guess you could phrase the problem in terms of computational bounds.
[08:29:19] <W> I mean there are conventions. x is real, z is complex, k is integer
[08:29:23] <int-e> "here's a question, make it formal, then solve it"
[08:29:35] <PlanckWalk> E.g. you need to do it with less than O(n) space for n-digit k.
[08:29:38] <pikapika> hmm
[08:29:50] <pikapika> if the calculator can fit k
[08:29:52] <int-e> And the first step actually involves guesswork, so, meh.
[08:29:55] <pikapika> I assume it can calculte log(k) too
[08:29:55] <PlanckWalk> (Which is pretty straightforward)
[08:30:04] <pikapika> then we can expand it as log10(1-1/k^2) or something
[08:30:19] <pikapika> with the log10(k) added to it outside
[08:30:27] <int-e> pipwhy would you be able to compute 1/k^2 when you can't square k
[08:30:28] <pikapika> with the 2log10(k) added to it outside
[08:30:45] <pikapika> int-e, we might not actually need to calculate it
[08:30:46] <W> int-e, underspecified bounds, like you said :)
[08:30:50] <pikapika> only expand the terms in taylor
[08:31:32] <PlanckWalk> It boils down to computing square root of 10 in suitably bounded space
[08:31:32] <pikapika> oh but yes you re correct
[08:31:37] <W> if the _only_ problem with k^2 is that it's "too large" then 1/k/k might work just fine
[08:31:42] <pikapika> that will still need calculating (inverse) powers of k
[08:32:28] <PlanckWalk> If you're allowed n digits of "working" memory, then you can easily compute n digits of sqrt(10)

[15:42:56] <horseface> hello, i intend on developing a knowledge in mathematics to that required to understand this book which i am reading on quantum mechanics, as they use mathematical notation to describe many such ideas and descriptions.
[15:43:44] <quarterback> To understand quantum mechanics, you need calculus and algebra.
[15:43:56] <horseface> now i am wondering whether there is a good textbook which you could provide me or even a short course which features a curriculum of different resources to attain this knowledge?
[15:44:03] <quarterback> The order of learning math is albebra, trignometry, geometry, calculus.
[15:44:12] <horseface> i see, thank you!
[15:44:25] <quarterback> Its not entirely the same in most curriculums though.
[15:45:00] <quarterback> Are you taking quantum mechanics for university?
[15:45:41] <quarterback> First tell what is your level in math at the present.
[15:46:12] <horseface> no, not university...

[15:48:11] <quarterback> Higher algebra by hall and knight is a bit higher than high school. It is not detailed and only presents introduction to each topic.
[15:49:04] <kxkamil> Dover series can be good for study

[15:49:46] <quarterback> Dover is lightweight I think
[15:50:40] <quarterback> If you are good in calculus, you wont have problems in quantum mechanics.

[16:34:03] <bildramer> so that turned out to be uninteresting. how about this instead: you get a stream of random bits, some (w/ probability p) erased, you get to set them to 0 or 1, the recipient doesn't know which bits those were, can you transmit at a rate of p? what if you don't know p beforehand? what does the code look like? or maybe you can't send anything whatsoever
[16:34:26] <quarterback> Plazma, It takes some months or a year to be familiar with basic math while working on advanced math problems.
[16:35:00] <quarterback> Plazma, That is my estimate. It may take longer depending how deep one wants to go in math.
[16:35:06] <bildramer> if you think of a long-term moving average then clearly you can move it up or down a bit and that's detectable, so the rate must be above 0
[16:35:19] <bildramer> that's one question answered
[16:36:26] <savask> bildramer: Isn't that the usual "communication channel with noise" type of problem?
[16:36:54] <bildramer> nope. in the usual case, you pick the thing to send, nature erases some bits. here, nature picks the random thing to send, you get to alter some bits
[16:37:23] <quarterback> Basic math seems to be based on theorems and proofs. Learning them again seems a bit tough.
[16:37:46] <savask> In the usual setting "nature" flips some bits, not erases them
[16:38:38] <bildramer> I was thinking of an erasure channel, the point is you can't pick ? and send it, that would be trivial
[16:39:02] <bildramer> deletion is different from erasure, btw

[16:40:39] <quarterback> Plazma, Learning the theorems and proofs takes lot of time. It seems they were not meant to be remembered forever.

[17:51:59] <johnkeats6> rubiksdream, so what's that
[17:52:34] <dauggy> rubiksdream: I was asking, bc here they say that the convergence follows from portmonteu theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_of_convergence_of_random_variables#Convergence_in_distribution_to_a_constant_implies_convergence_in_probability
[17:52:59] <dauggy> but instead we can just say that lim <= lim sup
[17:53:02] <dauggy> right?
[17:53:34] <Z-module> yes, even in the extended reals, the limit L of every convergent (including to an infinite value) subsequence has   liminf <= L <= limsup     and if the subsequence there is the whole sequence, those three are all equal.
[17:54:12] <dauggy> thanks Z-module :)

[17:56:54] <rubiksdream> johnkeats6 embaressingly I dont really know how to concisely sum it up (better than the wikipedia page) nor am I really well versed in it (yet?

[21:00:02] <harwiltz> Basically, let's say we have a diffusion process dX_t = f(X_t)dt + s(X_t)dB_t where B_t is a standard brownian motion.
[21:01:11] <harwiltz> Now lets say we are interested in a function J which takes a sample path t -> X_t(omega) for fixed sample omega and returns a real number.

[21:29:11] <quarterback> Yes, r can be 0 too as a circle with 0 radius can have infinite tangents at its circumference. But I am avoid the case r=0.
[21:29:53] <harwiltz> Doesn't r have to be 0 at (a,b) for each curve?
[21:30:03] <quarterback> Your problem seems to use notations I'm not familiar with.
[21:30:39] <quarterback> if the circle is a  point circle then r is at (a,b) but this leads to ambiguities.
[21:30:53] <harwiltz> Oh wait I think I'm misinterpreting your solution
[21:30:57] <quarterback> I think a circle with 0 radius is called a point circle if I remember correctly.
