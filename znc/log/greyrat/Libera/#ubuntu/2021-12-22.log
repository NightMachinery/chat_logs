[00:04:40] <leftyfb> webchat29: ok. At this point, there is no problem with Ubuntu. You do not have an Ubuntu support question. Your issue is with a Windows partition/installation. Regardless of which tool you used that caused the issue. You need to go to #windows or contact Microsoft for help recovering your Windows partition
[00:05:06] <webchat29> leftyfb anyway it wasn't working properly... I couldn't use apt install not update
[00:05:30] <leftyfb> webchat29: ok, then boot to Ubuntu 20.04 and we can help you with that

[04:08:39] <goddard> how can you install kde plasma but keep your gnome and plasma setup completely separate?
[04:09:44] <oerheks> install side-by-side
[04:09:50] <jhutchins> Rumen: That's unusual, but you're welcome to try.
[04:10:11] <goddard> oerheks: don't you find it always has some strange quirks that mess with the system?
[04:10:16] <jhutchins> oerheks: They would share $HOME.

[04:11:19] <sarnold> just unplug one hard drive and plug in the other? :)

[06:07:09] <Um3> Hi all. Is anybody having HTree corruptions with ext4 when activating the large_dir option on 5.x kernels? After reading https://shorturl.at/sCR19 I tried to upgrade to kernel 5.15 and now I'm not able to replicate the bug. However, I still sometimes see errors such as "EXT4-fs error (device dm-0): dx_probe:888: inode #...: block ...: comm rsync: directory leaf block found instead of index block"

[14:54:46] <VIA> thxalot farkan will try and report back
[14:55:54] <farkaan> VIA Are you on xubuntu or Linux mint?
[14:56:12] <VIA> a different distro
[14:56:26] <VIA> but this symbol didnt appear before yesterday.
[14:56:55] <VIA> yesterday i treied to run a game on steam with "proton experimental" and other proton versions (unsucccesfully ... )
[14:57:07] <farkaan> Curious
[14:57:12] <VIA> indeed
[14:57:46] <oerheks> farkaan, we support only ubuntu, you don't have to answer
[14:57:55] <Maik> VIA: what distro are you running? Know that only Ubuntu and official flavors are supported here
[14:58:11] <oerheks> certainly not with such language
[14:58:12] <farkaan> I'm guessing some Debian derivative since apt works
[14:58:39] <VIA> i wasnt aware of that, i thought since ubuntu is ubuntu,. and most ubuntu distros keep the core of it its all the same
[14:58:56] *** Joins: marlinc (~marlinc@user/marlinc)
[14:58:58] <Maik> VIA: Which distro are you using....
[14:59:35] <VIA> the channel my of my specific disctro was so rude, i never returned. autistic, selfish, entitled people who think theyre smarter than other person on this planet ..
[14:59:50] <Maik> that doesn't answer my question VIA
[15:00:08] <farkaan> VIA: `cat /proc/version`
[15:00:14] <pagios> hi what is the equiv of "ip route add 10.0.0.2 dev eth0"  in netplan
[15:00:17] <pagios> i cant find it
[15:00:17] <Maik> please don't fool around and just answer VIA
[15:01:07] <VIA> " oerheks | farkaan, we support only ubuntu, you don't have to answer                 " ... are you tryug to be extra rude/offend me oerheks ?
[15:01:32] <VIA> i had a question, and farkan was a nice person who tried to help me
[15:01:40] <VIA> i appreciate nice people
[15:01:48] <Maik> VIA: mind telling which distro you use, thanks in advance or otherwise move over to #linux
[15:02:09] <VIA> Maik: you did not hekp me with anything or answer my question, why do you demand i answer yours?
[15:02:24] <oerheks> pagios, "ip link" shows the network adapter names, eth0 is the old way
[15:02:34] <farkaan> VIA: Probably best to move to #linux
[15:02:46] <pagios> oerheks: yea but my issue is in the syntax of how to map that to netplan
[15:02:49] <oerheks> most likely enp1s0 or something like that
[15:02:55] <Maik> because other ubuntu based distro's are NOT supported here VIA, THAT's why i asked you 3 to 4 times kindly
[15:03:07] <Maik> don't be so stubborn
[15:03:10] <VIA> noted. #linux might be a good channel. somehow i never look for any channel, people just poiont them out for me, rarely do i join a specific one because i need very specific help
[15:03:25] <Maik> good luck then
[15:03:57] <oerheks> !netplan
[15:03:57] <ubottu> Netplan is a network configuration abstraction renderer which uses YAML descriptions of a network to work with either a NetworkManager or Systemd-networkd "renderer". More information at https://netplan.io/
[15:04:13] <oerheks> that netplan page gives examples
[15:04:22] <VIA> you could have told me that other distros are not supporterd in your very first sentence, ionstead you decided "to ask me for it 4 times ..." this keeps getting better and beter
[15:04:36] <Maik> VIA: i did
[15:04:43] <oerheks> https://netplan.io/reference/#examples
[15:04:47] <Maik> learn to read
[15:04:49] <farkaan> > "#ubuntu supports Ubuntu and official flavors; versions 18.04, 20.04, 21.04, 21.10 | Unofficial derivatives: use your distro's support channel, not here"
[15:04:56] <oerheks> VIA you could read that in the topic.
[15:05:09] <oerheks> enough time wasted
[15:05:14] <Maik> and it's in the channel topic ^^
[15:05:17] <farkaan> Ubuntu budgie is an official flavor innit?
[15:05:22] <VIA> ah IC now im in the wrong you did Maik. apologies for that

[17:48:44] <jkc> farkaan: There is no functional difference between a swap file and a swap partition. They're directly mapped to disk locations in both cases.

[17:49:20] <jkc> cbreak: a swap file can in many cases improve performance, not hinder it. The performance problem comes in when people act like swap is extra ram, which it isn't.
[17:49:21] <farkaan> `swapon` will refuse to work with a sparse file so it's a non issue
[17:49:39] <farkaan> Swapping to a SSD is even better and doesn't 'kill' the disk
[17:50:46] <farkaan> jkc: People see used up swap even at <60% memory usage and assume that their system is running at subpar performance because it's using the disk as RAM which isn't exactly the case

[19:43:01] <jkc> hejux: Seriously, ubuntu is a really good server platform. Going into #ubuntu to try to chase people away from Ubuntu to Alma doesn't make Alma look good as a community.
[19:43:10] <prawat> @hejux : I can't move to Almalinux, decision has been made for ubuntu.... also all the rpms are converted in deb

[19:49:35] <jkc> A great tool to do literally what it says on the tin. And you're kind of wrong, here. https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/netplan.io Arch also has netplan.
[19:50:01] <jkc> Building netplan for RHEL-alikes is easy, they have an RPM spec for it.
[19:50:08] <hejux> jkc: so, you spend hours, days, to learn the syntax of netplan, and then it only works on ubuntu... while i spend days hours on systemd-networkd, it works everywhere...
[19:50:24] <Maik> if you don't have any further ubuntu support questions and just want to discuss thing then please join #ubuntu-discuss hejux
[19:50:26] <jkc> hejux: Takes about two minutes to figure out netplan.
[19:51:01] <jkc> hejux: And it greatly simplifies a lot of the more complicated networkd setups. if all you want to do here is start arguments, you're starting with bad intentions and doing a bad job.
[19:51:18] <jkc> And, for me, netplan works everywhere. :)
[19:51:45] <jkc> hejux: A lack of expertise on your part doesn't translate to a tool being a bad tool.
[19:52:29] <hejux> yeah, i have to agree that i did not know netplan before i search google 'how to configure network on ubuntu'

[23:45:07] <rfm> rwinner, so if you happened to upgrade while the bad version was there you get this mess.
[23:45:41] <rfm> rwinner, since nobody seems to have done anything about it in 7 months, you could be waiting a long time for the fix.
[23:47:13] <ayla> how to stop snapd from installing automatically when installing unrelated packages with apt?
[23:48:24] <SantaCoz_> ayla,  not sure but try  --exclude  when updating in terminal
[23:48:54] <SantaCoz_> --exclude (name of package(s)

[23:49:27] <ayla> I tried to apt-mark hold snapd but after rebooting it seems not to hold snapd anymore for some reason

[23:54:13] <rwinner> rfm, ah...OK, thanks. I'll wait a little longer. So far it's just build-essential that seems to trigger it. Thanks!

[23:56:49] <rfm> rwinner, if you look at comment #15 in that bug it has an awk script for downgrading all (and only) the bogus libc6 packages, which is much less scary than uninstalling dependencies...
