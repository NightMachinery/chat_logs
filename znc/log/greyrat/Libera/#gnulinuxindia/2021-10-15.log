[20:31:52] <gtlsgamr> What are you all doing today?
[21:56:40] <iamak[m]> If I remove Xorg and install Wayaland it should work out of the box right? (Given that I have proper de and stuff)
[21:56:49] <iamak[m]> No nvidia gpu
[22:16:00] <Arya[m]> <iamak[m]> "If I remove Xorg and install..." <- noxneed to rm xorg
[22:16:17] <Arya[m]> in fact u need it for xwayland
[22:16:41] <Arya[m]> just install sway 
[22:16:50] <Arya[m]> and xorg-xwayland
[22:17:03] <Arya[m]> most stuff should work outof the box
[22:17:11] <Arya[m]> other than screensharing
[22:17:40] <Arya[m]> for which you need slurp and xdg-desktop-portal{,-wlr}
[22:17:57] <Arya[m]> if you have systemd its pretty simple
[22:18:08] <Arya[m]> in void  i had touse some workarounds
[22:18:17] <Arya[m]> Arya[m]: you need pipewire too btw
[22:20:07] <Arya[m]> Arya[m]: with dbus
[22:20:27] <Arya[m]> you  needseatd for most wayland xompositors
[22:20:41] <Arya[m]> its inthe std repos of arch
[22:21:50] <Arya[m]> #swaywm:matrix.org is there for more help if needed
[22:23:11] <Arya[m]> <iamak[m]> "No nvidia gpu" <- it can actually work if you havean optimus laptop (onyl in laptop screen) with the --my-next-gpu-wont-be-nvidia flag. It willwork with neoveau  but who uses it :)
[22:23:25] <Arya[m]> * it can actually work if you havean optimus laptop (onyl in laptop screen) with the --my-next-gpu-wont-be-nvidia flag. It willwork with neoveau  but who uses it ðŸ˜‰
