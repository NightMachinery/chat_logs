[01:25:52] <lantech19446> does anyone ever have days where even though they haven't done anything particularly above and beyond the imposter syndrome just seems to melt away and you feel really good for once
[01:26:17] <rawtaz> aaaahem
[01:26:18] <rawtaz> nope
[01:26:34] <rawtaz> :P
[01:26:38] <kubblai> occasionally then the following day kicks my ass and i forget
[01:27:04] <rawtaz> i must do something really valuable for my imposter syndrome to go away i think
[01:27:16] <rawtaz> like, not touch anything related to IT, so i dont screw anything up
[01:28:11] <lantech19446> I've been touching stuff all day and even got some stuff done it just wasn't stuff that's particularly out of the ordinary I rebuilt a few computers but for some reason I feel really good today and not at all doubtful about my competence
[01:28:25] <rawtaz> thats good
[01:28:41] <rawtaz> you run what was it, a library, IT, theres no reason for you to have imposter syndrome
[01:29:03] <rawtaz> everything is relative, there will always be other folks who know more and who know less than you
[01:29:41] <lantech19446> mine started when I began looking at other jobs and realized that in order for me to get another job I need to learn like everything
[01:30:29] <rawtaz> just because job A expects skills B-Z doesnt mean anyone actually has those skills
[01:30:32] <lantech19446> like I went to school for this but 13yrs in a very small network with no budget and crippling depression my skills got very stagnant 
[01:32:34] <lantech19446> that's part of why I enjoy learning devops tools so much I finally am feeling better and learning things like ansible and docker make me feel alive I know for a lot of you it's everyday stuff at this point but for someone who's never laid hands on an enterprise network this tech is so cool to me
[01:35:46] <lantech19446> fuck that reminds me I wanted to build a backup webserver in a container just to say i did it
[01:38:13] <dubiousness> lantech19446: nobody who applies for jobs has everything on the 'required' list
[01:38:28] <dubiousness> Good work for picking up docker and Ansible though, have fun with it

[01:41:15] <lantech19446> I feel like I don't have anything they're looking for because everything i'm looking at is in bigger networks
[01:44:13] <dubiousness> lantech19446: are you looking at network automation specifically?
[01:45:30] <lantech19446> not yet no I really don't know enough yet I've only just started
[01:45:49] <dubiousness> lantech19446: but is that your are of interest? "devops" is a wide ranging term
[01:45:55] <dubiousness> Just thinking over some starting points
[01:46:22] <lantech19446> I don't really know yet, I do find it interesting but i was thinking it's too soon to pick a specialty
[01:47:03] <dubiousness> lantech19446: that's fair, don't let the "requirements" lists overwhelm you though, the first step is ignoring a lot of what HR think is acceptable to put on a job posting
[01:47:56] <rawtaz> more or less 80% of what i see in job ads is just bullshit
[01:52:54] <lantech19446> I think i'm gonna be stuck here for a while longer anyway, if i don't get a job making enough to afford these health benefits on the open market i'll be screwed
[01:54:45] <rawtaz> the current one isn't that bad after all, is it?
[01:59:23] <lantech19446> no I love my job but i need to make significantly more money to be comfortable
[02:02:48] <slaughter> lantech19446 what kind of numbers do you need for that comfort?
[02:02:57] <slaughter> Ballpark is fine, not trying to dig into your personal life :P
[02:03:36] <rawtaz> screw you, i want to know the pennies
[02:04:18] <slaughter> Actually yeah I'm with rawtaz I need itemized
[02:05:27] <lantech19446> slaughter: my health insurance costs about 20k a year and I need at least 60-80 on top of that to be able to do the things I want to do in life and still save some
[02:06:05] <slaughter> ...and you're US based, right?
[02:07:01] <rawtaz> so you feel you need 100k USD per year in salary before tax?
[02:13:39] <lantech19446> yes to US based and between 80 and 100 yes
[02:14:07] <lantech19446> right now i make about 30 but i only pay 70 dollars a month for the insurance and i don't do a lot of what i'd like too
[02:17:31] <slaughter> WHAT
[02:17:34] <slaughter> 30k?!
[02:18:01] <slaughter> I mean the cheap-ish insurance is great and all but holy shit you're getting robbed. 
[02:19:00] <slaughter> With the skills it seems like you have and the skills you're trying to get...80k should be a bare minimum. 
[02:19:25] <rawtaz> hm perhaps i should get a real job lol
[02:21:28] <lantech19446> slaughter: I know man I've had this job since 2008 and when I got it it took me 7mos to find it because of the economy
[02:22:09] <slaughter> Well the world is very different now, you should be able to get a job just based on the 14 years at that job
[02:22:12] <lantech19446> I went from making 4k a month to making 0 in 2wks in 2008
[02:22:40] <slaughter> Are you in like the deep south or something?
[02:22:57] <lantech19446> just outside philly
[02:25:06] <slaughter> Good lord dude. You don't need to worry about more skills, you need to start applying. You could be making 100k+ with employer-covered healthcare at a remote position no problem
[02:25:53] <slaughter> And if I sound pushy it's because I hate seeing people get taken advantage of <3w
[02:25:57] <slaughter> <3*
[02:26:36] <lantech19446> most of the employer covered healthcare isn't gonna be good enough for me and my wife that's why I need to buy it we both use dme i have a lot of mental healthcare stuff too
[02:27:13] <slaughter> Not trying to be as condescending as this will sound: have you seen what kind of coverage employers offer tech workers these days?
[02:27:26] <slaughter> AKA are you _sure about that_?
[02:28:21] <lantech19446> obviously if they offered something comparable i'd take it but most of the recruiters have lead me to believe that the benefits offered aren't very good especially when compared to what i have now by virtue of it being a government position
[02:31:46] <slaughter> Mmm I'll give you that, gov insurance offerings probably pretty good. So right now I'm paying for the step above employer paid, which is ~130/mo for me and my wife. For that 130/mo I get Anthem platinum PPO 250/20%/3500 - I barely know what these things mean, probably mean something to you 
[02:32:06] <rawtaz> so try to find a better paying govt job
[02:32:22] <slaughter> But also once you're making 3x or more than you are now those $25 copays become somewhat meaningless
[02:32:51] <lantech19446> i'm assuming that the 3500 is a deductible, I guess if i was making 100,000 a year a deductible wouldn't be horrible, it would sink me right now though
[02:33:37] <slaughter> 3500 is out of pocket max. 250 is deductible. 20% is coinsurance cost
[02:33:41] <slaughter> (just pulled it up to check)
[02:33:45] <lantech19446> this last year has been the best for me getting the right meds finally getting off 4 diabetes meds cutting two blood pressure pills in half, even with the benefits i have it's like 100 dollars less a month in pills
[02:34:12] <lantech19446> wow a 250 dollar deductible is nothing i'd spend that in one therapist visit lol
[02:35:11] <slaughter> I'm not sure what the mental healthcare situation is exactly (I'm actually technically not insured until the 1st so some things are a bit hidden) but I recall someone saying it's basically covered. Especially if you're making 6 figures
[02:35:30] <slaughter> And IME this is not an uncommon situation for tech companies on the west coast
[02:36:07] <slaughter> It's all kinda the same, give or take a couple hundred in premiums depending on what the employer pays. No one gets shit insurance for fear of not being able to hire
[02:36:55] <lantech19446> so essentially look for something on the left coast cuz the people out here are sheisters 
[02:37:17] <slaughter> Yerp
[02:37:54] <slaughter> Also salaries are higher over here in general so unless the company does CoL differentials for salary you'll probably make more money. And even if they do, you just won't make as much money as someone in LA
[02:38:50] <slaughter> For some reference on this, I make almost 5x what you do with 5 years of industry experience. That is all as a dev or devops, so it's got some weight, but it's not 15 years of experience.
[02:39:30] <lantech19446> I can't code worth a shit 
[02:40:32] <slaughter> With your skills you don't really need to
[02:40:38] <slaughter> Can you debug a VPN?
[02:40:45] <slaughter> Can you manage servers?
[02:41:21] <slaughter> Shit man even a support engineer at $RANDOM_COMPANY out here makes more than that. I have a friend who's got a little less experience than you doing support engineering in the 100k range. 
[02:41:27] <slaughter> And again, remote
[02:42:06] <slaughter> I'm rooting like hell for you, I would absolutely love to see you say you got the job if the job pays more than 30k
[02:42:12] <lantech19446> I've never done anything with a vpn but i can't imagine it's too difficult especially if you can google
[02:42:34] <lantech19446> managing servers is most of my job and as long as i don't have to write the security shit for it i'll be good
[02:44:09] <rawtaz> slaughter: what makes that friend of yours worth 100k yearly salary?
[02:44:14] <rawtaz> thats mindblowing to me

[04:03:18] <slaughter> Uhhh experience and also that's just what the salaries are like out here
[04:03:34] <slaughter> He did work at Google (as a contractor) for a bit which helps him somewhat
[04:03:57] <rawtaz> how much experience with what?
[04:04:05] <rawtaz> also does he have some computer science education?
[04:04:19] <slaughter> Something like 10 years experience in various IT/support engineering roles
[04:05:05] <slaughter> I think generally he's done a little of everything, kinda whatever you'd expect from those positions. Networking a bit here, device management there, ticketing over there etc
[04:05:15] <rawtaz> holy mother fucking shit
[04:05:51] <slaughter> And no, no CS education. He did a code school last year but didn't really pick it up like he needed so nothing concrete to show in that realm
[04:06:02] <rawtaz> compared to that guy i should have like four-figure k USD salaries
[04:06:45] <rawtaz> it really blows my mind if a person with that level of experience and all-aroundness gets that much of a salary (IMO much, but clearly i am behind in the mastery of salary understanding :D)
[04:08:18] <slaughter> https://komonews.com/news/local/median-seattle-household-income-tops-100000-but-many-make-much-less
[04:08:30] <rawtaz> i will go as far as to call it "saladry understanding" just to make a point!
[04:08:44] <slaughter> When the median is 100k and you're working in tech with experience it just kinda comes out that way :shrug:
[04:10:10] <rawtaz> lucky one.
[04:10:20] <rawtaz> (of many, it seems)
[04:11:17] <slaughter> My very very very first dev job - literally fresh out of code school - was for 70k, and it turned out later I got lowballed (not mad about that though, cuz' here I am)
[04:12:10] <rawtaz> heh ok
[04:12:40] <rawtaz> thanks for being honest and clarifying this
[04:12:51] <slaughter> Talking about salaries is good for the gander
[04:12:51] <rawtaz> made me feel like shit so ill just go bury myself now :P
[04:13:05] <slaughter> Well you're in somewhereelseland so things don't necessarily translate
[04:13:08] <rawtaz> not so sure aobut that. only if youre on the right side of the fence
[04:13:22] <slaughter> Especially compared the the US, salaries here vs elsewhere are always shocking
[04:13:38] <rawtaz> i hope youre right
[04:14:24] <rawtaz> i did speak with a friend a couple of weeks ago who had like 115k USD per year and that is considered pretty good here in sweden
[04:14:49] <rawtaz> or well, good, not just pretty good
[04:15:16] <rawtaz> what are the taxes like for you if you have like 100k per year? how much of that do you actually get to keep in your pocket?
[04:15:34] <slaughter> The average salary in Stockholm is 1/3 that of Seattle, so yeah 115k USD would be pretty stellar
[04:16:59] <slaughter> So when I was making 115 my take home was around 90k after taxes and insurance
[04:17:16] <rawtaz> now it starts to make sense that another friend from the SF area told me to move there and get some work to get some proper pay lol
[04:17:36] <rawtaz> ooh hmm so thats about 22% tax then
[04:18:13] <rawtaz> here in sweden we pay about 30-32%, but it goes up the more you earn.
[04:22:51] <slaughter> Yeah with my new position and salary it's going to increase but due to the way the taxes work I'm not totally sure how much yet
[04:22:59] <slaughter> Napkin math aside, ofc
[04:23:26] <slaughter> Also moving to a state that does income tax vs a state that did sales tax, that's gonna hurt
[04:26:45] <rawtaz> what is sales tax in the context of salary?
[04:27:20] <rawtaz> oh wow, speaking of monies now, warren buffet just mailed me from his new e-mail address cherifouallassani06@gmail.com
[04:28:23] <slaughter> Nothing in the context of salary, just some states do sales tax instead of income tax with the presumption that people who earn more will spend more 
[04:28:37] <slaughter> zomg is he going to give you class A Berkshire stock?
[04:30:57] <rawtaz> heh nah, just a place to stay and some contacts to be hired by :)
[04:31:15] <rawtaz> but im not going. i cant stand the US privacy invasiveness
[04:31:15] <slaughter> I mean Mr Buffet :P
[04:31:17] <rawtaz> and what not
[04:31:19] <rawtaz> ooh right :)
[04:31:38] <slaughter> Hmm I'm not disagreeing at all but I'd be curious to know what in particular you mean
[04:31:41] <rawtaz> the mail is empty :( only the subject line was there. boring.
[04:31:42] <slaughter> RE: privacy
[04:33:34] <rawtaz> well i could pull the simplest card of them all and just refer you to the NSA spying on all the american people
[04:33:42] <rawtaz> spying/collecting intelligence on
[04:34:09] <rawtaz> and then some NSA suit stating in an interview that Snowden has betrayed trust..
[04:35:34] <slaughter> Yeah that's a thing. And really sucks to know that outside of becoming a total reclusive tech shunning off grid weirdo I can't escape it. Bet your ass my phone company will bend over backwards for the NSA
[04:36:09] <rawtaz> yeah totally they will
[04:36:45] <rawtaz> so well thats an easy example. theres plenty of others in terms of the govt or police or whatever having registers where they collect information that they shouldnt and so on
[04:36:53] <rawtaz> but even that is too simple of an example
[04:37:06] <slaughter> I take some solace knowing that despite that I'm not really at risk of anything from them. For now, while laws stay what they are. And I also realize the stupidity of the entire previous statement. I just gotta have something to not be paranoid as hell
[04:37:49] <rawtaz> one of the things that made me decide that i'd never bother even trying to go to the US (even though im sure it'd be very nice and lovely in many ways) is the applications and forms you have to fill out to go there,the information they request from you and about your family etc, as well as how they treat people.
[04:37:57] <slaughter> And every time some new creepy thing comes up (EARN IT being a prime example) I make noise and contact my reps etcetc, though that doesn't undo the existing damage
[04:38:35] <slaughter> Yeah the visa process is apparently shitty. Though dunno what you mean by "as well as how they treat people" specifically
[04:38:40] <rawtaz> its one thing with the regular folks, im sure most would welcome tourists and so on, but pretty much all of the govt and similar just indirectly screams "get the fuck out of here, we are not interested in having any genuinely nice people come over here"
[04:40:17] <rawtaz> well for example i had a friend visit the US a number of years ago and she told me that at the airport there was a place where there was a yellow or so line on the floor, i think it was before the security checks, and her impression from the guards there was that if she stepped across that line they'd more or less just shoot her. might not be the case, but that was the impression the environment in that place. thats not welcoming. and all the questions they ask
[04:40:33] <rawtaz> i mean, for fucks sake. if i go there, and dont have anything fishy in my luggage, then what the hell are you expecting me to do anwyay.
[04:40:46] <rawtaz> stop being suck fucking paranoid freaks.
[04:41:03] <slaughter> Hahahaha ohhhh the TSA yeah
[04:41:07] <rawtaz> i guess it doesnt help when most of the security folks seem to enjoy their powers
[04:41:15] <rawtaz> hah yeah the TSA i suppose thats it :D
[04:41:23] <slaughter> They definitely make things seem scary. I hate flying almost purely because of the TSA
[04:41:47] <rawtaz> oh, thats sad
[04:41:50] <slaughter> They're basically like security guards, but also not, but also are, but also not
[04:41:51] <rawtaz> cuz flying is awesome :D
[04:41:55] <rawtaz> haha yeah
[04:42:05] <slaughter> Really once you learn the patterns it's just an annoyance but I've had my issues
[04:42:29] <rawtaz> oh and, as you probably know, they LOVE showing off their new TSA keys that can open any common bag lock, by putting a photo of it on the internet. so that everyone can now open those locks :P
[04:42:46] <slaughter> Lol yes I also watch defcon videos 
[04:42:51] <slaughter> That makes me cringe so hard
[04:48:28] <rawtaz> ok so i tried to find again an application form that my friend had to fill out (and showed me) those years ago when she went to the US for a couple of weeks. i cnat find the same one now, but i started filling out an ESTA application at https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/
[04:49:15] <rawtaz> i entered the basic stuff and now got to the first set of fields that i think are unreasonable. they want to know my parents names and also my employment status and the contact info for my employer.
[04:49:28] <rawtaz> none of that is their business and is compeltely irrelevant to me visiting the US, IMO.
[04:49:59] <slaughter> Mmmmmmm sorta agree but also don't agree with that
[04:50:44] <slaughter> I mean, "terrorism" aside (which is actually valid sometimes, but still), there's legitimate reasons to check that
[04:50:49] <rawtaz> yup. i thikn its my personal business. the thing is this; my parents has NOTHING to do with this. im a grown up person, *i* am the one visiting. they can go fuck themselves about knowing about my parents.
[04:51:17] <rawtaz> why? my parents have nothing to do with my trip.
[04:51:35] <rawtaz> just as much as my friend X has nothing to do with my trip, or my dog, or my grandparents, or my grand grand parents, etc.
[04:51:48] <rawtaz> its just a random thing to ask about my parents
[04:51:51] <slaughter> Well let's say your parents are, idk, spies
[04:52:13] <slaughter> Or your parents are the CEOs of a Swedish business that is doing a deal with a US company
[04:52:22] <slaughter> Or they're on a wanted list
[04:52:29] <slaughter> Or they're banned from traveling to the US for some reason
[04:52:29] <slaughter> etc
[04:52:46] <rawtaz> yeah, but so what. its my trip and not theirs. they have nothing to do with it
[04:52:53] <slaughter> I don't disagree with you on principle, but I can see a lot of validity to the questions
[04:53:25] <rawtaz> if they according to that rationale neeed to check my parents, then theey would need to cheeck ALL of the ppeoplf i know, becauuse the suggestion is that SOMEONE in my relations is suspicious or need to be checked.
[04:53:40] <slaughter> Well if your parents were doing business with a US company and you're here on a non-work visa and it turns out you're here to do business
[04:54:57] <slaughter> And if they're banned from traveling to the US for some kind of contraband reaason? Hmm maybe you are now playing mule
[04:55:02] <rawtaz> if i was going to the US to do business i wouldnt be using a non-business VISA :) so thats hardly reason to ask about my parents, who have nothing to do with my trip
[04:55:05] <slaughter> Again, I agree on principle, I just see the validity
[04:55:18] <slaughter> [05:25:02 PM]  <rawtaz> if i was going to the US to do business i wouldnt be using a non-business VISA :) so thats hardly reason to ask about my parents, who have nothing to do with my trip > but people totally do this exact thing _all the time_
[04:55:51] <rawtaz> even if that is true, that people do that all the time, how does it help to know the name of my parents? how does it stop any of that?
[04:56:07] *** Joins: Sayona_ (~Sayona@user/sayona)
[04:56:12] <rawtaz> the key to stopping that is to ask "are you here to do any business?" and point out that if oyu are you need a different kind of visa
[04:56:13] *** Quits: Sayona (~Sayona@user/sayona) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:56:17] <rawtaz> my parents' names wont help with that
[04:56:43] *** Sayona_ is now known as Sayona
[04:57:21] <slaughter> Optimistic answer: so they don't have to grill every single person coming through the gate
[04:57:32] <rawtaz> and regarding mule, its the same. them knowing the names of my parents will not in any way make them know more or less if i am attempting to be a mule for someone (which also links to the fact that my parents arent any more relevant in this context than anyone else - its rather like other people in my life were to be more relevant)
[04:57:34] <slaughter> If you have enough info you just wave 99% of people on by
[04:57:56] <slaughter> But really the actual answer to all of the above is almost 100% "September 11th, 2001"
[04:58:32] <rawtaz> well i dont buy it. they have absolutely no business investigating my parents or other people in my life just because *i* as an individual on my own make a trip
[04:59:45] <rawtaz> now the questions in this form became too complex to enter dummy information in so  cant go any further with it.
[05:00:43] <rawtaz> but i do remember form my friends form that they also wanted to know stuff about e.g. my parents, things like whether THEY had been convicted of crimes, and a bunch of other things. again these are 100% not relevant to ME. they are completely separate individuals, its not THEM who are saying they want to come over to the US.
[05:01:03] <rawtaz> its all just utter bullshit. so fuck america. suck an insanely stupid fucking pile of idiots running it.
[05:01:20] <slaughter> I wanted to see what the process for visiting Sweden but y'all's shit goes in circles so I can't even find a fake application
[05:01:50] <rawtaz> seriously, they allow guns to no end, so that everyone can go around killing each other, but theyre super duper scared of the rest of us that havent even seen a gun once in our entire life
[05:02:02] <rawtaz> yeah, i bet youll find some examples to hit me back with :(
[05:02:05] <slaughter>   <rawtaz> now the questions in this form became too complex to enter dummy information in so  cant go any further with it. -> you wouldn't want to enter dummy information anyway. They _will_ verify this stuff and they _will_ pull you into a room to find out why you lied
[05:02:23] <slaughter> I can't find anything, it's literally a circular web of pages
[05:02:35] <rawtaz> well yeah but im not entrering any of my info so this is just a dummy test that theyre not linking with me
[05:02:36] <slaughter> Go to this site to apply -> go to this site to apply -> go to this site to apply
[05:02:49] <slaughter> I think I'd actually have to apply through the US State Dept's embassy there
[05:03:01] <slaughter> Ah ok, just FYI don't fucking lie on that if you ever do fill it out
[05:03:04] <slaughter> They're going to check it
[05:03:14] <rawtaz> yeah
[05:03:34] <rawtaz> i would honestly, seriously, expect htat even if i DO fill it out completely seriously, they would still suspect me of lying at some part of it.
[05:04:32] <slaughter> Mmmm unless you have some criminal history I doubt it
[05:04:43] <slaughter> I get what you're saying but people visit the US all the time
[05:04:44] <rawtaz> if nothing else we would end up in a situation where they'd ask TOO detailed shit about me and id say im not going to answer that and instead of being logical and realize the simple fact that not everyone's privacy is to be violated, they assume that they know that i am therefore a super suspect person that is trying to blow up the USA or something. because thats how they work, isnt it
[05:05:03] <rawtaz> theres like no way they can have a sane rational thinking, they all just think everyone is out to do something bad.
[05:05:48] <rawtaz> what about when you do have people who have been wrongly convited of what government calls a crime then? i can only presume it will mean you cannot visit the US, even if you wanted to.
[05:06:06] <slaughter> Correct. Same for a lot of countries
[05:06:24] <slaughter> You can't enter Canada if you have any criminal history (felonious)
[05:06:40] <rawtaz> i mean relatives, not you yourself
[05:07:18] <rawtaz> which by the way is still insane. if a person has been convicted of what some government calls a crime, and then served a penalty for that, then.. its done. its over with. they shouldnt be punished for life by not being able to go anywhere.
[05:07:26] <slaughter> Oh well unless the crime is something ridiculous like terrorism or extortion or mass murder or something I'm sure it wouldn't come up
[05:07:38] <rawtaz> the amount of incorrect convitions is stunning, both in the US and in other countries
[05:09:08] <rawtaz> hahaha wtf, https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Sweden.html still says dont travel to sweden due to high COVID-19
[05:09:55] <slaughter> OK so Sweden at the least would want to have access to my bank records, tax returns, a letter from my employer saying I was approved to leave the country, and "Documents demonstrating the applicant’s social and professional status."
[05:09:56] <rawtaz> ok so that page does say "TOURIST VISA REQUIRED: Not required for stays under 90 days"
[05:10:09] <rawtaz> i wonder if that means you can just go here. i suppose you still have to fill SOMETHING out :o
[05:10:13] <slaughter> But also I wouldn't need a visa if I had a passport, which also presumably you wouldn't to visit the US either
[05:10:52] <slaughter> Yes, the advisory is just an advisory
[05:10:59] <rawtaz> that might be the ESTA thing yeah, not needing a visa, but presumably still needing a passport
[05:11:38] <slaughter> From what I understand you need a passport to leave the US period
[05:12:01] <rawtaz> on a related note, this is one of the great things about the EU. i can travel freely within the EU, usually i dont even need to show a passport, but one should carry it anyway. but theres none of this crap, you can just go :)
[05:12:24] <slaughter> Also yeah the advisory for Sweden seems...unnecessary, especially right now
[05:13:09] <rawtaz> this is funny too, under the safety and security "tab":  "Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad"
[05:13:43] <rawtaz> i can assure you that theres noone in this country, be it swedes or any other nationality, that is trying to target americans :) so this text is just silly
[05:14:13] <rawtaz> i read in the news the other day that there were no deaths at all due to covid, not sure if it was just about one single day's statistics or not though
[05:14:17] <slaughter> But how else are they going to fearmonger
[05:15:00] <slaughter> Yeah looks like no deaths in sweden since the 20th
[05:15:01] <slaughter> Nice!
[05:15:33] <slaughter> I don't think you're really wrong about anything regarding the US, but I'd also urge you to come check it out sometime. I'm biased but it's pretty rad, and it's a real big country so there's so much to see
[05:15:47] <slaughter> Sweden is on my short list. All of Scandanavia 
[05:16:12] <slaughter> Just to go to a Finnish bar and listen to people talking that weird shit on it's own is a good enough reason to me :P
[05:16:29] <rawtaz> i would love to check it out :) theres lots of places that would be awesome to see, i could spend months there hehe
[05:16:37] <rawtaz> but its just not doable, i have too high level of integrity
[05:16:53] <rawtaz> over my dead body that i'd tell your government about my family and so on
[05:17:03] <rawtaz> they can figure it out if they want to of course, but im not giving it to them
[05:17:13] <rawtaz> so its an unfortunate fact :(
[05:17:19] <rawtaz> ill have to watch photos and videos instead
[05:17:46] <rawtaz> so you're target a finnish bar in sweden? :D
[05:18:06] <slaughter> I'm sure you've heard Finnish people speak
[05:18:11] <rawtaz> yeah
[05:18:27] <slaughter> Anywhere they're speaking I want to just have a beer and listen and try not to laugh/vomit/cry/melt
[05:18:49] <rawtaz> kinda seems to me that you basically just can grab your passport and take a flight over to sweden and you'd get in (if you stay less then 90 days)
[05:18:57] <rawtaz> well besides the travel ban currently
[05:19:03] <rawtaz> hahaha yeah
[05:19:08] <rawtaz> youd love it for sure
[05:19:17] <rawtaz> but then you should go to finland!
[05:19:30] <rawtaz> you can just take the boat across the pond. or walk over :P
[05:19:41] <slaughter> Yeah travel bans all over the place would make it a bit difficult
[05:20:02] <rawtaz> i guess we'll see another wave of covid soon this year :<
[05:20:15] <slaughter> I also don't have a passport because I'm from a rural area and international travel was just a totally silly concept for so much of my life and I haven't had a need so I just haven't got one
[05:20:19] <slaughter> Yeah probably
[05:20:24] <slaughter> Hope not but probably
[05:20:34] <rawtaz> theres apparently a subversion of omicron now, that they say is more infectious or spreading faster, but not more severe
[05:20:49] <rawtaz> oh ok. how would you get a passport if you waaaaaaaaanted one, is itt a complex process?
[05:21:05] <rawtaz> sorry my kbd is acting up
[05:21:26] <slaughter> Nah just get a passport photo and submit an application, wait a bit, passport
[05:21:46] <slaughter> I'm sure they'll ask for a stool sample or something but my understanding is taht the wait is the only "hard" part
[05:25:08] <rawtaz> the wait for the stool is the hard part
[05:25:09] <rawtaz> got it
[05:25:41] <slaughter> I'm vegan, there's no wait
[05:25:53] <slaughter> Oh read that backwards. Still, my joke was good
[05:25:53] <rawtaz> LOL
[05:25:59] <rawtaz> it all comes naturally i take it
[05:26:02] <rawtaz> yeah it was!
[05:30:14] <slaughter> 3x a day most days. If it wasn't for phone games I'd barely have to stop
[05:30:20] <slaughter> moving
[05:30:31] <slaughter> What a bad time for an early enter key
[05:30:49] <rawtaz> premature entering sucks :(
[05:31:05] <rawtaz> you never know when it hits and what the consequences might be
[05:34:26] <slaughter> Sometimes you can just go up and fix it
[05:34:37] <slaughter> Sometimes you're stuck in the consequences
[05:37:35] <rawtaz> eww
[05:39:01] <slaughter> Yeah it's pretty shit
[05:41:46] <rawtaz> haha
[05:41:58] <rawtaz> its almost as if it's 2 AM
