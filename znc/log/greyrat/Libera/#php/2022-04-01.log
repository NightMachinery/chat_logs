[16:51:32] <gde33> Blondie101010: I was just stripping off all .foo from file names assuming they were all .jpeg .JPEG .jpg .JPG .JpG etc
[16:51:36] <__adrian> gde33: do not compare against  2
[16:51:42] <__adrian> use  IMAGETYPE_JPEG
[16:52:07] <gde33> what could go wrong with 2?
[16:52:09] <Blondie101010> gde33:  yes, but where is the real constraint?  the tool you use to view it?
[16:52:21] <__adrian> always use constants. NEVER use the constant's value. the value is arbitrary.
[16:52:28] <gde33> oh
[16:52:47] <gde33> Blondie101010: I don't understand
[16:52:55] <gde33> Blondie101010: the images must be jpg
[16:53:04] <Blondie101010> gde33:  you seem to be giving importance to something that doesn't, especially to php
[16:53:05] <gde33> but I was just testing for images
[16:53:08] <__adrian> if someone changed the value of that constant for no/any reason, no one should care because they're using the constant and not its value. this is why constants exist.
[16:53:25] <gde33> __adrian: yeah I understand

[16:53:44] <__adrian> i also don't know what you mean by "apparently one can change .png into .jpg without issues until the file is moved"
[16:53:45] <Blondie101010> gde33:  take a .jpg, rename it to gif, and open it in your browser
[16:54:00] <gde33> Blondie101010: that normally works
[16:54:06] <Blondie101010> it will work because your browser doesn't care
[16:54:08] <__adrian> if you mean the file extension... yeah, sure? it's just the filename.
[16:54:13] <Blondie101010> and it is correct not to dare
[16:54:15] <Blondie101010> *care
[16:54:35] <gde33> I also rotate and resize the image, not sure if any of that is interested in the file extension
[16:54:36] <__adrian> do you mean you're trying to actually trying to covert the file?
[16:55:09] <Blondie101010> gde33:  the type matters for the operations you run on it or how you import it
[16:55:18] <Blondie101010> not the extension itself at all
[16:55:51] <gde33> If the situation is hectic enough the significant other was substituting product photos with screen shots (png). This should never happen and it produced these erronious images.

[16:56:26] <__adrian> .___·
[16:56:59] <__adrian> there's nothing wrong with pngs
[16:57:00] <gde33> how exactly it happens I don't know but at least I know where the input should have been rejected
[16:58:31] <gde33> true, it's just one way for me to know the image is not an actual photo
[16:59:22] <gde33> I want to force the height of images to avoid the page from jumping up and down while loading
[16:59:36] <gde33> the png is unlikely to have the right aspect ratio
[17:00:28] <__adrian> why don't you check the aspect ratio, then?
[17:01:07] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[17:01:55] <gde33> seems overkill
[17:02:25] <__adrian> assuming that the aspect ratio is wrong because it's a png seems foolish
[17:03:13] <Blondie101010> it is...  the real aspect will depend on the frame/window size
[17:03:52] <__adrian> aside from all this, if you're worried about how an image is displayed, you should be looking at css
[17:03:56] <gde33> true, I just want the bare minimum of checks. I was checking exif_imagetype just to get rid of potentially terrible uploads. Got rid of original file names too (by your advice)
[17:04:32] <Blondie101010> that is all sane then
[17:04:56] <gde33> I like to keep css minimal too.
[17:04:56] <Blondie101010> do you accept uploads from other people or just your immediate family?
[17:05:05] <Blondie101010> not related or useful
[17:05:06] <gde33> only the significant other
[17:05:21] <Blondie101010> then just give them a good password
[17:05:22] <gde33> still someone could gain access in theory :/
[17:05:57] <__adrian> this still sounds like something that ought to be solved with ssh or ftp
[17:06:35] <Blondie101010> sounds like a human problem for that :)
[17:06:41] <gde33> about that, I should be making an inventory and supplier administration but I'm worried about security. Currently if someone gains access to the backend there is little information to be had and all changes can be rolled back easily.
[17:07:08] <Blondie101010> inventory?  is this for some kind of online shop?
[17:07:18] <gde33> should I create a different website for it entirely?
[17:07:23] <__adrian> the idea that "i have nothing worth stealing" in counterproductive
[17:07:24] <gde33> Blondie101010: yeah

[17:09:02] <__adrian> because it's compute resources that the attacker can use, but doesn't own. e.g., most compromised shared hosting accounts aren't used to steal whatever the site selling, but to send spam.
[17:09:06] <gde33> is it really? I prefer not to have sensitive things on the site (within reason ofc)
[17:09:38] <Blondie101010> that's fine, and a good thing if it can be avoided
[17:10:02] <Blondie101010> but the authentication system needs to be robust
[17:11:12] <Blondie101010> if someone gets access to the account that uploads, your whole site is compromised whatever their intention is
[17:11:12] <__adrian> ^
[17:12:28] <Blondie101010> gde33:  my point here is that you're spending too much time on the trivial part if uploads are not open to the public
[17:14:13] <gde33> there are no user accounts atm
[17:15:19] <Blondie101010> how do you restrict the uploads?
[17:15:31] <gde33> oh there is an admin login ofc
[17:15:44] <Blondie101010> so that's what I'm talking about
[17:15:55] <gde33> the customers just have to buy something often enough or the cookie expires
[17:16:19] <Blondie101010> why do they need to keep any active session?
[17:16:21] <__adrian> ._·
[17:16:49] <gde33> just to avoid having to type in the name, address, phone, email etc
[17:17:22] <Blondie101010> so log in when it's time to complete the purchase, and that's it, no?
[17:18:26] <gde33> Normally it works like that. I just send them off to the payment processor directly after they type their credentials
[17:20:08] <Blondie101010> ok so what's the problem with the session timing out?

[23:03:05] <relipse> does anyone understand this? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/61qDpFjK/
[23:04:27] <Albright> Looks like code trying to get data from a database query dynamically.
[23:04:39] <Albright> Line 9 will fail as $row is unset there.
[23:04:55] <Albright> I think maybe $row is supposed to be $meta?
[23:05:29] <relipse> yeah i'm trying to figure it out
[23:05:46] <Albright> And line 2 is kinda redundant since line 1 will already cause an error if $stmt1 is unset.

[23:06:08] <relipse> yeah i get that it's not the best example of code, but what was the programmer doing
[23:07:09] <Albright> The while() clause is messing with me
[23:07:27] <Albright> I guess this will *only* return the value of the "sort_column" field returned from the query?
[23:07:41] <relipse> yes albright
[23:07:43] <Albright> From the last row returned by the query, if it returns mroe than one
[23:07:52] <Albright> Well, it doesn't "return" per se
[23:07:59] <relipse> its like he is trying to fetch associative array but doing some crazy way of doing it
[23:08:09] <relipse> he explodes it beneath
