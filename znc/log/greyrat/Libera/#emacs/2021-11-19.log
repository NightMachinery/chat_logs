[01:01:42] <bpalmer> rpav: incidentally, chrome supports tab-to-search for sites supporting opensearch out of the box (firefox also supports it but I'm not positive how much needs configured)

[01:02:35] <bpalmer> if you visit a site https://www.example.com , and it specifies opensearch details in its metadata, then typing example.com in the omnibox and then hitting TAB will let you search using that site as the search engine
[01:02:54] <twb> and the %% is unmodified file?

[01:04:12] <bpalmer> this is a bit hidden for, e.g., wikipedia, because you have to type en.wikipedia.org (or whatever your locale is), as that's where search metadata is presented.

[01:09:21] <twb> who even has bookmarks anymore
[01:09:49] <bpalmer> I'm actively trying to get into bookmarking again.
[01:09:54] <TRS-80> one of my first moves away from GUI was actually putting my "bookmarks" into simple HTML files
[01:10:02] <smoking_gnu4> I always use bookmarks
[01:10:02] <bpalmer> who wants to have a hundred tabs open?
[01:10:15] <TRS-80> then I found TiddlyWiki, then Orgmode and it was all over
[01:10:27] <bpalmer> TRS-80: classically, that's how firefox stored its bookmarks
[01:11:01] <bpalmer> It's not an ideal file format (you can't just append new things to it)
[01:11:06] <TRS-80> bpalmer: Is your use case to pause research and return later, or add to some longer term knowledge store?
[01:11:18] <bpalmer> Yes and/or yes.
[01:11:24] <TRS-80> Well Orgmode makes up for all that, and adds a lot of notes, tables, etc. to boot?
[01:11:25] <bpalmer> mostly the former.
[01:11:51] <TRS-80> Export Tabs URLs add-on might be what you are looking for
[01:11:51] <bpalmer> Even when I try using org, i don't have good integration between my browser and org, but there is always the clipboard, I suppose.
[01:12:14] <TRS-80> You can even set up a custom format (I have mine set up to export the links as Org links)
[01:13:13] <bpalmer> but that's all a bit of a tangent, because keyword bookmarks are what you use for sites that support searching, not the random articles to be read.

[18:30:27] <MiraCat> There's like 9001 lisp and scheme dialects. Do I really need to know all of them to know scheme and lisp?
[18:30:32] <acdw> no

[18:30:53] <acdw> they are just sad
[18:32:01] <edgar-rft> MiraCat: Common Lisp (clisp, sbcl) is stable since 1994, but Scheme implementations are varying wildly.

[18:33:01] <MiraCat> Thank you edgar-rft. If I get the hang of elisp, I can transfer to scheme easily because emacs devs are planning on replacing elisp with guile.
[18:33:24] <acdw> that's news to me --- when did that happen?
[18:33:30] <VincentV`> "emacs devs are planning on replacing elisp with guile" source pls
[18:33:35] <MiraCat> Well it's what I heard
[18:33:46] <grym> MiraCat: i very much doubt it's realistic. 
[18:33:52] <acdw> afaik guilemacs was a short-lived attempt but is now defunct
[18:34:04] <acdw> elisp is closer to cl afaik
[18:34:09] <grym> https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuileEmacs  yeah it's sputtered out 
[18:34:29] <acdw> too bad tbh
[18:35:00] <grym> commits from 2016 don't inspire much confidence in progress
[18:35:16] <edgar-rft> MiraCat: we hear that since minimum 10 years but nobody has ever seen a working Guile-Emacs so far :-)
[18:35:47] <MiraCat> So learning guile or any form of scheme is completely optional, but learning common lisp would be beneficial for elisp?

[18:36:33] <MiraCat> Ok. So common lisp is also completely optional?
[18:36:50] <edgar-rft> MiraCat: Elisp is a rather poor Lisp implementation, it's just barebones enough to configure a text editor (no joke).
[18:36:52] <grym> i'm an idiot, but my understanding is that elisp's focus is specialised enough for its job that it's a fairly distinct thing 
[18:36:54] <rpav> technically though you may not come across more interesting CL constructs now-available-in-EL
[18:37:16] <grym> like, i very much doubt that common-lisp knows what a buffer is 
[18:37:24] <rpav> e.g. CL has loop, cl-defun / cl-defmacro and some others which are more powerful forms
[18:37:36] <rpav> bah, elisp is pretty good now
[18:38:04] <acdw> grym speaks the true
[18:38:04] <rpav> there's not really anything i miss from CL .. maybe there's no CLOS, but CLOS is a bit overrated
[18:38:16] <acdw> rpav: isn't there,,, EIEIO?
[18:38:17] <grym> i wonder how valid the 'framework' analogy is here; where you have, e.g., "Django people"  and if you hand them "numpy code" they'll look at you like you have two heads, and vice versa, despite both things being ostensibly the same language
[18:38:34] <edgar-rft> elisp is good enough for me to write most of my throwaway-code in it, what other people use e.g. Python for
[18:38:36] <TRS-80> I keep reading how bad ELisp is, yet I remain blissfully ignorant!  :)

[23:52:41] <rpav> yeah just that basically
[23:53:08] <rpav> at least i think.. except if the assertion is true, then inherently suspect 🤔
[23:53:16] <Catie> Agree. Today would be good for a nap

[23:53:48] * rpav is still of the opinion somewhere between 1:30-3:30 should officially be daily naptime
[23:54:07] <grym> but, fika time!
[23:54:37] <rpav> is that DST related, or something to do with swatch internet time
[23:54:42] <grym> (he says, having an early and weirdly dales-centric teatime)
[23:54:54] <grym> neither; fika is scandi coffee break 
[23:54:58] <rpav> ah
[23:55:12] <rpav> for me, coffee break is whenever my coffee cup is empty 
[23:55:48] <rpav> but i did get an ok insulated 20oz mug to reduce this occurrence
[23:55:54] <TRS-80> rpav: it is in some parts of Europ (Spain I guess?)
[23:56:10] <grym> rpav: you need ... a bluetooth enabled smart coffee cup!!

[23:56:31] <rpav> grym: i think i'm morally opposed to smart technology
[23:56:56] <grym> but! you could pair your cup with your phone and set your temperature, customize presets, receive notifications and more! 
[23:58:06] <rpav> or at least an advocate of what i think of as "autotech" .. i.e. things that do the thing they're intended to, and/or do what you say, without requiring online signup, a nonlocal network connection (unless inherently necessary), or trying to anticipate and/or apply popular assumptions to your decision
[23:58:52] <rpav> grym: ok, that might be ok, except generally i think i keep my coffee cup closer than my phone ;) ... which gives me the best idea i've had all day!
