[00:35:27] <T`aZ> i guess madam did not take off either
[00:42:48] <Renderwww> "Microsoft is testing ads in the Windows 11 File Explorer" imagine not hopping on the year of the linux desktop bandwagon now
[00:44:57] <T`aZ> i keep saying this since win7
[00:45:22] <T`aZ> totally unaceptable practice, but still, people do not change anyway
[00:46:20] <T`aZ> im thinking that all the tech people have already made the switch. only gamers are missing. the rest of the plebs will keep digesting microsoftcrap forever
[00:46:33] <T`aZ> or google, whichever will survive this descent to the bottom
[00:47:02] <Renderwww> but my spredsheets!
[00:47:18] <T`aZ> plebs !
[00:47:26] <T`aZ> isnt everything online now anyway ?
[00:47:54] <T`aZ> it's even more easy ot make the switch, you have less 'i need to run $APP absolutely'
[00:48:06] <T`aZ> not so true 20y ago
[00:48:23] <T`aZ> (unfortunately, i hate cloud crap, obviously)
[00:53:06] <MaNI> strangely people would rather use a crap version of linux inside WSL on their ad riddled windows desktop than install linux directly
[00:56:27] <rpav> maybe if linux came with candy crush
[00:58:30] <T`aZ> linux needs a stable api *distro*/repo thingy, the kernel can run 20yo binaries, glibc can run 20yo binaries. Distros to not ship old binaries and you are stuck downloading random binaries of old rpm from the internet, this is nto acceptable
[00:58:49] <T`aZ> second point missing is to be able to target *older* glibc from the one you are using
[00:59:17] <T`aZ> which is not suported. Fix those, and enjoy $$$$, erm I mean users, boatload more users
[01:00:48] <rpav> yeah, that's what the users are complaining about.. their _glibc_ is _too new_
[01:00:53] <T`aZ> 3rd critical point missing in the ecosystem : a moder, non retarded, fast , graphical display, and no, wayland is not such a thing
[01:01:19] <rpav> you walk down the road and some dude is like "man i run windows and hate it, but if linux shipped with an old ass version of glibc, you bet i'd use it! and so would all my friends!"
[01:01:41] <T`aZ> i bet you never compiled a single binary and tried to run it on another machine
[01:02:16] <rpav> i bet you're not familiar with .so symbol versioning and shipping binaries with their dependencies, or appimage
[01:02:45] <T`aZ> lol, the new retarded way of static linking everything, or containerising everything, which is even worse
[01:03:10] <T`aZ> you cannot ask to compile for glibc N-1 if you have glibc N
[01:03:46] <T`aZ> versioning is solving the issue where you want to run old binaries on newer system, not the other way around

[10:09:00] <MaNI> did the channel manage to solve linux packaging yet?
[10:09:21] <jotham> nope
[10:10:30] <Renderwww> T`aZ suggest we solve it by statically linking everything into our binaries and then shove those binaries into flatpaks
[10:10:35] <Renderwww> or just go full cloud
[10:11:11] <Renderwww> my suggestion would be to target windows 7 and then run everything through wine
[10:30:56] <Carbonflux> maybe their should be an ideal version of linux in the cloud, then we all just reference it, the criteria for how upstream pushes are reviewed would be related to the quality of gifts you send to linus, he will only evaluate them when he is drunk.
[10:32:21] <Carbonflux> er, never mind, its that way already.
[10:41:53] <MaNI> target windows xp and run everything through wine
[10:47:11] <Carbonflux> i miss windows xp

[17:32:43] <Renderwww> c++, c#, test coverage wouldn't really help much. It would only tell me where I broke the old stuff, not where I need to change code for the new stuff

[17:37:19] <rpav> er what
[17:37:27] <Faux> Ew.
[17:38:31] <rpav> if you change the semantics of F, and you call it from X, Y, and Z, and you have coverage of X, Y, and Z, it would tell you that they broke and you need to change them

[17:39:24] <rpav> but really, "semantic change of F" is a less good way to do it than making F1 in parallel to F, and updating all things-that-use-F to F1 
[17:39:43] <rpav> testing won't help there, but mostly because they don't break along the way
[17:45:24] <Renderwww> I'm actually glad there aren't any tests because I would have 10x the work if I also had to adjust all the fucking tests
[17:47:23] <rpav> yeah, imagine being able to tell if your code worked like you expected ;)
[17:53:23] <jotham> sounds unrealistic rpav
