[00:45:07] <LeoNerd> Ahyes, I have some of those little modules. I was going to make an ultrasonic wind sensor out of them but it turns out the AVRs are nowhere near fast enough to get enough resolution from it
[00:45:55] <zgu> i have one fewer than i did a couple weeks ago when i plugged one into the wrong header and shot 12V onto one of its TTL pins
[00:46:18] <LeoNerd> oops
[00:48:10] <LeoNerd> Hmm so it turns out I have two of these panels. I should test daisychaining them
[00:49:15] <zgu> still needs some filtering on the rangefinder signal so it doesn't glitch back and forth between signal aspects as much, and i don't know how well the temperature compensation will actually work
[00:50:44] <zgu> you don't have enough for a full length times square ticker?
[00:52:41] <LeoNerd> I've got two of these 8x32 panels.. so I can do 8x64, or 16x32
[00:53:24] <LeoNerd> I also have a nice 16x32 HUB75 panel but I'm not sure as if Perl will be fast enough to drive that

[01:14:18] <mst> next step: trick LeoNerd into trying and then getting angry so he optimises perl until it is fast enough to drive that
[01:16:41] <LeoNerd> hrmm.. it's also about reliability. HUB75 panels are multiplexed in software, not hardware. Because they do something like 16:1 multiplexing, it means you have to drive the LEDs really bright in their on time, because they spend a lot of their time off. If the software that drives the multiplexing ever crashes or even just pauses, you're sometimes stuck driving a row of LEDs too hot, and burn them
[01:17:05] <LeoNerd> You remember those warnings about bad X11 modelines being able to actually blow up CRTs?
[01:17:10] <LeoNerd> Kinda similar ;)

[01:57:01] <simcop2387> used to have an old arcade system converted to mame with a few custom modelines for different screen layouts

[02:19:42] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: no need already did
[02:19:49] <simcop2387> unless you push new changes of course
[02:20:08] <LeoNerd> Oh, just those three commits; most recent  1561f6f (HEAD -> leonerd-fixes, leonerd/leonerd-fixes) Error message if attempt to open spidev fails
[02:20:27] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: should be part of 0.00007
[02:20:55] <simcop2387> once i build the testing board for it and get it to test spi, i2c and gpio even in a basic fashion i'll probably try throwing the version number way up
[02:21:06] <LeoNerd> Mmm
[02:21:13] <simcop2387> i'll also get it setup so that you guys can trigger tests from it
[02:21:33] <LeoNerd> So a thing I discovered today... If you run the GPIO adapter it tries to claim all the GPIO lines by exporting them, and that steals them from spidev so you can't use that as well
[02:22:16] <simcop2387> interesting, didn't know the kernel would do exclusions like that.  that'd need to be fixed up so that it figures out what all the gpios are but doesn't export them until you tell it you need them
[02:22:52] <LeoNerd> At least, I think it did. I was having multiple troubles even making the /dev/spidev0.0 exist, so... it's possible that was unrelated
[02:22:54] <LeoNerd> I'll retest a bit more

[03:34:28] <zgu> it is quite clunky if you're doing anything other than quick shell-based testing
[03:35:06] <zgu> and the gpio[sg]et tools that come with gpiod are easier for that even
[03:36:02] <zgu> there there's all the raspberry pi-specific examples based on poking /dev/mem...
[03:36:16] <simcop2387> yea the whole idea of a global state like that that can't be tracked is so terrible too.  the new interface should let you do better for monitoring for input changes with interrupts and such too
[03:36:54] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: just pushed a new update, minor, just adds you to the author list
[03:36:55] <zgu> hopefully. i haven't looked at how it handles interrupts yet
[03:37:31] <simcop2387> from what i've seen, it *should* cause an epoll/io_uring/etc. event to happen so you can grab the new state
[03:37:50] <simcop2387> sort of like happens with the current sysfs interface, except not over 2000000000 file handles
[03:38:11] <zgu> yeah i assume you can poll on the device node then respond to it somehow
[03:38:34] <simcop2387> ok guess i should get dressed and go out.  need to grab some over the counter meds that i'm out on and i kinda want a soda.

But from my use currently of the SPI stuff, the spidev param is specified once on the adapter -itself-
[15:59:07] <LeoNerd> Which means I can't easily do two SPI chips, say using the CE0 and CE1 pins, on the same adapter. (such as if I'm going to do two rows of MAX7219 panels)

[21:08:04] <xenu> also why the hell that module needs to touch /sbin
[21:08:05] <ilmari> but that breaks --install_base, used by things like local::lib

[21:17:44] <Delemas>  /usr/sbin is a normal place for a server but I believe there was an argument 10 years ago about using sbin and the author gave up getting a config option for sbin. It is what it is. Bringing up that argument again is counterproductive. The people using it need a non-broken module for non-root builds. Thanks re: missing use and {} I will try modifying it that way.

[21:21:12] <Grinnz> the point is that most non-root builds will do so via local::lib
[21:21:54] <Grinnz> which does it the way it does so that it has a base for lib, bin, and man
[21:22:05] <ilmari> I gues using "$Config{installprefix}/sbin" is slightly less broken than hard-coding "/usr/sbin"

[21:31:56] <Delemas> Unfortunately that still didn't work. Clearly variable is empty when installer gets it: ERROR: Can't create '/sbin'  Do not have write permissions on '/sbin'
[21:32:10] <haarg> remove the install_path section
[21:32:30] <ilmari> Delemas: did you `use Config`?
[21:32:35] <Delemas> Yes
[21:32:40] <haarg> and after the sub process_sbin_files, add: sub install_destination { my ($self, $type) = @_; $type = 'bin' if $type eq 'sbin'; return $self->SUPER::install_destination($type); }
[21:35:26] <Delemas> @haarg thanks I'll try that.
[21:40:14] <Delemas> Well that makes the install not error out on non-root but puts it in /opt/perl5/perls/perl-5.32.1/bin/ instead of /opt/perl5/perls/perl-5.32.1/sbin/

[21:44:16] <ilmari> does anybody use /sbin with custom prefixes?
[21:44:46] * ilmari has only ever ever seen (/usr(/local)?)?/sbin
[21:45:10] <xenu> i mean /usr/local *is* a prefix
[21:46:31] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d4be51.access.ecotel.net)
[21:46:38] <Delemas> The module uses /usr/sbin/spfd w/ perl installs w/ root and I'm trying for $CONFIG{installprefix}/sbin/spfd on non root.
[21:46:49] <xenu> also i believe homebrew on m1 has /opt/homebrew/sbin

[21:47:40] <xenu> and macpors use /opt/local/sbin

[21:47:44] <Delemas> I built 5.32.1 with perlbrew if that matters.
[21:48:08] <Delemas> It's an older Ubuntu box I can't upgrade at the moment.
[21:48:46] <simcop2387> ilmari: i've seen stuff under /opt/<thingy>/sbin before but that's the closest i've seen
[21:50:26] <ilmari> Delemas: use Config; install_path => { sbin => "$Config{installprefix}/sbin") } seems to work here

[21:51:01] <Delemas> we've managed to get /opt/<thingy>/bin here so we are close. It is the sbin part that is eluding us atm.
[21:51:11] <ilmari> except my installprefix isn't writable, because I use `perlbrew lib` (i.e. local::lib) for everything
[21:52:12] <ilmari> Delemas: the only thing I did was add `use Config;` at the start, and change the `install_path` argument to `{ sbin => "$Config{installprefix}/sbin" }`
[21:52:15] <Delemas> ilmari, uhm you have an extra ) there no?
[21:52:24] <ilmari> Delemas: yeah, sorry
[21:52:31] <ilmari> it doesn't fix the local::lib case, but at least it fixes the custom prefix case
[21:53:24] <Delemas> I realize it isn't perfection but something functional that allows some automation is better than manual hackery.
[21:54:59] <Delemas> ilmari, hmm I wonder why I'm getting a different result.... Are you on Perl 5.32.1 or 5.34.0?
[21:55:45] <Delemas> Let me try re-implementing closer together.
[21:56:21] <ilmari> Delemas: 5.34.0. but it works on 5.8.9 too
[21:57:00] <ilmari> oh, that Build.PL doesn't use strict or warnings
[21:57:15] <ilmari> so if you typo `$Config` it won't tell you
[21:57:24] <Delemas> It is an ancient module.
[21:57:59] <Delemas> I'll add warnings to see if it gives me a hint.
[21:58:33] <ilmari> warnings won't help, but strict would, except that barfs on all the unquoted module names
[21:58:52] <Delemas> Use of uninitialized value $CONFIG{"installprefix"} in concatenation (.) or string at Build.PL line 44. <- Obviously something isn't right...
[21:59:06] <ilmari> 17:37 < ilmari> also, it's `$Config{...}`, and you need to `use Config;`
[21:59:16] <ilmari> $Config, not $CONFIG
[21:59:28] <Delemas> That will do it. lol thanks
[21:59:37] <ilmari> I've only said that five times â€¦
[22:00:52] <Delemas> Sorry it's been a long day...
[22:02:22] <Delemas> It works now thank you.
