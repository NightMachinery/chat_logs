[21:55:21] <jotham> no dukwon 
[21:55:35] <jotham> nz has a high rising terminal which means we end every word slightly higher pitched
[21:56:12] <jotham> and we use vowels differently to the UK and AU but most countries do
[21:56:30] <jotham> but the a is long and the o is short
[22:02:03] <jotham> also definitely not an NZ video
[22:02:13] <jotham> think 777 phone prefix is america
[22:02:32] <Oxyd> I suppose I do rhyme them.

[22:03:16] <jotham> yeah i didn't know if that was a gag though
[22:03:20] <jotham> so looked up the other posters

[22:13:30] <jotham> a guy in highschool fucked a goat when he was drunk
[22:13:34] <jotham> that was... special
[22:13:49] <Raziel> so you witnessed it firsthand, then?
[22:14:00] <jotham> naah he opened up about it at a party
[22:14:06] <Raziel> lol
[22:14:10] <jotham> i mean he could have lied, but i don't see why he would have
[22:14:36] <jotham> at the time i was masturbating like 8 times a day
[22:14:45] <jotham> so it didn't seem that outrageous in terms of sex drive
[22:15:11] *** Quits: CaCode_ (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:15:30] <jotham> but given how homophobic our culture was back then, i don't think anything remotely resembling abnormal hetrosexual interaction was acceptable
[22:16:06] <jotham> so i figure he must have and had to acknowledge it to himself as much as to us
[22:16:17] <Raziel> well, surely it was a... female goat?
[22:16:25] <jotham> no idea
[22:16:27] <jotham> hehe
[22:16:35] <Raziel> oof
[22:19:00] <Bakunin> lol <jotham> at the time i was masturbating like 8 times a day

[22:22:42] <jotham> heh
[22:22:58] <jotham> at work we're throwing more and more iops and ram at this customer
[22:23:09] <jotham> and there seems to be no selection pressure
[22:23:16] <jotham> so the developers do dumber and dumber shit
[22:23:21] <jotham> and the customer just pays more and more
[22:23:25] <jotham> i mean it's good for us
[22:23:30] <jotham> but seems like a bad way to make software
[22:23:42] <Raziel> jotham, y'all got RAM? can I borrow some? I need to run some combinatorics
[22:24:54] <jotham> we're pretty small i think overall we have 4TB ram and 10TB of NVME
[22:25:14] <Raziel> better than what I've got :p
[22:25:23] <jotham> 400 something cores at 2.4ghz
[22:25:35] <jotham> it's just a bunch of dell gear
[22:25:55] <jotham> still seems like modern software requires endless resources because cloud
[22:26:29] <jotham> running out of disk space seems to be the main fault customers have
[22:26:30] <Raziel> indeed. and that's dumb. people need to learn to... actually code?
[22:26:36] <jotham> but you can't really tell them about it
[22:26:38] <jotham> they don't care
[22:26:44] <jotham> yeah
[22:26:48] <Raziel> but in some cases, you really do need to crunch some big data
[22:26:56] <jotham> sometimes
[22:27:19] <jotham> i mean i think ORMs are the main offenders
[22:27:21] <Raziel> like in my case, I need to crunch a lot of combinatorics to precompute a map for something's outcomes, basically.
[22:27:22] <jotham> in the whole shitshow
[22:27:32] <jotham> so people don't need to crunch like they do crunch
[22:32:37] <Raziel> crunchy
[22:33:03] <jotham> i think apache parquet sounds pretty interesting
[22:33:09] <jotham> but i don't know how to suggest it at work
[22:34:07] <jotham> most of europes energy needs could be solved by morocco generating solar
[22:34:12] <jotham> er w/w
[22:35:37] <Raziel> gib nuclear pls
[22:36:03] <Juliu> Building some more modern nuclear power plants would be way better
[22:36:20] <jotham> well lets see how the cino-french project goes
[22:36:25] <jotham> finland is building one too aye
[22:36:25] <Juliu> All this eco bullshit that is just there to scam the people and get their money
[22:36:27] <jotham> almost done
[22:36:48] <Raziel> nuclear is still eco, but it also doesn't use up obscene amounts of physical space
[22:36:56] <Raziel> and it's more cost-effective even discounting the cost of the space used too v:
[22:37:02] <Juliu> This man-made global warming hoax is an even bigger hoax than the plandemic
[22:37:14] <jotham> this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taishan_Nuclear_Power_Plant
[22:37:21] <jotham> anyway finland i think is building one too
[22:37:33] <jotham> so we might be about to see a new wave of nuclear plants
[22:37:38] <Juliu> I read that the netherlands are building 11 new ones
[22:37:39] <jotham> doesn't help my country but
[22:37:50] <Raziel> jotham, it doesn't? are you in germany?
[22:37:56] <jotham> new zealand
[22:38:02] <Raziel> ah, right
[22:38:12] <jotham> can't really legitimately build a nuclear plant here because of the redundancy we'd need

[22:38:53] <jotham> my uncle works on our geothermal network

[22:39:02] <jotham> geothermal doesn't work very well
[22:39:47] <jotham> but yeah these EPR reactors sound like the way forward
[22:39:54] <jotham> germany might have to just ignore its green party
[22:40:00] <jotham> or educate them
[22:40:24] <Raziel> indeed
[22:41:03] <Juliu> If you need redundance, simply build 3 instead of 1 nuclear power plant
[22:41:40] <jotham> yeah that's cost prohibitive and the earthquake problem still exists
[22:41:44] <jotham> we do have uranium though
[22:41:56] <Raziel> does anyone actually have that much power redundancy?
[22:41:57] <Juliu> Most German people seem hopelessly lost in their fantasy thoughts on how things work in the real world
[22:41:57] <jotham> lots of models have been made on nuclear here
[22:42:07] <Raziel> I feel like most countries' redudancy is just "import it lol"
[22:42:11] <jotham> i see Juliu is a conspiracy theorist
[22:42:24] <jotham> yeah that seems common with the EU grid Raziel 
[22:42:35] <jotham> australia and nz can't really do that
[22:42:45] <Raziel> yeah, being an island kinda sucks
[22:43:15] <jotham> australia just stole all the natural gas from the islands north of it

[22:43:30] <Juliu> jotham, so you are a conspiracy deniar?
[22:43:34] <jotham> wearing a mask has one simple purpose Juliu 
[22:43:36] <Raziel> lol
[22:43:39] <jotham> to stop you spitting everywhere
[22:43:40] <jotham> that's all
[22:43:47] <jotham> it's to protect other dumb cunts, not you
[22:43:58] <jotham> humans spit a lot
[22:44:10] <Juliu> jotham, yes, wearing a mask = less fresh oxygen and more carbon dioxide rebreathing = getting dumber
[22:44:20] <jotham> yawn
[22:44:25] <Raziel> masks are cool. I hope this whole thing is gonna make it more socially acceptable to wear a mask. :p
[22:44:34] <jotham> we're way too far into the global pandemic to hear dumb shit like this
[22:44:45] <Juliu> I bet there is a measurable dumbing of the young generation that is now wearing the mask all the time in a few years
[22:45:02] <Raziel> that would be a very easy bet to win for your opponents
[22:45:04] <Juliu> jotham, there has not been a single pandemic in over 50 years
[22:45:15] <jotham> mate take it elsewhere
[22:45:21] <jotham> you're a crackpot
[22:45:28] <Juliu> jotham, stop believing every bullshit the media tells you
[22:45:36] <Juliu> I'm a scientists and you are just naive
[22:45:42] <jotham> haha
[22:45:47] <jotham> okay you win
[22:46:12] <Juliu> jotham, you must be German. Are you? You are as brainwashed as the typical German
[22:46:14] <jotham> why not talk about nuclear power instead of what you must absolutely tell everyone about
[22:46:33] <jotham> i answered that above
[22:46:47] <Juliu> New Zeeland is close enough to Germany for my taste
[22:47:02] <jotham> why are we talking about this instead of nuclear reactors
[22:47:08] <jotham> are you paid to do this
[22:47:22] <Juliu> I'm so sick of brainwashed people
[22:47:55] <jotham> so why not talk about nuclear power
[22:48:05] <jotham> you seem to have the malfunction here
[22:49:00] <jotham> i suspect Juliu may be correct in using scientists plural rather than singular
[22:49:13] <jotham> he is a body of many ideas and identities
[22:49:22] <Raziel> lol
[22:50:44] <jotham> i was reading about this today, seems pretty interesting https://scitechdaily.com/mit-superconducting-magnet-breaks-records-in-major-advance-toward-fusion-energy/
[22:50:52] <jotham> yada yada same joke, fusion is 30 years away
[22:50:57] <jotham> vr has been like that my whole life too
[22:51:08] <Raziel> at least they're still going at it
[22:51:15] <jotham> yeah it's great
[22:51:42] <jotham> i've been following ITER pretty regularly and it blows my mind how immense the project is and it's only the test version
[22:51:49] <jotham> the real one will have to be fuck loads bigger
[22:52:17] <jotham> yet they have japan, korea, america, germany, england, spain, france etc all using their best engineering work
[22:52:24] <jotham> and its taken 30 years
[22:53:24] *** Quits: dostoyevsky2 (~sck@user/dostoyevsky2) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:53:31] <jotham> one of the MIT guys was saying lots of the stuff they are using was invented in the 70s and 80s but no one saw it being practically useful until now
[22:53:47] <jotham> so it's as much breakthrough as digging into old physics and math that no one thought had a use
[22:54:31] <jotham> still when like 75% of our greenhouse emissions are energy we need it now more than ever
[22:54:55] *** Joins: dostoyevsky2 (~sck@user/dostoyevsky2)
[22:55:14] <Juliu> How can there still be people who pretend that there was a pandemic in the last 50 years? Unbelievable
[22:55:42] <jotham> are you paid to do this Juliu 
[22:55:45] <jotham> no one cares
[22:56:00] <Juliu> Are you paid to believe stupid shit? If not, why do you do it?
[22:56:13] <jotham> explain something stupid that i believe
[22:56:40] <Raziel> I don't see any logical train of through in which the pandemic or virus does not exist
[22:56:40] <jotham> also why don't you want to talk about fusion or fission reactors
[22:57:14] <jotham> maybe Juliu is a green activist
[22:57:22] <jotham> and is trying to derail the future of engineering
[22:57:38] <jotham> lots of environmentalists are antivax weirdos
[22:57:51] <T`aZ> i think he's just a non green moron
[22:58:54] <Juliu> jotham, I am not for destroying the earth. But I am also not for falling for the brainwashing of man-made global warming
[22:59:35] <Juliu> I think we should have more CO2 in our athmosphere, not less. But most people don't get that
[22:59:39] <jotham> who is doing this brainwashing
[22:59:52] <jotham> how is it globally and universally organised
[23:00:34] <Juliu> And the thought that a warmer climate would make more species go extinct is so rediculously stupid, when you concider that warmer climate always meant different species in earth's past
[23:00:37] <jotham> could your brain just be faulty? what's your sample size? 1?
[23:00:59] <Juliu> *more different species, more diverse, more life
[23:01:17] <Bakunin> this is fucking hilarious
[23:01:17] <Bakunin> https://twitter.com/Firr/status/1456324664628846599
[23:01:38] <Juliu> Either you are trolling or a paid shill, or dumb as fuck, if you still haven't noticed that a worldwide PsyOp is going on
[23:01:54] <jotham> who is doing this brainwashing
[23:01:56] <jotham> how is it globally and universally organised
[23:01:59] <Bakunin> wait
[23:02:03] <Bakunin> we got a live one?
[23:02:06] <Bakunin> hellow Juliu
[23:02:13] <Juliu> Hi
[23:02:16] <Bakunin> What country to you claim to be from?
[23:02:26] <Bakunin> Quebecois?
[23:02:26] <Juliu> Me?
[23:02:29] <jotham> seems like a deranged yank to me
[23:02:43] <jotham> their country appears to be cooked
[23:03:02] <Juliu> Seriously, less people died and got sick in 2020, and there are still people claiming we had a pandemic? *facepalm*
[23:03:12] <Raziel> I do think the panic and fearmongering about warming is a bit exaggerated, as well as being dumped onto the common folk when most of the contribution to climate change is NOT the common folk, it's the corporations and govs
[23:03:32] <Raziel> but it's still not a great thing if it is to happen, especially past certain points
[23:03:42] <jotham> that's the main focus of this cop26, corporations trying to organize together, but that just leads to greenwashing
[23:03:55] <Juliu> Actually a warmer climate is very great for life in general
[23:04:10] <T`aZ> this only gets better it seems
[23:04:13] <Raziel> it can be great for *some* life, and sucky for some other life
[23:04:27] <T`aZ> enjoy our new local idiot
[23:04:29] <Raziel> very sucky for some parts of humanity
[23:04:30] <Juliu> If you are one of those green supporters, you should support a warmer climate
[23:04:49] <jotham> did you hire him off fiverr, T`aZ 
[23:05:24] <Juliu> The only problem is: No matter if you are for or against a different climate, you can't influence it anyway
[23:05:51] <Bakunin> Juliu fascinating belief systems you have
[23:06:00] <Bakunin> are they from Facebook, or are you in a cult?
[23:06:22] <Juliu> Bakunin, it's call science. You can join
[23:06:37] <jotham> this european idea to convert coal power plants into batteries was pretty interesting
[23:06:53] <Juliu> No, as far as I heard, facebook and all the other tech fascists ban people who speak the truth
[23:07:06] <Bakunin> Juliu so you are into science?
[23:07:14] <Juliu> Bakunin, I am a scientist
[23:07:17] <Bakunin> is this where you climate opinions come from?
[23:07:33] <Bakunin> okay, which papers or pubs can you share to support your view?
[23:07:50] <Juliu> Bakunin, climate science is not science. At least not in the eyes of a real scientist
[23:07:56] <jotham> https://www.powerengineeringint.com/smart-grid-td/energy-storage/turning-coal-plants-into-storage-assets/
[23:08:03] <Bakunin> but you're claiming special knowledge
[23:08:17] <Bakunin> thats not quite science :)
[23:08:21] <Juliu> Bakunin, it's not special. You guys are just brainwashed and uninformed
[23:08:30] <Bakunin> so wheres the information?
[23:08:43] <Bakunin> am desperate to read it
[23:08:51] <jotham> who is doing the brainwashing Juliu 
[23:08:57] <jotham> and who is globally organizing it
[23:09:00] <Juliu> Bakunin, you just have to do your homework and inform yourself and think critically
[23:09:19] <jotham> Juliu is either an american or a massive fan of america with these talking points
[23:09:39] <Bakunin> which homework can I possibly do?
[23:09:43] <Juliu> Big tech and high finance are doing the brainwashing. They pretty much bought all mainstream media and most governments
[23:09:48] <Juliu> Pretty obvious
[23:10:10] <jotham> even in china?
[23:10:16] <Bakunin> okay, so where's the independent publications which agree with you?
[23:10:36] <Bakunin> throw me a bone here, I'm an autodidact
[23:10:47] <Juliu> People who ask such dumb question after 2 years of the most obvious scam in human history are completely hopeless
[23:10:55] <jotham> so communism and high finance and silicon valley (???) have got together and hatched a plan
[23:11:02] <jotham> you know that sounds very unreasonable, right
[23:11:38] <Juliu> Do me a favor and go take your "vaccines". At least it increases the risk that you die
[23:11:39] <Bakunin> jotham dont miss that tweet i posted tho, king shit
[23:11:39] <jotham> the city of london, beijing, and california walk into a bar
[23:13:14] <jotham> city of london says to the bartender, maybe we should release less nitrous oxide, methane, and co2 into the air we breath
[23:13:26] <jotham> it doesn't make much sense Juliu 
[23:13:28] <Bakunin> Juliu dont confuse me with jotham.  I was asking about climate change
[23:13:53] <jotham> yeah sorry i was interrupting
[23:14:36] <Juliu> Indeed, talking to victims of a brainwashing is pointless
[23:14:49] <Juliu> Bakunin, what climate change?
[23:15:06] <jotham> i think these contrarians just do it for attention
[23:17:46] <Juliu> jotham, you are completely brainwashed and ignore obvious facts
[23:17:58] <jotham> what's the financial incentive in making us switch to solar
[23:18:23] <Juliu> How can you believe in a disease caused by a virus that has no scientific proof of existence, without realizing that this is like believing in Santa Claus?
[23:18:27] <jotham> you keep saying i'm brainwashed, but i don't see your explanation
[23:18:35] <jotham> why are you going on about covid-19
[23:18:48] <Raziel> big oof energy
[23:19:04] <jotham> are you saying china, which still uses a lot of coal, is building experimental nuclear plants, is focused on brainwashing us about wind turbines and solar panels?
[23:19:24] <Juliu> jotham, because Covid-19 does not exist
[23:19:31] <Bakunin> Juliu you know, anthropogenic atmospheric warming
[23:19:32] <jotham> why are you fixated on covid
[23:19:41] <Bakunin> You said you were into science
[23:19:48] <Bakunin> where is it?
[23:20:12] <Juliu> Bakunin, we had the coldest winter in the antarctic since 61 years, I think
[23:20:33] <jotham> my country has sequenced every case of covid we've had pretty much, i guess they were sequencing something that doesn't exist, even though it's established medical science and part of pandemic response
[23:20:39] <jotham> you are not making a lot of sense Juliu 
[23:20:43] <Bakunin> Juliu that's not science
[23:20:58] <Bakunin> I mean stuff that scientists create and disseminate
[23:21:00] <Juliu> jotham, you can NOT sequence covid since covid is not even a virus, even if it was real. Moron
[23:21:11] <jotham> why are you calling me names
[23:21:20] <jotham> and why are you fixated on covid
[23:21:28] <jotham> alternative energy generation is a way more fun topic
[23:21:29] <Bakunin> hm, he's a partial match for CESS
[23:21:31] <Juliu> Bakunin, measuring temperature is not science if it doesn't support the bullshit the media is saying? I see
[23:21:43] <Bakunin> detecting some carbon flux
[23:21:47] <Juliu> jotham, why do you always say Covid as if it was a real thing?
[23:21:50] <jotham> carb is all good
[23:22:16] <Bakunin> Juliu, I'm starting to think you don't know what a list of termperatures is called.
[23:22:17] <Raziel> I guess we know why Juliu does not have a job
[23:22:30] <Raziel> imagine slipping "covid isn't real" in your "what are your hobbies?" interview question
[23:22:38] <jotham> haha
[23:22:58] <jotham> long walks on the beach and fighting the chinese silicon valley city of london cabal
[23:23:23] <Juliu> Bakunin, I'm starting to think that you don't know what climate is
[23:23:35] <Juliu> Raziel, why would I need a job?
[23:23:48] <jotham> definitely not talking about EPR reactors
[23:25:07] <Juliu> Raziel, why would I want to work for a company who believes in the existence of fake things like Covid?
[23:25:56] <Raziel> maybe they could teach you a few things about how the scientific method actually works?
[23:26:03] <Juliu> Why would I want to work for someone else at all? Other people are idiots
[23:26:39] <Juliu> I've never met anyone who wasn't an idiot so far
[23:26:49] <Raziel> I'm sure the feeling is mutual
[23:27:38] <Juliu> I am sure as well. But that doesn't mean I am not right
[23:28:01] <Juliu> If you don't feel every second of your life that you are constantly surrounded by complete idiots, then you are one of them
[23:28:34] <Bakunin> Juliu well, you clearly don't.
[23:28:34] <Bakunin> Stay in school, kids
[23:28:43] <Raziel> by extension of empiricism, at some point, if enough people say the opposite thing of you, you'd have to actually look into whether your assumptions are true or not
[23:29:52] <Juliu> Bakunin, get a degree
[23:30:19] <jotham> i have an art degree, so i doubt that holds up that well Juliu 
[23:30:21] <Juliu> Raziel, if enough people say the opposite, it just proves that there are enough idiots. Simple
[23:30:33] <Juliu> jotham, I was talking about real degrees
[23:30:34] <Raziel> not if they're right
[23:30:35] <Oxyd> This is like an enhanced version of Carbonflux. I like it.
[23:30:49] <Juliu> Raziel, if they were right they would not have a different opinion. Simple
[23:30:54] <jotham> carb at least brings interesting weird ideas
[23:31:02] <jotham> this guy is just a bot made out of american media
[23:31:14] <Juliu> jotham, I'm not even American
[23:31:15] <Raziel> opinions are not fact, opinions are not the result of scientific methods
[23:31:16] <Bakunin> it seems like it
[23:31:27] <jotham> you sure have taken their ideas to heart Juliu 
[23:31:30] <Bakunin> yeah, Canadians have these brain worms too, just not as many
[23:31:38] <Juliu> Facts? You guys believe in made up viruses and talk about facts?
[23:31:49] <Bakunin> They elected Rob Ford, then when he heart attacked out, they elected his dumber, meaner brother
[23:31:50] <jotham> well we were talking about power generation
[23:31:54] <Juliu> jotham, I take ideas to my heard that make sense
[23:32:09] <Juliu> jotham, power can't be generated
[23:32:10] <jotham> your broken english supports the idea you aren't just a pissed up yank
[23:32:16] <Bakunin> Juliu has the tired routine of never answering a question
[23:32:19] <Bakunin> just spewing
[23:32:24] <jotham> it's tedious 
[23:32:35] <Juliu> Bakunin, why would I do your research for you? Am I your secretary?
[23:32:42] <Bakunin> see
[23:32:46] <Bakunin> he only asks questions
[23:32:47] <Juliu> See
[23:32:58] <Bakunin> the routine is tired, bro
[23:32:59] <jotham> i assume he's paid to do this
[23:33:02] <jotham> for some weird reason
[23:33:04] <Juliu> An idiot like everyone else, always expecting me to do their job
[23:33:19] <Bakunin> \I wonder if he will get less engagement points from his handler if we stop saying his nick
[23:33:24] <Bakunin> and just talk about him
[23:33:34] <Juliu> jotham, no one pays me to tell the truth ... because no one profits from the truth
[23:33:46] <Raziel> well, per empiricism, until you get a fancy-ass microscope and several blood samples from both "presumably" infected people and non-infected, and analyze them, you can't actually KNOW if the virus exists or doesn't exist
[23:33:47] <jotham> maybe a google summer of code project that was abandoned and has gone off the rails with infinite gce credits
[23:34:03] <Bakunin> you got paid to join #c++-social
[23:34:10] <Raziel> both assuming it exists and assuming it doesn't are based on other people's information and experiences, not your own
[23:35:00] <jotham> in before 'why should i do your job for you, i don't need a microscope'
[23:35:16] <Juliu> Raziel, you can win 1.5 million USD for delivering any scientific proof that Sars-Cov-2 exists. Doesn't even have to be your own proof. So far no one won. Probably for a reason. Even the Canadian and the Spanish departments of health had to admit officially that they have no proof and don't know any laboratory that has a sample of Sars-Cov-2
[23:35:35] <Raziel> citation needed
[23:35:50] <Juliu> I bet you are better than them and will be able to proof the existence of a virus that was already confessed to be made up
[23:36:16] <Bakunin> he's British :D
[23:36:16] <jotham> can you please provide a link to an article about this Juliu 
[23:36:18] <Bakunin> it gets better

[23:36:28] <Raziel> well, for one, virology is not my specialty, so I'm definitely not the best suited to that...
[23:36:47] <Raziel> and, for two, it would simply be incorrect to believe anything you say until I can witness it myself through my own senses.
[23:36:48] <Raziel> :p
[23:36:50] <Juliu> jotham, I am also not your secretary. Will you morons ever understand that? Do you god damn homework yourself. You already had 2 years to do s
[23:36:52] <Juliu> so
[23:36:54] <Bakunin> he doesn't know that MI5 won't protect him from us
[23:37:16] <Bakunin> "GOD DAMN MORONS 2 YEARS HOMEWORK!!!"  got it
[23:37:42] <Juliu> If you still don't get that Sars-Cov-2 is made up and was already confessed by the CDC, then you slept for 2 years
[23:37:45] <Bakunin> Juliu have you watched the movie about it?
[23:38:09] <jotham> maybe he watched a facebook video on it
[23:38:11] <Juliu> Bakunin, a movie about a virus that does not exist? No, I haven't seen that
[23:38:19] <jessicara> made up by the cdc, yet detected all over the world
[23:38:22] <jessicara> lol
[23:38:25] <jotham> T`aZ: is this guy just a pissed up version of you?
[23:38:27] <Bakunin> Now he's lying about the CDC
[23:38:27] <Juliu> jotham, facebook bans people for saying the truth
[23:38:37] <jotham> Juliu: they absolutely don't
[23:38:53] <jotham> Juliu: my uncle relentlessly spams things about aliens and has never been banned or cautioned
[23:39:08] <Raziel> technically facebook can ban anyone for whatever the fuck they want
[23:39:11] <Raziel> it's in their tos. v:
[23:39:14] <Juliu> Bakunin, I am not lying. The CDC officially admitted that they had no sample of Sars-Cov-2 (of course not, since it does not exist) for developing their PCR tests. So the tests measure random bullshit
[23:39:19] <Bakunin> srs Q:  What are the benefits and drawbacks of giving your real name and address to ICANN
[23:39:33] <Bakunin> No they didnt
[23:39:38] <jotham> in NZ it's a line of business thing Bakunin 
[23:39:57] <Bakunin> im being asked to update my contact info on my domains
[23:40:05] <Juliu> jotham, so far the governments and the people in power are not really interested in aliens, so you can spam bullshit about that. But the moment you talk the truth about gender, made up pandemics, fake climate change, or other truths, you get banned

[23:40:34] <jotham> Juliu: more chat about nuclear plants plz
[23:40:49] <Juliu> jotham, not my fault the truth isn't more exciting for you
[23:40:53] <jotham> your grab bag of right wing american talking points isn't very clever
[23:41:19] <jotham> it just makes actual conservative people look dumb
[23:41:30] <Juliu> jotham, I'm not that interested in nuclear plants. There isn't that many lies about them. My opinion is that we should build more, of the newest kind
[23:41:30] <jotham> you're basically mental graffiti
[23:42:16] <Juliu> You are basically an anti-scientific moron who has been brainwashed for 2 years and now believes every bullshit, no matter how little sense it makes
[23:42:27] <jotham> explain what i was brainwashed about
[23:42:33] <Bakunin> "So, what do you call this act?"  ... "THE CATALYSTS!"  *hand jazz*
[23:42:33] <Juliu> I did already
[23:42:35] <jotham> and who brainwashed me
[23:42:42] <Juliu> I also explained that
[23:42:47] <Juliu> You are very slow
[23:42:51] <Juliu> No wonder you are here
[23:42:52] <Juliu> :D
[23:42:54] <jotham> then i think you can wrap up your monologue, right
[23:42:55] <Bakunin> stop lying
[23:43:04] <Juliu> I never lie ... at least not here
[23:43:24] <Juliu> jotham, it's not a monologue if I answer to your question, you moron
[23:43:29] <Bakunin> then kill yourself
[23:43:35] <Bakunin> Come on, you must have an easy way to do it.  Use your firearm, komrade
[23:43:42] <Juliu> Bakunin, can I kill you idiots instead? That would help more
[23:43:48] <Bakunin> yes
[23:43:50] <Bakunin> come here
[23:43:52] <Oxyd> I like the psychology of all of this. He's convinced himself that everyone who disagrees with him has been brainwashed and not worth taking seriously. How do you even reach through that?
[23:43:56] <Juliu> I don't have a firearm, sadly
[23:44:06] <Bakunin> Oxyd, it's beyond his psyche, as he is a script
[23:44:22] <Bakunin> Then jump off a building, like all good Russians
[23:44:28] <Juliu> Oxyd, that is just experience. If people disagree with me, they are very likely to be incorrect
[23:44:30] <Bakunin> you know you want to die.
[23:44:36] <jotham> if he was a brit he'd have a luty
[23:44:37] <Raziel> Oxyd, honestly, it'd probably take either a paradigm-shift level revelation, or some really hard drugs
[23:44:39] <jotham> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Luty#Firearms_design
[23:44:52] <Bakunin> yeah he's russian
[23:44:54] <Oxyd> You think drugs could help?
[23:44:55] <Juliu> Bakunin, I don't want to die. I want idiots to die
[23:45:05] <Bakunin> No, you want to die.
[23:45:16] <Bakunin> That's why you are here.
[23:45:18] <Juliu> Oxyd, I don't think that drugs could make the other people more intelligent, sadly
[23:45:20] <Bakunin> You came here to tell us you want to die.
[23:45:21] <Bakunin> You said so yourself.
[23:45:25] <Bakunin> I can help you commit suicide.
[23:45:31] <Bakunin> You're going to need someone like me.
[23:45:35] <jotham> and to go on about covid
[23:45:36] <Juliu> Bakunin, I never said anything about dying. Stop lying
[23:45:39] <jotham> even though no one gives a shit
[23:45:41] <Bakunin> Yes you did
[23:45:50] <Juliu> jotham, I can't go on about Covid since it doesn't exist
[23:45:55] <jotham> you have
[23:45:57] <jotham> for like an hour
[23:45:57] <Juliu> Bakunin, liar
[23:45:58] <Bakunin> And I already proved that you came here asking for help killing yourself.
[23:46:08] <Bakunin> Do you have an apotheke nearby
[23:46:09] <Raziel> Oxyd, not on their own. but some could potentially temporarily nudge the mind out of it's extreme locked state
[23:46:11] <jessicara> even if it didn't exist, it's very easy to go on about something which doesn't exist
[23:46:16] <Juliu> jotham, dude, you believe in a non-existent virus since 2 years
[23:46:16] <Bakunin> Take cyanide
[23:46:26] <Oxyd> Raziel: What sort of drug are you thinking?
[23:46:32] <Bakunin> sodium hypochlorite is useful as well
[23:46:39] <jotham> probably just as easy as a good dose of magic mushrooms
[23:46:46] <Raziel> Oxyd, probably psychedelics
[23:46:54] <Juliu> Oxyd, I suggest you don't take any drugs and instead try thinking the classical way. It works, if you really want
[23:47:13] <Oxyd> I really don't see how psychedelics could help. If anything, he needs the exact opposite of that.
[23:47:16] <Bakunin> No drugs?  Then we are back to you jumping off of a roof, Juliu
[23:47:27] <Juliu> Bakunin, drugs are for losers
[23:47:28] <Bakunin> You must choose a tall building, such as 9 or 10 stories
[23:47:39] <Bakunin> Tall buildings are for winners, like you
[23:47:49] <Bakunin> are there any nearby, within walking distace?
[23:47:53] <Bakunin> Are you in one right now?
[23:48:03] <Juliu> Bakunin, the whole idea of tall buildings is dumb as fuck
[23:48:10] <jotham> Oxyd: in my experience mushrooms have helped me look at my assumptions in a clearer light
[23:48:18] <Bakunin> then you being in one is also dumb as whatever "fuck" is
[23:48:25] <jotham> also i find them quite intense and not enjoyable
[23:48:32] <Juliu> Bakunin, I am not in a tall building
[23:48:42] <Bakunin> unfortunately your inferior intellect is posing barriers to helping you commit suicide, Juliu
[23:48:48] <Raziel> Oxyd, because psychedelics don't necessarily cause or amplify psychosis, they can instead trigger introspection and the breaking of mental locks
[23:48:51] <Bakunin> thn go to one
[23:49:02] <Juliu> It was that clear that you guys have experience with drugs. Typical for people in chats, aka losers
[23:49:04] <Bakunin> it is ideal to not survive your suicide attempt, Juliu.
[23:49:21] <Oxyd> Raziel: I suppose introspection might work.
[23:49:25] <Bakunin> We know you are a loser who hates himself, Juliu.
[23:49:33] <Bakunin> That's why we are trying to help you.
[23:49:40] <Bakunin> You came here to be helped.
[23:49:43] <Juliu> Bakunin, since when does anyone need a tall building for suicide? And btw, suicide attempts are for losers. Winners do a suicide and succeed
[23:49:58] <Bakunin> Now thats the spirit.
[23:50:09] <Juliu> Bakunin, I just hate idiots ... for a reason
[23:50:09] <Bakunin> Do you have a tub in your apartment?
[23:50:20] *** Quits: froggy (~froggy@2.235.241.212) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:50:30] <Oxyd> Maybe we could load psychedelics onto airplanes and spray them over built-up areas, simultaneously curing conspiracy theorists and proving them right.
[23:50:31] *** Joins: froggy (~froggy@2.235.241.212)
[23:50:34] <Juliu> Bakunin, suicide won't make you get a brain, so it's a dumb idea
[23:50:34] <Bakunin> One must be very committed to succeed at suicide in a shower.
[23:50:35] <jotham> my friends husband ducttaped a black trash sack around his head
[23:50:38] <jotham> and passed out on the couch
[23:50:41] <jotham> and died
[23:50:46] <jotham> seems like a pretty low effort way to go
[23:50:49] <Juliu> jotham, interesting method
[23:50:53] <Bakunin> Juliu, what would help you get a brain
[23:51:10] <Juliu> Bakunin, I already have one ... and degrees ... unlike you
[23:51:21] <Raziel> also, at this point this has really become a rather unpleasant shit-slinging competition
[23:51:23] <Bakunin> Wrong answer, loser.  You were supposed to say cadaver theft.
[23:51:26] <Raziel> perhaps we should de-escalate
[23:51:27] <Raziel> :p
[23:51:37] <Juliu> Raziel, then I suggest you shut up
[23:51:50] <jotham> i don't get how these nut jobs turn everything into covid trutherism
[23:51:54] <jotham> it's so tedious
[23:52:01] <Bakunin> You dropped out of secondary school, Juliu.  You have zero degrees.
[23:52:01] <jotham> has made the last year online a hassle quite often
[23:52:08] <Juliu> jotham, you are the nut job. You believe in non-existent things
[23:52:11] <Raziel> suggestion has been noted, archived and sent to the correct processing center
[23:52:26] <jotham> you win Juliu 
[23:52:28] <Juliu> Bakunin, I bet that is how I got my PhD, right
[23:52:49] <Bakunin> Our records show you were out by Grade 8
[23:52:52] <Juliu> jotham, you just avoid the topic so you don't have to admit to yourself what an idiot you have been
[23:53:02] <Bakunin> there is no phd
[23:53:09] <Juliu> Bakunin, your roleplay is boring
[23:53:16] <Bakunin> you are a doctor of being a lizard online
[23:53:26] <Bakunin> did you come here to be ignored
[23:53:33] <Bakunin> Mister Special Knowledge?
[23:53:34] <Juliu> jotham, don't worry, millions of people have been deceived. But it's time to wake up!
[23:53:49] <Oxyd> In Russia they probably give out PhDs for being friends with the right people anyway.
[23:53:50] <Bakunin> you came to lecture to losers to wake up
[23:53:59] <jotham> i think i know who Juliu is, and if it is him, there is no fixing this
[23:54:02] <Juliu> Bakunin, I have never been a lizard, sorry. I'm not a politician and also not Mark Zuckerberg
[23:54:05] <jotham> this is how he gets attention
[23:54:21] <Juliu> jotham, I am me. I only have this nickname
[23:54:27] <Bakunin> oh i know him
[23:54:31] <Bakunin> https://www.cameo.com/v/YPPWRR2Fm
[23:54:39] <Bakunin> ^ this was recorded for Juliu
[23:54:44] <Raziel> Oxyd, unfortunately for the psychedelics to have any decent chance of having good effects, you'd also need a psychologist or other specialist to, at the very least, "nudge" you in the right direction
[23:54:45] <Juliu> Bakunin, why would I go to lectures?
[23:55:28] <Juliu> Raziel, what a bullshit. You could simply do trial and error
[23:55:29] <Bakunin> MahJong has some weird legal battle with him
[23:55:52] <Juliu> Why are people so seriously dumb all the time? I just don't get it
[23:56:05] <Oxyd> Raziel: Sounds impractical then, given how many people like that there are.
[23:56:15] <Juliu> What is wrong with them? They already had been this dumb when I was in school, and it just got worse and worse the older I got
[23:57:08] <Juliu> It should be legal to hit dumb people, so I could hit everyone all the time and yell at them to stop being this dumb
[23:57:26] <Raziel> Oxyd, it's very impractical and very touchy. just pumping people full of antidepressants and hoping for the best is much cheaper and much more consistent
[23:58:19] <Juliu> Oxyd, I seriously don't think that any drug would help you be more intelligent. Just do it the normal way ... by thinking
[23:58:49] <Bakunin> he seems to believe he's not compromised
[23:59:04] <jotham> glad i woke up early for this tour de force
[23:59:24] <jotham> we're having the largest solar storm for years at the moment
[23:59:29] <jotham> and it's been overcast every night
[23:59:33] <jotham> it's very annoying
[23:59:40] <jotham> should have had some good aurora action
[23:59:48] <jotham> people on the south island have been getting amazing video of it
