[01:43:28] <Hunterkll> In July 2019, Microsoft announced that Kaizala Pro's capabilities would be gradually adopted in Microsoft Teams over the next 12 to 18 months, and that Teams would eventually replace Kaizala as a single collaboration solution

[01:45:14] <pcspkr> microsoft is going google
[01:45:17] <pcspkr> 10 different chat apps
[01:45:19] <Hunterkll> because it filled an apparently large need at the time in the regions that it was required
[01:45:25] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: because it's not primarily a chat app?
[01:45:30] <Hunterkll> and it's merging into teams
[01:45:54] <Hunterkll> S4B is kill, roll into teams, plain jane skype is some bastard child microsoft regrets and just flounders on its own 
[01:46:05] <Hunterkll> but can't kill because of international usage and the userbaes still being so hard

[01:47:00] <Hunterkll> It seems Kaizala fit a unique fill in how indian organizations/companies/governments do business that teams wasn't ready for and was optimized for shit connectivity etc

[04:09:20] <Hunterkll> Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a mandatory part of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 and newer versions. We do not recommend that you disable IPv6 or its components. If you do, some Windows components may not function.
[04:09:20] <Hunterkll> We recommend using Prefer IPv4 over IPv6 in prefix policies instead of disabling IPV6.
[04:09:24] <A-KO> and I'm like "I told you this 6 months ago"

[04:10:16] <A-KO> nah
[04:10:20] <Hunterkll> bloody: why do you think MS has been releasing server software which externally talks IPv4 only 100% just fine, but still need IPv6 on the server OS itself to actually function?

[04:14:03] <Hunterkll> but yes, i've had software on linux in the early 2000s - network daemons, even fucking infrared communication shit 
[04:14:06] <Hunterkll> that needed IPv6 enabled
[04:14:09] <signofzeta> Comcast had to switch to IPv6, because they used the 10/8 for managing modems and filled it up.

[04:14:55] <Hunterkll> You LITERALLY just encountered one
[04:15:27] <signofzeta> Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Exchange, and Windows Store malfunction when IPv6 is explicitly disabled -- though, besides Exchange, patches were issued to fix it with the proviso that Microsoft does not and will never support situations where IPv6 is disabled.
[04:15:45] <Hunterkll> yea we're talking about non-windows
[04:15:51] <Hunterkll> like AIX, Solaris and Linux
[04:16:03] <Hunterkll> AIX is the earliest example I can think of (1999) demanding IPv6 configuration 
[04:16:18] <A-KO> I actually told my infosec team that I cannot turn off ipv6 on Exchange
[04:16:19] <signofzeta> Well, I use SSH over IPv6 because port forwarding is a pain.  Though, I changed jobs and no longer need remote access.
[04:16:22] <Hunterkll> windows didn't even really HAVE IPv6 at that point 
[04:16:41] <A-KO> 2000 eventually had a v6 stack I thought
[04:16:44] <Hunterkll> yes
[04:16:46] <A-KO> not sure which SP it was
[04:16:50] <Hunterkll> an experimental, oiptional to install one
[04:16:53] <A-KO> yeah
[04:17:07] <A-KO> probably wouldn't work on today's v6 networks tbh
[04:17:08] <A-KO> lol
[04:17:12] <Hunterkll> it does/would
[04:17:13] <A-KO> maybe at a basic level with static addressing
[04:17:15] <signofzeta> Windows XP had an IPv6 stack, optionally and requiring manual install.  It also didn't have DHCPv6 or support rDNSS.
[04:17:26] <A-KO> rdnss didn't come until mid windows 10
[04:17:27] <Hunterkll> A-KO: yea, even my 1999 AIX release talks to the internet just fine 
[04:17:29] <A-KO> like 1703 or something
[04:17:30] <signofzeta> WinXP's IPv6 did SLAAC and nothing else.
[04:17:51] <dragonfleas> Hunterkll do some infrared interfaces use ipv6 translation or something
[04:18:07] <dragonfleas> i can't imagine why an infrared device would need that enabled lol
[04:18:11] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: no the dude was abusing ipv6 loopback shit 
[04:18:15] <Hunterkll> on the host side
[04:18:16] <Hunterkll> it was stupid
[04:18:16] <dragonfleas> ah ok
[04:18:25] <dragonfleas> weirdchamp
[04:18:25] <Hunterkll> but it was also the easiest way to achive what he wanted to do 
[04:18:31] <Hunterkll> instead of doing weird sockety shit
[04:19:11] <A-KO> I set up the ps5 ; I should install the cpu this weekend
[04:19:30] <Hunterkll> heh
[04:19:38] <Hunterkll> wonder if the 2k ipv6 stack was ever updated
[04:19:45] <signofzeta> Correct me if I'm wrong, but since Windows Vista (NT6), doesn't IPv4 just use the IPv6 stack?  That is, doesn't legacy IP like 192.0.2.1 get mapped to ::ffff:192.0.2.1 internally?
[04:19:45] <Hunterkll> i know when i poked at it back in the day it only supported SP1 
[04:19:47] <Hunterkll> SP2 broke it
[04:19:52] <Hunterkll> ....... no
[04:20:10] <Hunterkll> you can completely kill the ipv6 part of the stack with no malfunction in a lot of parts 
[04:20:31] <signofzeta> Fair enough. I thought I heard Microsoft mapped it.
[04:20:45] <signofzeta> Thanks for correcting me.
[04:21:12] <Hunterkll> there's a lot of tech that does/requires that 
[04:21:21] <Hunterkll> but that's translation tech etc
[04:21:33] <signofzeta> it's easier to maintain a single IP stack rather than two
[04:21:54] <signofzeta> though I know Microsoft still has two separate checkboxes for IP versions.
[04:22:04] <Hunterkll> er
[04:22:11] <bloody> dragonfleas: have you got an infernal cape?
[04:22:20] <Hunterkll> every stack i can think of has v4 and v6 handling as separate .....
[04:22:21] <Hunterkll> like
[04:22:25] <dragonfleas> no, infero makes me rage every time
[04:22:30] <Hunterkll> i can't think of one that doesn't
[04:22:30] <dragonfleas> inferno*
[04:22:42] <Hunterkll> routing tables, firewall, etc 
[04:22:44] <Hunterkll> are all separate
[04:22:48] <bloody> well, if u need one I know a guy ;)
[04:22:58] <bloody> (not me)
[04:23:11] <signofzeta> well, maybe Microsoft talked big and then doubled back.
[04:23:17] <Hunterkll> you can make them visually appear together, but that just greatly increases code complexity, unreliability, and WTFs per minute by developers if you try to actually logically hanlde it all together
[04:23:24] <Hunterkll> or maybe you're just mis-remembering
[04:23:34] <signofzeta> I could be.
[04:23:40] <signofzeta> I mean, I found this:  https://www.arin.net/blog/2019/04/03/microsoft-works-toward-ipv6-only-single-stack-network/
[04:23:46] <signofzeta> But that isn't what I was thinking of.
[04:23:51] <bloody> though I have done the inferno a couple of times myself
[04:23:57] <bloody> not enjoyable though
[04:23:57] <signofzeta> I know LinkedIn's internal network is v6-only.
[04:24:07] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: yea, that's just their network not running dual stack
[04:24:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:24:54] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: I could have sworn they turned Windows IPv4 into a service on the IPv6 stack, but Windows Vista came out fifteen years ago, and my memory barely goes back fifteen minutes.,
[04:26:17] <dragonfleas> bloody i can hire a venny to do it for me for like 50 cents
[04:26:17] <Hunterkll> you might be thinking of the "dual ip" stack model
[04:26:23] <bloody> lolol
[04:26:26] <bloody> nice
[04:26:28] <Hunterkll> where they split it into 'transport' 'network' and 'framing'
[04:26:33] <bloody> did you max with services?
[04:26:33] <Hunterkll> 'transport' being udp/tcp etc 
[04:26:39] <Hunterkll> 'network' being ipv4 or ipv6 handling 
[04:26:46] <Hunterkll> and framing obviously being like, 802.3/802.11 etc
[04:26:47] <bloody> like, did you ever have any of your accounts serviced
[04:26:50] <Hunterkll> so it's 'one stack'
[04:26:58] <Hunterkll> but you still have separate modules handling ipv4 or ipv6
[04:27:25] <signofzeta> for what it's worth, my home network is natively dual-stack.  My Wii and PS3 use IPv4 exclusively.  All other devices use their choice.  That's about it.  Not the end of the world, but ready for the "next" world.
[04:27:29] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: basically, the 'transport' and 'framing' layers merged so ipv4 and ipv6 share those in common 
[04:28:48] <Hunterkll> https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/content/images/chap6_9780735673106/elementLinks/httpatomoreillycomsourcemspimages1769504.png
[04:28:50] <Hunterkll> ^ like that
[04:29:05] <Hunterkll> so say, ipv4 or ipv6 at the 'network layer' both use the same 'transport' layer code
[04:29:24] <signofzeta> Thanks, Hunterkll!  I needed a serious refresher.
[04:29:50] <Hunterkll> but v4/v6 at the 'network layer' still have their independent code paths
[04:30:04] <Hunterkll> now the ::ffff: stuff is great for network translation tech, getting out over 464XLAT, etc 
[04:30:26] <Hunterkll> and can help if you're only using IPv6 addressing functions but still need to send to an IPv4 address via V4 
[04:30:31] <Hunterkll> among many other crazy scenarios
[04:30:38] <signofzeta> I'm sure Microsoft will move to an IPv6-only model, with IPv4 via a compatibility layer.  Not in Win11, or Win12, or even Win15.  But, whenever Comcast and Spectrum and the other ISP's do their part -- so probably never, or decades out.
[04:30:45] <Hunterkll> but 192.168.1.69 is still 192.168.1.69 to the internal thing 
[04:30:48] <Hunterkll> i highly doubt it
[04:30:55] <Hunterkll> that just adds more complexity 
[04:31:01] <Hunterkll> and latency 
[04:31:04] *** Quits: djhankb (~djhankb@208.113.164.68) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:31:31] <signofzeta> Yeah, I hear Android uses that on 4G/LTE/5G networks.  I'm an iPhone user.  I only have an IPv6 address on LTE but can somehow access IPv4-only hosts.
[04:31:35] *** Joins: djhankb (~djhankb@208.113.164.68)
[04:31:40] <Hunterkll> yes
[04:31:46] <Hunterkll> if you're on T-Mobile, you're using 464XLAT
[04:31:46] <signofzeta> (But on my Wi-Fi, I have dual-stack.  Talking cell here.)
[04:32:00] <Hunterkll> 95% of t-mobile's OTA IP traffic is IPv6 
[04:32:24] <Hunterkll> they only maintain IPv4 APNs/addressing and IPv4 CGN for devices that can't speak IPv6 and/or 464XLAT
[04:32:51] <Hunterkll> 464XLAT gives you a "v4" interface locally, wraps it in V6, then at the network edge, the  service provider unwraps it and lets it out onto the internet
[04:32:57] <signofzeta> You know what's weird?  I had a Verizon Wireless customer ages ago.  Their phones were IPv6-only before my T-Mobile ones were.  I was shocked!  Then I was shocked again when they ordered a VZW hotspot that was somehow IPv4-only.
[04:33:11] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: that's not exactly true
[04:33:18] <signofzeta> Oh?
[04:33:20] <Hunterkll> T-Mobile was rock hard the pioneer of IPv6 and IPv6 tech in cellular space
[04:33:41] <Hunterkll> I was in their internal beta program for IPv6 enablement back when only the Nokia N900 could even use it
[04:33:53] <sd> 09<H​aise> nice
[04:33:54] <signofzeta> Well, their Verizon Wireless 4G/LTE hotspot was IPv4 only.
[04:33:54] <Hunterkll> like literally the only device on the market that could
[04:34:02] <Hunterkll> IPv4 only to *your* devices
[04:34:09] <Hunterkll> probably V6 on the network side 
[04:34:14] <signofzeta> 464XLAT aside, why not offer native addressing on the WAN interface?  My LAN interface was ready.
[04:34:34] <Hunterkll> it probably was
[04:34:40] <sd> 09<H​aise> signofzeta: my ISP is CGNAT on their LTE lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[04:34:43] <Hunterkll> or, it was an ancient device on V4 legacy support 
[04:34:48] <signofzeta> And they left Comcast (a mobile office) which offered IPv6 on the LAN side.
[04:35:02] <signofzeta> It could have been a legacy device.  It was purchase new in 2018.
[04:35:05] <Hunterkll> i'm pretty sure we're mixing shit up
[04:35:07] <Hunterkll> either way
[04:35:15] <Hunterkll> because none of this s making sense
[04:35:23] <signofzeta> What were we talking about?

[13:13:10] <sd> 11<H​otmess> meh reddit, isp blocking broken link from person posting it
[13:13:10] <jokoon> I meant reddit, not teams
[13:13:28] <jokoon> what do you mean?
[13:14:15] <jokoon> the video is correct though
[13:14:27] <jokoon> the video ID is correct*
[13:16:53] <jokoon> https://preview.redd.it/b03794mff7s71.gif?format=mp4 that link requires a secret it seems
[13:17:10] <jokoon> weird
[13:17:24] <jokoon> I just wants to link to reddit from the video ID, doesn't seems possible
[13:27:24] <jokoon> reddit also has very high resolution gifs
[13:27:41] <jokoon> and I meant GIF as in format
[13:27:48] <jokoon> found one that is 30MB+
