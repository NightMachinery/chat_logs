[00:01:50] <PMunch> Hmm, that might be an issue
[00:02:19] <sarnold> superdad: hrm. I wonder if the first thing the cloud images do is try to resize the first drive..
[00:02:31] <superdad> @PMunch. Ya, it kind of depends on what type of filesystem I think

[00:03:53] <alkisg> PMunch: is the filesystem ext4? Do you want to resize and then reboot for it to take effect, or to take effect immediately?
[00:04:09] <PMunch> The filesystem is ext4
[00:04:11] <superdad> @PMunch, if you do "fdisk /dev/sda"  and then "p" what output do you get
[00:04:34] <PMunch> Well, now I've created a second partition on the rest of the device

[00:07:08] *** Joins: ghostcube (~ghostcube@user/ghostcube)
[00:07:31] <superdad> So I think what you want to do, is fdisk /dev/sda,  and then do "d" to delete both of those partitions
[00:07:48] <PMunch> TBH I think I'll just copy /home to the new partition, then rename it to /home_old, set up fstab to point to the new /home and reboot
[00:08:10] <superdad> Then do "n" to create a new primary partition, and have it start at 2048, and end (as large as it says which should be the full 2TB).
[00:08:21] <superdad> Do "t" to set it to type "83".
[00:08:25] <PMunch> Yeah I started on that, got two warnings: The size of this disk is 2.1 TiB (2317134856192 bytes). DOS partition table format cannot be used on drives for volumes larger than 2199023255040 bytes for 512-byte sectors. Use GUID partition table format (GPT).

[03:04:14] <ghostnik11> is it possible to just install the version of linux i want on my internal 32gb and then see if grub recognizes the other location of root for the OS on my internal micro sd card. because that boot is saved in a separate location on my internal hard drive. basically i would only erase my ubuntu partition

[03:33:07] <leftyfb> Ignorant: if you don't care about borking everything, you could try, one partition at a time, booting a live cd/usb, mounting the root and said partition (var to start) to temporary mount points and rsync'ing the partition into root. ie: sudo rsync -av /path/to/var-mount/ /path/to/root-mount/var/. Then edit /etc/fstab in the root mount and comment out mounting var. Then reboot

[05:46:02] <ghostnik11> guiverc: okay. yeah i feel like i probably could still install and just back up my grub folders and then if i can't get in to my other partition. look at the backed up files and then input the correct information to make my other partitions accessible
[05:48:09] <guiverc> the MBR (sector 0 of drive) is really just a point to the location on partition where later stages of grub are; ie. the /boot/grub/ folder on the OS system drive.. `grub-install` will put the MBR in place (grub stage 0)
[05:49:47] <ghostnik11> guiverc: okay. well i want to try it. if anything i will learn from it and figure out a way to get back into my other partition.

[18:13:57] <lotuspsychje> welcome sudorm
[18:14:09] <sudorm> lotuspsychje, hi
[18:15:00] <sudorm> I'd like to create a emaillater@mydomain.com that will store messages until 9am the next day, and if a mail client queries it via POP3, it displays "no mail"
[18:15:44] <sudorm> i.e. if I send a mail now to emaillater@mydomain.com, then, when I check new mails with Thunberbird, it will display "0 new mail". This new mail will appear in POP3 only tomorrow at 9am
[18:15:49] <sudorm> Any idea? :)
[18:16:16] <leftyfb> sudorm: don't use POP, use IMAP
[18:16:32] <leftyfb> sudorm: btw, your question is completely unrelated to ubuntu
[18:16:55] <sudorm> leftyfb, eventually I'd like Gmail to import from this POP3. Gmail supports IMAP for itself, but not for foreign address imports.
[18:17:02] <sudorm> leftyfb, I'd like to do it inside my Ubuntu server
[18:17:29] *** Joins: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP)
[18:17:34] <leftyfb> sudorm: this is a client issue (gmail is a terrible client for external email), not a server issue
[18:18:00] <leftyfb> sudorm: tell thunderbird and any other client to talk to your ubuntu email server via IMAP, not POP
[18:18:39] <TJ-> sudorm: sounds like a job for procmail and a timer (procmail to deliver those emails to a directory/mbox outside the normal location, and a timer to trigger a script to put those emails into the visible location
[18:18:40] <sudorm> leftyfb, I need to do it with POP3, but anyway this is not the problem.
[18:19:02] <sudorm> The problem is how to do the "waiting" logic? i.e. each new mail that arrives will only be seen as new mail the next day at 9am?
[18:19:08] <TJ-> sudorm: it /is/ a server issue, not a client
[18:19:30] <sudorm> TJ-, yes
[18:20:11] <sudorm> TJ-, i'd like to avoid receiving emails 50 times per day, which is very distractive

[23:34:06] <BinarySavior> is it hardware failure?
[23:34:26] <BinarySavior> i doubt it, i could boot into windows and test it
[23:34:28] <iogue> BinarySavior: Very strange... it is the same system I have here and I have the same nvida card and the intel graphics card is almost the same (at list is the same chipset, I think): HD Graphics 630
