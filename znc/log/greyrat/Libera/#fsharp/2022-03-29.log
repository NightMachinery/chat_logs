[14:32:23] <xeno> I still think I prefer the original "A monad is a functor in the category of endofunctions", but I guess that can turn pretty weird 
[14:33:14] <MatthiasVance> haha yeah
[14:34:13] <xeno> like, I've always though of a monoid +,N like if + is the functor - but then I saw an example where + was the category, and each integer in N was a functor, plus that N was the category - so that if you had the value 4, then 3 was a functor that transformed 4 into 7 , while 4 was another functor that transformed 4 into 8 
[14:34:29] <xeno> I suck at category theory, really need to study it some more
