[16:21:26] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> Hello spacemac-ers, I wrote a little code that marks some files in my projects as readonly, to avoid editing compilation results by mistake. The problem is that when I open some of these buffers almost any action seems to be prevented, even actions that don't want to change the file. For example I can't `SPC p f` to open another file in the project or even `SPC b b` to change buffer. The only possibility is 
[16:21:26] <FromGitter> ... to `SPC b p`until finding a not readonly file and then do the action.
[16:22:17] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> Is there a central place where I can define which actions are allowed on readonly files and which not?
[17:38:54] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @hariseldon78 I think making a buffer read-only normally should not really change the available actions. What is the `major-mode` in such buffer? And the `evil-state`?
[17:40:54] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> sorry I explained badly: the actions are available, but they error out
[17:41:09] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> major mode is typescript
[17:42:42] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> evil state I don't know because even pressing `:` to evaluate something givis the error: `evil-ex: Buffer is read-only: #<buffer  *Minibuf-1*>`
[17:44:54] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> this is the code I run for marking readonly:```** open build files readonly ‚èé  ‚èé #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp ‚èé  ‚èé (defun open-readonly () ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=623736dec435002500fdb613]
[17:47:48] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> could it be that it is making readonly also the minibuffer ?

[18:49:52] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> what is the evil-state
[18:55:16] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> C-h describe variable is one way
[18:55:30] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> another is to figure that out via your cursor color
