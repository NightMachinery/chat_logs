[03:49:00] <MootPoot> its really going at it
[03:49:12] <MootPoot> all 24 threads are near maxed out at 85% average
[03:49:23] <JesseDesu> what is hashing images
[03:49:32] <isekaijin> A program that MootPoot is running.
[03:49:34] <JesseDesu> hash browns
[03:49:38] <JesseDesu> potatoes
[03:49:47] <JesseDesu> what does the program do
[03:49:52] <isekaijin> Hash images.
[03:49:54] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: doing math on jpegs - to make a special unique code
[03:49:57] <MootPoot> for each image
[03:50:03] <MootPoot> then you compare the codes
[03:50:04] <JesseDesu> like  a password?
[03:50:07] <isekaijin> Not exactly.
[03:50:15] <JesseDesu> what for
[03:50:15] <MootPoot> if codes match - you have a duplicate image
[03:50:28] <JesseDesu> sounds like tinyeye
[03:50:29] <isekaijin> It computes a value called a ‚Äúhash‚Äù that is unlikely to be duplicate for two distinct images.
[03:50:30] *** Joins: Enyo (~Enyo@cpe-74-69-51-92.rochester.res.rr.com)
[03:50:45] <MootPoot> well, extremely unlikely
[03:50:46] <isekaijin> So, if two images have distinct hashes, they are guaranteed to be distinct.
[03:50:56] <isekaijin> And if two images have the same hash, it is very likely that they are the same image.
[03:50:56] <MootPoot> although I also have the resize mode on so its also cheecking for resized images
[03:51:12] <JesseDesu> what if they crop 1 row of pixels
[03:51:19] <MootPoot> then it wont match
[03:51:21] <isekaijin> rofl, distinct hashes
[03:51:24] *** Quits: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:51:30] <JesseDesu> like cropping the signature of the artist
[03:51:41] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: it dosen't have to crop a row, it can be as little as 1 pixel
[03:51:42] <isekaijin> Again, distinct hashes. (With very high likelihood.)
[03:51:48] *** Joins: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[03:51:54] <MootPoot> distinct hashes?
[03:51:54] <JesseDesu> what if they remove the meta data
[03:52:05] <MootPoot> metadata is not used here
[03:52:06] <JesseDesu> the exif shit
[03:52:07] <MootPoot> dosen't matter
[03:52:57] <isekaijin> The input for a hash function is simply a sequence of bits or bytes. You can feed the whole contents of the file to the hash function, or you can just feed the image, leaving out the metadata. It is up to you.
[03:53:55] <MootPoot> think if you just decided to count the number of letter 'a' in a book - then you compare it to other books based on the counted number
[03:54:04] <MootPoot> its not perfect,  but it gets you there
[03:54:27] <MootPoot> if two books have the same count then its pretty liekly they are a duplicate,- and you can manually delete them

[04:11:36] <JesseDesu> hmm my boss called and tried to get me to come on my off day
[04:11:43] <JesseDesu> i was like
[04:11:50] <JesseDesu> i wanna stick with the schedule
[04:11:58] <JesseDesu> and she gets upset
[04:12:03] <MootPoot> lol, you pick up the phone during off days?
[04:12:23] <JesseDesu> so i offer to come in, with an upset voice of my own
[04:12:31] <JesseDesu> then she's like, you know what, dont come in
[04:12:37] <JesseDesu> andi'm like ok ok
[04:12:52] <JesseDesu> mootpoot i am technically in management so yes
[04:12:55] <JesseDesu> i pick up the phone

[04:13:52] <MootPoot> how many hours a week?
[04:14:03] <JesseDesu> but i gotta think of it like getting paid around the clock

[04:14:11] <JesseDesu> but i work at home

[04:39:53] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: sounds like a strange way to dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M
[04:39:54] <JesseDesu> its a little bit faster

[04:40:27] <ButterNoodle> yea it does a bit more

[04:40:30] <MootPoot> resized?
[04:40:36] <ButterNoodle> kinda neeeeet
[04:40:59] <ButterNoodle> I know where all my dupes are

[04:42:35] <MootPoot> find resized/similars
[04:42:39] <ButterNoodle> theres a good start to mami
[04:42:51] <JesseDesu> lol
[04:42:53] <ButterNoodle> what about cropped out bits MootPoot 
[04:42:59] <JesseDesu> you take a shit on my brand new ipad
[04:43:08] <JesseDesu> :[
[04:43:16] <ButterNoodle> its ips95 isnt it?
[04:43:17] <MootPoot> should take care of those, but it'll present you with how similar the images are
[04:43:25] <MootPoot> you're going to have to do the final selection manually
[04:43:43] <JesseDesu> you know
[04:43:48] <JesseDesu> you could just compare 2 images
[04:43:52] <JesseDesu> by looking at them
[04:43:56] <JesseDesu> and asking yourself
[04:44:12] <MootPoot> do that 150k times and get back to me
[04:44:22] <JesseDesu> why do you have 150k images
[04:44:24] <MootPoot> within 2 hours
[04:44:31] <MootPoot> why not?
[04:44:41] <JesseDesu> someone needs to stop hoarding
[04:44:43] <MootPoot> although I have more like 400-500k
[04:44:49] <JesseDesu> and make critical decisions
[04:44:53] <MootPoot> I am
[04:44:55] <JesseDesu> before saving as
[04:44:58] <MootPoot> I'm cutting down
[04:45:39] <JesseDesu> if you have duplicates its probably because you like the image so much you need 2 or 3 copies
[04:45:44] <JesseDesu> so just keep them
[04:45:51] <MootPoot> or maybe I downloaded them once
[04:45:52] <MootPoot> forgot
[04:45:55] <MootPoot> and redownloaded
[04:46:08] <JesseDesu> stop scraping
[04:46:20] <MootPoot> no u
[04:46:25] <JesseDesu> collect junk
[04:46:43] <JesseDesu> when i download an image
[04:46:50] <JesseDesu> its because i really like it
[04:46:55] <MootPoot> same
[04:47:00] <MootPoot> I really like 500k images

[05:16:04] * ButterNoodle wants a cute lil kouhai for sex
[05:23:51] <weeb> Probably sysadmin peeves at work, but would the internet keep working if the lines themselves are severed (to be expected when humanity is eradicated)?
[05:24:05] <ButterNoodle> naa
[05:24:13] <ButterNoodle> the infrastructure would remain
[05:24:24] <ButterNoodle> the cron jobs will run
[05:24:29] <ButterNoodle> the servers will serve
[05:24:42] <weeb> Oof, can't argue with that
[05:24:43] <ButterNoodle> until the power runs out
[05:25:08] <weeb> But if a line is cut, say an underseas line.. to be expected when humanity is eradicated, no?
[05:25:12] <ButterNoodle> even when everything is dark.. I imagine some parts would stay up for a long time
[05:25:24] <ButterNoodle> who is gonna cut it?
[05:25:25] <JesseDesu> satellites
[05:25:27] <weeb> The continents would be able to communicate between themselves, but global internet, I'm not so sure
[05:25:41] *** Quits: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:25:43] <weeb> And distribution boxes aren't exactly resilient either
[05:25:49] <ButterNoodle> dont think anyone gonna pilot any submarine 1394 cable cutters
[05:25:56] <weeb> Well not against an apocalypse anyway
[05:25:57] <ButterNoodle> tf
[05:26:02] <JesseDesu> solar powered satellites will continue to work as long as they arent hit by meteorites
[05:26:06] <ButterNoodle> depends on the Apocalypse
[05:26:17] <weeb> Can't argue with that
[05:26:21] <JesseDesu> if their orbits dont destabilize and fall back to earth
[05:26:23] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: they depend on ground stations for telemetry
[05:26:50] <JesseDesu> what
[05:26:52] <ButterNoodle> I think the old gen gps satellites would last 30 days without comms to the ground station
[05:26:57] <JesseDesu> direct signal
[05:27:06] <ButterNoodle> idk about the shit elon put up there
[05:27:10] <weeb> But satellite would only be able to serve satellite users, wouldn't it? Assuming that all humans are gone, kind of a moot point, granted.. but wouldn't it only work at those endpoints?
[05:27:15] <JesseDesu> ok i dunno how satellites work
[05:27:19] <JesseDesu> do you work for nasa
[05:27:21] <JesseDesu> or boeing
[05:27:53] <ButterNoodle> depends on the satellite
[05:28:24] <ButterNoodle> I've sat in on a few amsat project discussions and these things come up
[05:28:52] <weeb> Now I'm curious, what conclusions did you come to?
[05:29:05] <ButterNoodle> wdym
[05:29:26] <weeb> Well, what would happen in an apocalypse to the satellite networks?
[05:29:31] <ButterNoodle> I dont have any conclusions.. just regurgitated information
[05:29:45] <ButterNoodle> actual IP/telecom satellites? idk
[05:30:00] <Sadale> MootPoot, As for JingPad A1, I'd say look for the reviews very carefully. Ensure that the software support is up-to-par. I've seen at least two raspi clones with impressive specs coming from a low-profile Chinese maker that has very bad software support. I'm not sure if the same would go for this tablet.
[05:30:02] <ButterNoodle> depends on if they require comms to a ground station to survive
[05:30:19] <JesseDesu> what about ground stations on the moon
[05:30:28] <JesseDesu> no one would touch them
[05:30:43] <ButterNoodle> the new elon stuff is probably made to communicate and adjust until their service life is over.. which isnt infinite
[05:31:17] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: u just making stuff up.. I dont think there are any earth orbiting satellites that depend on a moon station
[05:31:27] <JesseDesu> i am
[05:31:33] <weeb> True, and it'd surprise me if the Starlink satellites wouldn't be able to link between themselves too
[05:31:44] <JesseDesu> theres oxygen on the moon
[05:31:49] <ButterNoodle> but they have a service life..
[05:32:09] <JesseDesu> nice they have a life
[05:32:11] <weeb> True, they will fail after that
[05:32:18] <ButterNoodle> made to commit seppeku after their best by date
[05:32:19] <weeb> I wonder what they'll do to those, deorbit them?
[05:32:25] <ButterNoodle> yea
[05:32:46] <weeb> Poor sats, but best to do it that way really.. we don't need more shrapnel in our orbits
[05:32:47] <ButterNoodle> idk if they still need ground control to do that
[05:32:51] <JesseDesu> tiny rocket motors
[05:33:44] <JesseDesu> chinese satellite killers are stalking us military spy satellites
[05:34:08] <JesseDesu> ww3 will start in a vaccuum
[05:35:04] <ButterNoodle> another thing.. looking at the ATT norcross telecom hub in atlanta.. that think could probably run for a year from the onsite fuel plant
[05:35:33] <JesseDesu> you eyeballed their fuel supply?

[05:40:31] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Waccha Primagi! | Episode: 9
[05:40:37] <ButterNoodle> weeb: depends
[05:40:58] <JesseDesu> the us and russia have 14,000 nukes combined or something
[05:41:00] <ButterNoodle> tactical nukes with limited range will just destroy electronics in the vacinity
[05:41:06] <JesseDesu> china has several hundred
[05:41:19] <JesseDesu> north korea has a few
[05:41:26] <weeb> I mean the ICBM's would definitely be able to hit the satellites if they want to
[05:41:48] <ButterNoodle> large thermonukes could flatten 100+km areas
[05:41:50] <JesseDesu> icbms are not meant to be that accurate
[05:41:59] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: thats a waste tho
[05:42:12] <JesseDesu> it can miss probably by a mile and still succeed at destroying a city
[05:42:14] <weeb> Maybe a balance of power isn't the right answer to humanity's problems in the first place.. but that's not a very political statement
[05:42:14] <ButterNoodle> when mass casualties are the goal
[05:42:18] <JesseDesu> but probably not a satellite

[05:43:15] <weeb> Interesting, dind't know about that lack of accuracy in ICBM's
[05:43:21] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[05:43:30] <ButterNoodle> they are pretty accurate
[05:43:48] <ButterNoodle> a few hundred yards
[05:44:12] <JesseDesu> it needs to be as accurate as a scud missile
[05:44:27] <JesseDesu> the explosion radius will compensate
[05:44:36] <ButterNoodle> not like putting a 155mm in a toilet bowl at 25km tho
[05:45:09] <JesseDesu> the new airforce/navy missile long range missiles will be optionally hit to kill

[06:05:54] <JesseDesu> hi
[06:09:04] <Sadale> !later tell zoidberg I've found a backup solution that could work for inter-hosting off-site backup: https://www.borgbackup.org/ . And I think that, to save power cost, the backup device doesn't have to run 24/7. Since whoever hosting it is your friend, you could just ping your friend to power on the server, and ping again to power off the server.

[07:45:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mind you, btrfs has a similar capacity.
[07:46:08] <Omega037> morning yall
[07:46:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> btrfs is a lot friendly to progressive growing and scaling of your storage. It, however, doesn't support adding dedicated cache drives yet (while ZFS does)
[07:46:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ZFS supports adding drives you mark dedicated for cache or write-cache (SSDs) and which do only that while the rest of your drives are used for conventional storage or whatever other role you assigned them.
[07:46:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *btrfs a lot more friendly
[07:46:59] <amigojapan> Good afternoon

[07:47:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That setup would work best with zfs, for now.
[07:48:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Had you two SSDs, you could use dm-cache to cache for each individual HDD and use btrfs atop that.
[07:48:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But as you are, ZFS would be simpler to get working.
[07:48:52] <MootPoot> I'm not really concerned with uptimein this case, or a lot of storage
[07:48:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Simply because it directly supports that use-case.
[07:49:06] <MootPoot> so zfs would be the most simple and dumb-proof solution?
[07:49:08] *** Quits: nekos (~n@desupost.soy) (Quit: log off)
[07:49:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In your case, you'd be best-served by using the SSD as a read-cache.
[07:49:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah.
[07:49:23] <MootPoot> what about cost wise?
[07:49:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hm?
[07:49:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> NVMe tends to have better price for TBW than SATA SSDs.
[07:49:59] <MootPoot> sata only
[07:50:04] * Aurora_v_kosmose shrug
[07:50:04] <MootPoot> this is a old surplus box
[07:50:18] <MootPoot> but cost wise I mean - is the cache drive really worth it
[07:50:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They sell PCIe NVMe adapters (but I think PCIe slots are better spent on SAS cards)
[07:50:39] <MootPoot> I dont care about TBW too much - low use system
[07:50:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Depends a lot on the kind of games you play and how much you care about latency.
[07:50:55] <MootPoot> uh
[07:51:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Games tend to use rapid reading a lot more than rapid writing, which is why I recommend the read-cache use.

[07:51:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But it depends too. If you're using games that don't really do asset loading other than in loading screens, it matters a lot less.
[07:52:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Load screens will take ages as they are wont to do on HDDs but it'd be otherwise fine.
[07:53:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The benefit of a read-cache instead of installing directly on the SSD is that you'll get the speed of the SSD (once you've read the data at least once and cached it on the SSD) while getting the sheer storage space of HDDs.

[07:57:24] <Nanobot> Male pigs taste savory, but female pigs taste sower.
[07:57:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, first you need to decide what kinda setup you want to make. If you go with 1 SSD, 2 HDDs(mirrored) or something else.
[07:58:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of note: ZFS & btrfs checksum stuff on read, so if the SSD-cached data is wrong, it'll get it from the other legit copies on the HDDs.
[07:58:28] <MootPoot> 2 mirrored ssds?
[07:58:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That's certainly possible (and recommended for the write-cache use.)
[07:59:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bear in mind you get much less storage per $ with SSDs
[07:59:29] <MootPoot> yeah I dont really need a lot

[07:59:50] <MootPoot> and like maybe 20 gigs per VM
[07:59:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And will you be doing a lot of writes or mainly reads?
[07:59:56] <MootPoot> 500 is more then enough
[08:00:00] <MootPoot> mostly reads I guess
[08:00:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mirrored SSDs might be fine then.
[08:00:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Writes tend to make TBW rating matter a lot more.
[08:00:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Needless to say, never put your swap file on a SSD

[08:13:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mirrors & snapshots aren't backups, but they do often prevent needing to resort to your proper backups (which you should also have for hard-to-replace data)
[08:14:14] <MootPoot> nothing on there is hard to replace, the only thin gis the time and effort to recover from a fuckup
[08:16:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Honestly in that case I'd simply recommend making snapshots before doing config changes.
[08:17:52] * MootPoot looks at the drives in his NAS
[08:18:08] <MootPoot> seems like I have a 4tb, 2tb and 1 which is untrustworthy
[08:18:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'd shove all that in a btrfs raid1 profile and when one dies I'd remove it from the filesystem and rebalance.

[08:27:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's pretty much the same for btrfs & zfs.
[08:27:18] <ButterNoodle> 500 for system, and mechanical for spinning off backups
[08:27:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A restore point from which the filesystem then saves diffs going forward.
[08:27:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sort of.
[08:27:53] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: all I know about zfs is what I read.. I havent actually used it. the literature seems similar
[08:28:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (There's no real diffing mechanism due to CoW not working that way)
[08:28:19] <ButterNoodle> *accomplishes the same user experience - a point in time to revert to
[08:28:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed.
[08:28:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For that matter, qcow(2) is technically the same, since it's "qemu CoW volumes"
[08:29:01] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: you could actually backup ur VMs to NAS if u have enough storage.. and just put drives in for VMs

[08:29:53] <MootPoot> I dont need more then 500gb for everything
[08:30:04] <MootPoot> I just want very regular snapshots of sorts
[08:30:11] <MootPoot> like every 15min or 30 min 
[08:30:15] <MootPoot> to recover from 
[08:30:20] <MootPoot> because I WILL break something
[08:30:25] <ButterNoodle> and to what Aurora_v_kosmose said.. mirroring only keeps u safe in the event of mechanical failure.. not user failure :)
[08:30:31] <ButterNoodle> dood
[08:30:35] <ButterNoodle> that will get costly
[08:30:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, and that basically restricts you to ZFS. Because btrfs performance degrades with that ridiculous amount of snapshots.
[08:30:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You shouldn't do automatic snapshotting anyway.
[08:30:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Especially not at that frequency.
[08:30:55] <MootPoot> well, it just needs to keep the last 3-4 snapshots

[08:31:00] <ButterNoodle> yea for vm snapshots.. you'll just want to snap at the start of surgery
[08:31:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Can't you just think to make a snapshot before making possibly-breaking changes?
[08:31:13] <ButterNoodle> at the end just validate and delete

[08:34:10] <MootPoot> thats it
[08:34:16] <MootPoot> for the storage
[08:34:21] <ButterNoodle> unless u want that ssd speed
[08:34:25] <ButterNoodle> then pickup a 500
[08:34:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh and, of course, don't code/administrate when drunk/high/severely-sleep-deprived unless you can basically do things in your sleep.
[08:34:50] <MootPoot> nah, its a nice to have but it wont get used even close to that much 
[08:34:54] <MootPoot> a hdd is probably fine
[08:34:58] <ButterNoodle> I dont run any ssd's on the big boxes.. they are mechanical in mirrors

[09:28:23] <Nanobot> amigojapan: In the case of Violet Evergarden, the series would have been made even if Netflix had no involvement whatsoever. But, Netflix essentially paid KyoAni money for the right to pretend Netflix helped create it.

[09:36:07] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: anyway I don't want to be escaping from the law either
[09:36:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In terms of NetworkManager: Check the "never use this interface as default route", add a custom route for VPN server, and setup wireguard. Wireguard will add its own route if you allow it 0.0.0.0/0 and the ipv6 equivalent
[09:36:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Wireguard, no question about it.

[09:59:51] <JesseDesu> Aurora_v_kosmose, the russians had the MiG-25 that could fly at mach 3 briefly
[10:00:02] <JesseDesu> but everytime it did, it needed an engine rebuild
[10:00:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, maybe something about those speeds didn't play nice
[10:01:15] <JesseDesu> also the fuel system on the SR-71 was leaky on the ground, when it heated up aerodynamically the joints would expand to seal
[10:01:25] <JesseDesu> which is why they would fuel it at the last minute
[10:01:33] <JesseDesu> by design
[10:01:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That I vaguely recall reading at some point.

[10:02:19] <JesseDesu> i built a 1/72 model of it in 1996

[10:02:55] <JesseDesu> the SR-71 was ahead of its time

[10:03:39] <JesseDesu> there was a weaponized version called the YF-12
[10:04:10] <JesseDesu> and a drone launching mothership variant called the M-21 with a D-21

[10:27:51] <Sadale> zoidberg, It requires a server with SSH access tho. So to have this inter-offsite-backup thingie to work, you'd need your friend to offer you ssh access to his device.
[10:27:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: That's a decent one.
[10:28:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can do it locally too.
[10:28:21] <zoidberg> it has to be ssh Sadale 
[10:28:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can also use forced ssh commands to make it append-only on the remote.
[10:28:28] <Sadale> Aurora_v_kosmose, Here's the context. Me and zoidberg had talked about having the users to offer off-site backup service with each others. It's probably cheaper than commercial cloud service.

[10:33:13] <Sadale> Aurora_v_kosmose, wow. Now it actuall sounds promising. Backing up for each others.
[10:33:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It can be done in the authorized_keys file entries, or if you use SSH CA features, you generate $whatever-borg keys, and then generate restricted certificates with only that permission
[10:33:57] <zoidberg> Sadale: I think it is possible to implement now.
[10:34:13] <Sadale> zoidberg, Not right now. Maybe I could find a user to do a test run of this idea. I've got an unused 16GB USB pendrive that could be used for that.
[10:34:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> --restrict-to-path and --append-only are useful for environments where you don't trust all nodes to not fuck with eachother due to compromise or whatever.

[10:35:06] <Sadale> zoidberg, oh and I've actually got an old raspi. It only supports up to 100Mbps ethernet tho. But it should be good enough because my internet's slower than that. :P The main problem is that I'm not sure if the CPU and RAM's enough.
[10:35:30] <Sadale> zoidberg, what's the bandwidth of your home internet?
[10:35:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In the authorized_keys file, the "restrict" keyword does effectively the same as generating a certificate with the option "clear" (for clearing out all default permissions)
[10:35:39] * MootPoot throws his atomic pi at Sadales raspberry pi and smushes it

[10:35:53] <zoidberg> let me check
[10:36:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No default permission certs get to validate they can authenticate & connect, then get logged out because they're not allowed to actually do anything.
[10:36:10] <MootPoot> No money for what?
[10:36:20] <Sadale> zoidberg, With this internet speed, the first run's gonna take a while. But the second run would have deduplicaton. So it'll be much faster.
[10:36:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, atomic pi
[10:36:41] <Sadale> actually, more like no space
[10:36:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: zoidberg: borgbackup synchronizes a cache of checksums for the blocks already in the repository with the clients.

[10:37:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So the client will first download that, then send only stuff it doesn't generate blocks matching known checkusms.

[10:38:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So right, borg clients download the cache of block hashes, then generates blocks for its stuff as normal while backuping. If, however, before sending it detects a match in the cache, it notifies the server that block is in use, doesn't reupload it, and moves on.

[10:40:04] <Sadale> zoidberg, interesting. up is higher than down.
[10:40:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> This can (and should) be set up via cronjobs.
[10:40:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: That's unusual.
[10:40:34] <Sadale> zoidberg, Mine's 25mbps down 1mbps up (!). Perhaps something's wrong with my connection. Previously my speed were higher than that.
[10:40:40] <zoidberg> but I have a limit though, bandwidth is downgraded after some TB

[10:42:18] <zoidberg> Sadale: so the plan is to backup our files on someone else's? Why not just use our own backup?

[10:44:35] <zoidberg> honestly I don't have enough data to back up
[10:44:40] <zoidberg> sadly :(
[10:44:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That last part I say mainly because it has some pretty clear budget constraints.
[10:45:03] <zoidberg> what do you backup Sadale, Aurora_v_kosmose?
[10:45:12] <Sadale> zoidberg, full system backup probably
[10:45:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Pretty much.
[10:45:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well. Data mainly.
[10:45:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I mentioned moving my stuff to Ansible & now to Packer+Cloud-Init?
[10:45:41] <zoidberg> Sadale: what's in the system? what kind of data? code? libraries?

[10:45:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Means I only need the data. The actual server images and whatnot are completely worthless.
[10:45:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can regenerate them trivially.
[10:46:17] <Sadale> zoidberg, everything. The most important stuffs are the unreproducible data tho, like code and stuffs that I make. But if I'm lazy I'd just backup everything inside my filesystem
[10:46:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So, automation configuration (for rebuilding everything) and my data are what I backup.
[10:46:46] <zoidberg> Sadale: use git!
[10:46:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> git is not backup.
[10:47:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It does facilitate creating effective backups via offsite mirrors.
[10:47:19] <zoidberg> well, you can use it like backup

[10:49:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of course other configuration management systems will have other mechanisms for this.
[10:49:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hashicorp vault also has different ways.
[10:50:20] <zoidberg> that's nice feature
[10:51:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I haven't been using it much because I mostly rely on self-hosted stuff so I can fully go the certs/keys/token way
[10:51:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A compromised key is simply added to the automatically deployed KRLs or, in wireguard's case, removed from the accepted configuration list.
[10:52:59] <zoidberg> how do they check for these kinds of unauthorised sections of code and see if they have got the permissions?

[10:54:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So if I statically assign wireguard IPs and know what they're supposed to match, it makes it pretty easy to use that as an authorization layer.
[10:54:08] <MootPoot> Hungry now
[10:54:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For other programs it depends. For SSH, sshd supports KRLs (key revocation list) which it checks when authenticating a key.
[10:54:35] <zoidberg> MootPoot: get some food man, make some if you have any!
[10:54:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If it matches in the KRL it's automatically rejected.

[10:56:50] <zoidberg> Aurora_v_kosmose: I mean uploading it to git, how do they check?
[10:57:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> zoidberg: Git is version control system. It's not a given git host.
[10:57:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Github can search through its stuff. But they mostly don't. If your repos are public, then web crawlers can find them.
[10:57:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If they're private then it's a lot harder.
[10:58:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The thing is that any host you push code onto (using git or some other dvcs) implicitly means you trust the host with read access.
[10:58:55] <zoidberg> ouch
[10:59:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There are addons to git that allow you to encrypt repos, if that's your thing.

It blocks the road and the transit. It's a bad thing to the economy here. Then the government subdue the riots by implement all those new laws. While it's nice to have

[14:18:22] <zoidberg> okay
[14:18:44] <Sadale> zoidberg, And let's assume that Sadale and zoidberg are off-site backup partners. So Sadale would purchase A and B. zoidberg would purchase C.

[14:21:19] <Sadale> zoidberg, In the first backup, Sadale writes his backup to A and send it to zoidberg. zoidberg writes backup to B and send it to Sadale.

[14:29:01] <amigojapan> Zoidberg in Japan you are not allowed to sell things on the streets
[14:29:05] <zoidberg> noo, I hope he's not

[14:29:22] <zoidberg> yes amigojapan, that's kind of sad really

[14:30:26] <zoidberg> not like me, I am an asshole at times
[14:31:04] <hassoon> zoidberg: who
[14:31:23] <zoidberg> pretender: yup, some days he gets so tired that he just eats plain bread
[14:31:41] <zoidberg> hassoon: I am talking about a friend of mine

[14:32:15] <pretender> Finally weechat notification
[14:32:42] <zoidberg> yes pretender, I have his number but I don't know to contact him or not
[14:32:57] <amigojapan> pretender: all you need is a script
[14:33:47] <amigojapan> zoidberg: do it. You will regret it if you don't
[14:34:05] <zoidberg> yeah
[14:34:45] <Sadale> zoidberg, hmm. So I'm wondering. If you'd be interested in joining this off-site backup plan. Not right now. But when we both have the time for that xD
[14:35:23] <pretender> Yep
[14:35:28] <amigojapan> zoidberg: do you rest on weekends in India?
[14:35:45] <zoidberg> usually I am busy on weekends amigojapan 
[14:36:13] <amigojapan> zoidberg: but like employees get any days off?
[14:36:32] <zoidberg> Sure Sadale. How much would it all cost? 300 USD?
[14:36:33] <Sadale> That's a problem of being your own boss :(
[14:36:36] <pretender> amigojapan: I just installed using cygwin on Windows and it has notification already, maybe preinstalled plugin
[14:36:44] <Sadale> zoidberg, probably. And we'll split the cost.
[14:36:49] <zoidberg> amigojapan: they do
[14:36:57] <Sadale> zoidberg, oh it depends on the storage size tho
[14:37:13] <zoidberg> Sadale: so we offer this service to others right?
[14:37:22] <Sadale> zoidberg, For 1TB, $300 should be enough, Divided by two that'd be $150 per person. Not including shipping fee. 
[14:37:34] <Sadale> zoidberg, hmm. I mean two users are enough. xD
[14:37:59] <amigojapan> pretender: I thought you said you were using wsl. But you also use cygwin? Why not run Linux as your main OS or as dual boot?
[14:38:03] <Sadale> zoidberg, you could offer it to others if you want tho. Each pair of backup partners would take you $150.
[14:38:09] <amigojapan> Ah ok zoidberg
[14:38:47] <Sadale> zoidberg, as for the storage I think you can use SD card or USB pendrive or SSD.
[14:39:50] <zoidberg> I see. I am not sure how reliable sd card would be
[14:40:12] <Sadale> That's what I'm worried about as well. SSD is probably more reliable. But it may be more difficult to ship.
[14:40:24] <Sadale> It's more bulky and the custom clearance people may seize it for lulz.
[14:40:41] <zoidberg> yeah
[14:40:41] <Sadale> Anyway SSD is actually the cheapest if you're talking about the hardware cost.
[14:41:04] <Sadale> And we don't really need 100% reliability when it comes to shipping. It's just a backup anyway.
[14:41:24] <pretender> amigojapan: Oh yes, I was using irssi on WSL2 last night, but now I use weechat on Windows, I do want to switch back to Linux as my main OS, but I still need Adobe Products. Oh and my games, there is only one that is running perfectly with wine
[14:41:43] <death916> jsu stick wit wsl

[15:03:05] <pretender> I want to live in japan, and work remotely
[15:04:24] <amigojapan> pretender: that is doable, do you have a bachelor's degree?
[15:05:23] <zoidberg> pretender: you might suffer from Paris Syndrome 
[15:05:48] <omero> amigojapan: several days ago... you linked some restaurant whose name was 8-something
[15:05:58] <amigojapan> Zoidberg many people want to live in Japan
[15:06:12] <omero> is that common practice for restaurants in japan?
[15:06:17] <amigojapan> omero: 8lounge
[15:06:31] <zoidberg> yeah, me too amigojapan but I just couldn't do it because of various reasons
[15:06:32] <omero> It kind of struck me...

[15:08:00] <omero> lol... I think Im a bit lost among several 'conversations' happening here all at once :P
[15:08:04] <amigojapan> 8:36 PM <omero> is "that" common practice for restaurants in japan?
[15:08:28] <omero> ah, I meant the "8-" something
[15:09:02] <amigojapan> Ah no omero . It was the restaurant of the 8hotel
[15:09:03] <omero> it struck me because It reminded me of fairy tail
[15:09:38] <omero> there (in fairy tail) you have the 8-Island restaurant
[15:09:44] <pretender> amigojapan: I'm still in high school
[15:10:04] <amigojapan> omero: I see

[15:54:16] <Sadale> zoidberg, now that I think again. There's a problem with the ABC off-site backup design. Incremental backup/deduplicated backup wouldn't work with only three storage devices.
[15:54:44] <Sadale> zoidberg, To make incremental backup work, you'd actually need 4 storage devices. :(
[15:55:06] <hans> Sadale, ???
[15:55:37] <pretender> Aah I need a name

[16:17:08] <Sadale> hans, I'm actually worried about those cheap commercial hosting. the problem is that they do it for profit and they could go bankrupt any time.

[16:21:23] <Sadale> davic, For male the prostate is only accessible via the butthole. So it makes sense to use it on male.

[17:09:12] <Satin> that it's not related to cancer
[17:09:27] <Cryowolf> it's just a hernia

[17:09:31] <Satin> can you walk and stuff normally?
[17:09:37] <hassoon> Cryowolf: wa'r yo doin'
[17:09:41] <Cryowolf> the cause is likely poor healing cause they cut me open where its now splitting
[17:09:44] <Bco1981> hassoon: no~
[17:10:02] <Cryowolf> Satin, no, walking too much with the ¬¥hernia makes me ill
[17:10:13] <Satin> oof i see 
[17:10:19] <Satin> hope you can after then
[17:10:21] <Cryowolf> I'm getting an hernia support on Dec 1, I think
[17:10:26] <Cryowolf> to use until surgery
[17:10:26] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: good luck on sugery

[17:26:19] <KatrinValerie> The standard is not what you read to learn

[17:40:52] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, I remember that it was a large scale game. Was it WoW?
[17:41:05] <isekaijin> KatrinValerie: Calling native code from .NET is actually rather easy.
[17:41:06] <KatrinValerie> I also developed a neat little signature scanning tool for important World of Warcraft stuff
[17:41:11] <isekaijin> Calling native code from Java is a pain.
[17:41:30] <KatrinValerie> and I used that to update a struct/enum dumper from the community
[17:41:43] <isekaijin> Like, ‚Äúdo not try it unless you absolutely need it... sometimes even reimplementing the stuff in Java is less painful‚Äù level of pain.
[17:41:50] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: hosting the .net runtime in a foreign process is the hard part.
[17:41:54] <isekaijin> Oh.
[17:42:07] <KatrinValerie> marshalling just requires knowledge of function signatures
[17:42:23] <berlingo36> yo Roey 
[17:42:30] <KatrinValerie> You need to specify the correct calling conventions etc
[17:42:53] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: if it's not exported functions you might even need to do some assambler trickery
[17:43:37] <KatrinValerie> And I was mostly interested in hijacking a few internal functions of WoW, so my dll could do it's dirty work
[17:44:39] <isekaijin> What tools did you use to find the internal functions' entry points, argument types, etc.?
[17:44:51] <KatrinValerie> oh right, I also built a gravity cheat that just wrote some asm stubs into WoW to trick the falldamage function
[17:45:18] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: mostly ollydbg for live debugging and IDA Pro for static debugging
[17:45:26] <isekaijin> Nice.
[17:45:40] <KatrinValerie> And knowing about what kind of function calls a compiler creates is handy too
[17:45:58] <KatrinValerie> WoW was compiled with a version of msvc++ at the time
[17:46:11] <KatrinValerie> And that one is documented in depth

[18:58:06] <DunceCotus> Leerning Chanel
[18:58:08] <Jason_Waterfalls> they were popular in the 90s
[19:00:37] <KingKeA> wait you were microchipped?
[19:00:41] <KingKeA> i KNEW it
[19:03:37] <KingKeA> between the vaccines and 5g we're doomed.
[19:05:04] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I should know it from the 90s, interesting video, does it have a deep meaning, what's up with the pictures changing?
[19:05:30] <Jason_Waterfalls> idk lol
[19:05:39] <amigojapan> Alright
[19:05:44] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  but the main takeaway is that you should not join a street gang
[19:05:48] <Jason_Waterfalls> so don't do that
[19:07:43] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I thought he was buying drugs
[19:07:51] <amigojapan> But yeah
[19:07:54] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh he was
[19:08:09] <Jason_Waterfalls> or maybe he was buying the star wars holiday special, we never actually see it
[19:08:34] <amigojapan> Right, it's in a bag
[19:08:39] <Jason_Waterfalls> exactly
[19:08:58] <Jason_Waterfalls> and maybe he didn't die. he had a stroke and they all ran away
[19:09:00] <Jason_Waterfalls> but he's fine
[19:09:14] <Jason_Waterfalls> or maybe he just tripped and they freaked out
[19:09:18] <Jason_Waterfalls> "wtf i'm fine guys!"
[19:10:26] <amigojapan> Well staying away from illegal drugs is a good message
[19:10:51] <Jason_Waterfalls> i think the message is just overall to not get tangled up in bad stuff
[19:11:09] <amigojapan> Right
[19:11:12] <Jason_Waterfalls> and also, that jason waterfalls should not leave
[19:13:21] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: ok at least now I know what you and Nanobot were taking about the other day and yes. I don't think they say "go go Jason waterfalls

[19:57:54] <DunceCotus> its clear there were explosions in the towers
[19:57:58] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  of course
[19:58:02] <DunceCotus> there were no planes hitting towers

[19:58:08] <DunceCotus> nobody witnessed that
[19:58:13] <Jason_Waterfalls> FUCK I WANT IT

[19:58:43] <Jason_Waterfalls> DunceCotus:  in 2001??

[19:59:57] <Cryowolf> comparing anime from 10 years ago to today and when they make childrens voices, they do them a lot better and less grating to the ear today. Maybe cause they can use software to manipulate the voice a bit so the seiyuu doesnt need to go up to the highest pitch that can shatter glass

[20:08:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: why didn't they use CGI for weapons of mass destruction? 
[20:08:36] <amigojapan> Yeah DunceCotus , sounds easy
[20:08:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well that's the thing, it worked best as a threat
[20:08:52] <Cryowolf> no theyre good characters and I think he's supposed to be unlikable in a way. He's there to show the pathetic side of humanity that we all have and loathe
[20:08:55] <DunceCotus> not as a demonstration
[20:09:01] <amigojapan> And no witnesses to say otherwise like in 9/11
[20:09:06] <DunceCotus> you can't really demonstrate it without well causing mass destruction
[20:09:06] <Cryowolf> while simultaneously being kind of a smart guy when it comes to it
[20:10:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: just have some people walking into a barn using hazmat suits and saying "yes, we found it"
[20:11:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: also according to you they have nothing against causing mass destruction
[20:11:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: if they found it there'd be independent inquiry into what was found
[20:11:34] <Cryowolf> You know what's nice about a memory foam/cold foam bed? You have a flat surface pretty much right next to where you're lying down and you can use that for a computer mouse
[20:11:35] <DunceCotus> which is what happened anyway
[20:11:36] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf 
[20:12:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the weapons of mass destruction thing was more to keep that area militarized
[20:12:18] <DunceCotus> if they found it, no more need to stay, or less of one
[20:12:30] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I use a trackball
[20:13:01] <Cryowolf> cant play games with that
[20:13:08] <DunceCotus> they knew they'd need something to tie over the people aside from taking down Osama etc.
[20:13:25] <DunceCotus> even that took ages
[20:13:30] <amigojapan> Alright DunceCotus but there was little visual effort put into that, it is nothing like 9/11
[20:13:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: 9/11 is definitely an order of magnitude more conniving
[20:14:11] <DunceCotus> but I dunno, it seems unlikely taliban could have pulled it off without help from USA anyway
[20:14:34] <DunceCotus> so perhaps there was no hijacking of planes or there was but they didn't crash into towers
[20:14:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: "weapons of mass destruction"was just a lie, that's easy
[20:14:41] <DunceCotus> the towers were taken down by beam weapons
[20:15:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: 9/11 isn't entirely a lie but the enduring narrative isn't entirely the truth either
[20:16:10] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: CGI would be hard to pull off
[20:16:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: 9/11 was a kill many birds with one (or two) stone approach

[20:19:19] <DunceCotus> I don't think a plane would take down those towers

[20:19:30] <DunceCotus> which randomly fell

[20:21:00] <SummerSkies> amigojapan: how is it going
[20:21:03] <Omega037> DunceCotus, I don't think any building could take a hit from a 747

[20:21:09] <SummerSkies> I never did hear what ended up of the train station situation
[20:21:15] <Omega037> A bunker could
[20:21:16] <DunceCotus> Omega037: the energy generated by them hitting the building would not have been enough to dustify them
[20:21:24] <DunceCotus> there's more to the story than the planes
[20:21:32] <DunceCotus> if the planes even hit
[20:21:35] <Omega037> DunceCotus, do you have a PhD in physics
[20:21:39] <Omega037> or Structural engineering?
[20:21:41] <DunceCotus> that could be CGI in the footage sent to media
[20:21:43] <amigojapan> SummerSkies: I should be sleeping, but but sleepy yet
[20:21:50] <Omega037> Do you *want* there to be a conspiracy?
[20:21:59] <Cryowolf> here we go
[20:22:10] <DunceCotus> Omega037: its not about what I want
[20:22:14] <Omega037> The real question is *why* you want there to be one
[20:22:20] <Omega037> There is because of confirmation bias
[20:22:24] <amigojapan> SummerSkies: we took the alternate route
[20:22:39] <Omega037> Do you accept the null hypothesis until enough evidence makes you switch
[20:22:43] <DunceCotus> Omega037: I do not have a phd in physics but jet fuel can't melt steel beams 
[20:22:49] <Omega037> Or do you go looking for evidence to prove what you want
[20:23:04] <DunceCotus> I find evidence even when not looking
[20:23:08] <Omega037> Or better put, if you put all your cards on the table and I were to specifically refute each one
[20:23:23] <Omega037> Would you then accept it wasnt some inside job, or would you go look for new evidence it was?
[20:23:37] <Omega037> If it is the latter, there is no point to discuss it because you arent being objective
[20:23:50] <DunceCotus> Omega037: I would accept its not an inside job
[20:24:07] <DunceCotus> but I just don't think one can provide evidence enough either way
[20:24:10] <DunceCotus> so its a mystery 
[20:24:20] <Omega037> Sure they can
[20:24:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it could still be an inside job even if no CGI was used
[20:24:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sure
[20:24:46] <Omega037> benefit of years of this stupid conspiracy stuff has led to massive work disproving the various arguments
[20:24:56] <DunceCotus> I just have my doubts about the planes cause the footage looks a bit ropey
[20:25:01] <DunceCotus> but who knows
[20:25:22] <Omega037> My second highest rated comment on reddit was about this
[20:25:30] <DunceCotus> Omega037: congrats
[20:25:50] <Omega037> I basically got the guy to agree that if I could provide reasonable, documented explanations for all of the "inconsistencies" he had, he would accept it was not a conspiracy
[20:26:00] <Omega037> Then I just had to look them all up and provide them
[20:26:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: probably cause that is not a common thing to happen, it did look surreal
[20:26:14] <Jason_Waterfalls> are we still talking about 9/11 ?

[20:27:22] <Jason_Waterfalls> lol
[20:27:25] <Jason_Waterfalls> this guy is sooo good
[20:27:28] <Jason_Waterfalls> i love him
[20:27:30] <Cryowolf> Omega037, nothing is out of scope
[20:27:38] <Omega037> I'm about 322 chapters in, but realizing that despite there being 700+ chapters translated, it is probably going to be weekly releases for the next 15 years
[20:27:59] <Omega037> Unfortunately, manga that is popular tends to be incomplete and frequently updated manga
[20:27:59] <Jason_Waterfalls> i sometimes wonder how it would have been to grow up in brazil...
[20:28:28] <Omega037> Finding popular completed stuff seems much harder, since all the sites and algos are geared towards the serialized model
[20:28:34] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I grew up in Mexico
[20:28:45] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  i know
[20:29:15] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: spoonm lives in Brazil

[20:29:52] <Jason_Waterfalls> awesome!
[20:30:14] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  oh it is me, frankie. 
[20:30:26] <Jason_Waterfalls> i just thought the jason waterfalls name was funny
[20:30:42] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: oh. You switch names and catch me off guard
[20:31:07] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  yeah lol
[20:31:36] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I have a bit disappointing news
[20:31:56] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh?
[20:32:30] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: the student that asked me twice to teach her chess, ended up telling me she was no longer interested
[20:32:40] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh that sucks
[20:32:46] <amigojapan> Yeah
[20:32:53] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  oh well
[20:32:59] <amigojapan> Yup
[20:33:21] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I was going to use lichess
[20:33:39] <Cryowolf> Omega037, if I was to make a manga that ran "infinitely", I would have an end point, a goal which can be finetuned to fit the journey better but that I always know 'how' I want to end it. Then I might write down changes and experiences I want the characters to have and then I get down to how the world impacts them and they impact the world as well as the smaller 1v1 battled individual stuff. I would have to make the power scaling believable, so you don't 
[20:33:39] <Cryowolf> just sit there and wonder why the next bad guy more powerful than the one before, waited for them to finish. So having them exploring an island or another dimension or something where the further in they get, the stronger the people who also got there would have to be. As well as the enemies born there
[20:33:45] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: cause it is a remote lesson
[20:34:01] *** Quits: kyyyq (~kyyyq@178.209.252.2) (Quit: Connection closed)
[20:34:08] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  oh yeah, lichess is great
[20:34:22] <Cryowolf> but I really dont like infinite manga or anime unless it's like finished its ultra-long run and I can binge hundreds of episodes (assuming it's good)
[20:35:16] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: usually those long animes start out ok. And get worse later on
[20:35:31] <Cryowolf> One Piece was the opposite imo
[20:36:22] <Jason_Waterfalls> i can do a long series, but i have a distaste for filler
[20:36:27] <Cryowolf> It started out rather annoying without much serious tone at all or interesting story other than "I WANT TO BE PIRATE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and then it became about the emperors, the 100 year war, the lost age, the gylphs etc
[20:36:44] <Jason_Waterfalls> not that i dislike slow moments
[20:37:20] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  do you play chess sometimes these days?
[20:37:53] <Cryowolf> If my Light Novel ever comes anywhere (yeah Im bringing it up again.) I'm gonna have multiple stories so once I finish a story about a character. I can do another one about another character in another location of the same world and build up a whole universe there
[20:38:04] <Cryowolf> then it would go on forever, without becoming stupid
[20:38:19] <Cryowolf> and fillers wouldn't be noticable if there ever was one
[20:38:36] <amigojapan> Not really Jason_Waterfalls .I am not a good chess player. This student just asked me out of the blue.i thought "at least I can teach how the pieces move
[20:38:40] <Cryowolf> if there's a 2 volume filler arc, since that would be the normal approach
[20:38:49] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  oh for sure
[20:38:57] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  as usual, feel free to challenge me to chess lol
[20:39:14] <Jason_Waterfalls> the pandemic kinda made me a lot better at it
[20:39:19] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I am sure I don't stand a chance
[20:39:29] <Jason_Waterfalls> hey, i'm not alpha zero lol
[20:39:35] <Jason_Waterfalls> i'm still a flesh and blood human
[20:39:37] <Jason_Waterfalls> (for now)
[20:40:07] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: ok. Let's try a game when it is not 2am here
[20:40:12] <Jason_Waterfalls> lol fair
[20:40:31] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu | Episode: 9
[20:41:31] <Cryowolf> more popular digital card games should use dices as a supplement to the cards
[20:41:57] <Cryowolf> for example, you're about to cast a spell and you can use mana to roll dices for a chance that it will deal more damage (or less)
[20:42:06] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: is there something like lichess for shougi?
[20:42:11] <Cryowolf> or even fizzle out or go "ultmate critical
[20:42:12] <Jason_Waterfalls> cryowolf in magic we do use dice for cards
[20:42:18] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  YES THERE IS
[20:42:20] <Jason_Waterfalls> let me find it
[20:42:27] <Cryowolf> I dont play magic and magic online isn't very big
[20:42:34] <Cryowolf> it can also cost a fortune to get into
[20:42:45] <Jason_Waterfalls> https://lishogi.org/
[20:42:47] <ImoutoBot> [title] lishogi.org ‚Ä¢ Free Online Shogi
[20:43:01] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  isn't big?
[20:43:11] <Cryowolf> though hearthstone is gonna cost me 80 euro if I want the latest and biggest pack 
[20:43:14] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  you're right about it costing a lot of money
[20:43:16] <Cryowolf> Jason_Waterfalls, the ONLINE part
[20:43:31] <Jason_Waterfalls> i find magic more accessible than hearthstone by a mile
[20:43:32] <Cryowolf> offline it's the biggest card game in the world
[20:43:43] <amigojapan> Ah near Jason_Waterfalls maybe let's try both a chess and a shougi match
[20:43:51] <Jason_Waterfalls> i play mtg arena sometimes. i never have a hard time getting a match
[20:44:12] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  sounds good. i haven't played shougi in a hot minute, but i got kind of into it after watching 'march comes in like a lion' lol
[20:44:22] <Cryowolf> now that hearthstone has Battlegrounds, Mercenaries, Duels, Arena, Tavern Brawl and Ranked, that's a lot of ways to play
[20:44:27] <Jason_Waterfalls> but as you know i've been playing chess since i was small 
[20:44:32] <Cryowolf> Mercenaries, Duels and Battlegrounds is most fun
[20:44:36] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, if I am to do esspresso, what beans do I buy
[20:44:37] <Cryowolf> Battlegrounds is like autochess
[20:44:40] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  sure. arena still doesn't have commander
[20:45:21] <Cryowolf> mercenaries is kinda like "dungeon crawling" with characters that have stats and skills to use vs enemies, you gather awards and then you can challenge other players in pvp
[20:45:31] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh that is interesting
[20:45:40] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: also. I would like the matches not to be timmed matches.i need time to think
[20:45:48] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  oh no doubt
[20:45:54] <Cryowolf> you have 3 characters and they run the triangle dmg system
[20:46:09] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  i remember we played shougi a bunch of years ago, and i was far less familiar with the rules then
[20:46:16] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  for sure
[20:46:22] <Cryowolf> fighter damages dps damages caster damages fighter
[20:46:34] <Cryowolf> fighter > dps > spell > fighter
[20:46:35] <Jason_Waterfalls> i remember trying to play hearthstone and thinking all decks were way better than mine lol
[20:46:38] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I don't remember, sorry
[20:46:42] <Cryowolf> for who they're weak to
[20:46:44] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  it's all good lol
[20:46:51] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  i also play go!
[20:47:01] <Jason_Waterfalls> i'm like 17 kyu in that??
[20:47:03] <Cryowolf> Jason_Waterfalls, you can always play battlegrounds as a focus to collect gold
[20:47:09] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  right
[20:47:15] <Cryowolf> while doing quests and starter quests etc to get card packs
[20:47:18] <Jason_Waterfalls> for sure
[20:47:20] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I have no idea how to do strategy in go
[20:47:27] <Cryowolf> battlegrounds doesn't require any cards
[20:47:32] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  yeah obviously it's pretty complicated
[20:47:47] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  oh... huh
[20:47:49] <Cryowolf> mercenaries is entirely separate from the regular card game, with its own menu etc
[20:47:53] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh okay
[20:48:09] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: how about reverssi?
[20:48:12] <Jason_Waterfalls> i may play it sometime
[20:48:17] <Cryowolf> in battlegrounds you start and get to choose from 2 or 4 heroes (4 if you buy the upgrade for either cash  or 2000 gold)
[20:48:21] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  lol i haven't played that since the early 90s
[20:48:32] <Jason_Waterfalls> i have played othello 
[20:48:37] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: I like it
[20:48:50] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  so kind of like DOTA/
[20:48:51] <Jason_Waterfalls> ??
[20:49:02] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan i haven't played that in forever 
[20:49:14] <Cryowolf> then you buy and sell and play minions in a strategic way, you switch between "bartender" (area where you buy sell etc) and then once time runs out, they autofight
[20:49:30] <Jason_Waterfalls> okay
[20:49:39] <Cryowolf> No you don't control them, it's very mathematical cause of synergy and so on
[20:49:44] <Jason_Waterfalls> oh
[20:50:09] <Cryowolf> and thats what you do preparing for next fight, while you upgrade for next level etc
[20:50:21] <Jason_Waterfalls> for sure

[20:50:50] <Cryowolf> once you're read or everyone else is, the match is over. You go 1v1 vs 7 other players. Top 4 = win, but only 1 = real win
[20:51:00] <Cryowolf> I could stream it but I dunno where
[20:51:04] <amigojapan> Jason_Waterfalls: on a time when I am less sleepy, let's try a match of chess, a match of shougi and a match of reverssi
[20:51:17] <Jason_Waterfalls> amigojapan:  i am all for it
[20:51:29] <Jason_Waterfalls> i may have to refamiliarize myself on reversi
[20:51:35] <amigojapan> Good good :)
[20:51:38] <Jason_Waterfalls> Cryowolf:  idk twitch??

[22:14:05] <MootPoot> I've been thinking of eventually getting like a enameled cast iron or cermaic thing
[22:14:08] <MootPoot> but $$$$$$
[22:14:11] <MootPoot> and so hard to find
[22:14:57] <emmeka> the problem with enamel is that you have to get rid of it if the enamel is comprimised
[22:15:14] <MootPoot> the enamel is just glass right?
[22:15:14] <emmeka> MootPoot just get real cast iron, at some flea market or garage sale or whatever
[22:15:25] <MootPoot> I do have a cast iron but its such a pain
[22:15:29] <MootPoot> having to re-surface it 
[22:15:31] <MootPoot> every time
[22:15:35] <MootPoot> every week*
[22:15:47] <emmeka> it's porcelain, I think
[22:15:59] <emmeka> MootPoot how exactly are you using your cast iron that this is necessary
[22:16:25] <emmeka> properly season your pan once, don't cook acidic foods in it regularly, scrape clean with hot water and *never* soap
[22:16:30] <MootPoot> uh, I surface it in the oven, then I use it for eggs and shit for a week , then stuff starts sticking
[22:16:37] <MootPoot> o-oh
[22:16:43] <MootPoot> you're not supposed to use soap?
[22:16:46] <MootPoot> umm
[22:16:46] <emmeka> ...
[22:16:50] <emmeka> you've probably ruined it
[22:17:03] <emmeka> but no, you are absolutely not supposed to use soap on cast iron
[22:17:06] <MootPoot> I read the soap nowdays is different so it dosent matter
[22:17:09] <MootPoot> anymore
[22:17:37] <emmeka> you read wrong. soap is bad because it removes oil/grease. the oil/grease baked into the steel is your seasoning
[22:18:38] <MootPoot> QUORA LIED TO ME
[22:18:43] <MootPoot> or well, the internet
[22:18:59] <MootPoot> rip
[22:19:02] <MootPoot> is my pan fucked
[22:19:08] <emmeka> MootPoot so here's what you do. Go rinse that pan good with hot water, scrape everything you can off the cooking surface. Use steel wool, bristle brush, whatever.
[22:20:20] <MootPoot> I usually use butter to cook my stuff at a low-med heat
[22:20:27] <emmeka> then, coat it liberally with a neutral cooking oil (vegetable, canola, corn, sunflower, whatever) and bake the pan in the oven as high as you can without going far over the oil's smoke point.
[22:20:29] <MootPoot> when I'm done cooking do I rinse it off
[22:20:34] <MootPoot> with hot water
[22:20:35] <MootPoot> or leave it on
[22:20:38] <ButterNoodle> wut
[22:20:40] <ButterNoodle> the
[22:20:42] <ButterNoodle> fuck
[22:20:46] <MootPoot> lol
[22:20:57] <emmeka> MootPoot you need to season your pan to un-fuck it
[22:21:10] <ButterNoodle> ^
[22:21:12] <MootPoot> yes - I got a bottle of grapevine or something oil for that
[22:21:25] <MootPoot> internet also told me that oil lasts the longest
[22:21:27] <MootPoot> for seasoning
[22:21:28] <emmeka> coat it with oil, bake the pan. Take it out, wipe it down, let it cool/dry. Then do it again.
[22:21:45] <ButterNoodle> rinse repeat for 100 years
[22:21:48] <emmeka> grapeseed oil is good. it has a very high smoking point.
[22:21:57] <emmeka> so you can season it very hot
[22:21:58] <ButterNoodle> if u got soap into it.. idk if it will ever be right
[22:22:41] <emmeka> yes first you must rinse and scrap every micron of everything you can off that pan to get it down to porous steel
[22:22:49] <emmeka> otherwise there is no hope
[22:22:59] <MootPoot> shite
[22:23:23] <ButterNoodle> u dun fukd up son
[22:23:27] <emmeka> yep.
[22:23:27] <Bco1981> hololive legal loli
[22:23:42] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: ur banned
[22:23:43] <ButterNoodle> in china
[22:24:03] <MootPoot> all the results for "use soap in cast iron" on the first page
[22:24:05] <MootPoot> are all 
[22:24:09] <MootPoot> yeah you can
[22:24:14] <Bco1981> well... i wasn't planing on going there anyway.
[22:24:16] <emmeka> all my cast iron are from Japan, actually. I got them at a flea market maybe 10 years ago. The person wanted $10 each for them and I said I'd give them $10 for the lot. Sold.
[22:24:23] <MootPoot> but rip I guess  - I'll try scraping
[22:24:57] <MootPoot> I wonder if its possible to re-surface a teflon pan
[22:25:00] <MootPoot> that would be nice
[22:25:16] <MootPoot> send it back to get re-surfaced
[22:25:22] <emmeka> they're from the 70s or something
[22:27:08] <ButterNoodle> japanese from the 70s have really hairy bush
[22:27:23] <Bco1981> don't they still have that ?
[22:27:23] <ButterNoodle> not like 70s american afro pron tho
[22:27:28] <ButterNoodle> naa
[22:27:36] <emmeka> MootPoot but here's the thing, soap on cast iron is bad no matter what anyone says because a cast iron pan is only as good as its oil seasoning, and soaps remove or disintegrate oils. That's what a soap fundamentally is.
[22:27:38] <ButterNoodle> most that I see are reasonably trimmed
[22:27:52] <Bco1981> well in porn, meaybe not. but the average japanese woman... probablyt
[22:27:57] <Bco1981> probably*
[22:28:04] <emmeka> if your seasoning is *really* well established, and you use soap once, it probably won't matter
[22:28:11] <ButterNoodle> and the soap will get into the pours of the pan and make everything taste like ur soap
[22:28:54] <emmeka> but if your seasoning isn't super good, as in you didn't oil, bake, cool, wipe and repeat that at least 5 times, and you're using soap all the time...
[22:29:49] <MootPoot> what if I told you that I left it on the countertop one time and uh..during a family meet somebody decided to dishwasher it
[22:30:03] <emmeka> christ
[22:30:04] <MootPoot> hypotetically of course
[22:30:17] <MootPoot> everyone in my family assumes every pan is the same
[22:30:28] <MootPoot> so it got dunked in a sink of soapy water for an hour
[22:30:31] <MootPoot> then dishwashed
[22:30:42] <MootPoot> .....
[22:30:46] <MootPoot> that pan is fucked isen't it
[22:30:46] <ButterNoodle> I'd hypothetically stab them to death and nutt in their corpse
[22:31:09] <emmeka> MootPoot it's going to take a lot of elbow grease to unfuck it
[22:31:11] <ButterNoodle> well unless u like the taste of both dawn and cascade...
[22:31:26] <ButterNoodle> I'd say its ok for that
[22:32:17] <MootPoot> I left it with solidified butter on it - they saw it and assumed it was dirty
[22:32:18] <MootPoot> rip
[22:32:39] <MootPoot> emmeka: well I have a power drill with an abrasive scrubby bit at the end
[22:33:17] <emmeka> by abrasive scrubby bit do you mean just like steel wool or a fuckin grinder
[22:33:34] <ButterNoodle> *not an sos pad with detergent
[22:33:50] <emmeka> plain steel wool would be best. no SOS pads, yeah.

[22:34:21] <emmeka> ButterNoodle I wish they'd bring back home ec so I don't have to teach people how to housewife on the internet all the time
[22:34:45] <emmeka> how does one go through life not knowing how to use a cast iron pan :(
[22:35:00] <emmeka> MootPoot yeah that'll do
[22:35:09] <MootPoot> although now my family has a - dont touch any of MootPoot's kitchen stuff rule
[22:35:20] <MootPoot> so i guess it wont happen anymore - methinks
[22:35:25] <MootPoot> probably
[22:35:26] <MootPoot> not
[22:35:31] <MootPoot> ( it will )
[22:35:40] <emmeka> MootPoot so buff that fucker good, then you have to season it *many* times
[22:35:47] <emmeka> do you know how to season
[22:36:02] <MootPoot> I did try that a while ago - drill brush it and season it for 3  cycles
[22:36:16] <MootPoot> it didn't really work
[22:37:02] <emmeka> you're using grapeseed oil so it's hard to fuck up, but coat every inch of that steel in liberal amounts of oil (enough that there's some standing in the pan) and then bake as hot as you can go below smoke point for a long ass time. Then, take it out, cool it. Then wipe it down. Then do it again. And again. And again.
[22:37:15] <emmeka> I think you could bake at 400¬∞F
[22:37:18] <MootPoot> how many times do I have to loop this method
[22:37:35] <emmeka> until it looks greasy, black, and sexy
[22:37:58] <emmeka> it should have a sheen to the thing
[22:38:07] <MootPoot> ok
[22:38:10] <MootPoot> I shall do that
[22:38:17] <emmeka> but first, clean it good
[22:38:38] <emmeka> won't do you any good if it's got soap in the pores where you want oil to be

[23:43:09] <isekaijin> I don't think you can rank them linearly.
[23:43:15] <isekaijin> It depends on the user's knowledge and expectations.
[23:43:17] <Bco1981> there is something worse then gentoo ?
[23:43:31] <love_> what's more challenging than gentoo
[23:43:57] <Sapphirus> Linux from scratch is probably the hardest.
[23:44:06] <love_> let's assume the user is an average user
[23:44:11] <isekaijin> Mmm... Alpine Linux is not a distro for normal desktop usage, but if you tried to use it that way, then I guess it would be harder than Gentoo.
