[16:49:05] <rwb> i mean i think the limit is doing its job but not in the way that the documentation expects it to
[16:49:32] <rwb> i.e. instead of killing the container when it hits over the limit, it simply stops

[17:10:52] <rwb> https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2022/03/20/please-put-units-in-names interesting article, i would probably do this like: std os sleep: 300 seconds.
[17:10:53] <mockturtle> [ Please put units in names ] - ruudvanasseldonk.com
[17:11:19] <rwb> std traits integer seconds would return a std duration copySeconds: self.
[17:11:40] <rwb> which would probably use nanoseconds internally, or something
[17:12:20] <rwb> and then all std os sleep: has to do is do something like sleep: duration = (_Nanosleep: duration asNanoseconds).
[17:14:29] <rwb> bonus is that duration doesn't have to be a std duration, anything that accepts the asNanoseconds message and returns an integer would be ok there. yay behaviorism
[17:14:30] <wink> ha, I ran into this only a month ago
[17:14:46] <wink> the api exposes microseconds and I expected milliseconds
[17:18:01] <rwb> oop got disconnected
[17:18:17] <rwb> hmm i wonder how something like "give me all the objects that accept a certain message" would work... perhaps it could be something like "only objects that are not clones (creator path == object && isComplete)" too
[17:18:34] <rwb> so you could type "asNanoseconds" and it would return "std duration" which is complete and is the prototype

[17:37:15] <rwb> yeah data oriented design could be... interesting, to place in a pure object oriented system

[17:38:10] <wink> or a calendar entry
[17:38:21] <rwb> sure
[17:38:41] <rwb> the object need only respond to that specific message, i want to present that information to the user
[17:38:42] <wink> I dont see how this would be uniformly applicable to.. not even random, but just nort 100% related, objects

[22:19:04] <q3k> and i didn't investiate this because this wouldn't work with code emitted for lanai11 by llvm, as that was designed to use all registers already - so i had no use for this whole functionality
[22:19:40] <q3k> that's about all i've written up about the llvm/rust stuff so far, i'll write up more if you're interested :)
[22:20:52] <q3k> it was honestly quite... boring, things just worked, the rustc porting was basically following the embedded nomicon and adding bits for lanai as i went along, the llvm stuff was reading a bunch of C++ until things made sense... writing an lld implementation was criminally trivial, it's a fantastic codebase.

[22:51:16] <amazigh> q3k: is it easy to generate LLVM IR from high level programming language?
[22:51:28] <amazigh> shooting in the dark with that question.
[22:52:23] <q3k> depending on the language, there's a lot of “baby's first llvm targeting language” projects out there
[22:52:27] *** Joins: ngp (~ngp@199.180.249.183)
[22:52:51] <q3k> it's about as difficult as generally writing a language parser/lexer/frontend/first-stage-compiler
[22:53:20] <q3k> the llvm ir you should emit is an SSA, so if you can emit SSA, it shouldn't be too difficult :)
[22:53:31] <amazigh> ok
[22:53:48] <amazigh> it is true that llvm can target wasm?
[22:53:59] <q3k> yes
[22:54:02] <q3k> and ebpf, too
[22:54:23] <amazigh> just chatting, I am not even sure I will come to build that thing
[22:54:36] <q3k> whatever you wanna try to build, do it ^^
[22:54:57] <q3k> anyway i'm no compiler/llvm expert, i mostly just fixed a few bugs here and there
[22:55:30] <amazigh> the current stage I am at, is that I have is an interpreter hosted on Chez Scheme. Chez Scheme has its own assembly IR, but it does not support many CPU architectures
[22:56:33] <amazigh> Many argue for targeting directly assembly from say Scheme, but ignoring llvm seems... a more difficult endeveor
[22:57:36] <q3k> using llvm also has its tradeoffs
[22:57:58] <q3k> it's a big C++ codebase, so if you're trying to make a fully self hosting-language, using llvm will pretty much prevent you from doing that
[22:58:56] <q3k> (i respect Go's decision to make their own compiler backends, for example - it's such an amazing language to cross-compile with thanks to that)
[23:00:02] <amazigh> possibly, it is a very niche target language, I mostly would like more people poking at it, I guess targeting wasm or javascript will make it easier for people to experiment with it
[23:00:20] <amazigh> (and I do not have Go human force)
[23:01:01] <cot> You could use a tinier compiler backend, like qbe
[23:01:22] <amazigh> I am / used to be into the "web is evil" kind of karma... so...
[23:01:42] <cot> But that has big tradeoffs as well -- qbe is pretty undeveloped and has only two backends (though there's a project that's developing more backends, but it's not prod-ready)
[23:01:56] <cot> Plus it's a big C codebase so ...
[23:02:48] <cot> amazigh: compile it to CHIP-8 :^)
[23:03:54] <q3k> compile it to lanai, then use llvm's c backend, then use emscripten to get js
[23:04:05] <q3k> the compiler turducken must grow
[23:05:59] <amazigh> cot: I consider also that kind of targets :)
[23:06:01] <Church> heh
[23:06:36] <cot> :)
[23:07:11] <amazigh> hey I read that python 3.11 will support compilation to wasm via emscripten
[23:07:29] <amazigh> without patches
[23:09:03] <amazigh> like peter hintjens told me a long time ago: ideas are cheap. I start to understand what he meant.

[23:11:38] <amazigh> I have many ideas but I do not know which one to pursue :|
[23:12:02] <gwozniak> Not sure I like it when I get a bug report about debug info in the compiler and find out the working case only works because of luck
[23:12:28] <Church> Well that's not great heh
[23:12:32] <Church> Define luck?
[23:12:34] <amazigh> When I was young on foolish I could code poorly whatever can to my mind. Nowadays, it is more like analysis paralysis.
[23:12:42] <gwozniak> On the other hand, the original bug report isn't as bad as it's made out to be! :)
[23:13:05] <gwozniak> Church: the order of the compilation units in the .debug_info section
[23:14:29] <gwozniak> amazigh: yup, ideas are very cheap :)

[23:25:45] <epilys> it's easy but it requires some code to setup your own logic

[23:26:34] <river> this is fundamentally wrong
