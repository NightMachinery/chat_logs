[04:03:12] <cis> when the human species masters genomics, we're going to be making superintelligent cats, and that's going to be a real problem, because they will not treat us as well as we treat them.

[04:03:54] <cis> truly the ultimate in cuckoo-based game theory
[04:04:17] <ircuser> arahael yea ill read it again. I mean I get that we need to encode "symbols" (ill accept that this is vague for now) as numbers at some point to represent them on a computer (obviously). however, why would they need to be ordered?
[04:04:52] <ircuser> symbols aren't inherently ordered
[04:05:26] <Twix> the short answer: people made a list. This list defines the order.

[06:00:18] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Just be aware that part of the interview isn't really just getting the right code.  Perhaps more important is how you explain that code and how you respond to any improvements that are suggested, etc.
[06:00:33] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[06:00:37] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Ie, the interviewer is frequently looking at how you *interact* with other humans.
[06:00:39] <[itchyjunk]> How do you mean improvements?
[06:00:46] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see
[06:01:09] <[itchyjunk]> I would explaining by saying there is 4 possible condition so i would want to use conditional blocks
[06:01:31] <[itchyjunk]> but i want to iterate those conditions over the natural numbers so i would want a block that loops
[06:01:41] <[itchyjunk]> rest is just language detail right?

[06:02:38] <d3x0r> make a input listof divisors to test so it's confiurable instead of constants
[06:02:40] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see
[06:02:57] <[itchyjunk]> d3x0r, ah right, those types of things would be possible

[10:06:42] <psydroid> it will grow over the next few years, but very organically
[10:06:50] <pikapika> Its a simple matter really. Apple prices its shit so its unsuable in 90% countries of the world.
[10:07:11] <nekodesu> i have a macbook, please dont get one, they are terrible
[10:07:15] <pikapika> So apple is popular in a few countries with a strong currency
[10:07:22] <pikapika> mainly america, and less europeans
[10:07:25] <pikapika> and thats it
[10:07:27] <pikapika> And thats fine
[10:07:42] <pikapika> Because thats the market they are targeting
[10:07:44] <psydroid> however there are Chromebooks and Android devices competing with Linux distributions
[10:07:53] <novns> if you try to create music - you have to use macos or windows, linux software is just an useless toy
[10:08:25] <pikapika> Doubt it

[10:08:58] <novns> pikapika, they play with creating music, and never do a job
[10:09:15] <novns> because you need hardware, and drivers are not available
[10:09:16] <pikapika> I am sure there are some linux using studios and labels too
[10:09:21] <nekodesu> linux is only good as a server os and only used by unemployed neets
[10:09:28] <pikapika> What hardware? Guitars are not linux specific
[10:09:41] <novns> you need good VST plugins, and they are not available
[10:09:51] <novns> pikapika, audio interfaces
[10:10:20] <pikapika> Okay. That matters for studios that heavily use vst. In death metal, it is mainly physical pedals and effects in use.
[10:10:24] <pikapika> so the software matters much less
[10:10:27] <novns> I have a delta 1010lt, and it works poorly in linux

[10:10:43] <novns> and focusrite scarletts are pain too
[10:10:52] <pikapika> They just record onto a fourtrack and release it as it is
[10:10:53] <nekodesu> again, with windows 11 shitting on people's hardware, more things moving to the web. all we can keep doing is pray that adobe and shit will actually DO something. valve is putting a large effort lately, adobe and stuff can too

[10:11:37] <nekodesu> me neither, im just saying
[10:12:07] <novns> pikapika, studios with real gear are expensive, bands cannot pay $1000 per hour to record things

[12:17:32] <deniska> euouae: but basically you load a file into a string, exec it using a particular namespace, and now through that namespace object you can call user defined functions

[15:11:56] <arahael> no_gravity: That's not neccessarily a problem.  What if say, they needed to use an RTL marker in the colour, but you've stripped that out, and users then go: "What's this garbage colour?"
[15:12:26] <arahael> no_gravity: Maybe you could provide a merge or rename colours facility?
[15:13:56] <no_gravity> arahael: I see rtl markers often. And so far they always were wrongly used. No user so far really wanted to use a rtl string. But many have managed to copy+past rtl markers for some reason.
[15:16:09] <arahael> no_gravity: Perhaps compare it with all the other colours you have, and if, after stripping all such codes, you determine that they're equivalent, ask: "Did you mean to use this colour or to create a new one?"
[15:16:23] <arahael> Or something.
[15:17:59] <no_gravity> arahael: Ok. If the "strip all control chars" ever causes a problem, I will consider that.

[22:28:34] <mrig> People used to distinguish a procedure from a function.
[22:28:50] <[itchyjunk]> ah used to :P now they are the same?
[22:28:55] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: state is some kind of information that exists over a period of time and mutates over a period of time. Variables are state. 
[22:29:08] <mrig> seems quite nice to make the comparison mentally to see the distinction.
[22:29:17] <[itchyjunk]> ah, constants are not state then
[22:29:36] <pyzozord> mrig: I'm actually not familiar of the difference between procedure and function. Is is that one is statefull and other stateless?
[22:29:51] <pyzozord> I know that some languages call object funtions "methods"
[22:30:09] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: correct, constants are not state
[22:30:16] <edgar-rft> If the world were purely functional the United States were the United Values.
[22:31:02] <[itchyjunk]> java calls them methods right?
[22:31:23] <[itchyjunk]> i guess java doesn't have `functions`
[22:31:44] <[itchyjunk]> since they always appear in classes and are meant to manupulate the object in some way
[22:32:02] <CodeMouse92> [itchyjunk]: Member function = method. Yes. That's pretty common terminology.
[22:34:21] <edgar-rft> [itchyjunk]: it's best to use what the respective language specs calls them (procedures, functions, methods), otherwise you will end up in endless fundamentalistic language design discussions :-)

[22:37:45] <mrig> a math function is always perfectly reversible, and changes nothing, a procedure erases data or mutates it. The guide that he gives is that few functions are stateless, but the key point is that if the state that is changing is local to the method, then there are no unexpected changes else where.
[22:38:56] <[itchyjunk]> Huh, how to you mean reversible?
[22:39:00] <mrig> obviously this is not possible when your soul purpose is to mutate data, but the key is that it is a nice way to structure your code so that it is modular.
[22:39:02] <[itchyjunk]> Not all functions are bijective
[22:39:18] <mrig> then those functions alter state.
[22:39:59] <mrig> and you are in a state machine :)

[22:43:35] <mrig> cis: I would consider a hash function to be generating a new object rather than modifying one, however as it is generating data it would be a procedure rather more so than a function given the logical axioms proposed by Bertrand Meyer in his example.

[22:44:25] <mrig> more so than that of mathmatics.

[23:57:20] <jeaye> State machines are so common, with such common feature sets, that they can be generalized. So using a library to make your state machine can make sense if you want want to bother with the tedium of building a state machine and instead focus on the app you're trying to build.
