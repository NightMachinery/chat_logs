[02:59:03] <dadinn> I am trying to use debootstrap to bootstrap Debian 10/11 locally, but I would also like to use a local apt-mirror. The problem I am facing is when the rood directory is finished bootstrapping, I can see that the the /etc/apt/sources.list file is 0 bytes, empty. Why is this happening? When I am using a network mirror, it is populated with the expected defaults.
[03:00:30] <somiaj> dadinn: may have to dig into the script a bit more, but can't you just update the sources.list anyways?

[03:10:43] <somiaj> my guess is the script just doesn't see your mirror as valid and thus isn't creating a sources.list for it. You are probably best off just creating the sources.list after the effect. You could add a script to do this easy enough.
[03:11:42] <dadinn> I've actually just echoed the deb line with file:///var/... into the zero byte sources.list and it seems to work fine with it!

[15:17:51] <Khepra> the oposite of what you did to pin is a smug reply, but one hinting at importance of knowing what you're doing when you bork things liek this.
[15:18:10] <Eryn_FL> i honestly dont remember doing it Khepra

[15:26:48] <Khepra> I suppose it has some value when you're running sid and want to be careful about new bugs; and running sid means you're in perpetual state of having a broken system, even though it's not immediately visible :))   but jokes aside... you have bullseye in your repos. that's a big no-no to tip-toe around package versions with custom repos, like this, in Stable

[19:04:38] <Haohmaru> wayland is something like a new alternative to whatever the old thing was.. "X"
[19:05:09] <Haohmaru> so, LXDE is one DE that certainly doesn't use wayland (yet?)
[19:05:12] <Haohmaru> xfce i think too
[19:05:33] <Haohmaru> gnome uses wayland since before, kde probably too

[19:06:50] <_ganapathi_> on dmesg or syslog
[19:07:56] <_ganapathi_> i can able to see x11 and xwayland related packages on installed package list. i don't know which one using it
[19:08:49] <Haohmaru> what's the name of the program?
[19:09:13] <_ganapathi_> anydesk, zoom, webex, microsoft teams

[19:09:52] <_ganapathi_> zoom have one side audio problem.
[19:10:06] <zaggynl> I'm not too familar with Gnome but there should be a login screen option to switch between Wayland and Xorg/X Windows manager
[19:10:26] <_ganapathi_> ooh. then i will search it in that way
[19:10:44] <Haohmaru> okay then, so _ganapathi_ log out of gnome, and from the login manager you have to look for that option

[22:59:06] <Khepra> !deb.sury.org
[22:59:06] <dpkg> PHP Packages with different versions than stable are available from deb.sury.org, provided by the same developer who maintains PHP for debian stable. Not supported in #debian, but should be about as reliable as <backports>. Short instructions can be found at https://packages.sury.org/php/README.txt . See <mod-php>.
