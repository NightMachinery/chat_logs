[00:28:32] <ThePendulum> damn how did I miss spacex is launching civilians into orbit in a couple hours https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pv01sSq44w
[00:29:53] <ThePendulum> don't remember anyone mentioning they were planning to shatter the cute little attempts from Branson and Bezos
[00:30:33] <sarnold> is this just going to be crewed dragon floating around for three days, no stopover at iss?
[00:31:26] <ThePendulum> apparently
[00:32:35] <ThePendulum> pretty insane they're doing this on top of a rocket that was used twice already
[00:33:18] <ThePendulum> apparently one of the astronaut's call signs is Hanks
[00:33:33] <ThePendulum> every time Tom Hanks takes something up in the air it doesn't end well
[00:35:49] <sarnold> haha
[00:39:44] <NeoThermic> ThePendulum, almost any transport actually, he was a terrible ship captain; I guess as a conductor he wasn't responsible for the driving, but even that had some.. interesting non-train moments :P

[00:42:35] <ThePendulum> true
[00:43:27] <ThePendulum> NeoThermic: you had that lego town right? trying to find a good way to clean full models, online they mainly talk about the bricks, don't really want to take the whole thing apart
[00:43:47] <ThePendulum> thinking of putting it in front of a big screen and using my mini air compressor
[00:43:56] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_​O< Q​UACK!
[00:43:58] <ThePendulum> ,bang
[00:43:59] <unfinity> ThePendulum you shot a duck in 2.061 seconds! You have killed 171 ducks in #datahoarder.
[00:44:17] <ThePendulum> I want to make a plan to bring my 3d printer back to life, and it's currently being occupied by my lego moon lander, mainly printing dust :/

[00:45:07] <NeoThermic> ThePendulum, depends on what kind of models they are
[00:45:51] <NeoThermic> the town is easy to clean, I just remove each floor and dust it as per any standard kind of dusting, the ground floors get a bit of compressed air after I've removed the minifigs. The roads get wiped down
[00:46:28] <NeoThermic> getting one of those electric air compressor cleaning things is useful, but ensure you try find one with a speed adjustment, as full-blast can be a bit.. brick removing :D
[00:46:31] <ThePendulum> I've got a saturn v that's relatively easy to wipe off, then a porsche that is fairly sturdy and mainly has annoying corners, then the moon lander that is both intricate and annoyingly shaped, and now a typewriter that is fairly sturdy but basically has a hole straight into all the mechanics of it, so really annoying, lol
[00:47:14] *** Joins: sumthing1980 (~sumthing1@94.54.64.154)
[00:47:24] <ThePendulum> ah right, yeah I have a datavac which just has a button, I could maybe hack a speed controller onto it
[00:47:27] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@116-255-6-75.ip4.superloop.com)
[00:47:44] <NeoThermic> eh, if it has one speed, use a flow reduction valve outlet
[00:48:06] <ThePendulum> it does have a few attachments like that, might be worth a try. I figured I could put a big sheet behind it as well and just catch the lego pieces that fly off
[00:48:16] <ThePendulum> if it can fly off easy it can probably also be put back easily
[00:48:21] <NeoThermic> yeah, also remove any that you can tell will be removed :D
[00:48:45] <NeoThermic> most intricate thing so far to de-dust is anything with sails
[00:50:16] <ThePendulum> ah, like fabric sails that dust sticks to or what makes it difficult?
[00:50:49] <NeoThermic> yeah, they catch dust, but you can't just clean them in-situ
[00:51:06] <NeoThermic> like, throwing an air duster at a sail is a great way to pull the masts down :D
[00:51:27] <ThePendulum> pfft how they gonna survive at sea
[00:51:53] <NeoThermic> "Note: Model does not float" :D
[00:53:20] <ThePendulum> the datavac should be useful for my 3d printer as well, bit put off by all the messed up wiring and alignments
[00:53:29] <ThePendulum> and one of the stop switches broke off

[01:00:19] <ThePendulum> ugh wanted to get my sister an aquapaw shower thing for her dog, but they won't ship in time for her birthday. always so difficult no one ever knows what they want
[01:06:48] <NeoThermic> ThePendulum, buy it, and put the receipt/shipping info in a box
[01:07:24] <NeoThermic> "it's on the way and delayed, but I got you something you wanted" is better than "eh, CBF, here's an amazon voucher" (unless you've already agreed the latter is fine)
[01:08:22] <NeoThermic> it's possibly the last year you get to blame this shit on a global pandemic :D
