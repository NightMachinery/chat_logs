[01:23:05] <drmpeg> Should be okay. I can't explain the errors you're seeing.
[01:30:27] <drmpeg> sleep_for is nothing new. It's been around since c++11.
[01:32:12] <drmpeg> It's not a boost thing. The compiler is just telling you that boost::this_thread::sleep_for would be an alternative.
[01:33:09] <muaddib[m]> <funkylab[m]> "there's libvrt. yootis  might..." <- Thanks! libvrt seems to be the way to go. 
[01:54:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> I wrote a "data pump" applicaton that used libvrt--for a company that makes commercial Ku/Ka LNBs and was considering entering the "fiber-to-the-dish" market.  Because apparently some part of the satellite industry is going that way.
[01:55:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> I think he was dismayed to discover how much compu-crunch is needed even to just be a data-pump/converter for a single transponder (40MHz).

[02:09:52] <BarryDuggan[m]> I think I'll give up on 21.10. I have a dual boot with 21.04 (which is what I'm on now)
[02:12:46] <drmpeg> I got a little burned with 21.10 on RISC-V. For some unknown reason making kernel .debs takes much much longer. From a few minutes on 21.04 to an hour on 21.10.
[02:15:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> I’m on 21.10 on x86 with all packaged stuff. I’m happy in that I can point my user base in that direction and be reasonably confident they’ll succeed.
[02:17:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> When I only had a small number of apps (1 or 2), and a small number of users, I could "stomach" holding their hands through source builds.  But I'm a grumpy old man now....
[02:18:43] <drmpeg> RISC-V is still very much experimental. 21.10 doesn't have Firefox or Chrome.
[02:20:56] <drmpeg> There's some hideous gnome browser that's slower than cold snot on a doorknob.
[02:21:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> "slower than cold snot on a doorknob".  I think that's better than "compu-crunch" :)
[02:23:14] <drmpeg> I think that may be a Maine expression. That's where grandma has to keep her false teeth in anti-freeze at night.
[02:24:48] <drmpeg> Although my high school friends that still live there tell me it's a lot milder now than when we were kids.
[02:25:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: I live in Eastern, Ontario, Canada.  I understand cold. :)
[02:25:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> So what is your RISC-V platform, and how is the compu-crunch/$ ?
[02:27:48] <drmpeg> It's a development platform from SiFive. At $650, the compu-crunch/$ is not good. A Rpi4 is faster.
[02:28:16] <drmpeg> https://www.crowdsupply.com/sifive/hifive-unmatched
[02:29:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> Roger that.  I'm always looking for SBCs for ccera.ca that have high compu-crunch/$.  I was an Odroid XU4 fan for quite a while, but they're harder to get, and I find a need a little bit more crunch/board these days.
[02:29:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> Mini-pcs with J4125s are a kind of good deal when on sale, etc.
[02:30:47] <drmpeg> The RISC-V board was just something to fool around with and see what was going in in that space.

[05:40:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> For testing, I set a high threshold so that it's never actually going to write anything.  The idea is to see how much bandwidth it can swallow before putting out significant number of 'O'.  The occasionaly 'O' isn't a big deal, since the things it's looking for are quite rare, so it's unlikely to "miss" one during the occasional overrun.

[06:28:11] <muaddib[m]> As far as antenna I have a bunch of rubber duckies for different bands, 2 RF Space vivaldi’s (350MHz to 12GHz) and an RF space wideband LP. I also have a LANA LNA that’s decent. 
[06:28:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> Doesn't matter.  Just a performance test.  In real life you'd need a dish antenna and an LNA.
[06:29:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> I've been testing with a B205mini @ 20Msps
[06:30:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> "Real" FRB processing chains are waaay more compute-spendy than this.  But this particular implementation is useful for a small corner of the parameter space of FRBs.
[06:34:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> An if you're lucky, you might detect one FRB a month with a pair of 3m dishes pointed in different directions (for anti-correlation)
[06:35:55] <muaddib[m]> Is this the same FRB you’re talking about?
[06:35:58] <muaddib[m]> https://astronomy.com/news/2020/11/astronomers-have-finally-found-the-cause-of-mysterious-fast-radio-bursts
[06:36:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> IF you have two dishes pointed in different directions and they both see the same event at the same time, then it's "local".  If not, then it's more likely to be "out there".  The internal filtering takes care of some of the analysis.   Ideal is to have two dishes far enough apart but pointing at the same palce in teh sky at the same time.
[06:36:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: Yes, that's one class of FRBs.  
[06:39:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> There was a project called STARE2 that detected a *bright* FRB near the edge of our galaxy, likely from a magnetar, at 21cm.  Using a horn antenna and a ground screen.  They had three sites and by using TOA were able to determine the DOA and confirm the object.  What that means is that there are classes of FRBs that are bright enough for collections of small dishes, operating at smaller bandwidths, with "stupider" processing chains.
[06:40:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> By next year, we'll have 6 fixed-pointing antennas and 1 or two movable ones all looking for FRBs.

[07:44:38] <patchvonbraun[m]> Expression-handling changes between GR 3.8 and 3.9 perhaps?  skyf is either set to the hardware frequency, or the "sky" frequency, depending the setting of "sky".  Pretty ordinary Python conditional expression.

[07:53:26] <muaddib[m]> but the hw is def pushing it. 
[07:53:26] <muaddib[m]> are you using an SBC with better performance? I'm interested in other options.
[07:53:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> At some point, I might re-code the actual analysis block in C++ as an OOT, but it's only being fed at 2Ksps.
[07:54:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> I'm running it at 20Msps on a J4205 system--very similar to what you have I think--a "mini pc" BeeLink T45.

[14:44:35] <funkylab[m]> mcan06 you're mixing a UHD 4.1.0 with an uhd 3.15.0 and an uhd 3.10.3 installation
[14:45:12] <funkylab[m]> I wasn't even aware you can install all these three at once! It's, however, a bad idea. 
[14:46:20] <funkylab[m]> I'd strongly recommend uninstalling all three and then only installing the one you need. Since this is a GNU radio channel, you probably want the one your GNU Radio comes with, so don't manually install a UHD at all
[14:47:01] <funkylab[m]> Just remove all the uhd packages and afterwards reinstall gnuradio
[14:47:21] <funkylab[m]> Unless you have a good reason not to use that

[15:32:56] <BarryDuggan[m]> that fixed it 🙂
[15:33:44] <drmpeg> Probably should be a fatal CMake error. Almost everything is disabled without it.

[15:40:06] <BarryDuggan[m]> with pip?
[15:40:59] <drmpeg> Yes. At least for pygccxml. I don't bother with pyqtgraph.
[15:45:35] <drmpeg> pyqtgraph is only used for the filter design tool. So it doesn't affect the build or make test.

[18:19:29] <geraman21[m]> Hello guys, Does anybody have a good source to read about the origin of the complex signal I get from an RF front-end ? From what I understand, front-end down-converts the signal from IF to baseband, but I fail to find how exactly it is done.
[18:26:12] <BarryDuggan[m]> AdaBull: the https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Constellation_Receiver may be the best approach
[18:26:12] <BarryDuggan[m]> I'm not sure the Costas loop would work

[22:32:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> geraman21: That depends VERY much on the hardware in question.  
[22:32:30] *** Joins: DiffieHellman (~Username@user/curve25519chacha)
[22:39:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> For example,with RTL-SDR  the R820T2 is a low-IF tuner, that produces a REAL IF at about 3MHz (AFAIR), the RTL-2832U chip then applies a transform on that to produce basebanded I/Q signals coming out the USB.  But the RTL-2832U chip can also interface to complex-baseband (I/Q) tuners, like the E4000.  In that case, it doesn't bother doing a basebanding transform.
[22:40:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> I don't recall whether on the RTL it's a digital or analog transform inside the chip.
