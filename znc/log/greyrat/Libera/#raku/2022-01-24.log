[22:17:50] <leont> andinus: generally speaking, you do not want to do that. Any relative URL in such a page will point to a different location depending on the presence of the slash or not
[22:18:27] <[Coke]> might be better to have a redirect.
[22:18:38] <leont> Exactly, that's generally the better idea.
[22:18:45] <[Coke]> then the final page will act consistently for relative urls
[22:18:51] <[Coke]> leont++
[22:19:17] <leont> I'd personally make the slashless version canonical, but that's entirely personal taste. Either option is fine, just be consistent
[22:19:58] <leont> Another problem with aliasing them is that it's cache unfriendly
[22:20:48] <leont> Because as far as caches are concerned, they're different URLs
[22:21:38] <andinus> ugexe: i see, ya that would work
[22:21:56] <andinus> Voldenet: iasked it in #cro, - the middleware solution -  https://paste.debian.net/hidden/ff0cb0f2/
[22:23:02] <andinus> leont: i see, that makes sense, i'll setup a redirect then

[22:37:54] <SmokeMachine> I was wondering… would that be possible/make sense to @ sigiled arguments of functions become Tuple?
[22:42:31] <[Coke]> I don't think you can change what the default @ means.
[22:42:44] <[Coke]> You could specifically type things Tuple if you wanted.
[22:46:20] <leont> Is there a less annoying way to turn a number into a bigendian encoded Buf than «my $b = Buf.new; $b.write-uint16(0, 1234, BigEndian);»
[22:46:39] <leont> It seems like that shouldn't take two statement
[22:47:43] <[Coke]> ... Buf.new.writ....
[22:47:55] <[Coke]> which isn't helpful, but is one statement. :)
[22:48:14] <leont> write-* return Nil, so it's useless
[22:48:41] <[Coke]> I don't think there's a shorter way, no
[22:59:41] <SmokeMachine> We can change what’s the default smile… shouldn’t we be able to change the default class for a sigil? Making Tuple the default for @ on function args would make simple to people understanding this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70779446/why-are-arrays-passed-as-arguments-mutable-but-scalars-are-not
[23:01:46] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: there have been several problem solving issues about that already
[23:02:10] <lizmat> Personally, I think we need to revisit the whole picture for either 6.e  or 6.f

[23:08:56] <SmokeMachine> Agree… but if we are adding an “immutable list” in core, that would be a great chance “fix the inconsistency”

[23:36:58] <thundergnat> I stumbled across (typoed actually,) a bit of syntax I never saw before and was more than a little surprised it gave the answer I was looking for.
[23:37:04] <thundergnat> m: for 1..5 { say .$ }
[23:37:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ee3a46e3: OUTPUT: «1␤2␤3␤4␤5␤»
[23:37:27] <thundergnat> I don't believe I have ever seen .$ as an alias for $_ before.
[23:38:19] <thundergnat> I assume I shouldn't rely on it... Or have I just been blind and never noticed before that was legal?

[23:45:35] <thundergnat> Kind of a weird Easter egg rather than legal syntax I guess.
