[00:40:04] <gorgonical> The point of the irq domains is to provide a mapping from hwirq to linux irq. You write the controller and set your handler using set_irq_handler() (sic?). That handler is supposed to figure out the hwirq by polling some hardware, whatever. Then you call the domain irq handler, which then uses the high-level API
[00:40:19] <gorgonical> Which uses your domain_ops to translate the hwirq number to a linux irq number?

[07:27:00] <peetaur> you want just port 443, not also every other thing root can do
[07:27:17] <peetaur> so eg. sysctl to change that limit from 1024 to 443, then start it, then change back  would be superior

[07:27:40] <ayecee> CAP_NETADMIN, maybe.
[07:27:49] <peetaur> but the proper way is for the service to run as root, then within its own code, drop privileges (that's how eg. apache2 does it)
[07:27:51] <sebastorama> simply because.. someone finds a vulnerability in this hugo server thing
[07:28:02] <sebastorama> that can execute arbitrary code
[07:28:02] <peetaur> there might be a --user or such option to do that

[07:29:47] <ayecee> security is a balance. you can spend a lot of time locking things down in finer and finer-grained ways, but at some point the additional security it gets you falls short of the extra administrative overhead it costs you.
[07:30:08] <peetaur> yes but a simple hack like sysctl is way better than running some weird service as root
[07:30:14] *** wigums is now known as CaptBeetusMan
[07:30:30] <sebastorama> running services as a regular user is not really an overhead

[07:30:58] <Yonle> By the way i'll switch to sysvinit back, but who knows

[08:32:50] <lockywolf> although many years without a release certainly decrease people's desire to write slackbuilds

[08:39:50] <chance2105> remyabel: Apt has a feature, autoremove, where if you remove packages you told apt to install (so they're marked as manually installed) .. it looks to see that you can remove packages based on what you want to install

[08:40:56] <AssKoala> NTFS support is extremely important

[08:41:12] <jbm> AssKoala, exfat is more important, and it got the full-write/safe support from samsung/ms
[08:41:27] <jbm> AssKoala, it is rock stable (don't use it below 5.10)
[08:41:30] <AssKoala> yep, Im glad MS gave up patent protection for that
[08:41:31] <chance2105> It only sometimes works out that way, and has an increasing change of not actually reversing what apt did earlier, the bigger the dependency chain is
[08:41:34] <AssKoala> works great

[08:41:45] <jbm> AssKoala, actually an MS-rep gave the o.k for it (lkml :)
[08:41:56] <jbm> AssKoala, it's old news, it was like 2 years ago...
[08:41:58] <AssKoala> chance2105, I havent run into issues with it, but I know that there are definite issues between manually adding something and auto installing
[08:42:21] <jbm> AssKoala, they originally renamed their exfat project so it wouldn't conflict with the already existing exfat project in fuse-land
[08:42:21] <AssKoala> if you accidentally make a package manually installed, the depency backtracing breaks
[08:42:22] <chance2105> Gentoo portage .. this is one area where it does that right. It will freaking remove packages that aren't required, ruthlessly.
[08:42:29] <AssKoala> I mean, its not broken it just doesnt do what you wnat

Opening it in `less` or something shows that it's very much a binary file that (I'm guessing) is built as part of `make`ing the program - if I have a cross-compiler working and set it with `./configure --host=[whatever]`, does that... work? LFS indicates
[10:17:41] <AssKoala> I mean, I also have a ps4, ps5, xb1og, xb1x devkit as well
[10:17:41] <c-x-berger> that it's just copied from the host system, which has me worrying that it's architecture specific...

[10:22:54] <jbm> c-x-berger, the file command looks at the beginning bytes of a file and see if it matches some signature to give a wild guess to the type of data is contained
[10:23:24] <jbm> c-x-berger, that's sounds right -- but what is it about file/magic here... looks odd a question for something complex  as cross-compiling

[10:28:03] <mlu> LFS is that: so you realyl wanted to use gentoo
[10:28:47] <mlu> but it's in that uncanny area of having so much instruction that you're probably not gonna understand it anyways
[10:29:07] <c-x-berger> so according to file(1) itself, there's a _bit_ of arch-specific stuff going on, since it notes the endian-ness of the file

[10:29:52] <jbm> c-x-berger, you can get the hang of pretty much the fact that all linux distros use "coreutils" -- and if you master your way around "apropos", "man _x_command" and figure out how to list files with your package manager, you'll be appreciate stuff of the like-->https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Rosetta
[10:30:19] <AssKoala> why is endianness a conversation piece? its literally irrelevant for most all things
[10:30:22] <jbm> c-x-berger, is a nice reference for any major distribution (even though it is on the archwiki) -- is applicable to many great things to discover :P
[10:30:45] <c-x-berger> the chip is whatever Ebon Upton and his friends at RPi trading put in the rpi4 :P
[10:31:01] <mlu> Asskoala: the times where it's relevant, it takes over everything

[14:06:32] <TJ-> Daulity: 'via' gives the address of the gateway router on the other end of that link. For point-to-point links like PPP usually it, it isn't so much of an issue but when evaluating which routes that are otherwise equal the kernel will always choose the most specific
[14:06:37] <kish`> is dd-wrt or openwrp 'better' ?
[14:06:51] <kish`> eh openwrt*

[14:08:04] <TJ-> kish`: that's an open-ended question; "it depends" on your criteria
[14:08:09] <PaulFertser> kish`: OpenWrt is a full distro following upstream projects closely. ddwrt is basically a bunch of vendor SDKs glued together with a somewhat unified web interface. Up to you to judge what's better.
[14:08:38] <kish`> hmm
[14:08:41] <kish`> what would you use?
[14:08:59] <PaulFertser> kish`: I would and I am using only OpenWrt.
[14:09:01] <Daulity> I am working on hardware that has both a mobile connection and a physical wired connection and the problem we are having is that if both the wired and the mobile connections are connected (wired gets it's setup from dhcp) then linux uses ppp0 and I want to make it so that if a wired connection is plugged in that that should be the default to be used for gaining access to the internet
[14:09:07] <TJ-> kish`: "it depends" on what the device is and what you intend it to do :)
[14:09:27] <kish`> TJ-, is there a scenario you can say one is better than the other?
[14:09:51] <TJ-> kish`: if one doesn't support a specific device and the other does
[14:10:39] <TJ-> Daulity: I thought so - and as I said the last time we talked about it, all you need to is set the metrics in the network management tool. What is being used to manage the network? What distro/release is it?
[14:10:54] <Daulity> the reason I want to make linux prefer a connection through the wired connection is because usually that is connected to a network where I can have access to it but if linux is connecting through ppp0 (the mobile connection) I do not have access to the board
[14:11:14] <TJ-> Daulity: in your case you'd set the metric on the wired route to be lower than the PPP

[15:02:13] <TJ-> peac: right, the tcpdump tells us the Pi is trying to find an IPv6 router on that link but nothing is responding. I'm going back to my original thought - broken/damaged cable! 2nd on my list is the switch-port on the ISP router isn't connected to the LAN bridge and is therefore isolated. Is there an alternate port that can be plugged into?
[15:02:56] <PaulFertser> I'd also try playing with fixing a different link speed with ethtool.
[15:03:04] <TJ-> peac: could you try connecting the Pi's Ethernet cable into a different port on the router - a port that you know another device works on? Then, if it fails, you know it's most likely a cable issue.
[15:03:16] <TJ-> PaulFertser: yes, good point.
[15:04:09] <TJ-> peac: also, you can check and potentially change the link speed with "sudo ethtool eth0"

[16:18:46] <tacokoneko> hello, I think I might be experiencing this https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/1241. Downgrading to Xorg 1.20 makes the problem stop. If my assumption is correct, could I go back to using xorg-server-git immediately by making sure I don't use fbdev or vesa? essentially, how do I switch from fbdev or vesa to something else? I'm not sure how to do that. I use amdgpu + mesa radeonsi with Xorg on RX 5700 XT

[19:35:21] <Skyraven> hi everyone, I'm hitting a brick wall with a curiosity and not finding too many hints on google. Linux router, for a couple of prefixes 4 paths with different weights. Is there any way to see the hashing result (which flow gets hashed on which link given those paths?)
[19:35:47] <TheGuestMovie> Gentpup: when I tried fetching an Amazon page, the response was "For automated Amazon access, please contact sales" or something. So you gotta use a scraper for pages with no API.

[20:14:40] <tahc> Arch is great. The community can go fry ice for all I care.
[20:14:43] <msiism> I mean, it's beginnig to becoem a running gag, but I'm gonna say it: Plan 9 rc, or its Unix port provides a better way to do a Unix shell. But it lacks so many things that it's not practical for me to use it.

[20:14:57] <Psi-Jack> I mean, if you prefer your garbage with your garbage, I suppose one could consider arch great.
[20:15:12] <gartt> Different ways to describe minimalism too; you could say Slackware is minimalist due to the package manager and lack of GUI tools and other bloat, yet to get a common working system, you need to install the whole shebang of packages, while ubuntu is bloated, but in terms of installation, you can start off with a small number of packages

[20:16:21] <TJ-> tahc: Ubuntu does! But they're focused on containerised workloads

[20:16:23] <bruda> Ubuntu did help bring Linux further into the mainstream. I'll give it that. But yea I moved away from those distro's years ago.
[20:16:27] <tahc> Yeah tusko, linux needs to be difficult for difficult sake because that's what pros do.

[20:18:03] <gartt> msiism: Sure, and I run it on my home server, but just saying that what's minimalist for one perspective might be the opposite for another. For example, gentoo can be installed as basically LFS plus portage, but some call portage a mess

[20:18:42] <msiism> tusko: Exactly, no "u". It's always "you" in here.

[20:36:16] <betterOne> TJ-: $1 == -h is also okay?

[20:40:03] <msiism> TL;DR: Do it manually, with a case statement in a while loop…
[20:40:04] <tahc> bruda, clean code might mean impure windows users are reading the holy text of bash scripts.

[20:41:17] <bruda> tahc hehe
[20:41:41] <tahc> There's a meme that has a degree of truth on it. If you want to know anything about linux, never directly ask the question, just say "Wow, linux can't do XYZ in [year]? What a joke" and be prepared for essay responses on you're wrong.

[20:42:05] <msiism> betterOne: You're welcome.
[20:42:38] <tirnanog> there is no chance of -a and -o ever polluting the [[ keyword. even posix considers it obsolete for [/test.

[23:01:40] <TJ-> FetidToot: well that's a first! glad you got it solved
[23:01:52] <tirnanog> arash: to understand it, you first have to back up for a moment and understand that -exec involves the direct execution of some other program. in the course of doing so, find also has the capability to provide argument(s) to whatever program it is executing.
[23:02:01] <webstrand> tirnanog: Oh! I'
[23:02:06] <webstrand> d missed the @Q
[23:02:08] <tirnanog> webstrand: ah

[23:14:23] <macaw> Hi everyone! Is there a more light-weight alternative to screen/tmux? I don't need most of screen's functionality and I dislike having to type through another "layer" (ssh, screen, irc client/other program) just to be able to keep a process alive when I disconnect from ssh and reattach to it when I'm back.
