[02:31:47] <buu_> I need some high cleverness

[02:34:02] <LeoNerd> Usually, whatever orchestration system you have to start those X independent programs can give them all index numbers, so they can pick themselves

[03:33:54] <xenu> sorry, i forgot to add a tolkien quote
[03:33:57] <LeoNerd> Hah
[03:34:33] <buu> LeoNerd: I mean, what is it supposed to do
[03:34:54] <LeoNerd> Wrap the parser. Be asked to load a file in whatever way it happens in PLS - I have no idea
[03:35:00] <LeoNerd> It should invoke the -actual- perl parser from perly.c
[03:35:23] <LeoNerd> It won't be able to pull in the -full- parser because that is going to want to build optree fragments and query the symbol table and a whole bunch of other crap
[03:35:35] <xenu> how will it handle BEGIN {}?
[03:35:38] <xenu> just ignore it?
[03:35:38] <LeoNerd> So that will require loooods of little stub functions that all return NULL or FALSE or whatever
[03:35:52] <LeoNerd> It'll parse it then not execute it, because it won't -have- an optree
[03:36:18] <buu> LeoNerd: Here's the stubs from the server's perspective: https://github.com/rmzg/pls/blob/master/lib/PLS/Handler.pm#L53
[03:36:18] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ pls/Handler.pm at master · rmzg/pls · GitHub ]
[03:36:32] <LeoNerd> The trick of the PLS then is to replace those optree-building functions with brand new content, that builds up an AST instead, noting all the syntax information in addition to things like file/line/column position
[03:36:58] <LeoNerd> The symboltable query functions are going to be a bit trickier. We could just say no to everything but then code that would want prototypes isn't going to work
[03:37:04] <LeoNerd> So we may have to insert guesses into there

[17:56:35] <Altreus> Can't say I've ever used it myself but I've used modules that do
[17:56:53] <alh> Don't ties rely on magic, so testing ties tests that magic behaves somewhat?

[22:12:56] <krismatrix> So...I have a perl program, that calls anotherprogram written by a vendor. I don't know all the intricacies of the vendor program, but let's say it solves some problem. This program either has a bug or perhaps a problem that occurs when we have an error in our input file, where the program just gets stuck and doesn't move on. Is there a way to say to my perl program, that if the vendor program is taking longer than 10 mins, kill, and continue on.
[22:13:21] <Grinnz> Ovid_: tangentially driving up my "reinvent my own elasticsearch client with Mojo::UserAgent" priority again
[22:13:43] <Ovid_> Grinnz++
[22:14:09] <thrig> fork/exec and have parent murder child if alarm() fires
[22:14:37] <Grinnz> it's really a rather simple api... that elasticsearch thinks they can bully people into using their cloud services that way is bonkers
[22:15:00] <krismatrix> thrig is there an example code somewhere that might show the use of fork, exec, alarm()?
[22:15:15] <Ovid_> Or you can also try https://metacpan.org/pod/Search::Typesense
[22:15:16] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Search::Typesense - Perl interface to the Typesense search engine - metacpan.org ]
[22:16:23] <Grinnz> Ovid_: all of my elasticsearch use cases tend to rely on a specific subset of elasticsearch features which nobody else seems to implement... but more alternatives are always good
[22:16:46] <bit4bit> krismatrix: how you call the program? maybe you can use the shell command *timeout* to wrap to vendor program
[22:17:05] <Ovid_> Grinnz: note that Search::Typesense is built with Mojo tools and could probably use some love as it doesn't implement everything Typesense does (for example, the new geosearch features)
[22:17:12] <krismatrix> I just use system or `` for calling the vendor program.
[22:17:15] *** Joins: Skarn (~skarn@user/skarn)
[22:17:47] <LeoNerd> I don't know if there's an example specifically, but it's the standard fork/exec, with an alarm in the middle of it. Play Lego with it
[22:17:58] <thrig> misc/timeout/timeout.pl in 9ab1e0ff428bd4c79f21b6103ff8dac76aeb9de5 of https://github.com/thrig/scripts/
[22:17:58] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ GitHub - thrig/scripts: scripts to extend the unix environment ]
[22:18:38] <Grinnz> $work needs infix searching, geosearching, and unicode normalization... perldoc.perl.org needs stopwords, symbol matching, stemming, and word delimiter indexing...
[22:18:54] <bit4bit> if have unix-like see *timeout --help*, you wrap like `timeout 3 vendor vendorargs`
[22:19:10] <thrig> assuming you have the GNU timeout, anyways
[22:20:27] <krismatrix> That is good information bit4bit.
[22:20:52] <krismatrix> As for you github link thrig...i appear to be missing someting. I see the misc/ directory, but don't see timeout/timeout.pl

[22:22:27] <Grinnz> krismatrix: IPC::Run has a timeout feature
[22:23:57] <krismatrix> thank you. I will look into these options.
[22:24:46] <zgu> this would be a lot easier if someone could just solve the halting problem
[22:25:00] <zgu> damn you turing
[22:30:36] <zgu> i'd probably do some kind of non blocking read on the pipe with a timeout instead of alarm() though
[22:31:08] <zgu> which could be fairly trivial with one of the various async/event loop modules
