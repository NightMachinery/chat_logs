[00:42:18] <|dbotdan> Hannah Ritchie (@_HannahRitchie, 2021-08-19 19:09): ‘Because differences in capacity factors of different energy sources means that capacity (in watts) is not the best metric for comparison. Energy output is better.’

[00:42:31] <feepbot> Twitter / Error
[00:43:48] <two2thehead> isn't MWh a megawatt spread equally over an hour?
[00:43:55] <ggreer> yes
[00:44:15] <two2thehead> ah
[00:44:28] <two2thehead> I think it's an industry standard thing
[00:45:02] <ggreer> seems like they picked a stupid unit and rationalize it
[00:45:23] <ggreer> because if you divide all the numbers by 24, you get megawatts

[00:47:32] <two2thehead> yeah, I'm remembering correctly, it's an industry standard used to deliberately differentiate between power output alone versus power output over time
[00:47:40] <gwern> most of the figs on my fig tree have all ripened, and the tree is swarming with insects of every sort I haven't seen before, and it looks like the birds are making a dent in the figs too. this is probably a good thing from the fig tree's perspective, because that's how fig seeds get spread, by insectivores... being eaten is a fig's way of making more figs, you might say. I wonder what sort of...
[00:47:46] <gwern> ...qualia fig trees would have if they have qualia? Would they perceive this as damage, from the eating, or as a big success? or both - are fig trees... masochists? "Oh yes, it hurts so good! yes - yes - yes - eat me harder! faster, faster, faster! rip it off me and swallow!" (...are fig trees harambo...)
[00:47:50] <two2thehead> I can see why they insist on using and differentiating the terms
[00:48:40] <ggreer> so use the same unit but with a different prefix. eg: brake hosepower versus wheel horsepower

[02:51:37] <Robomot> ImageNet contains naturally occurring NeuralHash collisions (NeuralHash is the perceptual hashing model that back's Apple's new CSAM (child sexual abuse material) reporting mechanism. It's an algorithm that takes an image as input and returns a 96-bit unique identifier (a hash) that should match for two images that are "the same" (besides some minor perturbations like JPEG)
[02:51:44] <[itchyjunk]> countires can request certain hashes be added?

[02:53:05] <[itchyjunk]> wouldn't taliban have to actually produce the hash for all ankles ?
[02:53:47] <[itchyjunk]> That means they would have to go around taking pictures of ankles of all women or some such to generate those hashes?

And I looked him up and I was like, huh, he’s the world’s youngest billionaire. And then somehow, I don’t know how, and I don’t have any defense of this, but Elie and I were just like, “This just doesn’t seem very high priority.” I don’t know
[03:05:34] <feepbot> why. I don’t know how we reached that conclusion. I’m trying to think through the logic in my head… Rob Wiblin: You had a lot on that week. Holden Karnofsky: Yeah, I don’t know what was going on...But then at the same time, I really wanted to go to San Francisco because there was this girl who had recently become single, and I wanted to go on a date with her. And I had a
[03:05:35] <feepbot> dilemma, which was I didn’t want to just show up in San Francisco being like, “Hey, I came out to go on a date.” I just, I don’t know. I just thought that would be weird. Rob Wiblin: Little bit too keen. Holden Karnofsky: And so Elie and I made an agreement, which was that I paid for the plane ticket to go out to San Francisco to meet Cari and Dustin, but then I got to
[03:05:40] <feepbot> officially say, if anyone asked me, that I was there to meet Cari and Dustin, not to go on a date with this girl.'

And by the time this podcast comes out, we’ll have just had our first kid. So that
[03:14:15] <feepbot> also was good. It was a good trip.'

[03:20:48] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Holden Karnofsky: One of the things that I say in the description of my blog is that it’s about ‘avant-garde effective altruism.’ So, the analogy for me would be if you hear jazz, you might hear Louis Armstrong and you might think, “That sounds great. I want to get into jazz.” And then if you meet people who’ve spent their entire life listening to jazz, a lot
[03:20:48] <feepbot> of their favorite music, you’re just going to be like, “What the hell is that? That’s not music. That’s not jazz. What is that? That’s just noise. That’s just someone kind of screeching into a horn or something.” Avant-garde effective altruism has a similar feel for me. I started by saying, “Hey, gosh, people are dying of malaria and a $5 bed net can prevent it.”
[03:20:49] <feepbot> And I was really interested in using my career to prevent that, but I was greedy about it. Over the years, I’d always be like, “But could we do even better? Is there a way we can help even more people?”'

[03:27:05] <feepbot> <gwern> 'So I think one of the things that I also talk about in this series is this idea of looking at how impressive the system seems to you, and projecting that forward. And I think it’s just dicey. I watch AI experts talk about this stuff, and it feels like there’s no rhyme or reason to it. I remember one case of a person who was like, “Oh, we’ll never get there. AIs
[03:27:05] <feepbot> can’t do this. They can’t do that. They can’t do this. They can’t do that.” And then all of a sudden there was some paper that came out and this person was like, “Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no, no, it’s coming soon.” I looked at the paper and I was like, “I don’t even know what you’re talking… What is new here??” And then other people would look at it
[03:27:05] <feepbot> and be unimpressed. And it’s very hard to pin this stuff down. You can look at what GPT-3 is doing… I think in some ways it’s very impressive. In some ways it’s not. It’s able to continue stories that people start, it’s able to imitate their tone. It’s able to answer questions. It’s able to pass a lot of these language tests that people used to think would be the
[03:27:10] <feepbot> really hard ones. That seems to be a lot for one model trained in a simple way, but you could break it all day with all kinds of weaknesses and weird stuff that it does.'

[04:35:24] <two2thehead> "Pashto and Dari naturally lend themselves to puns and insults—there is a lot of rhyming inherent to the languages, and many words share double meanings. Part of this bullshitting stemmed from a penchant for repetition. The Afghans I met would repeat a name or statement, or anything really, dozens of times to make a point. But this repetition intensified when talking over radios. A man named Kalima taught me this. None of us know who Kalima was
[04:35:25] <two2thehead> , though it’s generally accepted that he wasn’t anyone important. But someone—we don’t know who—really wanted to talk to him. So he called his name.

[05:15:47] <ggreer> I just have to touch the wheel and it drives for me. it changes lanes to pass slow stuff, changes lanes back to get out of the passing lane, takes onramps/offramps, etc
[05:15:53] <ggreer> it makes road trips far less tiring

He got interested in riding while shooting Jane Eyre, when all the actors got horses except for the director, who...
[06:01:16] <gwern> ...was forbidden from riding for insurance reasons. But Fukunaga is athletic by inclination—long after he quit professional snowboarding, he did capoeira, until that, too, took too much of a toll on his body—and adventurous by nature. After Jane Eyre wrapped, he took riding lessons of his own and swiftly mastered it to the point that his instructor recommended polo. Now he plays weekly...
[06:01:22] <gwern> ...with a bunch of hedge fund guys. "It's competitive," Fukunaga says. "Like, on the other team yesterday, one of the guys got so angry he swung his mallet and knocked over the goal post and got kicked out."' <-- but don't get the wrong idea or anything

The project, CluShare, was built to stake tokens with the goal of providing a charity focus to help people around the world.

[11:10:08] <nshepperd2> at first i sent them a statement from the same bank, because i did actually get a paper one of those once, but they were like 'sorry, it has to be a *different* bank'
[11:10:38] <feep[work]> this is not something that would happen in germany :D
[11:10:56] <feep[work]> not because we're in any way better or less bureaucratic but just cause your address is public record
[11:11:04] <feep[work]> er, wrong term
[11:11:07] <feep[work]> on record*
[11:11:16] <nshepperd2> think i might have to just go sign up for something i don't need for the sole purpose of being sent a letter

[12:06:03] <nshepperd2> not anymore
[12:06:17] <quanticle> Hmmm... do you still have the expired license?
[12:06:30] <nshepperd2> yeah, it's expired but i have it
[12:06:41] <quanticle> Ask them if that's okay as proof of address
[12:06:58] <nshepperd2> this whole thing has me thinking about going out monday and getting it renewed
[12:07:23] <quanticle> Well, I don't know what state you're in, but most states have an option where you can get a non-license ID card
[12:07:36] <nshepperd2> which would ironically result in launder the bank statement (showing my address) which they won't accept into a drivers license (showing my address) which they will
[12:07:38] <quanticle> If you don't want to go through the hassle of actually proving that you can drive or w/e
[12:08:18] <nshepperd2> it didn't expire too long ago so it seems i can just get a new one without doing the test or whatever
[12:08:28] <quanticle> Cool
[12:08:33] <kuudes> hmm. my driver's licence does not contain more address info than my id card
[12:08:47] <kuudes> possibly less
[12:09:03] <quanticle> Yeah, here the driver's license *is* the de-facto ID card
[12:09:14] <quanticle> We don't have a separate identity database
[12:09:37] <kuudes> in eu iirc driver's licence is basicly deprecated as an id
[12:10:00] <kuudes> ie it is legally been specified as unacceptable as id, but often works if there is no strict law about the iding
[12:11:11] <kuudes> RiversHaveWings, nshepperd2 do we have a nice link on apple's cp hash nn being reversible, or its parent being reversible?
[12:11:15] <quanticle> This has led to a spat between several states, Minnesota included, and the federal government where the federal government has demanded that states put in additional security measures on their ID cards (so as to prevent terrorists from using fake IDs to get onto flights). Minnesota didn't want to pay, so Minnesota drivers licenses can't be used to board planes. You have to get a special "RealID"
[12:11:18] <quanticle> driver's license if you want to have one that's valid for getting on a plane. It's bullshit, I hate it, and I just applied for one last week.
[12:12:06] <kuudes> I have got the ID card thing because I don't want to give my fingerprints, which are taken for a passport

[12:13:41] <kuudes> it would be handy if I could tie my google account to my real identity, so that I could get it back if someone breaches it or similar
[12:14:17] <kuudes> as the google account affects my life quite much, given phones are androids etc
[12:14:35] <kuudes> I would like google to submit to finnish law on my stuff :-(
[12:14:45] <nshepperd2> here in my corner of .au the government is run by cavemen so there is no id card separate from a driver license
[12:14:47] <saturn2> what's the point of not giving your fingerprints?
[12:14:59] <nshepperd2> but you can use a gun license or a boat license instead, lol

[12:15:26] <saturn2> i see
[12:15:44] <kuudes> indeed as gwern has pointed out, there might be little to lose on giving fingerprints or dna to the general database

[12:18:32] <kuudes> boats also have higher dui limit than land vehicles
[12:18:40] <nshepperd2> oh i dunno about that
[12:19:02] <kuudes> which has recently again brought to public discussion, perhaps because more n00bs got into boating with covid restrictions
[12:19:33] <kuudes> an interesting loophole is also that for some reason pleasure boating, ie small private boats, are exempted from covid border restrictions

[14:41:16] <PapuaHardyNet> Kant?
[14:41:19] <quanticle> I'm fairly impressed that you got through it
[14:41:42] <cpopell> I got most of the way through it, stopped, and am retackling it
[14:41:54] <cpopell> spaced repetition has helped a lot for memorizing all the fairly complex vocabulary terms
[14:42:07] <quanticle> Because I've tried reading Critique of Pure Reason three or four times, and every time, my reaction is basically the same as https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/wrongthoughts.html
[14:42:09] <Robomot> Stove, What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts
[14:42:52] <cpopell> the way I read Kant
[14:43:02] <cpopell> well, let me copy paste something I wrote for a friend earlier
[14:43:16] <cpopell> "Kant's "A Critique of Pure Reason" is interesting because it's clearly the attempt of a man to work through the firmware and package dependencies of the human mind, without having those metaphors to lean on. He's attempting to simultaneously detail a system, how the parts interrelate in time and structure, and also simply build a language for talking about these ideas."
[14:44:21] <cpopell> contrast this to Hegel, which I _did_ rage quit through Philosophy of Right 40% of the way through
[14:44:40] <nshepperd2> so kant's only mistake was not being babbage
[14:45:10] <feep[work]> immanuel turing
[14:45:29] <cpopell> there are some interesting papers analogizing Kant's threefold synthesis to robotics and computer vision
[14:45:39] <quanticle> Okay, but there's absolutely no evidence to suggest that anything close to that metaphor is a fruitful one. The human mind does not divide neatly into hardware and software, nor does it divide neatly into the sorts of structured modules that philosophers (and computer scientists) are so fond of when they talk about minds.
[14:46:01] <cpopell> you're absolutely right! I wouldn't build a system on it
[14:46:09] <quanticle> In other words, to me, reading Kant and trying to glean insights about the mind is like trying to glean insights about physics by reading Aristotle.
[14:46:14] <cpopell> but it is very much intellectually stimulating at making me ask questions about my mind
[14:46:50] <cpopell> and moreover what he got wrong is interesting too
[14:46:52] <saturn2> what's an example of a question you asked about your mind?
[14:48:10] <cpopell> saturn2: how do the stream of perceptions we have of the world around us get put into a continuous sense of time?
[14:49:16] <saturn2> do you have an answer?
[14:49:59] <cpopell> nope! but gotta start with a question.
[14:50:05] <feep[work]> I'm not sure I perceive a continuous sense of time at all
[14:50:17] <feep[work]> rephrase: I'm not sure *anyone* perceives a continuous sense of time
[14:50:35] <cpopell> I would say there's very few things any one philosopher provides uniquely, but Kant has pretty decent density at asking interesting questions
[14:50:49] <cpopell> It's not something I would really recommend at the top of my list of interesting reads though
[14:51:10] <feep[work]> I think I perceive a sense of motion, but this could be attached to a frozen snapshot just as easily
[14:51:15] <feep[work]> and I am not sure how I would tell that apart.
[14:51:32] <saturn2> interesting
[14:51:45] <feep[work]> I think it may make sense to think of consciousness as primarily a short-term integrator, like a crt screen
[14:52:16] <cpopell> feep[work]: which is, as I understand it, the premise of Mind is Flat
[14:52:19] <feep[work]> an event occurs and its qualia is logged; for the next half second or so, it may be referenced and correlated with other events
[14:52:37] <feep[work]> then the latter it gets, the more you have to focus (attain signal relevance) to correlate it
[14:52:40] <feep[work]> cpopell: ooh.
[14:52:49] <quanticle> My sense of time is definitely not continuous; when I sleep and wake up, I feel like no time (or a very short period of time) has passed.
[14:52:56] <feep[work]> I mean well yeah, that's a given
[14:53:06] <feep[work]> but I'm arguing it's not even continuous in the second-to-second scale.
[14:53:22] <quanticle> Transhuman goal: embed a quartz RTC so that I *do* have a continuous sense of time
[14:53:25] <cpopell> but also that's not that far off of Kantianism - when I say continuity of time, I mean the sequencing of it, that we don't have separate, disconnected sets of experience, and that (for the most part) our experiences are sequenced in time
[14:53:35] <feep[work]> quanticle: your perception of the rtc would still be impulsive.
[14:53:49] <feep[work]> cpopell: hang on, that's not something that needs to be proven
[14:53:49] <cpopell> which, blah blah, he calls the manifold of intuition
[14:53:49] <quanticle> feep[work]: Not if it generated an interrupt
[14:53:55] <feep[work]> it follows from, you know, simple causality.
[14:54:07] <saturn2> quartz RTCs are not continuous, they make discrete pulses at a given frequency...
[14:54:15] <cpopell> you could have a system that indexed experiences in reverse, feep[work] 
[14:54:17] <feep[work]> quanticle: it would have to generate continuous interrupts all the time, at which point that rtc clock would become the ABSOLUTE MOST IMPORTANT thing in your consciousness
[14:54:22] <feep[work]> you would not be conscious of anything else
[14:54:28] <feep[work]> cpopell: ... uh, what?
[14:54:34] <quanticle> saturn2: Yes, but the human mind is clockless
[14:54:36] <feep[work]> a brain that most relevantly remembered being born?
[14:54:50] <cpopell> basically! it would be stupid, but I can conceive of a system like that
[14:54:54] <feep[work]> I mean sure
[14:54:56] <feep[work]> it could be built
[14:55:05] <feep[work]> but it would never arise naturally, because that's just a bad way to build a mind
[14:55:15] <feep[work]> and like ... isn't that answer enough?
[14:55:25] <cpopell> He's trying to label the various faculties in the mind
[14:55:37] <feep[work]> right, but in this case there's no sense in building the faculty any other way
[14:55:42] <cpopell> so just pointing out that there is something giving them order at all is the point
[14:55:51] <quanticle> feep[work]: Yes, it would generate an interrupt at which point the RTC would be the most important thing, but then the interrupt would fade
[14:55:52] <feep[work]> oyeah
[14:55:59] <feep[work]> cpopell: though to be fair, my episodic memory is almost nonexistent
[14:56:05] <feep[work]> so I only experience this at a very short scale
[14:56:12] <feep[work]> most of my long-term memories are unordered.
[14:56:29] <feep[work]> quanticle: no, like ... okay, you could generate slow interrupts I guess
[14:56:30] <feep[work]> like once a minute
[14:56:35] <feep[work]> but you could already do that with a clock with a buzzer.
[14:56:40] <cpopell> Right - and that's kind of interesting! I also have mental things that go absolutely against his mental model, mostly to do with imagination
[14:56:43] <cpopell> since I have total aphantasia
[14:56:57] <cpopell> but it's an enjoyable read because it makes me dwell on these questions
[14:57:02] <feep[work]> right but like, episodic memories make sense in the model of consciousness, right?
[14:57:09] <feep[work]> memory recall is just another module
[14:57:10] <cpopell> as opposed to *cough* premium mediocre essays on premium mediocrity

[20:15:41] <yorick> but I'm close to "ugh I'll do it myself"
[20:16:01] <feep> the manganese study seems to interestingly claim that manganese from food doesn't raise mnh, but I don't see that they do a check for an iq/food intake correlation

[20:21:02] <feep> like, a lot
[20:21:12] <feep> but if you eat food with *a thousand* times more manganese in, there is no effect
[20:21:43] <feep> I gotta be honest, I wouldn't change my formulation based on this study either :V
[20:22:05] <kuudes> is hentainese heavier or lighter than manganese?

[20:59:01] <kuudes> it decays to the stable manganese

[20:59:11] <feep> is it even in wells
[20:59:21] <kuudes> it arised from nuclear tests
[20:59:43] <feep> yorick: I mean, I support that question
[20:59:46] <kuudes> and there was apparently a lot of it while there were nuclear tests in air
[20:59:47] <feep> why *not* 2x the manganese
[20:59:54] <kuudes> so maybe those places could have got fallout
[21:00:04] <feep> kuudes: it's an interesting theory

[21:08:58] <yorick> feep: hair uptakes iron and it decays later?
[21:09:10] <feep> kuudes: oh, you're hooking it purely to manganese as a marker of the blast zone
[21:09:18] <yorick> or, children wash their hair with water but not food
[21:09:22] <feep> kuudes: I'd still be curious why food doesn't matter
[21:09:34] <feep> yorick: right, but *food intake was not associated with iq loss.*
[21:09:55] <yorick> how do they control for that
[21:09:58] <feep> I feel that part of the study should be bolded.
[21:10:08] <feep> like ... different foods have different levels? they did a survey of what sort of thing they ate.
[21:10:23] <kuudes> maybe the nuclear toxins are soluble
[21:10:39] <feep> would still end up in food via water intake
[21:10:41] <kuudes> so they sink into ground but it you pump the groundwater for drinking water, you get the toxins as well
[21:11:08] <kuudes> those places were selected so that they took groundwater as their drinking water
[21:11:16] <feep> nope, it holds for tapwater too
[21:11:20] <yorick> but they controlled for other metals
[21:11:22] <feep> might be ground source tapwater tho
[21:11:46] <feep> yorick: right, I think kuudes' theory is that the iron-55 is long gone
[21:11:58] <feep> but the decayed manganese survives as a marker of the blast zone
[21:12:05] <kuudes> "Municipalities were considered as potential study sites if their aqueduct was supplied by groundwater."
[21:12:11] <feep> kuudes: ah fair nuf
[21:12:15] <kuudes> in Methods
[21:12:31] * feep : "what does hpmor have to do with manganese"
[21:13:01] <kuudes> and Fe would be the normal amount
[21:13:11] <kuudes> as radio Fe is produced from normal Fe
[21:13:14] <kuudes> so it would not differ
[21:13:21] <kuudes> at most there would be less iron in the samples
[21:13:42] <kuudes> so maybe they still eat radio Fe, and it decays in them to Mn?
[21:13:55] <kuudes> I mean, if no one puts a geiger on things, no one notices
[21:14:34] <kuudes> I guess a replication of the study somewhere else would be interesting
[21:14:47] <kuudes> if effects disappear, maybe look more thoroughly to the original place

Those who couldn’t work within the new rules were offered a $1,000 bonus to quit, provided they agreed to sign a nondisclosure agreement that promised, among other things, they would not sue the company.

[23:52:45] <shawwwn> looks like RiversHaveWings just went mainstream
[23:53:58] <shawwwn> (#3 on /r/all)
[23:54:08] <gwern> we were into rivers before it was cool
[23:54:11] <RiversHaveWings> eheh
[23:54:26] <shawwwn> "This was achieved using VQGAN+Clip and After effects for some zoom distortion
[23:54:26] <shawwwn> Follow @MathisNoiz on socials I make all sorts of stuff and not just AI :)"
[23:54:47] <shawwwn> I remember being into VQGAN+Clip before anyone here recognized it was cool other than RHW
[23:54:54] <shawwwn> told ya so
[23:55:37] <RiversHaveWings> I remember going on r/deepdream in January and going "what is this Big Sleep thing everyone is into, the outputs are so bad-looking"
[23:56:11] <shawwwn> I had the same thought

Is it kind of like... peering into a crystal ball, or something? Reading tea leaves? | Or could you show an example of a prompt that worked well?’
[23:56:36] <gwern> wasn't the original optimizing purely by clip, no vqgan generator?
[23:56:59] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: by the time i got to it Ryan Murdock was using BigGAN
[23:57:05] <RiversHaveWings> he did SIREN first
[23:57:10] <gwern> yeah, biggan was a step up but still not great
[23:57:29] <gwern> I don't think until vqgan was plugged in that it started getting at all comprable to dall-e
[23:57:40] <RiversHaveWings> Then I started posting my own outputs and everyone started asking me how I got them so good
[23:57:54] <RiversHaveWings> (It was literally just EMA on the BigGAN latents or something incremental)
[23:58:04] <shawwwn> I actually wasn't certain whether you were literally the first to try VQGAN + CLIP
[23:58:10] <shawwwn> nice find.
[23:58:18] <RiversHaveWings> Ryan and I tried it around the same time in March
[23:58:19] <RiversHaveWings> Separately
[23:58:38] <RiversHaveWings> And then we both came back to it in April, separately, and made it actually good enough to release code
[23:58:50] <RiversHaveWings> I think he was actually the first by a little bit
[23:59:04] <shawwwn> so you're the netwon to his liebniz, or vice versa.
[23:59:18] <RiversHaveWings> Ryan's Colab notebooks were paywalled, on his Patreon.
[23:59:22] <shawwwn> it's always neat seeing multiple discovery in action. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery
[23:59:23] <RiversHaveWings> So mine were the ones that took off.
