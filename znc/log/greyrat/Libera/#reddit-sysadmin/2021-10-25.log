[11:32:31] <SirSceptalot> then again, I don't go around asking people about their preferred keyboard layout either.
[11:33:10] <sd> 03<Vâ€‹ardy> was causing issues with a vm console because they default to qwerty and ignore user preferences for layout
[11:33:52] <sd> 03<Vâ€‹ardy> but yeah, you'd never think to ask if they're using a different keyboard layout
[11:35:25] <SirSceptalot> "hey sexy baby, what kinda keyboard layout you use? Dvorak, ooh, you dirty girl"
[11:35:44] <SirSceptalot> I mean, not that I advise talking that way to coworkers
[11:35:55] <SirSceptalot> on second though, I do, lemme know the results
[11:36:14] <nobyk> dvorak, sounds like a keyboard layout for Dothraki or something

[11:39:55] <SirSceptalot> if you want to completely nerd out of this world you could get a custom keyboard with no print on it and THEN set your layout to dvorak

[13:25:47] <Activ8> it does VALOS, you have to keep moving

[13:26:27] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> keep moving companies, I assume?
[13:26:27] <Activ8> I'm 37 Lancehead. Yes I did sysadmin when I was 15 managing servers
[13:26:31] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> It can be interpreted in a lot of ways
[13:26:40] <Activ8> either moving companies or moving sysadmin roles and responsibilities
[13:27:18] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> I mean I'm gonna be living in hell. I can do both software development and sysadmin.

[13:27:52] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> "Oh we only need this one guy because he can do it all!"
[13:27:54] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> I properly started doing sysadmin when I started my study, and not until my second year
[13:27:54] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> Yeah
[13:28:02] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> So like... 2.5 years now?
[13:28:06] <Activ8> a tip is to concentrate on something you enjoy, don't be the "know it all" kinda guy
[13:28:24] <Activ8> aim for a special field something that you like
[13:28:49] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> I can see that. I'm currently doing everything because it's my first week here
[13:28:55] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> I don't mind it for now, keeps me busy
[13:29:02] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> I want to specialize in one field but be capable of doing a lot.
[13:29:03] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> But it'd definitely get exhausting if I keep it up forever
[13:29:08] <Activ8> my field is 0365 migrations, setups and active directory migrations
[13:29:23] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> So specialize in one thing but keep growing as a person
[13:29:28] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> As long as you know how to say no, because if it becomes known that you're capable people are going to bother you
[13:29:38] <sd> 08<Lâ€‹ancehead> A LOT
[13:29:39] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> I mean hell I've made my own Discord bot etc
[13:29:44] <Activ8> I'm moving into azure field as of late.  I have been doing a lot of azure migrations
[13:29:48] <sd> 05<Vâ€‹ALOS> I know how to write code & I've done it for a big part of my life.

[17:29:21] <mistiry> she paddled up to the boat
[17:29:36] <Hunterkll> and *if* you get charged under a flag statute you can immediately appeal it straight to the supreme court

[17:32:11] <mistiry> i was a little scared in Dubai when i got pulled to secondary screening
[17:32:22] <mistiry> even having THC in your blood can be considered possession
[17:32:23] <Hunterkll> because unlike the US........ you may not get your chance to call the embassy .................. for a long time
[17:32:37] <mistiry> and i definitely would have had it in my blood LOL
[17:32:43] <Hunterkll> mistiry: some dude got jammed up for years just for having a nug he stepped on in the airport
[17:32:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:32:47] <Hunterkll> in dubai
[17:32:51] <mistiry> yeah they do NOT play 
[17:33:06] <vinrock> see i have zero interest in going plaes likethat
[17:33:06] <mistiry> i made sure i used a new backpack that i never possibly had put weed in before
[17:33:13] <mistiry> Dubai was just a layover
[17:33:17] <Hunterkll> when i'm going to non-EU countries i'm, well 100% on point
[17:33:18] <mistiry> ...3 different times
[17:33:43] <Hunterkll> canada and mexico i don't give a fuck cuz i can just basically run to the border 
[17:33:46] <spiderman> does dubai look as cool in person as it does online?
[17:33:59] <Hunterkll> Russia? I literally checked in with the US embassy every day 
[17:34:03] <mistiry> but when the security guard is eyeballing you and tells you to step out of line for more screenings, its makes you a little nervous lol
[17:34:29] <mistiry> spiderman: i was only in the airport. could see Burj Khalifa though,
[17:34:39] <mistiry> saw the manmade islands when we flew in
[17:34:44] <Hunterkll> In fact i went to a strip club, and called multiple people, told them where i'd be, called the embassy with a checkin timeline, etc
[17:34:44] <mistiry> airport was huge and quite nice
[17:35:09] <mistiry> Hunterkll: we walked past the US embassy every morning when going from hotel to office in Bangkok
[17:35:29] <Hunterkll> yea lol
[17:35:46] <mistiry> my favorite trip overseas though was the Europe trip. Vienna was fucking cool. Slovakia was stunningly beautiful.
[17:35:46] <Hunterkll> fun times calling state department "IM OK DONT WORRY IM ON TIME"
[17:36:17] <Hunterkll> fuckin russian titty bars
[17:36:22] <mistiry> and the train station in Paris can fuck off

[17:36:31] <mistiry> NO AC

[21:53:50] <signalblue> yeah and what relevant channels are on DALnet

[21:54:01] <thegodsquirrel> relevant to me
[21:54:13] <mistiry> i dont need to hide my IP, because i dont care if my IP is exposed. because its just a VPS IP.

[21:55:52] <A-KO> $1300 to fix the car
[21:55:53] <A-KO> weeee
[21:55:54] <signalblue> here's the difference
[21:56:03] <signalblue> A-KO: oh no what happened
[21:56:45] <A-KO> wheel hub assembly going bad on one side. They said the other side isn't likely far behind
[21:56:52] <A-KO> so to replace both parts + labor is $1300
[21:57:06] <signalblue> perhaps get a 2nd opinion
[21:57:19] <signalblue> and or find a different place/not the dealer
[21:57:50] <A-KO> eh from what I was reading online that's not too far off from the average pricing
[21:58:00] <A-KO> plus they can have it done today

[22:00:03] <vinrock> it's an easy job too
[22:00:13] <signalblue> it may be a bosch part

[22:00:56] <vinrock> id find a local mechanic on craigslist thatll do it for $500

[22:01:19] <signalblue> oh wow
[22:01:19] <vinrock> fuck that
[22:01:37] <A-KO> I mean
[22:01:41] <vinrock> id get rid of the car cuz its at the pint where shits just wearing out and you're gona be throwing money at it
[22:01:42] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: how much of that is heavy traffic?
[22:01:46] <JollyRgrs> what's the travel time?
[22:02:13] <A-KO> JollyRgrs: without traffic it's ~45 minutes travel time. With? around 1 hour. If there's accidents, way more. But there are plenty of ways around that if needed.
[22:02:33] <A-KO> vinrock: I mean, $1300 is still cheaper than a new car
[22:02:37] <A-KO> and I like not having a car payment so
[22:02:44] <signalblue> i think I'm 30.5 miles from work lol
[22:02:48] <JollyRgrs> that's surprisingly not that bad for a 40 mile trip
[22:02:59] <signalblue> i really love owning cars in cash
[22:03:06] <signalblue> it's just plain better a lot of times
[22:03:10] <A-KO> JollyRgrs: yeah it's really not too bad. It's also why I don't move. To move "closer" and get similar pricing for rent, travel time actually goes up because there's more traffic.
[22:03:28] <A-KO> So it's like
[22:03:30] <JollyRgrs> signalblue: "i really love having to make payments on my car loan" ... said no one ever
[22:03:39] <A-KO> if it's still going to take me 45-60 minutes to get to work, I may as well stay here
[22:03:46] <JollyRgrs> yup
[22:03:54] <A-KO> there's an apartment building right next to work but it's fucking $2500/month for a studio
[22:03:56] <A-KO> a god damn studio
[22:03:58] <signalblue> JollyRgrs: it all depends on the car
[22:04:01] <A-KO> and they're like 580 square feet lol
[22:04:15] <JollyRgrs> signalblue: nope, doesn't matter the car... no one "loves" having a car payment
[22:04:20] <JollyRgrs> they may love the car, but not the payment
[22:04:24] <signalblue> i'd love making the payments on a 2014 Ferrari on which I have a 144 month loan
[22:04:35] <A-KO> with car prices the way they are now people are nuts
[22:04:40] <A-KO> fucking $600/month car payments and shit

[23:35:28] <signofzeta> My wife made a kale salad with apples, Bleu cheese, candied walnuts, and a dijon vinaigrette.  Amazing.
[23:35:35] <vinrock> im a big fan of kale
[23:35:39] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Salt and olive oil, roast on high temp
[23:35:43] <signofzeta> Sprouts are beautiful little creations.  She hates them, but I adore them.
[23:35:43] <vinrock> it has a very satisfying chew
[23:35:54] <JollyRgrs> signofzeta: dude, it's really simple... i prefer french cut if possible... just water, butter, garlic (a lot of it) and a little salt... let it boil down good so there's just a little water left (so more "flavor" soaks up into the beans)
[23:36:06] <vinrock> ok what about asparagus
[23:36:10] <JollyRgrs> nope
[23:36:13] <vinrock> JAYSUS CHRIST
[23:36:15] <JollyRgrs> wife likes it, i don't
[23:36:25] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> meh on it unless it's super fresh and not cooked to death
[23:36:41] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Like I pulled it outta the ground an hour ago fresh
[23:36:45] <vinrock> asparagus is delicious!
[23:36:49] <signofzeta> I like green beans, plain, and steamed in the microwave bags.  I usually mixed them with rice and lentils, and other stuff. 
[23:36:49] <vinrock> yeah if its not super fresh the stalk sucks
[23:36:53] <JollyRgrs> when i was a kid, i would eat corn and that's about the only veggie i'd eat
[23:37:21] <JollyRgrs> wife loves cooking it down in bacon grease (and with bacon pieces, too)
[23:37:28] <JollyRgrs> (asparagus)

[23:41:04] <sd> 11<Fâ€‹our 'n' Twenty Traveller Pie> If I could cook a round of meals for you to try you'd understand... I have a problem of cooking things where you just want 'a bit more' until there's none left

[23:41:13] <sd> 11<Fâ€‹our 'n' Twenty Traveller Pie> Yeahhh black garlic is the bomb
[23:41:18] <vinrock> black dont crack yo
[23:41:24] <JollyRgrs> i saw "volcanic salt" (black salt) the other day on a cooking show... i was like "wtf is that?"
[23:41:36] <vinrock> oh dude salt is a new thing i found out about
[23:41:39] <vinrock> theres sooooo many types
[23:41:40] <mistiry> i still havent tried black garlic. loooove regular garlic.
[23:41:45] <vinrock> black garlic is super good
[23:41:48] <thegodsquirrel> black salt is great
[23:41:57] <sd> 11<Fâ€‹our 'n' Twenty Traveller Pie> Jolly - it's garlic fermented to a paste, total game changer
[23:41:58] <vinrock> lotta sugar conversion, tastes like pure umami
[23:42:00] <thegodsquirrel> I had some today, its a little sulphury
[23:42:06] <bloody> weeeeeeeee time soon vinrock?
[23:42:07] <JollyRgrs> we use garlic so much... it has helped me cut back on salt intake A LOT
[23:42:08] <mistiry> black garlic is not fermented
[23:42:11] <vinrock> closest i would say, its similar taste to what you get from french onion soup

[23:42:19] <sd> 11<Fâ€‹our 'n' Twenty Traveller Pie> It's aged?
[23:42:27] <vinrock> its made by doing a super slow cooking at low temp
[23:42:33] <vinrock> like a little over 100 degrees for a week or some shit
[23:42:36] <vinrock> but it makes your place REEK
[23:42:46] <JollyRgrs> lol
[23:42:46] <mistiry> yeah its the malliard reaction
