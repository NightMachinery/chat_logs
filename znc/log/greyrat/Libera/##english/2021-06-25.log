[00:01:18] <chronon> Oh, I'm just a privacy/security nut. I hate the idea that big companies collect and store our purchasing history and then sell it to Facebook, or governments, or marketers, or just let it get breached by hackers, etc.
[00:01:28] <Voxel> What does mean "dandy" in "handy dandy"?
[00:01:29] <blkshp> That's illegal
[00:01:47] <Voxel> Piracy is illegal. Period.
[00:01:55] <chronon> No, I pay my taxes, I'm very honest like that.
[00:01:57] <mdogg>  I could care less if someone wants to track how much gasoline I buy, how often I order something on Amazon, or where I buy groceries.

I don't want that collected or used against me in any way. It's not that I'm doing anything wrong. I just don't even want anyone to use it to find out how boring my life is.

[00:05:37] <chronon> I'm with tinytoast, and I often feel punished for wanting privacy. I always say no to the loyalty cards at various stores, and so I never get any discounts. I hav eto pay for my privacy every time.
[00:06:07] <chronon> Voxel, who do you mean?
[00:06:12] <blkshp> It's over privacy. You are seeing things where they are not.
[00:06:24] <blkshp> no one is selling details of your credit card purchases online.
[00:06:40] <Voxel> Think, chronon. Think. ...The price? It's so tremendously tiny compared to the resources included into such masterpieces... Ask, chronon. Ask. ...Can I do that myself? How much would that cost to me? How much time? How many lives?...
[00:06:49] <blkshp> Fine, if you don't want to buy sex toys on amazon, I get that. But not buying your fuel on a credit card. I can't get that.
[00:06:56] <mdogg> This guy is hilarious.  
[00:07:00] <Voxel> Some might also ask - "What is that exactly? How is it actually constructed, organized, developed? How to do it? How one would do it themselves? Can I do that myself? How much would that cost to me? How much time? How many lives?"...
[00:07:00] <Voxel> ...and experience a breathtaking... awe, while actually trying to realize the amount of that marvelous work... where sound wave flies away and screen lights up a majestic pixel...

[00:07:52] <Voxel> Creating/developing such masterpieces is a freaking astronomically tremendously complicated process which includes magnitudes of various subjects starting from a pixel to national tolerance and more...
[00:07:54] <chronon> It my choice. I have a IT security background, studied machine learning algorithms, etc, so I know how it goes. Most people are totally unaware of how much their privacy is being undermined and exploited by the likes of Cambridge Analytica, and many many other data brokers like them.

[00:08:52] * raccoon_dog raises an eyebrow.
[00:09:11] <blkshp> OF course, but it's my choice to disagree. I am not having a go, not telling you what to do but just asserting that I find it remiss
[00:09:22] <Voxel> And please, don't share your "piracy pride". It's simply narrow-minded and bad-mannered.
[00:09:28] <blkshp> not remiss, that's the wrong word

[00:10:57] <Voxel> onmra This is different. It's FOSS.
[00:11:10] <raccoon_dog> I don't think anyone's saying that they pirated any software -- just that they don't like using specific forms of payments for some things.
[00:11:18] <Voxel> It also assumes a donation, usually.
[00:11:27] <Voxel> You're free to donate, if you like to.
[00:11:50] <chronon> I think I've lost track of what you guys are really talking about now. Something went way off the tracks.
[00:11:58] <blkshp> ME too!
[00:12:06] <blkshp> Piracy is bad.
[00:12:08] <blkshp> And off topic
[00:12:13] <tinytoast> Voxel decided that it was all about piracy when nothing of the sort was discussed.
[00:12:15] <Voxel> raccoon_dog, - "Oh, I'm just a privacy/security nut. I hate the idea that big companies collect and store our purchasing history and then sell it to Facebook, or governments, or marketers, or just let it get breached by hackers, etc."
[00:12:41] <Voxel> Me - "Piracy is illegal. Period.", they - "No, I pay my taxes, I'm very honest like that."
[00:12:43] <Voxel> Read above.
[00:12:45] <tinytoast> Yeah looks like you can't read: privacy != piracy.
[00:12:55] <raccoon_dog> Being a privacy/security enthusiast != downloading software illegally. But yeah, I think we should move off this topic.
[00:13:01] <Voxel> Looks like you can't read: Me - "Piracy is illegal. Period.", they - "No, I pay my taxes, I'm very honest like that."

[00:17:07] <Voxel> https://welp.dev/
[00:17:10] <blkshp> An extremely annoying misuse of the word "anyhow." Generally used by people who think they're being clever. Anywho, how was your day?
[00:18:01] <blkshp> But of course, you Americans had to go one step further...
[00:18:02] <raccoon_dog> It's actually a variant of the more common "anyhoo."

[01:28:54] <lall-> i appreciate it too, but like bruno mars... i don't appreciate the things they propagate, ideas, which seem to be a norm amongst all these new musicians, they propagate ideas
[01:29:07] <lall-> and i have a 5yr old daugher tht loves the song i sent you above
[01:29:19] <lall-> she has no idea of course.... right now...
[01:29:58] <lall-> normalization of these down low acts compared to class that was PF or LZ is what bothers me, not because i'm old and grumpy
[01:29:59] <RedCrab> I listened to Baby Got Back when I was a kid. Didn't make me start slapping girls on the butt or ogle them. When you're young, you're mostly just happy to have something fun with a beat. Kids aren't exactly breaking down lyrics line by line to digest them
[01:30:51] <RedCrab> PF and LZ were banned at their time, as well. People thought they were hedonistic and promoted all kinds of bad behavior, including devil worship (when played backwards, you can hear them invoke Satan, etc etc)
[01:31:28] <lall-> sure, but their videos were not outright drunk girls having sex and walking around naked, even if they did that in real life maybe
[01:31:54] <lall-> gosh. i soudn like a fucking jerry falwell
[01:31:55] <RedCrab> I'm pretty sure a few of them had album covers with naked girls on it
[01:32:37] <RedCrab> it's just a cycle. Art goes from allegory to raw prose, and back again once the current generation wants something new
[01:33:08] <lall-> rock generation from the 50s and 60s wanted red guitars and soft rebellion aginst the system, that's fine
[01:33:21] <lall-> hip hop did that in the 80s
[01:33:45] <lall-> but nowdays it looks like ... a desire to make girls slutty, selling sex

[01:36:01] <TimMc> lall-: Pretty sure people have generally done whatever they thought they could get away with, and now people can just get away with more.
[01:36:02] <RedCrab> I think you're thinking it's new/bold because we're leading ourselves through a new era after a long tiem of repression from McCarthy and his ilk
[01:36:36] <TimMc> The culture is more permissive, so the marketing is bolder because it is *allowed* to be.
[01:37:26] *** Quits: Serpent7776 (~Serpent77@90-156-31-193.internetia.net.pl) (Quit: leaving)
[01:38:02] <lall-> yeah, well, we allow too much. i'm not for repression, but i'm not for outright glorification of debauchery either.
[01:38:04] <RedCrab> The culture now is actually starting to be more in line with where we were at around 100 years ago. After WW2 turned the general population of the USA more conservative in a lot of ways (repressingly so in many ways, and to many people)
[01:38:23] <RedCrab> lall-: you have a child? How was that child made? IVF?
[01:38:31] <TimMc> heh
[01:38:39] <lall-> i have two girls. yes.
[01:38:45] <lall-> and they look at pitbull on youtube
[01:39:41] <RedCrab> Then that sounds more like you not locking down Youtube 
[01:40:09] <RedCrab> Parents having children that want to look at mature things should not dictate the general public having access to mature things
[01:40:51] <TimMc> our child was brought to us by the fucking stork
[01:40:55] <lall-> RedCrab, it's not about that. i don't want to prevent anybody from watching anything, i'm just saying that the music before like LZ, or PF... or even GnR, or nirvana... was more about msuic, than selling sex
[01:41:00] <TimMc> s/stork//
[01:41:01] <tinsoldier> T​imMc meant: our child was brought to us by the fucking 
[01:41:02] <onmra> Maybe we should dismantle systems that make people look down on others for being promiscuous.

[01:41:11] <TimMc> lol
[01:41:22] <TimMc> I guess it's not iterative
[01:41:32] <TimMc> I tried.
[01:41:46] <lall-> it's just glorification of simplistic ideas that i have a problem with
[01:41:58] <RedCrab> onmra: as long as the being promiscious part isn't hurting someone else (I'm not a fan of people who cheat, or use their "hotter" status to get what they want while pressuring their current lover to put up with it for fear of rejection
[01:42:01] <RedCrab> I agree
[01:42:05] *** Joins: foobaz212 (~foobaz212@cpc84737-aztw28-2-0-cust8.18-1.cable.virginm.net)
[01:42:56] <onmra> Of course. But I think we should re-evaluate romantic relationships completely as well.
[01:43:06] <twb> "stairway to heaven" is just "working on a sex farm" in another key
[01:43:13] <RedCrab> lall-: if glorification of simplistic ideas is a problem, do you have the same feeling about Anthony Bourdain, Jamie Oliver, or Gordon Ramsey?
[01:43:20] <TimMc> I do have a problem with objectification -- not "look at this sexy person", but "this person is only good for being sexy"
[01:43:35] <lall-> you can't say that anthony bourdain is doing same as this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0vFid2tKbI
[01:43:45] <RedCrab> Again, can't watch any videos
[01:43:45] <lall-> Pitbull - Don't Stop The Party ft. TJR
[01:43:51] <twb> TimMc: well i mean, that's probably the nicest thing you can say about ScoMo
[01:43:54] <lall-> it's apples and oranges
[01:44:18] <RedCrab> "glorification of simplistic things" - this can also be applied to eating, another basic need.
[01:44:23] <onmra> Anthony Bourdain isn't doing anything anymore.
[01:44:23] <TimMc> twb: I have no idea who or what that is (but I'm probably fine staying that way. :-P)
[01:44:31] <twb> He's certainly got no leadership, charisma, human decency, or financial nous
[01:44:47] <twb> so comfort man is about all that's left
[01:44:56] <lall-> twb, talking about what?
[01:44:58] <lall-> bourdain?
[01:45:01] * twb sits down to write a stage play
[01:45:30] <twb> lall-: Scomo runs my country since the queen is too busy
[01:46:11] <lall-> whatever the hell that means. listen mate. i'll tell you who runs your country
[01:46:18] <TimMc> Oh, is this a political figure? I thought it was a celebrity.
[01:46:21] <twb> lall-: murdoch
[01:46:41] <lall-> people that desire other people to be consumer sheep dumbases that have no independent train of thought
[01:46:51] <RedCrab> Scomo sounded like a disease to me. Guess he's a politician? Sounds about the same
[01:48:00] <onmra> Who are those people?
[01:48:02] <lall-> expensively educated politicians that are disconnected from reality in more than one way, and all the entertainment industry is right there to distract common man from thinking of his existance and potential by feeding him garbage
[01:48:37] <RedCrab> I agree with you in the principles, but not in the jugements
[01:48:49] <RedCrab> judgements*
[01:48:55] *** Parts: eXeC64 (~eXeC64@80.1.220.46) (Leaving)
[01:49:22] <RedCrab> judging children is lame. Especially since children haven't had a decent shot at their own life yet (at least in most of the Western world)
[01:49:28] <lall-> well, for god sake, you have mcdonalds, basic thing that people need, food, that's marketed en mass like coca cola to people
[01:49:34] <lall-> no i ain't judging children
[01:49:37] <lall-> i'm judging parents
[01:49:45] <RedCrab> parents that let their children watch Pitbull?
[01:49:46] <lall-> that due to circumstances cannot know any better
[01:50:24] <lall-> happens. my girlfriend thinks its harmless and allg ood fun.
[01:50:52] <twb> RedCrab: I'm mentally thinking "unlike the developing world, where you can make Sergeant by the time you're twelve years old"
[01:50:53] <RedCrab> In all honesty, I'm pretty sure they'll be fine until they start to turn 13 and start listening to the lyrics
[01:51:21] <RedCrab> twb: I mean... could be?
[01:51:37] <lall-> that's what i count on. by the time they're teenage, they will wade through all the bullshit and figure things on their own and figure what matters and what not.
[01:51:45] <lall-> as a father.
[01:51:52] <RedCrab> I remember reading a BBC article where a gang of children (probably 13 years old) were carrying AKs
[01:52:10] <TimMc> RedCrab: Michigan, maybe?
[01:52:13] <RedCrab> ha!
[01:52:13] <twb> RedCrab: that's almost certainly a lie
[01:52:28] <twb> RedCrab: much more likely to be AKM or Norinco AKM clones
[01:52:47] <RedCrab> ha! I don't know much about guns, so I'm not sure on the exact models, or even brands
[01:52:48] <lall-> i'm sure it happens somewhere. you don't have to look at that, look at western world, specifically US, and all the shootings that happen
[01:53:08] <TimMc> twb: Phew, that sounds like a much healthier situation.
[01:53:21] <lall-> i'm not saying i have the answers, but fuck me... there's a psychological issue going on
[01:53:31] <RedCrab> If I'm going to get shot, I'd much rather it be with an AKM clone
[01:53:38] <lall-> and the answer from the modern world, is ... ritalin
[01:53:42] <TimMc> at least if it's by a 13 year old
[01:53:48] <RedCrab> exactly
[01:54:18] <RedCrab> lall-: I'm not going to tell you how to raise your children, just that if you feel the world is going to hell (like every parent from every generation), do the best you can for your kids
[01:54:18] <twb> AK is from 1947 and fires WWII 3-line cartridge; AKM is from 1974 and fires a 2-line cartridge (so ~50% lighter)
[01:54:29] <TimMc> lall-: Ritalin really helped me. I don't need it anymore, but it was what I needed at the time.
[01:55:05] <TimMc> (better schools would have helped too, don't get me wrong)
[01:55:09] <RedCrab> I'm pretty sure my childhood issues were caused by ADHD. I never have gotten diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure some form of Ritalin may have actually benefited me, as well
[01:55:35] <twb> Norinco is mainland China's weapons factory
[01:55:37] <lall-> well i do the best i can, in the end... i know i'm gonna fuck them up, same as mine did me, but hey, it's progression. as long as they are incrementally better than me, i will be happy... but i started this convo about shitty music
[01:55:47] <TimMc> twb: I guess that makes sense -- kids can only carry so much weight.
[01:55:57] <RedCrab> pushing drugs without proper diagnosis is stupid, but so is taking them away from children who may need them, or stigmatizing their use in cases where it's appropriate
[01:56:27] <twb> yeah you're looking at maybe 6kg instead of 15kg I guess, including ammo and mags
[01:56:37] <twb> less recoil also
[01:56:52] <twb> but really just there's like 20 million AKMs
[01:56:56] <TimMc> ...now I want to find videos of kids at a range trying to shoot high-recoil guns.
[01:57:02] <RedCrab> lall-: good luck! Since it sounds like your gf may have different ideas than you on ... potentially many things, maybe it'd be good for you two to talk about planning for when your kids are older so issues are handled before they crop up
[01:57:04] <lall-> few decades ago, twats were pushing this idea that young ones kill each other because of video games
[01:57:09] <TimMc> just all going end over end in the air
[01:57:15] <twb> it's the flying pigeon of firearms
[01:57:39] <TimMc> twb: By that expression do you mean it's really common?
[01:58:01] <twb> TimMc: flying pigeon is a vehicle that has more units made than like.. all other vehicles put together
[01:58:10] <TimMc> ah
[01:58:20] <lall-> RedCrab, there are things i can say that wouldnt be popular opinion...and im not talking about my kids, although mybe i am
[01:58:32] <lall-> and this is it: not everybody deservers to ba saved

[01:59:28] <RedCrab> the unpopular part would probably be agreeing on who is actually "deserving" of saving 
[01:59:50] <twb> Or... OK ignore me
[01:59:50] <lall-> well look at this covid thing now, a friend on facebook posted a picture recently of his girl eatinga a donut... and washing it down with sprite....

[02:00:02] <twb> forgetting all my gun nerd facts

[02:00:18] <RedCrab> twb: you know you want to stay up!
[02:00:27] <RedCrab> the longer you stay up, the more tired you'll be for bed. The faster it will be to get to sleep

[02:00:30] <twb> well I did just buy a terrible alarm fuer cobra 11 game
[02:00:41] <onmra> Donuts are shaped like O and there is an O in COVID.
[02:00:50] <RedCrab> bullet proof logic
[02:00:55] <onmra> Sprite sounds almost like spread.
[02:00:57] <twb> you can't drink sprites anyway
[02:01:12] <lall-> stuffing yourself with sugar and getting diabetes certainly is not going to help your immune system fight off a disease
[02:01:16] <RedCrab> "do nut sprite covid"
[02:01:25] <raccoon_dog> Yeah. You drink Sprites -- capital S.
[02:01:28] <lall-> personl responsibility
[02:01:58] <RedCrab> That's ... true. Being diabetic does not help your immute system fight off a disease (although COVID is a virus). But stubbing your toe also doesn't help you throw horse shoes around a metal pole
[02:02:50] <lall-> what does that last part mean 
[02:03:06] <TimMc> It means that you're making nonsequiturs.
[02:03:10] <RedCrab> ^
[02:03:30] <lall-> how so?
[02:03:56] <raccoon_dog> I think the standard spelling is "non sequitur."
[02:04:02] <raccoon_dog> (Two words.)
[02:04:45] <RedCrab> I had an old girlfriend who was a non sequitur, she told me it due to dehydration
[02:04:55] <lall-> listen mate... i'm skipping breakfast every dayt, and instead, i'm sprinting on the sun every day, ine ffort to enhance my immune system. i eat a lot of veggies, and good quality food.... and then there's a bloke that for 30 years didn't do anything than drink sprite and eat donuts

[02:06:30] <RedCrab> Number 1. it's good that you're taking care of your health. 2. Caring about others around you is a great thing that I wish a lot of others did. 3. If you get your COVID shot, you probably don't have to worry about the dumbasses. 4. There are a lot of dumbasses. It'll get tired being angry at all of them (You'll just be angry all the time)
[02:07:08] <RedCrab> Although, really, you should be eating breakfast every day. 
[02:07:09] <lall-> just saying that one has to take care of himself before thinking of vaccinees or anything else. and not drink sprite every day.
[02:07:37] <TimMc> raccoon_dog: I think the missing space was a typo, heh.
[02:07:43] <RedCrab> I don't think those 2 things are mutually exclusive. You can both take care of yourself and equally think of vaccines
[02:08:05] <RedCrab> Unless you're saying you'd rather go for a morning jog than get the COVID shot?
[02:08:06] <lall-> sure. the person that i was mentioning (the sprite thing) did not do that, but you can, sure.
[02:09:07] <lall-> no, i think first is necessary
[02:09:12] <RedCrab> Viruses and bacteria don't care too much how healthy you feel. And your immunity doesn't exactly kill or deal with all viruses (I mean... how healthy do you have to be to be able to fight off HIV). 
[02:09:40] <lall-> they do really
[02:09:58] <RedCrab> I would say getting the COVID shot is actually more important than health. This is why the elderly were placed first, as they are frailer and more likely to have poorer health 
[02:10:24] <RedCrab> lall-: wait, so you're saying people who got HIV and didn't have their body fight it off are just not "healthy enough" to fight it off alone?
[02:10:26] <lall-> and i agree
[02:10:44] <lall-> nope
[02:11:05] <lall-> i say that number one, regardless of conddition is ... striving to be healthy by exercise and proper diet

[02:12:39] <RedCrab> lall-: so what's the timeline of going from morbid to healthy compared to signing up for a COVID shot and getting it?
[02:12:52] <lall-> easier to get covid shot.
[02:12:57] <RedCrab> and faster
[02:13:05] <onmra> And more effective.
[02:13:12] <lall-> my friend, that i mentioned, earlier, did not have thta luck... he died before the vacciness became mainstream.
[02:13:19] <RedCrab> and timeline allows for less opportunity to catch COVID between start and finish
[02:13:36] <lall-> he was a postman.
[02:15:08] <twb> how can a postman be obese
[02:15:18] <twb> the job literally involves walking
[02:15:36] <lall-> he rode a motorbike.
[02:15:42] <RedCrab> So is a Postman the same as a MtF person?
[02:15:44] <lall-> this turned out to be a joke
[02:15:44] <twb> oy
[02:16:25] <twb> RedCrab: no
[02:16:37] <twb> RedCrab: in american it's probably called a "mailman"
[02:16:52] <lall-> mailman.
[02:17:07] <lall-> either way, the bloke died.... he was 1.60cm, and 120 kg
[02:17:12] <lall-> never took care of himself
[02:17:16] <RedCrab> I think the current trending term is "mail person", or "hu-person that delivers envelopes" (so as to avoid the term "man" or even "mail" [sic]
[02:18:33] <RedCrab> I don't know normal metrics of measurement too well, only old, hand me down units we know in America. But I know 1.6cm is probably around 5'5" and 120kg sounds like an awful lot
[02:18:42] <lall-> obese.
[02:19:33] <lall-> it's covid that killed him but just because he never cared to do anything to advance his health.... so i cried, because, eh.. humans are emotional
[02:19:40] <lall-> but i don't expect the whole planet to lock down because of it
[02:20:17] <lall-> thank god we're scientifically advanced enough that we came with mRNA vacciness, and all others that will minimize these tragedies
[02:20:24] <lall-> but still, sprite and donuts ain't helping.
[02:21:16] <lall-> and that's wht i said, personal responsibility first.
[02:21:24] <RedCrab> I care a lot about humanity, but at the same time see that a lot of stupid people are willfully ignorant, even to their own detriment - and even to the detriment of others that are affected by their actions and inactions
[02:22:26] <RedCrab> it can be a hard line to tap dance around: when to let people live their own stupid life, and when to slap them because their stupidity is seeping out onto others
[02:23:31] <lall-> it's a slippery slope
[02:24:00] <lall-> there are many people that eg, are against vaccines nowdays... mostly anti-vaxers but i'm not thinking about those
[02:24:34] <lall-> 6-7 months ago, many intellectuals were vary of the vaccine not becaue thery are anti-vaxxers but because the vaccine was untested
[02:25:14] <lall-> what happened, astra-zenneca ... a bunch of cases with blood clots. granted, you're still better off being vaccinated
[02:25:49] <lall-> but i just hate when poeple label other people as dumb because they don't want to be test subjects and they would rather test ther luck
[02:26:01] <RedCrab> and I'm not sure I can get behind onmra's idea of forced sterilization of people that fail to learn how to properly put on a mask or button their shirt the correct way. Although it's tempting
[02:26:26] <lall-> is it
[02:27:01] <onmra> When did I suggest that? What?
[02:27:08] *** Joins: milosz (~milosz@user/milosz)
[02:27:12] <lall-> yeah. i didn't see that either.
[02:27:23] <onmra> Did anyone suggest that? Haha
[02:27:31] <lall-> apparently tou did mate.
[02:27:38] <lall-> you're hitler.
[02:28:17] <lall-> onmra was watcing mr.bean
[02:28:31] <lall-> and all the sudden he's of the idea of forced sterilization
[02:29:04] <tinwhiskers> I think higher insurance premiums, no access to public schools, restricted travel, restricted attendance at crowded events should be enough of a penalty without needing to sterilise them
[02:29:38] <lall-> well you would like chinese social credit system then. these things tend to get out of control
[02:29:44] <tinwhiskers> but if they all disappeared I think it would be a net improvement
[02:30:27] <RedCrab> Ah, sorry. I think I misinterpreted your comment above, "...But I think we should re-evaluate romantic relationships completely as well." as forced sterilization. My mistake
[02:30:40] <RedCrab> it's an easy one to make, you understand
[02:30:54] <onmra> We should find an uninhabited island and "reward" them with a free holiday.
[02:31:08] <lall-> i'm not an american, nor do i undestand yanks... but ... i do feel like openness and guarantee of freedom of choice, will and speech is something that ultimately pushes us forward
[02:31:24] <lall-> and americans...have that nailed down.
[02:31:29] <tinwhiskers> yes, you are free to make the choice but not free from the consequences of that choice
[02:31:46] <RedCrab> I feel STDs are a good indicator of facing the consequences
[02:32:04] <onmra> I wasn't really following the conversation in depth. That was just in response to you mentioning cheating.
[02:32:14] <lall-> reason why US is at the front of tech innovation is because of that, so there's your consequence
[02:32:50] <tinwhiskers> bold claim
[02:32:57] <lall-> oh is it really
[02:33:13] <lall-> while the chinese are imprisoning uyighurs, steve jobs was making an iphone
[02:33:26] <lall-> in China :)
[02:33:35] <tinwhiskers> it's not clear that the freedom aspect is why they are on the cutting edge
[02:33:45] <tinwhiskers> (were)
[02:33:52] <RedCrab> lall-: we are definitely a big center of tech innovation, but CERN and other equivalent also show that Europe has good centers for promoting technology and sciences
[02:33:54] <lall-> openness, and liberalism
[02:33:58] <lall-> like open source
[02:34:12] <lall-> vs... communism and authoritainism
[02:34:37] <RedCrab> I think it's more complicated than that
[02:34:39] <lall-> show me one good thing that came out of china
[02:34:41] <tinwhiskers> right
[02:34:46] <RedCrab> there was very good technology that came out of the USSR
[02:34:51] <lall-> and i'll show you 20 that came out of US.
[02:35:01] <tinwhiskers> and Japan, Germany, etc. 
[02:35:29] <lall-> yeah, this what came out of japan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731
[02:35:30] <tinwhiskers> yes, they are very big
[02:35:38] <onmra> Have you seen that meme going around that shows an iPhone and like all the technology used in it was developed in the public sector?
[02:36:04] <RedCrab> lall-: that's a red herring to the subject
[02:36:10] <lall-> it was. sorry.
[02:36:31] <tinwhiskers> I mean, strict authoritarian govt will do harm in that regard so may explain why china performed poorly, but many countries have effectively the same freedoms as the USA, but size becomes important then
[02:36:47] <RedCrab> it's like saying "China is better because USA had leaders that forced the native population to relocate/die" etc etc
[02:37:24] <lall-> i was saying that the US gov to all its faults, or any other western gov never did anything as bad as what Chinese are doing now (in the 21st century)
[02:37:32] <tinwhiskers> so it's not the freedom in the US that is responsible, but that's a likely requirement
[02:37:35] <lall-> i'm not saying that Chinese people ar to blame, but their ideology
[02:37:45] <tinwhiskers> sure
[02:38:08] <onmra> No western government ever? Hmm...
[02:38:11] <tinwhiskers> there is not sufficient difference in freedom between first world countries to explain the difference in economic activity seen in the US
[02:38:22] <RedCrab> USA is very good for innovation and new ideas. Europe is also good for innovation and a lot of theory (where USA I feel is good at the practical application). China is good for manufacturing and being efficient. Japan is good at improving upon ideas in new and innovative ways. Each country has their own (general) benefits, and it's great that we can take advantage of all of them and reap the
[02:38:24] <RedCrab> rewards, rather than having to live in that country to only see the benefit
[02:39:14] <lall-> why is the eur and the us good at inovation? because of openness and freedom and allowing everybody to participate
[02:39:22] <lall-> well it was
[02:39:33] <tinwhiskers> that's part of it, sure.
[02:39:41] <tinwhiskers> as in lacking freedom would harm it
[02:39:53] <tinwhiskers> but it doesn't explain it
[02:40:24] <lall-> what do you mean it doesn't explain it
[02:40:25] <lall-> what does
[02:40:32] <lall-> why do the chinese just steal IP
[02:40:44] <RedCrab> because they can and get away with it
[02:40:45] <lall-> they have literally nothing of their own
[02:40:51] <tinwhiskers> freedom alone doesn't explain why some countries are technological powerhouses
[02:40:56] <RedCrab> lall-: that's not exactly true
[02:40:56] <lall-> everything they have is a poor copy of what west invented
[02:41:07] <tinwhiskers> lacking freedom will harm that progress but doesn't explain it
[02:41:54] <RedCrab> the next time you eat spaghetti, you can thank the people who brought it over to Italy from China. The next time you shoot your AK gun, you can thank China for the gunpowder while you reload.
[02:42:07] <RedCrab> There is a difference between governments (PRC) and cultures (Chinese)
[02:42:21] <tinwhiskers> AK doesn't use gun powder. it's not remotely similar.
[02:42:30] <RedCrab> Thank you. I know nothing about guns
[02:42:31] <tinwhiskers> nitrocellulose, presumably
[02:42:55] <lall-> 4 years ago, i was on the airplane, the ci=hinese guy next to me was spitting on the floor.... i told him, dude... stop that go to tilet, he didn;t understand and he continued spitting
[02:43:02] <lall-> sure, this is one isolated case
[02:43:03] <tinwhiskers> (no modern rifles use gun powder - its filthy and corrosive)
[02:43:13] *** Quits: FightingFalcon (~sdasavcsg@user/fightingfalcon) ()
[02:43:25] <lall-> but i can tell you 6 more stories like this
[02:43:36] <lall-> and none of them re their fault relly
[02:43:39] <RedCrab> Hell, technically there are still 2 Chinas, and like 90 something ethnicities in China that we would all just lump as "Chinese" because most Westerners can't tell
[02:44:17] <lall-> RedCrab, doesn'thave internet. tinwhiskers does... here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0bNf-jcVU0
[02:44:23] <twb> you can't tell uyghur from han?
[02:44:34] <tinwhiskers> what is this link?
[02:44:48] <lall-> jeremy clarkson talking about china, in china.
[02:44:54] <tinwhiskers> meh
[02:45:01] <lall-> about theft of IP, without talkng about theft of ip
[02:45:24] <tinwhiskers> tldr; "some cultures are different and I don't like that"
[02:45:30] <lall-> no it's not that
[02:45:59] <lall-> it's when you have starcoffee, subhey, and mcchina
[02:46:21] <tinwhiskers> you don't think that's related to cultural differences?
[02:46:28] <lall-> idon't know why people thinkg every time you judge a theft
[02:46:34] <lall-> people think it's one hating on the culture
[02:46:57] <lall-> well no mate, if you come up with idea of iphone, nd i steal that and make "vivo"
[02:47:02] <twb> eyeroll
[02:47:05] <lall-> i think that's not fair
[02:47:16] <twb> this is about the time you accuse china of kidnapping farmers on the border right
[02:47:35] <lall-> no, again, you're reading what you want to read
[02:47:36] <tinwhiskers> like, I can't stand eating near many asians who eat with their mouth open. I find that pretty disgusting and wonder how they can do it, but in their culture it's actually a sign of politeness to make a bit of noise when eating because it signals you are enjoying the meal.
[02:48:16] <lall-> not at all buddy.
[02:48:37] <twb> tinwhiskers: when I was little I thought japanese people could eat awhole bowl of noodles in one go, because they did that in anime
[02:48:40] <lall-> i'm married to half chinese, half thai... and my kids are asian...
[02:48:50] <twb> tinwhiskers: I thought there must be some technique I didn't know
[02:48:53] <lall-> if you want me to go on about faults of caucassians i will
[02:48:55] <tinwhiskers> heh

[03:12:48] <raccoon_dog> The other mosquito disease.
[03:13:05] <lall-> most likely because of masks and social distancing which here is takedn religiously.

[03:19:28] <tinwhiskers> the current special tourist visa lasts 9 months anyway, so it's not as bad as Vietnam, needing every 3 months.
[03:20:23] <lall-> you talking about setv?
[03:20:41] <tinwhiskers> umm... don't think so.
[03:20:57] <tinwhiskers> yes, STV
[03:21:23] <lall-> yeah, thats a new thing. i haven't used that, but yeah thats kind of a long term tourist visa
[03:21:29] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[03:21:45] <tinwhiskers> in Vietnam that always involves a border run, but how that will work with covid quarantine is as-yet unknown
[03:22:12] <lall-> as of now, in thailand, you can't do border runs... so what you get from visa, is what you have
[03:22:18] <lall-> which is offputting for many people
[03:22:20] <tinwhiskers> since Thailand has STV available now I'm thinking I may go there instead, and maybe on to Vietnam when things settle

[08:04:03] <raccoon_dog> No, the for/four/fore one isn't universal. There's a thing known as the horse–hoarse merger, and not every English speaker has that.
[08:04:29] <raccoon_dog> Much like how Mary, merry and marry aren't always pronounced the same.

[08:07:24] <itsmemoria> they do list "for, fore, four" but these are called multinyms instead of homophones 
[08:07:31] <raccoon_dog> itsmemoria: Note how "advice" and "advise" aren't there, because they're actually not pronounced the same way.
[08:08:07] <raccoon_dog> itsmemoria: Well, the for/four/fore is a bit trickier. Most contemporary, modern dialects of English do exhibit the horse–hoarse merger, so they would be, in effect, homophones in those dialects.
[08:09:44] <itsmemoria> Oh I see thanks for sharing

[15:45:03] <kompowiec> hi
[15:45:06] <Voxel> Is it correct to say "You might also like setting the sort type..."
[15:45:20] <flareon> Voxel: Yes.
[15:45:24] <Voxel> Thank you very much ^^
[15:45:33] <Voxel> I thought it should be "You might also like to set"
[15:45:54] <flareon> Voxel: That's also correct.
[15:46:01] <Voxel> I don't really get when sometimes it's "to something" and "toing"
[15:46:43] <flareon> Voxel: The -ing is the gerund. It's told you should avoid it but it's alright.
[15:46:47] <Voxel> I mean, it's either `V to V to V` or `Ving Ving Ving`

[16:11:21] <flareon> Voxel: India?
[16:11:54] <Voxel> Like, literally meagre. Oh dear... Here one software developer gets US$5,736/y or US$478/m for their development which also includes: Web(Back-end(ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, PHP, NodeJS, Golang etc.), Front-end(JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Frameworks(Angular, AngularJS, SCSS etc.))) - Full-stack, API(REST, SOUP etc.), Desktop(.NET, .NET Core, Java

Different templates/schemes(MVC, MVVM etc.), Security(OAuth, OpenID Connect, Sign

[16:12:04] <Voxel> People just freaking survive here for nothing.
[16:12:09] <flareon> Voxel: But I don't know if IRC is even popular in India, though.
[16:12:38] <Voxel> I completely abhor that country while working for the government as a software developer.
[16:13:30] <flareon> Voxel: I'm sure people in your country survive on less.
[16:13:52] <Voxel> What do you mean?
[16:14:27] <flareon> Voxel: there would be people who survive with less money in your country, i mean.
[16:14:43] <Voxel> Yes, and what that suppose to mean?

[16:16:58] <huf> there are starving kids in africa
[16:17:01] <Voxel> flareon, then don't be rude, too.

[16:30:03] <Voxel> Have you seen recent Steam summer sales?
[16:30:28] <Voxel> So many went on sale oh dear. I bought 2 masterpieces ^^
[16:31:32] <Voxel> While knowing the art is priceless... I usually try to buy these at full price knowing how the development is hard.
[16:32:05] <blkshp> I wouldn't know the difference between a Rembrant and a Remmington
[16:33:11] <Voxel> It's always was questionable to me how a person may say something like "This game doesn't worth $99". I mean, how do you even know? The price? It's so tremendously tiny compared to the resources included into such masterpieces...
[16:33:16] <Voxel> "...Can I do that myself? How much would that cost to me? How much time? How many lives?..."
[16:33:31] <flareon> what did you buy?
[16:33:34] <blkshp> s/doesn't/isn't/
[16:33:34] <tinsoldier> No matches found
[16:33:38] <Voxel> Creating/developing such masterpieces is a freaking astronomically tremendously complicated process which includes magnitudes of various subjects starting from a pixel to national tolerance and more...
[16:35:43] <flareon> the value of a product is only what people are willing to pay for it. it doesn't matter how much *work* went into it.
[16:35:57] <flareon> case in point: Apple.
[16:36:13] <Voxel> I disagree with that, sorry.
[16:37:08] <flareon> you're free to disagree. but unless you're a communist, i sincerely doubt you have thought seriously about that.
[16:37:27] <Voxel> Perhaps, only a developer may realize the hardness of creating such masterpieces and IMHO such prices are way too tiny... It's like nearly nothing comparing to years of development involving multiple aspects and education...
[16:37:42] <Voxel> I mean... it's  -40, -65% or -77% (bundles) and... is that even a price? Just released... People still don't like them...
[16:38:54] <Voxel> So... myopic...
[16:39:15] <LuisM14> o.o
[16:39:17] <flareon> it doesn't matter. the money you pay for the game rarely goes to the developers. they are fired as soon as the game is done. or if not, they are paid starving wages and overworked to death. this is especially true in the gaming industry. if you truly want to help a developer, buy some indie game or donate to something open source.
[16:39:39] <Voxel> Are you a software or game developer, flareon?
[16:40:42] <flareon> i've worked in the software industry but my point is not dependent on that fact. it's a fact universally well-known. do you want some links?
[16:41:02] <Voxel> Links to what?
[16:42:05] <flareon> the fact i just described, it's a well-known phenomenon in the gaming industry. 
[16:42:10] <Voxel> What fact?
[16:42:22] <Voxel> Fact that most people are uneducated?
[16:42:50] <flareon> developers are massively underpaid and overburdened. anyone buying an overpriced game is not going to change that.
[16:43:18] <flareon> you would probably only enable their exploitation even more.
[16:43:40] <Voxel> Have you seen average salaries of UK, Switzerland or German developers?
[16:43:50] <Voxel> Some might also say, it's so easy to degrade/humiliate/embarrass/ruin/defame/hate/abhor/negate/decimate... something one built instead of actually helping to solve the issue realizing the work being done behind the scenes... and sometimes, it's an indication of sorrowfulness and ignorance, thus please consider reviewing the issues one more time.
[16:43:51] <Voxel> You might find so much exceptionally riveting in the such astronomically magnificent world... oh dear...

[16:45:06] <Voxel> Oh. So we need to read a paper written by a journalist for a magazine?
[16:45:10] <flareon> i think nytimes has a paywall though.
[16:46:30] <Voxel> And the "underpayment" doesn't change the fact of priceless art and the developers' involvement.
[16:46:51] <Voxel> Thus, I don't really get what do you even mean by merging these
[16:47:47] <flareon> it does mean that you paying $99 for that game is only going to fill the pockets of the managers and would tighten their hold over the developers to exploit them more. only marginally though so you can buy it.
[16:48:58] <Voxel> I say, art is priceless and while the prices are tiny, people still hate them (IMHO due to the lack of knowledge how magnificent the art is, internally... the history... the process...) and you're saying it all doesn't matter. The developers are underpaid and masterpieces are overpriced.
[16:49:06] <Voxel> What does even "overpriced" mean?
[16:50:01] <Voxel> Also... Art is a subjective matter... How would one base on their expectations from subjective matter made by another person?
[16:50:14] <SkunkyLaptop> Voxel: "even" goes after "overpriced"

[17:28:52] <ccp> Jestem gruby, jem tłuszcz?
[17:29:13] <kompowiec> exactly
[17:29:15] <ccp> It looks like both of the proto-Slavic origins are about "coarse" or "thick" 
[17:29:18] <ccp> interesting
[17:29:25] <Voxel> SkunkyLaptop, I'm sorry, but which sentence?
[17:29:38] <SkunkyLaptop> Voxel: you don't have "a" banter.
[17:30:10] <Voxel> Of the "...used as "a" banter"
[17:30:14] <Voxel> I see. Thank you! ^^
[17:30:26] <Voxel> s/Of/Oh./
[17:30:27] <tinsoldier> V​oxel meant: Oh. the "...used as "a" banter"
[17:30:47] <ccp> I think it's interesting how Japanese is rather explicit in its full form, but in casual speech they seem to enjoy making it just as vague and context-dependent as English
[17:31:38] <kompowiec> yeah i hear that despite such an extensive language, they rarely use all of them.
[17:32:28] <ccp> Yeah I thought I was hot stuff over here with pro-drop languages. These guys don't even inflect for the person and they drop the pronoun anyway
[17:33:55] <kompowiec> my native language has something called default subject.
[17:34:19] <kompowiec> An implicit subject is a type of subject that is expressed in a sentence only by grammatical categories encoded in a verb. Therefore, in such a sentence, information about the person, number and type of a verb indicate the characteristics of the subject in a manner analogous to pronouns [2].
[17:42:52] <paulo_> hmm. I don't even know what a perfect tense is
[17:45:33] <paulo_> or participle

[22:04:45] <TechTest> but since it still qualifies for warranty I'll let the experts handle it
[22:05:22] <TimMc> No, you'd want to get access to the coils at the back of the freezer, behind the panel, and see if they're coated over with ice. If so, there are a few possible causes, but it would narrow things down quickly.
[22:05:36] <TechTest> they aren't
[22:05:51] <TimMc> Ah, OK.

[22:07:12] <TechTest> but in that case probably it needs to be replaced
[22:07:26] <TimMc> In ours, the thermostat physically broke, cracked right open! So the power timer was alternating between the compressor and the heater, but the heater was never turning on, since it always "thought" the coils were warm and de-iced. -.-
[22:07:30] <TechTest> not the entire fridge, the blower
[22:08:07] <TechTest> the fridge is 1,5 year old it shouldn't have such issues

[22:19:37] <sv> no, not the way it's usually being used in.
[22:19:37] <TimMc> No, "gay" isn't offensive, in general.
[22:19:45] <sv> but the way i am looking a translation for.
[22:19:56] <Voxel> It's offensive to call that a straight, though
[22:20:02] <TechTest> "fag"?
[22:20:10] <Voxel> "homo"?
[22:20:14] <sv> namely to remark something as lame, uncool, or generally unpopular.
[22:20:17] <sv> no.
[22:20:18] <raccoon_dog> That would be a homophobic slur (the F-word that was just said.)
[22:20:27] <sv> to say something *is* gay.
[22:20:33] <sv> is gay, i know.
[22:20:37] <Voxel> sv, "meh"?
[22:20:43] <TechTest> sv: sorry, but no one knows what you are talking about
[22:20:43] <adler> boring?
[22:20:46] <Voxel> Like, this thing is "meh"

[23:36:13] <lall-> yeah, it does.
[23:36:42] <lall-> every time you fall asleep, you die.
[23:38:13] <adler> nope youre still alive biologically while sleeping
[23:38:30] <raccoon_dog> That isn't "dying." You lose consciousness, but you don't "die."
[23:38:40] <raccoon_dog> Death implies a loss of essential biological functions.
[23:39:44] <lall-> well... apples and oranges really. you loose "self" when you sleep, if i had to explain dying, and ic annot, but the closest thing that makes sense to me would be sleep
[23:39:52] <lall-> it of course is not the same thing
[23:40:14] <lall-> many people say DMT and siilar psychodelic experiences are also experiencing death, ego death.
[23:40:42] <lall-> i never did it, so i dunno... but sleep, damn. i wake up often, it takes me 5 minutes to figure out what the hell is going on.
[23:40:46] <raccoon_dog> That isn't right. For example, people with borderline personality disorder don't have a sense of "self," yet they aren't asleep all the time.
[23:41:00] <bin> raccoon_dog: that's not true
[23:41:09] <bin> people with borderline absolutely do have a sense of self
[23:41:14] <raccoon_dog> bin: Hm, how would you explain BPD, then?
[23:41:18] <adler> lall-, just imagine what you were before birth, nothing. that is what dying like
[23:41:33] <onmra> Maybe you are confusing BPD with dissociation?
[23:41:33] <bin> raccoon_dog: it's a complex personality disorder that can't be simplified to a one-liner like that
[23:42:01] <raccoon_dog> bin: Well, yes -- that was more as a counterargument to what lall- said. Of course a personality disorder in and of itself is much more than that.
[23:42:06] <onmra> Well by this logic plants aren't lliving.
[23:42:06] <bin> but to say that people don't have a sense of self is entirely untrue and also that's not at all the same as ego death
[23:42:25] <raccoon_dog> bin: I see. What is the difference between ego death and not having a sense of self?
[23:42:57] <blkshp> Why is it that someone doesn't prove these phishing mails before they send them...
[23:43:07] <lall-> i did not even say people don't have sense of self, i said they loose it during sleep
[23:43:27] <onmra> What about dreams?
[23:43:41] <blkshp> Oh I can't copy it it's all a picture
[23:43:48] <lall-> well do you in your dreams have a construct of yourself? because i certainly don't
[23:44:37] <lall-> who i am in the waking state, is nowhere near who i am in the dream state, and often... the dream state is totally different than anything that i am or experience in my waking life
[23:44:39] <raccoon_dog> Well, I don't know if it helps, but occasionally, I'm able to realize I am in a dream and then "tell" myself to wake up.
[23:44:52] <raccoon_dog> I don't know if that counts as having a "construct" of yourself.
[23:46:04] <lall-> that does happen ocasionally. like, lucid dreaing and all that, but that's rare. usually its just you loosing consciousness and havign these dream experiences that are "out there", and waking up thining...wtf just happened... ok, gotta go to work it's 7:30 already.
[23:47:39] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, I see. I don't know what the mental difference between having a "lucid dream" and a "regular" dream is, though.
[23:48:27] <blkshp> Anyway...
[23:48:37] <blkshp> Thanks for teaching me the word "Plethora". It means a lot.

[23:49:53] <raccoon_dog> That's an interesting association.
[23:49:57] <lall-> indeed.
[23:50:04] <bin> raccoon_dog: well I'm honestly not aware of any disorders that completely remove the sense of self all the time, there are disorders that put you in a disocciated or fugue state but drug-induced ego death is much more like the universe collapsing into you and the recognitions that all things are one

[23:53:20] <lall-> adler, i said it earlier, i never did it so i don't have personal experience, but i did research a lot, and it would seem that DMT is the thing that completely strips you of self
[23:53:22] <bin> I'm sure there's probably some good info on YouTube also, but the majority is not

[23:53:36] <raccoon_dog> bin: Yeah, I agree. I think that's true of most things on YouTube. :/
[23:53:55] <bin> I think YouTube has done more harm to society than any other platform tbh. Moreso than FB even.
[23:54:11] <raccoon_dog> Durvasula though is a clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology, so a priori, she does seem legit.
[23:54:25] <bin> yeah
[23:54:47] <lall-> and many of the experiences coincide with experiences from monks that dedicated their life to meditation etc.
[23:55:02] <onmra> Somehow medicine attracts a lot of quacks. :P
[23:55:11] <raccoon_dog> Yeah. Science in general does, I think.
[23:55:19] <lall-> science atracts quacks?
[23:55:48] <adler> not the ducks
[23:56:00] <onmra> Maybe but in my experience it's worse for medicine.
[23:56:06] <raccoon_dog> "Quack" as in a faker, a fraud.
[23:56:11] <raccoon_dog> A charlatan, etc.

[23:56:45] <onmra> I mean psychology kinda started out as a pseudoscience even...
[23:56:56] <lall-> well psychology is a soft science so yeah.
[23:57:08] <kompowiec> https://youtu.be/rLfKX7n9ros
[23:57:15] <raccoon_dog> I think over time it's become more rigorous, though.
[23:57:25] <onmra> Yes, it's a lot better now.
[23:57:28] <lall-> it's not "science". there are no objective truths within in i.
[23:57:46] <lall-> but science is not supposed to be ultimate solution to every problem
[23:57:48] <raccoon_dog> That'd be going down a philosophical rabbit hole, though -- what's an "objective truth"?
[23:58:04] <onmra> Despite being a "soft science" it can follow the principles of science.
[23:58:10] <lall-> from scientific perspective, objective truth is measurable facts
[23:58:29] <lall-> and that's a good thing about it, and a bad thing about it. limitation of it.
