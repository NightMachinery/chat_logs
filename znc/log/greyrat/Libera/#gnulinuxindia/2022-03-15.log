[17:58:22] <gtlsgamr> vi
[17:58:25] <gtlsgamr> no i mean
[17:58:36] <gtlsgamr> using vi all the difference is no plugins
[17:58:48] <gtlsgamr> you still get to use the same modal stuff that vim is famous for
[17:59:05] <gtlsgamr> I use vi on a daily basis for my work.. because those legacy systems dont have vim
[17:59:11] <gtlsgamr> but why deliberately use vi?
[17:59:15] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> gtlsgamr: no plugin
[17:59:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> gtlsgamr: good practice
[17:59:31] <gtlsgamr> just use vim withuot plugins then XD
[18:08:17] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> nah
[18:08:21] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> vi is worse
[18:11:26] <mxbl> gtlsgamr: because vim is bloated and doesn't follow the unix philosophy.
[18:11:36] <mxbl> well, only the part of vim that is vi.

[18:51:46] <telegram_1346084> Guys using arch, do you use archlinux-mirror-net-in ?
[18:56:14] <mxbl> gtlsgamr: its plugin system. you can't integrate it with other programs and it doesn't use text streams. same with macros
[18:56:24] <mxbl> not saying you should never use them though
[18:57:54] <mxbl> but e.g. if i wanted to comment out a massive amount of files, i could make a vim macro and only ever use it in vim, while a bash or sed script could be used anywhere 
[18:58:35] <mxbl> and vi uses this by providing shell access
