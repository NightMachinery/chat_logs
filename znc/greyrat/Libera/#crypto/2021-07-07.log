[21:04:18] <MacGyver> That's on the input end.
[21:04:38] <MacGyver> And I don't believe these system calls use different pools, do they?
[21:04:42] *** Server sets mode: +nt 
[21:04:59] <ericonr> despite the name, getentropy reads from a generator, not from the entropy inputs
[21:05:24] <elichai2> So none of those syscalls ever returned actual unprocessed entropy? 
[21:05:36] <ms7821> a modern kernel will put that input into a pool, and use that to continuously reseed a CSPRNG, from which getrandom/getentropy and random/urandom return data
[21:05:39] <MacGyver> Not to my knowledge.
[21:05:42] <MacGyver> Maybe back in the 90s.

[21:06:38] <ms7821> certainly in the 90s, this was cleared up around 2015 iirc
[21:06:52] <ms7821> it was very fraught before then
[21:06:57] <elichai2> 2015 isn't that long ago ðŸ˜…
[21:07:22] <MacGyver> Not really -- there was a (CS)PRNG in use on both calls way longer than that.
[21:07:33] <MacGyver> But the Linux one was a hacky construction that kinda sucked(tm)
[21:08:18] <elichai2> It's amazing how OSs found themselves at the heart of cryptography without any cryptography knowledge 
[21:08:28] <ericonr> fwiw, linux getentropy has always been a wrapper around getrandom
[21:08:37] <ms7821> also the linux one called rdrand on the output as a final step for a full year after that, which was a super sus thing to do 
[21:08:45] <MacGyver> There's a paper floating around testing the linux kernel RNG for certain properties, finding it failed a few of them.
[21:09:04] <MacGyver> They re-tooled it after that.
[21:11:04] <MacGyver> I think it's this one, from 2006: https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/086

[21:20:38] <MacGyver> https://pthree.org/2016/03/08/linux-kernel-csprng-performance/
[21:21:02] <MacGyver> Let's just say that the Linux kernel RNG has for a very long time not been a shining example of good engineering.

[21:28:48] <ms7821> yeah it's always hashed the output, which I guess counts as a CSPRNG
[21:29:25] <MacGyver> Oh there's an update to that 2006 paper from 2012: https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/251
[21:31:53] <MacGyver> From a quick glance at the commit logs, the last big rewrite seems to have happened in 2017 and was zx2c4 (of wireguard and pass fame) making the actual output chacha-based.
[21:34:50] <MacGyver> Ah, and a third paper @ http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/338
