[23:04:02] <hesco> just discovered pandoc today.  I have an existing 300-some line script which wraps a `lynx -dump` invocation to render a text version of an online article.  I want to extend it to produce pdf output that includes working links and rendered images.  What markup format would I want to use for this purpose.  I have toyed some with markdown and wikimedia so far without success.  
[23:29:14] <hesco> UPDATE: no, I am having some success with embedding an image in the output using the `-f markdown` option, but am still unable to get my links to work.  Have tried both this:
[23:30:38] <hesco> [John H. Tucker](https://www.elle.com/author/229583/john-h-tucker/)
[23:30:44] <hesco> and this:
