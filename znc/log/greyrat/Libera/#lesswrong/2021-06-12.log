[02:52:04] <quanticle> Is substack even a thing that you can "browse"? To me, "browsing" Substack seems approximately the same as "browsing" eBay
[02:52:12] <quanticle> Sure, I suppose you can... but why?
[02:53:42] <quanticle> ggreer: You already got your vaccination, right?
[02:53:48] <galambo_> there are some good substacks out there. I dont see the point in using the substack reader. just use rss!
[02:55:21] *** galambo_ is now known as galambo
[03:01:56] <[itchyjunk]> You can browse ebay by category
[03:01:59] <[itchyjunk]> look for things.
[03:02:24] <[itchyjunk]> Discovering writers on substack has to happen externally somehow, no?
[03:02:25] <quanticle> Does anyone actually do that?
[03:02:35] <spxtr> lots of people browse ebay
[03:02:38] <quanticle> Yeah, it's called you build up your audience somewhere else
[03:02:39] <[itchyjunk]> Enough, i assume.
[03:02:44] <quanticle> And then start a substack
[03:02:46] <quanticle> To monetize
[03:02:55] <[itchyjunk]> Sounds like a flaw being presented as feature.
[03:03:09] <galambo> I found a few good substacks. just use google your topics of interest
[03:03:11] <[itchyjunk]> If I am on substack already, why not allow me to look around and find things?
[03:03:31] <quanticle> I've never subscribed to anyone's substack based upon browsing substack. It's always been, "Oh look, this <famous columnist> left <prominent publication> and is now on Substack"
[03:03:42] <[itchyjunk]> Sounds anecdotal.

[03:04:12] <[itchyjunk]> Might work better than their own search function
[03:05:06] <galambo> if you find good substacks please post them here
[03:05:51] <quanticle> Does it have to be substack, specifically? 
[03:06:09] <adiabatty> [itchyjunk]: was "itchyjunk" taken?
[03:06:18] <[itchyjunk]> No.
[03:06:24] <adiabatty> you should take it
[03:06:29] <adiabatty> and make it your own
[03:06:40] <[itchyjunk]> quanticle, no. i am new to substack so was just wondering how it functioned.
[03:06:48] <[itchyjunk]> adiabatty, think i shouldn't hog all the good nicks.
[03:07:03] <quanticle> There's no mystery to Substack. It's just a blogging platform.
[03:07:18] <[itchyjunk]> Blogs generally let you browse
[03:07:24] <[itchyjunk]> At least that's how i remember them
[03:07:28] <quanticle> Asking why Substack doesn't have good browsing functionality is a subset of asking why blogging platforms don't have good browsing functionality.
[03:07:38] <quanticle> Why doesn't Wordpress.com have good browsing functionality?
[03:08:06] <[itchyjunk]> You're presenting it as a subset problem.
[03:08:07] <spxtr> medium tried to have good browsing functionality
[03:08:13] <quanticle> That's because it is
[03:08:18] <galambo> I think they just assume they will get linked from somewhere else or show up on google searches
[03:08:21] <[itchyjunk]> By tying them to a genre of "blogging".
[03:08:29] <quanticle> Yes, that is the correct thing to do
[03:08:33] <[itchyjunk]> But these are independent platform and they would have different features.
[03:08:34] <galambo> I prefer blogrolls for promotion
[03:08:41] <[itchyjunk]> That is what you choose to do.
[03:08:56] <[itchyjunk]> Correctness seems so be your subjective bias.
[03:09:04] <[itchyjunk]> galambo, what's blogroll?
[03:09:18] <[itchyjunk]> spxtr, what failed for medium?
[03:09:20] <quanticle> Did you literally just say... I'm biased in favor of correctness? I can think of no greater compliment :D
[03:09:21] <galambo> [itchyjunk], in your blog you link to blogs you like
[03:09:36] <[itchyjunk]> You're biased towards finding your characterization to be correct.
[03:09:42] <quanticle> Well, that's everyone
[03:09:44] <quanticle> You included
[03:09:49] <[itchyjunk]> galambo, ah I see.
[03:10:01] <spxtr> medium tried to make money and in doing so became a much worse platform
[03:10:03] <[itchyjunk]> You assume it's everyone.
[03:10:06] <[itchyjunk]> We don't know.
[03:10:18] <quanticle> No, I don't assume; there are quite a few studies showing this out
[03:10:22] <[itchyjunk]> spxtr, but substack is also trying to make money.
[03:10:25] <quanticle> Read _Thinking Fast and Slow_
[03:10:31] <quanticle> And Medium... isn't?
[03:10:31] <[itchyjunk]> Studies showing 100% of people do this?
[03:10:40] <quanticle> More or less, yeah
[03:10:47] <galambo> quanticle, arent half the studies quoted in that book incorrect?
[03:10:48] <[itchyjunk]> More than 100% or less than 100%?
[03:10:53] <[itchyjunk]> Seems like shady study.
[03:10:59] <spxtr> [itchyjunk]: very different model though. substack's subscription model makes much more sense than whatever medium was trying
[03:11:00] <quanticle> galambo: Less than half. Just the chapter on priming
[03:11:17] <[itchyjunk]> spxtr, i see
[03:11:56] <saturn2> my guess is substack wants you to think of each substack newsletter as a separate thing, so you don't start to wonder why you have to pay for each one individually instead of getting a package deal
[03:12:42] <[itchyjunk]> that makes sense.
[03:12:45] <galambo> do you guys still think bitcoin is likely to be a long term store of value? I feel there is lots of criticism about it consuming lots of energy. it is becoming almost politically incorrect
[03:13:06] <[itchyjunk]> Bitcoin was/is a good POC.
[03:13:12] <saturn2> "still"?
[03:13:17] <[itchyjunk]> Also the first to have a functional layer 2, no?
[03:13:36] <quanticle> galambo: We literally have #lw-bitcoin for this
[03:13:58] <galambo> quanticle, but there are like 19 people in there
[03:14:06] <galambo> including myself
[03:14:27] <quanticle> Yeah, so why don't you ask the question of the people who have pre-indicated interest in the question rather than spamming the main channel?
[03:14:46] <galambo> its not even featured in the links in this channel
[03:15:01] <quanticle> I fail to see how that's relevant.
[03:16:27] <spxtr> might be worth revisiting if that channel is necessary anymore
[03:16:45] <spxtr> was created because bitcoin discussion was totally crowding out other discussion in here

[04:15:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> The premises of this book review (and/or book?) are very odd
[04:15:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I understand the rhetorical device of "let's temporarily pretend to be dumb and not to know obvious things that everyone knows" but in this case it doesn't seem to make any sense
[04:16:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> The answer to the question is very obvious and it's not clear why there needs to be any further discussion beyond it
[04:16:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (There might be such a reason, but then that reason should be given up front, before launching into attempting to answer these questions to which we had to first pretend not to already know the answers)
[04:17:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If you live at a small school, seeing students in class, in the dorms, in their private lives, at their recreations, sports, and manual work, you can't escape the conclusion that some people are much smarter part of the time than they are at other times. Why? Why should a boy or girl, who under some circumstances is witty, observant, imaginative, analytical, in a word, _intelligent_, come into the class-room and, as if by
[04:17:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  magic, turn into a complete dolt?" ... um yes gosh why would this happen, we certainly have no idea, what could it be
[04:21:21] <nshepperd2> obviously the classroom is cursed
[04:22:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gotta be. Those darn education witches
[04:23:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "All of these failure modes have the same cause. Learning in schools is externally imposed, not intrinsically motivated." ... wow we got there eventually! It's a miracle
[04:25:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Holt never stopped looking for ways to make school incrementally better, but the basic tragedy seems baked into the very concept. We have things we want all children to learn, so we need institutions to teach them." ... do we, though
[04:25:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, maybe we *want* that but do we *need* it)
[04:26:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Holt gives an anecdote of a fifth grader caught sneakily reading a science book when he was supposed to be learning about “Romans in Britain.” By forcing him to put the book away, the teacher traded an hour of high quality science education for an hour of low-quality history education, during which the child is less engaged and will remember less." ... man, this hits close to home
[04:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I remember being yelled at in English class because I was reading by AP Bio textbook
[04:27:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The teacher found it disrespectful! Like I was saying that her class was boring!
[04:27:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, it sure fucking was.
[04:28:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> She was teaching some crap nobody gave a shit about, I wasn't going to learn any of it (and didn't), and I was only there in the first place because the class was required
[04:29:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And this was in a magnet school for smart kids or w/e! Probably in normal schools every class is like this)
[04:29:39] <saturn2> school isn't about learning
[04:29:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, now. I had plenty of classes that *were* about learning
[04:31:03] <saturn2> that means somebody made a mistake
[04:31:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> My Tech classes were very much about learning. In the senior year one we covered the entire Cisco certification curriculum and the final exam was to set up a little network of Cisco routers
[04:31:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Comp Sci, ditto. Absolutely had to learn to code and do Linux shit and so on
[04:32:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the other Tech class semester we each built a PC from parts! That's some real life learning right there
[04:33:25] <nshepperd2> darn, i wish i learned useful life skills in school
[04:33:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Drafting, too! Not *useful* learning, mind you (although the skills I learned there still come in handy today ... for cake-making, of all things), but boy I sure learned to draft schematics and diagrams and use CAD software

[07:24:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> So why the heck are all the links in the latest ACX review broken
[07:24:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're all like this:
[07:25:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/%E2%80%9Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisenaire_rods%E2%80%9D
[07:25:02] <Robomot> Page not found · GitHub Pages
[07:25:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> How does that even happen??
[07:26:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> But speaking of that link ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisenaire_rods )
[07:26:26] <Robomot> Cuisenaire rods - Wikipedia (Cuisenaire rods are mathematics learning aids for students that provide an interactive, hands-on[1] way to explore mathematics and learn mathematical concepts, such as the four basic arithmetical operations, working with fractions and finding divisors.[ …)
[07:26:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> " Cuisenaire, a violin player, taught music as well as arithmetic in the primary school in Thuin. He wondered why children found it easy and enjoyable to pick up a tune and yet found mathematics neither easy nor enjoyable."
[07:26:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, wow, that is the *diametrical opposite* of my experience
[07:27:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which suggests that the actual problem with "teaching arithmetic" or whatever problem this guy thought he was solving with these wooden blocks was ... that some people are good at math and some are bad at math
[07:30:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> "He also notes in passing that computers (“though _only_ if very different from present ones”) might be able to help children clarify their thinking. Well. Tragically and frustratingly, Holt died only three years later, and so he didn’t quite get to see computers become that mixed-age community center he’d envisioned. I was a privileged kid, and when self-schooling I had access to all sorts of resources. But all I
[07:30:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  really needed, back in 2000, was AOL. Technology provides education in attractive snack form and allows special interests to scale."
[07:31:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hah! Back in 2000 all this guy needed was AOL (and I believe him) but *now* all he would need is ... for the internet to return to how it was in 2000, because fucking Facebook sure isn't a "mixed-age community center" or w/e
[07:37:53] <quanticle> So I'm reading about the EA hack, and the Vice write-up says that the hack started when the hacker purchased some Slack authentication cookies on the dark web for $10. My question is: why isn't it a scandal that Slack authentication credentials are so easy to steal, they go on the dark web for $10?
[07:38:25] <quanticle> It just seems weird that everyone's saying, "Oh yeah, they stole the Slack auth cookies for a bunch of users at EA because of course they did"
[07:38:27] <brand0> seems cheap
[07:38:50] <quanticle> Right. It implies that stealing slack auth cookies is so easy there's hardly any money in it
[07:38:54] <brand0> getting slack acces shouldn't have easily led to priv escalation tho
[07:39:35] <quanticle> Agreed, but how did they get the access in the first place? I feel like Slack should be answering some hard questions right now, and instead everyone's treating this like it's 100% EA's fault
[07:40:09] <brand0> it's hard to say, we're missing a lot of information
[07:40:21] <brand0> was it slack API creds? or just a user account? or did they get root account privs?
[07:40:40] <quanticle> They got auth cookies, so I'm assuming bearer tokens
[07:40:55] <quanticle> Which allowed the attackers to impersonate the employee on EA's internal Slack
[07:41:26] <brand0> gotcha
[07:41:56] <quanticle> They then contacted IT and social engineered them into a password reset, which then gave the attacker full access to everything that the employee had access to. They then levereaged this access to set up a VM inside EA's network, and then did the usual things to move laterally and escalate privs.
[07:41:59] <brand0> yeah i agree with you though, there's nothing in slack that will alert you to a strange auth
[07:42:15] <brand0> like if that had happened to a dev's google acct, the person would have got a notification most likely
[07:42:40] <quanticle> Right
[07:42:59] <quanticle> Yeah, like you said, we're not seeing the full story
[07:43:03] <brand0> slack's auth model is susceptible to this kind of exploitation
[07:43:11] <brand0> probably why it was used
[07:43:43] <quanticle> Yeah, but the fact that there is an active market for Slack credentials means that it's probably not the first time a hack of this nature was carried out
[07:44:02] <quanticle> Which is strange, because this is the first I'm hearing about this
[07:44:23] <brand0> yeah same
[07:44:28] <brand0> but it makes sense the more i think about it
[07:44:52] <brand0> back when i was doing security at my old work, i identified slack as a pretty big vuln for us, but nobody wanted to hear that
[07:45:13] <quanticle> I guess this is the world in which we live. Everyone knows about getting phished via e-mail so whenever they get an e-mail out of the ordinary, they're instantly on guard. But Slack? Slack is chat. Slack is *trusted*.
[07:45:44] <brand0> yeah slack gives people peace of mind
[07:45:56] <brand0> most places still pass creds around on slack like it's no big deal
[07:46:23] <quanticle> It also raises the question of, if you can't trust Slack *and* you can't trust e-mail, then how exactly are you supposed to confirm that the person you're talking to is actually the person they're claiming to be?
[07:47:10] <quanticle> In theory you could call them; in practice, I've never seen a phone directory that was ever fully up to date, especially when it comes to new hires who are most likely to be having problems with auth.
[07:48:00] <brand0> this is why companies set up their own comms channels
[07:48:45] <brand0> lots of ppl i know who use slack, they share creds over signal
[07:48:52] <brand0> people who care about their security
[07:49:20] <quanticle> Keybase chat lol
[07:49:42] <brand0> yeah, people do that too
[07:52:35] <brand0> i don't think the moral of the story here is blame slack or blame EA, but it's that it's very hard to defend against well searched targeted attacks
[07:53:19] <brand0> associated press had a big leak and had to re-do their whole internal auth system last year
[07:54:14] <brand0> so these types of social engineering attacks against orgs are on the rise
[07:57:55] <quanticle> Yeah, I get that; I'm just wondering if there's something additional I can do as a user to prevent my Slack tokens from ending up on sale for $10 on the dark web.
[07:59:27] <brand0> most likely not
[08:00:04] <brand0> using slack requires capital T trust

[08:00:25] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life_ (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[08:01:01] <brand0> I wonder how many people at slack internally have the ability to grab cookies
[08:01:38] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[08:01:58] <brand0> or was it XSS? i don't think there's any details an I incorrect?
[08:02:13] <saturn2> i would guess they're getting them through malware
[08:02:29] <brand0> oh yeah good point
[08:02:37] <brand0> hence the low price it's just passive income
[08:03:11] <saturn2> right, they have a list of every piece of data they can sell and they just scan every computer they can
[08:03:30] <brand0> yeah i don't know why i didn't think of that, but i think you're totally right
[08:03:46] *** Joins: lightdot (~weechat@user/lightdot)
[08:06:38] <quanticle> No details. I'm not even sure that the attacker necessarily would have known how the cookies were obtained. From their perspective, it's just a data dump that they pulled down off a Tor hidden site or something.
[08:12:12] <saturn2> it's probably not a good idea to take any unusual measures to protect your slack credentials. if you get hacked, it's not your fault and could have happened to anyone. but if you're known as the paranoid guy, much more suspicion will be aimed at you
[08:12:38] <saturn2> so it's all downside with no upside
[08:13:55] <brand0> just like any social engineering attack, the solution is to educate users
[08:14:10] <brand0> to not do things like hand out access over chats and whatnot
[08:15:04] <quanticle> Yep. If nothing else, this is good news for ggreer. Yet another reason to use a centralized authentication provider that allows users to do things like change 2FA devices in a self-service fashion.
[08:15:41] <quanticle> The cost for social engineering is much less if IT's response to, "Help I need to add a new 2FA device," is, "Okay, here's a wiki page."
[08:17:39] <quanticle> saturn2: That's true, but I was speaking more from the perspective of, "As a sysadmin, is there something that I should be specifically doing to *all* my users to protect against their Slack credentials getting stolen," and the answer appears to be, "No, not anything other than the anti-malware steps you're already doing."
[08:21:25] <quanticle> Also, I'd seen some discussion of the discussion, but no discussion of the decision: https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-and-gnu-move-official-irc-channels-to-libera-chat-network

[17:53:55] <feep> might be good
[17:54:07] <feep> I'm a bit skeevy on it cause it uses java as the impl language
[17:54:09] <feep> but I guesssss.
[17:54:18] <PapuaHardyNet> btw, the author also wrote "Game Programming Patterns", one of the least painful books to read on code design patterns
[17:54:25] <synthmeat> best professionals i know have the same advice "what books? just do."
[17:54:49] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm
[17:55:09] <feep> go write a forth interpreter
[17:55:09] <PapuaHardyNet> I dislike java, so I'll drop this book
[17:55:11] <feep> always a good start
[17:55:14] <kuudes> yeah, there are not that much demand for new programming languages that it would warrant its own courses at multiple institutions
[17:55:17] <feep> forth is stuuuuuuupidly easy
[17:55:30] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, that's a good idea
[17:55:35] <feep> then write a lisp interpreter
[17:55:38] <feep> lisp is almost as easy

[17:55:44] <feep> but brain-bendy enough to be worthwhile
[17:55:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll try writing an interpreter for forth then
[17:56:02] <feep> yeah you can probably do a forth in like, a page of C or so
[17:56:03] <PapuaHardyNet> lisp is more complicated than forth? that's surprising
[17:56:07] <feep> a little bit
[17:56:16] <PapuaHardyNet> right
[17:56:16] <feep> but yes, forth uses stacks, lisp uses trees

[21:30:17] <dbohdan> Yeah.  I am not sure what "used by animals" is supposed to mean (is it serious?), and I am afraid to ask.
[21:33:12] <dbohdan> I got too curious and asked.  Awaiting a response.
[21:33:41] <PapuaHardyNet> Well, I hope you are thoroughly entertained by interacting with them
[21:34:03] <nshepperd2> perhaps they were sarcastically comparing you to an animal
[21:34:54] <PapuaHardyNet> all the emojis and unicode symbols and the use of an iframe does not make me confident of that outcome though

[22:00:19] <feep[cx]> good linebreak test tho
[22:00:21] <two2thehead> ...
[22:00:33] <two2thehead> kuudes, huh
[22:01:00] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, the study is released under a cc license, so the link is on the page
[22:01:05] <kuudes> "Avatar sexualization had no main effect on women who played the video game The Sims 4, which was supported by additional exploratory Bayesian analysis demonstrating moderate support for the null hypothesis. This result is at odds with previous studies using other games that also manipulated character sexualization in the same game"
[22:01:50] <two2thehead> kuudes, the 'problem' is that iirc self objectification theory has a lot of evidence supporting it, according to my amateur reading of the studies
[22:01:59] <kuudes> this says it is bunk
[22:02:36] <kuudes> which would be supported by the prior "most psych results do not replicate"
[22:02:56] <two2thehead> most non-video game psych results, I should say
[22:03:15] <kuudes> do video game psych results replicate? source?
[22:03:49] <two2thehead> that's my point, I think. Most psych results with self objectification, afaik, replicate
[22:03:58] <two2thehead> but I don't know about video game psych results
[22:04:08] <kuudes> I have not heard of such but just now from you
[22:04:24] <two2thehead> so ceteris paribus, the evidence suggests that the video game psych studies need work
[22:04:31] <two2thehead> okay, that's fair
[22:05:01] <PapuaHardyNet> why would self-objectification lead to lower body satisfaction?
[22:05:32] <PapuaHardyNet> shouldn't it also increase body satisfaction for some people?
[22:05:52] <PapuaHardyNet> that is, specifically for people who consider themselves sexually attractive
[22:05:53] <two2thehead> iirc it positively correlates with lower satisfaction, but I'm not certain
[22:05:53] <feep> I wanna see what the effect is of avatar sexualization on men playing games
[22:06:15] <feep> probably not sims 4, maybe something like fallout?

[22:06:41] <feep> both would be fascinating
[22:06:49] <two2thehead> hmm

[22:07:50] <feep> and hence, in themselves uninteresting.

[22:08:15] <feep> "you can tell stories about lots of people, war veterans, doctors, policemen... women..."
[22:08:23] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I see, women are a deviation from the norm, therefore studies will be done on them
[22:11:03] <two2thehead> here. a good definition/intro to self objectification : 'Objectification theory asserts that self-objectification, which manifests as self-surveillance, leads to increased body shame and subsequent eating pathology.'
[22:11:46] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, I think that should be a good answer to your 'why' question
[22:12:58] <two2thehead> another one. but this time with state as opposed to trait, : https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-010-9745-y

[22:15:14] <dbohdan> feep: "I wanna see if character gender plus objectification has a relation to trans rates"  Do you mean if character sexualization predicts a higher or lower rate of trans?  Obviously, playing as a different-gender character is going to correlate with trans on its own.
[22:18:38] <PapuaHardyNet> this isn't exclusive to women though
[22:19:13] <PapuaHardyNet> wearing a suit, for example, would increase self evaluation
[22:19:43] <PapuaHardyNet> doesn't that mean that self-objectification is common and pervasive?
