[00:10:54] <clr> I'm trying to optimize the use of a large, fast growing repository.  One idea is to centralize repacking and rsync out the resulting pack files.  Once a pack file becomes sufficiently large I thought I would add a .keep file which would cause Git to start accumulating objects in a new file.
[00:11:30] <clr> On top of this I'm hoping to leverage a multi-pack-index file and an associate reachability bitmap.
[00:12:37] <clr> Something I found is that when I run repack on the repo with no additional loose objects and all pack files marked with .keep files repack still wants to go through a long phase of compressing objects.
[00:13:30] <clr> I was expecting `repack -a -d' to not do much of anything if all pack files were "kept".  Wondering what I'm missing?

[00:17:06] <ljharb> cbreak: so, `git diff-files --diff-filter=d --name-only` definitely shows me the uncommitted unstaged files i want. but it a) omits staged files, and b) doesn't list *every file git knows about*, which is what `git ls-files` does
[00:17:59] <ljharb> so i guess what i need is `git ls-files`, but subtracting out anything that shows up in `git diff-files --diff-filter=D --name-only`. is the simplest solution to combine those two?

[01:15:27] <foo> When I do git merge feature-branch, if there's a conflict, the merge goes into a state where I can individually inspect each modification. I *thought* git merge --no-commit feature-branch-name would put me in this same state, regardless of conflicts - but that is apparently not true. Is there a way to force a state before a merge where I can individually inspect all modifications?
[01:23:15] <clr> You should be able to inspect the changes before committing with `--no-commit'.  Are you expecting to see conflict guards around all changes?   e.g. <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>

[01:26:05] <foo> clr: Here's another way to do what I want: 1) from master, git checkout -b staging, 2) in staging, git merge feature-branch, 3) in staging, do git diff master ... this would show me exactly what's different between two branches (especially if one branch is not in sync with master). I can do a similar thing if there's a conflict during a merge with git diff --merged ... I basically want to see what one branch
[01:26:11] <foo> would update in master before I complete the merge. I thought --no-commit would do this but when I ran it it auto merged and committed
[01:26:18] <foo> I might be misunderstanding something here or trying to be too OCD.
[01:28:39] <clr> foo: Did you just run `git diff' ?  Maybe `git diff HEAD' is what you wanted to do?

[01:29:50] <clr> --no-commit will add everything to the index I believe so `git diff' will show nothing if there are no conflicts.
[01:32:13] <foo> clr: first of all, thanks for trying to understand what I'm attempting to communicate. Are you suggesting doing git diff from within master after I do git merge --no-commit feature ? Or B) are you suggesting I do git diff from within a feature branch?
[01:32:47] <foo> clr: actually, in reading the man page again, man git-merge, for --no-commit it says: Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and therefore there is no way to stop those merges with --no-commit.
[01:32:47] <gitinfo> clr: the git-merge manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-merge.html
[01:32:54] <foo> ... that may have been what I saw
[01:33:24] <foo> It sounds like I might want git merge --no-ff --no-commit feature-branch if I wanted to do a git diff --staged to view the differences that are going to be merged in.
[01:33:27] <foo> Does that sound about right?

[01:34:40] <foo> That said: "Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested"
[01:35:01] <foo> Now git status shows me the changes that will be committed. And I can do git diff --staged to see what that is
[01:35:17] <foo> That is exactly what I wanted, thank you man page, and clr for trying to understand my babbling. :)
[01:35:39] <foo> If anyone else sees what I'm doing and has additional commentary, please let me know. Otherwise I assume this is relatively normal. Sometimes I merge in branches and notice issues and want to stop things
[01:36:08] <clr> foo: `git diff HEAD' and `git diff --staged' are basically the same in this case because your working tree and index should match.
[01:36:40] <foo> clr: ah, that's correct. Looks like that produces the same output
[01:37:58] <clr> foo: and that's why `git diff' without any args would show nothing.  by default git-diff compares working tree to the index.

[06:11:41] <wwwi> DoofusCanadensis, I see, thank you.
[06:12:09] <DoofusCanadensis> but the remotes also have the commits before where the files existed
[06:12:29] <DoofusCanadensis> so the files will be recoverable
[06:13:25] <DoofusCanadensis> so the answer is "it depends". what are you trying to do?
[06:14:07] <wwwi> DoofusCanadensis, I was just wondering what would happen under that scenario
