[06:48:55] <cthulchu> good points.
[06:51:06] <KevinX> yeah it's not really overloading. Couldn't think of a better term though. Also I guess it's parameter and not argument too

[07:39:48] <ljharb> cthulchu: for a number of reasons. one is clarity: it's easier to reason about the function, both from outside and inside
[07:40:09] <ljharb> cthulchu: another tho is performance. basically all JS engines massively optimize monomorphic functions, so polymorphic ones are slower.
[07:40:35] <cthulchu> but how would the engine know if it's polymorphic?
[07:40:46] <cthulchu> by analyzing all types passed in to the function/
[07:42:08] <sheetjs> runtime analysis
[07:42:21] <ljharb> cthulchu: yep
[07:42:31] <ljharb> cthulchu: it assumes it's monomorphic and makes it fast, until it's not
[07:42:39] <cthulchu> oooh
[07:43:31] <ljharb> (altho it probably waits for some threshold of calls before assuming that)
[07:44:19] <cthulchu> but even native functions are sometimes polymorphic
[07:45:22] <ljharb> yep
[07:45:25] <cthulchu> like split() can accept a string and a regex. I actually took the idea from it
[07:45:39] <ljharb> but a) native functions are often badly designed, historically; don't use them for inspiration
[07:45:51] <ljharb> and b) the native ones don't need the engine to make assumptions, they know exactly what the code does

[07:54:52] <Maxdamantus> 15:33:30 < cthulchu> even though it looks slightly different than in Java, I think it's still the same.
[07:55:11] <Maxdamantus> It's not really the same in Java, because Java has actual overloading, done statically.
[07:55:30] <Maxdamantus> In JS all you can do is define a single function that decides what to do based on the runtime type.
[07:57:26] <Maxdamantus> eg, if you write this in Java `String foo(Object a) { return "object"; } String foo(String a) { return "string"; } .. foo((Object) "bar");`, you'll get back "object", because the static type of the argument is `Object`, which is used for resolving overloaded methods.

[09:11:14] <theskillwithin> whats pan_eval
[09:12:35] <theskillwithin> is that an IIFE inside there?
[09:12:48] <sheetjs> no

[09:51:02] <blueagain> theskillwithin: I come across that all the time
[09:51:23] <ThePendulum> what's more secure about putting the username and the password on a separate page?
[09:51:51] <blueagain> especially on sign-up pages, where I'm not going to type in a 20-character long password twice. or once
[09:51:51] <sheetjs> its not in the same message, and there's an opportunity to salt the password
[09:51:58] <ThePendulum> in fact isn't that less secure, because it reveals whether an account is registered and not just that either the username or the password are wrong?
[09:52:26] <sheetjs> so say you enter user name -> server sends back a response that includes a key -> you enter a password -> form actually sends f(password, key) on the wire
[09:52:29] <theskillwithin> sheetjs ahh a confirmation box, ok that makes sense,  but still if your using a password manager like you everyone should, then i hope it doesn't break that functionality
[09:52:35] <blueagain> ThePendulum: that's a non-factor, security by obscurity that is
[09:52:55] <blueagain> usernames should be assumed to be known
[09:53:44] <ThePendulum> not really, that can be a privacy concern
[09:53:49] <blueagain> also, you don't really know if the account exists just because the service asks you for a password
[09:54:07] <blueagain> you could check it though by trying to sign up with that account name
[09:54:22] <ThePendulum> they usually won't put you through to the password page
[09:54:44] <blueagain> the reason google and other services ask you for a user first is that not all their auth workflows are password-based
[09:55:41] <buu> Yeah but they're probably checking for parts that aren't the username
[09:55:46] <buu> at least I hope so
[09:55:53] <ThePendulum> that makes more sense
[09:56:36] <blueagain> I don't think it's a security concern though, you know that a certain email address or a phone number has a google account
[09:56:43] <blueagain> security/privacy*
[09:56:49] <blueagain> knowing*
[09:57:40] <blueagain> some things are more alarming, like if you enter a username, then try to recover the password, you could discover what kind of hardware device the user is using
[09:58:03] <ThePendulum> ?
[09:58:31] <blueagain> google usually says what hardware device you use, "please open up your samsung phone and confirm ..."
[09:58:45] <blueagain> and they say the exact device model, at least for me
[09:59:46] <ThePendulum> I guess that's kind of inevitable when you decide to enable that
[10:00:05] <theskillwithin> idk, i mean at least its 2 auth
[10:00:26] <blueagain> it is. they could anonymise that and say "please check your 2-auth device" or just "phone" or tablet
[10:00:27] <ThePendulum> although I guess whatever is identifying that phone to Google could also give you a notification
[10:00:38] <ThePendulum> that'll be fun if you have a dozen of them
[10:00:54] <blueagain> a legit user would know what is the 2-auth device, or *should* know
[10:01:10] <blueagain> a non-legit one is given valuable information for exploit usage
[10:03:08] <theskillwithin> its kind of a paradox, it has to be easy enuff for your parents to figure out,  or else they will have someone turn it off for them
[10:04:19] <blueagain> agreed. it's a trade-off between user-friendliness and security
[10:04:41] <ThePendulum> wouldn't you also still need your regular 2fa device? otherwise how is it still 2fa?
[10:05:45] <blueagain> ThePendulum: this is a special case where you're auth'd on the phone and are trying to recover your password, so google assumes you're a legit actor
[10:06:50] <ThePendulum> why even try to ask for the password then
[10:07:04] <theskillwithin> i used to use a yubi key, but that became annoying,  and then usb-c came out and my yubi key became useless
[10:07:40] <Alex123> hello everyone, do you know where can I find documentation for Document-Level:EmbeddedJS for pdf files, I try to googling it nothing is coming up
[10:08:34] <theskillwithin> pdf files, they are always super fun
[10:09:22] <ThePendulum> one of my first paid projects was parsing pdf invoices into an admin system
[10:10:05] <theskillwithin> i just googled Document-Level:EmbeddedJS and a super sketchy gambling site with the wordpress logo as their favicon showed up as the first result
[10:10:11] <Alex123> I can not even find any docs to tell me what are methods allowed to use in pdf javascript
[10:10:45] <Maxdamantus> It should be okay revealing that information as a second auth factor, but presumably when recovering, you're using that as a first factor, so it shouldn't disclose that information.

[12:45:52] <sheetjs> the tooling is unfortunately not ready for that sort of transition
[12:46:04] <blueagain> are you maintaining it 100% alone?
[12:46:19] <theskillwithin> also the who is still alive
[12:46:45] <blueagain> theskillwithin: I thought the who were several people
[12:46:54] <sheetjs> hired devs help with the paid stuff, but it feels ... exploitative? to ask people to work for free on the open source
[12:47:38] <sheetjs> we typically pay people who contribute demos, not a huge sum but something commensurate with the time spent
[12:49:08] <blueagain> people also benefit from contributing to open source work, they can use it as reference in their portfolio
[12:49:20] <blueagain> and sheetjs is a pretty high-profile product
[12:49:44] <sheetjs> not according to developers at great organizations like facebook
[12:50:34] <sheetjs> "I would just strip the current SheetJS license" -- that dealt a great personal blow and I'd hate for anyone else to be on the receiving end of that
[12:50:54] <blueagain> the company I work at has ~200 people, and we've heard of it, a colleague was looking at it to replace our old excel report generator
[12:51:02] <sheetjs> so no, according to facebook, SheetJS is a project worth stealing from and that is it

[12:52:37] <sheetjs> it was in the react repo of all projects, arguably one of the most high profile open source projects
[12:53:17] <blueagain> it sure sounds like david vs. goliath
[12:54:14] <blueagain> sheetjs: you shouldn't take those things too personally, you're a cool guy as theskillwithin said
[12:54:30] <blueagain> it's just I guess how fb commonly operates

[19:07:20] <ljharb> blueagain: how could anyone not need one
[19:07:32] <ljharb> you need a github account to file issues on the OSS projects that every company uses in 90% of its tech stack
[19:08:01] <ljharb> you also *should* have one to serve as a public portfolio; you can get paid a lot more money and get jobs more easily if you have a github account with activity
[19:08:31] <ljharb> so if you don't have one, you're failing to fix bugs in upstream dependencies of your company's stack; and you're leaving tons of money on the table.

[19:13:52] <ljharb> stenno: i meant that there haven't ever been a "days" where there were *good* countries to give your data to
[19:13:59] <stenno> there is still a social component to gh though, to be fair, and dataminers can create profiles from that

[23:54:56] <han-solo> it would, no ?
[23:55:06] <stenno> oh yes and that was basically a bug, because it was implementing something which wasn't specced
[23:55:27] <stenno> han-solo: if you assume that the code is properly capsulated, then not
[23:55:51] <ljharb> blueagain: right
[23:56:13] <stenno> i.e. that scripts that are executed afterwards have a 'clean' native prototype again
