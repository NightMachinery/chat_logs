[03:31:03] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: no, it's a full native port. Windows (NT codebase/train) was originally developed on non-x86 and ported to x86 to ensure there were no x86 dependancies to make it easily and fully portable

[03:31:22] <Hunterkll> it provides some x86 emulation to run software you bring with you though

[04:41:33] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as thats json anyway
[04:41:36] <Jaelae> i used vRealize automation and just had fields you fill out for everything
[04:41:39] <Kiernian> yeah, that'd be what I'd do, just to cut out the possibility of typos and syntax errors
[04:41:47] <Jaelae> the problem is if you look at this i need to populate esxi host fields. but not by username
[04:41:50] <Jaelae> you need unique identifiers 
[04:42:05] <Jaelae> so first you run a command to get the identifiers, then fill in the fields. so it is understandably, annoying. However, faster than the alternative
[04:42:09] <sd> 11<H​otmess> dsc is powershell

[11:49:58] <lancehead> This is what I'm up to now @ CableNinja
[11:50:05] <lancehead> Ports and stuff changed for obvious reasons
[11:50:29] <CableNinja> good job using sed -i :)
[11:51:13] <lancehead> only thing I'm not happy with is line 35 >_> 
[11:51:37] <CableNinja> you dont need `sudo sh -c 'cp ...'` on line 3. you can just `sudo cp ...`
[11:51:57] <CableNinja> you can clean 35 up easy
[11:51:58] <lancehead> oh you right. thanks 
[11:52:19] <CableNinja> put the individual modules like this: `MODULES="<individual module> <module> <module"`
[11:52:58] <CableNinja> then `for m in ${MODULE}; do echo "blacklist $m" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; done`
[11:53:27] <CableNinja> s/\$\{MODULE\}/${MODULES}/
[11:53:27] <layer8> CableNinja meant: "then `for m in ${MODULES}; do echo "blacklist $m" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; done`"
[11:53:33] <lancehead> Not sure what ya mean there, you have an example for me?
[11:53:39] <CableNinja> sec
[11:53:46] <lancehead> ty :) 
[11:54:49] <CableNinja> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/d6467bf4/
[11:55:17] <CableNinja> and then the MODULES= becomes the list of modules that you're blacklisting, without the `blacklist ` for each of them
[11:55:41] <lancehead> Huh. Nice, thank you 
[11:56:14] <CableNinja> also whats with the EOF on line 73?
[11:57:23] <lancehead> I just realized I missed the tee on line 25 as well, glad I noticed that one 
[11:57:27] <CableNinja> you have another `sudo sh -c` on line 52 you could replace with a sudo tee
[11:57:30] <lancehead> Isn't that how you end a bash script? 
[11:58:14] <CableNinja> `sudo usbguard generate-policy | sudo tee -a /etc/usb...`
[11:58:52] <CableNinja> oh wait remove `-a` from that one

[12:09:38] <CableNinja> ah, well same result, different tool :)
[12:09:49] <lancehead> yep :D 
[12:10:19] <lancehead> Any opinions on the contents of it? I'm doing hardening on a linux box, am stuck on more things to implement 
[12:10:52] <lancehead> Everything is mostly locked down like this I think though 
[12:10:54] <CableNinja> ssh config. disable root login, ssh keys only (if possible)
[12:11:28] <lancehead> Doesn't work for our usecase unfortunately, these need to be somewhat easily accessible over ssh
[12:12:01] <CableNinja> your iptables rules are.... uhm.. weird
[12:12:18] <lancehead> heh, humor me 
[12:12:23] <lancehead> how so 
[12:12:30] <CableNinja> you've got -j DROP's but then you're adding rules to the FORWARD policy after the drop, they will never be reached
[12:12:48] <CableNinja> should set the default policy for the policy to DROP instead of -j DROP'ing like that
[12:13:13] <lancehead> hmm true 
[12:13:23] <CableNinja> also the  comment doesnt match up with the port numbers being configured
[12:13:32] <lancehead> ah fuck 
[12:13:38] <lancehead> i edited those for the pastebin
[12:13:41] <lancehead> forgot the comment...
[12:13:43] <CableNinja> lol
[12:13:45] <lancehead> >_>
[12:14:12] <lancehead> I guess I could move the -j DROPs to the bottom as the other ones are port specific
[12:14:31] <CableNinja> just set the default policy to drop
[12:14:39] <lancehead> eh fair 
[12:15:44] <CableNinja> also, iptables is deprecated / EOL. `nft / nftables` is the new thing. some systems may do the translation for you, but my debian 11 boxes do not have iptables available
[12:16:30] <CableNinja> I actually have to do some reading up on nftables because I've never dealt with it before
[12:17:19] <SirSceptalot> oh my scroll was locked
[12:17:23] <SirSceptalot> morning lancehead 
[12:18:49] <lancehead> CableNinja: These still do, they do automatically translate

[12:19:11] <lancehead> They're Pi's running a custom Raspbian Distro 
[12:19:14] <CableNinja> lancehead, yeah just be aware thats goin away soon :)
[12:19:21] <lancehead> gotcha :D 
[12:19:31] <CableNinja> that still relies on the debian upstream for things
[12:20:24] <lancehead> I don't like nftables anymore, it uses the prefix "nft" 
[12:20:37] <CableNinja> lol yeah I rolled my eyes a bit at that too
[12:20:40] <lancehead> <insert puke emoji>
[12:22:49] <Molnija> i gamed on a 16 core computer yesterday
[12:23:26] <Molnija> i remember when dual core was just coming in
[12:23:38] <lancehead> jeez 
[12:23:46] <Molnija> granted, i was but a bairn
[12:27:44] <CableNinja> too bad a lot of games dont properly utilize all cores
[12:28:13] <CableNinja> a lot of games only work on 1-2 cores max, throwing more cores at a system doesnt do anything for game performance like it should.

[13:01:54] <Molnija> CableNinja: yee
[13:02:11] <Molnija> i use "game" loosely
[13:02:21] <Molnija> i flew a sim.
[13:02:51] <Molnija> performance was substantially identical to my old quad core piledriver.
[13:03:04] <monr0e> Man I remember single core machines, and having to wait thirty seconds a pop to change windows in MSN
[13:03:07] <Molnija> the game is gpu bottlenecked for sure
[13:03:35] <CableNinja> monr0e, or when you tabbed out of game and your messenger had to reload itself from swap
[13:03:43] <CableNinja> watching the window go white and slowly reload itself
[13:03:53] <monr0e> Hah, my laptop couldn't play games and have msn open at the same time
[13:04:15] <monr0e> I tried to play 18wos once. Once.
[13:04:23] <Molnija> you would have sorely appreciated your investment in a 7200rpm hdd ;)
[13:04:28] <lancehead> Oh are we talking about games and bad optimization 
[13:04:38] <monr0e> The shift to my core2duo was insane
[13:05:01] <lancehead> I recently found out Star Citizen's renderer only uses 2 logical processors (out of the 12 I have available) and that when you disable those two, it starts using the other ten 
[13:05:15] <monr0e> lmao what
[13:05:20] <lancehead> yup 
[13:05:22] <lancehead> game engine dumb
[13:05:23] <monr0e> thats terrible
[13:05:42] <lancehead> Yeah lol, straight up makes the difference between 15(!!!)fps and 60-80
[13:05:55] <monr0e> I still maintain a refusal to buy SC until it they stop resetting acccounts every update
[13:06:00] <Molnija> freebsd doesn't let you disable cores, though you can stop it scheduling tasks on them
[13:06:08] <lancehead> They have stopped doing that i think 
[13:06:15] <Molnija> dumb OS design
[13:06:15] <lancehead> But now that there's persistence, they made it so you lose all held items on death 
[13:06:18] <lancehead> :^) 
[13:07:07] <monr0e> Molnija: Not on the fly, but you can edit /boot/loader.conf and disable cores at bot
[13:07:12] <monr0e> https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-hackers/2012-April/038477.html
[13:07:17] <Molnija> yea
[13:07:17] <monr0e> *boot
[13:07:33] <Oliber> wait, people actually try to play star citizen?
[13:07:37] <lancehead> Win10 lets you disable logical processors while running which is nice 
[13:07:41] <lancehead> Like per process 
[13:07:47] <monr0e> I have an internet friend who uses... one of the BSDs. He constantly has problems wuth amdgpu
[13:07:53] <lancehead> Yeah Oliber, I do occasionally. It's not a bad game, just poorly optimized as hell 
[13:08:14] <lancehead> Definitely prefer elite dangerous though but star citizen has better fps combat 
[13:08:26] <monr0e> Star Citizen has some insane features. The trains and elevators having their own persistence model is fantastic
[13:08:55] <monr0e> lancehead: I dunno mayn. I can't tell. ED has an incredible physics engine
[13:08:59] <monr0e> apart from drag in space
[13:09:11] <lancehead> ED has a LOT more fleshed out mechanics 
[13:09:12] <monr0e> FA:off first time was magical
[13:09:26] <lancehead> and the systems in place are super fucking in depth compared to SC 
[13:09:38] <monr0e> Speaking of ED I'm gonna make my way to brestla to fight you at some point. Maybe today
[13:09:41] <lancehead> SC gameplay loop is just "go here, shoot man or ship. occasionally space truck" 
[13:10:50] <Molnija> why is LAN+ so slow?
[13:12:06] <Oliber> i've not played ED for a few years now, i started doing some of the engineering stuff and got bored again
[13:13:18] <monr0e> Yeah I gave up on engineering
[13:13:33] <monr0e> Its the mat grind 
[13:13:40] <monr0e> especially manufactured mats
[13:14:55] <monr0e> I'll stick with my combat python
[13:16:51] <Oliber> i did like the python, it was just a pretty much do everything, until engineering stuff came along and enemy ships could just zoom off
[13:17:48] <monr0e> When they nerfed the python they didn't do it properly, si ti feels very strange to fly now. Still has insane hull na firepower though
[13:18:24] <monr0e> My combat build is based on Rinzler070707's chieftain build. Which I also have
[13:22:15] <lancehead> hehe, I have an engineered mamba with multicannons/beam lasers
[13:22:21] <lancehead> 700m/s of pure death 
[13:24:38] <CableNinja> speaking of games... I was considering buying Cities Skylines, but then after all the cool DLC the damn shit is $160+
[13:25:01] <CableNinja> goddamn DLC moneygrabs >.<
[13:25:29] <monr0e> mamba go bewm
[13:26:25] <monr0e> I also have a federal meme ship. All overcharged lasers. I can fire them for about four seconds before the distributor gives out

[13:29:41] <Oliber> CableNinja: you don't need a lot of the DLC stuff, and some of the DLCs on steam are music only; i think i got it on sale for £50 for most of it a year or so ago (so probably missing 2-3 DLCs)
[13:29:41] <CptLuxx> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOrNBG7sQlE
[13:29:44] <CptLuxx> its the best
[13:29:49] <CptLuxx> they add new stuff all the time for free
[13:30:12] <CableNinja> Oliber, yeah after removing the music DLCs, still over $100+ for the good DLCs (ones with mostly/very positive reviews)
[13:31:43] <CableNinja> monr0e, I tried playin it on the system I had before, I couldnt even get the game to run at more than 10fps with an empty city, so I refunded it. got an updated system now and was considering it, but the amount for DLC is ridiculous
[13:32:13] <CableNinja> I've grown extremely tired of these games who release a half finished game or barely complete game, and then decide to make a money grab by releasing useless DLC and shit

[14:55:11] <csws> ><Kiernian> Do any of you guys have your admins actively log what they're doing when they log into various admin accounts so that there's a task paper trail to go along with any audit trail?
[14:55:17] <csws> old place used cyberark and that'd record the session
[14:55:23] <csws> but nobody would actually review it unless something happened
[14:55:29] <csws> that was only for escalating to domain admin anyway
[14:55:42] <csws> it's not the worst thing in the world. i've heard it has come in handy
[14:56:07] <csws> the admin doing the logging themselves? lol no. how would you trust it anyway?
[14:58:14] <teh_f4ll3n> Joe-Developer, I was thinking roasted veg and cream mash
[14:58:47] <Kiernian> the idea seemingly is that the self-audit could be compared to the actual access logs 
[14:59:18] <Kiernian> which, on it's face, kinda feels like just LOOKING for a way to catch someone screwing up in order to find cause for termination, but it's a hell of a convoluted way to do it, if you ask me
[15:00:05] <csws> man that's dodgy in the extreme
[15:00:08] <csws> imagine if you literally just forgot something
[15:00:18] <teh_f4ll3n> when you can fake access logs, all monitoring seems moot :D
[15:00:21] <Kiernian> so I think there's probably sincerity and not maliciousness going on here, just with a large heaping helping of what technically amounts to ignorance

[15:03:52] <DrZak> i am now a bit sadder
[15:04:04] <csws> idk what if I mount an old backup, steal the dit file from that and go after an admin's password then impersonate them?
[15:04:20] <Kiernian> what's a backup?
[15:04:23] <Kiernian> :P
[15:04:25] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah
[15:04:30] <csws> do you have a half decent EDR on every single server that your admin could conceivably log into with their creds?
[15:04:34] <csws> if not then someone could rip off the hash there too
[15:04:42] <csws> and basically remain undetected
[15:04:45] <Kiernian> yeah
[15:04:46] <teh_f4ll3n> "Fuck it! We're doing it live!"
[15:04:52] <csws> what if your admin uses the same password for his regular AD account as his admin? lol
[15:05:19] <teh_f4ll3n> even I know not to do that
[15:05:28] <teh_f4ll3n> at least add a ! at the end
[15:05:29] <csws> it's a hell of a power move
[15:05:34] <csws> lol
[15:06:03] <Kiernian> just out of curiosity, why would using the same password for both accounts be IN AND OF ITSELF a *particularly* bad thing?
[15:06:32] <Kiernian> like, that seems like a weird thing to call out, so I imagine there's a specific reason for it
[15:06:52] <Kiernian> are account credential hashes stored differently based on account role?
[15:07:13] <teh_f4ll3n> you're using your normal account on a daily basis, if that password gets pinged, at least the admin one has a different password
[15:07:32] <Kiernian> oh, okay. basic shit, nothing special from a technological standpoint
[15:07:53] <csws> Kiernian, NTLM hashes are pretty easy to crack and they'll basically be present wherever you use your account
[15:07:56] <teh_f4ll3n> basic security, yeah
[15:08:10] <Kiernian> right, which is why priveleged access stations, etc

[18:58:45] <vinrock> not a hybrid 4 tho, the new 48v hybrid inline 6
[18:58:49] <Hunterkll> in the fuckin transaction ledger
[18:59:06] <Hunterkll> just affects your balance and lists it on the full statement/cashback history function only
[18:59:13] <estranger> wait its not showing credits?
[18:59:14] <Hunterkll> so i'm always like WTF when i move transactions into my banking software
[18:59:15] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:59:22] <Hunterkll> estranger: oh it applies them, it shows them on the full paper-style statement
[18:59:27] <nx032> does anyone know how to use process monitor to track what permissions an app requires, so that users dont have admin permissions?
[18:59:29] <Hunterkll> just doesn't show it in the transaction list on my credit card
[18:59:31] <SirSceptalot> vinrock, I miss the days when a merc 6.3 AMG was actually a 6.3L (or close enough)
[18:59:44] <estranger> the endless scroll for your account should show credits....
[18:59:47] <Hunterkll> estranger: and this is only cashback rewards redemption, not refunds / etc, those show just fine
[18:59:50] <estranger> Ahhh
[18:59:52] <estranger> gotcha
[19:00:03] <Hunterkll> literally the only thing that's ever annoyed me about this account
[19:00:04] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:00:17] <estranger> do other cards do that? I can suggest it
[19:00:27] <Hunterkll> yea
[19:00:34] <SirSceptalot> vinrock, wtf is up with those weird ass hippies on that picture though?
[19:00:36] <Hunterkll> every card i have shows reward redemption for statement credit as an inline transaction
[19:00:43] <Joe-Developer> 2022 amg sl is ugly man
[19:00:48] <SirSceptalot> AND WHERE DO I FIND THAT HUGE EMPTY TARMAC FIELD

[19:01:20] <estranger> Hunterkll, gotcha!
[19:01:39] <estranger> that should be pretty easy to add in
[19:01:45] <Hunterkll> yea it's a stupid nitpick
[19:01:46] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:02:23] <estranger> guessing those credits might still be on their old system so events arent going to their app streams
[19:02:34] <Joe-Developer> SirSceptalot, nah when the 6.3 AMG was actually a 6.2 was the right era for merc
[19:02:46] <Hunterkll> oh you motherfuckers
[19:02:47] <vinrock> SirSceptalot, lol yeah idk wtf is up with the hipster shit
[19:02:52] <estranger> i like ths RS3 is AWD but you can switch to RWD
[19:02:56] <Hunterkll> estranger: they actually DO show up
[19:03:01] <estranger> Hunterkll, oh haha
[19:03:02] <Hunterkll> i just found the one in my curent cycle
[19:03:08] <SirSceptalot> Joe-Developer, that's what I just said
[19:03:09] <Hunterkll> estranger: they back date it to the date after your last statement
[19:03:13] <SirSceptalot> <SirSceptalot> vinrock, I miss the days when a merc 6.3 AMG was actually a 6.3L (or close enough)
[19:03:15] <estranger> ohh
[19:03:18] <Hunterkll> so a redemption i did on 2/2 shows as posted on 1/22
[19:03:24] <DrZak> but you will eventually cook the central diff if you just have it in rwd
[19:03:30] <Joe-Developer> ah you said close enough
[19:03:37] <Hunterkll> still stupid, but less stupid
[19:03:38] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:03:51] <vinrock> I liked that engine but i prefer forced induction
[19:03:53] <Joe-Developer> many people just go "ItS gOt 63 oN tHe BaCK iTs 6.3l"
[19:04:01] <estranger> DrZak, oh yeah? id only see going to rwd for sporatic fun time
[19:04:02] <vinrock> i have a buddy with one of the older e63's that has the hand built 6.2
[19:04:20] <vinrock> i was gonna get an amg with the 4.0 biturbo but went with the bimmer instead
[19:04:29] <SirSceptalot> yeah but that's how it SHOULD be.
[19:04:52] <vinrock> i do hate how the naming convention makes absolutley no sense now
[19:05:04] <DrZak> e 63 amg had 6208 ccm
[19:05:10] <Joe-Developer> BMW the worst for it
[19:05:15] <Joe-Developer> theirs used to make perfect sense
[19:05:32] <Joe-Developer> still has some sense to it
[19:05:39] <DrZak> i mean, everybody kinda changed it for the old geriatrics to understand
[19:05:41] <vinrock> they all went wacky in the late 90s/early 00's but now theyre just completely meaningless for the most part
[19:05:55] <DrZak> if they had a an e3xx , the current e3xx will be just as fast
[19:06:01] <DrZak> even thought its justa 2 liter
[19:06:01] <DrZak> :D
[19:06:44] <DrZak> its odd considering most countries except germany have such a strcit traffic laws, you are fine with any car that makes around 90-100kw
[19:06:47] <DrZak> :D
[19:06:52] <vinrock> mer 300's are a lil 4 banger, the 450's are a 3.0 inline 6, the amg 63's are a 4.0 v8, the 65's are a 6.0 v12
[19:06:54] <Joe-Developer> like audi are just what the fuuu
[19:07:04] <Joe-Developer> 35TFSI = 1.5l petrol
[19:07:09] <vinrock> yeah audis got HUGE
[19:07:22] <vinrock> with the b8 generation A4 it went to the size of an S6

[19:07:42] <Joe-Developer> LOL
[19:07:57] <Joe-Developer> my mates got an B5 A4

[19:08:21] <Joe-Developer> like a mk4 ford mondeo is about the same size
[19:08:26] <Joe-Developer> B5's are beautys
[19:08:36] <vinrock> B5 A4 is the car that saved Audi in the US market
[19:08:46] <Joe-Developer> however for a passat it's the B6 that's the beauty

[19:21:12] <DrZak> its just outlook
[19:21:36] <DrZak> some colors change, some text fields move, but it all just does the same thing since 05
[19:21:42] <SirSceptalot> *sigh* I'm really going to have to make this lame joke.
[19:21:51] <SirSceptalot> You need to have a more positive outlook on life arlion 
[19:22:48] <arlion> 1) forces conversation mode 2) has focused mode back on even after being turned off again and again 3) its too big! 4) thats what she said 
[19:22:59] <arlion> oh and it removed some of my filters??? por que
[19:23:15] <SirSceptalot> you look better without filters
[19:23:30] <DrZak> but you can set all this things up in a GPO
[19:23:31] <arlion> you are a very positive person, and i thank you for being that person in my life
[19:23:40] <arlion> do i look like a windows admin to you?
[19:23:51] <Joe-Developer> use outlook for web 
[19:23:59] <DrZak> so, you are upset coz you cant use the software properly, and you blame the software?
[19:24:02] <DrZak> :]
[19:24:05] <Hunterkll> daaaamn
[19:24:19] <Hunterkll> "restore defaults"  in vmware workstation's virtual network editor is a fuckin giant hammer
[19:24:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:24:20] <DrZak> of course you can set it without using GPOs, just setting it manually
[19:24:47] <DrZak> did you just break all your lab systems?
[19:24:50] <arlion> The software changed from a working state to a non-working state. That's not me being unwilling to change, thats the software changing around me
[19:25:21] <DrZak> yea, coz things generally tend to evolve 
[19:25:22] <DrZak> :D
[19:25:24] <fritzwastaken> Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh things changed!

[20:43:53] <teh_f4ll3n> hmmm... thanks for reminding
[20:43:54] * teh_f4ll3n runs off to see if Bloodywood released anything new

[20:44:24] <vinrock> ya know what i realied the other day
[20:44:32] <vinrock> i havent heard the confederate flag called the rebel flag in forever

[20:44:40] <vinrock> yase
[20:44:44] <fritzwastaken> :D
[20:44:47] <vinrock> GOTEM
[20:44:54] <PublicWiFi> ehh if you ask someone around here what flag it is they will likely called it the rebel flag
[20:45:09] <PublicWiFi> i actually haven't seen one in person in a long time lol
[20:45:12] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> @vinrock They sure do love the flag of a group that only lasted a few years and got beaten
[20:45:15] <fritzwastaken> I mean, if my wife left me, id prolly have to go gay to find a decent partner. Most woment my age in my area are single moms, insane, or both
[20:45:21] <vinrock> i used to hear the term interchanged regularly
[20:45:28] <teh_f4ll3n> the raycis flag
[20:45:41] <NoxTurminal> Rebel flag is just red neck anarchy flag
[20:45:45] <NoxTurminal> Nothing more 
[20:45:49] <vinrock> feral i spent a lot of time in the deep south and it was treated as more like as southern pride thing
[20:45:50] <teh_f4ll3n> seen it called that on the interwebs
[20:45:58] <fritzwastaken> I mean hell, I see confederate flags in Baltimore County
[20:45:59] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> It's not even the official flag OF the confederacy
[20:46:00] <fritzwastaken> its not uncommon
[20:46:02] <PublicWiFi> yeah in my area it wasn't ever really a racist thing
[20:46:02] <vinrock> i probably seen as many black dudes rockin it as white dudes
[20:46:05] <fritzwastaken> Baltimore is 50% redneck 50% hood
[20:46:08] <PublicWiFi> like vinrock said it was more just southern pride
[20:46:24] <teh_f4ll3n> and 50% hood rednecks
[20:46:39] <vinrock> for as ghetto as baltimore is, theres a lotta real chill people there
[20:46:41] <vinrock> i like it a lot
[20:46:54] <fritzwastaken> Oh hell yea
[20:46:59] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> I mean for a group that wasnt around very much they changed their flag ALOT

[20:47:56] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Alright guys... It's been 6 months... time for a new flag
[20:48:29] <teh_f4ll3n> but history is RAYCIS!!! REEEEE
[20:48:31] <vinrock> every time i see someone bitch and moan about a staue it reminds me of the taliban destroying the famous buddhas
[20:48:36] <PublicWiFi> my grandparents home was built next to a stagecoach road, lots of civil war soldiers came through there
[20:48:54] <vinrock> you should get a metal detector
[20:49:08] <PublicWiFi> yeah they have few trinkets they found in an old cabin on their property
[20:49:11] <teh_f4ll3n> look for tooth crowns
[20:49:15] <PublicWiFi> cups and shit from the war era
[20:49:16] <vinrock> theres a revolutionary war battlefield right near me i wanna search for stuff
[20:49:34] <vinrock> and i think two of the places washington hid out at are nearby
[20:49:57] <PublicWiFi> ther's also hella arrow heads in that area too
[20:50:03] <PublicWiFi> used to find like 1 per day almost
[20:50:21] <teh_f4ll3n> I mean people still dig up German half-tracks and panzers in my home country
[20:50:29] <PublicWiFi> that's dope as fuck
[20:50:33] <vinrock> teh_f4ll3n, i watch a few russian channels that do that
[20:50:37] <vinrock> its fucking insane the stuf they find
[20:50:38] <NoxTurminal> Imagine digging up a tank
[20:50:48] <vinrock> i saw a dude pull a pretty much mind condition MG42 out of a frozen swamp
[20:50:56] <vinrock> i would have busted all the nuts if that was me
[20:50:59] <NoxTurminal> And just cleaning out the diesel system and boom starts uo
[20:51:40] <PublicWiFi> can't kill diesels
[20:51:51] <NoxTurminal> I'd drive that thing to go get groceries be like yeah I dug it up in my yard
[20:51:51] <PublicWiFi> hard to kill an engine that basically uses oil as its fuel lol
[20:52:00] <PublicWiFi> damn things are lubricated from the start
[20:52:04] <NoxTurminal> Yup
[20:52:23] <teh_f4ll3n> NoxTurminal, it'd have to be preserved pretty well with no oxygen access to start up after 80 years
[20:52:34] <vinrock> there are some old russian diesels that are insanely badass and will run forever
[20:52:39] <monr0e> We found a mk9 spit in the north sea a coupe years ago
[20:52:49] <vinrock> i.e., the fuckin monster 38 liter diesel in the MAZ 537
[20:52:50] <PublicWiFi> you can fire up lots of old VW's too after sitting for 50+ uears
[20:52:53] <PublicWiFi> years*
[20:52:53] <fritzwastaken> s/damn things are/a good woman is
[20:52:54] <layer8> PublicWiFi meant: "a good woman is lubricated from the start"
[20:53:00] <NoxTurminal> Ehh I've seen some old John Deere start after 60 year sitting in open fields
[20:53:12] <PublicWiFi> vinrock: -38- liter or 3.8l???
[20:53:17] <vinrock> thirty eight
[20:53:18] <vinrock> !!!
[20:53:20] <PublicWiFi> jesus christ
[20:53:22] <NoxTurminal> Never in the ground but same idea minimal work and it starts
[20:53:28] <PublicWiFi> do they idle at 300 rpm? lmfoa
[20:53:56] <vinrock> MAZ 537: 38.8L D-12A-525A V12 525HP
[20:54:04] <teh_f4ll3n> MAZ 537 is stupid in every way
[20:54:15] <vinrock> thats my favorite truck on earth
[20:54:23] <vinrock> it looks like a monster
[20:54:48] <NoxTurminal> Holy shit
[20:54:53] <vinrock> and 525 hp from an all-motor diesel is bonkers
[20:55:00] <vinrock> it must make retarded amounts of torque
[20:55:06] <NoxTurminal> 38 liters 500hp
[20:55:21] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, stupid powerful
[20:55:24] <NoxTurminal> The turk that thing puts out has to be outrageous 
[20:55:27] <vinrock> part of my russian trip is going to hear one of those things fire up in person
[20:55:56] <teh_f4ll3n> pretty loud, but not as loud as you'd expect
[20:56:09] <vinrock> i wanna hear how deep it sounds
[20:56:18] <vinrock> im surrounded by bigass 600hp+ diesel trucks here
[20:56:32] <vinrock> the biggest ones we have are 18 liter
[20:56:47] <teh_f4ll3n> stand next to a diesel train when it fires up
[20:56:53] <teh_f4ll3n> same thing pretty much
[20:56:53] <vinrock> thats also on my list
[20:56:59] <mrghostman> the M1070 is also a cool truck
[20:57:06] <NoxTurminal> 2200 nm of torque
[20:57:32] <vinrock> yeah those are dope
[20:57:46] <NoxTurminal> Approximately 1700 ft lbs of torque the maz 537 put out
[20:57:51] <vinrock> a few of the heavy lift companies around here bought the early modes with the 500hp detroits that were auctioned off when the new 700hp models came out
[20:57:57] <NoxTurminal> That's just retarded
[20:58:00] <vinrock> but theyre slow af
[20:58:09] <vinrock> i think like 40mph top speed in the 500hp model
[20:58:27] <NoxTurminal> They probably used gear reduction to meaning the engine torque is multiplied
[20:58:35] <vinrock> Yeah
[20:58:43] <vinrock> plus all axles are drive axles

[20:59:40] <vinrock> 18 speed with 4 speed aux trans, and then 2sp splits on the rears
[20:59:46] <DrGibby> I mean, my truck has 10 gears
[20:59:52] <DrGibby> and thats a standard 1-ton

[21:00:34] <vinrock> nice
[21:00:37] <vinrock> what car
[21:00:43] <NoxTurminal> Sitting eye level with semi trucks is fun
[21:00:43] <teh_f4ll3n> I knew it! MAZ 537 IS in Spintires
[21:00:59] <DrGibby> vinrock: I almost never feel mine shift at all
[21:01:21] <vinrock> im always in sport mode so i feel it 
[21:01:21] <DrGibby> in fact, it keeps it in the proper power band like 90% of the time, usually between 1500-3000RPM
[21:01:47] <NoxTurminal> 10 speed ford ?
[21:01:47] <vinrock> NoxTurminal, what kinda truck
[21:01:48] <DrGibby> only when I get into it do I feel it shift a little
[21:01:58] <DrGibby> NoxTurminal: yeah, its a 2021 F150
[21:02:04] <NoxTurminal> I have a Ecoboost f150
[21:02:14] <NoxTurminal> Has the Ecoboost raptor intake on it tho
[21:02:18] <vinrock> oh my buy here just got a new roush f150 about a month ago
[21:02:20] <vinrock> nice
[21:02:20] <DrGibby> I got the v8 in mine
[21:02:26] <NoxTurminal> Manifold not the intake 
[21:02:33] <DrGibby> and then turned off the auto start/stop because fuck the planet 
[21:02:37] <NoxTurminal> So it has 12 injectors

[21:03:05] <vinrock> nice
[21:03:34] <NoxTurminal> Uses split second additional injector controller for the intake manifold gets a amazing 8mpg
[21:03:53] <vinrock> well
[21:03:55] <NoxTurminal> Nothing eco about it 🤣😂
[21:04:00] <vinrock> what ya expect with 37s

[21:04:15] <NoxTurminal> And 411 gear lmao 
[21:04:30] <vinrock> im kinda shocked they fit with only a 6" lift on a quarter ton chassis

[21:08:53] <a1> dumbass
[21:09:30] <NoxTurminal> But I'd say 90 percent of the time mines a pavement princess

[23:06:29] <Hunterkll> also... it creates a service account in AD ....
[23:07:26] <Hunterkll> under the default users OU for AD Connect you should have a user named MSOL_somerandomnumbersletters
[23:08:04] <Hunterkll> AD connect does some stuff on the O365 side, but you have nothing to care about there
[23:08:17] <Hunterkll> you just run the setup wizard with an account that has enough permissions to do what needs to be done and you're set.....

[23:08:56] <DrZak> and hope your network people didnt fuck up, like everything else in their life
[23:09:16] <Hunterkll> literally have no reason to even think about granting any O365 only account any permissions in AD however you'd get around doing that....
