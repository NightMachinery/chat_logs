[00:31:03] <electronEnergy> mastering computer science (meaning computer knowledge) is very nice. A knowledgeable professional can sell his knowledge as a service (software development for others). However, a true beauty is when that person becomes good at investment science (investment knowledge). It's possible to grow $100 into $1000, and further $1000 into $2000, and so on. The decisions need to be data-driven and every decision needs to have it
[00:31:03] <electronEnergy> risk managed (for example it's possible to set a stop loss, so when you lose for example $20 on the investment the stock will be automatically sold and you've made only a $20 loss. It's also possible to setup the opposite, i.e. if a stock reaches for example $100 profit to automatically sell it.)
[00:31:57] <electronEnergy> computer knowledge is nice, and investment knowledge is life saving. It's all about learning a few skills to let money make money while you sleep.

[01:02:38] <electronEnergy> let's say it's an inaccurate analogy
[01:02:58] <^-^hi> one dumbass wasting money on a social media and then kicking all the member (wth) is not representative of how stuff work.
[01:03:00] <pulse> electronEnergy, Knowledge beats money. Suppose there's a zombie apocalypse and you have bags of money. What's worth more, being able to grow your food or having bags of money?
[01:03:00] <yin> i feel it translates my point very concisely
[01:03:00] <electronEnergy> that means we can't use it as an example because it's not an instance of those two concepts. It's an instance of some other concepts.
[01:03:22] <^-^hi> pulse: we aren't on a zombie apocalypse
[01:03:31] <pulse> Supposed you're trapped in a cave with 10 billion dollars. What's worth more, being able to get out of that cave or having money?
[01:03:42] <yin> ^-^hi: noone was kicked, people left because they had the knowledge to do so
[01:03:54] <pulse> Suppose you're in a helicopter and the pilot jumps out randomly. What's worth more, having 10 billion on your account or having the knowledge to land the craft safely? ;)
[01:03:56] <pulse> Etc.
[01:04:26] <pulse> Always look at the limit case and the answer becomes obvious.
[01:04:30] <^-^hi> yin: they forcibly took the channel and and the channel masters left, with them some people. then he wiped the whole db.
[01:04:37] <electronEnergy> pulse knowledge beats money - it depends. Objectively, money can most probably buy teams of knowledgeable people on any subject, but knowledge probably can't get most money
[01:04:40] <arahael> pulse: i feel this discussion could depend on what the money is made out of ;)
[01:04:48] <^-^hi> pulse: 8 billion people are not in a cave or helicopter
[01:04:56] <pulse> arahael, Well, it's certainly not made of being able to fly a helicopter. ;)
[01:05:02] <electronEnergy> knowledge is easy to copy, but money is hard to get when you meet somebody who has it and tells you how he got it
[01:05:09] <arahael> pulse: heh.
[01:05:12] <pulse> ^-^hi, That's quite irrelevant wrt. my analogy
[01:05:16] <^-^hi> or was it 7 billion
[01:05:23] <yin> arahael: candy
[01:05:27] <pulse> The point is that in a life-or-death situation, money becomes worthless while knowledge becomes vital.
[01:05:34] <pulse> Therefore, knowledge > money.
[01:05:37] <arahael> in any case, money tends to represent "resources".
[01:05:44] <^-^hi> pulse: the point is that imaginary situations aren't representative of how stuff works in real life.
[01:05:48] <yin> electronEnergy: money is easier to copy then knowledge
[01:06:02] <arahael> yin: hmm. candy.
[01:06:02] <pulse> There's probably some situations where money is worth more than knowledge.
[01:06:07] <electronEnergy> situations do not objectively contrast knowledge vs. money. Cherry picking of situations is biased.
[01:06:11] <pyzozord> its much harder to take away from you what you know
[01:06:11] <manicennui> pulse: Most real life and death situations are more like the insurance company denies your claim.
[01:06:14] <pyzozord> money is much easier to take
[01:06:15] <^-^hi> pulse: a civil war breaks in your country, you want to be a master in CS or have enough money to run away?
[01:06:17] <manicennui> In which case, money is useful.
[01:06:26] <pulse> ^-^hi, But that is almost exactly how it works in real life. A person who can code well can earn any amount of money. Having an amount of money without being able to code is a far worse situation.

[01:07:20] <electronEnergy> to be fully objective, all knowledge is for sale

[01:41:54] <yin> > "Not even wrong" refers to any statement, argument or explanation that can be neither correct nor incorrect, because it fails to meet the criteria by which correctness and incorrectness are determined. As a more formal fallacy, it refers to the fine art of generating an ostensibly "correct" conclusion, but from premises known to be wrong or inapplicable.

[02:28:32] <ski> (in case of being able to return a (local) function (referring to non-local (and non-global) variables), it's common to dynamically allocate its activation frame (containing bindings for parameters, and local variables) on a heap structure, rather than on a stack (or perhaps to move from stack to heap, on return). some implementations allocate *all* activation frames on such a heap. some, e.g. compiling 
[02:28:39] <ski> via C, treat the stack of the host implementation, as if it were a heap. there's also <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management>, which is intermediate inbetween stack allocation (with nested lifetimes), and heap allocation (with dynamic lifetimes, commonly with GC))

[02:36:07] <Decker> exactly - so all the things that decribe what had happened
[02:36:13] <PlanckWalk> Conventions for commit messages in my current team project are statements of what has been changed by this commit.
[02:36:19] <ski> you'd probably best read docs, or papers associated with the ML Kit. i'm sure there's also other resources (before ML Kit. they pioneered a way to *infer* where to insert region annotations into the program, alleviating that burden from the programmer)
[02:36:24] <Decker> especially if you're rebasing none of that is present
[02:36:45] <ski> "In  computer science, region-based memory management is a type of memory management in which each allocated object is assigned to a region. A region, also called a zone, arena, area, or memory context, is a collection of allocated objects that can be efficiently reallocated or deallocated all at once."
[02:37:11] <PlanckWalk> Which bug was fixed, which feature was added, what cleanup was done and sometimes why.
[02:37:24] <electronEnergy> PlanckWalk if you start with $1000, and set a stop loss on each of your deals, i.e. when you lose $25 it can automatically stop that deal and collect the remaining money, then you risk $25 in order to get whatever amount you set should be automatically collected. Some stocks (shares in ownership of a company) have a high growth potential, such as electric cars, energy, etc. So, there are economic reasons for why they 
[02:37:24] <electronEnergy> should go up. And therefore, the uncertainty is lower than randomly buying/selling stuff with feelings.
[02:37:44] <PlanckWalk> electronEnergy: You're innumerate.
[02:37:53] <ski> with stack allocation, you basically only allocate on the top of the stack. with region-based, you can have a stack of regions, and you can allocate in a non-top region (and then, when popping the stack, all allocations in a region are discarded all at once, in a single operation)
[02:38:13] <PlanckWalk> "Go up" yes.  "Reliably go up 360% per year on average" no.
[02:38:13] <electronEnergy> PlanckWalk it does add $60,000/year and more when you have accumulated enough money to invest in your portfolio.
[02:38:36] <PlanckWalk> electronEnergy: Which when you start from $1000, doesn't happen in the *3 years* you claimed.

[02:41:58] <sonny> trading is a zero sum game :-)
[02:42:11] <electronEnergy> PlanckWalk return on investment is in percents. Good, low-risk investments can be accumulated to achieve and grow good returns. And let's say working without a degree is also possible, and investing $500/month  or $1000/month will increase the returns, even if you need to collect the money after 3 weeks to pay your rent with it. As long as you set a stop loss, you're risking the amount in your stop loss, i.e. $50, not th
[02:42:11] <electronEnergy> whole $500 or $1000.
[02:43:06] <electronEnergy> when there is a shortage of oil and I own some shares of oil, I'm getting good returns
[02:44:13] <sonny> ski: thx, now it's time for implementation
[02:44:26] <electronEnergy> when the demand for electric cars is growing, and you own some shares of a company that produces them, their value will grow when the company grows.

[02:45:26] <PlanckWalk> electronEnergy: You said low-risk.
[02:45:40] <PlanckWalk> You don't get from $1000 to $60k/yr by investing with low-risk.

[04:10:34] <electronEnergy> yin but you have to give a quote in advance and then make it on that budget. So, that is you take all the risk and the buyer has none, except for you not delivering it and causing him issues by not being ready with it on time.
[04:11:04] <yin> electronEnergy: are you asking me what is my successful approach to that (ubiquotous) problematic?
[04:11:40] <sonny> haskell tutorial has a monad section
[04:12:09] <electronEnergy> yin how is it a low risk investment when you have uncertainties about the actual hours of your time that it will take to develop something. My successful approach is to bill for the actual hours spent and to inform about actual complications when they arise.
[04:12:44] <yin> electronEnergy: who said anything about low risk investments?
[04:12:52] <ski> "You Could Have Invented Monads! (And Maybe You Already Have)" by dpiponi at 2006-08-07 at <http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html> is one reasonable monad tutorial, imho
[04:12:56] <yin> electronEnergy: i think that your approach is sane.
[04:13:20] <electronEnergy> well, offering software development services to others who mandate a fixed budget work is an investment of time for a fixed budget in return.

[04:14:34] <ski> both of those assumes some familiarity with Haskell syntax, though
[04:15:08] <electronEnergy> yin my point is there isn't really empirical knowledge in software development that could be used for estimates unless asked to do exactly the same thing (same language, same frameworks, same versions of libraries)
[04:15:19] <CoJaBo> arahael: Every developer has their time-travel-request story. I have.. more than one
[04:15:47] <electronEnergy> yin instead of empirical knowledge, there are only analysis and approximation

[04:24:59] <ski> [itchyjunk] : what "execute/run" means is monad-specific. what you do is you start with small parsers, like one that eats a single token and delivers it back to its invoker, one that always fails to parse anything, &c. .. and you build up larger parser actions from these, by combining them in sequence. one of the two operations in the monadic interface does exactly that, combine two actions into a 
[04:25:05] <ski> larger action such that, when the latter is executed, it executes the two former, in sequence (implicitly passing the tokens that the first didn't consume to the second, also short-circuiting (and, in general, backtracking), if some intermediate sub-parser fails)
[04:25:14] <electronEnergy> yin based on the same report, #1 for success is user involvement. #2 or #3 is clear and complete requirements specification. So, it appears most failures happen when requirements are captured in the beginning, perhaps not 100% complete, perhaps not 100% clear, and the project starts anyway, it does not involve the user, or it involves the user and he is allowed to change the requirements

They are complications that will require more time to solve. Small complications can be overcome, but big ones will need a lot of rework, etc. And we have huge uncertainties, so in other words a huge number of risks that might occur during the development. We can't guarantee any 
[04:29:01] <electronEnergy> deadline for sure except when we've developed the exact same thing before, in the same language, framework, with the same versions of libraries. Otherwise, there is a risk it will take a different time, and that some issues won't be solved before the deadline.

[05:06:34] <yin> electronEnergy: professional software is made in many ways
[05:06:50] <InPhase> CoJaBo: The only condition under which it operated correctly in the target environment as-is was surrounded by dry ice.  Which was enough to do some work, but on the whole, a failure.
[05:06:56] <electronEnergy> by teams
[05:07:02] <CoJaBo> Nice
[05:07:05] <yin> electronEnergy: and not by teams
[05:07:09] <electronEnergy> by teams
[05:07:20] <yin> ok
[05:07:30] <InPhase> CoJaBo: And it took me about 6 months of work to discover the dry ice solution.  It was not, in fact, overheating.  Just way too sensitive.

[05:07:57] <yin> have you ever developed software, electronEnergy ?
[05:08:00] <CoJaBo> InPhase: what kind of thing was it

[05:11:01] <yin> electronEnergy: my point is that you're not even wrong
[05:11:25] <kodah> electronEnergy: i work at a large firm. most of our development is not done in "teams" as you would think.
[05:11:26] <CoJaBo> InPhase: Could've just chucked in an AC compressor, gluing the condenser directly to the chip :P

[08:17:38] <OverCoder> why is HDMI said to not support displaying content on two different monitors through the same one port
[08:18:11] <Decker> *shrug* works fine for me with this 8:1 mux
[08:18:20] <OverCoder> why stops me from triggering the GPU to display 3840x1080 canvas (two 1080p monitors side by side), and then telling the OS to display on two monitors

[12:01:37] <Intelo> Hi
[12:01:44] <Intelo> While doing integration test for api testing. What is a good way to test? a) make api call inside test code and also directly check (fetch/select) entries in database those were supposed to be created by that api cal. b) in response of real api call, always return json of objects created in database (e.g user created, even if its a GET call and 200
[12:01:45] <Intelo> response might have been ok, just to test what was created, I should return what was inserted / updated in database for each api call c) try to check one api with another api (this might not always be possible). e.g test create user api with user profile api. If user was created successfully, then profile api should return correct data. c) any
[12:01:45] <Intelo> other?

[14:08:00] <ne2k> looking for a good recipe for dealing with processing Buffer data in nodejs without introducing memory leaks. I have a serial over TCP connection and it gives me a chunk as a buffer which I concatenate with buffer = Buffer.concat([buffer, newdata]); and then I go through the buffer and pull out messages between STX and ETX. quesiton is what to do with the buffer once I've dealt with a chunk. Buffer.slice is what I'm currently looking at, but I wonder if 
[14:08:00] <ne2k> that is a good idea

[17:17:13] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, yes but i also need to implement Runnable

[17:17:22] <sonny> while not game over; do stuff;
[17:17:24] <bomb> it's a loop that usually runs 60 times per second

[17:18:22] <bomb> Java 2D is an immediate mode API. you're supposed to draw whatever you want to draw on each frame
[17:18:25] <[itchyjunk]> so i do want runnable
[17:18:25] <sonny> you can do it in the same class

[17:32:37] <Quietwalker> the problem here is that when they're remote workers, and they go to log in with their company id & such, they can't, because it's not connected to it, and they don't yet have a locally cached profile, so it can't validate the userid/password.

But you don't have the user with an ID of 1 in your local DB table yet, but you still want to insert the row for the blog post with a proper reference to the users row. So you'd create a user without any details, and use that ID as the reference to the blog post in your table

[19:33:17] <amcsi> also it may be that you won't get to run endpoint "A" again. And because say you're not actually calling endpoints, but rather the 3rd party API is notifying _you_ about new rows for table "A"

[22:53:04] <pyzozord> pulse: the programming language equivalent of that "composing" I think it would be just stealing good ideas from other languages :D
[22:53:22] <davros> so lets say this posix-like filesystem is emulated in an environment with long latencies..
[22:53:22] <pulse> pyzozord, no, because ideas != implementations.
[22:53:34] <pulse> If you could take chunks of implementations and stitch them together Frankenstein-style, then sure.
[22:53:54] <pulse> But just clumping ideas together still leaves you with a massive task of implementing them in a way that makes it practical and competitive.
[22:53:57] <pyzozord> nah, programs are formalized ideas
[22:53:58] <davros> "1. i'm probably going to use these files, eg assets/*;  2. start making actual fopen() ,fread() calls"
[22:53:58] <pulse> Which is borderline impossible for a solo dev.
[22:54:07] <pyzozord> implementation is a detail
[22:54:22] <GeDaMo> davros: maybe mmap with MAP_POPULATE "Populate (prefault) page tables for a mapping.  For a file mapping, this causes read-ahead on the file."
[22:54:23] <pulse> No, implementation is the difference between the idea of a car, and an actual car. :p

[22:55:14] <davros> sounding similar, however mmap sounds like it does more than i had in mind.. i.e. actually bringing the thing in for real, allocating space in virtual memory

[23:05:12] <macaw> I'd say Lisp (Common Lisp, fennel) strikes that balance for me well. It's a full language - fast, general and the ability to write code that writes code (= your own syntax).

[23:12:29] <pulse> macaw, What kind of code though? I mean, how complex was it?
[23:12:37] <macaw> pulse: I'm guessing this is what pyzozord (and Linus) meant by programming in binary.
[23:12:44] <pyzozord> binary is nothing more than assembly but with 1s and 0s. Intel manuals have binary value for each opcode

[23:12:53] <user51> i still dont have parentehsis there, though
[23:13:12] <pulse> The problem is with binary you'd get blurry vision from all the 1s and 0s. With ASM you at least have some identifiers you can immediately see.
[23:13:13] <user51> my only idea is to make parenthesis set a precedence of 0, so that subsequent expressions could execute

[23:38:13] <baudejogos_net> and this is definitely not the trend I see
[23:38:20] * baudejogos_net is also an interviewer
[23:38:33] <baudejogos_net> and most candidates are depressive or lazy
[23:38:46] <pyzozord> e\: can I ask what motivated you to commit to something like that?
[23:39:14] <baudejogos_net> :)

[23:40:27] <pyzozord> I honestly highly regret my first reaction
[23:41:03] <pyzozord> I get irritated when someone reacts like this when I say I work in javascript
[23:41:25] <pyzozord> we should work to get that kind of attitudes out of our field
[23:41:47] <baudejogos_net> I have no idea of what you are talking about
[23:42:08] <baudejogos_net> but I pity who has to solely work on js. it's painful

[23:45:01] <e\> pyzozord: Sure.  I was an office worker in a company's sales operations department. This company was a Salesforce customer. Companies use Salesforce as a CRM and to conduct business/operations. Highly customizable. I was an end user in my daily work. I learned about making Salesforce a career, like becoming a companiy's Salesforce admin. I learned that first, earned a cert, and eventually got
[23:45:02] <e\> my first role as an admin. From there I learned to develop on the platform and made moves in that direction. I was motivated by desire for a universal, desirable skill and - of course - PAY.

[23:47:28] <RedNifre> What's a good platform for a chatbot other than IRC? I tried to write a twitter bot once, but it was very annoying to get started. Maybe Signal, Telegram, something else?
[23:47:47] *** Quits: sonny (~sonny@bras-base-london1483w-grc-30-74-12-157-200.dsl.bell.ca) (Client Quit)
[23:47:53] <pyzozord> e\: you are in perfect position to keep learning and generalizing your skills, you can now learn pretty much any programming language or computer concept you want
[23:47:56] <RedNifre> I would be the only user of the bot and it would be nice if it ran on a raspberry pi at my home or something.
[23:47:56] <dodo> RedNifre: what are you looking for, what's wrong with irc?
[23:48:28] <RedNifre> dodo I don't have a good irc client on my phone, I'd prefer the bot to be reachable by an app that I already have with me already.

[23:51:20] <pyzozord> e\: there is a 300 page book that's really a great foundation for anything and everything related to programming. It opens many doors, including understanding deeper how computer memory works, fundamental algorithms and data structures, even creating your own programming language

[23:51:46] <flakland> instead of writing your own client you could write your own client?
[23:51:57] <pyzozord> e\: it's called K&R and it teaches you the C programming language. It's the language in which Linux is written and many of the software used everywhere https://archive.org/details/the_c_programming_language_2_20181213/mode/2up

[23:54:31] <e\> pyzozord: True. Salesofrce has there own programming language that only works on their platform called Apex. It's like there backend code, built on and similar to Java. They also have a frontend library, Lightning Web Components, using web component standards and JS. I am interested in ventering out further and going deeper. I'll checkout out that book.
