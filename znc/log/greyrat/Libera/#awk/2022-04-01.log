[00:44:46] <xmb> any way to auto remove like rightly field assign, leading spaces, after $1 = ""
[00:44:54] <xmb> find -type f -printf %T@\ %p\\n | sort -n | awk '$1 = ""; 1'
[00:46:38] <emanuele6> you can't use \n as separator for filenames
[00:47:25] <emanuele6> and you really don't want to use default FS either
[00:47:45] <emanuele6> because it will mess up the result if the file name starts with a space
[00:47:47] <emanuele6> or tab
[00:50:57] <xmb> it begins with ./
[00:51:11] <xmb> $1 is time of file
[00:51:16] <xmb> and i fast dirty \n
[00:51:37] <xmb> but good update, sec
[00:53:34] <emanuele6> it would still mess it up if it ends in space or tab...
[00:53:40] <emanuele6> # printf '1\t2\t\n' | awk '{ $1="" } 1' | od -An -c
[00:53:41] <shbot> emanuele6:        2  \n
[00:53:55] <emanuele6> assignments to a field, recompute the whole record
[00:54:15] <emanuele6> which will delete trailing spaces and tabs with the default FS
[00:55:46] <xmb> how to recompute the whole record, $1 = $1 or what
[00:56:08] <emanuele6> any assignment to a field recomputes
[00:56:42] <emanuele6> # printf '1\ta filename that ends in tab\t\n' | awk '1' | od -An -c 
[00:56:43] <shbot> emanuele6:    1  \t   a       f   i   l   e   n   a   m   e       t   h   a
[00:56:43] <shbot> emanuele6:    t       e   n   d   s       i   n       t   a   b  \t  \n
[00:56:52] <emanuele6> # printf '1\ta filename that ends in tab\t\n' | awk '{ $1 = "" } 1' | od -An -c 
[00:56:53] <shbot> emanuele6:        a       f   i   l   e   n   a   m   e       t   h   a   t
[00:56:53] <shbot> emanuele6:        e   n   d   s       i   n       t   a   b  \n
[00:57:05] <xmb> no i have this, number space ./files
[00:57:09] <emanuele6> do you not see that the \t at the end got removed?
[00:57:18] <xmb> i want to cut off number aka $1 but didnt wanna use sub or so
[00:57:23] <emanuele6> ` t   a   b  \t  \n' -> ` t   a   b  \n'
[00:57:28] <xmb> hm
[00:57:29] <xmb> i see
[00:57:33] <xmb> as u mentioned now
[00:57:36] <xmb> its too much garbage data
[00:57:40] <xmb> to see anything
[00:57:43] <xmb> but trailing yea
[00:57:51] <xmb> so i change fs hold on for updates i didnt update sec
[00:59:12] <xmb> this one seems to do
[00:59:16] <xmb> # find -type f -printf '%T@\1%p\0' | sort -zn | gawk -v RS=\\0 -F \\1 '{ print $2 }'
[00:59:17] <shbot> xmb: ./.mkshrc
[00:59:17] <shbot> xmb: ./.bashrc
[00:59:32] <xmb> \1 is garbaged from files
[00:59:35] *** Parts: larryv (~larryv@zsh/patchmanager/larryv) ()
[00:59:39] <xmb> cause sort -z cant take multi length
[01:00:28] <xmb> i like -v RS=\\0\\0 -v FS=\\0
[01:00:40] <xmb> but thats sort incompatible i'd have to make it multiple cmd passes
[01:02:06] <emanuele6> just use GNU cut
[01:02:18] <emanuele6> cut -z -d' ' -f2-
[01:02:43] <xmb> ?
[01:02:57] <emanuele6> find . -type f -printf '%T@ %p\0' | sort -z -n | cut -z -d' ' -f2-
[01:03:13] <emanuele6> or even
[01:03:22] <emanuele6> find . -type f -printf '%T@\t%p\0' | sort -z -n | cut -z -f2-
[01:05:13] <xmb> very nice i think
[01:05:24] <xmb> thank you much
[01:08:32] <xmb> emanuele6, http://0x0.st/oqET.txt
[01:09:02] <emanuele6> you don't need -type f anymore?
[01:09:04] <xmb> i tr \\0 \\n for terminal usage
[01:09:06] <xmb> no i test
[01:09:11] <emanuele6> also what is "$@" supposed to do?
[01:09:15] <xmb> its 'recents' or 'recents find opts'
[01:09:17] <emanuele6> is that injecting starting points?
[01:09:22] <xmb> yea
[01:09:23] <xmb> so the plan
[01:09:28] <emanuele6> you can't just pass them like that
[01:09:36] <xmb> since ever i did
[01:09:41] <xmb> but, tell
[01:10:07] <emanuele6> '!' ',' '(' ')' and anything that starts with '-' will have a special meaning
[01:10:21] <xmb> thats good
[01:10:25] <xmb> i can use "$@" be -opts
[01:10:25] <emanuele6> in bash 5.2, you will be able to avoid this problem with:
[01:10:39] <xmb> i want entry points + optional find opts
[01:10:45] <xmb> optional entry pointns + optional find opts
[01:10:46] <xmb> all k
[01:10:48] <xmb> =))
[01:10:50] <emanuele6>  "${@/#[!-]/.\/&}"
[01:11:02] <xmb> uh
[01:11:08] <emanuele6> but for now you must loop and fix it
[01:11:15] <emanuele6> oops, not that
[01:11:16] <xmb> i can fix manually
[01:11:20] <xmb> yep
[01:11:30] <emanuele6>  "${@/#[!/]/.\/&}" 
[01:11:39] <emanuele6> that is what i meant
[01:11:45] <emanuele6> but it will only work in bash5.2
[01:11:48] <xmb> # set -- --a --b --c ; printf %s--\ \  "${@/#/./}"
[01:11:48] <shbot> xmb: ./--a--  ./--b--  ./--c--
[01:11:59] <xmb> yours is very inefficient
[01:11:59] <emanuele6> you can't just do that
[01:12:08] <xmb> i can why not
[01:12:13] <emanuele6> # set -- /etc/systemd --a --b --c ; printf %s--\ \  "${@/#/./}" 
[01:12:13] <xmb> since ever done so, but .... tell
[01:12:14] <shbot> emanuele6: .//etc/systemd--  ./--a--  ./--b--  ./--c--
[01:12:25] <xmb> well ok
[01:12:28] <emanuele6> .//etc/systemd and /etc/systemd are not the same directory
[01:12:36] <xmb> sec
[01:12:44] <xmb> # set -- --a --b --c ; printf %s--\ \  "${@/#-/./-}"
[01:12:45] <shbot> xmb: ./--a--  ./--b--  ./--c--
[01:12:46] <emanuele6> it's not "very inefficient", it's just correct.
[01:12:56] <xmb> a & is not needed really
[01:12:57] <emanuele6> # set -- '(' --a --b --c ; printf %s--\ \  "${@/#-/./-}"
[01:12:57] <shbot> emanuele6: (--  ./--a--  ./--b--  ./--c--
[01:13:04] <xmb> hmm
[01:13:10] <emanuele6> xmb: ...
[01:13:23] <xmb> so ( and unescaped
[01:13:29] <xmb> even if quoted a ( is fine
[01:13:29] <emanuele6> why do you always think i don't know the problem if i know the problem?
[01:13:31] <xmb> whats the problem
[01:13:41] <xmb> we're on the fixing
[01:13:53] <emanuele6> i brought up the problem, i probably know what the problem is..
[01:14:01] <xmb> so u cant comm
[01:14:03] <xmb> like the others
[01:14:10] <xmb> whats the issue with ' ( '
[01:14:19] <emanuele6> what are you talking about now?
[01:14:25] <xmb> # mkdir \( ; x=\( ; find "$x"
[01:14:26] <shbot> xmb: find: invalid expression; expected to find a ')' but didn't see one.  Perhaps you need an extra predicate after '('
[01:14:33] <emanuele6> right..
[01:14:36] <xmb> i see
[01:14:56] <xmb> [!-] is not... till -
[01:15:21] <xmb> another dirty fix:
[01:15:27] <emanuele6> "${@/#[!-]/.\/&}" doesn't solve the problem as i said
[01:15:34] <xmb> ah
[01:15:36] <xmb> i fix it:
[01:15:36] <emanuele6> i meant to type  "${@/#[!/]/.\/&}"
[01:16:13] <xmb> yea
[01:16:14] <xmb> that works
[01:16:19] <xmb> just wanted to type it and read
[01:16:28] <xmb> so u know the problem now
[01:16:33] <xmb> not !- !/ 
[01:16:35] <xmb> :)
[01:16:42] <emanuele6> i knew the problem already...
[01:16:46] <xmb> cool workaround
[01:16:49] <xmb> yea but u mistyped
[01:16:55] <xmb> and till before i couldnt see
[01:16:58] <xmb> till u typed !/
[01:17:03] <xmb> its a bit long, see
[01:17:30] <emanuele6> 22:41:15 <emanuele6 > oops, not that
[01:17:40] <xmb> and didnt fix
[01:17:44] <emanuele6> 22:41:30 <emanuele6 >  "${@/#[!/]/.\/&}"
[01:17:49] <xmb> hm
[01:17:51] <xmb> sorry
[01:17:54] <xmb> lemme scroll
[01:18:23] <xmb> i see, i didnt see
[01:18:28] <xmb> well the non 5.2 version:
[01:18:56] <emanuele6> 22:41:08 <emanuele6 > but for now you must loop and fix it
[01:19:05] <xmb> hrmpf it requires multiple passes for --opts and ./ or / separtation
[01:19:06] <xmb> yes
[01:19:13] <xmb> so anyway
[01:19:27] <xmb> its to find recent files, if a dir is ( i know well to type ./(
[01:19:41] <xmb> fixing this is scripts in predicture of users usage is .. not my thing
[01:20:06] <emanuele6> if you don't care about the problem, i don't care
[01:20:17] <emanuele6> i just did the responsible thing and told you about it
[01:20:29] <emanuele6> you don't have to make up excuses for your laziness
[01:21:14] <xmb> i wont, i also keep this technique in mind, but i dont need it here
[01:21:21] <xmb> the point is not to fix wrong usage of ( as arg
[01:21:31] <xmb> my stuff, .. i code valid for valid usage
[01:21:41] <xmb> when find ( is not valid, nor find \(, dont type it
[01:22:21] <emanuele6> # mkdir '\('; >> '\(/a'; find '\('
[01:22:22] <shbot> emanuele6: \(
[01:22:22] <shbot> emanuele6: \(/a
[01:22:43] <emanuele6> '\(' is not problematic, why would it be?
[01:22:51] <xmb> u '\(' i didnt
[01:23:02] <emanuele6> find ( doesn't even make sense
[01:23:05] <xmb> right
[01:23:09] <xmb> u made that bug example
[01:23:16] <emanuele6> what?
[01:23:19] <xmb> sec
[01:23:26] <xmb> this script i just do recents, not even args
[01:23:29] <xmb> its for listing files
[01:23:32] <xmb> anything wrong with it yet ?
[01:24:03] <emanuele6> whatever you are about to send is probably going to be something unrelated..
[01:24:10] <xmb> hu
[01:24:14] <xmb> i sent it already, but sec
[01:24:21] <xmb> http://0x0.st/oqET.txt
[01:24:52] <xmb> i kind of never used cut before
[01:24:55] <xmb> long ago i did, not properly
[01:26:01] <xmb> so no bug anymore all ok, =p
[01:26:36] <emanuele6> it's not true, but you don't care and you are just going to bother me because i told you about it

[01:28:06] <xmb> i care much about code vlaidity and security and properness
[01:28:14] <emanuele6> 22:39:16 <emanuele6 > is that injecting starting points?
[01:28:24] <emanuele6> 22:39:22 <xmb > yea
[01:28:30] <emanuele6> 22:39:28 <emanuele6 > you can't just pass them like that
[01:28:31] <xmb> yes i didnt understand
[01:28:33] <xmb> what is the problem
[01:28:38] <xmb> its valid usage
[01:28:41] <xmb> of user

[01:29:24] <xmb> if u think
[01:29:33] <xmb> one might insert bad commands, u might as well stop writing code
[01:29:46] <xmb> i write code for fitful usage, i dont see a bug here, tell me otherwise
[01:29:54] <xmb> u as most tell me wrong usage by user
