[07:24:44] <companion_cube> wires are still much more reliable…
[07:28:15] <badtuple> No one makes wired headphones that are still noise canceling though :(
[07:29:01] <badtuple> Seriously. I got some Bose to replace an older pair I had. They didn't have noise canceling wired ones, but the bluetooth ones had a wire backup!  Turns out once I got them, it doesn't noise cancel when the wire is being used.

[14:12:04] <mockturtle> [ Minimal Loss Hashing for Compact Binary Codes ] - norouzi.github.io
[14:12:47] <river> but just for the binary codes, how do we query for other nearby  codes?
[14:13:33] <river> maybe chop the code into small parts and and then just bucket these based on bitcount
[14:13:52] *** Joins: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud)
[14:14:21] <amirouche> apparantly, since d(mlh(b0), mlh(b1)) is much faster than d(b0, b1) so you can compute and sort all the thing.
[14:14:25] <river> then if the codes are approximately uniform, you at least have an upper bound on hamming distance and a set of smaller computations to do now
[14:14:58] <amirouche> re bucketing bitcount, good I idea I guess, that is more or less what I do.
[14:15:48] <amirouche> bitcount of 1010 is the same as 0101 but they are much different.

[17:28:09] <epilys> river, sounds cool, what does "integration" entail in this case? is your blog an activitypub actor/user?

[17:28:31] <river> but hopefully it means people can comment
[17:28:45] <epilys> WilhelmVonWeiner, they use scheduling/event processing daemons

[17:30:13] <WilhelmVonWeiner> epilys: exactly what i was looking for, thanks!
[17:30:28] <epilys> no prob glad I could help
[17:32:43] <epilys> river, there's this indieweb/w3c protocol called webmention that can be used for comments https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/
