[06:05:40] <epony> solve it with the vendor, until then Intel wireless is a bad choice
[06:06:11] <epony> (don't care since I don't buy intel laptops for my free sytems)

[06:09:53] <epony> as absurd as claiming that "replacing Windows with Linux and removing a couple of drivers and installing a couple of firmwares that don't work solve your problems" while the rest of the problems in the hardware still exist and can not be addressed by software

[06:11:36] <DiffieHellman> If you need to load up proprietary firmware for the hardware to function, well then that hardware won't operate without proprietary software, which makes it nonfree. 
[06:11:37] <epony> hardware and firmware problems can not be solved with software and a couple of logo removals
[06:12:18] <epony> so, the conclusion: IBM and Lenovo laptops are NOT SUITABLE for a free and reliable / trustworthy system
[06:12:28] <DiffieHellman> If libre intlel wireless firmware is written, then the problem is solved, as you'll then be able to upload free software to the wireless card in order to use it.

[06:13:19] <DiffieHellman> You seem to be matching up computers that don't function without proprietary software and a free software firmware replacement for a wireless card, that would allow using it in freedo.
[06:13:23] <epony> because none of the people involved in that understand the hardware, the firmware and the implants in full, they claim that some "PARTIAL" or rather "MINIMAL" change is fixing it
[06:13:34] <epony> so FSF lies.

[06:14:37] <DiffieHellman> The FSF doesn't lie, they only claim that the computers don't require any external proprietary software to operate.
[06:14:51] <DiffieHellman> They don't claim that the hardware isn't proprietaryn
[06:15:03] <epony> by LYING the FSF is covering up the real problems of the defective hardware and firmware in full, it just chooses to advertise its ENDORSED resellers for a percentage cut or free publicity

[06:16:42] <epony> FSF calls other free software systems like OpenBSD and FreeBSD, it calls these systems NON FREE, and then turns around and starts LYING that proprietary malware implanted hardware and firmware bundles from CORPORATIONS are now FREE under its ENDORESEMENT for a markup on the resale
[06:17:14] <DiffieHellman> OpenBSD and FreeBSD ships nonfree software, so it doesn't ensorse them

[06:18:34] <epony> DiffieHellman, OpenBSD gives free software as a gift since the project beginning in 1993, and FreeBSD and NetBSD provide the same freedoms software too

[06:22:44] <DiffieHellman> Well, all the hardware in those laptops is functional when you boot it up and you don't need to load proprietary firmware onto it.
[06:23:32] <DiffieHellman> The thinkpad's BIOS is also free software, thanks to libreboot. Sure there's software running on the EC, but you don't typically change that, so it's part of the hardware.
[06:23:36] <epony> FSF LIES about deblobbing and firmware replacements too, because it covers up the incomplete and the incorrect solution to the manifacturer built-in DEFECTS in that PROPRIETARY and HIGHLY IMPLANTED and MALWARE CRIPPLED hardware and firmware bundle

[07:26:14] <isf> hello
[07:28:01] <[itchyjunk]> So i've come across many debates about if hardwares can be open source or not. And the general contention is that hardware needs binary blobs and such so it can never be open source and what not.
[07:28:10] <[itchyjunk]> What is your view on this?
[07:28:47] <[itchyjunk]> Like there is RISC-V but the claim is that companies implementing it will extend the instruction set and add blobs etc so even RISC-V isn't a solution to open source hardware

[07:32:36] <jxself> RISC-V is probably not a solution, no. It probably never was. RISC-V is just an ISA. An entire computer is more than just the instruction set.
[07:32:51] *** Parts: mcornick (fca145cfd2@user/mcornick) (WeeChat 3.4)

[07:34:29] <jxself> That doesn't mean it's not useful to have a freely-licensed ISA. Just that it is only one part of a computer, and doesn't give you a complete computer in and of itself.
[07:35:29] <[itchyjunk]> Why can there be free software versions of all the things needed for the rest of the computer?

[07:37:58] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm

[07:41:53] <jxself> That, too, is a matter of protracted discussion.

To distribute a nonfree program, to recommend a nonfree program to other people, or more generally steer them into a course that leads to using nonfree software, means leading them to give up their freedom. To be sure, leading people to use nonfree software is not the same as installing nonfree software in their computers, but we should not lead people in the wrong direction.
[07:44:56] <jxself> Any program can be free software or proprietary. Because free software isn't a technical issue.
[07:46:30] <jxself> So could the softwar used by the memory controller be free? Sure, just like any program could be.
[07:47:42] <jxself> The same with the USB controller or any other location where software could live.

[07:48:40] <DiffieHellman> There isn't a hardware copier, computers need to be manufaturered - therefore until star trek replicaters exist, "free hardware" won't be possible.
[07:48:51] <jxself> I agree with that. :)
[07:48:57] <jxself> That is my criteria as well.
[07:49:21] <isf> : )
[07:49:32] <isf> i go to bed
[07:49:36] <isf> good night
[07:49:40] <DiffieHellman> Free hardware designs are very possible mind you, but the problem is that actually manufacturing the design is nontrivial and currently very proprietary (but not in a software sense).
[07:49:52] <jxself> Once the technology exists that someone could download the design information and then "3D print then I'd agree that the era of free hardware has arrived.
[07:50:10] <jxself> I meant to have "3d print" in quotes because it probably will not be that exact technology.
[07:50:29] <DiffieHellman> Well, even then, it'll cost something in raw materals rather than >1W in electricity.
[07:50:35] <DiffieHellman> *<1W
[07:50:54] <jxself> Yes, not gratis for sure.

[07:51:32] <jxself> But hopefully better than needing your own CPU fabrication plant.
[07:52:14] <[itchyjunk]> hmm makes sense. so the ability to copy wrt hardware would be to copy actual hardware, not just design of it
[07:52:19] <DiffieHellman> Making a CPU fab can go from very expensive and annoyying to billions of dollars depending on the node size that you want.
[07:52:44] <jxself> [itchyjunk]: Well, to go from design to physical implementation.
[07:52:48] <[itchyjunk]> i thought like design of arduino being copy-able meant it satisfied that criteria
[07:53:21] <DiffieHellman> The arduino might qualify as a free hardware design for the board itself, I'm not sure about the typical AVR processors mind youp.
[07:53:42] <jxself> You have "the criteria today" and "the ideal criteria we'd like to have"
[07:54:33] <jxself> But the technology for the latter doesn't exist now.
[07:54:35] <DiffieHellman> If you buy 2nd hand hardware, expensive exotic gases, pre-prepeared silicon slabs and suitable chambers, you can make a fab in your garage, note that you'll only really be able to do single or double layer chips, so intel 8088 tier.
[07:55:21] <jxself> https://www.popsci.com/man-builds-huge-megaprocessor/
[07:55:26] <DiffieHellman> This is possible since someone released the unencumberered designs of gates for microprocessors.
[07:55:33] <jxself> I call this "human-sized computing"
[07:56:01] <White_Flame> I still need to build my lego computer.  I made gates up to a working full-adder
[07:56:09] <jxself> If you're willing to go with large and slow you can have free hardware today.
[07:56:39] <DiffieHellman> There is also the option of FGPA's if you don't mind it being slow.
[07:57:12] <White_Flame> FPGAs are WAY faster and larger than the other recently mentioned options ;)
[07:57:19] <White_Flame> s/larger/more capable/
[07:57:50] <DiffieHellman> Certain FGPA's have free software bitstream creation and programming tools and you'll be good, as try as it might, a FGPA has not much chance of backdorring your custom GNU/CPU design.
[07:57:55] <jxself> Where's my PDP-10? http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/ka10.jpg
[07:57:56] <jxself> :)
[07:59:17] <jxself> They even had free microcode, which we lost later on with Intel CPUs.
[07:59:33] <jxself> The Incompatible Timesharing System that had on the PDP-10 (that RMS hacked on while at MIT) came with its own microcode for the PDP-10.
[07:59:38] *** Quits: chuangzh1 (~chuangzhu@user/chuangzhu) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:59:56] <[itchyjunk]> So you can have FPGA's with only free software? no non free blobs at all?
[08:00:03] <DiffieHellman> Honestly, a bunch of ICE40's need to be slapped onto a circuit board, with one to handle USB, one to handle SATA, one to handle 1000BASE-T and one to run a RISC-v core.
[08:00:29] <DiffieHellman> [itchyjunk]: Thanks to icestorm and yosys, yes you can use certain ice40 FGPA's in complete freedom./
[08:00:39] <[itchyjunk]> nice
[08:01:42] *** Joins: chuangzh1 (~chuangzhu@user/chuangzhu)
[08:01:55] <jxself> The downside is that, as FPGA go, they're on the smaller side.
[08:03:07] <DiffieHellman> Still hundreds of time faster that current discrete gate designs and current free fab designs
[08:03:10] <[itchyjunk]> So here, it says the tool chain is open source. but it's more than open source, it satisfies fsf criteria?
[08:03:12] <[itchyjunk]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICE_(FPGA)#Open_source
[08:03:15] <DiffieHellman> *times
[08:04:07] <DiffieHellman> [itchyjunk]: Lots of people love to call free software "open source", even though that's a grave insult.
[08:05:17] <DiffieHellman> arachne-pnr is MIT and yosys is ISC, so they're free software.

[21:32:45] <devinu> RSeddon: perhaps you could begin by giving an overview of your paper?
[21:32:56] <devinu> (feel free to copy and paste) :)
[21:33:47] <RSeddon> Basically, it draws comparison with what's been going on regarding minority/Indigenous cultures' interests in what's done with *their* knowledge/craft/etc.
[21:34:17] <RSeddon> And it suggests that, up to a point, you can say, there are collective interests at stake here...
[21:34:32] <RSeddon> BUT you might not like the implications of going down that route.
[21:35:02] <RSeddon> It implies a rather maximalist/expansionist approach towards ownership of ideas.
[21:35:17] <iank> RSeddon, im reskimming your paper. thank you for joining :)
[21:35:35] <iank> i mean, im skimming to remember what i read
[21:35:55] <RSeddon> So there may be a legitimate collective grievance here, but there might nonetheless be a reason not to act on it.
[21:36:22] <RSeddon> Is that clear enough? Anything I should expand on?
[21:36:52] <devinu> Maybe to take a step back, we could define what Copilot is, and what it does?
[21:37:16] <devinu> (I know the definition is somewhat debatable, but perhaps we can stick to some facts of what it does)
[21:37:46] <RSeddon> Okay. Shall I, or would you rather do that bit?
[21:38:04] <devinu> Perhaps RSeddon and/or iank: 
[21:38:19] <devinu> iank: is fairly knowledgeable as well.
[21:38:32] <iank> reading still :) sorry
[21:38:34] <devinu> I read the papers, but I was unaware of copilot before I read them

[21:40:10] <RSeddon> Suppose we start by quoting the original call for papers: 'Microsoft's GitHub recently announced a new service known as Copilot. This service uses machine learning to help suggest code snippets to developers as they write software. GitHub trained this neural network with the code hosted on GitHub'
[21:41:20] <devinu> That is helpful, although the one thing that I learned from Bradley Kuhn is that we may want to avoid the word "snippet" as some of the suggestions are quite large.
[21:41:38] <craigt> RSeddon: Thanks again for making yourself available. Both the call for papers and this IRC conversation is a first of its kind, the FSF has not done anything like this before.
[21:42:27] <RSeddon> Happy to be invited.
[21:42:59] <devinu> (Robert quoted from https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-questions-around-copilot for those who are wondering.)

[21:43:54] <VitoTorleone> Are the 'snippets' (or larger chunks) considered free or proprietary?
[21:44:32] <devinu> VitoTorleone: they could end up to be under any license at the moment, under GitHub's assumption of the implication of the law
[21:44:40] <devinu> (as far as I understand)
[21:44:54] <devinu> Bradley's paper really digs deep on that topic
[21:45:27] <RSeddon> And Copilot has been known to suggest licence text too, I think. 
[21:45:37] <VitoTorleone> So, incorporating snippets could potentially render a free program non-free.
[21:45:56] <devinu> VitoTorleone: yes, as far as I understand
[21:46:13] <Gimg> I read that someone argued that the output of a neural network is in public domain
[21:46:41] <devinu> RSeddon: Please go into why you chose the terms "copyright minimalists/maximalists." I am curious and I think others would be, too.
[21:47:07] <[itchyjunk]> Hm, doesn't output generally inherit restrictions based on input? If input is proprietary, why would output be in public domain?

[21:55:01] <iank> RSeddon, I think your paper's discusssion of community interesting. After rereading your paper, I don't find the community of people who have published code as a group that makes much sense for copilot, I like the idea of the positive community

[21:56:58] <iank> RSeddon, it seems to me from the perspective of your paper, that the main unfairness in copilot is that it is SaaSS that comes from free software, and there are lots of other examples of that, https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html, what do you think about that,

[21:58:56] <iank> if the copilot model & software was all freely licensed and public, I don't think we'd be having this conversation.
[21:59:10] <RSeddon> iank: I haven't seen that essay before, so don't really have time to skim, but possibly the thing I'm emphasising here is the dragnet element.

[21:59:48] <iank> RSeddon, do you see a parallel between a search engine and copilot?
[21:59:56] <devinu> I guess one place of deep concern for me is the fact that so many developers put their code on GitHub before Microsoft bought the company (and presumably before any development of Copilot). Also, some contributor's code may be developed outside of GitHub, yet pulled onto GitHub servers, and then used for machine learning of Copilot.
[22:00:21] <iank> Lots of people feel like they published useful information on webpages, and basically only google made money (from their search engine).

[22:03:00] <RSeddon> I suppose if there's a salient difference it's that one points people towards your site - and you presumably want traffic - while the other is arguably indifferent to your purposes.
[22:03:21] <RSeddon> And at least there's robots.txt for crawlers that obey it.
[22:04:03] <devinu> iank: Google was, I believe, challenged for publishing information from books. The difference here is that Copilot's main purpose is for other developers to create something, and that something is under the new developer's own copyright. The Google case, I believe, ended with the courts saying it is fair use because the main goal was to bring people who were searching for books to the books themselves.
[22:04:15] <devinu> RSeddon: yes
[22:05:11] <RSeddon> Right, and in the case of Google Books there's also the long existence of public libraries to shape expectations.

[22:09:24] <thomzane> RSeddon: There are AI code generators put out by EleutherAI that are licensed under free licenses such as GPT-Neo, GPT-J, and GPT-NeoX that are also trained on GitHub.  How do you feel about these models?
[22:10:05] <RSeddon> devinu: Indeed. I think part of what I hoped to do with the comparison with minority cultures is clarify why people might be feeling uneasy about Copilot.
[22:10:18] <devinu> RSeddon: indeed

[22:11:10] <RSeddon> thomzane: I'm not familiar enough with them to have any clear feelings of my own, but I think it's telling that they haven't given rise to the same kind of reactions.
[22:11:33] <iank> RSeddon, copilot is part of an overall trend of exploiting free software for other software which is not free but should be. It's only been in the last 5 years or so, that it became that 99% of nonfree software starts with taking some free software and removing that freedom.
[22:11:34] <devinu> RSeddon: maybe after responding to thomzane, I am curious to know more about "Read/Write and Read/Only culture." I had not heard about it before reading your paper.
[22:11:56] <iank> And, I don't think we really know where that trend leads
[22:12:10] <iank> From that perspective, do you have any thoughts?

[22:13:23] <RSeddon> devinu: That's a Lessig-ism. From 'Remix'. Culture shared among people versus culture broadcast to a passive audience who aren't supposed to *do* anything with it.
[22:14:05] <thomzane> I would say the only functional difference between Copilot and EleutherAI is that EleutherAI clearly defines their training set and that it can be self-hosted.  Both have the same issues with copyright inputs becoming public domain outputs.
[22:14:29] <isf> ggoes who i need send a mail for put me in a newslatter of spanish fsf  bulleting or something like that?
[22:14:35] <RSeddon> iank: Maybe there's also the trend towards consolidation of so much of online culture on a few big platforms. 
[22:15:06] <iank> I agree that has also been a trend
[22:15:18] <ggoes> isf: if you mean receiving the spanish supporter, there should be a link in the latest english supporter. look for the only line in spanish
[22:15:41] <isf> ok thanks you ggoes, and yes that is the issue thanks
[22:16:29] <devinu> RSeddon: I have yet to read Lessig's book, I will admit, but it is on my list.
[22:17:17] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[22:17:32] <RSeddon> Maybe some of the reaction does come from the fact it's Microsoft behind Copilot, and there's a history there...
[22:17:58] <iank> Yes, I think that is the case.
[22:18:04] <devinu> not just the history
[22:18:06] <isf> how i can do it ggoes the web page: "https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/member-dashboard/communications" dont work for me
[22:18:16] <devinu> I think it also has to do with expectations
[22:18:41] <devinu> Like, so many people held certain expectations for what Github was, and assumed it would be the same
[22:18:49] *** Quits: undt (~undt@cpc84379-newc18-2-0-cust110.16-2.cable.virginm.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[22:18:52] <devinu> And the rug was pulled from underneath
[22:19:10] <devinu> Surprise, now there are new expectations
[22:19:52] <RSeddon> That's true. There's a kind of sinking feeling that often comes when a service gets bought out by a corporate giant.
[22:20:01] <devinu> A lot of people may be thinking, "Is it worth it now to take my code off Github?" (assuming they disagree)
[22:20:41] <RSeddon> Some already did that when it was acquired.
[22:21:28] <iank> Well, copilot could take from places other than Github. I'm reminded of Software Heritage, which sucks up software from everywhere and computes things across all that software.
[22:21:30] <devinu> And some stayed, hoping that the implicit "terms of agreement" would stay the same
[22:21:31] <thomzane> Anyone can fork or mirror a free software project onto another forge such as GitHub.
[22:21:45] <iank> copilot could use the more expansive software heritage set of software
[22:22:05] <devinu> thomzane: yes, they could
[22:23:20] <devinu> We are going to wrap up in a few minutes
[22:23:31] <devinu> Any final questions?
[22:23:46] <RSeddon> There are ideas floating around about platforms' responsibilities to users: terms like 'information fiduciaries' and 'data stewardship'. Mainly academic so far though, I think.
[22:23:48] <devinu> And then, maybe, we allow RSeddon to give us some final thoughts?
[22:24:04] <zleap> hi
[22:24:07] <devinu> RSeddon: links please, as reference 
[22:24:12] <devinu> zleap: hi
[22:24:33] <iank> To me, one troubling part is whether gpt-3 (which took millions of dollars in computing resources, and copilot is based on), has something of a very different kind of accuracy or helpfulness due to all cpu power it used. Another paper the FSF didn't publish mainly spent the whole paper making a technical argument that that isn't the case, that cheaper models can compete.
[22:24:38] <RSeddon> Okay, links in a moment...
[22:25:03] <iank> Reading that was relieving to me, because I think it was relatively persuasive
