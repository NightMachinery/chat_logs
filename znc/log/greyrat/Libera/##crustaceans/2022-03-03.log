[03:08:38] <skyl4rk> I want to be able to serialize state down to notes spread around my desk and return to them the next day. I want my potted plant. Oh but I can still have those if I work from home, but will I get increased pay since the company will now encroach 10%+ of my home?

[21:52:27] <kline> hes exactly the sort of person you want maintaining a free software version of matlab

[21:59:59] <gwozniak> It's clear that he'd rather complain than adjust to or attempt to mitigate the situation.  I'm no mac apologist, but the potshots are juvenile
[22:19:56] <kronk> jordi looks like the kind of guy you'd find defending RMS.
[22:22:11] <kronk> qq: what would you rather participate in, a competition judging how fast you can compute 1k digits of pi on a raspi 4, or a competition judging most creative calculation of 1k digits of pi on a raspi 4.

[22:32:13] <kronk> reason I ask is fucking nerds in the makerspace that I used to support are making a "how fast can you calculate pi on a pi4" contest.
[22:32:29] <kronk> with support for a freestyle entry (but they can't win).
[22:32:46] <kronk> they're trying to market this contest to the general public, focusing it on high-schoolers.
[22:32:53] <kronk> this is boring as fuck.
[22:33:29] <kronk> why can't anybody understand what makes stuff like this fun in general. it's far more entertaining seeing how crafty people can be with their outputs.
[22:33:45] <kronk> and potential inputs.
[22:34:13] <kronk> the worst part, gwozniak, is that they mandate a series expansion.
[22:34:18] <kronk> you can't use the arctan method.
[22:34:40] <kronk> so there is a confined upper bound on complexity because you have to cut the expansion off at some point, and I think you can even calculate that point.
[22:34:55] <kronk> it's really stupid. these people don't know how to make computing fun.
