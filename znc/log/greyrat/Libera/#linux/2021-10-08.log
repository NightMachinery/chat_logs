[03:13:27] <JanC> but IIRC it's no longer supported by upstream, so getting it fixed might be difficult

[03:14:04] <jcbjoe2021> let me install again and see what happens

[03:14:42] <JanC> akk: it used to be, but IIRC it's deprecated

[05:04:16] *** Joins: allorder (allorder@user/allorder)
[05:04:18] <Psi-Jack> Well, that's. Not entirely true./
[05:04:31] <ayecee> that's a paddlin'
[05:04:32] <Dagmar> It's strictly a matter of how an ISO is constructed that dictates whether or not you can write it to a disk and have it actually boot
[05:05:03] <Dagmar> Disk images will generally behave fine when written to a thumbdrive because they're all block storage
[05:06:47] <MinusOne> Dagmar, so my goal is creating an iso that can then be used as a bootable image, but what I am working with is the bootable thumb drive. Just dd'ing is kinda working. So should I now learn how to make a proper iso to get reliable results?
[05:06:58] <Psi-Jack> Ventoy is a grub configuration builder for setting up a USB thumbdrive containing and booting multiple different ISO's. But it's not perfect at it.

[05:07:35] <Dagmar> Ventoy, YUMI, and some others can include an ISO in a thumbdrive, but that's largely because they've got a pretty flexible bootstrap in their toolkit
[05:07:52] <nawcom> iso9660 hybrid booting is an ISOLINUX feature only. it puts a functional mbr table on the image which works with block devices while being ignored when burned to optical media
[05:07:57] <ayecee> MinusOne: they usually are, and they're often written to shiny plastic disks
[05:07:58] <Psi-Jack> MinusOne: Those are ISO9660's with Rockridge extensions with a hybrid boot.
[05:08:07] <Dagmar> MinusOne: They're generally ISOs because they were mastered to be written to CDs and DVDs, which means they ahve rockridge extentions and so fotth
[05:08:13] <koala_man> could be a ISO 9293 image
[05:08:17] <Dagmar> s/fotth/forth/
[05:08:31] <MinusOne> Okay, so I need to learn how to make those probably, then. Now I have some terminology to help research, awesome
[05:08:38] <ayecee> nah
[05:08:40] <nawcom> a windows iso or *bsd iso or any other iso aren't bootable when dded to storage drives
[05:08:42] <Dagmar> Lacking Rock Ridge extensions, you're not going to have much luck with an optical drive recognizing the media
[05:08:59] <Psi-Jack> MinusOne: Are you ... Where's Ventoy come into play here?
[05:09:22] <MinusOne> Psi-Jack, what I have is bootable thumb drives. What I want is to turn them into images I can then boot using Ventoy
[05:09:27] <nawcom> https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid
[05:09:30] <Dagmar> The images that can be flashed to thumbdrives or hard drives _or_ burned to optical media are generally referred to as "hybrid" imaegs
[05:09:31] <MinusOne> what I have tried is dd, which is not working perfectly
[05:09:45] <Psi-Jack> MinusOne: What /are/ the bootable thumb drives?
[05:10:11] <MinusOne> particular killdisk images, which I am required by the company I work for to use for wiping drives
[05:10:20] <Dagmar> That's why I'm trying to point out to you that an ISO may or may _not_ be a hybrid image, and if it's not a hybrid image, it won't be useful to flash it to a thumbdrive or block storage device

[05:15:15] <Dagmar> So long as you don't lose your mind and try to start the partition table on sector 0 (there's a good reason they start on sector 2048 generally) the space where the MBR from a BIOS partition table and bootstrap live are just not used
[05:15:41] <Dagmar> Hence you will occasionally encounter a disk with a partition starting at sector zero and ending at 2047 which is labeled type "BIOS boot"
[05:15:59] <Dagmar> This just makes it _easier_ to keep the two mechanisms in sync
[05:16:32] <Dagmar> ...because you're generally going to need both a classic partition table and a GPT partition table, and may god have mercy on your data if the two don't have matching start and end sector numbers

[08:35:35] <bblinky> Hello, so I have just paid for a kimsufi dedicated server where I'd like to install univention on, I have been googleing a bit to try to figure out how I would go about installing a custom ISO on the box but all the guides I found so far is about doing it with KVM which seems to need vx-t, which my box's cpu does not support... Ifigured someone in here might have an idea about how to approach this

[08:37:56] <kirk781> bblinky, I had half a dozen useless entries in the UEFI bootloader option and it was defaulting there instead of GRUB. I assumed restarting from scratch will solve the problem. IN the midst did I realise that the solution was just to manually delete those entries from the BIOS and NOT wiping the fsckin bootloader

[08:44:38] <KillerWasp> always falling into the same partition sounds like a user error.

[08:45:03] <kirk781> KillerWasp, there wasn't a partition issue. It was a grub issue. Eitherways, I am sure that someone more capable than me could have spotted the problem at that failing initramfs instance and did the work

[10:05:58] <hexnewbie> jiffe: It's common to close all fds after the special 0,1,2 when you fork something that should not inherit them. E.g. in ssh closefrom(3) is a common call, so would it be in any servers that work in a similar manner.

[11:56:37] <Psi-Jack> One thing you could try, though, I doubt this will be of much use, but still. Stop the VM, wait for it to be stopped, start the console, then use the console to start the VM, to which it will start the console to the new display, and then you can try F8, whatever that's supposed to do. But, again, doubt it'll be of much help. But far better than what your process was to try to get early on keystrokes during boot. 🙂

[15:27:28] <PaulFertser> siwica`: that's to be expected. Also please take into account ifconfig is a tool using old ioctls and instead "ip" should be used for all manipulations (it's almost 20 years since it's the case).
[15:28:43] <siwica`> PaulFertser: Yes I know. I only used ifconfig as it was used in the first google result.
[15:29:03] <PaulFertser> siwica`: do you really need to simulate some tricky L2 devices? If not probably create pairs of "veth" interfaces and add all first elements of each pair in one bridge, and the others use for your custom software.
[15:29:49] <siwica`> Since I just did some netlink stuff myself I could also directly communicate with the kernel via a netlink socket if iproute2 does not support any required features.

[17:48:50] <Psi-Jack> genoobie: Then configure a static IP in the boot config file on the PI
[17:48:56] <ayecee> genoobie: i guess check the dhcp server logs
[17:48:57] <analoq> i find the overhead more cumbersome than it's added value

[17:49:12] <Psi-Jack> Then you're SOL
[17:49:17] <analoq> with wine i can simply create a small start script and start the game with one command from the commandline

A jankier solution is having it run a cron script where it sends its network details (i.e., ip addr ) to a remote server like once per minute, that you can manually check

[19:33:06] <TheGuestMovie> I could use some help. My objective is compiling a program in a chroot that has a much older version of gcc/libs. I googled a bit, and people seem to be using chroots for this. More specifically, the convenience tool schroot. I'm new to chroots, I seem to have gotten the jist of it, I just can't figure out how to actually call executables inside
[19:33:06] <TheGuestMovie> the chroot like gcc5, on source files outside the chroot. https://paste.debian.net/plain/1214776
[19:33:52] <ayecee> wouldn't be much of a chroot if you could access resources outside it, from inside it

[19:35:17] <ayecee> i'm afraid not with chroots. possibly with filesystem namespaces, but i don't know a lot about that.

[20:18:43] <nova> greetings. Q about virtualbox. When I try to add .vmdk file as hard disk, I get VERR_ACCESS_DENIED. The permissions on the file are fine, so I suspect it has something to do with something else. tl;dr /dev/nvme0n1p1 is boot partition, n1p2 is linux swap, n1p3 is Linux ext4 partition, and /dev/nvme0n1p4 is Windows partition that I have created. I am on arch linux so /dev/nvme0n1p4 is not mounted

[20:30:06] <nova> sheet. adding user to disk group helped, but then I started VM and got "not a bootable disk". I am confused because /dev/nvme0n1p1 has two bootloaders (grub and Windows). I don't know how that happened exactly, but it did. Should I be adding /dev/nvme0n1p1 instead of n1p4 so I can boot windows? I am confuzzled

[21:19:10] <tirnanog> steerpike: anyway, to see a non-zero value in either the active/inactive column implies that the packet is at least being forwarded in the expected manner from that host.
[21:19:23] <rymdkraft> Dagmar: oh really? I never tried restarting firefox

[21:22:48] <uwu> nope
[21:23:18] <Guest3256> rymdkraft: ah, then also maybe restart the session too
[21:23:26] <Dagmar> So change it so that it does and don't (UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES) change the starting sector, or allow the partitioning tool to remove a "signature"
[21:23:38] <uwu> can i do this w/o reboot
[21:23:46] <uwu> or do i have to make a new partition
[21:23:48] <Pentode> rymdkraft: maybe you can find something in extensions/themes in firefox's settings that goes with it a bit better
[21:23:49] <Dagmar> Once you've done that, `partprobe /dev/sda && pvresize /dev/sda1`
[21:23:55] <Dagmar> You can do this without a reboot
[21:24:01] <Dagmar> It's actually really easy
[21:24:11] <Guest3256> rymdkraft: close browser, close windows manager session, and start WM session
[21:24:25] <Dagmar> The first step is to enlarge the physical volume container (the LVM partition) to take on the unused space

[21:25:00] <Dagmar> That's because /dev/sda is the disk.

[21:25:36] <Dagmar> Basically, you _can_ change the partition table of a disk that's in use, but the kernel has to be _told_ to go re-read the partition table
[21:25:59] <uwu> oo
[21:26:16] <uwu> so i just partprobe and it will update?

[21:57:52] <akk> Dagmar: It does -- if you're lucky enough to have a phone that gets OS updates. Most people are probably walking around unpatched for years.
[21:58:14] <Guest3256> windows and android treat users like if they were ignorant and silly
[21:58:19] <Dagmar> akk: That's why I try and get them running Lineage if they're using an older device
[21:58:37] <Dagmar> Guest3256: That's because most users are ignorant and silly
[21:58:58] <akk> Dagmar: Yeah, that was the biggest reason I wanted to try lineage, but that's only an option on a relatively small number of devices.
[21:59:17] <Dagmar> It's a pretty respectable portion of the mainstream devices out ther etho

[22:00:03] <Dagmar> On an S5?
[22:00:10] <akk> On some carriers it's possible, but not on verizon which is the only carrier in a lot of  the rural US.

[22:01:58] <Guest3256> Dagmar: society needs knowledge; the only way is educating them not putting down the standard. Compare Windows with Linux. On the second one, apart from being very secure on design (made by soft makers), you learn a lot by just using it.
[22:02:11] <Dagmar> Guest3256: I do not care what you think about this
[22:02:17] <klys> manugau, look for inputs being removed like keyboards and other event stuff towards the bottom
[22:02:36] <akk> Just getting that S5 to update was a process that required windows or mac, but they stopped shipping updates for it anyway so it was moot.
[22:02:47] <akk> OS updates, that is.

[23:06:59] <oerheks> seriously, you ask about memory speed //
[23:07:19] <Dagmar> If I'm remembering correctly it's something like you have to have only two-layer PCBs (and thusly fewer chips with higher capacity) before 3200 becomes a safe speed because the thicker PCB with more chips makes it impossible to keep them all in synch
[23:07:26] <pikajude> the only thing i asked about memory speed was whether running it at 2133 is okay
[23:07:42] <Dagmar> You can run 3200-rated RAM at 2133, no problem
[23:07:53] <pikajude> i don't care about speed right now, i just want to get them detected
[23:07:57] <pikajude> then i can worry about speed later

[23:39:08] <rascul> maybe try #devops
[23:39:16] <tomreyn> rednaZ[m]: you may end up in grub cli if you hit escape more than once during boot.
[23:39:41] <ayecee> pikajude: for what it's worth, it looks like they should be put in A2/B2, but i can't yet see a reason why it would detect only 32GB.

[23:40:08] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[23:40:11] <pikajude> i was using a2 + b2 when i had 2x8GB

[23:40:18] <rednaZ[m]> There must be a way of adding the `noresume` boot option in my situation, must there not?
[23:40:35] <Dagmar> Yes.  There is.  It involves using your keyboard.
[23:40:36] <ayecee> pikajude: oh, have i misunderstood? i thought you had just two modules. you have 4?
[23:40:43] <pikajude> yeah, i did have two modules
[23:40:45] <pikajude> now i have 4
[23:40:49] <pikajude> because i bought new ram because i wanted more ram
[23:40:54] <rednaZ[m]> Dagmar: I have a keyboard.
[23:40:55] <pikajude> it's 4 new modules, they're all identical
[23:40:58] <Dagmar> ayecee: And you were resisting the temptation to tell him he'd only bought 32Gb of RAM?
[23:41:04] <Dagmar> heh
[23:41:19] <rednaZ[m]> Dagmar: Please tell me how to or where to look it up.
[23:41:23] <tomreyn> rednaZ[m]: i don't think it will make a difference whether you get to the grub menu directly or return to it form the CLI really. but, as dagmar suggested, if you generally end up on the grub CLI by default, this is not how it should be (and this could hint at a problem related to how grub is installed - but that'd be a separate topic)
[23:41:30] <ayecee> no, the part number he gave was for a 32GB module and he reported there should be 64GB showing up
[23:41:46] <pikajude> yeah, when i said i gave the wrong part number, it was because the part number i gave was wrong
[23:42:13] <rascul> full of wrong information
[23:42:17] <ayecee> pikajude: i don't follow. you have 4 modules. what are their sizes?
[23:42:21] <pikajude> 16
[23:42:22] <Betal> pikajude: the bios show the 64GB ?
[23:42:24] <Dagmar> rednaZ[m]: You were pretty close.  You _do_ need to hit 'e' at the grub menu to edit whatever option you were going to pick, but you have to put " noresume" at the end of line that lists the kernel with all the parameters (which will have things like "quiet splash" already on the end)... NOT just at the bottom of the entire section
[23:42:25] <pikajude> yes
[23:42:29] <ayecee> pikajude: they are all 16GB?
[23:42:31] <pikajude> the bios shows 64G, as does dmidecode
[23:42:43] <pikajude> the part number is f4-3200C16Q-64GVK (for real this time)
[23:42:44] <rascul> what doesn't show 64G?
[23:42:49] <pikajude> the operating system
[23:42:50] <Gustavo6046> Dagmar: funny, it seems that simply commenting out the static address assignment ('Address=...' under [IPv4]) in the iwd file for the network (/var/lib/iwd/JUPITER2G.iwd) suddenly made all the network wonkiness disappear.
[23:42:55] <rascul> how have you determined that?
[23:42:57] <Gustavo6046> And it NEVER occured to me that this could happen.

[23:43:52] <Dagmar> Not unless your machine's incredibly hosed
[23:43:57] <Gustavo6046> I'll still run dhcpcd for v6. Should I tell dhcpcd to not get IPv4?

[23:54:37] <ayecee> Dagmar: so, that's the problem here?
[23:54:51] <Dagmar> ayecee: Probably the stick geometry

[23:55:05] <ayecee> nomagno[m]: we see you
[23:55:09] <Dagmar> Very likely falling afoul of some bug in the motherboard firmware
[23:55:27] <rednaZ[m]> Dagmar: The prompt is not `rescue` but `grub`, by the way.
[23:55:29] <ayecee> Dagmar: i don't follow. would this be a bug, or would it be expected behavior?
[23:55:37] <tirnanog> MrMobius: indeed, it should transfer all of them unless you have specified otherwise. nevertheless, these checks are performed and ni parallel to the transfer process.

[23:55:44] <Dagmar> These issues were always around, you just didn't nearly as often have people packing 64Gb into their workstations
[23:55:46] <tomreyn> pikajude: for a uefi booting system, as well as for recent hardware, use memtest86.com's memtest instead of the open source one
[23:56:13] <Dagmar> ayecee: Technically a bug, but an expected behaviour for everyone who has been trying to build machines in teh last 2 years
[23:56:20] <Dagmar> Its a real pain in the ass
[23:56:26] <pikajude> ok, time to try memtest
[23:56:33] *** Quits: Toadisattva (~Toadisatt@gateway/tor-sasl/toadisattva) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:56:34] <ayecee> ah. bios upgrade might help then?
[23:56:42] <Betal> hmm, isn't the 0x0000000100000000-0x000000083f37ffff supose to be the 32GB you see?
[23:56:51] <pikajude> but it says "usable" in my log
[23:56:57] <pikajude> it doesn't say "reserved"
[23:56:59] <tirnanog> MrMobius: the default method is to check whether the file exists and, if so, whether its size or mtime differs. I don't think it pulls any kind of short-circuiting stunts based on whether the receiving directory is empty.
[23:57:05] <Betal> pikajude: yes, but it end there

[23:58:14] <tomreyn> pikajude: yes. have you tried booting with a different linux distro's live system, did you see the full amount of ram there?
[23:58:29] <pikajude> yeah, i just booted with an archlinux live usb, it showed 32G still
[23:58:31] *** Joins: emf (~emf@2620:10d:c090:400::5:3586)
[23:58:36] <pikajude> although i can check the dmesg again...
[23:59:05] <tomreyn> okay, i just wanted to rule out it's the proxmox (pve9 patches
[23:59:11] <tomreyn> *(pve)
[23:59:40] <tirnanog> MrMobius: if the total numbers didn't match up, then it's probable that you didn't account for everything. tree excludes names that begin with a dot by default so that could be one potential reason.
[23:59:48] <tomreyn> maybe try resetting bios to optimized / manufacturer defaults
[23:59:59] <pikajude> ok, i can try that
