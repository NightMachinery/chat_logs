[01:05:43] <dana> i think i'll try to do a test release for 5.9 this coming week, maybe as soon as tomorrow
[01:05:51] <dana> if anybody has anything they want to go in before that, please do the needful
[01:06:00] <Mikachu> did we fix everything?
[01:06:10] <dana> guess i need to figure out if it will in fact be called 5.9, seems we were kind of tied on that question
[01:06:18] <dana> yeah it'll be the last one
[01:06:44] <Mikachu> i think everyone was indifferent except daniel was for 5.9
[01:07:00] <Mikachu> but that might be a lie
[01:07:47] <dana> pws and bart weren't pushing hard but they did seem to lean to 6.0
[01:08:10] <dana> axel seemed to agree with daniel, though idk what weight his opinion carries amongst the team
[01:08:14] <Mikachu> i guess we abandoned the odd-y = unstable scheme a while ago
[01:08:55] <Mikachu> maybe a major version bump will encourage distros to upgrade before 5 years this time
[01:09:21] <dana> it is unfortunate that we've missed the window for ubuntu 22.04
[01:09:36] <dana> i think maybe there's still time for bullseye though
[01:09:50] <dana> er, not bullseye, what's the next one
[01:09:57] <Mikachu> i guess we can at least wait for the non-multibyte pattern incr search crash fix
[01:10:14] <dana> oh are you still working that out
[01:10:21] <Mikachu> looked like mostly bart was on that
[01:10:30] <Mikachu> (49955)
[01:10:39] <dana> yeah
[01:11:00] <Mikachu> my patch was for multibyte pattern incr search crash ;)
[01:11:23] <Mikachu> although it wasn't crashing at that point, it just didn't work at all
[01:11:23] <dana> ah
[01:11:34] <Mikachu> or maybe it did crash, i forget
[01:11:48] <Mikachu> it seems to both work and not crash now which is ideal
[01:12:47] <dana> did you look at bart's most recent patch? are we just waiting for the comment period to expire before it goes in or is there something else
[01:13:00] <Mikachu> i think the num i posted is for the patch in question?
[01:13:07] <dana> yes
[01:13:15] <Mikachu> i'm just waiting
[01:13:21] <Mikachu> i'm not entirely clear on our process ;)
[01:13:28] <dana> ah
[01:13:34] <Mikachu> i usually just post a patch and wait a while before pushing to give everyone a chance to complian
[01:13:42] <dana> yeah
[01:14:40] <dana> i feel like tying up loose ends like that might be part of my job as rm but i'm putting us in a weird position because aside from still being the rm i've been semi-checked out of zsh dev for a year or two now

[03:17:18] <dana> the feature where fastmail lets you specify headers to always show on messages is p useful for the ml
[03:17:45] <dana> i assume other clients let you do stuff like that but none that i've used
[03:19:05] <Mikachu> cool, if i tabcomplete 'man apache' and then erase the e and tabcomplete again, i get a seggfault
[03:19:19] <dana> i don't think it should do that
[03:19:25] <dana> on master?
[03:20:29] <Mikachu> perhaps
[03:21:06] <Mikachu> heh, man 2 2<tab> crashes, but man 1 1<tab> does not
[03:21:27] <Mikachu> i am slightly (very) concerned this is because of my deduplication patch
[03:22:57] <dana> i'll build and try on mine
[03:24:36] <Mikachu> hmm, man doesn't use -V or nosort so i'm probably safe...
