[00:24:23] <mickey8> b0nn yeah that's what im about to end up doing. what parameters do you use to see if it's the "same" request? it's easy for GET but for POST you should be considering the body of the request
[00:24:55] <lungaro> When are generics? Is it go 1.18?
[00:25:00] <b0nn> what parameters?
[00:25:11] <b0nn> Um, that's a business logic question
[00:25:11] *** Joins: GJdan (~quassel@107-190-26-133.cpe.teksavvy.com)
[00:25:51] <b0nn> ie. time since that endpoint was hit by that IP, or by that session (session key in the request) or time in general
[00:26:11] <ikke> And POST requests are often not idempotent
[00:26:19] <ikke> (You should assume they are not)
[00:26:24] <b0nn> the latter is "we return cached for all queries when the cache is younger than X
[00:26:28] <mickey8> i mean determine when to pull from cache (and where). like, i decided to cache a specific route, and let's say we're doing it very simple and store in memory, so there's some map[string]interface{}, where string is a hash of the path or (path,body) and the result is in the interface, right?
[00:27:38] <mickey8> then on the next request, there's a key of the hash of path or path,body or whatever which can be pulled and served, otherwise move to next handler
[00:28:10] <mickey8> assuming my logic is correct so far, what would you consider in the hash other than the path (and the body for a POST request)?
[00:30:13] <mickey8> and the next problem that i have no idea how to solve is how do you do this without applying 2 handlers - one before the request is actually processed (to serve cached results) and one after (to save results to cache)?

[00:41:28] <mickey8> i'm aware. never mind that, i'll figure that one out. can you give me a hitn on the other question?
[00:42:44] <b0nn> what other question?
[00:42:50] <seebs> usually, there's a handler which (1) checks cache, (2) failing that, does the thing and stores the result in the cache before returning it
[00:43:41] <b0nn> oh usually I have the handler check if the cache needs to be used or not, and, if not grab the fresh data then update the cache and return
[00:43:44] <j416> mickey8: don't forget the mutex
[00:44:13] <j416> (perhaps wrap your map in something with methods that hide the mutex stuff so you won't miss it)
[00:44:43] <j416> also don't forget to expire your cache as needed
[00:44:57] <j416> (if there's a risk it'll grow forever)
[00:44:59] <mickey8> so the cache handler itself calls the api functions? because right now the api functions are handlers here
[00:45:33] <mickey8> i mean it makes sense if the api functions are the 'next' handlers after the cache handler, but then how would it even know what the newer result was
[00:46:13] <j416> mickey8: handler() { if val, ok := cache.Get(key); ok { (respond with val and return) } (regular implementation) cache.Set(key, val) (respond with val and return) }
[00:46:37] <b0nn> I like to seperate things, handler functions orchestrate to an extent
[00:47:20] <b0nn> but the logic for this seems to belong at handler level as it's a handler that's choosing which data source to use
[00:47:47] <b0nn> it could be in the code called by the handler and the handler never needs to know that a cached value is being returned too

[00:48:04] <j416> ^
[00:48:09] <j416> sometimes it makes sense to cache a bit higher up
[00:48:33] <j416> for example, your response may be dependent on the current time
[00:49:00] <mickey8> maybe i wasnt explaining myself well. i understand the cache handler, that's fine. im asking about how the cache handler would know the new result, considering right now it just checks the cache and then next.servehttp if no cache is found?
[00:49:10] <j416> in this case it might make more sense to cache data higher up, and filter based on time later, each and ever time
[00:49:11] <j416> every*
[00:50:35] <j416> mickey8: in that case the only way I can imagine would be to intercept the write and then forward it to the real response writer
[00:50:51] <j416> but, seems like a bit of a hassle
[00:51:18] <j416> easier to just put a cdn in front of the service and set proper cache headers

[11:59:09] <acagastya> Hi, when using `http.Get` method to fetch a URL, is there a way to pass on query parameters to the URL, xor am I supposed to hard code it?
[12:01:37] <acagastya> Like for example, I am supposed to call the endpoint `api.example.com` and query parameters include `client_id` and `response_type` -- should I be hardcoding those in the `http.Get` call?

[12:09:56] <KirkMcDonald> net/url has some stuff for formatting query parameters.

[15:23:11] <bookworm> just keep logic out of it and you'll be fine
[15:23:49] <bookworm> it should get pre massaged data and mostly loop and display. If you have lots of if else and function calls you're doing it wrong
[15:24:18] <bookworm> you have a perfectly functional language in go, no need to get fancy in the templates
[15:24:33] <iivvoo> well, display logic should be in there (imho), since the outer code shouldn't have to know/bother too much with which specific details the templates need - e.g. even/odd first/last
[15:24:50] <bookworm> sure, but that's easy
[15:25:11] <iivvoo> no it's not - it's rather non-obvious

[16:16:32] <bookworm> as in the functional style / js world?
[16:17:27] <bookworm> because just for programming on the fly you can just make it a single string in and out function and write it on 2 lines
[16:17:59] <bookworm> usually if you have a variadic function you want to concatenate / reduce it eventually
[16:18:15] <dntreou> Hello everyone, I am using the following function https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#WalkDir from filepath package, I have come across something peculiar, Walkdir is able to crawl the directory I have provided ( dummy directory with random files  I created ) but when I retrieve a folder struture from the server to test it on it does not crawl that directory, I even tried to chmod to 777 for the sake
[16:18:18] <dntreou> of it, also the directory and all its sub directories and files belong to my user/usergroup. Any clues as to why would walkdir not work on the retrieved dir
[16:18:18] <acagastya> I can think of it as a map -- but no, I was just curious if like how we havea variadic function, we can have a return like that or not.
[16:18:50] <bookworm> it's just syntactic sugar, your function receives a slice

[16:19:23] <bookworm> it's simply a convenience for the caller
[16:19:46] <acagastya> Yes.  The function is getting too big, and I was thinking if I could somehow simplify it, if this was possible.
[16:21:29] <acagastya> Also out of curiosity, bookwork, like in js, we can declare constants as `const [foo, bar] = [1, 2]` -- is something like that possible in golang? -- I know it is just a syntactic sugar and my primitive guess will be -- that is a very slow operation, but is it possible to?
[16:22:13] <acagastya> My whole point of using golang was because syntactic sugar taxes code-execution, but this can come handy for simple debugging.
[16:22:54] <bookworm> go doesn't have tuple unpacking like that, whatever it's called in js land... structural assignment something

[20:44:27] <ikke> not that I'm aware of at least, _test files get skipped by the regular build process
[20:45:16] <davidkrauser> ikke, hmm, that's what I thought. I know `go test` has the `-c` flag to avoid running the tests after compilation, but it doesn't look like that works when you want to build multiple tests
[20:45:23] <dostoyevsky2> ldiamond: I wrote myself and Api that works like ReadYaml("y.yaml").First().M()["key"].S()
[20:46:52] <explodes> ldiamond: if performance is not a concern, shell out to `jq` otherwise, write the marshalling yourself
[20:47:02] <ikke> gojq exists

[21:21:51] <fizzie> Right, but it's designed for building a binary file for you.
[21:21:53] <fizzie> "-c: Compile the test binary to pkg.test but do not run it (where pkg is the last element of the package's import path). The file name can be changed with the -o flag."
[21:22:17] <davidkrauser> that's right :-)
[21:22:42] <davidkrauser> My initial question was: is there a way to do something like a `go build ./...` that will build everything (including files with the _test.go suffix)?
[21:22:42] <fizzie> If it did accept multiple packages, you'd end up with a lot of "foo.test" files in the current directory, some of which would probably have overlapping names, which does feel a little odd.

[23:09:35] <LambdaComplex> i swear i read stuff online saying/suggesting that you can't unmarshal from yaml into a time.Duration, but i just tried it and it worked
[23:09:37] <LambdaComplex> so....yay
[23:13:32] <henko> i'm fighting with the same program working on my private laptop but not on my companys
[23:13:43] <henko> laptop*
[23:19:52] <b0nn> henko: then give your laptop to your employer :)
[23:20:40] <henko> huh if it was /that/ easy
[23:23:36] <b0nn> well, if you need some help, you'll have to give to get - people will want to know what the problem is, how the environments differ, etc

[23:29:03] <henko> i'm trying to connect to a remote busybox-ish environment (embedded system) via SSH, execute some program and grabbing the STDOUT. This guy doesn't have an API so I have to get some metrics via CLI
[23:29:27] <henko> when trying it locally with 127:1 and user+pass it works
[23:29:39] <henko> but using the real IP doesn't
[23:29:50] <henko> it works however via putty from my company machine

[23:44:09] <bpalmer> henko: so if you run it on your machine, it connects successfully; when run on the  company machine, it times out? That sounds like your work probably has limits on outgoing network connections or a firewall
[23:44:49] <bpalmer> henko: you'll probably want to check with your work's network administrators and see if you can successfully do this connection "by hand" before you try to automate it
[23:46:33] <henko> when running it on my private machine with localhost ist work. when connecting via putty to the machine with IP 1.2.3.4 it works with user+pass (no ssh key). when doing 'go run' with the same program like on my private machine but with localhost exchanged with IP 1.2.3.4. it just timeouts?
[23:46:55] <henko> ist = it does
[23:47:19] <zsnes> are you expecting go run to somehow know your ssh user/pass?
[23:47:45] <zsnes> or to even negotiate ssh for you automatically?
[23:49:50] <henko> but I changed the user, pass and IP in the code which I posted above
[23:50:39] <henko> I just have massive ??? above my head. Why can I connect via putty to the machine flawlessy, but the go program can't?
[23:50:55] <henko> It should not be a firewall problem
[23:51:10] <henko> and im executing directly in powershell and not WSL2
[23:52:15] <henko> I do 'go run sshrequest.go'
[23:52:39] <henko> and no warnings or errors are displayed in VScode
[23:53:10] <bpalmer> I see. Try to capture a trace of the network traffic and see if they're tryin to connect to the same things.
