[05:21:44] <puff> Hi, looking for some advice about gmail.  Specifically, I'm trying to clean out my old email and free up space.  What I'd like to do is list all of the "From:" email addresses and a count of how many emails I have from each address, sorted from most to least.
[05:39:09] <bremner> puff: and you want to do that on the gmail web interface?
[05:42:56] <puff> bremner: Not especially in the web interface, but whichever way is most expeditious.
[05:43:18] <puff> I have thunderbird set up to pull all the message via IMAP, probably that's a better tool?  But I also don't use thunderbird much.
[05:43:21] <puff> I miss elm :-)
[05:43:34] <puff> And mutt.
[05:43:43] <puff> Though I liked elm better than mutt.
[05:47:34] <bremner> puff: if you have all the messages in a maildir, then an indexing/query tool like mu or notmuch could probably do what you want. Or just judicious use of grep. But I don't know how thunderbird stores things.
[05:50:45] <puff> Yeah, if it were all in a maildir I could just write a script to grind through it all.
[05:50:45] <puff> Hm.
[05:51:31] <puff> Hm, google search results suggest thunderbird uses mbox.
[05:51:34] <puff> Whee, blast from the past.
[05:52:10] <puff> Hey, there's a Maildir plugin for thunderbird.
[05:52:24] <puff> https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Maildir
[05:53:04] <lunaphyte> i might recommend using something like offlineimap, and gnu mailutils
[05:53:14] <puff> lunaphyte: Thanks, yeah, I might have to do that.
[05:53:31] <puff> I mainly have thunderbird set up to extract my content from quora.com.
[05:53:51] <puff> Due to GDPR, quora has an option to get all your content -- but as a bunch of zip files sent via email.
[05:54:24] <puff> There's a thunderbird plugin that can bulk extract email attachments, so I used that.

[17:20:29] <ychaouche> Hello everybody
[17:21:55] <ychaouche> I've just had a thought for a moment. Could firewalls use blocklists just like anti-spam software do ? 
[17:28:09] <lunaphyte> sure, that's typically what email firewalls do

[18:02:22] <ychaouche> this seems interresting : https://github.com/firehol/firehol/wiki/dnsbl-ipset.sh
[18:02:28] *** Quits: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:03:13] <ychaouche> instead of feeding your firewall with ipsets beforehand, you create a script that parses your firewall logs for incoming IPs and query the blocklists for those IPs
[18:03:43] <lunaphyte> oh, you're talking about a network firewall, not an email firewall?
[18:04:39] <ychaouche> I'm not aware there were many types of firewall. For my setup it will be the linux firewall, netfilter I guess
[18:05:10] <ychaouche> It might be useful on the system where the mail server runs
[18:05:34] <ychaouche> and, yes, I was thinking about my mail server's firewall
[18:06:11] <ychaouche> That would also be useful on the webmail server (same machine)
[18:06:18] <lunaphyte> meaning you are running a network firewall on your mail server.  versus the email firewall itself
[18:06:52] <ychaouche> I don't know what e-mail firewall is. Network firewall like physical appliance to defend your whole network ? 
[18:07:07] <ychaouche> ASA, fortinet etc. ? 
[18:07:14] <Friithian> sounds like something you could integrate into fail2ban
[18:07:44] <ychaouche> or earlier
[18:07:52] <ychaouche> or in parallel
[18:08:59] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:08:59] <lunaphyte> ychaouche: an email firewall is the email server which handles the initial incoming connections and traffic from the internet [or other untrusted network]
[18:12:48] <ychaouche> lunaphyte: ok got you. 
[18:12:54] <ychaouche> https://www.msp360.com/resources/blog/email-firewall-comparison/
[18:13:13] <ychaouche> [14:51] <ychaouche> I've just had a thought for a moment. Could firewalls use blocklists just like anti-spam software do ? 
[18:13:37] <lunaphyte> well, note that content filters and email firewalls are different things
[18:13:53] <ychaouche> I really meant : could I use blocklists directly on the system level (iptable or equivalent)
[18:14:05] <lunaphyte> a content filter would be next in line [but separate] from an email firewall

[20:21:43] <velix> Hi. Is anyone using Amazon SES? I need to send some (< 500) transaction mails a month and looking for a sold service, which doesn't cost $35 (like Mailgun etc.)
[20:22:00] <velix> My question: Does it work well?
[20:22:46] <lunaphyte> i have some limited experience with it.  imo, it's fine
[20:26:49] <velix> I'm sad that all those other services start at like 5,000 mails a month ;)

[20:34:35] <rob0> I guess transaction mail services only try once, and that has been a pain for me dealing with spammy ESPs like Sendgrid and Sparkpost.  They rightly are not listed in dnswl.org, so I greylist, and the mail never arrives.
[20:35:18] <velix> rob0: But I don't have another solution. A fresh IP address is bad for sending mails.
[20:36:14] <velix> Actually, their promises are fine: https://powertic.com/en/new-features-panel-aws-ses/
[20:36:22] <velix> and I wasn't able to detect bad words about SES.
