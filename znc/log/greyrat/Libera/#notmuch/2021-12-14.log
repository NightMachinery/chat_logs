[15:59:32] <bremner> jani: Domo: indentation patch on the list for your consideration
[16:00:21] <randomguest> Hi, I'm setting up notmuch on a brand new manjaro install and I'm getting an error on my first 'notmuch new' saying "Cannot open Xapian database at /path/to/maildir/.notmuch/xapian:Â  Couldn't detect type of database"
[16:00:22] <randomguest> This is after creating the xapian folder (I had a couldn't stat <path> error before that)
[16:00:22] <randomguest> Since it's a new install I expected it to create it
[16:00:44] <bremner> did you run notmuch new?
[16:01:00] <bremner> oic, you did
[16:01:09] <bremner> huh, well, that's not supposed to be necessary
[16:01:35] <bremner> in fact creating .notmuch manually is probably a bad idea
[16:02:22] <randomguest> ah, that could be it, I added a hook but I guess I should do that after the initial notmuch new
[16:02:51] <bremner> yeah, it's a bug I guess that notmuch is not more robust about this
[16:03:13] <randomguest> Yep that seems to have worked thanks for that :)
[16:03:19] <bremner> welcome

[16:20:23] *** Joins: sm2n (ae95cb1267@user/sm2n)
[16:23:33] <sm2n> Hello, I've been trying out notmuch (in emacs), and it's been nice. But I have a problem, which is that address autocompletion in message-mode does not work at all for me. No matter what I do, it says nothng matches. This is with the internal autocompletion method. notmuch address works from the command line, and running only notmuch with emacs -q did not help, so I'm at a loss at what to do and
[16:23:36] <sm2n> why this is happening.
[16:24:23] <bremner> sm2n: are you in message-mode or notmuch-message-mode?
[16:24:27] <sm2n> oh and this is on emacs 27.2, notmuch 0.34.1
[16:24:52] <sm2n> Message[Notmuch] mode defined in â€˜notmuch-mua.elâ€™:
[16:25:05] <bremner> ok. Are you using company or not?
[16:25:31] <sm2n> I traced notmuch-address-expand-name and it's being called, but it returns nil
[16:25:35] <sm2n> yes I am using company
[16:27:39] <bremner> iirc, first invocation is a bit odd, until it gets a cache built up.
[16:28:28] <sm2n> it says "No completion found" in the messages buffer no matter how many times I press tab
[16:28:59] <bremner> what is the value of notmuch-address-full-harvest-finished ?
[16:29:35] <sm2n> Its value is t
[16:30:06] <bremner> and the hash-table "notmuch-address-completions", does it look reasonable?
[16:30:32] <bremner> well, hard to say probably, but you can look at the entry count
[16:31:09] <sm2n> I'm not entirely sure how to inspect a hashtable
[16:31:14] <sm2n> but #<hash-table equal 0/65 0x1585ffad86e5> is probably bad?
[16:31:32] <sm2n> I assume 0/65 means 0 entries and 65 is the size
[16:31:32] <bremner> yeah, that doesn't look good
[16:32:17] <sm2n> I will trace notmuch-address-harvest and see what happens
[16:32:47] <bremner> sure. what is the value of notmuch-address-internal-completion? maybe there is an unhelpful filter
[16:33:51] <sm2n> Its value is (sent nil)
[16:34:36] <bremner> hmm. that's the default, so should not be the issue
[16:35:07] <sm2n> ok well tracing notmuch-address-harvest seems to have some useful information
[16:35:29] <sm2n> the addr-prefix argument going into it is nil, which I assume shouldn't be the case
[16:36:07] <sm2n> or wait nope, that's not true
[16:36:12] <sm2n> I wasn't reading the whole thing
[16:36:20] <sm2n> it is correctly sending the input along
[16:36:40] <bremner> did you run it synchronously? that's probably better for debugging
[16:37:28] <sm2n> no, is there a way to force that?
[16:37:42] <bremner> yes, an argument
[16:38:16] <sm2n> oh, you mean calling it manually
[16:38:19] <bremner> yes
[16:38:33] <sm2n> yeah I can do that
[16:40:11] <sm2n> so to be clear, if `$ notmuch address foo` returns results, then (notmuch-address-harvest foo t nil) should return non-nil?
[16:41:22] <bremner> I'm not sure the return-value is meaningful?
[16:42:27] <bremner> but it should update the hash table
[16:42:31] <sm2n> oh, I see
[16:43:03] <bremner> it's a bit ugly, mainly because of the async
[16:43:12] <bremner> or *shrug*.
[16:45:08] <sm2n> ok I think we're getting somewhere
[16:45:35] <sm2n> I traced notmuch-call-notmuch-sexp and now I can see the actual invocation of notmuch address
[16:45:48] <sm2n> the query it's sending is not what I expected
[16:46:25] <sm2n> it's searching for from me and to prefix
[16:46:39] <sm2n> rather than just the prefix
[16:49:44] <sm2n> hmm I think I have a larger misconfiguration
[16:49:58] <sm2n> my sent emails don't appear to be in my maildir
[16:50:27] <sm2n> I'm going to try to fix that, thanks for the help so far!
[16:50:33] <bremner> OK, good luck.
[17:10:17] <sm2n> ok, that did in fact fix it
[17:10:59] <sm2n> turns out you have to tell mbsync to sync everything or it will only sync your inbox
[17:11:10] <bremner> ah. Yeah, too many moving parts.
[17:11:42] <sm2n> thanks again
[17:12:05] <bremner> sure!
