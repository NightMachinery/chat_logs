[01:20:06] <rpav> "is a logging framework for C++ patterned after Apache log4j"
[01:20:59] <OnlineCop> I've got a template with this kind of signature: `template<typename T> bool getParam(std::string key, std::vector<T>& out) const { /* generic handling */ }` and would like to specialize when `T` is a `std::string`. Is there some notation I can use to restrict T's type at compile time?
[01:21:44] <rpav> http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/log4shell -> Log4shell is a command-line interface to log4cxx
[01:21:59] <PJBoy> specialise as in different behaviour for string, or as in no other type should compile?
[01:22:22] <OnlineCop> The current way I'm seeing this implemented is `bool getParam(std::string key, std::vector<std::string>& out) const { ... }` but was hoping to reuse 'T' in the body of the function instead of rewriting 'std::string' all over the place.
[01:22:43] <OnlineCop> Different behaviour for string; other types should compile using the generic handling.
[01:22:49] <PJBoy> right, you want constexpr if
[01:23:39] <rpav> or you could use the overload, and `using T = std::string;` at the top of your function
[01:23:39] <PJBoy> `template<typename T> void f(T arg) { if constexpr (std::is_same_v<T, std::string>) { /* string specific code */ } }` kinda code
[01:23:54] <rpav> if constexpr for that is kinda terrible
[01:24:16] <rpav> with the exception that you would want to do something _very_ specific for string, in addition to all the usual things
[01:24:43] <johnny> hmm.. if i ever get into needing more generic code (which i probably will at some point in my life) I'd like to see a kind of Q/A for solving problems just like was asked here
[01:24:49] <rpav> but probably if it's "getParam", you want to handle copying, or return a string_view, or something
[01:25:09] <OnlineCop> Most of the time, I'm pulling a vector of int or double from some map, and then testing that they fall between certain ranges. `std::string` would not have the range check, so I wanted to specialize that.
[01:25:20] <johnny> although i'd want to avoid out params
[01:25:31] <PJBoy> out parameters can be more efficient

[01:25:41] <PJBoy> I wouldn't take a hard stance against them
[01:25:46] <johnny> i would..
[01:26:01] <rpav> PJBoy: these days there's very little you'd need "out" parameters for though
[01:26:04] <OnlineCop> If the key isn't found, I want the out param to be unmodified; I only want to update it if the key exists.
[01:26:05] <johnny> it's like when i build a database, i always normalize it to the third normal form, but then denormalize if it becomes neessariy
[01:26:30] <PJBoy> that's not a hard stance against denormalising
[01:26:40] <PJBoy> so analogously you might use out parameters if it becomes necessary
[01:26:44] <johnny> basically.. don't write one until metrics tell you
[01:26:45] <PJBoy> in which case, cool
[01:26:55] <rpav> it seems everyone agrees .. it's a christmas miracle!

[01:28:42] <rpav> OnlineCop: ... ᴧ ... ... \o/
[01:29:22] <OnlineCop> How or where do I use the `if constexpr (std::is_same<...>)` in the definition?
[01:29:44] <OnlineCop> `template<typename T> bool getParam(std::string key, T& out) { if constexpr (std::is_same_v<T, std::string>) { /* string specific code */ } }` ?
[01:29:48] <PJBoy> wherever you need it
[01:30:00] <PJBoy> and the how is like that ^
[01:30:29] <OnlineCop> If constexpr() is false, wouldn't this be missing a `return` statement?
[01:30:46] <OnlineCop> Or do I need to `else if constexpr(...)` other conditions within the same body?
[01:31:19] <PJBoy> it works just like other if statements

[01:50:16] <manuels> On some linux systems this works. Can I generally design plugin based apps such that there is no library but only header files and the executable?
[01:50:16] <manuels> Can we use an executable file as shared library on all platforms(Windows, Mac, Linux)? Afaik this always works if the interface classes are interfaces in the sense that the only contain pure virtual functions. But can I also define classes in the interface containing symbols that have to be bound by linking against an executable containing them?
[01:50:16] <manuels> Use case: an executable foo, the app, offers plugins an interface through a shared library libfoo. Plugins (shared libs) are loaded at runtime. Both, the app and plugins, link against libfoo to resolve symbols in the classes both of them use. Is this necessary or can put the classes in the executable target and let the plugins link the executable
[01:50:16] <manuels> instead?
[01:50:48] <OnlineCop> RazielZ: If you update the line `std::cout << "destroying a foo" << std::endl;` to this: `std::cout << "destroying a foo for " << x << std::endl;` then you see the order of destruction.

[01:51:30] <OnlineCop> map.emplace() constructs the new object in-place with the arguments passed to the constructor, without using any move/copy.
[01:51:52] <rpav> OnlineCop: it will use move/copy if you explicitly pass something to move/copy
[01:51:56] <OnlineCop> map.operator[] copies the value in place, but uses copy/move.
[01:51:56] <manuels> sorry copy paste the order is wrong

[01:56:51] <RazielZ> rpav, right, I see. in my case it's a rather big-ish class and the destructor explicitly .clears some vectors, and even though they would be empty at that point it feels like a bit of unnecessary overhead

[05:54:54] <KombuchaKip> RandomReader: Do you think the WorkQueueManager's consumer threads, or the work std::function lambdas could benefit in any way from thread_local storage?
[05:56:23] <RazielZ> smallville7123, it returns an iterator, you can then get the element from that either as reference or as a copy
[05:57:40] <RandomReader> KombuchaKip - no, I only mentioned it as a place storage could be "hidden" and associated with the threads
[05:57:53] <RandomReader> relative to what you were trying to debug
[05:58:06] <KombuchaKip> RandomReader: Suggestions to how I might check?
[05:58:33] <RandomReader> it only mattered when it seemed to be related to threads being destructed, but since that's no longer true, it seems irrelevant
[05:58:46] <KombuchaKip> RandomReader: I don't know if it's even specific to TBB because I'm also seeing the same problem on a POWER9 machine (ppc64el) which, presumably, Intel's TBB isn't being used by libstdc++
[05:59:10] <KombuchaKip> RandomReader: No but it is. The memory appears to clean up on thread destruction.
[05:59:13] <RandomReader> libstdc++ doesn't have parallel STL without TBB
[05:59:29] <RandomReader> so if it's working at all, must be generic fallbacks, not just intel-cpu specific code
[05:59:37] <KombuchaKip> RandomReader: Interesting. I wouldn't have thought Intel would have spent time porting it to a rival platform.

[06:03:37] <RandomReader> it's annoyingly difficult to find info on this, they don't seem to have any real documentation
[06:04:41] <RandomReader> but I see hints that libstdc++ can be built with either a TBB backend, or a "serial" backend (which simply doesn't parallelize anything)

[06:06:40] <RandomReader> in general though, there seems to be so much going on that I'd still just reach for a memory profiling tool to narrow things down
[06:07:47] <KombuchaKip> RandomReader: I have a consumer thread pool, yes. But the std::function's provided to it, as work functions, could do anything, including using STL parallel execution policy which would probably create a thread pool, if not already, by the implementation.
[06:07:48] <RandomReader> without that kind of tool available, I'd start stubbing/commenting out operations until the problem disappears

[06:08:26] <RandomReader> but for what you're working on, you control this, right?
[06:10:10] <KombuchaKip> RandomReader: Yes and no. Yes, the user work functions I could change to use std::execution::seq, but that's not really desirable. But when using std::execution::par within a work function, I don't have any control over what TBB does behind the scenes in creating a thread pool, allocating a stack for each of a particular size, etc.
[06:11:28] <RandomReader> I mean I'm wondering why anything would use execution::par when you already have a thread pool
[06:11:42] <RandomReader> as in, these things are more likely to sabotage each other than run effectively
[06:11:56] <RandomReader> in terms of raw efficiency I mean, not in terms of bugs
[06:13:04] <RandomReader> anyway, beside the point in terms of trying to track down the memory issue, was just curious
[06:13:09] <KombuchaKip> Well each work function is a discrete logical task that needs to be performed. How it's actually performed is up to the work function, but when it's performed is up to the WorkQueueManager.

[09:30:23] <pflanze> I'm looking for recommendations on how to set up Emacs, for development with clang and g++
[09:30:37] <pflanze> (I'm on Debian)
[09:30:53] <ville> pflanze: to get emacs and its addons to work with c++ in reasonable manner firstly you want to setup your build system so it produces a compile_commands.json. probably into your project root
[09:31:35] <pflanze> OK, I guess I'll google that format (I'm using hand written Makefiles and scripts)
[09:32:45] <pflanze> Or maybe I should bite the bullet and learn cmake, I don't know.
[09:33:40] <ville> you can get plain make to spit it out as well with couple of rules. you can also use a tool such as bear
[09:34:00] <ville> https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear
[09:35:15] <pflanze> Thanks! That's in Debian as `bear`.
[09:36:43] <ville> this is my makefile "template" i copy around when i start a project: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/61ef91720667ff35 it does the compile_commands.json with plain make. no need for external tools
[09:38:12] <ville> you can call it like so: `make CXX=clang++ sanitizer` and it will build with clang++ passing in flags to enable sanitizer builds for example
[09:38:59] <ville> or `make debug` and it will use g++ to do a debug build

[09:39:48] <pflanze> OK, cool. I think I should look at that tomorrow or so, since it's very late and my head is hazy already; maybe it's best if you give me just some hints on what you use, then I'll try it and get back to you when needed.
[09:39:52] <pflanze> Makes sense?
[09:40:28] <ville> anyways with that out of the way you'll probably then want to look into: https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/ for "IDE"-like features
[09:40:38] <AmR> Can I build boost.xxxx.zip from cmake ?
[09:40:43] <ville> this needs the compile_commands.json
[09:41:00] <pflanze> ok
[09:41:59] <pflanze> Is lsp-mode the only thing you added? (on top of standard c++-mode I guess)
[09:42:13] <ville> no. getting to them...
[09:42:17] <pflanze> aha
[09:42:59] <ville> you will possibly also want to look into some package that let's you run your build commands. i use: https://github.com/ReanGD/emacs-multi-compile
[09:43:24] <pflanze> ok
[09:44:27] <ville> it's fairly flexible and easy to configure. for example i've set it up so that if it sees makefile in the project root, it shows me a menu for: make CXX=clang++ debug, make CXX=clang++ release, make CXX=clang++ sanitizer. and same for g++ builds
[09:45:18] *** Joins: aniketgm (~Aniket@49.36.109.33)
[09:45:20] <pflanze> ok
[09:45:26] <ville> those correspond to the makefile i showed earlier, but you can configure it to give you specific menus based on various criteria
[09:45:58] <ville> for example if it sees a CMakeList.txt it would know to show things related to that
[09:47:32] <ville> that should get you going i guess
[09:47:46] <pflanze> OK, cool, thanks! I'll try it asap.
[09:48:42] <ville> AmR: you can run sequences of shell commands from most any build system. boost has instructions how to build it on its website. so that means you can replicate that sequence in your build system

[17:49:19] <PJBoy> clangd, yeah
[17:49:31] <PJBoy> it's a C++ implementation of the Language Server Protocol
[17:49:37] <Haohmaru> i think i heard someone was making a plugin for it for C::B even
[17:49:42] <Haohmaru> but not sure what happened
[17:49:52] <ville> Haohmaru: at least for emacs it modularized, so clangd can be used to do the parsing part. but that it self has no visible interface in emacs. you can choose your own "representation thing"
[17:49:53] <PJBoy> which aims to be generic interface that IDEs can use to process C++
[17:50:08] <PJBoy> but IDEs have been doing a lousy job of using it so far

[17:56:18] <Haohmaru> don't tell me it's interpreted
[17:58:29] <LordKalma> PJBoy, I have a generic LSP client extension in mind
[17:58:36] <LordKalma> it's bottom of my project log though
[18:00:16] <ville> it may be intepreted as-is, but in general it's compiled into bytecode. and everyone is now waiting for emacs 28 which will be able to compile to native
[18:01:41] <Haohmaru> so there's gonna be a compiler from this "elisp" down to native, or did they just rewrite the emacs thing in something more normal like C?

[18:03:04] <Haohmaru> stay here PJBoy
[18:03:23] <ville> emacs' "core" or the interpreter and byte compiler are written in c i believe. the "editor" commands and such are then written in elisp. which can be intepreted, compiled to bytecode and in the future to native code
[18:04:04] <Haohmaru> is that basically its own dedicated "language" like mIRC's scripts?
[18:04:08] <ville> the native compilation uses libgccjit i believe

[18:04:50] <ville> it's a lisp-something language. derivative or whatever you wish to call it

[18:05:51] <ville> your basic dynamically typed, garbage collected, funtional language. basically hitting the trifecta of things that suck
[18:06:03] <rpav> i think maybe you'd want an `operator T&()` in `moving` so you could transparently initialize things that didn't implement a "T(const moving<T>&)`

[18:13:37] <sandal> hey folks! I am attempting to add a header and cpp source file to my project, on windows, msvc, c++17, and I am getting a bunch of errors like this: 'BOOL SetCurrentDirectoryW(LPCWSTR)': cannot convert argument 1 from 'const _Elem *' to 'LPCWSTR'... I am not very familiar with windows, but this code compiles just fine when it is compiled independently of my project
[18:14:19] <PJBoy> any context on that?
[18:14:38] <Haohmaru> are you missing some -DDEFINEs?
[18:14:39] <PJBoy> windows notably has a different definition of wchar_t than linux
[18:14:55] <Haohmaru> oh, it's not even gcc
[18:15:19] <sandal> I don't think I am missing an DEFINEs, I threw it in a blank cmake project and it compiled just fine
[18:15:54] <leduyquang753> What is `_Elem`?
[18:16:11] <rpav> UB? ;)
[18:17:18] <sandal> ahh sorry, below the error I originally gave, it gives me: cannot convert argument 2 from 'char *' to 'LPWSTR'
[18:17:49] <PJBoy> the error is sensible
[18:17:53] <sandal> not sure what _Elem is
[18:17:53] <leduyquang753> It is expecting a wide string rather than a normal string.
[18:18:00] <PJBoy> but one would wonder why you're calling that function
[18:18:29] <PJBoy> it could well be that your windows build is `#define UNICODE` or something
[18:18:31] <leduyquang753> So it is probable you were compiling your thing without Unicode on and now you do.
[18:18:37] *** Joins: kraa (~kraa@107-190-7-216.cpe.teksavvy.com)
[18:19:38] <sandal> the char * comes from calling .c_str() on a std::string
[18:19:53] <PJBoy> that makes sense too
[18:20:21] <sandal> oh so is there a way to tell the compiler to give me back a wide string instead of a char *
[18:20:40] <sandal> it looks like the windows API is using the right call (the unicode call instead of the ascii one)
[18:20:51] <sandal> but the std lib is giving me ascii stuff
[18:21:05] <leduyquang753> Use `std::wstring` or `MultiByteToWideChar`.
[18:21:29] <sandal> ah gotcha. I am using an external library (duckDB) and was hoping to avoid a code change :)

[18:38:39] <Haohmaru> ..and shrugs
[18:38:41] <PJBoy> like if you need to do something like `T var = static_cast<T>(expr);`, the writing of T there is pointless
[18:38:45] <rpav> though if you start using auto lambas, different story since it's basically a template

[20:06:16] <manuels> Is there a patter similar to the service locator pattern, but such that there is no a single serviceendpoint, but rather an extension pool where multiple extensions are stored which clients can get?

[20:13:13] <manuels> Imagine a keyboard launcher. Plugins can implement the querhandler interface and register itself. A query engine then fetches the handler from the pool. This could also be achieved by the service locator pattern if the engine provides a service endpoint and all handler register themselves there. But now imagine there is also an action provider
[20:13:13] <manuels> interface for e.g. Files. The files query handler itself is a plugin implementing the query handling interface. If it would offer a service endpoint only this plugin could use the registered action providers, but since other plugins could offer file items too, the extension pool allows more plugins to use the file action providers.

[20:13:50] <manuels> Is that a valid use case for this pattern or is this nonsense? And does this pattern exist?

[20:20:05] <manuels> In short does it make sense in a mutilpe producer multiple consumer topology to just have a global passive pool?
[20:20:13] <rpav> there aren't really limitations that aren't theoretical (you can't solve the halting problem) or purely syntactic (can't make the code you type precisely as brief as you'd like)

[20:51:59] <xkoncek> first problem i noticed with octrees was that if my object happens ot overlap with the boundaries, i cannot split the space further
[20:52:51] <xkoncek> a solution that seems to work is not to split the cube in 8 half-sized cubes but in 8 larger cubes that overlap in the middle
[20:53:16] <xkoncek> like 2/3 or 5/8 or so
