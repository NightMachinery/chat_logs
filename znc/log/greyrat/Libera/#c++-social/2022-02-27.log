[14:42:42] <Carbonflux> i notice that no one is wearing masks or social distancing in this war.
[14:43:41] <jotham> what
[14:43:56] <Carbonflux> i think everyone needs to mask up so they are not a danger to others.
[14:43:57] <jotham> there are heaps of videos of ukranians wearing masks while they get their rifles, make molotovs, etc
[14:44:34] <jotham> in places like bomb shelters it's all a bit theoretical though, right
[14:44:39] <jotham> cause there is hardly proper airflow
[14:44:56] <jotham> https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/26/15/54688923-0-image-a-36_1645890633668.jpg
[14:45:11] <jotham> normal ukrainians are like normal europeans in that they haven't turned masks into a weird parisan shitshow
[14:45:13] <jotham> like you americans
[14:45:17] <Carbonflux> all the street interviews i have seen there are no masks.
[14:45:22] <jotham> https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/ukraine-resistance-russia-war-molotov-1572341.jpg?r=1645944778115
[14:45:30] <jotham> i assure you mask wearing is widespread amongst civilian ukranians
[14:45:38] <ERROH> we have evidence that people who questioned covid response and were 'vacine sceptics' turned out to be putler apologists
[14:45:45] <jotham> https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=jpeg&quality=70&width=720&fit=pad&dpr=1&url=https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/blt35b4d5858da738b3/621b47f4a73a64496fd3d56d/COCKTAILS.png
[14:45:47] <ERROH> so i'll say this way Carbonflux 
[14:45:54] <ERROH> you are undermensh
[14:46:08] <Carbonflux> what about vaccination rates?
[14:46:19] <ERROH> you are a scum of this earth, and please do the needful and get the fuck out
[14:46:39] <ERROH> you're not 'smart', you're not 'observant'
[14:46:48] <jotham> the main thing that struck me actually was that people were wearing masks during a fucking invasion
[14:46:54] <Carbonflux> i just find it interesting how risk works in relation to context.
[14:47:01] <jotham> and Carbonflux is out here going he he he masks r dumb i'm an american partisan hack
[14:47:15] <jotham> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMieC2_VgAIKXVT?format=jpg&name=large
[14:47:31] <ERROH> he's either paid idiot or free for all idiot
[14:47:35] <jotham> (for the record my search terms were: ukranians make molotovs)
[14:47:40] <jotham> you can go do the search yourself Carbonflux 
[14:47:47] <ERROH> he can't
[14:47:58] <jotham> ukranians, like all non-brainwormed dickfuckers largely wear masks during a global pandemic
[14:48:12] <ERROH> animals can't do 'research'
[14:48:29] <ERROH> the way animals do 'research' makes them speak like deepak chorpa
[14:48:35] <jotham> if anything masks are a tacit signal of group cohesion and caring about others
[14:48:56] <jotham> https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26326483.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_UKRAINE-RUSSIA-CONFLICT.jpg
[14:49:07] <jotham> there are a lot of ukranian civvies wearing masks
[14:49:11] <jotham> during a war
[14:49:19] <Carbonflux> masks can also represent masks.
[14:49:31] <jotham> masks represent agreeing to look after each other
[14:49:35] <jotham> regardless of the science behind them
[14:49:40] <jotham> that's why you yanks can't figure them out
[14:49:50] <jotham> individualism has fucked your heads
[14:50:21] <Oxyd> He just doesn't have the mental capacity to recognise obvious propaganda lies as such.
[14:50:23] <Carbonflux> or they mean a muting or blocking of speech, or deception. 
[14:50:29] <ERROH> notice how you destroyed his train of innocent observant thought, but there's no "sorry i was wrong, i stand corrected"
[14:50:39] <ERROH> fucking putler rtoll he is
[14:51:59] <Carbonflux> masks are very symbolic, they always have been, they can mean many things. 
[14:52:17] <jotham> you're just taking the wrong symbol away
[14:52:22] <jotham> because you're a fringe dickfucking idiot
[14:52:33] <jotham> the symbol is cohesion and care for others
[14:53:09] <jotham> https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/02/25/kyiv-ukraine-250222-02.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/kyiv-ukraine-250222-02.jpg
[14:53:29] <Carbonflux> well, it seems like you missed my point totally.
[14:53:31] <jotham> you not seeing how many civvies in ukraine are wearing masks all the time is evidence of your weird blinded batshit crazy 
[14:53:40] <jotham> during a war
[14:53:44] <jotham> sure, move the goal posts mate
[14:53:48] <jotham> your american values can fuck off
[14:53:59] <Carbonflux> i was trying to compare risk tolerance in various frames of reference.
[14:54:06] <jotham> sure
[14:54:09] <ERROH> haha
[14:54:13] <jotham> but you also said this, Carbonflux 
[14:54:20] <jotham> 00:20:23 Carbonfl+| or they mean a muting or blocking of speech, or deception. 
[14:54:23] <jotham> you're fully cooked
[14:54:29] <jotham> and you are a bad actor during a crisis
[14:54:54] <jotham> i think the entire planet is sick of america's shit at this point
[14:54:55] <Carbonflux> that sounds like medical fascism jotham 
[14:55:12] <jotham> you guys need to be delinked from the internet until you can send a ship to explain why you are allowd back
[14:55:25] <jotham> why the fuck is steve bannon funding fucking mental health patients in NZ
[14:55:32] <Carbonflux> i don't have the right to speak or even think in the face of your orthodoxy and blackmail?
[14:55:35] <jotham> you guys are causing a lot of dipshit harm
[14:55:44] <jotham> you don't, that's correct
[14:55:51] <jotham> you've let the human race down
[14:56:36] <ERROH>  what's that about bannon again?
[14:56:54] <jotham> so we've had a protest for 20 days here at the parliament
[14:57:45] <ERROH> i'm afraid of where this is going
[14:57:59] <jotham> and they are all funded by unknown people, and the known people are counterspin media and voices for freedom, both groups are astrotuf groups, counterspin media is directly funded by bannon and his mates and they share content and use citizen journalism (livestreams on various platforms) to bypass journalism standards
[14:58:35] <jotham> and it results in people at nz protests 1- flying trump flags 2- flying the confederate flag 3- talking about first amendment
[14:58:43] <jotham> that's the obvious surface level stuff
[14:59:05] <jotham> Carbonflux's people literally causing harm to clearly mentally feeble new zealanders
[14:59:14] <Carbonflux> they are just trying to poison the well so that anyone that objects to these controls has no where to go.
[14:59:41] <jotham> your people are making our countrymen sick
[14:59:51] <jotham> and the masks are the least of it
[14:59:55] <jotham> but you appear to have that brain worm too
[15:00:22] <ERROH> given that trump is russia funded i still blame putler
[15:00:23] <Carbonflux> if you object to medical fascism you are automatically right wing or qanon or something. Its a trick.
[15:00:50] <ERROH> i've mostly ignored us in this intire thing, i just hope cia is actually giving ukr intel
[15:00:52] <Carbonflux> both sides are corrupt.
[15:01:10] <Carbonflux> both sides are fake.
[15:03:02] <Faux> "you are a bad actor during this crisis" quite nicely sums up my thoughts on Carbonflux across multiple different crisiseses.
[15:03:35] <Carbonflux> the US is giving Ukraine satellite data. 
[15:04:07] <ERROH> oh, so you're not actually ignoring me
[15:04:10] <Faux> I did wonder if the russia would start shooting down american satellites, surely that's definitely war.
[15:04:18] <ERROH> means i can freely continue to insult you <3
[15:04:29] <Carbonflux> why would i ignore you ERROH?
[15:04:40] <jotham> weird, my fiber went down, Carbonflux, did you astral project into my fiber tap
[15:04:51] <Carbonflux> you are good training for my Buddhist practice.
[15:05:12] <jotham> anyway moaning about masks seems like extreme virtue signalling
[15:05:24] <jotham> more than just wearing them in the off chance i don't kill my mother who is doing chemotherapy
[15:05:36] <jotham> it's very simple logic
[15:05:36] <Carbonflux> i just see the mask thing as an artist.
[15:05:44] <Carbonflux> its very interesting.
[15:06:03] <jotham> but i find it very strange the protests against vaccination in nz are absolutely laden with dipshit american ideas
[15:06:05] <Carbonflux> its not political for me.
[15:06:49] <Carbonflux> masking is an ancient thing with many different meanings.
[15:07:08] <Carbonflux> to repress the act of exploring that is not good.
[15:07:16] <jotham> you're definitely willfully ignorant
[15:07:23] <jotham> or just a public health menace
[15:07:46] <Faux> Being a public health menace, ignorant or not, probably makes you a bad actor, and probably political.
[15:08:11] <jotham> the amount of american horseshit pumped into our anti-vax movement here is ridiculous
[15:08:15] <Carbonflux> demanding people stop thinking about the symbolic nature of life in the face of a public health emergency is basically evil. 
[15:08:34] <jotham> yeah but you made all that up Carbonflux 
[15:08:39] <jotham> to protect your vanity
[15:08:46] <jotham> because you literally said what i posted above
[15:08:52] <jotham> some stupid memetic american horseshit
[15:08:58] <jotham> that maybe masks make you the bad guy
[15:09:02] <Carbonflux> those are your thoughts, not mine.
[15:09:08] <jotham> because you're a dipshit that cares about your freedom, not social cohesion
[15:09:17] <jotham> mate
[15:09:28] <jotham> you started this chat saying lel ukranians, no masks, lel risk, it's a war
[15:09:38] <jotham> yet everyone has seen ukranians wearing masks preparing for war
[15:09:41] <jotham> for over a week
[15:09:41] <Carbonflux> i wear a mask when required without objection
[15:09:47] <jotham> you're either willfully ignorant, or a dipshit
[15:09:50] <Carbonflux> but that does not stop me from thinking about it.
[15:09:50] <jotham> by your own admission
[15:10:13] <Carbonflux> where is the threat?
[15:10:32] <jotham> killing someone else because you infected or got infected?
[15:10:35] <jotham> seems bad?
[15:10:37] <jotham> that's the threat?
[15:10:41] <Carbonflux> i am fully vaccinated and wear masks as required by local regulation
[15:10:42] <jotham> you fucking piece of shit
[15:11:39] <Carbonflux> i free to think about and reflect on whatever i want to without being blackmailed by people who suggest thinking itself it a threat to public safety.
[15:11:48] <jotham> anyway mate, i realise things in your country are wildly different to everyone else
[15:11:53] <jotham> and i just can't relate to your freedom
[15:12:05] <jotham> but please don't say bullshit about ukraine and masks
[15:12:13] <jotham> when they literally wear them to make bombs and do civil insurgency
[15:12:13] <Carbonflux> its not about freedom, its about thinking.
[15:12:17] <jotham> and we've all spent a week seeing it
[15:12:19] <jotham> you're just a dumbarse
[15:12:32] <Carbonflux> you are not an artist, i forget that.
[15:13:16] <ERROH> with all due respect to autists, but don't you mean 'autist'?
[15:13:38] <Carbonflux> my undergrad degree is in fine art.
[15:14:14] <Carbonflux> maybe that training creates a different view of the world.
[15:14:22] <jotham> i mean i literally have a fine art degree
[15:14:29] <jotham> mostly graphic design and art history
[15:14:48] <jotham> but i also know that artist cunts are afraid of reason destroying the freedom of their imagination 
[15:14:52] <Carbonflux> then why don't you understand?
[15:14:54] <jotham> so maybe you're just a dumb old cunt clinging to that
[15:15:00] <Carbonflux> ah, your just trolling then.
[15:15:02] <jotham> because there is a public health crisis and a war
[15:15:12] <jotham> and unity is more important than being a unique snowflake
[15:15:22] <jotham> like all of you brainwormed yanks
[15:15:41] <Carbonflux> whatever.
[15:15:53] <jotham> you're a buddhist because you know you're incredibly self serving
[15:16:04] <jotham> that's why you couldn't see all the ukranians making bombs and collecting rifles wearing masks
[15:16:12] <jotham> and just said some dumb shit that came to mind about being an individual
[15:16:17] <jotham> and moved the goal posts ever since
[15:16:21] <Carbonflux> yes, Buddhism is very selfish.
[15:16:38] <jotham> it's reactionary for you
[15:16:44] <jotham> you're a selfish dipshit 
[15:17:07] <Carbonflux> no i am not.
[15:17:25] <Carbonflux> you don't get to define me.
[15:17:29] <jotham> 00:12:42 Carbonfl+| i notice that no one is wearing masks or social distancing in this war.
[15:17:31] <Carbonflux> define yourself.
[15:17:36] <jotham> selfish dipshit doesn't see actual reality
[15:17:42] <jotham> because 'medical fascism'

[15:22:00] <jotham> there have been even videos from a month ago of ukranian troops in donbas training wearing masks
[15:22:26] <jotham> normal people have been struck by how even during a war people are trying to stay covid safe
[15:22:30] <jotham> and you've just gone full american

[15:23:01] <Carbonflux> have you even had covid jotham?
[15:23:08] <jotham> even during a war, people don't agree with your position on masks
[15:23:16] <jotham> because they aren't all weird american retards
[15:23:18] <jotham> no Carbonflux 
[15:23:38] <jotham> i assume i will get it statistically by the 14th~
[15:24:02] <jotham> which means i can't go see mum and her boyfriend just died of cancer, and she has cancer
[15:24:25] <jotham> and if following a relatively painless protocol when i go to the supermarket, by wearing a proper mask, will result in me not giving her a plague
[15:24:27] <jotham> i will take that option
[15:24:34] <jotham> because i'm not a piece of shit
[15:25:10] <jotham> and it's not about the secret universal symbolism of masking
[15:25:15] <jotham> it's about not being an asshole to other people
[15:25:26] <jotham> for basically no cost to me
[15:25:32] <jotham> very unamerican, i know
[15:26:04] <Carbonflux> what it means is that your immune system is not educated.
[15:26:09] <jotham> jesus christ
[15:26:33] <jotham> Carbonflux: i assure you most new zealanders are currently freaking out about the fact we have ignorant immune systems due to our policy choices
[15:26:43] <jotham> Carbonflux: you don't need to fucking talk down from the podium of truth
[15:26:44] <Carbonflux> i have had covid three times and lived, that is after being vaccinated twice.
[15:26:48] <jotham> this is a well educated society
[15:27:23] <Carbonflux> being pure is weakness.
[15:27:29] <jotham> no ones being pure
[15:27:42] <Carbonflux> its anti-life.
[15:27:49] <jotham> if you talk to any antivaxxer, our vaccine rate means we're all ghosts walking and have bill gates controlling our dead bodies
[15:28:03] <jotham> you're just fitting a meme stereotype of a selfish dickhead
[15:28:08] <jotham> full of fan fiction about reality
[15:28:29] <Carbonflux> and you are not propagating memes as well? 
[15:28:40] <jotham> you should ask yourself why you didn't notice people wearing masks making molotovs all week
[15:28:49] <Carbonflux> you have no direct experience with any of this science.
[15:29:07] <jotham> right, there is always an appeal to authority in any lay argument
[15:29:11] <Carbonflux> you have no idea what is true or false, you only know what you are told.
[15:29:22] <jotham> i understand but you are moving the goal posts again
[15:29:29] <jotham> you literally didn't notice everyone in a war wearing masks

[15:36:16] <jotham> plus one of the good things about the human race is we get old and die and everyones kids fucking hate their parents ideas mostly
[15:36:16] <ERROH> and they've bought those citizenships with stolen money too
[15:36:46] <ERROH> you mean like that abrahamovitz daughter who instagrammed putin bad?
[15:37:11] <jotham> i haven't seen that, i was just meaning in general
[15:37:21] <jotham> also i just got an incident alert, 01:00 monday morning
[15:37:23] <jotham> son of a bitch
[15:37:37] <ERROH> well good thing you have conciousness girl, but you wouldn't be here if your father hasn't stolen from your poeple
[15:37:41] <Faux> *indecent
[15:37:51] <jotham> 1AM indecent 
[15:38:17] <ERROH> let's be honest
[15:38:19] <ERROH> dukwon https://i.redd.it/fgbkmpr1w7k81.png
[15:38:30] <ERROH> we all saw ham as protagonist here
[15:38:55] <ERROH> you already have a monday?  jesus
[15:39:51] <jotham> i am super over the anti mask anti vax brainworm shit, i'm not particularly pro it either
[15:40:00] <jotham> but being actively anti it seems like a big virtue signaling wank fest
[15:40:03] <jotham> for dumb shits
[15:41:11] <jotham> i think we'd all like to be in precedented (???) times, instead of unprecedented times
[15:41:26] <jotham> and imagineers are definitely not helping
[15:43:52] <ERROH> i honestly have no idea wtf his goal is, i have to assume he's bought out or such
[15:44:01] <ERROH> but maybe i'm too personal about the thing
[15:44:38] <jotham> i think it's a mix of an artists need to be imaginatively unbound and an american desire for freedom 
[15:44:43] <Renderwww> I just assume he's a californian hippie who did a bit too much drugs in his youth or something like that
[15:44:45] <jotham> freedom being a very loaded word
[15:45:14] <jotham> right now lots of those freedom yanks seem to be pretty in favor of putin
[15:45:17] <jotham> which is very ??? to me
[15:45:34] <Faux> The whole thing makes no sense to me and I refuse to try and understand.
[15:45:35] <jotham> sir, that is an authoritarian state you're salivating over
[15:45:40] <Faux> Hey everyone, don't blow people up, eh.
[15:46:08] <ERROH> i map their right to our extra large right with big fries and double milkshake
[15:46:29] <jotham> i think it might actually be as simple as this, if you can't do anything about a problem, don't you want to either delude yourself, or find a strong man who might be able to do something about it
[15:46:48] <jotham> so all the freedom folk have gone batshit or authoritarian
[15:46:50] <jotham> left and right
[15:47:20] <jotham> talking to mum on friday
[15:47:22] <jotham> she's so sick
[15:47:29] <jotham> and her bf just died
[15:47:39] <jotham> and there is this war, and there is nz finally getting the plague
[15:47:46] <jotham> and she is completely beaten to bits
[15:47:54] <jotham> and i realised i can't really program my way out of any of her problems
[15:48:00] <jotham> i'm absolutely useless
[15:48:08] <jotham> other than being there for her emotionally
[15:48:23] <ERROH> and those are currently thinking that 'pretend war' is happening becuase nwo covid plan failed and now gates wants to use putin to take control over everyone
[15:48:30] <Renderwww> is this a summary of the human condition?
[15:48:35] <jotham> so i can see why you might start making drastic choices about your life and beliefs in the fantasy that some other system will just fix it all and make you feel less constant anxiety
[15:48:37] <Faux> That's a good start, jotham.
[15:48:41] <ERROH> that's why putin looks so bad, he's not agreeing to that, but they force him
[15:49:19] <jotham> yeah that's why i think some massive delusion and authoritarian thing is happening, bigger than putin, but definitely he's part of this zietgeist
[15:49:26] <jotham> the brainworms are way strong
[15:50:17] <Renderwww> Gates is using Putin to forcibly vaxx all of ukrania to give them free 5G
[15:50:21] <Renderwww> now it all makes perfect sense
[15:51:04] <Faux> They got starlink.
[15:51:16] <Faux> Hope Putin decides to shoot down some starlink satellites, just to see what happens.
[15:51:31] <Renderwww> more space garbage
[15:51:48] <jotham> wonder what the logistics are of accidentallying a corporations satellites
[15:51:54] <jotham> do they just do a price andrew
[15:51:59] <jotham> and settle for a few hundred mill
[15:52:01] <ERROH> tough ham
[15:52:30] <Renderwww> I just figured out how germany can get dragged into it, just highlight how bad the particle filters in russian tanks are
[15:52:50] <ERROH> starlink is tricky
[15:53:18] <ERROH> we've had incidents where satellite phones were used as homing devices for rockets
[15:53:45] <Renderwww> yeah, if the russian military shot down a satellite I'm not sure if they would bother to compensate anyone fori t
[15:54:00] <Faux> Renderwww: And the infrasound they make.
[15:54:13] <jotham> i don't even know if there is any international territorial law around it
[15:54:29] <Renderwww> also they probably run over fields where some endangered field mouse population lives 
[15:56:05] <jotham> was funny reading about KL's underground motorways
[15:56:15] <jotham> they used a big af TBM to make it 2? lanes but 2 stories as well
[15:56:23] <jotham> and when it rains they turn the lower level into a flood channel
[15:56:27] <jotham> solving their monsoon dramas
[15:56:28] <Faux> Haha.
[15:56:30] <jotham> but
[15:56:37] <jotham> they had to build it really weirdly snakey 
[15:56:43] <jotham> because muslims believe you own the land all the way down
[15:56:48] <jotham> westerners not so much
[15:56:54] <jotham> so i wonder how that goes for space
[15:57:24] <Faux> The storm has made the dartford crossing, our major bridge/tunnel system after the eurotunnel, exciting; they have 4 road lanes in a tunnel and 4 road lanes on a bridge, and typically run northbound underground and southbound oversea, but when it's too windy for oversea they try and run everything underground.
[15:57:54] <Renderwww> tunnels 1, bridges 0
[15:57:56] <jotham> how did the UK hold up in the recent weather events
[15:58:06] <jotham> i was side tracked
[15:58:13] <jotham> usually perv up uk news fairly heavily for fun
[15:58:35] <Faux> We had cars smashed by trees and roof tiles off; there was a random bit of slate embedded in our edging like a throwing knife, but I don't think we had any deaths.
[15:58:43] <Faux> Lots of fences down.
[15:59:12] <Faux> https://goo.gl/maps/H78cdFTi1MzXf9nT9 I assume that tiny road is where they do the lane switcheroo.
[15:59:32] <Faux> Haha, the 3d is so good on the bridge.
[16:00:08] <yano> https://colors.lol/
[16:01:53] <jotham> son of a bitch, i need to figure out a battery alert
[16:02:01] <jotham> loaded fauxes page and rotated it in 3D
[16:02:13] <jotham> laptop was like, yep, that's your battery done
[16:02:18] <Faux> <3
[16:02:24] <jotham> what do you guys use for battery alerts
[16:02:26] <Faux> Going from consuming 3W to 300W as the GPU spins up.
[16:02:33] <jotham> yeah exactly
[16:02:37] <jotham> i just had terminal open
[16:02:40] <Faux> I have the life in my status bar, and it goes red as it goes under 15m.
[16:03:01] <jotham> i probably need to get it to make some boinking noises as it gets down to 10%
[16:03:13] <jotham> big battery boink
[16:03:42] <Faux> Don't use my laptop untethered on battery for work much, only for irc, so it's infrequently a problem. Mostly because the battery is useless; something like 20 minutes with the CPU pegged (i.e. intellij running).
[16:04:17] <jotham> yeah this is my t495s, basically a mobile phone
[16:04:21] <jotham> unless it tries to use its gpu
[16:04:25] <jotham> so it can last for fucking hours
[16:04:33] <jotham> or precisely seconds

[17:53:47] <Zogatribe> if we are going to have WW3 then I need to panic buy alcohol and toilet rolls.
[17:54:13] <jotham> give you some advice
[17:54:27] <jotham> mostly focus on tinned tomatoes, dried beans, and frozen meat
[17:54:30] <jotham> and medical stuff
[17:54:50] <jotham> dried legumes are your best long term bang for your buck
[17:55:02] <jotham> and they all need tomatoes to be edible
[17:55:11] <jotham> tinned tomatoes can last for years
[17:55:16] <jotham> same with dried beans
[17:55:44] <Zogatribe> the problem with dried food is you need water to cook it
[17:55:48] <jotham> meat can last 2-3 years frozen, but maybe the power goes out
[17:55:54] <jotham> dried beans and tinned tomatoes
[17:56:04] <jotham> you're from the UK
[17:56:07] <jotham> you have canals
[17:56:11] <jotham> you can make a fire and boil water
[17:56:28] <jotham> your country doesn't even have a decent hill
[17:56:34] <jotham> people up high struggle with water
[17:56:50] <Zogatribe> not sure there is any point trying to survive the nuclear apocolypse: which is why I need to panic buy alcohol instead
[17:57:05] <jotham> that isn't what is going to happen
[17:57:17] <jotham> all that is going to happen is fuel will fuck out and supply chains will collapse
[17:57:21] <jotham> and power iwll be dodgy
[17:57:45] <jotham> might be worth buying some alibaba solar shit
[17:57:45] <Zogatribe> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrHoMSRZOS4
[17:57:53] <jotham> i can't watch that video sorry
[17:57:55] <Zogatribe> ^^ that is what will happen
[17:57:55] <jotham> tl;dr it
[17:58:21] <jotham> okay curl says it's from threads
[17:58:24] <jotham> threads is a good movie
[17:58:27] <jotham> but it isn't going to happen
[17:58:57] <jotham> fuel is going to cost a million and make your life uncomfortable
[17:59:11] <jotham> since fuel affects every single product you consume
[17:59:26] <jotham> plastic, utility, food, utility supply
[17:59:47] <jotham> you're gonna die in a slow dumb way not in a far fetched way
[17:59:58] <jotham> we're on the dumbest timeline
[18:00:20] <jotham> plus don't you brits all love tinned beef
[18:00:25] <jotham> so you have that going for you
[18:00:44] <jotham> i tried to buy some MRE's from the NZ army
[18:00:48] <jotham> but they are very expensive
[18:01:04] <jotham> i think dried food + canned food is the cheapest long term prepper choice
[18:01:47] <jotham> and frozen meat is a total luxury while the powergrid works
[18:01:57] <jotham> still worth getting when it's cheap
[18:03:42] <MaNI> most likely it will be the armed thugs that will get you, when they come to take your stocks of tinned food and solar panels
[18:04:12] <jotham> yep
[18:04:22] <jotham> solar tuna and tinned windmills
[18:05:15] <jotham> Zogatribe: yeah definitely get yourself a few https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Luty#Firearms_design
[18:05:20] <jotham> Zogatribe: it'd be nationalistic too
[18:05:30] <jotham> you definitely will have to protect your tinned tomatoes
[18:07:05] <MaNI> rice keeps quite well
[18:07:34] <MaNI> a couple sacks of rice to mix with whatever cockroaches you manage to catch and you're sorted 
[18:10:16] <jotham> yeah when the plague started i got super into prepper shit with food
[18:10:22] <jotham> but not in the weird crazy way
[18:10:37] <jotham> i have a lot of brown rice vacuum sealed and heaps and heaps of dried legumes of different types
[18:10:41] <jotham> and a lot of tinned tomatoes
[18:10:48] <jotham> i know it sounds dumb about the tomatoes
[18:10:54] <jotham> but they really do make any dish pretty edible
[18:11:01] <jotham> and you jsut need dried spice and a fire
[18:11:19] <jotham> now omicron is decimating nz i'm basically living off the stash
[18:11:47] <jotham> wish i could keep chickens, but that's another whole drama
[18:12:04] <jotham> i can grow a lot of stuff myself, well not here now, but my last place, and hopefully my next place
[18:12:12] <jotham> i have nz non monsanto seeds for most things
[18:12:19] <jotham> so they can survive a cycle without dying
[18:12:48] <jotham> also it makes me lol you need like 12-16 chickens if you want to eat a hen every 3-4 weeks
[18:12:50] <Zogatribe> things are getting as bad as Cuban Missile Crisis IMO
[18:13:00] <jotham> we totally are spoiled for meat with our mechanized society
[18:13:10] <jotham> they absolutely are not Zogatribe 
[18:13:14] <jotham> you're hysterical
[18:13:28] <jotham> there is no reason for russia to nuke its own vassal states
[18:16:31] <Zogatribe> there's the rub tho, we are not talking about russia, we are talking about Putin and Putin appears to be batshit crazy at this point
[18:16:58] <Zogatribe> we need a coup in the coming hours
[18:18:32] <jotham> he isn't
[18:18:34] <jotham> he's very rational
[18:18:42] <jotham> but like my doc said, when i tried to kill myself
[18:18:51] <jotham> the problem with suicide is it's rational to everyone doing it
[18:19:03] <jotham> putin isn't 'some batshit crazy guy'
[18:19:08] <jotham> he's just got his narrative nailed down
[18:19:11] <jotham> in a way we can't relate to
[18:19:54] <jotham> i reject the idea that putin is just mental, he's rational and it's against your living norms
[18:20:11] <jotham> that's why i don't think nuclear war is likely
[18:20:23] <jotham> i think extorting concessions out of nato is the obvious thing he wants
[18:20:45] <jotham> and europe will capitulate
[18:21:07] <jotham> the slow creep of authoritarianism is a lot more real than someone trying to commit geopolitical suicide
[18:21:20] <jotham> 1 million syrians already proved that in europe
[18:21:39] <jotham> europeans lost their shit over some basically well educated migrants, that they mostly needed for their power paying jobs
[18:21:44] <jotham> and it turned half of europe fash
[18:21:55] <jotham> so 4 million ukranians will cook europe completely
[18:22:09] <jotham> but nuclear war is a dumb concern
[18:22:25] <jotham> putin would rather conquer you by being clever than glass you
[18:22:40] <jotham> also the uk isn't even the front line
[18:22:56] <jotham> and all the russian money is in london
[18:23:00] <jotham> so totally unlikely
[18:23:30] <jotham> Zogatribe: best bit of threads for me was
[18:23:58] <jotham> Zogatribe: i have seen so many movies where women magically have babies in a crisis, and i'm like, what about the umbilical, what about the amiotic sack
[18:24:08] <jotham> Zogatribe: that movie has a girl chewing the umbilical
[18:24:32] <MaNI> nuking a country next door to you seems incredibly reckless
[18:24:52] <Oxyd> Who says he's going to nuke Ukraine?
[18:24:54] <jotham> doesn't fit with the idea of expanding your empire either
[18:25:05] <jotham> Zogatribe is moaning about it Oxyd 
[18:25:13] <MaNI> if hes going to nuke someone it would be the US
[18:25:15] <jotham> seems fatalistic wanks of a brit
[18:25:20] <MaNI> but thats okay nobody will miss them ;) 
[18:25:36] <jotham> that's why he referenced threads
[18:25:48] <jotham> but a few brits and americans i know are all upset about being nuked
[18:26:01] <jotham> i think it's their vanity
[18:26:34] <MaNI> like I found the whole "russians are taking over chernobyl so chernobyl is going to repeat itself" thing incredibly strange
[18:26:37] <jotham> if 'nukes' meant dissolve all the queers and jews, maybe they'd have an argument
[18:27:13] <MaNI> media love a good nuclear story though
[18:27:18] <jotham> MaNI: putin even spoke about the red line being ukraine restarting their nuclear program, after the agreement to dissarm
[18:27:31] <jotham> MaNI: so chernobyl seems symbolic of that breach
[18:27:34] <Oxyd> Presumably compromising the sarcophagus would be an issue.
[18:27:41] <jotham> absolutely
[18:27:55] <MaNI> it would yes, but theres no real sensible reason for them to do so
[18:28:08] <MaNI> and if they were to do so sending in ground troops would be the most illogical way to do it anyway
[18:28:11] <Oxyd> There's no real sensible reason for them to shoot at hospitals either.
[18:28:46] <MaNI> one of those things they can get away with mostly while still pushing their narrative and not compromising their invasion
[18:29:00] <jotham> i think messing with ukraines ability to get mutually assured destruction credentials is logoical for russia
[18:29:08] <MaNI> the other just creates a mess and totally destroys any "we were doing this because the west pushed us into it" narrative
[18:29:10] <jotham> but it doesn't lead to the uk or usa being glassed
[18:29:15] <jotham> like Zogatribe is worried about
[18:29:15] <Oxyd> Probably the most likely thing that could happen in Chernobyl is a stray artillery shell landing in just the wrong spot.
[18:29:17] <MaNI> so does nothing but harm their own agenda
[18:29:22] <MaNI> so would be pretty foolish
[18:29:45] <Oxyd> You keep assuming they'd do it on purpose.
[18:29:52] <jotham> putin has a point though
[18:29:56] <MaNI> well thats what the media narrative was saying
[18:30:07] <MaNI> I'm not assuming anything, I'm just analysing how ridiculous that narrative is
[18:30:36] <MaNI> yes theres completely a chance that it could happen accidentally (though rather unlikely)
[18:30:50] <jotham> did you read catch 22 MaNI 
[18:30:55] <jotham> i hated the book but i got the idea
[18:31:00] <jotham> i read it twice i hated it so much
[18:31:19] <jotham> i've worked in enough large organizations to know self interest creates stupid dangerous situations
[18:31:32] <jotham> like it's a true book about wars but it applies to business
[18:31:45] <MaNI> think I read it once upon a time, don't really remember
[18:31:47] <jotham> so even if russia wants to secure chernobyl it will still have situations where it runs out of gas
[18:31:55] <jotham> or accidentallies the shell surrounding the plant
[18:32:30] <MaNI> yeah sure its a risk, the idea of people fighting by chernobyl is not great
[18:32:45] <jotham> the basic idea of catch 22 is that war is driven by self interest in the guise of patriotism and that if you are sane and say you are insane, and say you think you're insane, you must be sane, or your valuation of being insane is unaccountable
[18:32:52] <MaNI> but there was specifically (for a time) a media narrative that made it sound like the russians wanted it to delibritely use it as a weapon or something
[18:33:06] <MaNI> which was odd, well not that odd, typical media, but still it lacked any logic or common sense
[18:33:16] <jotham> yeah that sounds dumb
[18:33:21] <jotham> i read something funny last week
[18:33:36] <jotham> saying how all news orgs are largely driven by people 'up with culture' so in their 20s and maybe their early 30s
[18:33:45] <jotham> so we've been lead by people making choices that are just kids
[18:33:57] <jotham> because they are attractive and are with the zeitgeist of the thing
[18:34:16] <jotham> children drive the media landscape, i think was the point
[18:34:24] <jotham> and they select the experts
[18:34:53] <jotham> i went out for dinner with 2 vets today
[18:35:11] <jotham> they were complaining about the US system, because failed US vets come to NZ and fail here again
[18:35:39] <jotham> and they said the US system has an extra credit system where you can do other $stuff unrelated to your degree or whatever to get points to push your score up from a B to an A
[18:35:52] <MaNI> well the whole greta thunberg thing makes that kind of believable
[18:36:19] <jotham> so we have this influx of americans getting vet degrees here (i live in a massive agg. city right now, it's all vets all the time, and all biologists and chemists making weird farming stuff)
[18:36:29] <jotham> and they are used to just getting a pass in america
[18:36:43] <jotham> made me realise half these doctors or whatever you see on the talking heads of tv
[18:36:52] <jotham> have probably got there through nepotism and tricks
[18:36:56] <jotham> not actually experts
[18:38:07] <jotham> anyway i was just saying that media narrative was driven by 20 year olds working in 'the media' that couldn't select an expert if they tried
[18:38:21] <jotham> and the university system means people with doctorates are iffy too
[18:38:26] <jotham> cause of the commercialisation of it
[18:38:35] <jotham> maybe if you had a peer reviewed expert that would help
[18:38:45] <jotham> media talking heads seem very bad
[18:39:38] <jotham> imagine how skeptical we would be if we saw a programming expert on tv
[18:39:41] <jotham> hehe
[18:39:46] <Oxyd> https://www.reddit.com/r/volunteersForUkraine/comments/t2j7p6/be_aware_there_are_scammers_here_who_fake_meet/ – sir, please deposit 1 ETH to my wallet so I can help you cross.
[18:41:30] <MaNI> yes it seems the media selects experts based on whether they self proclaim as such
[18:41:48] <jotham> Oxyd: don't you think at our current position in the internet, that everyone should be basically aware that everything online is a scam
[18:41:54] <jotham> i get why old people or kids get ripped off
[18:42:04] <jotham> but normal people should have some basic social skills around being scammed
[18:42:35] <Faux> I worry, 'cos I have to deal with idiots like lawyers and furniture shops, who are incapable of sending a non-scam-flavoured email.
[18:42:47] <jotham> maybe we need a new set of nursery rhymes and superstition that helps normies develop (i hate the term) common sense
[18:43:04] <jotham> i get phished quite aggressively cause of my job
[18:43:16] <jotham> and some of my customers get phished to leak me to them which i find even weirder
[18:43:27] <jotham> i know it's a numbers game, eventually i'll fuck up
[18:43:33] <jotham> or a customer will
[18:43:49] <Faux> I don't check my work email which helps.
[18:44:06] <Faux> How many Android exploits am I away from losing my current account?
[18:44:11] <jotham> i always think they will call to follow up an email if they meant to send it
[18:44:29] <Faux> Reminder email for this box, with a URL in it whicch is going to ask for my credit card details without me having logged in.
[18:44:33] <jotham> but in a week i definitely get 1-2 hand crafted phishing emails and 1-5 calls
[18:44:36] <Faux> Luckily credit cards aren't really subject to fraud anymore.
[18:44:56] <jotham> trust is the main thing right, but that's gonna break with voice synths
[18:44:56] <Faux> (to pay for the hosting for this machine I am using to talk with you from)
[18:45:12] <jotham> i trust the voice of certain people to ensure authority on a thing
[18:45:17] <jotham> no voice key material happens
[18:45:40] <Faux> I don't think I'd do anything over phone unless it was my parents, and simulating my parents' behaviour would be hard.
[18:46:01] <jotham> even with hundreds of hours of you crying to them about factorio
[18:46:04] <Faux> < me> OH MY GOD IT'S ALEXI'S BIRTHDAY??? < my mum> OH MY GOD YES SHE'S SUCH A GOOD DOG, I GOT HER A WHOLE FUCKING CHICKEN.
[18:46:14] <jotham> haha
[18:46:38] <jotham> russians hacked my daughter and she liked it
[18:46:48] <MaNI> when the guy who sounds like your lawyer starts asking for money in amazon vouchers that should be the giveaway
[18:46:56] <jotham> haha MaNI 
[18:47:06] <jotham> i've listendd to heaps of talks by social engineers
[18:47:10] <jotham> from defcon and stuff
[18:47:12] <Faux> Still cracks me up that mastercard/visa second factor goes through https://securesuite.co.uk, which is clearly a scam domain. Yes, it 500s on / from here.
[18:47:15] <jotham> and i am convinced i can be conned
[18:47:17] <jotham> i am made of meat
[18:47:22] <jotham> but i am a skeptical person
[18:47:37] <jotham> haha Faux 
[18:47:40] <Faux> I'm also one idiot coworker committing a rogue npm package away from losing my desktop.
[18:47:51] <Faux> Which worries me more, I think.
[18:48:09] <jotham> being the man version of av is pretty wank
[18:48:14] <jotham> most people hit snooze on me
[18:48:16] <MaNI> should isolate your nodeboy dev work in a VM
[18:48:32] <Faux> It's just too inconvenient; no tooling support.
[18:48:38] <jotham> this last week we blocked all russia and ukraine from our network
[18:48:42] <jotham> at the firewall evel
[18:48:43] <Faux> I'd probably be better running Chrome in a different user account, maybe?
[18:48:49] <jotham> even though we have like 20 ukrainian devs
[18:48:54] <jotham> was a CTO choice
[18:48:58] <Faux> :D
[18:49:25] <jotham> i said in the meeting multiple times
[18:49:35] <jotham> everyone uses vpns and the official gateways we've supplied
[18:49:37] <jotham> this is vanity
[18:49:41] <jotham> but i got smashed down
[18:49:56] <jotham> i think it's probably for insurance
[18:50:07] <jotham> yes sir, we blocked the sneaky orthodox christian nazis
[18:50:17] <jotham> can we get our cheque for being hacked
[18:51:27] <jotham> the real answer is trust sshd and iptables and revoke key material
[18:51:30] <Oxyd> https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ae4ece – oh, cool, there's an Osprey over Poland now. Why do Poles get to see all the cool military hardware and we don't?
[18:51:34] <jotham> but no one fucking ever knows what key material is
[18:51:55] <jotham> i'd love to see an osprey
[18:52:06] <jotham> maybe erroh is out screaming at it
[18:52:32] <jotham> wonder if one has ever visited nz, i doubt it
[18:53:40] <jotham> so what do you guys think the reason is, that all large news orgs, and all of social media, only has a tiny set of a few videos, the same videos, for everyone, from ukraine about the war
[18:53:47] <jotham> it can't just be perfect opsec
[18:53:55] <jotham> we're in a highly internet age
[18:54:12] <Faux> People not sharing 'cos they're worried about opsec?
[18:54:18] <Faux> Like, being shot by the russians as a spy.
[18:54:24] <Faux> Internet more down than advertised?
[18:54:26] <jotham> right opsec is my like 'smartest timeline' answer
[18:54:31] <jotham> but i know we're on the dumbest timeline
[18:54:34] <jotham> so it doesn't check out
[18:54:59] <jotham> also wouldn't it serve ukraine to show phosphor burned babies in hospitals screaming and crying
[18:55:13] <jotham> or the russians showing strong patriots being smoked by rockets
[18:55:18] <jotham> none of that is happening
[18:55:43] <Faux> Russia isn't doing a war and isn't killing people so can't do that.
[18:55:52] <Faux> Ukraine already has everyone's support so can save that stuff for later.
[18:55:52] <jotham> bandwidth wise upstream reports the internet fucked out yesterday for about 2 hours
[18:55:55] <jotham> but is mostly back
[18:56:17] <jotham> it's a weird cup of cold sick
[18:56:28] <jotham> i like the idea ukraine is basically russia
[18:56:34] <jotham> so it's psyops vs psyops
[18:57:26] <jotham> what do the rest of you guys think
[18:59:18] <jotham> today i went to the fruit store and there was a column of 6 drunk girls, 2 to an electric scooter, it's their first year at university, and like they were all filming it
[18:59:24] <jotham> i assume that's just normal society now
[19:00:36] <Faux> The university students that I talk to are all fucking weird, two years of failing to actually socialise is not good for a group of people who's primary job is to socialise.
[19:00:43] <Faux> Both types of socialise.
[19:00:53] <jotham> my street is glassed completely
[19:00:56] <jotham> it's all first years
[19:01:00] <jotham> so like what 18?
[19:01:03] <jotham> i mean good eye candy
[19:01:08] <jotham> total public disarray
[19:01:21] <jotham> street isn't safe to drive on
[19:01:30] <jotham> burned couches and matresses everywhere
[19:01:33] <jotham> tons of smashed bottles
[19:02:11] <jotham> we've had 2 years of basic normal life
[19:02:21] <jotham> and now the plague has hit everyones gone, fuck it, we're medicated as fuck
[19:02:24] <jotham> let her rip
[19:02:28] <jotham> so everyones just given up
[19:02:31] <Faux> Yup.
[19:02:35] <jotham> hence our r number is the highest in the world
[19:02:43] <jotham> haha
[19:02:48] <Faux> We're removing free tests at the end of the month.
[19:03:29] <jotham> gonna be like chlamydia but you can breath it onto your nan
[19:04:04] <jotham> today when greg picked me up
[19:04:15] <jotham> he started driving and i yelled at him
[19:04:20] <jotham> look at all the smashed shit
[19:04:27] <jotham> you have to just reverse the route you came
[19:04:34] <jotham> driving backwards is hard for new drivers
[19:04:36] <Faux> Perfectly, no mistakes.
[19:04:43] <jotham> even with a backing cam
[19:04:54] <jotham> and he had a stressful 200 meters
[19:05:13] <jotham> backing cams are still novelty to me
[19:05:26] <jotham> i like going into a parking building and driving backwards fast using the cam
[19:05:28] <Faux> It's the future, m8.
[19:05:30] <jotham> it's like a little video game
[19:05:49] <Faux> Keep seeing cars with actual engines in around here, pulling trailers.
[19:06:04] <Faux> Friends have just bought a small caravan so have to use their parents' skoda oldsmobile to move it, pretty comedic.
[19:06:08] <jotham> wish i'd seen what hte uk road network was like
[19:06:12] <jotham> i just used trains there
[19:06:17] <jotham> and busses in london
[19:06:37] <Faux> I'm not used to seeing cars with engines that aren't hairdresser sports cars.
[19:06:43] <jotham> hey serious question
[19:06:55] <Faux> The idea that you could actually use your car to move something bigger than a wooden rocking horse is weird to me.
[19:07:01] <jotham> how do you get one of those little garden plots, and what's the legal / historical basis of them in the uk
[19:07:05] <jotham> can a poor family get on
[19:07:12] <jotham> is it part of some idea of the commons
[19:07:20] <Faux> Allotments?
[19:07:24] <jotham> seems disconnected from your actual rental/ownership address
[19:07:26] <Faux> Near my old house they're balloted from the council I think.
[19:07:27] <jotham> yeah
[19:07:31] <jotham> we don't have that here
[19:07:33] <jotham> i like the idea
[19:07:41] <jotham> right now i'd love an allotment
[19:07:48] <jotham> cause i can't grow stuff at home
[19:08:07] <jotham> do you have to own land
[19:08:07] <Faux> http://www.ggaa.org.uk/ggaa1info.html waiting list, and rental, apparently.
[19:08:12] <Faux> I thought it was cheaper than that.
[19:08:12] <jotham> or is it seperate owned land
[19:08:26] <Faux> It says you don't have to be a resident.
[19:08:49] <jotham> wonder what the history of it is
[19:09:07] <jotham> right now i'd kill for a patch of shared garden
[19:09:44] <jotham> even simple things like, if i put garlic down now, in 6 months it'd be worth a fucking lot of money
[19:09:47] <Faux> http://www.ggaa.org.uk/m2handbookmarch2016.pdf page 4 has a "short history" going back to at least 1915, which I'm not reading.
[19:09:49] <jotham> like a few grand
[19:11:17] <jotham> okay the impetus was the two wars
[19:11:38] <Faux> Wikipedia claims you can't sell the produce.
[19:11:48] <Faux> There's a produce swap in one of the villages here.
[19:11:57] <jotham> oh man
[19:11:59] <Faux> The level up from going to the farmers' market in whiteness.
[19:12:13] <jotham> in like 1998-2002 we had a huge thing with that
[19:12:21] <jotham> and it broke mum and her boyfriends market garden
[19:12:55] <jotham> cause how does the government of a single payer heathcare system regulate farmers producing market produce on possibly lead tainted land
[19:13:02] <jotham> who has to pay for that, was their argument
[19:13:12] <jotham> so they banned the idea of people selling food
[19:13:52] <jotham> i hate knowing that the government is logical and it's against freedom
[19:13:55] <Faux> We live in a society.
[19:14:18] <jotham> anyway i guess the take away from this
[19:14:27] <jotham> i've been to the council like 4 times since i moved here
[19:14:31] <Faux> Can you tow on a mild hybrid or do they burst into flames?
[19:14:32] <jotham> i am that annoying guy
[19:14:42] <jotham> maybe i go ask the two ladies about getting a market garden plot
[19:14:52] <jotham> bet we have some uk hangover
[19:15:14] <jotham> even if i have to pay a little rent on it
[19:15:18] <jotham> i can grow stuff pretty well
[19:15:21] <jotham> and i am missing out
[19:16:10] <jotham> Faux: i have read towing hybrids is a massive debacle but have never tried it
[19:16:24] <Faux> I mean, I want to put a trailer behind it.
[19:16:28] <jotham> seems like it's up to the transmission system to me?
[19:16:32] *** Quits: chris64 (~chris@user/chris64) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:16:53] <jotham> oh you mean tow with a hybrid
[19:17:01] <jotham> towing ev's is a disaster for towies
[19:17:16] <jotham> but i don't see why you can't tow something if you have a hybrid or ev
[19:17:23] <jotham> they have massive torque in electric mode
[19:17:54] <jotham> probably your range is like fucked to bits
[19:18:12] <jotham> i'd say take your trailer weight / car weight and go from there
[19:18:24] <Faux> That's not a problem for a mild hybrid, at least. Hybrid is probably better suited for towing 'cos it's already used to moving a heavy fucker.
[19:18:26] <jotham> your range is definitely based on the friction of your car right
[19:18:37] <Faux> Can't be based on much else.
[19:18:39] <jotham> yeah
[19:18:55] <Faux> Some of it will be based on the cost of changing inertia, which will be pure mass, not friction.
[19:18:57] <jotham> seems like a non drama other than the car will absolutely lie to you about its range
[19:19:20] <jotham> what kind of motors are electrical engines anyway
[19:19:26] <jotham> just the standard brush motor?
[19:19:32] <Faux> Nah, they'll be computer.
[19:19:33] <jotham> or is it all science shit now
[19:19:37] <Faux> Computer Motors.
[19:19:45] <jotham> how does that work
[19:19:54] <jotham> induction at certian timing points?
[19:20:01] <Faux> Big transistors do the timing, yeah.
[19:20:22] <Faux> Measure where the rotor is and turn the magnets on just ahead of where it is.
[19:20:27] *** Quits: ymwm (~yingmanwu@117.26.69.52) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[19:20:33] <Faux> Repeat every few tens of micros and you get a motor.
[19:20:36] <jotham> i would guess the risk is just from the computer lying because it doesn't know how heavy you really are with a payload
[19:20:53] <Faux> It's.. uh.. closed loop? So it doesn't matter.
[19:21:12] <jotham> wait
[19:21:14] <Faux> Also the computer will already be doing current limiting 'cos the only thing that causes those motors to explode is overcurrent.
[19:21:16] <jotham> wait
[19:21:29] <jotham> you think the battery feedback is that reliable?
[19:21:38] <jotham> instead of an estimation?
[19:21:45] <Faux> I didn't mention batteries.
[19:21:50] <Faux> Oh!
[19:21:53] <jotham> oh sorry you said hybrid
[19:21:56] <Faux> I thought you meant the motor computer, not the battery computer.
[19:22:03] <jotham> i was thinking battery driving the car
[19:22:11] <jotham> and how fast it draws down
[19:22:20] <jotham> laptops seem bad at knowing the life of the battery?
[19:22:23] <jotham> even new ones
[19:22:41] <Faux> I would have thought that the hybrids actually had a reasonably good idea of how much power was left in the battery, as a percentage. Converting that into distance or runtime is the challenge.
[19:22:48] <jotham> i assume car bateries would base their logic on the natural weight of the car
[19:23:14] <Faux> For range they'll be doing a moving average over the last ten minutes, or something like that; that's what my petrol car does for range estimation.
[19:23:18] <jotham> guess that makes no sense when you deal with elevation changes
[19:23:35] <Faux> You drive through town and get on theh motorway and it tells you you're going to run out, and the range just goes up for the first ten minutes you drive on the motorway.
[19:23:41] <jotham> i don't really get how batteries work out their remaining charge tbh
[19:23:49] <Faux> Voltage curves!
[19:24:09] <Faux> https://www.batterypowertips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Battery-voltage-capacity-and-temp.png
[19:24:17] <Faux> Measure the voltage, know how much capacity is left.
[19:24:41] <Faux> Where "measure the voltage" is literally just an ADC.
[19:26:46] <jotham> you read about battery dendrites changing the ability of the battery to charge/discharge until it kills the battery
[19:26:47] <Faux> "how do adcs work" he wonders, oh look, it's opamps.
[19:26:52] <jotham> and it totally does my head in
[19:27:57] <jotham> okay so the voltage is an indicator based on some analysis of the health of the given battery unit
[19:28:06] <jotham> it seems all a bit woo-woo to me
[19:28:25] <jotham> maybe that's all electricity ever anyway
[19:28:35] <Faux> Voltage is pretty reliable. The main problem is that the curve is very flat at some points.
[19:28:46] <Faux> Very good when it's nearly full, not very good when it's about to die.
[19:29:00] <jotham> yeah okay
[19:29:27] <MaNI> doesn't matter because you're never meant to discharge batteries to the point where the curve gets crap anyway
[19:29:39] <MaNI> you want to treat it as flat when it still has 20% left or whatever
[19:29:41] <Faux> Advantage that cars have is that they have monitoring of probably 50 or 500 cells, whereas a laptop probably has monitoring of one battery, or maybe three cells.
[19:29:58] <jotham> voltage is basically the available electrons right, regardless of whatever with current is going on
[19:30:08] <jotham> so if the voltage gets sloppy there are less free electons
[19:30:13] <jotham> electrons*
[19:30:19] <Faux> Don't even start.
[19:30:22] <jotham> haha
[19:30:26] <jotham> rabbit. hole.
[19:30:50] <Faux> Regardless of how that discussion comes out, no, because you can't reliably measure the voltage of a cell unless it's discharging at some known, non-trivial rate.
[19:31:01] <jotham> right
[19:31:02] <jotham> haha
[19:31:46] <jotham> it's like one of those pick-a-path books
[19:31:53] <jotham> 1. rationalise about voltage
[19:31:58] <jotham> 2. rationalise about current
[19:32:04] <jotham> 3. tell the DM to fuck off
[19:33:56] <jotham> i will never know how we can tell a battery is almost flat
[19:34:14] <jotham> computer software all seems to depend on calibration against hte battery and its age
