[05:03:24] <MootPoot> I can tell you NONE of the online material even came close to covering what was actually in the quid
[05:03:26] <MootPoot> quiz
[05:03:57] <MootPoot> but now that I actually know what was in the test
[05:04:00] <sentionics> glad it was only $10, but it sucks to pay for nothing.
[05:04:02] <MootPoot> ez pass
[05:04:27] <MootPoot> no, I went there with the mindset to pay for the price of knowing what the test actually had on it
[05:04:31] <MootPoot> not actually passing
[05:04:42] <sentionics> well, technically not 'nothing', you now are prepared to actually pass the quiz.
[05:04:50] <MootPoot> its funny cuz the "study guide" from the govt is like 30 dollars
[05:05:03] <MootPoot> I effectively got the same knowlege for 10 bucks

[05:05:23] <sentionics> lol, just failing the quiz once is better value. 5head play

[05:05:50] <MootPoot> we'll see

[05:05:54] <sentionics> you've unlocked a new quiz difficulty level.
[05:06:05] <MootPoot> not gonna buy much from them anymore
[05:06:21] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  I ordered a 1.6L MSR alpine pot for like 50 bucks
[05:06:22] <sentionics> pricing or something?
[05:06:25] <MootPoot> then I was jsut googling
[05:06:31] <MootPoot> IRL store has it for 32
[05:06:45] <MootPoot> I've started to buy from IRL stores more often now
[05:06:48] <sentionics> that's not surprising for some goods.
[05:06:49] <ButterNoodle> thats ur fault.. always shop
[05:06:50] <MootPoot> cheaper and faster to get stfuff
[05:06:56] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  nah just cancelled the order
[05:07:00] <MootPoot> got my money back
[05:07:15] <MootPoot> I was looking too hard for a good quality foldable pan and pot combo
[05:07:24] <MootPoot> I stopped thinking about getting them seperate
[05:07:34] <sentionics> for example, you'll pay more for food stuffs ordered via amazon, unless you live in a high cost of living area.
[05:07:41] <MootPoot> sometimes...
[05:07:47] <MootPoot> if its nothing special
[05:08:00] <MootPoot> with the amazon 15% off if you have sceduled orders you can get it pretty cheap 
[05:08:03] <MootPoot> even cheaper then IRL
[05:08:14] <ButterNoodle> yea I always check my local mom and pop camping store
[05:08:16] <MootPoot> BUT....I stopped using it cuz every 2 months the suppliers would vanish
[05:08:36] <MootPoot> and I would lose my discount
[05:08:47] <ButterNoodle> even if its a few dollars more, I buy local
[05:09:03] <MootPoot> I have a policy for buying stuff
[05:09:08] <MootPoot> buy cheap chinesium
[05:09:16] <MootPoot> if it breaks, then go all the way to the top or near top 
[05:09:18] <MootPoot> in price

[05:12:01] <MootPoot> fortunately electricity is pretty cheap here
[05:12:11] <MootPoot> costs me about 16-20 dollars a month to run mine 24/7
[05:12:38] <sentionics> sounds like maybe not so bad to do crypto mining then with that cheap electricity

[12:50:01] <DunceCotus> its fun to have fun
[12:50:26] <amigojapan> Yes DunceCotus !
[12:50:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I had a dream about a minecraft-like game
[12:50:33] <DunceCotus> but it was VR
[12:50:44] <DunceCotus> and people didn't realise they were playing a game, thought it was real life
[12:50:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: make it in 3dpl
[12:50:54] <DunceCotus> so they formed small communities depending on where they spawn
[12:51:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan nah
[12:51:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: a bit like Sao
[12:52:08] <DunceCotus> perhaps, I haven't watched SAO
[12:52:33] <DunceCotus> or read
[12:53:32] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Sao people are playing a vr game which if they lose, it kills them in real life
[12:53:36] <DunceCotus> actually I may have watched the first episode
[12:53:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan ah
[12:53:54] <death916> .hack is better
[12:53:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well they still know they're playing a game tho
[12:54:14] <amigojapan> Right DunceCotus 
[12:54:20] <DunceCotus> in my dream they don't know.. but I knew somehow in the dream
[12:54:24] <DunceCotus> but I also didn't know?
[12:54:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so it was like dreams where you usually don't know it is a dream
[12:55:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yeah
[12:55:31] <amigojapan> I see
[12:55:31] <DunceCotus> death916 .hack was surprisingly good
[12:56:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I think somehow I died in the game and spawned somewhere completely different and wanted to try to find my way back to the group I was with initially
[12:57:13] <DunceCotus> its like in minecraft where if you don't sleep in a bed you spawn randomly on the map
[12:57:48] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus 
[12:58:05] <DunceCotus> anyway it was a kind of hyperreal minecraft
[12:58:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan maybe made with an advanced version of 3dpl!
[12:59:11] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: are you saying 3dpl is but advanced?
[12:59:29] <amigojapan> Not advanced?
[12:59:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan no...
[12:59:37] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[12:59:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan just that its not exactly hyperreal (yet?)
[13:00:00] <amigojapan> It can make vr games tho
[13:00:03] <DunceCotus> like this was lifelike graphics
[13:00:10] <DunceCotus> but also blocky
[13:00:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I'm sure you can
[13:00:55] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you can put any texture on 3dpl blocks
[13:01:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yeah but what's the performance like

[13:01:26] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: this is something it is not advanced than Minecraft in
[13:01:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: depends on the computer
[13:02:17] <amigojapan> I meant more advanced than Minecraft
[13:02:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well minecraft you can also change textures on blocks
[13:02:38] <DunceCotus> so not sure what you mean
[13:03:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but you still need to use a texture map with limited textures
[13:03:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan how does it work with 3dpl?
[13:03:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: any bitmap can become a block in 3dpl
[13:04:07] <amigojapan> Even transparency works
[13:04:07] <DunceCotus> what do you mean
[13:04:17] <DunceCotus> 'become a block'
[13:04:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you can wrap any bitmap like a texture in 3dpl
[13:05:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan hmm ok
[13:05:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan can I port 3dpl to java
[13:05:41] <amigojapan> Why
[13:05:42] <DunceCotus> (im most familiar with java programming)
[13:06:11] <amigojapan> I don't like Java but I allow you if you can
[13:06:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well I guess my question is more 'is it possible to port'
[13:06:27] <DunceCotus> not can I
[13:06:45] <amigojapan> Yeah, it is possible
[13:06:50] <DunceCotus> ah
[13:07:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I'm wary of minecraft-likes tho
[13:07:07] <DunceCotus> even if minecraft wasn't the first
[13:07:20] <DunceCotus> but I like the idea of a fully destructable world
[13:07:23] <DunceCotus> with construction
[13:07:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I spent 10 years making 3dpl
[13:07:37] <DunceCotus> I was thinking of a minecraft but with smaller blocks
[13:07:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan ah I see
[13:07:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: why not just use 3dpl?
[13:08:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan did you get pissed off at minecraft?

[15:44:56] <DunceCotus> wat
[15:45:07] <amigojapan> They don't deliver medicines
[15:45:23] <amigojapan> You need to meet the doctor once per month
[15:45:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan strange
[15:46:01] <amigojapan> Once ever two months if you are healthy
[15:46:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan so there's no pharmacies?
[15:46:22] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: yeah, Japan can be strange
[15:46:55] <amigojapan> There are but you can only go with a new prescription after meeting the doctor
[15:47:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it does not make sense
[15:47:43] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, do phone appointments count for temporary emergency measures?
[15:47:52] <amigojapan> No
[15:48:00] <DunceCotus> for chronic conditions surely it'd be easier for doc to email or post prescriptions
[15:48:01] <Cryowolf> like "ok I'll give you this medicine and an appointment so you don't die before we meet"
[15:48:27] <amigojapan> You need to meet the doctor in person. Or someone in your family can go in your place
[15:48:30] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, so they won't even give you something to help you until the appointment? You'll just have to hope you don't get worse?
[15:48:47] <Cryowolf> what if they have no appointment for weeks?
[15:48:55] <Cryowolf> are you left without help then for weeks?

[16:24:23] <Cryowolf> yeah amigojapan, but do you know what a good achievement it is to steadily lose weight when obese or morbidly obese? Your bodys hunger hormones are messed up and they're not gonna go back to normal overnight so you are using a lot of personal strength and discipline to do this
[16:24:31] <Cryowolf> you should be proud of yourself and keep it up

[17:44:47] <il> They encourage focusing on the music
[17:46:09] <Sadale> intresting. how does that work?
[17:46:15] <Sadale> Is that noise cancelling earphone?
[17:46:18] <il> No
[17:46:47] <il> They're just have a very 'flat' response. No frequency range is particularly boosted. The mid and high ends are very clear and detailed, the bass isn't exaggerated.
[17:47:10] <il> The 'resolution' is extremely high, you get to hear all the defects in the recording and reproduction
[17:47:21] <Sadale> interesting.

[17:47:47] <il> and I'm probably going to get one more
[17:47:49] <Sadale> I wish I could get a headphone with "flat" response. But I wouldn't be able to tell if certain headphone is flat without any measurement equipment.
[17:47:59] <il> Sadale, you can hear it
[17:48:35] <Sadale> comparatively speaking, yes. But I'm wondering if absolute (or almost absolute) flat response headphone exist.
[17:48:37] <il> Get studio monitors (speakers) if you have a room you can sound deaden
[17:48:40] <il> and if you have money
[17:48:50] <il> If not try finding good IEMs or studio monitoring headphones
[17:48:53] <Sadale> nah I don't have a dedicated room :(

[17:49:36] <il> get koss KPH30i

[19:25:04] <il> while working out, of course... my life is a colossal mess
[19:25:10] <amigojapan> Publios: turns out it was mostly caused by carbs and sugars

[19:27:19] <Nanobot> Gaining 15 kilos is easy. That's like one bite of cheese. A typical person eats over 2000 kilos a day.
[19:27:29] <Nanobot> kilocalories
[19:27:30] <amigojapan> Publios: I think keto works but not because of ketosis. I think it wokes by reducing carbs and sugars dramatically
[19:27:41] <il> Nanobot, yeah, not easy for someone who has never been not-skinny lol
[19:27:49] <il> I'd have to eat around 3600 calories a day for around half a year
[19:27:53] <il> while working out
[19:28:01] <il> with 50/25/25 macro split

[19:29:20] <amigojapan> Nanobot: cheese is fine. But not bread, spaghetti. Pizza. Rice. Tortillas and sugar and high fructose corn syrup
[19:29:32] <Nanobot> Different weightloss diets are essentially just different strategies for achieving a calorie deficit.
[19:29:51] <Publios> there is a reason keto diets work so well
[19:30:09] <il> I don't think keto is healthy
[19:30:20] <il> I think you should keep a healthy macro ratio with a caloric deficit
[19:30:25] <Nanobot> Keto diets work so well because meat is yummy and makes you feel satiated.
[19:31:19] <Nanobot> SlimFast diets work so well because chocolate is yummy and it's convenient.
[19:31:30] <MootPoot> +1 for slimfast
[19:32:04] <Publios> keto is close to a paleo diet. not sure grain heavy diets are great either
[19:32:18] <il> Nanobot, talking about meat being yummy, I should get some kikkoman soy sauce for my rice

[19:33:42] <il> it's one of the best tastes lol
[19:33:50] <il> But yeah, you can add umami taste to a lot of foods with soy sauce
[19:33:52] <il> That's why it's great
[19:33:53] <Publios> probably why we love salsa (tomatoe based) so much
[19:34:00] <Publios> tomato*
[19:34:08] <amigojapan> Nanobot: I tried slim fast in about 2000. Did not work for me. Keto is the only diet that has worked for me
[19:34:16] <Nanobot> Asian sauces are great for diets. They add so much nice satisfying flavor without a lot of calories. Chicken stir fry is a meal that feels like it's a lot more calories than it is.
