[03:44:36] <lantech19446> I've always had kind of a negative impression of comptia the A+ just pisses me off because of the way it's used but there's a package available for 49 dollars with courses in itf+ security+ casp network+ linux+ pentest+ project+ server+ cloud+ and cysa+ would any of these help me transition into devops?
[03:45:44] <Dus10> only in getting you familiar with those topics
[03:46:12] <Dus10> I am a firm believer that you should know the fundamentals, if not better, for the things that you're working on with DevOps
[03:46:39] <Dus10> I never took the A+ exam until I was going to teach a course covering the material and they required that I have the certification
[03:46:56] <Dus10> I knew most of it pretty well since I had been doing it for 20 years, at the time
[03:47:02] <Dus10> it isn't a bad exam, though
[03:47:10] <Dus10> it is just entry level
[03:48:00] <Dus10> if you really want to understand hardware, I would recommend the following book: https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319
[03:48:14] <Dus10> it goes beyond hardware, but it is great
[03:50:28] <lantech19446> The only reason A+ pisses me off is because it is an entry level cert comptia says it's equivlent to the first 2yrs in the field but you see job listings who want 10yrs and an a+ is required and it's like wtf
[03:50:58] <Dus10> sounds like something to stop worrying about
[03:51:46] <lantech19446> I guess I won't bother spending the money on it, if it was going to make me more hirable I'd do it but i can get the knowledge without taking the cert
[03:54:03] <Dus10> yeah, but if you have the knowledge... why not have the cert?
[03:55:23] <Dus10> as someone that hires folks, I know that certs don't mean much... but the folks that tell me that they know things but don't see the value in the certs are of two types: 1) aren't good test takers and get anxiety, or 2) don't actually know the material as well as they would like people to think
[03:56:18] <Dus10> if you have to spend an hour trying to give a reason why you don't want to do a cert... you probably wouldn't make my cut
[03:56:37] <rawtaz> damn Dus10 you have such high standards!
[03:56:43] <Dus10> if you just say, eh, I don't feel like it... I would be far more accepting of that than a novel
[03:57:49] <lantech19446> Dus10: i'm caught in a conundrum I do have anxiety but that isn't the main reason for not taking them. The main reason is i don't have the money, if i can get a job that pays better without them and i'm living less paycheck to paycheck then there's several I want but right now it's the difference between keeping a roof over my head and food in my mouth
[03:58:41] <Dus10> lantech19446: I hate to break it to you, but your far from the first person to be in such a situation... you gotta invest in yourself if you want to see change
[03:58:56] <Dus10> I started out not knowing jack, not being paid jack, and I had a family
[03:59:15] <Dus10> I made $12/hr and had nobody coddling me... and I had two kids
[03:59:28] <Dus10> I decided I was making a change
[03:59:47] <lantech19446> I know there's a lot of people in my position especially here and I'm trying to invest in myself by buying the subscription to udemy and i do classes every single night. I want to make this happen I just don't know how i'd spend 300 dollars on a test
[03:59:51] <Dus10> that does require using your head
[03:59:56] <rawtaz> lantech19446: you just have to focus more                       and stop overthinking things :)
[04:00:08] <Dus10> find a college program that includes it
[04:00:17] <Dus10> the class that I literally just finished teaching was A+
[04:00:37] <Dus10> the college that I teach at is super affordable and financial aid is a thing
[04:00:44] <lantech19446> none of the colleges around here that teach the courses include the test, they might have a discounted voucher but that's about it
[04:00:50] <Dus10> they have A+, Network+, Security+, and AWS stuff
[04:01:07] <Dus10> "none of the colleges around here..."
[04:01:12] <lantech19446> I don't think I'm even eligible for finaid right now i'm in default on 2 student loans I owe like 56000 dollars
[04:01:14] <Dus10> dude... it is 2021
[04:01:36] <Dus10> well, then I don't have much help, that is a bad pickle to be in
[04:01:55] <Dus10> one doesn't just happen into a situation like that, unfortunately
[04:02:21] <rawtaz> jesus christ
[04:02:49] <lantech19446> this is the result of a very long time battling depression and bipolar and not giving a shit about anything I mean literally all of it it's why i've never gotten a new job it's why my finances are a mess I just stopped giving a shit and now i'm trying to clean it all up
[04:02:57] <Dus10> there are often state-level programs that might help, though
[04:03:23] <lantech19446> possibly, never thought of that
[04:04:59] <rawtaz> why not keep this simple
[04:05:07] <rawtaz> stop overanalyzing every fucking little thing in the entire IT industry
[04:05:08] <lantech19446> interesting, my local community college has aws cloud architecting an cloud developing but neither of those are entry level are they?
[04:05:25] <rawtaz> sit down, learn one or two things, do them well, then you can show an employer that you know stuff for real, and get a job within that
[04:05:33] <rawtaz> you are just going around in circles
[04:06:00] <rawtaz> heck, FWIW you could learn to develop wordpress sites and youd probably have as much work as you want :D
[04:06:06] <rawtaz> it'd be horrible though lol
[04:07:08] <lantech19446> rawtaz: i started out trying to learn webdev and thought about doing that until I installed wordpress and realized how god awful it would be to work with but I find the devops stuff much more interesting and that's part of why i'm just grasping at everything I want to learn it all and i haven't calmed down yet
[04:08:06] <rawtaz> yeah but you cant grasp at everything because you can waste years learning a bit but not enough :)
[04:09:05] <Dus10> yeah, you have to learn to focus
[04:09:06] <Dus10> it is a life skill
[04:09:44] <Dus10> you can't blame it on ADHD, bipolar, or things like that... everybody is broken somehow, I know that I am
[04:10:13] <Dus10> you have to decide for yourself that this is important and make a plan and stick to at least to a point
[04:10:22] <lantech19446> believe it or not i'm more focused right now than I have been in the last 30yrs I just keep accumulating stuff on a list of things to learn but right now i'm focusing on learning python and ansible and next will probably be aws
[04:10:41] <Dus10> quit looking for things to add to the list
[04:10:59] <Dus10> if you want to do some of the things we've talked about... go learn a single cloud platform
[04:11:03] <Dus10> pick one and just one
[04:11:10] <Dus10> AWS, or Azure, or GCP
[04:11:25] <Dus10> learn it well enough to pass its equivalent associate level exam
[04:11:28] <lantech19446> I'm going to learn aws and will most likely follow through with the certs from them
[04:11:45] <Dus10> then learn to do the same stuff with Terraform, after you have gotten to that level
[04:11:56] <Dus10> you might also check your local library
[04:12:02] <rawtaz> the problem with that is that its close to impossible to get a *relevant* level of experience with them though.. i mean you can lab around with stuff and aws services and so on, but its not until you actually get to work with a real infrastructure that you have anything to show in terms of merit, no?
[04:12:05] <Dus10> sometimes they have good resources for this stuff
[04:13:43] <lantech19446> https://imgur.com/a/jBAxvPr
[04:13:48] <Dus10> well, you have to do something, if you're in that position, rawtaz
[04:13:50] <lantech19446> check out where I am right now Dus10 
[04:13:59] <Dus10> if you don't have experience, you have to study
[04:14:17] <Dus10> lantech19446: good
[04:14:30] <lantech19446> I spend 8-11 hours a day in the library, I'm the network admin
[04:14:41] <Dus10> well, good deal
[04:14:58] <lantech19446> yea honestly I love my job it just doesn't pay well if it did i'd never leave it
[04:14:59] <Dus10> a public library or a university library?
[04:15:03] <lantech19446> public
[04:15:27] <Dus10> I would expect that there would be some information there about different government programs that could help
[04:15:38] <Dus10> how long have you worked at the library
[04:15:51] <lantech19446> occasionally we get presenters but with covid it's been few and far between
[04:15:57] <lantech19446> I've been here 13yrs
[04:16:42] <Dus10> man... so... this stinks, but with 13 years... you might have been able to have those student loans forgiven if you paid the minimum for 10 years
[04:17:14] *** Quits: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[04:17:36] <lantech19446> yep but the minimum was so high that I couldn't pay it and once i got married even idr is like 500 a month
[04:17:41] <rawtaz> Dus10: yeah im just saying that if someone doesnt know devops stuff, its hard to get *relevant* experience on their own - its not until you actually get to work with it in a real business environment with real infra and real needs that you start gaining some relevant experience.
[04:18:13] <rawtaz> im not talking about myself, im talking in general. dont you agree? do you think that expeirence in devops built up with some fiddling around in a small lab env can be relevant and lead to being hired?
[04:18:16] <Dus10> eh, well, you can always learn to use Terraform and stuff with your on-premises stuff
[04:18:35] <rawtaz> yeah but thats a drop in the ocean
[04:18:37] <Dus10> the same patterns work on-premises as in the cloud
[04:18:44] <Dus10> better than nothing
[04:18:45] <lantech19446> that was why ansible was one of the first things I learned I built a controller in my work and i'm using it for things
[04:18:47] <rawtaz> and the things you can come up with in your lab is not even close to real world usage of it
[04:19:10] <rawtaz> and things like actual dev pipelines and automation is something thats just beyond small lab envs i think
[04:19:28] <Dus10> lantech19446: I am pretty sure your minimum payment will be less than $500/month if you're not doing well... mine is $500/month for about the same amount and I don't have income-based repayment
[04:19:28] <lantech19446> honestly I think both of you are right
[04:19:32] <rawtaz> would you think of hiring someone who havent got real world experience, but at most did some stuff in their lab?
[04:19:57] <Dus10> you have to do something in that situation, rawtaz
[04:20:03] <Dus10> if you don't do anything at all, you won't get anywhere
[04:20:11] <lantech19446> Dus10: I've tried my idr was 498 a month there's no provision for lots of bills it's based solely on income
[04:20:51] <lantech19446> also your wife's income is included once you're married
[04:21:01] <Dus10> I wouldn't hire someone in that position for one of my jobs... but we are doing consulting
[04:21:01] <lantech19446> between the two of us we make like 60k a year
[04:21:01] <Dus10> if I were running an IT deptartment at a small/medium company, I could find something for someone
[04:21:15] <Dus10> yeah... you would get less, I am thinking
[04:21:26] <Dus10> I dunno
[04:21:56] <Dus10> it sucks, but there are also side jobs and things that you can do
[04:22:01] <lantech19446> I'm not expecting to start at a senior level but it won't be hard to make more than I'm making now i'd be ok with like 50-60k a year and grow into a better position I just have to find the right people to give me a chance
[04:22:16] <Dus10> I work two jobs as it is... but the teaching job is mostly because it is easy and part-time and I like it
[04:22:25] <rawtaz> Dus10: im not sure you see what im saying. i am saying that someone who does a lot of learning and lab stuff will still not have REAL WORLD AND RELEVANT expeirence. noone will hire someone who fiddled around a bit with terraform and didnt even come close to a real world devops pipeline simply because you dont when you dont have any real world data and needs and requirements to work with. would you?
[04:22:49] <rawtaz> im talking about the difference between real world experience and lab experience
[04:22:51] <lantech19446> yea right now i'm working full time my wife is working two jobs if i can find a remote job for overnight i'd totally do it but i have to be able to drive her and pick her up
[04:22:53] <Dus10> rawtaz: nah, I completely get it.  I have been there.
[04:23:25] <Dus10> do you have kids?
[04:23:34] <lantech19446> me? no
[04:23:34] <rawtaz> in some other contexts such as softwaer development it can be done, you can learn and show that you know sutff that are good enough to be hired. but devops is of the type where you simple need to work on a bigger scale to get that real world experience
[04:23:48] <lantech19446> we've made a conscious decision to not have kids right now
[04:23:49] <Dus10> do you live in an expensive geography?
[04:24:10] <lantech19446> yes east coast near philly
[04:24:12] <Dus10> rawtaz: I am not saying he would get a DevOps job, but you can turn nearly any sysadmin/netadmin/dev job into a DevOps job
[04:25:02] <Dus10> lantech19446: I would have to think there is a way for you to work this stuff out... I was making $25k and support my wife and two kids
[04:25:17] <Dus10> hell, I had a third kid by the time I was making $40k
[04:25:25] <lantech19446> Dus10: how on earth did you pull that off that's like poverty level
[04:25:41] <Dus10> determination
[04:25:56] <Dus10> honestly, I coasted for a bit of time...
[04:26:05] <lantech19446> there are cases where determination doesn't mean anything, you can only stretch a dollar so far
[04:26:09] <Dus10> my wife said that she was going to go to school... so I worked and waited
[04:26:32] <Dus10> lantech19446: see, that is the first thing that you have to do... stop feeling helpless
[04:26:48] <rawtaz> no time for that :D
[04:27:21] <Dus10> my wife didn't go to school, so after two years I decided enough was enough... enrolled in a program to do the MCSE with financial aid money (which was a waste of time and money, but I got it)
[04:27:34] <Dus10> at that point, I could find a job making a little bit more
[04:27:52] <Dus10> I immediately started working on my uni degree at that point
[04:28:18] <Dus10> by the time I was halfway through (going to school full-time in the evenings while working full-time), I was able to make about $50k
[04:28:29] <Dus10> it is all incremental
[04:28:47] <Dus10> that job you have right now, probably will never have much of any opportunity to get a raise
[04:29:01] <Dus10> right now is the time to find a job that pays more
[04:29:09] <Dus10> it is an employee's market right now
[04:29:24] <Dus10> you have some skills... go get $10k more for your skills
[04:29:31] <lantech19446> the schooling I did do was MCSA and i graduated top of my class, they promised us the world and by the time i graduated the economy had collapsed and i've been here ever since
[04:29:57] <Dus10> yeah... some for-profit thing?
[04:30:03] <Dus10> that is what I did for my MCSE
[04:30:08] <lantech19446> lincoln tech
[04:30:12] <Dus10> it was a complete waste and cost $10k
[04:30:15] <Dus10> yeah, close enough
[04:31:39] <lantech19446> I started off going for security they changed my mind because i already knew more than a lot of their students about computers but I didn't know I could get a job teaching myself all that stuff or I wouldn't have spent the money
[04:32:02] <Dus10> I was in the same boat
[04:32:17] <Dus10> I got a super shitty job with a bunch of really smart people making $12/hr
[04:32:29] <Dus10> they all had degrees and certs and were making over $100k
[04:32:33] <lantech19446> I started at under 10 I'm making 15 now
[04:32:44] <Dus10> they all would just say, yeah, read a book... take the test
[04:32:57] <Dus10> well, I hadn't done any of that and didn't know anything
[04:33:03] <Dus10> so, it was super intimidating
[04:33:15] <Dus10> I didn't think self-study was realistic
[04:33:54] <lantech19446> the only thing that makes school more realistic for me is it gives me a set plan vs constantly finding new stuff I want to learn
[04:34:09] <Dus10> that is what I liked
[04:34:18] <Dus10> but I eventually realized that I could self-study
[04:34:29] <Dus10> it became more realistic
[04:34:54] <Dus10> https://dced.pa.gov/business-assistance/workforce-development/
[04:34:56] <Dus10> Check there
[04:35:22] <Dus10> they have to have something
[04:35:30] <Dus10> we have stuff all day long
[04:35:49] <Dus10> there are people in my classes going through a state program and it is fully funded
[04:36:12] <Dus10> people that have a bachelors degree from a private university and are working in the food service industry...
[04:36:25] <lantech19446> I know we have something in pennsylvania that provides 3000 dollars but you only qualify if you're unemployed or in an at risk industry
[04:36:52] <Dus10> I would think that since you're a public employee, they would have something available for you
[04:37:17] <Dus10> I don't know if you're municipal or otherwise, but you might see if you have a Microsoft partnership
[04:37:23] <Dus10> they have something called ESI
[04:37:31] <Dus10> it has free classes and exam vouchers
[04:37:53] <lantech19446> if we do our department isn't included in it because we're "autonomous"
[04:38:12] <Dus10> that sort of thing is usually still included
[04:38:27] <Dus10> the Microsoft stuff, that is
[04:41:13] <lantech19446> i know we don't get it, I'm not sure if the borough does or not
[04:41:13] <Dus10> do you have O365 accounts?
[04:41:23] <lantech19446> yes we got them through techsoup
[04:41:28] <Dus10> if so, just try to sign in
[04:41:32] <Dus10> esi.microsoft.com
[04:41:44] <Dus10> use your O365 sign in
[04:41:50] <Dus10> it will tell you if you have any benefits
[04:42:06] <lantech19446> nope email address is not eligible
[04:42:14] <Dus10> too bad
[04:42:22] <lantech19446> yea
[04:42:55] <Dus10> I dunno, I would start checking around to see if there is anything that you can get 
[04:43:16] <Dus10> I would also think you might be able to look for other jobs available that are government jobs
[04:43:28] <Dus10> maybe you could find something that pays more and has better training resources
[04:44:32] <lantech19446> i've been looking through job ads like every day, a lot of shit around here pays what i'm already making and i get top tier health benefits so I'd have to leave for more
[04:45:51] <lantech19446> which I gotta tell ya those health benefits are crucial i have a lot of health issues beyond the mental health stuff and my wife is a type 1 diabetic 
[04:46:02] *** Quits: predmijat (~predmijat@mail.strogopro.com) (Quit: bye)
[04:47:38] <Dus10> I hear you on the benefits front
[04:47:39] *** Joins: predmijat (~predmijat@mail.strogopro.com)
[04:47:53] <Dus10> we maintain double coverage for my wife because of chronic issues that she has
[04:48:39] <lantech19446> yea so you definitely understand. Between my wife and I if we didn't have absolutely free ER / ICU visits we'd be homeless right now in 2 visits we racked up 180,000 dollars
[04:49:21] <Dus10> that might be another way to look at your situation, though...
[04:49:38] <Dus10> either one of our insurance plans wouldn't be very good, although mine is considered "good"
[04:49:46] <Dus10> but combined, they fix things
[04:50:08] <Dus10> so, if you can make more with a worse plan, maybe you can mitigate that by having a secondary plan
[04:50:36] <lantech19446> it's one of the major reasons for not leaving I pay 70 dollars a month for health insurance that costs them close to 20,000 a year where else will I get that I need to make enough to buy that level plan
[04:50:57] <Dus10> golden handcuffs
[04:51:09] <lantech19446> we did that for a little bit but the 2nd plan was such shit it just made things too stressful
[04:52:34] <Dus10> well, we have been doing it for 12 years now
[04:52:44] <Dus10> you have to get the primary versus secondary worked out
[04:52:55] <Dus10> once you have that handled, it is easy
[04:53:12] <Dus10> early on, I had both plans under my name, so that made it more complicated
[04:53:25] <lantech19446> what we ran into was that a lot of places refused to submit to two insurances
[04:53:45] <Dus10> I don't think that they have a choice
[04:54:19] <lantech19446> apparently they're only strapped into it if it's medicare or medicaid
[04:54:38] <Dus10> neither of ours are medicare or medicaid
[04:55:33] <lantech19446> apparently you just have more cooperative providers than we do then
[04:55:48] <lantech19446> even quest wouldn't do it
[04:56:09] <Dus10> I dunno, my wife has all sorts of people she deals with and it has never been an issue
[04:56:34] <Dus10> I have thought about developing a prescription app based on the unique requirements she has created
[04:56:38] <lantech19446> I hope it continues that way for you, these doctors made shit a royal clusterfuck for us
[04:56:58] <lantech19446> sounds interesting
[04:57:09] <Dus10> she is on a ton of stuff
[04:58:01] <Dus10> she has 3 medications for migraines from her neurologist, like 8 from her rheumatologist for her two auto-immune diseases... blood pressure meds to fix what her other meds do...
[04:58:06] <Dus10> it is a bit of a nightmare
[04:58:33] <Dus10> I get pretty frustrated with her because she will say "I don't feel well"... that doesn't tell me anything...
[04:58:38] <lantech19446> i'm on 10 regularly and 3 as needed plus a cpap
[04:58:51] <Dus10> you gotta tell me what kind of "not well" you're feeling right now
[04:59:00] <lantech19446> oh that's the other good thing with my insurance we don't pay a dime for dme which gets me my cpap and my wife her cgm and pump
[04:59:26] <Dus10> there is this other thing that is out there to replace a cpap now
[04:59:33] <Dus10> it is inside your airway
[04:59:35] <lantech19446> I know the feeling man my wife has fibro and she'll say i'm in so much pain and i have to say is it everything or something new
[04:59:44] <Dus10> you get a remote to turn it on
[05:00:10] <lantech19446> haven't seen that I've seen the thing that creates positive pressure by sitting in your nasal passage but i was told it wouldn't work for me
[05:00:27] <Dus10> hmm
[05:00:36] <Dus10> https://www.inspiresleep.com/
[05:00:46] <Dus10> that might be the same thing that you saw
[05:01:47] <lantech19446> no that's something different, this is kinda cool i just wish they told me how it keeps the airway open
[05:02:03] <Dus10> I am curious about that, myself
[05:02:42] <lantech19446> i don't know that my doctor would recommend it because my treatment on cpap works so well but it's cool that they're coming up with new things
[05:03:24] <lantech19446> apparently it works through stimulation have to click on the for healthcare providers link
[05:04:29] <lantech19446> I wouldn't qualify for it looking at the eligibility requirements my ahi untreated was well over 100 i'm well treated on cpap and i'm morbidly obese
[05:08:43] <lantech19446> i find it curious how many job listings I see where they follow agile methodology but i've never heard anyone say a good word about it
[05:17:29] <lantech19446> Dus10: thanks for talking for so long man I just realized i only have 8 minutes left in the work day and i got through it without anxiety cuz i was preoccupied with good conversation
[05:18:00] <Dus10> np
[05:18:40] <Dus10> agile can be useful... I think it is an improvement on what has been done with Waterfall, but it isn't without its shortcomings
[05:38:50] <Dus10> btw, I am really hating the Azure vWAN stuff right now
[05:39:14] <Dus10> I have what I wanted to accomplish working, but such a pain to rework it from a traditional Hub-and-Spoke architecture
[05:53:03] <lantech19446> I've always shied away from azure I don't know why 
[06:08:08] <lantech19446> Dus10: have you seen this deal from google?
[06:08:31] <lantech19446> if you sign up by january 10th you get 30 days free courses skill badges etc on google cloud
[06:16:12] <Dus10> cool
[06:16:30] <Dus10> Microsoft runs deals occasionally, as well
[06:16:38] <Dus10> they run these Cloud Skills Challenges
[06:16:55] <Dus10> you complete some tasks in Microsoft Learn (free resource) and they give you an exam voucher for free
[06:19:38] <lantech19446> nice
[06:22:09] <lantech19446> I'd be an idiot not to take advantage of it
