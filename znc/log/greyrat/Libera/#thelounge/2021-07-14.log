[00:00:06] <lous1F> this is a channel called #thelounge , it's usually the "lounge" of the server, off-topic etc
[00:00:28] <lous1F> but I understand
[00:00:28] <lous1F> keep it on topic
[00:00:57] <JohnDoe2> of course, we wouldn't want to pollute the otherwise busy chatter about thelounge ðŸ˜†
[00:03:17] <Snuupy> #thelounge (an irc client channel) is not #lounge (a place to discuss misc)
[00:03:51] <lous1F> I think it's pretty funny when people try to enforce "keeping it on topic" when most of the time that is just limiting the conversation,
[00:04:13] <Snuupy> it's in the wrong channel
[00:05:51] <lous1F> & I read the topic, but haven't checked out the client yet. something I need to host
[00:06:01] <bookworm> lous1F: if we don't enforce the topic, the channel degrades to a completely unusable mess... and if people would actually read the topic they're given by, you know, the topic message we wouldn't need to do so ;)
[00:06:55] <aab_> what I meant lous1F was take this discussion to #thelounge-offtopic since you are not talking about the lounge client lol
[00:06:55] <lous1F> I've been on irc since aol. so yeah.. heh
[00:07:17] <lous1F> no, before that even.
[00:07:28] <bookworm> again, take it to -offtopic *please*
[00:08:18] <lous1F> fine I'll type the extra letters then end the convo. lol
[00:08:58] <JohnDoe2> alright, fine, I'll save the day: does thelounge have a parser I can hook into to get things like `code snippets` highlighted?
[00:09:13] <bookworm> CSS, yes
[00:09:31] <bookworm> if by "highlighted" you mean color them differently than what the theme gives you
[00:09:56] <lous1F> <Snuupy> #thelounge (an irc client channel) is not #lounge (a place to discuss misc)
[00:09:58] <JohnDoe2> right but they would have to be identified separately, right now it's just a blob of text (the chat content)
[00:10:26] <lous1F> when you do /list , which would you join first
[00:10:51] <JohnDoe2> generally parsers tokenize and return something like <span class="code">`something`</span>
[00:11:06] <lous1F> I'm interested in hosting an irc client on one of my domains, is actually why I ended up here. lol
[00:11:25] <aab_> good, lets see if you can install it
[00:11:32] <aab_> and configure it successfully
[00:11:56] <lous1F> but I hope whoever the registrant for libera.chat is can handle registering a domain for more than 1 year..
[00:12:01] <lous1F> whois libera.chat
[00:12:12] <bookworm> JohnDoe2: not sure I follow, in IRC you can either send plain text say `that thing` or you can actually format it, like `that thing`
[00:12:32] <bookworm> the latter *does* have a different css class attached to it so you can style it
[00:12:41] <JohnDoe2> see? that have irc-monospace class
[00:12:52] <JohnDoe2> how did you format?
[00:12:56] <bookworm> if you want to style (and somehow parse) the plain text as markdown or some such, that's not currently possible
[00:12:57] <bookworm> C-m
[00:12:58] <JohnDoe2> that has*
[00:13:01] <bookworm> !colors
[00:13:01] <wendy> bookworm: Ctrl-K brings up a color menu, pressing , shows background colors
[00:13:19] <bookworm> click the help thing on the lefthand side
[00:13:22] <JohnDoe2> oh, I thought it was because of ` ...
[00:13:31] <bookworm> there's a bunch of things like striketrough, bold and such
[00:13:50] <lous1F> here.. use this font. lol @ this issue though.. https://github.com/kika/fixedsys/issues/21
[00:13:51] <bookworm> do keep in mind that they don't translate well to other clients though, so use them (very) sparingly
[00:14:23] <JohnDoe2> yup, that makes sense, and yes, it's not IRC doing the formatting, it would be thelounge alone by parsing the text
[00:14:43] <bookworm> well, it sends non printable ascii characters that get interpreted differently, but yes
[00:14:55] <lous1F> inside of somebody's web browser?
[00:15:01] <bookworm> it's supported by irccloud, textual and a bunch of others
[00:15:02] <JohnDoe2> sorry, I meant about implementing the `code` parsing
[00:15:16] <JohnDoe2> otherwise color codes are generally implemented in all irc clients at this point
[00:15:36] <bookworm> TL should most definitively not parse stuff as markdown that isn't marked as such
[00:15:49] <bookworm> and such an ircv3 spec doesn't exist yet
[00:16:01] <bookworm> there was actually a discussion about that in #ircv3 not too long ago
[00:16:30] <bookworm> the general consens, make a non standard capability (/ message tag) and go have fun, but it won't lead to a ircv3 spec as of now
[00:16:38] <JohnDoe2> I think it's too late for the irc protocol to grow, it wasn't build with that in mind.
[00:16:57] <bookworm> well, it did grow, hence we have a bunch of nice features in TL itself
[00:17:18] <JohnDoe2> again, I'm not arguing protocol, or going crazy hacking up some crazy custom IRCD, all I'm asking is: does thelounge use a parser?
[00:17:28] <JohnDoe2> and the answer is most likely no given your answers so far
[00:17:31] <bookworm> yes, for the IRC protocol
[00:17:35] <lous1F> if anyone needs translation code, here... https://libretranslate.com/
[00:17:47] <bookworm> lous1F: final warning
[00:18:02] <lous1F> pip install libretranslate
[00:18:23] <lous1F> I'm talking irc client/chat translate code
[00:18:37] <bookworm> there's no infrastructure for it in TL
[00:19:03] <lous1F> ok
[00:21:25] <lous1F> whoever "REDACTED FOR PRIVACY" is has a registrar I've used

[16:15:10] <Snuupy> wonder if this could be used in place of compiling ourselves for those of us on arm64/armv7
[16:16:08] <Snuupy> kuroshi: the appropriate place to put the blame is apple, they intentionally restrict features such as web notifications to build a moat around their ecosystem
[16:16:55] <Snuupy> https://caniuse.com/notifications every other major browser/OS supports it except: iOS

[16:22:41] <bl1nk> Snuupy: sharp is using precompiled binaries if available. They are not available for all architecture/libc combinations supported by the docker images in thelounge-docker
[16:23:13] <Snuupy> bl1nk: I'm actually using your repo right now for my arm64 build lol
[16:23:34] <Snuupy> had to poke around a bit, cd alpine, I'm not as familiar with docker build commands, etc
[16:23:43] <Snuupy> trying 4.3.0-pre4 now
[16:24:55] <Snuupy> bl1nk: is sharp causing the issue or is libvips for arm/arm64
[16:25:40] <Snuupy> ah looks like the issue is sharp, https://github.com/lovell/sharp-libvips/releases no arm32
[16:26:02] <Snuupy> you can build it manually though, right?
[16:26:07] <bl1nk> You can check https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#prebuilt-binaries - It might just work for your libc-architecture-combination.
[16:26:15] <bl1nk> Yes, should be possible to built it
[16:26:34] <Snuupy> I'm on arm64 so I can't replicate the arm32 issue
[16:26:49] <Snuupy> my raspberry pis are too new and my oracle cloud ampere instance is also arm64
[16:27:04] <Snuupy> but I did get your repo to build for 4.3.0-pre4
[16:27:58] <bl1nk> You can cross-compile locally using docker buildx, check out the Github actions for instructions on how to do it: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker-image-push.yml
[16:28:22] <bl1nk> arm64 actually should not need any compiling from source as long as your glibc or musllibc are new enough
[16:28:22] <Snuupy> oh interesting
[16:28:32] <Snuupy> did you end up getting it working on your rpi0?
[16:30:18] <bl1nk> I did not invest more time in getting it to work. Not sure what the latest status was. Also, as far as I know, it's not clear whether sharp will be kept as a dependency
[16:31:23] <bl1nk> Judging by the last Github actions run in my repository arm7 with musl should work with that Dockerfile
[16:31:40] <Snuupy> ah I see. I'm just going to get it working for my armv8 for now - I haven't updated in a long time and I want to set up the new search features
[16:31:45] <Snuupy> have to migrate everything over from my x86 box too

[19:33:42] <tumn> if anyone else has problems installing just update node
[19:34:10] <bookworm> s/install a proper OS/g ;P
[19:34:17] <bookworm> glad it worked out for you though
[19:34:29] <bookworm> you might want to enable backports
[19:34:52] <bookworm> else you'll have quite a bunch of similar problems in the future
[19:35:20] <tumn> backports are enabled
[19:35:28] <tumn> I just had a much older apt source for node
[19:35:42] <bookworm> oO which gives you node 11?
[19:36:17] <tumn> I was getting node 11 from an old .list file pointing to nodesource.com
[19:36:29] <tumn>  node doesn't distribute releases through official debian repos
[19:36:44] <bookworm> I see
[19:37:29] <tumn> it's a common problem that I believe stems from developers treating debian like it's ubuntu
[19:38:27] <bookworm> debian packaging isn't exactly great... we still have some problems with our package
[19:38:42] <bookworm> you don't happen to know debian packaging well do you?
[19:38:57] <tumn> I do not
[19:39:51] <tumn> are the problems to do with dependencies?
[19:40:47] <bookworm> oh, that we don't even try. No, but our systemd unit gets force enabled in a very unclean way and our permissions are fucked up
[19:41:32] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb/issues/71 and https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb/issues/70
[19:41:50] <tumn> well I can't offer any advice, but I can say as a user, I find installing packages from .deb files is always very screwy
[19:42:03] <bookworm> I've been looking into it, but the packaging system of debian is not only a mess but also poorly documented
[19:42:27] <bookworm> it's really not, a package manager is generally a very good thing
[19:42:42] <bookworm> just not the way debian does it ;)
[19:42:45] <tumn> I mean .deb files from disk
[19:42:50] <tumn> installing packages from repos is fine
[19:42:53] <bookworm> ah, yes
[19:43:13] <bookworm> then again, debian*again* makes it hard there to run your own
[19:44:20] <tumn> debian is a very old and mature distro, I recommend asking package maintainers for help
[19:44:46] <bl1nk> time for thelounge-flatpak. One packaging format to rule them all. :p
[19:44:56] <tumn> u will find the release cycle isn't cut out for very fast paced software 
[19:45:05] <tumn> also please no flatpaks....
[19:45:09] <bookworm> yep. Alas the non debian channel wasn't exactly helpful and proper debian wants you to split all dependencies, which simply won't happen
[19:45:47] <bookworm> no flatpacks, no snaps as far as I am concerned and docker only if you proof that you can administer it ;P
[19:45:57] <tumn> docker is a nightmare
[19:46:13] <tumn> honestly node is a nightmare too
[19:46:40] <bookworm> which is why we won't build a "proper" package for debian but our own little Frankenstein
[19:47:59] <tumn> I would love a prebuilt distribution of thelounge with everything it needs to run in 1 directory 
[19:48:40] <bookworm> it's JavaScript... not much to build and as long as you have the proper deps the from source fallback of sqlite should work.
[19:48:57] <bookworm> libvips on the other hand proofed to be painful
[19:49:29] <tumn> it's javascript yet so many build steps and a need to fetch remote dependencies with version requirements
[19:49:44] <bookworm> what I might suggest is a hard failure on the sqlite dep... but I can see why I would get pushback there
[19:50:26] <bookworm> I mean updating node should not be hard... after all you wouldn't run a ten year old OS... wait
[19:50:47] <tumn> debian 10 came out july 2019
[19:51:04] <bookworm> using software at least 5 years old, yes
[19:51:48] <bookworm> debian consistently annoys upstream devs and some told them to even remove their packages from the repo rather than to ship known buggy versions
[19:51:53] <tumn> software in the official debian repos doesn't update between major releases except for major bug fixes or security updates
[19:52:01] <tumn> that's deliberate
[19:52:23] <bookworm> I know, but that just bit you for a relatively easy js project
[19:53:02] <bookworm> in any case, we should shift the Debian rant to -offtopic, certainly me
[19:53:05] <tumn> my problem with thelounge was because I was sourcing node from an old 3rd party repo for debian 9
[19:53:36] <tumn> node cannot be distributed through debian officially because there is too much friction between it and debian's philosophy on releases
[19:53:51] <tumn> I personally blame node for this problem
[19:59:06] <Snuupy> can I interest you in some docker
