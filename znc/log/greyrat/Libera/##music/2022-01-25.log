[01:20:39] <DOMF> like, if you have a device that sends midi signals on all channels
[01:20:52] <DOMF> can you plug it in to that midi control box and have it output midi on one specific channel?

[01:21:15] <artao> yes. any and all channels
[01:21:23] <DOMF> (Some of hte pain I've been having lately has been trying to get different midi controllers to control different things simultaneously
[01:21:41] <artao> a really cool thing about MIDI in the computer these days is that you can specify which MIDI device to listen to, not just which MIDI channel
[01:21:43] <DOMF> I want my drum pads to only control drums, my keyboard to only control a specific synth, etc
[01:22:08] <nativetexan> makes sense
[01:22:25] <artao> well, you just have to set them to matched MIDI channels. Drums are often ch10 for some reason. I guess just to simplify and standardize? i dunno
[01:22:43] *** Joins: morlog (~morlog@user/morlog)

[20:14:44] <GaZ-mAnIaC> Old songs now represent 70 percent of the U.S. music market. Even worse: The new-music market is actually shrinking.
[20:15:22] <GaZ-mAnIaC> because most new music is very formulated with altered vocals
[20:17:41] <GaZ-mAnIaC> The Kid LAROI is a classic example

[20:21:52] <GaZ-mAnIaC> the new music doesn't have any authentic sound or originality to it
[20:22:55] <GaZ-mAnIaC> most of it is from the rap/bieber/swift tree

[20:27:39] <GaZ-mAnIaC> unlike some, i have actually worked in the music industry and have seen this go on since the mid 1990's, a much more formulated approach to music making, consolidation of music companies, less diversity of music picked to promote.

[20:33:00] <louipc> GaZ-mAnIaC: yea but arent they all just playing in casinos to old ppl
[20:33:25] <GaZ-mAnIaC> its not all bad, just some of the artists promoted by the major labels don't have the pop staying power
