[15:25:11] <pingpongball> i'm learning this , from scratch with before programming expriences ,https://gigamonkeys.com/book/syntax-and-semantics.html
[15:25:18] <pingpongball> How are you guys going that?
[15:25:22] <pingpongball> i use arch btw.
[15:27:39] <pjb> What CL implementation is available on arch?
[15:28:10] <pingpongball> i use emacs, and its all there
[15:28:27] <pjb> No, emacs currently doesn't include a CL implementation.
[15:28:41] <pjb> There was emacs-cl, a partial CL implementation, but it has bit-rotten since emacs added closures.
[15:29:00] <pjb> You're welcome to upgrade emacs-cl, it would be nice, but this would be a lot of work.
[15:29:01] <pingpongball> I use this doom emacs https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs  O:3
[15:29:08] <pingpongball> It have all there.
[15:29:45] <pjb> pingpongball: from emacs, you can access the CL environment with: M-x slime rET
[15:29:49] <pjb> does it work for you?
[15:30:09] <pjb> pingpongball: otherwise follow the instructions here: http://cliki.net/Getting+Started
[15:30:52] <pingpongball> oh i'll go to there people before recommended that book, i'll stick with it :)
[15:31:24] <pingpongball> yes doom emacs works , it have common-lisp, all lispy packages preinstalled or can be installed easy,

[15:31:59] <pjb> Ok, so what is the result of (lisp-implementation-type) for you?

[15:32:38] <pingpongball> CL-USER> (lisp-implementation-type) #| --> "Clozure Common Lisp" |#

[15:32:45] <pjb> Great.
[15:32:50] <pjb> So you're all set.
[15:32:53] <pingpongball> :)
[15:33:11] <pjb> Now, this question has a syntax error making it quite ambiguous, and I can't answer it: "How are you guys going that?"
[15:33:16] <pjb> What do you mean?
[15:34:01] <pingpongball> sorry for grammer mistake, i mean have you read that book? and wanted to gather its review
[15:34:26] <pjb> I browsed it. Others have read it.  It's highly regarded.

[22:28:29] <pjb> tewi: in part.
[22:29:07] <pjb> tewi: http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_eq.htm
[22:35:39] <tewi> so numbers and characters don't necessarily EQ even when they EQL because they might be internally stored in different memory locations depending on the implementation?
[22:36:44] <tewi> uhh sorry i forgot to mention pjb
[22:41:50] <pjb> yes.
[22:42:16] <tewi> so would it be accurate to say that what EQ does is just check if the two objects passed to it are stored in the same memory location?
[22:42:24] <pjb> More precisely, since characters and numbers are immutable, the implementation can make copies of them with no ill effect.
[22:42:35] <pjb> yes, basically, eq check for addresses.
[22:43:07] <pjb> It's an internal operator that has leaked for historical reasons.  You should not use it at all.
[22:43:37] <pjb> Only, some opeartors such as GET use it, so you have to know it and not use numbers or characters as indicators in plists.
[22:43:38] <tewi> oh yes, i don't think i will. but since the definition of EQL uses it, i figured i'd better learn how it works
[22:44:21] <pjb> of course.
