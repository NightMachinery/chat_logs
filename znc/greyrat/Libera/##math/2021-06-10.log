[00:29:31] <nejimban> err, no, sorry, say at random in {1, …, n^2}
[00:30:57] <buster> seems easy to describe (which makes me think i'm missing the point): for each n > 0, player n rolls an n-sided die. \cup E_n is "some player >=m rolls a 1". \cap\cup E_n is "an infinite number of players roll a 1".
[00:30:58] <nejimban> (if it is in {1, …, n} as I originally wrote, then the second part of BC tells you will have infinitely many correct guesses)
[00:31:02] <johnkeats6> but so if you used {1, ..., n} would the probability of guessing right infinitely often *not* be 0?
[00:31:22] <nejimban> it will be 1
[00:31:36] <johnkeats6> yeah, i guess you're right. that feels so counter-intuitive tho

[00:32:48] <nejimban> that sum(1/n) is divergent can be considered as counterintuitive too
[00:33:02] <nejimban> at least for zeno

[00:33:43] <nejimban> yes :d
[00:33:56] <johnkeats6> sum 1/n diverging *is* counter-intuitive. it implies you can stack books one on top of the other and get arbitrarily far to the right

[01:46:34] <johnkeats6> nejimban, yeah. i just read about a cool one too: you play a game where at stage n you lose 2^n dollars with probability 1/(2^n + 1), and win 1 dollar with probability 2^n/(2^n + 1). the expected value at each stage is 0, but the probability that you lose infinitely often is also 0 since sum 1/(2^n + 1) converges; so you'll almost surely make an infinite amount of money
[01:47:15] <nejimban> saint-petersburg paradox?
[01:47:38] <johnkeats6> i think it's not the same, but i don't recall now
[01:48:45] <nejimban> I like to state it this way: with probability ∊ you die, and with probability 1-∊ you win a certain amount M of dollars
[01:49:08] <nejimban> the expectation is always -∞ (if you consider that dying has value -∞…)
[01:49:53] <nejimban> but if ∊ is 10^-6 and M ≥ 100000$, I think I play
[01:51:32] <johnkeats6> yeah i mean realistically we're probably doing a bunch of stuff all the time that has a probability ~ 10^-6 of killing us and not even making 100 grand for it

[01:58:16] <johnkeats6> i'm not sure how much rationality you can get from bayes thm, because you could just choose astronomically high priors for whatever you want to believe, and then no amount of evidence in the world will convince you otherwise
[01:58:37] <bildramer> keep in mind expectation can go up while almost all trajectories go down

[02:03:46] <bildramer> three rounds goes back up to 50% gain 50% loss, but eventually it's 99.9%+ loss
[02:04:50] <bildramer> which means all the positive expectation comes from some very rare but very plentiful trajectories that will almost certainly not be realized

[02:08:20] <bildramer> 10^-4 might even be acceptable
[02:09:24] <bildramer> as for M, 100000 is life-changing, 70000 is a bit iffy, anything else and no risk is worth it
[02:10:27] <nejimban> hmm, yeah
[02:10:32] <bildramer> I don't think the elasticity/slope matters too much personally, the whole idea is "get basically infinite money for an unacceptable but low-probability risk"
[02:11:11] <bildramer> if the risk is too high, no go, and if the money doesn't let me live for half a century without working, also no go
[02:11:19] <johnkeats6> shouldn't you be willing to tolerate 0.5 * 10^-6 for 50 grand? :>

[02:22:00] <johnkeats6> in the end it's just genetics / random brain chemistry stuff making us more or less risk averse, i don't think it's any rational computation

[04:37:19] <bildramer> that easily gets you up to 1%, not rare if you play blackjack regularly

[04:38:01] <Matt|home> off the top of my head i remembered winning or losing more than 4 or 5 in a row to be fairly rare, but i don't know the numbers
[04:38:02] <bildramer> also the game is slightly strategic and involves your input, and that means you could consciously or unconsciously change your decisions in a way that makes sequential games more likely to have the same result

[04:39:43] <bildramer> a trick you can use here, because you specified both wins and losses, is just plot p^9 * (1-p)^4 and look at the maximum, which is what I did to get 0.032%

[04:40:48] <Matt|home> bildramer : i've got a slightly complex question regarding a game coming up, im not sure if it's worth calculating over
[04:40:49] <bildramer> or apply some thought and realize that loss probability p=9/(4+9) maximizes that
[04:41:28] <bildramer> go ahead and ask
[04:42:26] <Matt|home> there are these weekly "tournaments" (they're just drawings when you boil it down), players are given x money for 8 hands of blackjack and the top 20 or so get prizes. so, we're given 20,000 in chips to play with, min bet is 1k, and max is 20k i think. in all of the tournmanets i've played in, you generally need to end with a baseline minimum of 100,000 to not be eliminated. there's only 1 round of 8 hands so it's just that
[04:42:56] <Matt|home> is there some specific betting strategy to maximize chances of hitting that benchmark number or is that kind of strategy just minimally unimportant given the number of hands
[04:45:16] <bildramer> good question. -20000 or 0 are equally worthless to you, there's a line you most overcome for chip amount to matter at all, that makes risky strategies worth it
[04:45:18] <Matt|home> there's maybe 200 participants, ish total
[04:45:49] <bildramer> as for how the numbers work out unfortunately I don't know lol
[04:46:04] <Matt|home> no prob. im going to assume all hands have a 50/50 shot of success
[04:46:59] <bildramer> if there were infinite hands, you'd use the kelly criterion
[04:47:07] <bildramer> which is unintuitively high
[04:47:15] <Matt|home> so assume half losses half wins, then to hit 100k i'll do minimum bet for the first 4 hands, then just ramp up i guess the next 4. thats a """strategy""" right :D
[04:47:22] <bildramer> in this case there's early stopping which would make the optimal bet amount even higher
[04:48:01] <bildramer> however if your goal isn't to maximize amount but to be within the top N, that could lower it again

[05:19:02] <life> ask lol

[05:32:51] <bildramer> so still absurdly low
[05:34:51] <bildramer> I've been trying to parse "since thats 128 but 1 then 3 times so 4" for a while now
[05:34:56] <bildramer> I don't get it
[05:35:47] <Galois> buy a lottery ticket. Win the lottery. Repeat this process ONE HUNDRED TIMES IN A ROW.
[05:36:05] <Galois> clarification: win the grand prize in the lottery. Say, powerball.
[05:37:04] <bildramer> at some point our intuitions fail. quick, what's more unlikely, winning a lottery 5 times or beating rock-paper-scissors 400 times?
[05:37:47] <johnkeats6> depends on the lottery :p
[05:37:49] <Galois> ask them if there's even one person anywhere who has even won the powerball grand prize even twice in their lifetime (not necessarily in a row)
[05:38:08] <bildramer> it's almost certainly one being much more likely than the other
[05:38:34] <Galois> some intuitions remain sound. We have an intuition that winning powerball 100 times in a row is less likely than winning powerball twice in a lifetime.
[05:38:39] <bildramer> by my shitty approximation rps is way more likely
[05:39:26] <bildramer> yeah, but replace 100 with 97 and it's difficult to understand that that difference is still incredible
[05:40:14] <Galois> if even twice in one lifetime is incredible, then it doesn't take very strong intuition to understand that 100 times in a row is also incredible
[05:40:50] <bildramer> it's because we tend to automatically use the kind of heuristic that says "well that's sus, something must have caused X to happen 100 times reliably, so 3 less isn't that big of a deal"
[05:41:18] <bildramer> which would be a good heuristic irl, of course. someone wins the lottery 43 times, you know he'll win the next one, you also know it wasn't luck

[06:16:15] <johnkeats6> i guess it has to pullback measure 0 subsets of R to probability 0 events
[06:17:51] <frelleck> the probability of {x: X > a} has to be absolutely continuous
[06:18:08] <frelleck> the Radon-Nikodym derivative of that is then the pdf
[06:18:24] <frelleck> so things with jumps don't qualify
[06:18:37] <frelleck> i.e if P({x: x = a}) is ever positive
[06:19:16] <johnkeats6> is absolute continuity equivalent to the thing i said?
[06:20:10] <frelleck> I think so
[06:21:14] <frelleck> not sure if it's if and only if though
[06:21:26] <johnkeats6> probably, bc according to williams radon-nikodym says if mu(E) = 0 implies lambda(E) = 0 then dlambda/dmu = f
[06:23:08] <johnkeats6> so the pullback measure on R given by the rv X is a multiple of the lebesgue measure if (but i don't think only if) this rv pulls back measure 0 sets to prob 0 events
[06:24:12] <johnkeats6> wait, obviously it's only if right?

[14:59:11] <tempate> mh_le: well, for what I'm understanding T0, T1 and T2 talk mostly about open sets while T3 and T4 talk about closed sets. If I understand them correctly, T3 means that for every point contained in an open set there's a closed set that's contained in a different (null intersection) open set, and T4 means the same but replacing point with another closed set
[15:00:58] <mh_le> yeah

[15:07:40] <mh_le> which book did you use for th first part of the course?

[15:08:28] <tempate> I have the final exam in a few hours

[16:32:43] <Vornicus> Consider the game Memory: there are n symbols and 2n cards, placed face down; you turn over cards in pairs, keeping them turned if the pairs match and unturning them if the pairs do not match.  Question: given that you don't know the layout of the cards in the first place, how many unturns do you end up performing in the worst case for a memory game of n symbols?
[16:33:15] <Matt|home> PlanckWalk : you might be right. on average how consistently do you think i need to generate positive income before i can definitively say "im doing this on purpose" ? thousand hours?
[16:33:30] <Matt|home> maybe 10k
[16:34:26] <Matt|home> Vornicus : this is pretty basic statistical math, but the formula for determining blackjack likelihood is really complicated ;_; i wish there was an easy way to keep track of it that i know of

[16:42:18] <bildramer> Vornicus: clarify, "worst case" under which conditions? it can't be forgetting cards, because then you could pick the same non-matching pair indefinitely, but if you have perfect memory the game is trivial
[16:44:14] <bildramer> also how do you count unturns? worst case is you uncover all pairs except one, and the remaining pair is different symbols and you're aware of that
[16:44:20] <bildramer> (with perfect memory)
[16:44:22] <int-e> Vornicus: f(n) = n-1 I'd guess. The worst case being that after the first pair, you always uncover a card that belongs to a new pair, followed by a card that completes a pair you've already seen the other card of.
[16:44:46] <bildramer> so n-1 then either you uncover the pair to gather information directly or you try one of the cards with a known card and that counts as one-half maybe?

[16:51:43] <bildramer> rotate and scale?
[16:51:53] <lericson> just rotation
[16:51:56] <bildramer> because the distances from 0,0 to x,y and from 0,0 to x,0 aren't the same
[16:52:16] <lericson> oh well (x', 0) and (0, 0)
[16:52:29] <lericson> keeping the length equal
[16:52:36] <bildramer> then the angle is -atan2(y,x)
[16:52:55] <lericson> right, and the rotation matrix would be sines and cosines of that
[16:52:56] <bildramer> which is programmer speak for "atan(y/x) but keep track of the quadrants and don't make sign errors"
[16:53:01] <lericson> so i'm wondering if there is a better way to do it
[16:53:10] <lericson> i mean i'm 99% sure there is
[16:53:14] <Vornicus> ab cA (aA) dB (bB) eC (cC) (Dd) (Ee) okay that's 4, ab cA (aA) dB (bB) eC (cC) fD (dD) (Ee) (Ff) yeah this makes sense, it will be n-1
[16:53:15] <int-e> Vornicus: shouldn't be hard to prove either; it's obvious enough that an optimal strategy will always uncover a new card first, unless we've seen a complete pair that we can uncover. And we only fail if that new card belongs to a pair that we haven't seen before.
[16:53:43] <bildramer> well, in this particular case, cos is equivalent to x/sqrt(x^2+y^2) and sin to y/sqrt(x^2+y^2)
[16:54:10] <int-e> Vornicus: and since the first failure touches two pairs... and each following failure touches another pair, that's n-1 failures at most.

[16:57:00] <bildramer> I'll use different letters for clarity, that should end up transforming (u,v) into u' = sqrt(u^2+v^2), v' = 0
