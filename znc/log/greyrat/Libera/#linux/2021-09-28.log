[01:56:47] <TheGuestMovie> aloha. Does Linux (ideally Plasma) have a way to configure snap zones on a single monitor, like Windows 11 has? https://www.anoopcnair.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-255-1024x648.png
[01:56:53] <rascul> so if it finds files apple.mp4 cheese.mp4 and poo.mp4 it will run the command 'mpv apple.mp4 cheese.mp4 poo.mp4'

[05:00:58] <rascul> thinking just gets me in trouble and/or hurts
[05:01:03] <magicvoodoo> what's the ssh equivalent on Windows?
[05:01:23] <magicvoodoo> I know you can probably install ssh but... what happens?
[05:01:26] <rascul> can use ssh with cygwin or wsl
[05:01:30] <rustytaco> the print spooler? it doesnt even need passwords...wait they fixed that a while back...after 25 years
[05:01:32] <magicvoodoo> do you just run powershell commands in it?
[05:01:33] <azirino> But they say it is much more difficult to get anything installed on linux

[05:02:16] <rustytaco> Without anything even resembling authentication
[05:02:33] <magicvoodoo> the difficulty of installation is about the same on both flavors of OS
[05:02:39] <fiskfannine> i thought linux had really good package managers compared to windows or apple (although apple has homebrew)
[05:03:04] <magicvoodoo> you can use magic packages in a GUI in Linux etc, about the same experience
[05:03:12] <rascul> for anything in subscribed repos, installation tends to be easier on linux distros
[05:03:24] <magicvoodoo> Windows has choco which is surprisingly competent as a package manager
[05:03:25] <rascul> generally it's just a simple command
[05:03:31] <rustytaco> not having to use a mouse makes things much easier

[05:05:31] <magicvoodoo> I guess if you had enough command-line tools you could do something useful sshing to Windows
[05:06:01] <magicvoodoo> but the right answer is probably something like "run WSL inside Windows and just SSH to that"

[06:47:08] <nevoyu> jcbjoe2021, as many times as your hardware can handle it. Theoretically infinite software wise.

[06:47:20] <nevoyu> I've seen shell scripts with hundreds of pipes.
[06:47:56] <a1> my house has at least a hundred
[06:48:45] <extraor> lol, you think it would be more efficient/faster to write a program in some other language to handle that much manipulation
[06:48:51] <jcbjoe2021> So if I run this command find . -type f | sed -n 's/..*\.//p' | sort | uniq -c can I then do this find . -type f | sed -n 's/..*\.//p' | sort | uniq -c | du -shc {} +;
[06:49:32] <jcbjoe2021> Is that possible?
[06:50:12] <nevoyu> yes
[06:50:28] <jcbjoe2021> Cool
[06:50:48] <kfrench> jcbjoe2021: You'll find that you'll hit your own limits before you hit a pipe limit.
[06:50:52] <nevoyu> Really you input the result of the first command back into the next one. if all else fails you can find out the hard way

[09:36:57] <hexnewbie> There are also curious things like, I run ‘firefox -no-remote &’ to open a remote firefox on my X. Since I've been using x2go (2017? 2018?), the -no-remote thing is not needed, but it got retained in history. So in 2020, I didn't run firefox for a month, so now I just run ‘firefox &’.

[13:12:51] <wigums> f5 you can swapoff but i just dont make a swap partition so there is no swap to use
[13:13:07] <jacekowski> swappiness =1 is respected, but you probably have very high memory pressure
[13:13:22] <f5> in LM 19 the swap wasn't used excessively when vm.swapiness=1 was set in sysctl
[13:13:29] <djph> f5: okay ... so what're you running that's putting pressure on the RAM; and more importantly, how much RAM do you haave

[13:28:38] <jacekowski> f5: if you look at the code, setting it to 0 causes cost of anon pages to drop to 0 therefore cost of swapping will be significantly higher and kernel will never swap, unless there is no other option

[16:03:19] <kurahaupo> ldd shows the "planned" addresses where the module would have loaded without address randomisation; it's simply adding a fixed base to the internal offsets. With address randomisation a different base is chosen when creating each process.
[16:03:19] <kurahaupo> ld-linux.so is the "loader" for ordinary ELF programs

The kernel then loads that file, and then runs it. That then parses the more complex parts of the ELF file, including finding and loading its dependent shared libraries.

[17:17:17] <Minus_One> probably defjam, there is no official support and a handful of third party options. Last time I looked into it I also found rclone
[17:17:26] <NGC3982> it was some time for me since, now. but, id say rclone is at least the most explored.

[19:32:08] <bin> but one some of the work ones that i do not have control over sudo is used
[19:32:25] <MrElendig> there are a load of non-chromecast compatible ones too of course
[19:32:28] <bin> ive always done sudo su - but then recently was reading abotu sudo  -i  and was trying to figure otu if one is better than the other
[19:32:41] <bin> thx for the explainer ayecee
[19:32:54] <Psi-Jack> I don't think the THX sound system has much to do with this.
[19:33:00] <ayecee> bin: it's marginally better, if only for reducing the flak you get from experienced users ;)
[19:33:10] <bin> is sudo su something you should be disabling, and if so how
[19:33:21] <ayecee> no
[19:33:22] <bin> ayecee: sudo -i is marginally better
[19:33:25] <bin> or sudo su is?
[19:33:33] <ayecee> sudo -i is marginally better, yes
[19:33:33] <Psi-Jack> sudo -i  is better. Less forking.
[19:33:37] <bin> thats what i figured

[19:33:50] <simoneb> MrElendig: any protocol will do for me, as long as a regular Android mobile phone can recognize it as a streaming device... but afaik there isn't much choice... chromecast, miracast, ... that's about it I think
[19:33:52] <ayecee> :)
[19:33:52] * MrElendig wish google would open up chromecast, but they are doing the oposite instead
[19:33:59] <bin> it's just one of those things ive done blindly for years without thjinking about
[19:34:09] <ayecee> we all have at some point
[19:34:14] <MrElendig> simoneb: multiple miracast implementations, miraclecast is a somewhat popular one
[19:34:37] <ayecee> does android do miracast anymore?
[19:34:40] <bin> ill get into the habit of sudo -i. it looks cleaner too and idk i like the idea of fewer process forking
[19:34:41] <MrElendig> simoneb: and you can always stream sound from android to pulseaudio
[19:34:52] <simoneb> miraclecast seems interesting
[19:35:00] <defjam> wow that rclone works beautifully for mounting google drive
[19:35:13] <MrElendig> and then there is dlna

[21:49:45] <rasta> fiskfan1999 theoretically, that doesn't even matter... some exploits will not need user interaction at all, so if you are paranoid about it, you better don't use any of it
[21:49:56] <ayecee> fiskfan1999: in risk analysis you multiply the probability of an event by the cost of an event. the probability is low but the potential cost is high.
[21:49:58] <shalok> paulcarroty: with 1080p h264, firefox uses about 80% CPU and chrome uses about 40-50%.
[21:50:10] <fiskfan1999> yep, there are potential zero-day exploits, especially with javascript
[21:50:18] <ayecee> and also without javascript
[21:50:35] <shalok> paulcarroty: My expectation is that if everything is working properly CPU should be only a few percent.
[21:51:00] <Shanzem> Cant they just mtm hijack the https requests??
[21:51:02] <shalok> Much less than the 80% of firefox or even the 40-50% of chromium
[21:51:13] <Pexin> the vast majority of historical web exploits would not be possible if js wasn't treated as mandatory. most weren't _solely_ js, but js was most often a component

[23:42:48] <sumthing1980> I double click on the medium video window and after 1 sec it becomes fullscreen
[23:42:54] <sumthing1980> could it be javascript?
[23:43:02] <Penagwin> It could be
[23:43:02] <sumthing1980> it seems very close to 1 second exact
[23:43:05] <tar_xvf> probably yeah

[23:43:33] <lopid> maybe it's waiting to see if there's a third click
[23:43:44] <tar_xvf> the youtube site uses tons of javascript because they are so protective of the videos and don't want to you to be able to download them or anything, so it makes sense that it uses a ton of javascript to do anything
[23:43:54] <sumthing1980> do anyone of you use youtube and it becomes fullscreen instantly?
[23:43:57] <Penagwin> lopid This sounds very realistic
[23:44:12] <ayecee> sumthing1980: i don't think it's something i've ever noticed, whether it does or not.
[23:44:32] <tar_xvf> i use youtube and it freezes for a few tenths of a second when i double click on the video or hit the full screen button
[23:44:37] <Penagwin> sumthing1980 I'm on a mac, there's no delay for when it _starts_ fullscreening but there's a 1 second transition
[23:44:40] <rascul> i double click the medium video window and it takes maybe 1/2 second at most to make it fullscreen
