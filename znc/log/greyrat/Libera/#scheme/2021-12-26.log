[00:09:44] <Zipheir> Rhombus syntax looks like it falls somewhere between Python and C.  So, like virtually every other new mainstream language on the planet.
[00:16:13] <sham1> People sure like their ALGOL-esque syntax
[00:22:32] <sham1> And I'll be honest. As much as I like s-expressions, I can't blame language designers for it. Even if it is somewhat bland and the market is saturated
[00:22:57] <Zipheir> I like it fine, but more for imperative languages.  IMHO the f(x, y, z) notation is too heavy for languages based on composition.  But opinions on syntax should be taken with a grain of salt.
[00:23:30] <Zipheir> That's it, it seems bland.  No brilliant ideas for a clearer syntax, that I can see.
[00:24:51] <Zipheir> And, of course, it's going to be much harder to parse than good old S-expressions.
[00:26:45] <sham1> I mean, I'd frankly like some other modern language aside from Factor using RPN
[00:27:45] <sham1> Although then of course one gets the dilemma of how much Forth influence one would want
[00:32:28] <Zipheir> Joy is fun https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)
[00:33:48] <Zipheir> But if the Racket folks are worried that fully-parenthesized prefix notation is scaring people away, I can only imagine how they'd respond to an RPN concatenative approach.
[00:34:54] <sham1> Thatis true

[00:36:59] <amazigh> it is hit and miss, mostly miss tho
[00:37:08] <amazigh> hit or miss
[00:37:38] <amazigh> uxn is forth-like and it has a lot of users
[00:37:53] <amazigh> probably less than forth itself
[00:38:28] <drakonis> there's also a point regarding community interaction
[00:39:14] <amazigh> community is difficult. As far as I know, i sticked around other communities, as long as did not care too much about the community or the management
[00:40:42] <amazigh> uxn is great regarding community interaction, they have lore (or political agenda) that is embeded in the software, so people coming to uxn are ready to make the effort
[00:41:07] <amazigh> with lisp or scheme, there is no reason to make an effort for most people.
[00:43:42] <drakonis> racket's core team seems to be quite poor at interacting
[00:44:14] <amazigh> they are not the only ones that are poor at interaction ime

[01:37:33] <sham1> I'd honestly just do m-expressions if I wanted infix Lisp
[01:46:12] <Zipheir> And then there's the entire very successful ML family if you want full-on infix.
[01:46:36] <mdhughes> But the virtue here is it's already in Racket, everyone who uses Scribble uses it. So just wrapping your math in @{...} gets you 99% of the way with no changes.
[01:46:41] <Zipheir> A saturated market indeed.
[01:46:58] <Zipheir> Yeah, that's straightforward.
[01:47:32] <sham1> Although really what I'd like would be having a "normal" programming language that looked more like mathematics notation. Like yeah, that's already what infix kinda does, but it's still somewhat odd when compared with maths
[01:47:48] <mdhughes> There's definitely times when I'd like that in my code. I have some physics equation to type in, and prefix notation turns it into hairy fingernail clippings.
[01:48:15] <sham1> Yeah, going from "normal" infix mathematics notation to prefix notation can be very tricky
[01:48:47] <Zipheir> Too bad mathematical notation is so syntactically fishy.  ("Almost impressionistic", as Sussman said)
[01:49:11] <sham1> Well it's an organically grown system that grew over millenia
[01:49:23] <Zipheir> Yes, a natural language of sorts.
[01:49:24] <sham1> Of course it's going to be fishy in many ways
[01:50:30] <Zipheir> The semantics are even fishier :)  Hmm, df/dx, looks like a rational number, ok...
[01:50:48] <sham1> Of course, one weakness of trying to do programming in maths notation would be the way identifiers are
[01:50:57] <sham1> To get any meaningful names you'd need subscripts
[01:52:05] <Zipheir> x_1, x1, or x-1, I suppose.
[01:52:32] <Zipheir> I guess APL has gone furthest in that direction.
[01:53:14] <sham1> And of course, as much as we want to pretend that declarative programming, you know, declares stuff, it still at some level describes how to do computation while of course mathematics doesn't do that. One can't for example evaluate \sum_{i=0}^\infty 2^{-i} with a computer, you'd need a special rule to notice that the sum converges to 2
[01:53:50] <mdhughes> Why not x¹x²x³x⁴x⁵x⁶x⁷x⁸x⁹x¹⁰ 
[01:53:58] <sham1> Those are clearly exponents
[01:54:03] <sham1> That's why
[01:54:16] <Zipheir> Clearly the Right Thing is x₁, x₂, ...
[01:54:16] <mdhughes> x₁x₂x₃x₄x₅x₆x₇x₈x₉x₁₀ 
[01:54:21] <sham1> There you go
[01:54:57] <mdhughes> I have a program runes.py that generates all sorts of Unicode I can't type.
[01:55:06] <mdhughes> (for i in {1..10}; do echo -n "x{sub:$i}"|runes.py; done; echo)|pbcop
[01:55:08] <Zipheir> So we want a very very advanced Coq or Agda.
[01:55:45] <mdhughes> APL, really. Shit. We're always back to APL.
[01:58:56] *** Quits: TCZ (~tcz@91.150.178.124) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:59:27] <sham1> APL might indeed be one of the best alternative mathematics syntaxes that exist. Although it also abandons some usual stuff like operator precedence, instead of course evaluating right to left
[02:01:23] <sham1> It's very similar to Forth and the Lisps in that regard, that operators don't really have a precedence, but unlike the other two, it's infix
[02:10:07] <mdhughes> Also some versions of LOGO had infix, but I think not UCB, it's just prefix but all functions have fixed arity.
[02:27:19] <jcowan> Inevitably so

[20:08:29] <amazigh> +say
[20:09:09] <amazigh> rationale for the slowness: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2017-03/msg00147.html
[20:09:24] <amazigh> same thread
[20:10:21] <sham1> That's such an odd thing to do
[20:10:37] <sham1> I don't get why one would eval code like that
[20:12:21] <edgar-rft> there's always an even more idiotic way to do it :-)
[20:12:35] <sham1> Metacircular? Metacircular
[20:18:15] <amazigh> that is sad, because it is a very good app. A collegue was using it to copy some scores, he used a vm with an old ubuntu

[21:15:18] <amazigh> leah2: just discovered you blog is older than mine :p
[21:15:52] <leah2> heh
[21:16:00] <leah2> i should prune it at some point
[21:18:16] <amazigh> yet another academic!
[21:18:24] <leah2> dropout :p
[21:18:28] <amazigh> #scheme has more academic that google!
[21:18:45] <amazigh> I just read google has 16K PhDs!
[21:18:55] <amazigh> dropout? you can dropout a phd?
[21:18:55] <leah2> they used to hire phds only
[21:19:06] <leah2> amazigh: well, it kinda went bad
[21:19:09] <amazigh> hmm
[21:19:11] <amazigh> no worries
[21:19:13] <leah2> and then i ran out of funding
[21:19:17] <amazigh> oh bad
[21:19:27] <leah2> amazigh: like, my advisor died first
[21:19:35] <amazigh> wat!
[21:19:38] <leah2> and i made no progress really, so i decided to drop out
[21:19:43] <leah2> yeah, it was bad
[21:20:00] <amazigh> I know someone in machine learning took 10 years to deliver their thesis .
[21:20:16] <amazigh> 10 years is usually "reserved" for humanities
[21:20:20] <leah2> there's this rock star
[21:20:46] <leah2> Brian May earned a PhD degree in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007
[21:20:59] <leah2> age 60 :D
[21:21:05] <amazigh> ^^
[21:21:16] <amazigh> great
[21:21:34] <leah2> anyway. should i ever get a phd it will be on a different topic than back then :p
[21:23:10] <amazigh> what would be the new topic?
[21:23:23] <leah2> idk, something more PLT i guess
[21:23:31] <amazigh> hmm still CS tho
[21:23:32] <leah2> old topic was higher order model checking
[21:23:39] <leah2> well yeah, i cant do anything else :D
[21:23:49] <amazigh> hm.. same
[21:24:18] <amazigh> for work I wen through two or three humanities PhD. NONE of them was less than 700pp
[21:24:43] <leah2> i read some phd theses that were published as proper books
[21:24:47] <leah2> similar range yeah
[21:24:50] <amazigh> my master thesis was such a joke not even 30pp
[21:24:59] <leah2> but good biographies :)
[21:25:08] <amazigh> full of spelling mistakes et al.
[21:26:21] <amazigh> I but it has not a "research master thesis" and other people thesis were also... subpar according to my current standards.
[21:27:03] <amazigh> my master thesis has a github link for random github project :p
[21:27:11] <leah2> mine wasnt very good but the scope is ok i think
[21:27:25] <leah2> still got straight A's :p
[21:27:34] <amazigh> ahah
[21:27:43] <amazigh> bravo!
[21:29:21] <leah2> kinda wanna do more math but it's hard to stay motivated alone. the course system at uni helped a lot
[21:32:59] <amazigh> leah2: how does it happen that you know Scheme so well?
[21:33:49] <leah2> when i was a kid i went to the library and read every CS book they had
[21:33:54] <leah2> (which were like 100)
[21:34:01] <leah2> and there was one on CL and one on Scheme
[21:34:06] <amazigh> wow!
[21:34:11] <amazigh> in germany? which town?
[21:34:12] <leah2> and, well, implementations were available in debian, so
[21:34:17] <leah2> biberach, small town
[21:34:30] <leah2> i still have that book i think
[21:34:43] <amazigh> well... not the kind of books I read at the library... I read a book about the invention of the Internet if that counts :|
[21:35:42] <leah2> https://www.worldcat.org/title/wie-man-in-lisp-programmiert-eine-einfuhrung-anhand-von-pc-scheme-30/oclc/75065053
[21:35:45] <rudybot> https://teensy.info/gpYB5a5bsg
[21:35:51] <leah2> later i read SICP
[21:35:56] <amazigh> at what age?
[21:36:06] <leah2> but i mostly used elisp :p
[21:36:24] <amazigh> before or after 18?
[21:36:27] <leah2> i found scheme code from 2002, i was 15 at that time
[21:36:42] <leah2> the CL book was winston/horn, that one was better :p
[21:36:52] <amazigh> wow! in 2002 I was programming with php3 and vb :/ 
[21:37:16] <leah2> i did some vb earlier, php never really
[21:37:27] <leah2> learned ruby in 2001
[21:37:29] <amazigh> did you knew someone around you that knew unix / linux or programming?
[21:37:44] <leah2> my dad taught me a bit qbasic and pascal (his fav)
[21:37:54] <leah2> and a friend of his gave me debian cds :D
[21:37:56] <amazigh> so did my father
[21:38:09] <amazigh> mandrake on my side :/
[21:38:13] <leah2> but mostly self-educated
[21:38:17] <amazigh> me too
[21:38:23] <leah2> they just kickstarted everything a bit
[21:38:29] <amazigh> they?
[21:38:35] <leah2> these two people
[21:38:46] <amazigh> ah you mean, they ignited the self-education 
[21:38:47] <leah2> the friend also gave me a german translation of the texbook
[21:38:49] <leah2> yes
[21:39:21] <leah2> but i'm pretty sure i used tex in 4th grade so that must have been earlier :D
[21:39:25] <amazigh> I did not spend a lot of time with mandrake, later I discovered gentoo, that I used to 10 years until ubuntu became a thing
[21:39:49] <amazigh> 5 years or so in fact.
[21:41:07] <Zipheir> Wow, Mandrake.  That was ... Mandriva? by the time I started with Linux distros.
[21:41:24] <amazigh> What is your first computer? and do you have a favorite video game?
[21:41:31] <amazigh> Zipheir: yes.
[21:41:49] <amazigh> it was a fork of redhat iirc
[21:42:05] <leah2> amazigh: first computer i used some 386, first i owned a pentium 90
[21:42:10] <amazigh> the author is still active, they work on /e/ a android alternative
[21:42:18] <leah2> video game, not sure. most i played is path of exile
[21:43:52] <amazigh> my ex gf told my cursed by my favorite book (foundation) and my favorite game (civilization)
[21:44:41] <leah2> haha
[21:44:44] <amazigh> I do not know what came first a) my addiction to anticipation b) or reading a lot of anticipation stuff
[21:45:05] <amazigh> anticipation is a word of scifi in french, not sure it translates to english
[21:46:05] <Zipheir> Good term.  I don't think there's a strict counterpart in English, except "speculative fiction", which is pretty verbose.
[21:46:20] <amazigh> most of my high-school years we waster because I always was dreaming about what would come next
[21:47:25] <amazigh> changing subject a little bit: what is the goal of a PhD?
[21:47:56] <Zipheir> The goal of J. Random PhD, or the goal in getting a PhD?
[21:47:59] <amazigh> I read a couple of PhD, but I do not understand the gist of the idea, I went through some educational material both on wikipedia, and french universities, but it does not tick
[21:48:11] <amazigh> what is J. Random PhD?
[21:48:15] <Zipheir> Some guy.
[21:48:58] <Zipheir> http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/J/J--Random.html
[21:48:59] <amazigh> no not some random PhD, but the journey toward the thesis, and what the jury expect from quality work
[21:51:18] <leah2> i guess it should be proof you can do independent academic work
[21:51:38] <amazigh> I used to think that it was "to make a discovery" but it is not the case.
[21:51:40] <Zipheir> Talk of goals in academia is kind of thin, IME.  I suppose "quality work" means "something significant to the discipline and "original"".
[21:53:02] <sham1> Well it doesn't need to be original, as long as it drives the disipline forward somehow
[21:53:27] <amazigh> original maybe in the sense not plagiarism of some sort
[21:53:55] <Zipheir> I immediately remember Larry McEnerney's lecture on effective writing: Sure, originality is good, but first: your work must be valuable!

[21:56:46] <amazigh> today I tested github actions to run racket's chez fork aka. arew on github actions, the armv6 run is read, and it run 6 times slower than the x86-64
[21:57:12] <amazigh> excellent video mentioned by Zipheir 
[21:58:38] <amazigh> also I investigated how build.sr.ht works (btw the code is far from perfect...)
[21:59:15] <amazigh> they interweave go, shell, and python, and setting the whole thing is far from trivial
[21:59:37] <amazigh> reminds me of the colloquial saying "once it works, do not touch"
[22:01:08] <Zipheir> Wow, sounds complex.
[22:01:24] <Zipheir> Glue, glue, glue.

[22:12:40] <Zipheir> Has anyone started HTMLizing R7RS-small?  I was thinking recently that that would be a good thing to have done by the end of 2022.
[22:13:22] <amazigh> I failed to do it software I could find. yet it would a be good thing.
[22:13:54] <amazigh> I think it requires adjustments in the latex source, but idk latex well enough
[22:14:01] <amazigh> or at all
[22:14:54] <Zipheir> I don't think it would be *too* much work.
[22:15:21] <Zipheir> We'd just need a place to host it.

[22:15:55] <Zipheir> Copy of what?
[22:15:59] <sham1> The spec
[22:16:10] <Zipheir> The PDF and LaTeX, yes.
[22:16:20] <Zipheir> https://github.com/johnwcowan/r7rs-spec/tree/errata/spec
[22:16:45] <Zipheir> r7rs.org just redirects to https://github.com/johnwcowan/r7rs-spec ATM.
[22:17:07] <Zipheir> It would be nice to have something like r6rs.org for that.
[22:18:30] <amazigh> I want to help, and I need some guidance.
[22:19:56] <Zipheir> r6rs.org has very simple HTML, no frames or fancy styles, for the most part.  I'd say it's a good model.
[22:20:13] <amazigh> I just made a coffee, so now is the good time :>
[22:20:45] <Zipheir> Hah, of course.
[22:22:05] <Zipheir> Is there a good tool for converting LaTeX to basic HTML?  Something to start with.
