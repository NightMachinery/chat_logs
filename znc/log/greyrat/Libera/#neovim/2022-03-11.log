[00:28:20] <dundargoc> kenaryn: I'm not saying "don't learn lua", but if you feel like there's too much to take in then take it slow. Vim/neovim is big and it takes time to learn everything (if that's even possible :) ).
[00:28:48] <dundargoc> I'd say start with the user manuals if you haven't already, they build a great foundation.
[00:28:51] <ArshiaAghaei[m]> So the best place to learn neovim would be the doc inside neovim?
[00:28:59] <dundargoc> I think so, yes.

[03:38:44] <kchibisov> It's kind of surprising that it's not mentioned that h,j,k,l instead of arrows is due to keyboard of Vi author having arrow keys on those keys.

[03:44:02] <kchibisov> I mean you don't ever move anything if you shift them one button to right.
[03:44:10] <sunjonSenghanBri> more relevant to the authors keyboard, is that the default keys are very much tailored to a US layout
[03:45:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> kchibisov:libera.chat: you change your hand position, and you change the fingers you use for the two most used keys (up/down) to weaker fingers
[03:45:55] <kchibisov> I mean you don't change hand position, your fingers are already on j,k,l,;
[03:46:32] <sunjonSenghanBri> ah yeah, I'm half-paying attention. You're right there
[03:47:14] <kchibisov> And you press `shift + ;` anyway to type commands, so you kind of used to it.

[19:32:18] <bigGopher> seems like I'm trying to use tabs wrong according to the first answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/102384/using-vims-tabs-like-buffers
[19:32:51] <bigGopher> I'm trying to opena new tab when jumping to definition with gd, but what I want might be to keep all buffers visible to navigate between them with the left/right arrows
[19:32:59] <gpanders> Don’t worry about “wrong” or “right”, whatever works for you and helps you be productive is “right”
[19:33:22] <bigGopher> gpanders I agree, but the current tab behaviour doesnt really work for me very well
[19:33:51] <gpanders> That said, there certainly is a “happy path” for tabs/buffers, they were designed to be used in a certain way (as that SO post alludes to)
[19:34:00] <bigGopher> eg. when I set gd to open a new tab it works the first time I jump to it, but the second time it opens an horizontal split

[19:36:27] <nova> bigGopher: I started w vim so very used to its paradigms but can see how one would get used to tab<-buffer paradigm. Also, how do you open new tab? :tab sbuffer will open current buf in new tab and preseve cursor position (even if 'startofline' is v:true)
[19:38:42] <bigGopher> nova I'm trying to set the navigation in an easy way to visit the relevant files I'm working with. My plan was to setup the vim-go mapping '<Plug>(go-def-tab)<CR>' to 'gd' and I did, but the open tab behaviour is kind of weird. It opens a tab the first jump, but it opens an horizontal split if I have to jump again to the same definition
[19:39:15] <bigGopher> I tried to set different values for switchbuf but doesnt work as I would expect
[19:39:57] <bigGopher> I could get used to move between buffers I guess, but I would like to keep them visible maybe so I dont get disoriented of "where I am"
[19:41:06] <bigGopher> jumping back and forth between more than 2 or 3 files seems hard in vim/neovim without a visual indication
[19:42:48] <nova> for what it's worth, I like using tmux and each tmux page has one vim session, each vim session has a collection of buffers relevant to that task (:set laststatus=2 to always see statusline, which you can customize but by default shows the name - also CTRL-G shows info about file attached to current buffer). Then you can use :b {partial-name}<tab> :b <c-d> (CTRL-D) to see everything or :ls first
[19:45:28] <dundargoc> Yo dawg...
[19:47:06] <dundargoc>  * Sounds complicated :)
[19:48:11] <bigGopher> maybe a split with the list of open buffers and mapping left/right to prev or next buffer will work for me
[19:48:30] <haolian9[m]> how can i get the number of lines of a buffer? i am about to get it via counting `vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines()`, but wondering if there is a better way.
[19:49:29] <bigGopher> I dont really use tmux much, not sure if I want to introduce another tool into my workflow
[19:49:30] <nova> for those unfamiliar, the vim "paradigm" is: a 'window' is a window to a 'buffer' (thus, each window is tied to a buffer); each 'tabpage' has a collection of windows; each buffer can be associated with a file (via :file or :write <name>) so when you :write it knows where to write the buffer.

[21:15:49] <mrchu001[m]> has this issue been addressed somewhere already? I've only seen this [reference](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/17658#issuecomment-1064227493) so far
[21:16:00] <clason[m]> it's not an issue, though
[21:16:58] <mrchu001[m]> Sure sure, but I'm still unable to figure out why I can't build
[21:16:58] <clason[m]> make sure you build against libvterm 0.1.4, not 0.2 or whatever your distro provides
[21:17:00] <xiretza[m]> mrchu001[m]: is that in any way related?
[21:17:13] <xiretza[m]> oh wait, the comment is
[21:17:23] <mrchu001[m]> yeah the comment, sorry not the PR itself
[21:17:53] <clason[m]> neither the issue nor the comment looks related
[21:18:11] <xiretza[m]> well, the comment mentions it in passing
[21:18:18] <mrchu001[m]> ☝️
[21:18:30] <mrchu001[m]> I'll make sure libvterm is the right version
[21:18:45] <clason[m]> sorry, I don't see at all where that comment mentions libvterm.
[21:19:08] <xiretza[m]> > I remember seeing other build failure threads before relating to TS->val_string errors
[21:20:26] <mrchu001[m]> clason[m]: If you actually read the error message and the comment, you'll see how the comment mentions the error message I am seeing. It does not mention libvterm, that's right.

[21:21:59] <clason[m]> I am well aware of the issue, but the OP has a different error message, and the comment you linked to does not mention any error at all
[21:22:05] <clason[m]> maybe you meant to link to a different issue/comment?
[21:23:46] *** Joins: easyriders (~easyrider@xb9b5df82.cust.hiper.dk)
[21:24:05] <mrchu001[m]> 😒 in any case, I appreciate the tip on libvterm. Brew installed 0.2 so I will go down that path and try downgrading to 0.1.4
[21:25:08] <clason[m]> yeah. the homebrew formula is patched to build against the correct version; if it doesn't for you, there must be something weird going on (stale files?)
[21:25:44] <clason[m]> there may be an issue where the build scripts pick up system libraries over the bundled ones (which are incompatible in this case)
[21:26:08] <clason[m]> make sure `libvterm` is not installed via brew (or unlink it if it is) 
[21:32:11] <mrchu001[m]> makes sense
[21:32:15] <mrchu001[m]> unlinking libvterm from brew was the trick
[21:32:21] <mrchu001[m]> Thank you 🙏
[21:36:43] <mrchu001[m]> Now if only i can figure out why LSP is acting up now hehe

[23:21:03] <britcod[m]> recently i am trying to utilize neovim's diagnostic api, but i found some essential plugin were no licensed. how do you deal with that situation?

[23:26:07] <mizlan[m]> i install the plugin and i use it
[23:26:07] <xiretza[m]> open an issue kindly asking the maintainer to consider publishing it under a FOSS license, and don't touch it until that's happened
