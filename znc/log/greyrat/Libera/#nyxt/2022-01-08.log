[06:11:15] <mariari> got my first crahs!
[06:11:25] <mariari> Unhandled CL+SSL::SSL-ERROR in thread #<SB-THREAD:THREAD "Prompter update thread" RUNNING

[06:11:29] <mariari>   Condition CL+SSL::SSL-ERROR was signalled.
[06:11:43] <mariari> do you know if a crash of this kind has been reported
[06:11:50] <mariari> has an actually useful backtrace for ocne
[06:12:27] <mariari> https://ghostbin.lain.la/paste/wzbqg
[06:17:48] <waleee> that one was new I think
[06:18:21] <mariari> yeah seems so?
[06:18:31] <mariari> good news is, it took all day to crash
[06:19:59] <waleee> the cacert.pem file is there that dexador dir?
[06:20:25] <waleee> *there in that
[06:20:32] <mariari> let me check
[06:20:58] <mariari> I do see a cacert there
[06:21:10] <mariari> https://pomf2.lain.la/f/b2ztr69t.png
[06:21:26] <mariari> it's on my main disk so wasn't a read timeout
[06:21:35] <mariari> I am floating high ram before nyxts crash
[06:23:52] <waleee> https://github.com/cl-plus-ssl/cl-plus-ssl/blob/fd84c5ff791fe0faf4dc810e3e59467e38a5095c/src/context.lisp#L26 hm weird point to crash in
[06:24:37] <waleee> mariari: almost no ram left?
[06:24:40] <mariari> indeed the file is there
[06:24:42] <mariari> no I have plenty
[06:24:48] <mariari> just was floating around 40 gig
[06:24:54] <mariari> seem down to 24 gig
[06:25:05] <mariari> I think 8 of those gigs was nyxt?
[06:25:10] <mariari> restarted some other things
[06:25:40] <mariari> but yeah tha tcl+ssl::ssl-ctx-load-verify-locations should work here
[06:25:52] <mariari> it probably gets run often
[06:26:00] <mariari> this was during a quick prompt load
[06:26:07] <mariari> where I simply did C-x b !nh<crash>
[06:26:22] <mariari> you know what, does this lock the file at all? maybe it was being locked while read
[06:28:27] <waleee> I remember seeing some commits that added locks for some things
[06:29:09] <mariari> probably not it, but it is a weird place to die on
[06:29:13] <mariari> and the only crash of nyxt today
[06:29:18] <mariari> which is a good accomplishment

[18:38:13] <Jing> Maybe a silly question, but is static typing supported via serapeum's "->" in the code?

[18:44:20] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[18:47:10] <lagash> Jing: static being...? compile-time?
[18:48:09] <Jing> Yeah I suppose? Like some tools that "make" Python "static" so that it could run faster
[18:51:55] <lagash> Cl != Python, I'm not sure what you're getting at... typing would just make the code more correct, not necessarily faster..
[18:52:41] <lagash> IIRC the whole declaim stuff is undefined, but since pretty much everyone here uses SBCL..
[18:59:26] <lagash> I'm no CL expert though..
[19:00:32] <Jing> Thanks. It's still helpful. I was just reading some post that mentions they used static type constraints for Python, and then their production codes run faster
[19:50:44] <jmercouris> Jing: it is effectively pseudo static typing
[19:50:58] <jmercouris> It’s just a different syntax than the declaim one
[19:51:06] <jmercouris> It’s a little easier to write
[19:57:54] <mariari> declaim does speedup code, try writing CL code over (speed 3), it'll mention quite a bit paying extra for arithmetic due to not knowing they are fixnums
[19:58:21] <mariari> there is a limit however on how much tying you can get with CL base type system however, which is a bit sad

[22:14:02] <lagash> So, I finally sucked it up and got Demeter...
[22:25:14] <lagash> Unfortunately it doesn't work at all.
[22:36:24] <lagash> Error on GTK thread: When attempting to set the slot's value to :LOADING (SETF of SLOT-VALUE), the slot NYXT::STATUS is missing from the object

[22:37:54] <lagash> This is with the 0.1.0 release - speaking of, how would I update the source? `git remote show origin` says repository not found
[22:47:09] <drakonis> shouldn't the raedme be updated to reflect that nyxt is no longer just a browser?

[23:01:32] <aartaka> lagash: *it = Demeter
[23:04:55] <aartaka> lagash: which version are you on, in other words? Demeter is 2.*-only, afaik. The master is already too far into the 3.* lands to be compatible. I'm not sure, though. jmercouris might know it better :)
[23:27:18] <lagash> aartaka: which Nyxt version you mean? master, as per usual
[23:28:09] * aartaka feels so restricted needing to run 2.* Nyxt after having the forbidden fruit of the most recent features on master.
[23:29:22] <aartaka> lagash: Hm. Can you try with 2.2.3? I'm pretty sure it's nyxt: URLs that have broken something in Demeter...
[23:29:57] <aartaka> Hopefully that resolves the issue.
