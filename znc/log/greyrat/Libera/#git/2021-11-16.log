[02:08:55] <OnlineCop> On git v2.33.1, I have an untracked file named `.env.local`, which has not been added to a .gitignore file. I stashed it via `git stash push --include-untracked -m 'Add .env.local to run from CLI'`. I can see the stash message with `git stash list`, but `git show stash show stash@{0}`, the result is blank.
[02:09:47] <ZacSharp> stashes combined with show behave a it unintuitive
[02:10:01] <OnlineCop> Sorry: `git stash show ...` not `git show stash show ...`
[02:10:11] <OnlineCop> If I first add that file to the index and `git stash push -m 'Add .env.local to run from CLI'`, then I can see the stash message as well as the contents when I use `git stash show stash@{0}`.
[02:10:21] <ZacSharp> they are actually two commits while stash@{0} only refers to the second one
[02:11:01] <ZacSharp> yes, because stash creates two commits, one for the worktree and one for the index

[02:11:39] <OnlineCop> Is there a way to see that this `.env.local` file exists within the `--include-untracked` stash?
[02:12:30] <ZacSharp> A stash entry is represented as a commit whose tree records the state of the working directory, and its first parent is the commit at HEAD when the entry was created. The tree of
[02:12:31] <ZacSharp>        the second parent records the state of the index when the entry is made, and it is made a child of the HEAD commit.
[02:12:35] <ZacSharp> from man git stash

[02:14:06] <OnlineCop> `stash@{0}^1` and `stash@{0}^2` both return "fatal: 'stash@{0}^2' is not a stash-like commit"

[16:14:10] <bn_work> hi, git 2.24.3, why is it when one does `git blame foo`, I get entries like `00000000 (Not Committed Yet <timestamp_of_when_you_ran_cmd> ...`?, ie:  re-running it increments timestamp_of_when_you_ran_cmd ??

[20:35:03] <sqz1> hm any idea for a flatfile database-in-a-repo strategy (`db.json`) which, changes once deployed to a server? would be awesome to not put it in `.gitignore` but somehow always the last backup in the repo...perhaps: `git stash` in a pre-pull hook, and `git apply && git add db.json && git commit -m "db backup" && git push origin main` in a post-hook?
[20:35:51] <sqz1> @lpapp it really depends on what kind of validation you want, I guess lots of examples float around on the interwebs? (google) ?
[20:36:37] <mackerman> sqz1: If the changes on the server don't get commited, doesn't seem like a good canidate to track ina git repo.

[20:54:44] <aruns> I am running Git 2.17.1 on Ubuntu 18.0.4.4 LTS. When I run `git submodule status` on one of the repos I am working on, I get "fatal: no submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path *REDACTED_PATH_GOES_HERE*".  This nested submodule seems to have been tracked (it's contained within a WordPress plugin) on the repo. Is it possible within .git/config to ignore this submodule so my git submodule commands can
[20:54:50] <aruns> start working again?
