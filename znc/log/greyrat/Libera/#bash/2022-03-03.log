[00:54:03] <OnlineCop> If I wanted to use the system-installed bash (like version 3.x), would I use shebang `#! /bin/bash`, and if I wanted whatever the latest version `brew` or something installed, I would then use `#! /usr/bin/env bash` ?

[00:58:14] <OnlineCop> "My" operating system, or the container's OS?
[00:58:46] <OnlineCop> My host OS has a fairly recent (not bleeding-edge) bash version, but I've hit a few containers that don't have bash installed at all.
[00:58:52] <greycat> OpenBSD for example doesn't include bash in its base system at all.  It's available as a "package" (an optional add-on), and if you install that, it'll be in /usr/local/bin.
[00:58:54] <emanuele6> what do containers have to do with this, you were talking about your os
[00:59:21] <emanuele6> ( in your first question )
[00:59:23] <OnlineCop> Yeah; some of them were under /usr/bin/bash as well if I recall, so changing that script can be annoying when we use a different image for dev vs. prod.
[00:59:35] <greycat> So there is no single right answer.  You have to pick the solution that works for your situation.
[01:00:10] <OnlineCop> emanuele6: The second question was hoping to clarify the first question (this is all to do with docker images, not my host OS).
[01:00:31] <emanuele6> what is the question then?
[01:00:53] <greycat> I assume it's "what shebang do I use".
[01:01:18] <emanuele6> bash could be installed anywhere and the shebang should have the path to the bash executable
[01:01:24] <OnlineCop> Right: `#! /path/to/env bash` or `#! /path/to/bash`
[01:02:22] <emanuele6> that delegates the the execution of bash to the env program, that will use the first bash executable it finds in the $PATH directories

[01:05:29] <capn> when I run `diceware | tee >(mkpasswd -s)`, it works as expected with the cleartext password followed by the hash.
[01:05:36] <capn> however, if I run `echo "testing" | tee >(mkpasswd -s)` or other commands piped to tee, the hashed password appears after the next prompt and I have to press enter or ctrl+c to reset it.
[01:05:45] <capn> Any idea why?
[01:05:58] <emanuele6> if the directory in which your "brew" bash is installed comes before /bin in PATH (e.g. PATH=/usr/local/brew/bin:/bin, or however it is called), `env' will use /usr/local/brew/bin/bash; otherwise, if the first directory of PATH is /bin, `env bash' will run /bin/bash

[01:07:09] <djph> huh?
[01:07:15] <greycat> tkonto: { foo; echo; } > file

[01:07:47] <emanuele6> i also understood it like greycat, but i am not sure that is the correct interpretation
[01:08:08] <Friithian> so you have an output from a chain of commands that you want output to a file with an extra newline on the end?

[02:13:37] <atrus> larryv: "There is really no way to avoid this alteration of the output order." -- so, no possible solution to this, if i'm reading that right?
[02:13:38] <k8yun> The first line in the wiki answers my question actaully: `myscript >log 2>&1`
[02:13:41] <larryv> atrus: the variable and the subshell are red herrings. i observe the same behavior by just running /usr/bin/true

[05:00:25] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105

[05:01:40] <userT> Ok, thanks everyone.

[05:03:21] <userT> larryv: problem is, if just using plainly curl and grep, I get a *big* line like this: "loremipsumxyz<>%&/[...]https://desiredfreakinglink<>???more_nonsense"
[05:03:27] *** Quits: drbeco (~beco@user/beco) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:03:37] <larryv> alesan: that is not quite accurate. read reads the file fine
[05:03:41] <larryv> it just exits with a nonzero status

[05:05:25] <alesan> yeah but I have a check after the read, I was using it to see if read was able to find the file, open it, actually read it (permissions etc)
[05:05:41] <alesan> however now it returns non zero so I need to discriminate more

[05:08:01] <userT> Because it's matching greedy mode
[05:08:04] <OnlineCop> userT: Is there no way you could use a negated character class to know when you've reached some characters you won't find in a URL?

[05:09:12] <shbot> emanuele6: error
[05:09:58] <emanuele6> instead of using the exit code of read (which is not what you want to do), use the exist code of the open (which is what you want to do.)
[05:10:13] <wiscii> alesan: you must account for the EOF error which read gives

[05:15:50] <emanuele6> why does EOF matter?
[05:17:56] <emanuele6> alesan said that they want to read a file that only has one unterminated line and wants to check if the file fails to open
[05:18:15] <emanuele6> in bash, you can just do    if x=$(< file); then x; else y; fi
[05:18:27] <wiscii> The read builtin will indicate success unless EOF
[05:18:28] <emanuele6> in POSIX, you either do the same with x=$(cat file)
[05:18:29] <wiscii>             is encountered on input,
[05:18:58] <emanuele6> or you use   if { IFS= read -r hi; true ;} < file; then x; else y; fi   as i showed above
[05:19:09] <emanuele6> wiscii: why does it matter?
[05:19:13] <emanuele6> it clearly does not
[05:19:46] <Martin> alesan: you can avoid using "cut" with any "sha${n}sum" simply by going « sha256sum < "$filename" » rather than « sha256sum -- "$filename" »
[05:20:18] <emanuele6> Martin: that is not false
[05:20:33] <emanuele6> sha256sum would simply use - as the filename.
[05:20:55] <emanuele6> s/is not false/IS false/
[05:21:10] <quesker> does posix shell have path hashing?  I am playing with PATH in a script and getting strange results
[05:22:07] <emanuele6> it does.

[05:42:04] <Martin> emanuele6: The systems that have /usr/bin/bash "rather than" /bin/bash also mostly have /bin as a symlink to /usr/bin (mainly to provide /bin/sh for standard sh scripts), so in effect those systems have both /bin/bash and /usr/bin/bash.
[05:42:05] <Martin> Using #!/usr/bin/env has advantages and drawbacks, but the latter receive almost no consideration because they're second-order effects that almost never affect the person who writes the script.

[05:56:18] <emanuele6> why are you telling me this?
[05:56:28] <OnlineCop> I'm just content in using `#! env bash`
[05:56:57] <OnlineCop> I'll let PATH order sort it all out.

[05:58:11] <phy1729> don't worry they run the script with  sh ./foo
[05:58:14] <Martin> OnlineCop: That assumes that the same version of bash is suitable for all the scripts you run. That is probably true for you, but may not be for other people who receive such scripts.
[05:58:35] <emanuele6> that doesn't assume anything because IT DOES NOT WORK

[12:43:29] <lovetruth> so... the thing is that I didn't find any help in using getopts, but for cleaning the arguments list $@ out of "improper arguments" (or "non-arguments parameters")
[12:43:46] <lovetruth> like here https://medium.com/@codebyamir/parse-command-line-arguments-using-getopt-24a90b5b317d
[12:44:03] <lovetruth> they just seem to clean the list of arguments

[12:44:08] <Soliton> !getopt
[12:44:09] <greybot> The external command getopt(1) is never safe to use, unless you *know* it is GNU getopt, you call it in a GNU-specific way, *and* you ensure that GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is not in the environment. Use getopts (shell builtin) instead, or simply loop over the positional parameters.

[14:05:04] <pj> That is assuming that your file has just one ExecStart line, like mine.
[14:05:34] <sultand> ok ty
[14:05:58] <pj> oh, hang on
[14:06:34] <sultand> sed: -e expression #1, char 29: unknown option to `s'

[14:07:54] <sultand> that worked great. Thanks just had to add -i btw :)
[14:08:11] <pj> ahhh, yep
[14:09:04] <pj> oh, my client donked the %I from that, btw
[14:09:14] <pj> you probably want to add that in.
[14:09:40] <pj> my IRC client interpreted it as a color code and didn't pass it through.
[14:14:44] <sultand> just saw that thanks.
[14:14:44] <sultand> Btw when i try to do it the other way around.
[14:14:45] <sultand> sed -i 's|^ExecStart=.*|ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -o '-p -- \\u' --noclear %I $TERM|' /lib/systemd/system/getty@.service
[14:14:45] <sultand> Then i get this error: sed: -e expression #1, char 45: unterminated `s' command
[14:16:06] <gnoo> use "s|...\$TERM|"
[14:16:43] <sultand> guess it is because of the  '-p -- \\u'
[14:17:39] <geirha> just dump a complete .service file in there, don't try to do microedits on whatever is the default config

[14:18:32] <Soliton> but blind editing is so much more exciting, who knows what's going to result!
[14:19:15] <Earnestly> sultand: systemctl edit --full foo.service
[14:20:48] <furrymcgee> you could use patch instead of sed
[14:21:00] <Earnestly> Or create /etc/systemd/system/foo.service.d and into it place a file containing [Service] \n ExecStart= \n Execstart=changes here

[14:22:35] <Earnestly> Why not do the right thing first?
[14:23:13] <sultand> because this way is way faster and now i already have the commands. Dont want to waste time on trying another way if this works
[14:23:36] <Earnestly> I see
[14:24:59] <geirha> works great until it doesn't
[14:25:53] <jelly> manually editing a file in /lib, managed by package manager, may have unfortunate consequences down the line (like, next time the package is updated)
[14:26:35] <Soliton> just run sed from cron every minute, easy.
[14:27:47] <jelly> I believe the next thing one usually does to "fix" it is chattr +i, what can possibly go wrong
[14:29:02] <Soliton> but you're doing the blind edit because you know your edit will make sense with every new version. it's just that good.
[14:30:00] <Earnestly> The lesson to learn here is to not waste time
[14:30:08] <jelly> (it took me like 2 days to figure out the syntax to reset ExecStart= like Earnest'ly has shown, and only a trip to #systemd helped because documentation is horrible.  But it's possible and it's the right way)

[17:13:27] <Masklin__Gurder> Very good.
[17:13:31] <j0hn_mc_clane> the variable itself is just a "string" mapping
[17:13:33] <j0hn_mc_clane> nothing else
[17:13:51] <Masklin__Gurder> Yeah I know that so the answer I suppose depends on what is parsing it
[17:13:56] <j0hn_mc_clane> yes
[17:14:06] <j0hn_mc_clane> but generally it would crawl to the ln -s

[17:16:26] <j0hn_mc_clane> I mean, you could test it
[17:16:37] <j0hn_mc_clane> but I recall I had it before without an issue
[17:17:01] <geirha> it's more work to avoid following symlinks than it is to follow symlinks, so naturally, it'll work just fine

[20:00:03] <Soliton> what's the point of that code though? why grep twice?
[20:00:47] <Soliton> just filter out 0 results instead?
[20:00:50] <OnlineCop> I've got the majority of these 'grep' aliases set to search for text within specific files (or file extensions). I often pipe those results to do additional filtering (usually via `xargs`), and run into problems. (The above xargs was just a short-for-brevity example.)
[20:01:23] <greycat> if you want to be able to use them after "xargs" the simplest thing to do would be to turn them into scripts
[20:01:27] <Soliton> well, xargs is not a shell. it has no clue about shell functions.
[20:03:25] <OnlineCop> Soliton: it's sometimes useful to have grep's `--color` enabled to quickly see the filenames, line numbers, etc. Piping and filtering out the `:0` tends to lose the color, and `--color=always` adds different colors to the ':' and the '0' right after it, so makes `grep -v` cry.

[21:33:28] <Soliton> !basename
[21:33:28] <greybot> basename(1) can strip the directory and extension from a path (dir/subdir/file.ext -> file.ext or file). A parameter expansion can do it cleaner and *much* faster: "${path##*/}", "${path%.*}", at the cost of missing edge cases like path=/ or path=/path/to/dir/

[21:34:57] <k8yun> that was it! "basename"; thanks Soliton and the bot :); eof
[21:35:32] <greycat> the real key to mastery is to learn NOT to use basename or dirname, and just do a string manipulation instead
[21:36:06] <greycat> then you don't need to remember "hey, what's the name of that old thing that's like ##*/"
[21:36:34] <k8yun> understood; will start with basename then move onto string manipulation using `cut`, `sed`, and etc.
