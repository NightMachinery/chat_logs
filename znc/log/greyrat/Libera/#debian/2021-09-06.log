[04:46:14] <velix> Is there a way to uninstall all  the drivers not needed? When installing netinstall, I'm getting ask, if I want to go "generic" or suited for this system only. I've chosen generic, but since the system is "fixed" now, I'd switch. Is this possible?
[04:46:33] <sney> yes, it's in the initramfs config
[04:46:49] <sney> it's not "uninstall drivers" but it affects how big your initrd is.
[04:47:25] <sney> change modules=most to modules=dep in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf and run update-initramfs -u
[04:47:48] <velix> sney: Thanks a lot. Added to my notebook.
[04:47:50] <Khepra> I wouldn't. the decision algo doesn't work really
[04:48:06] <velix> :D
[04:48:20] <sney> I've never had a system where it didn't work, at least you can try it and if you need to specify an extra module or two you can do that manually
[04:48:24] *** Joins: sinaowolabi_ (~SinaOwola@160.152.7.205)
[04:48:34] <sney> if it's broken for you, you can always change it back.
[04:48:36] <Khepra> maybe you're lucky and it works for your particular constellation of modules in use. but in my experience (mostly with LUKS), only "most" works consistently

[04:51:57] <sney> I did have one situation where zfs wasn't being loaded early enough in the boot process, but for that I added it to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and left the main configuration as 'dep' and that worked fine. and initrd.img is still only 19M

[05:06:55] <velix> Blondie101010: I tried qemu from "plain" Debian Bullseye (without Proxmox or anything): same lockups. So, at least, it's not the upgrade from Buster to Bullseye. But I've got tons of files to compare now :(
[05:07:33] <sney> it's presented as an option during the install, so it's something that people think about/ask about sometimes. so we have answers. if you don't mind having a 65MB initrd then it's a non-issue, but it is still something we can discuss or explain to others
[05:08:07] <Blondie101010> 65MB is not a problem
[05:09:09] <sney> people with a small /boot can sometimes run out of space with a big initrd. common newbie issue, it happened a lot with buster and luks
[05:09:17] <velix> Sure it's no issue. I just was interested how to do it :D
[05:09:59] <Blondie101010> do what?  specify the modules you need: /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
[05:10:21] <Blondie101010> find out which you really need?  by wasting a *lot* of time testing and digging

[19:14:42] <Blondie101010> is it for a different arch?
[19:14:48] <tp43_> I am hoping to land a job as embed systems builder
[19:14:50] <randall> tp43_: For package building, I'd probably start with some leaf package, so in case you break the build only that piece of software will fail. glibc is a core library, so if you break something, *everything* will be broken and unbootable.
[19:15:06] <Blondie101010> exactly

[19:20:55] <PerfDave> Embedded systems tend to use platforms like Baserock, BuildStream or Yocto to build
[19:21:03] <randall> tp43_: like iftop.
[19:21:07] <PMT> tp43_: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ seems relevant to your interests.
[19:21:20] <PerfDave> LFS is an interesting learning exercise
[19:21:26] <tp43_> Blondie101010, yeah I could get glibc from github, but I just did a apt search instead

[19:22:30] <tp43_> PerfDave, LFS is production grade
[19:22:35] <Blondie101010> you'll need to handle it on your own

[19:22:54] <Blondie101010> you won't get a job if you think like that
[19:23:59] * jelly wonders what happened to embedian
[19:24:16] <Blondie101010> but to be honest, I've never ever seen a job posting for a "embed systems builder"
[19:24:25] <tp43_> They are using it. Not me. I am just a newbie. But the industry is using busybox and LFS for IoT
[19:24:52] <Blondie101010> busybox is just a tool to save space
[19:25:10] <tp43_> Blondie101010, yeah embed needs to save space
[19:25:18] <Blondie101010> depends, but sure
[19:25:19] <PerfDave> Blondie101010: It's pretty common
[19:25:27] <tp43_> Blondie101010, after systems building coming development
[19:25:46] <jelly> surely if you want to save space you're going to use musl or similar not the yuuuge glibc
[19:25:50] * jelly hides
[19:26:29] <PMT> alpine it is :P
[19:26:35] <jelly> indeed
[19:26:44] <PerfDave> I wouldn't be surprised to find people using LFS in production, because most IoT development is utterly horrific. But most of the corporations producing embedded systems I'm familiar with use Buildstream or Yocto.

[19:29:27] <Blondie101010> tp43_:  you're receiving a real hint now...  if you ever get a job where you have to come up with a embedded system building solution, it should port an existing system to be maintainable
[19:29:31] <PerfDave> Rebuilding and redeploying your containers on the regular is the first important step of devsecops :)
[19:30:22] <jelly> shouldn't all devops be sec.  Why is there a separate word.
[19:31:01] <PerfDave> jelly: Devsecops is applying security techniques to devops, in the same way that devops is applying development techniques to operations
[19:31:08] <PerfDave> Don't ask me why it's a separate word, I didn't make it up :)
[19:31:18] <Blondie101010> those combined words with 'sec' often refer to cheap security courses marketed to attract noobs
[19:31:19] <PMT> You would think, but as it turns out, I believe a number of places didn't think it was in scope.

[19:42:36] <Blondie101010> cross compiling is used to port something
