[08:57:05] <pussipupu> And kitties
[08:57:14] <luminousnine> Yes
[08:57:20] <billionaire> Why does everyone assume that aliens or future humans are as ugly and terrifying as they're being portrayed in pop-culture?
[08:58:31] <pussipupu> I don't know that they do, we must be hanging out with different people and consuming different media
[08:58:51] <billionaire> All those sci-fi movies for instance
[08:59:55] <pussipupu> Dunno, maybe people fear the unknown, they're certainly often plenty xenophobic about other humans after all

[09:00:24] <billionaire> That's a good point
[09:01:11] <pussipupu> I want to meet aliens, on a cultural level, I bet they have really interesting linguistics
[09:01:33] <billionaire> Oh absolutely
[09:02:33] <billionaire> My answer is this -- it's quite clear that our species is only becoming more beautiful. Just compare Miss Universe to apes and neanderthals.
[09:03:49] <billionaire> Unfortunately, it's also clear that our imagination can't possibly predict the beauty evolution has in store for us.

[12:55:19] <arryana> i used up my quota of bad words for this week
[12:55:35] <luminousnine> I'm just getting started
[12:56:17] <arryana> my other half is asthmatic, and spent too much time in a mostly-closed room sanding the walls and inahling paint fumes.  he then hyperventilated and thought he was having a stroke.
[12:56:29] <arryana> way, way too much drama for me.
[12:56:42] <arryana> (he's okay)
[12:56:44] <luminousnine> Going to return home on friday, was escaping noise from apartment renovation. And damn
[12:56:49] <arryana> oooh
[12:56:51] <luminousnine> Well good
[12:57:07] <arryana> the ambulance people were super nice.
[12:57:32] <arryana> and the dogs behaved brilliantly, that's a high pressure situation for them.

[12:58:52] <arryana> eh, it was something like three years ago now.  i had ignored gallstones for too long, and perforated while infected
[12:59:25] <arryana> at that point it was 'catastropic organ failure', as i was shedding stones down my bild duct, which ripped up my liver, and my pancreas decided to join the party
[12:59:33] <arryana> bile
[12:59:48] <luminousnine> Ouch
[12:59:58] <arryana> it was a mess for a few days, so they had to stick me on heavy duty antibiotics for a few days before they could risk surgery
[13:00:28] <arryana> oh, it's all good, i felt so much better after it was removed that i fetched tea for the ward six hours after surgery, carrying my drains.
[13:00:34] <arryana> haven't had an issue since.
[13:00:53] <arryana> but i could see why the dogs would feel ways about ambulance people
[13:01:22] <arryana> i always make a point of asking police, fire, and rescue (in uniform) if they mind petting the dogs, as i don't want the dogs to be suspicious of uniforms
[13:01:42] <arryana> the last thing any emergency worker needs is a panicked dog.

[14:32:56] <Samian> What kind of poor logic is that
[14:33:25] <Samian> I should have responded "yeah that's you want. You want to verify that someone has a job to lose than no job at all!"
[14:34:35] <Samian> just because someone *could* lose their job and be in the same position as someone who currently doesn't have a job, doesn't mean that it's okay to accept a new tenant who doesn't have a job just because you could have a tennant who had a job upon moving in also be in the position of not having a job if later fired.!

[14:35:19] <Samian> That's the last straw. i ordered 2 books on logic mailed to my mom
[14:36:54] <Samian> My mom is 70 years old and didn't even know what double vision is. For the first time in her life she held her finger out, looked at it, then looked at an object 20 ft away passed it to notice that when looking 20ft away the finger turns into two fingers in a double vision effect. How can someone be 70 years old and do that simple experiment. i'd expect everyone to have done that by the age of 10, not 70
[14:37:16] <Samian> Have a good evening. I need to sleep this over
[14:38:15] <Keter> Your mom must not question the logic of the mighty Samian.
[14:41:15] <arcturus> be nice to your mom, you fool
[14:43:19] <Samian> arcturus  when my mom was *not* nice to me yelling and screaming at me when I was in high school, everyone was fine with that.
[14:43:45] <arcturus> ah
[14:43:56] <arcturus> well i wasnt aware of this
[14:44:41] <Ungwelian> So is this some kind of revenge against an elderly woman then?
[14:44:48] <mwsb> lol
[14:45:01] <Samian> If tough measures of meaness are justified in the name of "desperate times call for desperate measures" then I can use that same logic to be mean to my mom until she reads those logic books!
[14:45:10] <Ungwelian> "You yelled to me when I was a teen. Now take this, you granny!"
[14:46:03] <Samian> "Get up out of your bed Samian! You will not sleep all day here!"
[14:47:35] <arcturus> maybe you were a naughty child and needed the correction
[14:50:21] <Samian> yes I was a bad child. But my mom is bad for failing to learn logic just as bad as I was bad for not wanting to do my homework.
[14:50:36] <spruit11> yelling and screaming underrated as a pedagogical tool
[14:50:38] <Samian> it's her turn to have homework. it's her turn to be misbehaving for failing to do it.
[14:51:04] <arcturus> idk that logic books are the best way to learn to be logical
[14:51:32] <arcturus> shouldnt you just explain to her the idea of credit risk, and conditional probability of default given unemployment?

[14:57:32] <arcturus> thats p implies p
[14:58:55] <Samian> "The fact that poor people are happy shows money doesn't buy happiness" <-- this to me has the same logical relationship as saying "The fact that some people can take road A to get to destination Happiness is proof that road B cannot also take you to destination Happiness"

[23:01:21] <brigand> life is senseless
[23:01:57] <spruit11> but amusing
[23:03:05] <Samian> brigand life is senseless until your senses stimulate you to act. Hunger stimulating you to look for food.  The pain of a knife piercing your flesh stimulating you to fight or flight.
[23:03:36] <Samian> brigand early humans didn't even have time to think about life. They were too busy looking for fooding and fighting off predators
[23:04:00] <Samian> thinking is for those who have satisfied the more basic needs of food and shelter
[23:06:38] <brigand> life is suffering
[23:06:43] <pussipupu> not really no
[23:07:02] <pussipupu> the dawn of agriculture and civilisation drastically reduced free time
[23:07:45] <spruit11> hmpf,  and then people used their free time to watch TV
[23:13:30] <emmeka> Samian pussipupu is right, oddly enough, hunter-gatherers expended vastly less labour hours getting food than early agricultural societies. Agriculture's benefit wasn't freeing up labour, it was increasing the carrying capacity of territory by actively managing food production.
[23:14:47] <Panther> That's easy for you to say.
