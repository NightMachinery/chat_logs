[22:17:02] <nij-> Sorry I was cut off last time. I'm still trying to run from source correctly, as indicated here (https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/documents/README.org#run-from-source)
[22:17:57] <nij-> Followed the steps, but `nyxt-version` still gives: <INFO> [12:45:23] Version 2.1.1-1447-g6643d9c0 .. which is not the latest :(
[22:19:11] <lagash> nij-: you mean, unstable? that looks about right
[22:19:37] <lagash> I don't know WHY the versioning string is like that, but that's what I get. Perhaps someone from the team can explain the reasoning?
[22:23:51] *** Joins: waleee (~waleee@2001:9b0:21d:fc00:398f:b003:b90d:acf4)
[22:26:02] <nij-> unstable? I'm not sure. On github it says that the latest version is 2.2.4.
[22:33:24] <lagash> uh, that's the latest STABLE
[22:35:16] <jmercouris> It’s that way because we haven’t tagged 3.0.0 and released it
[22:36:51] <nij-> Oh! Got it :) Thanks!
[22:37:15] <nij-> By the way, is there a way to fuzzy match with regex in the prompts?
[22:38:43] <nij-> E.g. Having "edit itor" in the M-x prompt will provide (at least) EDIT-WITH-EXTERNAL-EDITOR and EDIT-USER-FILE-WITH-EXTERNAL-EDITOR in the list.

[23:21:22] <lagash> I recall there was work going on improving matches..
[23:33:54] <waleee> lagash: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/5b5c463817bfae93c7720b4a26000e93c964afa4
[23:35:03] <waleee> found the pr https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/pull/1951 (manually merge by aartaka)
[23:37:32] <qhong> nij-: which version are you on? The master version (with my algorithm in effect) have EDIT-WITH-EXTERNAL-EDITOR and EDIT-USER-FILE-WITH-EXTERNAL-EDITOR ranked 2nd and 3rd places
[23:38:20] <qhong> nij-: I agree supporting full regex might be one step forward. I'm not entirely sure though. regex feels like UNIX-y rather than lisp-y to me
[23:38:29] <nij-> Nyxt version 2.1.1-1447-g6643d9c0
[23:38:43] <nij-> Do you have "edit itor" in your prompt?
[23:38:57] <qhong> nij-: yes I input exactly "edit itor"
[23:39:03] <nij-> How emacs people do is to allow different kinds (even customized) matchers.
[23:39:32] <nij-> E.g. see this https://github.com/oantolin/orderless#component-matching-styles
[23:39:59] <nij-> So I think it makes sense to allow the users to define and select which matchers they want.
[23:41:01] <nij-> qhong: Ah... my bad. I messed up the color, so more options seem to not exist.. thanks for checking with me.
[23:41:11] <qhong> nij-: fyi, my new algorithm does something similar and is already orderless. It will be in 3.0.0
[23:41:42] <waleee> qhong: lagash's on https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/6643d9c0 so he should be using the new algorithm
[23:42:34] <waleee> the 2.1.1 in the version string is because the dev version-string hasn't been updated
[23:42:50] <qhong> waleee: ok I see
[23:43:34] <waleee> so some manual checking is needed of the bit after "...-g"

[23:46:50] *** Joins: dv^_^ (~dv@eclipse.oxfordfun.com)
[23:47:21] <nij-> qhong: Thanks for you contrib! Will the users be able to select their own matchers?
[23:48:01] <nij-> Take my org-roam dir as an example.. I have ~5000 files and expect it to grow. Sometimes it's better to use strict matching.

[23:49:48] <waleee> doesn't org-roam use an sqlite db instead of insane amounts of file accesses?
[23:49:53] <waleee> *a
[23:50:38] <waleee> so that the the fuzzy matching isn't entirely dependent on the number of files
[23:51:34] <qhong> nij-: not yet, but it might better be. I need to think about the right API
[23:51:47] <nij-> waleee I dunno. I'm a doom user and there's some hack to use helm or ivy to do the searching.
[23:52:01] <qhong> maybe just copy emacs and have a `*completion-styles*` variable
[23:52:04] <nij-> And once helm/ivy kicks in, it's possible to hack many things, including matchers.
[23:52:11] <nij-> qhong:
[23:52:43] <nij-> I think it's not an easy subject. Emacs have ivy and helm. The latter is full-fledged but huge.. worth studying any ways.
[23:53:06] <qhong> nij-: Yes I'm helm user
[23:53:11] <nij-> Recently there's vertico. I'm not sure how to compare that with helm, but it seems to gain popularity because it uses more emacs-native stuff.
[23:53:30] <nij-> I'm sadden by the fact that helm is dependent to emacs.
[23:53:30] <qhong> for the time being you can bruteforce redefine prompter::score-suggestion-string
[23:53:40] <nij-> THanks qhong.
[23:53:54] <qhong> nij-: I find architecture of Nyxt prompter pretty similar to helm
[23:54:00] <nij-> I think helm is powerful and should be factored out from emacs.
[23:54:11] <nij-> That's good to know.
[23:54:12] <qhong> maybe only thing missing is persistent actions (?) let me check
[23:54:26] <nij-> But in general I think we need to create a portable helm.
[23:54:45] <nij-> So we don't need to write a helm for each LISP system.. one for emacs, one for nyxt, one for stumpwm.. etc.
[23:55:01] <qhong> nij-: or maybe just have one LISP system...
[23:55:05] <nij-> It should be stand alone. So in each LISP system we only need to write a thin UI.
[23:55:14] <nij-> qhong: That's not going to happen.
[23:55:41] <nij-> IIRC jmercouris has a prospect to have LISP OS coming back again.
[23:55:44] <qhong> nij-: not going to happen soon. But I'm working on a structural editor in Nyxt currently, hope it work out
[23:55:56] <nij-> Anyway, if we have a lispy portable helm, that's going to benefit the lisp community by a lot!
[23:56:05] <nij-> what's a structural editor?
[23:56:26] <waleee> nij-: eg https://github.com/disconcision/fructure
[23:56:36] <nij-> qhong: If nyxt prompt is close enough to helm, then we only have to factor it out. Maybe I can pick on this job! I want something like this for a long time.
[23:56:40] <qhong> nij-: see wikipedia. But in short, it's an editor that operates on structured document rather than unstructured character array
[23:57:00] <qhong> nij-: The editor I'm designing will primarily operates on S-expr
[23:57:14] <nij-> Oh! This is another thing that should be factored out.
[23:57:33] <nij-> You know, lisp is so great and it's a shame that most people got scared by emacs when they first trying to learn.
[23:57:33] <jmercouris> There is a prompter library
[23:57:48] <jmercouris> Other programs can reuse our work
[23:57:53] <jmercouris> We did not strongly tie it to Nyxt
[23:57:54] <nij-> jmercouris: Was it designed to be coupled with nyxt?
[23:58:03] <nij-> oh I will take a look great.!
[23:58:19] <jmercouris> https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/master/libraries/prompter
[23:58:24] <qhong> nij-: seems that it's not dependent on nyxt
[23:59:18] <jmercouris> Almost all of our work that can be done as a library is done so
[23:59:27] <jmercouris> Look in the libraries folder
[23:59:32] <nij-> qhong: Btw, do you know lispy or paredit?
[23:59:49] <nij-> jmercouris: That's awesome. I'm digging in :)
[23:59:52] <qhong> nij-: sure, how can I hack lisp without any of them :)
[23:59:55] <qhong> I use paredit
