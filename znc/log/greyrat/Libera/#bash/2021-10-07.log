[06:03:56] <yitz> The function still accesses $1 but you don't call it with an arg
[06:04:25] <Hazoune> I see, thanks!
[06:05:19] <Hazoune> I am thinking handling errors but -set euo pipefail is better I think
[06:05:44] <emanuele6> !-e
[06:05:45] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
[06:05:48] <emanuele6> it's not better
[06:06:20] <emanuele6> yitz: accessing $1 that is *not* a problem. what do yo mean?
[06:06:55] <yitz> emanuele6: did you read the shellcheck error? How is $1 being accessed when it is not passed in?
[06:07:32] <emanuele6> so what?
[06:08:03] <Hazoune> I mean it's not my code, I just want to know how it is working and now I can understand. To bot reads the line given by me and it is a false error because I didn't call the function.
[06:08:07] <yitz> So that explains the shell check error

[06:10:43] <Hazoune> Yeah, that's what I to know, emanuele6. Shellcheck isn't my question here.
[06:10:58] <Hazoune> I want to know*
[06:11:18] <yitz> Usually people check command RCs by doing :    cmd || die "cmd failed doing X"

[06:11:54] <emanuele6> a failure is defined as when a command returns a number that is not 0
[06:12:56] <emanuele6> [ $? -ne 0 ] (which is vulnerable code, it should be written instead as [ "$?" != 0 ] to avoid problems) checks if the last command returned a number that is not equal (-ne) to 0
[06:13:39] <yitz> That's a string check. Use -ne for numbers -- or better yet, use ((
[06:13:56] <Hazoune> I see
[06:14:03] <emanuele6> if so, it prints a message if it was passed in with `echo $1' (again, this code is faulty, it should be: [ "$1" ] && printf '%s\n' "$1")
[06:14:13] <emanuele6> and then it exits with -1
[06:14:49] <yitz> Exit statuses are unsigned ints so -1 is not a valid/possible RC
[06:14:56] <emanuele6> again exiting with -1 makes no sense because a program can only exit with a number 0-255, so it should be something like exit 1 instead

[06:16:22] <yitz> !((
[06:16:23] <greybot> ((...)) is an arithmetic command, which returns an exit status of 0 if the expression is nonzero, or 1 if the expression is zero. Also used as a synonym for "let", if side effects (assignments) are needed. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ArithmeticExpression>.

[06:41:41] <mindhunter> Hey, I just tried to exploit a setuid binary using file descriptors and created an fd using {fd}>file. This syntax for some reason doesn work with the binary so i used fd<>file which only worked once. Any idead why?
[06:41:47] <emanuele6> [[ var -ne 0 ]] && (( var != 0 )) will convert var to a number
[06:42:22] <emanuele6> yitz: you said it showed (( var != 0 )) as (( var = 0 )). that is still valid..
[06:42:25] <mindhunter> ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222 (the ctf)
[06:42:38] <mindhunter> pw: guest
[06:42:49] * llua is going to not ssh to a random host
[06:43:38] <mindhunter> Just want to know the reason behind this strange behaviour
[06:44:02] <emanuele6> fd<>file is not valid, do you mean {fd}<>file?
[06:44:25] <mindhunter> No i mean a number followed by <>file
[06:44:30] <mindhunter> like 12<>file
[06:44:41] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[06:45:07] <llua> that creates a read-write fd where as >file only creates a write
[06:45:17] <llua> +fd
[06:45:19] <emanuele6> well 12<> file is technically not correct either because you are only allowed to directly specify numbers 0-9, but i guess it works
[06:45:41] <mindhunter> Okay but why only once?
[06:45:58] <emanuele6> you can use {fd}<>file to create a filedescriptor for read-write
[06:46:07] <emanuele6> mindhunter: how are you using it?
[06:46:11] <llua> it does it as many times as you do it
[06:46:12] <yitz> JuiceSSH is rendering != as â‰ 
[06:47:46] <mindhunter> emanuele6: The binary performs an strcmp with the a string and the characters obtained from an fd. Passing the strcmp gets the flag
[06:48:21] <emanuele6> "passing the strcmp"?
[06:48:36] <mindhunter> I mean the if condition
[06:48:57] <mindhunter> strcmp is within an if
[06:49:03] <emanuele6> i have not logged to that host, i don't know what you are talking about
[06:49:53] <emanuele6> i understand you want to exploit strcmp(3), but that does not answer "how are you using it?" (it -> the 12<>file, that "only works once")

[06:51:09] <mindhunter> Yes the binary reads from an fd of our choice. So i created a file under tmp with the string thats being compared and opened it with an fd
[06:51:30] <mindhunter> Passed that fd as argument to the binary

[20:01:53] <emanuele6> pattern matching is only supported in [[, in [ patterns will simply expand as globs (often causing syntax errors)
[20:02:15] <yitz> ![
[20:02:16] <greybot> [ or test is the POSIX test command. It can do simple tests on files and strings. In bash, you should use the more powerful [[ instead and ban [ for sake of consistency.

[22:27:19] <JamesFerret> Hey everyone, is there anyone who could advise me on whether to learn Vim or Emacs?
[22:27:31] <JamesFerret> I want to use at least one for bash scripting
[22:27:46] <JamesFerret> At least to learn a supposedly better way
[22:28:01] <llua> use both and pick what you like
[22:28:12] <greycat> Any Linux/Unix user should know the fundamentals of both vi and emacs.  Which one you choose to specialize in and learn more than the basics is up to you.
[22:28:12] *** Quits: shad (~shad@user/shad) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[22:28:37] <JamesFerret> Really? Fundementals of both? Why though?
[22:28:56] <greycat> Because virtually EVERY program on Unix derives its key bindings from one of them.
[22:29:20] *** Joins: extern (~archer@141.226.62.6)
[22:29:28] <greycat> Bash has both modes, and its key bindings in interactive editing mode are whichever mode you choose (emacs by default).
[22:30:30] <JamesFerret> I see, personally I haven't come across vim frequently but yeah emacs since its the default
[22:30:34] <hyrcanus> there's no need to create bash scripts in any particular editor JamesFerret : they are just textfiles
[22:31:02] <JamesFerret> Yeah, I know. That's what I've been doing
[22:31:17] <geirha> just don't use notepad.exe
[22:31:29] <JamesFerret> I guess it's the linux user in me, excited in the prospect of adventure
[22:31:57] <JamesFerret> greycat: which one do you prefer?
[22:32:01] <greycat> vi
[22:32:18] <hyrcanus> vi lets me get work done with few keystrokes
[22:32:18] <JamesFerret> why?
[22:32:50] <JamesFerret> So Emacs=logical and Vim=efficient?
[22:32:59] <llua> zzz

[22:35:15] *** Quits: zeden (~zeden@user/zeden) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[22:35:54] <NRK[m]1> emacs is bloat, vi is bloat
[22:35:58] <NRK[m]1> real unix users use ed
[22:35:59] <greycat> The primary reason I learned vi after trying both emacs vi is because at the time, I was accessing the university's Unix systems over a 1200 baud modem.  And when I wrote anything more than a few lines in emacs, it constantly redrew the entire screen to move the text around.
[22:36:07] *** Joins: zeden (~zeden@user/zeden)
[22:36:25] <geirha> You'll be fine learning vim instead of vi. If you in the future actually need to learn vi, it's really just a matter of learning which features of vim are not in vi
[22:36:26] <greycat> vi on the other hand would simply scroll the terminal up a line.
[22:37:04] <JamesFerret> there never is an end to "real unix users.." huh

[22:40:15] <earnestly> To be fair

[22:40:38] <JamesFerret> ?

[22:41:10] <geirha> and some TUIs that use vi bindings sometimes use hjkl and arrow keys both, but for different movements
[22:41:14] <earnestly> There are often more appropriate motions to use than hjkl and ones that better set up the dot command, which is the primary feature
[22:41:27] <koala_man> hjkl for player 1 and arrows for player 2
[22:41:31] <NRK[m]1> proper way to navigate is using motions
[22:41:43] *** pyzozordd is now known as extern
[22:41:45] <geirha> and qwop for player 3?
[22:41:49] <earnestly> I tend to use hjkl when I feel like not thinking and just bruteforcing everything
[22:42:25] <earnestly> That said I've since bound loads of things like navigation to hjkl so I'm not going to forget it anytime soon
[22:42:56] <earnestly> All because some ADM terminal had arrow legends on hjkl
