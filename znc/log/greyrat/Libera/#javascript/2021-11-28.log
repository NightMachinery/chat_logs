[00:10:04] <EdFletcher> seriously, it's _really_ rare for them, can't remember the last full outage they had
[00:10:40] <EdFletcher> and yeah there really have been a lot lately... more bad-actor traffic? I know I just read about a record-breaking-volumetric DDoS attacked mitigated by CloudFlare...
[00:10:57] <EdFletcher> something like >2TBPS? absolutely crazy levels of traffic
[00:10:58] <stenno> is it another mirai-style ?
[00:11:14] <stenno> i know mirai iot thingy hat insane throughput in the TB region
[00:11:15] <EdFletcher> dunno, but that would definitely make sense
[00:11:27] <EdFletcher> has to be a pretty big botnet to launch attacks that large!

[00:12:21] <EdFletcher> this is the attack from earlier this year i was thinking of fwiw https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/cloudflare-terabits-ddos-attack/

[06:29:36] <SrPx> systemfault: yes, I've done my research and downloaded / tested every single of these available (there aren't many). Since most require a canvas, only one works in Deno.js. But the one that does work on Deno.js outputs an incorrect result.
[06:29:43] <Rockwood_> systemfault, o/
[06:30:20] <SrPx> I could've just asked why that Deno.js example outputs an incorrect result, but it involved matrix multiplications, so I thought it would be way more useful for everyone to ask for a simpler Hello, world example which we can build upon.
[06:30:57] <SrPx> it is harder to satisfy SO folks than a C++ compiler
[06:31:00] * SrPx sighs
[06:31:02] <systemfault> WebGL is a browser tech, not server-side... and you're talking about Deno, that confuses me.
[06:31:29] <systemfault> I'd probably look for Cuda(nVidia) bindings or something if I had to do server-side
[06:31:41] <SrPx> I meant WebGPU, sorry. Deno.js ships with WebGPU, but no Canvas, obviously. WebGPU allows you to access the GPU from JS. It is essentially an improved WebGL that is on the workings.
[06:32:03] <SrPx> It *can* be used to render images, but not necessarily. I can also be used like CUDA.
[06:32:15] <SrPx> But unlike CUDA, it isn't proprietary and limited to nVidia GPUs.

[07:37:09] <Rockwood_> ah okay
[07:38:37] <pavonia> Time is up!
[07:39:17] <Rockwood_> Time never ends
[07:39:28] <Rockwood_> :D
[07:39:36] <carlino3> we have a multiplayer game developed with node and socket.io.
[07:39:36] <carlino3> a player can create a room and another player can join it. once an opponent joins the game, the game starts.
[07:39:37] <carlino3> the game is an object stored server side in memory, that holds the state of the game and also executes some game logic.
[07:40:26] <Rockwood_> so..
[07:41:02] <carlino3> now, we want to use an horizontal scaling approach, having multiple nodes behind a load balancer. the problem is that players could be connected to different nodes, so storing these game objects in memory will not work
[07:41:54] <carlino3> we can store the game state in a database, but i can't think of a way to run the¬† game logic in a "decentralized" way
[07:42:00] <carlino3> any idea?
[07:43:51] <Rockwood_> still not clear to me may be my english not enough to understand the stuffs like that

[15:27:30] <GuiToris> I'd like the background to be less visible on action
[15:28:19] <GuiToris> on second thought, I should have said background image
[15:28:32] <GuiToris> I meant that, not sure you thought the same
[15:29:00] <silly> oh a background-image less opaque?
[15:30:15] <silly> i think you'll have to put it in a child element and make the whole thing less opaque
[15:30:31] <silly> maybe ask in #css
[15:31:15] <silly> changing body opacity would affect every visible element on the page

[17:57:23] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, all event handlers receive an implicit event argument as the first function argument
[17:57:44] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, since baz is called from both foo and bar always pass their event object to baz
[17:58:14] <austincheney> ThePhilgrim, then in baz you can see what DOM node triggered the event with event.target
[17:58:16] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, so I only need to use the event
[17:58:20] <ThePhilgrim> right
[17:58:51] <ThePhilgrim> so I can do the different behavior in something like if (event.target.id === X) {...} else {...}
[17:59:04] <austincheney> hold on there is an additional property on the event object you need to be aware of.... i am looking for the docs

[18:01:01] <ThePhilgrim> And what is the difference between target and currentTarget?
[18:01:20] <qswz> target is the elemnt where the thing happens
[18:01:30] <austincheney> the different between event.target and event.currentTarget is where the event is assigned relative to where the execution occurred.  event.target points to the element where the event is assigned, but may not be the element of action (due to bubbling)
[18:01:30] <qswz> currentTarget is where the handler is registered
[18:02:00] <austincheney> event.currentTarget is the local element where the action occurred irrespective to where the event is assigned
[18:02:33] <qswz> <button><span>foo for example, click handler on button, currentTarget will be btton, target wll be span
[18:02:45] <austincheney> qswz is right.  I have that backwards
[18:02:46] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, okay.. I'll do some console.logging to see the differences here! Not so easy to understand from explanation xD

[20:50:59] <stenno> CanvasRenderingContext2D has a method putPixelData but not RGBA or UNSIGNED_BYTE

[22:10:35] <jwpapi> xochilpili: but it works?
[22:10:44] <systemfault> Maybe I'm just blind because it's sunday... but that code is just fine
[22:10:52] <jwpapi> to what is it related?
[22:10:57] <jwpapi> xochilpili:
[22:11:07] <systemfault> There's no "lost binding" here.
[22:11:48] <stenno> its probably the situation in which that attribute is called
[22:11:50] *** Joins: reallymemorable (~reallymem@ip68-9-215-56.ri.ri.cox.net)
[22:11:53] <stenno> that function
[22:11:58] <xochilpili> systemfault, that depends of call-site isn't ?
[22:12:06] <stenno> but should work fine like this, yeah
[22:12:26] <stenno> n> const foo = { a:23, b: function() { console.log(this.a + 4); }}; foo.b()
[22:12:30] <jellobot> (okay) 27
[22:12:38] <systemfault> xochilpili: "this" is used twice in that code, both times in a function where the "this" is indeed skillPro, maybe the problem is at the callsite
[22:12:59] <systemfault> *skillsPro...anyway
[22:13:04] <xochilpili> systemfault, yeah, that's why lost its binding
[22:13:22] <systemfault> But the call site is not shown in the snippet...
[22:13:31] <jwpapi> I mean the warning says `potentially invalid reference to this`
[22:13:41] <jwpapi> I wonder how else I would write code
[22:13:41] <xochilpili> systemfault, yeah, most likely  it's refering to global
[22:14:06] *** Joins: comatory (~ondrejsyn@217.11.241.69)
[22:14:40] <systemfault> jwpapi: That code I'm seeing, is fine. Could be slightly shorter by removing the "function" keyword and the ":"... but it would be the same
[22:15:03] <jwpapi> So I can turf off that inspection
[22:15:25] <systemfault> Maybe it's a sign of something else... no clue.
[22:15:56] <stenno> we don't have the situation where the function gets called

[22:30:15] <xochilpili> every post about intersection with & operator, seems to be as im using but...
[22:31:28] <systemfault> You just need to understand precedence...
[22:32:03] <systemfault> You believe that LoginCode & { userInfo: UserInfo, orgInfo: OrgInfo}[] means (LoginCode & { userInfo: UserInfo, orgInfo: OrgInfo})[]
[22:32:12] <systemfault> But it means LoginCode & ({ userInfo: UserInfo, orgInfo: OrgInfo}[])
