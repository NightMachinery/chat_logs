[17:05:45] <rob0> Interesting, I think I received a targeted spam/phish.
[17:06:02] <Khepra> oh do tell!
[17:06:31] <rob0> Claims to be from my company CEO, but using a gmail address which doesn't sound like it would be him.
[17:06:42] <rob0> asked for my cell number
[17:07:19] <rob0> it's not "spam" in the sense that it probably was not automated.

[17:07:58] *** Joins: cool110 (~mark@88-107-182-99.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com)
[17:08:12] <Khepra> so the CEO is subscribed in the email with his name?
[17:08:37] <Khepra> like, hi <your real name>, this is <CEO's real name>, would you kindly give me your phone #  ?
[17:08:41] <rob0> yes, his name in the From:
[17:10:08] <rob0> but I think my cell number is in official company resources he would have access to
[17:10:10] <Khepra> it is possible the CEO's computer(s) were hacked. From time to time I see email From: and To: combinations that shouldn't be available to public bots, and my only logicl conclusion is that the sender's computer/device is infected and contacts are leaked
[17:10:32] <Khepra> often it happens shortly after I email someone for the first time
[17:10:34] <cool110> Ah, some spear-phishing
[17:11:03] <rob0> yes, his daughter is my grandboss, I will talk to her when it's a decent hour
[17:11:15] *** Quits: jotik (~J@user/jotik) ()
[17:11:41] <cool110> Given it's coming from gmail it's more likely to be someone using publicly available info

[17:11:56] <rob0> like Linkedin, yes
[17:12:14] <rob0> and firstname.lastname@domain is doable
[17:12:35] *** Joins: jotik (~J@user/jotik)
[17:12:51] <rob0> but it's interesting to think what they'd do with my cell number other than sms spam
[17:13:08] <rob0> doesn't seem worth spear phishing
[17:13:31] <rob0> my suspicion, this is war-related
[17:13:50] <Khepra> my public email is admin@ourcompany.tld, but that's alias (along wiht postmaster@ other similar things) to my name@;  so when I see some vietnamese IP pretending to be the person I recently emailed for the first time, and sends to my name@ instead of public... that person is likely infected. I never use my name@ anywhere, no logins to sites, no mailing lists, nowhere. can only come from infected recipients.
[17:15:42] <rob0> Our company is offering free service to Ukrainians and anti-war Russians.
[17:15:58] <Khepra> oh them rooskies wanna play ball then :)
[17:16:11] <Khepra> hope y'all have ironclad security policies
[17:17:10] <rob0> heh.  We've got holes in holes.  Our whole holes are holy.
[17:17:44] <rob0> actually, the main issue is that we're open to bunches of potential vectors
[17:17:52] <Khepra> I mean, whenver you put humans in a security equation, that's a breaking point right there.
[17:18:03] <rob0> in that almost everything we have is outsourced
[17:18:18] <Khepra> "whoopsie"
[17:18:44] <rob0> an attacked breaking into any of those services could potentially break into others

[17:19:32] <rob0> This thing arrived at 23:25 my time, which is 22:25 his time.
[17:21:33] <rob0> oh hmm, the TZ in the Date: header is India
[17:22:05] <rob0> not sure if this stupid Outhouse Web App is showing me complete headers
[17:22:16] <Khepra> oh that explains it. the good doctor just went to a vacation in India and forgot to tell you. phew. just give him the #  :)
[17:22:33] <rob0> hehe u so funy
[17:23:55] <Khepra> ikr :)
[17:25:08] <rob0> ah yes, there are complete headers, the little Message Detail thing is scrollable
[17:25:52] <rob0> and haaha it does have what looks like a forged Received: header
[17:27:24] <rob0> it definitely did come through gmail to our ESP
[17:30:17] <Khepra> rob0: what industry is your company in?
[17:31:12] <rob0> "security" haha

[18:43:49] <rob0> an interesting thing here is that gmail provides no information about message origin; the first Received is a 6to4 address.
[18:44:24] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:45:58] <rob0> I believe that means it came through gmail webmail, but the time mismatch is curious.  Wouldn't webmail set the Date: header, and it be the same (close to) the others?
[18:47:51] <rob0> The TZ is not India as I first thought, it's CET, 13.5 hours before the mail was delivered.

[19:58:45] <jaybe> g strips out origins of submission 
[20:03:00] <rob0> last I knew I thought they only did that for webmail.  Yikes.  They are stupid/evil.

[20:06:36] <jaybe> apple recently made an os change that sort of 'hides' the submitting host, etc.  e.g.  'mail.client' versus actual system hostname
[20:07:00] <rob0> it means anyone can submit any mail with bogus headers and be completely hidden
[20:07:06] <jaybe> on the surface without considering otherwise, it seems 'good'
[20:07:15] <jaybe> if authorized, yes
