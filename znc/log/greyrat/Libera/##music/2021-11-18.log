[13:56:23] <assan> ummm
[13:56:38] <assan> my producers use fl & cubase
[13:56:57] <assan> then i think one was made on logic 
[13:57:15] <louipc> neet

[13:58:33] <assan> yeah 
[13:58:58] <assan> in philosopher i did it all
[13:59:11] <louipc> producer?
[13:59:23] <novns> assan, still boring
[13:59:23] <assan> then jordan maxwell outro
[14:00:04] <assan> ohhh novns, i dunno probably would make something you find okay later in the future 
[14:00:17] <assan> what's your spec? novns 
[14:00:17] <novns> sure
[14:00:34] <novns> assan, my spec is music have to bring surprises
[14:00:39] <novns> something new
[14:00:44] <assan> louipc, producer is elda, not popular yet haha 
[14:00:48] <novns> something that was never done before
[14:00:58] <assan> lol 
[14:01:01] <novns> something at the very new level
[14:01:07] <assan> i hear you
[14:01:09] <louipc> ohkay i thought you meant that you did producing too
[14:01:18] <assan> no no
[14:01:38] <assan> just elda and manik makes the sound 
[14:02:02] <assan> then i do the writing and delivery 
[14:02:15] <louipc> novns: what if its something thats old that you never heard?
[14:02:21] <assan> but i direct the sound tho 
[14:02:32] <assan> i tell em what to play 
[14:03:02] <novns> louipc, that would be interesting
[14:03:26] <assan> novns i would try, am confident i would make great music in the future to come 
[14:03:33] <louipc> play more cowbell
[14:04:00] <novns> louipc, I've discovered the microtonal music of 16 century recently
[14:04:06] <novns> and it was a big surprise
[14:04:17] <louipc> from what country

[14:04:39] <Janet> ^ Nicola Vicentino: Musica prisca caput - YouTube
[14:04:42] <novns> this one for example
[14:04:52] <louipc> cool
[14:05:14] <novns> you see, they used quarter-tone keyboards
[14:05:52] <louipc> that gonna hurt my brain
[14:06:06] <novns> it sounds very unusual to our ears
[14:06:31] <assan> well not to my ears 
[14:06:32] <louipc> the indian ones sound 'normal' tho
[14:06:35] <novns> he got used to 12 half tones with equal temperation
[14:06:38] <novns> *whe
[14:06:43] <louipc> yea
[14:07:38] <novns> and I love when I hear something unusual and beautiful
[14:07:52] <novns> read "not boring"
[14:09:22] <hype> Hi
[14:09:33] <louipc> things can get boring quick after youre used to them
[14:10:01] <novns> louipc, but why would you repeat things that were done 1000 times before
[14:10:16] <novns> these drum loops are so typical
[14:10:31] <louipc> for fun
[14:10:35] <assan> hello hype 
[14:10:38] <novns> it's not funny
[14:10:46] <novns> fun is creating something new
[14:10:56] <novns> not repeating
[14:11:23] <louipc> then better use a different instrument for each note
[14:11:43] <novns> that would be a mess
[14:11:48] <novns> and still not funny
[14:11:57] <louipc> but its not repeating
[14:12:03] <louipc> hugheughue
[14:15:04] <novns> louipc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-JqH1M4Ya8
[14:15:08] <Janet> ^ David Bowie - Lazarus (Video) - YouTube
[14:15:08] <novns> listen to this one
[14:15:32] <novns> it's rather simply but not boring at all
[14:16:10] <novns> you can hear new things each time you listen this one
[14:16:40] <louipc> it repeats stuff tho
[14:16:43] <novns> it's very deep and it have layers so beatifully arranged
[14:17:05] <novns> so you never get tired of listening
[14:18:13] <novns> and it has something that's often missed in modern music
[14:18:51] <louipc> this is modern music
[14:19:13] <novns> nope, it's modern recording but old school

[14:20:00] <novns> *who was
[14:20:10] <louipc> david bowie is modern music
[14:20:24] <novns> nope, he's rather classic rock
[14:20:45] <louipc> rock is modern music
[14:21:32] <novns> modern music is when you use presets in your FL, loops that everyone use, and you even not trying to sing

[14:22:09] <louipc> ok. i disgree with your words for things
[14:22:25] <louipc> well that is modern too sure
[14:22:54] <novns> lazyness
[14:23:06] <novns> that what modern is
[14:23:07] <louipc> you are a music snob
[14:23:10] <novns> sure
[14:23:20] <novns> but I'm having some real fun
[14:23:33] <louipc> theres no validity in that. its just your aesthetic preferences
[14:23:57] <louipc> which everyone is free to have
[14:24:06] <novns> validity is when you create new things, that were never done before
[14:24:13] <louipc> nope
[14:24:17] <novns> and this is rare today
[14:25:15] <novns> some bands in 60s invented a new style for every new album
[14:25:31] <novns> and in 70s too
[14:25:37] <louipc> snobbery is not validity
[14:26:09] <novns> and that's why I love 70s prog rock, because every recording is so different there
[14:26:19] <novns> nothing was the same
[14:27:08] <novns> and this thing I don't see in your average frooty loops track
[14:28:53] <louipc> thats the definition of averge
[14:29:01] <novns> and it's weird because creating music is very cheap today, you don't need to pay a studio $1000 to record your track
[14:29:40] <novns> you have so much power in your hands today, with all these synths and effects
[14:30:07] <louipc> ok go make some
[14:30:24] <novns> sure

[22:52:56] <murthy> what kind of guitar style is that at 4:15
[22:53:14] <murthy> I am liking it a lot and I hear it in the stoner rock music
[22:53:55] <murthy> I am wondering if this is done with guitar alone or later effects are added
[22:54:49] <macrobat> electric guitars are fed through effect boxes more often than not
[22:55:16] <murthy> oh those that are controlled by those foot pedals?
[22:56:10] <murthy> Is that a known kind of effect or a custom effect/present
[22:56:56] <macrobat> something like overdrive + flanger + delay + reverb?
[22:57:13] <macrobat> idk https://youtu.be/GCbGdgbkd8c?t=99

[22:57:28] <murthy> oh yes flanger
[22:57:35] <murthy> ya and reverb
[22:57:41] <murthy> what is overdrive?
[22:58:27] <macrobat> gain
[22:58:31] <murthy> oh ok
[22:58:43] <macrobat> lighter distorsion
[22:58:51] <murthy> ya
[22:58:56] <macrobat> there's no hard line between overdriver and dist
[22:59:03] <murthy> gives you somekind of retro effect
[22:59:09] <murthy> like cyberpunk music
[22:59:16] <macrobat> there wasn't much overdrive on that, maybe none
[22:59:56] <murthy> oh ok
[23:00:08] <murthy> can this be expremented with LMMS?
[23:01:00] <macrobat> I don't use lmms. can it use ladspa?

[23:22:12] <murthy> audiobirb: listening to music and installing stuff on my desktop, what are you upto?
[23:22:59] <murthy> audiobirb: [4:29:01 pm] <novns> and it's weird because creating music is very cheap today, you don't need to pay a studio $1000 to record your track

[23:23:13] <murthy> audiobirb: may be you should share your experience with novns
[23:23:23] <audiobirb> lol
[23:23:27] <audiobirb> i pay $500 per song 
[23:23:36] <murthy> :)
[23:23:42] <murthy> novns: see?
[23:23:47] <audiobirb> technically, yes, you can learn mixing/mastering for 10 years and have a decent sounding song
[23:23:58] <audiobirb> but i dont have that kind of time
[23:24:02] <audiobirb> and i want it well done
[23:24:09] <murthy> Also my personal opinion is that I clearly see the quality different when a music is recorded in a studio
[23:24:21] <murthy> thats is why the words "Studio quality"
