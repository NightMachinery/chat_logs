[01:06:32] <ether> vms14: possibly, but that's not a "just". it would involve ensuring that a module is loaded in every test file first, in order to get that override activated

[01:34:48] <vms14> I'm kind of interested in event driven programming so it's nice
[01:38:32] <nshp> threads are almost universally discouraged (not just in Perl) for tasks which are I/O-bound. things like AnyEvent or POE (or lower level, select()) are definitely the right answer.
[01:39:31] <LeoNerd> perlbot: threads
[01:39:31] <perlbot> LeoNerd: The use of interpreter-based threads in perl is officially discouraged (see http://p3rl.org/threads ) - please let us help you find a better way (see also http://goo.gl/yMZeag for more details, and https://goo.gl/o8PwA7 for some alternative options)
[01:40:06] *** Joins: Fozzworth (~Fozzworth@user/fozzworth)
[01:40:10] <vms14> Apart from these, the strongest argument for using closures with AnyEvent is that AnyEvent does not allow passing parameters to the callback, so closures are the only way to achieve that in most cases . xd liked that
[01:40:12] <LeoNerd> perlbot: async
[01:40:12] <perlbot> LeoNerd: Asynchronous event-driven IO is awesome in Perl with POE, IO::Async, IO::Lambda, Mojo::IOLoop, Reflex among others; made nicer using Future, Mojo::Promise, or Promises
[01:40:36] <LeoNerd> Oh; yeah AnyEvent forces you to do a lot of that annoyance, it's not very nice. Use -aaaaany- of the other event systems, the channel will help much more
[01:40:39] <LeoNerd> perlbot: anyevent
[01:40:39] <perlbot> LeoNerd: <mst> we don't support AnyEvent. it's shit and the author is insane. | Use ANY other event system, and you'll be much happier.  See async.
[01:40:41] <LeoNerd> ^--
[01:40:52] <vms14> wtf
[01:41:26] <vms14> why
[01:41:52] <LeoNerd> Mostly because AnyEvent (and its author) are actively hostile to everything else. They're not good things to have around
[01:42:32] <vms14> lol, the pod said the reverse was true
[01:42:44] <LeoNerd> Well of course the module -itself- wouldn't say that...

[01:47:57] <vms14> the real reason is, I came to programming just because I wanted to make a game, and for some reasons (world pressure and alike) went to web development and didn't even started with gamedev
[01:48:34] <vms14> and I've decided to focus in perl so it's likely I'll try to make a game in Perl xD

[02:23:06] <vms14> LeoNerd: yeah, sorry I came from xlib
[02:23:27] <vms14> that's why when I saw tk I was like oh..

[02:24:50] <vms14> the perl xlib binding does not provide the xpm extension, not sure about the xshape, wanted to reproduce it in perl but it's left as a project for when I'll go to xs
[02:24:50] <aquanight> half the problem of perlifying anything win32 really is that's only really of value to anyone who actually runs perl on win32. How often does that happen?

[06:45:47] <aquanight> boolean(8)
[06:45:59] <aquanight> so you mean you have like @q = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1) ?
[06:46:19] <aquanight> and this represents 103?
[06:46:54] <daemon> yeah
[06:46:56] <daemon> so
[06:46:59] <daemon> Got: 011100101100
[06:46:59] <daemon> Got: 100011010011
[06:47:04] <daemon> how do you multiply them
[06:47:05] <aquanight> oct("0b" . join "", @q)
[06:47:10] <daemon> convert both to decimal first
[06:47:45] <daemon> was looking at https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=149032
[06:47:47] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Binary multiplication ]
[06:48:07] <aquanight> oct("0b" .....) will convert the binary string to a normal integer
[06:48:10] <aquanight> that you can then do math on
[06:48:40] <daemon> what is 0b and why would it do that
[06:48:47] <daemon> I expected to have to use (un)pack here
[06:48:49] <aquanight> binary
[06:49:21] <aquanight> you can also use 0x to conver hexadecimal strings
[06:49:40] <aquanight> sweval: oct("0b011100101100")

[06:50:18] <perlbot> aquanight: 1836
[06:50:27] <aquanight> you could also do it with eval if for some reason you don't like oct
[06:51:07] <daemon> how the heck would you do it with eval
[06:51:15] <daemon> not that I would, I am not just curious
[06:52:46] <aquanight> just exactly the same
[06:53:00] <aquanight> concat 0b in front of your 0/1 string and pass the lot to string eval
[06:53:17] <aquanight> in that case you're basically creating a binary constant using perl
[06:53:21] <daemon> I had no idea
[06:53:29] <daemon> aquanight++ # extra beard
[06:53:29] <aquanight> but really oct is better for this
[06:53:44] <aquanight> for so many reasons
[06:53:56] <daemon> you mean like it was made for it specifically :P
[06:55:47] <daemon> something is a bit wrong though ... 
[06:55:52] <daemon> the ansewr should be 4147524
[06:56:21] <aquanight> seems legit

[06:56:36] <aquanight> .....
[06:56:49] <aquanight> did you remember the 0b part?

[16:11:48] <Botje> you should be decoding that, at best, and I suspect $mech->content is already properly decoded.
[16:11:56] <Botje> verify with printf "%vx" $mech-<content
[16:12:18] <Altreus> or $mech provides decoded_content, like LWP
[16:12:36] <Botje> or that.
[16:13:57] <haj1> $mech->content _is_ $mech->response()->decoded_content()
[16:14:27] <zkrd> because it contains some strange characters
[16:14:49] <Botje> $mech should have taken care of decoding them. 
[16:15:12] <zkrd> but those characters pose a problem to DBI if I not encode it to utf8
[16:15:30] <Botje> yes, you solve that problem _when you talk to DBI_, not before.
[16:15:36] <Botje> and ideally you let DBI take care of it for you
[16:15:38] <Botje> perlbot: encoding mantra
[16:15:39] <perlbot> Botje: decode goes from BYTES to UNICODE CHARACTERS. encode goes from UNICODE CHARACTERS to BYTES. decode bytes to unicode characters as soon as possible, work with unicode characters, and encode to bytes as late as possible.
[16:15:53] <zkrd> ok, I will test it
[16:16:31] <Botje> the only way to solve encoding issues is to methodically work from one way to the other. arbitrarily adding encode and decode leads to tears.

[18:45:56] <Altreus> I don't know if it's intentional but the fact the hashes are meaningless is *good*
[18:45:57] <pragma-> time is just a human construct
[18:46:06] <Altreus> The *only* important information to git commits is the parent
[18:46:17] <Altreus> it's later because it has the former in its ancestry
[18:46:33] <Altreus> The power of that is in being able to swap it all around if it makes history easier to read
[18:46:55] <pragma-> rewrite history is what dictators dream of!
[18:46:57] <Altreus> if you bake in ordering from the get-go you have to introduce gaps when you amend the tree

[18:49:42] <revhippie> "I'm'a count to 3.  1... 2... 2 and a half... 2 and three quarters..."
[18:50:15] <huf> or you could restrict all git repos to only a single commit
[18:50:18] <huf> that orders easily
[18:50:19] <pragma-> back in the days of line-numbered BASIC, we'd step the code be 10 or 20 or even 100 and then slowly filling in the lines in between over time
[18:51:02] <Botje> and more often than not 19 would become  GOTO 3410
[18:52:03] <Altreus> revhippie: ah, the parenting threat

[19:59:29] <Altreus> doesn't perlbrew set up the environment just as local::lib does anyway?
[20:01:18] <xq> it does
[20:08:59] <ilmari> `perlbrew lib` gives you per-perl local::libs
[20:09:27] * ilmari uses that to not install anything in the actual perls he brews, but creates an `std` lib for each that he actually uses
[20:10:03] <ilmari> that way I can always get exactly the set of modules that was shipped with a given perl version by creating a new lib
[20:14:25] <Altreus> there's something to be said for the npm way of putting it all in the project dir when you install the deps
[20:14:47] <Altreus> npm's default is equivalent to shipping a cpanfile and then using local::lib=.
