[02:45:45] <Axman6> vertical alignment of code is very important, it makes it much easier for me to read, and the only way to do that with imports at the moment is by doing ugly things like tomsmeding's post above (https://paste.tomsmeding.com/bpwrBBcP). 
[02:46:35] *** Joins: justIrresolute (~justache@user/justache)
[02:46:47] <Axman6> it also greatly reduces commit noise, if you have code where you had no qualified imports and then add one you need to change every import line. having post qualified imports means only that line changes

[03:25:17] <lechner> is this still true?   https://stackoverflow.com/a/34867087
[03:26:47] <geekosaur> don't thread and fork in the same program
[03:26:53] <geekosaur> in any language
[03:27:00] <lechner> you are right
[03:27:16] <geekosaur> fork makes all threads go away, and god alone knows what locked resources will never be unlocked
[03:28:39] <geekosaur> that said, the reason signals are relayed to the main thread is not that they're specifically handled in a separate thread, it's that posix makes zero guarantees which thread receives the signal
[03:28:53] <lechner> yeah

[09:05:31] <Axman6> EvanR: because of the way glirc shows joins and parts, lavaman's been shown as lavaman+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+ .. lavaman+x+x+ .. lavamanx+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x, which made your comment even better
[09:05:43] <EvanR> lol
[09:06:13] <sshine> ahhh -- this is a joke for those who don't ignore joins/parts. :)
[09:06:29] <EvanR> I like how glirc compresses it but still makes it annoying

[09:15:49] <EvanR> I was just reading about literate haskell, or literate programming. And the idea sounds interesting. But what is the practical workflow like. Does it only produce pdf "papers" or can you generate nice web pages
[09:16:05] <EvanR> and what is "it"... a ghc flag?
[09:18:07] <sshine> Axman6, right. I usually prefix my messages when answering people, but that has certainly happened a few times over the years.
[09:18:32] <sshine> Axman6, (and in the process of prefixing them for the n'th time, realize that the completion doesn't work.)
[09:19:13] <sshine> EvanR, .lhs files -- and yeah, you could generate LaTeX or Markdown, I guess.
[09:19:54] <EvanR> wait generating markdown sounds... like stepping backwards
[09:20:10] <EvanR> compiling from markdown?
[09:20:14] <sshine> sorry, yes
[09:20:41] <EvanR> oh, so the markdown is the "nice" version
[09:20:47] <EvanR> something somewhere shows it nicely

[09:21:57] <sshine> yeah, so comments on the outside, code on the inside, rather than the other way around like we usually do.
[09:22:41] <sshine> and what I was thinking about, IIRC, was this: https://github.com/sol/markdown-unlit#readme -- but that's not regular .lhs format.

[09:27:23] <maerwald[m]> EvanR: https://entangled.github.io/
[09:27:41] <sshine> but I might still generate Markdown because I like the idea of using Markdown as the data format for blogs. :) I keep most of my notes in Markdown. CodiMD (that is, HackMD.io's open-sourced back-end) has pretty good MathJax support for embedding LaTeX equations.
[09:27:44] <maerwald[m]> But I think none of those things are practical for everyday programming 
[09:29:01] <EvanR> ah cool
[09:30:11] <maerwald[m]> I think what's more important than documentation is module structure, so that module level documentation can tell a good story. Then you can have directory level hacking documentation as well (haddock could support this, in fact)
[09:31:20] <EvanR> just saw a rant about how literate programming is not documentation it's a PARADIGM!!!!!
[09:31:41] <EvanR> actually yeah I just got done with some documentation, but it doesn't address any internals
[09:31:58] <EvanR> so I was like how about literate haskell somehow which necessarily includes internals
[09:33:44] <maerwald[m]> It makes changing code even harder
[09:34:10] <maerwald[m]> Imagine refactoring, moving code to different places etc
[09:34:38] <maerwald[m]> You'll just have so write the story from scratch 
[09:34:48] <EvanR> yeah
[09:35:22] <EvanR> it's better as an article or demonstration that's easy to check by compiler
[09:35:56] <sshine> yeah, it's pretty neat for writing tutorials.
[09:36:01] <sshine> one-page tutorials :P
[09:36:35] <maerwald[m]> I also think it's more worthwhile to separate documentation of behavior from documentation of intention 
[09:36:53] <sshine> maerwald[m], how so?
[09:37:01] <sshine> what's an example of documentation of behavior?
[09:37:28] <jackdk> `// add one to i`
[09:37:30] <maerwald[m]> When intention changes non-trivially, that's a strong sign you should rewrite the entire function, instead of adjusting it
[09:39:08] <maerwald[m]> Programmers tend to tweak behavior to the point when the original intention has nothing to do with the current intention 
[09:39:17] <maerwald[m]> Then you're usually left with messy code
[09:39:31] <maerwald[m]> The only way to find out is documenting intention

[09:44:02] <sshine> maerwald[m], where do you think the two kinds of documentation should be separated? I usually have one place where I document stuff, and that's in comments above functions. :)
[09:44:10] <sshine> and also at the top of modules.
[09:44:53] <maerwald[m]> sshine: the first line of the documentation should reflect the intention. Then newline and then you can document behavior

[09:46:27] <EvanR> I'm now convinced writing documentation is pointless thanks maerwald[m] xD
[09:46:41] <EvanR> unless it's something that never changes like Functor
[09:46:42] <maerwald[m]> E.g. "We want to extract the device of the path, if any". Subsequently, there will be a lot of edge cases
[09:46:48] <EvanR> which... barely has any docus
[09:47:42] <maerwald[m]> But the intention is simple
[09:50:27] <sshine> maerwald[m], ah, okay. :) I think I'm sort of doing that without being conscious about it. mostly of the "intention" part being the most zoomed-out description I can give something without scope-creeping the explanation.
[09:51:17] <maerwald[m]> sshine: right, but the catch is the intention must never be changed
[09:51:25] <maerwald[m]> If it does, write a new function

[14:49:03] <[exa]> hi!
[14:49:49] <ishan_> i have just started learning haskell and i had a small doubt
[14:50:32] <ishan_> why does <min "oh" "hello"> return "hello"
[14:51:25] <[exa]> because the comparison is lexicographic, and AFAIK 'h' < 'o', at least in ascii
[14:52:31] <ishan_> ahhh ok ok makes sense
[14:52:35] <ishan_> Thanks!
[14:52:38] <[exa]> if you want to compare by lengths, you can construct something like `minOn`
[14:52:43] <[exa]> let's try
[14:52:55] <[exa]> > minimumOn length ["oh", "hello"]
[14:52:57] <lambdabot>  error:
[14:52:57] <lambdabot>      • Variable not in scope:
[14:52:57] <lambdabot>          minimumOn :: (t0 a0 -> Int) -> [[Char]] -> t

[15:56:28] <raehik> I have a data type with 2 typevars, first is the promoted type, and one of the fields is a type family on both typevars -- which is where the error message is coming from
[15:57:49] <raehik> as a human I can look at the equation for the given promoted type and know the actual type of the field, and now the instance is boring
[15:58:05] <[exa]> raehik: is there a proof that the functor argument type doesn't get used e.g. as a contravariant in the type family?
[16:00:21] <raehik> no I don't think so. but a single equation in the type family would have that proof, and I don't mind writing out multiple derivings for each constructor of the promoted type

[17:44:45] <geekosaur> really, the easiest solution is to have the package maintainer upload their locally generated docs, and cabal makes this easy enough that they should have done so

[19:02:25] <merijn> k`: Pretty sure the main reason stimes exists is because it's neat and fairly easy to implement, so might as well! And then leave it up to Semigroup users to find instances where it's useful :p

[19:03:14] <merijn> k`: Also, keep in mind that Semigroup was originally in a different library that "basically every possible operation/feature of semigroups you could think off"
[19:03:58] <merijn> It was only moved into base fairly recently to make Semigroup a superclass of Monoid, but kept all the minor features so backwards compat is easier
[19:04:15] <k`> merijn: Oh, did it start as one of ekmett's libraries?

[19:19:50] <k`> Fold with a commutative semigroup in the wrong direction and you can get massively worse performance for no reason at all. For example foldMapping a `Map` or `Set` to `Any` or `All` requires evaluating about half the map or set. But if you knew they were commutative, you could just fold with the dual on the appropriate half.
[19:20:17] <merijn> k`: You can just do that yourself in the stimes definition, though?
[19:20:32] <k`> Not talking about `stimes` here.

[19:24:43] <k`> Assuming GHC always compiles `foldMap` of a strict semigroup to the equivalent of `foldMap'`, I agree.
[19:26:39] <k`> Much like `stimes` it's complexity that you can ignore if you like. And there's not really code to get wrong. You just say `commutative = Just Dict` when you know it's commutative. Or `case commutative :: a of Just Dict -> Just Dict; Nothing -> Nothing`.

[23:48:53] <lechner> Hi, with this code receiving and sending ZeroMQ traffic, I eventually see "file descriptor 1024 out of range for select (0--1024). Recompile with -threaded to work around this." dsal once said there was an issue with the "finalizer". Am I running out of file descriptors? Thanks!    https://paste.tomsmeding.com/8ofcOqTl

[23:51:41] <monochrom> EvanR: The doc says "O(m+n)" so I don't think there is a difference between "intersect x y" and "intersect y x".
