[04:27:39] <humanBird> because it expects a jenkinsfile on that image
[04:27:45] <artok> there is no need for vim in container as containers should be run non-interactively
[04:27:45] <humanBird> and i need to create the jenkinsfile.
[04:28:00] <humanBird> look i'm not doing this in production
[04:28:09] <humanBird> i'm trying to get jenkins to work and it requires docker for some reason
[04:28:15] <artok> you create that jenkinsfile outside and inject that into the image
[04:28:23] <humanBird> because the jenkins community says they support other OS but they don't.
[04:28:53] <BtbN> Last time I looked at Jenkins, it runs anywhere with a JVM without much care of anything else.
[04:29:10] <tabakhase> jenkins and docker oddly ennuf is still a pain tbh...
[04:29:18] <artok> or better, you have portable image that will read if there is some jenkins file on named volume and kick that in
[04:29:25] <humanBird> until you need to agent { docker { image 'python:3.10.1-alpine' } }  and it starts doing undefined things like looking in random places for the imagge
[04:29:40] <tabakhase> there concept of server/runners doesnt alignt all that well and they never cleaned up there first hacky way to make it work to all i know
[04:30:18] <humanBird> things were completely non working as of 2 days ago in the jenkins docker plugin
[04:30:40] <humanBird> they started confusing $ and % paths for environmental variables and you just couldn't use docker
[04:30:59] <artok> so, edit your jenkins file on host, and docker cp it into container
[04:31:10] <humanBird> it's there in their repository. it's broken.  anyways.  doing this CP command to get a file in there which I will most likely modify a lot is probably too heavyweight and slow
[04:31:35] <BtbN> Copying a config file into an image is a bad design anyway
[04:31:40] <tabakhase> if you can, id recommend switching to some CI that takes it a bit more first-party ;-) gitlab-ci or github actions are great :P
[04:31:57] <artok> well then have another container running rsync into your folder that is shared with jenkins image, and then you just kick restart on the jenkins container
[04:32:12] <BtbN> Or... use a volume?
[04:32:21] <artok> BtbN: to the volume directory, not
[04:32:22] <artok> yeah
[04:32:23] <tabakhase> also on "modding files" - if that is a config, it likely sits in a volume or so already, so one can "docker run --volumes-from thatothercontainer vim:latest ..." ;-)
[04:32:39] <humanBird> this whole "docker inside docker" approach they are using seems stupid
[04:32:54] <artok> jenkins is stupid
[04:33:24] <artok> <insert anything with java> is stupid
[04:33:26] <artok> =D
[04:33:54] <humanBird> like why would you put docker or some other "almost virtualization" layer on top of another
[04:34:33] <tabakhase> humanBird DinD itself is nice - but verify you are actually talkign about dind first lol :P -- as in, "running additional privilidged docker-daemons inside containers" -- jenkins first way was "to use the hosts dockerDaemon" and not all docs use clear wording
[04:35:17] <humanBird> "In order to execute Docker commands inside Jenkins nodes, download and run the docker:dind Docker image using the following docker run command:"
[04:35:22] <humanBird> seems pretty clear to me
[04:35:30] <tabakhase> and the "why" is easy, isolation -- running 2 cipipelines of the same project will otherwise blow up if they both compose-up or such ;D - also makes the cleanup very simple as you can just shoot the thing in the head
[04:35:31] <humanBird> https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/
[04:36:19] <artok> but anyways, jenkins able to start slaves and so on is just permission to underlying docker daemon, it is good
[04:38:21] <humanBird> also, if it's supposed to be completely non interactive why even enable bash and why did that particular image come with git?
[04:38:38] <humanBird> git is change control. you don't need change control if you're not supposed to change anything
[04:39:40] <tabakhase> humanBird if i understand that link right, this moel runs "one dind that then used by the jenkins runner"
[04:40:27] <tabakhase> gitlab-ci goes with "every job gets his own dind" for example
[04:42:24] <humanBird> the basic problem i'm trying to fix is that Jenkins expects all the config files (which are user controlled/git revisioned data files) to exist inside the docker. but you can't edit them apparently
[04:42:45] <humanBird> getting them from whatever editor to the jenkins inside the docker seems like a pain
[04:43:17] <humanBird> you're forced to copy or use some heavy weight thing. it's not just "save the file"
[04:43:33] <artok> humanBird: where they are located? have named volume for configs for sure?
[04:44:09] <humanBird> Jenkins expects them to be located on the docker container under revision control
[04:44:25] <humanBird> so you modify the jenkinsfile, you git commit and this all has to exist inside the docker
[04:44:44] <humanBird> so it's worse than just having a volume.  you need to copy the git changes over too
[04:44:50] <tabakhase> just use --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home in whatever container to spawn what you need - who cares that THIS has no vim if thinca/vim:latest exists *shrugs*
[04:47:00] <humanBird> will this see change live?  ie, i won't have to restart container all the time?
[04:47:27] <DoofusCanadensis> Jenkins wants you to keep your pipeline config in your project's repository
[04:47:42] <DoofusCanadensis> that's how every CI works these days
[04:48:03] <humanBird> jenkins also looks for the pipeline config inside the docker container from where it's running.
[04:48:04] <tabakhase> the file will update - if jenkinsdaemon watches for that, reconsumes and reconfigures? i wouldnt think so ;D
[04:48:21] <DoofusCanadensis> jenkins own config lives in a jenkins-data volume
[04:48:31] <DoofusCanadensis> but that's for controlling Jenkins, not your builds

[04:49:35] <tabakhase> "that's how every CI works these days" ya wish... - but yes with dude talking about Jenkinsfile were talking about file in your repo, not the old internal-xmldump-webui config way
[04:50:13] <DoofusCanadensis> for gitlab, I create a yaml file in my project repo to control the build
[04:50:18] <DoofusCanadensis> same for github
[04:50:24] <tabakhase> (also where you see how all this gets tripple-funny, not only did jenkins kinda hack in docker, but then they added jenkinsfile ontop :D)

[04:54:33] <humanBird> repository.  it's definitely looking inside the container for the git repo.

[04:59:25] <humanBird> i'm trying to get a volume to be seen by an already existing container somehow not sure if there's a command for that
[04:59:58] <DoofusCanadensis> volumes get mounted at container creation, iirc
[05:00:26] <DoofusCanadensis> or at least container start if not
[05:03:09] <humanBird> seems like i would need to create a new container each time.
[05:03:38] <artok> containers should be disposable and able to recreated on any given time
[05:04:18] <artok> data is persistent, containers can be killed and restarted
[05:04:57] <tabakhase> > would need to create a new container each time < - correct, the changes one can make on an existing container are basically "nonexistent"
[05:05:07] <humanBird> the workflow of making a revisionable change (ie changing a comment) shouldn't require a container restart just to see the change.  seems like if you're using a local git this is what you have to do. this is not good
[05:05:33] <tabakhase> see docs of "docker update" i think? - its like 3 or 4 values, and those are only about scheduling/allocation

[05:09:01] <artok> that is too much of VM thinking of containers if you can't throw away your container and start another to replace it in just seconds

[05:09:53] <DoofusCanadensis> I remember being there
[05:09:56] <artok> code changes should be triggering the jenkins by other ways
[05:10:15] <tabakhase> humanBird not sure if you are tossing jenkins config and project config in the wrong/same bucket there...
[05:10:18] <artok> they are called git actions afaik?
[05:10:48] <humanBird> like the git repository has to live somewhere and jenkins needs to to access it.  it first looks on local and then a remote repo.  right now i can't use gitlab/gibhub/bitbucket/whatever.
[05:11:09] <tabakhase> artok "actions" is github-ci -- you may mean hooks? - like a post-receive hook inside a bare repo is the "manual way" to github-via-ssh ;D
[05:11:15] <humanBird> restarting a container for code changes is ridiculous so it seems like the only logical way to do this is have the git remote live in some other container and expose git to the outside world in that container
[05:11:21] <artok> yeah hooks
[05:11:30] <artok> that's the general git term
[05:12:02] <tabakhase> <3 gitolite on that note :P
[05:12:12] <artok> so you add git hooks to the project so that will send your jenkins-ci info that "hey, checkout and do stuff"
[05:12:58] <DoofusCanadensis> gitolite is fun
[05:13:06] <humanBird> the problem is the "checkout and do stuff".  it's looking first locally on the actual "machine" for the changes. this is the docker container that has no root user.
[05:13:12] <DoofusCanadensis> I'm gonna miss some of our customisations when we move to GitHub
[05:13:23] <DoofusCanadensis> why can't you use a hosted Git anyway?
[05:13:44] <artok> humanBird: why would it need root user privileges?
[05:14:15] <humanBird> i tried creating the jenkinsfile directly
[05:14:31] <humanBird> in any case. seems like i need to use the networking features of git to solve this
[05:14:49] <DoofusCanadensis> have you tried your docker pipeline as a direct pipeline instead of a jenkinsfile?
[05:14:53] <tabakhase> ive used gitolite _a lot_ until like  ~2016 when i got gitlab -- but gitolite is still in use to this day for some specific usecases
[05:16:15] <tabakhase> (its quite a bit more hardened than gitlab and all there like for example... ;-) )
[05:16:15] <humanBird> https://snipboard.io/NP7xDv.jpg i've considered it DoofusCanadensis.  A drop down with only one option in it seems like UX fail

[05:18:27] <humanBird> heh. i'm following the "guided tour" documentation in jenkins
[05:18:37] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, I think that's where humanBird is trying to get
[05:18:54] <DoofusCanadensis> and yeah, guided will recommend multibranch pipeline because it's more powerful
[05:19:00] <artok> and since that is worker, it can have root access while the actual CI daemon is run with whatever, it has docker api access to start those images so it has root privileges
[05:19:23] <DoofusCanadensis> but with plain pipeline, you can write the pipeline inside the Jenkins job itself. zero need for Git or any other SCM
[05:19:24] <tabakhase> why would you use jenkins when you start with the tour o.O -- i would understand if you are finilar with jenkins and its your baby, but if you are getting into it, dude, gtfo while you can :D

[05:36:53] <DoofusCanadensis> and jenkins set up in a docker host with that docker:dind container running. fetches the alpine python image and runs the container with "python --version"
[05:37:46] <DoofusCanadensis> nice to see the jenkins install docs in action... I always got to "okay my server is up and running. now what?"
[05:38:10] <humanBird> but you skipped the step that says "create a multi pipeline build" right?

[05:38:59] <humanBird> guess you didn't read the guided tour docs
[05:39:18] <DoofusCanadensis> no. I just followed the installing jenkins with docker docs
[05:39:42] <humanBird> i figured if it's a "guided tour" you can't go wrong but it's very wrong
[05:39:42] <DoofusCanadensis> fiine. guided tour it is
[05:40:07] <humanBird> it's fine. i'm building the image with gitolite so i don't have to restart the container every time there's a code change
[05:40:46] <DoofusCanadensis> oh... that one... hang on
[05:41:54] <humanBird> keep in mind private local git repo.  There was no requirement or pre-req to have gitlab/github/bitbucket
[05:42:01] <humanBird> that's not in the docs at all.

[06:25:29] <DoofusCanadensis> in production you'll use baremetal then

[06:26:01] <DoofusCanadensis> and honestly? all my production workloads are in VMs whether or not docker is in play

I bought it in namecheap) and want to host my gitea instance in git.dirtcastle.com. so naturally to host website and gitea I'll use 
[11:48:04] <dirtcastle> different ports. For nginx I use -p 8000:80. For gitea I will use another port. I can't specify ports in dns.

[14:34:29] <tabakhase> retype that first sentence :D -- on gitlab heavy, is kinda yesno... i came from gitolite, whats klike the entire-opposite-end, but my instance is big ennuf (user/org wise) that i dont care to mach if it wants 8 cores and 32gb ram so be it :D

[16:09:56] <Johnsen> your server_name defines a virtual host, so afaik it will only serve that page/config if you have a dns entry with that name pointing to your server and using it in your browser, and that location with a proxy_pass to yourself and then repeated with a root is not correct either,   but the default config in the official nginx image servers everything in /usr/share/nginx/html/ so if you only wanna serve

[17:22:21] <Johnsen> there is no default answer to that, some distros have it on, some not i guess, some VPS/cloud providers will have it on in their images, others not
[17:22:45] <dirtcastle> i use debian 10
[17:22:59] <dirtcastle> in virtualbox
[17:23:17] <Johnsen> i don't think debian has a firewall by default, are you using bridge or nat in virtualbox?
[17:23:37] <Johnsen> nat will most likely not accept connections at all, bridge should
[17:23:47] <dirtcastle> is it safe to disable firewall. I'll be hosting websites and many stuff in the future. 
[17:24:32] <ikke> It's good to have one to avoid accidentally exposting things you didn't want to expose
[17:24:35] <Johnsen> well, if that box is open to incoming connections that means outsiders would be able to connect to every exposed port
[17:24:55] <ikke> though, if you expose things with docker, they are publically available
[17:24:58] <Johnsen> so personally i only open the port to my reverse proxy, but not anything else
[17:25:14] <Johnsen> unless planned, like openvpn
[17:25:50] <dirtcastle> i use NAT. Johnsen

[17:26:26] <dirtcastle> i haven't done portforwarding yet
[17:26:46] <Johnsen> bridged will give your VM its own ip from your router and act like its just another pc connected to your network

[17:28:20] <dirtcastle> i use a broadband router with wifi
