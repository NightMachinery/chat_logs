[05:19:18] *** Joins: mikolajw (~mikolajtc@2001:470:69fc:105::3b02)
[05:20:45] <DiffieHellman> Pine64's hardware isolation is quite good even so, they keep the mobile and Wi-Fi chipsets separate and connect to them with a DMA free connection method.
[05:22:03] <DiffieHellman> Additionally, their privacy switches are excellent - rather than asking nicely for the chip to power itself down (which is pretty much most of what physical Wi-Fi off switches on laptops do, the switches cut the power.
[05:22:05] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[05:23:20] <White__Flame> DiffieHellman: thanks for the details, somebody was claiming DMA and stuff before
[05:24:40] <DiffieHellman> As you can shut off all the proprietary transmitter chipsets if you don't want them, that issue is semi-solved. The remaning issues is the SoC, as they use ARM. The problem with ARM is that the SoC manufacturer gets an opaque ARM core from ARM, and the pin layout and then integrates that into their SoC without really knowing what it does.
[05:25:03] *** Joins: leonarth_ (~leonarth@user/leonarth)
[05:25:41] <DiffieHellman> When it comes to SoC manufacturers, Pine64 uses Allwinner an recently RockChip. Allwinner loves to violate the GPL and not actually document their hardware, while RockChip seems to actually provide some documentation.
[05:25:50] <tpefreedom> DiffieHellman, what would it take, in your opinion, for companies like pine64 to truly control their hardware?
[05:26:05] *** Joins: leonarth__ (~leonarth@user/leonarth)
[05:27:07] <White__Flame> I have heard that gov organizations like the FCC really do not want user freedom around the actual radio chips, to avoid unlicensed/improper stuff on the airwaves
[05:27:09] *** Quits: leonarth (~leonarth@user/leonarth) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:27:13] <White__Flame> so I'm not sure such changes will ever happen
[05:27:34] <DiffieHellman> To truely control their hardware, they would need to design their own processor in verilog and then convince a trustable fab to start producing that processor or maybe even a whole SoC
[05:27:42] <White__Flame> (improper as in jamming, noise, bad signals, etc)
[05:28:23] <DiffieHellman> The FCC doesn't want people blasting radio waves over the air, but they go about it in an anti-freedom way instead of an eductational way
[05:28:28] <White__Flame> they want the manufacturer to build it to spec/protocol, and only them update it
[05:29:02] *** Quits: leonarth_ (~leonarth@user/leonarth) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:29:07] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but that's an exceedingly poor idea, as a lot of manufacturers are exceedinly incompetent.
[05:29:21] *** Quits: leonarth__ (~leonarth@user/leonarth) (Client Quit)
[05:30:21] <DiffieHellman> Most Wi-Fi+bluetooth chipsets can probably be taken over over the air, as most manufatures can't be bothered to write decent firmware, or isolate the Wi-Fi and blueooth hardware.
[05:30:57] *** Joins: monego (~monego@gateway/tor-sasl/monego)
[05:33:57] <DiffieHellman> Back to DMA, mobile phones for power reasons mainly put everything into the same SoC (i.e. your mobile chipset is directly connected to the ARM processor). The mobile chipset usually has DMA, which means that anyone who controls the mobile chipset over the air can generally see everything on the mobile and even take complete control. Newer phones have IOMMU built in to prevent this from happenning,
[05:33:59] <DiffieHellman> but I doubt that any IOMMU implementation is perfect, even though they kinda need to be.
[05:35:36] <DiffieHellman> The Pinephone uses usb, which doesn't have DMA (other than the usb chipset).

[22:47:45] <Noisytoot> 4096 and 2048 are both secure (I use 4096 but 2048 is more compatible)
[22:48:30] <GNUHacker> yes, it is
[22:48:59] <elshid> https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#sec-11-4
[22:49:00] <GNUHacker> but we dont know if 2048 will be secure in a few years
[22:49:48] <elshid> Well, as it was proven that RSA is not secure when we have really good quantum computers, we need to rethink GPG generally.
[22:50:18] <elshid> Not now, but it may be an issue in a decade or so.
[22:50:24] <White_Flame> I've been using 8192 for as long as I can remember.  Takes a second, but whatever
[22:50:34] <pert> modern versions of GnuPG don't use RSA by default anymore, but ECC. ECC is more smartcard-friendly too due to the small computational overhead/key size
[22:50:47] *** Joins: ewwegweg__ (~ewwegweg@user/ewwegweg)
[22:50:49] <Noisytoot> Switch to Ed25519.
[22:51:05] <Noisytoot> Does GnuPG default to ECC yet?
[22:51:24] <pert> Noisytoot: I'm almost certain GnuPG 2.3 does
[22:51:43] *** Quits: ewwegweg_ (~ewwegweg@user/ewwegweg) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:52:47] <White_Flame> hmm, I just checked and it's actually 4096.  disappoint
[22:52:51] <pert> The 2.3.0 changelog says "gpg: Switch to ed25519/cv25519 as default public key algorithms."
[22:53:42] <ewwegweg__> GNUHacker can ı sure with torsocks gajim command? 
[22:53:53] <labrador> I don't like the ECC crypto,its not as quantum resistant as RSA and one ecdsa curve was poisoned by the NIST
[22:54:10] <labrador> I'll just use 4096 rsa and call it a day
[22:55:13] <pert> that's fair. unless you have a good reason not to, GnuPG has very sensible defaults. most guides on "hardening" it are frankly unnecessary
[22:56:33] <GNUHacker> ewwegweg__: torsocks force the tor connection
[22:56:59] <ewwegweg__> what GNUHacker
[22:57:17] <GNUHacker> but you can also config the proxy in gajim settings
[22:57:42] <pert> indeed, Gajim's preferences (under Advanced) actually seems to have an option specifically to use Tor. that would probably be preferable
[22:57:54] <ewwegweg__> ı have got proxy setting GNUHacker
[22:57:58] <GNUHacker> ok

[23:08:37] <labrador> So
[23:09:05] <labrador> If I set an expiry for a key,does that mean that any signs I had on my key disappear too?
[23:09:39] <GNUHacker> mm i need a ed255 new key :/
[23:09:44] <labrador> because that would mean people would need to reverify
[23:09:50] <labrador> That would be tedious
[23:10:18] <elshid> The signs won't disappear, but they will be no longer valid.
[23:10:50] <labrador> hmm,so its a good idea to not set an expiry date but just a revocation cert?
[23:11:09] <elshid> Depends on what you need them for.
[23:11:16] <GNUHacker> labrador: set an expire is good, you can change this when you wish
[23:11:47] <labrador> GNUHacker, wait so I can re-extend it if I'm in control of the keys? Thats what I was missing
