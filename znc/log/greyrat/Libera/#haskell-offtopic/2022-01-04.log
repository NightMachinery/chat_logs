[00:01:08] <geekosaur> not really. and consider that order is just attaching names that are generated consecutively, so those actually reduce to the same thing
[00:01:28] <monochrom> Since you speak of wires, what does a real electronic circuit do for this? Clearly it has neither order nor names.
[00:01:29] <geekosaur> although if you are talking sekrit Haskell magics there are implicit parameters
[00:02:01] *** Quits: coot (~coot@89-64-85-93.dynamic.chello.pl) (Quit: coot)
[00:03:57] <ProfSimm> monochrom: in real devices, we implicitly encode different things by position in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, and there are other abstract dimensions things may have, like the form of the plug (audio cable, USB-A, USB-C and so on), wire colors (red = left audio, white = right audio, yellow = video), shapes and so on
[00:04:26] <ProfSimm> monochrom: so in a way we're very good at disentangling properties of things and classifying them by their attributes.
[00:04:33] <monochrom> That sounds like a model of said circuit, as opposed to the said circuit.
[00:04:37] <ProfSimm> Order and name happen to be two convenient abstract attributes
[00:05:31] <ProfSimm> monochrom: if you mean how it works in the actual circuit, whether analog or digital it's all about signal travelling through a structure of pathways in the end, isn't it. 
[00:06:15] <ProfSimm> monochrom: for example if you wanna express "True" or "false" on a circuit, you'd most typically branch an electric impulse along path 1 or path 2.
[00:06:22] <monochrom> So perhaps somewhere in there hides the answer to your question.
[00:06:23] <ProfSimm> Either way the signal goes somewhere. 
[00:06:30] <ProfSimm> Nope :P
[00:06:38] <ProfSimm> It's all basically encoding in time and space
[00:06:50] <ProfSimm> Time is like encoding in order. And space is like encoding in names
[00:07:41] <ProfSimm> We can think about words as points in N-dimensional space. Made up of the sounds they're made of. We map this to another N-dimensional space, for the components of their meaning.
[00:07:46] <ProfSimm> But it's a spatial encoding in a way.
[00:07:58] <ProfSimm> And we can assemble them in statements which are spatio-temporal in nature.
[00:08:20] <geekosaur> this oughtta be fun
[00:08:29] <monochrom> You said "structure of pathways", which I think is on to something. But is it really time and/or space?
[00:09:21] <monochrom> If I move rotate a circuit in space, it is still the same circuit, but no longer the same locations and directions in space.
[00:09:43] <ProfSimm> monochrom: I don't know. I tend to reduce things to time and space a lot. Maybe I'm wrong. Space is when you can travel in a structure in no specific order other than the "adjacency list" of the relationships of the components making the path. And time, well, that requires traversing said list in order step by step
[00:10:24] <ProfSimm> monochrom: well coordinates are always relative to something
[00:10:25] <geekosaur> quantum physics questions your assertions
[00:10:43] <ProfSimm> monochrom: I never said things are absolute. :)
[00:10:47] <monochrom> Haha yikes quantum again.
[00:10:53] <ProfSimm> Well sure
[00:11:18] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: whatever I do I end up in this quantum existential rabbit hole

[00:11:46] <ProfSimm> "What do I cook for dinner?"  5 minutes later "This recipe doesn't align with quantum field theory"
[00:13:39] <hpc> here's one that will make you question reality - some researchers took a tardigrade, froze it and made it part of a quantum system, did some operations on it, then revived it
[00:15:55] <monochrom> They should be called sturdigrades. :)
[00:16:25] <monochrom> "Why are you so hard to kill???!!!"  -- some villain in some hero-villain movie
[00:16:57] <monochrom> But what evil operations do they do on it?
[00:24:37] <ProfSimm> hpc: critique of those experiments claim they just froze the tardigrade and used it as part of an electric circuit and said "it was in superposition"
[00:24:58] <ProfSimm> hpc: I'm in no position to judge it, but fellow scientists are skeptical. But they were also skeptical of Einstein
[00:25:02] <ProfSimm> So...
[00:25:16] <geekosaur> they're still skeptical of Einstein
[00:25:35] <geekosaur> always looking for ways to prove that gravity is quantum instead of a GR field
[00:25:38] <ProfSimm> hpc: I think entanglement and superpositions have an expression in macroscopic systems, we just have no clue about it (yet)
[00:25:48] * Rembane shakes fist at gravity
[00:25:53] <geekosaur> they've been observed, actually
[00:26:07] <geekosaur> it's rare and difficult but observable
[00:26:37] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: I think it's happening literally right now. For you, for me, for anything and everything. It's just hard to prove it because by definition we experience single outcomes.
[00:26:51] * geekosaur actually suspects quantum effects are emergent properties of GR, but can't formulate it in the proper physico-mathematical terms, so…
[00:27:00] <hpc> geekosaur: the best part is all the "proving einstein wrong" stuff starts from his other big result
[00:27:15] <geekosaur> yeh
[00:27:15] <hpc> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%3D_EPR
[00:28:12] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: I find the desire to present all interactions as particles (gravitons) as uninspired
[00:28:17] <geekosaur> let us not forget that he founded quantum theory as well as relativity: it all started with his first proof, that the photoelectric effect required light to be quantized
[00:28:31] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: on the other hand, probably every field, if we look close enough... is made of parts
[00:28:55] <ProfSimm> Maybe it's wrong to think of them as points in space though
[00:29:00] <geekosaur> disagree. the whole point of a field is that it is not
[00:29:17] <geekosaur> where particles come in is that they *mediate* fields
[00:29:19] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: what if a field has an innate integer resolution
[00:29:45] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: which can bend and twist under the influence of other fields, but still, be inherently integer
[00:30:16] <geekosaur> you are gradually on your way to understanding quantized energy levels
[00:30:44] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: I think about it as springs of springs. Springs made of ideal parts, like magnets. Which are in repulsion/attraction tension with one another
[00:30:54] <ProfSimm> I don't mean literal magnets.
[00:30:57] <ProfSimm> But you know...
[00:31:55] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: and if these springs can vibrate, this may be what the strings in string theory are made of
[00:32:03] <ProfSimm> (and they can vibrate)
[00:34:45] <geekosaur> I think string theory is mostly dead. these days it's all about gauge symmetries
[00:34:53] <geekosaur> E8 in particular
[00:36:17] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: in this reality, every time a question like "strings or E8 projections" are posed, the answers tend to be "both"
[00:37:12] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: it's like crystals, each model is growing up in self-consistent ways and clashing with other models, but they all fundamentally describe the same reality
[00:37:43] <ProfSimm> It's probably an issue of translation, of mapping.
[00:38:09] <geekosaur> nope. string theory has fundamental problems.
[00:38:24] <geekosaur> it may be the most recent thing you have heard of, but it's gone in reality
[00:38:34] <ProfSimm> Well, what are those problems.
[00:38:58] <ProfSimm> Last I've heard is that it simply describes every possible universe. So it has no predictive power.
[00:40:17] <geekosaur> string theory is not one single thing, so yes there are a sheaf of possible string theories that supposedly can describe anything. except they don't, and in particular there seem to be major problems reproducing our universe with any string theory
[00:40:35] <geekosaur> which is why they're looking at gauge theories these days
[00:45:16] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: but I've been thinking there may not be fundamental law underneath. Every universe a new combination of parameters.
[00:47:12] <geekosaur> this has its own problems
[00:47:38] <geekosaur> you *do not have a universe* if the fine structure constant doesn't match the one our universe has
[00:48:25] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl)
[00:48:26] <geekosaur> so there is at least one fundamental law somewhere
[00:48:42] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: the constant has been found to vary a little in different parts of the observed universe btw. Which is interesting
[00:49:29] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: imagine we're in a hot pot of water and trying to figure out a fundamental reason why it's 80 degrees C, and the answer is, someone turned the stove to that
[00:50:54] <geekosaur> that requires understanding what's outside the universe. which we cannot observe
[00:51:05] <geekosaur> you are in the realm of religion if you start playing there
[00:53:45] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: not sure it's religion. But we would be naive to consider this universe as just bunch of dirt swirling around for no purpose. I used to think that, but I feel at some point this doesn't explain enough.
[00:54:56] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: have you thought, why do we have theater, movies, stories. Why do we enjoy fiction so much
[00:56:18] <EvanR> which is why real physics doesn't get turned into movies, it's too boring
[00:56:37] <EvanR> unfortunately side effect is some people run with pop science as if it were real
[00:58:00] <ProfSimm> EvanR: school can make science boring, because it approaches it incorrectly, as a set of formulas and dogma you learn by heart to utilize.
[00:58:06] <ProfSimm> But science is anything but boring.
[00:58:12] <ProfSimm> We've barely scratched the surface.
[00:58:58] <EvanR> there's just not much room for drama in a given physical system
[00:59:38] <EvanR> it's like a continual spoiler alert
[01:02:42] <geekosaur> ProfSimm, I meant any consideration that requires knowing what is outside the universe is necessarily religion, because it cannot be observed and therefore cannot be science
[01:03:07] <geekosaur> maybe "philosophy" if you prefer
[01:03:48] <hpc> philosophy is still tied to observation on some level
[01:09:23] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: not sure we shouldn't have any consideration. We've considered black holes before we ever observed any and then figured out how to look for them, and found some
[01:10:08] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: the universe is much bigger than we can think of, but... as above, so below. So the answers may not lie that far away.

[15:35:33] <kritzefitz> My experience from idris is that you often have to juggle various variables in your head when trying to understand why certain types don't match.
[15:36:19] <kritzefitz> Even worse, some of variables may share names from different scopes, which makes it harder to keep in your head.
[15:36:27] <geekosaur> yeh, I was thinking "famous last words"

[15:37:11] <geekosaur> individually maybe they don't have to be that hard, but once they're interacting…
[15:38:44] <kritzefitz> Overall I would say the fundamental rules might be easy, but applying them correctly to larger-scale gets more complicated quickly.

[15:40:49] <kritzefitz> Also I think many people (including me) learn languages not from basic principles but more from examples and trying to use the language in the hope that the underlying principles will become clear in the process. 
[15:41:29] <kritzefitz> I'd say having to approach a concept from basic principles instead of a high-level view is already sufficient to consider that concept complex.
[15:41:35] <kuribas> kritzefitz: agreed, but isn't that because idris2 still need to grow in ergonomics?
[15:43:14] <kritzefitz> Probably, I don't know any other languages with dependent typing. But as long as the ergonomics aren't there you have to understand all the complexity yourself.
