[00:45:06] <geekosaur> you have to abuse the type system to do this
[00:45:20] <ProfSimm> I mean it's just an apply chain
[00:46:49] <geekosaur> the chain is in the wrong direction for that. "apply chain" would have (bar foo) produce a function to be applied to the options (in fact that is what the (Int -> Int) case of the typeclass would be doing), but you need the options first

[01:47:20] <geekosaur> a bit old but http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html
[01:47:32] <geekosaur> megaparsec is parsec with some improvements

[01:50:40] <tomsmeding> ... I get the same, no error message if you pass a non-existent file there
[01:51:41] <tomsmeding> so that's the most likely situation, cabal somehow thinks the file is not there -- check the obvious things first, typos in file name, correct directory; perhaps cabal's working directory is changed to the directory containing the cabal.project (I don't know, but check)
[01:51:56] <ober> :tomsmeding this is really weird, when I do cabal repl in another project that has only one package, it works fine

[09:04:01] <sm> ghcup is one way, stack is another

[09:04:24] <sclv> alternatively try using the hackage version of taffybar.
[09:04:51] <int-e> (does any version of cabal-install accept exe:foo instead of foo:exe?)
[09:04:55] <sclv> the github repo has, for some weird reason, a dep on a coinbase api which is causing the breakage

[09:09:56] <iqubic> What can I do to fix this?
[09:10:34] <sm> I'm usually not that guy, but I've reached my limit with arch haskell support. Yup don't listen to me
[09:10:36] <sclv> haskell on arch is broken, and you can install a fresh ghc with ghcup to avoid the mess or you can lean into it and read their faq which describes a dynamic only workflow that works sometimes
[09:10:44] <int-e> My fix when I was using Arch was to not use Arch's ghc packages except for bootstrapping. ghcup is probably the path of least resistance these days
[09:11:06] <iqubic> Why do people hate Haskell on Arch?
[09:11:12] <sm> (I could fix it with stack, but I won't)
[09:11:15] <sclv> right. they just package it in a way unusable for developers and won’t listen to reason
[09:11:50] <int-e> Because Arch is a rolling release but Haskell's dynamic libraries have no backward ABI compatibility. And they refuse to make the compromise of shipping static libraries.
[09:11:54] <sclv> we tell them that they need to package static and dynamic libs both, and the maintainers just say “no.”
[09:12:01] <sm> we're sick of supporting these unending problems
[09:12:32] <sclv> installing ghc outside of the arch toolchain works fine.
[09:12:40] <int-e> (Do they also split runtime and devel packages? I forgot. That may be the immediate issue.)
[09:13:02] <int-e> (But if you solve that you'll run into the rolling release issue later. Not worth it.)
[09:13:08] <sclv> they give a “static” pkg for ghc itself iirc. but its messy for some reason
[09:13:40] <iqubic> How can I get ghcup on Arch?
[09:13:59] <sclv> https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/
[09:14:06] <int-e> And in contrast to Gentoo, Arch users are not used to stuff breaking all the time. :-P So Arch gets all the hate.
[09:14:43] <sclv> here’s arch’s haskell faq if you’re curious about the messy details https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/haskell
[09:14:49] <int-e> (Arch really worked surprisingly well *except for* the Haskell part, when I used it.)
[09:19:44] <int-e> "you'll run into the rolling release  issue later" *and* it will be a huge nuisance because it'll break your taffybar (and xmonad if that's what you're using it with).
[09:20:19] <iqubic> I'm using xmonad, yeah.
[09:20:25] <int-e> (Unless they ship xmonad and that somehow works? I don't know.)
[09:20:52] <iqubic> I have xmonad installed via the packages in the Arch repo. And that just works, somehow.

[09:24:33] <iqubic> I just installed ghcup, and tried running "cabal install taffybar". Same issues arise.
[09:25:02] <int-e> It's a fundamental disagreement about the nature of shared libraries and ABIs.

[09:25:53] <iqubic> sciv: How can I do that?
[09:26:27] <sclv> well check your path and configure it
[09:26:36] <int-e> Arch's whole packaging is based on the idea that by and large, new versions of shared libraries are backward compatible. And GHC breaks that, badly.

[14:35:44] <dminuoso> Oh yes, Im starting to think if we were able to attach arbitrary information to data constructors and fields outside the type system, that would simplify generics in so many ways.
[14:36:07] <dminuoso> One of the most annoying thing about Servant is dealing with these complicated types, and extending it relies on working with complicated typeclass magic to decompose these types..

[14:45:56] <kuribas> I think dependent types and extensible records would make a servant-like API much nicer to work with.
[14:46:09] <kuribas> Because the specification is a Value, not a Type.
[14:46:20] <dminuoso> Dependent types do not generally improve the quality of your life.
[14:46:31] <dminuoso> Otherwise you'd have wraths of Haskellers switch to Idris.
[14:46:35] <kuribas> No, but they improve the quality of my code :)
[14:47:12] <kuribas> I mean, it's just like FP, static types, etc... you need to use when to use them, and use them well.

[15:06:19] <elkcl> No, I mean in the program. Like, I have a value of a record type and I need to check if all the fields were initialized
[15:06:31] <tomsmeding> impossible to check
[15:06:36] <dminuoso> Well not *quite* impossible.
[15:07:00] <tomsmeding> at least, if you want to distinguish between uninitialised and "initialised with `undefined`"
[15:07:09] <dminuoso> You can individually force all fields, and catch exceptions in IO. But you will have a really hard time distinguishing uninitialized from other bottoms.
[15:07:14] <tomsmeding> right
[15:07:19] <dminuoso> But really, -Wall is what you probably should be using
[15:07:25] <dminuoso> You shouldnt have uninitialized fields to begin with
[15:07:39] <dminuoso> Or use Maybe if you want to encode the potential lack of a field
[15:09:44] <elkcl> ok, I think I'll just use Maybe instead then, thanks

[17:14:29] <geekosaur> freebsd seems to do okay with its containerized builds (poudriere?)

[17:18:13] <dminuoso> When you have 5,000 packages using openssl, then you need to annoy 5000 package maintainers to *promptly* ship a new build. And each of these maintainers needs to annoy the upstream developer, if they even still exist, are alive, are available, have time for you, to promptly put in a fix
[17:18:19] <geekosaur> the community is 50-50 stack vs. cabal, so it'skinda difficult to try to push for one vs. the other without leaving a lot of people out in the cold
[17:18:27] <maerwald> dminuoso: huh?
[17:18:28] <dminuoso> It's just very unrealistic to get an openssl fix into these 5,000 packages in anything less than a month.
[17:18:42] <dminuoso> maerwald: well, Im just talking from a distribution point of view.
[17:18:45] <maerwald> dminuoso: for a distro, it's *irrelevant*, whether a package is linked statically or dynamically

[17:18:56] <dminuoso> of course it does.
[17:19:02] <maerwald> not really no
[17:19:09] <lechner> maerwald: it does
[17:19:10] <maerwald> the package manager knows whether the binary is insecure
[17:19:12] <maerwald> no
[17:19:23] <dminuoso> when openssl has a new CVE, you just have one package to update.
[17:19:26] <maerwald> you're not relying on the dynamic libs to figure this out
[17:19:29] <dminuoso> with static linking you potentially have thousands.
[17:19:34] <maerwald> yes, and?
[17:19:35] <lechner> sources and installables are tied
[17:19:45] <maerwald> distros have build machines?
[17:20:07] <lechner> we do not know how to update vendored sources
[17:20:19] <maerwald> whether you update dynamically linked openssl or 200 packages makes little difference in a distro with good CI, such as OpenSUSE
[17:20:29] <maerwald> lechner: that's a different topic

[17:21:21] <maerwald> it's more about: 1. attaching proper metadata to static binaries and 2. having an easy way to do mass upgrades
[17:21:22] <dminuoso> I mean it does have some inconveniences like notably increased disk usage
[17:21:37] <dminuoso> Not that this is a valid counter argument, but it is an inconvenience
[17:21:53] <dminuoso> maerwald: to some degree, this is truly easiest with nix! :)
[17:22:14] <maerwald> I think  this is pretty easy in other distros like gentoo too
[17:22:20] <dminuoso> because the build process of mass buildign everything with an updated dependency is a built in feature

[17:23:28] <maerwald> I'm not even sure pacman has a concept of reverse dependencies
[17:24:05] <lechner> consuming sources or installables is a better term
[17:24:47] <lechner> or prerequisite
[17:24:58] <dminuoso> At any rate, the biggest problem with static linking is the prominence of Drepper's extremist religious point of view.
[17:25:10] <dminuoso> With so many distributions built ontop of glibc, you're not getting static linking anywhere.
[17:25:19] <dminuoso> So foremost, it's technically not feasible. :p
[17:25:36] <geekosaur> sure it is. just need a better way to do static--except-for-libc
[17:25:45] <geekosaur> the linker can do that, it's just painful currently
[17:26:05] <dminuoso> Like I said. Technically not feasible. :p
[17:26:08] <geekosaur> and nearly impossible the way Cabal-the-lib treats linker parameters

[20:11:01] <mason0> c_wrath, I got it to work with {-# NOINLINE pureRandom #-}, as long as I pass a new () each time (so a function that calls it, needs to accept () as an argument). I am not sure if there's some edge case where this would not work, but I didn't find one
[20:11:53] <c_wraith> the important part is that it's not guaranteed to work.
