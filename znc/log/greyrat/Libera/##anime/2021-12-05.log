[06:06:26] <Terminus> i'm still monitoring it. there might be something funky going on with ipv6. i need to make sure it's not a problem with privext addresses disappearing.
[06:06:41] <markon101> IPv6 can be a bear at times
[06:06:57] <markon101> It isn't that it's hard but can be finicky with current state of things
[06:07:13] <Terminus> yeah... i've made it a point to use ipv6 whenever i can.
[06:07:36] <Terminus> this is the first time i'm suspecting addresses disappearing on a distro though.
[06:08:21] <markon101> Try ip -6 addr and see what your default route is using ip -6 route
[06:08:34] <markon101> Might illuminate what is going on a little better
[06:08:43] <markon101> Using dhcpcd?
[06:09:20] <Terminus> markon101: routes are not a problem. it's a SLAAC setup. i think the problem is related to how raspbian bullseye treats privext specifically.

[06:12:42] <Terminus> hmmm... systemd says znc itself is dying and gets restarted. an address disappearing could do that...
[06:12:46] <amigojapan> Yeah
[06:13:10] <Terminus> markon101: it generates a new random ip address out of your /64 block so addresses rotate over time.
[06:13:40] <markon101> I see. So for some reason those addresses are getting dropped.

[08:32:55] <ButterNoodle> I've never been able to look at at a server from one gen to the next and be like.... yea
[08:33:01] <ButterNoodle> thats sooo much better

[08:40:41] <ButterNoodle> oh
[08:40:43] <ButterNoodle> those things
[08:40:54] <ButterNoodle> doubtful.. 
[08:41:02] <ButterNoodle> they are a niche market
[08:41:03] <MootPoot> the cpu architecture is called zen
[08:41:08] <MootPoot> or well
[08:41:10] <MootPoot> family 
[08:41:35] <MootPoot> are they niche? for server farm people they should be a drop in replacement
[08:41:38] <ButterNoodle> I mean they should run esxi now I know what they are.. like those EPIC slugs
[08:41:44] <MootPoot> yeah
[08:41:45] <MootPoot> those thinsg
[08:41:49] <MootPoot> AMD EPYC 
[08:42:16] <ButterNoodle> yea when a company spells something wrong thats a bad sign
[08:42:27] <MootPoot> lol
[08:42:47] <MootPoot> I hear the server  ppl really dont like changing to new tech
[08:42:52] <MootPoot> or platforms
[08:43:01] <ButterNoodle> anyway.. compared to the number of factory dell/hp/lenovo servers that will house intel slugs.. they will be niche
[08:43:53] <ButterNoodle> but if they are nice and shit.. they will be cheap.. but from what I have seen on *EPIC they will be sought after by nerds because they are pretty decent
[08:44:11] <MootPoot> rich nerds
[08:44:17] <ButterNoodle> the density of cores in a home lab makes them appealing
[08:44:51] <ButterNoodle> but I'd rather buy 2 dell or hp servers and have a cold spare if one melts down
[08:45:05] <ButterNoodle> and then still have a shit tonne of cash left over for ram and storage
[08:45:58] <MootPoot> rip
[08:46:08] <MootPoot> 1700  usd plus s hipping for a 32 core spyc server
[08:46:12] <ButterNoodle> if I havent said or implied.. more ram capacity is more important than cpu
[08:47:02] <ButterNoodle> yea marginal gains from a dell r730 with decent slugs under the hood
[08:47:16] <ButterNoodle> and a 730 is probably <400
[08:48:18] <MootPoot> yeah, I guess
[08:48:25] <MootPoot> cpu performance isen't that big of a deal
[08:48:28] <MootPoot> on a server
[08:48:35] <MootPoot> you can get really far with not much computer

[09:33:31] <amigojapan> Also bought a sugar free red bull
[09:37:45] <JesseDesu> i need like 10 of those to feel any of its effects
[09:37:51] <JesseDesu> i'd rather drink a bang
[09:38:47] <amigojapan> Jesse you probably got used to too much caffeine
[09:39:08] <JesseDesu> yup
[09:39:18] <MootPoot> It's not a lot really 
[09:39:26] <amigojapan> That is fixable
[09:39:27] <MootPoot> A red bull is like 100 something mg 
[09:39:37] <JesseDesu> 80 in the small can
[09:39:42] <JesseDesu> 110 in the 12oz
[09:39:44] <MootPoot> One energy drink is about ~180-220
[09:39:47] <MootPoot> Depending on the brand 
[09:39:55] <JesseDesu> bang is 300mg
[09:39:55] <MootPoot> One cup of coffee is about the same 
[09:39:59] <MootPoot> 180-220
[09:40:01] <JesseDesu> its my goto
[09:40:02] <Cryowolf> most energy drinks are 32mg/100ml
[09:40:03] <MootPoot> Is it?
[09:40:19] <JesseDesu> if you drink the whole can
[09:40:30] <JesseDesu> no one ever said you have to drink the whole can
[09:40:35] <JesseDesu> but i do anyways
[09:40:39] <MootPoot> Is bang sugar free
[09:40:45] <MootPoot> I don't pay attention to it 
[09:40:46] <JesseDesu> i dont think so
[09:40:49] <JesseDesu> its sweet asf
[09:40:51] <MootPoot> I usually go for monster ultra
[09:40:58] <MootPoot> Or rockstar 0 cal 
[09:41:10] <JesseDesu> i like monster super dry
[09:41:11] <Cryowolf> the problem with cans is they cant be easily resealed without buying your own can cork
[09:41:18] <JesseDesu> this one liquor store is the only place that has it
[09:41:21] <Cryowolf> so they go flat
[09:41:21] <amigojapan> Sugar also causes a hit in energy levels
[09:41:50] <JesseDesu> i pour my energy drinks into a mug to fizz it out
[09:42:00] <JesseDesu> i pour it from a high distance
[09:42:09] <JesseDesu> so it bubbles
[09:42:24] <JesseDesu> i enjoy fizz but it makes it hard to drink fast
[09:42:37] <JesseDesu> and when i wake up with 20 minutes left before work i cant waste any time
[09:43:04] <amigojapan> I don't mind much wether it is fizzy or not
[09:43:20] <JesseDesu> some people cant handle fizz

[12:00:24] <DunceCotus> human for bush but he was too president

[12:05:15] <Sadale> The traffic of India are weird as well. I've heard that there's barely any traffic control measures like traffic light and stuffs.
[12:05:31] <MootPoot> deathmatch traffic
[12:05:46] <Nanobot> I'm annoyed that Amelia Watson still hasn't collabed with Rikka from Holostars.

[12:06:28] <MootPoot> both literbikes?

[12:07:11] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea the 1290 super duke gt and the gtr1400
[12:07:32] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: yeah, there's even j-drama of it. That's how I know it first.
[12:07:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I don't think so in my case. I think it was just a bad dream
[12:08:03] <MootPoot> Big pp bikes

[12:09:08] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: have you checked out Keanu Reeves's custom bikes? I think you're loaded enough to buy one.
[12:09:20] <JesseDesu> honda cbr600f4i and triumph daytona 675
[12:09:31] <MootPoot> Woah
[12:09:32] <JesseDesu> also had honda hawk nt650
[12:09:43] <MootPoot> No literbikes?

[12:10:03] <Sadale> I wonder if using motorcycles is any good here with all those transits around :/

[12:16:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, transit would cost <$100 here per month. $6000 would be 5 months of transit. I haven't even counted the maintenance cost of the bike like fuel and shit. With maintenance cost, it'd never break-even.
[12:17:25] <Sadale> I could just stick anime stickers in my home

[12:19:59] <Sadale> actually that isn't a problem here. Almost all places here are close to a metro station.

[12:20:11] <Sadale> Or if you're less lucky, it'd be close to a bus station.

[12:44:43] <MootPoot> :P
[12:44:45] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[12:45:13] <Sadale> Making profit per-se is ok. Making profit off exploiting the users isn't.
[12:45:27] <HubertFarnsworth> unfortunately MootPoot, in real life, love isn't unconditional :(
[12:46:17] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: yeah, they should charge people for social networking sites
[12:46:25] <Sadale> And that's what discord is doing as it's mining data, requiring some users to provide phone number, etc. I mean, if I were doing stuffs for-profit, I'd do the same. :(
[12:46:48] <MootPoot> You'd need to prove that they mine data for profit 
[12:47:07] <Sadale> More like, how do you disprove that?
[12:47:12] <MootPoot> You seem to corellate any data collection with for profit mining 
[12:47:19] <MootPoot> Sadale: you're making the claim, you prove it 
[12:47:34] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I heard all the shit Facebook does on a single profile is for something like 13 usd or so. From John Oliver's show.
[12:47:49] <Sadale> I mean it makes sense to sell data from commercial point of view. And selling data is profitable.
[12:47:58] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, wow. $13 is a lot.
[12:48:02] <MootPoot> That is not proof....

[12:48:44] <Sadale> I'd have to join their company or somehow get the inner knowledge on stuffs.
[12:48:55] <Sadale> Anyway I've worked on a few IoT companies. All companies collect data.
[12:49:15] <MootPoot> ^ again, same problem
[12:49:18] <Sadale> The ones that I'm working in are small enough tho. So they can't sell data for profit. But they do use data for decision making. And honestly, I find it very creepy.
[12:49:28] <MootPoot> Collecting data ‚â† mining and selling for money 
[12:49:40] <HubertFarnsworth> regardless of they selling the data or not, the problem is collecting users data
[12:49:59] <Sadale> ok. Let's assuming that they aren't selling data for money. What if whichever server storing the data got hacked by an malicious entity?
[12:50:03] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: sure, that's fine, but that is a different angle 
[12:50:26] <Sadale> Whoever hacking their data servers defo isn't bona-fide entities.
[12:50:38] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: cases like that have already happened
[12:50:40] <MootPoot> Sure 
[12:50:53] <Sadale> If there's no data collected, no problem. If there's data collected, uh oh.
[12:50:54] <MootPoot> But you just changed the argument
[12:51:00] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: Facebook couldn't exist Withought collecting some basic user data
[12:51:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, yes so what? :P
[12:51:16] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: what MootPoot is saying, you can just assume they are selling data just because data is being collected.
[12:51:22] <MootPoot> Can't
[12:51:26] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, can't*
[12:51:36] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, can't*
[12:51:39] <Sadale> To be fair tho I really have no proof at this point. 
[12:51:42] <MootPoot> But this and that are different arguments 
[12:51:52] <MootPoot> Like we KNOW fB does it 
[12:51:58] <MootPoot> I agree with you on them 
[12:52:05] <MootPoot> Do we know that discord does?
[12:52:06] <MootPoot> Nope
[12:52:12] <Sadale> Of course they won't tell us
[12:52:36] <JesseDesu> does your brain know how a brain works
[12:52:43] <JesseDesu> I DIDNT THINK SO
[12:52:53] <MootPoot> Sure, but if a platform that large does collect and sell data, like every platform of that size , it gets found out 
[12:52:58] <MootPoot> Like Facebook
[12:53:03] <MootPoot> The US govt 
[12:53:03] <DunceCotus> your brain knows how a brain knows to work
[12:53:05] <MootPoot> Etc
[12:53:12] <HubertFarnsworth> it's like just because all the swans you see are white doesn't mean there aren't any black swans << Sadale, it's like that
[12:53:27] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, hmm
[12:53:32] <JesseDesu> ultimately we all dont know things
[12:53:46] <JesseDesu> even quantum physicists
[12:53:48] <JesseDesu> dont know
[12:53:50] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: right, and sometimes the black swans are right under our noses
[12:53:51] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: sure, it seems more likely though..
[12:53:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, how do you think it'd even get found out tho?
[12:53:55] <MootPoot> All I'm saying is that dont spout stuff without proof and treat every instance as a isolated case to be hedge seperatley 
[12:54:06] <MootPoot> Sadale: same way all the others get found out 
[12:54:11] <Sadale> an insider?
[12:54:22] <MootPoot> Hacked, insider , whistleblower, legally forced, etc

[12:55:53] <Sadale> MootPoot bullies me :'(
[12:55:58] <MootPoot> You have a imouto 
[12:55:59] <HubertFarnsworth> is it true loli comes from Lolita?
[12:56:01] <MootPoot> You deserve it 
[12:56:52] <JesseDesu> stop bullying
[12:57:36] <Sadale> MootPoot, not exactly a proof. But this. "We may also share your information with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy." It doesn't say selling. It said "sharing". https://discord.com/privacy
[12:57:36] <ImoutoBot> [title] Privacy Policy | Discord
[12:57:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, it also said "The Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the ‚ÄúRelated Companies‚Äù) may also use your information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services"
[12:58:10] <HubertFarnsworth> you know who my fav loli is? Senko san.
[12:58:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, Think about what it means by "to better understand our users". creepy.
[12:58:52] <HubertFarnsworth> does discord has advertisements?
[12:58:59] <Sadale> The same document also said that the related companies can send you "marketing communications" (email?)
[12:59:04] <Sadale> you can opt-out that tho
[12:59:19] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I think not.
[12:59:50] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, anyway it isn't just discord. I find it very creepy that, very often, right after I typed something, a related ad would shows up.
[13:00:12] <MootPoot> Sadale: I know exactly what it means
[13:00:13] <Sadale> Could be the software keyboard collecting user data. Could be the app/website collecting user data. I really dunno
[13:00:15] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: no
[13:00:49] <MootPoot> its like you've worked for a comapny, you KNOW what they use the data for
[13:00:58] <MootPoot> then for  some reason you instantly forget it right after
[13:01:07] <MootPoot> and pretend your a virgin to the ways of the world
[13:01:16] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: maybe I should write a program that constantly types discord sucks into discord
[13:01:19] <HubertFarnsworth> hehe
[13:01:26] <Sadale> If you were working in the company tho you won't tell others about what the data is used for or you risk getting fired.
[13:01:33] <MootPoot> why
[13:01:36] <MootPoot> how do you know that?
[13:01:38] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, lol
[13:01:43] <MootPoot> have you read discord employment contracts?
[13:01:47] <MootPoot> do you work for them?
[13:01:49] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean, duh?
[13:01:56] <MootPoot> no?
[13:02:08] <MootPoot> last 3 companies I worked for did collect data
[13:02:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, you're saying shit against the employer that's paying you. What are you expecting?
[13:02:26] <MootPoot> and not a singel one of them had any issues wit h me telling people they collect data
[13:02:28] <MootPoot> lmao
[13:02:31] <MootPoot> you know why
[13:02:42] <Sadale> It depends on how you tell others tho. If you just talk about it. That's probably safe as long as your employer isn't in the same community as you are in.
[13:02:47] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: you're making a lot of assumptions, sure it's all tricky shit but unless and until there isn't proof, there's nothing to be done
[13:03:05] <Sadale> If you're showing proof and if you're saying that in a way that could trace to your real identity, you're screwed.
[13:03:24] <MootPoot> Sadale: there is a difference between saying "My employer collects data" vs "FUCK MY EMPLOYER THEY SPY ON YOUR KIDS AND YOUR MOM"
[13:03:37] <MootPoot> of course in the second one you'll have problems
[13:04:04] <HubertFarnsworth> true
[13:04:15] <Sadale> I mean all comapnies collect data. The thing is outsider would have no idea on what the data is used for.
[13:04:26] <Sadale> s/all/almost all/
[13:04:41] <MootPoot> if an outside has no idea what its used for, why are you, as an outsider making assumptions on what its used for?
[13:05:02] <HubertFarnsworth> yes, they have nice delicious name, cookies
[13:05:08] <MootPoot> I dont have any problem with you poking sticks at discord
[13:05:14] <MootPoot> it has its problems
[13:05:20] <MootPoot> I just want your stick to be a solid stock
[13:05:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, that's because the privacy policy allows them to sell data.
[13:05:22] <MootPoot> stick*
[13:05:25] <MootPoot> and not a hollow one
[13:05:26] <HubertFarnsworth> wait, I think I have some cheese cookies here
[13:05:54] <HubertFarnsworth> it's sugar coated cheese cookies, they sound bad but they're good
[13:05:59] <Sadale> They may not be doing that right now. But they could do that in the future.
[13:06:55] <MootPoot> then .....
[13:07:10] <MootPoot> you  might not be a murder now, but you COULD be one in the future
[13:07:18] <MootPoot> lol
[13:07:28] <Sadale> fair enough
[13:07:49] <MootPoot> you might be fair now, but you might not be in the future :P

[15:44:14] <Sapphirus> Wouldn't that still be a lot for a HKer
[15:44:29] <Sadale> emmeka, divide 10000 by 7.8
[15:44:38] <emmeka> $1200 USD, apparently. I thought HK wages were comparatively high.
[15:44:39] <Sapphirus> Using the USD conversion doesn't paint the full picture
[15:44:40] <Sadale> emmeka, That's US$1282

[15:44:58] <ImoutoBot> [title] "Duck And Cover" - original TV advert - YouTube
[15:45:21] <Sadale> Apparently the median salary here's HK$18000, which's US$2307
[15:45:59] <HubertFarnsworth> that's a lot more than I what I earn
[15:46:00] <Sapphirus> is that month or year
[15:46:04] <emmeka> Sadale the current average cost of rent in Toronto is about $1850 CAD for a 1 bedroom. That's about 11,200 HKD, looking it up.
[15:46:36] <Sadale> Sapphirus, so is that a lot? You can still survive if you're single if your job's isn't a shit-tier one. And if you're married and both couples are working, you can easily cover the living cost. If you're living with parents, and if your parents are working, you can save quite a bit of money.
[15:46:41] <Sadale> Sapphirus, that's per month.

[15:46:45] <Sapphirus> figured
[15:46:47] <Sapphirus> just making sure
[15:46:58] <Sadale> emmeka, aw
[15:47:21] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: what's totonto like? good place?
[15:47:22] <HeTo> emmeka: if you're living on your own in such an expensive city you'd be looking at a studio though, not a one-bedroom apartment. also North American cities are a bad comparison in how limited their supply of non-single-family homes is due to government policies
[15:47:30] <Sadale> emmeka, That's the rent you'd expect in major cities. >_< I think the pay there's better tho
[15:47:57] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I mean I hate it, but I also hate urban living
[15:48:03] <Sapphirus> You have a much better life in smaller towns and medium-sized cities in Canada.
[15:48:14] <Sapphirus> Although the affordability is vanishing quite fast from them
[15:48:18] <emmeka> Toronto is like the worst things about NYC and the worst things about Chicago, combined, and colder.
[15:48:35] <Sapphirus> Part of the problem is foreign buyers are allowed to purchase properties and use them as money sinks without even stepping foot in the country
[15:49:03] <Sadale> lol
[15:49:20] <emmeka> Sapphirus the virus changed a lot, people fled the big cities like no tomorrow. The amount of Torontonians coming up my way to buy houses changed the real estate market very rapidly
[15:49:23] <HubertFarnsworth> I see.
[15:49:37] <Sadale> Sapphirus, wow. That's interesting. Sounds like an option for investment to foreigners like me :P
[15:49:43] <Sapphirus> emmeka, there's truth to that, although there's also a huge amount of foreign buyers laundering money into our real estate market.
[15:49:50] <emmeka> this is also true
[15:49:54] <Sadale> Sapphirus, how much the cheapest foreigner-investable housing there?
[15:50:14] <Sadale> Anyway I suspect that the ROI of investing into housing there is rather low.
[15:50:14] <emmeka> Sadale Chinese coming and buying up our real estate to make fat stacks as landlords has been a thing for a while, especially on the west coast
[15:50:35] <Sadale> emmeka, I didn't know that one could purchase housing without even steeping foot in the country.
[15:50:39] <Sapphirus> Happening in Ontario now
[15:50:45] <emmeka> ~free market~
[15:50:52] <Sadale> lol
[15:51:16] <Sapphirus> There's literally an alibaba/amazon type website on the mainland Chinese internet for buying Canadian real estate.
[15:52:04] <Sapphirus> Not being Chinese, I wouldn't know where to look for it, but I'm sure you could find it, Sadale. 
[15:52:10] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth personally as far as cities I like Ottawa and Montr√©al better than Toronto, but, I have to admit some things about it. Toronto is the single most multicultural city on earth, over half of its population was foreign-born, and the city has a lot going for it culturally
[15:52:28] <HubertFarnsworth> nice
[15:52:49] <Sadale> Sapphirus, aw I'm not sure if I could just use those mainland Chinese website tho. The payment method they're accepting there may be a bit different from here despite that both mainland and Hong Kong are China.
[15:52:58] <HubertFarnsworth> some time back I also considered buying property in Canada actually
[15:52:59] <Sadale> Sapphirus, anyway I could look into that :3
[15:53:07] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, oh nice. How much it was?
[15:53:12] <HubertFarnsworth> but it's just damn too costly
[15:53:25] <emmeka> please don't ruin my country's housing market further, it's already broken

[15:54:19] <Sapphirus> Not in the GTA

[15:54:34] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, s/into/info

[15:55:56] <Sapphirus> That's on Lake Erie. I'm closer to Huron.
[15:56:01] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: realtor.ca and some other sites that come up in search
[15:56:15] <emmeka> realtor.ca is just the Canadian MLS service
[15:56:49] <Sapphirus> realtor.ca can be far better than a real estate agent
[15:57:05] <emmeka> it is real estate agents. it's MLS.
[15:57:22] <Sapphirus> True, although I'm talking in terms of finding something yourself.
[15:57:33] <Sapphirus> Agents are useless for that
[15:57:44] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: it was about 35000 cad
[15:57:55] <Sadale> ,c 35000 CAD in USD
[15:57:59] <emmeka> I do browse it pretty often, window-shopping
[15:58:01] <Sadale> !c 35000 CAD in USD
[15:58:02] <ImoutoBot> Sadale: I don't know.
[15:58:07] * Sadale spanks ImoutoBot :<
[15:58:18] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth what could you possibly be looking at that costs only $35k CAD
[15:58:26] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, wow. I can actually purchase that with my savings right now.
[15:58:30] <emmeka> there is nowhere in this country where a house can be purchased for that price
[15:58:35] <emmeka> try multiplying that by 10
[15:58:37] <HubertFarnsworth> it was years ago emmeka 
[15:58:46] <Sadale> oh.
[15:58:55] <HubertFarnsworth> maybe you're right emmeka 
[15:59:12] <Sadale> Now that I can't afford that after multiplying that by 10 :(
[15:59:24] <emmeka> it'd have to be like over 10 years ago, worst of recession times
[15:59:27] * Sadale suddendly becomes a poor man :'(
[15:59:30] <emmeka> which was definitely the time to buy a house
[15:59:31] <Sapphirus> Parents of mine are already in the real estate market and it's insane how much equity they've gained
[15:59:38] <Sapphirus> I don't know how it's sustainable
[15:59:39] <HubertFarnsworth> oh wait, I forgot to add zero Sadale 
[15:59:47] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, pfffft
[15:59:48] <emmeka> Sapphirus yeah I'm kind of shocked at how much it increased since I bought
[15:59:50] <HubertFarnsworth> 350000 ad
[15:59:54] <HubertFarnsworth> cad*
[15:59:57] <Sadale> lololololol
[16:00:05] <Sadale> Still cheaper than housing here tho.
[16:00:38] <emmeka> Sapphirus my equity has doubled since I bought my house 3 years ago. I own that and another 40 acres.
[16:00:51] <emmeka> which is beyond stupid, really
[16:00:59] <HubertFarnsworth> that's tough Sadale, what do old people do when they don't have income?
[16:01:03] <emmeka> it just means the market is broken
[16:01:14] <Sadale> By equity did you mean asset tho?
[16:01:25] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: same here at some places
[16:01:25] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, trolololololololololol
[16:01:39] <Sapphirus> emmeka, how are young people supposed to get into the market now without wealthy parents or inheritance?
[16:01:52] <Sapphirus> A median salary won't get you enough to buy you anything anymore
[16:02:03] <emmeka> by not living in the city, I guess. But even mid-sized cities are getting beyond affordable now.
[16:02:05] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, technically we've got public housing here, which's rented at a far lower rate. But it's only for poor people that barely has any assets. And it takes a few years for you to get assigned an apartment.
[16:02:17] <emmeka> up here there is still affordable housing, but the prices are rising fast
[16:02:27] <Sapphirus> emmeka, even small towns within proximity to those medium-sized cities are priced almost identically.
[16:02:33] <Sapphirus> there's no escaping it
[16:02:39] <emmeka> well yeah, they've become exurbs
[16:02:41] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, and the government is offering subsidy for poor people as well.
[16:02:45] <HubertFarnsworth> these days the market is so broken that normal people can't afford independent house here
[16:02:49] <emmeka> you have to go out to the real sticks to get cheap housing
[16:03:13] <Sapphirus> then there's no jobs unless you work remotely and .. then internet access lol
[16:03:16] <Sadale> I think it's not just housing. The entire market's broken
[16:03:22] <emmeka> Sadale tbf, $350k won't buy you a house in a major city, but it might buy you one in a smaller city here.
[16:03:31] <Sadale> emmeka, ah. makes sense
[16:03:34] <emmeka> Sadale a condo in Toronto would run you over $1 mil.
[16:03:45] <Sadale> emmeka, that sounds about right lol
[16:03:53] <Sadale> emmeka, That's even more expensive than condo here.
[16:03:58] <Sapphirus> A house in London or Waterloo will run you between $700k-$1mil
[16:04:03] *** Quits: m4 (~aaa@user/aaa) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:04:20] <emmeka> and who wants to buy a house in London?! rust belt town that also has annoying university kids
[16:04:25] <Sadale> emmeka, anyway HK is huge. So in some places, the condo would be more than $1mil. But in some other places, that'd be sub-1mil
[16:04:26] <JesseDesu> a condo will run you over.
[16:04:31] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: it's better for me to just live here :|
[16:04:45] <Sadale> Brexit.
[16:04:49] <Sapphirus> emmeka, retiring boomers leaving the GTA is who
[16:04:52] <Sadale> London's dead
[16:04:58] <emmeka> Sadale wrong London :P
[16:05:01] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, ouch :(
[16:05:02] <emmeka> London, Ontario, he means
[16:05:10] <Sadale> emmeka, oh. There's a London inside Canada. wow.
[16:05:11] <Sapphirus> 2nd best london :P
[16:05:13] <emmeka> a city of 100k inbetween Detroit and Toronto
[16:05:20] <Sapphirus> actually it's far more than that now
[16:05:31] <Sadale> What a confusing name. At least call it new London please
[16:05:34] <emmeka> is it? it's been like a decade since I was down that way
[16:05:36] <Sapphirus> middlesex-london has the same population as waterloo
[16:05:38] <Sadale> Whoever called it London's an idiot :P
[16:05:38] <Sapphirus> 500k
[16:05:47] <Sadale> I mean whoever coined it London's an idiot.
[16:05:56] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: well, it might not be so bad. I will either live here in city or move to country side
[16:06:00] <Sadale> Is that 500k CAD or USD?

[16:07:13] <emmeka> jesus, London's census area population is 474k
[16:07:14] <Sapphirus> but it was controversial after the first world war, iirc
[16:07:15] <Sapphirus> so they changed it
[16:07:26] <emmeka> Sadale yeah, Kitchener used to be named Berlin
[16:07:26] <Sapphirus> emmeka, yeah
[16:07:34] <HubertFarnsworth> I probably could, yeah
[16:07:35] <Sadale> Just tell them that "hey dude I'm no longer interested in partnering with you. I'm getting out of here! Fuck you! :P"
[16:07:39] <emmeka> as Sapphirus points out, during WW2 this wasn't taken very well
[16:07:42] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[16:07:42] <emmeka> so they changed it
[16:07:47] <Sadale> emmeka, ouch
[16:08:42] <HubertFarnsworth> the places in UK has interesting history, actually it's a total mess with all cultures from Norwegian, Welsh, English..
[16:08:57] <emmeka> Sadale there's a town near me named Swastika. It was settled and named that decades before the war, and people there are very stubborn about their town's name and its legitimacy. During WW2 they hung an effigy of Hitler by a noose from the town sign to prove their loyalty

[16:10:11] <HubertFarnsworth> isn't that like Irish emmeka?
[16:10:22] <Sadale> I mean swastika is used for buddhists and hindu in Asia.
[16:10:24] <HubertFarnsworth> I'm not sure
[16:10:27] <Sadale> Hitler just stole it :P
[16:10:31] <Sapphirus> that's true
[16:10:45] <Sadale> damn I want to post the manji here but I can't xD
[16:10:52] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth nah. the swastika was just a good luck charm of India, the founder of that town and the associated gold mine just wanted to name the town after a good luck charm
[16:10:57] <Sadale> amigojapa n hmph! :P
[16:10:59] <emmeka> he thought it suited a gold mining town
[16:11:19] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: actually the hindu nationalists here during Hitler times were pro-nazi
[16:11:25] <HubertFarnsworth> think about that
[16:11:31] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I see.
[16:11:47] <Sadale> People think that nazi's bad because they lose the war and now everyone's calling them bad.
[16:11:51] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: they even went and fought for SS
[16:11:53] <isekaijin> Sadale: So, I read the first few chapters of the S-Rank Behemoth manga ~~instead of doing work~~.

[16:11:59] <Sadale> isekaijin, lol
[16:12:03] <Sadale> isekaijin, indeed :3
[16:12:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: Nazi is bad! they are facists
[16:12:22] <emmeka> Sadale well people think they're bad because they committed war crimes and genocide on industrial scales
[16:12:24] <Sadale> well, I don't comment on if it's bad or not. I mean each country has their own problem
[16:12:39] <Sadale> like the workers in the US having terrible working conditions.
[16:12:54] <emmeka> I find it kind of interesting the way Asian societies deal with Hitler in history though. They don't really care as much.
[16:13:08] <Sadale> Imagine if Nazi had won the war. The people around the world would no longer call it bad.
[16:13:16] <Sadale> Not that I'm pro nazi. I'm neutral on this one.
[16:13:25] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: we like to bang our own drums, at least my country
[16:14:00] <emmeka> to us, the nazis are the bad guys ne plus ultra, but to you they're just some long gone historical force that don't need to be opposed.
[16:14:00] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: and also the people here associate themselves as aryans so that also kind of worked towards pro-nazi I think
[16:14:01] <isekaijin> Sadale: Mmm, Germany had a right to try to recover what she lost in Versailles, but let's agree that genocide is bad, okay?
[16:14:15] <JesseDesu> Pronazi, the next generation antidepressant
[16:14:19] <Sadale> isekaijin, ok.
[16:14:32] <emmeka> Sadale in the west your position would be seen as apologist
[16:14:36] <Sadale> The hate towards Nazi in western world has reminded me of the hate towards Japanese here. Japanese had kill quite a bit of people in Asia back in WW2. It causes the older generate just hate Japanese
[16:14:50] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: the history books here portray the british as bigger bad, I don't clearly remember though
[16:14:55] <Sadale> s/older generate/older generation/
[16:14:58] <Sadale> emmeka, what's an apologist?
[16:15:00] <Sapphirus> Japanese were put in interment camps here during ww 2
[16:15:01] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth fair, though
[16:15:08] <HubertFarnsworth> but I love the british, I love everything about british emmeka 
[16:15:17] <HubertFarnsworth> I'm an anglophile
[16:15:19] <Sapphirus> they didn't even break the law or anything
[16:15:25] <Sadale> Anyway I do agree that killing Jews are bad. However, what I'm suspecting is that Nazi isn't the only one who's doing this shit.
[16:15:33] <emmeka> Sadale someone who defends something usually viewed negatively
[16:15:36] <Sadale> Just like how the Japanese were killing Asian in mass during war.
[16:15:36] <Sapphirus> We just decided "All japs are bad, time to go to camps."
[16:15:55] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth including their propensity for genocide and cruelty?
[16:15:59] <Sapphirus> It's a real dark stain on our history. We like to throw shade on the Germans yet in a lot of ways we weren't any better.
[16:16:13] <Sadale> And like how native American were killed in mass back when they were colonized.
[16:16:17] <isekaijin> emmeka: In this regard, these days people have bought too much into their own lies, but let's recall that Hitler's actual ‚Äúcrime‚Äù, that which actually prompted the declaration of war from the UK and France, was the offensive into Poland. In other words, not accepting the outcome of Versailles.
[16:16:32] <Sapphirus> Even tested weapons and shit poisoning our own populations. Radiation got into our milk supply for awhile in the 20th century
[16:16:47] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: nah, I don't like those blighters
[16:16:59] <JesseDesu> why do we always talk about deep shit when emmeka is around
[16:17:02] <Sapphirus> Not sure if it got into Canada's but it did for sure get into the US supply.
[16:17:14] <Sadale> You know what's the funny thing? Out of all Japanese, Nazi, genocide of native american, only symbols of Nazi is widely prohibited in western world.
[16:17:52] <emmeka> isekaijin Versailles didn't partition Poland. Poland was a separate treaty, or some shit.
[16:17:54] <Sapphirus> Association will eventually be forgotten, but probably not in our lifetimes.
[16:18:03] <isekaijin> Sadale: In the 19th century, those who were known for killing Jews regularly, every now and then, and for no particular reason were the East Slavs with their pogroms.
[16:18:33] <Sadale> isekaijin, sad :(
[16:18:41] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, funny story, I'm technically an ethnic minority despite being white.
[16:18:44] <emmeka> Sadale it's just a difference in cultural historiography. In the west, Hitler is the ultimate evil and the nazis are the darkest chapter in human history and every single upstanding person must oppose them.

[16:21:34] <Sadale> I don't like how something just got banned, and something that's equally evil would just get away.
[16:22:00] <HubertFarnsworth> because people don't know shit
[16:22:04] <Sadale> well, this world's indeed broken. :<
[16:22:31] <emmeka> Sadale the problem is you're talking into a modern political struggle there.
[16:22:32] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: they don't know the civil war is about their rights to keep slaves
[16:22:41] <emmeka> Sadale my family was in the residential schools, fwiw

[16:23:29] <emmeka> the last of them closed in the 90s, after I was born. You're talking about a genocide 1 generation removed, and a racist system that still exists.
[16:23:30] <Sadale> I guess it's rather peaceful there.
[16:23:42] <HubertFarnsworth> I hardly talk to them about anything other than business related
[16:23:54] <Sadale> That's rather sad. Anyway racist's everywhere. :(
[16:24:02] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth capitalist
[16:24:27] <HubertFarnsworth> capitalist? I'd say dysfunctional family
[16:24:27] <emmeka> Sadale there's currently a large political movement here about it, since they found the mass graves...
[16:24:39] <Sapphirus> emmeka, even though I had no part in that horrid system nor my family, my condolences are offered to you. 
[16:24:41] *** Joins: Berlin36 (~Berlin36@178.168.92.149)
[16:24:45] <Sadale> emmeka, I know. I've heard of it.
[16:24:45] <emmeka> thousands of children's bodies piled in unmarked pits
[16:25:37] <Sapphirus> This country literally committed a genocide and still hasn't fully recognised it yet. WE have very little moral authority on the world stage on this topic
[16:25:52] <HubertFarnsworth> I never hated anyone though. I don't hate Pakistan too.
[16:25:54] <Sadale> emmeka, It isn't surprising to me tho. I suspect that shit like this happens everywhere. And whoever responsible would just try to cover that up. :(
[16:26:00] <emmeka> Sapphirus the best part is this. My grandfather was in a residential school in Labrador, post-confederation. The Canadian government disputed that it was responsible for reparations to victims of the Labrador ones for years and years, and denied recompensation payments to people like my grandfather
[16:26:09] <emmeka> he died a year before that court case was settled
[16:26:13] <HubertFarnsworth> If I express that aloud, I probably get weird looks
[16:26:17] <Sadale> emmeka, as for nazi, they can't cover it up because they lose the war. So all of their wrong-doing got exposed.
[16:26:18] <Sapphirus> emmeka, that's such a disgrace.
[16:26:22] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't hate China either
[16:27:03] <Sadale> emmeka, aww. I'm sorry to hear about your grandfather. :(
[16:27:20] <Sapphirus> I don't believe Trudeau nor do I take his word on indigenous matters given his track record so far.
[16:27:22] <HubertFarnsworth> ouch emmeka 
[16:27:42] <emmeka> now I'm just here, the byproduct of a successful genocide. it gets me a bit sometimes.
[16:27:51] <HubertFarnsworth> damn emmeka 
[16:28:02] <Sapphirus> JWR and then how he tries to shift the blame on the Catholic church to abstain responsibility
[16:28:12] <Sadale> emmeka, allow me to joke for a bit if you don't mind. Had he lived for a year longer he could get the money, which you'd be able to take as inheritance. :P
[16:28:22] <Sapphirus> How about taking some responsibility for what the government did in the past instead of passing the buck?
[16:29:08] <Sapphirus> It's disgusting, really. A few churches got burnt down that were community hubs for these same people hurting.
[16:29:16] <Sapphirus> Trudeau is accountable for that
[16:29:20] <HubertFarnsworth> why do our conversations always end on sad note?
[16:29:22] <emmeka> wanna know what my grandfather left behind as inheritance. it's pretty hilarious. A 1998 Buick Century with a stash of 80s pornos mags in the trunk.
[16:29:23] <emmeka> that was it
[16:29:34] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[16:29:36] <Sadale> Perhaps it's Russia who secretly made the mass grave to divide the people in Canada. :P
[16:29:45] <emmeka> he was otherwise dead broke
[16:29:45] <Sapphirus> But nobody will hold him to account at the ballot box for it, because they are about as shallow as the virtuous image he portrays.
[16:29:49] <Sadale> emmeka, lol pornmags xD
[16:29:58] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: you still have those porno mags?
[16:30:15] <emmeka> my stepfather has them. he framed one and hung it up in his shop. family shrine, if you will.
[16:30:48] <Sapphirus> What's happened over the last year has made me the least patriotic in my life.
[16:30:52] <HubertFarnsworth> 80s were wild, weren't they? they were procreate more than the 90s people
[16:30:53] <Sadale> actually I suspect that countries like Russia could be creating divide among people in western world. Now that we've got social media and shit. It wouldn't be that difficult for them to get people to burn down shit in Canada.
[16:31:27] <Sapphirus> Sadale, nah, it was Trudeau blaming the Church to sideline accountability for the mass graves.

[16:32:16] <Sapphirus> Some of these churches were actually built by indigenous folks.
[16:32:35] <HubertFarnsworth> that's enough dicking around, I get back to reading
[16:32:38] <Sapphirus> and were community hubs, for these people with wounds upened right back up.
[16:32:38] <emmeka> tbf, the church is entirely complicit and hiding shit
[16:32:39] <Sadale> I dunno. I actually have no proof. Just a hypothesis.
[16:32:44] <HubertFarnsworth> toodle-o
[16:32:54] <emmeka> the Catholics flew all residential school documents out of the country to Rome to cover their asses
[16:33:06] <Sapphirus> Sadale, I don't buy that Russia narrative. I think it's a complete scapegoat.
[16:33:17] <Sadale> I see :3
[16:33:27] <emmeka> the feds are of course trying to do everything in their power to avoid admitting that they committed genocide
[16:33:49] <Sapphirus> Justin Trudeau blamed the Church and then some vigilantist activists started burning churches down
[16:33:54] <emmeka> "yeah we did medical experiments on children and had schools with higher death rates than the median Nazi concentration camp, but..."
[16:34:01] <emmeka> Sapphirus good, tbh
[16:34:32] <emmeka> in my hometown someone vandalized the Catholic church. They had a big sign up that said "abortion stops a beating heart". someone crossed out the word "abortion" and wrote "residential school"
[16:34:38] <emmeka> more pertinent, really
[16:34:47] <Sapphirus> I don't think it's good given he successfully deflected responsibility from the government, yet again
[16:35:01] <Sadale> emmeka, Imagine if Canada was in a major world war and lose it. Then perhaps the symbol of Canada'd be banned, just like Nazi.
[16:35:08] <Sapphirus> Apologies offered during the Harper era are now nothing but mere words
[16:35:14] <Sadale> "It's a genocide. It's bad!"
[16:35:16] <emmeka> look if we play into their game of trying to shift the blame we'll be stuck forever, both of them are entirely culpable
[16:35:32] <emmeka> the feds, the churches, the NGOs and charities...
[16:35:44] <Sapphirus> Oh they are, but I don't think playing these blame games actually accomplishes anything. Pushes the buck down the road further, rather

[16:36:07] <Sadale> sad. It's human nature. Human exploiting human. Human blaming human.
[16:36:18] <Sapphirus> It's all in an effort to not take responsibility and the Church won't even take responsibility.
[16:36:28] <Sadale> Just like the corporate world. Companies blaming each others when shit happens.
[16:36:33] <emmeka> Sapphirus really we've barely scratched the surface, the residential schools are one genocide among many
[16:36:50] <Sapphirus> So it's easy for the government to point its fingers at the church
[16:37:01] <Sadale> I mean taking responsibility wouldn't do whoever taking it any good at all :(

[16:37:11] <emmeka> how many died then...
[16:37:17] <Sapphirus> emmeka, yeah, and that's the sad part. I don't think we'll ever know the extent.
[16:37:28] <Sapphirus> History will be whitewashed
[16:38:01] <Sapphirus> Trudeau is helping that process along and it's thoroughly disgusting to watch.
[16:38:01] <Sadale> history is what people tells you happened.
[16:38:35] <Sadale> Anyway how can you prove that it's the government and not that churches? Just wondering.

[16:39:32] <Sadale> I'd just stop caring whatever's happening in this world. This world's fucked up everywhere. xD
[16:39:37] <Sapphirus> Doesn't know what it stands for half the time and can't take accountability for its history
[16:39:46] <Sapphirus> Housing market is screwed, etc. and the list goes on
[16:39:48] <emmeka> Sadale basically residential school attendance was mandatory, if you didn't send your kids, you were denied food and denied permission to leave the Indian reservation. The government mandated attendance and collected the kids and did all sorts of terrible shit to them, but most the feds didn't directly run the schools
[16:39:59] <emmeka> the feds contracted out the running of residential schools to churches
[16:40:15] <emmeka> the most prolific of them being the Catholic church, but there were also many protestant ones.
[16:40:17] <Sadale> emmeka, ah.
[16:40:27] <Sadale> emmeka, I wouldn't be surprised if something equivalent had happened in the US
[16:40:35] <Sapphirus> I think catholic school systems shouldn't be funded by tax dollars
[16:40:40] <emmeka> also some secular ones from organizations that were nominally charities or run by various civil organizations
[16:40:46] <emmeka> it was a society-wide effort
[16:41:02] <emmeka> Sadale the US did it too but oddly wasn't as kill-y as ours
[16:41:13] <Sadale> emmeka, or they didn't get caught :P
[16:41:18] <Sapphirus> U.S. also stopped long before us
[16:41:19] <Sadale> Maybe they've burned the bodies :P
[16:41:26] <emmeka> right, they didn't keep it up as long
[16:41:41] <Sapphirus> We kept on going right up until the late 90s
[16:41:46] <emmeka> the residential schools here persisted in full strength into the 1960s and the last of them closed in the 90s
[16:42:02] <Sadale> ah. That's surprisingly recent
[16:43:20] <emmeka> yeah. my grandfather was a boomer, not that old. he was only in his 60s when he died.
[16:43:37] <Sadale> wow. Short live

[17:06:16] <Sadale> Sapphirus, if you just want to have fun learning a language, consider toki pona. It's a tiny language with only ~130 words. Mostly for fun. :3
[17:06:45] <Sadale> And there's a few small online communities using it. It's also the second most used constructed language in the internet, only after Esperanto.
[17:07:51] <JesseDesu> eskimos have 130 words for different kinds of snow
[17:08:09] <Sadale> It took me a month to learn it. Some people take less time to learn that. It takes about 30 hours to get to the point that you can chat with others in written form. Since there's no extra vocabulary, you can mostly understand what other people are talking about. :3

[17:08:32] <Sadale> Just 50 :P
[17:08:50] <JesseDesu> i was exaggerating to match
[17:09:40] <emmeka> JesseDesu that's a myth, and also, "eskimo" is considered offensive.
[17:09:55] <JesseDesu> oh
[17:10:00] <JesseDesu> pardon my french
[17:10:00] <Sadale> huh? Why's that offensive? :O
[17:10:22] <Sadale> I thought that it was just a word for a certain race of people
[17:10:54] <JesseDesu> like trump saying china virus
[17:11:10] <Sadale> Some people consider Eskimo offensive, because it is popularly perceived to mean[25][32][34][35] "eaters of raw meat" in Algonquian languages common to people along the Atlantic coast.[27][36][37] An unnamed Cree speaker suggested the original word that became corrupted to Eskimo might have been askamiciw (meaning "he eats it raw"); the Inuit are referred to in some Cree texts as askipiw (meaning "eats something raw").[36][37][38][39][3][37][40] Regardless, 
[17:11:10] <Sadale> the term still carries a derogatory connotation for many Inuit and Yupik.[27][36][41][42][43]
[17:11:15] <emmeka> Sadale well it's an exonym, it's the word used by the Cree, and it means like "raw meat eaters" or some shit. The self-applied label is "Inuit".
[17:11:16] <HeTo> some Inuit activists consider it offensive, I don't think other Eskimos do
[17:11:23] <Sadale> I see. That's the etymology.
[17:11:39] <emmeka> it's a bit confusing. in Alaska, the word is used more commonly
[17:11:43] <Sadale> I think it's kind of like how we refer to westerner. We literally call them ghostmen.
[17:11:46] <HeTo> emmeka: Eskimos applies to a larger group of people than Inuit
[17:11:51] <emmeka> but on this side of the border it's considered a bit racist
[17:11:55] <emmeka> HeTo in Alaska, it does.
[17:11:58] <emmeka> here, it does not.
[17:12:05] <emmeka> and using the term will make people mad at you.
[17:12:37] <Sadale> fair enough. I'll try avoid using this word.
[17:12:41] <JesseDesu> i've come to realize that everyone is wrong about something
[17:12:43] <Sadale> damn. How many words we still have to ban? :/
[17:13:04] <emmeka> well I'm not gonna ban anyone from using it especially given the ambiguous nature of it, I'm just letting you know
[17:13:37] <JesseDesu> emmeka, when you educate someone too much it becomes offensive
[17:13:40] <JesseDesu> thats like
[17:13:46] <JesseDesu> mansplaining
[17:13:54] <Sadale> oh. I mean like "how many words we have to avoid using to keep everyone happy"
[17:13:58] <JesseDesu> it comes off wrong
[17:14:09] <HeTo> emmeka: well, surely if you are talking about Yupiks, even if they don't live in Canada and you do, it'd be offensive to call them Inuit
[17:14:35] <emmeka> HeTo the concept of "eskimos" as a united group in Alaska is something that only exists in the minds of white ppl anyway
[17:15:08] <emmeka> Yupik and Inupiat don't view themselves as the same
[17:17:12] <emmeka> HeTo it gets weird because technically Yupik are closer related to Aleutians than to Inupiat, but for some reason Aleutians are their own group and aren't considered "eskimos" and yet Yupik/Inupiat together are.
[17:18:48] <Berlin36> btw
[17:18:57] <Sadale> That's not surprising tho. When there's a group of people you're unfamiliar with and you barely interact with, you just group them into one.
[17:19:00] <Berlin36> is it okay to host an ssh connection in tor?
[17:19:08] <Berlin36> like a special hidden service for ssh
[17:19:20] <Sadale> What did you mean by "ok"?
[17:19:33] <Berlin36> you asking me? 
[17:19:36] <emmeka> JesseDesu I'm sorry that explaining pejoratives used against my own race bothers you because you might have to listen and learn something, if you'd rather proceed with just saying something ignorant of the meaning of the words you're using, ignore me.
[17:19:39] <HeTo> > Despite the ICC's 1977 decision to adopt the term Inuit, this was never accepted by the Yupik and others as they are proud of the term Eskimo.
[17:20:02] <Sadale> Berlin36, I haven't tried that. I suppose that it should work. But if you're talking about if it's safe, I'm not so sure. And as for if it's legal, it depends on where you're living in.
[17:20:24] <Berlin36> it works, idk if it's legal, but is it secure lol
[17:20:27] <HeTo> anyway, if you can be more precise and talk about Inuit and Yupik, that sounds like a good idea
[17:20:32] <Berlin36> i mean, it should be secure
[17:20:42] <HeTo> as in, whichever you are talking about
[17:20:42] <Sadale> Supposedly, it shouldn't be less secure than clearnet SSH
[17:20:47] <Berlin36> this way i can connect from anywhere i want 
[17:20:51] <emmeka> HeTo yeah. but a lot has changed since the 70s. even Alaskans are hesitant about the term now.
[17:21:10] <JesseDesu> emmeka, you got me, i'm not gonna use the word eskimo EVER AGAIN
[17:21:16] <Sadale> Berlin36, Just don't use password authorization and disable root login tho. Use public key auth. Disable password auth.
[17:21:22] <emmeka> same way there used to be an embrace of the term "Indian" ie by the American Indian Movement
[17:21:29] <Sadale> Berlin36, and only allow login to specific users.
[17:21:49] <HeTo> but if you just remember that Eskimo is a bad word and merely substitute Inuit, that might make things worse if you don't know whom you are talking about
[17:22:10] <Berlin36> oh, why disable pass auth
[17:22:18] <JesseDesu> emmeka i was just thinking in general, because today i realized that my boss has called me wrong one too many times
[17:22:21] <emmeka> turns out randomly grouping wholly different peoples together can cause problems and offend, who knew
[17:22:22] <Sadale> oh wait. emmeka so you're considered an "eskimo" (I mean no offense. But this word sounds cool to me) :O
[17:22:39] <Sadale> Berlin36, that's because password auth can be brute-forced relatively easily
[17:22:40] <JesseDesu> and to be called wrong on the internet just adds salt
[17:22:59] <Berlin36> Sadale: i can make a limit and then ban in case there are X wrong attempts
[17:23:03] <Sadale> Berlin36, By disabling password auth, I mean just disable it over SSH. It's ok to use password auth locally.
[17:23:04] <emmeka> Sadale I'm only half blooded, but yeah. My maternal grandparents are from what's now Nunatsiavut.
[17:23:07] <Sadale> Berlin36, that works too. Up to you

[17:23:26] <Sadale> Berlin36, I still recommend public key auth tho :P
[17:23:31] <HeTo> emmeka: AFAIK Indians (i.e. those with roots in America) still prefer to be called Indian, at least those ones CGP Grey spoke to
[17:23:35] <Berlin36> okay Sadale 
[17:23:41] <Sadale> emmeka, cool! That's fascinating to me. :3
[17:23:43] <Berlin36> gonna dive into that
[17:24:21] <emmeka> HeTo it's a bit more complicated. Lots of indigenous ppl self-identify as Indian, and use the word Indian amongst themselves, but also think white people using the word is racist
[17:24:34] <emmeka> I mean you can see parallels with the n-word, for example

[17:25:18] <emmeka> then there are people, especially older people, who outright uphold the term. But most people, especially here and to a degree in the USA as well, now prefer to just be called by their actual nation
[17:25:24] <HeTo> it's not just about using it themselves
[17:25:29] <emmeka> Native American is kind of a constructed fake term
[17:25:35] <emmeka> there are other options
[17:26:39] <emmeka> I mean fundamentally there is no such thing as an Indian or Native American outside of a political category. In reality these people are many different nations, and identify with their own nation.
[17:28:13] <HeTo> there are lots of nations in Europe as well, but there's no problem with having the word European
[17:28:35] <Sadale> Maybe European people were never being exploited?
[17:28:42] <HeTo> Sadale: lol
[17:28:44] <Sadale> And they had been in power in the recent history?
[17:28:47] <Sadale> s/had/has/
[17:29:21] <HeTo> although nation in Europe is very different from the pre-state nations of North America
[17:29:35] <HeTo> and most nations in Europe are less than 200 years old anyway
[17:29:50] <Sadale> I dunno. I have a feeling that the modern human history is mostly shaped by European and North American. And guess where the NA people came from? It's the Europe.

[18:20:12] <Bco1981> i did too, but now i have used it several times and only had... difficulty activating a office, once.
[18:20:32] <isekaijin> Another possibility would be buying a MacBook Pro. I'm a sucker for pretty things, so if I'm going to spend a lot of money, I better at least get a pretty (though overpriced) computer.

[18:38:10] <Sadale> isekaijin, I think you could just use linux subsystem of windows?
[18:38:27] <amigojapan> Hi isekaijin darkwitch Urchin[emacs] and HeTo 
[18:38:48] <isekaijin> I see. I know nothing about X internals. What I know is that I still want to run programs on a system that I am comfortable with (GNU/Linux), and show them on Zoom (which would be running on Windows).
[18:38:48] <Sadale> oh never mind. You just want to show an remote X program on a Windows machine
[18:38:49] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Hello.
[18:38:51] <HeTo> I haven't looked into the newest developments with wslg but that should get you some way of showing X applications indeed
[18:39:35] <Sadale> With WSL I think you can pretty much do almost whatever you want on Windows that could be done in linux
[18:39:39] <HeTo> Xming is an older option. Cygwin also has an X server, but you have to install the whole Cygwin environment
[18:39:45] <amigojapan> HeTo: showing X applications on the web?
[18:40:21] <isekaijin> Sadale: I have two main PCs, called i9 and i7. The former has all the fancy programs that I can only install in one machine, especially Mathematica. But the latter runs Zoom. (Because I don't want to sacrifice my best PC for work.) So, from i7, I SSH into i9 and run Mathematica.
[18:40:35] <HeTo> amigojapan: well, it's true that if isekaijin just wants to share some application window on Zoom there could be a simpler way to just do that on Linux
[18:40:47] <Sadale> isekaijin, wait. Are i7 and i9 the CPU models? You rich! :O
[18:40:59] <isekaijin> lol I'm not rich
[18:41:23] *** Joins: treble (~treble@user/treble)
[18:41:24] <HeTo> doesn't Zoom run in a browser? I think nowadays browsers have ways for a web app to request screen sharing
[18:41:46] <isekaijin> Does it work well enough when you are the meeting host?
[18:41:56] <Bco1981> i have heard that screen sharing does not work well in linux yet.
[18:42:07] <Bco1981> teams, zoom, discord.
[18:42:15] <amigojapan> HeTo: I don't think you will get sound with X tunneling
[18:42:24] <Sadale> isekaijin, as for your problem tho, if you couldn't find another way to do that, try using WSL and install all linux stuffs on the i7. Install X inside WSL. Then use the SSH inside i7 to connect with the i9 with X forwarding. I haven't tried that. But I guess it should work(?)
[18:42:53] <isekaijin> Bco1981: Screen sharing itself works fine. But, Zoom likes to open and close lots of windows when you move from one breakout room to another.
[18:43:03] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it works on Skype
[18:43:04] <isekaijin> And opening and closing lots of windows does not play nicely with tiling window managers.
[18:43:34] <isekaijin> Because it totally fucks up my window order, which I rely on to cycle through windows comfortably.

[20:42:31] <JesseDesu> why do people even use computers
[20:42:36] <JesseDesu> what is the point
[20:42:47] <isekaijin> JesseDesu: Didn't you buy an iPad recently?
[20:43:02] <isekaijin> Who do you think makes the software that you run on your iPad
[20:43:03] <isekaijin> ?
[20:43:11] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/l-emacs/l-emacs-ltr.pdf I usually recommend this as a gentle intro to Emacs, bit old, but still relevant

[20:43:17] <JesseDesu> who is even listening
[20:43:52] <isekaijin> Satin: I think Emacs' main attraction is that you can turn it into the IDE of your liking.
[20:43:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: the good thing about Emacs is that it's essentially a Lisp interpreter configured to run as a text editor by default
[20:44:06] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: you can directly reprogram Emacs while using it
[20:44:18] <isekaijin> Satin: And, unlike most Java IDEs (or Visual Studio), it comes with less preconceived notions.
[20:44:29] *** Quits: oycp (~pcyo@user/pcyo) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[20:44:30] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: and it has a ton of apps running on it (like I'm running an IRC client)
[20:44:45] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[20:44:49] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: also has a pretty good C-mode
[20:45:21] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: and, obviously, pretty good support for Lisp (be it Emacs Lisp, Scheme, Common Lisp or Clojure)
[20:45:22] <isekaijin> Also, Emacs is configured in a language that is less shit than VimScript.
[20:45:37] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu | Episode: 10
[20:46:11] <Urchin[emacs]> Emacs Lisp occasionally gets successfully misused for things it wasn't intended for, like critical part of an air traffic control system
[20:46:16] <HeTo> you can get IDE-like code completion features etc. in vim too, not just emacs
[20:46:24] <Urchin[emacs]> (that was Germany)
[20:46:45] <HeTo> and there is a file manager for vim as well, although personally I prefer using a good separate file manager to integrating a crappy one in my editor
[20:47:22] <Urchin[emacs]> I mostly do my file management through the basic shell tools, so don't care much about file managers to begin with
[20:47:47] <HeTo> note that if you use gvim you can drag and drop files from a file manager to a vim window in order to edit it
[20:48:01] *** Joins: treble (~treble@user/treble)
[20:48:04] <Urchin[emacs]> but, yeah, I'd say Emacs works very well with Colemak
[20:48:08] <Miyukii> vim is a text editor with weird controls compared to modern gui editors
[20:48:25] <Miyukii> emacs is an operating system that some people use to edit text files
[20:48:29] <Satin> HeTo: why does myrl use emacs
[20:48:36] <isekaijin> HeTo: Emacs is better at things like keeping definitions in sync between a REPL and the source code file you are editing.
[20:49:46] <JesseDesu> Satin, you should try honey cream burboun
[20:49:56] <HeTo> Satin: why are you asking me and not them?
[20:49:57] <Satin> I think I'll go in vim's direction
[20:50:06] <Satin> I don't want to use another operating system
[20:50:07] <JesseDesu> stop drinking fireball
[20:50:13] <Satin> JesseDesu: k
[20:50:15] <isekaijin> haha
[20:50:30] <Satin> and I do want ergonomics
[20:50:36] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: do you think you have RSI partly because of emacs 
[20:50:36] <Satin> xd
[20:50:47] <Satin> HeTo: thought you'd happen to know
[20:50:51] <Satin> ill ping them in discord
[20:51:04] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: I've had RSI due to PS4 controller mainly
[20:51:12] <Satin> ._.
[20:51:18] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: and some problems due to QWERTY layout
[20:51:28] <isekaijin> Emacs pinky is a thing.
[20:51:34] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: Emacs specific problems have cropped up very rarely
[20:51:39] <Satin> i see
[20:51:50] <Satin> isekaijin: lol
[20:51:51] <Urchin[emacs]> emacs pinky happened to me only once
[20:52:09] <Sapphirus> Usually when I hear people complain about QWERTY, the first thing I wonder is if the know how to type with all five fingers correctly.
[20:52:12] <Satin> i think it's not so much what's happened as much as, what's happening over long periods of time
[20:52:14] <Urchin[emacs]> and that was some extreme amount of key-combos that I was doing at the time, much more than I usually do
[20:52:40] * Satin uses COLEMAK thanks in part to urchin saying something about it when she was learning to touch type 2 years ago
[20:52:40] <JesseDesu> my stomach hurts
[20:52:49] <Satin> aeirnstiearnotienrsioetnaresnteioarntiesr
[20:53:03] <Urchin[emacs]> note that I'm trained on typewriters, which required extreme attention to ergonomics, and learning that included some tricks that are these days forgotten, but some people still require them
[20:53:14] <Satin> heh

[20:53:44] <Urchin[emacs]> I've hit problems with QWERTY during a nanowrimo, so I switched to Colemak
[20:53:48] <HeTo> Satin: bleh, apparently vim adventure doesn't allow you to use all the keys from the beginning, but maybe for a beginner it's a good way to learn the keys

[20:56:52] <Satin> well i meant that text adventure
[20:56:56] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: anyway, read that pdf for starters, ask here or on #emacs if you need something
[20:57:06] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: i've chosen vim though :^)
[20:57:08] <Satin> i'm sorryyyy
[20:57:09] <Urchin[emacs]> I think Emacs has some text adventures itself
[20:57:19] * Satin unless there's crazy people that learn both?
[20:57:41] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: there's some merit to learning both
[20:57:44] <HeTo> Satin: anyway, it's good to learn to properly use the vim movement commands, hjklHL<C-d><C-u><C-f><C-b>{}GweWEbB()0$ and of course the number prefixes
[20:57:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: I actually started with Jed, which emulates Emacs by default
[20:57:55] <Satin> i see, i might come and try emacs once i get some basics with vim
[20:58:00] <isekaijin> Satin: There are better things to spend your time on than learning two very idiosyncratic text editors.
[20:58:01] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: and later I switched to Emacs
[20:58:01] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: i see
[20:58:06] <Satin> isekaijin: for sure lol
[20:58:10] <Satin> isekaijin: i'm using gedit right now
[20:58:16] <Satin> and vscode looks annoying, and i don't like it
[20:59:03] <isekaijin> I haven't tried VS Code seriously, but I don't think my computer needs yet another bloated program made with Electron that makes Emacs look lightweight by comparison.
[20:59:42] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: that's fair, use whatever helps
[20:59:51] <JesseDesu> i did homework on a semi automatic typewriter up to 5th grade

[20:59:59] <Sapphirus> I'm still learning VIM. Although I'm finding I like the VIM-esque binding layout.
[20:59:59] <Urchin[emacs]> I really like Emacs' Calc
[21:00:01] <JesseDesu> which was 1995
[21:00:14] <Urchin[emacs]> it's a neat calculator, uses true decimal system
[21:00:21] <Urchin[emacs]> so 1.1 is a true 1.1
[21:00:27] <HeTo> Satin: and while knowing just d, x, i and a can get you started editing, learning additional editing commands like c, s, r and R is great, and gq is a command that's missing from way too many editors
[21:00:34] <Satin> okay guys guys guys

[21:01:58] <HeTo> Miyukii: there are no scroll bars in neovim
[21:02:04] <Miyukii> anything else will just die/get replaced whatever
[21:02:05] <Miyukii> so?
[21:02:20] <Miyukii> vim has the percentage marker in the bottom
[21:02:33] <HeTo> you can't drag the percentage marker to move around in the file
[21:02:44] <Miyukii> you use keystrokes for that
[21:03:19] <emmeka> I kind of get the thing hipsters with a love of typewriters are going for, it was certainly easier to pound out writing something when you couldn't easily go back and rewrite and the device in front of you didn't also contain 10 billion distractions
[21:03:25] <HeTo> use the right tool for the job. sometimes it's a key mapping for :YcmCompleter GoTo, sometimes it's * or #, sometimes it's a search typed by hand, sometimes it's <C-d> or <C-u>, but sometimes the scrollbar is the correct way
[21:04:02] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: it wasn't love, it was coursework in high school

[21:08:48] <Sapphirus> I've still yet to be able to do more advanced stuff with vim.
[21:09:09] <emmeka> tbh, since I do no real coding and the only times I need to open plain text files it's config files or maybe a shell script, 90% of the time I'll just use xfce mousepad
[21:09:17] <Sapphirus> I can edit stuff, copy/paste, manipulate text at a basic level, but I haven't delved into its more advanced functions.
[21:09:23] <HeTo> I can sort of exit nano as long as the help is on-screen. my trips to nano are always followed by quitting it and repeating the previous command prepending VISUAL=vi
[21:09:40] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: that's certainly ok, I've also used nano
[21:10:15] <Sapphirus> nano is ... once you get even basic vim nailed down
[21:10:21] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: I suppose you're better served with a calculator than a programming language
[21:11:46] <Urchin[emacs]> I can sudo to a config file from within Emacs, usually
[21:11:53] <Urchin[emacs]> using TRAMP
[21:12:24] <Urchin[emacs]> (most people use it for remote editing as well, but I usually have a different instance for anything that needs doing on a remote system)
