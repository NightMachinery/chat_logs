[01:27:03] <z1haze> what do you do when you require 2 words because i literally attempted this exact concept
[01:27:04] <pulse> i think i use snake_case in the odd case that it's two words or more

[08:59:23] <rustyshackleford> ravindUwU: I have one, I'm tinkering with it
[08:59:26] <silly> they're not exactly cheap either
[08:59:36] <ljharb> outside of people that have to use them for work? only an insignificant number of paranoid nutjobs use them

[09:01:00] <ljharb> not if you use a password manager
[09:01:08] <ljharb> 1password, for example, makes them super easy
[09:01:15] <rustyshackleford> I do use a password manager
[09:01:18] <ljharb> and you still need a password when using a yubikey
[09:01:22] <ravindUwU> yeah, Bitwarden here.
[09:01:27] <rustyshackleford> easy is subjective. I'm thinking for someone like my mom
[09:01:30] <ljharb> the point of the yubikey is to ADD it to a password, not to replace a password
[09:01:44] <ljharb> rustyshackleford: well sure but for people that need something easy, they're unavoidably fucked
[09:01:49] <ljharb> security isn't easy
[09:01:56] <rustyshackleford> in most cases yeah, its a second factor to a password
[09:02:03] <ljharb> training them to use a password manager is probably the best you can do

[10:01:00] <ljharb> (from being upset about nothing, i mean)
[10:06:55] <Tabmow> So, I have my HTML documents with no cache-control headers so my clients can pick up new assets when I deploy them. However, some browsers still just cache it anyway? Is this something to worry about? Or will the browser just automagically download new assets somehow?

[10:15:30] <Tabmow> ljharb: what do you mean by a content-address?
[10:16:43] <ljharb> like a hash of the content
[10:16:44] <ljharb> s
[10:16:59] <ljharb> so that if the content is the same, it caches forever, and if it's different, it always loads a new copy (which it caches forever)
[10:18:19] <Tabmow> Ahh right, like the ETag?
[10:19:15] <ljharb> no
[10:19:20] <ljharb> etags are server specific, and should never be used
[10:19:25] <ljharb> also that's a header
[10:19:31] <ljharb> i mean the *URL itself*
[10:19:38] <AlbertLast> webpack builds files like this: app.01085048.js
[10:19:47] <ljharb> never request `/image.jpg,` request `/image-147a6f175461872561895.jpg` or whatever
[10:19:47] *** Joins: shan (shan@cyblog/maintainer/shan)
[10:19:50] <ljharb> yes, like webpack does
[10:20:13] <ljharb> it doesn't matter how your backend handles it, what matters is that the actual URL path the browser looks at depends on the content.
[10:21:59] <Tabmow> Right, I have webpack doing that also. So my assets (css/js etc.) have that hash in the filename when I deploy them new. But the index.html page itself references these assets. So I obviously don't want to cache this file.
[10:23:30] <Tabmow> So for instance, currently I'm not adding any cache headers for my index.html - but I'm caching everything else. So when a client hits my site, if there is any updates to assets they will download the new asset files (with the hash in the name).
[10:23:48] <ljharb> Tabmow: index.html of course shouldn't be cached
[10:23:52] <ljharb> Tabmow: you should have a logicful server
[10:24:01] <ljharb> you can't do anything properly with a static site
[10:24:17] <ljharb> which also means that the HTML request should always be fetched fresh, just in case
[10:24:24] <Tabmow> ljharb: Right, but what I'm saying is in chrome for example, I'm seeing it sometimes serve this file from its cache, regardless of the cache-control headers.
[10:25:03] <ljharb> that doesn't sound right
[10:25:07] <Tabmow> Or is this just maybe what the developer tools are showing vs. what is actually happening
[10:25:55] <Tabmow> I didn't think it sounded right... I'll do some more digging.

[11:40:25] <ThePendulum> I'm not sure if most people actually actively want to set up their application as an SPA anymore, or if it's more that server side rendering is still a bit of a PITA in frameworks that are good for other reasons
[11:40:39] <ThePendulum> more-so than the drawbacks of an SPA

[11:46:04] <deniska> For a user SPA experience is rarely better than SSR experience would be, but often is worse when SPA is implemented poorly
[11:46:46] <ThePendulum> I never started using SPAs for their own sake, it was just the least painful way of using frameworks that helped me sort my components, data binding and styles
[11:46:53] <deniska> if your site can actually be desrcibed as an "application", like photoshop in a browser, or some sort of realtime pokemon cards trading platform, SPA is what you need
[11:47:05] <deniska> if it's a forum or a news site, SPA can only make it worse, not better :)
[11:47:36] <earendel> rendering=producing html code, right? sounds absolutely reasonable to me to fetch the templates, and then populate them client-side by just fetching the data. .. downside on SPAs: client side routing is not good? like changing the url forces a reload of the page?
[11:48:23] <silly> earendel, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History
[11:48:30] <deniska> downside of SPAs is a death by a thousand papercuts, what just worked may break, like back button, URLs, history, page load progress indicator etc
[11:48:42] <silly> you can change the url without navigating away
[11:48:43] <ThePendulum> scroll position is my main gripe with it
[11:49:07] <earendel> maybe also.. hard to manage huge loads of data .. especially between windows?
[11:49:26] <deniska> Like a web developer has to put effort to make things work again which would otherwise just work for free
[11:50:20] <earendel> deniska: agree on the routing issues. (like with history)
[11:50:51] <earendel> i didn't want to say restless state.
[11:50:54] <ThePendulum> but every time I look into utilizing SSR, the list of benefits is just way too short for the development overhead
[11:51:23] <deniska> also being in JS room I guess we may mean a bit different thing by SSR :)
[11:51:31] <ThePendulum> it's half past 10 in the morning and I haven't slept, I'm definitely in a restless state
[11:51:53] <deniska> In js world lately ssr means adapting a client-side framework to produce html which sounds like a bit of a complex task actually
[11:51:59] <earendel> you mean producing html code, right? ThePendulum
[11:52:25] <deniska> I mean producing html, but without a client-side framework, using, well, templates
[11:52:43] <ThePendulum> I'm mainly talking about using frameworks like vue or react without defaulting to an SPA
[11:53:12] <deniska> ah yeah, that sounds like all the complexity of developing an SPA, with an added complexity of bolting SSR on
[11:53:28] <earendel> defaulting is good.
[11:53:37] <deniska> colloquially known as "going full circle" :)
[11:54:17] <earendel> what
[11:54:20] <ThePendulum> yeah, SSR is a bit of an afterthought and continues to take additional effort, it's gotten a bit better
[11:54:29] <earendel> you don't mean roundtrips or sth
[11:54:49] <earendel> because they are independent of where you render html.
[11:54:56] <deniska> using vue for ssr is a very round-about way of achieving what we had in 90s with perl and php :)

[11:59:51] <ThePendulum> the frameworks I used with php didn't really offer any facilities for data binding or style management in the front end
[12:01:08] <deniska> You have <a> to make GET requests and <form> to make other kinds of requests, ought to be enough for everybody :)
[12:01:23] <earendel> funnyways you can use anchors for scrolling position as well as other state information (location.hash)
[12:04:12] <ThePendulum> the position would have to align with a specific component and you'd have to manually write it into the history, and then it also doesn't apply to subdivs
[12:04:43] <earendel> the main issue with all approaches semms an app has no central background process that would distribute information to open tabs. and serviceworkers address that point in a poor way
[12:05:18] <earendel> ThePendulum: location.hash is stored in history
[12:06:16] <earendel> so if you click anchor #nlah then #foo you can go back to #blah with the back button on a 100% static html page.
[12:06:18] <ThePendulum> there won't be a hash for where you're scrolled to unless you manually add it though
[12:07:10] <earendel> (also without reloading it .. which makes the hash employable for client side routing .. )
[12:08:35] <earendel> ThePendulum: erm yes. but you remember anchors right? and/or understand the parallels here.
[12:09:06] <ThePendulum> sure
[12:09:12] <earendel> cool.

[12:31:49] <earendel> just have to convince css ppl to add a -unit css property, for all properties using units (px,vh,% etc), so that you can easily compute things, without parsing/rendering some string back and forth.

[17:30:29] <median> meh.
[17:31:15] <median> so I'm writing a progrma as part of the eloquent js book, which seeks to discover if two values are equal objects (with the same properties) where the values of those properties are equal, when compared with a recursive call
[17:31:18] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)

[17:31:50] <median> but at the same time i feel like i may be beating myself up a bit much about it
[17:32:22] <median> now, I know I can Object.keys() and Object.values() but I can't bring myself to figure out how I want to really compare them
[17:32:58] <median> so i'm not sure if I want to perform a recursion on Object.keys(a).forEach(function(key) { ... }
[17:33:03] <median> or even how I'm going about it
[17:33:12] <stenno> Object.entries is the correct approach

[17:38:11] <stenno> so its not suitable for comparison
[17:38:17] <median> been stumped for a few days
[17:38:25] <median> wanna see the entire program?
[17:38:34] <stenno> well yeah, just use recursive Object.entries
[17:38:55] <stenno> should be trivial
[17:40:02] <stenno> however you cannot compare equiality if the value is a funciton
[17:40:11] <stenno> unless you have the actual function reference
[17:40:23] <median> https://pastebin.com/emsa5jHy
[17:40:38] <median> nah, instructions don't really factor functions into the problem, but sure - i'd like a complete solution
[17:40:47] <median> sorry, which pastebin sites do you gusys like here?
[17:41:01] <stenno> its fine
[17:41:14] <stenno> but don't use JSON.stringify for comparison
[17:41:25] <stenno> just do it with recurse Object.entries call

[20:45:01] <zsoc> lantech19446: your question is super obtuse, as it makes a lot of assumptions... but using my crystal ball, i will guess that it is seeing the json file as it is, a file made up of text. To "see" it as "the individual items within the file" it has to be parsed as JSON, in whatever language the web scraper is written in.
[20:45:42] <zsoc> Like in javascript: const data = JSON.parse('{ "foo": 1 }');
[20:46:41] <lantech19446> zsoc: I apologize for not being more clear, I honestly don't understand this stuff super well and i'm not sure exactly what my question needed to be I guess that answers my question though. Parsehub has the ability to import JSON I'll try that instead of trying to load it as a site
[20:48:23] <zsoc> Basically just remember that JSON is text, or a string (depending on context) that *represents* some set of data that may include objects, lists, properties, etc. But until something parses the JSON, it's just a string.

[20:53:07] <lantech19446> this is going to take a long time to parse lol it's web log
[20:54:28] <zsoc> It... might? I mean it depends on what you're trying to do, and how big it is. If you have a JSON file, you may want to just... parse it in javascript (or some other scripting language) and pull what you need out of it. It would likely be infinitely quicker than some visual tool (or whatever parsehub is)
[20:55:49] <zsoc> but "big" is relative, nothing should really take "a long time" unless it's wildly inefficient or .. i don't know... gb of data? Even then, as long as you have the RAM it should be fine :p otherwise you'd be looking to digest it into a database of some sort to query from
[20:55:56] <lantech19446> parsehub is a web scraper the software I use will spit it out in html format too and right now I have a cron job processing the statistics daily and then I just go through the page and get what I need but I was hoping to automate the rest of it

[21:00:33] <zsoc> Ah, you want to read logs and append to a spreadsheet, gotcha. Yeah it's doable in any scripting language, but varying degrees of a pain in the neck depending on what kind of spreadsheet (like a google sheet? etc).
[21:01:04] <lantech19446> just a local excel spreadsheet
[21:01:10] <zsoc> But a small script to transform the data to output the way you need, so that you can then copy/paste it somewhere... that would be pretty trivial.
[21:02:21] <lantech19446> maybe once I learn js that'll be one of my projects the only languages i know right now are html and css and i've only been using them a couple months so I haven't progressed onto js yet
[21:05:10] <zsoc> There may be other online json parsers that have some features like filtering / aggregation. I'm sure there are anyway, probably local stuff too. I've just never had to try to find one before hehe.

[21:06:55] <lantech19446> yea this is all new to me too not a lot of freeware out there for it since big data is a big thing right now. I just want to automate the whole thing I don't mind having to start the process manually but it should result in a finished product for me. If I can find that I'd be happy

[21:10:02] <zsoc> There's a lot of "If this than that" sort of stuff out there... like zapier/integeromat, etc, but i ultimately nothing is free with these services. Good luck finding something - but taking a dive into JS might be worth it sometime xD
[21:10:28] <lantech19446> I plan on it i'm trying to become a front end dev so I need to eventually
[21:11:08] <lantech19446> I found a json parser with a search function the really interesting part is it completely ignores the URI's which are contained in data and I don' tknow why
[21:11:45] <zsoc> can you show me an example of your real data? it may be malformed in some way
[21:12:34] <lantech19446> I actually just figured it out I had to switch to 4 tab this is still going to be a tedious process but here's the report https://lansdalelibrary.org/html/report.json
[21:13:45] <lantech19446> shit this is showing me stuff that I don't get in the html version
[21:15:45] <zsoc> What is it you need out of this?
[21:15:58] <lantech19446> so apparently there's even more results in the json than gets into the html report I guess because of space constraints
[21:16:14] <lantech19446> I need the hits and visitors for anything involving coalition

[21:19:26] <zsoc> by "anything involving coalition", do you mean the /coalition endpoint, including sub paths like coalition/fair, etc? And by "anything" do you mean, aggregating them all together into 1 total amount, or to keep the separate amounts for each path?
[21:21:59] <deadmund> I have a simple timer application written using javascript and html and css.  I distribute it to a client for use on offline windows computers to run in chrome (the browser).  I send them a zip file and some instructions about which HTML file to open.  Why isn't there any tool or packaging system that I can use to distribute them a more slick and professional package?  Thanks in advance.
[21:23:48] <zsoc> You can package it as a "desktop application" by bundling it with V8/node via electron. That's generally how web apps are "distributed" these days. Otherwise your answer is "because you're sending them a file to run in their browser" lol

[21:27:30] <zsoc> Alternatively... if you just want it to be "simpler" but not necessarily an application, you could use something like posthtml to "bundle" the html+css+images all into 1 html file (embedding the images/css inline) - and then they wouldn't really need instructions because they are just opening 1 file? which in theory would be in a browser? lol

[21:36:34] <zsoc> You could fork this... in theory... and maybe alter it slightly to your needs if you're willing to look at some manuals :p but i think JS help is probably the only help i can offer at this point... given the channel you're in lol
[21:38:09] <lantech19446> actually that's really awesome, is that working off the url?
[21:38:45] <zsoc> Yes, it's 10 lines of code, which is in the window off the left, written in javascript and running via the node.js framework (uh, but also in a browser, using the repl.it service in this case lol - but you could run it locally to your machine too)
[21:38:45] <lantech19446> nm just answered my own question
[21:39:09] <zsoc> and tbf, there's 2 lines of code that do anything logical, the rest is just "load these libraries" and "get the file" lol
[21:39:45] <lantech19446> so i'm assuming if i ran this locally it would be in a command prompt
[21:39:51] <zsoc> correct
[21:40:15] <lantech19446> and i'd still save it as title.js it doesn't need anything special because it's node?
[21:41:34] <zsoc> you would need to install node.js, you would need to click the "download as zip" there with the 3 dots, because there's 3 files (the package.json, the package lock, and the index.js file), and then unzip it into a dir. Type `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then any time you wanted to run it, `node index.js` while in that directory, yes.
[21:41:53] <zsoc> In theory you could run it instead in your browser console but... there's probably CORS issues there.
[21:42:18] <zsoc> yep, doesn't allow CORS lol - so yeah this would be the only way

[21:43:17] <lantech19446> I mean if you don't mind keeping it i'll run it that way I just figured you wouldn't want it taking up space in your files
[21:43:41] <zsoc> And as far as the output, it's just spitting out the filtered objects from the request list... an extra line or 2 would format them however you need to copy/paste in your spreadsheet. More than that would involve including an additional library to read/append to the spreadsheet, which might be a little over the top at the moment

[23:23:40] <FlorianBad> I have the impression that getElementsByClassName returns not just the matching elements but also an additional value that is the number of elements matched. Is it possible? Or is it because of my implementation? I do `for( const ele_idx in ele_list ){`  after on what it returned
[23:23:48] <zsoc> having "multiple brackets after a function name" is not any sort of magic, you're just calling a function which returns a function... so you're calling that one, also. foo(1)(2) is like let a = foo(1); a(2)

[23:29:10] <FlorianBad> hmm yeah it's definitely my implementation, looks like that for/in is in a mistake
[23:29:19] <silly_> oh, maybe i understnd now...
[23:29:31] <zsoc> for..in is always a mistake
[23:30:47] <silly_> i've seen "peek definition" boxes in vscode, but dunno if there is something like what you want

[23:34:22] <zsoc> FlorianBad: tldr; use for..of or an iterator method (and you might have to Array.from() it first, cos it's an element collection or whatever)

[23:40:46] <robyndrake> I thought interface was part of the ECMAscript specification, is it not?
[23:42:16] <ljharb> robyndrake: never has been, likely never will be
[23:42:26] <ljharb> in JS, an interface is just a conceptual thing.
[23:42:34] <robyndrake> oh ok, thanks
