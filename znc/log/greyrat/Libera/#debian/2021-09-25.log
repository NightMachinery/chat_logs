[00:02:45] <greycat> Again, you may be operating under false assumptions, such as "if I continue complaining in #debian, something good will happen".
[00:02:46] <Khepra> but ultimately, proper security assumes software may be vulnerable and establishes policies based on that initial premise.

[00:35:21] <joepublic> however, given canonical's past attitude, it wouldn't surprise much of anyone.

[00:35:48] <PMT> I think it would probably surprise a number of people, because Canonical doesn't have a burning desire to lose customers, and that's what would happen if that came out.

[02:19:07] <Animortis> I thought it had to do with luks2 support, so I installed with luks1, and it didn't change anything.

[02:19:22] <Khepra> oh so you have encrypted /boot as well?
[02:19:38] <Animortis> I did not, actually. /boot is on a vfat partition.
[02:19:52] <Khepra> oh so you have EFI in the picture too?
[02:20:13] <Animortis> My only theory is it should be encrypted, too, and then /boot/efi is in vfat, so it's /boot/efi/EFI.
[02:20:16] <Animortis> Yes.
[02:20:43] <Khepra> well. I'm not sure how well entire /boot on vfat works, sharing the ESP. I would not recommend that, however, due to various systems possibly failing as they expect a posix filesystem under /boot
[02:21:10] <Khepra> one recommended pattern is /boot with /boot/efi mount for the ESP. by default grub-efi even expects that path
[02:21:19] <Animortis> Khepra: Do you know if you can load grub if /boot is encrypted?
[02:21:24] <Khepra> I'm certainly using that and it works quite well
[02:21:42] <Animortis> I use that on my non-encrypted system, but I didn't expect grub to care about a posix filesystem for loading grub stuff.
[02:21:58] <Animortis> I figured if grub was unencrypted, it'd load.
[02:22:07] <Khepra> Animortis: yes, requires enabling crypto modules in /etc/default/grub; but also has quirks in, as you mention, luks1 support only and some other things that escape me now, it's been a while since I attempted encrypted /boot
[02:22:27] <Animortis> I've probably done this 10 times today. I can try again.
[02:22:39] <Animortis> Fortunately, at home I can drink while I work.
[02:22:47] <Khepra> personally I see no purpose in encrypted /boot, it's not in my threat model. If I wanted secure boot (signed chain of command from the power button to login prompt) ... I'd just use secureboot.
[02:24:17] <Animortis> Well, my concern is I'd need a third partition for /boot alone.
[02:24:27] <Khepra> btw, encrypted /boot which is also ESP? or did I misunderstand you?
[02:24:37] <Animortis> I'm not sure what ESP means.
[02:24:44] <Khepra> EFI System Partition, the vfat thingy

[02:25:00] <Animortis> So it's currently /boot for ESP.
[02:25:05] <Animortis> Typically, I go /boot/efi for that.
[02:25:13] <Khepra> so that can't be encrypted
[02:25:28] <Animortis> But I was trying to keep all the grub files unencrypted. So /boot is vfat.

[03:47:17] <tjcarter> Not joke.
[03:48:39] <tjcarter> I really do seriously, absolutely, and definitely want to make my own unofficial Debian live image with dark mode enabled.
[03:48:54] <tjcarter> and the ability to run the old debian installer from the live desktop
[03:48:56] <tjcarter> :P
[03:49:28] <tjcarter> 😛
[03:49:29] <greycat> what in tf is "dark mode"

[03:51:15] * greycat googles ... oh, it has something to do with GNOME.
[03:51:24] <greycat> that would be why I have absolutely no idea what it means
[03:51:26] <tjcarter> Adwaita does
[03:51:38] <n4dir> though i gotta say when hearing dark mode i had other things in mind too.
[03:51:51] <n4dir> 7-proxies or such
[03:51:54] <tjcarter> greycat: dark mode, as in STOP BLINDING ME WITH BRIGHT WHITE SCREENS
[03:52:13] <greycat> at first I thought you were talking about the installer, but then I read it again and you're talking about Live CDs, and apparently specifically the GNOME one
[03:52:30] <grys> how does 😛 show on debian? to me it shows as a black and white emoji.. on a non-linux pc/tablet it looks bigger and colorful. is this feature available on a linux?

[03:56:06] <tjcarter> Every single Android app for the past seven years has offered "dark mode" themes, it's now standard in newer versions of Android to offer it system wide. Windows 10 offers "dark mode" UI (though it's Windows, so it's inconsistent and broken.) iOS has a "dark mode" as of iOS 13. macOS got "dark mode" in 10.14. Gnome had it in 3.08 or so I think. Cinnamon's had it for years. XFCE had it in 2012. LXDE
[03:56:08] <tjcarter> had it … *sigh*
[03:56:29] <somiaj> so make your own live image, live-build
[03:56:49] <tjcarter> it's only been the reason I've been grumbling about persistence not working in Linux install and live images for YEARS
[03:57:38] * n4dir tries to figure out which toolkit is used by fvwm
[03:57:43] <tjcarter> somiaj: the name of a package which comes with a BOOK to explain how to use it doesn't really help. If it were that easy as install a package, I'd have done that years ago.
[03:58:17] <tjcarter> It manages to be a serious irritant for a few days about once every two or three years
[03:58:34] <n4dir> tjcarter: live-build could just make a live-bootable snapshot of an installation, but can't anymore. refractasnapshot, not a debian package, still does it
[03:58:47] <n4dir> install, configure, run refractasnapshot. done

[04:00:06] <n4dir> somiaj: uhum. So it was kind of a hint why not everyone thinks of dark mode, Adwaita, at first glance
[04:00:10] <somiaj> part of what makes some of the stuff in fvwm a bit unflexiable, is because it isn't using a toolkit, it has to solve all the problems toolkits already have
[04:00:21] <tjcarter> n4dir: it's also been made so you can't just install the installer on a working system so you can … use it to make installations.
[04:00:41] <greycat> tjcarter: oh, so your request is actually HUGE, not just one Live CD image, but *all* of them?  You want to change every single one of them?  Good luck.
[04:00:47] <n4dir> tjcarter: what?
[04:00:59] <greycat> (and "Adwaita:dark" was apparently just "one example" that was supposed to be informative...)
[04:01:06] <tjcarter> greycat: my request is to add a theme and the ability to select it.

[04:04:43] <greycat> Wow, that was fast.
[04:04:46] <tjcarter> It gets a little more complex because you have to set both GTK+ and Qt themes on the GTK+ desktops to use a Qt-based installer, but whenever I actually have time to read and understand the BOOK that accompanies debian-live, the patches are probably very minor.
[04:04:58] <tjcarter> greycat: you'
[04:05:28] <tjcarter> greycat: you're an asshole. And I'm legally blind and light-sensitive. I've had a problem using Debian's installer because it is physically painful
[04:05:35] <n4dir> in the meantime before reading that book, you might just create your hardly desired live as described
[04:05:47] <tjcarter> greycat: at this point, you're bordering on discrimination from where I sit
[04:06:03] * n4dir assumes a plonk soon to be heard.
[04:06:06] <greycat> Well, tell them that over in #debian-live.
[04:07:02] <somiaj> Then by all means, make a patch and submit it, I'm sure the team would be interested, but the live team has always been fairly small and revolving, so they may not have the time.
[04:07:30] <tjcarter> somiaj: that's why I generally have plans to make a patch for it
[04:09:28] <tjcarter> somiaj: I've gotta have time to learn how the live-build system actually works (something I do want to learn, but it takes a certain amount of uninterrupted time to do it), then I need to actually build a patch for one, test, and then generalize and test. When I have time for it, I'll offer a patch along with a request.

[15:45:49] <dpkg> In 2021 and beyond, you should not worry about wearing out your SSD unless you have a prehistoric SSD. If your use case is writing out hundreds of TB within several years (typical SSD endurance these days), then you likely have the means to use redundant arrays, hot standbys and have ensured data endurance. Therefore, writing out 10TB or 50TB more or less should be irrelevant for you.

[16:42:59] <Khepra> Zr40: hrm, I was hoping to see logged a problem with nvidia....    so now I'm out of ideas, but quick googling suggests a possible solution in forcing the gpu modules be loaded early in initramfs.
[16:43:54] <Zr40> that sounds unlikely...
[16:44:16] <Khepra> check all the nvidia* modules that are involved on your system (iirc there's nvidia, nividia-modeset and one more),  and add them, one per line of /etc/initramfs-tools/modules ;   then update-initramfs -u   (just for the current kernel). note: this might bork your boot, so make sure you have rescue media available, though if you update only the current kernel initramfs, you should have a fallback
[16:45:58] <Khepra> Zr40: well these guys state this fixed it, though that's not debian or initramfs-tools, it's the concept of loading early. makes sense, if there's a delay in module loading or gpu init by the time gdm decides which session to start...    https://superuser.com/a/1422220

[18:50:17] <beuys> joepublic: I might be wrong. But I thought a snap is something like a docker container.

[18:55:57] <beuys> somiaj: Let me check. I clicked on a bunch of them and some sounded like RCE via HTML to me. Maybe I am wrong. Since there are over 100 it is a bit hard to recheck ...

[18:59:07] <beuys> Blondie101010: As a web developer, I cannot not use Chromium.
[18:59:28] <somiaj> beuys: that is not how the tracker works. Again yet another one that says 'Google Chrome' which is not the same as chormium
[18:59:49] <beuys> I have Firefox and Chromium open all the time. To get a feel for how pages behave in the browsers that users use.
[19:00:06] <beuys> somiaj: So how does the tracker work?
[19:00:56] <somiaj> when a CVE is issued it often just provides a chromium version wither or not all version are affected, vs just google chrome, or andriods versions
[19:01:26] <somiaj> debian's chromium is compiled with different flags, doesn't contain the same code as google chrome or andriod's version, so just because there is a CVE doesn't mean it actually affects debian, but the tracker just auto tags this
[19:01:28] <Blondie101010> beuys:  so you're concerned about security vulnerabilities that would be triggered by the code *you* wrote???  do you see where the logic stops?
[19:01:48] <Blondie101010> just don't go on every random site
[19:02:29] <beuys> Blondie101010: 1: I not only need to get a feel for the pages I work on.
[19:02:30] <somiaj> I'm not saying these defintally don't affect debian, chromium is a complicated beast that is built in so many different ways, I just trust the debian security team to stay on top of this as best as they can and deal with the major issues that actually affect the debian package.
[19:02:53] <beuys> Blondie101010: 2: The pages I work on do not only contain my code. In this day and age, pages are assembled from gazillions of hosts.

[19:28:27] <beuys> This statement seems to go verbatim on the debian page.

[19:38:49] <Pajus> you just good for botnets
[19:40:57] <somiaj> also out of this conversation, is why do browsers have so many security issues, because they keep adding new buggy features, that require new libaries, compiles, and depends to build. Maybe instead of insting debian package the 'latest version', go to google and ask they release a ltr of chromium in which they can focus on only secuirty/bug issues and stop adding features
[19:41:41] <somiaj> personally I switched to firefox because of esr, chromium would regurally have regressions when running it in sid
[19:44:10] <sussudio> just use netcat.

[19:45:40] <beuys> Thinking about moving applications between machines: docker *images* could be the way.
[19:46:42] <beuys> So if the application does not need to persist data (Chromium / Firefox / Thunderbird don't need to), after configuring them one could create an image via docker commit. And from then on use that image.
