[00:06:40] <companion_cube> it's like, yes, the american left sucks, and so does the french left fwiw
[00:06:53] <companion_cube> but it's not a reason to equate it to fascists
[00:08:03] <gerikson> no, but they are supporting naked aggression in the interests of an ethno-state
[00:08:29] <gerikson> they're buying into the myth that Ukraine has no right to be a nation
[00:12:05] <companion_cube> and that it's NATO's fault
[00:13:12] <ngoldbaum> unfortunately it’s pretty clear there’s a lot of people straight up lying about all kinds of things and other people who report what they say credulously in the interest of showing all sides of an issue
[00:13:38] <ngoldbaum> so you get all kinds of alternate fact-universes where anyone can believe anything and find support
[00:14:10] <ngoldbaum> especially if believing a lie serves someone powerful’s interests or desires

[18:44:17] <gwozniak> Finally reading this Dan Luu post, "Why is it so hard to buy things that work well?" and damn this writing could be a lot more focussed
[18:46:05] <gwozniak> I don't mind long essays, but long essays with streches of ponderous prose is tedious
[18:52:38] <gwozniak> I predicted the answer would be "it doesn't make money" and, well, that's basically the answer I get from the essay

[19:42:40] <bontaq> probably a dumb question, but say if react had a GPL license -- would you be required to release all your code using react?  or just your modified version of react, if you did that

[19:54:15] <epilys> you mean because it's client side?
[19:54:38] <epilys> in this case it's distribution of your code (not necessarily *source* code) so that falls under GPL

[20:17:17] <bontaq> hmm I think I understand better, so if phoenix live view / phoenix was GPL'd, you probably don't need to distribute all your code built on it, but you would if it was AGPL?
[20:20:18] <ngoldbaum> bontaq: your code can be licensed however you like, however if your code links with gpl code, the “full” distribution of all the code must be licensed under the gpl
[20:21:01] <ngoldbaum> in practice this is confusing and most people aren’t really clear if the linking clause applies in various corner cases, and a lot of the time people ignore the linking clause
[20:21:49] <ngoldbaum> the agpl only matters for serverside stuff, where the client never gets a copy of the source code
[20:21:59] <ngoldbaum> or runs a compiled version
[20:22:52] <ngoldbaum> if you license your server-side webapp as agpl, then you must have a mechanism for someone to get the source code of the webapp from you if they use your webapp over the network
[20:23:28] <ngoldbaum> or if your server-side webapp uses an agpl library (again, the linking clause of the gpl)
