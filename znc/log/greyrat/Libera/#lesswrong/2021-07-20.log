[00:00:53] <ggreer> apparently solar cells have been decreasing in price by 15% every year... since 1977
[00:01:22] <gwern> (which gives you an idea how collossally expensive they were back during carter!)
[00:01:22] <ggreer> if this continues for another decade, I'm not sure what the implications will be. at that point solar cells will be cheaper than drywall
[00:01:40] <ggreer> (for the same unit area, not mass)
[00:01:53] <ggreer> yeah they were over 250x more expensive back then
[00:02:43] <kuudes> Logos01, ssab is moving toward making its steelcasting plants to not output carbon by switching the process to hydrogen
[00:04:47] <kuudes> https://www.ssab.com/fossil-free-steel/ssab-aims-to-hit-the-market-with-the-worlds-first-fossil-free-steel-in-2026

[00:05:09] <kuudes> that would be useful as iirc ssab raahe plant makes some 8% of finland's co2 emissions or so
[00:06:05] <kuudes> there is nuke plant planned next to their steel plant to pyhäjoki. but the project went to rosatom because the french and the japanese folded, so I wonder if anything comes out of that

[00:12:28] <Logos01> kuudes: "In the next phase, coal and coke have traditionally been used in the blast furnace process to remove oxygen from the iron ore to create iron. In the HYBRIT process, SSAB aims to replace the coal and coke with hydrogen gas as a sustainable alternative."
[00:12:30] <shawwwn> onward to the next technical interview
[00:12:38] <Logos01> They're not using hydrogen for fuel there.
[00:13:11] <Logos01> They're using it as a combustion reactant to purify the sponge iron after electrolysing water to get hydrogen gas for that purpose.  
[00:14:04] <Logos01> Which, sure, that works to remove the need for coke for that, but then you're stuck using coke again anyhow in the next phase where you convert the iron into proper steel.
[00:14:16] <Logos01> (As opposed to doing both in the same phase.)
[00:15:38] <Logos01> Though admittedly you can probably use far less because you at that point are only worried about getting the elemental carbon suffused through the iron.
[00:16:03] <Logos01> That's gonna *seriously* raise the cost of producing that steel though, since you're now on the hook for using electricity as the heatsource.

As in: there were no published schedules of movie times. You went to the theater, paid an entrance fee, and just sat down and watched whatever was showing, for as long as you wanted. So filmmakers were making films catering to that...
[00:40:04] <gwern> ...viewing environment: people walking in the door and watching whatever was playing. But in the mid-sixties, movie theaters started publishing specific showing times for specific films, and people started showing up for specific films. According to Cavell, this apparently tiny social shift essentially changes the relationship between filmmaker and audience. Because an audience member can now...
[00:40:10] <gwern> ...think of themselves as being interested in a particular kind of movie — action, horror, Westerns, art-house.

[01:49:57] <galambo> as a generalist who can find connections between random things, I think there is a strong similarity between two apparently different concepts. the first concept is 'trade tariffs are usually harmful'. the second concept is 'giving saline (salty water via drip) to people who have low sodium in their blood can sometimes be counterproductive and worsen their condition
[01:50:12] <galambo> '
[01:50:46] * gwern squints. go on.
[01:52:47] <galambo> in the low sodium scenario. giving saline can help them if their hyponatremia (low sodium) is caused by dehydration. but in some cases the fault is the programming of the body. a hormone that makes the body retain water is produced inappropriately. so the body excretes sodium in the urine but keeps the water. so the blood becomes even more diluted.
[01:53:07] <galambo> did you get it?
[01:53:07] <vorpalhex_> Hey, is there anyone who uses or is familiar with ClinicalTrials.gov? Like 90% of the studies I find never have results posted - is this normal? What's the usual lag time on results?
[01:53:32] <gwern> medical trials take forever, but yes, preregistration is not enforced
[01:53:55] <gwern> you can find analyses of CT.gov about followup and estimates of how many (few) will ever publish
[01:53:58] <galambo> in the faulty programming scenario. if you give salted water, the salt goes away in the urine, but the body keeps the water. so the blood becomes more diluted
[01:54:41] <galambo> its the ratio that matters not the absolute amount
[01:54:45] <galambo> and the same with trade
[01:55:19] <vorpalhex_> hmm, thank you
[01:56:09] <galambo> I wont explain the trade part because you probably already know it
[01:57:16] <ggreer> why the hell do they call it hypo/hyper-whatever instead of "low salt" "high salt"? low and high sound very different. "hypo" and "hyper" sound... surprisingly similar
[01:57:30] <ggreer> especially if you're british
[01:57:40] <gwern> 'hypomania', my bete-noire
[01:57:48] <galambo> the way to fix the body in that situation is to a)restrict how much water they drink b) give them salt tablets c) give them a hormone that counteracts the faulty programming
[01:58:00] <galambo> the human body can sometimes make sense

[02:02:53] <gwern> the trade part
[02:04:12] <galambo> ah. ok lets say we work in a reception in a hospital. you are very experienced. you triage a patient in 5 minutes and then spend 15 minutes doing their paperwork. I am new to the job. it takes me one hour to triage a patient and half an hour to do the paperwork.
[02:04:26] <galambo> so you take 15 minutes and I take 1.5 hours to see a patient

[02:10:13] <kuudes> what is counterproductive?
[02:10:53] <galambo> kuudes, in the low salt scenario, a lay person would think that giving them salted water would fix them.
[02:11:28] <galambo> in the trade tariffs scenario, a layperson would think that trade tariffs help protect their economy
[02:11:54] <kuudes> I agree with gwern in that I don't follow

[02:21:53] <galambo> ggreer, doctors are not just managers. medicine is harder than you think. there is a huge inferential gap between what the doctor is thinking of and trying to fix and what the patient thinks is happening. doctors try to explain the situation but it is not always simple. so its not just being a manager. there is lots of nuance.
[02:23:01] <ggreer> eh. I know a lot of doctors. they have broad knowledge, but any reasonably smart person with google can usually find out more about a specific issue
[02:24:04] <galambo> for example with pneumonia. there are lots of different bugs that can cause pneumonia. and each of them can cause a different clinical picture and xray findings. and it is quite confusing. and you are working with limited evidence.
[02:24:14] <galambo> and for each bug there is an optimal regimen of antibiotics
[02:24:32] <ggreer> right. that's knowledge that anyone can read. it's just that only doctors are allowed to treat
[02:24:39] <Gurkenglas> ggreer, like with it support?
[02:24:43] *** Quits: Matthias1 (~Matthias1@cpe-76-170-236-166.socal.res.rr.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:25:09] <ggreer> Gurkenglas: yeah basically
[02:26:05] <galambo> ggreer, I lean libertarian and I am against regulation. but I think you are not giving doctors and nurses enough credit. the job is tough and stressful. and it is a lot more nuanced than you think
[02:26:37] <galambo> for example lets say someone has had a course of antibiotics but their condition is not improving
[02:26:38] <galambo> what now
[02:26:51] <galambo> they already had some aggressive antibiotics
[02:26:55] <galambo> their cultures grew nothing
[02:27:08] <galambo> the xray looks worse
[02:27:23] <Logos01> galambo: It's a problem of investment at that point.
[02:27:41] <galambo> Logos01, ok you are the doctor. what do you do now?
[02:27:42] <Logos01> Your GPs will just refer you to a specialist in cases like that, 9 times out of 10.
[02:27:46] <ggreer> I just said that doctors have broad knowledge but can be beaten in specific cases by a smart person with google.... and you give me a situation that is extremely general (requiring broad knowledge to solve)
[02:28:18] <galambo> ggreer, doctors also can google/uptodate
[02:28:28] <ggreer> yeah but a lot of the time they don't
[02:28:31] <Logos01> galambo: Most misdiagnosis comes from the fact that they are too schedule-harassed to bother.
[02:28:46] <Logos01> They see something that looks like the usual thing, and they treat it as the usual thing.
[02:29:03] <ggreer> I'm not even going to google to answer this question. if antibiotics didn't work and cultures grew nothing then it's probably viral
[02:29:04] <Logos01> This can be a pretty severe problem in cases where "looks like the usual thing" is compounded by biases of the doctor.
[02:29:25] <Logos01> It's a common belief that women are prone to hypocondria about reproductive concerns for example.
[02:29:46] <Logos01> So you see a lot of valid health issues waved off as "neurosis" or "anxiety".
[02:30:19] <galambo> ggreer, wrong. thats unlikely in such a scenario. anyways Im starting to feel you guys are borderline trolling me
[02:30:37] <Logos01> galambo: https://www.health.com/condition/reproductive-health/blogger-13-pound-ovarian-tumor <-- stories like this happen all the time.
[02:30:37] <Robomot> Doctors Told Woman With 13-Pound Ovarian Tumor She Was Just 'Gassy or Boated' | Health.com (Blogger Chanté Burkett revealed in a recent Instagram post that doctors ignored her symptoms for months, but she eventually discovered a 13-pound cystic tumor growing on her right ovary.)
[02:30:46] <Betawolf> There's definitely a knowledge gap between people and their doctors, but there's also an effort gap the other way -- doctors often have limited time to spend considering a single case, and learn to be very dubious of certain patient-reported symptoms. 
[02:31:05] <galambo> Logos01, yes lets ignore our bayesian priors and do CT scans on everyone
[02:31:31] <galambo> you feel bloated? you like cats. you're gonna get a cat
[02:31:35] <galambo> thats what you need
[02:31:56] <kuudes> mris look nice
[02:32:03] <Betawolf> The irritating thing is when doctors try to discourage patients from learning anything about their condition and the known treatments for it, seemingly out of a fear that they'll fall prey to quackery. 
[02:32:04] <galambo> oh you think you might have a tumour from your cat? lets do another cat
[02:32:09] <kuudes> pet and cat carry radiation load, isn't it?
[02:32:17] <galambo> yes
[02:32:19] <kuudes> indeed

[02:33:06] <kuudes> well, once a year thingies could be useful, though expensive
[02:33:22] <Betawolf> My wife had a condition that wouldn't have been caught if she hadn't read the NICE guidelines herself and suggested things to her doctor.
[02:33:50] <kuudes> my sister had a cancer that got caught because she secondguessed iirc
[02:33:58] <Logos01> galambo: https://europepmc.org/article/med/9004374 <-- when your bayesian priors are known to be miscalibrated, they should be updated.

[02:34:15] <kuudes> but yes, being a doctor is hard, I agree
[02:34:20] <kuudes> and often sucks
[02:34:20] <Logos01> "30-50% of women diagnosed with depression were misdiagnosed."
[02:34:43] <Logos01> That's a serious problem, and a meaningful part of why it happens is faulty priors.

[02:37:44] <shawwwn> look at this person, being able to do it on the second try
[02:38:03] <galambo> doctors and nurses are working with limited resources. they are being squeezed as much as could be possible by their employers. doctors and nurses have an obligation toward their patients and their employers are aware of it.
[02:38:06] <Logos01> galambo: There have been documented cases of women with rectal bleeding and a family history of colon cancer being told they were just gassy due to anxiety and being sent home with valium.

[02:38:51] <galambo> we routinely miss our lunch breaks
[02:39:04] <kuudes> I would be for more workhour regulation for doctors but iirc so far doctors unions have often opposed those
[02:39:06] <Betawolf> yeah, that's a symptom of systematic problems
[02:39:27] <galambo> I just had a chat today with someone who was clearly burned out
[02:40:35] <galambo> and especially with covid. I was covering covid wards with a surgical mask and a plastic sheet
[02:40:41] <Betawolf> if anyone remembers my pastes about that guy who scraped his dick to shreds on a lamppost etc., they were from https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35510008-this-is-going-to-hurt which also made a strong case for how messed up the NHS is in how it treats its medical staff.
[02:40:42] <Robomot> This is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor by Adam Kay (This is Going to Hurt book. Read 12,850 reviews from the world's largest community for readers. The Sunday Times Number One Bestseller and Humour Book of...)
[02:41:02] <kuudes> yeah, thats bad
[02:41:14] <galambo> all because the government wanted to negotiate on the prices of ppe and wanted a good deal in a pandemic, and then ordered the ppe to come by boat instead of a plane
[02:41:27] <kuudes> XD

[02:42:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> What lunatic thought to construct a test with that many concentration-requiring items in a row with no breaks?!
[02:42:49] <galambo> residents in singapore have it even worse. they are basically enslaved to their job.
[02:44:15] <galambo> so no the workload in the nhs is high and the resources are not great. its obviously much much worse in say egypt. in egypt doctos burn out very quickly because they feel responsible for the care but are unable to do much
[02:44:31] <galambo> we make do with what we can
[02:45:51] <galambo> and no medicine is very nuanced and the decision making is complex
[02:47:29] <galambo> I am actually fortunate that work conditions suck in the nhs. if work conditions in the nhs were great british doctors would not have left the uk and went to australia and new zealand
[02:47:45] <galambo> and I would not have had an opportunity to come in their place
[02:48:11] <galambo> which also makes you wonder why a doctor in a first world country would leave their friends and family and go to australia

[03:01:14] <galambo> kuudes, A patient comes to a doctor complaining of abdominal pain. After a thorough exam, doctor says “I have an idea but I need to run some tests first.” Patient agrees. Doctor places a cat on patient’s abdomen and after the cat paces up and down (no, that’s not the punch line), doctor leads in a dog that proceeds to sniff the patient’s ass. Doctor announces that the patient has (fill-in-the-blank) disease and hands patient a bill
[03:01:14] <galambo> . Patient asks, puzzled,  “Doctor, I can understand your fee, and I can understand the charge for the CAT scan, but what’s this other charge for the dog? Doctor replies, “Oh, that’s for the lab test.”

I and another one of the guys (also vaccinated) got it a few days later, most likely from one of those girls (and not our partners, who both tested negative). …)
[09:10:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah, what I'm seeing and hearing here is also increasingly hard to square with the supposed effectiveness numbers
[09:13:22] <rmmh> infection chance for the vaxed people at a party isn't independent-- if they're exposed to a strain that the vaccine doesn't protect (symptomatically) against, it's likely to be similar for everyone
[09:15:33] <nshepperd2> plus variation in the amount of viruses shed by the patient 0 at that party
[09:16:46] <nshepperd2> the obvious next step here though imo is to try just giving people all the vaccines at once and see if it works bettter
[09:17:19] <saturn2> rmmh: if so, that strain is going to completely take over before long, so not much comfort
[09:19:05] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[09:20:01] <nshepperd2> since it's highly likely that at least some of the vaccine effectiveness being less than 100% is due to whether an individual person responds to a specific vaccine or not
[09:21:22] <rmmh> reduction to common cold is decent

[13:04:16] <PapuaHardyNet> been idling on EleutherAI discord
[13:05:55] <SDr> looking from that pov into here, hn, (to a lesser degree lw), and basically the vast majority of unfiltered net, what strikes me is how the vast majority of stuff posted is designed to make you think in specific ways. There's inoculation bias, automatic pattern-matching (of not very uplifting patterns), and a vast palette of neurosis-inducing stuff
[13:07:08] <adiabatic> sounds like you need to get on urbit and, separately, find a good gemini browser
[13:07:10] <SDr> ("WTF neurosis?"  <-  1, is it bad? 2, can you do something about it?      if yes and no, then the mindset that it compels is that of being depressed and non-actioning)

[13:08:41] <PapuaHardyNet> seems really interesting, aside from the "Your Urbit ID is a username, network address, and crypto wallet.
[13:08:44] <PapuaHardyNet> "
[13:09:57] <SDr> adiabatic, tbh, things that are performing _really really well_ are (small) discord communities for vibing, and 1-on-1 videoconferencing for professional stuff
[13:10:24] <SDr> mostly because people there don't bring their shit in
[13:10:42] <adiabatic> stupid question of the day: what's "vibing"?
[13:10:59] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: did you just find out about urbit?
[13:11:06] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: yes
[13:11:10] <saturn2> cool
[13:11:48] *** Joins: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[13:12:07] <SDr> vibing is when you're enjoying yourself, socially, whatever that means to you. Used as a verb: ya'all are vibing on toxoplasma, and that's not my vibe. I'm vibing on getting headpats in vr :P
[13:12:35] <saturn2> https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vibing
[13:12:35] <Robomot> Urban Dictionary: vibing (1. hanging, doing nothing, chilling 2. listening to music.)
[13:13:19] <adiabatic> the thing about UD is that generally you need someone else to point to a particular entry in it to explain what he means; any given term has a bunch of mostly-nonoverlapping definitions
[13:14:07] <saturn2> most english words have a bunch of mostly-nonoverlapping definitions
[13:14:13] <adiabatic> eh, point
[13:15:58] <SDr> anyways, short version is, that I've flipped the bozo bit on vast majority of reality, esp online media and everything downstream of that, and am currently scoring top on the evaluation criterias I have set myself.
[13:16:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I still do not understand what "vibing" means
[13:16:20] *** Quits: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[13:16:28] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: it seems like the wrong part of speech
[13:16:56] <adiabatic> maybe a clearer, if annoyingly long, way of putting it would be "soaking up the social atmosphere"
[13:17:08] <PapuaHardyNet> yep
[13:17:55] <adiabatic> the term "vibing" makes it seem like an active action, though, which seems fantastically misleading
[13:18:21] <PapuaHardyNet> https://www.gasnow.org/
[13:18:21] <Robomot> GAS NOW - 基于待处理交易的 ETH GasPrice 预测系统 (Gas Now — ETH GasPrice forecast system based on Pending Transaction Mempool)
[13:18:48] <PapuaHardyNet> seems like a rather useful website if you like playing with ETH (not that I recommend it) - it gives you live gas prices for ETH transactions
[13:19:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: What does it mean to "soak up the social atmosphere" ... also this seems not to be consistent with how SDr used the term
[13:20:09] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps an example would be helpful for you to understand
[13:20:14] <adiabatic> like, say I were just a lurker here
[13:20:20] <adiabatic> people here talk like I do
[13:20:29] <adiabatic> they have basically the same outgroups as I do
[13:20:51] <adiabatic> they agree with me on what kinds of silly shit is going on out in the world
[13:21:00] <adiabatic> this is comforting
[13:21:16] <adiabatic> and low-level background-anxiety reducing
[13:21:47] <saturn2> "i know now why you are non-contrarian. but it is something i can never do."
[13:22:33] <adiabatic> if and when I do chime in, I don't need to front (i.e. put up as much of a façade) as I would if I were in some sort of nominally-open-minded bunch of left-wingers who don't know statistics or biology
[13:23:58] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a pretty good description
[13:24:31] <PapuaHardyNet> also I think "vibing" also includes low signal participation like adding emojis or saying... uh, Poggers, or whatever people do these days on Discord
[13:24:50] <adiabatic> I dropped 1.95 (it's complicated) Discords once I stumbled over a separate discord with a vibe that matches mine
[13:25:19] <PapuaHardyNet> the point of low signal is that it reduces the threshold of investment required to participate and feel a part of the social scene
[13:26:14] <PapuaHardyNet> 0.05 discord servers = I assume you created your own room and moved a few people into it
[13:26:58] <adiabatic> Opposite. Muted all the channels and the Discord itself, but at-mentions of my nick break through. I've had a surprising number of them recently.
[13:27:33] <adiabatic> (my own private server, I created years back and there are a tiny handful of people in it, but basically nothing happens in there)
[13:28:22] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, keeping a community alive isn't easy
[13:29:02] <adiabatic> plus everyone there would rather interact with me in the respective source discords that we have in common
[13:29:41] <adiabatic> which is…not unreasonable
[13:29:52] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess communities need to be focused around specific topics that bind everyone together, instead of people - unless you are a content creator
[13:30:09] <SDr> gwern, https://www.gwern.net/CYOA is poggers though, lmk if anyone does a beta release :)

I propose that if we turn them into Choose Your Own Adventure hypertext games, they become feasible and enable new gameplay.)
[13:31:40] <adiabatic> well, for the Discord that I 95% dropped, I sort of drifted away from everyone else on the main focus (vidya) and everyone else is some combination of moving left and/or dropping the mask
[13:32:01] <PapuaHardyNet> moving left? left-wing politics?
[13:32:06] <adiabatic> yes
[13:32:35] <PapuaHardyNet> video game discords are mainly right-wing? that's news to me
[13:32:59] <adiabatic> uh, mu
[13:33:07] <PapuaHardyNet> k
[13:34:04] <adiabatic> I'd be fine with it if I were regularly playing games with these guys, but I'm not, so after hearing _glowing_ reviews of this one streamer and then I finally watch him and he's basically blood-libeling his perceived enemies
[13:34:13] <adiabatic> I'm like
[13:34:25] <adiabatic> "do I want to care about these people anymore as a group"
[13:34:28] <adiabatic> "…no"
[13:34:54] <adiabatic> and the nice thing is, the sheer repugnance of the guy they were stanning pretty much completely broke me of missing them
[13:35:09] <PapuaHardyNet> so they are people with bad taste and are bigoted, not right-wing. Looks like I was right, most discord servers suck
[13:35:16] <adiabatic> otherwise this would be even more of an agonizing decision than it was
[13:36:00] <adiabatic> well, I'm in the just-want-to-grill party
[13:36:03] <adiabatic> we get creamed
[13:36:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm sorry, is that an innuendo?
[13:36:31] <adiabatic> no
[13:36:37] <PapuaHardyNet> i have no idea what you are saying

[13:37:14] <Robomot> Why is Everything Liberal? - by Richard Hanania - Richard Hanania's Newsletter (Cardinal Preferences Explain Why All Institutions are Woke)
[13:39:40] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, I see. just-want-to-grill is a reference to probably the Republican party. I'm not american, so I don't get the reference, but I think I get your point.
[13:40:35] <saturn2> no
[13:40:37] <adiabatic> oh, no. "party" is misleading, but "faction" isn't really better, since it's not really a faction. The sort of people who are politics-agnostic and/or don't let it infect all their social relationships.

[13:42:09] <PapuaHardyNet> i see
[13:42:11] <mjr> Yes, originally scheduled for Aug 4th
[13:43:35] <adiabatic> friday's a good day to get a second shot. if you feel like shit for a couple days it won't mess up work
[13:43:37] <mjr> But the local situation is such what with delta and supply and demand that they've started moving boosters up a bit for those in a hurry

[13:43:59] <adiabatic> damn
[13:44:25] <mjr> I didn't get almost any symptoms from the first shot so I'm hoping it won't be _too_ bad this time around either (though yes I know, more likely to have noticable side effects now)

[13:45:45] <PapuaHardyNet> "Perhaps political activism is often a sign of a less well-adjusted mind or the result of seeking to fill an empty void in one’s personal life." ooh I like this take
[13:46:31] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: "they're not irreligious, they just treat their political opinions like a religion"

[19:26:40] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: The Tcl extension part of SQLite lives on.  Much of SQLite's open source test suite (it also has proprietary tests) is written in Tcl.  SQLite integrates with Tcl not quite perfectly, but pretty well -- IMO, better than with other scripting languages.  I have a (terribly written, ugh!) old blog post about it.

[21:03:03] <kuudes> hmm. so we needed about 1 bn shots for eu
[21:03:36] <kuudes> if the price of vaccine was put to 1000 e per piece, I guess the thing to do would have been to nationalize pfizer and astrazeneca
[21:03:51] <kuudes> ie just go to stock exchange with 500 bn e of stimulus money and buy all stocks
[21:04:14] <kuudes> but for some reason in western free market economies buying companies out of exchange to the government is shunned upon
[21:04:45] <kuudes> currently vaccines cost some 4 e/piece
[21:05:15] <kuudes> but somehow I feel even if the large blocs would have bought drug companies to themselves, that might still not have solved things that much faster
[21:05:22] <kuudes> or?

[21:21:31] <kuudes> well that is what the proposition of "lets pay 1000$ per shot" is
[21:21:43] <kuudes> so I guess we can't really pay that much per shot.
[21:21:55] <kuudes> can't, as in we can't nationalize them because then they would suck

[21:24:18] <ggreer> we want to pay more. each vaccine creates something like $2000 in economic value
[21:24:23] <ggreer> the pandemic cost the US trillions
[21:24:40] <kuudes> sure. then it is way cheaper to just buy out astrazeneca and pfizer from the stock exchange
[21:24:56] <kuudes> and then just tell them to produce you vaccines
[21:24:57] <ggreer> no it's not. every buyer needs a seller
[21:25:08] <ggreer> if the stock price is skyrocketing, why would I sell?
[21:25:13] <kuudes> because a law
[21:25:22] <ggreer> that's not buying and selling. that's called robbery
[21:25:30] <kuudes> confiscation for due price
[21:25:49] <kuudes> clearly acceptable in pandemic, as it is state of emergency

Halfway through the paper, and...
[21:26:39] <gwern> ...quite frankly, after a few glances at the Supplementary Information, I realised what was the secret sauce. The incredible performance of this network seems down to DeepMind’s superb engineering.'
[21:27:31] <gwern> 'each and every piece of the puzzle must have gone through many cycles of trial and error...One can only imagine how many architectures they discarded, or how many times they had to tweak an architecture until it finally worked.

[21:27:52] <kuudes> and well, enough money is enough money
[21:28:05] <kuudes> you don't need to confiscate if you are willing to pay enough
[21:28:09] <ggreer> clearly not. had we had a wealth tax 20 years ago, neither spacex nor tesla would exist
[21:28:12] <kuudes> 10x market price surely would seem to do
[21:28:13] <ggreer> and we'd all be far worse off
[21:28:47] <kuudes> like, qatar or whatnot tried to buy us harbors off the stock exchange with cash bills, and was prevented by us government because they would have been able to pull that off
[21:29:02] <Logos01> ggreer: Most of Musk's business model is offsetting costs with government subsidy if we're honest.
[21:29:29] <kuudes> iirc the bid was just some 200 bn$ for all us harbors or so
[21:29:35] <Logos01> SpaceX was largely founded on the basis of his demonstrating that the spreadsheets he presented to NASA about overspending on launches were in fact accurate. He could've done that at 1/10th the model scale.
[21:30:09] <Logos01> Tesla came well after SpaceX.  So I can't really agree that taxing his income from Paypal harder would've changed the history on SpaceX/Tesla.
[21:30:30] <kuudes> as current market valuation of pfizer is 200 G$, I would presume for 2000 G$ you would be able to buy it off
[21:31:19] <kuudes> I think uk sort of did something like that with astrazeneca, which is why eu is currently sending astrazeneca bill of some 1000 G$ or so

[21:36:15] <Logos01> That's from slightly before 1900CE.
[21:36:19] <ggreer> Logos01: they won the nasa contract after they got to orbit with their own money. in interviews, musk says they had maybe a couple weeks of money
[21:36:26] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: i think they have a ton of compute in comparison, yes
[21:36:35] <RiversHaveWings> and the model is bigger i think?
[21:36:57] <ggreer> had musk been a few million dollars poorer, they wouldn't have had enough money for the launch that got them into orbit
[21:38:07] <Logos01> ggreer: If Musk had been a few million dollars poorer going into it, he likely would've had a much lower ambition to use as his demonstration of economic feasibility from the outset.
[21:38:27] <ggreer> unlikely. the whole thing took far more money than he originally planned
[21:38:42] <Logos01> Well that's always the case.
[21:39:03] <Logos01> (Especially with anything he actually does.)
[21:39:14] <rmmh> ggreer: reminds me of https://priceonomics.com/how-a-lucky-run-in-vegas-saved-fedex/
[21:40:26] <Logos01> ggreer: I mean there were also divorce proceedings for him in 2008 that affected the whole thing.  But part of SpaceX's thing, initially, was him going out of his way to avoid government funding until he, well, didn't.
[21:40:55] <Logos01> So I mean, if he'd had half the cash going into it from the outset that he did, that would've been what he was scaled to I suspect.
[21:41:23] <ggreer> you can't believe that his chances would have been the same had he had half as much money
[21:41:43] <Logos01> Why not?
[21:42:37] <ggreer> had he had half as much money, I think his chances would be diminished by more than half. there are so many costs and he did so much of it as cheaply as possible. designing and manufacturing rockets is extremely expensive
[21:43:18] <Logos01> Oh I don't disagree there.  But I think you're really underselling how much smaller-scale his ambitions *could* have been for the purposes of demonstrating his claims.
[21:43:20] <ggreer> and even with all the funds, it took what... 4 launches before they got to orbit?
[21:43:38] <Logos01> He would have had to do something much less ambitious than sending something into orbit for example.
[21:43:44] <rmmh> https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC/status/1417432080284372992
[21:43:45] <ggreer> he scaled it down to the smallest possible thing that could get to LEO

[21:43:58] <Logos01> ggreer: Again the focus on orbit. This is precisely my point.
[21:44:21] <Logos01> We both are in agreement that actually getting into orbit is hard.
[21:44:37] <ggreer> rmmh: I fucking hate people on twitter right now. they're basically encouraging rich people to chill out and buy fancy yachts instead
[21:44:40] <Logos01> Where we are in disagreement is in the notion that only by getting to orbit could Musk have successfully gotten NASA to fund SpaceX.
[21:45:12] <ggreer> well they launched 3 times before that and NASA didn't give them a contract
[21:45:22] <Logos01> Because they were aiming for LEO.
[21:47:52] <Logos01> In any case there's no real way to prove this one way or the other because the actual history is what it is, so this isn't a hill worth dying on for either of us I think.
[21:48:06] <Logos01> What *IS* absolutely true is that nationalizing SpaceX would be terribad and dumb.
[21:48:40] <Logos01> And all those people yelling at the billionaires to "chill out and buy fancy yachts instead" don't understand how much good can come from commercial space travel.

The question that remains is what the real-world likelihood is of an untrained person getting a perfect seal. For this, we defer to 
[22:49:06] <kuudes> standardized Respirator assigned protection factors (APFs), which convert rated filtration efficiencies to the expected real-world decrease of the concentration of inhaled contaminants, based on studies in the workplace. For our P100 estimate, we choose to use the higher protection value of 20x from the UK FFP3 mask, rather than the 10x value used in the US, because the US value is assuming a truly grueling "worst case" - work in the polluted atmosphere

In his vision, which he called “Mrs. Datefire,” a man hoping to date a woman would first meet her while dressed in “Mrs. Doubtfire”-style prosthetics. It was canned, he said, partly because human prosthetics look realer on camera than...
[22:53:39] <gwern> ...they do to the naked eye — in person, Mr. Welton said, “you can kind of feel something’s wrong” — and partly because the men in the test footage could not convincingly portray elderly women.'

[23:01:12] <nshepperd> for that there seem to be various options: you could require input dependent proof of work (but that makes running expensive)
[23:01:34] <gwern> ggreer: I'm mostly wondering what sort of IDE has bugs that can make opening project files take 6 hours when it can take <5min
[23:01:54] <ggreer> really basic ones. those people don't understand algorithmic complexity
[23:02:19] <gwern> ironic. the cobbler's children go unshod
[23:02:32] <nshepperd> accidental quadratics are a hell of a drug

[23:02:59] <ggreer> I wonder who made those statues. they seem a little subversive considering the venue
[23:03:48] <dbohdan> Are they mostly front end people?  Do they tend to be "Photoshop web designers" who learned to code?

[23:06:02] <ggreer> never a coding bootcamp person though. they teach algorithmic complexity there
[23:09:27] <vrs> I don't fully understand why you'd get into programming but not enjoy optimizing cycles
[23:09:53] <vrs> or I do, but it's emotionally foreign to me
[23:11:04] <nshepperd> an upload could require proof of work deferred to a blockchain before accepting input. that saves you a bunch of computation at the cost of only being able to receive missives from the outside world at the block latency
[23:11:53] <ggreer> solve 100 captchas before asking me a question
[23:11:53] <nshepperd> and you need some sort of fallback in case the cryptocoin dies

[23:18:07] <nshepperd> a very brave option would be to only accept input that appears in a bitcoin block within n of the last one, which prevents replay attacks entirely, after a certain period of time
[23:18:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Uh ... perhaps. It wouldn't quite be straightforward. But why? Is this specifically to prevent LW frontpage dumps?
[23:18:36] <nshepperd> but also leaves you open to dying of a network outage
[23:18:41] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: in part, but I think it'd be nice in general. I was thinking about how to dripfeed gwernpastes too
[23:18:58] <nshepperd> catern: sure, if you trust someone on the outside
[23:19:02] <gwern> nshepperd: if there's a network outage, then people won't see the regular printing either
[23:19:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, but is that implementation really what you want? It's not exactly a "drip", rather the opposite: a dam breaking ...
[23:19:58] <catern> nshepperd: I mean, this is generalizable to include your suggestion too - you could have a smart contract, and do a challenge-response to that smart contract
[23:20:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> The moment there's been no chat for X time, bam: everything gets posted. Right?
[23:20:20] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: no, I meant, print 1 item; this is then activity, so the delay kicks back in

[23:25:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole point is to post things when they get posted
[23:25:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> If they're posted in the middle of the night, that makes the RSS feed posting kind of moot
