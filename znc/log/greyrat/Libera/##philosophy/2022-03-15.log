[14:14:27] <Lumine> Lisp
[14:16:30] <pussipupu> ah, my favourite family
[14:16:39] <pussipupu> Common Lisp, Scheme?
[14:17:23] <Lumine> I started with Emacs Lisp to learn the ecosystem that's now imbedded into my every day workflow, after that comes CL
[14:17:56] <Lumine> I have tons of books for them

[15:13:47] <Lumine> pussipupu I have a nice quote for you
[15:14:03] <pussipupu> even if it's programming language talk?
[15:14:16] <Lumine> “Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below.”* -Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming
[15:14:48] <pussipupu> Hehe, I do enjoy those old quotes
[15:16:04] <causative_> yeah lisp has too many parens and they are too hard to type
[15:17:35] <Lumine> What makes them easier to type is coffee!
[15:17:58] <causative_> habitually I type parens with my right pinky on shift, it's not ergonomic
[15:19:07] <causative_> other annoying thing about lisp is the excessive indentation, writing diagonally
[15:20:07] <causative_> and you have like progn and let blocks, where other languages don't need to write anything to get the same effect
[15:21:22] * Lumine uninstalls everything
[15:21:28] <causative_> python is a better lisp than lisp
[15:21:53] <Lumine> Okay you lost me there
[15:22:36] <causative_> well it has functions as first class objects, and GC, and less cramped looking syntax
[15:22:47] <causative_> basically a lisp
[15:23:07] <Lumine> If I knew anything about python, I would probably come with few counterarguments
[15:24:23] <Lumine> The only thing I know about it is that it has a noob check in regards to indents
[15:24:27] <causative_> the main thing lisp has that python does not, is the macros, but honestly macros are a pain to debug and modern functional languages like haskell have moved away from them
[15:25:35] <causative_> you don't really *need* macros for anything
[15:29:54] <causative_> I use emacs as well but I don't write a lot of emacs lisp
[15:30:11] <causative_> just a little to configure things
[15:31:11] * arryana pushes lunch over to pussipupu and lumine
[15:32:07] <Lumine> Thanks
[15:32:10] <causative_> lisp was once very innovative with passing around functions and closures as parameters
[15:32:17] <causative_> but a lot of languages do that now
[15:32:58] <pussipupu> Python's syntax is very ugly and messy to be, I value regulatory and elegance
[15:33:08] * pussipupu slides arryana a nice cappuccino
[15:33:14] <arryana> oooh, ta
[15:33:17] <pussipupu> *to me
[15:33:31] <Lumine> I agree, Lisp is beautiful
[15:33:45] <arryana> i don't think i've had a cappuccino since i was in my 20s
[15:34:00] <pussipupu> I've not made one in ages, I miss it
[15:34:12] <pussipupu> but not enough to go back to working in a coffee shop
[15:34:15] <Lumine> I'm just having regular coffee
[15:34:25] <causative_> it's more beautiful to write nothing than to write a ton of parens
[15:34:36] <causative_> python replaces the parens with nothing, for the same result
[15:34:55] <causative_> and doesn't indent so much that you get stressed about formatting when you write a moderately long function
[15:35:19] <Lumine> If you're in emacs you know that there's a package to format things automatically
[15:35:32] <Lumine> So you don't have to sweat that stuff
[15:35:47] <causative_> you do because if you're twelve indents deep it looks like crap
[15:35:54] <causative_> wrapping around the page
[15:36:13] <Lumine> Well I haven
[15:36:16] <causative_> lisp forces you to write only tiny functions, which ok is *a* design choice but not always the most convenient one
[15:36:20] <Lumine> 't gotten that deep yet
[15:39:02] <causative_> homoiconicity is nice for teaching compilers, I guess, but in modern practice it doesn't matter - just use JSON
[15:39:38] <Lumine> Got it, you don't like Lisp
[15:40:48] <pussipupu> Lisp doesn't force one to write only tiny functions, whitespace != nothing, <3 metaprogramming by macro
[15:41:02] <causative_> well, it's not that lisp is bad per se, it has all the features you want behind the scenes, it's that there are modern languages that do the same thing better
[15:41:29] <causative_> your lisp program has more whitespace than the corresponding pythong program pussipupu due to the indentation style of lisp
[15:42:22] <pussipupu> It doesn't have the features I want though
[15:42:41] <pussipupu> It has the features you want and I hope you're very happy together
[15:44:30] <pussipupu> Excel has lambda now, just as an aside
[15:45:31] * Lumine is going to make a game in Excel
[15:46:24] <pussipupu> There's a lot I dislike about Excel qua Excel, but spreadsheets are an interesting programming paradigm
[15:46:36] <causative_> I don't know too much about excel but it is kind of appealing to have all your data arranged in tabular form

[15:53:59] <Lumine> Now I'm learning Lisp because it's fun, not only because my tools use it. And I'm not expecting to get a job with it. Nor am I running for one.
[15:54:20] <causative_> C++ has changed a lot in the past 20 years
[15:55:08] <pussipupu> It's a real shame Web stuff is done in three languages instead of one Lisp :p
[15:55:41] <Lumine> It's also a shame that JS is the only choice for front-end
[15:55:57] <assan> hah
[15:56:02] <assan> all this shaming
[15:56:10] <assan> shame on who?
[15:56:48] <assan> i think it's shame on you complaining but can't change anything really, but hey am probably stupid
[15:57:35] <Lumine> Complaining about things you can't change is probably the only reason to complain
[15:58:08] <causative_> it is good that there is a separation between JS and HTML - if they were the same language then I could see it being more difficult to block scripts in the browser
[15:59:38] <causative_> often times the important thing is not what a language *can* do, but what the user can be guaranteed that it *can't* do. HTML by itself can't do arbitrary scripting, it's just a static page, and that's a useful property
[16:00:26] <assan> complaining is for the defeated
[16:00:50] <assan> instead of complaining send me some bit coins to smoke some crackers
[16:01:24] <assan> i think that's a better use of money
[16:01:25] <assan> haha
[16:01:41] <assan> but hey, i probably don't know stuff like that
[16:01:51] <causative_> what I really want in a language doesn't exist yet though
[16:03:24] <causative_> main thing is, that over and over again, different languages and different frameworks solve the same problem:  moving requested data from a source A to a destination B
[16:03:48] <assan> okay
[16:03:48] <assan> so let's move on
[16:03:48] <assan> develop the new language and launch it to the free world
[16:04:23] <causative_> and the solution to this problem takes different interfaces, even different languages, depending on what kind of data you want to move and where you want to move it
[16:05:28] <causative_> we need a language that solves this problem of "data motion" once and for all, in a single unified syntax that can be implemented under the hood for each specific case
[16:07:01] <assan> i can't relate
[16:07:05] <assan> am hungry
[16:07:16] <assan> i need food not computer language
[16:07:27] <assan> when you say we, what you mean?
[16:07:37] <causative_> the programming world
[16:08:25] <assan> okay i see
[16:08:31] <assan> well, i don't know
[16:08:41] <assan> i wish the programmers success
[16:08:57] <assan> i hear ai would be incharge of the earth soon
[16:10:02] <causative_> if a program wants a piece of data, X, then the program shouldn't have to care *where* it gets X from - from a database? from the user? from a flat file? from a web service? The program shouldn't have to care. It should just get X from *somewhere* and do what it was going to do with X.
[16:10:20] <causative_> the details of where X is coming from should be separated from the question of what you're going to do with X
[16:10:57] <causative_> this allows you to write your program *once* and then use it in many different data contexts
[16:11:25] <causative_> by hooking the same program up to different data sources
[16:11:42] <causative_> each of which is capable of providing X, but in different ways
[16:14:40] <assan> okay
