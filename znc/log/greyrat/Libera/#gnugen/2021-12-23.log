[15:08:19] <jonas[m]> next level of how to hand in your (coding) project:
[15:08:19] <jonas[m]> use your ci system to automatically generate the wanted export zip archive and upload it to the submission server on every push to the main branch :D
[15:10:13] <afontain[m]> CI&CD :P
[15:11:03] <jonas[m]> exactly :D
[15:12:04] <jonas[m]> it only stops being Continuous Delivery once the submission form closes ðŸ™ƒ
[15:14:24] <afontain[m]> yeah, I was going to say that this is a good way to push something too fast
[15:14:40] <afontain[m]> and it's like the usual thing that can happen with CD :P
[15:15:33] <jonas[m]> obviously :D

[18:24:14] <artectrex[m]> I've done this for some projects, it's not worth the effort though haha
[18:24:50] <artectrex[m]> https://xkcd.com/1205/
[18:31:24] <jonas[m]> yes, but it was still fun to do it ðŸ˜‚
[19:24:52] <afontain[m]> wait, you actually did it ?
[19:28:36] <jonas[m]> yes :D
[19:28:36] <jonas[m]> it's not that complicated actually... I already had the CI template from the last project for generating the zip archive... then it was as simple as adding another job only executed on the main branch which uploads the zip using curl
[20:04:30] <sunyibo> merry Christmas, y'all
[22:49:27] <afontain[m]> you're tomorrow already? merry christmas then!
[23:08:29] <CedricHlzl[t][m]> god jul :)
