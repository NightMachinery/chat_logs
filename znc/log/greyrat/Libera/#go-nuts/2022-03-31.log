[00:05:30] <nagylzs> Hello, can somebody please tell me if pointer write and read operations are atomic in golang? I can protect them with mutexes, but I don't want to if it is not required.
[00:06:29] <bpalmer> see also sync/atomic's LoadPointer and StorePointer
[00:06:32] <lungaro> It's not atomic. Check out the atomic package too, beyond sync/mutex
[00:06:44] <bpalmer> they aren't necessarily atomic
[00:06:44] <nagylzs> Okay, thanks

[00:40:03] <b0nn> Oh, they left - I was going to mention that there are some lockfree things done in Go (but I believe that they are slower than stuff that uses locks) and example is https://github.com/dustinxie/lockfree
[00:41:15] <b0nn> That project does have the following caveat attached "The term "lock-free" does not mean the implementation is entirely without lock, but that the heavy-lifting workloads of adding/modifying an entry in the map is done without the need to lock the entire map. A read lock is still used to acess the buckets of map, but this is much more lightweight and efficient than locking the entire map for every
[00:41:21] <b0nn> insert/modify operation."

[01:45:11] <dostoyevsky2> kinda like the maxminddb: mmap'ed file, accessed lockfree, because you can't actually change it... Might be a good data structure for my DNS server
[01:46:17] <SJrX> I want to create a command line interface tool, not unlike say the go tool, where you have a bunch of different commands and each command is kind of "pluggable", or doesn't require changes to the rest of the code to support it, just create a new type and you are done. In Java you can use something like SPI for this. I'm guessing looking at the source for the go tool, this isn't idiomatic / possible in go.
[01:46:17] <SJrX> Since there they just have a giant array.  https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/main.go#L47
[01:48:32] <dostoyevsky2> SJrX: a simple switch statement, based on executable name is much easier to understand, imho... makes what structs/packages implement what commands more straightforward
[01:50:12] <dostoyevsky2> But I guess Java devs won't feel at home unless they have their CommandExecutionAbstractFactoryForestFacadeSingleton

[01:57:46] <SJrX> dostoyevsky2, well I mainly just wanted a way to discover the commands without having to modify some global array, but I suppose it isn't the end of the world.
[01:58:10] <bpalmer> SJrX: just change the array to a subcommands package with a hashtable, have a new package that has an init() to register itself, and import your new package in main
[01:58:33] <bpalmer> looking at a giant array of things is about the simplest way of discovering commands I can think of. They're literally all there
[01:58:52] <b0nn> Yeah - there's no magic way to discover what is a command and what isn't
[01:59:32] <bpalmer> using some form of type-based dependency injection, on the other hand, hides things
[01:59:58] <dostoyevsky2> SJrX: you can do that with reflection, similar to Java but the code is just not easy to maintain, hard to understand what's going on.. for a simple command -> code mapping

[13:54:38] <bpalmer> dostoyevsky2: yes, a TestMain or equivalent that sets up the database and some middleware to handle setting up/clearing tables/views/stored procedures would probably be a good idea for db-heavy code.
[13:57:23] <b0nn> These are integration tests; IME postgres is fast copying fixtures and it sounds like you have candidated for "Test these against this instance" and "Test these others against this other instance" which is parallelisable
[13:57:37] <b0nn> candidates*

[16:56:54] <siXy> It won't. But you can reset back to the original period, so it will essentially start again from the point you called reset.
[16:58:07] <Cork> siXy: ya, the problem is i need a bunch of them (for cleaning lists of requests in a bunch of structs). And i want to delay starting it until the list isn't empty
[16:59:49] <siXy> You can do something like https://go.dev/play/p/jwEOO6PR4rV is what I mean.
[17:00:09] <siXy> So you create it and imediately stop it, then reset when you need
[17:00:33] <Cork> ah, nice that is exactly what i'm trying to do
[17:00:34] <Cork> thx!
[17:00:35] <siXy> It's not perfect though, as theoretically you could get a single tick through between creating and stopping
[17:01:07] <Cork> time.Second => time.Minute should solve that though
[17:01:30] <Cork> i a thread gets paused for a minute there are more serious problems :)
[17:01:47] <siXy> *nod* yeah - it's still technically a race, but probably good enough for any real world usecase
[17:02:08] <fizzie> If you don't ever receive from the channel before, can you actually still get a tick out of it after calling Stop()?
[17:02:43] <Cork> fizzie: yes, it is even documented
[17:02:55] <siXy> fizzie: It uses a buffered channel
[17:03:09] <Cork> https://pkg.go.dev/time#Timer.Stop
[17:04:01] <fizzie> That (documentation) is for Timer, not Ticker, but fair enough.
[17:04:21] <Cork> they works basically the same so ya

I'm aware that there are terminal escape codes, but can people point me to recommendations for where to look for go on colored output. And additionally I'm curious as to a "fast" way to do this in go, can I just find some lexer for json in go?

[17:56:58] <siXy> SJrX: There's a MarshallIndent function to format it nicely. For the colours, I'd just pick some commonly used terminal colours and print it out with fmt.Printf, but you can probably find a third party package to make this neater if you want
[17:58:39] <SJrX> siXy, but how will fmt.Printf know to color different json elements differently?
[17:59:26] <ikke> fmt.Printf does not know
[18:02:07] <siXy> oh yeah if you want to colour the individual bits you'll need to write a custom marshaller, unless there's a 3p thing that does this already

[22:45:30] <nagylzs> primary *config.PostgreSQLConnection
[22:45:54] <nagylzs> This pointer is written from a go routine, and I'm trying to read it this way
[22:45:56] <nagylzs> return (*config.PostgreSQLConnection)(atomic.LoadPointer(c.nearest))
[22:46:24] <nagylzs> return (*config.PostgreSQLConnection)(atomic.LoadPointer(c.primary))
[22:46:37] <nagylzs> I got a compiler error
[22:46:49] <nagylzs> cannot use c.primary (variable of type *config.PostgreSQLConnection) as *unsafe.Pointer value in argument to atomic.LoadPointer
[22:47:07] <nagylzs> Isn't unsafe Pointer compatible with any pointer?

[23:03:37] <nagylzs> invalid operation: cannot take address of ((unsafe.Pointer)(c.nearest)) (value of type unsafe.Pointer)

[23:08:38] <seebs> you may need to make an intermediate object of the actual unsafe.Pointer type, and do the conversion separately.
[23:09:11] <seebs> i haven't actually *tried* the atomic stuff on pointers, because honestly it's almost certainly the wrong thing to do?
[23:09:57] <nagylzs> Maybe you have a better suggestion. This is a field in a struct that is written periodically from a go routine. There is another go routine that periodically reads it.
[23:10:21] <nagylzs> Read operation is much more frequent than the write part. So I cannot use a chan here.

[23:22:53] <seebs> the problem is you can't directly read from or write to a thing that isn't an unsafe.Pointer using the atomic LoadPointer/StorePointer.
[23:23:21] <nagylzs> I'm not sure why. It is already unsafe. :-D
[23:23:41] <nagylzs> Is there another way to read and write a pointer to a struct, in a thread safe way?
[23:23:49] <seebs> so you need the actual data storage you care about to be an unsafe.Pointer, and then you can do "p1 := atomic.LoadPointer(&unsafePointer); p2 := (*config.PostgreSQLConnection)(p1)"
[23:23:59] <seebs> the short answer is, this is nonsensical
[23:24:01] *** Joins: mikoto-chan (~mikoto-ch@213.177.151.239)
[23:24:14] <seebs> you shouldn't be reading or writing a pointer that could be changed, in general
[23:24:27] <seebs> you should be using locking, or channels, or *something* to ensure that all operations are properly ordered
[23:24:52] <nagylzs> The reader does not care if it reads an old (obsolete) value.
[23:25:10] <nagylzs> It really does not matter, if it reads the new value now, or some seconds later...
[23:25:28] <nagylzs> I can put these between locks, of course.
[23:26:00] <seebs> yeah. i'd probably do that. the atomic stuff is useful if you actually *need* unlocked access, and in that case, you'd be using a thing of type unsafe.Pointer as the thing you store in the struct, and converting that value *after* reading it.
[23:26:31] <nagylzs> I just tought that LoadPointer could have been implemented as an atomic CPU instruction at low level, so I was hoping that I would not need a lock for this.
[23:27:09] <nagylzs> Well, I'll just use locks, thanks! :-)
[23:27:13] <fizzie> Just FTR, the *syntax* error was from trying to write `(*unsafe.Pointer)p1` rather than `(*unsafe.Pointer)(p1)`. Conversions don't look like C casts. But that's just the syntax bit.
[23:27:40] <nagylzs> Thank you again! :-)

[23:30:13] <seebs> It probably is an atomic CPU instruction, but it still has to be a semantically valid operation.
[23:30:54] <seebs> A thing that needs a pointer to unsafe.Pointer really does need the thing it's given to be a pointer to an unsafe.Pointer. The conversion of *T to unsafe.Pointer is valid for arbitrary T, but that doesn't make **T convert to *unsafe.Pointer

[23:36:33] <fizzie> You *could* convert a **T to *unsafe.Pointer via a plain unsafe.Pointer, though. ;) I don't think that'd be quite kosher, but it empirically speaking works: https://go.dev/play/p/C_RQtu8WoBB
[23:36:34] <nagylzs> I'm not sure how garbage collection works in golang. If it uses reference counting, then I should be able to create another reference (e.g. read the pointer) to a struct in an atomic operation.
[23:36:49] <nagylzs> I think that it should be fine.
[23:37:12] <nagylzs> As long as the writer updates the pointer in the struct to a different struct, it should be safe.
[23:38:46] <nagylzs> The reader might then use an old version, but in my particular use case, it is not a problem at all.
