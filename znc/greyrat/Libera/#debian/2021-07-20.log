[00:02:19] <xx> PMT: there are a few *thousand* purely crash and bug and security fixes, with *zero* new functionality between the 7.0.4 version in debian and 7.0.6 in LTS version of libreoffice, and debian historically does not backport any of the patches
[00:02:43] <xx> instead people depend on the backports version, which is very rarely updated
[00:03:21] <xx> I'd almost say to remove libreoffice from debian, because unfortunately the maintainers do not have the time to maintain it, and instead use the LTS flatpak
[00:03:34] <randall> xx: It's quite possible that LO will be updated in a point release, but since none of those bugs are RC, they won't get fixed for the release.

[00:52:42] <xx> anyone know any of the chromium maintainers? This is a problem https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/update-your-chrome-browser-to-patch-new.html
[00:53:02] <xx> as well as all the other security CVEs in the two months since last chromium upload to debian
[00:57:09] <sney> chromium maintenance in debian is under-staffed and this is a known issue. however, browsers always have a lot of CVEs and chromium in particular is massive and complicated and takes forever to build/test (compile time is something like 6 hours on modern hardware), so it's not reasonable to expect constant catch-up with the CVE list 
[00:57:36] <sney> and it's been reported, #990079
[00:57:37] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/990079 in chromium (open, security, bullseye-ignore): «chromium: Update Chromium to 91.0.4472.114»; severity: grave; opened: 2021-06-19; last modified: 2021-07-17.

[01:14:56] <NthDegree> With Fedora, they gave up using the system-wide icu to make it build and just used the chromium-bundled version
[01:15:38] <NthDegree> and I found my biggest blocker after cleaning up the patches was some type issue with internationalisation files when compiling, which I would assume is down to icu

[01:29:30] <somiaj> xx: Yea, it would be nice if more places developed and matained LTS releases. Webbrowsers are an exeception, and even then cause lots of problems.
[01:29:30] <xx> oracle is not blocking anything - virtualbox is happily being updated in sid
[01:30:01] <NthDegree> xx: yes but will they allow custom patches under the virtualbox name to support it being used in Stable?
[01:30:10] <somiaj> xx: sid is not a release, debian cannot provide security support for a frozen version of virtualbox, hence it cannot be in a release (and as such cannot be in testing)
[01:30:28] <somiaj> even the virtualbox devs (at one time) said they would help backport fixes, but orcale's policy blocked that
[01:31:25] <xx> NthDegree: IceVirtualBox (name to be determined) is an option if the name was the only problem

[01:38:34] <ratrace> firefox has ESR, which is much closer to debian stable policies than chromium

[03:04:54] <kouett> I'm facing quite of a problem here, files in /tmp are deleted randomly but only for those which are no longer attached to processes
[03:05:14] <kouett> already deactivated systemd-tmpfiles timer but it does nothing
[03:05:43] <kouett> the issue is still there
[03:05:44] <kouett> hadn't changed any nginx/systemd configuration in months, only did sec upgrades from time to time
[03:05:51] <ratrace> kouett: are you talking about files in paths like /tmp/systemd-private-<uuid>-<service name>  ?
[03:06:00] <kouett> no, only files in /tmp
[03:06:12] <kouett> my specific problem is that nginx proxy cache path gets deleted
[03:06:19] <kouett> same thing if I do it by hand
[03:06:54] *** Joins: Scotty_Trees (~Scotty_Tr@2601:89:c700:e650:df1b:1033:9569:da89)
[03:07:10] <ratrace> other than systemd namespaced /tmp dirs, and tmpfiles, I am not aware of a native, default method of automatic removal of files from /tmp. so it must be some custom service, script, rclocal or config
[03:07:43] <ratrace> there's php cleanup cron, but I assume you didn't configure nginx proxy cache inside dirs monitored by php ?
[03:08:34] <kouett> yeah I don't see anything else that could cause this deletion... the thing is that afaik I don't have any specific by-hand config to clear /tmp. and I don't have nginx configured for using proxy cache dirs monbitored by php (don't have php installed)
[03:09:08] <ratrace> kouett: and also, are you talking about nginx cache toplevel dir, or stuff inside it?
[03:09:31] <ratrace> nginx does have its own cache monitor processes that may go about and remove stale entries, depending on config

[03:11:07] <ratrace> welp, try chattr +i some file or dir and see if anything logs a complaint about being unable to remove it
[03:11:27] <kouett> ok, I'll do that and let you know
[03:11:54] <ratrace> kouett: btw "deactivated" the tmpfiles timer .. but did you stop it?
[03:12:29] <kouett> yes I did (thanks for the remainder)
[03:12:49] <ratrace> but then, without an explicit config under /etc/tmpfiles.d, it shouldn't do anything about files in /tmp
[03:13:20] <kouett> yes, and it's the by-default config
[03:13:51] <ratrace> kouett: also check if /tmp is bind-mounted somewhere into some namespace that is then wreaking havoc in it
[03:14:06] <kouett> aahhh, good hint, haven't checked this
[03:14:30] <kouett> btw I have nothing in the logs complaining about deletion in /tmp

[12:25:37] <ratrace> xx: what were those libreoffice bugs that annoyed you, if they're gonna stay in bullseye's libreoffice now?
[12:27:08] <xx> ratrace: wrong pptx display of some documents
[12:27:13] <xx> I'll find it, fixed in 7.0.6
[12:27:55] <xx> it was one of these https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Releases/7.0.6/RC1
[12:28:05] <xx> or could have been 7.0.5
[12:29:29] <ratrace> time to make amends, and learn to embrace and love the snap :/
[12:30:01] <xx> I just ended up using the official deb from LO https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/?type=deb-x86_64&version=7.0.6&lang=en-US
[12:30:09] <pasiz> never love the snap
[12:30:09] <xx> it works, and has LTS support straight from LO
[12:30:30] <pasiz> is debian going to windows binary style
[12:30:35] <ratrace> xx: then why not go for 7.3?
[12:30:49] <xx> ratrace: for the same reason I use debian, I like LTS stuff
[12:31:21] <xx> ratrace: wait, there's 7.3? I thought 7.1 was the lastest.
[12:31:29] *** Joins: OlCe (~user@lfbn-nic-1-123-149.w2-15.abo.wanadoo.fr)
[12:31:49] <xx> 7.0 is the LTS branch, 7.1 is the "fresh" branch
[12:32:32] <xx> pasiz: I mean, I already have to use various LTS releases from outside debian, because the LTS versions in debian are not updated
[12:33:07] <ratrace> xx: I'm trying to find that in official docs/wikis... do you have a link perhaps?
[12:33:42] <ratrace> all I found was that 7.1 was labeled "community" to , well basically this:  https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-libreoffice-tells-businesses-get-off-our-community-version-you-are-hurting-development/
[12:34:34] <xx> ratrace: the pptx bug? I think it was this one https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132368
[12:35:42] <ratrace> xx: yeah, my bad, 7.1 is latest, 7.2 and 7.3 are prerelease.... and already have wiki entries

[19:45:46] <BCMM> there's two different types of partitions IDs around. there's the GUID belonging to the partition itself, which is a GPT-specific thing, and there's the *filesystem* ID, which can be used on both MBR and GPT
[19:46:11] <PMT> I think I found the answer, and it's terrible. 
[19:47:06] <BCMM> (supported by most filesystems, but not always the same format. for example, NTFS "UUIDs" are not, in fact, UUIDs. they're much shorter.)
[19:49:19] <BCMM> you can see this if you run `blkid`. PARTUUID is the thing that doesn't work on MBR. UUID works fine.
[19:51:12] <BCMM> point is, the filesystem's UUID is stored in the filesystem's own metadata, not in the MBR
[19:51:29] <PMT> blkid appears to have noticed I had FS images on disk in precisely the wrong places and gotten upset that it saw multiple UUIDs as options.

[20:52:59] <BCMM> by the way, anbox itself is not, strictly, an emulator. it's a real android runtime, running on the Linux kernel (the debian kernel includes the features required by android)
[20:53:34] <f-a> oh, contrib
[20:53:43] <BCMM> if you need to run apps that only work on ARM on your amd64 desktop, you can install libhoudini inside anbox

[21:48:50] <somiaj> though we usually do it after the release, I see merit in slowly doing it leading up to the release (no easy answer)

[22:18:52] <PMT> Well, very simply, when "apt update" is run, it reaches out to that URL and looks for lists of what's available, and then your machine caches those lists locally, and when you ask it to install something, it will use the information from those lists to reach out and try to download the package.
[22:22:36] <PMT> In terms of how it handles multiple entries, it comes with its own default ideas about prioritization (you can examine "apt-cache policy" if you want), and you can override them with config files if you want.
[22:23:22] <thad_the_man> So apt updatge spiders everything in https://deb.debian.org/debian?
[22:23:39] <PMT> Not everything, no. It downloads a pregenerated list of what's there.
