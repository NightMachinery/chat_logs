[01:29:03] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[01:29:20] <ilikeyou> hey Jo
[01:29:35] <Joanna> What’s new?
[01:29:57] <ilikeyou> not much. just settling in with a cup of tea. you?
[01:30:38] <Joanna> Still sort of tired after fumbling with new ide
[01:31:39] <Joanna> I was trying to get a checkcombobox to have spin behavior when using arrow keys
[01:32:15] <ilikeyou> which ide
[01:32:28] <Joanna> I’m not sure why I suddenly had the desire for a spinning checkcombobox:)
[01:33:51] <Joanna> Pm
[01:36:54] <Joanna> I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even worry about if I don’t like the way things behave I just override the existing code. I find it and copy and modify
[01:39:45] <Joanna> ilikeyou:
[01:40:37] <Joanna> Command like stuff certainly is easier. I use if to test sqlite statements

[02:59:03] <nuclearg1> hey, someone in the #security channel directed me here for some advice. I am apologizing in advance for the long message and I hope you folks don't mind
[02:59:05] <nuclearg1> I'm looking to secure a VR client / server application in bulk in such a way where a web application given the serial numbers of all the headsets just enables them, setting some flag in the database tied to the headset. 
[02:59:07] <nuclearg1> Once enabled, I was thinking I establish some sort of protocol between the VR app and server. In my case, I figured the team would hard code some sort of public client id into the VR app. This key would then be used to send a request with the serial number using some sort of cryptographic magic so that the outgoing request contains nothing identifiable. Also, I'd liek to use a nonce so that each
[02:59:09] <nuclearg1> request cannot be replayed. If the serial number is valid and the client id corresponds to some private key only available on the server, then we are good to go
[02:59:11] <nuclearg1> I was just wondering if this approach is acceptably secure. I was thinking the attacker would need to reverse engineer whatever protocol is established on the client side to decipher the outgoing request. Also, ideally symbols would be stripped so it should be hard to get that public key i was talking about since it wouldn't be visible over the network
[02:59:13] <nuclearg1> I'm looking for advice on what sort of authentication dance can be used. I was thinking about going with the HMAC-SHA256 approach in my case for example with a client side generated nonce value
[02:59:15] <nuclearg1> I greatly appreciate the help in advance, and If I don't respond it's because I am away from the keyboard at the moment, but I'll be back shortly. 
[03:01:19] <catbeard> that really should have gone into a pastebin
[03:01:27] <catbeard> but gl!
[03:01:44] <nuclearg1> i really don't like using pastebin, but i agree i should have used something similar or an alternative and im sorry
[03:05:13] <Kraig> Debian pastezone.net ? I think is better than pastebin it doesn’t have advertisements
[03:10:34] <catbeard> kopy.io is cool too

[03:40:20] <Joanna> Haha yea
[03:40:35] <jessicara> updates 97% complete, forever, wonderful
[03:41:11] <Joanna> That was a funny article I think one of the links led to all sorts of cartoons about programming
[03:41:51] <Joanna> There is no such thing as finished when it comes to programming
[03:42:26] <Joanna> New ideas keep happening that need to be implemented
[03:42:48] <jessicara> well that's the first time i've had an update outright fail in fedora
[03:43:03] *** Joins: elkclone (~elkclone@user/elkclone)
[03:43:47] <Joanna> I haven’t tried to update fedora I don’t use it much but i would like to have a Linux app working some day
[03:44:33] <Joanna> I got it on dell laptop because I didn’t want windows 10
[03:45:20] <Joanna> It’s very hard to find laptops without win 10 apart from Apple
[03:46:14] <jessicara> generally there's a live cd/dvd/usb option for linux distros which can use to try it out first
[03:47:14] <Hydragyrum> dell does have lines of laptops that you can get with linux from the factory, as do companies like system76 and purism
[03:47:37] <Hydragyrum> but why bother, most people will just reinstall anyway to have their distro/setup exactly right anyway
[03:48:08] <jessicara> avoiding windows licencing makes sense if aren't going to use it
[03:48:18] <Joanna> Yea mine came with Ubuntu
[03:49:38] <Joanna> In dell website I had to search for Ubuntu to find the ones without win 10 it wasn’t possible to find with linux keyword. It’s like they are sort of hiding them
[03:49:40] <Hydragyrum> jessicara, yeah but many places you can get a computer with linux installed from factory you'll end up paying more than getting one with windows from a more mainstream manufacturer
[03:49:49] <jessicara> maybe
[03:50:09] <jessicara> i ended up paying less because well, windows licencing cost more than no-os
[03:50:20] <Hydragyrum> i.e. a purism laptop will cost 50-100% more than a dell with similar specs
[03:50:57] <jessicara> my experience with dell is they had weird hardware sometimes which was not quite right with drivers for more standard chips
[03:51:18] <Joanna> I know someone who once tried to put linux onto a Sony laptop and it was a disaster so I wanted to make sure the laptop could have linux by buying one with Linux and I believe red hat certified
[03:52:18] <Hydragyrum> there are a number of cases you can save by skipping out on windows licensing (i.e. framework laptops if you're already set on one of those, normal manufacturers that have an option to not get windows license, etc.), but often you can easily end up paying more by going to a lower-volume retailer that sells windowsless ones
[03:53:23] <jessicara> yeah, like when build the machine yourself
[03:53:31] <Hydragyrum> ig what it comes down to is if you can get without (licensed) windows from the same retailer will be cheaper, but if you have to go to a different company, you'll likely end up paying more
[03:53:34] <jessicara> and can just skip buying the licence
[03:54:04] <jessicara> although building yourself is more expensive during the shortage it seems
[03:54:08] <Hydragyrum> well, we are talking about laptops, and afaik the only "build-it-yourself" out of those is framework (which is really neat and I want)
[03:54:16] <jessicara> yeah
[03:54:22] <jessicara> not sure i'll be doing that with laptops yet
[03:54:27] <Joanna> I really don’t like Microsoft anymore I used to not mind it when all I cared about was gaming :)
[03:55:05] <Hydragyrum> for pcs I'm still thinking building is the best way, though if you can find a prebuilt with similar/good specs for cheaper, by all means
[03:55:36] <Joanna> I’ll never forgive Microsoft for trying to break my computer trying to upgrade windows 7 without my consent.
[03:55:36] <jessicara> yeah binary compatibility really keeps windows going
[03:55:52] <jessicara> can run games built in like 2000
[03:56:08] <jessicara> sometimes
[03:56:18] <Hydragyrum> I'll never forgive MS for putting non-optional spyware, adware, etc. in their OS that they make you pay for
[03:56:18] <jessicara> but generally it's surprisingly decent long long term compatibility
[03:56:32] <jessicara> yeah at least remove adware from paid versions..
[03:56:41] <jessicara> but apparently not
[03:57:30] <jessicara> i probably care more than is reasonable about gaming still
[03:57:35] <jessicara> particularly on linux
[03:58:01] <jessicara> it is good to see noita working almost perfectly with standard wine
[03:59:44] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[04:00:46] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: that too! The idea of them deciding when you should update!! It’s like the computer isn’t even yours anymore
[04:01:02] <Hydragyrum> it isn't...
[04:01:06] <jessicara> i get the idea, force these security updates out there
[04:01:19] <jessicara> but it's also become force the features out there
[04:01:35] <Hydragyrum> plain and simple, a windows machine isn't under your control anymore
[04:03:24] <Joanna> I guess you can disconnect it from internet to keep it from being remotely controlled . Maybe the newer windows just stops working if you do that ..
[04:03:47] <Hydragyrum> it'll *work*, but then you lose on most of the things you'd use windows for anyway
[04:04:13] <Joanna> I use windows for programming which works ok without internet
[04:04:41] <jessicara> it is kinda unfortunate windows 10 has to download compatibility stuff
[04:05:52] <Joanna> The thing about updates is you have to have trust and once that trust is broken that’s it.
[04:06:12] <Joanna> I once though all updates were better but not anymore
[04:06:30] <Joanna> Thought
[04:08:00] <Joanna> In general I wonder if updates bring more problems, it seems like they are more interested in adding new features instead of fixing old bugs.
[04:08:03] *** Quits: moose (~moose@user/moose) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:08:07] <jessicara> usually they are better
[04:08:15] <jessicara> just there is some real stinkers of mistakes in there
[04:08:44] <jessicara> so if go a long update path with tons to apply chances are very high will encounter one of those which breaks the process
[04:08:54] <Joanna> Anything that adds features definitely adds bugs
[04:09:09] <jessicara> there was one with windows 7 too, if started from pre-sp1
[04:09:40] <jessicara> there was one update which would neglect to tell you that you have to reinstall
[04:09:45] <jessicara> restart* i mean
[04:10:06] <jessicara> so if just going along applying all the updates it catches you off guard, every other one asks to restart if it has to
[04:10:07] <Joanna> Sometimes I really don’t want a bunch of new features I just am happy with things as they are
[04:10:25] <jessicara> if don't restart, you get stuck in a weird not right state where no future updates will apply correctly
[04:10:36] <jessicara> even though some will seem to if continue
[04:11:04] <jessicara> so it was like waiting until encounter that number then restart manually for all the time windows 7 was supported here
[04:11:09] <Joanna> That’s the scary thing about updates they can make you unable to use what worked fine before
[04:11:23] <jessicara> thankfully can reinstall
[04:11:36] <jessicara> it's just a pain to do so after so many updates over and over until figure this out
[04:11:38] <Joanna> And also the difficulty of undoing if you don’t like them
[04:12:03] <Joanna> Some maybe can’t be undone
[04:12:24] <Joanna> Especially on mobile devices
[04:16:29] <Joanna> One time I foolishly updated tower with the last update before it goes to paid subscription. And then I tried to start it and it said I had to upgrade my operating system which made me furious because it didn’t indicate that when I updated it. Luckily there was another copy of tower on another machine to copy. I think it’s important to always save software somewhere else before updating just in case
