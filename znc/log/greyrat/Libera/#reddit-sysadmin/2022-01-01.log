[01:05:40] <javi404> but is it really an inode problem?
[01:05:52] <catbeard> does `df -i` report 100% or high % for /

[01:06:03] <javi404> 81% see above

[01:06:10] <catbeard> yeah as long as it's not 100%
[01:06:15] <catbeard> then it's gonna be files
[01:06:22] <catbeard> you can drill down with ncdu to find exactly what's big
[01:06:34] <javi404> df -h shows me: /dev/sda3                   41G   41G   14M 100% /
[01:06:48] <javi404> drilling down
[01:06:57] <catbeard> make sure you use -xq btw, because that stays within the filesystem
[01:07:07] <catbeard> instead of e.g. including a /home partition into the calculations
[01:08:01] <javi404> so the largest thing in the larget folder /usr/share/locale/uk/LC_MESSAGES/libvirt.mo 1.4MiB
[01:08:10] <javi404> that file take up all the inodes?
[01:08:14] <javi404> something strange.
[01:08:26] <catbeard> you're not worry about inodes at this point
[01:08:41] <catbeard> inodes represent a descriptor for a file or directory or symlink, not the object itself
[01:08:47] <javi404> maybe this is something xfs specific
[01:09:05] <javi404> xfs filesystem by default on centos 8
[01:09:08] <catbeard> you'd generally start at the top of ncdu and work your way down the list of biggest directories
[01:09:20] <javi404> catbeard: yeah, that is where it took me, to that file.
[01:09:34] <catbeard> that can't be the largest file, or if it is, there's a lot of those and you just need more than 41G
[01:10:07] <catbeard> you said /usr was 4G, 1.4MiB file by itself deep in there can't be responsible for all that usage
[01:10:33] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i like to run `du -hd 1` and drill down 
[01:11:17] <javi404> so df -T
[01:11:19] <catbeard> maybe something like `find / -type f -size +10M -ls` will help too, if nothing appears go to +9M

[20:57:41] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> web3.0 isnt ready till firewalls support it imo
[20:58:21] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> till then its not gonna be permitted on virtually any corp network ðŸ˜¦
[20:58:39] <PrincessZoey> why would a corp need ethereum support? lol
[20:58:43] <PrincessZoey> unless they're doing NFT cancer
[20:58:57] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> talking about quic

[21:27:19] <catbeard> wow welcome to 2019
[21:27:22] <PrincessZoey> didn't http2 JUST come out? x.x
[21:27:30] <catbeard> http3 came out a while ago
[21:27:52] <catbeard> like within the last year or two
[21:28:10] <PrincessZoey> ah
[21:28:23] <catbeard> also it depends on which QUIC spec
[21:29:00] <technonerd> still no native support in openssl :(
[21:29:01] <catbeard> and whether you're taking advantage of SNI/ESNI/Link header combination/minification and other things
[21:29:20] <technonerd> good thing akamaiiii has patches
[21:29:28] <catbeard> but the keyneg is handled over UDP
[21:30:02] <catbeard> so that's definitely a load off some webservers to handle TLS overhead
[21:30:52] <catbeard> the ECH stuff CloudFlare is working on for that is kinda neat

[23:02:49] <catbeard> bro, so much thanks loop today
[23:02:52] <catbeard> just close the damn chat
[23:03:39] <catbeard> Church: just don't set your peering IP to your home IP, consumer ISPs frown upon that
