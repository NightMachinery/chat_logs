[01:52:04] <citrons> I'm not sure if that's the extent of it
[01:53:14] <citrons> putting finish as the first line of my syntax file makes it stop working, but the characters are still being highlighted

[07:11:56] <phy1729> vimgor: clipboard
[07:11:56] <vimgor> The * register corresponds to the X PRIMARY selection (pasted with <MiddleClick>), and the + register corresponds to the system clipboard (pasted with <C-v> or Edit->Paste). On windows, both registers are for the system clipboard. To use the clipboard in terminal vim, vim must be built with +clipboard
[07:12:21] <phy1729> That last bit means   vim --version    needs to show +clipboard not -clipboard
[07:13:55] <kaiser> ah okay, i have -clipboard
[07:14:00] <kaiser> so i need to compile vim from source?
[07:14:07] <phy1729> vimgor: tiny
[07:14:07] <vimgor> vim-tiny (Debian/Ubuntu) and vim-minimal (Red Hat/Fedora) are installed by default. They're built with a small feature set and usually lack all the nice stuff users want. Install at least vim-nox (Debian/Ubuntu) or vim-enhanced (RH/Fedora) for all the standard features. For gvim or clipboard support install vim-gtk/vim-gnome (Debian/Ubuntu) or vim-X11 (RH/Fedora).
[07:14:47] <kaiser> ah, i am on void linux

[12:10:34] <julius> romainl I did the full vimtutor, and read various cheat sheet on the web
[12:10:50] <romainl> that's not learning Vim
[12:11:01] <romainl> that's _avoiding_ learning Vim
[12:11:17] <romainl> 1. If you didn't already, do `$ vimtutor` as many times as needed to get the basics right.
[12:11:17] <romainl> 2. As instructed at the end of vimtutor, level up to the user manual `:help user-manual`. It will guide you progressively through *every* feature, from basic to advanced. This not a novel, go at your own pace, skip chapters, come back to them later, and, most importantly, experiment along the way.
[12:11:17] <romainl> 3. Keep an eye on anti-patterns and inefficient actions, find improvements, practice. Rinse. Repeat.
[12:12:14] <julius> romainl I did 1
[12:12:16] <julius> :p
[12:12:32] <romainl> good, that's 0.1% of the job

[23:42:42] <mm302> is there a way to replace long words with ... but show the original word if desired? I guess this boils down to see if it's possible for the buffer to be different from what's shown in the window
[23:43:12] <romainl> :h conceal
[23:43:13] <digmbot> :help conceal -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/syntax.txt.html#conceal
[23:44:21] <mm302> thanks romainl, can this also be applied to some lines, let's see to hide even rows, toggle them or hide odd rows?
[23:45:14] <mm302> I wonder if writing a vim plugin could allow doing that
[23:45:37] <romainl> no
[23:45:47] <romainl> but you can :h folds

[23:48:44] <mm302> folds is not ideal to hide one line every 2 though, basically I want to be able to hide some lines all at once, or select others all at once
[23:50:52] <mm302> based on an identifier in the second column, vimgrep could be an alternative but I wonder if writing a plugin I could do this better, more toggleable like a filter?
