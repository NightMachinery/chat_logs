[04:00:11] <neominimum> mzan: I'm a perpetual newbie even though I've been casually using CL for a few years, my style suck-- I mean, my style is unconventional due my solitary practice. I'm trying now to be more conventional, so it's been great to get some specific feedback. Thanks for your suggestions. I wonder what is the reason why TCO needs to be supported by the standard, I mistakenly thought it was an implementation detail. I think I get it though... If the
[04:00:11] <neominimum> standard doesn't require it then implementations may not implement it. Does that make recursive code non-portable? Although my understanding is the standard doesn't require compilers to be optimising, professional users would not consider using one that lacked that facility. Like wise, I am interested to know if there is anyone that would consider a compiler that lacks support for TCO to be "Not Sufficiently Smart (tm)". I'm genuinely
[04:00:11] <neominimum> curious, not attempting to start an argument.
[04:02:46] *** Quits: morganw (~user@80.225.24.132) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:03:45] <jasom> first you need to define "what is tail position" (defun foo () (let ((*bar* 3)) (baz)) ; <-- the call to baz here will likely *not* be tail optimized on any CL compiler due to the dynamic binding of *bar*
[04:04:32] *** jdz_ is now known as jdz
[04:05:01] <jasom> Then once you've done that, you need to ensure that the function is compiled, as most interpreters will not eliminate the stack frame for tail calls
[04:06:02] <jasom> Then once you've done that, you need to ensure that the "optimize" declaration is set sufficiently high (in either the absolute or relative sense; some compilers may use the relative values of optimize v. debug, for example)
[04:06:27] <jasom> Or you could just use iteration
[04:08:01] <jasom> The one place I like to rely on TCO is when implementing state-machines; in that case the non-tail call approach is less readable IMO and will involve passing either closures or a list of function and arguments, both of which are more unweildy than a tail-call

[04:09:20] <jasom> I should also point out that non-tail-recursive code is *definitely* non-portable; the maximum recursion depth may vary not just from implementation to implementation, but from machine to machine even when using the same implementation

[04:16:10] <neominimum> Ok, so it's definitely not feasible in some situations due to environmental factors and the use of some language features.
[04:20:35] <neominimum> I do like recursion, more because I find it challenging. To me it definitely looks better than some iterative implementations sometimes, but as they say "When in Rome..."
[04:21:32] <jasom> Oh, there are times when recursion is more readable than iteration, but, in my experience, few of those cases are tail-recursive
[04:22:08] <jasom> The most obvious example is any sort of tree walker; the recursive form is almost trivial, the iterative form involves an explicit stack.
[04:22:54] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[04:24:26] <jasom> The naïve fibonacci is the most readable way to do fibonacci; I think the iterative vs. tail-recursive are of similar readability.
[04:26:06] <EdLangley[m]> Anything that's automactically TCOable can be manually TCOed with a TAGBODY
[04:26:10] <sm2n> for state machines, why not use tagbody?
[04:26:14] <sm2n> hah
[04:26:36] <EdLangley[m]> Clojure's LOOP/RECUR is an example of an abstraction that makes this a bit nicer.
[04:32:52] <jasom> sm2n: tagbody doesn't let you pass arguments
[04:33:34] <EdLangley[m]> If you (psetf arg1 (step arg1) arg2 (step2 arg2)) (go start) you can "pass arguments"
[04:33:40] <EdLangley[m]> This is just making TCO explicit
[04:33:57] *** Quits: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:34:40] <jasom> EdLangley[m]: right, but that's far less clear and sm2n was asking "why not use tagbody"
[04:34:53] <EdLangley[m]> Yeah, but you can solve this with a macro
[04:35:17] <EdLangley[m]> (defun-tco foo (arg1 arg2) ... (recur (step arg1) (step arg2)))
[04:35:19] <neominimum> If I understand correctly now. In the iterative form, walking a non-linear data structure, requires the use of an explicit stack. Compared to the recursive form utilising the implicit call stack.
[04:35:24] <jasom> also if you break in the middle of the state-machine, you more quickly get the information you want with most implementations it will show the current function
[04:36:08] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[04:36:50] <jasom> neominimum: right, my comment was that most of the times that recursion is more clear than iteration, it's due to the implicit call-stack, which means it's not a tail-call.
[04:37:18] <EdLangley[m]> Hmm, expanding to (defun foo (...) (macrolet ((foo () `(go start))) (tagbody start ...))) would mean you could just turn recursive calls into GOs

[04:37:41] <neominimum> jasom: I see, that's helpful
[04:38:20] <jasom> EdLangley[m]: at that point I'd rather just do a loop/apply/funcall and return a function/args list from each state
[04:38:54] <EdLangley[m]> I personally like the tagbody form
[04:39:19] <EdLangley[m]> I've used it in PHP before when the recursive version of a function was significantly easier to write than the iterative one.
[04:39:43] <jasom> I've done both and I find the tagbody gets unweidly quickly for complicated state machines
[04:40:22] <jasom> macros help a lot, but then can make debugging a bit more "exciting"

[12:28:56] <lisp123> Later on, I run a function that reads a file, and adds package qualifiers for all symbols not in the current-package or in CL
[12:29:14] <lisp123> Then I simply remove the starting USE PACKAGE
[12:30:40] <phoe> adds package qualifiers? as in, it reads a Lisp file and prints back out package-qualified symbols wherever applicable?

[12:36:51] <lisp123> beach: Yes. So I would manually remove the :USE option before reloading the files (including packages.lisp), although I'm sure there would be a way of finding the defpackage form then destructively modifying the file

[17:30:42] <mzan> neominimum: you said " In the iterative form, walking a non-linear data structure, requires the use of an explicit stack. Compared to the recursive form utilising the implicit call stack."
[17:31:44] <skeemer> people i was reading practical common lisp, and i was so excited about the higher order function trick that is being used here https://gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-a-simple-database.html
[17:32:16] <skeemer> more precisely this piece of code: https://bpa.st/OYXA
[17:32:27] <mzan> as beach already said, in practice a lot of nested data structures are trees or similar. In these cases you have often a not extremely deep hierarchy, so probably in these case you can write some recursive code, and use the iterative form only for the final leaf.
[17:32:40] <skeemer> i was wondering, are there other of these cool tricks with Higher order functions that can be used in more day-to-day applications?
[17:33:52] <phoe> skeemer: yes
[17:34:04] <phoe> this is a function that returns a closure
[17:34:20] <phoe> and these are very commonly used, e.g. in CL-PPCRE
[17:34:40] <yitzi> skeemer: Its a natural part of CL. Examples are closure construction are all over.
[17:35:11] <skeemer> phoe, i understand the coolness, but probably i cannot come up with other examples where i could use such things...
[17:35:17] <skeemer> can somebody make me other practical examples?
[17:35:35] <skeemer> or how can i practice this? are there any programming exercises online for me to train this ability to code like that?

[17:36:22] <mzan> neominimum: for example I wrote a rather classical code-formatting function. It accepts as parameter the indentation level, and for each nested scope, it calls itself increasing its parameter. It i recursive. But how many nested scope are there usually? Less than thousands. Then for the instructions inside the current scope, I use a normal iterative loop.
[17:37:07] <mzan> So in many cases you can combine recursion with explicit iterative loops. You use recursion for the hierarchy part, and recursion for the leaf/final-data.
[17:37:28] <skeemer> mzan, why should one use iteration for the final leaf?
[17:37:35] <skeemer> and not again recursion?

[17:38:01] *** Joins: mon_aaraj (~MonAaraj@user/mon-aaraj/x-4416475)
[17:38:24] <mzan> skeemer: because CL does not support in the standard tail-call optimization, so recursion of potentially many data can overflow the stack
[17:39:11] <skeemer> okok
[17:40:37] <Xach> skeemer: i have been very happy with a query system based on simple functions that return object matchers, and then a few logical glue functions that compose simpler functions into arbitrary expressions.
[17:41:10] <Xach> i'm working with a system that produces thousands of sets of change records for certain objects, and i want to select only certain objects of interest interactively at the REPL
[17:42:16] <Xach> so i can write something like (=and (=matches-text "Foo") (=score> 100) (=not (=color "purple")))) -- here the "=" prefix indicates a function that returns a function.

[17:43:53] <skeemer> Xach, are there other tricks for closures? i mean other cool uses like this one?

[18:09:47] <phoe> in particular, CL docstring formatting is Wild West
[18:11:53] <_73> I started using it cause emacs highlights it for me so I figured it was a thing in CL. But then I couldn't find anyone elses code out there using it.

[18:12:35] <lisp123> ah
[18:12:48] <_death> the elisp reader is case preserving, so `bar' is often used, while CL's reader is upcasing by default so we just say BAR.. some elisp code uses the latter and some CL code uses the former as well

I don't see it mentioned in (elisp) Function Documentation, but I notice that it works in practice, i.e. a phrase such as `ssh' get highlighted and is a clickable link to the  documentation of the function ssh.

[23:04:32] <edgar-rft> hmm, from where do I get a literate that I can program?
[23:07:25] <White_Flame> isn't literate programming usually about being documentation with code interspersed?

[23:10:07] <phoe> White_Flame: I think it is - I kind of abuse this idea to also include stuff that teaches writing Lisp in general

[23:21:23] <moon-child> phoe: 'we did not supply the second argument to LOAD-TIME-VALUE, which creates constant data'  I think this would be clearer as 'we did not supply a second argument to LOAD-TIME-VALUE, which lets us create constant data'
