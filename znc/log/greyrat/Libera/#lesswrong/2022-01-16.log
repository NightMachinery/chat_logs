[00:52:58] * adiabatic double-clicks on the ‚àí‚Éù button
[00:52:59] <gwern> anyway this is something that is very important for LW types to know, particularly once the plague began
[00:53:15] <gwern> just because all techies should know that wifi is crack and aids especially for videoconferencing
[00:53:18] <gwern> it is a public service
[00:53:26] <kuudes> oh yes, videocalls
[00:53:39] <gwern> because their self-sabotaging use of wifi hurts the rest of us on those calls too
[00:54:08] <kuudes> and most of the videocall systems also have a topography that is something else than client-server
[00:54:51] <kuudes> hmm.. does google still offer stadia? that would be perfect for current videocall systems

[01:03:01] <gwern> the problem there is that broadcast communications is basically worthless
[01:03:29] <kuudes> all the world's air is 1 wire.
[01:03:34] <kuudes> basicly that is the problem
[01:03:50] <gwern> what do you actually need to send worldwide over radio right this second? an atomic clock signal, sure, a few emergency messages, what else? your local latino jazz ensemble's weekly podcast review?

[01:04:48] <kuudes> however much bandwidth our given tech level can give the world total over air it can give to each wire, and there can be much more wires than there can be airs on world
[01:05:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And in case you're not upset yet, there's this angle: If half the world's problems are caused by having too many people, the other half are caused by all of us wanting to move around so much‚Äîfrom home to work, from work to our customer's work, from our picturesque hometowns to identical airports, hotels, and tourist traps around the world.

[01:12:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Did you see my comment before
[01:17:31] <quanticle> re: "It is an ecologically unsound waste of energy to broadcast bits in all directions when they need to be received in only one" <-- I guess this person has never heard of "beamforming"
[01:17:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean
[01:17:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was 1993
[01:17:47] <quanticle> Beamforming was around in '93
[01:17:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yes I also thought of beamforming when I read that
[01:17:56] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: about fonts1? yeah i'll try it in a bit
[01:18:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: k
[01:18:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Uh, maybe it was, but who was using it for consumer-grade wireless networking?
[01:18:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or even enterprise-grade wireless networking
[01:18:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> And was there even any such thing as either of those things, at all
[01:19:41] <quanticle> Oh, there was not, but I thought this was in the context of like, cell phones
[01:19:49] <quanticle> Which were barely consumer grade at that point
[01:20:05] <saturn2> "There‚Äôs no way for your router or device to notify you if it‚Äôs experiencing interference" this is only true for bad routers and devices
[01:21:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Well, as Metcalfe correctly points out, cell phone data rates aren't exactly adequate for general-purpose-computer use
[01:21:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is just as true today as it was in '93
[01:22:40] <gwern> I doubt that. I bet if you could dig up rates for those '93 cellular data rates and did it as a ratio of normal use of a 56k dialup or something, you'd find that the ratio is far more dire than today's cellular data vs broadband
[01:22:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Also it seems like even for cell phones it might've come later than you said: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming#History_in_wireless_communication_standards
[01:22:41] <Robomot> Beamforming - Wikipedia [History in wireless communication standards] (Beamforming techniques used in cellular phone standards have advanced through the generations to make use of more complex systems to achieve higher density cells, with higher throughput.)
[01:23:26] <gwern> (people these days don't think much of tethering with their phone as a hotspot and streaming. back then, even a rich techie would spend a while thinking and reach into their bag for the lube before starting such a thing)
[01:23:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Metcalfe gives the example of 19.2Kbps cellular data rate, which compares quite favorably to dialup of the time
[01:23:37] <gwern> yes, but at what cost?
[01:23:41] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[01:24:05] <gwern> since it's 1993, I wouldn't be shocked if it turned out to be 'wtf are you kidding me' prices like 1000 USD2002
[01:24:09] <gwern> * 2022
[01:24:18] <quanticle> Yeah, early cell phones were broadcast. I don't think beamforming really became a thing until 3G, or maybe even LTE. But, the point stands, the ether *is* too valuable for us to spray bits in every direction, when they only need to go in one direction. That's why we worked so hard to figure out ways to not do that any more than we had to.
[01:24:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> What are today's cell data rates?
[01:25:06] <gwern> being super lazy and googling to get https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-unlimited-data-plans/ it looks like it's on the order of $100

[01:25:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean how much bandwidth do you get
[01:26:13] <gwern> they offer some form of 5G, so... hm...
[01:26:41] <gwern> maybe 50mbps? which is pretty much my cable modem speed lol
[01:27:15] <PlanckWalk> That's about the minimum
[01:27:22] <PlanckWalk> It can go about 100x that in principle
[01:27:37] <gwern> PlanckWalk: yes, in principle, but you know that american telecoms are all about the lies, so even the minimum might be optimistic
[01:28:15] <kuudes> I should call my telco because I think I only get 400 Mbps but pay for 1000
[01:28:23] <PlanckWalk> Oh, in practice it will be how oversubscribed they are.
[01:28:24] <quanticle> I get roughly 20-30 Mbps off my phone, with Google Fi's 5G running on T-Mobile's physical infrastructure. It's nowhere near the speed of my cable modem, but it's perfectly fine for general Internet stuff that doesn't involve video. Latency isn't too bad either. I can even run normal SSH over it.
[01:28:29] <gwern> PlanckWalk: like I said - lies
[01:28:37] <quanticle> Whereas before, I'd have to use mosh
[01:28:41] <PlanckWalk> It won't even really depend upon the technology
[01:28:44] <kuudes> but as there is omicron, I don't want to get anyone to come fix it to my home
[01:29:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, the ratio is worse today
[01:29:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Clearly
[01:29:29] <quanticle> kuudes with the lowkey flex, "My internet connection in a *degraded state* is faster than most of yours working nominally"
[01:29:48] <saturn2> i remember when WAP cost the same as text messages. so 10 cents per 16
[01:29:53] <saturn2> 0 bytes
[01:30:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like you can get gigabit FIOS
[01:31:00] <gwern> so the dialup is 3x faster than the cited 1993 cellphone, while we seem to be around rough parity of home cable vs 5g smartphone. the 5G plans cost similar to home costs, so that's already an advantage for the present day. which leaves just the '93 real cost of using a phone like a dialup, which would be hard to find out but given how SMS went, I really do expect to be easily $1000+/month in...
[01:31:06] <gwern> ...2022 dollars
[01:31:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Parity?! Are you kidding?
[01:31:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Home cable is much faster than ... did you say 50Mbps?
[01:31:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's low-end! Very!
[01:31:52] <quanticle> Yeah, my home cable is ~250Mbps
[01:31:54] * gwern is owned by having a low-end cable modem ;_;
[01:32:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even I get 230Mbps, and that's only because I'm far from the CO and my landlord refuses to allow FIOS
[01:32:16] <saturn2> that would be 655 dollars per megabyte
[01:32:26] <quanticle> And that's not even getting into stuff like FiOS or Google Fiber which gives you gigabit fiber to the premises.
[01:32:43] <kuudes> saturn2, imagine what sort of NFT you would have for that price
[01:32:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> My friends all have 500Mbps at least, and some have that gigabit FIOS I mentioned
[01:33:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is anywhere from 4.5x to 20x of 5G
[01:33:41] <PlanckWalk> I get 50 Mb/s on 4G.  I could get 1 Gb/s on the land line but don't want to pay that much.
[01:34:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's to say nothing of latency
[01:34:30] <quanticle> Latency on cell phones has improved far more than raw throughput
[01:34:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's phone latency like these days? Like how high a ping
[01:34:47] <PlanckWalk> 24 ms latency on 4G
[01:34:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok that's impressive
[01:34:57] <PlanckWalk> Just did a speed test
[01:34:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Didn't expect that from a phone
[01:35:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that consistent?
[01:35:06] <PlanckWalk> I don't know
[01:35:18] <PlanckWalk> Oh hahahaha
[01:35:24] * PlanckWalk turns of Wifi on the phone
[01:35:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... lol
[01:35:35] <quanticle> I remember *good* cell signals having 300-400ms latency. Today, a good cell signal will have 50-60ms. Like I said above, using mosh was pretty much *mandatory* if you wanted a usable typing experience for SSH. No longer. A good 5G connection can handle SSH just fine.
[01:35:38] <PlanckWalk> It wasn't 4G at all!
[01:35:47] <quanticle> Better than crappy wi-fi, in a lot of instances.
[01:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: So what is it actually
[01:36:04] <PlanckWalk> Running new test...
[01:36:32] <PlanckWalk> 9 Mb/s on 4G, 35 ms ping
[01:37:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still not terrible latency-wise
[01:37:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I still wonder how consistent that is
[01:37:52] <quanticle> Not as good here; I just did a latency test and it was jumping around between 80 and 100ms
[01:38:04] <quanticle> Still, acceptable for most things, though.
[01:38:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> In my WoW raid we have a couple guys who often play via a tethered connection, and it's noticeably bad - can't give them critical (very reaction-time-dependent) assignments when they do that
[01:38:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> *raids
[01:39:06] <quanticle> Yeah, if you're really looking for twitch-level performance, you'll want <50ms latency which is really hard to get with a phone.
[01:39:30] <quanticle> But for SSH and IRC that latency is totally fine.
[01:39:38] <PlanckWalk> Especially if using tethered which adds wifi latency to phone latency
[01:39:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Not if you always want to be the first to the punchline...
[01:39:59] <quanticle> Haha
[01:40:10] <kuudes> 5g should have good latency, for some values of good
[01:40:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Can't you tether by wire?
[01:40:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or is that not a thing nowadays
[01:40:20] <PlanckWalk> In principle maybe
[01:40:37] <quanticle> I've seen an option for it in Android, but I've never used it
[01:40:49] <kuudes> thats another thing we lost
[01:41:12] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, there's an option here
[01:41:29] <kuudes> meh. I guess it is now rolling 20 years from various achievements of 00s, so they come free of patents and google and apple finally implement them
[01:42:00] <kuudes> soon we might get native video calls
[01:42:28] <PlanckWalk> That's crazy talk
[01:43:00] <kuudes> I wonder if they still implement that on base stations? it was in the standard in 3g already

[01:54:20] <ggreer> learning cad is so frustrating. I have an exact picture of what I want in my mind, but it takes hours to get a 3d model
[01:54:37] * Obormot\Arcturus thinks fondly of CADKEY
[01:55:56] <ggreer> maybe it's because I'm building a fully integrated shell and not a bunch of little parts that fit together, but it really feels like I'm fighting the software the whole time. if I could write a program that generated the solid, I'd probably be able to do this in a tenth of the time
[01:56:20] <ggreer> eg: create a picatinny rail section with hole for m2.5 hex, then tile that along the y axis for 80mm
[01:56:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Can you not model it in Blender or something and then export to a CAD format?
[01:57:43] <ggreer> maybe, but I already got the sections I wanted and now I want to repeat them, subtract them, etc.
[01:57:56] <ggreer> the sketch constraints in cad are really handy though
[01:59:23] <ggreer> also fun: building a single piece is much harder than building little pieces, printing them, and then assembling them. with little pieces you can choose the best print axis for each. with a single piece you have to be careful because some shapes won't print no matter how much support you give them (or you give them so much support that they're basically a solid that you have to cut)

[02:17:38] <gwern> 'Shot shells have also been historically issued to soldiers, to be used in standard issue rifles. The .45-70 "forager" round, which contained a thin wooden bullet filled with birdshot, was intended for hunting small game to supplement the soldiers' rations.[2][3] This round in effect made the .45-70 rifle into a small gauge shotgun, capable of killing rabbits, ducks, and other small game.'...

Snake shot is generally used for shooting snakes, rodents, birds, and other pests at very close range. The most common snake shot cartridge is .22 Long Rifle loaded with No. 12 shot. From a standard rifle these can produce effective patterns only to a distance ‚Ä¶)

[02:18:23] <dTal> caveats, it doesn't output BRep files (STEP), only meshes (STL), and it doesn't have any kind of a constraints engine - but you can enforce your own constraints mathematically if you have reasonable geometry skills
[02:18:25] <quanticle> You know how we often say, "The opposite of good advice is also often good advice?" Well, I guess that applies to programming too: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20041220-00/?p=36943
[02:18:27] <quanticle> Good advice: Never recompute anything you can easily cache
[02:18:27] <Robomot> Don't save anything you can recalculate - The Old New Thing (Nowadays, a major barrier to performance for many classes of programs is paging. We saw earlier this year that paging can kill a server. Today, another example of how performance became tied to paging. The principle is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt save anything you can recalculate.‚Äù)
[02:18:29] <quanticle> Also good advice: Never cache anything you can easily recompute
[02:19:31] <two2thehead> "We were interested to find that the report of the shotgun was about normal, but the recoil was almost nonexistent. None."
[02:20:53] <saturn2> always compare the available ram to cpu speed and apply a cost/benefit analysis
[02:21:57] <quanticle> "Whether this technique works for you is hard to predict. If your program is processor-bound, then caching computations is probably a good idea. But if your program is memory-bound, then you may be better off getting rid of the cache, since the cache is just creating more memory pressure."
[02:21:59] <quanticle> The key elided point there is that many programmers who think they're CPU bound are actually memory bound, and thus when they add caching, they're just making their lives worse.
[02:22:35] <feep> also, an underappreciated technique is finding ways to reduce the amount of data you are operating on at once

[02:39:27] <Robomot> Paul Graham (@paulg): "9 yo asked for a Wii for Christmas. It's surprising how lame the graphics seem; 2006 wasn't that long ago. But he loves playing these games anyway. The fun of playing a game doesn't scale anything like linearly with computing power."
[02:40:00] <kuudes> wii had low graphics because it was still made for a tv
[02:40:03] <quanticle> Yep, that's why Nintendo makes so much money
[02:41:25] <quanticle> All Nintendo consoles have been relatively low-powered, going back at least to the N64. The last time that Nintendo had a console with as much compute as the competition was the SNES (and even that was arguable, if you listen to the Sega Genesis fanboys).
[02:41:51] <saturn2> wii graphics looked primitive even at the time, compared to other consoles
[02:42:19] <catern> "I've lost my X, could you return it to me?" what's a single word to replace "return" there? I could say "bring back" but that's two words (this is for a method name)
[02:42:28] <quanticle> Yep. The Wii is a peer to the PS3 and XBox 360 and both of those have far more modern looking graphics.
[02:42:41] <gwern> (hm. this magic site can't be that professional otherwise they'd have download automated, instead of telling you to wait 12 hours - which implies there's someone on the backend manually approving things. it's 7AM in shenzhen/beijing/shanghai now, so unsurprisingly, no response yet)
[02:42:50] <saturn2> it was a good way to signal that they wanted to focus on actually making the games fun, imo
[02:44:22] <quanticle> I guess, but were Wii games actually more fun? I think Nintendo's reach exceeded its grasp with the controller. The tech just wasn't there yet to allow motion controls to be useful as a means of interaction
[02:44:57] <quanticle> I like the Wii, but to me it's really more of a Gamecube++
[02:47:46] <kuudes> it had the potential to become the "home computer"

[02:49:23] <kuudes> the pointing remote was actually quite natural way of ui
[02:49:42] <kuudes> tvs should have that in general
[02:50:10] <kuudes> I mean, things like spotify would seem a good fit to wii imo
[02:52:38] <gwern> nintendo has never played well with others
[02:52:57] <gwern> and that's a problem because the world outgrew nintendo a long long time ago
[02:53:30] <gwern> look at how ginormous apple has had to become in order to do even a small fraction in house of what it would like to do in house
[02:54:30] <PlanckWalk> catern: Slightly reword to "retrieve it for me"?
[02:54:41] <gwern> this is why you see nintendo probing things like 'the Famicom as home computer' or 'the Famicom as knitting machine' or 'download games to your SNES over satellites' but never is able to push things through to completion. Nintendo had simple online gaming before the dreamcast or xbox. yet it lagged infinitely behind
[02:55:04] <gwern> it has the scale to do pilot prototypes, but then can't or won't scale it
[02:55:52] <catern> PlanckWalk: hm, thanks for the suggestion but I want the verb to work as a method name on the person-object requesting this (Person.return(item) works for this, and Person.bring_back(item) is only slightly worse, but Person.retrieve(item) doesn't really scan I think)
[02:56:00] <gwern> this was always a trend in gaming and computing... the slowly rising tide of scales and expectations which mean that you go from 1 man shops doing the design / artwork / programming / sales / support from their apartment to things like Apple
[02:56:13] <gwern> it's just less obvious with Nintendo because we think of them as 'big'

[03:28:01] <quanticle> They won't be measuring what they're thinking they're measuring and what they think they're measuring is, at best, only loosely associated with what they actually care about.

[03:34:34] <Betawolf> quanticle: Sounds fair enough. Self-report is an issue, especially for figures, but at least you've done the first thing and actually asked people what they think.
[03:34:34] <quanticle> Oh wait, no, I got it backwards. They set up a hypothetical restaurant and asked people how much they'd tip a waiter who was black, Latino, Asian, etc.

[03:34:54] <quanticle> So, it's even worse than my initial even worse impression.
[03:35:12] <Betawolf> Thought experiments are, uh, less good. 
[03:35:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Hm actually wait though, what is the font server proxy hostname for that? Like instead of fonts.greaterwrong.com it's what
[03:35:32] <Robomot> 403 forbidden | http://fonts.greaterwrong.com/
[03:36:16] <quanticle> This is the standard thing that economists bag on sociologists about all the time: you put people into this artificial lab setting, completely divorced from their real world experience, and you ask them how much they would tip in a particular scenario, and you pretend that this has anything at all to do with how much they *do* tip when they're actually out with their friends or w/e
[03:36:51] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: i turned off the proxy for this test
[03:37:24] <Betawolf> Yeah, asking actual staff how much they make in tips would be much better than that.
[03:37:32] <saturn2> i suppose i should set up a test proxy
[03:38:01] <quanticle> "In sum, this within- and between-subjects survey experiment produced no evidence that Black servers are on average tipped less than White servers."
[03:38:02] <quanticle> Well, of course it didn't! What you just did was the functional equivalent of passing out a survey, asking, "Are you racist: y / n"
[03:38:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Oh so what is the referer of the font file requests then...? You're using fonts.obormot directly?
[03:38:32] <Betawolf> I'm amazed it didn't find a bias in favour of blacks, if they recruited on a campus.
[03:38:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Sorry, I should've asked first, heh: 403 forbidden on what specifically? CSS file request? Or font file requests?
[03:39:00] <saturn2> font files
[03:39:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok yeah so then my previous q
[03:39:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Referer is what

[03:39:50] <Robomot> LessWrong Proving Ground (LessWrong 2.0 viewer test site.)
[03:39:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... of the font file requests?
[03:40:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> That can't be right
[03:40:09] <quanticle> But okay, this is a meta-analysis. Maybe the next survey is better?
[03:40:11] <quanticle> "Participants for this study were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk."
[03:40:13] <quanticle> Narrator: "It was not better"
[03:40:49] <Betawolf> people on AMT are really good at filling out surveys quickly, and some of them even read the questions.
[03:41:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: You're either requesting base64 encoded fonts which come in the .css and then there is no font file to request, or you're requesting without base64 encoding in which case the referer should be the origin of the .css file (which is the font server, or the proxy if there is one)
[03:41:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: So something's weird somewhere
[03:42:12] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: oh... yeah i forgot, i made the server download the CSS and serve it directly, which lets rendering start before the font server responds
[03:42:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright
[03:42:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean that's cool but how does it work on live?
[03:42:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> You should be getting the same 403s there, then...
[03:43:40] <quanticle> "Specifically, respondents were asked to read a hypothetical dining vignette wherein the server‚Äôs race (Black/White), server‚Äôs gender (male/female), and service quality (excellent/average/poor) were manipulated. One of the 12 conditions was randomly displayed to each of our participants."
[03:43:42] <quanticle> Ah, so instead of conducting your survey via a telephone polling firm, you... conducted exactly the same survey, but on a computer and with Mechanical Turk participants. This is truly excellent reseach methodology, amazing statistical power, and will results in absolutely unimpeachable, ironclad results, I'm sure.

[03:44:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm ok well let me add the test server to the permissions for now I guess
[03:44:54] <two2thehead> hm
[03:45:12] <two2thehead> could be
[03:45:13] <Betawolf> For studying a topic like this I'd expect (a) asking a lot of actual staff how much they get in tips and seeing if that differs by race; (b) running a bunch of studies where your multiracial psych students work in coffee shops (incidentally valuable work experience for them) and measuring what they actually get instead of hazy staff impressions and (c) dicking around with the exposure on (b) to be 
[03:45:19] <Betawolf> sure it was race causing any effect you found.
[03:45:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: ok go
[03:47:57] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: ok now the regular fonts work, but the base64 ones say "downloadable font: rejected by sanitizer"

[03:50:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well
[03:50:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's weird. :\
[03:50:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll test it some more later I guess
[03:50:38] <quanticle> "At the very end of the survey, we also asked respondents to reflect back to the hypothetical dining scenario that they had read earlier and indicate, 'if they had to guess,' whether their server was likely a 'White male,' 'Black male,' 'White female,'‚ÄúBlack female,' Hispanic male,' or a 'Hispanic female.' Seventy-seven percent (n = 1,043) of our participants correctly 'guessed' the race and
[03:50:40] <quanticle> gender of the server depicted in the vignette thus indicating that our manipulation of servers‚Äô race and gender was successful."
[03:50:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fucking browsers man
[03:50:42] <quanticle> But isn't that the opposite of what you want? Like, the question you're interested in is whether the unconscious bias of people tipping affects how much they tip, yes? So your way of answering that question is to make people super-ultra aware of the race of the person they're (hypothetically) tipping?

[09:30:43] <ggreer> most of the inaccuracy comes from printing support structures and then breaking them off. if I sanded those bits, it'd look pretty decent
[09:31:22] <ggreer> also that's printed at 0.2mm layers. I could double accuracy by printing 0.1mm layers but that'd double print time
[09:32:29] <quanticle> Yeah, that's pretty good precision. Dang, I'm really thinking about getting a 3D printer.

[09:37:02] <quanticle> Then probably a toothbrush holder or something. I have one, from Target, but I made the mistake of getting one in stainless steel, and it's looking kind of meh with the hard water stains. And then, I dunno, probably some copyrighted stuff like Pok√©mon figures or something.
[09:37:42] <quanticle> Do you need any special equipment to level the bed, or is like... a bubble level fine?
[09:38:25] <quanticle> And do you need to have it up on a table, or can you put it on the floor?
[09:39:01] <ggreer> the printer itself doesn't have to be level, but the print bed in the printer must be perfectly level with the print head
[09:39:28] <quanticle> Right, so what do you need to do to ensure that?

[09:48:08] <quanticle> I'm looking at this post about PETG filament (https://medium.com/@ZMorph/petg-vs-pla-filaments-comparison-dfa813403ea2) and it says, "Printing space: closed"

[11:47:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Solar, wind, and geothermal progress has been impeded by regulations that benefit the fossil-fuel industry, by antigrowth attitudes among Americans who don‚Äôt want new energy projects in their neighborhood, and by questionable cost-benefit analyses by environmentalists."
[11:50:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> So... there are Americans who have antigrowth attitudes, don't want new energy projects in their neighborhoods (and are evidently influential enough electorally that their opinions matter), and also the fossil-fuel industry can evidently get regulations put in place that they want. And obviously *you*, Mr. Well-Intentioned Reformer, are *not* influential enough to get any regulations made or your attitudes catered to. Given
[11:50:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  that, what the hell are we even talking about with "this is what 'we' need to do"?
[11:50:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I also am annoyed by this sort of thing:
[11:53:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "(To pick one example: The proposal to build the biggest solar plant in the U.S. hit a snag when environmentalist groups objected to the possible impact on Nevada‚Äôs desert-tortoise population.)" - right, ok, but having picked that example, is not the obvious next question: "and *would* the desert tortoises in fact be impacted by the solar plant?" If the answer is "yes", well, clearly there are people who don't want your
[11:53:40] <Obormot\Arcturus>  solar plant to be built. If the answer is "we don't know", well, I guess "we" better find out, right? (Unless you think we don't need to care? But the environmentalists disagree!) If the answer is "no", then that's the actual objection, presumably - but then you're back to being mired in impact analyses, because how else are you gonna know if the tortoises will be impacted or not
[11:54:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The one thing that you can't do is just say "ugh, those environmentalists with their impact analyses, that's the problem" - as if there aren't *actual people* who are *putting in actual effort* to stop the things that you say are unambiguously good
[11:55:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Similarly: "oh we need to remove the artificial scarcity of doctors" - yeah? Who's "we", pal? Not the currently practicing doctors! They don't need shit
[11:56:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Oh we need to get more people into elite colleges, by making admissions more competitive and expanding enrollment" - get outta town! The elite colleges sure as shit don't want that, and *the opinion that matters is theirs, and NOT yours*
[11:58:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, unrelatedly to all of that:
[11:59:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "An abundance agenda needs a target. What should we make more of? One answer that I‚Äôve given you is: essential goods and services where productivity rates are declining. But that‚Äôs a bit fusty and technical. Let me try to offer a simpler answer.

[11:59:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "aim for abundance of comfort, abundance of power, and abundance of time"?? It's like you're *asking* to get your entire memeplex summarily dismissed as "rich white assholes crying about not being rich enough"

[22:28:16] <Robomot> 404 not found
[22:31:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Heh ... :\
[22:32:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I remember first observing this effect in, of all things, TTRPG design
[22:34:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> People on D&D forums, like the official WotC forum and others, would post homebrew content for others to critique... these were places where old gaming veterans hung out, some game designers too (even Gygax used to post on ENWorld and other web forums), so good places to get feedback...
[22:35:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> And what I'd see is that the amount of praise was *obviously* correlated more strongly with overall typographic and stylistic polish, etc., than with anything else
[22:38:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> There was this one dude who always put in a lot of effort into making his posts where he posted his character classes and such that he designed look professional - layout, styling, consistent and harmonious typographic element usage... all the stuff we do (applied within the constraints of a web forum, of course, but still effort in this regard goes a long way!)
[22:38:34] <gwern> playtesting is hard work, let's go pinterest shopping
[22:38:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Invariably he would get gushing feedback even when his actual designed game mechanics were the dumbest shit
[22:39:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Later it was revealed, to the surprised of absolutely no one except dummies, that he had a standard post template he used, so all that work was done once)
[22:39:59] <gwern> (just because his game mechanics were dumb didn't mean his design workflow had to be dumb, I guess. hard to be good at everything, and visual design was apparently his thing)
[22:40:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[22:41:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Paizo does the same thing (except they make good money from it). Pathfinder/Starfinder sourcebooks have incredible production values, they hire top-notch artists, their typography is A++, page decorations we can only dream of
[22:41:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> People go "ooh wow"
[22:42:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then you read the actual game content and mechanically so much of it is the blandest and most uninspired pablum
[22:45:54] <saturn2> guided by the beauty of our graphics
[22:46:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The real "oh no" here is when you tie this "fooled by beautiful data" result back to that paper I linked at some point about how the designers of these sorts of visualizations invariably start with the design of the data graphic and only later look at the data to figure out how to fit it into the graphic (and do not alter the visualization to reflect the data's properties, but rather fit the data into the designed
[22:46:44] <Obormot\Arcturus>  graphic)
[22:46:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yes, literally what saturn2 said
