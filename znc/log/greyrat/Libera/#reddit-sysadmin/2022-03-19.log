[01:33:00] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Yeah, exactly. Instead of finding a better solution or escalating it to the Senior Team they would either use the registry "fix" or bypass the print server and add the printer by IP locally...

[09:15:57] <sideup66> ksmbd
[09:16:01] <sideup66> can someone explain why that exists
[09:17:12] <CableNinja> isnt that the KDE samba UI?
[09:17:15] <sideup66> no
[09:17:20] <sideup66> its the kernel layer samba
[09:17:23] <CableNinja> :o
[09:17:26] <CableNinja> really
[09:17:28] <sideup66> why does file share need the fscking kernel
[09:17:45] <sideup66> and people wonder why they get had....ugh
[09:18:40] <Reinhilde> is ksmbd a linux component or solaris?
[09:19:21] <CableNinja> its a kernelspace implementation that aims for performance it looks like
[09:19:30] <CableNinja> but its still not a total replacement for smbd
[09:19:39] <CableNinja> ksmbd does not:
[09:19:40] <CableNinja> Running as a Active Directory domain member
[09:19:40] <CableNinja> Scale-out clustering
[09:19:40] <CableNinja> Optimize for specific filesystems like GlusterFS or Ceph via dedicated VFS modules
[09:19:40] <CableNinja> Shadow Copy support
[09:20:19] <CableNinja> its also not even that performant lol

[09:20:56] <Hunterkll> sideup66: performance
[09:21:21] <Hunterkll> same reason shit like IIS runs in kernel (and smokes apache and even nginx for speed)
[09:21:48] <Hunterkll> there's in kernel HTTP servers for almost every OS lol
[09:21:57] <CableNinja> Hunterkll, its not even performant comparable to samba
[09:22:27] <Hunterkll> *shrug* well, that's the idea
[09:22:30] <Hunterkll> i suppose
[09:22:36] <Hunterkll> but i like the reasoning there tho
[09:22:39] <Hunterkll> for things like wrt etc 
[09:22:46] <CableNinja> yeah thats what their claim is but the performance benchmarks seem to say otherwise
[09:23:02] <Hunterkll> i mean, IIS is easy to test and benchmark, so :P
[09:23:10] <Hunterkll> we use IIS as caching proxy servers in front of apache based web apps
[09:23:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:23:17] <CableNinja> I'm talkin about the ksmbd
[09:23:20] <Hunterkll> yea i know
[09:23:38] <Hunterkll> but also given how new it is
[09:23:46] <Hunterkll> and i bet they're still running into context negotiation issues
[09:23:46] <Hunterkll> etc
[09:24:25] <Hunterkll> huh
[09:24:31] <Hunterkll> already working on smb direct support apparently
[09:24:37] <Hunterkll> now that'll scream some performance
[09:24:43] <Hunterkll> code isn't too bad here....
[09:24:58] <Hunterkll>  * This is nothing but a HACK. Session status should move to channel
[09:25:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:25:04] <CableNinja> yeah I'm gonna mention it to our platform team on monday see if they think it might make a better solution
[09:25:07] <Hunterkll> i take back that code isn't too bad 
[09:30:43] <CableNinja> motherfuuuuuck my knees killlin me

[10:32:01] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> Interesting, another thing to deep dive into
[10:32:09] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> Thanks Hunterkill, that's very cool 🙂
[10:32:54] <Hunterkll> highly reccomend a read of the windows internals books like they say in that article too
[10:33:09] <Hunterkll> and oddly enough, understanding OpenVMS 
[10:33:12] <Hunterkll> will help you 
[10:33:24] <Hunterkll> NT was an attempt by VMS's creator to do VMS better
[10:33:34] <Hunterkll> in some ways, it was a wild success, especially with clustering/failover tech
[10:33:56] <Hunterkll> then they gave it to end users and made them default admin for consumer machines and threw away all that success :P
[10:35:29] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> yeah so i disabled hardware acceleration in discord and my colours are back
[10:35:43] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> blue was violet and everything was desaturated, same with chrome
[10:37:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:37:15] <Hunterkll> turning off gpu acceleration of app rendering sometimes has ..... interesteing effects 
[10:37:19] <Hunterkll> because so much relies on it now
[10:37:51] <Hunterkll> especially with parts of explorer and whatnot being ported away from Win32 to WinRT APIs and becoming 'more native' / integrated
[10:38:12] <Hunterkll> we're looking at a vGPU solutino for our VDI with low end GPUs just to cut down on CPU load 
[10:38:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:39:06] <Hunterkll> @sunflowers also, only look at WDM/WDDM for driver frameworks/working
[10:39:13] <Hunterkll> don't use NTDM/XPDM
[10:39:19] <Hunterkll> they still work but they're ancient 
[10:39:41] <Hunterkll> and they are purely kernel mode only, not user space, so can crash/tank systems instead of restarting gracefully
[10:39:54] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> interesting, makes sense from waht I know of 2k/nt and then the XP push after 9x/ME failure
[10:40:33] <Hunterkll> 9x/ME wasn't a failure
[10:40:35] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> makes more sense, didn't know about that difference but NT/XP yes
[10:40:37] <Hunterkll> it was just the end of it's line tech wise
[10:40:46] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> no, but the end of ME and drivers being reused from 98
[10:40:59] <Hunterkll> ME actually was the first to introduce the newer driver models
[10:41:07] <Hunterkll> there was a lot of tech/innovation in that bundle that people didn't realize
[10:41:14] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> yes, but the 3rd party vendor supports
[10:41:23] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:41:36] <Hunterkll> what was it, nVidia was the reason for like 70% of BSODs on XP 
[10:41:51] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> was it? I thought nvidia was releatively stable but back then
[10:41:55] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> I had a geforce 5200 pci lol
[10:42:02] <Hunterkll> ah okay, WDM started with 98 and win2k

[10:42:04] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> I'm doing DDU and reinstall of geforce drivers
[10:42:24] <Hunterkll> @sunflowers it was NTDM style drivers being used on XP instead of WDM drivers that caused a ton of issues
[10:42:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:42:47] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> curious I never ran into issues with nvidia back then except pci was shit
[10:42:49] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> I thought I was seeing things when the PayPal page was violet instead of blue
[10:43:05] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> but could run age of empires and project 64 so I was satitated
[10:43:19] <Hunterkll> ah no
[10:43:22] <Hunterkll> it was NTDM style drivers in vista
[10:43:28] <Hunterkll> and specifically, GPU ones
[10:43:34] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Geforce driver 511.79 if anyone else has the same issue
[10:43:35] <Hunterkll> that accounted for about 70% of Vista's BSODs in the field
[10:43:40] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> yeah, that makes sense with aero theme and tryign to get max performance from what I red about NTDM
[10:43:53] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> XP was relatively stable but longhorn/vista was a big push to make it pretty/aero
[10:43:57] <Hunterkll> NTDM is *ancient*
[10:44:02] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Also fixed discord looking colourblind
[10:44:11] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> I'm using DCH drivers btw
[10:44:30] <Hunterkll> DCH is just a packaging format really
[10:44:40] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> I know 100% for sure alot of WinME issues was poor support from OEMs and re-using drivers for 9x, and then for Vista, bit the same as was the drive to Windows XP x64/longhorn
[10:44:48] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> err  XP X64/vista
[10:44:58] <Hunterkll> well, ME is 9x based
[10:44:58] <sd> 09<s​unflowers> back in the day there were 0 drivers if you installed x64
[10:44:59] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Also dos and not nt kernel
[10:45:04] <Hunterkll> so drivers (WDM ones) from 98 work just fine

[23:47:15] <riff-W2K> @critamine: looks good on my CRT monitor (Gateway EV700B connected to my Athlon 64 system, brought to you by Windows 2000 USP5.1)
[23:47:35] <bomb> riff-W2K for real?
[23:53:30] <riff-W2K> yea
[23:54:26] <bomb> that's cool. I hope it's not still in production, powering a nuclear missile system or something
[23:54:43] <bomb> but I heard they're mostly upgraded to Windows XP by now :)
[23:54:44] <riff-W2K> https://ibb.co/55XxZRd
[23:55:08] <riff-W2K> it's an Athlon 64 3500+ system built in mid-November 2004
[23:55:25] <bomb> riff-W2K you know what, recently I thought about moving back to an early 00s machine, because I can still do a lot of stuff with that
[23:55:42] <riff-W2K> triple-boot between Win98SE, Windows 2000 Professional SP4 (with the Extended Kernel and USP5.1 installed), and WinXP64 Pro
[23:55:44] * riff-W2K node
[23:55:46] <riff-W2K> *nods
[23:55:47] <bomb> riff-W2K namely, ACID for music production, Macromedia Flash for graphics, Vegas for editing
[23:55:55] <riff-W2K> yea
[23:56:10] <riff-W2K> install an old version of Sony Vegas, or.. lemme look
[23:56:32] <riff-W2K> Pinnacle Studio, drop in a FireWire card, and do some early-00s video editing!
[23:56:40] <bomb> you use stuff from oldversion.com?
[23:56:58] <riff-W2K> maybe record myself driving around in my '99 Dodge Ram 1500 to add to the period-correctness
[23:57:07] <bomb> hehe
[23:57:31] <bomb> try this if you want to do some programming too: https://www.purebasic.com/
[23:57:41] <bomb> very nice interface to winapi
[23:57:47] <riff-W2K> digitize it using something like PCWinCap and put it together in Pinnacle Studio
[23:58:15] <bomb> Borland Delphi 7 or maybe Lazarus
[23:58:39] * riff-W2K nods
[23:59:10] <riff-W2K> and Win2K is installed on an 80GB Maxtor IDE drive from 2002 or so
[23:59:28] <bomb> that's some durability
[23:59:52] <riff-W2K> yea
