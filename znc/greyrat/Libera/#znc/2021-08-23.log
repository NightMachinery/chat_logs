[05:04:48] <Macer> hi. i keep seeing nonsense go into hexchat in channels and i am not really sure where it is where i can stop that from happening
[05:05:48] <Macer> * #libreoffice ~quassel user/calcmandan lithium.libera.chat calcmandan H 0 calcmandan :Daniel
[05:05:50] <Macer> as an example
[05:06:15] <MetaNova> Macer: /msg *status loadmod route_replies
[05:07:40] <Macer> is that all?
[05:07:45] <Macer> is that what was causing it?
[05:09:26] <MetaNova> when you have more than one client connected to the same user/network (including client connections which are dead, but ZNC has not disconnected yet, if your client reconnects before this takes place) ZNC doesn't know which client to send stuff to
[05:09:40] <MetaNova> route_replies routes command replies to the correct client
[05:10:50] <Macer> ah ok
[05:11:28] <Macer> if i were to take a guess i'd say that it is probably textual during a "powernap" on a mac that keeps disconnecting/reconnecting
[05:11:44] <Macer> but thanks. i did not know that was where the problem was
[05:23:01] <MetaNova> no problem

[12:41:02] <bookworm> sure, historical reasons. Your client will request the ircv3 caps so no need to be worried
[12:42:13] <DarthGandalf> Koragg: some clients implemented the znc.in/ one before the standard one was finalized

[14:21:41] <DoctorD90> ah
[14:21:46] <DoctorD90> it wasnt for you :P
[14:21:51] <predicament> the documentation went from 4/10 to 9/10
[14:21:53] <predicament> straight up
[14:21:55] <predicament> fantastic job
[14:21:59] <DoctorD90> it was in generlly....it is my style when I write documentation
[14:22:06] <predicament> i like your style sir
[14:22:08] <DoctorD90> lol thanks
[14:22:18] <predicament> now it's a guide.
[14:22:20] <predicament> :)
[14:22:36] <DoctorD90> now I should also publish the OPENSSL.conf
[14:22:46] <DoctorD90> so that the certificates are issued in the correct way
[14:22:49] <predicament> there's been a few updates
[14:22:54] <predicament> to openssl
[14:22:58] <predicament> no
[14:23:00] <predicament> openssh
[14:23:03] <DoctorD90> not in these days xD
[14:23:03] <predicament> sorry my brain is everywhere
[14:23:44] <DoctorD90> yeah...but I dont care about it...I already hardned ssh on my machine :P so I dont care. Untill I will update at latest version it is not a problem for me
[14:25:10] <predicament> yeah i ddnt care much either
[14:25:11] <DoctorD90> configs for ssh could be raised a little higher than openssl cause it has to support mainly it self, so depending on the client version is possible to push it a little forward than ssl
[14:25:16] <DoctorD90> you should....
[14:25:22] <predicament> well i updated it
[14:25:22] <predicament> lol
[14:25:26] <predicament> i hardened it
[14:25:29] <DoctorD90> ssh is the 2nd most attacked service with web server
[14:25:31] <predicament> as well
[14:25:32] <predicament> yes it is
[14:25:34] <predicament> i agree
[14:25:40] <predicament> i should care in THAT regard yes

[14:52:21] <predicament> its a shitty, slow VPS
[14:52:32] <predicament> and its free so its good practice for whatever i wanna do

[14:54:11] <predicament> but i wouldn't bother installing from scratch for no reason really
[14:54:20] <predicament> whats the point in installing arch like that
[14:54:48] <predicament> its rolling release but bleeding edge rolling release
[14:54:55] <DoctorD90> free vps????
[14:55:00] <predicament> friend
[14:55:13] <predicament> he had some server he bought on ebay.
[14:55:17] <predicament> so we put it together
[14:55:23] <predicament> it was an ebay server actually
[14:55:42] <predicament> and someone was selling it
[14:55:51] <predicament> connection is what i mean by shitty

[14:55:59] <predicament> yes
[14:56:03] <DoctorD90> oh nice
[14:56:05] <DoctorD90> price?
[14:56:32] <predicament> i dont remember the price, he would remember, it was pretty cheap for an ebay server with the specs i remember it having
[14:56:49] <predicament> hes smart and doesnt even know it

[14:57:03] <DoctorD90> good

[16:32:56] <haskl> Sorry for such a newbie question, but I have noticed that my pretty much factory configuration of ZNC doesn't keep me logged into libera (I have to re-auth to nickserv after my client disconnects it seems). I'm also worried it's not keeping messages properly although I have to check that. If I recall correctly there was some checkbox I once had to enable to fix buffering, but that's a separate topic. So the first question is just about nickserv and ZNC and the 
[16:32:56] <haskl> second one is just a general request for a good ZNC newbie guide. Thanks!

[16:33:35] <haskl> I call myself a "newbie" but I've used ZNC on/off very poorly throughout the years, ha! I am just deciding to make the effort to really get a good setup now.

[16:36:22] <haskl> MetaNova, wow, thanks!
[16:36:37] <MetaNova> your second question is a bit more difficult to answer, since most people who claim "ZNC isn't caching activity" are actually unaware of ZNC's default behavior
[16:37:20] <MetaNova> (ZNC /does/ cache activity by default, but only when no clients are connected, and then erases the cached activity once it is shown to the user)
[16:37:39] <MetaNova> you could, if you wanted, enable persistent buffers
[16:37:56] <haskl> Yeah that makes sense. That reminds me, I think the issue I was having was when I was also using my phone and I had to tick some bufferonmsg feature or something?
[16:38:19] <MetaNova> if you wanted to enable persistent buffers, see https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Full_overview and perform steps #1 and #2
[16:38:24] <haskl> It's been a while since I used my ZNC server, sorry for the half-formed thoughts.
[16:38:28] <haskl> Thank you!
[16:38:54] <haskl> I'll test something. Could I ask a favor of you, MetaNova? Could you say something as soon as you notice I disconnect?
[16:39:17] <MetaNova> haskl: I won't notice if you disconnect if you're using ZNC
[16:39:33] <haskl> I forgot to say "please" lol. Oh hm... could you say something in ten seconds?
[16:39:39] <MetaNova> sure
[16:39:50] <MetaNova> haskl: this is 10 seconds later, roughly

[16:43:09] <haskl> Did I miss anything?
[16:43:30] <haskl> Also, thank you very much for helping me with testing that and for educating me.
[16:44:28] <MetaNova> no, you didn't miss anything
[16:44:36] <haskl> Great!
[16:44:42] <haskl> What wonderful software.
[16:44:55] <MetaNova> and if you toggled persistent buffers on, you should be able to disconnect your client again, and reconnect it to ZNC, again, and see the same buffer(s)
[16:45:05] <MetaNova> so that's something else you can verify real quick

[21:51:27] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, oh thank you! What were you thinking to change? Im open mind. If you like to modify cause you feel it would be better, please do it :)
[21:51:51] <DoctorD90> I dont care. My target is that people can easly follow it and accomplish steps
[21:52:36] <DoctorD90> and it can be modularly used by other pages (like cert and certauth and signeld ssl that I will update refering to the Ceertificate page :) ) 
[21:53:37] <MetaNova> DoctorD90: I don't recall, exactly
[21:54:08] <MetaNova> I would have to re-read the pages and make notes about which wordings (as there were multiple) that I thought could be improved, in order to pass them by you first
[21:54:38] <DoctorD90> in that case, just do it :)
[21:54:50] <DoctorD90> i fully agree with your experience
[21:55:17] <MetaNova> okay, cool. I didn't want to step on any toes by making any 'major' changes

[23:54:25] <Exa> Hi, some channels redirect to another channel on various conditions, for example "overflow" channels to prevent join abuse.  In this case, chansaver won't retry joining the underlying channel.  Is there a solution for this?  I don't mind having a hand-written list of channels to keep joining at first.  Thanks.
