[02:49:19] <MaxLeiter> we have the money for the app subscription, the problem is dealing with apple and such
[02:49:40] <MaxLeiter> e.g. PWAs arent allowed on the app store (although ive seen quite a few + posted one myself)
[02:50:52] <xnaas> The current rumor/theory train is that you wouldn't need the App Store for this, just them finally implementing Web Push into Safari.
[02:50:57] <xnaas> but, we'll see
[02:51:01] * xnaas is very, very skeptical
[03:41:05] <cim> Soonâ„¢ 
[03:41:28] <xnaas> Neverâ„¢ :P
[03:41:30] <xnaas> This is Apple.
