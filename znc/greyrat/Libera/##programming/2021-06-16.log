[01:16:32] <whiskyandcigars> "because these are things you google"
[01:16:52] <whiskyandcigars> I think there's way too much reliance on Google nowadays.
[01:17:25] <InPhase> paulo_: You're not up against full knowledge of an area.  You're typically up against 2-5 other people and the sum set of their core skills, background, and ability to handle random interview questions.
[01:17:53] <whiskyandcigars> If you forget the formula for some bezier curve or something.. that's understandable.. but there are certain things that should be right in the brain.
[01:19:31] <InPhase> paulo_: So you in part are presenting an image of your strengths and how you handle things that aren't.  When I get a question I don't know in an interview, I just with calm confidence explain how I would go about resolving it.  They're not going to put much weight on a person who can drop a piece of trivia quickly versus someone who declares exactly how to solve that unless there are no other more 
[01:19:37] <InPhase> meaningful differences between candidates.

[03:45:29] <arahael> Izem: the range of a declared array is also in ALGOL 58 i think.
[03:45:37] <paulo_> or, can I use either?
[03:45:47] <kiwichap> I just started doing programming with java in eclipse and it's dreadful I feel lost
[03:45:58] <beaky> i use ranged in coq and agda like for example when i get a random number in a range i get both the random number and the range it is in so i can pass it to functions that expect that range to like index data structures and they dont have to check because it has the proof that it is within the range
[03:46:15] <beaky> nice have you tried jetbrains instead of eclipse
[03:46:41] <kiwichap> is it going to be easier somehow ? I use jetbrains for android studio

[06:54:02] <beaky> yes the difference is that sigma types are a type and values of the sigma types are pairs where the type of second field depends on the value of the first field (whereas anonymous functions are like the values of pi types, which you can maybe sorta use to define sigma types i think the cedille language does that)

[11:03:03] <IanWizard> I'm trying to figure out how to (using WebGL in this case, for quick experimentation) render a set of verticies with a circle rather than as a triangle.  More gemerally: I'm trying to pass in a buffer of 2d coordinates, and draw circles around them with only a vert shader and a frag shader.  I'm *absurdly* new to working with GLSL, and I'm learning
[11:03:03] <IanWizard> on-the-fly.  Am I wrong to be trying to do this with shaders?
[11:04:34] <IanWizard> It seems like to make this work would require the frag shader rendering an entire frame for EVERY coord pair (vertex), and then blending as the final step.  Surely there's a better solution?

[11:15:11] <IanWizard> Perhaps my problem isn't what I thought it was.   If I can have a shader program that runs for individual polygon's, then I should be doing that separately from the final render pass.

[18:42:33] <networker> a litle historical question, i was reading some articles and came across this "BASIC
[18:42:33] <networker> was easy to learn, it wasn’t very powerful, and its lack of structure made its usefulness
[18:42:33] <networker> questionable for large programs", why "lack of structure" ?
[18:42:41] <networker> whoops, sorry, didn't mean to split it into three lines
[18:42:43] <mrig> I would state that common tongue is vulgar, but would not want to upset an vulgar people in the room; That would be against all sense of ethical reason :D
[18:42:54] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[18:43:29] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I mean BASIC isn't much worse for large programs than assembly or old school FORTRAN.
[18:43:32] <mrig> networker: I did not find basic easy to learn, it turned me off of programming, really wish that i'd had someone who had showed me asm when I had a c64.
[18:43:44] <pulse> networker, they probably meant there was no good way to structure a large program
[18:43:52] <pulse> but then again the same can be said of assembly
[18:43:58] <pulse> the real reason is that BASIC was slow as hell
[18:44:09] <mrig> I could not understand why the graphical output had noting to do with the games that I would have like to have explored.
[18:44:12] <pulse> if you wanted to do anything useful at all you did it with assembly
[18:44:18] <pulse> and later on, C
[18:44:34] <Thedarkb-Desktop> In BASIC's heyday, even C was considered a slow language.
[18:44:48] <mrig> Whats good for some is not good for everyone.
[18:44:52] <networker> mrig: wait what, how is asm easier to learn than Basic ?
[18:45:12] <mrig> networker: I would have taken to asm as a kid, had I been shown it.
[18:45:21] <mrig> love the logic of it all.
[18:45:41] <networker> yea, that is pretty low-level and provide good understanding of systems... but the part "easier to learn", is a bit weird
[18:45:59] <mrig> I  copied out basic from magazines and all but could not understand why the programs had no resemblance to the games that I enjoyed.
[18:46:18] <mrig> networker: not easier, more attractive.
[18:46:19] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I took to ASM pretty well as a kid in the ROM hacking community.
[18:46:37] <mrig> I think I would have done, had I been exposed back then.

[21:27:20] <jeaye> teut: Caching is when you store the result of an expensive operation so that you don't have to do it again; instead, you can just look up the cached result. The difficulty comes when the operation may have different results at different times, so using the cached result may be out of date with what you'd get if you did the operation again. So you need a way to "invalidate" the cache. Doing
[21:27:22] <jeaye> this efficiently and correctly can be difficult.

[23:37:11] <recursiveNode> Have u ever deal with scaling Kafka using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler? I wonder how you've determined the kafka_consumergroup_lag at which you want to add a new broker pod.

[23:42:47] <recursiveNode> when Kafka runs as a Kubernetes Pod it's easy, you just deploy another pod called kafka-exporter. But when Kafka runs outside of Kubernetes, what is the best way to collect metrics from it?
