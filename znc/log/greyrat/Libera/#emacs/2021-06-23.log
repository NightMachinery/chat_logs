[05:43:57] <wheeler> ERC isn't honoring erc-channel-hide-list
[05:44:10] <wheeler> Is it working for anyone else?
[05:44:22] <prettymuchbryce> Hello. I'm brand new to emacs and using SpaceMacs (coming from vim). I'm currently down a rabbit hole of remapping hjkl to jkl; (more ergonomic for me). I figured out how to do this for normal and state maps, but there are other places such as moving between splits which I'm still looking for. Is there a place I can easily see where all key bindings are defined in my configuration so I that I can hunt these down?

[05:49:40] <johnjay> speaking of key chords i'm experimenting with key-chord a little
[05:49:54] <wheeler> How's it working, johnjay?
[05:49:55] <prettymuchbryce> @wheeler Thanks. I'm embarrassed to say I wasn't aware of C-h yet. This should help considerably.
[05:50:02] <johnjay> i've found Q,W,Z,X, and V are good letters based on their letter frequency in english
[05:50:15] <johnjay> e.g. you can do qw,qd,qx, etc and not have problems
[05:50:37] <johnjay> i think using ds as a keychord is pushing it though. it has like .14% freq and i see it a lot
[05:50:52] <johnjay> like e.g. dst, commands, bounds, words ending in d
[05:51:02] <wheeler> prettymuchbryce: Yeah! A fellow Emacser at work introduced me to it and my learning increased considerably!
[05:51:33] <johnjay> in general hydra is probably more efficient for this sort of hotkey stuff
[05:51:34] <wheeler> prettymuchbryce: You can even do C-h C-h to get help on help
[05:51:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> wheeler: C-h i  and its collection of info manuals is pretty useful.

[05:53:45] <johnjay> by my calculation 73% of the two letter combos you can reach with your left hand on qwer, asdf, and zxcv are < .1% freq in english
[05:53:53] <wheeler> ecbrown: But I want to preserve these messages for the less busy channels and only hide them from #emacs and other channels with high frequency joins/parts
[05:54:11] <johnjay> so that's roughly 2/3 of the combos. ti's probably most of them without the a and e

[05:54:55] <wheeler> johnjay: seems like it might be especially helpful for 60% and fewer key keyboards
[05:55:07] <bremner> can erc hide joins/parts from lurkers ?
[05:55:12] <wheeler> Yep!
[05:55:19] <wheeler> (setq erc-lurker-hide-list '(("JOIN" "PART" "QUIT" "MODE")))
[05:55:32] <bremner> right. that's enough for me in circe
[05:55:33] <johnjay> if you exclude a and e then it's 90%
[05:55:55] <johnjay> so just pick a random combo without a or e and it's likely to be a useful bigram
[05:56:06] <johnjay> the 10% is stuff like ds

[14:05:59] <unixbhaskar> Well, trying to use weather-metno and it is throwing some error ...could you people shed some light?
[14:06:45] <japhir> hey all! I'm having issues when I start a new ess-R session from C-c C-c'ing on an org R source code block. The window appears for half a second and then is buried again. I now have to C-x 3, C-x o, C-x b <buffer name> to get to the state I want. Any pointers on where to look for new window placement? Should I look inside ess docs or in org-mode?

[14:12:52] <unixbhaskar> I have same problem with openstreetmap.org ...the api returns perfectly alright in browser ..but in emacs .it just said ...contacting api.openweathermap.org ....
[14:13:09] <unixbhaskar> Wondering ...I must be missing something very obvious ..honestly ...
[14:14:17] <contrapunctus> I have a macro and its call site here - http://ix.io/3qOJ/elisp It's supposed to insert `[<timestamp>] ... <task>: <list of integers>` in a buffer; everything is fine in the output, except instead of a <list of integers> I get a single integer...and when I change it from a macro to a function it works correctly. What gives?
[14:14:23] <bpalmer> unixbhaskar: perhaps you are using a proxy for your web browser and not for emacs?

[18:22:35] <bewees> hi, is there anything wrong with old emacs packages? Emacs packages don't have to be regulary updated like linux packages that require frequent updates against security concerns right?
[18:22:54] <wasamasa> I update when needed
[18:23:00] *** Joins: davidkrauser (~davidkrau@user/davidkrauser)
[18:23:10] <wasamasa> to get a new feature or fix a bug (like incompatibility with new emacs)
[18:23:26] <bewees> oh perfect, so I disable the auto updating and only update when I see things break
[18:23:32] <sappho> I'm no expert, but I'd imagine that if the package has any components that come in contact with the internet it could be a security concern
[18:23:35] <bremner> bewees: some emasc packages do network or crypto related stuff, I'd be more concerned about those
[18:23:49] <bremner> like easy-pg (although that's core now, iirc)
[18:23:55] <wasamasa> yeah, that
[18:24:00] <bewees> bremner: not having those installed luckily, just have some basic packages like org mode
[18:24:01] *** Parts: theseus (~tadeas@185-219-166-254-static.vivo.cz) ()
[18:24:06] <sappho> if it's just like, a major mode for editing a file type or something, that's probably not a security concern
[18:24:13] <wasamasa> if you write a package doing things in a lazy way, that's your fault
[18:24:22] <wasamasa> no amount of updating will fix that
[18:24:32] <bewees> because with auto-updating emacs packages I worried about security conerns, but when I update only when needed I can verify all packages manually against hash from github
[18:24:38] *** Joins: theseus (~tadeas@185-219-166-254-static.vivo.cz)
[18:25:01] <wasamasa> the irony is that emacs is inherently at odds with modern security practices

[18:25:54] <bewees> yes, but I have no alternative to emacs, using org made daily. i wil simply reduce packages and update manually when necessary :-)
[18:26:02] <bewees> mode*
[18:26:17] <wasamasa> I've given people code reviews to fix security issues for stuff that hasn't been turned into packages
[18:26:31] <necronian> I'm trying out fido, tramp completion doesn't work how I expect fido doesn't show the completions for the tramp commands.
[18:26:33] <grym> language half-lives are interesting 
[18:26:38] <wasamasa> other packages do intentionally do unsafe stuff on purpose
[18:26:39] <necronian> c-x c-f /s doesn't bring up /ssh: or /sudo: in the fido list and /ssh: doesn't show hosts from my ssh config. Is there a way to make icomplete/fido aware of tramp?
[18:26:58] <davidkrauser> wasamasa: rms was always against lots of security best practices in general, so I'm not surprised
[18:27:01] <wasamasa> like doing unauthenticated socket communication for a repl server

[21:22:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I wonder why TTY experience isn't more like eshell.
[21:23:03] <wgreenhouse> Aurora_v_kosmose: say more
[21:23:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Being able to scroll back and kill/yank previous output is incredibly useful for things like autogenerated device UUIDs.
[21:25:33] <wgreenhouse> Aurora_v_kosmose: oh, yeah. in TTY prehistory that'd be a feature enabled in local video terminal firmware, rather than in the OS kernel tty driver implementation 
[21:26:19] <wgreenhouse> or in raw mode in a fancy shell that bypasses the default "line discipline"
[21:26:48] <yeti> you still can have lots of scrollback in xterm and screen
[21:27:02] <wgreenhouse> and even some in the naked linux console
[21:27:10] <johnjay> wasamasa: i guess you could always get the wysiwig stuff with a split buffer sure

[21:55:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> pdfview uses the normal revert function first before rerendering.

[23:21:45] <grym> oh, 1. is a good question 
[23:21:45] <rudybot> bremner: I asked `MemoServ' to forward the message to dale.
[23:21:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It does.
[23:21:55] <Hash> oh cool.
[23:22:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I just send myself a memo.

[23:22:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So I managed to send it, but I can't read it
[23:22:52] <grym> it's the thought that counts
[23:23:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I even got notification that I have a memo and everything.
[23:23:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But I can't read it.
[23:23:32] <dale> I got bremner's message fine.
[23:23:46] <dale> Aurora_v_kosmose: You did something like "/msg memoserv read 1"?
[23:23:49] <bremner> maybe just talking to yourself is verboten?

[23:56:29] <danrobi70>  `previous-buffer`
[23:58:09] <ro7> is there any way to unset the binding C-c C-x C-c? it does such terrible and unremovable things to an org file that I feel like it's some kind of practical joke
[23:58:29] <pjb> Bayes: q  will hide the customization buffer.
[23:58:50] <Bayes> pjb oh that's was too easy
