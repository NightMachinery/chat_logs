[10:16:53] <imode> nintendo now has approximately $60 of my money.
[10:17:27] <imode> I had to know what I was judging before I judged it. fuck the company, but is the product worth anything.
[10:17:39] <Geekingfrog> I think I'll try Dread, but bought second hand to avoid Nintendo to get any money
[10:17:54] <Geekingfrog> maybe
[10:18:00] <imode> it's good.
[10:18:22] <imode> the devs love to tease you, though.
[10:18:24] <imode> heavily.
[10:19:09] <imode> I'm hoping Prime 4 isn't a figment of my imagination because I played Dread for 8-10 hours straight.
[10:20:22] <Geekingfrog> the one already restarted twice ? :D
[10:20:42] <imode> was it restarted -again-.
[10:21:14] <Geekingfrog> uhm, maybe just once, it's been very quiet for a while
[10:21:31] <imode> very quiet.
[10:21:42] <imode> I hope they crank it up to 11.
[10:21:43] <Geekingfrog> I do like that they have the will and money to take their time to make great games though. That reminds me of the old blizzard

[10:33:22] <dimadima> this, uh, startup thing i'm getting off the ground
[10:33:33] <dimadima> dare i paste the link?
[10:34:50] <dimadima> let's see how buttsbot handles this
[10:34:53] <dimadima> https://www.ponymessenger.com/
[10:34:53] <buttsbot> Pony
[10:34:58] <dimadima> hmm
[10:35:05] <dimadima> just the title
[10:35:54] <dcz> oh, cool idea
[10:36:19] <dcz> this could be done as a part of an XMPP server
[10:36:25] <dimadima> :)
[10:36:47] <dimadima> i'm very not familiar with XMPP
[10:36:56] <dimadima> not since pidgin back in the day
[10:37:18] <dimadima> and, well, google chat or whatever it was called back then
[10:37:21] <dcz> more generally - it seems like something that could be part of any messaging system with a tiny bit of integration
[10:37:54] * dcz replies to emails with a few days delay for less frantic exchanges
[10:38:21] <dimadima> yeah this kind of automates/enforces that delay
[10:38:57] <dimadima> it's meant to be a "consumer product"
[10:39:20] <dcz> does it hide messages until the time out, or does it prevent sending?
[10:39:52] <dimadima> you write a message, and there's no send button. instead, you put it in your outbox, where it chills until your once day pickup
[10:39:57] <dimadima> it's like if email was mail
[10:40:25] <dimadima> from your outbox you can put it back to drafts, edit it, discard it, if it hasn't been picked up yet
[10:40:35] <dcz> snail mail actually hides messages, you hit send instantly but then it's disappeared for a while
[10:40:49] <dimadima> that's that's a good point, the analogy leaks
[10:41:03] <dimadima> or maybe i'm not undertanding
[10:41:10] <dimadima> you mean like when you drop something in a mailbox?
[10:41:13] <dcz> editing is actually the killer part, you can simmer the thoughts for a while
[10:41:15] <dcz> yes
[10:41:38] <dimadima> ah yes so it depends on the kind of mailbox. if you drop something in a common, public mailbox then yo ucan't retrieve it
[10:41:59] <dimadima> but if you have a personal mailbox, like single homes in the US have, then the above analogy holds
[10:42:20] <dcz> you still can't take it back from the mail box and edit it, can you :P?
[10:43:00] <dimadima> yeah "simmering" may be a bad sideeffect of this if that's the kind of thing you do. i've been using this a while with some people, and i do edit some messages a lot, but i've appreciated the net effect a lot. send a lot fewer "douchy" messages lol
[10:43:15] <dimadima> yeah you'd have to open the envelope and all that
[10:43:29] <dimadima> but you can take if back if you're willing to go that far :)
[10:43:32] <dimadima> if i'm understandign you right
[10:43:37] <dcz> ...or is this a cultural mailbox difference? the only mailbox I can access I've ever seen is the one I have a key to
[10:44:08] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[10:44:34] <dimadima> so i the united states we have these public mailboxes http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-elQzMSAnG78Uxw31nfvnA/o.jpg
[10:44:45] <dimadima> once you drop something in there, it's gone for good
[10:44:53] <dcz> yeah, that
[10:44:56] <dcz> is similar
[10:45:21] <dimadima> but then if you have a single home, it will have something like this https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.qT7BV-lENghpUCgHx1qBNQHaIO%26pid%3DApi&f=1
[10:45:44] <gerikson> wait those are for sending too?!
[10:45:48] <dcz> that's locked, right?
[10:46:01] <dimadima> the second one? that's open
[10:46:11] <dcz> that's the crucial difference then
[10:46:14] <dimadima> america is a friendly trusting place
[10:46:15] <dimadima> lol
[10:46:29] <dimadima> gerikson: yeah you send w/ those too
[10:46:47] <dcz> over here mailboxes are locked, and the gravity (tries to) prevent anyone from retrieving mail inside
[10:46:55] <dimadima> leave stuff in the mailbox, mailperson comes and drops off the mail and pick up whatever you have in there
[10:47:03] <gerikson> wow TIL
[10:47:09] <gerikson> I mean it makes sense but still
[10:47:23] <dimadima> gerikson: tbh i still don't believe it after all these years lol
[10:47:38] <dimadima> my parents moved to a single home like 8 years ago and i still don't trust that thing
[10:48:03] <dcz> sending mail goes to the post office or a public box, and the only time private mailbox is used for dropping off is when you're the post worker
[10:48:06] <dimadima> dcz: even for private houses? are you in europe?
[10:48:10] <dcz> yup
[10:48:13] <gerikson> if they originated in rural areas in the late 19th C it makes a lot of sense
[10:48:39] <gerikson> yeah that's my experience too
[10:48:49] <dimadima> yeah the united states is ... friendly and trusting what can i say
[10:49:18] <gerikson> some big apt buildings had a grid of individual boxes for each apt, and then one public outgoing box (locked,only post worker had the key)
[10:49:25] <gerikson> but that was a long time ago
[10:49:34] <dimadima> i grew up with something like this https://woodburyhoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thumbnail-1-1-1536x893.jpeg
[10:50:14] <dcz> that looks familiar
[10:51:00] <dimadima> i think probably in reality the single family home american mailbox isn't worth robbing
[10:51:14] <dcz> although the lack of slots is surprising, post workers would have to carry keys to all boxes?
[10:51:19] <dimadima> i suspect not much mail is lost like that
[10:51:30] <dimadima> they have a master key
[10:51:37] <dcz> fair enough
[10:51:39] <dimadima> that opens most if not all of the mailboxes
[10:51:45] <dimadima> that's how it is in new york city
[10:52:26] <dimadima> there's a lot of package theft in the US and that's because packages are just left whereever all the time
[10:52:30] <dcz> I think that's more common here in places where the administration sorts and delivers the last leg of the mail journey
[10:53:58] <dimadima> what's more common
[10:54:11] <dcz> master keys
[10:54:15] <dimadima> ah
[10:54:41] <dimadima> europe seems to mess around less w/ mail

[18:26:24] <gerikson> and now I have a shorter commute
[18:30:10] <dimadima> hitler was a sick fuck
[18:30:12] <dimadima> Hitler had awakened and, as he says was his custom, was reclining on his cot in the barracks of the 2nd Infantry Regiment watching the mice nibble at the bread crumbs which he invariably scattered on the floor the night before.
[18:30:28] <dimadima> feeding the mice, man
[18:30:30] <dimadima> lol
[18:32:35] <ngoldbaum> hitler was the original bad art friend
[18:32:46] <dimadima> lol
[18:32:47] <dimadima> yes
[18:32:55] <dimadima> shittiest roommate ever

[18:37:46] <deadk> but then what were you going to do about such a failure anyway? complain? to standard output?
[18:41:25] <mouseghost> dimadima, hey, at least you got a conversion
[18:42:19] <dimadima> mouseghost: for sure!
[18:42:39] <mouseghost> dimadima, how much do you charge for your product?
[18:42:54] <dimadima> free at this time
[18:42:58] <mouseghost> what does it do?
[18:43:08] <dimadima> it's a messenger that delivers once a day
[18:44:00] <dimadima> revenue concepts are 1) newsletters like substack 2) advertising but, uh, not horrible advertising
[18:44:23] <dimadima> it's all about periodicity, so something like "circulars" if you know what those are
[18:44:31] <dimadima> i've always enjoyed circulars
[18:45:38] <dimadima> have always wanted a communication platform that isn't in-your-face with the engagement

[21:13:36] <gerikson> he was very into bitcoin
[21:13:36] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[21:13:46] <gerikson> now he's very into invermectin
[21:17:56] <riv> oh god i hated that fucker
[21:18:07] <riv> i think troll is the wrong word to describe him
[21:18:19] <riv> i think he's actually just insane
[21:22:22] <imode> gerikson: he's about to be very into death.
[21:23:17] <mouseghost> maybe i should verify it formally
[21:23:22] <mouseghost> and then i will be more confident about it
[21:23:23] <mouseghost> hm
[21:23:23] <riv> whats going on with people
[21:23:40] <riv> i understand a fair of people being insane shitheads
[21:24:02] <riv> but i can't get my head around this thing where people want random medicines that aren't relevant
[21:24:38] <riv> being scared of needles and pretending you're a tough guy who doesn't believe that vaccines are safe is one thing
[21:25:04] <riv> but taking some random other medicine? what's going on in their heads (other than nothing)
[21:25:37] <dimadima> it's a cult riv

[22:22:14] <imode> weird observation: using unary as an intermediary number format for this language is better than using traditional binary numbers because the instruction count is smaller and an optimizing compiler/interpreter will understand what you mean anyway.
[22:22:50] <riv> which language
[22:23:11] <imode> my lil' BF-like. https://hastebin.com/raw/wijuqeqote
[22:23:54] <riv> ooh i like this
[22:24:30] <imode> working on a little optimizing compiler and interpreter.
[22:24:40] <imode> a unary 'add' looks like 0[1]0<[0<]<[1<<]0<[0<]
[22:24:53] <riv> ah right
[22:25:07] <riv> i imagine  multiplication is a little harder :P
[22:25:23] <imode> well multiplication is just repeated addition.
[22:25:32] <imode> so you can build multiplication and division on top of addition and subtraction.
[22:25:53] <imode> and 'add' is just "start at the head of a number, go to the next zero, drop the zero, go back to the start of the number".
[22:26:26] <imode> whereas just to get an 'inc' primitive for some number of bits takes like 202 instructions for a byte.
[22:26:38] <riv> I guess it's not too hard to implement dup and dec
[22:26:48] <riv> why are we naturally building forthy words in this?
[22:26:49] <imode> but that's assuming you don't re-encode your bytes as sequences of 10 and 110.
[22:26:58] <imode> because it's based around a deque instead of a tape.
[22:27:09] <imode> and you can arbitrarily insert and delete data.
[22:27:19] <riv> i think this is really elegant
[22:32:14] <imode> https://hastebin.com/iweyequnij.py
[22:32:14] <buttsbot> hastebin
[22:32:25] <imode> here's an interpreter along with some useful primitives.
[22:32:27] <imode> go nuts.
[22:33:19] <imode> _inc and _dec take an optional length parameter so you can choose your word length.
[22:34:38] <imode> you can use similar things to construct BF primitives that work on different cell sizes.
[22:36:02] <imode> riv: https://hastebin.com/owukurufir.py here's the rough start to a compiler that reduces stuff down to the level of C-macro-like invocations.
[22:36:02] <buttsbot> hastebin
[22:37:45] <imode> https://hastebin.com/raw/ororuraxir if you run the decrement example through it.
[22:37:51] <riv> ah nice!
[22:42:04] <imode> though 'dec' and 'inc for a unary number are just... [0<] and 1<, probably with some wrapper logic around checking for zero on dec.

[23:39:34] <dimadima> you're not fooling anybody imode
[23:39:55] <dimadima> unless you're one of those general dynamics dog things

[23:40:43] <dimadima> hehehe
[23:40:48] <dimadima> you got my reference
[23:41:03] <imode> older than dirt.
[23:42:22] <dimadima> so tired. i was up so late last night
[23:42:42] <dimadima> something wrong with me where i forget how certain feelings feel
[23:42:52] <dimadima> unless i'm sick, i can't really remember how it feels to be sick
[23:43:06] <dimadima> unless i'm sleep deprived, i can't actually remember how it feels to be sleep deprived
[23:43:46] <dimadima> i can kind of remember what being drunk is like without being drunk, maybe kinda sorta
[23:43:59] <dimadima> but most things i can't
[23:44:16] <dimadima> i feel like it prevents me from making the right decision; such as going to sleep
[23:47:58] <imode> CBD keeps my mood equalized. perhaps you should try some.
[23:49:16] <dimadima> i've been a stoned-when-awake person on and off for a bunch of recent history and i think because of that CBD doesn't do much for me
[23:49:20] <dimadima> much/anything
[23:49:29] <dimadima> i've tried it, no discernable effect
[23:50:05] <dimadima> why did you mention it, anyway
[23:50:13] <dimadima> it and mood equalization
[23:50:27] <imode> just that it helps curb some similar symptoms that you're experiencing.
[23:50:37] <dimadima> that is princiaplly why i enjoy THC
[23:51:20] <dimadima> imode: but how did you discern any symptoms when i didn't state any
[23:51:47] <imode> "something wrong with me where I forget how certain things feel" is pretty much a symptom.
[23:51:58] <dimadima> really?
[23:52:08] <imode> yyyup. I have that in cycles.
[23:52:13] <dimadima> i don't of that as any kind of patholgoy
[23:52:16] <dimadima> pathology
[23:52:19] <imode> usually accompanies massive depressive cycles.
[23:52:30] <imode> which is then followed by manic cycles.
[23:53:08] <dimadima> i'm a bit bipolar but not pathologically, either... or so i think. my main pathology i'd say is something like OCD
[23:53:19] <dimadima> negative thoughts-dwelling?
[23:53:36] <dimadima> but not manically
[23:53:42] <dimadima> just consistently :)
