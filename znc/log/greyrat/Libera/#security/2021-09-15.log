[04:18:47] <wilsonfisk> backdoors and exploits require a certain level of secrecy. Your backdoor would be absolutely useless if it's discussed and making 0-days public knowledge kills almost all use they have.

[10:00:22] <electr0n_> eh its usually pulling a generic high-level jobdesc from other postings, but sure.
[10:00:44] <electr0n_> Hydragyrum: most employer's have somewhat of an idea of what they want, you need to go in there and TELL them what they want is you.
[10:00:47] <Hydragyrum> do you know a better way to determine which certs employers want?
[10:01:03] <Hydragyrum> i.e. in terms of deciding which certs to get

[10:01:20] <electr0n_> Hydragyrum: what field? networking/security/cloud ?
[10:01:30] <Hash> These are the additional certs the college needs me to have in order to graduate.
[10:01:40] <electr0n_> wait what?
[10:01:41] <Hash> minus the stackable ones, is about 9 certs
[10:01:47] <Hash> 10 if you count CEH
[10:01:53] <Hash> or whatever it was
[10:01:56] <Hash> no EC coucil stuff
[10:02:03] <electr0n_> they are making you have additional certs to graduate you from their institution? seriously?
[10:02:12] <Hash> Yeah I told you didn't I

[10:08:11] <electr0n_> I mean if the program was challenging and tough in and of itself, there would be no need for the extra carricular activities.
[10:08:15] <Hash> I mean, I have to do not only the actual course, but a certification in addition to pass the class. The certification is supplemnetal to the college course. If you pass exam, you get allowed to take a certification exam. If you don't pass you don't get certification
[10:08:19] <Hash> Perhaps.
[10:08:40] <electr0n_> but at the same time, I think its an advantage to graduate with the degree and industry recognized certifications.
[10:08:42] <Hash> A larger body of educators and security professional think in the opposite school of thought
[10:08:50] <Hash> Oh definitely

[10:09:58] <electr0n_> out of that list, I would concentrate on the ISC ones, Certified Cloud Security Professional and Systems Security Certified Practitioner.

[16:09:04] <JAYNE> Ok, I have a key in plain text , how to decrypt it? There is so may encryption algorithms . I think is like rot13 but i tried there is rot1 ~ rot47 different versions.
[16:10:18] <JAYNE> i think is easy for cryptographers its not like AES or ed25519 as example :)

[19:37:01] <bn_work> On the surface the 1st link seems like a "phishing" attempt but oddly it seems to link to some python coding e-book ad which is odd considering the domain www.repssi.org is some non-profit site.  The 2nd link though is concerning though as it references an old DNS entry and our domain.  I was thinking this might be some sort of reverse DNS reputation-tarnishing "blackmail" attempt but no demands were made so I am puzzled and
[19:37:01] <bn_work> wondering what the motivations of the sender is?  is it just some random non-profit dev who wrote a reverse-DNS lookup script blasting info@<reverse_lookup_domain_result> trying to advertise their "services"?

[22:19:30] <Hydragyrum> i.e. if you're using TOTP it'll be different from U2F

[23:24:33] <z023> LIY i heard about that
[23:24:42] <Hash> I could have sold a lucrative financial software
[23:24:46] <z023> the government basically buried that guy iirc
[23:24:50] <shibboleth> z023, if you're on ios/iphone you're kinda f-ed since you can't change much

[23:25:07] <TheRedRipper> z023: whom?
[23:25:17] <z023> shibboleth i am and the lack of kernel access sucks
[23:25:31] <TheRedRipper> oofies
[23:25:34] <shibboleth> but on qualcomm-based droids, you can actually disable support for sms using qpst
[23:25:43] <LIY> What are you talking? You mean is security news ti discuss in that channel but here #security is better to talk about weed and alchohol and talibans right.....
[23:26:03] <z023> shibboleth they can send you messages in many ways
[23:26:05] <TheRedRipper> my school computers still havent patched the kernelconnect vulnerability in thier win10 machines... yikes
[23:26:18] <TheRedRipper> LIY: xD
[23:26:18] <z023> TheRedRipper my school computers are never patched
[23:26:31] <d3fn> they should be more worried about their azure instances
[23:26:35] <z023> my old school was still vulnerable to eternalblue as of 2018
[23:26:49] <TheRedRipper> shibboleth: does jailbreaking change anything fir iOS based devices anyways?
[23:27:00] <TheRedRipper> i heard you can add extra passwords to apps and such
[23:27:09] <TheRedRipper> tbh might jailbreak my old iphone 6
[23:27:16] <z023> TheRedRipper jailbreaking gives you kernel code execution and r/w to the whole filesystem
[23:27:17] <TheRedRipper> z023: aeouF
[23:27:22] <TheRedRipper> z023: hot
[23:27:31] <shibboleth> no public tools for changing things like that
[23:28:43] <LIY> i cant jailbreak mm 6.0.1 with locked bootloader no matter i do.
[23:28:47] <shibboleth> on qualcomm droids you can change the variables that the baseband reads on boot you can disable weak crypto ciphers (like a5/1), disable sms support, etc etc
[23:29:24] <shibboleth> LIY, dunno if you need root
[23:29:28] <TheRedRipper> hmmst
[23:29:42] <shibboleth> you only have to enable the DIAG iface, you can do this with a dialler code iirc
