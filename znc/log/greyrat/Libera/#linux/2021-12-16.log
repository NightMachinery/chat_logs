[00:53:31] <xx> lovetruth: you never avoid using symmetric keys in gpg
[00:53:42] <lovetruth> And having a single "master key" that doesn't have to change simplifies things. But having one single symmetric key complicates management of those old keys (if I want to decrypt an old encrypted archive)

[00:55:07] <lovetruth> ayecee, what strategy would you propose then for my use case scenario?...
[00:55:11] <cottnn> kernelspace: yeah but i meant that i want to have a flash drive that can boot on anything basically, so i'd have 2 systems on it, one x64 and the other x32 (with MBR), and i think grub is 32bit, since i've selected i386-pc as a target when installing on a 64bit machine
[00:55:14] <ayecee> lovetruth: the key for the document is part of the document. the key is encrypted with the public key of the recipients.
[00:55:29] <cottnn> so that i can just select which one i want to boot depending on the hardware
[00:55:33] <ayecee> lovetruth: i'd propose you use normal gpg. there's nothing special about your scenario.

[02:43:43] <CoolerVoid> HiddenWall is a Linux kernel module generator for custom rules with netfilter. (block ports, Hidden mode, rootkit functions, etc.). The motivation: in a bad situation, an attacker can put your iptables/ufw to fall. But if you have HiddenWall, the attacker will not find the hidden kernel module that blocks external access because it has a hook to
[02:43:43] <CoolerVoid> netfilter on kernel land(think like a second layer for Firewall).
[02:43:44] <CoolerVoid> My beginning purpose at this project is to protect my server, and now it is to protect my friends' machines. When I talk to friends, I say peoples that don't know how to write low-level code. Using the HiddenWall, you can generate your custom kernel module for your firewall configuration. https://github.com/CoolerVoid/HiddenWall

[07:52:19] <Shortstop> ah you're right typo
[07:52:24] <Shortstop> I got a super detailed error though now
[07:52:25] <Shortstop> one sec
[07:52:30] <Shortstop> will try to see if I can get netcat on there

[07:53:25] <jim> [[nettcat]]
[07:53:27] <Shortstop> dang I can't remember how to redirect an error to a file
[07:53:32] <jim> oops
[07:53:35] <Shortstop> I think its with 2&<1
[07:53:43] <jim> if you have nc installed, you can pastebin the output of an arbitrary command, for example ls -CF if you run it like this: ls -CF | nc termbin.com 9999
[07:53:50] <Shortstop> and I don't think 'nc' is installed on Debian by default *
[07:54:04] <Shortstop> yeah jim I know that, just trying to figure that out on a fresh install of Debian 10
[07:54:15] <Shortstop> probably netcat is in a network utilities repo
[07:54:33] <jim> I don't think so either, the debian package name is netcat
[07:54:52] <rcf> Do they ship curl at least?
[07:55:09] *** Quits: lsrtl__ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:55:13] <rcf> In that case one can use curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io

[09:22:40] <evidlo> Psi-Jack, the application being paused is the GUI for an eink tablet.  We want to pause it so third party launchers can draw over it in the framebuffer temporarily, then resume the application
[09:23:09] * Psi-Jack tilts his head. "As a systemd-managed service?......
[09:24:20] <tangy> does the watchdog have a watchlist?
[09:25:05] <evidlo> Some launchers have eschewed systemd and launch the GUI program on their own, meaning no watchdog.  This is a problem for me, because I have a background program that needs to be able to restart that GUI (normally done through systemctl)

[11:26:57] <cxl_> Hi all, I don't understand where all my RAM goes. If I look at htop, order by mem%use, the top process uses 4.9% of the RAM and the next uses 1.1%, and then 0.0. Yet when I open the system monitor, it shows I'm using 12GB of RAM (not counting cache), and my swap is 50% full... on a machine with 16GB of RAM. A little while later, the top memory user in htop uses 6.7%, and the second 1.7% and then 0.0%, but now
[11:27:03] <cxl_> my RAM usage is 6GB only (and swap still at 800mb). How do I make any sense of these number to understand where the RAM usage is coming from and why a higher percentage in htop translates to LESS use in RAM??

I can see that with ‘for d in /dev/sdg*; do fuser -v "$d"; done’ or ‘lsof -nP | grep sdg’, but the former can misfire if there's /dev/sdga, and the latter is very slow too.

[13:29:52] <cdown> hexnewbie: does ceph keep an open O_WRITE file descriptor? if so i would have thought you can't even unmount
[13:30:09] *** root___x86 is now known as yashraj466
[13:30:15] <cdown> oh wait, it uses the block device directly?
[13:30:25] * cdown knows nothing about ceph
[13:30:26] <matsaman> hexnewbie: you should pretty easily be able to fix your /dev/sdg* to only match /dev/sdg7, for example

[13:30:57] <hexnewbie> cdown: It uses the block device directly (for some older versions not using bluestore, it also uses mounts, but still opens some devices directly)

[13:33:21] <cdown> matsaman's suggestion to use `for d in /dev/sdg[0-9]*` should be ok.

[13:34:34] <cdown> the only problem is if you start using devices with namespacing, where we start using numbers again but with a different scheme, but this doesn't apply for `/dev/sd` naming.

[22:01:27] <ThothCastel> Dagmar: thank you - so how can i ensure that ldap users when created that they will have different UID as to the local user accounts?
[22:01:40] <Dagmar> Use different regions of numbers.
[22:01:57] <Dagmar> For example, it's pretty common for AD to have uids that start at around sixty-four jillion
[22:02:23] <Dagmar> Generally there's not a lot of overlap between that and the uids defined locally on the system, so they can both function at the same time no problem
[22:02:44] <Dagmar> I think 10,000 is the usual place for LDAP user enumeration to start

[23:45:27] <uwharrie> or you could edit them outside the container, rebuild it, then test. maybe not as instant a source of feedback, but better for reproducability

[23:47:58] <mrfb> no!
[23:48:11] * mrfb ragequits and get back to netflix
[23:48:14] * msiism ships a container containing a sick load of carbs, and a few bottles of Vim.

[23:48:22] <kfrench> uwharrie: Too big.  You can't have cat either.
[23:48:58] <msiism> Just use mouse.
[23:49:59] <kfrench> uwharrie: I mean, that 573k worth of data for vim-minimal will cause the entire ecosystem to collapse
[23:50:00] <mrfb> bn_work: as for your questions, use debian images, easier to fat them with thousand of packages available :D
[23:50:37] <bn_work> justsomeguy: but what if the host is a different arch completely?  on some platforms Docker actually literally runs in a VM
[23:50:40] <ananke> just apt-get/apt whatever you need as you go
[23:51:23] <bn_work> ananke: you consider vim a "big text editor"?

[23:51:50] <Sauvin> It's likely bigger than nano.

[23:54:26] <Sauvin> Wait... you've got Linux running in a VM and it's going to be a HOST?
[23:54:42] <Sauvin> That would make Windows a... what? Superhost?
[23:55:03] <mrfb> probably a cloud instance
[23:55:05] <justsomeguy> Sauvin: Docker for desktop runs a linux VM to act as a host operating system, so that it can run containers within it.
[23:55:12] <justsomeguy> Sauvin: On MS Windows.

[23:55:43] <justsomeguy> ...and it confuses beginners, because they think containers are VMs, instead of running processes on a shared host os.

[23:59:05] <mrfb> very few cases I do need to go inside the container to do any kind of debugging, like very very rare cases
