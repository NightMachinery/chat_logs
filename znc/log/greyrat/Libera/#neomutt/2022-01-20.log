[03:47:33] <flatcap> dcpurton: I'm wondering about renaming a bunch of the OP_COMPOSE_*
[03:47:35] <flatcap> https://gist.github.com/flatcap/eb9ed6228fb66e3589d44e216e394fab
[03:47:46] <flatcap> I've grouped them by the object they work on...
[03:48:32] <flatcap> the first bunch in compose alter the Envelope, so I'd change them to OP_ENV_*
[03:48:59] <flatcap> and the later ones that alter the attachments OP_ATTACH_*
[03:49:20] <flatcap> (they're not user-facing, so it shouldn't affect anyone)
[03:50:32] <flatcap> I'm still thinking about some of the "generic" actions, like OP_DELETE
[03:51:07] <flatcap> having a unique handler for each would mean OP_EMAIL_DELETE, OP_ATTACH_DELETE, etc
[03:55:53] <dcpurton> When I was trying to figure out how things worked, the slightly confusing thing for me was not so much the names, but where the generic ones were
[03:56:33] <dcpurton> So all the actions in the compose menu are in `compose/functions.c. Makes sense
[03:57:09] <dcpurton> But then I couldn't find the code for OP_VIEW_ATTACH, which is in `email/recvattach.c`
[03:57:32] <dcpurton> this is unexpected
[03:58:14] <dcpurton> your idea of combining things into an attachment window that deals with composing and reading would be helpful in dealing with this
[03:58:58] <dcpurton> then by all means rename them to give more hints as to how a function interacts with a message
[03:59:01] <dcpurton> or attachment
[04:00:18] <dcpurton> And I need a better IRC client
[04:00:28] <dcpurton> what should I use?
[04:01:19] <flatcap> I use weechat
[04:01:31] <flatcap> it was fairly simple to set up
[04:01:37] <dcpurton> I shall try

[13:50:14] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[13:50:21] <gahr> thoughts on #3200? 
[13:50:21] <neo-bot> Issue by @wgmayer0 "Save all attachments with a keybinding": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3200
[13:50:41] <gahr> I think the expectations are clear now.. if we want the feature, I can probably work on it a bit
[13:51:45] <gahr> I'd probably add an attach_save_auto_rename config or something to trigger renaming to avoid clashes to and to give unnamed parts a name
[13:54:06] * flatcap reads ...
[13:59:50] <flatcap> ok, that seems reasonable
[14:01:06] <gahr> a different approach would be to create an archive with all the parts
[14:01:10] <gahr> would make naming easier
[14:01:13] <gahr> perhaps..
[14:01:58] <flatcap> archive?  .tar?
[14:02:42] <gahr> yeah
[14:02:50] <gahr> I just realize we'd need to name the files anyway
[14:03:39] <flatcap> before you start, I'd check the OP's motives...
[14:04:22] <flatcap> some people have been talking about saving html email with embedded images
[14:04:46] <flatcap> if you just save all the parts, the html won't work
[14:05:19] <flatcap> by embedded, I mean separate attachments with a Content-Id
[14:05:37] <gahr> yep
[14:07:09] <flatcap> we could do with a way to help people there -- not sure what it is, though
[14:08:18] <flatcap> I suppose html is a common-enough use-case to write some specific code to handle it
[14:09:14] <flatcap> and alternative to the archive, might just be a directory, like browsers...
[14:09:34] <flatcap> blah_blah.html and blah_blah_files/
[14:10:35] <gahr> I would't love to modify emails when saving, though
[14:11:40] <flatcap> yeah, but it depends what we're saving
[14:12:03] <flatcap> if it's the entire email, then -- no changes, so signing works
[14:12:03] <gahr> I'd prefer an external script to relink the html page with its images
[14:12:32] <gahr> ok I don't have an opinion yet :)
[14:12:38] <flatcap> we'd have to tell the script which cid:xyz refers to which file
[14:12:49] <gahr> yeah
[14:13:04] <gahr> I think that'd be a different functionality
[14:13:08] <gahr> like, save-html-bundle
[14:13:18] <gahr> we could as well save everything in a file and inline the image
[14:13:22] <flatcap> yeah, definitely a specific function
[14:14:41] <flatcap> we could call <save-html-bundle> transparently for text/html when using mailcap
[14:31:56] <flatcap> I've just enabled Discussions - devel only for now - https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/discussions
[14:32:38] <flatcap> I'm going to dump a lot of my thoughts about Compose/Attach in there
[14:32:56] <flatcap> stuff that may or may not be an Issue or become a Pull Request
[14:34:53] <flatcap> gahr: if you're interested in playing along, you could start a <save-html-bundle> discussion

[15:02:05] <flatcap> dcpurton: I've been thinking about Body/TAILQ again.  Do we need the extra linking in the *Body*?
[15:02:29] <flatcap> in compose, we have the AttachPtr pointing to the Body...
[15:03:00] <flatcap> compose is the only time (I think) that manipulates the tree of Bodys
[15:03:46] <flatcap> (send_message() adds a signature (simple) or encryption (which replaces some parts), but that's relatively simple)
[15:04:55] <flatcap> so... could we keep `struct Body` as simple as possible and put the TAILQ magic in AttachPtr?
[15:17:51] <dcpurton> flatcap: it's straight forward to manipulate the array of AttachPtr structs, since you're just moving multiple items around in array
[15:19:13] <dcpurton> It does probably make sense to leave the Body set up until you're actually ready to send the email
[15:19:54] <flatcap> using a TAILQ (with bi-directional linking) and a `Body *parent` would make your life much simpler...
[15:19:59] <dcpurton> Then you can just have one function that goes through all the AttachPtrs and links the Body pointers in the right way
[15:20:42] <dcpurton> Reording the Body pointers was easily the most annoying part of the new code
[15:20:49] <flatcap> I thought that'd have to live in the Body, but I think if it were in the AttachPtr, then we'd have the complexity when we needed it, but Body would be simpler
[15:21:12] <flatcap> yeah, I can imagine
[15:21:52] <flatcap> I've been trying to work out what an Attachment API would look like
[15:22:01] <dcpurton> I spent much too much time going through the logic in my head again and again :( only to have it segfault or memory leak or just lose attachments
[15:22:17] <flatcap> :-(
[15:23:02] <flatcap> btw, I've opened Discussions on GitHub.  I'm going to start dumping my brain into them
[15:23:21] <flatcap> it'll be easier that trying to follow my ramblings on IRC :-)
[15:23:32] <dcpurton> it would be a big job redesigning things
[15:23:53] <flatcap> yeah.  I'm not sure how we'd do that
[15:24:15] <flatcap> but having a well-defined goal before we start wouldn't hurt
[15:24:26] <dcpurton> yeah
[15:26:34] <flatcap> for the API I've been trying to think of it in three layers: business logic, view objects (AttachPtr) and data objects (Body)
[15:27:59] <flatcap> I'll write up what I've come up with so far
[15:49:09] <flatcap> #3203
[15:49:15] <flatcap> neo-bot: #3203
[15:50:00] <flatcap> who knows python? :-)
[15:55:37] <gahr> flatcap: not sure I want to play with parsing html files in C :D
[15:56:53] <flatcap> I don't think we need to.  I think it's just a search and replace
[15:57:10] <flatcap> "cid:xyz" -> "images/cat.gif"
[15:58:29] <gahr> and let's hope nobody writes "cid:foo" in their email bodies
[15:58:36] <gahr> pretty hackish if you ask me
[15:59:33] <flatcap> yes :-)
[15:59:55] <flatcap> we'd be looking for an exact *quoted* string

[17:00:01] <dcpurton> I mean with the python and cid:xyz comments
[17:00:29] <flatcap> python: the neo-bot doesn't understand #3204 is a discussion
[17:01:12] <flatcap> cid:xyz, yes.  gahr and I mooted a magic <save-html-bundle> function
[17:02:11] *** Joins: rossyrg (~rossyrg@cordelia.uberspace.de)
[17:02:37] <flatcap> we didn't get into any details, though
[17:03:09] <dcpurton> It's a nice idea, but to be honest I like being able to control the HTML I get exactly
[17:03:39] <dcpurton> oh wait
[17:03:57] <dcpurton> you do mean for reading 
[17:04:14] <flatcap> yes, the recv case
[17:04:21] <dcpurton> save all the attachments in multipart/related and fix up content-id links
[17:04:46] <flatcap> yes
[17:04:49] <dcpurton> I think this shouldn't be so hard
[17:05:17] <flatcap> and we would probably do the same transparently for the text/html mailcap case
[17:05:26] <dcpurton> yeah
[17:08:33] <dcpurton> the logic is easy. Check if html is part of multipart/related, if so save additionally save out anything with a content-id header, then search and replace for the cid:.
[17:09:10] <dcpurton> You could even do a regex <img> replace
[17:09:23] <dcpurton> to avoid accidentally replacing wrong thing
[17:09:31] *** dob1_ is now known as dob1
[17:09:52] <dcpurton> I have never seen an email that uses a related group for anything other than embedded images
[17:16:03] <flatcap> <img> hmm... css? there could be other stuff
[17:16:51] <flatcap> I think anything single or double quoted matching the cid: should be fair game
[17:20:28] <gahr> if we do it, we better do it with a proper parser..
[17:21:11] <flatcap> is that what you reckon other mail programs are doing?
[17:21:24] <gahr> I think if we start adding support for tweaking html emails, we might as well depend on an html parser and to the right thing
[17:21:33] <gahr> I don't know
[17:22:02] <dcpurton> css… maybe. I would not send an email that didn't have all css inline. Support would be too unpredictable
[17:23:10] <flatcap> even an <img> tag could appear in several different forms
[17:24:06] <dcpurton> what do you mean?
[17:24:16] <gahr> my question is: why? :D
[17:24:21] <flatcap> <img> <img /> plus all the attributes inside
[17:24:46] <flatcap> hehe
[17:25:06] <flatcap> we have to accept that some neomutt users will receive html email :-)
[17:25:24] <dcpurton> I find it annoying that when previewing an html part that all the images are missing
[17:25:33] <flatcap> and in some rare cases, the images might be important :-)
[17:25:34] <gahr> the 99% of which will have https:// images
[17:25:51] <dcpurton> gahr: this is not true
[17:26:07] <dcpurton> most gui mail clients allow you simply to paste an image into the body
[17:26:11] <dcpurton> and people do this often
[17:26:39] <dcpurton> If I don't want to see the images, I look at the text/plain part
[17:26:45] <gahr> ok, I might be lucky enough not to know so many of those people :)
[17:26:48] <dcpurton> if I do want to see the images, they should appear
[17:29:04] <gahr> is that cid: thingie a standard?
[17:29:12] <dcpurton> I think so
[17:29:14] <flatcap> it's mentioned in the RFC
[17:29:31] <flatcap> not *defined* but "reserved", I think
[17:29:41] <flatcap> and mid: for a message-id
[17:29:53] <gahr> rfc2392 ?
[17:30:32] <dcpurton> my question around an HTML parser is whether it isn't just good enough to make it work in most cases. And most cases means `<img ... src="cid:..." ...>`
[17:30:57] <dcpurton> If you can produce a real email that does something different, I promise to be impressed
[17:31:52] <dcpurton> I guess you could have `src = "cid:..."`
[17:32:18] <dcpurton> or some such variation
[17:32:20] <flatcap> gahr: yes: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2392
[17:32:33] <gahr> dcpurton: tell me more about your "..."
[17:33:07] <gahr> <img>foo</img>Hey, src="cid:bar"
[17:33:08] <dcpurton> there can be other irrelevant things in an img tag (alt="…", style="…")
[17:33:13] <gahr> sure
[17:33:24] <gahr> so you start having to parse a proper tag opening/closing
[17:33:46] <flatcap> I thing the rfc said something about the "..." being in address format x@y
[17:34:09] <dcpurton> I'm using ... as ellipsis
[17:34:34] <gahr> I was referring as the .. in <img ... src
[17:35:27] <dcpurton> yeah, so you need to deal with <img alt="Alt Text" style="margin-top: 4px;" src="cid:some-id">
[17:35:34] *** Joins: bsd4me (~IceChat95@user/bsd4me)
[17:35:46] <gahr> and <img>foo</img> lol cid:"don't change me"
[17:36:09] <dcpurton> Is <img>foo</img> even valid HTML?
[17:36:10] <flatcap> but we have a definitive list of *valid* cids
[17:36:21] <dcpurton> exactly
[17:37:26] <gahr> if we start parsing html emails there are a lot of nice things we could do
[17:37:26] <dcpurton> the src="cid:…" must be somewhere within <img … >
[17:38:15] <gahr> I don't think it's very forward looking to just start doing hacky stuff to support random 1-off use cases
[17:38:34] <gahr> but sure, you can start parsing the html with strchr('<') 
[17:38:51] <dcpurton> does neomutt already use a regex library though?
[17:39:10] <gahr> for regex-able things, yes
[17:39:25] <dcpurton> surely this is an easy candidate for regex
[17:39:28] <gahr> html can't be parsed by regex
[17:39:40] <dcpurton> but you're only parsing <img …>
[17:39:50] <dcpurton> and only looking for a precise match
[17:39:55] <dcpurton> of the content-id
[17:40:03] <gahr> sure, that's the 1-off use case I'm talking about
[17:40:18] <gahr> I'm sure you can come up with code that covers 99% of the cases
[17:40:38] <gahr> I just like "correct" things bettern than I like "working" things
[17:41:47] <flatcap> covering 99% of the cases will take a few hours.  the remaining 1% -- I wouldn't like to guess
[17:41:55] <gahr> go ahead :)
[17:48:05] <dcpurton> I dunno. If you go the full parser solution, you still have to decide how much you'll support. audio? css? scripts? inline frames? whatever else the html spec allows you to embed
[17:48:15] <dcpurton> But emails just don't come with these things
[17:48:58] <dcpurton> so you just do the image option. And you still have something that mostly works, but might not in some cases
[17:49:40] <flatcap> and that doesn't prevent a better solution in the future
[17:50:26] <dcpurton> I guess
[17:52:56] <dcpurton> I'm interested in seeing this feature. And happy to do the coding. But would need help in choice of parser and how to get that connected to Neomutt's build system
[17:56:04] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[17:56:39] <flatcap> I think the parser's overkill
[17:57:05] <flatcap> but start off by figuring out how we'd implement the function
[17:58:14] <dcpurton> OK. I might fix this bug first though: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/1590
[17:58:43] <flatcap> great, thanks
[17:58:45] <dcpurton> With the new grouping code and ability to move the fundamental part it's more likely to trigger
[17:59:00] <dcpurton> Shouldn't be too hard
[17:59:06] <dcpurton> hopefully…
[17:59:22] <flatcap> :-)
[18:00:39] <dcpurton> Anyway. Bed time. And I'll let you and gahr decide whether HTML parsers are good or bad :)
