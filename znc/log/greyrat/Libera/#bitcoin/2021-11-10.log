[17:49:55] <yanmaani> FightingFalcon: It may very well happen, but if so, only by massive centralization.
[17:50:10] <FightingFalcon> So we will turn to other coins?
[17:50:25] <yanmaani> in the degenerate case: proof of stake is obviously 100% secure if a single person owns all the tokens
[17:50:41] <yanmaani> i don't know who "we" is in that sentence; nobody uses ethereum for anything serious
[17:50:46] <yanmaani> but no, people will keep using it all the same

[17:52:01] <yanmaani> no idea, i haven't mined ethereum since like 2015
[17:52:20] <yanmaani> depends on what other coins use that algo, and if there's other GPU coins
[17:52:36] <yanmaani> you can mine Monero on a GPU right? though it's not that fast
[17:53:34] <jcpham> "nobody uses ethereum for anything serious" <- there's entire distributed marketplaces creating entirely newmarkets on Eth
[17:53:41] <jcpham> difficult to take seriously

[21:36:15] <earnestly> Yes, essentially
[21:36:51] <paairs> no afaik
[21:37:18] <earnestly> You need a bitcoin daemon running

[21:44:34] <Diablo-D3> also, just wear and tear on the gpu
[21:44:38] <Guest28> Yea which makes me think LN nodes would be better?

[21:49:14] <Victorsueca> About the lightning node, IIRC Electrum can have lightning channels with SPV without downloading the entire chain, though I'm not sure if that would be safe in the event of a chain split.
[21:49:15] <Guest28> you get paid by participating?

[21:50:25] <Guest28> You mean a hard fork chain split? Why is that?

[21:51:44] <Guest28> ooh makes sense
[21:52:07] <Guest28> so therefore you are better off running a LN node that downloads the entire bitcoin blockchain
[21:54:38] <Victorsueca> Not sure, but I think electrum partially solves that by contacting electrum servers run by the community, which have a full node as a backend, but it still relies on those electrum servers being honest (i.e. not denying knowledge of a transaction that actually happened).
[21:55:01] <Guest28> right

[22:51:43] <Guest28> In LN, HTLCs are basically the process of how payment hashes of the preimage get routed along a path? And it includes a timelocks and requires signatures to prevent people from spending funds?
[22:56:06] *** Quits: bitblit (~bitblit@gateway/tor-sasl/bitblit) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[22:57:08] <_aj_> Guest28: HTLC stands for "hash timelock contract" -- the hash part allows the funds to be claimed via the preimage, the timelock part allows funds to be reclaimed after a timeout if the preimage hasn't already been presented then. each channel in a route has a htlc between the sender and the recipient
[22:58:01] <AndyS2_> If I am not mistaken, the idea is that you want to make sure that everybody along the way gets paid by their channel partner. The preimage reveal thing makes sure that you can make bitcoin script smart contracts that make it possible to enforce the payment once the recipient got his money. and because it is enforceable, nodes/channel partners have no good reason to not sign a new channel state ...
[22:58:07] <AndyS2_> ... with the funds having been transfered once the payment cleared, so you might never see a HTLC on chain for certain channel
[22:59:13] <AndyS2_> the timelock is necessary so the funds do not stay unspendable forever if the preimage is never revealed
[23:00:09] <Guest28> reclaimed meaning able to be refunded if there is a failure or time expires?
[23:00:59] *** Quits: hexteex (~hexteex@gateway/tor-sasl/hexteex) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:02:13] <AndyS2_> AFAIK you lock up a certain amount of satoshi inside an extra output within a off-chain bitcoin transaction, i.e. the amount that you want to send on to your channel partner because they are meant to pay someone else with that money, until it reaches the recipient
[23:03:31] <AndyS2_> if you funded a channel with 100000 satoshi and you create an output with 40000 that's protected by a HTLC, you only got 60000 left in total in that tx, which has to make up your remaining channel balance and that of the other person
[23:04:01] <AndyS2_> if the payment doesn't clear for some reason, you want to get that money back so you can use it for another ln tx

[23:05:16] <AndyS2_> you can safely do that after the time expires, and the other person cannot make you lose that money (not stealing it from you, just making you lose it) because they know you could go on chain and then just spend it because the timelock has expired
