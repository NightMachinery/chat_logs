[00:25:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: When covid started I tried getting groceries delivered; the only available service had appointments booked weeks in advance and was hideously overpriced and didn't have half the stuff I needed at least
[00:25:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> But hey let's try it now, why not
[00:26:22] <kuudes> I just have baseline order there for constant mondays and thursdays and edit that when needed and it is billed to my credit card when they deliver it

[00:29:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Ok well I guess it's not overbooked anymore but it's *at least* twice the price of my local greengrocer, before delivery fees
[00:30:31] <kuudes> meh
[00:30:44] <kuudes> here it is just the same stuff that is on the store on the same price
[00:31:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol tomatoes at 8 fucking dollars a pound
[00:31:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Insane
[00:31:10] <kuudes> they just pick it from the store and there is a fixed picking fee and another for delivery, something like 15 e total per delivery
[00:31:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a lot
[00:31:56] <kuudes> ~ I buy about 150 e per delivery
[00:32:20] <kuudes> you know, multiple persons
[00:32:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: The thing is that in many parts of NYC, groceries are very inexpensive. Of all living expenses here, on groceries we beat most other places I've ever been to, hands down
[00:32:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's at local greengrocers
[00:33:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> For deliver services to compete with that seems nearly impossible
[00:33:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> They'd have to partner *with* the greengrocers
[00:33:42] <kuudes> ah, specialist shops, like different shop for bread and different for milk?
[00:33:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that also seems very hard, these are tiny mom-and-pop places for the most part
[00:33:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> No no, not specialist
[00:34:05] <kuudes> hmm, ok
[00:34:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like ... ok, let me give examples
[00:35:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> FreshDirect has Russet potatoes at $1.49/lb., I get them for about half that
[00:36:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their cheapest whole chicken is $3.49/lb., I pay $1.49-$1.99 at the supermarket
[00:37:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their cheapest chicken thighs are $3.99/lb., I paid $1.19 just this week
[00:38:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their cheapest eggs are a dozen *small* eggs for $3.14, I pay $1.49 (sometimes less) for a dozen *extra-large*
[00:39:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> In other words if I bought my groceries this way, I'd be doubling-tripling my expenditures, *before* delivery fees
[00:42:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, and forget about stuff like berries, etc.; they have strawberries at $4.99/lb., whereas I just bought 4 lbs. for $2, i.e. that is fully 10x more expensive
[00:42:41] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life_ (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[00:43:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course they were on sale, but then that's the point, right? The delivery services don't have sales like that (and even without the sale the berries would be like 3-5x more)

[00:45:26] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[00:45:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Stuff like pasta is the same price
[00:45:38] <aweinstock> $0.75/lb for potatos seems a bit expensive, looking at my receipts, it's something like $2.49 for 5lbs at a store within 3 mins walking, or $2.77 for 10 lbs at a store that's a 10-15 minute drive
[00:46:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: The pre-picked bags are cheaper, yes. But I find you get inferior quality that way
[00:46:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: But anyway that just proves my point even more!
[00:46:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> $1.49/lb. is surely exorbitant
[00:47:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, so the pattern I just noted reveals another problem: it incentivizes users of such services to eat less healthy
[00:47:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> If fresh produce, raw meat, dairy, etc., is very expensive, but pasta and packaged stuff isn't ...
[00:48:04] <gwern> it makes you wonder why it's so expensive
[00:48:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Storage costs, I imagine ... transportation (they have to transport twice instead of once, right?)
[00:49:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whatever the reason, the bottom line is that this would be totally non-viable and a bad idea, for someone like me
[00:49:44] <aweinstock> presumably the delivery service isn't selecting individual potatos using the same quality heuristics you would use personally at a store, so that $1.49/lb is for the pre-bagged assortment?
[00:49:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed! Which makes it even worse!
[00:50:38] <aweinstock> yeah, it's just enough to bring it into the 8x worse range instead of merely 2x worse

[01:28:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> In "vanilla" a.k.a. original World of Warcraft, the paladin class was considered generally somewhat weak (in at least its tank and damage-dealer roles/variants). In the interminable forum / etc. discussions of this, players of paladin characters would regularly demand improvements, and one point that was often brought up by people *opposed* to such improvements was: "paladins are already balanced, because they have many 'oh
[01:28:19] <Obormot\Arcturus>  shit buttons'!" What this meant was: the paladin class had many abilities and spells designed as "emergency save the day" moves / "rapid recovery from sudden catastrophe" / etc. (things like "once per hour, instantaneously heal the tank to full health, at the cost of all of your mana points", or "once per 10 minutes, become immune to all damage for 10 seconds", or "make another character un-attackable for 3 minutes, but you
[01:28:19] <Obormot\Arcturus>  immediately die")
[01:29:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> These of course were indeed very powerful abilities, equalled by no other character class in the game, BUT empirically, they did not lead to player satisfaction with the paladin class. The reason was eventually formulated thus: "I don't want to save the party when things go catastrophically wrong; what I want is to contribute effectively to things going right"
[01:30:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And this argument, among others, convinced the WoW developers to eventually make changes to the paladin class)
[01:30:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I thought of this in the context of this essay: https://web.archive.org/web/20160602041825/http://thefutureprimaeval.net/on-saving-the-world-and-other-delusions-2/

[01:31:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Someone wants to save the world, but this ends up being a pathological desire in various ways
[01:32:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem, it seems to me, is this: ok, let's say, hypothetically, that the world was suddenly saved / the need to save it (whatever you're saving it from) suddenly removed. *Then* what would you want to do?

[01:33:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you have no idea at all - if there's really nothing that you do or would find meaningful *in a world that needs no saving* - then indeed "save the world" is inevitably going to be a pathological motivation!
[01:33:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> True meaning is of course *only* going to be found in "contributing to things going right", so to speak
[01:33:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> It can't be found *just* in "saving the world from things catastrophically going wrong"
[01:34:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I have previously made the point that EAs and similar types would do much better to think of "improving the world" than "saving the world", and I reiterate that now)
[01:38:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course the startup guy's meaning crisis described in the post also has another cause, which is that "save the world" was bullshit in the first place and of course a startup is a fundamentally nonsensical way of doing anything like that - how can you think that your startup is for saving the world when you know perfectly well that startups pivot to radically different shit the moment their existing plan proves unviable/unpr

[01:39:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But that doesn't really touch the core point, since of course EAs and non-profit people have the same fundamental problem of purpose)

[02:04:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are no 240V sockets in any apartment in my building or any similar buildings around here as far as I know

[02:06:01] * gwern skimmed the thread and it didn't really make sense to him
[02:06:09] <saturn2> you could check if any outlets in your apartment are on different phases and if so wire them together to get 240V
[02:06:43] <rmmh> saturn2: 60Hz, not 50Hz
[02:06:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have no idea how to do that and I don't think I want to get into amateur electrical wiring work like that
[02:07:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It's about kitchen cabinets and how they don't reach the ceiling
[02:07:03] <rmmh> frequency _might_ not matter for the motor
[02:07:34] <saturn2> given how sturdy it's supposed to be, running 20% faster is probably fine
[02:07:44] <gwern> yes, but why does it matter when ceilings are so tall anyway? I live somewhere with very low ceilings and am much taller than the average women and I still struggle to use my top-tier cabinets which 'go to the ceiling'
[02:07:45] <rmmh> why would this hand mixer be any sturdier than any other hand mixer
[02:07:52] <rmmh> the thing that breaks in kitchenaid mixers are the gearing
[02:07:55] <ggreer> eh most stuff will work fine at different hertz. maybe it'll spin a little faster or whatever
[02:07:58] <rmmh> this doesn't have gearing
[02:08:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: ... did you not read the link I posted
[02:08:15] <rmmh> the translate.goog one?
[02:08:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: This is literally like the sturdiest hand mixer ever and routinely lasts for decades
[02:08:51] <ggreer> cabinets to the ceiling just look weird unless you live in a hobbit hole
[02:09:17] <ggreer> and yeah they're kinda useless unless you're super tall or you keep a stepladder in your kitchen

[02:10:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that doesn't do anything about the frequency, right
[02:10:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[02:11:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> It says "frequency: 50HZ/60HZ", does that just mean it's compatible with power of either frequency
[02:11:21] <saturn2> i wouldn't worry about the frequency
[02:11:36] <saturn2> yes probably
[02:11:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There are other factors involved when using devices on different power systems - notably the fact your device is expecting 240v 50hz AC and this Step-up transformer will be providing 240v 60hz AC (when run in the USA power system). This 10hz difference in the frequency actually equates to a 17% inefficiency in any internal transformers in your device, this means if your device states it uses 240v AC @ 100W - it will probably
[02:11:48] <Obormot\Arcturus>  actually be consuming 117W and probably getting warmer than normal. Transformers are 'tuned' to a certain line frequency, running them 'out of tune' is usually ok, they will just get a little warmer, and they will be a little less efficient, consuming more power." hm
[02:12:06] <ggreer> it's ancient analog equipment. running it 20% faster won't matter. the duty cycle on a mixer isn't insane

[02:23:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh that sounds unlikely

[02:35:39] <gwern> what an obormot thing to buy :)
[02:36:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I got the set with the various attachments and the immersion blender stick and the blender and some sort of instruction manual etc.
[02:36:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Should be here in late April (shipping from the U.K.)
[02:37:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (See, what did I say? Communism produced some great stuff!)
[02:37:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Has capitalism given us a mixer like this? IT HAS NOT)
[02:37:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> (CHECKMATE RANDTHEISTS)
[02:38:08] <adiabatic> how much did it cost back then
[02:39:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dunno. Cost me over $200 now though
[02:40:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Back then you probably had to put your name on a list to be dispensed one (1) mixer at an unspecified time in the future
[02:40:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Nah j/k I don't think the GDR had that sort of problem)
[02:41:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Indeed in Russia we always viewed products from there as, like, Quality Foreign Imports that were better than shitty merely Soviet goods)
[02:41:31] <saturn2> if you can still buy them on ebay they must not have been super rare
[02:41:55] <gwern> the de WP says like 18 million made, iirc
[02:42:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also to be clear like 40% of the cost I just quoted is shipping)
[02:42:04] <gwern> and if they are durable as they are supposed to be...
[02:42:50] <ggreer> auction sites have lots of rare stuff. if a million of something were made 50 years ago, you'll always have a few available due to estate sales and whatnot

[02:50:49] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: hm. *was* it ukrainian? like, I'd assume linen or whatever would've been grown in the ukraine mostly for the ussr
[02:51:21] <gwern> you're not growing vast fields of flax in siberia, one assumes
[02:55:02] <kuudes> kazakstan seems to be a big source currently
[02:55:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Perhaps, perhaps not. Plenty of textile factories in Russia...
[02:55:07] <kuudes> so central asia?
[02:55:15] <kuudes> aral sea area?
[02:55:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Of the sheets I got before, one had a tag still attached, and that one was made in Russia
[02:55:24] <kuudes> cotton was put there, wasn't it
[02:55:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Yes, these are linen sheets though - flax, not cotton
[02:56:03] <gwern> ah. so maybe ukrainian flax but still 'russian linen'. way something has egyptian cotton but isn't egyptian textile
[02:56:47] <kuudes> yeah, flax is grown at least in kazakstan
[02:56:56] <kuudes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flax#Production
[02:56:57] <Robomot> Flax - Wikipedia [Production] (In 2018, world production of flax (linseed) was 3.2 million tonnes, led by Kazakhstan with 29% of the total.[47] Other major producers were Canada, Russia, and China (table).)
[02:57:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I mean, who knows, maybe *this* one bedsheet was made in Ukraine. It's not impossible! Many factories there too. (My silverware was made in a Ukrainian housewares factory, e.g.) I'm just saying, that before, this shit was all branded "Soviet" / "Russian"
[02:57:22] <kuudes> unsure if ukraine would have that, I think the ground is different there

[03:00:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I cold-brewed black tea, and put the jar in the back of my fridge (where the temp is lowest)
[03:00:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> It froze, making that pattern
[03:00:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The dark part is further from the refrigerator's back wall, i.e. furthest from the cold source)
[03:01:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interestingly, I also cold-brewed an identical jar of green tea at the same time, which has *not* frozen

[03:02:21] <gwern> conclusion - if you're cold, drink green tea. it contains the warmth and essence of spring
[03:03:17] <Obormot\Gaia> Oh huh, on closer inspection I think that dark part is *still liquid*
[03:03:22] <Obormot\Gaia> And therefore concentrated
[03:03:23] <Obormot\Gaia> Black tea
[03:04:50] <saturn2> i didn't know you could freeze distill tea
[03:05:33] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: have you heard of hazelnut/oat crusts?
[03:06:04] <gwern> (I'm not sure you can 'freeze-distill' tea per se. I wouldn't expect the water-soluble tea to act like alcohol - how much of the solutes are in the ice now?)
[03:06:25] * gwern wonders if the caffeine is primarily in the ice now
[03:06:33] <Obormot\Gaia> Confirmed, it was liquid, that whole dark thing. I have now extracted it. It is very strong
[03:06:43] <Obormot\Gaia> adiabatic: Nope?
[03:06:56] <Obormot\Gaia> (Well, at least it's very bitter. Hm.)
[03:07:10] <adiabatic> want me to rewind to that point in Nadiya Bakes, Episode 2, on Netflix?
[03:07:21] <Obormot\Gaia> adiabatic: I'll google it
[03:09:32] * Obormot\Gaia moves the jar of green tea slightly to where the black tea was. Maybe the same thing will happen after all

[04:16:34] <quanticle> Yeah, I suppose it's like cars from the '50s.
[04:16:51] <adiabatic> or maybe it was about as good as anything else from that time, but they're only being discovered now
[04:17:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Well, neither West Germany nor America seem to have made an RG28 mixer or its like, so...
[04:17:54] <gwern> the challenge kennedy should've issued
[04:18:13] <gwern> 'before this decade is out, manufacture a handheld mixer that will put an ordinary american (wo)man over the moon'
[04:18:32] <quanticle> gwern: Kennedy was interested in issuing challenges that the US could actually win
[04:20:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: But you know, I think you're subtly wrong there. Set mixers aside for the moment, since I never lived in the GDR, but consider bedsheets. In Soviet Russia we certainly craved plenty of products from the Warsaw Pact states (we had no access to stuff beyond that nor any idea of what it was like, so no desire for it), as in many categories Bulgarian, Hungarian, Czech, German, etc. stuff was better than ours. But
[04:20:07] <Obormot\Arcturus>  *bedsheets were not among that*
[04:20:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nor, say... forks
[04:20:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yes, today Soviet bedsheets and Soviet forks are still desirable, because they were desirable back then too!
[04:21:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not Soviet blouses, or Soviet computers, or Soviet cars...
[04:22:09] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm looking at this mythical RG28 (https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/east-german-gdr-food-mixer-set-aka-220439357) and I have to say I'm unimpressed. Yes, it looks like it's more solidly constructed than today's made-in-China junk. But does it seem more impressive than my mom's old Oster blender? Not really.

Possibly designed by Kurt Boeser. Comprises hand mixer ...from)
[04:22:44] <gwern> hm, soviet computers sound kinda collectible
[04:22:47] <quanticle> It's somewhat yellowed example of an appliance from back when appliances were actually durable
[04:22:55] <gwern> after all, they meet the first condition of being a collectible: not many of them
[04:22:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> But Soviet tools, for instance - yes. I've mentioned, I think, the time when I had some furniture delivered, which was to be assembled upon delivery; and the workmen whou brought it were Russian. So one of them suddenly realizes they forgot to bring longnose pliers - turns to me - "do you have...?" "sure" I bring him my pliers
[04:23:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> And he's like "Ah! The good Soviet kind! *Excellent*"
[04:23:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Did you read internaut's review of it, on DSL?
[04:23:34] <quanticle> Oh, no.
[04:23:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> And all the links I posted about it
[04:23:44] <quanticle> I don't follow the DSL front page.
[04:23:55] <quanticle> No, I just scrolled up to where you found it on eBay 
[04:24:01] <quanticle> And read down from there
[04:24:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, well, scroll up from there, I linked stuff about how it lasts for 40+ years etc.
[04:25:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Collectible, of course, is not at all the same as "desirable for actual use", much less "dramatically superior to currently available products"
[04:26:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I've heard claims that this yellowing [of plastic made after a certain date] is due to breakdowns in flame-retardant additives in the plastic; not sure how well-founded the claim is, but it would explain why your old machine doesn't have the problem.  In any event, collectors of late 70s-early 80s era personal computers like the TRS-80/Commodore/etc. have come up with a process for reversing the effect: https://retr0bright.co
[04:26:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> m/ has the details."
[04:28:19] <quanticle> Yeah, it's possible to rewhiten the plastic, but, I would caution that it might reduce the strength of the plastic.
[04:28:35] <quanticle> If the yellowing doesn't bother you, I'd say leave it be.
[04:28:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, by no means does it bother me

[07:48:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Now, it’s true that any LARP sustained long enough eventually becomes real. The Netherlands for instance was once German, and there’s even a parallel there with how Dutch consistently looks and sounds worse than German. So an independent Ukraine could, over time, become a real country. But to what end? Do we really need another mediocre Slavic country? It reminds me of Latin America, where you have dozens of barely
[07:48:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  distinguishable nonentity countries serving no real purpose. The entire region should be consolidated into maybe five states at most. Russia, Poland, and Serbia are the only Slavic states needed by the world."
[07:49:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This and preceding are apparently from a commenter on Anatoliy Karlin's blog)
[07:49:24] <quanticle> The Netherlands were Germany? I thought they gained independence from the Spanish
[07:49:27] <PapuaHardyNet> "Do we really need another mediocre Slavic country?" lmao
[07:51:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> But is he wrong though???
[07:51:20] <quanticle> That said, he says that Poland should be a country and Ukraine shouldn't be? Come the fuck on, Poland is even less of a real country than Ukraine is.
[07:51:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ehhh

It is a compound of rzecz "thing, matter" and pospolita "common," a calque of Latin res publica, i.e. republic, in English also rendered as commonwealth (historic) and republic (current).

[07:56:28] <quanticle> Doesn't Poland as a state also predate Russia as a state?
[07:56:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I find all of this unsatisfying. It’s like we’re debating whether a certain region has enough history and culture to “deserve” independence.

[07:57:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> By about a century, I think

[07:58:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[07:59:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think the world can tolerate at least two, possibly as many as three, Slavic countries
[07:59:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Russia, of course. Poland, yes. And... yeah, Serbia seems like a reasonable third one?
[07:59:42] <quanticle> Anyway, this whole post is kinda dumb. From the US perspective, Russia wants to expand and it's not in the US's interests to let Russia expand, therefore we arm Ukraine to resist Russia. Just like we armed the Afghans. We don't need any further justifications beyond that.
[08:00:10] <quanticle> In areas where we don't care (i.e. Syria) we let Russia do what it wants
[08:00:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "As best I can tell, international law on this question centers around a UN-backed covenant which says that “all peoples have the right to self-determination”." ... but who the hell cares, Scott

[08:01:04] <quanticle> In fact, didn't we already settle this debate yesterday, when I posted that quote about international system being fundamentally anarchic?
[08:01:17] <quanticle> Law is meaningless in a condition of anarchy
[08:02:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[08:03:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Realistically “people” (like “obscenity” and everything else) are a kind of know-it-when-you-see-it combination of all these factors. I hate this. It means any would-be conqueror can say “come on, this place I want to conquer isn’t a real ‘people’” - and then you need to litigate annoying questions about exactly how glorious a history they had, and which version of Civilization they appeared in, in order to
[08:03:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  prove him wrong." ... THIS IS NOT HOW ANYTHING WORKS
[08:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "None of these big problems are the enormous problem, which is that international law isn’t really enforced, and existing countries have no incentive to change a rule which favors them, so this will definitely never happen. It’s almost a category error to even talk about it, as if there were some International Congress that made International Laws that the International Police would enforce." ... yes, indeed, so therefore
[08:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus>  ....
[08:04:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Still, I think it’s useful to have an opinion on this. My opinion is that I’m in favor of the right of self-determination for any region big enough that it’s not inherently ridiculous for them to be their own country. I don’t care if they have their own language or ethnicity or glorious history, I will vote ‘yes’ before I even hear about any of those things. That means I don’t have to care about Putin’s
[08:04:47] <Obormot\Arcturus>  argument for why he should get to have Ukraine." ... no. Scott no.

[08:09:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Again, I have trouble thinking of an ethical principle that says a group of people who really want to be part of Country A should in fact have to be part of Country B instead. I can disagree with Russia’s decision to force the matter with an invasion, and I can excuse Ukraine for not worrying about it too much. But overall I think I’m stuck consistently applying the principle “please let regions leave your country if
[08:09:23] <Obormot\Arcturus>  you want”." ... so, is Scott going to follow this reasoning to its obvious conclusion about *American* history

I say it tempts rather convinces because it suggests a moral duty to conquer any country doing

Assuming we’re against invading foreign countries on principle, a utilitarian might refuse to let the Confederacy leave in the hope of preventing the establishment of a permanent slave power.

[14:10:47] <gurkenglas> i wonder if you could get a picture of citizen opinion about the annexation less distorted by "what if this is a loyalty test" if you do some small, comprehensible cryptography trick. like "pick a random number 1-10. is it 4 AND you like the new government?"
[14:12:18] <mjr> Apparently, for instance, they had a legacy soviet base at Crimea.
[14:12:27] <mjr> But I dunno the details.
[14:12:30] <gurkenglas> that's a casus belli, not a reason
[14:13:42] <saturn2> their main naval base is there and also there's oil there
[14:15:03] <gurkenglas> had ukraine considered selling crimea to russia? or is that political suicide
[14:16:46] <saturn2> none of russia's black sea coast is as good for building a port - you need a steep decline so there's deep water close to the land
[14:17:37] <gurkenglas> surely you can dig an underwater canal easy
[14:19:09] <gurkenglas> use an anchor with a broad head and a short chain, drive a ship back and forth to drag some seafloor around, right?
[14:20:28] <gurkenglas> maybe it's easy for the enemy to collapse such an excavation?
[14:21:57] <saturn2> it's not just sand all the way down, there are rocks

[14:53:54] <gurkenglas> is there a cryptographic voting technique as comprehensible to the layman as this? the techniques i quickly find aren't. (the additional feature i'd like beyond polling is "a voter can later check and/or prove that his vote was falsified")

[15:05:33] <quanticle> If you have a sheltered place where ships can dock, and that place is attached to a country that you want to trade with, you're going to end up with a port.
[15:06:28] <gurkenglas> quanticle: then if the northern Russian port froze over and crimea sank into the black sea, do you expect that Russia would find a way to build a Black Sea port?
[15:06:47] <quanticle> dTal: It's not tautological. There's a reason that you see so many cities along rivers, for example. Rivers, and especially places where rivers meet, form natural trade hubs and that's where cities tend to arise.
[15:07:06] <quanticle> gurkenglas: Crimea isn't going to sink into the Black Sea, though
[15:07:18] <quanticle> Not even in the worst case global warming scenarios
[15:07:21] <gurkenglas> that is completely orthogonal to my question :P
[15:07:33] <quanticle> Your question is a stupid hypothetical. 
[15:08:03] <quanticle> It's like, "Assume ports are arbitrary points on a perfectly frictionless sphere."
[15:08:08] <gurkenglas> is it still stupid if i say "if crimea poofed away in a cloud of logic"?
[15:08:12] <quanticle> Yes
[15:08:56] <gurkenglas> find how about "if Russia lost the war so badly that Crimea goes back to Ukraine, and Ukraine doesn't let them use that port anymore"
[15:09:02] <gurkenglas> s/find/fine/
[15:09:07] <quanticle> Crimea isn't going to poof away in a puff of logic. The Crimean peninsula is there. It used to be Russian. Russia wanted it back. It had the political and military means to do so. Ukraine did not have the political and military means to hold on to Crimea. So Russia took it.
[15:09:47] <quanticle> gurkenglas: In that case, I expect that Russia would invest in more icebreakers, and import more through St. Petersburg.
[15:10:37] <quanticle> But there's a significant minority possibility that they'd use a nuclear weapon rather than lose the port.
[15:10:51] <gurkenglas> Makes sense. Why don't you like to entertain impossible hypotheticals? I think it's useful for learning about a world model.
[15:11:09] <quanticle> Remember, even when the area was nominally Ukrainian, the port itself was still owned by Russia
[15:12:01] <quanticle> In this case, the impossible hypothetical doesn't actually meaningfully inform you about the world. It's not like physics, where constructing a model of the world minus friction and air resistance allows you to approximate the behavior of a system that exists in a world that has friction and air resistance.
[15:12:27] <quanticle> All models are wrong. Some models are useful. Yours isn't one of them.

[15:16:08] <dTal> oh that's a nice naming scheme, if a bit demanding
[15:17:07] <dTal> I variously use contemporary artists, and the old standby of mythological figures

[15:18:54] <dTal> unfortunately I've run out of headroom, as it were, on that particular naming scheme - if I get the next gen ryzen what on earth do I call it?
[15:19:17] <quanticle> Actually, given that one of my computers is sitting in a closet and hasn't booted in a year, I think it's more accurate to say that I have three computers.
[15:20:30] <synthmeat> i don't think i have many machines. i have exactly the amount of machines one should have!

Russian decision-making 3. how made-of-gears your model is. how possible a hypothetical is, seems in general only weakly related to how useful it is! a possible hypothetical lets you cache the answer in anticipation of the hypothetical coming up, but every hypothetical 
[15:20:40] <gurkenglas> lets you cache the answer in anticipation of a situation that partially matches the hypothetical coming up! I hope I'm not causing frustration and if continuing this line of inquiry will burn all the patience you have with me I wish for a warning.

That’s equivalent to the U.S. accepting 20 million refugees – about 200x what the U.S. was annually accepting before Trump. 4. During earlier refugee crises, the go-to reason to exclude was, “We just can’t take any
[22:36:44] <feepbot> more.” The Ukrainian exodus exposes this rhetoric as nonsense. The real story is: “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” If a middle-income country wants to increase its population by 6% in three weeks, it can. That’s hard fact; “We’re stretched to the breaking point” is just the diction of Social Desirability Bias. “We can’t take more refugees” is

[22:50:34] <kuudes> today the amount of ukrainian refugees exceeded 4 million, so over 10% of the country's population
[22:51:04] <kuudes> if everyone from there left, 41M persons, that would increase EU's population of 450M by about 1/11
[22:51:53] <kuudes> so even if they would be dispersed by the current population as key, that would still increase the population of each city and town in E by 9%
[22:51:57] <kuudes> *EU
[22:53:09] <kuudes> even currently we could indeed get 0.9% population increase the lowest
[22:54:49] <kuudes> I am unsure if we actually have housing for +10% people or can construct such
[22:55:10] <kuudes> I guess current people would be required to live more densely?
[22:56:43] <kuudes> then there are people fleeing from russia, though there seem likely to be much fewer of them. some number floated said 200k persons had exited russia some 2-3 weeks ago, so maybe 400k now?
[22:59:07] <gwern> can they get into the EU?
[23:01:52] <kuudes> yes
[23:02:03] <kuudes> ukrainians have visa free travel, same as americans
[23:02:15] <kuudes> so they can stay at schengen 3 months out of any 6
[23:02:29] <kuudes> also currently EU decided to enable secondary protection for them
[23:02:51] <kuudes> which means they have right of temporary residence for 1 years after applying
[23:03:01] <kuudes> which may be extended if the war continues
