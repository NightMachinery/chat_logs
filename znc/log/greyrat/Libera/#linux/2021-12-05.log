[02:16:22] <tm512> if the tearing persists at 1080p but the lagging stops, then I think the tearing might be caused by not running a compositor (or not having one configured properly), and my assumption would be that the lag in that case is due to load while running at 4K

[02:20:20] <tm512> I've heard about dwl but iirc I read something about it not supporting xwayland or something? I can't remember the details
[02:20:34] <MrElendig> based on wlroots
[02:20:59] <MrElendig> of course that makes the "config" a lot larger though.....
[02:21:31] * MrElendig would rather find a different wm with a similar behaviour but an actual config instead of "just hack the C code"

[04:14:52] <bruda> I also remember JACK. That was kinda fun. Plug one app into another. Record sound from your browser or such. But it was years ago when I played with that.
[04:15:07] <katp32> all the currently supported firefox versions (including ESRs) do not support ALSA except with apulse, which does not work very well with many applications, firefox being one of them
[04:15:23] <rascul> tm512 you are, if you have audio with firefox
[04:15:25] <katp32> 93 has no native ALSA support, only apulse and I think some patches

[04:16:52] <katp32> rascul: pulseaudio doesn't exist without ALSA so that's kind of a given, but no, firefox doesn't require libpulse, it also natively supports JACK if you compile from source

[04:23:52] <rascul> which satisfies firefox requirements
[04:23:52] <katp32> tm512: it's because firefox uses the audio subsystem for timing events, and unlike pulseaudio, ALSA doesn't guarantee that the application's timing requests will be respected, so the timing events it gets aren't exactly what firefox expects and it either drops frames or breaks entirely as a result

[06:26:15] <tm512> I don't get the push for static linking either. the main benefit I can see is that it can maybe simplify program distribution since you can just provide the binary and it'll run on anything, but it's not like that's all that difficult with dynamic linking, especially considering stuff like flatpak or appimage are an option now

[06:26:45] <bruda> Static linking is definitely larger footprint either way. Because it lumps the libraries into the binaries.
[06:27:09] <bruda> Each program that uses said library has it's own copy of it.
[06:27:12] <tm512> I don't see how dynamic linking doesn't have a smaller footprint, both on storage and when residing in memory

[06:28:06] <Karlton> only the functions used get linked in the binary
[06:28:16] <bruda> That sounds like dynamic linking.
[06:28:39] <knotMez> Karlton what besides functions are in libraries?
[06:28:43] <Karlton> dynmically links at runtime and each binrary needs to contain a lookup table

[09:38:17] <sysRPL> i am using ffmpeg to create a video capture of my desktop through a usb capture box on another linux pc, effectively offloading video capture from my main linux computer to another linux computer

[09:59:59] <sheep> dd only makes sense if you're copying between devices that have exactly the same size
[10:00:06] <ayecee> wrong
[10:00:07] <theos> would cp work? how would i make the partition bootable? install bootloader? would i need to edit the grub menu?
[10:00:09] <sheep> dd also copies unallocated space

[10:05:06] <theos> old hdd is bigger. it was 500GB. ssd is 480GB.
[10:05:28] <ayecee> then you can't use dd for this, at least, not without shrinking the partitions before the transfer.
[10:05:53] <Karlton> recreating the partition table/filesystems and rsyncing the files over is the safest option
[10:06:07] <theos> i just need to clone the 20GB partition which has the fs. the remaining partitions are swaps and storage

[10:29:47] <Karlton> that's why cp is faster, it automatically finds the fastest block size

[10:31:02] <skuldafn> so cp is really the king?

[10:31:42] <skuldafn> dd isn't that slow imho but I mean if cp is better then

[12:57:22] <greenbagels> is it easy to explain / find documentation for?

[12:58:08] <WickedDekciw> bn_work He doesn't need to when he literally has the for-profit copy of Wikipedia's business model under his belt. For the record, it isn't a negative thing, but just saying..
[12:58:12] <ayecee> greenbagels: does it cause a problem for you, or did you find it by chance?
[12:58:48] <greenbagels> ayecee: i'm trying to use a programming language's C bindings, and i think they expect all actual .so files to end in .so; i'll first look to see if there's a way to change this
[12:58:55] <bn_work> maxzor: what aspect of the markup is foul to you?  perhaps suggest improvements over in #wikipedia? :)
[12:59:03] <greenbagels> before messing with files that were packaged this way on purpose
[12:59:43] <ayecee> greenbagels: normally the .so files are symlinks
[12:59:58] <ayecee> i think
[12:59:58] <maxzor> bn_work, they have broken the syntax many times without sanitizing the existing corpus, in the corpus are now several iterations of the language, and only the in-house parser manages to find some sense into it
[13:00:13] <greenbagels> ayecee: right, to the specific versioned files
[13:00:18] <greenbagels> i think a symlink would still be fine
[13:00:27] <xiaomiao> bn_work: I've worked with MW before, it's ... uh ... random. e.g. results get truncated, and error messages are transported as literal strings
[13:00:32] <greenbagels> just confused why it's a text file
[13:00:47] <maxzor> I am afraid I am not competent enough to sugges improvements :/ other than have the wikipedia parser export all the content in plain text and start over or something :)
[13:00:58] <xiaomiao> maxzor: one of the problems I had with SMW, can't upgrade, and upstream can't even figure out why errors happen
[13:01:15] <xiaomiao> if I had to build a wiki I'd aim at markdown or similar in git

[13:10:04] <digdilem> Dual booting is the worst of both worlds imo. It's so much faff to switch that you end up using one of the other
[13:10:15] <digdilem> one or the other *
[13:10:38] <DarkSky> yeah thats what i mean
[13:10:47] <DarkSky> thats why i was asking if theres any other ways xd
[13:11:12] <Sauvin> With recent versions of Windows, as I understand it,  you can run a full Linux in Windows' WSL.
[13:11:27] <digdilem> DarkSky, hyper-v is windows' included virtual machine provider. It's fast, integrated and free (if you have the right version of windows). If you don't, then virtualbox is okay.

[20:37:28] <msiism> Sauvin: You're probably used to "salvation thorugh suffering" (Thompson & Ritchie) by now.
[20:37:31] <ddevault> I do think that non-experts can get productive use out of Linux et al, after all, Unix was designed for non-experts
[20:37:31] <Sauvin> Seems to me a reasonably good explainer could make a reasonably intelligent Joe Sixpack get good use out of Ubuntu out of the box, though. Just needs a little tutoring.
[20:37:54] <ddevault> but Linux would frustrate anyone trained to use Windows or macOS
[20:38:11] <msiism> Unix was designed for non-experts?
[20:38:19] <Sauvin> Contrast this to Windows, where the same thing could be said but you have to remember thousands of drop-down menus or pop-up dialog boxes with gazillions of checkboxkes, radio buttons, sliders, knobs and suchlike.
[20:38:42] <ddevault> msiism: 'twas
[20:38:43] <Sauvin> It took quite a while to learn how to use Windows, too. We just don't remember the learning process.
[20:38:57] <ddevault> or rather, it was designed for non-programmers
[20:39:19] <Sauvin> Programming with text, programming with a pile of mouse clicks. What's the real difference?

[22:08:45] <Wafficus> it was just annoying since I'm trying different OS's on the emulation device, and 'The Retro Arena' forced that card to format as FAT32, so '351Elec' did NOT like that and gave me a message to reformat the card --> Aka I copied my ROMs to my local computer's drive, and then reformatted the SD card as ext4, etc

[22:53:18] <hexnewbie> Sauvin: scp has another issue, where a malicious remote can change the filename, and clobber other files of your. I don't recall the exact case, and was ‘scp h1.example.com:/file.txt ./’ a problem or not. Which is why I use 'tar' - exact same issue, but it's obvious if you know how to use tar.

[22:57:38] <hexnewbie> The real advantage of tar (given it requires the same care as 'scp', and way more care than sftp or rsync), is that it's really fast when transferring a whole lot of small files. All the other protocols need to send back and forth calls over the network for each file, where with 'tar' those happen locally, and you receive a continuous stream of data.
[22:58:04] <hexnewbie> er, rsync also works for that, but not across two remotes
