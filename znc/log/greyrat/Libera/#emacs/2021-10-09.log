[09:38:08] <lisp123> > An indication of the test pressure in terms of water depth does not mean a water-resistant watch was designed for repeated long-term use in such water depths. For example, a watch marked 30 metres water resistant cannot be expected to withstand activity for longer time periods in a swimming pool, let alone continue to function at 30 metres under water. This is because the test is conducted only once using static pressure on a sample of newly ma
[09:38:09] <lisp123> nufactured watches. As only a small sample is tested there is likelihood that any individual watch is not water resistant to the certified depth or even at all.

[11:20:39] <wasamasa> yes
[11:20:48] <bpalmer> where does it write the data?
[11:20:55] <wasamasa> on top of that undo history is stored in a tree with timestamps
[11:21:00] <wasamasa> into a file, duh
[11:21:27] <bpalmer> so you have a hidden file that just grows without bounds?
[11:21:33] <wasamasa> with the right option set, it updates that undo file after each file save operation
[11:21:37] <wasamasa> yup
[11:22:28] <wasamasa> well, actually, there is one customizable option
[11:22:49] <wasamasa> 'undolevels' defaults to 1000 on common operating systems, allowing 1000 undos
[11:22:57] <wasamasa> which is plenty

[11:24:04] <wasamasa> like, who the fuck thought it to be a good idea to specify several undo limits in terms of bytes
[11:24:09] <bpalmer> bob_x1: a mode to interact with directories ("director editor" mode or suchlike). You can try it out with C-x d

[11:26:12] <bpalmer> if ~160k bytes for undo-limit is a problem, surely the problem would go away if it were just 1 MB . Or 10 MB
[11:26:14] <wasamasa> so if I have an edit that pushes the total undo history beyond 160k, all previous edits are forgotten and I'm left with that one
[11:26:19] <wasamasa> no, it wouldn't
[11:26:27] <wasamasa> the problem is that it does a hard cut at that point
[11:26:40] <wasamasa> if it would only forget one or two edits, that would be fine
[11:26:51] <wasamasa> but it forgets everything preceding the problematic one that pushed it over the edge
[11:26:54] <bpalmer> oh. OK, I can see that as ugly. It's not actually how I interpreted it, but that's a more sensible way to interpret the wording than what I had.

[19:03:39] <mathsboy> Hi everyone... I'm trying to make a little helper function to evaluate some code blocks from an org file. the process is to grab the filenname from :tangle in the header, then run my compiler on that file "run /dir/to/file". I then need to get the output and append it as a string to another shell function, and optionally add another compiled string after that. I think I can do the shell parts fine, but I'm a bit stuck on how to write 
[19:03:39] <mathsboy> function that grabs the relevant context around point in an org file. I've tried looking at the source docs for how org babel does it, but I'm a bit lost, and really keen to learn properly so happy to start with something a lot more basic. Any advice, general or specific, would be really apreciated. Cheers

[19:50:07] <artefact> i'm considering hijacking the command being run, appending && emacsclient -e "(delete-window ...)" but there must be something more elegant
[19:51:03] <YoungPotato> wgreenhouse: Thank you for your help. I changed the line to # -*- mode: Org; eval: (flyspell-mode -1) -*- # and # -*- mode: Org; eval: (flyspell-mode -1); -*- #, but in both instances, a spell check was still performed during opening the file (same as before). What happens is that when I open the file, in the minibuffer it reads 'Spell Checking...xx%', where xx goes from 0 to 100 before the file is loaded. Once opened, there is no spell
[19:51:03] <YoungPotato> checking available (e.g., errors are not being underlined). So, I was wondering if the local variable line should also prevent the spell check upon opening, and, if not, how I can do that.
[19:52:20] <wgreenhouse> YoungPotato: hmm. is there something else (for example in `text-mode-hook` or `org-mode-hook`) that is independently triggering a one-shot spell check?
[19:52:50] <wgreenhouse> that doesn't sound like flyspell at all, more like running M-x ispell one time

[20:16:45] <YoungPotato> wgreenhouse: Thanks, it was indeed a hook I had put in place to do a check upon opening an org file. However, I had wrongly assumed this hook would also not run because of the local variable, since the hook was: (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'flyspell-buffer). I'd still like to perform flyspell-buffer on most org files upon opening, except in some instances. Is it possible to not run the hook using a local variable?

[21:21:33] <hodapp> I use Jupyter a lot despite wishing I had something better...
[21:21:35] <fsmunoz> THis for the SAS stuff (since I joined 1 month ago); the resto fo my repos are around analysing votes of national parties and deriving clusters and proximity based on that, and I used Jupyter directly for those.

[21:48:01] <dansa> But Robert Chassell doesn't quite teach programming per se.  One way to really get comfortable with Emacs is to really study Lisp in the first place.  There is no better job in that than HtDP --- htdp.org.  But this will not be a quick read if you don't already have the knowledge.  (Plan to keep working on it for longer than a few months.  No rush, therefore.)
[21:49:51] <dansa> The Microsoft-approach to using computers is pretty misleading.  If it appears easy, you've been bamboozled by it.  Each software is a programming language.  Read a book on it.

[22:22:10] <dansa> greyrat: racket-mode.com is pretty nice
[22:22:24] <dansa> Racket is very elegant
[22:22:28] <dansa> I like it.
[22:23:58] <dansa> But I think Scheme, Clojure, ... These are great.
[22:24:22] <dansa> Clojure is great because of all the Java baggage.
[22:24:24] <greyrat> mathsboy: (Now imagine if emacs was written in CL, with proper parallelism ... Instead our civlization gave us VSCode. Written in JS. Configured by JSON. Loved by the "people.")
[22:25:36] <dansa> But I kinda think that when someone doesn't wrap a Clojure package around the Java package, it becomes much harder to use it.  Java doesn't encourage functional programming.  But it's great that you can use it if you have to.  You don't need to use some kind of FFI, for example.

[22:25:58] <dansa> Let me share a true story.
[22:26:02] <edrx> dansa: can I first ask you for help on something very basic on scheme? how do I define functions "square" and "cube" in racket and print them - as functions - and then print the results of square(5) and cube(b)? I'd like to port this test to scheme... http://angg.twu.net/IMAGES/2021-square-cube-3.png
[22:27:20] <greyrat> dansa: Have you checked out CL? I was scared off it at first, and thought it was an old, dead lang. It turned out to be pretty much the best Lisp I have seen. (And like emacs itself, this despite it having very many rough edges and bad, non-modern design decisions.)
[22:27:55] <dansa> In Racket, one way would be be (define (square x) (* x x)) (define (cube x) (* x x x)) and you can print these values as (displayln square) (displayln cube) (displayln (square 2)) (displayln (cube 2))
[22:28:59] <dansa> Common Lisp is great.  It was frustrating to use its web server on Windows, though, with SBCL.  It seemed it didn't work, perhaps due a well-known problem.  This gives you a sense of a disorganized community.  That's not the Racket case, for example.

[22:30:45] <dansa> I don't now LW.
[22:31:03] <dansa> Notice I said CL was great.  <dansa> Common Lisp is great.  
[22:31:08] <fourier`> yes it is commercial. But you can try their Personal version which has some limitations for free
[22:31:30] <dansa> That doesn't seem like an implementation with a future really.
[22:31:37] <greyrat> What use does this version have over SBCL, for unix users?
[22:31:40] <dansa> A language is necessarily a people's thing.

[22:32:20] <greyrat> dansa: Have you tried ABCL (CL in Java)? It should work on Windows.
[22:32:33] <dansa> That's very interesting.  No.  Now it's too late.
[22:32:36] <fourier`> LW been around for many years and not going to disappear soon. 
[22:32:39] <dansa> I have been writing Racket for years now.
[22:32:48] <greyrat> I wonder if ABCL is faster than Clojure.
[22:32:49] <dansa> It's not about appearing or disappearing.
[22:32:55] <fourier`> I had success with ClozureCL on Windows as well

[22:35:54] <dansa> The original name is really GNU EMACS.
[22:36:06] <dansa> It's a recent thing to write it as GNU Emacs.
