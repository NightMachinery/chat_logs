[03:59:00] <VarunAgw> brainwashing
[04:01:37] <huf> Me-me: not poor grammar
[04:02:05] <Me-me> The incorrect use of a double negative is incredibly poor grammar.
[04:02:05] <huf> wenxin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negative
[04:02:21] <huf> it's not incorrect
[04:02:23] <Me-me> English is not a language in which a double negative means a negative.
[04:02:24] <Me-me> It is.
[04:02:36] <huf> some dialects of english have negative concord
[04:02:43] <huf> this is blindingly obvious
[04:02:48] <Me-me> Those dialects are incorrect to do so.
[04:02:54] <huf> that's a nonsensical statement
[04:03:32] <Me-me> Besides, you don't mean dialects of English. You mean dialects of American English.
[04:03:40] <huf> so?
[04:03:53] <huf> native speakers are never systematically wrong
[04:04:00] <Me-me> That's not really English. They made that abundantly clear when they intentionally changed spellings and practices to distinguish themselves from the English after the revolution.

[04:05:35] <Me-me> American English is a dialect of English in the same way that the imperial measurement system is an alternative to the metric system. It's really only you, and treating it as anything objective is factually incorrect.
[04:06:00] <huf> you have some super delusional unscientific ideas about english
[04:06:23] <Me-me> And you get really sensitive and defensive about your country's language.
[04:06:37] <huf> I'm not american...
[04:06:39] <huf> you're just a bigot
[04:08:37] <furrykef> Negative concord is not specific to American dialects of English.
[04:08:40] <huf> and even if we pretend you're not stupid and you actually meant that negative concord is not part of any standard english (afaik)
[04:09:02] <huf> that's an incredibly bad explanation for someone asking about an actual example of negative concord
[04:09:14] <huf> but we've had this argument before, last time you retreated
[04:09:25] <huf> good to know you havent read a single fucking wikipedia article on basic linguistics since then
[04:09:28] <Me-me> This isn't a land war to give ground on.
[04:09:28] <huf> way to improve
[04:09:41] <Me-me> I said my piece, and then stopped talking. So did you, eventually.
[04:09:43] <huf> no, this is you being a flat earther
[04:09:55] <huf> and refusing to read up on the science
[04:10:00] <huf> not even obscure papers
[04:10:02] <huf> just wikipedia
[04:10:06] <huf> that's how sad this is
[04:10:15] <Me-me> Eventually.
[04:10:46] <huf> i guess you won by dint of not saying a single factual thing :) gg
[04:11:34] <Me-me> Okay, so, you have a premise there of there necessarily being a "winner". Neither of us convinced the other side of anything, which I would say is the implied goal, and therefore, victory condition.
[04:12:03] <Me-me> And no, I didn't win. Neither did you. It just became this vitriolic torrent of you and the other person spouting insults at me until you had nothing more to say.
[04:12:11] <Me-me> And I had previously run out of things to say as well, much much earlier.
[04:12:35] <Me-me> So the argument ended, without a "victor". Why must everything be confrontational?

[04:13:02] <Me-me> Good lord, it's as though you think you have an audience. Some judges' panel who will arbitrate on who was Right and who was Wrong, both semantically and morally.
[04:13:23] <furrykef> Negative concord was also the norm in Old and Middle English. Why should a dialect group that has used it for hundreds of years suddenly change the way they speak just because some snot-nosed aristocrats in London arbitrarily decided it was wrong?
[04:13:25] <Me-me> At no point did you attempt to curb your hatred and, say, convince me. No, no, that would be showing weakness to the enemy.

[04:16:07] <furrykef> "nas" is an old negative form of "was"
[04:16:15] <Me-me> Aye.
[04:16:45] <Me-me> Thank goodness it's in the public domain.
[04:17:11] <Me-me> Hmm, perhaps it is a more modern decision than I had previously thought.
[04:20:13] <Me-me> I think I still prefer the use of double negatives to mean a positive. It makes more logical sense to me.
[04:21:03] <furrykef> I use double negatives on purpose to annoy the sort of people it annoys. Especially my mom.
[04:21:05] <Me-me> If nothing else, it is useful in the logical constructs one might have cause to invoke. "None of them had no experience," means something different than, "Some of them had some experience," for example.
[04:21:32] <Me-me> Or indeed, "All of them had all necessary experience,"
[04:21:37] <Me-me> *."
[04:21:38] <furrykef> After all, double negatives ain't never hurt nobody none.
[04:21:54] <Me-me> I respectfully disagree, that sentence hurts me deeply.
[04:22:48] <Me-me> Don't not use not enough non-negatives and you won't not confuse nobody.

[07:08:48] <wenxin> TimMc: yeah. maybe it's difficult for you to remember it, but once you familiar with the Chinese family name, it's become easy for you. There are to category of Chinese family name frequently and infrequently 
[07:09:37] <wenxin> even Chinese can not remember all of these. Just remember the frequently name
[07:10:37] <LjL> TimMc, China has used surnames for so long that the vast majority of Chinese people have just a handful of surnames. so learning the entire list would still be pretty long, but you can get 80% or so easily
[07:12:40] <LjL> TimMc, "Believe it or not, 87% of the Chinese population shares approximately 100 last names. These popular last names are referred to as the “hundred common names”, or 百家姓 (bǎi jiā xìng)." (this is the list wenxin mentioned)
[07:15:04] <LjL> %wik Galton–Watson process
[07:16:00] <TimMc> I never thought before about how the length of time a surname system has been in use would affect the distribution.
[07:16:20] <LjL> "Chinese names are a well-studied example of surname extinction: there are currently only about 3,100 surnames in use in China, compared with close to 12,000 recorded in the past,[4][5] with 22% of the population sharing the names Li, Wang and Zhang (numbering close to 300 million people), and the top 200 names covering 96% of the population."
[07:16:48] <LjL> me neither before i learned about this... which was a while ago, it only took me a few minutes to get google to remind me of the name of the phenomenon again ;P
[07:20:00] <xx> is it something bad if surnames go extinct? Everyone'll have a unique number or string identifier already anyway.
[07:20:32] <LjL> thank you, i felt this conversation needed some dystopia to ring right
[07:20:42] <xx> some English ones could use going extinct, like Dickinson...
[07:21:04] <furrykef> In ancient Rome, most citizens had three names (the "tria nomina"). This would be great for telling different people apart, except they often had the same three names anyway. ("Gaius Julius Caesar" in particular became extremely common, especially but not only for emperors.)
[07:21:06] <LjL> if Dick can be a shortened first name...
[07:21:28] <xx> "My surname is Smith, because my ancestor was a smith" "My surname is Dickinson, because, oh, well, how about that weather we're having?"
[07:22:04] <LjL> maybe that's what the stereotype of britons always talking about the weather stems from
[07:22:12] <xx> heh, maybe
[07:22:21] <furrykef> It was particularly common for father and son to share the tria nomina, with "maior" and "minor" used to distinguish the elder and younger, but this was often omitted when it was assumed the listener or reader would know which one you meant.
[07:22:30] <xx> I'm surprised I've actually met more than 1 person in real life that has that surname.
[07:22:41] <LjL> furrykef, and Americans now do the same because, of course, America is Rome.
[07:22:52] <furrykef> I haven't heard of Americans doing it
[07:23:05] <LjL> xx, i can go about as far as saying that i've met more than 1 person in real life.
[07:23:37] <xx> LjL: that statement will have more meaning in the dystopian future
[07:23:38] <TimMc> xx: There are some *really* surprising family names...
[07:23:38] <LjL> furrykef, GWB Senior and Junior?
[07:23:54] <LjL> "Senior" and "Junior" to distinguish father from son seem like a pretty common thing to me in America
[07:23:56] <furrykef> Well, those are George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush
[07:24:10] <furrykef> Though the former was known simply as George Bush until the latter came along
[07:24:12] <LjL> oh so different
[07:24:23] <furrykef> Still not the exact same names
[07:25:15] <LjL> from a somewhat bad Wikipedia article:
[07:25:16] <LjL> In the United States the most common name suffixes are senior and junior, which are abbreviated as Sr. and Jr. with initial capital letters, with or without preceding commas. In Britain these are rarer, but when they are used the abbreviations are Snr and Jnr, respectively. The use of these social terms is governed by etiquette but not enshrined in law. According to The Emily Post Institute, an authority on etiquette, the term Jr. can be correctly used only if a 
[07:25:16] <LjL> male child's first, middle, and last names are identical to his father's (current) names
[07:25:43] <Skunky> if you're going to give your child the same first name as you, do the world a favor and give him or her the same whole name, so they can be junior.  it just causes ALL kinds of trouble when they don't.
[07:26:12] <furrykef> For some people it's common to include the "Jr." even if their father is unknown, e.g. Robert Downey Jr.
[07:26:21] <furrykef> For others, though, it's not, e.g. Phil Hellmuth Jr.
[07:26:22] <xx> Skunky: or just don't have kids and avoid that whole problem of having to decide names
[07:26:25] <TimMc> I vaguely recall something about a country or region where the use of surnames was imposed by a new government, and people just picked weird names for a laugh (like "butt" in the local language), not realizing what they were doing to their descendents' children.
[07:26:36] <Skunky> xx: that's what I chose, myself. :)
[07:27:05] <xx> Skunky: not having kids?
[07:27:28] <furrykef> I actually know of a John Butt.
[07:27:55] <xx> TimMc: maybe that's how Dickinson came about
[07:28:09] <TimMc> That would be Son of Dickin.
[07:28:23] <furrykef> Or son of Dickens
[07:28:28] <TimMc> possibly son of son of Dick, actually..
[07:28:28] <xx> Dickin is still a weird name
[07:28:41] <TimMc> that "in" might be "son of"
[07:28:44] <xx> TimMc: Dickson is a surname I've heard too
[07:29:00] <furrykef> I'm not aware of "in" being used to mean "son of"
[07:29:21] <TimMc> Wikipedia describes "Butting" as meaning "Son of Butt".
[07:29:26] <Skunky> dickinson is likely dickinsson
[07:29:46] <furrykef> Ah, so a contraction of Dickingsson
[07:29:48] <Skunky> names get mutilated when people can't speel.
[07:30:30] <TimMc> My last name is McCormack, with a "mac" on each end. :-)

[11:22:28] <bullgard4> !w transcription
[11:22:29] <tinsoldier> transcription — Noun: 1. The act or process of transcribing., 2. Something that has been transcribed, including:, 3. (obsolete) A written document., 4. (genetics) The synthesis of RNA under the direction of DNA. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transcription
[11:23:20] <Lebela> What is the difference between:  "Leave a comment"  vs.  "Drop a comment" ?
[11:23:38] <Lebela> Or should I better add "kindly" to the mix?
[11:23:46] <Lebela> Kindly leave (us) a comment down below?
[11:24:01] <Lebela> It should be:  1) short 2) to the point 3) polite 
[11:26:07] <MetaNova> Lebela: "Please leave [us] a comment down below"
[11:26:30] <MetaNova> including "us" would make it a bit more personable

[11:27:04] <GuiToris> "...Only formal couples say this..." who are formal couples?
[11:27:09] <GuiToris> tie and a suit?
[11:27:16] <Lebela> Thank you MetaNova !
[11:27:23] <MetaNova> GuiToris: context.....
[11:27:34] *** Quits: cthulchu (~Cthulchu@69-172-160-196.cable.teksavvy.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:27:35] <Lebela> MetaNova, in order to keep things shorter, could I drop the "down below" part?  
[11:27:47] <MetaNova> without context, I can only speculate the "formal" couples would be the couples who are in some fashion formalized
[11:27:55] <Lebela> MetaNova, the longer the text, the smaller the font size, the less the legibility
[11:27:56] <MetaNova> and to me that sounds like marriage
[11:28:14] <MetaNova> Lebela: "Please leave [us] a comment" works fine
[11:28:26] <GuiToris> MetaNova, unfortunately there isn't much, I asked someone if kiss means beso in Spanish, and she replied Yes kiss = beso. Only formal couples say this
[11:28:31] <Lebela> MetaNova, can I bug you with 2 more different options, please?
[11:28:39] <MetaNova> why sure
[11:28:42] <MetaNova> I'm here
[11:28:47] <Lebela> thank you so much!
[11:29:34] <MetaNova> GuiToris: only formal couples say "beso" to mean kiss? I'm still not sure what the situation is
[11:29:38] <Lebela> Experience has proven, that people are more likely to leave comments when being asked a question.
[11:30:01] <Lebela> However, asking a question is a tiny popup window inside the video is a problem as space is limited.
[11:30:15] <Lebela> as I said above, the longer the text, the smaller the font size
[11:30:41] <Lebela> The grammatically correct sentence would be:  "Do you find this video funny, or sad?  Please kindly let us know in the comment section down below"
[11:30:47] <Lebela> however, this is way too long.
[11:30:52] <Lebela> So I was thinking something along the lines:
[11:30:59] <Lebela> "Sad or funny? Leave us a comment :)"
[11:31:05] <MetaNova> too short
[11:31:10] <Lebela> but, this might lose meaning, as it's not clear who is sad or funny
[11:31:12] <GuiToris> MetaNova, I asked her if you say 'beso' as a goodbye
[11:32:13] <MetaNova> GuiToris: okay. you asked her if you say "beso" as a goodbye
[11:32:14] <Lebela> MetaNova, "Do you find this video funny or sad?"

[11:32:32] <MetaNova> GuiToris: and this "she" said that only formal couples say 'beso' as their goodbye?
[11:32:41] <GuiToris> correct
[11:33:05] <MetaNova> some time in the future when you start with the context necessary to understand the question
[11:33:30] <MetaNova> instead of asking a question with no real means of understanding it, then backtracking until it becomes apparent
[11:33:37] <MetaNova> I will be very pleased
[11:34:27] <MetaNova> GuiToris: if she says that only "formal" couples say 'beso' when they are saying their goodbyes I would assume it is a parting term that established couples would use
[11:34:41] <MetaNova> where people who are merely dating would not
[11:35:14] <MetaNova> so, it must have some sort of intimacy that other parting terms wouldn't
[11:35:30] <MetaNova> ... else, ask her what she means by "formal" couples
[11:36:17] <MetaNova> Lebela: you can't shorten it too much, else it loses merit, as it sounds too abrupt or ill-thought-out
[11:36:43] <MetaNova> Lebela: "Was the video funny, or sad? Comment below" is about as short as I'd be comfortable making it
[11:36:48] <Lebela> MetaNova, if I want to keep it at a reasonable font size, I only have 40-50 characters tops
[11:36:49] <GuiToris> MetaNova, you've never used the word 'formal couples', have you?
[11:36:58] <MetaNova> GuiToris: no
[11:36:59] <Lebela> thank you MetaNova 
[11:37:29] <MetaNova> Lebela: if you have a ceiling of 50 characters, I'd suggest a bit more personality to the question, then
[11:37:36] <GuiToris> MetaNova, I didn't dare to ask her because I was afraid that it's only me who don't understand it
[11:37:40] <GuiToris> thank you for helping!
[11:37:47] <MetaNova> "Did you find the video funny, or sad? Please comment below"

[11:38:12] *** Joins: terminalpusher (~terminalp@2a01:586:1e0e:1:24e8:c3d4:a32e:b10)
[11:38:26] <Lebela> Thank you!  Should I put it into the present tense if this question comes while the video is still playing?  "Do you" rather than "Did you" ?
[11:38:38] <MetaNova> Lebela: "Was the video funny, or sad? Please comment below"
[11:38:47] <MetaNova> that's 50 characters. that's my final suggestion
[11:38:52] <Lebela> thank you
[11:38:58] <MetaNova> cheers
[11:39:00] <Lebela> Please kindly clarify the tense.
[11:39:26] <MetaNova> well
[11:39:29] <Lebela> "Did" and "was" are both in the past.  If I were to show this text while the video is still playing (not at the end)  should I opt for the present tense?
[11:39:44] <Lebela> Let's say the text shows after 3 minutes in an 8 minutes long video
[11:39:54] <MetaNova> in my final suggestion, "Was" is assuming that the question is only displayed if the viewer completed viewing of the video
[11:40:05] <Lebela> Sorry for this stupid question, but hard subbing a text into a video makes it permanent, and I want to be sure
[11:40:50] <MetaNova> if you were to ask a question at the beginning of the video, "Was this video entertaining?" obviously wouldn't work
[11:40:56] <Lebela> Unlike these people who get tattoos with Chinese characters which read "Opening times 8 AM - 5 PM"
[11:41:10] <MetaNova> "Stupid foreigner"
[11:41:14] <Lebela> :))
[11:41:43] <Lebela> "Is the video funny, or sad? Please comment below"
[11:42:10] <MetaNova> my problem with that
[11:42:16] <MetaNova> and present tense for the question itself
[11:42:43] <Lebela> "my problem with that" <  which problem do you have?
[11:43:04] <MetaNova> it's implying that the viewer's opinion, feelings, or regard for the video will continue, in some form of persistence
[11:43:48] <MetaNova> if I ask "Was the video funny, or sad?" it has no strings attached, the viewer can choose funny, or sad, or to not respond, and that's the end of it
[11:45:02] <Lebela> Can we re-visit the totally short form I suggested earlier?  Imagine a video or a couple about to get married, but during the ceremony it turns out, that he cheated on her with a bridesmaid.   The bride (not) to be gets angry and smacks the future (not) to be groom and shouts at him.
[11:45:07] <MetaNova> Lebela: "my problem with that" where "that" is, specifically, <Lebela> "Is the video funny, or sad? Please comment below" this proposed version
[11:45:23] <Lebela> Then a popup appears right when he got smacked asking "Justified or over the top?  Comment below!"
[11:45:29] <Lebela> would that be clear enough?
[11:45:39] <MetaNova> yes, that's very good
[11:46:12] <Lebela> Now I am totally confused.
[11:46:17] <Lebela> before you didn't like the short form
[11:46:31] <Lebela> So, it's about the timing / context, right?
[11:46:33] <MetaNova> context makes everything better

[11:47:02] <MetaNova> and, yes. timing is very important
[11:47:11] <Lebela> let's say, the video is half-way through, the meat is disgusting as hell, etc.
[11:47:23] <Lebela> and a popup says:  "Terrible or scientific?  Comment below!"

[11:48:53] <Lebela> how about "disgusting or stunning" ?
[11:49:03] <MetaNova> it's the lack of context which makes me hesitate

[11:52:20] <Lebela> I should have gone with my gut feeling
