[00:37:29] <RonWhoCares_> hi
[00:37:39] *** RonWhoCares_ is now known as RonWhoCares
[00:37:56] <RonWhoCares> I am using an older version of PHP.  I don't understand why today it is crashing
[00:39:36] <AllenJB> What version of PHP? What exactly do you mean by crashing (what exactly happens? Does it always happen? What code is running?)
[00:40:26] *** Quits: nebx_co (~nebx_co@AVP.fm.ColoState.EDU) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:40:51] <RonWhoCares> It is PHP version 7.0
[00:41:14] <RonWhoCares>  [crit] 2078#2078: *578 connect() to unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock failed
[00:41:46] <RonWhoCares> I can see the .sock file in the error
[00:41:56] <RonWhoCares> Do I have a failing SSD drive?
[00:42:30] <AllenJB> I don't think you can jump to that conclusion with just the information you've given us so far
[00:42:43] <AllenJB> Was this setup working previously?
[00:43:00] *** Joins: nebx_co (~nebx_co@129.82.191.31)
[00:43:09] <RonWhoCares> Yes
[00:43:23] <RonWhoCares> Hold on a sec
[00:43:59] <RonWhoCares> Looks like I had 5 months of no issues
[00:44:12] <RonWhoCares> That required an SSD drive to be replaced
[00:45:09] <AllenJB> So you replaced the disk since this was last known to be working?
[00:45:28] <RonWhoCares> One of the SSD drives failed 111 days ago
[00:45:37] <RonWhoCares> I have setup RAID1
[00:45:51] <RonWhoCares> The other SSD drive was replaced 519 days ago
[00:46:02] <RonWhoCares> That is below the WD 'Blue'
[00:46:05] <RonWhoCares> But that is the other drive
[00:46:38] <RonWhoCares> There is one other possibility though
[00:46:50] <RonWhoCares> It is a single board computer.  I could be having a fault with the microSD
[00:46:57] <RonWhoCares> - the microSD is just for booting
[00:47:01] <AllenJB> Is php-fpm currently running according to your service manager? (`service php-fpm status` or equivalent)?
[00:48:14] <RonWhoCares> The correct command is: service php7.0-fpm status
[00:48:18] <RonWhoCares> It shows it is running
[00:48:30] <__adrian> RonWhoCares: we cannot answer whether your ssd is bad. you should go test your ssd. this is not on topic here.
[00:48:37] <RonWhoCares> Do you think chasing PHP as the cupret might  be wrong?
[00:48:53] <__adrian> you're not at the "chasing" stage yet
[00:49:03] <__adrian> you've only just started troubleshooting
[00:49:36] <RonWhoCares> __adrian: So the error I pasted above isn't an issue?
[00:49:54] <RonWhoCares> What I don't understand is if I re-start PHP the web site works again
[00:49:55] <__adrian> the only thing i saw was the connect error
[00:50:17] <__adrian> if you restart php and it works again, that's a pretty strong indication that it's not your disk

[06:21:16] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you?
[06:21:19] <__adrian> hi
[06:21:20] <Rockwood> sir
[06:21:43] <Byteflux> Using `global' is 99.9% an indication that you are designing bad code.
[06:22:08] <Byteflux> Most likely you want to substitute it with objects instead.
[06:22:08] <Rockwood> in case of JS too?
[06:22:48] <jargon> Does this load relatively fast? http://puzzlum.net/?prj=Dungeon%20QB45#thumbs
[06:22:58] <__adrian> where you might legitimately have shared state, yep, objects are a good solution.
[06:23:41] <__adrian> jargon: we're not here to load webpages. you can find out how your page loads without asking us. use your browser's dev tools.
[06:23:47] <Byteflux> If I was hiring someone as a PHP developer, this would be one of the interview questions in the technical assessment... it's such an easy way to root out unqualified developers.
[06:24:08] <__adrian> "write a quick object-oriented system for me"
[06:24:09] <jargon> I am trying to write an ai in PHP that combines multiple BASIC modules into a single engine.
[06:24:17] <__adrian> "btw you can't use any classes or objects"
[06:24:30] <Blondie101010> jargon:  the time to load a page filled with images depends on the link speed
[06:24:46] <Rockwood> Byteflux, i am not agree with you statement
[06:24:57] <Blondie101010> not the number of variables you define globally, and memory use is actually not affected
[06:27:01] <__adrian> finally did another interview today. our technical interviews rarely end up with anyone writing code.
[06:27:31] <Byteflux> Writing code is a kinda useless way to measure someone's competency.
[06:27:47] <Byteflux> You can achieve identical if not better results with a series of good questions.
[06:28:01] <Byteflux> A lot of people can't perform on the spot
[06:28:08] <jargon> Here is the PCRE for my translation module: https://pastebin.com/32VdNYTw
[06:28:08] <__adrian> mm. talking about problem-solving, and opinions on things
[06:28:28] <Blondie101010> yes but some places want someone that's quick to do junk, like a site per day or more
[06:29:04] <__adrian> ironically i think the only time we actually had someone sit down and write code was when i was hired  :p
[06:29:36] <__adrian> it was a weird time for the company apparently. they somehow got the idea that they needed more enterprise-y processes.
[06:29:43] <Rockwood> jargon, is PHP?

[06:34:24] <Byteflux> __adrian: I've been off the job for the past few months recovering from burnout and a cross country move from west to east coast. Been looking recently and it's crazy how hot the job market is right now. Good paying PHP jobs everywhere.

[06:35:21] <Byteflux> Pays to be a PHP engineer with 10+ years of experience, you'll never have a problem getting a job :D
[06:35:52] <Rockwood> is PHP backing?
[06:36:14] <__adrian> TML: the underlying tone of that article seems to be, "man, this is a very questionable thing to be doing in rust, but i guess we're doing it"
[06:36:25] <__adrian> :p
[06:36:43] <TML> __adrian: LOL - yeah, but that's kind of Rust's attitude toward _any_ non-Rust code :)
[06:37:08] <__adrian> well, for exactly the same reason
[06:37:18] <__adrian> they want what they want
[06:38:17] <__adrian> porting zend would be an undertaking
[06:39:32] <Byteflux> rustc is also still super slow last I checked :P
[06:39:41] <Byteflux> doesn't sound like fun
[06:40:19] <__adrian> would be academically fun

[13:11:32] <tihoho> who used arangodb?
[13:12:45] <titus123> is it ok to paste just one line of php code here with my question?
[13:13:20] <tihoho> ofcourse
[13:15:29] <titus123> I am having an issue with a while loop skipping the first row.  The call to myqli_num_rows gives the correct number. The while loop comes up short ... skipping the very first one in the database
[13:15:41] <titus123> here is the code
[13:15:46] <titus123> $num_rows = mysqli_num_rows($result2 ) ...   is 7 -- correct  ...  but the while loops echos only 6 skipping the first one ... while($imglist= $result2->fetch_array()){ echo $imglist['file_name']; }
[13:16:45] *** Joins: Rockwood_ (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[13:17:18] <Naktibalda> the most common cause is that you have another fetch call before the loop
[13:17:33] <titus123> ok, I will look for that
[13:18:39] <titus123> I do actually have this in the while loop:  $imgArray[] = $imglist['file_name'];
[13:19:04] <titus123> I took that out of my paste here as I did not think it made a difference
[13:19:38] <titus123> my actual code looks like this
[13:19:40] <titus123>  $num_rows = mysqli_num_rows($result2 ) ...   is 7 -- correct  ...  but the while loops echos only 6 skipping the first one ... while($imglist= $result2->fetch_array()){ $imgArray[] = $imglist['file_name']; echo $imglist['file_name']; }

[13:20:41] <titus123> is this call reducing the output: $imgArray[] = $imglist['file_name'];
[13:20:56] <Naktibalda> no
[13:22:14] <titus123> ok, I found another        $retimage = mysqli_fetch_row($result2);
[13:22:35] <titus123> perhaps this is redunant code that was in the sample I found and it is not needed?
[13:23:11] <Naktibalda> only you can tell that

[13:30:26] <titus123> naktibalda: I am using $retimage = mysqli_fetch_row($result2); to confirm the number images.  Is this fetch causing my while loop to come up one short?  If so, how can I reset it?
[13:30:58] <Naktibalda> to confirm what?
[13:31:13] <titus123> my while loop is outputting image file names
[13:31:32] <titus123> and the $retimage = mysqli_fetch_row($result2); is conting to see that there is indeed image file name in the db
[13:31:45] <Naktibalda> that's the first image, print it
[13:32:51] <titus123> I could but my code is getting a little out of control... is there a way to reset it so my while loop elsewhere will output all the images including the first one?
[13:33:10] <Naktibalda> you fetch all images to array anyway, move whatever logic you have for $retimage to a point after fetch, and change it to $retimage to $imglist[0]
