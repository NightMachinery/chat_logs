[00:00:34] <Activ8> hold on, do I build from https://github.com/itsjohncs/thelounge.git
[00:00:36] <johncs> Gotcha, no worries. This'll be a bit much I think. Let's try a different method
[00:02:14] <johncs> Go to http://51fd-73-240-17-146.ngrok.io in the browser where right clicking isn't working
[00:02:20] <johncs> Sign in as johncs, the password is muffin
[00:02:38] <johncs> That is a temporary bridge into my development server, it will stop working once we're done testing
[00:02:46] <johncs> See if right clicking works there
[00:03:00] <Activ8> yes right click works
[00:03:07] <Activ8> let me test on ios 
[00:03:13] <Activ8> to see if channel move works
[00:03:25] <johncs> Ah I already destroyed the bridge
[00:03:41] <johncs> Was channel moving not working? I missed that among the bugs you reported
[00:04:01] <Activ8> no chanel move works great on ios on the current master branch
[00:04:13] <johncs> Ah I see, it probably works after that change as well
[00:04:22] <Activ8> it was basically right click on desktop edge but that's working now on the link you sent me

[00:04:38] <johncs> Cool, good to know. I'll add a note to the PR that it resolves that problem with Edge on Windows as well
[00:04:49] <johncs> Thanks!
[00:05:17] <Activ8> cool, but you need to make sure that ios channel move works too that's why I was testing that on ios as well ha
[00:05:28] <Activ8> unless you made no changes to that? right
[00:06:08] <johncs> I'm reasonably confident that PR does not break channel moving
[00:06:17] <thelounge81> ah good stuff that's great.
[00:07:14] <thelounge81> I just updated my docker master build to test my themes with 4.3.0 that was all, I have 4.2.0 and 4.3.0 both in docker containers.  I usually update my master container every few commits into master.

[01:58:50] <mooff> channel jumping seems much more common than printing
[01:59:18] <mooff> how about a patch to also hook it to ctrl-p?
[01:59:57] <Jay2k1> but think of all the people printing their chat!
[02:02:14] <bookworm> C-p makes about as much sense as  alt+j, some people just like it due to some other editor integration
[02:02:32] <bookworm> not like it's a real convention everywhere
[02:03:09] <bookworm> as far as window navigation goes, TL uses alt everywhere, doesn't make much sense consistency wise to add a control mapping
[02:03:25] <Jay2k1> especially when it overrides browser shortcuts
[02:04:49] <mooff> because of vim ctrlp and vs code, it would be discoverable for me
[02:05:48] <bookworm> discoverability comes by reading the help :)
[02:06:01] <mooff> which is not accessible from /help
[02:06:05] <mooff> or ctrl ?
[02:06:23] <bookworm> alt* windows navigation is alt based

[02:07:27] <johncs> Activ8: re: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4328#issuecomment-943755152 are you still seeing sporadic rounding in the sidebar's search bar?
[02:07:47] <johncs> Or are you talking about the search channel history feature's search bar?
[02:08:12] <Activ8> both buddy but I fixed it in the themes css

[02:17:19] <MaxLeiter> mac*?
[02:17:20] <johncs> The styling should be the same
[02:17:25] <Activ8> it's input[type="search"] though so maybe ios knows they are search boxes
[02:17:31] <MaxLeiter> you can use Safari on macOS to inspect mobile 
[02:17:39] <Activ8> I'm not on a mac just a windows box and ios

[02:18:28] <Activ8> it's working for sure because I remove the CSS code and it goes back to normal on refresh
[02:18:50] <Activ8> as soon as I re-apply the CSS the sporadic rounding stops on ios 15
[02:19:04] <johncs> I believe you. The style you applied is being applied to that search input though, so either that's being suppressed somehow or there's something else changing
[02:19:50] <Activ8> some magic in ios lol

[02:20:05] <johncs> Try just checking in your desktop first
[02:20:14] <Activ8> doing it now
[02:20:19] <johncs> See whether -webkit-appearance: none shows up on the sidebar search bar
[02:20:24] <johncs> on master on default or morning theme
[02:21:31] <johncs> I can reproduce the rounding on the channel history search bar on my phone
[02:21:42] <johncs> Though it's quite subtle with the default theme since the contest is very low
[02:22:06] <johncs> But I cannot reproduce the rounding on the sidebar search bar
[02:23:35] <Activ8> I'm trying to jump between my editions I can't see anything in morning or default themes for webkit-appearance
[02:24:07] <johncs> Oh cool, you're problem is almost certainly a caching or deployment issue then. It's unlikely your actually being served the master codebase.
[02:24:12] <johncs> Easy to confirm, I'll set up a bridge again
[02:24:49] <johncs> Please go to http://52c8-73-240-17-146.ngrok.io on your phone Activ8 and try to reproduce the rounding issues
[02:25:00] <johncs> username is johncs and password is muffin
[02:25:18] <Activ8> how are you setting up that bridge if you don't mind me asking
[02:25:37] <johncs> https://ngrok.com
[02:26:18] <Activ8> I don't get that issue on the channel search field it doesn't jump
[02:26:32] <johncs> Rad, you're not being served master's CSS on your deployment Activ8
[02:26:52] <Activ8> but there isn't a main event window search box though 
[02:26:56] <Activ8> which version was that
[02:27:02] <johncs> Good to know about the channel search history's search bar, I'll make a patch for that at some point.
[02:27:34] <Activ8> if I'm not been served the master css that's a bit strange as I do it directly from master when it's building my containers.
[02:27:58] <Activ8> https://github.com/aab12345/thelounge-docker-prod-master is my production docker container
[02:28:01] <johncs> There's lots of things that could be going wrong unfortunately. I need to get back to some other things, but good luck!
[02:29:20] <Activ8> maybe this could be one of the same issues happening for the right click n stuff what we spoke about earlier possibly.  cheers for that link, I'll have a play about.
[02:30:03] <johncs> I'm quite sure your deployment has an issue from our debugging
[02:37:12] <Activ8> I'll see about scrapping my test system and trying it away from docker containers tomorrow

[09:58:30] <bookworm> in fact our packages are hardened by default
[09:58:48] <johncs> It does seem like TL ought to be able to drop root though, has there been opposition to the idea, or just no interest in actually implementing it?
[09:59:12] <bookworm> why would you run TL as root?
[09:59:28] <johncs> So it can bind without a reverse proxy
[10:00:26] <bookworm> it's a non security reviewed hobby project of some random people, it doesn't have the necessary quality and I mean that without offense
[10:00:53] <bookworm> you don't need root to bind to those ports, as said
[10:00:55] <johncs> Frankly I think that meets a sufficient bar of quality 😅
[10:01:12] <johncs> caps seems impractical, and yes you don't need it, but I do think it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do

[10:05:33] <johncs> Like what is the concrete threat is what I was asking?
[10:05:43] <Activ8> @johncs ok sounds good.  
[10:05:47] <bookworm> security isn't easy, relatively trivial to get an issue with node code
[10:06:02] <johncs> Drop rooting typically happens nearly first thing in a project
[10:06:06] <bookworm> no deamon that doesn't need to runs as root onmy system
[10:06:08] *** Joins: Techcable (~Techcable@168.235.93.147)
[10:06:27] <johncs> So the code that would need to not do something horrendous would probably be contained to the code that parses the configuration.
[10:07:08] <Activ8> As long as the documentation is there though I personally don’t mind how it’s run
[10:07:12] <johncs> I mean it makes sense to use a reverse proxy, but the security dangers of drop rooting isn't enourmous
[10:07:32] <johncs> I don't think it's a reasonable thing to plain stop all users of the app using a often more convenient deployment strategy
[10:07:42] <Activ8> im starting to be a little bit more adventurous when it comes to things
[10:08:07] <bookworm> for people who don't want to administer things properly at least shove it in a container
[10:08:20] <bookworm> still bad, but at least you are somewhat contained
[10:10:26] <johncs> I think you're security model is a bit too abstract
[10:10:28] <Activ8> Only reason I run it in a container is so I can have multiple environments on my micro server.  I might switch to a Debian based container and run from deb.  I’m not sure the best ways of doing things yet.
[10:10:55] <johncs> I think we should support drop rooting with TL
[10:11:04] <johncs> It's a convenient deployment strategy
[10:12:38] <bookworm> I don't understand you, there's no point in running TL as root, the perceived convenience is about the same of a allow all firewall and no password on ssh access with root. Is it convenient? sure. Sensible?
[10:13:32] <bookworm> heck at that point you are better of just redirecting 443 to whatever high port TL is running as a non root user

[10:13:44] <bookworm> we can drop it, sure. But to what user?
[10:13:57] <johncs> thelounge of course, the packages already make it
[10:13:59] <bookworm> nobody? Poor idea, need to write to configs
[10:14:23] <bookworm> sure but if you use the packages we have better ways, systemd say
[10:14:52] <bookworm> you need to run a reverse proxy anyhow if you want to run more than one thing on a box
[10:15:03] <bookworm> and chances are you do
[10:16:10] <johncs> The advantage of letting lounge bind to the low ports directly is that you don't need to learn to use a reverse proxy.
[10:16:18] <johncs> Is that not an advantage in your eyes?
[10:16:18] <Activ8> It’s nice the way it works.  It’s working so that’s a good start.  If documentation says run “this command” and it works - great.  When I first installed it I was extremely confused.  Probably because of how many ways it can be installed.
[10:16:56] <johncs> Also does systemd allow a non-privelileged process to bind to a low port?
[10:17:17] <johncs> I haven't actually integrated things with systemd myself
[10:17:52] <johncs> I didn't think it had particularly special powers, but I could imagine some hijinks to allow such a thing
[10:17:54] <Activ8> I think you need to think of users who want to use it who are not technically minded as such.  They just want it to work.
[10:18:35] <Activ8> But with security in mind. Ofc.
[10:19:03] <bookworm> the issue is that those people should not be running services connected to the open internet, that's why you can attack twitter with GB/s of bot traffic (granted, mostly iot devices)
[10:19:25] <bookworm> "just make it work" usually means turning off the security features your OS has
[10:19:44] <Activ8> I understand 
[10:20:04] <bookworm> heck, you need to mess with the firewall anyhow, please don't tell me you have an accept all FW?
[10:20:41] <Activ8> Not me nope, John probably does lol
[10:21:07] <Activ8> john probably doesn’t use a fw 😂
[10:21:14] <bookworm> johncs: besides adding caps (doesn't work because node) systemd can handover sockets afaik, but that needs code changes too
[10:21:40] <johncs> Don't dis me Activ8, wth
[10:22:06] <johncs> Unnecessary
[10:22:27] <Activ8> Was just a joke John I don’t dis anyone I’m the worst for understanding things 😊
[10:23:50] <johncs> Alright
[10:24:29] <johncs> All drop rooting does is allow someone to not have to use a reverse proxy
[10:24:32] <johncs> Nothing else needs to change
[10:24:38] <johncs> You don't need to do all the absurd things you're saying
[10:24:53] <johncs> Firewall is the same as with nginx
[10:25:05] <Activ8> Would it take much code changes though @johncs ?
[10:25:11] <Activ8> I bet it would
[10:25:21] <bookworm> not really no
[10:25:30] <johncs> It wouldn't. Node ships with a server
[10:25:35] <johncs> The SSL cert would be annoying
[10:25:38] <johncs> That's about it
[10:25:50] <bookworm> some restructuring to only do stuff as root which is really necessary and off you go
[10:26:22] <johncs> You'd basically have "loadConfig(), bind(), dropRoot()" at the top, then some normal web server stuff, and then that's it
[10:26:50] <bookworm> the problem is that loadConfig creates files iirc
[10:26:56] <bookworm> it shouldn't try that as root
[10:27:03] <bookworm> files/dirs that is
[10:27:26] <johncs> Ah yeah, agreed, have to be split to load just enough to know how to bind, then finish config
[10:27:33] <johncs> afterwards
[10:28:56] <Activ8> So how would it be installed? From source only? Or would it still allow you to install from deb/ docker ? Etc
[10:29:14] <bookworm> might just be the plugins code that does that which is later in the chain
[10:29:16] <johncs> Honestly I don't know that the effort to support it would be worth it, given that better packaging or even putting time into good install documentation would go farther
[10:29:25] <johncs> But I do think it'd be very reasonable to do
[10:29:55] <bookworm> the issue with docs is that nginx is a effing nightmare to configurr. We can't and should not replace the upstream docs
[10:29:55] <johncs> This would be for people installing from source, most likely

[10:30:54] <bookworm> ^ that's what we have, the nginx / apache configs are excerpts that people rarely understand
[10:31:31] <bookworm> but the distro default configs are opinionated, and not necessarily the same so we can't make a full config example that fits all
[10:32:02] <bookworm> debian likes the symlinked sites-availabe sites-enabled dirs with one server per file

[10:36:18] <bookworm> yeah... it has interesting defaults too and some nonsensical ones. Oh you have no default server? Let me then reroute this *completely unrelated* requests to whatever server comes first
[10:36:40] <bookworm> makes sense, I mean why drop it /s
[10:37:17] <johncs> ahaha that one took me some time to wise up to. I have a vague memory of making curl requests and being very confused.
[10:37:27] <bookworm> sorry, pet pieve. Back on topic... there are easier proxies nowdays
[10:37:47] <bookworm> TL will not need the performance nginx can give you if you tune it heavily
[10:39:10] <johncs> Hm I forgot none of these packages actually end up with a result of "TL is being served publicly"
[10:41:05] <bookworm> what packages are you talking about? The distro ones?
[10:41:56] <johncs> Yes, but also all of them right?
[10:42:25] <bookworm> there's very different concepts behind some of the "packages" docker does docker stuff
[10:42:57] <johncs> Fair, would be strange for the docker  container to come with some auto-tunneling thing
[10:43:01] <bookworm> Arch would be running publicly, assuming misconfigured firewall and that the admin started the unit
[10:43:14] <johncs> But I really haven't messed with docker outside of small hobby stuff, I don't know what's normal
[10:43:44] <bookworm> TL packages should not handle the proxy config, wrong order
[10:43:47] <johncs> High port binding on all hosts?
[10:44:22] <bookworm> docker doesn't care, it's NAT / port forwarding all the way down
[10:44:42] <bookworm> and our packages just use the default config, meaning 9000

[10:45:29] <johncs> Oh interesting, we bind to all interfaces by default
[10:45:35] <bookworm> they expect you to configure TL prior to starting it, well Arch at least
[10:45:38] <bookworm> yes
[10:45:47] <johncs> The seems incongruent
[10:45:53] <johncs> *that
[10:46:18] <johncs> full thought: binding to all interfaces seems incongruent given the emphasis on reverse proxying
[10:46:22] *** Joins: whysthatso1 (~whysthats@74-206-50-195.sta.estpak.ee)
[10:46:39] <bookworm> you don't have to bind to 443 to play around
[10:46:57] <bookworm> you can go https://whatever:9000 just fine
[10:47:32] <johncs> Sure but you'd at least need to configure the firewall. A passing thought anyways 🤷‍♀️
[10:47:34] <bookworm> but sure, I'd have chosen localhost if I made the choice
[10:47:44] <bookworm> one would hope
[10:47:57] <bookworm> not sure what distros do by default nowdays
[10:48:23] <bookworm> Arch doesn't come with anything pre configured so admins are expected to manually set it up
[10:48:24] <johncs> I imagine there's a very small reverse proxy we could package with 🤔. There's probably some fine node packages out there.
[10:48:37] <bookworm> please no
[10:48:41] <johncs> Haha why
[10:48:55] <bookworm> distros already package all of the proxies you might possibly want
[10:49:13] <bookworm> we aren't a mono repo
[10:49:27] <johncs> A reverse proxy in node meant to only serve one thing would be very small. I'm basically suggesting a framework solution to drop rooting.
[10:49:42] <johncs> The node server can proxy requests just fine, I've written that a few times.
[10:49:51] <bookworm> sure it can
[10:50:05] <bookworm> I can write a proxy in go in a few lines of code as well
[10:50:12] <bookworm> doesn't mean we need to ship it
[10:50:23] <bookworm> let caddy et al do that
[10:50:57] <johncs> You never answered this: do you think not having to learn how to use a reverse proxy is an advantage?
[10:51:02] <bookworm> no
[10:51:16] <johncs> Alright, then there's nothing really to talk about. It's the only advantage.
[10:51:25] <bookworm> because you are putting a service on the internet, you *need* to learn what a firewall is
[10:51:32] <johncs> Firewall != reverse proxy
[10:52:01] <bookworm> if you know what a fw is and how to adjust it you can simply map 443 to 9000 and you don't need a reverse proxy
[10:52:35] <bookworm> you only need a reverse proxy to multiplex and for some security aspects / cert handling etc
[10:54:28] <johncs> Hm, that's an interesting idea for a simplified installation
[10:54:51] <bookworm> I get where you are coming from  It's nice if you can just spin something up and get the endorphin kick
[10:55:19] <johncs> I'm thinking about people who aren't like us and spend our lives knee deep in system administration and code
[10:55:24] <bookworm> sure
[10:55:25] <johncs> It's not about the endorphin kick
[10:55:38] <bookworm> those shouldn't be attaching stuff to the internet
[10:55:40] <johncs> it's about being accessible and not having to climb a mountain to get an irc bouncer running
[10:55:46] <johncs> It's fine, they should do that
[10:55:51] <johncs> They'll fuck things up and learn
[10:55:56] <johncs> didn't you?
[10:56:14] <johncs> When I was young I deleted an entire forum on accident.
[10:56:18] <johncs> No backups
[10:56:20] <johncs> Just gone
[10:56:28] <bookworm> fuck up? Often. In a nighmare open way? No
[10:56:45] <johncs> What do you mean not in a nightmare open way?
[10:56:55] <johncs> Like you didn't expose anything to the internet until you had fucked up a lot?
[10:57:02] <bookworm> firewall full open, chmod 777 etc
[10:57:11] <johncs> That's not what we're talking about
[10:57:39] <johncs> That's a fairly extreme low-security deployment that we're frankly not going to be able to hinder or support
[10:57:59] <johncs> Like that's just going to happen if it's gonna
[10:58:05] <bookworm> sure
[10:58:23] <bookworm> but to be honest setting up TL isn't really complicated
[10:58:48] <bookworm> all the nice and fancy stuff isn't needed to get it up and running locally just to test
[10:58:57] <johncs> I dunno... I feel like it sorta is. It's not complicated if you have a lot of knowledge
[10:59:05] <johncs> But like, even SSH is a new concept to a lot of people
[10:59:13] <bookworm> yes, sure
[10:59:44] <bookworm> but they need to be willing to learn and yes that involves reading dry docs. Lots and lots of them
[11:00:01] <bookworm> welcome to the administration role ;P
[11:00:26] <johncs> Haha for sure, there's lots to learn. I've been advocating for lessening the number of things to learn. I think each new thing is a lot when you start with nothing.
[11:00:39] <bookworm> fire and forget someone else configured it for you installations are better of with docker and a gui orchestration engine
[11:00:57] <bookworm> and there's plenty of those
[11:01:44] <johncs> Sure, that'd be a reasonable thing to push people towards. "Want to install the lounge? Go to this website and click the big button that says "gimme the lounge"".

[11:03:51] <johncs> But foreign is also a reasonable adjective for it
[11:04:51] <johncs> I was a programmer long before I was a system admin, and I remember learning how to configure a bunch of things with a team of sys admins... my instinct was to try to come up with some unifying configuration language to make it easier.

But when I tested it on john's test url with the commits, it worked on my side.  I just thought about something, maybe I never cleared the cache my side for the changes to take hold as the

[12:35:01] <fnutt> I have a slightly different opinion about Nachtalb's pull requests. He did a lot of work - so the least we can do is to help and merge those that can be merged before they are out of date and requires a lot of work to get going.
[12:35:14] <fnutt> THat way we honor his work.
[12:39:59] <johncs> Ah yeah that's fair, I think I grouped them together a little too strongly. The one I linked earlier looks like it can just be merged in honestly.
[12:40:05] <Activ8> he's done some nice work there I can see it's all nice changes
[12:40:47] <johncs> I don't want to dev work to finish the unfinished PRs, but we might as well try to bring in any that are either ready, or just needs a quick patch on top of that we can merge in at the same time
[12:41:17] <fnutt> That would be very nice indeed.
[12:42:45] <johncs> Kinda pumped on the reaction work again though... Excited to mess with our sqlite schema 😂
[12:43:08] <johncs> Will do both
[12:43:41] <johncs> Well, I wanna hear from Max too about whether he has any reservations about pulling these PRs in if they are safe though. He's the one with the actual say.
[12:44:23] <bookworm> johncs: you can't actually use the msgid from the server as an internal primary id, keep that in mind. It isn't guaranteed to be unique
[12:44:41] *** Joins: Vercas7 (~Vercas@gateway/tor-sasl/vercas)
[12:44:58] <bookworm> we need to add a unique, primary key for our schema, preferably auto incrementing
[12:45:07] <johncs> oh that's an interesting consideration
[12:45:20] <bookworm> fixing up the existing dbs was already a point pf quite some discussion
[12:46:11] <bookworm> we need the msg id for things like the search or jump to highlight as well
[12:46:20] <bookworm> (the db internal one)
[12:46:34] <bookworm> currently we just use the date, which is suboptimal
[12:46:38] <johncs> yeah... the thing that jumped out to me immediately is that it might be useful to be able to say "I would like all the messages in this timeframe and also all the reactions to any of these messages"
[12:46:44] <bookworm> yes
[12:47:03] *** Quits: Vercas (~Vercas@gateway/tor-sasl/vercas) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[12:47:04] *** Vercas7 is now known as Vercas
[12:47:13] <bookworm> and usually you rather want x messages of context, rather than time
[12:47:27] <bookworm> as that os very different for a busy vs non busy chan
[12:47:45] <bookworm> 1h can be 100s of messages or barely 1
[12:48:02] <johncs> makes sense. fortunately could have the same index either way
[12:48:23] <bookworm> not really, one would be based on id and the other by date
[12:48:34] <bookworm> date range query would need their own index
[12:48:50] <bookworm> at least if you want to do it in the db, not sure what sqlite supports
[12:49:00] <johncs> was talking about n messages vs messages in timeframe
[12:49:09] <bookworm> me too
[12:49:24] <johncs> can walk the index down and up a certain number, or until you get to a certain date
[12:50:35] <bookworm> sure, although if you give the query planner an index over the date I'm fairly sure it would prefer to filter down to the timeframe first, prior to filtering for the channel
[12:50:59] <bookworm> alas I'm not quite familiar with sqlite and what it does and does not optimize
[12:51:23] <johncs> yeah was thinking about whether these indexes are even giving performant boons
[12:51:25] <bookworm> not our problem really if the performance is acceptable
[12:51:49] <bookworm> they should in principle, at the cost of space
[12:52:13] <bookworm> can do it client side too, but let's start walking before we run ;P
[12:52:58] <bookworm> primary id os the bare minimum change we need for all kinds of things anyhow
[12:53:15] <johncs> Ah the problem isn't quite as bad as I worried when you said that, spec says "The tag value MUST be a unique ID chosen by the originating server. Uniqueness in this context means that any other message transmitted on the entire network at any time MUST NOT share the same value."
[12:53:36] <johncs> So we just have to consider mis-implemented servers
[12:53:48] <bookworm> just don't use it for anything but reactions
[12:53:56] <bookworm> we should have our own ID
[12:54:24] <johncs> there's a lot of options, I'll try to think through them
[12:54:54] <bookworm> >Handling duplicates gracefully is also useful in the case of servers accidentally reusing an ID.
[12:55:13] <johncs> course
[12:55:29] <bookworm> you also have to support servers which don't have that cap, so we need to keep it as an additional thing abyhow

[12:57:22] <bookworm> can't use the db then though
[12:57:31] <bookworm> as you can't actually query for them
[12:57:44] <johncs> "please install this sqlite extension"
[12:57:49] <johncs> 😆
[12:57:57] <bookworm> sqlite is a relational db, not a nosql dump
[12:58:17] <johncs> haha the lines are more blurred now then that
[12:58:23] <bookworm> so they say
[12:58:52] <bookworm> I mean we can go full postgres then you can put your blob in *and* query it
[12:59:08] <bookworm> but in this case you could just add a proper column
[12:59:32] <bookworm> assuming that quite a bunch of ircv3 things will rely on the id
[12:59:42] <bookworm> say edits / deletes / reactions....
[12:59:51] <bookworm> replies
[13:00:09] <johncs> oh damn, sqlite can index on expressions
[13:00:15] <johncs> hm, so many options
[13:00:23] <bookworm> don't get too smart, keep it simple
[13:00:24] <johncs> i love sqlite, always surprises me with how great it is

[13:01:14] <johncs> haha don't worry
[13:01:19] <johncs> i mean i might use that feature

[13:01:30] <johncs> i don't know what i'll do but i'll weigh everything properly
[13:01:50] <bookworm> why do you want to store it as a json blob?
[13:01:59] <bookworm> actually curious
[13:02:44] <johncs> ah, tags are almost-inherently unstructured data. we have the specs but ehhh. it might be appropriate to say "we only accept these tags" and then have them as columns. but it's also quite natural to store them as unstructured data.
[13:02:52] <johncs> if indeed we actually want to store all tags
[13:02:58] <johncs> but that's not obvious at all
[13:03:07] <bookworm> I don't think you need to

[13:30:19] <johncs> haha i don't quite see the allure there but can't be really go too wrong when you have such (i think...) low volume of data
[13:31:06] <johncs> think 100 million rows of logs is very large? or kinda normal large?
[13:31:22] <johncs> i mean, how common do you think a TL installation is that has 100 million rows

[13:39:06] <bookworm> we aren't
[13:39:22] <bookworm> that is, not that I know

[13:52:27] <bookworm> green open, red = nope
[13:52:31] <johncs> haha i should maybe start with replies... i think the design will be way simpler... but i actually want reactions
[13:52:52] <johncs> i don't know that i'd really use replies much
[13:53:05] <bookworm> I mean replies are just stuffing a tag that says which message you are replying to
[13:53:20] <bookworm> the irc side isn't the problem, the UI is
[13:53:40] <johncs> yeah they're pretty much the same difficulty for TL's server
[13:53:51] <johncs> UI for reactions is going to be trickier
[13:54:05] <bookworm> sadly reply is already a method in irc-framework, I was hoping that this could be streamlined a bit
[13:54:29] <bookworm> reply as is just means, privmsg to channel where it came from, rather than an actual reply
[13:54:46] <bookworm> s/channel/target/ but you know what I mean
[13:54:47] <johncs> haha i'm sure that won't confuse anyone
[13:55:10] <bookworm> well, it made sense at the time
[13:55:18] <bookworm> the spec is newer than the framework
[13:55:47] <bookworm> not all methods expose tags either, so this needs some wrappers I think
[13:56:04] <johncs> honestly it seems fine, i don't think a method in irc-framework to handle the adding of the tag will be good. probably best to have it nice and explicit in the caller since the caller is gonna be dealing with the tag directly on the other end.
[13:56:21] <bookworm> yes, but it isn't exposed everywhere last I checked
[13:56:54] <bookworm> some person just added them to the standard privmsg helpers on the client itself, but not on the convenience helpers on the message objects iirc
[13:56:57] <johncs> oh interesting. maybe i will get to patch irc-fraamework

[21:09:27] <easymac> you just add it to your Home Screen from safari 
[21:09:45] <easymac> there is somewhere a native app floating around that plugs into it and will offer push notifications but 
[21:09:56] <easymac> i don't really think that's a desirable solution 
[21:11:54] <halogen8> easymac thanks!  yeah, I didnt even think of adding it from safari, but the push notifications would be nice
[21:13:49] <easymac> this is what i was thinking of https://github.com/roma-apps/AppIRC
[21:13:57] <easymac> but i wouldn't get your hopes up

[21:34:54] <Activ8> runs as root as a test so I don't have to mess with docker
[21:35:45] <Activ8> I bet I could make a silent windows installer package.  Not that I would want to though.  I don't know how many people would like it to run on a windows box.
[21:36:20] <johncs> Nicely done
[21:36:49] <Activ8> that means I can test better I know 100% it runs from source then
