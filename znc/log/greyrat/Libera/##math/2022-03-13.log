[00:24:07] <blackk> I have a question about the eulers totient function
[00:24:58] <blackk> I think it is true for numbers from 1..n , the function achieves its maximum at the largest prime <= n
[00:25:25] <blackk> I just don't find any literature on this
[00:27:35] <river> it's true because phi(p) = p-1, whereas phi(ab) = phi(a)phi(b) when a,b are coprime
[00:28:02] <blackk> I dont see how that proves it
[00:28:10] <blackk> at least immediately
[00:28:22] *** Quits: jpn (~jpn@user/jpn) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:28:36] <river> well it is not enough to prove it
[00:28:51] <river> but it can prove that phi(p) > phi(n) for p > n
[00:29:10] <blackk> sure
[00:29:20] <blackk> but if n>p  and there is no prime in between
[00:29:26] <river> to prove that phi(p) is largest until we see another prime is difficult, maybe not even always true...
[00:30:14] <blackk> a formula for the prime gap could help
[00:30:24] *** Joins: soapsudsxx (~soapsudsx@209.221.40.152)
[00:30:35] <river> i guess we could try to think about the worst case
[00:30:48] <river> suppose the next prime is q
[00:30:52] <blackk> it doesnt hurt to think that n=q-1 where q is the next prime
[00:30:53] *** Quits: soapsudsxx (~soapsudsx@209.221.40.152) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:31:05] <blackk> so that if g is the gap
[00:31:10] <blackk> then q = p+g-1
[00:31:11] <river> the highest phi(n) will be with p < n < q is probably n=r^2 for some prime r
[00:31:23] <river> in which case phi(n) = (r-1)^2
[00:31:28] <blackk> Im not sure
[00:31:37] <blackk> I think it is of the form product of two primes
[00:31:52] <blackk> well actually you may be right
[00:31:56] <river> yeah maybe beter to be more general and consider rr'
[00:32:04] <blackk> but having a square is not always possible
[00:32:31] <blackk> phi(r^2)  is r²-r
[00:32:34] <blackk> not (r-1)²
[00:32:39] <river> oops ,thank you
[00:33:04] <river> but for now. can we have p-1 < r^2-r the limiting factor is r^2 < q which is < 2p (bertrand)

[11:29:27] <Neeknaim> Hello
[11:30:12] <Neeknaim> I got a question which I thought is simple but it turns out something in my logics isn't correct. Could you please help me understand what I'm getting wrong here?

[11:33:16] <Neeknaim> The question is this: There's a secretary that has n personal letters (for n different people) and has n envelopes with the addresses of those people. Because of lack of time each letter is inserted randomly to an envelope and is sent. What is the probability that no would enter to the correct envelope?

[11:35:57] <Neeknaim> I thought something like that. let's say n=4: The chance that the first letter wouldn't get to the right envelope is 3/4, then we have 3 letters with 3 envelopes, the chance that the second letter wouldn't get to the correct envelope is 2/3, and then we're left with 2 letters, the chance that the third wouldn't get to the correct letter is 1/2. We multiply all probabilities and get 1/4. Same goes for n and we should get 1/n.
[11:36:12] <Neeknaim> But the solution I saw was completely different
[11:37:11] <Neeknaim> The answer was sum(i=1 to n) of ((-1)^n) / i!

[12:12:36] <mickey> im doing some linear regression analysis on a time series, and i get really ugly betas (coefficients) like 0.001 and such so i applied ln(x) on all values which pretty much sorted out that problem, but ln(0) would be -inf which isn't very ideal. if i apply ln(x+1) instead of just ln(x), would the model be hurt by this?

[12:19:39] <PlanckWalk> (But why you think the logs are linear)
[12:20:29] <mickey> im not sure i understand your question
[12:20:52] <mickey> the data is thrown at spss to do linear regression
[12:21:02] <Neeknaim> pounce: I'm still here
[12:21:46] <pounce> Neeknaim: ok, so you need to consider whether all of these cases are truely independent
[12:22:22] <pounce> call the receivers of these 4 envelopes A B C D, and the event that X's letter gets put in Y_s envelope by E_Y(X) or something
[12:23:01] <pounce> suppose that we are considering the event E_A(C)\cap E_B(D)

[12:23:15] <pounce> what is the probability _now_ that C and D receive the wrong letter?
[12:23:40] <Neeknaim> what does "\" stands for in E_A(C)\cap E_B(D)?
[12:23:59] <pounce> Neeknaim: I'm using latex notation. `\cap` means "union"
[12:24:11] <pounce> err, intersection
[12:24:14] <pounce> suppose both those events occur

[12:25:20] <pounce> yes
[12:25:37] <Neeknaim> hmmm
[12:26:10] <Neeknaim> I see, so in this case 2 errors are enough for all of the people to not get their mail correctly
[12:27:16] <pounce> Neeknaim: not necessarily

[12:28:06] <pounce> what is the probability of success then
[12:28:18] <Neeknaim> 1/2?
[12:28:29] <pounce> anyway, I'm saying that there is more going on here, the probability that one person gets their letter wrong _influences_ the probability that others do
[12:28:38] *** Joins: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso)
[12:29:21] <pounce> in particular, the probability that the first person gets their letter wrong is 3/4. However, the probability that the second one does is 1/3*100%+2/3*1/3
[12:29:51] <pounce> so less than 1/3!
[12:29:59] <pounce> do you see why that is the case?
[12:30:44] <Neeknaim> just a second, let me think about it
[12:31:22] *** Joins: smallville7123 (~smallvill@cpe-172-193-200-97.qld.foxtel.net.au)
[12:34:05] <pounce> wait, 1/3*100%+2/3*2/3, but that's still 2/3 huh
[12:35:48] <Neeknaim> it's 1/3*100%+2/3*2/3 because it's 1/3*100%+1/3*2/3 + 1/3*2/3, right?
[12:35:56] *** Quits: smallville7123 (~smallvill@cpe-172-193-200-97.qld.foxtel.net.au) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:36:22] <pounce> right, so there's a 1/3 chance that A was wrong because B's was chosen
[12:36:27] <pounce> and a 2/3 chance it wasn't the case
[12:36:56] <Neeknaim> We're summing the probabilities for the next 3 people to not get their letter when one will absolutely wouldn't get his letter since his envelope is already taken, and the next 2 people have a chance of 2/3 to get the wrong envelope)
[12:37:48] <pounce> Neeknaim: yeah your formulation seems more right
[12:37:59] <pounce> anyway sorry chance for second person is 7/9 not 2/3
[12:38:06] <pounce> and i bet you can figure out the rest

[12:42:30] <Neeknaim> I understand now that for the next step, when we're left with 2 peolple we should calculate the sum of 2 cases, one where the first and second person (of 4) got their envelopes mixed together and another where in the second person got an envelope of either the 3rd or 4th person
[12:43:08] *** Joins: caveman (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[12:43:20] <pounce> Neeknaim: yes, and make sure to remember that the 3rd person's case will probably depend on both of the cases we just found
[12:44:00] <pounce> e.g. if E(B) happened we have a 1/2 chance we used C's letter, if E(
[12:44:04] <pounce> err sorry messed up
[12:44:27] <pounce> if E_A(B) happened then we only have to consider E_B, otherwise you have to consider both
[12:44:31] <pounce> that is why you get the big sum
[12:46:13] <Neeknaim> "we only have to consider E_B" --> What is the meaning of E_B without another parameter?
[12:47:23] <pounce> Neeknaim: you consider the cases of it, e.g. E_B(C) and everything else
[12:47:52] <Neeknaim> ok, got it
[12:48:01] <Neeknaim> Thanks! it's a nice question

[21:39:42] *** Quits: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:40:00] <somiaj> Probably same way  you did, you want to choose two unique things in {1,2,3,...,n} which is C(n,2) possiblities
[21:40:01] <newpy> there are n ways to choose i, but I'm not sure how to calculate # of possible j's conditioned on that
[21:40:17] *** Quits: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:40:20] <somiaj> well n*(n-1)/2 (the dividing by 2 removes order)
[21:40:22] <newpy> oh wait right
[21:40:33] <newpy> it doesn't matter which is i and which is j, one will be lower than the other haha
[21:40:39] <somiaj> so n ways to choose i, n-1 ways to choose j, remove order by dividing by two, but that is the same as C(n,2)
[21:40:42] <somiaj> yup
