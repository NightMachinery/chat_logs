[04:53:43] <FromGitter> <alex-ilin> I've got an issue with completion in Spacemacs `develop`. When I want to type `begin` followed by <Enter> because it's at the end of the line, the completion framework picks up a random function name from the project, such as `BeginUpdate`, and substitutes that instead. ‚èé How can I make it  so that if a valid completion is fully typed, it would have priority over longer options? ‚èé If that is not known, what 
[04:53:44] <FromGitter> ... is the completion framework used in Spacemacs, so that I could go read their docs?
[04:56:18] <FromGitter> <alex-ilin> My only configuration related to completion is in the `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`: ‚èé  ‚èé ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=61d4f3ba9a33545406080c09]
[05:51:37] <FromGitter> <glmdgrielson:matrix.org> I doubt it, and it's for a rather technical reason: terminal input. Back in the days of the terminal, not every keyboard had all of the buttons. One exception being the space cadet keyboard, which has too many buttons.
[05:53:12] <FromGitter> <glmdgrielson:matrix.org> The result of this is that terminals would cheat and use a modifier to do basically the same thing. The important part is that the terminal eats the `C-i` input and returns something indistinguishable from a `TAB`.
[05:53:28] <FromGitter> <glmdgrielson:matrix.org> But then, I could also be horribly wrong.

[22:38:12] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I can't find documentation for configuring `jump-to-definition`. I am surprised it doesn't work out of the box. I get no error message when using `, g g` or `g d`, just nothing happens. My search led me to something about gtags which seems like way too much for this functionality. Is there a simple way to get this up and running and should I file an issue requesting that it come pre-configured?
[22:40:00] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @mcp292 Which language are you using, and did you install the `lsp` layer?
[22:42:43] <FromGitter> <mcp292> need support for C and python. Using python right now
[22:43:10] <FromGitter> <mcp292> yes, but it said something about installing `npm` for `pyright` which I'd rather not do
[22:43:17] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I could try the other server

[22:51:54] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I am not sure. I think Spacemacs offers to install a language server by default.
[22:52:05] <FromGitter> <mcp292> @dalanicolai actually, it worked temporarily. It asked me to import my project so I pointed it to the root dir of the project, now when I `g d` it says "Object reference not set to an instance of an object".
[22:52:47] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> The thing is, there are more choices. Maybe it could be better documented in the layer docs... but I guess it is not too bad... however, if you ding things to improve... just do it
