[19:37:39] <headius> Jason van Zyl: hey there, you found the channel
[19:38:40] <headius> assuming you mean GraalVM Native Image, the experiments are on hold but I was able to POC some changes to JRuby to let it start up, parse code, and run in a native binary
[19:39:20] <headius> it only runs interpreted because there's no way to load new bytecode into a native image, but it should be natural to extend the POC to precompile all Ruby code into the image
[19:40:12] <headius> re: your questions about maven and Christian... I believe he is still around but after so many years we are largely fending for ourselves. I fear the day when we have a critical problem with the release artifact builds and can't get any help untangling the mess we have right now
[19:41:07] <headius> there are also many support plugins based on JRuby that have needed attention, such as updating to a newer version of JRuby, and those updates have not happened and we do not have push rights for those artifacts
[20:09:11] <headius> enebo: you might want to review https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi/pull/254 also
[20:09:31] <headius> it's attempting to fix string terminator handling when the native encoding is not ascii-compat
[20:10:16] <headius> the code seems ok to me but another person doing a read through would be good

[20:55:39] <enebo[m]> I did not spend very much on indexOf but otherwise it looks good to me
[21:01:52] <headius> ok
