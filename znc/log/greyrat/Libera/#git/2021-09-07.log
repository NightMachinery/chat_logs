[01:53:45] <bookworm> so it wouldn't make sense as a default... you'd be rewriting the whole history for no reason
[01:53:51] <mehwork> ugh, i just tried squashing 45 of those commits with 'git rebase -i HEAD~45' and putting 'f' for all but the top one. My local 'git log' looks right but 'git push' says: ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
[01:54:07] <bookworm> of course

[01:54:15] <gitinfo> Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

[01:55:58] <mehwork> woohoo it worked, thanks
[01:57:18] <Shentino> So I made a huge mess of all my repositories.  What's the best way to find the common "root" commit for a bunch of branches?
[01:57:45] <Shentino> like is there a way to get a graph of some sort of my branches and their commit ancestries?
[01:58:26] <bookworm> to look at? sure
[01:58:29] <bookworm> !lol
[01:58:29] <gitinfo> A nifty view of branches, tags, and other refs: git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
[01:58:53] <eggbean> Whenever I try git stashing a specific file (usually in order to rebase) I get an error message:

[01:59:01] <eggbean> The intended files does get stashed, but it stays in the working directory and also gets staged. What could be happening?

[09:57:49] <ec> Hi, all. I'm trying to write a script that stashes some work *except* in a particular directory; but I can't wrap my head around the `pathspec` documentation.
[09:58:02] <ec> If I issue the command `git stash push --keep-index --quiet -m 'doc.sh: HIDING UNSTAGED WORK FROM DOCS
[09:58:02] <ec> ' -- ':!:Docs'`, I get:
[09:58:10] <ec> "fatal: empty string is not a valid pathspec. please use . instead if you meant to match all paths"
[09:58:36] <ec> How should I, instead, perform a keep-index stashing, without touching, stashing, or restoring anything in the `Docs` folder?
[09:59:14] <onichomp> are books about git from 2012 still viable as a way to learn? im not sure how much has git changed in 10 years

[10:10:12] <onichomp> i was considering reading ¨ Version Control with Git: Powerful tools and techniques for collaborative software development
[10:10:12] <onichomp>  by Jon Loeliger, Matthew McCullough¨ but its from a decade ago
[10:10:45] <igemnace> !book
[10:10:45] <gitinfo> There are several good books available about git; 'Pro Git' is probably the best: https://git-scm.com/book but also look at !bottomup !cs !gcs !designers !gitt !vcbe and !parable

[12:05:36] <cbreak> Haohmaru: they're used to populate meta data fields in your commits
[12:05:37] <geirha> they are used for the Author and Committer properties of the commit

[12:07:04] <geirha> it does not have to match any username or email on gitlab
[12:07:04] <cbreak> remember that this will essentially be public information for everyone that clones it
[12:07:15] <cbreak> so you should use a dedicated e-mail address that you can abandon if needed
[12:07:16] <Haohmaru> okay, now it either doesn't like my username or my password, or.. <both.gif>
[12:07:23] <cbreak> password? :O
[12:07:25] <cbreak> use ssh :D
[12:07:44] <Haohmaru> when i press "push", it asks me for my gitlab username, then the password
[12:08:06] <Haohmaru> hm, i used the https://... gitlab
[12:09:07] <cbreak> I don't like https
[12:09:20] <cbreak> I recommend ssh
[12:09:25] <Haohmaru> i tried the git thing, but it didn't work
[12:09:35] <cbreak> if you insist on https, you might need to create a dedicated application password
[12:09:50] <cbreak> the git protocol is read only and unencrypted
[12:09:55] <cbreak> and unauthenticated
[12:10:01] <cbreak> you can't push with it
[12:10:07] <cbreak> ssh is the best option.
[12:10:34] <geirha> you probably have to add an ssh public key to your gitlab account before it gives you the ssh url
[12:10:44] <Haohmaru> i mean, i first tried the "clone with SSH: git@gitlab.com:blahblah/project.git"
[12:10:48] <Haohmaru> and it didn't work
[12:13:30] <Haohmaru> whether i cloned it with the ssh or the https, is that stored in the .git folder? can i "change my mind" with a little notepad.exe intervention?

[12:20:38] <Haohmaru> anyway, thanks
[12:20:40] <geirha> are you trying to push to the master branch? gitlab disallows that by default
[12:21:04] <Haohmaru> not sure, i'm pressing the same buttons as for my other project where it "works"
[12:22:43] <Haohmaru> if i understand the "gitlab project members" i've not added myself there at all
[12:22:43] <geirha> perhaps your manual edit of .git/config wasn't completely correct then
[12:23:43] <Haohmaru> yeah, in the other project i'm there as "developer"
[12:24:15] <Haohmaru> (forgot to mention, i use two gitlab accounts, one @home, one here @job)
[12:24:45] <cbreak> each account is associated with a number of ssh keys
[12:24:49] <cbreak> be sure you use the correct one
[12:24:55] <Haohmaru> *shrug*
[12:25:07] <cbreak> if you use an ssh agent, ssh-add -l will list the keys stored in it
[12:25:09] <Haohmaru> it "works" for the other project

[13:44:41] <Guest74> hi there I have a question about git
[13:44:41] <Guest74> I have a ".env" file that is in .gitignore file
[13:44:42] <Guest74> and i want this file have different content in two branches
[13:44:42] <Guest74> how should i do this?
[13:45:57] <BtbN> You don't. If it's in gitignore, git ignores it.
[13:46:09] <BtbN> If you want it to be tracked, don't ignore it.
[13:47:07] *** Parts: henk (~henk@leonardo.netwichtig.de) (WeeChat 2.3)
[13:47:07] <Guest74> no idont want to be tracked but i need to this file have different content in 2 branches
[13:47:18] <BtbN> That's not something you can do, no
[13:48:04] <Guest74> ex : in 'dev' branch .env file should contain development environment configs and in 'docker' branch  ' .env ' file should contain docker configs
[13:48:24] <Soliton> why do you want it ignored?
[13:48:34] <BtbN> If the file is not tracked by git, checking out a different branch will not affect it whatsoever
[13:48:46] <BtbN> so, the answer to that is simply that it's not possible
[13:49:02] <Guest74> cuz i dont want people in github see my real environment configs
[13:49:06] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[13:49:13] <Guest74> ok what if i remove it from .gitignore
[13:49:22] <BtbN> Then you add it and commit it in each branch
[13:49:26] <BtbN> and it will also show up on github
[13:49:31] <Guest74> am i able to merge 'dev' and 'master' branch without changing .env file ?
[13:49:57] <BtbN> You can do whatever you like when merging
[13:50:26] <BtbN> But it really sounds like you should find a proper solution for this, and not this weird hack that's not even possible

[13:53:01] <BtbN> Why are the two branches so disconnected that they need totally different config? That sounds like that "docker" branch is unrelated to the other branches?
[13:53:06] <BtbN> Should probably be a whole other repo?
[13:55:35] <Guest74> you know, cuz my project is dockerize  when i want to add changes to my project instead of rebuilding docker images everytime i change a line of code i want to run my project in my own PC

[13:56:45] <Guest74> is there any better way to do this?
[13:57:24] <BtbN> Use a different file?
[13:58:22] <Guest74> so then i should change '.env' file path to something else in my source code

[14:06:40] <Anunay> Well I can only think of workarounds.
[14:07:02] <BtbN> Still sounds like it should be two different repos if it's that different.
[14:07:13] <BtbN> Or just use a different env file for the docker stuff?
[14:07:32] <Anunay> I think the OP simply wants different environment variables when in development and in production
[14:08:14] <Anunay> while working with node, I'd usually read NODE_ENV and load seperate .env files
[14:08:35] <Guest74> aha BtbN yeah maybe i can create another file like 'docker.env' and rename it to '.env' while builind docker images that sounds nice
[14:08:56] <BtbN> Why does it even have to be just ".env"? That sounds super generic
[14:09:04] <Anunay> I guess you can also use a post checkout  hook to automatically export branch.env file.
[14:10:55] <Anunay> Oh and if you only need the new env when building docker just build with
[14:10:56] <Anunay> docker build -e docker.env .
[14:11:38] <Anunay> wait I think that's for passing them directly, I think you'll have to use --env-file

[21:28:43] <joakimk> Very basic question here: I have a feature branch, which is identical on my PC to its remote. I pulled master and merged master into my branch, and got some conflicts. I was a bit quick to resolve, and got it all messed up so I want to just reset/restore my local branch to as before merge -- i.e. reset to how the branch is on remote
[21:29:03] *** Joins: Shentino (~shentino@user/shentino)
[21:29:41] <joakimk> Should I do something like `git reset --HARD`? I guess the alternative is to just delete my local branch (I have no changes I need to save, just get rid of the bad merge), and then check out the remote branch
[21:30:18] <joakimk> but then I'll need to create a new PR, for the new branch... :-/  Guess `git reset` is precisely the thing here?
[21:31:37] <OMGOMG> i don't see what this has to do with pull requests, but yes, reset --hard does what you want
[21:32:29] <joakimk> I already have a PR on the current branch
[21:32:45] <joakimk> work I'm about to resume. Just needed to merge in master first, right? :)
[21:34:04] <OMGOMG> i like to rebase onto master, but that's a matter of taste
[21:34:05] <mackerman> Deleting a branch and doing a new one is correct in many workflows.
[21:35:36] <joakimk> thanks :)
[21:36:18] <jast> you can just "git reset --hard @{upstream}" btw
[21:36:25] <joakimk> that's what I did :)
[21:36:30] <jast> right
[21:37:02] <joakimk> now I need to merge (or rebase) again -- but get the conflicts right this time

[22:58:32] <fuzzybear3965> But, it just spits out the same commit hash that I'm currently on....

[22:59:06] <fuzzybear3965> I'm not sure what these 3 arguments are.
[22:59:15] <Celelibi> Are you sure you don't want to use git bisect directly?

[23:01:24] <fuzzybear3965> `master` is bad and so is the commit I want to check out.
[23:01:44] <fuzzybear3965> I'm hoping that one in the middle will be good. But, `git bisect` needs to bisect between a good and bad commit.
[23:01:48] <fuzzybear3965> I don't know of any good commits.
[23:03:57] <Celelibi> I'm not sure of the exact syntax, but the extra arguments say something like "include everything reachable from foo but exclude everything reachable from bar" when you have foo ^bar arguments.
[23:04:08] <Celelibi> I guess that's what you're after.
[23:04:47] <Celelibi> "List commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a ^ in front of them."
[23:04:52] <fuzzybear3965> Ohhhhh
[23:04:55] <Celelibi> First line of the man page.
[23:05:32] <fuzzybear3965> So, why doesn't `git rev-list --bisect master` doesn't return the midpoint after` git checkout $(git rev-list master $OLD_COMMIT)`?
[23:05:42] <fuzzybear3965> It returns `$OLD_COMMIT` ....
[23:06:02] <fuzzybear3965> Ah, `git checkout $(git rev-list --bisect master $OLD_COMMIT)`.

[23:09:25] <Celelibi> BTW, fuzzybear3965, you just made me answer the question I was coming to ask. I was looking for a way to use git log to show only a specific sequence of commits. I tried HEAD..myfixes, it was the opposite, myfixes..HEAD. ^^
[23:10:13] <fuzzybear3965> Celelibi how does that work? It excludes what?
[23:10:43] <Celelibi> fuzzybear3965, I guess if you only give a single commit to git rev-list, it will take every commit reachable from this commit. Basically, waking the DAG back to the initial commit.
[23:11:03] <Celelibi> fuzzybear3965, you should read the first few paragraphs of the man git rev-list.
[23:11:03] <gitinfo> fuzzybear3965: the git-rev-list manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-rev-list.html
[23:11:21] <Celelibi> The syntax foo..bar is equivalent to bar ^foo.
[23:11:49] <Celelibi> Meaning it includes all the commits reachable from bar, but excludes every commits reachable from foo.
[23:11:53] <fuzzybear3965> Ahhhh. Thanks!
[23:12:27] <Celelibi> Thinking of it as a set operation really help.

[23:21:33] <Celelibi> Yes, that's why I said it. Before that, I used to think of it as paths in a DAG.
[23:23:38] <fuzzybear3965> Yeah, it's really helpful.
[23:23:42] <fuzzybear3965> I thought like you.
