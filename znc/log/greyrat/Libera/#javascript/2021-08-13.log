[02:07:43] <z1haze> how can I set the UTC offset of a Date() instance? just want a `new Date()` with a specific utc offst. i know I create create a date from string and add the offset but that's not what I need

[02:09:03] <ljharb> z1haze: you can't. don't use Date. use moment, until Temporal is viable, then use that.
[02:09:27] <z1haze> unfortunately i cant. this backend does not support packages like that
[02:09:41] <ljharb> lol what backend doesn't support packages
[02:09:46] <z1haze> salesforce :)
[02:09:48] <ljharb> at any rate, then that means you can't do what you want
[02:09:53] <ljharb> salesforce certainly does
[02:09:58] <ljharb> you just have to bundle them up before you upload your code
[02:09:59] <z1haze> not my platform, sir.
[02:10:15] <ljharb> you can include any packages you want
[02:10:15] <z1haze> nah, this is their own serverside implementation
[02:10:29] <ljharb> yes, and it runs your code inside an SES membrane, i'm quite familiar
[02:10:36] <ljharb> you can include any package you want via bundling
[02:10:38] <z1haze> ive been able to convert some more basic prackages
[02:10:45] <ljharb> i'm confident moment will work.
[02:10:57] <z1haze> ill definitely check it out then, thank you
[02:11:11] <z1haze> but that might be overkill for what im trying, maybe I can ask what im actually trying to do
[02:11:50] <z1haze> I'm working with some rest api that returns hours of operation for each store, and the utc offset for each store. I need to be able to render "now open" or "now closed" based on the current time of day
[02:12:16] <z1haze> so im saying with a date right now, then building the start and end hours from the api data.. i just now need to do that math, but taking ito account the UTC offset given
[02:12:42] <z1haze> so i just subtract the utc hours from my now date?

[06:43:19] <theskillwithin> useEffect(() => { //code here },[])       that empty array at the end is the deps for the effect
[06:43:43] <theskillwithin> so i have it as empty array, so it will only fire on component mount
[06:44:09] <theskillwithin> but you can add variables in there, and the effect will automatically refire when the deps change
[06:44:10] <Slade> right?
[06:44:21] <GreenJello> issue is, the rule is usually helpful, but when it's not, it's confusing and requires an awkward disable comment
[06:44:29] <theskillwithin> theres a eslint rule, thats suggests you add things into that, that u don't need

[07:55:34] <sheetjs> Slade: or workarounds for type systems :P
[07:56:16] <Slade> sheetjs, whats that?
[07:56:32] <sheetjs> flow
[07:56:44] <sheetjs> its like typescript but you can hide type annotations in comments
[07:56:58] <sheetjs> so it allows you to write 100% valid javascript and give type hints
[07:57:08] <Slade> sheetjs, oh you using that much?
[07:57:11] <sheetjs> anyway, there's a limitation where you can't give an object numeric keys
[07:57:44] <sheetjs> so we all colloquially understand that ({ 0x0F: 3 }) is an object with a key "15" and value 3
[07:57:50] <Slade> right now i'm just wishing TS had a realtime component.
[07:57:51] <sheetjs> n> Object.entries({0x0F: 3})
[07:57:52] <jellobot> (okay) [ [ '15', 3 ] ]
[07:58:00] <sheetjs> but flow doesn't like that
[07:58:36] <sheetjs> the sheetjs workaround is to trick it into thinking it's a dynamic key using square brackets
[07:58:48] <sheetjs> n> ({[0x0F]: 3})
[07:58:48] <jellobot> (okay) { '15': 3 }
[07:59:23] <sheetjs> to make it valid ES3 javascript AND valid flow, you need to hide the square brackets in a comment that JS ignores but flow understands
[07:59:27] <sheetjs> which becomes
[07:59:49] <sheetjs> { /*::[*/0x0F/*::]*/: 3 }
[07:59:54] <Slade> i'm not sure this is solving any new problems except that its es3 compatible
[08:00:18] <sheetjs> "it would be terrible if you could get it so that 30%+ of your codebase were disable statements for specific lines ;P"
[08:00:53] <Slade> sheetjs, ah! you were responding o something differnt than i thought you were.. haha :P
[08:00:55] <sheetjs> https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/master/bits/77_parsetab.js#L3 more than 1200 lines of workaround because flow doesn't accept numeric keys
[08:01:27] <sheetjs> tbf with syntax highlighting, your eyes gloss over that noise
[08:01:58] <Slade> regarding ts. its nice enough.. but i really think JS really just needs a solid data pattern matching extension, and it goes mostly obsolete   <-- i thought you were responding to this.
[08:02:27] <sheetjs> TS needs a way to hide type annotations in comments
[08:03:06] <Slade> why? so you can avoid transpiling?
[08:03:48] <sheetjs> or to allow for a transition for non-typescript code
[08:03:57] *** Joins: Rockwood_ (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[08:04:33] <Slade> and here i'm thinking about typescripting my typescript
[08:05:15] <sheetjs> its weird in a way.  once you introduce transpilation, ES## is no different from coffeescript or typescript or purescript or whatever other compile-to-js language you can imagine
[08:05:30] <Slade> yea

Although Socket.IO indeed uses WebSocket as a transport when possible, it adds some metadata to each packet: the packet type, the namespace and the ack id when a message acknowledgement is needed. That is why a WebSocket client will not be able to successfully connect to a Socket.IO server, and a Socket.IO client will not be able to connect to a WebSocket server (like
[11:35:42] <theskillwithin>  `ws://echo.websocket.org`) either. Please see the protocol specification [here](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-protocol).

[11:38:56] <maret> One thing which I need is to strip any unnecessary data from response, so I only store in an array bare minimum, which is object with 2 properties , which looks like {prop1: boolean, prop2: { foo: string}} (this could be flattened)
[11:40:58] <maret> I am not sure how the fact that I am storing array in first promise and passing to another the function affects memory management. Is there something obvious I could do here?

[11:55:07] <systemfault> maret: Also, it seems like you're doing all the requests serially... which could be slow.
[11:58:06] <maret> systemfault bit hard to say, because in practice I am doing a lot of requests in parallel so I have multiple copies of a the array running across all of these request. The code can passed 6GB in memory because of that( i think).
[11:58:38] <silly> maret, don't you get an error for using await in a non async arrow function?
[11:59:57] <maret> I am thinking to actually simplifying object in array to bare minimum. not sure how reliable https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-sizeof package is , but if I stripped property names  and flattened the object I went from 148 to 76 bytes
[12:00:21] <maret> silly this is pseudo code , so not in practice sorry about that
[12:00:31] <silly> and then, as systemfault said, with... ahh

[20:58:46] <entuland> your end goal seems to prevent a handler you don't own from executing
[20:58:48] <no_gravity> The use case is: Two modules are offering a context menu for elements on my page. One module displays the context menu if the element is grouped. It should be able to say "This element is grouped. Dont trigger the default context menu. I will display the group context menu".
[20:59:09] <ljharb> no_gravity: so why are you using two competing modules
[20:59:12] <no_gravity> entuland: Correct. The group module does not own the other module and vica versa.

[20:59:49] <ljharb> no_gravity: trying to shove them both in your mouth simultaneously is a bug in you, not in the foods
[21:00:01] <no_gravity> But the group module knows more then the default module. It knows about the default module. While the default module does not know about the group module.
[21:00:19] <no_gravity> So the group module should be more powerful and be able to prevent the default module from displaying its context menu.

[21:01:27] <no_gravity> entuland: Are you sure? I would think this is what preventDefault() is for.

[21:03:44] <no_gravity> Yeah. Unfortunately it might be the case that "contextmenu" is not canceable. Lets see...
[21:04:29] <entuland> doesn't matter if it's cancelable or not - if there is a listener for an event, and that event gets risen, that listener's handler will run
[21:04:53] <entuland> you're not after preventing the default action, you're after avoiding the execution of a listener
[21:05:01] <entuland> solution: avoid adding that listener in first place
[21:05:16] <no_gravity> Hmm.. it seems to be cancelable: https://jsfiddle.net/k02cnxgt/
[21:05:18] <entuland> risen? raised?

[21:06:01] <no_gravity> silly_: Hmm... I don't think the group module should mess with other modules listeners by removing them.
[21:07:04] <entuland> eheheh, it's not what they're doing, that's what you should be doing if you don't find a way to prevent that listener from being added - mind you, trying to get your hands on the data you need to remove such a listener could be more complicated than avoiding it getting added in first place
[21:07:15] <no_gravity> That would result in a giant clusterfuck of all modules removing / readding each others event listeners.
[21:07:32] <entuland> correct, and that's why what you're doing is wrong in first place
[21:07:45] <entuland> you shouldn't be using code that adds conflicting listeners
[21:07:52] <no_gravity> entuland: The event listener for the context menu was long added when the group menu kicks in.

[21:08:12] <no_gravity> entuland: The group menu lets the user select multiple elements by ctrl-clicking themn.
[21:08:14] <entuland> check the docs and see if you can prevent the group menu from handling a specific element
[21:08:37] <no_gravity> Then when the user right-clicks a group, the group module shows the group menu.
[21:08:41] <entuland> or whether you can tell it to ignore the events once they've "attached" themselves to it
[21:08:48] <no_gravity> And should prevent the default menu from showing its menu.
[21:09:14] <no_gravity> entuland: Well, I am writing all modules myself. So I can implement it any way I want.
[21:09:20] <no_gravity> The question is what the best approach is.
[21:09:35] <silly_> seems easier to have just one contextmenu thing to handle both situations
[21:09:37] <entuland> the approach is that your handlers should be attached only when you want them to
[21:09:57] <entuland> you shouldn't have code that scans everything and attaches itself everywhere unless you tell it to
[21:10:13] <no_gravity> silly_: Hmm.. yeah, all modules talking to one "item context menu module" could be an option.
[21:10:52] <no_gravity> entuland: That is the way it is. The default module adds its context handler when the item is create. The group module adds its context handler when the item becomes part of a group.

[21:14:47] <entuland> you could as well just "tag" an element in a way that another module would ignore it, but that only works downstream (say, moduleone processes menuone, adds a "moduleone" class to it, moduletwo processes menuone and ignores it because it has class "moduleone" attached to it
[21:14:59] <ljharb> data attribute, not class.
[21:15:00] <no_gravity> silly_: I would make it so the other modules register their menus with it.
[21:15:10] <entuland> yep, data attributes are better
[21:15:50] <silly_> later when you decide to implement an ungroup option, remind my words
[21:15:51] <no_gravity> entuland: Yes, that would also be an option. Tag the element as "no defaul menu please" with something like item.dataSet['noDefaultMenuPlease']=true or alike.
[21:16:13] <entuland> no need to quote that for dataset
[21:16:26] <entuland> but yes, that would work if your code runs in the correct order

[22:42:17] <pulse> why is it still so hacky to detect user agent
[22:42:58] <pulse> why isn't this standardized so i could just go if (useragent === 'ios') { /* do ios specific thing */ }
[22:43:14] <codebam> pulse: you could write a function
[22:43:33] <codebam> if ( getUA === 'ios' ) {}
[22:43:40] <pulse> well, i copied a giant regex from stackoverflow
[22:43:40] <codebam> I mean getUA()
[22:43:45] <pulse> it works but it's hacky

[23:06:25] <onosendi> Anything wrong with an `onClick` in an `<a>`? The event closes a menu. I'm getting: jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions, jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events though
[23:08:08] <onosendi> I'd prefer to detect a router change and close the menu, but the issue with that is if I click on the same link as the current page, nothing happens.

[23:12:59] <buu> I'm not 100% that's true
[23:13:21] <onosendi> buu: yeah, I thought that too, but it does trigger.

[23:14:51] <onosendi> buu: my understanding is, if the <a> link added some interactivity such as opening a dropdown menu, then a role would be necessary for screen readers. However, if it's just closing a menu is it really needed?
