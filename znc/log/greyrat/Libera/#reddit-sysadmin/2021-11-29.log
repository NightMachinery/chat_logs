[02:25:21] <JollyRgrs> nobyk: OH GOOD! I hated accidentally doing it. your only recourse was hoping you didn't do anything after and could just shake it again
[02:25:38] <JollyRgrs> otherwise, your 20 windows are now all out of sync and not layered just as you need (mojang style)
[02:26:12] <JollyRgrs> mine was b/c it always "sticks" at monitor edges before flipping ot the one next to it... so i have to bring it back and get some speed... but then it takes it as a shake

[04:59:37] <Cl0udNinja> and tryin to rotate the z axis while angling the stick in any direction is a killer and makes shit even worse
[04:59:54] <ravioli> which game
[05:00:00] <Cl0udNinja> Mech Warrior 5
[05:00:45] <Cl0udNinja> in fairness, this is the first I've touched a joystick/hotas in like... 20+ years, but I still feel like totally retarded when I try to use it at all
[05:01:01] <ravioli> which hotas
[05:01:11] <Cl0udNinja> Logitech X52
[05:01:27] <ravioli> nice. i have that one too.
[05:01:34] <ravioli> just keep at it.
[05:01:39] <ravioli> it'll start feeling natural.
[05:02:09] <Cl0udNinja> I think my desk setup is affecting it a lot, because I'm not really at a desk, and the joystick sits really high on the table
[05:02:26] <ravioli> yeah the base on that one isn't exactly short either.
[05:02:41] <ravioli> can you raise up the chair?
[05:02:54] <ravioli> the best option obv is mounting them to the chair. there's some 3d printed things on etsy you can get.
[05:03:01] <Cl0udNinja> my 'desk' is a couch and a coffee table with a top that rises up
[05:03:14] <ravioli> ooh yeah
[05:03:15] <ravioli> that'll do it
[05:03:23] <ravioli> get an xbox controller and be done with it

[05:05:05] <Cl0udNinja> I have a hard mousepad and a book :P
[05:05:19] <ravioli> ah
[05:05:30] <ravioli> well hey, keep the hotas. it's good for flight sims if you ever get into them.

[19:49:56] <yuken> PublicWiFi, basically, as I was installing the bolt head of the 510 connector, I sheared the head off - some solder got into the threads and... I used too much force.
[19:50:05] <PublicWiFi> rip
[19:50:21] <PublicWiFi> is the 510 the common vape connector?
[19:50:33] <yuken> PublicWiFi, this is how small we're talking? https://www.varitube.com/assets/images/VT2_1200_measure.jpg
[19:50:38] <yuken> yeah.
[19:50:57] <PublicWiFi> oof
[19:51:07] <PublicWiFi> how did you  manage to shear it
[19:51:11] <PublicWiFi> lemme look to see how these are mounted
[19:51:26] <yuken> PublicWiFi, inside of the connector, thjere's a brass bolt on a spring.
[19:51:27] <PublicWiFi> were you just cranking down on this thing hardcore?
[19:51:32] <yuken> The brass piece you see at the bottom is the nut.
[19:51:34] <PublicWiFi> ah I see it
[19:52:10] <PublicWiFi> yeah looks like you torqued it a lil too hard haha
[19:52:16] <PublicWiFi> s/looks/sounds
[19:52:17] <layer8> PublicWiFi meant: "yeah sounds like you torqued it a lil too hard haha"
[19:52:23] <yuken> You connect positive to the nut on the bottom, negative to either the top rim or a uhhh... whatever that thing is... 
[19:52:25] <yuken> ring terminal.
[19:52:49] <yuken> Just sends current through the cartridge PublicWiFi, and heats it up.

[20:34:54] <badsnappa> how to be inefficient 101
[20:35:12] <badsnappa> that's why you end up with an IT team of 20 instead of 4
[20:35:56] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> so instead of writing down "Helped susy do this, answer was to do y" in a searchable knowledgebase so the next person can do it faster when it inevitably comes up again
[20:35:56] <badsnappa> mind you if you have 20 people all working on tickets, then you need a ticketing system to pickup trends because communication starts getting difficult with teams that size
[20:36:03] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you just yell YOLO and go for it each time
[20:36:36] <badsnappa> no, you make IT discoverable and easy for your end users to use
[20:37:13] <badsnappa> if we get the same request two or three times (which is becomes immediately obvious, because hey, small team), we will solve it by automating the problem away
[20:37:33] <badsnappa> users shouldn't have to configure shit, they login and everything they need is there, good to go
[20:37:52] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> I mean, if you can get your environment to that, that's great. must not be much diversity in configs and requirements
[20:38:31] <badsnappa> we have about 4-5 different configurations; big chunk of it is common to everything
[20:39:18] <badsnappa> ticketing system is a bad smell in a small organisation; every sysadmin book you pickup pretty much suggests rolling one out as the very first thing you do
[20:39:55] <badsnappa> it might be a sensible thing to do if you are inheriting an orgs IT and there are a lot of support requests because what you have inheritted is awful, but medium term aim should be to clean that mess up and negate the need for a ticketing system

[23:12:32] <Hunterkll> use port 69 
[23:12:39] <Hunterkll> erm
[23:12:43] <Hunterkll> how do you think subdomains work?
[23:12:43] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> so i can delegate it to another dns server, and have a webserver on there too
[23:12:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:12:48] <sd> 12<f​elda> Wow the user manual for the SD Formatter was actually updated just recently (July 15, 2021) I'm impressed.
[23:12:50] <Hunterkll> what?
[23:13:00] <Hunterkll> oh, you want to delegate the subdomain to another authoritative nameserver?
[23:13:08] <Hunterkll> so that you hvae that nameserver managing the subdomain's subdomains?
[23:14:11] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> yes, and also have it able to route the subdomain so you can do stuff like "http://subdomain.domain.com" but also it can do y.subdomain.com -> 1.2.3.4 at the same time
[23:14:26] <Hunterkll> .... what?
[23:14:32] <Hunterkll> route....?
[23:14:56] <Hunterkll> just add NS records to subdomain.domain.com 
[23:15:09] <Hunterkll> then create a zone on the other DNS server the NS records are pointing to, called subdomain.domain.com 
[23:15:21] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> Yeah
[23:15:23] <Hunterkll> then treat it as if it were a regular domain.com 
[23:15:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> fyi royal TS is 50% off
[23:15:43] <Hunterkll> add a host record for Y in that zone, then y.subdomain.domain.com will work 
[23:17:44] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> And if i wanted a host record for subdomain.domain.com
[23:18:06] <Hunterkll> do the same thing you'd do for domain.com's zone
[23:18:27] <Hunterkll> think of it like this - even domain.com is actually a delegated subdomain
[23:18:29] <Hunterkll> of com 
[23:18:35] <Hunterkll> which is a delegated subdomain of . 
[23:18:46] <Hunterkll> it's subdomains all the way down
[23:18:57] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> so my host record of subdomain.domain.com I would have to put in the parent nameserver of domain.com
[23:19:03] <Hunterkll> .,..... no
[23:19:05] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> as well as the forwarders for the subdomain zone
[23:19:12] <Hunterkll> on domain.com you'd add an A record for @ 
[23:19:18] <Hunterkll> you're not adding forwarders
[23:19:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Hunterkill that's pretty normal stuff for hosted websites.
[23:19:23] <Hunterkll> you're just adding nameserver records
[23:19:34] <Hunterkll> telling clients where to go for the records
[23:19:35] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I think at least
[23:19:53] <Hunterkll> so in subdomain.domain.com's zone file, you'd add an A record for @ with whatever IP you want subdomain.domain.com to resolve
[23:20:13] <Hunterkll> bdenlinger what is ?
[23:20:19] <Hunterkll> nothing here is related to hosted sites at all

[23:20:50] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> one sec going back to docs and testing now
[23:20:52] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> thanks hunter
[23:20:57] <Hunterkll> like i said
[23:21:05] <Hunterkll> 'domain.com' is itself just a delegated subdomain
[23:21:10] <Hunterkll> of .com.
[23:21:26] <Hunterkll> so imagine it's subdomain.com instead of subdomain.domain.com 
[23:21:29] <Hunterkll> works the same way
[23:22:22] <sd> 12<f​elda> can you layer more subdomains?
[23:22:59] <Hunterkll> sure
[23:23:00] <Hunterkll> why not?
[23:23:45] <Hunterkll> as long as it's limited to 253 total characters
[23:23:54] <Hunterkll> which gives you a theroetical maximum of 127 labels
[23:23:57] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> I think my issue comes back to this: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c/
[23:24:00] <Hunterkll> a.b.c.d.e.f.g. etc
[23:24:09] <Hunterkll> well lsure
[23:24:12] <Hunterkll> if you delegate subdomain.com 
[23:24:18] <Hunterkll> er, if you delegate subdomain.domain.com
[23:24:25] <Hunterkll> then subdomain.domain.com is the zone's root
[23:24:28] <Hunterkll> so you can't cname it
[23:24:33] <Hunterkll> only host records and the like
[23:24:50] <Hunterkll> think of subdomain.domain.com and domain.com as equals, instead of one being under the other, at this point
[23:25:01] <Hunterkll> they're both independantly managed and they're both the root of their respective zone files
[23:26:39] <sd> 04<u​ltimation> thanks
[23:27:08] <Hunterkll> like i said
[23:27:13] <Hunterkll> remember domain.com is just a delegated subdomain
[23:27:21] <Hunterkll> so subdomain.domain.com and domain.com function identically
[23:27:32] <Hunterkll> it's just one label deeper is all
