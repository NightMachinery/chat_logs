[00:15:01] <evilgohan2> Okay, this is an all too common error
[00:15:30] <evilgohan2> Don't conflate the first amendment which grants persons within America freedom from the government limiting the speech of individuals
[00:15:43] <evilgohan2> with freedom from consequences for such speech
[00:15:55] <evilgohan2> Likewise, don't conflate the first amendment with an absolute freedom of speech.
[00:16:06] <evilgohan2> No one is absolutely required to platform your speech.
[00:17:38] <evilgohan2> In example, if you run a website (or, given the circumstances, an IRC channel / network), no interpretation of "freedom of speech" requires you to provide a platform for anyone and everyone.
[00:17:45] <joepie91> it's kinda staggering how many USians don't realize that the amendments only apply to the government to begin with
[00:17:58] <joepie91> like, in general
[00:18:13] <evilgohan2> Concurrently, no interpretation of freedom of speech inhibits you from removing someone from said "platform" if you don't like what they have to say, or don't want to platform it.

[00:19:21] <imMute> evilgohan2: I'd say Section 230 is more important in that situation than the 1st ammendment.
[00:19:42] <evilgohan2> joepie91: I believe that, in a lot of cases, they know exactly what they're doing and are being disengenous if they say otherwise. Perhaps a few years ago, maybe I would have stood for the argument that they didn't know that it only applied to the government, but it's been hashed out so much by this point that anyone doing so is arguing in bad faith at this point.
[00:20:56] <joepie91> evilgohan2: oh, the ones shouting about it loudly, sure. but there are also many people who aren't loud about it but genuinely seem to believe they are universal laws
[00:20:58] <evilgohan2> imMute: first, Section 230 could not exist without the first amendment. Second, I must reiterate that I was using "platform" in an extremely generic sense. In example, if I have a physical storefront and I give someone space within it to speak about something they wish to, then I have given that person a platform.
[00:24:56] <skye0> feeling like i can't trust anyone IRL because of anti-vax BS btw
[00:25:32] <evilgohan2> Understandable. I've been holding that feeling since 2016, and I already had extreme trust issues then to begin with.
[00:25:47] <skye0> feel like that's gonna start infecting them faster than COVID-19 and Omicron could, and once they're infected by that rhetoric, i'm fucked, our hospitals will be fucked

[00:27:13] <skye0> they stole the name of a group that actually fought against nazis. these new 2020 fuckers are cowards who get offended by people wearing masks and bully them into taking them off
[00:27:23] <sarnold> skye0: your hospitals are already fucked; they're begging staff to work extra shifts, they're canceling vacations, and they're intending to lay off the ~10% of unvaccinated staff soon. I wonder if they'll follow through..
[00:27:38] <skye0> like, that's the same energy as telling men to not wear dresses and Muslim women to take off their hijabs/niqabs
[00:27:48] <evilgohan2> for about 2 weeks of January, we functionally had no ambulances. They were all backed up at hospitals unable to offload covid patients.
[00:28:03] <evilgohan2> (and the last week of December)
[00:28:28] <skye0> apparently omicron's less bad but i'm not sure if i should get my hopes up. at least a good amount of people are already vaccinated
[00:28:36] <evilgohan2> okay, another thing
[00:28:43] <evilgohan2> That "less bad" and "milder" rhetoric
[00:28:51] <skye0> gender issues are also why i'm not very keen with my job
[00:29:05] <evilgohan2> That was the biggest mistake ever put it related to the omicron variant
[00:29:23] <skye0> i did try to make it clear to them that it could always get worse
[00:29:30] <evilgohan2> it was worse to begin with
[00:30:06] <evilgohan2> that "milder" statement was predicated upon a virus sweeeping through South Africa which has a much younger population relative to other locations, and whom had already been devasted by Delta - but that gave them a fairly recent natural immunity.

[00:31:57] <skye0> i'll say their attitude towards the virus has become more... ambivalent as of recent just because it's been around for too long. i still anticipate it'll go away in a decade as opposed to any time soon
[00:32:20] <evilgohan2> if 10 of every 1000 people get sick enough to be hospitalized, and 10000 get sick, 100 people go to the hospital. This is basic.
[00:32:49] <evilgohan2> If 10 of every 20000 get sick enough to be hospitalized, but 1,000,000 people a day are getting sick, guess what? lmao
[00:33:41] <imMute> skye0: the spanish flu (the last major pandemic from 100 years ago) is *still* around today.  why do you think COVID is going away in a decade?
[00:33:55] <skye0> the longer this goes on the more people will get complacent. the longer people get complacent with denying the virus or trying to live as if no pandemic, sorry, "plandemic"/"scamdemic" existed, the more hospitals suffer. the more hospitals suffer, the more people suffer or even die, and the further workers are pushed to their limits
[00:33:59] <evilgohan2> We had and missed our chance to  get rid of COVID
[00:34:08] <skye0> absolutely
[00:34:12] <evilgohan2> It's rapidly becoming endemic.
[00:34:28] <skye0> well it is a pandemic
[00:34:33] <sarnold> evilgohan2: hmm, I would have thought that happened a year ago, or more, no?
[00:36:01] <skye0> i could go on. it'll mean the fall of civilization but those on top stay on top just because they can afford to isolate themselves and get the proper healthcare with expensive systems and treatments generally unavailable to the public. well, it'll be more akin to the plague back in medieval times that wiped out about half of humanity but less extreme
[00:36:16] <evilgohan2> sarnold: My understanding is that if Delta had burned out as the primary variant, and instead became endemic in limited regions (like MERS did), that it might have been endemic to specific regions.
[00:36:38] <skye0> it'll mean a rapid restructuring of society perhaps but at this point at the cost of millions of lives who died from the virus and millions more risking their lives and livelihoods helping people not die from it
[00:36:50] <sarnold> evilgohan2: ahhh, okay, I think I get what you mean

[00:41:57] <evilgohan2> You have a two-fold problem
[00:42:30] <evilgohan2> 1. That too many people have bought into the current system of power, and actually promote it because they believe that they can reach that level some day - and then engage in the same level of exploitation themselves.

[00:59:09] <skye0> they need to be shallower, like the flu. if they want to be right with COVID being "just the flu", they better start working towards it
[00:59:35] <skye0> it will last years no thanks to idiots. yes, scientific institutions haven't been that great but knowledge has been stolen from its original discoverers, like how men often take credit for women's work

[01:05:52] <skye0> let me say that my mother was a... pragmatic over recent attitudes to COVID (I don't want to get into details especially since I still have to live with parents while I still can't move out) - the longer this does go on, the more people will just try to shrug it off especially with some people trying to promote the whole herd immunity thing

[19:14:40] <ThePendulum> the woman below that guy might be wearing a mask but it's hard to see through her sieg heil

[19:25:08] <imMute> I'm always worried about that because that's exactly what the anti-vax "do your research!" idiots *think* they're doing.
[19:25:10] <ThePendulum> gdi I can't find that audience shot anymore
[19:25:35] <evilgohan2> imMute: Hmm... perhaps I shoudl have quantified that by saying "think logically" lol

[19:29:24] <ThePendulum> damn my mom couldn't get any sound on her work laptop, that's not surprising, but it does worry me my dad couldn't figure it out either :/ he had computers early on, used to be a programmer, taught me how to use them
[19:31:18] <ThePendulum> it was just in the status bar like it is in pretty much any OS
[19:36:05] <ThePendulum> evilgohan2: yep top right dude is definitely wearing a mask, and the woman isn't

[19:37:18] <ThePendulum> although she seems to be wearing a different mask than it seems like in the first screenshot lol

[19:40:14] <joepie91> <ThePendulum> feels a bit like no true scotsman... I'm not saying they are anti vax because they are left, but they are definitely left leaning in a lot of their other viewpoints

[19:40:22] <joepie91> the 'left-ness' tends to be extremely superficial
[19:41:04] <joepie91> usually in the form of "yeah really we should have equal rights for everybody" but as soon as you try to propose any specific real-world implementations they will immediately dismiss it without even *trying* to narrow it down to something that could work

[22:07:06] <rawktucc> Tumblr is awesome
[22:07:19] <rawktucc> we're actively trying to keep new users off because there's probably gonna be a resurgence in 2022
[22:07:24] <rawktucc> somehow Tumblr has been profitable
[22:07:50] <rawktucc> the level of humour on tumblr is literally unfindable and unmatchable on any other site. I'm really anxious when it inevitably shuts down

[22:11:57] <rawktucc> which part of tumblr are you on
[22:12:00] <rawktucc> the aesthetic part, or the meme part
[22:12:24] <rawktucc> the memes for january have been: nonsense words = funny characters from shows (sarcastically), and plinko horse
[22:12:30] *** Quits: ghavil (~ghavil@user/ghavil) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:12:33] <skye0> i like that Tumblr doesn't succumb to "not all men", "what about the men" etc. Also, it and deviantArt (minus the degeneracy that once dominated those sites, although IDK about dA) are to me what YouTube should have been - a place for fandom
[22:13:24] <skye0> the LGBT discourse part. was once with the fandom and emo aesthetic part. i have complicated reasons for leaving everything but the LGBT discourse part
[22:13:33] <rawktucc> wdym "not all men" and all that? there are some parts that are like that
[22:13:48] <rawktucc> i've never really been on that part of tumblr
[22:13:50] <skye0> youtube shuold have been a place for people to celebrate their favorite games and shows, not try to have to weasel their way constantly to avoid the copyright bots, and not a place to shill VPNs. they can take their VPN shilling to twitch, that place was built from the ground up for monetization
[22:13:50] <rawktucc> i mainly follow memes
[22:14:09] <rawktucc> ok I see tumblr just changed the reblog/like button design
[22:15:46] <skye0> mostly in blogs that get shot down anyway for being "misogynistic". men haven't been that great tbh, and i don't like that i have to be one too. also, my mother thought the LGBT community was engaged in those anti-vax protests in the netherlands
[22:16:05] <rawktucc> I am kind of an asshole tbh
[22:16:18] <skye0> i'm also actively avoiding social networks because i envy some of the people on there, tumblr included, and because i feel too problematic for tumblr
