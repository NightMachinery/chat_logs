[14:05:39] <bill-auger> WDPT? - if some LGPL source-code will not compile, due to missing sources, unless the build environment has an active internet connection and downloads new third-party source-code from a fourth-party service - that seems to fail the CCS requirement, no? 
[14:06:21] <bill-auger> or it has that potential, if the fourth-party service shuts-down, or the third-party project stops publishing to it
[14:10:04] <bill-auger> i think most people agree, that it should be possible to get _somehow_, all source code needed to compile, later offline; but does the GPL require that?

[20:55:28] <jxself> It's still software and still nonfree. It still denies your rights to study, change and share it.
[20:56:34] <jxself> Since it's included in the kernel you're still being given copies of software that denies your rights.
[20:57:22] <tesseract> jxself: but they will just sit in your ssd and they will have no function
[20:58:59] <jxself> You should have the right to inspect all of the code of your operating system, not just the pieces that you use.

[21:00:56] <tpefreedom> GNUHacker, you can still run debian with 100% free software easily. Trisquel might be even better, but it is also more out of date.

[23:32:03] <jxself> I also started doing it for RPM too.
[23:32:27] <belgin> just curious, why do you have to build 100 kernels?
[23:32:48] <belgin> doesn't seem like there are that many combinations
[23:33:11] <jxself> It's a combination of 8 active kernel series, built across all supported CPU architectures.
[23:33:22] <belgin> i see
[23:33:39] <jxself> Well, 7 now I guess since 5.14 is end-of-life. But 5.16 is due next month so it'll be back up to 8 again soon.
[23:34:47] <jxself> For amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, m68k, mipsel, or1k, powerpc, ppc64, ppc64el, riscv64, s390x and sparc64
[23:35:01] <belgin> i have a d16 too. just so you know, mdeb is trying to re-add it to coreboot. it was removed a couple of years ago because of lack of maintainers
[23:35:02] <jxself> And i386 counts twice since I build PAE and non-PAE kernels.
[23:35:15] <jxself> I'd love to see the D16 be supported again.
[23:36:41] <jxself> I didn't really mind it being dropped though. That's usually what happens in the world with the proprietary BIOS stuff too: Eventually you stop getting any updates at all. So that in way it was very similar and at least this way it's free software still.
[23:37:04] <jxself> But if it comes back I'll be happy. :)

[23:40:23] <belgin> oh ok
[23:41:52] <jxself> Hold the kernel source code in RAM via tmpfs and do the compiling there to avoid disk delays.

[23:50:19] <jxself> I don't have a lot of laptops, no. The ones I do have did not come from technoethical.
[23:51:25] <jxself> I have an x200, a MacBook 2,1 just because of the irony of running free software on something from Apple. And an X60s. The first to run the 100% free software stack before it was called libreboot. It was installed during one of the libreplanet conferences.

[23:54:11] <belgin> i have a multi-band radio and i set it to MW at 1560 khz, pointed the antenna at my computer, and i can hear the gpu when it's rendering things lol
[23:55:25] <jxself> Your next task is to use that to reconstruct what's being displayed on the screen. :)
[23:55:58] <belgin> that would be an interesting neural network project
