[02:36:56] <Khepra> Wow!   https://relay.firefox.com/
[02:48:44] <styx> Limited-time only: Unlimited aliases for ⁨$0.99⁩ per month
[02:49:01] <styx> so, they are desperate for monetarization
[02:50:10] <styx> Firefox Relay shares information with a third party to provide the service to you.
[02:50:42] <styx> also, the third party is well known for privacy, consumer rights and ... that kind of stuff.. it's Amazon Web Services
[02:52:39] <styx> which means data is most likely processed in the US and everyone under 18 needs to ask their guardian to use Firefox Relay.. just saying
[02:54:22] <Friithian> is this surprising?
[02:54:28] <styx> which part?
[02:54:33] <Friithian> any of it
[02:54:53] <styx> the "If you’re under 18, you may use AWS Offerings only with the involvement of a parent or guardian" is actually news to me
[02:55:14] <Friithian> doesn't really surprise me tbh
[02:55:20] <styx> otherwise, i'd have hoped they'd use someone more trustworthy
[02:56:03] <styx> yes, i take that back.
[02:56:20] <styx> mozilla.org is hosted by AWS and uses GMail as MX

[11:50:13] <styx> Transfers outside of the EEA. When we transfer your personal information outside the EEA we do so in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Notice and applicable data protection law.
[11:50:27] <styx> because they still say they are in accordance to privacy shield
[11:52:30] <styx> they do not claim to not process it in the US - as this would be a great marketing blurb in Europe, most likely they do process in the US.

[13:56:46] <styx> randall, that is why AWS still referring to it is even more absurd
[13:58:24] <styx> i am aware - Max Screms is a fellow Austrian ;)
[13:59:43] <styx> * max Schrems
[14:01:08] <randall> indeed, yeah.
