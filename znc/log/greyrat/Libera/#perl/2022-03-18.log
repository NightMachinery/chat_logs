[01:14:17] <gordonfish> [OT] Is it just me, or are naked (case-less) smart phones too damn slippery (at least from the last few years) ? I always use a nice case on my phones, but when ever I take them out to do something, like change a SIM, I find that I have a LOT less grip, they tend to slide around on smooth surfaces, and I'm always hitting the screen when handling it when it's on.
[01:14:20] *** Joins: FinnElija (~finn_elij@user/finn-elija/x-0085643)
[01:15:49] <gordonfish> It also makes me wonder why phone makers spend so much time designing elaborate back sides when most people put on case on it and you then said back is nearly never seen. I get they want it to look good in ads and all, but it many ways it seems wasteful.

[03:44:13] <Grinnz> plus mild drop protection is nice
[03:44:30] <Grinnz> I've never had a phone break from dropping it, I've been lucky
[03:45:00] <Grinnz> I use phones one handed so grip is important
[03:47:59] <gloin> I had to pay $250 for a new screen on my Pixel less than two weeks after buying it
[03:48:33] <gloin> so actual perl question here: I'm trying to match any line that either is just ^$ or contains only some kind of \s char
[03:48:40] <gloin> can't seem to match both
[03:48:49] <Grinnz> ^\s*$
[03:49:18] * gloin replaces . with * and facepalms
[03:51:51] <gloin> Anyways beware the pixel 6 - it's a decent enough phone except that it is very slippery and also the fingerprint sensor is horrid.
[03:52:21] <Grinnz> I'm avoiding it because there is no small version
[03:52:29] <Grinnz> so the rest of the features don't really matter
[03:52:57] <Grinnz> i forget, did they make that one a screen fingerprint sensor or is there still one on the back?
[03:53:38] <Grinnz> I'm basically hoping for a 6a or 7 that's smaller if I need to upgrade
[03:53:43] <gloin> The non-pro isn't huge, and yeah it's got the on-screen sensor. Feels like gee-whiz tech that should have been dumped at prototype stage.
[03:54:07] <gloin> My previous was a Pixel3a and the fingerprint sensor on it worked very well.
[03:54:18] <Grinnz> yeah, the back sensors have worked great ever since the first pixel
[03:54:32] <Grinnz> annoying that they wouldn't just keep doing that
[03:54:38] <gloin> Used some form of radar rather than optical sensor, if your hands are damp after washing for example the print won't recognize at all.
[03:55:12] <Grinnz> I know it's because people want to fingerprint-unlock without picking up the phone but like... it's not worth it
[03:55:33] <gloin> Or make sure you've tested in real-world environments before deploying as your flagship device.
[03:55:42] <gloin> and, you know, /listened/ to the testers
[03:55:55] <gloin> Tech-bro arrogance never fails to annoy.
[03:56:25] <Grinnz> the 6 non-pro is still much larger than the 5
[03:56:33] <Grinnz> and the 5 is already pushing how big i want my phone to be
[03:56:38] <Grinnz> just no better options
[03:56:48] <gloin> Pay $2500 for a samsung haha
[03:57:31] <Grinnz> gsmarena has rumored dimensionss for the 6a and it's still bigger than the 5 :|

I can see in .c file produced that the prototype set is "$$". OK but why not "@"? My aim is to both allow f(1,2) and f(@x) and at the same time have perl check number of items in array to be 2.

[16:26:20] <Guest4534> Ilmari: I see. Of course my example is actually simplified, I am actually trying to do something like $CARS{ @NEWCARLIST }->{color} = @NEWCARLIST_COLORS;
[16:26:47] <Guest4534> This is why I was thinking about a "slice" of a hash %CARS.
[16:28:13] <simcop2387> use List::Util qw/zip/; for my $pair (zip \@NEWCARLIST, \@NEWCARLIST_COLORS) { $CARS{$pair->[0]} = $pair->[1] }

[16:32:13] <LeoNerd> simcop2387: Also note the existence of `mesh` plays nicely with 5.35.x's new multivariable foreach.    foreach my ($car, $cdr) (mesh \@cars, \@cdrs) { ... }
[16:32:14] <Guest4534> Botje: Thank you for the possible solution, I thought so, too. Was just asking myself if there was something simpler. Why not use "map", btw?

[16:33:33] <ilmari> Guest4534: map is for transforming a list of values into another list of values. using it for side effects inside the block is confusing and considered bad style
[16:34:11] <revhippie> i read about that and my first thought was "foreach @foo[0..49] (@bar) { ... }"
[16:34:32] <Guest4534> I am writing a small, little tool that is to be used interactively on every possible system, including older releases of Linux and Unix with their on-board Perl installation. It should also be as quick as possible. Therefore I refrain mostly from using Libraries and try to be efficient and compatible as possible.
[16:34:44] <LeoNerd> That could have been cute, but rather confusing. For now it only permits a statically-sized list of lexicals
[16:34:50] <LeoNerd> Of *new* lexicals, more's the point

[16:36:17] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: i'm waiting for the whole extension of it in 5.38: my @points = ([1,1,1], ...); my ($x, $y, $z) = ...; my sub somelocalfunction {$x+=1; $y-=1; $z/=2} for dynamically \($x, $y, $z) (@points) { ...; somelocalfunction(); ... }
[16:39:12] <simcop2387> that's only partially tongue in cheek.  i would actually like to see it work with the dynamically stuff.  i know that's a crapton harder than it should be to do though.
