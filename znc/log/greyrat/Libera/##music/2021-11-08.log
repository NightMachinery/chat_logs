[00:29:16] <Panther> They need a special lane for them, like the express lane for 10 or fewer, there is a RIP lane for dead only.
[00:30:24] <Panther> Jung was prolly right then, cuz he must be analyzing the crap out of himself, and he ain't revived yet. :)
[00:35:00] <TXDillo> kewl, morlog
[00:35:34] <edgar-rft> Jung analyzed himself to death, why would he want to be revived?

[02:58:08] <morlog> my knee hurts pretty bad now
[02:58:27] <hype> Good morning.
[02:58:35] <morlog> how goes
[03:00:14] <morlog> missing the drum circle tonight
[03:00:50] <LibertyDillo> what happened to your knee?
[03:01:35] <morlog> when that guy tried to kick the door open I put my foot down and lifted up my toes to stop them from being able to open the door
[03:01:45] <morlog> i have traing for stuff like that
[03:02:08] <LibertyDillo> hope it heals quickly
[03:02:24] <morlog> when someone is trying to kick your door in you step back and put yout oes up on one foot with your heel on the ground
[03:02:33] <morlog> will stop the door dead
[03:02:41] <LibertyDillo> good technique
[03:02:45] <morlog> will be ok in a couple days
[03:03:05] <morlog> keeps you from being smacked in the face and being stunned by the door
[03:03:08] <LibertyDillo> makes it kinda difficult to pedal though :/
[03:03:46] <morlog> would hurt more if i walked everywhere
[03:04:04] <LibertyDillo> true, walking is much more jarring
[03:04:47] <morlog> that guy probably weighed in at 180 and i only weigh 120
[03:05:17] <morlog> maybe 125 now
[03:05:26] <LibertyDillo> skinny fellow
[03:05:28] <morlog> i go between 120 and 130 
[03:05:44] <morlog> im 120, he was about 180
[03:05:49] <morlog> im the skinny one
[03:05:55] <circuitbone> rub some corn on that knee
[03:05:57] <LibertyDillo> that's what I meant

[06:56:12] <Janet> ^ Marconi Union - Strata - YouTube
[06:56:20] <louipcD> what about women indians
[06:56:23] <Panther> Captain: All right! All right! (into the PA) this is your captain speaking... do not rush for the lifeboats ... women, children, Red Indians, spacemen (stock film of long shot of sinking vessel, the voice over fading) and a sort of idealized version of complete Renaissance Men first!
[06:58:06] <Panther> Personally, I think rushing for the lifeboats is a great idea.
[06:58:58] <Panther> They don't make return trips.
[07:02:28] <Panther> On April 28, near the island of Tonga, Christian and 25 petty officers and seamen seized the ship. Bligh, who eventually would fall prey to a total of three mutinies in his career, was an oppressive commander and insulted those under him. By setting him adrift in an overcrowded 23-foot-long boat in the middle of the Pacific, Christian and his conspirators had apparently handed him a death 
[07:02:28] <Panther> sentence. By remarkable seamanship, however, Bligh and his men reached Timor in the East Indies on June 14, 1789, after a voyage of about 3,600 miles. 
[07:03:10] <Panther> So, I think at least one crewman, and at least 1-3 other men ought to be in the lifeboats with the women and children.

[08:12:23] <Panther> In the war between the two tribes of gods, Odin led the Aesir gods into battle against the Vanir. He began the battle by hurling his spear over the enemy host and crying, “Óðinn á yðr alla!” (“Odin owns all of you!”).

[20:01:36] <murthy> Worth a portrait
[20:02:49] <murthy> People are telling me that La Nina can happen here in December, so I am going to prep good
[20:03:12] <morlog> that means mild weather
[20:03:55] <morlog> supposed to do that here to
[20:04:14] <murthy> idk, sounds scarey

[20:05:01] <morlog> im liking this playlist that youtube has me on
[20:05:21] <louipc00D> what is it
[20:05:22] <murthy> morlog: also did the utilities in Texas finish weather proofing?
[20:05:33] <morlog> probably not
[20:05:38] <murthy> :(
[20:05:52] <morlog> they are required by law now to inspect them regularly now
[20:06:21] <murthy> I don't understand the impact of that
[20:06:35] <murthy> Only weather would prevent such incidents
[20:06:37] <morlog> means that they should catch issues sooner
[20:06:44] <murthy> Weather proofing
[20:06:52] <morlog> there is more to it than just inspections
[20:06:54] <artao> foggy mornings are pretty
[20:07:03] <murthy> artao: yes
[20:07:05] <morlog> thats the thing murthy 
[20:07:07] <artao> or rather, can be
[20:07:16] <morlog> texas weather usually doesnt get like that
[20:07:25] <murthy> artao: was calm but just the crows asking for food
[20:07:45] <morlog> adding the heating elements to the windmills and gas lines is cost porohibitive
[20:07:46] <artao> especially with everything covered in hoar frost from the fog freezing
[20:08:08] <artao> super dangerous to drive in, but very beautiful. especially with that almost electric blue morning light
[20:08:10] <morlog> would require completely rebuilding the windmills and quite a bit of construction on the gas lines
[20:08:18] <murthy> morlog: ya I can understand but afaik there is no way other than weather proofing
[20:08:42] <murthy> I feel like Texas is going to get another vortox thing
[20:08:51] <morlog> yeah, i think they are mainly focusing on the gas lines, they froze up during those storms
[20:08:53] <murthy> morlog: yes indeed
[20:09:09] <morlog> its what allmost caused the grid to fail completely
[20:09:17] <murthy> Yes
[20:09:22] <artao> when the poles flip the equator will become the freezing area
[20:09:22] <artao> hehe
[20:09:33] <morlog> the windmills right now are more used as a secondary power source
[20:09:39] <morlog> here
[20:09:47] <morlog> hoping that will change
[20:10:18] <murthy> artao: here we have an extremely thick vegetation and a huge population of birds
[20:10:30] <morlog> hackaday did a really good writeup on the whole thing
[20:10:36] <murthy> artao: just felt like a micro Papua guenie
[20:10:40] <murthy> :)
[20:11:04] <artao> we also have thick vegetation and many birds ... just different types
