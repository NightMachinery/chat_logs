[21:14:50] <Kiernian> some downloader, IIRC
[21:15:32] <bomb> ah
[21:15:32] <bomb> https://freetubeapp.io/
[21:16:00] <sideup66> youtube client on android
[21:16:02] <sideup66> ad free and the like
[21:16:23] <bomb> that's cool
[21:16:43] <bomb> I use Firefox + YT website for that, I should try this Vance thing
[21:16:54] <sideup66> it just got discontinued
[21:17:03] <monr0e> Vanced is good. Can lock and still play.
[21:17:30] <Kiernian> I can do that with firefox and the website last I checked
[21:18:03] <bomb> yeah, Firefox Mobile runs uBlock Origin addon to block ads
[21:18:08] <monr0e> I use FF Focus, so no extensions
[21:18:18] <monr0e> and it forgets my autoplay settings. 
[21:20:55] <Kiernian> why would you choose to run a hobbled version of firefox?
[21:21:32] <monr0e> no tracking, no cookies, no bullshit
[21:21:59] <monr0e> I do want extensions though, so I can nuke gdpr popups. Soon apparently
[21:26:32] <bomb> someone should develop an AI addon that hides "sponsored" website articles , YouTube videos, and such.
[21:32:45] <sideup66> ill need to go in later
[21:32:53] <sideup66> and figure out in android if theres a way to pull a installed apk file out
[21:33:02] <sideup66> so i can just archive and install if i ever erase the phone
[21:33:18] <sideup66> old client should continue to work for a while
[21:33:27] <sideup66> unless google decides to figure out the client and serverblock it
[21:34:24] <monr0e> archived apk should be n /etc somewhere
[21:34:31] <monr0e> i forget wwhere
[21:45:48] <sideup66> yeah kinda busy atm, ill look it up in a bit when im home
[21:45:59] <sideup66> but yeah wtf
[21:53:01] <riff-IRC> waitwhat??
[21:54:08] <sideup66> yeah
[21:54:13] <sideup66> youtube vanced is dead
[21:54:20] <sideup66> theyre gonna be pulling everything down soon
[21:54:24] <bomb> why did they kill it?
[21:54:35] <sideup66> all they cite are "legal reasons outside their control"
[21:54:37] <sideup66> my logic being
[21:54:44] <sideup66> they got a Cease and Desist from Google
[21:54:55] <sideup66> basically we sue you off the face of the earth
[21:54:58] <sideup66> or you kill your app
[21:55:15] <bomb> it's open-source, they could continue publishing on F-Droid
[21:56:44] <riff-IRC> It's probably been forked 4 zillion ways from Sunday
[21:56:55] <sideup66> i think so
[21:56:58] <sideup66> though some stuff is missing
[21:57:04] <sideup66> because its literally a hacked version of stock youtube
[21:57:16] <sideup66> with sponsor block, no ads, dislike button put back, and a bunch of other stuff
[21:57:23] <sideup66> my guess is google wasnt amused and they got too greedy
[21:57:32] <riff-IRC> yea
[21:57:53] <sideup66> they started doing stupid stuff like NFTs and all too supposedly
[21:57:55] <sideup66> which i mean
[21:57:58] <sideup66> if your a piracy group
[21:58:05] <bomb> is it a true Android app, or a WebView hack?
[21:58:05] <sideup66> its not wise to draw that much mainstream attention
[21:58:17] <sideup66> it is the stock youtube app, but heavily modified basically
[21:58:56] <riff-IRC> kinda like a prebuilt pc converted to a gaming system running *nix

[21:59:19] <bomb> buh buh Google was a Silicon Valley saint, and they luv developers??
