[02:36:00] <OmarZeghouani[m]> hey does anyone get any error from `highlight.lua` when using eslint?
[02:36:35] <lainon_[m]> if you're using highlight.lua you should probably upgrade to treesitter
[02:36:43] <OmarZeghouani[m]> `if start[2] < 0 or finish[1] < start[1] then return end` line 33, function `highlight.range`
[02:37:06] <OmarZeghouani[m]> hmm when I disable eslint its not an issue, why would it be treesitter?
[02:37:07] * lainon_[m] uploaded an image: (41KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UPTNRRHpvWmNUZjBINAzVuom/image.png >
[02:37:14] <lainon_[m]> https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter
[02:37:23] <lainon_[m]> install treesitter and see if you run into the same issue
[02:37:43] <OmarZeghouani[m]> im talking about `highlight.lua` from the nvim runtime files
[02:37:48] <OmarZeghouani[m]> `/usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/highlight.lua` to be exact
[02:38:10] <lainon_[m]> oh fuck knows then LMFAO 
[02:39:13] <lainon_[m]> sorry
[02:40:22] <OmarZeghouani[m]> it seems like only happens when there are two signs on the same line.

[03:14:53] <mjlbach[m]> This is what is said in the issue template "Note that this repository implements configuration and initialization of language servers. Implementation of the language server spec itself is located in the neovim core repository." Could this be worded in a better way?

[15:26:04] *** Joins: AsenMx (~AsenMx@user/asenmx)
[15:26:07] <clason[m]> don't lazy-load unless a) the plugin takes an extraordinary amount of time during startup and b) you know you most likely won't use it 
[15:26:13] <clason[m]> the lazy-loading
[15:26:49] <clason[m]> also, Packer does _not_ (and cannot) "load plugins" -- that is what Neovim does during startup.
[15:27:03] <clason[m]> So this is expected behavior
[15:27:32] <Binx[m]> clason[m]: Isn't that what `PackerLoad` can do though?
[15:28:07] <clason[m]> that just does `packadd` (plus whatever config you have)
[15:28:20] <clason[m]> but if they're already loaded, it can't _re_load
[15:28:27] <Binx[m]> Oh, I see
[15:28:51] <gaarco[m]> so lazy load is pretty much useless?
[15:28:58] <clason[m]> depends on what for
[15:29:04] <clason[m]> it's definitely _over_used

[23:14:19] <aphysically> okay I Think I'm making progress :D
[23:14:34] <aphysically> I think I need to do something like "hi def link somethinghere Delimiter" and I"m messing with playground to see if it can give a hint what somethinghere could be
[23:16:16] <aphysically> https://i.imgur.com/p5HKqvW.png hmm
[23:23:49] <aphysically> oooo I think maybe I figured it out, it's that the vim syntax itself for python doesn't mark delimiter groups
[23:24:31] <aphysically> and neither does rust maybe?
[23:25:43] <clason[m]> could be
[23:25:51] <clason[m]> no syntax groups, no highlight groups

[23:31:27] <unclechu> Hey, how does vim detects whether it’s running in a terminal or not?
[23:31:59] <unclechu> Like if I get this warning: “Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal”
[23:32:06] <unclechu> What does this tell me?
[23:32:29] <unclechu> nvim though starts fine
[23:32:51] <unclechu> I try to run in from another program. From some REPL.
[23:34:40] <aphysically> anyway, a way to just not have the highlight groups fight with each other would be a good start probably
[23:37:37] <Bowuigi[m]> <unclechu> "Hey, how does vim detects..." <- It checks if stdout is a tty with the isatty function
[23:37:42] <clason[m]> yeah, sorry, no can do right now. it's either one, or the other, or a fight to the death
[23:37:50] <Bowuigi[m]> That is the usual way at least
[23:38:13] <unclechu> Bowuigi[m]: Can I somehow trick it or force it to run anyway?
[23:45:01] <Bowuigi[m]> <unclechu> "Can I somehow trick it or..." <- Yeah, but it requires some knowledge about PTYs and only works on Linux and BSD
[23:45:02] <aphysically> fight fight fight
[23:45:47] <Bowuigi[m]> What
[23:47:05] <Bowuigi[m]> Usually languages use a "system" or "execute" function  that grabs the stdout and don't let you use the stdin
[23:47:21] <Bowuigi[m]> So yeah, starting nvim from a REPL is a no no

[23:54:14] <ii14[m]> you can use --headless
[23:55:01] <ii14[m]> it depends on the repl I guess, your shell is technically a repl too

[23:57:09] <Bowuigi[m]> Yeah maybe
