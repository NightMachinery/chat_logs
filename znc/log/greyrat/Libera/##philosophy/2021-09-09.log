[00:17:58] <omero> what I meant was: how philosophical is the matter of 'let us kill IRC and why it is relevant'
[00:18:51] <causative> free speech is an important subject in political philosophy
[00:19:01] <causative> it's in the public interest to use chat services that the government cannot shut down
[00:19:06] <omero> wouldnt that amount of hammering onto the very foots/roots/foundations of this very channel?
[00:20:00] <omero> and even so. I fail to see how easy would be to hammer down IRC as a whole.
[00:20:27] <omero> I am not saying it isnt possible of course.
[00:20:53] <omero> but allow me to disagree on the 'easily' word/concept.
[00:21:51] <causative> IRC is client-server architecture, the government can shut down the servers
[00:22:02] *** Quits: deksar (~deksar@user/deksar) (Quit: Going offline, see ya!)
[00:22:07] <causative> it's not even encrypted
[00:22:33] <Panther> They can't shut my IRC servers down.
[00:22:46] <causative> why is that?
[00:22:50] <Panther> I have compiled IRC servers on every OS possible, just about.
[00:22:52] <omero> ok. time for some humorous explanation : https://xkcd.com/1782/
[00:22:52] <ro-bot-o> [url] xkcd: Team Chat | xkcd.com
[00:23:29] <Panther> I have the source code, and I have also woekrd on it, so although I likely couldn't recode it from scratch, I know a great deal about how it works.
[00:23:48] <Panther> I made the channel and oper services the network I work on uses, also.
[00:24:32] <Panther> I could code a chat server very much like an IRC server from scratch, tho it would take a littlw while.
[00:24:34] <omero> the galactic singularity _might try_ but nope. its that one guy that resists and keeps IRC what it is ;)
[00:24:50] <Panther> I guess they could try to kill me.
[00:25:08] <causative> it doesn't matter if you have the IRC software to set up a server, if no one knows about that server
[00:25:13] <omero> I guess I will never be alone on IRC Panther ;)
[00:25:20] <Panther> Or imprison.. sentenced to life in prison for making an IRC aserver.
[00:25:23] <causative> the government could easily shut down the major IRC networks and kill 99% of IRC activity
[00:25:37] <causative> your home server hosting you and your cat, they don't care so much about
[00:25:38] <Panther> Then they will come to the new ones that spring up.
[00:25:59] <omero> again, causative ... its the 'easily' word/concept that is quite ... disturbing
[00:26:10] <causative> there's always a lag in getting people on a new network
[00:26:23] <Panther> Really... I am 100% serious.. if you want to kill IRC, you are going to have to do it over my dead body. :P
[00:26:26] <causative> and if you widely advertise your servers and become popular enough to attract notice, they'll just shut you down
[00:26:34] <Panther> Which I won't make easy.
[00:26:46] <omero> causative: let me ask. what is your interest in 'easily shutting down IRC'
[00:27:39] * omero eyes causative with narrow eyes
[00:27:53] <causative> I already told you
[00:28:20] <Panther> An IRC 'network' is an extremely intangible thing. However, you don't have to worry yourselves. I won't let the government do this in the first place.
[00:28:26] <omero> care to repeat? I have probably missed that part, causative
[00:28:36] <causative> <causative> free speech is an important subject in political philosophy
[00:28:36] <causative> <causative> it's in the public interest to use chat services that the government cannot shut down
[00:29:09] <omero> uhm ... ok... I will ponder over those lines causative
[00:29:39] <omero> in other words, I need some time to to think
[00:30:18] <omero> I am still curious how that is a problem. easily a problem.
[00:30:26] <causative> that means:  it should be peer-to-peer, not client-server; it should be encrypted, such that the govt cannot know who is talking to whom or what they are saying; the traffic should be disguised through a VPN and/or steganography so the govt has a hard time figuring out who is using the service and who is not
[00:30:45] <omero> ok. now its clear.

[12:12:54] <DPA> A crime is any unlawful activity, regardless of social or moral merits / societal understandings of the matter. Hate is a strong aversion against someone, something, or an action, usually with a wish it wouldn't be. It may also sometimes be enough to motivate actions against the thing being hated.
[12:21:02] <DPA> A hate crime is an action deemed to be made due to an aversion to something, which is considered unlawful, usually because it is considered to cause harm of some sort to some person or group, but that could be anything, even just the expression of a disliking of something, or critique against anything.
[12:28:26] <DPA> I think hating things isn't always bad. There are things like DRM, systemd, current intellectual property rights, etc. which I think have a negative impact on the world & in the end cause harm to people, and thus shouldn't exist or be significantly changed. It is good to hate these things.

[12:46:04] <arcturus> it requires premeditation i think

[19:31:25] <audrey> brigand: I don´t follow news much at all now, especially since my job no longer requires it
[19:31:40] <audrey> developing a distaste for journalism in general as it is practiced today
[19:32:02] <audrey> I didn´t think of Twitter as a news source though, that´s interesting
[19:32:22] <audrey> Sort of a «straight from the horse´s mouth» situation, I suppose, i.e. itś better for firsthand reports
[19:36:54] <audrey> I usually associate Twitter with exceedingly bad, oversimplified takes on complicated social and geopolitical issues
[19:37:12] <audrey> and screeching activists from across the political spectrum gunning for their talking points
[19:37:30] <spruit11> twitter is what you make of it.  you can choose to follow only diplomats,  journalists,  scientists,  or influencers
[19:37:42] <audrey> IDK, maybe I expect too much from the discourse these days
[19:37:52] <pussipupu> it's not a spectrum it's a manifold grumble grumble
[19:38:23] <audrey> I like the Financial Times, Kommersant, Le Monde Diplomatique, and occasional doses of substack writers, Quillette et al.
[19:38:34] <audrey> Twitter seems like a low effort kind of environment, frankly.
[19:38:37] <spruit11> following pretty girls turned out to be a bad idea for me though. a few clicks and your entire timeline is full of women feeling 'cute'
[19:39:13] <audrey> Yeah, also narcissistic. Which I guess social media tends towards.
[19:40:01] <spruit11> twitter is somewhat useful for having other people filter out the more interesting content.  but you probably miss out on all the important stuff,  which tends to be boring
[19:40:12] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)

[19:43:42] <audrey> IDK, maybe?
[19:43:42] <audrey> I read it because they have actually serious takes on hot button issues
[19:43:42] <audrey> which is rare for Anglophone media these days
[19:43:45] <audrey> I stay away from the «culture wars» most of the time
[19:43:58] <audrey> seems like a real discursive dead end
[19:44:01] <spruit11> isn't that the right wing thingy? I never end up there
[19:44:36] <brigand> what hot button issues if not culture wars?
[19:44:55] <spruit11> right,  we cultural marxists should win this
[19:45:39] <audrey> I don´t consider Quillette particularly right wing.
[19:46:16] <audrey> At least, not in the traditional sense. I guess the political polarities are shifting lately.
[19:49:44] <brigand> i seldomly read astralcodexten
[19:50:11] <spruit11> heh,  'the realities of human genetics'
[19:51:08] <audrey> Right-wing in my mind is something like National Review
[19:51:23] <spruit11> see if they have a podcast
[19:51:37] <audrey> which is kind of predictable/dull, like most openly partisan news sources
[19:53:58] <audrey> (Plot twist: News sources are becoming more openly partisan.)

[20:32:28] <audrey> I mean, Australia has gone the full-authoritarianism route
[20:32:50] <audrey> That was rather sudden from a nation recently heralded as an example of 21st century liberal democracy.
[20:34:31] <audrey> If I had to make a projection, in the next few decades I reckon we will see a continued trend toward more overt forms of statism, and a distancing from old, classical liberal values such as «civil rights» or «civil liberties».

[23:18:37] <ro-bot-o> [url] Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19 | www.cdc.gov
[23:19:10] <causative> this is the chart that cannot be explained away - it tracks *all* deaths in the US from any cause, and you can see the curve of the covid deaths very clearly among them
[23:19:42] <softpaw> whats ur basic conclusion with the data causative
[23:20:31] <bougyman> 100% unconcerned with excess deaths.
[23:20:57] <bougyman> As pandemics go, this one is weak AF.
[23:21:52] <causative> it's up to 650 thousand deaths, officially - actually the excess deaths are more than that
[23:23:54] <brigand> people also forget that this is *with* measurements (masks, distancing etc.)
[23:24:21] <causative> http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths
[23:24:21] <ro-bot-o> [url] Estimation of excess mortality due to COVID-19 | Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation | www.healthdata.org
[23:24:45] <causative> this article estimated 912k excess covid deaths for USA, at a time when 578k were reported
[23:25:03] <causative> that would put it around a million excess deaths now
[23:27:22] <softpaw> wow no way!
[23:29:55] <spruit11> reasonable.  the IFR I kind-of assumed was 1% but of course could be way lower.  but as IFRs go,  we will never find out and it'll be hotly debated for decades
