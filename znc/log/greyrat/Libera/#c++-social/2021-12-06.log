[18:45:40] <ERROH> and then the ruling are playing around it
[19:04:41] <hinst> we gathered the leaves into a bucket and attempted to brew coffee from them; however it proved futile
[19:05:14] <hinst> Ok for some reason HexChat decided to re-send my previous message instead of the message I actually typed

[19:36:09] <ERROH> is it years
[19:36:55] <Juliu> Freenode/Libera is one of the most fascist networks on IRC that I know
[19:37:18] <Juliu> Most people seem to be completely socially retarded nerd that do not care for their own fate
[19:38:36] <ERROH> you will stop with name calling young man
[19:39:14] <Juliu> It's just the truth. Grow up and face it
[19:39:54] <ERROH> how come you're not banned here, are you new
[19:40:23] <Juliu> ERROH, why would I care if fascists banned me or not?
[19:40:29] <Juliu> That's what fascists do
[19:40:47] <Juliu> If you obey them, they will still not change. So there is zero reason to obey
[19:41:11] <ERROH> i see zero reason you'd like to be here if you find fascism so offensive
[19:41:45] <ERROH> !rq juliu
[19:41:45] <nolyc> ERROH: <rpav> .NET? .NOT!
[19:41:50] <Juliu> ERROH, where else should I be? The whole world is currently turning into a fascist hellhole
[19:42:14] <Juliu> And fascists are constantly supporting this even further
[19:42:26] <Juliu> Like most ops on Libera
[19:49:49] <raj> is there any FOSS tool to recover deleted data from usb?
[19:50:36] <T`aZ> there is the ext2,3,4 undelete thingy, maybe something for fat or ntfs also
[19:52:32] <Juliu> raj, good luck. I know how frustrating deleted data can be
