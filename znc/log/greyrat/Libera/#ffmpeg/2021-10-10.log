[14:43:56] <JEEB> tomb^: I think timecodes are usually attached to some other track that they reference if they're supported
[14:45:13] <JEEB> or ok no, just checked and tmcd is its own track as well since it probably requires more effort to hide it
[14:52:12] <tomb^> JEEB, thanks for the reply, I'm not sure I understand.. I tried with other software (am I allowed to mention the competitors?) and it sees the tracks
[14:53:04] <tomb^> is it an argument I need to add in ffprobe or that wouldn't work too?
[14:53:57] <JEEB> what I just meant is that you don't need a separate timecode track; after all the timecode usually refers to another track. but looking at the tmcd box handling in MOV, which is the only thing to which I have access to, it does indeed read a new track (most likely since skipping that is too much effort)
[14:54:25] <JEEB> so if you cannot see a timecode in a video track/container with `ffprobe -v verbose -i INPUT.mxf` then it's just not yet implemented
[14:54:44] *** Quits: durandal_1707 (~computer@212.15.178.109) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:54:46] <JEEB> although do make sure you're poking at current master, like Btbn's automated builds on github
[14:55:24] <JEEB> also quickly looking at the mxf reader there is a UUID implemented for time codes
[14:55:54] <JEEB> `0x06,0x0e,0x2b,0x34,0x02,0x53,0x01,0x01,0x0d,0x01,0x01,0x01,0x01,0x01,0x14,0x00` is implemented
[14:56:03] <tomb^> ffprobe -v -verbose shows just 1 video track and the 8 audio mono tracks, nothing regarding smpte tc
[14:57:17] <JEEB> seems like support for this UUID and tags 0x150(1|2|3) was added in 2012
[14:59:04] <JEEB> there's various code around it, but what I see is that it gets added as stream metadata, which makes more sense than exposing it as a completely separate track. also it might be skipped if it's just zero or so, not 100% sure what that logic does :P

[23:35:14] <Arifd> i just need crop rotate scale and blend algorithms, so i thought i would code it in Rust for speed and have android/java request a frame from the webcam and pass it to my Rust lib for processing
[23:35:58] <BtbN> last time someone decided to do media stuff in rust for the speed, it was a magnitude or two slower than ffmpegs C implementation
[23:37:04] <Arifd> Rust's Image library doesn't handle yuv formats, and I have been able to copy code from the web to produce yuv to rgb conversion in Rust, but it's very expensive (could be parallelized i suppose) but then i have no idea how that will interoperate with android
[23:37:29] <BtbN> there's like 20 different ways to convert between RGB and YUV
[23:37:38] <BtbN> which one is correct depends on colorspace and primaries
[23:38:16] <Arifd> also it's ycbcr_to_rgb and back, which is actually 3 components, so i don't think helps me anyway tbh

[23:39:50] <Arifd> Rust by default is not always fast, correct, but you just have to know rust well and be prepared to use unsafe {} to do the clever stuff that will let you get every bit as fast as C
[23:40:11] <BtbN> At which point you might as well just write C

[23:41:40] <Arifd> well, you can, if you know very well what you're doing. I don't so I like that the compiler guides me and warns me away from stupid mistakes
[23:41:58] <BtbN> you just said you turn all that off lol
[23:42:15] <BtbN> because, big surprise, all the sanity chacking is quite slow
[23:42:19] <Arifd> for me, as an iterative process as i learn where all the dangers are and how to overcome them
[23:42:35] <Arifd> which is why i said, by default rust isn't always fast
[23:42:44] <Arifd> you then have to do the sanity checking, as you say

[23:43:39] <Arifd> but it's certainly faster than doing it in Java which is the alternative, if i'm going to port this to android, no?
[23:44:00] <BtbN> Rust is not a language I'd at all think of for android
[23:44:04] <BtbN> at least not any more than C

[23:45:14] <Arifd> right, but the bar was set at "not any more than C"
[23:45:32] <BtbN> I don't follow what you're trying to say.
[23:45:33] <Arifd> doing your computationally heavy work in C, seems like a good idea on android
[23:45:42] <BtbN> For android, you're kinda forced to use JVM based stuff
