[01:43:31] <kline> manicennui, yes, but rust is bad and non-standard
[01:43:54] <manicennui> bsandro: I don't know the answer, but both MS and Apple seem to have realized that there should be a standard.
[01:44:05] <manicennui> Whether their particular standard is good is another geek debate.
[01:44:11] <bsandro> manicennui: yeah there are standards that barely anyone cares about just like with linux
[01:44:28] <manicennui> Barely anyone?
[01:44:32] <kline> manicennui, cargo for example using .cargo is particularly egregious because it mixes bin, config, and cache in a single directory
[01:44:36] <bsandro> windows utils got their configs in registry, ini, xml, yaml, toml at any random place you can imagine
[01:44:50] <kline> which makes it easy to nuke your entire environment in 1 command, i guess, which is nice

[06:44:58] <technomancy> I guess most of the discussion I saw was "why the hell would you use this"
[06:45:44] <manicennui> I still see a lot of people who seem to really want it for things that should be trivial to write by anyone semi-proficient.
[06:46:16] <manicennui> And a lot of ML apologists claiming that it will help with the things that people look up on SO frequently.
[06:46:25] <technomancy> it's really unendingly amusing to me that the solution is to make things more complex instead of making things simpler
[06:47:52] <technomancy> maybe copilot will reduce the evolutionary pressure preventing languages and ecosystems from getting too complex for the human brain to handle; eventually all languages will just be more and more shit piled on top of each other and no one will care because it's not your job to remember things or understand things any more
[06:48:01] <technomancy> I mean, that's kinda what happened with Eclipse

[06:52:00] <manicennui> The problems I see people praising copilot for solving are more along the lines of people not learning the basics of the language they use, and people not remembering the arguments to library methods.
[06:52:12] <manicennui> The second is mostly solved with tooling.
[06:52:31] <manicennui> I'm also not someone who uses autocomplete, so what do I know.
[06:52:43] <gwozniak> I saw someone I respect praising copilot with what I found to be trivial nonsense today
[06:53:19] <gwozniak> I barely use completion, aside from Emacs' dabbrev, which is basically a dumb completion
[06:53:56] <gwozniak> "It prevented me from typing some symbols" is damning with faint praise, imo

[06:55:44] <manicennui> The entire article rings very true for me in the Ruby world for what it's worth.
[06:56:41] <manicennui> I've had more than one person tell me that they ask candidates to write a basic class in Ruby to weed out Rails developers who don't actually understand what they are doing.

[07:01:57] <manicennui> But there is a real problem with perpetual beginners IMHO.

[07:36:29] <gwozniak> It's like a macro that writes out all the macro for you, but you just see it spit out all the inards and you have no idea what the genesis of the macro is, so _maybe_ it's a reasonable choice
[07:38:37] <gwozniak> I imagine writing a for loop in C and having it immediately replaced with the assembly. This seems like a poor idea.

[17:59:17] <iDrougge> Is this because everything is mutable by default in Go?
[17:59:23] <bsandro> like, in js everything is passed by reference (except primitive types), that might create quite nasty crutches
[18:01:13] <iDrougge> And in Go everything is passed by value?
[18:01:43] <bsandro> in Go you have to decide yourself since pointers are in play
[18:02:10] <iDrougge> Pointers are in play?
[18:02:43] <mTvare[m]> When thinking of "const pointer", does it make more sense to be a variable which points to one address and can't change the address and can change value stored in the address or one which points to address and can't change the address and can't change value of whats stored there 🤔
[18:02:51] <mTvare[m]> bsandro: isn't it same in java
[18:03:16] <iDrougge> Java is pass-by-reference if the type is spelt with a capital letter.
[18:03:33] <iDrougge> Bar some hidden boxing rules.
[18:04:02] <mTvare[m]> What if someone names a class with small lettors
[18:04:04] <mTvare[m]> s/lettors/letters/
[18:04:21] <iDrougge> Then it's pass by value, just as it is private in Go.

[18:05:55] <epilys> rust has GC, it's just static (checked on compile time)
[18:06:38] <epilys> of course one can argue that's not a GC, I guess that's mostly semantics and how you define it
[18:07:02] <mTvare[m]> Yeah, GC is usually when its done at runtime
