[01:15:32] <manicennui> Helm is "The package manager for Kubernetes"
[01:15:50] <manicennui> How many layers of package managers can we include to deploy one piece of software?

[01:20:16] <dimadima> manicennui: helm is absurd for the use-case
[01:20:19] <dimadima> for tahat*
[01:20:22] <dimadima> for that*
[01:20:38] <dimadima> BUT it's awesome otherwise
[01:23:22] <dimadima> i use it principally for (i) its variable substitution functionality (ii) its cleanup/rollback functionality which imo should be built into k8s but hey
[01:26:07] <dimadima> it's weird they call it a package manager

[05:25:41] <manicennui> I saw that but didn't watch it.
[05:29:14] <manicennui> Holy shit. California is considering a Harrison Bergeron situation with mathematics.
[05:29:29] <manicennui> Limiting courses available in middle and high school to make things more "equal".
[05:29:32] <manicennui> What the fucking fuck.
[05:30:19] <companion_cube> dimadima: there's a k8s IDE, too, did you know?
[05:31:52] * manicennui wonders whether companion_cube has a French accent.
[05:32:10] <companion_cube> I do indeed
[05:32:17] <companion_cube> apparently it's quite thick
[05:32:31] <manicennui> I assume you know how to properly pronounce my nick.
[05:32:31] <companion_cube> (but my english is leagues better than the average french person's :))
[05:32:50] <manicennui> I use the same name in games, and it's amusing when people try to figure it out.
[05:32:58] <companion_cube> ah, not sure. Guessing how new words are pronounced is basically impossible
[05:33:06] <manicennui> manic ennui
[05:33:12] <companion_cube> :D
[05:33:26] <companion_cube> I thought the "c" would be "ssss"
[05:33:53] <manicennui> I think I've had maybe 4 people in the entire time I've played Overwatch know the word ennui.
[05:34:04] <manicennui> Maybe I should throw an underscore in there.
[05:34:12] <companion_cube> what cracks me up is how y'all pronounce "genre"
[05:34:14] <companion_cube> yeah maybe
[05:34:23] <companion_cube> I didn't tokenize your nick properly
[05:34:57] <manicennui> That's interesting to me, and makes me think I should not expect people who aren't French to get it.
[05:35:23] <manicennui> I stole the term from David Foster Wallace.
[05:35:42] <companion_cube> "ce" binds quite tightly in my head
[05:36:53] <manicennui> "The problem is that, however misprised it’s been, what’s been passed down from the postmodern heyday is sarcasm, cynicism, a manic ennui, suspicion of all authority, suspicion of all constraints on conduct, and a terrible penchant for ironic diagnosis of unpleasantness instead of an ambition not just to diagnose and ridicule but to redeem."
[05:37:26] <companion_cube> are we talking about 4chan? :)
[05:37:39] <manicennui> I kind of doubt that DFW read 4chan.
[05:38:08] <manicennui> I've had a crazy idea.
[05:38:14] <manicennui> I don't know whether I want to do it.
[05:38:15] <companion_cube> well it fits pretty well
[05:38:30] <manicennui> But what if we had a video chat sometime with the longtime regulars here?
[05:39:58] <companion_cube> why not, that sounds fun
[05:40:06] <companion_cube> biggest challenge is probably to find a date
[05:56:39] <manicennui> Reading about this California math framework issue, it seems like every problem in America.
[05:57:38] <manicennui> The problem lies with just about every aspect of American society, but those problems are impossible to solve because of Republicans, so let's change the thing in a way that, while possibly well meaning, will be bad for many people and won't solve the actual problem.

[06:19:50] <dimadima> companion_cube: did not know that but i can't even tell if you're trolling me
[06:20:02] <dimadima> i installed a k8s plugin for vscode and it annoyed me so i disabled it
[06:20:14] <dimadima> it had some special yaml features
[06:20:23] <dimadima> but i have no qualms with yaml
[06:20:38] <manicennui> Didn't know that he was French?
[06:20:49] <dimadima> i knew companion_cube was french
[06:21:03] <dimadima> are you saying the french troll?
[06:21:13] <dimadima> i can't get my french stereotypes straight tbh
[06:21:50] <companion_cube> you didn't know what?
[06:22:06] <dimadima> that there was a k8s ide, apparently?
[06:22:22] <dimadima> certainly thats... a joke?

[06:34:59] <companion_cube> ah!
[06:35:04] <companion_cube> not a joke
[06:35:10] <companion_cube> I saw it on github recommendations 😂
[06:36:20] <manicennui> I'm waiting for the next stage of all this nonsense when everything is simplified, hopefully.
[06:43:21] <companion_cube> like, people abandoning the cloud? :)
[06:43:30] <dimadima> manicennui: harrison bergeron hadn't heard of that! i've never read vonnegut actually
[06:43:40] <companion_cube> I could see things getting simpler by getting more proprietary
[06:43:45] <dimadima> companion_cube: ah far out
[06:43:47] <companion_cube> all is now JS running on lambda or whatever
[06:43:53] <manicennui> dimadima: It's a story that seems absurd, but now CA seems determined to do it.
[06:44:09] <dimadima> manicennui: the same thing is happening in new york city as well
[06:44:38] <dimadima> from a user standpoint k8s is really quite simple
[06:44:48] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'm hoping that containers become more integrated with the OS actually.
[06:44:50] <dimadima> i wouldn't want to operate it, i think, at least not for no reason
[06:45:04] <manicennui> companion_cube: At a level that matches the options for running processes today.
[06:45:04] <companion_cube> manicennui: doesn't seem to solve the distributed/redundant part
[06:45:12] <dimadima> but as a user, k8s is butter
[06:45:12] <companion_cube> if anything that'd just kill docker
[06:45:15] <companion_cube> (praise jeebus)
[06:45:24] <manicennui> companion_cube: Hoping that part becomes more integrated as well.
[06:45:28] <dimadima> i think close OS integration is happening/here
[06:45:35] <dimadima> isn't that basically systemd
[06:45:39] <dimadima> to some extent
[06:45:44] <companion_cube> yeah kind of
[06:45:44] <manicennui> Maybe that is what is missing: OSes acknowledging the distributed nature of many applications.
[06:45:50] <companion_cube> systemd + cgroups is already kind of nice
[06:46:53] <manicennui> Definitely don't want to rely on commercial services to make kubernetes tolerable.
[06:47:14] <manicennui> Although it is probably the best option currently.
[06:47:32] <companion_cube> if he read you, ddevault would jump in here and present plan9 as the solution
[06:49:34] <manicennui> It's definitely sad that we seem stuck with the original UNIX concepts, even when they are less than ideal.
[06:51:59] <companion_cube> in any case, why do you think linux will learn how to run in a distributed fashion? :)
[06:53:07] <dimadima> i dont meant to interrupt but i want to share this
[06:54:10] <dimadima> i live in a suburb of baltimore that's heavily jewish, large religious community. there are many jewish publications around including some which are just mostly advertisements, including one called "The Advertiser" which in its October 21, 2021 edition had this ad f
[06:54:22] <dimadima> https://i.imgur.com/c5rJXA2.jpg
[06:54:47] <dimadima> Pariser's has been advertising in The Advertiser for years and has never had an ad like this
[06:55:17] <companion_cube> they even have a cake for lung cancer, damn
[06:55:36] <dimadima> lol
[06:55:52] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't know whether it will.
[06:56:31] <manicennui> Yeah, wtf is with the cigarettes?
[06:58:14] <dimadima> speculating over here it's sabotage?
[06:58:30] <dimadima> even if they made that cake for somebody, why on earth would they put it in their ad
[06:58:46] <dimadima> "congratulations you have lung cancer" is a solid take
[06:59:53] <companion_cube> that's the kind of cake your order anonymously for your loathed colleague
[06:59:57] <companion_cube> (who just got lung cancer)
[07:00:18] <companion_cube> not that I'd do that, obviously, ordering that kind of cake probably requires to talk to someone on the phone.
[07:01:11] <manicennui> Someone on HN had the same idea: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29619538
[07:01:12] <buttsbot> That's right! Letting gifted kids pursue their interests has essentially no cost... | Hacker News
[07:01:49] <manicennui> companion_cube: I recently watched an episode of a show where Paul Hollywood traveled to Paris. I was very impressed by the bakery culture presented.
[07:02:03] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't know how one could go from that to the US.
[07:02:11] <companion_cube> ah well, probably hard
[07:02:16] <companion_cube> for a start we have regulations on the price of bread :D
[07:02:29] <companion_cube> you can find good bakeries in many, many cities
[07:02:39] <manicennui> He visited a bakery that produces what some consider to be the best baguette, and the baker said that many people come twice per day for baguette.
[07:02:53] <manicennui> He works 16 hours per day.
[07:03:47] <manicennui> One of my favorite moments was when he was in a pastry shop that is considered one of the best in the world, and he said, "They look incredible." The employee responded, "They look French."
[07:03:48] <companion_cube> yeah they wake up so fucking early.
[07:03:53] <companion_cube> it's a special lifestyle.
[07:04:07] <manicennui> I love how arrogant the French can be.
[07:04:10] <companion_cube> last summer I went to a bakery which won "paris' best croissant" a few years ago
[07:04:16] <companion_cube> and, well, the croissants were indeed fucking good
[07:04:24] <dimadima> heh awesome
[07:04:34] <companion_cube> (I don't even like croissants that much, I prefer "pains au chocolat", the chocolate variant)
[07:04:38] <manicennui> I love that sense of pride they have.
[07:04:54] <companion_cube> pride is found everywhere :)
[07:04:57] <manicennui> I think that is missing from a lot of what we do in the US.
[07:05:04] <companion_cube> :D you kidding
[07:05:05] <manicennui> Or it is misplaced.
[07:05:11] <companion_cube> americans are so proud of the US
[07:05:24] <manicennui> Sure, but they don't back it up with actions that justify the pride.
[07:05:25] <dimadima> companion_cube: these days?
[07:05:31] <dimadima> no one under 25 would possibly admit that
[07:05:36] <dimadima> in many parts of the country
[07:05:45] <companion_cube> ah
[07:05:52] <manicennui> It think a lot of Americans are prideful about things that are bad.
[07:05:53] <companion_cube> french bakers (and wine producers) may be very proud
[07:06:03] <companion_cube> but generally speaking, france bashing is popular in France
[07:06:20] <dimadima> i'm not saying it's wrong or right, just that when i was a kid people were way more unequivocally USA USA!
[07:06:30] <dimadima> really?
[07:06:35] <dimadima> for what?
[07:06:41] <dimadima> algeria?
[07:07:28] <manicennui> I don't know whether French wine and bread are always amazing, but they seem to have reason to be much more prideful than Americans, on average.
[07:07:37] <manicennui> We make some really shit products, and spread them to the rest of the world.
[07:07:41] <companion_cube> for not being as great as it used to be I guess? or just general pessimism
[07:07:59] <companion_cube> algeria is still too sore to talk about, I think. for the most part.
[07:08:07] <companion_cube> and now I'm thinking of zemmour
[07:08:09] <companion_cube> fuck.
[07:08:42] * dimadima googles zemmour
[07:08:57] <dimadima> ah up and coming this person?
[07:09:11] <dimadima> going to make france great again?
[07:09:19] * manicennui waits for the French to chop off some more heads.
[07:09:31] <manicennui> Mad respect if you kill some elites.
[07:09:40] <dimadima> are you anti elite
[07:09:47] <manicennui> dimadima: To some extent.
[07:10:06] <dimadima> the élite
[07:10:12] <manicennui> I think we focus on the wrong elites to be made at in the US.
[07:10:23] <dimadima> yeah americans can't get past celebrities
[07:10:36] <manicennui> Like Bezos is problematic, but not in the top 10 people I'd like to murder.
[07:10:46] <manicennui> He is giving us what we want.
[07:10:48] <dimadima> most rich ppl fly by night
[07:11:10] <dimadima> yeah no one is killing bezos or rich ppl in general here
[07:11:11] <manicennui> Musk is a douche, but again, not in the top 10.
[07:11:18] <dimadima> who's in your top 5
[07:11:22] <manicennui> Various politicians though...
[07:11:30] <manicennui> dimadima: I don't want to have a chat with the FBI.
[07:11:31] <dimadima> are politicians even elite
[07:11:42] <dimadima> i see
[07:11:43] <manicennui> dimadima: Many are millionaires with a lot of power.
[07:11:48] <dimadima> who are you least favorite elites manicennui
[07:11:49] <dimadima> lol
[07:12:02] <manicennui> A handful are clearly a roadblock to making any real progress.
[07:12:05] <dimadima> why would millionares have power
[07:12:12] <dimadima> when they don't even have that much money
[07:12:14] <manicennui> Because democracy is for sale.
[07:12:18] <dimadima> ;)
[07:12:53] <dimadima> can't have democracy w/o an educated well-read electorate
[07:13:13] <manicennui> Even Bill Gates has done some pretty horrendous things politically.
[07:13:15] <dimadima> money is largely secondary to that
[07:13:36] <manicennui> But people give him a pass because they don't know much about his foundation.
[07:17:39] <dimadima> i got down on BG when i found out he was a creep
[07:17:54] <dimadima> nerd creepin billionare thing is unsavory
[07:19:43] <manicennui> Nerds gonna creep
[07:21:39] <dimadima> i guess
[07:21:44] <dimadima> i liked to think of him as not a creep
[07:21:58] <dimadima> i never liked MS but i always like gates for some reason
[07:22:05] <dimadima> smart motherfucker
[07:22:55] <dimadima> wrote FAT on an airplane allegedy
[07:26:03] <companion_cube> dimadima: yeah he's the new french trump
[07:26:14] <companion_cube> except skinny and bilious instead of fat and boisterous
[07:26:36] <companion_cube> a sickly piece of shit
[07:26:44] <manicennui> dimadima: You just liked his chair jumping skills
[07:26:58] <bontaq> dimadima: I think you can have a fine democracy with a semi-illiterate un-educated electorate
[07:29:27] <dimadima> if your electorate is semi-illiterate and uneducated they just get trumped every 2 seconds
[07:29:51] <manicennui> Do you believe any other situation is achievable?
[07:29:52] <bontaq> eh or FDR
[07:30:07] <manicennui> I think the ideal is pure fantasy.
[07:30:26] <bontaq> something like selfishness I think is way more harmful to democracy / a functioning government over lack of education
[07:30:33] <manicennui> It's a least bad situation.
[07:31:56] <dimadima> check out the first few page of "Typographic America" from "Amusing Ourselves to Death"
[07:32:01] <dimadima> chapter 3
[07:32:23] <manicennui> Oh, Neal Postman
[07:32:27] <manicennui> Love him.
[07:33:10] <manicennui> I've never managed to read his books, but I've read and watched a lot of interviews with him.
[07:33:58] <manicennui> And of course I've seen the popular comic about Orwell versus Aldous Huxley.
[07:34:32] <dimadima> i can send you the PDF of the first few pages of that chapter
[07:34:36] <dimadima> i blieve that should be fair use
[07:34:46] <dimadima> i'd liek to know if you think that's fantasy
[07:35:07] <manicennui> I own the book.
[07:35:11] <manicennui> Just haven't read it.
[07:35:12] <dimadima> oh nice
[07:35:16] <dimadima> well check out chapter 3 and 4
[07:35:26] <dimadima> i wonder myself
[07:35:39] <dimadima> it's about this exact topic bontaq brought up
[07:38:55] <bontaq> cool I'll have to check it out -- I'm just saying with a widely less-educated population we got FDR and associations between "read a book", "education" and "the electorate makes good choices" fall kind of flat for me
[07:39:47] <dimadima> what does FDR represent
[07:39:58] <dimadima> he means different things to different people
[07:41:25] <bontaq> I'd say the last good shot we had at european style socialism, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights would be quite mind blowing even today if the president said it
[07:41:25] <buttsbot> Second Bill of Rights - Wikipedia
[07:42:20] <manicennui> Even Republicans are afraid to mess with FDR's popular programs today.
[07:42:29] <manicennui> Although they talk about it from time to time.
[07:42:37] <manicennui> They know they will lose elderly voters.
[07:43:40] <bontaq> Actually I guess even better than european style socialism, we would've leap frogged into the future if those were seriously taken rights
[07:44:52] <manicennui> We value the freedom to die for the wealth of others.
[07:47:00] <bontaq> Which is weird since it's an imaginary line.  You can gaurantee housing for people but they can still die for their chosen million/billionaire if they like
[07:47:59] <bontaq> Obviously I as a citizen would be much _more_ free if I didn't have to worry about housing, medical care, or retirement
[07:50:42] <companion_cube> except for the right to have a tiny tiny shot at becoming a billionaire
[07:50:47] <companion_cube> that trumps everything else
[07:50:48] <buttsbot> 🍊🤵👎
[07:52:17] <manicennui> I think the housing problem has a simple solution that everyone would hate for decades.
[07:52:30] <companion_cube> forbid it being an investment vehicle?
[07:52:32] <bontaq> oh?
[07:52:37] <manicennui> companion_cube: Basically.
[07:52:43] <companion_cube> house price rises are so depressing
[07:52:47] <manicennui> Tax the fuck out of all property that isn't a primary residence.
[07:52:51] <manicennui> Including rental properties.
[07:52:55] <companion_cube> it's like a timer that says "you want to buy in a few years? ahah lol"
[07:52:59] <manicennui> The transition would be hard.
[07:53:09] <companion_cube> but what would we do with all that tax money?!
[07:53:46] <manicennui> Canada is considering a temporary ban on foreign investors purchasing real estate.
[07:53:47] <bontaq> yeah I've mostly given up on owning a house, even though I'm incredibly lucky and make that good programmer money.  Shit can't compete with NYC prices
[07:54:09] <manicennui> bontaq: Never plan to move?
[07:54:14] <manicennui> I "own" my condo in Chicago.
[07:54:21] <manicennui> The situation here is far better.
[07:54:40] <manicennui> But I want some land and plan to move.
[07:54:51] <manicennui> Still completely feasible for me to own something.
[07:54:57] <bontaq> ehh I consider it, and was even looking at chicago :P  I do actually like NYC though so it sucks
[07:55:21] <manicennui> bontaq: Pittsburgh looks super affordable and has a lot of the things I like about urban living.
[07:56:04] <bontaq> shh don't talk up pittsburgh, it's where I'm from and somehow prices are still sort of reasonable
[07:56:19] <manicennui> Yeah, I'm still wondering what the downside is.
[07:56:37] <manicennui> Other than fewer jobs than the really big cities.
[07:56:46] <bontaq> if The Company allows permanent remote I might just head back there
[07:57:10] <manicennui> My employer is allowing permanent remote, but we need additional permission to move to another state.
[07:57:25] <manicennui> I have a bit of pull though, so they would probably do more to allow me to move where I want.
[08:00:21] <bontaq> we have to do some sort of justification for remote, I have to figure out something better than the office blows and it's not worth eight hours of my life every week commuting
[08:01:43] <companion_cube> I'm sure your local starbuck's blow is better than the office blow
[08:01:48] <companion_cube> that's a good excuse right?
[08:02:08] <manicennui> bontaq: Can you not tell them, "I'll find a new job otherwise."
[08:03:09] <bontaq> ah yeah but I'd rather not go so radical unless required.  it is a nice job
[08:03:23] <manicennui> My employer was still making bullshit excuses about, "We work better together!" until several people found other jobs.
[08:04:13] <manicennui> Now half the company wants to be remote permanently and they are converting our crappy team rooms into more conference rooms.
[08:04:16] <bontaq> to me joking about having to find a new job my grandboss clarified it's very much up to manager discretion which is to say I'm probably fine doing remote
[08:05:22] <bontaq> lool they've been doing similar cajoling here talking up how sweet the office is and those ever blessed water cooler conversations
[08:05:30] <manicennui> I don't joke. I have enough security that I can just tell them straight up that I'll find another job, and they are worried about losing me.
[08:05:53] <manicennui> In the last couple of years I truly stopped giving a shit.
[08:05:58] <manicennui> It is has been so freeing.
[08:06:21] <manicennui> But they have responded by treating me even better, promoting me, etc.
[08:07:15] <bontaq> yeah one coworkers technique of already having an offer from another company has definitely worked out for them during raise / salary / anything negotiation XD
[08:07:48] <manicennui> I'm just old, I have enough money putting away, and I don't fake anything anymore.
[08:07:58] <manicennui> If they fire me, I'll be fine.
[08:09:02] <manicennui> But I also basically run my team for my manager, and the larger team relies on me quite a bit.
[08:11:35] <bontaq> that's a good place to be, I'm not quite as secure but once I have some sort of house (probably in pittsburgh) I really doubt I'll care anymore
[08:12:06] <manicennui> s/putting/put/
[08:12:27] <manicennui> I was pretty bad with my money in my 20s and halfway through my 30s.
[08:12:48] <manicennui> Then I started saving, bought a condo. and now I have enough put away to last several years if I had to.
[08:13:15] <manicennui> But while Chicago is far more affordable than NYC, I still don't get much for my money.
[08:14:42] <manicennui> I paid (mortgaged) a 2 bed, 2 bath condo that is just under 1k square feet for just under $300k.
[08:14:48] <manicennui> Which would be a steal in NYC.
[08:15:04] <manicennui> About 35-40 minutes from downtown by train.
[08:20:13] <bontaq> yeah if I could find a joint like that here I'd get it in a second
[08:21:07] <manicennui> I assume NYC has a lot of the same problems as Chicago, possibly to a greater extent.
[08:21:23] <manicennui> My building is 100 years old, and the gut rehab was not great.
[08:21:36] <manicennui> And I have a third-floor walk up.
[08:21:41] <manicennui> Which gets old.
[08:22:38] <bontaq> it's good exercise :P
[08:23:00] <manicennui> And parking is a joke, so I don't own a car.
[08:23:21] <bontaq> gut rehabs here are just a problem because they take incredibly beautiful brownstones and destroy everything inside to make it look like shit
[08:23:53] <manicennui> Gut rehabs look good here, but they tend not to fix any actual structural problems. I can hear everything that goes on in the condo above me.
[08:24:24] <manicennui> And they installed the roof membrane incorrectly, which trapped moisture in the brick, and the owners had to fix it a few years before I bought.
[08:24:31] <manicennui> It still causes problems today.

[08:27:09] <manicennui> The woodwork, doors, kitchen, and bathrooms are pretty decent.
[08:27:20] <manicennui> And the floors are pretty beautiful.
[08:28:09] <manicennui> But the brickwork is super dusty and pieces fall off from time to time, the entire south wall is cold as fuck during the winter, and there is no noise isolation.
[08:30:05] <bontaq> oh like brick dust inside?  anywhere I've been with exposed brick always has some kinda dust
[08:30:34] <manicennui> Yeah, but it's more like small pieces of the brick crumbling.
[08:30:49] <manicennui> It looks great though!
[08:31:16] <bontaq> yeah those're some dank floors
[08:31:51] <bontaq> here a lot of the brownstones had really incredible wood work, but they always just delete it during renovations
[08:33:28] <manicennui> I'm just over city living.
[08:33:41] <manicennui> Although I'm still considering some place like Pittsburgh.
[08:34:18] <manicennui> I really want a garden and maybe some waterfowl.
[08:34:27] <manicennui> And to be able to crank my music.
[08:34:32] <bontaq> https://imgur.com/a/fC6Y2TQ in my current place, they renovated it right and actually left the original wood work

[20:27:06] <indigo> Sometimes
[20:27:21] <dimadima> what kind of desktops they got over there?
[20:27:23] <indigo> There's a very smart way to ensure these kinds of things don't happen in the first place, which is to take the broken thing when you replace it with the new thing
[20:27:32] <dimadima> heh
[20:28:01] <dimadima> do you at least have a window with LEDs and stuff?
[20:28:06] <indigo> Hahah no
[20:28:15] <indigo> I mean at home I do
[20:28:15] <dimadima> booooring
[20:28:21] <manicennui> I have no idea how my employer keeps track of hardware. It gets moved around between people a lot, and now a bunch of it has been taken to people's homes.
[20:29:08] <indigo> I think they probably have a database somewhere with asset tag -> person
[20:29:21] <companion_cube> you misspelled "spreadsheet"
[20:29:44] <manicennui> indigo: Sure, but when monitors and such get moved between people, they don't always get told.
[20:29:54] <manicennui> Quite often when someone leaves, their stuff is just free game.
[20:30:12] <manicennui> Sometimes it sits there for months and then someone grabs some of it.
[20:30:25] <dimadima> if i was a capitalilzed employer i'm not sure i'd track computers too closely
[20:30:41] <dimadima> it seems better to give employees new stuff and let them keep it
[20:30:48] <manicennui> I think they have some idea about laptops.
[20:31:01] <manicennui> dimadima: Only if the employee lasts 3 years.
[20:31:03] <dimadima> unless you give them a brand new M1 and they quit in like 3 months orsomething

[20:31:54] <buttsbot> Is this a write off? Scene from Schitt's Creek - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCP27_vquxQ
[20:34:24] <manicennui> I wonder how many people don't understand tax write offs.
[20:34:34] <manicennui> Probably a lot.
[20:35:11] <manicennui> A lot of people are still confused about tax brackets and think that making more money puts them at risk of having less take home.
[20:36:19] <manicennui> Many people think we should teach things like taxes in school, but I'm not convinced that most people would get it any more than they understand the things that are already taught.
[20:36:32] <companion_cube> it's ok, just click the button in turbotax anyway
[20:36:38] <companion_cube> (ugh)
[20:36:51] <manicennui> Even better, you can now pay someone else to do your taxes in TurboTax.
[20:37:44] <manicennui> You just upload all of your documents and answer maybe a dozen questions.
[20:38:47] <manicennui> Pretty similar to going to H&R Block or whatever.
[20:45:16] <dimadima> shittiest thing about JS runtimes is that rethrowing an error doesn't preserve the stack
[20:45:36] <dimadima> so if you don't handle that carefully/correctly, our stack can have a bunch of async stuff and not include any of your code
[20:45:42] <dimadima> your*
[20:46:57] <dimadima> it sucks
[20:47:02] <dimadima> i am experiencing this right now
[20:47:43] <manicennui> You deserve the pain for using JS.
[20:48:17] <dimadima> lol was waiting for that
[20:48:35] <dimadima> fair enough
[20:48:44] <manicennui> =P
[20:53:17] <indigo> Exceptions are just evil
[20:53:38] <indigo> It's not only JS that loses the stack when you rethrow an exception; I think PHP does it as well
[20:54:51] <dimadima> the best way to handle this is to write code w/o mistakes
[20:55:22] <indigo> - Jonathan Blow
[20:55:49] <riv> are exceptions really bad? what approach do you prefer?
[20:56:03] <manicennui> panics
[20:56:09] <dimadima> lol
[20:56:14] <dimadima> old school
[20:56:28] <dimadima> riv: maybe returning an error?
[20:56:29] <manicennui> The correct answer is something like Rust's Result type.
[20:56:40] <dimadima> i would prefer something lik ethat
[20:56:41] <indigo> I'm sure that with anything, there is a time and a place. I prefer StatusOrs or Result<T, E>
[20:56:44] <dimadima> Go has something like that, too
[20:57:08] <manicennui> Go just has multiple return values.
[20:57:25] <dimadima> it doesn't have a special facility for returning errors?
[20:58:04] <indigo> Generally things return (result, error)
[20:58:16] <indigo> But it doesn't enforce that you check for the error when taking the result
[20:58:17] <riv> yeah the result, error thing kinda sucks
[20:58:34] <dimadima> still better than throwing, imo
[20:58:49] <dimadima> though my opinion is based on nothing because i've never actually used go
[20:58:59] <riv> i always thought throw was good, at least in a statically typed language - maybe im missing some of the negatives?
[20:59:18] <dimadima> riv: what do you think about checked vs unchecked excpetions in java
[20:59:27] <dimadima> if you've spent time in java
[20:59:33] <riv> i don't know the term. aren't all exceptions checked in java?
[20:59:34] <dimadima> and even if you haven't, presuming you know what i'm refering to
[20:59:42] <manicennui> riv: No.
[20:59:52] <manicennui> Checked means the caller must handle them.
[21:00:02] <riv> interesting
[21:00:05] <manicennui> Won't compile otherwise.
[21:00:07] <dimadima> and they are elicitly declared in the function sig
[21:00:07] <riv> learned a new thing
[21:00:16] <riv> I kind of thing all exceptions should be checked?
[21:00:20] <riv> think*
[21:00:25] <dimadima> it's a big debate
[21:00:38] <manicennui> A lot of people seem to hate them, but if you are going to use exceptions, it seems like they should be checked.
[21:00:42] <dimadima> i'm kind of with you, except if you require all exceptions to be checked it gets kind of... crazy imo
[21:00:54] <manicennui> It's pretty common to just have something at the top level that catches everything.
[21:01:13] <dimadima> the big issue w/ java is that it allows for both
[21:01:17] <dimadima> checked/unchecked
[21:01:19] <manicennui> dimadima: It's only crazy because the code for handling them is excessive.
[21:01:24] <dimadima> yeah
[21:01:36] <dimadima> it's weird they made it so you could have both
[21:03:58] <indigo> And then you forget to check for an exception, it gets caught somewhere up the chain, and you spend some time scratching your head while you debug the stacktrace
[21:04:44] <manicennui> Job security baby!
[21:04:50] <indigo> Whereas handling errors with Result<T,E> is way more explicit
[21:05:52] <dimadima> returning errors is so the way to go imo
[21:06:03] <dimadima> don't think that's a radical thing for me to say

[21:24:43] <dimadima> i've lost many hours on typos like this

[21:26:23] <dimadima> wife and i got boosted yesterday. she got pretty messed up overnight
[21:26:35] <dimadima> we went 2x pfizer, and now moderna
[21:28:27] <defect> i went for pfizer for my booster. mostly because i barely had any side effects from the first two
[21:28:31] <defect> what made you switch it up?
[21:29:59] <indigo> I think that's just how she is? Haha
[21:30:10] <indigo> dimadima: Nice! I also did 2x pfizer and moderna for booster
[21:32:15] <dimadima> defect: the hope that variety is good?
[21:32:25] <riv> is moderna ok? I heard it was worse in terms of side effects?

[21:32:56] <epilys> its ok
[21:32:58] <dimadima> i haven't had any sideeffects so far but my wife started running a fever overnight and got the shakes
[21:33:11] <dimadima> went away with some tylenol but she didn't sleep well and  took the day off today
[21:33:29] <dimadima> she's 1/2 my weight and i wonder why they give the same dose to her and me
[21:33:55] <dimadima> experiment vaccine i tell ya
[21:34:11] <dimadima> epilys: what are they dispensing in greece?
[21:35:02] <companion_cube> not a question of weight
[21:35:19] <companion_cube> people just react differently
[21:35:22] <dimadima> companion_cube: i guess cause it's injected locally? but it hits the blood stream pretty fast?
[21:35:52] <companion_cube> the vaccine? sure, but what matters is how your immune system reacts
[21:36:17] <dimadima> why wouldn't the quantity matter, though?
[21:37:30] <companion_cube> idk, it's a pretty small quantity anyway
[21:37:50] <companion_cube> your body is the one manufacturing the protein spikes, afaik
[21:38:00] <companion_cube> it's not like it's a given dose of dead virus
[21:38:02] <indigo> The Moderna booster is a half dose
[22:00:41] <cb> half? https://twitter.com/drewtoothpaste/status/1470123702364913673
[22:00:42] <buttsbot> Twatter - drewtoothpaste - in case you're worried Something Awful users are no longer insane, here's a guy who has gotten over 30 vaccine doses this year https://t.co/B6pLsHk3iM
[22:07:32] <gwozniak> I booked my 3rd dose shortly after the site opened up for it.  I am booked for February.
[22:13:01] * manicennui fights with JIRA to paste some JSON in a comment
[22:13:45] * manicennui gives up
[22:19:35] <manicennui> OMG Libera staff @hereing us.
[22:19:44] <riv> lol
[22:23:25] <indigo> cb: That's great
[22:24:59] <gwozniak> manicennui: in our version of Jira, I pretty much use {noformat} all the time.
[22:27:27] <manicennui> Woah. I did not know that shrek is a yiddish word.
[22:47:56] <manicennui> My upstairs neighbors are the least considerate people imaginable. JFC
[22:49:06] <manicennui> Last night they had a loud conversation in their bedroom (which is right above mine) at 1 AM.
[22:49:13] <manicennui> And they bang shit on the floor all day every day.
[22:50:20] <manicennui> It makes me anxious.

[23:13:30] <riv> that is amazing handwriting
[23:13:33] <dimadima> manicennui: what's it doing when you paste?
[23:14:12] <manicennui> dimadima: Condenses all of the white space and removes all newlines.
[23:14:44] <dimadima> weird i wonder why
[23:14:54] <dimadima> what if you paste it into a code block?
[23:15:00] <manicennui> That is what I was doing.
[23:15:04] <dimadima> lol
[23:15:04] <manicennui> Also tried preformatted.
[23:15:07] <manicennui> Then I gave up.
[23:15:23] <dimadima> yeaah that's a good give-up-asap thing
[23:15:39] <dimadima> i don't know if i believe the 30 vax thing
[23:15:59] <dimadima> like, your blood can be thick from antibodies bur you're alive and cogent? not sure about that
[23:16:30] <dimadima> companion_cube: yeah that makes sense
[23:16:53] <dimadima> that's probably just someone making fun of vaccine ppl
[23:17:59] <dimadima> my mom's coworker who has only one kidney went to lunch w/ a coworker a few months ago, got covid and ended up in the ICU
