[01:09:55] <FromGitter> <mcp292> When typing `"`, `'`, `(`, etc. the closing character is automatically inserted (what's the name for this?). The thing is, I don't know how to move to the end of the line in insert mode, and hitting `ESC A` is a bit much. So I often just type the closing character, defeating the purpose of the auto-insert. What am I missing?
[01:13:30] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> That feature is usually called smartparens.  In Emacs it is, at least on my system, managed by `electric-pair-mode`.

[02:44:30] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Thank you! Is there a better method than just using it as a hint and typing the closing character?
[02:45:46] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> Are you trying to move point to the end of the line, or just after the closing character?

[06:19:48] <FromGitter> <jamesrcole_twitter> hi, I just switched from the master to develop, and was wondering if there's a description anywhere of what's different from a user perspective? I haven't been able to find any details.
