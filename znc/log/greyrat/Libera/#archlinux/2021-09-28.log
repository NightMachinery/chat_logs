[01:03:39] <ktinos89> oh another question. coming from gentoo, and compiling my kernel manually, i never used an initramfs, on initrd ram disk. can i achieve the same in arch? also is there any advantage to using or not an initramfs? (if i make a custom kernel and builtin the things i need only)
[01:03:55] <ktinos89> rcf yes i figured that

[01:05:50] <rcf> ktinos89: it's recommended because it Just Works™ for 99.9% of people who aren't messing about with custom kernels. 
[01:06:20] <ktinos89> does it protect me, if the module is problematic? some people suggest modular approach, to avoid builting in, weird things in the kernel

[05:24:42] <bhava> removing the kitty config completely has the same result.  bg colours change the reflect the settings from wpgtk, but text remains white
[05:25:49] <brookesy66> weird... I don't use kitty myself but the only thing I've played around with for setting terminal colours other than pywal has been using dircolors to set the LS_COLORS variabl
[05:27:14] <bhava> if i set the color 15 in wpgtk to something, kitty accepts that. (so i think it wasnt actually white before, it was wpgtk's white for each of its themes, which is always very close to #ffffff)
[05:27:38] <bhava> even though the text color in kitty config is set to 14.. something always forces it to use color15

[07:54:20] <SheWhoExists> Scimmia: I have no idea how to go about setting that up. Every time I've used rEFInd I've had to feed it a stub I generated and it doesn't like my arch stub right now. Wiki doesn't seem to have anything either, just detecting existing EFI entries
[07:54:45] <Scimmia> SheWhoExists: refind doesn't look at the efi entries at all
[07:55:16] <Scimmia> the wiki tells you exactly how to set it up, either for automatic detection or with a manual config
[07:55:22] <SheWhoExists> I meant the files in the /efi folder, not the NVRAM efi entries. Sorry for not specifying

[11:32:14] <thecodingowl> Hi dear people, I have a strange problem with my wireless connection on this machine and am trying to figure out what is wrong with it, but I'm kinda out of idea what to check. I am pretty sure there is something wrong with my network configuration and need some hints where to look to find the stuff that goes wrong here. Maybe someone of you can help me further where to look. I also created a forum thread where I described the is
[11:32:17] <thecodingowl> more detail and where seth helped me already, but I would like to ask here too. Thank you in advance :-)
[11:32:33] <thecodingowl> I may should share the link to the forum :-D https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=269837

[14:18:32] <berber> the only thing i don't want are popups.  i mean, maybe i can disable popups in dunst and just pipe the notifications somehow into my script...?

[19:04:35] <skeemer> Dan39, yes
[19:04:37] <Namarrgon> fetch the PKGBUILD, modify it to your liking and rebuild the package
[19:04:53] <skeemer> Namarrgon, okok
[19:04:54] <Namarrgon> you will have to do this after every upstream update to this package

[19:09:39] <baltazar> doesn't matter, I want to do a fresh install anyway

[19:15:25] <baltazar> if I understand correctly, both zfs and fscrypt are able to achieve this, and I'm wondering which one is better (not sure about my metric, faster / easier / more secure)

[19:15:45] <Namarrgon> picking zfs just for encryption seems a bit like overkill
[19:15:56] <baltazar> also, I don't have much experience with zfs, I know it has many other useful features like snapshots
[19:15:58] <jelle> and additional pain for free
[19:16:10] <baltazar> yea that's why I'm asking
[19:16:46] <shem> i dunno, zfs works nicely for me
[19:16:57] <baltazar> I probably won't need snapshots on this system anyway, and ext4 has been working just fine so far, so might as well stick with it and use fscrypt
