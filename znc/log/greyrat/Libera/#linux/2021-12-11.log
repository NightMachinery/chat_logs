[07:29:11] <Shortstop> vt0 its not the seating of the disk
[07:29:14] <Shortstop> that's the thing
[07:29:21] <Shortstop> so RIGHT before the debian 11 installation
[07:29:26] <Shortstop> it detects that disk no problem
[07:29:42] <Shortstop> so I think it might be Odroid HC-4's version of Debian 11 not detecting it for some reason
[07:29:49] <ayecee> did it detect the disk after the problem first happened
[07:29:56] <Shortstop> otherwise, both this computer and the odroid itself can detect it no problem
[07:30:08] <Shortstop> yep it detected it before and after
[07:30:14] <ayecee> ok
[07:31:01] <Shortstop> maybe its a driver thing. Anyway, just frustrated since I deliberately bought a micro sd for this stupid thing since it literally only has 1 USB port and was booting into the SSD 50% of the time so I was advise to just opt for a microSD card instead
[07:31:34] <Shortstop> I wish you could just flash it and not have to deal with their version of Debian 11 to be honest. However, one thing I didn't consider is to maybe just try installing Debian 10 instead via the installer

[10:11:54] <tirnanog> namkeleser: stepping back for a moment, if you replace the body of your script with a simple echo "hello world"; does the same request still result in 403 or does it then work?
[10:12:11] <dviola> should I also enable TRIM on NVME drives?
[10:12:13] <tirnanog> the point being to check that the request is being processed in the way that it should be, at first.
[10:12:25] <dviola> or is it mostly for regular SSDs?
[10:12:28] <Dagmar> dviola: Yes.
[10:12:46] <mlu> PHP stores the actual info on the server side (details configurable), but the user just gets a single cookie that identifies their session store

[10:13:35] <mlu> put it this way: if you set $_SESSION['foo'] before returning results, then you can load that value back up in $_SESSION['foo'] on another PHP page load (if the session cookie was provided by the client)
[10:13:46] <Dagmar> It won't break anything, and hte controller and driver generally "figgers it out"
[10:13:54] <namkeleser> mlu So what should the value of $_SESSION be in this case to echo $idek

[10:20:45] <lockywolf> Dagmar, but the song is nice
[10:20:51] <Dagmar> lockywolf: The problem here is "a complete lack of understanding programming fundamentals".
[10:20:51] <mlu> namkeleser: it doesn't seem to be enabled on your server: have you reloaded / restarted it?
[10:21:22] <lockywolf> I've been programming for 15 years, and I am still sh*t at it.
[10:21:42] <namkeleser> mlu yes i have
[10:21:55] <mlu> setting up PHP can be daunting to the inexperienced programmer today: there's just too many layers of fundamental understand you need
[10:22:14] <mlu> namkeleser: it's not working correctly in that case
[10:22:15] <Dagmar> It's trivial to anyone who can Google.
[10:22:32] <mlu> Dagmar: they have to be able to follow instructions too :)
[10:22:42] <Dagmar> You can literally google "Install PHP for <Distribution> using <Webserver>" and get a guide
[10:23:04] <Dagmar> Explaining to your parents that you're now programming in PHP without being disowned...
[10:23:07] <Dagmar> ....that's the real challenge.

[10:23:35] <mlu> namkeleser: do you care more about setting up the webserver or just doing some PHP?
[10:23:41] <Dagmar> That having been said, I just use perl.  ;)
[10:23:43] <namkeleser> the goal is to get the flag
[10:23:49] <mlu> namkeleser: I suggest you follow Dagmar's advice on this and google that up
[10:23:57] <mlu> namkeleser: why do you care about that flag?
[10:24:05] <namkeleser> as its a challenge?
[10:24:16] <namkeleser> a literal challenge
[10:24:27] <Dagmar> It seriosuly just takes like 5-10 minutes to turn on PHP with any given distro-packaged webserver
[10:24:27] <mlu> namkeleser: do you even understand the challenge? you just want to echo out an nginx flag?
[10:24:29] <namkeleser> the goal is to get the flag
[10:24:32] <tirnanog> taking on board the wisdom of others might also be considered a challenge.
[10:24:57] <namkeleser> as i understand it theres a vulnerability
[10:25:12] <mlu> namkeleser: in that case, I'd use this: return 200 $flag;
[10:25:13] <namkeleser> the SESSION uses the same sha1 hash
[10:25:15] <namkeleser> idek
[10:25:33] <Dagmar> You have not yet _begun_ to see vulnerabilities in PHP
[10:25:50] <namkeleser> Dagmar so you are saying this is secure code?
[10:25:51] <mlu> namkeleser: which flag of where? is that an nginx, PHP, or something else flag that you're talking about?
[10:26:02] <namkeleser> the flag hidden on the server
[10:26:08] <namkeleser> within the $flag variable
[10:26:09] <Dagmar> namkeleser: The cookies and milk web page?
[10:26:16] <Dagmar> It doesn't _do_ anything
[10:26:19] <mlu> namkeleser: this isn't gentle, but Dagmar is saying that you don't understand the problem to even be qualified to do a security review
[10:26:19] <Dagmar> How can it not be secure?
[10:26:20] <namkeleser> Dagmar yes
[10:26:28] <mlu> namkeleser: and I'm in agreement with Dagmar here
[10:26:50] <Dagmar> If you want to see PHP vulnerabilities, just install Wordpress and don't touch it for like a year.
[10:26:54] <namkeleser> check the cookie it sets in devtools

[16:04:11] <wyre> ok, I'll read about earlycon then, thank you PaulFertser 😜
[16:04:25] <PaulFertser> wyre: good luck. I suggest to check DT first, that's faster and easier.

[16:28:50] <tirnanog> lockywolf: there are various ways. the ts utility from moreutils is a notably convenient one.
[16:29:18] <rascul> linearbit if it's enough to see that data is being transferred over ssh, then any of the programs listed so far will do it
[16:30:17] <linearbit> For the future I do have a follow up question though - what would be a good solution for transferring files for which progress can be monitored on both ends of the transfer?
[16:30:37] <rascul> hrm i dunno about both ends

[17:07:46] <EtherMan> Specifically, Prometheus with the Node Exporter then since it's the servers themselves you're looking to monitor.

[17:46:23] <EtherMan> There's another example that I think hits closer to home for more people though. VPN providers. One of the biggest reasons people use commercial VPN services, is due to region locks. Those region locks are typically based on the IP's registered location, yet the whole point is that you use it from elsewhere. So yea, there's absolutely no guarantees of any IP being in the right place in any geo location service.

[19:16:43] <Dagmar> Mainly it's just easier for someone to not realize they screwed up their symlink
[19:16:57] <xx> impermanence: symbolic does not imply relative
[19:17:02] <xx> those are two separate concepts
[19:17:02] <impermanence> oh
[19:17:05] <EtherMan> impermanence: relative or absolute depends on how you give the destination, not of it's symbolic.
[19:17:32] <Dagmar> If someone's used "../dirname/blah" they might not realize that another change they just made means it's no longer in that place

[23:28:58] <dfcnvt> (Off topic)  Is it possible imdb will withhold on who will make an appearance in the movie?  Especially with Spiderman: No Way Home....I'm unsure if Tobey and other actors will make an appearance in it.

[23:30:36] <sudomann> lol
[23:30:47] <ananke> imdb is not in charge of casting
[23:31:33] <dfcnvt> Maybe not imdb...but a movie production that demands not to reveal this.

[23:32:22] <NyB> dfcnvt: "demand"? They can always just like, not share the actor list. And there are a _lot_ of uncredited appearances in films.
