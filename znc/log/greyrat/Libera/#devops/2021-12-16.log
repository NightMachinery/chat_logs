[00:05:03] <nakedeyes> my idea was to allocate a fixed % each month for donations to few appricated projects i often use. not much but regular donations. i would be amazing if companies could do the same and not because of PR but spirit of fairness.

[20:23:14] <kubblai> i worked at one place where an employee had slagged off an absolute bitch of a boss who was high. the boss then requested web logs from IT to try and work out who it was so they could fire them
[20:23:17] <bn_work> Anyone have any thoughts on RedHat's new UBI base images?  I'm assuming they are stable?  (Reading their docs on their standard image (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers#con_understanding-the-ubi-standard-images_assembly_types-of-container-images) but not really getting an idea of how big they are though...)
[20:23:54] <kubblai> this was on glassdoor i should say
[20:24:07] <bn_work> (unlike the minimal which says it's only 92MB (or 32MB compressed))
[21:19:29] <rawtaz> Dus10: what are your thoughts on pulumi?
[21:34:48] <Dus10> I think it is just a plain bad idea
[21:35:06] <Dus10> creating such a thing, sure it would feel super awesome
[21:35:23] <Dus10> but the patterns... I just don't think folks are interested in having such a thing
[21:35:33] <rawtaz> can you elaborate on what you mean a bit? :)
[21:35:46] <Dus10> well, standardization is important
[21:35:53] <rawtaz> i tak eit that you think in general its not the right way to go. but in what ways, whats a bad idea?
[21:36:08] <Dus10> choosing "any" language just dull the effectiveness, in my view
[21:36:20] <Dus10> I think we can learn from .NET, for instance
[21:36:22] <rawtaz> yeah it'll all be standardized when pulumi took all of terraform's market share :D
[21:36:33] <Dus10> all of these .NET languages....
[21:36:44] <Dus10> well, it eventually became C#
[21:36:47] <rawtaz> i never see much other than C# on .NET
[21:36:52] <Dus10> bye bye VB.NET
[21:37:00] <Dus10> whatever else has been out there
[21:37:10] <Dus10> documentation is always fragmented
[21:37:17] <Dus10> because it is written in one language
[21:37:27] <Dus10> if it is written for each, it is just more to maintain
[21:37:39] <Dus10> writing good documentation is a huge hurdle as it is
[21:37:56] <Dus10> learning Terraform and HCL is not a significant burden
[21:38:17] <Dus10> the argument that a professional programming doesn't have to learn some DSL... that isn't a problem that people have, in reality
[21:38:29] <Dus10> it is just how Pulumi is trying to differentiate themselves
[21:38:38] <Dus10> Terraform is standardized with HCL
[21:38:54] <Dus10> not only that, HCL knowledge helps with other Hashicorp tooling
[21:39:08] <Dus10> I am open to being wrong, but it just seems like it is a "marketing" thing
[21:39:24] <Dus10> and the CDK stuff that Hashicorp is doing is just a response to Pulumi
[21:39:33] <rawtaz> hmm CDK
[21:39:36] <Dus10> "let's make Pulumi's position irrelevant"
[21:40:19] <Dus10> and after the IPO, they now have a ton of cash to help solidify that
[21:40:20] <rawtaz> right that CDK
[21:40:28] <rawtaz> you mean hashicorp?
[21:40:32] <Dus10> yep
[21:40:39] <rawtaz> right
[21:40:40] <rawtaz> ok
[21:41:07] <Dus10> while I fully buy into the trope that "DevOps is culture"... I think that play has been used too much
[21:41:14] <Dus10> it is about the tools, too
[21:41:21] <rawtaz> i kind of feel the same or similar about pulumi. for one, im not keen on any of those languages for this type of declarations - neither of them are very fit for it i think. so i dont see much gain there. perhaps if some other lang was used it'd be different but then whats the point.
[21:41:31] <Dus10> and I just do it partially to be Devil's Advocate
[21:42:07] <Dus10> If I am a talented programmer... I could just create HCL with code...
[21:42:11] <Dus10> not a big deal
[21:42:22] <rawtaz> also, i too dont really see the "problem" with e.g. HCL. i dont see much of a problem to solve by building another set of wheels that in the end just do more or less the same thing. and i agree it just diversifies and creates unneeded redundancy, which i'd argue all the endless amounts of linux distros do too - i'd rather get rid of a lot of them
[21:42:32] <Dus10> I wrote a ColdFusion interpreter in PHP back in the day (not a great idea, but a fantastic exercise)
[21:42:52] <Dus10> yeah
[21:43:17] <rawtaz> however, at the same time, i often hear people being frustrated with TF, i cant name specifics but that it's limited or cumbersome when you have some more complex setups
[21:43:26] <Dus10> it is like this new JetBrains IDE to compete with VS Code
[21:43:29] <Dus10> why?
[21:43:50] <Dus10> I do what I consider some of the more complex scenarios with Terraform...
[21:43:52] <rawtaz> haha its probably the other way around, JetBrains was around a long time before VS Code :)
[21:43:56] <rawtaz> yeah
[21:43:59] <rawtaz> you probably do
[21:44:13] <Dus10> I don't imagine that someone that can pull it off with Python can't get their mind about HCL
[21:44:46] <Dus10> well, JetBrains announced a new IDE that they are making, that is specifically what I was talking about there
[21:44:56] <rawtaz> i dont think its about that, it's more about flexibility or something. not being able to access whatever in wherever in their plans or stuff, i dunno
[21:44:56] <Dus10> a new OSS IDE to compete with VS Code
[21:45:10] <Dus10> VS Code is already OSS (99%) and it has share
[21:45:15] <rawtaz> i just know that more people than some random folks have complained during the years ive seen terraform being discussed
[21:45:24] <rawtaz> oh ok, i didnt know that
[21:45:29] <rawtaz> yeah why the heck would they do that
[21:46:17] <Dus10> I think a lot of the people complaining about Terraform and HCL don't even have a programming background
[21:46:51] <Dus10> or they have a very minor background with PowerShell and/or Python and they wonder why, with their narrow background, doesn't Terraform behave exactly like the tool that they know
[21:47:44] <Dus10> that is my biggest complaint about Terraform is from a community perspective
[21:48:15] <Dus10> a ton of people without any programming background that have only learned Terraform and they try to shout down people that know better about the ideas that they bring up
[21:48:34] <rawtaz> mhm :)
[21:50:51] *** Quits: humky (~humky@user/humky) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:51:37] <rawtaz> generally speaking, are there any other "competitors" than terraform and pulumi in that space? i mean, that have a relevant user base and ecosystem
[21:53:01] <Dus10> not really that I am aware of
[21:53:06] <rawtaz> same here
[21:53:16] <Dus10> I have had some people reaching out to me about other stuff, but I haven't had the time to look into them
[21:53:47] <Dus10> I have someone with Spacelift reach out to me to work there...
[21:53:57] <Dus10> I don't know if it is a competitor or a tool that works with it
[21:54:23] <Dus10> Spinnaker, as well
[21:54:52] <rawtaz> oh man. if i go to spacelift.io i see their text on that front page and think "oh, you too? like all the other tens or even hundreds of services saying pretty much the same thing"
[21:55:04] <rawtaz> this is like linux distros - way too many, impossible to even tell a difference
[21:57:06] <Dus10> what I liken it to is when iSCSI-based SANs emerged
[21:57:16] <Dus10> they all had the exact same pitch
[21:57:34] <Dus10> "We're uniquely designed for iSCSI like nobody else (meaning, we aren't EMC)"
[21:57:44] <Dus10> yeah, you're all commonly unique... gotcha
[21:58:02] <Dus10> Equallogic, Lefthand, etc...
[21:58:05] <Dus10> they all had the same pitch
[21:58:14] <Dus10> "We're the only one..."
