[00:41:13] <senoraraton> So I'm trying to build my github project into a container.  I'm building off the node:slim image, and currently I just locally cloned the repo and used COPY to move it into the container.  Is it possible that I can write in the Dockerfile to just clone the repo as part of the container setup?

[00:54:45] <programmerq> senoraraton: yes, you can do that. there are a few ways. that SO question is specific to a private repository.
[00:55:01] <programmerq> it's mostly common to just check in your Dockerfile to the git repo and then do a clone and build from there.
[00:55:44] <programmerq> usually the private repo concern comes up when you're doing something like an 'npm install' or 'pip install' that hits a private repo.
[00:58:06] <programmerq> but most of those answers talk about the basic strategies anyway. You can skip the ssh key injection if it's a public repo.

[00:58:55] <senoraraton> I'm putting the clone in the Dockerfile.  I'm building a container for a friend, and I'm trying to keep it as fool proof for them as possible.  They have control of the repo, so they won't push malformed code, and I can write a script for them to rebuild the container easily.

[02:08:17] <BtbN> the old images will be "overwritten"

[11:02:24] <davit> So inside Docker inside my Docker image I am getting this error "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?" I am enabling docker with the command "RUN systemctl enable docker.service" inside my dockerfile but it does not seem to be carrying through. Using start instead of enable causes permissions issues

[11:04:44] <zoredache> Does your image even have systemd?  That is very uncommon and usually takes extra capabilities. Also do you really need the docker daemon to run inside the container? Why not just mount the docker socket from the host into the container?
[11:06:14] <nabidev> Have you mount with volume of your docker path like "-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"?

[11:12:02] <davit> So I am running docker in docker so I can use AWS Lambda to do some docker pull/push commands to replicate repos around a bit convoluted. I originally had the solution use Skopeo to do a Sync rather than Pull/Push but security has asked me to hold off since they need to approve the package first. But here I am not using docker inside docker to accomplish a similar goal. Docker is new to me so I am probably doing it inefficiently. 
[11:12:22] <davit> Base image is Amazon Linux 2 and does use systemd I believe
[11:12:53] <davit> Can I still mount the docker socket from the host into the container like you said in my situation? 
[11:15:48] <zoredache> Don't know lamda well enough to answer that. I probably would use regsync (https://github.com/regclient/regclient) to copy/push/pull images.
[11:16:18] <zoredache> But I would guess your security would want to review that also.
[11:16:47] <davit> Yea too late for that now
[11:16:56] <davit> But let me take a look at it anyway
[11:18:04] <zoredache> So are you trying to run a registry in the container you will have on lamda? Or just pull it, then push it to another registry?
[11:18:18] <zoredache> AFAIK, you shouldn't really need a docker daemon for that at all.
[11:19:07] <zoredache> I could be wrong though.

[11:25:24] <davit> Would doing this fix daemon issues? COPY files/docker/systemctl.py /usr/bin/systemctl
[11:26:47] <zoredache> Are you starting from amazonlinux:2 or something like that?  I don't see any systemd in that image.
[11:27:20] <zoredache> This shows no results `docker run --rm -it amazonlinux:2 find . -name '*systemd*' -type f`
[11:27:28] <davit> FROM amazon/aws-lambda-provided:al2
[11:28:45] <zoredache> that image also doesn't seem to have systemd in it.
[11:29:14] <davit> Hmm I could have sworn AL2 used systemd
[11:30:00] <davit> Amazon Linux 2 provides the systemd service and systems manager as opposed to System V init system in Amazon Linux AMI.
[11:30:04] <zoredache> Amazon Linux it self does, but docker images usually don't have systemd
[11:30:30] <davit> Ah my confusion makes sense
[11:30:33] <zoredache> Most people think docker containers should be a single process only, so there is no need to a init like systemd, sysvinit, or so on.

[11:32:26] <zoredache> You could possibly add something like supervisor or one of the basic init people sometimes use, but I am not sure how that would work for something like lambda where you usually want the container to only run until it is done, then exit.

[11:35:37] <zoredache> really think what you trying to do here is almost certainly the hardway and using something like regsync, or that other tool you mentioned would probably be far easier.
[11:36:54] <davit> I agree the other way was already complete and working end to end with no limitations. This method is a stopgap that has image size limitations and takes twice as long to complete when it is working.
[11:36:56] <zoredache> I suspect it also wouldn't be to hard if you had a minimal ec2 instance running docker.

[16:12:15] <ada_> registry-mirrors should be configured to point to a local registry, and that registry should be configured with the upstream registry addresses you would use

[17:34:04] <talin> hello. i have some containers that have stopped and i am wondering why. how can i see why they have exited?
[17:34:54] <programmerq> docker shows that the container is stopped if the main containerized process exits. you can see what that process output to stdout/stderr by using 'docker logs' and 'docker ps -a' should include the exit code that the containerized process set when it exited.

[17:45:12] <talin> hmm, the uptime is less than expected. looks like the power went out
[17:45:20] <programmerq> also docker inspect <container> has State information, including the ExitCode
[17:45:26] <programmerq> ah yeah, a power out issue would explain that
[17:45:44] <programmerq> you can just start the container again. you can also set a restart policy so docker will start it on startup.
[17:45:51] <talin> what was the best way to update a container? was it docker pull and then docker-compose up, for example?
[17:46:07] <tabakhase> or --pull up :P
[17:46:08] <programmerq> docker-compose up --pull -d
[17:46:25] <programmerq> and definitely toss in a restart policy into your compose file so it'll have that in place.

[17:47:03] <talin> programmerq: to make it start automatically or update, you mean?
[17:47:24] <programmerq> restart policy tells docker under what conditions to start an existing container

[20:49:47] <liquid-silence> Hi all, I am facing a small problem that I cannot seem to find a solution for, docker volumes on Mac are pretty slow, I am currently importing a 4GB database dump on startup of the container (without the volume it takes 10 minutes) with a volume for the data directory, it takes over an hour. If anyone has some idea on how I can speed up the volume it will be much appreciated
[20:50:36] <liquid-silence> I have looked at using delegated mode for the mount in the hope that it speeds up the import process.

[22:27:22] <thm> I wondered whether it is possible to modify seccomp.json so that it is compatible with qemu-6.X, and centos7' docker.
[22:27:55] <tianon> there's a "--seccomp-profile" flag to dockerd (and thus configurable in /etc/docker/daemon.json as well)

[22:29:05] <tianon> I don't think the change to allow "unconfined" globally there is in a release yet (might be wrong on that, but it was really recent), but you can emulate it with an empty profile if you want to do awful hacks like I've done in the past /o\
[22:29:43] <tianon> https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/42481
[22:31:06] <thm> ok, using an empty profile seems to work (although not ideal, I'd prefer to update the profile)
[22:31:38] <tianon> yeah, I bet there's only one or two items you'd have to update, but I'm definitely not an expert there :)
[22:31:51] <tianon> you might even be able to get away with just downloading a newer version of the default profile

[22:36:49] <Tach> Does anyone know how to remove empty repositories from a proviate v2 registry ?
[22:37:05] <Tach> I have a garbage collection but that doesn't remove the empty repos
[22:41:13] <thm> tianon: yeah, was looking e.g. at https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/42836, but that also modifies code.
[22:42:03] <tianon> ahhh right, that adds support for "errnoRet" which is otherwise not supported by 20.10 :(
[22:42:45] <tianon> I guess setting "clone3" to allow is probably less bad than setting the entire profile to unconfined? O:)

[22:45:43] <thm> maybe, but I stumbled across another problem (rpm not working in the container using qemu), and I am not sure how to find out which syscall that is
[22:46:27] <tianon> what I usually do is start a shell, use "docker top" to find the pid, then use strace from the host to attach to it (and children) so I can then run the broken thing
[22:46:52] <tianon> my guess is probably something like faccessat*
[22:47:23] <tianon> Tach: unfortunately, I don't think there's an "official" way to do that
[22:47:39] <thm> ok, might try that
[22:47:45] <Tach> tianon indeed there is not but how to see if they are truely empty ?
[22:48:23] <tianon> Tach: good question - I guess I'd check the directory of the repository in the filesystem if you're worried about dangling digests (which *can* be deleted via the API)
