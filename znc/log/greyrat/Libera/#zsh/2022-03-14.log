[20:19:50] <machabot> Some people, when confronted with a problem they "just have to" solve with shell, think: "I know, Ill apply the typical paradigms of language `X, which Im so fond of, to shell to solve the problem!" Now they have a broken solution and several questions only answerable by !paradigm

[20:24:20] <incal> indeed the zsh solution doesn't seem to come from any paradigm I'm familiar with ...
[20:25:19] <llua> but you came to a sensible solution in your opening question.
[20:30:42] <incal> yeah
[20:31:26] <incal> reboot and see if something br0ke ... probably not as nothing should have changed since these vars never were local anyway
[20:31:45] <incal> right if anything you could warn "hey, local doesn't make sense like that"
[20:31:49] <incal> anyway reboot

[22:25:53] <mehwork> how
[22:25:59] <llua> programming
[22:27:01] <mehwork> doesn't zsh have a built in way, i'm tryhing to remember but i thought it did
[22:27:32] <mehwork> glob qualifier way or something
[22:27:33] <Mikachu> can you read what you said, and then try to understand what you want based on that?

[23:56:32] <cassepipe> It can't work recursively ?
