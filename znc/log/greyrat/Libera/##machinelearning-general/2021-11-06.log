[00:47:57] <HuntsMan> yuri6037: did you fix the issue?
[00:49:18] <yuri6037> Oh yeah sorry I had a big issue with the machine where quassel core is running
[00:49:33] <yuri6037> and yes I did fix that issue
[00:50:46] <yuri6037> Just removed the code with val_images. I also had to apply a fix cause the original SRGAN had a bug in its PSNR implementation. The initial developer forgot that log(0) does not exist
[00:51:41] <yuri6037> And also initial dev didn't that you can arrange your dataset to have images which never contain any 255 value in any of its channel

[00:59:17] <HuntsMan> yuri6037: typical, so in the end there is no validation set?
[01:00:33] <yuri6037> There's still validation but I've disabled the code which stores a duplicate of the original dataset HR image region and th SR augmented region
[01:01:24] <HuntsMan> ah ok
[01:01:29] <HuntsMan> so in the end it was a memory issue ;)
[01:01:33] <yuri6037> The initial dev apparently had a saving system which saved ALL SR and HR regions back to a file. The problem is this code was built to keep all images first in RAM before it could write to disk
[01:02:05] <HuntsMan> yeah that makes no sense, just write to disk as yo ugo
[01:03:52] <yuri6037> that worked fine with his initial dataset loading which only cuts a random region out of each dataset image. I have changed this because network performance was like 30 PSNR and 0.92 0.93 SSIM which is absolutely catastriphic compared to SAN. So when I found his amazing random "feature" I though "I don't like randoms let me make this with my great image decomposition"
[01:05:05] <yuri6037> but well I didn't see this other part of the code which keeps ALL upscaled images in RAM before saving to disk. I've removed that and now it no longer blows up the machine
[01:05:46] <HuntsMan> super
[01:05:48] <yuri6037> It doesn't matter if the results are not saved while training cause I have a separate testing process which uses my own data set and my own measuring scripts
[01:06:25] <yuri6037> and I can trust the measuring script as it uses scikit image for PSNR and SSIM so sure this one is correct
[01:07:08] <yuri6037> I don't trust the random measuring libs that I find in some of these networks
[01:08:13] <yuri6037> Right now with my image decomposition I've improved network to 0.97 SSIM
[01:08:43] <yuri6037> epoch 5 only. the previous one ran for 100 epochs and had 0.95 at the end
[01:09:27] <yuri6037> maybe the slight change now is it takes approx 2-3 hours for just 1 epoch
[01:09:48] <yuri6037> before it took maybe 30 minutes for 1 epoch
[01:10:52] <yuri6037> but honnestly if it's for 30 minutes per epoch and a PSNR 30 SSIM 0.5 vs SSIM 0.97 but waiting many hours I prefer the later one
[01:11:04] <yuri6037> *0.95
[01:11:34] <yuri6037> My research requires photo-realistic SISR
