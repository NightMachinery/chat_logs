[01:37:51] <kish`> anonymous, is it safer to get the apk directly from the electrum site than getting it from the gplay store?
[01:38:50] <anonymous> yes
[01:38:53] <anonymous> much safer
[01:39:11] <kish`> i am wondering if google bundles stuff with the apk's they release
[01:40:57] <anonymous> don't trust Google or any other app store, if you want something either compile it yourself or use the latest official releases from the developers website

[09:55:35] <GlobalBanksta> what's wrong?
[09:58:05] <buZz> sounds like you converted the file while copying along?
[09:59:58] <dodo> um, what mind of wallet?
[10:03:02] <GlobalBanksta> I'm sorry, mind of wallet?

[10:03:29] <buZz> kind*
[10:03:34] <GlobalBanksta> bitcoin wallet
[10:03:46] <buZz> GlobalBanksta: that obviously wasnt the question
[10:04:14] <GlobalBanksta> how should i know if 'mind' was some new word you bitcoiners have started using :/
[10:04:29] <buZz> a) what file do you have b) for which software c) why is it gifting you unicode errors, bitcoincore doesnt do unicode
[10:05:48] <GlobalBanksta> I have a few wallet.dat's for whatever main bitcoin client was used in 2011. I'm using electrum
[10:06:02] <buZz> you cannot open bitcoin core wallet.dat in electrum, clearly
[10:06:08] <GlobalBanksta> what must i do
[10:06:27] <GlobalBanksta> I'm kind of an old newbie
[10:06:30] <buZz> research, sounds like
[10:06:33] <GlobalBanksta> ok
[10:06:38] <buZz> :)
[10:06:49] <buZz> you can open bitcoin core wallet.dat in bitcoin core, fyi
[10:07:03] <GlobalBanksta> yeah but
[10:07:17] <GlobalBanksta> I tried that before but I didn't have the space for the blockchain
[10:07:19] <GlobalBanksta> but now I do have that space
[10:07:21] <GlobalBanksta> :)
[10:07:34] <buZz> you dont even need the space for the blockchain
[10:07:50] <buZz> just run it, open the wallet , then while syncing export the private keys
[10:07:56] <buZz> -THOSE- you can import into electrum
[10:08:10] <buZz> no need to finish syncing
[10:08:59] <GlobalBanksta> sigh
[10:10:57] <GlobalBanksta> let me take this moment to let you all know how much i hate satoshi
[10:11:10] <buZz> why?
[10:11:24] <GlobalBanksta> i don't like billionaires
[10:12:39] <buZz> and?
[10:12:54] <buZz> 'dont like' and 'hate' are quite different things, imho
[10:13:32] <GlobalBanksta> okay i misspoke i just don't like him
[10:13:49] <GlobalBanksta> bitcoin changed everything and everyone is every bitter they didn't hop on the train early
[10:13:52] <GlobalBanksta> except i did hop on early
[10:14:20] <buZz> ok
[10:14:27] <buZz> just didnt learn enough to know how to use it ;)
[10:14:35] <GlobalBanksta> i used it
[10:14:40] <GlobalBanksta> i was a major trader on mtgox
[10:14:49] <GlobalBanksta> in 2011
[10:15:18] <GlobalBanksta> we used to make jokes in 2011 that btc would be worth $1M some day
[10:15:30] <GlobalBanksta> I made that joke, but it was only a half joke
[10:15:47] <GlobalBanksta> i'm trying to download the snap for bitcoin-core
[10:15:57] <GlobalBanksta> but what i really want is the appimage, if there is such a thing
[10:16:44] <buZz> i wouldnt recommend getting third party packaged wallets
[10:16:50] <buZz> thats a opsec error
[10:17:06] <GlobalBanksta> not if they're gpg signed obviosuly
[10:17:12] <GlobalBanksta> who trusts any code any way
[10:18:34] <buZz> you do ;) 07:45:30 < GlobalBanksta> I made that joke, but it was only a half joke

Would you do a binary decision on the transaction-level based on whether one or more Taproot outputs are created or spent (like for segwit)? Or does something on the txout level make more sense? (e.g., the vbyte ratio of spent and created Taproot txouts vs. all txouts)
[11:06:45] <virtu> Or simpler for the txout level: use the ratio of the number of spent and created Taproot txouts vs. all txouts in a block

[18:45:26] <s17> if your wallet doesn't ask any personal information, that is better than one which doesn't, but that doesn't mean it is trusted and/or secure
[18:45:31] <s17> you have to do your own research
[18:45:46] <skidd0> is your ?q query something for a chat bot or just some joke
[18:46:04] <s17> it's part of a web search engine query

[22:58:14] <linux_dream> hi people, I need a bitcoin guru to answer some of my questions about BTC
[22:58:47] <linux_dream> for example, about mining. as far as I understand it, everyone tries to mine the next block, but there's a winner only every 10 minutes in average, or something like that
[22:59:29] <linux_dream> if that's the case, then how can someone with a gpu at home, expect to win some of the times, if he competes with massive gpu and other farms?  it doesn't make sense. what am I missing?
[23:00:24] <linux_dream> coz I have read that people can still make money for example in argentina where electricity is paid in part by the state.  so it's kinda cheap. and letting run a single gpu does earn you some money per month
[23:00:58] <linux_dream> how is that possible?  there are only 6 * 24 blocks mined by day, and a single gpu cannot expect to win more than say, once in 100 millions
[23:01:09] <linux_dream> so what am I missing?
[23:05:07] *** Quits: varioust (~varioust@72-46-48-28.lnk.ne.static.allophone.net) (Quit: varioust)
[23:05:33] <anonymous> Pools, you missing pools
[23:05:48] <PaperSwordIRC> you 'could' mine a block with a GPU but the odds are impossibly low now. The reason being that the calculation to mine a block is quite small and easy to do with the caveat that getting the right answer out of it is quite hard. So the way to solve this problem is to do this calculation with as many times as possible per 10mins.
[23:06:04] *** Joins: varioust (~varioust@72-46-48-28.lnk.ne.static.allophone.net)
[23:06:41] <linux_dream> right, so how do people earn a few cents a month using a gpu?
[23:06:49] <linux_dream> if they never mine the next block
[23:06:59] <anonymous> mining pools, how many times I hate to say
[23:07:07] <anonymous> have
[23:07:32] <PaperSwordIRC> The pool sums the total number of calculations you did relative to the total and pays you a percent based on that if the pool finds a block.
[23:07:56] <linux_dream> ahhhh I see. thanks. interesting
[23:07:59] <PaperSwordIRC> A GPU will always be 0% now a days and never even meet the threshold for a withdrawal.
[23:08:16] <linux_dream> so everyone gets some rewards even though they were not the luckiest
[23:08:32] <linux_dream> even though the lucky dude gets his money splits into thousands. I get it, I guess
[23:08:34] <PaperSwordIRC> Yeah, based on how much work they did as a part of the whole.
[23:08:45] <PaperSwordIRC> Yep!
[23:08:50] <linux_dream> perfect, thanks a lot!
[23:09:01] <linux_dream> oh and another question now that I'm at it
[23:09:14] <AndyS2_> linux_dream: the pool asks you to mine on their block header, so if you find a hash that has enough 0es, you cannot use it for your own block, as it's a hash for their block header
[23:09:26] <PaperSwordIRC> you can mine a whole block with a GPU if you wanted too but the odds are so close to zero death will likely happen first. plus you would waste a lot of energy
[23:10:04] <linux_dream> after the year 2130 when no more BTC will be mined, it is said the fees are going to pay the "miners"  .  but.... they are mining anymore? what the hell?  I mean, logically, they should still be adding new blocks to the blockchain, right?
[23:10:12] <AndyS2_> linux_dream: at the same time, when you do hash their header, there will be times when you find a block hash that doesn't have enough 0es to make a valid next bitcoin block, but it will be good enough to prove to the mining pool that you are indeed trying to find a hash for them. so even if you never actually find a block, they can estimate how much you are helping them find one, and pay you ...
[23:10:18] <AndyS2_> ... accordingly
[23:11:50] <PaperSwordIRC> Yes they will be adding more blocks to the chain, though there is no base reward, the miner/pool will get all the fees paid for UTXOs that went into their block
[23:11:51] <AndyS2_> linux_dream: miners have to pay their electricity and new hardware bills. if there is no reward, they'd go bankrupt pretty soon, probably. but if the reward is high enough from the fees alone, it's not much different from now (with some protections needed so it doesn't look more juicy to remine an older block, I guess)
[23:12:33] <PaperSwordIRC> @AndyS2_ are you familiar with bitcoin script?
[23:13:29] <linux_dream> I understand AndyS2_ .   but i had read that no more BTC will be mined.  I guess this does not mean that no more blocks will be added.  it just means that they won't get a base reward as you say, but there will still be miners to add blocks

[23:17:52] <linux_dream> I am worried only about 1 thing in the long term future of BTC.  it's compared to algorand or ethereum and others like that, about the energetic use.   that's my only concern.  people might abandon slowly but surely BTC if it sticks with PoW.
[23:18:43] <PaperSwordIRC> PoW is what makes bitcoin real... To create bitcoin requires energy.
[23:20:06] <linux_dream> I agree, this settles an intrisec price, in some way
[23:20:14] <PaperSwordIRC> To make changes to the bitcoin network requires an insane amount of energy, thus bitcoin is resilient though the cost of attack. PoS are prone to failure though centralization or malicious actors.
[23:20:30] <linux_dream> but nowadays and in the future, people are really concerned about energy consumption, too.
[23:21:02] <AndyS2_> linux_dream: there's problems with other consensus systems, some of them are described in links on https://endthefud.org/PoW
[23:21:18] <linux_dream> thank you for the reg, AndyS2_ . I am going to check it out
[23:21:53] <AndyS2_> linux_dream: short version: things either devolve into PoW (say with stuff that requires hdd space instead), or there's 'nothing at stake'
[23:21:54] <linux_dream> now, is there something else than energy usage that could settle an intrinsec price to BTC?
[23:21:58] <linux_dream> and do we really need it
[23:22:19] <PaperSwordIRC> Then why do these people still drive cars and eat meat? Humans determined the benefit to outweigh the cost. Bitcoin will replace banks, paper shuffling, middle men, and so much more. So as a society mining will be determined to be worth it
[23:22:21] <AndyS2_> in a way, a world where PoS becomes the norm there can't be just one PoS chain IMO. there will be thousands. there's no reason why there shouldn't be
[23:23:10] <PaperSwordIRC> @AndyS2_ Our world as we know it runs on PoS and we know how that works.
[23:23:45] *** maverick is now known as maverick|zz
[23:24:07] <AndyS2_> linux_dream: it's not the price, but the security that is secured through PoW. and as you just learned, fees will pay for all bitcoin miners. thus it can't pollute the planet more than fees are paid for it. I think it's unreasonable to imagine a world where fees eat up a huge percentage of all commerce worldwide, so maybe they stay reasonable, and thus the energy consumption stays reasonable
[23:24:35] <PaperSwordIRC> @AndyS2_ I agree
[23:24:36] <linux_dream> PaperSwordIRC:, nowadays, since few BTC are left to be mined compared to 21 millions, adding more cpu power does not increase much decentralization, right?  not as in the early days
[23:24:42] <linux_dream> is this correct?
[23:25:06] <AndyS2_> decentralization is not about who owns the coins, but who protects the rules of bitcoin I'd say
[23:25:14] <linux_dream> oh
[23:25:31] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:25:55] <PaperSwordIRC> decentralization of mining is about how much hash power each participant has.
[23:26:00] <AndyS2_> you want many people doing that, so not everybody can be strong-armed into messing with the system through attacks and advertising for dumb changes
[23:26:02] <PaperSwordIRC> So a CPU miner will do nothing.
[23:27:17] <PaperSwordIRC> CPU = Pellet Gun, GPU = Rifle, FPGA = Rocket Launcher, ASIC = Nuclear Bomb
[23:28:06] <linux_dream> so it's best to have an FPGA to launch the ASIC unless one wants to explode with an ASIC alone
[23:28:37] <PaperSwordIRC> I was mostly trying to frame is as total amount of power.
[23:28:55] <linux_dream> yeah and i tried to joke :)  not good enough

[23:30:22] <PaperSwordIRC> you are correct...
[23:30:28] <linux_dream> alright and another question
[23:30:48] <PaperSwordIRC> I have watch more people fuck up using hardware wallets than I have watch fuck up seed phrases
[23:31:15] <linux_dream> they are used only to sign transactions as far as I know, so i guess they save a file that is then transfered to a connected to the internet computer which then communicates in some way with the blockchain and give the information of a transaction that must be valided in the next block
[23:31:21] *** Joins: FreeRangeDillo (~Kurt@136.49.102.16)
[23:31:57] <linux_dream> how exactly do you "communicate" to the blockchain?
[23:32:19] <PaperSwordIRC> Yep, user enters pin/code then the device constructs a transaction. The transaction is broadcast via the wallet to other wallets.
[23:33:30] <linux_dream> well you must have a PC connected to the internet with some software or something like that, something that can use your signed file, send it or send the information to the blockchain in some way (I guess the private key???)
[23:33:47] <linux_dream> not sure what the signature is
[23:33:52] <linux_dream> if it's not the private key
[23:33:59] <AndyS2_> AFAIK a hardware wallet has a very small, defined way to communicate with it. through that it gets presented with an unsigned transaction, which it then cryptographically signs with your private keys if you think the transaction looks ok. that signed transaction can be given to other nodes, they propagate it on the p2p network, and miners pick it up and potentially put it into their next mined ...
[23:34:05] <AndyS2_> ... block if it is correct and pays enough fee
[23:34:13] <PaperSwordIRC> The signature is a hash of the private key.
[23:34:26] <linux_dream> thank you
[23:34:29] <PaperSwordIRC> So your private key never gets broadcast the the network.
[23:34:29] <AndyS2_> no, the signature is not a hash of the private key
[23:34:33] <PaperSwordIRC> Wrong?
[23:34:45] <linux_dream> the hash looks OK to me
[23:34:50] <linux_dream> ah
[23:34:54] <PaperSwordIRC> P2SH?
[23:34:58] <AndyS2_> in easy terms, the secret key allows you to create a signature which can be proven correct with a public key that everybody may know
[23:35:21] <PaperSwordIRC> Andy is correct ^^^
[23:35:23] <linux_dream> yeah but what is the signature then?  a hash looked good to me
[23:36:07] <linux_dream> and how do you propagate this into the p2p network? (sorry for these questions)
[23:36:29] <PaperSwordIRC> I like them TBH, a test of my knowledge
[23:36:41] <PaperSwordIRC> I want to learn as much as possible

[23:37:59] <PaperSwordIRC> I only know for bitcoin core, but when your node receives a TX it then sends a broadcast of the TX to the other nodes it's connected to.

[23:39:49] <AndyS2_> someone better at explaining ECDSA here? Maybe it's not completely wrong to say that a signature is a number that, combined with the message and public key in some way, can be checked for a certain quality. If that quality holds true, the signature is valid.
[23:40:18] <AndyS2_> And you can only create such numbers if you know the private key, or if ECDSA is broken ^^
[23:40:22] <linux_dream> what you wrote makes sense, even though ECDSA is not detailed
[23:40:34] <PaperSwordIRC> Agreed
[23:41:08] <PaperSwordIRC> @AndyS2 I created a bc1p address.... and now I don't know how to spend from it.
[23:41:11] <linux_dream> kinda of fascinating
[23:41:28] <linux_dream> well thanks people
[23:41:32] <PaperSwordIRC> ofc

[23:44:32] <Nicolas211> Hi, i am getting error with walletnotify, i have no idea what is wrong. debug log shows this: runCommand error: system(/usr/local/php /home/web/script.php XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_tx_id_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) returned 256
[23:45:33] <Nicolas211> If i run it myself it executes fine, path is good.
[23:50:37] <PaperSwordIRC> what about the space after php?
[23:51:41] <Nicolas211> ./usr/local/php < this is php bin file
[23:51:54] <PaperSwordIRC> sorry mb
[23:54:36] <PaperSwordIRC> Exit 256 maps to 1, are the issue is either in the parameters or script exe
[23:55:32] <Nicolas211> exact same command from debug.log runs fine if i manually run it
