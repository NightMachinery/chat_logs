[00:21:56] <LeoNerd> Folks: Why can I not map <Esc> separately to <C-[>
[00:22:02] <clason[m]> interesting
[00:22:18] <LeoNerd> I thought this was *THE NUMBER ONE* reason for nvim in the first place - to fix a lot of that terminal input queue crap
[00:22:26] *** Joins: just1602 (~weechat@user/just1602)
[00:22:47] <LeoNerd> libtermkey will tell you Escape vs. printing '[' with the Ctrl modifier turned on. pangoterm will send it in a way that is distinct
[00:22:53] <LeoNerd> nvim is not doing the right thing with that information
[00:23:01] <clason[m]> One crap at a time...
[00:25:15] <clason[m]> PR welcome, I'm sure
[00:26:14] <LeoNerd> No

[00:26:29] <LeoNerd> I'm maintaining the entire terminal library base, plus an entire programming language, plus about 50 other side-projects
[00:26:46] <clason[m]> I'm sorry, I was confused
[00:26:47] <LeoNerd> I do not have time to learn the entire internals of how nvim works on top of all that. There are not enough hours in the day nor enough space in my head
[00:26:49] <clason[m]> Complaining welcome, I meant.

[00:27:25] <LeoNerd> I will be happy to explain in as much detail as anyone needs, how to interpret the information that libtermkey will give to nvim, so that youfolks can work that out for yourselves
[00:27:51] <LeoNerd> However, I notice that that isn't sufficient to solve the problem
[00:28:18] <LeoNerd> In nvim, if I  :imap <Esc> ONE  |  :imap <C-[> TWO  then I notice that both mappings collide; nvim seems to think I wanted to   :imap <ESC> TWO
[00:28:32] <LeoNerd> This is nothing to do with libtermkey, and entirely to do with how nvim stores that mapping information
[00:29:32] <clason[m]> Yes.
[00:29:44] <clason[m]> That is documented
[00:30:03] <clason[m]> As in, complain to Bram plz.
[00:30:04] <LeoNerd> It was documented about real vim 30 years ago
[00:30:19] <LeoNerd> It's why I complained and why I was part of the original mutiny that created nvim *in the first place*
[00:30:32] <LeoNerd> I discussed it with Taruda at length, right from the start
[00:31:03] <clason[m]> Sorry that he chose jobs as the thing to work on first.
[00:31:10] <LeoNerd> This was why tarruda switched to using my libtermkey :)

[00:33:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> they're probably unaware of the issue completely
[00:33:31] <clason[m]> I'm sure you of all people can offer helpful information.
[00:35:07] <LeoNerd> Let me go hunt all the bugs then
[00:35:30] <clason[m]> You can just open a new issue
[00:35:39] <clason[m]> if it's a duplicate, maintainers can handle it
[00:35:40] <LeoNerd> I'd prefer to find all the existing ones
[00:35:46] <LeoNerd> since I'm quite sure I have talked about this several times before
[00:35:54] <clason[m]> sure, if that is less work to you
[00:36:10] <LeoNerd> It's ultimately less work as it involves less duplicated typing on my part

[00:50:03] <clason[m]> Yes, as I wrote, that's documented behavior.
[00:50:27] <LeoNerd> Then my request becomes "can it please not?"
[00:50:33] <clason[m]> If you'd like that changed, it would help to put that officially on the record.
[00:50:49] <LeoNerd> Yes I felt I had done that repeatedly
[00:51:08] <LeoNerd> In fact, I felt that I had done that from all the way back before neovim was even officially a thing.
[00:51:17] <clason[m]> I'm sorry, but not a record I can access.
[00:51:46] <clason[m]> Which means probably many other eager contributors can't access that, either.
[00:51:48] <clason[m]> Which means it won't happen.
[00:51:59] <LeoNerd> Righty. So.. can you suggest me a title for this bug?
[00:52:24] <LeoNerd> It's an annoyance I've held for so long and argued with Bram so many times I just get annoyed every time I go near it, and end up in a shouty rant. so I'm unable to write about it very calmly
[00:52:35] <clason[m]> It's not a bug, per se, but a feature request.
[00:52:46] <clason[m]> You know best what you want to happen.
[00:53:15] <LeoNerd> I want that after I :map two different keys, nvim remembers them both, as two separate keys. Not smushing them together into one
[00:53:21] <clason[m]> (I never had the urge to map `<c-[>` -- quite the opposite, in fact)
[00:53:46] <clason[m]> I'd keep it short, then.
[00:53:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> same. It's a hypothetical frustration, no?
[00:53:51] <LeoNerd> C-[ is a very useful key, because it's one of the veryfew graphically handed pairs.. only [] {} <> are very convenient to type. () possibly too
[00:54:06] <LeoNerd> sunjonSenghanBri: it's an indication of a much deeper problem

[00:54:23] <clason[m]> Say "here's two keys; I'd like to map them to different things, and I currently can't. I know that's how Vim rolls, but maybe we can change that?"

[00:54:46] <clason[m]> LeoNerd: Yeah, for you maybe. For me it's instant finger pretzels.
[00:54:48] <LeoNerd> (or Ctrl-J, I forget which)
[00:55:31] <clason[m]> LeoNerd: But I don't think there's a single underlying cause, so each of these (intentional) collisions has to be untangled individually.
[00:55:41] <LeoNerd> There is a single underlying cause
[00:55:46] <clason[m]> Hence individual issues are helpful.
[00:55:52] <bfredl> LeoNerd: we all agree that we want this. what is needed is the Hard Actual Work to fix it one case at a time.
[00:55:59] <bfredl> recently zeer fixed one such case.
[00:56:15] <bfredl> at least documenting cases that is not yet documented in an issue helps
[00:56:17] <clason[m]> LeoNerd: If you say "Bram", I will punch you.
[00:56:35] <LeoNerd> No... the single underlying cause is you have a *byte* queue for input
[00:56:47] <clason[m]> (Not really. It's exactly what I would have said.)
[00:56:48] <LeoNerd> Ideally you need a *keypress* queue, but that's a big engineering effort
[00:57:10] <gegoune[m]> bfredl: which case was recently fixed?
[00:57:10] <bfredl> LeoNerd: we already have that just fine.
[00:57:21] <LeoNerd> Then maybe the problem is the way the LHS of maps are parsed
[00:57:25] <bfredl> we need to fix the detailed rules for how that byte to keypress conversion works
[00:57:34] <LeoNerd> Why do you have those rules?
[00:57:37] <LeoNerd> That's what libtermkey gives you
[00:57:46] <clason[m]> Because Bram.
[00:57:58] <LeoNerd> I -even- implemented strpkey and strfkey with special flags for vim-specific formatting

[01:00:26] <LeoNerd> OK so.. Given the LHS of a :map, throw that string at termkey_strpkey with the right flags to recognise vim's specific input. It'll give you a size_t to tell you how many bytes of input encoded one keypress. While you have more, keep going. When you get to the end you'll have a squence of TermKeyKey structs from the entire LHS of the map
[01:02:16] <bfredl> we can probably do that but it won't be in the mapping layer, but a change to tui.c

[01:09:33] <bfredl> sure, that is a problem that needs to be fixed. internally in nvim.
[01:09:47] <bfredl> libtermkey only concerns the mapping with terminal imput in tui

[01:29:11] <LeoNerd> To the point that everyone has got so used to it they don't even think of those being different letters any more. They look at me confused, when I try to type Y and Z differently

[01:29:44] <LeoNerd> I say "hey, I can't map Ctrl-[ differently", and people go on about how that's really Esc and I have to repeatedly explain that, no, it isn't.
[01:30:19] <bfredl> well, the upside is we are a fork of vim trying to fix stuff. the downside is that Real Work still needs to fix each stuff that someone wants fixed.
[01:30:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think the focus at the time was "lol, terminal in your vim? not from us! gl with making that happen"
[01:30:50] <clason[m]> to be fair, that's not what I was saying
[01:31:03] <LeoNerd> It's a terrible analogy, but sometimes in projects [not just here, but in lots of places], I end up feeling like I've invented a lightswitch. As if everyone has lightbulbs and uses hot-work gloves to screw the bulbs into/out of the sockets, as a way to control them. I ask people why they don't just use a lightswitch - and they look at *me* confused, as if they'd never heard of one
[01:31:18] <bfredl> "it should have worked correctly 25 years ago!" sure we can dream, but what we do here is to incrementally improve on the codes that we actually have inherited
[01:31:27] <LeoNerd> I say "dudes, just use this lightswitch" and people treat it as a really weird suggestion
[01:32:07] <bfredl> and in nvim we have ext_lightswitch if your UI happens to support it :]
[01:37:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> aside from keycode technicalities, the fortnightly '0.4.4' mention happened
[01:38:15] <bfredl> which of them distros is shipping that
[01:38:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's always a surprise, when I think of the amount of features that version lacks

[01:39:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> *0.5
[01:39:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> that doesn't seem long enough to be mad that not _everywhere_ caught up
[01:40:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's more a) the amount of pending changes that 0.5 held
[01:40:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> and b) the rate of progress since

[01:42:44] <LeoNerd> Since vim knows about word and WORD, I decided what I really want is for Ctrl-Backspace to delete back a word, but Ctrl-Shift-Backspace to delete back a WORD
[01:43:22] <bfredl> hmm, somehow that never has been a problem for me. 
[01:43:34] <LeoNerd> Now, it turns out I don't believe it to be possible to :map to anything (on the RHS), that reliably and neatly will always delete from the start of the word/WORD up to the current cursor position, but no further, regardless of where the cursor is on the line, and whether there's any more text after it
[01:44:00] <bfredl> maybe because I am used to "terminal" and "fancy gui app" to be two completely different domains where everything is different
[01:44:02] <LeoNerd> Every possible attempt will sometimes either accidentally delete the next character to the right (after) of the cursor as well, or sometimes not delete enough
[01:44:45] <LeoNerd> This is also annoying because I want shift-backspace to delete a Cluster.. so without an ability to write such a general map, I can't do any of these :(
[01:45:17] <LeoNerd> Basically, the issue is: be able to create Ctrl-W-type actions on custom user-defined bounds
[01:45:46] <bfredl> my bet is some kind of <c-o> based mapping but I have never felt the need of anything like that
[01:48:08] <LeoNerd> Ohsure that's the way to get out of insert into normal mode. I can't even do it in normal mode
[01:48:38] <LeoNerd> The main trouble is that if the cursor is at the very end of the line, then it moves differently on the insert->normal switch, than if there was trailing text; which is why sometimes you delete a character too much or not enough
[01:49:01] <LeoNerd> Ultimately it highlights why I think the very concept of :map is wrong

[01:49:17] <LeoNerd> But that's a really basic "vim was always like that" design from 30 years ago so it's not nvim's fault
[01:51:31] <bfredl> hmm I don't get the concept of "one mapping is missing" to "the very concept of :map is wrong"
[01:52:07] <bfredl> you should be able to cover up for the missing mapping, but it will require an <expr> mapping with some code, it sounds like
[01:52:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://github.com/chaoren/vim-wordmotion does this sort of thing (probably doesn't solve your particular problem)
[01:52:56] <LeoNerd> Ahyes, a :map exrp might do it
[01:52:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> but once you're in normal, you can do the same kind of thing; lookahead for the end-of-line problem
[01:53:33] <LeoNerd> I think really more, my point becomes: I think everything should be a :map <expr>, that should be the only thing that -exists-
[01:54:08] <LeoNerd> Because every other program with "keybindings" treats them as bindings. When I press a key => do this actual thing. Whereas :map is a rewrite engine. When I press a key => pretend I instead pressed these other keys
[01:54:15] <LeoNerd> (and maybe those other keys will as a side-effect do a thing)

[21:00:43] <LeoNerd> I've always liked perl's `sub` for a good middle-ground of length
[21:01:11] <LeoNerd> sub($x) { $x + 1 }  isn't too long as to be annoying in small inline cases
[21:01:47] <ppeb[m]> I like c#'s where it's just the return type and the name. `void X` or `string Y` is goof on length
[21:01:51] <ppeb[m]> s/goof/good/
[21:03:20] <Amanda[m]> i like rust's very concise `|| { <function body here > }`
[21:03:22] <LeoNerd> It does make static parsing of C-like languages somewhat trickier though, because you need to keep track of all the identifier names that are types, that can therefore begin a function
[21:03:43] <LeoNerd> Whereas having a single fixed keyword for it makes.. I dunno... editor syntax highlight / folding / indenting rules simpler. ;)
[21:03:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can make it whatever you like, when https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15706 is born

[21:42:08] <mjlbach[m]> focus = false
[21:42:11] <mjlbach[m]> not focsusable
[21:42:16] <mjlbach[m]> they are two separate options
[21:44:10] <mjlbach[m]> why sad face
[21:44:23] <mjlbach[m]> focus means "enter the window" focusable means "you *can* enter the window"
[21:44:47] <ppeb[m]> yeah, setting focusable to false should stop it from entering

[21:47:06] <mjlbach[m]> Ah
[21:47:07] <ppeb[m]> * neutral face, wasn't trying to blame you or anything.
[21:47:10] <mjlbach[m]> you can file an issue about that
[21:47:44] <mjlbach[m]> I'm not sure if it should be a documentation change or a behavior change tbh, I remember gpanders separated out the two options right before 0.6 released
[21:48:14] <ppeb[m]> I feel like it should be a behavior change since other, similar things, work that way
[21:48:45] <ppeb[m]> * that way (sig help iirc)

[22:48:18] <luisiacc[m]> thank you, that works
[22:48:47] <luisiacc[m]> is there any commandish way to do it, like `:lua some.module.close_all_floating_windows()` ?
[22:52:04] <mjlbach[m]> if some.module implements the close_all_floating_windows, then yes
