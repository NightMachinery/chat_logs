[00:33:21] <Roey> though I take issue with the assertion that Jews like Chinese restaurants because there are no Christian symbols on the walls.
[00:33:36] <Roey> that's /never/ been an issue for me
[00:34:39] <Roey> actually, I take my words back because it's not what I meant to address: 
[00:35:15] <Roey> I find that assertion a minor one, certainly not something that I ever gave a thought to in my life time of going to Chinese restaurants as a Jew.

[06:02:05] <Fenderbassist> yeah if all you ever saw was a Beetle, you would think all cars had air cooled engines (no water pump or radiator) and generators (no alternator)
[06:02:18] <Fenderbassist> no oil filter, just an oil screen
[06:02:26] <Fenderbassist> no air filter, just oil air filter
[06:02:56] <Fenderbassist> no heater core, just heater boxes that surrounded exhaust pipe to relay heat
[06:03:34] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: except for the lack of AC I would still happyly drive a beetle today
[06:04:17] <Fenderbassist> would be fun to have one as a Sunday car here
[06:04:30] <Fenderbassist> but too hot for me to be without AC for part of the year :)

[06:11:44] <MootPoot> I wonder if head on or rear end collisions are more common
[06:11:46] <Fenderbassist> if you got hit hard from the rear, your head could snap back and hit the roof

[07:48:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: why do people say happy holidays
[07:49:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: cause there are many holidays going on at this time of year, some people find some greetings offensive
[07:49:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's also a lot easier and lazier to just say holidays than start enumerating.
[07:49:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I certainly wouldn't bother.
[07:49:54] <DunceCotus> if people get offended that's their problem
[07:50:18] <DunceCotus> I will continue to say Merry Christmas cause that's what I celebrate, people who celebrate other holidays can continue to say Happy X holiday

[10:30:12] <soun> why?

[10:30:18] <MootPoot> its officially day 2 of my holiday

[10:30:29] <Sadale> good luck MootPoot :3
[10:30:35] <soun> gl MootPoot 
[10:31:58] <MootPoot> I'm writing it on a mac :3
[10:32:04] <Sadale> evil mac :P
[10:32:05] <MootPoot> that's not FOSS
[10:32:07] <MootPoot> lol
[10:32:29] <MootPoot> Sadale: I do like that framework laptop but its really expensive
[10:32:31] <Sadale> screw you Apple! :P/
[10:32:34] <MootPoot> especially since I got this one for free ~
[10:32:36] <MootPoot> lol
[10:32:46] * Sadale meanwhile is holding NASDAQ100 ETF, which contains Apple stonks
[10:32:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, I agree that framework laptop's overpriced.
[10:33:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, would you consider building your own superlaptop tho? Just like how I did :P
[10:33:27] <MootPoot> eh, not really- my laptops are fine for what they are 
[10:33:28] <MootPoot> I have 4
[10:33:29] <Sadale> It doesn't have battery. But it's inexpensive :3
[10:33:39] <Sadale> And it's far more upgradable than conventional laptop
[10:33:43] <MootPoot> Sadale: at that point just make a mini ITX pc lol
[10:34:05] <Sadale> As long as you aren't moving the ITX PC, it's ok. But if you're moving it, you really want a laptop of some kind. :p
[10:34:42] <Sadale> If the ITX PC and the monitors are separated, you'd have two items to move and two items to setup. With this superlaptop, the monitor is attached directly onto the computer case :P
[10:34:45] <MootPoot> I do want a ITX PC, I have no idea my arch laptop will last
[10:34:57] <MootPoot> Sadale: true, but I already have my macbook air for ultraportability
[10:35:06] <Sadale> anwyay if you've got 4 laptops tho you probably don't want another laptop
[10:35:11] <Sadale> and yeah.
[10:35:24] <Sadale> you rich :P
[10:35:29] * Sadale poor :3
[10:35:46] <Sadale> Someone please donate to this cute poor Sadale :3
[10:37:59] <MootPoot> well, 2 are trash

[10:38:28] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: kinda want some keto ramen
[10:38:37] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[10:38:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you don't want that tho you may wish to send it to someone in Cuba. US is rather close to Cuba physically.
[10:38:41] <ButterNoodle> I'm off the wagon
[10:38:44] <ButterNoodle> so real ramen
[10:38:45] <MootPoot> I hear there is some company making instant noodles out of pumpkin something
[10:38:53] <MootPoot> Sadale: dont want what
[10:38:53] <Sadale> The people there are true poor. And some of them need a laptop rather badly
[10:38:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, laptop
[10:39:05] <MootPoot> well - it'll cost me more to send it then what ti's worth

[11:07:37] <MootPoot> lol
[11:08:26] <Sadale> Now that those anti-government people are out of the council of HK. Let's hope that the government actually do something to make the landprice to drop so that the housing would be affordable here.
[11:08:35] <MootPoot> lol

[11:08:43] <MootPoot> just move to canada

[11:08:55] <Sadale> It is actually in its agenda to make housing affordable. But I'm not sure how long it'd take to become a thing.
[11:08:59] <Sadale> lol
[11:08:59] <MootPoot> Sadale: lets just both move to vietnam

[11:09:07] <MootPoot> why PH
[11:09:13] <MootPoot> do you want to spend time with the ladyboys?
[11:09:15] <Sadale> PH is easier. It has retirement visa.
[11:09:23] <Sadale> And they speak English
[11:10:22] <PancakeMatsuri> monopoly breeds inability
[11:10:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, are you willing to learn Vietnamese for saving housing cost tho? :P
[11:10:40] <Sadale> I don't think you are. :P
[11:10:58] <Sadale> or you could live in those expat area. But those are more expensive than local neighborhoods.
[11:11:17] <MootPoot> vietnamese?

[16:12:00] <JesseDesu2> i dont see how thats different than america
[16:12:16] <JesseDesu2> we just put more emphasis on christmas
[16:12:25] <amigojapan> I see
[16:13:08] <JesseDesu2> we send cards in red envelopes
[16:13:29] <amigojapan> Jesse the one I am sending includes a lottery to win some money
[16:13:34] <JesseDesu2> well, 85% are red, 7-8% green
[16:14:11] <JesseDesu2> ahh
[16:14:23] <JesseDesu2> thats like buying someone a lotto ticket
[16:14:42] <amigojapan> Yep, but for less money
[16:14:52] <JesseDesu2> you gotta get 6 numbers right ranged from 1-52 i think
[16:15:07] <JesseDesu2> its called the mega millions jackpot
[16:15:18] <amigojapan> The number is included in the card, I did not pick it
[16:15:32] <JesseDesu2> ah
[16:15:45] <JesseDesu2> then its like fortune cookies with lotto picks in the back
[16:15:53] <JesseDesu2> some of them have that
[16:15:57] <amigojapan> I think this lottery has more possibilities of winning a small amount of money
[16:16:31] <JesseDesu2> lottery is just the redistribution of wealth
[16:16:35] <JesseDesu2> minus some taxes
[16:16:58] <JesseDesu2> leech off the hopes and dreams of millions of poor people
[16:17:09] <JesseDesu2> to make one or two millionaires
[16:17:26] <amigojapan> Jesse more like sending someone a scratch it
[16:17:46] <JesseDesu2> lol i hate the people who hold up the liquor store line
[16:17:51] <JesseDesu2> to buy more scratch its
[16:18:19] <JesseDesu2> they play it right there and want instant winnings for more gambling
[16:18:42] <amigojapan> Jesse this is only a lottery for winning 100usd

[16:19:58] <JesseDesu2> i edited a photo of myself for an hour

[16:20:12] <amigojapan> Sure

[16:20:19] <amigojapan> Ok
[16:21:09] <amigojapan> I don't see a pm yet Jesse
[16:21:13] <JesseDesu2> there we go
[16:21:15] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[16:21:44] <JesseDesu2> i read how most cameras in phones these days take pictures better than dslr or mirrorless big cameras
[16:22:10] <JesseDesu2> thats because most people arent going to edit them in desktop applications similar to lightroom
[16:22:21] <JesseDesu2> which takes only a couple clicks in most cases to get the same result

[16:23:52] <JesseDesu2> rawtherapee
[16:24:06] <amigojapan> Wow what a name
[16:24:30] <JesseDesu2> raw is a type of image file that is mostly raw sensor data
[16:24:47] <JesseDesu2> most advanced cameras simultaneously save raw and jpeg
[16:25:44] <amigojapan> Sounds like rape tho
[16:26:08] <JesseDesu2> like, if you do an exposure compensation to make it brighter or darker, editing the raw file saves more detail
[16:26:33] <JesseDesu2> but only a little bit, most people wouldnt know and most people still edit jpegs
[16:26:45] <amigojapan> I see
