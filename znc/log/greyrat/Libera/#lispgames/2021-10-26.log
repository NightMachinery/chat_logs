[00:45:17] <dto> wow. i have the enemies only consider moving on the detected kicks, and only consider shooting on the detected snares, and it WORKS
[00:45:29] <dto> video soon!
[00:45:53] <technomancy> this is something you have been working on since before the jam right?
[00:46:57] <dto> of course yes.
[00:47:17] <technomancy> ah gotcha; I was hoping to see it in the jam submissions but I guess this is a different thing
[00:47:22] <dto> the whole scheme stuff i did in 2020 and 2021
[00:47:31] <dto> yeah it's way too unfinished to submit anything for this jam
[00:48:18] <dto> i trained some simple neural networks in scheme to classify samples as probability of containing a kick, snare, or cymbal/hihat
[01:24:00] <dto> technomancy: i have a 2nd one coming but this one is nice, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d1F4sGMayA
[01:24:37] <technomancy> haha nice!
[01:29:42] <dto> thanks! a lot of work remains. 
[01:31:47] <dto> technomancy: this one shows the kick/snare a bit better, although i should increase the firing rate...
[01:31:47] <dto> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwutWx-chRA
[01:32:28] <dto> so this'll be that easy first level with slow tempo
[01:33:16] <dto> but the dance pad needs to go beyond just directional control on the beat.... i need to move the character to the center of the screen and scroll around him instead, keeping enemies balanced around you so that your steps are balanced on the directions

[02:52:14] <peterhil> dto: The beat-by-beat DSP analysis is way cool! I have tried to do an audio application for ten years, and I’d like to take a look of SchemeMosaic. Is it open source?
[02:52:49] <dto> yep. https://gitlab.com/dto/mosaic-el/-/blob/master/scheme-mosaic.org
[02:53:04] <dto> it is built on top of the free software Snd environment from Stanford
[02:53:16] <dto> unfortunately the sound sample links are broken
[02:53:32] <dto> how are you peterhil ? i'm looking forward to trying out your jam entry soon!
[02:54:50] <dto> what sort of audio application are you tinking of ? 
[02:54:55] <dto> thinking*
[02:57:57] <peterhil> dto: I’m fine thanks – and now got some good rest finally also! (I did not sleep last night, but just slept 8 hours.
[02:59:40] <peterhil> Oh, I have been actually inspired by Julius O. Smith’s writings on DSP – he is a professor on Stanford’s CCRMA, which has made Snd. I really need to take a look. 
[03:03:04] <peterhil> I wanted to make a kind of "Photoshop for sound", after reading three books about audio synthesis methods, Data compression (by Gilbert Held), and fundamentals of interactive computer graphics in 1997. I had also read about wavelets and how autotune work by modifying the data on the frequency plane. I use complex numbers in my applicatino for all DSP.
[03:03:47] <peterhil> But it is written in Python/Numpy, so for real time playing, I need to port at least parts of it to some compiled language without gc.
[03:05:12] <peterhil> And I have had some weird issue (Python segfaulting) on the last versions of Pygame, which I have not been able to solve. I’d like to move the animation code to some QT binginds or WX.
[03:06:29] <peterhil> dto: I am also a drummer, so this beat detection highly interests me!
[03:09:10] <peterhil> technomancy: Maybe I should play a ‘lamenting’ sound and flash the disappearing levels in the next version?
[03:09:54] <peterhil> I mean in Alchemy to make it clear that it is the way the game is meant to work.
[03:10:01] <technomancy> peterhil: well, I mean yes, but it wasn't so much that they didn't notice when it happened; it was more that they didn't understand why
[03:10:19] <technomancy> if you can visually indicate the imbalance somehow, that would help
[03:10:25] <technomancy> like ... what could you do differently to avoid this
[03:11:40] <peterhil> Yeah, I have been thinking about that also. Its could be shown on the left side in some way. And maybe also hightlight the counts on the right that are close or equal to the neext one
[03:12:20] <technomancy> good call
[03:47:17] <dto> peterhil: glad you got some rest. Cool I'm interested to hear more about your audio application, maybe we can pick each other's brains

[04:09:58] <peterhil> dto: Gladly! Should we find a more suitable channel?
[04:10:20] <peterhil> technomancy: Updated guidem that is hopefully a little bit more clear: https://github.com/peterhil/alchemy#alchemy
[04:12:47] <dto> peterhil: sure we could use either my channel or direct message, however I'm about to pass out in bed I think :-) so I will ping you tomorrow
[04:13:26] <peterhil> dto: Maybe your channel then. Ok, good night!
[05:31:30] <peterhil> dto: What is the difference between the two repos for mosaic and mosaic-el?
[05:56:01] <technomancy> peterhil: cool
[05:56:07] <technomancy> man, glibc my old nemesis
[05:56:24] <peterhil> :-)
[05:56:32] <technomancy> I just want to play some games, don't yell at me glibc!
[05:57:40] <peterhil> I could not get any of the Mac games to work yet, because they were all compiled for Catalina 10.15 SDK, and I still use 10.14 Mojave and 10.12 High Sierra.
[05:58:55] <peterhil> And I use 32-bit Arch Linux (had to say it...) – so I wonder that maybe I can just try the games by building from sources on Mac.
[05:59:47] <peterhil> On the other hand – I have Ubuntu installation on the other partition. Have somebody else tried to compile the games from sources and succeeded?
[06:00:43] <peterhil> I should have about working Common Lisp installatoins at least.

[19:50:00] <dthompson> for those that find my game too hard but are interested in seeing the whole level: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8t2tdZ3hRI

[19:57:24] <dthompson> pjb: ?
[19:58:02] <pjb> I've seen the same game in the 70s…
[19:58:14] <pjb> Only it was space aliens, instead of bees.
[19:58:27] <dthompson> it's in the shooter genre, yes.
[20:00:12] <dthompson> it's a little bit of ikaruga and a little bit of touhou mixed together.  my humble take on a classic arcade genre.
[20:18:34] <dto> dthompson: awesome, will watch shortly!
[20:22:07] <dthompson> :)
[20:24:15] <peterhil> dthompson: Your game seems fun – although a little aggressive for a bees and flowers game! :-D
[20:24:32] <dthompson> peterhil: the absurdity is all part of it :)
[20:24:58] <peterhil> Yeah, I like the absurdity.
[20:26:11] <technomancy> you're an AMERICAN bee =D
[20:26:27] <dthompson> ;)
[20:26:44] <dto> dthompson: just finished watching. I love it and absolutely awesome work with all the different bullet spray patterns especially the butterflies that spray downward I thought that was really cool.
[20:26:45] <dthompson> I had to rationalize "why can a bee shoot things?" to myself
[20:26:56] <dthompson> dto: thanks!
[20:27:02] <dto> It reminds me of a turbo graphics 16 game called cybercore
[20:27:27] <dthompson> there are so many shmup games in existence it seems to remind everyone of something different
[20:28:04] <dthompson> someone showed me an amiga game that was a horizontal scrolling shmup where the player is a bee
[20:29:56] <dto> oh cool
[20:29:57] <dto> :)
[20:39:03] <peterhil> dthompson: I think I have played that Amiga game. Can not recall the name right now.
[20:58:42] <dthompson> peterhil: apidya

[21:47:37] <peterhil> The Apidya game was so hard though, that I never saw it past the first few initial screens.
