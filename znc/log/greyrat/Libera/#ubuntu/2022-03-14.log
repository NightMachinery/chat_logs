[06:56:24] <jhutchins> semitones: Older systems assigned each user to a collective group (like "users").
[06:56:35] <semitones> I have read some things, but I can't keep it organized in my brain. Awhile back I thought that if you were creating a new user with adduser, you'd have to do it like "adduser semitones:" in order to also create the group as well
[06:56:48] <semitones> but most of the tutorials just say to create the user like "adduser semitones"
[06:56:52] <semitones> without the semicolon
[06:56:58] <Ravage> my guess is to keep your files in the home directory safe even if applications give permissions to the group. but as jhutchins says the general users group is not used anymore really

[21:45:31] <BlackArch2> im gonna try editing the sources.list file
[21:46:14] <programmerq> say I install version 4.2.1 of some package. I'd like to prevent automatic upgrades to a 4.3.y or a 5.x.y version, but I'd like to also allow automatic updates to upgrade if a 4.2.2 or any other 4.2.y version comes out. 'apt-mark hold' holds the package as it is and doesn't allow any upgrades. Is there a way to achieve this?
[21:47:20] <sarnold> programmerq: you're probably solving a problem that doesn't exist https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/FAQ#Versions https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Why
[21:49:02] <programmerq> it's to deal with third party software release cycle not necessarily following best practices, or needing to hold back major.minor updates until a component external to the system is upgraded.
[21:49:04] <ogra> BlackArch2, can you please leave out the swear words when chatting here (you have been told about it this morning already) ... that cant be that hard given that everyone else manages it (no offense etc ...) 🙂
[21:49:16] <leftyfb> BlackArch2: what exactly are you editing into your sources.list?
[21:49:39] <programmerq> I figured apt doesn't have a way to do this since it is kind of dealing with a not-typical situation, but figured I'd ask in case I missed something.
