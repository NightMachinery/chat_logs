[00:07:53] <Z-module> hmm, thinking about Hagfish's question before. If p(x) in Z[x] is nonconstant with constant term 1 or -1, must there be distinct positive integers m, n with p(m), p(n) not coprime?  It's trivially yes if the constant term d has |d| > 1.

[06:14:38] <JacKeown> I'm convinced of it now, but don't know how to prove it lol
[06:15:18] <Fangs> JacKeown: well now T^2 - T = 0, so T(T-1) = 0
[06:15:27] <Fangs> JacKeown: what's the kernel? what's the image?
[06:15:42] <Fangs> err
[06:16:35] <Fangs> JacKeown: take v in V, and note that T(T - 1)v = 0, so v is in ker T-1 or v is in ker T
[06:16:52] <Fangs> if v is in ker T-1, then T(v) - 1v = 0, so T(v) = v
[06:17:39] <Fangs> I think I shouldve said (T-1)v is in Ker T, instead of just 'v'
[06:20:31] <cherim> Normally it's done as: I=T +(I-T) so any v=Tv + (I-T)v where first is in image, second in kernel. If also v=w+u with v in image, u in kernel, then you can restore w, u uniquely by acting with T or I-T, Tv=Tw=w, (I-T)v=(I-T)u=u
[06:20:54] <JacKeown> Hmm I think I get it

[06:55:35] <Capso> I originally thought so
[06:55:42] <PlanckWalk> Because P(X_i = x) is zero for all nonzero x.

[07:41:55] <Capso> yeah, I think that's the right way to look at that
[07:42:22] <Capso> this keeps N fixed and it's what the expectation of X_j means (morally, anyways)
[07:42:33] <PlanckWalk> Then yes, you do get identical distributions for the X's.

[13:03:04] <nagefire> I'm unfamiliar with tensors, so I have no clue about the second half
[13:03:43] <cherim> A rank 1 operator is always of form u v^T for vectors u, v
[13:04:04] <rubiksdream> whats an operator?
[13:04:21] <cherim> Linear map here
[13:04:24] <rubiksdream> it is a linear functional
[13:04:29] <rubiksdream> oh linear map
[13:04:52] <nagefire> Yes, I call that the rank decomposition
[13:05:11] <cherim> So if you have a natural concept of a typical vector u, v, you have a typical rank-1 operator
[13:05:35] <rubiksdream> and 'add rank 1 operator' means like sum of two linear maps?
[13:05:41] <cherim> "What happens everywhere except measure 0" is an equivalent question, but not entirely algebraic
[13:06:00] <cherim> Yes, a perturbation means A->A+B with rank B=1
[13:06:20] <rubiksdream> but then why is the eigenvalue preserved?
[13:06:37] <cherim> This is why geometry is useful :)
[13:07:11] <nagefire> so, the change in blocks is looking at the possible changes in rank(A + uv^* - cI), rank((A + uv^* - cI)^2), ... all the way up to the index of the eigenvalue
[13:07:36] <nagefire> this is based on what I know from Horn's text
[13:08:30] <rubiksdream> now i feel a bit dumb, ive done jcfs in linear algebra courses, am admittedly rusty with them but it feels like i should at least know why adding a rank 1 matrix preserves eigenvalues
[13:08:56] <nagefire> geometrically, what's happening? We're adjusting the basis of the degenrate eigenspace?
[13:10:05] <rubiksdream> as long as the eigenvalue if preserved for sure that is happening, but i do not see how that is geometric
[13:10:08] <rubiksdream> *is
[13:10:47] <cherim> (Without loss of generality your degenerate eigenvalue was 0; many jordan blocks meant your operator had big deficiency in rank; adding a low-rank operator increases rank by at most 1, so a big deficiency remains; there will still be many blocks corresponding to that exact 0)
[13:12:02] <nagefire> rubiksdream pretty sure a rank-1 perturbation preserve eigenvalues? I_n + 11^* has spectrum {1, 1, 1, ..., n+1}
[13:12:47] <cherim> It doesn't preseve all, of course. It may even add an extra dimension to your lambda
[13:13:14] <rubiksdream> what is 11^*?
[13:13:19] <cherim> If everything was non-degenerate (not our case), then typically no eigenvalue is preserved
[13:13:55] <nagefire> the n by n all-ones matrix; the outer product of the all-ones vector in R^n
[13:14:16] <cherim> The question is how the n1>=n2>=... sequence transforms 1) typically; 2) next-to-typically; 3)  without considering codimension, what is full list of possible changes
[13:14:51] <cherim> Preferrably a proof without writing down a single formula, but you are free to do as you please
[13:16:39] <cherim> I remember the proof of Jacobi-Chasles theorem in appendix of Arnold's "Mathematical methods..."

[13:19:14] <rubiksdream> stupid question, why does adding a low-rank operator increase rank by at most 1? I am imagining this low rank operator is already in JCF in which case I can see why

[15:06:42] <Fangs> commutator is zero just means they commute. if v is an eigenvector of A, then Av = cv, now note that ABv = ... = c*Bv, so Bv is an eigenvector of A, infact every B^kv is, if the vector space is finite dimensional, \there is some n such that sum_{k=1 to n} ak B^kv is linearly dependent but if we stop at n-1 it is not linearly dependent, and note that we start from k = 1, so B(sum ak B^{k-1})v = 0... so I think (sum ak B^{k-1})v is a

[15:11:34] <DPA> I've been wondering, in math, it can very quickly become very difficult to impossible to solve a system of equations for certain constraints, and there are one-way functions which can not be reversed trivially.
[15:11:34] <DPA> I have been wondering, is this something fundamental, or is that a limitation of the logic systems used in math?
[15:11:34] <DPA> Are there any useful logic systems, which are designed to be always trivially solvable for any representable constraint, where every function is reversable, and where no one-way functions exist?
[15:11:34] <DPA> I would be mostly interested in logic systems for integer arithmetic only, which are designed to be used by computers. Something where I can specify suff like a=b+2, a*2=b, and I can know that a pc can always solve it quickly and give me any possible values for a and b (-2,-4).
[15:13:16] <DPA> Like, I can define a logic system in which only addition and substraction exist, so any formula in it would be trivial and quick to solve. I wonder, how far can that be taken?

[19:22:46] <Z-module> yes, the size of an orbit is easy, but they might want to you find the actual orbit itself:  |O(x)| vs. O(x)
[19:22:48] <cadmio> yes 'cause I've to find how many distinct words with two As, three Bs and on two Cs are possible
[19:23:02] <Z-module> okay
[19:23:42] *** Joins: gggp (~gggp@60.10.194.46)
[19:23:49] <cadmio> so 2!3!2! is the cardinality of the St_x
[19:23:53] <Z-module> so you look at the positions of symbols in AABBBCC , particularly for symbols that are the same letter, and find all possible ways to permute those symbols but sending each symbol X to a position where that *same* X already is.

[19:28:47] <cadmio> where ' means ^{-1}
[19:28:58] <Z-module> I find it more comprehensible with a generic notation. Let H be any subgroup (whatsoever) of G.  Then for any y and z in G (these are your g_1 and g_2),   Hx' = Hy'  iff   H = H(y'x)  iff   y'x \in H
[19:29:08] <Z-module> oops, I meant z in those, not x
[19:29:54] <Z-module>    Hy' = Hz'   iff   H = H(z'y'') = Hz'y    iff   z'y \in H
[19:30:27] <Z-module> more generally  Hw = (some set)   iff   H = (that set)w'
[19:30:33] <Z-module> just right-multiply both sets by w'
[19:30:55] <cadmio> if you look at the def of right coset: a ~ b <-> ab' in H
[19:31:03] <Z-module> if your original w is some y', then (y')' = y   so     Hy' = (some set)    iff     H = (that set)y
[19:31:23] <cadmio> here we have g_2'g_1 ∈ St_x so g_2' ~ g_1'

[19:54:04] <cgadski> like, if I'm looking at a path v_t in a separable Hilbert space, then I can use that result for real functions to prove that lambda(v_t) is almost everywhere differentiable for every lambda, which means that v_t is differentiable almost everywhere in the weak topology

[22:37:10] <loopspace> I just worked on a problem where my solution was 1+t²+t³+t⁵+t⁶+2t⁸+t⁹+t¹⁰+2t¹¹+t¹³+t¹⁴+t¹⁶+t¹⁷+t¹⁹. To simplify, all that occurred to me was to try -1 and i as roots. The latter worked, to yield: (1+t²)(1+t³+t⁶+t⁸+t⁹+t¹¹+t¹⁴+t¹⁷). After staring at it for a little while, it became apparent that the latter term was divisible by (1+t⁸), and the process stopped there...

[23:16:18] <loopspace> When I look at again now, I notice the pattern that many terms come in pairs whose degrees differ by 2. In fact all of them do, if one is careful with the terms with coefficient 2. From that I could have pulled out the (1+t^2) without finding a root. Then again for 1+t^8. Maybe that is sufficiently "pleasing"
