[01:54:39] <CoLo65> anybody know how resource intensive TheLounge would be for supporting a few hundred concurrent users?

[01:56:57] <CoLo65> Thinking of cloud hosting behind docker/traefik as a public instance and curious how much SSD/RAM to allocate if it works and becomes more than a personal project
[01:58:30] <Activ8> depends how many channels per user
[01:58:57] <Activ8> I'm sure I saw a post on github about lots of users and they where testing something
[01:59:40] <xnaas> The biggest impact on RAM, anyway, would be the maxHistory setting.
[01:59:54] <xnaas> I've never really seen much CPU usage from thelounge, though I have a fairly modern i5.
[02:00:55] <Activ8> probably also network related as well if there's many users, not monitored throughput e.t.c or anything for that matter
[02:02:10] <Activ8> I'm not sure how noisy/active the connection it would be with few hundred users without testing
[02:03:03] *** Quits: thelounge77 (~thelounge@90.199.35.75) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:06:11] <CoLo65> I'm thinking RAM would be my issue. My single user, 3-5 channel test instance doesn't even register on  usage on my docker sandbox machine even with VERY active channels at times
[02:06:12] <xnaas> I'm using like 300MB of RAM, but that's because I'm sure my maxHistory buffer is quite full :P
[02:06:12] <xnaas> If you don't mind the client having to query the sqlite database to scroll super far back, you can lower the maxHistory pretty substantially from the default of 10k
[02:06:12] <Activ8> unless you turned off maxhistory + logs
[02:06:12] *** Joins: thelounge778 (~thelounge@90.199.35.75)
[02:06:50] <xnaas> But if you're doing public public, you don't need to worry about logs (storage space, SSD/HDD) anyway.
[02:07:07] <xnaas> Since there's no user accounts to write logs for
[02:07:21] <xnaas> Then you would have to rely exclusively on maxHistory for scrollback
[02:07:57] <xnaas> I don't remember if it's MaxLeiter or bookworm or someone else who runs the public TL instance, but they might be able to provide some stats.

[02:12:35] <xnaas> o7
[02:13:27] <CoLo65> I have no problem dropping the maxHistory down to 1-2k or less... I will probably spin it up and get a few dozen to alpha test it and see if 2M+2M SWAP will work. That's what I'm hoping to get away with and stay in "budget"
[02:14:33] <xnaas> 4M of RAM tops? oof...you're gonna need like no history and no channels 😂
[02:15:01] <CoLo65> 😂 haha. I was afraid of that!
[02:15:22] <Activ8> sounds like you might need a beefy server
[02:17:48] <CoLo65> sorry... I meant 2G+2G Swap... 4G total. 
[02:17:56] <bookworm> look at the open issues, the R people didn't manage to run it for 200 users iirc
[02:18:19] <bookworm> TL doesn't exactly scale very well
[02:18:24] <Activ8> well
[02:18:28] <Activ8> maybe what you could do
[02:18:40] <Activ8> is split users over a couple of servers
[02:19:02] <Activ8> don't connect em to same one, do 200 over two to four servers
[02:19:30] <Activ8> 4x HTTPs URLs 50x users per server
[02:21:59] <emphatic> TheLounge is akin to multi-tenant SaaS in that users connecting to the same TheLounge instance don't have any connection to each other and don't share anything beyond system resources. They do share the same configuration (available themes, and system-wide config), however. That said, it's kind of interesting to think about what a SaaS version of
[02:21:59] <emphatic> TheLounge would be
[02:22:09] <MaxLeiter> It’s worth noting the R conf was private mode 
[02:22:37] <emphatic> I like TheLounge a lot, and it's cool to host it and play around with it, but I'd also gladly pay a monthly fee for a hosted version so I didn't have to 
[02:22:56] <MaxLeiter> then I would look at irccloud 
[02:23:20] <MaxLeiter> Afaik no one is hosting TL for others for profit atm, IPs can become a problem 
[02:23:57] <CoLo65> My use case is not critical and would be public only. I don't care about logs or history TBH... I guess the only way to find out is to try :-) 
[02:24:38] <Activ8> alternative is you bang it in public mode n keep upping the users and watching the usage
[02:26:11] <Activ8> I'm surprised TLC hasn't got a hosted solution tbf but along with that comes a whole load of other possible problems

[14:57:43] <petteri> has anybody made a css tweak or something similar to show realname instead of nick on the ui. There is quite wide support for https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/setname.html which lets you change the realname, so it would be nice to show that instead of nick
[15:00:57] *** Quits: diamondbond (~diamondbo@175.157.75.35) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[15:06:29] <bookworm> that'd be very confusing as things like tab completion, commands or highlights just work on the nick, not sure how useful that really is
[15:10:36] <petteri> i kind of like it, at least with ircloud and slack it works fine
[15:10:43] <petteri> irccloud
[15:11:25] <bookworm> how do they handle the above problem?
[15:11:48] <bookworm> irc cloud that is, don't care about slack
[15:13:24] <bookworm> keep in mind a large portion of the irc users either puts garbage in the realname field or some clients (including TL) use it to shove an advert in
[15:13:26] <petteri> they both work in the same way (i would assume that most of these new chatsystems are similar). They have the realname and nick there
[15:13:39] *** Quits: Hax0r (~Hax0r@51.252.26.81) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:14:07] <bookworm> ehw, that would use up a fair amount of space and you essentially need the two line per message layout
[15:14:31] <bookworm> which makes the message density very low per screen
[15:15:14] <fnutt> No thanks! We use nicknames on IRC for our names we want to use.
[15:15:39] <fnutt> Realname is just garbage field... that really none cares about, in my opinion.
[15:16:10] <petteri> ha, i care
[15:16:20] <petteri> and my friends x)
[15:16:21] <bookworm> I mean adding the data would probably be fine, as long as it can be disabled
[15:16:53] <fnutt> Why DOn't you use Sarah as nickname instead then?
[15:16:58] <fnutt> don't
[15:17:32] <fnutt> I mean... you have Sarah as realname. Why not use it as nickname instead?
[15:17:36] <bookworm> because you can't shove non ascii things in a nock fnutt and not everyone is American
[15:17:41] <fnutt> (if it's realname you want to show)
[15:19:48] <petteri> it is also easier to change the realname than nick (from point of view of the system)
[15:19:50] <bookworm> not really no
[15:20:00] <bookworm> changing a nick is a single command
[15:20:13] <fnutt> ./nick <new nick>
[15:20:17] <fnutt> Is this difficult?
[15:20:17] <petteri> with the services i mean
[15:20:22] <bookworm> it has to be free and some severe limitations on length and chars, that's true
[15:20:30] <bookworm> no?

[15:20:44] <petteri> at least on ergo you cannot change nick at all
[15:20:44] <bookworm> your nick doesn't have a link to your account per se
[15:20:54] <bookworm> yes, because they only use an account
[15:21:33] <bookworm> that's a quirk of them though, ergo isn't exactly a normal irc net
[15:22:02] <fnutt> https://github.com/ergochat/ergo you mean?
[15:22:19] <petteri> yes, but just saying that there are usecases
[15:22:54] <petteri> and I think the non-ascii etc. are also nice to have
[15:24:27] <bookworm> sure, but it would involve substantial structure changes layout wise and I don't think just using CSS will get there
[15:25:24] <bookworm> that sounds more like changes as in patching the actual vue files, make it two lines per message, and making nick mentions in a message a matrix style bubble
[15:25:25] <venussa> (and freenode too disallowed /nick)
[15:25:40] <bookworm> who the heck cares about freenode...
[15:25:44] <archpc> Wtf why
[15:25:51] <bookworm> their dead, stop beating a dead horse
[15:25:59] <bookworm> they're*
[15:26:03] <venussa> ha ha
[15:28:10] <petteri> ok, but no css tweaks yet. I remember seeing some bug report on github with an layout example couple of years a go, but could not find it now
[15:28:11] <fnutt> "Current global users: 1903 Max: 1914"
[15:28:19] <fnutt> This is the stats for Freenode right now.
[15:28:21] <bookworm> but to get what petteri wants you'd need to make changes which are directly antagonizing the very reason some use IRC..  namely the high message density without all the visual emoji display name nonsense and profile bubbles. Least it needs two separate code templates
[15:28:30] <fnutt> 1900 users..... LOL!
[15:28:31] <archpc> fnutt, hahahaha
[15:28:49] <archpc> my vps gets that many login attempts per day, sad
[15:28:55] <bookworm> which is again a maintenance burden 🤷‍♂️
