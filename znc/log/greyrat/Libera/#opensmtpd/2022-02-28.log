[18:05:23] <fgm> ehlo! I'm using OpenSMTPD as explained in poolp.org and it works great. I backup my Maildir via crontab/ssh/rsync, is there a better way to do that?
[19:41:13] <leah2> there are imap-based backup tools, but i'd use rsync as well :p

[22:45:57] <fgm> oh! I forgot to add rsync, thank you
[22:46:25] <fgm> I have rsync -czrpgovD --delete-after --rsh="ssh" mail-user@10.10.10.1:~/Maildir /home/foo/backup
[22:46:55] <fgm> every minute... anyway, I was looking for something like deliver to two places at the same time
[22:47:18] <fgm> to avoid a single point of failure during that minute
