[00:31:07] <artao> :O
[00:31:11] <DOMF> albiet a version with an actual terminal
[00:31:12] <artao> you're old :P
[00:31:18] <DOMF> I'm kind of old
[00:31:25] <artao> me too. but not that old
[00:31:30] <DOMF> I was like 3 and my parents business was building/selling them from kits
[00:31:36] <artao> ohhhhh
[00:31:41] <artao> o.O
[00:31:45] <DOMF> but I learned to read so I could use it

[00:31:49] <DOMF> yeah!
[00:31:49] <sublim20> dont forget the weed
[00:31:57] <artao> they did that?
[00:31:57] <DOMF> there was this company called Heathkit
[00:32:01] <artao> i mean DEC
[00:32:01] <DOMF> that sold kits
[00:32:12] <artao> i'd think they'd want to build them all themselves to avoid issues

[00:36:02] <DOMF> yep that's the one!
[00:36:11] <TomatoSynth> artao do they have drm? or any ilok type thing? or is it just a straight installation

[00:37:37] <DOMF> I've been reading him the books and he's been loving them
[00:37:39] <artao> not a spoiler. the game gives you ZERO reason to do it
[00:37:50] <DOMF> I don't even remember the dog
[00:38:02] <artao> widely considered one of the most egregiously unfair things in gaming history lol

[19:26:05] <The_Blode_> Well that's good. In my book, that's somewhat social if you are social with them that is.

[19:28:38] <The_Blode_> I always get the lines blurred between real life and online life...they sometimes merge into one these days.
[19:28:49] <louipc> meeting in real life is essential for real friendship imo
[19:29:44] <louipc> there are people who i have respect that i used to meet in real life but lost touch for whatever reason. those are 'old friends' not current friends tho
[19:32:35] <FreeRangeDillo> I have friends on IRC that I've known for a decade or more that I consider to be 'good internet friends', as we know each other well even though we haven't met
