[00:05:45] <POGtastic> Hi, got a silly question about system users and login commands. Say that I have a server, and I have a serial device connected to it on /dev/ttyS0. I want to be able to connect to `device` by creating a user `device` on the server, and setting that user's login shell to running picocom. That way, `ssh device@server` opens up a shell on the device. Is this reasonable?

[00:10:23] <grazzolini> POGtastic: this is borderline xy problem. but, afaik, ssh can't interact with TTY devices, only PTS ones.

[10:08:37] <randomusr> Hey all, I have this issue with my grub and boot process. I can login without issues now. However, when the boot loader attempts to reload root and the Kernel FS it fails. Guessing due to how Grub is configured. I have /boot on partition 1, along with this being the ESP folder and /root in partition 2. Looks like after initrd and initramfs hand the filesystem over to the kernel it tries to

[12:13:43] <h4rd3n3D> demon:  I only use btrfs for my LUKS2 /, which also contains my encrypted /boot folder
[12:15:32] <Berzerkula> so to boot you have to unencrypt /
[12:17:05] <th0rne> If you have encrypted /boot, then to boot you need to first decrypt /boot.
[12:17:25] <Berzerkula> well their boot is in / so they have to unencrpt / then get to boot then unencrypt that
[12:17:27] <h4rd3n3D> grub handles the initial stages of /boot unlocking, then initramfs kicks into high gear
[12:17:44] <th0rne> Even if you don't have an encrypted /boot, you will still need decrypt root if you have an encrypted drive.

[13:07:19] <raster> it's perfectly possible you hit a bug. it only happens to be triggered with the exact right sequence of logic and that file HAPPENS to trigger that logic.

[13:08:00] <Berzerkula> haha
[13:08:16] <raster> i see these things often enough. it's often the reason some dev goes "works for me" and some user goes "it crashes for me" and the stalemate continues because the dev can't find the logic path that triggers the bug as it does not happen to them.

[13:12:30] <aphirst> it doesn't exit, it looks fine on systemctl status and journalctl, but the transmission-daemon instance is uncontactable
[13:12:55] <raster> aphirst: if its crashing you want at least a backtrace to the crash point. possibly you want to use a full debug build with symbols and asan or valgrind to find the real origin of the bug if its a memory related one.
[13:12:59] <aphirst> if you remove the specific .torrent file from the profile /torrents folder and the .resume file from the /resume folder and restart the service, it comes back to life

[13:15:18] <aphirst> yeah i will try that
[13:15:20] <raster> it'd maybe give an indication if it's a deadlock or a blocking read() on data that never arrives ... etc.
[13:15:55] <aphirst> my blind speculation is that there is soemthing specific in the archlinux july .torrent, some metadata, that transmission really doesn't like, and that's screwing up the rpc interface
[13:15:59] <raster> just remember to get a bt of all threads ... but to truly understand it may then require knowledge of the code. but you may have something to share with the devs.
[13:16:11] <Berzerkula> other torrents work fine?
[13:16:34] <aphirst> Berzerkula, this is the only torrent it's ever happened to, and it onlt affected it when added as a .torrent, no issue if i just put the magnet in and get the metadata from peers
[13:17:09] <aphirst> so it's "clearly" not an issue with the *actual* metadata or data
[13:17:21] <Berzerkula> ok

[15:12:30] <GuiToris> (I'm talking about pacman)
[15:12:42] <NetSysFire> because pacman is not an aur helper
[15:12:49] <NetSysFire> pacman doesnt know how to search the aur

[15:13:02] <grawity> nobody asked about aur though

[15:24:40] <Zambezi> I have a couple of units (from Garmin) and memorycards (< 32 GB) using FAT32 which I no longer able to mount. Have something changed in the kernel last months or so? This is a major problem for me. 
[15:24:59] <NetSysFire> baltazar: you can instruct cloudflares 1.1.1.1 to purge the cache

[15:25:46] <alad> earnestly: yea but the terrible parts are in $arch $rel etc.
[15:26:09] <grawity> baltazar: letsencrypt directly contacts the authoritative servers
[15:26:22] <earnestly> alad: They're delimited by hyphens so the idea is to scoop up everything between them
[15:26:23] <grawity> baltazar: so just query your domain's authoritative servers
[15:26:23] <alad> Zambezi: consider that memory cards tend to die after a few months
[15:26:29] <alad> so check your journal
[15:26:38] <baltazar> grawity: ah. and how do I find out the address of that?

[15:26:58] <NetSysFire> phrik is a bot
[15:26:58] <phrik> Likely false.
[15:27:28] <grawity> baltazar: 1) they're listed in the "nameservers" page at your registrar (i.e. where you pay for the domain), 2) they're also listed in the domain itself as 'NS' records (at the root)
[15:27:30] <alad> earnestly: but surely there can be files delimited by the same amount of hyphens that are not package files
[15:27:32] <earnestly> alad: This old thing https://0x0.st/zegi.bin - might br wrong these days
[15:27:59] <baltazar> grawity: nice, thanks
[15:28:04] <earnestly> This awk seems silly tbh
[15:28:20] <grawity> baltazar: so `dig example.com ns` (or if something isn't working right, `dnstracer -s. example.com`) and then you do your query against each of those servers, like `dig _acme.blah.example.com txt @ns1.godaddy.com`
[15:29:04] <grawity> but in practice, most DNS hosts will push out changes to their authoritative servers in less than a minute, only few remain where it's on a 15-minute or 30-minute cronjob
[15:29:46] <alad> earnestly: I guess in practice you can simply assume that the pattern will only look in a pacman repo dir, where at worst you'll have stuff like .pkg.tar.namcap or .pkg.tar.log
[15:30:24] <alad> in that sense you don't need to encode pkgbuild(5) in a single regex

[18:16:53] <b-rex> what is a super long and how do web pages take it? and what does that have to do with arch?

[18:17:44] <grawity> a good way to find out things is run a packet capture and look for retries/retransmissions
[18:17:59] <Camelcruizer> sometimes web pages just take 20 minutes

[19:14:30] <moonshine> but yet it does.  for lba reasons
[19:14:32] <NeverSummer> NVMe drives are faster on paper, but they don't have any perceptible OS responsiveness improvement over SATA.  It would be nice if they did.
[19:14:32] <grawity> deeper queues, etc.
[19:15:38] <NeverSummer> I said SATA there I suppose I meant AHCI.
[19:16:10] <grawity> let's say those are the same thing, hopefully nobody is trying to use an SSD on an IDE-compat-mode SATA controller
[19:16:53] <NeverSummer> grawity, other way.
[19:17:03] <grawity> ?
[19:17:06] <NeverSummer> The confusion is that PCIe M.2 AHCI drives exist.
[19:17:14] <NeverSummer> As opposed to PCIe M.2 NVMe.
[19:17:24] <balrog> NeverSummer: are they common outside of Apple hardware?
[19:17:25] <NeverSummer> So just saying SATA ignores those.
[19:17:44] <NeverSummer> Look if anywhere was the place for pointless pedantry it's here.
[19:17:58] <NeverSummer> balrog, I've never seen one outside of Apple stuff.
[19:18:02] <grawity> I don't see how those are not SATA
[19:18:10] <NeverSummer> But I do have an Apple one and it's too dumb to not keep.
[19:18:43] <NeverSummer> grawity, it fits in an M.2 socket and communicates over PCIe?
[19:18:47] <balrog> Apple doesn't use m.2 anyway, they use a proprietary connector
[19:19:00] <balrog> used*
[19:19:01] <grawity> NeverSummer: that is not mutually exclusive with it using SATA
[19:19:18] <NeverSummer> I guess?
[19:19:26] <grawity> your built-in AHCI controller is still on PCIe
[19:19:27] <NeverSummer> I mean fine it supports sequential speeds higher than 6 Gb/s.
[19:19:31] <NeverSummer> Proving that it's not using SATA.
[19:19:37] <grawity> and the OS speaks the SATA command set to it in both cases

[21:35:44] <grawity> you can directly echo stuff to /sys, but it won't last through reboots

[22:48:30] <sept> I can get WiFi working manually with 'dhcpcd wlan0'. But it won't work on boot. Is it possible that what is going on is wpa_supplicant is trying to connect, but there's no DHCP. I get [DEPEND] Dependency failed for WPA supplicant daemon (interface-specific version). *Followed* by [OK] Reached target Network. Is it failing because systemd-networkd is enabling DHCP *after* wpa_supplicant attempts to connect?

[22:49:34] <sept> Or is this unrelated to DHCP? I know the drivers must be working because I surfed to web without ethernet connected.

[22:54:34] <remanifest> Hey everybody, I'm using KDE 5.22 with Wayland and SDDM. When I choose Switch User from the KDE menu, I'm not able to switch users; I can only unlock the account that I was just using, and the graphics on the display flicker. If I log out, this behavior doesn't happen.
[22:55:52] <sept> grawity: This is the booting message before the [DEPEND]: [ ***] A start job is running for /sys/subsystem/net/devices/wlan0.conf (1min 30s / 1min 30s)  What should I be investigating if I know the wireless does work when I do it manually using wpa_supplicant + dhcpcd?
[22:55:57] <LdK13> To switch user you must be root, maybe something is running as you instead of root?
