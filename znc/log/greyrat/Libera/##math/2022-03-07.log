[01:53:11] <ProfSimm> pounce: well it may be = but we wrote it in a specific order

[01:59:10] <joel135> i dunno

[10:32:25] <kado> ok. i think i missed the earlier discussion, then
[10:32:30] <greenbagels> i think thats a connection i forgot about though; my probability text introduced measure by already limiting to measurable sets
[10:32:36] <greenbagels> no no kado you have a fine comment to make :D
[10:32:55] <greenbagels> previously i think i was used to measure only being used in the context of measurable things

[12:28:56] <cadmio> ℤ_2(ξ) = {a + bξ | a,b ∈ ℤ_2, ξ^2 + ξ + 1 = 0}
[12:29:46] <Pollion> cadmio: Yes exactly, it is the same as x.
[12:30:15] <int-e> ξ^2 + ξ + 1 = 0 is a way to specify a "formal root of x^2 + x + 1"
[12:30:15] <Pollion> Your polynomial x^2+x+1 is irreducible over \F2, right ?
[12:30:25] <Pollion> In particular it has no root in \F2
[12:30:41] <Pollion> But, it has a root in an algebraic closure of \F2.
[12:30:51] <Pollion> Take one of such root, and call it \xi
[12:30:57] <cadmio> Pollion: yes it should be cause if it were reducible it would have a linear factor but it has no root in Z_2, right?
[12:30:59] <int-e> it's abstract; you can make it concrete if you let ξ = x + <x^2 + x + 1>, or ξ = x^2 + <x^2 + x + 1>
[12:31:32] <Pollion> Then adding \xi to \F2 gives you a "bigger field"
[12:31:37] <int-e> Or you can get it from an algebraic extension of Z_2 without worrying about its representation. (Not worrying about the representation is the point, really.)
[12:31:48] <Pollion> Exactly as when you considered Q(\sqrt(5)) a few weeks ago.
[12:33:05] <cadmio> so ξ is a root of x^2+x+1 which lies in the field ℤ_2(ξ)

[13:28:48] <int-e> So x + (x^2+x+1) is a root of p(z) = z^2+z+1 by construction, becayse p(x + I) = p(x) + I
[13:29:19] <int-e> And none of this tells you that x^2 + (x^2+x+1) is also a root of p(z), so you don't have all the roots either.
[13:31:59] *** Quits: loganlee[gnu] (~Thunderbi@user/loganlee) (Quit: loganlee[gnu])
[13:32:11] <cadmio> maybe selection is not appropriate term. But the fact there's the condition on x that x^2+x+1 = 0make x a root of x^2+x+1
[13:32:34] *** Joins: slidercrank (~slidercra@user/slidercrank)
[13:32:35] <int-e> But there's no such condition.
[13:33:09] <int-e> 0 + (x^2+x+1) = x^2 + x + 1 + (x^2+x+1) is a consequence of the definition of ideals.
[13:33:10] <cadmio> ℤ2[x]/(x2 + x + 1) = {a + bx | a,b ∈ ℤ_2, x^2 + x + 1 = 0}
[13:33:47] <int-e> NO, just no. Now you have two very distinct x, even though they happen to behave in the same way.

[18:13:47] <Koen> but that's a bit weird. of course the layer of connections are linear. so saying it's a "linear layer" is a bit redundant if "layer" doesn't include the activation function

[18:14:12] <CarloWood> Hi, I'm a coder and have a question regarding hash functions... If I have N random numbers of 64bits (uniformly distributed). Then how large is the chance that two of them have the same 32 least significant bits?
[18:14:49] <Decker> depends on the hash - how wide is the hash output?
[18:14:59] <Koen> CarloWood: P(at least two of them have the same 32 least significant bits) = 1 - P(none of them have the same 32 least signifiant bit)
[18:15:25] <Koen> this second probability is way easier to calculate directly
[18:15:49] <CarloWood> What is the second value?
[18:16:19] <CarloWood> I'd think it seldom happens - but I have like a collision EVERY try :/
[18:16:43] <Koen> I'm confused
[18:16:49] <Koen> you asked a question about random numbers
[18:16:58] <Koen> how is that related to hash functions?
[18:17:03] <Decker> really same 32 bits anywhere should be 1 in 4billion
[18:17:20] <Decker> the hash is a 64 bit number presumably(?)
[18:17:32] <Koen> Decker: that should depend on N
[18:17:45] <Decker> n * 1:4billion
[18:17:56] <Koen> that's an approximation
[18:18:00] <Decker> no
[18:18:16] <CarloWood> The hash is 64bit - but since I only look at the low 32bits, I guess it doesn't matter that the has is 64bit.  It's just about random 32bits being the same.
[18:18:24] <Decker> well ya in the english side... 1:0x100000000
[18:18:34] <Decker> ya
[18:18:46] <Koen> Decker: what's the probability that at least two people have the same birthday, in a class of 40 people?
[18:18:53] <Koen> hint: it's not 40/365
[18:18:57] <CarloWood> I think the chance is much higher than 1 in 4 billion - isn't this like the birthday problem?
[18:19:09] <Koen> you're correct, CarloWood
[18:19:48] <Koen> but most hash functions don't give a uniform distribution over all the possible strings
[18:20:04] <Decker> Koen but you don't have 40 numbers... you're comparing 1 vs 1 40 times
[18:20:09] <Koen> or maybe they do? I don't know
[18:20:18] <Decker> 40 people means you compute all the pairs... but you don't pair new tries vs another number
[18:20:23] <Koen> I don't know what "comparing 1 vs 1 40 times" mean
[18:20:28] <CarloWood> So, what is the chance that two numbers of 32bits of a set of 1000 are equal?

[18:33:15] <CarloWood> Interpreting as: 1000
[18:33:30] <Koen> "how large is the chance" is a bit convoluted
[18:33:38] <Koen> "what is the probability" might be more easily understood
[18:33:46] <CarloWood> And then it tells me that you can write it as "one thousand" and you can also write 'kilo'.

[18:34:36] <Payam63> No one?
[18:34:46] <CarloWood> Nothing I ever asked it
[18:34:46] <W> WA has been really poor lately; generally speaking it seems they have turned on some thing such that, if the problem is too hard/takes too long, the engine selectively misunderstands the input as a simpler problem
[18:35:24] <Koen> uh

[19:11:07] <bildramer> and the xor basically means the two things you xor are "independent" in a way, there isn't any real irreversible mixing
[19:11:25] <Xardas> https://ibb.co/DKr9bQv why is the limit here 2 instead of -7 ?
[19:12:04] <Xardas> It's a discontinuity function
[19:12:18] <Xardas> that's why it doesn't make sense to me
[19:13:16] *** Joins: kolexar (~kolexar@user/kolexar)
[19:13:28] <CarloWood> bildramer: yeah, the use of the xor is because I assume things are uncorrelated already at that point. I copied everything locally and will do some detailed tests to see what is going on that this results in so many equivalent bits.
[19:14:13] <bildramer> something like h ^= h >>> 33; h *= 0xff51afd7ed558ccdL; h ^= h >>> 33; h *= 0xc4ceb9fe1a85ec53L; h ^= h >>> 33; shamelessly stolen from murmurhash probably does the job
[19:14:37] <bildramer> >>> in sepples is std::rotr, I bet
[19:15:31] <bildramer> also keep in mind that the opposite (there's a good term for it I don't recall), "using random bits to choose future random bits" basically, can lead to this - many paths turn into one path
[19:15:39] <bildramer> it's tricky to get right

[19:16:41] <bildramer> Xardas: because for any value that's at 0+epsilon, the f() of it will be near 2, and not near -7
[19:16:50] <blei> but everything in neural networks is non-linear, including neural networks with linear activation functions
[19:16:50] <bildramer> for any nonzero epsilon
[19:16:56] <Payam5> hi A'x = b -> x'A=b' or x'A=b?
[19:17:12] <blei> so does a 'linear layer' refer to the connectivity pattern?
[19:17:25] <blei> ie fully connected, each neuron in this layer to each neuron in the next
[19:18:42] <Xardas> bildramer what do you mean by epsilon ?
[19:18:45] <bildramer> blei: why are networks with linear activation functions nonlinear?
[19:18:55] <bildramer> Xardas: sorry, h
[19:19:23] <blei> empirically, they can fit the same data as neurons with ie sigmoid, but just with less accuracy
[19:19:24] <bildramer> or in this case x, I guess? "the small value you add to x and take to go to 0"
[19:19:46] <bildramer> linear fits exist, and are worse, and that's consistent
[19:20:20] <blei> they are not that much worse in the grand scheme of things
[19:20:59] <Payam5> this channel sucks
[19:21:06] <bildramer> Payam5: if by A' you mean the transpose, then the first one is correct
[19:21:28] <Payam5> bildramer but isn't A'b = b'A?
[19:21:34] <bildramer> I prefer to interpret that as "nonlinearities aren't that much better" but in the right case, they are
[19:22:16] <Xardas> bildramer yes now I understood it
[19:22:18] <bildramer> pretty sure A'b = (b'A)'

[22:50:30] <blei> not according to max tegmark.
[22:51:22] <blei> hardcore string theorists and multiversalists think that it all exists simultaneously. or at least say so to get tenure.

[22:54:58] <blei> right. they disagree with you emphatically.

[23:57:51] <CarloWood> If N=2 - we only have a single pair - and the expectation value for the number of equal bits is 32; because the chance that any two bits are the same is 50% - and thus half of them will be the same.
