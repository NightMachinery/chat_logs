[00:33:41] <biys> and the ability to play on/off them
[00:33:52] <biys> i can move my hips like such and make you more likely to buy my product
[00:34:06] <biys> i can talk with such an inflection and make you more likely to buy my product
[00:34:28] <Parf> can you?
[00:34:40] <biys> there is much to be said about speaking with conviction as being a method by which people gain a following
[00:35:48] <econo> what kinds of things has your mom tried to convince you of wrt covid?
[00:35:53] <voltage_> that's perfect, you could study marketing, biys
[00:36:44] <biys> econo: that as a result of it being an active study and to some extent an experiment the entirety of the matter should be called into question
[00:37:21] <biys> for one.  there also seems to be questions about the narrative _along the lines_.  certain ideas being banned initially vs. certain ideas becoming more mainstream now
[00:37:43] <biys> the credibility of the central mouth pieces responsible for the narrative(s)
[00:38:15] <econo> many people seem deeply uncomfortable with epistemic uncertainty
[00:38:30] <biys> idk what epsitemic undertainty is
[00:39:00] <Parf> ah, the aleatory nature of humanity, THE VAGARIES, THE VAGARIES
[00:39:12] * Parf steps in the same river twice with a wry smile
[00:39:19] <econo> e.g being comfortable with the fact that scientists think the best protocols are one thing, but they aren't certain, and as we learn more they're likely to change
[00:39:41] <econo> but given what we know at a specific point in time, they're the best we can do
[00:39:54] <biys> gotcha
[00:39:58] <biys> and yes i agree
[00:39:58] <Parf> not necessarily, forethought is possible, econo
[00:40:08] <Parf> "if i have seen further, it is standing on the shoulders of giants"
[00:40:32] <biys> does that even fit in with the conversation at hand?
[00:40:35] <biys> hmmm
[00:40:36] <Parf> we can use those to predict what might happen, continuously, so the real state of things is somewhere far off, panging off unknown deterministic conclusions we're witnessing today
[00:41:03] <biys> unknown deterministic conclusions?
[00:41:22] <Parf> yeah, currently unknown things going on which will serve as catalysts to what happens later
[00:42:25] <biys> i think they're two different things
[00:42:50] <biys> i don't think anyone is disputing the fact that we can call with some level of accuracy the outcome of any particular situation or another
[00:43:01] <biys> but there is still that level of uncertainty
[00:43:16] <econo> predictions are not made in a vacuum though. So let's say someone happens to develop a methodology that is in fact better. Being justified in believing that methodology is its own process. It seems very unlikely that process will be more justified than, say, the CDC and NIH. Certainly not without a tremendous amount of resources and expertise
[00:44:14] <biys> where something just goes right off the rails
[00:44:18] <biys> "i never expected that"
[00:44:34] <biys> this reminds me of that movie with that tom cruise guy in it
[00:44:39] <biys> the precogs they called it
[00:44:44] <biys> the people that predicted the crimes before they happened
[00:44:56] <Parf> well, what's really at hand is the fact that we don't know what we don't even know we don't know. unknown unknown unknowns, one step deeper than the ol' rumsfeld syndrome
[00:45:04] <Parf> thus, it is best to do nothing
[00:45:21] <econo> minority report
[00:45:42] <biys> that isn't to say that we likely couldn't reach a point where the outcome could be predicted with enough information
[00:45:44] <econo> are you saying doing nothing is the best response or that that's what skeptics are experiencing?
[00:45:48] <Parf> we're all, as far as we know, committing actual atrocities as we speak, to those who witness us in the past. historically it's almost a guarantee
[00:45:56] <Parf> the less we do the better
[00:46:04] <econo> huh?
[00:46:21] <Parf> *in the future
[00:46:37] <biys> i've thought about that before.  what if XXX years down the road as a result of trivial action we're all doing right now the world stops existing
[00:46:44] <Parf> i meant, basically, that we are currently in the past being horrifying barbarians and we're not even capable of recognizing it
[00:46:46] <biys> that would be terrible
[00:46:48] <Parf> not even that
[00:47:22] <Parf> just that due to the gradual shift of social perception, philosophy, technology, we will be oafish freak monsters, given that humans make their way past this little bottleneck
[00:47:29] <biys> we are currently in the past
[00:47:34] <biys> that doesn't make sense to me
[00:48:16] <biys> we are currently in the past being horrifying barbarians and we don't even have the ability to recognize it
[00:48:19] <econo> even accepting that as true, how does it follow that we should do nothing?
[00:48:35] <Parf> well, the less we do, the less we'll be accused, surely
[00:48:47] <biys> you could be accused of innaction
[00:48:51] <econo> that makes no sense, especially in the context of, say, a pandemic
[00:49:13] <Parf> so you suggest that more is better
[00:49:23] <Parf> what i'm saying here
[00:49:50] <biys> i would say neither are good or bad.  depends on the person who's observing the result
[00:50:40] <Parf> doing nothing is best because it is made with this fate in mind, econo
[00:50:41] <econo> "more", whatever that might mean in context, isn't necessarily better. But doing nothing is merely one option in a set, and often not the right choice
[00:51:13] <Parf> for example, do you feel that conscientious objectors are good or bad?
[00:51:50] <biys> inherently?
[00:51:51] <econo> that depends on a lot of things
[00:51:57] <Parf> yes, in that given sense, i tell you that your act will save the world, and you do nothing, if we can see objectively that this is the case, then surely inaction is "evil"
[00:51:57] <biys> i think that would be circumstantial
[00:52:06] <Parf> but we're talking about a fate that no matter what we do, we'll be evil
[00:52:20] <biys> i missed that bit
[00:52:28] <biys> no matter what we'll be evil
[00:52:41] <biys> in that case it really doesn't matter one way other the other
[00:52:43] <Parf> i explained it above that we'll be seen for causing any number of atrocities, unknowingly
[00:52:46] <biys> you're damned if you do and damned if you don't
[00:52:46] <Parf> oh but it does
[00:53:20] <Parf> with the fact that you're "damned if you do anything at all", the "less you do" is best, clearly. unless you suggest actions are better
[00:54:02] <biys> i'm saying actions aren't inherently good or bad.  depends on who's observing the phenom
[00:54:14] <biys> it's where are axioms differ
[00:54:29] <Parf> so kicking a puppy to death is not inherently bad
[00:54:44] <Parf> i'm pretty sure whatever type of logic leads me to make that assumption, i have no use for
[00:54:45] <biys> i could think of a situation where kicking a puppy to death could be a good thing.
[00:55:11] <Parf> more like "the lesser of two evils", at best
[00:55:48] <biys> well.  not even that really.  it's all circumstantial depending on which lens, or whos lens, you're viewing the phenom from
[00:56:06] <biys> it might be bad for the puppy to be kicked to death
[00:56:34] <biys> could be good for the composition of the soil which grows a magnificent plant which cures cancer forever
[00:56:43] <Parf> then it's a lesser of two evils
[00:56:47] <biys> is the outcome of the puppy being kicked to death, in that case, not ``good'' ?
[00:56:49] <Parf> you're sacrificing the dog, but it's still bad.
[00:57:04] <biys> assuming dogs have some kind of contract with the universe suggesting they ought to live?
[00:57:23] <Parf> yes
[00:57:42] <Parf> the one that brought them to life, namely.
[00:58:44] <Parf> also, do you think that dogs are not 'of' the universe, but capable of being separated from it?
[00:59:38] <biys> it's the same contract?
[00:59:59] <biys> if i'm born does that mean i deserve clothing too?
[01:00:06] <biys> is this a contract with the universe?

[01:01:43] <Parf> that which is given at hand, upon the shoulders of giants

[01:03:21] <biys> oooh.  security by obscurity.
[01:03:33] <biys> i guess i should have qualified that.  i didn't know we were going this route
[01:04:31] <biys> in that case then YES people have a right to live as they've been granted that right existingly.  they have a right to die as well.  is there any indication as to how long a person is to physically exist in mind and spirit and body on earth?
[01:05:12] <Parf> yes, there is one indication of an abrupt end to a life that is against the said contract
[01:06:16] <biys> idk what that means
[01:07:01] <Parf> "is there any indication as to how long a person is to live", and to you, i say, there is one way of knowing when it has been cut short
[01:07:15] <biys> the amount of suffering it causes?
[01:07:18] <Parf> no.
[01:07:28] <biys> the amount of people affected?
[01:07:30] <Parf> no.
[01:07:50] <biys> the state by which it happens? (their life being cut too short)
[01:07:59] <Parf> not the state, that it happens at all
[01:08:11] <biys> because they aren't dying from natural causes?
[01:08:58] <Parf> that's probably a good way to put it, though there are instances even then when a life seems to be snuffed without merit.
[01:09:09] <biys> merit
[01:09:09] <Parf> natural causes in what sense, i would ask you
[01:09:56] <biys> all of this still smells of underpinning related to an idea about a perceived _best way to live within the universe_
[01:10:02] <biys> it's almost like stephan molyneaus UPB
[01:10:05] <Parf> as it should,
[01:10:45] <Parf> there isn't a best way to live, no. there are violations of the contract which i've alluded to above
[01:11:28] <biys> the contract is suggesting that here is a way things are supposed to be.  a...  cadence predestined by the universel as to how things are to go
[01:11:50] <Parf> yes. and the universe is known to go back on its own word
[01:11:54] <biys> :S/thet here is/that there is/
[01:12:24] <biys> i wonder if we will find the answer to the universe
[01:12:33] <biys> that would be game over... wouldn't it?
[01:12:34] <Parf> we are the answer to it
[01:12:38] <biys> it would be the singularity
[01:12:41] <Parf> "the universe examining itself"
[01:14:19] <biys> reminds me of a conversation with an old buddy that i just had
[01:14:29] <biys> he claims that to understand how everything around us works we need to look inwards
[01:14:38] <Parf> seems like good advice
[01:14:46] <biys> sounds very romantic
[01:15:02] <Parf> sounds cynical to dismiss romance
[01:15:09] <biys> i never did
[01:15:10] <Parf> we are here, after all, because of stories
[01:15:26] <biys> i'm sure a bit more than stories.  that seems like a pretty drastic oversimplification
[01:15:31] <biys> but i agree to some extent
[01:15:40] <Parf> well, yes, there were some things that came before, i agree
[01:15:41] <biys> the romance behind it
[01:16:00] <Parf> but what we have, what we're playing with, right now,
[01:16:19] <Parf> this whole human thing we're fucking around with, this is all narrative laced on narrative, the human book
[01:16:32] <biys> idk what you think you mean by that
[01:16:33] <Parf> it's gotten to be so much that it's ready to burst, give birth to something new
[01:16:36] <biys> "This whole human thing"
[01:16:38] <Parf> something beyond the story
[01:16:44] <biys> what story?
[01:16:51] <Parf> "the"
[01:16:54] <biys> you'll likely lose me here
[01:16:59] <Parf> i see it as the fundamental aspect of humanity
[01:16:59] <biys> the underpinning is not implicit
[01:17:11] <Parf> that without the story, humans were not yet humans
[01:17:17] <Parf> and will not be, once it is again gone
[01:17:32] <Parf> fables, tales, stories
[01:18:04] <biys> the human book
[01:18:08] <Parf> might extend further than i imagine, even rodents know how to tell when there's danger, who knows what secrets they talk about in their holes
[01:18:12] <biys> so... you mean like... the hisdtory of mankind?
[01:18:26] <biys> or are we talking about the social mores currentl in place dictating acceptableness?
[01:18:34] <Parf> no, not that
[01:18:40] <Parf> i'm talking about the language of context
[01:19:05] <biys> know how to tell when there's danger
[01:19:15] <biys> mice trap do exist!
[01:19:18] <biys> they seem to work
[01:19:19] <Parf> yeah, they even have sounds established to define certain types of animals
[01:19:26] <Parf> or even what they're wearing
[01:19:58] <biys> idk what you think you mean by "know when there's danger"
[01:20:04] <biys> that's a fairly generic idea
[01:20:18] <Parf> know how to express it, rather
[01:20:21] <biys> should i be expected to know that the elevator i'm on is about to collapse?
[01:20:23] <Parf> communicate it

[01:22:31] <Parf> i'm just perfectly willing to make some mistakes, is all
[01:22:43] <biys> you do have me lost on the suggestion that there is contracts and rules by which we are born and should exist within the world
[01:22:58] <biys> "born" for lack of a better term
[01:23:05] <biys> whatever that means to you
[01:23:09] <Parf> yeah, the contract was, explicitly, that they were alive to begin with, that the process of birth itself has occurred
[01:23:21] <biys> i get that
[01:23:25] <Parf> and that to cut it short is to do so as it is described, to cut short the life
[01:23:32] <biys> but that doesn't autoamtically migrate to the idea that you now deserve to live unmollested
[01:23:52] <Parf> i haven't said unmolested, suffering is fine
[01:23:56] <Parf> in fact, i think suffering is good
[01:24:03] <Parf> being killed, on the other hand
[01:24:15] <Parf> that is the severance of the contract of living, you understand
[01:24:20] <biys> what does that seem like such a far stretch to me?
[01:24:29] <Parf> a stretch from where?
[01:24:59] <biys> once you are brought into existence the universe is obligated to let you exist for a set amount of time?
[01:25:13] <Parf> i said myself the universe is known to breach said contract
[01:25:28] <Parf> after all, we are it. the contract is with itself.

[01:27:54] <Parf> we're getting close, or i was, contemplating the fact that life rides on the universe, is of it, and yet can conceive of that which is not it, as a process of its existence, and therefore creates, perhaps, on some frequency, that which is devoid "of" the universe, so to speak
[01:28:11] <Parf> i think he was referring to the universe itself being a simulation of itself, somehow

[01:33:23] <Parf> given that "happiness" is whatever you want it to be
[01:37:47] <biys> i'd likely change the qualification on that
[01:38:04] <biys> i don't think happiness is in and of itself subjective
[01:38:08] <biys> what brings happiness might be
[01:38:11] <Parf> well not the happiness,
[01:38:11] <biys> from individual to individual
[01:38:12] <Parf> i meant
[01:38:36] <Parf> you could pick happiness for whatever you mean it to be personally, you can. for the purposes of the discussion
[01:39:03] <biys> if we're going to talk about meanings of words, simply words, as being fluid then the conversation will disolve

[01:43:52] <biys> i've re-read what you've said about 20 times now
[01:43:57] <biys> as the realtor walks through my house
[01:44:01] <biys> asking my wife questions
[01:44:06] <biys> and i'm still kind of lost
[01:44:08] <Parf> ask them
[01:44:11] <biys> hahahaha
[01:44:31] <Parf> shouldn't your wife be asking the questions?
[01:44:42] <Parf> oh, it's your house already
[01:44:51] <biys> we're moving
[01:45:00] * Parf nods
[01:45:31] <Parf> if you were on the customer end i would have bullied you into asking the realtor probing philosophical questions
[01:45:39] <Parf> but you want him to give you a good price, so that
[01:45:45] <Parf> seems like an "evil" act
[01:45:53] <Parf> my bullying, that is
[01:46:13] <biys> wifes father says i talk very condescendingly to people
[01:46:25] <biys> so i tend to leave the person to person interactions for my wife
[01:46:34] <biys> specially if we ``need'' something from them
[01:46:41] <biys> my wife works in HR so she has the kid gloves
[01:47:33] <Parf> does it ever get bureaucratic between you two?
[01:48:30] <Parf> as to condescension, maybe you have "resting bitch idiosyncrasies"
[01:49:57] <Parf> i think i have it as well, too many people i've admired who were just using their wits to deceive me for whatever reason. the pure horsepower of a mind is not to be put to such uses without giving rise to backfires, corruptions, in the output
[01:52:20] <Parf> "you are the people you hang out with", if you read a bunch of pedantic philosophers, or technical studies, it's all matter of fact, it doesn't worry about a given subjective position and comprehension of the individuals being communicated with, nuance comes into play, kid gloves as you call them when your wife does it. in defense of bloviating, some people can only work things out in that process. sublime moments occur in conversation that don't in private

[01:54:15] <Parf> therefore, as practically as i can put it, it might be of use to create a model to deal with opposing philosophical viewpoints, that arranges them in such a way that it is automatically bad faith to oppose the rule in discussion, but also aligns them in such a way that it cannot be avoided even on purpose

[02:31:18] <Parf> so, are you more about the roleplay or the numbers going up, so to speak
[02:36:16] <lalia> Both. My approach to running a game has me focued more on mechanics in general, but I'm not especially committed to any particular ruleset and firmly abide by a standard of narrative over mechanics.

[03:55:27] <biys> Parf: could a model be established for the purpose of grading philos?
[03:56:12] <biys> lalia: you were sitting down to take a rip 'eh?
[03:56:14] <Parf> i'd imagine that's definitely possible
[03:57:05] <biys> the interpretation of the model would be problematic because you'd have to agree on predetermined ideas
[03:57:08] <biys> i'd think anyways
[03:58:06] <biys> we'd have to make some determinations about the universe that would be agreed upon across all philosophies
[03:58:10] <Parf> y'know, there's a burgeoning science that deals with seemingly contradictory states?
[03:59:13] <biys> can a model be created to compare and contrast different things?
[03:59:29] <biys> well this badboy has a 3.5litre v6 engine with vtec and this dog has long hair
[03:59:39] <biys> comparison - both okay
[03:59:39] <Parf> well i think the reliance on contrast is the problem here
[03:59:55] <Parf> contrast as a defining factor, anyway
[04:00:38] <biys> light is bright and dark is not
[04:00:47] <Parf> if for all intents and purposes, reality is subjective, or at least perception is
[04:01:09] <Parf> then we need to make how we deal with this subjectivity plastic TO the subjectivity
[04:01:25] <biys> i see particular aspects being subjective but i can't say everything is completely and entirely subjective
[04:01:39] <Parf> well, let's pare it down to philosophy and morals, then
[04:01:48] <Parf> we're practically then in the same boat
[04:02:21] <biys> i wouldn't even know where to start i don't think
[04:02:28] <biys> what makes a philosophy
[04:03:04] <Parf> that's a tough one
[04:03:19] <ethereal> specifying each ones views on typical topics and how they contrast
[04:03:39] <ethereal> but to grade one over another would be hard
[04:04:37] <ethereal> then there's the holistic effect of each one, where one may lack in something to some, as a whole may be supreme
[04:04:41] <biys> so we could say. a set of views?
[04:04:45] <biys> a set of views that what?
[04:04:52] <biys> determine the most accurate way to live within the world?
[04:04:54] <biys> the universe?
[04:05:02] <biys> the most accurate way for HUMANS to live within the world>
[04:05:12] <ethereal> to seek a way of living, that's one way i guess
[04:05:42] <ethereal> perhaps a definitive goal of 'one providing most <x>', whatever x is, happiness, absence of sufferin
[04:05:53] <biys> how do we rate the success of one philosophy over the other with regards to performance in that particular metric?
[04:06:39] <Parf> i think it might be better to try to arrange a way for them all to exist, contradictions and all, beside one another, without violent contention
[04:06:43] <ethereal> tough, if only there were a survey that asked people which pihlo they most ascribed to and rating their happines on a scale lol
[04:07:03] <ethereal> yeah Parf, leafs from many books probably result in the best
[04:07:35] <Parf> say an individual has an entirely libertine philosophy, this philosophy might lead them to say, rape and pillage at their whim. how can we philosophically incorporate these citizens without allowing them to violate a specific model, but also simultaneously being able to exist within the philosophy they come of naturally
[04:08:21] <ethereal> seems impossible, unless you perhaps ostracize them into a commune of only those who share that belief
[04:08:37] <ethereal> which isn't particularly integrating/cohesive
[04:08:43] <lalia> biys: felt like doing house chores while stoned. generally a more pleasant experience, I find.
[04:08:53] <Parf> seems impossible if one rests their model on a system that uses contradiction to order it
[04:09:15] <ethereal> indica cometh
[04:09:23] <Parf> admittedly, due to the type of thought it engenders, it seems impossible to have it any other way
[04:09:50] <Parf> though, that might be a vestige of the former, unworking system
[04:10:23] <ethereal> yeah, a set of values with priorities would need establishing first; then ranking each pihlo by how much they fit the value set. For many it'll again be a mix of many
[04:10:47] <ethereal> if only it was all math
[04:10:52] *** Quits: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[04:11:11] <Parf> really, the trick might be to change the environment in such a way that it somehow molds around the individuals without disrupting their actions, but makes it so that their actions can only follow one pre-established mode, namely, the one put forth by my proposition
[04:11:47] *** Quits: sebbu (~sebbu@user/sebbu) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[04:11:51] <Parf> so one can be utterly subjectively wanton, and riddled with anarchy, and still have a functioning place in the overarching system that does not disrupt others
[04:12:47] <biys> we are talking about a model
[04:13:20] <Parf> i'm not sure valuing each philosophy is the way to establish a system that can govern entirely contradictory states simultaneously
[04:13:51] <ethereal> what would be easier is probably ranking them by efficacy in a given task
[04:14:06] <ethereal> then taking each part and creating the ultimate! lol
[04:14:16] <Parf> is the value of the philosophy even important, if the system around it houses it in such a way that it makes them all suit one purpose, or goal, say, "infinite happiness", as we earlier discussed
[04:15:16] <ethereal> the ideal, yeah, but when one's ideas are the polar opposite to anothers
[04:15:31] <Parf> then it requires a model that transcend contradiction, no?
[04:15:36] <Parf> *transcends
[04:16:23] <ethereal> to transcend contradiction, one must remove the contradictors. end all conscious sentience
[04:16:32] <ethereal> lol
[04:16:38] <Parf> i disagree
[04:16:46] * ethereal gives up free will
[04:16:50] <Parf> to remove them is to change the individuals, the entire process
[04:16:51] <biys> could we rate each idea and it's perceived effectiveness based on accomplishing whatever goal/objective based on its own metrics?  give this a rating
[04:16:55] <Parf> who said we had that to begin with
[04:17:22] <Parf> no, i think that we must incorporate contradictions
[04:17:27] <ethereal> for the sake of determining ones views, to not have it would be having an external actor causing your views
[04:17:37] <Parf> mainly because they exist regardless of our attempts to stifle them
[04:18:13] <Parf> then the objective isn't exactly united beyond the individual, which just puts us where we are already, biys
[04:18:32] <ethereal> mm
[04:20:41] <biys> is the contradiction really important though?
[04:20:57] <biys> what we're doing is creating a rating system for the individual philosophies
[04:20:58] <Parf> insofar as it's a potential state, yes
[04:21:11] <Parf> well, then we have different objects entirely, i'd say
[04:21:23] <biys> i thought this was the goal.  lemme re read
[04:21:34] <ethereal> then contradiction shouldn't matter i guess
[04:21:49] <ethereal> as it's not a merging of philosophies as the goal
[04:22:04] <biys> that is what i thought as well
[04:22:15] <ethereal> but a mere rating of each one's efficacy for a given task/objective
[04:22:27] <biys> i think this could be accomplished
[04:23:12] <ethereal> such a project would be cool tbh, the ways in which the data could be presented would be cool
[04:23:21] <ethereal> would be hard to not be too subjective though
[04:23:41] * ethereal pictures a web form with 50 questions that ends up with "You most align with :x's philosophy!"
[04:23:44] <ethereal> lol
[04:23:54] <Parf> and why would being subjective be a problem, ethereal
[04:24:10] <Parf> is it perhaps due to other subjective and contradictory perspectives?
[04:24:19] <ethereal> because one persons "this is the most nihilistic view" is not the same for everyone
[04:24:37] <Parf> and so, contradiction is inevitable, so it's quite important.
[04:24:38] <ethereal> so for some things a consensus should be rached
[04:24:43] *** Quits: atmoz (~atmoz@user/atmoz) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[04:24:58] <Parf> so we choose the lesser of two evils, once more
[04:25:07] <biys> but why do you think the contradictions are important?  that seems like a whole other conversation to me
[04:25:08] <Parf> not everyone will be happy, but enough will be to outweigh those unhappy
[04:25:50] <Parf> honestly, i think the whole old format of gauging anything at all, from the ground up, is trash, and needs to be repurposed after tossing out the law of non-contradiction
[04:26:16] <biys> i have hands so i rate things by how handy they are
[04:26:24] <biys> - jbp
[04:26:32] <Parf> the way we have it now, is incapable of dealing with contradiction, it ignores it until ignoring it is inevitable,
[04:26:41] <Parf> then when it is inevitable, it chooses the lesser of two evils
[04:26:51] <Parf> it does not ever seem to try to change the system by which it reckons itself
[04:27:22] <Parf> identifying flaws in the system, to me, is important, and i think contradiction, or how it's seen, used, is flawed

[12:24:32] <badsektor> so about my analogy that the universe is like a computer program, in God's pc
[12:25:34] <badsektor> imagine you writing a program which can generate a world like ours, and characters like us, but the program is so good the choices of these characters cannot be predicted algorithmically, not even by the programmer
[12:25:52] <badsektor> so then he sits down to watch the show, because what else to do?
[12:26:09] <badsektor> it's been an eternity of no activity for him, he must be bored by now
[12:26:39] <Chwoka> i mean that's just like, a property of the halting problem and incompleteness theorem right? you don't even need to posit a complicated simulation
[12:26:45] <badsektor> he can watch the world like Cypher watches the matrix-world by looking at the screen with flowing green symbols
[12:27:17] <Chwoka> just something moderately more complicated than conway's game of life has unpredictable emergent properties
[12:27:56] <badsektor> yeah, i mean, i don't intend the analogy to analyse free-will, but instead i want to talk about how stupid the whole picture is, like, God creating a world and then communicating with humans demanding worship
[12:29:26] <badsektor> it is like you designing a rpg game, where you cannot be a character in, but you can somehow communicate to certain NPC's and tell them you want them to go act as your 'prophet' and tell the other NPC's that they should worship the programmer
[12:30:14] <badsektor> and then when you get mad you fire up the console, type in a few commands, and send a flood to kill all the NPC's
[12:30:29] <badsektor> but before doing that, you communicate to your favorite NPC that he should build a boat
[12:30:49] <badsektor> how bizarre, if you can tweak that generated world at will, why go all the hassle
[12:31:52] <Chwoka> this kinda only holds up if 1) we accept that the creator-god is metaphorically like a computer programmer and 2) we assert that most worshippers think of worship in transactional terms, neither of which hold true for i think most manifestations of religion in history, even manifestations of christianity outside of a modern american context
[12:32:14] <badsektor> how do you mean transactional
[12:32:49] <Chwoka> like, either i'm getting something because of my prayers, OR i am giving god something by praying, i am praying for god's benefit
[12:34:41] <badsektor> in our analogy, when you run your program to generate that world, and you fast forward the game time to the iron age, these NPC's have already started worshipping various personalized natural forces, mainly as a method to negotiate for their own survival, about things that directly impact their livelihood: disease, fertility, rain, crops, foreign invaders..
[12:34:57] <Chwoka> i think there are definitely people who think like that but it's not the universal motivation for worship. if taken uncynically it could be more like, "wow, this god who created everything there is in life sure is swell, let's celebrate him and this world he made," or rest on notions of spiritual purity, etc
[12:34:58] <badsektor> you just want the all credit to yourself, and all the groveling addressed for you
[12:36:02] <badsektor> what you are talking about is a later stage in the evolution of religion

[12:38:26] <Chwoka> so is your point that either god wouldn't want us to worship him because he stands to gain nothing and thus it is illogical, or that he stands to gain nothing and thus a hypothetical god character who actually did want us to worship him would be kinda a sick puppy with bad motivations?
[12:38:47] <badsektor> no i say religion is stupid because if you think about this is what it looks like
[12:39:11] <Chwoka> i'm an atheist too, to be perfectly clear
[12:39:25] <Chwoka> but this is an incredibly simple and reductive view of religion
[12:39:31] <badsektor> this is what God must be like, like character wise, and what he is doing in eternity all alone, playing these stupid games with computer program characters, to torture some of them forever after
[12:40:45] <Chwoka> first of all, what if the creator-god isn't really a "person". that was the understanding of god for most of christianity's history, even despite the whole jesus-as-human-as-god thing
[12:41:56] <badsektor> islam is my main focus it is my background religion, it is a 'simple and reductive' religion, i don't deny theism can come in more sophisticated and even edifying forms, but they don't have the same psychological power on me like islam does, so it is my focus
[12:42:42] <Chwoka> islam also has a history of aristotlean, abstract notions of god-as-pervasive-force, but alright
[12:42:55] <badsektor> now what would atheism be in that analogy? would it be a computer program running in no pc, with no programmer?
[12:43:04] <badsektor> no i am talking about muhanmad, not aristotle
[12:43:08] <badsektor> muhamad!
[12:43:17] <badsektor> have you read his work?
[12:44:37] <Chwoka> i was thinking mainly of avicenna and the illuminationists
[12:45:31] <Chwoka> which muhamad, the quran muhamad or another
[12:47:37] <badsektor> for the earlier and mentally formative years of my life i believed muhamad was God's chosen spokesperson, and now can see he was most probably a schizophrenic but rationally concluding something does not change your deepest conditioned thinking in brain circuits formed in your early years in life
[12:48:01] <badsektor> now it might sound stupid to you that someone could believe that! but it sounds equally stupid to me that someone can believe jesus christ is the son of god
[12:48:17] <badsektor> or that krishna is an avatar of God
[12:48:58] <badsektor> but raised in that religion makes it sound natural, even like "how could it be any other way?!"
[12:49:00] <Chwoka> it doesn't sound stupid to me. i'm an atheist but i try to give religious beliefs respect
[12:51:00] <badsektor> in the quran there are lines like this: "you are not insane muhamad, i hear what they say about you, oh i will make them suffer, like i destroyed the unbelievers of the earlier times, like people of noah, and people of this and that, i take vengence, you just wait"
[12:51:18] <badsektor> like literally, God speaking from the first person point of view
[12:52:15] <badsektor> so my computer program analogy, imagine God being such a guy, picking fights with the NPC's in the program that find it difficult to believe the one NPC he picked as his spokesperson is really God's spokesperson
[12:53:25] <Chwoka> i don't really get what the computer program metaphor does rhetorically here
[12:54:05] <badsektor> from the point of view of God, we are not even real, we are akin to NPC's in a rpg, or characters in a novel or a comic book, he himself composes!
[12:54:21] <badsektor> and he gets emotional, gets angry at them when he doesn't get worship, and makes them suffer
[12:54:34] <badsektor> imagine a Guy all alone in eternity, and doing that kind of studd

[19:31:32] <brigand> why pain?
[19:32:29] <pussipupu> Hey all
[19:32:51] <pussipupu> Sorry to hear Audrey, but yay holiday
[19:34:54] <audrey> brigand: Multiple health problems, including a botched surgery.
[19:35:01] <audrey> Long story and not very pleasant.
[19:35:06] <brigand> shit
[19:35:07] <audrey> This week is just particularly bad.
[19:35:27] <brigand> i hope you will get better
[19:37:12] <brigand> do you have at least access to working drugs?

[21:18:26] <arryana> bunny handles the buttons far more like my two do
[21:18:30] <arryana> stella, to me, looks stressed.
[21:18:40] <lalia> arryana: yeah, the studies people have documented are outstanding.
[21:18:56] <lalia> It's wild to see how different doggos handle the training.
[21:19:03] <arryana> what i'm curious to see is what training techniques work on what sort of dogs
[21:19:10] <lalia> Some seem really well suited to it, it's fascinating to see them develop.
[21:19:17] <arryana> in my own case, i taught one dog two buttons
[21:19:21] <arryana> and i never gave further instruction
[21:19:56] <arryana> the younger dog, and the cat, learned from watching the older dog, and whenever i add a button i simply program it and put it down, and they apply the context/understanding

[21:21:27] <arryana> the more sorts of people and dogs who engage in this, the more the way they/we communicate will get tested
[21:22:50] <lalia> Yeah, it's super interesting work, IMO.
[21:23:03] <arryana> i didn't expect the cat to use them
[21:23:15] <lalia> I love seeing the development of animal communication: we're discovering all sorts of wild shit.
[21:23:33] <arryana> and i didn't expect them to talk to each other with them
[21:23:35] <Parf> my cat modulates her meows to offer syllabic variations, and gives a distinct "hello" meow in the mornings, that she doesn't use again for the rest of the day
[21:23:53] <lalia> Like yeah, evidently they understand more about human language cues than we've ever previously been able to confirm.
[21:24:04] <lalia> Cool as fuck.
[21:24:42] <arryana> they listen all the time
[21:24:42] <Parf> the underestimation of animal's capacity for contextual understanding is one of those instances when man's hubris is a little too much to bear
