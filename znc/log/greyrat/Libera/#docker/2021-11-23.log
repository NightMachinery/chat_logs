[00:00:06] <ada_> data-root is settable from the daemon config file
[00:00:19] <DX099> and after that, you'll stop the docker service, redo your rsync, perform a daemon-reload, do a `systemctl cat docker.service |  grep "--data-root"` and upon confirming that your Exec line is configured, start the docker service again, and re-check the root dir with docker info

[00:34:31] <pycurious> ada_: why not just setup data-root on the docker.service executable instead of daemon.json? 
[00:34:42] <ada_> systemd unit files are less obvious
[00:35:38] <ada_> like, if you're trying to answer "how is my docker daemon configured" its arguably more obvious to check the daemon's config file and not the systemd unit file.  if you didn't know how overrides worked, you'd be looking probably at the base unit file, which isn't where this change exists - it's in the override file. 
[00:35:49] <ada_> so systemd overrides require specific knowledge of systemd, and the config file doesn't
[00:36:02] <ada_> it aligns with how you'd configure most other applications
[00:36:19] <pycurious> ada_: in the daemon.json file - can i just change data-root and nothing else? 
[00:36:20] <ada_> python calls this the principle of least surprise

[00:39:33] *** Joins: Windy (~windy@user/windy)
[00:41:04] <Windy> a coworker has set up a docker process using his own user account, and i need to move it to a service account.  it's currently run like "docker stack deploy --compose-file ./docker-compose.yml --with-registry-auth <repo>" but i'm not sure what auth was used for our private repo.  how could i discover this?  i have access to the old user account
[00:41:42] <ada_> so once the service is started by docker, i'm not sure what "user account" is involved anymore
[00:41:43] <ada_> can you elaborate?
[00:41:52] <ada_> are you concerned about the auth credentials that were used?
[00:42:44] <Windy> yeah, to auth to the dtr registry
[00:42:58] <ada_> there's not a good way to inspect the auth credentials on the service
[00:42:58] <Windy> i think i need to 'docker login' once from the service account to cache those credentials
[00:43:04] <ada_> yes thats step 1
[00:43:15] <ada_> then just do a docker service update or another stack deploy with the auth flag
[00:43:22] <ada_> the service will get updated with the new credentials
[00:43:36] <Windy> but i can't tell from .docker/config.json for instance what user was previously used for the dtr auth?
[00:43:49] <ada_> why does that matter if you're going to update it and rewrite them?
[00:43:58] <ada_> like, you can view a user's auth token IF that user logged in
[00:44:12] <ada_> but there's not a good way to see which auth token was used on the _service_ itself by inspecting it
[00:44:28] <pycurious> _ada - it worked ! Thanks
[00:44:41] <Windy> i don't know if my colleague used his own account to auth to dtr, or some service account that exists on dtr for this purpose
[00:45:17] <Windy> i can see the "auth" and the "identitytoken" on the config.json, just have no idea what they correspond to

[03:11:47] <rawtaz> SenoraRaton: sounds like you have a permissions issue. can you show the complete output from that docker-compose up command?
[03:11:54] <rawtaz> (including the error)
[03:14:38] <SenoraRaton> https://termbin.com/cu7qi
[03:14:48] <SenoraRaton> This is when I run docker-compose up
[03:16:13] <SenoraRaton> Is the permission issue interior?  That doesn't make any sense, but if I run sudo docker-compose up it still gives the same output.
[03:16:27] <rawtaz> SenoraRaton: that is not an error from docker, it's from the server inside the container, see https://gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/-/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L160
[03:17:50] <rawtaz> its most likely a permissions issue. make sure that the uid that runs the software that gives this error message has write permissions to the paths that you bind mount into the container
[03:18:21] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[03:18:23] <rawtaz> another possibility is that it's trying to create some folder or files in another path than those you bind mounted into in the container
[03:18:55] <SenoraRaton> That was my thought at first, because otherwise IN the container the container should not have file permission issues, and the error is IN the container.

[03:20:30] <rawtaz> well inside the container the software could still try to write to some path it doesnt have permissions to.

[03:26:12] <SenoraRaton> rawtaz Yes.  I looked at the code, and its trying to write to "porting::path_user" although I'm not sure where that is defined.
[03:26:50] <SenoraRaton> https://github.com/minetest/minetest/#paths  There is this.
[03:29:03] <rawtaz> so is that ~/.minetest ?
[03:30:16] <SenoraRaton> I guess?  Why wouldn't the container have write access to its home directory?
[03:31:14] <SenoraRaton> I will say "sudo docker create -v /home/minetest/data/:/var/lib/minetest/ -v /home/minetest/conf/:/etc/minetest/ registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:master
[03:31:19] <SenoraRaton> Works, and the server comes up.
[03:32:20] <SenoraRaton> O no, "sudo docker run registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:latest" comes up and runs, the previous command just sets the config directories I believe.

[10:14:50] <shugo> and i don't need root to run docker commands, so why are the folder/file in the mounted volume requiring root ?

[13:11:24] <talin> hello. most of the guides i find for setting up simple containers don't use docker-compose. i've heard someone say you should always use docker-compose. thoughts?

[13:13:01] *** Quits: nickdiaz1wag209 (~bjpenn_@13.110.54.42) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:13:28] <LordKalma> well, simple things I don't think is worth bothering
[13:13:51] <LordKalma> keep in mind though, that like, for example, if you want to update your containers you may need to remember (aka have written down) the command you used
[13:14:13] <talin> is this if i use docker-compose? or if i don't use it?
[13:14:14] <LordKalma> for example, I have portainer deployed with like 2 or 3 different settings from the copy-paste command offered in the official guides
[13:14:24] <LordKalma> if you don't I mean
[13:14:37] <talin> aha, so that could be an argument for using docker-compose
[13:14:40] <LordKalma> so I do have a txt will all the docker commands I ran so I remember the settings 
[13:14:42] <LordKalma> haha indeed
[13:14:49] <LordKalma> even for a single container is a good way to store your settings
[13:14:54] <LordKalma> like ports mapping and suchj
[13:15:04] <LordKalma> volume locations, that sort of stuff
[13:15:25] <talin> cool, so i will learn docker-compose works and start using that :)
[13:15:25] <LordKalma> of course that if the scenario involves more than 1 container talking, then it's compose all the way
[13:15:29] <LordKalma> imho at least
[13:15:33] <LordKalma> it's not hard to learn
[13:15:36] <LordKalma> it's a YAML file
[13:15:47] <LordKalma> look at any other docker-compose file and you've seen them all
[13:16:18] <talin> oh, okay :)  awesome, thank you sir
[13:16:46] <LordKalma> the largest tip to remember about docker-compose is:
[13:17:04] <LordKalma> service names are hostnames. you might not understand it now, but it'll be of great use ;)

[13:17:24] <talin> oooh, okay. i will write that down to save me some frustration later
[13:17:24] <LordKalma> for example, in this simple file I wrote a while ago
[13:17:26] <LordKalma> https://github.com/ruilvo/radioamadorismo-website/blob/master/docker-compose.dev.yaml
[13:17:41] <LordKalma> see how there's a service called `db`?
[13:18:04] <LordKalma> that means the database is available on http://db:[whatever the port was]
[13:18:16] <talin> aaah, okay, that wasn't very intuitive
[13:18:30] <LordKalma> the frontend can call the backend with http://backend:8000/api/[....]
[13:18:31] <talin> i thought it was just like a variable name or description name
[13:18:46] <LordKalma> yeah, it's more useful than that

[13:20:32] <talin> nice, this will come in handy. i'm just setting up a bunch of individual services on a machine
[13:20:48] *** Joins: incognito (~UserNick@user/incognito)
[13:20:52] <talin> just to keep the machine clean
[13:21:16] <LordKalma> yeah, I mean, docker has an extensive system of internal networks and etc, and containers can communicate internally without any exposed ports or without a docker-compose
[13:21:28] <LordKalma> you can just add individual containers to virtual networks docker itself provides
[13:21:45] <LordKalma> do't ask me how, never did it, don't know about it more than I already said
[13:22:09] <LordKalma> but when you want like a group of cohesive services, yeah, docker-compose is nice
[13:22:21] <talin> i see. well, i want them totally separated for now, but it's cool that this stuff exists
[13:22:27] <LordKalma> if your services aren't supposed to be cohesive, don't shove them in the same file
[13:22:42] <talin> oh right, so separate docker-compose files
[13:23:18] <LordKalma> yeah, like, imo, a docker-compose file should describe a set of cohesive services making themselves a service for the "user"
[13:23:55] <LordKalma> why couple your, imagine, VPN service and your wordpress instance?
[13:24:16] <LordKalma> you could make the argument that it's part of your "complete server service"
[13:24:22] <LordKalma> and there's that argument to be made indeed
[13:24:25] <LordKalma> but you get my point

[13:27:49] <talin> that makes sense. i'm also confused about when to use public images. like should i use the nginx-docker or should i just make a dockerfile with some distro and nginx in it?
[13:27:53] <talin> for example
[13:29:02] <LordKalma> whatever suits you
[13:29:23] <LordKalma> when I find images with what I want I'm more than glad to use them
[13:29:23] <LordKalma> hahah
[13:30:30] <talin> right, right
[13:31:03] <LordKalma> in that link from my repo I'm making two images myself because I had to

[20:03:15] <programmerq> but as far as I recall, there isn't a scope=* that you can get

[21:23:58] <eyJhb> Yeah, seems like I have to make an endpoint to generate them for each repo I want to touch... :/
[21:24:10] <eyJhb> Hope for a wildcard one. And I don't want to implement a full server
[21:24:17] <eyJhb> Or... Do I? No.
[21:27:59] <programmerq> if you go basic auth, it's kind of an all-or-nothing type approach
[21:28:13] <programmerq> not sure if that serves your needs any better

[21:30:05] <eyJhb> Sadly not, as I need the specific auth for providing scoped access to 'workers' that pull X image.. But then I need an admin user, that can push those images as well.
[21:30:44] <eyJhb> So I can either setup a small auth server, that can handle this, or just... Generate a token each time. Since I am not going to interact with the server using the docker cli
