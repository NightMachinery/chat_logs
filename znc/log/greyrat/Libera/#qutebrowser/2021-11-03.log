[18:08:09] <earnestly> The-Compiler: Is there a reasonable way to disable css animations?  Sort of report that the feature isn't available
[18:16:39] <The-Compiler> earnestly: perhaps via user stylesheets somehow
[18:17:15] <earnestly> Hm, could :none !important; them
[18:18:01] <The-Compiler> earnestly: https://dev.webonomic.nl/how-to-disable-css-transforms-transistions-and-animations
[18:18:14] <The-Compiler> earnestly: not much more qutebrowser can do if Chromium doesn't expose a way to disable them
[18:18:24] <earnestly> Yeah of course, I wondered if it might
[18:18:48] <earnestly> I can probably get away with just disabling animation as that's what most of those text "skeleton" placeholders use
[18:26:37] <earnestly> The-Compiler: Hm, I added config.set('content.user_stylesheets', config.configdir / 'css/no-animation.css') - but it doesn't appear to have loaded, :set ...user_stylesheets doesn't list it either
[18:26:48] <earnestly> Am I missing something
[18:27:15] <The-Compiler> earnestly: not really, perhaps you set it elsewhere?
[18:28:51] <earnestly> The-Compiler: Hm, > Invalid value '/home/earnest/.local/etc/qutebrowser/.local/etc/qutebrowser/css/no-animation.css' - Must be an existing file (absolute or relative to the conf ...
[18:29:00] <earnestly> So it looks like it just wants the css/... part
[18:29:29] <earnestly> That appears to have worked
[18:30:02] <earnestly> If that's a bug, the bug would be that it's adding the configdir to the prefix even though the prefix is absolute (starts with /)
[18:30:31] <earnestly> (The :help documentation doesn't mention this feature)
[18:30:52] <earnestly> Either way, it worked, and now I don't get 94% CPU usage visiting github anymore \o/
[18:31:00] <The-Compiler> earnestly: can you try if  str(config.configdir / 'css' / 'no-animation.css')  works?
[18:31:48] <earnestly> The-Compiler: https://0x0.st/-nhX.txt
[18:32:20] <earnestly> Oh str
[18:32:43] <earnestly> The-Compiler: Yeah that worked
[18:33:19] <earnestly> I don't need split 'css' either, it's just the str() that appears to fix it.
