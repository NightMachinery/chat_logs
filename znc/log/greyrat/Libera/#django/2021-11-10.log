[00:27:21] <strk> I've a `class Parcel(models.Model)` with no __init__ but a bunch of out-of-def code (is that class initialization code?)
[00:28:09] <strk> the geometry field in that class seems to be initialized like this:
[00:28:10] <strk> geom = models.MultiPolygonField(srid=32040, null=True)
[00:28:27] <strk> ie: there is NO mention of a field name (is that defaulting to "geom" from the variable name ?
[00:28:38] <strk> also there's no mention of the table (is that defaulting to "parcel" from the class name ?

[00:30:05] <strk> just experimenting
[00:30:39] <GinFuyou> Mostly you can just leave everything to ORM

[00:32:01] <strk> uhm, db_table didnt' seem to work
[00:32:11] <strk> django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: column backend_custom_view.lot_size_sf does not exist

[12:47:33] <lelouche22> Hi guys I need help with Django API
[12:47:33] <lelouche22> I’m using Django 2.2 and I have a rest api that gets the list of virtual machines from a server. On these machines you can create schedules, a task. So there is VirtualMachines and Schedules with manytomany relationship.
[12:47:34] <lelouche22> In my schedule creation page, I display the list of all virtual machines in checkboxes inputs, so we can select which machine to give a shedules and it also displays existing schedules that are linked to other virtual machines.
[12:47:35] <lelouche22> Except that when I send the form I get an error: 'dict' object has no attribute 'pk' in my view vm_schedule_create in form.is_valid().
[12:47:35] <lelouche22> what I don't understand yet, is that the post request is good, it sends the value of the input. but it's during the validation that it crashes. (I think)
[12:47:36] <lelouche22> In my form I use ModelMultipleChoiceField and a queryset with values(). which gives me a dictionary and a string where I loop to access it. To recover the schedules I use a custom filter where I get the virtual machines with the primary key.
[12:47:36] <lelouche22> I think my code will speak for it self.
[12:47:36] <lelouche22> https://dpaste.org/Qz0m
[12:49:47] <FunkyBob> lelouche22: did you paste tthe full error message anywhere?  as requested by the topic
[12:52:18] <FunkyBob> also why do you have values() on the queryset for the ModelMultipleChoiceField ?
[12:52:26] <FunkyBob> itt wants to operate on whole models, not lists
[12:56:14] <lelouche22> FunkyBob I just add the error in https://dpaste.org/4zwj
[12:56:14] <lelouche22> and because i'm trying to improve my load page I have to much data in the creation form over 2000 VirtualMachine
[12:56:15] <lelouche22> So I use values() because I juste want the Id and the name of the VM.
[12:56:37] <FunkyBob> then you can't use ModelChoicesField
[12:56:48] <FunkyBob> make it work first, then speed it up
[12:57:19] <FunkyBob> ok, first.. that's not the FULL traceback... and secondly, it's not the error you mentioned before
[12:57:44] <FunkyBob> stop hiding all the useful basic details
[12:57:50] <FunkyBob> like which line the error occurred in

[12:58:38] <FunkyBob> also
[12:58:48] <FunkyBob> for someone concerned abouit spped... this is REALLY not smart - https://dpaste.org/4zwj#L85,86
[12:59:14] <FunkyBob> list(queryset) would be enough... but even better would be to justt iterate the queryset naturally
[12:59:42] <FunkyBob> and even easier is to do away with the template filter, and access the related objects naturally via the ORM
[13:00:13] <FunkyBob> but you fucked yourself tthere by doing away with the objects... and thus triggering 2000 queries instead of 2
[13:02:07] <FunkyBob> why is your 'label' a JSON blob containing some other objects 'pk'?

[13:16:10] <FunkyBob> it's hard to tell with so little data, but this may be a side effect of you passing values() lists instead of models

[13:30:51] <FunkyBob> stop using values() for the field queryset
[13:31:15] <FunkyBob> if you want to improve the load time, measure what's actually consuming the load time
[13:31:28] <FunkyBob> that inline DB hit you have inside a loop is likely your biggest culprit

[14:13:21] <FunkyBob> once you explain that, I'll show you, step by step, why that function should be a single line
[14:13:32] <lelouche22> FunkyBob because in create I have all the VMs but I also wanna retreive the Shecules where the VMs have already a Schedule associated with them
[14:13:42] <FunkyBob> oh, but first... how many DB queries do you think that function does? and how many total for the page does it cause?
[14:15:15] <lelouche22> FunkyBob I don't know but look at the picture https://ibb.co/mzmSmry
[14:15:35] <FunkyBob> yes, I figured that out
[14:15:38] <lelouche22> FunkyBob on the left my VMs and on the right my shecules
[14:15:58] <FunkyBob> ok, ever time you call get_schedules you cause _2_ DB queries
[14:15:58] <FunkyBob> https://dpaste.org/btJN#L22,24
[14:16:38] <FunkyBob> firstly, building the list of models from the queryset could just be list(myvm.vmschedule_set.all())
[14:16:46] <FunkyBob> instead of that painfully slow loop
[14:16:53] <FunkyBob> you can do this because querysets are iterable
[14:17:02] <FunkyBob> which also means... you don't need the list at all
[14:17:16] <FunkyBob> you can return the queryset, and let the template iterate it directly
[14:17:46] <FunkyBob> lelouche22: are you following?
[14:17:52] <FunkyBob> would you like me to clarify any point?
[14:18:58] <lelouche22> you mean change my queryset in the form ?

[14:25:40] <lelouche22> FunkyBob it's when an object it's returning element one by one when you loop in it

[15:08:21] <gkarthik> Hi, I want how exactly session authentication happens. How user object is attached to the request? The docs are not clear on this.

[15:13:12] <gkarthik> I know that there is an authenticate method which takes request and other arguments like credentials for authenticating. If authentication is successful. It returns the auth user object else an anonymous user object. But how this user is set as an attribute to the request object?

[15:13:17] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[15:26:00] <gkarthik> Usually the authenticate method s used to verify username and password, which is basic authentication. But in case of a session id, how user object is fetched from session table? I thought that session middleware might be adding the user attribute to request. But no it is just adding the session attribute

[17:11:24] <TuringSystem> I humbly come to ask for your help with an error that is exotic enough to have left me without an answer after my research.
[17:11:25] <TuringSystem> https://dpaste.org/h61w
[17:12:36] <TuringSystem> In units tests, I get an error on primary key integrity while attempting to create an object with the id 2 (automatically defined by Django ORM) while there is only 1 objects with the id 1 on the same table
[17:15:18] <TuringSystem> As Django ORM try to create the object with the id 2, I understand that the sequence has the proper value, but still can't create the object on the database. I also check the database in use, and it's the Unit Test one, automatically generated.
