[00:03:53] <Kodiak_IT> Anyone have any ideas what might be causing VLC to have audio issues when trying to resume playback? (It'll cut in and out, but it'll be fine after a few seconds)
[00:04:16] <NetSysFire> !gts
[00:04:17] <Kodiak_IT> Likewise, johnnnyapol!
[00:04:17] <phrik> (1) Please run this application in a terminal, inspect and maybe !paste the output (if possible). (2) Check and optionally !paste your journal. (3) Did you check the bugtracker (see !bugs)? If this program has a forum/issue tracker, did you check that, too?

[06:27:07] <mpan> If you want to simply update, -Syu is exactly what you need. Double -yy is needed if one *knows* their sync databases are broken. -yyuu is needed for downgrade using ALA. Some would also argue that -yy -yyuu may be needed for changing mirrors, but equally large group — me included — will oppose the idea.
[06:27:07] <Hello71> !Syyu
[06:27:08] <phrik> The double yy in `pacman -Syyu` is almost never needed. If you're switching to a mirror that uses an older copy of the repos, see !Syyuu instead. Unless your repo databases are completely corrupted, force-downloading already-up-to-date ones accomplishes nothing other than to waste bandwidth and server load. Do your part in conserving the internet, and avoid Syyu!

You either have to edit the PKGBUILD and tell make to use an older version of gcc or you have to edit the source to make it compliant with C++17 and build it yourself.

[15:12:07] <kaji> Ah this is great
[15:12:10] <kaji> I'll look into it
[15:12:11] <MrElendig> or physically travel to the device, or call someone at said location

[15:16:29] <MrElendig> anyway, if you don't currently have out of band access then you need to get physical access, either by you or a proxy

[15:34:20] <baltazar> I have a machine I want to be able to ssh to, so I created a service which ssh's home (which has a known ip), and creates a reverse port forward to its ssh port. sometimes my router restarts or something causes the ssh connection to die, which would be fine since the service will just keep trying to connect. however, often only the client notices that the connection died, and the session remains on 
[15:34:26] <baltazar> the server, so when the service tries connecting again, ssh will just say "Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port"
[15:35:32] <MrElendig> sounds like you want a vpn instead
[15:35:46] <baltazar> whenever this happens, I have to manually kill its session on the server, after which it will reconnect successfully
[15:36:15] <MrElendig> other than that, tweak the keep-alive and watchdog values?
[15:36:39] <baltazar> MrElendig: I already have -o TcpKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=15

[19:00:13] <mikey> hey. I'm pretty sure this is a hardware issue but mentioning here just in case and because you are all smart people. At some point last night, the screen on my laptop went crazy. looked kind of like a flickering checkerboard. had to force reboot. now I have a few stripes on the display that flicker with some other image - maybe what it was frozen on last night. When I have solid black on the display it 
[19:00:19] <mikey> goes away. anything else you I can see some residual image overlayed on what is supposed to be there. is my screen just toast? I just took it all apart, cleaned the inside. Also just did a full system update which requires a reboot right now. brb.

[20:50:49] <Mocramis> Hello, Since i have a weak connection, i am only updating ont of my local machine, then i serve what i dled to the other machine by serving /var/cache/pacman/pkg with a dumb http server
[20:51:35] <Mocramis> the other machines are configured to have http://<local_ip>:8080/ first in their mirror list
[20:52:35] <Mocramis> however, since recently, It seems that not all request are first sent to my local mirror: in fact, after the first few, most of them are sent to other mirrors on the mirrorlist.

[22:31:19] <MrElendig> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Custom%20keyboard%20layout%20definitions#Editing_an_existing_layout  you can inherit from the la layout and just add defenitions for the two keys you need
[22:31:20] <phrik> Title: Custom keyboard layout definitions - Community Help Wiki (at help.ubuntu.com)
[22:31:55] <MrElendig> there are a bunch of other tutorials on how to create custom layouts too
[22:32:00] <demize> Or just use the layout that matches your keyboard and use XCompose to get any characters not present on the keyboard.

[22:32:24] <MrElendig> could use xmodmap, but the downside is that it often ends up in a fight with your DE if you use one
[22:32:55] *** Joins: kulak1 (~kulak@user/kulak)
[22:32:59] <MrElendig> us international have some of the spanish characters
[22:33:02] <ttnk> i think it would be better to just use the layout as it is and add those 2 keys

[22:34:27] <demize> MrElendig: Oof, that tells you to edit system files.  :|
[22:34:30] <MrElendig> personally I would grab a iso layout keyboard

[23:42:35] <kuhilas> Installing arch linux on a hp laptop and I'm partitioning the disk where I have windows 10 and I want to leave it there. So I figured that I have an UEFI system and I would not need an own partition for GRUB. I have EFI System partition etc. But then fdisk -l says "Disklabel type: gpt". Then I'm reading on arch wiki that "GRUB requires a BIOS boot partition with type BIOS boot when installing GRUB to a GPT partitioned disk." and also "For UEFI
[23:42:35] <kuhilas> systems this extra partition is not required, since no embedding of boot sectors takes place in that case. However, UEFI systems still require an EFI system partition." So I'm not sure if I need it or not
