[02:00:47] <larryv> or, perhaps, it means a *lot* of things
[02:00:55] <SchmoSeph> Uh
[02:01:06] <SchmoSeph> So like say you got a brand new computer
[02:01:11] <SchmoSeph> Out of the box
[02:01:13] <larryv> there are lots of things that influence the "state" of what you have in a terminal window
[02:01:22] <larryv> llua already mentioned how to remove your user's zsh prefs
[02:01:35] <larryv> there's also the settings for the terminal emulator itself
[02:02:00] <SchmoSeph> zsh -f?
[02:02:22] <larryv> this is a temporary thing?
[02:02:34] <SchmoSeph> ?
[02:04:03] <larryv> running zsh -f just ignores most startup files
[02:04:18] <larryv> it doesn't, like, delete your ~/.zprofile or whatever
[02:04:38] <SchmoSeph> I want to start from scratch
[02:08:11] <jklfds> delete zsh files in your home directory and you're starting from scratch
[02:09:01] <larryv> ^ that's about as much as you can do as far as zsh is concerned, but it's not everything. the rest is OS-specific

[14:33:53] <osse> how would you use it
[14:33:57] <lxsameer> but apparently I can't use . as it is, I might need some escaping which I don't know how
[14:34:43] <lxsameer> osse: that my_function will cd up according to number .s passed to it
[14:35:12] <lxsameer> so .... would be cd ../../..
[14:35:33] <osse> that's not a suffix alias
[14:37:20] <lxsameer> osse: it could be
[14:38:02] <lxsameer> if I use `.` as a suffix alias, then `...` will call my_function with `.` as input
[14:38:16] <lxsameer> the rest would be up to the function to take care of it
[14:38:31] <lxsameer> I've tried it with other chars and it works
[14:38:54] <lxsameer> the only issue is that I need to set it for a single dot char
[14:40:28] <osse> that's not a suffix alias
[14:40:32] <osse> oops
[14:40:38] <osse> I pressed up too much
[14:40:52] <osse> Seems to me like defining such an alias works, but zsh won't invoke it.
[14:42:09] <lxsameer> the one with `.` specifically or the idea in general?
[14:43:01] <osse> I mean if I type 'alias -s .=rofl'  and then 'alias -s' afterards I see the dot alias in the list. Same if I try e.g. 'alias -s "\x"=rofl'  
[14:43:15] <osse> But when I type anything that ends in . or \x  nothing happens, as if the alias didn't exist
[14:44:04] <lxsameer> ah gotcha
[14:44:05] <osse> which leads me to believe no kind of escaping will solve this, because the problem is internally in how zsh uses the aliases

[15:47:35] <Mikachu> i think i've updated that slightly since
[15:48:01] <Mikachu> if i type . after .. and it turns into ../.. i can hit undo to get ... (and again to get back to .. of course)
[15:48:46] <Mikachu> though it looks like you've changed it too
[15:49:57] <Mikachu> since you do arr assign to split, shouldn't the if on the next line be pointless, you can always do [-1] to get the whole element without getting character subscripting
[15:51:09] <osse> yep, that's pointless
[15:51:41] <osse> the only other change I've done is change :a to :a:h because that felt more natural
