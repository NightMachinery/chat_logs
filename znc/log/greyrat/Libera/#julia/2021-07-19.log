[22:32:47] <tane> howdy
[22:33:08] <tane> are there some docs/tools, to automatically vendor depedencies into some folder inside my project-folder?
[22:33:48] <tane> I read that it's possible to use the project/manifest files to let lookup point to arbitrary folders, but copying stuff there automatically would ease that process I guess
