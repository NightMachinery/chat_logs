[00:00:10] <dminkovsky> radiators i think
[00:00:28] <dminkovsky> buildings i lived in in chicago and new york that were 100 years old were all radiators

[00:01:15] <manicennui> dminkovsky: All of the gut rehabbed buildings end up with central air.
[00:01:27] <manicennui> I wish I had radiant floor heating.
[00:01:28] <dminkovsky> cause you can control it
[00:01:34] <dminkovsky> but yeah it sucks
[00:01:43] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[00:01:59] <manicennui> All of the options for cooling suck.
[00:02:08] <dminkovsky> there is only one?
[00:02:19] <manicennui> Basically.
[00:02:43] <manicennui> Although it could be central or room units.
[00:02:51] <dminkovsky> i'm an AC hater and try to go fans as much as possible but eventually it becomes absurd and AC wins
[00:03:04] <dminkovsky> also with young childen i don't understand how they managed their sleeping w/o AC
[00:03:26] <manicennui> Whiskey.
[00:03:41] <dminkovsky> probably
[00:03:45] <dminkovsky> how else i don't know
[00:04:29] <dminkovsky> i went on to string of stores just now
[00:04:36] <gwozniak> Our building still uses radiators, but they look like electric baseboard heaters
[00:04:50] <dminkovsky> at wegmans the proper masking was remarkably uniform
[00:04:59] <dminkovsky> target too
[00:05:09] <dminkovsky> and no mask mandate
[00:05:41] <dminkovsky> interesting, gwozniak
[00:05:53] <gwozniak> No A/C here either
[00:05:53] <dminkovsky> baseboard heaters are electric, and these are proper stream radiators?
[00:06:06] <dminkovsky> does it get past 25C much?
[00:06:15] <gwozniak> It's hot water, I believe
[00:06:41] <gwozniak> I live on the top floor, and it's typically 26C or higher this time of year.  We usually need to keep a window open
[00:06:50] <dminkovsky> oh i mean outside, in the summer
[00:07:03] <manicennui> A bunch of places in the US that went without AC in the past are now pretty unbearable without it at some point during the summer.
[00:07:03] <dminkovsky> (since you said no AC)
[00:07:04] <gwozniak> Yeah, gets warm here in the summer
[00:07:25] <dminkovsky> i'd live perfectly comfortably if the max high outside was 25-26
[00:07:31] <manicennui> Lot of places in Seattle have a unit on rollers with a vent you put out the window.
[00:07:45] <gwozniak> Usually at least 10 days (probably more like 20 days now) of the temperature being over 30C
[00:08:07] <gwozniak> It's usually pretty humid here
[00:08:13] <manicennui> It's more about humidity than temperature for me.
[00:08:15] <manicennui> To a point.
[00:08:27] <gwozniak> So it often feels like it's more than 30 out
[00:09:17] <gwozniak> I've lived most of my life in places without A/C
[00:09:29] <gwozniak> Only one place had it and we hardly used it
[00:09:35] <manicennui> I have never lived without AC.
[00:09:43] <manicennui> I've also never lived without central air that I can remember.
[00:10:29] <manicennui> My grandfather hated to use the AC and would wait until it was like 85F at 9PM.
[00:10:30] <gwozniak> Wait, that's not true.  Two places had it, and we used it in one of them because there were basically no windows
[00:11:07] <manicennui> I definitely think you can get used to less AC.
[00:11:32] <manicennui> Helps a lot if you are in shape too.
[00:11:37] <gwozniak> Once things get about 40C (with or without the humidex), it gets pretty hard to tolerate
[00:12:03] <gwozniak> If the temperature here is ever 35 or higher, I know I'
[00:12:09] <gwozniak> I'm in for a rough day
[00:12:27] <manicennui> Does it really hit 35C very often there?
[00:12:51] <gwozniak> With the humidex, yeah.  A fair number of days in the summer
[00:13:08] <manicennui> "On average, Chicago sees fourteen 90-degree days each year."
[00:13:12] <gwozniak> Our ceiling fans and floor fans work pretty well for us, though
[00:13:46] <manicennui> I'm also fine with being hotter outside, but I don't like sitting on a couch or something and sweating.
[00:13:52] <manicennui> Or sleeping.
[00:14:23] <manicennui> I do think there are ways we could design houses to cool better.
[00:14:31] <gwozniak> We have a ceiling fan in our bedroom and it's a godsend
[00:14:36] <manicennui> They have techniques in the Middle East.
[00:14:55] <manicennui> Create a central high point in the home that has windows at the top to suck hot air out.
[00:15:17] <manicennui> Not sure how common that design is, but there are some buildings that use it.
[00:15:43] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windcatcher
[00:15:43] <buttsbot> Windcatcher - Wikipedia
[00:17:30] <gwozniak> My dad lives in BC and when it hit 47C in the shade, he said it was pretty intolerable just to stand around
[00:17:31] <manicennui> There is a similar structure in Western architecture. I saw one on some house building show once.
[00:17:48] <manicennui> Yeah, need some wind.
[00:18:02] <manicennui> How the hell is it hitting 47C though?
[00:18:10] <manicennui> Are you sure your numbers aren't off a bit?
[00:18:26] <bkero> Nope.
[00:18:26] <gwozniak> It got that hot out there this summer.  It hit 50C somewhere
[00:18:41] <manicennui> Damn.
[00:18:41] <bkero> It got above that here in Portland, OR as well.
[00:18:48] <manicennui> Breaking 100F here isn't super common.
[00:18:53] <manicennui> Might happen once per summer.
[00:18:53] <bkero> Wherein I decided to get a 44000BTU heat pump system.
[00:18:55] <gwozniak> Thankfully his place didn't get consumed by the fires
[00:19:00] <bkero> Should be installed in February.
[00:19:32] <manicennui> "It’s been nearly nine years since the city reached an official triple-digit temp, when a high of 103 was recorded on July 6, 2012."
[00:20:15] <gwozniak> I think the heat wave out there killed over 600 people
[00:20:52] <ngoldbaum> the house i’m living in now is the first i’ve been in that’s properly sealed and insulated
[00:20:55] <manicennui> "Dating to 1871, Chicago has logged just 65 triple-digit days, with the 1988 drought summer scoring the most with seven."
[00:21:04] <ngoldbaum> makes such a big difference
[00:21:07] <gwozniak> 49.6C in Lytton was the record hit this year, I think
[00:21:50] <gwozniak> And now it's nearly -50C out there in some places
[00:22:21] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: I still just don't like the noise of central air (can be reduced by locating the unit well), and I hate cold air blowing on me, and the drying effect of the heating.
[00:22:31] <bkero> A heat wave killing 600 people
[00:22:44] <bkero> Seems so small in comparison to the summer winds that take the elderly in northern India
[00:23:45] <manicennui> One thing that sucks here is that the high/low during the summer doesn't vary enough.
[00:24:07] <manicennui> Places like Colorado seem to have closer to a 20F difference.
[00:24:11] <bkero> Now we need to start talking about wet bulb temperatures.
[00:24:20] <bkero> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature
[00:24:21] <buttsbot> Wet-bulb temperature - Wikipedia
[00:24:41] <ngoldbaum> yeah high dew point puts a floor on the temperature
[00:25:18] <gwozniak> The wildfires wiped out that town of Lytton, too.  Took it out in under an hour or something ridiculous like that
[00:25:43] <gwozniak> Yeah, wet bulb should be something we start reporting more

[00:36:38] <indigo> Yeah IRCCloud was worse

[00:45:31] <ngoldbaum> i’m paying for irccloud mostly because i like the mobile app
[00:46:47] <manicennui> I use the mobile app too.
[00:47:11] <manicennui> The only difference that I know of is that it will disconnect after a couple hours of inactivity, but I leave a tab open on my desktop and it never disconnects.
[00:47:34] <ngoldbaum> and no logs
[00:47:41] <ngoldbaum> the logs are pretty useless though
[00:47:53] <ngoldbaum> you can pretty much just export a text dump
[00:48:35] <manicennui> The reliability problems also didn't go away after their major infrastructure change a couple months ago.
[00:48:39] <manicennui> Don't remember exactly what that was.
[00:49:32] <ngoldbaum> because of the nature or IRC they can’t use cloudflare
[00:49:48] <ngoldbaum> so they need to use a specialty ISP that specializes into anti-DDOS
[00:50:01] <ngoldbaum> so of course it gets DDOS’d a lot and its network is flaky
[00:50:20] <ngoldbaum> i also think there were some ipv4/ipv6 issues too
[00:50:44] <manicennui> So weird that people still care enough to target IRC.
[00:50:51] <manicennui> And IRCCloud doesn't even run a server.

[01:10:29] <indigo> There could be an argument for not using IRC on your phone :)
[01:16:20] <manicennui> I really only use it on my phone when someone addresses me directly.
[01:18:11] <manicennui> Apparently two of the biggest music communities on the Internet were called Gear Sluts and Muff Wiggler.
[01:18:22] <manicennui> And Gear Sluts finally gave in and changed its name.
[01:18:40] <indigo> Oh wow
[01:18:57] <indigo> I used to browse their forums (gearslutz)
[01:20:06] <manicennui> One of the creators of Gearslutz is a woman.
[01:23:24] <manicennui> Muff Wiggler changed to Mod Wiggler too.
[01:24:13] <manicennui> I wonder how many more of these types of sites (special interest forums) there are out there.
[01:24:27] <manicennui> I feel like they are mostly gone for tech.
[01:25:47] <manicennui> GardenWeb still seems to exist.
[01:26:11] <manicennui> Not sure how much traffic Houzz has managed to kill.
[01:28:23] <manicennui> Someone should start a curated directory again.

[03:02:57] <dminkovsky> i think the "negative test" is a PCR and the others are going to be anti-gen

[03:07:22] <indigo> Brekkjern: What do you guys wear in the cold weather in Norway
[03:07:24] <Brekkjern> You'd have to ask one of them I think
[03:07:28] <manicennui> Wow. There is this woman on reddit who has solid black tattoo ink covering about 3/4 of her body.
[03:07:33] <Brekkjern> indigo: t-shirts and slippers
[03:07:38] <Brekkjern> I mean... It depends?
[03:07:40] <indigo> Beautiful
[03:08:19] <Brekkjern> Like, if it's -20C and I have to spend time outside I would wear completely different clothes than if it was -5C for example
[03:08:40] <indigo> What if it was 7C
[03:08:40] <Brekkjern> It also kinda depends on "when" in the winter. The earliest part feels much colder than the later part.
[03:08:47] <manicennui> I used to wear a fleece hoodie all winter in Chicago.
[03:08:51] <indigo> T-shirt and slipper weather right
[03:08:56] <manicennui> As my only outer layer.
[03:09:08] <Brekkjern> 7C is maybe sweater weather and a thin jacket
[03:09:10] <manicennui> Like I'd wear a long-sleeved shirt.
[03:09:26] <Brekkjern> Unless I have to spend a looong time outside, like hiking.
[03:10:09] <Brekkjern> The trick with cold is to wear several thinner layers, avoid sweating, and avoid cotton if possible.
[03:11:44] <indigo> Reddit says I need to spend at least $1000 on pricy brands like Patagonia and Fjallraven
[03:12:02] <indigo> Only then can I feel truly warm
[03:12:14] <Brekkjern> Absolutely
[03:14:12] <Brekkjern> There's a saying (which rhymes in Norwegian): "There is no bad weather, only bad clothes."
[03:14:46] <Brekkjern> And the most important part is to leave behind a stylish frozen corpse :P
[03:16:13] <indigo> LOL
[03:17:57] <dminkovsky> i can't imagine you need expensive clothes to feel warm in LA
[03:18:25] <dminkovsky> it's 12C right now
[03:18:52] <Brekkjern> Me neither. I've heard LA and SF can get colder than yo'd expect, but I bet a windproof jacket and a couple layers of t-shirt + sweater would do it for most days.
[03:19:48] <dminkovsky> yeah
[03:20:13] <dminkovsky> even in new york/baltimore i almost always got away with multiple layers of sweatshirts
[03:20:25] <dminkovsky> it's shlubbish but it works and costs $50
[03:20:34] <dminkovsky> for $200 i imagine you can make it look nice
[03:20:56] <dminkovsky> chicago was for real, though.
[03:22:22] <Brekkjern> I can imagine Chicago being rather cold, yeah
[03:22:39] <dminkovsky> it routinely hit -10C when i lived there
[03:23:05] <dminkovsky> and colder. but -10C was pretty normal. -5C highs
[03:23:10] <dminkovsky> it was terrible
[03:23:38] <Brekkjern> When it hits -20C and below here it is always so dry that you don't loose as much heat, so as long as it's not windy it's "fine" to walk outside with less than ideal clothes
[03:23:59] <Brekkjern> But when it's humid at the same time? Holy fuck is it cold...
[03:24:33] <Brekkjern> And the worst part is that even if it's humid outside, it's still dry as fuck inside...

[05:52:41] <dminkovsky> wow

[05:53:02] <companion_cube> y a y
[05:54:31] <companion_cube> 14-day change: +464%
[05:54:34] <dminkovsky> 17.58% in maryland. that's remarkable
[05:55:30] <dminkovsky> when i went to wegman's today it the masking was the best i've seen in the whole pandemic

[07:12:20] <companion_cube> now's the experiment indeed, and unvaccinated people are going to be fucked :/
[07:38:33] <dminkovsky> for some reason i heard the booster is max effective after 60 days? which didn't seem right
[07:38:40] <dminkovsky> i only got mine 2 weeks ago
[07:43:33] <kline> 60 days interdose, perhaps?
[07:43:50] <kline> getting a booster 5 days after your 2nd dose doesnt make sense
[07:44:08] <kline> but 8 weeks sounds about right for the delay between dose 2 and booster
[07:44:08] <gwozniak> I heard 2 weeks after the 3rd dose is when it starts to be effective
[07:46:01] <gwozniak> Which, I believe, was also the statement for the 2nd dose
[07:47:30] <companion_cube> yeah, same
[07:50:54] <dminkovsky> my second dose was in april
[07:51:56] <dminkovsky> well past 60 days

[09:00:45] <kline> its only getting worse
[09:00:54] <kline> and this is pre-christmas data, essentially
[09:01:08] <kline> since it takes a week or so to get positive tests coming back in full flow
[09:01:16] <imode> son of a bitch.
[09:01:21] <kline> so early jan expect it to be maybe 180k/day in the UK?
[09:01:34] <companion_cube> is this when we all get covid? kind of not joking
[09:01:46] <kline> pretty much
[09:02:05] <kline> and omicron appears to be different enough to evade vaccines and natural immunity
[09:02:22] <companion_cube> if we all got it within, say, 6 weeks… wouldn't it kind of disappear afterwards?
[09:02:24] <imode> I sanitize my groceries with gloves, a mask and lysol wipes.
[09:02:29] <kline> so the tradeoff for it being somewhat less serious (it appears) is that it will reinfect you anyway
[09:02:32] <imode> that's the only thing that gets into the house.
[09:02:49] <companion_cube> wow ok, you're in full isolation
[09:02:50] <kline> companion_cube, kind of, because more infections means more chances to mutate

[09:03:10] <imode> I want this SHIT TO END.
[09:03:15] <companion_cube> :/
[09:03:16] <kline> so everyone might develop immunity to omicron but other and new variants may emerge that can reinfect on account of being different enough
[09:03:23] <imode> we were THIS CLOSE to being able to go out.
[09:03:29] <imode> with masks.
[09:03:36] <imode> I need a drink.

[09:05:05] <imode> I'm so tired of this pandemic.

[09:06:12] <imode> guess it's time to hunker in for another ride..
[09:07:11] <imode> is this the thing that'll eventually push us over the cliff? is this our black plague event?
[09:07:42] <imode> I'm thankful the death toll doesn't seem to be rising.
[09:07:52] <companion_cube> it's not as deadly as the plague, thankfully
[09:08:49] <imode> I'm thankful that I can work from home, because I'd probably be dead by now if I couldn't.

[09:26:28] * manicennui dives in
[09:26:34] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: this part -- The keywords to find abusers' support communities are "estranged parents" and "grandparents' rights." -- made me laugh out loud.
[09:26:55] <hoistbypetard> i heard the term "grandparents' rights" many years ago and assumed it was exactly that
[09:26:58] <manicennui> The second page is where it gets good.
[09:28:02] <manicennui> "A grandmother who is estranged from her son's family gathers a party of six other relatives and ambushes the daughter-in-law at her house when the son is at work. The daughter-in-law refuses to let them in, so they stay on the lawn, screaming at her, for hours."
[09:28:15] <manicennui> Definitely sounds like a group of stable people that they should let back into their lives.
[09:29:29] <hoistbypetard> that surely wouldn't be a toxic relationship, for anyone.
[09:33:33] <hoistbypetard> on a very different note... the need to suddenly move a couple of my domains to a new mail host today inspired a review of some other things. including my backups. right now my backup strategy is restic -> a couple local external hard drives, one of which periodically (roughly every quarter or two) goes to live at my in-laws' house.
[09:34:21] <hoistbypetard> i was wondering if it might be worth having a copy on some cloud store somewhere, and when i went to look into mechanics, that seems straightforward
[09:34:23] <manicennui> Do they spoil it?

[09:36:47] <hoistbypetard> pricing seems anything but straightforward though... is anyone here generally backing up whole drives or large portions thereof to the cloud? and if so, care to say where and how much they extract from you for the service?
[09:41:12] <hoistbypetard> backblaze b2 seems like the cheapest reliable-looking thing i see, and at $5/TB/mo before outbound data charges, it still feels like i'd want to be selective as opposed to blasting my 6ish TB of live data up to them
[09:44:48] <hoistbypetard> (a lot, maybe 5TB of that 6TB, is stuff i don't really care about recovering. i'd only be backing it up because that's easier than being selective.)
[09:46:07] <manicennui> I have no advice. I only use about 100GB of space to back some stuff up.
[09:59:06] <hoistbypetard> if i were more organized and didn't use so many VMs, i might even get to that ballpark. i've got some digital packrat stuff going on, too, for certain.
[09:59:20] <hoistbypetard> it is astonishing how much cryptoshit is playing in this space.

[10:12:59] <hoistbypetard> proof-of-stake makes less sense, and proof-of-capacity even less.

[18:52:12] <dminkovsky> "These are the important questions."
[19:01:20] <gwozniak> I wonder if an outcome of this pandemic will be that most people will properly not equate vaccination with immunity
[19:01:55] <gwozniak> Then again, subtleties do not appear to be group knowledge's strong point
[19:02:20] <riv> I think the entire system of distributing knowledge is broken
[19:05:15] <gwozniak> I suspect speed is an enemy
[19:07:28] <manicennui> https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rqzp8a/dont_look_up_should_enrage_you/
[19:07:30] <buttsbot> Don’t Look Up Should Enrage You : antiwork
[19:07:40] <manicennui> Sounds like a good rage watch
[19:10:30] <gwozniak> I heard some reviews that said they liked the message, but the way it's delivered is so heavy-handed that you wonder why it's a movie
[19:11:02] <gwozniak> That is, it's not even parody at this point
[19:33:50] <manicennui> Many of us use humor as a coping mechanism for the absurdity of life.
[20:06:03] <gwozniak> I certainly do
[20:10:17] <ngoldbaum> i found it depressing
[20:10:32] <ngoldbaum> also come on you don’t use a telescope with the dome lights on
[20:53:06] <indigo> Speaking of depressing, I can't bring myself to watch Station Eleven
[20:53:37] <manicennui> I used to be really into depressing entertainment.
[20:53:55] <manicennui> The peak was probably Love Liza.
[20:54:31] <manicennui> Wilson Joel's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wife Liza (Annie Morgan) has, for an unexplained reason, committed suicide. Wilson one night discovers a sealed letter from his wife, which he believes to be her suicide note. In his grief-stricken state and with the added stress of finding the letter, which he cannot bring himself to open and read, he forms an addiction to inhaling gasoline fumes ("huffing").
[20:55:44] <ngoldbaum> synecdoche new york is the most depressing movie ever
[20:55:50] <ngoldbaum> maybe meloncholia
[20:56:00] <manicennui> Dancer in the Dark is pretty depressing too.
[20:56:06] <ngoldbaum> also come on adam mckay someone already made a depressing impact movie
[20:59:28] <manicennui> hah
[20:59:34] <manicennui> I just remembered Manchester by the Sea.
[20:59:53] <manicennui> I went to see it with a couple of coworkers, and another coworker gave us shit about it forever.
[21:00:14] <manicennui> It was a really good movie, but depressing, and I'm not sure why anyone should watch it.
[21:00:59] <manicennui> Tom Segura and his wife refer to them as white bummers.
[21:01:17] <manicennui> Depressing movies that white yuppies like to watch.

[22:20:14] <indigo> Darn, one of my coworker's roommates got covid
[22:20:24] <indigo> I feel like this time it is particularly virulent

[22:33:22] <buttsbot> Apple aims to prevent defections with $180,000 bonuses - Los Angeles Times
[22:34:10] <imode> damn. amazon, take a cue.
[22:34:49] <manicennui> Always annoying to me that my employer thinks we are hiring top talent, but also doesn't think that they are competing with the companies who actually hire top talent.
[22:34:51] <indigo> Amazon doesn't try to save you if you leave?
[22:35:06] <imode> bahahaha.
[22:35:08] <imode> no.
[22:35:09] <manicennui> My employer also talks about people leaving for companies like Amazon as something good on their part.
[22:35:30] <imode> indigo: if you want to leave, you leave.
[22:35:36] <manicennui> Like it proves that we are great too somehow.
[22:35:51] <indigo> imode: They don't even ask "is there anything we can do to keep you"
[22:36:04] <imode> from what I have heard, no.
[22:37:58] <manicennui> I know we have tried to offer things to get people to stay, but it is nothing that would consider most people to stay.
[22:38:09] <imode> if you're leaving you already hate it here.
[22:38:42] <imode> or you found a better offer.
[22:38:50] <manicennui> Actually we had a guy leave because my employer resisted allowing people to be permanently remote, so he applied elsewhere just to see what would happen and got a great offer.
[22:39:10] <manicennui> Then my employer changed their policy before he left but after he gave notice.
[22:39:19] <manicennui> But he was actually happy otherwise.
[22:39:29] <manicennui> Wasn't going to pass up far more pay though.
[22:39:48] <manicennui> Also, they still make people "apply" to be permanently remote.
[22:39:51] <manicennui> So it isn't a sure thing.
[22:40:36] <manicennui> It's hilarious watching companies act like we are still in the 80s or something.
[22:40:43] <indigo> imode: It's still a nice gesture
[22:40:44] <manicennui> And suffering the consequences of their actions.
[22:41:41] <imode> indigo: it is.. but it's not one that's common.
