[00:11:54] <int0x1C8> welp had to revert the exchange migration
[00:12:10] <cryptic1> what did you do wrong?
[00:12:37] <int0x1C8> too many people complained their phones email wasn't working even though we're technically closed this week
[00:13:06] <CptLuxx> why wasnt there phone email not working?
[00:13:13] <CptLuxx> its an exchange migration... that should still work
[00:13:37] <int0x1C8> I dunno, when I configured everything for mail flow to go through the new 2016, the active sync endpoint needed to be mapped to that
[00:13:57] <CptLuxx> and? the fqdn where the phones connect to doesnt change
[00:14:06] <int0x1C8> once I migrated my mailbox, it started working again, but then outlook couldn't connect
[00:15:05] <int0x1C8> when redirecting do you have to set the externalurl for all virtual directories to $null?
[00:15:27] <CptLuxx> uff
[00:15:31] <int0x1C8> the guide I was following said to do that, then set them to the fqdn on the 2016 one
[00:17:09] <int0x1C8> meh, the next 2 days I don't have to care about anyone complaining, I can keep troubleshooting until its done, or just migrate everyone's mailboxes
[00:17:24] <int0x1C8> just have to figure out why outlook can't autoconfigure like it used to

[00:18:17] <int0x1C8> I want to, been working on and planning this shit for the past month
[00:18:18] <CptLuxx> because your autodiscover url is now wrong i guess..
[00:19:27] <int0x1C8> autodiscover dns was set to new server, but I did run a ps command to change the new server's autodiscover SCP from hostname.domain.com/blah to autodiscover.domain.com/blah
[00:19:48] <int0x1C8> that endpoint is set to hostname in the 2010 environment
[00:21:19] <int0x1C8> I used the Set-ClientAccessService -AutodiscoverServiceInternalURI
[00:35:16] <int0x1C8> I'm exchange'd out for today though, deal with it agian tomorrow from home with a bottle of glenfiddich 12

[11:12:30] <CableNinja> you had to use the force of everything in your soul to do it, so it just bounced when I did it, but the cap *did* come off. the bounce caused the corner to puncture the can, and it started sprayin everything.

[20:41:37] <csplinter> I have a Conner Peripherals cp-3411 hard drive (circa 1990) that I want to access for nostalgia sake. My first attempt was a usb-ide controller connected an ubuntu vm, but I had trouble connecting the device to the vm. I was able to connect it to a windows 10 host, so I gave it a go. The device ID read out into windows as something like "oCnner ePeriephpherals." It wouldn't read of course. Later I connected 
[20:41:37] <csplinter> it to a different usb-ide controller and managed to attach it to a vm, but the blocks couldn't be read. Is the controller screwed? Any advice?
