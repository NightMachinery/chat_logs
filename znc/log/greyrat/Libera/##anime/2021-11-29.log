[07:15:00] <amigojapan> MootPoot: not exactly
[07:15:36] <amigojapan> MootPoot: recently they are charging money for plastic bags at shops
[07:15:42] <MootPoot> its a tax that taxes things depending on how much carbon is emitted while producing them or recycling them , and uses the money to subsidize things like solar panels 
[07:15:43] <amigojapan> Here
[07:15:47] <MootPoot> or recyling
[07:16:21] <MootPoot> so it makes things which are resource intensive/polluting more expensive, discouraaging their use

[07:20:22] <MootPoot> if you want an incentive to change to things that last longer, you might have to settle to have a subscription for everything
[07:20:45] <JesseDesu> you need a subscription for your pp

[07:24:17] <MootPoot> maybe - depends if the phone is worth the price

[07:24:46] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: Low Power DDR4
[07:25:10] <amigojapan> I would pay up to 50 dollars more for the option of Chargeable battery
[07:25:56] <JesseDesu> low power for efficiency?
[07:26:09] <JesseDesu> or low power nerfed
[07:26:24] <amigojapan> MootPoot: sharp is currently charging 40usd to change the battery
[07:26:39] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: both
[07:27:15] <MootPoot> It dosent perform as well as desktop ddr4 but if it did your phone would last like 4 hours on a charge

[08:33:27] <Nanobot> Most likely, YouTube killed a ton of their subscriptions, because those channels have tons of subscribers and no content yet. It's fun to know that YouTube either lies about subscriber numbers or actively unsubscribes people from channels they're subscribed to. Or possibly even bans their accounts.
[08:33:57] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: speakers have not changed that much over time
[08:34:15] <JesseDesu> they're still really good
[08:34:28] <Nanobot> YouTube is a great example of the limits of current AI technology. YouTube relies on AI for things that AI is completely and utterly incompetent at.

[10:17:14] <omero> I might faint or have seizures just by watching a pic on a browser
[10:17:24] <tcsilver> :----) ... be safe guys... avoid covid and the new variants
[10:17:36] <omero> animated gifs are especially dangerous to me
[10:17:47] <JesseDesu> be safe
[10:17:48] <zoidberg> omero: I forgot the name of condition, there is another interesting condition where people see colors when music is played. Synesthotheia or something
[10:18:01] <omero> yes, sinestesia
[10:18:25] <omero> its usually caused by some brain condition (a very bad condition)
[10:18:35] <omero> but it can be congenital... and very rare
[10:18:40] <tcsilver> I will :---D , thanks JesseDesu! .. make sure all of your family and friends are healthy guys :) ... I can't say this enough!
[10:18:40] <omero> very very rare
[10:19:07] <tcsilver> still don't know what happened to fenderbassist :<
[10:19:43] <zoidberg> why? what happened to Fenpai?
[10:19:53] <zoidberg> He's probably busy.
[10:20:07] <zoidberg> !seen fenderbassist
[10:20:07] <ImoutoBot> zoidberg: fenderbassist was last seen in ##anime 3 months and 22 days ago: <Fenderbassist> (hi amigojapan  emmeka)
[10:20:23] <JesseDesu> cant spell fenderbassist without assist
[10:21:03] <omero> MootPoot: in my case the problem cannot be compensated by glasses of any kind
[10:21:57] <zoidberg> yeah, it's not something that can be corrected

[10:22:58] <zoidberg> the cones or cone cells are the issue from what I understand, is that right omero?

[10:23:24] <omero> Im seeing like 3 of those areas
[10:23:48] <JesseDesu> i'm an artist and i dont use those color names
[10:23:51] <omero> I know because the names make no sense to me... on both sides :)
[10:24:05] <JesseDesu> i think in terms of HSB sliders
[10:24:07] <omero> just look at the colors in the circles
[10:24:11] <omero> forget the names
[10:24:25] <omero> I dont see any difference in most cases

[10:25:46] <omero> yeah, the problem is my retina sensors are quite... impaired, JesseDesu :)
[10:25:59] <omero> it cannot be corrected/retrofitted :P
[10:26:41] <omero> its because a certain 'receptor' that is supposed to be like | is instead like /
[10:26:53] <JesseDesu> i rarely use the color sampler to extract color data
[10:27:36] <JesseDesu> colors are like music
[10:27:50] <omero> btw, my eyes seem to be working in a catlike manner :)
[10:27:56] <JesseDesu> its got frequencies, can be tuned by comparison
[10:28:03] <JesseDesu> and harmonies
[10:28:30] <omero> the fun part is that I never realized I had a "problem"
[10:28:58] <omero> untill one day at school, the teacher noticed me drawing trees in a weird manner 
[10:29:14] <omero> I was very very young back then :)
[10:29:36] <JesseDesu> i started wearing glasses in 3rd grade
[10:29:46] <JesseDesu> i was traumatized by the name calling

[10:31:18] <zoidberg> kids, adults, old people, everyone is the same, they all suck in different ways
[10:31:19] <JesseDesu> 3rd grade is when kinda when they start realizing some people are cooler than others

[10:41:43] <omero> that .jpg was a even a preliminary version... cant remember where that was posted originally
[10:42:43] <JesseDesu> got that thick maxim magazine body type
[10:42:58] <Macer> so i finished dies irae 
[10:43:02] <Macer> and it was very build-a-penis
[10:43:11] <omero> and the word megane lead me to investigate 'megane no megami' 
[10:43:35] <omero> I know I know... but I was curious :)
[10:45:08] <Macer> you mean anime body type?
[10:45:23] <Macer> i mean it isn't like anime is lacking thic big breasted women as main characters
[10:45:36] <JesseDesu> even homeless people in san francisco have iphones
[10:45:41] <JesseDesu> maybe not the latest
[10:45:47] <MootPoot> Banana penis
[10:45:48] <JesseDesu> but probably 8 or 9
[10:45:53] <Macer> are they still called obamaphones?
[10:46:22] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: smartphones are a absolute must now to get around and do stuff
[10:46:45] <MootPoot> If anything it's a luxury now to be able to get by without one
[10:47:09] <Macer> no way. you can easily live life without one
[10:47:22] <Macer> old people still use flip phones :P 
[10:47:31] <JesseDesu> you need to know how to read a paper map
[10:47:37] <JesseDesu> kids dont know how these days
[10:47:50] <Macer> why? lots of kids are in urban areas where you just know how to get around
[10:48:05] <MootPoot> Macer: old people have the money to be able to not use public transit or be worried about your next meal
[10:48:11] <MootPoot> My point exactly
[10:48:31] <JesseDesu> pointed penis
[10:48:32] <MootPoot> If you can get by without one, chances are you're better off then normal
[10:48:34] <Macer> plenty of old people take public transit with their flip phones and coins
[10:48:34] <JesseDesu> 8======>
[10:48:45] <Macer> THAN
[10:48:47] <Macer> lol
[10:48:59] <MootPoot> Macer: in my country they got rid of cash payments for buses
[10:49:03] <JesseDesu> than
[10:49:11] <MootPoot> And no more paper bus maps
[10:49:17] <MootPoot> What then?
[10:49:24] <omero> who need maps or a gps navigator? I am a man. I wont even ask for directions... 
[10:49:39] <Macer> MootPoot: they still use cards which can be purchased from machines or called for
[10:49:49] <Macer> from their flip phones
[10:49:51] <Macer> lol
[10:49:57] <JesseDesu> if you're a man 
[10:50:02] <JesseDesu> better to dead reckon
[10:50:18] <omero> Am I lost? nope. Im just having a panoramic detour!
[10:50:27] <Macer> i think socially we have translated "want" into "need"
[10:50:31] <MootPoot> Macer: which country are you talking about
[10:50:35] <Macer> people just want to do things faster heh
[10:50:38] <MootPoot> In this case
[10:50:54] <Macer> but to say it is a necessity is a bit of a stretch
[10:51:00] <MootPoot> To me it just comes across as extremely out of touch
[10:51:13] <JesseDesu> wut cuntry
[10:51:39] <MootPoot> Like if he's talking about places where low tech is still the meta, then I can see
[10:51:43] <MootPoot> Eastern Europe
[10:51:47] <MootPoot> Etc
[10:51:55] <Macer> the US 
[10:51:57] <Macer> heh
[10:52:01] <MootPoot> But in any NA city?
[10:52:06] <MootPoot> Yeah no
[10:52:28] <Macer> i live in chicago. i see old people on the train using flip phones all the time
[10:52:31] <Macer> they seem to manage
[10:52:47] <MootPoot> Old people have homes and their kids to help them with things
[10:52:49] <Macer> with their grocery bag cart and checkbooks
[10:52:53] <JesseDesu> i use a cup and string to communicate
[10:52:56] <Macer> not all of them
[10:53:01] <omero> Macer: chicago... does Pier 34 still exist?
[10:53:05] <Nanobot> When IRyS graduates, she will become alumnIRyS.
[10:53:06] <Macer> some just live lonley lives waiting for death :)
[10:53:32] <Macer> omero: huh? you mean navy pier?
[10:53:34] <JesseDesu> i thought i saw a nanobot joke somewhere
[10:53:41] <JesseDesu> where is it
[10:53:49] <JesseDesu> i need to grep the log
[10:53:56] <MootPoot> If they can afford to live alone like that, that already means they're financially well off- living alone is expensive
[10:54:24] <Macer> i guess social security and medicare can be considered "well off" 
[10:54:24] <Macer> heh
[10:54:34] <MootPoot> Compared to homeless?
[10:54:36] <MootPoot> Yes
[10:54:37] <Macer> i mean at that point in your life you shouldn't be paying mortgage anymore anyways
[10:54:40] <omero> macer was a club in chicago that I went almost every night... they had live music performers
[10:54:43] <MootPoot> Absolutely it is
[10:54:55] <omero> I even met eric clapton there (he was a regular)
[10:55:05] <JesseDesu> slow hand
[10:55:05] <Macer> MootPoot: the cure for homelessness is being able to use pornhub from an iphone? :)
[10:55:14] <MootPoot> ....
[10:55:26] <MootPoot> I can't tell if you're being retarded on purpose
[10:55:28] <MootPoot> Or not
[10:55:36] <Macer> i mean... needing food is prorbably more of a priority isn't it? 
[10:55:42] <omero> not sure about the 34 in the name... but it certainly had Pier in it
[10:55:58] <Macer> omero: can't say i ever heard of it
[10:56:00] <JesseDesu> san francisco has a famous pier 39
[10:56:09] <omero> was many years ago that I lived in chicago for a while

[11:04:17] <Macer> is there supposed to be an episode 18? it seems like it ended at 17 with an ona or something
[11:04:21] <Macer> a prequel i'm guessing
[11:04:41] <Nanobot> I pranked my little sister with a fake medical report saying that her body will gradually transform into a male's unless she undergoes a treatment involving cryogenically freezing her for a year. I did everything I could to make her as scared as possible, so she was pretty much bawling her eyes out as the freezing began. But it'll be so worth it a year from now when we can hopefully revive her and I tell her she was the first patient to survive

[12:40:42] <JesseDesu> do they sort them by brand
[12:40:48] <KatrinValerie> here in Germany we burn most plastic trash

[12:40:55] <JesseDesu> and give it back to the respective companys

[12:41:01] <DunceCotus> you could burn it all but yeah, it would raise temperatures by 5 degrees over a decade and sea levels would rise like 10 km

[12:41:20] <DunceCotus> we'd get over it after a few decades/centuries
[12:41:20] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu: those are usually single use bottles
[12:41:43] <DunceCotus> and the 2020s becomes a kind of dark ages
[12:41:49] <KatrinValerie> They just put the glass into recycling 
[12:41:55] <omero> there are processing plants to convert even the most resilient tires
[12:42:02] <JesseDesu> do they melt down the beer bottles 
[12:42:08] <KatrinValerie> would be too much effort and a waste of resources to get these back to the brewing company
[12:42:14] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu: I think so, yes
[12:42:15] <DunceCotus> the question is not can it be done but how much it costs to do it
[12:42:18] <omero> but some gang insist on necklacing their foes
[12:42:22] <DunceCotus> and who foots the bill
[12:42:29] <DunceCotus> private corps don't want to bother, its not profitable
[12:42:43] <DunceCotus> and every thing is getting privatized so govts don't want to do it eithr
[12:43:10] <KatrinValerie> Idk maybe abolish capitalism and just cooperate solving this issue without the matters of money
[12:43:13] <JesseDesu> seems enourmously wasteful to melt recycled glass
[12:43:30] <DunceCotus> single-use glass
[12:43:35] <DunceCotus> seems safe
[12:43:36] <omero> glass is actually one of the most recyclable stuff around
[12:43:43] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu: it's usually first ground down and molten later on
[12:43:58] <JesseDesu> all of that takes power and fuel
[12:44:07] <KatrinValerie> so they don't directly melt the beer bottles
[12:44:10] <DunceCotus> power generation is a big issue yes
[12:44:16] <KatrinValerie> who ever gets the recycled glass pellets does
[12:44:33] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: right, division of labour
[12:45:15] <KatrinValerie> Like, idk why we can't just sit down and solve the power problem once and for all
[12:45:26] <KatrinValerie> We do not need any freaking new tech to solve this issue

[13:02:33] <omero> ah... that was not nice
[13:03:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: look at the clothing particularly school uniforms, look at their media, a lot of battles and violence in their anime and manga etc.
[13:03:31] <DunceCotus> look at their food, its all in small packages that one could see as perfect for food rations on a battlefield
[13:03:46] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: a number of factors
[13:04:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Japan is not the only country that uses school uniforms
[13:04:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I meant like how female uniforms look like Navy
[13:04:50] <DunceCotus> and male uniforms are often quite like an army lieutenant or something
[13:05:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there's a naval warfare kinda vibe to japan, which I think makes sense
[13:05:25] <Sapphirus> I wore a uniform to school and I'm not from Japan. lol
[13:05:51] <DunceCotus> well I am not saying just the fact they have school uniforms
[13:05:57] <DunceCotus> but rather the style of uniforms
[13:06:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sailor uniforms were imitated from the UK
[13:06:43] <Sapphirus> Style is similar in the UK
[13:07:36] <DunceCotus> I'm not sure if it is
[13:07:41] <DunceCotus> I haven't seen that style in the UK
[13:07:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: some schools have dropped sailor uniforms all together
[13:08:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sure, that's also happening
[13:08:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in the UK it's for boys
[13:08:16] <DunceCotus> no?

[15:30:27] <omero> and couldnt be proved until several centuries later
[15:30:36] <omero> with a proper math explanation
[15:30:45] <amigojapan> I see
[15:31:16] <omero> the ditz just 'got it in his head' in a very short time
[15:31:31] <omero> call it an intuition
[15:31:58] <omero> if you challenged the intuition, you would find that 'its right, every single time'
[15:32:46] <omero> but the accademic mathematical explanation (with numbers and formulae) eluded being written down for the accademics to enjoy
[15:33:23] <amigojapan> omero: I want someone to solve the problem of "who shaves the barber
[15:33:42] <omero> it resisted even being procedurally bruteforced (for a while)
[15:34:33] <omero> because (thanks the heavens)... we still lack that 
[15:34:43] <omero> that AI ;)
[15:35:26] <omero> I was interested in developing AIs... it was one of the things that lured me into programming
[15:35:44] <omero> coding... devising ways to solve problems
[15:36:11] <omero> I abandoned entierely that field.
[15:36:20] <omero> I became ... uneasy
[15:36:27] <omero> with the whole concept
[15:36:43] <amigojapan> omero: but does it really make sense that some infinities are bigger than others? Even if they have double the items they both have infinite items so they seem the same size to me
[15:36:56] <omero> I know... I might have grown... a little paranoid over the ages
[15:37:57] <omero> amigojapan: that question has been debated too ... in the middle ages. even before computer or any powerful calculus devices existed
[15:38:45] <omero> its known as the 'how many angels can dance on the top of a pin head'

[15:41:10] <omero> this is when I thank the heavens that we havent reached the point where AI collapses into an event
[15:41:15] <DPA> It does make sense for infinities to have different sizes, in terms of mathematics. The test for this is to see, if every element inn one infinity can be transformed to every element in another infinity.
[15:41:58] * omero just screams aloud: AWWWWWWWW

[16:33:10] <JesseDesu> and you pour the grinds without the paper filter
[16:33:35] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: no, how to make coffee is a core part of my self
[16:33:42] <JesseDesu> well i have
[16:33:52] <TsundereNoises> the ability to make coffee awakens before the ability to stumble further than the coffee

[16:38:11] <TsundereNoises> I think that's a bit unfair, there was quite a bit of plot to it
[16:38:32] <TsundereNoises> and I thought of the redhead as the more main of the two protagonists

[17:21:18] <Satin> i see i see

[17:21:40] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I kind of am a book hoarder, but I also reference a lot of them, non-fiction I like to look back at a lot at weird times, and short stories/poetry I often just want one at a time, rather than reading the whole book

[17:23:32] <TsundereNoises> Satin: Lucky Star has a special place in my heart, it's probably what made me the weeb I am today (and at the same time, I love it but I'm not sure I can just recommend it to everyone, it's very reference-based, and many of those are dated at this point)
[17:23:44] <TsundereNoises> but there's more than just references, it's not anime family guy

[17:27:35] <Satin> or have a location near u?

[17:42:18] <Satin> To me, you don't want to blindly quote (or follow) someone else's view just because they're well esteemed and said so, on the other hand, one person can't come up with unique or informed perspectives, and it's nice to give credit where it's due as long as you're synthesizing it, and not just parroting it.

[18:00:15] <JesseDesu> i almost took photography as a major, but i had this weird logic that if you love it you'll get bored if you make it your job, so i chose my second favorite at the time which was drawing
[18:00:17] <Cryowolf> it captures sound from 4 different microphones to create 5.1 sound
[18:00:20] <Cryowolf> real 5.1

[18:01:38] <JesseDesu> in the end i think drawing is more sought after skill 
[18:02:05] <Cryowolf> I'd disagree
[18:02:05] *** Joins: nuke (nuke@nuke.pt)
[18:02:41] <amigojapan> Drawing is definitely harder skill to aquire
[18:02:50] <Cryowolf> photography has a lot of fields where it's useful and learning different things like cinematography, videography etc to complement your skills makes you more sought out
[18:02:53] <JesseDesu> thats what i meant
[18:03:27] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, I dunno if I'd agree with that. Drawing certainly requires a lot more innate talent to break the threshold
[18:03:40] <JesseDesu> in terms of rare talent
[18:04:03] <Cryowolf> being good at taking photos and such also requires talent in order to find the image
[18:04:09] <Cryowolf> you can be technically good
[18:04:15] <Cryowolf> but that doesn't mean you'll take good phjotos
[18:04:17] <Cryowolf> photos
[18:05:19] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the fact is that I can at least take rudimentary photos with my phone, but I can't draw to save my life

[18:06:50] <JesseDesu> michael collins drew the apollo 11 patch in his spare minutes of flight
[18:06:50] <Cryowolf> eh taking photos with a phone and learning every skill needed to operate a camera, set up light, understand hoiw aperture, shutter speeds and everything works into the picture you're trying to take is quite different from lettingg a camera use autosettings that usually end up taking very similar setting pictures
[18:06:53] <Cryowolf> that are beutiful yes
[18:07:11] <Cryowolf> but it's not really a skill set that equals using a camera
[18:07:40] <Cryowolf> knowing which lens to use, how to position the light or control it using reflection or diffusing
[18:08:33] <Sadale> too much work lol just use automode already \o/
[18:08:47] <JesseDesu> i use the P mode on mine most of the time
[18:08:58] <JesseDesu> if i want good lighting i just get more lamps
[18:09:11] <JesseDesu> its not hard
[18:09:26] <Cryowolf> still though I'll agree that drawing requires more innate talent to be combined with multiple skill sets. You need to see the picture in your head, you need to know how to translate this to paper, you need the hand-eye coordination to do it, you need  a stable enough hand, you need to understand which pencil does what (digital or not)
[18:09:28] <Cryowolf> and so on
[18:09:43] <Cryowolf> JesseDesu, it's not about just pointing more lights at something
[18:10:22] <Cryowolf> if you want the shadow to cast a certain way and the light to bounce off differently and cast in a very specific manner. You need to know how to manipulate the light down to the smallest detail
[18:10:31] <Cryowolf> and there's more to it than "more lights"
[18:10:45] <Cryowolf> and certainly something that I never learned very well
[18:10:46] <amigojapan> cryowolf this is one of the better photos I took using my phone recently https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CzLfBiDJ/IMG_20211102_161012233_20211102_161014761_20211102_174203846.jpg

[19:11:15] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, What MootPoot said gave me an idea tho. I could convert my IoT clock into a watch by slapping a couple of AAA batteries onto that and put a wristband onto that :3
[19:11:29] <ButterNoodle> aaa's are large
[19:11:31] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: sounds bulky
[19:11:33] <ButterNoodle> pill battery?
[19:11:37] <Sadale> It's a joke.
[19:11:40] <Sadale> A joke product
[19:11:45] <ButterNoodle> 1850?
[19:11:59] <Sadale> Not sure if it can output enough current for my clock.
[19:12:19] <Sadale> mine's rather power-hungry./
[19:13:23] <Sadale> I think it takes like 30mA idle. And the peak current is quite something. Maybe like up to 500mA~1A

[20:32:46] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u just gotta drink good coffee to enjoy ブラク
[20:32:58] <MootPoot> I mostly take with chream
[20:33:00] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: yes
[20:33:02] <MootPoot> cream
[20:33:08] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: yes.. city light is about as far as I go
[20:33:09] <MootPoot> pass on the sugar tho
[20:33:17] <ButterNoodle> u do 1/2 and 1/2
[20:33:19] <MootPoot> although light is a pain to find
[20:33:20] <TsundereNoises> yeah sugar ruins perfectly good coffee
[20:33:29] <ButterNoodle> on keto u should do the heavy whipping cream for the fat
[20:33:41] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: smaller coffee roasters often have a lot of light roasts, some of the ones I like have more of that than anything else
[20:33:47] <TsundereNoises> it's the big ones that do dark roasts all the time
[20:33:47] <MootPoot> so ButterNoodle nah more  like 80-20 , 20% being cream/milk
[20:34:07] <TsundereNoises> depending on the coffee and time of day I do like a splash of milk in coffee
[20:34:13] <TsundereNoises> but sugar ruins it
[20:34:25] <psyomn> hahaha I love your nick
