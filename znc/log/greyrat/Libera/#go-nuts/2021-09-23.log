[02:55:55] <Seirdy> dostoyevsky2: fuzz testing is indirectly useful for testing code correctness since it also reveals new code paths.
[02:56:45] <Seirdy> i like to think of extensive property testing as "bytecode fuzz testing".
[02:58:00] <Tv_> dostoyevsky2: how much would you have to type to match https://github.com/tv42/humanize-bytes/blob/master/cmd/bytes2human/cram/bytes2human.t ?
[02:58:24] <Tv_> dostoyevsky2: fuzz testing is unrelated to races, as such (though it might trigger races, too)
[02:58:44] <Tv_> dostoyevsky2: you can still have undesirable behavior such as panics, in Go
[02:58:54] <Seirdy> Fuzz testing is inherently related to almost every other type of testing since the whole point is finding every edge case possible.

[06:18:48] <zsnes> Depends on how you're deploying it...I generally use environment variables/config file with ECS/EC2 deployments
[06:20:23] <zsnes> using a json config file you can just parse into a struct is always nice

[06:24:00] <Xionkana> This is ultimately going to become a Kubernetes stack, so environment variables was my leaning. It just feels like bad practice to put essentially a feature flag into an environment variable?
[06:24:22] <Xionkana> Probably not worth over-rotating on either, I suppose.

[13:50:38] <CoolerX> Hi
[13:51:06] <CoolerX> I have a program with 2 threads, on the main thread I am doing a long running operation, and on the other thread I have a HTTP REST server
[13:51:31] <CoolerX> They share an integer variable which I am incrementing from the main thread as the long running operation progresses
[13:51:48] <CoolerX> in the server thread I am reading that integer value and returning it when a request comes
[13:52:25] *** Joins: bomb_ (~bomb@user/bomb)
[13:52:56] <CoolerX> I am not using any locks or atomic counters
[13:53:22] <CoolerX> Is there a chance that it can panic?
[13:53:59] <albertito> CoolerX: there's a chance that you return a corrupted/invalid integer value, because the access is racy
[13:54:43] <albertito> CoolerX: if you write the variable from one goroutine and read it from another, you need locks or an atomic counter
[13:54:48] <CoolerX> albertito, sure that's fine
[13:54:58] <CoolerX> the value doesn't have to be accurate
[13:55:44] <albertito> CoolerX: it's not an accuracy thing, you might get values that are neither the "old" or the "new" value, but some random crap
[13:55:45] <sztanpet> the behavior of data race is undefined, its not just "not accurate"
[13:56:11] <CoolerX> albertito, sure
[13:56:14] <CoolerX> that's fine as well
[13:56:15] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[13:56:34] <sztanpet> its not fine, that means you dont actually care what the value is, so why even have it in the code
[13:56:40] <albertito> CoolerX: so you don't care that instead of 11 or 12 you return 30495834059384059 ?
[13:57:13] <CoolerX> yes that's fine
[13:57:14] <albertito> CoolerX: I guess in that situation it's fine, but I would put a really large comment
[13:57:24] <CoolerX> I am asking if it can panic
[13:57:30] <albertito> CoolerX: also if the variable is part of a struct, you might also see other weirdness around it
[13:57:43] <CoolerX> I don't want it to panic because one thread is reading from it while another is writing to the integer
[13:58:04] <CoolerX> albertito, no it's just an integer
[13:58:20] <albertito> but no, I don't think it will panic. you might get bad data, some funkyness with cache lines on special cases, but it shouldn't panic
[13:58:23] <CoolerX> is there a chance it can panic? do you know?
[13:58:27] <CoolerX> ok
[13:58:40] <CoolerX> Is there some docs regarding this?
[13:58:45] <CoolerX> maybe in the golang reference?
[13:58:53] <albertito> don't quote me on it, it is fairly tricky behaviour to model
[13:59:08] <CoolerX> I think it just says the behaviour is undefined, looking at some stackoverflow threads
[13:59:25] <CoolerX> not sure if they mean it can panic as well
[14:00:02] <fizzie> If there *is* documentation, it would likely be in the memory model doc, which starts with this: "If you must read the rest of this document to understand the behavior of your program, you are being too clever." But it's at https://golang.org/ref/mem anyway.
[14:01:35] <fizzie> (Guessing there isn't, though.)
[14:01:42] <sztanpet> CoolerX you have two options, either read the variable properly (with mutual exclusion), or dont read it at all
[14:01:43] <CoolerX> fizzie, I just want some progress report from the long running operation
[14:01:52] <CoolerX> I don''t want to slow it down with an atomic counter
[14:01:58] <sztanpet> you might think "its okay", its not
[14:02:06] <CoolerX> I don't really care about the value being valid or accurate
[14:02:13] <sztanpet> so dont read the value
[14:02:25] <CoolerX> sztanpet, the only way it is not ok is if it panics or otherwise interrupts the long running operation
[14:02:29] <CoolerX> otherwise I don't care
[14:03:31] <albertito> CoolerX: if it's a long-running operation, an atomic counter won't really make much difference, and then you can not worry about this at all
[14:04:06] <CoolerX> albertito, worry about what?
[14:04:13] <CoolerX> are you saying it will panic?
[14:04:18] <albertito> CoolerX: I have seen cases where people avoided the atomicity for performance, I understand it is a valid case. But it's quite rare, I wouldn't worry about it if you have both a long running op and an http server involved
[14:04:35] <albertito> CoolerX: no, I'm saying that the performance difference of an atomic will be completely unnoticeable
[14:04:47] <albertito> CoolerX: and then you will know you're safe from any weirdness
[14:04:48] <CoolerX> why do I need that complexity anyway?
[14:04:53] <CoolerX> the code is simple now
[14:05:02] <albertito> CoolerX: because the side-effects are fairly unpredictable
[14:05:04] <CoolerX> myFoo++
[14:05:20] <sztanpet> because the code is incorrect, you cannot reason about the code
[14:05:25] <CoolerX> albertito, so you are saying the sideeffects includes panics?
[14:06:15] <CoolerX> fizzie, mentioned a memory model
[14:06:22] <CoolerX> does it say anything about panics
[14:06:25] <CoolerX> ?

[15:08:36] <pinky> so for alpine i guess people just enable glibc compat?
[15:08:55] <siXy> Most people use the alpine-glibc image instead of the default one, yeah
[15:09:18] <pinky> oh but then all of the alpine binaries are using glibc? :(

[15:10:54] <pinky> so its only my go binary i care about

[15:24:22] <siXy> I have seen the fallout from people attempting to use musl, though. Lots of times. It's never pretty.
[15:24:30] <pinky> even recently?

[15:25:18] <siXy> pinky: yeah musl hasn't suddenly started being a sensible glibc, it still deliberately breaks important functionality, and the lies about it.
[15:25:50] <pinky> :(
[15:26:47] <siXy> but for go specifically it's generally not a huge deal - lots of projects have no need for cgo whatsoever.

[18:39:29] <Tv_> siXy: ah https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2016/03/01/5
[18:39:43] <siXy> musl replaces it with an empty stub, so it LOOKS like it's supported, and can't be detected at compile time, so quite hard to work around.
[18:40:49] <Tv_> https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/buildroot/patch/c9b7162513ee169da4b9e7e73d66288c083e4a7a.camel@gmail.com/
[18:41:37] <Tv_> siXy: the openwall link says to "just" use pthread_setschedparam
[18:42:02] <siXy> Mmm. Lemme just rebuild half the world to do that.
[18:43:41] <Tv_> this does look like one of those cases where "glibc has compat with *their own bad decisions*" (even if linux kinda set them a trap)
[18:46:50] <siXy> I don't think that's right - the musl author conviently ignores that functioning according to his holy posix bible would be idiotic as the scheduler works with threads, not pids, and calling setscheduler at the PID level of granularity would be obviously silly
[18:47:02] <Tv_> hooray timing-dependent browser test that fail about 1 run in 100
[18:47:44] <siXy> it's not a bad glibc decision - it's the kernel doing the only sensible thing when given a posix api that doesn't make any sense
[18:47:44] <Tv_> siXy: i think what you're saying is that the posix api isn't good enough to control what you might want to control. sure, then that functionality should be exposed with a different name.
[18:48:33] <siXy> If linux was determined to be 100% pure posix compatible, perhaps but it isn't and never really has
[18:48:55] <Tv_> making a libc that has posix functions that aren't posix compatible sounds like a bad idea to me
[18:49:06] <Tv_> i'm 100% ok with linux-specific apis
[18:50:18] <siXy> the thing that really pisses me off though is that if the author of musl wasn't such a fantastic pain in the ass to work with, they'd simply leave that API out of their libc if they really can't cope with s/pid/thread/ on one platform. But replacing it with a stub that returns a runtime error is just being a jerk.
