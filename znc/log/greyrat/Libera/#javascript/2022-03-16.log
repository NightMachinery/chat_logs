[00:01:15] <austincheney> Brewster, the typescript rule for a property whose value is a certain object or an array of that object would look like:     mySpecialInterface | mySpecialInterface[]
[00:01:42] <Brewster> internet explorer, is that you?
[00:01:45] <Brewster> just kidding
[00:01:52] <Brewster> I actually figured out that part
[00:02:00] <Brewster> it was the schema I was struggling with

[00:27:22] <NinjaKirby> I sometimes still struggle with basic array methods, sometimes it's just messing up the logic, but I tend to write using the second format I've linked to, and here it just doesn't work. I dare not imagine how much time I've lost just because I'm writing array methods incorrectly.

[00:28:45] <DPA> In a function, "this" is set when it's called. In this case, to undefined, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex
[00:28:45] <DPA> In the other case, using the arrow function, "this" isn't changed.

[00:31:00] <NinjaKirby> Oh, sorry if I'm being slow, but my erroneous one is because 'this' is referring to the anonymous function it's encased inside?
[00:32:05] <austincheney> NinjaKirby, in an arrow function "this" is lexical, so "this" points to the first containing reference.  In all other cases "this" points to that which called the containing function.

[00:42:51] <austincheney> NinjaKirby, perhaps the problem isn't the array methods, but it could be your thinking about functions and portability.  In JS functions can go just about everywhere.
[00:43:25] <austincheney> NinjaKirby, you could also define the function value separately and then pass into the array method later:  myArray.map(myMapFunction);

[00:48:56] <austincheney> Everything, in the case of some syntax errors the browser will not tell you where the error occurs because it cannot interpret the code.
[00:49:09] <Everything> austincheney: should I use some external JS compiler for that?
[00:49:10] <austincheney> Everything, it will tell you where the error is in the case of run time errors

[00:50:24] <austincheney> Everything, I recommend using a JavaScript aware editor that yells at you when you make syntax errors.
[00:50:38] <austincheney> Everything, that way you are notified of the error as you are typing the code.

[03:08:13] <onosendi> Hmm, what's a good toolchain to develop for a CLI app? I'm using webpack with webpack-dev-server, and having it write to disk, then `node main.js` to test. This seems kind of tedious, any better ideas? I can't simply `node foo.js`, because it's using typescript, and some of the libraries are ESM, and some are CommonJS, so it needs to be bundled/transpiled in some way.

[14:27:15] <Dorward> Generally, sudo is used to run things as root. It's a convenient way to install things globally to the system Node.js. This isn't great because running stuff as root gives full access so it is a security nightmare for random installers from npm. Installing stuff globally is frowned upon these days too (we have npx now). In the case of your example, you are using sudo to run a specific command as a different, non-root user.
[14:27:15] <Dorward>  That solves the security issue. If you are building a production server then it is a good way to isolate each service that you are going to be running (so they can't interfere with each other if one is compromised). If you're doing that though, then it would be likely there is more setup to be done as the specific user and you might as well su to them for a bit instead of running each command one by one. (That said, I'd tend
[14:27:15] <Dorward>  to use Docker to solve that problem instead).
[14:29:32] <stdInOut> Dorward, if docker would be an alternative, sure I can do it

[16:46:22] <audiobirb> so, I'm making a music service, and my goal is to make it hard to download raw audio files. with a js framework, i'm thinking the raw mp3 would not be findable in the html as it would be loaded dynamically, but it can still be found in the network tab. i'll be hosting mp3s at s3. is there some way i can make my mp3s at s3 only accessible from a certain whitelist of sites so that if a user tries to access it, they get permission denied?

[18:49:11] <ox1eef> if you must use a select, then you have to fake it. i dont think there is any other way.
[18:49:26] <ox1eef> there's also libs handling that way, such as select2.

[18:54:50] <fweht> is there a way to get react running in the code snippet functionality from stackoverflow?  i cant bring it to accept import statements somehow...
[18:57:55] <Dorward> You can get import statements working by using `<script type="module">` in the HTML section instead of the JavaScript section … but then that won't play well with client-side Babel which you'll need for JSX nor will it support Node.js module resolution (i.e. you'll need full URLs to the modules). Best to just load any dependencies with <script> elements instead.

[20:31:54] <horribleprogram> how I compile typescript if I'm unable to get some sort of definitions
[20:32:03] <Dorward> One of the great benefits of modules is that they *don't* spit out globals all over the place. The API is designed so if you want to use something in a module, you require it from another module. So you put juice_obj = juice(); juice_obj.method(); inside index.js. (Browserify probably has an option to make certain variables globals, but I don't know what that is off the top of my head, and I wouldn't recommend that approach).
[20:32:03] <Dorward>  Also a <script> element loads a single script from either the URL in the src of the textContent of the element - NOT both.

[20:37:24] <Dorward> Don't confuse modules with Node.js.
[20:37:53] <Dorward> If you're going to use modules then its best to lean into using them and structure all your code around them.
[20:37:55] <qswz> you shouldn't need to use browserify for server-side code
[20:38:13] <qswz> or webpack

[20:45:08] <last1> when you copy / paste formatted Excel tables, on Windows, Chrome doesn't automatically inline the css
[20:45:13] <last1> on Mac it does it automagically somehow
[20:45:21] <austincheney> like Dorward is saying its probably safer and faster to avoid JS for this and manually update your HTML by hand.

[23:54:16] <ox1eef> in the browser? you dont worry about that, the browser handles it. in node? keep the socket open.
[23:55:14] <onosendi> ox1eef: 'keep the socket open' - I'm not familiar with sockets :/
[23:55:43] <ox1eef> is this node then? if youre lucky, the http lib will handle it for you but id check for support first

[23:56:57] <Alexendoo> That's an educational resource for explaining how HTTP works
[23:57:13] <ox1eef> not neccesarily, no - the http lib often handles it.
[23:57:24] <Alexendoo> You wouldn't use any of that in actual code, HTTP clients do all of this stuff for you
