[00:17:26] <LambdaComplex> sounds right
[00:17:31] <LambdaComplex> >A function that is never request-specific may use context.Background(), but err on the side of passing a Context even if you think you don't need to. The default case is to pass a Context; only use context.Background() directly if you have a good reason why the alternative is a mistake.

[00:21:49] <A_Dragon> eg a calls b which calls c, where you control a and c but not b
[00:21:56] <A_Dragon> but also they're not type safe and and and
[00:22:03] <A_Dragon> I think http uses them for a few things but not much
[00:22:13] <bpalmer> one of the most cited examples I've seen is storing metadata about the context for use by, e.g., the networking machinery
[00:22:38] <bpalmer> so the context values will contain things like "what account should be charged for this traffic? What permissions do they have to access more resources?"
[00:23:21] <bpalmer> stuff that none of the things inside the functions being called should care about, but which should tag along if they make further requests.

[04:36:25] <b0nn> Is the const keyword not immutable enough?
[04:37:05] <b0nn> Or are you looking for functions that can be constants?
[04:37:06] <seebs> you can't make const things of a lot of types

[04:37:34] <seebs> i was mostly thinking things like, say, a way to express "a slice of bytes, but not a modifiable one" as, say, a thing you could pass to a function.
[04:37:50] <seebs> so that you could make one from a string without having to copy the string's bytes into modifiable storage.

[14:24:02] <SeedyROM> Hello
[14:24:23] <bookworm> o/
[14:24:46] <SeedyROM> Anyone have any fun ideas for an intermediate level project in Go? Trying to boost my skills and I'm tired of making Rest APIs or web stuff.
[14:26:01] <bookworm> pick your favorite cli tool and replicate it, write a TUI, or GUI of something
[14:26:09] <bookworm> RSS reader or what have you
[14:26:34] <sztanpet> or an irc client!

[14:27:47] <SeedyROM> Interesting, I like the RSS reader idea and IRC too.
[14:28:26] <A_Dragon> if you want extra credit
[14:28:28] <SeedyROM> In terms of IRC should I be reading the RFCs etc to get the full tech spec? Or are there other approaches besides following tutorials.
[14:28:32] <A_Dragon> support IRCv3
[14:28:33] <b0nn> FTP client (after the IRC client, because FTP can be a mindf*ck)
[14:28:39] <A_Dragon> SeedyROM: modern.ircdocs.horse
[14:28:44] <A_Dragon> is about the most up to date
[14:28:51] <A_Dragon> dont read 1459 things are different now
[14:29:04] <SeedyROM> A_Dragon: Thank you, I'm gonna check that out.
[14:29:09] <A_Dragon> but you can do basic IRC in <200LoC
[14:30:04] <Sam> Or just pick up some issues on any existing open source project to help out :)
[14:31:03] <A_Dragon> ^
[14:31:23] <A_Dragon> hmm I should do an IRC bot that asks the playground if some code has compile errors
[14:31:31] <A_Dragon> could be nice for in here
[14:32:05] <SeedyROM> Sam: I always struggle to find a good entrypoint for open source bug squashing.
[14:32:17] <SeedyROM> Also that bot idea sounds like it could help alot.

[16:38:33] <A_Dragon> Generally go modules contain sums of the libraries they use
[16:38:44] <A_Dragon> it will also check the sums against the go sum database

[16:39:00] <A_Dragon> m
[16:39:07] <muhblockchain> it uses like 2 internal modules or something?  how to manually download theses modules, build them from local files, then build the rest from local files?   im on debian btw
[16:40:11] <A_Dragon> it uses one set of libraries that are included with itself, it might still download those, but $shrug, the other library is on github
[16:40:32] <A_Dragon> you can `go get` those libraries if you want to inspect them first, they appear in $GOPATH/src, IIRC

[23:26:13] <oliv3> hi, this is driving me nuts :( i'm summing a slice of 25k uint64, and the displayed sum doesn't look at all correct. i dump the array to disk in-between, and when i restart the simulation, the sum is correctly displayed... 🤔 here's an example: https://paste.debian.net/1206706/

[23:30:34] <A_Dragon> are you sure you're not overflowing an int64?
[23:31:32] <A_Dragon> or alternatively, possibly working with stale data?
[23:31:36] <oliv3> it's uint64 everywhere, and casts where needed, so i don't see
[23:31:46] <A_Dragon> yeah uh
[23:31:55] <A_Dragon> if you cast to int64 you cut the max size in half

[23:35:10] <foobaz> you could use math/big to add without overflow
[23:35:18] <A_Dragon> 18446744073709551615 9223372036854775807
[23:35:23] <A_Dragon> uint64 and int64 respectively

[23:35:27] <foobaz> or float64 to get an estimate without overflow
[23:35:51] <A_Dragon> f64 will struggle at that size too
[23:36:19] <foobaz> but it won't overflow, it will have low precision
[23:36:57] <foobaz> big.Int is guaranteed to give the correct result but it's more work
[23:37:10] <A_Dragon> probably work better

[23:37:23] <A_Dragon> though personally I find the ux for big to be AWFUL
[23:37:45] <A_Dragon> I severely dislike how operators are implemented

[23:40:14] <oliv3> hmmm my values are way under max int64/uint64
[23:40:15] <foobaz> i think the go authors were traumatized by operator overloading in C++ and vowed never to let it happen in go

[23:41:04] <foobaz> oliv3: are you adding in multiple goroutines? maybe it's a race condition
[23:41:10] <oliv3> in the big package i can only see NewInt(int64), there's no uint64
[23:41:54] *** Quits: independent56 (~independe@148.122.187.2) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:41:56] <foobaz> use SetUint64
[23:42:02] <oliv3> and no, the sum is done in a plain for loop
[23:42:02] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@122.172.235.24) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[23:45:12] <A_Dragon> foobaz: even if so. the ux for Add and co is awful. the sigs are (i *Int) Add(a, b) where a and b are added and set to i, rather than adding i to a, or anything even slightly more "ergonmoic" I find it exceptionally irksome to work with big to the point that I often just switch to python if I need giant numbers and lob pypy at the problem

[23:55:46] <oliv3> what's strange to me is that evaluate() works fine when the population is loaded, then doesn't work anymore, but the population is dumped to disk on each run, and stopping and restarting displays the correct values
[23:56:03] <A_Dragon> are you stomping on chunks of the slice somewhere?

[23:59:40] <A_Dragon> do you unintentionally modify pop.Phenotypes somwhere?
[23:59:51] <A_Dragon> check the length of the slice
