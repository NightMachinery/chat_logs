[00:00:03] <znf> if I don't -async/vsync, does it break the a+v sync?
[00:00:10] <hyperfekt> ah, so it won't work for all decoders? that explains why i am still seeing corruption despite that flag
[00:00:18] <JEEB> it's on the demux level, not decode
[00:00:30] <JEEB> as in, if the reader (like the MPEG-TS one) can notice that something's off
[00:00:40] <JEEB> the libavformat library will just not output that AVPacket
[00:01:23] <hyperfekt> ah, got it. so i guess if i haven't already been seeing corrupt packet warnings it's not going to help me
[00:01:42] <JEEB> znf: the (badly named) vsync option in ffmpeg.c should be completely irrelevant, since the timestamps of the packets are what matters
[00:02:06] <znf> hm, ok
[00:02:15] <JEEB> your filter chain and other stuff decides what happens if you f.ex. miss a video frame
[00:02:38] <znf> so what's the advantage of using +discardcorrupt if I'd be transcoding?
[00:02:38] <JEEB> and well, vsync can attempt to do frame duplication by itself, but it is not "vsync"
[00:02:49] <JEEB> less chances of throwing garbage at a decoder
[00:02:55] <JEEB> I'm using +discardcorrupt myself
[00:03:07] <JEEB> because it's much more likely that a completely broken packet will cause damage in a decoder
[00:03:15] <znf> yeah, I've seen that often
[00:03:49] <JEEB> I quickly checked what MPEG-TS reader utilizes to figure out if a packet is corrupt and it's pretty understandable stuff
[00:03:53] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)

[00:04:16] <JEEB> I think it was a PES packet mismatch and the counter not being continuous?
[00:04:34] <JEEB> in either case shit's happened and maybe it's a good idea to drop the packet on the floor :)
[00:04:47] <znf> but if I'm just -c copy from mpegts to mpegts, with +discardcorrupt, what happens to the missing frames? :P
[00:05:00] <znf> and will they not eventually skew the audio/video?
[00:05:07] <JEEB> mpeg-ts has thankfully timestamps
[00:05:11] <znf> I'm not entirely sure how DTS/PTS works in regards o audio/video sync
[00:05:18] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[00:05:57] <JEEB> PTS is what is always utilized for sync
[00:06:31] <JEEB> DTS is something utilized as another timestamp on the container level
[00:07:30] <znf> hm, you made me curious now
[00:07:40] <znf> I have a channel that always goes out of sync on my TV
[00:07:55] <JEEB> for analysis of MPEG-TS I recommend DVB Inspector
[00:07:58] <JEEB> has graphing etc
[00:08:01] <znf> (and it's traight copy from DVB-C)
[00:08:06] <JEEB> https://kuroko.fushizen.eu/screenshots/apple_mpegts/nice_timestamps_there.png
[00:08:15] <znf> And stop/starting it will resume correctly

[18:17:19] <bosonbear> Hi folks. I'm converting a mkv file to a gif but after the conversion I see a blinking/flickering effect in the gif. To describe it: the resolution becomes every other second, then image gets blurred, so on and so forth. Any idea what issue is this related to?
[18:18:10] <BtbN> A gif only has 256 colors to work with, so it's bound to look like crap
[18:19:29] <bosonbear> It's okay to look like crap, as long as the image is "stable". My problem is that sometimes it looks like crap, and the next second it's amazing, then crap again
[18:19:35] <bosonbear>  This flickering effect makes it even crappier than necessary
[18:20:08] <BtbN> it'll all depend on how well the colors in that frame can be represented with the pallet chosen
[18:20:23] <BtbN> You can try doing a two pass encode using palettegen/use
[18:21:54] <bosonbear> I see thanks BtbN

[19:00:52] <yuri6037> Hi, I have a big problem I can no longer get rid of tmcd sections with ffmpeg: this command "ffmpeg -i a.mov -c:v copy -c:a copy -write_tmcd 0 b.mov" no longer works it appears write_tmcd was removed or is now broken because it has absolutely no effect! Is there any other hack I can try to remove this annoying tmcd section?
[19:03:15] <durandal_1707> yuri6037: write_tmcd is still available
[19:03:39] <yuri6037> yeah but the fact is it does no longer have any effect
[19:04:57] <yuri6037> ok so now it's back rebooted mac terminal and it worked now ffmpeg is so unsatble and broken
[19:05:16] <durandal_1707> yuri6037: no, its is stable
[19:05:28] <durandal_1707> make sure you use correct version
[19:05:39] <yuri6037> well maybe for you it's unstable on my mac
[19:05:46] <durandal_1707> pebkac
[19:06:00] <yuri6037> thing is I always have problems with ffmpeg no matter if it's linux or mac
[19:06:49] <yuri6037> on linux it's just better because distributions of it with nvenc/dec has potential system crash
[19:06:59] <durandal_1707> yuri6037: you have issues with something else instead

[19:36:21] <tben> hi, wondering if anyone can help me.  I've got the demuxing example from the src and adjusted it to capture audio from microphone and dump it into a pcm file.  Its going well but it seems to be capturing every other frame - I'm wondering if this is because the example code is expecting video and audio frames but I can't see in the code where to adjust it accordingly. Any ideas?

[23:29:04] <babyface> -vn -acodec only copies the audio but why do I type if I only want to copy the video?
[23:29:47] <JEEB> -map 0:v maps all video streams from the 0th input, and then just say -c copy (copy for all mapped streams)
[23:30:05] <JEEB> by explicitly mapping things you disable auto-selection
[23:30:44] <babyface> is there a simpler method?
[23:30:58] <znf> -vcodec copy -an
[23:31:17] <JEEB> why is manual mapping more complex?
[23:31:31] <JEEB> if you want just audio, just say you want just audio. if you want just video you tell it that
[23:31:41] <JEEB> like, I would like to understand that attitude, where it comes from?
[23:31:59] <babyface> I never understood the map command I find it to be very confusing
[23:32:01] <JEEB> because -vn -acodec copy definitely does not ignore stuff like subtitles
[23:32:08] <JEEB> it will just disable video
[23:32:17] <JEEB> just like -an only disables audio
[23:32:29] <JEEB> (the codec types are: video, audio, subtitle, data)
[23:32:37] <babyface> I'm sorry but the map command doesn't make sense to me
[23:33:21] *** Quits: rsx (~dummy@ppp-188-174-156-38.dynamic.mnet-online.de) (Quit: rsx)
[23:34:15] <JEEB> I actually wonder if you don't even need to specify the input file index with map, I just have gotten used to do it since I often have more than one input file
[23:34:26] <JEEB> for example, -map v just mapping all inputs' all video streams
[23:34:31] <JEEB> or -map v:0 just the first one of those
[23:34:51] <JEEB> I just do way too much of -map 0:v -map 0:a for example
[23:34:54] <JEEB> *-map 1:a
[23:35:04] <JEEB> where I take video from first input, and audio from second
[23:36:04] <JEEB> but yea you can do `-c:v copy -an -sn -dn`
[23:36:08] <JEEB> that disables audio, subtitles and data
[23:36:13] <JEEB> and sets video to copy
[23:36:24] <JEEB> although at that point you might as well just utilize -c copy since you've only left one media type
[23:36:53] <JEEB> basically -vn -c copy only copies audio only if you have no subtitles or data streams in the input :P

[23:38:20] <JEEB> and that's why doing "I only want X" ends up being simpler with map than the "disable everything else" alternative. since you need to remember to disable all of the 3 you don't want out of 4. but eh, to each their own
