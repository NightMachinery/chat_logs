[02:24:53] <gilberth> SSH?
[02:25:42] <gilberth> Though I wonder how one would "type" things like c-m-x on a phone.
[02:26:54] <pjb> gilberth: actually, you can, with the keyboard provided in apps such as terminal emulators.
[02:27:03] <pjb> You have sticky modifiers.
[02:27:37] <gilberth> ok. But is this actually usable? Perhaps not for me, I just cannot "type" on a phone anyway.
[02:27:43] <pjb> but it's indeed kind of idiotic to try to use emacs on a tablet or a phone, if you don't configure a whole new set of bindings using not keys, but touches.
[02:28:12] <pjb> gilberth: that's why if you want to use emacs, you want to use a bluetooth keyboard with your mobile computer.
[02:28:49] <pjb> Note that with an actual keyboard, almost all iPad applications become sudently way more usable.
[02:28:57] <gilberth> When I would carry around a keyboard I could as well carry around a small laptop.
[02:29:04] <pjb> They have hidden features accessible only from an actual keboard.
[02:29:14] <pjb> gilberth: lol, indeed.
[02:29:36] <pjb> but a bluetooth keyboard + iPad is still smaller and lighter than a laptop. So it can be a choice.
[02:29:54] <gilberth> Hmm.
[02:30:23] <pjb> But indeed.  And that's a reason why Apple made the choices their made about iPad not being programmable computers. 
[02:31:08] <pjb> But then, all this will be mute when we all have neuralink interfaces and we'll be able to program and edit documents directly with our brains‚Ä¶
[02:31:16] <gilberth> Yes, an iPad is a large phone, which you can't make a phone call with.
[02:31:31] <pjb> Then no need for any keyboard or screen.  You will commit directly from your brain to github.
[02:31:51] <pjb> gilberth: actually you can use iPad to phone.  No problem with that.
[02:31:59] <gilberth> You say, I have to control my thoughts then?

[02:33:27] <gilberth> Ah, ok. I seem to be the only one missing it.

[02:34:09] <gilberth> Far too narrow, my code would fold.
[02:34:49] <sm2n> how far do you go?
[02:35:10] <gilberth> I try to keep at 96, but allow for 120 usually.
[02:36:21] <gilberth> With the deep nesting of Lisp and the long identifiers, I just don't like unnaturual narrow indentation at the margin, where (foo bar baz) becomes (foo\n bar\n baz).
[02:36:47] <gilberth> And I tend to write too large a bit functions. :/

[06:44:59] * hayley runs redis and redis-benchmark to test a long-running hypothesis she had.
[06:45:57] <hayley> On that god-awful AWS video they demonstrated "similar performance" from Redis and their crappy clone. But when I run redis-benchmark with the default settings (which I can only assume they did) it only uses 60-75% CPU. So the default settings don't push it hard enough?
[06:50:04] <hayley> So not using threads or multiple cores for the server was an intentional decision. Dumb, but sure why not. 
[06:50:49] <hayley> Changing the connection count doesn't produce different results, but pipelining requests does. So we should fiddle with pipelining until someone bottlenecks first, and that someone is the loser. No?
[06:52:42] <hayley> With 1 pipelined request we get a mere 90k operations/second on my desktop, with 100 we rather get 1.89M operations/second. The latter looks more likely to find a bottleneck.
[06:56:22] <hayley> Since the work for a GET or SET is just about parsing the packet, doing one hash table operation, then sending a response, I bet that 90k/second is context switching.
[06:58:34] <hayley> Oh, they mention it in the video: "The default options don't stress out the server to the max [...] it's still plenty fast."

[12:07:43] * hayley tweaks the "use multiple connections to actually give the GPU something to do" approach
[12:08:07] <hayley> Seems that 3 connections is the right tradeoff between throughput and the other server getting mad at me for solving things too fast.
[12:09:41] <hayley> Still, $0.60/day is barely more than the electricity it uses.
[12:10:45] <hayley> .oO( If I can write a dumb miner for this thing, are there any poorly done real CPU cryptocurrencies that I could own? Probably not. )

[12:19:45] <pjb> shka: they're picky.  They can, given the lack of demand for lispers‚Ä¶
[12:20:03] <shka> *sigh*
[12:20:11] <shka> i let my hopes get high
[12:20:25] <shka> i shouldn't have
[12:21:58] <hayley> Someone I know was less than impressed by the wages they publish. Though I got two offers from Ravenpack for some reason.
[12:23:12] <pjb> I note that nowadays, Lispworks provides compilers to target iOS and Android; I guess something like wukix mocl (which by the way seems to have disappeared,  wukix.com redirects to https://github.com/Wukix and the sources of mocl are not published).
[12:23:13] -ixelp- Wukix ¬∑ GitHub
[12:23:54] <pjb> shka: so, I'd say, use lispworks to develop mobile apps and make yourself a living writing lisp code thru Google and Apple app stores.
[12:25:40] <shka> i can use ECL instead
[12:25:42] <shka> :P
[12:25:56] <shka> or... can one use ABCL on android?
[12:26:02] <shka> this would be cool
[12:26:22] <hayley> I heard the JVM is sufficiently different to prevent that.
[12:26:34] <easye> shka: ABCL on android is somewhat possible:  you only get an interpreter.
[12:26:44] <easye> Which in practice it makes it a non-platform.
[12:28:44] <shka> what a shame
[12:40:28] <pjb> shka: note that abcl targets the JVM, but on android, a different VM is used (previously, Dalvik; and now ART).
[12:40:44] <shka> yeah, got it
[12:41:17] <pjb> that said there are tools to convert from the JVM to the other VM.
[12:41:19] <shka> ART is not as well suited toward CL anyway

[13:03:26] <hayley> Hm, isn't it fun when a "software development engineer" from Amazon presents benchmark results which are measuring context switch latency and nothing more, when the presentation is definitely not about context switching?
[13:03:47] <hayley> shka: I'm not saying he's an idiot and so you should have no problem finding work since you have a brain, but you know I'm saying all that.
[13:08:20] <shka> hayley: the last time i was looking for job it took me 4 months
[13:10:06] <shka> otherwise
[13:10:36] <shka> anybody well acquainted with the postmodern? i am having problems with the savepoint
[13:11:05] <shka> i think it is the savepoint, anyway
[13:12:42] <hayley> I've used it, but never noticed savepoints.
[13:13:07] <hayley> What's the problem?
[13:14:16] <shka> i want to have nested transaction, and in case of the failure, i want only the nested transaction to get rollbacked, not the top level one
[13:14:41] <shka> but i think that everything gets rollbacked anyway
[13:14:43] * hayley nods in a way that suggests she has no clue what is going on
[13:17:21] <hayley> So, something like BEGIN; commit this stuff SAVEPOINT <name>; don't commit this stuff; ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT <name>; COMMIT;
[13:17:57] <hayley> (What's the opposite of an awesome-<foo> list? shit-<foo> list?)
[13:18:20] <shka> i will try to solve other problem first
[13:18:28] <shka> then i will move to this nested stuff

[14:17:49] <hayley> SQL can dead/livelock, right?
[14:29:13] <shka> yeah
[14:31:06] <hayley> Right. /me is still wondering about if there is a better way to lock rather than the WITH-RESOURCES-HELD macro she has, which hashes some names and grabs only the locks in a vector corresponding to them (in some defined order). But evidently nesting W-R-H won't work.

[15:08:55] <shka> hayley: well, you can have a separate vector of booleans informing which locks are held
[15:09:16] <shka> could be stored in a special variable, so it will follow the stack implicitly

[15:17:50] <hayley> Well, nesting could lead to deadlock with pretty much the standard example of that.
[15:19:48] <shka> hayley: yeah, so the first level of "with-resources-held" would allocate object and bind it to the *held-resources*, subsequent w-r-h would first check if the lock is already held according to the *held-resources*
[15:20:40] <hayley> But that doesn't help when one thread has A and wants B as well, and another has B and wants A as well.
[15:25:38] <hayley> https://theemacsshibe.gitlab.io/documentation/decentralise2.html#%28idx._%28gentag._71%29%29 specifies the higher-level interface which just pulls the lock vector from a system. But come to think of it I need to say that technically nested W-R-H on different lock vectors/systems is fine...

[15:34:14] <shka> windows critical sections kinda make sense, huh?
[15:43:49] <ck_> unrelated, but also windows: have you followed the "colored text in a terminal is a phd-level problem" discussions?
[15:44:13] <pjb> with lisp or without lisp?
[15:44:24] <pjb> Most problems are PhD-level problems if you don't use lisp.
[15:45:52] <hayley> Unfortunately, I have.
[15:46:15] <hayley> And may I say that I don't care about the "poor little developers" who don't get 1GB/s terminal output or something like that
[15:46:39] <White_Flame> I've engaged with too many PhDs on the job, it's only used as an insult as far as I'm concerned anymore
[15:46:58] <ck_> :) that's an entirely different conversation
[15:47:29] <White_Flame> so a "phd level problem" is one that anybody without their head stuck up their butt could solve with medium effort
[15:47:57] <ck_> [harumphing intensifies] ( .. probably )
[15:49:40] <ck_> it's a miracle that anything on windows more or less works, still. Have you seen what windows 10 interfaces to system configuration look like? I'm talking about the gui even
[15:50:12] <shka> it looks like a website 
[15:50:38] <White_Flame> platform specific gui coding is something I've intentionally avoided over the years :-P
[15:50:50] <White_Flame> (unless it's a platform I wrote ;) )
[15:50:57] <hayley> Now, if Blow et al could write something non-useless like a description of how the fuck vector clocks map onto some real memory model, then maybe I'd care, but currently I couldn't care less about pixel pushing.
[15:51:01] <ck_> yeah, sometimes. depending on where you go, it looks like a material-ui website or a windows xp frame
[15:53:33] <ck_> White_Flame: how do you do graphics?
[15:53:44] <White_Flame> retro platforms
[15:53:55] <hayley> (Of course their response would be "lol git gud skrub don't write data races in the first place" and that you should be writing assembler on a machine that electrocutes you if fewer than 99% memory accesses hit cache...)
[15:54:52] <hayley> (I would like such a tool for CL, but even with Bike's draft synchronisation spec I'm not sure how to translate it to a race detector.)
[15:56:05] <ck_> White_Flame: like the c64 floppy drive? I assume you've seen that demo
[15:56:17] <White_Flame> hah, yeah that one's pretty awesome
[15:56:24] <White_Flame> c64 is my main platform
[15:56:48] <ck_> oh nice!
[16:17:58] <ck_> can you log onto here from a c64?
[16:19:55] <White_Flame> I know there are some people in #c64friends that do
[16:20:35] <ck_> that's awesome, I hadn't even had the thought until now

[23:52:05] <selwyn> what would you prefer
[23:56:15] <shka> well, i don't think that Poland needs nearly as many tanks as it has right now
[23:57:37] <shka> and besides, Abrams is problematic because it needs strong logistic chain, and the massive weight makes rivers a problem
[23:58:11] <shka> also, i am not sure if it even can be transported on the rail
[23:59:01] <shka> korean K2 makes more sense to me
[23:59:35] <shka> also, autoloader, which is good because there is not nearly enough of tank crews in the army
