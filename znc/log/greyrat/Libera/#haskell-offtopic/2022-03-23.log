[14:41:36] <boxscape> abastro: they want to emphasize that they're all about the "metaverse" now
[14:41:58] <abastro[m]> Wat is even metaverse, I don't see what it is
[14:42:13] <boxscape> that's the point, no one knows what it is, so you can use the term to describe anything :)
[14:42:27] <abastro[m]> Hahaha
[14:42:27] <boxscape> basically though, something VR-related
[14:42:31] <boxscape> anything VR-realted
[14:42:54] <abastro[m]> That said, it would be a risky bet for such corporation to rely on that.
[14:42:57] <boxscape> yeah that's true
[14:43:14] <abastro[m]> Oh VR business. So basically the one which would take at least half a decade
[14:43:28] <boxscape> probably yes
[14:43:45] <abastro[m]> Idk my pessimistic view says a decade so I halved it
[14:44:27] <Logio_> as best I've been able to make out, the vision is that metaverse ~ advertiser-friendly VRchat with purchasable virtual assets
[14:44:55] <kuribas> Logio_: do they come with an NFT?
[14:45:08] <Logio_> I think that's part of the idea
[14:45:37] <boxscape> abastro: I guess the question is how much of a result you need before you consider it "complete", facebook is already doing a lot of VR stuff via oculus (though they're getting rid of that brand name), but don't really have anything yet I'd describe as a "metaverse"
[14:45:39] <Logio_> but obviously it can't have anything actually decentralized, it has to be some Meta-approved and developed API
[14:47:38] <abastro[m]> Oh btw I just discovered you properly redirected me towards offtopic
[14:47:40] <abastro[m]> Thank you!
[14:48:12] <boxscape> you're welcome :)
[14:48:13] <abastro[m]> I see that Facebook is doing VR stuff, but I personally wonder how the market could grow.
[14:48:35] <kuribas> oculus rift is owned by facebook.
[14:48:47] <kuribas> sadly, I wouldn't have bought one if I knew that.
[14:48:57] <abastro[m]> In my view, there are lots of people like me who would not get involved in VR at least soon.
[14:50:49] <boxscape> I think if you have a really good offering where you can almost seemlessly transition between being in VR and not, and it's really comfortable, and the technical specs are such that you could have the equivalent of multiple monitors displayed in a VR headset, it has a lot of potential for market growth. Until then I suspect the market will stay somewhat small
[14:51:22] <abastro[m]> Yep, indeed
[14:51:53] <abastro[m]> I know that they say technology is growing exponentially. Though recent history of CPU says otherwise I think
[14:52:22] <merijn> I think VR has *tons* of potential...in very niche markets/applications
[14:52:30] <abastro[m]> Hmm I guess GPU could grow faster
[14:52:50] <boxscape> sometimes it's claimed that technology grows in spurts of logistic growth, which looks exponential at first
[14:53:24] <abastro[m]> Yep, that sounds more reasonable
[14:53:42] <abastro[m]> IIRC that was even in the singularity book who claims the singularity
[14:53:56] <abastro[m]> (Claimed singularity is still nowhere in sight tho)
[14:55:46] <boxscape> hm I'm generally skeptical of any claims that claim how soon singularity can or can't happen
[14:56:14] <boxscape> just seems very hard to predict
[14:56:58] <abastro[m]> Indeed, I agree. It is hard to predict single human's behavior, let alone whole society's
[14:57:47] <abastro[m]> <del>Could be next week if someone has been hiding it</del>
[14:58:05] <boxscape> not entirely impossible I suppose :)
[14:58:25] <abastro[m]> XD could be fun
[15:00:31] <merijn> oh, highly relevant to my #haskell comments: https://twitter.com/AlexBlechman/status/1457842724128833538
[15:15:38] <abastro[m]> Well to be honest though, I think there is more potential for metaverse than blockchain & NFT.
[15:16:01] <abastro[m]> (Saying this because I am sick of ppl around me talking about NFTs)
[15:16:32] <[exa]> +1 ^
[15:16:42] <[exa]> which doesn't imply that potential for metaverse is any big
[15:20:03] <boxscape> yeah that's fair
[15:20:49] <abastro[m]> It just feels like NFT is more scam than business of potency
[15:22:09] <abastro[m]> Perhaps I am wrong, but.. when I see the companies claiming to work on NFTs.. It does not seem like they are being honest and creating a proper business. Indeed, casino is also a business, but..
[15:23:22] <boxscape> I don't really understand the mindset of people buying NFTs, but then, I also don't buy traditional art
[15:24:53] <abastro[m]> Yea, I am a bit different that I value traditional art - especially when not involved with mone
[15:25:03] <abastro[m]> Honestly indeed when money is involved, it is going to be complex
[15:25:08] <boxscape> yeah
[15:25:11] <merijn> boxscape: That's the wrong perspective
[15:25:21] <abastro[m]> But, art provides novel value and a perspective
[15:25:23] <merijn> the mindset of NFT buyers isn't that of art buyers
[15:25:45] <boxscape> I don't have anything against art, I just haven't found a reason to buy art
[15:25:47] <merijn> The mindset of NFT buyers are people buying into MLM, ponzi schemes, and other get rich quick schemes. Also, gamblers
[15:25:59] <abastro[m]> Oh, me too. I also do not have money to buy art, tho.
[15:26:19] <abastro[m]> Btw by NFT companies I meant game companies which attach NFT to their game assets
[15:26:30] <abastro[m]> And sell the business as groundbreaking. Duh
[15:26:38] <boxscape> hm yeah
[15:26:45] <abastro[m]> I thought that was typical business around NFT, maybe it isn't
[15:27:06] <abastro[m]> Yea I kind of see how NFT could be used in art. Games tho..
[15:34:13] <abastro[m]> Yea, game company & NFT is never decentralized
[15:34:20] <abastro[m]> Like that is one of the most suspicious part
[15:35:18] <abastro[m]> Oh noo
[15:35:27] <abastro[m]> I mean yea, great for niche market
[15:35:37] <abastro[m]> Idk if it could approach broader market soon
[15:35:57] <abastro[m]> So many people think it is nearly there.. I facepalm

[15:41:20] <abastro[m]> Hm when was the book published?
[15:41:49] <abastro[m]> I did hear of a comic book which actually praised metaverse - it was from East Asia somewhere

[15:45:23] <abastro[m]> Imho it is worse scheme than crypto itself though
[15:46:04] <abastro[m]> Tho what can I do, when the world is going that way.. Meh I am hating the world more and more
[15:46:14] <abastro[m]> Perhaps I am too wary of hypes?
[15:46:17] <boxscape> fyi it looks like the matrix bridge is delayed right now, so expect some discontinuities in conversation
[15:46:34] <kuribas> NFT is like buying an entry in a dictionary.
