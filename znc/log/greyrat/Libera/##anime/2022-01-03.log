[02:08:59] <KatrinValerie> A well trained neural network would create better artwork!
[02:09:09] <Urchin[emacs]> KatrinValerie: IDK, I'd say that 2017 still has more charm than what comes out now in terms of æsthetic
[02:09:17] <KatrinValerie> but on the otherhand, the ideal artwork for me is fractals
[02:09:22] <KatrinValerie> I can stare at them for hours and hours
[02:09:29] <Urchin[emacs]> lol
[02:10:01] <KatrinValerie> Is that really funny?
[02:10:08] <KatrinValerie> I just like the self similarity
[02:10:18] <Satin> I'd get bored easily
[02:10:36] <KatrinValerie> There is always something new, nothing repeats in a proper fractal that's the cool thing
[02:10:52] <KatrinValerie> like if you zoom in on the mandelbrot set it is absolutely beautiful
[02:11:01] <markon101> Indeed
[02:11:05] <markon101> Very pretty
[02:11:05] <KatrinValerie> in a way you could think of the universe as a fractal too
[02:11:21] <Satin> natural landscapes are far more interesting for me

[02:21:52] <Satin> make sure to clean your keyboard
[02:22:03] <MootPoot> I lost my keyboard cleaning brush
[02:22:43] <Satin>  uh oh
[02:22:47] <Satin> now she'll have to clean it instead
[02:27:06] <JesseDesu> i use an airbrush to clean my keyboard
[02:27:10] <JesseDesu> without paint ofc

[02:30:34] <Sapphirus> Remove every keycap, vacuum, clean each keycap and reinstall each keycap.
[02:30:43] <Sapphirus> I do that at least once every 6 months.
[02:31:14] <JesseDesu> sounds like an enormous waste of time and risk                                                                 
[02:31:26] <JesseDesu> git an air compressor
[02:31:36] <JesseDesu> done in 30 seconds
[02:32:09] <Sapphirus> What risk? 
[02:32:13] <JesseDesu> i pryed off a laptop keycap because it felt sticky and when i put it back on it was fuct
[02:32:26] <JesseDesu> i dont think it was meant to be serviced like that
[02:32:29] <Sapphirus> Cherry MX keycaps are easy to remove and reseat
[02:32:41] <Sapphirus> They were designed to be removed.
[02:33:10] <JesseDesu> compressed air will get every cheetoh crumb
[02:33:17] <JesseDesu> set it to 50psi
[02:33:28] <Sapphirus> An air compressor could possibly damage the switches by blowing dirt and dust into them.
[02:33:42] <JesseDesu> that doesnt make any sense
[02:33:53] <Sapphirus> Vacuum takes like two seconds once the keycaps are removed.
[02:34:04] <JesseDesu> when the keycap is on its sealed right
[02:34:40] <MootPoot> I just use canned air 
[02:34:53] <JesseDesu> what kind of shitty design lets dirt into the switch when the cap is on
[02:35:09] <JesseDesu> canned air works but in the long run expensive
[02:35:29] <JesseDesu> and it loses strength after 10 seconds

[02:35:49] <Sapphirus> Cleaning each individual keycap with 70% IPA + vacuuming the board is better imho.
[02:35:55] <Sapphirus> Don't have to drag my keyboard outside into the freezing cold
[02:35:59] <JesseDesu> gotta warm up the can to keep it alive
[02:36:00] <Sapphirus> and I can perform a deep clean.
[02:36:11] <JesseDesu> lol
[02:36:18] <JesseDesu> do what you want
[02:36:51] <JesseDesu> i mean, if i wanted an engine rebuild and you knew how, i would go to you
[02:37:17] <JesseDesu> sorry that seems backhanded
[02:37:35] <JesseDesu> i meant i appreciate people who do a thorough job if i need it
[02:37:36] <Sapphirus> I also wipe the board itself down.
[02:37:53] <Sapphirus> An air compressor misses a lot.
[02:38:28] <JesseDesu> then do 100psi

[02:40:22] <JesseDesu> discord is devouring my hdd space
[02:40:29] <KatrinValerie> Urchin[emacs]: that's the kind of shit you see on real high doses of lsd
[02:40:30] <notchris> that sounds dubious
[02:40:37] <KatrinValerie> in regards to the fractal zoom video
[02:40:38] <JesseDesu> i dunno why but the cache folder gets bloated
[02:41:03] <KatrinValerie> but it's different because you in there with all your senses
[02:42:18] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: if discord is taking all your cache space you have bigger problems
[02:42:47] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: the problem with that is if you have a normal keyboar
[02:42:55] <MootPoot> where the keys are like deperessed into the board a little
[02:43:06] <MootPoot> low profiles are completely flat, their switches are not depressed
[02:43:45] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, yes, it's styilised kind've like a Model M.

[04:00:18] <Fenderbassist> I can understand

[04:05:51] <Sapphirus> I do, MootPoot.
[04:05:53] <MootPoot> woah
[04:06:01] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: ok noob question time
[04:06:01] <JesseDesu> mcdonalds
[04:06:15] <MootPoot> what happens when you mount a drive on /mnt , but another drive was already mounted on it
[04:06:23] <gh0s1> I use arch btw
[04:06:31] <gh0s1> MootPoot: replaces the mount
[04:06:38] <MootPoot> the other drive in question was the drive my OS was installed on
[04:06:51] <Sapphirus> what gh0s1 said.
[04:07:00] <MootPoot> so to fix this I just unmount?
[04:07:14] <Sapphirus> and remount the other again? Yes.
[04:07:35] <MootPoot> nvme0n1 ( my OS drive ) was mounted on /mnt by default, but then I mounted a usb hdd on it , then I realized my bork and mounted the hdd again on /home/mydrive
[04:07:58] <Sapphirus> unmount /home/mydrive and remount nvme0n1 to /mnt
[04:08:12] <MootPoot> how tf is the OS still working if I unmounted the OS
[04:08:14] <MootPoot> drive
[04:08:18] <MootPoot> confuzzling
[04:08:22] <Sapphirus> why is the OS drive on /mnt
[04:08:45] <MootPoot> that's just the install script I used 
[04:08:59] <MootPoot> but I guess its running from a different partition ?
[04:09:06] <Sapphirus> Yes.
[04:10:39] <MootPoot> I think I unfucked myself
[04:10:42] <MootPoot> sweet
[04:10:45] <gh0s1> :D
[04:10:47] <gh0s1> also
[04:10:49] <MootPoot> I didnt know you could unmount a drive and still run
[04:10:49] <gh0s1> mount -a
[04:11:21] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, don't worry, you aren't actually able to just unmount a partition from a mount point that's in use by the system.
[04:11:31] <Sapphirus> So whatever partition which was mounted to /mnt wasn't crucial to the operation of your system.
[04:11:42] <Sapphirus> And definitely wasn't in use by any software or the kernel.
[04:11:49] * MootPoot stops panicking
[04:12:21] <MootPoot> ok, uh
[04:12:23] <MootPoot> next question
[04:12:26] <Fenderbassist> thank you for helping out
[04:12:33] <gh0s1> just remember to dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda :p
[04:12:35] <MootPoot> can I backup my whole system while I'm using it?
[04:12:35] <gh0s1> plz don't
[04:12:40] <gh0s1> yep
[04:12:42] <gh0s1> I do all the time
[04:14:05] <MootPoot> fsarchiver complains about not being able to mount the drive?
[04:14:11] <MootPoot> uh
[04:14:55] <MootPoot> WHATS SUPPOSED TO GO WHERE
[04:14:58] <MootPoot> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[04:15:04] <MootPoot> panik
[04:15:42] <Sapphirus> You could also just reboot your system and so as long as /etc/fstab hasn't been muckied, everything will return back to normal without you actually fudging something up.
[04:15:59] <MootPoot> I didnt do any fuckery in there
[04:16:07] <MootPoot> I should do that
[04:16:09] <MootPoot> brb rebooting
[04:16:43] <Fenderbassist> much obliged Sapphirus gh0s1

[04:17:40] <gh0s1> wb
[04:17:43] <Sapphirus> wb
[04:17:44] <gh0s1> could have just mount -a
[04:17:50] <gh0s1> and that would remount /etc/fstab
[04:17:53] <MootPoot> warner brothers
[04:18:35] <Sapphirus> Rebooting provides a fresh slate, though, and who nkows what else MootPoot was mucking around with.
[04:18:39] <gh0s1> true
[04:19:54] <MootPoot> its still complaining about not being able to mount it - I guess I cant use fsarchiver to try and backup my OS drive while its runnning

[04:27:26] <MootPoot> yes

[04:30:29] <MootPoot> every day
[04:30:34] <MootPoot> so I can recover if needed

[04:36:34] <Satin> just pointing out you have a 'lil exceptional/unique situation here

[04:36:56] <Satin> MootPoot: dew it again dew it again

[04:37:06] <MootPoot> and not everything

[05:43:09] <sentionics> MootPoot: tbh, I'm pretty unclear on that stuff myself. I know there's a distinction between Desktop Environment and Window Manager, but I really don't know what it is. That's what I get for being a windows guy though.

[05:44:04] <MootPoot> oh, I think that's why

[05:46:57] <sentionics> For now though, WSL gives me almost everything I want. I'd like to try a tiling window manager tbf, but I've been making due with Windows Win[+shift]+arrowkeys
[05:48:51] <MootPoot> Honestly leaning to do linux was just in my bucket list

[05:49:01] <MootPoot> might as well do that this winter
[05:50:01] <Satin> MootPoot: DEs or "Desktop Environments"
[05:50:10] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, technically X, or X11 rather, is the windowing system. Window manager runs atop of that.
[05:50:11] <Satin> are collections of small programs, and services and frameworks and stuff
[05:50:13] <sentionics> MootPoot: it was 82 F (28.8 C) yesterday. Now a sudden cold snap has us at 33 F (1.12 C)
[05:50:23] <Satin> that allow you to have graphical menus
[05:50:25] <Satin> you can point and click on
[05:50:33] <Satin> you can say that every DE has a window manager included in it 
[05:50:42] <Satin> e.g. kwin for KDE
[05:50:48] <Satin> KDE plasma*
[05:50:54] <MootPoot> So X11 makes the video
[05:51:05] <Satin> So when you specifically go out of your way to run a window manager
[05:51:17] <MootPoot> and the display manager/ environment /xfce4 tells X11 what to draw

[05:51:57] <Satin> XFCE, KDE Plasma, LXDE, OpenBox, Gnome are desktop environments.
[05:52:13] <JesseDesu> LXDE ftw

[05:52:44] <sentionics> Satin: ah, so basically, going WM alone just means skipping out on getting some prepackaged GUI programs/features with it (vs getting a DE).
[05:52:47] <Satin> Depends on the distro. Don't uninstall xfce first.

[05:55:20] <MootPoot> ok wait wait
[05:55:22] <Sapphirus> Login managers aren't required. You can start a session from a TTY, but that isn't as fancy.
[05:55:28] <MootPoot> is a login manager = window manageR?
[05:55:31] <Satin> NO.
[05:55:38] <Satin> Okay let me explain in detail.
[05:55:38] <MootPoot> ok
[05:55:53] <MootPoot> searching google for " find out my login manager" just returns like
[05:56:03] <MootPoot> how to find out your display manager
[05:56:12] <Satin> DE = Desktop environments. Think of this like packages that allow you to have fancy menus, like the windows start menu, wifi icons, and so on. Window managers are a compenent of this package.
[05:56:42] <Satin> WM = a component of DEs, but can also, if you're a power user, run by themselves and replace DEs. Barebones window managers like i3WM, and so on exist. You configure this by hand to get what you want.

[05:59:17] <MootPoot> all the google searches are just telling me how to get my displaymanager
[05:59:23] <MootPoot> Satin: that one returns awk
[05:59:46] <Sapphirus> Display managers generally supplant the functionality of xinit so it isn't required..
[06:00:00] <Sapphirus> Because not everyone likes logging in through a TTY and typing startx..
[06:00:09] <sentionics> using stuff like awk and tr to do text transformations in your shell scripts is POSIX friendly (#!/bin/sh), though bash has some stuff that might be prettier if you don't care about POSIX.
[06:00:27] <Sapphirus> Of course, that can be automated, so xinit is engaged as soon as you login through a TTY.
[06:00:32] <MootPoot> also why is this important

[06:31:58] <Sapphirus> no `Zephyr, Nvidia Optimus doesn't support wayland.
[06:32:01] <Sapphirus> lmao
[06:32:03] <MootPoot> its linked to lightdm

[06:32:28] <Satin> should have written me in his will

[06:33:52] <Satin> crashed
[06:33:59] <Satin> never booting into normal archlinux again
[06:34:06] <Satin> amigojapan: have some faith in people smh
[06:34:13] <sentionics> I felt like he was chatting with us from a second computer.
[06:34:16] <Satin> amigojapan: MootPoot has changed his stance on windows vs linux in recent week
[06:34:22] <Satin> sentionics: good point
[06:34:33] <Satin> s/week/weeks
[06:34:44] <Satin> he's not as much of a hardcore fanboy as you think
[06:34:46] <amigojapan> Satin: alright. I'll give him a chance
[06:34:48] <Sapphirus> I forgot that lightdm on arch linux by default doesn't install a greeter
[06:35:01] <Satin> Sapphirus: WHAT
[06:35:05] <Sapphirus> yeah
[06:35:06] <Satin> ...
[06:35:09] * Satin facepalms
[06:35:14] <Sapphirus> That's arch for you.
[06:35:18] <Sapphirus> so it probably failed. xd
[06:35:24] <`Zephyr> Is there a sane reason for making this choice?
[06:35:30] <sentionics> safeboot time.
[06:35:35] <Satin> Sapphirus: i swear to god
[06:35:36] <Satin> lol
[06:35:39] <sentionics> arch has some kind of safe boot mode right?
[06:35:56] <JesseDesu> why are we still talking about arch
[06:35:57] <amigojapan> Hey sentionics 
[06:36:02] <Sapphirus> Just needs to install a lightdm-*-greeter package and it'll work
[06:36:03] <sentionics> Heh amigojapan!
[06:36:04] <Satin> MootPoot: we forgot to tell you to install something else.
[06:36:04] <JesseDesu> lubuntu is where its at
[06:36:16] <Sapphirus> Hopefully lightdm just fails since it can't find a greeter and he can startx his way back.
[06:36:21] <amigojapan> sentionics: all Linux have something called single user mode
[06:36:28] <Satin> MootPoot: pacman -S lightdm-gtk-greeter

[06:37:56] <Sapphirus> If the display manager fails it'll fallback to a TTY and if not, he can ctrl+alt+f1 or something to return to a TTY to login.
[06:37:56] <Satin> wtf
[06:37:59] <JesseDesu> i forget what it actually is
[06:38:03] <Satin> Sapphirus: idk if he can do that
[06:38:07] <Satin> i used to that
[06:38:10] <JesseDesu> thats just the impression left in my memory
[06:38:12] <Satin> when plasma 5 was ultra buggy
[06:38:15] <Satin> on kubuntu
[06:38:16] <Satin> in 2015
[06:38:26] <amigojapan> sentionics: ah. No it is usually used for things like when you forget the password is the system and need to reset it

[06:38:56] <Satin> MootPoot: how did you get back in
[06:39:02] <MootPoot> it worked and my login worked 
[06:39:04] <MootPoot> But 
[06:39:10] <MootPoot> I switched to nvidia 
[06:39:20] <MootPoot> And now it works 
[06:39:21] <MootPoot> But
[06:39:25] <Satin> no butts
[06:39:25] <JesseDesu> i switched to geico
[06:39:25] <Sapphirus> but..?
[06:39:28] <MootPoot> My monitors are fucked up 
[06:39:31] <Satin> but deez
[06:39:33] <JesseDesu> xrandr
[06:39:42] <Satin> nvidia moment
[06:39:45] <MootPoot> You know the display setting thing 
[06:39:45] <sentionics> Everything before "but" doesn't count. Even any previous "but".
[06:39:55] <JesseDesu> be prepared to read a lengthy man pages

[06:40:25] <MootPoot> I can't get my mouse on the leftmost one 
[06:40:27] <Sapphirus> oh yes, you'll have to generate an xorg.conf file to correct that in lightdm, and you can just flip them inside your desktop environment.
[06:40:36] <JesseDesu> ubuntu has an xrandr front end
[06:40:41] <Sapphirus> Using whatever display management thing XFCE has

[06:41:26] <Satin> and lightdm correction
[06:41:53] <MootPoot> yeah aside from my monitors being out of order
[06:41:56] <MootPoot> I think it works 
[06:41:58] <Sapphirus> You can do it with nvidia's control panel.
[06:42:03] <Sapphirus> It'll generate an xorg.conf for you
[06:42:14] <JesseDesu> !g xrandr front end for arch linux

[06:42:50] <Sapphirus> otherwise what JesseDesu said
[06:42:54] <Sapphirus> if nto using nvidia drivers
[06:43:01] <Satin> he's using nvidia drivers i think
[06:43:06] <sentionics> hmmm. I have 4 monitors, but I now realize. I mostly only use 3 of them. The 4th is almost out of eye-shot, so I can hardly be arsed to look at it. Glorified Slack display.
[06:43:12] <Satin> MootPoot: try nvidia thingy first
[06:43:23] <Sapphirus> Should be called 'Nvidia X Server Settings'
[06:43:54] <MootPoot> wym
[06:44:01] <JesseDesu> all this should come standard if you installed MATE DE
[06:44:01] <MootPoot> theres no app in the menu called that
[06:44:03] <Sapphirus> or, nvidia-settings from your shell
[06:45:17] <Satin> Sapphirus: but waht if he's using https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/wiki
[06:45:17] <ImoutoBot> [title] Home · Askannz/optimus-manager Wiki · GitHub
[06:45:18] <Sapphirus> should probably elevate it with sudo or something if you want nvidia's application to be able to write the changes.
[06:45:20] <Satin> this isn't an official solution
[06:45:26] <Satin> it's a hacky solution some user came up with
[06:45:40] <Satin> > Before using optimus-manager, be aware that this is still a hacky solution and may have stability issues with some desktop environments/display managers.
[06:45:44] <Sapphirus> he should not be using optimus-manager
[06:45:46] <MootPoot> ?
[06:45:47] <Satin> "I will happily deprecate this tool the day Nvidia implements proper GPU offloading in their Linux driver."
[06:45:54] <Satin> Sapphirus: that's what he setup unfortunately
[06:45:56] <Sapphirus> Nvidia already provides the proper offloading.
[06:46:00] <Satin> Sapphirus: r u sure
[06:46:03] <Sapphirus> yes
[06:46:09] <MootPoot> nvidia-settings starts
[06:46:09] <Satin> ..................
[06:46:13] <MootPoot> or well
[06:46:14] <MootPoot> it installs

[06:46:29] <MootPoot> when I start on it, it dies

[06:46:43] <Sapphirus> he needs to back track. xd
[06:46:48] <sentionics> The secret to installing linux: have two computers. One computer so you can watch youtubers walking you through it, and the other so you can install it.
[06:46:57] <Sapphirus> pacman -S nvidia-prime and undo all of the optimus-manager shite
[06:46:59] <JesseDesu> Satin, stop what
[06:47:09] <Satin> JesseDesu: he's gonna ask what pgp is next
[06:47:12] <Satin> and you'll distract him
[06:47:13] <Sapphirus> Prime is officially supported by Nvidia on Linux
[06:47:14] <JesseDesu> hahah
[06:47:48] <Sapphirus> I can affirm that it works on my xps 15
[06:47:57] <Satin> great
[06:48:04] <Satin> MootPoot: how did you end up on the page you linked
[06:48:10] <Satin> i just noticed the guy wrote that shit in 2019

[06:48:33] <Fenderbassist> gnite all

[06:51:24] <Satin> that was having trouble with external monitors
[06:51:24] <MootPoot> should I just uninstall optimus-manager?
[06:51:35] <Satin> MootPoot: yes, apparently Sapphirus says that is outdated
[06:51:42] <Satin> and you should go with official nvidia stuff

[06:52:20] <Satin> ????
[06:52:27] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you should just give up on arch and use Ubuntu or something
[06:52:31] <Satin> i'm confused about what the right route is here
[06:52:33] <JesseDesu> optimus prime vs amazon prime, who wins
[06:52:33] <Sapphirus> Satin, I have no idea why
[06:52:35] <Satin> go with this user's custom shit
[06:52:38] <Satin> or go with nvidia's shit
[06:52:42] <Satin> WHICH ONE
[06:52:48] <Satin> shouldn't we ask the arch channel
[06:52:52] <Sapphirus> nvidia's shit will work without much fuckery
[06:53:04] * Satin shrugs arms
[06:53:11] <JesseDesu> arch channel is full of knowledge n*zis
[06:53:12] <Sapphirus> bumblebee and optimus-manager are relics from when Nvidia didn't actually support this crap
[06:53:15] <JesseDesu> not that i know
[06:53:19] <JesseDesu> i've heard tho
[06:53:20] <Satin> Sapphirus: interesting point
[06:53:40] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah i'm going to side with the idea that you should uninstall this shit and go with official nvidia stuff
[06:54:01] <JesseDesu> "read the f*cking manual"  "we're not here to hold your hand"  "do not necro bump this thread"
[06:54:10] <Sapphirus> I agree, JesseDesu.
[06:54:16] <MootPoot> well, its installed
[06:54:21] <Sapphirus> But this isn't #archlinux so I'm helping his hand
[06:54:29] <MootPoot> its a prerequisite for optimus manager
[06:54:40] <MootPoot> so I'm already using it , I only have 2 problems atm
[06:54:45] <MootPoot> how to rearrange my monitors
[06:54:47] <Sapphirus> Satin, he's yours. lol
[06:54:53] <MootPoot> and switch to the nvidia gpu
[06:54:54] <MootPoot> thats it
[06:55:19] <JesseDesu> with an xrandr front end you simply clickc and drag your monitors to the relative position you want
[06:55:22] <Sapphirus> far past my sleep time
[06:55:23] <JesseDesu> like windows 10
[06:55:30] <Satin> sleep well sap
[06:55:47] <JesseDesu> otherwise you need to read a lengthy man pages to manually configure it in a text file
[06:56:01] * sentionics necro bumps JesseDesu's 2 week vacation.
[06:56:07] <JesseDesu> sentionics,

[06:56:24] <JesseDesu> i can fly anywhere in the US

[06:56:26] <Satin> install this

[06:56:33] <JesseDesu> preferably not alaska or hawaii tho
[06:56:39] <Satin> pacman -S arandr
[06:56:50] <JesseDesu> you wont regret it
[06:56:58] <MootPoot> yes but that's just another display manager tho
[06:57:03] <JesseDesu> no
[06:57:08] <MootPoot> or is it something else
[06:57:11] <Satin> MootPoot: no, it's a **configuration tool** for x
[06:57:14] <Satin> xrandr
[06:57:15] <MootPoot> oh
[06:57:17] <JesseDesu> ^
[06:57:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: knowing about startx is pretty important. That is how you know that X is just another program ontop of the command line
[06:57:20] <Satin> you can run xrandr from the commandline
[06:57:21] <Satin> OR
[06:57:27] <Satin> you can use a GUI drop-and click frontend
[06:57:29] <Satin> like the one above
[06:57:42] <Satin> I've been using xrandr the commandline tool on my arch laptop for i3WM + external montiors
[06:57:44] <Satin> and i hate doing that
[06:57:49] <JesseDesu> its so easy your grandma can do it
[06:57:50] <Satin> so i suggest using this GUI frontend tool
[06:57:52] <sentionics> JesseDesu: I'm probably the worst US citizen to ask about where to actually go to have fun in the US. I have one place in the US that's truly fun to me: whatever room in my home has my computer in it.
[06:58:13] <JesseDesu> ok
[06:58:19] <JesseDesu> i was thinking of flying to you
[06:58:28] <JesseDesu> so you could teach me to fly a cessna

[06:58:43] <sentionics> JesseDesu, whoa, you wouldn't want this drunk teaching you that, lmao!
[06:58:44] <MootPoot> now what
[06:58:48] <Satin> run it
[06:58:53] <JesseDesu> run it
[06:58:55] <Satin> look it up in your applications list
[06:58:56] <MootPoot> its detecting them all
[06:58:56] <Satin> or something
[06:58:59] <Satin> ok
[06:59:02] <JesseDesu> sudo arandr
[06:59:02] <Satin> now can u use it
[06:59:04] <MootPoot> oh, in the cli
[06:59:05] <Satin> to configure ur monitors
[06:59:06] <sentionics> also, I haven't flown myself in over 13 years now.
[06:59:06] <MootPoot> or apps
[06:59:12] <Satin> it's a GUI frontend so
[06:59:42] <MootPoot> dont see it 
[06:59:48] <MootPoot> it made me install xorg-xrandr
[06:59:58] <Satin> yep
[07:00:00] <MootPoot> xrandr in the cli outputs a bunch of shit
[07:00:01] <Satin> that's a prerequiset
[07:00:02] <Satin> yes
[07:00:06] <Satin> and you can use either xrandr
[07:00:07] <MootPoot> but now what

[07:00:32] <JesseDesu> a for arch i presume
[07:00:33] <Satin> install the arandr package
[07:00:45] <Satin> pacman -S arandr
[07:00:55] <Satin> then run arandr, either from your applications if it's listed
[07:00:58] <sentionics> JesseDesu, that's a nice thought though, would be cool to hang out. But my shoddy apartment is ill equipped to entertain guests unfortunately. Also, Hammond is easily one of the most boring places in Louisiana.
[07:01:00] <Satin> or just arandr in the commandline
[07:01:07] <JesseDesu> ok sentionics

[07:12:05] <Satin> ButterNoodle: he tried to get https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/blob/master/README.md running (unofficial, arguably outdated, non-Nvidia)
[07:12:05] <ImoutoBot> [title] optimus-manager/README.md at master · Askannz/optimus-manager · GitHub
[07:12:20] <Satin> but realized he needed a compatible login/display manager or something for it
[07:12:20] <ButterNoodle> y tho
[07:12:26] <Satin> and he had none
[07:12:29] <ButterNoodle> oic
[07:12:31] <Satin> he was using startx all this time or something
[07:12:35] <Nanobot> When I was a kid, I was only allowed to say "big potty" and "little potty", not any other words for those things. This restriction significantly shaped my character as a human being, or some shit.
[07:12:37] <ButterNoodle> uhhh
[07:12:42] <JesseDesu> does nanobot understand what alcohol is made of?  barley
[07:12:45] <Satin> so he goes back and forth and finally has lightDM now
[07:12:52] <ButterNoodle> I though u were using a login manager
[07:12:55] <Satin> then he unisnstalls the custom one above
[07:13:04] <Satin> and is now going with official Nvidia driver
[07:13:07] <ButterNoodle> we installed xdm iirc
[07:13:11] <Satin> because that other guy said that does the same thing the unofficial one does

[09:22:16] <ButterNoodle> it just says "dont die"
[09:22:54] <JesseDesu> theres 2 manuals for life.  one is called the bible, i think.  i'm not sure what the other one is called
[09:23:08] <ButterNoodle> bible is more of a suggestion
[09:23:25] <Satin> how long does MootPoot 's shit laptop take to boot jeez
[09:23:34] * Satin boots up in 30 seconds at least
[09:23:38] <JesseDesu> windows fast boot is the fastest
[09:23:46] <Satin> linux is on par
[09:23:48] <JesseDesu> 5 seconds?
[09:23:48] <Satin> for me
[09:23:52] <ButterNoodle> like those signs in restaurant bathrooms that say "employees wash your hands before returning to work. state law."
[09:23:52] <JesseDesu> nah
[09:23:56] <Satin> it is 
[09:24:02] <Satin> my problem is just i have external monitors connected
[09:24:04] <ButterNoodle> lol
[09:24:05] <Satin> so i can't see the damm login
[09:24:08] <JesseDesu> linux boots in 5 seconds for you?
[09:24:10] <Satin> without unplugging usb-c
[09:24:12] <Satin> every single time
[09:24:14] <Satin> yeah i think so
[09:24:17] <JesseDesu> damn
[09:24:23] <Satin> the asus ROG bullshit logo takes a little time
[09:24:25] <ButterNoodle> my arch laptop gets it up in 2.5 seconds
[09:24:27] <Satin> and then from there it's a boot manager
[09:24:29] <Satin> and then linux
[09:24:30] <JesseDesu> SSD makes the difference i guess
[09:24:34] <Satin> the boot manager by default goes 1s
[09:24:47] <Satin> i don't have windows in my boot manager list right now -.-
[09:24:51] <JesseDesu> my 2012 laptop takes 2.5 minutes to boot lubuntu
[09:24:57] <Satin> only PopOS and then "Bios boot" stuff
[09:25:00] <Satin> i go to the bios

[10:20:12] <`Zephyr> Oh, I liked it too. But I don't know if it's because I liked the movie or because I finally watched something at the movies after 2 years.
[10:20:20] <`Zephyr> *I was finally
[10:20:24] <`Zephyr> *watching
[10:20:37] <mixfix41> watch antlers
[10:20:47] <BillyZane> i downloaded it
[10:21:24] <BillyZane> a lot of people said it didn't make sense
[10:21:52] <mixfix41> antlers is base on a short story you can read it here https://guernicamag.com/the-quiet-boy/

[10:22:38] <`Zephyr> Wikipedia is telling me it's a horror movie. Does it have jumpscares? I don't enjoy jumpscares.
[10:22:40] <BillyZane> i thought it made sense, it had a good plot, but the movie had a weirdly comical atmosphere to it. it's what sets it apart from it's predecessors
[10:22:59] <mixfix41> not many if you ask
[10:23:32] <mixfix41> but are you going to feel like not watching horror/thrillers all the time?
[10:24:09] <`Zephyr> I mostly do avoid the genre, yes. 
[10:25:55] <BillyZane> i've recently started doing edibles after 3 years of not getting high
[10:26:21] <BillyZane> this time, though, i'm taking it easy. but i did take a strong dose before the matrix 4
[10:28:50] <BillyZane> MootPoot, i have to say though, with regard to 'the irregular at magic high school' the bro-con imouto character is extraordinary
[10:29:27] <BillyZane> they really put their time and effort in to developing this character. everyone else, even the MC, is falling behind in character development so far
[10:31:26] <mixfix41> ill have to say i did watch that movie with a discord group. i have a hard time watching horrors if its hardcore horror like extinction that movie is pretty scary and when it comes on i know im going to get rile out of my seat
[10:33:18] <mixfix41> they can just make a scene scary like if they film it in a narrow area and openings and where the threat is coming out of a dark area at night its pretty frightening
[10:34:23] <mixfix41> antlers generally doesnt have that last part
[10:34:45] <mixfix41> i mean its scary 
[10:34:50] <mixfix41> in general though
[10:38:01] <mixfix41> horrors is nice its like plugging out of the matrix and into the real world

[14:14:06] <analoq> there appear to be a decent amount of companies who are pretty good at it
[14:14:19] <KatrinValerie> but tbh I would start from pure Aniline for those things
[14:14:24] <darkwitch> analoq, I don't know, as I have never tried, but yes there are some companies who do nothing else

[14:15:15] <analoq> darkwitch: can you smell a parfume and roughly guess what you need to get something similar?
[14:15:17] <darkwitch> the low yield from a lot of plants makes it rather expensive

[15:08:49] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Patchouli is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, commonly called the mint or deadnettle family. The plant grows as a bushy perennial herb, with erect stems reaching up to 75 centimetres in height and bearing small, pale pink-white flowers.

[15:10:26] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Nag champa is a fragrance of Indian origin. It is made from a combination of sandalwood and either champak or frangipani. When frangipani is used, the fragrance is usually referred to simply as champa.
[15:10:28] <KatrinValerie> Mint good too
[15:10:49] <mixfix41> yea these are classic iconic smells
[15:10:54] <mixfix41> patchouli pretty strong though
[15:11:07] <KatrinValerie> yeah dilution matters
[15:11:12] <darkwitch> many people dislike patchouli

[15:30:12] <KatrinValerie> analoq: pls don't even jest about this
[15:30:26] <KatrinValerie> There are people that actually believe the vaccination campaign is a mascale genocide
[15:30:43] <KatrinValerie> When the truth is that we are simply in a bit of a pickle
[15:30:54] <KatrinValerie> and we would be so fucked without the vaccine and modern medicine
[15:31:05] <analoq> i mean. if i wanted to kill lots of people then i would rather get rid of those that dont believe in vaccinations aka stupid people :D
[15:31:51] <mixfix41> yea its crazy how deadly it is
[15:31:59] <KatrinValerie> The sad thing is, these people look at systemic issues and come to the wrong conclusions
[15:32:12] <KatrinValerie> Yes the way pharma corps act is unethical
[15:32:20] <KatrinValerie> Yes patents on life saving medications are unethical
[15:32:26] <analoq> no they have a conclusion and look for things they dont understand
[15:33:00] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I don't think I know what pacholi is
[15:33:06] <KatrinValerie> I just don't get it, the infection is orders of magnitude more dangerous than the vaccine
[15:33:50] <analoq> it's the best thing that could have happened
[15:33:50] <KatrinValerie> mRNA vaccines are the safest we ever had, the data is there by now

[15:35:14] <KatrinValerie> They are still riding the ivermectine horse, even though that treatment has been seriously attempted in many places and it was dropped everywhere where people with reason are in place
[15:35:38] <KatrinValerie> The thing has been genuinly investigated and it doesn't work, yet people kling to 61 studies that show "otherwise"
[15:35:48] <analoq> its not only nice, it just so happens to solve our traffic issue, co2 output etc...
[15:35:58] <darkwitch> amigojapan, During the early 1800's, it found use as an insect repellent for keeping bugs at bay while transporting garments from Asia to the rest of the world. The scent doubled up as a mark of authenticity for genuine eastern fabrics, such as silk around the time. It became associated with high fashion and wealth - everybody wanted to smell like patchouli! In fact it was so highly valued at this point that traders would exchange a pound of 
[15:35:58] <darkwitch> patchouli for a pound of gold.
[15:36:06] <analoq> well 'solve'
[15:36:35] <KatrinValerie> darkwitch: I didn't check if the patchouli scent oil was a synthetic or the real stuff
[15:36:40] <darkwitch> It was in the 1960's and 70's however, that patchouli hit its peak popularity, some people go so far as to call it "the scent of the 60's". ‘Hippies’ used it to mask the smell of marijuana and it was a staple ingredient in some of the top selling fragrances of the time, while also being used a lot in products such as incense.
[15:37:05] <KatrinValerie> darkwitch: How dare those hippies
[15:37:16] <KatrinValerie> I frigging love the smell of cannabis 
[15:37:34] <KatrinValerie> Normalise cannabis terpenes as perfume!
[15:37:41] <darkwitch> I guess it also masked the smell of not washing themselves
[15:38:16] <KatrinValerie> darkwitch: Didn't hippies do like lots of nude bathing?

[16:45:48] <ezekielnoob> Sadale we bought a smoke machine
[16:45:53] <ezekielnoob> it was cheap like $40
[16:45:57] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, dafaq is that? :O
[16:46:01] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, link please :3
[16:46:02] <KatrinValerie> I can make smoke for cheaper
[16:46:05] <Sadale> or pic. or whatever
[16:46:05] <KatrinValerie> lol
[16:46:17] <ezekielnoob> a fog machine
[16:46:20] <ezekielnoob> for disinfacting
[16:46:21] <Sadale> TIL there's a dedicated smoke machine for filming
[16:46:31] <Sadale> oh. It isn't for filming. It's for disinfecting.
[16:46:37] <ezekielnoob> yeah
[16:46:41] <ezekielnoob> well they do both :D
[16:46:47] <KatrinValerie> that sounds like a bad idea
[16:46:52] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, That's an interesting alternative use of a disinfection machine xD
[16:46:55] <ezekielnoob> because the solution we put in is for disinfection
[16:46:59] <KatrinValerie> you'll be breathing airborne disinfectant
[16:47:02] <ezekielnoob> they say it's fine to use for video
[16:47:16] <ezekielnoob> we did research it and this is the same thing they use for night clubs
[16:47:33] <ezekielnoob> i think we can use different oils
[16:47:43] <ezekielnoob> maybe something even less specific for disinfection
[16:47:50] <ezekielnoob> ideally just water
[16:48:19] <KatrinValerie> ezekielnoob: the issue is that most of these things aren't good when inhaled
[16:48:29] <KatrinValerie> If you want to disinfect air, there are better ways.
[16:48:57] <KatrinValerie> a closed box with a UV light and a ventilator is much more effective and secure
[16:48:58] <Sadale> no worries. It's the cosplayer who'd be inhalting the most disinfection liquid :P
[16:49:15] <Sadale> ezekielnoob the photographer is far away enough to be safe. At least he's safer than the cosplayer :D

[16:49:37] <amigojapan> I had dinner
[16:49:54] <KatrinValerie> Also they usually use glycerin in smoke machines at the disco

[16:50:38] <ezekielnoob> alright im gonna research if i can use that instead, i hope i can just use water tho lol
[16:50:46] <ezekielnoob> cause it does cost money to buy the disinfectatnt
[16:50:46] <Sadale> lol and water's even cheaper
[16:50:51] <KatrinValerie> it's the main ingridient of e-cig liquid as well, when used like that it is not completely harmless
[16:51:02] <ezekielnoob> i just don't know if plain water is gonna fog the same way
[16:51:04] <Sadale> Maybe you could use cum for lulz
[16:51:14] <ezekielnoob> that's gonna be stanky
[16:51:17] <Sadale> lol
[16:51:21] <ezekielnoob> gonna smell like bleach
[16:51:32] <KatrinValerie> ezekielnoob: if you have a smoke machine that can take water, you will have to add an additive to the water that keeps growth out but does not evaporate
[16:51:54] <KatrinValerie> or just regularily clean it and replace the water
[16:52:25] <ezekielnoob> oh that's a fair point
[16:52:34] <ezekielnoob> i wonder how do i clean this thing

[17:05:04] <davic> Terminus: yes
[17:05:13] <davic> Terminus: gf's mom got hit but she ok
[17:05:33] <Terminus> but yeah, i was watching the videos from cebu the day after. windows in buildings exploding from the pressure differential.
[17:06:02] <davic> ye
[17:06:11] <davic> still no power and water and internet in some places
[17:06:21] <davic> Terminus: but tldr, dont have a steel roof
[17:06:35] <Terminus> i was talking to my parents the night of the storm. we got cut off from the video call because power died in the middle. we reconnected via good old GSM and we were talking while they were looking for flashlights.
[17:06:59] <davic> Terminus: ah shit, they live there?
[17:07:02] <davic> they ok?
[17:08:04] <mixfix41> neoweather says us is experiences mild el nina for a second year
[17:08:10] <Terminus> davic: i wouldn't say that. i'd say more like engineer it properly. steel roofs can survive if you engineer the entire structure properly taking into account pressure, etc. that said, it was a strong typhoon and even the best engineering can still fall to it.
[17:08:18] <mixfix41> im not sure if it applies to other parts of the world ocean temps
[17:08:54] <KatrinValerie> davic: don't spoil my fun fantasies pls
[17:09:11] <Terminus> davic: they're in bacolod. they're fine. just three roof panels got torn off. i saw photos of a friend's house in cebu though. almost completely torn apart. they were hiding in a closet at the height of the storm.
[17:10:32] <sentionics> well, alright alright alright
[17:10:42] <davic> Terminus: ah yeah, gf's mom is in Leyte
[17:10:42] <Terminus> i'm leaning towards it's better to leave windows open and get a bit wet in a strong storm. at least your roof won't fly off and windows won't get shattered.
[17:11:05] <sentionics> davic, Terminus, mates! how are ya'll? mixfix41!!
[17:11:22] <Terminus> ah... leyte. now that's a place with a very different situation. you have to basically be prepared for strong typhoons there every year.
[17:11:33] <sentionics> man it's a new year ya'll, I ain't ready for this 2022 shit.
[17:11:48] <Terminus> i think leyte fared better than dinagat, siargao, bohol, and cebu for this typhoon.

[23:34:35] <Satin> I don't use AWS or SSH and someone else here might have a better suggestion
[23:34:41] <Satin> but for me you use any good terminal program
[23:34:45] <Satin> and then launch into those things
[23:35:01] <Satin> any terminal program that has tabs*
[23:35:08] <MootPoot> all I have installed right now is that Konsole plasma app, and that normal Xfce4 termianl app
[23:35:09] <MootPoot> thats it
[23:35:11] <Satin> linux terminals can do almost anything
[23:35:13] <Satin> hmmm
[23:36:32] <Satin> I haven't use konsole in ages
[23:36:39] <Satin> but the xfce terminal app can do multiple tabs for sure
[23:36:40] <Satin> if you'
[23:37:05] * MootPoot ran like 10 backups yesterday after he got everything working
[23:37:34] <Sapphirus> why tabs when you can tmux
[23:37:38] <Satin> I see https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#tabs-and-windows
[23:37:38] <ImoutoBot> [title] Overview - kitty
[23:37:54] <Satin> Sapphirus: He'll get to that eventually, Idk if it's a good idea to have someone just learn tmux all of a sudden
[23:37:56] <emmeka> MootPoot xfce terminal does tabs. Just go file->open tab
[23:38:24] <mixfix41> actually xterm even does
[23:38:28] <emmeka> there's probably some shortcut way to do this that I don't know because I am pleb
[23:38:29] <Satin> MootPoot: but my honest suggestion is to do a CLI oriented app like kitty and do its tabs
[23:38:36] <Satin> my bias but y'know
[23:38:42] <Satin> kitty's so good :3
[23:38:49] <MootPoot> I did tmux but it was like using vi for the first time
[23:38:51] <mixfix41> it depends on the window manager but generally say fluxbox, if you hold control you can merge them
[23:38:52] <MootPoot> panick
[23:39:32] <mixfix41> so if you want to center your work flow around _that_ it might be possibru, ive learnt it by accident never _really_ choose to use it..
[23:39:45] <Satin> go with kitty for now!! you can just move around in a window with multiple tabs with CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT or RIGHT
[23:39:53] <MootPoot> kitty it is
[23:39:56] <MootPoot> I like pussy
[23:39:57] <Satin> and start new tabs with CTRL + SHIFT + T
[23:40:09] <MootPoot> also - one other thing with kitty
[23:40:21] <MootPoot> when you ctrl+v does it directly paste into the terminal
[23:40:22] <Satin> XFCEterminal and plasma konsole aren't bad but they're for sure basic versus alacritty or kitty
[23:40:30] <MootPoot> rather then having that stupid popup
[23:40:32] <Satin> alacritty doesn't support multiple tabs and panes though
[23:40:33] <Satin> kitty does
[23:40:36] <MootPoot> pog
[23:40:45] <Satin> yes
[23:40:53] <Satin> but you can disable that popup in xfceterminal to be fair
[23:40:54] <Satin> but yeah
[23:41:00] <Satin> generally when you paste into terminals 
[23:41:06] <Satin> you do CTRL+SHIFT+V
[23:41:10] <Satin> i hate that shit but it's just what it is
[23:41:27] <Satin> same for copying
[23:41:39] <Satin> it clashes with very generic linux commands, CTRL + C stops a process or something i can't remember
[23:41:41] <Sapphirus> alacritty is based.
[23:41:51] <Satin> so whenever you're in terminals you use CTRL + SHIFT + C or CTRL + SHIFT + V
[23:41:53] <Sapphirus> Far better than kitty imho
[23:41:57] <Satin> and i fucking hate that
[23:42:03] <Satin> because i do it in firefox randomly
[23:42:06] <Satin> when i switch windows
[23:42:10] <Sapphirus> Author of kitty has a stupid bias against bitmap fonts
[23:42:11] <Satin> and open up inspect element
[23:42:16] <Satin> Sapphirus:  smh
[23:42:31] * Satin still goes with the terminal that has pane support adn properly supports ranger :p
[23:42:48] <Satin> the author of kitty is also the author of calibre
[23:42:50] <emmeka> whenever I need to paste in terminal I just go edit->paste
[23:42:53] <Sapphirus> What are you talking about? I'm using ranger with alacritty.

[23:45:56] <Roey> I liked JED with emacs keybindings, for example.
[23:45:58] <Satin> MootPoot: I'm as clueless as you but in general what I've found is emacs is its own giant program, which can do all sorts of things and has supports for all sorts of things thanks to plugins written in LISP
[23:46:08] <mixfix41> except emacs is on windows
[23:46:08] <Satin> MootPoot: and by anything i mean anything
[23:46:17] <emmeka> MootPoot emacs is just a very complicated and customizeable text editor. You can extend it to do basically everything. It requires learning.
[23:46:18] <Satin> people can invest into the emacs universe if you will and that's everything
[23:46:20] <Roey> mixfix41: sure
[23:46:28] <MootPoot> emmeka: more then vi?
[23:46:31] <Satin> MootPoot: in comparison vi/vim are "modal text editors"
[23:46:35] <mixfix41> emacs and vivaldi makes it _that_ much better
[23:46:36] <emmeka> you've asked a dangerous question
[23:46:41] <MootPoot> oh no
[23:46:50] <MootPoot> good thing urchin isen't here
[23:47:03] <emmeka> vi vs emacs is the oldest struggle in unixland
[23:47:09] <mixfix41> emacs and msys ^^
[23:47:16] <Satin> but in any case Sapphirus, alacritty doesn't properly have something like kitty's panes
[23:47:27] <Sapphirus> tmux works just fine
[23:47:30] <Satin> it doesn't have split tabs or anything like that
[23:47:31] <Satin> yeah ok
[23:47:33] <Sapphirus> Kitty's panes look ugly
[23:47:34] <MootPoot> emmeka: what if I said I used nano
[23:47:35] <Satin> no
[23:47:36] <Satin> wrong
[23:47:38] <MootPoot> :3
[23:47:39] <emmeka> MootPoot same.
[23:47:54] <emmeka> most linux users: vi! emacs! me: I can kind of sort of use nano?
[23:48:06] <Sapphirus> Satin, yes, they are ugly. Terminal multiplexers are portable :D
[23:48:07] <Satin> "A modal text editor is a, nowadays rare, text editor that offers multiple interaction modes which are optimized for specific types of action and interaction. The rationale is that each mode is a finely-tuned tool which allows the user to realize their objectives in an efficient and powerful manner."
[23:48:10] <emmeka> just accept your nature as a pleb
[23:48:13] <Satin> Sapphirus: ..................
[23:48:26] <Satin> MootPoot: so vi/vim works with different "modes"
[23:48:33] <Satin> it's a text editor at heart
[23:48:37] <Sapphirus> Kitty's author is also a snob, so there's also that.
[23:48:49] <Satin> Sapphirus: about what, terminal standards? :P
[23:48:54] <Satin> he's doing work to help the ecosystem /shrug
[23:48:59] <MootPoot> butter told me if I use nano I might as well use visual studio code
[23:49:01] <MootPoot> lol
[23:49:05] <Satin> MootPoot: lolololo
[23:49:07] <Sapphirus> Satin, nah, about font types.
[23:49:09] <Satin> MootPoot: just learn vi/vim
[23:49:10] <mixfix41> im no brillant mind. i had a phase. EDITOR=nano;sudo visudo
[23:49:13] <Satin> Sapphirus: i see
[23:49:22] <Sapphirus> It's completely irrational, too.
[23:49:28] <Satin> Damm.
[23:49:32] <MootPoot> Satin: I can use it enough to make edits and shit
[23:49:33] <MootPoot> its just
[23:49:35] <emmeka> I'm actually even more of a pleb. 90% of the time, if I have to edit a text file, I just open it up in xfce mousepad...
[23:49:37] <Sapphirus> Alacritty does the same type of font scaling and has no trouble supporting bitmap fonts.
[23:49:41] <MootPoot> :wq makes no sense to me
