[01:33:07] <somiaj> Wonder if sending a refresh event would have also caused the window to finally close down.
[01:33:19] *** Joins: redgloboli (~redglobol@user/redgloboli)
[01:34:14] <somiaj> since the process gets in some crashed state, it might not be sending an event to x11 to know that the window's process has died and thus the window sticks around until some event in which x11 is forced to notice that the process is died so it kills the extranous window

[02:14:18] <pflanze> Hi. Is it possible to dist-upgrade two releases at once (from stretch to bullseye)? I'm on a slow machine (raspberry pi) and it's a pain to do each single upgrade.
[02:14:55] *** Quits: marvka (~marvka@146.70.61.147) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:15:06] <n4dir> pflanze: in general a bit No
[02:15:34] <n4dir> a big even, not a bit
[02:15:59] <n4dir> why does it mind you if it takes long?
[02:16:13] <sney> if you have a long way to go, it may be wiser to back up your data and do a fresh install instead
[02:17:27] <pflanze> n4dir, for one because it still stops to ask questions in the middle of it (the "maintainers or your file, diff yes no" stuff, I hate it).
[02:17:42] <n4dir> i once had to upgrade two releases at once, on a powerpc, because the release in the middle was simply not there. But still, no. And of course what sney said
[02:17:59] <pflanze> But also because I need to go to bed soon and was hoping to pack up that thing soon tomorrow, but if it takes another 5 hours tomorrow to do the second upgrade it's too late.
[02:18:23] <n4dir> then what sney said
[02:18:32] <pflanze> Even then it asks those questions.
[02:20:32] <n4dir> i don't recall upgrades on the raspberry taking 5 hours.
[02:20:48] <pflanze> I've installed lots of additional stuff.
[02:21:07] <PMT> "too late" for what?
[02:21:08] <pflanze> Maybe it was just (3-)4 hours last time but it was long.
[02:21:27] <n4dir> it sure is so long that it sucks. Not discussing that .
[02:21:29] <pflanze> The time between me getting up and me having to leave is less than 3 hours.
[02:21:47] <Blondie101010> your choice is probably to wait patiently until it finishes or mess with it and it takes longer
[02:21:53] <n4dir> and you sure need to upgrade?
[02:21:53] <pflanze> I guess I simply won't upgrade at all, bummer, have to get along with it.
[02:22:28] <pflanze> Blondie101010, yeah that's why I'm asking, out of such fear :)
[02:22:36] <Blondie101010> lack of time and patience forces you to be a bad sysadmin

[11:54:40] <jelly> I don't think it's been +r since May the whole time
[11:56:17] <OzFalcon> Is freenode/debian still around or has LibraChat/debian taken it's place?
[11:56:33] <Haohmaru> !freenode
[11:56:33] <dpkg> freenode is no longer a recommended IRC network for Debian support. https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2021/06/msg00002.html , or see <debian irc>. If you can't find the new IRC home of a project, try looking at https://github.com/siraben/freenode-exodus
[11:56:52] <OzFalcon> Yup
[11:57:41] <jelly> OzFalcon: it's hard to say what's still around on freenode, if there's a #debian it's not in any official or semi-official capacity
[11:58:46] <jelly> irc.oftc.net is Debian project's official network, that's where irc.debian.org points to and that's where the largest and most officialest #debian resides
[11:59:28] <Haohmaru> however, libera has a ton of debian users too, thus this channel exists due to the need
[11:59:40] <OzFalcon> Another project moved here. So it's convenient to have #debian here.
[12:03:01] <Seng> I really wanted to like freenode, and thought Libera was just trying to disrupt using some really shady tactics, but then freenode started doing funky stuff, and my nickserv for example got removed, channels disappeared.. it's a mess.
[12:03:27] <Seng> luckily IRC is made awesome by the people on it, not the servers running the software :)
[12:03:38] <Haohmaru> freenode was until may, after that it became "freenope"
[12:04:03] <OzFalcon> Now that I'm here, Maybe someone knowledgeable about dpkg-buildpackage can help me. Like it's failing & I'm not sure how to work out whats wrong. ie. logs or whatnot.
[12:04:07] <Haohmaru> we here are basically the same old people from before may
[12:04:18] <Haohmaru> some with slightly different nicknames tho
[12:04:42] <OzFalcon> Seng, Ah thats probably why my login just stopped working.
[12:04:54] <OzFalcon> (For freenode)
[12:06:38] <PMT> everybody's got deleted.
[12:08:00] <Haohmaru> nah, they replaced the servers with other servers and used different services (thus blank nickname/channel database on it)
[12:08:08] <Haohmaru> the old ones were simply stopped

[14:04:59] <Khepra> "bullseye-updates, previously known as 'volatile'"   now there's a sources.list that's been sed'ed for years :)
[14:05:36] <rendar> i didn't write that comment
[14:06:08] <rendar> why updates haven't 'contrib' ?
[14:06:48] <PMT> They...do? I don't understand the question.

[14:07:13] <rendar> Khepra, and should i?
[14:07:22] <Khepra> !bullseye sources.list
[14:07:22] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for "Bullseye" has three lines: "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main". See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-updates> and `man sources.list`.
[14:07:26] <PMT> Do you want the packages from contrib?
[14:07:41] <Khepra> bah, that factoid doesn't list contrib.  yes, if you want non-free you might need contrib too
[14:07:51] <rendar> ok
[14:07:55] <rendar> what is contrib exactly?

[14:10:32] <rendar> any suggestions? should i add something?
[14:10:40] <jelly> that's just standard repos for bullseye with non-free stuff
[14:10:54] <n4dir> you can probably comment or remove deb-src lines
[14:10:57] <Khepra> plus, I'd comment out deb-src if you're not using source debs
[14:11:03] <jelly> that's sufficient to install firmware
[14:11:23] <rendar> i see, thanks
[14:11:44] <OzFalcon> Problem SOLVED for dpkg-buildpackage. The build just completed successfully. Looks like dpkg-buildpackage doesn't like certain filepaths. (Likely the (parentheses) I had in the filepath)
[14:11:46] <rendar> but, how can i know that some package is using source debs?
[14:11:57] <Khepra> ,i i915/kbl_dmc_ver1_04.bin
[14:11:58] <judd> No package named 'i915/kbl_dmc_ver1_04.bin' was found in bullseye/amd64.
[14:12:17] <rendar> ?
[14:12:30] <Khepra> judd doesn't check non-free it seems..  you need firmware-misc-nonfree
[14:12:34] <PMT> if you don't know what source code is, you're not using source debs.
[14:12:56] <rendar> :(
[14:13:05] <PMT> Khepra: no, it's just that you searched package names for a filename, I think.
[14:13:09] <n4dir> worded very vaguely: deb-src is to compile yourself from source
[14:13:11] <PMT> ,file i915/kbl_dmc_ver1_04.bin
[14:13:13] <judd> No packages in bullseye/amd64 were found with that file.
[14:13:21] <Khepra> rendar: deb-src is  for using `apt source`   where you install the .deb as a local file, unpacked into a dir, for optional modification of the source, and building a package locally
[14:13:25] <rendar> can't i just blacklist this dmc driver?
[14:13:51] <Khepra> rendar: aren't you using the iGPU ?
[14:14:03] <n4dir> Khepra: or you try to backport something yourself from, usually, sid/unstable
[14:14:05] <OzFalcon> locate kbl_dmc ---> /lib/firmware/i915/kbl_dmc_ver1.bin /lib/firmware/i915/kbl_dmc_ver1_01.bin /lib/firmware/i915/kbl_dmc_ver1_04.bin
[14:14:39] <Khepra> n4dir: yes, that follows
[14:15:00] <rendar> ok, so, what is the best and less intrusive solution to get this kbl_dmc_ver1_04.bin?
[14:15:08] <PMT> I wonder if it's that problem with "all" packages not getting proper file lists...
[14:15:14] <jelly> judd: file kbl_dmc_ver1_04.bin
[14:15:16] <judd> No packages in bullseye/amd64 were found with that file.
[14:15:17] <n4dir> as long he understands why (usually, often, something-like-that) deb-src can at least be commented, i guess we are fine :-)
[14:15:28] <OzFalcon> rendar, It's in one of the standard packages. One moment I'll just check.

[17:00:16] <Khepra> my point here is conflating "trusted" with "official" and "that software is not vulnerable"

[17:00:46] <XJ8> What are the plans to drop GTK2 from debian? Would bookworm or trixie be the one that there is no GTK2 or any GTK2 programs in the repos?
[17:01:00] <^-^hi> But when I am X forwarding I got to worry about stuff I don't know how to fix.
[17:01:24] <Khepra> precisely. the correct question is:  I don't trust ANY software, official repos or not. WHAT can I do to limit its effect in case there's an exploited vulnerability.
[17:02:14] <Khepra> so you run xorg as rootless (better even you don't run xorg at all, use a wayland compositor if you can); you run programs with elevated security constraints (namespaces, permissions, mandatory access control, ...),  and do many other things to reduce the attack surface.
[17:02:51] <Khepra> if you're concerned about security, the only question is you should ask is:  how to I limit the attack surface of it. how do I contain the fallout in worst possible cases.
[17:03:01] <Khepra> how *do
[17:03:52] <Khepra> (it's also quite okay to not care about any of this, but you started asking security centric questions, and I wanted to point at the fallacies in those questions)

[19:46:22] <XJ8> Because nvidia drivers aren't in the kernel, would that mean that preferring nvidia over AMD be more well... preferable because then I won't be limited to cards because of my kernel version?

[19:57:48] <Khepra> could be both
[19:58:01] <PerfDave> Yep
[19:58:50] <PerfDave> Trouble is I don't know where to start looking. Something like a benchmark suite which tests different graphics operations (shaders etc.) to find where it's particularly slow would help.
[19:58:56] <Khepra> software plays a huge role. debian simply isn't for gaming. it's too generic. virtue in one way, but flaw for gaming that requires latest and greatest

[19:59:57] <Khepra> I had terrible performance on debian, with my amdgpu. also glitchy. I upgraded mesa, and libdrm, and libvulkan, and kernel to upstream's latest, and pulled in latest kernel.org firmware.   that fixed glitches, but improved performance only marginally.

[20:00:48] *** Joins: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua)
[20:00:52] <Khepra> then I build gentoo on that machine, and performance shot up. I _assume_ custom compilation for _some_ packages is the key, due to march=native build I used for gentoo. I just have to figure out what those are on debian without building everything
[20:01:14] *** Joins: rob-z (~rob@2001:980:9cbb:1::1)
[20:02:00] <Khepra> this is my assumption based on other situations where that IS the case. for example on our production servers, we build Python Pillow with march=native and that gives up approx 30% improvement over stock built, march=generic, Pillow
[20:02:37] <Khepra> so multimedia apps, or apps that can benefit from simd and vectorization in data transfer, will benefit from march=native if your CPU can offer all those things

[20:03:47] <Khepra> also, surprisingly, mesa on debian builds with -O1 due to a long gone bug, and I even patched that out
[20:04:21] <rendar> Khepra, do you think it's possible to compile some packages in debian? e.g. can i say apt-get build those packages with march=native?
[20:04:42] <Khepra> of course, I just described I did that for mesa, libdrm, vulkan
[20:04:58] <Khepra> !ssb
[20:04:58] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[20:05:19] <Khepra> you can build src debs from stable too, not just from sid.
[20:05:54] <Khepra> you can set CFLAGS via ~/.config/dpkg/buildflags.conf  ;  also see dpkg-buildflags(1) for more options

[23:33:19] <kittonian> hi all. is anyone familiar with running fail2ban with postfix? i have it all up and running, but i can't get it to send e-mail notifications. postfix is running inside a docker container. I'm already in the postfix channel but no one seems to know how to make this work, so i thought i'd ask here.

[23:34:16] <fatal> that is pretty much all there is concerning i3-wm

[23:37:16] <fatal> other interesting things to look into if you start with a tiling wm is probably feh, xev and xprop.
[23:38:27] <fatal> and maybe xrandr if you use more than one monitor.
