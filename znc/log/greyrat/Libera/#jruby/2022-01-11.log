[00:39:01] <headius> ok I got test:jruby to complete by excluding three socket-related tests
[00:39:01] <headius> on M1
[00:39:04] <headius> 1096 tests, 76033 assertions, 0 failures, 6 errors, 1 pendings, 1 omissions, 0 notifications
[00:40:44] <headius> of those six errors, one is a known problem with this suite running as an administrator (expects a permission error) and the other five are unexpected file permission errors
[00:41:03] <headius> I'm going to run this with x86 and see how that compares... some of this might be altered security on newer MacOS
[00:43:23] <headius> yup, same errors on an x86 run
[00:43:29] <headius> that is great news
[00:43:52] <headius> I think these might be due to different umask on MacOS
[00:43:53] <headius> enebo: what's your umask
[00:44:38] <enebo[m]> 0022
[00:45:47] <headius> hmmm same here
[00:46:06] <headius> well at least it is equally broken on M1 and x86
[00:46:43] <headius> enebo: hmm I wonder if the same excludes hang on x86
[00:55:30] <headius> nope no hangs
[00:55:41] <headius> so there's some marching orders here to fix
[00:55:53] <headius> I will attach this work to my GHA PR
[01:05:29] <headius> ah at least rubyspec/language is green so far
[01:06:42] <headius> enebo: I will look into the different failures on arm64 and newer macos but we might want to consider using the exclude system for JRuby tests or deleting those tests in favor of specs that cover the same
[01:07:11] <headius> we have a handful of things excluded by platform, usually manually with "if WINDOWS\ndef test_blah" kinds of gross excluding
[01:08:03] <enebo[m]> I am in favor of anything which reduces our tests too but that I guess is different.  I don't have any issues with using excludes though
[01:08:28] <headius> hmm yeah probably best to find or write equivalent specs
[01:08:31] <headius> so we can exclude using tags
[01:08:43] <headius> there's very little in test:jruby that is jruby-specific
[01:08:50] <headius> mostly JI that should be in JI specs

[23:34:22] <headius> enebo: is this still broken? No updates in a couple weeks
[23:34:22] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6980
[23:35:09] <enebo[m]> headius: good question but I marked it just in case
[23:35:28] <enebo[m]> I am working a lot on kwargs so I suspect I will not have many issues fixing it if it is still broken
[23:35:51] <headius> Yeah that's what I figured
[23:35:51] <enebo[m]> I also marked another issue on files with more than 32k lines overflowing
[23:36:08] <headius> Just saw that
[23:36:24] <enebo[m]> I only have 3 errors in spec with kwargs on master and 2 are warns
[23:36:27] <headius> We need qubits
[23:36:36] <enebo[m]> this last one is annoying though
[23:36:53] <enebo[m]> I am super close
[23:37:31] <headius> Next week for 9.3.3 should be fine. Not many failures on M1 and I am looking into them but some fail with x86 also
[23:37:50] <enebo[m]> ok good.  yeah the two I marked will not be difficult or risky
[23:38:14] <enebo[m]> M1 is the main issue for risk I guess but not too risky since it is not working too great for 9.3.2
[23:38:33] <headius> Seems like most issues coming in are 9.3 so that's good
[23:39:06] <headius> Yeah it is mostly additive, small risk in some shared code but the actual patches were small
[23:39:57] <enebo[m]> cool.  It hopefully will be pretty solid after this release :)
[23:40:01] <enebo[m]> it == 9.3
