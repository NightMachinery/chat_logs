[16:22:53] <SteppenwolfVM> yes when i was little, with my mom
[16:23:06] <murthy> Nice
[16:23:27] <SteppenwolfVM> we went to Haidakhan and Chiliano
[16:23:28] <murthy> Ya I am hoping for a complete ban of fireworks in two years
[16:23:44] <SteppenwolfVM> and before those stayed at new delhi
[16:24:01] <SteppenwolfVM> i too hope fireworks will be banned here in germany and everywhere
[16:24:05] <murthy> I think I remember you telling me about Haidakhan
[16:24:25] <murthy> Nice
[16:24:35] <SteppenwolfVM> oops
[16:24:40] <SteppenwolfVM> i meant Chilianola
[16:24:44] <SteppenwolfVM> not Chiliano lol
[16:24:58] <murthy> :)
[16:25:31] <SteppenwolfVM> Chilianola was very interesting, there was a school there, and the indian kids were very proud to be at this school
[16:25:42] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: Do you know that Hash in #music does guitar freestyles very nicely?
[16:25:44] <SteppenwolfVM> they tried to convince me to go to the school with them
[16:26:10] <SteppenwolfVM> but i was used to daily school visits in germany and was so happy to be away from the school lessons back then lol

[16:26:42] <SteppenwolfVM> not yet, i rarely talk to Hash as we had our differences about ...hash consumption lol
[16:27:05] <murthy> Oh yes. He is a complex person
[16:27:08] <louipc> i hope fireworks will be unlimited
[16:28:52] <murthy> Those drugs stuff, trolling and emotional outbreaks aside, he plays guitar well. If you had talked to him earlier. He is Indian and also follows some swamy
[16:29:12] <SteppenwolfVM> oh nice
[16:29:23] <SteppenwolfVM> i didn't know that
[16:29:47] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: Did you or mom go to some temple on Diwali?
[16:29:49] <SteppenwolfVM> i wonder if i possibly meat him in an german ashram now
[16:30:10] <murthy> He is in US
[16:30:21] <SteppenwolfVM> we were at either Haidakhan or Chilianola back then, i don't rember, but it was quite an big event
[16:30:30] <SteppenwolfVM> i mean i was little, i surely missed half of the fun
[16:30:58] <SteppenwolfVM> there were lots of spiritual events, food for the entire village and more

[20:03:01] <artao> Session is only the 2nd time i've bought into early access
[20:03:34] <artao> that video, 0:26
[20:03:37] <artao> HOLY FUCK!! :O
[20:04:33] <artao> DOMF so youu have skater xl then?
[20:05:02] *** Joins: nativetexan (~nativetex@user/nativetexan)
[20:05:14] <artao> i like the "concept" in Session: Each stick controls a foot. Left is left foot, right is right. Turn with the triggers.
[20:05:38] <artao> to ollie (regular foot) you pull the right stick back then pop the left stick forward and release
[20:05:58] <artao> to kickflip you do the same, but push the left stick left. heelflip to the right
[20:06:16] <artao> late flips you do an ollile like normal, the use either foot to flip the board
[20:06:39] <artao> OH! you can also, when kickflipping, push the left stick forward and the right stick to the left to do a rear foot kickflip
[20:07:18] <artao> a pop shove-it you do ollie as normal, but "scoop" either stick either 90 or 180 degrees to do a 180 or 360 shove-it
[20:07:33] <artao> basically, you use the sticks just like you'd use your feet. mostly
[20:07:44] <artao> you can even do half-flip underflip
[20:07:51] <artao> but no straight underflip (yet)
[20:09:07] <artao> you can also set the control scheme to skater xl (left stick is front foot right stick is rear) or skate 3 (IDK. but you can't do a bunch of the tricks in this mode cuz of how it is)
[20:09:29] <artao> i'm thinking of trying the front/back foot scheme, cuz i kinda keep getting confused when skating switch/fakie
[20:09:30] <artao> SAY!
[20:09:31] <artao> DOMF
[20:09:39] <artao> thoughts on "switch nollie"?
[20:09:50] <artao> i've been told there is no such thing. it's a fakie ollie
[20:10:04] <artao> even if you do your entire run switch
[20:10:13] <artao> that makes no sense to me
[20:10:40] <artao> well ... with modern popsicle boards, there's really no difference to be fair
[20:10:46] <artao> can't tell between switch and fakie
[20:10:58] <artao> old decks tho, that actually have different nose and tail?
[20:11:05] <artao> you nollie on the nose and ollie on the tail
[20:11:39] <artao> which means there's both a visual and technical difference between switch nollie and fakie ollie
[20:13:02] <artao> moving on
[20:13:05] <artao> fun track!

[23:17:12] <artao> die from a heart attack while fapping
[23:17:20] <artao> how fucking embarassing would THAT be eh?
[23:17:41] <artao> sitting here, dead, with a sex toy on my lap and porn on both monitors
[23:17:58] <artao> for the people who found me, of course. not me
[23:18:01] <artao> i'm dead there
[23:18:08] <artao> you can't be embarassed when dead
[23:18:34] <Panther> Dying with a rope around your neck too while using asphyxiation to increase sexual pleasure.
[23:18:35] <artao> ~17:30 in that vid
[23:18:36] <artao> check it
[23:18:50] <artao> an F-14 Tomcat goes up direct against the star destroyer
[23:18:52] <artao> LMAO right
[23:19:06] <artao> that too Panther. that too
[23:19:12] <artao> long live grasshopper
[23:19:13] <artao> lol

[23:19:26] <artao> David Carradine
[23:19:31] <artao> RIP you dumbass
[23:19:53] <artao> i don't understand AeA
[23:19:53] <Panther> "When the student is ready, the master will appear."
[23:19:54] <artao> why?
[23:20:06] <artao> you're so bored with "normal" stuff?
[23:20:09] * artao shrugs
[23:20:13] <artao> to each there own, but DAYUM
[23:20:22] <artao> risking your life with such immediacy?

[23:20:27] <artao> there's a death wish there
[23:20:40] <artao> i mean ... gloryholes are super dangerous too
[23:20:42] <Panther> Like when I take my bike out :)
[23:20:49] <artao> but not with that sort of "death wish" immediacy
[23:21:00] <Panther> I will do anything to avoid having to stop.
[23:21:12] <artao> i don't follow
[23:21:23] <artao> to avoid having to stop taking your bike out?
[23:21:31] <artao> is "take your bike out" a euphemism?
[23:21:34] <artao> hehe ;)
[23:22:05] <Panther> Go against traffic, jump curbs, jump tree roots, ride in the middle lanes, cut across highways, rids on pplz lawns, etc....
[23:22:43] <Panther> You have like 1 second to make up your mind when I am coiming, or I make it up for you. :)
[23:22:53] <Panther> Oddly, I was only hit 3 times last year.
[23:23:32] <artao> YAY
[23:23:34] <artao> wait ... no
[23:23:45] <artao> jump curbs and tree roots? YAY
[23:23:50] <artao> the rest ... :O
[23:23:52] <artao> :( no
[23:23:55] <artao> plz no
[23:24:01] <artao> gives bikers a bad rep man
[23:24:05] <artao> use signals too
[23:24:33] <artao> tho these days it's so rare that bikers use hand turn signals that drivers think you're waving at them
[23:24:34] <artao> LOL
[23:24:40] <artao> so use a fist, not open hand
[23:25:05] <artao> no real need to use stop. just get your ass over by the curb
[23:25:21] <artao> obey rules at stop signs ........ unless there's no traffic
[23:25:42] <artao> i.e. proper right of way rules
[23:29:03] <artao> i beg of all you bikers. pretty please do so
[23:29:04] <artao> morlog
[23:29:16] <artao> perhaps you already do. you seem like the sort of chap who does :D
[23:29:27] <artao> LOL
[23:29:51] <artao> dude is fireing fucking AA and ATG missiles at the engine bells of the star destroyerer
[23:29:56] <artao> that's just .... no
[23:30:03] <artao> those are DESIGNED to contain explosions
[23:30:08] <artao> specifically
[23:30:18] <artao> a rocket engine is nothing more than a controlled explosion
[23:30:39] <artao> the flames coming out of the end are just exhaust. wasted energy
[23:30:49] <artao> all the thrust happens within the engine bell
[23:31:07] <artao> which is why it has to be so specifically shaped
[23:31:49] <artao> welll ... not "so specifically" i guess
[23:31:54] <artao> a simple cone works
[23:32:00] <artao> terribly inefficient tho
[23:32:19] <artao> nozzle and bell shape ARE focket physics
[23:32:31] <artao> and pumps and mixing chambers and preheaters and coolers
[23:32:38] <artao> and plumbing
[23:32:44] <artao> LOTS AND LOTS of plumbing
[23:33:27] <artao> Arguably, rocket science is largely largely about plumbing. Prove me wrong.
