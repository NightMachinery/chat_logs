[15:16:00] <edgar-rft> in real-world programming you try to abstract the low-level stuff to save typing in the real code what is called "bottom-up" programming,  the you try to abstract the problem you want to solve into logical units what is called "top-down" programming.

[16:14:11] <Decker> scrap it and start again
[16:14:56] <CoderGuy> Here's the flaw we have a div if you will a panel [Panel]  and said panel expands via the Width of all contents inside it, problem is say you want to move something inside the panel over a bit so Left:20px;  well the panel won't expand in size
[16:15:34] <CoderGuy> Now I like that the panel grows based on the contents inside it...but uhh now it won't grow, sooo what do you do?

[16:17:26] <CoderGuy> but the general rule of what to do will give me a solution
[16:18:00] <CoderGuy> so the intended behaviour is "if you move something, don't adjust the size of the panel" that's how it was built...but what should I do?

[16:32:26] <beaky> so zippers are the derivative of data for example a list is 1 + a*x its derivative with respect to x is a thus the use of [a] as the list zipper likewise trees are 1 + a*x*x and the derivative with respect to x is 2*a*x and the 2 represents the choice of different branch in the zipper, how far does the idea of zipper as derivative generalize to things like directed acyclic graphs or full

[16:32:54] <CoderGuy> I guess that is what the style elements are doing to begin with right?

[16:52:34] <RedNifre> It's more a different slicing of double entry accounting. In double entry accounting, you view things from the perspective of accounts (one book per account) and when you credit one account, you add a double transaction in another account to debit it and that needs to add up to zero. I think of it more from the perspective of the transaction, as in one transaction connects 2 or more accounts
[16:52:36] <RedNifre> and the FROMs and TOs of the transaction need to match in sum.

[21:16:35] <deniska> vdamewood: steam package in pop!_os repos
[21:17:01] <vdamewood> Okay. So it was Pop! OS's fault, not Valve's.
[21:17:21] <lantech19446> I wouldn't even know if a package was conflicting without the OS telling me and I work in tech
[21:18:10] <deniska> lantech19446: it did tell it was conflicting, but if you never used linux before, you wouldn't really understand what package manager was fussing about

[21:18:41] <pyzozord> it's no longer uncool, it's past the akward phase, it's cool again now
[21:18:42] <lantech19446> O ok I get what you mean now and yes you're right
[21:18:43] <deniska> steam depends on some 32 bit stuff, and the versions present at the moment were in a conflicting state with installed packages, so the best way to install steam as determined by apt was to remove everything else
[21:19:01] <lantech19446> Ouch
[21:19:03] <vdamewood> The moment I saw that it conflicted with "Ppo!_OS-desktop" I knew he was going to nuke his GUI.

[21:19:55] <vdamewood> deniska lantech19446: Well, Synaptic(?) decided it was best to not install Steam, and Linus decided to do it on the command line because the online docs said to.
[21:19:58] <deniska> But if it's first time using apt, you probably wouldn't know any better
[21:20:00] <pyzozord> truth be told python is strictly better in all aspects than php, but php is still ok
[21:20:35] <vdamewood> pyzozord: PHP does have one feature that PHP doesn't that I kind of wish I could use.
[21:20:37] <deniska> pyzozord: php has some warts, but what doesn't
[21:20:44] <vdamewood> that Python doesn't*
[21:20:49] <lantech19446> I'm told that python can interpret tons of other languages can php do that too?
[21:21:13] <vdamewood> The only thing I like about PHP is that it can be embedded into an otherwise normal HTML page.
[21:21:38] <deniska> vdamewood: pop-desktop or whatever it's called is a metapackage and it's safe to delete, it's everything else which was kinda important :)
[21:21:41] <vdamewood> Granted, Django and Jinja templates get pretty close tot that.
[21:21:48] <pyzozord> vdamewood: doesn't python have a feature like this?

[21:25:19] <vdamewood> deniska: That's a templating engine, similar enough to what I mentioned with Django and Jinja, it's not the same as PHP's setup.
[21:25:36] <deniska> vdamewood: yeah, but it literally executed python code, not some special syntax like jinja
[21:25:43] <pyzozord> I'm thinking this should be that hard to add to cpython's parser, no?
[21:26:10] <deniska> pyzozord: this can exist as a 3rd party module, no need for this to be built into the language :)
[21:26:21] <pyzozord> if file extension is .pyml then assume you are printing stuff until you find <?python
[21:26:35] <vdamewood> deniska: You're right, come to think of it.
[21:27:07] <vdamewood> pyzozord: One problem with a Python-based PHP-like effect is significant whitespace.
[21:27:24] <deniska> https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog there's for example this templating engine, agnostic to the language it's embedded into

[23:36:08] <apotheon> nomagno: It could be shallower, but basically everyone who teaches it (classes, books, OJT, whatever) seems inclined to teach it in the wrong order and with emphasis on the wrong elements to get a good, solid understanding.

[23:48:52] <beans> Alright, I am looking for a DS for intervals of numbers (a start and an endpoint, i.e. 1 to 4, 5 to 6 million), that can be efficiently searched with a given number.  The traditional structure is an interval tree, but my structure has simpler characteristics.  None of the ranges in my program will be overlapping, and when an interval is added it will be bigger than any of the intervals 
[23:48:52] <beans> currently in the tree.  The simplest approach would be a binary search tree, but because adding a tree will always be the biggest, I end up with O(n) lookup time as the tree looks like a linked list.  Outside of complex, self-balancing trees, is there a way to get O(log n) lookup time here?

[23:50:53] <Fault> IIRC thatâ€™s exactly when a self-balancing tree structure is needed, when you use a standard binary tree but your use case causes it to degenerate into the worst-case behavior.
