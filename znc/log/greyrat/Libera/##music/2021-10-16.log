[01:11:52] <Awaru> what u think about it?
[01:15:00] *** Joins: snake (~snake@user/snake)
[01:15:10] <circuitbone> trash
[01:16:34] <Awaru> pretty ignorant what you say there
[01:17:11] <circuitbone> You asked for my opinion.
[01:17:35] <Awaru> thats not a constructive critique or anything like that
[01:17:39] <circuitbone> You then proceed to attack it with diatribe.
[01:17:55] <circuitbone> It's full of very common audio and video tropes.
[01:18:03] <louipcD> not my thing
[01:18:18] <louipcD> and the title seems unimaginative to me
[01:19:01] <Awaru> its a guy from the street who tries something meaningful at least
[01:19:15] <circuitbone> Some old guy flexing, intermixed with `male gaze effect` shots. If you are entertaining 14 year olds with a flash of lady meat. It's bang on.
[01:19:15] <louipcD> music sounds like something u get off those free and royalty free jingle sites
[01:19:53] <circuitbone> My conclusion that it's trash, stands.
[01:20:09] <Awaru> well if you would know him you would see it from an other site
[01:20:13] <louipcD> this is like the tommy wiseau of music
[01:20:14] <circuitbone> I doubt it.
[01:20:25] <Awaru> im 100 % sure
[01:20:34] <circuitbone> My perception of you and your music is not intertwined.
[01:20:46] <louipcD> u know tommy wiseau
[01:20:53] <Awaru> this is not me 1.
[01:21:12] <circuitbone> Regardless.
[01:21:18] <Awaru> and 2. it is
[01:21:28] <Awaru> you cant tell anything about that fact as you dont know him
[01:21:32] <sublim20> Awaru, its ok
[01:21:34] <circuitbone> I can hate an artist but like specific tracks.
[01:21:41] <Awaru> if you learn to know him we can talk about it
[01:22:00] <circuitbone> good luck with that.
[01:22:17] <Awaru> with what?
[01:22:30] <circuitbone> Whatever you are trying to shill.
[01:22:37] <sublim20> when the rapper shuts the fuck up, and the trakc just jams, its good
[01:22:58] <sublim20> the rap seems very 'corporate' or ummm, 'by the numbers'
[01:23:11] <Awaru> i try nothing just supporting the artist by sharing his music
[01:23:21] <sublim20> btw, the intro to this video is very jarring
[01:23:22] <Awaru> dont know if you can call that rap though
[01:23:32] <sublim20> yeah, what ever its called
[01:23:40] <louipcD> lol i dont think this guy is on vevo but he put vevo watermark on his vids
[01:23:41] <sublim20> just my opinion
[01:23:55] <Awaru> well try it better.. its just generally that internet jealousy i see everywhere
[01:23:56] <sublim20> id give the artist another spin if he came up
[01:24:23] <sublim20> yeah man, everyone got angry and jealous and shit
[01:24:25] <sublim20> its nice
[01:24:31] <sublim20> oh well, choose to be the light
[01:25:19] <Awaru> cause someone trys things and you not?
[01:25:53] <circuitbone> So your argument that we don't like it is that he has produced a  track and we haven't ?
[01:25:59] <circuitbone> mucking forom
[01:26:54] <Awaru> that you get "angry and jealous and shit" because people trying something
[01:26:58] <sublim20> ahhh, the disassotiation of language
[01:27:04] <louipcD> Awaru: what record label is this guy signed to
[01:27:12] <circuitbone> Emotionally tied to something means you have little scope of seeing it objectively.
[01:27:16] <Awaru> i dont know louipcD 
[01:27:23] <sublim20> sweet
[01:27:28] <sublim20> lets all gang up on the new guy
[01:27:38] <circuitbone> Who said he is new?
[01:27:40] <louipcD> because vevo only works with ppl on labels or with distribution
[01:27:53] <Awaru> i didnt talked with him about that
[01:27:57] <sublim20> YOUR OPINIONS ARE WRONG.  ALL OF THEM.  I KNOW WHATS BEST.  IM RIGHT
[01:28:01] <louipcD> and im kinda suspicious of this vevo stuff on his vids
[01:28:18] * circuitbone walks away from the clown circus car.
[01:28:28] <Awaru> its definately some kind of producers or something working with him
[01:29:00] <sublim20> bye bye circuitbone.  go be tarted elsewhere, mmm kay snookums?  *muah*
[01:29:12] <louipcD> well maybe they got him on vevo 
[01:29:20] <circuitbone> try harder
[01:29:25] * Panther has a cherry tart.
