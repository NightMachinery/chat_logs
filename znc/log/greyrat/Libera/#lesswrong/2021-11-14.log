[01:24:28] <quanticle> They don't want to pay for a datacenter capable of running a properly big language model, so they're buying a bunch of machines, cramming them into their existing data centers, networking them together and saying, "Hey if you add up all these machines it turns out that we have the biggest AI supercomputer!"
[01:24:35] <Gurkenglas> quite right, and yet we should beware ridiculing them for it on twitter
[01:24:59] <Gurkenglas> if we can derail ai races into superyachts humanity lives
[01:25:45] <Gurkenglas> imagine if musk had *stayed* with openai and all the other billionaires started builing their own ais with cowboy hats

[01:28:07] <two2thehead> this is an excellent opportunity to reask gwern, could you answer my tesla dojo is doing vs what google deep mind is doing question?
[01:28:24] <two2thehead> "Tesla's new format is called configurable float 8 or c float 8. An 8-bit floating point format. So it's just a further reduced pressure on memory storage and bandwidth compared to google's machine learning format, by using an even smaller and less precise number. Configurable aspect essentially gives the flexibility to rearrange that 8-bit number according to the specific task it's being used for within the deep learning environment.
[01:28:24] <two2thehead> "The end result being that tesla can train larger ai models with larger amounts of input which is going to work out really well for their specific task of teaching robot cars how to drive on city streets.
[01:28:24] <two2thehead> "So this is a very important point to make. dojo will only ever run at full capacity using these low bit rate formats. that means that it will be the best super computer in the world for ai training and machine learning, but it will never be the best super computer in the world for general purpose applications like forecasting climate change or making vaccines or launching a cyber attack on the us government"
[01:28:29] <two2thehead> Is the speaker correct when he states the following? 'that means that it will be the best super computer in the world for ai training and machine learning'
[01:29:49] <gwern> if you buy all the premises and assume no one else is working on anything impressive, sure
[01:30:27] <two2thehead> ah. exactly what I was hoping for. gwern +1
[01:31:58] <gwern> but I mean, Dojo right now is literally like a single chip sitting on a workbench
[01:32:37] <gwern> and they have no magic solution to a lot of the hard problems that go into making a real supercomputer that can use its nominal peak FLOPS for anything useful

[02:47:47] <quanticle> Also, re: the CIA, it depends on whether you're affiliated with an embassy or not. Most CIA agents are affiliated with an embassy and are thus "employed" by the US State Department.

[02:47:48] <quanticle> what they ought to be earning, going by their official State Department job title).

Photo: Lexus Will a hoverboard that effortlessly floats above the ground ever be reality? Lexus and a team of magnetic-levitation scientists spent 18 months developing a prototype called the Slide. The board contains blocks of a superconductive metal alloy
[06:57:33] <feepbot> cooled to -197 degrees Celsius (-322.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by reservoirs of liquid nitrogen inside the board. The team constructed a hoverpark with a magnetic track beneath the surface. When a superconductor is cooled and placed in a magnetic field, an interaction known as the Meissner effect repels the force of gravity and allows the board to levitate. Placed above the track, the
[06:57:33] <feepbot> Slide hovered about an inch off the ground. When the liquid nitrogen runs out, the superconductors warm and the hoverboard drops to the ground.

[08:39:48] <quanticle> The answer, of course, is yes, as Mark Tarver pointed out so long ago in: http://www.marktarver.com/bipolar.html

[08:41:16] <mst> quanticle: they're both chromium but honestly on windows edge is by far the better browser for everything I care about
[08:42:38] <quanticle> Huh
[08:42:42] <mst> PapuaHardyNet is clearly completely wrong but "just re-skinned chrome" underestimates current edge and I don't believe I'm saying that but it's still true
[08:42:57] <quanticle> I guess it's like VSCode vs. Atom then
[08:43:04] <quanticle> Both built on the same underlying framework (Electron)
[08:43:15] <quanticle> But one is actually usable as a text editor
[08:43:19] <mst> quanticle: lol
[08:43:20] <quanticle> And the other is slow and laggy
[08:43:50] <mst> quanticle: microsoft's stuff is migrating way from electron to an edge based webview system for the same gains ;)
[08:44:25] <quanticle> But yeah, maybe re-skinned Chrome is unfair, but Edge 2 is built on top of the Blink framework, so sites that work in Chrome will work in Edge
[08:44:36] <mst> quanticle: e.g. https://tomtalks.blog/microsoft-teams-2-0-will-use-half-the-memory-dropping-electron-for-edge-webview2/

[08:48:45] <quanticle> I use Firefox for everything and Chrome as my dev browser. I don't really do anything in the browser that requires a lot of performance
[08:49:14] <galambo> I thought firefox had decent dev tools
[08:49:25] <spxtr> I use firefox for everything and I've reshaped my life to never have to do dev in a browser ever again
[08:49:39] <quanticle> galambo: Yes, but I want a browser that doesn't have like eleven layers of adblock
[08:50:04] <quanticle> spxtr: Wow, when you decovert from Google, you *really* deconvert, don't you
[08:50:27] <galambo> firefox is love. firefox is life.
[08:50:35] <rmmh> ...what dev are you doing, spxtr 
[08:50:35] <spxtr> yes! I'm going to be ready to quit google maps soon too, just need to finish psyching myself up for it
[08:50:56] <quanticle> galambo: Like, the last thing I want to find out when I'm trying to debug something is that the thing actually worked but it was uBlock or Ghostery or whatever messing it up
[08:50:58] <galambo> spxtr, what alternative can you realistically use though?
[08:51:05] <spxtr> rmmh: shhhh
[08:51:50] <galambo> quanticle, you should just use a banner that says 'this website works best with ublock origin installed'
[08:51:57] <rmmh> "reshaped my life" aka "quit FAANG to become a physics phd"
[08:51:57] <quanticle> lmao
[08:52:05] <spxtr> rmmh: mostly hobby projects and some simple measurement stuff for my lab, is the actual answer.

[08:52:32] <spxtr> I made a program to help me learn chess openings that I may attempt to release back to the public

[08:53:07] <galambo> spxtr, thats really cool
[08:53:24] <rmmh> spxtr's runway calculation is how many pepperoni pizzas he can afford
[08:53:29] <quanticle> lmao
[08:53:55] <quanticle> Galaxy brain: go vegetarian because cheese pizzas are cheaper than pepperoni
[08:54:02] <rmmh> they aren't, though
[08:54:09] <rmmh> not at stores at least
[08:54:19] <rmmh> restaurants*
[08:54:25] <galambo> quanticle, there is vegan pepperoni
[08:54:32] <spxtr> galambo: the idea is to play your opening all the way through, rather than one move at a time like with chessable
[08:54:44] <galambo> ah
[08:54:47] <rmmh> vegan pepperoni pizza implies vegan cheese, which is an abomination
[08:54:55] <spxtr> you play it against a computer, who can choose moves based on popularity, spaced repitition, etc
[08:55:07] <quanticle> Okay, this is just a rumor, but I hear that there are vegan cheeses which are tolerable.
[08:55:25] <galambo> rmmh, galaxy brain. become vegan, get stuck with bad pizza, dont eat pizza again and become healthy
[08:55:34] <rmmh> worked for those babies!!
[08:55:53] <galambo> vegan pizza is not too bad actually but I had variable experiences
[08:56:03] <rmmh> less sneerily, I prefer vegan food that isn't a substitution, since the sub is generally worse and pointless if you're an omnivore
[08:56:11] <galambo> I think you guys should try them
[08:56:21] <rmmh> so... you know, a nice veggie pasta sauce
[08:56:28] <galambo> rmmh, on the contrary. I think vegan fake meat is a neat idea
[08:56:29] <rmmh> not someone trying to make a vegan bolognese
[08:56:41] <galambo> mushroom bolognese is not bad at all
[08:56:49] <spxtr> crumble up tofu and put it in spaghetti sauce, it works quite well
[08:57:05] <rmmh> as long as you're not in the uncanny valley of fake meat it's fine
[08:57:08] <saturn2> quanticle: no, no one modifies standard CL semantics
[08:57:14] <galambo> if you try the fake alternative and you find it decent, you might decide that becoming vegetarian or vegan is not a bad idea at all
[08:57:26] <galambo> why involve a cow in the food making process?
[08:57:32] <galambo> we are libertarians here
[08:57:37] <galambo> we want efficiency
[08:57:52] <rmmh> because the cow tastes better to me and I don't care about its suffering
[08:58:03] <galambo> cows are just middlemen (middle female animals?)
[08:58:03] <saturn2> they might go wild with their own crazy macros, but that's commonly understood to be a terrible idea
[08:58:34] <galambo> I dont eat cows because I am a feminist
[08:58:37] <quanticle> Huh? What does efficiency have to do with libertarianism? It's the communists who are obsessed with reordering society to make it more efficient, not the libertarians. Lenin and Stalin were avid students of Taylor and Ford.

[09:02:07] <quanticle> rmmh: Evergreen clip
[09:04:06] <quanticle> The really weird thing is that it's actually a true representation, if the surveys that show some significant number of people who identify as vegan have eaten meat recently are anything to go by.
[09:04:18] <galambo> evergrande. ever given. do you guys we will start affixing ever- to disasters like we do -gate to scandals?
[09:05:01] <galambo> quanticle, I dont think I have met a true vegan in real life so far
[09:05:10] <quanticle> Nah, neither the Ever Given nor the Evergrande have captured the public attention in the same way that Watergate did.
[09:05:16] <saturn2> maybe i'll start calling myself vegan
[09:05:31] <quanticle> saturn2: You absolutely can
[09:05:42] <galambo> some people call themselves vegan but  then they say if someone offers me a sandwich with cheese in it they just eat it
[09:05:56] <saturn2> i've now been vegan for the last 12 seconds
[09:05:59] <quanticle> And look, if you *identify* as vegan, then that's what matters, right? 
[09:06:22] <saturn2> YES
[09:06:24] <galambo> quanticle, its like supporting palestine and going to starbucks
[09:06:44] <quanticle> Okay... you'll have to explain that one to me.
[09:06:58] <saturn2> i may not be vegan in my mouth, or my stomach, but i am vegan in my heart, and that's what's really important
[09:07:59] <galambo> saturn2, you may also not be vegan in your butt
[09:08:12] <saturn2> don't be gross
[09:08:51] <galambo> I think one of the motivators for me becoming vegan is I helped in butchering a cow

[09:09:35] <galambo> see how the sausage gets made (literally)
[09:10:25] <galambo> anyways regarding firefox. did you guys find good extensions lately?
[09:11:22] <quanticle> That is in fact how my mom's cousin ended up as a vegetarian. She has a PH.D. in neurology, and as part of her research, she had to spend an entire year beheading chickens, dipping their heads in liquid nitrogen, slicing up the brains and running the slices through an electron microscope
[09:11:35] <quanticle> And after that she was a vegetarian
[09:11:47] <mst> I have a friend who explains himself as a pescatarian to normies
[09:11:59] <quanticle> Is he a pescapescatarian?
[09:12:03] <mst> but whose actual rule is "anything that doesn't have a central nervous system I'll still eat"
[09:12:03] <quanticle> Or just the regular kind?
[09:12:14] <quanticle> So he'll eat bugs?
[09:12:21] <galambo> insectivore?
[09:12:27] <quanticle> Also, don't fish have a central nervous system?
[09:12:43] <galambo> bugs and fish have a nervous system
[09:12:52] <mst> he'll eat some shellfish
[09:12:58] <mst> you know what
[09:13:09] <galambo> I identify as vegan and eat mussels
[09:13:09] <mst> you're all explaining why he doesn't actually explain his principles
[09:13:11] <mst> well done
[09:13:13] <quanticle> Oh, so he'll eat shrimp and such, but not fish
[09:13:28] <quanticle> He can call himself a shrimpaterian
[09:13:56] <quanticle> My mom is basically that
[09:13:56] <galambo> some seafood does not have a nervous system
[09:14:12] <galambo> so vegans can eat it without compromising their principles

[09:15:29] <galambo> I remember reading the best compromise is probably to eat beef and unconscious shellfish and no other animal products
[09:15:31] <galambo> no eggs
[09:15:47] <galambo> maybe milk?
[09:16:10] <galambo> the rationale is that cows have somewhat more decent lives than the average animal and make lots of meat
[09:16:27] <galambo> so you get 90% of the benefits of being vegan without compromising much
[09:16:30] <quanticle> I could go vegetarian pretty easily. There's no real meat that I'm particularly attached to. But vegan? Never. I like cheese. I like cheese *a lot*
[09:16:43] <mst> galambo: What do you call a cow with no legs?
[09:17:09] <galambo> mst, a legless cow?
[09:17:34] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:17:48] <mst> galambo: Ground beef.
[09:17:48] <galambo> I think you guys should consider doing that? just eat beef and milk/cheese. but avoid eggs, chicken, fish and other animal products
[09:18:02] <galambo> mst, lol
[09:18:33] <galambo> the only problem is you cannot call yourselves vegetarian or vegan if you do that
[09:19:04] <mst> I want to avoid battery fram eggs but that's easy enough
[09:19:14] <mst> general animal raising for food is just a thing
[09:19:32] <galambo> but you are reducing most of the animal suffering you would have inflicted otherwise
[09:19:53] <mst> in return for them never existing at all, sure
[09:19:53] <galambo> and still get access to cheese and beef and most of the health benefits of being an omnivore
[09:21:20] <galambo> I think this would be a good first step. if you do that and stick with it, who knows. maybe in the next few years fake meat and cheese become so good you decide to become full fledged vegan

[09:22:41] <quanticle> I see, okay
[09:23:15] <quanticle> But on the other hand, methane emissions from cows represent a significant fraction of global warming.
[09:23:30] <mst> quanticle: shut up and build more nuclear plants
[09:23:31] <galambo> quanticle, actually most people who call themselves vegetarians are probably inflicing more harm than they would have if they stayed omnivores
[09:23:38] <galambo> quanticle, what mst said
[09:24:09] <galambo> quanticle, simply because vegetarians avoid beef
[09:24:29] <rmmh> I refuse to engage with this argument because I refuse to personally alter behavior to reduce environmental impact when there's no global pressure to
[09:24:39] <rmmh> I will not be the first to sacrifice
[09:24:55] <mst> I will spend a bit more to get free range chicken/eggs over battery farmed
[09:24:56] <quanticle> rmmh truly understands the prisoner's dilemma
[09:25:21] <mst> everything else is mostly masturbation compared to 'build more nuclear plants'
[09:25:28] <galambo> mst, yes
[09:25:42] <galambo> mst, people are either stupid or social desirability bias
[09:25:49] <galambo> probably a mix of both

[09:26:39] <quanticle> I don't know if they'll actually go through with the shutdown, now that it's becoming clear exactly how much more natural gas capacity they'll have to build in order to fill the gap.
[09:26:59] <mst> we'll see how it shakes out
[09:27:16] <rmmh> blackouts to own the nukes
[09:27:29] <galambo> I think people will say empty words about climate change and clean energy. but with rampant inflation and soaring energy prices I think people will actually reverse their positions
[09:28:04] <galambo> once they realise these clean policies are actually damaging their livelihood
[09:28:27] <galambo> (I do think climate change is a serious problem)
[09:28:27] <rmmh> china is the only country doing a reasonable nuke strategy, good old dictatorship
[09:28:54] <galambo> (I just think the way people are talking about climate change and the solutions they are proposing are stupid and detrimental)
[09:31:27] <quanticle> rmmh: Yeah, there's a strange alliance of moderate greens, who aren't happy at the thought of more carbon-emitting natural gas plants, and conservatives who are opposed to Germany becoming more reliant on Russian natural gas teaming up to try to save the nuclear power stations.

[10:02:33] <galambo> I should have preordered the 256gb one
[10:03:06] <quanticle> I mean, I got the 256GB one because I was cheapin' out
[10:03:27] <quanticle> Not because I did any kind of rational comparison of the various hardware details
[10:04:08] <galambo> on the other hand do I see myself gaming while outdoors?

[10:05:33] <galambo> I am going to read the book anyways so I might as well do it while outdoors if that makes sense
[10:05:48] <galambo> I dunno
[10:06:14] <quanticle> I mean, honestly, the reason I got it is because I have enough platformers in my Steam Library that I thought, "Yeah, I can see the value of having an ultraportable PC with pre-attached controller that will allow me to play platformers in bed.
[10:06:40] <quanticle> I understand that this is not anywhere close to the typical gaming library.
[10:06:49] <galambo> yes
[10:06:56] <galambo> what platformers do you like?
[10:09:31] <quanticle> Well, just going off memory, because I don't have Steam up at the moment, I have Sonic Mania, Cave Story, Celeste, Ender Lilies, Hollow Knight, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin
[10:11:18] <quanticle> I guess I'll give honorable mention to Bastion, Hades, and Furi because even though they're not really platformers they're also games that can really only be played with a controller.
[10:12:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Abuse is the best platformer
[10:13:35] <quanticle> Yeah, Abuse is a classic

[10:14:28] <spxtr> super mario bros was my first game and I loved it
[10:14:36] <quanticle> Metal Slug, too (though I guess they're still making new Metal Slug games?)
[10:17:09] <quanticle> Honestly, Super Mario Bros is a really fun game to both play and analyze. One thing I find somewhat annoying about modern platformers is that they sort of expect a certain level of video game literacy. You're expected to come into the game knowing things like, "The default direction is right," and knowing how to jump, etc. Whereas Super Mario? That game teaches you all of those concepts, and
[10:17:11] <quanticle> does so without any text or explicit instruction. It's actually a marvel of UI design.
[10:17:53] <quanticle> And it had to be because it was made at a time when you could reasonable assume that the person putting in the cartridge and pressing start was doing so for the very first time in their lives.

[11:19:34] <Gurkenglas> is there an audio driver that dampens sudden increases in volume?
[11:19:59] <galambo_> Gurkenglas, you can try to find a setting called loudness normalization
[11:20:03] <galambo_> or something like that
[11:20:15] <galambo_> but it will objectively make the audio quality worse

[11:24:56] <galambo_> you can lower the volume of the web browser while leaving the other applications with a higher volume
[11:25:26] <spxtr> is it not possible to mute all websites by default and make them request permission to use your speakers?
[11:25:30] <Gurkenglas> surely music does not need to go from too-quiet-to-understand to loud-enough-to-hurt faster than my reaction time?
[11:25:46] <saturn2> spxtr: it used to be, but they took that away
[11:26:00] <galambo_> Gurkenglas, loudness normalization will make all parts of the sound run at the same volume

[11:26:33] <Gurkenglas> ah. i was more thinking "whenever the amplitude would make the speakers output ear-damaging waves, don't."

[11:26:44] <galambo_> Gurkenglas, in your music player there is a feature called track gain
[11:26:53] <saturn2> it's technically possible to make a limiter that only normalizes when the volume is too high
[11:27:07] <galambo_> it runs an algorithm on all the songs and calculates how loud they are
[11:27:12] <galambo_> then adds an offset
[11:27:20] <galambo_> so loud songs run quieter
[11:27:28] <galambo_> and quiet songs run louder
[11:27:30] <Gurkenglas> what music player, you mean chrome? :P

[11:28:00] <PapuaHardyNet> some of the absolute best sleep I've had is after taking naltrexone

[11:28:11] <saturn2> i had that set up in linux back before pulseaudio, but then they changed everything and it doesn't work anymore :(
[11:28:13] <galambo_> in chrome/firefox I just lower the volume of the whole app and accept that it will sound quiet most of the time
[11:28:47] <galambo_> on windows I use wacup fwiw
[11:28:53] <Gurkenglas> ...audacity? that's what I'd use if i wanted to edit music. can I tell audacity to MitM some given operations onto my audio output?
[11:29:16] <quanticle> >i was more thinking "whenever the amplitude would make the speakers output ear-damaging waves, don't."
[11:29:27] <quanticle> well, that'll just clip, won't it?
[11:29:35] <galambo_> Gurkenglas, I think track gain is just an idv3 tag
[11:29:44] <galambo_> the music player reads the value on the idv3 tag
[11:30:00] <galambo_> and changes the volume accordingly
[11:30:09] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, fine how about "do the best-sounding transformation that caps real output volume below x"
[11:30:15] <saturn2> quanticle: clipping is not the only way to do it
[11:30:57] <galambo_> wacup uses a replaygain analyser called EBU R128
[11:31:16] <galambo_> I use a setting called 'apply gain / prevent clipping'
[11:31:17] <quanticle> Yeah, you can probably run some preprocessing to normalize the volume...

[11:31:28] <Robomot> Dynamic range compression - Wikipedia (Dynamic range compression (DRC) or simply compression is an audio signal processing operation that reduces the volume of loud sounds or amplifies quiet sounds, thus reducing or compressing an audio signal's dynamic range. Compression is commonly used in sound recording and reproduction, broadcasting,[1] live sound reinforcement and in some instrument amplifiers.)
[11:31:49] <galambo_> dynamic range compressions makes songs sound congested
[11:32:13] <galambo_> this is the main reason vinyl can sound better than modern recordings
[11:32:16] <spxtr> good audio equipment in a good and quiet environment sounds good on low volume too
[11:32:23] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, all we need to do is take the "turn down the volume when ow" I already do and use the computer's reaction speed instead of mine so it works
[11:32:47] <saturn2> galambo_: you seem to be missing the point of the question
[11:33:01] <galambo_> modern recordings have lots of compression and that ruins the sound quality. of course vinyl is an objectively worse technology
[11:33:57] <galambo_> Gurkenglas, saturn2, the way I handle it is: 1)lower the volume in the browser 2)use replaygain when listening to music
[11:34:06] <spxtr> you can get music in uncompressed form, generally
[11:34:06] <galambo_> works very well for me
[11:34:16] <saturn2> if Gurkenglas sets the compression to kick in only when the sound level would be painful it will not affect normal listening in any way

[11:45:05] <Gurkenglas> is there a gpu in there or what
[11:45:43] <galambo_> Gurkenglas, no the main advantage is that it sounds very 3d. its like a concert around your ears
[11:45:50] <galambo_> also detailed
[11:46:17] <galambo_> but they actually have a bad frequency curve so the tonality sounds off. the instruments sound weird
[11:46:27] <galambo_> so I use an app called sonarworks to fix that
[11:47:32] <galambo_> the hd800s sounds really nice. and I am using it all the time. so its worth it for me. its like having a nice keyboard or display

[11:55:27] <galambo_> Gurkenglas, Obormot\Arcturus, they are $20 headphones.
[11:55:31] <galambo_> I mean come on guys
[11:55:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what could I gain from buying them?
[11:55:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're obviously way less comfortable than the ones I have...
[11:56:09] <cpopell> I think I have $70 headphones mostly so I had something a little tiny bit better for wireless gaming voice
[11:56:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't need wireless if you don't use a headset ;)
[11:56:44] <Gurkenglas> you'd gain information on whether to sell your soul for a pareto improvement on both headphones
[11:57:38] <galambo_> Obormot\Arcturus, they should sound much better than your current headphones. if you notice a difference then you can a)keep them and continue using them b)buy more expensive more comfortable headphones. If you dont notice a difference compared to your current headphones then you can tell yourself that you tried a supposedly good headphone and there was no difference
[11:57:49] <galambo_> so this whole audiophile thing is a waste of money
[11:58:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I already know it's a waste of money though
[11:58:08] <galambo_> so its a cheap $20 experiment
[11:58:48] <galambo_> Obormot\Arcturus, also you can buy a headband for them
[11:59:01] <galambo_> Obormot\Arcturus, https://smile.amazon.com/Parts-Express-Stereo-Lightweight-Headphones/dp/B0002KQZJS/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=ksc75&qid=1636878282&sr=8-7
[11:59:04] <Robomot> Amazon.com: Parts Express Mini Stereo Lightweight Headphones with 4 ft. Cord : Electronics (Buy Parts Express Mini Stereo Lightweight Headphones with 4 ft. Cord: On-Ear Headphones - Amazon.com ‚úì FREE DELIVERY possible on eligible purchases)
[11:59:39] <galambo_> these parts express headphones sound like crap. but their headband fits the ksc75. so this way you have proper headphones
[12:00:06] <galambo_> so if you like the ksc75 but find them uncomfortable you can buy this $6 headband and turn them into proper headphones
[12:00:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're still gonna be uncomfortable
[12:00:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did you look at the link for the ones I have
[12:00:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Look how nice they are. Soft padded headband. Soft padded earpieces
[12:01:52] <saturn2> good advice for people who like bad advice
[12:02:14] <galambo_> Obormot\Arcturus, I dont want to argue with you. I have nothing more to say.
[12:02:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok
[12:05:09] <galambo_> of course anybody reading this can also try the ksc75
[12:13:49] <galambo_> I will add one more thing. there is lots of bullshit in this audiophile scene. but there is also lots of research. so I acknowledge most people are sceptical about audio equipment. but I do notice big differences. and I like to identify as a rationalist and I myself am sceptical about a lot of things myself
[12:14:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Have you done any blind tests
[12:15:00] <galambo_> so maybe I am biased or flat out wrong about audio equipment. but fwiw I am offering you a cheap experiment so you can test it yourself
[12:15:20] <galambo_> Obormot\Arcturus, I cannot do blind tests because I will tell the headphones apart
[12:15:39] <galambo_> simply from their feel
[12:15:58] <galambo_> but there has been lots of research with frequency curves and blind tests
[12:16:08] <galambo_> and there are clear preferences
[12:16:38] <galambo_> so yes there have been double blind placebo controlled experiments in audio
[12:16:44] <galambo_> it is not all bullshit and expensive cables
[12:22:19] <PapuaHardyNet> galambo_: so headphones are the first bottleneck, and track quality is another. what other ones exist that are worth focusing on if you have money to spend on this venture?
[12:23:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo_: This is all a moot point if I listen to songs on youtube and can't tell the difference between minor and major keys or whatever the heck
[12:23:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole "optimize ur sound quality" thing is just unmotivated
[12:28:07] <PapuaHardyNet> "The Harman research shows that the biggest factors in perceived quality are brand (sighted bias), comfort and frequency response."

[19:04:30] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, I don't think that's it - since the number of views is roughly proportional to the number of participants, each upvote should lead to about the same difference in additional views from you promoting it
[19:07:07] <Gurkenglas> or is the depersonalization the issue? shawwwn, if instead of 10k+ upvotes promoting a post further up the frontpage we have 10k people sharing a meme with their friends with no nonlocal effects, is that still disgusting?

[19:13:19] <gwern> Gurkenglas: I think I would argue like this: there are always more views than votes. since views are caused by votes, then a vote must cause >=1 view in expectation. a downvote must decrease views, and an upvote must increase views. so an upvote causes >=1 views. further, it doesn't matter when: votes/views and viral stuff follow scale-free power laws of popularity, so no matter how many...
[19:13:25] <gwern> ...there are already, your upvote is still expected to drive positive views (unless you have very specific knowledge of kinks in the distribution/process, like how an upvote on HN /newest is way more valuable than once it's on the main page)

[19:15:55] <Gurkenglas> reddit can choose to have the 50kth upvote to cause less promotion than would be required for one additional expected view, so the "must" in your reasoning does not follow

[19:16:57] <gwern> but I am aware of no such general caps or thresholds on reddit, although there are probably at least some: getting onto /r/all apparently has some nonlinearities, and there was complaining about the admins penalizing problematic subreddits like The Donald
[19:17:17] <Gurkenglas> proves too much: "there are always more exposures than infections. since exposures are caused by infections, then an infection must cause >=1 exposure in expectation."
[19:17:39] <Gurkenglas> r can in fact be <1
[19:17:58] <gwern> no, that seems fine to me. if an infection caused <1, it would soon cease to exist and you couldn't be looking at any exposures

[22:55:07] <gwern> rsaarelm: if you were /u/maxwellhill, wouldn't you burn down the account and run for the hills when you know an entire world of conspiracy theorists and very online people are coming after you?
[22:55:58] <gwern> even if ghislaine died or was imprisoned or you made comments while she was testifying live on tv, people would still believe you are her on a timer or a hired intern or something

[23:18:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> From the intro to this article about oatmeal cookies: "My theory is, when you find something good, you should hold onto it. That's why I still have a 1970s coffee peculator, I wear comfortable sweatpants until they lose their elastic, it took me a month to get through a box of Pierre Marcolini chocolates, and I'm pretty peeved about the most recent Firefox update. "
[23:18:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> > I'm pretty peeved about the most recent Firefox update
[23:18:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> This was written in 2012 btw
[23:20:02] <two2thehead> TIL the etymology of Ferris wheel, late 19th century: named after George Ferris (1859‚Äì96), the American engineer who invented it. Mildly interesting
[23:20:21] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Did you know? The man that invented the Ferris wheel never met the man that invented the merry-go-round
[23:20:22] <two2thehead> They traveled in different circles.
[23:25:22] <feepbot> <gwern> 'There‚Äôs always, to be clear, something of a scramble for farm equipment, new and used, at the end of the year. The tax code incentivizes farmers who‚Äôve turned an annual profit to use some of that money to upgrade their machinery before the year is out. It‚Äôs just that with prices on many grains surging to multi-year highs and crop sizes robust, farmers have raked in
[23:25:22] <feepbot> the biggest profits in years and yet have limited new supply to invest that cash in.'
[23:25:32] <PapuaHardyNet> good one
[23:27:06] <PapuaHardyNet> 'Affection: I‚Äôll drop and smash a plate, and where previously there might have been some frustration or self-judgement, the mental motion might be ‚ÄúOh, silly Charlie, I still love you‚Äù.'
[23:27:53] <PapuaHardyNet> this feels so... awkward. 
[23:28:16] <PapuaHardyNet> basically the opposite of stoic mentality, or a nietzschean mentality
[23:28:25] *** Quits: galambo (~galambo@user/galambo) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:28:46] <pompolic> "don't reflexively direct anger at yourself" is prrrobably good advice
[23:28:57] <pompolic> on the other hand descriptions like that just feel so alien to my experience
[23:30:01] <PapuaHardyNet> hah! you understand! I don't think of myself as cute or am head-over-heels for myself or would indulge myself
[23:30:47] <PapuaHardyNet> I would say the way I treat myself is more like the way I would treat a close brother who I respect but also am frustrated with endlessly
[23:30:49] <pompolic> i think they also overstate the value of social reinforcement? 
[23:31:07] <pompolic> "value" might not be the right term
[23:31:33] <pompolic> motivating force?
[23:32:06] <PapuaHardyNet> no, I think they actually do have the right idea of social reinforcement, but you require to be a certain kind of person to be this way
[23:32:23] <pompolic> i think that's fair. i was about to type something to that end
[23:32:37] <pompolic> it gives me an idea of the motivation structure of a person on whom it works
[23:32:46] <PapuaHardyNet> honestly, if you want to improve your self esteem, read the book "Self Compassion" by Kristin Neff - don't follow this LW writer's "advice"
[23:32:53] <pompolic> and the idea is that social approval is a big motivator
[23:33:08] <PapuaHardyNet> social approval is a big motivator for all of us!
[23:33:21] <PapuaHardyNet> it is only whose approval we want that defines us
[23:33:32] <pompolic> speak for yourself
[23:34:16] <PapuaHardyNet> what do you mean? you don't want approval from people like your parents, your SO, your best friends?
[23:35:02] <pompolic> i think there are gradations between "i don't want social approval" and "social approval is the top motivation"
[23:35:34] <pompolic> being acknowledged can be pleasant and motivating, but often enough i find that i'd rather not be
[23:36:02] <PapuaHardyNet> that's what I meant, don't worry
[23:36:03] <pompolic> and this brings us back to "you require to be a certain kind of person to be this way"
[23:36:25] <PapuaHardyNet> what kind of person do you have to be, I wonder
[23:36:57] <pompolic> that is to say, i think the person it works for has a motivation structure that assigns high value to social approval
[23:37:22] <pompolic> and it feels alien because for me it's a mixed bag
[23:37:42] <mst> honestly, my reaction to dropping a plate is to go "oh for fuck's sake, Matt you *idiot*" and then immediately forget about it
[23:37:50] <pompolic> :D
[23:37:53] <PapuaHardyNet> they derive their self-worth from a nebulous quality of feeling socially approved, where the approver is their "ingroup"?
[23:38:11] <pompolic> maybe
[23:38:35] <mst> but I mostly get catharsis from cursing my own ineptitude, so it's a reduction in frustration/upset
[23:38:55] <pompolic> mst: yeah, i can call myself an idiot without it triggering a bad mood, but (especially more western) people seem put off by it
[23:38:58] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, that's a polar opposite to a stoic (worth from self-evaluation of acting virtuous) or nietzschean (overcome thy weaknesses and achieve apotheosis)
[23:38:59] <pompolic> yeah exactly
[23:39:32] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: that is actually a coping mechanism - you identify with the judge than the judged
[23:39:37] <pompolic> reminds me of this poast https://wrestlinggnon.com/extropy/2019/06/16/three-are-the-beliefs-by-which-death-will-be-defeated.html
[23:39:37] <Robomot> Three Are The Beliefs By Which Death Will Be Defeated (A few months ago Sarah Constantin posted an interesting thread to twitter about trauma. In it she cites psychology research claiming that deep trauma is link...)
[23:39:55] <pompolic> one of the beliefs being "The self is worthy"
[23:40:06] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: also, acknowledging the mistake helps me
[23:40:15] <PapuaHardyNet> but yeah, I think people whose self-concept is much more resilient (see Kaj Sotala's writings on this) would not need to use this technique
[23:40:36] <pompolic> my take on it is pretty much >implying i need self-worth
[23:40:54] <pompolic> or: if i am worthy i desire to believe i am worthy, if i am not worthy i desire to believe i am not worthy
[23:41:08] <PapuaHardyNet> errr, that's very rationalist of you
[23:41:15] * pompolic signals harder
[23:41:46] <pompolic> i think this is a broad problem i have with what i understand to be self-esteem or self-worth
[23:42:16] <pompolic> it's all useless if it requires you to believe false things
[23:42:47] <Gurkenglas> what about when it only requires you to believe things that are true iff you believe them?
[23:43:24] <pompolic> then those are beliefs about your map?
[23:43:38] <pompolic> do they pay rent in anticipated experiences?
[23:43:59] <mst> I think that sometimes it's fine to e.g. think better of yourself than necessary, if it gives you more room to focus on reality in the cases that are important to you
[23:44:13] <mst> another case of purchasing fuzzies and utilons separately
[23:44:21] <PapuaHardyNet> the only thing that goes through my head when reading that article is "this is so gay"
[23:45:48] <Gurkenglas> Suppose your brain was so silly as to extract effects from your map through more than your actions, and you wished to shape those effects. You'd feel dirty making the map not correspond to the territory, but you might believe one of multiple things about what effects your brain is going to extract from your map, and each of these would turn out correct. Do you know pick whichever belief is most useful?
[23:46:08] <Gurkenglas> -know+now
[23:46:11] <mst> pompolic: also it occurs to me that with somebody who tends to judge themselves overly harshly in counterproductive ways, this sort of thing - even if some false beliefs are involved - may make them better calibrated on net
[23:46:22] <mst> pompolic: you could even say ... *sunglasses* ... less wrong
[23:46:44] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: there are two ways you can deal with this problem you stated
[23:47:12] <pompolic> mst: i can only speak for myself, but when i do that i find myself to be biased in the other direction
[23:47:42] <PapuaHardyNet> 1) minimize the qualities you evaluate yourself by so it is always in your power to be evaluated as good given you put in the effort (the stoic method)
[23:48:12] <mst> pompolic: yeah, my ego is quite healthy enough on its own, but this is not universal
[23:48:53] <PapuaHardyNet> 2) do a lot of mental manipulation (not outright lies), and qualify your expectations of yourself, such that you pass your evaluations (the Kaj sotala method)
[23:50:23] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: do you think it is easy to lie to yourself, to believe in belief? I have tried, it doesn't work all that well
[23:50:50] <PapuaHardyNet> it isn't sustainable. not after you make a mental habit to not lie to yourself as a teenager and follow it for years
[23:51:22] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: i think to compute the downstream effects of the beliefs, you also need to know the actual state-of-matters, which means you cannot even do it anymore
[23:52:18] <pompolic> if there is no state-of-matters, and you have a large freedom, then it... doesn't correspond to anything real?
[23:52:25] <pompolic> I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it
[23:52:58] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: what problem?
[23:53:20] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: oh I can't lie to myself, that's literally it
[23:54:04] <PapuaHardyNet> The crucial skill of rationalization isn't something I seem to know how to consciously do
[23:54:04] <mst> I don't think people generally perceive successful cases of doing so -as- lying to themselves
[23:54:10] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, here's an example. Alice could in a year take strategies A or B, which by default aren't better than one another. Alice believes she will take A. She therefore takes actions that improve her position in the worlds where she takes A. A year hence it is time to decide which strategy to take. Alice perceives that A is now better and takes it. Her belief turned out correct, and so would have the 
[23:54:10] <Gurkenglas> opposite belief.
[23:54:25] <mst> that seems pretty much baked in to what 'successful' would be
[23:55:37] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: right, I agree with you. perhaps it really is a skill I just haven't learned. I recall Nate Soares writing about it but he never gave tactical advice
[23:56:13] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: all right! I now get what you mean and its practical implications
[23:56:31] <pompolic> it clarified things for me too
[23:56:36] <PapuaHardyNet> it is basically the self-fulfilling prophecy applied to oneself
[23:57:21] <Gurkenglas> The one time I was mad at EY was upon first reading the double-think post, when he *tried* to shape the reader against their will, in much the same manner that he had Harry shape Draco and later feel sinful about it.
[23:57:52] <pompolic> interesting, how exactly?
[23:58:17] <pompolic> it's been a while since i read it
[23:59:05] <Gurkenglas> "Was Harry going to Science Hell for what he'd done? Harry wasn't sure. (...) And then there was the part after that... But he hadn't actually lied to Draco. Draco had believed it, and that would make it true."
[23:59:11] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: given your beliefs about yourself if you -had- learned it you would also have had to convince yourself that you hadn't though - so I'm not sure how one would tell the difference after the fact
