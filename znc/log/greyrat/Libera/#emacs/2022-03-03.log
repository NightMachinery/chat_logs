[00:51:35] <Diablo-D3> I think they're calling that the Silicon Hills officially, since its hilly af in that part of Austin
[00:51:58] <e1f> twenty years ago, toronto was silicon valley north; amazon just opened a dev office last year

[00:53:37] <bpalmer> I just look askance at "the real silicon valley" being in not a valley. The silicon valley of X draws less attention to the topographical inclinations.
[00:54:04] <grym> i'm mostly joking, though; we have one or two big boys left but not really
[00:54:10] <Diablo-D3> the silicon valley being a valley is a weird statement
[00:54:18] <bpalmer> Austin has far fewer superfund sites, so I don't know how much silicon it could have been putting down.

[00:55:28] <e1f> shrysr: yes that came up in season 1 of "reacher" as a joke
[00:55:35] <bpalmer> e1f: think about how much water a fab needs, then think about where the single worst location to put one would be.
[00:55:43] <Diablo-D3> intel put their az fab there basically on orders by the US
[00:55:54] <leah2> would be useful if the old NEWS. files contained the release dates...
[00:55:54] <Diablo-D3> the entire infra there was built out to host domestic fabs
[00:56:10] <e1f> i thought arizona was a desert too
[00:56:11] <Diablo-D3> so everyone else going there is going there due to significant US gov investment
[00:56:26] <grym> e1f: it very much is
[00:56:40] <Diablo-D3> which is fine, it also congregates our fab smartasses, so they stay in the area when they switch companies
[00:56:58] <Diablo-D3> makes it a lot easier to promote a healthy job competition to drive wages up, and then attract more talent
[00:57:00] <bpalmer> yes, arizona is a desert, currently in a drought (I'm not sure how much of Texas is drought-ridden at the moment), *and* arizona's human population is growing at an insane rate.
[00:57:03] <e1f> texas has the rio grande, which, at one time was grande, i suppose

[01:14:53] <bpalmer> lemacs: although I don't necessarily recommend it, use-package is one common way to make it easier to defer your configuration until it's demanded.

[01:15:58] <lemacs> got it bpalmer, what would be the alternative without using `use-package`? what function should I look for?
[01:16:24] <bpalmer> lemacs: with-eval-after-load
[01:16:33] <lemacs> I saw that I have 3 requires, besides (require 'package), they are company, lsp-mode and org
[01:16:34] <technomancy> lemacs: using autoloads instead of require is another thing that can help
[01:16:45] <technomancy> yeah that would do it, haha
[01:16:52] <bpalmer> e.g., suppose you want to configure the foo package.  (with-eval-after-load "foo" (define-key foo-mode-map (kbd "C-c a") 'my-thing))

[01:17:15] <bpalmer> the define-key bit won't be run until after "foo" is loaded, and it will be run just once.

[01:19:44] <lemacs> nice technomancy, I'll look into that too
[01:20:10] <lemacs> got it bpalmer, I'll try
[01:20:13] <lemacs> thanks :D
[01:20:26] <technomancy> lemacs: actually if you installed using package.el you should have the autoloads set up for you automatically
[01:20:34] *** Joins: sioh (~Gz@user/sioh)
[01:20:43] <technomancy> so the only reason you have require is probably because you're not using with-eval-after-load as bpalmer suggests
[01:20:45] <technomancy> probably
[01:21:51] <lemacs> where can I see which packages are using the autoloads?
[01:22:25] <lemacs> I installed everything with packages.el, so the requires I added to the config are meaningless?
[01:22:33] <technomancy> easiest way is to launch without the require and see if C-h f org-mode shows up
[01:22:50] <technomancy> lemacs: they're not meaningless; they force things to be loaded early so your other config can run immediately
[01:22:59] <technomancy> but it's better to just defer your other config until after the package loads

[02:01:52] <spikemaster> It's all about avoiding (require 'foo). Also I remember (package-initialize) itself takes some time, like a quarter second.  So you can get even more speed by not using the package manager at all.
[02:03:07] <spikemaster> but you can easily get under ~1 sec while using the package manager, so i wouldn't start there.  Abandoning the package manager would be your final step, after you did the standard things like defer loading, etc.

[05:14:50] <Common-Lisp> I also don't understand the question
[05:15:06] <technomancy> vterm has the entire state of the terminal represented internally; it displays in the buffer a copy of that data, but it's not the real thing. your elisp repl is going to want to manipulate the buffer, thinking that the buffer is the real thing, but then the next time vterm redraws, it blows away the repl's changes.
[05:15:50] <technomancy> the changes the repl wants to make cannot be represented in a way that vterm can accommodate them, unless you rewrite vterm or whatever.
[05:16:36] <technomancy> but then there's the question of why you'd even want this? you don't need a terminal to run a repl; it's just getting in the way.

[05:32:37] <hyiltiz> if i run R from within a shell/term/vterm, it doesn't
[05:33:07] <hyiltiz> so I figured, why not "solve" it once and for all by automatically embed all such processes and REPLs inside vterm

[05:36:43] <spudpnds> I've wanted to do this too, because IPython works a lot better in vterm than it does in an inferior python buffer.

[15:56:48] <sathiana> bremner, I used SPC back when using vim for toggling folds and wanted the same, I tried unbinding SPC first and all that but still no luck, I will try doing the minimal break down and see
[15:57:04] <madnificent> I like thu current Emacs keybindings for common operations, but I think the default should change to something people understand.  Lower the barrier for new users.
[15:57:22] <artefact> but that's changing the barrier, not lowering it
[15:57:41] <bremner> sathiana: I'm not an evil-mode user, but I suggest assume nothing and check the documentation for whether specific features are present in evil-mode
[15:58:30] <sathiana> madnificent, I like many of emacs keybinding but except for the text manipulation ones
[15:58:44] <madnificent> For users coming from anything else than Vim or Emacs itself, I think C-c, C-v, C-x will really lower the barrier.  Other commands (like moving the cursor etc) are extra, so you put users in the context of learning extra things rather than relearning things.
[15:58:59] <madnificent> Ideally, someone with a research budget researches it and provides us with actual insights ^_^

[16:00:30] <bremner> madnificent: it would be pretty irritating for people that actually know how to use emacs, but *shrug*, I don't think there's anything new to say here
[16:00:42] <bodiccea> I am using gitea, which uses go-org/chroma as rendering engine for org files. However, there is no strict correspondance between org src blocks and chroma engines (example: org "conf" block can be used for totally different files, such as conf[Unix], conf[space], etc... What would be the best approach to add some metadata to a src block, that could be used by go-org/chroma only ? For example, "+BEGIN_SRC conf :chroma docker", or something like
[16:00:42] <bodiccea> "#+ATTR_CHROMA: :lang docker" ?
[16:01:11] <madnificent> bremner: I agree, but we know how to turn it back to our normal, right?  They don't know how to turn it into their normal.

[16:17:07] <madnificent> artefact: You'd learn the other movement commands which seems far more important than this tiny hill we're standing on.  Except for muscle memory, I don't know why I'd prefer our current shortcuts very much (the combination of C-w and M-w does indeed teach something but I think you can learn that in other ways).
[16:17:37] <madnificent> Anyhow, perhaps this is all bikeshedding.  I'm glad Vim users are finding their way to Emacs and that they can take a bunch of their keybindings with them.

[22:17:36] <Catie> It's a nice way of centralizing services into a single configuration file. FreeBSD _almost_ does that sometimes with rc.d, but I kind of like this one
[22:17:38] <bpalmer> Also, the daytime protocol *should* be safe to be handled by anybody, since it doesn't do anything with any user input

[23:24:51] <acdw> C ?
[23:24:52] <fsbot> c is the language in which the emacsen core such as the redisplay is written. Most of the user functionality is written in Lisp, however.
[23:24:58] <acdw> Lisp?
[23:24:59] <fsbot> Lisp is [0/5] one of the oldest programming languages, originating in the late 1950s. It's constantly evolving, with the current dialects being Common Lisp and Scheme. Though Emacs Lisp is younger than both Scheme and Common lisp, it is based on an older Lisp. Emacs brings with it a great library for text manipulation and inter-process communication, which provides a great programming environment. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
