[00:31:32] <corn266> anyone know if the Dell PERC H730p can handle drives of different sizes in a RAID configuration?
[00:31:37] <vinrock> takehashi 54
[00:31:47] <vinrock> ofc it can
[00:31:56] <Guest49> I think so corn but it is limited to the smallest drive
[00:32:03] <CptLuxx> how should that work
[00:32:11] <CptLuxx> what Guest49 said
[00:32:19] <corn266> yea, i meant can it utilize all of the drives without bottlenecking on the smallest
[00:32:33] <corn266> erm
[00:32:47] <corn266> gimping the storage space of the largest drive
[00:32:55] <vinrock> wekaest link in the chain always gona be the weakest link
[00:33:02] <vinrock> yes it will gimp everything
[00:33:17] <corn266> okay i'll pass that along to bossman, i wasn't able to find anything concrete on google
[00:41:15] <Guest49> I am trying to make our computers be able to go to a 10.24 network through a 192.168.0.67 address.  If I do route add 10.24.0.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.67 it works on my computer.  They added a new route to our gateway and it does not seem to work for everyone else.  Any suggestions on what to do?
[00:42:01] *** Quits: bn_work (uid268505@id-268505.highgate.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[00:43:03] <vinrock> is the gateway a linux box that you added a static route to as per your own machine
[00:43:08] <vinrock> or some wacky shit
[00:43:51] <Guest49> the gateway (192.168.0.1) is a sonicwall.  the 67 is a pfsense.  our computers are windows
[00:44:22] <corn266> y'all think java is close enough to C# that i could apply to a job with a 5yrs min C# requirement?
[00:44:56] <corn266> wait wtf
[00:44:57] <vinrock> if i was a c# dev with 5 years under the belt id feel confident enough to submit an app
[00:45:25] <corn266> why does this job requiring C# experience also have a requirement to also lift up to 20 pounds
[00:45:48] *** Joins: PrincessZoey (uid477743@user/princesszoey)
[00:46:27] <corn266> well i have around 5-7 years of java experience
[00:46:33] <corn266> but no real C# experience
[00:46:38] <vinrock> probably dealt with a buncha bitchmade dudes and had enough of it
[00:47:10] <vinrock> guest49 so you have a sonicall vpn'd to a pfsense over wan?
[00:47:17] <vinrock> whats the setup here
[00:47:36] <Jaelae> anyone familiar with greek gyros - do they normally put lamb and beef together in the same meat?
[00:47:43] <vinrock> yeah
[00:47:46] <vinrock> lamb is OG gyro
[00:47:50] <vinrock> thats what you want
[00:47:59] <Jaelae> but its a mix right
[00:48:01] <Jaelae> lamb and beef
[00:48:06] <vinrock> i think so but im not 10%
[00:48:10] <vinrock> its common to see it sold as mix tho
[00:48:15] <Jaelae> i ordered it in the cafeteria at work
[00:48:17] <vinrock> lamb/beef
[00:48:17] <Jaelae> it was pretty horrible
[00:48:21] <Jaelae> but i might blame the cafeteria
[00:48:26] <vinrock> yeah id say cafeteria
[00:48:31] <vinrock> because i absolutely love a lamb gyro
[00:49:12] <Jaelae> i knew reddit-sysadmin would get me the answer
[00:49:13] <Jaelae> ty
[00:49:22] <vinrock> np
[00:49:37] <boi> if your users are like
[00:49:41] <boi> my monitor is kinda old and blurry
[00:49:44] <boi> do u just get em new ones
[00:49:50] <vinrock> nah
[00:49:53] <vinrock> well
[00:49:54] <vinrock> depends
[00:50:03] <vinrock> if they complain and im like yeah that shits janky ill hook em up
[00:50:14] <vinrock> if theyre being whiny it depends how much i like them
[00:50:19] <boi> lolol
[00:50:31] <boi> at my place it requires 2 approvals, 1 from the the users supervisor and then the IT supervisor
[00:50:47] <boi> and somehow 1 of the supervisors approved a ultrawide and hell no we arent buying one
[00:51:06] <vinrock> i have a warehouse manager that approved ultrawides for the warehouse clerks
[00:51:14] <vinrock> i dont mind shadow it when its just displays
[00:51:15] <boi> i think users are just greedy cause we kinda let them expensve whatever they wanted
[00:51:16] <oxipital> vinrock: this is the way
[00:51:16] <boi> for WFH
[00:51:18] <vinrock> and it came from their cards so w/e
[00:51:30] <boi> so they now realized how much more sucky the office setup is
[00:51:34] <vinrock> yup
[00:51:39] <oxipital> treat them according to how well you like them
[00:51:45] <vinrock> ^
[00:51:59] <boi> guess ill just buy it for them 
[00:52:05] <oxipital> users have an inflated idea of how important they are
[00:52:10] <vinrock> keep in mind
[00:52:10] <corn266> man i really wanna work with JFDkthx but i do not wanna get sued by my current boss
[00:52:15] <vinrock> anyone sees that ultrawide they're al gonan want one
[00:52:22] <vinrock> thats how this one whole warehouse office ended up with everone having one
[00:52:23] <oxipital> and the inflation is inversely related to how fucking capable they are
[00:52:23] <boi> yeah i aint buying the ultrawide
[00:52:28] <vinrock> cuz he approved the one dude and it caused a buncha shit
[00:52:29] <boi> new monitors that are standard is fine tho
[00:52:37] <boi> the only time i bought someone "big" monitors as a exception
[00:52:42] <boi> was that they were really old and needed it
[00:52:51] <vinrock> yeah the first warehouse guy that asked has a vision problem
[00:52:56] <vinrock> but the other guys got jelly
[00:53:06] <boi> if u have vision problems u dont need a ultrawide tho you need a big monitor lmao
[00:53:18] <vinrock> well he basically got a gigantic ultrawide that he shoves his face into lol
[00:53:19] <corn266> shoulda said that unless they have a medical issue then they can fuck off
[00:53:27] <boi> speaking of monitors
[00:53:30] <asdf123663> Anyone searching for job recently?
[00:53:34] <boi> im seriously considering of maybe getting
[00:53:36] <vinrock> eh they asked the warehouse manager who is president's son so that one is on him

[00:56:56] <oxipital> and i just got told theres not enough justification for a junior
[00:57:02] <asdf123663> I turn on TV in the reception hall
[00:57:05] <boi> i want a dedicated helpdesk person
[00:57:07] <oxipital> when i was told thered be one in the interview
[00:57:09] <boi> so i dont have to do tickets
[00:57:22] <oxipital> i want a ticketing system
[00:57:31] <boi> we use servicenow and it sucks ass
[00:57:33] <oxipital> i told my boss no more stopping me in the hall
[00:57:35] <asdf123663> Let me know if any jr sysadmin position is hiring in TX
[00:57:37] <oxipital> email it or i wont do it
[00:57:38] <boi>  cant believe we pay like
[00:57:43] <boi> few hundred thousand doollars for servicenow
[00:58:05] <boi> but we dont want to pay a consultant properly to configure it so it sucks ass
[00:58:05] <Guest49> vinrock we have a sonic wall as our main gateway
[00:58:34] <oxipital> im trying to set up spiceworks
[00:58:40] <Guest49> the pfsense is local on the network so we can have a dev network without paying for vlans
[00:58:41] <oxipital> they  make it a pita
[00:58:43] <oxipital> on purpose
[00:58:59] <Guest49> spiceworks sucks. Use something better
[00:59:22] <oxipital> i can
[00:59:25] <oxipital> +t
[00:59:34] <oxipital> i cant purchase software
[00:59:55] <boi> i wanna 
[00:59:57] <boi> buy intune
[01:00:05] <boi> rejected tho
[01:00:10] <oxipital> i cant set up a server
[01:00:14] <boi> why not
[01:00:18] <oxipital> i cant set a static ip address
[01:00:21] <oxipital> no hardware
[01:00:26] <boi> wat
[01:00:40] <oxipital> all our it is in a main dc in texas
[01:02:29] <vinrock> guest49 i dont use sonicwall but it looks like you just have to create a rule from the one lan to the other from what im seein, no need to create static routes
[01:03:04] <corn266> fortinet is a bit different, you have to create the rule on both ends and also set up static routes
[01:03:18] <corn266> also black holes
[01:03:34] <vinrock> yeah you would have to do it on both ends
[01:03:39] <Guest49> If I use the route add command I can get to the network fine
[01:03:45] <vinrock> so im not sure what the pfsense box would need
[01:03:55] <Guest49> I wish I had access to the sonicwall
[01:04:13] <vinrock> oh so you're saying route add on the other machines doesnt work like yours does
[01:04:26] <vinrock> i thought you meant you configured the sonicwall and no bueno
[01:05:15] <Guest49> We did add a route on the sonic wall and no one can access the 10.24 network unless they do the route add command
[01:05:41] <corn266> have you restarted a test machine?
[01:05:46] <Guest49> yeah
[01:05:54] <Guest49> restarted our db server
[01:05:56] <corn266> like, it should have no bearing because default should send it to the gateway
[01:07:00] <Guest49> right
[01:07:28] <Guest49> I wish I could see what the Source and destination is in the rule the company sent me
[01:08:57] <corn266> does traceroute provide any useful information?
[01:09:08] <Guest49> The other issue that I am having is that the pfsense box itself will not resolve dns at all
[01:09:13] <oxipital> is the local routing table maybe messed up with a prmanent route?
[01:09:32] <oxipital> and all of thise sounds like a job for wireshark
[01:09:41] <fritzwastaken> s/wireshark/my butt
[01:09:42] <layer8> oxipital meant: "and all of thise sounds like a job for my butt"
[01:09:53] <fritzwastaken> heh
[01:09:59] <corn266> also, the forwarding rules are sequential, so make sure the rule for the VPN internal->VPN is above internal->WAN
[01:11:27] <oxipital> the answer is to throw away your network
[01:11:30] <oxipital> go back to paper
[01:11:34] <Guest49> tracert 10.24.0.69 goes to our public IP then times out for the rest of them
[01:11:34] <corn266> the whole thing
[01:11:41] <corn266> just toss it into the trash
[01:11:45] <Guest49> 1 hop
[01:11:52] <corn266> 1 hop this time
[01:11:55] <oxipital> thats expected right?
[01:12:04] <fritzwastaken> CRISS CROSS
[01:12:25] <oxipital> and the other ones like times out?
[01:12:27] <corn266> shouldn't it go something like: 1. gateway; 2. timeout ?
[01:12:38] <oxipital> that just means the next hops dont send back icmp
[01:12:45] <Guest49> should go to our sonicwall (which I think is our public IP) then go to the 192.168.0.67 address right?
[01:12:59] <fritzwastaken> this conversation looks fun
[01:13:07] <oxipital> ext connection->internal
[01:13:12] <corn266> yea we're not even talking about penises
[01:13:21] <fritzwastaken> Are we walking an accountant through fixing their network?
[01:13:33] <Guest49> a developer
[01:13:33] <oxipital> if youre using vpn then its vpn->vpn server->internal
[01:13:39] <fritzwastaken> even worse
[01:13:40] <corn266> it's a vpn issue fritzwastaken
[01:13:43] <Guest49> No VPN for this
[01:13:45] <corn266> fuck you fritzwastaken
[01:13:48] <Guest49> all local network
[01:13:49] <corn266> oh, wait what?
[01:13:51] <fritzwastaken> an accountant knows they dont know anything, a dev thinks they know everything
[01:13:54] <oxipital> uh
[01:14:03] <oxipital> so it should be 1 hop to destination
[01:14:13] <Guest49> (I used to be a sys admin)
[01:14:15] <corn266> i thought you had a sonicwall to pfsense vpn?
[01:14:29] <oxipital> if its local network, no subnet boundaries
[01:14:37] <Guest49> No. Let me paste a drawing real quick
[01:14:38] <oxipital> blah->your local ip
[01:14:42] <oxipital> oh jesus
[01:14:45] <corn266> ayyyy ms paint time
[01:14:53] <oxipital> lord, lets talk about penises
[01:15:04] <corn266> so mine is bigger than all  of yours
[01:15:21] <oxipital> first i get to do sys adminz in the hood
[01:15:24] <oxipital> and now this
[01:15:41] <corn266> using guns to fire packets at their destination
[01:15:52] <corn266> PAH syn PAH ack
[01:16:19] <vinrock> where the fuck did you grow up that the soud for a gun is PAH??
[01:16:26] <oxipital> "yo i never knew networking was this hard. now i know. wish i knew earlier"
[01:16:29] <oxipital> india
[01:16:35] <corn266> tf? what kind of guns are you firing?
[01:16:43] <vinrock> the kind that go BANG?
[01:17:02] <oxipital> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C--iuM8NcQc
[01:17:04] <corn266> eh, it's kinda either or

[01:17:15] <Guest49> That is a picture of my network rn
[01:17:24] <vinrock> thats beautiful im gona hang it on my fridge
[01:17:36] <oxipital> why are you connhecting directly to the sonicwall
[01:17:55] <Guest49> we added the pfsense to create a new network for the devs since people keep stomping on our IP address
[01:17:59] <vinrock> i guess sonicwall needs licenses for a vlan and he cant pay for it
[01:18:01] <fritzwastaken> Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
[01:18:07] <fritzwastaken> Wait, 2022 is already in their documentation?
[01:18:11] <vinrock> yeah
[01:18:18] <vinrock> 2022 has been included in everthing for a few months now
[01:18:24] <vinrock> i think it releases in december
[01:18:28] <fritzwastaken> prolly since marchn when they announced it
[01:18:35] <fritzwastaken> noice, and here I am with 200 2012r2 servers
[01:18:38] <Guest49> No, sonicwall is controlled by an outside company that wont do vlans here

[01:20:05] <Guest49> Currently one server and the pfsense gateway

[01:41:44] <lantech19446> I don't know if anyone who was helping me the other day thinking about the modem issues is here but it turns out it was the modem, the brand new modem they put in wasn't maintaining sufficient signal so tomorrow we get yet another modem. But now I have a new problem, I'm troubleshooting a bottleneck I've removed everything between this office and the switch with the exception of the cable in the wall I've even 
[01:41:45] <lantech19446> changed out the computer and where everyone else is getting 350Mbps she's getting less than 100
[01:42:15] <mistiry> Told you it was the modem :)
[01:42:20] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Hahaha
[01:42:46] <corn266> probably her NIC
[01:42:50] <mistiry> So you have one single drop that is slow?
[01:42:53] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Bloody modems
[01:42:57] <CableNinja> dev coworker: 'sudo fixes everything'
[01:43:02] <lantech19446> corn266: brand new gigabit nic
[01:43:27] <lantech19446> mistiry: yep i managed to fix all the others all of them were really simple fixes but not this one
[01:43:58] <mistiry> tested both ends for continuity? re-terminated the ends?
[01:44:12] <mistiry> Easy to test her PC - plug it into a known-working port and see.
[01:44:20] <corn266> >reterminated
[01:44:27] <corn266> that's called buying a new cable son
[01:44:49] *** Quits: rpifan (~rpifan@user/rpifan) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:44:54] <mistiry> Taking 5 mins to repunch a connector is much easier than running a new cable drop thru a ceiling
[01:45:04] <lantech19446> both ends are good i used my cable tester on them, haven't reterminated them I can't access the ends well enough to do it on my own computer was plugged in at my desk earlier and got full speed
[01:45:04] <corn266> oh repunch
[01:45:16] <corn266> yea i was thinking a direct connect
[01:45:51] <lantech19446> there should be a comma between own and computer
[01:46:13] * oxipital talks with hp support
[01:46:20] <mistiry> So the last thing to elimiate is cable vs switch. On the switch, move the connection to a new (known good) port and test.
[01:46:30] <lantech19446> did that already too
[01:46:31] * oxipital wants to die 
[01:46:32] <mistiry> If still slow, its the cable drop. If it's fast now, the port.
[01:46:33] <lantech19446> no change
[01:46:39] <mistiry> So its the cable drop.
[01:46:40] <corn266> could be the connector itself, if it's not rated for gigabit then you won't get gigabit speeds
[01:46:50] <mistiry> Start with reterminating.
[01:46:56] <mistiry> If that doesnt work, run a new line.
[01:47:00] <lantech19446> i'm only expecting 350Mbit we don't pay for gigabit
[01:48:00] <corn266> i mean, if you're going internal and all your switches and drop points are gigabit then you should get gigabit speeds
[01:48:22] <mistiry> Can you get more than 100Mbit internally, and its only slow external?
[01:48:29] <lantech19446> i'm testing it on google speedtest so i'm only expecting external speeds I don't think what's in the wall is rated to gigabit either
[01:48:52] <corn266> if it's not gigabit then it's megabit
[01:49:02] <lantech19446> mistiry: my backup was running consistently around 100Meg too
[01:49:05] <lantech19446> and that's internal
[01:49:28] <mistiry> 100mbit NIC?
[01:49:32] <mistiry> Cat3 cable? 
[01:49:32] <corn266> i assume you don't have any traffic shaping rules?
[01:49:53] <lantech19446> mistiry: gigabit nic i'm assuming cat5 in the walls
[01:49:58] <lantech19446> corn266: nope
[01:49:58] <mistiry> Only have 2 pairs of wires connected in the connector?
[01:50:07] <lantech19446> no they're 8 pin
[01:50:21] <corn266> eh, ethernet only uses like 2 pairs
[01:50:25] <corn266> even if they're 8-pin
[01:50:26] <mistiry> not gigabit
[01:50:33] <mistiry> gigabit uses all 4 pairs
[01:50:43] <lantech19446> i think you guys are right though it's gotta be the cable I've eliminated everything else
[01:50:52] <corn266> ...i'm pretty sure not
[01:51:08] <corn266> otherwise PoE wouldn't really work
[01:51:19] <lantech19446> it definitely uses at least 4 i think 2 are for power i'm not sure what the other two do
[01:51:26] <mistiry> https://www.flukenetworks.com/knowledge-base/application-or-standards-articles-copper/1000base-t-over-category-5#:~:text=1000BASE%2DT%20is%20designed%20to,The%20term..

[01:52:06] <lantech19446> ya know what I see a cable long enough to test this, I'll be back in a bit
[01:52:09] <corn266> oh weird. wonder where i got that idea in my head from
[01:52:58] <mistiry> couldnt tell you lol
[01:57:00] <oxipital> is this a cable modem?
[01:57:28] <corn266> most likely, but the modem shouldn't  be the issue since it's a single machine
[01:57:35] <corn266> erm
[01:57:40] <corn266> it's affecting a single machine
[01:59:07] * oxipital hasnt been paying attention
[01:59:43] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> Gigabit uses all 4 innit
[01:59:43] <mistiry> corn266: to address the PoE part, it has to do with frequency of the signal. power is 60hz signal, whereas data is a much higher frequency. Phantom power, if you wanted to read more about it.
[01:59:58] <mistiry> yes that was already established
[02:00:09] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> You were already established!
[02:00:13] <mistiry> GOTEM
[02:00:35] <corn266> i just kinda figured they elevated the power across the wires being used and the NIC accounted for it when processing data over those wires
[02:00:55] <mistiry> nope
[02:01:40] <corn266> yea i used to work a sound booth so i know what phantom power is
[02:01:41] <oxipital> i just saw that they isolated it to a single machine to modem
[02:01:55] <corn266> kinda
[02:02:02] <oxipital> so i wondered if its a power insertion issue at the cable modem sid
[02:02:10] <mistiry> right so its the same idea
[02:03:08] <lantech19446> yep it's the cable

[08:25:29] <MikeSpears> 8:11 PM PDT We continue to make progress in addressing the increased error rates for DynamoDB in the US-EAST-1 Region. The root cause of the issue is a problem with the metadata subsystem used by DynamoDB, where several nodes are in an unhealthy state. We continue to work towards restoring the health of these nodes. The issue affected a subset of
[08:25:29] <MikeSpears> DynamoDB tables that are associated with the unhealthy nodes in the metadata subsystem. For these tables, customers will experience increased error rates until we have resolved the issue. DynamoDB tables that are not associated with the affected metadata nodes, are not affected by this issue. We continue to work towards full resolution.
