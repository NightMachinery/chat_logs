[02:05:25] <gilberth> Knuth' preprocessor TANGLE which turns the TeX sources into Pascal is curious. Given a macro like say "@d foo(#) == mem[p+#]", you'd expect at first that "foo(-1)" would turn into "mem[p+-1]" which would be a syntax error. But you get "mem[p-1]".
[02:06:53] <gilberth> This somehow is handled as a stage just prior to output. "100+-1" => "99", or "100--1" => "101". Moreso "x:=4 0 0" => "x:=400".
[02:10:32] <gilberth> As I want my own preprocessor, I am not so sure how to handle that. I want to preserve comments, yet "10 {blah} -1" => "9" with TANGLE.
[02:11:49] <selwyn> lol
[02:12:06] <selwyn> why is it so convolutes
[02:12:08] <selwyn> convoluted
[02:12:28] <gilberth> Because Knuth' believes in text not in ASTs.
[02:15:42] <gilberth> Well, PASCAL does not allow say "CONST FOO=10+3;" It must be just a number. So a lot of defines, which are constants, are resolved in TANGLE, with the macros. E.g. "@d num_foo = 100" and then "array [0..num_foo-1] of integer;" TANGLE does the math for PASCAL.
[02:18:06] <selwyn> i see
[02:19:48] <gilberth> I am somewhat stuck.
[02:39:37] <lotuseater> oh
[02:40:13] <lotuseater> he believes more in that programs must be written for humans
[02:41:23] <pjb> gilberth: some used pascal with the C pre-processor.
[02:41:31] <gilberth> This is orthogonal to having an AST. I consider string concatenation hacks not particular readable.

[02:43:01] <gilberth> pjb: Sure. Not so Knuth. And he also doesn't use diff(1) or patch(1).
[02:43:48] <lotuseater> was that in existence at that time?
[02:44:39] <gilberth> Anyhow, my Pascal allows expressions in places like "array [0..n-1] of blah" say, or in CONST. Also for case/of. But: In the first stage I want to emulate TANGLE and verify I get the exact same list of tokens. Only then I'll hack that into sth more sane.
[02:45:19] <lotuseater> good approach
[02:46:30] <gilberth> lotuseater: 1982? I would guess so.
[02:46:39] <lotuseater> o_O
[02:47:12] <lotuseater> TeX was crafted since 1968 and "ready" for use in 1978
[02:47:46] <lotuseater> on YT there are also *very* old lectures with him about TeX
[02:48:03] <gilberth> Hmm. This explains why he was so proud of using ASCII. In the time of 6-bit character sets.

[03:32:49] <gilberth> This is what happens, when you believe in strings too much: There is @{ and @} to comment out code, Knuth is careful to watch for PASCAL comments inside @{ @}, but trips on "@{ writeln('}'); @}" => "{writeln('}');}" which is not what you want, the "}" inside the string should have been escaped somehow. sigh
[03:34:34] <gilberth> I call that a bug.
[03:38:27] <pjb> gilberth: so he doesn't know parsing either?
[03:44:10] <gilberth> pjb: As I said, he believes in strings.

[03:54:09] <gilberth> Really? Parsing was not yet invented? And besides, you spot such fallacies all over the place even in these days. The most prominent is constructing SQL queries.
[03:54:09] <pjb> lotuseater: s-exps were invented in 1958.
[03:54:35] <pjb> gilberth: Parsing was invented in 1960 (fortran, algol).
[03:55:09] <lotuseater> I didn't say it was discovered at that time.
[03:55:24] <gilberth> Or any JS lib, which constructs CSS values from strings. But then all this web stuff is a mess syntax-wise. Would have been better to have just one s-expr syntax for all and be set.
[03:56:20] <gilberth> This might happen and will be called the hottest shit ever.

[17:00:22] <gilberth> I wonder, why Knuth didn't use parenthesis for his macros. There is a difference between "@d foo == 100+3" and "@d bar = 100+3". The former is textually replaced, the latter computes 100+3 and makes that the expansion. Hence, "-foo" => "-97" and "-bar" => "-103".
[17:00:39] <hayley> The layout is miserable, yes, I think it was more designed with the simpler IRs in mind.
[17:00:59] <gilberth> I mean, cpp macros are pure textual, so you'd say "#define baz (100+3)"

[17:07:44] <gilberth> shka: Well, they are successful in destructing the separation of powers, like the making the jurisdiction depending on the government. And thus abolishing the foundation of democracy. But I must confess I don't really follow news.
[17:08:48] * hayley puts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G-YVPtA3GQ on the jukebox yet again
[17:08:49] <gilberth> shka: Anyhow, I would get mad at that.
[17:09:09] <shka> gilberth: public television has para-documentary series about how bad justice system is 
[17:09:34] * gilberth is reminded that his little bot doesn't listen to action messages yet.
[17:10:02] <shka> and it was made simply to channel anger toward judges 
[17:10:22] <gilberth> shka: Bad from whoms perspective?
[17:10:35] <shka> "the people"
[17:10:54] <shka> quotations because it is not just people
[17:11:01] <shka> but the concept of "the people"
[17:11:23] <gilberth> Ah, what people? The people who don't like democracy? sigh
[17:12:11] <shka> eh, i better go back to coding
[17:12:22] <shka> i can rant for hours about this shit
[17:12:30] <hayley> 'When the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called "the People's Stick".'
[17:12:58] <gilberth> I really don't get the Polish development given their early protest against the communist regime in the 80s.
[17:13:16] <selwyn> hayley: depends how kinky they are
[17:13:28] * selwyn hands himself in to the horny police
[17:13:28] <hayley> 😳
[17:13:37] <shka> selwyn: bonk
[17:13:51] <hayley> selwyn: But then they would despise the non-DS-ness of it being a people's stick.
[17:14:13] <shka> gilberth: it is not that simple, during the 90s transformation to the free market economy a lot of people got disposed 
[17:14:15] <gilberth> What is police doing here in our café?
[17:14:37] <shka> circa 2000 unemployment was around 20%

[17:14:42] -ixelp- Cheap Trick - Dream Police - YouTube
[17:15:21] <shka> long story short, some of the older generation are simply angry at this whole era
[17:15:30] <gilberth> shka: Sure. Well, east Germany also has a tendency towards the right. Which I also don't get.
[17:17:32] <shka> gilberth: thing is, after the reunification large corporations got access to the new markets
[17:18:03] <shka> and the local, small scale (and outdated) industry simply could not compete 
[17:18:52] <shka> this is a problem because Poland deindustrialized rapidly
[17:19:13] <shka> so rapidly in fact, that for a decade we could postpone investing into new powerplants
[17:19:23] <shka> because less factories = less energy needed
[17:19:42] <shka> anyway, a lot of bitter people
[17:19:54] <selwyn> that´s a shame
[17:20:06] <shka> selwyn: visit the north England bro :P
[17:20:24] <shka> and tell me how that brexit thing is goind
[17:20:26] <shka> anyway
[17:20:53] <shka> and there are also some younger generation idiotic nationlolo which i blame on the education system
[17:21:02] <gilberth> In late 80s my mother had close contact with some Polish people in the vicinity of Solidarnosc (sp?). Some visted us one in a while. There where however some false impression about how life would be in the west. They believe anybody would live in prosperity. /us being one of the more wealthy people didn't help.
[17:21:47] <shka> though the younger generation seem to prefer "Konfederacja" currently 
[17:22:02] <shka> which are more radical and openly racist/homophobic 
[17:22:17] <gilberth> Oh dear.
[17:22:18] <shka> and generally speaking, edgy 
[17:22:39] <shka> gilberth: don't worry about those guys, they would implode if they would ever came to power
[17:22:45] <gilberth> Why would young people think like that?
[17:23:01] <shka> but the effect is that PiS also tries to show how fucking edgy they are 
[17:23:30] <gilberth> shka: ok. When will you leave?
[17:23:48] <shka> i don't want to leave
[17:23:54] <shka> i want this mess to be sorted out
[17:24:05] <shka> and i think that this time may be near
[17:24:16] <gilberth> Sure, who wants to leave?
[17:24:48] <gilberth> shka: You believe so? Will that madness be over?
[17:24:55] <pjb> gilberth: don't worry, since prosperity is a linear function of the use of energy (and machines), and since we're  reducing fast our use of energy, people will be poor and dead real soon.
[17:25:01] <shka> gilberth: for a time
[17:25:21] <pjb> gilberth: perhaps not Polish, I've seen they planed to build nuclear power plants to replace their use of coal.
[17:25:53] <gilberth> pjb: Yes, don't get me started on the so called "Green" party, which wants to reduce prosperity, they just don't call it that way.
[17:26:56] <gilberth> pjb: Their solution to climate change: Taxes, taxes, and more taxes.
[17:27:15] <shka> gilberth: i think that PiS is going to loose soon, but i have no idea how much time cleanup of this fallout will take
[17:27:33] <shka> gilberth: taxes is part of the solution
[17:28:17] <shka> *are part
[17:28:21] <gilberth> shka: Was the constitution changed to implement the destruction of the indepndance of jurisdiction?
[17:28:21] <shka> stupid english
[17:28:35] <shka> PiS does not have majority to do that
[17:28:54] <gilberth> shka: Yes, make heating so expensive, that only wealthy people could effort that. Works, I guess.
[17:29:17] <shka> and the current constitutional tribunal is IMHO illegal, and so are the rulings
[17:29:23] <shka> on top of being FUCKING STUPID
[17:29:46] <shka> so that is non-factor
[17:30:18] <gilberth> Well, I was asking because that would make restoration more difficult.
[17:30:34] <shka> but the mess in the justice system needs to be cleaned up, general prosecutor and the justice minister jobs should be obviously separate
[17:31:00] <shka> so, you know, they can't simply press the abort button when political is prosecuted 
[17:31:16] <gilberth> Yes, the jurisdiction should not be part of the government.
[17:31:26] <shka> then there is education system that needs to be sorted out, again
[17:31:59] <shka> and you gotta need investigate every single prosecutor and judge 
[17:32:11] <shka> because some of those fuckers are simply figureheads
[17:32:28] <gilberth> Were schools any good in anytime?
[17:32:28] <shka> same for the police 
[17:32:49] <shka> gilberth: less bad
[17:32:56] <gilberth> shka: Seems like you really face some f***ing mess.
[17:33:17] <shka> i think that there is no saving of the public TV at this point
[17:33:25] <shka> so i would rather get rid of it
[17:33:50] <gilberth> Is there private TV in Poland?
[17:33:55] <shka> yeah
[17:34:01] <shka> obviously
[17:34:40] <shka> but public TV was used as a propaganda tool for multiple governments
[17:34:51] <shka> this one is simply the most vile
[17:35:06] <gilberth> Sure.
[17:35:46] <selwyn> i don´t trust established green parties, they are very open to being co-opted over other issues by conservative parties who hate the environment
[17:35:54] <shka> anyway, then there is the future, we gotta build that nuclear power plant and not just talk about it 
[17:36:11] <shka> and address the debt problem
[17:36:36] <shka> there are multiple other things i would to be changed 
[17:36:57] <shka> and oddly enough i vote for the reddest party in Poland currently
[17:37:01] <gilberth> selwyn: Our Green party fits with the conservative party pretty well.
[17:37:07] <shka> which is weird, but they make the most sense
[17:37:57] <gilberth> shka: You talk of the left?
[17:37:57] <shka> it is bad when communist are having reasonable ideas :P
[17:38:01] <shka> gilberth: yeah
[17:38:07] <selwyn> at the height of brexit shithousery in parliament, the green party proposed simply scrapping the government and replacing it with a government of women
[17:38:42] <selwyn> the government wasn´t keen on this idea
[17:39:02] <shka> gilberth: anyway, i shit you not, currently the most leftist party in Poland seems to be the most reasonable 
[17:39:03] <gilberth> Indeed, that is funny. There are exactly two I would ever consider voting: The left (Die Linke) and the [neo-]liberal party (FDP).
[17:39:47] <shka> which is absurd but here we are
[17:40:01] <gilberth> Reason is simple: Both parties value freedom and liberal rights; The others do not and happily pass unconstitutional laws.
[17:40:21] <shka> oh, this is interesting point
[17:40:35] <gilberth> Luckily our jurisdiction works and laws would be abolished by the high court routinely.
[17:40:47] <shka> i envy you
[17:41:15] <selwyn> this is the good horseshoe theory
[17:42:09] <gilberth> Which states what?
[17:42:56] <shka> gilberth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv9rC69VMOI
[17:42:57] -ixelp- Horseshoe Theory || Centricide 5 - YouTube
[17:44:06] <selwyn> a rather lazy idea that the political spectrum is shaped as a horseshoe, with far left and far right meeting in a locus of extremism
[17:44:14] <selwyn> big brain centrists are the most intelligent and correct, you see
[17:44:28] <hayley> "One pass makes code larger, and one pass makes it small, and the ones that Clozure gives you don't do anything at all, go ask Marco when he's ten VOPs tall"
[17:44:40] <hayley> Fish hook theory?
[17:44:54] <selwyn> i have heard of that recently but idk what it is
[17:45:27] <shka> 'every extreme is on the same team'
[17:46:31] <gilberth> Indeed.
[17:46:44] * hayley uploaded an image: (81KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yuzxqzcFGPoTUoVbqWfoXAVb/1200px-Fish_Hook_Theory.png >
[17:47:13] <shka> gilberth: the nazbol shall defeat you
[17:48:11] <hayley> .oO( TIL I, an egoist telekommunist with real OOP characteristics, am on the same team as a nazbol with procedural characteristics )
[17:48:20] <gilberth> Anyhow, I am here on the political compass: <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/pc.png> A region not really covered by any party.
[17:49:24] <gilberth> I am pretty left for a damn capitalist and employer. :)
[17:49:58] <hayley> He still will not read the Unique and its Property.
[17:50:41] <gilberth> hayley: I first have to read the GC bible, which is on its way.
[17:51:12] <hayley> Did you get the original German manuscript for that too?
[17:51:45] <gilberth> I don't believe the original is in German.
[17:52:40] <hayley> Also, have you started a milk shop yet?
[17:52:44] <gilberth> Which reminds me of a silly textbook at the uni, which translated every English CS term to German. That was pretty hard to read.
[17:53:01] <gilberth> Milk?
[17:53:39] <shka> how to say "garbage collector" in german?
[17:53:51] <gilberth> Garbage Collector.
[17:54:24] <shka> but in GERMAN
[17:54:32] <gilberth> We don't really translate CS terms. This is very uncommon.
[17:54:58] <gilberth> "Automatische Speicherbereinigung" idk.
[17:55:02] <shka> like it
[17:55:12] <hayley> Müllabfuhr
[17:55:48] <gilberth> A stack is a "Kellerspeicher". But again: You don't really say that.
[17:56:14] <hayley> Müllabfuhr für automatische Ablaufverfolgungsmarkierungen
[17:56:23] * hayley thinks Google Translate made German lorem ipsum
[17:56:33] <selwyn> gilberth: someone wrote an essay about particle physics without any english loanwords
[17:56:35] <gilberth> Heh.
[17:56:41] <selwyn> which is to say they translated english into english
[17:56:44] <selwyn> > For most of its being, mankind did not know what things are made of, but could only guess. With the growth of worldken, we began to learn, and today we have a beholding of stuff and work that watching bears out, both in the workstead and in daily life.
[17:56:59] <hayley> The input string was "automatic tracing mark-region garbage collection"
[17:58:09] <gilberth> Where did the "ablauf" came from? That doesn't make sense. But perhaps from "tracing".
[17:58:28] <hayley> Inkrementelle Kopiensammlung von Baker
[17:58:57] <gilberth> Anyhow in said book it was "Rolleingabegerät" for mouse.
[17:59:41] <shka> gerat :D
[17:59:43] <gilberth> Which is even wrong, modern mice don't have balls anymore.
[18:00:00] <shka> ze Germanz lovez ze gerat
[18:00:01] <hayley> "Doligez-Leroy On-the-Fly Multiprozessor Generations-Garbage Collector" boring.
[18:00:45] * gilberth doesn't even know how to translate "on-the-fly".
[18:01:43] <hayley> "Gute schiesse [Dijkstra, Lamport et al 1978]"
[18:02:19] <gilberth> "schiesse" is no word.
[18:02:57] * hayley doesn't have the ligature for ss
[18:03:12] * gilberth is adventurous and on his way to the kitchen for more coffee.
[18:03:51] <gilberth> Even "schieße" is no word either. "Scheiße" is and is "shit", literally.
[18:05:32] <hayley> Sounds like a word to me.
[18:06:18] <pjb> hayley: case sensitive!
[18:07:32] <gilberth> And "ie" /= "ei".
[18:08:15] <hayley> pjb: (setf read-case :invert)
[18:08:30] <hayley> Right, I can't spell.
[18:09:17] <gilberth> "schiesse" would be conditional tense for "schiessen". Which is "to shoot".
[18:10:18] <gilberth> hayley: Your "*"'s turned into italic.
[18:12:04] <gilberth> Anyhow, I guess I will need to clean up the kitchen. Again. My cousin is having a bad time and lulls himself in watching TV^WNetflix all the time, as if that would help.
[18:13:37] <gilberth> So, it's garbage collection time. Unfortunatly neither generational nor incremental.
[18:14:04] <hayley> Trip the breaker and have a parallel GC.
[18:14:49] <gilberth> lol. As if that would work. I could also configure the router to block Netflix.
[18:15:40] <gilberth> I mean, I need electrical power, too. The battery lasts a few hours only.
[18:16:33] <gilberth> Can't we have micro nuclear power? Would that work?
[18:17:36] <gilberth> Or: How small could a nuclear reactor be? Is there a limit?
[18:17:40] <edgar-rft> isn't the nucleus small enough?
[18:18:13] <gilberth> egdar-rft: Compared to electrons, it's still pretty huge.
[18:19:15] * gilberth uses cmtt10 for hacking.
[18:20:17] <edgar-rft> but would nuclear physics still work if the nucleus were 1000 times smaller?
[18:20:32] <pjb> gilberth: yes, If my micro you mean 1 MW; that's what's planed for Thorium Fluoride power plants. Small village or individual power.
[18:20:51] <pjb> edgar-rft: the size doesn't matter. The cross section matters.  ;-)
[18:21:24] <edgar-rft> my nucleus is bigger than yours
[18:21:26] <pjb> edgar-rft: the cross section depends on the interaction fields.
[18:22:44] <edgar-rft> and sorry, "micro" means a million times smaller, not only 1000
[18:23:16] <hayley> gilberth: /me also uses Computer Modern for hacking.
[18:23:55] <hayley> One thing that people think I use that looks good for once. Though that person was an old friend who helped me with documentation and thus knew some TeX, so survivorship bias and all.
[18:24:26] <pjb> gilberth: well, the Pu reactors/batteries used to power the sondes such as the martian sondes, can be considered "micro nuclear power plants… 
[18:24:27] * edgar-rft uses a horse for hacking :-)
[18:24:44] <gilberth> hayley: Have you found a proper .ttf file?

[18:25:01] <gilberth> pjb: That is not fission power.
[18:25:03] <pjb> Just mere decay of Pu.
[18:25:07] <pjb> This is fission.
[18:25:21] <gilberth> Radioactive decay.
[18:25:23] <pjb> Physics…
[18:25:51] <gilberth> Not splitting atoms on intent.
[18:25:53] <hayley> gilberth: https://cm-unicode.sourceforge.io/index.html is good enough for me.
[18:25:54] -ixelp- Computer Modern Unicode fonts
[18:26:27] <gilberth> hayley: Mine just has the 128 chars TeX encoding. Good for displaying DVI files though.
[18:26:28] <selwyn> recently i had cause to recall the nuclear salt water rocket
[18:26:36] <selwyn> how dangerous would it be to build/use actually
[18:26:57] <selwyn> you can´t really test it on planet earth
[18:27:05] <pjb> (239)Pu -> (235)U + (4)He + energy with 1/2 life of 24100 years is perfect fission.
[18:27:10] <hayley> Though iirc mine also includes bitmaps for 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16px heights as well as vectors.
[18:28:34] <selwyn> i agree that radioactive decay is not fission
[18:29:47] <selwyn> hm, wiki says that decay does count as fission
[18:30:26] <selwyn> you don´t have to induce it with a neutron
[18:30:53] <hayley> .oO( I can't be bothered waiting for decay, can't we just emit all the energy at once )
[18:30:54] <selwyn> in order for the reaction to be a fission reaction
[18:30:58] <gilberth> hayley: Thanks, but the metrics don't look right.
[18:31:43] <hayley> I wouldn't count on it being compatible with the TeX font, right, but I otherwise find it nice enough to use.
[18:32:29] <hayley> All the Netfarm presentations use some olde-looking traced movable type font for titles and CMU for body text.
[18:32:57] <gilberth> Here it's rendered too tall and too narrow. That is inter-character space is a little tight.
[18:34:22] <gilberth> But they did a good job on pulling all kinds of unicode chars in. Even "€" is there :)
[18:34:44] <hayley> It's good enough to fool the average ELS viewer, not to be pixel perfect.
[18:37:38] <gilberth> The one I found is just the original TeX font, which doesn't have accented chars. But then, I don't need them. The "↑" however is there, which I need for Pascal.
[18:38:50] <gilberth> The digraph^Wunigraph for "↑" is "@" per the ISO standard, which I didn't know and haven't seen. All implementations, I saw, just use "^".
[18:40:18] *** Joins: waleee (~waleee@2001:9b0:216:8200:d457:9189:7843:1dbd)
[18:40:32] <gilberth> Which makes sense as "^" is what was "↑" initially.
[18:42:34] <hayley> Macsyma uses @ still.
[18:43:14] <gilberth> For what?
[18:43:45] <hayley> ('f(x))@1 = x % and as I had no other characters in mind, I used @ for Netfarm namespaces^Wnamespace
[18:44:28] <hayley> Or maybe it was for defstruct...
[18:45:06] <gilberth> Well, I saw "@" used for slot access, like (@ foo x) = foo.x
[18:45:33] <hayley> Yep.
[18:45:52] <hayley> defstruct(a(b)); a(2)@b = 2
[18:46:43] <gilberth> IIRC Parenscript uses that. My "Klammerschrift" uses that too.
[18:47:55] <shka> selwyn: nuclear salt water reactor?
[18:47:58] <shka> what is that?
[18:48:19] <shka> oh, nuclear salt water rocket
[18:48:24] <shka> yeah, i read about it
[18:48:28] <shka> xD
[18:48:31] <hayley> The one namespace being inbuilt@schema - idk why I didn't go for a dot, but : and / were already taken in the text format.
[18:48:42] <shka> one of the more interesting nuclear rockets
[18:49:02] <shka> but i still think that fission product nuclear rocket is cooler 
[18:49:58] * hayley needs to kill off the text format some day.
[18:49:58] <shka> oh, sorry, fission fragment rocket https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission-fragment_rocket
[18:51:04] <shka> it is like angry, steroid fed brother of the ion engines
[19:01:19] <selwyn> shka: i see what you mean
[19:11:59] <selwyn> perhaps it violates nuclear treaties to build such things
[19:13:42] <shka> i am not aware

[19:27:17] <nocturnal-one> lotuseater: So what do you think about that owl I borrowed?
[19:28:37] <lotuseater> looks good, why?
[19:28:43] <nocturnal-one> Is there also a German version of LotusScript, like there is for VB.
[19:28:52] <lotuseater> omg
[19:29:00] <nocturnal-one> lotuseater: Thanks. I just wanted to get feedback.
[19:29:18] <lotuseater> or better now not "oh my god" but "omd" for oh my dialect
[19:30:23] <nocturnal-one> lotuseater: As a student a good friend of mine had a part time job hacking German Visual Basic. "WENN X>0 DANN ..." "SOLANGE N>0 TUE dies und das." Hilarious.
[19:30:35] <ck_> such a pain D:
[19:30:40] <ck_> especially the documentation

[19:32:24] <contrapunctus> That's something that really interests me 😀
[19:33:04] <lotuseater> I was thinking about some times when introducing pupils to programming who are not yet so capable of English.
[19:33:34] <contrapunctus> Would an Arabic translation of Lisp use RPN?
[19:33:44] <nocturnal-one> IAR = Inhalt des Addressregisters = CAR. IVR = "Inhalt des Verminderungsregisters" lol.
[19:33:55] <lotuseater> but that also would require other stuff to be signaled in German, or the doc strings
[19:34:21] <lotuseater> nocturnal-one: no, we will name CAR just "Auto"
[19:34:28] <nocturnal-one> Well, CLISP has a German translation. Not the CL symbols though. Still strange, very strange.
[19:34:46] <lotuseater> ohh
[19:34:53] <nocturnal-one> And CDR = "cudder" = "cutter" = "Schneider"?
[19:35:01] <lotuseater> yeah why not
[19:35:50] <nocturnal-one> CADR = "Schneiderauto" and CDAR = "Autochneider" :)
[19:36:15] <lotuseater> I like that part in the real SICP lectures where the professor explains how to speak out merged CAR and CDR forms out loud. CADDAR := ka-di-di-dar
[19:36:41] <nocturnal-one> Anyhow, I always use English for my machines. I hate it when some parts are in German and others are not. "Are you sure? [Ja] [Nein] [Vielleicht]" Brrr.

[19:42:14] <lotuseater> gilberth: where do you come from?
[19:42:18] <selwyn> i don´t think it does use rpn, the only different is that it is prefix notation read right to left
[19:42:22] <selwyn> *difference
[19:43:04] <gilberth> I never tried, I value my thong and won't attempt to break it by speaking without vowels.

[19:43:58] <gilberth> tongue, even. ;grr
[19:44:02] <lotuseater> hehe
[19:44:11] <contrapunctus> So how might one define translations for symbols in Common Lisp in a portable way?
[19:44:12] <gilberth> lotuseater: Only written that way.
[19:44:45] <lotuseater> contrapunctus: just defining aliases wouldn't be enough
[19:45:29] <lotuseater> (setf (symbol-function 'addiere-eins) #'1+)
[19:46:18] <selwyn> you have to render sexps in a locale-dependent way e.g rtl or top to bottom
[19:46:27] <lotuseater> (setf (macro-function 'definiere-funktion) (macro-function 'defun))
[19:46:37] <selwyn> translating symbols isn´t enough
[19:46:52] <lotuseater> selwyn: as i said
[19:47:21] <gilberth> Funktion? Abbildung!
[19:47:29] <lotuseater> ah you mean dumping it as a real text

[20:26:31] <lotuseater> I just know explicitely on the LispWorks site, the terminal version of it doesn't.
[20:26:33] <gilberth> Ok. I think, I have it now: (eval-web-string "{ hallo } -100 -+- 42 { the magic nuumber } + {adjust} 100") => "{ hallo } 42   { the magic nuumber }  {adjust} "
[20:29:54] <gilberth> selwyn: willing [to do sth], easy. But with the connotation of agreement or force used.
[20:30:50] <gilberth> Anyhow, I don't care, I encode all my files in UTF-8 since recently. If your Lisp does not cope with it: Get another one. Set.
[20:37:01] <gilberth> I still don't know at which level I need to plug that in. TANGLE does "a:=+-b" => "a:=-b" e.g.

[21:11:04] <gilberth> The time when you use Google to find your own files ...
[21:11:08] <shka> because i am of this opinion 
[21:11:51] <selwyn> i think so but i think everything should be lispy :p
[21:11:52] <lotuseater> a few weeks ago I wanted to make a literate program with APL fonts in the code blocks into PDF. it signaled no monospace font of that. found something, metafont compiled it (just a small font subset) but it didn't look so nice
[21:11:54] <selwyn> why tex in particular
[21:12:10] <shka> selwyn: i don't need assembly to be lispy
[21:12:19] <selwyn> the text based macro system is annoying for serious use
[21:12:20] * gilberth likes his defun.sty, but really doesn't believe in dead trees anymore.
[21:12:30] <lotuseater> looks great gilberth
[21:12:55] <gilberth> selwyn: Indeed. Let's see where I get.

[21:15:06] <shka> now i think that lisp is actually orcs
[21:15:22] <gilberth> Orcs?

[21:15:35] <selwyn> lol
[21:16:14] <gilberth> Heh. So not for me. I am as unchad, as you can get.
[21:16:19] <shka> and they can't be permanently defeated, they always return :P 
[21:17:09] <gilberth> Well, A pity that CLIM confuses typesetting with display lists. I'll solve that eventually.
[21:17:42] * gilberth started hacking CLIM because he needed a GUI lib for Closure.
[21:18:17] *** Joins: lad (~lad@user/lad)
[21:18:41] <gilberth> So I'd like to see more CSSish features in CLIM. Closure version minus one used its render engine to render the GUI too. Which worked quite well. I should see, whether I could get that running again.
[21:19:08] <selwyn> orcs also always end up losing against the good guys (c++/java/other mainstream languages)
[21:19:44] <gilberth> Heh.
[21:21:11] <gilberth> Actually I never cared whether CL is popular. It's a lost battle anyway and we just need to wait until some mainstream language fully converged to CL. Will happen eventually and will then be called the hottest thing since sliced bread.
[21:21:41] <pjb> gilberth: optimist! It won't occur before singularity!
[21:22:05] <ck_> sliced bread isn't that hoy
[21:22:07] <selwyn> i simply enjoy everyone else using curly braces
[21:22:11] <selwyn> let them have meme syntax
[21:22:11] <gilberth> pjb: Hmm, yes, the singularity may be first.
[21:23:28] <gilberth> ck_: Stick into into a toaster.
[21:23:46] <gilberth> * it into
[21:25:21] <gilberth> selwyn: Actually TeX internally has a dynamically typed 'node' data type. Perhaps I could carry that over to being a real object. Luckily Pascal is statically typed, so that some analysis shouldn't be too hard.
[21:36:22] <MichaelRaskin> gilberth: are you sure anything will ever come closer than Julia?
[21:36:51] <MichaelRaskin> (it has a bit more tooling maturation to do before becoming fully mainstream, I guess)

[21:49:49] * gilberth doesn't know Julia. He does know one, but that is a damn sexy woman from the wrong side.
[21:51:05] * gilberth has a lesbian detector. Or lesbians have a gilberth-detector.
[21:51:24] <ck_> Julia has "Femtolisp", which is I believe a scheme and the parser / syntax description
[21:51:46] <contrapunctus> shka: horny police? O.o
[21:51:53] <gilberth> Oh Scheme again. sigh

[21:53:45] <contrapunctus> gilberth: CL is significantly more work to implement than Scheme, right? No surprises there are fewer implementations, I guess...
[21:53:48] <ck_> gilberth: that was in jest, Julia itself is not very like scheme. Here's one article https://tamaspapp.eu/post/common-lisp-to-julia/

[21:57:17] <contrapunctus> I was actually wondering whether I should take inspiration from DSSSL and implement a side-effect-free Scheme for document scripting in my format...but perhaps that effort is better spent helping beach set up Clostrum & co. for implementation-independent sandboxing 🤔
[21:58:08] <contrapunctus> gilberth: interesting...

[22:05:30] <lotuseater> about the detector
[22:05:59] <lotuseater> ah I'm happy, the printer of my roommate worked out by default with lp
[22:06:32] <gilberth> A lot of things in CL were just libraries initially. FORMAT, the pretty printer, LOOP, CLOS itself. CL just has no specified core. Which could be small.
[22:07:35] <gilberth> lotuseater: Yes, this always happens to me. I find some woman attractive to learn that she is lesbian only later. I would need to retune that.
[22:08:32] <gilberth> BTW I once practically lived at an otherwise Lesbian shared apartment. Kitchen was a mess, too.
[22:09:35] <lotuseater> damn
[22:12:06] * gilberth attempts to have an LALR(1) grammer to go through otherwise uninteresting tokens to just pick up those constant sum terms.
[22:13:29] <ck_> only very recently did I learn where the term 'bitbucket' came from. I wonder how far back some 'modern' terms can be traced
