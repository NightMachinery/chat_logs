[14:02:53] <Mitaka> redirect it to isfreenodedeadyet
[14:03:30] <Mitaka> Or plaster it full of childishly edited pictures of andrew.
[14:06:51] <aab_> make sure your identity is hidden on a whois domain lookup
[14:08:31] <bookworm> doesn't help you if a lawyer comes calling
[14:09:09] <bookworm> the registrar will forward the complaint or unblind the actual hoster
[15:08:52] <aab_> andrew would probably do that as well
[15:08:55] <aab_> so be careful

[23:17:13] <Max-P> Yeah that's pretty typical of him
[23:18:35] <Max-P> He's most likely bipolar or borderline, smokes weed all the time and also does cocaine and alcohol, so that behavior is not too surprising especially when he's in "mania" state
