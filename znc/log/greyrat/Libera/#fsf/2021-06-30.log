[06:14:22] <bone-baboon> I just tried to sign up for a GitHub (Microsoft) account so I could submit a bug report to a project that has it's bug tracker on GitHub.
[06:14:23] <bone-baboon> I had planed to use free software to interact with GitHub using a terminal web browser, git, and one of hub <https://github.com/github/hub>, GitHub cli <https://github.com/cli/cli> or forge <https://magit.vc/manual/forge/Introduction.html#Introduction>.
[06:14:23] <bone-baboon> The terminal web browser I am using does not have JavaScript.

[07:27:01] <orbatos_> bone-baboon, you could try browsh 
[07:27:24] <tpefreedom> So the TL:DR version is that Github requires nonfree JS  and thus sucks?
[07:27:33] <tpefreedom> oh
[07:27:34] <orbatos_> it's microsoft
[07:27:44] <tpefreedom> *TLDR
[07:27:50] <tpefreedom> Microsoft sucks too.
[07:28:30] <tpefreedom> Their new UI is a giant mac os ripoff. If people wanted a mac, they would have bought a fxcking mac. It's just a dumb cashgrab to keep windows relavent.
[07:28:57] <orbatos_> tbh, something *like* recaptcha is pretty necessary these days, and almost none of those mechanisms work without javascript. You would need ot make something custom
[07:29:53] <tpefreedom> Not that I like apple either. Microsoft and windows 11 is just ripping off apple's ui and ux work.
[07:31:01] <tpefreedom> Both apple and microsoft fxcking suck.
[07:32:49] <bone-baboon> orbatos_: Thanks for the browsh suggestion. My understanding is that using browsh would shift the execution of the JavaScript to another computer.
[07:34:05] <orbatos_> bone-baboon, sure, yeah it's kind of cool, though can be quirky. It's a separate profile in Firefox too
[07:35:25] <orbatos_> tpefreedom, Re:W11, In this case they're barely changing anything really. The real issue is they intend to break backwards compatibility again. Forced WDDM drivers, new processors, forced activated TPM , etc
[07:35:49] <orbatos_> DX12 as a requirement for the gpu
[07:36:20] <orbatos_> imo it's to combat linux users and Wine, as well as for ce upgrades to less free hardware

[07:38:57] <tpefreedom> IMHO secure boot isn't specifically windows in it's entirity. You can use any other os who is developed by people willing to give Microsoft some cash. Either way, Microsoft (Micro$hit) gets a piece of that sweet green pie.
[07:40:58] <dragestil> how does browsh shift js execution to another computer?
[07:41:22] <tpefreedom> Microsoft is more than happy to allow people to use fedora or ubuntu since they have devs paying microsoft what amounts to tribute.
[07:41:32] <tpefreedom> Either way microsoft wins.
[07:44:16] <tpefreedom> I'm guessing that the only reason microsoft isn't pressuring manufacturers to remove the option to disable secure boot is because it would anger all the businesses running servers on distros that don't pay up.
[07:44:18] <jxself> Not necessarily. In the world of Secure Boot this can be turned off and/or the computer's owner can decide what keys should be enrolled/trusted.
[07:46:52] <tpefreedom> I think at least some systems don't let you decide.
[07:47:19] <jxself> If such a scenario exists that's not Secure Boot.
[07:47:29] <jxself> Rather it's Restricted Boot. See https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/ for the difference.
[07:48:12] <tpefreedom> Wouldn't restricted boot be a subset of secure boot?
[07:49:24] <jxself> Nope. They should be mutually exclusive, revolving around the question: Who ultimately decides what keys are trusted?
[07:49:44] <jxself> If it's the user then it's Secure Boot. Otherwise it's Restricted Boot.
[07:50:10] <tpefreedom> Ok then.
[07:50:25] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)
[07:50:33] <tpefreedom> So microsoft has a tribute system based on restricted boot.

[07:51:23] <tpefreedom> I'm guessing libreboot has 'real' secure boot?
[07:52:11] <jxself> I've not yet found x86-based systems where it could not either be turned off or keys changed.
[07:52:50] <jxself> Libreboot doesn't do any crypto checking.
[07:53:04] <tpefreedom> So no secure boot?
[07:54:10] <jxself> I think there are ways to do it if you want.
[07:55:14] <orbatos_> As I recall it's an issue of signing keys, but hardened tpm is a pretty rare end user concern as encrypted boot covers most cases
[07:56:37] <tpefreedom> Well, windows 11 by microshit will require tpm chips. (I think at least 2.0) Just another excuse to make people buy new computers rather than upgrading their old one, thus microsoft gets to sell one more license.

[17:25:28] <TheCreeper> Might not be all that bad if Windows becomes a Linux distro. Windows 11 using KDE Plasma is certainly a step in the right direction.
[17:26:10] <murphnj> TheCreeper, That seems exceedingly unlikely.  
[17:27:17] <dragestil> I guess to make linux distro m$ has to create a non-copyleft userspace first
[17:27:20] <TheCreeper> murphnj, I've seen the screenshots I know what I saw!
[17:27:36] <murphnj> TheCreeper, They have had great success with a proprietary product that still enjoys a majority marketshare in desktop computing.   They are more likely to gain ground than lose it with their current path
[17:28:08] <murphnj> They are not using KDE plasma, just improving their style, which looks like it.
[17:28:32] <murphnj> With WSL, there will be less and less reason to use a GNU/linux desktop.

[17:35:32] <murphnj> But the claim that W11 is using KDE plamsa is?  You stated what they're doing, I stated an opinion on the future.

[17:36:01] <murphnj> What I stated was still just an opinion.
[17:37:19] <murphnj> I'm sorry, I'm going to get off the channel for now.  I'm in a grumpy mood after talking with a LUG that was talking way too much about W11.
[17:37:52] <murphnj> Alternating between wondering about how it works to how much it will drive people to GNU/Linux (my opinion: very little)
[17:38:20] <murphnj> My hope for Free software on the desktop, outside of proprietary jails, is fading.
[17:39:33] <murphnj> The standards are set very low for the propietary and familiar, and very high for GNU/Linux.  I don't see much opportunity for convincing people to switch.

[17:43:17] <murphnj> dstolfa, To answer your question, I've only dabbled.  But I keep hearing people that are pleased with being able to develop for Linux on it.  I'm not a developer, and don't have a Windows machine that I use regularly, so I don't really use it.
[17:45:56] <dstolfa> murphnj: ah i see. well, it's only really useful to run a few linuxy things on it, but trying to use it any way that touches the filesystem a lot, or transfer files between windows and linux, it goes horribly horribly wrong. i find it impossible to use and rather just have a VM if i ever do need to sit on a windows machine
[17:46:46] <dstolfa> WSL is a doomed project from the beginning, and WSL2 is extremely buggy and it's not trivial to fix without teaching the windows kernel all about linux-specific file attributes and the likes

If Microsoft and Google manage to marginalize Linux on the desktop, there will be less room for software Freedom.

[22:42:54] *** Joins: nekobyte_ (~nekobyte@user/nekobit)
[22:42:59] <Gnuman> pkal, It's my opinion that they have to maintain some semblance of backwards compatibility to keep their customer base. Otherwise, everyone will start switching to Apple M1's and completely abandon Windows.
[22:43:17] <Gnuman> well, not everyone.
[22:44:09] <Gnuman> but imagine if "new windows" couldn't run any windows 10 or older apps. There would be almost nothing keeping people locked-in to windows as opposed to linux or Mac.
[22:45:02] <Gnuman> and a huge selling point of windows is that I can run games written for windows 95, and I can still run Office 2007, and a bunch of other applications that are pay once for a lifetime license.
[22:45:14] <tpefreedom> I hope windows 11 turns into another ME or vista or 8.
[22:45:26] <Gnuman> I don't actually have a copy of Office 2007, but I imagine many businesses and individuals still do
[22:46:13] <Gnuman> but for those of us who remember the days when you bought software and could use it as long as you wanted, Windows needs to maintain as much backward compatibility as feasible

[22:47:37] <tpefreedom> Well, if you want to get a piece of software once and be able to run it as long as you want, GNU/Linux has you covered.
[22:47:54] <Gnuman> The new model is very SaaS. People use macs and expect their SaaS software (Adobe, etc.) to be ported over immediately. Apple throws backwards compatibility to the wind.
[22:48:25] <AppleGNU> Backwards compatibility to the wind? Rosetta 2 bro.
[22:48:31] <Gnuman> and I've spoken with rabid Apple fanboys.... they don't care that Apple has almost no backwards compatibility. "What about playing your old games?" "I want to play new games, not old"
[22:48:46] <Gnuman> AppleGNU, in about 2-3 years tops, Apple will ditch Rosetta 2
[22:48:53] <Gnuman> that's my personal prediction
[22:49:01] <AppleGNU> You may call me a fanboy, I've been called worse things. 
[22:49:17] <tpefreedom> IMO apple can go fuck itself.
[22:49:19] <Gnuman> AppleGNU, I'm not calling you a fanboy. You haven't acted like one yet =)
[22:50:10] <AppleGNU> Certain things do annoy me, like no sideloading on iPhone, or their stance on right to repair. 
[22:50:17] <Gnuman> Apple dumped Rosetta 1 only a few years after they made it.
[22:50:51] <Gnuman> now you could say that Rosetta 1 sucked, and it's good riddance, but consider Apple dumping 32-bit support.
[22:51:35] <AppleGNU> 32-bit is dinosaur news. Probably shouldn't be using programs with no security patches provided in years. 
[22:51:43] <Gnuman> they had no real reason to ditch 32-bit support. A lot of steam games became unplayable. VPN software became unusable. And the main gain they got out of it was saving some RAM and library storage space.

[22:52:22] <Gnuman> A lot of modern software was still 32-bit. Many companies decided to just do 32-bit builds instead of doing both 32-bit and 64-bit builds
[22:52:29] <Gnuman> It's definitely silly
[22:52:39] <AppleGNU> Steam has games with a 32-bit requirement? And they are succeeding how? 
[22:52:44] <Gnuman> but even some modern games have both 32-bit and 64-bit modes
[22:53:05] <Gnuman> AppleGNU, 32-bit games aren't like 16-bit games
[22:53:21] <Gnuman> most games only need 32 bit registers, so they never bother with 64-bit
[22:53:38] <Gnuman> and a lot of indie games want to run on older hardware to maximize their audience
[22:54:00] <Gnuman> I'm talking Windows, mostly
[22:54:03] <AppleGNU> With Windows going 64-bit only, I think all of these things will follow suit. 
[22:54:08] <Gnuman> AppleGNU, probably
[22:54:19] <Gnuman> a lot of indie steam games will probably issue updates to support 64-bit
[22:54:30] <Gnuman> AAA games released 10+ years ago will not release updates
[22:54:39] <tpefreedom> What about how apple doesn't give a **** about free software?
[22:54:54] <tpefreedom> Wait, windows is dropping 32bit?
[22:55:05] <Gnuman> tpefreedom, I'm pretty sure Apple does like free software. They like when it's free for them, but they don't extend those same freedoms to their customers.
[22:55:29] <Gnuman> see: Darwin, webkit
[22:55:53] <Gnuman> IIRC, Darwin is a fork of either netbsd or freebsd, and webkit is a fork of KHTML
[22:55:59] <tpefreedom> So pushover licenses.

[22:56:45] <tpefreedom> Gnuman, Darwin comes from Nextstep, which (I think) comes from bsd.
[22:56:51] <Gnuman> tpefreedom, ah, thanks
[22:57:16] <tpefreedom> And yet, webkit is still very usable in the free world.
[22:57:25] <tpefreedom> Either way, Mac OS is proprietary.
[22:57:35] <Gnuman> they had a fanbase that ran pure Darwin for a bit, but having no upstream support aside from "yes, thank you for fixing our paid OS for free", I think the Darwin community pretty much faded to nothing.
[22:57:45] <Gnuman> almost nothing, anyway
[22:58:36] <Gnuman> tpefreedom, yeah, webkit is very usable.
[22:58:40] <tpefreedom> You could probably create a libre mac os replacement if you ported budgie or pantheon to Darwin.

[22:59:51] <Gnuman> AppleGNU, fair enough. I just feel like Apple took the open source base, grew a paid OS out of it, and didn't really contribute back to open source. Darwin isn't really practical as a standalone OS

[23:04:07] <AppleGNU> I guess support for older Windows applications is still useful.
[23:04:31] <AppleGNU> Yeah. I use iOS and FreeBSD.
[23:04:33] <AppleGNU> sorry
[23:04:36] <AppleGNU> macOS and FreeBSD
[23:04:59] <Gnuman> honestly, it's amazing GNU/Linux has come so far forward. It competes directly with major proprietary operating systems. The only real struggle is apps that are OS-exclusive.

[23:05:41] <Gnuman> I'm not sure where we'd be without Redhat and a few other companies paying people to work on it.
[23:06:10] <dstolfa> Gnuman: i've never really needed anything i couldn't work around on a GNU/Linux system to be honest
[23:06:21] <Gnuman> also, I'm not trying to beat up on Apple. I think a lot of companies take the same path. Google and android, for instance.

[23:06:25] <tpefreedom> I'm guessing part of the reason that "Let's remake a proprietary os as libre" type projects fail is because you can just theme GNU/Linux or freebsd or whatever to look like that os.

[23:06:51] <Gnuman> dstolfa, The only thing I need Windows for is video games. If I didn't play video games, I'd be 100% linux.
[23:06:58] <AppleGNU> Red Hat may have numbered days. ref. previous IBM acquisitions. 
[23:07:15] <Gnuman> AppleGNU, yeah, I feel like IBM's one reorg away from destroying Redhat
[23:07:19] <dstolfa> Gnuman: i solve that by having a VM with passthrough on the rare occasion or just wine :P
[23:07:31] <Gnuman> disclaimer: I've worked at IBM and have seen how they operate from the inside.
[23:07:44] <AppleGNU> yikes
[23:07:45] <AppleGNU> lol
[23:07:57] <Gnuman> dstolfa, so in the end, you still need windows for your VM w/ passthrough =P
[23:08:05] *** Joins: typedef (~typedef@gateway/tor-sasl/typedef)
[23:08:15] <dstolfa> yeah, but it's off 99.99% of the time and doesn't eat much disk space
[23:08:34] <Gnuman> I'm probably at 90-95% GNU/linux usage myself
[23:08:54] <Gnuman> when the work day is done, I either play a linux-native game, or I reboot to windows to play an exclusive game
[23:08:55] <AppleGNU> I gave up on ReactOS when I couldn't install Pidgin or Cygwin without issues
[23:09:28] <AppleGNU> forgive me for hating their command prompt
[23:09:30] <dstolfa> i can do all my work and day to day activities on guix without any non-free software, so i'm happy about that
[23:09:31] <AppleGNU> :-)
[23:09:36] <dstolfa> and i do this both on my desktop and laptop
[23:09:39] <Gnuman> I haven't gotten a passthrough VM setup yet. I hear it's pretty nice these days
[23:09:52] <Gnuman> my laptop is 100% linux
[23:10:05] <Gnuman> I run arch linux on a 2013 Macbook Pro
[23:10:09] <AppleGNU> ah. your laptop is a kernel. 
[23:10:10] <AppleGNU> fun
[23:10:15] <AppleGNU> jk. sorry. lmao
[23:10:17] <Gnuman> lol
[23:10:32] <Gnuman> I get tired of writing GNU/linux
[23:10:43] <Gnuman> I'd say GNU, but that can mean anything
[23:10:48] <AppleGNU> I generally type Linux or LiGNUx when I'm being conciliatory 
[23:11:10] <Gnuman> GNU Hurd? GNU/linux? GNU/kfreebsd? GNU/darwin?
[23:11:17] <dstolfa> well, depending on what you're running it may really just be linux+whatever. my system has a lot of GNU in it (maybe even more GNU than linux? unsure), so it's definitely a GNU/Linux
[23:11:25] <specing> Gnuman: GNU+Linux is easier to write
[23:11:31] <lts> If you're going for long format, you may need to remember systemd
[23:11:37] <AppleGNU> LiGNUx is less time consuming to type
[23:11:42] <Gnuman> specing, GNU+Linux is just as hard to write as GNU/Linux
[23:11:54] <Gnuman> except my / is easier to reach than my +
[23:12:04] <AppleGNU> rms used to use "LiGNUx", and saw people didn't like it
[23:12:12] <dstolfa> lts: well, my system uses shepherd so i don't need to remember it, but systemd is a large portion of a lot of distros, so yeah :P
[23:12:38] <lts> I just learned today systemd-backlight exists.
[23:12:40] <specing> Gnuman: I find + easier to reach
[23:13:01] <AppleGNU> One clever use I saw was "LiGNUxorg"
