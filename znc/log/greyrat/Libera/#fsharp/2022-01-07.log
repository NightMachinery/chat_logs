[02:20:05] *** Quits: kuribas (~user@ptr-25vy0i9v3nmgstpk1ug.18120a2.ip6.access.telenet.be) (Quit: ERC (IRC client for Emacs 26.3))
[12:15:45] <MatthiasVance> Using VS Code now for F# .. going fully F# :o
[12:43:00] <biberu> nice
[12:43:06] <biberu> ionide?
[12:43:25] <biberu> how is the experience compared to vs?
[12:50:01] <MatthiasVance> I *love* the color scheme 
[12:50:08] <MatthiasVance> And the intellisense and autocompletion is better
[12:50:27] <MatthiasVance> Feels better, in VS I end up with FSI all the time (alt+enter :P )
[12:54:00] <MatthiasVance> Overall not sure I like it as IDE though
[12:54:05] <MatthiasVance> Just trying it out
[13:00:46] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Conclusion -> I mainly like the color scheme and the intellisense, everything else is .. hmmm
[13:02:20] <biberu> :)
[13:02:50] <MatthiasVance> But even installing a package is cumbersome
[13:02:56] <MatthiasVance> I like to get a list of them in my UI
[13:05:01] <biberu> hm, can dotnet search for packages?
[13:05:29] <MatthiasVance> yes
[13:05:38] <biberu> i don't think i've tried that, it's one of the few things i use the gui for
[13:05:42] <biberu> nice
[13:05:44] <MatthiasVance> same :)
[13:06:16] <biberu> that and project references
[13:06:24] <biberu> otherwise i edit project files manually
[13:23:20] <MatthiasVance> printfn should have an option to print an object graph :D
[13:53:47] <biberu> just finished reading another book on scala \o/
[14:00:08] <MatthiasVance> biberu: What is your takeaway from Scala?
[14:03:06] <biberu> looks like an interesting type system, it has e.g. type classes, and there are some good books with ideas that can be used for fp in general
[14:03:30] <biberu> didn't write anything real in it though, just fiddled a little with a container
[16:52:13] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Is there any equivalent already built in F#?
[16:52:23] <MatthiasVance> let select selector thing = thing |> selector
[16:52:32] <MatthiasVance> I want to have a pipeline where I select a property :D

[17:09:55] <biberu> MatthiasVance: not afaik
[17:10:04] <biberu> familiar with "lenses"?
[17:10:29] <biberu> someone probably wrote a lib, or at least, articles about those to do stuff like that
[17:10:44] <MatthiasVance> I was going to say this should be called "project" or something
[17:10:51] <MatthiasVance> I have heard the term "lenses" before
[17:12:53] <biberu> they are useful for reading from or updating deep structures
[19:55:36] <biberu> MatthiasVance: did you find anything interesting?
[19:56:07] <MatthiasVance> Have put it on my mental todo list :D
[19:56:30] <MatthiasVance> Now that I'm doing F# and not caring as much about all the edges of my system I can focus on the *actual* work
[19:56:33] <MatthiasVance> Which is a lot more challenging/fun

[23:15:27] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Do you know if there's a sum type of all primitive types?
[23:22:22] <biberu> MatthiasVance: not aware of one at least
[23:22:35] <MatthiasVance> Probably an edge case anyway :)
