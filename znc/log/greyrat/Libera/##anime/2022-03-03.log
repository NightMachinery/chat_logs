[00:26:41] <Bco1981> no idea
[00:28:20] <MootPoot> question is....should I get a 1tb card for my phone
[00:28:27] <MootPoot> I still have ~100gb left out of my 512
[00:28:54] <Bco1981> specs on my phone says it only supports up to 512
[00:29:01] <MootPoot> thats bs
[00:29:08] <Bco1981> also part of why i didn't go with the 1tb
[00:29:17] <MootPoot> they only do that because that's the only one available in the market at the time
[00:29:26] <MootPoot> the SDXC standard can address way more
[00:29:50] <Bco1981> nice... so when the price is right, i'm getting the 1tb.
[00:29:53] <MootPoot> I crammed a 64gb card in a blackberry that said it could only take 8gb
[00:29:56] <MootPoot> works fine
[00:30:02] <MootPoot> back when I still had a blackberry
[00:30:52] <Berlin36> noice
[00:30:54] <MootPoot> I'm not saying 100% it'll work - just that every time I've tried it, it works
[00:31:04] <MootPoot> as long as it takes SDXC
[00:31:06] <Berlin36> idunno how would i even use that whole memory
[00:31:21] <MootPoot> a copy of wikipedia minimized and compressed is about 100gb
[00:31:24] <MootPoot> that's a start
[00:31:31] <Berlin36> i use only ~40gb out of 64 on my phone 
[00:31:41] <Berlin36> oh, yeah, pocket wikipedia, why not
[00:31:41] <Bco1981> i'm just scared of, it will see the space. but won't be able to read or write beyond the 512gb
[00:31:45] <MootPoot> 4k60fps video is about 1gb / min
[00:31:48] <MootPoot> something like that
[00:32:10] <Bco1981> but some time in the future i will byt a device that can use it.
[00:32:11] <Berlin36> i wonder how big are youtube  servers
[00:32:19] <MootPoot> Bco1981: if it can see the space that means it can be read = in other words its addressable

[00:32:55] <Bco1981> it can "see" it

[00:33:26] <MootPoot> probably more then that

[00:33:34] <MootPoot> also - the rest of google as well
[00:33:42] <Berlin36> that's just amazing

[06:06:28] <isekaijin> Nice. Sometimes sitting on the floor is more comfortable than sitting on a chair.
[06:06:29] <MootPoot> this KDE plasma UI is terrible
[06:06:40] <isekaijin> Yes, just use a tiling window manager.
[06:06:48] <isekaijin> Using the mouse is for the weak.
[06:07:08] <MootPoot> it feels like whoever made it just wanted to copy the smartphone idea but stable some desktop onto it
[06:07:26] <MootPoot> there is nowhere to get a full title readout of what windows you have, icons only

[06:08:49] <amigojapan> withought basic
[06:09:28] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Visual Basic (6, not .NET) still had the better form designer.
[06:09:59] <amigojapan> I agree isekaijin

[06:10:42] <amigojapan> isekaijin: but I woudl spend most of my time in the unix lab
[06:10:49] <MootPoot> I'll say this much - this UI is worse then windows 10

[06:50:38] <amigojapan> hey Fenderbassist
[06:50:44] <Fenderbassist> guarana + caffeine can be a mood elevator, but it also jacks blood pressure so you want to go light with energy drinks
[06:50:47] <Fenderbassist> hi amigojapan how's things?
[06:50:58] <Satin> it does have negative physical effects on me at times yeah
[06:51:22] <Satin> triggers my ptsd tremors so sometimes my hands get real jittery, and you can see me shaking like an old person's hands sort of
[06:51:29] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: not bad, I am finallly getting my booster shot the day after tomorrow
[06:51:32] <Fenderbassist> I understand
[06:51:39] <Satin> and sometimes it has the opposite effect of "nice", sometimes it just turns into anxiety land and hyperviligance

[06:51:48] <amigojapan> yep Fenderbassist
[06:51:53] <Satin> so it's a roll of dice, but when it does work out, like now, it's a positive effect to get things done for me

[06:53:04] <Satin> wow
[06:53:21] <Fenderbassist> for me, once in a while is good but daily not so good for strong drinks
[06:53:24] <Fenderbassist> tea, I can do daily
[06:53:38] <Fenderbassist> is gentle, has caffeine but doesn't hit hard
[06:53:46] <Satin> my dad was strange in that regard, whenever he was doing his missionary work in india

[07:40:36] <Roey> here is my issue with most of the synthwave music I hear these days, and the reason it all sounds the same to me:  they focus on instruments and rhythm more than melody.  80s had melody.  Most of the SW music I hear doesn't really have a melody, just "feelings" from the background chords, spruced up with a drum beat and different instrument timbres.

[07:42:40] <jessedesu2> I can already tell America is going to be polarized over mask wearing
[07:42:45] <Satin> Roey: i wish i knew music theory, this video sounds advanced haha
[07:42:55] <Satin> jessedesu2: as if  it isn't already
[07:42:55] <Satin> ?
[07:42:56] <Roey> jessedesu2: I'm sayng that melody has apparently lost its priority in new songs these days.  Fuck, think about how all the new pop songs are all the same Pop chord progressions
[07:43:10] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: have you watched the series The Orville?
[07:43:13] <Roey> jessedesu2: one of the things that attracted me to anime music so much was the melody
[07:43:16] <Satin> Roey: I think looking at pop is a bad idea for this. Pop kind of always sucks in many ways
[07:43:20] <jessedesu2> I don't know what a chord progression is
[07:43:20] <Roey> aye
[07:43:34] <Satin> Roey: I would strongly argue there's plenty of "good music" that isn't repeating stupid bullshit
[07:43:40] <jessedesu2> And I've been playing guitar on and off for 22 years
[07:43:48] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: no, never heard of it
[07:43:51] <Satin> Roey: just like with movie production companies, the labels behind pop music want risk-averse releases
[07:43:52] <Satin> to make $
[07:44:00] <Satin> so of course it's the same themes, the same beats, blah blah
[07:44:09] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: if you can find it to watch it, I suspect you'll like it, it's a comedy that is very star trekkish

[07:44:16] <Satin> (not every artist is like this, but a bunch are. the same ring of producers helping the same stars)
[07:44:20] <Roey> yeah they all use the same four chords

[07:44:30] <MootPoot> :3
[07:44:33] <jessedesu2> The metalcore riff sounds the same, it's very melodic but overused
[07:44:34] <Satin> but it also means that judging our era by pop music is also a bad idea, because you forget all the other good music that exists
[07:44:37] <Satin> that isn't mainstream!
[07:44:37] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: ok, I will look for it
[07:44:39] <Roey> when I'm listening to a song and realize it's just another pop song like that, Ilose interest in it
[07:44:46] <Satin> i do too, i don't listen to much pop
[07:44:55] <Satin> pop does have some good artists now and then, but in general it's /////
[07:44:55] <jessedesu2> I listen to soda
[07:45:04] <Satin> and kinda always has been that way
[07:45:15] <Roey> Satin: sure, agree with you 100%.  It just gets more involving for me to find it
[07:45:19] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: tomako now put on a Star trek orchestra
[07:45:22] <Roey> damn this girl sings fine :)
[07:45:23] <Fenderbassist> very nice
[07:45:30] <Satin> Roey: yep, you have to dig unfortunately to find the good stuff. but isn't it like almost every other thing in our lifetime?
[07:45:34] <Satin> quality amongst all the rubbish
[07:45:45] <Satin> mainstream captialized rubbish*
[07:45:50] <Roey> Satin: I /like/ you :) you make so much sense
[07:46:05] <Roey> Satin: so like, I listen to mostly Israeli music these days
[07:46:07] <Satin> lol, I try. Not all my positions are likeable or reasonable. But I do put throught into things like this.
[07:46:08] <Roey> in my car
[07:46:12] <Satin> Roey: interesting
[07:46:41] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: its easy to forget that these songs were once performed by an actual orchestra
[07:46:41] <Roey> Satin: and over there, there are a few more styles of music that I like
[07:46:51] <Satin> I see :o 
[07:47:06] <MootPoot> oh wow
[07:47:10] <MootPoot> there is a new season of south park
[07:47:11] <MootPoot> poggers
[07:47:24] <Satin> Roey: For me personally Spotify has been a huge weird help. Along with some curated playlists from people who feel like they're making sense, + just me shifting through things. 
[07:47:28] <Roey> lol thanks MootPoot  :) <3 weird al
[07:47:40] <Roey> Satin: I do that withyoutube
[07:47:43] <Satin> There's interesting music podcasts (I don't really listen to them but they exist) like burning ambulence and what not if you get deeper.
[07:47:47] <Satin> I see
[07:47:48] <Roey> ooh ok
[07:48:03] <Roey> Satin: I used to hand-pick the songs I like off Youtube and download them with youtube-dl
[07:48:16] <Satin> Did that when I was younger :P
[07:48:18] <Nanobot> Putin has announced that this whole thing was one giant misunderstanding, and he will happily end the military operations in Ukraine if Biden and the EU agree to formally refer to Putin as the greatest leader of all time and give him back his black belt in taekwondo.
[07:48:31] <Roey> Satin: these days I take a list of say..250 most popular israeli music pieces of 2021 or 2020 and download the entire playlist, to listen to in my car
[07:48:39] <Roey> Satin: a lot of it is so forgettable, jeez
[07:48:49] <Roey> Satin: but there are many gems there!
[07:48:54] <Satin> heh, yeah
[07:49:03] <amigojapan> lol Nanobot
[07:49:06] <Roey> Nanobot: lol
[07:49:38] <Satin> I think people in general should also consider trying to get a bit educated in music (this applies to me as well). Some people think that all art that is good should just be "obvious" and easily accessible.
[07:49:43] <Roey> Satin: iwth Spotify, you can download to local, mp3s, right?
[07:49:50] <Fenderbassist> lol I thought his black belt was in judo
[07:49:53] <Roey> Satin: ah
[07:49:56] <Satin> My argument is, for some art, we need to learn a bit in order to appreciate things better sometimes.
[07:50:05] <Fenderbassist> that is funny though
[07:50:10] <Satin> (This is for me too, I would like to understand more music theory slightly or learn a bit more about jazz history)
[07:50:15] <Nanobot> amigojapan: Did you see my question earlier?
[07:50:28] <Roey> Satin: 100% agreed.  And I would extend "appreciate" to mean "develop one's own sense of taste in what music they like"
[07:50:29] <amigojapan> no Nanobot
[07:50:35] <Nanobot> amigojapan: If you post a comment explaining something, and someone replies with "横から失礼します。あくまで参考程度にって事ですね", does that basically just mean, "Saving this comment for later"?
[07:50:37] <Satin> Roey: Spotify can locally download things for use in their client but unfortunately you cannot download it without DRM or whatever.
[07:50:44] <Roey> Satin: there is this youtube podcast I follow about jazz
[07:50:47] <Roey> Charles Cornell
[07:50:52] <Satin> Roey: ooh, looking it up

[07:51:31] <Roey> he's a jazz pianist and goes over a LOT of music theory
[07:51:40] <Satin> Sounds like a great YouTube channel, thank you.
[07:51:47] <Roey> <3
[07:52:21] <Roey> he tackles many aspects of music--melody, beat/rhythm, style, etc.
[07:52:21] <MootPoot> this chair better not be shit
[07:52:29] <Roey> MootPoot: stop farting in it so much?
[07:52:32] <Satin> Regarding Spotify, I personally use it like a music aggregator in a way, and assume that if I really want to, (someday when I set up harddrives and NAS and stuff like that) I can find a place to download full quality version from.
[07:52:38] <amigojapan> Nanobot: it means, excuse me I am comming in from the side, Iamm just taking a sample of it
[07:52:38] <Roey> aye
[07:52:41] <Roey> Satin: aye
[07:52:43] <MootPoot> Roey: I do my best not to shart
[07:53:07] <Satin> but i don't like the decline in owning our music/media. fuck DRM.
[07:53:14] <Roey> riiiight
[07:53:19] <Satin> fuck renting from big corps too. netflix sucks as well.
[07:53:32] <Roey> I haven't had netflix in > 10 years
[07:53:40] <Satin> I haven't either, but all my friends use it
[07:53:42] <Roey> haven't had cable tv, either, in > 10 years
[07:53:46] <MootPoot> fuck the shitty chair corps
[07:53:46] <Satin> yeah
[07:53:59] <Satin> MootPoot: get a giant rock and sit on it
[07:54:02] <Satin> problem solved
[07:54:07] <Roey> but honestly Satin, I don't have the /attention span/ to watch a movie or show by myself
[07:54:11] <Satin> sit in the thinking position like those sculptures
[07:54:17] <Satin> (wear some clothes though)
[07:54:36] <Roey> MootPoot: be like Rodin's The Thinker
[07:54:41] <Satin> Roey: I don't either? And I'm a judgemental prick when it comes to movies.

[07:55:02] <Satin> Most anime/movies simply don't meet my standard, if I'm going to watch something, it needs to be substantial, and most things are simply disappointing.
[07:55:07] <Satin> It sounds pretentious but it's just what it is to me.
[07:55:10] <Roey> right.
[07:55:19] <Roey> there are few animes that I've found that had an impact on me like that
[07:55:22] <Satin> So I rarely watch things. That doesn't mean that i've watched all the good stuff. I have a list.
[07:55:22] <Roey> Spice and Wolf
[07:55:25] <Satin> But yeah.
[07:55:26] <Roey> Mawaru Penguindrum
[07:55:30] <MootPoot> Euphoria
[07:55:39] <MootPoot> Bible black
[07:55:49] <Roey> haven't seen those
[07:55:53] <Nanobot> amigojapan: I'm still not sure what that means. The context is the comment section here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V7nZlfLEzo&lc=Ugzf9fT_uhR0UfajOwJ4AaABAg (it's the first comment, and the 3 replies).
[07:56:03] <Roey> BTW so Mawaru Penguindrum was a suggestion from you guys

[07:56:12] <Satin> At the same time though, I fully recognize that people don't always watch things for intellectual advancement or whatever. They often watch things to relax and be entertained, and escape from all the hustle and bustle of their worlds around them, so they can consume stuff like that.
[07:56:20] <Satin> So to be clear I'm not looking down on that, it's, just, not for me.
[07:56:22] <Roey> hmm, yeah
[07:56:27] <Roey> makes sense
[07:56:32] <MootPoot> become monke
[07:56:54] <Satin> I just take issue when people praise those "cheap" entertainment things as being masterpieces or real art when they aren't.
[07:57:10] <Satin> Like the over-enthusatic anime watchers that call something great when it isn't that well written relatively.
[07:57:15] <Satin> Or those that naively praise marvel movies smh
[07:57:17] <MootPoot> spice and wolf is a masterpiece, how dare you
[07:57:21] <Satin> when there's greater things out there.
[07:57:29] <Roey> oh, so my parents were hosting a Movie Night and they were wondering whether or not to show a movie like The Master (2012) with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix.  It's a movie that makes your brain crunch, and they don't want folks to have to think too hard
[07:57:33] <Satin> that are far more well written and address things about the human condition
[07:57:39] <Satin> yeah
[07:57:48] <Roey> they showed it, some folks kvetched about it afterwards but people were fine with it
[07:57:49] * MootPoot looks at Satin's condiiton
[07:57:50] <Satin> that's a big thing, the brain thinking hard stuff
[07:57:56] <MootPoot> you should get that checked out
[07:57:56] <Nanobot> I thought I watch anime to escape the human condition.
[07:58:06] <Roey> yeah, so that movie basically is about the start of a movement like Scientology
[07:58:22] <Roey> Nanobot: you watch anime to escape the human condition? it'sall about the human condition though
[07:58:27] <Satin> Art does *require* putting effort in. You shouldn't just be sold commodified art for appealing to your sensory pleasures
[07:58:28] <amigojapan> Nanobot: excuse me, I will take that as an example
[07:58:40] <amigojapan> Nanobot: I think that is what they meant
[07:58:47] <Satin> and giving you what's around you, repackaged,  same tropes, same ideas, same everything
[07:58:53] <Roey> right
[07:59:05] <Satin> versus: making you critical more of stuff, introducting new notions, abstractedly exploring things
[07:59:06] <Satin> w/e
[07:59:19] <Roey> Satin: there is this internal thing, this part of my brain, that once it detects a familiar pattern, loses interest
[07:59:24] <Satin> Roey: same
[07:59:31] <Roey> Satin: in music, in art, it's like.. I want somehting nice and novel
[07:59:53] <Satin> Now to be clear, regardless of what I say, I too sometimes watch trash, but I'm aware of it 👀
[07:59:55] <Roey> it's like, oh, I've decoded the song, ok, /next/
[08:00:00] <Roey> Satin: hahah
[08:00:01] <Roey> yeah
[08:00:06] * Satin listens to EDM generic garbage for feel-good sensations in the moment sometimes
[08:00:10] * Satin or pop
[08:00:19] <Roey> Satin: here's a thought... do you know songs that keep evolving without a chorus?
[08:00:22] <MootPoot> According to YUR fit I burned 330 cal today in beat saber 
[08:00:24] <Satin> earworm
[08:00:28] <Satin> Roey: plenty
[08:00:34] <Satin> but they're not mainstream stuff
[08:00:43] <Satin> or at least not that common a pattern
[08:01:18] <Roey> Satin: like which ones?  I found this listicle on songs without choruses; found that they tend to be repetetive: https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/10-amazing-songs-without-choruses-762322

[08:01:25] <Roey> *tend to sound repetitive
[08:01:55] <Roey> Satin: my brain lights up when it's mapping the song out as it listens to it
[08:02:31] <jessedesu2> What is a chorus
[08:02:40] <Roey> the part that repeats
[08:02:49] <Satin> not all choruses are bad to me
[08:02:52] <Roey> sure
[08:02:58] <Satin> but a song in general that's just rigidly the same tropes/structures
[08:03:03] <Roey> aye.
[08:03:03] <Satin> generic 3:50 songs
[08:03:12] <Roey> so Spice and Wolf's opening drew me in
[08:03:17] <jessedesu2> Hyperpop is 2 minutes
[08:03:21] <Roey> probably my favorite anime song ever.
[08:03:25] <Satin> a lot of hip-hop, good stuff if you can listen to it, is nice with breaking that too

[08:10:34] <Roey> reminds me of billie eilish in terms of that depression
[08:10:51] <Roey> btw something about billie eilish that I found out, that instantly made me respect her: she doesn't use drugs. at all.
[08:10:54] <Roey> never has.
[08:11:05] <Satin> billie elish in general seems good though i haven't listened to her
[08:11:09] <Roey> aye
[08:11:12] <Satin> she's part of what some would call "metamodernity" 
[08:11:17] <Roey> what'sthat
[08:11:24] <Satin> gosh. it will be something to explain.

[08:13:10] <Roey> good luck!!!

[08:13:24] <Roey> <- 41
[08:13:36] <Roey> So calc 2... eesh
[08:13:42] <Roey> drill drill drill!!!!
[08:13:56] <Roey> what is the subject for the exam,  specifically?
[08:14:32] <Satin> Give me 5 minutes, brb.
[08:17:27] <Nanobot> Ukraine says they have downed 7000 of Russia's planes. The Kremlin says Ukraine is lying, and that they haven't downed a single one of their 70 billion planes.
[08:18:24] <Nanobot> Meanwhile, Ukraine is definitely going to get 70 more planes from Europe. Surely. Any minute now.
[08:18:38] <Roey> 7000???
[08:18:49] <Nanobot> Those numbers might be inflated a bit
[08:18:56] <Roey> Nanobot: I heard that basically Russia's encircling Ukraine
[08:19:07] <Roey> and they've taken over a few cities in the south
[08:19:19] <Nanobot> They're encircling certain cities in Ukraine.
[08:19:25] <Roey> right
[08:19:26] <Roey> so:
[08:19:41] <Roey> Kharkiv for example.
[08:20:00] <Nanobot> They can't encircle Ukraine. Poland is one of the countries that borders Ukraine, and like every country's military has presence on that border right now to keep the Ruskies away.
[08:21:21] <Roey> think about this rationally: if Russia finds opposition from other countries then it will escalate things to an even bigger degree
[08:21:27] <Roey> *military opposition
[08:21:39] <Roey> that is, what's going to happen? they'll down a Russian jet? 
[08:21:51] <Roey> that'll give Russia pretense to do something /really/ bad.
[08:21:51] <Nanobot> On paper, the situation for Ukraine has been bleak from the beginning. What's helping them right now is that the Russian soldiers really don't want to be there and don't seem to even know why they're there, and Russia is falling apart as a country now.
[08:22:03] <Roey> right.
[08:22:04] <Roey> 100%.
[08:22:14] <Roey> I read that an entire batallion defected or surrendured.
[08:22:39] <Roey> it hurts me to watch thir stuff get blown up, because inside that stuff are 20-year-old kids
[08:23:09] <Roey> I don't watch the news because they ratchet that anxiety up 10x.
[08:23:22] <Roey> last thing I need is to hear updates with war music in the background
[08:25:17] <Nanobot> war music? More like... warm ew sick.
[08:25:26] <Nanobot> I dunno
[08:25:47] <Nanobot> I don't own a TV.
[08:26:30] <Nanobot> I sometimes watch TV when I'm in a hotel on a vacation. There's a channel that's basically just Impractical Jokers all day.
[08:27:07] <Roey> aha
[08:27:08] <Roey> ok
[08:27:11] <Roey> I have a TV but I don't watch it
[08:27:21] <Roey> I've turned it on maybe like once or twice all of last year
[08:27:28] <Roey> it's a nice 55" unit, too.
[08:28:03] <Roey> but again--I don't hve the attention span to go to my living room to sit in front of it and watch.. I'd rather be in front of my computer, where I can go to Firefox at a moment's notice.
[08:31:27] <Satin> hi
[08:33:04] <Roey> hi1!
[08:33:14] <Roey> wb.
[08:33:36] <Satin> The subject for this exam is uh.
[08:34:24] <Satin> 7.3-7.5 and 7.8 and 8.1-8.2
[08:34:43] <Satin> 7.3 - Trignometric substitution
[08:34:55] <Satin> 7.5 - Strategy for Intergration
[08:35:03] <Satin> 7.8 - Improper Intergrals
[08:35:25] <Satin> 8.1 - Arc Length
[08:35:33] <Satin> 8.2 - Area of a Surface of Revolution
[08:38:10] <Satin> I'm not really feeling confident. I worked for 5 weeks straights and kept up with assignments, then had a sort of mental breakdown over last weekend, and then didn't do well on a Physics test I could have, getting 17/40. Irony when you work for most of the semster and keep up, but then collapse under stress the week before the first important test. 
[08:38:11] <Roey> Nanobot: correction, Russians have managed to tkae over the city of Kherson, not Kharkiv. 
[08:38:15] <Roey> Satin: ooh
[08:38:16] <Roey> nice
[08:38:38] <Roey> Satin: ok no emotions, just drill drill drill
[08:38:42] <Roey> do you have material to drill on?
[08:38:46] <Satin> The Ukraine thing was too enticing to follow up
[08:38:56] <Satin> Yeah, and I have to worry about CS assignments that are over-due right now first.
[08:39:01] <Roey> aye
[08:39:02] <Satin> Today isn't a good week for me
[08:39:08] <Satin> it was till this week lol
[08:39:14] <Roey> *hug* next week it'll be better
[08:39:16] <Satin> but that's just how it goes i guess
[08:39:16] <Satin> ty
[08:39:40] <Roey> that's great that you think that way ("that's just how it goes")
[08:39:49] <Roey> like, no one is conspiring against you
[08:39:59] <Satin> Trying! It's a bit hard when you see the negative results flow in.
[08:40:12] <Satin> but rationally, it's all dependent on the process, and there are setbacks.
[08:40:12] <Roey> Oftentimes it can be too easy to fall into thinking that someone has it in against you, and that this is why you're not progressing
[08:40:17] <Satin> yeah lol
[08:40:39] <Satin> The biggest negative stressor in my life right now was the fact that a drunk driver hit me on Feb 6th, Sunday morning, at 1 am.
[08:40:46] *** Quits: RoadKillGrill (~RoadKillG@cpe-71-74-95-248.insight.res.rr.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:40:48] <Roey> FUCK
[08:40:50] <Satin> Hit my parked vehicle I mean, in front of the house, parked on the side of a street.
[08:40:56] <Roey> oh
[08:40:58] <Roey> *phew*
[08:41:13] <Roey> how's your car doing??
[08:41:15] <Satin> I was doing homework at the time and the neighbour knocked to let me know that the "blimp" sound was actually... someone crashing into my vehicle.
[08:41:22] <Roey> !!! :(
[08:41:33] *** Quits: ghab13 (uid460350@id-460350.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[08:41:35] <Roey> did the driver stay there??
[08:41:42] <Satin> Yeah, she didn't try to run or anything.
[08:41:51] <Satin> I think she even got some medical attention shortly
[08:41:59] <Roey> understood
[08:42:05] <Roey> I'm glad that she's safe
[08:42:11] <Roey> and that she didn't drive off
[08:42:21] <Satin> But that *resists using strong language* dumbass, I'm glad she's okay, but she didn't even remotely try to stop.
[08:42:26] <Roey> aye
[08:42:36] <Roey> so that was on the 6th; did you get your car fixed since then?
[08:42:40] <Satin> I bet she passed out for a moment right before it went smack into my car, I think she even had a passenger.
[08:42:43] * MootPoot resists the urge to make a nsfw joke
[08:42:47] <Satin> No. That's the other thing that's pissing me off.
[08:42:51] <Roey> ok
[08:43:06] <MootPoot> shoulda pissed in h-
[08:43:07] <MootPoot> NO
[08:43:10] <MootPoot> bad MootPoot 
[08:43:19] <Roey> pissed in hiding.
[08:43:20] <MootPoot> its too late for NSFW jokes
[08:43:21] <Roey> Surprise pissing.
[08:43:35] <Roey> Remmeber me? You crashed into my car /SURPRISE!!!/ pissssssss
[08:43:42] * MootPoot claps
[08:43:43] <MootPoot> amazing
[08:43:51] <Satin> The police told me the police report related to the incident would be produced within 4-5 business days, from which I could get the other driver's insurance detail (I, being a young driver, have to deal with high insurance rates so I have liability insurance only. I needed her insurance details, because I need to be compensanted and take the next steps towards dealing with my vehicle situation. which was 100% her fault)
[08:43:54] <MootPoot> you've done a better job then I ever could have
[08:44:11] <Satin> Instead, the police kept delaying me. I kept phoning the records department.'
[08:44:13] <Roey> wtf
[08:44:19] <Roey> MootPoot: that's why I'm here <3
[08:44:20] <Satin> "Sorry. It's not available yet."
[08:44:29] <Satin> Then the next week after that "The captain hasn't approved it yet.."
[08:44:30] <Roey> wtf........ugh
[08:44:33] <Roey> WHAT???
[08:44:37] <Satin> And this went on for an entire fucking month. Till last Friday.
[08:44:43] <Roey> ok, and then what happened?
[08:44:58] <Satin> For some time I started to wonder if the drunk driver's family was friends with the local police chief or something.
[08:45:09] <Satin> Or if they were just under-staffed. I don't know.
[08:45:10] <Roey> YEAH that'swhat I was immediately thinking
[08:45:26] <Roey> maybe they're stallign so that insurance could say that you've gone past their window of time to report it
[08:45:30] <Roey> that's what I thought
[08:45:35] <Satin> Anyways, I finally got the police report on Friday (they put my middle name as my last name...fucking incompetence left and right here)
[08:45:40] <Roey> sure
[08:45:45] <Roey> ok and you got her insurance#?

[08:46:03] <Satin> here's the police report description
[08:46:07] <Satin> And yes, I did. Finally.
[08:46:10] <Roey> ^ see that's an example of one of those times where you swear maybe it's  a conspiracy against you
[08:46:18] <Roey> Satin: *phew*, finally...
[08:46:21] <Satin> I called them on Monday. Finally got the car towed on Tuesday
[08:46:25] <Roey> \o/
[08:46:26] <Satin> ... Yesterday I mean.
[08:46:45] <Roey> did the mechanic give you a report of whta's needing to be fixed?
[08:46:50] <Roey> *of what needs fixing
[08:47:07] <Satin> But I'm still car-less. And have been for an entire month. Tomorrow morning I hopefully will get a rental by driving up with housemate 50+ miles to a city nearby and getting a rental.
[08:47:21] <Satin> He hasn't given a report but I called him this morning, and asked him what he honestly thought
[08:47:22] <Roey> ok
[08:47:26] <Satin> he told me he thinks the car is probably total'd
[08:47:30] <Roey> sigh......
[08:47:32] <Satin> because of the suspension carriage
[08:47:35] <Satin> being hit underneath
[08:47:38] <Roey> frame damage?
[08:48:03] <Satin> I don't know. Not really that knowledagable about cars, but suspension is the word i heard from him.
[08:48:07] <ButterNoodle> what a shitty time to be without a car
[08:48:19] <ButterNoodle> I mean have to shop for a car..
[08:48:22] <Satin> It is a shitty time to be without a car. That's partly why I've gotten tested.
[08:48:39] <Satin> I'm not an angry person usually, I genuinely have a hard time being angry for too long.
[08:48:44] <Roey> totally......
[08:48:57] <Satin> But part of my own failings with school, and then the car stress, really are testing my patience recently, smh.
[08:49:01] <Satin> fuck. drunk drivers.
[08:49:03] <Roey> Satin: stay strong...
[08:49:28] * Satin did not realize that car-rides to de-stress were more critical in her life till now
[08:49:33] <Satin> critical than expected*
[08:49:47] <Roey> *bug*
[08:49:49] <Satin> Those random trips into the mountain roads nearby are just something else.
[08:49:50] <Roey> * *hug*
[08:50:03] <Satin> You have the wind in your face. Beautiful New Mexico deserti-ish mountain landscape.
[08:50:17] <Satin> Less light pollution out here. It's the middle of nowhere to many, but it's amazing to me.
[08:50:21] <Roey> yep
[08:50:26] <Satin> First thing when I get a rental is probably going out there LOL
[08:50:39] <Roey> :))))))) 
[08:51:00] <Roey> by then, you'll be able to intemegrate anything
[08:51:09] <Roey> integrate over that chair.  Sure!

[08:58:46] <ButterNoodle> yes
[08:59:06] <MootPoot> Do you cook better then your wife ButterNoodle 
[08:59:13] <Satin> So I've been avoiding going to his lectures. A friend who's at this school told me when he took it, he was drooling the whole time because of how incomphrensible the lecturer was.
[08:59:15] <MootPoot> Ez housewife points 
[08:59:27] <Satin> But. I have not also been doing my due dilegence by aggressively reading the textbook like I should.

[09:01:18] <Satin> you are a lucky person
[09:01:47] <Roey> <ButterNoodle> who wants to be my house boy or girl? <- reminds me of something.  So one of my best friends whom I had known since age 8, third grade, the one who had left his wife and two kids (and now is fighting for joint custody of them in the divorce), and moved to the gayest neighbborhood in Washington DC (logan cicle),  now he's sayng that he has a boyfriend
[09:01:54] <Roey> it's so like.. what the heck.. to me
[09:02:26] <Roey> he identifies as bisexual has the gay pride flag outside his house (outside of DC), etc.
[09:02:45] <Satin> lol
[09:03:02] <Roey> and I found it interesting that he now says that he's finding it more fitting somehow that his next relationship will be with a man
[09:03:11] <Satin> good for him
[09:03:31] <Satin> unfortunate to hear the kids had to go through that
[09:03:40] <Roey> oh the divorce is really bitter.
[09:03:44] <Satin> :c
[09:03:55] <Satin> I swear, more people need to live with each other for a fat while before getting married or something
[09:04:13] <Roey> to the point that I can't talk to her about anything too deep until the divorce is over, lest what she tells me may pass to him.
[09:04:18] <Satin> yeah
[09:04:27] <Roey> (I'm friends with her through him, am very close to her and her family)
[09:04:32] <amigojapan> I got married really quickly and am still married after 20 years
[09:04:33] <Satin> interesting
[09:04:39] <Satin> on the other hand, my parents really should divorce probably
[09:04:42] <Roey> they were together for 15 years now.
[09:04:45] <Satin> aside from my younger siblings and me
[09:04:47] <amigojapan> tho I realize thats not very common
[09:04:53] <Satin> it's entirely toxic and so forced
[09:05:00] <Satin> they keep fighting, and it ruins the kids mentally too
[09:05:02] <Roey> with your prents?
[09:05:05] <Satin> Yeah.
[09:05:08] <Roey> *with your parents? I see.
[09:05:10] <Roey> but you knowwhat
[09:05:10] <Satin> They're crazy  southern baptist evangelicals.
[09:05:20] <Roey> I've also seen cases where the parents stick together
[09:05:23] <Satin> So they're forced to stay together, partly for the 5+ younger siblings I have.
[09:05:25] <Roey> and benefit for it, as a result
[09:05:34] <Roey> Satin: yeah, totally 
[09:05:36] <Satin> But all I can see is just, so much hurt and them ruining themselves
[09:05:53] <Satin> My dad sometimes has physically hit my mom with his pathrarical god given authority bullshit ideas
[09:05:53] <Roey> but at the end they see the kids they raised, and that should make it all worth it
[09:06:06] <Satin> and my mom is a schizo trump supporter in her own way
[09:06:09] <Roey> that's what I tell myself at least
[09:06:11] <Roey> ah
[09:06:14] <Satin> and believes in conspiracy theories
[09:06:20] <Roey> yeah well there are many
[09:06:23] <Satin> it's fked
[09:06:24] <MootPoot> I want to divorce 
[09:06:27] <Satin> evangelicals 
[09:06:30] <Roey> I want to get married
[09:06:35] <Satin> MootPoot: divorse with who? 🤣
[09:06:36] <Roey> Satin: ahh
[09:06:39] <Satin> divorce*
[09:07:03] <Roey> Satin: say....so you probably had lots of experience going to church when you were younger, yeah?
[09:07:07] <Satin> So my mom is both an abusive person and gaslights  and is toxic
[09:07:08] <amigojapan> Roey: do you really want to make more people suffer?
[09:07:18] <Roey> amigojapan: I just want the kids honestly
[09:07:20] <amigojapan> Roey: that is the one thing I regret

[09:07:38] <Satin> the fuck?
[09:07:42] <amigojapan> Roey: I have one
[09:07:44] <Roey> ok

[09:07:52] <Roey> well I want to raise kids with hte iright woman obviously
[09:07:54] <Satin> Have kids. 
[09:07:58] <amigojapan> Satin: all suffering follows kids being born
[09:08:05] <Satin> amigojapan: suffering for who
[09:08:14] <amigojapan> Satin: everyone that suffers
[09:08:14] <Satin> amigojapan: this is the weirdest/craziest thing I've heard from you in a while
[09:08:21] <Roey> ^^^^^^6
[09:08:22] <Roey> yeah
[09:08:28] <Satin> amigojapan: not everyone has experiences like you, no offense. 
[09:08:42] <Satin> I'm sure it has been difficult to raise your son in your circumstances, and you have my sympathy.
[09:08:45] <Roey> amigojapan: you're so level-headed about most everything, so it's jarring for me to hear that from hyou
[09:08:46] <Roey> you*
[09:08:50] <Satin> But you shouldn't generalize that to all people who are planning to have kids.

[09:09:16] <Satin> (and sufficently prepared for the challenges at hand)
[09:09:19] <Roey> is it weird to want kids even more than a wife
[09:09:26] <Satin> Nah.
[09:09:33] <Satin> Not particularly.
[09:09:38] <Roey> i feel like relationship-y stuff is like for people in their 20s
[09:09:39] <amigojapan> Roey: I wanted kids back then
[09:09:41] <Roey> and I'm twice that
[09:09:47] <ButterNoodle> ?
[09:09:51] <Satin> I mean, relationships are an important part 
[09:09:52] <ButterNoodle> I want kids
[09:09:54] <Roey> aye
[09:09:58] <Satin> but I understand that you might want more kids to raise
[09:10:00] <ButterNoodle> because the ones I have are a disappointment
[09:10:01] <Roey> but you have kids ButterNoodle, yeah?
[09:10:04] <Roey> oh.
[09:10:22] <Satin> I don't plan on having kids but I do plan to adopt
[09:10:30] <Satin> if my partner so wishes
[09:10:42] <amigojapan> Satin: adopting is totally a good thing with antinatalists
[09:10:51] <Satin> amigojapan: I don't support antinatalism nonsense
[09:10:58] <Satin> their arguments are circular
[09:11:03] <amigojapan> Satin: we approve of you
[09:11:07] <Satin> existence itself is suffering to them, that's stupid
[09:11:26] <amigojapan> suffering only occurs in the context of existance
[09:11:28] <Satin> I don't approve of antinatalism and I'm hostile to them.
[09:11:35] <Satin> Yeah, and suffering isn't entirely bad.
[09:11:48] <ButterNoodle> I'd like to just keep fuckin till I make a decent kid
[09:11:50] <Satin> Out of suffering comes progress as well.
[09:11:51] <amigojapan> well, I dissagree with that
[09:12:01] <Satin> Then it is a very naive and simple view of suffering in my opinion.
[09:12:17] <amigojapan> we dont need to progress
[09:12:21] <Roey> yall are too interesting for me to have a conversation so late at night
[09:12:23] <Satin> Yes we do.
[09:12:23] <Roey> yallah
[09:12:26] <Roey> i need to get to bed
[09:12:28] <amigojapan> why cant we just be happy?
[09:12:32] <Satin> The human condition involves both happy things, and things like negative emotions.
[09:12:35] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: u hopin for global thermonuclear war?
[09:12:37] <amigojapan> gn Roey
[09:12:38] <Roey> have a good night all, and thanks for this *wonderful* discussion <3
[09:12:39] <Satin> gn 
[09:12:48] <isekaijin> Suffering is good. You can't eat beef if a cow doesn't suffer. You can't have cheap computers if overworked factory workers don't suffer.
[09:12:58] <Roey> wait
[09:13:00] <Roey> the fuck?
[09:13:02] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: no, only cause it would nto eliminate everyone for sure
[09:13:05] <Roey> sure you can eat beef.  Just make it not from a cow.
[09:13:09] <Satin> What even is "happiness" to you? Living in a drug-induced state of happiness forever sounds boring and stupid. So does living in a world where you only experience positive emotions.
[09:13:11] <Roey> make it meat from plants.
[09:13:15] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: it will eventually for sure
[09:13:16] <Satin> The goal to avoid all suffering is ridiculous.
[09:13:19] <ButterNoodle> with lots of suffering
[09:13:23] <Satin> And breeds mental illness.
[09:13:26] <isekaijin> Roey: The point to eating beef is eating beef that tastes good.
[09:13:31] <amigojapan> isekaijin: but it woudl be better if you could
[09:13:37] <amigojapan> isekaijin: the universe is evil
[09:13:44] <Roey> isekaijin: sure, but we can make it without harming the animal if we make it from plants.

[09:14:18] <isekaijin> amigojapan: The universe is what it is. The laws of physics (the only laws that matter!) don't give a fuck.
[09:14:52] <amigojapan> isekaijin: right, and not giving a fuck is just what a parent does when they have kids
[09:14:55] <Satin> “It's not all bad. Heightened self-consciousness, apartness, an inability to join in, physical shame and self-loathing—they are not all bad. Those devils have been my angels. Without them I would never have disappeared into language, literature, the mind, laughter and all the mad intensities that made and unmade me.”

[09:15:00] <isekaijin> amigojapan: what
[09:15:11] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: how to end the universe
[09:15:24] <amigojapan> isekaijin: not caring about the suffering of their kids future
[09:15:36] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: that is beyond us as of yet
[09:15:51] <Satin> I repeat, suffering is not all equal. Taking the naive view of "all suffering is bad" is a very bad stance.
[09:16:08] <Satin> Even things like being truly happy, come out of being able to suffer a bit for that happiness for many.
[09:16:21] <isekaijin> amigojapan: I was initially joking. But, if you're going to be so terrified of pain that you're willing to give up life to avoid it, well, that's your choice, but allow others to have a more posiive outlook on life.

[09:17:29] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[09:17:33] <Satin> amigojapan: don't blame others for your lack of happiness, you're essentially saying "it's my parents fault I'm suffering"
[09:17:43] <Satin> just like the people who say "I hate God for putting me in this world!"
[09:17:47] <amigojapan> yes Satin
[09:17:54] <Satin> That's a very silly view of it.
[09:17:57] <amigojapan> yes Satin
[09:18:09] <amigojapan> Satin: I agree with both those views
[09:18:11] <ButterNoodle> isekaijin: not if they are willing to being other people like me into existance <- bring?
[09:18:21] <amigojapan> Satin: assumming htere is a god
[09:18:24] <Satin> amigojapan: that's just your depression speaking
[09:18:24] <ButterNoodle> blame ur parents
[09:18:25] <isekaijin> ButterNoodle: ?
[09:18:37] <ButterNoodle> isekaijin: that was for amigojapan 
[09:18:47] <amigojapan> bring, right ButterNoodle
[09:18:47] <ButterNoodle> I understand now
[09:18:55] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: seems to me you chose for the most part your life (moving to Japan, getting married, etc.), am not sure what you're unhappy about
[09:19:02] <Satin> amigojapan: You're clearly depressed to some degree, and now are having a dim view of other human beings coming into existence and being able to live complex, complicated lives that include both suffering and positive things.
[09:19:04] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I do blame my parents and our son blames us
[09:19:28] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: anxiety is very painful
[09:19:33] <Fenderbassist> yeah it's not fun
[09:19:38] <Fenderbassist> you work through it
[09:19:59] <Fenderbassist> self help books can be helpful
[09:20:10] <ButterNoodle> hmmm
[09:20:14] <Satin> You would rather blame your surroundings and circumstances for your misfortune rather than being able to own up to the fact that "I am suffering, but it could have gone in other ways. Other people can live happier lives than I can. My parents didn't willfully make me suffer."
[09:20:23] <ButterNoodle> I dont get that
[09:20:33] <ButterNoodle> no one asked to be here..
[09:20:39] <ButterNoodle> its no ones fault
[09:20:50] <amigojapan> Satin: the fact is  that I have acomplished more htings than others have
[09:20:56] * Satin is being unhelpful by this response to a depressed person, but also has strong opposition to antinatalism arguments
[09:20:59] <ButterNoodle> ?
[09:21:03] <Satin> amigojapan: accomplishment alone doesn't mean much
[09:21:16] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I challenge you to a bass guitar battle! :)
[09:21:16] <ButterNoodle> if ur miserable and talking about life not mattering
[09:21:20] <Satin> amigojapan: everyone has their own yardstick by how to judge themselves. Have a healthy one. 
[09:21:29] <ButterNoodle> blaming ur parents for ur existance
[09:21:30] <amigojapan> hehehe Fenderbassist
[09:21:45] <ButterNoodle> and how ur kid blames u?
[09:21:54] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: tell Amigajapan that you and I will do Star Trek theme metal bass solo dueling
[09:22:17] <Satin> I do not approve of the goal of aiming to completely be ""happy"" in every form. I approve of the goal to live a meaningful existence and discovering both what advances you, makes you happy, and allows you to truly live. Including the negative moments.
[09:22:17] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: he says stuff like "if I was not born Iwould not be suffering like this"
[09:22:34] <ButterNoodle> unfortunate..
[09:22:35] <Satin> amigojapan: your son inherited your negative universal worldview on this clearly
[09:22:40] <Fenderbassist> anyways folks, I'm out, have a nice rest of your day/night
[09:22:43] <Satin> gn
[09:22:44] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: thats is a good idea, but i need to learn form scratch

[09:23:01] <Satin> plus your son hasn't lived his life yet himself 
[09:23:04] <Satin> he is incredibly young
[09:23:11] <ButterNoodle> ur wife probably doenst help
[09:23:12] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: nah you just turn your amp up to 11, turn your distortion to full, and beat the thing good rofl

[09:23:43] <Satin> both your body and mental state are changing when you're a teenager
[09:23:52] <Satin> you don't know how to fit in entirely
[09:23:54] <ButterNoodle> Satin: meh.. depends on choices in ur 20s
[09:24:01] <Satin> ButterNoodle: ofc, but genreally speaking
[09:24:34] <Satin> when you're young, both your biology, your social position, and your mental state are working against you in many ways
[09:24:40] <Satin> and importantly: also your lack of fucking experience.
[09:24:46] <amigojapan> at least the suffering in my family may be over with this generation
[09:24:50] <Satin> You don't Know Shit. ™️
[09:25:11] <Satin> Your parents can only convey or demonstrate so many things or ideas for you to adopt
[09:25:21] <Satin> you have to learn to be mature and how the world is yourself, thorugh lived experience, that takes time.
[09:25:41] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:25:41] <Satin> Even things my parents said often didn't register for me entirely till I experienced it myself.
[09:25:55] <Satin> Other things they said, they were wrong about, and i have my own views on it. But other things they were right about.
[09:26:11] <Satin> You have to carve out your own position in this world.
[09:26:19] <Satin> You're not sure of that shit when you're a teenager.
[09:26:22] <ButterNoodle> well many kids can learn to listen to their parents that have lived through shit, rather than their friends that are finding shit out the same as u
[09:26:30] <Satin> yea lol
[09:26:36] <Satin> but it does also take a bit of personal experience too
[09:26:47] <Satin> can't listen to everything mama and papa said not to do
[09:26:56] <Satin> till you learn a bit why there's wisdom to it
[09:27:00] <ButterNoodle> ur better off doing it on ur own rather than taking ur friends advice
[09:27:03] <Satin> (other things they said make sense not to do keke)
[09:27:04] <Satin> yeah
[09:27:08] <Satin> friends/peers can be such a 
[09:27:10] <Satin> mixed thing
[09:27:22] <Satin> on one hand they can lead to strong encouragement and social connections, it's important to be part of a group or whatever
[09:27:28] <Satin> but they can also enable such unhealthy things
[09:27:33] <Satin> peer pressure ...
[09:27:50] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:28:13] <ButterNoodle> boys are the worst tho.. either dick measuring or anti dick measuring
[09:28:20] <Satin> true
[09:28:33] <Satin> men are confusing!!!111111
[09:28:39] * Satin kek
[09:28:49] <ButterNoodle> I'm an open book, but I'm old
[09:29:04] <ButterNoodle> and have learned to just say whats on my mind
[09:29:04] <Satin> Also teenage boys are so fucking weird. Creeps, weird, overreliant and they use me for free therapy
[09:29:09] <Satin> But I also try to understand them
[09:29:09] <ButterNoodle> and do what I want
[09:29:18] <Satin> they too, are struggling with stuff
[09:29:28] <ButterNoodle> *ez study material for psyc/soc
[09:29:29] <Satin> and now america is realizing boys aren't having an easy time either
[09:29:33] <Satin> yea lol
[09:29:46] <Satin> girls have huge issues with self image and what not from media
[09:29:55] <Satin> sexualization from such an early age
[09:30:00] <Satin> and self esteem issues
[09:30:05] <ButterNoodle> having onlyfans as the yardsick and ruler
[09:30:06] <Satin> but boys deal with other shit and loss of identity too these days
[09:30:06] <amigojapan> tomako wants me to say "amigo is saying that but our son has elected his own highschool, and now elected his own tech school, he is creating his own future"
[09:30:10] <Satin> yeah
[09:30:51] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: he will be fine, even with ur negativity :) you will be a proud grandpaw in 10 years
[09:30:54] <Satin> tomako: I'm glad to hear that :) I'm sure your son will also be happier as he finds his place in the world through time. It takes time to discover yourself as a human being, independently from your parents too :)
[09:31:16] <ButterNoodle> *hopefully not sooner
[09:31:22] <Poeticode> epic games bought bandcamp, what the fuck
[09:31:24] <Satin> ButterNoodle: lmao
[09:31:30] <Satin> Poeticode: fucking disgusting
[09:31:32] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: tomako laughed
[09:31:42] <Poeticode> I am puking and crying right now
[09:31:47] <Satin> Poeticode: the one organization i could trust to directly give to artists
[09:31:58] <Satin> is now part of a big corp that most likely will turn it into a monetization machine
[09:32:01] <Satin> what the fuck do we do?
[09:32:03] <Poeticode> yeah and they were gonna waive fees this friday Satin
[09:32:05] <ButterNoodle> I mean his kid us late teens.. idk how it works in japan but in america if u have kids before 25 ur destined for poverty
[09:32:16] <ButterNoodle> so hope for late 20s )
[09:32:16] <Satin> Poeticode: :(
[09:32:18] <ButterNoodle> :)

[09:33:00] <Poeticode> no worries still puking and crying
[09:33:13] <Poeticode> and shitting but that's irrelevant to this

[09:33:31] <Poeticode> jesus those got here quick, quick prayer to bezos
[09:33:35] <Satin> yes XD
[09:33:37] <ButterNoodle> any good?
[09:33:52] <Satin> yeah it's good ofc, i'm not an audiophile but it is known as a very durable one apparently
[09:33:59] <Satin> (i don't like lack of detachable cable but whatever)
[09:34:06] <ButterNoodle> a what a phile?
[09:34:15] <ButterNoodle> hmm
[09:34:20] <ButterNoodle> I think I want detachable cable
[09:34:21] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: phile means love

[09:35:19] <ButterNoodle> :|
[09:35:22] <ButterNoodle> I dontlike that
[09:35:29] <Satin> but it's not too bad
[09:35:36] <Satin> i think that's partly because it's a studio sort of headhpone thing
[09:35:46] <Satin> also came with a free converter for bigger thingies
[09:35:52] <ButterNoodle> uhh
[09:35:53] <ButterNoodle> whats that
[09:35:59] <ButterNoodle> screw type?
[09:36:07] <Satin> you know like the ones that go into pianos
[09:36:08] <Satin> keyboards*
[09:36:11] <Satin> instruments
[09:36:16] <Satin> or like the ones at the end of mics
[09:36:26] <ButterNoodle> :|
[09:36:28] <ButterNoodle> XLR
[09:36:31] <Satin> yea
[09:36:42] <Satin> no not xlr
[09:36:45] <Satin> the other end
[09:37:43] <Poeticode> 3.5mm to 1/4'' plug
[09:38:07] <Satin> yes
[09:38:13] <Satin> 1/4 is the name yes
[09:38:56] <Satin> i also think
[09:38:59] <Satin> that this thing sticking out
[09:39:04] <Satin> makes it less vulnerable to breaking 
[09:39:09] <Satin> like a lot of plugs do with movement?
[09:39:18] <Satin> maybe slightly less breakable idk
[09:39:36] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: finally got my USB C to USB A adapter, will hook up a normal keyboard to tomako's computer, cause it is rejecting bluetooth, I udenrstand why you said "bluetooth gives me blue balls" the other day now
[09:39:59] <amigojapan> tomako's tablet*
[09:40:09] <ButterNoodle> yea its a real pain.. different versions and services offered over it
[09:40:38] <ButterNoodle> yea Satin idk thinking of over ears instead of earbuds for the next set
[09:40:42] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it had no problem connecting the first time, but aafter that it no longer appears in the list of devices
[09:40:53] <Satin> ButterNoodle: my problem is i break headphones always
[09:40:56] <Satin> i swear it's not my fault
[09:41:05] <Satin> but at the same time i'm tired of using earbuds, and they impact my ear wax
[09:41:15] <Satin> i broke my akgs recently
[09:41:21] <Satin> first headphones in years, and it bruke
[09:41:38] <Satin> now i bought $160 Beyerdynamics DT Pro 770
[09:41:44] <Satin> hope it doesn't break, it has a reputation for being durable as heck
[09:42:00] * Satin wishes it could deattach like the akgs but whatever
[09:42:14] <jessedesu2> Poeticode I asked the same question
[09:42:16] <ButterNoodle> damn
[09:42:20] <jessedesu2> About headphones
[09:42:33] <ButterNoodle> every time I measure my heart rate it keeps going up
[09:42:40] <Satin> caffine?
[09:42:43] <jessedesu2> Detachable cable is nicd
[09:42:52] <ButterNoodle> not for 7 hrs
[09:42:54] <Satin> deattachable brains are nice
[09:43:04] <Satin> ButterNoodle: caffine can still affect after 7 rs
[09:43:04] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: beat saber?
[09:43:05] <Satin> hrs
[09:43:05] <jessedesu2> Butter to observe changes the outcome
[09:43:08] <Satin> depending on how much u drnak
[09:43:10] <ButterNoodle> detachable penises are nice too
[09:43:13] <jessedesu2> Quantum mechanics
[09:43:13] <ButterNoodle> ez to wash

[09:43:27] <ButterNoodle> naa just checking my resting heart rate

[09:54:45] <Satin> jessedesu2: make it a rule to only investigate what happened once every 3 days
[09:54:50] <Satin> ill do this to myself if you do it

[09:55:14] <jessedesu2> I am medicated
[09:55:21] <Satin> I'm not
[09:55:29] <jessedesu2> I don't feel compelled to do anything drastic
[09:55:32] <Satin> I'm PTSD stress prone and i deal with it in massively werid ways or just collapse under pressure sometimes

[09:56:37] <jessedesu2> Everyone tells me I need to speak up
[09:56:48] <jessedesu2> I want the world to shut up
[09:56:50] <Satin> speak down
[09:57:11] <jessedesu2> Loud people always get their way
[09:57:25] <jessedesu2> Even if loud and stupid
[09:57:41] <Satin> OUT OF MY WAY
[09:57:50] <jessedesu2> It's just the way the world works
[09:58:09] <jessedesu2> I only lash out after bottling up
[09:58:11] <Satin> it depends
[09:58:20] <jessedesu2> That should be a shirt
[09:58:22] <Satin> there is something to quiet and simplicity too
[09:58:26] <Satin> authenicity and genuinnesfs
[09:58:26] <Satin> s
[09:58:27] <jessedesu2> People will avoid me

[09:58:45] <Satin> urban*
[09:58:48] <Satin> it depends
[09:58:52] <jessedesu2> I hate when people tell me I need to speak up
[09:59:02] <jessedesu2> It's sorta true
[09:59:16] <jessedesu2> I hate how existence works
[09:59:23] <Satin> it doesn't have to be that way
[09:59:27] <Satin> it doesn't have to beee that wayyyyy
[09:59:27] <jessedesu2> That should be a shirt too
[09:59:36] <Satin> you should explore more arttttttttt and not just the visual kind
[09:59:44] <Satin> abstract things, other ways in novels of looking at things, explorations
[09:59:58] <Satin> contrast helps
[10:00:06] <Satin> you experience something else when you're able to comphrend that
[10:00:22] <Satin> it's hard to describe and convince, it's also hard not to sound like an enlightened condescending sometimes even though i'm trying to be honest
[10:00:28] <Satin> but it's true

[12:55:06] <emmeka> that's one thing that I never got into, even during the first big boom of them when I was a teenager. energy drinks.

[12:55:22] <mexen> We had something called Animax when I was 16
[12:55:27] <emmeka> everytime I have tried redbull it's been like this... tastes like floor cleaner?
[12:55:34] <emmeka> why not just drink coffee???
[12:55:46] <DunceCotus> its floor cleaner with a kick

[18:37:14] <teus> but eh, are you against the idea of prostitution?
[18:37:53] <teus> in europe the legal framework is shifting from "questionable" to "legit"

[18:39:01] <teus> over here you can now take a bank loan to buy a house, if youre a sex worker... before you couldnt, because you legally have no real income
[18:39:28] <amigojapan> teus I am just making sure evryone is obeying libera rules, which prevents talking about illegal subjects , which underage prostitusion and prostitusion even if not underage are, especially if they were nto theoretical

[18:51:29] <ButterNoodle> nice
[18:51:35] <HubertFarnsworth> actually one is investment and another for development
[18:51:36] <ButterNoodle> how much $$
[18:51:39] <teus> either people are completely repressed about sexuality, or fanatic about it
[18:51:45] <amigojapan> teus also dont forget I am 44 years old
[18:51:51] <teus> im 35
[18:51:53] <ButterNoodle> I need some beach front property for a hedonist colony in india
[18:52:11] <HubertFarnsworth> overall or just my share?
[18:52:14] <teus> same way in USA people either abstain from alcohol, or go massively drunk every time

But, most people commit copyright infringement regularly without knowing it, and most people are never prosecuted for it. The issue with Nene is she was tracing stuff and passing off the result as her own original art, with wide distribution in things like merchandise.

[19:53:55] <ButterNoodle> japan has a hard on for piracy
[19:54:05] <amigojapan> yup
[19:54:06] * MootPoot pirates some cute girls
[19:54:14] * ButterNoodle puts MootPoot in the slammer
[19:54:30] <Jigsy> I think most countries do.
[19:54:34] <Jigsy> But that's to do with kickbacks.
[19:54:39] <MootPoot> one thing about this whole deal - I mean, you all can pirate stuff all day, but somebody has to cough up the cash to pay to actually make the shit
[19:54:39] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I wonder if htere is any such thing as a pirate party in Japan, if I could vote I owuld vote for it
[19:54:48] <Jigsy> "So, about that thing we discussed..." *putting money into front pocket*
[19:55:00] <MootPoot> I mean, fuck capeshit too, but I'd like them to keep making anime
[19:55:01] <ButterNoodle> put it in my front zipper pocket pls
[19:55:04] <Jigsy> Hell, look at the UK right now and their dirty Russian money news.
[19:55:11] <ButterNoodle> oh?
[19:55:28] <ButterNoodle> russia collusion great brittan flavor?
[19:55:36] <Jigsy> I believe there is a Pirate Party Japan.
[19:55:44] <Jigsy> UK doesn't have one anymore.
[19:55:57] <ButterNoodle> yea the criminal justice system doesnt give a shit about piracy in the US
[19:56:12] <ButterNoodle> u just get sued into perpetual poverty
[19:56:17] <MootPoot> lol up here piracy is basically just a way of life
[19:56:23] <ButterNoodle> here too
[19:56:37] <MootPoot> all the companies are american , and our laws only mandate that they pass on a piracy notice
[19:56:53] <MootPoot> thats it
[19:56:59] <MootPoot> no actual legal action
[19:57:03] <ButterNoodle> yep
[19:57:11] <ButterNoodle> thats why I have VMs in canada

[20:04:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they could just put their stuff on youtube
[20:05:12] <amigojapan> MootPoot: its not a forceful subscription, only the people who want to support do it
[20:05:24] <MootPoot> Jigsy: sure, that works, but what if the ip is still ongoing for more then 5 years? 
[20:05:52] <MootPoot> amigojapan: not all patrons are like that, most are forceful to get additional content 
[20:06:05] <MootPoot> In other words, you have to pay the subscription to get content 
[20:06:11] <Jigsy> Five years is five years. Anything new = five years, anything older = public domain.
[20:06:40] <MootPoot> Jigsy: yah but that's not answering the question 
[20:06:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I dont watch any aditional content form yotubers anyway
[20:06:44] <Jigsy> [16:36:05] <MootPoot> In other words, you have to pay the subscription to get content 
[20:06:59] <Jigsy> I still find it hilarious that people pull the surprised pikachu everytime something is removed from a streaming service.
[20:07:18] <MootPoot> Say a new MMORPG comes out, and it's now it's 6 years later. 
[20:07:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and if they put it on youtubem they would also get ad money
[20:07:37] <Jigsy> I'm getting tired of YouTube ads...
[20:07:44] <MootPoot> How do you handle the copyright of that game 
[20:07:46] <amigojapan> Jigsy: block them
[20:07:54] <amigojapan> Jigsy: ublock origin
[20:08:04] <Jigsy> "With Grammarly..." "Look, I didn't care about Grammarly the first time, I don't care about it the MILLIONTH time..."
[20:08:40] <Jigsy> Aren't MMORPGs subscription based anyway?
[20:09:16] <MootPoot> Some of them, some are f2p, some are expansion based 
[20:09:30] <amigojapan> Jigsy: yeah, youtube needs to have much mroe diverse adventirsing, that is what made me block them to begin with, they kept on giving me the same KFC ad over nd over and over, thta was boring
[20:09:33] <Jigsy> Never really been into MMORPGs, so I can't comment on that.
[20:09:54] <MootPoot> But under your law after 5 years they would lose their copyright for the stuff for the same game they make right now as well
[20:10:01] <amigojapan> Jigsy: why are you still watching youtube ads?
[20:10:10] <Jigsy> amigojapan: They used to be blocked.
[20:10:13] <amigojapan> Jigsy: they are bloackable in every device
[20:10:14] <Jigsy> Then YouTube did... something.

[21:33:52] <lastonestanding> isn't there tin foil also?
[21:34:10] <MootPoot> wax paper isen't very good for actually putting in the oven
[21:34:18] <MootPoot> maybe my temp is too high
[21:34:55] <lastonestanding> how much aluminum do we consume?
[21:35:00] <MootPoot> a lot
[21:35:14] <lastonestanding> can't be healthy
[21:35:27] <lastonestanding> or?
[21:35:30] <MootPoot> I probably piss out at least a few atoms of aluminium
[21:35:32] <MootPoot> every day
[21:35:33] <lastonestanding> iron is good
[21:36:31] <lastonestanding> could it be that so many people are sick nowadays because there is too many metals in our food?
[21:36:58] <MootPoot> its because they eat too fucking much
[21:37:03] <MootPoot> and dont move around
[21:37:16] <MootPoot> there are other side reasons but the above two are the main ones
[21:37:26] <lastonestanding> you talking about america?
[21:37:38] <MootPoot> most of the developed countries
[21:37:45] <MootPoot> US, canada, EU, etc
[21:37:49] <lastonestanding> excluding japan
[21:38:01] <MootPoot> hence why I said most
[21:38:15] <lastonestanding> but EU has many countries
[21:38:46] <lastonestanding> I don't think that they all problems with fat peoples
[21:38:53] <lastonestanding> have problems
[21:39:03] <MootPoot> A lot of the EU does - especially the richer places
[21:39:21] <MootPoot> I think in the US maybe 60% of people are overweight
[21:39:25] <MootPoot> UK is like 40%
[21:39:29] <MootPoot> someething like that
[21:39:30] <lastonestanding> you joking?
[21:39:35] <MootPoot> no
[21:39:39] <lastonestanding> that's way too much
[21:39:45] <MootPoot> I wish I was joking
[21:40:14] <lastonestanding> you don't see that many fat people in movies or live streams
[21:40:31] <lastonestanding> are they hiding?
[21:40:32] <MootPoot> yeah, because they only pick nice looking people for those things
[21:40:33] <MootPoot> lol
[21:40:38] <lastonestanding> well, not moving I guess
[21:44:33] <lastonestanding> Fenderbassist: is a cello a big bass?

[21:45:54] <ButterNoodle> whats that
[21:46:08] <Fenderbassist> no, it's a string instrument smaller than an upright bass
[21:46:11] <Roey> he likes big bass and he cannot lie
[21:46:14] <Fenderbassist> tuned differently too
[21:46:15] <ButterNoodle> I dont have an ircv4 capable client

[23:36:28] <Nanobot> In an effort to strengthen the ruble, Russia has announced that all non-oligarchs must destroy 90% of their money, which will increase the value of the money that remains. Anyone who refuses or is unable to access their money due to the 4-week-long ATM lines will be conscripted and sent to Ukraine.
[23:37:01] <MootPoot> ATM goes brr

[23:40:55] <Nanobot> I have discovered an algorithm from which all fundamental physical constants can be derived.
[23:41:14] <Nanobot> Step 1: Go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physical_constants . Step 2: Hit refresh once in a while, in case new ones show up.

[23:42:25] <Nanobot> I've tried more expensive chairs. For my particular back and my back issues, this chair is definitely the best I've used. I've bought it a couple of times.
[23:42:55] <MootPoot> do you use the arm rests?
[23:43:06] <Bco1981> a couple of times???
[23:43:24] <Nanobot> MootPoot: I put this over the arm rests: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M8F9IYC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

[23:43:57] <Nanobot> I also replaced the gas lift with one whose *minimum height* is exactly what I want the height to be. Because I'm tired of gas lifts breaking.
[23:45:25] <MootPoot> I stopped used arm rests- they put pressure on my elbow nerves
[23:45:28] <MootPoot> then I end up having bad posture
[23:46:25] <Nanobot> I need to minimize the pressure on my back. Arm rests help.

[23:47:00] <MootPoot> I wonder if you could like just cut out the back mesh
[23:47:09] <MootPoot> so it only supports you from around the back

[23:47:24] <Nanobot> That would be worse for me. I need the pressure distributed.
[23:47:36] <MootPoot> ah
[23:47:44] <MootPoot> I thought you needed minimal back contact
[23:48:08] <Nanobot> MootPoot: In fact, the second time I bought this chair, the mesh was too loose and didn't distribute the pressure well enough, so I actually went back and used the back of the older chair again.
[23:48:32] <Nanobot> I was in serious pain until I did that.
[23:49:25] <MootPoot> Tbh with your kind of money - would getting a completely custom chair made be out of the question 
[23:49:35] <MootPoot> Get your physiotherapist to deal with it

[23:57:31] <Nanobot> I get bulging discs. Specifically, my L5/S1 disc was bulging for about 6 years before I got surgery on it (it's still an issue, but no longer manifests as sciatica), and I've also had two other discs bulge at times.

[23:57:44] <teus> you can add armrests to it
[23:57:56] <Nanobot> Up until I got this chair, every chair I owned put painful pressure on at least one of my discs.
[23:58:57] <Nanobot> I've tried chairs that were supposed to be more ergonomic than the one I'm now using, but they still caused issues. I think I just needed the right chair for my back. The one I have now works great.
[23:58:58] <teus> ah
[23:59:18] <teus> so a chair without lumbar support at all?
[23:59:49] <Nanobot> It has lumbar support, but not too much of it. And it has a mesh back with just the right amount of resistance, and just the right curve.
