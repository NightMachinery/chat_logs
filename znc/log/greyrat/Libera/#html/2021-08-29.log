[00:20:10] <bin> maybe i'm misunderstanding what youre saying
[00:20:40] <bin> why don't you want to nest them? i thought you were saying you didn't think you could, so that was my misunderstanding
[00:20:49] <bin> im about to get up to do stuff in a few mins 
[00:30:55] <lantech19446> I probably missed you by now I just saw this, I have no problem with nesting them i'm being yelled at by my validator that nesting them is wrong
[00:43:55] <bin> im still here. what error does the validator say
[00:44:12] <bin> oh lantech19446 it's wrong because you dont have the <ol> inside of an <li>
[00:44:14] <bin> thats why
[00:44:29] <bin> er ul**
[00:44:41] <bin> you cant have ul as a direct child of ol 
[00:46:30] <lantech19446> I'm not sure how to get the ol inside of an li I don't have any list items preceeding the ol
[00:46:52] <lantech19446> but yes that is the validators complaint

[01:14:23] <bin> lantech19446: so like under the second one where it says Promote systemic and institutional transformation in key areas including:
[01:14:28] <bin> put the ul inside of that li
[01:15:19] <bin> <li>Promote systemic and institutional transformation in key areas including:<ul>
[01:15:22] <bin> like that
[01:15:47] <lantech19446> and it won't get messed up by not closing the <li> tag?
[01:15:55] <bin> you will close the li at the end
[01:16:00] <lantech19446> ok
[01:16:19] <bin> <li> blah blah <ul><li>foo</li></ul></li>
[01:16:48] <bin> it's not like <p> where it will try to self-close if there's another <p> nested

[01:21:38] <lantech19446> that did the trick, validator is happy now, thank you
[01:23:38] <lantech19446> I've also just been enlightened as to the fact that modern websites tend to center themselves on the page as opposed to spanning the entire page so I fixed mine to do that now too
[01:39:07] <bin> looks good, although full width is very popular now too, especially with good imagery
[01:40:54] <lantech19446> i thought it would solve my mobile issue too but it didn't so i'm not sure which direction to go

[14:05:42] <acagastya> Hi, for `<video controls>` is it possible to only grant the ability to play/pause the video, hiding other controls be default?
[14:33:12] <Karatsuba> I think it is not possible
[14:50:42] <acagastya> At least not without JavaScript, I am guessing.

[14:51:19] <acagastya> Well, in that case, I have no option but to leave it as it is -- should be a reasonabe compromise.  Thanks Karatsuba.
