[11:51:22] <gerikson> part of it yes
[11:51:31] <gerikson> 'af' is a "noble" infix

[11:55:29] <wink> this is magic
[11:55:29] <af> Clearly arbitrary naming gives too much freedom to people, the government should step in for national security and prohibit this madness. Let everyone be known by an immutable GUID assigned to them at their birth.

[11:55:56] <gerikson> they're not immutable tho

[13:37:48] <mTvare[m]> was v8 not started by google 🤔

[13:39:42] <albertito> llvm was started in a university. Apple later hired folks to work on it
[13:40:51] <iDrougge> True, but as David Chisnail noted, it would probably not have become the LLVM we know without Apple, and Clang would not have come about.

[17:02:15] <gwozniak> I suspect that most people who work where I do don't use Linux on the desktop because they don't want not, not because they aren't allowed (they can use it if they want)
[17:02:54] <gwozniak> Nearly all the devs I work with use Linux in a VM for development
[17:04:30] <Ticho_> depends on the company - larger corpos tend to dictate the exact OS image to use, and it's usually Windows-based
[17:05:48] <Ticho_> often it can be worked around by just installing that image in a VM, and running linux on the bare metal, but again, this depends on how thorough the checks are on the inevitable spyware/bloatware that comes with the image
[17:05:52] <wink> depends on country and company
[17:06:16] <wink> at my last job Windows was disallowed for devs. just because only problems and we were building unix server software
[17:06:35] <wink> but you could choose linux or mac. and I've seen that often, but more likely "discourage windows"
[17:06:56] <wink> but I guess with certain ecosystems (esp. java), windows is actually fine
[17:07:24] <wink> been so many years since I did webdev, but it was janky on windows as well, so we had everything in VMs

[17:07:56] <Ticho_> well, I'm working for a large multinational corp, and they do not really care whether you are a secretary or a software developer, it is One Image To Rule Them All :)
[17:08:40] <Ticho_> luckily, they do not seem to enforce it 100% - at least not yet - and it is possible to get creative and work around it
[17:09:28] <wink> well if you can work it comes down to "I don't like it"
[17:09:44] <Ticho_> I should also say that the corporation also provides the laptops, so they are somewhat justified in dictating the image running on those
[17:09:50] <wink> but if you do C++ for linux (doesn'teven compile on windows) and you slow down everything by working in a VM.. that's bad
[17:10:06] <wink> some people don't care, I would get mad
[17:10:22] <wink> but then again I don't think I'm fit to work for a multinational corp anyway

[17:10:47] <Ticho_> yes, it certainly is different from working in a smaller company :)
[17:11:28] <wink> but I think it does depend. even in the big companies (not HUGE, just big) I've seen people get macs without problems
[17:11:41] <wink> and while I have no love for macs.. at least it's not windows-broken as a dev

[23:00:33] <ignaloidas> imode, NFT's technically don't need to be images, so you just put the whole chain into a file (it's several TB though, have fun with that), and sign that
[23:02:05] <companion_cube> just make NFTs out of lobste.rs' moderation log
[23:02:11] <companion_cube> and get rich
[23:10:06] <ignaloidas> hmm, aparently ethereum chain size wasn't over 1TB until a while ago, makes for a fun pull request https://github.com/ethhub-io/ethhub/pull/535

[23:12:20] <ignaloidas> fun fact, ethereum chan size roughly doubles year to year from my quick analysis
