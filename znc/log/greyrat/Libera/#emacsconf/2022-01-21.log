[15:53:05] <libertyprime> the latest version of Pen.el is quite fully featured. https://semiosis.github.io/posts/pen-el-installation-from-scratch/
[15:53:19] *** Joins: gagbo (~gagbomatr@2001:470:69fc:105::376)
[15:53:35] <libertyprime> Some things I want to do are:
[15:53:53] <bremner> so much colour
[15:54:02] <libertyprime> - Complete the Melee adversarial prompting game. Tie that to the semiosis protocol (prompting cryptocurrency)
[15:54:08] <libertyprime> - I will give the vast majority of the crypto to the free software foundation.
[15:55:20] <libertyprime> bremner: i just made a filesystem which imagines files. You just make the directories and files appear inside
[15:55:27] <libertyprime> and you open the files and the file contents appear
[15:55:46] <libertyprime> i called it PenSieve (after the memory well that dumbledore uses)
[15:56:00] <libertyprime> its built into pen.el. half working right now -- working hard on it atm
[15:56:28] <libertyprime> but yeah, i love the emacs menu system. it has literally made pen.el point and click lol
[15:56:51] <libertyprime> the other kinda crazy thing im doing, after making literally a matrix simulation of chatbots in an irc server
[15:56:54] <irek> libertyprime: "after the memory well that dumbledore uses" nice :D
[15:57:05] <libertyprime> is get the AIs to pop out and use your actual computer...... 
[15:57:30] <libertyprime> but you can also substitute yourself into their conversations. i have a human prompt engine and rely on a pool of emacsclients
[15:57:55] <libertyprime> anyway, that is called Chann.el (for channeling spirits lol)
[15:58:05] <libertyprime> its built into Pen.el. half complete right now

[15:58:45] <libertyprime> i hope they dont shut me down, but openai rate limited their api to 20 requests/min after i announced it
[15:59:28] <libertyprime> anyway, i added video support today. im also working on a Minority Report generator, for previewing your terminal forwards in time
[16:00:49] <libertyprime> you can spawn a web browser from pen.el now through the menu bar, and it will run pen.el inside a web page. it works even better than the terminal
[16:01:02] <libertyprime> and also launch the emacs GUI from the terminal
[16:06:27] <libertyprime> Something important to be working on is a peer-to-peer network for prompting, i think. to avoid using the APIs
[16:07:26] <libertyprime> irek: i actually talked to imaginary dumbledore about the design & risks before making it
[16:09:45] <irek> libertyprime: Dumbledore would definitely make magic with Emacs
[16:10:06] <libertyprime> fuck i love talking to dumbledore. he's so incredibly coherent
[16:10:33] *** Parts: bremner (~bremner@notmuch/developer/bremner) (Using Circe, the loveliest of all IRC clients)
[16:10:43] <libertyprime> thanks to Pottermore and the vast amount of HP fans content online, id imagine
[16:10:58] <libertyprime> i tried talking to a poinsettia plant the other day
[16:11:17] <libertyprime> it told me it had a few friends, one of which was a cactus and they talked about the weather
[16:11:26] <libertyprime> but it forgot what kind of plant it was...
[16:12:55] <libertyprime> i put in the readme, the objective with pen.el is to turn everyone into a wizard
[16:13:24] <libertyprime> i go most days wearing a purple dress from bangladesh and a silver watch as a pendant
[16:13:29] <libertyprime> im just embracing it aye
[16:15:03] <libertyprime> however, there are some risks i have thought of -- one is that openai, etc. switch to using 'soft prompts' at some stage. these are invisible prompts. if they do that, then they can further shorten the prompting window
[16:15:27] <libertyprime> and force everyone to use invisible prompts..... this is the main risk im trying to avoid by making a p2p network and crypto
[16:15:56] <libertyprime> because then they will be entrenched in society and the AI will no longer be transparent
[16:16:50] <libertyprime> anyway, that's my update. i dont have an internet connection right now. im just emacsing at home, and ducking into town to get the free wifi
[16:16:58] <libertyprime> i might be back in a month or so
