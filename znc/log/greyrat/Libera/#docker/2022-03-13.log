[00:01:33] <Tach> is there or is there not a difference between docker image or docker images ?

[00:04:49] <Tach> yes
[00:07:12] <DoofusCanadensis> `docker image` is for managing a specific image. `docker images` is for dealing with all images as a group
[00:08:28] <Tach> it's strange with pruning to be hones
[00:08:31] <Tach> honest
[00:09:42] <DoofusCanadensis> oh I see... 
[00:10:10] <DoofusCanadensis> `docker image` was introduced in 1.25 so it's a refactor of the naming
[00:10:29] <tabakhase> `docker images` == `docker image ls`
[00:10:49] <DoofusCanadensis> like `docker container` provides much of the functionality of original `docker` commands focust on container management
[00:12:54] <Tach> so, images will be deprecated soon (I hope) ?
[00:13:21] <DoofusCanadensis> well it is a nice shortcut as tabakhase pointed out

[03:59:52] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah. I use Artifactory for work (because I'm already using Artifactory for other artifact caching)
[04:00:31] <tabakhase> "pull through cache" is nt general mirroring - its configured purely on the docker-daemon level and then happens invisible to the user
[04:02:31] <tabakhase> "mirroring" images you need ot your own registry is certainly also a viable path - and there is some fairy neat 3rd party tooling for the retagging&pushing ithout needing to unpack the image first and such so it can be build as CI pipelines/automated jobs

[05:01:16] <humanBird> when i run docker compose up on this: https://bpa.st/2TDQ  i'm not sure what images are supposed to be built.  I think it builds an image on local, but not sure what the name of this image is.
[05:01:58] <humanBird> also not sure waht the ports: -1337:80 line is doing
[05:05:00] <BtbN> publishes port 80 on hosts port 1337
[05:05:18] <BtbN> And it appears to be building two images, one for nginx, and one for web
[05:05:40] <BtbN> The names of the images it builds are irrelevant, but will probably be derived from the name of the service in the compose file
[05:08:25] <humanBird> apparently it uses the name of the folder that the docker-compose yaml file lives in
[05:08:49] <humanBird> in this case it said it built an image a few seconds ago with the name (repository?) django-on-docker_web
[05:08:57] <humanBird> it also built a django-on-docker_nginx
[05:10:05] <humanBird> This is all on local i'm assuming.  If wanted to use this in a deployment for kubernetes, what would the image: look like?   image: django-on-docker_nginx?   i'm not sure what should be there
[05:11:04] <BtbN> I don't think you can just "deploy a compose file on kubernetes" like that
[05:11:08] <BtbN> that doesn't really translate
[05:14:56] <humanBird> i'm trying to deploy the image that got built
[05:15:09] <humanBird> i'm not trying to deploy a docker-compose.yml file.
[05:16:08] <humanBird> the images were built and the repository name is "<name of folder enclosing docker compose yaml file>_nginx"
[05:16:32] <humanBird> do i just copy the Image ID hash and put it into the deployment.yml for the image:  yaml element?
[05:17:45] <humanBird> the value i'm replacing there is nginx:latest  so I know it has to be some sort of an image that was built via docker somehow.
[05:18:58] <humanBird> i get a ErrImageNeverPull when i apply a deployment with the hash name.
[05:22:16] <BtbN> That's not how that works though. The compose file contains all the info on how to run the images into a working service. If you just start the bare image somewhere, it won't be very useful and have no config.
[05:22:36] <BtbN> You will need to write the equivalent kubernetes config to your compose file
[05:24:15] <humanBird> i have a deployment yaml and a service.yaml    does the deployment.yaml not use the image built by docker compose?
[05:25:07] <humanBird> right now the pods are erroring on trying to pull the image from docker.io/library/<hash of the built image>
[05:25:34] <humanBird> says i need authorization.
[05:25:57] <humanBird> Is there a way to make kubernetes use my locally built image?

[05:27:23] <BtbN> I have no clue about how kubernetes works. But I know that that's not how this works.
[05:27:56] <BtbN> Google spits out a bunch of official looking guides for auto-converting compose files into kubernetes yaml stuff
[05:29:28] <humanBird> image: nginx:latest is expecting a nginx image from docker hub/wherever correct?  wouldn't the logic dictate that image:  <whatever image> is expecting an image of some sort?
[05:29:56] <humanBird> i'm not trying to convert a docker compose file into a kubernetes yaml file.  i already have built an image and it lives locally.  i want the image: <my local image> thing to work
[05:30:49] <humanBird> the kubernetes deployment.yaml file works with nginx:latest it just doesn't work with whatever my image is.  and it appears the problem is that kubernetes is going to the internet to look for images but not my local computer.

[05:35:59] <humanBird> this is quite backwards though.  you start with a local repository and THEN you go to "cloud git for docker images" .  Why start with "cloud git for docker images" when you're just one person on a local machine...
[05:37:02] <humanBird> It's like telling someone who is learning a technology that they need to start with scaling and performance and distributed systems first before even learning the basics.

[05:38:09] <BtbN> what?
[05:38:17] <humanBird> the problem really is with docker though.  it's literally a docker configuration issue telling it to never look on local for images when you need an image.
[05:38:36] <BtbN> Well, your compose file is set up to build its own images
[05:38:44] <BtbN> which is very sensible and works just fine with... docker

[15:59:08] <ikke> ?
[15:59:11] <ikke> what does docker ps -a return?

[16:01:53] <sky000> oh, can you please tell me how to do it?
[16:02:11] <sky000> in this case i just pulled he image from the docker hub

[16:05:55] <sky000> i am getting a tutorial on docker hopefully i will learn compose soon
[16:06:06] <sky000> is it the preferred way?
[16:06:22] <ikke> compose makes things easier
[16:06:49] <ikke> If you need to recreate / update the container, you do not need to remember what options you passed to docker run
[16:07:21] <ikke> If a container requires extra services, like a database or reverse proxy, it can all be declared in the docker-compose.yml file

[16:13:37] <ikke>  - "/path/to/your/music/folder:/music:ro"
[16:13:38] <sky000> the file name should be the same for different apps? docker-compose.yml? is it ok?
[16:13:45] <ikke> yes
[16:13:52] <ikke> The directory is the project name
[16:14:48] <sky000> i can change the contents of compose file later, right?
[16:14:58] <ikke> yes
[16:15:03] <sky000> oh cool
[16:15:17] <ikke> but it makes sense to change that specific option right awayt
[16:15:29] <ikke> docker would outherwise create that directory if it does not exist

[16:39:40] <dag> docker newbie reporting in
[16:40:20] <dag> i want a container which i can run bash in and experiment and play around with a linux distro. how do I proceed?
[16:40:54] <dag> e.g. there is some software in npm i want to run but dont want to run it on my host machine. 
[16:41:35] <dag> i think i want a vm but docker seems to fit my goal aswell
[16:42:20] <ikke> do you have docker already running? On what kind of host? 
[16:42:29] <dag> yep. im on debian
[16:47:08] <ikke> Easiest is something like docker run -it <baseimg> /bin/bash 
[16:49:42] <dag> alright and that creates a new container each invocation? i want to keep some state e.g. apt install curl or npm install foobar
[16:50:55] <dag> and maybe ill tweak some files in /etc that i want to keep
[16:51:09] <tabakhase> dag once you used bash to experiment, whack your line in a Dockerfile - there is no way around em ;-)
[16:51:31] <tabakhase> and neither curl nor npm should need "you" to build a image -- the hub is your apt-get replacement for now...
[16:52:56] <mavhq> if you're just experimenting, can you mount a persistant volume as / ?
[16:52:57] <dag> basically i want a lightweight vm
[16:53:51] <tabakhase> then youre in thre wrong place - docker is opinionated to NOT be this very strongly --- the "vm-analog" would more likely be LXC ;-)

[20:39:22] <hosk> tabakhase: that's helpful, and makes sense--i was thinking i'm approaching swarm territory which is, to others points, probably more complicated than i need
[20:39:59] <hosk> i'm just trying to rproxy to a vaultwarden container, so i should just put both on the same host
[20:41:26] <hosk> one host already has those ports exposed and i don't feel like bringing everything down, the other one is connected to a vpn which makes networking slightly more awkward, and the third one runs all my dns/pihole/networking stuff so i leave a lot of extra capacity there

[22:06:37] <marcmance> I can find docker-ce package when my arch = amdhf, but not when its amd64
[22:06:53] <marcmance> in the apt sources
[22:07:39] <marcmance> deb [arch=armhf] https://download.docker.com/linux/raspbian bullseye stable
[22:08:37] <DoofusCanadensis> huh... I don't actually have docker configured right now
[22:09:30] <DoofusCanadensis> you meant armhf and arm64, right?
[22:09:41] <marcmance> yes
[22:10:00] <marcmance> crap, I now have to check I didnt typo that
[22:10:32] <marcmance> nope .. I didn't

[22:12:50] <DoofusCanadensis> let's see what the convenience script does

[22:14:53] <DoofusCanadensis> that's what it wants to use on my system
[22:15:13] <marcmance> debian not raspbian
[22:15:18] <marcmance> thanks man
[22:15:30] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, the OS name has changed
[22:15:55] <DoofusCanadensis> "Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) is our official supported operating system."
[22:17:21] <marcmance> Debian just started releasing some unofficial pi images recently too.
[22:18:06] <DoofusCanadensis> in any case, hope that works out... I was reading the Raspbian docs at docker.com to get all that
[22:18:29] <DoofusCanadensis> but yes, internally, the OS identifies as Debian now

[22:32:22] <rockworld> hello everyone, Im pretty new into docker and would like to run a java file called geyserconnect.jar for minecraft with it but when I type the command I get an error -----> therocker@fivem:~/data/GeyserConnect/docker$ sudo docker run --name "geyser-c" -d --restart always -p 19132:19132/udp -v $(pwd)/data:/gsc geyser-connect
[22:32:22] <rockworld> Unable to find image 'geyser-connect:latest' locally
[22:32:22] <rockworld> docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for geyser-connect, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied.
[22:35:51] <rawtaz> rockworld: there is no docker image named geyser-connect at hub.docker.com, so youll have to figure out where to get that image from and then pull it from there
[22:36:49] <njka> sup rawtaz homie
[22:38:16] <rawtaz> lo
[22:38:21] <rawtaz> eating
[22:38:25] <rawtaz> should start working
[22:39:29] <rockworld> rawtaz: this is what im trying to run https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserConnect/tree/master/docker    if someone give me a hit on this 
[22:40:48] <rockworld> this script let players connect to our minecraft server from console to pc server, I was using a public dns but it doesnt work great like if I host my own one
[22:40:50] <akik> rockworld: once you build the image you can start a container with it
[22:42:02] <rockworld> so I need to run "docker build -t geyser-connect" 
[22:42:08] <rockworld> but im not sure in which folder 
[22:42:13] <akik> rockworld: yes remember the dot at the end
[22:42:46] <akik> rockworld: run it in the directory where you have the Dockerfile
[22:43:02] <rockworld> so I need to add a dot at the end ?
[22:43:11] <rockworld> like docker build -t geyser-connect .
[22:43:19] <akik> rockworld: yes
[22:43:34] <rockworld> rightt their tutorial was missing that part I guess
[22:44:43] <rockworld> so I got a permission denied

[22:45:24] <akik> rockworld: run it with sudo or add your user to docker group
[22:45:36] <rockworld> I did adduser therocker docker
[22:45:43] <rockworld> Im gonna try with sudo
[22:46:07] <DoofusCanadensis> did you log back in after adding your user to that group?
[22:46:17] <rawtaz> i think you need to restart your shell or session for the new group membership to take effect. try opening another shell

[22:55:00] <rawtaz> haha
[22:55:01] <rawtaz> sucks :D
[22:55:06] <rockworld> so do I need to run "docker run --name "geyser-c" -d --restart always -p 19132:19132/udp -v $(pwd)/data:/gsc geyser-connect"    on each reboot ?
[22:55:39] <rockworld> yea but I learned something :p
[22:55:58] <marcmance> I can get docker-ce to install now, but not start - https://pastebin.com/4PEBsQK5
[22:56:03] <rawtaz> try a reboot, you might find that since you restart always it will start up automatically
[22:56:30] <rockworld> yes, best way to see ^^
[22:57:38] <marcmance> journalctl - https://pastebin.com/4bfuKMny
[22:59:15] <rockworld> looks like it boot on startup 
[23:01:24] <rawtaz> due to this: --restart always
[23:01:37] <rawtaz> rockworld: does the fact that you asked this mean that you dont understand the command you are runing? thats very bad.
[23:01:48] <rawtaz> you shouldnt run commands or use arguments you dont understand.
