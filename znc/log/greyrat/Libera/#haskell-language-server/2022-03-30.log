[00:58:02] <fendor[m]> awesome, you fixed the tests!
[01:00:45] <boxscape_> hm I did some development on the ghc codebase without HLS because it didn't work for some reason (might be because I was using the wrong ghc configure command), but it works again now, and wow, it's so nice to have it back
[01:00:48] <boxscape_> the only thing I still had to use hackage docs for was finding instances of open type families
[01:00:51] <boxscape_> but maerwald said enough with the feature requests, so I'll pretend I didn't say that
[01:01:24] * maerwald raises fist
[01:02:01] <maerwald> by the time we finally do the release, we'll have reinvented the entire Haskell language
[01:02:24] <boxscape_> sounds somewhat Sisyphean
[01:02:55] <boxscape_> if you then have to do more development to fully support the reinvented language
[01:03:45] <maerwald> everything in Haskell is Sisyphean :D
[01:04:04] <boxscape_> fair enough :D
[01:17:56] <fendor[m]> boxscape_, feature requests to HLS are fine and welcome, we just have enough feature requests for the vscode plugin now, which is going to have new features in the next release
[01:18:15] <boxscape_> I see
[02:20:52] <sm> boxscape_: there's the Haskell Spotlight extension for hoogle searches
[02:21:50] <boxscape_> sm: True, I have it installed even, but I keep forgetting to use it
[02:22:10] <sm> it's not quite as integrated as one would like

[15:50:23] <wz1000> sooch_: I think you were trying to get HLS to build with HEAD. do you have a branch with your progress somewhere?
[15:58:48] <drsooch[m]> I can create one later today, but most of the changes are in head.hackage now. I ended up sinking a lot of time into GHC-exactprint trying to match functionality rather than just compile
[16:03:15] <drsooch[m]> Havenâ€™t had a chance to work on it in a couple weeks but I think after exactprint, it might be hie-bios up next
[16:04:56] <wz1000> ah great, I would like to pick up where you left off
[16:09:24] <drsooch[m]> My day just started so I wonâ€™t get a chance until this evening but Iâ€™ll ping you when I get a branch up
[16:10:23] <drsooch[m]> The progress is underwhelming just FYI lol

[22:45:28] <fendor[m]>  Not yet, I am currently reviewing the UX 
[22:46:01] <maerwald> UX? what's that :D
[22:50:47] <fendor[m]> Yeah, we are going to have another discussion about that :D
[22:51:07] <maerwald> with whom?
[22:51:13] <fendor[m]> But not right now, enjoying my evening right now 
[22:52:07] <maerwald> if we have another discussion, I'm going to force push the implementation into oblivion, lol

[22:55:13] <fendor[m]> Haha. Not sure yet, but these are definitely too many popups for new users. I think we can reduce the amount and make everyone happy! 
[22:55:28] <maerwald> THAT'S WHAT I SAID
[22:55:33] <maerwald> but they wanted more popups!
[23:05:42] <fendor[m]> I know, and I agreed! I think two can work, but I am definitely vetoing more. However, I believe we can reach a good middle ground
