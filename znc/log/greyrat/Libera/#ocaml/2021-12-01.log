[00:04:29] <Anarchos> opam says dynlink                       (version: [distributed with Ocaml])
[00:04:53] <Anarchos> but when i do 'dune build' i get ' No implementations provided for the following modules:          Dynlink referenced from src/ocp_indent_dynlink.cmxa(IndentLoader)"
[00:05:16] <rgrinberg> is dynlink listed in the dune file?
[00:11:51] <Anarchos> yse
[00:11:57] <Anarchos> yes
[00:12:08] <Anarchos> rgrinberg it is ocp-indent
[00:12:48] <rgrinberg> is it listed in the ocp_indent_dynlink library though?
[00:13:05] <Anarchos> yes too
[00:13:47] <Anarchos> rgrinberg I think it is misisng in my opam switch but i don't know where to look for
[00:14:12] <rgrinberg> ocamlfind list should include dynlink
[00:14:17] <rgrinberg> if it's indeed present
[00:15:46] <Anarchos> it says dynlink             (version: [distributed with Ocaml])
[00:44:43] <octachron> Anarchos, if it is manually build compiler, have you checked that you have a dynlink library available?
[00:45:21] <Anarchos> it was missing in .opam/5.00+trunk/ocaml. i am rebuilding and copying it by hand

[00:51:40] <Guest17> hello! I have a weird task
[00:52:04] <Guest17> I want to compile a lang I'm working on to OCaml because the semantics are very similar
[00:52:45] <Guest17> and I'm not really interested in implementing it correctly
[00:52:55] <Guest17> any advice/opinions?
[00:53:46] <Guest17> for starters I would really like not to work with the standard library
[01:00:32] <d_bot> <Emile Trotignon> I think you should do a small replicate of the ocaml ast, and most likely a printer with pprint instead of format. I have done this here : https://github.com/EmileTrotignon/embedded_ocaml_templates/tree/master/src/common/ocaml, but this is a little specialised for the needs of this project
[01:01:22] <d_bot> <Emile Trotignon> This does use the stdlib, but you could switch it to Core easily I guess
[01:01:30] <d_bot> <Emile Trotignon> pprint really is a very nice library

[01:29:33] <Corbin> Aw, they left.
[01:30:16] <Corbin> I very much wish I could target something lower-level than OCaml ASTs. I almost wish malfunction were official, although I think that that's a monkey's-paw wish.

[18:40:35] <Leonidas> Pretty impressive. Though with polymorphic variants that feels quite easily achievable ;-)
[18:41:39] <Leonidas> https://gist.github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/8980e037d968485535234d69dda194f8 I feel like I am missing a tiny little bit but the compiler just somehow doesn't see that OpamPackageName.t and OpamPackage.Name.t is the same
[18:42:57] <octachron> the constraint "OpamPackageName : Printable" makes OpamPackageName.t abstract (and unusable)
[18:44:33] <Leonidas> ah, adding the sharing constraint there helps

[20:39:07] <d_bot> <cemerick> I was digging around after dealing with a well-hidden exception that was occurring in an lwt promise, and came across this https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/840
[20:39:28] <d_bot> <cemerick> > Another confusing thing is that stack trace propagation with Lwt currently only happens when using lwt_ppx by producing calls to Lwt.backtrace_bind. This is not the case with >>= and the new (let*) operators. In addition to that the docs for Lwt_ppx hide the fact that the ppx will produce better traces.
[20:39:59] <d_bot> <cemerick> suffice it to say, I leaned back and literally said "oof" 😬

[20:43:11] <d_bot> <cemerick> is it so crazy to think that operators should themselves be potential ppx extension points? Seems like absent some mechanism for intervention like that, the above is sort of intractible.

[20:48:11] <companion_cube> you can redefine (let*) to be backtrace_bind
[20:48:16] <companion_cube> I don't know why it's not the case
