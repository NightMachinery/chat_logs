[10:44:00] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i uninstalled the V store and thats one way to do it
[10:44:15] <AryaK[m]> you can uninstall with adb uninstall right
[10:44:18] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> AryaK[m]: doesn't it just take search results from other search engines ;-;
[10:44:23] <AryaK[m]> chris titus has a guide on it
[10:44:25] <Zbnssn[m]> or any type of systemless root via magisk?
[10:44:25] <Zbnssn[m]> then u can use app from fdroid called "debloater" adn remove
[10:44:29] <AryaK[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: yes but many search engines
[10:44:36] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> idk how to root vivo v23
[10:44:48] <Zbnssn[m]> oh cool then u can use adb too
[10:44:49] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: ```
[10:44:49] <iamak[m]> adb shell
[10:44:49] <iamak[m]> pm uninstall --user 0 <package>
[10:44:49] <iamak[m]> ```

[10:45:33] <AryaK[m]> Zbnssn[m]: mobile phones never patch their stuff
[10:45:38] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> lol
[10:46:01] <iamak[m]> Only latest androids are affected by that no?
[10:46:02] <iamak[m]> Android 12 only iirc

[10:47:08] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> kek
[10:47:43] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: I think you can root using dirtypipe then. If you try it, tell me if it works I'm curious
[10:47:53] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> oK
[10:47:54] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> is it on fdroid
[10:47:58] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: It's visible in settings for me
[10:48:09] <AryaK[m]> i have android 12
[10:48:12] <AryaK[m]> *10
[10:48:18] <AryaK[m]> so i am not vulnerable
[10:48:23] <AryaK[m]> i was trying dirtycow
[10:48:23] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> I see
[10:48:31] <AryaK[m]> but its getting header err.h not found
[10:48:39] <AryaK[m]> even tho the header is there in /usr/include
[10:48:44] <labrador> AryaK[m], lmao dirty cow
[10:48:46] <labrador> whats that
[10:48:57] <AryaK[m]> older kernel vuln
[10:48:57] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> how do i dirty pipe
[10:49:04] <Zbnssn[m]> there are guides online for windows v simple https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmdfI9JXSf8
[10:49:06] <AryaK[m]> https://github.com/j0nk0/GetRoot-Android-DirtyCow/
[10:49:15] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> nice
[10:49:25] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Wait
[10:49:29] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> its temporary ;-;
[10:49:34] <AryaK[m]> yes
[10:49:39] <AryaK[m]> temporary root is enough
[10:49:44] <AryaK[m]> you modify a systen
[10:49:46] <AryaK[m]> file
[10:49:49] <AryaK[m]> and then get out
[10:49:52] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> man there is no root guide on vivo v23
[10:49:53] <AryaK[m]> so your bank apps and stuff
[10:49:55] <AryaK[m]> still work
[10:50:07] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah you just need root privileged to uninstall then back to normal
[10:50:13] <AryaK[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: some phoens like my nokia 5.3 cant even unlock bootloader
[10:50:13] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i see
[10:50:19] <AryaK[m]> so magisk is impossible ig
[10:50:20] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Bruh
[10:50:30] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> no developer options?
[10:50:41] <AryaK[m]> cheaper phones usually dont allow
[10:50:53] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i guess i can live with these 2 apps
[10:50:53] <Zbnssn[m]> rooted phone 24/7 will make ur life miserable because any app that detects like banking or even whatsapp will not provide u any service
[10:50:53] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> :/
[10:50:55] <AryaK[m]> extremely cheap and extremely high end have to be avoided
[10:51:11] <iamak[m]> I'm always amazed how different phones work compared to PCs
[10:51:13] <Zbnssn[m]> magisk has/had the feature of magiskhide for this purpose
[10:51:18] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i am 13 so i don't do banking + i am hate fu- facebook so no whatsapp
[10:51:29] <AryaK[m]> Zbnssn[m]: i have a fully rooted phone with magisk and stock lineage without even microg
[10:51:31] <iamak[m]> Even the most basic PCs have BIOS access
[10:51:33] <AryaK[m]> but its battery is kinda dead
[10:51:34] <AryaK[m]> so rip
[10:51:44] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: Why no micro g?
[10:51:47] <iamak[m]> No banking apps?
[10:52:14] <AryaK[m]> i dont even use the phone
[10:52:20] <AryaK[m]> because battery doesnt last
[10:52:25] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> should i remove google maps
[10:52:25] <iamak[m]> Zbnssn[m]: WhatsApp works on my rooted phone
[10:52:26] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> idk
[10:52:27] <AryaK[m]> everything is on my nokia 5.3
[10:52:43] <AryaK[m]> iamak[m]: cant you use banking webapps and stuff
[10:52:46] <Zbnssn[m]> I have magisk and I have banking apps on it... just used magisk hide... tho I'm not really sure with the project... the og dev got bought by google and now Is removing features like hide or patching them in google
[10:52:57] <AryaK[m]> also is there any foss  upi app?
[10:52:59] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: If you want alternative, there is OSMAnd+ which I had good exp on 1 phone but bad on other
[10:53:11] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> huh
[10:53:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> let me chec
[10:53:28] <iamak[m]> Zbnssn[m]: I didn't update magisk since he got Google job
[10:53:29] <Zbnssn[m]> why dont you just flash an os my guy

[10:54:51] <Zbnssn[m]> 24k stars
[10:54:57] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> 6k forks
[10:55:10] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah
[10:55:17] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> and only 36 issues
[10:55:19] <Zbnssn[m]> some people are maintaining on their own fork
[10:55:48] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> damn
[10:55:48] <Zbnssn[m]> 3996 closed
[10:55:53] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Lmao
[10:56:23] <Zbnssn[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: there are plenty ways I just looked up

[10:57:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> its just vivo v23 lol
[10:57:50] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> V23 5G is the model name

[10:58:49] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> but didn't want to order online cuz there would be no service and shit
[10:59:23] <Zbnssn[m]> i just use it for flashing different oses and some development work dont even put a sim in it
[10:59:31] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> nice
[10:59:44] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> ight i think im done debloating my phon
[11:00:09] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> + for some reason apt can't get mirrors on my linux mint installation
[11:00:17] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i think i am gonna install ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS version
[11:01:47] <Zbnssn[m]> if i were you I'd backup my data on desktop
[11:01:47] <Zbnssn[m]> flash a open source vanilla iso  (no google crap)
[11:01:47] <Zbnssn[m]> and them install all ur apps from fdroid and aurora store... 
[11:01:47] <Zbnssn[m]> use micro g if they are dependent on google
[11:02:13] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> the vanced micro g?
[11:02:26] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> > <Zbnssn> if i were you I'd backup my data on desktop... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/36ffadc7296c359425895d863f0bcf98507aee0f)
[11:03:34] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> let me see if lineage exists on it
[11:03:58] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> nop
[11:04:42] <Zbnssn[m]> nvm just checked vivo phones don't allow their bootloaders to be unlocked so there arent any custom roms available
[11:04:55] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> there is OEM unlocking in the developer options
[11:04:56] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], yeah the only way is to exploit
[11:05:11] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> LETS EXPLOIT THEN
[11:05:17] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> wait i am n00b
[11:05:24] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], whats your android version?
[11:05:32] <labrador> How long ago was the last update
[11:05:34] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> funtouch os 1
[11:05:36] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> * funtouch os 12
[11:05:41] <Zbnssn[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: yeah but that will stay locked like the option will be there but you wont be able to  click on it
[11:05:42] <labrador> so android 12?
[11:05:47] <labrador> lol
[11:05:58] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> prob
[11:06:05] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> yep
[11:06:06] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> android 12
[11:06:16] <Zbnssn[m]> onplus and xiaomi phones are better at this... idk why samsung and other android phones have to suck so much
[11:06:25] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i just turned on oem unlocking
[11:06:28] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> idk wth u talking about
[11:06:33] <Zbnssn[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: you could brick ur phone
[11:06:38] <labrador> then you need to keep it in a drawer offline for like half a year and wait ElJohnSepiol[m]. Usually there's atleast 2-3 local root vulns per year in the linux kernel
[11:06:39] * ElJohnSepiol[m] uploaded an image: (60KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/4927f8f093ffcbc3d5ae2459e755d50d4930478c/image.jpeg >
[11:06:49] <labrador> And atleast one has a POC you can just exploit
[11:07:13] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i turned on the oem unlocking feature
[11:07:56] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> POC?
[11:08:04] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], proof of concept code
[11:08:11] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i see
[11:08:20] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> but OEM unlocking is a option
[11:08:28] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i just need fastboot right
[11:08:55] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], well yeah...I still think vivo phones can't be unlocked but sure try it
[11:09:10] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> let me try it then
[11:09:21] <labrador> nice
[11:10:16] <Zbnssn[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: still i can't find any custom rom for it
[11:10:20] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], all phones that can easily get their bootloaders unlocked are expensive af
[11:10:24] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Shieeeet
[11:10:40] <labrador> what
[11:10:55] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> no custom rom for it
[11:11:29] <labrador> well ElJohnSepiol[m] is twrp supported?
[11:11:33] <labrador> Just check and see
[11:11:42] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> whats that
[11:11:48] <labrador> I know los recovery isn't
[11:11:55] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador: lol xiamo redmi note 7 pro (violet) cost me 6k easily unlocked it's bootloader
[11:12:08] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> shieeeeeeeeeeeeeet
[11:12:10] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], its a recovery...using it allows you to atleast root your phone
[11:12:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i guess i will just stick with this degoogled
[11:12:22] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], I don't wanna spit my data at xiamo
[11:12:27] <labrador> xiaomi
[11:12:33] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> xiomi
[11:12:45] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i knew i should have gotten one plus nord 2
[11:12:48] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> ;—;
[11:12:49] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador: how ? i'm not running mi's os
[11:13:30] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], they require a mi account and other fun stuff like ur phone number before allowing you to unlock the bootloader
[11:13:51] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> just send fake stuff
[11:13:52] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], heck oneplus 7-8-9 would have worked too
[11:13:56] <labrador> Los supports them all
[11:14:00] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], won't work
[11:14:03] <labrador> it verifies
[11:14:08] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah true that's just one time so I gave them a burner mail and otp
[11:14:17] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> oneplus 8 wasn't at store
[11:14:20] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> and 9 was too expensive
[11:14:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> like 17k rupees more expensive
[11:14:31] <labrador> lmaoo
[11:14:46] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah never spending all that money on a phone
[11:14:54] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> lol
[11:15:04] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i mean it can emulate resident evil 4 so i have no problem with it
[11:15:16] <labrador> I dunno I don't really have a use for a phone if I just use a voip number
[11:15:19] <Zbnssn[m]> phones literally are tracking you and most possible listening and watching you 24/7
[11:15:25] <iamak[m]> Bruh `element-desktop` on Arch used 100% CPU on 3 cores ;_;
[11:15:31] <labrador> so I probably could leave my phone
[11:15:31] <iamak[m]> Anyone know of a fix?
[11:15:39] <labrador> iamak[m], constantly?
[11:15:41] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Hmmm
[11:15:42] <Zbnssn[m]> i have my phone lying in a corner most times, it's later i see the messages
[11:15:49] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> maybe i should dip my phone in sulfuric acid
[11:15:56] <labrador> you could attach gdb to it iamak[m] 
[11:16:01] <labrador> kinda extremem ik
[11:16:25] <iamak[m]> labrador: It wasn't working so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. Login screen takes 100% 3 cores and the program freezes
[11:16:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i am just rip the gps tracker and the microphone from this thing then
[11:16:28] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> kek
[11:16:35] <Zbnssn[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: yeah you shouldn't worry much
[11:16:45] <Zbnssn[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: not that easy it's not some librem5
[11:16:52] <labrador> i would break the camera tho ElJohnSepiol[m] 
[11:16:57] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Hmmm
[11:16:58] <labrador> A screw driver will finish it off
[11:16:59] <iamak[m]> labrador: I have never used a debugger for my own programs ;_
[11:17:00] <iamak[m]> * programs ;_:
[11:17:01] <iamak[m]> * programs ;_;
[11:17:03] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> shieeeet
[11:17:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i am gonna trade it for oneplus 8 i guess
[11:17:17] <labrador> a hammer and a screwdriver*
[11:17:17] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> how much is oneplus 8
[11:17:30] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Lol just root and disable all perms using appops
[11:17:42] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> thats the thing
[11:17:42] <labrador> iamak[m], can't root it lmao
[11:17:42] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i can't
[11:17:47] <iamak[m]> F
[11:17:53] <iamak[m]> Wait Android 12 na?
[11:17:54] <labrador> How do you even root anything without a bootloader unlock
[11:17:56] <iamak[m]> Try Dirty Pipe
[11:18:15] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> holy fucking macaroni
[11:18:16] <labrador> iamak[m], can dirty pipe work on android 11 too ;__;
[11:18:20] <labrador> Give me hope
[11:18:20] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> oneplus 8 expensive
[11:18:21] <labrador> pls
[11:18:28] <iamak[m]> Kernel 5.8+ I thnk
[11:18:58] <iamak[m]> Afaik only A12 has 5.8_
[11:19:05] <iamak[m]> s/8_/8+/
[11:19:08] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i am gonna trade this for nord 2
[11:19:09] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> shieeet
[11:19:31] <Zbnssn[m]> iamak[m]: yeah I restrict several apps that don't need internet...network access this way
[11:19:45] <iamak[m]> > Due to the fact that Linux kernel version 5.8 (or above) has only been an Android option since Android 12, legacy devices aren’t affected. However, smartphones based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, MediaTek Dimensity 8000 and Dimensity 9000, Samsung Exynos 2200, and the Google Tensor SoC are vulnerable to the Dirty Pipe flaw because of their launch kernel builds.

[11:33:55] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> ok back to linux
[11:34:05] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> why did canonical die so badly
[11:34:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i forgot the thing was it ubuntu touch or edge
[11:34:49] <labrador> touch
[11:35:32] <iamak[m]> <ElJohnSepiol[m]> "i installed gentoo when i was 12..." <- I installed Fedora with help from my cousin on a HDD and forgot about it after installation. Found the HDD 2 months back
[11:35:47] <iamak[m]> It was Fedora 20 I think
[11:36:00] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i found my old external 2 tb drive with all my stuff when i used to use windows like days ago
[11:36:03] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> it has so many memories
[11:36:23] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], for how long have you been using linux lmao
[11:37:30] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> 5 months
[11:37:31] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> kek
[11:37:42] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> it has 1.7 years of memories
[11:37:56] <iamak[m]> Element has experimental IRC like display wow
[11:38:21] <iamak[m]> I prefer the default one though. IRC like display feels crammed
[11:38:44] <labrador> yeah everyone here is pretty new ElJohnSepiol[m] 
[11:38:49] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: 
[11:38:49] <iamak[m]> O read it as 17 lol

[11:38:57] <labrador> Did they get eaten by a dragon or something
[11:39:03] <iamak[m]> labrador: New to Linux?
[11:39:10] <labrador> iamak[m], ye
[11:39:11] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> they went to mac os for job
[11:39:21] <labrador> I've been in it for about an year
[11:39:23] <iamak[m]> I have been using for ~5 years now
[11:39:27] <labrador> iamak[m], oh
[11:39:28] <iamak[m]> Idk if that's old or new
[11:39:32] <iamak[m]> xD
[11:39:33] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> 5 years 💀
[11:39:35] <labrador> thats intermediate
[11:39:36] <iamak[m]> But to be fair
[11:39:51] <iamak[m]> I have "power used" Linux since lockdown only
[11:40:02] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> in 5 month i gained lot of linux knowledge cuz i have literally nothing else to do
[11:40:08] <labrador> iamak[m], old would be say...getting linux off in 1996 with cds bought from a barnes and nobles or something
[11:40:27] <labrador> We don't have many of those in india those...guess you can't run linux without a computer
[11:40:30] <iamak[m]> I don't think Linux was popular in India back then
[11:40:35] <iamak[m]> Because
[11:40:39] <labrador> iamak[m], no computers
[11:40:47] <iamak[m]> Most of the Linux Dev was focused in US and EU
[11:40:50] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> ight imma head out
[11:41:00] <labrador> ok
[11:41:20] <iamak[m]> labrador: People had computers lol (not as much as US or EU) but there used to be computers
[11:41:24] <iamak[m]> I remember using DOS in early 2000s
[11:41:27] <labrador> iamak[m], well mostly university students or cs grads...we didn't have many at the time
[11:41:40] <labrador> Its the cost with being in a 3rd world country
[11:41:44] <labrador> always gets things later
[11:41:49] <iamak[m]> iamak[m]: It was my cousin's uncle's computer
[11:41:59] <iamak[m]> labrador: Nowadays not really
[11:42:41] <iamak[m]> Nowadays with the Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune emerging as IT Hubs, we are up to date on tech
[11:43:05] <iamak[m]> labrador: I think you mean poor :p
[11:43:05] <iamak[m]> (3rd world doesn't mean poor)
[11:43:24] <labrador> iamak[m], well india is still poor by gdp per capita
[11:43:32] <labrador> Not really "3rd world" tho
[11:43:42] <iamak[m]> India has always been 3rd world
[11:44:01] <iamak[m]> What do you think the terms 1st, 2nd and 3rd world mean?
[11:44:06] <labrador> well iamak[m] from its independence yes
[11:44:18] <iamak[m]> 3rd world = countries who were non aligned during cold war
[11:44:38] <iamak[m]> So even if we become #1 economy, we will be a 3rd world country
[11:45:13] <iamak[m]> 😅
[11:45:34] <labrador> not really iamak[m] most people nowadsays use it to point to a  shithole
[11:45:40] <labrador> As in poor country
[11:45:43] <labrador> like vietnam
[11:46:03] <labrador> That cold war meaning is gone now since the blocs don't exist anymore
[11:46:27] <iamak[m]> They started meaning something again recently 
[11:46:39] <iamak[m]> Since RUS-UKR war
[11:46:59] <labrador> maybe
[11:47:05] <iamak[m]> But yeah I get your point
[11:47:33] <iamak[m]> Has anyone here worked with Bluetooth?
[11:48:04] <labrador> as in?
[11:48:19] <iamak[m]> Configuring Bluetooth
[11:48:36] <iamak[m]> I was reading the official docs but it's too much theory ;_;
[11:48:44] <iamak[m]> Reminds me of my IoT class
[11:48:57] <labrador> nah the most I've done is install the firmware and drivers plus pusleaudio-blutetooth
[11:49:55] <iamak[m]> I am trying to configure my PC such that my phone will recognize it as a bluetooth headset and not a PC
[11:50:13] <iamak[m]> That way I can use my PC to accept calls when it's connected to my phone
[11:50:18] <iamak[m]> Peak laziness
[11:50:20] <iamak[m]> xD
[11:50:20] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> remember when rms was sad that his netbook laptop got stolen
[11:50:42] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> that laptop could run 100% free software and was gone from stores
[11:51:02] <labrador> 100% chadness
[11:51:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> then he bought thinkpad with core 2 duo
[11:51:43] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> he cried
[11:52:01] <iamak[m]> Lol why
[11:52:03] <labrador> i would too if i was rms
[11:52:13] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> he lost his laptop and passport and visa
[11:52:15] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> on airport

[12:03:27] <labrador> iamak[m], I wanna be like tat
[12:03:29] <AryaK[m]> lol

[12:03:51] <iamak[m]> I get trying to be minimal
[12:03:56] <iamak[m]> But
[12:04:03] <labrador> iamak[m], cuz mastery of the cli is important
[12:04:05] <AryaK[m]> other than searching and meetings  ig
[12:04:07] <labrador> Its the op interface
[12:04:14] <iamak[m]> Using TUI for browsers is counter productive
[12:04:20] <iamak[m]> labrador: I know that
[12:04:29] <iamak[m]> I use TUI when possible lol
[12:04:38] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> my cousins think i am crazy for using open source shit
[12:04:47] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> my one cousin thought linux couldn't run youtube
[12:04:58] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: And you think they are crazy because they don't :p
[12:05:15] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> iamak[m]: i don't think they are crazy
[12:05:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> they just don't know about big tech

[12:06:25] <AryaK[m]> w3m can display images btw
[12:06:26] <iamak[m]> I showed them Bromite and they liked it
[12:06:34] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: I know this exists
[12:06:36] <iamak[m]> But
[12:06:41] <iamak[m]> Most web is designed for GUI
[12:06:54] <iamak[m]> Using it without GUI will be counterproductive

[12:06:58] <Zbnssn[m]> iamak[m]: very I used this thing called elinks? it does not do well on modern web
[12:07:09] <iamak[m]> It's on Arch?
[12:07:13] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> emacs based tho

[13:13:47] <Aaron[m]1> I would recommend to debloat your phone using adb
[13:17:14] <Aaron[m]1> You can try with adb shell and pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package name> and replace package name with apps you want to remove and apps from these lists https://www.androidsage.com/2018/09/01/list-of-bloatware-remove-uninstall-android-device-without-root/ https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/debloat-vivo-z1-pro.3957462/ 
[13:17:14] <Aaron[m]1> or you can do it through a gui with https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater

[13:19:38] <Aaron[m]1> You can even replace system apps with open source apps like youtube -> newpipe,phone-> simple contacts calculator-> simple calculator vivo browser->bromite etc
[13:23:06] <sla[m]12> Aaron[m]1: Kek, if there's one phone that we should never buy it's oppo and vivo

[13:29:23] <iamak[m]> It gets suppressed and warns me about low battery very late

[17:13:49] <telegram_1346084> Guys, how to get scripts in ~/.local/bin in dmenu and rofi?
[17:17:49] <gtlsgamr> add ~/.local/bin to your PATH VARIABLE
[17:18:13] <telegram_1346084> In bash i have it
[17:18:32] <gtlsgamr> export PATH="${PATH:/home/username/.local/bin}"
[17:18:43] <gtlsgamr> telegram_1346084: what do you mean?
[17:19:00] <telegram_1346084> rofi says "Failed to execute child process"
[17:19:31] <telegram_1346084> I have this already
[17:19:31] <telegram_1346084> export PATH="~/.local/bin:/home/i/.config/surfraw/elvi:$PATH"
[17:19:47] <gtlsgamr> what is the script?
[17:20:12] <telegram_1346084> Normal bash scripts, in local/bin directory
[17:20:55] <gtlsgamr> try adding 
[17:21:31] <gtlsgamr> export PATH="${PATH}:/home/i/.local/bin"
[17:21:36] <gtlsgamr> to ypur /etc/profile
[17:21:38] <gtlsgamr> then reboot
[17:22:09] <telegram_1346084> profile?
[17:22:46] <telegram_1346084> Also, i have not given extensions like sh to the script name
[17:23:21] <telegram_1346084> what about xprofile?
[17:28:31] <gtlsgamr> are your scripts executable?
[17:28:34] <gtlsgamr> chmod +x scriptname
[17:34:32] <telegram_1346084> Ok.. It got solved
[17:34:36] <gtlsgamr> What happn
[17:34:55] <telegram_1346084> Idk why i dont answer when i deep search.
[17:34:55] <telegram_1346084> But randomly it appears somewhere
[17:35:07] <gtlsgamr> ?
[17:35:23] <telegram_1346084> I set the path in bash_profile
[17:35:26] <telegram_1346084> Now it works
[17:36:09] <telegram_1346084> Wait.... no
[17:36:23] <telegram_1346084> I set it in .xinitrc itself. It works
[17:37:29] <telegram_1346084> Thank you pal
[17:38:45] <telegram_1346084> * i dont get answer when
[17:45:14] <gtlsgamr> telegram_1346084: bash_profile I think runs in every shell. You should set path in a place which will run systemwide(If you want dmenu to recognise it), hence /etc/profile.
[17:45:24] <gtlsgamr> or .xinitrc
[17:45:33] <gtlsgamr> both work
[17:55:06] <iamak[m]> I create a symlink in `/usr/local/bin`😂
[17:55:26] <iamak[m]> Because I have scripts in too many different locations
[18:04:02] <telegram_1346084> <iamak[m]> "I create a symlink in `/usr/..." <- Yeah, i was doing it before.
[18:04:02] <telegram_1346084> Its an extra step for new scripts 😂
[18:04:02] <telegram_1346084> So... Set off the path
[18:22:29] <Zbnssn[m]> <Aaron[m]1> "Your phone is quite new and also..." <- redmi note 7 pro is new? I got it as a handmedown
