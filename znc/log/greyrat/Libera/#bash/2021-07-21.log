[00:01:33] <physikoi> that definitely gets me closer! Command now ends with `|awk '/Fan/{printf "%s",$0} END {print ""} fflush(stdout) '`. Prints out each line as it comes and gets rid of newline. Putting aside the newline thing (XY), I just want the each subsequent line to overwrite the last in stdout

[00:05:16] <twkm> i'd tput el before the \r, which suggests not using tr.

[05:49:47] <eggbean> IPC means Inter-process communication?
[05:50:00] <eggbean> How is this an IPC?
[05:50:24] <ormaaj> Just not many cases where you'd eval shell output, but the shell needs to both run the file then introspect its own state, which is fine as the shell guarantees you're getting a properly formatted command
[05:50:45] <eggbean> ok
[05:50:47] <ormaaj> But you do have to ensure sourcing the file doesn't create any output
[05:51:04] <ormaaj> this is probably better:
[05:51:19] <ormaaj> eval "$(source file >/dev/null && typeset -p varname)"
[05:52:32] <eggbean> ok. But what sort of thing could cause output? Can't think of an example 
[05:54:09] <eggbean> What I was thinking of as a possible problem in this case was another file in /etc that is called *release
[05:54:22] <ormaaj> any code that writes to stdout. The subshell calls source which eval's the file, the subshell then runs `typeset -p` and the parent eval's the combined output
[05:54:41] <eggbean> ok thanks
[05:57:45] <eggbean> I just tried this on a few hosts and I found that one of them causes a problem in that the file included ID= twice. This is on a aarch64 aws graviton instance which has both ID="ec2" and ID=debian. Damn.
[05:59:18] <ormaaj> eh? The variable namespace only allows unique variable names. Or you're trying to avoid overwriting an existing varname?

[08:28:17] <Ademan> so I'm having some surprising behavior redirections, background commands, and functions. https://pastebin.com/fxhAhKRE my output indicates that it blocks at L22, and the function never returns. This is similar to https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/218515/why-wont-function-return-until-background-process-ends but I've already redirected stdin, stdout, stderr (unless I've done it incorrectly?) or do I 
[08:28:17] <pasteban> Paste is available without ads on https://pastebin.com/raw/fxhAhKRE
[08:28:23] <Ademan> need to close the original stdin/stdout/stderr first or something?
[08:34:01] <e36freak> same issue with the command substitution
[08:34:19] <e36freak> you've forked a background process inside a command substitution and it's going to have to wait for it to finish before it can get all of its output
[08:34:35] <ormaaj> Ademan: not quite sure what you're doing there but I'd use a coproc maybe.

[08:37:51] <Ademan> e36freak: "it's going to have to wait for it to finish before it can get all of its output" why? the background process' stdout and stderr have nothing to do with the command substitution, they're redirected elsewhere
[08:38:22] <e36freak> it doesn't really know that
[08:38:28] <e36freak> it just sees a forked process in the child and waits for it

[22:45:13] <hyper_ch> better don't
[22:45:49] <pragma-> It seems like it'd be used more for video games than for technical conversation.
[22:46:15] <pragma-> is there a discord room for bash?
[22:46:22] <twkm> you could make another technical discussion server.
[22:46:22] <hyper_ch> some friends use it for a game
[22:46:23] <pragma-> would you share a screenshot of it?
[22:46:32] <pragma-> i'm rather curious what it looks like for you
[22:46:43] <hyper_ch> currently "update failed"

[23:00:47] <wwilliam> pssh -i -h servers "screen -r && exit"

[23:05:38] <twkm> screen wants a tty, so either the ssh's need a -t or you need to ignore screen and kill the program that is in the screen.
[23:05:47] <wwilliam> ps aux|grep -i screen gives this:
[23:05:53] <wwilliam> SCREEN -m -d -S rd4  bash -c /opt/wrapperLinux.sh;exec bash
[23:06:46] <twkm> so consider kill -HUP the bash's that are children of screen.

[23:09:31] <wwilliam> SCREEN -m -d -S rd4  bash -c /opt/wrapperLinux.sh;exec bash
[23:10:57] <twkm> if it is still runninng, otherwise bash is.  beware there might be other bash processes, not under screen.

[23:13:08] <twkm> why do you run bash after the script?
[23:13:24] <wwilliam> so the screen would not close I am stupid.

[23:14:32] <twkm> anyway, perhaps you just want to use ''screen -X kill''.
[23:15:06] <wwilliam> pssh -i -h servers "screen -X kill"
[23:15:09] <wwilliam> like that?
[23:15:10] <twkm> if multiple screen sessions are running you need ''screen -S sessionname -X kill'' to kill a specific session.
[23:15:15] <wwilliam> no
[23:15:22] <wwilliam> Only one screen I have.
[23:16:13] <twkm> if rd4 is a fixed/knowm session name i'd use it to be safe.
[23:16:51] <wwilliam> excellent thank you that did kill the screen in all the servers
