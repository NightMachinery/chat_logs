[00:49:55] <lantech19446> kubblai: that is a fantastic find
[00:50:07] <lantech19446> I'd have to intentionally misspell things to use it though
[00:50:23] <kubblai> you'd do that tho right? :)
[00:50:24] <rawtaz> one day someone will supply chain attack that shit into correcting something to rm -rf /
[00:51:01] <kubblai> then you will type fuck
[00:51:49] <rawtaz> oh yeah and it will fix it. smart!
[00:55:14] <lantech19446> kubblai: most likely rawtaz: I wouldn't even be mad
[00:55:32] <rawtaz> hehe
[00:55:33] <rawtaz> fair enough
[00:58:52] <lantech19446> I seriously fucking hate sysprep and wds why does sysprep succeed if there's something in the image that won't let it boot correctly like wtf
[01:00:23] <kubblai> i hated the sysprep looping reboots i used to get but i havent used it in years
[01:00:45] <kubblai> and the SID issues
[01:00:48] <rawtaz> because its a windows product. if it didnt allow itself to succeed if there's something in the image that won't boot properly, it would never complete.
[01:03:09] <lantech19446> I still need to sysprep even if i'm using MDT so that's kinda out too, what's the best option here to get away from WDS I know ansible won't install an OS will pdq deploy?
[01:07:33] <slaughter> I don't think that sentence had enough initialisms
[01:10:06] <lantech19446> i mean at least they aren't for shit that no one else but me can understand though
[01:11:12] <kubblai> tbh no offense to the clever ppl here but i doubt most ppl here know much about windows deployment tools
[01:12:02] <lantech19446> I can't be the only person still working on windoze
[01:12:51] <kubblai> i used to do WDS stuff back in the day
[01:13:48] <kubblai> but in the cloud times its only relevant for end users' laptops/desktops and usually lvl 1 oe 2 people do that stuff
[01:13:56] <kubblai> in my experience anyway
[01:14:42] <kubblai> my experience is limited tho so im probably wrong :)
[01:15:49] <lantech19446> I don't know who else to ask either, the people in #windows-server aren't going to be able to provide any other options
[01:17:50] *** Quits: PublicWiFi (~PublicWiF@user/publicwifi) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[01:18:00] <kubblai> fitting
[01:19:06] <lantech19446> I really want to switch all these computers to linux but i'm a ways away from that yet
[01:21:33] <kubblai> why dont you go for something like wise terminals and a centrally managed beefy RDP server?
[01:23:56] <kubblai> or amazon worksapces and a dumb terminal
[01:24:20] <kubblai> then you could about provisioning amazon workspaces and write some tf
[01:24:21] <lantech19446> don't really have the budget for the server or the terminals 
[01:24:26] <rawtaz> booo
[01:24:45] <lantech19446> hmm that second one might be an option I'll have to look into it
[01:26:24] <rawtaz> for windows thin clients i highly recommend thinlinx, very cheap and runs on a raspberry pi or even zero i think. cnat get any better :) thinlinx.com
[01:26:48] <rawtaz> instead of them expensive crappy junk clients the big vendors sell
[01:27:37] <rawtaz> (did i mention it has a central management app where you can manage all the thin clients? if not, let me know and i'll tell you!)
[01:28:35] <slaughter> I literally haven't touched a windows machine of any kind in years
[01:29:15] <rawtaz> wow. you lucky fuck.
[01:29:17] <rawtaz> >_<
[01:30:02] <lantech19446> yea you really are lucky
[01:30:25] <lantech19446> rawtaz: what kind of performance am I ever going to get running windows on a pi though
[01:30:39] <kubblai> you're only running an rdp client to connect to workspaces
[01:31:22] <lantech19446> ooo ok I didn't realize that was still in that whole line of thought
[01:32:25] <rawtaz> it supports rdp and a hell of a lot of other stuff as well. and FWIW theyve streamed high quality video to those things and its not a problem at all
[01:32:37] <kubblai> how did you think you'd connect to a windows instance running in aws?
[01:33:47] <kubblai> sorry if that was a bit agressive :) i mean if you didnt know. amazon workspaces you generally connect to a desktop over rdp
[01:34:11] <rawtaz> one can really tell when you hate people, kubblai :-)
[01:34:21] <kubblai> aw
[01:34:24] <kubblai> <3 lantech19446 
[01:34:26] <lantech19446> I got that but i thought this was a separate idea, i'm used to thin clients where the OS is embedded in the client
[01:34:44] <rawtaz> which OS? the client always needs an OS
[01:34:47] <kubblai> it does have an OS still just a tiny one
[01:35:05] <kubblai> hes probably used something like windows pe
[01:36:52] <lantech19446> we had wyse thin clients years ago that ran xp that's the extent of my experience with thin clients

[01:37:54] <kubblai> i dont understand why ppl insist omn paying os licenses for dumb terminals only to coonect to further licensed boxen but heyho
[01:38:18] <rawtaz> in the case of thinlinx they do it because it rocks
[01:38:24] <rawtaz> what else would you use kubblai ?
[01:38:39] <kubblai> a linux lightweight distro
[01:40:05] *** Joins: PublicWiFi (~PublicWiF@user/publicwifi)
[01:41:32] <lantech19446> I would want something made specifically for handling this scenario that way as soon as it loaded it automatically opened the connection otherwise i'd have to go around and do it for them every time it's for people who are limited at best in computer use
[01:43:26] <kubblai> i rolled one myself one
[01:43:34] <kubblai> s/one/once
[01:44:43] <kubblai> we had a vdi solution running vmware vdi with win 7 i forget the distro i used but i made it so when it started up it logged in as a low priv user and launched the vdi client with no way of exiting except to shutdown the machine
[01:45:35] <kubblai> any issues you just restarted the terminal
[01:46:15] <kubblai> i never got implemented coz they wanted windows in case the network connection didnt work but the next step was going to be to push the os to the machine at boot
[01:46:48] <lantech19446> so kinda like citrix?
[01:51:20] <kubblai> yep. similar yes, their vdi solution not like the ms rdp solution with citrix built on top
[01:53:17] <lantech19446> right
[01:53:52] <lantech19446> so this iteration of building / sysprepping my vm is named fucksysprep
[01:54:22] <kubblai> lets hope it gets into the boot screen :)
[01:55:56] <lantech19446> this version does it's before I added whatever causes it not to boot I just have to figure out what it was
[01:56:42] <kubblai> heh it'll be funny when some kid asks the librarian whats fuck sysprep
[01:57:27] <lantech19446> I hope they do, i'll tell them i'm sysprep and their mom is fuck
[01:58:54] <kubblai> edgy...i like it :)
[02:01:22] <rawtaz> kubblai: you have much more usefulness from something like thinlinx though, cnat really compare that with a plain linux install :)

[02:03:53] <rawtaz> you can surely configure it adequately, but theres a difference in time and how optimized it is for various uhm hosts or what to call it
[02:03:57] <rawtaz> servers, i guess
[02:04:01] <rawtaz> and the central adminstration
[02:04:06] <rawtaz> thats the key thing i think
[02:04:13] *** Parts: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) ()
[02:04:19] <rawtaz> but perhaps you built the same thing, what do i know :P
[02:04:30] <lantech19446> if i really wanted to be an asshole i'd run ubuntu server in docker pulling the image from a remote host so it's the same every time and people would have to use lynx and vim
[02:04:44] <rawtaz> sghh
[02:04:55] <rawtaz> when are you going to give up on that ubuntu thing
[02:06:19] <lantech19446> it's just the easiest thing to give them
[02:09:01] * rawtaz never supports shit just because it's the easiest
[02:12:56] <lantech19446> yea but how much shit do you do with the  public?
[02:13:07] <rawtaz> how do you mean?
[02:13:18] <rawtaz> what public
[02:13:33] <slaughter> If y'all want a laugh/cry, enjoy my newly open sourced and overly complex method for sending Github Actions metrics to Cloudwatch - https://github.com/slaughtr/cloudwatch-build-metrics
[02:13:39] <lantech19446> I'm supporting computers that the average joe has to be able to walk in off the street and use there's no expectation of skill
[02:14:14] <rawtaz> oh right. thats why you use windows for them i presume.
[02:14:26] <rawtaz> because "everyone is dumb enough to use windows" :D
[02:14:37] <rawtaz> its the lowest possible denominator
[02:17:56] <kubblai> slaughter looks nice, but i'd also let ppl create the log group name as a var at the top
[02:18:07] <kubblai> instead of hardcoding it
[02:19:02] <kubblai> small comment tho for immense work :)
[02:19:12] <lantech19446> pretty much
[02:20:32] <slaughter> Lol yeah I just noticed that too. Most of my work to ready it for open sourcing was removing references to the company/products so I bet there's a few things like that
[02:21:12] <slaughter> Fun fact: that'll ship your logs, but I never got around to doing anything with them so there's a lot of work to do for it to be useful
[02:21:55] <kubblai> we're moving to github from atlassian soon so i would probably use that repo :)
[02:22:17] <kubblai> my company love having cloudwatch logs for everything that no one ever looks through
[02:22:39] <slaughter> Haha well it's perfect for that use case
[02:23:03] <slaughter> And it's proven working, I personally saw it run at least 500 times
[02:23:29] <kubblai> want me to raise a pr for the log group ?
[02:23:40] <slaughter> Hell yeah if you want to!
[02:23:44] <kubblai> ok!
[02:23:47] <slaughter> :D
[02:23:53] <kubblai> my first open sauce contribution :)
[02:23:59] <slaughter> My first OSS contributor!
[02:24:01] <slaughter> <3
[02:24:11] <slaughter> Let's get married and run away together
[02:25:49] <slaughter> The tests on it will continue to fail, I don't have my AWS creds in my personal github. I assume anyone using it would be forking or the like
[02:30:56] <kubblai> slaughter: do you prefer $LOG_GROUP_NAME as env var or secret. i prefer env var but it might be more annoying to keep setting it ?
[02:32:44] <slaughter> Since it's a composite action it's just `inputs` - env var or secret is then up to the action that calls it. And in that parent action I'd personally go for ~neither - LOG_GROUP_NAME would come from a secrets management tool
[02:33:36] <slaughter> That's just for consolidation purposes though. I think a log group name is probably fine as an env var instead of a Github secret because github secrets are annoying
[02:34:13] <rawtaz> omg you two

[02:41:14] <kubblai> ok slaughter htf do i raise a pr, we use bitbucket at work. i dont appear to be able to push to a branch, my github username is kubblai
[02:44:14] <slaughter> Fork the repo, add that fork as an origiin, put your work in a branch, push to your fork, go to your fork in GH and open a PR from there - you'll be able to target the upstream repo (my repo) in the PR
[02:45:04] <kubblai> ah ok
[02:45:09] <slaughter> You can delete your fork once that's merged if you want, but if you think you might end up doing more changes might be worth it to just leave it there
[02:46:19] <slaughter> It's a bit of a weird flow
[02:46:28] <slaughter> But also makes sense so :shrug:
[02:54:35] <rawtaz> you can also made the edits right there on github in their web ui
[02:55:09] <slaughter> Oh yeah true! And it does the exact same thing - creates a fork, edits the files in that fork on a new branch, opens a PR from fork -> upstream
[02:55:29] <slaughter> And if you accidentally hit that button enjoy having a random fork in your repo list :D
[02:59:32] <kubblai> ok done it phew. i suck at github apparently

[03:00:40] <slaughter> YAYYYYY
[03:00:50] <kubblai> now you can tear it apart
[03:00:54] <slaughter> I figured like 0 people would even look at that
[03:00:59] <slaughter> Let alone get a PR within an hour lol
[03:01:06] <slaughter> Nah that was a great PR, nothing to tear apart
[03:01:22] <slaughter> Approved, merged, it's in there!
