[00:01:16] <committer> bibble The file seems to be just fine, because if I hard code it other objects (include video links and metadata) in my array seem to be able to generate a screenshot from the mp4 video, if I use a local file.
[00:02:27] <committer> Looks like it might only be the first video that fails to get a screenshot generated from it when I try to do it with a local mp4, but the path is correct, I can open it on my computer without any issues.
[00:02:49] <committer> ffmpeg exited with code 1: C:\path/project/ffmpeg\input\video.mp4: Invalid data found when processing input

[02:12:19] <bencc1> can I split a video file on an arbitrary point (not keyframe) without re-encoding?
[02:13:46] <hyrcanus> I could split up to the keyframe without re-encoding and just re-encode that bit
[02:14:19] <hyrcanus> maybe some codecs and tools can do it also. idk.
[02:14:58] <hyrcanus> i imagine it would be possible to synthesize and insert a keyframe at any frame
[02:15:08] <bencc1> I have a keyframe every 120 seconds
[02:15:09] <hyrcanus> might not be super accurate
[02:15:14] <hyrcanus> i'm just musing
[02:15:43] <hyrcanus> during video playback you *do* have the state at any given time
[02:15:59] <bencc1> what state?
[02:16:00] <hyrcanus> so that could serve as a keyframe, theoretically.  if someone wrote the software to do it
[02:16:20] <hyrcanus> the 'jpeg' of the screen contents are there
[02:16:42] <bencc1> I'm not following
[02:16:46] <bencc1> state, jpeg...?
[02:16:54] <hyrcanus> i'm just imagining
[02:17:11] <hyrcanus> 'state' in the context of software is something you should look up and learn then
[02:17:16] <hyrcanus> it's part of our language
[02:17:38] <bencc1> I'm trying to create a mosaic that dynamically changes the source videos, sizes and position
[02:17:54] <bencc1> there is xstack plugin but doesn't support dynamic changes over time
[02:18:06] <bencc1> I know what a state is
[02:18:09] <hyrcanus> ok
[02:18:14] <hyrcanus> that sounds fun
[02:19:01] <hyrcanus> what does xstack do?

[06:22:01] <Atsuko> does anyone happen to know the max character length per line for subtiltes on bluray?
[06:34:58] <kepstin> bluray subtitles are images
[06:35:10] <kepstin> (so the question doesn't make sense)
[06:36:00] <kepstin> it's up to the person who makes the subs to pick a font size that results in readable text, and they normally use a proportional-width font, so there's no fixed number.
[06:36:49] <Atsuko> kepstin i converted .srt to pgs using tsmuxer
[06:37:03] <Atsuko> the end result were lines of subs that exceeded the video area and were cut off
[06:37:14] <Atsuko> so there has to be some limit to begin with
[06:37:39] <kepstin> then that's a bug in tsmuxer's font rendering when making the images :/
[06:37:48] <kepstin> (or maybe something you can configure)
[06:38:07] <Atsuko> is there a way to do srt to pgs in ffmpeg?

[08:40:55] <furq> auto wrapping is just going to end up with lines with one word before an \n in the srt
[08:41:14] <furq> or a <br> or whatever srt does
[08:41:48] <furq> i guess in either case the result will be that the user fixes their bad subtitles
[08:44:24] <kepstin> anyways, an ass renderer so you can properly typeset the subs would be better :/
[08:44:51] <furq> i've been watching a lot of subbed videos lately where the subtitler just puts line breaks and subtitle breaks in completely random spots in a sentence so i'm especially annoyed by it right now
[08:44:52] <kepstin> it looks like there are a few around that I found, but both that I found are basically untouched for the last 10 years :/
[08:45:13] <furq> it's really unpleasant to read
[08:52:06] <kepstin> pgs encoding seems like something that's pretty tricky too, it's a palette-based image format and frames have a maximum size of 64K after rle encoding, apparently.
[08:52:58] <AMM> Oh, I didn't know about the size limit, shame
[08:53:15] <furq> are you likely to hit that with a couple of lines of text
[08:53:22] <kepstin> (and from following some anime blu-ray engineers on twitter, apparently a lot of blu-ray players can't do frame-accurate switching between subtitle images, so you get flickers if you try to e.g. have top and bottom subs updating separately)
[08:53:33] <AMM> No, but a limit is a limit
[08:53:34] <furq> i guess if you're trying to fancy positional subs
[08:53:44] <AMM> 64k even with paletted rle is not a horrendous amount
[08:53:49] <furq> it's a bluray format of course there's a dumb limit
[08:54:23] <kepstin> if you ever wonder why anime blu-rays have weird timing when multiple subs are on screen, that's why - they're trying to work around flicker issues in players :(
[08:54:33] <furq> i have never wondered that for two reasons

I was wondering if I just $ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -metadata date=2004 -c copy output.mp4   will it remove all other metadata? In other words, do I have to specify them again?

[17:13:30] <cc0> hi, i'm trying to play an endless stream from MPEG TS files. i don't know in advance what files i'll play, so i can't create a playlist from the start. instead, i've tried doing  `ffmpeg -re -stream_loop -1 -i next.ts ...` and replacing next.ts when i want to loop another file, but it seems like ffmpeg doesnt try to reopen `next.ts`, as if it's caching the fd or something. is there a way to tell ffmpeg to actually re-open next.ts?

[20:05:29] <hyrcanus> due to the way modern codecs work, the video resolution isn't really the primary determinant of filesize
[20:06:12] <hyrcanus> if your goal is to reduce filesize, you'll get best visual results by using the same resolution as your preferred output device, but lowering the bitrate of the encoder
[20:06:47] <hyrcanus> and consider using a HEVC encoder like vp9 or h265

[20:27:13] <hyrcanus> at that bitrate audio will mangle music, but speech is fine for me

[20:28:25] <hyrcanus> if the input video is noisy i'll often crush temporal noise with  hqdn3d filter
[20:29:06] <hyrcanus> if the audio is too quiet, i use a custom compressor curve i made with the compand filter
[20:29:43] <hyrcanus> and since some of my playback devices are cpu only, i use -tune fastdecode.  this allows most devices to play my x265 without hwdec

[21:08:58] <Kingsy> exactly where I am :D
[21:10:00] <JEEB> libx264 and libx265 have different behavior and values, but the way you do things is very similar in case you care more about quality and compression
[21:10:31] <JEEB> first, you just do tests with different presets with a few minutes of representative content. the quality doesn't matter, but figuring out which is the slowest preset that is "fast enough" for you
[21:10:32] <Kingsy> so what I have is CODEC: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC
[21:10:50] <Kingsy> I am not sure what specifically I am looking for as "factors"
[21:11:04] <Kingsy> hmm so I don't have a sample of this video
[21:11:08] <JEEB> AVC/H.264 one is the ISO name and the other is ITU-T :P
[21:11:24] *** Quits: jrofd (~crombie@185.217.117.179) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[21:11:24] <JEEB> also generally speaking, heavily compressed content is not worthy of recompression
[21:11:36] <JEEB> you are just going to lose quality and possibly not gain much compression while at it
[21:11:44] <Kingsy> happy to loose quality.
[21:11:54] <Kingsy> 8GB is huge. I need it down to like 3GB :D
[21:12:06] <JEEB> huge depends on other parameters
[21:12:10] <Kingsy> haha I kniow
[21:12:11] <BtbN> 8GB for what resolution and duration?
[21:12:16] <Kingsy> I mean huge in my thoughts
[21:12:17] <JEEB> such as what BtbN noted
[21:12:26] <Kingsy> 1080p, 1 h 39 min
[21:12:27] <JEEB> anyways, going back what I was noting
[21:12:33] <JEEB> first figure out the slowest preset that is fast enough for you
[21:12:39] <Kingsy> 1 920 pixels / 1 032 pixels
[21:12:40] <JEEB> then adjust crf
[21:12:48] <JEEB> x264 starts at 23, x265 at 28
[21:12:58] <Kingsy> JEEB: I have no idea what that means.
[21:12:59] <JEEB> if it looks good/too large -> go up
[21:13:04] *** Quits: admal (~admal@gateway/tor-sasl/admal) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:13:06] <JEEB> if it looks bad/too small -> go down
[21:13:28] <JEEB> that is why you iterate over a few minutes of representative content so you can get the general feeling quickly
[21:13:32] *** Joins: admal (~admal@gateway/tor-sasl/admal)
[21:13:37] <JEEB> -ss SEEK_POINT and then -t DURATION is a good way
[21:14:01] <JEEB> so for example if your test point is at 30 seconds in and 240 sec long, -ss 30 -t 240
[21:15:06] <Kingsy> could you guys p[otentially give me some ffmpeg copmmands I could start with?
[21:15:15] <Kingsy> difficult getting started is right...
[21:15:15] <Kingsy> :D
[21:15:22] <JEEB> also a question, what are you planning to play this on :P
[21:15:46] <Kingsy> a media server. specifically jellyfin
[21:15:55] <JEEB> ok, so you most likely want compatibility.
[21:16:02] <Kingsy> yes please.
[21:16:09] <hyrcanus> jeep giving good advice here Kingsy - consider copying it to your notes
[21:16:16] <JEEB> thus H.264 via libx264 is probably a good choice
[21:16:23] <JEEB> your video is already in that format
[21:16:29] <Kingsy> h265 also works I think
[21:16:32] <Kingsy> perfect.
[21:16:35] <Kingsy> happy with that.
[21:16:48] <Kingsy> hyrcanus: haha at the moment its a bit abstract. I am not sure how to interpret
[21:16:51] *** Quits: hendursa1 (~weechat@user/hendursaga) (Quit: hendursa1)
[21:17:12] <hyrcanus> they are words to live by when you have learned more context and meaning
[21:17:33] <JEEB> HEVC/H.265 is just slower to encode in general (via libx265 etc), and while it might be useful in very low bit rate scenarios, if that's not exactly what you're aiming I would not recommend it
[21:17:50] <Kingsy> alright! this is fine.
[21:17:58] <JEEB> but sure, if you think HEVC/H.265 works then you may check how slow it is
[21:18:09] <JEEB> if you are going to be compressing a lot it may come in handy
[21:18:14] <Kingsy> how do you know its h264 from what I pasted?
[21:18:14] <JEEB> since it helps with blurring
[21:18:20] <JEEB> AVC is H.264
[21:18:26] <Kingsy> ok good to know
[21:18:37] <JEEB> AVC is the name used by ISO, H.264 is then the name given by ITU-T
[21:18:44] <JEEB> usually ITU-T names appear after ISO names
[21:18:52] <JEEB> since ITU-T only assigns numbers after it has been finalized
[21:19:00] <JEEB> while ISO format names stay
[21:19:06] <JEEB> throughout the development phase

[21:20:47] <JEEB> I would grab a build from Btbn's github in that case
[21:20:49] <Kingsy> is that what you were asking?
[21:20:52] <JEEB> yes
[21:20:57] <Kingsy> how come? this no good?
[21:21:01] <JEEB> https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
[21:21:08] <JEEB> btbn has set up automated builds
[21:21:18] <JEEB> master / non-shared is what you want if you are just about running ffmpeg.c
[21:21:44] <JEEB> Kingsy: 4.3 is quite old, older than even 4.4 which includes my rework of passing color metadata :P
[21:21:50] <Kingsy> ermm to someone new to this. are you saying I should clone and build from souyrce? I don't see a deb int he release there.
[21:22:02] <JEEB> you can download the linux 64bit tarball

[21:27:13] <JEEB> play with a player and pick a spot in seconds what would be representative of the content
[21:27:22] <JEEB> so that you can then encode a few minutes of it as testing
[21:27:31] <JEEB> since you don't want to encode the whole thing
[21:28:25] <Kingsy> alright. well its open in vlc. lets say a 30 second segment from 4:30seconds in? if thats what you mean?
[21:28:40] <JEEB> for example, usually it's good to at least have like 90 seconds or so
[21:28:45] <Kingsy> alright.
[21:28:49] <JEEB> but as long as you know the seek point that's the main thing
[21:29:07] <Kingsy> but I don't know how to cut it out. yoku can do that with ffmpeg on the bgi file? as you mentioned with those flags?

[21:29:36] <JEEB> I was going to give an example for the first bit which is to figure out how much time you are ready to dedicate for it
[21:29:44] <JEEB> just tried to get you to figure out your seek point first
[21:29:50] <Kingsy> when you say seek point.. how do I find that from vlc? or are you just talking about 300 seconds or something?
[21:30:10] <JEEB> the point to seek to to start the process, in other words your start location
[21:30:20] <JEEB> from which you want the duration to be calculated

[21:30:53] <JEEB> btw how many audio streams do you have in that thing :P
[21:30:58] <Kingsy> lets see
[21:31:05] <Kingsy> just one
[21:31:07] <JEEB> ok

[21:32:18] <Kingsy> so lets say my seek point (starting point) for the sample is 300 seconds. and I want it sample 90 seconds.
[21:32:19] <JEEB> so that's an example
[21:32:32] <Kingsy> ok let me try and understand this.
[21:32:39] <JEEB> where the SEEK_POINT is noted, that's where you put your 300 seconds
[21:32:48] <JEEB> -t is the wanted duration
[21:32:54] <JEEB> which I happened to guesstimate
[21:33:06] <JEEB> the preset and crf are x265 defaults
[21:33:26] <Kingsy> arnt we using 264?
[21:33:29] <JEEB> you first adjust the preset to figure out the slowest preset you are still OK with
[21:33:46] <JEEB> since you might have wanted to compress a lot and you said it'd support that too, I'll give you a taste of how slow it is :P
[21:33:59] <Kingsy> haha it'll be really slow :D
[21:34:14] <JEEB> not really really slow, just slower than x264
[21:34:27] <JEEB> but that's why 90 seconds
[21:34:31] <Kingsy> hrm -> Unrecognized option 'verbose'.
[21:34:31] <JEEB> you can tweak the preset

[21:35:38] <JEEB> not really
[21:35:43] <Kingsy> oh really?
[21:35:45] <JEEB> ASICs are good at low latency and speed
[21:35:46] <kepstin> nah, it wouldn't, that's a software encoder
[21:35:47] <JEEB> not compression
[21:35:53] <Kingsy> oh ok
[21:35:58] <Kingsy> jeeeeez I have alot to learn
[21:36:16] <Kingsy> I actually can't believe how good this software is.. its mind boggling
[21:36:29] <kepstin> if speed was important - for example you're doing realtime transcoding for a client that couldn't otherwise play some media - then a hardware encoder might make sense.
[21:36:42] <Kingsy> ahy es
[21:36:44] <Kingsy> ah yes**

[21:36:54] <Kingsy> jellyfin supports transcoding which is what you are talking about I think

[21:37:44] <JEEB> what ffmpeg.c is doing there for you is that, too
[21:37:44] <Kingsy> oh ok
[21:38:11] <Kingsy> ahh for some reason I thought that meant JIT as it was requested.
[21:38:13] <Kingsy> ok its done.
[21:38:48] <Kingsy> well I mean... the quality is flawless on that sample. lets see what media info says
[21:39:06] *** Joins: admal (~admal@gateway/tor-sasl/admal)
[21:39:13] <JEEB> alright, and since you are now in mode for speed testing first, decide whether you want to put more or less time into the compression :P
[21:39:16] <Kingsy> did we actually change anything there? or is that just a sample of the original?
[21:39:35] <Kingsy> I am happy to put more time into it. time isnt a factor for me really.
[21:39:38] <JEEB> you decoded some frames from the source, fed them through an encoder, and then copied the audio

[21:39:51] <Kingsy> ah ok got you.
[21:39:57] <JEEB> take a look at veryslow and then (probably) come back complaining
[21:40:01] <Kingsy> so no real "processing"
[21:40:37] <Kingsy> ok running -preset veryslow
[21:40:43] <Kingsy> is that what you meant?
[21:40:47] <JEEB> yes
[21:40:51] <JEEB> let me link you the list
[21:40:55] <Kingsy> cheers
[21:41:02] <JEEB> I have an idea of how to list those from FFmpeg's API
[21:41:06] <JEEB> but I haven't posted that yet
[21:41:11] <JEEB> so it isn't included in your build :)
[21:41:25] <Kingsy> so I have a question.
[21:41:30] <Kingsy> this -preset veryslow.
[21:41:56] <Kingsy> are we actually modifying the video here? lets say I run this on the entire file rather than a sample. would I end up with a "smaller" more compressed output?
[21:42:27] <JEEB> the overall compression ratio depends on the complexity of the overall video
[21:42:33] <JEEB> different bits are of different complexity
[21:42:38] <Kingsy> ah yes I have read about this.
[21:43:09] <JEEB> CRF is nice since it lets you more or less decide on the quality level, which is the inverse of trying to fit the video into a very specific file size
[21:43:27] <JEEB> https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git/src/8003e43825ee83b8ef346c8c3562c508ab23f117/source/x265.h#lines-2060
[21:43:34] <JEEB> there's the presets for x265

[21:44:03] <Kingsy> haha wow!
[21:44:21] <Kingsy> ok going to stop this. its a little too slow.
[21:44:42] <Kingsy> I suppose my question before was relating to, if I am going for a reduction in size.
[21:44:55] <Kingsy> how do I know how much I have effected the size of the full video?
[21:45:14] <JEEB> well first you pick the pain level (speed preset), and then you start adjusting the CRF value
[21:45:15] <Kingsy> should I set the preset to ultrafast, check the size then change it to slow and see how it changes?
[21:45:20] <JEEB> CRF value depends on the preset
[21:45:21] <Kingsy> oh ok got you.
[21:45:35] *** Quits: white5moke (~white5mok@ip72-219-109-30.oc.oc.cox.net) (Quit: Leaving...)
[21:45:36] <JEEB> I mean, the result of the CRF value depends on the preset (or well, parameters in general)
[21:45:43] <JEEB> how the encoder "sees" the video
[21:45:45] <Kingsy> can we just try medium? that seemed reasonable
[21:45:53] <JEEB> it's up to you
[21:45:56] <Kingsy> lets do it
[21:46:04] <JEEB> I'm btw not sure how much better x265 medium is vs x264 veryslow
[21:46:07] <Kingsy> what exactly is the preset giving me? more compression?
[21:46:28] *** Joins: rpthms (~rpthms@user/rpthms)
[21:46:29] <JEEB> basically for the same quantization range, how much time and effort the encoder is utilizing to be effective
[21:46:38] <JEEB> how well it "sees" it etc
[21:46:48] <Kingsy> oh I think I understand.
[21:46:57] <JEEB> anyways, check out libx264, preset veryslow and crf 23 (its default)
[21:47:05] <JEEB> just to compare :P
[21:47:38] <Kingsy> much faster!!
[21:47:47] <Kingsy> 10fps
[21:48:44] <JEEB> if you want to get a fair comparison, you probably want to attempt to match that resulting speed with x265 with some preset, and then start adjusting CRF upwards until you see issues
[21:48:53] <JEEB> then do the same with x264
[21:48:59] <Kingsy> oK!
[21:49:05] <Kingsy> can I start with x264 then perhaps
[21:49:07] <JEEB> at that point you have figured the first CRF value for both which looks bad
[21:49:08] <Kingsy> then I will switch and see
[21:49:18] <JEEB> and then you can compare the resulting size
[21:49:27] <Kingsy> I'll start creating different sample files as ai go so I can compare sizes of the samples and how they look
[21:49:32] <Kingsy> this is so interesting!
[21:49:38] <Kingsy> JEEB: thanks so much for taking some time.
[21:49:58] <JEEB> basically you get to figure out whether x265 makes any sense for you at the speed levels you'd like to have
[21:50:13] <Kingsy> yeah I think I understand.
[21:50:37] <JEEB> since you can literally can go lulzy fast with x264 at this point, and it has pretty well managed presets
[21:50:51] <JEEB> while x265's presets seem to be really geared towards attempting to make it feel faster
[21:51:08] <JEEB> buut that's just my general feeling :P
[21:51:10] <Kingsy> hehe so can I start with a x264 preset medium? to just get a feel for it? how do I start adjusting CRF?
[21:51:16] <Kingsy> gonna look at your command again
[21:51:41] <JEEB> if veryslow is fast enough, just stick around there?
[21:51:49] <Kingsy> ok!
[21:51:50] <JEEB> and attempt to then make x265 that fast
[21:52:04] <Kingsy> oh ok!
[21:52:14] <JEEB> CRF adjustment is basic, adjust upwards until both look similarly bad
[21:52:15] <Kingsy> so lets go 264 verslow
[21:52:29] <Kingsy> justy waiting for the first sample to finish
[21:52:33] <JEEB> 28 just happens to be the default with x265, and 23 for x264 (they are after all different encoders)
[21:52:33] *** Joins: ss4 (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot)
[21:52:39] <Kingsy> its running at 0.2x so its taking a bit for 90 seconds.
[21:53:02] <Kingsy> the filesize is already larger than 265 on medium mind!!
[21:53:15] <JEEB> well that doesn't say much until you match them on quality
[21:53:22] <Kingsy> true!
[21:53:27] <JEEB> since the CRFs are completely different
[21:53:35] <JEEB> as in, what they end up meaning
[21:54:04] <Kingsy> this is all madness! magic! :D
[21:54:49] <JEEB> or if you know that a certain CRF range for a specific encoder is going to look kinda bad, then just running encodes until the resulting file size (at the same speeds) pretty much matches
[21:55:00] <JEEB> that way both are bad and you get to look at which is less bad
[21:55:33] <JEEB> (since if you aim your tests at too high bit rate, you just won't see any difference :D)
[21:56:38] <Kingsy> I am kinda getting you./
[21:56:57] <JEEB> but yea, that's the gist of encoding when you don't really care about exact file sizes to be hit.
[21:57:02] <Kingsy> just waiting for this run to finish then I'll have a 265 at medium and a 264 at veryslow. see the difference.
[21:57:23] <Kingsy> what I want.. and all I'll ever want is the samller the better without a MASSIVE drop in quality.
[21:57:25] <JEEB> adjust preset to be as slow as is still fast enough for you
[21:57:27] <Kingsy> I mean 720p is fine
[21:57:32] <Kingsy> but like you say
[21:57:32] <JEEB> and then adjust CRF
[21:57:35] <Kingsy> that doesnt matter too much?
[21:57:56] <JEEB> well of course if you start wanting to go lower, downscaling is an effective means of doing that as well
[21:58:04] <JEEB> but I thought you'd want to try without scaling firs
[21:58:05] <JEEB> *first
[21:58:14] <Kingsy> I do, sorry yes I do
[21:58:21] <Kingsy> just getting ahead of myself.
[21:59:30] <Kingsy> I wouyld say the 265 looks better at 28 CRF and its smaller.
[22:00:56] <Kingsy> right going to play with the crf now.
[22:01:14] <JEEB> ok, basic comparison of things. is the keyint similar, and then is the "better" mostly due to possible artifacts getting blurred?
[22:01:30] <JEEB> x264 tries really hard to keep details by default while x265 is by default much more blur-happy
[22:01:41] <Kingsy> yeah i saw that!
[22:01:46] <Kingsy> what do you mean by keyint?
[22:02:12] <Kingsy> the 265 did seem more "flat" less artifacts (white dots) so the black seemed "blacker"
[22:03:41] <Kingsy> ok CRF 36 filesize decreased from 22.1MB to 18.3 for the sample
[22:04:10] <Kingsy> I would say its noticably worse quality.
[22:04:37] <Kingsy> noticable artifacts and things, like big blocks of pixels
[22:05:38] <Kingsy> which is a bit of a shame. I was hoping for a much bigger file decrease in size before that happened.

[22:07:09] <JEEB> keyint is the GOP length (how many frames max until random access point), both encoders should log what value they utilized
[22:07:21] <JEEB> -g GOP_LENGTH is how you set it to match if they differ
[22:08:10] <JEEB> for more blurring with x264 you can adjust the deblock parameter
[22:08:27] <JEEB> or just utilize one of the tunes that do it more by default
[22:08:43] <Kingsy> so what would you do in my case now? lets say I was happy with 265, if the CRF isnt giving me much filesize reduction before the quality is damaged.
[22:09:49] <JEEB> well if you are happy with the speed level and the CRF is adjusted then you remove the -ss and -t
[22:09:54] <JEEB> and then it will encode the whole shebang
[22:10:31] <Kingsy> but if the sample only decreased in size by 2 MB or so. doesnt that make it pointless for my goal? I want to literally quarter the size. :D
[22:10:42] <Kingsy> so wouldnt the aim be to get a 20MB clip to 5MB ?
[22:10:47] <Kingsy> then do the full shebang?
[22:10:59] <JEEB> how did you figure out the original size of the clip
[22:11:15] <Kingsy> oh...
[22:11:18] <Kingsy> shit I didnt..
[22:11:24] <Kingsy> Ih ave just had a brain fart.
[22:11:37] <Kingsy> RIGHT. lets try it then. I'll adjust the CRF a bit more.
[22:12:45] <Kingsy> is it possible to see the settings that were used ont he original file? or is it best to just encode and see how it compares?
[22:12:48] <Kingsy> just curious
[22:12:54] <JEEB> doesn't make sense
[22:12:59] <Kingsy> ok
[22:13:02] <JEEB> you don't have the input that was utilized
[22:13:10] <JEEB> since you only have the already compressed output
[22:13:15] <JEEB> which is thus your input
[22:14:25] <Kingsy> JEEB: just curious.. how do I downscale to 720p if I wanted to?
[22:14:29] <Kingsy> is it easy?
[22:14:42] <JEEB> -vf scale=w=-2:h=720
[22:14:48] <JEEB> video filter
[22:14:49] *** Joins: Volgaar (~volgaar@40.34.6.93.rev.sfr.net)
[22:14:50] <JEEB> scale filter
[22:14:53] <Kingsy> jesus... so yes.
[22:14:55] <JEEB> width (w) to -2
[22:15:14] <JEEB> (basically automagically calculated plus divisible by two)
[22:15:17] <JEEB> and h=720
[22:15:29] <Kingsy> another question, how well does this command I have work across mp4 or mkv or other containers with 264 or 265 ?
[22:15:42] <JEEB> movflags of course is mp4-specific
[22:15:56] <JEEB> for matroska you just switch the output file name to have dot-mkv at the end
[22:16:21] <JEEB> self-help is available at `ffmpeg -h muxer=matroska` and `ffmpeg -muxers`
[22:16:33] <JEEB> muxers just lists them all
[22:16:52] <JEEB> then -h muxer=NAME is the way to get the specific AVOptions and other info for a specific muxer
[22:18:28] <Kingsy> suppose if I need to do this with a mp4 I might have more questions. se what happens with that I have

[22:20:09] <JEEB> Kingsy: uhh, you are already writing into mp4?
[22:20:26] <JEEB> I especially did that since esp. with H.264 that tends to have much higher compatibility with plastic toys
[22:20:27] <Kingsy> just realised, my input is .mkv, I changed the output to .mkv too
[22:20:36] <Kingsy> ermm what the hell.
[22:20:48] <JEEB> but it's just the container, and both of those should work
[22:21:11] <Kingsy> JEEB: how come after adding -vf scale=w=-2:h=720, my speed when up to 1.06x. MUCH faster!
[22:21:35] <JEEB> how surprising, less pixels means less to code
[22:21:44] <Kingsy> hahaha!!! never figured.
[22:21:56] <JEEB> do note that usually lower resolution requires lower CRF values since the artifacts become larger (as you scale them back to full screen)
[22:22:17] <Kingsy> yeah I think I need to scale it back up.
[22:25:46] <Kingsy> right, going to let this run on the full thing. see how it turns out!
[22:25:48] <Kingsy> so much fun!
[22:26:00] <Kingsy> JEEB: cant thank you enough for that and the detail you gave!
[22:26:50] <durandal_1707> $$$$$$$$$
[22:27:02] <JEEB> modern encoders are quite nice in general, actually usable. you have preset and crf and that's what you generally need. you have the knobs to tweak if you really need to, but you don't *have* *to* utilize them

[22:49:13] <Kingsy> JEEB: in the encoding world.. what is meant by adding filters?
[22:49:30] <Kingsy> the way people speak of them it seems to help with compression so smaller sizes but better quality.
[22:50:34] <Kingsy> for example someone mentioned a denoise filter, or a hqdn3d filter, whatever that is.
[22:50:49] <durandal_1707> -vf ruin_the_pixels_with_filters
[22:52:48] <JEEB> Kingsy: well yes, if you pre-blur or remove grains/noise etc from a video it generally becomes more simple to compress
[22:52:55] <JEEB> *simpler
[22:53:04] <JEEB> I don't think there
[22:53:08] <JEEB> is much magic with that
[22:53:54] <Kingsy> how do you introduce such filters with ffmpeg? I want to stay away from handbrake.. is that a reasonable decision?
[22:54:01] <Kingsy> just to try them I mean
[22:54:03] <hyrcanus> durandal_1707 is right.  but for my archival of lectures to verysmall, temporal denoising is part of the toolkit
