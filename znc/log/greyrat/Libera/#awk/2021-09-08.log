[17:54:29] <Nintendo> What is the best way to truncate a file with redirection, ala "echo contents > file" in shell-speak?
[17:56:03] <Nintendo> Awk insists on appending contents, if the file has already been truncated once.
[17:59:39] <Nintendo> Should one simply call "close(file)" after every redirect?
[18:17:12] <yitz> What/why? You can use >
[18:51:33] <Nintendo> From the info page for gawk:  “Subsequent writes to the same OUTPUT-FILE do not erase OUTPUT-FILE, but append to it.  (This is different from how you use redirections in shell scripts.)”
[18:51:50] <Nintendo> !tias
[18:52:40] <nmz> awk does not have seek, so you have to close yes

[18:53:47] <Nintendo> Thank you.
[18:55:38] <nmz> even if you had seek, you would still be better off closing and reopening
[18:56:42] <nmz> that info page confuses me though, its not that different
[18:57:02] <nmz> in shell once you open the file with a redirection, you are forced to close and reopen it to truncate it
[18:57:10] <nmz> its not different*
[18:58:26] <Nintendo> The effect of > is different, though, as a shell will truncate the file every time.

[19:02:03] <nmz> I just woke up
[19:03:50] <Nintendo> Starting off the day right with IRC ;)
[19:09:28] <nmz> yeah, already started speaking nonsense

[20:08:03] <ash_worksi> what idiot thing am I confused about? I am printing a list using pg_restore -l that has, for example, FK in the 4th field; I know this because when I run '{print $4}' the number of lines that just say FK fill my screen; but for some reason `... | awk '$4 == FK'` just prints the first 7 lines which are just comments with a leading semicolon
[20:09:22] <ash_worksi> oh I needed to quote it
