[00:06:01] <ice9> anyone running Arch on Asus Zenbook UX435 or UX425?
[00:06:19] <grawity> tbh 1) ssh runs all commands through your shell, not even "interactive shell" ones (basically everything goes through /bin/bash -c)
[00:06:29] <earnestly> af: The manual talks about using the ${} notation for expanding environments in various keys; have you tried this?
[00:06:39] <grawity> and 2) arch compiles bash with -DNON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS, which means bash will read your ~/.bashrc [not profile though] even for non-interactive SSH

[00:22:21] <grawity> back when I thought python was slow, that was mainly because one of my main scripts had 'import Crypto.this.and.that'
[00:22:30] <grawity> importing stuff from Crypto calls gcc
[00:22:32] <af> grawity: Is there a magic flag to disable all this? I have a ton of python scripts and sure could benefit from them being a lil more snappy on slower machines

[03:32:55] <dylan_> Will ever i be notified if someone mentions me while im disconnected?
[03:32:55] <raster> so review the pkgbuild once, then from then on follow the git commit logs to that aur pkgbuild. that's my advice. look for commits (git log -U) and what they do since you last updated. it'll probably be simpler than re-auditing the whole pkgbuild every time.

[03:32:58] <heatwave> raster: but wouldnt such effort require reading and understanding various kinds of code?
[03:33:14] <heatwave> dylan_: can IRC even do that?
[03:33:17] <raster> well at a minimum you have to understand shell script and the pkgbuild.
[03:33:58] <dylan_> heatwave: there will be comments that indicates what changes, but an in depth understand would require some prior knowledge to a programming knowledge
[03:34:03] <heatwave> shell seems like a great tool to know anyways
[03:34:04] <raster> pkgbuilds generally tend to just take some upstream project (a release tarball of source, or maybe sometimes a binary release, sometimes a source tree from git, svn etc.) and then build it and package it.
[03:34:13] <dylan_> hestwave: no, i dont know, thats why im asking hahaa lol

[03:35:08] <raster> your first pass of checking is to see the pkgbuild doesnt sneak problems in. then ... if hyou verified it is actually packaging up the upstream release of whatever (be it a git tree master branch or a release tarball)... then as long as the pkgbuild is ok - you will have to figure out for yourself if you trust the upstream project as well.
[03:35:19] <heatwave> dylan_: I dont think IRC can establish a connection when disconnected. idk if it can hold messages and release them later on connection but probably not
[03:35:45] <Namarrgon> most PKGBUILDs are very formulaic, even bash newbies can spot irregularities
[03:36:00] <raster> in general ... as long as the pkgbuild is actually packaging what you expect it to - you can stop there as auditing an entire complex source tree of an upstream is not possible for 99.99999% of people
[03:36:05] <dylan_> heatwave: yeah sounds reasonable
[03:36:17] <eschwartz> heatwave, dylan_: there are some IRCv3 proposals for this
[03:36:39] <heatwave> raster: got it. So being generally aware of what's going on is important? I guess there's a big astricks to Linux being secure. Not as a bad thing, but you need to understand the system before getting too deep into arch 
[03:36:42] <eschwartz> but honestly, 99% of the time you don't need to be notified if you're not sticking around in the channel

[03:38:15] <eschwartz> and it would presumably be stored per account too...
[03:38:43] <eschwartz> you can basically do this already if you set up a bouncer e.g. ZNC
[03:38:44] <raster> reality is ... if an upstream wants to sneak stuff into their source tree... they can. a clever upstream can do it with even very smart and educated devs who know all the languages involved not knowing because they can hide things amongst seemingly innocuous changes. so again - you are pretty much down to trusting the upstreams or learning the skills and spending the time to audit the upstream. in my case i both package 
[03:38:44] <raster> and maintain aur pkgbuilds and am an upstream too... and i know i clould never audit the code i work on because it'd take me decades to do it because its too big.

[03:39:44] <eschwartz> raster: true, but generally when it comes to upstream projects you establish a trust relationship :D
[03:40:31] <eschwartz> then the devs could go to the dark side, but you have some confidence they won't, and if they do they lose their reputation so it's a bit of a one-trick pony
[03:40:36] <raster> eschwartz: exactly. thats my point. :) while you CAN audit and an upsgtream that does oss is not trying to hide things, they show openness and allow such audits to happen... it's not about the audit but about building that trust relationship.
[03:40:52] <heatwave> raster: I see. I think I would generally trust a stanger using Linux more than just a stranger without, but such people are also the most dangerous when they go rogue...

[03:43:41] *** Joins: aulonsal (~aulonsal@94.198.43.61)
[03:43:53] <raster> so all of this boils down to ... check your pkgbuild once - check it isnt doing anything bad and is using the upstream you expect. at that point - decide if you trust the aur packager ... if you do - then just git log and see if they are the only ones modifying the pkgbuild. if so - then you can be relatively sure it's probably ok (but again - you never know...). you also then need to decide for yourself if the upstream 
[03:43:54] <raster> source for the pkgbuild is also something you trust. make your mind up and then do what you feel is right. :)
[03:44:45] <heatwave> Are most aurs maintainers developing these apps too?
[03:45:21] <heatwave> or I guess mintainers track the actual app and repack that for aur?
[03:45:22] <raster> no
[03:45:39] <eschwartz> heatwave: if it's for an AUR package it should follow the filesystem hierarchy standard

[03:49:27] <raster> but ~/.local tends to mirror what might happen in /usr/local for "system installed stuff" ... if installed from source without special options. when software is instaleld form source without special options to move the prefix, the convention is that it installs in /usr/local (eg binaries in /usr/local/bin, data files in /usr/local/share/nameofproject, libraries in /usr/local/lib etc.)

[03:51:41] <raster> packages - be they core arch or aur (and this includes debian/ubuntu, redhat/suse rpm's and most distros) set the prefix to be /usr ... so binaries are in /usr/bin, libs in /usr/lib  etc. ... files in /lib and /bin historically were the core os which was quite minimal that wss provided by the unix vendor and these dirs would have what was necessary to boot and function minimally but then everything else was in /usr ... 
[03:51:41] <raster> read up on the history of the unix filesystem :)
[03:51:53] <heatwave> Got it. Currently looking at what makepkg -sri flags do first :) There's a bit to learn but seems worth the time
[03:53:33] <raster> a lot of this will make more sense once you learn the history. the unix fs (and today the FHS that linux has) is a result of decades of evolution. it has odd weird things in it that if i were to start again, i would never do, but it makes sense given the history. the faxct it has managed to survive this long and slowly evolve and somehow remain somewhat sane and usable is quite a feat.

[06:37:39] <archwizard> Alright so, I've had an arch install that I've kept around for several years now, and I'm looking to do a fresh install in the next few weeks. Currently, I'm using Xorg, Pulseaudio, and bspwm. I've been looking at Pipewire and Wayland. Are those stable enough to be used in an install? Also, I have an Optimus laptop, and I heard that Wayland doesn't support NVIDIA at all (much less optimus). Has that changed? In addition, are there any other
[06:37:39] <archwizard> new technologies I should adopt to keep up with the times? (I've been thinking about using doas to replace sudo). Thanks all

[11:18:39] <archwizard> I don't think so. DM-Crypt will overwrite the data that's already on the disk. Theoretically, you could take an image of your install on an external disk, then encrypt your disks, then restore the image onto the encrypted device, but that might be more trouble than it's worth.
[11:18:39] <archwizard> > how risky is it to fuck around with removing the gtk greeter and such after already having installed it
[11:18:39] <archwizard> Probably not super risky, since you can almost always escape to a console login using the CTRL-ALT-F2, or whatever the equivalent is for you

[11:56:09] <Ghosthree3> very fun

[12:01:31] <Ghosthree3> i have neither set up on this particular machine though i have used and like nftables
[12:01:57] <Ghosthree3> i have no problem with docker needing rules to work (because networking requires forwards or w.e), thats fine. but it changed the default chain rule lmao
[12:02:05] <Lartza> Yeah I do use nftables but it does not break anything in my nftables
[12:02:16] <Lartza> I don't remember if I have https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nftables#Working_with_Docker applied or not
[12:02:31] <Ghosthree3> its fine if it wants to add its own rules (preferably to nftables instead of iptables though) but why change the default policy
[12:02:47] <Lartza> It can only do that with iptables-nft

[12:12:43] <Amnesia> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Libvirt#Server however states: "Warning: The previous versions of this guide encouraged installing ebtables AUR package, but the iptables-nft package provides ebtables functionality without the need to rely on the AUR.

[17:02:14] <ice99> how this flag works while connected to the AC "/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold", so if the value is >= '80', it will run from the AC or from the battery until it reach 80?

[17:04:08] <Shapeshifter> ice99: I don't know but the only thing that makes sense to me is that it WONT charge the battery if the charge is above 80. This is a battery-longevity-enhancing measure because it avoides multiple short charging cycles above a certain threshold.
[17:04:27] <Shapeshifter> If the charge is below 80, it will charge until full

[18:09:23] <Shapeshifter> I thought so. But this place seems a lot more quiet than usual.
[18:09:44] <NetSysFire> as always, it depends. it can be pretty busy at certain times in the day
[18:11:30] <elibrokeit> Huh... Quassel claims only 598 people in the channel, pretty sure we had 3 times that last night.

[21:55:14] <thurstylark> Un1Gfn: gotta fit it in small spaces that bootloaders can get to 
[21:55:17] <thebombzen> but is it enough better to be worth it? I know in some cases its' not
[21:55:29] <MacGyver> You're literally asking "What's a good default". Arch recently switched defaults. It's not as though we're stuck with tech from the 80s. The default is a good sane default. If you have particular concerns for your usecase, that's not about defaults anymore.
[21:55:44] <MacGyver> So yeah, the answer to the question "What's a good default" is literally going to be "the default".
[21:55:55] <MacGyver> Ask other questions if you want different answers.
[21:56:51] <thebombzen> a very large number of times the default is not a sane default so forgive me for asking for a technical explanation
[21:56:55] <MacGyver> The initcpio is around 60MiB on a bad day. The decompression speed difference between LZ4 and zstd is not going to be noticeable.
[21:56:56] <thebombzen> and being told "default good"
[21:56:59] <MacGyver> As I said earlier.
[21:57:08] <Namarrgon> it's good enough that you don't need to worry
[21:57:24] <thurstylark> don't be daft, you're not accepting the answers you're being given
[21:57:26] <MacGyver> We've already spent more time arguing this than you'll ever gain by switching to a faster decompression.
[21:57:27] <Namarrgon> if you have specific requirements then you can still worry about it but you said that you don't care

[23:19:13] <cdrp> if anyone is using Unity, MATE, or Cinnamon, together with GNOME keyring (maybe for Visual Studio Code), and they have not configured anything related to the keyring manually, can you do echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK and say if it points to GNOME keyring or if it is unset (blank)?
