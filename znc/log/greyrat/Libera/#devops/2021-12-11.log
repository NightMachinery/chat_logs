[00:05:24] <slaughter> Skateboard before bike before car and all that 
[00:19:30] <Latrina> rawtaz, nothing in particular. I always wanted to see scandinevia 
[00:19:40] <Latrina> I would go all around it if I had the money and the time
[00:19:52] <Latrina> I also want to see Sweden
[00:22:26] <Latrina> I am in the process of figuring out a ansible playbook for a @world update
[00:30:05] <lantech19446> guys how do you push office to your users? Is everyone using O365 now? I can't do a silent install of office2016 to save my life they only publish it in exe so it can't be deployed by gpo and the OCT makes it an msp file so it has to be installed before that can even be used
[00:51:30] <lantech19446> :(
[00:51:51] <rawtaz> isnt office 2016 out of support entirely since a while?
[00:52:03] <rawtaz> and yes, using o365
[00:52:13] <rawtaz> because while more expensive simpler
[00:52:18] <lantech19446> 2016 is supported til 2023
[00:52:52] <rawtaz> hum
[00:53:31] <rawtaz> according to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-office-2016 it ended last year, unless you have extended support of course
[00:54:10] *** Quits: nexgen (~nexgen@li614-178.members.linode.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:54:28] <lantech19446> oh that's because it gave me the results for server 2016 not office
[00:54:44] *** Joins: nexgen (~nexgen@li614-178.members.linode.com)
[00:54:57] <lantech19446> still get tons of updates for it though so maybe the vlsc versions came with extra support
[00:55:18] <rawtaz> who knows
[00:55:40] <lantech19446> but even if i upgrade none of the new ones are coming with msi installers so i'm still going to have to figure this out
[00:55:47] <rawtaz> we moved to o365 not because we need the newest versions of office, but because the idiots at microsoft stops supporting the versions too early.
[00:55:59] <rawtaz> shor thang
[00:57:20] <lantech19446> we have O365 for the staff but it's E2 and you don't get the local apps with it
[01:00:01] <lantech19446> sometimes this shit is just so infuriating, why would they stop giving msi files but still require gpo to use only msi files like wtf
[01:00:36] <rawtaz> :/
[01:02:56] <lantech19446> I was really really hoping someone here would have an answer i've been hitting my head against this wall for 3 days
[01:04:06] <rawtaz> im sorry. i can give you an answer but the only thing you know for sure is that it wont lead to you the solution :P
[01:04:17] <rawtaz> i dont dabble in windows deployments of that kind luckily :3
[01:04:30] <lantech19446> lol
[01:10:05] *** Quits: gh34 (~textual@cpe-184-58-181-106.wi.res.rr.com) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[01:12:52] <lantech19446> the other issue I can't seem to get rid of is two separate servers downloading the same damn update repeatedly 
[01:14:09] <rawtaz> i wonder where kwilczynski is
[01:14:13] <rawtaz> perhaps not feeling great
[01:17:45] <lantech19446> hope he's ok
[01:17:58] <lantech19446> I've had a migraine ever since I came in to work 
[01:19:11] <rawtaz> it's probably due to windows being used there :-)
[01:19:24] <rawtaz> dont worry, it will pass as soon as you get a real job :>
[01:20:49] <lantech19446> lol tell me about it
[01:21:06] <rawtaz> i wonder which costs more, windows licenses or the shrink
[01:21:30] <kubblai> log4shell we have a ton of old java shit at work
[01:28:23] <kwilczynski> I am having massive stomach pain today. Sponsored by the very medicine that keeps me alive.
[01:28:40] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: lantech19446: Hugs. :)
[01:28:41] <rawtaz> :(
[01:28:57] <kwilczynski> It keeps swapping - stomach or headaches.
[01:28:58] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:28:58] <rawtaz> is there nothing one can do to fix you permanently? :(
[01:29:06] <kwilczynski> No, not really.
[01:29:07] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: thank you and I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well
[01:29:42] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: and here the rest of us (at least me and my ego) are spending our days being annoyed by idiots, while at the moment we dont have a deadly decease +speling
[01:29:47] <kwilczynski> A lung transplant in some extreme cases - but then you have to keep taking medication for your body to stop rejecting foreign tissue :) Which is probably as bad as my IV pump and such.
[01:29:56] <lantech19446> rawtaz: because we're a non-profit i'm going with the shrink my server2019 licenses cost me less than one visit
[01:30:09] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: do you have a pump now daily?
[01:30:13] <kwilczynski> I do.
[01:30:15] <kwilczynski> 24/7
[01:30:21] <kwilczynski> I walk with it, sleep with it, etc.
[01:30:42] <lantech19446> an infusion pump or insulin pump?
[01:30:50] <rawtaz> can you link to an image of what it looks like (i dont mean you personally but the gear so to speak). if you dont mind. im trying to understand how it's working in general terms
[01:30:54] <kwilczynski> I have catheter running into my central artery that requires constant maintenance.
[01:31:09] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: It's very similar to people who have chemotherapy. 
[01:31:23] <rawtaz> it does something with the blood then i take it
[01:31:26] <lantech19446> damn man i'm sorry you gotta go through all that
[01:31:29] <rawtaz> i thought you had something for the breathing
[01:31:49] <rawtaz> yeah why do one of the least big idiots in this world have to suffer :P
[01:32:11] <kwilczynski> https://www.remodulin.com/pump-options/cadd-legacy/
[01:32:12] <rawtaz> its kind of always the good people that get shit like this. i know plenty. never the bad ones :(
[01:32:16] <kwilczynski> This is how it looks like.
[01:32:30] <kwilczynski> The picture of the lady there show more or less it's size.
[01:32:41] <kwilczynski> I have two of these for redundancy.
[01:32:48] <rawtaz> good good
[01:32:48] <kwilczynski> Since I can't stop taking the medication for longer than 30 min.
[01:32:58] <rawtaz> ok so it adds medicine in your blood.
[01:33:03] <rawtaz> to*
[01:33:16] <kwilczynski> (otherwise fainting or suffocation [asphyxia due to not enough oxygen in the blood stream])
[01:33:24] <kwilczynski> It does.
[01:33:29] <kwilczynski> I also make the medicine.
[01:33:35] <rawtaz> uh, how?
[01:33:39] <lantech19446> I don't think you have the thing I was thinking of them because they're usually like once a month infusions for UC
[01:33:45] <kwilczynski> Either 7 100  ml cartridges, or every day.
[01:33:51] <rawtaz> and, what does it actually do? i mean, i guess it doesnt add oxygen to the blood does it?
[01:34:04] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: That's complicated.
[01:34:13] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: The medicine acts on entire body.
[01:34:19] <lantech19446> is it infusing iron to bind with the oxygen?
[01:34:22] <rawtaz> yeah figure. you dont have to explain it if its not summarizable easily :)
[01:34:47] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: It forces tissue inside veins and arteries and other such tissues to expand forcefully.
[01:34:50] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: More or less put.
[01:35:00] <lantech19446> that sounds brutal
[01:35:03] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: This is what is inside: https://www.veletri.com/
[01:35:14] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: It has AMAZING number of side-effects.
[01:35:15] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:35:43] <kwilczynski> Plus, I look like I have run a mile - I am red all the time from the expanded capillary veins on my face.
[01:35:52] <kwilczynski> My muscles are often sore from it, etc.
[01:35:53] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:36:22] <lantech19446> and somehow you force yourself to get up every day and go to work instead of collecting disability like a sane person
[01:36:24] <kwilczynski> But the migraine headaches almost daily are what is the most annoying bit.
[01:36:38] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Because I have no choice.
[01:36:42] <lantech19446> I can empathize with you there I've had a migraine for the last 4hrs
[01:36:54] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: I tak 25,000 units or 2.5 ml / 100 ml, if you wish.
[01:37:07] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: silly question but why cant they make something that simply adds oxygen to the blood? wouldnt it attach to the blood cells properly or something?
[01:37:15] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: 1.5 ml Veletri vial costs $60
[01:37:24] <lantech19446> jesus
[01:37:27] <kwilczynski> I need these ever day.
[01:37:30] <kwilczynski> For rest of my life.
[01:37:48] <kwilczynski> 2x 0.5 + 1.5 - 2x $30 + $60.
[01:38:03] <lantech19446> there is one thing I wonder about this medication but I don't know if i want to ask it or not
[01:38:05] <kwilczynski> I already spent an equivalent of a very expensive car here in Poland on my treatment.
[01:38:32] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: It's not about oxygen - not directly.
[01:38:44] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: The PAH or Pulmonary Hypertension is a complex condition.
[01:38:54] <rawtaz> i thought it was the lungs that didnt take up oxygen, but okay its also beyond that
[01:39:03] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: In my case it's the "idiopathic" one. Meaning "without clear cause".
[01:39:04] <rawtaz> i will check wikipedia again
[01:39:16] <rawtaz> and, you mean its just something you imagine :-)
[01:39:48] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68NPE-ZGaoE
[01:39:59] <lantech19446> it sounds like this medicine would give you a 24/7 hardon which would be a pretty fucking frustrating side effect
[01:40:26] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Funny.
[01:40:46] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: I take most complex set of medication for it - since I have the most severe version.
[01:40:52] <lantech19446> i mean it's literally caused by capillaries expanding 
[01:40:57] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Aside of the IV, I take a whole plethora of pills.
[01:41:02] <lantech19446> :(
[01:41:03] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: One of which is Sildenafil - aka Viagra.
[01:41:15] <lantech19446> yea i was gonna say i know that name for some reason
[01:41:28] <kubblai> i read that viagra can reduce chances of alzheimer's by quite a high %
[01:41:42] <kwilczynski> It has some odd positive side effects.
[01:41:46] <kwilczynski> Interestingly.
[01:42:02] <lantech19446> I actually used to know the guy who found the doctors to make that they originally intended it to be a heart medicine it failed spectacularly to do what they wanted it to but had some weird side effects that were marketable and it saved the entire project
[01:43:08] <kwilczynski> So yeah.
[01:43:12] <kwilczynski> That's my life.
[01:43:23] <kwilczynski> I also tire easily. Can't walk fast or for long time.
[01:43:32] <kwilczynski> Running is often a no-no.
[01:44:03] <kwilczynski> This also is a constant reminder of how precious time is.
[01:44:10] <kubblai> i dunno if true but some guy claimed he left a blue pill on the side board and his 1 year old ate it and his wife was asking why when she was changing his nappy he had an erection
[01:44:17] <kwilczynski> Since I may be maybe 5 more years before it's game over.
[01:44:28] <kwilczynski> (there is no cure for PAH and it has 100% mortality)
[01:44:40] <kubblai> im sorry to hear that kwilczynski 
[01:44:45] <kwilczynski> No worries.
[01:45:02] <kwilczynski> kubblai: That is a funny and scary story, and such dosage could kill the little one.
[01:45:16] <kwilczynski> Like everything in medicine - too much of everything will kill you.
[01:45:31] <kubblai> anything in life eventually i guess
[01:45:40] <kwilczynski> Coffee.
[01:45:42] <kwilczynski> Not coffee.
[01:45:52] <kwilczynski> I deny believing  that in case of coffee :P
[01:45:54] <kwilczynski> :P
[01:45:56] <kubblai> ha
[01:45:57] <kwilczynski> (just being silly)
[01:46:18] <lantech19446> lol
[01:46:29] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: So, I try to work as SRE during the day, not a very good one, however.
[01:46:31] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: you have an amazing outlook on life given all the shit you deal with
[01:46:34] <kubblai> you sure you dont get red faced from furiously trying to get rid of the viagra effects :)
[01:46:48] <kwilczynski> Then I hope for some strength in the evening/over night to try to work on my hobby which is more fun.
[01:47:01] <kwilczynski> But I feel that I am constantly behind with everything :)
[01:47:05] <kubblai> whats your hobby kwilczynski ?
[01:47:31] <kwilczynski> kubblai: I am trying, and also failing, to help with PCI, VFIO and IOMMU development in the Linux kernel.
[01:48:07] <kwilczynski> https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/MAINTAINERS#L14697 and https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/MAINTAINERS#L14748 - that's me.
[01:48:16] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: focus on fewer things and do them well then :)
[01:48:18] <kubblai> oh thats cool, i'd love to do something like that but i really struggle with programming i can do some terraform but i get really blocked on logic
[01:49:48] <kubblai> you're famous kwilczynski :)
[01:50:00] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: If I could leave day work, then that could work :)
[01:50:08] <kwilczynski> kubblai: No, not really.
[01:50:09] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:50:13] <kwilczynski> Nobody cares.
[01:50:53] <kwilczynski> At the moment I am trying to find, why my desktop running 5.14.21 is so far and snappy.
[01:51:02] <kwilczynski> Compared to 5.15 release which is abyssal.
[01:51:10] <kubblai> i used to be a fedora ambassador, but i use macos these days i like tweaking but i got a bit fedup of fixing it all the time
[01:51:14] <kwilczynski> So been bisecting changes...
[01:51:27] <kwilczynski> kubblai: :)
[01:51:43] <kwilczynski> s/far/fast/
[01:51:44] <lantech19446> I use straight up rhel and it's as solid as a rock
[01:51:54] <kwilczynski> I never had any issues with Linux, no a major one.
[01:51:59] <kubblai> at the time i had an nvidia card not really rpmfusion's fault but it was frustrating
[01:52:12] <kwilczynski> macOS was, however, driving me crazy.
[01:52:19] <lantech19446> lol i hate apple
[01:52:31] <lantech19446> the only thing I hate as much as I hate apple is microsoft
[01:52:38] <kubblai> i have an m1 mini atm and its really responsive
[01:53:11] <kubblai> work gave me a mac too /shrug
[01:53:36] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:53:51] <kwilczynski> I applied for work at Apple.
[01:53:56] <kwilczynski> Using my @linux.com e-mail :)
[01:54:08] <kubblai> how did that work out ?
[01:54:09] <kwilczynski> Of course I was rejected swiftly :)
[01:54:22] <lantech19446> one of the reasons I'm really happy I found an interest in devops instead of webdev is because my dev environment can be on linux where I was stuck on windoze with webdev
[01:54:28] <kwilczynski> I had to create Apple account to be able to apply.
[01:54:30] <kubblai> they just redid their open sauce website
[01:54:32] <kwilczynski> I raised this as an issue.
[01:54:48] <kwilczynski> I suppose, not enough devotion and fanboism on my side :)
[01:55:45] <kubblai> probably. you go to an apple store and all the employees have apple watches and when you talk to them they gush about their setups and then you wonder on their wages htf do they afford it
[01:56:18] <kwilczynski> Corporate discount?
[01:56:19] <kwilczynski> No idea.
[01:56:33] <kwilczynski> I can't afford M1 and I suppose to be wealthy working in IT :)
[01:57:01] <kubblai> i bought the wife an m1 air when they came out, she was overjoyed
[01:57:15] <kwilczynski> Adopt me. :)
[01:57:21] <kubblai> shes pretty tech illiterate :)
[01:57:28] <kwilczynski> That's OK.
[01:57:34] <kwilczynski> I am Appe-resistant.
[01:57:48] <kwilczynski> What I would like instead of an M1 is some VR set and PC capable of driving it.
[01:57:53] <kwilczynski> So I can try Half-Life: Alyx
[01:57:54] <kwilczynski> :>
[01:58:23] <kwilczynski> I wish there was some PC rental business.
[01:58:24] <kubblai> im more interested in AR
[01:58:25] <kwilczynski> Hehe.
[02:00:12] <kubblai> kwilczynski: move to the uk, the devops wages here atm are mental. i was recently looking with a job, within 10 days i'd had 10 interviews and a few offers and some pending. im mid lvl devops engineer and was going for jobs ranging from £50k to 80k
[02:00:22] <kwilczynski> kubblai: I can't.
[02:00:35] <kubblai> because of the meds?
[02:00:39] <kwilczynski> kubblai: I lived in the UK over a decade, almost my entire young adult professional life.
[02:00:42] <kwilczynski> And then Brexit came.
[02:00:48] <kubblai> yeah fuck brexit
[02:00:57] <kwilczynski> And my wife (she's Japanese) got kicked out.
[02:00:59] <kubblai> cant you get a sponsor ?
[02:01:05] <kubblai> fuckers
[02:01:07] <kwilczynski> I got permanent residency, she got 14 days to leave the country.
[02:01:20] <kwilczynski> So we move to Germany at some point.
[02:01:28] <kwilczynski> (now in Poland, though, because of my health)
[02:01:50] <kubblai> im sorry man, we didnt all vote for that shitshow (my wife is also an immigrant)
[02:01:52] <kwilczynski> kubblai: HMRC owes me 5 grand for immigration layer cost :)
[02:02:20] <kwilczynski> (we battled them for 6 months in the court)
[02:02:30] <kwilczynski> kubblai: Well, a lot of good friends there.
[02:02:37] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:02:40] <kwilczynski> I miss UK.
[02:02:47] <kwilczynski> London was nice, Cambridge I really miss.
[02:02:53] <kwilczynski> And Devon. Exeter is nice.
[02:02:54] <kubblai> I live in manchester
[02:03:06] <kwilczynski> Only visited.
[02:03:26] <kwilczynski> kubblai: Funny enough.
[02:03:28] <kubblai> but as soon as i get my irish passport we're moving to europe. my wife has an italian passport
[02:03:39] <kwilczynski> kubblai: I get bombarded by companies from the UK seeking technology workers.
[02:03:47] <kwilczynski> kubblai: These days.
[02:03:52] <kwilczynski> I got one from Tesco recently :)
[02:04:01] <kwilczynski> Made me LOL
[02:04:49] <kwilczynski> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/MqueP13Z/Screenshot%20from%202021-12-10%2023-34-25.png
[02:05:20] <kubblai> its a shame you cant work remotely
[02:05:25] <lantech19446> we get those in america but they're usually spam
[02:05:32] <kwilczynski> I suppose, shortage of skills, or how they call it, must quite something there.
[02:05:36] <kubblai> surely they have a presence in poland where you could be paid from
[02:05:47] <kwilczynski> kubblai: Oh yes, they do have some people here.
[02:05:55] <kwilczynski> kubblai: But the pay is 60% less.
[02:05:58] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: dont they hire remotely?
[02:06:00] <kwilczynski> kubblai: I don't see why would anyone.
[02:06:13] <kwilczynski> They have legal entity here.
[02:06:18] <kwilczynski> Tesco has... had stores here.
[02:06:36] <kwilczynski> It's they they assume Poland is IT gulag and pay peanuts :)
[02:06:39] <kwilczynski> They really do.
[02:06:57] <kubblai> cant you just pretend you're in the uk, and put a meet background of rain and darkness for meetings?
[02:07:20] <kwilczynski> I thought of putting up picture of Boris.
[02:07:27] <kwilczynski> But given current sentiment that might be a bad idea.
[02:07:28] <kwilczynski> ;]
[02:07:43] <kubblai> heh everyone hates him rn
[02:07:59] <kwilczynski> Oh I love him.
[02:08:12] <kwilczynski> Never in the history of the UK a head of state was an actual clown.
[02:08:14] <kwilczynski> I suppose.
[02:08:31] <kwilczynski> The meeting where he was inviting people to Disney Land was golden.
[02:08:33] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:08:46] * kwilczynski is being sarcastic, of course.
[02:08:49] <kubblai> funnily i like the clown bit. i just cant stand the continued corruption and lying
[02:09:01] *** Quits: rpthms (~rpthms@user/rpthms) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:09:08] <kwilczynski> Yeah.
[02:09:23] <kubblai> i might have less money than the average tory but that doesnt make me stupid
[02:09:24] <kwilczynski> Two-face Boris, I suppose.
[02:09:35] <kwilczynski> Also, probably like everyone else in politics.
[02:09:47] <kubblai> i dont expect labour to be much better no
[02:09:50] <kwilczynski> kubblai: You know what the most fun was during our battle with HMRC? :)
