[04:34:22] <NGC3982> also, what bothers me is that it's not consistent. i fetch C:\Users from a windows computer and C:\Users\user_1 is 775 and C.\Users\user_2 is 700.
[04:34:24] <curdlesnoot> I'm basically suggesting to check that it's not simply (correctly) backing up existing files modes of 700 from the source.
[04:34:33] <curdlesnoot> before going any further.
[04:34:54] <NGC3982> that sounds plausible given what i just wrote

[04:35:31] <curdlesnoot> greatcoof: after that, unmount and remount the device at /home. if a login as an ordinary user works well, you can unmount one last time and delete the 'original' home data.

[04:51:17] <curdlesnoot> look at the surrounding context also, but it does look like you have issues with the disk. filesystem corruption, alone, wouldn't be sufficient for the block device to simply drop out as it did.

[04:53:04] <NGC3982> ok
[04:53:15] <NGC3982> i got a few "bad message" errors beforehand upon trying to rm files
[04:53:27] <NGC3982> but i thought that was a problem with urbackup and not the drive
[04:53:36] <NGC3982> i guess i should try to replace the cable first?
[04:53:40] <curdlesnoot> on the contrary, that's a major red flag.
[04:53:45] <NGC3982> oh dang
[04:53:59] <curdlesnoot> you really should study the logs closely befoe rushing into doing random things.
[04:54:34] <NGC3982> yes, indeed
[04:54:44] <NGC3982> it's no hurry i guess and i have it backed up externally

[04:55:14] <curdlesnoot> for example, the difference between a dodgy cable and a disk yielding unrecoverable read/write errors might be discernable by way of what was logged.

[04:56:35] <curdlesnoot> that said, if there's no identifiable filesystem now, it doesn't sound good at all.
[04:56:39] <Dagmar> Well, some drives I've noticed will just "give up" after enough errors and stop talking for many seconds
[04:57:04] <Dagmar> ...and probably the most evil problem I've had at home is what happens when I reuse the cables that came with a motherboard once they're a few years old.
[04:57:24] <Dagmar> If a SATA cable feels loose, chuck it.  They're cheap and not worth the hassle they cause if there's transient disconnects
[04:57:44] <NGC3982> i dont really understand why it's visible under /dev/sdg now?
[04:57:47] <curdlesnoot> absolutely. life is too short for that sort of uncertainty.
[04:58:06] <NGC3982> Dagmar: i see.
[04:58:13] <curdlesnoot> because it dropped out and then was re-detected for whatever reason. there's no rule that the kname has to be the same now.
[04:58:14] <Dagmar> NGC3982: because if it totally disconnects while stuff is using it the old device name can't be freed, so the kernel will just stick it on the next available one
[04:58:26] <NGC3982> ah, i see.
[04:58:35] <Dagmar> Another reason to mount by filesystem UUID rather than device name
[04:58:46] <Dagmar> ...although in this case, it's just extra horrifying

[05:17:35] <Davidian1024> i really only have one iptables rule at this point.  and it sort of works, which is really frustrating.
[05:17:39] <felco> usually you need two thing, ip_forward and iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s <localsubnet> -j MASQUERADE and it will work
[05:17:46] <curdlesnoot> NGC3982: you're already dealing with some defgree of ext4 filesystem corruption, likely as a side-effect. so a block-level device backup might be the sensible thing to try. the idea being you have a 'snapshot' of an ext4 filesystem elsewhere that you can then try to repair.

[07:37:14] <curdlesnoot> actually, there's no need for the 2>&3 part in that example, I think. stderr isn't going to be gobbled up by a command substitution to begin with.
[07:37:40] <curdlesnoot> so, rather, dup the 'original' stdout for use within.
[07:37:47] <neshpion> oh yeah `notify-send 'build done' "$({ time build_things &>/dev/tty; } 2>&1)"` works also

[09:36:22] <sheep> amd has a proprietary usermode stack, but there is an open source userspace stack for it
[09:36:41] <sheep> the kernel modules for both are the same and are open source except for some small firmware blobs

[09:37:33] <TomTheDragon> radv?
[09:37:35] <sheep> but they all use the same kernel drivers
[09:37:46] <sheep> it's an open source vulkan implementation for amdgpu

[09:38:08] <sheep> the kernel drivers are a massive amount of C code and some small firmware blobs

[13:34:50] <PaulFertser> (from your last link) And the SSD looks like a SATA one because it has the B key too.
[13:34:53] <curdlesnoot> although, I think that's an M.2 SATA drive shown by the teardown with a B+M key?

[13:36:34] <PaulFertser> curdlesnoot: yes, that's a bit confusing like that. SATA disks have both B and M, while normal M.2 motherboard connectors have only M. That way you can insert either SATA or x4 in them. If the MB connector had only B then an x4 disk which has only M cutout wouldn't fit.
[13:36:50] <curdlesnoot> PaulFertser: right, I see.
[13:36:55] <PaulFertser> no_gravity: I guess you missed reading this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2#Form_factors_and_keying

[13:37:59] <PaulFertser> curdlesnoot: now the question is what should a motherboard manufacturer do if they decided to support _only_ x4 and didn't route SATA to the connector. The answer is: use the same MB connector as usual, add a note to the docs.
[13:38:10] <curdlesnoot> well, even if the mention of a 2x limit be true, that's still a better option than SATA. at least, in principle.

[16:20:46] <Bossi> pasiz, if its COW makes it not easier to get the datablocks back, since the reference is gone at all
[16:20:46] <mxfm> Hi! I need some hint regarding kernel configuration (compile time). In early dmesg kernel prints "Linux version 5.13.0-1-mainline (linux-mainline@archlinux) (gcc (GCC) 11.1.0, GNU ld (GNU Binutils) ..." I can change the 'mainline' suffix but I don't see where 'archlinux' comes from.
[16:20:59] <hodapp> mleh, I gave up on vbox awhile ago and never regretted it
[16:21:03] <pasiz> btrfs contains restore method
[16:21:18] <Bossi> sure if the blocks are not reused meanwhile

[18:26:59] <Laurenceb> I'm writing my own socket implementation as a higher level on top of SocketCAN
[18:27:14] <Laurenceb> but I'm struggling with high latency when its under low load
[18:27:16] <simbaclaws> eah but I'm guessing it's opening some kind of socket in order for others to connect. perhaps it's opening too many sockets for a single connection or something weird
[18:27:18] <simbaclaws> I dunno
[18:27:43] <Laurenceb> the "connection sockets" only exist as a construct within my own code
[18:27:51] <simbaclaws> hmmm ok
[18:28:07] <Laurenceb> my code runs on top of SocketCAN which is a raw datagram Berkeley socket
[18:28:36] <Laurenceb> so my Sockets have ~250us lag at very high load, which is amazingly good
[18:28:51] <Laurenceb> but then at 1hz packet rate it goes to 20ms which is amazingly bad
[18:29:07] <Laurenceb> ironically stress testing improves the performance
[18:29:15] <simbaclaws> is there something like a FIN packet being send at the end for closing the sockets?
[18:29:20] <Laurenceb> yes
[18:29:48] <Laurenceb> but multiple "sockets" are open simultaneously
[18:30:07] <Laurenceb> it looks like socket timeout is responsible for my issues
[18:30:29] <Laurenceb> 		tv.tv_usec=SHORT_WAIT;
[18:30:29] <Laurenceb> 		if(queue_est>1) //if there is a queue of more than one outstanding transmission, it would be more efficient for us to wait a while for it, and try to compress two addresses into one frame
[18:30:30] <Laurenceb> 			tv.tv_usec+=LONGER_WAIT;
[18:30:30] <Laurenceb> 		setsockopt(cansock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &tv, sizeof(tv));
[18:30:45] <Laurenceb> I use variable timeout depending on how much data I expect in the next 400us
[18:31:07] *** Quits: kulak (~kulak@user/kulak) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[18:31:32] <simbaclaws> so when queue_est == 1 it will use the short wait?
[18:31:35] <simbaclaws> or less
[18:31:44] <Laurenceb> bu that code only works correctly at high load, at low load tv is.tv_usec is effectively rounded to the next jiffy
[18:31:47] <Laurenceb> yeah
[18:31:54] <famubu> Kyv: Looking at the help will reveal a lot I guess.. :-D  But my w3m's 'H' key has been changed to something else. That should be easy enough to figure out. Is mentioned in the manual.

[18:32:22] *** Joins: kulak (~kulak@user/kulak)
[18:32:39] <famubu> I mean got to be mentioned in the manual..
[18:32:56] <simbaclaws> have you debugged your queue_est to see how many sockets come trough? And have you checked what the current values of SHORT_WAIT and LONGER_WAIT will be by sending debug logs or something? Or maybe by stepping through the code?
[18:33:00] <Laurenceb> there might be a way to sidestep timeouts using peek and nowait flags to recvmsg
