[04:18:58] <Hassan01> anyone know of any crypto coins which have useful PoW?
[04:19:36] <Hassan01> I'm sure I'm not the first one to think of this lol
[04:21:53] <Victorsueca> Hassan01: Yeah, you're not the first one, technically bitcoin's PoW is useful as in it helps keep the bitcoin network safe. But I'm guessing you mean useful as in doing scientific work like calculating large array operations or simulating proteins.
[04:22:09] <Hassan01> yeah, something like that
[04:22:24] <Hassan01> I agree with the first part, bitcoin has inherent value in that it's not controlled by govt
[04:22:40] <Hassan01> but if we had useful PoW then all the naysayers would be silenced
[04:23:11] <plankster> in a way, the more useless the computations used to secure a blockchain, the more secure it will be

[04:25:24] <Hassan01> not sure what you mean by harder to hijack
[04:25:44] <Hassan01> you mean the chain is secure because there are asics?
[04:26:27] <Victorsueca> Hassan01: If you can profit from the PoW in a way other than the coins you are rewarded, that means that you could potentially mine the coin at zero cost to you
[04:28:00] <Hassan01> so.. what?
[04:28:03] <Victorsueca> for example, you sell the protein to a farmaceutical company, and the sale price covers the costs of the mining operation
[04:28:21] <Victorsueca> that would mean that mining the coin was entirely free
[04:28:45] <Hassan01> not sure if that's true, first of all you don't know how much the pharma company will pay
[04:29:00] <Hassan01> and if all of a sudden there's immense compute then the pharma will pay you very little
[04:29:06] <Hassan01> because of supply and demand
[04:30:00] *** Quits: yanmaani (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[04:31:42] <Hassan01> also the point of PoW isn't that it's expensive monetarily
[04:31:57] <Hassan01> it's that you're limited by your compute power
[04:32:23] <plankster> as in yeah its harder to acquire lots of sha256 asics or find them in large quantities
[04:33:00] <Victorsueca> Hassan01: What happens if the increase in compute doesn't happen or is not big enough? A huge company or government could setup a mining operation, pay it with public funds and call it "Pharmaceutical Research", get profits by selling the results to pharmaceutical companies and all while doing a "free" 51% attack on the coin.
[04:33:40] <plankster> or you could have an asic resistant algorithm like eth and watch gpu prices go silly
[04:34:21] <plankster> and watch everyone blame it on bitcoin!
[04:35:43] <Hassan01> Victorsueca then the chain will be compromised and it will lose all value
[04:36:05] <Hassan01> isn't that incentive enough?
[04:36:47] <Hassan01> or you could argue govts would want it to lose all value and after it does lose all value they can just use the compute for whatever they want
[04:36:48] <Victorsueca> Hassan01: not if that was your objective in the first place
[04:36:57] <Hassan01> but the same is true of any PoW
[04:37:18] <Victorsueca> Hassan01: except that for any normal PoW it is very expensive to do so
[04:37:29] <Hassan01> how much general purpose compute would you need to attack bitcoin atm?
[04:38:06] <Hassan01> what if the US govt seized all FAANG datacenters to attack bitcoin? pretty sure they could do it
[04:38:09] <Victorsueca> Hassan01: General purpose? More that anyone could manufacture in the next 10 years
[04:38:27] * plankster pats his bitcoiner miner
[04:38:58] <Hassan01> Victorsueca have you actually done the math and if so can you lay it out?
[04:40:03] <Victorsueca> Hassan01: No, it's just a guesstimate, sorry, but my guss is also that if my number is off, it's by short and not by long

[04:40:08] <Victorsueca> guess*
[04:40:47] <Victorsueca> The reason is because you asked for general purpose computing, but Bitcoin is generally mined with dsha256 ASICs
[04:41:41] <Hassan01> ok so from this : https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate we get a max of 180 TH/s

[23:38:51] <Victorsueca> ossifrage: The bitcoin core repo has a script to build bdb 4.8 automatically, just run "./contrib/install_db4.sh `pwd`" from the root of the repo. Alternatively you can also use --with-incompatible-bdb to use newer versions anyway, but that will break wallet compatibility with any build that uses bdb 4.8, which includes the released binaries.
