[01:33:06] <ningu> hi, I've noticed a somewhat odd behavior on this page: https://database.outofpapua.com/. while the page is loading, the radio buttons seem to "jump" slightly from right to left. occurs in both firefox and chrome. how can I diagnose what's causing it?
[01:34:03] <ningu> this site is written in svelte and maybe something there is causing it, but I don't know how to debug
[01:35:04] <ningu> it could just be a basic css thing too
[01:39:19] <hassoon> ningu: that's the time your webpage was taking for the css code to take effect
[01:39:28] <hassoon> ningu: aka page load
[01:43:01] <ningu> I suppose
[01:43:07] <ningu> but why does it not effect the rest of the page?
[01:43:38] <hassoon> ningu: the selectboxes are affected too
[01:44:03] <ningu> yeah, I guess that's true
[01:44:30] <ningu> I don't the select boxes affected in my browser actually except for locally in dev mode when it's not all pre-bundled
[01:45:25] <hassoon> ningu: you can make html transparent with opacity:0; as an inline rule, then once the page is fully loaded, using the window.load event, you can remove the previously-set opacity rule
[01:45:32] <ningu> is there some css that's applied earlier and some later?
[01:45:47] <ningu> for example why does the font change not flash?
[01:46:12] <ningu> ah yeah, I've heard of that opacity trick

[02:31:55] <FunkyBob> blah... in this app we have a bit of a mix of title= and using some react thingy that uses that to show a styled popup
[02:32:12] <AMcBain> Possibly, depending on the element. Images should use the alt attribute instead. https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/ is what MDN links to which is probably the same as showing an explicit tooltip.
[02:32:42] <AMcBain> I'd argue that the content of these things should probably be on-screen already anyway as labels for stuff or footnotes below items, etc. Whatever makes sense for the item.
[02:33:14] <AMcBain> There's also aria-label as well if you have something that's an icon but otherwise doesn't have text but should mean something other than "image #62" (like for navigation) but I still prefer to have text in there, just hidden in a way that's accessible.
[02:33:15] <FunkyBob> it's a <label> with text-overflow : ellipsis
[02:33:40] <AMcBain> and it can't be wrapped? :-/
[02:34:17] <AMcBain> That would be my preference for labels rather than cutting them off, but I also try not to make the label contents too long. Relevant commentary would go in a block below the input or whatever.

[04:05:47] <carlino3> hi!
[04:06:43] <carlino3> i have a layout similar to this: https://jsfiddle.net/xej5ncrz/3/
[04:07:27] <carlino3> i want the whole document to fill the visible area
[04:07:28] <carlino3> what is the best way to do this?
[04:08:27] <carlino3> the whole document should be always visible, it should never overflow
[04:09:59] <entuland> how can you make the whole document never overflow if there isn't enough room?
[04:10:04] <entuland> something has to give somewhere
[04:10:40] <carlino3> entuland i plan to handle that with media queries
[04:10:48] <carlino3> it should always be enough room for all the displayed elements
[04:11:23] <entuland> you can use a grid layout and force it to take all the available space to arrange the elements you have (with or without internal overflowing)
[04:11:27] <entuland> such as with this layout: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/1at5xzkh/
[04:11:43] <carlino3> entuland yes, that is exactly what i'm trying to do
[04:12:06] <entuland> good, make your body / main container always take all the available space and grid it away
[04:14:26] <carlino3> entuland what rule is making the container take all available space in your layout?
[04:14:28] <carlino3> position: fixed?
[04:14:47] <entuland> yep
[04:14:59] <entuland> fixed position with inset zero
[04:15:09] <carlino3> it seems like i also need inset
[04:15:15] <carlino3> never heard of that rule, reading about it
[04:15:17] <carlino3> thanks!

[14:12:48] <Auctus> FunkyBob: indeed; but do you know why the ::before and ::after elements arent behaving as the ones on the left?
[14:15:28] <FunkyBob> well, in the div based one the divs are display block, but oyu set  the before/after to inline-block
[14:15:36] <FunkyBob> however, settings them to display block makes them narrow
[14:18:24] <Auctus> when i set the pseudoelements to display:block, then the grid doesnt work properly, then the 3 elements are arranged vertically instead of horizontally, for some reason
[14:19:19] <FunkyBob> i'm guessing since they're pseudo elements they don't participate in t he grid
[14:19:30] <Auctus> when i set them to inline-block they dont expand; if i dont set them at all, they dont expand
[14:19:47] <Auctus> i think they should, and in firefox, the inspector, it does say they are grid elements
[14:20:11] <Auctus> and i thought i read in my travels that they should behave as grid elements, and saw other people said they were... but clearly i am no expert
[14:21:03] <Auctus> i mean, i can live with the multiple divs solution in markup, but ideally, id like to understand whats going on
[14:22:36] <Auctus> hmmm
[14:22:40] <Auctus> "One tricky thing is that no selector selects it other than the one you used to create it (or a similar selector that is literally a ::before or ::after that ends up in the same place)."
[14:22:51] <Auctus> found that at https://css-tricks.com/a-little-reminder-that-pseudo-elements-are-children-kinda/
[14:22:55] <Auctus> maybe thats related
[14:23:32] <Auctus> but then it goes on to say it definitely behaves like a grid item

[16:33:25] <FightingFalcon> i guess so
[16:34:15] <FightingFalcon> ok it worked now

[16:58:05] <FightingFalcon> entuland, what happens when you set the position relative?
[17:13:59] *** Joins: mikeputnam (~mikeputna@wilug/mikeputnam)
[17:17:03] <entuland> that you become able to move the element around relative to its original position _but_ the space it occupied in the flow will still remain occupied
[17:17:23] <entuland> as if the element was still there

[18:06:59] <FightingFalcon> just a simple question: https://www.bodytr.com/x/index.htm  please visit this. and take a look at the last 3 photos. i want the last photo to be blow 2nd last photo. so 1 image and next to it, two images below each other
[18:07:14] <FightingFalcon> whats the best way to achieve this? any other alternatives to flexbox?
[18:15:36] <entuland> stupid thing part N: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/3anqup2y/
[18:16:30] <entuland> uhm... not sure how much of that you can achieve with just CSS given arbitrary image sizes and ratios
[18:16:43] <entuland> there is a name for that kind of automatic arrangement IIRC
[18:16:57] <entuland> masonry perhaps?
[18:17:03] <FightingFalcon> wow, how did you do that??
[18:17:28] <entuland> each div is nested into the other div
[18:17:35] <entuland> by hovering I'm shifting and rotating them
[18:17:48] <entuland> each shift and rotation will affect all the descendants
[18:17:50] <FightingFalcon> i see
[18:20:34] <entuland> about your question: the easy way with manual work is to use a grid layout and explicitly set where you want everything to go, including spanning
[18:21:04] <entuland> if you don't know in advance the order and aspect ratio of the images, then you need some JS to take care of that most likely
[18:22:01] *** Quits: stkrdknmibalz (~test@rrcs-75-87-43-226.sw.biz.rr.com) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[18:22:12] <entuland> alternatively you can clip the images to force them into a specific aspect ratio and "round hole square peg" force them into your layout
[18:22:33] <entuland> about the masonry, this is what I was referring to: https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout/
[18:27:04] <FightingFalcon> ok thanks
[18:27:09] <entuland> yw
[18:28:14] <ecommence> packery is way better than masonry imho

[18:28:33] * ecommence just bought tons of amphetamine. time to finish all my websites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[18:28:44] <entuland> I'm not up to date with those layouts, last time I have investigated them was 10 years ago or so
[18:29:00] <ecommence> entuland: they're more like JS libraries actually
[18:29:03] <howdoi> amphetamine?
[18:29:13] <entuland> yep, I see
[18:29:21] <ecommence> entuland: really cool stuff though. the author is a genius
[18:29:24] <entuland> FightingFalcon may find that useful
[18:29:37] <ecommence> howdoi: at least i didnt say methamphetamine right?
[18:29:51] <ecommence> couple of adderals to get the juices flowing
[18:30:05] <entuland> meh, doesn't look like something one should advertise anyways
[18:30:17] <ecommence> well you dont know what you're talking about
[18:30:23] <howdoi> If we were to do a holy grail layout with only white background, how would we and the demarcations between the sections? (Shadows?)
[18:30:23] <ecommence> its a legal substance
[18:30:32] <ecommence> and it increases your productivity a thousand-fold
[18:30:51] <ecommence> you sound like a 5-year-old coming up to me saying "you shouldnt smoke. smoking is bad for you."
[18:30:59] <ecommence> btw, kid, its weed.
[18:31:01] *** Quits: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa) (Quit: Bye!)
[18:31:58] <entuland> howdoi, you may not need demarcations at all
[18:32:26] <entuland> e.g. just plain whitespace between paragraphs
[18:33:25] <howdoi> entuland: but they I need to get the white spaces right or else it looks odd, any example?
[18:33:41] <entuland> sure the spacing has to be consistent, one sec
[18:34:10] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/dyUvemP.png
[18:34:55] <entuland> it's just matter of leveraging on the "see shapes where there are none" thing
[18:35:20] <entuland> you can clearly tell the grid there and the regular spacing even though there are no demarcations
[18:36:12] <howdoi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/7AnP94dS/IMG-20210618-WA0012.jpg
[18:36:35] <howdoi> entuland: form something like ^
[18:36:59] <entuland> that looks like a good start, just adding proper padding inside of those areas should give you the necessary whitespace
[18:37:41] <howdoi> So the entire layout can be white just adding the right padding is all we need?
[18:38:08] <entuland> yes, that's the approach in the screenshot I've shown
[18:38:16] <entuland> there are no demarcations anywhere
[18:38:28] <howdoi> Okies, let me try
[18:38:35] <entuland> well, there are some exceptions in that website, but the vast majority is just white background
[18:39:19] <entuland> https://sardinias.co.uk/guide/costa-smeralda
[18:39:52] <entuland> some parts of that website seem broken, but the gist of it should still come across
[18:41:25] <howdoi> Hmm, is there any guide or article on whitespaces and grids?
[18:41:55] <entuland> the MDN documentation about the grid layout should give you all you need to create such a layout
[18:42:30] <entuland> there isn't really much more than the things used here: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/1at5xzkh/
[18:43:10] <entuland> I mean, for a layout like the one in your screenshot

[18:54:01] <entuland> the amount of whitespace between the various "boxes" really depends on how much content you have and tastes
[18:54:18] <entuland> that website above is very tight with minimal spacing
[19:05:10] *** Quits: mikeputnam (~mikeputna@wilug/mikeputnam) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[19:10:34] <howdoi> Agree, my aside has an image
[19:31:58] <ecommence> howdoi: Whitespace is actually the most fundamental and also trickiest part of design and architecture. You have to stay buried in books for years to know everything there is to know
[19:34:13] <howdoi> ecommence: for sure, it is pretty deep
[19:34:54] <howdoi> creating a mobile responsive holy grail layout with CSS grids is hard that I expected
[19:35:12] <ecommence> hmmm
[19:36:00] <ecommence> you could just say fuck it, you know
[19:36:05] <ecommence> and just use regular css :D
[19:36:25] <ecommence> i do all my stuff mobile only. lil' bit of flexbox here and there :D
[19:36:38] <ecommence> its 2021 who uses desktop anyway?
[19:37:30] <entuland> most of the times all you need to do on mobile (narrow portrait) is converting an horizontal menu into a drop down / slide in one and arrange all of your content in a single column
[19:37:36] <ecommence> hovers, clicks special treatment.no chance in hell desktop will still be around 10 years from now:D :D
[19:38:38] <entuland> you can create some additional breakpoints for certain widths (tablets) but it really boils down to how large your main grid elements are and how they look, and change the template according to that
[19:39:08] <entuland> you can also mix and match the two techniques together - grid for the main layout, flex inside some sections, or additional subgrids
[19:39:33] <ecommence> howdoi: you mean grids and all that stuff?idk man. imho theyre useless concepts that kill the creativity of our children and encourage bad design practices
[19:39:55] <entuland> one important technique to keep in mind is "display: contents;" to "remove" elements from the tree and let the parent grid arrange such children (say, stuff put in a list)
[19:41:35] <entuland> just enabling the mobile simulation and drag the width / height edges around to see how your page reflows is normally enough to decide where to break
[19:42:37] <howdoi> > imho theyre useless concepts that kill the creativity of our children and encourage bad design practices
[19:42:37] <howdoi> lol
[19:42:46] <ecommence> :D
[19:42:58] <howdoi> noted `display: contents;`
[19:51:01] <howdoi> Closest I came across https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/dance2die/blog.extending-tailwind-css-preflight-normalization-with-zero-padding/tree/master/?codemirror=1
[19:53:08] <entuland> you don't need all of that to achieve that rearranging
[19:56:19] <howdoi> Overkill with tailwind?
[19:56:32] <entuland> you just need breakpoints in CSS
[19:58:52] <entuland> resize to go under 600px width: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/1at5xzkh/2/
[20:00:11] <entuland> if you need the elements to go in a different position you just set their grid-column explicitly inside the @media query
[20:00:30] <entuland> s/grid-column/grid-row
[20:03:58] <entuland> mind you, that exact approach on mobile may be bad cause you would be better just letting the page grow vertically indefinitely depending on the context, I just altered the original fiddle to show how to rearrange the stuff
[20:06:40] <entuland> this would be better to convert that layout in particular: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/1at5xzkh/3/
