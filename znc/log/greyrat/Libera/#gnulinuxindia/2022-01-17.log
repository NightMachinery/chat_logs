[08:36:37] <AryaBackup[m]> so i barrier'd it to my laptop
[08:36:56] <NightFury[m]> I installed it using snap but it's not launching
[08:37:11] <NightFury[m]> AryaBackup[m]: lol
[08:38:30] <NightFury[m]> AryaBackup[m]: Any idea? Did this happened to you

[08:44:10] <AryaBackup[m]> noice
[08:44:18] <AryaBackup[m]> i need to replace proxmox with nix one day
[08:44:23] <AryaBackup[m]> just too lazy to do so
[08:44:52] <Vaibhav[m]> NightFury[m]: so just get it from pacman
[08:45:14] <NightFury[m]> Vaibhav[m]: yep
[08:45:34] <Vaibhav[m]> avoid using snap, it's bad
[08:48:42] <NightFury[m]> no I just searched if there is snap about it but mostly I used pacman
[08:50:04] <AryaBackup[m]> when there is an aur pkg why snap
[08:50:23] <AryaBackup[m]> no use for snap when you have the aurt
[08:55:33] <Aryan[m]> Just switched to arch few days back, didn't even bother to install snapd aur flatpak, AUR has everythingü•≤
[08:56:03] <AryaBackup[m]> Aryan[m]: yes
[08:56:17] <AryaBackup[m]> i dont have an opinion on snap/flatpak
[08:56:18] <AryaBackup[m]> its just 
[08:56:23] <AryaBackup[m]> use the f'ing aur lol
[08:56:31] <AryaBackup[m]> appimages are good though
[08:56:38] <AryaBackup[m]> but still aur > *universal
[08:56:47] <NightFury[m]> <AryaBackup[m]> "no use for snap when you have..." <- Ok then I pledge not to use snapüòÖI didn't know a lot disadvantages of using snap I sometimes used it as an alternative to make process more easier, I used it because I heard from YouTube that it's good
[08:57:00] <AryaBackup[m]> if only makepkg was cross platform
[08:57:03] <AryaBackup[m]> that would be amazing tbh
[08:57:15] <AryaBackup[m]> i probably can hack up something for that
[08:57:49] <AryaBackup[m]> no deps needed like nix its platform independent 
[08:57:59] <AryaBackup[m]> makepkg is a shell script thankfully
[08:58:35] <AryaBackup[m]> 1483 line shell script :P
[09:01:12] <smud[m]1> I use flatpak for proprietary applications because it runs them in a sandbox, and keeps all of them contained in a single place
[09:01:58] <AryaBackup[m]> everything non-free is in chromium (i use firefox for daily use)
[09:02:23] <Vaibhav[m]> <NightFury[m]> "Ok then I pledge not to use snap..." <- Snap apps performs terrible and not to forget that canonical is pushing it too much on Ubuntu users.
[09:02:23] <Vaibhav[m]> Flatpak can be a good option but still AUR > Anything

[09:05:31] <AryaBackup[m]> appimage with their new updater seems promising 
[09:06:28] <Vaibhav[m]> NightFury[m]: No, snaps are very slow to install and takes a lot of time too start and there ram usage is very terrible. They ignore system theming preferences and not to forget there snap store is a proprietary software
