[01:44:30] <Samian> is it possible to have variable intelligence? When I haven't taken my adderall, I'm dumb.   Typos all over my messages.  My typing speed is down the toilet and typing mistakes in every sentence.   When I code, there's a syntax error or logic error in 1 of ever 5 lines of code
[01:44:58] <Samian> I'll not "see" the answer when trying to solve a problem
[01:45:08] <Samian> I won't see the best move when playing chess
[01:45:14] <Samian> but when I take my adderall, all that changes
[01:46:20] *** Joins: aototot (~teteetett@92.114.82.82)
[01:46:59] <Samian> I go from dumb to smart, methodical, penetrating, concise, and precise.
[01:47:50] <Samian> What can I do to always be smart?
[01:48:00] <Samian> To never be the adhd idiot
[01:56:15] <plankers> well, i tend to look at most things as having a mechanism which will tend to return them to some neutral base state
[01:56:21] <plankers> brain chemistry being no different
[01:57:10] <plankers> so if you alter your brain chemistry with adderall, the compensatory mechanisms in your brain will overcompensate in the other direction, making you tired and dumb
[01:57:33] <plankers> this will even out over time if you stop taking the adderall, but otherwise theres not really a way to escape this reality
[01:58:03] <plankers> in short, you can climb to the top of the mountain, but no man can withstand the harsh conditions for long
[01:59:36] <plankers> you can of course modify the base state to be more or less focused/alert/smart or what have you
[02:00:02] <plankers> but that requires conscious effort and self-knowledge
[02:00:39] *** Quits: trbp (~trbp@user/trbp) ()
[02:00:41] <plankers> and at some point youll run into walls determined by the limitations of the self
[02:01:01] <plankers> and while i shared all of that as definitive fact, its just the way i look at it
[02:03:30] <plankers> to extend the mountain metaphor, altering the base state would be like moving base camp up or down the mountain. it requires a concerted effort and there are only a few eligible places to construct a safe and sturdy base camp
[02:04:00] <plankers> and the higher up you go, the fewer stable points youll find
[02:10:46] <tinwhiskers> it's also possible the adderall just makes you think you've become smarter but it's just an illusion
[02:14:34] <plankers> yeah or that
[02:16:35] <alix> yeah
[02:16:37] <alix> placebo effect
[02:16:51] <alix> you could be seeing adderall as a trigger to go into smart / high-effort mode
[02:17:09] <alix> and in fact you could have some degree of that with also some degree of actual improvement from the adderall
[02:17:11] <tinwhiskers> not necessarily placebo.  it may directly influence mood and perception
[02:17:15] <alix> i.e. doesn't have to be one or the other
[02:22:41] <plankers> adderall is a helluva drug tho. have taken it and spent 6 straight hours churning out a lab report
[02:23:02] <plankers> but its more of a focus thing than an actual intelligence thing
[02:23:11] <alix> a lot of intelligence is about focus
[02:23:28] <plankers> when i say inteligence i mean ability to synthesize new ideas
[02:24:09] <plankers> perhaps not the most comprehensive definition

[03:32:51] <Samian> tinwhiskers  it's not an illusion, at least with respect to typing speed. On typeracer.com, my WPM is consistently faster when adhd is in full effect in my system.
[03:33:02] <Samian> That's an objective fact.
[03:34:08] <biys> objective fact
[03:34:12] <tinwhiskers> no. It's not.
[03:34:18] <biys> i reject your reality and choose my own
[03:35:02] <tinwhiskers> state of mind can have a huge impact on performance. You may be performing better because you think you will (placebo effect as alix said).
[03:35:22] <tinwhiskers> you may well be right, but it's by no means an objective fact
[03:35:40] <Samian> I can't imagine a placebo having that kind of impact
[03:35:57] <tinwhiskers> well, now you know better
[03:36:16] <alix> it doesn't have to have all that impact
[03:36:28] <alix> why not a mix
[03:36:29] <Samian> dude my typing speed just hit 129 WPM.
[03:36:48] <Samian> when I'm not on adderall it's in the 80s
[03:37:01] <tinwhiskers> cool. it's likely it helps but not an objective fact...
[03:37:23] <tinwhiskers> being in ##philosophy you should know there is really no such thing as a truly objective fact
[03:39:03] <Samian> There is if you follow the consensus use of language which is that objective fact means information collected through sensory perception and assuming things are what our senses tell us they are.
[03:39:30] <Samian> tinwhiskers otherwise you can say we "know" nothing other than that we know we exist.
[03:39:41] <Samian> I know therefore I am
[03:39:53] <Samian> I think therefore I am
[03:40:52] <lalia> No true objective fact. A relatable standpoint and a classical one observable as far back as Diogenes Laërtius and Cicero.
[03:41:48] <biys> the objective fact is that there is no true objective facts?
[03:41:50] <biys> how does that work?
[03:42:04] *** Joins: atmoz (~atmoz@user/atmoz)
[03:43:00] <lalia> Formulating it like that is itself a language problem and also a misunderstanding of the terms with respect to this stance.
[03:43:03] *** Quits: Treefingers (~Glassbox@103.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:43:36] <lalia> It'd more more appropriate to think of it as a denial of the conditions necessary for establishing anything like an objective fact.
[03:44:26] <lalia> For this sort of stance the goal is normally some sufficiency condition met by factors like intersubjective agreement.
[03:45:08] <alix> i don't understand the notion
[03:45:38] <alix> how can there be no objective fact? there are things that we can measure and get the same results every time
[03:45:51] <alix> those things would exist and be in the state they're in without us there to perceive them
[03:45:58] <biys> agreement of axioms more than likely
[03:46:00] <alix> so is it not an objective fact that they exist?
[03:46:25] <biys> and likely the interpretation from person to person
[03:46:38] <lalia> Sure, I'm not trying to break it down real carefully either. This is quite the summary. You'd be able to find a better explanation in text than I'm gonna be able to take time to give ATM, sadly.
[03:46:51] <lalia> IEP or SEP are probably appropriate resources right about now. :)
[03:49:11] <Samian> alix  the skeptic's argument is basically that we don't know if we're in a virtual reality system.
[03:49:20] <lalia> This matches up with a few topics: academic skepticism is the most general. Contextualism in epistemology is another as well as flavors of what is sometimes called scientific skepticism.
[03:49:31] <lalia> There are good article for these topics on SEP, fer sher.
[03:49:55] <Samian> the argument goes: because we don't know if we're in a virtual reality system, we don't know if anything we see, hear, touch, taste etc really exists.
[03:50:20] <alix> Samian: so then if we're in a virtual reality system, then isn't that an objective fact?
[03:50:27] <alix> plus the existence of the virtual reality system within some wider universe
[03:50:50] <plankers> samian i think you would enjoy einsteins "in my later years"
[03:51:01] <plankers> he has an excellent discussion about how knowledge is derived from sensory input
[03:51:48] <lalia> That characterization of skepticism represents a strictly western philosophical camp emerging around the time of Descartes writing.
[03:52:10] <lalia> If you refer to the articles on SEP, you'll notice there's a more nuance to the tradition.
[03:52:21] <Samian> plankers  I already read many books on epistemology
[03:52:44] <plankers> thats just one of the essays. it covers a lot of ground
[03:53:40] <Samian> empistemology gettier problem, bertrand russell, tripartite theory of knowledge, occam's razor,  and more
[03:55:04] <plankers> but einstein takes a very rigorous approach, which i thought you might appreciate
[03:55:21] <plankers> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[03:55:43] <lalia> I chimed in to agree with tinwhiskers and to highlight how the stance connects to others in the history of philosophy. :P
[03:55:52] <lalia> Take care gang. o/

[05:35:13] <spruit11> heh well whatever.  no,  I don't any 'matrix' comparison because that's either not deep in classical western thoughts on our relation with reality and at the same time something all Americans seems to get wrong about for example Baudrillard.
[05:36:46] <spruit11> take Baudrillard's hyperreality.  he doesn't state that we live in a matrix,  he states that people rather live in that reality they perceive as more real than reality.
[05:37:07] <spruit11> it's the exact opposite of 'matrix'
[05:37:29] <spruit11> something like 'reality' is still there,  but we prefer not to see it anymore
[05:38:04] <spruit11> something he was right on and at the same time explains phenomena like the tea party or the 'alt-right'
[05:39:03] <spruit11> in short: we have been shifting into cuckoo land since the invention of mass media and social media and stuff has only made that worse
[05:42:35] <spruit11> addendum on more real that reality: the hyperreal was derived from mass media advertisements.  take a woman,  a woman in an advertisement seem to be more 'real' to our sensen,  way more attractive or obedient or whatever,  that we rather believe that portrayal of a woman than what usually confronts us in life
[05:43:28] <spruit11> so,  no.  not 'matrix' but the exact opposite.  the 'real' is still somewhere out there,  we just don't want or need it anymore

[05:59:29] <plankers> using big words to make yourself feel smart, mostly
[06:09:36] <lalia> In the context of philosophical pursuits, an aversion to big words or complicated concepts is generally indicative of a discussion participant who isn't earnestly engaging the relevant topic or issue.
[06:10:25] <lalia> As such it's normally a good idea to cut yer losses if you find yourself chatting with such a person and you're sincerely invested in whatever the talk is about.

[06:33:54] <spruit11> part of it in post-modern work is actively trying to construct an image which reflects reality in another light than you could with ordinary language
[06:35:02] <plankers> do you have any examples?
[06:35:29] <spruit11> that actually has a long history.  even Hegel is to some extent mostly a word game expert who with different techniques 'negating the negation' tries to arrive at a deeper understanding of the mess
[06:35:41] <plankers> do you mean like the kind of stuff burroughs attempts?
[06:36:05] <spruit11> probably everything by at least Deleuze or Derrida.  Spivak maybe.  Dunno.
[06:36:18] <spruit11> It takes me effort to read stuff like that too.
[06:36:39] <plankers> its certainly taking the masturbation to another level
[06:36:58] <spruit11> it was an experiment which served a purpose
[06:37:24] <spruit11> made a lot more sense in the 60s.  especially with the weed and LSD going around
[06:37:42] <plankers> right, it made me think of burrough's cut-up technique
[06:37:46] <spruit11> people don't have the mindset for it anymore.  I don't think it still translates
[06:37:54] <DivFlux> What doesn't make sense about it?
[06:37:55] <lalia> I've kept all kinds of company... some are the sort of people being described where who will pontificate using unnecessarily complex language in order to inject some sort of style into their expressions. There are others who make use of technical language as a means for conveying complex thoughts concisely which seems like a question of efficient communicaiton rahter than pretense to me.

[06:47:40] <michigan> its hard for me to read, i have to really concentrate
[06:48:04] <spruit11> ah.  still more geared towards Baudrillard.  although I have two major thought on him.  a) somewhere we always did this though in essence he's right and b) fuck yeah,  if the hyperreal is better let's go there
[06:48:13] <michigan> "geometric distance"
[06:48:19] <michigan> "our capacity to be exposed to them in unison"
[06:48:26] <michigan> come on man!
[06:48:32] <lalia> spruit11: BTW, I liked your breakdown of Baudrillard's hyperreal. That's how I rembember it breaking down too at any rate. :)
[06:48:49] <DivFlux> michigan: Our ability to communicate on mass scale because of internet technologies means that distance matters less.

[06:50:40] <michigan> DivFlux I'm so proud of you
[06:50:52] <michigan> You know you're taking all of my advice
[06:51:06] <DivFlux> Well I can't promise consistency.
[06:51:13] <michigan> You've done everything I've asked of you
[06:51:23] <michigan> And you never ever questioned twice
[06:51:33] <michigan> Thank you for doing what I told you do
[06:51:43] <DivFlux> You asked about specific phrases and I presented what I thought of them, but now if I say the shorter phrase next time, you'll  know what I mean
[06:51:44] <michigan> * to
[06:51:45] <michigan> Your achievements are also mine
[06:51:55] <michigan> My padawan, you make your sensei proud

[06:52:55] <lalia> I avoid getting into complex topics here these days because I'm rarely willing to use simple terms in the context of philosophical discussion unless I'm in a classroom enviroment. I'm often lacking the patience for it.
[06:53:12] <michigan> lalia: that's a very good point
[06:53:32] <michigan> i remember this short poem:
[06:54:22] <michigan> "My love, I apologize if my letter is a bit too long. I didn't have time to write it any shorter."
[06:55:06] <lucky> DivFlux: Yes, I have recently struggled with that perspectie shift.
[06:56:50] <DivFlux> I imagine the Pony Express like a network and realized it would have to take all kinds of meandering routes due to geography. Now we just beam over it all.
[06:57:40] <lucky> Not even so much the rapidity, as the volume and reliability and uniformity worldwide (more or less)
[06:58:01] <lucky> tho there is that short-term emotional angle with social media
[06:58:16] <lucky> I can research... any contemporary topic in absolute depth without going anywhere.
[06:58:31] <michigan> DivFlux: just so you know i stole those lyrics from Key & Peele - My Best Friend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvdMLE6Tmvc

[06:59:04] <lucky> I'm the last generation that will remember physical flip-card registry files and libraries with millions of books.  hm.
[06:59:09] <DivFlux> lucky: I see, yeah, it's easy to have "the take." I've been trying to get away from it.
[06:59:36] <lucky> Which of course was the pinnacle of accessibility and scale of information for 20th century civilization, freaky in its own right
[06:59:55] <lucky> too many words not enough time to read it all
[07:00:06] <DivFlux> Slow rate of metabolism :p
[07:00:08] <lalia> Apologies, I'm not able to follow along closely. I'll bob back in when I'm not distracted with kiddo stuff.
[07:00:26] <DivFlux> We gather so much but we can't really consume it (incorporate it) effectively with the institutions we presently have
[07:01:47] <michigan> lalia is too good for us.
[07:01:49] <michigan> ok bye lalia!
[07:02:08] <lucky> (:
[07:02:44] <DivFlux> lucky: I'm nearing 40, the first 40% of my life was more or less analog, and I came of age during the rise of social media and all that.
[07:03:28] <lucky> half decade younger than you
[07:03:45] <DivFlux> So fairly close timeline for you then too
[07:05:34] <DivFlux> So like, in "olden times" you have a strong emotional reaction to some kind of event, by the time you can convert that into a medium of communication, it's dimmed a lot.
[07:05:42] <DivFlux> It doesn't carry
[07:05:52] <lucky> yes, that changed quite a lot in the last 150 years
[07:06:20] <lucky> your immediate reaction to an event would be known to a handful of people, and could only be distributed by going thru multiple people to editorialize/check/caution on it
[07:06:29] <michigan> we're getting old guys
[07:06:46] <lucky> "oh the humanity" an early exception, notable precisely for being what it is, an immediate slice of human reaction to a horrible thing
[07:06:54] <DivFlux> lucky: Also as a result, the kind of events that come about can be made to invoke emotional responses.
[07:06:55] <lucky> we now drown in that by the petabyte daily
[07:07:17] <DivFlux> In an immediate manner
[07:07:19] <michigan> maybe its time to start planning how to preserve our DNA so future humans can resurrect us
[07:07:30] <DivFlux> I think one thing is the "instant feedback" that happens now with social media
[07:07:37] <DivFlux> That is missing from mass media
[07:07:38] <lucky> I hope to clone my dog one day.

[07:09:18] <lucky> done very carefully it could be stored near-indefinitely in the right environment I suppose
[07:09:44] <lucky> just write it on a microchip.  if they can clone humans they can read that.
[07:09:44] <DivFlux> Well I wasn't born to propagate my DNA so I don't see much use in preserving it, hah.

[07:11:15] <lucky> If a bunch of people pooled their funds, it would probably be 'relatively' affordable to encode your genome and launch it into deep space.  I'm unsure if this is a wise thing to do or not.
[07:11:18] <lucky> What if someone finds it?
[07:11:34] <michigan> hehe
[07:11:36] <DivFlux> I don't think it'd matter much, they'd know little about the conditions you were made for
[07:11:56] <DivFlux> So they clone a bunch of infants that suffer horribly a short time in some hostile alien environment
[07:12:00] <lucky> There are several companies looking to do that (launch stuff into interstellar space, Golden Record style) now with spaceflight costs coming down so much
[07:12:02] <DivFlux> If they can even get them to develop
[07:12:04] <lucky> curious notion
[07:12:20] <michigan> i had that idea too actually
[07:13:03] <michigan> according to bob lazar, the best place to send our DNA to would be the zeta reticuli starsystem

[07:13:45] <michigan> my neighbor did it, she now has a beautiful boy
[07:14:06] <spruit11> Chomsky is big on being against mostly French posturing.  But I think he's wrong.  I even think a lot of scientific progress is due to 'posturing'.  Like the weird idea that something in itself carries along with it it's contradiction.  That somewhere states 'I see a phenomenon,  lets see what it could be if it's exactly the opposite of what I think it is.'  When all people think like that,  like in the 18th/19th century,  I
[07:14:06] <spruit11> think you can attribute scientific progress to that.
[07:14:19] <lucky> DivFlux: approximately that happens in that pulp as one plot.  it's so bad it's good tho?
[07:16:43] <DivFlux> lucky: I like the angle of no conflict = slower military development. It goes in nicely with my Virilio readings :p
[07:17:13] <DivFlux> One of his arguments is about science merging with tech and advancing  along those lines due to military needs.
[07:18:25] <michigan> if you can produce artificial gravity, no military in the world will be able to touch you
[07:19:36] <amigojapan> michigan: producing artificial gravity only requires centrifugal force
[07:20:34] <lucky> spruit11: I see what is, let's say useful framework, or even a theory (in the good ol' modern sense) in it, but it's a huge leap of faith to... take it particularly seriously?
[07:21:04] <michigan> amigojapan: yeah or large quantities of mass
[07:21:13] <lucky> seriously in the sense of ... hm.  see... interpretations of quantum mechanics.
[07:21:57] <amigojapan> Yup michigan
[07:22:06] <spruit11> yah sure.  I don't think philosophy and the exact sciences have that much to tell to each other
[07:22:54] <michigan> but with a device that can produce it on its own, you'd be able to bend space and time
[07:22:56] <DivFlux> That seems like a sad state of affairs.
[07:23:10] <lucky> some seem to think that some very human areas are exact sciences
[07:23:13] <michigan> bend light
[07:24:01] <spruit11> maybe philosophy as a vehicle to have STEM researchers think through sociological implications
[07:24:01] <michigan> SpaceX's rockets would instantly become obsolete
[07:24:37] <DivFlux> spruit11: Why the separation?
[07:24:40] <michigan> advanced propulsion
[07:25:19] <spruit11> because of the limits of language.  but yeah,  you're right
[07:25:58] <michigan> but real artificial gravity would require technology we just dont have today
[07:26:21] <lucky> spruit11: there is a fascinating history of ideas angle to it all, I have recently put a lot of emphasis on I guess a materialist view.  More people, more food, larger labour surplus, technologies relating to writing and communication being moved forward by more traditional craftsmanship and technique as well as proto-chemistry, etc.
[07:26:24] <michigan> its like taking a nuclear reactor and sending it back to victorian times
[07:26:33] <michigan> scientists at the time would have no idea what it is
[07:26:38] <lucky> not sure which drives what there, thought or form :)
[07:26:45] <michigan> they'd start tinkering with it but immediately drop dead

[10:33:01] <lucky> i'm glad for you, it took me a long time to figur out how to eat right for me
[10:33:04] <lucky> maybe still not there
[10:33:55] <amigojapan> lucky: yeah. But I find the keto diet easy cause I don't go hungry like with callory diets

[12:50:52] <arryana> i don't like to mow before 10 am, but that'll happen soon
[12:52:14] <arryana> it was evidently driving the fellow next door nuts watching me trim the hedges by hand (which was intentional), so he walked over with his electric clippers and went to town on them
[12:52:46] <arryana> his intent was appreciated, anyway.  nice fellow
[12:56:18] <arryana> theoretically today i'd like to get as far as mowing the front and back, and powerwashing the driveway and patio
[12:56:24] <arryana> but that might be overly ambitious
[13:13:56] <pussipupu> berries are an easy win though
[13:14:19] <pussipupu> doesn't take much to clear for them and fills the garden with promise

[18:43:12] <biys> hahaha.  his post reads exactly like what i said when this all started happening
[18:43:34] <biys> tbh tho.  something is rotten in the state of denmark
[18:43:53] <biys> i still can't decide on which side, personally
[18:45:13] <brigand> biys: did you read how they bought libera.net and redirected it to freenode.net?
[18:45:46] <biys> no.  that action in itself is void of context to me though
[18:45:55] *** bosspotato_ is now known as bosspotato
[18:46:04] <biys> there were two users in here about two days ago that were discussint eh integrity of foos
[18:46:23] <biys> i think it was positioned that as a result of the code being open source it's subject to scrutiny
[18:46:28] <brigand> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27797806
[18:46:28] <ro-bot-o> [url] Freenode is pointing irc.libera.net to chat.freenode.net | Hacker News | news.ycombinator.com
[18:46:41] <biys> or the potenital for it to be subject is significantly higher than w/ closed source software (this is obvious)
[18:47:14] <biys> i'd like to wonder to what extent potentially subversive entities haven't contributed though
[18:48:47] <biys> brigand: has anyone taken credit for the action?
[18:50:28] <brigand> you doubt freenode is responsible?
[18:54:26] <biys> it is a possibility
[18:55:21] <biys> it's been suggested for years that freenode glows so hard you  might as well set up solar panels around it

[19:07:43] <brigand> oh, right
[19:07:51] <audrey> new owner of ##politics on libera gave me ops for reasons I don't understand because we do not get along
[19:08:12] <audrey> I tried moderating for a little bit but realised the place was every bit as disgusting as it used to be on freenode
[19:08:20] <brigand> they maybe thought "better than kunwon" xD
[19:08:50] <audrey> Heh. Very probably.
[19:09:11] <arryana> you're a good choice.  i can see it.
[19:11:49] <biys> problem with the model is i don't really wan my chats moderated for me
[19:12:06] <biys> i have methods built into my clients so i can limit the spam i see
[19:12:17] <biys> the thing about it is that people just love to be outraged though
[19:12:22] <biys> and publically display their outrage
[19:12:35] <biys> then have someone, a moderator in this instance, pander to their sense of being
[19:12:50] <biys> it's instant gratification almost
[19:13:48] <audrey> the problem with ops in ##politics is that they usually let their personal political biases dictate whom they ban
[19:14:08] <audrey> so e.g. if you're a complete troll and asshole but the viewpoints which you superficially espouse are those which the ops agree with, well, you're given af ree pass
[19:14:12] <audrey> * a free
[19:14:26] <audrey> there is no sense of "impartiality" or "putting on your moderator hat"
[19:14:58] <biys> that is everywhere though
[19:15:07] <audrey> Which, I mean, is ultimately the channel owners' prerogative, right? But it's not a model I find appealing.
[19:15:16] <choozy> audrey, you can ban yourself?
[19:15:26] <biys> "channel owner"
[19:15:30] <biys> that idea makes me laugh
[19:15:40] <biys> the fact that nickservices and chanservice exist makes me laugh
[19:16:11] <biys> you can own a nickname

[19:19:55] <biys> sure
[19:20:32] <biys> i think the problem i have with it is the entire sector of conversation is made off limits to peopel as a result of one particular view or another
[19:22:47] <biys> or even as a result of one persons perception
[19:23:12] <biys> it's sad, to me anyways, that i have to go to the lurky underworld of the internet to discuss certain ideas that i really shouldn't have to
[19:23:41] <biys> having to significantly self censor to placate someone elses sense of self
[19:23:49] <biys> it's just wild that this is the day and age we live in
[19:25:04] <brigand> would they kill you irl?
[19:25:04] <biys> we're liberating the marginzalized all the while creating a people that are allergic to the discussion of ideas and concepts and will actually whine and complain that the conversation is being had instead of just walking away or ignoring the conversation
[19:25:50] <biys> waking away is being complicit!

[20:13:06] <audrey> The pain is senseless and never-ending
[20:13:38] <audrey> choozy: yes. though I think another op un-banned my self-ban
[20:13:51] <audrey> [10:44] <biys> that is everywhere though
[20:13:58] <audrey> To a certain extent, yes, but there are degrees of this

[20:14:03] <choozy> It is something that it's possible
[20:14:37] <audrey> You might ultimately argue that we cannot help but act in accordance with our pre-existing biases, as a neurological or psychological assertion.
[20:15:13] <audrey> But there seems to be various levels of this. "You just outed another person in front of 300 people but I agree with your politics so you're not even going to get a warning."
[20:15:32] <audrey> (yes, this happened to me; and yes, I am still somewhat sore about it)
[20:19:14] <alix> owned
[20:19:31] <alix> that's what you get for keeping secrets huh

[20:37:15] <audrey> I mean, outing people is at best just a classless thing to do, no?

[20:38:26] <audrey> It didn't result in any personal danger to myself, I suppose
[20:38:51] <audrey> but in general outing goes into the bucket of "bad things to do". i'm not sure what "keeping secrets" has to do with it
[20:39:12] <audrey> Many people who are gay or bi or whatever, prefer to keep those cards close to the vest.

[20:45:41] <arryana> it's a fucked up thing to do to someone.
[20:45:51] <arryana> and there's no reason to do it other than meanness
