[17:21:13] <dimadima> rebase is what i do all day
[17:21:23] <dimadima> how are you supposed to create useful git history without rebasing
[17:21:39] <dimadima> yeah, don't touch it once it hits main or gets deployed
[17:21:54] <dimadima> s/hits main/is shared with others
[17:22:15] <dimadima> i don't get how ppl can say you shouldn't rebase...
[17:22:30] <ignaloidas> those against rebase do not underdstand the concept that history can be useful, they only accept the "correct" history
[17:22:32] <ngoldbaum> you definitely shouldn’t rebase public history
[17:22:36] <dimadima> sometimes i even pause during a rebase and make a new commit, or edit an existing commit, and continue the rebase lol
[17:22:49] <ngoldbaum> but people have a hard time with the distinction brtween public and WIP history
[17:23:01] <ngoldbaum> so they just say never rebase to avoid the badness
[17:23:04] <dimadima> ignaloidas: by correct you mean "the random, useless commits they made the first time they committed?"
[17:23:19] <ngoldbaum> people don’t understand git but they do understand mantras and memorized workflows
[17:23:29] <dimadima> unless you're a genius who plays 3D chess with coding, how are you supposed to make the perfect history each time
[17:23:32] <dimadima> locally, before you even share it
[17:23:38] <ignaloidas> dimadima, yes, since that is "the actual evolution of the code"
[17:23:41] <dimadima> lol
[17:24:06] <ngoldbaum> is it really important to know that a feature went through 8 rounds of code review comments?
[17:24:43] <ignaloidas> it might be important to know where to find those comments, but not much more
[17:25:05] <dimadima> yep, and that place is the reflog
[17:25:08] <dimadima> home of the commits
[17:25:54] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: …until git gc happens
[17:26:03] <ignaloidas> you can't get the reflog of what I did :P
[17:26:07] <ngoldbaum> this is why evolve was better
[17:26:18] <ngoldbaum> but alas we can’t be in the good universe where hg won
[17:26:33] <dimadima> that's good i want you to clean up your commits into something that's not a reflection of you did
[17:26:40] <dimadima> or, uh, how you did it
[17:27:02] <dimadima> not *how* you did it, but *what* you did
[17:27:07] <ngoldbaum> with evolve you can have both clean public history and all the WIP history in the same repo
[17:27:08] <dimadima> and why
[17:27:27] <dimadima> that's like ppl who comment *how* instead of *why*
[17:27:46] <dimadima>  // Log
[17:27:55] <dimadima>  logger.info("starting")
[17:28:52] <ignaloidas> I feel that good commit messages can be a good replacement for WIP history
[17:29:15] <ignaloidas> but try teaching your colegues to write full commit messages
[17:30:59] <ngoldbaum> ignaloidas: and most code review tools actively make it more difficult to check
[17:31:05] <ngoldbaum> PRs are bad
[17:31:24] <dimadima> what do you mean commit messages vs WIP history
[17:31:34] <ngoldbaum> the unit of review should be a commit not a PR
[17:31:35] <dimadima> "WIP history" -> when your commit messages are "wip"?
[17:31:38] <ignaloidas> ngoldbaum, more news at 11
[17:32:11] <ignaloidas> dimadima, I mean, your commit message should reflect the reasons why you took the decisions that you did
[17:32:42] <ignaloidas> basically, stuff that didn't fit the comments
[17:32:58] <dimadima> ignaloidas: ah i see
[17:34:23] <ngoldbaum> also multi-paragraph commit messages are gold
[17:34:35] <ngoldbaum> we should encourage in-band explanations
[17:35:12] <ignaloidas> postgres commit history is amazing to read
[17:35:37] <dimadima> yeah projects like that are on another level

[17:41:54] <tmichel> what worked for us so far with github is that we squash merge PRs into a single commit and require the commit message to be descriptive for the "merge" commits
[17:44:45] <ngoldbaum> imo that’s bad too because you’ll tend to get large non-atomic commits
[17:45:07] <ngoldbaum> IMO each commit should do one thing and all the tests should pass on every commit
[17:47:05] <iDrougge> Yes. I had one colleague who squashed everything. So if you used blame, you would get information overload.
