[03:35:20] <cousteau> mehwork: if you don't want to preserve history, cloning with --depth=1 will create a "shallow clone".  You'll still get the whole snapshot and not just a single subdirectory, but you'll save a lot of data to download by just downloading the latest snapshot and not the whole history

[03:36:18] <cousteau> my experience with cloning / checking out only a subdir from a git repo is that it's not possible, but I don't know if newer versions allow it.  mackerman's trick suggests it is.

[03:39:10] <cousteau> unfortunately github doesn't have a "download this subdirectory as a zip file" feature, like it does for the whole repo.  I guess mackerman's trick probably works

[03:45:22] * cousteau is kinda disappointed they're not calling the main branch "trunk" like other version control software does
[03:45:30] <mehwork> i prefer main only because it's shorter

[03:46:16] <mehwork> trunk is probably offensive somehow, like to elephants or people who were kidnapped in trunks idk. I should stop before i actually offend someone
[03:46:57] <cousteau> "master" kinda gives the impression of "golden copy", "verified", which is kind of representative of what it should be
[03:47:38] <mehwork> words can have multiple meanings, but it now always defaults to whatever the offensive version is. That must be what you mean by it, that you only mean that one thing: that slavery is ok! :/
[03:47:54] <mehwork> anyway i'll never win that argument
[03:48:19] <ljharb> i'm glad it doesn't use the tree analogy, it reminds me too much of svn
[03:48:25] <ljharb> ("trunk", i mean)
[03:48:30] <cousteau> I think it was more a move to say "look, I know you're not going to be offended by this word, but just as a gesture to show good intentions I'm gonna stop using it"
[03:48:59] <mehwork> i remember when svn was the nice thing, because cvs was lame, but i'm old
[03:49:13] <cousteau> ljharb: dammit, there goes my theory that "trunk" wouldn't offend anyone
[03:49:24] <mehwork> i'm just glad i don't have to use svn anymore
[03:49:38] <ljharb> cousteau: non-distributed version control you can't rebase or force push definitely offends me
[03:49:50] <cousteau> I've used perforce
[03:50:27] <cousteau> I didn't know what all the noise about git being distributed was, then I had a look at perforce and svn, and now I finally understand it

[03:52:25] <cousteau> with perforce you actually need an internet connection to create a new branch or create a commit, so you end up having to actually sync with your teammates to work, which nobody wants to do.  The perfect teamwork is when you can do things on your own and taking the cooperation with other teammates to a minimum.

[03:54:06] <cousteau> ljharb: yeah it's more a matter of centralized vs distributed.  I guess the joy of using github also applies to other distributed SCMs such as hg or bzr
[03:55:09] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[03:55:32] <cousteau> basically having each employee/contributor work on their own separate copy, isolated from the rest, and eventually come back and say "hey this is what I got" is the ideal workflow.  It's secretly non-teamwork.
[03:57:17] <mehwork> actually seems like my best bet is to just shallow clone my entire private repo to /tmp then cp -r myrepo/foo bar

[03:59:08] <cousteau> but it seems to me that you're attempting to break one of the rules of git and using it as a dispatch system
[03:59:17] <cousteau> !dispatch
[03:59:25] <cousteau> hm no that wasn't the trigger

[04:20:35] <mehwork> also that still seemed to make a .git folder and has a bunch of rm'd files in it which seems dangerous if you accidentally git push

[09:24:46] <amixra> I needed a help regarding git actually I was new to git and when I was trying to push a repository into a remote repository on github by `git pull` It was throwing error and it was suggesting that i should do `git pull` first. I did the same and looks like my whole directory with all files with all my hours of work is overwritten with a Readme.md file. Is there any way to revert that condition?
[09:27:19] <ikke> amixra: first, what does `git status` mention? It should tell you what state you're in

[14:06:45] <Gaboradon> Hello
[14:07:48] <Gaboradon> So I learned about this recently, https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/8bcab0346d4fcf21b97046eb44db8cf37ddd6da0 , more specifically this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24976138

[14:09:13] <Gaboradon> And the way GPG signing of commits is supposed to be the answer to prevent and fix this, I never learned about it myself and I guess if it's not marked VERIFIED check then it shouldn't be trusted, it does not prevent this problem from happening tho.

[14:14:29] <Gaboradon> Maybe some kind of another approach to git push, verification with github and something else would make it so this shouldn't be possible. For example some kind of a key/hash that the developers would share privately which would allow them to push each other's commits, but would not allow anyone random to pose as them. Surely the security experts can cook up some idea.

[14:30:03] <Gaboradon> You'd have public keys and distribute them privately, and just regenerate if it gets leaked, old one stops working.
[14:30:48] <Gaboradon> Oh sure, I guess I just mentioned FWIW, if they can do it without git support then great, otherwise it may need cooperation.

[14:35:31] <Gaboradon> So some people said, earlier discussing this elsewhere,  that the whole point of git is to be able to push other contributor commits so this is supposably baked into git, or github, is that so?
[14:36:40] <bookworm> the issue is not the author field but that GH shows a commit not pushed by someone owning the repo under their url space
[14:36:59] <lericson> this is a github issue
[14:37:00] <bookworm> author != commiter is perfectly fine
[14:37:23] <bookworm> and that you can arbitrarily spoof a name is obvious too

[17:48:11] <Gaboradon> Just wondering, wouldn't git config want to do a path(string) check if "username" is contained anywhere in the target string when it does sudo --global , maybe useful in other cases similar, if it doesn't go against some linuxy policy of refusing to do workarounds for other's app problems, but that's another question that out of my exp.

[17:56:17] <Gaboradon> The issue is there's no warning of --global with sudo not writing to where --global intends to, even tho yes there is no issue, if you take sudo's stuff for granted and that hardcore linux stance where users must know every single bit ahead to know that sudo has it's own home and ..etc

[17:57:46] <osse> except inspecting sudo-specific env vars.
[17:58:17] <mackerman> I suggest not always using sudo.

[18:00:42] <osse> When git runs under sudo the username is root, so /root/.gitconfig *is* the correct place. Either Git would have to detect that the username is root and complain, but what if you intend to edit root's config? Or Git would have to look for sudo-specific variables in its environment.
[18:01:04] <Gaboradon> osse: right so I suggested when git issues command to write xyz data to file in ~/.gitconfig, why couldn't it internally first expand what the full string of that target path is, then do a string search and see if it contains /username/, wouldn't that do it and be the simplest thing, it's relying on the variable ~ , even if it's ran as sudo, it should have access to see environmental vars for all other users on the system and figure .... right, how to
[18:01:05] <Gaboradon> figure out which user if there's multiple, but okay, then I would simply have it error out, and not write to any user, that should do it.

[18:03:39] <mackerman> I don't want it to have sudo specific behavior.  sudo is not necessary, there are other ways to switch users.
[18:04:02] <selckin> Gaboradon: you logic is flowed is that you assume its run as the user then permissions are elevated to root somehow to write something, no you become root first, then it runs git
[18:04:02] <Gaboradon> Basically if this $SUDO_USER is a standard thing then it can just silently edit the target path to force it to write to /home/$SUDO_USER/.gitconfig, no warning needed.

[22:03:27] <nightstrike> When I rebase my branch on master, I typically do the following:  git checkout master; git pull; git checkout branch; git rebase master; git push -f origin branch;  << doing that makes my local branch lose its connection to its upstream counterpart, so I then have to follow it with "git branch --set-upstream branch origin/branch"; How can I stop that from happening?
