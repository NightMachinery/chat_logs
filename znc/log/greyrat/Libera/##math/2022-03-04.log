Speed = Distance/Time where speed is (i suppose) the speed at which the density changes. Sub in the numbers to get 10^3 (m)/10days = 0.001ms^-1.

[03:44:26] <elPuma> i.e. a function that is continuous at every real number? I'm certain polynomials were studied long before calculus was invented,
[03:44:26] <elPuma> but the formal defintion of a polynomial seems like a convenient way to classify functions whose graphs are "smooth" and "unbroken".

[03:51:51] <greenbagels> smoothness of polynomials is a consequence of smoothness of the multiplication and addition maps

[03:52:23] <newpy> shouldn't resistance = pressure/flow = N/m^2/m^3/sec = N/m^2 * sec/m^3 = Newton*sec/m^5?

[03:58:07] <PlanckWalk> I haven't seen that unit

[03:58:45] <PlanckWalk> No, viscosity is usually Ns/m^2

[03:59:53] <newpy> similar to V = IR for circuits
[04:01:16] <PlanckWalk> Resistance in circuit doesn't really behavce anything like viscosity in fluids
[04:01:26] <PlanckWalk> Just that the outcome might have similar effects
[04:01:54] <PlanckWalk> (For a given geometry etc)
[04:02:13] <PlanckWalk> It's not even linear
[04:02:27] <PlanckWalk> (Over a suitably large range)
[04:02:54] <PlanckWalk> Streamline flow resistance is fairly linear, but not once you get into turbulence
[04:04:05] <newpy> I'm going over this site's quick tutorial: https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/C3_Electronics.htm
[04:04:24] <newpy> checkpoint 3.4 says I should be getting Newton*sec/m, just not sure if it's wrong or I'm doing something wrong lol
[04:05:00] <PlanckWalk> Even then the relation between viscosity and flow resistance is nothing like the relation between relectrical resistivity and resistance.
[04:05:43] <PlanckWalk> If you double the cross-section area of a conductor for a given potential you get double the current.
[04:06:11] <PlanckWalk> But for fluids (even with streamline flow) the relation is nonlinear.

[05:35:48] <tusko> c1=-c2

[05:36:14] <greenbagels> sure
[05:36:30] <greenbagels> or differentiate, plug in 0, and now you hve a system of 2 linear equations in 2 vars
[05:36:32] <greenbagels> same thing tho
[05:37:07] <tusko> y(t) = -c2e^-t + c2e^-2t so y'(t)= c2e^-t - 2c2e^-2t

[07:09:10] <somiaj> the numbers can vary depending on school
[07:09:28] <Jong> I don't quite understand what "precalculus" is, as in how it's different from algebra and trig
[07:09:47] <somiaj> as for covers all of calculus, a standard book that is used are along the lines of James Stewarts book (fairly popular to be taught from). Though kinda spendy
[07:10:31] <somiaj> lots and lots of other books are very similar to this, you can find online OEM books that cover the same stuff. Paul's online notes is very standard, there is a book called active calculus and lots of other OEM calculus books. These are all very standard to me
[07:10:35] <Jong> Any opinion on The Prentice-Hall Encyclopedia of Mathematics ?
[07:10:44] <somiaj> precalclus = algebra + trig focused on what will be needed in calculus.
[07:10:47] <Jong> or The Penguin Desk Encyclopedia of Science and Mathematics ?
[07:11:19] <somiaj> Math people like Spivak's calculus, it is more mathy, closer to what we call anaylsis, and teaches calculus from a math view point (vs a computation engineering viewpoint)
[07:11:33] <somiaj> Though it won't cover what you call caluclus 3, which is multi-variable calculus.
[07:11:47] <Jong> what would teaching it from a computation engineering viewpoint look like?
[07:12:04] <somiaj> I'm not much of a book person. My shelves have tons of calculus books (I teach calculus), but I wouldn't recommended any of them. To many OEM/online sources that are just as good. Though some people do like physical copies.
[07:12:34] <somiaj> James Stewart is a very popular book, I think it is okay (as far as any of these books are), and does have a nice balance between showign how to do computation and explaining partly where they come from.

[07:13:28] <somiaj> Jong: It is more the theory of calculs, so you worry about defining things, and proving things. You prove the existance of the real numbers and all their nice properities. You prove all the derivative rules and how they follow from the (limit) definition.
[07:13:33] <Jong> somiaj  this looks cheap to me: https://www.ebay.com/itm/373600495357?epid=2607752&hash=item56fc5326fd:g:0FkAAOSwTCBiAfQn
[07:13:34] <somiaj> In general you explain the why vs the how
[07:14:15] <somiaj> That looks like a very old edition. If I were to guess it is 4th edition. We are currently using the 9th
[07:14:19] <Fangs> Jong: you can generally take your calculus learning journey in 2 general step
[07:14:33] <Fangs> (pre calc + calculus in 1 dimension.. or just "calculus")
[07:14:35] <Fangs> then
[07:14:47] <Fangs> (*some* linear algebra + multivariable calculus)
[07:14:53] <Jong> I prefer books written in the 70s-90s over books written after.
[07:15:16] <Fangs> idk about the first part of that book. but Multivariable mathematics Book by Theodore Shifrin is my personal favourite book
[07:15:20] <Fangs> unfortunately its written in 2003
[07:15:32] <Jong> Books published in the last 20 years have been generally poor. Overly verbose with ununderstandable explanations
[07:15:53] <somiaj> I like stewart, it does toe the line between how to compute things vs here is where the concepts come from. Most of the coplaints I hear about stewart are mostly what students learn, vs what the book has in it
[07:16:18] <alphamule2> It's nice how recent analysis of black holes leads to link between Platonic math and pragmatic physics.
[07:16:21] <somiaj> Stwearts book updates are fairly good, a lot of the rough edges are moved out, nicer graphics, etc
[07:16:30] <int-e> Jong: Books published have been generally poor. Books still in print after 20 years have passed the test of time.
[07:16:33] <alphamule2> (Talking information theorywise)
[07:16:42] <Fangs> Jong: which 'recent' books have you been looking at?
[07:16:55] <Jong> int-e  that's likely it
[07:17:57] <Jong> Fangs  none. I just bought 4 calculus books on ebay right now.
[07:18:19] <Fangs> 14:45 <Jong> Books published in the last 20 years have been generally poor. Overly verbose with ununderstandable explanations
[07:18:22] <Jong> But in other subjects, I've found the older books to be better nearly always
[07:18:22] <Fangs> was going to ask for an example
[07:19:34] <Fangs> I would guess calculus is a bit difficult to do that. notation change and 'newer' book (meaning not written in the 60s or 70s) are probably easier to read

[07:20:12] <Fangs> (TeX was invented 1978 apparently.. so any book before then are likely to be type-written. they tend to be difficult to read if youre not used to it)
[07:20:21] <somiaj> Sometimes the flow of topics is changed, applications to be more appropriate to modern examples, etc
[07:20:30] <Fangs> that too
[07:20:42] <Jong> these are the books I just bought https://imgur.com/a/POk034D
[07:21:27] <Fangs> ok you have a book that somiaj mentioned.. by stewart thats the top of the list
[07:21:36] <Jong> I just ordered it after he mentioned it
[07:21:50] <alphamule2> Some books are designed to make the author money, who knew.

[07:21:59] <Fangs> Jong: idk if Ted Shiffirin's book on linear algebra is any good, but his Multivariable Maths treats linear algebra and multivariable calculus together
[07:22:24] <Fangs> in some sense its a much better way to learn multivariable calculus if thats your goal
[07:22:39] <alphamule2> Funny:  Found older typesetting to often be more careful and custom but YMMV
[07:22:54] <Jong> I love buying books on the same subject, and comparing them, seeing what was excluded in one that was included in the other and so forth
[07:23:10] <Fangs> Jong: you should check libgen or borrow these books from the library
[07:23:14] <alphamule2> They also had weird limits
[07:23:17] <Fangs> I assume youre enrolled in a university of sort?
[07:23:20] <alphamule2> i.e. Superscripts
[07:23:56] <Jong> Fangs  I graduated with a CS degree over 10 years ago
[07:24:22] <Fangs> whats the goal of your study?

[07:28:24] <somiaj> I saw int-e recentally
[07:28:34] <somiaj> though there is ##math-ops I think
[07:28:45] <Fangs> right
[07:28:47] <somiaj> yea, in the /topic, see ##math-ops for the operators
[07:29:34] <int-e> somiaj: the org is just me currently... no deep reason for that, except no other op showed any interest so far
[07:30:05] <Fangs> ill just talk here then.. ill post the archive link here too
[07:30:18] <somiaj> Fangs: seems there is the answer.
[07:31:31] <Fangs> https://web.archive.org/web/20211128201642/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm Jong you can find some recommended books on some of these lists
[07:32:11] <Fangs> I used that when I was an undergrad and generally the books there are what my peers would call 'classic'. they might be a bit outdated for the current generation, but I dont think you care about that
[07:32:45] <int-e> Fangs: So... none of the links are currently dead, right?
[07:32:59] <Fangs> no not yet
[07:33:24] <int-e> Yeah I won't change them to archived pages practively, that's silly.
[07:33:27] <Fangs> int-e: the chicago one is a bit iffy. that's the one i was worried most about
[07:33:45] <int-e> *proactively
[07:34:01] <Fangs> int-e: I'll check if all the links exists in the archive
[07:34:56] <int-e> Sure, that's a good idea.
[07:36:11] <Fangs> my uni just changed domain name for researcher's personal page
[07:36:27] <Fangs> the consequence is that people were still using the old link and now they're all dead, its really annoying
[07:36:47] <Fangs> they all exists in the archive, at least as recent as 2021
[07:36:57] <Fangs> (the ones in /topic)
[07:37:02] <somiaj> yea, I had to fangale with OIT a lot when they did that to us. But i was able to setup forwards for most things
[07:38:15] <Fangs> we just get a generic university-wide page not found. some of the faculties here have 'huge' (as in a lot of neat resources) personal page
[07:38:40] <somiaj> yea, basically due to accessiblity laws, they made us shut down all of the old pages like that

[07:39:04] <alphamule2> I find that newer books assume you have access to specific tools or setups.
[07:39:31] <alphamule2> Although not always
[07:39:51] <somiaj> so at least for us, as long as we don't host the content on the universities domain name, they don't care. To me it is shooting themselves in their foot thoug, because mroe and more indvidual profs no longer have their name assoicated with the unverisity once they move to their own domain.
[07:39:57] <alphamule2> Older books on other hand didn't really address this cheap computer in your pocket.
[07:40:29] <alphamule2> So, wait, removing access is ironic...

[12:47:34] <Decker> so... from 2d to 3d adding 1 axis adds 2 rotation axes that overlap the existing axes.  really the same from 3d to 4d, the new rotation axis overlap the existing 3; and it's not until you get to 5D that you could have a axis that looks like overlapping W (though I expect that's not really the case anyway)...
[12:48:55] <Decker> https://i.ibb.co/JqwLwZ7/image.png
[12:49:27] <blackk> You are just comparing the dimensions of SO(n) vs SO(n+1)
[12:49:40] <blackk> if I understood correctly
[12:49:50] <Decker> but really the 3 new axes that get added that rotate x->w y->w and z->w don't really overlap anything, and are still imaginary like the original i,j,k which just happen to overlap the z,x,y axes (and not even in the right order at that)
[12:50:26] <Decker> and fails applying the analogy going from 3 back to 2; that the new axies overlaps an existing rotation that was a thing before it was
[12:50:46] <blackk> The dimension (the amount of axis needed) in nD is just n(n-1)/2
[12:52:18] <blackk> So the added axis from nD to (n+1)D is just n
[12:52:20] <Decker> hmm... that's probably the sum from 1 to n of n-1 ?sure the half triangle of the square...
[12:52:53] <blackk> yes because the orthogonal nxn matrices are completely determined by the upper half diagonal and the sum of the number of entries is just that

[16:03:38] <Guest61> I'm struggling trying to see what's happening here https://imgur.com/a/L9Gpffa - i'm looking at i) my thoughts are: Steady state implies that the rate of change of density is zero wrt time is zero. Speed = Distance/Time where speed is (i suppose?) the speed at which the density changes. Sub in the numbers to get 10^3 (m)/10days = 0.001ms^-1. Which
[16:03:38] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[16:03:38] <Guest61> is like an order of magnitude slower than flow rate (0.1ms^-1) therefore flow can be approximated as steady state.
[16:03:50] <Guest61> Does this seem legit?

[18:55:36] <Guest61> I'm struggling trying to see what's happening here https://imgur.com/a/L9Gpffa - i'm looking at i) my thoughts are: Steady state implies that the rate of change of density is zero wrt time is zero. Speed = Distance/Time where speed is (i suppose?) the speed at which the density changes. Sub in the numbers to get 10^3 (m)/10days = 0.001ms^-1. Which
[18:55:37] <Guest61> is like an order of magnitude slower than flow rate (0.1ms^-1) therefore flow can be approximated as steady state.
[18:55:38] <Guest61> Does this seem legit?

[23:29:55] <sonny> Does it indicate anything about the terms being monotonic?
[23:30:03] <average> sonny: and is it strictly increasing monotonic
[23:30:15] <average> sonny: you have to prove that it is monotonic ..
[23:30:50] <sonny> I don't know, I am looking at this statement P(n) : x_1 ... x_n <= ((x_1 + ... + x_n)/n)^2
[23:31:02] <sonny> then after comes that if condition

[23:38:03] <greenbagels> sonny: it means each of the x_i are nonnegative
[23:38:52] <greenbagels> your statement is just "the squared averaged of a list of nonnegative numbers is >= any of the numbers"

[23:45:56] <sonny> greenbagels thanks
[23:46:15] <sonny> so by rearranging to get the second relation I posted, I'm done?
[23:46:56] <greenbagels> no; there's not really any "rearranging" you can do with the first statement

[23:47:20] <greenbagels> x1, ..., x_n >= 0 means "x1 >= 0 and x2 >= 0 and ... xn >= 0"
[23:48:55] <Yilo> if I have the ODE: sin(x) * y'(x) = 0, my professor just solved instead y'(x) = 0. Why can we do that?
[23:49:56] <greenbagels> Yilo: if y' = 0, then sin * y' = 0, too; so solutions of your prof's equation are also solutions of the original one
[23:50:01] <greenbagels> (the opposite isnt always true)
[23:50:22] <Yilo> why don't we assume sin is zero?
[23:50:33] <greenbagels> you should think about that

[23:50:53] <greenbagels> considering where sin(x) is zero means y'(x) can be nonzero, but only at those points
[23:51:46] <greenbagels> this likely contradicts some assumption you're making about y
