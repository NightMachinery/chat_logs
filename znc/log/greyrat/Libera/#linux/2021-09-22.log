[07:35:30] <mlu> Dagmar: how well does Perl work for stored procedures anyways?
[07:35:32] * mlu implements mlu
[07:35:56] <Hash> SQL is a combination of data manipulation and data declaration
[07:36:01] <Hash> It's not purely declarative.
[07:36:13] <Dagmar> mlu: It works fine for that.  It's not like it's hard to do $sth->prepare('CALL someProcedureIwrote(?, ?, ?, ?, ?);');

[07:36:56] <mlu> I'd say it's actually kind of similar to Lisp
[07:37:13] <mlu> most of my SQL projects are just a bunch of selects and joins
[07:37:33] <Dagmar> Meanwhile I'm slowly folding and spindling a label evaluation matrix into procedures
[07:37:40] <mlu> procedures are rare, but there was this one time I had to do some JSONB operations in a transaction
[07:37:53] <Dagmar> Procedures should be _less rare_
[07:38:05] <Dagmar> Giving something access to read an entire database is often quite insane
[07:38:25] <mlu> row-level permissions, yay

[07:39:50] <mlu> hmm, now I"m kind of curious what the procedures are for

[07:40:01] <mlu> ah, attribute-based permissions enforcement?
[07:40:09] <Dagmar> The procedures ensure NO ONE can put stupid data in and create a non-contiguous timeline
[07:40:21] <mlu> ah, a time-series database, neat :)

[07:44:11] <mlu> plenty of good places for optimization by parallelization

[12:35:28] <hexnewbie> You can get completion by simply using readline(). The basic syntax (including fork() + exec with pipe support) is doable in a two hours exam, and is mostly the same between bash and command.com. However, completing the rest of the shell with DOS-compatible features will be months of fitting a square peg in a round hole.

[23:55:39] <paulcarroty> books are good for theory, you actually learn when you build something
[23:55:57] <Voxel> ayecee, I'm sorry, but usually I look at review count. 100 people rated the book from the whole Linux community of the globe and of course it was interesting to mention.
[23:56:09] <n4dir> big books are better though, you can use them for workout too
[23:56:17] <Krail> no, 100 amazon customers rated t he book
[23:56:20] <Phase> I'd honestly wager a guess to say most linux users learn by doing, not by books
[23:56:36] <tangy> amazon reviews could mean anything
[23:56:45] <Voxel> For example, every book I bought either is too specific, is new or has at least 2000 or >5000 rating.
[23:57:03] <Phase> Like, as a random example, if I'm having problems using `sudo`, I'm not gonna go read linux newbie book, I'm gonna google sudo + whatevermyproblemis
[23:57:04] <n4dir> i guess checking several in the public library is a good approach.
[23:57:06] <anon> Voxel: well, it entirely depends on what you want them to know
[23:57:06] <tangy> possibly acm or accu reviews on the other hand...?
[23:57:38] <ayecee> Voxel: that's an interesting perspective and not one i'd considered. it's been a long time since i've bought a technical book, so i don't know what a typical review count would be.

[23:58:20] <Voxel> Of course, Phase. Although, it seems they use for a months and still only complain. When I joined Linux, I didn't complain at all and was fascinating with the freedom of choice and opportunities. Of course, issues were raised, but every single issue was possible to fix either manually or with a help of the community.
