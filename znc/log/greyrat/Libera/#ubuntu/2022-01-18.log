[00:30:30] <driador> greetings all, quick question.  I am trying to update the default java version on a server from 1.11 to 1.8.  My method thus far has been to install the package openjdk 1.8, then programatically set that via update-java-alternatives (update-java-alternatives -s $(update-java-alternatives -l | grep 1.8 | awk '{print $1})).  However, if I then do something like readlink -f /var/lib/jvm/default-java it still
[00:30:36] <driador> points to openjdk-11.  What am I missing here to set the default to 1.8.  Note that I need to do this programatically (if that wasn't clear already :)).

[16:33:04] <jkaye> Recently upgraded to 21.10 - there's a new sidebar behavior that's driving me insane. If an application has a notification (even with OS notifications disabled), the icon "wiggles" and forces the sidebar open. Anyone know how I can disable this?
[16:34:15] <guesswhat> tomreyn: i am not sure, what i need, my use case is to run cloustack on single bare metal, but i need to simulate management network ( it wont be accessible, but its needed ), see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i3_uFRi4wkAxs4CqVQR6pCdn-l3fL149/view?usp=sharing
[16:34:35] <tomreyn> jkaye: a screenshot might help illustrate what you're referring to, in case you can't get anyone respond to it as is.
[16:35:05] <jkaye> tomreyn, I can definitely provide one, it would just look like the sidebar being open though haha

[19:49:59] <ubercube> Hi all. I'm having a bit of trouble installing ubuntu 20.04.03 LTS server on a UEFI Secure Boot system. The desktop .iso, dd'd to a usb drive shows up fine in the boot selector. The server .iso, dd'd to the same usb drive and inserted into the same USB port doesn't show up in the boot selector. Is there a way I can use the desktop .iso to install
[19:49:59] <ubercube> only the server components, or should I be doing something else to try and make progress?

[19:52:35] <ubercube> I'm certain I can install if I disable secure boot and turn on compatibility mode. But will there be a way to use the server with secure boot enabled later if I do that? The goal is to have the system use UEFI Secure Boot with LUKS and memory encryption. I'm happy to follow any path that might get me to that goal, or to be educated about better

[20:41:56] <americaaaaa> how can i update the grub menu on a bootable live usb disk
[20:42:08] <americaaaaa> i keep getting "failed to get canonical path of /cow"
[20:42:10] <llanhmod> leftyfb: before I open a bug, is this release note worthy to make a bug report with?

[20:42:49] <americaaaaa> i am NOT trying to update grub on an existing partition, just on the live usb so it can boot to another partition
[20:43:07] <llanhmod> consider this me determining if the bug is really worth reporting (a bug)
[20:43:23] <leftyfb> americaaaaa: you do it from the boot menu when you first boot. Each time it boots. Not permanently

[20:43:41] <americaaaaa> so i don't have to do that each time
[20:43:52] <leftyfb> americaaaaa: then you roll your own iso, which isn't supported here but is documented
[20:44:11] <americaaaaa> that seems unnecessary
[20:44:42] <leftyfb> americaaaaa: it is 100% necessary
[20:44:57] <americaaaaa> just to update a grub menu

[20:52:25] <llanhmod> or a physical pentester....
[20:52:35] * llanhmod not going there though
[20:52:55] <ubercube> FYI using the .iso files directly over IPMI media sharing is the same result - desktop .iso is bootable, and server isn't. Even with SB disabled. I'll try the same with both dd and etcher and the server iso and a real USB stick.

[20:59:18] <ubercube> turning on compatibility support mode in the bios does allow the server iso to boot (non-EFI). I'll try the legacy image you recommended without the CSM next.
[21:00:07] <leftyfb> ubercube: also, with a server, I see no benefit to EFI. If you can disable, just get the OS installed. How the system boots shouldn't matter
[21:00:12] <ubercube> leftyfb: the ipmi is asrock rack's. I just got them to fix an nvme BIOS bug that only manifested in linux, so I can approach them with this, too, if it's reproducible.

[22:35:44] <ubercube> it highlights column 65 lol. you need diff -t to expand tabs, and less -R to display escape sequences raw
[22:35:47] <ash_worksi> so, the problem there I think will be the .{64} since apparently diff outputs trailing space after `group` as tabs
[22:35:53] <ash_worksi> ah
[22:36:23] <ubercube> I always enjoy stupid terminal tricks :D

[22:37:43] <ash_worksi> I wish there was a bit more flexibility over highlighting in general in less though; it would come in handy if said highlighting persisted across pages, like when I have a huge table in psql and want to highlight a row that has gaps
[22:38:11] <ubercube> less is more :)
[22:38:26] <ash_worksi> although one could probably argue at that point I am probably looking at things the wrong way
[22:38:30] <ash_worksi> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:38:56] <ramblebamble> ash_worksi, do one thing and do it well, however, if you need s.th. like less, with hightlighting capabilities, look at bat

[22:40:43] <ramblebamble> something
[22:40:46] <ubercube> I use less -R a lot, because it allows other things that know how to apply the appropriate colors and highlighting for the data that less has no knowledge of, to be used.
