[00:07:18] <tubbo> sorta, i think lerna is still pretty useful for versioning and release management
[00:07:47] <tubbo> there are other tools you can use like `semantic-release` but i've found them all to be lacking in one way or another. `lerna version` "just works" the way i want it to.

[05:18:14] <codebam> how do I make this into a type? const DynamicTypes = typeof 'currentReward' | 'currentChange'

[05:18:31] <codebam> so that it could be either of those strings
[05:19:16] <GreenJello> unclear what you're trying to do there
[05:19:28] <GreenJello> maybe you want a type alias?
[05:19:43] <codebam> I'm trying to define a new type that I could apply to something when declaring it

[05:20:45] <jaawerth> for "one of xyz values" you may also consider https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html
[05:21:33] <jaawerth> but just to be clear since it's called "DynamicTypes" in your example, typescript types only  exist at compiletime so they can't be dynamic in the runtime sense

[05:26:28] <jaawerth> are we supposed to know what you're referring to?
[05:29:40] <cis> the internal state of Promise objects - "pending"/"fulfilled"/"rejected"
[05:31:28] <systemfault> It's pretty useless in the real world... and would probably lead to some really awful anti-pattern... like polling promises
[05:31:39] <jaawerth> oh I thought you had, like, a code snippet
[05:32:31] <cis> systemfault: I thought that might be it, just curious
[05:34:24] <jaawerth> some promise implementations do expose a '_settled' property or similar but it's not in the spec and probably never will be, since a promise is supposed to represent a future value (or future error), and is intended to be interacted with that way

[08:57:43] <systemfault> Congrats :p
[08:58:30] <wroathe> systemfault: Haha, well I'm evaluating whether or not I'm going to use it for a rather large project, and one of the many considerations is keeping the project's size manageable.

[08:58:55] <wroathe> systemfault: I haven't made my decision yet. Going to type a few more samples.
[08:59:23] <sheetjs> are you using vscode?
[08:59:34] <wroathe> Yeah
[08:59:50] <sheetjs> typescript is better
[09:00:03] <sheetjs> just in terms of sheer documentation ability
[09:00:14] <wroathe> Yeah, that's definitely in the "pros" column
[09:00:23] <wroathe> And probably the thing that's most heavily leaning me towards yes
[09:00:37] <systemfault> Extending DOM-like structures isn't a typical case...
[09:00:45] <wroathe> The secondary concern is interface compatibility between libraries
[09:00:50] <sheetjs> the tradeoffs were different in the past
[09:00:52] <wroathe> Also leaning me towards yes
[09:01:25] <wroathe> between library versions*
[09:01:25] <sheetjs> in a world where modern web dev requires transpilers and node modules galore, using typescript isn't fundamentally different from using javascript
[09:02:29] <gde35> sheetjs: nonsense https://jsfiddle.net/0ozpvq8r/2/show
[09:02:35] <theskillwithin> wroathe I hope you mean for backend only
[09:02:54] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Not necessarily. Why?
[09:03:03] <sheetjs> why is this animated gde35
[09:03:25] <gde35> sheetjs: to impress the visitor ofc!
[09:03:30] <theskillwithin> catholic typescript
[09:03:46] <systemfault> TypeScript + React has some annoying quirks when templates are involved but it's not that bad...
[09:03:51] <wroathe> sheetjs: As discussed above, one potential drawback that I'm concerned about is having to maintain the types in code. I suspect this will result in roughly 50% more code to maintain on a large project.
[09:03:52] <theskillwithin> wroathe its just a fucking pain in the butt on frontend
[09:03:59] <sheetjs> its like that spinning globe on github's homepage that makes the fans going full blast
[09:04:14] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Yeah, dealing with lib.dom.ts certainly seems to be in the "con" column
[09:04:36] <sheetjs> yeah there'll always be more code but vscode will guide you (so in practice you wont be typing more)
[09:04:44] <systemfault> wroathe: Do you prefer to maintain them in JSDoc? ;)
[09:05:04] <wroathe> systemfault: For applications it's not always a guarantee that there will be JSDoc :P
[09:05:07] <systemfault> In the end... the code (types in code) is the truth
[09:05:11] <systemfault> true that...
[09:05:19] <sheetjs> you dont even need to write types
[09:05:31] <sheetjs> inference is ok for simple code
[09:05:47] <wroathe> Yup. That's definitely in the "pro" column.
[09:05:49] <systemfault> I only write them for function and class signatures that I actually "expose/export"
[09:05:59] <systemfault> Or when the TypeSystem fails to infer them...
[09:06:19] <theskillwithin> systemfault and TS is a pain on frontend right?  so prob limit to backend
[09:06:37] <systemfault> theskillwithin: Nah, it's not worse than having to write a ton of prop types..
[09:06:49] <wroathe> systemfault: Indeed. I've been toying with the idea of only requiring type information for library APIs that this team will be building. Code that is "internal" to a library is not necessarily as high value to static typecheck
[09:06:51] <systemfault> But yes, small quirks with templates + JSX
[09:06:54] <theskillwithin> config hell
[09:07:05] <gde35> sheetjs: howabout doing the website as a csv then parse it one character at a time animated?
[09:07:07] <systemfault> Frontend is config hell no matter what :p
[09:07:15] <systemfault> But yeah, TSC vs Babel...
[09:08:23] <sheetjs> gotta use warcraft-style slk
[09:08:44] <wroathe> It's always spreadsheets with you.

[09:48:42] <theskillwithin> weather its inside something, or beside something, or just on its own
[09:49:01] <sheetjs> given how most fonts render S and 5, a hybrid design could make for a cool logo

[10:05:23] <sheetjs> here's an example from hours ago https://jsfiddle.net/v46kgup3/
[10:05:39] <sheetjs> it fetches an XLSX from a different domain
[10:06:04] <mattf> sheetjs: ok but isn't the cors problem only determined by the headers sent by the api?
[10:06:23] <mattf> so it is a matter of setting up the api server accordingly
[10:06:29] <mattf> I guess?
[10:06:49] <sheetjs> server has to support it
[10:08:31] <mattf> sheetjs: i can configure the serevr
[10:08:35] <mattf> what header am i missing
[10:09:07] <mattf> sheetjs: https://jsfiddle.net/6duhb90p/
[10:09:26] <mattf> Its a classical: "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at... "
[10:09:57] <mattf> but if you look on the headers it is all set
[10:10:00] <sheetjs> why is access-control-allow-origin sent back twice?
[10:10:05] <sheetjs> the error calls it out
[10:10:15] <sheetjs> The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values '*, *', but only one is allowed. Have the server send the header with a valid value, or, if an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
[10:12:13] <mattf> oh so thats the problem
[10:12:40] <sheetjs> its in the console
[10:13:37] <GreenJello> sheetjs, you're still using firefox after mozilla betrayed you?
[10:13:45] <sheetjs> chrome
[10:14:16] <GreenJello> then you wouldn't expect the same console warnings
[10:14:52] <sheetjs> the quoted message is from chrome.  the fiddle is not working in chrome either, so there's a good chance that the error applies to both

[12:06:42] <systemfault> The nuance matters... but not to someone who just wants to play with S3
[12:06:47] <undefined_bob> but they are very different like normal files because objects do exist without a filesystem?
[12:07:27] <systemfault> A filesytem is hierarchical, you have directories and files...etc and you're limited by your disks
[12:07:44] <undefined_bob> a huge monkey wrench, yes :D
[12:07:52] <systemfault> An object storage is not hierarchical and is spread on a lot of machines (distributed)

[12:59:04] <systemfault> Hmm
[12:59:25] <auser0> hehe ty, still don't understand, like Math.random() * this huge number will give me a bigger number but like how does it work
[12:59:26] <systemfault> Not sure how to convert a big int to a hex string
[12:59:51] <auser0> i expected to just give me a single number not that big number, like a single float-point digit
[13:00:44] <auser0> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
[13:01:02] <systemfault> Math.random() gives a number between 0 and 1

[14:27:23] <thykka> the people who I work with have never complained about using Array.from in place of creating an array AND .mapping it. And personally I don't think it's a good stance to dismiss tools made for the very task in hand, over some arguably more readable way. I suck at metaphors, but here's another: It's better to hit the drill with a hammer, because the drill's hammer-mode switch is under the
[14:27:24] <thykka> handle, so it's not obvious to anyone.
[14:30:28] <silly_> i always thought the 2nd argument was misplaced, and why map? why not forEach or any other method? i don't like it

[18:09:38] <nagualcode> need some advice here. I am building a the website store for my girlfriend clothes project. At first glance I was thinking going full vanilla javascript + html/css route. I will be using github pages. The product catalog would be a JSON file, and the cliet javascript would build the visualization. So to reach directly to a product , you would navigate to https://fashionshop.com?product=232    But this seems to be not seo friendly, and do not gener

[18:12:39] <nagualcode> thykka: iterate over the JSON catalogue, and insert content to the dom, like item = document.createElement("div");
[18:13:07] <thykka> that could be a problem for SEO

[18:15:55] <austincheney> nagualcode, if you are trying to sell things keep it simple.  don't do something stupid like a SPA.  At that point its just developer self-masturabation that wont sell clothing
[18:15:55] <silly> with that in mind, move the + button to the render method, sort your const in order and it'll work
[18:15:56] <thykka> but I did nothing

[18:17:42] <austincheney> nagualcode, there are three goals with ecommerce: merchandise, display inventory, checkout/convert.  That third one is all that really matters, but upselling is important too.

[22:09:33] <GreenJello> that's a strange thing to take a minimum of, but you want a minBy function

[22:12:29] <no_gravity> Maybe Math.min can be used with the spread operator in some way.
[22:13:09] <GreenJello> if you convert them all to numbers first
[22:13:20] <GreenJello> what are you actually trying to do here?
[22:13:23] <no_gravity> Yeah, then I'm done I guess.
[22:14:22] <no_gravity> GreenJello: I am writing a mindmap software and when the user selects a bunch of elements and says "Align left" then I calculate the min and max left of the selected elements, calculate the average and set all elements style.left to that number.

[22:49:08] <qswz> or decades
[22:51:25] <DPA> em/rem depends on the systems font size, which tends to be scaled to a size people like to read at for whatever distance & screen size they look at it.
[22:51:25] <DPA> The 1 thing I like px for is white 1px borders on black backgrounds. Although for best results, I need to account for browsers using more than 1 px per px. But after that, it's like cutting with a knife.
[22:52:16] <DPA> So sharp. I love it.
[22:52:21] <GreenJello> yeah, I mostly use pixels for things <5px

[23:56:03] <GreenJello> Guest67, this looks like a private key
[23:56:14] <Guest67> the access token?
[23:56:18] <GreenJello> yeah
[23:56:29] <Guest67> interesting
[23:56:35] <merpnderp> I'm not sure what does the formatting in my vue projects. I guess eslint?
[23:56:44] <Guest67> don't think you can do much with it though unless you have the other stuff i X'd out
[23:56:47] <merpnderp> What does it in a create-react-app project?
[23:56:59] <merpnderp> With VSCode?
[23:57:14] <Guest67> it changes every time i refresh the page though
