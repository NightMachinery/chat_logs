[09:26:27] <quanticle> Oh god, that Twitter thread about the fridges with the "smart" screens
[09:26:41] <quanticle> I now have an emotional appreciation for how Luddites felt
[09:27:50] <quanticle> Because my first instinct upon seeing that was, "I should go in there with a crowbar, and walk calmly down the aisle methodically smashing every screen until either 1) all the screens are smashed or 2) I'm tackled to the ground by cops
[09:27:58] <companion_cube> luddites weren't even against machines, were they?
[09:28:11] <companion_cube> they were against their jobs being taken away
[09:28:29] <quanticle> Yeah, Luddites weren't anti-technology they were anti-dehumanizing technology
[09:29:21] <quanticle> And I feel dehumanized by fridges that collect analytics on me while I try to figure out which brand of frozen microwave bean burritos I'm getting
[09:29:25] <companion_cube> my instinct would be spray paint that shit
[09:29:37] <companion_cube> make it too expensive
[09:29:43] <quanticle> Spray paint would probably be more effective
[09:29:46] <quanticle> You can go faster
[09:29:48] <quanticle> But
[09:29:57] <quanticle> A crowbar is just so much more *satisfying*
[09:29:59] <companion_cube> maybe also more discrete
[09:30:47] <companion_cube> the real way is to hack these and put some gross porn on it
[09:30:58] <quanticle> I suppose if you really wanted to be discreet, you could just put small stickers over the cameras
[09:31:00] <quanticle> Rendering them blind
[09:31:07] <companion_cube> fastest way to have a chain store remove stuff
[09:31:37] <companion_cube> or have the cameras see people go by and print racist slurs on the screen
[09:31:40] <companion_cube> then you get a PR problem
[09:33:56] <quanticle> Or just make it put up extremely racist suggestions
[09:34:06] <companion_cube> :DDDDD
[09:34:14] <quanticle> Like highlighting fried chicken whenever a black person walks by
[09:34:16] <companion_cube> "hey, you, mexican guy! care for some beans and tacos?"
[09:34:25] <quanticle> Curry whenenever an Indian walks by
[09:34:27] <quanticle> Etc

[17:02:00] <Xe> quanticle: thanks! it's a shame that that post was off topic on lobsters
[17:10:09] <wink> riv: that's a diffcult question. if you posit it as "my friend went for the degree and he gave me all he read to read myself" - then not a lot. if you phrase it as "what I could not realistically have learnt?" a bit
[17:10:43] <wink> riv: I kinda regret it, for all the wasted years and because I don't think it was worth the time investment. I can't imagine my regret if I had paid US prices, to be honest.
[17:11:28] <riv> which specific subjects and topics do you think you would not have learned if you just self studied?
[17:11:34] <ngoldbaum> that’s funny, i don’t regret my physics degree, i feel like a learned a ton i would never have learned without the structured classes
[17:11:37] <wink> riv: but on the other hand every now and then quite a few things pop up that I simply remember well enough so that the lightbulb goes off, or I know the phrase and where to look. overall I'd say it depends on the person and how they learn. I am really bad at listening to lectures, so I hated it

[17:12:40] <ngoldbaum> lol no
[17:13:09] <ngoldbaum> but not a lot of call for web physicsing from high schoolers
[17:13:13] <wink> riv: for me personally the stuff I was not naturally interested were kinda good, I think. that would be compilers, in-depth algorithms for databases, and actually a bit of big-o notatioon and algorithm runtimes in general
[17:13:27] <riv> i see!
[17:13:36] <wink> ngoldbaum: I figured that. but I went to uni as an alternative to just continue working and going fulltime, from parttime
[17:14:46] <wink> riv: on the other hand a lot of stuff was a bit useless if you'd be working as a programmer/admin already (imho). all networking for example. my minor subject I could honestly without exaggerating sum up as: give me 3 good books and I would've learned it on my own in one summer break.
[17:15:44] <wink> riv: also if you hadn't heard of OOP and software design, there were some useful things. but again, nothing arcane or "secret", just a solid base, in my uni.
[17:15:47] <riv> networking is always something i feel like I understood much less than i need to
[17:15:58] <ngoldbaum> on the gripping hand a lot of software jobs are gated on dumb trivia that is much easier to absorb in the context of a CS degree than in a cram session going into interviews
[17:16:17] <ngoldbaum> regardless of whether the trivia is important for the job
[17:16:25] <ngoldbaum> i think mostly it’s a cultural screen
[17:17:11] <wink> riv: now, a few caveats. a) I got my diploma (roughly like BSc+MSc) in Germany, I finished in early 2010. b) this was supposed to take 9 semesters, most people needed 10, I needed 13. this was due to 2 major fuckups of the uni, me being a little procrastinating, and working a lot during that time

[17:19:10] <wink> riv: I think I'd never needed to show my paper certificate until after the fact that I'd been hired, but I got a lot of jobs through connections. normal interviews, etc, of course, but I got the original contact by knowing someone there. But this seems to be different for many big corps here. I simply can't comment. I thought it would be a thing to show around, nobody cared tho
[17:19:31] <wink> well, those weren't full time jobs for most of the yeart
[17:19:58] <riv> yeah

[17:22:44] <riv> i would like to know the hardware side better

[17:24:27] <wink> maybe even actually worse, and having learnt to program with JS. who knows?
[17:24:56] <riv> I feel like theoretical cs vs a programming job is /almost/ two completely separate worlds
[17:25:05] <riv> i mean they kind of meet in some places
[17:25:17] <wink> yes and no
[17:25:24] <riv> but you don't get a course on "getting to grips with a giant alien codebase"
[17:25:30] <wink> I think you don't need theroretical CS _at all_, until you need it
[17:25:45] <wink> but if you work in a team one person would be perfectly fine to spot the pain points
[17:26:10] <wink> also in my opinion self-taught people are usually vastly better programmers
[17:26:54] <ngoldbaum> riv: but seriously don’t go to grad school in CS unless you really want to teach or do research
[17:27:20] <ngoldbaum> there are few career choices that so thoroughly limit your lifetime earning power
