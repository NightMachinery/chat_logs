[01:38:25] <CableNinja> er... was it after
[01:38:34] <vinrock> at my first company, my first major task was the NT4 to AD domain migration
[01:38:34] <int0x1C8> so I'm the only one here looking into new techs and methods, given projects I have complete autonomy in coming up with a solution to whatever it is, if it involves cost, so be it, and yada yada
[01:38:42] <CableNinja> idk... I remember we got the first XP computer when I was there, and guess who it went to?
[01:38:46] <CableNinja> THE RECEPTIONIST
[01:38:52] <vinrock> haha
[01:39:01] <camel_case> I barely remember XP
[01:39:03] <vinrock> because she been there for 300 years alrady at that point i assume
[01:39:09] <vinrock> just remember the background
[01:39:11] <CableNinja> not the parts guy who had been begging for a computer because his would shit the bed any time you tried to print
[01:39:15] <vinrock> that stupid green hill
[01:39:16] <camel_case> I spent my childhood on vista and win7
[01:39:18] <CableNinja> no, its because she was family
[01:39:31] <vinrock> my childhood was DOS to Win 3.1
[01:39:32] <camel_case> I loved windows vista
[01:39:47] <CableNinja> it was a company that had a huge family hiding out inside of it, it wasnt owned by the family, but they'd snuck enough people in that it might as well have been
[01:39:48] <int0x1C8> my childhood was 95 to 98 then XP by the time I got to highschool

[01:40:26] <CableNinja> int0x1C8, yeah same, though I also got some 3.1, and there was a very brief interaction with some punchcard systems in elementary school
[01:40:38] <vinrock> i didnt switch because i thought everyone ws being a turbonerd and i wanted to stick with coding because thats where the moneys at
[01:40:39] <vinrock> ugh
[01:40:41] <vinrock> big mistake
[01:40:44] <int0x1C8> kazaa, limewire, xbox modchipping and halo
[01:40:52] <CableNinja> idk how they even had enough punchcard PC games for a whole class of kids
[01:41:01] <CableNinja> or even could afford the systems for them
[01:41:09] <vinrock> i remember when botnets were invented
[01:41:10] <int0x1C8> I vaguely remember NT4
[01:41:19] <CableNinja> poor computer teacher accidentally a whole box of punchcards :(
[01:41:29] <vinrock> everyone in the warez game had unix shells for creating 0-day sites
[01:41:39] <camel_case> My first programming project was with C/C++ and the SDL library. I wanted to make a galaga clone with a dick sprite instead of the space ship, so I could show my classmates on the bus
[01:41:40] <CableNinja> int0x1C8, first professional place had NT3 :S
[01:41:41] <vinrock> eventually someone got the idea to crate a c2 botnet
[01:41:51] <CableNinja> they also were running windows 98 in most places
[01:42:08] <CableNinja> and we had a token ring for the parts inventory system
[01:42:17] <CableNinja> idk why they never replaced that shit, blew my mind
[01:42:25] <int0x1C8> I was sufficiently old enough to have memories from the time when my mom's work was going from NT4 to...
[01:42:35] <CableNinja> rollin out wireless and still having to troubleshoot broken rings
[01:42:48] <int0x1C8> ok now I'm confused I remember my mother's system being NT4, but all the other cubicles had 95 or 98
[01:43:17] <int0x1C8> er no
[01:43:38] <int0x1C8> she had one of those input/monitor switches since she was a project manager and thus had admin creds
[01:44:10] <int0x1C8> anyway one of the systems she used was definitely NT4
[01:44:59] <CableNinja> damn you just reminded me of when I went to work with my mom at a rebar place
[01:45:24] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> No sweetie, that was the RETARD place
[01:45:30] <CableNinja> ...
[01:45:31] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> See, this is why we need to take you back there...
[01:45:39] <CableNinja> all the cad guys had those brick kvm switches under their monitor and A/B switches to go between the dot matrix and plotter

[01:45:40] <int0x1C8> my mom was single so I rode the bus from school to her work and would just hang out in the office until she got done and we went home
[01:46:01] <CableNinja> critamine no, literally, rebar. they made, sold, and built rebar things
[01:46:04] <int0x1C8> that's where it all started for me, wandering this cubicle farm maze, going into an unassigned cubicle turning on the pc
[01:46:08] <int0x1C8> and opening.... notepad

[01:46:22] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> Maybe I'm baked but this hit me hard

[01:47:03] <int0x1C8> and thinking it was amazing but fucking boring
[01:47:20] <CableNinja> just dawned on me where my enjoyment of engineering things started, lol
[01:47:23] <int0x1C8> of course all the PCs there had no games, or the games were locked down
[01:47:38] <int0x1C8> so no solitaire or minesweeper, notepad.exe was my game lol
[01:48:30] <vinrock> back in the day all you had to edit was progman.ini and you could comment out ui elements
[01:48:52] <vinrock> you had to keyboard shortcut the run box, open notepad and edit the file to get the stuff back
[01:48:54] <int0x1C8> yeah she had one of those switches CableNinja except I remember there being multiple physical PCs under her desk

[01:50:03] <CableNinja> there was one 'switchy' thingy she had that was like all the power switches for things in one, kinda seemed like a power strip, but really computer specific

[01:50:57] <int0x1C8> is that the term? I thought KVM was a type of super simple virtual machine to give I/O access to multiple physically connected systems

[01:51:42] <CableNinja> int0x1C8, KVM has multiple inferences
[01:52:00] <CableNinja> but generally KVM means a means of switching between 2 devices I/O
[01:52:12] <int0x1C8> ah, I see now
[01:52:13] <CableNinja> A/B switches for example
[01:52:43] <int0x1C8> there's Kernel Virtual Machine which is what I was thinking of, and KVM for keyboard video mouse
[01:52:51] <CableNinja> I had an A/B at my last job because I kept confusing my keyboards between the two systems I had to use (and both required physical keyboards)
[01:52:57] <CableNinja> right
[01:53:06] <int0x1C8> never knew they had the same name
[01:54:08] <int0x1C8> I'd always just called those 'input switches' or 'peripheral aggregators' or some such
[01:57:32] <int0x1C8> so, question: which of the two is it meaning when, on the front of our dell blade chassis, which has 2 hosts in it, there is a "KVM" button next to the chassis VGA and usb input
[01:57:57] <int0x1C8> that button switches between looking at one of the hosts, or none
[01:58:48] <CableNinja> thats the Keyboard Video Mouse one
[01:59:35] <CableNinja> when using a KVM, you have to plug into those ports specifically, because certain points of the system are inaccessible during boot through the other ports (they havent turned up/been seen yet)
[02:00:13] <CableNinja> the system starts up those usb/vga ports first and makes them accessible; in a 'pre-bios' environment
[02:00:47] <CableNinja> sometimes that isnt the case, and the back works just the same, and they just put those there so you dont have to go fishing in the back
[02:01:08] *** Joins: Gerula (~Gerula@user/gerula)
[02:01:57] <int0x1C8> only the front of the hosts are exposed, they don't have video/usb except for the idrac maint. usb
[02:02:27] <int0x1C8> the back is fully enclosed in the rear of the chassis where all the expansion slots for I/O cards are
[02:02:36] *** Quits: dmang (~dmang@user/dmang) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:02:56] <CableNinja> yeah. really depends on the chassis
[02:03:12] <CableNinja> general rule of thumb is if it says 'kvm' thats where it should go
[02:03:29] <CableNinja> if its not there, then any port will do in a storm

[04:40:31] <Jay-HPWebOS-Ros> yes for the management platform but the consoles were an app launch
[04:41:25] <Jay-HPWebOS-Ros> MVS is terminal sessions, so there were ways to configure to connect in remotely, but for what they were you didn't want to allow that kind of access, as they were 'bulk' tools

[05:49:16] <corn266> fuck me they're too goddamn good
[05:49:36] <int0x1C8> when I found them I was a drummer dude, you have no idea
[05:49:42] <corn266> listening to "L'enfant sauvage" right now
[05:49:47] <corn266> bruh
[05:50:14] <corn266> there's not an instrument in their band that doesn't slap like your grandma
[05:50:19] <corn266> drums
[05:50:22] <corn266> fucking fire
[05:50:43] <corn266> i'm too drunk to remember the rest of the instruments
[05:50:46] <corn266> but fuck
[05:50:47] <int0x1C8> born in winter is my favorite song from that album
[05:50:59] <int0x1C8> possibly my favorite gojira song period
[05:51:33] <corn266> listening
[05:52:01] <int0x1C8> but dude oroborus and vacuity were in my top 5 warm up jam songs
[05:52:25] <int0x1C8> along with dream theater 'honor thy father' and 'panic attack'
[05:52:33] <corn266> legitimately any song from this band is top 5 jams
[05:52:49] <corn266> they're just so goddamn good
[05:53:05] <int0x1C8> I'm talking about songs that I would sit at my kit and warm up playing along to
[05:53:35] <corn266> i may not understand what it takes to be a "warm up song"
[05:53:38] <corn266> but my guy
[05:53:48] <corn266> these are jammers for sure
[05:54:19] <int0x1C8> warm up, get the blood flowing, everything limber y'know
[05:54:47] <corn266> yup. these songs. this band. goddamn.
[05:55:03] <int0x1C8> my warm up songs were always long, very complex rhythmically, and ones you can't help but headbang to while playing
[05:55:36] <int0x1C8> lol hang on lemme show you this, I don't think I've ever linked this here
[05:56:07] <corn266> i'm a bit surprised you found born in winter better that either L'enfant suavage or the axe
[05:56:22] <corn266> it's like, chill and all, but it's not a head  banger imo
[05:56:46] <int0x1C8> the middle section of born in winter is just... just...
[05:56:58] <corn266> i'll re-listen
[05:56:58] <int0x1C8> *chef's kiss*
[05:57:18] <int0x1C8> where it goes from the chill part to the harsher part

[06:07:11] <int0x1C8> gift of guilt and the art of dying are their classic percussion heavy songs, but at the time they were too complex for me to warm up with
[06:07:17] <int0x1C8> more something I'd warm up to
[06:08:36] <corn266> yea, it's kinda a basic guitar song. but goddamn these drums my guy
[06:08:41] <int0x1C8> I only have 3 drum covers on my youtube, then I sold my set to finance a trip to new mexico to visit my friend I hadn't seen since high school
[06:09:12] <corn266> that's pretty nice of you
[06:09:35] <corn266> couldn't say that i'd give up a passion to do the same

[06:10:00] <corn266> okay
[06:10:01] <corn266> kek
[06:10:13] <corn266> i remember the weed heavy trip
[06:10:16] <int0x1C8> at the time I didn't think I'd be giving it up, more like a temp. break until I got a better kit and gear
[06:10:25] <corn266> went to CO and hiked a bunch
[06:10:36] <int0x1C8> but that never happened :(

[06:37:32] <BWMerlin> I am listening to In Flames atm, never heard them before but I am enjoying them so far.

[06:39:38] <int0x1C8> in flames is classic melodic death metal from gothenburg sweden
[06:40:34] <int0x1C8> they evolved later in their careers to what other fans might think is not metal, but what worth is a band that doesn't change and evolve its sound?
[06:41:26] <int0x1C8> if you like their earlier style check out soilwork, insomnium, or dark tranquility
[06:41:42] <int0x1C8> first 2 are my #1 and #2 favorite bands of all time
[06:41:58] <corn266> will do, the later tracks are kinda........ different
[06:42:39] <int0x1C8> every. fucking. album. they put out is better than the last, and no songs are bad. just the right mix of their established sound with a new flavor
[06:43:13] <corn266> you're 100% right
[06:43:27] <corn266> just that the flavour isn't
[06:44:28] <int0x1C8> I mean referring to soilwork and insomnium
[06:44:59] <int0x1C8> in flames kinda went... weird, but still good in its own way

[07:28:57] <xe0n> so dhcp is handing out address from 0.1 - 0.150, but you want to assign 0.151 through a reservation?

[07:31:52] <sd> 02<M​ystic> if im understanding you right, yes
[07:32:13] <xe0n> the word "static" means you're manually setting that ip address on the device. reservation is i'm assigning ip address X to Y device, and it'll get the same lease (ip address) each time it requests an address

[07:34:27] <xe0n> well static implies you're manually setting the ip address on the device
[07:34:39] <xe0n> reservation is a dhcp lease that's reserved for a specific device

[09:18:15] <xe0n> wtf has windows\linux have anything to do with "the new helpdesk is coming along nice"
[09:18:26] <corn266> he's doing a fucking banger job
[09:18:41] <corn266> actually
[09:18:45] <corn266> fuck it
[09:19:36] <corn266> i consneed xe0n.
[09:19:39] <corn266> you win
[09:19:55] <technonerd> cornseeded266
[09:20:08] *** corn266 is now known as cornsneeded266
[09:20:13] <cornsneeded266> it's not taken
[09:21:09] *** cornsneeded266 is now known as corn266
[09:25:32] <BWMerlin> I was just trying to share my small accomplishment and seems I started some kind of war
[09:25:50] <xe0n> no, you're fine :)
[09:27:04] <BWMerlin> And yes, I have some policies and processes in place (documented too) and will expand upon them over time.
[09:29:27] <csws> BWMerlin, what are you using for the ITSM?
[09:30:04] <BWMerlin> GLPI
[09:30:55] <BWMerlin> Still in the process of configuring it.  Will soft launch it in two weeks and iron out any issues and go for a full launch later on.
[09:31:48] <xe0n> what made you pick that one? it's free?
[09:32:31] <BWMerlin> A large part that yes, it was free.  It also had asset and helpdesk in one.
[09:32:43] <riff-IRC> nice
[09:33:18] <BWMerlin> Was unsure what budget if any I would have for a helpdesk so free is a good starting point.  The more I looked into it the more I really liked what I saw.  Did the online trial, and it just got better and better.
[09:33:34] * riff-IRC nods
[09:33:35] <BWMerlin> Also has integration with airwatch which I am keen to checkout.
[09:33:38] <riff-IRC> FOSS?
[09:34:34] <BWMerlin> Yes
[09:34:59] <riff-IRC> Very nice
[09:35:18] <riff-IRC> So that means that if someone so wanted to, they could create an internal fork of it
[09:36:06] <riff-IRC> I've been thinking of forking APCUPSD and making some improvements on it, such as changing the methodology it uses to signal LOBATT
[09:36:14] <BWMerlin> https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi
[09:36:40] <BWMerlin> It is distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2
[09:36:53] <BWMerlin> So yes, if you had the know how you could fork it.
[09:37:38] <riff-IRC> GPLv2, so it can be used in black-box proprietary software if desired
[09:37:59] <BWMerlin> I am not up on my licensing so cannot comment about that.
[09:38:19] <riff-IRC> (re APCUPSD) IDK why it throws LOBATT based on estimated runtime instead of going on battery percentage.
[09:38:55] <riff-IRC> Especially considering that remaining runtime is a variable that is quite possibly inaccurate and subject to change.
[09:39:17] <BWMerlin> Would you have to fork it or could you just contribute to the existing project?
[09:39:44] <BWMerlin> I am not up on source control very much.  The most I have done is fix a few typo's in documentation.
[09:40:36] <riff-IRC> Not sure. There hasn't been a new release of APCUPSD in more than 5 years and I'm wondering if the codebase is that mature or if the developer has moved on from it after close to 20 years.
[09:41:20] <csws> they have PRs from randos in there so I guess glpi is open to third party contributors
[09:41:29] <xe0n> BWMerlin: my suggestion - before you launch anything, you need to sit with all the department heads and tailor the itsm to the business, this is usually the longest part in implementing a good itsm
[09:41:36] <csws> https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/blob/9.5/bugfixes/CONTRIBUTING.md
[09:42:01] <riff-IRC> IIRC, the last updates to APCUPSD consisted of flattening some bugs related to the MODBUS protocol and stripping away some outdated code.
[09:42:13] <xe0n> otherwise you're going to just launch a ticket system and be continually fussing with it to make it work, or people may find a reason not to use it for XYZ reasons lol
[09:42:34] <xe0n> this is why a good ITSM usually costs money and time to implement, most of the time you get professional services from the vendor to assist in customisations etc
[09:42:35] <xe0n> workflows
[09:42:38] <xe0n> approvals etc
[09:42:48] <csws> he's edu IT iirc
[09:42:50] <xe0n> its an entire pipeline to be used throughout the business, not just asset tracking and a ticket system
[09:42:53] <csws> so I'd look into whether it can suit custom fields
[09:42:56] <xe0n> sure...its still a business.
[09:42:57] <csws> like classroom # maybe
[09:43:35] <csws> having a thing where the teacher can specify their next free time would be kinda cool
[09:43:59] <csws> I used to do edu helpdesk shit and organising a time to call was always annoying
[09:44:18] <A-KO> howdy
[09:44:20] <A-KO> what's up xe0n?
[09:44:26] <csws> another question would be whether students use this thing and how complicated is the self serve then
[09:44:30] <csws> and does it work on tehir shitty ipads lol
[09:45:46] <csws> does it do automation as well?
[09:46:04] <xe0n> shitty ipads? wtf
[09:46:06] <csws> gosh
[09:46:12] <csws> they're still on freenode
[09:46:13] <xe0n> nothing wrong with ipads lol
[09:46:13] <csws> CRINGE
[09:46:39] <xe0n> A-KO!
[09:46:46] <xe0n> nada
[09:46:48] <xe0n> you?
[09:47:11] <riff-IRC> yep, nailed it- MODBUS bugsquashing and the deprecation of the old MASTER/SLAVE networking mode, IIRC
[09:49:04] <BWMerlin> Head office has service now which they expect staff and students to use (to be fair they also realise the service now is hella confusing and are trying to do something about that)
[09:49:24] <csws> they must've really screwed up their snow instance
[09:49:38] <csws> tbh I've always found snow pretty easy to use
[09:49:45] <BWMerlin> Ideally things will be a simple email ingestion, assign to tech and user, email back and forth and done.  Things like approvals etc will come with time.
[09:49:54] <xe0n> snow isn't bad
[09:49:59] <xe0n> it means they haven't configured it correctly lol
[09:50:16] <csws> HP SM9 makes snow look amazing lol
[09:50:22] <csws> ITSM software is just.. :(
[09:50:29] <BWMerlin> That is the story of their entire existence, nothing is done well.
[09:50:30] <xe0n> yeah no email ingestion should be a second option, you want a portal entry
[09:50:32] <xe0n> so they fill specific things out
[09:50:38] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> I feel like I wanna be pedantic right now. Windows 11 requirements are more than reasonable.
[09:50:43] <xe0n> not just send some lame email with only a subject, or a one liner which makes you have to read between the lines
[09:50:45] <csws> e-mails back and forth make work notes unreadable on snow
[09:50:54] <csws> all the work notes end up cluttered with signature lines and shit
[09:51:10] <xe0n> yeah, portal entry is the way
[09:51:19] <xe0n> no one is going to find ticket stubs in their email lol
[09:51:19] <csws> + you want automation
[09:51:38] <BWMerlin> GLPI does have web portal.  I have it tied to AD but I don't think I have done it correctly so will need to look into that during soft launch.
[09:51:43] <csws> no sense wasting time everytime someone wants a DHCP reservation for a printer
[09:51:59] <csws> soo
[09:52:00] <xe0n> ehh i dont think students\teachers will be requesting that lol
[09:52:13] <csws> have you checked in with head office?
[09:52:15] <xe0n> yeah BWMerlin you're weeks away from even introducing it to anyone, sounds like you've got a bit more work ahead
[09:52:19] <csws> like.. told them you're setting this up? lol
[09:52:23] <A-KO> xe0n: CVE-2021-1675? :d
[09:52:24] <A-KO> :D
[09:52:28] <A-KO> https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/06/30/cve-2021-1675-printnightmare-patch-does-not-remediate-vulnerability/
[09:52:29] <xe0n> just saying, i've rolled out an itsm once or twice, anddddd it takes _time_
[09:52:36] <A-KO> oh boy
[09:52:41] <A-KO> you're on my topic, but I'll spare you the thought
[09:52:43] <A-KO> :D
[09:52:47] <xe0n> LOL yeah CVE
[09:52:50] <A-KO> "things take time"
[09:52:56] <A-KO> that's a hard sell to people I know, for some reason.
[09:53:29] <BWMerlin> I have not officially told them but I do not care for their opinion, they exist to make life difficult and most schools do what ever they can to not deal with head office.
[09:53:36] * csws begins reading
[09:53:49] * csws screams
[09:53:52] <xe0n> LOL!
[09:53:53] <A-KO> xe0n: Appears that fully patched is still vulnerable
[09:53:58] <xe0n> yeah
[09:54:00] <xe0n> separate CVE
[09:54:00] <xe0n> lol
[09:54:36] <xe0n> there's some work arounds going around
[09:54:44] <xe0n> but also i know the people at my place are misunderstanding the issues
[09:54:47] <xe0n> but i aint getting involved :P
[09:56:20] <A-KO> lol
[09:56:24] <A-KO> I killed print spooler
[09:56:25] <A-KO> said fuck it
[09:56:34] <A-KO> problem solved
[09:56:39] <A-KO> no print spooler? no problem
[09:56:39] <csws> A-KO, lol talking with a guy about this, MS sent him an e-mail saying to install patches
[09:56:43] <xe0n> lol yeah, i disable it on dcs anyway :X
[09:56:45] <csws> so apparently they haven't read that news
[09:56:53] <xe0n> csws: there's two CVEs
[09:57:03] <xe0n> and the email is about the first one
[09:57:05] <xe0n> not the one ^
[09:57:22] <xe0n> one was patched, another wasn't
[09:57:26] <BWMerlin> Reading it seems like if you run core then you should be fine
[09:57:27] <A-KO> does the second one have a CVE yet?
[09:57:37] <csws> Is the subject "Incomplete fix for CVE-2021-1675 (Print Spooler)"?
[09:57:38] <A-KO> or is it "oh fuck we found this and we need to reserve a CVE"?
[09:57:39] <csws> that's the one he got
[09:57:45] <riff-IRC> backups time, cya l8r
[09:57:48] <xe0n> there's two printer things going
[09:57:56] <A-KO> CVE-2021-1675 is one CVE ; I don't think the other one has a numbver yet
[09:58:10] <xe0n> correct

[09:58:28] <A-KO> CVE-2021-1675 is a big one ; but it seems that during the POC code writing to exploit that, they inadvertently found another vulnerability
[09:58:31] <xe0n> https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/public-windows-printnightmare-0-day-exploit-allows-domain-takeover/
[09:58:33] <A-KO> that's similar, and related
[09:59:38] <xe0n> BWMerlin: it's that the spooler is disabled by default on core, but if someone needs a print server on their dc that happens to run core, well they're bust too.
[09:59:52] <xe0n> smbs with one box which does all things, well...
[09:59:53] <xe0n> lol
[09:59:55] <BWMerlin> Ah okay
[10:00:34] <xe0n> A-KO: another workaround is changing the ACLs on the spooler loll
[10:00:34] <BWMerlin> I thought it was the GUI part that made it vulnerable.  I might spin up my next servers without GUI, WAC is pretty dam nice.
[10:00:41] <A-KO> lol xe0n
[10:00:44] <A-KO> that works I guess?
[10:00:57] <A-KO> I am going 100% no GUI on all new builds

[10:01:24] <xe0n> well core is great, but its nice to have central management, else... some people might find it hard to manage
[10:01:28] <xe0n> + some stuff still requires gui
[10:01:34] <xe0n> so it's on a per server\service setting
[10:01:42] <A-KO> NPS still requires a gui
[10:01:46] <xe0n> yup
[10:01:51] <A-KO> Exchange 2016 requires a GUI, 2019 does not
[10:01:52] <xe0n> ADFS
[10:02:00] <A-KO> I actually did something silly with ADFS
[10:02:03] <xe0n> primary server needs gui, secondary servers core 
[10:02:05] <A-KO> I stood up 3 ADFS servers, with one being "hidden"
[10:02:09] <A-KO> SQL-backed
[10:02:24] <csws> lol what
[10:02:31] <csws> like as a hot standby?
[10:02:35] <A-KO> Servers 1 & 2 (the actual ADFS servers) are core, but there's a hidden non-authing/LB ADFS server with GUI for the management tools
[10:02:41] <csws> oh
[10:02:41] <xe0n> you tried editing claims in powershell? lol!
[10:02:43] <xe0n> yeah...
[10:02:59] <A-KO> so once I get all of my workflows in code, the management server will go away
[10:03:12] <xe0n> yeah nah, i'll stick to having a management box around for that one
[10:03:12] <A-KO> it's "technically" an ADFS server itself ; but isn't in the rotation and has the firewall on
[10:03:19] <xe0n> yeah...
[10:03:52] <BWMerlin> Don't all your servers have the firewall on?
[10:03:58] <A-KO> LOL
[10:04:09] <A-KO> lots of stuff is still open even with FWs on man :P
[10:04:11] <A-KO> that's how it works
[10:04:17] <A-KO> RPC is a hard one to kill on some systems, i.e. CAs and DCs
[10:04:27] <xe0n> he's referring to the edge firewall BWMerlin
[10:04:28] <A-KO> since RPC is the mechanism used for those functions
[10:04:35] <A-KO> no I'm referring to host also
[10:04:37] <A-KO> both edge and host
[10:04:42] <xe0n> yes...
[10:04:48] <A-KO> don't want someone to discover the one server can do ADFS either :P lol
[10:04:50] <A-KO> I don't want them going there
[10:05:16] <A-KO> I have a busy work weekend
[10:05:27] <xe0n> why work on the weekend lol
[10:05:36] <xe0n> dont say you have too
[10:05:37] <xe0n> you dont
[10:05:39] <xe0n> its your choice.
[10:05:40] <A-KO> uhm

[10:12:59] <BWMerlin> Why so long?
[10:13:44] <BWMerlin> Where I work firewall changes are done daily but only after hours so if a change doesn't work you have to wait till the following night for the adjustment to be made
[10:14:02] <A-KO> because they committed to firewall rules that were 1:1, intra-VLAN ; and required people to fill out firewall spreadsheets to get any and all service communication talking to each other across VLANs. And you needed to explain why. And they asked the entire IT organization to submit firewall changes like that.
[10:14:56] <A-KO> anyways, I need a massive break after today
[10:15:02] <A-KO> next day or two is dealing with fucking CVE shit
[10:15:36] <xe0n> yeah, there's a process to follow pretty much

[23:47:43] <signofzeta> I came across an Apple Newton back in college.  Totally obsolete, but it worked fairly well.
[23:48:07] <signofzeta> I have a downloaded copy of Windows 2.01 at work.  Why?  *shrug*

[23:53:41] <signalblue> LOL
[23:53:55] <signalblue> Does Win 2.01 even work in VM's?
[23:54:23] <signofzeta> I believe so, but not well.
[23:54:30] <signofzeta> Windows 1 does not, because it didn't support PS/2 mice yet.
[23:54:57] <signalblue> Hyper-V... Win2.01 probably not going to work well
[23:55:01] <signalblue> if at all
[23:55:14] * gibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[23:55:16] <signalblue> because older OSes are dependant on clock speed
[23:57:35] <signofzeta> True.  I think DOSbox or VirtualBox would be better for that.
[23:57:56] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Was gonna say DOSBox
[23:57:56] <signalblue> I don't really like VBox for some reason
[23:58:16] <signofzeta> you might need something like DOSIDLE to keep it from using all the host CPU, though, but that's no big deal.
[23:58:24] <UDK450> Hey all, just setup a VPS the other day and I've got a few sites configured on it (grafana and firefly-iii) behind nginx. Additionally, I've got both of these sites proxied via CloudFlare as well. I've got a rule in UFW to allow access to any port on my server from my home network IP, but since CloudFlare proxies things, it seems as if that fails. 
[23:58:52] <signofzeta> UDK450: correct.  Cloudflare is proxying it.  You'll have to set up that rule in Cloudflare, not on the destination server.
[23:59:06] <UDK450> Do I just need to let every IP from Cloudflare (https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/ips) have access to my system?
[23:59:10] <UDK450> Ohh, okay.
