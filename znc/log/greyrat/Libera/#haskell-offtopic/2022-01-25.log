[12:03:23] <tomsmeding> I remember a while ago, when still fog, they wanted some kind of weird mutable array like thing, and I think they felt that needed some complex type-based setup or something. Then I wrote this for them and they were totally happy: https://gist.github.com/fog-hs/397316dd2667815f3dea66635f72e1f5
[12:03:51] <tomsmeding> which is just an STArray with a phantom type variable for the length
[12:04:09] <tomsmeding> what they wanted was actually quite simple
[12:04:49] <dminuoso> The bizarre thing is, the code they present continuously indicates they have a very thorough understanding of advanced type tricks.
[12:04:52] * tomsmeding is interested what the "faster" version would be, given the description he put on the gist
[12:05:02] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: but _only_ that
[12:05:12] <tomsmeding> don't really grasp an STArray, for example
[12:05:52] <tomsmeding> but yeah I remember that as well, being fully blown away with the type tricks they were doing
[12:06:34] <dminuoso> And yet the conversion makes you think you're facing a 2 week Haskell beginner at types.
[12:07:07] <dminuoso> But the language is so interleaved with complicated bits, and there is some very spongy coherence to the discussion..
[12:08:02] <dminuoso> For a while I pondered whether fog could be someones GPT-3 experiment of creating a pronounced Haskell conversation partner..
[12:08:45] <tomsmeding> then you saw the code?
[12:09:04] <dminuoso> fogs code you mean?
[12:09:09] <tomsmeding> yeah
[12:09:32] <dminuoso> I saw plenty before
[12:10:01] <dminuoso> Maybe we have an odd case of a brilliantly smart person who is simply not a programmer, and who is really struggling with Haskell
[12:10:12] <dminuoso> This is my alternate hypothesis.
[12:10:58] <tomsmeding> programmers tend to be people who do stuff logically, instead of by association; maybe this is an association-based programmer
[12:11:08] <tomsmeding> learning type tricks by osmosis
[12:11:13] <dminuoso> Im nearly convinced they are not a programmer by trade or hobby
[12:11:24] <tomsmeding> not by hobby either?
[12:11:28] <dminuoso> As a curiosity at most.
[12:11:30] <tomsmeding> they managed to get this far
[12:11:42] <dminuoso> Let's assume we are dealing with an honest person
[12:11:49] <dminuoso> They did admit yesterday that Haskell was their first language.
[12:12:10] <tomsmeding> I read that statement differently
[12:12:22] <tomsmeding> "sorry, i kind of assume things like that are obvious -- haskell being my first language"
[12:12:25] <tomsmeding> as in, mother tongue
[12:12:34] <dminuoso> Mmm
[12:12:59] <tomsmeding> I mean, that's clearly a jest, but then one that anybody could make
[12:13:31] <dminuoso> I read that statement differentloy
[12:13:45] <dminuoso> The thing is, until now I have not been demonstrated any practical code or examples.
[12:13:54] <dminuoso> No example of "here Im trying to fetch something from a server"
[12:14:03] <dminuoso> Over the past 2 years, it's all been abstract random curiosities
[12:14:23] <tomsmeding> tbh that could've been me over high school
[12:14:28] <tomsmeding> though not in haskell at the time
[12:14:48] <tomsmeding> I don't know how many mandelbrot sets I rendered, and how many other random things I did
[12:15:04] <dminuoso> And the lack of precision in the language or even lack of examples leads me to think, that they could perhaps be some mathematician or physician, who is spending their free time in filling mental capacities by randomly exploring Haskell
[12:15:20] <tomsmeding> it made me know C-with-classes (C++--) well enough to perform decently in a programming competition :p
[12:15:36] <tomsmeding> right
[12:15:41] <tomsmeding> could be right about that
[12:17:31] <[exa]> tomsmeding: they wanted the polymorphic mutable array on type level btw
[12:17:48] <tomsmeding> I think geekosaur hit the nail on the heada a few months back (looking through logs)
[12:17:49] <[exa]> (iirc)
[12:18:00] <tomsmeding> .. *  geekosaur was at one point wondering if what they really wanted was a comonadic structure of some variety
[12:18:06] <tomsmeding> .. geekosaur but it was so hard to tellâ€¦
[12:18:46] <tomsmeding> [exa]: oh really? I might not have been familiar enough with type-level programming at all at that point to even see that as a possibility :p
[12:18:54] <dminuoso> But at the end I dont mind them in the channel at all. They are not disturbing, and it's definitely not troll level.
[12:19:16] <[exa]> it might be nice to ask them to pastebin the thoughts to avoid flood
[12:19:47] <[exa]> one time the message frequency was competing with matrix disconnects
[12:20:34] <tomsmeding> just the first ~20 messages on this day here https://ircbrowse.tomsmeding.com/day/lchaskell/2021/11/01
[12:27:38] <[exa]> ah that was this thing
[12:29:57] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: By the way, the new log UI is quite annoying. :p
[12:30:02] <dminuoso> The order is all wrong, and the pagination is really hurtful.
[12:30:34] <dminuoso> Oh, did pagination go away?
[12:30:47] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: I'm just sending links to calendar days, the pagination view is still there
[12:30:57] <tomsmeding> and is the order all wrong? Where?
[12:31:13] <dminuoso> https://ircbrowse.tomsmeding.com/browse/lchaskell
[12:31:22] <dminuoso> Im going to argue this should be reversed. :p
[12:31:28] <tomsmeding> and with "new log UI", what's "new"? Since it moved to a different server (UI didn't change?), or since ircbrowse instead of clog?
[12:31:36] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: lol
[12:31:38] <dminuoso> Since ircbrowse instead of clog
[12:31:41] <tomsmeding> right

[12:35:17] <[exa]> it's roughly the same kind of slow here too, on expanding

[12:37:46] <[exa]> dminuoso: what delays you see?
[12:37:47] <tomsmeding> ok the root GET / takes longer to open
[12:37:50] <dminuoso> Yes.
[12:37:53] <tomsmeding> but then scrolling is fine
[12:38:07] <dminuoso> [exa]: Some 10-20 seconds on expanding, and then scrolling is nearly unresponsive,
[12:38:10] <[exa]> GET / takes slightly less time here than e.g. nexthop-group-id
[12:38:46] <[exa]> okay that's not a good timing, you on M1 right? :D
[12:39:10] <tomsmeding> opening 'GET /' takes roughly 2.5 seconds in ff here and 2 seconds in chromium (hand-counted, not very accurate)
[12:39:15] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: _wow_

[16:41:42] <dminuoso> If solar energy was cheaper to do than coal for base loads, then a trend would have started replacing coal and nuclear power plants with solar.
[16:41:46] <dminuoso> But it's not.
[16:42:55] <dminuoso> To cover base loads, you need incredibly huge energy storage, which is a) expensive to build, b) necessitates huge spaces to do (if we're pumping water for example), or absurdly amounts of resources (for building patteries), and we also have unbelievably high conversion losses.
[16:43:19] <dminuoso> And even then, base loads have self regulation mechanisms you only get from very large rotation masses like turbines in power plants
[16:43:31] <dminuoso> (self regulation to provide stable frequencies in our AC networks)

[16:44:39] <dminuoso> If the AC frequency starts to fluctuate, you usually have cascading outages to the point where your power network fragments and goes down on national or larger scales.
[16:44:52] <geekosaur> and then there's peak loads. I've heard how England has unique power plant issues from all the electric kettles firing off at 17:00 :)
[16:45:09] <dminuoso> geekosaur: Yes, those cause frequency flutations. :)
[16:47:49] <dminuoso> My brother in law is currently involved in research about moving control of supermarket freezers to power providers, such that power providers can temporarily shut off and on fridges and freezers on a national scale if there's sudden changes in the network

[16:57:58] <kuribas> dminuoso: you're talking about energy storage, which is a different problem.
[16:59:02] <dminuoso> When talking solar power plants, you are inevitably talking about energy storage.
[16:59:22] <dminuoso> Pretending you dont need storage for a solar power plant is very naive
[16:59:39] <kuribas> there are ways to solve this, for example to run large loads only during peak hours.

[17:00:35] <dminuoso> How do you do that with a solar plant if its cloudy?
[17:01:18] <dminuoso> Every solar plant you add without energy storage will increase AC frequency fluctuations unless you never have the solar power plant feed.
[17:01:46] <kuribas> What does frequency have to do with energy yield?
[17:02:02] <kuribas> Frequency conversion is done by inverters.
[17:02:12] <dminuoso> This is an AC circuit.
[17:02:18] <dminuoso> Or well, a network.
[17:02:45] *** Joins: raehik (~raehik@cpc95906-rdng25-2-0-cust156.15-3.cable.virginm.net)
[17:04:01] <dminuoso> If the overall load goes down, the frequency goes down
[17:04:16] <dminuoso> If the overall load goes up, the frequency goes up
[17:04:23] <dminuoso> Similarly, if the yield goes up, the frequency goes down
[17:04:24] <kuribas> It doesn't.  Frequency stays the same.
[17:04:34] <dminuoso> Well I cant have a conversation with if you dont have AC basics.
[17:05:29] <dminuoso> Feel free to do research on your own and convince yourself of this.
[17:06:39] <kuribas> uh, inverters provide a stable frequency.
[17:06:41] <geekosaur> kuribas, I think the inverters we're familiar with don't scale to this
[17:06:53] <kuribas> Scale to what?
[17:06:57] <dminuoso> kuribas: AC on these scales is not produced by inverters.
[17:07:28] <kuribas> how else do you turn solar DC into AC?
[17:08:01] <dminuoso> kuribas: The thing is, what you propose works if you have no rotating masses producing electricity in your network
[17:08:10] <dminuoso> Which leads to another research of micro networks
[17:08:37] <dminuoso> But as soon as we're talking about a national grid in which you have coal, gas, water and nuclear plants all with big rotating engines, frequency is directly tied to load.
[17:08:41] <dminuoso> and yield
[17:08:56] <kuribas> But we're talking about solar.
[17:09:09] <geekosaur> you do not have a national solar network
[17:09:17] <geekosaur> not all at once
[17:10:16] <geekosaur> and even if there is a big push to immediately go solar on a national scale, things like water-powered systems will probably continue to be used
[17:10:57] <dminuoso> Incidentally, if you lack all these extremely heavy rotating masses, you lack voltage stability.
[17:11:14] <geekosaur> and Bad Things happen if they don't all sync to a fixed frequency
[17:11:27] <geekosaur> (like varying voltage, yes)
[17:11:44] <dminuoso> If memory serves right, wind plants produce energy something to the third of wind speed, meaning small variances cause huge differences in yield
[17:11:50] <dminuoso> Which means it's notoriously unstable
[17:12:02] <dminuoso> Solar is a bit less so, but sudden cloud formations can also cause these issues
[17:12:15] <dminuoso> So you absolutely need energy storage 
[17:12:37] <dminuoso> It's why every self-sustaining house keeps batteries.
[17:13:00] <__monty__> Why does rotation cause more stable voltages?
[17:13:30] <dminuoso> __monty__: Because these turbines weigh many hundreds tons of metal, spinning at 50 rotations per second.
[17:13:35] <dminuoso> That gives you so much momentum
[17:13:53] <geekosaur> because it stabilizes the frequency, and from there wave addition tells you what voltage peaks you get
[17:14:28] <kuribas> geekosaur: yes, solar plants are required to sync to the grid.
[17:15:03] <dminuoso> kuribas: okay, so at that point whatever they put into the network directly affects all other power plants.
[17:15:08] <geekosaur> you're still left with the fact that inverters *don't scale* to the amount of power they put out
[17:15:36] <geekosaur> s/they/these plants/
[17:15:38] <kuribas> I believe they do.  Or the mppt does that.
[17:15:41] <dminuoso> kuribas: So if your power plant changes the yield load, it will affect the rotation speed of all turbines connected to that grid.
[17:15:47] <dminuoso> Which means the AC frequency changes
[17:16:01] <dminuoso> And then you're hosed.
[17:16:44] <kuribas> dminuoso: sounds like a load of BS to me.  Do you have a link to an article?
[17:16:54] <geekosaur> sigh
[17:17:20] <dminuoso> kuribas: Traditional power plants are synchronous generators.
[17:17:22] <dminuoso> Is that enough?
[17:17:41] <geekosaur> I grant that I don't have any experience with grid-scale systems, but I have enough of an EE background to understand what dminuoso is saying
[17:18:13] <kuribas> dminuoso: nope, we're talking about solar.
[17:18:29] <dminuoso> kuribas: Yes, and your solar power plant feeds into.. what?
[17:18:30] <geekosaur> (my abortive college degree was in EE)
[17:18:40] <dminuoso> kuribas: Does it feed into say the German national electrical grid?
[17:18:44] <kuribas> geekosaur: fine, show me an article.  I work in solar, and it's the first I hear about it.
[17:19:15] <dminuoso> https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/2641/how-does-load-affect-frequency-on-the-power-grid
[17:19:30] <dminuoso> Feel free to do some additional research yourself, I just skimmed the answers for whether they look alright
[17:19:35] <dminuoso> So no promise these are quality responses.
[17:19:55] <geekosaur> solar at what scale? house scale? what you say is correct. enough power to make a dent in a power grid? start listening now already
[17:20:03] <kuribas> dminuoso: that answer even explicitly says it's not about solr.
[17:20:05] <kuribas> solar.
[17:20:07] <dminuoso> kuribas: Again,.
[17:20:14] <dminuoso> kuribas: What does your solar power plant feed into?
[17:20:19] <dminuoso> Does it feed into a big electrical grid?
[17:20:28] <kuribas> some do.
[17:20:31] <dminuoso> Okay.
[17:20:34] <dminuoso> So assume the one we're talking about does.
[17:20:39] <dminuoso> That same grid has other power plants too.
[17:20:49] <kuribas> one I visited send all its power to a factory.
[17:20:50] <dminuoso> The ones with big rotating turbines - synchronous generators.
[17:21:00] <kuribas> But I still would presume the AC voltage is stable.
[17:21:11] <dminuoso> kuribas: And how do you do voltage stabilization when a cloud pops up?
[17:21:35] <dminuoso> Or does the fabric output match the solar energy output?
[17:21:42] <dminuoso> It's either that, or you need energy storage.
[17:21:43] <polyphem> grid is a dynamic capacity => frequency is a function of capacity  , right ?
[17:21:54] <dminuoso> And if you feed into an electric grid, you need energy storage to avoid frequency changes
[17:22:21] <dminuoso> polyphem: In big grids frequency can be thought of as the ratio between load and yield.
[17:22:41] <dminuoso> This is by the way how you, yourself at home, can detect power plant outages
[17:22:51] <dminuoso> Just do long time measurements of the AC frequency in the outlet
[17:23:23] <dminuoso> Just do long time measurements of the AC frequency in the outlet.
[17:23:26] <dminuoso> Errr sorry
[17:23:45] <dminuoso> Usually what you can detect best is nuclear power plants, because from time to time these tend to do emergency shut down procedures for safety
[17:23:57] <dminuoso> And that can cause small sudden dents in the frequency
[17:24:22] <dminuoso> Also in Europe you can see hourly changes because energy is traded across EU borders in hour packages
[17:25:47] <kuribas> dminuoso: we're getting into a different discussion.  Your claim was: "Every solar plant you add without energy storage will increase AC frequency fluctuations unless you never have the solar power plant feed."
[17:26:09] <kuribas> dminuoso: The article you linked does not say any of that.
[17:26:09] * geekosaur kinda wishes he had had a kill-a-watt back when he'd lived within a few miles of the perry plant
[17:26:24] <kuribas> It's talking about generators.
[17:26:48] <kuribas> inverters use a feedback loop to keep the frequency in sync with the grid.

[17:27:22] <dminuoso> kuribas: Listen to what Im saying.
[17:27:33] <dminuoso> kuribas: The energy you pump into the grid affects everything else.
[17:27:53] <dminuoso> Until a few minutes ago, you weren't talking about some "solar power plant dedicated to a factory"
[17:27:57] <dminuoso> But even then you likely have energy storage.
[17:28:06] <dminuoso> The energy storage isnt necessarily directly colocated with the power plant mind you
[17:28:07] <dminuoso> But roughly:
[17:28:19] <dminuoso> For every solar plant you add to a national grid, you need additional frequency regulation mechanisms.
[17:28:24] <dminuoso> And these are almost universally: energy storages.
[17:28:45] <kuribas> There are ways to solve this.  Like making the demand fit the capacity.
[17:28:59] <dminuoso> That's unreasonable for most use cases.
[17:29:18] <geekosaur> motors depend on the grid frequency, you can't swap them out to fit the capacity
[17:29:23] <dminuoso> In a factory dedicated plant: It's likely unfeasible to have a factory's production schedule depend on the solar output
[17:29:38] <geekosaur> and you *can* burn them out by making the frequency mismatch their design
[17:29:40] <dminuoso> In a national grid: How can you control at large scale what consumers do
[17:29:50] <dminuoso> And that brings us back to what I mentioned earlier about the Borg
[17:30:35] <dminuoso> Nextly, usually you separate these frequency stabilization mechanisms into three categories
[17:30:39] <dminuoso> Primary, secondary and tertiary
[17:30:46] <dminuoso> Roughly they correspond to response times
[17:31:01] <dminuoso> Primary stabilization occurs in under or above a second
[17:31:32] <dminuoso> The whole business is utterly complicated.
[17:32:42] <dminuoso> kuribas: Just to put it into perspective: In 2006 the Meyer dockyard produced out a very large ship. So make the ship traverse the canal, they had to cut a relatively minor power line.
[17:32:58] <dminuoso> The documented load capacities of the neighboring power line the load went through was incorrect.
[17:33:03] <kuribas> geekosaur: it can be interesting for a factory if it makes the energy cheaper.
[17:33:12] <kuribas> geekosaur: that company I saw was a metal smelter.
[17:33:58] <dminuoso> kuribas: This whole story proceeds with small frequency fluctuations that would turn large portions of Germany, Beglium, France, Spain, Austria and Italy black for nearly 2 hours.
[17:34:12] <dminuoso> And for over 2 days the european interconnected electrical grid was split into 3 sub grids
[17:34:19] <dminuoso> With various intermediate outages all over Europe
[17:34:21] <dminuoso> For 2 days.
[17:34:23] <kuribas> dminuoso: sure, I just don't see the link with solar.
[17:34:33] <kuribas> dminuoso: And you still didn't provide me with an article...
[17:34:43] <geekosaur> because throwi8ng solar into that grid even with feedback could cause the same thing
[17:34:54] <geekosaur> adding energy is no better than removing it
[17:35:08] <dminuoso> kuribas: How good is your German?
[17:35:18] <kuribas> dminuoso: okish?
[17:35:27] <dminuoso> kuribas: https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7323-wie_man_einen_blackout_verursacht#t=685
[17:36:17] <kuribas> geekosaur: yeah, that's why solar power is regulated, so it doesn't add more energy than needed.
[17:36:37] <kuribas> So I'd say solar energy actually helps stabilising the grid.
[17:36:44] <dminuoso> kuribas: Except that's not true.
[17:36:51] <dminuoso> Let's put that hypothesis to the test:"
[17:37:01] <dminuoso> Let's assume for a second your statement is entirely correct.
[17:37:08] <dminuoso> 15:06:17    kuribas | geekosaur: yeah, that's why solar power is regulated, so it doesn't add more energy than needed.
[17:37:14] <dminuoso> What happens on a cloudy day?
[17:37:18] <dminuoso> You dont add the necessary energy
[17:37:23] <dminuoso> But where does it come from now?
[17:37:32] <janus> nuclear power
[17:37:43] <dminuoso> Nuclear power plants cant be turned off and on at will
[17:38:05] <dminuoso> A turned off reactor takes up to 12 hours before it can yield electricity into the grid.
[17:38:18] <dminuoso> So if there's sudden cloud formations, a nuclear power plant cant help you
[17:38:28] <dminuoso> Coal plants can take up to 2 days if they are shut down
[17:38:34] <kuribas> literally from what you linked: "For large grids the presence of many generators and a large distributed load makes frequency management easier because any given load is a much smaller percentage of the combined capacity. For smaller grids, there will be a much larger fluctuation in capacity as delays in matching power supplied are harder to manage when the loads represent a relatively larger percentage of the 
[17:38:38] <geekosaur> solar energy isn't steady enough to provide stabilization, especially when grid stability depends on the amount of energy fed into the grid
[17:38:43] <dminuoso> Secondly, how do you even antipicate how much solar power will be produced?
[17:38:49] <geekosaur> this is why you need energy storage
[17:38:55] <dminuoso> because you need to reduce the yield of all other things in advance, matching to what you expect to produce
[17:39:05] <dminuoso> kuribas: Yes, that's definitely correct.
[17:39:24] <dminuoso> kuribas: but for every bit of non-rotating mass you add that holds less true
[17:39:27] <dminuoso> See what Im getting at?
[17:39:40] <dminuoso> It only works precisely *because* we have mostly just rotating masses in the grid.
[17:39:51] <dminuoso> The less rotating mass you have, the more its influencable and the less stable it gets.
[17:39:59] <dminuoso> Unless you had none, of course
[17:40:01] <dminuoso> It's not a linear curve
[17:40:12] <dminuoso> But if you had none, you would have voltage problems then./
[17:40:54] <kuribas> I am ending this discussion, as you seem to ignore how inverters work.
[17:41:03] <dminuoso> Im not ignoring how inverters work
[17:41:12] <dminuoso> Im saying they have no relevance
[17:41:35] <dminuoso> The point is not about what the solar plant produces, but what happens when it doesnt produce into the grid
[17:41:58] <dminuoso> Because we still have rotating masses, we have AC fluctuations how unless you can rapidly compensate for the sudden lack of your solar plant
[17:42:35] <dminuoso> The only way to rapidly (within minutes) produce additional power, is if you have power storages like batteries or say PHES
[17:43:08] <dminuoso> PHES being the most attractive option, but you have a poor relation. The larger you build your PHES, the larger the rotating mass of its turbines gets, which increases delays how rapidly this can react.
[17:43:48] <dminuoso> At the end the only way to reasonably have renewable energies is by not building large national electric grids.
[17:43:55] <dminuoso> Making smaller micro grids
[17:44:09] <dminuoso> Which is an entire paradigm change
[17:44:56] <dminuoso> kuribas: The thing you might not appreciate, is that PHES (which is currently the main way to counteract destabilization of solar and wind) is operated completely separately.
[17:45:13] <dminuoso> So the need for additional power storage might not be obvious to you, since it's "someone elses problem"

[18:00:57] <kuribas> "There is a myth that says renewable energy produces instability on electrical grids and that we need conventional generation to compensate it," said Gabriel Ortiz Mercado, an asset manager at First Solar, which developed and operates a 141-MW, thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solar power plant in the Atacama named Luz del Norte. 
[18:01:15] <dminuoso> Just like Netherland transports most their dung to Germany, since Germany has little regulation and no liability about tossing arbitrary amounts of dung onto our fields..
[18:01:38] <dminuoso> kuribas: Im not saying we need conventional generation to compensate it.
[18:02:09] <dminuoso> But Id have to read details about his claim
[18:03:04] <dminuoso> The simple fact remains: On a cloudy day you are not able to match expected supply.
[18:04:04] <dminuoso> And both for traditional grids (frequency drop) and pure solar grids (voltage drops), you need to handle the fact that suddenly a cloud moves over your power plant.
[18:04:12] <dminuoso> Demand wont suddenly go down, unless you can control it.
[18:04:27] <dminuoso> Which, for the third time, brings us back to what I mentioned earlier about the Borg collective
[18:05:07] <kuribas> There is a lot of shared interest in coordination grid production.
[18:05:27] <dminuoso> kuribas: Sure. It's just that for *production*, renewables are hard to control on demand.
[18:05:43] <dminuoso> At the same time you have potential overproduction
[18:05:57] <dminuoso> Say because you get more wind and solar than expected, so energy storage is a natural solution to the problem
[18:06:24] <dminuoso> You use excess energy in times when your production cant match demand (becuse again, you cant control when the sun shines or the wind blows)
[18:07:06] <dminuoso> With the current energy uses, there's simply not enough areas in most countries to build sufficient PHES to survive completely on solar and wind
[18:21:13] <__monty__> Hmm, are water-supply level PHES a thing?
[18:21:46] <__monty__> Like, could the local water tower be used for energy storage?
[18:22:00] <dminuoso> Sure, its just probably not big enough to make a dent
[18:22:14] <dminuoso> Or rather, if we talk about micro grids again, this could be a thing.

[18:25:12] <kritzefitz> How would pumping between them release energy?
[18:25:34] <dminuoso> You have one tower located higher than the other?
[18:25:50] <dminuoso> Or rather, you could have one tower with two tanks above each other.
[18:26:12] <dminuoso> One intriguing current concept is using rotating concrete cylinders
[18:26:25] <dminuoso> Has much better energy density than water
[18:26:46] <dminuoso> You can scale this almost arbitrarily (say you can make the cyliner as heavy as several dozen tons)
[18:27:25] <dminuoso> PHES has, comparatively, lower losses
[18:27:46] <kritzefitz> Using two separate tanks implies that the higher cylinder would be higher than is required for the water system. At that point I'm not sure why you should bother doing this with a water supply tower instead of a completely separate tank with non-drinkable water.

[18:50:53] <__monty__> I was just thinking of water stored in relatively high places. The idea would be to make them bigger than required for drinking water. And then the water can be used for either energy production or simply as water supply. Putting new water towers everywhere would probably run into NIMBY.
[18:52:04] <geekosaur> problem there is drinking water is a scarce resource compared to non-potable water, and also needed for other things (e.g. farming)

[19:14:02] <kuribas> geekosaur: it could be made interesting, for example financially.
[19:14:12] <dminuoso> But Im realistic that we will not have a fully renewable energy grid 30 years from now.

[19:14:55] <kuribas> dminuoso: you're underestimating the ability for people to come up with solutions.
[19:15:26] <geekosaur> you're underestimating the unwillingness of people to change what they're doing that "works now"
[19:15:51] <dminuoso> Perhaps, but when the current state of research is that there's no scalable energy storage solution for adequate power storage for the current power uses of the national grid in Germany...
[19:16:01] <dminuoso> Then the mere theoretic research says "we dont even know how to build it"

[19:19:45] <dminuoso> It absolutely is
[19:19:58] <dminuoso> And that's why the EU commission just 3 weeks ago labeled nuclear power as a renewable energy
[19:20:01] <geekosaur> because nobody wants a nuclear power plant in their backyard
[19:20:04] <dminuoso> So it can funding and benefits as a transition method
[19:20:18] <kuribas> dminuoso: nuclear is not renewable by definition.
[19:20:24] <dminuoso> kuribas: It absolutely is

[19:20:44] <dminuoso> let me check
[19:20:51] <kuribas> dminuoso: how are they going to "renew" nuclear fuel?
[19:20:52] <dminuoso> Yeah, it's officially "green energy" now.
[19:20:57] <janus> neither phrasing is used on https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Nuclear-and-gas-criteria-set-for-inclusion-in-EU-t
[19:20:57] <dminuoso> kuribas: Sorry, the term was "green"
[19:21:01] <janus> where do you see 'green'?
[19:21:24] <dminuoso> kuribas: Also mind you, it has absolutely nothing to do with the meaning of the word, it's just a regulatory action so nuclear energy can get additional funds and grants.
[19:21:34] <dminuoso> janus: It's a misphrasing.
[19:22:48] <polyphem> green === CO2 neutral
[19:22:50] <dminuoso> janus: Anyway. My point is the EU comission is intentinoally changing taxonomy to allow nuclear and particular gas power plants to be considered similar to renewable sources for the purpose of receiving similar funding and grants
[19:23:12] <dminuoso> The rationale is: it's absolutely necessary as a transitionary technology since we cant get sun and wind done by 2050
[19:23:39] <dminuoso> Simply because there's too many unsolved challenges
[19:25:58] <janus> Yeah, it's great that it was added to the taxonomy. And Poland wants nuclear too. It's gonna be great.
[19:26:34] <dminuoso> It's certainly living on burrowed time. :)
[19:27:23] <dminuoso> I wonder, is CHP feasible with nuclear power plants_
[19:27:29] <dminuoso> With all the radiation I mean... :)
[19:28:35] <geekosaur> seems like it should be
[19:28:59] <geekosaur> I mean you have alll that excess heat going into the steam towers
[19:29:00] <Logio_> yeah, but it's been ruined by radiation scares (and partially logistics)

[19:29:14] <dminuoso> Logio_: I suppose logistics is definitely a primary problem.
[19:29:31] <dminuoso> Most nuclear power plants are built quite distanced from cities, presumably by regulation
[19:29:49] <dminuoso> geekosaur: Mmm thats a fair point
[19:30:16] <Logio> here in FI the reactors are just warming up the seawater, though at least the heat is used for some aquaculture farming IIRC
[19:31:00] <Logio> there's been talk about minireactors (container-sized or so) that could be setup near cities to provide heat as well
[19:32:04] <Logio> I'm just waiting for Olkiluoto 3 to come fully online and get a chance for cheaper electric bills
[19:32:39] <dminuoso> Perhaps that might explain why Bill Gates vision resides on minireactors
[19:33:38] <dminuoso> Local small power grids, to make small local power storage feasible and create independent grids (reducing cascading blackouts in an inherently less stable network), easier CHG for heating, reducing the need to burn additional fossils..
[19:33:59] <dminuoso> If only we had unlimited uranium and some way to dispose of the waste..
[19:34:16] <dminuoso> It seems like fusion power plants, if ever feasible at scale, will come 50-100 years too late. :(

[20:58:38] <geekosaur> in any case, the "true renewables" etc. comes from the EU directive, not from my thinking. they explicitly label nuclear a stopgap

[20:59:38] <monochrom> Although, you can point to human nature that if it buys 50-100 years of time, people will be complacent and do nothing.

[21:14:47] <dminuoso> A big problem about uranium is that the vast majorities of it is limited to a handful of countries. If Uranium is to become the primary source as a bridge-fuel until we are running on mostly renewables, that can setup for geopolitical tensions.

[21:18:29] <dminuoso> According to cen.acs.org we have a quarter million tons of nuclear waste.
[21:19:35] <dminuoso> Nuclear waste has this annoying property of irrepably damaging soil to the point that you cant reasonably inhabit it in the span of our civiliation depending on lifetimes and the ecosystem interactions

[21:21:10] <janus> ok, i guess we must just assume it could kill more than the 4.2 million that die from outdoor air pollution per year.

[21:23:04] <dminuoso> A fuel rod of U235 typically weighs what, nearly 200kg?
[21:23:14] <dminuoso> And large scale reactors have some 200+ of them?

[21:25:01] <dminuoso> Chernobyl was, despite so many poor decisions, extremely lucky. Imagine you have an explosion that ejects half that uranium into the air, or perhaps some intermediate fission products after a core meltdown.
[21:25:41] <dminuoso> You now have 40 metric tons of nuclear waste that could make an regions exceeding that of a country completely uninhabitable, not to mention global ecosystem damage

[21:31:09] <dminuoso> The Germany association BEE produced calculations, that a full liability insurance policy would have to cost a nuclear power operator 72 billion EUR a year on average.
[21:31:33] <dminuoso> That quantifies the kind of risk and damages a nuclear power plant operates at.
[21:33:35] <dminuoso> Assuming that, the power price would have to rise by a factor of 20 to financially cover the potential damages
[21:33:40] <dminuoso> For residential consumers
[21:34:40] <dminuoso> Sorry, that was incorrect
[21:34:46] <dminuoso> It was not BEE but Versicherungsforen Leipzig that did this calculation.
[21:36:43] <janus> if the german public wanted to buy an insurance that pays them if they do not have cheaper power than the average french person, 99.9999% of the time, how much would that cost?
[21:37:06] <dminuoso> I dont understand the question
[21:38:29] <janus> my point is that there is also an economic cost to unreliable or expensive power production. but insurance for that is not mandatory, so maybe there is no figure for it
[21:39:21] <dminuoso> Well the economic cost of unreliable of expensive power production is handed to the consumer directly.
[21:40:05] <dminuoso> But the risk of potential damages is not handed off if you arent even liable for damages.
[21:40:24] <dminuoso> What the above study gives us, is an indication of what kind of massive damages a nuclear power plant could cause.
[21:40:55] <dminuoso> Mind you, if the insurance policy costs 72 billion annually, that does not mean this is the upper threshold of a singular event.
[21:40:57] <__monty__> IIRC there have been designs for low-output reactor types that would harness highly-radioactive waste, turning it into low-radioactive waste in the process?
[21:41:25] <janus> why have these damages even been estimated, while the damaged i talk about have not been estimated? i wouldn't be surprised if germans have made the insurance for the nuclear power operators mandatory
[21:41:31] <dminuoso> It means, if we have infinite nuclear power plants with some failure rates and a damage distribution, on average, how much would each operator have to pay for the insurance to be able to cover liability
[21:41:48] <janus> and what if they were state-run and uninsured? :)
[21:42:01] <dminuoso> janus: the risk to society is all the same.
[21:42:12] <dminuoso> Whether its state run or not does not change the damage it can cause.
[21:42:39] <janus> but it changes whether it must be insured or not
[21:42:42] <dminuoso> janus: And the damages you talked about have been estimated as well, by the way
[21:43:06] <dminuoso> janus: No, the risk of a nuclear power plant is, unless for gross negligence, independent of whether its insured or not.
[21:43:15] <dminuoso> Compare that with your health insurance
[21:43:34] <dminuoso> You might pay say 10,000EUR a year such that your health insurance will cover unlimited liability
[21:43:49] <dminuoso> We do this because at worst, we might spend some millions in a hospital for prolonged procedures.
[21:44:13] <dminuoso> Whether or not you have health insurance does not change the risk of you getting sick enough to warrant that treatment.
[21:44:31] <janus> i just mention state-run because state-run entities often do not have to get insurance
[21:44:31] <dminuoso> Similarly, the risk of a power plant causing national wide damage does not depend on whether its insured or not.
[21:44:41] <dminuoso> Sure, but lack of insurance is not the point.
[21:44:45] <janus> it is only insured because somebody wrote a law making it mandatory, probably
[21:44:56] <janus> who wrote the law? wouldn't be surprised if they were anti-nuclear
[21:45:12] <dminuoso> janus: Again, my point is not that they should be insured with full liability
[21:45:22] <dminuoso> It's merely that the above study gives a quantifiable risk of damages,
[21:45:29] <dminuoso> Besides you asked:
[21:45:34] <monochrom> Oooohhhhh wouldn't it be nice if I could avoid sickness just by paying money :)
[21:45:35] <dminuoso> 19:11:25      janus | why have these damages even been estimated, while the damaged i talk about have not been estimated? i wouldn't be surprised if germans have made the insurance for the nuclear power operators mandatory

[21:47:55] <monochrom> Scammer!
[21:48:04] <carbolymer> I swear!
[21:48:05] <dminuoso> A better number however is not the current deaths, but long term economic and ecosphere damages if the climate is rampaged enough
[21:48:13] <dminuoso> And that one is really hard to predict I guess
[21:48:39] <geekosaur> there have been studies about that, I can't point to them off the top of my head but they are done and regularly ignored by the powers that be
[21:48:54] <janus> well let's hope germans get super unreliable power production before they get too hooked on russian gas
[21:49:36] <dminuoso> geekosaur: I think its more difficult than "they are being ignored". Political reality is that no singular person has control, so if you want laws to pass, you need a hundred elected officials to nod on it, all of whom want to elected and serve wide masses and rich companies.
