[04:08:03] <TML> anyway, the real point is "If you need to know the difference between 'file does not exist' and 'could not determine whether file exists'", you want to use posix_access(), where you can check posix_get_last_error() - because EACCES and ENOENT are _decidedly_ different error responses.

[06:26:16] <NakedKing> it worked differently on me. I lost and stucked on core php, then tried laravel first started to understand framework tools, than started to make small things. this gave me enthusiasm. then i started to delve core php.
[06:30:06] <jaguardown> Well, I guess I'm weird. I like the nitty gritty of building things. I'm just cobbling together a proof of concept prototype for a website with like, 3 main features.

[06:36:18] <__adrian> read about a bunnch, try the one that makes the most sense to you.
[06:36:45] <__adrian> if you're making a small project, you might look at the "micro" frameworks, like slim4, lumen, etc..
[06:37:07] <__adrian> they're basically just routers and a middleware stack. very straightforward.
[06:38:03] <NakedKing> Yes a micro frameworks may be cool for modal-view-controller structure
[06:38:45] <__adrian> "MVC" makes no sense in most php code
[06:38:48] <jaguardown> In reference to your code comments, that was a snippet from a larger file so maybe some context was missing?
[06:38:54] <__adrian> the web is request→response.
[06:38:57] <jaguardown> But yeah it was a tutorial, I didn't write that code
[06:39:18] <__adrian> you seemed interested in learning from it, though.
[06:41:03] <jaguardown> yeah, seemed past tense, not anymore lol
[06:41:04] <__adrian> MVC makes sense in UI, e.g., the desktop or in a web browser. it is not at all practical for most php code - just a buzzword. php code that advertises "MVC" is either doing something heavily modified, or they don't know what it means in the first place.
[06:41:14] <__adrian> you can still learn from it
[06:41:21] <__adrian> it's a fantastic pile of common mistakes
[06:42:18] <__adrian> most "MVC" code you see in php is just the RoR directory structure with an  /a/b/c -→ A::b($c)  routing system.
[06:42:28] <NakedKing> but something is neater on mvc
[06:42:47] <__adrian> how do you mean
[06:43:01] <jaguardown> haha, well it's annoying that someone writes a tutorial for something but it doesn't even work. I had to comment out their so called empty form validation to make it submit
[06:43:26] <__adrian> did you var_dump($_POST) ?
[06:43:46] <jaguardown> not yet, just telling the reason I came to ask for help
[06:44:31] <NakedKing> I mean, MVC seems tidy for who checks the codes. This means more understandable code structure by another developer.
[06:44:42] <__adrian> that would be the way to figure it out. i don't see anything in particular that would make it fail (in _that_ way), so some context missing
[06:45:48] <__adrian> NakedKing: the RoR structure forces you to put related pieces of code in different folders. it's actively _more difficult_ to read and understand.

[06:50:04] <NakedKing> Didnt u mean everybody has different ideas on MVC. I understand everybody using it differently
[06:51:34] <__adrian> i was talking more about the _reason_ everybody does it differently in php - it's not a standardaztion problem. it's the fact that MVC _doesn't work_ for most things you use php for. it doesn't work for request→response.
[06:51:57] <__adrian> everyone has to do something different in roder to solve that problem and try to stuff it into the web.

[11:43:58] <joo-_> need to see if any files has changed to update some cache
[11:44:18] <joo-_> just scan dir for any filemtime changes, then update the cache for the ones with changed mtime

[11:45:38] <TinoDidriksen> If you need that frequent updates, it's probably better to store the mtime in a database so you can sort by it. There's also the option of executing "find"
[11:46:23] <AllenJB> You may also want to look at inotify
[11:46:53] <joo-_> this is a pretty good channel ! :-)
[11:48:07] <joo-_> inotify would probably be a pretty good solution to set up a watch and continously read from that file what changes there are and act on that, but again it could just be a daemon running and updating a database...
[11:48:36] <TinoDidriksen> Polling is much slower than inotify.

[15:54:55] <Numline1> (I've tried [$a, $b, $c => null] ... but that didn't work)
[15:55:42] <Blondie101010> if your data is really that bad, the very first step you must do is to fix it
[15:56:00] <TinoDidriksen> Why do you want them into separate variables? Just keep it as an array.

[15:56:23] <TinoDidriksen> explode() into array, fixup array if it's lacking, use array.
[15:56:39] <Numline1> TinoDidriksen it doesn't really matter, that's true, I just wanted a way to reference them in a more "clean" way, but I can easily map that array to have keys if needed
[15:56:47] <Numline1> I was just hoping it could be done as a one liner
[15:57:07] <Blondie101010> "one liner" is not good...  often is really is bad
[15:58:20] <Blondie101010> but if your delimited input is missing a field with its delimiter, the data you extract from it will NOT be reliable
[15:58:41] <TinoDidriksen> You can make an explode_n() function that pads the returned array if it's short.
[16:02:03] <Numline1> Fortunately, I have the power of Laravel Collections at my disposal, meaning I can just explode it into an array and then run a map() on it to check which keys exist and key them
[16:02:13] <Numline1> and/or there might be some more optimal helper for that as well
[16:02:20] <Numline1> either way, thanks, I'll see what can be done

[17:34:30] <last1> anyone that was able to post to django via curl ? I keep on getting csrf errors. I'm using the same cookies via the cookiejar and am parsing the initial page for their middlewaretoken
[17:34:45] <last1> this is my code so far: https://pastebin.com/UK05Ve1N  , not very elegant but I'm trying all sorts of things
[17:35:16] <last1> as far as I can tell I am sending the same cookie that I am getting from the page, and the proper middlewaretoken
[17:35:48] <PHPNoob> I'm training SQL Injection and i'm looking this code:
[17:35:49] <PHPNoob> $user_id = explode(' ', $_POST['user_id'])[0];
[17:35:49] <PHPNoob> $query = 'SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = CAST('.$user_id.' AS INT)';
[17:35:50] <PHPNoob> Someone see a way to bypass this?
[17:36:30] <PHPNoob> i tried with user_id=1'%20or%201=1 but no luck
[17:36:58] <Naktibalda> PHPNoob: I think that it would be better to simply cast user input to INT in PHP code
[17:37:00] <AllenJB> The correct solution to SQL injection is to use prepared queries. Then you don't have to worry about anything else.
[17:37:09] <Naktibalda> $userId = (int)$_POST['user_id']
[17:37:24] <jargon> user.id===1'+||+1=>1
[17:37:26] <jargon> :P
[17:37:45] <PHPNoob> I'm not the developer.. its just a challenge to bypass it
[17:38:45] <last1> sounds pretty silly
[17:38:47] <Naktibalda> yes, you have to avoid using spaces in your injection
[17:39:41] <PHPNoob> and use what?
[17:39:49] <PHPNoob> that explode is killing me
[17:40:26] <PHPNoob> i've tried with sqlmap and thousand of payloads

[17:42:48] <PHPNoob> what?

[22:18:39] <sharpertool> is it 100%.. if not, I'm probably gonna have a hafrd time
[22:18:53] <hans> sharpertool: less backwards compatible than 7.4; you should probably go 7.2->7.4

[22:19:34] <sharpertool> literally
[22:20:04] <da_wunder> yes, first you should upgrade to 7.4 and after that to 8.x, and for that upgrade just look - https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.php
[22:20:33] <hans> sharpertool: the easy answer that i want to give you is "can you upgrade to 7.4 and see if it still happens?"
[22:21:41] <sharpertool> @hans -- I already resolved it. I had to add the redis extension in /etc/php.d/21-redis.ini -- that forced it to load *after* the json.. it's all good now
[22:21:48] <da_wunder> sharpertool: also see - https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php - so 7.4 support will end in this year
[22:22:05] <sharpertool> I'd like to upgrade to php7.4 also.. but, can't afford a migration issue
[22:22:24] <da_wunder> what migration issue?
[22:22:36] <sharpertool> anything that might not work the same..
[22:22:49] <sharpertool> if 7.4 is really backward compatible.. then, yeah, it makes sense
[22:23:18] <da_wunder> there should not be BC between minor versions
[22:23:27] <__adrian> from 7.2?
[22:23:49] <sharpertool> From 7.2 -> 7.4

[22:30:40] <hans> da_wunder: fwiw php is far older than semver, seems semver was created in 2013, php was created in... 199x-something?

[22:33:07] <da_wunder> hans: I know
[22:33:39] <da_wunder> it's just sad that they haven't started to do versions according to semver
[22:34:37] <hans> hmm, well that would mess up their currently release schedule, php7.3 would be called 8.0, php7.4 would be called 9.0 etc
[22:35:28] <da_wunder> if they start to use that, it won't change anything in the past - just the future releases
[22:35:52] <hans> true
[22:37:08] <Albright> They should take the Firefox/Chrome approach and increase the major version number for every release. We'll be up to PHP 67 in no time, thus rendering version numbers entirely meaningless
[22:38:02] <hans> wonder how much code would break in PHP40 because code thinks its running in PHP4
[22:39:54] <__adrian> hint: php4 doesn't exactly care/know what version it is

[22:41:01] <hans> fwiw here is how JRE checks if its running windows 9x  (Windows 95, Windows 98, etc): https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/739769c8fc4b496f08a92225a12d07414537b6c0/test/jdk/java/io/File/WinDeviceName.java#L54
[22:41:11] <hans> so guess why Microsoft didn't make a Windows 9....
[22:41:43] <Albright> Ah, so there's one of the culprits.

[22:44:07] <Albright> It took Apple a while to be able to count to 11 too to be fair

[22:48:35] <hans> Albright: so in the distant future, microsoft will jump straight from Windows 899 to Windows 1000.. because nobody bothered updating JRE

[22:49:21] <Albright> No, they can't use 899 or 1000 because it will confuse software checking for Windows 8 or 10.

[22:50:49] <hans> not sure who checks if they're on win8 tho.. win8 was a very boring release
[22:51:01] <hans> the last interesting release was Vista

[22:55:49] <da_wunder> JRE is making that check and I would bet that multiple other applications do those too
[22:57:59] <hans> i bet some early dev version of windows 10 was named 9, and everything (everything written in Java, and then some) kept breaking,
