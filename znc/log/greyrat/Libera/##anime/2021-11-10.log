[00:49:47] <Jigsy> My Dad once hit someone with a motorcycle and had to pay for the ambulance ride.
[00:49:53] <Jigsy> Even though the old guy was clearly at fault.
[00:49:56] <KatrinValerie> Jigsy: If you are uninsured, it is covered by public insurance which is mandatory unless you can afford private insurance or freelance
[00:50:01] <Jigsy> This was back in the 70s, though.
[00:50:29] * MootPoot puts glasses on Jigsy 
[00:50:31] <KatrinValerie> and with private insurance you usually get the hospital bill yourself and pay it and then your insurance pays it back to you
[00:50:53] <TsundereNoises> what if you don't have enough money to pay the bill in the first place?
[00:50:55] <Jigsy> People say you should exercise to avoid heart attacks.
[00:51:05] <Jigsy> But it's funny, because people have heart attacks whilst doing exercise.
[00:51:12] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: then you just hand the bill to the insurance and tell the hospital to please wait
[00:51:43] <TsundereNoises> that's just how insurance works by default here

[00:51:55] <MootPoot> 360
[00:52:03] <TsundereNoises> they bill the insurance company for the part they cover and you have to pay the rest, but you don't have to pay it all at first

[01:11:04] <NekomimiNoises> obviously, you're a rational person
[01:11:19] <Urchin[emacs]> I have to admit Hordak and Entrapta are well suited to each other

[01:36:00] <NekomimiNoises> if we could just get more people to watch movies that don't get billion dollar ad budgets
[01:36:02] <KatrinValerie> should look into all the new gojira content
[01:36:23] <NekomimiNoises> shin godzilla was good
[01:36:25] <KatrinValerie> NekomimiNoises: yep there is good indie stuff
[01:36:38] <KatrinValerie> but it's rare
[01:36:46] <NekomimiNoises> a lot of the rest of it was mediocre to bad, of what I've seen which is admittedly not including that shitty looking anime one
[01:37:11] <NekomimiNoises> KatrinValerie: I used to (and am finally on track again for) watch 100 movies a year, of those there are a lot of great ones
[01:37:16] <KatrinValerie> often times artsy movies get too artsy really and you are not going to get it without an insight into the art
[01:37:35] <KatrinValerie> and when I need someone to explain a film to me so I can appreciate it, it does not resonate as well
[01:37:38] <NekomimiNoises> and the funny thing is, sometimes I'd see 100 movies and not see ANY of the ones someone who watched 5 movies and then decides they hate movies watched
[01:38:47] <KatrinValerie> I rarely am in the mood to watch something these days though
[01:38:53] <NekomimiNoises> KatrinValerie: well I was going to suggest Portrait of a Lady on Fire (french) to you, but maybe it'd be too artsy?
[01:39:13] <KatrinValerie> Most of the time I really like artsy stuff
[01:39:18] <KatrinValerie> just when things get too meta
[01:39:34] <NekomimiNoises> it's maybe the best cinematography in recent memory for me
[01:39:39] <NekomimiNoises> and otherwise also a good movie

Tell the otaku that you are in love with him and ask if you can be one of his completely subservient girlfriends. Step 3. He will panic and turn you down. That's okay. Step 4. Tell him that you're into cosplay and would like his opinion on your various outfits. Pressure him into letting you. Step 5. Model for him, giving as much fanservice as possible, while 
[03:45:40] <Nanobot> keeping it, you know, classy. Step 6. Don't actually cosplay in public where others can see you. Instead, only be in cosplay while silently watching him play video games. Step 7. You're basically his girlfriend now. Congratulations!

[08:25:18] <tcsilver> I have a girlfriend named gwen :D
[08:25:42] <tcsilver> who is an internet girlfriend and an in real life friend named nicole :D
[08:26:19] <tcsilver> nicole wants to be my gf but she has different interests
[08:26:35] <tcsilver> but she is such a good mom to her kids
[08:26:38] <tcsilver> that I like her
[08:26:47] <tcsilver> so we hang out often most years
[08:27:02] <tcsilver> my family took her in when she was a kid... she is 10 years older than me
[08:27:12] <tcsilver> her mom died when she was 17 and i was 7
[08:27:23] <tcsilver> and so my grandmom and uncle took her in
[08:27:36] <tcsilver> I knew her since I was born
[08:28:28] <tcsilver> read everything :D I'm upset about my martial arts skill being very poor now... BUT I'm upbeat and have a good outlook.... I can maybe practice kata more now
[08:28:53] <tcsilver> my wrestling is mostly gone too
[08:29:40] <tcsilver> I used to be able to do even 40,000-to-100,000 burpies and roman chairs
[08:30:11] <tcsilver> I'm not sure how my swimming is.. swimming is the only real reason i was good at other sports
[08:30:40] <tcsilver> I was the first to name the areas most winning swim team ;---D ... and I was one of it's first members.
[08:31:16] <tcsilver> also:i started training in weights and calesthenics to emulate swimming long distances at an early age

[08:38:21] <tcsilver> in naruto the kicks don't look like they have real power but i love naruto

[08:47:54] <amigojapan> I am at the bank now, reissuing a card I thought I had lost
[08:47:56] <MootPoot> probably wont matter for my use case- but either way I'm not swapping out of am4 until like 2025

[08:48:27] <amigojapan> Let's see if trash taste is so accurate, they say Japanese banks are a pain
[08:50:08] <tcsilver> due to my lack of martial arts skills since being medicated... I joined coast guard auxiliary :---D .... I was super excited for various reasons....
[08:50:54] <tcsilver> anyways now that there is covid... I get to participate when I want :D
[08:50:58] <amigojapan> So far so good at the bank. Except there are many people
[08:50:59] <tcsilver> so..... I get to watch mroe anime
[08:51:01] <tcsilver> more*
[08:51:12] <tcsilver> but we shouldn't say it's a good thing
[08:51:34] <tcsilver> my mma gym called and said it opened back up.. but I don't trust it due to covid.

[09:02:14] <tcsilver> I didn't

[09:52:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> CPython has GIL so it has to fake threading.

[09:55:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MicroPython != CPython
[09:55:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a distinct implementation.

[09:56:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *de-facto standard
[09:58:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The GIL, in CPython, makes it fundamentally single-threaded.

[10:08:53] <MootPoot> I heard vscode can do it, and vscode does have a M1 build 
[10:09:04] <MootPoot> But it has its own issues 
[10:09:12] <MootPoot> Haven't tried either personally yet
[10:15:06] <theholyduck> vscode does it via platfromio 
[10:15:30] <theholyduck> no idea if that runs on the new macs
[10:15:46] <theholyduck> but its definitly miles better than arduino IDE
[10:17:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The default IDE is kinda meant for newbies.

[10:21:21] <ButterNoodle> u know.. euphoria isnt so bad..
[10:21:59] <ButterNoodle> man today anyone can use a cnc mill or lathe.. its all software
[10:22:19] * ButterNoodle searches for tool crash videos on youtube
[10:22:49] * ButterNoodle just runs full rate into tailstock
[10:22:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah. I did mean one of the things where most of the work is in the CAD software and the physical work is mostly waiting for things to be done, moving them once in a while and waiting more.
[10:23:24] <ButterNoodle> as a machinist in a former life that shit is great for production machining
[10:23:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Manual machining requires different and, in my opinion, harder to obtain skills.
[10:23:45] <ButterNoodle> but for a single run prototype its a little unnerving
[10:24:02] <ButterNoodle> one fuckup and ur done
[10:24:37] <ButterNoodle> I've spent weeks working on fixtures and tooling.. and then fuck up a cut and have to "improvise"
[10:25:08] <ButterNoodle> my dad was the big machinist.. he worked on large scale stuff and setup production
[10:25:23] <ButterNoodle> I inherited the knack from him
[10:26:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Where did you get metal for it? Did you melt it down at home?
[10:26:21] <ButterNoodle> I did it for a living
[10:26:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> None at home?
[10:26:32] <ButterNoodle> so I just had someone order the stock :|
[10:26:37] <ButterNoodle> I wish
[10:26:44] <ButterNoodle> I'd love a lathe and mill
[10:26:48] <ButterNoodle> non cnc is fine
[10:27:02] <ButterNoodle> most of the good stuff is 3 phase
[10:27:18] <ButterNoodle> either a lot of work converting it over, or get a inverter
[10:27:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, that means getting custom wiring work done.
[10:27:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or setting up a generator/inverter yourself, yeh.
[10:27:54] <ButterNoodle> I was an electrician briefly.. can doit myself.. but lots of work
[10:28:04] <ButterNoodle> and again mistakes are painful
[10:28:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Legally where you're at?
[10:28:53] <ButterNoodle> not a licensed electrician, more like the guy that knew enough to fix things on the production line

The only delays were that I had to wait a while cause I did not have an appointment, but that was not bad... And that they take 10 days to 2 weeks to actually mail me my new card... But I think that is normal for brick and mortar banks

[10:39:36] <MootPoot> There plenty of issues right there 
[10:39:41] <MootPoot> Waiting for an appointment
[10:39:48] <MootPoot> Having to even GET an appointment
[10:39:58] <MootPoot> Upto 2 weeks to mail a card
[10:40:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but you get more security
[10:40:24] <MootPoot> If you lost your bank card and had no way to pay for things for 3 weeks 
[10:40:35] <MootPoot> 1 for getting an appointment 2 for mail
[10:40:39] <MootPoot> That's garbage 
[10:40:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you can pay without the bank card in Japan
[10:41:10] <MootPoot> Yeah, with real money 
[10:41:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Huh. Here there's no appointment. I can even just signal it as lost online or over the phone.
[10:41:27] <MootPoot> Japan is a bit weird that they still use money 
[10:41:32] <MootPoot> Paper money 
[10:41:33] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah and also I have the bank book
[10:41:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Russia still does a lot.
[10:41:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Lots of other places too.
[10:41:56] <MootPoot> amigojapan: but also a physical bank having more security is a illusion
[10:42:12] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I did that over the phone. This was reissuing it
[10:42:14] <MootPoot> Identity theft is common
[10:42:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Identity theft is possible because of a bunch of assbackwards choices to facilitate economy over common sense.
[10:42:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh and conservatism.
[10:42:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the card was broken. Maybe from going in the ocean with it
[10:43:04] <MootPoot> MootPoot: but compare that to here 
[10:43:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> SIN numbers or whatever as an indicator of identity are absolutely retarded.
[10:43:20] <MootPoot> You spent 3 weeks or so overall 
[10:43:31] <MootPoot> 2 for mail and 1 for appointment
[10:43:49] <MootPoot> I can get a new card with a phone call, an auxiliary passcode and 3 days 
[10:43:59] <MootPoot> For mail
[10:44:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But for some reason, governments are stupidly slow to change them.
[10:44:11] <MootPoot> Even less if I go into the branch and pick up the card 
[10:44:25] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: SIN was never designed to be a identifier like that 
[10:44:52] <MootPoot> The only reason why it happened is because Americans got a cock up their ass about a universal national ID system 
[10:45:11] <MootPoot> "big govvment" and all that 
[10:45:16] <amigojapan> Don't be a SINner

[10:46:32] <MootPoot> Just because you don't value your time as much dosent mean other people don't 
[10:47:25] <MootPoot> If my bank told me 3 weeks to get a new card I'd just go online and change banks 
[10:48:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Our local government has something similarly stupid.
[10:48:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that is the maximum time, things always take less than the maximum time in Japan. Usually close to the minimum time
[10:48:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's slightly less stupid, but still astoundingly so.

[10:50:32] <amigojapan> Ok

[10:50:41] <MootPoot> That's fine
[10:50:43] <amigojapan> Yes
[10:50:56] <MootPoot> Did they have any option to just request a new card over the phone 
[10:51:06] <amigojapan> No
[10:51:24] <amigojapan> It's better this way, more secure
[10:51:38] <MootPoot> Proof? 
[10:51:59] <amigojapan> Otherwise someone may request a card falsely

[10:52:22] <MootPoot> Only you know

[12:26:22] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: my flourecent light blew out last night, and it seems they are moving from flourecent to LEDs at the shop. The replacement wold cost 50usd but I only bought one ring for 25usd  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/EZWIvS1G/irccloudcapture5934230119298703358.jpg

[12:44:56] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: That sounds way too pricey for a led light unless it is really really bright
[12:46:38] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Did you safely dispose of the shards and air out the room? That's pretty important with Flourecent lights that break during use
[12:47:15] *** Joins: Emmanuel_Chanel (~emmanuel@ZN024008.ppp.dion.ne.jp)
[12:48:02] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: the bulbs are about 1.7 times the price of the flourecent, but are better in many ways. The fluorescent had a lifetime of 14000 hours but the led has 40000 hours
[12:48:12] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: it did not brake
[12:48:59] <amigojapan> Break*
[12:49:00] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: you said it blew out and thought that meant it burst
[12:49:19] <KatrinValerie> But I guess the idiom is ambiguous
[12:49:28] <amigojapan> No I meant it just stopped working
[12:51:45] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: it is an LED bulb designed to fit in my flourecent light fixture
[12:52:26] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: these are a lot cheaper here, but they usually have a poor colour bandwidth
[12:52:56] <KatrinValerie> Maybe the prices went up since I last bought one
[12:53:18] <amigojapan> This one is designed to be just like flourecent which is not a good thing
[12:54:17] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: let me check Amazon. Maybe the shop was over charging
[12:54:36] <KatrinValerie> Regular E27 LED bulbs are starting at less than 3 euro here
[12:55:59] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: $50 for a single light sounds overpriced, unless it's for a special fixture that somehow makes it more expensive
[12:57:41] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I can't even find any bulbs that are that expensive when I look around in German webshops ._.
[12:58:04] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: it's for a special fixture, it is a ring shape  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/EZWIvS1G/irccloudcapture5934230119298703358.jpg

[12:59:17] <KatrinValerie> Yeah if that is not some standardized bulb size and socket, you are out of luck

[13:03:02] <KatrinValerie> They still do it, but it is not legally binding
[13:03:18] <KatrinValerie> You just have to restore the original state when you move out

[13:03:54] <KatrinValerie> I mean, if there wouldn't be any spare parts for this it would have to be replaced anyways.
[13:04:14] <KatrinValerie> And reducing costs of future repairs is probably in the interest of your landlord too
[13:04:52] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: or do you think they will absolutely not allow anything in the flat you're renting to change?
[13:05:00] <KatrinValerie> That just sounds so odd from a european POV

[17:52:20] <Cryowolf> To make a love potion you need a young girl with innocence and purity, she'd be drained of blood to the border of death and then a spell would draw her innocence from her soul. Afterwards they can be saved and brought back to life, if the maker of the potion cares. The love potion must be stored inside a living being and is thus made into the heart of a homonculus. Which becomes a very small girl (the size of Happy in Fairy Tale), 
[17:52:20] <Cryowolf> whose heart must be consumed by those who shall be in love.

[21:12:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Youtube is a shitty platform, that's nothing new. They've also been getting worse in general.
[21:13:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Adpocalypse is now a constant event.
[21:15:28] <Roey> hmm
[21:16:47] <Jigsy> Yeah.
[21:20:00] <S_T_A_N> Roey, in terms of how youtube's algorithm weights stuff, dislikes are equal to likes. 
[21:20:20] <S_T_A_N> No engagement is a better protest. 
[21:34:19] <Roey> ahhhh

[21:36:12] <sscout> Buried in the 9th paragraph of this article, Netflix spent a grand total of $6,305 on translation for SQUID GAME, most of which didn't go to the translator. On a show that reportedly made them almost a billion dollars. Pay translators what they're worth.

[21:44:44] <Jigsy> 3>No, I get the feeling this is all about the various big entities like e.g. EA or Ubisoft or similar ones wanting to hide the dislikes from the public so as not to temper down any hype they're attempting to drive up -- if all the gamers etc.
[21:44:47] <Jigsy> I can believe this.
[21:45:32] <Cryowolf> I mean I want to be able to see the dislikes cause then I can see if a tutorial is gonna be good or not, if a review is good or not, if a troubleshoot or a video of tips and tricks etc is good
[21:46:30] <Cryowolf> there's "dislike bombing" and "review bombing" but they could just weight review bombing to make them valued less at the dislike
[21:46:32] <Roey> Jigsy: ahhhhhh
[21:46:36] <Roey> yes, I thought that too
[21:46:58] <Roey> that they might see it as a way to quell the backlash they've been getting from users, and now Congress
[21:47:01] <Roey> so I totally see that.
[21:47:36] <Jigsy> Apparently not liking something is "review bombing" thrse days.
[21:47:38] <Roey> Cryowolf: totally agree with what you say as well regarding the utility of likes/dislikes as a measure of whether or not a video is worth watching

[23:09:06] <MootPoot> somebody explain to me what the point is of the 8gb raspi 4 if the current stable OS is only 32bit
[23:09:08] <MootPoot> I dont get it
[23:09:17] <Bco1981> no one does
[23:09:36] <MootPoot> are there other non-raspbian/raspiOS builds that are stable release and 64bit?
[23:09:50] <Bco1981> i think arch is
[23:10:05] <MootPoot> *arches his back like a cute girl*
[23:10:16] <MootPoot> does it have some kind of workaround  to access the leftover 4g
[23:10:34] <MootPoot> I've heard some 32bit systems /programs can do that
[23:10:59] <Bco1981> yeah, i tested the desktop raspbian os, that is 32bit too. but it saw the 8gb i had in a core2quad pc
[23:11:14] <Bco1981> it changes the kernel to x86-64
[23:11:31] <Bco1981> but, i couldn't install nvidia drivers
[23:12:10] <Bco1981> it was probably because most of the apps and libs were 32bit, but only the kernel was x86-64
[23:12:22] * MootPoot is visibly confused
[23:12:48] <MootPoot> what's the difference between x86 , x86-64 , 64bit and AMD64 again
[23:12:59] <MootPoot> are they all the same thing
[23:13:23] <Bco1981> i think the x86-64 is just a addon kinda thing, that it makes it able to access more ram.

[23:17:15] <MootPoot> so a fully loaded Visual Studio 2022 install is about 50 gigs
[23:17:19] <MootPoot> pretty typical
[23:18:11] * MootPoot clicks install
[23:18:30] <MootPoot> Bco1981: it took then a fucking decade to actually have a legit 64bit visual studio
[23:18:52] <MootPoot> thankfully they ported .NET to all platforms with .NET core
[23:19:02] <MootPoot> on .NET6
[23:19:39] <Bco1981> only a decade? i have been using MS office since 97... i finally paid for one a few months ago.
[23:19:53] <MootPoot> well
[23:20:00] <MootPoot> people have been asking for it since about 2008
[23:20:05] <MootPoot> they've been draggin their heels
[23:20:18] <Bco1981> oh, legit 64bit... i thought you ment in like one you paid for
[23:20:48] <MootPoot> So far it's been pseudo using more then 64

[23:23:32] <Sapphirus> There are tons of IDEs out there other than Visual Studio.
[23:23:34] <MootPoot> what do people on linux  use to code anywya
[23:23:45] <MootPoot> aside from VS code
[23:23:52] <Sapphirus> IntelliJ is one.
[23:24:00] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: true, but most have some sort of catch
[23:24:29] <MootPoot> VS is the only do-almost-everything-and-be-upto-date-and-free one
[23:24:44] <MootPoot> although I am a fan on IntelliJ stuff - I used PHP storm for a while
[23:25:23] <Sapphirus> Some people even just open vim or emacs and use those.
[23:25:26] <MootPoot> I guess the only other ones I know which can approach the tier VS is on is eclipse and netbeans
[23:25:42] <Sapphirus> I did a bit of python with vim.

[23:27:31] <Sapphirus> :q
[23:27:40] <MootPoot> you must be a god to be able to exit vim
[23:29:09] <Sapphirus> Using it is not that difficult.
[23:29:26] <Sapphirus> It's faster than using a gui editor once you nail down the basics.
[23:30:18] <Sapphirus> Terminal multiplexer and you don't even have to quit vim to test your code.
