[04:22:42] <Fangs> weibel's story is more about how you have two exact functors or something and when you compose them you can form a spectral sequences
[04:22:55] <Fangs> there's also a story about triangles, but I don't know if he covers that
[04:23:32] <Fangs> there's also a story about filtered complex and double complex story too, but idk if he covers those three
[04:24:22] <Fangs> I'm only aware of the first notion but never proved equivalencies between the others
[04:24:23] <loopspace> Overall I don't like Rotman's book that much, but it is useful. I like using Mac Lane, and when I want more details I go to Rotman. His Spectral Sequence chapter isn't bad, though. Kinda funny, too. Rotman starts with exact couples, and it's pretty readable, IMO. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/EXAdXO54/image.png

[07:00:43] <Fangs> for Q3, take n red boxes and n blue boxes, there are (n+n choose n) ways to distribute n-balls into the blue and red boxes (so each box have at most 1).
[07:01:14] <Fangs>  take (n-1) red boxes and n-1 blue boxes and a black box, there are ((n-1)+(n-1) + 1) choose n) ways to distribute n balls into the blue and red boxes. there are two ways to colour the back box, red or blue
[07:01:27] <Fangs> here's how you convert the first set of object into the second
[07:01:39] <Fangs> choose the "last" box from the red boxes and the blue boxes.
[07:01:39] <Fangs> if both are filled, then fill the black box and paint blue
[07:01:39] <Fangs> if red is filled and blue is empty then fill back box and paint the box blue
[07:01:39] <Fangs> if red is empty and red is filled, then fill back box and paint the box red
[07:01:39] <Fangs> if neither is filled, then black box is empty and paint red
[07:02:37] <Fangs> cherim: I kinda hate this solution, this feels a bit like those parity check you do for data or w/e. but this lets you encode 2-bits of information using choice of paint on the black box and choice of to put a ball there or not

[07:36:28] <slycelote> Fangs: given 2n balls, how many ways to choose n red balls and 1 blue ball? On the one hand, (2n choose n) ways to choose n red balls followed by n ways to choose a blue ball. On the other hand, 2n ways to choose a blue ball followed by (2n-1 choose n) ways to choose red balls. So (2n choose n) * n = 2n * (2n-1 choose n)

[07:43:53] <Fangs> cherim: is this from his enumerative combinatorics book?
[07:44:22] <cherim> Yes, it's Stanley vol.1
[07:44:45] <Fangs> which page? do you happen to know?
[07:44:54] <slycelote> cherim: I like your proof more because it avoids the extra n multiplier :)
[07:45:22] <cherim> Yes, the usual rule is that you have to count LHS/RHS directly, not prove an equivalent identity
[07:45:45] <Fangs> I was going to break down the cases into when n is odd/even
[07:45:47] <cherim> You can try with others from that picture
[07:46:00] <Fangs> and use parity check to determine the rule for the colouring the empty black box red or white

[08:06:17] <Fangs> ok what about this? sum{0 <= k <= n} k (n choose k) = n2^{n-1}
[08:06:58] <Fangs> suppose you have n labelled balls, and you are painting all of them either black or white, but you're destroyiing one of them at the end
[08:07:27] <Fangs> then there are (n choose 1) ways to choose which balls to get destroyed, and 2^{n-1} ways to paint the rest.

[08:09:13] <cherim> And LHS?
[08:09:21] <Fangs> on the LHS, there are (n choose k) ways to paint k balls white, and (k choose 1) way to destroy one of them
[08:09:23] <int-e> Fangs: C(n,k) = n/k C(n-1,k-1)
[08:10:12] <cherim> So you have to destroy a white ball?
[08:10:35] <int-e> (that identity has a neat combinatorial proof too: k C(n,k) can be interpreted as marking one out of k selected balls; n C(n-1,k-1) can be interpreted as selecting the marked ball first, and then the remaining k-1 balls)
[08:11:46] <int-e> Fangs: Which is similar to what you proposed, except less destructive ;)
[08:12:00] <Fangs> cherim: thats the only way I can make sense of the k choose 1, and I had to prescribe a way of which ball gets destroyed
[08:12:26] <Fangs> int-e: we're kinda idly working on problems here https://i.imgur.com/FsZWYge.png
[08:12:38] <cherim> Another way is "total number of elements in all subsets of {1,2...n} may be counted by subsets (LHS) or by elements (RHS)"

[14:39:52] <Inline>  In the case of the real numbers R viewed as a vector space over the field Q of rational numbers, Hamel bases are uncountable, and have specifically the cardinality of the continuum, which is the cardinal number 2 ℵ 0 {\displaystyle 2^{\aleph _{0}}} 2^{\aleph _{0}}, where ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}} \aleph _{0} is the smallest infinite cardinal, the cardinal of the integers.
[14:40:33] <Inline> The preference of other types of bases for infinite-dimensional spaces is justified by the fact that the Hamel basis becomes "too big" in Banach spaces: If X is an infinite-dimensional normed vector space which is complete (i.e. X is a Banach space), then any Hamel basis of X is necessarily uncountable. This is a consequence of the Baire category theorem. The completeness as well as infinite dimension are crucial assumptions in the
[14:40:33] <Inline> previous claim. Indeed, finite-dimensional spaces have by definition finite bases and there are infinite-dimensional (non-complete) normed spaces which have countable Hamel bases.

[17:10:20] <riv> so im kinda struggling to get my heard around this concept of communication over a noisy channel
[17:10:49] <riv> a noise level of 0.5 means that the output is completely random, and half the bits are correct by chance
[17:11:26] <riv> but noise level = 0.5 means you flip half the bits

[17:11:52] <riv> actually that does make sense now
[17:12:26] <X-Scale> the interesting result is that no matter how noisy the channel is, you can always have reliable communication over that channel

[19:23:10] <[-_-]> with my limited knowledge this seems impossible
[19:23:45] <Z-module> If you only want f to be continuous, it's not that hard to construct. Getting f differentiable is a mess.
[19:25:38] <Z-module> so with A = {all proper local maxes of f}, B = {all proper local mins of f}, each of A, B dense in R, and f differentiable, this means f' is 0 at all points of the dense set A cup B   but f' is not 0 on any interval.
[19:25:41] <Z-module> very strange
[19:25:58] <Z-module> sorry, I mean, for every interval (a,b), f' is nonzero at points of (a,b)

If DEC1 rejects <M> then M1 rejects <M,w>.  (3) If M accepts w then M1 accepts <M,w>. Now it

[21:32:09] <int-e> Because then the tape can never change unless you write a 1. You can just simulate the TM until a state repeats.

[23:19:04] <lakitu> if it's already a whole number I don't need to scale it
[23:19:05] <int-e> I don't know what you expect to happen for an infinite product
[23:19:09] <lakitu> so you can exclude those
[23:19:28] <lakitu> they will get the proper scaling (multiple) & stay whole numbers
[23:19:37] <lakitu> so you could exclude whole numbers from n_k/d_k
[23:19:42] <int-e> lakitu: the point is that the factor depends on all the n_i and all the d_i and probably doesn't exist if the product is infinite.
[23:19:44] <lakitu> thanks for the help
[23:20:03] <lakitu> so far I am working with finite-term products
[23:20:10] <lakitu> products with a finite number of terms
[23:20:18] <int-e> lakitu: its' not about integral factors either. 2/15 * 3/10 = 1/25
[23:21:47] <int-e> (but gcd(5,10) = 2, lcm(15,10) = 30 and 15*10 = 150, and none of those is 25. 150 is the only one that's at least divisible by 25.)
[23:23:08] <lakitu> the * is misleading enough, I agree. I could just atlked about the set of all n_k/d_k, scaling those numbers
[23:23:22] <lakitu> it's an arithmetic... \ number theory problem.
[23:23:41] <int-e> The actual factor is the product of the n_i, divided by the gcd of the product of the d_i, and the product of the n_i. n_1*...*n_k / gcd(n_1*...*n_k, d_1*...*d_k). It really doesn't simplify much, though you can fruitfully split the product and reduce the partial products before combining them.
[23:24:12] <int-e> If you want to scale the numbers individually, then riv's answer was correct.
[23:24:17] <lakitu> ok

[23:24:55] <lakitu> I think that's what I needed
[23:27:22] <lakitu> what I was looking at was e.g. 1/2 * 2/3, scale by 2*3=6 & get 3 * 4 - great; but then 1/2 * 2/3 * 3/4 gives 24(=2*3*4), where as you don't need to multiply by 2*3*4, just 3*4: 12 .* {1/2, 2/3, 3/4} gives {6, 8, 9} (so 12 was less than 24). the algorithm is, cast out lower multiples of higher denominators - I just wanted the easiest way to figure that - (I think this is right anyway)
