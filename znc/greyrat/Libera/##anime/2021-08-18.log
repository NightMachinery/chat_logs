[00:54:05] <Berlin36> i like that it doesn't require too much resources
[00:54:07] <Berlin36> the server
[00:54:25] <Berlin36> i launch it on my phone and it's okay, working in background
[00:54:34] <Berlin36> not 24/7 tho
[00:54:40] <Bco1981> what is the view disctance on that phone server ? 2 ?
[00:54:51] <Bco1981> distance*
[00:54:53] <Berlin36> and 1.16.5 is a bit heavier than 1.8.8 of course
[00:55:01] <Berlin36> what is view distance
[00:55:23] <Bco1981> how many chunks you can see, distance
[00:55:53] <Berlin36> ohh does it depend on the server?
[00:55:57] <Bco1981> my overclocked rpi4 was... almost working okay with 2
[00:56:10] <Bco1981> Berlin36: the server has that setting
[00:56:14] <Berlin36> oh
[00:56:20] <Berlin36> how can i look it up
[00:56:35] <Bco1981> server.properties file
[00:56:39] <Berlin36> sec
[00:57:12] <Berlin36> 10
[00:57:21] <Berlin36> it's set to 10
[00:57:36] <Bco1981> some how i can't belive that, that can run fine... on a phone.

[01:00:42] <Berlin36> how is Raspberry Pi4?
[01:00:47] <Berlin36> is it worth buying?
[01:00:57] <Bco1981> depends on what you want to use it for
[01:01:10] <Bco1981> desktop... i would not recommend it
[01:01:15] <Berlin36> well i want first of all to setup something of a cloud storage
[01:01:28] <Bco1981> Emulation station perfect, even runs Playstation 2 games
[01:01:45] <Berlin36> not bad
[01:01:46] <MootPoot> does anybody know why they used that trash af broadcom cpu
[01:02:08] <MootPoot> and just not a bone stock ARM cortex with no mods
[01:02:15] <Bco1981> kodi Player runs 1080p movies fine, but the 4K is lagging still even if it is supposed to have hardware decoding for it,
[01:02:36] <MootPoot> Bco1981: are you sure its using the decoder for it?
[01:02:45] <MootPoot> or what if its the SD card that can't keep up
[01:02:51] <Bco1981> it's not from what i read
[01:03:48] <MootPoot> I've had troubles with something like that
[01:03:49] <Bco1981> back when i last read/tested it it was only librec or something like that, that could do 4K on the rpi4
[01:03:59] <MootPoot> on my orange pi
[01:04:00] <Bco1981> raspbian os couldn't
[01:04:04] <MootPoot> turns out slow ass SD card
[01:04:25] <Bco1981> i tried from NAS too
[01:04:35] <Bco1981> to rule out the SD card
[01:04:42] <MootPoot> is the Rp4 ethernet 1gbit or 100meg?
[01:04:47] <Bco1981> 1gig
[01:05:00] <Bco1981> and iperf says almost 900mbit
[01:05:01] * MootPoot shrugs
[01:05:18] <MootPoot> idk maybe it can decode it but its maxing out the cpu at the same time resulting in the UI lagging
[01:05:28] <MootPoot> or maybe ur out of ram idk
[01:05:30] <Bco1981> i overclocked... still can't
[01:05:36] <Bco1981> nope
[01:05:43] <MootPoot> I mean a Rp4 overclock is kinda
[01:05:46] <MootPoot> pointless
[01:05:56] <Bco1981> yeah does not give much performance
[01:06:12] <Berlin36> is overclocking safe?

[02:07:08] <Bco1981> once the map was generated, and started the server 2nd time... took 10 seconds to load.

[07:06:12] <Jigsy> btw, I use arch.
[07:06:30] <MootPoot> you arched over your keyboard to tell us that you use arch
[07:06:31] <isekaijin> Just counting *work* tabs I have 20 of them.
[07:06:34] <Jigsy> I have ten tabs open.
[07:06:43] <Jigsy> It's usually seven.
[07:06:50] <MootPoot> emmeka:  my point exactly made by isekaijin 
[07:07:02] <emmeka> you can absolutely abuse tabs and not fill up 16gb
[07:07:11] <Jigsy> ^
[07:07:13] <MootPoot> ^
[07:07:15] <emmeka> source: I am a serial abuser of tabs
[07:07:17] <Jigsy> You can abuse tabs and not even fill up 8GB.
[07:07:44] <MootPoot> running windows 10 and just chrome, it takes like 40-60 tabs to fill up 16g assuming you're doing other shit at the same time
[07:08:03] <emmeka> you would have to be doing some hefty shit at the same time
[07:08:07] <MootPoot> for me personally my PC at idle uses like 32gb
[07:08:24] <ButterNoodle> running a few vm's and mining monero
[07:08:26] <MootPoot> but anyway, 16 is nuff
[07:08:30] <MootPoot> 16 makes u nut
[07:08:35] <emmeka> ButterNoodle that would do it.
[07:08:50] <MootPoot> I usually have like 200 tabs open across multiple browsers
[07:08:58] <MootPoot> with my devtools and other stuff well
[07:09:04] <MootPoot> and running a game in the background
[07:09:30] <MootPoot> plus a bunch of other apps that are also browsers
[07:09:55] <MootPoot> and Windows subsystem for linux
[07:10:07] <MootPoot> but for normals 16 is plenty
[07:10:29] <MootPoot> I would wager emmeka  would be ok running 8 with linux or 12 with windows as well
[07:10:38] <MootPoot> same with most peeps
[07:10:45] <MootPoot> although that leaves no wiggle room
[07:11:01] <mathu> my desktop has more than 2k tabs
[07:11:07] <mathu> oh
[07:11:15] <mathu> you're talkign about 16gb ram not 16 tabs
[07:11:20] <emmeka> 8 was a bit too little for me, I bought another 8gb last year to get to 16gb
[07:11:29] <MootPoot> emmeka:  I'm in the process of reviving a old laptop with 8g of ram
[07:11:44] <MootPoot> scored a freebie 500g ssd, ordered replacement keyboard and battery
[07:11:52] <emmeka> like 8 is useable but you can't do much of anything simultaneously
[07:11:59] <MootPoot> its a old dual core i5 but with hyperthreading
[07:12:07] <MootPoot> probably going to just run manjaro on it
[07:12:20] <mathu> i think unless you're doing really specialized stuff 16gb should be fine for several years
[07:12:52] <mathu> and if you're someone who could do everything they need to on a chromebook you're fine with 8 or less
[07:12:54] <MootPoot> I'm robocopying its old 500g hdd to the 500g ssd I scored
[07:12:58] <emmeka> RAM is trivial to upgrade too so don't think too hard about it, go as low as seems reasonable and add more later if you need
[07:13:35] <mathu> i think my chromebook has 16gb ram lol
[07:13:48] <emmeka> what's it even using it for :P
[07:14:18] <MootPoot> Running more instances of chromeOS
[07:14:26] <mathu> i use the linux VM constantly
[07:14:33] <emmeka> fair enough
[07:14:53] <mathu> i've done a little android development on it, some c++ development, and even a little node.js development
[07:16:16] <mathu> i'm a huge chromebook advocate if you are specifically me or the archetypal normie non-power-user who just streams movies, checks email, and doomscrolls on social media
[07:19:04] <emmeka> I am still salty about chromebooks because in like 2012 my roommate bought a first gen chromebook, and wanted me to switch it to another distro for them to get "real linux", and I tried only to find the bios like totally locked out and inaccessible and it was an absolutely pain in the ass to do
[07:19:18] <emmeka> this is apparently not the case anymore, but I will never forget how much it annoyed me
[07:20:06] <MootPoot> if he's smart enough to know about linux and to get a first gen chromebook as well why'd he ask you to do it
[07:20:54] <emmeka> she, and she really didn't know much about linux, she just liked my OS better than chromeOS and wanted it instead and I was like, yeah sure, easy peasy
[07:21:13] <MootPoot> what did you have at the time
[07:21:47] <emmeka> linux mint, I think

[09:32:30] <DunceCotus> pteague: not a huge fan of Marvel
[09:32:31] <sentionics> I'm sure there's some interesting background for the term "trash panda". I just assume it's because raccoons are always digging around in dumpsters, and well, panda is another animal to relate them to due to fur color patterns, hence "trash panda"

[09:34:01] <DunceCotus> However, later genetic research placed red pandas in their own family: Ailuridae. Studies of their evolutionary history show that red pandas are an ancient carnivore species and are probably most closely related to skunks, raccoons and weasels. "

[10:34:18] <mathu> "Another stated intention of the series is for it to be more accessible to non-fans than the original TV series and films were" ehhh, hm. i'll agree for 1 and 2 bc they're shorter than 26 eps but 3 is positively wild
[10:34:19] <DunceCotus> well they do some new stuff with the series in rebuilds
[10:34:22] <amigojapan> mathu: obviously to squeeze as much money out of the fans as possible
[10:35:14] <DunceCotus> I know someone who has not seen the original series who connected with Eva through rebuilds alone
[10:35:20] <DunceCotus> so it seems to have worked

[10:35:39] <mathu> amigojapan: a little less cynically, i think it started around 10y after End of Evangelion? and anno etc may have been feeling nostalgic or like they wanted another pass

[15:28:50] <loveorcognac> I don't understand why that is still popular
[15:29:31] <Bco1981> it's not popular, it is good for remote control of a computer hosted somewhere else on the internet.

[19:00:33] <amigojapan> Nice nekobit 
[19:00:58] <nekobit> i need to improve the collection and create a downloadable zip someday
[19:01:06] <nekobit> but i have shite bandwidth so i couldn't upload all my kots
[19:01:37] <amigojapan> nekobit: people can right click to download the image
[19:02:18] <nekobit> yes, but it gives random image on refresh... so you can't be sure you've seen all the kots
[19:02:34] <amigojapan> Ok
[19:03:10] <nekobit> Sadale: what does your server (or multiple) run?
[19:03:41] <Sadale> nekobit, I've got a home server that's only accessible inside my local network. And I've rented a couple of VPS's. One of them's hosting sadale.net
[19:03:42] <amigojapan> Nginx
[19:04:06] <Sadale> nekobit, and yes my servers are running nginx for web stuffs.
[19:04:19] <nekobit> i only have one vps, and a friend lets me borrow another. I also use nginx for everything because apache syntax is no
[19:05:11] <ButterNoodle> tf is that web page
[19:05:27] <Sadale> The home server has all kind of services. It has a printer server, XMPP server, paste service, file sharing server, etc. :3

[19:07:17] <ButterNoodle> is ok.. I cum to u from canadaland
[19:07:29] <Sadale> I mean if there're enough users visiting the site nekobit wouldn't be able to tell which one's which
[19:07:43] <amigojapan> nekobit: a cloak won't protect our ups on your web page
[19:07:48] <ButterNoodle> how many cat pics?
[19:07:55] <nekobit> ^ i get plenty of bot requests, i'm considering actually just disabling port 80 and switching to something else
[19:07:58] <Sadale> Keep refreshing :P
[19:08:26] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, maybe we could make a script so that we could download all of the cat pics there :p
[19:08:37] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, oh. even better. Put the site on waybackmachine.
[19:08:44] <nekobit> or i could just... release a zip soon :3
[19:08:50] <Sadale> nekobit, :D
[19:08:51] <ButterNoodle> just a loop.. let it run for 10 hrs and filter out the dups
[19:08:58] <Sadale> yep.
[19:09:09] <Sadale> That shouldn't be difficult
[19:09:11] <ButterNoodle> rip ur bandwidths
[19:09:15] <Sadale> but I'm too lazy to do that :P
[19:09:26] <nekobit> fuck you guys :'3
[19:09:42] <nekobit> actually its fine my server should be able to handle this
[19:10:04] <ButterNoodle> oh wow
[19:10:07] <ButterNoodle> ur close
[19:10:13] <Sadale> Let's DOS the server! :P 
[19:10:23] <ButterNoodle> naa.. I dont joke about that
[19:10:28] <Sadale> Apparently it's hosted on Digital Ocean. There's a bandwidth limit of 1TB for the cheapest box.
[19:10:41] <Sadale> After that 1TB nekobit would have to pay extra
[19:10:47] <Sadale> :D :D :D
[19:10:49] <nekobit> im not doing cheapest atm
[19:10:53] <nekobit> so don't bother

[21:52:52] <MootPoot> I need to get a red dot, then find a mounting plate that matches the style of the mounting plate for that red dot but also matches the mounting place on my slide for a red dot
[21:52:53] <ButterNoodle> I love them
[21:52:56] <MootPoot> is that right
[21:53:07] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: for what piece?
[21:53:17] <MootPoot> my hipster 
[21:53:21] <ButterNoodle> generally, yes
[21:53:23] <MootPoot> sp01 shadow
[21:53:30] <ButterNoodle> is ur slide milled already?
[21:53:59] <MootPoot> uh, no...from what I can figure out, I gotta remove the rear sight and it goes in the slot for that
[21:54:07] <ButterNoodle> yuck no
[21:54:13] <ButterNoodle> u want a mos slide
[21:54:53] <MootPoot> what's wrong with the rear sight mount
[21:55:07] <MootPoot> I know its not perfectly in line and is a little raised
[21:55:30] <ButterNoodle> as an engineer... that small dovetail does not give enough support.. I feel it would never stay zeroed
[21:55:58] <Berlin36> who's name100
[21:56:08] <ButterNoodle> tbh I dont like the mos
[21:56:13] <ButterNoodle> since u have to get a plate
[21:56:15] <Nanobot> Why does the California DMV keep spamming me about RealID every few days?
[21:56:20] <ButterNoodle> that is between the optic and the slide
[21:56:30] <Nanobot> I'm not going to the fucking DMV during a pandemic if I don't have to.
[21:56:34] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: because ur gonna be a terrorist if u dont get one
[21:57:17] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: my opinion is to get a slide that allows for direct mount of the optic.. no plate
[21:57:22] <Nanobot> "Your license is due to be renewed soon, take advantage of the opportunity to upgrade to a REAL ID now to save yourself the extra hassle later!" Soon = 2025?
[21:57:31] <MootPoot> rip
[21:57:43] <ButterNoodle> thats the only reason I bought the p320 with the romeo.. its direct mount
[21:58:27] <MootPoot> thats like 600 bucks
[21:58:31] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: the scare tactic in my state was that you needed a real id before XXXX year or you wont be able to get on an airplane and they made it sound like you wouldn't be able to travel from state to state
[21:58:36] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: for the slide?
[21:59:54] <MootPoot> for only milling
[21:59:57] <ButterNoodle> jfc I paid less than $800 for the p320 with the romeo nib.. and I felt like my local gun monger didnt grease my ass before that one
[21:59:58] <MootPoot> new slide is 800
[22:00:07] <ButterNoodle> fuck that
[22:00:14] <ButterNoodle> not worth it

[22:00:55] <ButterNoodle> tbh tho.. I wouldnt ruin that cz with an optic
[22:01:05] <ButterNoodle> maybe add some good adjustable sights
[22:01:50] <ButterNoodle> I'd put an optic on a piece of tupperware... not on a classic

[23:29:58] <snake> is a social construct another term for a concept?
[23:30:33] <KatrinValerie> Kind of but not exactly
[23:30:35] <emmeka> basically a way of saying it exists as a part of the structure of society and not some innate material truth
[23:30:47] <KatrinValerie> A concept is more broad

[23:33:38] <snake> ideas do not "exist" the same way matter and energy does

[23:34:56] <emmeka> snake the marx-ish take here would be that the ideal is derivative of the material, that only matter "really exists" and ideas/thoughts/social constructs/whatever are just reflections of actual material conditions (from the arrangement of atoms in your brain, to the classes of society)

[23:38:51] <emmeka> isekaijin well, we were bored and talking philosophical crap, feel free to shift the conversation elsewhere. also feel free to answer my question from earlier about who you are :P
[23:39:15] <snake> yeah this is super obscure metaphysical shit now, welcome aboard :D
[23:39:36] <isekaijin> Socialism is the poison that destroys the cohesion of a nation.
[23:40:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: The same could be said of capitalism.
[23:40:12] <snake> emmeka, im trying to remember the purpose of my ontological position
[23:40:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It encourages a free-for-all winner-takes-all view.
[23:40:28] <Berlin36> sailormoon is overrated, change my mind
[23:40:29] <KatrinValerie> Why would the universe be deterministic
[23:40:31] <Berlin36> *runs*
[23:40:39] <mathu> emmeka: isekaijin knows about ##yandere yet doesn't expect a topic like this to come up in this channel? sounds like a GRU op to me
[23:40:40] <KatrinValerie> when quantum states aren't really
[23:40:48] <isekaijin> GRU?
[23:40:52] <KatrinValerie> or am I misunderstanding something?
[23:40:53] <emmeka> Berlin36 can't be, it contains Uranus/Neptune
[23:40:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KatrinValerie: Prior to quantum physics, it was more likely so than probabilistic.
[23:41:10] <Berlin36> im still laughing at uranus
[23:41:16] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: you need to watch the original series up to sailor star
[23:41:20] <mathu> isekaijin: russian intelligence agency
[23:41:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> On a meta-universal view, it's deterministic, just not within a single universe.
[23:41:29] <mathu> isekaijin: (a joke)
[23:41:32] <Berlin36> here we go, i fixed the chat
[23:41:34] <KatrinValerie> I have not watched Crystal yet, but all who loved the old show called it bad
[23:41:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If multiverse is a thing.
[23:41:41] <emmeka> Berlin36 you did good.
[23:41:45] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, sounds like something you pulled right out of your armpit sir
[23:41:46] <emmeka> much better segue than isekaijin
[23:41:48] <Berlin36> yep ;)
[23:42:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: The paraphrasing, yes. The generally idea? Hell no.
[23:42:13] <emmeka> Sailor Uranus confused the hell out of young emmeka sexually
[23:42:18] <emmeka> I regret nothing
[23:42:45] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, someone on youtube told me that the universe is still deterministic even though the quantum level is probabbilitysitic
[23:42:45] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin not saying anything anymore implies they really were a GRU
[23:42:50] <isekaijin> If I were Russian, I would probably a monarchist. The last real legitimate government they ever had, even if the last monarch was an incompetent fuck.
[23:43:02] <emmeka> lol
[23:43:02] <isekaijin> probably be*
[23:43:10] <KatrinValerie> How is that a legitimate government
[23:43:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: It isn't. The total state cannot be determined from a prior state even with complete knowledge of all variables.
[23:43:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is what strict determinism means.

[23:45:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: What you're refering to is macro-scale determinism.
[23:45:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is a subset of the original idea.
[23:45:28] <snake> ok well im not that smart to know the difference
[23:45:31] <emmeka> isekaijin wait wait wait wait. wait.

[23:46:07] <emmeka> hmmmm...
[23:46:21] <snake> idk spoonm was never this serious about it. like he was serious but like in a goofy teasing way
[23:46:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: It's mostly computationally impossible to apply on a general scale from within the universe. 
[23:46:28] <emmeka> true
[23:46:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Only so much compute can fit within a given area of space.
[23:46:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And it's not enough to fully represent all the states of the self-same computee.
[23:46:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *compute
[23:47:11] <snake> well im not saying the universe can be simulated with a computer in our universe, but our fates are decided ;-;
[23:47:31] <emmeka> isekaijin I'm just confused why you clearly are one of us, but won't identify yourself. if you're worried about getting caught for ban evading, don't worry about it, there's a clean slate with the channel switch.
[23:47:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: I'm saying it effectively doesn't matter because you cannot reasonably determine fate.
[23:47:53] <snake> fortunately i have this illusion of free will where i can use what i know and what i want to make a calculation to make the best "decision" possible
[23:48:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And multiverse theory kind of... fucks a bit with fate.
[23:48:32] <KatrinValerie> y'all too paranoid about unkown nicks
[23:48:32] <snake> i dont believe in any multiverse
[23:48:35] <snake> that isnt science
[23:48:40] <snake> it's a religion

[23:49:33] <snake> yeah some people think that way about god, doesnt make it true
[23:49:42] <KatrinValerie> But it only really becomes interesting if someone can propose an actual experiment to check if it's true
[23:50:11] <KatrinValerie> otherwise it remains on the same level as the existence of god
[23:50:30] <KatrinValerie> Of *a god
[23:50:49] <snake> the scientific answer is "we don't know yet"
[23:51:02] <KatrinValerie> Let's be clear here, if there actually is one, all religions are still man made and we have no idea what a god might think of them
[23:51:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: More like "we have ideas, we need to figure out how to test them"
[23:51:03] <emmeka> KatrinValerie well, not paranoid, I was just curious. they knew about yandere so they're someone from the old channel. but now I've asked them point blank several times who they were, and they just won't answer, and now I'm curious as to why
[23:51:20] <KatrinValerie> But I just see no reason for the existence of a god
