[01:05:44] <peteyboy1> so i have typescript installed for my nextjs project. with the default settings as they are, should i only define types of things in the cases where i get errors if i don't define them? for instance, i don't get any if i don't define what a function returns (or if it returns something), should i still do it or not?
[01:06:48] <stenno> if you are using typescript, you should always be as explicit as possible
[01:07:19] <stenno> why would you install it if you are not going to use it
[01:07:30] <peteyboy1> that's kind of what i thought, that that is the point of typescript. but i also expected it to warn me about defining the type where it should be defined
[01:07:45] <stenno> your linter can also do that
[01:08:34] <Alexendoo> peteyboy1: I don't what next chooses, but assuming it's got noImplicitAny then yeah using type inference is fine
[01:08:42] <Alexendoo> If it doesn't, then turn strict on

[01:09:44] <peteyboy1> i guess i'm fine
[01:10:43] <peteyboy1> something else i'm supposed to check?
[01:11:02] <Alexendoo> Then yeah that's fine
[01:11:52] <peteyboy1> Alexendoo, in that case, is there something else it doesn't warn about that i should be defining, apart from functions?

[01:17:14] <peteyboy1> it is initially undefined, but i specified that it can be in the state
[01:17:56] <Alexendoo> TS prevents implicit conversions, as in it's an error to do undefined < number

[01:18:14] <Alexendoo> You can explicitly convert it if you want, or in this case I'd say give it an initial value so it's not |undefined

[03:49:32] <stenno> might be a better tool if you really want to overenigneer
[03:49:48] <stenno> OhTheCode: but that string is passed to new RegExp

[03:52:18] <stenno> and RegExp constructor knows that | means OR so it will use it to construct the regular expression instance
[03:52:20] <OhTheCode> but it returns true if i do this - var regex2 = new RegExp( arr.join( "|" ), "i"); instead of "\\|"

[09:45:57] <theskillwithin> sounds like something id rather defer

[09:47:18] <teut> no , what you told is helpful still

[10:04:08] <teut> but I m using CRA
[10:04:17] <theskillwithin> its called code splitting because it splits it into different js files

[14:40:55] <patchie> greasemonkey code: https://pastebin.com/cd8sSANV
[14:41:14] <patchie> When i hover over the pdf link first time, it previews the pdf file, but not the second time, why is that? what is wrong in my greasemonkey code?
[14:41:23] <fweht> sillyslux__: ah, i just wondered because i found that fragment in a code, so it seems using `document.body` is superior in any case, thanks a lot!

[16:53:20] <lmat> In node.js, I'm doing import os from 'os'; const var = os.process.env.VAR;  The error is "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'env')" suggesting that os.process is undefined.
[16:53:45] <lmat> I ran `node` to get an interactive environment and os is defined, but os.process is not. In that REPL, I did os = require('os'); and that didn't change anything.
[16:53:52] <lmat> How do I read environment variables inside nodejs?
[16:54:31] <stenno> process is a global object in node
[16:54:48] <stenno> you should be able to do just `process.env`

[20:06:06] <FlorianBad> (I was thinking of using a dataset on something to refer to the style and sheet, but I don't think that's possible because these can only be strings, right?)

[20:20:26] <austincheney> FlorianBad, you can get the style content by walking the DOM and the get its innerHTML as string and then store that in any variable
[20:20:43] <austincheney> if the style content is in a style tag
[20:21:09] <austincheney> if its an external file using a link tag then you will do to do something else

[23:19:47] <teut> from the docs
[23:20:00] <teut> https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#cloneelement
[23:20:18] <systemfault> I don't know if that changed.. but components starting with a lowercase are builtins... and treated by React as such
[23:20:24] <teut> now how will you add   key={index} on it
[23:20:55] <teut> systemfault , maybe the dot here   ".type"  makes the difference
[23:21:11] <systemfault> What's .type?
[23:21:20] <teut> see the docs
[23:21:41] <teut> a react component is a big js object
[23:21:47] <systemfault> I don't think they really mean .type
[23:22:08] <teut> idk , I saw a reactconf few days ago, there I saw it
[23:22:11] <ljharb> teut: yes, i know it works, but it still looks bad

[23:22:51] <teut> this thing fails
[23:23:02] <teut> the key prop will now be discarded
[23:23:26] <teut> thats what I m asking, a solution to this
[23:23:48] <teut> looks good to me atleast
[23:24:34] <ljharb> fails how

[23:25:20] <teut> isnt discarded same as rejected?

[23:25:24] <ljharb> and no, they are not
[23:25:33] <ljharb> discarded is silently erasing it, rejected is loudly failing because it's there
[23:25:45] <ljharb> but `key` is a special prop, you can't have a component receive a "key" prop
[23:25:51] <ljharb> it's something only react can see
[23:26:08] <teut> I even tried passing md={6}  of MUI
[23:26:14] <teut> that also got rejected

[23:49:42] <theseb> how simulate visiting a URL with JS? I tried window.location.href = url; but it doesn't work
[23:50:09] <matsaman> theseb: you want to change the address without reloading?

[23:51:09] <theseb> matsaman: i only want to hit the URL because it will activate some service side tasks
[23:51:26] <theseb> matsaman: I can visit the URL in a browser...just want to do same with JS
[23:51:27] <matsaman> you want to xhr it maybe
[23:51:41] <matsaman> or 'fetch'
[23:51:48] <theseb> matsaman: wow...so my little window.location.href = ".." really isn't good enough
[23:51:53] <theseb> matsaman: thanks
