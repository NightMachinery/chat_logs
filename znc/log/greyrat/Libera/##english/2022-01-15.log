[01:09:42] <juliaEnv> doctors of medicine have poisons (toxic poisonous concoctions) and they need to sell them in as many doses as possible, to as many people as possible, for the biggest possible cash flow (and longest possible cash flow, ideally each person should have it dictated until death)
[01:11:07] <juliaEnv> like with the covid poison. It's not a vaccine. It's a drug. It has to be taken every few months (the months are getting shorter the more you take it) and it's eventually needed until death
[01:14:36] <juliaEnv> a teacher makes you smarter. A manipulator makes you more stupid. So, they are not teachers. They are manipulators. A doctor means a teacher, from latin docera. They are the exact opposite, they are manipulators, but they fraudulently call themselves teachers. To me, they are manipulators and at the same time technicians. So, the technical part is either science-based (invented by a scientist, not by doctors, so you can 
[01:14:36] <juliaEnv> scientifically measure something in your body) or it is a manipulation (you cannot measure it and it is opinion-based, meaning constructed by manipulators with a god complex and they pretend it is science and truth when it is manipulation and lies)

[01:39:46] <bin> For example, I have to take Vitamin D and my doctor offered to write me a prescription or she said I can get it OTC (Over The Counter), and she recommended a specific brand to me. She doesn't get any kickbacks, it's just one of the more reputable brands.

[05:25:06] <FishBone000> Guys, I found that it seems schools taught us how to be nice, but have never taught us how to fight against evil. And they didn’t taught us how to struggle when situation gets worse.
[05:25:54] <FishBone000> They only taught us to tell the teachers, while it’s possible that they just sit and do nothing.

[05:35:17] <FishBone000> Gee, IRCing on iOS is surely painful
[05:41:14] <FishBone000> Well, I mean, yeah you might say “Life will teach you these.” But I have seem people failed to survive hard times, affecting how they see the world permanently. Won’t it be better if they are taught how to look forward, how to remain hope when they are still young?
[05:42:11] <FishBone000> Of course schools can’t teach everything, but I think some basic principles are enough. These can at least point out the way when people are in down time.
