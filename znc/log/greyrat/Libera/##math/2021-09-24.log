[00:53:32] <vckt> well i showed the first part of what Z-module said but im not completely sure on how to proceed
[00:53:49] <vckt> (i just assumed that it wasn't true, then showed by contradiction that it must be true)
[00:53:51] <riv> so that set has a unique smallest element
[00:54:07] <vckt> yeah
[00:54:38] <riv> we have x <= n,  if n >= x + 1 then n-1 would be in the set
[00:54:56] <riv> so you can conclude that n < x + 1
[00:55:38] <vckt> oh
[00:55:50] <vckt> hmm yeah that makes sense
[00:55:53] <vckt> got it, thanks a lot
[00:56:55] <riv> so for an alternative proof, if we know R = Disjoint-Union[n=-inf,inf] [n,n+1), then when x is in R, x is in one of those intervals [n,n+1) and n <= x < n+1
[00:57:26] <riv> but proving that original thing is probably a hassle

[02:22:28] <somiaj> In general what you do is some sort of hypothesis question, where you ask what is the probability that the measurements I am getting is due to some outside cause (like smoking) vs just natural randomness in blood preasure
[02:23:21] <qergle> if smoker bp reacts post cigarette like a blip then returns to some trend line type thing you might have enough with 2
[02:23:44] <somiaj> and if that probability is high enough (or the probability of seeing this naturally is low enough) you state that that with some p-value (often 0.05) the difference you are seeing due to smoking and not natural radnomness
[02:24:02] <qergle> this is question for doctor, but i'm imagining ekg of cardiac patient vs ekg of normal patient. sample of 1 is enough to see anomaly.
[02:24:50] <qergle> i don't know what samples at 100hz for 60s means though
[02:24:52] <somiaj> yea, a sample size of 2 is still often considered a bit small, but you could ask what is the probabiltiy of the probablity we see from the smokers given you assume the stat from the non-smokers is an accurate measurement of the sample tats
[02:26:15] <qergle> 60hz for 60s means 60^2 samples over the course of 1 minute?

[02:26:51] <qergle> could be 1 minute at 5am when smoker is deep asleep and his bp is that of non-smoker
[02:27:17] <somiaj> though yea, if this was a question fora  doctor, then they have a fairly good idea what the normal bps for humans are after years and years of testing, and could tell by looking at that if it was outside of normal.
[02:27:54] <qergle> or could be 1m when non-smoker is doing jumping jacks and exercise-induced bp rise mimics soker.

[03:33:53] <phao> Hi. Sorry for the off-topic (I think) sort of question. I'm not really sure if it even makes sense, tbh. The general question I have in mind here is: is numerical analysis sort of relevant? I have the impression everything under the umbrella of numerical analysis is sort of old, like it was done in the 60s or 70s and that was it.
[03:34:47] <phao> I mean, I'm sure I'm wrong here. I was just looking for some opinions on this.

[03:49:14] <isekaijin> This is just a conjecture, but I think there are two main reasons why numerical methods are not so hot anymore. For pure mathematicians, they are too concrete, and these days only super abstract things are fashionable. And for users of mathematics, these days computers are fast enough that you can use inefficient methods and still solve your problems just fine.
[03:52:48] <phao> Well, I guess what you're saying makes sense.
[03:53:04] <phao> Research level stuff in numerical analysis seem to be related to like "huge models" like weather prediction.
[03:53:14] <bosspotato> alternatively because you don't have to implement anything yourself anymore

[11:02:15] <brownorange> Is it possible that Provability is only expressible as a property and not as a truth predicate? Maybe ~Prov(a) or Prov(a) is not in fact to do with a propositional L.E.M. Thus unprovable wffs that are embedding such notions are a vindication of the formal system being correct and should not be used to demonstrate incompleteness.

[13:01:52] <brownorange> (a <-> !a).  behold as you descend in madness of what to do about 'a' being compared to its own negation. oh wait we know from law of non-contradiction it's just a false formula. yet somehow if we package this into something of a more fixed point nature people run around talking about true but unprovables
[13:03:06] <river> chaotic vs predictable
[13:03:30] <brownorange> In reality there is no conflict of something wrong saying something true of itself. Consider False -> True for example.   yet "This sentence is false" gets so much love

[17:00:43] <cherim> Your question is not really about some objective mathematical fact but about a convention like "will people understand what is meant if I write XXX under the summation sign"?
[17:01:36] <cherim> sum_{j=1}^{n},   sum_{j \in S},  sum_{j^2= s (mod p)},    sum_{j: (i, j) \in B} are all OK
[17:02:14] <sgara> there must be a definition of summatory
[17:02:19] <cherim> No
[17:02:52] <cherim> It's notation everybody is free to introduce, not a first-class object
[17:03:56] <sgara> \sum_{i \in A} \sum_{(i,j) \in B} x_{ij} = 0
[17:04:07] <sgara> for example here the sum is behaving like a quantifier
[17:04:19] <cherim> As you can see in the above examples, it's not even visible what the "summation variable" sometimes
[17:04:41] <cherim> sum_{j^2 = s (mod p)} -- are we summing over j, s, or p?
[17:05:04] <cherim> This is standard sloppiness, perfectly usual

[21:04:50] <Guest19> Totality of the positive integers tells us that we have one of the following: equality, <, or >. That is, we have either u dot alpha > u dot beta or both u dot alpha = u dot beta and alpha >_sigma beta.
[21:05:11] <Guest19> For well-orderedness, okay, I will explicitly state the theorem.

[21:14:29] <int-e> Guest19: looks better, but shouldn't you have three cases though
[21:14:31] <Z-module> you can do the reductions at any point, makes no difference
[21:14:58] <Z-module> Z -> Z/mZ  is a ring homomorphism, and matrix multiplication uses nothing but finite combos of + and *

[21:41:55] <int-e> Guest19: Sure, I'd be happy to call it obvious and leave it at that. But if you embark on a proof at all, it should properly link the ingredients (totality of > on Z, and totality of >_s) to what you're showing (totality of >_us).
[21:42:35] <mh_le> Z-module: oh nice

[23:06:37] <droid3> It probably will be easier to do the math symbols take a picture of the generated latex and embed it in a word document

[23:07:40] <cherim> Write in a usual text editor, compile and read the pdf
[23:08:11] <droid3> Well even the latex editors i can do math symbols and statements well . Its just when i try to combined wording/sentences / all the non math part of a book or proof. That the layout gets screwed and i am wasting tons of time in figuring out how to get the layout write because the latex is screwing the over all layout.
[23:08:17] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[23:08:48] <cherim> LaTeX is not screwing the layout, it has proper typographic norms built in
[23:09:09] <cherim> It screws you if you try to make the document look not like how it should by the standard
[23:09:47] <droid3> "Write in a usual text editor, compile and read the pdf"  cherim what do you mean by a usual text editor like notepad , gedit those type of things rather then a rdf ms word/ libre office document.
[23:10:40] <droid3> \document tags are not the math formulas latex symbols...etc
[23:10:49] <cherim> I use Sublime Text (left half of screen), hit Ctrl-B, and it gives me the pdf of the current text (right half of the screen). No switching windows even
[23:11:07] <droid3> but latex has alot of document , paragraph ,...etc stuff that does effect the layout.
[23:11:09] <cherim> TeXworks use similar layout I think
[23:11:25] <cherim> This is not #math I am afraid
[23:11:39] <droid3> Well word or any text editor i can type up the non math stuff like writting a book.
[23:11:59] <droid3> And then just go back to taking images of the latex renders and embedding them in there.
[23:12:21] <droid3> Is that what most book authors do for math/science books ???
[23:12:38] <pazof> book editors use LaTeX
[23:13:24] <droid3> ya for the math and science formulas but do they do latex the whole document or using latex just to generate the math/science symbols that they take images of?
[23:13:48] <dila> droid3: it's not so bad if you use SVG format for the images
[23:13:54] <pazof> for any kind of book
[23:14:01] <dila> as when you export your document to PDF the SVG images will scale
[23:14:11] <droid3> Because i find just using latex to create the math/science symbols and take pictures of them is much easier. Then trying to write the whole document under latex.
[23:14:45] <droid3> Is there any benifit in writting the whole document in latex then just the math /science formula and taking pictures of it and embedding the pictures?
[23:16:00] <droid3> dila i was taking regular raster based pictures like png , gif ,...etc is there away to take vector based pictures aka in svg format. Still have to figure this out or look into this.

[23:17:01] <dila> in libreoffice i use the libreoffice math plugin, so those are "inline" in the document. but for other diagrams i add those as SVG. then when i export to PDF everything scales
[23:17:22] <cherim> Publishing companies use LaTeX for the whole book
[23:17:38] <droid3> Seeing as vector graphics like svg can be resized to any size one wants. That seems like for editors it be fine.
[23:18:03] <dila> for viewers maybe. the SVG is still really not something you can edit by hand
[23:18:06] <cherim> You can completely specify how to resize included graphics in LaTeX
[23:18:09] <cuppajoeman> I'm trying to understand why the # of ways you can roll two dice st their sum k in {2, 3, ..., 12} is equal to 6  - | 7 - x |

[23:21:16] <droid3> just a hypothetical question
[23:21:21] <river> so you're claiming that k = 6  - | 7 - k | ?
[23:22:01] <cherim> Technically this may be possible, it's the same as if you just sent them a handwritten manuscript
[23:22:09] <cherim> They won't use any of your formatting
[23:22:11] <cuppajoeman> so if you roll two dice and their sum is k = 8 then it says that the number of ways to roll two dice to get that sum is equal to 6 - | 7 - 8 |  = 5
[23:22:27] <cuppajoeman> wait
[23:22:29] <cuppajoeman> that seems bad...
[23:22:32] <cherim> But they must really want to have your book for that

[23:23:55] <river> cuppajoeman, okay, so before getting to that - do you understand exactly what the setup here is? and what the notation means, like what Pr[X = x] means?
[23:23:56] <droid3> Then just embed the latex as pictures where i need them / want to position them.

[23:24:33] <cherim> You just come to the channel with some idea, and retype it 20 times regardless of what people say
[23:24:53] <droid3> Well i am just asking cherim would it matter.
[23:25:09] <river> cuppajoeman, yeah, so lets do an example Pr[X = 2] is the probability that the sum of the two dice is 2, and this can only happen in exactly one way: 1 + 1 - so Pr[X = 2] = 1/something - what is that something?
[23:25:38] <cherim> If this is a real question about publishing something, then the answer is that you should discuss with the publisher first

[23:25:47] <cuppajoeman> 36, and that's the total number of ways you can roll two dice (I'm interested in the numerator tho)

[23:26:00] <droid3> I doubt it. But was throwing it out there.

[23:26:16] <river> cuppajoeman, yep, so now what about Pr[X = 3], in how many ways can we roll a 3? and what is the probability then
[23:26:28] <cherim> Some even use word as base format (none of the decent ones though)
[23:26:38] <cuppajoeman> yeah, so apparently te number of ways we can roll a 3 is 6 - | 7 - 3|
[23:26:46] <cuppajoeman> but I'm trying to grapple with that formula
[23:26:50] <cherim> But if you want the "normal" course, I told you what everybody does
[23:26:58] <cuppajoeman> 6 - | x - 7 |
[23:27:03] <river> cuppajoeman, wait, dont use the formula
[23:27:07] <cuppajoeman> sure
[23:27:08] <river> just figure it out from scratch
[23:27:11] <cuppajoeman> yeah

[23:31:15] <cuppajoeman> Ok
[23:31:23] <cuppajoeman> Ah ok right
