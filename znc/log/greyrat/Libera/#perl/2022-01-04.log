[16:29:14] <ilmari> "working" as in running, and demonstrates your problem
[16:29:35] <Altreus> bet it's not simple
[16:31:40] <Guest73> I would like to send out a test email via button. When clicking the button the function testMail should be called. The function works, but not in connection with the button.

[16:31:53] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Perlbot Pastebin ]
[16:32:26] <Guest73> I thought that by clicking I can simply call the function
[16:34:15] <ilmari> if testMail() is a server-side perl function, that won't work. onclick events run in the browser, so can only call javascript functions already delivered to the browser
[16:34:25] <Altreus> that would call the JS function testMail
[16:37:09] <Guest73> Yes its serverside. The emails and the names are taken from the database.
[16:37:32] <Guest73> So it is only possible with detours
[16:39:18] <Altreus> If that means you have to set up a special URL that will send an email based on POST data, and then get the browser to send a POST request to that, then yet
[16:39:20] <Altreus> yes*
[16:45:42] <xenu> server side scripts (cgi, psgi, whatever) are basically programs that output text (in your case html) which has no meaning to them at all
[16:46:14] <xenu> notice that when you view the source code of the page in the browser (ctrl+u) the perl code is not there

[21:41:52] <Altreus> It would not be unreasonable, I think, to hypothesise that people not using cpanm and people not upgrading perl are overlapping sets
[21:41:55] <LeoNerd> E.g. I got a bunch of folks onto 5.34 because of try/catch
[21:42:10] <zkrd> So I started with Mojolicious and I have a question about the paths. In this example, get '/' => sub ($c) { $c->render(template => 'index.html.ep') };

[22:24:10] <mb> but I think it might be that a considerable part of those downloads are for CI systems testing if your perl module still works on < 5.24 :D
[22:24:42] <leont> The distribution strongly suggests that it's mostly systemperl

[22:30:21] <leont> You can also find RHEL6 in the stats, but it's tiny at 1.1%
[22:30:35] <ilmari> rhel 7 (thus amazon linux) has 5.16
[22:32:20] <mb> my $job lives in Ubuntu-land and we have mostly 18.04 and 20.04 and 18.04 already comes with perl 5.26 
[22:32:52] <ilmari> huh, even amazon linux 2 has 5.16
[22:32:54] <xenu> that centos 8 drama probably made some people stay on centos 7 (or equivalents) longer

[22:34:45] <Grinnz> 13:13:57 <xenu> so i guess what i should do is write a bot which will make lots of fake requests masquerading as modern perls
[22:35:04] <Grinnz> the real number is probably older, because this is only people that know cpanm exists

[22:36:17] <Grinnz> I've learned to be less optimistic about people finding out things we don't tell them about
[22:36:25] <xenu> cpanm isn't ideal, the main problem is that it's dead
[22:36:27] <Grinnz> i.e. things you only know if you show up here
[22:36:48] <xenu> the author rewrote it and then he kinda gave up
[22:37:00] <mb> Yeah I noticed
[22:37:07] <mb> I guess 'cpm' is most modern now? 
[22:37:35] <mb> and also I noticed the good old 'cpan' client has gotten a little nicer in the last dev release

[22:39:06] <mb> File::Fetch is in core perl, because it came with CPANPLUS which was in core at some point. CPANPLUS got evicted but File::Fetch stayed but it's really not great
[22:39:59] *** Quits: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.231.228) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:40:01] <xenu> TIL it exists
[22:40:40] <mb> it's _not_ great, it tries to be smart about downloading stuff using curl or wget or fetch or HTTP::Tiny but there's no good error handling
[22:41:18] <mb> I think what's best is to just use HTTP::Tiny -- only that requires IO::Socket::SSL for HTTPS
[22:41:39] <leont> Yeah, we need the fallback for ssl bootstrapping
[22:41:48] <mb> cpanm has "HTTP::Tinyish" which has also fallback to curl for https, if there is no HTTPS
[22:42:07] <mb> and since Windows also ships with curl.exe nowadays, that's great
[22:42:24] <simcop2387> mb: cpm and cpanm are the most modern.  cpm sometimes has issues still with some modules last i tried it.  basically trying cpm first and then cpanm if that fails works for 99.999999% of things
[22:42:45] <simcop2387> usually it's because of a module having an improperly declared dependency or something along those lines
[22:43:16] <mb> Plus, there is this PR for a 'fetch' API using Windows own httplib --> https://github.com/perl-libwin32/win32/pull/30
[22:43:18] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Add Win32::HttpGetFile by craigberry · Pull Request #30 · perl-libwin32/win32 · GitHub ]
[22:43:44] <mb> that is going into the Win32 module, which is a core perl module, so that will become part of core perl on Win32
[22:44:27] <xenu> the best thing about cpanm is that it doesn't support interactive build scripts which resulted in them mostly disappearing from cpan
[22:45:11] <mb> because Win32::HttpGetFile uses winhttp, it also uses the Windows cert trust things and it even has HTTP2 support on modern enough Windowses :D
[22:45:48] <zgu> all those modules with an InstallShield wizard that draws a dithered navy-blue-and-gray gradient across the screen behind it are gone?
[22:45:49] <zgu> sad
[22:46:14] <xenu> we really should make IO::Socket::SSL backend agnostic and implement SChannel bindings
[22:46:19] <xenu> sadly i'm too lazy to do it myself
[22:47:32] <mb> Yeah _or_ make a GOODGOOD library that builds with libcurl? Because libcurl can do schannel
[22:48:08] <mb> I think there is _something_ on cpan that uses libcurl but I don't know if it's any good and it's definitely not widely used
[22:48:14] <xenu> well sockets aren't being used just for http
[22:48:34] <mb> Yeah but I don't want to bother with LDAP or POP3 over SSL :D
[22:48:48] <xenu> also it would make the already existing http clients work without any changes
[22:48:50] <zgu> there was someone in here a while ago trying to use curl from perl
[22:49:14] <zgu> of course it was an XY problem, the X being an HTTP API and the Y being the command-line examples for it using curl
[22:49:26] <mb> Yeah xenu, you're right, if you would fix up IO::Socket::SSL to also use schannel where applicable, HTTP::Tiny and LWP and.... are all of a sudden using schannel

[22:52:54] <mb> so you think you could trick craigberry writing schannel in IO::Socket::SSL ?
