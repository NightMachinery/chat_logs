[00:32:53] <Dagmar> Well, _those_ parts we know pay attention when you tell them to install their files to an alternate rootdir
[00:33:11] <Dagmar> Otherwise there'd be an endless parade of bug reports from having them actually taint people's build environments
[00:33:12] <lacroix> heh. gmcastil. for almost everything you want to do you should *not* do anything LFS tells you
[00:33:23] <lacroix> are you building a distribution not based on another distro?  no?  are you writing a toolchain for a completely new architecture?  no?  LFS is not for you.
[00:33:32] <lacroix> (and if the answer to either is "yes": then LFS is not for you, you know how to do things properly, instead)
[00:33:41] <onelegend> well I'm building a custom environment
[00:33:43] <lacroix> if you want to build a simply native compiler, you just follow the GCC instructions.  they work, and they work well.
[00:33:47] <Dagmar> lacroix: Not the whole book, just the build order they're using for the bootstrap
[00:33:55] <lacroix> if you want to build a simple cross compiler, you get a sysroot (perhaps from an existing distro), and you follow the GCC install instructions
[00:34:03] <onelegend> if you want to compile from scratch, but still use a distro repo, check out debian from scratch

[00:34:43] <onelegend> how do you compile with clang?

[00:38:14] <lacroix> so, you can build binutils independent of anything else.  the same is true for GCC in fact

[00:40:23] <Dagmar> gladys: It's only hard if you don't follow explicit directions well.  If you follow directions well, it's just very time-consuming

[04:38:22] <Echoz> At the end of the day your end product is two speakers that each take a single analog signal, so anything that software does could also be stored in any kind of recording requiring no special software. Usually "virtual surround" is just some tweaking of balance, maybe a reverb effect

[04:41:43] <MinusOne> CodexVeritas, if it is running really new hardware, there could be devices without mainstream linux drivers though

[04:42:08] <ionface> LjL, the last time I installed linux on ancient hardware it detected everything and was way faster than whatever bloat was on previously, the problems you'll have will probably be hardware, like USB compatibility with your peripherals

[04:47:57] <ionface> yeah, "standard stereo drivers with Dolby or DTS surround sound virtualization" and that gentoo link describes it, the dts is already compiled in to vlc and is passed through to my sound card and crappy headset

[04:49:32] <MinusOne> Echoz, okay, sounds like what he is after then
[04:49:45] <LjL> MinusOne, actually uuuh binaural sound is a thing, how good it's going to sound depends both on the implementation but also on the kind of headphones you will end up using and how well they match... but ideally at least, headphones are next to your ears unlike speakers (duh) so it's possible to recreate the sound that something "coming from behind" makes. with stereo speakers it would be impossible because you can't control for the room they're in. anyway, aside from
[04:49:46] <LjL> theory, you can actually do this with ALSA and PulseAudio... damn, i actually did it, can't say it sounded magnificent but it did make a difference but my memory is pretty bad so i'd have to dig up how it was done. i might have saved a reddit post about it fro though if Echoz can wait until i find it maybe that'll be useful.

[04:54:25] <Echoz> It's real, but it requires a surround source to work, and whether it sounds better or not I guess is debatable
[04:55:17] <LjL> ionface, in general though, "binaural sound" refers to something slightly different, although it's close. namely, you *record* binaural sound in stereo by having good microphones mounted inside (usually) a fake head of an appropriate material, where the ears are. that way whatever you record is going to receive the same changes you'd get in your actual head, except that we don't all have heads shaped the exact same way, so your mileage may vary. oh the other hand with
[04:55:17] <LjL> "virtual surround" you use a head-related transfer function to simulate that in software when you have surround input

[05:08:11] <LjL> Dagmar, that sounds more annoying to fix though than this is. this is done through PulseAudio without touching ALSA, and, to the extent it does "work", it did work for me by just following those steps. what might drive someone nuts about it, i suspect, is the wide choice of downloadable HRTF parameters, one could spend a week listening to front and back sounds and figuring out which set gives the most convincing output, heh

[06:35:57] <ionface> fructose, you can't use a fitbit? I've seen arduinos with heartbeat sensors, I wouldn't want to sleep in one though, I would set up a security camera with motion activation or something less wearable
[06:36:36] <bparker> I wake up when my alarm goes off, that's enough of a signal for me
[06:36:54] <fructose> ionface: I haven't ruled out a Fitbit, but I wanted to see if there were any options that were better for Linux users, etc.
[06:37:03] <Psi-Jack> I use an Alexa event triggered on the alarm that handles automation in the house. Because the alarm goes off, I wake up, I stop said alarm, it turns on lights needed to wake up more, and lead me and the dogs out to the first morning potty time.

[07:08:10] <Psi-Jack> The problem with Ubuntu LTS is, once it's released, it's pretty much stale for 2 years.

[09:32:12] <ayecee> Scisista: ah. i guess one of those distros where it does work would be a sane dist.

[11:39:19] <Scisista> in the meantime I'll try searching on Google though
[11:39:20] <p`> Scisista: indeed probably just follow the guide.  probably something like mkdir /boot/efi; mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi; grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi;

[11:40:46] <p`> just keep it consistent, it's only needed for the grub-install
[11:41:40] <hexnewbie> ad__: Look at the source code of libinput from libinput-tools for hints? I assume it reads the properties from /sys/class/input/event[0-9]*/device/capabilities

[23:17:07] <TheGuestMovie> For those wondering what the Thread Director is, essentially it is a new technology in Alder Lake that provides feedback to the OS that in turn helps the Windows 11 scheduler to efficiently assign the workloads such that more complex ones composed of vector instructions, among others, go to the Performance Core (P-core), while lighter scalar
[23:17:08] <TheGuestMovie> instructions and background tasks are sent to the Efficient Core (E-core). However, the feedback is dynamic and it can adapt depending on the workload present on each core.

[23:19:40] <pnbeast> jackiee, postfix is, by general reckoning, quite a bit nicer than sendmail.  Certainly, we switched to it quickly, around 2000, I think.  So, do you think configuring postix is obvious?
[23:19:43] <bitonic> is there a reason why `vmsplice` would return anything different from the length of the buffer?

[23:20:29] <[[R]]> galacticbeat: i assume your interenet connection is broken... but you're on IRC... so im confused
[23:20:35] <TheGuestMovie> A cynical take would be that Intel's marketing team decided to have 8 proper cores on their top latest CPU, and 8 "efficiency cores", so they can claim it's a 16-core CPU in marketing material
[23:20:35] <bitonic> from reading the source it seems to me that it always returns the buffer len: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/119c85055d867b9588263bca59794c872ef2a30e/fs/splice.c#L245

[23:41:29] <Psi-Jack> lovetruth: Actually no, VPN is NOT a protocol./
[23:41:31] <Sauvin> Guest93, so, go brag about it somewhere else.
[23:41:31] <Khaytsus> I wonder if this is the same idiot that in in #android the other day saying he has dozens of phones because the CIA tracks him
[23:41:32] <evilop> specially when 9 out of 10 of the proxies are actually shells for various 3 letter agencies
[23:41:34] <Guest93> 2 Tor ROuters, 1 doublehop VPN router
[23:41:40] <p`> Phantom: have you tried v3, out of curiosity?
[23:41:49] <Guest93> I setup my VPNs on VPSs for my home router
[23:41:49] <TheGuestMovie> VPN/middlemen work when your client isn't sending a unique identifier (the IMEI, unique OS installation, MAC address, etc) to the mothership every minute
[23:41:59] <ayecee> Khaytsus: could be, it does seem like a very fingerprint-able brand of aggression.
[23:42:00] <p`> Phantom: or do you need the extra access controls
[23:42:04] <hexnewbie> 10 rotates VPNs with 10 VPN hops, that would be 100 VPNs in total. Sounds reasonable.
[23:42:05] <esselfe> Guest93: if the law has to find you they will because all vpn disclose personal information to authorities if they have to
[23:42:06] <Guest93> Yeah I aknowledge the possiblity of FBI VPNs
[23:42:07] <Guest93> etc
[23:42:14] <Phantom> p`: I shall try the downgrade..
[23:42:26] <Guest93> Tor is the first layer
[23:42:37] <Guest93> so all the proceeding VPNs only see Tor exit node IPs
[23:42:44] <Guest93> or other VPN exit ips
[23:42:51] <Guest93> so the VPNs never see my home wifi IP
[23:43:08] <TheGuestMovie> I think if you want to avoid surveillance, use one of those open ROMs without Google/Samsung apps in it, and with a firewall app that blocks internet access by default, except to a handful of whitelisted apps

[23:44:22] <TheGuestMovie> Khaytsus: like Pine or whatever. Not sure if I mean Pine. There's also ROMs like LineageOS that always support flagship models.
[23:44:24] <Guest93> Does anybody have some idea why my 2 favorite VPNs arnt working
[23:44:29] <rascul> no

[23:44:50] <Khaytsus> TheGuestMovie: Pine is shit though
[23:44:53] <Guest93> My VPN connects but then I have no internet
[23:44:54] <ayecee> Guest93: yes. already said. also, not phone support here.
[23:45:04] <Guest93> Well, okayecee you wont help me
[23:45:06] <Guest93> someone else can
[23:45:10] <Sauvin> But not here.
[23:45:13] <TheGuestMovie> so why are you asking "does anyone know why my favorite VPNs aren't working", 30 minutes after it became clear you're not getting an answer here, and after all the context is lost in scrollback?
[23:45:14] <rascul> not sure if anyone can

[23:45:25] <Guest93> someone must know
[23:45:28] <Sauvin> And one about to depart if the crap doesn't settle.
[23:45:28] <lovetruth> Psi-Jack, I know English is not my native language... And I know the "protocol" is something else usually in networking. I'm actually just using the word "protocol" trying to describe just a "set of rules" - by which you can implement - like IPSec, SSL-based and so on
[23:45:30] <TheGuestMovie> No, there's like 20 of us, and 1780 idlers
[23:45:35] <Guest93> yeah
[23:45:43] <TheGuestMovie> bots that sauvin sets up to feel like a king
[23:45:53] <Guest93> So someone said it could be my kernel drivers
[23:45:56] <Guest93> How can I update them
[23:46:07] <Sauvin> Guest93, you need a phone support channel. This ain't it.
[23:46:09] <Psi-Jack> lovetruth: That would be VPN. Not a protocol. Protocols would be more specific like, IPSec with ESP, IKEv1, IKEv2. etc. Wireguard. OpenVPN, etc.
[23:46:23] <TheGuestMovie> unironically, not as a "go fuck yourself" thing, the best people to help you are the VPN providers who have probably received many technical support requests about this already

[23:47:15] <TheGuestMovie> I respect the trolls that piss people off, but you just waste time without pissing people off
[23:47:31] <TheGuestMovie> it's like some benign troll that is just nothing but disappointment
[23:47:31] <Guest93> Im asking a question
[23:47:38] <TheGuestMovie> yeah, and I'm ignoring you. adios.
[23:47:42] <Guest93> Once I connect to a VPN, no websites load.
[23:47:44] <Psi-Jack> And this is why filtering Guest* is so benefitial.
[23:47:58] <TheGuestMovie> Psi-Jack: not *guest* though, right?
[23:48:01] <Guest93> I have a quesiton, I need an answer, its that easy.
