[03:56:07] <Torr> emanuele6: New client? 
[03:59:55] <emanuele6> no, i sometimes write stuff in my readline and then play with ^A ^E ^K ^W 
[04:00:35] <emanuele6> and i write stuff with hjkl because they are easy to press
[04:01:11] <emanuele6> ^J is equivalent to the return key (because it sends LF) apparently
[04:02:09] <emanuele6> i pressed the ctrl key too early and ended up pressing ^J which sent the stuff i had in my readline
[04:05:12] <Torr> Dear me, what an inquisitive lad. 
[04:12:37] <emanuele6> readlines are too much fun :D
