[01:08:51] <maret> I would like to confirm one thing. I have a table with two columns address, entity_id. I am using insert into address(address, entity) values (...,...) on conflict(address) DO UPDATE SET address = EXCLUDED.address, entity_id = EXCLUDED.entity_id;` My goal is to insert new address and in case there is an existing just update its entity_id. I guess SET address = EXCLUDED.address, is not necessary. Still is my approach sound? I am asking
[01:08:51] <maret>  because seems like entity_id is not updated sometimes. Might be related to something else but wanted to make sure sql is correct

[01:11:19] <peerce> address is the PK to this table?
[01:11:58] <peerce> and yeah, if the conflict is on address, that field already has the 'new' value, so you just update the /other/ field(s) which are presumably changing to something different than they were

[02:17:21] <gajus> What's the reason for the:
[02:17:21] <gajus> source database "contra" is being accessed by other users
[02:17:32] <gajus> when trying to setup a new database using template and is there a way to avoid it?
[02:17:51] <gajus> referring to `CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE contra`
[02:17:54] <ilmari> make sure thre are no connections to the template database
[02:18:22] <gajus> well, there are, many – the context is that test runner is trying to make a copy of the database to run its own tests
[02:18:44] <ilmari> use a separate template database that doesn't allow  connections
[02:20:07] <ilmari> alter database contra_template with allow_connections false is_template true;
[02:20:28] <ilmari> (after you've populated contra_template as desired)

[02:22:18] <gajus> doh... I was connecting to 'contra' database. That was not intentional. I thought it was the `CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE contra` that's causing connection.

[10:44:52] <maret> any please can take a look at http://tatiyants.com/pev/#/plans/plan_1646723473408. I have a query againts a huge table (1.8 billion rows). I've changed increased several default values (shared_buffers to 25% of total RAM),  effective_cache_size to 50% of total ram , work memory to 64MB , default_statistics_target to 10000 and random_page_cost to 1.1. I am running queries on persona ubuntu server with 64 GB ram and relatively fast SSDs.
[10:44:52] <maret>  Curious if there is some low hanging fruit or I need to rethink while table and approach

[16:03:04] <Myon> but that's new stuff, not from 2010
[16:04:18] <ilmari> Guest52: that presenstation is 12 years old. the pgfoundry site linked there no longer exist, but the extension does exist on PGXN: https://pgxn.org/dist/temporal/. but that is 9 years old, so probably doesn't work with modern postgres versions. as Myon pointed out, the "periods" extension is the most current approach to temporal tables

[16:07:52] <ilmari> yeah, for that specific use case you don't need periods
[16:07:56] <ilmari> ranges do the job

[16:17:37] <Berge> Well, you want to store absolute points in time, hence use the "with time zone" data types.
[16:17:47] <ne2k> Guest52, timestamp is a picture of a clock and and a calendar. timestamptz is an actual point in time

[16:19:11] <Myon> just pretend "timestamp" doesn't exist
[16:19:25] <ne2k> Berge, they are "a time and date, taken together with the knowledge of a timezone, to give an exact point in time". but yes, the name does tend to imply that the timezeone is stored
[16:20:42] <Berge> ne2k: yeah, they take inputs with time zones to do the right thing

Lessons learned from it are called "experience". I don't need to rememebr now specific cases where "x" is bad. maybe it bit be 16 years ago. doesn't matter. I can remember that "don't do x".

[19:26:58] <SteveR> Hi there,
[19:26:58] <SteveR>   I have many columns in the db table, but out of that i am trying to search and get the listing when someone searches by the name
[19:26:59] <SteveR>   if we dont find any result for that, i want to search the keyword from the description column.
[19:26:59] <SteveR>   is my queries correct?
[19:27:02] <SteveR> https://dpaste.org/Zrb0
[19:27:15] <ilmari> ncouture: "user" is a reserved function-like keyword that returns the current user, and `select * from function();` works even if it's not a set-returning function
[19:27:44] <ncouture> http://ix.io/3RHx
[19:28:00] <ncouture> ^ depesz
[19:28:14] <depesz> SteveR: what you showed are not queries. it's code in some (not-sql) language.
[19:28:28] <SteveR> thats right, these are not queries. there are ORMs
[19:28:53] <depesz> SteveR: but it makes me wonder: what willhappen if Name variable will contain: '; drop table runbook_records; --
[19:29:23] <SteveR> i have not covered those kind of corner cases yet
[19:29:41] <depesz> ncouture: so, you're connected as "user-tmp", and it looks that you'd have to be "foobar" to be able to read from the table.
[19:30:03] <depesz> SteveR: these are not "corner cases". this is common, and widely known problem, so called "sql injection"
[19:30:11] <ilmari> SteveR: where name like $1 or description like $1 or whatever like $1

[19:34:12] <ncouture> what is that called? "Access privileges" ?
[19:34:51] <ncouture> why does it need to apply to "root"-type accounts? or is this only a Google Cloud concept they named "cloudsqlsuperuser" ?

[23:44:24] <xocolatl> create table episodeids (id bigint primary key generated always as identity, episode_id varchar(14) not null references episodes);
[23:44:58] <kjetilho> but... adding a column to a table with 80 million rows surely can't take a day?
[23:45:33] <Petruchio> I'm just impressed you've done 80 million episodes.
[23:45:38] <xocolatl> probably not, but it will cause quite a bit of chaos
[23:45:44] <peerce> depends.   if the column has to be populated with a value, it can require rewriting every tuple.
[23:46:07] <peerce> if the column just has a default() or is NULL, then its nearly instant, once it can get a exclusive access lock on the table.
[23:46:21] <peerce> if there's lock contention, that can drag out.
[23:46:28] <podverse-mitch> @xocolatl ok cool. that's actually close to what I had tried before...but I thought maybe I needed to do an ALTER TABLE episodes ADD FOREIGN KEY or something like that.
[23:46:30] <kjetilho> well, it can be done in stages.  first add the column with default NULL, then populate them in batches, then add the unique index?

[23:47:13] <peerce> 80 million episodes, wow, is that like every TV show since the 1940s, or something?
[23:47:43] <kjetilho> there are many podcasts with thousands of episodes
[23:47:46] <podverse-mitch> And yeah Podverse has ~80 million episodes because we basically clone the Podcast Index, which has 4.5+ million. We have our own parser setup but get notifications from them to sync data.

[23:48:00] <peerce> oh, podcasts.
[23:48:17] <peerce> 99% of which are noise.
[23:48:26] <kjetilho> heh, so the average podcast has 10-20 episodes? :)
[23:49:05] <podverse-mitch> It varies widely. And over a million of them might be junk/pirated feeds from Anchor.fm XD

[23:51:35] <podverse-mitch> how could i "populate them in batches"? with a SQL command? or like a command line script?

[23:54:50] <podverse-mitch> yeah, so, I've been wrestling with adding Manticore (fork of Sphinx) search support for the Episodes table. We already have Manticore working and indexing the Podcasts table, but it dies with a RAM out of memory error every time I try to run the same index as podcasts on the episodes table. I assume this is just because of the size of the tables 4.5 million vs 80 million. I've wrestled with this problem 7 days in a row an
[23:55:24] <podverse-mitch> if anyone is curious about our Manticore config... https://github.com/podverse/podverse-ops/blob/master/manticore/manticore.conf#L47

[23:57:50] <podverse-mitch> Manticore has a config parameter called sql_range_query which AFIAK would allow the indexer to run incrementally, like 1000 episodes at a time, *but* it needs a SERIAL column so it can do 1-1000, 1001-2000, etc.
[23:58:04] <xocolatl> eww
[23:58:24] <podverse-mitch> and I think that might solve our out of memory issues...but alas I made the Episode schema over 3 years ago and never included a SERIAL column on it.
[23:58:54] <peerce> have you tried postgres native full text search ?
[23:59:09] <peerce> a lot simpler than maintaining multiple disparate database systems
[23:59:29] <podverse-mitch> The episodes do have a primary key, but they are a VARCHAR(14) that uses this library shortid that generates a nice looking ID...in hindsight I would have kept shortid
[23:59:47] <podverse-mitch> I mean, kept it, but probably used a SERIAL as primary
