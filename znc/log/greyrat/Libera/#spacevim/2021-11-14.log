[16:34:22] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> @ultrablack_:matrix.org The default linter is clang command.
[17:18:02] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Yeah, but that linter is buggy and doesn't highlight everything. The syntax checking should also be done by clang, but in some other plugin like ale or whatever. Neomake is broken in that regard.
[17:26:24] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> hmm, it works well for me. is there any reproduce step?
[17:26:34] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> or a simple project to test.
[17:26:52] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Well could you try my config and send me yours?
[17:27:11] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> hm I don't have a sample project right now
[17:27:22] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> https://github.com/wsdjeg/DotFiles
[17:27:30] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> this is my config
[17:27:31] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> ty
[17:29:13] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> the question is, why neomake do not work for you. do you have a `.clang` file in the root of your project?
[17:30:05] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Not yet, but it should still work, at least with partial syntax checking
[17:30:30] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> https://spacevim.org/layers/lang/c/
[17:30:47] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> I need reproduce step thouth.
[17:30:51] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> I would also like to change this to a compile_commands.json file, because I used that with my old vim config and I don't know how to automatically create a .clang file
[17:32:13] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Well here is a bad utils file
[17:32:15] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> [utils.cpp](https://gitter.ems.host/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/UievpWuqEaytNNbkAerftMIV)
[17:32:22] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Doesn't work. Nomatter the file
[17:32:57] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> hmm, currently the `lang#c` layer do not support `compile_commands.json` file.
[17:33:14] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Bruh. That's the only file that you can automatically create with cmake
[17:33:20] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> for new feature request, you can open new issue.
[17:35:53] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Is there even a tool to create .clang files?
[17:37:17] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> no.
[17:37:38] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> bruh why would you use .clang files then. Time to make a feature request...
[17:38:26] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> this is a old feature of some vim plugin.
[17:39:26] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> Rip-Rip/clang_complete

[20:03:00] <SpaceVimBot> <RenzoTincopa> how do i move the nerdtree from right o left?
[20:03:18] <SpaceVimBot> <RenzoTincopa> hello every one, have a nice Sunday

[23:19:25] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> compile_commands.json does not help with header files
[23:21:57] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> In the end I always create a superset of all include paths and throw them into a compile_commands.txt which is what clangd will be looking for.. and link to it as .clang for the other checkers
[23:23:28] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> Sorry I meant compile_flags.txt https://clangd.llvm.org/design/compile-commands
[23:24:57] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> I once had a script that does that.. but my projects are smaller these days..
[23:25:21] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Understandable ðŸ˜†
[23:26:39] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Okay I think I just completely missed, that you need to give clang some compile flags for it to actually check the syntax, but even after setting those (`clang_flag = ['-Wall', '-Werror', '-Weverything', '-Wshadow', '-Wdouble-promotion', '-Wunused-parameter', '-fsyntax-only', '-Wextra', '-I./']`) it's still not working. What did I miss?
[23:29:13] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> Hum no werror.. an does weverything exist?
[23:29:40] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Well I googled it and that apprently exists
[23:29:58] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> I am unsure about what is the current working directory.. I can have a look
[23:30:06] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Also what do you mean - Werror should exist
[23:32:27] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Oh I just noticed something - This syntax checker is weird and kinda broken
[23:32:58] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> It only checks my syntax when I save the file, but not when I open one. So when there is an error on a file I just opened it does nothing
[23:36:57] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> The lint engines themselves don't seem to like to show errors
