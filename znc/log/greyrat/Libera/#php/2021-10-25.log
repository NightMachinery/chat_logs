[12:20:53] <Intelo> Hi
[12:20:54] <Intelo> While doing integration test for api testing. What is a good way to test? a) make api call inside test code and also directly check (fetch/select) entries in database those were supposed to be created by that api cal. b) in response of real api call, always return json of objects created in database (e.g user created, even if its a GET call and 200
[12:20:54] <Intelo> response might have been ok, just to test what was created, I should return what was inserted / updated in database for each api call c) try to check one api with another api (this might not always be possible). e.g test create user api with user profile api. If user was created successfully, then profile api should return correct data. c) any
[12:20:55] <Intelo> other?
[12:22:46] <deksar> TinoDidriksen: Got it, but let's say a visitor is browsing my website, and her/his session belongs to a child, would that session be terminated let's say in 2500 seconds (if I set it so)?
[12:23:23] <Naktibalda> deksar: sessions don't belong to processes
[12:23:40] <TinoDidriksen> deksar, max_requests has nothing to do with sessions or process length.
[12:24:05] <deksar> I see..
[12:24:38] <Naktibalda> session data is stored in a file by default
[12:26:38] <deksar> so, generally should be activated, as no bad/side effects and even a protection against memory-leaks in weird plugins, scripts, right?
[12:26:39] <TinoDidriksen> max_requests affects how many requests a given child may process before it is restarted. It has no effect on site behavior or load, unless you set it to a very low value so it restarts children all the time. But anything above 100 I doubt you'd be able to detect.
[12:27:17] <deksar> That's clear now! Thank you all. <3

[18:48:29] <The_Blode> I saw the duplication and tended to it though.
[18:48:49] <The_Blode> For each day of the week, I had code duplicated...so I put that into a function and just call it 7 times.
[18:48:53] <The_Blode> That's not smelly right?
[18:51:23] <biberu> The_Blode: one thing to keep in mind when doing is that the callers should change together

[18:52:51] <biberu> The_Blode: suppose that a, b, and c are all calling a function that looks the same, a_f, b_f, and c_f, so you factor that out into f, and a, b, and c now call f directly instead
[18:53:14] <biberu> The_Blode: but then a's requirements change, you update f, and b and c are also affected
[18:53:53] <The_Blode> Oh
[18:53:54] <biberu> The_Blode: sometimes that's fine, sometimes it's not
[18:54:05] <The_Blode> The function calls are very basic

[18:54:26] <The_Blode> But all of the HTML elements are similar but with different days
[18:54:47] <The_Blode> I did violate DRY though...the days of the week had similar logic.

[18:58:11] <The_Blode> May God have mercy on my soul
[18:58:47] <biberu> i don't like how that guideline is usually interpreted
[18:59:05] <The_Blode> I did my error handling in PHP rather than the frontend.
[18:59:06] <biberu> it can lead to some really interesting dependency graphs...
[18:59:15] <The_Blode> Was going to do front and back. Is this prudent?
[18:59:36] <The_Blode> Checking for valid times for a specific day
[19:00:09] <biberu> check it on the frontend if it improves the UX, check it on the backend to verify that your data is sane before working on it
[19:00:28] <biberu> that often means both, for different reasons
[19:00:37] <The_Blode> Thanks biberu I did consider it.
[19:00:55] <The_Blode> This is a good sign for me I think (that is crossed my mind to do both...even if it seems overkill)
[19:01:17] <The_Blode> Just the JavaScript check code is larger than PHP but it's for better UX like you say
[19:01:57] <Nekomander> The_Blode, I use a JS library, so it reduces the amount of work that do.
[19:02:19] <Nekomander> amount of work for me to do*
[19:02:21] <The_Blode> There's only one error from the form.
[19:02:35] <The_Blode> So it won't be that bad but yeah.
[19:02:54] <The_Blode> The only logic error is "If the start time is greater or equal to the end time"
[19:02:57] <The_Blode> Otherwise, it's fine.
[19:03:06] <The_Blode> You can't start before the end.
[19:03:26] <The_Blode> In PHP it was very easy
[19:03:31] <__adrian> "The_Blode> That's not smelly right?" in and of itself, no, that's great. but if you're still doing {$day}_hour then it's still smelly
[19:03:44] <biberu> Nekomander: functional form validation with e.g. fp-ts <3
[19:04:22] <The_Blode> Thanks adrian. Any tips?
[19:04:28] <The_Blode> I didn't quite understand the array example.
[19:04:41] <Nekomander> I have yet to get into TypeScript, it seems to be the direction of where cool projects are gravitating towards.
[19:04:42] <The_Blode> The HTML elements need to be unique preferably related / named with the day
[19:04:53] <__adrian> can you share your current function and/or explain what it's doing in more detail?
[19:05:12] <__adrian> (if you already posted it, sorry, i  missed it)
[19:05:14] <biberu> Nekomander: here also jobs, and your sanity :>
[19:05:26] *** Joins: keine (~textual@108.61.188.99)
[19:05:28] <The_Blode> Yeah sure. Can't say the code as it's in the work repo...but here's the gist
[19:05:38] <Nekomander> Okay. :)
[19:05:45] <The_Blode> We want to record phone calls on certain days of the week between certain times of the day
[19:05:55] <The_Blode> So the form has 7 days, start time and end time.
[19:06:09] <The_Blode> And user can flick the switches, select times from the combo boxes
[19:06:36] <The_Blode> And calls are recorded only on the enabled days between the start and end times
[19:06:48] <__adrian> does your form look like  name="monday[start]"  name="monday[end]"  etc.?
[19:07:00] <The_Blode> id="monday_start_hour"
[19:07:08] <The_Blode> id="monday_start_minute"
[19:07:09] <The_Blode> etc
[19:07:25] <The_Blode> I'm using ids for this to keep the fields unique
[19:07:29] <__adrian> the input would be _much_ simpler and cleaner as an array
[19:07:34] <da_wunder> ^
[19:07:47] <The_Blode> How would this be achieved? Any suggestions please
[19:08:10] <__adrian> instead of <input name="monday_start"/>  you'd do <input name="monday[start]"/>
[19:08:34] <da_wunder> like <input name="monday[start_hour]" /><input name="monday[end_hour]
[19:09:08] <The_Blode> That's a JS array right?
[19:09:13] <__adrian> if you need hours/minutes then i'd say  <input name="mondy[start][hour]"/>
[19:09:15] <__adrian> no
[19:09:19] <__adrian> it's an html input name
[19:09:34] <__adrian> php understands it to mean it should be an array
[19:09:34] <The_Blode> Oh
[19:09:35] <da_wunder> and then you get array like `$data = ['monday' => ['start_hour' => '...', 'end_hour' => '...', ...]... ]
[19:10:10] <The_Blode> How would I upload these elements in my Ajax call?
[19:10:18] <The_Blode> How can I collate them

[19:13:39] <The_Blode> Thanks for the help guys. I will need help from #jquery to implement
[19:13:40] <__adrian> e.g., in your case, if the data's structured as an array, you don't need to use $$variable_variables
[19:14:49] <Nekomander> The_Blode, I would really consider a form library. Unless you're really up to the task of doing the form scripts from scratch. https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=form
[19:15:40] <The_Blode> Yeah I forgot to mention, on the project I'm working on, no framework and no rich libraries.

[19:17:15] <The_Blode> For this piece, it's allowing me to toggle alert boxes and do my Ajax call.
[19:17:20] <da_wunder> but really you should use that array format on your inputs, and then serialize that form on your ajax query and see what you get on your php side
[19:17:29] <The_Blode> Fetch API is a modern version of XMLHTTPrequest?
[19:17:58] <The_Blode> Do I need to use the HTML prop "name" as in your examples? Or can I use ID
[19:18:02] <The_Blode> Or does it matter
[19:19:19] <biberu> it's a new interface for that
[19:20:41] <biberu> and for toggling an alert, e.g. document.querySelector("#foo div.blah > whatever").classList.toggle("some-class") or similar
[19:20:46] <biberu> still no jquery needed
[19:20:46] <__adrian> The_Blode: https://3v4l.org/HiMof
[19:21:21] <The_Blode> I mean, Jquery gives me slideUp/Down too :)
[19:21:30] <__adrian> jq does have a plugin ecosystem.
[19:21:31] <biberu> css gives you that
[19:21:37] <The_Blode> For that UX experience. Not knocking vanilla JS but why make it harder if I have it.
[19:22:02] <__adrian> well, a lot of it isn't really "harder" these days, which is what folks are pointing out
[19:22:10] <The_Blode> Thanks for this example. Let me study it.
[19:22:18] <__adrian> but if you already use it and rely on the plugin ecosystem, ...it's fine
[19:22:19] <da_wunder> yep, I haven't used jquery for years
[19:22:34] <__adrian> https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/  ← good resource
[19:22:53] <biberu> mainly i'd be cautious about guides that use jquery these days, might be out of date
[19:23:04] <Nekomander> The_Blode, https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/is-it-time-to-drop-jquery-essentials-to-learning-javascript-from-a-jquery-background - Use whatever you want, but I wouldn't want to box myself into just jQuery as there are much more better quality stuff available in the JS ecosystem.
[19:23:31] <biberu> if you need it for some plugin and it saves you time *shrug*, but mind the lifecycle of the plugin
[19:23:45] <__adrian> "biberu> mainly i'd be cautious about guides that use jquery these days, might be out of date"  ← indeed
[19:24:16] <The_Blode> It looks great adrian!
[19:24:39] <__adrian> hope it clarifies
[19:24:43] <The_Blode> Well, it's just the project I'm working on is using it. It would take a team discussion to replace Jquery
[19:25:03] <The_Blode> I mean, the only question is passing the array into PHP in the POST array.
[19:25:08] <__adrian> if it's there and well-established and you have no issues, it's probably not worth worrying about.
[19:25:17] <The_Blode> But I can talk to #jquery for that.
[19:25:29] <__adrian> just try it
[19:25:40] <__adrian> i would not expect any problems just passing the input name
[19:25:45] <The_Blode> Got it thanks guys for the feedback. Personally, I'm using Jquery in my personal projects but wanting to move away from it as I hear it's dying / dead.
[19:25:55] <__adrian> the [] syntax is well established
[19:26:22] <da_wunder> and widely used, specially in use cases like this
[19:26:24] <biberu> wouldn't even use js in personal projects ;)
[19:26:45] <The_Blode> No JS? How do webpages come alive?
[19:26:55] <biberu> i write in other languages that compile to js
[19:27:07] <da_wunder> typescript!
[19:29:16] <Nekomander> Whatever you do, it's a good habit to get into using JS modules, instead of relying on a bunch of global variables.

[20:45:30] <Deuchnord> Hello there, I'm writing a PHP script that connects to an IRC channel and sends messages. To connect the IRC server, I use the socket_connect() function, but it looks like the connection is stuck if I use the secure (SSL) port. If I use the unsecure one, the script works like a charm, so I guess I have an SSL support issue with the socket_*() functions. Any idea how I can fix this? Should I use another way to connect the server?
[20:47:18] *** Joins: aruns (~aruns@94.8.77.13)
[20:48:16] <Nekomander> Deuchnord, you need to install the trusted root certification authorities list.
[20:49:02] <da_wunder> could be certificate error
[20:49:14] <Deuchnord> Seems legit, indeed, how can I do this? I have no experience with this kind of this, Nekomander
[20:49:29] <Nekomander> Some IRC servers do not have certificates signed by a trusted authority. For example, Let's Encrypt, verisign, digicert, symantec, and etc.
[20:49:46] <Deuchnord> da_wunder, I don't think so, the IRC server I'm talking about is Twitch's one :D
[20:50:35] <da_wunder> Deuchnord: it might still be an certificate problem, your server where you run that script has not accepted that certificate
[20:50:45] <Nekomander> Deuchnord, use your package manager if you're on Linux. Ask it to install ca-certificates
[20:50:59] <da_wunder> usually that happens on the _first_ time accessing some new site - if I remember that correctly
[20:51:16] <aruns> Hi, if I have https://pastebin.com/U26NYtRd for e.g., what is the fastest way to compute a diff of the two arrays, using just the title column?
[20:51:39] <aruns> I am using PHP 7.4
[20:51:58] <Nekomander> It's generally a horrible idea to ask PHP to use ignore/disable cert verification.
[20:52:21] <Nekomander> (Since it defeats the whole point of using TLS in the first place.)
[20:52:36] <Deuchnord> Nekomander, it is already installed on my side (Arch Linux)
[20:52:56] <Nekomander> Deuchnord, test it with freenode.
[20:53:06] <Nekomander> No not freenode. I meant Libera.
[20:53:09] <Deuchnord> I'll do this :)
[20:55:01] <aruns> Maybe I can use something like array_column
[20:55:57] <Nekomander> Libera would use Letsencrypt. :3
[21:00:26] <Nekomander> arash, array_diff_assoc($array1[0], $array2[0]); <-- and then iterate the key (e.g. looping through [0], [1], [2] and so on)

[21:17:07] <Deuchnord> Nekomander, I confirm I have the same issue with Libera.Chat: if I try to connect through unsecured port 6667 it works, but if I try to connec through any secured port, it fails connecting and I get a "Warning: socket_read(): unable to read from socket [104]: Connection reset by peer"
[21:17:52] <Nekomander> Deuchnord, you will also need to change the option for socket_read() to include TLS, if you hadn't already done so.
[21:20:02] <Deuchnord> oh, that's a new one, how do I do it? Can't find it on the doc :o
[21:21:27] <Nekomander> Also, you need openssl php extension installed, and also, enabled.

[21:23:47] <Nekomander> Deuchnord, https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration56.openssl.php#migration56.openssl.crypto-method I would start with a test script.
[21:24:08] <Nekomander> Test on google first.
[21:24:49] <Sammitch> some older protocols like IRC also might not start a TLS session until AFTER some protocol negotiation
[21:27:28] <Deuchnord> Looks like file_get_contents('https://google.com') works without any issue
[21:27:54] <Deuchnord> Sammitch, does it mean I need to make this negociation by myself ?
[21:29:01] <Sammitch> it means you should read the relevant protocol specs and/or an existing implementation that handles IRC with TLS
[21:29:23] <Deuchnord> hm I see…
[21:29:57] <da_wunder> or search if there is irc client that already do that and just use it
[21:31:24] <Sammitch> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7194#section-2.1 so nevermind what I said, but also if you want to write an IRC client you should probably read some RFCs anyway
[21:33:12] <Deuchnord> Honnestly, I'm starting to think that I might actually have started with the wrong technos to do what I'm trying to achieve (connect to an IRC channel and send a single PRIVMSG). PHP might be a little to much low-level for that, and I know that Python can handle the TSL connections natively (nothing to do manually). Thank you anyway for your help :)
[21:33:41] <Sammitch> lol six of one, half-dozen of the other
[21:34:00] <Nekomander> Deuchnord, yet another IRC bot?
[21:34:09] <Nekomander> Happy coding though. :)
[21:34:21] <Nekomander> I made mines in python.
[21:34:53] <Sammitch> I forget which language I used for mine, but it was immediately banned in the channel I wanted to use it in T_T
[21:35:23] <Deuchnord> Nope, Nekomander, something much more custom in my case, this is why I don't use an already made bot ^^
[21:35:34] <Nekomander> LOL.
[21:36:41] <Nekomander> Discord to IRC bridge? - My bot was a game bot, with psuedo AI responses. Unique irc games.
