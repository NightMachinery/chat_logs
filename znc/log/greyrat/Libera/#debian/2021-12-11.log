You could list packages with 'nautilus' in the name to see extensions for it with "apt list ~nnautilus" (and read about each package with "apt show packagename"), one of those packages might add what you want.

Debian 4.19.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.208-1 (2021-09-29) x86_64 GNU/Linux - a couple of weeks ago, when I started virtualbox, host automatically recognizes the new interfaces (vboxnet0) and automatically connects. Now I cant connect anymore to vboxnet0. Under networkmanager it is unmanaged, but I removed from interfaces and choose the managed=true too for NM, but nothing..I still can connect to vboxnet0

[21:14:12] <areyouloco> hi I have broken the linuxmint installation during the full-upgrade beyond repair. now i want to install debian-testing+non-free on it
[21:14:18] <areyouloco> so the question is
[21:14:53] <areyouloco> if I choose in debian installer to not to format the / partition will it keep the data in /home/someuser/Desktop/somedir
[21:15:43] <areyouloco> on mint everything was on / with extra swap nothing else
[21:16:06] <areyouloco> I have no space to backup the data so I ask for confirmation
[21:16:15] <areyouloco> and I have to fix it untill tommorow
[21:16:28] <areyouloco> and live system for some reason doesnt work
[21:16:44] <areyouloco> so i only have debian-installer rescue console
[21:16:49] <darsie> You are loco.
[21:16:56] <darsie> ;)
[21:17:31] <areyouloco> its AreYouLoco? ( questionmark included)
[21:17:47] <darsie> Why not stable? It's not that old.
[21:18:02] <areyouloco> i had testing image downloaded already
[21:18:53] <areyouloco> it doesnt matter the release
[21:19:01] <randall> !mint
[21:19:01] <dpkg> Linux Mint is not Debian and is not supported in #debian.  Please use their forums at http://forums.linuxmint.com/ or join #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org for support.  Linux Mint is variously based on <Ubuntu> with a "Linux Mint Debian Edition" (LMDE) also available.  See also <based on debian>, <mintppc>.
[21:19:02] <areyouloco> it has to boot at least for tomorrow
[21:19:09] <randall> areyouloco: You might want to ask in their channel. ^^^
[21:19:19] <xx> randall: they want to install debian over mint
[21:19:20] <areyouloco> randall: i am not asking about mint
[21:19:37] <areyouloco> i am asking about debian installer mechanism

[21:20:46] <randall> areyouloco: While it's possible, I _don't_ recommend installing over your current installation without backups.
[21:21:12] <randall> areyouloco: Meaning: Buy a backup HDD or borrow one from a friend, back the data up, and install Debian then.
[21:21:22] <darsie> areyouloco: Do you need xorg? With high performance graphics driver?
[21:21:28] <randall> !testing installer
[21:21:28] <dpkg> Repeat after me: the testing installer is for testing the <installer>, not for installing <testing>.  To install testing, do a minimal installation using the <stable> installer and ask me about <stable->testing>.  Installer bugs should be filed against the debian-installer pseudopackage.  https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/
[21:22:24] <randall> areyouloco: If you decide to install over without backups (I cannot stress enough how I recommend against it), you can delete everything there except for /home, and then choose "no" to formatting it in the installer.
[21:22:27] <darsie> areyouloco: How about compressing your home?
[21:22:57] <darsie> Won't help if the bulk is image/video.
[21:23:04] <randall> areyouloco: You should however use the stable installer, and upgrade to testing instead. Also, testing is a moving target and may break any time, so you're willingly beta-testing the 5-day old packages being uploaded.

[21:28:39] <randall> areyouloco: Yes, that's not a problem. But again: If you screw something up during installation, your data is gone. So I'd rather wait a couple of days if that allows you to back up your data before installation.

[21:33:00] <areyouloco> thats what I want to do

[22:45:35] <jimm> meanwhile, it says to set some env vars... I'd set these on the pi?

[22:48:32] <jimm> not sure what to do with that in terms of these setup vars
[22:50:22] <areyouloco> you could setup env vars in /etc/profile
[22:50:51] <jimm> yeah, true
[22:51:08] <jimm> they're just used to see which image to get

[23:05:18] <randall> jimm: Technically you could just fill in those values yourself, but I guess it'll just save some typing. And no, you shouldn't set them in /etc/profile, as you only need them once.

[23:29:13] <randall> jimm: They are base images, that are kind of installed. The packages are not configured, and this is done on the first boot. This is done so that e.g. ssh keys are generated and are not identical on all copies of the image.
