[11:47:27] <ProfSimm> Two contexts that resonate unexpectedly:  	1. You're told a story in one context, but it's revealed you're in another. 	2. You're watching someone confuse one context for another. 	3. You're watching two contexts that shouldn't be related keep resonating unexpectedly. You're watching someone try to achieve action in one context and produce a completely different and dissonant (to their goals) context.

[14:40:26] <kmh> ProfSimm,  say what?
[14:40:50] <ProfSimm> kmh: some new age crap on youtube
[14:41:20] <kmh> sounds like a scene from preacher
[14:41:47] <kmh> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preacher_(Fernsehserie)
[14:41:47] <ro-bot-o> [url] Preacher (Fernsehserie) – Wikipedia | de.wikipedia.org
[14:42:17] <Lumine> ProfSimm: what shocks me is that they even had the energy to make such a video
[14:42:28] <ProfSimm> But honestly why would you make a near-death-experience story where you meet HITLER
[14:42:56] <ProfSimm> It literally makes it seem like you were confused and making stories in your head from all the hitler-in-hell memes you've heard in your life
[14:43:38] <ProfSimm> The idea Hitler is like some kind of top hell celebrity is so hilariously human
[14:47:21] <ProfSimm> Like
[14:47:22] <amigojapan> ProfSimm: ndes could be real hallucinations. Maybe he saw that cause that is what he expected
[14:47:38] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: this is another theme, you see what you expect
[14:48:01] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: some say it's intentional, the entities show us familiar faces because reality is too incomprehensible.
[14:48:10] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: Jesus, God, dead relatives
[14:48:14] <ProfSimm> But...
[14:48:22] <ProfSimm> why the hell would an entity show up as HITLER
[14:48:24] <ProfSimm> :D
[14:48:29] <ProfSimm> It's f*** hilarious
[14:50:48] <amigojapan> ProfSimm: I can see it happening in one of my dreams, dreams are pretty crazy
[14:55:42] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: well the point is this is given to us not as a dream, but as reality
[14:56:02] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: because why would I care someone dreamed of Hitler while unconscious
[14:56:21] <ProfSimm> Semi conscious rather
[14:57:06] <amigojapan> ProfSimm: but it is likely a hallucination which is closer to a dream
[14:57:48] <amigojapan> It may not be someone just making up a story
[14:58:26] <amigojapan> Often people think hallucinations are real
[15:02:24] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: sure, but you know when you wake up, first thing you realize is "oh, I didn't actually meet Hitler"
[15:02:47] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: so didn't this person think through the likelyhood he spoke to Hitler
[15:04:47] <amigojapan> ProfSimm: you would be surprised the number of people I see on IRC that claim "dreams are real and they happen in other dimensions"
[15:08:52] <amigojapan> Or in the spiritual realm
[15:08:55] <mrig> ProfSimm I've been pondering your enquiry into humour from this morning over in programming thought that here might be a better place to respond, morning here anyhow. The conclusion that I've come to is that laughter is required for the orbit of mercury to remain eccentric, without it the entire solar system would fall into a state of perpetual dogma; Irony is the hand that rules over those who would otherwise, all to readily, resort to the iron fist. My
[15:08:55] <mrig> question to you, if you will humour me that this be the case, would be this; What is it that is evolving in this scenario and why does it need to be dependant upon biological evolution, could biology be simply the host?
[15:09:36] <mrig> an emergent property not evolutionary.
[15:10:00] <ProfSimm> mrig you brought me high there and slammed me into the ground, cruel
[15:10:50] <mrig> heh, why do you say that, there was no malice nor competition in my thought?
[15:11:13] <ProfSimm> mrig: well either this, or I don't understand what the orbit of Mercury has with laughter
[15:11:52] <mrig> ah, I am hinting at the nature of predictability.
[15:12:23] <ProfSimm> mrig: as for what is evolving, yes, eventually the thing that's evolving becomes the substrate for higher evolution. Like us exchanging/evolving ideas in this medium of hybrid meat/electronic network
[15:12:25] <mrig> Giving it a nudge and a wink, if you see what I mean.
[15:12:49] <ProfSimm> I'm referring to Internet and humans
[15:13:11] <mrig> do the patterns that emerge from sound waves that are confined or limited, evolve?
[15:13:29] <mrig> why would material evolution need to be a factor at all?
[15:13:41] <ProfSimm> Evolution is an emergent process of a pattern that can persist, but also change adaptively to survive.
[15:13:50] <ProfSimm> It can be many things.
[15:13:55] <ProfSimm> Including as I said, ideas
[15:14:04] <ProfSimm> Ideas are not only not matter, not even sound.
[15:14:11] <ProfSimm> They're kinda abstract, but they evolve
[15:14:36] <ProfSimm> mrig: matter is just waves, anyway
[15:14:40] <ProfSimm> Everything's waves
[15:14:45] <mrig> Sure yes, but not nessearly the leading element, if my point.
[15:15:20] <mrig> sorry for the spelling there, this spell check is coded by an idiot and I didn't want to go google it and have no dictionary to hand. :|
[15:15:34] * mrig waves at ProfSimm :)
[15:16:10] <ProfSimm> mrig: keep waving until your waving gains consciousness
[15:16:13] <ProfSimm> :D
[15:17:25] * mrig generates a vortex in his living room ...
[15:18:02] <mrig> Dang, should probably have opened a window first :D

[15:43:34] <amigojapan> That's possible mrig
[15:43:42] <mrig> just a thought.
[15:44:09] <amigojapan> I personally like tragedies better than comedies, but I can't explain why
[15:44:28] <amigojapan> Maybe more adrenaline
[15:45:11] <amigojapan> I feel happy after watching a tragedy
[15:46:26] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: a bad comedy is flat, nothing matters, it's all for a joke. Like in Home Alone instead of watching people with cracked skulls bleeding and suffering in agony, it's all played for laughs. Nothing matters in bad comedies.
[15:46:37] <amigojapan> Is there something wrong with me? Maybe I should ask a shrink
[15:46:44] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: and good comedies are never pure comedies.
[15:46:47] <ProfSimm> Hence...
[15:47:10] <mrig> perhaps there were lots of happy stories too but the history books have been compiled by miserable scholars in ivory towers, all of who's pier grope are cynically depressed?

[15:47:36] <ProfSimm> That said Looney Tunes was hilarious
[15:47:44] <mrig> cynical depression is a terrible affliction for a culture to catch.
[15:48:26] <amigojapan> Aidhan: I welcome any thoughts
[15:48:38] <mrig> Aidhan, if you need to ask, would not your contribution be somewhat biased?
[15:49:18] <mrig> Throw in a stone or two and see how the ripples play upon the surface of our minds.
[15:50:19] <amigojapan> mrig: I thought you said "clinical depression" I will Google cynical depression

[15:51:18] <mrig> amigojapan it was a play on words, if you put a good depression into a clinic, you will ruin its vintage; Far better to channel it into something creative.
[15:51:42] <mrig> No mean feat, of that I am very aware.

[15:52:55] <mrig> amigojapan I was indeed referring to depression, or melancholy in the light of discussion upon Greek tragedy.
[15:53:12] <amigojapan> mrig: I think I avoid watching tragedies when I feel depressed
[15:53:22] <mrig> I'm not sure that cynical depression will get many hits on google :D
[15:53:39] <mrig> cyclical will for sure.
[15:53:42] <amigojapan> It does not :)
[15:54:26] <amigojapan> mrig: also I prefer my tragedies to be fiction
[15:55:05] <mrig> I like positive heart jerker's more than tragedies.
[15:55:18] <mrig> Not easy to find good ones though.

[15:55:59] <mrig> such a softy, am regularly in tears in front of a web-stream :D
[15:58:21] <amigojapan> mrig: and when I feel depressed I seek out humour to cheer me up
[15:59:00] <mrig> Humour is a nice lining to depressions cloud, if you can grab it.
[15:59:04] <mrig> nice
[16:00:17] <mrig> The light in or about the clouds of a storm is always so very dramatic, enough so to fill an amphitheatre, of that I am certain!
[16:03:55] <amigojapan> mrig: I wish I could go to an amphitheatre at least once
[16:04:06] <amigojapan> Not a medical one
[16:04:46] <mrig> Amazing that these buildings were constructed for acoustics all that time ago.
[16:05:25] <amigojapan> mrig: this culture you are criticizing, the ancient Greeks is the cradle of all Western civilization
[16:05:42] <mrig> I am waiting with somewhat baited breath to see how the culture will evolve in the future, of this current time.
[16:05:50] <mrig> no its not.
[16:06:02] <amigojapan> No?
[16:06:08] <mrig> And I am not criticising it either.
[16:06:14] <mrig> I am poking fun at it.
[16:06:15] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[16:06:20] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[16:06:50] <mrig> and above all at historians and those who believe somewhat dogmatically that it is the cradle of all western civilisation.
[16:08:03] <mrig> I know what I don't know :)
[16:08:06] <amigojapan> Alright. I know ancient historians and modern historians are almost completely different
[16:09:08] <mrig> as ephemeral as a thought of the future.
[16:10:47] <amigojapan> I wonder when the words "historian" was coined
[16:10:53] <mrig> I do attribute great importance of respecting our ancestors, but this is not a proof or logic based thing.
[16:11:29] <amigojapan> mrig: we got part of our ancestors in our blood
[16:11:34] <mrig> Because ephemeral and proof are not really all that comfy.
[16:12:12] <mrig> Yes I agree, often ask what is the difference between the notion of DNA and a tribes mans notion of an ancestor.
[16:12:52] <mrig> pretty much completely interchangeable concepts in many contexts.
[16:13:38] <mrig> This is way way better a thought proposition when we consider the neuro epigenome in the mix too, not only the genome.
[16:14:23] <mrig> More obvious to those with more simple lives, perhaps, such a notion?
[16:14:45] <amigojapan> mrig: I find a little peace in the thought that in a way my grandparents and parents are not completely gone
[16:15:36] <mrig> Why would you assume that you are here for peace? Perhaps you are supposed to appease them not yourself?
[16:16:04] <mrig> just a thought, nothing intended by that.
[16:16:12] <amigojapan> I meant peace of mind
[16:16:46] <mrig> How is there any difference?
[16:17:04] <amigojapan> Not only do I have part of their DNA. I also remember them will and I often dream of them
[16:17:18] <mrig> If you DNA wants it, pretty sure that it can perturb your mind.
[16:17:30] <amigojapan> mrig: I don't understand your point
[16:17:43] <mrig> Yes, this is the neurological aspect of this, I agree with you there.
[16:17:55] <amigojapan> Ok
[16:18:06] <mrig> Oh I situate the 'mind' as being the part of the self that links the thought process to the body.
[16:18:21] <mrig> so it is quite heavily connected to the gut and the heart.
[16:19:00] <mrig> I am aware that the english translation of mind is often very heavily correlated with the brain, sorry for any confusion.

[16:31:34] <amigojapan> mrig: ah good luck man
[16:31:38] <Irishmanluke> mrig: are you using a backend framework to build it?
[16:31:48] <mrig> thank you amigojapan :)
[16:32:01] <amigojapan> :)
[16:32:17] <mrig> Irishmanluke no, going for golang with pretty much no dependencies at all.
[16:33:45] <mrig> am grappling making a nice interface of my own for CRUD, with full REST functionality; The thought being that once nailed there would be a really low upkeep overhead.
[16:34:26] <Irishmanluke> you must be using a framework though unless youre literally building a web server and just parsing the http requests directly
[16:35:22] <amigojapan> A framework is a large layer of abstraction.
[16:35:31] <mrig> well golang has a server in its standard lib.
[16:36:00] <mrig> so if you learn the protocol well it is pretty much like playing with a lego set.
[16:36:33] <mrig> rather than playmobil
[16:37:01] <mrig> if you will excuse my childish analogies :)
[16:37:41] <amigojapan> You are better off learning how to do things without a framework before you use one, so you know how things work
[16:38:57] <mrig> Yes I'm of a similar mindset, really do need to as well, else I can't visualise what I'm trying to do :|
[16:39:12] <amigojapan> Yup

[16:57:22] <mrig> Irishmanluke a server is like 10 lines of code.

[16:57:45] <mrig> else 5
[16:57:50] <Irishmanluke> ok
[16:58:26] <mrig> On free will, I'd go with not having any more than a third :)
[16:58:35] <mrig> How about yourself?
[16:58:43] <Irishmanluke> well thats something
[16:59:05] <mrig> What is the thing about that thought?
[16:59:22] <mrig> I am intrigued :)
[17:00:12] <Irishmanluke> I guess Im more of a compatableist but when it comes to so called libertarian free will I can firmly say it doesnt exist a priori
[17:00:18] <mrig> If it is something, then it must be something to some observer: I would love to know who that observer is in this context?
[17:00:47] <mrig> I dont really understand what libertarian means.
[17:01:25] <mrig> are they those fools who spend their entire lives slaves to desire?
[17:01:31] <Irishmanluke> in this context it just means completely unconstrained from any deterministic or even probabilistic logic
[17:01:40] <mrig> ah ok.
[17:02:04] <Irishmanluke> free will as a force distinct from any other natural laws
[17:02:46] <mrig> I think that all things are interrelated and as such we are permanently in a sort of soup; Though our own character does effect how it is that the viscosity of that soup effects our freedome.
[17:03:10] <mrig> but that character is also innate to a certain degree.
[17:03:20] <mrig> as such some have more freedom than others.
[17:04:14] <mrig> but who it is that is free and how is bound up in sticky soup; Is really not an easy question to answer, personally I'd go with this changes over time.
[17:04:36] <mrig> sorry, s/how is bound/who is bound/
[17:05:08] <Irishmanluke> It sounds like youre identifying the ordinary sense of the word agency, unless Im misunderstanding
[17:05:13] <mrig> and location not only time, but that is a given if we have accepted space time as a real phenomenon.
[17:05:22] <absentia> so
[17:05:25] <absentia> relations exist between objects
[17:05:37] <mrig> events too, not only objects.
[17:06:36] <mrig> Irishmanluke I think viscosity is more appropriate.
[17:06:50] <mrig> agency is not really that fitting here.
[17:07:16] <mrig> individuals are unpredictable, peoples are not.
[17:07:36] *** Joins: emmeka (~emmeka@162-251-198-66.dynamic.parolink.net)
[17:08:50] <Irishmanluke> so on the question of whether it is possible for an individual to make a decision thats not fully determined in advanced by natural laws, you would say what
[17:09:11] <mrig> would a pollen seed that is darting about in Brownian motion, think that it is a busy bee doing so very much, if it were concious?
[17:09:55] <mrig> Is that which makes germination happen in a receiving plant a concious act upon some level?
[17:10:29] <Irishmanluke> define conscious act
[17:10:34] <mrig> I would say that there is no such thing as an individual, the old classic no man is an island.
[17:10:49] <mrig> oh that is easy, a weighted event.
[17:11:31] <mrig> now define probability and randomness in a satisfactory way?
[17:11:49] <mrig> In such a way that includes limits.
[17:12:25] <Irishmanluke> my question doesnt hinge on the concept of an individual, replace individual with human being if you want
[17:12:30] <mrig> Else I will call in such a devise as being equivalent to the use of a god.
[17:12:50] <Irishmanluke> struggling to type on my phones soft keyboard
[17:13:14] <mrig> ouch yes, that is a bit of a fiddle!
[17:14:29] * mrig conjurers up an image of a large Irish hand upon the neck of a very small fiddle.
[17:15:35] <Irishmanluke> randomness is that which is not deterministic
[17:15:56] <absentia> Irishmanluke: your question seems to presuppose that things are fully determined by natural laws
[17:16:20] <Irishmanluke> does it?
[17:16:28] <absentia> so on the question of whether it is possible for an individual to make a decision thats not fully determined in advanced by
[17:16:30] <absentia> natural laws, you would say what
[17:16:46] <absentia> this seems equivalent to the claim, "all decisions are fully determined by natural laws"
[17:16:50] <Irishmanluke> I remember the phrasing
[17:17:24] <Irishmanluke> someone could answer no to the question
[17:17:36] <absentia> it's strange to pose the question like that is what i'm saying
[17:17:55] <Irishmanluke> Im missing the strangeness
[17:17:59] <absentia> "is it possible to make a decision not fully determined"
[17:18:17] <mrig> It is similar to the thought that I had, when I asked, who is the observer in this context.
[17:18:23] <absentia> like what does determination mean in that phrase
[17:18:41] <absentia> and yes, I should add the rest of that phrase - determined by natural laws
[17:18:53] <Irishmanluke> It means given some initial condition there can only be one response
[17:19:03] <absentia> Irishmanluke: then what do you mean by a decision
[17:19:26] <Irishmanluke> the ordinary sense of decision
[17:19:40] <absentia> ordinary senses prove not to hold up that well in philosophyu
[17:19:45] <Irishmanluke> a plan of action
[17:20:14] <absentia> what good is planning if the future is already predetermined
[17:20:42] <Irishmanluke> the planning process takes place within that determination
[17:20:55] <absentia> so the act of planning itself is deterministic?
[17:21:09] <Irishmanluke> I would say so
[17:21:51] <mrig> Irishmanluke you can have a predetermined outcome that has many possible outcomes.
[17:21:52] <absentia> this seems to be equivalent to either a compatibilist or a hard deterministic position
[17:22:05] <absentia> but
[17:22:12] <absentia> i still have qualms with the terminology
[17:22:20] <Irishmanluke> Think of Tesla autopilot, it makes sense to think of this system as doing planning although clearly its just csrrying out its programming deterministically
[17:22:23] <absentia> "planning" is used in a sense that implies agency
[17:22:30] <absentia> but if the act of planning is deterministic
[17:22:32] <absentia> there is no agency
[17:22:36] <mrig> If you cant, your language is fundamentally flawed.
[17:22:43] <absentia> the entire sequence of events across all of time has already been written
[17:22:57] <Irishmanluke> there is agency in the normal sense of the word I would claim
[17:23:01] <mrig> and arguably also your philosophical foundation.
[17:23:45] <absentia> what's the difference between planning and prophecy
[17:23:54] <absentia> seeing into the future
[17:24:37] <absentia> is Tesla autopilot actually planning?
[17:24:45] <absentia> or is it just fast-forwarding into the future a little bit
[17:25:09] <Irishmanluke> well necessarily you're trying to predict the future as you plan but also effect it
[17:25:19] <Irishmanluke> in general you do so imperfectly though
[17:25:35] *** Joins: Jong (~Jong@2620:10d:c090:400::5:8039)
[17:25:59] <absentia> how does one affect the future in a deterministic universe
[17:26:09] <Irishmanluke> deterministically
[17:26:43] <Jong> deterministically
[17:27:29] <absentia> i entered this discussion not believing in free will
[17:27:31] <Irishmanluke> Suppose I wake up, notice that I'm hungry, decide to go to WaWa to get breakfast sandwhich, go to wawa to get a breakfast sandwhich, eat it, now I'm not hungry anymore.  Clearly there's some sense of agency and planning here but it could also be that due to the way that my brain happens to work, there could not have been any alternative universe in which the events didn't unfold in that
[17:27:33] <Jong> iI was deterministically hardwired to answer deterministically after seeing Irishmanluke's answer of deterministically
[17:27:36] <absentia> and i still have not changed my position
[17:27:37] <Irishmanluke> particular way
[17:28:11] <absentia> Irishmanluke: but did you really "decide" to go to wawa
[17:28:20] <absentia> or were you just compelled by the forces of deterministic causation
[17:28:31] <Irishmanluke> well clearly in the normal sense of the word yes, it hinges on how you choose to define decide
[17:28:33] <Jong> absentia everything you've said, did you have a choice in saying it, or were you deterministically driven to say it?
[17:28:43] <absentia> Jong: deterministic
[17:29:00] <absentia> it's the output of a maddeningly complicated deterministic process
[17:29:08] <absentia> i don't have the expertise to bring quantum into this
[17:29:12] <Irishmanluke> absentia: I'm a compatabilist
[17:29:21] <absentia> Irishmanluke: i can jive with compatibilism
[17:29:29] <Jong> it's not really known if the universe is fully deterministic
[17:29:59] <absentia> I think part of what I'm trying to get at here with these pedantics is I don't even know what "decision" or "choice" means in these kinds of discussions
[17:30:04] <Jong> There are known undeterministic things
[17:30:18] <Irishmanluke> I should also say I've been using determinism as kind of a facade, I don't necessarily believe the universe is deterministic, it could be probabilistic, but nothing in my argumnent really hings on whether or not it is deterministic or probabilistic
[17:30:56] <Irishmanluke> randomness doesn't equal libertarian free will
[17:30:59] <Irishmanluke> and can't really
[17:31:12] <absentia> randomness kind of implies the absence of choice
[17:31:12] <Irishmanluke> I should say randomness can't account for libertarian free will
[17:31:22] <Irishmanluke> absentia: yes I agree
[17:31:31] <absentia> but again
[17:31:34] <absentia> what the fuck is choice
[17:31:45] <absentia> this i think is the hardest thing to think about
[17:31:47] <Irishmanluke> well if there is such a thing as choice at all clearly it doesn't lie in randomness
[17:31:53] <absentia> why not
[17:32:05] <mrig> absentia I think that prediction is a more logical term than profit; a prescription is a written statement that depends upon some prior examination, and a prediction is a statement that depend upon some prior examination. That said, the predictions of someone like Elon Musk when casing phrases into the universe upon a platform such as twitter, likely do effect his profits.

[17:32:38] <Irishmanluke> because choice implies an exertion of one's self, if an event is random, the particular self necessarily doesn't factor into it
[17:32:39] <absentia> call me the prophet of profit
[17:32:48] <mrig> What it is that is examined and by whom, is by far the more interesting facet of such an event.
[17:32:53] <Irishmanluke> s/exertion/assertion
[17:32:53] <ro-bot-o> Irishmanluke meant to say: because choice implies an assertion of one's self, if an event is random, the particular self necessarily doesn't factor into it
[17:33:14] <mrig> but an event it is, and effects they do have.
[17:33:53] <mrig> not with out weight though, obviously.
[17:34:00] <absentia> iow future events depend on past causes in a way randomness does not
[17:34:41] <mrig> I personally equate the use of randomness in any argument as calling upon a god.
[17:34:45] <mrig> same thing.
[17:34:51] <inhahe_> The problem with our conception of randomness is that we assume it's meaningless, and thus can't account for free will. But whatever's behind randomness could be meaningful (magical, spiritual, whatever is necessary for true free will) yet non-mechanistic. Of course a non-mechanistic source of events would be unamenable to physical modeling and would probably appear to us exactly as
[17:34:52] <inhahe_> "absolute randomness."
[17:35:08] <absentia> if "one's self" here is "any deterministic system" then I agree
[17:35:28] <absentia> any deterministic system necessarily asserts itself into the future by having some causal impact on it
[17:35:47] <absentia> if an event is random (which almost by definition means it's independent of prior "causes")
[17:35:51] <absentia> then the system can't have chosen it
[17:36:09] <mrig> That is not to say that it is not useful to do so though, by any means.
[17:36:23] <absentia> but maybe by equating "one's self" with "any deterministic system" this is begging the question
[17:37:01] <absentia> inhahe_: there are multiple senses of the word random which is the problem
[17:37:19] <Irishmanluke> I'm not sure that we can really know for sure that any event is truly random but assuming that an event is truly random then it is necessarily detached from any prior context and therefore can't possibly be meaningful
[17:37:27] <absentia> in one sense you have "random" white noise which is completely devoid of informational content
[17:37:31] <absentia> which is a statistical sense
[17:37:45] <absentia> in a colloquial sense you have "random" as in "independent of prior states/causes"
[17:37:49] <inhahe_> absentia: the two common senses seem to be 1) we can't predict it, presumably because we don't konw all the variables or have a sufficient physical theory, and 2) it's "absolutely random" and meaningless. i'm proposing something else.
[17:37:52] <absentia> or "without rationale"
[17:38:43] <absentia> so meaningful but non-mechanistic randomness
[17:39:02] <absentia> so sense 2), or the "white noise" sense is out
[17:39:09] <Irishmanluke> inhahe_: I think a third sends is impossible
[17:39:16] <Irishmanluke> s/sends/sense
[17:39:16] <ro-bot-o> Irishmanluke meant to say: inhahe_: I think a third sense is impossible
[17:39:23] <absentia> I proposed a third sense
[17:39:29] <absentia> without rationale
[17:39:50] <Irishmanluke> as in "random acts of violence"
[17:39:56] <absentia> people should be able to explain their choices and thinking
[17:39:57] <absentia> yes
[17:40:00] <absentia> motives, expected outcomes, etc
[17:40:06] <inhahe_> Irishmanluke: i think in our modern age we're trained to think of the world totally mechanistically, so it's hard for us to wrap our head around a meaningful but non-mechanistic source
[17:40:11] <Crux> Free will is metavolition.
[17:40:16] <Irishmanluke> ok sure thats a legitimate definition but I'm saying what inahe_ is proposing is impossible
[17:40:23] <Irishmanluke> inhahe_
[17:40:55] <Crux> Causation is probablistic.
[17:41:04] <absentia> i struggle to think of any non-mechanistic system that is still capable of emitting information
[17:41:12] <absentia> it would be like seeing faces on the moon
[17:41:23] <Irishmanluke> inhahe_: Could be but my argument is that meaning implies that there's some rationale for the event which implies it must have some relation to the context around it
[17:41:25] <absentia> or hearing aliens in radio chatter
[17:41:57] <absentia> like if it's non-mechanistic
[17:42:03] <absentia> that almost sounds like it has no relation to anything whatsoever
[17:42:12] <absentia> in which case what useful thing is there to say about it
[17:42:16] <Irishmanluke> yes I think absentia are making the same argument
[17:42:23] <absentia> Irishmanluke: I think so
[17:43:03] <inhahe_> Irishmanluke: consciousness could non-mechanistically (thus neither deterministically nor meaninglessly randomly, but with actual free will) take into account contextual things in making a decision (or in creative expression), thus providing a rationale or relation
[17:43:22] <absentia> what's the difference between something mechanical and non-mechanical
[17:46:09] <Irishmanluke> one possibility strikes me, which is that it is possible at least logically that there are events which are a result of something like a computational process but for which the process itself has no physical correlates, that would be something that might be able to be considered non-mechanistic
[17:47:08] <Irishmanluke> now I don't think that's actually likely but throwing it out there anyway
[17:47:09] <absentia> i would still say virtual machines are mechanistic
[17:47:24] <Irishmanluke> virtual machines have physical correlates though
[17:47:26] <absentia> physical embodiment is not a prerequisite for mechanism
[17:47:35] <absentia> Irishmanluke: has someone built a physical JVM
[17:47:37] <absentia> CPU
[17:47:50] <absentia> or a WASM CPU
[17:47:52] <Irishmanluke> they have particular physical instantiations
[17:48:12] <absentia> ok so
[17:48:14] <absentia> an oracle
[17:48:20] <absentia> that is maybe the only example I can think of
[17:48:25] <absentia> and it's almost by definition
[17:48:31] <absentia> an oracle provides you information, "somehow"
[17:48:38] <absentia> and the somehow is completely out of the picture - non-mechanistic
[17:48:50] <absentia> but this almost just seems to sweep the problem under the rug and into a black box
[17:49:12] <absentia> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine
[17:49:12] <ro-bot-o> [url] Oracle machine - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[17:49:28] <Irishmanluke> an oracle is a good example I think
[17:49:57] <absentia> unfortunately oracles don't exist
[17:50:02] <absentia> outside of as an academic thought exercise
[17:50:07] <Irishmanluke> we don't know that for certain
[17:50:56] <Irishmanluke> If we assume that the universe is deterministic then the oracles behavior would necessarily also be deterministic
[17:51:04] <absentia> if an oracle existed
[17:51:06] <absentia> we could solve the halting problem
[17:51:08] <Irishmanluke> but it certainly intuitvely seems to also meet the definition of nonmechanistic
[17:51:25] <Irishmanluke> absentia: non-computationally though
[17:51:41] <Irishmanluke> absentia: it doesn't contradict Turing
[17:52:37] <absentia> this problem makes my brain hurt
[17:52:45] <mrig> absentia does this oracle understand what the five major elements are or not?
[17:52:53] <mrig> plato did not, clearly.
[17:53:18] * absentia rotates widdershins and banishes earth in the east
[17:54:31] <mrig> now if we ponder how these elements resemble the abstract mathematical devices that are used in modern statistical predictive techniques, why would oracles not exist?
[17:54:47] <mrig> seems like quite a presumption that you make.
[17:54:58] <mrig> to me anyhow.
