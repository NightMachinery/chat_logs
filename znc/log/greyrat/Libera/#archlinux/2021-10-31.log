[00:04:57] <evilop> in the first place
[00:05:27] <evilop> is the server directly on the public network?
[00:06:04] <evilop> or are you using hostname and it happen to resolve to a public ip?
[00:09:04] <johndvd> i have a nas (local server) and internet connection through one router. i count traffic on internet-nic, and local traffic to/from nas should not be counted (via vnstat)

[00:10:28] <johndvd> i tried change route "default" to mount the nas. but defining seperate routes for local server traffic seems to work
[00:10:39] <evilop> the router shouldn't be sending the traffic to the nas out on the public interface
[00:11:14] <johndvd> yeah, it shouldn't - but it does
[00:12:03] <evilop> you are running vnstat on the router?

[00:14:48] <johndvd> the main PC does have 2 nics, one (the slow one) should be for internet connection, and the fast one should handle local network connections
[00:15:11] <evilop> two nicks but both are connected to the same router?

[03:07:20] <mikebutash> well oddly kde can't control it either via media keys
[03:07:35] <mikebutash> another thing that says something got fubar
[03:07:36] <mcurran> My pulse likes to repeatedly create duplicate and quadruple instances of the simultaneous output device I enabled and also whatever app is utilizing the audio service.  This may just be something I can see from the User menu in gnome-shell (top right corner) that wasn't previously there, but I tried disabling the virtual device, but I like the sound out of it best, rather than the separated ones

[03:08:34] <concrete-houses> I don't go that way
[03:08:42] <mikebutash> it's sound doesn't control the card either
[03:08:49] <susi> maybe just reboot after update
[03:09:03] <mikebutash> something broken at kernel, alsa, or pulse level imho
[03:09:54] <mcurran> gnome is best, except the shit decisions nautilus dev's like to make, and that is a transparent/translucent terminal, which not only looks better, but has purpose when you are looking at the web and typing in the terminal
[03:09:56] <concrete-houses> yeah id say try a reboot

[03:10:27] <mikebutash> sound so far has been the worse since last update
[03:11:07] <mcurran> yeah, i have the first automated dkms rebuild of the nvidia proprietary drivers waiting for me on reboot.  
[03:11:20] <mikebutash> well, why I haven't been too worried about it for weeks, but figured I'd ping a bigger audience, I can't find anyone else seeing it
[03:11:37] <mcurran> i'd say i have a 25% chance of getting to my desktop without issue :)

[05:54:08] <sheep> are there any messages in dmesg relevant to r8118eu?
[05:54:08] <ectospasm> also, do you need a firmware blob for this?
[05:54:26] <sheep> the exact command is probably "modprobe r8188eu"
[05:54:27] <kpcyrd> noahmg123: if the usb stick returns different data then the data that was written to it, badblocks should detect it. that could cause the symptoms you've described.
[05:55:28] <susi> 8188eu-dkms blacklists r8188eu so the correct command might be modprobe 8188eu

[05:56:22] <noahmg123> kpcyrd: Yeah it's running rn. Also, I'm not sure if it's how Nautilus usually does it, but I ejected the device from Nautilus, ran badblocks and got "badblocks: No medium found while trying to determine device size", I unplugged it and plugged it back in, unmounted the one partition, and now badblocks is running

[06:00:07] <kevr> Do you happen to know what the root cause was?
[06:00:21] <kevr> Did it just knock your pacman db or installs out of sync or something?
[06:00:30] <kpcyrd> noahmg123: "No medium found while trying to determine device size" doesn't sound very promising, if you're using a usb hub try connecting directly to the computer, if it's working sometimes it could also be an issue with the usb port (tho less likely)
[06:01:13] <kevr> and, really, the root cause of the crash is what i'm really curious about
[06:01:36] <noahmg123> kpcyrd: to clarify that only happened after I ejected it from Nautilus (so that badblocks wouldn't complain about it being in use)
[06:01:52] <kpcyrd> noahmg123: if badblocks doesn't show any errors you could try just copying the image again, maybe only some writes fail
[06:02:01] * kpcyrd heading out for today, zZz
[06:02:13] <noahmg123> kpcyrd: gn!
[06:02:52] <ectospasm> It can be slow, but you can determine the number of bytes in your image, then dd if=/dev/path/to/usb/device of=some/local/file bs=1 count=<number of bytes in the image>
[06:03:07] <ectospasm> Then compare the sum of the image and the new image you created with dd
[06:03:18] <ectospasm> if they differ, you probably have a bad USB stick

[07:38:32] *** Parts: VMGuy23 (~VMGuy23@user/vmguy23) (Leaving)
[07:39:21] <Scisista> so if you want to generate the UUID and the label of the home, root and swap partition, you have to do all of it inside chroot?
[07:39:46] <sheep> no
[07:39:59] <sheep> are you using a home filesystem that already exists?
[07:40:16] <Scisista> no?
[07:40:19] <Scisista> I think?
[07:40:25] <sheep> you are creating a new home partition?

[07:40:56] *** Joins: slowButPresent (~slowButPr@user/slowbutpresent)
[07:41:06] <sheep> then you should do whatever the install guide says. I think that says you make the partition and filesystem before chroot, mount it at /mnt/home, then chroot
[07:41:17] <sheep> oh, this is an existing installation? then that changes everything
[07:41:50] <sheep> you don't need to chroot. Just use blkid or lsblk to find the UUID for the filesystem, then edit /mnt/etc/fstab to use that UUID to mount at /home, then reboot and it should work
[07:42:50] <Scisista> can I just mount the home partition, then generate the UUID into the /mnt/etc/fstab instead?
[07:43:11] <sheep> you don't generate the UUID. The UUID was generated when you formatted

[13:16:40] <chkktri> Evening, so I have accidentally unpacked gentoo stage3 tar over my root filesystem instead of /mnt. Luckily it was systemd flavor so system still was in half-working state. In following few weeks I reinstalled most of core packages, it logs in into my user but is still half-usable. Current symptoms: user.slice is not seen in systemctl status, XDG_ enviroments are not set and loginctl displays no sessions. Any idea where should I go from here?
[13:16:51] * jason1234 evilop should be evil and use fltk evilwm or evilwm ;)
[13:17:02] <evilop> history of slackware is actually kinda interesting, pat didn't actually want to release "slackware" at all
[13:17:12] <jason1234> really?
[13:17:15] <evilop> yes
[13:17:20] <jason1234> what he wanted?
[13:18:18] <evilop> jason1234: slackware was basically just some notes that pat had written after his teacher had shown him how to install sls
[13:18:32] <jason1234> few years later the debian came from pixart and we got slow slack fadding away. 
[13:18:36] <jason1234> ah wow nice to know

[14:45:48] <Namarrgon> you should always update before you report issues
[14:45:59] <Franciman> oh well I did update
[14:46:07] <Namarrgon> aside from that, arch's kernels don#t enforce signature verification
[14:46:21] <Franciman> so I must be doing something wrong
[14:46:31] <Namarrgon> yes, it's most likely something else
[14:46:34] <Franciman> Namarrgon: this bug is really old, it was introduced around kernel 4.16
[14:46:47] <Franciman> and it is in the firmware
[14:46:55] <Franciman> I mean, they changed a data representation of a structure
[14:47:06] <Franciman> the firmware should deal with this grecefully
[14:47:14] <Franciman> but it looks like it is bugged
[14:48:51] <Franciman> anyways thanks a lot!

[20:51:21] <das_j> Hi, it's that weird NixOS coreutils maintainer again. Just wanted to let you know about another coreutils bug which may cause corrupted data on ZFS when using cp. NixOS decided to patch it out of cp until fixed by the ZFS maintainers. Arch is the only other Distro I know of that also uses Coreutils 9.0
[20:52:01] <das_j> All relevant links, including the ZFS issue, the coreutils issue, and our patch to remove the new behaviour from cp are here: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/143208

[20:55:45] <jelle> plenty people using zfs, so surely it is worth it
[20:55:58] <Foxboron> jelle: thats for the coreutils maintainer to decide though
[20:56:08] * jelle thinks Foxboron is too strict :)
[20:56:09] <yamii> Is there any chance that the linux-mainline AUR package will move to official repos in the future?
[20:56:15] <jelle> yamii: no
[20:56:18] <Foxboron> jelle: nah, I have patched zfs issues with lxd before

[20:56:28] <yamii> jelle: why though?
[20:56:29] <das_j> Yeah, of course it's not. It's a bit awkward since the problem is caused by the coreutils update (which is in the core repo) but the filesystem where the actualy bug is is in the AUR
[20:56:39] <jelle> yamii: it's the rc release, why would we package that

[20:57:29] <yamii> because it's popular and there seems to be a constant maintainer for it

[20:58:29] <Foxboron> yamii: There being a constant maintainer in the AUR doesn't imply there would be one in the repos.

[21:43:26] <teraflops> just as a sidenote
[21:44:50] <WhoNeedszZz> I guess the Mandela Effect is real then. I must have been in a different universe the past 15 years

[21:53:03] <AdloOnCD> hi everyone, I'm having an issue with Steam, can't launch any games - posted in a couple places on Reddit but was wondering if anyone here might be able to help. If this isn't the right place to ask about that sort of thing then no prob
[21:53:30] <snek> did you just update?
[21:53:34] <AdloOnCD> and this is on arch linux, and i can provide you way more detailed info if you need it, that's just the ultra cliffnotes
[21:54:02] <AdloOnCD> I did update, but it was broken before I updated, and I tried updating as a response to that - no difference either way
[21:54:02] *** Joins: Brottweiler (~brott@user/brottweiler)
[21:54:34] <snek> cuz there was just a weird release that broke my graphics driver, which i noticed when steam wasn't launching correctly
[21:54:38] <snek> had to update stuff again
[21:55:00] <AdloOnCD> did you just run pacman -Syu again or did you do anything else?
[21:55:30] <AdloOnCD> either way updating again now, I'll paste the OP here in case anyone wants to take a look
