[13:00:36] <akik> hi
[13:01:13] <akik> is there a way to check which of my local image hashes is not connected to any of my local tagged images?
[13:01:45] <akik> i think theres's some image hashes left from failed builds
[13:08:12] <jmcantrell> is there a way to use btrfs within a docker container?
[13:11:09] <akik> jmcantrell: if you put /var/lib/docker on btrfs then it uses btrfs. i think there was some capabilities that you need to add or privileged mode, but i don't for sure how it is now
[13:11:52] <jmcantrell> the filesystem in the container would be btrfs in that case?
[13:12:10] <akik> jmcantrell: yes
[13:12:39] <jmcantrell> that's interesting, but i'm not sure it's going to help me for what i'm working on.
[13:12:44] <akik>  Storage Driver: btrfs
[13:12:59] <akik> that shows on my docker info and i didn't need to anything special for it

[13:14:22] <jmcantrell> are you using btrfs?
[13:14:34] <jmcantrell> on the host filesystem, that is
[13:14:44] <akik> jmcantrell: yes
[13:14:51] <jmcantrell> ok
[13:15:19] <akik> jmcantrell: i can try if cp --reflink=yes works as  a container user
[13:16:33] <akik> yes "cp --reflink=always file file2" works in the container
[13:17:14] <jmcantrell> did you have to tell docker to use the btrfs storage driver?
[13:17:27] <akik> jmcantrell: no it somehow picked it up itself
[13:17:39] <akik> maybe because /var/lib/docker is on btrfs
[13:18:33] <jmcantrell> ok. i'm trying it now. i need to be able to create subvolumes within the container
[13:20:18] <akik> jmcantrell: are you running docker swarm? i think that was the obstacle to me
[13:20:38] <jmcantrell> no swarm
[13:20:45] <akik> i faintly remember that you'd need to give the container CAP_SYS_ADMIN
[13:20:57] <jmcantrell> what's that?
[13:21:04] <akik> linux capability
[13:21:14] <jmcantrell> oh

[13:27:16] <njka> LuchoCR[m]: when *bsd starts using a linux kernel... docker will support it :)
[13:27:38] <LuchoCR[m]> njka: OK, and Darwin???
[13:28:38] <njka> darwin uses a mach kernel... ( i.e. not linux ) and therefore cannot run in docker
[13:29:12] <njka> containers share the kernel w/the host machine... so you see the problem?
[13:29:33] <LuchoCR[m]> njka: And BSD uses linux kernel???
[13:29:55] <akik> LuchoCR[m]: absolutely not
[13:30:10] <njka> LuchoCR[m]: no
[13:30:18] <LuchoCR[m]> akik: OK, so, FreeBSD supports Docker??? njka 
[13:30:21] <njka> no
[13:30:34] <LuchoCR[m]> njka: Why???
[13:30:37] <akik> what is this ?
[13:30:51] <njka> freebsd has its own kernel... ( that is not a linux kernel )
[13:31:02] <njka> LuchoCR[m]: you should read a bit into how docker actually works
[13:31:19] <njka> and the differences between containers and virtual machines
[13:32:18] <LuchoCR[m]> njka: So, please, i can run using Docker, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed???
[13:32:47] <njka> opensuse uses the linux kernel... so yes, you can run it in docker :)
[13:32:58] <njka> i don't know what tumbleweed is
[13:33:31] <jmcantrell> akik: docker created a bunch of subvolumes after brought up a container. do you know what they're for? they're still there even after removing the container
[13:35:34] <njka> LuchoCR[m]: ok, so it looks like "Tumbleweed" is version of opensuse... so yes, it should run in a docker container
[13:36:12] <akik> jmcantrell: not sure but they probably have a reason to exist
[13:36:29] <jmcantrell> no doubt
[13:36:51] <akik> # btrfs subv list -a /var/lib/docker | wc -l
[13:36:52] <akik> 248
[13:37:10] <njka> every time i see ppl talking about btrfs i think about the american slang term "butter face" :)
[13:37:20] <akik> i keep 30 dailiy snapshots
[13:38:22] <LuchoCR[m]> njka: And in Docker container, i can run FreeBSD???
[13:38:44] <njka> no
[13:38:45] <akik> LuchoCR[m]: no 
[13:39:04] <akik> freebsd is a totally different os than gnu+linux
[13:39:07] <njka> again, you can only run things that use a linux kernel in docker containers
[13:39:34] <njka> docker containers share the kernel and namespace w/the host is
[13:39:36] <njka> erm
[13:39:37] <njka> s/is/os
[13:40:54] <LuchoCR[m]> akik: So, what project can run FreeBSD in linux???
[13:41:07] <akik> LuchoCR[m]: give it a rest
[13:41:08] <njka> if you need to run something that doesn't have a linux kernel... you'll need a proper hypervisor
[13:41:15] <njka> ( like kvm or something )
[13:41:46] <akik> LuchoCR[m]: there's kfreebsd that you can run linux userland on freebsd kernel
[13:42:19] <akik> LuchoCR[m]: why do you ask this? run freebsd if you want bsd
[13:42:23] <njka> that just sounds kinky :)
[13:42:27] <njka> yeah
[13:42:33] <njka> what akik said :)

[13:52:27] <jmcantrell> if i just want to run a test script in my container, what's the best way to do that? do i need docker-compose? i just want it to run the test and exit. i already have a dockerfile that prepares the environment
[13:53:09] <akik> jmcantrell: if the container is running, you can use docker exec
[13:54:06] <jmcantrell> is there a way to automate running the container, then exec'ing the test, then stopping the container?
[13:54:22] <njka> jmcantrell: sure... shell alias
[13:54:46] <njka> or just script it
[13:55:13] <njka> ^^
[13:55:38] <jmcantrell> should i use docker-compose?
[13:55:51] <njka> i wouldn't
[13:56:11] <njka> seems overkill
[13:56:44] <njka> i mean, if you just need to run 1 container which runs 1 test...
[13:57:26] <akik> jmcantrell: or include it in the dockerfile if it's always the same script
[13:57:26] <njka> why not just make the test script the entrypoint
[13:57:37] <akik> it's hard to know what you want to do
[13:58:20] <jmcantrell> njka: would that be with a CMD?
[13:59:41] <njka> well, entrypoint is probably what you want
[13:59:54] <njka> if it's just a simple script w/no args or anything
[14:00:04] <njka> CMD and ENTRYPOINT are different :)
[14:00:06] <LuchoCR[m]> Usenet uses Torrent files???
[14:00:33] <jmcantrell> like `ENTRYPOINT [ "./test.sh" ]`?
[14:01:15] <njka> sure
[14:01:51] <njka> jmcantrell: there is no harm in just trying stuff out :)
[14:01:59] <LuchoCR[m]> njka: Usenet uses Torrent files???
[14:02:08] <LuchoCR[m]> njka: Yes or no???
[14:02:12] <njka> LuchoCR[m]: no... core dumps... for sure...
[14:02:13] <jmcantrell> i am trying it. i'm just not having much luck

[14:03:04] <njka> LuchoCR[m]: usenet either uses core dumps or uucp...
[14:03:10] <jmcantrell> the image builds, but i'm not sure how to run it and see the output of the test script
[14:03:16] <njka> you should bing this :)
[14:03:47] <njka> jmcantrell: you need to learn how to use docker my friend :)
[14:04:08] <jmcantrell> i do! i'm trying :)
[14:04:15] <njka> it seems as if you're kinda just jumping into this w/out having done much reading about it :)
[14:04:19] <akik> jmcantrell: you run it with docker run
[14:04:21] <njka> ( not trying to sound mean or anything )
[14:04:47] <njka> jmcantrell: so i would recommend checking out some docker clips on yt
[14:05:23] <njka> and then just browse github for other people's dockerfiles
[14:06:07] <njka> this is how i initially started teaching myself about docker...
[14:06:22] <njka> but now there is sooo much info and tutorials about it
[14:06:37] <njka> i started using docker back in like 2013-14 :)
[14:06:49] <njka> oh
[14:06:54] <njka> you know what
[14:06:55] <jmcantrell> njka: it's ok. but i have actually done a bit of reading. it's just not clicking.
[14:07:12] <njka> search yt for "jessie frazelle docker"
[14:07:20] <jmcantrell> ok
[14:07:26] <njka> jessie did some excellent talks re: docker
[14:07:35] <jmcantrell> thanks
[14:07:51] <njka> jmcantrell: i hear you... there is some "bang head on desk" that is required
[14:07:53] <njka> :)
[14:08:05] <jmcantrell> heh :)
[14:08:11] <njka> but seriously tho... check out some of jessie's talks on yt
[14:08:14] <njka> she's a boss
[14:08:39] <jmcantrell> looking at them now
[14:08:53] <njka> it will open your mind too... people have somewhat of a set idea of what docker is for... but you can do a lot of cool shit with it :)
[14:09:05] <njka> and jess does a *lot* of cool shit with it
[14:09:37] <njka> jmcantrell: i would also recommend you check out udemy.com... they offer paid online courses... but they're always having crazy sales
[14:09:48] <njka> you can get like $50 and $100 courses for like $10 
[14:09:57] <njka> and they have some decent courses
[14:10:18] <jmcantrell> i might. funds are tight right now, but you can't beat $10
[14:10:48] <njka> setup a go fund me... maybe some ppl here will donate...
[14:10:51] <njka> :)
[14:11:03] <njka> at the end of the day tho, it's $10
[14:11:10] <njka> ( or whatever your local currency is )
[14:11:49] <njka> if you end up using docker professionally at work... the $10 course pays for itself very quickly :)
[14:12:12] <jmcantrell> i'm sure
[14:12:26] <njka> jmcantrell: i can tell 100% that it does
[14:13:52] <njka> me and a co-worker were playing w/docker back in '13-'14 like i said... and within probably 9 months... we were using docker heavily in almost all development... and i was deploying it in production ( at a small scale initially )
[14:14:15] <njka> i was using docker in production back when even the docker ppl were like "Docker is not ready for production!"
[14:14:41] <njka> jmcantrell: you have a linux machine handy i'm assuming, yes??
[14:14:56] <jmcantrell> yes
[14:15:00] <njka> cool
[14:15:28] <njka> watch a few of jessie's talks... you'll be running all your desktop apps in containers by the end of this coming week :)
[14:15:31] <njka> you watch :)
[14:16:02] <njka> jessie is oddly presuasive and you will most likely get inspired :)
[14:16:07] <jmcantrell> interesting use for it. you do that for the sandboxing?
[14:16:15] <jmcantrell> heh. i hope so
[14:16:21] <njka> jmcantrell: 100%
[14:16:39] <njka> now, my linux hosts are extremely bare-bones... no clutter
[14:16:53] <njka> base os and docker for the most part :)
[14:16:56] <jmcantrell> does she go into that use case?
[14:17:23] <njka> um
[14:17:29] <jmcantrell> how does the container see your dotfiles? you have them mapped in as a volume?
[14:17:35] <njka> she basically shows you how to containerize lots of apps...
[14:17:53] <njka> the use-case is you don't jack up your host w/tons of dependencies and such :)
[14:17:58] <jmcantrell> oh ok, this should be interesting

[14:18:13] <njka> and then, you can take that container and run it basically anywhere you have docker installed :)
[14:18:51] <njka> docker containers are meant to be simple, predictable and portable :)
[14:19:36] <njka> for example, one of my favorite containers is my awscli container...

[16:39:34] <Tach> artok I want to use dynamic volumenames

[18:53:36] <artok> thanks for correcting me
[18:55:19] <tabakhase> guess that said, it isnt much helped that you sometimes see people doing "env_file: \n - .env" :D -- or the fact that a whole lot of "other things" consume ".env" as well :P ("dotenv"-packages are pretty hyped in nodeJS & ruby for example...)
[18:56:21] <Tach> artok it was not fully clear in the documentation, sorry
[18:56:44] <artok> yeah, seen bind mounting .env also
[19:12:43] <Tach> artok there is nothing else you can apply on a docker-compose other then sed or creating the full compose file ?
[19:14:59] <Tach> tabakhase aha but which format does it need to have ?
[19:15:12] <artok> for the usability I'd go with some templating rather than trying to insert stuff
[19:15:24] <Tach> I agree
[19:15:26] <artok> when you have template output, it is easier to debug
[19:15:56] <Tach> for sure
[19:16:14] <Tach> I think I can work with an additional .env file
[19:16:44] <tabakhase> not much of "format" var=val\nvar2=val 2\nval3=moe - and use ${var} in compose file (also supports ${var:-fallback})
[19:17:23] <tabakhase> for more than that, compose can deepmerge too (-f 1.yml -f 2.yml) or env COMPOSE_FILES
[19:18:09] <Tach> I canl call different files yes, but it doesn't make it more flexible as in variable
[19:18:56] <Tach> I could investigate if I can add services to a stack
[19:20:55] <tabakhase> merging put it in one stack, thats not the same as "multiple dirs with compose files" but more in the idea of "docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose-local-db.yml up" - if you for example usually use some hosted-db, but want to run local mysql in dev
