[04:19:23] <greycat> if it's intended to be a wrapper around the POSIX du, you will need to take some sort of measures to find out the correct path of the system's du command (perhaps by iterating over several likely locations until you find it), and then invoke it by that path

[05:56:40] <emanuele6> cat will always be an external program.
[05:57:04] <emanuele6> either way it makes no sense to think about "fastness" if the target is POSIX.
[05:57:17] <wiscii> yes, but for this problem it does appear that sh read is actually slower than cat, marginally
[05:57:34] <Friithian> does that slowness matter? Are you putting in massive files into a variable?
[05:57:45] <emanuele6> wiscii: that does not make any sense
[05:57:57] <emanuele6> POSIX is not a real shell. it is a specification.
[05:58:22] <greycat> to read one line of text, 'read' will be faster than $(cat) or $(<)
[05:58:38] <greycat> $(cat) does a fork and an exec, and $(<) does a fork

[06:58:17] <mike18> hi how can i remove all lines starting with: GET /data/v1/std/meta ?
[06:58:27] <mike18> i tried: sed "s/^GET\t/data/v1/std/meta//g"
[06:58:33] <mike18> how to write that correct?
[06:58:36] <larryv> all lines in what? a file? a stream?
[06:58:37] <greycat> grep -v '^GET /data/v1/std/meta'
[06:58:48] <mike18> stream
[06:58:56] <mike18> i use pipe before
[06:59:43] <llua> $10 on it coming from cat
[07:05:45] <mike18> value=$(<data.txt); echo $value | sed "" ...
[07:06:10] <wiscii> no $10
[07:06:13] <mike18> can i use sed too?
[07:06:35] <greycat> ... wait, you're the OP.  So this wasn't a joke response.
[07:06:40] <larryv> LOL
[07:07:48] <greycat> grep -v '^GET /data/v1/std/meta' data.txt
[07:08:50] <mike18> i know grep works
[07:08:59] <mike18> but sed isnt supposed to be used like that?
[07:09:06] <mike18> or can sed only find and replace ?
[07:09:09] <greycat> *plonk*
[07:09:21] <mike18> greycat: what do you mean?
[07:09:31] <llua> you made his ignore list

[07:10:10] <greybot> mike18: The sound a name makes when it hits a kill file (or /ignore list).
[07:10:11] <larryv> well done
[07:10:31] <mike18> ok well
[07:10:57] <larryv> sure, you could do it with sed. but you can also use grep, as has already been demonstrated
[07:11:19] <mike18> i just try to understand what i did wrong here: sed "s/^GET\t/data/v1/std/meta//g"
[07:11:50] <greycat> (by the way, unquoted  echo $value  will NOT work at all; your line breaks will be lost)
[07:12:17] *** Quits: ormaaj2 (~ormaaj2@user/ormaaj) (Quit: Client closed)
[07:13:13] <larryv> mike18: 1) \t isn't a thing in POSIX BRE, 2) you can't have unescaped / in your regular expression or replacement while you're already using / as the delimiter, 3) even if that all worked, this wouldn't delete lines with that prefix, it would just cut out the prefix and leave the rest

[07:13:38] <mike18> larryv: so sed here will not work at all?
[07:13:45] <greycat> 4) there's no tabs in HTTP GET commands
[07:13:54] <llua> how you used it won't work.
[07:13:57] <mike18> its from a log
[07:14:21] <larryv> the log inserts a tab after "GET"?
[07:14:38] <mike18> its from python http logging
[07:14:46] <greycat> (sed can delete lines of input, but you don't use the s command for that; you use the d command; and it'll be MUCH HARDER to write because of the literal slashes in the search pattern)
[07:15:29] <mike18> yeah see what you mean: sed "s/^GET \/data\/v1\/std\/meta//"

[07:32:18] <greycat> if the space after GET can actually be "a space or a tab", then you can write a regex to match that, ideally using [[:space:]]
[07:32:42] <larryv> (also assuming there isn't some as-yet undisclosed requirement that would make grep unsuitable)
[07:33:34] <greycat> using grep -v means you don't have to put slashes around the regex, which in turn means you don't have to escape the slashes in the search string with backslashes

[10:14:58] <geirha> I'm surprised that works at all
[10:16:03] <geirha> what's the goal?
[10:18:35] <geirha> if all you want to do is print the second column, use either a while read loop or awk, not both
[10:18:44] <geirha> awk '{print $2}' sample.txt
[10:19:06] <geirha> while read -r host ip _ ; do printf '%s\n' "$ip" ; done < sample.txt
[10:19:54] <geirha> in your code, you didn't give awk any input, so it read from stdin, which was the remainder of sample.txt
[10:20:14] <han-solo> i'm curious to know what's inside sample.txt
[10:20:53] <geirha> me too, but I think it's the last part of the paste
[10:21:06] <_ev> unzip -l ovpn.zip | awk '{print $4}' | awk -F '/' '{print $2}' | awk '$1 ~ /^us[0-9]/' | awk -F '.' '$4 ~ /^tcp/' | awk -F '.' '{print $1 "." $2 "." $3}' > nord_vpn.txt
[10:21:08] <geirha> since the last part clearly don't match what the output should be
[10:21:23] <_ev> Messy, I know. But that is what is inside of sample.txt. Well sample is a cleaned version of nord_vpn.txt
[10:21:23] <geirha> yikes
[10:21:26] <_ev> just messing around.
[10:21:42] <geirha> I'd combine all those into one awk

[12:31:08] <[twisti]> i still need bash parsing, because there are env variables in use in baz
[12:31:19] <selckin> !heredoc
[12:31:19] <greybot> Here documents. cat <<EOF followed by several lines of text, followed by the literal string EOF on a new line, NOT indented. The portion between the EOFs is passed to the command as standard input. If 'EOF' is 'quoted', substitutions WON'T be done; otherwise they are. See <<- for the indented variety.
[12:31:45] <[twisti]> same problem, i would think ?
[12:31:50] <isabella> you put baz in single quotes so i figured that there wouldn't be any variables in it...
[12:32:01] <[twisti]> the actual sed statement is sed 's/${TARGET_DB}\([\x60\x27]\)/bak_dbt_${TARGET_DB}\1/g'
[12:32:18] <grawity> hmm putting the usage of bash -c aside
[12:32:21] <[twisti]> isabella: right, but the whole of the sed 'baz' call is inside the ""
[12:32:22] <grawity> or actually no
[12:32:27] <grawity> why do you need to call bash -c here
[12:32:48] <isabella> because they're putting this in like a systemd unit
[12:32:48] <grawity> is it being run from something that is not bash?
[12:32:52] <[twisti]> because of evil dark magic outside the scope of this question
[12:32:54] <grawity> ah, ugly
[12:33:10] <[twisti]> ugly indeed
[12:33:19] <grawity> but it's relevant because of the following question about when the $vars are supposed to be expanded – by bash -c or by the outer thing
[12:33:30] <selckin> or not at all
[12:33:50] <[twisti]> by bash -c, and that part is working fine, its just the ` and ' that dont work

[12:35:07] <selckin> # echo $'$foo\''
[12:35:09] <shbot> selckin: $foo'
[12:35:31] * selckin doesn't actually know what other side effects that could have
[12:36:44] <[twisti]> foo bar is actually this monstrosity, and dont say i didnt warn you, followed by about a thousand arguments to mysqldump: bash -c "set -o pipefail; time docker exec -i $TARGET_CONTAINER mysql --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -u $TARGET_LOGIN -p$TARGET_PASSWORD bak_dbt_$TARGET_DB < <( docker exec -i $TARGET_CONTAINER mysqldump ... | sed stuff)"
[12:37:10] <grawity> yep definitely should go in a standalone script
[12:37:10] <[twisti]> and to top it off, run via gitlab ci, so the above sits in a yaml file and is executed inside a docker container
[12:37:39] <Soliton> !injection

[12:38:37] <Soliton> there is no need to inject at all with bash -c (if that is even reasonable).
[12:40:27] <[twisti]> i dont really know what that means

[12:42:14] <[twisti]> just the one
[12:42:57] <grawity> if it just gets one DB, I'm a bit confused about why the sed is necessary
[12:43:04] <Soliton> what a cluster fuck honestly.
[12:43:14] <grawity> pretty sure you can literally mysqldump dbA | mysql dbB
[12:43:33] <[twisti]> right, but then views in dbB, for example, will query data from dbA
[12:43:38] <grawity> ah, views
[12:43:46] <[twisti]> stored procedures too
[12:43:57] <grawity> didn't know those reference the DB as well
[12:44:01] <[twisti]> im not happy with it either, but at least this way works, other than the escaping of `'
[12:44:18] <[twisti]> they dont have to, but they can, depends on which tool the person who made them used
[12:44:50] <selckin> swap to " quotes then and more escapes
[12:44:51] <grawity> also, instead of [`'] wouldn't \b work as well?

[14:52:57] <hingoanashi1209> is there any way of constructing and then expanding a string like {a,b}{a,b} in a bash script  i.e. expanding it to aa ab ba bb having provided the a and b either on the command line or through read?
[14:53:34] <hingoanashi1209> I apologize if this is a stupid question.

[14:55:28] <hingoanashi1209> well I'd like to know if it was a plain old variable first.
[14:55:42] <lopid> if?
[14:56:07] <hingoanashi1209> e.g.  x={a,b}{a,b}
[14:56:33] <hingoanashi1209> where the value of x is constructed in the script

[16:53:47] <geirha> !extglob
[16:53:47] <greybot> "Extended globs" (shopt -s extglob) allow you to say things like "all files that do not end in .jpg". See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob
[16:55:08] <Soliton> altnames should be an array or just contain the option argument.
[16:55:28] <Nod0n[m]> Oh no, it is not a bash script, it is /bin/sh which points to dash...
[16:56:01] <Nod0n[m]> Why do people such things? Bash is available but dash is used....
[16:56:32] <Soliton> sounds like you could switch it over to bash then.
[16:56:49] <Soliton> ls|grep is certainly terrible.
[16:57:23] <Nod0n[m]> I saw it and wanted to cry.
[16:57:46] <geirha> for certname in "$SSLDIR/certs"/*.pem ; do case $certname in */ca.pem) continue ;; esac ; break ; done
[16:58:15] <geirha> should do the same as the ls|grep crap
[16:58:15] <Nod0n[m]> I like that. 🙂
[16:59:19] <Nod0n[m]> Yes, but $certificate is used elsewhere to... The script just expects there is only one other cert and everything is based on this...

[17:32:44] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
[17:33:21] <jjakob> that's unfortunate, since I got used to it, and I haven't had a case where it didn't work as expected
[17:33:50] <phy1729> See the examples in the link, I guarantee you won't get them all right
[17:34:48] <jjakob> interesting, I'll read later
[17:35:13] <Soliton> seems bad to get used to reversed error handling. just handle errors normally.
[17:35:41] <jjakob> what do you mean "reversed" Soliton
[17:36:16] <Soliton> with set -e you workaround it in the cases it doesn't happen to do what you want.

[17:36:37] <Soliton> so you do silly stuff when you don't want to exit instead of handling the error cases.
[17:37:55] <jjakob> I like set -e because it makes for less bloated and simpler scripts

[17:42:44] <olspookishmagus> why won't sudo ls /boot/"*5.10*" give me the matching config,initrd,System.map,vmlinuz files?
[17:43:03] <Soliton> you quoted the glob.
[17:43:24] <Soliton> if you want a root shell to expand the glob you need to call a shell.
[17:43:45] <olspookishmagus> and if I wanted an ERE there? find?
[17:44:02] <Soliton> if your find does ERE, maybe.
[17:44:06] <jjakob> the current shell, if non-root, won't be able to expand the glob, so sudo won't help here, you'd need to sudo sh -c 'ls /boot/*5.10*'

[18:04:01] <jelly> xx, ext* are very inefficient when you do that, ext4 is better than ext2-3 but still things slow down when you deal with more than say 10k entries in a directory
[18:04:03] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[18:04:18] <chilversc> ah, so I can just assign the glob pattern to an array and that deals with all the edge cases such as someone putting a new line in a file name?

[18:06:27] <jelly> xx, mkdir -p {0..9}/{0..9}/{0..9} and fill each of the 1000 leaf dirs with touched files, or something
[18:07:05] <chilversc> xx: there is a limit on the number of files in a directory, iirc its 65,536
[18:07:33] <chilversc> well entries, so that also includes directories, . and ..
[18:08:16] <jelly> chilversc, ext3 used to have a 32k limit on _subdirectories_ because of all the .. hardlinks
[18:08:21] <chilversc> xx: also, rather than creating a lot of files, you could format a partition with less inodes, depending on what you're trying to do
[18:08:43] <jelly> but you could put a million files in a directory even on ext3

[21:36:48] <Swahili> Q: For some reason when I do foobar=$(cmd x y z), echo $foobar is empty, so I do foobar=$(cmd z y z &> .tmp && cat .tmp) then when I echo $foobar, I can see output.
[21:37:00] <Swahili> Is there a better way of doing this?
[21:37:51] <han-solo> what if you do `foobar=$(cmd x y z 2>&1); echo "$foobar"` # ?
[21:40:34] <Swahili> han-solo: it works, nice! but after isolating it, I actually get the original so not sure what happened in the previous context. will investigate. Thank you :)
[21:41:05] <han-solo> so now `foobar=$(cmd x y z), echo $foobar` # works ?
[21:42:23] <Swahili> han-solo: in isolation yes, but in a separate script does not, but the 2>& you mentioned does
[21:42:35] <Swahili> in both
[21:42:35] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[21:42:55] <han-solo> what does "in isolation " refers to ?
[21:43:48] <Swahili> han-solo: my apologies, yes, that is created a separate foo.sh script just to test that part. While, when running the same commands in a different file it echo empty but with 2>&1 works
[21:44:25] *** Joins: ChmEarl (~chmearl@user/chmearl)
[21:44:52] <han-solo> and both times, `echo $foobar` outputs same thing ? that's weird
[21:44:59] <emg> doubt it
[21:45:03] <emg> mos tlikely it prints to stdout
[21:45:09] <emg> err, stderr
[21:45:18] <emg> so the separate script prints it to stderr, the echo is empty, but he sees it
[21:45:22] *** Joins: Gerula (~Gerula@user/gerula)
[21:45:33] <emg> the big script prints to stderr and it gets lost for ... reasons ... and the echo is empty
[21:45:55] <emg> Swahili: if you do, in your stand alone script foobar=$(cmd x y z 2>/dev/null); echo "$foobar"     what happens
[21:46:13] <Swahili> emg: ok I'll try! In isolation or in the bigger script which echos empty?
[21:46:16] <Swahili> I'll do it there
[21:46:22] <emg> in isolation
[21:46:33] <emg> or better yet, just in your shell, don't need a script
[21:46:36] <han-solo> what's this `cmd` ?
[21:46:38] <emg> that would tell you when it's printing
[21:46:42] <Swahili> emg: ok I'll do in isolation
[21:47:05] <Swahili> han-solo: it's a program that makes a network call and returns some text
[21:47:33] <Swahili> emg: echo was empty!
[21:47:55] <emg> yeah, your command is writing to stderr, not stdout, in order to capture it correctly you need the 2>&1 as han-solo said above
[21:48:08] <Swahili> emg: amazing! you people having amazing skills

[21:50:04] <Swahili> emg: it's not popular, carxis args
[21:50:19] <Swahili> han-solo: so when debugging we should output to stderr?
