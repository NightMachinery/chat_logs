[00:28:36] <oerheks> why would the writespreed higher on an idle system?
[00:28:50] <oerheks> seems like to me that it does not do that much.
[00:28:54] <Walex> Linkandzelda: it is a very common issue. Look for benchmarks for 4K random writes on a consume flash SSD.
[00:29:17] <oerheks> 10 mb/s measured over a period of time..
[00:29:29] <Walex> pretty good actually.
[00:29:37] <oerheks> so, is your server unresponsive ?
[00:29:48] <Walex> many flash SSDs cannot do as much as 10MB/s on small committed writes.
[00:30:03] <Linkandzelda> its a fresh install of ubuntu, no services, no data
[00:30:10] <Walex> it is 20 times faster than on HDDs.
[00:30:21] <Walex> that 10MB/s is still 20 times faster than on HDDs.

[00:30:56] <Linkandzelda> the same test on mt laptop gives me 400MB/s write

[03:44:23] <Walex> src: another small issue is that SNAPs can only access files under '/home/', so if you want to build anywhere else you need a "bind" mount

[06:04:41] <tomreyn> hmm maybe you need to find a way to reduce libepub's logging level
[06:04:47] <tomreyn> had you raised the previously?
[06:04:53] <bandit-led> yes i do that would be awesome
[06:05:28] <bandit-led> https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=390284 bug report similar from 2018
[06:05:33] <ubottu> KDE bug 390284 in okular "no such file errors" [Normal, Confirmed]
[06:06:37] <bandit-led> I asked about it this afternoon and tried to add the information that you mentioned
[06:08:21] <sarnold> bandit-led: you might be able to change the .desktop file for okular to use > /dev/null 2>/dev/null -- I think that might work. if that just breaks it all, then it should be possible to write a script to do something similar
[06:08:59] <bandit-led> sarnold, will go look ty!
[06:09:17] <bandit-led> i looked but couldnt figure it out
[06:09:20] <bandit-led> brb
[06:09:56] <tomreyn> bandit-led: i mistyped, meant to ask: had you raised the libepub log level previously?

[06:30:05] <sarnold> thyriaen: actually finding out how to trace those actual api calls is quite a bit more work than just suggesting this, though :) heh
[06:30:16] <bandit-led> i think you need to call that from xll or from your login manager
[06:30:45] <bandit-led> what is your display manager.
[06:31:02] <thyriaen> uhm, the default one - i think gdm3 ?
[06:31:37] <bandit-led> yes sorry i am slow tonight

[10:30:40] <lotuspsychje> bundtcake: lets have a look at your dmesg plz?
[10:34:03] <bundtcake> lotuspsychje: https://pastebin.com/KYp4HAcg I've seen this problem before with the Dynex monitor. Its been so long since I used xrandr for a custom monitor setting.
[10:35:17] <bundtcake> lotuspsychje: How to check if I'm on Xorg or Wayland right now?
[10:37:39] <lotuspsychje> bundtcake: im checking your amdgpu in dmesg seems like behaving properly to me
[10:39:22] <lotuspsychje> bundtcake: did you have this issue on previous ubuntu version(s) ?
[10:41:18] <bundtcake> lotuspsychje: no, but I had it on win10
[10:41:45] <lotuspsychje> bundtcake: so maybe its the way you connect that screen?
[10:41:51] <bundtcake> its hdmi
[10:42:29] <bundtcake> It does not have hdmi audio support, perhaps I should blacklist that
[10:43:01] <bundtcake> In win10 the amd settings were able to correct the problem.
[10:43:09] <lotuspsychje> bundtcake: maybe you should journalctl -f and plug out/back in monitor and see what errors you getting

[12:34:47] <Metamorphosis> Hello everyone, I had installed a browser called Brave browser which I found to be dangerous or scam, I removed it via "apt purge brave-browser brave-keyring" and then proceeded to remove its repo from packagemanger software sources list.
[12:35:17] <Metamorphosis> The problem however is that when I use the command "apt update" it says : An error occurred during the signature verification. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com stable InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A8580BDC82D3DC6C
[12:35:31] <Metamorphosis> How can I get rid of the left-over traces of this browser?
[12:35:41] <StyXman> does anyone know is itś possible to download the data for https://certification.ubuntu.com/ ? I'm looking for a new laptop and it would be nice to filter by specs instead of having to browse 137 hits: https://certification.ubuntu.com/desktop/models?release=20.04%20LTS&category=Laptop
[12:36:02] <StyXman> Metamorphosis: it's not scam, it's well known
[12:36:28] <Metamorphosis> StyXman looked very scammy to me. Anyways I want to get rid of it and stick to Firefox.
[12:36:35] <tomreyn> Metamorphosis: you'll probably have a file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave*  which you need to remove, yet
[12:36:54] <StyXman> Metamorphosis: check under the /etc/apt directory
[12:37:29] <lotuspsychje> StyXman: most laptop will run ubuntu fine, just need to think about some chipsets in your new laptop that could cause trouble more
[12:37:48] <lotuspsychje> StyXman: realtek and ralink chipsets for example
[12:38:00] <StyXman> Metamorphosis: I never tried it myself, I think I have my ffox pretty locked down with ublock origin as firewall (deny any 3rd party site by default) and noscript

[17:00:36] <Walex> RupertEverton: are you trying to create VMs as a non-"root" user?
[17:00:39] <TJ-> RupertEverton: so, it is available. The obvious issue then is that this gnome box thing doesn't have permissions to /dev/kvm
[17:01:45] <TJ-> RupertEverton: as Walex  has just suggested, if it is executing as your user then unless your user is a member of the 'kvm' group ("sudo adduser $USER kvm") then it won't be able to use hardware acceleration support

[17:39:46] <Guest92> Hello, please advise Is it possible to create zip archives (not tar.gz) with the "tar" command?

[17:41:00] <gry> Guest92: no, tar only does tar. For zip archives there are 'zip' and 'unzip' commands
[17:41:11] <oerheks> why, there is the zip tool to do that
[17:41:23] <gry> Guest92: (and xarchiver GUI probably does both)

[17:42:30] <oerheks> interesting..
[17:42:41] <gry> Guest92: file bug reports with the zip package, then, and suggest your favourite features to be added
[17:42:44] <Guest92> it can create xz, gz, bzip... I thought it can do zip too

[17:43:49] <oerheks> gzip is more universal than zip or tar

[21:57:22] <superkuh> Hi. Does anyone know if Canonical still has the source repos for 10.04 lucid anywhere? I'm looking for the 10.04 source of xchat-gnome so I can apply some patches for SSLv3 to disabled negotiation.
