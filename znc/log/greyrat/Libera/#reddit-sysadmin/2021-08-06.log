[06:17:36] <corn266> fucking retard
[06:17:41] <BitLocker> nah thats illegal
[06:18:20] <BitLocker> if someone opens the case, the system should be off, so halting would cause no corruption in legit circumstance.
[06:18:44] <corn266> yea, and for the purposes you're using the system for, to have this be a legitimate reason, is probably also illegal
[06:18:47] <cryptic1> FBI AGENT DETECTED
[06:19:02] <BitLocker> and if they are authorized to be opening the case, they ought to have the means of acquiring the recovery key, so clearing the TPM is no harm

[06:19:58] <BitLocker> but if they ain't legit, and they're gonna boot the system (so the TPM releases the BitLocker key into RAM), hose the RAM down with liquid nitrogen to slow down its ability to lose its memory, and move it into their RAM-reading contraption

[06:46:04] <cryptic1> I am reporting everyone here
[06:46:09] <BitLocker> xe0n, certificate inspection where it doesn't break the connection may not work as reliably (DNS host name, can't see URL if it doesn't understand TLS1.3 at all).  Also breaking for deep inspection would have the same issue
[06:46:10] <cryptic1> EVERYONE

[06:46:51] <xe0n> haha
[06:47:01] <BitLocker> I don't care if the GPO is needed... it's the description on it saying it will be removed in a "future" version that worries me
[06:47:25] <corn266> our new _actual-titled-systems-admin_ is starting monday and i'm so goddamn excited
[06:47:30] <BitLocker> I would hope, being open source, that if Chromium tried to force the world to use its pinning someone would fork it...
[06:47:31] <xe0n> and you've updated the admx templates for chrome\edge\whatever, yeah?
[06:47:46] <corn266> i will once again be elevated above you plebs

[06:48:18] <corn266> SOFTWARE ENGINEERS RISE UP
[06:48:21] <xe0n> speak for yourself...
[06:49:36] <BitLocker> xe0n, you don't use inspection at all?  Not even non-breaking inspection (which will be a thing of the past with ESNI becoming more popular)?
[06:50:07] <xe0n> not that i'm aware of, i dont manage the firewall lol
[06:50:48] <BitLocker> your firewall is blind to URLs, and only sees hostnames? (which are obsolete as a filtering or logging means since the rise of CDNs where the entire internet's hostname is [some gibberish].cloudflare.com or .aws.com or something)
[06:51:01] <corn266> xe0n got a spiffy new job nobbin off 2 days of the week and being in meetings the other 3
[06:51:10] <xe0n> i dont manage work's firewall

[06:53:04] <BitLocker> by the way - modern firewalls with inspection provide virus scanning of downloads, IPS, and interception of connections to known phishing sites by gullible people - companies don't only use SSL inspection if they want to spy or distrust people and need a porn/game/netflix blocker anymore
[06:53:32] <corn266> i block any sites that aren't porn
[06:53:36] <corn266> pussy
[06:53:59] <csws> lol place I'm at doesn't do TLS inspection
[06:54:01] <csws> they don't do a lot...
[06:54:04] <csws> like
[06:54:11] <csws> never had an issue with SSH tunnels
[06:54:18] <csws> idk what the security team does all day
[06:54:43] <corn266> bruh i control the firewalls over here and i can guarantee you idngaf
[06:54:50] <BitLocker> used to be SNI could be used for getting the URL because it was not encrypted during the handshake, so many firewalls can categorize and filter websites without breaking SSL/TLS
[06:55:12] <csws> yeah BitLocker the work firewall does SNI inspection
[06:56:25] <BitLocker> with the rise of ESNI (optional feature of TLS1.3), the SNI is encrypted.  So, if the same CDN carries stuff in different categories on the same hosts with the same IP and DNS name, and uses TLS1.3 with SNI, your firewall cannot tell them apart without breaking TLS
[06:56:54] <corn266> so i may be a bit behind
[06:57:10] <csws> oh that's cool
[06:57:13] <corn266> but shouldn't a firewall with MIM be sufficient in protecting against that?
[06:57:19] <BitLocker> So they you have to make your firewall a trusted CA in your environment and let it spoof certs and be a man in the middle, even if you don't need virus scanning, DLP, and all that other stuff.  You need it now/for the future, for things that could be done with SNI inspection in the past
[06:57:26] <BitLocker> yeah
[06:57:34] <csws> yeah zscaler, umbrella, etc. have their own root certs you install
[06:58:01] <corn266> okay? so just throw your own CA certs on a machine when you're imaging it
[06:58:09] <BitLocker> corn266, but your firewall needs to support TLS1.3 with post-quantum encryption algorithms if the chromium project is planning on refusing to fall back to TLS1.2 or even TLS1.3/RSA in the future.  Or else you need firefox
[06:58:24] <catbeard> i'd put the ca file available via http:// on a central server
[06:58:33] <catbeard> and put the http:// link to download it in the image setup
[06:58:36] <corn266> well then chromium will fall into the fucking sun
[06:58:43] <corn266> fly too high, you know?
[06:58:43] <BitLocker> corn266, that's not even needed.  Deploy them in group policy.  Firewalls should be subordinate CA's under your enterprise root CA
[06:58:43] <catbeard> then when it's time to change CA out, replace the file on the central server
[06:58:58] <corn266> lmao
[06:59:12] <corn266> implying everyone uses an enterprise root CA
[06:59:32] <catbeard> i mean only 250M people use CloudFlare
[06:59:34] <catbeard> ...
[06:59:57] <catbeard> :)
[07:00:15] <catbeard> cloudflare teams and forced dns dstnat
[07:00:19] <catbeard> good times
[07:00:27] <corn266> gonna be a lot less if enterprise doesn't support their forced retardation
[07:00:42] <BitLocker> well, if you have a NGFW in your network I assume you're operating on a scale where you have a domain network (instead of local accounts on workstations).  So you have Windows Server.  You have the means to set up a PKI
[07:00:58] <corn266> bruh
[07:01:14] <corn266> a fortigate 60E is cheap as fuck and is considered an NGFW
[07:01:34] <corn266> you could use that shit at home (and many do)
[07:01:39] <BitLocker> how much are those new?
[07:01:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> if you have to ask you probably can't afford it
[07:01:51] <catbeard> not good for work
[07:02:35] <csws> if you use a hosted MITM proxy like zscaler you have to use their certs
[07:02:41] <corn266> what like $600?
[07:02:47] <catbeard> or just set up nginx as a forward proxy
[07:02:49] <corn266> I'd buy one if i gave enough fucks
[07:03:04] <csws> last joint used zscaler as a transparent proxy
[07:03:06] <csws> it wasn't tooooo bad
[07:03:09] <catbeard> or squid with ssl bump with your CA
[07:03:20] <csws> yeah but nobody wants to do that
[07:03:28] <csws> just pay someone some money, setup the ipsec tunnel ???? profit!
[07:03:32] <catbeard> so unless you do cert pinning then works nice
[07:03:36] <corn266> i use octopus for the hentai in their instruction manual
[07:03:45] <csws> wat
[07:03:50] <corn266> huh?

[08:58:43] <sd> 14<N​oob> I don't think I was typing in the right stuff in Google. Is there a good tool for a setup where say one office has a 10tb file share on a Linux server, and I can setup a small remote server with 1-2tb to cache the most accessed files with a set cache time?  That why the main location doesn't saturate upload, and remote location doesn't saturate download on slower links.  Also would like it to be scalable for multiple sites. A good chunk of it is vide
[09:07:09] <sd> 02<r​yalln> So like some file servers have a copy of most used fils on SSD's instead of HDD
[09:07:15] <sd> 02<r​yalln> but you want that for remote
[09:13:55] <sd> 14<N​oob> Ya friend asked for my help. Seems like they have 10tb already at a primary office. Then they purchased a training library from another company with the initial video library is 10tb also, and they get more as they're made.
[09:16:02] <sd> 14<N​oob> Main office only has 100mb upload. Satellite offices have 50-100mb download.  Just trying to make it so that "these 1tb worth of files are accessed daily, store for X hours" rest is accessed infrequently, keep pulling from main office
[09:17:18] <sd> 14<N​oob> Then as new videos added and are the main accessed ones, it can automatically detect the change in frequency to change the cache. Looking for a cheaper solution than a cloud storage solution or having a full replica.

[10:54:21] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> It’ll be using an RDS gateway, but how would I solve the DNS issue to say “I need to connect to this specific VM”
[10:54:47] <DrZak> if you dont control dns, you shouldnt be using
[10:54:49] <DrZak> it
[10:54:54] <DrZak> just make up a domain - dog
[10:55:07] <DrZak> and fix up your public ip addresses there
[10:55:08] <DrZak> voila
[10:55:18] <xe0n> you configure the machine as an rds host and publish the apps or desktop?
[10:55:42] <xe0n> or you allow the page on the rds web page to enter a machine name and be forwarded to that machine
[10:55:50] <DrZak> also - if you have public RDP open directly, not via web gateway
[10:55:55] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> I can publish desktops? Jesus. That sounds disgusting but it would resolve my problem
[10:55:57] <DrZak> you are basically asking for anal rape
[10:56:46] <DrZak> unless you are in india, im guessing it's a tradition over there, just like lack of basic sanitary regimen and burning women
[10:57:15] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> I work for a subsidiary company and the only way into our network is through the parent co’s VPN and I don’t control that DNS zone. Currently it’s one to one NAT addressing between the two networks

[10:58:09] <DrZak> yea and security, where you are going to get 99% - hell no
[10:58:09] <DrZak> :)
[10:58:20] <DrZak> whats wrong with opening the VPN and simply logging on?
[10:58:28] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> It won’t be open to the web. It’s currently locked down behind the VPN.
[10:58:40] <DrZak> yea, that is a good thing
[10:59:15] <DrZak> you almost never have rdp directly exposed to the internet
[10:59:16] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> The problem is, I have an allotted set of “public” IP’s to use in a block, and we’re hiring a lot of new people who require VM’s
[10:59:42] <DrZak> VMs? RDP?
[10:59:48] <DrZak> what does one got to do with another
[11:00:04] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> since the only route to these is through Parent CO’s VPN and they have no visibility to my internal network
[11:00:30] <xe0n> what is your end result wanting to be? you've got a bunch of public IP addresses you want to SNAT to specific machines?
[11:01:50] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> I think I just need to sleep on this and figure out something, but basic thing is: I need the ability to point all users to one IP, and allow them to access their specific machine without having DNS available
[11:02:32] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> the environment makes no sense in conventional ways
[11:02:35] <DrZak> and i assume those users sit behind dynamic ip addresses all over the internet?
[11:02:52] <DrZak> and they dont have a vpn client, coz they are some manner of external workers
[11:03:21] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> They have a VPN, but that gets them to parent company network, not mine
[11:03:36] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> Technically my network is external to the parent company
[11:03:48] <DrZak> in that case you need to have your network people set NATing from parnetnetwork to yournetwork
[11:04:36] <DrZak> basically tell em to reserve, dunno a B subnet and write the table in their firewall, set up proper routes
[11:04:37] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> Yeah. We do that now. I am running out of addresses to allow for one to one connections from parent Co to user VM’s.
[11:04:39] <DrZak> and that's that
[11:05:02] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> that can’t happen for compliance reasons.
[11:05:04] <DrZak> public ip addresses do not come into play ther eever
[11:05:23] <DrZak> well in that case deploy one RDP server

[11:05:38] <DrZak> and the monkeys can connect to that rdp server as a jump sever, and then from there to other servers
[11:06:29] <DrZak> 1 IP in the parent network is NATed to 1 IP of the RDP jump server in your own network
[11:06:34] <nobyk> Or computers, which is what this smells like
[11:06:43] <DrZak> and they connect to services inside your own network using your own dns
[11:06:50] <xe0n> rds gateway and web portal would work
[11:08:55] <DrZak> well, depends on the use ase, but its all about accessing X machines from one spot, and you have a list of them

[11:45:40] <DrZak> there's always somebody lying!

[16:11:15] <nobyk> just uhh, putting this in here
[16:12:28] <DrZak> its a complicated system these days
[16:12:36] <DrZak> errors like this are bound to happen
[16:12:46] <DrZak> definitely less horible than data leaks
[16:13:14] <nobyk> yah
[16:13:29] <nobyk> I wonder when shit hits the fan like that, how many people are actually working to fix it
[16:13:40] <nobyk> 3,5,45 people?
[16:13:53] <nobyk> Just the most senior guy maybe?
[16:14:28] <DrZak> i guess 3-5 ppl find the problem and make a repair plan and then dozens implement it
[16:14:40] <estranger> nobyk ahh damn

[16:16:27] <estranger> where did you see it's scrubbed?
[16:16:36] <nobyk> Google
[16:17:37] <nobyk> although it was of several hours ago, so maybe by now, they are doing it today
[16:17:55] <nobyk> but the stream still said it was scrubbed so I guess it'll still be a while
[16:18:03] <DrZak> tbh. i am feeling this whole web business grew out of control
[16:18:11] <nobyk> really

[16:18:21] <nobyk> What makes you feel that
[16:18:26] <estranger> the lift window just opened, haven't seen it scrubbed yet, but I'm not watching any streams
[16:18:28] <DrZak> REST helped make it more 'application' like
[16:18:28] <bagpuss_thecat> the web is overrated
[16:18:40] <DrZak> but still, so many errors, bloatiness, ugly hacks
[16:18:45] <DrZak> its just so untidy
[16:18:46] <estranger> yeh that was yesterday
[16:18:55] <estranger> think today is still a go
[16:19:01] <bagpuss_thecat> so it was
[16:19:40] <nobyk> when they have done the stack, is it then done and secure should wind woosh increase again?
[16:20:02] <estranger> it will be secured once it's stacked
[16:20:39] <estranger> lining it all up the first time they prob want it not windy
[16:20:59] <estranger> once it's attached and secured to the launch tower should be fine
[16:21:12] <estranger> now we just need faa clearance...
[16:21:37] <bagpuss_thecat> Bob will be in place to hold the rope tight and keep it secure

[17:28:57] <vinrock> creepy af
[17:29:11] <JollyRgrs> not hotdog?
[17:29:19] <vinrock> don't diddle kiddos
[17:29:23] <vinrock> also dont look at my photos
[17:29:39] <vinrock> they dont have to be exclusive
[17:29:52] <AnonymooseReddtr>  eh
[17:30:00] <PublicWiFi> vinrock: right
[17:30:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> they are using file hashes searching for known file hash imagery
[17:30:13] <JollyRgrs> so.... i was just about to ask if they were using file hashes of the known ones
[17:30:19] <vinrock> idk sounded to me like they were gona lok for personal diddlyporn
[17:30:20] <PublicWiFi> AnonymooseReddtr: that's way less intrusive
[17:30:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> exactly
[17:30:26] <vinrock> so new stuff
[17:30:28] <JollyRgrs> file hashes is totes not a big deal at all
[17:30:29] <PublicWiFi> AnonymooseReddtr: but i already got my pitch fork out....
[17:30:32] <PublicWiFi> :(
[17:30:33] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol 
[17:30:33] <vinrock> yeah hashes aint bad at all
[17:30:39] <PublicWiFi> yeah its not
[17:30:48] <PublicWiFi> like a legally sumbitted photo of abuse to police can be hashed and matched?
[17:30:49] <vinrock> but if they start actually analyzing photos this opens the door
[17:30:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> law enforcement has a database of known hashed files
[17:30:59] <PublicWiFi> it would have to be the exact same file, what are the odds of even finding anythin I waonder
[17:30:59] <vinrock> next thing theyre scanning photos for police warrants to find fugitives
[17:31:10] <PublicWiFi> even 1 pixel change would render that useless
[17:31:13] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: VERY HIGH
[17:31:18] <vinrock> didnt pay your child support?  found you at the beach on bob's iphone gotcha

[17:31:45] <PublicWiFi> that's true lol
[17:31:58] <JollyRgrs> and not just mobile phone

[17:32:24] <vinrock> we call that a know-it-all
[17:32:31] <PublicWiFi> dude was a fucking tool man. 5 years later he gets raided by FBI for downoading HELLA CP
[17:32:36] <vinrock> rekt
[17:32:37] <PublicWiFi> downloaded it straight from FBI lol
[17:32:43] <vinrock> well
[17:32:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> rofl
[17:32:47] <PublicWiFi> dude had like 1000+ photo stash or something, just disgusting
[17:32:50] <vinrock> fbi shouldnt be serving up cp either

[17:34:40] <PublicWiFi> both are wrong imo
[17:34:56] <JollyRgrs> they are using already known files that are circulating anyways... but at least they can catch whoever grabs these
[17:35:03] <PublicWiFi> my brother in law accidentlly downloaded some CP on limewire in like 2007
[17:35:04] <JollyRgrs> so... do 2 wrongs make a right?
[17:35:10] <PublicWiFi> it was an FBI file
[17:35:27] <PublicWiFi> and because limewire was set to upload and serve, they got him with distribution
[17:35:32] <PublicWiFi> really fucked up situation he was like 18
[17:35:36] <JollyRgrs> oh geez
[17:35:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> ouch
[17:35:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> got charged?

[17:36:21] <PublicWiFi> they do NOT fuck around
[17:36:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> sounds like there was a little more than just accidentally download an image 
[17:36:41] <PublicWiFi> hes back in KY now and unfortunately in KY you offender status doesn't expire
[17:36:54] <PublicWiFi> AnonymooseReddtr: Thats what i told my wife but thats his story and hes sticking to it lol
[17:37:14] <PublicWiFi> he can move to other states for 7-8 years to get it dropped I think
[17:37:23] <PublicWiFi> anyways, its all grey area haha
[17:37:43] <PublicWiFi> imagine being the agent having to upload CP to sting people, it would feel so wrong 
[17:38:05] <vinrock> i remmeber there being something about limewire/kazaa/bearshare that cp duders were able to use peoples machines to distribute cp without them knowing
[17:38:11] <vinrock> this was a thing in the news back in the day
[17:38:22] <PublicWiFi> the thing that makes me nervous about the apple thing is
[17:38:28] <PublicWiFi> imagine someone having CP planted on their phone
[17:38:47] <PublicWiFi> or their icloud account
[17:39:15] <PublicWiFi> idk, just this seems like a sixith amendment grey area, like traffic cameras
[17:39:32] <PublicWiFi> do you have a right to your accuser if its a computer or AI?
[17:39:39] <PublicWiFi> anyways time to work! :D
[17:39:58] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: but the accuser is not the computer/AI
[17:40:18] <JollyRgrs> that's just the tool used BY non-lawn enforcement... to alert law enforcement

[17:49:30] <teh_f4ll3n> patient 0
[17:49:34] <corn266> i'll inject your mother
[17:49:45] <teh_f4ll3n> corn266, try cryptic1's
[17:49:45] <JollyRgrs> teh_f4ll3n: don't think it works that way
[17:49:47] <JollyRgrs> :P
[17:50:22] <corn266> cryptic1's mom's queue is so backed up it'll start another pandemic
[17:50:42] <zetorian> JollyRgrs: just you wait, once we get brain implants some jackass'll find a way to spread it
[17:50:42] <JollyRgrs> ... how does that work?
[17:51:07] <corn266> by the time i get to her covid will be over
[17:51:07] <JollyRgrs> just make it into a tik tok
[17:52:04] <JollyRgrs> that is a bit better than "it'll start another pandemic"
[17:52:25] <corn266> yea but there are other implications
[17:52:49] <corn266> ie. i have a disease (some kind of SQL injection) that'll start another pandemic
[17:53:12] <JollyRgrs> that's not implied
[17:53:28] <corn266> is it not?
[17:54:14] <JollyRgrs> the joke would have to be "i have a pandemic starting disease and when i get to cryptic1's mom, it will take so long that covid-19 will be over, but I will start a new one b/c I will infect her with my disease"... which turns out to be a terrible joke
[17:54:52] <teh_f4ll3n> guys, you're overthinking stuff
[17:54:54] <PublicWiFi> im too tired to try to read this
[17:54:56] <PublicWiFi> lol
[17:54:59] <corn266> so, the funny part is the amount of effort you have to put in to figuring it out
[17:55:15] <JollyRgrs> teh_f4ll3n: no, i'm just trying to pass another 5 minutes until this stupid meeting starts up
[17:55:18] <corn266> and in the context of the current conversation it's implied that it would be an SQL injection
[17:55:47] <JollyRgrs> not really corn266, again that isn't implied and not how that would work anyways
[17:55:50] <zetorian> I need more coffee if yall are gonna be like this

[17:56:00] *** Joins: oj (~oj@user/oj)
[17:56:09] <corn266> so, because the outcome of the joke is so stupid / terrible, but you had to think so much to get to it, it becomes funny
[17:56:16] <corn266> because i wasted your time and you realized that
[17:57:03] <teh_f4ll3n> cryptic1's mom is a metaphysical being capable of "multi-threading" ie. servicing every one at the same time
[17:57:31] <corn266> she's a 3-core with 2 threads per core

[18:31:31] <PubicWiFi> i think i might try to implement it here but im worried about the fact that there's no way to reset user's master passwords haha
[18:31:38] <bagpuss_thecat> 'in prod' in that I trust my life to it... yeah
[18:31:51] <PubicWiFi> cause ive got some dumdums who would probably do that and lose 100 passwords
[18:32:26] <PubicWiFi> i know that the ability to reset passwords means storing keys on the server aka less secure

[22:38:50] <shakygator> cloud is cheating, honestly
[22:39:06] <shakygator> its too easy, now devs think they dont need ops
[22:39:20] <iphone> they often dont
[22:40:03] <shakygator> i disagree
[22:40:10] <iphone> you love to do that
[22:40:16] <shakygator> they always manage to need something new they dont understand
[22:41:22] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> yeah my experience thus far with devs that think they can do their own ops is they make bad decisions
[22:41:29] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> you need to understand the underlying infrastructure
[22:41:54] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> IaC isn't enough; if you're just kicking off Terraform but you don't understand what it is doing you are jacking off
[22:42:23] <iphone> webhosting platforms exist. pantheon.io and platform.sh come to mind
[22:42:35] <shakygator> godaddy exists too
[22:42:38] <iphone> they all provide integration with caches, databases, email
[22:42:39] <shakygator> look where that got us
[22:43:10] <iphone> We have lots of clients on pantheon.io. Very manageable for devs to do the work. Ops just does it quicker.
[22:43:27] <shakygator> aws you can go default VPC and click all the things to create elasticcache, rds instances and ses but doesnt mean they know what theyre doing
[22:43:58] <iphone> same goes for ops. No guarantee that your ops team is competant
[22:44:09] <shakygator> well thats why i am interviewing people to make sure they are eh
[22:44:34] <iphone> good devops teams are full of linux nerds and have some experience in ops. There is a huge overlap between dev and ops
[22:44:54] <corn266> you could almost say its.... devops
[22:45:01] <shakygator> i expect my ops team to be competent in infra technologies (server technologies, containers, k8s, networking)
[22:45:06] <shakygator> i dont expect my dev team to know these things
[22:45:26] <oxipital> intresting my employer just implemented a punishment for not wearing a mask outside
[22:45:36] <oxipital> 1st strike: 1 day suspension without pay
[22:45:42] <oxipital> uh cool/
[22:46:08] <iphone> I'd expect a good dev to understand containers and basic networking, and a low level understanding of kubernetes if that's the stack you're working on
[22:46:16] <iphone> oxipital: thats crazy
[22:46:28] <shakygator> general understanding yes, they need to be able to write docker files
[22:46:32] <oxipital> so bad ass
[22:46:38] <oxipital> even i can write docker files
[22:46:51] <shakygator> i can too, does that make me a dev now?
[22:46:59] <oxipital> and im like not devops or borderline normal intelligent
[22:47:50] <shakygator> super retros are super suck
[22:48:05] <iphone> if your devs fingerpaint with PHP, then you can't expect them to excel in infra. But there is a market of devs with infrastructure experience. Lots of them are very capable of doing dev work and infra work
[22:48:08] <shakygator> oh looks like the interns are leaving
[22:48:36] <shakygator> well yeah of course there are outliers and people do get exposure to other things. im not a java dev but i have to dig through java crap all the time
[22:48:57] <iphone> but those same finger-painting devs can still use pantheon.io and platform.sh. You just can't run super complex stacks on those sites
[22:49:25] <shakygator> yeah its like a web site hosting on godaddy or what was that other free one
[22:49:29] <shakygator> wix
[22:49:30] <oxipital> like leaving leaving?
[22:49:39] <shakygator> well summer is over

[22:49:58] <oxipital> and did you haze them?
[22:49:58] <shakygator> yeah they were okay
[22:50:09] <shakygator> nah they were dev interns so i just stood up some things for em
[22:50:32] <shakygator> and answered questions about why an internal k8s service hostname wouldnt work from their local
