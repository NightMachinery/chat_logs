[04:54:04] <justacec[m]> I am trying to use the companion app on MacOS and having major issues with the window GUI freezing and turning black when I want to resize it.  I have reviewed the issue online and saw that there was a maximum size issue, so I scaled the window way down (to the point of unusable) and still had the issue, even after a restart.  I have Qt5 installed via home-brew and have installed the most recent gnuradio from GIT as of last night (Master
[04:54:04] <justacec[m]> branch).    Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?  Are there good env variables?  Should I switch to Qt6 (I don't think that gr-qtgui supports Qt6).  Any help would be beyond awesome.  :). [I am on MacOS 12.3]

[13:51:07] <justacec[m]> Now, I still can right click, the screen just goes either black or does not update, but I can get context menus to pop up.
[13:59:59] <justacec[m]> Ahh, so based on Derek Kozel 's question, I re-installed the gr-lora package so the two connected blocks which were missing were then ok.  Now it seems to be behave much better.
[14:00:37] <DerekKozel[m]> huh?!
[14:00:57] <DerekKozel[m]> It behaves ok when all connected blocks are present, but not when blocks are missing and connected?
[14:01:28] <DerekKozel[m]> That's a new behaviour if so! I've seen crashes when even just two built in blocks are connected.
[14:02:42] <justacec[m]> Well, will need to keep watching it, but the black flickering is gone now. 
[14:03:07] <justacec[m]> Now, all I had were two blocks in the app, both of which were missing.
[14:16:23] <DerekKozel[m]> Unfortunately there are still very few people both using GNU Radio on Mac OS and able to dig through the code to find the cause of these variety of graphical issues. Please do report anything you find on the GitHub tracker so there's a record at least and there's a better chance of finding it.

[15:21:55] <justacec[m]> So confusing.  Code states: "# Note: gr-qtgui requires Qt5." in the CMake conf files for the module.  So, it is failing to find my QT6 as good enough.  
[15:22:56] <justacec[m]> I will just build against Qt5
[15:36:43] <Ignas[m]> where can I read about how downsampling works within gnu radio? like 10M sample rate radio in 44.1 audio out, or 10M sample rate radio in and decode OOK stream out
[15:37:22] <Ignas[m]> I've seen people convert vectors to OOK radio by "repeating" vector elements, but I suspect there might be a more fundamental way of doing it
[15:38:00] <Ignas[m]> like - telling that "interpret this vector as a stream at 1 element per second" and then "upsample it to 1000 elements per second"
[15:40:30] <Ignas[m]> ok, so seems like the words I am looking for are "decimation" and "interpolation", though I am not sure
