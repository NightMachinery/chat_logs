[00:04:03] <ke4nhw> Yep I've got that open and I downloaded the source to view that text file it mentions. So far I am seeing nothing on what I need to do as far as creating a socket and pw-file for the management socket-name unix [pw-file] directive it lists as being recommended.

[00:58:55] <ke4nhw> Anyone got a link to docs on how to set things up to use the 'management socket-name unix [pw-file]' options? I honestly do not know anything about setting a unix socket, binding to the management interface, and the pw-file (do I create one?) so any docs/help in this regard would be great.

[01:23:04] <ke4nhw> Is the creation and naming of the unix socket something done manually in the OS itself or will OpenVPN create a unix socket with the name I provide for 'socket-name'? And the pw-file, how and where do I create this file, or will OpenVPN also create this? And tell me it's not a plaintext file. I am looking in the documentation and I'm not seeing any info/examples of how to accomplish these 
[01:23:04] <ke4nhw> tasks.
[01:30:54] <Pippin_> management /etc/openvpn/server1.sock unix
[01:37:35] <ke4nhw> Okay so it'll create the socket itself then?
[01:38:20] <ke4nhw> btw thank you Pippin_ I really appreciate the help... 
[01:40:20] <ke4nhw> Pippin_: as for the [pw-file], how is that done? I'm also not seeing much about that in the docs.
[01:41:40] <Pippin_> just try it
[01:47:55] <ke4nhw> Okay got that and log shows the socket loaded. Now how to connect to the socket? 
[01:55:57] <Pippin_> have netcat?
[01:56:53] <ke4nhw> not yet but I can dnf it... It's also showing socat on the search and nmap-natcat (similar)... grab all 3?
[01:57:22] <ke4nhw> nmap-ncat is the 3rd
[01:57:30] <ke4nhw> grab em all?
[01:58:23] <Pippin_> try: socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/etc/openvpn/server1.sock
[01:58:51] <ke4nhw> command not found, lemme grab it as well
[01:59:22] <Pippin_> or: nc -w 20 -U /etc/openvpn/server1.sock
[02:01:03] <Pippin_> or: telnet /etc/openvpn/server1.sock unix
[02:01:23] <ke4nhw> used the socat, I'm in :) now the last thing to figure out is the [pw-file]. It is recommended in the man pages, but kinda vague on how to set it up (the way it reads it almost sounds like a plain text file.
[02:01:44] <Pippin_> yup
[02:02:07] <Pippin_> i guess one line containing the pw
[02:02:18] <ke4nhw> the telnet one failed with 'telnet: unix: bad port
[02:02:36] <Pippin_> just guessing :)
[02:03:45] <ke4nhw> who should the file be owned by and what are the minimum permissions (plaintext passwords kinda make me cringe... Just want the file accessible with least permissions by the specific user:group needed.
[02:05:17] <ke4nhw> not complaining as the socat worked, but why is the telnet failing with bad port?
[02:05:22] <Pippin_> openvpn only needs read access afaik
[02:06:36] <Pippin_> idk...
[02:07:07] <Tuvix> See --management-client-user and --management-client-group in the manpage as well. Security-conscious users don't exposed unix domain sockets to an overly permissive set of users
[02:07:47] <Tuvix> As to telnet, check your implementation (ie: its manpage) for how to specify a socket. I'd hope this obvious, but socat and telnet do not use the same arguments or specification of ports vs. sockets.
[02:09:47] <ke4nhw> I did see the management-client-user and that caught my eye. I just specify that directive in the config file right after the management /etc/openvpn/server1.sock unix line, and does that go on system users?
[02:22:25] <ke4nhw> Okay beautiful, I'm still looking into the telnet command to see how to specify a socket, but socat is working. management-clent-user does good, I can only sign in with a specific user, and to sign in as that user requires a password (which is not plain text lol) so I may or may not use the [pw-file] argument.
[02:31:42] <ke4nhw> Okay I have one last question: with this setup, does this mean that the socket is not accessible from a remote machine (I can't just use socat and point to this machine and socket regardless of firewall settings) directly, rather I would be required to ssh into the server and access it that way? If so, then I'm gonna call it set.
[02:51:51] <ke4nhw> Pippin_: And thank you for helping me with this and getting this configured more safely. I really do appreciate your assistance. 
[02:55:10] <Pippin_> yw
[02:56:44] <ke4nhw> Oh and am I right that the socket isn't accessible remotely except by accessing the server with ssh and accessing it from that terminal?
[03:10:38] <Tuvix> Unix sockets are local-only, although recent OpenSSHd implementations _can_ forward sockets just like TCP ports over the connection
[03:17:47] <ke4nhw> Hmm, I don't think that would be beneficial to me, I will just ssh in and do what I need to do from there.
[03:18:06] <ke4nhw> But that's good to know, something to keep in mind for the future
[03:18:22] <ke4nhw> Thank you Tuvix
