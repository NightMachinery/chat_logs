[19:53:02] <gtlsgamr> I think the wording should be changed slightly. Not no offtopic.. but move off topic spam to PMs

[19:53:14] <Arya[m]123> thats what i was saying
[19:53:33] <gtlsgamr> And Honestly, IRC is a different platform. I own the IRC and it is up to me to enforce those rules on this end.

[20:26:09] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]:

[20:32:15] <Arya[m]123> no
[20:32:25] <Arya[m]123> we can go off topic like we normally do
[20:32:37] <Arya[m]123> unless it spirals out of control and one of the admins asks them to stop
