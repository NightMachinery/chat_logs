[00:14:03] <Rockwood> yes it is

[00:14:34] <cbreak>  git push Cyberiaaxis master // this is what it says there

[00:15:27] <Rockwood> hows?

[05:03:17] <Jong> Hello. I made a mistake in my branch, but already merged it to main. I need to change just one line of code. What do I do?
[05:03:39] *** Quits: causa_sui (~causasui@c-68-60-125-136.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:03:57] <Jong> maybe I can amend force push the merge commit and no one will notice?
[05:03:58] <mackerman> Jong: commit and push a commit
[05:04:33] <Jong> commit and push a commit in main, or my branch?
[05:04:35] <mackerman> No, don't change history when you shouldn't
[05:05:25] <mackerman> Follow your typical process. Probably fix in some other branch, then merge to main
[05:05:38] <Jong> The change is changing pathlib.Path(__file__).parents[2].resolve() / "param/train/comms/pt/comms.py"
[05:05:40] <Jong> to pathlib.Path(__file__).absolute().parents[3].resolve() / "param/train/comms/pt/comms.py"
[05:06:14] <Jong> what would you write as the commit message? I screwed up how many parents up I needed to go.  That's the mistake. But I'm also adding absolute() so the commend works irrespective of cwd
[05:06:44] <mackerman> Follow your usual procedure for messages.
[05:07:12] <Jong> hmm team doesn't have set rules.
[05:08:12] *** Quits: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:08:13] <Jong> "fix comms.py path. Make the path cwd agnostic."
[05:08:17] <Jong> how does that sound?
[05:08:45] <mackerman> First sentance is the subject.   Body includes the second.
[05:08:51] <mackerman> Sure that works.
[05:09:12] <Jong> actually I'll switch it around so "fix" isn't drawing attention hehe
[05:09:34] *** Quits: pah_ (~pah@host-95-248-130-153.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:10:21] <mackerman> Fix is a common verb in the imperative mood, works fine
[05:10:47] <Jong> "Make comms.py path cwd agnostic. Fix number of parents to traverse"
[05:11:05] *** Joins: ash_worksi (~ash_m@user/ash-m/x-3292451)
[05:11:28] <Jong> hmm do we "traverse" when we change directories to the parent directory in a loop?
[05:12:01] *** Joins: pah (~pah@user/pah)
[05:18:13] <mackerman> I wouldn't call most of what pathlib does traversing
[05:19:52] <mackerman> While writing careful commit messages is good, this probaby is overthinking it for a one line fix with possibly a one line message.

[13:32:45] <dminuoso> subtree merging appears to be sort of non-submodule submodules solution

[20:43:40] <dminuoso> elibrokeit: Some people believe that rewriting history is a bad idea precisely because it's rewriting history
[20:43:57] <dminuoso> You change from recording what happened to some pretesnse.
[20:44:23] <[twisti]> which makes sense for public history, but not really for private history imo
[20:44:32] <dminuoso> It's the question of whether you want your commit history to be a reflection of intend or actuality.
[20:44:38] <[twisti]> brains dont generally work in a way where sequential recording ofthe process makes sense
[20:44:39] <dminuoso> [twisti]: I think it's personal preference.
[20:44:50] <dminuoso> Neither seems to be necessarily the right approach, both have their merit.
[20:44:57] <dminuoso> I dont like rebasing even for internal
[20:45:07] <[twisti]> you wouldnt expect an author to write a book start to finish in order, yet its obvious that reading it in order is probably the best experience
[20:45:16] <dminuoso> If your rebase to "provide a cleaner commit history", perhaps you should develop more discipline in your work chunking and committing.
[20:45:36] <dminuoso> [twisti]: And you wouldn't expect a ledger author to rewrite the ledger after the fact.
[20:46:17] <[twisti]> that, im sorry, but to me that is terrible advice - 'constrict your work and hinder your workflow in order to avoid a tool specifically made for what you would use it for'
[20:46:18] <dviola> [twisti]: then I probably failed to communicate properly, let me try again: I think there's nothing wrong with rebasing, but the other day I experienced some frustration when I pushed my repo to a remote server, and a coworker squashed all my commits and undo'ed my work.
[20:46:41] <[twisti]> its like suggestign your programmers write their code with a pen on paper because its more pure than a text editor where you can change lines
[20:47:07] <dminuoso> I dont think making poor analogies is helpful.
[20:47:14] <[twisti]> dviola: that sounds more like your coworker made a mistake, not a systemic problem with either rebasing or squashing
[20:47:36] <dviola> [twisti]: I'm not blaming rebase or squash, probably just some issue with our communication, yes, I agree

[20:49:35] <dminuoso> Well I guess there is git-revert
[20:53:01] <elibrokeit> dviola: okay, seems like squash is a problem whether you rebase or not ;)
[20:53:38] <elibrokeit> dminuoso: I view private commits as a series of proposed patch files eventually imported into a public branch, so rebasing is not only fair game but expected and desired.
