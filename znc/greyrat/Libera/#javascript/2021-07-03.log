[00:12:53] <ross> ljharb: the X is that I have a highly nested dataset with duplicated information. e.g. some nodes in my data structure have 'tags' (which is an array of strings), and there is also an object defining what tags are permitted. I'd like to be able to easily propagate changes to those definitions without having to search through the tree and potentially create conflicts and stuff
[00:13:13] <earendel> you  are right. words are walking sticlks. plant them they will grow. watch they waving ho ho ho
[00:13:32] <ross> ljharb: the Y is that with a RDBMS and a proper table setup I'd be able to change 1 data point in 1 place and have it reflect everywhere, but an actual RDBMS e.g. sqlite would be overkill

[00:13:44] <ljharb> ross: why would it be overkill if you have the exact problem it solves
[00:14:39] <ross> ljharb: because I don't necessarily want to bundle a full database into my application, or go to the trouble of interfacing with dbs on the filesystem when a js in-memory solution would suffice

[00:15:30] <ljharb> ross: all you'll end up doing is reimplementing a database in JS, badly
[00:15:32] <wroathe> ross: sqlite isn't a full RDBMS, and by default operates in memory

[00:16:49] <ross> wroathe: noted, but would that result in a highly bloated application? or is sqlite even smaller than I think?
[00:16:50] <wroathe> GinFuyou: No need to pop. Just use .each
[00:17:00] <wroathe> ross: sqlite is very tiny
[00:17:03] <ljharb> ross: because you have duplicated data in your structure, which an RDBMS solves, and you want to be able to update a single source of truth, which an RDBMS solves
[00:17:28] <ljharb> ross: sqlite will always be tinier than any JS app designed to emulate it
[00:17:46] <ross> that's reassuring to know re sqlite
[00:18:00] <ross> I should have no qualms about bundling it then. thanks both for the advice!
[00:18:37] <GinFuyou> wroathe, i don't see how I would use each. I want to submit next when success callback of previous ajax submit is run.
[00:19:20] <wroathe> GinFuyou: Oh, you didn't mention AJAX, or the need to wait. If the goal was just to submit the forms in a sequence you could just simply use .submit() on the selected collection
[00:19:27] <GreenJello> GinFuyou, the easiest way is probably async/await, but depends on target browser support

[00:20:40] <wroathe> GreenJello: But fair enough
[00:21:10] <GinFuyou> Well that what I meant by sequentially, I don't need JS to submit all at once
[00:21:23] <ljharb> yes but all JS ceases the instant you normal-submit a form
[00:21:34] <GreenJello> with async/await you can loop over them and await the AJAX request
[00:21:42] <GinFuyou> Now I just set timeout with each, but it's not efficient since time can vary greatly
[00:21:52] <ljharb> GinFuyou: use promises, not setTimeout

[00:22:40] <jellobot> GinFuyou, Promises are placeholders for values that'll be provided in the future. They allow composing asynchronous operations like synchronous ones. See http://robotlolita.me/2015/11/15/how-do-promises-work.html and https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/. Contrast with !cps & see https://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/.

[00:50:42] <ljharb> lmat: but really, don't put JS in html
[00:50:49] <ljharb> !onfoo @ lmat
[00:50:49] <jellobot> lmat, Using ".onclick", ".onchange", or "on" anything is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code; as well as limiting you to one event listener per event. Consider attaching your events with addEventListener, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[00:50:58] <ljharb> oh wait
[00:51:01] <ljharb> !inline @ lmat
[00:51:01] <jellobot> lmat, Inline event handlers are essentially `eval` inside HTML markup - they're bad practice and result in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Seriously consider attaching your events with JavaScript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[00:51:54] <lmat> ljharb: So you expect this to work?
[00:51:58] <lmat> I mean, at least call my function?
[00:52:55] <GreenJello> no, your event handler creates a function and does nothing with it
[00:53:15] <GreenJello> it's as useful as onclick="7"
[00:53:51] <ljharb> lmat: there's a number of reasons why it won't work. ^ is one
[00:53:52] <lmat> GreenJello: is   onclick="myFunc" any better? or   onclick="myFunc()"  ?  I've tried all of them and they don't work.

[00:54:45] <ljharb> lmat: don't put anything like that in the html tho
[00:54:49] <ljharb> lmat: use JS to add your event handlers
[00:55:09] <lmat> Yeah, I guess I can't get to the event object this way :(
[00:55:52] <GreenJello> there's a global 'event' variable for inline event handlers to use, but that's kinda gross
[00:56:24] <GreenJello> it's also bug-prone if you do anything async inside the event handler
[00:57:25] <banana_> freedom!
[00:58:37] <banana_> like a snail changing shells, instead of the royal crest shell it's the burger king logo.
[00:58:56] <banana_> sorry anyway
[01:00:07] <lmat> GreenJello: Oh, thanks!
[01:00:29] <banana_> yeah addEventListener is also awesome because it matters the order of running that method. if you ever need that granularity

[03:39:36] <farn> The section on context menus isn't in the spec anymore but it looks like the described behavior is still in Firefox
[03:39:58] <entuland> it only gets in the way of regular users and won't stop anyone that really wants to access whatever they want the context menu for

[03:50:25] <entuland> in firefox seems like you can prevent the appearance of the default context menu by alt-right-clicking, according to this question on the mozilla website: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1290242
[03:50:34] <entuland> the question is fairly fresh (last year)
[03:50:41] <entuland> I don't have Firefox installed to test it out

[03:53:25] <entuland> on google's spreadsheets on chrome I get the custom context menu with the right click and the default context menu with shift right click
[03:53:35] <nedbat> i wasn't trying to hide things, i just wanted to use the gesture for my own uses
[03:54:27] <entuland> yep, I got that from fern's remark above, it's all good if you just want to have your own custom context menu

[06:44:18] <austincheney> I am trying to figure out the webdriver api.  I can launch chrome with flag --remote-debuggin-port=9000 which launches a localhost webserver in the browser on port 9000, but when I attempt to send a client request from a node application I get no response.  Any idea?
[06:44:40] <austincheney> I can verify the webserver is there by going to http://localhost:9000/ in the browser address bar

[07:10:48] <wroathe> They must have changed it.
[07:11:14] <austincheney> you need an external binary to perform the webdriver api to cdp translation and as a security stop gap so that the browser does not expose itself to remote control without that external binary locallaly available

[11:09:03] <theskillwithin> im not sure tho
[11:11:46] <sumthing1980> I think that replaces the urlbar without loading a new page
[11:13:22] <theskillwithin> ahh looks like ur right
[11:13:44] <sumthing1980> assign works tho but you cant use  back button
[11:15:04] <theskillwithin> i tried assign just now, it keeps the history and lets you use the back button
[11:15:12] <sumthing1980> window.location.href is supposed to allow back button but how can I use it
[11:15:49] <sumthing1980> https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_redirect_webpage.asp
[11:15:55] <theskillwithin> window.location.href = 'https://wtver.com'
[11:16:33] <theskillwithin> i tried assign just now tho, it seems to keep thie back button
[11:16:53] <sumthing1980> I use brave
[11:17:14] <theskillwithin> i tried in chrome, in console to be quick.  which should be the same as brave
[11:18:51] <theskillwithin> i tried in brave console just now.    window.location.href = 'test'   seems to behave the same to me as window.location.assign('test')
[11:19:15] <sumthing1980> weird
[11:19:38] <theskillwithin> both give me a back button
[11:19:43] <theskillwithin> to the prev place i was at
[11:20:08] <sumthing1980> does it allow back to the page which has the .assign code?

[11:21:26] <sumthing1980> the code window.location.assign on page 1 sends you to page 2 can you click back and go back to page 1
[11:21:37] <theskillwithin> if i go to google.com,  open console, then do location.assign('test')    then do location.assign('testtesttest').  i hit back button it takes me back to /test  and if i hit it again it takes me back to google.com

[11:49:15] <sumthing1980> when you click back button on firefox and brave it goes to the page with the form
[11:49:15] <earendel> never used assign .. couple of years ago it was common practise to reflect more restlessly on client state change via updates in the location.hash (which also allowed for history updates, without loading whole document)
[11:49:21] <sumthing1980> not the page with the redirection
[11:50:17] <sumthing1980> the code is currently <script>window.location.assign('url');</script>
[11:50:27] <sumthing1980> it works,
[11:50:42] <sumthing1980> you can instantaneously see it in brave, almost invisble in firefox

[13:36:30] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-ns7lg?file=/demo.js chk the footer's menu

[13:37:07] <Rockwood> dropdown list hope you understand my concern now
[13:37:14] <Rockwood> about menu
[13:37:15] <theskillwithin> ya don't do that in footer lol
[13:37:28] <Rockwood> lol
[13:37:37] <theskillwithin> dropdown in footer makes no sense
[13:37:38] <Rockwood> but i need there too
[13:37:50] <Rockwood> its gaming crazyness
[13:37:55] <theskillwithin> well if your doing manually,  make it drop up instead of down
[13:38:15] <Rockwood> hows is possible? by css or js?
[13:39:10] <theskillwithin> or a more complex solution is to detect with getBoundingClientRect to detect if it goes outside the viewport and choose a different direction it goes in based on that.... but i do not recommend this for you
[13:40:08] <Rockwood> css will be better option i think
[13:40:23] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/W5FWW/1/show/
[13:47:05] <theskillwithin> ugh so dumb do have a dropdown in the footer
[13:47:11] <theskillwithin> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-71590

[13:49:17] <Rockwood> thanks
[13:52:34] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, how to make them differs
[13:52:59] <Rockwood> i means footer menu and header menu css
[13:53:12] <Rockwood> all tags will be same
[13:53:42] <theskillwithin> have a different class on the footer than header that does it different
[13:54:39] <theskillwithin> think about it
[13:54:58] <theskillwithin> its just the css thats different, so do a different css class for footer that does it

[19:31:31] <entuland> is there any event that gets fired when a canvas loses its buffer due to having been resized or should I keep track of the dimensions and check them to decide whether to repaint the contents with, say, requestAnimationFrame()?
[19:31:39] <entuland> 2d context
[19:31:57] <qswz> I guess window resize event

[20:54:11] <Safa_[A_Boy]> But no, the css questions needs js
[20:54:44] <entuland> then you can simply have your js check the cookies and lazyload the resources as needed
[20:55:05] <entuland> is the question about how to exactly query the cookies or how to add the resources on the fly after the main HTML has been loaded?
[20:55:31] <samsch> Safa_[A_Boy], IMO you're just better off *not* following the advise for your base html. Dynamically serving your base html is just better.

[21:48:08] <rustyshackleford> I've used the http api and I was not a fan
[21:48:28] <GreenJello> wroathe, I bet it doesn't handle the cases I mentioned above

[21:49:21] *** Joins: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100)
[21:49:28] <GreenJello> you can write incorrect code easily with fetch, but it's relatively difficult to write good code, and without a unifying client, the error handling is maybe a bit too inconsistent for a dynamically typed language, unless you're very strict
[21:49:41] <wroathe> GreenJello: You just set the Accept header to application/json, and then check the content type in a .then before making the decision to body.json(), otherwise Promise.reject or throw

[21:51:14] <GreenJello> you also need to check the status, and to reject with an error containing the status and JSON response, or if not JSON, the error and the text response
[21:51:30] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[21:51:39] <GreenJello> and you need to take care when matching on the content-type response header, as it's a bit more involved than ===
[21:51:59] <GreenJello> which is easy to forget while trying to implement a feature
[21:52:22] <wroathe> GreenJello: I would prefer that it not reject based on status code, for the first point
[21:52:41] <wroathe> GreenJello: A non-200 status code isn't an exceptional situation, and should be handled by the caller as needed
[21:53:03] <GreenJello> sure, that's also valid
[21:53:28] <wroathe> GreenJello: And often times you have control over the response headers anyway (if it's your organization's server), and so it is as easy as === 'application/json'
[21:53:38] <GreenJello> but for a getJson kind of function, you usually expect the promise to resolve to the response body
[21:53:42] <wroathe> GreenJello: But you can certainly make that more robust, which would end up being yet another tiny function

[21:55:03] <GreenJello> yeah, that sounds like a good approach (re modifying response)
[21:55:13] <wroathe> GreenJello: Being sarcastic?
[21:55:17] <GreenJello> nope
[21:55:25] <GreenJello> I like the idea
[21:55:50] <GreenJello> but about content-type, the server explicitly saying it's utf8 shouldn't cause you to treat it like it's a non-json response
[21:56:02] <wroathe> GreenJello: I get why you'd potentially want something like axios, if you're coming from a jquery, for example, but I think modern Javascript now has the tools to make fetch a very pleasant experience, if you're willing to write small helpers
[21:56:24] <wroathe> GreenJello: Yeah, you would certainly account for that
[21:57:55] <johtso> Okay, I've made some progress. Worked out I was using an ancient version of xstate. I'm still finding that no events are getting triggered when my "FETCH" finishes.. https://codesandbox.io/s/competent-noyce-ij7yz?file=/src/index.ts
[21:58:14] <johtso> I'm probably doing something stupid.. but It's kind of hard to debug when something _doesn't_ happen
