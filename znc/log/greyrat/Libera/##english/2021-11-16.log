[03:04:09] <lpapp> hi, is "die" a typo in this context? Should it not be dice instead? https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/17-dynamic_programming/number_solitaire/
[03:06:59] <twb> “In modern standard English, the singular die (rather than dice) is uncommon. Dice is used for both the singular and the plural.”
[03:07:16] <twb> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dice#Usage_notes
[03:08:01] <lpapp> oh, okay, thanks, so not a typo, although not particularly helpful for clarity either.
[03:09:16] <LjL> it's helpful if you know the word
[03:09:24] <LjL> which is like... i disagree it's an uncommon word
[03:09:30] <LjL> i always just knew it as the singular of dice
[03:09:59] <LjL> not wanting to be a prescriptivist or anything but why would the somewhat-semi-quasi-commonly-accepted form of a word be "not helpful for clarity"
[03:10:34] <twb> reorder sentence to avoid debated form
[03:15:49] <LjL> not wanting to be a prescriptivist or anything but why would the form of a word which is somewhat accepted to a semi and quasi common degree be "not helpful for clarity"
[03:17:49] <lpapp> to be clear for foreigners?
[03:18:06] <lpapp> this is not written for native speakers, but for anyone in the world.
[03:18:10] <LjL> okay
[03:18:13] <LjL> i'm a "foreigner"
[03:18:21] <lpapp> And it is no surprise that 90% of the sites (if not more) use dice.
[03:18:22] <LjL> 1) why would it be clear to foreigners to use the "wrong" singular
[03:18:33] <lpapp> whatever
[03:18:34] <LjL> 2) and if it's because the word "die" also means something else
[03:18:50] <LjL>   a) how on earth is that different from the 1000000000 other homonyms english has
[03:19:03] <lpapp> you are just trolling
[03:19:04] <LjL>   b) how on earth could it be confused with the verb "die" in that context
[03:19:08] <lpapp> so, I will not get engaged.
[03:19:11] <LjL> cool
[03:19:14] <LjL> i could say the same of you
[03:19:52] <LjL> i mean you came here asking whether it was a typo WHILE understanding what it meant
[03:19:55] <LjL> so you understood it fine
[03:20:22] <LjL> and now you claim it's somehow the writer's fault anyway for using a perfectly correct and noncontroversial form. how is that NOT trolling

[13:47:52] <zaeph> eszett: I'm ESL, but I studied English linguistics for my degree; so, take what I'll say with a grain of salt.  “start” requires a gerund (what you called “-ing”) here because you're looking at the action as having a duration, as opposed to just being punctual.  In other words, you're elongating the “move him” phrase to have a duration.
[13:49:06] <zaeph> With “please help move him”, I would say that the locutor only see the phrase “move him” as a punctual event, i.e. without a duration to it.  This is mostly from an enunciative perspective, and different grammars account for them differently.
[13:49:29] <zaeph> Long story short: yes, for learners, it might be best to intuit it eventually by memorising those patterns first.

[17:19:57] <Me-me> In my context, "difference" is not something with can have less of, but something I can have fewer of. I was trying to delimit differences. And therefore I said that none of them sprang to mind, as opposed to "springs" to mind..

[20:33:10] <tolarz> If "Sec." can be used as an abbreviation for "Section", what can I use to abbreviate "Sections"?
[20:34:18] <zaeph> tolarz: Is it vital to differentiate the plural here?  Generally, abbreviating a word does free you from the need to pluralise it properly.
[20:34:45] <tolarz> idk
[20:34:55] <tolarz> I just want to cite a range of sections from somewhere.
[20:36:19] <zaeph> Then “Sec.” would seem appropriate to me.
