[14:57:18] <luc4> Hello! I'm using a crate to plot some data from Rust in gnuplot. It seems however that my plot disappears when I resize the window. Any idea why this may be happening? My understanding is that gnuplot should replot the same data, why should it disappear?

[19:38:48] <mnhrdt> luc4: how do you call gnuplot?
[20:57:08] <luc4> mnhrdt: I'm digging into the code of the crate: https://github.com/SiegeLord/RustGnuplot/blob/master/gnuplot/src/figure.rs. It seems it is called with the persistent option https://github.com/SiegeLord/RustGnuplot/blob/master/gnuplot/src/figure.rs#L378
[20:58:02] <luc4> mnhrdt: I noticed that the problem is only present when I place two plots in the figure, and the only one affected is the one in position 0.
[20:58:43] <luc4> mnhrdt: the one in position 1 is replotted properly
[21:56:40] <mnhrdt> luc4: can you post the gnuplot code standalone
[21:57:17] <mnhrdt> (i cannot run rust code)
[21:58:20] <mnhrdt> luc4: you can also try to use different terminals, and see if this is terminal-specific
[22:00:14] <mnhrdt> for example "set term x11" or "set term wxt"
[22:00:43] <mnhrdt> in my case they behave differently
[22:01:01] <mnhrdt> (regarding resizing the window)
