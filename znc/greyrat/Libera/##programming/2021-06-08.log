[03:53:44] <Rounin> kek_: I wonder if the index.html thing is actually a redirect performed by the server, and not by the browser
[03:53:56] <Rounin> In which case GitHub pages may not do it
[03:54:20] <kek_> Rounin, it's usually the server e.g. the reverse proxy no?
[03:54:27] <Rounin> Though it sounds a bit silly to not have that feature, if that's the case
[03:54:53] <kek_> it's probably an issue on my side
[03:54:55] <Rounin> I'm not sure where reverse proxies come in
[03:54:58] <Rounin> Perhaps...
[03:57:06] <kek_> Rounin, mapping <username>.github.io to your actualy location on their server. like virtual hosts.

[07:33:22] <poprocks> Looks like gtk follows a lot of those conventions or was at least inspired by them
[07:33:43] <kzootech> does gtk use compile-time oop?
[07:34:57] <poprocks> not really, no. It's mostly runtime. Like, it'll be able to catch *some* errors at compile-time if you use incompatible casts/pointers

[07:35:33] <kzootech> with xt you have to create class records as structs and such
[07:35:44] <kzootech> which makes the oop a little awkward

[07:36:51] <kzootech> ah so you cant register an new object type (or whatver its called in gtk) at runtime?
[07:36:57] <poprocks> like, gobject relies heavily on a pointer to the first element of a struct being castable to a pointer to the struct itself, and vice versa

[07:41:56] <kzootech> in Xt the class heirarchy is explicit, in gtk it seems you just have to know your parent 
[07:42:12] <poprocks> I'm not an expert though, so there's a lot I don't know. I mean, in a sense, you must be able to create gobjects "at runtime", because we have, eg, python bindings

[07:45:46] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[07:46:01] <kzootech> and then you need a record that has the explicit class heirarchy in the correct order
[07:46:25] <kzootech> directory is a composite widget which is a core widget
[07:46:49] <kzootech> the the directory partwill be your instance variables
[07:47:06] <kzootech> and the record is the collection of all the instance variable structs
[07:47:15] <kzootech> which msuh be in the correct order
[07:47:19] <kzootech> like the class record
[07:47:41] <kzootech> it ends up being a bit terse
[07:48:10] <poprocks> ah, I see. yeah, in gobject you stuff the parent class struct (not a pointer) as the first member of the class you're creating
[07:48:39] <poprocks> and as you go up the chain, the parent class will stuff its parent class as the first member, and so forth, until you get to 'gobject' as the base class
[07:48:54] <kzootech> yeah thats arguable a better way to do it i think
[07:49:18] <kzootech> plus this is just the "private" header
[07:49:34] <kzootech> and you only use it if you are extending the class 
[07:51:26] <poprocks> yeah, gobject has final types and derivable types. with final types, the type is opaque so you can't subclass (ie, stuff the parent into your struct), because you don't have the guts of the struct publicly exposed in a header

[07:55:44] <poprocks> so for `DemoWidget', it subclasses GtkWidget, which only has 'GInitiallyUnowned' aka GObject, the base class, as its parent. So you're supposed to use a macro to cast 'DemoWidgetClass' (in this case) to GObjectClass, but knowing what I know from the headers, calling `klass->parent_class.parent_class.dispose = demo_widget_dispose' to override the 'dispose' virtual function of GObjectClass works

[12:21:16] <Jck_true> Guest15: So basically don't name your package "free-tv-shows-apk-hack-fortnite-bitcoin"
[12:21:57] <Guest15> thanks for the code reference
[12:22:15] <Guest15> that's the package actually: https://github.com/modernmt/modernmt-php
[12:23:26] <Jck_true> Yeah it's being caught by the "mod" regex...

[12:48:12] <Jck_true> Guest15: On a side note. The composer.phar file should not have been added to your repository...
[12:49:16] <Guest15> Jck_true why? does it contain any sensitive information, or doesn't run properly on other machines?

[12:56:05] <Guest15> if the library gets installed with composer instead (which is the common usage) only src content should be included
[12:56:15] <Jck_true> Guest15: To install it just "curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php" 
[12:56:18] <Guest15> or at least that's what I tried to specify in composer.json
[12:57:08] <Jck_true> Guest15: If people just clone your repository they don't really need composer anyway... (Since you don't specifiy any external requirements)
[12:57:32] <Jck_true> But that is just my 2 cents :)

[14:56:16] <chester> if there's a meaningful connection, then there might be something to consider there. But a politician typically have no need for such criminal business, it's a risky one with money they don't need.

[17:32:41] <InPhase> v01d4lph4: Looks like they worked it out in the end, so good on replit to drop the issue.  It's not really novel to put language interpreters online, and replit was definitely not the first or only one to do this.  What's important is that he didn't use any internal code or such to do it.
[17:32:47] <W> [twisti], I mean, doesn't that just mean people shouldn't work for you either? Ability to stay professional and not descend to petty power plays is an important thing to look for in employers that will have outsize power over you

[17:34:02] <InPhase> I've in fact been really looking forward to more competition for repl.it, since while I made heavy use of repl.it in the past, they made it a little harder to use locking it down more to the user accounts.  I have a user account there, and use it, but it's just a little cumbersome to be logging in all the time when I just want to post an occasional example.

[17:35:06] <InPhase> I love that you can go to a site like wandbox.org and put a C++ example that shows the output.  repl.it used to be my choice for doing the same to Python, but now you have to log in and click a whole bunch of extra times just to do it, making it too inconvenient to use as a code demo when answering IRC questions.

[17:37:18] <[twisti]> im glad they seem to have worked it out in a very adult way
[17:37:53] <InPhase> I understand one would want resource limits, but a useful balance I think would be to put timeouts on code that's not linked to a logged in account.  repl.it should probably do that instead, and then I'd give them probably at least one link online a week.  :)

[19:10:02] <InPhase> Slight boosts in cost for faster disk and cpu.  But I find those base performance levels excellent for a general purpose VPS that you can use for things like a site, email, IRC clients, or general remote Linux server things that fit within the space limits.
[19:10:07] <Sadale> a6a45081-2b83, What do you plan to do with a VPS?
[19:10:34] <Sadale> oh. you said website and selenium crons.
[19:10:38] <Sadale> sorry for missing that.
[19:10:44] <a6a45081-2b83> nah that should be fine
[19:10:49] <InPhase> a6a45081-2b83: Basically, a VPS is cheaper than a shared webhost now, you just have to be able to install apache yourself.  Which is trivial, and good experience if you haven't done it.
[19:10:52] <a6a45081-2b83> 256gb and 1 tb are separate?
[19:10:54] <InPhase> And then you get extras.
[19:11:00] <Sadale> To me tho $5/month actually adds up.
[19:11:15] <Sadale> I didn't realize that until I start budgeting.
[19:11:37] <InPhase> Well if you're employed, $5/month is nothing.  If you're not yet employed, then I guess budget.
[19:11:42] <Sadale> $5 per month is actually $60 per year. I could have purchase something else (like a raspberry pi) for that.
[19:11:48] <Sadale> oh I'm employed.
[19:12:14] <InPhase> Well except that comes with high levels of server-room bandwidth and good up time.
[19:12:20] <Sadale> But still it's just something that I have to pay to keep my website running. So I don't really have a choice unless I'm opting for a less reliable VPS provier.

[19:13:57] <Sadale> It really depends on your budget tho. If you're frugal like me $5 a month is a lot. I mean I almost always pick the cheapest meal possible for saving money. :P
[19:15:17] <Sadale> Jokes aside, it depends on where you're living in as well. In the US or larger cities over the world $5/month is probably nothing. In places with lower living cost, $5/month could be a lot.
[19:16:07] <InPhase> Sadale: I used to be frugal with my food as well in my younger years.  Now I eat the food that keeps me happiest, because when I'm happy I work better, and when I work better I can eventually make more money.  So it pays back I figure, within reason.  :)
[19:16:42] <Sadale> InPhase, good for you. :3 I'm the opposite here. I didn't care about how much I was spending while I was a bit younger. xD
[19:17:10] <Sadale> InPhase, I switched job and got paid better. Then I started planning for early retirement. That's why I started being super frugal.
[19:17:28] <PlanckWalk> I don't really see paying for a VPS to be "keeping a website running".
[19:17:55] <PlanckWalk> I see it as running a server that handles multiple functions and has its own internet connection.
[19:17:56] *** Quits: bsdbandit01 (~bsdbandit@172.58.239.59) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:18:10] <Sadale> PlanckWalk, to be precise, it's multiple websites, plus scripts and shit.
[19:18:15] <PlanckWalk> (And I can SSH to it from my phone if needed)
[19:18:38] <Sadale> PlanckWalk, yep. exactly what you said. It has multiple functions. I'm just too lazy to include everything into a single sentence. So I just said website.
[19:18:46] <PlanckWalk> Yeah
[19:18:47] <InPhase> Ah.  I grew up with parents that didn't have too much, so we gardened and clipped coupons and such to save food money.  Those were my baseline habits.  But, now I have degrees and make more than my parents ever did.
[19:18:55] <Sadale> It turned out that I have to elaborate on that with extra sentences :(
[19:19:22] <Sadale> InPhase, ah. makes sense. Glad to hear that your degree pays off.
[19:19:30] <InPhase> A VPS though, that's reasonably a career investment.  You can build marketable skills working with one.
[19:19:35] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't do anything that my home computers can't do, but the extra (and faster!) Internet connection is worth it on its own to me.
[19:19:40] <Sadale> I agree.
[19:20:00] <Sadale> Make your own site and put shit there. It's a nice way to market yourself to employers.

[20:44:45] <quippy> in a very technical and literal sense there are two internets, v6 and v4, and we've gotten to the point where there are ISPs with no v4 addresses and vice versa, so to access "the other Internet" you have to have a tunnel
[20:44:59] <quippy> pretty wild if you ask me
[20:46:07] <InPhase> quippy: Well the plan was that by this point, everyone would support ipv6 as a minimum, and ipv4 could phase out.

[20:48:56] <c705> i grew up with nat - it's crazy for me to think of my gateway without nat at all
[20:49:11] <quippy> you can still use NAT with IPv6; there are private addresses

[20:50:26] <quippy> my ISP doesn't give me v6 lol
[20:50:35] <deniska> well, we can always crack open 127.0.0.0/8 network :D
[20:50:39] <c705> if my ISP starts handing me an ip6 they'd better give me advanced notice. I guess i'd have to tunnel it
[20:50:46] <quippy> my ISP also blocks port 80 incoming and it pisses me off to no end
[20:50:54] <c705> quippy: yeah, that's dum

[22:46:17] <InPhase> kzootech: On a header-only library I wrote a while ago, the files are on average 455 lines, but range from 70 to 2350.  These get bigger because some of them do more complicated things to achieve their core purpose, and since it was header-only a lot more got packed into single headers.  But, that had a price in terms of navigability.  So there are trade-offs happening once they get to these larger

[22:47:15] <InPhase> kzootech: I think the target goals in general should be closer to my first example, of 150 lines for a source file, 75 lines for a header file, with a few ranging larger.

[22:51:13] <InPhase> kzootech: Well, you don't want to break it down MORE than the separability that's natural to the architecture.  But this is more of a proxy metric for how well you've isolated pieces of your architecture and their interactions.

The client ends can be simple and mostly straight html for some purposes, in which case the bulk is about your choices for the server side.
[23:03:46] <InPhase> kiwichap: Given your inexperience, it is worth taking kzootech's concern seriously and looking for some sort of framework for authentication to patch over your inexperience if this involves both real money and your job.
[23:04:04] <kiwichap> yes so server side should I write it in java which is giving me headaches, .net which I don't know if it works on freebsd or not, common lisp which could be complicated, python sounds trendy but have no clue about, php that seems easy but I discover thing I don't know

[23:28:16] <GeDaMo> I tried to persuade my college to get a C compiler so I could try it; they were teaching us COBOL :|
[23:28:18] <kiwichap> hyper text transfer protocol, there's TCP/IP, consisting of several layers there's an OSI model 
[23:28:19] <kzootech> i lost my "Teach yourself QBASIC in 24 hours" book though, sort of sad about that now
[23:28:22] <poprocks> kzootech: haha awesome. my first programming book was a book on BASIC programming I bought at the Ontario Science Centre.
[23:28:25] <kzootech> that was my first programming book
[23:28:30] <quippy> basically the form you wrote, when you click Submit, will send an HTTP POST request with the form data from the form encoded into it, according to the formdata spec
[23:28:40] <kiwichap> I did a get request
[23:28:50] <kiwichap> post would be unsafe
[23:28:51] <poprocks> I didn't think I had a BASIC interpreter on my 386 I had as a kid, so I would write programs down on paper and imagine how they would run
[23:28:57] <quippy> no that's incorrect kiwichap 
[23:29:04] <poprocks> imagine my thrill when I found a mysterious binary called ``qbasic.exe'' on my machine
[23:29:05] <quippy> you want the username and password in a POST body
[23:29:13] <kzootech> poprocks: i did that at school all the time
[23:29:16] <kiwichap> ok thanks for clarifying it's the opposite
[23:29:17] <InPhase> kzootech: I remember trying to upgrade to QBasic, and finding the lack of line numbers weirdly disconcerting.
[23:29:18] <kzootech> it looked like i was taking notes lol
[23:29:29] <quippy> technically the HTTP verb doesn't matter, the part that matters is that you want it sent in the body of the Request and not as a URL parameter
[23:29:34] <kiwichap> ok it's post now
[23:29:42] <quippy> because URL parameters get recorded in proxies sometimes so then passwords get captured by intermediaries

[23:29:57] <kiwichap> yes I just got them mixed up
[23:29:59] <kzootech> i never really programmed much in basic that had line numbers
[23:30:05] <quippy> :+1: yep sorry for over-explaining
[23:30:25] <kiwichap> so I guess now I need a database connection?
[23:30:31] <kzootech> qbasic, tibasic and visual basic are the only basic languages i really have ever used
[23:30:33] <poprocks> I wish my first PC was a C64
[23:30:43] <quippy> well you need a service that can receive the POST request and then do something with that data kiwichap 
[23:30:45] <kiwichap> if I want to make it in java I need to configure tomcat and reroute it there somehow
[23:30:48] <kzootech> maybe some dark basic in the late 90s/early 2000s?
[23:30:58] <quippy> are you able to just receive the POST in Java land and print it out?
[23:31:00] <kiwichap> like I did for this nodejs website : https://ggtraduction.com 
[23:31:02] <Hitchens> Link: Traducteur francais
[23:31:04] <poprocks> kzootech: ooh, darkbasic.
[23:31:22] <kiwichap> ok I will try the java
[23:31:39] <quippy> yeah step 1 is just receiving the request in Java and printing it out so you can see the data move from the client to the server
[23:31:41] <kiwichap> it's going to be complicated a bit to configure it but I will trust I can figure that out
[23:32:04] <kiwichap> it's not on java now and with java I need to run a reverse proxy to awldmsystems:8080
[23:32:09] <kiwichap> something like that
[23:32:26] <InPhase> My first ever program was '10 PRINT "HELLO"'   My second ever program was '10 PRINT "HI"'   My third program was  '10 PRINT "HI"'  '20 GOTO 10', and after I ran that I knew I had to spend my life writing programs.
[23:32:27] <kiwichap> in order to simplify I could just build on 8080 now
[23:32:36] <quippy> yeah just access the site on 8080 for now
[23:32:42] <quippy> later you can worry about setting up a reverse proxy
[23:34:00] <GeDaMo> For a second I thought you were talking about the 8080 CPU :P
[23:34:06] <quippy> lmao
[23:34:13] <kiwichap> no it was the 8086
[23:34:16] <kiwichap> just joking
[23:34:31] <kiwichap> what about a 286 ? 
[23:34:36] <quippy> my first attempt at programming was because of a book on 8086 assembly
[23:34:43] <Guest49> InPhase: wasn't it so annoying that each time you added a line in between two, you had to change the line counter of all the lines after it? e.g. you have `10 PRINT "HI"; 20 PRINT "WORLD"` and then you want to add `20 PRINT "HELLO"` inbetween those two and you need to change the third line to `30 PRINT "WORLD"`, right?
[23:34:46] <kzootech> PRINT "Hello World!"
[23:34:48] <quippy> it was nearly the year 2000 but whatever
[23:34:50] <kzootech> that would have been mine
[23:34:51] <kiwichap> 286 was bad but 386

[23:44:04] * kzootech wonders how different his life would be if he had happened on emacs before vim
[23:44:29] <quippy> I used vim for almost a decade before switching to Emacs, and I use evil-mode inside Emacs and still reach for vim on occasion. I never stopped having the muscle memory for vim on the commandline, so I have vim aliased to `emacsclient -a/usr/bin/vim $@` which opens files in an Emacs frame on TTY if Emacs is running, or opens vim

[23:45:23] <quippy> I still have vim muscle memory, evil-mode is just a better vim than the o.g. C vim
[23:45:23] <poprocks> haha. back in the day, the knowledge I was given was that you should learn vi(m) because it will be on any system you may encounter, whereas emacs may not be. now people seem comfortable installing an Electron program made by Microsoft which is hundreds of megabytes large to edit their code
