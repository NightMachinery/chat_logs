[00:52:44] <morf> dunno why, probably no tourists and increased energy prices fucked the market
[00:53:18] <morf> i don't have money / can't find quickly long-term "normal" rent... and only option is long-term hotel which like is also complete shit 
[00:53:35] <morf> and everything
[00:53:54] <morf> with all the everything else i'm so fucked

[02:14:10] <TXDillo> nice
[02:14:37] <morlog> i think i can do a better job at designing one

[07:29:22] <morf> the ballet is from carmen
[07:29:26] <morf> so i resarch
[07:29:29] <morf> The first scene is set in a street in Seville, where the dancing of a crowd is interrupted by a girl being chased by Carmen. Their fight is only stopped by the arrival of Don José, who assists Carmen's defeated opponent. As he is about to arrest Carmen he is struck by her allure and arranges an assignation for later. That evening in the tavern Don José enters and dances a zapateado to the music of the habanera. Carmen next appears 
[07:29:29] <morf> and dances, ending at Don José's feet; he lifts her up and they go up to the bedroom. 
[07:29:31] <morf> XDDDD
[07:29:33] <morf> how convenient
[07:30:38] <morf> The final scene is set outside the bull-ring where girls await the arrival of their hero, the toreador. He enters and greets them but is fascinated by the indifference shown by Carmen. José enters and notices their looks. The toreador moves into the arena whereupon Don José threatens Carmen, and in a fight to the death he overcomes her. As she dies, hats are tossed from the bull-ring to land at his feet.
[07:30:41] <morf> what?

[19:36:22] <murthy> Nature
[19:36:32] <Chickie> many people have these experiences
[19:36:44] <murthy> nativetexan: life begins when two people make love
[19:38:03] <murthy> Chickie: There are a lot of stuff that can't be explained in terms of human knowledge. Experience is true way to know
[19:38:29] <Chickie> yes we have a lot of people who believe as you do
[19:38:35] <Chickie> i feel you

[19:45:34] <nativetexan> do you know what kind of music yet?
[19:45:39] <murthy> Panther: That is common
[19:46:00] <Panther> Juan Castillo has been running the #1 radio station in New Haven for years, and he said he will personally train my voice and help me establish myself as a 'personality.'
[19:46:03] <murthy> Panther: You need exposure
[19:46:15] <nativetexan> wow

[19:51:56] <Panther> I was on the phone with him for 45 mins, nd we had a good time chatting, so he seems like someone I can get along with.
