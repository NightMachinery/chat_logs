[02:17:41] <quest> also if your computer has a hardware kill switch, it would appear this way as well, but since downgrade worked for you I doubt it is that
[02:18:22] <tyzoid> Ah, here it is
[02:18:23] <tyzoid> `manager: Networking is disabled by state file`
[02:18:35] <tyzoid> Glanced over it because the previous boot says 'enabled'

[02:18:56] <tyzoid> `rfkill: Wi-Fi hardware radio set enabled`
[02:18:59] <tyzoid> so it's not rfkill
[02:19:06] <tyzoid> That said, I'm not sure what state file it might be referring to
[02:19:21] <quest> there could be confs in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/ ... let me try to find the state thing
[02:19:44] <tyzoid> conf.d is an empty directory

[02:20:08] <yaymukund> another|: hm, you're saying 'usb-c' is meaningless in this context? It's an ipad air connector and a framework laptop usb-c port, if that's of any use. Not sure how to get more info.

[02:22:43] <quest> fantastic!
[02:22:48] <tyzoid> That's terrible design though... it crashes, so you have no network until you delete the old file
[02:23:13] <quest> yeah, it could compare the state file to the uptime and nuke it automatically if it was a reboot
[02:23:37] <quest> no reason to keep that stale state around, or could have just put it in tmp

[06:21:10] <jonathon> i can easily switch it between showing a titlebar or tabs in the "titlebar", but other settings aren't honoured, e.g. my titlebar button alignment, it takes the GNOME default of a single close button on the right, and it uses adwaita rather than my current theme
[06:21:48] <jonathon> i suspect there's some dconf hive hidden away, i just haven't found a way of accessing it yet :/

[13:23:11] <mpan> There is nothing wrong in that case. WoT is not solving any issue here, as the package signing already has a natural authority.
[13:23:15] <dbrgn> Foxboron: the way we use it in arch, there is no trust (besides having a key imported) either, right?
[13:23:18] <Foxboron> That's the issue. And I don't see how it would necessarily work better without some explicit trust scheme. Distros are weird, it's not only aout signatures

It's an intel card, uses the iwlwifi driver. it works for like five minutes, but then it fails and the machine is no longer reachable on the network. I thought this was maybe related to wifi power saving, so I added `power_save=0` to `/etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf` but I still get the same problem.

[13:27:34] <Foxboron> dbrgn: I don't think distros can work without some way to reliably assign trust. So minisign is too simple
[13:28:09] <Foxboron> I think there can be a scheme in the future where packager keys are not used to validate packages, and minisign is used by a signing enclave and then verified on the user machines

[13:28:41] <mpan> dbrgn: but even if they weren’t, it wouldn’t be a problem. WoT solves the problem of CAs. But in this case CA already exists, naturally.
[13:28:45] <dbrgn> minisign might make sense for AUR though, where often you don't have a good trust root.
[13:29:10] <Foxboron> but you still need to use some trust structure for packagers

[13:30:23] <dbrgn> anyways, Foxboron, do you know why the pacman-dev patch uses asignify (https://pkgs.org/download/asignify) instead of minisign (https://pkgs.org/download/minisign)? the latter is written by the libsodium team and seems more widely known. minisign is also backwards compatible with signify signatures, I don't know about asignify.
[13:31:35] <Foxboron> dbrgn: I don't know. The author thought the library was easier to use in pacman
[13:31:57] *** Quits: bart (~bart@47.187.88.10) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[13:32:19] <Foxboron> The format is the same so it shouldn't matter. The original minisign might not be a suitable library
[13:32:56] <dbrgn> it does look simpler, since it uses tweetnacl and not libsodium. I wasn't sure about compatibility, because the README explicitly talks about replacing SHA checksums with blake. minisign did the same, but I don't know if the formats are compatible.
[13:33:19] <Foxboron> I don't know. Feel free to test the patches :)

[16:15:53] <luigibu> so.. migrating my isntalation to new hardware.. i re-instaled grub, but when i try to boot i get: ERROR: decive 'UUID=XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX' not found. skiping fsck. however the uuid seams correct as is the same as the fstab. any clue? thanks

[23:36:17] <evilop> if the firmware is sane, then mashing f8 to get a boot menu, or changign from the normal firmware menu should show it
