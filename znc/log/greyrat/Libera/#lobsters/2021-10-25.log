[01:01:12] <drobilla> Yeah I highly recommend keeping your wagon as far away from everything GTeam does as possible
[01:01:12] <technomancy> embedding a language in your program is a million times better
[01:01:20] <drobilla> You /will/ get fucked
[01:01:35] <technomancy> or rather, not embedding a language that allows your end user to program your application makes it borderline defective
[01:01:43] <meff[m]> do it the old-fashioned way: open a unix socket that lets people send commands over
[01:01:54] <technomancy> meff[m]: that requires a command language =)
[01:02:02] <technomancy> if you do it right, you're just adding a repl

[01:02:06] <meff[m]> yeah
[01:02:19] <drobilla> Shame, though.  The basic idea of a protocol like that is pretty good, and if there were universally understood/available/used language bindings on that, it'd be a pretty nice situation

[10:22:57] <rb> serenityOS discord has a rule: "do not shit on things you are not actively working on to improve". it makes for really nice conversation once you stop going "oh x sucks", you can instead go "x has foo, bar, baz problem, y does this better"
[10:22:59] <rb> much more constructive

[10:24:58] <rb> well if you're working on it then you can call it shitty code ;^)

[16:40:51] <pja> So an iPhone may be more expensive, but you get to keep using it for longer.

[16:41:52] <deadk> pja: insufficient in what way
[16:41:56] <pja> Lineage can patch Android holes, but they can’t patch holes in the closed source vendor device drivers & nor can they do much about the kernel if it’s diverged too much from mainline (which it always has).
[16:42:03] <riv> it's really annoying..
[16:42:08] <rb> yeah that's fair, it's unfortunate
[16:42:13] <pja> deadk: Not enough to get you a secure device.
[16:42:19] <rb> hardware security is not in my threat model, so i don't mind. hopefully we'll have a phone in the future which allows one to use his own certificates to lock/unlock bootloader
[16:42:38] <pja> Or, rather, one where the known security issues have been patched at leasdt.
[16:43:04] <pja> rb: Sadly that means that, for instance, OpenGL drivers are part of your threat model.
[16:43:19] <rb> i don't install apps i don't know much about
[16:43:26] <pja> & of course all Apps have access to the screen.
[16:43:27] <rb> f-droid is a pretty cool app store
[16:43:31] <deadk> is there any mainstream phone which is secure against attackers that control their cell network
[16:44:03] <pja> So Lineage just isn’t enough, unless you can get your hands on a phone where the drivers are also being patched.
[16:44:13] <pja> deadk: Again, Apple devices.
[16:44:19] <deadk> riv: i haven't ever experienced an android phone doing that. in fact i think every android device i've ever owned is still working perfectly except for the battery and headphone jack
[16:44:19] <rb> dunno about that, but if that's my threat model then my phone being tampered with is probably the least of my worries

[16:45:57] <pja> In a lot of Android devices, the mobile chipset has DMA access to device memory, with no oversight by the application processor. So if the baseband is compromised it’s game over.
[16:46:07] <iDrougge> I still think it's sad that Microsoft failed with Windows Phone. It at least had some novel ideas instead of Android's retrofit of an Iphone clone OS on top of some Java thing made for smartphones with a trackball and a keyboard.
