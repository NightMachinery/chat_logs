[00:00:38] <mockturtle> World Quality Report 2021-22: 8 key takeaways for your software team [testing] (asteroid) https://lobste.rs/s/x2smty
[00:01:47] <river> yes I am deuill
[00:02:13] <mockturtle> to secure the supply chain, you must properly fund it [practices] (cadey) https://lobste.rs/s/jiy0xs
[00:03:19] <river> that book sounds very interseting
[00:03:24] <river> very philosophical
[00:04:16] <deuill> Williamson is great! The book itself covers quite a bit of space (historically and otherwise), including some discussion on automated theorem solving (as it pertains to solving for higher-level vagueness) -- I'm still exploring though.
[00:06:30] <deuill> Ever since I played with Inform 7 I've got this idea stuck in my head of a natural [language] programming language where you define concepts top-down rather than bottom-up, and where the compiler operates against a knowledge of how "complete" a concept is, and whether the concept is used outside of its definition (i.e. in the penumbra of vague application).
[00:07:19] <deuill> Sort of like something between a logic programming language and something... else? Not sure how to best express.
[00:11:21] <river> I like the sound of that
[00:11:33] <river> it could even ask if it needed more information

[02:49:34] <demize> JordiGH: https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/ has pretty much all of the relevant details.
[02:50:44] <demize> TL;DR get an application to log a string that references an LDAP server that serves a Java object, and log4j it'll fetch it for you.
[02:50:52] <gerikson> TIL there was something called log4j*2*
[02:53:46] <demiurge> log4j2 helpfully just calls itself log4j in lots of places
[02:54:25] <epilys> the problem with this exploit is that you have to sit down and write java
[02:54:34] <demiurge> which i suspect will mean beleaguered engineering managers the world over are ignoring things that are actually vulnerable because they say log4j not log4j2
[02:54:48] <JordiGH> So I first need to host my own ldap server to do nasty things with, eh_
[02:55:16] <companion_cube> epilys: or any jvm language I think?
[02:55:20] <demize> JordiGH: Nah, there are handy pre-made things to stuff upp for you: https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/CVE-2021-44228-Apache-Log4j-Rce

[02:56:05] <demize> demiurge: Like with almost all other software in the world it doesn't include the major version number in the project name, yes.  :p
[02:58:01] <demize> JordiGH: But if you actually want to try it you should of course build the thing that actually acts as a pretend LDAP server from source rather than using their pre-built one.  :p

[03:00:29] <epilys> building uninspected source is better than downloading a prebuilt binary?

[05:17:58] <bkero> lol.
[05:18:26] <bkero> The reality distortion field is real.
[05:18:31] <bkero> (still)
[05:18:47] <iDrougge> It even distorted Samsung.
[05:18:51] <pe> Today I accidentally found Apple's WWDC talks, several, on the subject of HEIF and editing with depth maps, it was quite enlightening.
[05:20:02] <bkero> Now if they'd actually use a non-patent-encumbered format.
[05:20:20] <bkero> MPEG-LA
[05:20:34] <pe> Fuck patents, give me ISO PDFs.
[05:20:42] <pe> Patents are for burgers to care about.
[05:21:56] <pe> JPEG-XL is also mostly a money-walled thing.
[05:23:14] <bkero> Must be nice, not to be burdened by the complexities of the world.
[05:26:09] <JordiGH> Quick way to remove 512 bytes from the start of a file?
[05:26:27] <pe> tail, dd
[05:26:35] <JordiGH> tail can work on bytes?
[05:26:36] <JordiGH> Hm.
[05:26:36] <companion_cube> tail -c +512
[05:26:38] <companion_cube> I think
[05:26:51] <pe> Oh, they do have a conference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6iyrnyrWpA
[05:26:51] <mockturtle> [ Samsung Blockchain is Open for Partnerships ] - www.youtube.com
[05:26:52] <companion_cube> maybe +511, you need to test
[05:27:53] <pe> Or 513
[05:28:31] <pe> I used this a few hours ago.
[05:28:43] <pe> Either I was weirdly off, or I had to increment.
[05:32:16] <JordiGH> Yes, 513.
[05:32:22] <JordiGH> The first byte isn't the zeroth byte.
[05:32:54] <JordiGH> Context: need to remove the useless 512-byte header from a SNES ROM I found in, ah, my internet travels.
[05:33:53] <companion_cube> or you can whip out python and use a byte slice I guess
