[05:43:45] <metaljack34> phrik: i can connect to our VPN server with ipsec, but can't open restricted webpages even if VPN shows it's connected
[05:43:45] <phrik> metaljack34: The answer is 42.
[05:44:05] <metaljack34> I was wondering if I need to add routing table myself
[05:44:16] <lantech19446> jonathon: it's a gigabit internet connection so i should be getting at minimum 800Mbps
[05:45:00] <jonathon> that doesn't mean your wifi will work at that speed, though? also, verify with an Ethernet cable.

[05:46:51] <lantech19446> i'll have to wait until i get back home to try ethernet cable, I see no reason it wouldn't
[05:47:03] <jonathon> wifi can be impacted by all sorts of things, e.g. microwave ovens
[05:47:20] <jonathon> (i guess 5GHz less so, but...)
[05:48:23] <lantech19446> each channel on ac should be capable of about 866Mbps I'm using 5GHz no microwaves on very little in between me and the radio etc
[05:49:05] <lantech19446> apparently the driver that's installed is the only linux driver for intel that supports AC though
[05:50:30] <jonathon> have you checked what your router is doing? e.g. how many other connected devices, traffic levels, ...?
[05:50:45] <lantech19446> i just realized i can't test this with a cable it doesn't have a port
[05:51:11] <lantech19446> the modem is getting full throughput i have one other device on it and it'd idle

[07:08:25] <Sid> Does anyone here use systemd-homed? I had an issue with logging in, so I nuked the loopback device, created a new one, restored files from backup but noticed that shell=/usr/bin/bash and shell=/bin/bash behave differently
[07:08:39] <Sid> The former simply doesn't work to log in, the latter works fine
[07:08:53] <Sid> To test, run: homectl create test --storage=luks --shell=/usr/bin/bash --disk-size 2G
[07:09:32] <Sid> It won't work to log in to that test account until you run: homectl update test --shell=/bin/bash
[07:09:46] <CannabisIndica> then bash is in /bin/bash not /usr/bin/bash

[07:17:14] <thebombzen> but no package owns this directory and it causes dkms to get annoyed
[07:17:16] <CannabisIndica> that sucks. you did it though Sid.
[07:17:19] <NetSysFire> do you usee the kernel modules hook to avoid reboots?
[07:17:37] <thebombzen> I typically reboot when I upgrade the kernel or its modules
[07:17:40] <thebombzen> so no

[21:43:27] <spalf> xrandr --newmode 1280x1024_75.00  138.75  1280 1368 1504 1728  1024 1027 1034 1072 -hsync +vsync

[21:43:43] <spalf> but now it just shows 1 or 2 lines after boot and after x starts
[21:43:54] <spalf> i tried with an old thinkpad i got, with a real vga output and it still works there
[21:44:01] <spalf> so i think its got somethin to do with the DP-3 or something

[22:21:39] <Namarrgon> some of the drivers just mislabel the ports
[22:23:16] <arcorion> True, though if they are using a CRT and a direct VGA connection worked, the adapter may be faulty.

[23:12:32] <spalf> so it looks like it something to do with the AMDGPU or?
[23:12:45] <spalf> because when i was using modeset like in the old log it worked
[23:13:03] <spalf> maybe i had it not installed before?

[23:19:16] <MrElendig> same as ctime probably

[23:20:18] <susi> ctime and atime seem to differ, so probably mtime 
[23:20:19] <MrElendig> also grub might not set atime anyway
[23:21:16] <susi> it's the program who controls that, not some filesystem level stuff?
[23:21:32] <spalf> not => now**
[23:21:32] <MrElendig> technically fat32 can have atime but its like a one day resolution or something like that
