If I add ldd $cmd right before it, it finds a particular shared library in the right place.

[04:32:02] <Dagmar> Let's say I create a commonly named library, like, say, libreadline.so
[04:32:12] <Dagmar> ...and I insert into it a function named open().
[04:32:17] <nightstrike> -rwsrwxrwx 1 root << that's their perms... you're saying that that messes with how the loader uses LD_LIB_PATH?

[04:33:35] <Khaytsus> What, lawn darts?
[04:33:43] <nightstrike> I understand the exploit, but I've been using LD_LIBRARY_PATH in this way for ages...    certainly, on centos 6 there's no such restriction.  Is this new for centos 7, which is glibc..... 2.17?
[04:33:47] <Dagmar> More fun than lawn darts.  I got root on all kindsa stuff abusing that

[17:57:00] <xcm> hey all. i want to measure total MB up/down for an interface. however, i use wireguard and noticed that data transfered over wireguard is not added to the physical interface's counters. is there a way to get the total data used? (summing them up is not enough because wg could be operating over different interfaces at different times)
[17:57:29] <djph> xcm: data over wg should ultimately still show over a physical interface though ...
[17:57:55] <djph> ... well, "should"

[18:42:41] <abradabara> ayecee: yeah, it's just annoying
[18:42:50] <Thuryn> otisolsen70, doesn't sound too bad, though you should lay out more precisely what the time committments are and support expectations are for a setup like that.
[18:43:09] <Thuryn> in order to "stay current," you'll have to spend time on them regularly to see what people have been changing without telling you.

[18:43:31] <Thuryn> and support requests ALWAYS end up being time critical.

[18:45:19] <otisolsen70> Thuryn, yeah, so this is where I would really like to hear how other people typically approach this. I was thinking something like a basic plan is priced at the price of 4 hours per month. Then 1 hour per month spend on staying current. And then customer can use up to 3 hours that are included. And pay regular rate on top of that.

[21:09:09] <ayecee> Nomikos: short of that, seems like you'd have to have a separate config. doesn't sound terrible; the script could call the logrotate for its own logs right after it finishes.

[22:01:55] <noobaroo> systemd is monolothic and very complex. a huge change from script based init systems . Not only is the init+service manager itself way more featureful and complex, which imo is a good thing, but systemd also comes with a horde of other functions like systemd-resolved and systemd-timesyncd and the list goes on

[22:26:44] <phogg> noobaroo: I am not in denial about systemd and its purported effect on boot times, it is just that any effect on boot times are orthogonal to the conversation about whether systemd is bloated or not. Totally unrelated.
