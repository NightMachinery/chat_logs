[02:17:21] <Bayes> hi, my name is Bayes and I'm excited to be part of this contest! Here's my candidate for the ugliest piece of code ever written:
[02:17:33] <Bayes> `oaat <- sapply(asplit(X, 2), function(x) hetGP::mleHomGP(matrix(x), y)$ll)`
[02:18:35] <Bayes> vectorization can be beautiful sometimes
[02:18:47] <Bayes> not in this case tho xD

[18:46:54] <fendur> Bayes: i've wondered that. it always felt too hacky so i never used it
[18:47:46] <fendur> i mean, why is hacky bad? i don't know. let us know if you find something
[18:56:13] <confuzeus> looks like changing the distribution rather than scaling
[18:57:10] <fendur> it would be useful in the case that a ratio variable somehow made sense in the negatives and 0 was meaningful
[18:58:01] <velix> confuzeus: Yeah, I wasn't able to solve it in R. I think, I'll keep it in php and be happy ;)
[18:58:18] <velix> confuzeus: The mutate was too mutating to me.
[18:59:46] <confuzeus> velix: agree to happiness first. i still think you could have gotten the php work in R with minimal changes (if you used arrays).

[19:04:47] <velix> confuzeus: Sure. That's easy. But I wanted to do the R challenge with the magic R tools :D
[19:04:55] <velix> But it's like ... SpaceX science.
[19:09:17] <confuzeus> your initial issue was that you could not do it in R but then you try to jump into an advanced R variant...and expect that to be easy?
[19:24:50] <Bayes> fendur well, I guess for visualization it'd work
[19:25:47] <Bayes> but since it's not monotone, you can only use it in the few places where you don't care about monotonicity
[19:26:08] <fendur> Bayes: what would be an example of a variable for which it would make some kind of analytical sense?
[19:26:33] <Bayes> I mean, maybe because it's not bijective
[19:26:40] <Bayes> fendur oh, for viz mostly
[19:27:12] <fendur> Bayes: i mean a variable. like what would you measure, and then want to analyze somehow, that would benefit from a transform like that
[19:28:40] <Bayes> also, I'm talking off my head here but how is a signed log (as defined above) that different from thinking of an effect that's symmetrical around zero coupled with a "direction" effect (AKA sign)
[19:29:35] <Bayes> fendur any variable that you might square, e.g., a distance in an spatial model with radial basis (say GP with exponential cov fun)
[19:34:03] <Bayes> again maybe I'm not thinking this deeply enough
[19:34:15] <Bayes> it totally does feel like an off the book hack :D
[19:38:33] <fendur> like financial balances
[19:38:43] <fendur> they can go negative and you'd expect them to behave similar in both directions, I think
[19:38:52] <Bayes> possibly yep
[19:39:11] <Bayes> anything where you wish you had one direction and you have both around a (centered) origin I guess
[19:39:47] <fendur> id word it like anything where you want increments to represent orders of magnitude in both directions
[19:42:55] <Bayes> fwiw, I'm using it for this _viz_ https://i.imgur.com/bYcIDjJ.png
[19:43:29] <fendur> wait. would that get funny for logs < 1 and > 0?
[19:43:36] <fendur> and similar for -1 and 0
[19:43:58] <Bayes> cause it doesn't make sense to have the x axis in natural scale and have them all pushed to the extremes
[19:44:31] <fendur> sorry for x < 1 and > 0
[19:45:31] <fendur> if you're dealing with integers, though, you could just specify that log(0)==0
[19:46:45] <fendur> that would be weird too if log(1) still == 0
[19:47:00] <Bayes> ah I see what you mean
[19:47:05] <Bayes> just normalize anything to 0-1 :P
[19:47:16] <Bayes> which is something that I end up doing more often than not
[19:47:20] <Bayes> i has a nice interpretation
[19:56:14] <confuzeus> as long as you cannot back transform easily, the nice properties do not make sense. may be in machine learning??
[19:57:43] <Bayes> confuzeus which one? the signed log?
[19:58:39] <confuzeus> i mean any transformation which nice math properties that somehow ignores reality
[19:58:49] <Bayes> o.O
[19:59:55] <Bayes> I mean, I agree, but I wouldn't say any of the stuff we've been discussing ignores reality

[20:28:22] <rickyrick> Bayes: Wouldn't that only work if x was all positive or all negative
[20:33:12] <Bayes> wouldn't that beat the point of having a signed log cf log?
[20:33:38] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:33:55] <Bayes> there's a center and a signed distance, but you want to measureÂ  such signed distance in orders of magnitudes
[20:34:53] <Bayes> e.g., what happens to the response when I push one order of magnitude in some direction vs two orders of magnitude in some direction
[20:34:59] *** Joins: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso)
[20:35:48] <rickyrick> The problem is that for x with magnitude < 1 the transformed values cross into the other side
[20:36:52] <rickyrick> i.e. f(0.1) = -2.30 but f(-10) also = -2.30
[20:38:02] <Bayes> oh gotcha
[20:38:19] <Bayes> yeah that makes sense
[20:38:37] <Bayes> I was working with all values x > 1 or x < -1 so didn't have that situation
[20:38:44] <rickyrick> Yeah
[20:38:47] <Bayes> but that's trivial
[20:38:53] <Bayes> just find a large constant?
[20:38:56] <Bayes> multiply
[20:38:59] <Bayes> and all that?
[20:39:06] <rickyrick> Though the additional invariant under this transformation is that f(-exp(x)) = f(exp(-x))
[20:39:26] <rickyrick> So if in your original data -exp(x) = exp(-x) makes sense, then you could use it
[20:39:55] <Bayes> I mean why would that be an issue with x = -.01, x = .01 meters but not with x = -1 and x = 1 cm?

[20:41:10] <rickyrick> However!
[20:41:23] <rickyrick> You can just patch that out with sign(x) * log(abs(x) + 1)

[20:42:10] <Bayes> it needs some work but it can make sense afterall :P
