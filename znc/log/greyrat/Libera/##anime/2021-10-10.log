[01:29:05] <MootPoot> Without OC and just gaming 
[01:29:15] <ButterNoodle> and the new egg shuffles are $900 for a 3070.. not even a ti
[01:29:18] <MootPoot> 3080 is like 30w less
[01:29:29] <MootPoot> What is a Newegg shuffle anyway
[01:29:35] <Bco1981> MootPoot: shortly the 3090ti will take 450

[01:30:20] <MootPoot> Unless the die gets like 20% bigger...but it's already huge as it is

[01:54:05] <emmeka> lastonestanding I thought it was 60

[01:54:59] <MootPoot> afaik I did look into it 
[01:55:02] <MootPoot> the fps thing
[01:55:05] <emmeka> your eye can't detect the change above 60fps, but you can tell the difference between 30 and 60, which is why analog interlaced TV looks flickery to the human eye but progressive scan looks stable
[01:55:24] <MootPoot> the way human eye detets stuff cant really be categorized into FPS
[01:55:27] <MootPoot> in the same way
[01:55:45] <emmeka> the reason higher refresh rates make a difference with digital displays is just basically an inherent drawback of the way the display works
[01:55:46] <MootPoot> we've had air force testing showing detection of a thing at 25000 fps
[01:55:54] <MootPoot> and people failing to do it at 500 fps

[01:58:36] <MootPoot> to many other things are invovled, like how the display shows things
[02:00:23] <emmeka> right, the problem with digital displays is less to do with the refresh rate and more to do with the fact that there's inherent artifacting, ghosting, tearing, things like that.
[02:00:30] <MootPoot> but tbh I think its the wrong question as well
[02:01:01] <PancakeMatsuri> are VN displays good at all?
[02:01:02] <emmeka> gotta miss the good old days when displays blasted electrons directly into your eyeballs with zero lag
[02:01:13] <MootPoot> the question should not be "how much can the eye see" but "how much hz on a digital display can you crank out before 90% or more people fail to notice the difference in a double blind test"
[02:02:00] <MootPoot> you could probably technically get somebody to notice a speck at 250hz or even 500, but why bother for such a minor detail
[02:02:28] <MootPoot> Its like chasing after screen resolution after you've already hit retina for your particular display size/viewing distance
[02:03:34] <Disconsented> LCD's dont have issues with 'artifacting' thats an issue of video compression
[02:03:40] <Disconsented> Tearing is solved with VRR
[02:03:42] <Bco1981> damn... obs is limited to 60fps
[02:03:56] <Disconsented> Ghosting is mostly an issue of panel type but that's solved as well
[02:04:01] <emmeka> Disconsented nah, there's inherent artifacting in the way digital graphics are processed
[02:04:23] <emmeka> compression artifacts are only one of many
[02:04:24] <MootPoot> collect the artefacts
[02:04:36] <Disconsented> No
[02:04:42] <Disconsented> Just no
[02:05:04] <Disconsented> That happens well before the LCD can display anything
[02:05:32] <MootPoot> does it matter if its a IPS / TN etc
[02:05:40] <emmeka> yes, but it's inherent to digital displays.
[02:05:54] <Disconsented> It has nothing to do with the display
[02:06:00] <MootPoot> sony please send me a 4k CRT
[02:06:09] <emmeka> it has to do with the fact that the information being transmitted to the display is digital.
[02:06:13] <Disconsented> You get artifacts on analog displays 
[02:06:20] <emmeka> you do, but for different reasons.
[02:06:25] <emmeka> NTSC artifacting and shit
[02:06:29] <Disconsented> Its not the display, its the source
[02:06:43] <MootPoot> speaking of, what happened to that one maker of CRT tcs
[02:06:44] <MootPoot> tvs
[02:06:50] <MootPoot> did they shut down as well
[02:06:52] <emmeka> one maker?
[02:06:53] <emmeka> Sony?
[02:07:23] <emmeka> afaik, Sony Trinitrons dropped off the face of the earth sometime shortly before 2010.
[02:07:41] <MootPoot> wasen't there some holdover russian or african company that still made them for their local market
[02:07:45] <MootPoot> or am I losing my shit
[02:07:54] <MootPoot> emmeka: my family still owns a sony trinitron 
[02:07:54] <emmeka> well, how would I know.
[02:08:06] <MootPoot> although it is 3000km away lul
[02:08:08] <emmeka> MootPoot check the model. There's a few of them worth good money right now.
[02:08:42] <MootPoot> I think its in my closet in our second home
[02:09:14] <emmeka> Sony made a few late model Trinitrons which actually had PVM grade shit on the inside, they're considered the best gaming TVs ever made (that is, for standard def...)
[02:09:26] <MootPoot> tbh I think its from like
[02:09:27] <MootPoot> hmm
[02:09:32] <MootPoot> 98 or something?
[02:09:39] <emmeka> ah, nah, too old.
[02:09:41] <MootPoot> I remember playing in with with my ps2
[02:09:44] <MootPoot> and wii
[02:09:47] <MootPoot> it had color 
[02:10:41] <MootPoot> but yeah, I'm fine with my fancy, fundamentally flawed 1000 dollar gaming monitor
[02:10:50] <MootPoot> not into retro as it is
[02:10:54] <MootPoot> dont have room for that shit
[02:12:32] <MootPoot> every time I got into retro or got something old
[02:12:36] <MootPoot> I got it up and running
[02:12:43] <MootPoot> and I was like "damn this is cool" for about 5 min
[02:12:49] <MootPoot> then I realized I could barely do anything on it
[02:12:55] <MootPoot> and went back to my main pc
[02:16:22] <Bco1981> omg even 60 looks choppy now that i managed to record 90 and 120 fps videos
[02:19:09] <Bco1981> 60 vs 90 big difference... if you have a monitor can do more then 60hz
[02:19:16] <Bco1981> 90 vs 120 is hard to tell
[02:20:08] <lastonestanding> what is the point of 75hz monitors?
[02:20:25] <Bco1981> better refreshrate then 60 ?
[02:20:47] <MootPoot> its a good compromise
[02:21:02] <MootPoot> mainly the 75hz monitors are 75hz due to 2 reasons
[02:21:10] <MootPoot> freesync afaik does its job at 75hz
[02:21:28] <MootPoot> within a specific fps range, 60 to 75 or something
[02:21:46] <MootPoot> that, and also it barely costs anything more to make a 75hz monitor over a 60
[02:21:48] <MootPoot> so why not

[04:06:07] <PancakeMatsuri> I've been doing some boring shit with Wordpress. But because it's for my business, I'm fine with it.
[04:06:10] *** Joins: Mr_Misery (~weechat@2400:1a00:b1e0:e2c3:9e2:2e2:3f17:1ec9)
[04:06:23] <Nanobot> I confessed to someone over video chat, but I was too loud, so she turned me down.
[04:06:45] <MootPoot> at least she didnt force update you into reality
[04:06:48] <senti> Nanobot, I'm sorry brother
[04:07:22] <senti> Nanobot, you tried, I didn't even do that, over these many years
[04:07:33] <Nanobot> senti: I was just making a volume joke.
[04:07:44] <Nanobot> I've never asked anyone out before.
[04:07:46] <senti> oh, uh, I feel stupid
[04:07:57] <senti> Nanobot: then you're like me
[04:08:00] <ButterNoodle> me either Nanobot...
[04:08:14] <senti> ButterNoodle: I like you daughter though
[04:08:20] <ButterNoodle> a cute girl at the farm supply store asked me for my number earlier
[04:08:39] <ButterNoodle> I blushed as she confirmed my name for the rewards on my account
[04:09:11] <senti> I don't believe you butter
[04:09:44] <senti> I can't get a girl to like me, and I'm actually good looking
[04:09:53] <MootPoot> woah, same

[04:13:26] <senti> MootPoot: thanks for being my bud
[04:13:33] <MootPoot> Now I think I'm in a bad spot where I subconciously think every relationship is transactional
[04:13:42] <MootPoot> a business transaction
[04:13:42] <ButterNoodle> they are
[04:13:57] <MootPoot> Is that normal
[04:13:58] <MootPoot> idk
[04:14:01] <ButterNoodle> yea
[04:14:17] <senti> It's no transactional with me. It's just my soul and your soul
[04:14:24] <senti> fuck your money
[04:14:34] <MootPoot> well
[04:14:41] <MootPoot> by transactional I dont mean like
[04:14:47] <MootPoot> enjoying each others company
[04:15:05] <MootPoot> I mean like both sides have something they want to extract from the other person and bail
[04:15:05] <senti> no, join me in a place where we are both lost
[04:15:16] <senti> I'd like to converse in hell with you
[04:15:46] <MootPoot> And then I dont really go out and try to talk to randoms
[04:15:46] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea sometimes that is enjoying company
[04:15:48] <MootPoot> becasue I think
[04:16:01] <MootPoot> "what could this person possibly get from me"
[04:16:05] <senti> MootPoot: do I qualify as a random
[04:16:09] <MootPoot> I dont have money or skill to give
[04:16:34] <senti> MootPoot: I don't want to be a random!
[04:16:45] <senti> help

[04:21:15] <MootPoot> how the fuck do you talk to people
[04:21:33] <senti> drink first
[04:21:43] <senti> I have lots of whisky
[04:22:08] <MootPoot> I already have adhd
[04:22:22] <MootPoot> I dont think a person like me should drink alcohol
[04:22:22] <MootPoot> lol
[04:22:31] <senti> MootPoot: my cousin shared Concerta with me
[04:22:42] <senti> I felt more alive than I ever did
[04:22:48] <MootPoot> I've been told people on adhd tend to respond to addictive substances easily
[04:23:04] <senti> I wrecked my math test, on concerta
[04:23:05] <MootPoot> good thing the most addctive thing I've ever used is coffee
[04:23:47] <senti> I guess I"m adhd
[04:23:57] <senti> I take quick to stuff
[04:24:17] <senti> fuck me
[04:24:43] <MootPoot> fortunately in my case I'm considered mild
[04:24:54] <senti> I'm not
[04:25:02] <senti> I'm a wildly messed up person
[04:25:12] <MootPoot> but anyway, supposedly people with adhd respond to certain stimuli and get addicted faster
[04:25:25] <MootPoot> brain dopamine is either too low or way too high
[04:25:59] <senti> dopamine is currency
[04:26:29] <listen_ers> still sounds dismissive. if two people dont have some weird filter theyll communicate everything clearly

[05:30:39] <amigojapan> MootPoot: thanks for the link
[05:30:41] <Urchin[emacs]> from the LN prologue: "My brash behavior around the house hadn’t won anyone over. I was the sort of guy who’d bang on the walls and floors to get people’s attention without leaving my room. On the day of the funeral, I was halfway through jerking off, my body arched in the air, when my brothers and sisters barged into my room in their mourning garb and delivered their letter formally disowning me. When I ignored it, my younger brother
[05:30:42] <Urchin[emacs]> smashed my computer—which I valued more than myself—with a wooden bat. Meanwhile, my older brother, the one with a black belt in karate, stormed over in a blind rage and beat the crap out of me."
[05:30:55] <Urchin[emacs]> "What the hell had I even done wrong? All I did was skip out on our parents’ funeral so I could spank it to uncensored loli porn."
[05:31:02] <amigojapan> senti: sorry I was sleeping earlier
[05:35:03] <MootPoot> wait

[05:35:19] <MootPoot> and his siblings

[07:15:13] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: licensing, and band space
[07:15:45] <ButterNoodle> look at how many concurrent users you can get in the small licensed space a mobile phone carrier uses
[07:16:15] <amigojapan> I have no idea
[07:16:47] <ButterNoodle> I mean you can thats the reason
[07:17:00] <amigojapan> Oh
[07:17:14] <ButterNoodle> and mobile phones use to work like that in the past.. on conversation per slice of the spectrum
[07:17:39] <ButterNoodle> until cdma/tmda systems were properly implemented
[07:18:04] <ButterNoodle> but in 1995 no one expected more than a few dozen phone users to be in a 1 mile radius

[07:20:51] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: mobile phones are really radios. Expensive fee ones
[07:22:11] <ButterNoodle> more than that now.. they are wireless IP devices

[07:24:17] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: so well 4g remain in the not populated areas?
[07:24:50] <amigojapan> Will*
[07:24:51] <ButterNoodle> the g is just generation - its a set of protocols and infrastructure
[07:25:27] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: but I don't want my 4g phone to be obsolete
[07:25:52] <ButterNoodle> they design this stuff so its compatible for the most part and backward compatible so they can be cheap in rural areas where there isnt any ROI on deploying the newer tech
[07:25:56] <ButterNoodle> well
[07:26:08] <ButterNoodle> they can obsolete the old protocols and force upgrades
[07:26:37] <ButterNoodle> its not good for business
[07:26:43] <amigojapan> I hate forcing upgrdes
[07:27:02] <ButterNoodle> I mean if its a 20 year old phone.. its time to upgrade
[07:27:20] <ButterNoodle> I would like the idea that in an emergency I could power on an old device and 911
[07:27:29] <amigojapan> Ok 20 years is good enough but not 4
[07:27:40] <ButterNoodle> but if ur phone is over 10 years old I think it wont work
[07:27:47] <ButterNoodle> and what about cheap phones..
[07:28:21] <ButterNoodle> 5g requirements for all the different radios and software -probably licenses also- will drive up the hardware price too
[07:28:39] <ButterNoodle> yea 4 is bullshit tbh
[07:28:53] <ButterNoodle> I dont want to HAVE to upgrade every 4 years
[07:29:08] <amigojapan> Yeah 20 years is half my life. That is good enough
[07:29:23] <ButterNoodle> buying a $1000 phone every 4 years is painful
[07:29:35] <amigojapan> Yeah
[07:30:03] <ButterNoodle> so effectively with carriers doing the payment plans on phones, they rope you into a higher bill
[07:31:23] <ButterNoodle> I want to upgrade because I have a need for a better device, or my old one has failed - not because of planned obsolescence
[07:31:53] <amigojapan> Exactly ButterNoodle 
[07:33:08] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: do you know someone had invented an ever paying light bulb, but the light bulb companies forced a maximum life of 1000 days?

[13:46:39] <Berlin36> While Bash is a good shell, Fish is better. It makes up for a lot of the shortcomings Bash and other shells have. The auto-complete function is a lifesaver, and the robust configuration options are a welcome addition. The shell is very fast and light on it's feet.

[17:09:26] <snake> don't cross the streams like that it's confusing to people who might be reading
[17:09:42] <KatrinValerie> Your coworker just was weirded out by your issues with eyecontact and then started being mean to you
[17:09:51] <KatrinValerie> which is really really low of her
[17:10:14] <snake> KatrinValerie, i dont remember the bit about the eye contact specifically
[17:10:16] <KatrinValerie> snake: I think it's not fair that they do not take your autism into account and just assume your being creepy
[17:10:31] <DunceCotus> its okay to be creepily autistic
[17:10:32] <snake> let me tell you an example
[17:10:34] <KatrinValerie> snake: Could be that I misremember
[17:11:01] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: nah, but you need to adress these things directly, because an autistic person might not realise they are being creepy
[17:11:26] <DunceCotus> isn't that subjective
[17:11:29] <KatrinValerie> and when you don't catch the hint you are a creep
[17:11:42] <snake> on a meeting the girl i wanted to be friends with was saying how she wanted a dog but didn't want to feed them, they want just a friend with a dog who can come over and let her kids play with the dog
[17:11:48] <DunceCotus> cr33p
[17:12:07] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: the most common reason autistic people have trouble with social interactions, is that we can't "read the room"
[17:12:09] <snake> KatrinValerie, this was after we decided to just speak professionally to each other (so i should say i gave up on wanting to be her friend)
[17:12:40] <snake> KatrinValerie, after the meeting, my manager's ranking officer came in and asked if i was still thinking about getting a dog
[17:13:01] <snake> that's like bait

[17:13:45] <snake> yeah so don't just say i got in trouble with females, they were players

[18:39:30] <HubertFarnsworth> Do you even know what mentally retarded is?
[18:39:54] <Omega037> This seems to not be talking about anime right now
[18:39:55] <Sadale> I mean he could use that word if he want. But most users in this channel doesn't like this word. So it's safer to avoid using this word.

[18:40:35] <Sadale> My advise would be avoid using that word because the users here simply don't like it. Instead, use replacement words like people being dumb, being stupid, etc.
[18:40:43] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: Nah, that's an insult to people who actually suffer from disability
[18:40:53] <KatrinValerie> newbie2021: it's a derogatory term for a disabled person
[18:40:55] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: IRC is already open source social media
[18:41:15] <Sadale> Meanwhile there are other comnmunities that welcome use of this kind of words. Based on my observation, this channel isn't one of those communities.
[18:41:23] <KatrinValerie> People with cognitive impairment are people too and we should respect them and their human dignity.
[18:41:24] <Omega037> Now I have a general rule with old slides that I keep stuff with people, but random pictures of flowers and boats and landscapes are meh
[18:41:40] <Omega037> This time it is a bit harder because I find 1970s Japan imagery to be fascinating

[18:43:02] <Omega037> Like I have no context beyond "picture of a 1975 Japanese city taken from some height"
[18:43:19] <Omega037> Picture of Noh or Bunraku or something being performed in 1975

[18:44:24] <Omega037> Honestly even with people, 75% of the time I have no clue who the people are
[18:44:33] <Omega037> Probably business associates who died years ago
[18:44:47] <Omega037> The problem is that it takes me time to digitize

[18:46:00] <HubertFarnsworth> how are you? how is the family?
[18:46:16] <Omega037> pretty good?
[18:46:36] <Omega037> My daughter had a cold but seems to be better tnow
[18:47:04] <Omega037> Still decided to keep her out of sunday school this week since he fever only broke the day before
[18:47:19] <HubertFarnsworth> that's better
[18:47:37] <HubertFarnsworth> do the kids have to go to school or they have online classes?
[18:48:04] <KatrinValerie> newbie2021: so you are not really new to #anime? may I inquire what your old nickname on freenode was?
[18:48:12] <KatrinValerie> You do not have to answer, I am merly curious.
[18:48:21] <Omega037> They are in school
[18:48:27] <Omega037> We did virtual last year
[18:48:39] <Omega037> For sunday school, they go into the Synagogue
[18:48:59] <HubertFarnsworth> I see.
[18:49:01] <Omega037> Anyways
[18:50:35] <amigojapan> Omega037: Sunday school? That sounds like a Christian thing
[18:51:18] <KatrinValerie> Meow meow
[18:51:53] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Christianity merly copied that
[18:52:03] <KatrinValerie> We were not really original
[18:52:11] <KatrinValerie> It started out as a fan fiction
[18:53:28] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: copied it from what?
[18:55:29] <Bco1981> steamdeck specs, Software: SteamOS 3.0 (Arch-based)
[18:56:25] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I don't like rolling releases like arch
[18:57:08] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: From the jews, we even stole their lore
[18:57:10] <amigojapan> Bco1981: does it support vr?
[18:57:46] <Bco1981> amigojapan: there is a video of a guy that got his valve index headset to work on it.
[18:58:20] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: ah maybe Hebrew school yeah
[18:58:21] <Bco1981> the current downloadable steamOS for pc is based on debian8
[18:59:11] <amigojapan> Bco1981: that is much better
[18:59:23] <newbie2021> Do you guys plan to play Morrowind when VR will be real deal? I am waiting for that time
[18:59:49] <Bco1981> "when VR will be real deal"... bruh... where have you been ?
[19:00:12] <amigojapan> I only want to play vrchat
[19:00:39] <newbie2021> Bco1981: so you think that VR is real deal now?
[19:01:09] <amigojapan> newbie2021: it needs to get way cheaper
[19:01:10] <Bco1981> you are not gonna get fulldive vr like SAO anytime soon.
[19:01:17] <Sadale> amigojapan, cardboard VR
[19:01:27] <Bco1981> probably not even in our lifetime.
[19:01:29] <Sadale> Rich people like Bco1981 is willing for afford a VR headset :3
[19:01:36] <Bco1981> Sadale: try 6
[19:01:37] <newbie2021> you lack imagination so bad Bco1981. Your standarts are low. 
[19:01:43] <amigojapan> Sadale: it does not work very well
[19:01:46] <Sadale> Bco1981, What did you mean by 6?
[19:01:52] <Bco1981> 6 vr headsets
[19:02:18] <omero> just finished Black Clover ... wow... now Im already feeling in withdrawal mode
[19:02:29] <Bco1981> Sadale: 1 oculus DK2, 3 oculus rift cv1, 1 valve index, 1 playstation VR
[19:02:32] <Sadale> Bco1981, did you mean that you've tried six VR headsets in your lifetime?
[19:02:36] <Bco1981> i own
[19:02:36] <Sadale> ah. you rich
[19:02:48] <amigojapan> Hi omero. Too bad I will probably sleep soon
[19:02:57] <Sadale> Bco1981, damn I wish I'm as rich as you.
[19:03:05] <omero> amigojapan: glad you are all good there!
[19:03:05] * Sadale poor car 3:
[19:03:10] * Sadale poor cat* 3:
[19:03:39] <Bco1981> well two of the CV1's are backups for when my main CV1 dies.
[19:03:45] <Omega037> amigojapan, Sunday is not Shabbat
[19:03:57] <newbie2021> become rich to play videogames... Idk. Is that what humankind has become? It's a nonstop masturbation.
[19:03:57] <Omega037> Well, not for us Jews
[19:03:58] <omero> not much following the news but I gather it was a pretty bad event
[19:04:03] <Bco1981> since Fuckbook dicided to cancel the best vr headset made to date.
[19:04:18] <amigojapan> omero: I am trapped in a town two hours by train from my house. The earthquake caused a main transformer of Japan rail to explode
[19:04:20] <Sadale> Actually to me it's not quite about lack of money. I could totally afford that if I want to. It's just that I'm being frugal. Plus I don't have the space for VR in my home :<
[19:04:31] <Omega037> Jews must have their weekend school when it isn't Shabbat
[19:04:44] <Bco1981> Sadale: yeah... need that space.
[19:04:52] <Sadale> living with my parents >_<
[19:04:59] <Omega037> Christians don't do the same level of Shabbat resting (though there are blue laws and such), so they also do Sunday School
[19:05:00] <amigojapan> Omega037: ok you meant Hebrew school
[19:05:01] <Sadale> 30m-sq apartment. 4 persons.
[19:05:08] <omero> amigojapan: been reading the backlog here... that's all the news I got... but I feel for you. sincerely
[19:05:09] <Bco1981> i kinda do. just in the apartment nextdoor.
[19:05:15] <Omega037> Hebrew School is usually weekday afternoons
[19:05:15] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: try tower of god
[19:05:31] <amigojapan> Thanks omero 
[19:05:34] <Omega037> When preparing for Bar Mitzvah and such
[19:05:52] <Omega037> I think my temple starts Hebrew School around 3rd grade
[19:05:58] <omero> amigojapan: as you probably know... my country is also suffering those kind of ... events... not as often as there where you live...
[19:06:17] <Omega037> finishes when they hit 13 (7th grade) + confirmation class the year after that
[19:06:27] <omero> HubertFarnsworth: will check that one! thanks for the clue ;)
[19:06:30] <amigojapan> Ouch omero good luck for us both
[19:07:28] <newbie2021> HubertFarnsworth: you mean that korean manga? but it sucks
[19:07:51] <emmeka> newbie2021 *manwha
[19:07:53] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: I wouldn't recommend the anime. The anime is good but missed a lot of subtle details compared to manwha. At start it is bit boring with not so good art and slow plot but wait for it, it will get better.
[19:07:55] <emmeka> manga is Japanese!
[19:08:13] <omero> oh... that would be a problem for me then
[19:08:29] <HubertFarnsworth> newbie2021: well some like it and some don't, to each their own
[19:08:31] <emmeka> I hear lots of good things about Tower of God, but I haven't gotten around to it. To many ongoing manga for me rn anyway.
[19:08:44] <HubertFarnsworth> nyanpasu o/ emmeka 
[19:09:22] <omero> Ive stumbled on short anime... astra lost in space.
[19:09:32] <newbie2021> Did you guys read Blame!?
[19:09:35] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: It gets quite from season 2. The trouble is our mc is simp at start.
[19:09:35] <omero> per aspera ad astra is latin
[19:09:46] <HubertFarnsworth> quite good*
[19:10:01] <omero> it captured my attention
[19:10:06] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: then you can watch anime for season 1 of manwha
[19:10:28] * omero is open to suggestions!
[19:10:55] <omero> I was also intrigued by Dr. Stone... but ... mmmm... Im dubious
[19:10:58] <snake> amigojapan, i know some people got injured because of the earthquake and many people cannot use the train, but i feel like it'd make life more interesting when something goes wrong occasionally
[19:11:03] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: too many? what others are there?
[19:11:16] <snake> (tho im contradicting myself just a little since i almost had a meltdown because my car was in the shop for a week)
[19:11:20] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth what other ongoing manga are there right now?
[19:11:33] <newbie2021> emmeka: boruto
[19:11:43] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I mean that I'm currently reading too many ongoing series to pick up another right this second
[19:11:46] <emmeka> maybe in winter
[19:11:47] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: I mean what other ongoing manga that you like?
[19:12:10] <omero> besides... things with 'god' and variation... kind of ... keep me afar
[19:12:11] <snake>  emmeka i like "mother of the goddess' dormitory
[19:12:16] <snake> "
[19:12:24] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: recommend me some when you have time
[19:12:32] <amigojapan> snake: hmm. Sure it's nice to change things up a bit from time to time
[19:12:33] <omero> I am not in very good terms with such entities
[19:12:38] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth tonnes of crap, mainly yuri and BL
[19:12:45] <MootPoot> are you god omero 
[19:12:48] <emmeka> so probably not to your preferences
[19:13:00] <omero> MootPoot: I am ancient.
[19:13:09] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: wow, how do you know that?
[19:13:09] <snake> MootPoot, have you watched mother of the goddess' dormitory?
[19:13:16] <snake> (has anyone here?)
[19:13:29] <snake> its harem
[19:13:32] <MootPoot> oh that
[19:13:35] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't mean it's wrong but you are right emmeka 
[19:13:36] <MootPoot> yeah I watched a few
[19:13:40] <snake> oic
[19:13:45] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth because you asked me for a recommendation based on the premise that I would read Tower of God
[19:14:03] <snake> MootPoot, i used your advice at least
[19:14:08] <snake> used MAL to find an anime to watch
[19:14:18] <HubertFarnsworth> ah, I like romance/shojo manga too emmeka 
[19:14:20] <amigojapan> Dang chat gets interesting when I need to go to sleep. Good night everyone
[19:14:26] <omero> and I am a professional sinner too
[19:14:27] <snake> amigojapan, goodnight
[19:14:37] <amigojapan> Ty snake 
[19:14:39] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth for ongoing shoujo, I'd say the best thing right now is probably Yona of the Dawn
[19:14:54] <emmeka> which is appealing to action fans as well
[19:14:57] <amigojapan> Oyasumi HubertFarnsworth 
[19:14:57] <omero> amigojapan: have dreams of all colors!
[19:14:58] <HubertFarnsworth> I should catch up with that
[19:15:02] <emmeka> it's significantly more violent than your median shoujo
[19:15:05] <HubertFarnsworth> oyasumi amigojapan 
[19:15:09] <newbie2021> Do you guys play RTS games?

[19:16:27] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: dude, I know yona. I watched the anime.
[19:16:51] <emmeka> it's unfortunate where the anime ends off, but that does provide a good reason to pick up the manga
[19:17:01] *** Quits: digin4 (~digin4@user/digin4) (Client Quit)
[19:17:10] <omero> newbie2021: it was a test. I hate acronyms. like Real Time Strategy
[19:17:25] <HubertFarnsworth> I picked up and forgot to read
[19:18:04] <omero> there are a few good ones actually free... and quite as ancient as me, newbie2021 
[19:18:42] <omero> what RTS has to do with anime, it eludes me tho... but here is general chat, right?
[19:18:55] <Sadale> This chat is about everything but anime xD
[19:19:21] <omero> oh and when RTS is not meaning Real Time Strategy ... please forgive my dumbness.
[19:19:31] <Sadale> It is. RTS game is real time strategy game.
[19:20:03] <newbie2021> omero: good old days when RTS were popular. Now they are gone :'(
[19:20:12] <omero> I used to play RTS games intensively
[19:20:14] <emmeka> newbie2021 I play a lot of Age of Empires still, even though it's ancient
[19:20:16] <Sadale> If I make a dollar for every time someone talks about anime here, I wouldn't make a dime after staying here for years :P
[19:20:36] <omero> newbie2021: Battle of Wesnoth. have you played it?
[19:20:49] <HubertFarnsworth> the only romance manga I am reading rn is namaikizakari

[19:21:02] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth it's motw rn!
[19:21:02] <newbie2021> omero: i didn't. 
[19:21:04] * omero yes that was another test
[19:21:06] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: My austrian gf is a huge AoE fanatic
[19:21:16] <HubertFarnsworth> ohh
[19:21:20] <emmeka> newbie2021 yeah, I did. I have that definitive edition and AoE II
[19:21:21] <HubertFarnsworth> who picked that?
[19:21:31] <emmeka> they're making a new one actually
[19:21:32] <HubertFarnsworth> me, lol
[19:21:37] *** Joins: itok (sid418430@id-418430.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[19:21:38] <emmeka> there's going to be an AoE 4
[19:21:55] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: I used to read horimiya before it was popular now with anime
[19:21:55] <newbie2021> emmeka: yeah, i know. And i don't like it. Good old sprite graphics rule. I don't like 3D
[19:22:09] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I *love* Horimiya
[19:22:14] <emmeka> gets me right in the kokoro
[19:22:22] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: same, me too, I love horimiya!!
[19:22:46] <emmeka> newbie2021 AoE III is pretty good though
[19:23:05] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: have you read l-dk?
[19:23:14] <emmeka> I don't think so
[19:23:23] <newbie2021> emmeka: you play against people? Are you good?
[19:23:52] <emmeka> I play against people sometimes, usually my wife, who's played longer than I have. I'm reasonably good, but there are better.
[19:24:32] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: the manga is completed, try it, it is good read
[19:24:37] <HubertFarnsworth> good romance
[19:24:50] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I'm waiting for the official English release to be finished
[19:24:54] <emmeka> then I'll just binge it
[19:25:00] <newbie2021> so we will not see continuation of Berserk? 
[19:25:35] <omero> but you have also ... 
[19:25:48] <emmeka> newbie2021 Berserk's author is suffering from the incurable form of writer's block known as death
[19:26:13] <newbie2021> but maybe some other mangaka will do the work
[19:26:46] <emmeka> it still wouldn't be the same manga, though. I mean they might spin it off to another mangaka to finish the story as a sequel series.

[19:27:41] <newbie2021> the most exciting manga in my life was Gantz
[19:28:46] <KatrinValerie> The ending to gantz was really disappointing
[19:28:51] <omero> newbie2021: warzone and widelands would qualify as RTS
[19:29:00] <newbie2021> KatrinValerie: yeah
[19:29:06] <omero> played both intensively
[19:29:16] <klaxa> depending on your definition counterstrike is an rts
[19:29:24] <omero> warzone is more modern
[19:29:31] <newbie2021> omero: you play only open source games?
[19:29:45] <omero> newbie2021: affirmative
[19:30:26] <omero> I play games that can run on my old rig...
[19:30:33] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha Hen | Episode: 1
[19:30:42] <emmeka> I've played a bit of Warzone 2100
[19:30:45] <newbie2021> omero: there are open source engines for proprietary games. Guys are making open source engine for Heroes II
[19:30:48] <emmeka> it does run well on shit PCs
[19:31:06] <emmeka> but being good at that game is all wrote memorization of the research tree
[19:32:06] <omero> emmeka: I can stand by that ... my hardware is ... rusty ;)
[19:33:00] <newbie2021> omero: There is an open source engine for X-COM and also open source clones.

[19:35:25] <newbie2021> omero: don't you use Palemoon and others browsers. 
[19:35:42] <Sadale> I couldn't play anything computationally expensive back then. Now that I can with my mid-end computer.
[19:35:42] <omero> nope
[19:35:55] <omero> its by choice.
[19:36:19] <omero> I do not understand this trend of enforcing one to ... update.
[19:36:34] <omero> it doesnt make sense to me

[19:38:18] <newbie2021> omero: so. How do you secure your old soft? It's full of security holes, i guess
[19:38:20] <omero> its just ... wrong.
[19:38:49] <omero> sure.
[19:39:13] <omero> like dating a girl you have met like 1 minute earlier... its ... dangerous.
[19:39:37] <omero> how do you handle that, newbie2021 ?
[19:39:46] <newbie2021> omero: handle what?
[19:41:15] <omero> nevermind. but the concept remains.

[19:51:06] <omero> the characters... 
[19:51:17] <omero> thats my kind of things
[19:51:26] <newbie2021> Yeah.
[19:51:42] <newbie2021> omero: so, are you from Japan?
[19:51:52] <omero> nope
[19:52:10] <omero> I am from a different part of the world
[19:52:24] <omero> but I appreciate the stories.
[19:53:10] <omero> from all parts of the world...
[19:54:24] <HubertFarnsworth> I have shown Laputa to my niece last week
[19:54:55] <omero> in my country, we also have a strong tradition of 'animated' stories... they arent called anime... but the similarities are ... there
[19:55:36] <omero> seems like ... this similarities exist everywhere.
[19:55:59] <Sadale> korea?
[19:56:38] <newbie2021> omero: is Gundam 0079 for kids? Story is pretty dumb, right? Like Transformers
[19:56:43] <omero> HubertFarnsworth: if you think when laputa was made... its amazing... the whole thing is just... a masterpiece in storytelling
[19:57:22] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, it is like a fairy tale
[19:57:52] <omero> newbie2021: mmm... I wouldnt say so. no. it can be enjoyed by kids... but even now... its pretty much ... survived the 40+ years
[19:58:28] <Urchin[emacs]> newbie2021: it's a bit more mature than that
[19:58:36] <newbie2021> HubertFarnsworth: omero i like more smart stuff like Patlabor. Patlabor movie is pretty good. Didn't watch series
[19:58:38] <omero> and gundam... the original... its like old wine. a good aged one.
[19:59:04] <Urchin[emacs]> newbie2021: it's really a war drama
[19:59:16] <omero> its mecha stuff? yes. but its not about that at all...
[19:59:19] <Urchin[emacs]> newbie2021: also, war in the pocket is good
[19:59:28] <emmeka> I'd still say that Nausicaa is probably the best manga ever made, even given its age. the movie is more like a teaser to the whole story.
[19:59:32] <HubertFarnsworth> newbie2021: I am not into mecha anime/manga.
[19:59:52] <Urchin[emacs]> newbie2021: war in the pocket is a lot like early vinland saga
[20:00:15] <HubertFarnsworth> I love Vinland Saga
[20:00:18] <omero> oh the gundams are so good in general... some series arent holding that well but ... its a very complex ... universe/context
[20:00:28] <omero> its like the matsumoto stuff
[20:01:00] <omero> that is anime, folks
[20:01:20] <HubertFarnsworth> the characters and the story telling in vinland saga, haven't seen something like that in long time
[20:01:29] <omero> some are so much brilliant stories with so much layers of complexity
[20:01:34] <Urchin[emacs]> early scenes in Nausicaa are some of the best representation of science (especially Ecology) ever
[20:01:37] <newbie2021> Urchin[emacs]: Thanks. Will check that out, eventually
[20:02:16] <newbie2021> HubertFarnsworth: do you mean manga or anime?
[20:02:36] <HubertFarnsworth> I have watched anime and reading manga too
[20:04:40] <omero> Urchin[emacs]: I never got around to like Char's counter attack in the gundams... I simply cannot ... understand
[20:05:27] <newbie2021> Batman Animated series aged very good btw
[20:05:35] <newbie2021> Classic
[20:05:41] <omero> but I liked a lot some of the later ... like 0083, or say... SEED. I liked seed very much. including destiny...
[20:06:12] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:06:15] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] you should read the manga. The movie's story only covers about like 1/5th of the manga's, and then rushes to a different ending.
[20:06:26] <emmeka> and the manga was done by Miyazaki himself
[20:06:34] <HubertFarnsworth> newbie2021: true, I still have it and watch the fav episodes occasionally. Great plots and scripts.
[20:06:40] <emmeka> when he was still green
[20:06:50] <omero> gundam series are... a real nightmare to grasp... as a whole... different writers, different animators... different VAs... 
[20:07:13] <newbie2021> HubertFarnsworth: you have DVD or what? There is BluRay edition few years ago
[20:07:30] <HubertFarnsworth> newbie2021: nah, pirated/downloaded
[20:07:41] <omero> tomino and matsumoto tho... remain legends.
[20:07:47] <newbie2021> omero: yeah. Like some others anime franchises
[20:08:11] <HubertFarnsworth> newbie2021: one of my fav is the Riddler episode. 
[20:08:16] <omero> they are masters. one either loves them... or hates them.
[20:08:38] <newbie2021> HubertFarnsworth: i like that character.  Ventriloquist
[20:08:51] <Miyukii> is gundam worth getting into if you're a slow watcher?
[20:08:59] <Miyukii> how at one point there were 2 seasons airing at the same time put me off even further
[20:09:48] <omero> Miyukii: when you want to start, start with the original 0079 (shorthand) ... watch a few episodes. then decide
[20:10:10] <Miyukii> the old ones are the best?
[20:10:35] <omero> unicorn. is ... capturing the original in full.
[20:10:35] <Sxem> im watching all the dubbed gundams
[20:10:36] <emmeka> Miyukii "Gundam" is less one cohesive series than a brand name under which several different anime exist
[20:10:43] <HubertFarnsworth> newbie2021: try Vinland Saga though. It isn't like any other anime. The characters have depth.

[20:10:57] <Sxem> im up to 2015 Mobile Suit Gundam - Iron-Blooded Orphans S01-02
[20:11:02] <emmeka> there's multiple Gundam timelines, from multiple studios, that vary wildly in quality
[20:11:03] <Miyukii> good thing since I'm too biased for old stuff anyway
[20:11:18] <omero> but I wouldnt have appreciated unicorn when I didnt watched the previous series
[20:11:20] <HubertFarnsworth> I see
[20:11:41] <emmeka> Miyukii with Gundam, just watch the original
[20:11:50] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: I remember you now. You're the Gundam dude, aren't you?
[20:11:51] <omero> yes emmeka ... that is actually what makes it good... I know its confusing... but... still... 
[20:12:09] <omero> HubertFarnsworth: lol
[20:12:12] <Miyukii> emmeka yeah even from afar it seems like they let anyone that wanted have a shot at it
[20:12:15] <emmeka> Miyukii if you like the original, watch the rest in that timeline, if you liked all of that, try the others.
[20:12:18] <MootPoot> There are some good spinoff gundams
[20:12:31] <MootPoot> You can try without getting into the whole universe
[20:12:39] <omero> there are several very excellent spinoffs, yes

[20:13:35] <MootPoot> Thunderbolt is good but idkwtf is happening
[20:13:36] <HubertFarnsworth> we all love eva
[20:13:47] <emmeka> I don't really care for Eva.
[20:13:55] * emmeka is lynched
[20:13:55] <HubertFarnsworth> no way!
[20:14:08] <snake> yeah i like thunderbolt (usb-c 3.0?)
[20:14:12] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: are you joking?
[20:14:22] <MootPoot> Usb 4 is thunderbolt snake not 3
[20:14:27] <snake> ty
[20:14:34] <omero> oh boys ... who hates DD hasnt a clue about ... how a good story HAS to include some ... interesting action (aside the bloodshed and the mecha)
[20:14:34] <MootPoot> 40gbps
[20:14:41] <snake> sugoi desu yo!
[20:14:44] <emmeka> Eva's one of those things that's too far up its own ass, it has redeeming qualities and is certainly watcheable and End of Evangelion is definitely one of the best anime of the 90s aesthetically
[20:15:29] <emmeka> but the original series just totally shits the bed on production value towards the end, it's basically a failure of directing
[20:15:31] <omero> besides... I am not immune to some good romance. yeah.. war is ugly and stuff... but... war and peace is a masterpiece
[20:15:52] <omero> I know its not anime... but ... tolstoy wasnt an idiot ;)
[20:17:13] <omero> Война и мир. if one was curious... its about love, war and ... life.
[20:17:35] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I don't hate it, and I wouldn't say it's bad, and I recognize the role that it played in developing anime as a medium and why that's important and for that reason alone think everyone should watch it. But I don't think Eva is actually a good anime.
[20:18:07] <HubertFarnsworth> wow emmeka, I can't believe it's you
[20:18:10] <omero> I never watched evangelion stuff...
[20:18:13] <emmeka> if any modern anime pulled the sort of crap at the end of production that Eva did, it would be hated on for all eternity. We even have a perfect modern example: Wonder Egg Priority.
[20:18:25] <omero> I am probably missing something there
[20:18:37] <emmeka> which is a fantastic, surreal, esoteric kind of anime for its first 2/3
[20:18:47] <omero> but evangelion sends me bad vibes in that word
[20:19:01] <emmeka> and then it totally fell apart behind the scenes, and now the OVA ending to the series has like a 5/10 on MAL
[20:19:16] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: you should watch it but it isn't for tender hearts though, very mature topics/stuff
[20:19:51] <emmeka> my recommendation for watching Eva, which gets a lot of hate, is to skip the last 2 episodes of the main series and just watch End of Evangelion.
[20:19:59] <newbie2021> omero: watch it. Pretty atmospheric. I like outside scenes. Evangelion really gives me that long teenager summer vibe. 
[20:20:03] <emmeka> there's no sense sitting through which is essentially a failure of animation
[20:20:06] <newbie2021> now summers are different...
[20:20:14] <omero> HubertFarnsworth: how so? please elaborate... because from researching... I think I would not like it 'by skin feeling'
[20:20:18] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: Eva changed me
[20:20:59] <emmeka> Shinji is definitely one of the better anime MCs of all time, I'll give it that. It still doesn't save the series from its own production failures.
[20:21:14] <newbie2021> HubertFarnsworth: "evan changed me" ... man, you must be really infantile
[20:21:27] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: I mean it deals with mature topics and has pretty dark series
[20:21:35] <HubertFarnsworth> characters*
[20:21:51] <omero> for instance. I like things like Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo
[20:22:13] <omero> short lived. but very much ... what I like. 
[20:22:41] <newbie2021> omero: there are actions scenes, there are some teenager ecchi stuff too. I like that summer vibe, though. Sunsets... Yeah
[20:22:53] <omero> also shall we mention Lone Wolf and Cub? there isnt an anime... but a manga that is a masterpiece.
[20:23:20] <newbie2021> omero: are you from Russia?

[20:27:07] <HubertFarnsworth> incredible
[20:27:10] <emmeka> I think Eva gets the sort of rep it does only because for a lot of people, especially my generation, it was the first "serious" anime they watched.
[20:27:20] <newbie2021> maybe
[20:27:38] <newbie2021> emmeka: well, no. Most anime sucks
[20:27:44] <omero> emmeka: eva being ?

[20:28:03] <omero> ok. was just to be sure :)

[20:28:48] <newbie2021> Evangelion is a real deal. It's a real science fiction, psychologic, mystical, semireligious stuff. It's a real art. Like Silent Hill franchise. There are not much stuff like this.
[20:29:25] <omero> emmeka: as said... evangelions rings some bells that I do not want to listen to... but I know this is on my side 
[20:29:53] <newbie2021> emmeka: by that i mean, that most anime is just money grabbing stuff. Just business. Evangelion is art.
[20:30:13] <emmeka> that was precisely what I just said, but ok
[20:30:39] <Miyukii> it's good but fanboys overrate it
[20:30:47] <Miyukii> as with anything above decent really
[20:30:54] <emmeka> Eva was one of the first things to reach the west which was a serious, artful, anime. It wasn't just dumb entertainment it was animation as art and commentary.
[20:30:55] <omero> ok. now we're getting a bit philosophical
[20:31:28] <newbie2021> Miyukii: why overrate? There are not much stuff like it. Serial Exp. Lane and several anime movies, that's all.
[20:31:34] <newbie2021> Except that all anime sucks
[20:31:50] <omero> thats what gundam, yamato... harlock... were.. oh yes... even ge999
[20:32:12] <omero> then the magical girls happened
[20:32:22] <emmeka> newbie2021 there are many, many many anime now like Eva, but at the time there were not.
[20:32:24] <newbie2021> emmeka: Akira was good too. Several years earlier.
[20:32:28] <omero> wow... I just had a flash... sampei!
[20:32:29] <darkwitch> newbie2021 must really enjoy things that suck
[20:32:52] <newbie2021> emmeka: "many, many, many"? are you serious? 99% of anime is shit
[20:33:09] <Miyukii> newbie2021 those are all good but fanboys just blindly praise it
[20:33:10] <omero> sampei the fisherman... dont know/remember the proper name ... but Im sure you got him
[20:33:19] <darkwitch> newbie2021, wrong. you said it all sucks, which is 100%. simple maths
[20:33:29] <Miyukii> same with lain, etc
[20:34:09] <emmeka> newbie2021 yes? there are now countless anime which, following in the spirit of Eva, use anime as surreal commentary on heavy topics.
[20:34:31] <omero> ^ that
[20:34:34] <newbie2021> emmeka: name them. I am sure that they suck
[20:34:46] <emmeka> whether or not they are good is besides the point, since I'm arguing that Eva itself isn't good.
[20:34:53] <newbie2021> he will say. "My hero academia" :D
[20:34:54] <omero> newbie2021: now that is rude
[20:35:25] <omero> I mean... if you think anime are worthless... 
[20:35:28] <HubertFarnsworth> newbie2021: why are you here when 99% anime suck?
[20:35:36] <HubertFarnsworth> :p
[20:35:44] <newbie2021> cause 1% doesn't suck

[20:37:53] <HubertFarnsworth> objectively speaking no one has seen every anime to say 99% suck

[20:40:40] <emmeka> what assumptions, you just responded by saying you'd check some of them out, this implies you haven't seen at least a significant portion of the anime I listed

[20:41:36] <emmeka> newbie2021 I'll give you a piece of advice, responding to everyone by calling them a kid or infantile or whatever just makes everyone else think that you yourself are pretty young. Which is fine and all, if you are.

[20:42:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> newbie2021: yeah, feasible but not fun.
[20:43:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's the main problem with Qubes, or rather, with VMs in general.
[20:43:17] <emmeka> anyway, you should've been able to glean my age when I said that Eva was the only/first real serious artsy anime available to my generation, at a time when you couldn't just pirate/stream all the things.
[20:43:19] <HubertFarnsworth> anyway Eva is an wonderful experience, it is a pain that will make you feel relatable, seeing yourself in all these characters, binge it when you have time omero 
[20:43:27] <newbie2021> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah, one guy from Qubes channel tried to help me. We tried for quite some time. 
[20:43:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even if Qubes moved to seL4, it'd still require a crapload of ram for VMs.
[20:43:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Native software wouldn't, but no one writes native seL4 stuff right now ;_;
[20:43:48] <omero> HubertFarnsworth: duly noted :)
[20:44:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Though, there is something about a POSIX emulation layer and porting to it.
[20:44:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It'd require static linking, but if it werks...
[20:44:37] <Urchin[emacs]> NGE was one of my first big titles before I really got into anime
[20:44:45] <omero> I actually was a bit dubious about Black Clover... but it turned out to be ... GOOD... thus I will listen to you suggestion HubertFarnsworth 
[20:46:22] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] yeah. NGE was definitely the first serious anime I watched, stepping out of some of the shounen classics
[20:46:48] <newbie2021> emmeka: well, you look quite young cause you listed animes and you thought that i will say exactly what of those animes i've watched? that was pretty stupid 
[20:47:05] <emmeka> what does that sentence even mean
[20:47:06] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: try tower of god, I can't see you not liking it
[20:47:20] <emmeka> am I the only one who can't parse that at all
[20:47:28] <omero> ^ noted that one too, HubertFarnsworth 
[20:47:37] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: maybe you are right, eva was my first mature anime
[20:48:00] <omero> we all grow. 
[20:48:09] <omero> some instad... resist.
[20:48:35] <newbie2021> most of people doesn't grow. They are 20 all their lives till death
[20:48:38] <omero> seems someone is resisting maturing and keep their inner child
[20:49:00] <darkwitch> being young is an insult, so you can not be young
[20:49:09] <Bco1981> sometimes i'm not old enough for a drivers license
[20:49:25] <Bco1981> but that does not happen when i AM driving.... much.
[20:49:49] <omero> lol
[20:49:52] <Bco1981> because getting old is... boring

[20:50:34] <HubertFarnsworth> :p
[20:50:44] <Bco1981> HubertFarnsworth: nah they go to school on their own.
[20:50:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> What is growing past physical maturity? As far as I know, the only thing that happens thereafter is decline.
[20:51:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Bco1981: it is a joke
[20:51:27] <darkwitch> you have self-driving kids
[20:51:38] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: eh, I watched Candy Candy among my first shows when it aired on TV]
[20:51:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm partly sarcastic but... there's some truth to it.
[20:51:40] <HubertFarnsworth> lol darkwitch, good one
[20:52:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A large amount of what people consider maturity is more aptly termed resignation.
[20:52:22] <newbie2021> Bco1981: only if you are infantile. Getting old is getting wise. Your thinking abilities grow and you become more efficient. Your perception of reality grows to higher level. But most people are not like that. They are just kids all their lives. And yes, it's boring for them
[20:52:38] <Bco1981> sometimes if there is no other cars on the road, i quickly turn the wheel from side to side making the car shake, and the kids tumble around on the back seat. screaming Drive properly!
[20:52:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Resigning yourself to your inability to change anything and, in your denial of that fact, trying to convince yourself you're actually satisfied with yourself and your life.
[20:53:01] <omero> noooo... candy candy? lol .. I think its like when I started to understand ... things
[20:53:07] <Urchin[emacs]> newbie2021: you sound like an edgy teenager too full of himself

[22:46:36] <MootPoot> In the start I was maintaining 200mb/s
[22:46:39] <MootPoot> then it dropped to 90
[22:46:46] <MootPoot> now its in the 1-5 range
[22:46:54] <MootPoot> ah well, not like it matters
[22:46:59] <MootPoot> this is final stage storage anyway

[22:58:14] <MootPoot> 3-5 hours to get to 2%

[22:58:27] <MootPoot> whatever, final stage, speed not important
