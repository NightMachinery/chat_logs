[00:00:02] <gilberth> That are umlauts! And equal.
[00:00:13] <aeth> <> and () are kind of off limits because as far as printing a nick, <...> followed by ...: followed by (...) are the most common ways to do it
[00:00:34] *** Quits: wallymathieu (~wallymath@81-234-151-21-no94.tbcn.telia.com) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[00:00:41] <aeth> but «...» could be OK to have in a nick extension
[00:01:00] <aeth> probably want to exclude ¿...? and can't include ¡ because ! is already excluded
[00:01:26] <aeth> in my IRCd, ¿ will be the chanop prefix (-:
[00:02:00] <gilberth> Well, I would have a problem with accepting all of Unicode. Just because someone could find a letter in a different script to make his nick look like mine and thus impose as me. Nasty.
[00:02:35] <gilberth> aeth: No devil emoji? Or a smoking gun?
[00:03:08] <aeth> You'd replace case-insensitive with unicode-normalized, with the additional case-pairings of {} and [] if you even still do that
[00:03:32] <aeth> I don't think _ and - are the "same" but they might be. What about ` and \? again, idk
[00:04:01] <aeth> You'd still want to keep the restrictions of (1) no numeric start and (2) only alphanumeric, though
[00:04:06] <gilberth> Does this normalization normalize "H" and "Н" and "Η"?
[00:04:22] <aeth> the harder part is e.g. ss with ß
[00:04:31] <aeth> and how to deal with the four Latin i's
[00:04:45] <gilberth> What is the issue with ß?
[00:05:11] <aeth> you have the issue of Ii in English vs Iı and İi in Turkish (reasonable solution: they're all the same as far as nicks are concerned), where locale affects case
[00:05:20] <aeth> maybe normalization deals with that, maybe it's an additional restriction
[00:05:41] <aeth> as for ß and ss, that's an issue of case sensitivity depending on the language in a particularly nasty way (where the length changes!)
[00:05:47] <gilberth> What other languages have an sz-ligature like ß?
[00:05:49] <aeth> or, I guess it's ß and SS
[00:05:57] <aeth> I think ß might be lower case?
[00:06:00] <gilberth> Yes.
[00:06:12] <aeth> the ss is the ambiguity in the mapping
[00:06:19] <aeth> i.e. ss -> SS -> ß is possible
[00:06:48] <aeth> although you should in general err on the side of nick registrations covering broadly confusable names
[00:07:09] <gilberth> ß is lower case, a ligature of ſ (s) and z. You use SS in all uppercase, as there is no uppercase ligature for it.
[00:07:21] <aeth> I wouldn't even be opposed to aeth also claiming aeth_ and aeth__ and aeth___ etc. through to the nick length limit.
[00:07:34] <aeth> Since clients commonly append _s on disconnect/reconnect until they run out of space
[00:07:49] <aeth> (well, run out of space assuming the standard minimum even though most servers are longer)
[00:08:00] <gilberth> Yep, that is a convention, everyone assumes.
[00:08:29] <gilberth> What if a gilber1h would pop up?
[00:09:11] <sham1> There actually is an uppercase letter for eszett nowadays
[00:09:40] <gilberth> Yes, a silly invention. And it still is no letter, dammit. It's a ligature.
[00:09:48] <aeth> ẞß
[00:09:53] <aeth> at least in my compose key
[00:10:02] <gilberth> Nobody uses that.
[00:10:18] <aeth> including unicode's upcase/downcase stuff
[00:10:34] <sham1> It may be a ligature, but at least in the German orthography they regard it as a letter, so whatever
[00:10:50] <aeth> but at least you can say "ẞased" or whatever even though Germans won't get it
[00:11:08] <gilberth> Yes, with all the problems, like someone popping up and inventing an uppercase variant.
[00:12:10] <gilberth> BTW you also use "ss", when ß is not available.
[00:13:01] <gilberth> And in Swiss German there is no ß. Nasty "symbol".
[00:13:36] <sham1> I mean, æ is also a ligature yet that's also used as a letter in some languages like Danish and Norwegian (both Bokmål and Nynorsk for the linguistic pedantry)
[00:14:20] <sham1> As is å, incidentally, coming from two As being written on top of each other
[00:14:27] <Alfr> gilberth, on gilber1h: Require that any new nick has some minimum edit distance to all registered nicks ...
[00:14:46] <gilberth> Yes. And there indeed is Æ.
[00:15:16] <gilberth> Also here in Danish, when there is no "å" you use "aa".
[00:15:47] <gilberth> However upper case ß is a silly recent invention nobody uses.
[00:16:46] <gilberth> And it looks wrong. As there is uppercase "ſ" to begin with, it's "S".
[00:17:13] <gilberth> My Duden from the 50s still uses that other long s.
[00:17:31] <gilberth> Duden = standard German dictionary.
[00:19:51] *** Quits: Aurora_v_kosmose (~LispyLigh@user/lispylights) (Quit: brb)
[00:19:52] <gilberth> And there is no single word which begins with "ß".
[00:20:26] <sham1> Sure, it is a recent thing, an "orthographic neologism" so to say, but it's useful. After all, ß wouldn't just casemap into SS. It might also turn into SZ when there's a word already with an "ss" in place of ß. At least with ẞ, there's now an unambiguous upper- and lowercase mapping that doesn't require one to have access to a German dictionary just to know how to turn ß uppercase or how, if ever, to turn SS or SZ down to ß

[00:22:51] <sham1> Maßen is different from Massen, so that's where you would get SZ, at least with standard orthography
[00:23:09] <gilberth> Maße and Masse are two different words. Pronounced different and meaning completely different things.
[00:23:26] <gilberth> sham1: You were faster.
[00:23:53] <gilberth> sham1: Is that in the Duden? Would be news to me.
[00:24:23] <gilberth> I have never seen "SZ", never.

[00:27:54] <sham1> Well Wikipedia says that "Prior to this time, it was recommended to render <ß> as <SS> in allcaps except when there was ambiguity, in which case it should be rendered as <SZ>." But it's Wikipedia so hm
[00:28:20] <gilberth> aeth: May I spell you as æþ?
[00:28:41] <gilberth> shma1: Does it say, who does recommend that?
[00:29:42] <sham1> Nope. Even has a "citation needed" at the end, so I'm not actually sure how legit that is. Would have to go to some German sources to see if there has been any recommendation like that
[00:30:35] <gilberth> However, this all is not rational. We lost ſ and write it as s, so all would be easier when "sz" would be default writing for "ß", with latter being, what it was: A ligature, a type setter may use.
[00:31:17] <sham1> Languages seldom are. I wouldn't personally get worried until "fi" and "ffi" became their own letters
[00:33:25] <gilberth> Duden says, it always is "SS". <https://www.duden.de/sprachwissen/rechtschreibregeln/doppel-s-und-scharfes-s> unless you have the uppercase ß, in which case you may use that instead.
[00:33:26] -ixelp- Duden | s-Schreibung: s, ss und ß
[00:36:15] <aeth> gilberth: I mean, I think aeth ought to register æth as well, not really æþ though
[00:36:36] <gilberth> There used to be more ligatures, which you would observe. (1) In writing words like t h i s, you would write "d r u ck e n" not "d r u c k e n", and when you hyphenate "ck" it gets "k-k", still.
[00:37:13] <gilberth> aeth: A pity, it looks so cute.
[00:40:24] <aeth> unfortunately (sb-unicode:normalize-string "æth") => "æth" so maybe ligatures do present difficulty
[00:40:49] <gilberth> Speaking of ligatures, where is "th" ligature, which I almost use as I write "h" with a descender and thus could merge it with the horizontal bar of the "t".
[00:41:03] <sham1> Apparently German Wikipedia has a relevant thing which at least seems better cited. Can't really read the citations since my German is weak. But they seem to cite the Duden in the "Großes ß"-article where this is from
[00:41:13] <aeth> maybe there's some other process other than normalize
[00:41:15] <sham1> "Kurz vor der Rechtschreibreform von 1996 war die Schreibweise „SZ“ nur noch in Ausnahmefällen möglich, wenn eine Ersetzung durch „SS“ zu Verwechslungen führen würde. So wurde „Masse“ zu „MASSE“, aber „Maße“ zu „MASZE“."
[00:41:21] <gilberth> aeth: Yes, see all this discussion tonight. I say "ß" is a ligature, while everbody else calls it a letter.
[00:42:39] <White_Flame> MAßßE
[00:42:41] <sham1> aeth: NFKD might make "æth" into "aeth"
[00:42:43] <gilberth> sham1: Well, I looked it up in the online Duden, and "SZ" seems to be gone. And it says "möglich" not mandated.
[00:43:27] <gilberth> White_Flame: There is no double ß.
[00:43:36] <White_Flame> there is now!

[00:44:32] <gilberth> Might be valid in the US, we have the Duden. Although it at times also is silly.
[00:45:09] <sham1> Nevermind, "æ" doesn't turn into "ae" even with NFKD
[00:45:50] <gilberth> Guess, it doesn't do transliteration as otherwise å = aa
[00:46:06] <gilberth> And ä = ae, too :)

[14:12:49] <selwyn> what
[14:13:07] <shka> yes, for all of the features, the maximum length of the usb type c cable is 1 meter
[14:13:12] <shka> https://www.anixter.com/content/dam/Suppliers/Legrand/13354_Legrand_USB%203.1%20Type-C%20QA%20Cut%20Sheet.pdf
[14:15:32] <selwyn> they are used for headphones though
[14:15:41] <sham1> That's horrible. Especially if one wants a charging cable that is USB-C or would that be more for data transfer stuff
[14:16:01] <shka> you don't need 100gbps data transfer for headphones
[14:16:29] <SAL9000> 1m is certainly very limiting for desktop use cases
[14:16:38] <SAL9000> headphones can use usb 2.0 mode though (4m)
[14:16:46] <selwyn> i see

[14:17:57] <selwyn> yeah sure
[14:18:16] <shka> it is counter-strike related stuff
[14:18:40] <shka> so at work we divided all of the maps into discreet zones 
[14:19:08] <shka> and i had idea for representing the round play trough as a graph
[14:20:08] <selwyn> i see
[14:20:21] <shka> edges in this graph would indicate movement of the player from one zone to another, throwing flash/smoke, perhaps even spotting the enemy, and last but not least, frags
[14:21:21] <shka> idea is that, excluding spawning, everything can be anchored into one, or more vertices 
[14:22:08] <shka> for instance frag can be anchored into two prior locations for each for target and the attacker
[14:23:02] <shka> there is a little bit of data mining algorithms for graphs, so it would be useful representation for comparing rounds, looking for a similar round and stuff
[14:23:16] <shka> however, i had a though
[14:23:19] <shka> *thought
[14:24:30] <shka> can i somehow design algorithm that would find the most significant edge in the graph, defined as the edge that has the most impact on everything that happens after it
[14:24:56] <selwyn> i would not know
[14:25:01] <shka> lets say that i am only interested in the frags
[14:25:26] <shka> i could, in theory, slice round on each frag into the before and after parts
[14:25:42] <selwyn> yes
[14:26:25] <shka> now, if i only could find K most similar before parts, i would be able to compare the after parts to see how similar/different they are
[14:26:47] <shka> or even attempt at approximating the utility function of the frag
[14:26:58] <selwyn> but would that correspond to how impactful the event was
[14:27:40] <shka> well, technically impact should be calculated by the utility of winning the match 
[14:27:53] <SAL9000> you could try to simulate "what if that frag was not thrown" but while it's easy to exclude a player's actions (i.e. X was killed early, cancel all of X's future actions) you can't predict the actions that X's victims would have taken if X had not killed them
[14:28:28] <shka> SAL9000: i actually suspect that I can
[14:28:29] <selwyn> i agree with sal in that it seems very difficult to answer this question without assuming things about ´what would have happened´
[14:28:43] <SAL9000> may be interesting to try making a chess-style position utility function?
[14:28:52] <SAL9000> then you can derive action utility from that
[14:28:59] <selwyn> is that related to min max?
[14:29:08] <SAL9000> not necessarily
[14:29:54] <SAL9000> could be as simple as "team X's position utility is (based on) how many matches they won after a position within X similiarity-index of this one"
[14:30:04] <SAL9000> big data/ML style design
[14:30:13] * selwyn imagines ibm deep blue beating s1mple at the world championships
[14:30:21] <selwyn> sal: i see
[14:30:28] <shka> yes, that's the one thing that seems to be possible
[14:30:38] <SAL9000> maybe combine it with some analytical stuff depending on the game-mode
[14:30:54] <SAL9000> # of players alive, amount of $ in player's hands, capture points taken/not taken, etc.
[14:30:54] <shka> in fact i made classifier that would attempt to predict if the CT is winning
[14:31:21] <SAL9000> given a classifier that predicts CT's chance at winning, invert it to get T's chance at winning, and there's your position utility
[14:31:50] <shka> it had pretty good F1 score, but it was not exactly correctly trained so dose not mean a thing
[14:32:17] <SAL9000> alternatively I guess you could make some attempts at battle simulation?
[14:32:34] <shka> i was thinking about that, but this is complex 
[14:32:34] <SAL9000> assign each player an accuracy score, take FoV cone + LoS into account, etc.
[14:32:57] <shka> right now i just want to find the pivotal action
[14:32:59] <SAL9000> the further you are into the round the more data you have about the players and thus able to simulate (somewhat) more accurately
[14:33:20] <SAL9000> yes -- to discover the pivotal action you need to simulate in some way what would have happened if the action was not taken
[14:33:21] <shka> as defined: action that alters the further gameplay the most
[14:33:34] <SAL9000> position utility is the more abstract approach
[14:33:46] <SAL9000> simulating the rest of the round would be a more detailed approach
[14:34:22] <SAL9000> hmm... maybe you could pull in existing work on CS bots?
[14:34:45] <shka> i think that gathering rounds where the frag did not happen and checking if the group average distance to the rounds when the frag happens is a pretty promising approach
[14:34:50] <selwyn> what would the meaning of vertices in the graph be? if you have a throwing flash edge for example
[14:35:07] <SAL9000> a vertex would be two positions (CT and T)
[14:35:21] <SAL9000> (or one, depending on definition)
[14:35:41] <shka> selwyn: CT player at zone -> flash at zone -> Terrorist at zone fully blinded
[14:36:15] <SAL9000> so vertices are individual player states, not entire team/match states?
[14:36:21] <shka> SAL9000: yeah
[14:36:25] <selwyn> hm
[14:36:32] <SAL9000> that seems prone to oversimplification
[14:36:36] <selwyn> it seems there can be subleties
[14:37:02] <SAL9000> consider defining a match-state similiarity function
[14:37:06] <selwyn> what happens if you throw a flash into an empty area, which iiuc happens quite a lot
[14:37:14] <shka> SAL9000: i already have that
[14:37:25] <SAL9000> so then you can afford to have vertices containing match-states
[14:37:32] <shka> but i want to consider the sequence of states
[14:37:38] <shka> that's why graphs
[14:37:42] <selwyn> yes
[14:37:49] <SAL9000> yes... but you can't reduce players to independent actors
[14:37:51] <shka> selwyn: then no second arrow
[14:38:01] <selwyn> oh, i see
[14:38:25] <SAL9000> throwing a flash into an empty area still has an effect, though
[14:38:38] <SAL9000> your team hears your callout, enemy team hears the explosion
[14:38:47] <shka> SAL9000: 9000: true, but here is the thing, graph interconnects players into a network
[14:38:48] <SAL9000> (and the opportunity cost)
[14:39:03] <SAL9000> so there's "affected by" edges, not just "direct impact"?
[14:39:45] <selwyn> i suppose you can infer ´affected by´ from the zone the event took place in
[14:39:54] <selwyn> and the zones of the other players at the time
[14:40:20] <SAL9000> + the distance that a given effect is rendered in
[14:40:24] <SAL9000> "can this player hear that frag?"
[14:40:33] <shka> yes, so that blinded terrorist would be terrorist at zone full blinded as a successor of both flash at zone and the prior terrorist at zone
[14:40:59] <SAL9000> ahh
[14:41:22] <shka> sort of difficult to explain without the visual aid
[14:42:13] <selwyn> it seems awkward to have vertices as being a kind of ´union type´ of grenades and players at zones
[14:43:12] <shka> perhaps, but at the same time this allows me to encode stuff like frag as a direct consequence of the flash
[14:43:16] <selwyn> yes
[14:43:25] <shka> and this could be visualized
[14:43:34] <SAL9000> wait a frag as the consequence of the flash?
[14:43:38] <SAL9000> isn't that backwards?
[14:43:54] <shka> no, it makes sense 
[14:44:03] <SAL9000> or you mean a normal grenade being thrown into the flash zone
[14:44:33] <selwyn> do you mean a frag thrown shortly after a flash, and you can see this quite straightforwardly on the graph
[14:44:33] <shka> i mean the flashbang that blinded enemy player who was subsequently killed with a rifle
[14:44:34] <SAL9000> clearly I'm not awake enough yet :-)
[14:44:55] <SAL9000> ah, "frag" as in "kill" not as in "fragmentation grenade"
[14:45:00] * selwyn deploys a flashbang in sal9000´s direction
[14:45:04] <selwyn> that will wake you up :)
[14:45:08] <shka> yeah, i don't like using the word "kill"

[16:19:52] <hayley> I am yet to check. But I think btw the "emit all assignments that are present in r but not r \delta_c" rule is broken for e.g. (ab)* as the assignments are always there in the leftover (ab)* after taking the derivative of the Kleene star.

[16:37:09] <gilberth> This one is easy and you might prune that with a rule for (+), won't work in general, if sth follows.
[16:39:35] <gilberth> An earlier draft was explicit here and specified an disambiguation map, where one could be for POSIX and one for Perl.
[16:42:52] <selwyn> shka: i had the thought of doing football analytics
[16:43:11] <selwyn> obviously it is a more advanced field than counterstrike analytics, but i wonder how much overlap there is with your approach
[16:43:23] <hayley> gilberth: Can you integrate REs? Will that remove my headache?

[16:59:52] <hayley> An alternation to the rule: once we are clear of T ← P (i.e. we end up doing one gensym i.e. T_k ← T) we keep generating T_k ← T_k

[18:13:16] <gilberth> hayley: I believe a* [t] (a + aaa) b is a good example.
[18:14:25] <gilberth> Both t's slide into the alternative.
[18:14:39] <hayley> Well, I guess I'll have to test it then.
[18:15:32] <gilberth> After all a*[t](a + aaa) = a*[t]a + a*[t]aaa

[18:24:12] <hayley> Still, a* gobbles the most by POSIX and so there isn't ambiguity for us. What about a*[t](ab|aac)? There is only one solution but we don't know it.
[18:24:25] * hayley got bitten by Markdown syntax.
[18:24:50] <selwyn> use markless
[18:24:56] <hayley> `a*[t](ab|aac)` would be interesting.

[18:39:22] <hayley> Well, yes.
[18:43:05] <gilberth> hayley: Exactly, you don't know yet. That is what all this algorithm is about after all. Otherwise I would need to rename assigned tags.
[18:45:15] <gilberth> BTW, this where Laurikari failed, despite a paper and a master theses. He wanted to tell early and always hand waved, as there must be a priority function, which cannot exist as I showed.
[18:48:11] <gilberth> He does the classical NFA->DFA conversion with asignments on transitions and wanted to kill one, in case two conflicting would merge and had the idea that transitions would have a priority. Can't work. I was "betrayed" by that because I believed him all too long. And he never said how to get at those priorities, until I found examples, where no priority what so ever would work. Lost much time with this.
[18:49:06] <gilberth> hayley: What you dream of is the same, milady. There is no short cut, sorry.
