[00:21:51] <rotateq> lel I've gone through randomly some repos of shinmera and one of the oldest is "eiffel-faff" und in the README: "This is garbage because this language is garbage." :D
[00:22:13] <rotateq> hm maybe pop it from my potential list of new things to learn

[00:23:25] <rotateq> I thought Bertrand Meyer has some good points in building big systems and such.
[00:30:00] <hayley> Woohoo, the university library didn't lose their copy of Compiling with Continuations.

[02:20:16] <shka> adacore?
[02:20:31] <sm2n> Hm? I don't see such a post... Is the irc-matrix bridge dropping posts again?
[02:20:31] <shka> honestly, why people won't use Ada instead of Rust?

[03:04:39] <sm2n> For a moment I thought the author of CEPL did remixes on the side
[03:08:13] <rotateq> haha yes baggers :)
[03:12:02] * gilberth 's event loop is bust and he should consider switching careers.
[03:12:33] <hayley> gilberth: I'll trade with you: I'll do the event loop, and you do parallel GC.
[03:13:21] <gilberth> hayley: Terrific!
[03:13:53] <gilberth> Programming is hard, let's go shopping.
[03:14:12] * hayley still tries to figure out how the copying loop in gencgc works.
[03:14:16] <hayley> I already made two shopping lists though.
[03:15:03] <gilberth> Yeah, but none for a machine for me. And no 5120x2880 pixels display either.
[03:15:46] <hayley> I said it once, I'll say it again: good luck running anything sufficiently parallel, when you have a single-threaded GC.
[03:16:42] <gilberth> I am fine with the GC, I have. I believe.
[03:17:23] <gilberth> Can it be that pause times with SBCL are higher than with CCL?
[03:18:01] <hayley> It's hard to compare, if SBCL and CCL generate code of different performance.
[03:18:11] <hayley> Faster code generated -> more consing -> more pauses.
[03:18:37] <gilberth> Not when the work per second is the same.
[03:19:24] <hayley> Right, but I would need to slow something down to get the same work per second.
[03:20:01] <hayley> (IIRC when I tested GCs on web servers, I tested with 75% the maximum load that each implementation could handle.)
[03:20:35] <gilberth> Well, there are only 60 frames per second that are actually send to the display. Somehow CCL never misses the 16ms dead line, while with SBCL at times I visually notice some pauses once in a while.
[03:20:58] <hayley> Also, different heap sizes? idk how the heap sizes in CCL work.
[03:21:27] <gilberth> I don't know either. Do I look like a GC expert?
[03:22:24] <hayley> I know --dynamic-space-size in SBCL.
[03:23:14] <gilberth> My SBCL has no options according to sbcl --help

[03:33:18] <hayley> Surprising.
[03:36:23] <gilberth> And why is there a --dynamic-space-size option to begin with?
[03:38:13] <hayley> So that I may run SBCL with --dynamic-space-size 10000 to bootstrap SICL.
[03:38:35] <hayley> (You did have to do that once, and it's been in my .emacs ever since.)
[03:38:54] <gilberth> Exactly. Why is that option needed?
[03:39:32] <hayley> SBCL maintains a "page table" of fixed size.
[03:39:51] <gilberth> Ah.
[03:39:59] <hayley> It probably wouldn't hurt to allow resizing, but that's how gencgc works at the moment.
[03:41:00] <hayley> A worse offender is the JVM with the G1 collector, because it needs remembered sets for pointers coming into every region. Thus you have O(n^2) size for n regions, so the region size varies w.r.t heap size, and the number of regions remains relatively constant.
[03:41:51] <hayley> And if you want to resize regions to resize the heap...you have to trash all your remembered sets and recompute them from scratch, which is very bad.
[03:42:22] <gilberth> Yeah, have you less depressing news for me?
[03:43:05] <selwyn> https://tech.nextroll.com/blog/dev/2022/02/02/rustenstein.html
[03:43:35] <hayley> gilberth said "less", not "more".

[03:46:35] <hayley> "I don't know how it works, but I've surely been exposed and I'm not dead." Great standards.
[03:46:45] * moon-child just got his third vaxx dose
[03:46:51] <hayley> "They put the spike proteins, the most dangeous part, into your body" eh?
[03:47:18] <gilberth> Oh yeah, I should be dead by now. Thrice.
[03:47:29] <hayley> "The survival rate is way up there, 99.9" Only _three_ nines? Joe Armstrong did nine.
[03:48:01] <hayley> Wikipedia: "During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaccination misinformation about COVID-19 circulated on social media platforms related to the spike protein's role in COVID-19 vaccines. Spike proteins were said to be dangerously "cytotoxic" and mRNA vaccines containing them therefore in themselves dangerous. Spike proteins are not cytotoxic or dangerous"
[03:48:02] <hayley> lol
[03:48:18] <gilberth> A bit spike RNA is sure way more dangerous than a virus. Makes sense.
[03:48:30] * hayley bored now.
[03:48:48] <waleee> ... lol they must be terrified of the actual protein vaccines then
[03:49:16] <gilberth> Join my club. I lost my motivation for tonight after my event loop turned out fubar.
[03:50:10] <gilberth> waleee: Those are olde and well known and tested.
[03:51:16] <waleee> gilberth: I know. But apparently not the anti-vaxx crowd apparently
[03:51:32] <waleee> ehm s/apparently//2
[03:53:00] <gilberth> But it's like the local Green party saying that Russian natural gas is better for the climate then nuclear power. Nah, they don't say that, but they act like that. The local Green party brags about the climate, but actually are responsible for us having more CO_2 emissions than needed. /me shrugs.
[03:53:29] * hayley continues scanning around, and finds a talk show talking about "protestors throwing bricks through Starbucks windows, while the police don't do anything".
[03:53:58] <gilberth> waleee: I was addressing the anti-vaxx faction. They are stupid and cause death.
[03:54:07] <waleee> gilberth: honestly it was hilarious to read that Gazprom owns the storage for gas in Germany
[03:54:10] <hayley> I was hoping I'd find something interesting from radio stations no one marked out. Not talking about the poor little Starbucks windows.
[03:54:36] <gilberth> You don't pity Starbucks?
[03:55:18] <hayley> "I don't care about the poor little Starbucks windows that got smashed at protests" - Murray Bookchin to Michael Parenti, 1971
[03:55:40] <waleee> is there any Starbucks in Germany? The Swedish franchise decided to close shop
[03:55:43] <rotateq> It's such a dilemma, we have this natural fusion reactor in front of the house but aren't yet able to get as much as we need. (not just the infinitesimal amount getting to earth directly)
[03:55:50] <rotateq> waleee: yes
[03:56:09] <rotateq> I have never been to one.
[03:56:19] <gilberth> waleee: Yes, and the plan is to substitute both nuclear and coal power by Gazprom natural gas. But that is good for peace. I believe in peace though trade. Fun part: The Green party here protests against the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline for natural gas from Russia and is very pro-US.
[03:56:47] * hayley continues tuning and there is some pretty intense violin playing.
[03:57:55] <waleee> gilberth: well, it gives a kind of leverage on Russia I guess, but only if there's the possiblity for other sources for gas 
[03:58:10] <rotateq> gilberth: If I'm allowed to ask, for what is this event loop you talked about? Or in your FreeCLIM?
[03:58:45] <waleee> gilberth: and that would require a LNG-terminal somewhere
[03:58:49] <gilberth> waleee: Rusians always was a reliable trading partner even during cold-war.
[03:59:13] <gilberth> waleee: Germany has no LNG terminal I read.
[03:59:26] <gilberth> * Russia
[03:59:48] <waleee> yes, and as such you don't really have any large scale options for gas besides the pipelines from Russia
[04:00:18] <waleee> which is a shit situation regardless of the current security situation
[04:01:03] <gilberth> rotateq: Yes, for my Free-CLIM. It's a bit complicated as I need an aux thread to read from the X server, do event compression and batching of changes the application makes to the sheet hierarchy and output history. I need to rewrite that part. Tomorrow.
[04:01:36] * hayley decides to use another SDR.
[04:01:51] <rotateq> oki as you are able to :)
[04:02:18] <rotateq> Anyways I really hope you're still alright as far as possible.
[04:02:29] <gilberth> waleee: You see the ironic part of that? The Green party is anti-Russia and pro-US, but advocates to shutdown nuclear and coal and make electricity from natural gas.
[04:03:36] <gilberth> They are children, they want their cake and eat it too.
[04:03:45] * hayley continues tuning around and hears some weird noises.
[04:03:54] <waleee> yeah, I know the iconic Green party (of many countries) lack of environmental strategic thinking
[04:04:07] <waleee> *know of
[04:04:31] <gilberth> Germany is special because of its irrational fear of nuclear power.
[04:04:58] <gilberth> And the local Green party has its roots in the 80s anti-nuclear protest.
[04:05:23] <rotateq> maybe they also think a fair (mathematical) partitioning of that cake would be just cutting it in n pieces
[04:05:25] <hayley> "CHN CNR1 Jammer/Firedrake TWN Sound of Hope" Makes sense, I guess.
[04:05:25] <gilberth> It's political incorrect here to be pro-nuclear.
[04:05:41] <waleee> something the russians had their paws in (in the 70/80ies)
[04:05:52] <waleee> well, soviets
[04:05:54] <gilberth> They did?
[04:06:09] <waleee> they sponsored the anti-nuclear peace movements
[04:06:14] <rotateq> and shutting it down before enough serious alternatives are made
[04:06:25] <gilberth> To sell natural gas? Nah, that would have been too strategic.
[04:06:56] <waleee> gilberth: ... since it would mean that the West would have political problems with their nukes
[04:07:09] <gilberth> This is funny. How come then that the Green party is pro-US? That doesn't fit.
[04:07:19] <waleee> * internal political problems
[04:08:06] <gilberth> waleee: Well, that is the first mistake the anti-nuclear protestants made: nuclear weapons /= nuclear power.
[04:08:42] <gilberth> I never was fond of the US having nuclear warheads in Germany. But I always was pro-nuclear and anti-coal.
[04:09:03] * hayley listens to the Russian navy, apparently.
[04:09:05] <rotateq> and I don't want to know what just a small solar system for on top of the house still costs for private people
[04:09:26] <gilberth> Conspiracy theory: The Russians causes Chernobyl to fuel the anti nuclear protests. scnr

[10:10:24] <hayley> (Or rather I want to make sure only one thread works on a page at a time, and all pages get worked on.)

[10:27:20] <kakuhen> always lern lisp
[10:27:43] <ln43> yes but just to compare with something else
[10:27:45] <kakuhen> but be careful of it poisoning you... i used to love objective-c dearly, but now i dont enjoy it as much, and every time i am outside of common lisp, i wish i weren't...
[10:27:54] <kakuhen> with that said, I am somewhat enjoying clojure -- it's just a lot to ingest since it's quite different
[10:29:17] <ln43> ok.. to be honest i think that is required a lot of time to be properly trained with the use of Lisp languages
[10:29:44] <ln43> but maybe the same is valid for every other language
[10:31:13] <ln43> clojure is not well seen by a Lisp user, because they use the term functional improperly

[11:40:52] <White_Flame> I do think there's space in the non-imperative/OO/functional fields to explore better declarative concepts, as those sorts of langs tend to only solve some subproblems and often aren't reasonably complete application platforms
[11:40:54] <GreaseMonkey> funny that there was a mention of ocaml earlier, i'm currently learning it
[11:40:57] <epony> most serious problem is failure to export the languages from corporate premises out to the world, nobody takes up commercial lock-in
[11:41:36] <epony> and only commerce hires people to work in lock-in variants
[11:42:41] <epony> the academic has been sucked from Universities to the big businesses.. and they don't get the same level of "academic" peering inside, so produce mostly derivatives
[11:42:47] <moon-child> White_Flame: people were doing gui in prolog... and there is a common lisp implementation... I think _they're_ satisfied at least with what they've got
[11:43:10] <White_Flame> prolog is still IMO a 100% imperatively directed language
[11:43:47] <White_Flame> there's no wiggle room for the runtime/compiler to reorder & index things intelligently; it's all strictly under explicit user control
[11:44:11] <moon-child> I see
[11:44:28] <White_Flame> it's a pretty good query language, but as a programming language it's fully imperative
[11:45:28] <moon-child> what do you think is declarative?  XML?
[11:45:41] <phoe> xml isn't a programming language
[11:46:02] <moon-child> I didn't say it was a programming language, I said it was declarative
[11:46:17] <phoe> hm
[11:46:31] <phoe> weird to apply "declarative" to it then
[11:46:40] <phoe> any data structure is "declarative" if you look at it this way
[11:46:53] <phoe> no matter if it's XML, JSON, TOML, or a text file
[11:47:06] <White_Flame> moon-child: theorem provers are generally declarative, but they're not really programming platforms
[11:47:14] <moon-child> phoe: well, yeah, that's part of my question to White_Flame :P
[11:47:27] <White_Flame> our internal prolog derivative removed a ton of imperativeness, but there's still more to go
[11:47:42] <moon-child> White_Flame: can't you compile coq to haskell and c?
[11:47:49] <White_Flame> one of my own personal definitions of imperative is full user control of the program counter
[11:48:21] <moon-child> so a lazy language is non-imperative?
[11:48:27] <White_Flame> I guess haskell with its laziness fits that definiton, though
[11:49:04] <White_Flame> erm, is _not_ imperative to that particular defintional statement
[11:49:10] <moon-child> yeah
[11:49:54] * moon-child has a milder definition: a language is imperative if it distinguishes = from ==
[11:49:56] <White_Flame> but the thing is, anytime I get deeper into programming langauge abstraction & communicatnig user intent, I get back into AI instead ;)
[11:50:17] <moon-child> (ok, it works better in c.  'distinguishes eql from setq' is not as punchy :P)
[11:50:55] <White_Flame> I'm just sick of all the grindwork involved in piecing together software for computers to run
[11:51:27] <moon-child> I'm sick of all the grindwork involved in living life.  Can't seem to get away from it, though
[11:51:40] <moon-child> (not to be defeatist, but)
[11:51:44] <White_Flame> yeah, but IRL is not a virtual, fully contructed and mutable space ;)
[11:52:09] <White_Flame> and with that control of the virtual space, certainly we can do better instead of ossifying on legacy
[11:52:30] <moon-child> you can't get away from effort, nor--I would argue--should you want to

[11:52:59] <White_Flame> effort doesn't have to be repetition

[11:54:16] <White_Flame> we don't write machine code anymore
[11:54:18] <White_Flame> (generally speaking)
[11:54:31] <White_Flame> we don't worry about statically allocating a memory map to our programs anymore
[11:55:06] <moon-child> indeed!  But we still have repetition; it just happens on a higher level now
[11:55:10] <White_Flame> but at some point the abstraction of function frames and imperative processing is still where everything settles, without too many additional "don't have to worry about anymore, the computer does it for us" points
[11:55:13] <moon-child> it's not like we'll eventually deduplicate everything

[11:55:23] <moon-child> rather, we'll get to a point where the things we duplicate become increasingly more interesting
[11:55:50] <White_Flame> I'm not talking about duplication of artifacts, but the repeition of the type of work we do at the same abstraction level project after project
[11:56:41] <White_Flame> I don't have any reason to believe that we're at a legimate maximum of abstraction
[11:56:41] <moon-child> Every time I write an essay, I write an abstract, introduction, and conclusion.  Isn't that repetitive?
[11:57:08] <White_Flame> human communication hasn't really changed level of abstraction
[11:57:12] <moon-child> 'I don't have any reason to believe that we're at a legimate maximum of abstraction'  I definitely don't think we have any reason to think that either

[12:12:50] <White_Flame> in other words, x=0/0 does not assign any value to x
[12:13:05] <White_Flame> it's simply tautological, as any number equals 0/0
[12:13:56] <White_Flame> (or doesn't equal, as x is generally going to be an individual number, while 0/0 is all numbers)

[12:14:51] <White_Flame> default math behavior in our prolog derivate is that division by zero simply doesn't bind ;)

[13:25:36] <White_Flame> yeah, inline computation cost != parallel computation cost
[13:26:14] <hayley> Though I suspect Appel is implying that the GC processor runs concurrently, and this usually induces more overhead on mutators.

[14:24:42] <selwyn> weird thing about qc is that there are no programs as such, only algorithms (and a very small number of them at that)
[14:25:41] <selwyn> and targeting the 'native gate set' of the qc is particularly important (instead of some intermediate representation)
[14:25:57] <selwyn> and these native gate sets are not really fixed yet
[14:27:25] <selwyn> so you essentially always know what you will be compiling, but have to be able to target a huge array of potential targets
[14:27:33] <selwyn> which seems very inverted from classical computing
[14:27:53] <hayley> .oO(Instruction selection! Instruction selection!)
[14:28:07] <selwyn> hayley: i don't know how appealing this would be for you?
[14:32:43] <selwyn> we are still in the era when order of magnitude savings in computational time can be delivered
[14:33:27] <hayley> idk, I've still not read the quantum computing book.
[14:33:45] <hayley> And that is gross negligence on my behalf, at this point.
[14:34:46] <moon-child> youtu.be/F_Riqjdh2oM  I liked this video
[14:35:14] <selwyn> it's plausible that i could end up on a quantum compiling team soon
[14:38:07] <selwyn> but my suspicion is that, as physics nerds don't take computer science nerds seriously
[14:38:25] <selwyn> a lot of useful compiler theory concepts won't get used
[14:39:32] * hayley global value numbers selwyn
[14:43:58] <selwyn> there are also tough and interesting challenges that go into the design of the control electronics of a quantum computer
[14:46:50] <selwyn> we have to decode measurement outcomes (which are just bit strings) on dedicated asics, close to real-time (measurements occur at around a ghz rate)
[14:48:00] <selwyn> the algorithms we have are of polynomial complexity, but we need better ones otherwise it won't be practical to implement them
[14:49:53] <selwyn> we are at basically linear time, but it would be great (and afaict not unreasonable) to have average case constant time, if you have a number of asics working in parallel that scales reasonably with the problem size
[14:51:13] <selwyn> how would i go about 'learning to compiler'? are the classic books still the way to go
[14:52:24] * moon-child absorbed everything he knows from the ether, can not say
[14:52:32] <hayley> CwC is the first compiler book I've properly read. The rest was just googling for papers.

[16:59:22] <gilberth> lol. No wonder my event loop appears bust, when I process events in reverse order. And it always surprises me what a little sleep could do.
[17:14:29] <Alfr> gilberth, that one's nasty, had a similar case where it took me days to figure out some erratic behavior.
[17:19:28] <gilberth> Yes, and as I read events in a bundle, it depended on timing, too. When I am fast and few events come in, I read an event at a time, no problem here. When I am slow or events come in at a fast pace, I read a bunch of events at once, inadvertently reverse them and appear fubar.
[17:20:51] <gilberth> But now it works like a charm and I could call it a day. :-)

[21:13:39] <shka> interesting, summarize please 
[21:13:40] <drakonis> the instant he stopped being involved with openmw, suddenly things started moving forward
[21:13:57] <drakonis> openmw finally has lua support because zini isnt blocking that anymore
[21:14:10] <shka> i know that zini was skeptical toward lua
[21:14:19] <drakonis> he wanted python iirc?
[21:14:19] <shka> but otherwise i don't know what was the problem
[21:14:34] <shka> no, he wanted to fix the original scripting language

[21:17:49] <drakonis> its almost universally better than vanilla morrowind plus mcp
[21:18:11] <drakonis> minus the lack of support for mwse-lua mods, but that won't take much longer
[21:19:24] <drakonis> anyways, back to zini, his presence pushed people away from contributing to openmw and led to a lot of major mod authors considering rolling their own morrowind reimplementation just to avoid dealing with zini
[21:20:21] <drakonis> one dumb zini thing was not improving openmw's construction set's UI
[21:22:59] <drakonis> he'd always shoot down attempts to improve it, which pissed people off a lot

[22:00:01] <shka> drakonis: i mean, original morrowind engine is not only dated, but also, frankly, shit
[22:00:11] <drakonis> indeed it is.
[22:00:23] <drakonis> but openmw's first release is dated to 2008
[22:00:29] <drakonis> a cool 6 years after morrowind
[22:00:30] <shka> i KNOW :D
[22:00:33] <drakonis> its amazing isnt it
[22:00:45] <shka> that's when i started learning programing actually
[22:00:54] <drakonis> that happened to be a couple years after oblivion
[22:00:55] <shka> and that's why i started with C++
[22:01:01] <drakonis> and fallout 3 would soon release
[22:01:21] <shka> actually, openmw is even slightly older then that
[22:01:37] <shka> it eventually was written in the D lang
[22:01:50] <shka> *actually 
[22:01:51] <drakonis> huh, i see.
[22:01:56] <drakonis> D lang huh?
[22:01:59] <shka> yeah
[22:02:23] <shka> and it was rewritten in C++ by a lot of efforts from  zini
[22:02:45] <shka> i think that there is nothing or my old code in openmw
[22:03:02] <shka> BUT
[22:03:26] <shka> when you launch openmw-cs, those icons were made by me :D
[22:04:08] <drakonis> ha, nice.
[22:05:33] <shka> "modified" icons were replaced tough 
[22:05:49] <shka> but they follow the my original design 
[22:07:32] <shka> also, rendering engine was replaced
[22:07:37] <drakonis> a part of history, aye?
[22:07:38] <drakonis> yeah it has
[22:07:40] <shka> but that's a common knowledge 
[22:07:45] <drakonis> took them a good while
[22:08:13] <drakonis> but now that it is done, they've finally did it, they have the best experience
[22:09:09] <shka> yeah, also, it is funny to compare loading times of the vanilla morrowind and openmw
[22:11:07] <drakonis> ha, yes.
[22:11:11] <drakonis> and performance too.
[22:11:57] <drakonis> its really nice to have visual bells and whistles without heavy performance hits on newer computers

[23:36:09] *** Joins: jeosol (~jeosol@user/jeosol)
[23:36:20] <shka> selwyn: well, it is actually kinda horrible as a game, but has a very unique look, themes, and overall feel to it
[23:36:56] <shka> let's say that it is game in the overall category of jank, cult RPG
[23:37:01] <selwyn> i see
[23:37:06] <selwyn> not really my thing i guess
[23:37:36] <drakonis> there are mods to fix that
[23:37:41] <drakonis> which is something.
[23:38:00] <shka> oh, yeah
[23:38:01] <shka> mods
[23:38:27] <shka> anyway, i enjoy morrowind more then other TES games because it is WEIRD
[23:38:51] <shka> really ambitious world building
[23:39:03] <shka> not always successful 
[23:39:12] <shka> but ambitious 
[23:39:29] <shka> btw, have you played DUSK?
[23:40:31] <drakonis> hell yeah i have.
[23:41:04] <gilberth> Is that me, or does XQuartz forget to send a LeaveNotify event at times?
[23:41:26] *** Joins: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[23:41:39] <shka> so well, DUSK is kind of game that you need 4 minutes to see how awesome it is
[23:41:43] <shka> morrowind is not that
[23:41:43] <drakonis> indeed.
[23:41:45] <shka> :P
[23:41:54] <shka> it is not obviously good
[23:42:20] <drakonis> it does things quite differently from other games
[23:42:37] <shka> anyway
[23:42:54] <shka> selwyn: dusk is good, take a look at this gameplay https://antiochia.duckdns.org/index.php/s/Rnp8FirP2TzeLgx
[23:43:07] <gilberth> Yep, xev says so too. Terrific, another bug!
[23:44:51] <shka> i love how music synces with gameplay in this level
[23:49:05] <drakonis> have you played ultrakill?
[23:49:32] <drakonis> are you sure you're not confusing the sound effects with the music :V?
[23:49:48] <shka> drakonis: nah, i mean music
[23:49:55] <drakonis> actually, i think that's a different track that starts playing
[23:49:59] <shka> yes
[23:50:05] <drakonis> the music rules though
[23:50:27] <shka> i think that i will go with the nightmare reaper next
[23:50:34] <shka> if it will leav early access soon
[23:50:58] <drakonis> ultrakill is the game doom eternal wishes it could be
[23:52:09] <shka> yeah, i seen it 
[23:56:16] <drakonis> plenty of excellent stuff
[23:56:48] <shka> which is nice, there has been some real revival of this kind of games 
[23:57:39] <selwyn> ive started playing black mesa
[23:57:44] <selwyn> made with a lot of love
[23:58:06] <selwyn> generally, i don't like remakes of anything, but this is really nice
