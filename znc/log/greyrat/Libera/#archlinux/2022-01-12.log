I tried removing most of the crap that I can think of from kde. Big package and I regretted it right after my CPU was dying. I'll post what I have installed on that system and as well as running that command. It probably seems easier than grepping my journal via journalctl -b | grep "Jan 04" something like that.
[00:40:37] <Soulmadness12> grepped and hunted down as much packages I can think. Idk if some are lingering? I have to double check. But thanks, I was literally thinking about debugging my kernel and crap like that

[00:45:39] <dmc> it is not
[00:45:46] <Warepire> It's a terrible idea to install just one package from staging. It's a partial update. Either wait, or enable staging fully and accept anything that may happen if you do. Don't do it on machines that are important to you that they always work.

[07:13:32] <[dlp]> randomxusr: Are you truly referring to USB-PD (which is used between devices to negotiate power delivery) or the feature on some computer systems enabling devices to be powered from the computer whilst the computer itself is powered down?
[07:13:38] <randomxusr> Was looking to attempt with my laptop
[07:15:33] <randomxusr> [dlp], I'm referring to USB-PD. I'm concerned that the device may need to be built with that in mind. I guess most Mfrs keep it active and may cost extra to provide user control with addl circuitry

[12:12:16] <grawity> yeah, so, as in your own dns resolver, or as in authoritative server?

[12:14:05] <enoq> ^ this basically
[12:14:31] <enoq> but dunno, for anything bigger you probably go k8s which comes with custom dns
[12:14:39] <grawity> you'd run a resolver for the LAN to get better caching, better standards support (like EDNS) – many home routers have completely awful DNS caches; possibly as a bridge to another resolver via DoT (that way your LAN hosts don't need to care about DoT); and of course custom routing (e.g. domain 1 is resolved via VPN, domain 2 resolved via server X, etc)
[12:15:00] *** Joins: teraflops (~teraflops@62.117.173.125.dyn.user.ono.com)
[12:15:28] <enoq> right had issues with that in the past but newer router resolved that
[12:16:42] <grawity> you'd run an authoritative server for your domain to make management easier (e.g. instead of poking at a web-based provider's management panel, you just get regular file that you can edit with `vim`, or a SQL database), to be able to create fancier record types (that most providers don't support) like SSHFP or X25 or whatever you feel like, to create nonstandard subdomains, or because you like
[12:16:43] <grawity> running your own stuff
[12:17:59] <enoq> ok, so then I guess I'm probably not in that target group
[12:18:00] <grawity> sometimes home routers just run dnsmasq for DNS caching, but some run custom garbage that was written over a weekend and crashes whenever it sees an EDNS0 request, and some even go as far as make up nonexistent data
[12:18:52] <grawity> getting a better router (or not using its DNS cache at all) is one way to solve that, but I mean, if someone's already into networking anyway, they might prefer to separate those two tasks

[13:48:09] <intjtlgl[m]> https://pastebin.com/AHSSnJvf didn't want to flood chat with two pastebins if somebody wanted to take a look at this. I have been using arch for a little while but I am trying to harden the system too. I am not sure if there was a breach or not but I am looking to learn and find ways to prevent my system from experiencing random what apears to be software issues if it was only one at a time. However these things happen all the time.
[13:48:09] <intjtlgl[m]> Could be a brand new install or just a week or running for 6 months. The issues are always the same three or four things that happen so it appears that somebody is either getting in locally or on the intenret and running the same script as if I change things then it seems that the script they are trying to run no longer works and that one doesn't appear for a while lol

[13:55:11] <jelle> it seems to me that tracker3 just breaks? I really can't make sense of your "issue"
[13:55:21] <jelle> there is too much text
[13:56:36] <intjtlgl[m]> alright so when i was trying to open easy effects at first it said it could not find the mount when trying to start gvfs-daemon.service. I reinstalled gvfs as that was what i was trying to find out what it required to get the mount woirking but I am able to get it open now but it doesn't fully work as it doesn't seem to run the outputs going through it
[13:56:46] <intjtlgl[m]> I have a bunch of issues rolled into one.
[13:59:46] <intjtlgl[m]> what i would like to do if possible some how is try to wipe out the os and reinstall yet I am worried that I might get the issue I have trying to get my laptop up and running. That is when I run everything in pacstrap and go to do arch-chroot after it says cannot access /bin/bash i have both packages installed. The issue is that /usr/bin is there but /bin is not symlinked to /usr/bin. So I am going to try to download the newest iso as
[13:59:46] <intjtlgl[m]> that was decembers iso that I seemed to have a problem with.

[17:43:58] <th0rne> Hey, so I have a huge vimrc, mostly untouched for years, and there's some setting that causes automatic hard linebreaks, which is normally good, but it can be really annoying when you have a one-line json and you want to change one variable, and then vim creates 770 linebreaks. I mean they're undoable with 770J or whatever, but it causes lag and it's kind of annoying. Any ideas which settings cause this

[20:53:30] <zetty> How does one check with a package maintainer because of outdated packages (non AUR) that have been flagged as such for a kinda long time? I dont want to be that guy that just emails someone out of the blue, seems like a bad move to make.
[20:54:33] <zetty> Also, Hi, im sort of new to irc, so i may not have internalized all the mannerisms yet.
[20:55:09] <Namarrgon> is the maintainer active? did they update any of their other packages since this package was flagged?

[21:43:39] <BrainDamage> therefore barrying collisions, same id = same thing across all repos

[22:13:19] <Hello_World> Hiya! I was trying to set ALSA to use my USB microphone following https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture/Troubleshooting#Setting_the_default_microphone/capture_device . However doing that seems to also set the playback to the USB device. Changing "dmix" to a newly created pcm for the proper playback device works, but gives me "Device or resource busy" errors, and seems 
[22:13:19] <Hello_World> to try starting JACK with errors. What exactly can I do to get it to work properly?

[23:20:48] <rcf> I mean ALSA *might* not have a separate server, but I call dmix just as awful (though you don't have to use it) when invoked. 
[23:22:47] <rcf> But otherwise it's difficult to not use ALSA for internal audio hardware. Pulse et al. aren't able to bypass it, however much better things would be if they could.

[23:27:20] <rcf> And I have an intense dislike of both of them; the second-system effect is incredibly evident, and without the pulseaudio fiasco establishing once and for a 'safe' subset of the API that is usable (and debugging questionable kernel drivers by using features that were vaguely implied to exist but didn't work) it would be even worse.
