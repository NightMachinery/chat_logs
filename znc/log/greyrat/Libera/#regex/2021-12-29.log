[10:29:22] <re101-collie-33> basically i want to extract starting from Net Amount Due

[10:32:59] <karhunkynsi> https://regex101.com/r/qw0EJl/1

[10:41:32] <karhunkynsi> Yeah, i'm not sure why that is. I stumbled on this too.
[10:41:44] <karhunkynsi> And i can't seem to copy it into pattern field either..
[10:41:45] *** rebot sets mode: -q Sujeet33!*@*
[10:41:48] <purplex> when i copy and paste it, it becomes a space
[10:41:59] <karhunkynsi> A MYSTERY!
[10:43:28] <purplex> seems its \xA0
[10:44:17] <karhunkynsi> Yes.
[10:47:39] <karhunkynsi> https://regex101.com/r/qw0EJl/3
[10:48:11] <digitok> \h will match a non-breaking space
[10:49:03] <karhunkynsi> Used it in v1.
[10:49:50] <karhunkynsi> Don't know what tool/language they're using though.
[10:50:00] <digitok> ah, did not read the whole convo
[10:50:18] <digitok> yea, \xA0 = char 160 = nbsp
[10:50:26] <purplex> thx
[10:51:05] <purplex> i used it in /2 secretly
[10:51:18] <digitok> \s will match it with unicode enabled
[10:51:38] <karhunkynsi> Weird there's a nbsp before a space.
[10:51:43] <digitok> since it is pretty much including \h
[10:51:51] <digitok> yea
[10:52:42] <purplex> so true, i updated in /4
[10:53:16] <purplex> actually i prefer 61[\d,.]+ too
[10:53:32] <karhunkynsi> But WHY can't we paste it in the pattern field is the 1.5 million dollar question.
[10:54:51] <karhunkynsi> purplex: they only asked for Net amount.
[10:55:17] <purplex> yep, they will use yours
[10:55:24] <purplex> i only practice
[10:55:41] <digitok> i can paste it in the pattern field?
[10:56:15] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/qw0EJl/5
[10:56:37] <digitok> incidentally, i think the nbsp's are to prevent the spaces from being trimmed to a single space
[10:56:48] <digitok> or something like that
[10:57:08] <purplex> i can't copy from field and paste into field
[10:57:36] <digitok> no idea what you guys are doing lol
[10:57:39] <digitok> works fine here
[10:57:45] <purplex> but you must have copied from elsewhere?
[10:57:58] <digitok> i did, but it also works from the test string
[10:58:28] <purplex> wait its just firefox
[10:58:33] <purplex> works in chrome
[10:58:42] <purplex> chrome > firefox, Timvde

[15:57:28] <re101-ibis-64> The question:
[15:57:29] <re101-ibis-64> Why /[a-z]*/ when testing against "abc" string (without quotation marks) return two matches (match 1: abc, match 2: null) and not just a one match?
[15:57:29] <re101-ibis-64> Is it because it's testing against the end of line character as well, or there's something else done here which I'm not aware of?

[15:59:17] <digitok> correct
[15:59:46] <digitok> because [a-z]* will match 0 characters, it can produce another match at the end of the first match
[15:59:59] <digitok> if you change * to + you will get one match
[16:00:18] <re101-ibis-64> if I add ^ and $ as delimiter for the beginning and the end it returns correctly 1 match, but with out it, it looks like there's one more loop done at the end
[16:01:24] <re101-ibis-64> Ok. Thanks digitok.
[16:02:21] <digitok> yw, and yep, adding those anchors will prevent it from producing further matches
[16:02:40] <digitok> it will also prevent it from matching if the string contains any other chars that are not a-z
[16:02:47] <digitok> whereas the first one will match a partial string

[20:39:51] <Guest22> I have a regex sample that should not match bracket codes [asdd] with preceding (At) symbols
[20:40:02] <Guest22> ah
[20:40:04] <Guest22> that was fast lol
[20:40:35] <yitz> Or https://regex101.com/r/XRe3ml/3
[20:40:48] <yitz> You have a look ahead. I think you want a look behind
[20:42:27] <Guest22> thank you very much :D
[20:43:48] <yitz> Take note, y'all. This might be the first time I was helpful with a PCRE question. Now back to BRE and ERE land for me.
[20:45:43] <purplex> so its the first time you did a lookbehind? :p
[20:46:00] <yitz> Yes
[20:46:29] <yitz> I'm the one that sits here and yells at people to use split() calls and JSON/HTML parsers instead of PCRE.
[20:46:42] <yitz> More code, less PCRE!
[20:48:20] <purplex> i see, so split() works as a substitute whenever a lookbehind is required?
[20:49:32] <yitz> Code works as a substitute for lookbehind. Or two RE's with a logical AND
[20:50:08] <yitz> In this case, possibly a parser that understands whatever file format that it
[20:50:16] <yitz> *that is
[20:52:55] <purplex> i like json's parser using python (its just a dictionary)

[20:56:50] <purplex> really, but i thought json file always needed { } at the top level.. i think it can be [ ] too (i never used it)
[20:57:28] <yitz> It doesn't need to be an object. It just usually is.
[20:57:46] <yitz> It can be any valid JSON value
[20:58:41] <purplex> l just tried: "hello": "world" invalid json
[20:59:16] <yitz> $ python -c 'import json; print(json.loads("123")); print(json.loads("[1, 2, 3]"))'
[20:59:27] <yitz> The ":" means it's a pair/dict which needs to go inside {}
[20:59:33] <purplex> yeah [ ] will work
[20:59:51] <purplex> but str, int, can't be top level right?
[20:59:52] <yitz> The above should return an int and a list. You can also return a string, but the quoting is a pain
[21:00:02] <yitz> The first example there is an int
[21:00:16] <purplex> but in array / list, yeah
[21:00:19] <yitz> No
[21:00:24] <yitz> An int. Only an int.
[21:00:25] <purplex> oh wait first one
[21:00:42] <purplex> interesting, 123 is valid
[21:00:44] <yitz> json.loads("1"); json.loads('"hello"')
[21:00:51] <purplex> yeah that would be silly json file
[21:00:59] <yitz> Certainly
[21:01:16] <yitz> Why shove an int in a file and name it JSON when you can name it .txt
[21:01:23] <yitz> But it's still valid JSON
[21:01:51] <purplex> cool, i bet i looked it up first as well, but answer i got was its either {} or []
[21:01:58] <yitz> I've used JSON for a list of ints. You could do a list of objects ("dicts"), too.
[21:02:45] <purplex> most tutorials are wrong then to say it returns a python dictionary
[21:02:51] <yitz> What it doesn't handle, unfortunately, is JSONlines format.
[21:03:32] <yitz> Heh. Many online tutorials suck, across the board... But in most cases, JSON files *do* contain objects and json.load *usually* is a dict.

[22:59:55] <Ryex> Thanks for your response. For now only for glasses. But hopefully it can be applied to other words that are intentionally mispelled
[23:00:34] <purplex> typo can be any word, can't it?

[23:00:59] <purplex> glassses glllllassses
[23:01:07] <Ryex> or spaces. Yes correct
[23:01:12] <karhunkynsi> You could go this route, if you know all misspellings.
[23:01:25] <purplex> infinite misspellings
[23:02:23] <Ryex> Infinite misspellings will also do.
[23:02:46] <karhunkynsi> purplex will help you with that.
[23:03:02] <Ryex> Thanks +karhunkynsi!
[23:03:05] <karhunkynsi> :D
[23:03:14] <purplex> yea i think its easy
[23:03:36] <purplex> if you type 'glllllasssesss' into google it says "did you mean glasses?"
[23:03:47] <karhunkynsi> Nice!
[23:03:51] <Ryex> any regex format that would match in general any misspellings?
[23:03:55] <purplex> its some kind of algorithm, probably you can use similar.
[23:04:00] <Ryex> Yes exactly.
[23:04:40] <karhunkynsi> Implement that in regex or have your regex secretly call google.
[23:04:45] <Ryex> As much as possible since we cant disable google auto suggest/correction then I plan to match using regex for intentional typos
[23:06:07] <Ryex> Perhaps match by page title despite it being incorrectly inputted frm search
[23:06:23] <Ryex> How do we secretly call goolge for this?
[23:06:31] <Ryex> *google
[23:06:33] <karhunkynsi> I'm joking.
[23:06:43] <purplex> Google is really smart to catch it
[23:06:48] <Ryex> wahahah 😁
[23:06:54] <Ryex> yeah indeed
[23:07:07] <purplex> I tried even: glllllasussesissm
[23:07:16] <purplex> it says "did you mean glasses?"
[23:07:43] <Ryex> haha you're right.
[23:08:09] <Ryex> So was hoping to get a match for page title despite the incorrect keyword used
[23:08:44] <purplex> You can indeed secretly call google via. some API
[23:09:13] <Ryex> aside from that, can we do it with regex?
[23:09:18] <purplex> or maybe a different dictionary/spelling related service
[23:09:38] <purplex> wait, maybe a library like hunspell
[23:09:55] <purplex> with a regex its possible
[23:10:19] <Ryex> Yes I'd prefer using regex as much as possible
[23:11:16] <Ryex> do we have a way to match or disregard duplicate/triple characters?
[23:11:19] <purplex> by using regex *alone*?
[23:11:25] <Ryex> yes
[23:11:34] <purplex> not possible
[23:11:58] <purplex> it doesn't really compare words against a dictionary..
[23:12:16] <Ryex> I see. So one has to add one by one possible combinations/incorrect spellings hmmm lots of combination for that im sure
[23:13:56] <purplex> i can't see how a regex will take an invalid input from you and match it against a predicted output
