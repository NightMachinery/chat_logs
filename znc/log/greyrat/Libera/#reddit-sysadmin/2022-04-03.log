[00:18:21] <monr0e> tbf my test rig is at least a decade old, has 16gb, and chugs a bit. My more modern laptop is maybe 5 years old, has 8gb, and runs like molasses under KDE.

[23:00:51] <Cl0udNinja> oh I can just drink by myself no problem
[23:00:58] <bomb> fucking 2 years. who's gonna pay it back to me?
[23:01:22] <Cl0udNinja> but I've just not wanted to drink at all since january. the 2 beers I had were because thats basically all there was when I was out at the time
[23:01:54] <sd> 07<S‚ÄãtrongBad> @Hunterkll love it, worth it. Really really sharp
[23:02:10] <Hunterkll> hm, might be more interesting than getting the 50 
[23:02:16] <Hunterkll> i'll have to request a loaner and kick it around for a week 
[23:02:48] <bomb> Cl0udNinja that's nothing. you could inhale 2 beers worth of alcohol in my car before the pandemic BS.
[23:05:15] <Cl0udNinja> for years I used to go to this bar every saturday. was sorta like cheers, pretty much the same crowd every saturday. a guy would show up occasionally who we called 'sidebar', that had a small bar in his trunk. we'd all go out there and take a shot or two to keep our bar tabs down
[23:05:54] <bomb> that sounds super fjun
[23:05:57] <bomb> *fun even
[23:06:52] <Cl0udNinja> was good times. we used to get so fucked up there.. I knew all the bartenders, 75% or more of the people there. bullshit, drink, watch the bartenders in bikins... good times
[23:07:23] *** Quits: nuno (~user@83.223.240.121) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:07:26] <Cl0udNinja> we used to intentionally try and trigger one of the regulars, because he was just so easy to get goin..
[23:07:38] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:07:46] <Cl0udNinja> tell him any real fact and he would figure out a way to tell you you're wrong
[23:07:50] <bomb> yeah, I had a similar group
[23:08:13] <bomb> they keep doing it, but I left the city
[23:08:37] <Hunterkll> nothing bonds the regulars together like having a giant bucket of month old rank fermented smelling piss dumped on ya
[23:08:42] <Hunterkll> gotta love NYC
[23:08:45] <Cl0udNinja> a lot of the people kinda left or filtered out over the years. all the bartenders I knew left, and it was down to like 3-6 regulars, not worth while
[23:09:07] <Hunterkll> only time i've ever seen that crowd happy and eager to give their IDs to cops 
[23:09:34] <Cl0udNinja> 1) who just keeps a bucket of piss around
[23:09:42] <Cl0udNinja> 2) who the fuck throws a bucket of piss at people!?

[23:10:33] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: tenant who lived in the building above the bar apparently had been pissing in a bucket for a long time
[23:10:36] <Hunterkll> and threw it off the roof 
[23:10:38] * Telgareith idly wonders if Chia is even on any real exchanges yet

[23:10:49] <Hunterkll> and sprayed all of us doing our illegal street gambling
[23:10:52] <Cl0udNinja> thats fucking gross

[23:48:14] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> yea but how much data per sheet of paper
[23:48:34] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> can it do it in colors?
[23:48:59] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> what about the 'secret' data encoded by most/all color lasers
[23:49:51] <Cl0udNinja> it mentions B&W only
[23:50:09] <Cl0udNinja> and the pixel size + dpi, so you can easily extrapolate data; if you can math (I cant)
[23:50:39] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> I don't know  anything about its encoding
[23:51:11] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> so how much data is allocated to crc/forward error correction, who knows
[23:52:37] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> and also 600dpi isn't super dense anymore
[23:52:43] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> I think my laser can do 1200?
[23:53:09] <Cl0udNinja> extreme density would hinder decoding probabl

[23:54:22] <estranger> whytho, or just cus it's neat 
[23:54:26] <Cl0udNinja> it also mentions being able to tweak the resolution for more
