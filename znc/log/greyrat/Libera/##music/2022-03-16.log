[00:36:54] <sublim20> man, i think its been almost 2 months since quitting nicotine
[00:37:00] <sublim20> still, i crave nicotine
[00:42:30] <louipc> did u try dips
[00:43:02] <sublim20> drips
[00:43:03] <sublim20> ?
[00:43:14] <sublim20> i used to use chewing tobacco
[00:43:43] <morf> did you get cancer and stopped?
[00:43:44] <sublim20> that stuff ruins gums, i never had so much blood when brushing my teeth, as when i did
[00:43:57] <sublim20> morf, no cancer.  i just quit, cause i want to stop
[00:44:08] <sublim20> i was using nicotine pouches and chew when i stopped
[00:44:23] <sublim20> nicotine pouches are by far the best way to get nicotine, i found
[00:44:25] <morf> that's like ecgis of chewing tobacco
[00:44:47] <sublim20> that's a decent analogy
[00:45:02] <sublim20> and it was by far the best though.   didn't ruin my gums, could do it everywhere, and was cheap to do
[00:45:23] <morf> yeah 
[00:45:23] <sublim20> the only downside was the constant fear of swallowing one of them
[00:45:39] <morf> it's not the same if you don't need to spit disgusting tobacco spits everywhere
[00:45:59] <sublim20> nothing like having a gigantic cup of chew spit 
[00:46:00] <morf> you should try different body cavity then 
[00:46:06] <sublim20> and fearing knocking it over and cleaning it up
[00:46:07] <morf> :]
[00:46:23] <sublim20> well, i've heard that absorbing alcohol through the butt is great
[00:46:24] <louipc> sublim20: yea dipping tobacco
[00:46:32] <sublim20> maybe nicotine it also great

[00:46:53] <morf> nothing 
[00:47:03] <morf> i just like to smoke 
[00:47:17] <sublim20> ugh
[00:47:25] <sublim20> smoking is great though
[00:47:33] <morf> tried ecigs multiple times, but it's just not the right filthy habit 
[00:47:35] <sublim20> but once you quit, and you can smell what a smoker smells like, ugh
[00:47:42] <morf> if you don't smell like shit 
[00:47:51] <louipc> haha

[00:48:14] <louipc> if ur fingers are stained time to stop
[00:48:19] <morf> only when i smoke rolled once a lot 
[00:48:29] <louipc> if you light one cig with another cig time to stop

[00:49:05] <sublim20> oh god
[00:49:06] <morf> yeah 
[00:49:18] <morf> or 6? doesn't matter

[01:46:19] <louipc> just stop using DST then
[01:46:21] <artao> for it to be an hour off is bad
[01:46:27] <DOMF> your body doesn't know when the goddamn clock is
[01:46:33] <artao> yes it does
[01:46:33] <TXDillo> lol
[01:46:33] <DOMF> has nothing to do with that
[01:46:42] <DOMF> what does your body do that relies on a clock saying it's noon
[01:46:45] <artao> not "clock," the sun
[01:46:46] <louipc> your body doesn't care about the clock numbers
[01:46:53] <louipc> is what i think he means
[01:47:00] <artao> millions of years of evolution have tuned us to be in sync with the sun
[01:47:07] <louipc> yea the sun is whats important
[01:47:08] <artao> and NOW we wanna go change that by an hour
[01:47:15] <louipc> nah i dont wanna
[01:47:33] <louipc> and sounds like you don't wanna
[01:47:39] <artao> and it's not like DST actually "adds" any daylight anywhere. it doesn't conserve energy.
[01:47:40] <louipc> so whos the idiot doing this shite
[01:47:55] <artao> it's cutting a foot off one end of a blanket and sewing it to the other end to make the blanket longer
[01:48:00] <DOMF> we've always changed that when we change what time zones are. And where the sun is at "noon" 100% depends on your longitude
[01:48:02] <DOMF> AND your latitude
[01:48:08] <DOMF> time is a construct
[01:48:11] <louipc> say no to time zones as well
[01:48:16] <artao> local noon is dependent on longitude, yes
[01:48:18] <FreeRangeDillo> "Only a white man can cut a foot off the bottom of a blanket, & sew it onto the top of the blanket, & think he has a longer blanket -"Chief Joseph
[01:48:29] <artao> lattitude is irrelevant. that just affects how high the sun is in the sky
[01:48:32] <FreeRangeDillo> someone mentioned that in another channel :)
[01:48:37] <louipc> FreeRangeDillo: lol whats the context
[01:48:48] <louipc> is it really about dst
[01:48:48] <artao> time zones are a compromise so business can be done reasonably
[01:49:24] <artao> noon on the east side of a time zone is different (in a solar sense) from noon on the west side of a time zone
[01:49:24] <FreeRangeDillo> I don't think that's what Chief Joseph was talking about
[01:49:39] <FreeRangeDillo> but someone posted that in response to the DST news
[01:50:06] <artao> local noon tho, the sun is always due south
[01:50:20] <macrobat> time of day is socially constructed
[01:50:22] <DOMF> What affect are you claiming that anything has on your body if the sun is not due south when some arbitrary clock says it's noon
[01:50:34] <artao> the position of the sun varies only by like 20 minutes or so across a time zone
[01:50:50] <artao> confusion of circadian rhythms
[01:50:52] <louipc> FreeRangeDillo: i see "an old indian chief said"
[01:50:52] <DOMF> so 20 minutes is fine but an hour is world ending lol
[01:50:57] <louipc> re dST
[01:50:59] <artao> disconnection from natural cycles
[01:51:04] <DOMF> your circadian rhythms have fuckall to do with the clock
[01:51:12] <louipc> just some joke
[01:51:16] <FreeRangeDillo> hey, could be loupic
[01:51:16] <artao> not the clock. the sun
[01:51:22] <artao> the sun drives the clock
[01:51:24] <artao> anyhow
[01:51:26] <DOMF> yes and we're not changing anything about the sun
[01:51:34] <artao> perma-DST is the wrong direction
[01:51:37] <DOMF> we're changing the clock (or, NOT changing the clock)
[01:51:49] <artao> we're changing our relationship to the sun regarding time
[01:51:57] <FreeRangeDillo> now I'm going to have to re-adjust my sun dial?
[01:52:00] <DOMF> this is pure psychobabble
[01:52:03] <louipc> fuck the clock!
[01:52:08] <artao> FreeRangeDillo lol
[01:52:12] <louipc> we doing double time!

[01:52:40] <louipc> 120 bpm
[01:52:43] <artao> To me it's just another example of humanity disconnecting from nature
[01:52:54] <DOMF> unless you're waking/sleeping based on sunrise/sunset you're already fucking with it
[01:53:16] <louipc> no 240bpm
[01:53:20] <artao> well .... not ME personally. i don't really have a "schedule" .... my rhythms are already all fucked up FUBAR
[01:53:27] <DOMF> this is weird religious psychobabble about some mystical connection between "body" and "nature" that just doesn't exist
[01:53:33] <artao> i'm talking on a civilizaton level
[01:53:42] <macrobat> human waking activities aren't centered around noon. maybe those should be adjusted noonward
[01:53:50] <DOMF> ^^^ THIS
[01:53:55] <louipc> ppl can nap in daytime too
[01:54:02] <DOMF> I just did
[01:54:05] <louipc> woohoo
[01:54:12] <DOMF> it was great
[01:54:16] <louipc> especially if its a groggy day
[01:54:18] <artao> i admit emotional distress over the issue, which biases me
[01:54:21] <louipc> no sunbru
[01:54:25] <DOMF> it is a groggy day!
[01:54:30] <artao> DST has bugged me since i was a teen
[01:54:31] <macrobat> hours of sunlight before you wake up is underused sunlight
[01:54:34] <artao> so fucking stupid
[01:54:41] <louipc> lets switch to groggy day time
[01:54:43] <macrobat> I mean the generic you
[01:55:06] <artao> i can tell the time simply by the sun
[01:55:12] <macrobat> otoh, why does partying etc start so late in the day?
[01:55:12] <artao> usually within 15 minutes
[01:55:14] <louipc> also throw your alarms out the window
[01:55:23] <artao> DST fucks me all up on that tho
[01:55:26] <DOMF> the problem isn't how many hours before/after GMT we are, the problem is that we change this twice a year
[01:55:27] <louipc> macrobat: cuz ppl work during teh main part
[01:55:37] *** Quits: GaZ-mAnIaC (~Acheron@user/acheron) (Quit: I'm all outta GaZ !!)
[01:55:40] <louipc> or recovering from previous day's party
[01:55:47] <louipc> plus getting ready
[01:56:08] <macrobat> when do they hit the club? after 22:00?
[01:56:16] <louipc> plus u need time for the caterers to prep everything
[01:56:32] <louipc> otherwise the caterers start at midnite

[01:57:04] <sublim20> i love it when browsing used computers, and someone posts 'i paid 900$ for it!'
[01:57:18] <louipc> macrobat: yes 2100-2300
[01:57:31] <louipc> 2100 pretty damn early actually
[01:58:01] <artao> i will agreee that the biggest issue is changing the clocks twice a year
[01:58:02] <artao> sure
[01:58:13] <louipc> whats the smallest issue
[01:58:15] <artao> that needs to stop
[01:58:24] <artao> but not by perma-DST
[01:58:28] <artao> that's dumb
[01:58:41] <louipc> why
[01:58:47] <louipc> the number doesnt matter
[01:58:58] <louipc> as long as it stops changing
[01:59:08] <louipc> i mean flip flopping
[01:59:19] <macrobat> if I find someone to take home early in the evening, I don't have to suffer through hours of meaningless partying
[01:59:26] <louipc> ideally we should just be using UTC
[01:59:40] <artao> agreed
[01:59:46] <macrobat> swatch time
[01:59:47] <louipc> no need to adjust arrival/departure times for travel between timezones
[01:59:53] <artao> .... which is directly solar based, mind you
[02:00:06] <artao> or we should be using sidereal time
[02:00:07] <artao> heh heh
[02:00:09] <artao> :P
[02:00:35] <louipc> macrobat: yes i agree
[02:01:04] <morf> i don't just bcs you said it
[02:01:10] <louipc> macrobat: or you have enough time to spare to find another one for a second round
[02:01:14] <artao> i want a wrist-worn chronograph that keeps both regular and sidereal time
[02:01:18] <artao> so far i can't find one
[02:01:27] <artao> i'm sure it'd be expensive AF too tho
[02:01:42] <FreeRangeDillo> sidereal?
[02:01:50] <louipc> just get like 10 watches bro
[02:02:02] <artao> stars
[02:02:25] <louipc> whats everyones favorite bpm
[02:02:28] <artao> louipc no good. sidereal time moves at a different rate. not just any old watch can track it
[02:02:36] <DOMF> louipc: depends on the genre!

[02:03:16] <artao> oh shit
[02:03:16] <louipc> artao: correct
[02:03:31] <louipc> im not into that stuff
[02:03:41] <artao> it's after 5:30 ... cuz my clock says it's after 4:30 ... which means the pharmacy is closed and i missed picking up my meds

[02:05:49] <louipc> i dont care to pull out a phone to check time
[02:06:01] <macrobat> maybe if I knew how to replace the battery myself...
[02:06:08] <louipc> that reminds me i need a watch that glows in the dark
[02:06:19] <macrobat> kewl
[02:06:44] <louipc> replacing the battery is not difficult
[02:06:56] <louipc> just need the right tool to remove the back
[02:07:24] <louipc> or get a windup/kinetic?

[02:08:22] <macrobat> I have one of those but it is not very robust. I fear I'll break it
[02:09:08] <artao> not "earth based" but certainly from the perspective of being on the Earth

[02:41:14] <artao> beer. cigs
[02:42:17] <artao> i wnt fancy tho today. a 6-pack of Stella Artois and a 6-pack of Spaten Optimator dopple bock
[02:45:37] <artao> and GOD! yesterday playing my WW1 dogfighting game
[02:45:38] <artao> wow
[02:45:45] <artao> had an incredible experience
[02:46:03] <artao> So I was going after another plane when out of nowhere I got hit. Pretty bad
[02:46:09] <artao> my pilot too, not the plane
[02:46:44] <morf> https://lolalambchops.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2022-It-Clown-New-Year-Meme.jpg.webp
[02:46:56] <artao> the vision went narrow and monotone ... the plane was hit such that the elevators no longer really functioned ... the ailerons weren't all that great either, but at least they worked. as did the rudder
[02:47:01] <artao> so i fled for base, of course
[02:47:34] <artao> i had to use throttle to control altitude. anything less than full throttle and i'd lose altitude. ... like 20min (real time) flight back to base
[02:47:52] <artao> well ........ I managed to make it all the way back
[02:48:25] <artao> However, due to having to keep the throttle wide open to maintain altitude, most of that flight was around 5000ft ... i had to drop throttle to come down to landing altitude
[02:48:44] <artao> but, between full throttle and rapidly decending, my airspeed was like 120mph
[02:48:55] <artao> WAY too fast for a safe landing. they land at like 60mph
[02:49:42] <artao> i brought it in nice and shallow and gentle, but didn't touch down as soon as i expected and wanted to lift back up to come around again but saw that trying to do that would simply result in a crash, i tried to just go with it and hold the plane down
[02:50:05] <artao> well .......... SO close!! ...... I was fine until I hit that gorram tree and flipped over and my pilot got killed
[02:50:23] <artao> Such heroic effort to get back to base, only to be killed on landing 
[02:50:29] <artao> Awsome gaming experience
[02:50:48] <artao> At least i've (mostly) stopped ripping the wings off the planes
[02:52:30] <macrobat> there's new rammstein. idk. calmer, with more lyrics than their regular stuff
[02:53:54] <macrobat> aiui, there was heavy gyro forces in the old planes. so it was f ex easier to turn right and down or left and up
[02:57:03] <morf> in the news 
[02:57:20] <macrobat> castor oil in the fuel. pilot breathed the exhaust.
[02:57:35] <morf> some dudes printed like 2 milion euros here

[03:42:31] <artao> <macrobat> aiui, there was heavy gyro forces in the old planes. so it was f ex easier to turn right and down or left and up
[03:42:33] <artao> VERY much so
[03:42:47] <artao> especially with planes where the engine rotated along with the propeller, like the Sopwith Camel
[03:42:59] <artao> which I mistakenly tried as my first attempt with a ww1 plane
[03:43:02] <artao> BAD CHOICE
[03:43:03] <artao> lol
[03:43:08] <artao> TERRIBLE plane for noobs
[03:43:23] <artao> i have hundreds and hundreds of hours in flight sims, but mostly ww2 and jets
[03:43:39] <artao> almost zero ww1 planes, and those weren't of the modern fidelity that IL-2 has
[03:44:01] <artao> so yeah. HOLY SHIT is engine torque an issue in these fuckers!!!
[03:44:02] <artao> wow
[03:44:36] <artao> Currently I've been flying the RAF SE5 ... light scout, but one of the most succeszful planes of the war
[03:44:41] <artao> quite easy to fly really
[03:45:31] *** Joins: Glassjoe (joe@user/glassjoe)
[03:45:39] <artao> i have learned that I seem to generally prefer turning to the right for pursuit or escape .... I learned this cuz the SE5 has a left-turn torque, and I keep having to correct myself from turning right so i can turn faster (to the left)
[03:46:22] <artao> also macrobat, not castor oil in the fuel, castor oil as engine lube
[03:46:27] <louipc> so should just fly in a spiral the whole time?
[03:46:31] <artao> well .... IDK ..... perhaps the lube is in the fuel for those
[03:46:43] <louipc> wtf hows the engine rotate
[03:46:47] <artao> when you're in a dogfight that's often what happens, a spiral
[03:46:58] <artao> good question louipc
[03:47:01] <artao> crazy
[03:47:14] <artao> that's what they did tho
[03:47:20] <artao> that's what a "rotary engine" is on an airplane
[03:47:32] <artao> and here I was thinking it was like a car rotary engine
[03:47:33] <artao> NOPE
[03:47:38] <artao> totally different
[03:47:41] <louipc> oh one of those suckers
[03:47:42] <louipc> wat
[03:49:03] <artao> maintaining airspeed in a combat spiral is a real PITA in these ww1 planes i tell you what
[03:49:21] <artao> and once they stall? OUCH
[03:49:33] <artao> stall recovery in these suckers is HARD
[03:50:23] <louipc> yea how the hell u gonna do that
[03:50:37] <louipc> walk outside and flip the prop by hand
[03:51:23] <artao> no no. that's not a stall
[03:51:51] <artao> a stall is when your speed goes too low to maintain flight. or your angle of attack goes too high
[03:52:22] <artao> an ENGINE "stall" actually isn't that hard to deal with
[03:52:33] <artao> a) most planes have starter magnetos
[03:52:55] <artao> b) the airflow itself turns the propeller enough to start the engine ... IF you're travelling forward
[03:53:10] <louipc> got any good flying music

[04:01:50] <artao> Peter Jackson is apparently REALLY into ww1 planes. So much so in fact that he has a fleet of them
[04:02:09] <artao> his team builds them from scratch from the original plans. and they change NOTHING unless materials aren't available
[04:02:09] <louipc> artao: are u a junior birdman
[04:02:28] <artao> as Jackson says, "Why change anything? They were put thru their paces in combat and came out fine."
[04:02:34] <artao> senior
[04:02:35] <artao> :P
[04:02:54] <artao> i have 100s and 100s .. perhaps over 1000 ... hrs in flight sims
[04:02:56] <louipc> why wouldnt material be available?
[04:02:56] <artao> i could legit fly
[04:03:00] <louipc> asbestos or something?
[04:03:01] <artao> take off, navigate, and land
[04:03:09] <louipc> lead?
[04:03:21] <artao> asbestos and lead are till readily available :P
[04:03:22] <artao> i dunno
[04:03:24] <louipc> tazmanian devil skins?
[04:03:29] <artao> specific metalurgy perhaps
[04:03:38] <louipc> dodo beaks?
[04:04:11] <louipc> yea i know those are available but they are kinda no-no materials thsese days

[04:04:54] <artao> even COOLER is that he has them set up so they can play air combat laser tag
[04:05:56] <artao> Fun Fact: In the early war (ww1) brit pilots weren't given parachutes cuz the commanders didn't want the pilots to "just give up" and jump out of their plane
[04:05:59] <artao> ASSHOLES
[04:06:43] <artao> "Well, shit. I'm in a spin at 5000ft ... I sure hope I can pull out of it or I'm fucked" .......... "Well, shit. Dude shot out my engine. I sure hope I can glide back to base or I'm fucked"

[04:07:01] <sublim20> no remorse.  no regret.
[04:07:19] <artao> and from 5k ft if you can't pull out of that spin in like 45 seconds you're dead
[04:07:36] <louipc> whos andrew g sega
[04:07:39] <louipc> sounds legendary
[04:07:45] <artao> and pulling out of a spin in a ww1 plane is NOT as straightforward as it is in later planes
[04:07:53] <artao> i mean .... FUCK
[04:08:08] <louipc> artao: youre very fixated on this plane shit
[04:08:21] <artao> all you can do is let go of the stick and apply full rudder opposite your spin
[04:08:36] <artao> perhaps some aileron in the opposite direction
[04:08:56] <artao> and ASAP push to get your nose down to pick up forward air speed
[04:09:16] <artao> louipc well yeah. i just bought the game and have been spending most of my time the last few days playing it
[04:09:46] <louipc> does the game have some online community you can join or somethin?
[04:09:51] <artao> yep
[04:09:54] <louipc> kewl
[04:09:57] <artao> i'm not good enuf for online yet
[04:10:08] <louipc> nah just jump right in
[04:10:21] <artao> and die repeatedly
[04:10:21] <artao> heh
[04:10:27] <louipc> you can go there and drone on about music there
[04:10:34] <artao> heh
[04:10:55] <artao> i REALLY need to get head tracking up and running tho
[04:11:15] <artao> there's enuf trubbl simply flying the plane using my hands to control everything
[04:11:31] <artao> adding in controlling my view? too much
[04:11:56] <louipc> do you wear a thing on ur head
[04:12:49] <louipc> wait you can't move your head or else the screen would go out of view

[04:32:23] <artao> yes
[04:32:27] <artao> abso-fucking-lutely
[04:32:38] <artao> however, my system isn't currently working well
[04:33:06] <artao> i might just bite the bullet and stop trying to DIY head tracking and buy a fucking TrackIR system
[04:33:33] <artao> headtracking: useful in car racing, ESSENTIAL in aireal combat
[04:33:47] <artao> RN i try to use the mini-joystick on my throttle for head movement
[04:33:51] <artao> awkward, but workable
[04:33:57] <artao> that plus auto-padlock
[04:34:08] <artao> but auto-padlock can get REAL confusing REAL fast
[04:34:20] <artao> no indication of head position vs. aircraft orientation
[04:34:38] <artao> <louipc> wait you can't move your head or else the screen would go out of view
[04:35:05] <artao> with head tracking systems you can tune it so you barely have to move your head for your in-game view to change. so you don't lose fiew of the monitor
[04:35:17] <artao> it takes some getting used to but ultimately it feels pretty natural
[04:35:44] <louipc> just use WASD

[04:36:05] <artao> :P

[04:53:19] <louipc> oh god if i released everything
[04:53:20] <artao> deciding what's worth pursuing and what's not is one of the hardest things as an artist
[04:53:41] <artao> SO easy to get focussed on something and think "This is hella awesome" ........ when it's actually not
[04:54:01] <artao> That's why i like SoundCloud
[04:54:05] <artao> i can release junk then take it down

[04:55:46] <louipc> whynot artao 
[04:55:51] <artao> a) that's not the sort of music i make
[04:55:53] <artao> heh
[04:56:05] <artao> b) fuck the big rewcord labels
[04:56:10] <louipc> thats not the sort wesley willis makes either
[04:56:25] <artao> IF offered, i admit ..... I'd think about a record deal with a Big Label
[04:56:41] <louipc> you just gotta get the contract right
[04:56:46] <artao> but really? They take SOOO much control over your work it's not reasonable
[04:56:47] <louipc> no advances and shit
[04:56:51] <louipc> or you will be fucked
[04:56:59] <artao> i'm talking the Big Companies
[04:57:03] <louipc> just enough to pay rent maybe
[04:57:12] <artao> now ... something smaller like Clone Records?
[04:57:14] <artao> YES PLEASE
[04:57:29] <louipc> and food you can scratch by with gigs and record sales whatever
[04:57:33] <artao> the recording industry sucks
[04:57:40] <louipc> keep more ownership/percentages
[04:57:42] <artao> and is a fucking dinosaur that needs to die
[04:58:03] <artao> louipc i forget which country you're in. not u.s. IIRC
[04:58:25] <artao> copyright is confusing AS FUCK within any single country. but then internationally? FUCK
[04:58:38] <artao> makes someone want to ONLY do self-releaeses
[04:58:50] <louipc> sure
[04:58:51] <artao> which is what i've been doing ..... non-productively
[04:59:10] <artao> yet i hear music "on labels" that is entirely in the vein of what  i do
[04:59:11] <louipc> but then u still get sued if you have the same 6 notes as another guy
[04:59:19] <artao> LOL ikr
[04:59:23] <artao> wtf is up with that
[04:59:40] <artao> at least Led Zeppelin won that law suit over Stairway To Heaven
[04:59:46] <louipc> its because the whole idea of copyright and patents is corrupt
[05:00:34] <artao> quite so
[05:00:41] <artao> and "intellectual property"
[05:00:41] <louipc> but i do believe in honesty and attribution
[05:00:59] <artao> as an artist ....... FUCK THEM when they say that it's "for the artists' benefit"
[05:01:01] <artao> fuck off
[05:01:03] <artao> LIES
[05:01:25] <artao> oh, i agree. honesty and attribution
[05:01:33] <artao> to a degree (re: attribution)
[05:02:06] <artao> fucking ISRC numbers man
[05:02:07] <artao> FUCK
[05:02:24] <louipc> well if you are aware of the inspiration, quote, or whatever its nice to say where u got it
[05:02:26] <artao> PAY to get your music officially "catalogued"
[05:02:32] <artao> okay ... sounds fine enuf
[05:02:35] <louipc> sometimes u just dont remember or whatever
[05:02:38] <artao> BUT
[05:02:54] <artao> you literally CANNOT get your music on certain places unless you DO do that
[05:03:02] <louipc> hmm what about a decentralized catalog
[05:03:03] <artao> which (in the u.s.) costs 100 bucks
[05:03:16] <louipc> 100 bucks per wat
[05:03:20] <artao> to get an "artist's number" or some shit
[05:03:30] <louipc> oh for your whole career
[05:03:33] <artao> you get "catalogued" as an artist
[05:03:34] <artao> yeah
[05:03:40] <louipc> thats not so bad
[05:03:50] <artao> but i'm not sure if it's an annual 100 or one time
[05:04:00] <artao> but "not so bad" is saying the system is okay
[05:04:01] <louipc> but if its centrally controlled its kinda shit
[05:04:03] <artao> which it's not
[05:04:15] <artao> LOL not even centrally controlled
[05:04:17] <artao> that's just u.s.
[05:04:26] <artao> i have NO IDEA about the international situation
[05:04:30] <artao> AND
[05:04:32] <louipc> i dont know whats bad about a cataloging system
[05:04:43] <artao> to get on Spotify of Pandora or whatnot, you have to be "on a label"
[05:04:54] <louipc> ok someone should create a decentralised international, cheap cataloging system
[05:04:56] <louipc> open source
[05:04:58] <louipc> open api
[05:05:02] <artao> to be on a label means you have to pay that ISRC fee, and THEN pay moar fees to be on the label ........ etc
[05:05:08] <louipc> hosting fees still cost money tho
[05:05:13] <artao> eventually you pay more fees than you make on your music
[05:05:31] <artao> in my digital music career i've made $25 usd
[05:05:43] <louipc> you dont need to pay if you make your own system tho ;)
[05:05:49] <artao> over like 8 yrs when i first put stuff up for pay
[05:05:50] <louipc> and ppl see the advantage of it
[05:06:00] <louipc> and then your awesome system becomes the dominant one
[05:06:04] <louipc> and everyone rejoices
[05:06:10] <artao> as a busker over like 5 yrs i made several thousand dollars
[05:06:29] <louipc> yea digital is more competitive
[05:06:30] <artao> internet busking exists .... but .............. FUCK
[05:06:38] <louipc> busk in the metaverse?
[05:06:39] <artao> no, not "more competitive"
[05:06:44] <artao> more restrictive and random
[05:07:02] <artao> how do people get listened to? .......... algorithms?

[05:07:18] <louipc> yes

[05:16:11] <artao> such a GREAT fucking movie!!!
[05:16:32] <louipc> did dick try to put on a weak british accent there
[05:16:56] <artao> louipc have you seen the flash mob for him?
[05:17:08] <artao> hey now!! not a "weak" brit accent
[05:17:12] <louipc> nope
[05:17:13] <artao> he did waht he could eh :P
[05:17:15] <artao> oh wow

[05:17:36] <louipc> a tribute or something?
[05:17:54] <artao> quite
[05:18:00] <louipc> i hate flashmobs relly
[05:18:27] <artao> it is kinda dumb, agreed
[05:18:28] <louipc> if i ever see one in real life i might start yelling shut up
[05:18:30] <artao> but sometimes?
[05:18:47] <louipc> "shut the fuck up!"

[05:22:04] <artao> it was unknown to him, but organized by people he knows
[05:22:29] <artao> somewhere out there is a video of people directing him out to the balcony to find the flash mob

[07:19:30] <louipc> the art of frog licking by artao
[07:19:36] <artao> Possibly The Greatest Female superhero ever
[07:19:57] <artao> i disagree sdragon re: awkwardly
[07:20:05] <artao> i mean ...... I get what you're saying
[07:20:11] <artao> but they HAD TO finish shit up

[07:20:37] <artao> What now happens when a slayer dies?
[07:20:41] <louipc> wasnt buffy some teen girl show
[07:20:44] <artao> Where do all the slayers go?
[07:20:53] <louipc> like an older take on twilight
[07:20:59] <artao> How many Hellmouths are there around the world?
[07:21:04] <sdragon> louipc: yes and no, but mostly no
[07:21:06] <louipc> or twilight is a new take on buffy
[07:21:06] <artao> louipc shaddup
[07:21:07] <artao> :P
[07:21:19] <artao> buffy is ....... buffy
[07:21:21] <rindolf> artao: my fav slayer was Faith

[07:21:36] <artao> really?
[07:21:48] <sdragon> Faith x Buffy
[07:22:01] <artao> i mean ......... quite the character arc .... sure ........................ but it's all redemption
[07:22:15] <artao> and she never quite really gets redemption for what she did
[07:22:22] <artao> NOR SHOULD SHE imo
[07:22:43] <artao> faith should not have lived
[07:22:45] <louipc> teen girl soap opera drama lol
[07:22:45] <sdragon> Okay, but-- and hear me out on this--
[07:22:49] <artao> louipc no
[07:22:51] <artao> LOL no
[07:22:55] <louipc> yes
[07:23:00] <sdragon> Eliza Dushku in eyeliner and tight jeans
[07:23:00] <artao> you can't know til you watch it
[07:23:13] <louipc> i know already
[07:23:14] <artao> i also felt the same way about it and even ridiculed friends who watched it
[07:23:35] <artao> to a Buffy noob i recommnd starting with season 4 actually
[07:23:39] <louipc> then ur ballz fell off
[07:23:53] <rindolf> louipc: BtVS was popular among both genders
[07:23:58] <sdragon> 4? Really?
[07:24:00] <artao> pretty sure i still have those, tho i never really use em
[07:24:12] <sdragon> Why?
[07:24:17] <artao> sdragon yes really
[07:24:28] <artao> cuz season 1 is ....... hard
[07:24:35] <artao> doesn't make you want to watch more
[07:24:47] <sdragon> And Riley does?
[07:24:50] <artao> the Get into the Flow in season 2 ......... BUT
[07:25:04] <artao> you can't just "pick up" in s2
[07:25:19] <artao> the whole high school plot line
[07:25:23] <artao> SO
[07:25:27] <artao> start with s4
[07:25:47] <artao> THEN! after s4, go back and watch s1 - 3
[07:25:58] <sdragon> Yeah, no

[07:26:22] <sdragon> You are mythtaken, artao 
[07:26:52] <sdragon> No worse than 4

[07:27:12] <artao> everyone is still gettin their stride and such
[07:27:25] <artao> by s4 they've got it nailed, and it's a new story 
[07:27:41] <artao> s1 thru s3 are "the high school story"
[07:28:01] <artao> which can be reasonably skipped
[07:28:08] <rindolf> just like the Muppet show or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic

[07:28:21] <artao> cuz honestly? s1 - s3 aren't up to snuff of the later seasons
[07:28:27] <louipc> man fuck hollywood. such mind poison
[07:28:29] <sdragon> Yeah, I disagree with being reasonably able to skip those seasons
[07:28:33] <artao> LIES
[07:28:41] <artao> ehh fair nuf
[07:28:44] <artao> for a NOOB tho
[07:29:18] <louipc> making everyone ridiculously stupid
[07:29:23] <artao> Struggle thru the show hitting its stride, or just jump right to the good stuff?
[07:29:33] <sdragon> Regardless of how you might feel about the quality of the production for those seasons, they're necessary for the story
[07:29:52] <artao> sure
[07:30:08] <artao> tho post-HS buffy doesn't often reference pre-HS buffy
[07:30:27] <artao> not until LATE
[07:30:35] <sdragon> Yes it does
[07:30:40] <artao> not really
[07:30:56] <artao> the Hellmouth remains, sure
[07:31:19] <artao> but everything HS is just ........... <shrug> irrelephant
[07:31:44] <artao> you can watch seasons 4 thru 7 and miss nothing
[07:31:51] <artao> without 1 thru 3
[07:32:16] <sdragon> You miss the explanation for why there's more than one slayer
[07:32:25] <artao> no.
[07:32:29] <artao> no i did not
[07:32:40] <sdragon> Yes

[08:02:40] <artao> overpriced IMO
[08:02:56] <sdragon> Maybe a bit

[08:03:27] <artao> to me Teenage Engineering kinda seems ...... well ........ a "hipster" brand
[08:03:34] <artao> and they charge accordingly
[08:03:53] <sdragon> Yeah, I get that, absolutely
[08:05:50] <sdragon> With a MPC, I'd be able to make remixes of my older stuff
[08:06:08] <artao> or with any other modern software and hardware

[08:07:55] <artao> i KNEW i shoulda bought vodka instead
[08:08:02] <sdragon> People complain about modern MPC's being just a DAW-in-a-box, but that's what I like about it
[08:08:18] <artao> i got maintenance guys coming tomorrow tho, so i MUST be awake

[08:15:55] <artao> Get paid to simply be on cam?
[08:15:56] <sdragon> Ideally, I'd like to get a decent DSLR with stereo audio in, so I could send my audio signal directly into the camera
[08:15:58] <artao> YES PLEASE
[08:16:28] <artao> LOL that's a pricey endeavor sdragon
[08:16:49] <artao> to do that one generally buys the camera and mic separately
[08:17:52] <sdragon> I was watching some YouTube video that had adult cam workers. One of them was just some guy practicing violin on cam, and he found out that he can get paid for doing that without clothes
[08:18:02] <morf> artao, artao
[08:18:04] <artao> DOOD
[08:18:19] <artao> i'm arguably a Chaturbate addict
[08:18:24] <artao> one lady?
[08:18:35] <artao> she paid for a record deal with her CB
[08:18:40] <sdragon> artao: yeah, it really is a pricey endeavor hahahahaha
[08:19:31] <sdragon> But if my music sells...
[08:19:51] <artao> IKR
[08:19:52] <artao> if
[08:20:29] <artao> the thing is, these days .......... "music" doesn't "sell"
[08:20:35] <artao> it's all streaming
[08:20:41] <artao> jplays sell
[08:20:51] <artao> and you have to pay to get plays
[08:21:10] <sdragon> I mean, if you wanna listen to my music on Spotify, it's there, too
[08:21:24] <artao> lucky 
[08:21:28] <sdragon> I'm not here to tell you how to listen to your music
[08:21:31] <artao> via where?
[08:21:41] <sdragon> DistroKid
[08:21:42] <artao> how did you get on spotify?
[08:21:44] <artao> YEP
[08:21:50] <artao> i expected that answer
[08:21:55] <sdragon> Love 'em
[08:21:57] <artao> i'm torn with them
[08:22:06] <artao> have you found it to be worth it?
[08:22:12] <sdragon> Yes
[08:22:27] <artao> you stop paying them, your music disappears
[08:22:57] <artao> the "get played" industry is SO FUCKED
[08:23:05] <sdragon> You can buy the "Leave a Legacy" add-on
[08:23:28] <artao> compared to the general music industry,  distrokid sounds awesome
[08:23:38] <artao> BUT
[08:23:43] <artao> is there a but?
[08:23:58] <sdragon> Your music stays, even if your card expires
[08:24:02] <artao> the music industry dinosaur has SO MUCH CONTROL
[08:24:43] <artao> all i gotta do is drop 100 bucks to get an ISRC 
[08:25:03] <sdragon> If I put out a four song EP each year, DistroKid is definitely worth it for me
[08:25:06] <artao> but that rattles my anti-corp bones
[08:26:08] <sdragon> SongTrust helps, too
[08:26:18] <artao> i have SO MUCH music beign held back in hopes of getting a recording contract
[08:26:26] * sublim20 takes his shirt off
[08:26:30] <sublim20> WHO WANTS TO FIGHT
[08:26:36] <artao> i should just give that up and start releasing my music
[08:26:54] * sdragon gives sublim20 a purple nurple
[08:27:02] <sublim20> I SURRENDEr
[08:27:03] * artao kicks sublim20 in the diaghram
[08:27:04] <sublim20> you win!

[08:27:36] * artao forces sublim20 to suck sdragon's chode
[08:27:48] <sdragon> artao: yes, you should just release it!
[08:28:11] <artao> i have HOURS of "nearly ready" music 
[08:28:18] <artao> literally
[08:28:26] <sdragon> Finish them
[08:28:33] <artao> okay
[08:28:37] <artao> which one?
[08:29:03] <sdragon> Pick one, finish it. Then pick another one, and finish that one
[08:29:10] <artao> exactly
[08:29:12] <sdragon> Keep going
[08:29:20] <artao> it's the pcking that's the problem
[08:29:24] <artao> which one?
[08:29:31] <sdragon> Doesn't matter
[08:29:36] <sdragon> Just pick one
[08:29:40] <artao> some aren't even worth pursuing
[08:29:50] <artao> i DO do that sdragon
[08:29:55] <sdragon> You might be surprised
[08:30:10] <artao> but how am i to know which of them is "worth it" in a public sense
[08:30:27] <sdragon> Trust your own tastes
[08:30:31] <artao> are you familiar with my work?
[08:30:40] <artao> prolly not
[08:30:43] <sdragon> Are you familiar with mine?
[08:30:52] <artao> "trust my own tastes" is ...... u8
[08:31:04] <artao> not that i recall sdragon
[08:31:07] <artao> share?
[08:31:15] <sdragon> It's... what?
[08:31:36] <artao> I am Voxonitus
[08:31:39] <artao> period
[08:31:57] <sdragon> Spotify? BandCamp? Got a preference?
[08:32:02] <artao> i spent a LOT of time making sure that my music is ALL you get from a search
[08:32:25] <artao> simply search "Voxonitus" and you'll get me
[08:32:40] <artao> if it's NOT me, let me know
[08:32:41] <sdragon> No, I mean, you asked me to share my stuff
[08:32:45] <artao> OH
[08:32:50] <artao> link?
[08:33:03] <artao> or description (like I said)
[08:33:10] <sdragon> Got a preference for what service?
[08:33:16] <artao> for me? Voxonitus will find my music
[08:33:30] <artao> doesn't matter where

[08:41:20] <artao> corn is a major international commodity
[08:41:40] <morf> i mean their expert of grain is 30% of global grain trade
