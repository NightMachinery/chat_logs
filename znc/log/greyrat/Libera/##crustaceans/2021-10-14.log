[01:12:50] <imode> what happened.
[01:13:11] <imode> I should clarify: what happened _now_.

[02:35:52] <dimadima> factorial(n)?
[02:35:59] <imode> yup.
[02:36:05] <imode> currently it computes factorial(5).
[02:36:29] <dimadima> is thie performant? it looks really... long
[02:36:44] <imode> yup!
[02:36:54] <imode> about as performant as you're going to get with the optimizations involved.
[02:37:10] <imode> bear in mind this is not "idiomatic FV3".
[02:37:33] <imode> it was transcribed from brainfuck.
[02:38:26] <dimadima> imode: stupid question no doubt

[02:39:51] <imode> it's relevant, I promise.
[02:39:54] <dimadima> yeah i speak russian
[02:40:06] <imode> do you find yourself "thinking" in russian and then translating things into english?
[02:40:39] <dimadima> other way, sadly
[02:40:55] <dimadima> russian first language, but living in the states since i was 5
[02:41:12] <dimadima> i do arithmetic and multiply sometimes in russian. but that's all too much information
[02:41:19] <dimadima> https://i.imgur.com/chwMeSB.png
[02:41:41] <dimadima> oh lol found how to share a link https://godbolt.org/z/af6ThnYsq
[02:41:42] <buttsbot> Compiler Explorer
[02:41:52] <imode> a lot of people do for languages they learned second rather than first. in many cases, the translations, because the mapping between both languages doesn't _always_ preserve the information about context, you end up with really verbose translations that sound "off" but are correct.
[02:42:21] <dimadima> but the difference between my link and yours is staggering?
[02:42:42] <dimadima> this is like if something was a few words in english but a podcast episode in russian
[02:43:08] <dimadima> i wouldn't be surprised if very little of that code was run
[02:43:15] <dimadima> since you said it's performant, after all
[02:43:23] <imode> that's correct. because my compiler doesn't optimize for much (yet), and is doing a literal translation between FV3 instructions and C instructions with _some_ optimizations, it's much larger.
[02:43:36] <dimadima> gotcha
[02:43:48] <dimadima> hope you obivosuly understand that none of this is criticism or something, just curioristy
[02:43:51] <imode> meaning because my understanding of how FV3 maps to C is "incomplete", a lot of the structural stuff around this factorial function gets translated literally.
[02:44:01] <imode> oh no no, this is some of the first steps behind building an optimizing compiler. :)
[02:45:06] <dimadima> very cool
[02:45:07] <imode> if you ever used the tritium brainfuck compiler (really cool btw) and fed the factorial function through it, you'd find that it is _longer_ than a traditional factorial function.
[02:45:13] <imode> in fact, let me grab that.
[02:45:16] <imode> this is fun.
[02:45:29] <dimadima> i should say my wife is feeding my child so not working right now is inducing guilt

[03:01:06] <imode> bugh. sorry dude.
[03:01:13] <dimadima> naa it's okay i'm not complaining
[03:01:29] <dimadima> the result, especially on iOS, which i focused on in terms of mobile, has been great
[03:01:38] <dimadima> i'm really pleased to have only one codebase, too
[03:02:10] <dimadima> i think this approach can be pushed really far. only really insurmountable problem is that iOS reduces webview to 30fps in low power mode
[03:02:33] <dimadima> trade-offs
[03:03:12] <dimadima> anyway i'm not even doing iOS now, just trying to made a landing page video; hence the sceenflow youtube video

[16:14:36] <ngoldbaum> why read a release announcement for a project you’ve never heard of
[16:22:14] <kline> in case it turns out to be useful
[16:24:40] <ngoldbaum> and then complain about it afterwards when it turns out not to be?

[16:36:50] <skyl4rk> Honestly, no, I will not google a random product name to see if it's interesting, just because I saw it in some headline. Also I did not say that I would complain about it, just that I see where they are coming from, wrt want ing a little more context.
[16:38:09] <ngoldbaum> fwiw i wasn’t responding to you, i was responding to chisnall, sorry didn’t realize it read like i was criticizing you
[16:39:00] <ngoldbaum> if you get to the point where you read the release announcement and you don’t know what the project is but you then comment on lobste.rs complaining about it, that’s the insane thing

[17:22:47] <dimadima> i quit coffee for 6 months. the desire to drink it never went away. it's hard to stay quit from because there's no, like, obvious cancers or something like that
[17:22:55] <dimadima> and i do love coffee
[17:23:27] <gerikson> unless it gives me IBS I'm never gonna quit
[17:23:33] <dimadima> yep
[17:24:02] <dimadima> my mom got IBS from coffee, quit for a few months, or went down to 1 cup per day for a while, then was able to scale back up to 2-3 after a while

[17:41:16] <gwozniak> Of course, I'm used to them, so maybe that's why I like them

[21:13:27] <imode> the fucking worst part is the actual tech behind these NFTs.
[21:13:45] <imode> the backing contract just sits on the ETH chain or whatever else chain, maintaining a map of owners.

[21:31:43] <hoistbypetard> late to that party, but gwozniak, an old friend of mine who used to roast coffee professionally held that his highest duty as a roaster was owed to those who drank coffee made from his decaffeinated beans, because they were only in it for the taste and often in it despite one or more large obstacles, and he felt it was his obligation to make his decaf roast his best-tasting one.

[21:35:12] <imode> that's n-sync lmao.
[21:36:21] <hoistbypetard> he is no longer involved in the operation for quite some time now, but this is its successor, roasted by people who still say that: https://counterculturecoffee.com/shop/coffee/collection-slow-motion-decaf
[21:36:23] <buttsbot> Slow Motion – Decaf - Counter Culture Coffee
[21:37:10] <hoistbypetard> it is not, IMO, their best-tasting roast, but it is so good I will voluntarily consume it despite the lack of caffeine
[21:45:29] <Brekkjern> I don't understand why people drink coffee :S
[21:46:53] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[21:50:26] <gwozniak> hoistbypetard: I have intentionally avoided decaf just in case, but it's been a while so I might give it a shot some time
[21:51:19] <imode> good coffee is its own reward but I dislike caffeine.
[21:53:34] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: wakes me up; makes me poop
[21:53:48] <indigo> Brekkjern: Do you drink caffeine?
[21:53:59] <Brekkjern> indigo: Yes
[21:54:16] <Brekkjern> But the caffeine I drink actually tastes good
[21:54:29] <indigo> Tea, I'm guessing? :D
[21:54:33] <Church> gwozniak: Heh my mate just got gifted an NFT
[21:54:36] <Brekkjern> Energy drinks :P
[21:54:42] <Brekkjern> Sugar free ones though
[21:54:45] <Church> I'ma print it on shirts and devalue it
[21:54:47] <hoistbypetard> my coffee actually tastes good...
[21:55:31] <imode> Church: people would argue that that increases its value.
[21:55:51] <indigo> Oooh
[21:55:58] <indigo> I was always a big fan of Bawls energy drink
[21:56:18] <imode> you enjoy suckin' down some Bawls?
[21:56:26] <hoistbypetard> gwozniak: i wasn't trying to encourage a return to coffee so much as trying to suggest one that would be tasty to try if you liked coffee before and thought decaf was safe :)
[21:58:13] <indigo> imode: Hell yeah dude
[21:58:36] <imode> hellll yeah.
[22:07:01] <imode> hm.
[22:07:21] <imode> well, compiler works.
[22:07:51] <imode> the transcribed factorial program returns 208 for factorial 6, which is expected since it wraps on byte boundaries. but it throws the original interpreter into a loop.
[22:08:23] <imode> oh it's because I don't have enough cells.
[22:12:46] <imode> well that's good at least.
[22:20:37] *** Quits: river (~river@tilde.team/user/river) (Quit: Leaving)

[22:42:59] <indigo> I have no energy left for code at the end of the day :P
[22:43:14] <imode> builds take 20 minutes on average.
[22:43:43] <Brekkjern> It's "amazing" that the OpenBSD 7.0 release thread has 41 votes and 1 comment...
[22:43:56] <imode> and I want to use this as an actual language environment some day, so.
[22:44:12] <Brekkjern> I kinda want the Ubuntu release thread to overtake it, just for shiggles...
[22:44:20] *** Joins: pja (~pja@217.155.153.10)
[22:44:39] <Brekkjern> But I kinda doubt it. It's at 5 votes in 1 hour, while the OpenBSD thread is at 41 votes in 5 hours.
[22:46:50] <dmc> I should've grilled something today
[22:46:55] <dmc> 78 F out of nowhere
[22:47:08] <dmc> 77 tomorrow
[22:56:35] <indigo> Oof, 20 minute builds. Context switching sucks
[22:58:15] <imode> yeeeah.
[22:58:17] <imode> yeah it does.
[22:58:25] <imode> 20 minute builds, deployments, test adjustments.
[22:58:30] <ngoldbaum> ccache helps sometimes
[22:58:42] <ngoldbaum> if this is C/C++
[22:58:46] <imode> it is not. it is java.
[22:58:54] <imode> and it's also backed by amazon's build system.
[22:58:55] <ngoldbaum> gross
[22:58:59] <imode> which is a ten ton beast.
[22:59:08] <imode> that fills your hard disk to the brim with cached packages.
[22:59:49] <ngoldbaum> the day a recompile first took 3 seconds instead of 15 minutes because of ccache was a good day
[23:00:10] <imode> I would've cried.
[23:01:51] <companion_cube> hmmmmm
[23:02:09] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: do you have a quick intro to that? :s
[23:02:15] <companion_cube> I've spent the day recompiling z3
[23:02:34] <ngoldbaum> it’s pretty simple but also magic in a way where if it’s
[23:02:42] <ngoldbaum> not working it can be hard to figure out why
[23:03:31] <ngoldbaum> but basically you do `CC=“ccache gcc” make`
[23:03:33] <companion_cube> do you export CC
[23:03:35] <companion_cube> oh my
[23:03:53] <drakonis> CC...
[23:03:59] <ngoldbaum> it also uses some hard drive space
[23:04:07] <ngoldbaum> to store the cached object files
[23:04:15] <ngoldbaum> and it doesn’t help speed up linking
[23:04:42] <ngoldbaum> one way to speed up linking is to use llvm’s ld which is hilariously faster than gcc’s and is a drop-in replacement
[23:05:19] <indigo> Well, look at the bright side imode, at least you still write code
[23:05:56] <imode> true. on my own time.
[23:09:29] <Church> ngoldbaum: Yeah ccache and scache are great
[23:09:39] <Church> scache super helped rust build times
