[01:25:58] <ProfSimm> Decker: yes, well for me quoted or not quoted is allowed but they're two distinct types (name vs text)
[01:26:12] <ProfSimm> Decker: still compatible tho
[01:26:38] <Decker> ProfSimm ya - I'm heading more to any string is a string - strings can be used as names
[01:27:01] <Decker> if strings don't require quotes because they don't contain anything seprating them into seprate tokens they don't need quotes
[01:27:26] <ProfSimm> Decker: my type system is such that 1 is an int but also a float.

[01:28:22] <ProfSimm> Decker: i.e. to use text operations to dynamically construct a name
[01:28:33] <ProfSimm> Decker: you know, it's problematic when you wanna optimize names away as registers
[01:28:34] <duuude> Intelo: it depends on what you consider best
[01:28:42] <Decker> ... like const a ="blah"; obj[a] ?
[01:28:50] <duuude> some say JCL, some say J
[01:29:13] <Decker> ProfSimm makes it hard to support dynamice data like JSON as an input :)  have to encode everything into static objects - like a value type
[01:29:24] <ProfSimm> Decker: i.e. I don't want to have variable 'foo' and allow someone to take input from user 'foo' and read the variable. 
[01:30:08] *** Joins: SadPepe (~SadPepe@user/SadPepe)
[01:30:11] <Decker> well - other than the top level object refernce; JS has no qualms about that - but only works for accessing a property within a value
[01:30:20] <ProfSimm> Decker: but maybe I'm just being pointlessly purist here. in JS the names are tucked away in the hidden classes, they don't burden objects too much
[01:30:57] <ProfSimm> Decker: that said in JS also you can't access "let foo" by having foo as a string
[01:31:03] <Decker> right
[01:31:28] <ProfSimm> Decker: for me this is an issue because object field and var name is the same thing

[02:15:43] <nomagno> That is, when you pass the arguments x, y and z to S, S returns ((x(z))(y(z))
[02:16:08] <nomagno> The I combinator is the identity function, and is syntactic sugar for (SKK)
[02:17:23] <nomagno> when you pass any argument x to it, you get SKKx, which reduces to Kx(Kx), which reduces to x
[02:17:58] <nomagno> So Ix = x, that is I = func(x) { return x; }

[04:14:05] <nitrix> Yeah, static languages can reject correct programs. TypeScript had a lot of issues with that and it drove me insane. 
[04:14:59] <flakland> pop is undefined, or acc is?
[04:16:05] <nitrix> The pop would be undefined when acc is an empty array/list.
[04:16:13] <PlanckWalk> pop() probably has some type like  ElementType | undefined
[04:16:36] <nitrix> A stack-like data structure can run out of elements to pop.
[04:16:37] <PlanckWalk> This is why a lot of type systems have overrides
[04:17:21] <nitrix> That, or they become runtime constraints.
[04:17:31] <PlanckWalk> "Yes I know that sometimes pop() is undefined, but in this case it is not."
[04:18:07] <KillerWasp> exist array/vector/list class in C++, i don't know which have pop() function. but don't exist on all.
[04:18:11] <nitrix> Dependent types solve this, at the cost of making the language significantly more complex.
[04:18:26] <flakland> sounds like it should just be a generic type of error/exception
[04:18:40] <flakland> and you should just avoid calling pop on an empty object
[04:19:22] <PlanckWalk> "Should just do the right thing" isn't really the point of type systems

[08:34:04] <arahael> smallvil_: Apple already have quite a few gestures for their trackpads, though those don't use distances.  Just fingers and in some cases, movements.
[08:34:21] <duuude> If you mean like, making movements gestures for an action, like drawing a shape with its movement, that is realistic to implement, but still impractical
[08:34:40] <duuude> key's are more motion-efficient, for lack of a better word
[08:34:44] <duuude> keys
[08:34:47] <arahael> Would "handwriting recognition" be a form of this?
[08:35:00] <arahael> If so, then that might qualify.
[08:35:10] <duuude> thought of that too
[08:35:47] <duuude> and there is a reason we still use virtual keyboards on our phones, instead of handwriting

However, the company saw "mobile phones", and decided to leave their niche and follow the mobile phones market.  They were not good at mobile phones.  The same input mechanism didn't work well either for other devices, due to differences in technology.  It was really well suited for the particular input they
[08:39:07] <arahael> had.
[08:39:30] <duuude> sonny: it is impressive, but less useful. your fingers would work a lot more to write a sentence than using a qwerty keyboard
[08:39:44] <sonny> that's why it had a stylus
[08:39:58] <sonny> fingers is novel, but only so novel
[08:40:03] <sonny> stylus is better
[08:40:15] <duuude> then you can only hold it with one hand
[08:40:42] <sonny> worked for me
[08:40:42] <duuude> limiting the ways you could comfortably hold it
[08:41:02] <duuude> was it one of those 9-key feature phones?
[08:41:04] <sonny> phones aren't comfortable to hold anymore either
[08:41:09] <arahael> duuude: Which just happens to be the most natural way to hold it.  Not many people like to hold it in their teeth, or their feet, etc.  Certainly not in the eye sockets...

[09:04:57] <InPhase> ent58: You generally want to do that sort of thing where there's a "natural" boundary.
[09:04:59] <ent58> I think maybe in our quest to specialize harder and harder in the general pursuit of knowledge, some of that has bled into social sphere
[09:05:49] <InPhase> ent58: Or sometimes, force it by architectural changes so that a natural boundary emerges.  Such forced natural boundaries tend to have a compactness property, where the interface is substantially simpler than the behavior being interfaced with.
[09:06:47] <ent58> InPhase yeah designing smart interfaces takes some thinking about, but I find as long as you have an agreed upon data format, you can vastly simplify interfaces
[09:07:51] <ent58> One of the things I wanted to use this for was, along with having large chunks of functionality (brand new or modular updates), having small dynamic modules that are designed to be completely blown away and re-written and reloaded on a frequent basis
[09:08:40] <ent58> Say, a program that ships with its source code, and in the program itself, you can bring up the source and modify that function....reload it, and execute it, similar to an internal scripting environment
[09:09:28] <InPhase> ent58: There's a bit of a dark art to it.  As soon as you've gone and designed such an interface, you are making some future changes elegant, and other future changes very awkward or cumbersome.  So you want to make sure those things you just made hard to do are not likely to be the things you're going to end up needing to do.
[09:12:13] <InPhase> ent58: I've done code modification, but typically if you want some well-defined behavior, you want to lock down the scope of what can be modified.  Otherwise it's basically impossible to reason about what the program is going to do.  At that point you've basically just written a self-destructive repl.
[09:12:59] <ent58> Yeah, so my grand vision is completely specified self modifying code, this is sort of a high-level coarse grained version of that
[09:13:11] <ent58> to serve as a practical buildable-now example
[09:13:50] <ent58> One of the things I wanted to make sure of was that I wasn't duplicating code over and over again
[09:14:17] <ent58> I'd want to make these shared objects as small as they can be, and have them correctly be able to point at code already loaded
[09:15:28] <ent58> I know there's the link-time shared object loading pattern with an import static library, but I can't really leverage that

[09:46:25] <arahael> It all depends on how the runtime is implemented.
[09:46:36] <ent58> this could be applied to things like library shared objects
[09:46:38] <arahael> It might even care that a() exists, after compilation.
[09:46:46] <arahael> Might *not* even care, that iis.
[09:46:48] <ent58> so if the core program loads a.dll

[09:52:34] <arahael> Decker: That makes sense, actually.  Now you mention it, I can't imagine how it would NOT do the same!
[09:52:44] <Decker> arahael ya :)
[09:52:56] <Decker> it's not required
[09:53:08] <ent58> arahael: I can totally see it not doing that, and instead having a conventionally agreed upon symbol akin to main that is called manually/via library
[09:53:36] <Decker> DLLMain you have to have somewhere; it is a required entry point that doesn't really do anything than give a library its own HINSTANCE
[09:54:07] <ent58> Right, it's not meant to do any heavy lifting
[09:54:09] <arahael> ent58: That would have significant problems with say, C++ or any other non-trivial globals.
[09:54:26] *** Joins: mfiano (~mfiano@cpe-67-240-71-179.nycap.res.rr.com)
[09:54:59] <arahael> However, that'd probably still the case...?
[09:55:11] <Decker> but anyway :) there really isn't a lot of difference, no.  LoadLibrary returns a Handle, dlopen returns a pointer to the start of the memory loaded in memory
[09:55:31] <Decker> (of the library loaded in memory)
[09:55:59] <Decker> then GetProcAddress and dlopen both search through the exported symbols table
[09:56:07] <Decker> (err dlsym)
[09:56:55] <Decker> but - they are alphabetically sorted, and have a fixed length so you can do a binary index search starting in the middle and doing (min+mid)/2  or (mid+max)/2 depending on the side
[09:57:12] <ent58> So I think if I boil down what I'm asking, you build an application that has a shared object version of libc loaded. If you dynamically load a shared object, the only way the system loader fills in functions you use that are already loaded is if you build that dll with a static import library of symbols you use....so you'd build "a.dll" with libc,
[09:57:12] <ent58> that would retrieve the same functions the core program uses for fopen/printf/stdlib and friends

[09:59:12] <Decker> so main is libc.so and a.dll is libc.a ?
[09:59:27] <Decker> and a.dll is dynamically loaded?
[10:01:25] <ent58> main program links with libc.so via load time linking (on windows this is a libc.a that statically defines symbols searched by the system loader?), main program loads a.so/dll linked with static import library/libc.so
[10:01:40] <nitrix> I was wondering recently if a sufficiently clever compiler could link a dynamic library statically. In its most absurd form, the file could be embedded, extracted at runtime and then dlopen'ed, so surely a cleaner method could be devised. Same thing with loading static libraries at runtime, the memory locations can be patched, just like executable loaders already do.
[10:02:03] <ent58> this is so functions in a.dll are operating off of code already loaded, perhaps only duplicating a symbol/import table
[10:03:04] <Decker> well... .dll's define their relocations relative to their own locations; if you patched it into another executablef ile all of those relocations would also have to be changed
[10:03:14] <Decker> which may require different instructions depending on the distances things moved
[10:04:01] <Decker> so it's not really practical to tread a .dll/.so as a .a and link it.   (linux just uses the .so which has the eport library builtin; C# Pinvoke also just builds against the .dll and doesn't need the .lib exports)
[10:04:27] <Decker> .lib is actually mostly deprececated - it was used more when entry points in dynamic librarys were specifed by ordinal and not name

[10:05:23] <nitrix> Myeah. It just seems like a more carefully designed library format in tandem with a good executable loader would've been really cool.
[10:06:50] <arahael> In many ways, that's COM, and COM is, imho, pretty good.
[10:06:51] <nitrix> Maybe even document the calling convention and have the tooling at the OS level to do FFI between programming languages.
[10:06:54] <ent58> Back in a bit...but yeah I'm not trying to use a .so like a static lib, I'm trying to make sure that every dll I load uses the same code when I call printf(), and it does that via either the system loader recognizing symbol dependencies (.so has import built in, on windows you build a .a in with references but no code), or maintaining your own

[10:07:33] <arahael> nitrix: That's the main thing. There needs to be a calling convention, which is exactly what many languages seem unwilling to define except for C's FFI.
[10:08:16] <Decker> ent58 I build a structure of function points, and use that... then just fill in the function table once during init
[10:08:40] <Decker> it would be nice if there were more automated tools that would extract type signatures and stuff and build that table
[10:09:00] <arahael> To be honest, this is one reason I love Rust.
[10:09:05] <ent58> So thinking about it Decker, that actually seems like the more efficient option as otherwise I'm forcing the system loader to build a table to every other dll in its own module
[10:09:24] <ent58> I'm eating an indirect jump anyway
[10:09:26] <ent58> might as well
[10:09:29] <arahael> Rust has bindgen and cbindgen, and those seem to be amazing.

[10:10:41] <KillerWasp> MY BACKGROUND: languages:Spanish(100%)/English(20%), Employment:none, Education:none, Certificates:none, Patents:none, Publications:none, Honor Awards:none. Does anyone here believe that this can affect me as a freelancer?
[10:11:13] <arahael> KillerWasp: Totally.
[10:11:47] <nitrix> The only thing preventing me to enjoy rust is that a lot of the libraries I interact with are C-based, and the maintainers of those libraries always wrap them in safe higher-level interfaces that are going to take years to become as good as the base ones, if they even work properly.
[10:11:50] <KillerWasp> arahael: Regardless of my categories or talents?
[10:12:10] <nitrix> The day I'll get imgui and glfw to work with rust is the day I'll become a rust supporter, basically.
[10:12:45] <arahael> nitrix: I keep hearing more about imgui these days. It's interesting.
[10:12:47] <nitrix> I spent so much time trying to fix the sys crate and then the related crates.
[10:13:29] <KillerWasp> :(
[10:13:38] <ent58> I feel like Rust made a lot of good choices and some bad ones that murder it
[10:13:47] <arahael> KillerWasp: The better you understand english - and any other languge, and hte more employment, education, certificates, patents, publications, etcetera, eteter, that you have...  Obviously should positiviely affect you as a freelancer.  That includes past projects done as a freelancer.
[10:13:58] <arahael> ent58: What are those bad choises?
[10:14:24] <ent58> they are mostly QoL stuff, similar to what nitrix mentioned
[10:14:28] <arahael> nitrix: Honestly with Rust, I mostly use bindgen, and then use the newly exposed libraries pretty much as-is.
[10:14:40] <ent58> it's the fact that it's not _quite_ the efficiency of C at times
[10:14:50] <ent58> that seems like a minor nitpick
[10:15:10] <arahael> Eh, maybe.  I feel that C's efficiency is oversold these days.
[10:16:05] <nitrix> C has its own problems. Lots of scenarios where aliasing cannot be statically checked so the compiler has to be conservative.
[10:16:21] <ent58> hence, restrict :]
[10:16:22] <nitrix> `restrict` helps of course, but no one takes the time to annotate their functions.
[10:16:28] <ent58> I do!
[10:16:30] <ent58> haha
[10:17:09] <nitrix> Same. Heavy on const-correctness too, but I can't force people to and I use their libraries.

[10:18:09] <ent58> Templates make C++ very, very powerful to the point where some patterns are just plain better than C, a commonly brought up example is qsort
[10:18:17] <ent58> or any place where mixins are used
[10:18:25] <nitrix> Recently cglm forced me to cast to remove a lot of `const`. They have a "struct-based" API that's correct; albeit it relies strongly on the optimizer to avoid doing copies in/out of functions.
[10:20:04] <ent58> nitrix: this is one thing I struggle with. My instinct is to pass things around via address, and where it isn't guaranteed by the C++ standard (NRVO, RVO, Copy elision), I don't like relying on the optimizer in that way
[10:20:17] <ent58> but I find that a lot of high level interfaces absolutely need that pattern
[10:20:26] <arahael> I feel that C++ makes things that should be hard, too easy. And things that should be easy, too complex.
[10:20:29] <Decker> not unique_ptr? 
[10:20:35] <nitrix> C could've been a significantly better language if they didn't design the preprocessor with the current token-based handicap.

[11:49:07] <GeDaMo> comet23: no, not really
[11:49:28] <GeDaMo> The instructions are simpler so you need more of them to get anything done
[11:50:06] <GeDaMo> Also, you have to handle more details manually
[11:50:11] <ent58> I think it's easier in some concrete ways, more complex in others. There will certainly be no magic: no high level interfaces, just you, the instructions, the state of the program, and any abstractions the OS provides
[11:50:42] <comet23> so if i become really good at assembly i will be a high level programming demi-god?
[11:50:55] <Decker> no
[11:50:57] <comet23> =(
[11:51:25] <Decker> it'll make you criticized for over optimizing and making ugly code :)... because you know what it's actually doing at the assembly level
[11:52:14] <ent58> the abstract machine most languages define is a different beast and in something like C++, the compiler is allowed to do whatever it wants as long as the resulting program functions as the specification intends
[11:52:24] <Decker> or - you walk away from caring and then no other language really does anything the assembly way
[11:52:55] <comet23> i just want to be good at figuring out how to spot patterns and answers
[11:53:27] <comet23> like GeDaMo was able to deduce that all you need to do is subtract it and if it's greater than 9 it means that the distance is greater than 10 so it's good
[11:53:39] <ent58> there's a lot of compsci wrapped up in that, algorithms and data structures, understanding complexity
[11:53:45] <GeDaMo> I didn't deduce that, it's a common pattern in asm
[11:54:14] <Decker> it's like a flathead screwdriver really
[11:54:16] <GeDaMo> Note that you'll need the absolute value of the difference to compare
[11:54:21] <comet23> i'm a computer science major but i feel like i'm way less intelligent than everyone else around me so idk if i'm doing the right major lol
[11:54:26] <ent58> the major tool you have for making decisions at machine level is flag states, usually via a subtraction whose result is thrown away (cmp instruction)

[13:16:46] <BASHitup> That's saying a lot for a humanities major. 
[13:17:12] <comet23> what do you do with a philosophy major
[13:17:28] <BASHitup> Well, my plan was to create a business using nix products to exploit the new demand for Win 11 which will invariably change everyone's work flow. 
[13:17:45] <comet23> i get computer science is because that's how computers work and you become good with computers because that's like super important but what do you get out of knowing plato?
[13:17:45] <BASHitup> I had someone interested in my ideas but he wouldn't treat it like a job, I'm fickle enough as is so ... yeah

[13:18:35] <comet23> what does a philosophy degree do for you?
[13:18:44] <BASHitup> Anyone who wants to bullshit two-thirds of the time and one-third of the time talk about business and for one-third of the third actually act on the business ideas so that three-fifths of all the times profit can be ultimately made, let me know. 
[13:19:23] <comet23> i'm switching majors to philosphy
[13:19:27] <comet23> it seems like a good idea

[13:19:58] <comet23> like i never knew
[13:20:12] <BASHitup> K, so the philosophy degree thing is severely slanted. That was my undergraduate major. 
[13:20:27] <comet23> what if we're autistic and suffer from assholery?
[13:20:31] <BASHitup> So I am biased. But the stats are the stats and they are in my favor 
[13:20:44] <BASHitup> OK, if you're that, then you are in the right field. 
[13:20:57] <comet23> my psychologist told me i have asperger's but i'm dumb as rocks
[13:21:02] <BASHitup> Talking to people with social skills so subpar that they relate better to programming machines seems fitting 
[13:21:11] <BASHitup> *programmed machines 
[13:21:32] <BASHitup> I'm not a programmer but for some reason I get along with the people in this room more so than any other IRC channel. 
[13:22:33] <BASHitup> Ok, so as for philosophy jobs. That's a very broad thing. Most philosophy students have interests that go far beyond their degree path but all of them know how to think so they excel at what they eventually do. 
[13:22:38] <BASHitup> They know how to problem solve.

[15:26:51] <Raziel> Sqaure, in signals you can, because you usually take 0dB to mean "full output"

[15:36:42] <arahael> BASHitup: Not the audience, no.
[15:36:51] <BASHitup> For someone that's not into the security end of it, it matters little. 
[15:37:29] <BASHitup> If you go into the security channel, conversely, they're less interested in code. They use scripts for nmap scans and auditing but they don't spend full conversations talking about syntax or programming philosophy. 
[15:37:37] <BASHitup> So, yes, the audience and the venue -- all of that is key. 
[15:38:11] <nomagno> BASHitup: Really, it shouldn't even matter for someone that is into the security end of it. It's just superstition to require HTTPS for everything, that website literally isn't handling any information that requires encryption

[16:45:51] <Guest11> hey all... Not too sure it's the best channel to ask this but I'm wondering something about password managers security.
[16:45:53] <Guest11> If a device that has a password manager is owned and the user logs to a single site using the password managers, are all passwords (that is: for all the sites) compromised?
[16:46:23] <pyzozord> Intelo: I think you are focusing too much on the hammer and not enough on the nail

[17:16:44] <davros_> i am working on a game engine that runs in the web brwoser... same code will run natively or in a browser
[17:16:49] <Intelo> ya but I can't replace react with wasm
[17:16:53] <davros_> just compiled differently
[17:17:09] <davros_> you can make native UI's and run them in the browser with wasm
[17:17:22] <davros_> before wasm i didnt' look at browsers
[17:17:22] <Intelo> native?.. I mean "native"?
[17:17:23] *** AsenMx_ is now known as AsenMx
[17:17:33] <Intelo> what do you mean by native here?
[17:17:39] <Intelo> native desktop like?
[17:17:42] <Intelo> in browser?
[17:17:50] <davros_> native = programs compiled for the local processor, running on the desktop yes
[17:18:07] <Intelo> "local processor"?
[17:18:11] <davros_> "real programs" like people used to have before everyone decided to run everything on someone elses computer in "the cloud"
[17:18:25] <Intelo> like directly running ? but browser will still do the sandbox thing for security
[17:18:39] <Intelo> ok..
[17:18:40] <davros_> in an ideal world the OS would sandbox
[17:18:57] <Intelo> but for now browsers sandbox wasm I guess
[17:18:57] <davros_> and the browser would just be a way to share text 
[17:19:34] <davros_> the browser has been stretched to insane levels
[17:19:46] <Intelo> ok, what UI would be made in wasm? what would it look like? you know of any example? does it means i would replace reactjs with wasm derived native ui? boy it will surely be faster but don't know if it would be that easy and maintainable as reactjs
[17:19:56] <davros_> we just need OS's that can sandbox but until they can do that properly we'll can use wasm in the browser as a workaround
[17:20:22] <Intelo> davros_ yes, browsers have stretched to insane levels. I would like to repeat that after you...
[17:20:22] <davros_> WASM can drive webGL and webGPU ,so you can run any graphical interface that can be compled natively
[17:20:52] <Intelo> hm...
[17:22:13] <Intelo> davros_ I have no background on native UIs. I am assuming that a) there will be no html, css, javascript then.. no need even b) tell me what tools would make better UI than html, css (I mean development speed faster)
[17:22:20] <Intelo> the native ones I mea
[17:22:21] <Intelo> n
[17:22:24] <Intelo> mean*
[17:22:32] <davros_> i dont look at UI libraries much but they exist

[17:23:01] <davros_> there's something called ImGUI aswell used for complex debug UI
[17:23:33] <Intelo> Is there any UI that is better than HTML in terms of development speed and featureset?
[17:23:43] <davros_> raw graphics can do anything
[17:23:52] <Intelo> davros_ so there is no point in having htmlin page if wasm is used?
[17:24:00] <Intelo> raw graphics?
[17:24:05] <Intelo> don't know what that would be
[17:24:13] *** Joins: Inst (~Liam@c-98-208-218-119.hsd1.fl.comcast.net)
[17:24:22] <davros_> opengl lets you run pixel shaders on 3d triangle primitives, so you can build absolutely anything
[17:24:36] <davros_> a UI library decomposes itself into primtiives, textured triangles
[17:24:53] <Intelo> ok but my ui is simple, eg web forms, buttons, nav bar. menu its
[17:24:54] <Intelo> etc
[17:25:12] <davros_> if you want to do that sort of thing the standard web tools are probably ok
[17:25:30] <davros_> wasm is probably overkill
[17:25:38] <Intelo> so how to mix those standard UI tools like html and css with wasm for all other stuff and replace react?
[17:25:52] <davros_> thats probabyl overkill
[17:25:57] <davros_> if thats what you want to do 
[17:26:05] <davros_> there is no "one size fits all"
[17:26:20] <davros_> i personally care about native programs and wasm is just a way to emulate those in the browser
[17:26:37] <davros_> besides that i dont care about the web much, besides sharing text, images, video
[17:27:05] <Intelo> I see
[17:27:21] <davros_> the web IS good for presenting information but interacting with it at fine grain , native is nicer
[17:27:32] <Intelo> Ok, if you had to work on web only, what language would you use:
[17:27:36] <Intelo> heres my old question:
[17:27:39] <davros_> i'd   shoot myself
[17:27:40] <Intelo> I use typescript for react and node but now I am thinking that I am fedup due to the "noise" in code. I watched coffeescript, it was so concise. But I don't know if this is a good option. I think its not. Not so adapted/supported/will be there in future. Rust is liked by many and emerging nicely. Any chance I can use Rust for frontend and backend
[17:27:40] <Intelo> and AI. Python is on top too. I don't know the confusion. I just wish I could go with one langauge for front and back that is noiseless, strictly typed, can work on web. Few buzwords: wasm, dart, clojure, typescript, rust, python, AI, Any thoughts?
[17:27:49] <davros_> heh only kidding 
[17:28:05] <davros_> but basically I cannot advise you on what the best tools for the web are .. i dont know them
[17:28:11] <davros_> i have only looked into it casually
[17:28:30] <davros_> most programs dont need the control of rust
[17:28:32] <Intelo> I see. nice !
[17:28:40] <davros_> so that long list of alternatives has its virtues
[17:28:47] <davros_> wait for someone versed in them to answer
[17:29:06] <Intelo> davros_ so in 2022 there is absoultely no point in using c/c++ for anything and we should use rust only?
[17:29:20] <davros_> python is a nice utility language (i use it for little thigns) but strnog typed languages scale better for more complex server side applications
[17:29:35] <davros_> in 2022 C++ lives on because many important libraries are written in it
[17:29:38] <Intelo> python is slow though
[17:29:47] <davros_> for example, rust itself leans on C++ for its compiler back end, LLVM
[17:29:50] <Intelo> davros_ well, I mean for 'new' apps
[17:30:03] <Intelo> davros_ well, I mean the rust vs c question¬† ¬†for 'new' apps
[17:30:05] <davros_> so i would not declare C++ to be dead , it will live on I think
[17:30:18] <davros_> also most native programs use some major C++ library, like Unreal Engine
[17:30:45] <davros_> i am lucky able to afford a lot of time to write my own alternatives
[17:30:45] <edgar-rft> 'new' apps should be written entirely in JavaScript
[17:30:46] <Intelo> well, even ruby and php will live but my point is, "no need for c/c++ for new apps now"?
[17:30:54] <davros_> you're trolling edgar-rft , right
[17:31:23] <Intelo> edgar-rft seriously? js?
[17:31:28] <davros_> for practicality, most native tasks would still be done in C or C++, because they would lean on an existing library
[17:31:48] <davros_> like to make 3d games, Unreal engine is still the best choice
[17:32:00] <davros_> the linux kernel is still C
[17:32:04] <Intelo> davros_ am.. I though rust can do what those leaned libs in c/c++ do
[17:32:07] <davros_> C/C++ knowledge is important
[17:32:17] <davros_> Rust could do everything ,but it takes time to rewrite
[17:32:23] <Intelo> davros_ FYI, kernal is¬† or will go rust
[17:32:32] <davros_> its not econmical to rewrite everyhing
[17:32:37] <davros_> i dont even think rust is good for the kernel
[17:32:41] <f843d0> Nowadays keeping the paradigm C / C++ is kinda awkward
[17:32:55] <f843d0> C / C++ could be used at the time of C++98
[17:32:56] <davros_> Rusts sweetspot is game engines, kernel is lower level
[17:33:04] <Intelo> davros_ no not rewrite. my question is that if I am starting something, it should never be in c/c++ but in rust? correct? as rust can do all what c/c++ can? correct?
[17:33:15] <davros_> rust CAN do everything C/C++ can
[17:33:24] <Intelo> davros_ but linux kernal is / will be in rust¬† i heard
[17:33:27] <davros_> but you will have to check ,"is this problem already mostly solved by a big library i can build on"
[17:33:31] <f843d0> Nowadays, C and C++ have diverged at such level which make them literally two complete separate indipendent programming languages
[17:33:34] <davros_> Intelo fake news
[17:33:50] <davros_> i still say C/C++ to emphasise there is also a common subset
[17:34:07] <davros_> and yes you're right C has extentions beyond that
[17:34:26] <davros_> but it is still possible to stick to a subset where you can flip '.c' '.cpp'
[17:34:27] <f843d0> davros_: you mean C++
[17:34:27] <Intelo> ok
[17:34:35] <pulse> C is trivial compared to C++
[17:34:37] <davros_> i say C/C++ when i mean C/C++ :)
[17:34:39] <Intelo> there is yew in rust but not mature yet
[17:34:53] <f843d0> davros_: luckily C is kept basically the same since decades
[17:34:55] <Intelo> davros_ ok nice talking
[17:35:16] <davros_> there's a few additions in recent C i think that diverge from the C i used in 1995-1999
[17:35:32] <f843d0> davros_: you're talking of C11 versus C99 versus C89
[17:35:43] <f843d0> davros_: but do we really need to list the C++ variants?
[17:35:44] <davros_> yeah, i've not touched any variant since
[17:36:00] <f843d0> davros_: C++98 C++03 C++11 C++14 C++17 C++20...
[17:36:01] <davros_> i've used c++ up until c++17 or something
[17:36:15] <Intelo> Question to all : is there any.. ANY UI lib/strategy/language/framework that is simply better and fast to develop as compared to html,css , js websites. I am thinking to use native UI in wasm instead of react/ js. It will still be a website.
[17:36:19] <davros_> when i look at C++20 concepts , thats when the time i've sunk into leanring rust seems to pay off :)
[17:36:28] <pulse> C delivers the simplest possible featureset to enable all the power you would ever need. that's its main appeal. C++ is an enormous beast in comparison
[17:36:54] <f843d0> pulse: +1
[17:36:55] <davros_> Intelo if you want to make traditional web UIs., i think traditional web tools are fine, but you'll need to ask someone who uses them for real opinions
[17:36:55] <pulse> Intelo, no, JS offers the most freedom and by far the best RAD capabilities. but it comes with a cost
[17:37:07] <davros_> what did pulse say , i'm curious. he has me blocked
[17:37:22] <pulse> i don't have you blocked, you have me blocked lmao
[17:38:13] <pulse> Intelo, in any case, Electron should fit most modern needs. i still prefer traditional apps though, so i'm doing some stuff with wxWidgets
[17:38:18] <davros_> Intelo web tools tend to focus on rapid development  , at the expense of runtime efficiency. Rust , C++ etc.. tend to take longer to develop, but run more efficientrly. both have valid reasons to exist
[17:38:26] <f843d0> Intelo: if your goal is still to manage a webpage, it's much easier to stick with "Standard Frameworks there"
[17:38:37] <rtypo> he says you actually blocked him :P
[17:38:42] <davros_> hah ok
[17:38:49] <davros_> i forgot
[17:39:00] <davros_> he has some crazy views so i had to 
[17:39:16] <davros_> he thinks the universe is serial  instead of parallel, i can't cope with that level of delusion
[17:39:34] <pyzozord> Intelo: there is no absolutes
[17:39:47] <pyzozord> different people will have different opinions
[17:40:06] <pyzozord> this is a bad question to ask, unless what you want is subjective opinions
[17:40:16] <anomal> howtomost effciintly encode bool and

[17:40:19] <anomal> or
[17:40:27] <pulse> davros_, the universe is both serial and parallel

[18:40:19] <DPA> Custom elements are a bit like react, just without the state. You register a custom element name, and when it appears anywhere, a class you define gets instantiated. You also get mount / unmount callbacks. And shadow dom allows overlaying some DOM tree over any element. Feedback can be done by registering event listeners. I also sometimes use custom events for some stuff.

[18:41:12] <ballrog> Hello, I asked this in freenode IRC and they told me to instead ask here. I am working on a JavaScript assignment. My code is here: https://bpa.st/5OYQ I am getting image input from the user and one of the functions that the code should perform is recording the height and width (in pixels) of the input image. The image upload is working correctly.
[18:41:12] <ballrog> I initialize variables for the height and width on lines 141-142, then assign them to what should be the image's height and width on lines 150-151. These values are added to the output text file on lines 205-206. The problem is that the values for the height and width that end up in the text file are incorrect. I tried it with a 661px/660px image
[18:41:13] <ballrog> and the height was displayed as 0 and the width was displayed as 755. I checked whether 755 was 660sqrt(2) but it's not, so it's not recording the diagonal or anything like that. I'm not sure what the problem is. Any help is appreciated - thanks!

[18:50:33] <Decker> that's loaded from chainreact.html https://d3x0r.github.io/ChainReaction/  (demo) uses that popup stuff too
[18:50:51] <Decker> also is a test of tensorflow... tought it how to play on the 8 by 5 board
[18:50:54] <Decker> taught
[18:51:22] <Intelo> DPA Decker so... you guys never used react , vue or angular?
[18:51:23] <ballrog> OK I checked it again and I'm still getting 0 for the height. I think the problem is in lines 142-152 but I don't see it
[18:51:35] <ballrog> https://jsfiddle.net/x02tspuj/
[18:51:56] <Decker> Intelo no; so saying it's easier/easy as is oemthing i'm avoiding... I expect it's not ... I mean they invented the frameworks for some reason - probably not to complicate things :)
[18:51:57] <ballrog> ^ so that yall can test it, I'm getting a height of 0 in the output text file
[18:52:06] <Decker> omething=something
[18:52:12] <ballrog> Even when I click the output text file after waiting for a bit
[18:52:18] <DPA> (With "new stuff", I don't mean frameworks, I mean the native browser APIs).
[18:52:18] <DPA> I did use react, vue and angular once. Or, well, angular 1. So no, I never used the modern versions. Although I may revisit vue some day.
[18:54:16] <Intelo> Decker DPA so as Decker said that react guys/fw guys must have done something to facilitate and not complicate. I wonder why and when to use those and why and when not to use those.¬† ¬†Is it just me who things that they might be just marketing buzzwords like "mongo" is. In fact, postgres is enought and no mysql/mongo ever was needed.

[18:55:35] <Decker> ballrog you have to wait for onload for the image element... otherwise the size isn't set
[18:55:56] <ballrog> how come the width is appearing as nonzero?
[18:56:04] <ballrog> but the height is still 0?
[18:56:12] <Decker> it atakes time to do the request and update the image from image.src
[18:56:35] <Decker> probably from the default styling of the element
[18:56:54] <Decker> it's 197 in my window - but it's all squished

[18:58:26] <ballrog> yeah that's what I mean, the width shows correctly but height is still 0
[18:58:36] <ballrog> like it shows 197 for width for you, but still says 0 for height
[18:58:36] <Decker> Intelo Mongo works with unstructured data... stuff that's from user inputs, and glom(smoosh?) things together even if they don't fit an exact SQL table schema
[18:58:46] <Decker> i's not correct... it's 512x512
[18:59:00] <ballrog> I think it's showing the width after being resized
[18:59:06] <Decker> it's probabl the width of the filename...

[18:59:32] <ballrog> .width doesn't give image width?
[18:59:55] <Decker> width:40%
[19:00:01] <Intelo> Decker mostly, unstructured data is never needed. some where, somehow, it needs structure unless its adocument
[19:00:04] <ballrog> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5633264/javascript-get-image-dimensions
[19:00:10] <Decker> ballrog it does once it's loaded
[19:00:25] <Decker> you have to igve it time to request the file and update the control
[19:00:34] <ballrog> if it's not loaded then why would the width show up but not the height
[19:00:41] <Decker> 'request the file' from the browsers viewpoint
[19:00:42] <ballrog> if it's not loaded, neither should show up
[19:00:50] <Decker> seems like a bug to me
[19:01:08] <ballrog> yes I am missing something
[19:01:13] <ballrog> just not sure where I messed up
[19:02:02] <DPA> Frameworks do take away some design decisions. The 3 good things frameworks actually do is: 1) templating 2) inversion of control like data binding mechanisms where sensible 3) helping to structure projects modularly using conventions or sometimes even enforcing a structure.
[19:02:02] <DPA> This can make it easier to get started, and makes it less likely to mix up all kinds of concepts for those things, which could lead to a mess otherwise.

[19:07:50] <DPA> Intelo: If you don't have guidelines to follow, just use whatever suits you most. Although, if it's an assignment, you may want to look into the fundamentals of UI stuff. Design patterns such as MVVM, MVC, check how frameworks do it, how it can be natively done, and compare what seams most helpful for your usecase.

[21:32:38] <bjs> ProfSimm: no good reason,  it's a leftover of the very old languages (presumably Simula or Pascal,  maybe even earlier).  Those very old languages tended to be syntax heavy and a lot of our modern programming language syntax can be traced back to them.

[21:39:42] <Intelo> now.
[21:39:44] <bjs> ProfSimm: you could have a language where the expression "x y" meant something like "access attribute 'y' of the object got from evaluating x" and that'd be fine.  I mean Haskell-y languages use whitespace for function application

[23:17:42] <ProfSimm> I'd probably die for my leader Daniel Patrick Abrecht. Especially if he wears a tight uniform.
[23:19:16] <ProfSimm> In fact, now that I know your name, I regret arguing about bits vs integers, as I'm clearly clueless.
[23:19:42] <gambl0re> can i change column type of TEXT to json?
[23:19:49] <gambl0re> or do i have to delete the column and create a new one?

[23:20:23] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: to be on the safe side, add a TEXT column, copy content to it from JSON column and when everything it OK, you can delete the old one

[23:21:01] <ProfSimm> DPA: I bind my life to the cause
[23:21:03] <gambl0re> ProfSimm: ok. there is a json and jsonb column type. which should i use?
[23:21:15] <Hash> json is longtext, json blob is binary i think
[23:21:20] <Hash> binary provides json parsing 
[23:21:21] <Hash> IIRC
[23:21:25] <DPA> Yes. Souls. More! More!
[23:21:27] <Hash> Check the docs links I pasted
[23:21:40] <Hash> Read both. You didn't yet have enough time to read both pages.
[23:21:59] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: which DB is that. MySQL only has JSON which is stored as jsonb
[23:22:07] <CodePoint> I fucked up my database, so I had to purge it and reinstall it, and now apache doesn't like me.  I'll probably have to re-install the whole server now.

[23:22:21] <CodePoint> Maria
[23:22:32] <ProfSimm> gambl0re: read the docs and choose, but jsonb is better in general
[23:22:38] <gambl0re> ok thanks

[23:26:06] <gambl0re> how can i add a new column as not null but then when i add the new column, the column will be empty so I cant create it
[23:26:14] <CodePoint> Just enter this into mysql: DROP DATABASE *;
[23:26:19] <gambl0re> do i add the not null constraint after the column has been created?
