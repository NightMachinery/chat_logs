[11:47:03] <ERROH> yesterday i learned that perseverance doesn't seem to have a battery limiter and they have figure out proper loads all the time so batteries don't overcharge
[11:47:33] <ERROH> and it is not so simple, heaters can take only this much power
[11:49:07] <jotham> wonder if that was regarded as lower risk than the risk of some over excited particles shutting down the battery by mistake

[11:59:51] <ERROH> yeah, i was thinking the same
[12:00:15] <ERROH> jwst has like 140 spof's during deployment
[12:01:26] <ERROH> so fuck launch, it will take 30 days if we launched the most expensive piece of garbage ever
[12:01:27] <jotham> i see your neighbours are using nuclear bombers to patrol the manufactured migrant crisis
[12:01:55] <ERROH> i disregard any news regarding that thing
[12:02:02] <jotham> fair enough
[12:02:06] <jotham> it's a very long way away from me
[12:03:08] <jotham> was good seeing venus in the middle of the day this week

[12:25:02] <byku> just wondering, is there no activity on this channel?
[12:25:09] <jotham> none
[12:25:13] <Renderwww> never has been
[12:25:17] <Faux> Absolutely dead.
[12:25:32] <Faux> We barely even get raj anymore.
[12:25:48] <jotham> deep tissue rajjage
[12:25:52] <Faux> Juliu is getting there; but I'd say its skill is less than 1% of a raj.
[12:25:58] <jotham> yep
[12:26:18] <jotham> juliu is like the cheap version of raj management put in to cut costs
[12:26:21] <Faux> 10 milliraj if you will.
[12:26:37] <Renderwww> didn't one of those make you rage quit recently Faux?
[12:27:24] <byku> let us make this channel active then :)
[12:27:32] <jotham> is byku the new management
[12:27:41] <Faux> Yeah, it was Juliu; I was trying to treat them like a regular person and they betrayed me.
[12:27:57] <byku> nope, I am a newbie :)
[12:28:28] <byku> btw, is anyone interested in working on some side-project with me?
[12:28:31] <Faux> I'm actually having a great time at the moment personally; I'm trying to move house and my solicitor closed down due to a cybering incident and we have no idea what the fuck is going on. \o/
[12:28:38] <Faux> Normies using computers, not even once.
[12:29:22] <jotham> wow i didn't know it was cause of cyber thrombosis
[12:29:47] <Faux> byku: You'll probably never find someone who takes up an offer like that. Many people, including me, work on side projects, and are happy for people to join; if they are motivated by the same thing as me? Unlikely, though!
[12:30:23] <jotham> aussie had rife phishing based mitm attacks on agents, customers, escrow services for realestate transactions for most of 2k10 so they created a national housing clearing house type thing to manage it
[12:30:37] <Faux> I posted a similar update in a work channel with americans and one of the managers messaged me "Uh... I don't think 'cybering' means the same thing in US and UK english?" and I replied "Really? In UK english it's where two or more people put on balaclavas and have fun using computers.".
[12:30:42] <Faux> I love laughing at my own jokes.
[12:31:01] <jotham> haha
[12:31:30] <byku> Faux: why not, working on side-project with friends is more fun that working alone. 
[12:31:32] <Faux> "That could still go multiple ways..." "Many people go multiple ways; and that's okay."
[12:32:09] <Faux> byku: Maybe for you; normally when I'm working on a side project it's because I want to do something my way and get it right for once; unlike what we do at work where we try and collaborate to do it my way but with more arguments.
[12:33:27] <Renderwww> "get it right for once", yeah, as if this ever happens. I bet a months later you realize you fucked up again
[12:34:37] <jotham> pretty cynical for someone that almost won ww2
[12:34:59] <jotham> the aurora captured last week in dunedin (NZ) on an iphone https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FD-yuskUUAIiF9a?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
[12:35:11] <jotham> it was raining all week here so i didn't get a chance to see it :<<
[12:35:31] <Faux> I spent three+ hours last night refactoring some code with the intention of fixing the performance then realised it wasn't even the slow bit; I'd measured byt then forgotten the measurements before I got around to fixing it.
[12:39:43] <Renderwww> I wisend up and to prevent such problem ever occurring again I'll just spend all my time playing video games
[12:40:16] <jotham> the customer i've spent hte most amount of intellectual labor on in the last 2 years is leaving us for >adobe cloud<
[12:40:22] <jotham> i have mixed feelings about it
[12:40:26] <jotham> i learned a lot
[12:40:51] <jotham> it took 5 years for one of our major newspapers to successfully move to adobe cloud
[12:41:02] <jotham> so i assume in 6 months when they start they wont really be gone for a while
[12:41:06] <Faux> I thought Adobe Cloud was just their name for "you're paying a subscription for photoshop now"?
[12:41:14] <Renderwww> is adobe cloud the IBM of creative people?
[12:41:45] <jotham> naah they have a web cloud thing now with saas and devops on tap to consume media and ecommerce related web properties
[12:41:52] <Renderwww> >2021 almost over, still using photoshop instead of gimp
[12:41:56] <Renderwww> those people!
[12:42:03] <jotham> i think so Renderwww 
[12:46:47] <Faux> Photoshop alone is £250/yr here. That's double what I pay for the entire intellij suite, which is less subscription only.
[12:47:37] <Renderwww> but can you paint pictures with intjelyyj?

[13:19:48] <Carbonflux> i have a creative cloud sub, its not so bad really, i get annoyed with it sometimes but never enough to cancel.
[13:20:25] <Carbonflux> i have the photo sub, so i get light room as well
[13:20:45] <Carbonflux> i don't use their storage tho
[13:21:34] <Carbonflux> also there is the once you get used to something thing
[13:21:59] <Carbonflux> it always takes me some time to "relearn" gimp when i try to use it
[13:22:35] <Carbonflux> also they make it hard to cancel
[13:22:43] <Carbonflux> you have to agree to a year
[13:22:54] <Carbonflux> and it automatically reups 
[13:23:15] <Carbonflux> so if you don't catch it at just the right time it miss being able to cancel it
[13:23:53] <Carbonflux> also their apps have all most a malware level foot print.
[13:24:40] <Carbonflux> they invade everything, it takes some effort to uninstall all of it, much more than an average use could do.
[13:26:02] <Carbonflux> skyrim 10th anniversary addition is out on steam.
[13:26:28] <Carbonflux> i am curious about the survival mode
[13:31:50] <jotham> yeah how many copies of skyrim do we need to buy though
[13:32:00] <jotham> i own like 6 copies of company of heroes
[13:32:10] <Carbonflux> heh
[13:32:18] <jotham> i'd like to do a replay of skyrim but would like a HD redo of it
[13:32:24] <Carbonflux> well, its an upgrade for the special addition
[13:32:35] <jotham> so probably my third copy of skyrim
[13:32:38] <jotham> eh
[13:33:13] <Carbonflux> so if you have SR:SE you get some of it for free and its 20 bucks for the whole thing.
[13:33:35] <T`aZ> ive installed a racing game: i cant finish a single lap without destroying the car completely
[13:33:44] <T`aZ> s/: /: GRID/
[13:33:44] <Carbonflux> its adds all the DLC and all the creative club mods for the last 10 years
[13:34:05] <Carbonflux> ya, codemaster games are hard
[13:34:16] <Carbonflux> there are like a billion settings in it
[13:34:38] <Carbonflux> i find grid hard to play with a kb as well
[13:34:44] <T`aZ> im still playing it like need for speed or trackmania, it does NOT go well
[13:34:50] <jotham> that sounds cool Carbonflux 
[13:34:58] <Carbonflux> ya, its a simulator
[13:35:11] <jotham> you should totally learn the muscle memory for an xbox controller if you haven't
[13:35:12] <Carbonflux> ya jotham, it adds fishing 
[13:35:20] <T`aZ> Carbonflux: im using a joypad with xbox360 controller emulater, but it still sucks :/
[13:35:21] <jotham> it's dumb pc/mac gamers don't
[13:35:33] <jotham> xbox controller was great for red dead 2
[13:36:49] <T`aZ> im tempted to by second hand pedals and wheels, but, no clue if its worth it
[13:37:22] <T`aZ> the acceleration is all or nothing in that game, with the xbox controller, it doesnt make sense :/

[14:42:09] <Faux> nope.js
[14:42:45] <jotham> dukwon over promise and under deliver isn't a rule for life, it's a given
[14:42:51] <dukwon> we had a summer student start writing a web app for us since we don't know how to javascript
[14:43:23] <dukwon> unfortunately we hadn't done all of the ground work yet, providing the metadata it has to read in
[14:43:35] <dukwon> so there's a lot of hard-coded nonsense
[14:43:43] <dukwon> and the data is treated as code
[14:44:18] <dukwon> first problem once i provided the full set of metadata: it crashes while building due to OOM
[14:44:57] <dukwon> also the git repo is like 600 MB because the summer student (and the PhD student who took over) committed the data to the repo
[14:45:14] <dukwon> there's only about 4 MB of actual code
[14:45:43] <Faux> Ew.
[14:46:00] <dukwon> anyway so now i'm learning asynchronous i/o and shit, trying to make it work sensibly
[14:46:25] <Faux> Work's megalith is still somehow still under half a gig of .git, despite having 300 committers; apparently none of them have managed to do anything insane enough.
[14:47:05] <Faux> dukwon: Be careful not to learn anything legacy; a lot of the problems have been fixed in the last few years (for most usecases where you don't need to go low level) and a lot of docs/blogs/SO will tell you to do it the hard way.
[14:47:28] <jotham> '4MB of actual code'
[14:47:36] <jotham> you mean like at best 10-100k
[14:47:41] <jotham> and then kitchen sinks for africa
[14:47:49] <dukwon> possibly
[14:48:20] <dukwon> ah right, 144k in the src/ folder
