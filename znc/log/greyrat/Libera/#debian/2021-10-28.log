[01:50:28] <HelloShitty> the unit file is rather located somewhere at /lib/systemd/system instead of the usua /etc/systemd/system/
[01:50:39] <HelloShitty> s/usua/usual
[01:51:27] <kveroneau> HelloShitty, that is where system installed unit files go.  As for the service failing to start, it could an error with the nginx config.  You should do a "systemctl status nginx" to see why it failed.
[01:51:53] <HelloShitty> kveroneau: status doesn't give many clues
[01:52:22] <HelloShitty> however, if I use nginx like `nginx -t` I get only 2 warnings about self-signed certificates and all the rest is fine

[01:55:20] <HelloShitty> I have made some changes to the file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default but it shouldn't be related to the unit file
[01:55:23] <HelloShitty> I guess
[01:55:37] <HelloShitty> How can I stop nginx?
[01:56:01] <HelloShitty> Like, I tried a few commands like `sudo nginx stop`, `sudo nginx quit`
[01:56:13] <HelloShitty> but nor stop nor quit seems to be known options
[01:56:29] <kveroneau> HelloShitty, you should use "systemctl stop nginx" so that systemd can clean up the PIDs it might be tracking.
[01:56:30] <HelloShitty> `sudo systemctl stop nginx` says service not loaded
[01:56:52] <HelloShitty> wait
[01:57:00] <kveroneau> If you run "ps aux|grep nginx" nothing is being displayed for it, correct?
[01:57:06] <HelloShitty> `systemctl stop nginx` returns no errors, but nginx is still running
[01:57:28] <HelloShitty> it is, like if I never ran `systemctl stop nginx`
[01:57:29] <herald>  sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop ?

[02:01:42] <kveroneau> Going through /etc/init.d/ is considered legacy, or the Devian way.  It's the old SysV method before systemd came along to replace it as the init system.  That directory and those scripts exist for legacy reasons.

[02:01:55] *** Joins: s0mbra (jd@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/s0mbra)
[02:02:32] <somiaj> Debian also does allow maintainers to support other init systems, so many do provide it for those who don't want to use systemd, but it isn't required to also include sysv init files (or any other init system scripts)
[02:02:35] <HelloShitty> Now, either nginx is magically autorestarting when I kill it, or I have no idea why I can't kill/terminate the service
[02:03:09] <somiaj> HelloShitty: give it a second, and now test if those ngnix process are still running
[02:03:24] <kveroneau> sudo nginx -s quit

[03:01:31] <ahnaha> if I'm not using Cups and OpenVPN maybe I should stop the service or just uninstall it for security?
[03:02:45] <sney> if you ever save something as a pdf, even without a printer, you may be using cups
[03:02:45] *** Joins: lunc (~omnd@user/lunc)
[03:02:56] <sney> if openvpn is installed but not configured, it isn't doing anything anyway.
[03:03:11] <sney> but sure, you can always remove stuff that you don't need, and install it later if you change your mind
[03:04:20] <ahnaha> ah, yeah sometimes I do print to file
[03:05:06] <sney> I'm pretty sure cups only listens on localhost by default anyway
[03:06:18] <ahnaha> haveged procps I guess standard ?
[03:07:36] <sney> are you asking if they're always installed? that depends, you can find out by looking at 'apt show' and 'apt rdepends' output for a given package
[03:08:24] <sney> rdepends works best with the --installed option, e.g. 'apt rdepends --installed procps' will show you the installed packages that depend on procps

[03:18:49] <fred> btw: ended up on upgrading bullyeye to bookworm, since i wasnt able to fix my initial prob - but thx for helping
[03:20:17] <sney> fred: careful, bookworm is a moving target and the big transitions haven't even started yet. you'll probably want to subscribe to debian-devel-announce and idle in #debian-next on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera) at least
[03:20:27] <sney> (in case this wasn't already said)
[03:20:28] <fred> its ok sney
[03:21:05] <fred> bookworm is 'teting', which was ok for that machines role
[03:21:42] <fred> eheh 'unstable'
[03:22:01] <sney> sure, lots of people use testing, and are in that irc channel and subscribed to that email list, so that we can be warned about problems before experiencing them ourselves :)
[03:22:02] <fred> eheheh 'testing'
[03:22:14] <sney> bookworm has been very calm so far, I wonder when the other shoe will drop
[03:22:54] <fred> been using deb for so many years now and never had a prob like i wrote here before
[03:23:43] <sney> it's always the people who have been using it for "many years" who think they don't need to be proactive. ok, you were warned, see you next time lol :D
[03:23:48] <fred> but my excuse to myself is/was: it wasnt my system - o just need to keep it running

[07:49:35] <CarlFK> the kernel params are on the server, so I can give someone sudo to the pi and they can't update the server.
[07:50:00] <PMT> And what stops them from changing how the Pi boots and rebooting?

[07:50:39] <CarlFK> nothing - the server is ro
[07:50:47] <CarlFK> there is no sd card on the pi

[07:52:02] <CarlFK> let them kexec.  they can do whatever they want with the pi
[07:54:50] <CarlFK> netboot - which is behind tftp/nfs, and as long as I remember the ro in /etc/exports (which is on the server, not the pi) they can't change any of that

[19:42:20] <PMT> There are a number of single-letter nicks around. Some are even used.
[19:43:28] <jim> herald, do you want to have a typing tutor?
[19:44:25] <herald> "Hello, my name is "Bob-customer", I do not know my email, credit card i opened account with, the last time i logged in, how old my account is, my previous password or any of the older passwords, the last four of my social or the zip code attached to  any of the three credit cards you have listed on file, but i am a valued customer, give me access to my account!"

[19:46:37] <jim> I dunno, I thought you might... anyway, if so, here's a typing tutor with a bunch of different courses, to get it you could apt install gtypist
[19:47:55] <herald> is that really at thing though? i thought from what i read the new thing unlike freenode used to be was to realize folks were some working, some on mobile device, and some are non native english speakers and to have tolerance for such things as simple gramatical errors
[19:48:10] <herald> curioser and curioser
[19:48:57] <herald> one might remark that such things turn off new users from a particular distro as they get discouraged

[20:06:00] <herald> with my obvious typing shortcomings and carpal-tunnel, i run into many criticisms, i am usually working/messing around during slow time with some crazy thing like this clunker laptop, drinking cofee and maybe some other thing as such lurking more than normal non ontopic chatter is at a minumum for me
