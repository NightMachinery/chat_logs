[02:12:15] <two2thehead> huh "Gemini is an application-layer internet communication protocol for accessing remote documents, similarly to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Gopher. It is intended as a third alternative to those protocols. It comes with a special document format, commonly called "gemtext", that allows linking to other documents. Started by someone known as Solderpunk, the protocol is now being finalized collaboratively and has currently not been submitted 
[02:12:15] <two2thehead> to the IETF for standardization. "
[02:13:16] <pompolic> fair enough, although i've seen that page
[02:13:47] <two2thehead> "At its core, Gemini provides a simple, text-based way to present information for others on the internet. It is positioned in between Gopher, from before the advent of the web, and the HTTP and HTML of the web that fairly quickly supplanted Gopher for most people. Gemini "explores the space inbetween gopher and the web, striving to address (perceived) limitations of one while avoiding the (undeniable) pitfalls of the other". The intent is that 
[02:13:47] <two2thehead> Gemini will coexist with the other two; Gopher has seen something of a resurgence of late, while the web just keeps growing, of course."

[04:50:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, continuing to read that Leverage post by "Cathleen"...
[04:50:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am struck by how strong an undercurrent of female intrasexual competition there is in this account
[04:50:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's clearly a huge presence in her reactions, her very worldview
[04:51:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course never acknowledged explicitly, though she comes close)
[04:51:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Two specific points:
[04:52:52] <Filipepe> Obormot\Arcturus: link?
[04:53:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. *Of course* attractive young women take the opportunity presented by "let's discard standard norms of workplace professionalism" to use sex appeal to advance their status in the shared environment - this is possibly the least surprising thing in the entire story so far
[04:53:50] <PapuaHardyNet> are we talking about Leverage?... oh yeah obormot is talking about leverage
[04:54:25] <PapuaHardyNet> at this point, I need to reread that post just to ensure I have the context
[04:54:26] <gwern> it also applies to MAPLE
[04:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Also unsurprising but at the same time sad and vicariously bitter: the author clearly has some serious hangups about her own attractiveness and ability to derive status from "feminininity", performance of feminine gender roles, sexuality, etc. (i.e. she's a relative loser in the aforesaid competitions), and yet (but really I mean "and so obviously") she turns out to be the single most competent and get-it-done person in the
[04:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus>  place - because the latter quality is the only reason she gets in, in the first place; obvious selection effects...
[04:56:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's the name for this statistical effect? Competence and attractiveness end up uncorrelated because you get in by scoring high on one OR the other

[04:57:36] <gwern> it just mysteriously happened, probably because MAPLE doesn't have enough paperwork or experienced monks
[04:57:45] <PapuaHardyNet> (I imagine gwern as an old man when he says things like "ahem, nubile young women" and gently stroking his long xianxia beard)
[04:58:19] <pompolic> you know this to be true because the Gwern logo is in cathedral black
[04:59:14] <gwern> I regard 'nubile young women' as one of those deflating terms of people whose self-esteem may be a trifle too high. akin to Bay Aryans, if they were hot

[05:10:45] <kuudes> I sure hope here we repeat south african experience of nonobservable amount of deaths
[05:10:57] <kuudes> it seems our case reporting lags at least 7 days, maybe 14
[05:11:30] <kuudes> just noticed that helsinki today reported having had as much cases in last 14 days as has been recorded for the same duration for the whole country
[05:11:42] <kuudes> and clearly there have been cases outside helsinki as well
[05:12:23] <pompolic> i suggest ONE policy change, globally, forever
[05:12:25] <kuudes> so it seems we may indeed be on the exponential that was predicted some weeks ago but which has so far went unobserved, and we have currently cases something like 2x to 100x to what we observe currently
[05:12:35] <pompolic> any decisionmaking body must be named "loot council"
[05:12:47] <kuudes> and therefore in 2 weeks we will have mystery amount of people seeking hospital treatment for covid
[05:13:06] <kuudes> which I hope replicates the south african experience that there is about no people in hospital, as they say.
[05:13:12] <kuudes> that would be pretty nice.

[05:14:01] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm sure that this has a huge selection effect on who joins what company

[05:39:04] <gwern> what good does the isolating do? everyone still at the hospital is going to be exposed anyway and either has, or will have, it
[05:39:14] <kuudes> so the amount of people who can be treated in hospital in any case is miniscule compared to demand
[05:39:17] <gwern> my point is that the reaction seems to be causing the 'overflow'
[05:39:33] <kuudes> well, at certain narrow band, yes

[05:45:27] <kuudes> I am not sure why a lot of places seem to predict only 2x overrun of hospital capacity. perhaps it is indeed for avoiding to think of reality
[05:46:07] <kuudes> remember for usa there is the scenario for about 900k persons to die... before march?
[05:46:45] <kuudes> I really hope south africans are correct and I am alarmist panicing :)
[05:47:58] <kuudes> in sweden aomething of 15000 persons died in 2020 to covid. if they had went finnish way they would have got 2000 deaths maybe
[05:48:41] <kuudes> this is a major driver why I am sort of for unbased optimism
[05:48:59] <kuudes> though morphine is cheap and saves in future pension bills
[05:50:04] <kuudes> but yeah, I agree partly with you gwern, that indeed isolation demands may bring more harm than good. but they also still may bring more good than harm, and it is hard to know because of the fog of war
[05:50:10] <kuudes> so it becomes to precommitments and priors
[05:51:08] <pompolic> don't we have around 2 years of data at this point
[05:51:18] <pompolic> if only someone (not) me went and Looked
[05:51:22] <kuudes> sweden acted rationally and followed a plan, same sort of plan was apparently agreed also in finland. but the pesky politicians in finland got 1 week more thinking time and people paniced and self isolated and shut into their homes and politicians then populistically pandered to the public instead of the experts and ordered random lockdown measures
[05:51:25] <pompolic> (not me)*
[05:51:32] <kuudes> we have
[05:51:35] <kuudes> but not for omicron
[05:51:40] <pompolic> fair point
[05:51:47] <kuudes> for delta indeed same stuff as always works
[05:52:02] <kuudes> for omicron it is the open question indeed on if the same stuff is enough or not
[05:52:05] <pompolic> it's also interesting that the public was demanding lockdowns, not experts. updated
[05:52:15] <kuudes> then you can either precommit to try the same stuff or to give up and mitigate
[05:52:58] <kuudes> sweden's top epidemiologist is on public record pleading to finnish and uk colleguaes to not allow lockdown measures
[05:53:28] <kuudes> emails in multiple newspapers through local FOIA-like requests
[05:53:53] <pompolic> yeah i think Marc Van Raanst (belgian Covid-speakerperson) was also opposing lockdowns this time

[05:56:10] <kuudes> the presumption in 2020 spring was that there was 2 options: A) no lockdowns etc, pandemic kills those who it kills fast and society mourns and moves on within some months; B) lockdowns, braking measures, the pandemic kills those who it kills slow, society takes many months or years in pandemic and survivors suffer a lot of ptsd
[05:56:17] <kuudes> but it was surprisingly slow
[05:56:54] <kuudes> so actually A turned to B and B turned to C) local spread is suffocated and goes away, prevalence is manageable by local and voluntary measures
[05:57:21] <kuudes> but indeed you could not know that at the time you had to choose what action to precommit
[05:57:36] <kuudes> and now we are again in the same situation, where it seems options are A and B
[05:58:01] <kuudes> and preference order clearly is C > A > B
[05:58:57] *** Quits: schmudde (~schmudde@216.169.6.249) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:59:53] <kuudes> and again over here in finland, the health experts seem to be mostly pushing for infecting people to get rid of mortality debt to covid, and general population is somewhat shaky between wanting more vaccines and lockdowns and wanting to live with the virus
[06:01:06] <kuudes> current pros to A are that disease has been allowed to spread in children during the fall in many places, because children rarely get hospitalized; and for C that there is currently christmas break and it seems per google data that people are actually still quite well tending to stay at homes and avoiding bars and people
[06:01:44] <kuudes> also for A many parts of country have sort of pushed their testing to as low as they dare etc
[06:02:10] <kuudes> so, forces to both direction, I guess it will be omicron who chooses what happens now :-/
[06:02:22] <kuudes> maybe we get a long B now...
[06:03:15] <kuudes> but yeah, I should head to sleep

[10:04:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still lacking a mixer, I just used my cordless power drill (with dough hook inserted) to mix up some bread dough
[10:06:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Worked surprisingly well. Mixed by hand (spatula) until flour was mostly integrated, switched to drill on low speed (high torque) to fully incorporate / homogenize, then high speed until desired texture (in either case, clutch set to the "drill" setting).
[10:07:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> The auto-on LED work light mounted above the trigger came in handy too, as it turned out.
[10:08:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Kind of a strain on the hand, though. Thinking of some way to jury-ring a clamp setup for the mixing bowl so I can hold the drill with both hands.
[10:09:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the whole, though, a viable solution. And has the virtue of it being much, much less likely for the motor to fail due to excessive strain... the drill's motor is built for a lot more torque than a hand mixer's...
