[00:51:13] <LjL> Matt|home, a verb is whatever behaves in a certain way in the language's grammar. it may often refer to an action, but saying it is *always* an action is not going to end up with a workable definition in any indo-european language
[00:51:45] <LjL> also, "have" is often also considered a verb in that sentence, but a "helper verb" or "auxiliary verb", in that it changes the tense of the main verb
[00:52:21] <LjL> "have" can also be used as a stand-alone verb, and i guess it's often neither an action nor a state of being (though it can be a state of being depending on what you "have")
[00:53:20] <LjL> in english you also have modal verbs like "can", "may", "must" that also modify the way the main verb is used

[02:26:09] <cousteau> What could "a viable device" mean? 
[02:26:55] <cousteau> I saw it in the news.  I think they mean "explosive device", but they never clarify it in the context 
[02:26:57] <MetaNova> a device which meets whatever criteria is at hand
[02:27:09] <MetaNova> context would help

[05:44:42] <LjL> Voxel, it's one possible way to word it, but i think twb's primary point was that "having changed" is a form that i wouldn't call incorrect, but maybe literally, and in regular english, "after changing" is what you'd say
[05:45:04] <LjL> "Did you start" vs "Have you tried starting" really comes down to the feeling you want to convey

[14:07:59] <dkdns> i've just learned that dachhund is pronounced "duxon"
[14:08:09] <Me-me> Well, sort of.
[14:08:30] <Me-me> If you want to do it right you use the german sound, which doesn't technically exist in normal english.
[14:08:48] <Me-me> Failing that, yeah, we go with duxon.
[14:08:57] <Me-me> Or, rather, dahx'n.
[14:09:26] <cousteau> Same for "advice/advise" (but apparently this isn't a US vs Br thing; it's always advice (n) / advise (v)) 
[14:09:55] <Me-me> Oh, yeah, centre was the original, and America went more phonetic.

[14:15:15] <cousteau> It comes from German, I think, "dachs hund", where the ch is not pronounced as in chocolate but as an /x/ (sort of a strong /h/), which I suppose in English ends up sounding like a /k/ (like the ch in school or chemistry) 
[14:17:38] <cousteau> So /daks (h)und/ -> ... -> "duxon" 
[14:18:51] <cousteau> (I'll be honest; if I heard "duxon" I'd have no idea what they were talking about either until I had seen it written)

[14:25:53] <Me-me> Well it's not really "duxon", it's "dahx'n", or even "dahx'nd".
[14:27:12] <cousteau> ("Hund" means "dog"; and apparently "Dachs" means "badger", or so this random webpage says) 
[14:27:23] <Me-me> Indeed.
[14:27:45] <cousteau> Badger dog 
[14:27:55] <cousteau> In Spanish we call them sausage dogs 
[14:28:14] <Me-me> Ah, I seem to recall something about how they were bred to hunt badgers.
[14:28:18] <Me-me> Could be wrong.
[14:28:43] <cousteau> Oh, so it's not because they look like badgers? 
[14:28:47] <Me-me> So a sausage is what they resemble, but a badger is what they're for :D
[14:29:23] <cousteau> Dunno, maybe you're wrong and they were actually bred to hunt sausages

[23:27:10] <hoyhoy> my sister made a text to show with my resume to help me to get a job
[23:27:23] *** Parts: solveig (sid194105@id-194105.uxbridge.irccloud.com) ()
[23:27:26] <hoyhoy> can someone correct it ? Im not native eng speaker 
[23:28:49] <fling> hoyhoy: /query me
[23:29:10] <blkshp> Why query you?
[23:29:33] <blkshp> hoyhoy: Explain "made me a text"
[23:29:57] <hoyhoy> blkshp she wrote a small text
[23:30:07] <hoyhoy> i'm copy pasting
[23:30:09] <blkshp> That doesn't really mean anything to me.
[23:30:24] <blkshp> Pastebin please.
[23:30:50] <fling> blkshp: my friend is hiring ;D
[23:31:07] <fling> hmm I like your nickname btw

[23:32:28] <fling> hoyhoy: are you good in java?
[23:32:31] <fling> hoyhoy: what about python?
[23:33:18] <hoyhoy> fling yes i have some project that are based on java and python
[23:33:40] <blkshp> My sister wrote a brief statement to show with my resume to help me to get a job
[23:33:44] <hoyhoy> but i just got my bsc so I haven't experience in the industry it's only personal and uni project
[23:33:54] <hoyhoy> blkshp yes it's better x)
[23:34:18] <blkshp> However I will add that it's unusual to use a family member as a reference.
[23:36:54] <bp99> hoyhoy â€˜havenâ€™t _got_ experienceâ€™ or â€˜have no experienceâ€™
[23:41:34] <bp99> Some apparent mistakes in the statement you sent include â€˜really valuableâ€™ (instead of â€˜real valuableâ€™,  which, afaik, is not correct, but often heard in spoken langauge), â€˜who has an exemplary workstyleâ€™, either ditch the â€˜satisfactionâ€™ part or rephrase (eg â€˜will surely be satisfactoryâ€™ or something), and â€˜passion _for_ computer scienceâ€™
