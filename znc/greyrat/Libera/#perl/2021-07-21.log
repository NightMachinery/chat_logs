[00:49:46] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: but people are so used to perlbrew I figured it was worth supporting that as a fallback too
[00:50:28] <ehuelsmann[m]> you did, I think, document it all or almost all; which is no guarantee for me to pick up the consequences what it says , or even just what it says.
[00:50:43] <ehuelsmann[m]> I did read it multiple times now, but I might still be missing some of the subtle details.
[00:50:51] <mst> it probably needs a bunch of recipe documents as well
[00:50:53] <ehuelsmann[m]> it's working well for me based on top of perlbrew.
[00:50:54] <mst> I'm better at man paage style
[00:51:32] <mst> right, yeah, it's, uh, 'simple as in scheme', or as in 'lego technix', it's intentionally a bunch of chunks o' stuff that you can combine basically however you like
[00:51:39] <ehuelsmann[m]> except for the fact (but I'm not sure where the problem lies yet) that dzil takes ages to even get to its first step when I run `dzil test`.
[00:51:55] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'm not sure whether that is due to the local `devel` directory, or what the cause is.
[00:51:56] *** phenom_ is now known as phenom
[00:52:10] <mst> that's odd, it *could* be @INC proliferation
[00:52:31] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'm running dzil through plx, actually.
[00:52:38] <ehuelsmann[m]> is that a bad idea?
[00:52:45] <mst> it shouldn't be a bad idea
[00:53:05] <mst> what I'm wondering is if it's something involving ending up with shitloads of directories in @INC and then stat()ing yourself to death
[00:53:20] <ehuelsmann[m]> "ages" being a minute, but that's a *lot* on this AMD Ryzen 7 4800U
[00:53:41] <mst> if my guess is right it's I/O not CPU that's killing you
[00:54:02] <ehuelsmann[m]> (on an NVME drive backed with 2300 GB/s)
[00:54:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'll check iotop next time I run dzil.
[00:54:19] <ehuelsmann[m]> that should give me a hint.
[00:54:25] <mst> I'd try 'strace' and see how many stat() calls you get
[00:54:43] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. thanks for the help! I'll be back when I know more.
[00:54:43] <mst> I have completely murderised myself before now with stat() overload via a combination of a big @INC and Module::Pluggable for example
[00:54:59] <mst> admittedly, by 'big' I mean 'a couple hundred entries'

[00:55:56] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: but yeah, if you have a custom/plenv/perl-build built perl, you can just give plx a path that resolves to it and it'll never bother trying perlbrew
[00:57:13] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I was happy with plenv before. I might try moving back to that.
[00:57:18] <ehuelsmann[m]> in combination with plx this time though.

[00:59:21] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: plenv honestly is 'perl-build plus a shell based wrapper that's less powerful than plx'
[00:59:27] <mst> note this is not a criticism
[00:59:46] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I never tried bare perl-build.
[00:59:48] <ehuelsmann[m]> maybe I should.
[00:59:54] <mst> and in fact implies 'plx for dev, plenv for deploy' is a perfectly viable approach (or, if it isn't, I fucked something up, because I absolutely intended that to work when I wrote plx)
[00:59:55] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'll have a look at it.
[01:00:21] <mst> perl-build is basically "the build part of perlbrew extracted out by the plenv author and available as a single fatpackable script'
[01:00:41] <mst> to the point where I keep seriously considering a superfat plx-packaged that bundled perl-build in
[01:00:58] <ehuelsmann[m]> the thing is that I don't really need (in my dev environment) need the "sticky" switching of the Perls, because I *want* to select different Perl versions.
[01:01:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> so, I guess that's exactly what you're saying.
[01:01:20] *** briand is now known as subie
[01:01:28] <ehuelsmann[m]> in that case I'll be better off with plx without plenv
[01:01:29] <mst> oh, yes, that part of perlbrew always sucked to me
[01:01:32] <mst> hence why plx doesn't bother
[01:01:52] <mst> there is no plx 'default perl' concept
[01:03:21] <mst> but IIRC plenv isn't about sticky switching either, it's mostly to have a single env per project much like plx
[01:04:09] *** Joins: splatt9990 (~chris@134.252.117.66.ded-dsl.fuse.net)
[01:04:31] <Grinnz> the plenv "shell" and "global" settings fit my brain well for dev - i don't use "local" cause i have no projects that need to pin their perl on there
[01:05:45] <Grinnz> and for deployment i just have a perl-build perl and call it explicitly

[01:11:22] <mst> perlbot: regex question
[01:11:22] <perlbot> mst: When you ask a regex question you won't get a good answer without three things: 1) The language it will be written in; 2) An example of the REAL input data, not a faked up version; and 3) What you need out and how you will use it.
[01:11:24] <leitz> Hmm....I'm trying to read the string up to but not including any "#" character.

[01:12:02] <mst> leitz: my $before_comment = $string =~ s/\s*#.*//r;

[01:13:57] <leitz> Yup, I read that the other day.
[01:14:17] <mst> leitz: PBP is not honestly very reflective of the real world

[01:17:36] <mst> mine also replaces the whole code
[01:17:53] <Grinnz> you could finagle it to leave off trailing spaces before the #, but honestly it's not worth it when you can just s/\s*$// it after

[05:06:04] <simcop2387> sorry about that, apparently the battery in my UPS is much worse off than I had expected
[05:06:09] <simcop2387> not even 20 seconds
[05:08:22] <bobsy> ouch
[05:08:27] <simcop2387> also, wth it's faster to get a new UPS than a battery for the ups.  not cheaper though
[05:08:47] <simcop2387> i can have a complete replacement UPS here friday, the battery itself might be 2-4 weeks.
[05:08:56] <bobsy> thanks covid
[05:09:45] <simcop2387> nah this one i think is the result of stupid weird warehouse and shipping restrictions
[05:10:07] <bobsy> how many VA is the ups?
[05:10:38] <simcop2387> 1500VA, https://www.amazon.com/APC-Back-UPS-Battery-Protector-BR1500G/dp/B003Y24DEU/
[05:10:41] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Amazon.com: APC 1500VA UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector with AVR, Back-UPS Pro Uninterruptibl... ]
[05:11:11] <bobsy> ryte
[05:11:39] <simcop2387> well new battery along with the 1500VA expansion pack on the way then.  that'll get me about 1.5 hours battery life on the whole rack then.
[05:12:18] <bobsy> that seems like a lot of backup time, whats the rack consume?
[05:12:38] <simcop2387> 350W at normal usage
[05:12:44] <simcop2387> it's a small rack
[05:12:53] <bobsy> noice
[05:13:27] <bobsy> i have a dl360p here, not sure how much it's consuming
[05:13:46] <bobsy> i could probably host half the stuff i do on my odroids which use next to nothing
[05:14:01] <simcop2387> perlbot: farnsworth 12 V 18 A hr / (350W) -> minutes
[05:14:02] <perlbot> simcop2387:  (1296/35  /* apx (37.0285714285714) */) 
[05:14:09] <simcop2387> bah i'm wrong about the time.  still that's pretty good.
[05:14:20] <bobsy> is that 37 mins?
[05:14:23] <jercos> and of course, your odroids can run directly off a battery out of the box.
[05:14:25] <simcop2387> yea
[05:14:31] <bobsy> jercos: yesh
[05:15:11] <bobsy> i actually made an odroid with an ata and a touchtone telephone and gsm module as a phone in my backpack ran off batteries
[05:15:33] <bobsy> still uses way more power than a modern mobile phone tho haha
[05:16:00] <jercos> idk, a modern mobile phone cranking the GPU full tilt gets *hot*
[05:16:13] <simcop2387> jercos: i'm going to try making a smallish set of my raspberry pis on the rack too.  all network booted and running github runners
[05:16:55] <bobsy> vmware for the rpi4 is neat, free.  but i think it requires an x86 controller

[05:17:04] <simcop2387> bobsy: yea i keep wanting to do that to a rotary phone for some reason.  then bolt it down somewhere and solar charge it.
[05:17:17] <jercos> nice :3
[05:17:33] <bobsy> simcop2387: my kid has her rotary phone hooked up to an ata then to my pbx
[05:17:41] <simcop2387> jercos: yea i cound some nice din rail mounts for pis that i'll use for it.  no need for fancy stuff for them.
[05:17:44] <bobsy> she loves old stuff
[05:18:09] <jercos> good technology never dies, it just finds a new place
[05:18:11] <simcop2387> bobsy: i've got win10 on a pi4 right now, for hopefully getting arm64 support for strawberry perl going
[05:18:36] <simcop2387> wonder if win10 on vmware might be slightly more stable actually...
[05:18:37] <bobsy> simcop2387: lacking a few drivers still?
[05:18:48] <bobsy> yeah would be imho
[05:18:51] <simcop2387> yea i have to use a usb ethernet adapter and it doesn't do much else.
[05:19:12] <simcop2387> it's enough for a build server though
[05:20:06] <simcop2387> ooo, proxmox might be nicer
[05:20:22] <bobsy> i use proxmox on my dl360p
[05:20:47] <bobsy> it's very good
[05:21:10] <bobsy> im slowly learning kubenetes and docker tho to transition in the future
[05:21:18] <simcop2387> https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/n4d7ev/now_running_proxmox_on_a_raspberry_pi_4_cluster/ # ok this might be my weekend project for it all
[05:21:21] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Now running Proxmox on a Raspberry Pi 4 cluster : Proxmox ]
[05:21:23] <bobsy> openstack is good, but not stable yet
[05:21:26] <bobsy> oh neat!
[05:22:49] <simcop2387> genio: i'm gonna wipe and re-setup that pi4 with windows.  i think this might end up much much nicer in the end.  since i'll be able to make snapshots of it and everything

[19:26:26] <Altreus> "bin" is an interesting one because it almost never contains binary
[19:26:29] <Grinnz> the problems with use English are 1) performance 2) no perl programmers actually know those variable names
[19:26:33] <Altreus> but... who uses src instead of lib?

[19:28:22] <leont> If I would encounter it in code, I would first ask why it's there in the first place, not why it's spelled in a particular way
[19:29:31] <pragma-> If all your variables were named $a, $b, $c ... I mean, spellings/names are quite important. And $" is not a spelling or name anybody can easily understand without having prior experience with it.
[19:30:08] <leont> A lot of magical variables only make sense in whipuptitude perl anyway.

[20:43:57] <Altreus> Oh for the days computers can reason about architecture
[20:44:04] <curdlesnoot> mjgardner: after all, either you want to unpack arguments or you don't. that rather precludes arguging over whether it should be by way of @_ or shift.

[20:45:40] <curdlesnoot> well, as mjgardner says, it's an expressive language. nobody's going to agree on everything. I don't care for $_[0] much either, even though I have no problem reading it.
[20:45:57] <Altreus> no indeed

[21:54:56] <Altreus> what a situation
[21:55:01] <Altreus> Where the heck did it come from?
[21:55:39] <gryphn> It's a data file from an older Windows application install. So my first thought was Access, but that's not it.
[21:56:12] <Altreus> ah, so possibly it used its own extension but for a standard format?
[21:56:22] <Altreus> but not one file(1) has heard of
[21:56:24] <gryphn> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking (hoping).
[21:56:43] <Altreus> the better line of investigation might be to go via that application
[21:56:51] <Altreus> or whoever made it

[21:57:36] <gryphn> Yeah, I feel I'm at that point. The company that made the app no longer exists. So it's going to be fun...
[21:59:03] <Altreus> Time for investigative journalism!
[21:59:22] <alh> What's the filename?
[21:59:36] <thrig> Click here to read about these five wacky file formats
[21:59:41] <Altreus> honestly if I were gonna be paid to follow a paper trail that led me to find out who worked for a gone company that wrote obsolete software...
