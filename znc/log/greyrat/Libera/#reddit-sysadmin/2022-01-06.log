[07:37:27] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> I don't want advice on what im trying to do, i'm not trying ot do anything other than what happens to the policy in question
[07:37:58] <xe0n> okay cool, so if you apply a wmi filter to a policy, only objects (computer\user) that match that filter will read the policy and process it
[07:38:28] <xe0n> computer objects read computer configuration settings, user objects read user configuration settings, if you want computers to apply user configuration settings you use loopback processing
[07:38:56] <xe0n> i.e a case where you might use loopback processing to apply user configuration to a PC is in RDS environments
[07:39:09] <xe0n> tbh i use loopback a lot, helps with managing gpos, but that's also up to how you organise you policy objects

[07:50:04] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> Someone has removed it from the Default Domain Policy
[07:50:18] <xe0n> eh thats fine, as long as it's being applied in a policy object that pcs are reading it
[07:50:18] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> Then created a "Global" policy (root level) and with the enforce option, and set it there.
[07:50:23] <xe0n> right
[07:50:24] <xe0n> Lol
[07:50:29] <xe0n> turn off enforce for starters
[07:50:34] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> However said Global policy has a WMI filter on it.
[07:50:43] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> Which means it won't affect any computers in the domain (basically).
[07:50:47] <xe0n> well...remove the wmi filter lol

[07:51:03] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> Then there's a seperate OU underneath, with inheritence blocking enabled
[07:51:08] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> With the password policy set in a policy there again.
[07:51:09] <xe0n> well no wonder..

[07:51:36] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> and THAT policy also has a WMI filter on it.. but as far as i can tell that one will actually resolve to true.
[07:51:55] <xe0n> psssh remove the wmi filters, have a single password policy object, apply to pcs
[07:51:57] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> My recommendation is to burn the entire domain and start again tbh
[07:52:10] <xe0n> can't have multiple password policies unless you use fine grained password (pso)

[07:52:14] <xe0n> lol
[07:52:16] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> From what i read online just then, you cant actually set the password plicy
[07:52:18] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> Exactly.
[07:52:34] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> The whole blocking inhertience and recreating a new plicy doesnt work from what i read.
[07:52:36] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> It just ignores it.
[07:52:39] <xe0n> yes you can...you just need to undo all the junk ones, set one to an ou (or root..) and remove the stupid wmi filter
[07:52:47] <sd> 07<N​ostalgiac> And would go off the (broken) (global) policy set a tthe root.

[12:54:56] *** Joins: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi)
[12:58:08] <yuken> SirSceptalot, I need a facial mask that's going to block as much crap from my mouth & nose as possible, and restrict airflow, for working with something that can be easily contaminated by stuff that clings to saliva droplets and moving air.
[12:58:19] <yuken> what does my Dutch friend recommend?
[12:58:41] <DrZak> ductape
[12:58:47] <SirSceptalot> haha
[12:58:53] <DrZak> try to learn to breath through your pores
[12:59:03] <yuken> DrZak, that would legitimately work if it only took like 15-30 seconds to do.
[12:59:35] <SirSceptalot> what on earth are you going to do that has that type of demands?
[12:59:54] <SirSceptalot> I'm not tall enough to be Dutch btw
[12:59:56] <DrZak> i mean, in theory you can wring a large plastic bag and a string, ther should be enough air in the bag for 30 minutes 
[13:00:01] <DrZak> and a eggtimer
[13:00:20] <yuken> A plastic bag with eye hole cutouts actually might work.
[13:00:47] <DrZak> if its transparent you dont even need that
[13:01:10] <SirSceptalot> This is fairly obvious I'd assume, but once you cut the eyeholes the airtightness might be somewhat comromised.
[13:01:18] <yuken> mhmm.
[13:01:23] <SirSceptalot> s/mr/mpr
[13:01:23] <layer8> SirSceptalot meant: "This is fairly obvious I'd assume, but once you cut the eyeholes the airtightness might be somewhat compromised."
[13:04:17] <SirSceptalot> idk how sensitive your stuff is yuken, but why not simply a 3M respirator or the likes?
[13:04:35] <SirSceptalot> if you don't have a beard there's plenty of options
[13:04:46] <yuken> SirSceptalot, ambient air may contain contaminates, having as little air movement in front of my face is important.
[13:05:29] <CableNinja> have you considered a bunny suit and mask? with goggles?
[13:05:34] <SirSceptalot> are you trying to prevent stuff from geting into your face, or stuff from into your face from disturbing what's in front of you?
[13:05:58] <yuken> The latter.
[13:06:15] <yuken> If I can restrict or redirect airflow that'd work.
[13:06:22] <SirSceptalot> redirect is good?
[13:06:26] <SirSceptalot> a snorkel
[13:06:29] <DrZak> there are also many fancy latex suits available
[13:06:33] <yuken> a snorkel might work.
[13:06:33] <SirSceptalot> and nose clip
[13:06:35] <DrZak> though, they dont seem to have eye holes
[13:06:50] <SirSceptalot> a true jedi can use his other senses
[13:06:52] <DrZak> just cut the hole and put in ski glasses
[13:07:01] <yuken> lol
[13:08:36] <SirSceptalot> idk, if you can do a test run first just try out a simple respirator, unless you have a snorkel handy
[13:09:43] <SirSceptalot> or see if you can pick up a second hand full face mask that's normally used in conjunction with a back-mounted powered air filter
[13:09:50] <SirSceptalot> like professional painters use
[13:10:18] <SirSceptalot> if you only need to redirect the airflow you can just sling the tube over your shoulder
[13:11:27] <SirSceptalot> on the other hand, I think the world record for holding one's breath is something like 8 minutes? How long does your task take? :p
[13:11:41] <SirSceptalot> oh shit
[13:11:45] <SirSceptalot> it's actually 24 minutes
[13:15:54] <yuken> god damn.

[14:50:10] <teh_f4ll3n> that's fine I run a bunch of catalyst switches

[14:50:26] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> yea, it's bsically, if you're used to cisco IOS

[14:51:18] <teh_f4ll3n> also, we're not large enough to warrant a squid setup anyway
[14:51:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> well, squid caching is what i primarily used at home when i used to run pfsense
[14:51:47] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[14:51:54] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so that's why i brought it up

[15:06:51] <Kiernian> yeah, and canary domain which I have
[15:08:07] <Kiernian> and the short answer is that ESSENTIALLY... HR thinks it should be a solvable technical problem so they don't have to do HR things
[15:10:54] <teh_f4ll3n> I hate the way you can't update the remote IP in AWS VPN settings
[15:11:18] <teh_f4ll3n> have to delete the existing one and set up a new
[15:11:32] <Kiernian> is there something about half the power of a fortiproxy 400e? that's something of overkill for 200 endpoints
[15:15:37] <Kiernian> oh, it looks like fortiproxy is a vm-only offering nowadays. hrm. 
[15:16:20] <Kiernian> uck. I'll sort through models later.
[15:18:11] <teh_f4ll3n> why the fuck wouldn't AWS allow FQDNs in the customer gateway settings?
[15:20:31] <teh_f4ll3n> this is the 3rd time I'm rebuilding the VPN this year due to us moving to a different address
[15:22:25] <sd> 11<H​otmess> for the site to site vpn?
[15:22:29] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[15:22:31] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah it is a bit of fuck
[15:22:49] <sd> 11<H​otmess> you could always use vxlan on your stuff instead

[15:25:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> for point to point ipsec yeah
[15:27:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lol even shit ass Azure lets you chose between FQDN and IP
[15:28:03] <sd> 11<H​otmess> you can always spin up an vyos container to do it for you

[15:40:33] <teh_f4ll3n> Activ8, that's not my point

[15:40:48] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Yes that was a vague question
[15:42:02] <teh_f4ll3n> Activ8, my point is that I'm having to rebuild the VPN the 2nd time this year because we moved premises. AWS won't allow you to update the existing gateway IP, and don't allow you to use an FQDN
[15:43:04] <Activ8> not even by command line?
[15:43:30] <Kiernian> when as a function of epoch time too, not just calendar time. 6 feet of snow in the north in the late 1970's? Sure! Now? not so much.

[21:16:54] <Activ8> @K​illnine no-one should be flipping out when someone suggests things.  Everyone is entitled to an opinion and recommendations and it's up to the company to listen.
[21:16:55] <sd> 14<K​illnine> It's probably worse that using unshielded cable at that point 😄
[21:17:26] <sd> 14<K​illnine> My issue wasn't with the shielding it was with what, exactly, made that cable 'better' than what I was finding for $250-350/spool
[21:17:26] <Activ8> Us as an MSP with the company I work for, we let the customer choose.  We recommend things to them, why we recommend them and the costings involved.
[21:17:48] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I couldnt' get a data sheet or anything. It was just 'oh this uses some solid copper not that cheap chinese stuff'
[21:18:02] <Activ8> if a customer wants something they can have it.  It's their choice to understand the differences between products.  We only present the costs and reasoning to them.
[21:18:39] <sd> 14<K​illnine> He would have absolutely put in what I asked him to but made it very clear he wasn't going to support it. And, honestly, at that point I felt kinda threatened he could sabotage the install just to make his point.
[21:19:03] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Which....obviously is not what you want out of your MSP, lol
[21:19:06] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Yea the customer should absolutely be allowed to foot gun themselves, unless you have to support it too.
[21:19:34] <vinrock> i got a hankerin' for a cheesesteak
[21:20:03] <vinrock> and a beer
[21:20:19] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yeah, and I am coming from a position of ignorance here. I dont know if there's some sort of spec beyond the gauge of wire that makes one cable better than another or if there's some kinda standard to look for or certification
[21:20:23] <Activ8> If you want something that's fine.  We would clearly state if we would support a product after install.  An MSP doesn't have to support something if they don't want to.  That choice would be up to you if you wanted them to install that product.
[21:20:54] <Activ8> He's right to say he won't support it though.  That's a choice of the MSP.  A MSPs best interest is never to sabotage something.
[21:21:17] <vinrock> he should convey his opinions gracefully though
[21:21:27] <fritzwastaken> mmmm free pizza
[21:21:33] <Activ8> If it was us, and a customer wanted us to install a product we knew nothing about, we would install it then they would have to get some other company to support it.
[21:21:35] <vinrock> nice
[21:21:42] <Activ8> unless we wanted to support it ofc
[21:21:44] <fritzwastaken> and they actually get good pizza

[21:23:14] <vinrock> its a different dough, pie is rectangular baked in a sheet
[21:23:22] <vinrock> topping is kinda like a margherita pie
[21:23:26] <fritzwastaken> Grandma pizza is a distinct thin, rectangular style of pizza attributed to Long Island, New York. Typically topped with cheese and tomato sauce, it is reminiscent of pizzas baked at home by Italian housewives who lacked a pizza oven. The pizza is often compared to Sicilian pizza
[21:23:27] <vinrock> but chunky tomato sauce
[21:23:38] <vinrock> there ya go
[21:23:39] <fritzwastaken> I mean, thats a pretty generic pizza slice
[21:23:48] <Activ8> that's crazy price
[21:23:51] <vinrock> its really the dough that makes it different

[21:37:37] <Activ8> depends what's included in that 10% is it every single windows server or just ones with certain roles
[21:37:55] <Kiernian> depends on whether or not you count 365 in the cloud as a windows server, as opposed to on-premesis exchange
[21:38:56] <Kiernian> when you consider how many MSPs have moved clients from on prem exchange to 365 in the last 10 years, it certainly accounts for a TON of previously on-site servers
[21:41:41] <fritzwastaken> it also depends on your definition of a server
[21:42:09] <fritzwastaken> is a JBOD running a small linux OS for management considered a server
[21:43:39] <Kiernian> right. if you count every external raid array, alarm panel, and internet-connected thermostat out there, the numbers skew a ton, too.

[22:44:19] <fritzwastaken> we had guys we would contract out to massive companies to write out their policy and train their employees
[22:44:24] <sd> 07<n​urgle> god made stackoverflow and copy paste for a reason.
[22:44:56] <JollyRoger> Right now I'm uh... trying to get SELinux working on my POWER9 box. However there are no profiles for it available so there is nothing for me to work off of. So I'm trying a lot of it out by process of experimentation. 
[22:45:50] <JollyRoger> So far I've been able to get the box to boot with it in Enforcing but without the policies there it can't do much, so I have it disabled, but I'm hoping to fix that in the future.

[22:50:01] <JollyRoger> That sounds really hardcore!
[22:50:02] <fritzwastaken> and seeing my coworkers working with them on some of the specific policies was like splitting hairs
[22:50:27] <fritzwastaken> I never want to administer that stuff, its insanity
