[00:12:03] <Walex> Oblomov: 'git' is Source Control Management, not Continuous Integration. Things like '-x make' are hacks/conveniences, and that is as far as they go.
[00:13:14] <Oblomov> Walex: sorry but that's completely irrelevant. during a rebase you want to make sure each rebased commit still builds/tests successfully, and -x make to git rebase is THE way to ensure that
[00:13:31] <Oblomov> it has nothing to do with continuous integration

[04:56:58] <fructose> blahboybaz: Why would anyone stay on freenode?
[04:57:06] <blahboybaz> :)
[04:57:12] <blahboybaz> Well I had to ask
[04:58:53] <blahboybaz> So I wasn't really sure what to look up but I heard a new release of git is changing the default name of the first branch to main instead of master. Is tha backwards compatible? If not, what has to be done when considering an upgrade to the newest version?
[04:59:46] <oprypin> blahboybaz, it affects creation of new repositories. if you want a particuar value whenever creating repositories, you can configure that
[04:59:47] <nedbat> blahboybaz: you can choose the name of the first branch.  you can also change the name later if you want.
[05:01:31] <blahboybaz> I found out about it from gitlab documentation and I guess my first impresison is that my old repos with master branch would break. Maybe I'm not seeing what any breakage may be related to (who/what responsible for the breakage)? Is that a gitlab thing or ..
[05:01:45] <nedbat> blahboybaz: your repos won't break.
[05:02:00] <blahboybaz> I'm confused. I want to upgrade but not sure if I have to do some reconfiguration to prevent breakage of old repos with upstream or something
[05:02:12] <nedbat> blahboybaz: you don't have to do anything. upgrade, it will work.
[05:02:23] <blahboybaz> Cool
[05:11:09] <blahboybaz> Always feels good getting new software :)

[10:03:13] <ross> Walex: thanks for your advice yesterday, sorry I didn't get a chance to respond! Re why it needs to be in its own repository, the 'feature' was a specialised editor for a certain file in the project, and I realised that in the future I would want to use that same editor for similar projects. So I extract it out to its own repository and will work on it there, as a generic version not tied to any particular project

[19:24:54] <ross> Walex: that seems like a gotcha for the sake of it? "subprojects" is not a specific term for anything as far as I'm aware, unless you meant submodules, an[19:27:43] <Walex> ross: oh please. You have workflows, and these are reflected in SCM setups. In order to discuss properly the options for SCM setups you have to describe your workflow first, and "project" is a workflow-level term. Whether a project made of subprojects should be supported by an SCM-level 'git' "submodules" setup is jumping ahead.

[19:30:27] <Walex> ross: it is a classic X vs. Y situation, nothing bad or unusual.
[19:33:16] <ross> in the context of a git user asking how to do these things in a git help channel, I don't think I can be expected to know that "project" means something specific to a high-level git user - or that you are using these terms in a specific sense in the first place (e.g. you use the term subprojects in this case to refer to the two repositories rather than in a general nonspecific way)
[19:34:43] <ross> coming in here and asking "hi all, there are subprojects in my project, what should do?" as I slightly-disingenuously infer that you would've preferred that I ask doesn't make any sense to me
[19:36:23] <Walex> Guest8: SQLite? Views? The 'git' angle here is that SqLite dump files can be easily stores in 'git' allowing you to track changes too.

[22:20:16] <jaggz> oh actually his has this additional word 'feature' in there. not sure what that is
[22:20:24] <jaggz> I can git checkout remotes/origin/feature/foobar

[22:21:16] <ikke> or git checkout -t origin/feature/foobar
[22:22:04] <jaggz> so if I use "remotes" on there, I'm explicitly telling git NOT to track it locally?
[22:22:30] <ikke> the full name is: refs/remotes/origin/feature/foobar
[22:22:52] <ikke> if you checkout remotes/origin/feature/foobar, git will just checkout the commit that it points to
[22:22:57] <j416> jaggz: git checkout foo is just shorthand for git checkout -t refs/remotes/origin/foo, in case it exits
[22:23:00] <j416> exists*

[22:23:29] *** x88x88x is now known as x88x88x88x
[22:23:32] <ikke> in that case, it automatically will create the branch, pointing at the same commit as refs/remotes/origin/feature/foobar
[22:25:16] <jaggz> okay, ahh..  so -t (track) is the thing.. so it creates my own local branch with the upstream tracking stuff set
[22:25:23] <ikke> yes
