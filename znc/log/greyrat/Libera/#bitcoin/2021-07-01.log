[01:10:42] <gfetge53> is there a trustworthy source where I can download the current valid chainstate from, such that I can compare it with my own and verify that I synchronized correctly?
[01:11:17] <gfetge53> just to be extra sure
[01:12:10] <earnestly> That's what is happening all the time
[01:13:23] <earnestly> If you're using bitcoin-core anyway
[01:13:44] *** Joins: kico (~kico@user/kico)
[01:13:45] <gfetge53> no I mean like a zip folder with the entire chainstate that is obtained independently from the synchronization process
[01:14:39] <gfetge53> this is to verify that the synchronization process itself was correctly executed, not to verify that the chainstate is correct
[01:15:21] <earnestly> gfetge53: I'd point bitcoind at the directory you extract it to and use verifychain
[01:15:45] <earnestly> Hm, I'm not sure what 'sychronization process' is here

[01:16:15] <belcher> gfetge53 what you're asking for doesnt make sense
[01:16:28] <gfetge53> why not?
[01:16:48] <belcher> 1) theres no way to get a chainstate folder without synchronizing a full node 2) to create that other folder someone else has to do synchronization, and you'd have to trust them
[01:17:18] <belcher> i dont know what you believe you're protecting against, but its pretty unlikely that bitcoin core or another full node will verify incorrectly

[01:19:39] <gfetge53> I'd have to trust them if that's the only source I used, but that's not what I'm asking... I'm also doing a full synchronization myself
[01:20:19] <gfetge53> I just would like to compare if my result is the same as that of some trustworthy source, just to be extra sure everything went fine
[01:20:45] *** Joins: Peppi- (~Peppi@user/peppi)
[01:21:18] <belcher> why not only do a full synchronization yourself?
[01:21:24] <belcher> such a trustworthy source does not exist
[01:21:36] <belcher> also if it did exist it would somewhat undermine the value of bitcoin as a decentralized system
[01:21:57] <gfetge53> what it would protect me against is me somehow having made a mistake along the way that could have caused me to start a synchronization process that isn't correct
[01:22:17] <belcher> thats simply not likely
[01:22:28] <belcher> the sync process doesnt ask anything from you the user
[01:22:54] <belcher> only that you provide it enough disk space, RAM, and other resources, and if it doesnt have those it will just shut down with an error message, it wont sync wrongly
[01:23:10] <belcher> (note, the disk space requirement is only about 4gb if you enable pruning)
[01:23:19] <gfetge53> it does... I need to execute it, I need to obtain it correctly, I need to verify that my computer doesn't contain malware etc...
[01:23:45] *** Quits: Peppi (~Peppi@user/peppi) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[01:23:54] <belcher> verifying with another chainstate doesnt solve any of those issues, it just compounds them
[01:24:31] <gfetge53> it doesn't solve them, but it does make them just a little tiny bit less likely
[01:24:53] <gfetge53> that's why I said just to be "extra" sure
[01:25:46] <belcher> what is much more possible for you to do is sync your own node and then run the command `getbestblockhash` and ask around on this IRC or check various websites to see if other people have the same one
[01:25:56] <belcher> for example my own node right now reports 00000000000000000000551da4684e68162790bbb7586a911ed8ce8e477b4a41
[01:26:17] <belcher> if that hashes match then your own node is on the same chain as other people's
[01:26:27] <Enki[m]> you sync the longest accepted chain right? If you synced the "wrong" chain wouldn't the whole network be running a "bad" copy of the chain? (I guess we wouldn't know unless someone caught the fork.)
[01:27:06] <gfetge53> yeah that's exactly what I meant, just for all the hashes of the chainstate, instead of just 1 hash
[01:27:48] <belcher> those hashes contain commitments to all previous hashes, so checking the tip is enough
[01:27:58] <belcher> block headers contain the hash of the previous block you see
[01:30:24] <earnestly> Hence 'chain', heh
[01:30:35] *** Joins: sed (~sed@pool-100-7-38-116.rcmdva.fios.verizon.net)
[01:31:57] <gfetge53> but not all UTXOs have to be in that particular block right?
[01:33:21] <belcher> no, they could be in any previous block, but the block at the tip commits to them all
[01:33:32] <gfetge53> it is my understanding that the chainstate is the entire UTXO set, thus my reasoning was that a subset of this would not be in that last block which makes verifying only that last hash not enough
[01:33:53] <gfetge53> ah like that

[19:21:56] <Evolver> A journalist needs to write about the climate case for Bitcoin. The argument is that the current climate problems exist due to hyper economic growth caused by global binging on debt. This debt is a result of inflationary fiat. The adoption of Bitcoin will due to its deflationary nature slow down this unreasonable and unsustainable economic growth caused by a debt overload, thereby arresting climate problems.

[21:20:32] <plankers> neat
[21:20:50] <nanotube> caveman: see above, usually old-style stuff remains valid as well. though i suppose if the old-style stuff becomes completely broken and needs to be phased out, then... that might happen too.

[22:56:44] <as2333> caveman, but what madness are you talking about anyway. Yes, so far there's been a pattern in the price. It reaches a peak, falls to ~2/10 and then reaches a higher peak.
[22:57:19] <caveman> yes, so where is btc expected to land?  it can't exponentiate forever.
[22:57:50] <as2333> ask any charlatan who pretends to predict the future
[22:58:35] <as2333> also the supply is limited at 21 millions (not billions) and I doubt there's any 'plan' to change that.
