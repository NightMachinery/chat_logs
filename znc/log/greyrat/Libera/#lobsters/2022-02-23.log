[00:01:12] <JordiGH> But those five given names only appear on her birth certificate and nowhere else.
[00:01:38] <bsandro> you can only say "My name is <name>, you killed my father, prepare to die" if your name is spanish for example
[00:02:24] <JordiGH> But his name is Basque, not Spanish.
[00:02:48] <andrhua> damn I wish we had that many names, my team has 4 people with the same first name and others refer to them formally using patronyc
[00:03:12] <JordiGH> Actually a cute attention to detail that they made sure both names of that character are Basque.

With an upper class background on his father's side set against a predominantly working-class electorate [he has

[10:32:58] <kline> i dont know what you expect
[10:33:25] <rtpg> Lol I know but it's like... imagine if you set them up to run at like... I dunno, P3 speeds
[10:33:46] <kline> if you double-triple the price you spend, itll be more feasible
[10:34:12] <kline> youll probably even come out ahead on cost given youll spend less time pulling and reprovisioning failed phones
[10:34:38] <rtpg> Well I guess my main angle is more about reusing this stuff that otherwise can go at the landfill (like this store will sometimes have a bunch of like, iphone 4s for the same price as well), but is _theoretically_ power efficient and usable as a general computing device
[10:35:32] <rtpg> But what people seem to say in practice is that all the phones they've tried this on just have heat failures cuz they're note made to be active 24 hours a day. Saying that out loud now makes me wonder if you could do a thing like... just cycle 1 hour on, 5 hours off or something....

[13:43:23] <gerikson> pls lern newspeak
[13:43:24] <river> im not sure this is true
[13:43:37] <river> I need to refresh on shellshock
[13:45:18] <river> so shellshock happened because CGI web apps use env vars, and env vars can take values AND functions.. and there was a bug in parsing functions that meant it executed code
[13:45:38] <arnt> good/bad is partly a matter of fashion, truth is permanent.
[13:45:39] <river> ok so he's actually right on this one?
[13:45:54] <river> parsing and execution should be completely separate phases
[13:46:01] <river> if that had been the case, shellshock would not have happened
[13:46:10] <sniglom> So what is truth then? And how can you be sure that something is truth?
[13:46:16] <ripx80> its harder to implement and check, but you can use both
[13:46:54] <river> regarding log4j.. I think that it was because format strings were being provided dynamically, rather than statically
[13:47:06] <river> gcc gives you a compiler warning/error if you pass a variable into printf format strings
[13:47:19] <river> a custom formatter in java unfortunately doesn't have that
[13:47:28] <c355E3B> Oh but it does
[13:47:39] <river> well.. hopefully they added support now :)
[13:47:45] <river> to their library
[13:49:01] <arnt> river, that's possible in java.
[13:49:10] <river> it's not so much 'dynamic parsing' as parse/execute being interconnected and when you try to just parse you can end up accidentally executing too
[13:50:09] <river> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/14.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst github supports rst, why isn't it more popular?

[13:50:27] <iDrougge> river: Why should GCC warn about that?
[13:50:42] <river> iDrougge: because it can lead to crashes and stuff
[13:51:22] <iDrougge> GCC should have a warning when you run it every time: "Improper (most) use of C can lead to crashes and stuff"
[13:51:26] <river> lol
[13:51:59] <iDrougge> Speaking of error messages, this was a new one to me: "Error parsing Infinity value. Path '', line 1, position 2."
[13:52:07] <river> part of the value is to locate uses of this anti-pattern in existing code and fix them

[15:43:28] <arnt> because of sentences such as this (which contains a link to https://lobste.rs) perhaps?
[15:43:40] <river> ah!
[15:43:43] <river> that makes sense
[15:43:52] <arnt> ( is generally after a space, ) generally not.
[15:43:56] <river> so I think that web browsers should automatically url encode the )
[15:43:58] <pushcx> to avoid grabbing trailing punctuation in parentheticals like (https://example.com) this
[15:44:11] <river> wikipedia puts ) in urls, so something needs to be done
[15:44:29] <pushcx> (ah, I was too slow - so will just note that Slack does a great job at figuring out what punctuation is or isn't part of the URL)
[15:45:01] <river> yes you could be smart about it and look for a '(' inside the URL...
[15:45:11] <river> but that's heading into dangerous territory
[15:48:06] <kline> river, thats purely a client thing

[19:59:04] <JordiGH> I worked (well, work, until this Friday) for this company: https://ecometrica.com
[19:59:05] <mockturtle> [ Sustainability Reporting and Downstream Space - Ecometrica ] - ecometrica.com
[19:59:41] <JordiGH> Companies hire us to do their reporting. We know how to do it and supposedly we're good because we're a neutral third party with an interest in accuracy.
[20:00:32] <JordiGH> We actually don't have a lot of competitors. I believe we have the biggest database of emission factors in the world.
[20:00:53] <acegalla-> yeaahhhhhhhhhh. wow
[20:01:40] <acegalla-> huh. I find this stuff really interesting. this girl is working in the a department for a major american manufacturer that interfacess with you company ('climate reporting division')
[20:01:49] <acegalla-> and I've been talking with her nonstop about the dynamics of this

[20:03:01] <acegalla-> "we hired a neutral third party, they're the best of the best, here's what they found"
[20:03:10] <acegalla-> it's a pretty vacuous action
[20:03:51] <JordiGH> Some of our clients are better than others.
[20:04:12] <JordiGH> There's a logistics company that really is invested in reducing their emissions. And our reports show that they really are doing it.
[20:04:26] <JordiGH> Their employees are a bunch of tree-hugging hippies, though, so that helps.

[20:05:38] <JordiGH> You guys get to hear the rest of it.
[20:06:38] <technomancy> you found out you were holding it wrong this whole time??
[20:07:01] <JordiGH> No, the right ctrl key really isn't there, no matter how I hold it.
[20:07:17] <technomancy> hold it upside down, then the ctrl key will be on the right
[20:07:20] <JordiGH> Also, they didn't send me a dongle, so I can't plug in a real keyboard into this. I'll have to ask for one.
[20:07:30] <JordiGH> my god, you're a genius
[20:07:42] <technomancy> you gotta Think Different™ Jordi
[20:07:51] <_rubik> I curse that they split ctrl and "cmd" every day. Makes swapping between systems such a pain
[20:10:26] <gwozniak> I really like having Cmd and Ctrl keys
[20:10:56] <_rubik> gwozniak: interesting. What's your perspective?
[20:11:38] <acegalla-> JordiGH: why did you leave ecometrica?
[20:12:33] <technomancy> _rubik: it's nice to have ctrl distinct from super because the latter is reserved for the WM and will never be bound by an application, but I guess on mac it doesn't work that way?
[20:12:41] <technomancy> not sure what the point would be then
[20:13:00] <gwozniak> _rubik: Ctrl is already overloaded.  Having Cmd available for the system is much nicer
[20:13:21] <JordiGH> acegalla-: 140% salary increase at New Relic.
[20:13:33] <aja> honestly, that's the one thing I miss the most when moving from OSX to Linux: Cmd-C/Cmd-V is copy/paste everywhere.
[20:13:45] <iDrougge> What gwozniak said.
[20:13:50] <acegalla-> fair enough
[20:13:55] <JordiGH> Emacs is the system.
[20:13:55] <acegalla-> probably make way more money than me
[20:13:57] <aja> ctrl-c to copy in browser, ctrl-shift-v to paste in a terminal... <3
[20:13:59] <JordiGH> Emacs uber alles.
[20:14:05] <JordiGH> If it doesn't work in Emacs, it doesn't work.
[20:14:06] <iDrougge> aja: So what is it in Linux?
[20:14:13] <Xe> aja: control-insert shift-insert
[20:14:30] <aja> insert is so far away from home row!
[20:14:33] <gwozniak> Cmd-V on macOS
[20:14:37] <technomancy> wait I've been doing shift-insert for decades and I've never heard of ctrl-insert before
[20:14:39] <gwozniak> At least with iTerm
[20:14:48] <technomancy> mind blown dot gif
[20:15:13] <aja> iDrougge: if I mix it up and hit ctrl-shift-c in a browser it opens the developer tools, and if I hit ctrl-c instead of ctrl-shift-c in a terminal it kills the process :D
[20:15:20] <_rubik> S-ins is best paste
[20:15:36] <wink> it doesn't work in some places
[20:15:39] <gwozniak> yeah
[20:15:47] <wink> but I also never heard of ctrl-insert I think
[20:15:50] <gwozniak> It really annoys me
[20:16:02] <JordiGH> So at Grownup Software Companies, does everyone just use mac de rigueur?

[20:16:09] <_rubik> gwozniak: I like having super and ctrl shift, I'm just not a fan of moving c/p to command seemingly arbitrarily.
[20:16:10] <technomancy> I moved insert to being right below X
[20:16:12] <iDrougge> aja: Who wrote the Linux human interface guidelines?
[20:16:19] <technomancy> makes it a lot more handy for pasting
[20:16:20] <ngoldbaum> iterm2 also somehow better than all linux terminal emulators
[20:16:22] <aja> JordiGH: M-w and C-w delight me :D
[20:16:24] * ngoldbaum trolls
[20:16:27] <gwozniak> JordiGH: I use a Mac at work, but Windows is the norm here
[20:16:35] <aja> ahahahahaha trolls indeed
[20:16:43] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: yeah, it is, actually
[20:16:52] * ngoldbaum truthfully trolls
[20:16:55] <ngoldbaum> it really is
[20:17:03] <gwozniak> Also better than Windows Terminal
[20:17:16] <gwozniak> Which, to be fair, isn't bad
[20:17:39] <JordiGH> So is it only my dinky little company that graciously let me use a Linux laptop for all of these years with no company-installed spyware?
[20:17:46] <technomancy> I remain convinced that the old windows terminal was bad on purpose to convince windows users to not learn how command line stuff works
[20:17:54] <ngoldbaum> no a lot of smaller companies are like that
[20:18:07] <gwozniak> JordiGH: company installed spyware is mandatory on Linux here, too
[20:18:08] <JordiGH> But every large company just gives everyone a spywared mac?
[20:18:09] <technomancy> JordiGH: yeah, any time your company gets above a certain size the spyware becomes a regulatory requirement
[20:18:10] <Ticho> technomancy: that's an interesting new conspiracy theory
[20:18:10] <iDrougge> I have only once worked at a company with spyware (or antivirus or whatever).
[20:18:20] <ngoldbaum> chance of needing to install falcon or carbon black goes up with valuation
[20:18:45] <JordiGH> gwozniak: Oh, so companies do exist with linux laptops, okay.
[20:18:47] <gwozniak> Not using such stuff is a security nightmare, I bet
[20:18:49] <technomancy> if you're lucky you'll get a company whose spyware is portable
[20:18:55] <ngoldbaum> cyberattacks are a real thing, they have a different threat model than you do
[20:18:58] <gwozniak> Even though it is also usability nightmare
[20:19:04] <iDrougge> technomancy: Was that the idea behind the Unix command line too?
[20:19:21] <technomancy> everyone at work is always up in arms about how slow the mac spyware makes their machines

[20:20:14] <gwozniak> I do stuff in a Linux VM because it's nearly intolerable otherwise.  Literally hours to build stuff.
[20:20:28] <gwozniak> iDrougge: oof
[20:20:56] <iDrougge> gwozniak: That's a great way to attract talent, which explains a lot of the systems at the bank.

[21:03:58] <acegalla-> by avoiding people, I imagine

[21:04:41] <acegalla-> as for bizarrities, there's definitely some whiffing happening

[21:17:16] <q3k> rwb: the other way around - your scroll lock should emit a hearbeat like blink pattern, and the lower on memory you are, the slower the heartbeat is

[22:06:32] <technomancy> no; I stay the hell away from discord. I use slack in the browser sometimes for work but mostly I use wee-slack.
[22:07:01] <_rubik> TIL weeslack.
[22:07:19] <technomancy> it sucks at threads but then again so does the official client so ...
[22:07:19] <_rubik> Discord is a plague, I agree, but unfortunately a number of communities have migrated to it
[22:07:35] <technomancy> weechat might have a discord plugin too; never checked
[22:07:54] <technomancy> discord plugins have a tendency to go unmaintained when discord staff makes thinly veiled threats at the authors
[22:08:27] <_rubik> I would love to use weechat for everything, but I'm in the "slow friction is best", and when the work place uses emoji reactions / threads etc, I hop on board
[22:08:40] <_rubik> That's why a more feature rich GUI like Beeper is semi-appealing
[22:09:23] <technomancy> you can do threads in weeslack; they're just more annoying

[22:09:37] <technomancy> maybe emoji reacts too? I've never tried
[22:10:00] <_rubik> I'll give it a look -- thanks
[22:10:18] <technomancy> good luck =\
[22:11:59] <_rubik> Not sure there's a good answer here, unfortunately
[22:13:47] <gerikson> people who hate on discord should do less harping on "proprietary" and "centralized" and more work on actually making the alternatives better match discord's features
[22:14:00] <river> hah
[22:14:32] <technomancy> hey, I didn't even mention proprietary or centralized. it's dogshit for a wide variety of reasons.
[22:15:08] <gerikson> "how can you use this polished service that works on all devices and has an active developer when it's proprietary?!" <- every GNUfan
[22:15:16] <gerikson> technomancy: fair enough
[22:15:16] <pushcx> weeslack can do emoji but it's pretty clunky, yeah
[22:15:19] <river> just buy a wifi dongle
[22:15:20] <_rubik> I don't mind proprietary nor centralized, I just have having to monitor 18 networks/servers/workspaces across 3 apps
[22:15:24] <river> then you can use libre linux
[22:15:28] <technomancy> being run by jerks who make thinly veiled threats at client authors is a real big one tho
[22:15:39] <bkero> match what feature?
[22:15:56] <bkero> polished, lol. More like unassistive.
