[02:18:58] <brownorange> is propositional logic expressively complete? sure. but it does suffer from issues
[02:19:25] <Franciman> which are propagated to FOL too
[02:21:09] <brownorange> I think intuitionist wrongly react to L.E.M and !!A -> A,  because they didn't understand propositional logic.  they should have read the intent from the reality of the logic in their understanding and then they wouldn't be so bothered
[02:21:38] <brownorange> BUT, that said , propositional logic has serious issues with expressibility that aren't helping
[02:23:24] <brownorange> take any set of true facts, however unrelated, and insert them into a tautological formula. ask yourself if this was purely the user's fault that is possible. e
[02:24:00] <brownorange> similar take any mix of true and false facts, insert into a tautology.
[02:24:22] <wootehfoot> but sometimes intuitionist will say !!(!!A -> A) is easier to understand, expecting world to hunch down to the fictious complexity they've themselves created

[02:25:50] <Franciman> what you are referring to is usually called implication relevance, I think
[02:25:58] <Franciman> for example in classical logic
[02:26:00] <Franciman> you can prove
[02:26:07] <Franciman> p -> q \/ q -> p

[02:26:25] <Franciman> and that's even weirder
[02:26:39] <Franciman> it just means that -> is not a good representation of deduction
[02:26:53] <Franciman> otherwise independent propositions would not exist
[02:27:28] <Franciman> for example

[03:30:51] <biberao> why ?
[03:31:59] <buster> we have B/45 = A/60 = C/90 (one tooth = one tooth = one tooth), where A is the number of revolutions done by wheel A and so on. and then we put C=4.

[04:59:24] <qergle> Panther: ever make a wifi antenna from a pringles can?
[04:59:33] <johnkeats7> ppw, that's not quite right. the direction of the gradient determines the direction of greatest increase. the magnitude is the rate of change in that direction

[05:00:24] <johnkeats7> how the gradient itself varies is ultimately captured by the hessian, which gives you the quadratic terms in the polynomial approximation to your function
[05:00:26] <Panther> :)
[05:00:51] <johnkeats7> e.g. near a local extrema it can (in non-degenerate cases) determine whether you have a local minimum, maximum, or saddle
[05:01:09] <ppw> the Hessian? I thought it was the Fisher?
[05:01:13] <isekaijin> ppw: For a while I thought you were talking about the variance in statistics, so I was going to ask whether you meant the covariance matrix of a vector-valued random variable that happened to be the gradient of something else.
[05:01:29] <isekaijin> The Fisher information matrix is a Hessian matrix.

[06:39:32] <cuppajoeman> Proof (very sketch): https://imgur.com/4pfI5vN
[06:39:46] <cuppajoeman> And now I'll give the context for the matrix with at most 1 in columns
[06:40:57] <cuppajoeman> https://imgur.com/Fi2sWbt
[06:41:02] <qergle> ok, so the adjacency matrix
[06:41:24] <cuppajoeman> Yes my proof was for adjacency matrix
[06:41:26] <qergle> you put a 1 in the m,n position if there's an edge between vertex m & n
[06:41:32] <cuppajoeman> yeah
[06:41:47] <cuppajoeman> then there are n ^2 - n 1's in that matrix
[06:41:57] <qergle> at most
[06:42:06] *** Joins: Trashlord__ (~trash@user/trashlord)
[06:42:08] <cuppajoeman> because simple
[06:42:20] <cuppajoeman> And then each symeetric one across the diag is overcounting an edge
[06:42:51] <qergle> simple doesn't mean there's an edge between any two though,
[06:42:58] <cuppajoeman> No it doesn't
[06:43:09] <cuppajoeman> it just means the diagonal part of the matrix has to be zeros
[06:43:19] <qergle> sure, no loops
[06:43:35] <cuppajoeman> it seems to work then
[06:43:38] <qergle> i meant this: <cuppajoeman> then there are n ^2 - n 1's in that matrix
[06:44:37] <cuppajoeman> Are you asking me a question?
[06:44:50] <qergle> i am saying that's a max
[06:45:06] <qergle> you don't necessarily have that just for simpleness.
[06:45:16] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[06:45:23] <qergle> right?
[06:45:29] <cuppajoeman> Yes, because this matrix means it's complete
[06:45:51] <cuppajoeman> it's a complete graph
[06:45:53] <cuppajoeman> which is simple
[06:45:57] <qergle> yes
[06:45:59] <cuppajoeman> which is the most edges you can ever have
[06:46:07] <qergle> if it's simple + complete, then you'll have n^2-n 1's
[06:46:14] <cuppajoeman> at most
[06:46:15] <cuppajoeman> oh
[06:46:16] <cuppajoeman> yeah
[06:46:17] <cuppajoeman> equality
[06:46:18] <qergle> basially all 1s and subtract the n diagonals
[06:46:24] <cuppajoeman> yup
[06:46:33] <cuppajoeman> ok it makes sense
[06:47:01] *** Quits: sbrown (~sbrown@66.44.16.44) (Quit: Leaving…)
[06:47:05] <qergle> and here there's no direction so it must be symmetric
[06:47:17] <qergle> i.e. if u,v are joined by an edge v,u are.
[06:47:47] <qergle> say in a 10x10 matrix, entry 2,3 being 1 forces entry 3,2 to be 1 too.
[06:48:03] <cuppajoeman> got it
[06:48:40] <cuppajoeman> Im kinda excited to see if we can do matrix operations on graphs
[06:48:50] <cuppajoeman> and if it actually does useful things
[06:48:51] <qergle> you can!
[06:49:01] <qergle> someone here recently solved a nice problem that way
[06:49:57] <qergle> the problem was the following: using the digits 0,1,2,3,4, how many 10-digit sequences are there so that the difference between any consecutive digits is 1
[06:50:50] <qergle> one such sequence is 0123432101
[06:51:32] *** Joins: Carbonflux (~Carbonflu@c-24-56-228-141.customer.broadstripe.net)
[06:52:15] <somiaj> do you have to use all the digits? 0101010101
[06:52:24] <qergle> you don't have to use all difits
[06:52:35] <qergle> your sequence is part of the total, too
[06:54:06] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@2a0d:6fc2:4bb1:500:6b1e:2524:3d70:36ec)
[06:54:48] <cuppajoeman> 01010101 remind me of binary
[06:55:02] <cuppajoeman> and now I have a question about the collatz conjecture
[06:56:09] <cuppajoeman> The function is f(n) = { n/2 if n is even, 3n + 1 if n is odd  and the question is given any natural number > 0 after a finite number of applications of f to that number can you get to one right?
[06:56:24] <qergle> yes
[06:56:35] <cuppajoeman> If you ever get a power of two you would be done right?
[06:56:54] <qergle> a power of 2 is quick
[06:57:03] <qergle> you divide by 2 as many times as the power
[06:57:07] <cuppajoeman> Yeah
[06:57:13] <cuppajoeman> So I have this idea
[06:57:27] <cuppajoeman> instead of doing it for decimal numbers
[06:57:32] <cuppajoeman> what if we do it on binary numbers
[06:57:56] <qergle> bit shift for evens
[06:58:04] *** Mare is now known as Careful_I_Know_K
[06:58:05] <cuppajoeman> because for some binary number b, we have 3 b = 2 b + b = (b bitshifted left by one) + b
[06:58:14] *** Careful_I_Know_K is now known as Mare
[06:58:19] <cuppajoeman> does that make sense so far?
[06:58:40] <qergle> there's literature of doing collatz in binary
[06:58:45] <cuppajoeman> oh
[06:59:02] <qergle> in fact people have played with other bases too, not just base 2.
[06:59:27] <cuppajoeman> The thing I saw was with base 2 if you have a string like 101, 3 * (101)_2 + 1
[06:59:34] <cuppajoeman> gives a power of 2
[06:59:53] <cuppajoeman> Because if you bitshift 101 left by one and add it to 101 you get 1111
[07:00:05] <cuppajoeman> THen when you add one you get 10000
[07:01:00] <cuppajoeman> But also any string that has (01)^n (0)^k will always work too
[07:01:23] <cuppajoeman> (01)^n is 01 01 01 01 (n times)
[07:01:47] *** Quits: brownorange (~brownoran@user/brownorange) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:01:59] <cuppajoeman> I figured out in general which numbers produce strings of the form (01)^n (0)^k

[15:14:37] <CloudEvil> Hello! The fourier transform uses a series of sines to represent an arbitrary function. What is the analogous named function for a series of squarewaves.

[15:17:13] <CloudEvil> hi
[15:17:37] <twJizhan> uh, i feel down and low energy for hours, can someone give a nice fake proof to cheer me up?
[15:18:33] <Z-module> hi twJizhan
[15:18:46] <twJizhan> hi Z-module o/
[15:18:55] <Z-module> Hmm, you know the one showing that all pigs are yellow?
[15:19:20] <twJizhan> no or forgottern...
[15:20:44] <rindolf> CloudEvil: see https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits-and-bobs/square-waves-decomposition/
[15:21:03] <Z-module> Assertion: In every set of n pigs, all of them are yellow.  Induction on n:  For n = 0, it's clearly true vacuously. Assume true for n. Take some set S of n pigs. Now remove one (say pig p) from S, leaving behind n-1 pigs; by the inductive hypothesis, all of those are yellow; now replace p back in S and remove pig q (different from p); *these* n-1 are also all yellow. Thus the entire original set S of n pigs are all yellow. QED.
[15:21:22] <CloudEvil> rindolf: yes. I'm pretty sure tehre is an actual name for this.
[15:21:29] <Z-module> oops, I meant assume true for n-1
[15:21:39] <Z-module> I should have recast in terms of n+1 and n, same idea
[15:23:14] <twJizhan> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_horses_are_the_same_color ?
[15:23:48] <CloudEvil> The genetics of horse colour is neat.

[19:02:08] <lok91> (the Adams book)
[19:02:22] <quantum> That's not such a bad assumption to make since I would usually assume "function on a domain `R`" means "function defined at every point in a domain `R`"

[19:02:41] <quantum> but for something like Green's theorem, it might be worth restating

[19:02:54] <lok91> Oh
[19:03:22] <lok91> And if the vector field has to be defined on the region R enclosed by the curve C, it means that it must be defined at every point in R?

[19:37:07] <quantum> So take the filled in unit square
[19:37:17] <quantum> we'll first think about how to define the "inside" of it
[19:37:51] <isekaijin> So it seems that the problem here is that “boundary” has not been defined rigorously. Or, most likely, it has (in the book), but the definition is so finicky that lok91 failed to get the subtleties (not blaming you, btw).
[19:38:44] <lok91> Oh.
[19:38:50] <isekaijin> If you have a region R and a point P, we say that P is in the boundary of R if any ball centered at P, no matter how small, contains both points inside R and outside R.
[19:39:16] <lok91> That makes sense
[19:39:20] <isekaijin> Now check that the origin is in the boundary of your region R, in your example earlier.
[19:39:51] <quantum> it's worth pointing out that by a ball around a point `P`, we mean points strictly less than some distance `r` from `P`
[19:40:04] <isekaijin> Oh, yes, dang, thanks!

[19:40:24] <quantum> this definition doesn't work if your ball is points `Q` such that `dist(Q,P) <= r`
[19:40:46] <isekaijin> I should have said open ball.

[19:40:58] <quantum> idk if they know what open means
[19:41:04] <quantum> I was trying to avoid saying it
[19:41:21] <lok91> isekaijin I am not sure how to show that formally, but I guess it would hold.
[19:41:54] <isekaijin> Let e be a very small number.
[19:42:12] <isekaijin> And consider the disc { (x,y) \in R^2 : x^2 + y^2 < e^2 }
[19:42:22] <isekaijin> This is a so-called “open disc” centered at the origin.
[19:42:24] <lok91> Yes
[19:42:44] <isekaijin> Now check that this disc contains a point outside of R (which one?) and lots of points inside of R.
[19:43:47] <lok91> Hm... does "check" mean "prove" here?
[19:44:01] <isekaijin> Yes, but the “proof” is just a simple calculation.
[19:44:05] <lok91> I'm not sure how to construct a formal proof.
[19:44:11] <lok91> What would it take?
[19:44:27] <isekaijin> You need to find a point in the disc where the vector field is not defined.

[19:44:42] <cherim> Fantastic!
[19:44:45] <lok91> :P
[19:44:47] <isekaijin> So the disc, no matter how small, contains a point where the vector field is not defined.
[19:44:55] <lok91> Yes
[19:45:01] <isekaijin> But it also contains points where the vector field is defined.
[19:45:13] <isekaijin> (Again, no matter how small the disc is.)
[19:45:14] <lok91> I see
[19:45:18] <lok91> There is a bunch of those
[19:45:21] <isekaijin> Right.

[19:52:14] <isekaijin> The tangent cones at the origin are quite different.
[19:52:27] <isekaijin> For a singularity of type A, it is the union of two distinct planes.
[19:52:40] <isekaijin> For a singularity of type D, it is a single plane with multiplicity 2.
[19:53:20] <isekaijin> And it is obvious from the polynomials that define the singularities, so it is not like it was something super subtle.

[20:39:58] <Koen> are you trying to prove that there exists a natural number b such that n(n+1)+1 is prime?

[21:52:20] <lok91> And that's a problem?
[21:52:28] <dude12312414> Green's theorem does hold for regions with holes, but then you need to include all boundaries

[22:14:05] <lok91> Or... well. My boundary would change.
[22:14:20] <cherim> Now, you can regard one point as a hole. But then add a proper term to C
[22:15:11] <cherim> Your definition explicitly says "C consists of one or more piecewise smooth..."
[22:15:23] <cherim> This is when you need "or more"
[22:15:40] <cherim> And the theorem is applicable again
[22:16:05] <lok91> If we change C, yes? :D
[22:16:07] <lok91> So that "proper term" has something to do with (0,0)?
[22:16:28] <lok91> I guess a term cannot be a point though.
[22:16:45] <cherim> That proper term has to do with making F a smooth vector field in R
[22:17:20] <cherim> Throw away a small disk of radius r centered at the origin, add its boundary C1 to C

[22:17:45] <cherim> In the annulus between that disk and the boundary of the square F is perfectly OK

[22:19:40] <qergle> why they would do such a thing is not comprehensible to me
[22:20:23] <cherim> If R={(x, y) : x^2+y^2>=r^2 and |x|<=2 and |y|<=2}, your original F is OK

[22:24:31] <cuppajoeman> Yeah I get it

[22:26:29] <lok91> So far, so good. I think I understand that. But didn't you just say "It's not about smoothness even"?
[22:26:46] <lok91> Your argument here is "because F is not smooth in such R"?
[22:26:54] <lok91> But you say it is not about smoothness?

[22:27:24] <cuppajoeman> http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/mikevans/jeffrosenthal/
[22:27:28] <lok91> But the problem here *IS* the smoothness of the vector field on R?

[22:27:38] <cuppajoeman> qergle: I added toc to it because there was no good way to navigate the book

[22:44:27] <isekaijin> This means that, in polar coordinates, C admits a parametrization of the form r = r(\theta).

[22:53:38] <isekaijin> On a first sight, it seems like a concept that is specific to the software you are using.
[22:57:00] <isekaijin> Do nef polyhedra have something to do with nef line bundles?
[22:57:27] <peepsalot> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nef_polygon
[22:57:40] <isekaijin> Oh, so totally unrelated.
[22:57:51] <isekaijin> Nef is even a last name in the case of Nef polyhedra.
[22:57:58] <peepsalot> haven't heard of bundles, its all about half-spaces

[23:00:55] <peepsalot> for whatever reason, 2D Nef in CGAL requires an "extended geometry" kernel, but 3D Nef does not.
[23:01:35] <isekaijin> Software design has its own considerations.

[23:21:43] <anovick> Hey guys, is it true that every invertible matrix is similar to the identity matrix? this seems false because I have matrix M = [[1,0],[2,1]] over real field, which has single eigenvalue x = 1 with algebraic multiplicity of 2 and geometric multiplicity of 1, so matrix M is not diagonalisable and therefore M is not similar to identity matrix
[23:22:21] <Z-module> no, [1,1; 0,1] is invertible but is its own Jordan form which is not that of the identity.

[23:23:00] <anovick> Z-module: cherim: ok, thank you!!
[23:23:01] <Z-module> more trivially, [2,0; 0,2] is invertible and diagonal. Not similar to [1,0; 0,1].
[23:23:11] <anovick> wow
[23:24:53] <Z-module> Math people are partitioned into two distinct types: Those who perfer their Jordan blocks to have the superdiagonal 1's above the diagonal; and those ... below the diagonal.
[23:25:19] <anovick> Z-module: umm I think when you talk about Jordan form then having different Jordan form of that [1,1; 0,1] matrix compared to identity matrix then that invalidates only that the two matrices are congruent
[23:25:28] <Z-module> I'm *relatively* sure that most books and teachers prefer the above-diagonal version.
[23:25:51] <qergle> well, you can permute the jordan blocks, but this is hardly the easiest invariant
[23:26:03] <qergle> similar matrices share determinants, for example.

[23:27:35] *** Quits: seninha_ (~seninha@user/seninha) (Client Quit)
[23:27:56] <anovick> qergle: det(B) = det(M^T * A * M) = det(M^T)*det(A)*det(M)= det(M)^2 * det(A)
[23:28:07] <qergle> now now
[23:28:22] <qergle> let's be careful before making wrong claims
[23:28:48] <Z-module> most people define A, B similar without referring to the transpose of something
[23:28:51] <anovick> qergle: for your question B is similar to A if there is regular matrix M such that B = M^T A M
[23:28:52] <riv> it's not M^T
[23:28:58] <anovick> oops not M^T
[23:29:03] <anovick> riv: thanks for correction
[23:29:06] <riv> A is similar to B if there is an invertible matrix M, A = M^(-1) B M
[23:29:13] <anovick> I was confused with congruence
[23:29:16] <riv> note, det(M^(-1)) = 1/det(M)
[23:29:20] <qergle> now do your determinant decomposition with M⁻¹
[23:29:28] <Z-module> yes, i.e. A, B are conjugate to each other in the matrix ring
[23:30:28] <qergle> and you will no longer get (det(M))² in there. and you'll confirm to yourself my comment from before.
[23:30:29] <anovick> riv: yes, also det(AB) = det(A)detB so det(A^-1)det(A) = det(A^-1 A) = det(I)=1
[23:30:46] <riv> that looks wrong
[23:30:58] <riv> just tweak what you wrote earlier a little
[23:31:11] <riv> det(B) = det(M^(-1) * A * M) = det(M^(-1))*det(A)*det(M)= det(A)
[23:31:18] <anovick> yes
[23:31:33] <cuppajoeman> Can someone share an example of a random variable on a sample space who's image is all of R?
[23:31:36] <qergle> and it's proved. determinant is invariant.
[23:31:46] <cherim> And M^{-1} I M = I so nothing else is similar to I...
[23:32:09] <anovick> cherim: what do you mean?
[23:32:25] <cherim> Only the identity matrix is similar to identity matrix

[23:33:18] <anovick> qergle: exactly the calculation I made
[23:33:27] <Z-module> yeah, and doesn't need the scalar field to be algebraically closed
[23:34:08] <anovick> cherim: very good I like your conclusion. only matrix similar to I is I
