[00:45:41] <Brekkjern> Bleh. This problem is annoying to figure out :(
[00:48:29] <gerikson> today in #techrights: enemies of Free Software are literal Nazis
[00:48:59] <gerikson> (basically IBM helped the Nazis do the Holocaust, and now they are critical of RMS - Q.E.D.)
[00:49:15] <gerikson> atleast this person doesn't *deny* the Holocaust happened
[00:52:49] <dimadima> techrights has been difficult to keep up with but so far i've enjoyed "shithub" instead of github
[00:53:57] <mouseghost> whats that techrights thing?
[00:54:13] <gerikson> mouseghost: it's a place where fanatical people hang out
[00:54:19] <mouseghost> ah
[00:54:28] <dimadima> fanatiques
[00:55:17] <dimadima> good day mouseghost
[00:55:29] <mouseghost> hello dimadima
[00:55:34] <mouseghost> its almost goodnight, though
[00:56:25] <dimadima> almost good night then!
[00:56:28] <dimadima> bon soir!
[00:57:59] <mouseghost> hm, i dont speak french
[00:58:04] <dimadima> me neither!
[00:58:27] <dimadima> i speak english, american, and russian
[00:59:45] <dimadima> ;)
[01:00:06] <indigo> Привет, Дима!
[01:01:04] <dimadima> Привет indigo :)
[01:01:17] <mouseghost> whats the difference between english and american?
[01:01:36] <dimadima> mouseghost: not much i think, i was just joking
[01:01:40] <mouseghost> ah
[01:01:45] <dimadima> a friend of mine once said that i thought it was pretty funny
[01:01:45] <mouseghost> dimadima, are you in .ru?
[01:01:57] <dimadima> nope i'm in eastern USA, maryland
[01:02:03] <dimadima> .com
[01:02:03] <mouseghost> oh
[01:02:04] <dimadima> lolol
[01:02:18] <mouseghost> isnt there .us
[01:02:36] <dimadima> there is i guess heh
[01:02:38] <mouseghost> and is indigo in .ru
[01:02:50] <indigo> Nope; I'm in Los Angeles
[01:03:08] <mouseghost> hhm
[01:05:20] <dimadima> do you speak russian indigo
[01:06:15] <indigo> Only a little. I came to the states when I was five

[01:07:06] <dimadima> i was 4 and a half :)
[01:07:42] <indigo> Oh cool!
[01:08:03] <dimadima> probably similar experiences if you're born around the mid-80s
[01:08:22] <dimadima> although growing up in california (if you did) must have been a bit different
[01:09:26] <dimadima> most russian ppl of this era that i know moved to new york, though. i'm glad i didn't grow up in new york
[01:09:49] <dimadima> though, maybe it would have been cool. who knows
[01:09:58] <indigo> I think New York is pretty cool
[01:10:00] <gerikson> NYC seems amazing
[01:10:11] <gerikson> I'd prefer it to LA/California
[01:10:21] <mouseghost> goodnight
[01:10:26] <indigo> I was born in '90 though, so maybe a little different
[01:10:35] <indigo> gerikson: The weather, man!
[01:10:37] <mouseghost> i think ill stay in EU and will visit US when ill be rich enough ;v

[01:11:14] <dimadima> new york is amazing but it would have been rough growing up there in the 90s as an immigrant
[01:11:21] <dimadima> or, really, as anyone, imo
[01:11:35] <gerikson> although I have read someoene who said that if the US had been settled from the West Coast the Northeast would be nothing but alfalfa farms now
[01:12:34] <dimadima> and west coast would be all stock exchanges and hustle
[01:13:18] <dimadima> i really enjoyed the west coast, california
[01:13:41] <dimadima> southern, in particular. bay area, not so much
[01:13:48] <dimadima> though it was cool too
[01:14:21] <gerikson> dimadima: ah ok
[01:14:26] <gerikson> can't comment on that
[01:14:37] <dimadima> about what
[01:15:39] <indigo> gerikson: Fucking Sweden!!!!!!!
[01:15:56] <indigo> Jkjk, I love Sweden. Land of Elektron and Kanelbullar
[01:16:06] <dimadima> yeah sweden is a must see place
[01:16:21] <dimadima> i had a math professor who was from sweden and really sold it for me
[01:17:18] <dimadima> wore this thing all the time and was really into pagan culture http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/Gallery/KnottedObjects/StaubachsWhitehead.html

[01:18:17] <gerikson> lol taht's not that mainstream
[01:18:26] <gerikson> most Swedes are irreligious
[01:18:38] <dimadima> i think he was mostly trolling but there was a bit of seriousness to it
[01:18:41] <gerikson> dimadima: can't comment on being an immigrant
[01:19:31] <dimadima> ah yes. well my parents did it, i was mostly just along for the ride
[01:22:13] <dimadima> but fwiw i added the "as anyone really" because growing up in new york as anyone seems rough. my sister has a friend, his parents lived in the living room and he got the lone bedroom
[01:22:36] <dimadima> or maybe it was the other way around. or maybe someone literally even lived in the kitchen
[01:22:48] <Brekkjern> Sweden is shit. Kind regards, Norway.
[01:22:56] <dimadima> and they weren't poor, the parents just really wanted to live in manhattan and they weren't rich
[01:23:03] <dimadima> hahaha Brekkjern
[01:24:02] <goodger> norway is shit – with deepest sympathies, netherlands
[01:24:51] <dimadima> if europe didn't have soccer would all the 100 year wars just resume the next dar?

[01:24:59] <dimadima> ahem, sorry, football
[01:25:02] <gerikson> Norway is great - everytime I consider the taxes in Sweden I remember they're even higher in Norway
[01:25:13] <gerikson> also way more Musk-ites

[02:18:35] <ngoldbaum> that can work but it can easily verge into unpaid labor territory
[02:18:46] <ngoldbaum> shouldn’t be more than an hour or two of work
[02:19:51] <ngoldbaum> i have zero experience with it but find the idea of paying interviewees for five hours or whatever as contractors aligns incentives better

[18:38:57] <dimadima> rob monster was quoted on wikipedia yesterday calling it "nothinburgers" a term which in my mind instantly signals the opposite
[18:39:29] <dimadima> or quite possibly he was pretty ignorant at the time (which would reflect their infra) and didn't know

[18:42:40] <ngoldbaum> the fbi really fucked up the 2016 election
[18:42:47] <ngoldbaum> also anthony weiner smh

[18:44:28] <dimadima> also, anthony weiner?
[18:45:14] * dimadima looked up why George Conway used that term and yeah it was actually nothingburgers heh
[18:45:28] <dimadima> (i didnt even remember why he had said it in the first place)
[18:46:03] <ngoldbaum> there’s a decent argument that trump only won because the fbi did that press conference like two weeks before the election and made hillary look like a criminal
[18:52:09] <dimadima> oh yeah that gosh i forget everything
[18:52:25] <dimadima> and anthony weiner how did i forget all that??
[18:53:12] <dimadima> whenever i think anthony weiner now i think how he could have been mayor of NY and instead failed to keep away from children and we got deblasio instead

[19:54:58] <manicennui> Brutal.
[20:02:13] * manicennui remembers how great Radiohead is.
[20:05:31] * dimadima is not here, this isn't happening
[20:16:42] <gwozniak> Don't be such a paranoid android
[20:20:08] <indigo> manicennui: Lol, pretty sure most companies that did drug tests are still doing drug tests, especially in the medical field
[20:21:23] <manicennui> I'm not paranoid. I don't even use drugs.
[20:21:35] <indigo> You can still fail drug tests even if you don't use recreational drugs :)
[20:21:39] <manicennui> I refuse to work for companies that drug test before employment.
[20:21:55] <indigo> That's great, but others may not be as lucky
[20:21:55] <manicennui> The War on Drugs is one of the worst things we have done in the last 50 years.
[20:22:00] <manicennui> Sure.
[20:22:25] <indigo> My wife failed a series of drug tests because her doctor put her on a new medication
[20:22:28] <manicennui> Many of us with privilege can refuse to do it and cause companies to change policies.
[20:23:48] <manicennui> Can't help everyone, but we can have an impact.
[20:26:18] <prussian> ^
[20:26:19] <prussian> same
[20:26:33] <prussian> drug testing was fading where I was before this corona stuff though.
[20:27:06] <prussian> I have refused all sorts of stupid interview/jobs for all sorts of dumb reasons.
[20:30:29] <indigo> I should only apply to places that don't do whiteboard interviews
[20:31:56] <manicennui> I have never done a whiteboard interview.
[20:33:06] <indigo> Good! Seems to be more popular at FAANG + west coast
[20:33:50] <prussian> it only bothers me if they actually expect code that runs.
[20:34:09] <prussian> or have some really really deconstructionist attitude to the whole process.
[20:36:23] <indigo> IMO it selects for those that don't question requirements much :)
[20:36:42] <indigo> Speaking of wild requirements, how is your BST problem going Brekkjern
[20:41:25] <manicennui> I'm not totally opposed to brainstorming a design or something on a whiteboard.
[20:41:36] <manicennui> I'm not going to perform an algorithms and data structure test.
[20:42:25] <indigo> Yeah, I keep a notepad by my desk for brainstorming purposes
[20:45:03] <indigo> Rhodia pads are pretty great :)
[20:46:13] <manicennui> I need to fix my work habits.
[20:46:27] <manicennui> I feel like my current job is causing me to be a bad employee.
[20:46:34] <manicennui> But it is also kind of what they want.
[20:47:41] <indigo> What's wrong with your work habits?
[20:47:51] <manicennui> I spend most of my time in meetings talking about work.
[20:48:31] <manicennui> I work on a huge legacy system that never in its history had a good design. It was built over ~12 years and every single project has been done in the most expedient way possible.
[20:49:07] <manicennui> So most of what I do is attempt to reason about this system with no real design to figure out why the latest problem is happening, or how to cram some more functionality into it.
[20:49:28] <manicennui> Basically people want me to keep large chunks of the system in my head because I can.
[20:49:48] <manicennui> Which is really exhausting.
[20:50:00] <manicennui> So I don't work hard in the couple hours per day I have to actually write code.
[20:51:59] <indigo> Always exhausting having to be the expert
[20:52:24] <manicennui> Everyone seems fine with the fact that I get very little actual work done though.
[20:52:41] <manicennui> I make sure my team gets things done.
[20:53:46] <manicennui> Unfortunately I can see that one of our fresh grads is going down the same path. He is way more skilled than the others, and is already becoming the expert in one area.
[20:54:10] <manicennui> He claims to like it, but I fear that he will eventually become burnt out like I am.
[20:54:28] <manicennui> The only thing saving this place is the fact that our work/life balance is so good.
[20:56:43] <indigo> It's surprising how much mental load all of those questions take
[20:57:34] <manicennui> Yeah.
[21:19:36] <indigo> I wonder if this is part of why software engineers switch jobs every two years :P
[21:22:56] <manicennui> I actually like knowing the business and product really well.
[21:23:10] <manicennui> I just wish that I could just once work somewhere where the code isn't a trash fire.
[21:28:21] <indigo> There's nowhere where the code isn't a trash fire :P
[21:34:42] <manicennui> Yeah, that is kind of what I assume.
[21:34:52] <manicennui> I assume there are places where it is quite a bit better though.
[21:41:52] <pja> Taking eldest to university tomorrow. Weird feeling!

[22:26:02] <bkero> Seriously, changing the font in Discord means you have to either use the console to modify the electron app, or the same in the browser. If they catch you doing it, can be an immediate ban.
[22:27:36] <gerikson> :(
[22:28:45] <bkero> or, in my case, using bitlbee
[22:28:54] <bkero> They also ban for third party clients
[22:29:26] <ngoldbaum> whose company uses discord for internal chat?
[22:29:36] <ngoldbaum> that’s a first for me
[22:29:47] <manicennui> It's voice chat is probably way, way, way better than Slack's.
[22:29:52] <manicennui> Its
[22:30:01] <bkero> We used it as a backup chat platform at Brave.
[22:30:06] <bkero> when Slack would go down
[22:30:23] <manicennui> Slack being down is a chance to do work.
[22:31:05] <bkero> Indeed
[22:31:26] <bkero> But when you're an SRE and all your work is reactionary and comes through Slack
[22:31:30] <bkero> Time to fuck off to the pub

[23:40:53] <manicennui> I just don't understand the prudish attitude of a lot of progressives now.
[23:41:46] <manicennui> And there seems to be a general thought that women under like 30 don't have their own agency when it comes to sex and relationships.

[23:53:59] <riv> I enjoyed micro men very much
[23:54:32] <pja> From a 2020s perspective, what hurts is how undercapitalised the UK computer industry was - once the behemoths of the US rolled in it was inevitably going to be squashed.
[23:54:54] <pja> I remember reading somewhere how difficult Acorn found it to raise capital, even with the BBC backing in their pocket.
