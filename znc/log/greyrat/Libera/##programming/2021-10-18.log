[02:49:39] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Hi, I've got an issue with a flood fill algorithm overflowing the stack.
[02:49:40] <Thedarkb-Desktop> https://dpaste.com/7X98JAEZM
[02:50:16] <Thedarkb-Desktop> CHUNKSIZE is the boundary of the image, field is the pixel that's being replaced and id is the pixel it's being replaced with.

[02:51:11] <jacekowski> well, that is to be expected
[02:51:24] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I know I've missed something obvious.
[02:51:25] <jacekowski> bigger stack or change algorithm 
[02:51:36] <Thedarkb-Desktop> That shouldn't be the issue.
[02:51:43] <jacekowski> you are calling fill from within fill 
[02:51:56] <Thedarkb-Desktop> That's how recursion works.
[02:52:02] <jacekowski> yes
[02:52:08] <jacekowski> and that is how you end up with stack overflows
[02:52:32] <jacekowski> every call is consuming few bytes of your stack
[02:52:41] *** Quits: Auron (~Auron956@user/auron) (Remote host closed the connection)

[05:15:04] <Decker> well at some point of deleting things you start deleting things in use
[05:15:09] <Decker> so I don't know how much you're deleting
[05:15:44] <Decker> there is also that things that happens where you have another command prompt in a directory and delete that directroy - it can end up showing there, but it's really not
[05:15:55] <Decker> you can't make a new one, you can't go into or delete the old one- a reboot fixes that

[07:18:13] <fromtheshu> Well i don't get it..,it seems playing with sox even if spawned before record doesn't exit as fast as record can record for the exact lenght + delay in sequentially calling record after splaying + doing a convert output file format with another sox instance... its locking the input file and wont lemme delete when it's 44khz but not when 11khz
[07:18:42] <fromtheshu> And for some reason cmd wont launch wait or choice now.
[07:18:57] <fromtheshu> So I can't put in a super long delay...
[07:19:46] <fromtheshu> Idk why, I wanna know why sox isnt exiting after playing the file as fast as lower sample fq

[10:40:48] <arahael> smallvil_: This is the same community where *Gopher* is still popular.
[10:41:16] <smallvil_> is it basically like a client for a server based html renderer?
[10:41:22] <arahael> vdamewood: That file does indeed look suspicious, does it follow any obvious conventions that a cmake-based ios project might use?
[10:41:29] <smallvil_> eg the server provides stuff for the client to render
[10:41:43] <arahael> smallvil_: html is fat, Gemini is much lighter.
[10:41:51] <smallvil_> then yes

I'm writing a small HTTP microservice to modify configs of systemd units and restart them. using express and dbus-next. you submit a "restartunit" on the bus and get back a job id, and then you get an event emitted when it completes. I want my HTTP call to block until the job completes, so I'm trying to work out how that route handler should be told that a particular job has finished

[13:42:44] <pyzozord> oh ok sorry
[13:43:05] <pyzozord> I thought "ssh tunnel" means "ssh connection - aka secure shell connection"
[13:43:31] <vdamewood> It does, but only if you're transporting a network protocol over ssh, which this isn't.
[13:43:33] <mawk> ah no, ssh tunnel is a feature of ssh that forwards a local port to the remote host; or the reverse
[13:43:49] <pyzozord> oh right right
[13:43:56] <mawk> you can even make a tun/tap "vpn" be transported by ssh
[13:44:12] <pyzozord> so it's kind of "ssh tunnel means some other protocol piggybacks on top of ssh"
[13:44:20] <pulse> it's like a normal tunnel, except everything is green with morphing matrix symbols texture
[13:44:35] <mawk> yes I guess pyzozord 
[13:44:39] <vdamewood> For example, X uses a network protocol for programs to communicate with the 'server' (the thing that renders to the screen). You can transport that protocol over SSH to display windows on your local screen that are running on the remote machine.

[13:45:18] <pyzozord> how does such transporting look like btw?
[13:45:48] <mawk> ssh gets every ip frame and encapsulates it into a homemade protocol, transports it over the ssh connection, and de-encapsulates it on the other side
[13:45:54] <pyzozord> I imagine computer secure shells to another computer. Then it's in that computers shell and then what? It starts echoing stuff and piping that somewhere?

[13:46:22] <mawk> no pyzozord the shell is just one thing ssh can transport
[13:46:31] <mawk> instead of transporting the shell it can transport raw data

[13:46:38] <pyzozord> ok I see
[13:46:48] <mawk> yes git will use this pipe thing
[13:47:07] <pyzozord> that's cool
[13:47:24] <pyzozord> then out of curiosity how does the shell part of ssh work then?
[13:47:45] <pyzozord> shouldn't just be telnet transported over secure ssh protocol?
[13:47:46] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Because of this, you can add additional protocols and handlers to your sshd config.
[13:48:00] <vdamewood> It basically is that.
[13:48:02] <mawk> it transports every key press and character update of the terminal screen
[13:48:05] <smallville7123> 3D occlusion culling typically involves a top down heirarchy (eg closest to farthest) since objects that are rendered closer can occlude objects that are rendered further, right?
[13:48:07] <mawk> using a virtual terminal screen with a given size
[13:48:20] <pyzozord> I heard that ssh and telnet are actually completely different, and ssh is not just "telnet over ssh"

[13:48:52] <mawk> I'm  not sure telnet is that different pyzozord 
[13:49:19] <mawk> but yeah ssh is "linux terminal" over a secure connection, and telnet is their own flavor of terminal with their own key bindings
[13:49:27] <pyzozord> but you can't literally transport telnet over ssh and expect it to connect and work

[13:54:19] <mawk> yes
[13:54:33] <arahael> pyzozord: For ssh, it's always tcp. If you want udp, consider using mosh, but mosh will still need the initial tcp connection to set everything up.

[13:59:00] <pulse> ugh cmake. /me runs away
[13:59:04] <mawk> and all special events are transmitted in-band using control codes
[13:59:24] *** Quits: inky_ (~inky@178.78.158.18) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[13:59:25] <mawk> as a result you can mostly use telnet interchangeably with netcat
[13:59:30] <arahael> vdamewood: Ah.  iOS is much... Simpler, by contrast.
[13:59:41] <pyzozord> mawk: I don't understand. How is that different form what ssh does? (except that ssh encrypts the data)
[13:59:44] <vdamewood> arahael: Static build. NEXT!
[13:59:46] <mawk> since it uses one simple socket and no authentication of any sort
[14:00:02] <Decker> ssh also has 'channels'  
[14:00:08] <Decker> though they're not a highly used feature
[14:00:09] <arahael> vdamewood: Ha.  As if iOS devs all know what a static build is!
[14:00:13] <mawk> ssh encrypts the data yes pyzozord , then has its own protocol to transmit and receive frames on each channel
[14:00:25] <arahael> vdamewood: Have you looked at IPATH and LPATH?
[14:00:31] <mawk> you have channel for the pty data, and also for the port forwarding
[14:00:36] * arahael wonders if there's a ZPATH as well, there's so many of them.
[14:00:45] <vdamewood> arahael: Uh, No. Never had to.
[14:00:47] <mawk> you can have both a ssh shell and port forwarding on the same connection
[14:00:54] <mawk> or multiple shells on the same connection
[14:00:58] <vdamewood> arahael: FWIW, RPATH is also a thing on Linux.
[14:01:03] <mawk> see the talk about "master socket" in the ssh doc
[14:01:05] <arahael> vdamewood: Oh?
[14:02:07] <pyzozord> mawk: oh so telnet is simpler it literally just client sends raw pty events to the server, server receives these events and writes them to the pty
[14:02:14] <vdamewood> arahael: Yeah, it's a way to embed search locations into a binary for libraries.
[14:02:24] <pulse> i used cmake once. that's the end of the story, i only used cmake once
[14:02:47] <pyzozord> while ssh is more complex, it has channels, multiple different things can be transfered at the same time, multiple terminals... It's like ssh has whole another network layer and telnet does not
[14:02:49] <arahael> vdamewood: In nix, they patch the path to the dynamic loader directly, instead.  It's crazy.
[14:02:51] <mawk> yes pyzozord except it's not even a pty with telnet, it just receives and sends characters
[14:02:58] <pyzozord> ah!
[14:03:10] <pyzozord> wait
[14:03:12] <mawk> but a pty is very close to being a raw character stream, interpretation of the control codes is mostly up to the terminal software
[14:03:20] <vdamewood> arahael: so if you add "@executable_path/../Frameworks" to your app's executable, it can find libraries in that directory.
[14:03:21] *** Joins: inky_ (~inky@178.78.158.18)
[14:03:29] <mawk> except for a few special codes like ^C and so on interpreted by the kernel
[14:03:37] <vdamewood> arahael: Linux uses $origin instead of @executable_path, but same Idea.
[14:04:06] <pyzozord> mawk: so how does telnet allow me to talk to remote shell if it just transfers a stream of strings?
[14:04:16] *** Joins: kts_ (~kts@103.73.237.230)

[14:04:34] <mawk> there is a telnet server on the other side that pipes what it receives into a shell pyzozord 
[14:04:34] <arahael> vdamewood: Remind me, you can only set one RPATH?
[14:04:55] <vdamewood> or @executable_path/../Frameworks/Foo.framework/Foo <-- or whatever.
[14:04:59] <vdamewood> arahael I don't know.
[14:05:02] <mawk> and interpreting the special characters as they appear in the stream

[14:05:38] <pyzozord> nice!
[14:05:43] <pyzozord> thanks so much, I learned new things
[14:05:53] <mawk> ssh does some interpretation on the raw stream though
[14:06:01] <mawk> it has a few special tricks
[14:06:04] <mawk> but it's not important
[14:06:25] <mawk> mainly you can do <enter>~. to force kill a ssh session
[14:06:38] <mawk> it's done client side though so it doesn't really count

[14:06:50] <mawk> yeah
[14:08:02] <vdamewood> arahael: Looks like 2 RPATH's are fine.
[14:08:07] <mawk> then to create the pty devices you just ask linux to make a master/slave pair
[14:08:25] <arahael> vdamewood: Nice.
[14:08:27] <mawk> when you type into the terminal all characters you type are read by ssh from the master end
[14:08:51] <mawk> then written into the master end on the remote side, and the shell program connected to the remote slave end receive them
[14:08:54] <vdamewood> arahael: And like I said, you can also set the install name on a per library basis, so you can say "this specific library is in the foo directory"

[14:09:57] <mrig> Oh Casey's latest video is great, nice to hear his metrics for what constitutes optimisation, non pessimisation seems like a great way to describe what I tend to call, as a learner, looking for a sane base line.
[14:10:11] <arahael> vdamewood: This is where you bundle-bundle-bundle?
[14:10:14] <vdamewood> arahael: It lets you do things like say "My libraries are in the Frameworks" directory if this bundle, for example. Instead of having to install a bunch of individuql Frameworks in the /Frameowkr dir.
[14:10:34] <vdamewood> Those quotes are in the wrong place.
[14:10:35] <pyzozord> mrig: yes, I'm already looking forward to the rest of the series
[14:10:48] <mawk> yes it's a file descriptor pyzozord 
[14:10:50] <arahael> vdamewood: Nice, and you can include those bundles within your current bundle, I expect.
[14:10:53] <mawk> you can read and write from it
[14:11:06] <vdamewood> arahael: Framework bundles? Yes.
[14:11:07] <mrig> getting told that optimisation is the root of all evil when you are simply trying to avoid doing something that is obviously an excuse for not doing something that is silly, is a curious place to be in.
[14:11:32] <pulse> mrig, i find that to be a huge fallacy
[14:11:40] <pulse> i optimize early, always
[14:11:47] <vdamewood> arahael: So if you have a framework called Foo.framework, and an app that uses it called Bar.app, then you can have Bar.app/Contents/Frameworks/Foo.framework

[14:15:57] <pulse> and DRY. of course those should be ingrained deep in your subconscious anyway
[14:16:30] <pulse> premature optimization one just makes me laugh tbh
[14:16:30] <mrig> to take a bit of a short cut in gaining some valuable experience, even if it is a lot of work to do.

[14:16:48] <pulse> any real engineer knows you optimize as early as humanly possible, or risk a complete disaster later on
[14:16:55] <pulse> pyzozord, yeah agreed
[14:17:15] <pulse> the point is to optimize smart though. wishy washy optimization isn't what i'm talking about

[14:23:48] <pyzozord> Here is the full quote "The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming."
[14:23:57] <pyzozord> I think that first sentence is crucial
[14:24:05] <pulse> yeah but that statement can be interpreted in two ways
[14:24:18] <pulse> one of which is intelligent and the other is repeated by low skilled programmers who have no idea what it means
[14:24:56] <pulse> any statement can be like that. i could say "optimize early" and there's 2 polar ways of interpreting that
[14:24:57] <pyzozord> also this "Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up 
[14:25:03] <pyzozord> our opportunities in that critical 3%."
[14:25:06] <pyzozord> (from here http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization)
[14:25:29] <pyzozord> which is I guess what we said here, you must optimize but you must also know what to optimize and when

[17:50:06] <Teckla> mishugana: Ah, I see.  Yeah, traction is defined pretty subjectively here.  I guess I'd say languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and Go have "traction."

[17:50:14] <Teckla> That's not an exhaustive list, or anything.

[17:59:41] <mishugana> I love Rust's pattern matching capabilities, which are even stronger than Haskell's (in my experience), but the language has become even more complex than C++ already

[18:22:24] <Inst_> cout, cin, calculate, cout
[18:23:10] <Inst_> what i want to do is, one, do it functionally, i.e, have cin + error-checking be in one function that loops to itself, and have that function be an argument for the calculate + cout part
[18:23:23] <mrig> There is quite a strong JS influence on go, with the use of anonymous functions and enclosures.
[18:23:32] <sonny> nope
[18:23:39] <Inst_> without using for/while loops, i'd rather do it as recursion
[18:24:02] <Inst_> if the error checking is wrong, it calls the cin + error-checking function to try it again
[18:24:13] <sonny> mostly by oberon and C as said by griesmer
[18:24:29] <sonny> the enclosures tho, not sure why

[18:42:29] <Inst_> vdamewood:
[18:42:32] <Inst_> it's more like optional
[18:42:46] <Inst_> i can do this very easily in an imperative style, and the textbook is expecting it to be done imperatively
[18:42:49] <mrig> Likely due to Gresiners input I should imagine, as he did write the V8 engine, so must be a bit of a JS aficionado. Right yes closures, and enclosure is a good description still, somehow though.
[18:42:54] <pyzozord> like everything else in CS, looks like it started in 1960s in lisp
[18:43:16] <Inst_> bleh, whatever
[18:43:25] <Inst_> i have a haskell textbook, maybe i'll give up on C++ for now and learn Haskell instead
[18:43:42] <vdamewood> Inst_: Well, in that case, functioal programming rarely involves things like cout.
[18:44:05] <pyzozord> mrig: to be perfectly nerdy and annoying about it, v8 is not the first javascript language, it didn't really contribute to the language much, other than making it much much faster than it was before
[18:44:07] <mrig> haskell and C++ are very different beasts, what is it that you want to program?
[18:44:27] <pyzozord> s/v8 is not the first javascript language/v8 is not the first javascript engine/
[18:44:48] <mrig> pyzozord: oh sure yes, but the author of V8 being one of the authors of golang was my point.
[18:45:07] <pyzozord> oh really? Need to look up this name
[18:45:12] <mrig> also an author of a java jit compiler, I think for sun but am not sure.
[18:45:26] <pyzozord> yeah could be that go was influenced by javascript because of him then
[18:46:09] <mrig> the introductions of some of the element are likely from his input, he says as much in this video if memory serves...

[18:49:02] <Inst_> like, say I pass the function to another function that has an argument where i can insert the loop and avoid using for / while
[18:49:15] <mrig> pyzozord: it is a really powerful feature of Go but really does take some getting used too, means that you are using the decorator pattern alot, and as stated in the GOF design patterns book, this can be really tricky to reason about.
[18:49:34] <mrig> I think it could be the case that JS programmers use it all the time though.

[20:16:00] <pyzozord> but I want to keep the builds under ~/Projects/typyst somewhere
[20:16:16] <pyzozord> because building the main typyst project requires those sdl2 .so files
[20:16:18] <vdamewood> Is there a ~/Projects/typyst/.git directory?
[20:16:23] <pyzozord> yes
[20:16:32] <vdamewood> Then don't build anywhere in there.
[20:17:10] <pyzozord> but isn't that how everyone does it? I always build all my projects in all languages within the project dir
[20:17:18] <pyzozord> and usually gitignore the build dir

[22:52:18] <Geolykt> On second thought, you might want to use the Scanner class instead (with .useDelimiter("\\s+") called beforehand) as it makes it easier to split up the input. You can then check whether the first character of the string is a quote and if that is the case you got a string and you'd need to find the closing quote (beware of escapes and the fact that the string could be closed in the next string returned by the scanner)
[22:52:47] <mrig> well rather you might want to render whilst resizing, but intermittent with the data so again in series.
[22:54:53] <Geolykt> Actually, it then also depends on whether the language requires spaces between tokens, because if that is not the case Scanner might be a mediocre solution

[23:14:36] <[itchyjunk]> watch out, professional game creator coming through
[23:14:47] <pyzozord> some even stranger things started happening
[23:14:55] <pyzozord> I give up for today
[23:15:06] <pyzozord> I don't have experience debugging multithreading issues
[23:15:54] <mrig> Sounds like fun, i've found go to be pretty cool for experimenting with threading.
[23:17:05] <pyzozord> right now it feels like woodoo
[23:17:14] <pyzozord> things change values and I have no idea why :P
[23:17:22] <mrig> dang, I've left some data on my other OS, will need to reboot to get it :| That's the down side to dual boot.
[23:17:42] <mrig> pyzozord: yes, go gave me a lot more respect for just how complicated it can become.
[23:17:47] <pyzozord> you could let the oses access each other's disk
[23:18:01] <mrig> and it does not have the vagaries of c
[23:18:12] <pyzozord> I think it's not really me makig the changes
[23:18:18] <pyzozord> it's SDL somewhere somehow
[23:18:38] <mrig> yes was just wondering if a shard partition might be possible. Seems like a nice solution.
[23:19:09] <pyzozord> if you are on ntfs both windows and linux should be able to see each other
[23:19:20] <mrig> Oh of course SDL has its own types for threads.
[23:19:24] *** Quits: brickfat (~brickfat@user/brickfat) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:19:46] <pyzozord> it's not just threads, it happens specifically when I resize the window and only if I do so fast

[23:19:59] <pyzozord> and it segvs in multiple places at random, not just one
[23:20:02] *** Quits: yeirr (~yeirr@user/yeirr) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:20:20] <GeDaMo> Maybe resizing reallocates buffers?
[23:20:27] <mrig> Oh that is a point, if I shut down the windows fully I should may be able to see the disk, though I think it is encrypted, would need to make another partition for it.
[23:20:53] <mrig> well see you on the other side ...
[23:20:55] *** Quits: mrig (~mrig@user/mrig) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[23:21:16] <pyzozord> hmm yes. I am relocating buffers on resize, but I do so in controlled environment and quite carefully
[23:21:29] <pyzozord> but maybe SDL relocates the buffer connected to the window anyway

[23:26:54] <pyzozord> actually I don't even resize the window anymore, and this still happens

[23:33:31] <vdamewood> Hmm... On Windows and Linux, you can have separate Runtime and Development components to a library package... On macOS, you really can't separate them if you build as a Framework.

[23:34:09] <vdamewood> Maybe I should get rid of the separated components when building a Framework.
