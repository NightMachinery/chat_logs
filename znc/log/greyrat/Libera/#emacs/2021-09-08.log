[00:25:55] <vitus>  what other values can you set this variable to, and what does it do?
[00:26:10] <vitus> (I'm an emacs noob, started about a month ago)

[00:27:04] <vitus> "Number of completion candidates below which cycling is used."
[00:27:07] <aidalgol> vitus: My answer to your original question would be to use a third-party completion package.
[00:27:27] <aidalgol> I'm using ,,Selectrum,, with Prescient.
[00:27:28] <fsbot> selectrum is like ido helm ivy
[00:27:37] <aidalgol> um... helpful, bot...

[00:28:09] <fsbot> Forgot "selectrum" which had one note:  ["like ido helm ivy"]
[00:28:11] <vitus> my point about the quote: it says "number" so i guess you set it to an integer
[00:28:20] <vitus> what else can u set this variable to?
[00:29:05] <aidalgol> ,Selectrum is a solution for incremental narrowing in Emacs, replacing Helm, Ivy, and IDO. https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum

[00:33:36] <vitus> @pkal it makes sense to me. Say I want to open "Sturm aufs Kapitol.org". I do that with "C-x b stu TAB RET" 
[00:33:41] <aidalgol> ,@
[00:33:42] <fsbot> @ is IRC predates the @nick convention, and most clients don't recognise it. Nick tab-completion and highlighting works anywhere in the line, and the convention for addressing someone named fred is simply "fred: I ate your beans."

[05:39:25] <bpalmer> illya: oh, I see. I don't think there's much of a standard practice for writing a formatter in elisp.
[05:40:26] <bpalmer> you might be able ot hack it together looping across lines, using (current-column), skip-chars-forward " \t" , and then standard edit commands like delete-backward-char, etc

[08:05:39] <parsnip> dale: i have never understood debug-on-message
[08:06:19] <dale> TIL Golang doesn't have a date type that's only a date.  Apparently everything is a time.Time.
[08:06:47] <dale> I was ready to blame SQL Server for another stupid behavior that CAST('2020-01-01' AS DATE) was showing me a date and time, but nope, it was the Go tool I was using.
[08:07:36] <dale> parsnip: Set it to a regexp, and Emacs will check each message output via (message) against that regexp.  If a message being output matches your regexp, Emacs drops you into the debugger.
[08:08:10] <parsnip> yeah but, i've tried it a dozen times and only seen it work for me like once
[08:08:26] <parsnip> i basically deleted it from memory

[10:57:58] * CharlesXVII reading with curiosity on what people are on about with X-emacs
[11:00:21] <yeti> unbearable
[11:00:46] <yeti> he should have written about why HE uses GUI emacs
[11:00:52] <yeti> not telling others what to do
[11:01:10] <CharlesXVII> talismanick: the issue with the GUI features is aesthetics, it's not "rich" text formatting in my view, the terminal emacs is more consistent without different sized-fonts
[11:01:40] <CharlesXVII> and when doing web development, where you'd view images, you'd have a browser
[11:01:47] <CharlesXVII> but I understand the issue for emails and such
[11:01:59] <CharlesXVII> but see spacemacs, fully equipped with unicode icons, it's beautiful
[11:02:09] * CharlesXVII uses doom-emacs though
[11:03:09] <CharlesXVII> talismanick: oh and the API when you need to consider a GUI, it adds tons of pixel-sized metrics and windows, which makes it complicated to debug
[11:03:40] <CharlesXVII> but my main concern, since being homeless and coding using clouds, is also running emacs directly in the cloud, on my phone if anything happens like having to repair my laptop
[11:03:57] <CharlesXVII> being outside, you whip up a keyboard and bluetooth it to the phone, instant emacs over ssh!

[11:07:59] <CharlesXVII> AryaKiran[m]: I've looked into a matrix client for emacs but it looked hard to set up, I didn't understand, do you need to configure a server, it was very unclear
[11:08:25] <CharlesXVII> it had a bunch of adapters for irc, do you configure a server, and configure adapters, it was unclear
[11:08:36] <AryaKiran[m]> ement.el
[11:08:55] <CharlesXVII> and it connects to what on my server?
[11:08:59] <parsnip> i want a floating window manager in the terminal
[11:09:02] <AryaKiran[m]> CharlesXVII: they have a default homeserver. Hosting a server is a bit more resource intensive but is pretty easy
[11:09:15] <CharlesXVII> AryaKiran[m]: I need to keep logs on the server not the client, so ement.el is not enough
[11:09:19] <talismanick> CharlesXVII: Homeless and using Emacs to organize legal defenses?
[11:09:24] * CharlesXVII uses irssi and with tmux+emacs it's fine
[11:09:24] <talismanick> That sounds like quite the life
[11:09:39] <AryaKiran[m]> CharlesXVII: why. matrix persists everything
[11:09:42] <CharlesXVII> talismanick: I'm a political refugee in sweden so it's like that

[11:10:51] <CharlesXVII> lol! :D
[11:11:16] <rnkn> people actually use matrix in a non-ironic way?
[11:11:16] <parsnip> smh
[11:11:17] <CharlesXVII> the idea was to go fully mobile, using the cloud, so you can secure yourself in the event of anything that happens
[11:11:34] <parsnip> rnkn: not me, strictly ironically
[11:11:47] <rnkn> parsnip: I know right
[11:12:01] <parsnip> rnkn: wait, what's the criteria to meet ironic usage of matrix?

[11:13:18] * edgar-rft wants you to smell his cloud
[11:13:25] <parsnip> 🐶
[11:13:31] <CharlesXVII> talismanick: that's why I am developing my own systems now, and am exploring methods to have everything secured from client to cloud
[11:13:33] <talismanick> Then you can use tarsnap and stick your tongue at the NSA
[11:13:35] <AryaKiran[m]> talismanick: just encrypt files with gpg locally 
[11:13:41] <AryaKiran[m]> and put it on the cloud
[11:14:05] <CharlesXVII> Intel SGX to have secure enclaves in the cloud
[11:14:20] <CharlesXVII> client doing PGP before sending, stuff like that, requires custom systems
[11:14:22] <kenran> With gnus and gnus-alias, how can I make it so that I have to select an identity every time before composing an email? I've added gnus-alias-select-identity to 'message-setup-hook and that works, but ofc only when replying.
[11:14:34] <AryaKiran[m]> CharlesXVII: I have SGX disabled in my bios lol
[11:15:05] <CharlesXVII> AryaKiran[m]: you probably don't need it unless like cloud use-cases, it encrypts the memory area on the actual processor
[11:15:28] <AryaKiran[m]> CharlesXVII: oh
[11:15:40] <talismanick> AryaKiran[m]: Some hashes have been broken through (which is why no one uses them anymore), and all the data you upload to "the cloud" can be downloaded until such time as a hole in the crypto system is found
[11:15:54] <rnkn> so now twitter doesn't even let you see pics without signing up

[11:17:07] <talismanick> Maybe they will, maybe they won't.
[11:17:55] <rnkn> isn't it amazing to think that at one point were were just humans wandering around the earth, and at some point some of those humans said "okay now we get to know everything about you guys"

[13:55:49] <dale> Today I re-learned that creating a file named "rm -rfv *|" will cause Perl one-liners such as "perl -ne 's/foo/bar/' *" to run "rm -rfv *" upon hitting that file name in @ARGV.
[13:58:01] <defanor> It seems that Circe's Lui is not packaged/distributed separately, so it may be awkward to use as a dependency in other packages, but are there any other libraries for building generic chat-like Emacs interfaces (preferably aiming multi-line messages)? I'm using a basic custom mode and tracking.el for that now, but it feels a bit like reinventing the wheel.

[17:53:50] <Bayes> ah you've got one of those fancy watches
[17:54:01] <grym> yes, but the same pattern works on my phone 
[17:54:14] <euouae> the way I do it is I tap the yubikey on my phone and get the number
[17:54:20] <Bayes> sucks that I've never got around getting used to wearing watches,
[17:54:25] <euouae> I don't think they're that cumbersome 
[17:54:55] <Bayes> so I tap the Google Authentication app in my phone and I get a 6-digit code

[21:59:04] <haritz> I don't think that matters, because I want tabs instead of spaces
[21:59:06] <haritz> when indenting a block
[21:59:08] <wasamasa> yes, it does
[21:59:14] <wasamasa> emacs has a funny idea of what a tab width is
[21:59:25] <wasamasa> if the calculated indentation is less than the width of a tab, it doesn't replace it with a tab

[21:59:37] <acdw> this is /one/ place where i wish emacs didn't think it was smarter than you
[21:59:50] <wasamasa> so look at your C style and see what the tab width is
[22:00:04] <wasamasa> if it specifies that a tab is 8 spaces wide, but you indent with 2 spaces...
[22:00:04] <haritz> (setq tab-width 8)

[22:00:40] <wasamasa> > NOTE: This controls the display width of a TAB character, and not the size of an indentation step.

[23:40:05] <Bayes> ok thx, I wanted to try them for R but I didn't know which one I wanted to start with
[23:40:13] <grym> vscode, then 
[23:40:18] <grym> pycharm is for python... 
[23:40:35] <Bayes> yeah none is for "R" but both have a plugin for it?

[23:40:56] <alphapapa[m]> Guest86: Emacs already has multiple such packages that look and perform better than that.

[23:44:00] <talismanick> Guest86: I just linked Ivy, which is a minimal frontend for those kinds of incremental completions
[23:44:08] *** Joins: robin (~robin@user/terpri)
[23:44:21] <grym> more maximal solutions could include transient or hydra 
[23:45:01] <Guest86> talismanick alphapapa[m] I was refering more to the UI aspect
[23:45:29] <Guest86> a wrapper for vertico and ivy etc which adds a UI element
[23:46:17] <talismanick> Guest86: If I run counsel-switch-buffer, it shows previews of the buffers as I cycle through the completions
[23:46:45] <talismanick> Not in that layout, specifically, but also not too far off 
[23:47:00] <talismanick> idk how you'd get the completion off to the side like that, specifically
[23:47:00] <alphapapa[m]> Guest86: You're asking very vague questions.
[23:47:13] <alphapapa[m]> talismanick: Helm, of course, does that quite easily.
[23:47:16] <talismanick> but you can move the display of the completion over by way of ivy-posframe

[23:48:00] <ville> Guest86: there is a builtin library to do widgets: buttons, input fields, checkboxes, but i guess that's now what you're talking about
[23:48:01] <alphapapa[m]> talismanick: Helm has many possible configurations, and using a side-by-side or top-and-bottom window configuration is one of them.
