[01:57:55] <galambo> ggreer, not sure if I asked you before, but how do the ak47 and beretta compare to the state of the art?
[01:58:49] <ggreer> what's state of the art? yet another intermediate caliber gas piston design? besides some metallurgy and reliability improvements, the only real wins in the past 50 years have been better sights
[01:59:19] <adiabatic> gwern: " limited opportunities for progression" isn't this just code for "existing employees are being passed over for employees that can help the company hit its DEI targets"
[01:59:42] <gwern> adiabatic: hard to say. it could just as easily refer to a glass ceiling on white/NA employees
[01:59:53] <ggreer> the beretta m9 is hyuge for its capacity and it's kind of expensive, but it's not significantly worse than the sig p320 (and unlike the sig it won't go off if you drop it)
[02:00:16] <ggreer> "Once you pull the trigger (at least for me) my awareness of the target completely disappears." <-- yeah that seems like what would happen if you fired .308 full auto out of an 8 inch barrel
[02:01:36] <galambo> ggreer, but isnt the ak47 known to be reliable? or at least easy to maintain?
[02:02:11] <Dyo> ggreer: how has gun metallurgy changed?
[02:02:43] <ggreer> we can coat parts in hard things that resist rust and wear
[02:03:05] <galambo> isnt there a submachine version of the ak47 with 7.62 or does it use different ammo?
[02:03:08] <ggreer> galambo: yeah it's reliable but it's kind of a pain to strip compared to a modern gun
[02:03:49] <ggreer> the AK uses 7.62x39mm. 7.62 nato is 7.62x51mm. there's also 7.62x54r which is the big round used in mosin nagants and most soviet machine guns

[02:07:59] <galambo> a purple cannula lets in 13mls of fluid per minute. an orange cannula lets in 240mls per minute
[02:08:11] <galambo> not all cannulas are the same
[02:08:20] <galambo> an orange cannula is frightening actually
[02:08:39] <adiabatic> I've had bigger and smaller needles
[02:08:58] <kuudes> wait, 240 ml per minute is 1/4 liter per minute?

[02:28:22] <galambo> ggreer, are you into other stuff like say pens or knives?
[02:28:43] <ggreer> no, not really
[02:29:18] <catern> are 3D printed guns actually much more accessible/useful than what's possible without a 3D-printer? genuine question, I've heard that with some metalworking equipment it's not hard to make a gun, which makes sense, but it's believable that that equipment costs more/is more controlled than the required 3D printer
[02:29:41] <ggreer> only a couple parts of a gun need to be metal
[02:29:59] <ggreer> a modern gun designed for concealed carry has the majority of the volume as plastic
[02:30:42] <galambo> I mean bb guns are all plastic and they can do serious damage
[02:30:57] <ggreer> the 3d printer lets you make accurate shapes that fit the important parts together easily
[02:31:08] <ggreer> also plastics have gotten a lot stronger over the years
[02:31:26] <ggreer> glocks are plastic framed and they can easily survive 100,000 rounds
[02:31:35] <galambo> how about materials like sapphire or diamond?
[02:31:46] <ggreer> those are probably too brittle
[02:31:50] <galambo> or would thye shatter easily

[02:31:57] <ggreer> watch slow mo footage of guns firing and they bend a lot
[02:31:59] <galambo> carbon?
[02:32:22] <galambo> acrylic is soft and very difficult to shatter
[02:32:22] <catern> i'm not saying metal is better than plastic, I'm just talking in terms of maximizing access to weapons and minimizing the ability for state control over who can construct the weapon
[02:32:29] <catern> (ignoring whether that's good or not)
[02:32:45] <galambo> (not THAT difficult to shatter mind you)
[02:32:58] <catern> i know nothing about guns to be clear
[02:33:59] <ggreer> carbon fiber isn't very chemically stable. heat damages it quickly. also it either breaks or it doesn't. most metals (except for aluminum) can withstand an arbitrary number of cycles as long as you stay below elastic deformation
[02:34:54] <ggreer> catern: I think the bottleneck now is ammo. primers, brass, and bullets are all tricky to manufacture
[02:35:45] <ggreer> in the US the fgc-9 isn't popular at all because you can just buy an 80% complete lower receiver and mill it out and have the controlled part of an AR-15 or glock
[02:35:56] <ggreer> it takes like 30 minutes
[02:36:08] <galambo> ggreer, this indiates the fgc-9 is an inferior gun
[02:36:20] <Dyo> brass is hard to manufacture?
[02:36:24] <ggreer> Dyo: brass casings
[02:36:31] <Dyo> ah right
[02:36:56] <ggreer> galambo: yes, but it has to satisfy a harder constraint. it uses completely legal things in the EU to make a gun
[02:37:29] <ggreer> if you use completely legal things in the US to make a gun, you have a much easier time. the US has some weird legal history where the pressure-bearing parts aren't considered the firearm
[02:37:34] <galambo> ah so its the bitcoin of guns
[02:38:00] <catern> ggreer: specifically I remember reading somewhere that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun) was basically just a stunt because you could pretty easily weld together a similar or better gun out of just random metal parts you can buy at any hardware store (including presumably in Europe), and I was wondering if that's true of the FGC-9
[02:38:00] <Robomot> Liberator (gun) - Wikipedia (The Liberator is a physible (3D-printable) single shot handgun, the first such printable firearm design made widely available online.[2][3][4] The open source firm Defense Distributed designed the gun and released the plans on the Internet on May 6, 2013. ‚Ä¶)
[02:39:09] <ggreer> for example: I carry a sig p365. I wanted a longer slide assembly with a red dot sight mount, so I ordered it online and had it shipped to me. no ID check or anything. it was just dropped off on my porch. that part contained another barrel, another slide, and another striker. it just needed to be mounted to the frame (which, although it's just a tiny stamped piece of metal, is legally considered the firearm)
[02:40:06] <galambo> ggreer, didnt you just say that gun fires if you drop it?
[02:40:10] <ggreer> catern: that's accurate. the point was to get some case law combining the first two amendments. the fgc-9 is a rather heavy gun for what it does, but it's not terrible
[02:40:18] <ggreer> galambo: that's the sig p320, though they did fix that
[02:41:21] <ggreer> the p365 came out a few years later. they drop tested the hell out of that one to make sure they didn't have a repeat recall

[02:42:02] <saturn2> catern: whether you can weld a better gun out of hardware store parts probably depends a lot on your skill, whereas 3d printing just requires simple assembly
[02:42:13] <ggreer> sig is just dumb when it comes to designing triggers. if they put a little trigger safety on them like glock and everyone else, they'd never run into this issue
[02:42:52] <catern> saturn2: sure, that makes some intuitive sense to me, but it might not be true, that's why I was asking ggreer
[02:43:10] <ggreer> yeah the important thing about the fgc-9 is that it can be constructed with zero welds
[02:43:12] <galambo> why cant guns have something like a laser sight with an infrared sight, and then just let you fire fire when the infrared is triggered
[02:43:24] <galambo> infrared trigger
[02:43:43] <ggreer> because that's easy to modify to full auto, so it's restricted for everything but the military
[02:44:12] <catern> saturn2: also, if, say, doing it with hardware store stuff costs $10 in fixed costs and $100 per unit cost, and a 3D printer has $3000 fixed costs and $500 per unit costs... then "just learn some metalworking" starts to seem preferable
[02:44:17] <ggreer> also electronics fail. also they're hard to maintain. I have a gun that is almost 100 years old

[02:44:31] <catern> (so I was also wondering about that)
[02:44:48] <galambo> ggreer, so not only is it possible to manufacture the fgc-9 in europe where guns are illegal, the fgc-9 is not even legal by us standards
[02:45:32] <ggreer> galambo: hmm... depends on how you build the fire control assembly. also you'd want a longer barrel (minimum barrel length is 16" unless you do the paperwork to register a short-barreled rifle)

[02:46:46] <catern> ggreer: is that one good enough in whatever respect to make the FGC-9? i.e. is an arbitrary cheap 3D printer good enough for that
[02:46:58] <ggreer> yes. that's the one recommended by the people who made the fgc-9
[02:47:37] <catern> neat, but I assume it still has lots of cost in plastic feed
[02:47:52] <catern> the dream of self-replicating reprap printers may have failed, but making guns is similarly cyberpunk and cool
[02:48:00] <ggreer> filament is like $20 per roll
[02:49:05] <catern> surely the unit costs are still cheaper with hardware store parts though?
[02:49:23] <ggreer> probably. 3d printing takes a lot of time
[02:49:36] <galambo> I think this open weapon is one of the stronger arguments against libertarianism. what happens if we open source a weapon of mass destruction?

[03:33:22] <catern> as we all know, healthcare is not about health, it's about signalling - maybe the value of nationalized healthcare is, ironically, to *restrain* spending - otherwise people individually will massively overspend to signal that they care - maybe this is why public sector healthcare seems to be surprisingly cheaper than private sector healthcare

[03:45:04] <galambo> from the article
[03:45:05] <galambo> Why do I think this ideology is so dangerous? The short answer is that elevating the fulfilment of humanity‚Äôs supposed potential above all else could nontrivially increase the probability that actual people ‚Äì those alive today and in the near future ‚Äì suffer extreme harms, even death. Consider that, as I noted elsewhere, the longtermist ideology inclines its adherents to take an insouciant attitude towards climate change. Why? Because ev
[03:45:05] <galambo> en if climate change causes island nations to disappear, triggers mass migrations and kills millions of people, it probably isn‚Äôt going to compromise our longterm potential over the coming trillions of years.

[04:04:23] <adiabatty> Obormot\Arcturus: I haven't even looked into it deeply but I thought it was interesting. I'm a teeny bit unsettled by how my preferred markup format is a weirdo zipped XML file (OmniOutliner), plus one can do neat things with a machine-readable format.

[04:04:51] <adiabatty> Like, if your recipe calls for butter three times, you can have the program add up all the amounts and tell you how much butter to buy at the store
[04:05:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Well... I'll re-appraise when I see some of these alleged neat things. Until then, this seems like a lot of work for nothing.
[04:05:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> ALSO! Their git repo has some sample recipes and one of them is Olivier salad, a dish with which I am *very* familiar
[04:05:42] <adiabatty> it is a lot of work for something, maybe not worth it

[04:05:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> WRONG!!!
[04:06:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Corned beef in Olivier salad?! Are these people out of their minds
[04:06:08] <adiabatty> then again, this sounds like a fun project to work on
[04:06:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct meat in Olivier salad is Doktorskaya kolbasa (or some more or less suitable substitute)

[04:08:49] <catern> i.e., you say "I want to make these things" and it tells you what to purchase and tracks how much you have left
[04:08:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Also, looking at this, I see one obvious design flaw, which is that the format offers a rendering tool no way to segregate ingredients by separable recipe component

[05:41:54] <catern> hmmmm
[05:42:09] <catern> harberger taxes... anarchism...
[05:42:49] <catern> the ability of someone to take property if they pay more in warring against its owner than the owner wants to pay in defense, is kind of like harberger taxes
[05:43:39] <PlanckWalk> The broken-window version of Harberger taxes
[05:45:34] <catern> like, you pay some annual tax to your defense agency which covers your property for $X amount of defense, at an annual cost of some fraction of $X
[05:47:10] <catern> and if someone else wants it more than $X (or, more than X times the relative effectiveness of offense and defense) then they can just war against you, but of course because this is civilized ancapistan your defense agency knows how the war will play out, so they will just kick you out and hand it over to someone else
[05:51:03] <gwern> if your property is worth $X total, then an attacker is willing to pay up to $X-1 to attack you. defense usually has an advantage of something like 3:1, so it would cost a defender $X*0.33 to defend your $X and so *they* require $X*0.33+1 to defend you. you won't get very far paying out a 33% property tax every attack
[05:52:27] <catern> (in this world, the relative effectiveness of offense and defense must always be tilted in favor of defense, because otherwise, if they actually value it less than you but could only get it because of the advantage offense, you could just war against them again and get it back again)
[05:52:31] <gwern> this gets worse when your property can be worth only $X but is worth $Y when exploited. the usual example being, say, what if 'coinbase.com' was auctioned off to the highest-bidder every 10 minutes?
[05:54:26] <catern> gwern: i'm not sure what you mean by "paying out every attack"? it's insurance, not actual defense, so X*0.33 defense coverage can cost much less than X*0.33 - in civilized ancapistan, no need for actual war since everyone is rational and reveals their true military capabilities
[05:54:54] <gwern> attacks don't happen at random or exogenously and can be precommitted to
[05:55:24] <catern> sure, but if your attack won't gain you anything then there's no value in precomitting to an attack
[05:55:42] <gwern> how does that work for patent trolls or lawsuits?
[05:56:12] <catern> if everyone had patent troll insurance, there would be no patent trolls :)
[05:56:27] <catern> sadly we don't live in Hansonistan
[05:56:48] <catern> (and also therefore patent troll insurance would be cheap)
[05:57:01] <catern> (and part of general liability insurance)
[06:01:21] <PlanckWalk> Some patent trolls actually win.
[06:02:28] <PlanckWalk> If it were a contest of who could bribe the judge the most, then insurance might help.
[06:02:58] <catern> yes yes, that's why the liability insurance would come with conditions on your behavior and audits, etc, standard stuff
[06:03:25] <catern> so there would be no "patent trolls", only legitimate patent suits against genuinely illegitimate infringement
[06:03:54] <catern> (rather than the current situation where people don't have liability insurance so if they get sued they have to pay out of pocket)
[06:03:55] <PlanckWalk> It seems to me that patent lawyers win even more in that world.
[06:04:51] <PlanckWalk> Since to qualify for insurance, *everyone* needs to pay patent lawyers.
[06:05:32] <PlanckWalk> To do the very expensive searches on everything they might possibly be sued on.
[06:07:45] <catern> assuming arguendo that patent law is good and correct, the costs of compliance with patent law are by assumption worth it - you're just saying "it's more expensive to comply with the law than not", sure, could be
[06:08:29] <PlanckWalk> I'm saying it's something like an order of magnitude more expensive to *prove* that you are complying with patent law than not.
[06:08:38] *** Quits: galambo (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[06:08:42] <catern> you're not required to prove that you're complying with patent law
[06:09:08] <PlanckWalk> Who will insure you if you haven't?
[06:09:17] <catern> does health insurance require you to prove that you're maximally healthy? does fire insurance require you to prove that you're not using any fire with 100 feet of your home?
[06:09:20] <PlanckWalk> I'm just comparing with other insurances
[06:09:44] <gwern> catern: they can? like, life insurance absolutely can require you to go get inspected by a doctor
[06:09:46] <PlanckWalk> Fire insurance definitely requires you to document that you comply with fire codes, have alarms, etc
[06:09:49] <catern> gwern: exactly!
[06:09:53] <catern> PlanckWalk: exactly
[06:10:02] <catern> they require a minimum due diligence
[06:10:08] <PlanckWalk> But patent law compliance is *much more expensive*
[06:10:11] <catern> they don't require some kind of maximalist whatever you're imagining
[06:10:14] <gwern> (and what is 'discovery' if not proving you are complying?)
[06:10:46] <catern> PlanckWalk: just to fill in the obvious blank, you don't have to prove you're compliant
[06:11:04] <catern> you just have to show that you're following the obvious practices that make you 90% likely to be compliant
[06:11:14] <catern> according to their actuaries
[06:11:15] <PlanckWalk> There's pretty much nothing in between having a patent lawyer search all relevant fields, and not do any searches.
[06:11:31] <PlanckWalk> In terms of actual risk
[06:11:40] <catern> lol, well, try to actually think of something in between there for more than 0 seconds
[06:11:45] <catern> and I'm sure you'll come up with something
[06:11:50] <PlanckWalk> I've *been there*.
[06:12:17] <PlanckWalk> I've received legal advice
[06:12:57] <PlanckWalk> The legal advice is to either spent >$100k, or failing that *I'm actually better off legally doing nothing*
[06:13:33] <gwern> because a partial search can be used to imply you knew about infringement which incurs extra damages?
[06:13:45] <PlanckWalk> But I guess that's part of the counterfactual "assuming arguendo that patent law is good and correct"
[06:13:50] <PlanckWalk> gwern: Exactly
[06:14:25] <PlanckWalk> If you document that you did any sort of patent search, that can be used as evidence that you *should have* known about infringement.
[06:15:03] <PlanckWalk> And they can ask for more damages.
[06:15:05] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:16:24] <PlanckWalk> So yeah, maybe in some universe patent law would be good and correct, but this one is all kinds of fouled up.
[06:16:32] <catern> if indeed you're better of legally doing nothing, then there's some very obvious things that an insurance company would want from you, to demonstrate to their actuaries that you're likely to be safe...
[06:16:45] *** Joins: galambo (galambo@user/galambo)
[06:16:59] <catern> (like, say: document and enforce that you are doing nothing, have an enforced policy that engineers not look at existing inventions/patents in your field, etc)
[06:17:54] <catern> if there's anything you can do to protect yourself from patent trolls then a patent troll insurance company could gently nudge you to do those things to reduce your risk
[06:18:17] <PlanckWalk> None of which reduces the payout to patent trolls.
[06:18:42] <catern> yes it does... have you heard of "deterrence"...
[06:18:45] <PlanckWalk> Err rather, none of which precludes the *viability* of patent trolls.
[06:19:13] <catern> what does "patent troll" mean?
[06:19:42] <PlanckWalk> You tell me
[06:19:51] <catern> is a patent troll someone who files suits that have no merit in the hopes of getting a settlement? if that's what a patent troll is, then insurance will completely eliminate patent trolls
[06:20:30] <PlanckWalk> They don't always have no merit
[06:20:48] <PlanckWalk> (Because as stated, patent law is all kinds of fouled up)
[06:21:02] <PlanckWalk> No *moral* merit, sure.
[06:21:08] <PlanckWalk> Legal merit, yes.
[06:21:12] <catern> if on the other hand "patent troll" just means "someone who has patents and enforces them in many cases, some which have merit and others which have no merit", then insurance will encourage them to only file suit when their case has merit
[06:21:41] <catern> by reducing the expected payout from no-merit cases from "slightly lower than merit cases because most people settle" to "0"
[06:22:11] <catern> sometimes they will get it wrong and file a case without merit, and insurance will cover that and they'll lose the case
[06:22:35] <PlanckWalk> Or not
[06:23:00] <catern> the assumption is that a case without merit will be lost if argued by competent lawyers at trial
[06:23:20] <PlanckWalk> Much more likely insurance will make the same expected-value calculation that individuals do: defending this, *with merit or not* will cost more than the settlement.
[06:23:24] <catern> sometimes that will fail and, again, insurance will cover that
[06:23:33] <catern> the occassional instance of those situations, plus your expected actual risk of infringing-without-knowing, will be the basis of infringe
[06:23:42] <catern> the basis of your insurance premiums*
[06:24:03] <catern> no...
[06:24:19] <catern> the point of insurance is that they aggregate many risks and can make macroscopic decisions that are better
[06:24:34] <PlanckWalk> Better for whom?
[06:24:35] <catern> it's a single-owner solution
[06:24:47] <catern> better for the insurance company, which is also better for society in this case
[06:25:13] <PlanckWalk> The only advantage I see is that the company might be better at lobbying for patent reform.
[06:26:21] <catern> shrug, the nature of a single-owner choosing the overall best policy versus many individuals making individually good decisions causing a commons dilemma, is basic economics
[06:26:26] <catern> if you don't see that, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[06:26:56] <PlanckWalk> The big difference between the military scenario and the patent troll one is that the costs are often asymmetric in the other direction.
[06:27:13] <PlanckWalk> The attacker has a cost advantage
[06:27:19] <gwern> (even ideal perfectly-enforced patents have deadweights you know)
[06:27:46] <catern> gwern: yeah I'm not intending to defend patent law here, I don't like intellectual property :)

[06:41:53] <saturn2> so the idea is when a patent troll shows up, the insurance pays you the profit you expected to make from your invention, and you settle with the patent troll by giving them your corporation (which is probably near worthless without you)?

[07:01:24] <catern> saturn2: er no, the idea is that the insurance funds your defence in the lawsuit if it seems meritless, or settles with the patent troll in money if it seems you're actually infringing - (and that settlement wouldn't transfer the company making it worthless... if the patent troll wants money then they'd prefer money+licensing their patent over receiving a worthless company+not having to license out their patent)

The contradictions are obvious: Teen Vogue maintains a socialist bent while trying to commodify its brand for advertisers primarily in the fashion and beauty industry.

[10:03:37] <feep> well, bavaria

[10:04:36] <feep> all saints day
[10:05:50] <adiabatic> nice
[10:06:02] <adiabatic> Bavaria‚Ä¶more Catholic than most?
[10:06:12] <feep> yes but hang on there's a funny thing
[10:06:58] <feep> oh right! I was thinking of ascension day, not all saints
[10:08:14] <feep> adiabatic: see the funny thing about ascension day is
[10:08:38] <feep> that really is a holiday that only exists in catholic provinces
[10:08:48] <feep> or rather, specifically, it exists in provinces that are more catholic than protestant
[10:09:02] <feep> the funny thing about this is that nowadays bavaria is majority atheist.
[10:09:11] <feep> which was *not* accounted for in that law XD
[10:09:16] <feep> so we're cheating a holiday, basically
[10:09:29] <adiabatic> is it atheister than other regions? I thought the ossis were the atheististest.
[10:09:46] <feep> they are, the ossis are turbo atheist
[10:10:10] <feep> oh hang on, double check says we're still only 35%
[10:10:14] <feep> I was looking at munich data
[10:10:20] <feep> well, I live in munich so it still works~
[10:10:46] <feep> yeah bavaria total is 46% catholic still
[10:11:48] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: were sitcoms forbidden for political reasons, or were they simply not liked?
[10:12:07] <feep> adiabatic: oh double check, but it's celebrated in *bavarian provinces* that are majority catholic
[10:12:20] <feep> and even munich is still "majority catholic", even though it's actually majority atheist.
[10:12:34] <adiabatic> is it plurality-Catholic?
[10:12:40] <feep> what's that mean?
[10:13:14] <adiabatic> majority: 50%+Œµ. plurality: biggest single chunk (even if that's just 5% in a sea of 1% other slivers of a pie chart)
[10:13:24] <feep> oic, no it's plurality atheist
[10:13:36] <feep> no majority
[10:13:50] <adiabatic> Is it the biggest non-atheist religion, at least?
[10:13:58] <saturn2> it really ought to be Other Saints Day, otherwise it makes all the other holidays redundant
[10:13:59] <feep> 45 atheist, 32 catholic, 11 protestant and 0.3% jewish <3
[10:14:09] <feep> saints can have more than one day :D
[10:14:33] <adiabatic> OK, so of the not-nones (no Muslims?), Catholics have the biggest slice. Makes sense.
[10:14:50] <feep> no there's muslims, hang on, why are they not listed
[10:14:52] <feep> might be 8%?
[10:15:29] <feep> apparently we stopped counting in 2014 :o
[10:15:42] <saturn2> saints not otherwise celebrated day. happy SNOCD
[10:15:59] <adiabatic> saints that, at a distance, resemble flies day

[10:16:30] <portmanteau> this is a weird channel

[10:17:31] <PapuaHardyNet> praying to god to punish us heretics, of course
[10:18:06] <feep> adiabatic: anyway, above 10% probably by now. atheism still has a comfortable lead.
[10:18:07] <adiabatic> You'd think counting the number of muslims would be important, what with all the immigration you all have had since, uh, what's-his-name
[10:18:24] <feep> we too are beset by ~politics~
[10:18:32] <feep> that is at least 30% copypaste from america
[10:18:42] <PapuaHardyNet> germany is 30% as bad as usa?
[10:18:48] <feep> no, I mean literally copypasted
[10:18:56] <PapuaHardyNet> same thing
[10:18:58] <feep> yes
[10:19:13] <adiabatic> Only 30%? Impressive. In Western Europe, probably only the French do better.
[10:19:26] <feep> well it depends on where you go
[10:19:34] <PapuaHardyNet> german fundamentalists believe that there are too many immigrants in germany?
[10:19:54] <PapuaHardyNet> and the people in power are liberal who are falling head over heels to invite immigrants to germany?

[16:24:08] <Gurkenglas> We've seen that worldwide policies are more correlated than a libertarian might hope. Suppose politicians decided a free internet is bad. How technically difficult would it be to, say, make it impossible for even an expert to download a particular book?
[16:25:06] <feep> you would have to outlaw encryption
[16:25:36] <two2thehead> ggreer, TIL that the .50 cal bmg cartridge has now been used for more than a century
[16:25:47] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: if sci-hub goes down, worldwide progress will slow by a significant fraction
[16:25:56] <two2thehead> In service: 1921‚Äìpresent
[16:26:01] <Gurkenglas> feep, or perhaps, force routers to discard encrypted packets
[16:26:02] <PapuaHardyNet> encryption isn't useful without centralized services that leverage it
[16:26:22] <feep> Gurkenglas: that's equivalent
[16:26:31] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: there's decentralized filesharing services
[16:26:43] <PapuaHardyNet> b-but wait - Gurkenglas, internet isn't free right now
[16:26:45] <feep> freenet is literally designed for this exact usecase
[16:27:21] <Gurkenglas> feep, it seems more enforcable than preventing someone from doing arbitrary computation on their device
[16:28:14] <feep> yeah but again, they're both equally impractical
[16:28:19] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, I smell a definition dispute, but okay: What do you mean?
[16:28:33] <PapuaHardyNet> I pay for bandwidth and access to the internet
[16:28:37] <Gurkenglas> feep, what is impractical about having routers drop packets?
[16:28:51] <feep> Gurkenglas: the part where you say goodbye to all corporate vpns :p

[16:30:14] <feep> I think you could maybe do something like 
[16:30:30] <feep> mandate encryption be backdoored, drop all packets that you can't decrypt?
[16:30:46] <feep> but states that try this will have a disadvantage if their opponents are interested in corporate espionage
[16:31:10] <Gurkenglas> Hmm. Is it possible to have a backdoor that won't inevitably leak?
[16:31:11] <feep> cause like ... you need to have the decryption key on all your centralized routers
[16:31:18] <feep> sure, possible. leaks are a social problem
[16:31:34] <feep> bout as possible as a huge conspiracy that stays secret
[16:31:49] <Gurkenglas> Every router could have its own backdoor key, so it's less of a single point of failure
[16:31:55] <feep> no
[16:32:03] <feep> because every router has to be able to decode every message
[16:32:21] <feep> you wouldn't necessarily know which key got leaked
[16:32:48] <feep> the point is, you're pushing against probability
[16:33:04] <Gurkenglas> How about: You establish a connection over a particular 10 routers. Y'all establish a secure channel that exactly the endpoints and those routers can read
[16:33:37] <Gurkenglas> Not technically a backdoor, right? Any "leak" would be a compromised router, for exactly as long as it stays compromised
[16:34:20] <Gurkenglas> At which point... why did we encrypt this, again? What are corporate vpns for?
[16:34:28] <feep> no idea if that's possible
[16:34:38] <feep> also like, wfh, datacenter connections..
[16:34:40] <Gurkenglas> They're trying to be resistant to someone taking over a router along the way, right?
[16:34:57] <feep> mostly exploited wifi but yes that also
[16:36:21] <Gurkenglas> It sure is possible to encrypt end-to-end between two parties; a chain of 11 such connections works for the 10-router chain
[16:36:43] <feep> no because then each router can read you
[16:36:54] <feep> maybe if you onion route it?
[16:38:11] <Gurkenglas> A comprimise would be that encrypted packets are dropped only at boundaries between borders; and then there's a particular router on the border which lets them through if you give the NSA the key for that stream
[16:38:38] <Gurkenglas> And you're supposed to trust that *that* router's info doesn't go to Pepsi HQ
[16:38:46] <Gurkenglas> -info+log
[16:39:06] <Gurkenglas> *only at borders between countries <.<

[16:46:08] <Gurkenglas> this isn't about most people, it's about the very few smart people that are involved in any particular x-risk. Perhaps there is some way that doesn't work if many people try to circumvent it?
[16:46:50] <feep> yes there is, it's called "send the police over to confiscate the server"
[16:46:55] <Gurkenglas> aka, contain 50 scientists, fall before 500000 protesters
[16:48:58] <Gurkenglas> Is scihub actually good for our chances? It does accelerate science.
[16:50:53] <feep> not sure it matters
[16:50:54] <Gurkenglas> Does sending the police over to confiscate the server reliably work? The 50 scientists can be using onion, after all.
[16:51:01] <feep> surely google can afford magazine subscriptions
[16:51:04] <feep> onion still needs a server
[16:51:07] <feep> tor*
[16:51:36] <Gurkenglas> yeah but that can be any ol' botnet slave on the internet, right? confiscate it, another pops up
[16:51:40] <feep> it doesn't matter anyway
[16:51:49] <feep> because nobody will stop the 50 scientists even if we have all this tech.
[16:52:10] <feep> because all their resources will be taken up going after more politically beneficial enemies
[16:53:27] <Gurkenglas> Wouldn't making "is scientific progress good?" a political issue have a significant chance of coming out with either answer?
[16:54:09] <Gurkenglas> step 1: make all the countries even more correlated. step 2: roll the dice on halting progress
[16:54:13] <feep> sure if you can get the anti progress party over 0.01%
[16:55:34] <feep> that said, p sure ai safety will be first on the chopping block
[16:55:41] <Gurkenglas> how so?
[16:56:12] <feep> my model is that ai safety research is driven, if by anything, then by dramatic ai results
[16:57:01] <Gurkenglas> we had ai safety research before the dramatic ai results - do you mean it went way up since?
[16:57:18] <Gurkenglas> i hear the way-up is useless except for the interpretability work
[16:57:49] <feep> would people have taken bostrom as seriously without alphago, gpt, etc?
[16:58:02] <Gurkenglas> i did before it was cool :3
[16:58:16] <feep> well I mean sure but like
[16:58:19] <feep> in a funding relevant amount
[16:58:30] <Gurkenglas> do we need funding, anyway?
[16:58:44] <feep> yyyes? we're competing with like google
[16:58:51] <feep> for employment
[16:59:43] <Gurkenglas> hmm maybe there are in fact some people who are not useless in ai safety and who are moved by marginal dollars atm
[17:00:35] <Gurkenglas> isn't this effect from dramatic ai results even stronger on the ai capabilities research
[17:00:55] <feep> maybe.
[17:01:16] <feep> I guess it depends on how the hardware overhang works out
[17:01:47] <Gurkenglas> even if they are, 2x salary for ai researchers probably has less of an effect than 2x salary for ai safety researchers
[17:02:05] <Gurkenglas> -even if they are+even if it is
[17:02:33] <Gurkenglas> (which argues in favor of your side, if you're confused :P)
[17:02:44] <feep> ^^
[17:03:21] <feep> anyway, shutting down free science would imo fight more against ai safety than ai capability
[17:03:46] <feep> because capability coordinates more easily, since it's more corporate driven
[17:04:19] <Gurkenglas> therefore... push hard on AI taxes?

[17:05:27] <pompolic> "man holding head" is the intent
[17:06:04] <Gurkenglas> Ah, on the table, under folded hands. Why are you opposed?
[17:06:34] <nshepperd2> its more like a person cowering in fear
[17:06:39] <PapuaHardyNet> "The most prominent feature of the deal is the 15 percent global minimum tax, which is expected to be enacted by each country that has agreed to the deal. That rate will apply to multinational corporations with annual revenues of more than $867 million."
[17:06:39] <feep> I mean, if you want more AI
[17:06:59] <kiboneu> we've already made ai
[17:07:03] <feep> which is very relatable, glorious cyberpunk future etc
[17:08:13] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: it may be basic bitch but i am emotionally still not okay with my money being taken effectively at gunpoint
[17:08:29] <pompolic> i'll pay it but i won't ever like it
[17:08:42] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, what about CO2 taxes
[17:08:58] <kiboneu> this requires cooperation amongst countries. it wont happen
[17:09:20] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: will i get murderized if i don't pay them
[17:09:56] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, your bank will be told to hand em over :oP
[17:10:37] <pompolic> w/e it's ultimately backed by initiation of force
[17:11:10] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, what if money was backed by the government's consent?
[17:11:41] <pompolic> i think that's a problem too
[17:11:57] <Gurkenglas> and every dollar bill says "this bill is worth one dollar for as long as the government's server doesn't list this serial number"
[17:13:03] <Gurkenglas> kiboneu, what if the countries first construct a deal that says "anyone who flees a tax has to pay it to the new country"?
[17:13:08] <pompolic> i'm not sure what the point here is
[17:14:11] <pompolic> that governmental entities have a to-me unacceptable level of control over the economy, i already know
[17:14:40] <pompolic> s/governmental entities/governments/
[17:15:06] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, i'm trying to find a loophole in your ethics; i like libertarian ideas, and they seem compatible with taxing negative externalities
[17:15:23] <feep> I mean, what exactly is a governmental entity
[17:15:29] <feep> you could do all of this with a private individual
[17:15:52] <Gurkenglas> who's in favor of legalizing cannabis in germany? the green ("hippie") party and the yellow ("corporate") party
[17:16:08] <pompolic> bold of you to assume i have ethics
[17:16:37] <feep> technically the social democrats too
[17:16:50] <Gurkenglas> oh? ok. what's technical about it?

[17:17:06] <feep> well, um
[17:17:10] <feep> the amount of fucks given :p
[17:17:30] <pompolic> also re: taxing negative externalities: i think there is a problem with who gets to determine externalities
[17:17:40] <pompolic> then they'll hold unacceptable amount of power or something
[17:17:50] <pompolic> i didn't think through this too much
[17:18:38] <pompolic> to the extent this is an ethical argument, it's "i don't like coercion"

[17:59:50] <pompolic> abandon all hope ye who enter here
[18:02:56] <gwern> quite difficult. GPT's BPEs wouldn't even cover both columns of a mangled PDF to let it even *try* to reconstruct a clean text transcript
[18:03:43] <gwern> (gpt-3 can undo simple OCR errors, I have a script for that, but even there it makes mistakes in guessing the original so I have to proofread)
[18:03:56] <kiboneu> isn't there document layout classifier recently published?

[18:04:38] <kiboneu> im at work so i'll search and grab links later
[18:06:11] <pompolic> what do you think are the biggest obstacles to text extraction?
[18:06:34] <pompolic> or rather the top 2-3 ways it goes wrong
[18:08:05] <kiboneu> top is probably associating heuristics provided by forms on the page (boundaries, spaces, font sizes) to associate which paragraph or figure a text belongs to
[18:09:24] <kiboneu> html tables and pdf bytesteams don't give you that information because it's suited for how human eyes will interpret these details
[18:12:29] <pompolic> hmm
[18:12:59] <pompolic> pdf bytestreams do provide layouting information, but i think that doesn't contradict your point
[18:13:26] <pompolic> you kind of need to actually do the layout to understand it in context
[18:14:24] <kiboneu> one could associate bytestream layout info with visual results
[18:14:47] <gwern> big models are a good way to attack it. multimodal, or even working on the pixel sequence. but gpt-2 is not going to cut it
[18:15:19] <kiboneu> (but that seems problematic due to lack of guarantees of consistency between the source and visual output)
[18:15:33] <kiboneu> gwern: yes, preprocessing is necessary
[18:15:41] <kiboneu> with another network
[18:15:53] <kiboneu> it's like the thing brains do
[18:16:57] <kiboneu> i can fly through papers a large part because there's a circuit within me that's used to the layout / suggestions provided by the layouts of papers; it's just reflex of knowing where to look
[18:17:06] <pompolic> i'm thinking of having an AST tagged with positional information
[18:17:58] <pompolic> so you could filter it with queries like "ok computer get me bottom left of page 1"
[18:18:23] <pompolic> or just definining visual queries on an ast could be interesting
[18:19:44] <catern> So back on my "war is a natural Harberger tax"...
[18:19:51] <catern> If I pay some annual rent X to get X/p dollars of defense insurance for some property, and someone else demonstrates a willingness to pay qX/p on attacking me, where q is the relative effectiveness of offense and defense, then they might as well just pay qX/p directly to me.  If my true value for the property is Y, I want qX/p = Y, so my annual rent X = p/q * Y.
[18:19:51] <catern> So p/q is the natural Harberger tax rate...  q is dependent on current technology etc, but what determines p?

[18:59:56] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: for that complex eigenvalue thing probably a good place to start would be looking at the 90¬∞ rotation matrix [[0 -1] [1 0]]
[19:00:33] <nshepperd2> which doesn't have any real eigenvectors bc if you apply it to any nonzero real point it, well, rotates it 90¬∞ to a different point
[19:01:37] <nshepperd2> but if you apply it to say, [1, i] then it results in [i, -1]
[19:01:46] <nshepperd2> which is the same as multiplying the vector by i
[19:02:40] <shawwwn> sure, but
[19:02:47] <nshepperd2> there is probably some connection to how you can implement complex numbers as 2x2 matrices
[19:03:27] <shawwwn> hmm
[19:04:52] <shawwwn> my confusion is, I'm trying to get some kind of intuitive understanding of eigenvectors. previously, my intuitive understanding was https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1454597334608797700

[19:05:13] <shawwwn> so I was feeling nice and proud of my intuitive understanding
[19:05:55] <shawwwn> and then quite predictably, the entire internet (which I love) pointed out why my understanding "isn't even useful," let alone complete

[19:07:45] <nshepperd2> ah i see

[19:12:06] <shawwwn> well
[19:12:14] <shawwwn> the way this all started, was that a coworker said something interesting
[19:12:39] <shawwwn> he said "a matrix multiplication can be thought of as, decompose the matrix into its eigenvectors, then project the vector onto each eigenvector"
[19:13:01] <shawwwn> *that* type of thing is exactly the intuitive understanding I'm after

[20:19:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "When tested with larger quantities, the spiders didn‚Äôt distinguish between three or higher, lumping them all into one category of ‚Äúmany.‚Äù" ... isn't this also true of some human cultures? Hunter-gatherers and so on?
[20:19:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow that is an adorable and beautiful spider
[20:20:11] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: pirah√£
[20:20:16] <ggreer> in language, yeah. but without counting humans can usually distinguish up to 5 or 7
[20:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But these clever little spiders are skilled at getting out of dangerous situations, as Nelson found. Her lab at the University of Canterbury developed a test to see how good Portia is at assessing escape routes. Though they can swim, jumping spiders hate water, and for these experiments a spider started on a platform surrounded by a tray filled with water. It had four ways to get across the water to the edge of the tray that
[20:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  involved leaping between little islands made of wooden dowels sticking out of the water.
[20:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Portia chose the safest route that covered the shortest distance and required the fewest jumps more often than chance would predict. But when they didn‚Äôt choose the safest way, the spiders unexpectedly seemed to prefer the longest route with the most dowels. It turns out, Portia had simply outsmarted the test: the longest path was curved, and Portia often took shortcuts by skipping dowels. ‚ÄúBasically, they just cheated,‚Äù
[20:20:29] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Nelson says."
[20:20:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> So they built an IRL platformer for spiders
[20:20:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the spiders speedran it
[20:21:49] <feep> portia's the best

[20:24:50] <Robomot> We've Learned Jumping Spiders Can See the Moon, Thanks to Twitter (Baby spiders crawling through an astronomer's office have led to a fascinating revelation.)
[20:26:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow this website is one of those that's fucked with AKS and unreadable without AKS
[20:26:52] <pompolic> vision of the future
[20:27:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, Reader view fixes it... for now
[20:27:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The fun began when Jamie Lomax‚Äôs office ceiling began raining baby jumping spiders last week."
[20:27:17] <ggreer> my guess is that the piraha are *really* stupid. they're probably some inbred tribe that doesn't like outsiders. leave them alone long enough and they might even end up like the sentinelese
[20:27:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "When Levesque aimed a red laser pointer near one of the spiders, the arachnid seemed somewhat motivated to meander around and follow the dot. But when she aimed a green laser pointer at the same spider? The zebra spider went nuts, chasing the green spot like it was a cat."
[20:27:40] <ggreer> chimpanzees can distinguish up to 9 objects (it's one of the few mental tasks that chimps are better than humans at)
[20:28:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "‚ÄúAfter all I've learned on Twitter over the past 24 hours, spiders are way more interesting and a little less creepy than I had previously thought,‚Äù she says.
[20:28:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> ‚ÄúThey can see the moon just like me! I can't kill them now that I know that.‚Äù" ... awwww
[20:39:16] <ggreer> therefore it's wrong to kill psychopaths and ok to kill blind people?

[20:48:44] <ggreer> scott's bit about spacex doesn't understand that taking spacex public would make it very difficult for spacex to do what musk wants it to do. public companies have all kinds of restrictions around trading windows, what you're allowed to say about future plans, lots more regulatory and reporting issues. oh and you have more shareholders meaning more crazy people who can sue you for dumb shit
[20:50:26] <ggreer> spacex isn't limited by money. they're spending *lots* of money. they're limited by stuff like... there's only one crane in the world that can lift the stuff they need to lift. is musk going to spend all his time building a bigger crane? probably not

[20:51:38] <ggreer> oh and they're limited by regulatory approval. FAA is dragging their feet on approving their next launch: https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/
[20:51:39] <Robomot> SpaceX Starship Super Heavy Project at the Boca Chica Launch Site
[20:51:59] <ggreer> the FAA regulates all launches and reentries carried out by US citizens. not just on US soil
[20:54:00] <ggreer> so even if musk had bought property in south america and built a launch facility there, he'd need FAA approval for launches
[20:56:27] <kuudes> hmm. so arianespace can't hire americans if it does not want to get regulated by FAA?
[20:57:16] <ggreer> all space tech is segmented by nationality. spacex can't hire foreigners due to ITAR
[20:57:22] <ggreer> other countries have similar laws
[20:59:00] <kuudes> yes, but EU is not a country
[20:59:15] <kuudes> and people can be citizens of multiple countries

[21:07:16] <Gurkenglas> ggreer, $6B might be worth more to Musk than the public shame of going back on his word.
[21:07:43] <ggreer> well musk knows the guy is full of shit so his $6B is safe
[21:09:43] <feep> otoh, imagine the public relations benefit of being known as the guy who ended world hunger
[21:10:05] <ggreer> yeah if musk *could* end world hunger by spending $6B, he'd totally do it
[21:10:16] <Gurkenglas> feep, Musk can't eat public relations
[21:10:26] <feep> sure but musk also can't eat six billion.
[21:10:42] <ggreer> but hunger is a political problem. how do you solve hunger in north korea? you have to invade
[21:10:50] <adiabatic> ^
[21:10:54] <ggreer> same for sudan, yemen, etc
[21:11:53] <feep> literally airdrop food
[21:11:56] <PapuaHardyNet> hell yeah
[21:11:58] <ggreer> then most of your food goes to the soldiers
[21:12:03] <PapuaHardyNet> let's invade all these countries to feed their people
[21:12:16] <feep> if they have to be wandering the countryside collecting food, they're not an army anymore
[21:12:17] <ggreer> and you sustain the evil regime for longer
[21:12:21] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, only US will invade. I take my words back
[21:12:29] <Gurkenglas> ggreer, sounds like you haven't applied enough food
[21:13:05] <ggreer> feep: word spreads about an airdrop. the soldiers show up and confiscate whatever the people can't hide in a short amount of time
[21:13:14] <Gurkenglas> wouldn't sudan/yemen/north korea let ships dock if they propose to sell food for very cheap?
[21:13:16] <feep> not like, an airdrop

[21:14:10] <PapuaHardyNet> Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 3
[21:14:11] <feep> the subversive thing about this is that going out to find a food drop is not economically beneficial or tracked
[21:14:15] <ggreer> Gurkenglas: not always. often the food comes in packaging with american flags or "UN helping poor people" or whatever, making it obvious to the starving people that their government isn't providing the food
[21:14:18] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, that is illegal
[21:14:20] <feep> so this is like throwing sand in the country's economy
[21:14:47] <Gurkenglas> ggreer, then remove the flags
[21:14:49] <feep> you're directly competing with the government's monopoly on "not starving"
[21:14:54] <kuudes> north korea is under un economic sanctions, it is illegal to give them anything, including food, without due approval
[21:15:01] <feep> since when does the us care
[21:15:07] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, according to sudan/yemen/north korea?
[21:15:15] <Gurkenglas> oh, okay.
[21:15:18] <kuudes> no, according to the rest of the world
[21:15:25] <feep> since when does the us care
[21:15:27] <kuudes> feep, they are also us sanctions
[21:15:35] <Gurkenglas> sooooo
[21:15:38] <kuudes> this is what winning without firing a shot looks like
[21:15:44] <feep> right I mean, the presumption is this is an us plan because elon is in the us
[21:15:54] <kuudes> well usa won't approve such a plan
[21:16:00] <ggreer> imagine if a bunch of guns & ammo got airdropped in a developed country. cops/military would roll up and confiscate the crates, arrest anyone they caught taking stuff from the crates, talk to informants, make deals with arrestees, etc... to round up those who managed to get away before the authorities rolled up
[21:16:00] * feep shrugs

[21:18:10] <kuudes> they could feed congoese while civil war + ebola + volcano + refugee crisis but not when the refugees run back to active volcano with ebola while being shot at by civil war parties all at the same time
[21:18:11] <feep> ggreer: alright, fair enough, it was a silly idea
[21:18:23] <feep> that said: how do you deal with the fact that if all else fails, china will feed nk?
[21:18:34] <adiabatic> well, they're not feeding it now
[21:18:36] <ggreer> they will? they didn't in the 90s
[21:18:42] <Gurkenglas> dose the food with weed so it'd make ineffective soldiers
[21:18:45] <feep> I'm sure they will rather than allow it to fail

[21:18:59] <feep> oh shit did we? nice.
[21:19:03] <ggreer> most of NK can starve to death and the NK government won't fail
[21:19:14] <kuudes> that was why they negotiated with trump, sort of

[21:19:37] <kuudes> also obama
[21:20:02] <Gurkenglas> permission to make the satelites make us forget about that... thing china didn't do
[21:20:59] <kuudes> but I was surprised to learn that large part of hunger is in india
[21:21:17] <Gurkenglas> do they have price controls on food?
[21:21:25] <kuudes> which sort of has way fewer obstacles on getting people fed than nk etc
[21:21:53] <kuudes> I presume india just does not allow foreign countries to feed its poor people because of nationalistic pride or similar
[21:22:45] <ggreer> northern india is poor as fuck. it's probably hard to transport enough food there
[21:26:40] <Gurkenglas> hmm 100$ rent a month for a one-bedroom apartment, 70 cents for a kg of rice. presumably the poor lose their home before they starve.
[21:27:33] <Gurkenglas> presumably the ones that starve are the ones too dumb for call centre work
[21:28:51] <Gurkenglas> nationalistic pride... maybe it could save face if they officially acquire food in return for cracking down on the scammers
[21:33:22] <Gurkenglas> presumably GiveDirectly is allowed to operate; instead of gifting food which the government can turn away, can't you sneak money to the poor and then they can raise the price of food by buying it and then more foodships will make their way to india all on their own in the usual manner?

[21:48:24] <Gurkenglas> why would it fall into the hands of the government?
[21:48:28] <adiabatic> Gurkenglas: depends on the language and how smart you are
[21:48:43] <adiabatic> and how much you want to, and how much access you have to people who use it
[21:48:59] <Gurkenglas> i suppose being too dumb to learn a language sounds less damning than being too dumb to follow a call center script
[21:49:22] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: you presume a lot - there's a huge diversity of social groups, each with their own history and norms, but a lot of it involves _pride_ as a defence mechanism
[21:49:26] <adiabatic> following a call-center script in your own language is way easier than learning a foreign language

[21:50:43] <Gurkenglas> hot indians might already not be starving, but maybe the caste system helps out here, if they can only find partners among the poor. and also, the government may be less outraged at the lowest caste unlocking a low-end-status job

[22:03:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Eh, that's fairly low on the scale of "bad", in the grand (global) scheme of things
[22:03:47] <kuudes> sure
[22:03:58] <kuudes> though on north european scale it is somewhat bad
[22:03:59] <mst> horse. barn door. bolted. https://developers.slashdot.org/story/21/10/31/0110237/oracles-jdk-17---free-again-for-commercial-use

[22:04:06] <PapuaHardyNet> I am not worried, his parents will probably take him back after he realizes his mistake
[22:04:18] <kuudes> who uses oracle java anymore and not openjdk?
[22:04:52] <adiabatic> people who're on autopilot
[22:04:56] <kuudes> I mean, at work we have had specific witch hunts for anyone using any oracle product when they last changed stuff
[22:04:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: "... under a new "Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions" license." ... so they actually *still* don't get it, lol
[22:05:10] <adiabatic> college students?
[22:05:12] <kuudes> and automatic uninstallers etc
[22:06:11] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, does your friend have a weed plan or a money plan? What's your % that he regrets his decision?
[22:06:55] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: 80%. he talks of marrying her to permanently live with her, hasn't finished high school, and this is the first time he'll be meeting her in person
[22:07:00] <PapuaHardyNet> actually, make it 95%
[22:07:14] * adiabatic passes the popcorn bucket around
[22:07:15] <mst> kuudes: that's what I mean about barn doors, yeah
[22:07:22] <kuudes> indeed
[22:07:42] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: a lot of corporates' legal departments probably won't mind that so much tbh
[22:07:51] <mst> it's still probably too late in a lot of cases
[22:07:53] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, has she expressed an opinion?
[22:08:22] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: yeah, they agreed on this beforehand, of course
[22:08:45] <kuudes> but I guess I have to take it as an achievement that someone is fleeing belgium to finland. usually it is the other way around as iirc belgium had constitutional order on granting asylum to any conscientious objector
[22:09:18] <kuudes> so finland didn't ask for repatriation of people fleeing conscription from belgium because it would have been complicated and awkward if they had to refuse
[22:10:00] <mst> hah
[22:10:03] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, my 50$ to your 500$ that when you ask him April 1st, he'll say that he doesn't regret his decision.
[22:10:06] <Gurkenglas> Deal?
[22:10:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Also, a while ago I picked up a package of Russian "natural food colorings", and today got around to trying one for the first time (the pink coloration of the buttercream rosettes there). It... seems to work at least as well as American artificial-dye based food colorings, and *doesn't* result in the weird oily texture and flavor that you get from the synthetic stuff
[22:10:30] <adiabatic> nice!
[22:10:48] <kuudes> basicly sort of everyone reasonable politicians in finland have agreed that we need to change the translaw so that at least the sterilization requirement is dropped, but it seems that it is hard to get it done either
[22:10:52] <adiabatic> April 1 is always a dicey date for facts. try April 2 or 3
[22:11:32] <Gurkenglas> Dangit, you spotted it. jk. Sure, April 2 works too.
[22:12:49] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: 100$ to my 500$ asking him on April 2. If he says he has any regrets, I win. "no regrets" = you win
[22:13:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: The red one uses carmine. Carmine! Of course, I guess that trades "risk of hyperactivity disorders" for "risk of deadly anaphylactic shock", but what can you do
[22:13:30] <PapuaHardyNet> actually, at that point 50$ to my 500$ is also a winning one. That also works!
[22:17:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> The yellow one uses curcumin (i.e., turmeric). Green, chlorophyll (!) and riboflavin (i.e., vitamin B2). "Peach" color one uses annato. Purple one, beetroot. Then there's a "dry creme brulee" color (wtf?) that uses ... powdered caramel??
[22:18:28] <adiabatic> Just so I understand the verbiage, PapuaHardyNet: "100$ to my 500$ asking him on April 2." means that if PHN's friend says he has regrets, PHN pays Gurkenglas $500. Otherwise, if the friend says "no regrets", Gurkenglas pays PHN $100?
[22:18:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, this stuff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramel_color
[22:18:54] <Robomot> Caramel color - Wikipedia (Caramel color or caramel coloring is a water-soluble food coloring. It is made by heat treatment of carbohydrates (sugars), in general in the presence of acids, alkalis, or salts, in a process called caramelization. It is more fully oxidized than caramel candy, and has an odor of burnt sugar and a somewhat bitter taste. Its color ranges from pale yellow to amber to dark brown. ‚Ä¶)
[22:19:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I just want to say that "The Noonday Demon" is one of the best books I've read on mental health
[22:19:30] <PapuaHardyNet> and depression
[22:20:02] <Gurkenglas> adiabatic, the other way round and 50 instead of 100, although I worry that "any" is too phrasing-dependent, if the question sounds like "is there something you should have done differently?". How about: if he could turn back the clock and stay with his parents instead, would he? Yes -> you win. No -> I win.
[22:20:10] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, sound good?
[22:20:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hah, every regulatory agency in the world deems caramel color to be safe
[22:20:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... except California.
[22:20:44] <gproto23> hey guys. i'm having trouble explaining my knowledge when someone asks me something related with my profession. in some way i can't explain my thoughts with words. i have low confidence. can someone help me?
[22:21:01] <feep> example?
[22:21:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. Is English your native language
[22:21:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. What is your profession
[22:21:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. What is an example of this problem
[22:22:24] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: sure, if he would have stayed with his parents instead of moving to his gf, then that's my winning state, else you do. (100/500 seems more appropriate based on my beliefs though)
[22:22:34] <saturn2> gproto23: what do you think you know, and how do you think you know it?

[22:28:17] <gwern> why make slaanesh's job easy?
[22:29:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Surely the better pun would be "Adeptus Custardes"
[22:30:13] <gproto23> English is not my native language. My profession is security researcher. Example: My friends ask me about security things like "How is secure Tor network?". i am having concern when i explain (i am thinking that "Can I will explain correct?" in my mind) . )
[22:30:36] <feep> well, they don't really want to understand
[22:30:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gproto23: Sounds like the most impactful thing for you to do would be to improve your English
[22:30:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> This will have many benefits, far beyond "better able to explain security stuff to friends"
[22:31:00] <feep> they just want to have an operational grasp, like "police secure, secret service insecure"
[22:31:48] <feep> imo explaining is easier if you keep in mind that people are probably XY probleming you

[22:57:59] <feep> okay nvm question answered
[22:58:19] <saturn2> gproto23: that sounds good enough for me
[22:58:56] <pompolic> what's "XY probleming"?
[22:59:31] <feep> hang on there's a great bash.org quote that illustrates it
[22:59:54] <feep> <glyph> For example - if you came in here asking "how do I use a jackhammer" we might ask "why do you need to use a jackhammer"
[22:59:56] <feep> <glyph> If the answer to the latter question is "to knock my grandmother's head off to let out the evil spirits that gave her cancer", then maybe the problem is actually unrelated to jackhammers
[23:00:44] <feep> ie. a user has problem X, they try to solve problem X in an asinine way because they don't know anything about X. in the course of this they get it in their head that they need a Y to solve X, so they come into a help channel asking for Y.
[23:01:16] <pompolic> ohhhh that
[23:01:18] <gproto23> i am really sorry for taking your time guys. i think i am the dumbest person in the room
[23:01:24] <feep> the help channel now has to 1. deduce the existence of X, which is unmentioned; 2. ask for X without offending the user; 3. solve the actual problem.
[23:01:29] <feep> gproto23: no it's totally fine

[23:51:34] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, the point is that evolution is unfriendly

[23:52:37] <feep> nah, survival
