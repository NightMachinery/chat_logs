To toggle it on in one particular buffer you can just run M-x visual-line-mode <ret>; to turn it on everywhere all the time always, yes, I think adding (setq visual-line-mode t) to your ~/.emacs should do the trick (right?); and you can use hooks to enable it by default in certain types of buffers as you wish, like org-mode

[01:39:32] <kakuhen> e.g. it will warn you against writing (a+b)^2 and recommend {(a+b)}^2, but I've never seen anybody do the latter, and I don't even think TeX itself will modify any spacing if you choose one or the other.

[01:41:13] <bpalmer> Chrome Cases Considered Shiny
[01:41:33] <kakuhen> usually, if you write $(a+b)^2$ in a sentence and it goes over the line, it will place the expression on the next line and use a loot of justify-spacing on the above line

[08:58:37] <Spawns_Carpeting> For some reason emacs is not auto indenting my code for my when hitting tab in c++-mode. Normally emacs will set the proper indentation level based on the level of brackets or whatever it finds, now it just keeps adding indents instead

[09:05:48] <Spawns_Carpeting> I can't seem to find the correct terms to use to search for this issue, I just keep getting results about unrelated stuff. This behavior would result in a line being indented to the correct level according to the syntax of the lang regardless of its current indent level, and pressing tab multiple times did not indent it further if it was in the correct place
[09:05:49] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)

[11:20:19] <wasamasa> I write JS in a very boring style
[11:20:34] <wasamasa> so I'm not sure whether fat arrows allow braces
[11:21:00] <cjb> I'm constantly having to translate US time zones to AU ones, USians most definitely don't share their time in UTC.
[11:21:08] <cjb> chaseleif: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Standard_Time
[11:21:22] <johnw> I try to use the timezone of the person I'm speaking to
[11:21:25] <wasamasa> besides, the announcement does include UTC for people who aren't in India
[11:21:31] <johnw> have gotten very good at thinking in CEST these past couple yeras
[11:21:42] <benaiah> yeah, arrow funcs can have braces
[11:21:44] <wasamasa> including the Indian timezone is useful because it addresses people living there
[11:22:04] <wasamasa> I'm pretty sure that a sizable amount of participants come from there

[11:22:32] <benaiah> i haven't noticed any indentation that i don't like when i use arrow functions with braces, and i don't run into that first situation a whole lot. it's the second one that's more annoying.
[11:23:24] <wasamasa> ok, so if emacs figures out the indentation correctly with braces, then js-mode doesn't figure out that an braceless version is equivalent to that and only goes by braces

[11:39:01] <wasamasa> if a project has peculiar requirements, then the best effort done by your editor isn't good enough and it's better to use an existing tool that understands these requirements
[11:40:28] <benaiah> a reformatter would work for this project, sure, but that's a pretty odd way of indenting JS in general and i'd prefer if every js-mode indented the way i described. it's not a big deal tho, especially since i found electric-indent-inhibit which makes things a lot less annoying when the indentation doesn't match what i want

[13:59:03] *** Joins: drd (~drd@93-39-151-19.ip76.fastwebnet.it)
[13:59:23] <pjb> You also need to move the point within the scroll-margin of the top or bottom of the window for scroll to occur.
[13:59:52] <pjb> Also, it's not clear from the documentation if goto-char is enough, or if you have to move it interactively.
[14:00:04] <dokma> pjb: that's how I verified it doesn't work.

[14:00:10] <wasamasa> I suspect the scrolling happens after the next command
[14:00:32] <pjb> That'd seem logical.
[14:00:48] <wasamasa> which makes testing by evaluating elisp tricky
[14:01:17] <wasamasa> the values are as expected, but something in the command loop resets them
[14:01:21] <dokma> How can it be that in the *Messages* buffer I get a value of 10 but in C-h v scroll-margin a value of 0 ??
[14:01:21] <fsbot`> Ask yourself, do you really want to know?
[14:01:34] <wasamasa> I just gave you a hypothesis, lol
[14:01:56] <wasamasa> for starters, do your testing in emacs -Q
[14:02:09] <dokma> Will try that
[14:02:18] <wasamasa> make sure it's not something in your init file messing with it

[14:04:42] <wasamasa> ,bisect
[14:04:43] <fsbot`> bisect: [0] If you can reproduce your issue reliably in a new emacs, try bisecting your user-init-file

[14:05:19] <wasamasa> bisection should be faster by focusing on the changes to scroll-related display engine settings and modes showing up in said hooks
[14:05:38] <dokma> It will takes some time... will do it

[19:09:22] <twb> wasamasa: it has also rendered the entire book in a single "screen" in nov.el
[19:09:32] <twb> So 30,000 lines
[19:09:36] <wasamasa> yup, there is one per file inside the thing
[19:09:46] <wasamasa> it doesn't render them to separate pages
[19:09:57] <wasamasa> one HTML document is one "screen"
[19:10:05] <rnkn> I'd say because the top headings on those pages are h2
[19:10:05] <twb> pandoc has also trashed the colour in code listings, but has at least preserved the PRE
[19:10:18] <rnkn> there's a pandoc flag to set the top-level heading

[21:02:37] <kensanata> maybe you need to make sure web-mode is loaded? I'm guessing it complains about web-mode-element-child-fold-or-unfold but if you delete that line it will complain about the next one up.
[21:04:11] <kensanata> Or perhaps web-mode-element-child-fold-or-unfold comes from a different file, not web-mode?
[21:06:47] <afidegnum> kensanata: yes, all functions in the key binding are complaining. 
[21:07:04] <afidegnum> what's the web-mode loading syntax?
[21:08:31] <pkal> (require 'web-mode) perhaps?
[21:08:34] <kensanata> Perhaps your :bind is wrong. I'll have to find an example of my own.
[21:08:53] <kensanata> Perhaps you're evaluating it as a variable instead of doing the keymap assignment.

[22:34:18] <nij-> Yeah it's painful to jump to emacs and then talk to emacs. I just need an ivy menu to show up in the center of my screen like rofi does!
[22:34:39] <nij-> Wouldn't that be great? It's lisp, and all keybindings are preserved!

[22:37:01] <nij-> Ivy is a powerful selecting tool (a package in emacs). It provides a framework for me to quickly search through 45000 symbols by fuzzy search (and more!).

[22:37:30] <nij-> rofi is something for X, but it's not lisp and not integrated with emacs yet.
[22:37:56] <didi> nij-: Thanks. I've heard it being mentioned here. I just never tried it. I didn't know rofi however.
[22:39:00] <nij-> didi do you use any distro like doom?

[22:57:09] <nij-> grym: good to know.
[22:57:17] <nij-> I think my goal becomes clearer now.
[22:57:33] <nij-> Given that ivy/helm have treated the internal so well and complete already.
[22:58:08] <nij-> The only issue is to present an X window (on top of everything, centered, as rofi) that contains an emacs miniframe, and shows ivy/helm.

[22:59:02] <nij-> I haven't learned the X protocol and am currently digging into this possiblity. There's an elisp X binder called xelm, on which exwm was built. If someone is familiar with that and could help out, that would be awesome!
[22:59:07] <physikoi> Is `chktex` still the way to go for flycheck checkers for latex? The project page gives no indication of how to configure it any. Also, it hasn't been updated in five years. That on it's own doesn't mean too much. Just trying to understand if i'm configuring emacs well for latex development
