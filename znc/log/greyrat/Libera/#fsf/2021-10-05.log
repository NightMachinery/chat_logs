[02:13:51] <evilpyro> Hello if i use a library that has the AGPLv3 but i dont modify such library and i only call it from my code in a backend server do i need to disclose any code?
[02:17:10] <jxself> Hello.
[02:17:12] <jxself> Whether the library is modified or not isn't really a determining factor.
[02:18:43] <evilpyro> so any software that uses the library needs to disclose its source? I expected only modifications to the library might trigger that
[02:20:00] <jxself> "Disclosing source" is probably not the best terminology. To me that says merely showing someone the source but without any further rights. The best thing would be put your program also under the AGPL as well.
[02:20:18] *** Joins: Gooberpatrol66 (~Gooberpat@user/gooberpatrol66)
[02:20:32] <jxself> With all that that would then entail.
[02:21:01] <yrk> evilpyro: it may be the case that you are modifying it just by "using" it, and therefore triggering the requirement in section 13 of AGPLv3 to offer anyone interacting with the software over a network a copy of the corresponding source code
[02:21:30] <yrk> evilpyro: note the definition of "modify" in AGPLv3 (section 0): `To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
[02:21:30] <yrk> in a fashion requiring copyright permission'

[02:27:22] <evilpyro> yep, but using a library without doing any modification / improvement etc just as part of another software seems more like an exact copy
[02:28:41] <yrk> evilpyro: as in jxself's link: if your goal is to avoid sharing with the community you should hire a lawyer to see how you can get away with not sharing. why in the world would we want to help you not share with us?
[02:29:31] <DiffieHellman> evilpyro: Even if you could get away without releasing under the AGPLv<version>, you should still do so for freedoms sake.
[02:30:03] <yrk> evilpyro: corporations have billions of dollars and football fields of lawyers, we just have our community. it's really weird to ask us to harm the only thing we have

[02:31:35] <yrk> evilpyro: so it really depends on your goal. if the goal is to avoid sharing, expect some respectful pushback here. if you think that the free software community will gain by what you plan on doing, perhaps you are explaining yourself poorly
[02:33:58] <evilpyro> i just want to understand the license tbh, it makes sense to me that if some improvement/modification is performed on the library then yeah, provide a copy of the source, because it makes sense and is the right thing to do. But requiring copyleft on all software while just using an exact copy of it its kinda weird (not that i oppose, its just that if this is the case i wont be able to use the lib and this discards any future investent improving library)

[04:40:33] <Nintendo> Interesting.  That sounds kind of like the Audacity takeover attempt from earlier this year.
[04:41:27] <Nintendo> Or Tenacity, as it's now called.
[04:41:44] <DiffieHellman> Audacity was a bit worse as they wanted to make proprietary software from the source. 
[04:41:51] <DiffieHellman> Sneedacity is a nice for as well.
[04:42:57] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, that nmap licence is shocking, it gives "intellectual property" credibility. 
[04:47:30] <Neopolitan1> CLAs/CAs are proprietary software warning signs. If a project requires a CLA/CA, fork it IMMEDIATELY
[04:48:29] <DiffieHellman> There's an even earlier warning sign; "open source".'
[04:48:52] <notdaniel> That one might be a bit strong
[04:49:00] <DiffieHellman> Nah.
[04:49:02] <Neopolitan1> Yes but that one has more false positives
[04:49:19] <DiffieHellman> If the copyright holder knows what free software is, but stills calls it; "open source", then it's very likely proprietary things are going to happen.
[04:49:42] <notdaniel> what about, say, blender?
[04:49:50] <Neopolitan1> Yes but a fair amount of previously proprietary solutions decide going open source might be good too
[04:50:18] <Neopolitan1> I feel like selling support might be more lucrative than selling the software itself
[04:50:22] <notdaniel> blender has been 'open source' for over 20 years and is still quite free
[04:51:06] <DiffieHellman> notdaniel: They made this statement; https://code.blender.org/2019/06/blender-is-free-software/ so I guess they really don't just call it "open source"
[04:51:29] <DiffieHellman> Sadly they use free (as in gratis) and free and in freedom in the same sentence.
[04:52:24] <notdaniel> While language use is important I think the fact that it's over 20 years old and still %100 libre is more important
[04:53:24] <DiffieHellman> Blender may have some people calling it open source, but they do ensure to name it correctly in some places, so it can be seen that blender won't be going proprietary
[04:55:24] <DiffieHellman> Neopolitan1: When proprietary solutions go "open source", often they just dump some (but not all) code somewhere and proceed to never update such code. It is correct that proprietary software doesn't even make any sense when your business is selling support, but proprietary gotta proprietary.
[04:59:28] <Neopolitan1> wish they said "free in every respect" or something instead
[05:01:41] <notdaniel> I think effort is better spent on actually writing free software than complaining about the language used in software that's already free
[05:02:52] <DiffieHellman> I wasn't really complaining, just mentioning something I noted in the link I just found.
[05:03:09] <DiffieHellman> I do quite enjoy complaining on irc myself.
[05:03:27] <notdaniel> ^likewise :P
[05:04:04] <notdaniel> What are some decent laptops these days? Mine is on its way out :/
[05:04:41] <DiffieHellman> Now that's a hard question to answer.
[05:05:13] <DiffieHellman> Anything "mainstream" made is the last 10 years requires proprietary software to operate fully.
[05:05:29] <notdaniel> indeed
[05:05:36] <notdaniel> I'm thinking maybe a pinebook

[05:07:08] *** Joins: ElPresidente (~ElPreside@108-74-113-129.lightspeed.tukrga.sbcglobal.net)
[05:07:15] <notdaniel> Are there any other freeish devices to be aware of currently?
[05:07:21] <DiffieHellman> Which one exactly? Pinebooks are better than most laptops, but still require nonfree software. Trackpad, keyboard, Wi-Fi and seemingly the GPU requires nonfree firmware.
[05:07:41] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: there have been free drivers for the gpu for years now
[05:08:01] <DiffieHellman> Does these free drivers also include fully free firmware?
[05:08:13] <notdaniel> for all those other peripherals, I'm not aware of any that don't have nonfree firmware yet
[05:08:20] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: yup, it's been reverse engineered by now
[05:08:40] <notdaniel> which is cool because performance is getting quite good on those chipsets now
[05:09:40] <DiffieHellman> ARM is sadly as bad as AMD64 (and sometimes worse) as most often all you recieve for RAMinit etc is signed blobs.
[05:10:08] <DiffieHellman> Provided you were to use a different Wi-Fi chipset, the pinebook looks okay.
[05:10:18] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: the pine products all use uboot
[05:10:21] <notdaniel> I'm fairly sure there are no blobs
[05:10:43] <notdaniel> there are 0 x86 cpus I'm aware of with free firmware
[05:11:12] <clever> notdaniel: from factory, or with user modification?
[05:11:12] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: ath9k chipsets won't be around forever
[05:11:20] <notdaniel> clever: ?
[05:11:22] <DiffieHellman> Not really? Core 2 duo's with libreboot are pretty freedom respecting.
[05:11:31] <clever> notdaniel: id think any pre-management engine era x86 chip with coreboot would have fully free firmware
[05:11:36] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: no way, the blobs are just hidden from the user
[05:12:04] <notdaniel> x86 cpus have microcode to deal with
[05:12:10] <DiffieHellman> The user doesn't need to load the blobs and hopefully such blobs aren't malicious, meaning they can be treated as hardware.
[05:12:29] <clever> notdaniel: the default microcode is usually a rom, so it can just be treated as part of the hardware?
[05:12:38] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: so by making the boot firmware read only any device could claim it isn't nonfree?
[05:12:54] <notdaniel> clever: ^
[05:13:03] <DiffieHellman> ARM is worse in that regard, as ARM sells a core to a SoC producer, without even revealing how that core works, and then the SoC producer makes the SoC.
[05:13:32] <clever> DiffieHellman: and that soc producer adds their own secret sauce, that rarely gets documented
[05:13:34] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: we don't know how any x86 cpus work either except the really old ones people have reverse engineered from the dies
[05:14:02] <Nintendo> What a weird state for the world to be in.
[05:14:10] <notdaniel> yeah
[05:14:17] <DiffieHellman> notdaniel: If it's read only, it can be treated as hardware. Any malicious functionalities are malicious hardware functionalities pretty much. 
[05:14:19] <notdaniel> POWER and riscv are both very promising though
[05:14:55] <DiffieHellman> Up to POWER9 is promising, it seems that POWER10 will be proprietary blobs galore.
[05:14:56] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: so chromebooks that are wired so the boot firmware is read only can claim to have free boot firmware?
[05:15:36] <clever> notdaniel: id say there is a difference between an external rom that can be replaced (or flash with RW tied to ro), and a rom in the cpu itself
[05:15:39] <DiffieHellman> notdaniel: Yes, chromebooks often use coreboot actually. The firmware isn't free per se, but nonfree hardware and nonfree software are different things
[05:15:42] <notdaniel> I think this is a ridiculous exception
[05:15:51] <clever> if the memory is seperate from the cpu, then somebody can still swap that memory out
[05:15:55] <clever> even if its readonly
[05:16:02] <notdaniel> if it's code and it's not free it's nonfree
[05:16:22] <clever> but if its directly in the cpu, you have no way to swap it, only validate that its harmless
[05:16:25] <notdaniel> clever: well that's the case with many 'free' x86 platforms
[05:16:39] <DiffieHellman> It's nonfree, but as it can be treated as hardware, so an exception is given.
[05:16:42] <notdaniel> they have external ECs and such with nonfree software on them
[05:16:46] *** Joins: gordonfish (~gordonfis@user/gordonfish)
[05:17:16] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: anything can be treated as hardware if you try hard enough
[05:17:23] <notdaniel> but it just leaks to absurd workarounds
[05:17:29] <DiffieHellman> Sadly fully free hardware doesn't exist yet (besides a few hand soldered gates), so the only option is just to not use computers if you would like full freedom. 
[05:17:40] <notdaniel> like purism was talking about moving nonfree firmware to a different flash chip so it didn't count
[05:17:49] <clever> notdaniel: what about a case like the rpi, where there is an 18kb rom in the cpu itself, which can then load open firmware from an external chip?
[05:17:56] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: what about the new sifive chips?
[05:18:11] <notdaniel> clever: yeah none of the rpis are fully free AFAIK
[05:18:29] <clever> notdaniel: if you exclude the rom, the pi0-pi3 range can be made fully free
[05:18:31] <DiffieHellman> Not yet, but it's possible to write and load up fully free firmware.
[05:18:49] <clever> notdaniel: i have xfce running on a pi2, with every blob past the rom opened up
[05:18:54] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: yeah I did read about that a while back but haven't looked into it much
[05:19:11] <notdaniel> clever cool, I didn't realize how far that project had gotten
[05:19:11] <clever> pi3 just needs some aarch64 work in the bootloader
[05:19:19] <clever> pi0/pi1 neds the armv6 work finished off
[05:20:11] <DiffieHellman> SiFive mentions "core IP", which means they love the concept of "intellectual property", so I wouldn't doubt they do dodgy things.
[05:20:21] <clever> notdaniel: https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=BQyyVtmmVg8 this would be linux booting to a login prompt with a working /dev/fb0
[05:20:27] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: the source (RTL and firmware) is all there
[05:20:38] <DiffieHellman> Great.
[05:20:39] <notdaniel> they even have a reproducible build for the mask rom on the cpu
[05:20:40] <clever> notdaniel: ive not recorded a new video, but i'm now spinning up a full x11+xfce on that fb0
[05:21:01] <notdaniel> clever: cool
[05:21:13] <DiffieHellman> The problem with RISC-V is that it uses a lax pushover licence, meaning any hardware producer is free to make their hardware design proprietary.
[05:21:25] <notdaniel> DiffieHellman: do you have something better?
[05:21:31] <clever> notdaniel: and for extra points, the 3d core is spinning a triangle in the background, entirely out of linux's control
[05:21:54] <DiffieHellman> notdaniel: No, not yet. I might get around to it in 5 years though.
[05:21:58] <DiffieHellman> *20
[05:23:37] <DiffieHellman> clever: What exactly do you boot? Is this BusyBox/Linux?
[05:24:18] <clever> DiffieHellman: full on nixos, systemd, xfce, a login manager, the works
[05:24:53] <DiffieHellman> Okay, so you boot fully on GNU/Linux, great.
[05:25:24] <clever> DiffieHellman: https://gist.github.com/cleverca22/e9800ed47a9a66d4f1a6d182458cc390 as long as you have these 5 files, it will boot enough to run /init on ext4, you can then swap in whatever distro you want to
[05:25:33] <clever> as long as its a build that can run on armv7l
[05:25:56] <clever> and i can provide directions to build those files from source
[05:26:04] <DiffieHellman> Great, I can't wait to try the real Gentoo (fully libre) on my Pi0.
[05:26:18] <clever> pi0 is armv6, which still has some boot issues
[05:26:35] <clever> last time i tried it, linux would crash in wonky ways when transfering from earlycon to ttyAMA0
[05:26:49] <clever> pi2 can boot fully to a graphical session
[05:26:58] <clever> pi3 can boot fully to a non-graphical session in arm32 mode
[05:27:05] <DiffieHellman> Decent booting speed unlike stock, nice.
[05:27:21] <clever> https://i.imgur.com/Yeh6wEr.jpg
[05:27:31] <clever> DiffieHellman: if i omit linux, i can boot to a command prompt in just 0.6 seconds
[05:28:00] <clever> and still have working ext4 drivers, for loading whatever you want next
[05:28:27] <clever> it could also continue to boot linux in the background, while doing other things
[05:28:54] <clever> so it could do the android/ios thing, where you have an animated boot logo, which can render before linux has even uncompressed itself
[05:30:12] <DiffieHellman> Nice, that boot image would require careful selection of course.
[05:30:43] <clever> https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=u7DzPvkzEGA
[05:31:15] <clever> DiffieHellman: it also has full 2d sprite acceleration, so moving objects around is very cheap, and if you have the animation laid out in ram, flipping frames on vsync is very cheap
[05:31:43] <clever> the glitching in that video, is just due to having too many sprites at once
[05:34:36] <clever> DiffieHellman: once i figure out vertex shaders, i could potentially even go 3d, just to show off, lol

[05:36:07] <clever> notdaniel: the 3d is happening on the VPU side, before the arm core even comes online

[10:59:35] <kompowiec2[x]> Arduino, RTL-SDR, thinkpad... my freedom grows
[11:00:24] <GNUmer> What's really the greatest Firefox-based browser with really good support for WebRTC and most flexibility while the browser itself doesn't have much bloat?
[11:00:49] <kompowiec2[x]> IceCat?
[11:01:15] *** Joins: ferruh (~Thunderbi@192.198.151.53)
[11:01:56] <GNUmer> Icecat is kind of a pain in the ass with constantly trying to fight with LibreJS. Everything I *have* to use doesn't work at all well with LibreJS.

[11:02:49] <kompowiec2[x]> So just add this sites to whitelist
[11:03:12] <twb> Personally I use firefox-esr because it's literally the only GUI browser that Debian provides security support for
[11:03:34] <twb> I hate it but I'm not prepared to roll my own distro, and I can't avoid GUI browsers entirely anymore :-(
[11:04:19] <GNUmer> Ah, my distro does not have IceCat in the repos. Maybe I could use Firefox-ESR with modifications.
[11:04:30] <kompowiec2[x]> I remember some fork FF which still offer XUL. Good for FlashGot users
[11:05:01] <kompowiec2[x]> Ach right, pale moon
[11:05:42] <twb> ff works a lot better now I have >1GB of RAM and allow it write access to $HOME, /tmp, and /dev/shm.
[11:05:49] <twb> (Which I also hate)
[11:07:46] <GNUmer> Pale moon seems like a good project but I hate having to install it separately and update it through a separate tool instead of just updating it through the package manager.

[23:54:58] <hiya> I don't know if I am doing off-topic, but today, I got insulted by an opensource guy who works with .net framework, he told me he respects my love for Libre stuff. He says, he respects that he uses I did pureOS, debian with main repo only, trisquel and stuff. But I could never do libreboot, so I am a half baked product. I don't even use Linux properly. I have btrfs but I won't use snapshots, I don't even backup my stuff with scripts, I just copy/paste. Basically 
[23:54:58] <hiya> after Windows with WSL, I am not creating useless pain for me. As I am not real pro like some of your guys who help me when arch won't boot. [I mean I also research and fix my own things but still, nothing without you]. I am also thinking after being a member of FSF.org etc, and leaving Windows when 7 just came out. Should I go back? As I am not a real GNU/Linux guy.
