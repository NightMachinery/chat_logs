[00:39:51] <catern> I guess so
[00:40:11] <catern> I think my general thought process isn't really oriented around specific anecdotes
[00:40:46] <saturn2> yes, that's part of being autistic
[00:41:00] <catern> it's much based around grand theories with the occasional vague insinuation that I maybe have some evidence for what I'm saying

[00:41:52] <mst> yes, that's part of interacting with allistics
[00:42:17] <catern> "autism" you say? interesting I'd like to hear more about this "autism", tell me about a time you used your autism to make a positive change in your organization

[00:42:50] <catern> (well you see autism is all about, um, focusing on things rather than people)

[00:43:21] <catern> mst: what is part of interacting with allistics? them not calling me out on not having evidence? surely "noticing a lack of evidence" is more autistic-ish
[00:43:40] <mst> catern: that was the point, yes.
[00:43:49] <catern> ah I see
[00:43:50] <pompolic> chinese "x" is pretty close to hungarian "s", which is close to "sh"
[00:44:24] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. perhaps fibbing is hard when you focus on things instead of people

[04:56:22] <Obormot\Gaia> Reading about this thing where some people are "minting" NFTs "of" art made by unrelated other people, selling those NFTs, and then the creator of the art finds out and is like "hey wtf"
[04:56:50] <Obormot\Gaia> Of course the term "art theft" is brought in, which increasingly seems like a sure-fire sign that the conversation is jam-packed with egregious nonsense
[04:58:09] <pompolic> a lot of the conversation seems to be egregious nonsense based on the notion that ownership of the NFT somehow constitutes ownership of what it points to
[04:58:35] <Obormot\Gaia> The hilarious thing about this is... these artists are all like, "wtf, not cool that some dude minted this NFT of my art, adding no value, and getting money for doing nothing and adding nothing, while I, who made the art, do not benefit". But what if the artists themselves did the NFTs? Then they'd *also* be adding no value and getting money for doing nothing and adding nothing... right?
[04:58:48] <pompolic> and there was something about "right clickers" that makes me think even NFT users may buy this? unless it was some media narrative
[04:59:03] <pompolic> that's the other thing
[04:59:26] <pompolic> i think artists have/are/will have been memed into "nft bad because kills planet" stances
[05:00:06] <pompolic> in fact one (1) artist i know was virtue signalling on twitter like "if you are an artist and you mint NFTs i want nothing to do with you"
[05:00:08] <Obormot\Gaia> It's not even rent-seeking. Rent-seeking is when you have some resource, that you maybe didn't create or earn and maybe aren't doing much of anything to maintain or w/e, but you profit by charging people to use it. Which, ok, we can talk about how that is unfair in some sense (setting aside economic efficiency arguments)...
[05:00:09] <pompolic> so gg crab bucket
[05:00:38] <Obormot\Gaia> ... but this isn't even that, because with NFTs, you're not charging people to derive some benefit from the thing you're sitting on, you're charging people for ... absolutely nothing
[05:01:07] <pompolic> yeah
[05:01:58] <pompolic> anyway i think not doing NFTs is explained by artists being influenced by the handwringer peanut gallery

[05:04:29] <Obormot\Gaia> catern: Well, nobody's stopping the artists in question from minting their own NFTs
[05:04:44] <Obormot\Gaia> They can mint as many NFTs as they like, which can be "of" anything they like
[05:05:23] <Obormot\Gaia> People seem to have these wildly fantastic ideas of what is the connection between an NFT and the thing that it's "of"
[05:05:35] <catern> Obormot\Gaia: presumably a second NFT of their art would be less valuable so that's a bit facetious
[05:05:52] <Obormot\Gaia> catern: Not really? Just add "but this one is real, guys"
[05:06:00] <kuudes> well, copyright goes along with the general intent that creators of some target things are entitled to control most any and all lang grab things related to them
[05:06:26] <kuudes> ie the whole "selling copies of piece of music is criminal"
[05:06:38] <catern> Obormot\Gaia: well, if you think that's the case then suggest it to them, but I think that's obviously not going to be the case
[05:06:57] <Obormot\Gaia> I don't think anyone actually cares
[05:07:11] <kuudes> has anyone made NFT of Metallica stuff?
[05:07:15] <Obormot\Gaia> What if there's two different NFTs of some piece of art? How is anyone even going to find out, even
[05:07:39] <catern> it's utterly unsurprising that people don't like NFTs being made of the art they "own" without their consent

[05:07:49] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway I am reading this NFT explainer piece, targeted at artists (and clearly written by, and for, stupid people)
[05:07:52] <Obormot\Gaia> It has bits like:
[05:07:55] <Obormot\Gaia> "The entire allure of NFTs is that they are unique (literally non-fungible) but also that they can be owned and created by anyone. Ethereum’s blockchain is immutable, meaning no one can undo it or recreate the same thing. So once you own, say, a tweet from Jack Dorsey, he can’t get it “back.” And there’s no permission required to create them."
[05:08:01] <catern> pointing out "well actually NFTs don't have anything to do with intellectual property" is a bit pointless
[05:08:07] <Obormot\Gaia> Which is just mind-bogglingly confused
[05:08:24] <Obormot\Gaia> catern: I don't say it's surprising; my point was just that it's hypocritical
[05:08:39] <kuudes> well IP is hypocritical
[05:08:52] <catern> it doesn't seem hypocritical to me, if you buy into IP as a concept
[05:08:57] <kuudes> which is why we have whole political parties just trying to oppose IP etc
[05:09:05] <Obormot\Gaia> THis is obviously different
[05:09:16] <Obormot\Gaia> NFTs don't transfer ownership or rights in any way
[05:09:27] <Obormot\Gaia> So this doesn't have a whole lot to do with IP
[05:09:31] <kuudes> neither do metallica t-shirts
[05:09:46] <catern> IP is a totally artificial concept, you could add "can mint NFTs" to the range of IP rights
[05:09:51] <kuudes> but still metallica sues etc people making and selling metallica t-shirts
[05:10:00] <kuudes> catern, yes
[05:10:06] <catern> and if people seem to intuitively believe that making an NFT should be covered by their IP rights, then maybe it should be
[05:10:07] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: You're still missing my point
[05:10:13] <catern> (again, I think IP is bad)
[05:10:15] <kuudes> hm?
[05:11:43] <catern> haha a rare good xkcd good xkcd 
[05:11:45] <catern> https://xkcd.com/2536/
[05:11:45] <Robomot> xkcd: Wirecutter
[05:12:11] <gwern> at the very least, selling an NFT of art that isn't yours is pretty clearly fraud and a violation of publicity rights. the person believes the NFT you are selling them is endorsed by the artist. and it's not.
[05:12:20] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: Metallica would never make the argument "the seller of this T-shirt is making money off our brand, without providing anything to the customers!" - because that's obviously false, right? They're providing a Metallica t-shirt, which is obviously a valuable and desirable thing: it's literally a physical object, and not just any kind of object but a piece of clothing, which you can wear and look cool and display your love
[05:12:20] <Obormot\Gaia>  of the band etc. The entire problem, in fact, is that the seller *is* providing value, but they have no right to generate that value in the first place - only Metallica does.
[05:12:31] <gwern> in the same way you can't go on TV and say 'Michael Jackson endorses Nike Air Jordan 2021! go buy some now!'
[05:12:48] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: That's true, of course
[05:12:58] <gwern> you also can't sell a NFT of a JPG of 'Thriller' and go around saying 'you want to buy the _Thriller_ NFT? only $500k for the king of pop's greatest'
[05:14:31] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: But with the NFTs thing, the artists are saying "the NFT minter is making money while adding nothing", which of course is totally true, but left unstated is that if the artist were minting the NFT, they would *also* be adding nothing! They just want the exclusive right to scam people out of money via the vehicle of their art; what makes it hypocritical is not acknowledging that it is, indeed, a scam
[05:14:31] <kuudes> Obormot\Gaia, yeah, I agree the "they don't produce value" is useless and weird
[05:14:53] <kuudes> "producing of value" etc is orthogonal to IP
[05:15:27] <kuudes> I don't see NFTs as more scam as printing metallica logo on black t-shirt
[05:15:47] <kuudes> t-shirt is t-shirt and does not change how warm it is when you print the logo, but the desirability changes
[05:16:00] <kuudes> same stuff as autographs
[05:16:22] <Obormot\Gaia> It's sort of like if I were a con artist who ran some door-to-door con game, right, and some new guy in town tried to horn in on my territory, and I was like "Hey! That guy is *conning people*! In *my* neighborhood! He's bilking innocent people out of their money, the scoundrel!"
[05:16:34] <Obormot\Gaia> Like, yeah he is, but so are you, buddy
[05:16:35] <kuudes> an autograph on a sportsball does generally do much nothing to the object itself, but changes it desirability
[05:17:28] <pompolic> are art markets efficient?
[05:17:30] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: The desirability of the t-shirt changes by printing the Metallica logo on it, yes. What's the NFT analogue? The desirability of the [absolutely nothing at all] changes when you affix a Metallica logo onto it?
[05:17:45] <kuudes> but yeah, I guess it would be interesting to see when someone who has some sort of legal identity, made NFT out of some trademarked thing and then the trademark owner sues them
[05:18:15] <kuudes> Obormot\Gaia, clearly people are willing to pay for scrap papers signed by famous people
[05:18:22] <kuudes> and scrap papers are basically nothing at all
[05:18:31] <Obormot\Gaia> Scrap papers certainly aren't nothing at all
[05:18:37] <Obormot\Gaia> They're a piece of paper with a signature on it
[05:18:38] <kuudes> ... ok
[05:18:49] <kuudes> people are willing to pay for famous people to bless them
[05:18:57] <Obormot\Gaia> Now that's more like it
[05:19:17] <kuudes> people are willing to pay for someone claiming to pray for them or put a spell on them etc
[05:19:20] <Obormot\Gaia> But note that that's analogous *only* because you and I don't believe that a blessing does or means anything
[05:19:30] <Obormot\Gaia> Now imagine if blessings were real
[05:19:36] <Obormot\Gaia> And prayers were really efficacious
[05:19:43] <Obormot\Gaia> Then it's not analogous anymore!
[05:19:44] <kuudes> NFTs are signalling
[05:19:54] <kuudes> people are willing to costly signal through NFTs
[05:20:16] <kuudes> and now the question is on who has the right to benefit from other people wanting to signal this way
[05:20:31] <kuudes> I don't see why this is confusing
[05:20:37] <Obormot\Gaia> It's... not confusing
[05:20:40] <kuudes> ok
[05:20:45] <kuudes> I guess I misunderstand you then
[05:20:50] <kuudes> nice, we agree
[05:21:10] <Obormot\Gaia> It's perfectly straightforward, in the same sense that it's straightforward when a drug dealer gets pissed off when another dealer comes onto his street corner
[05:21:25] <Obormot\Gaia> (Actually it's worse, of course, because you don't even get any drugs)

[05:30:05] <mst> saturn2: NFTs aren't meaningfully 'of' anything ... so yes
[05:30:45] <saturn2> so people should mint their own instead of buying them

[05:32:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> For reasons
[05:33:28] <saturn2> oh
[05:34:16] <catern> I think if you make a second it will likely be less valuable
[05:34:33] <catern> also, it's reasonable to want to retain an exclusive right to mint the NFT without actually exercising it
[05:35:56] <saturn2> under neoclassical assumptions the value of a NFT should be the same as the cost of clicking a mouse or whatever is involved in making one
[05:36:38] <PlanckWalk> The value of an NFT is essentially identical to a serial-numbered certificate issued by whoever created the NFT.
[05:36:50] <PlanckWalk> The certificate can say *anything at all*.
[05:36:52] <saturn2> but of course, once again we see that money really isn't about the exchange of goods and services, but about status
[05:37:02] <PlanckWalk> And be issued by *anyone at all*
[05:37:36] <catern> saturn2: hm, one should be able to operationalize that and make a lot of money
[05:37:43] <catern> unless, do NFTs actually need to be marketed?
[05:37:57] <catern> do people just browse the NFT marketplaces and pick random ones to buy?
[05:38:06] <catern> i.e. can I flood the NFT marketplaces with duplicates of existing NFTs
[05:38:20] <PlanckWalk> You can't duplicate NFTs, you can just create your own
[05:38:24] <saturn2> good question
[05:38:44] <catern> PlanckWalk: that's what I mean, my own with identical content
[05:38:50] <kuudes> I have wanted to get into "I make some calculations and someone hands me a money bag containing million euros" business
[05:39:01] <catern> that's a good business to be in
[05:39:03] <saturn2> i'm sure everyone would be very mad, if you did do that
[05:39:14] <catern> saturn2: it would be the perfect anti-NFT praxis
[05:39:17] <PlanckWalk> The content won't be strictly identical, since it will have your creator information instead of theirs
[05:39:18] <saturn2> yes
[05:39:30] *** Joins: nullcone (uid11626@id-11626.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[05:40:07] <catern> hmm
[05:40:41] <PlanckWalk> Plus it costs gas (or equivalent in other blockchains) to create them
[05:40:51] <catern> there are various other places where you can probably flood networks and make them unusuable - tor, TCP, probably there's some way to do this with Bitcoin - but it doesn't actually gain you anything
[05:41:01] <catern> this is an instance where the flooding actually might make you some money
[05:41:19] <catern> (in addition to violating social norms of not-flooding and ruining the network)
[05:41:24] <PlanckWalk> Last I checked the gas cost was valued at ~$200
[05:41:30] <catern> PlanckWalk: can you batch NFT creation together?
[05:41:36] <catern> it costs $200 to make an NFT?????
[05:43:01] <PlanckWalk> I don't know how much the shift to proof-of-stake changes that, since I don't normally follow crypto much.
[05:43:07] <catern> me neither
[05:44:34] <PlanckWalk> yes, Ethereum has expensive transaction costs.
[05:45:04] <catern> yeah from some quick googling it looks like there's effectively a listing fee
[05:45:12] <catern> ironically these platforms seem extremely centralized
[05:45:27] <catern> because it looks like you can't just make an NFT yourself and then upload it for sale
[05:45:41] <catern> which, if you could do that, maybe you could do something cleverly optimized
[05:46:22] <catern> why do they have to spoil my fun by betraying what's supposed to be the core principle of cryptocurrency
[05:46:41] <saturn2> could you make your own NFT-duplicating platform and charge a fee to duplicate anyone else's NFT?
[05:47:41] <catern> that seems plausible, although I wonder if anyone would use it - the people who will spend money on NFTs probably believe in them somehow...
[05:47:50] <catern> although maybe you could market it as some kind of technical advance
[05:48:02] <gwern> ('dutch masters disease')
[05:48:08] <catern> "our proprietary technology makes NFTs fungible again"
[05:48:16] <PlanckWalk> Well, you'd need their private key for that
[05:48:23] <gwern> catern: there's efforts in that direction by fractionalizing NFTs
[05:48:37] <gwern> levine has covered them at some length
[05:48:49] <catern> so much easier to just spam ethereum with copies
[05:49:08] <catern> if you want to short an NFT simply mint a lot of copies and, uh, sell them, I guess
[05:49:09] <saturn2> PlanckWalk: we're just talking about making a new NFT based on the same artwork
[05:49:38] <PlanckWalk> Oh, then sure
[05:49:46] <PlanckWalk> (for some value of "based on")
[05:51:03] <saturn2> there's a huge market in knock-offs and replicas of other stuff
[05:53:02] <med> i wonder sometimes about the future of nfts.
[05:53:07] <med> beyond digital art, etc
[05:53:29] <catern> anyway, if I cared about NFTs (i.e. hated them a lot) then I would do this auto-knockoff site that you suggested saturn2
[05:53:43] <catern> however I don't care, and also by EMH I can't come up with an idea that would make money anyway so
[05:54:09] <med> digital land cadestres seems liek a good use of them or maybe corporate/soverign bonds

[06:07:54] <catern> hmm, EMH makes me suspicious of my own ideas to make money, and EMH also makes me suspicious that profitable finance companies are just laundering insider trading. so therefore I should avoid investing in companies that don't seem to have any mechanism by which they could just be laundering insider trading, since they will just regress to the mean soon. but that's my own idea to make money, so I should be suspicious of it...
[06:08:13] <catern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:08:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's impossible to make money
[06:08:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> If it were possible then the EMH would be false

[06:09:42] <gwern> crypto is a very inefficient market, tho. lots of irrational and ignorant people, often breathakingly little liquidity, extreme difficulty in shorting or any kind of derivative...
[06:10:09] <gwern> if you believe the EMH, then you have plenty of reason to believe you can make money on crypto

[16:15:38] <Robomot> tensorflow/tpu_execute.cc at acee7a64d5042cbcbc4be61114f6359382578632 · tensorflow/tensorflow · GitHub (An Open Source Machine Learning Framework for Everyone - tensorflow/tpu_execute.cc at acee7a64d5042cbcbc4be61114f6359382578632 · tensorflow/tensorflow)
[16:15:45] <nshepperd2> maybe
[16:16:02] <nshepperd2> i am guessing HardwareLayout_HostShapeToDeviceShapeFn is in libtpu, so
[16:18:36] <RiversHaveWings> ooh
[16:19:28] <nshepperd2> but maybe we can write some c++ util that calls that function for us to get an idea how it works
[16:28:23] <shawwwn> That’s actually-genius
[16:28:41] <shawwwn> I forgot, obviously, you can call libtpu.so just like tensorflow calls it
[16:29:14] <shawwwn> And doing that is super easy (because ctypes.LoadLibrary
[16:29:18] <shawwwn> )
[16:29:47] <shawwwn> The trick is, some of those functions might fail unless you duplicate the init routine. But, duplicating the init routine isn’t hard!
[16:32:46] <shawwwn> It’s a “well duh” moment for me (to myself), because if you hunt down libtpu.h and look at the directory it’s in, there’s a client.c file right next to it
[16:33:11] <shawwwn> building it is literally gcc client.c -ltpu I think
[16:33:29] <shawwwn> And it goes through the whole song and dance of allocating a tensor and adding some numbers
[16:33:36] <shawwwn> It even compiles hlo from text
[16:34:08] <shawwwn> So if you’re looking for a simple way to poke a TPU, that would be the best starting point
[16:34:24] <shawwwn> (The exact gcc command is at the top of the .c file)
[16:34:50] <shawwwn> Then you should make a Python lib that does the same thing, because fuck c
[16:35:12] <shawwwn> Watch out tho. I roadblocked myself for two days by being careless with the C conversions
[16:36:01] <shawwwn> I was thinking I could just make Python objects, and return id(obj) as a pointer. Not because that’s valid (it’s not), but because it’s safe as long as tensorflow treats it as an opaque pointer type
[16:36:47] <shawwwn> That’s true for most things, but *not* true for structs, or anything else where it dereferences the pointer. Like, say… TfStatus
[16:38:02] <shawwwn> So I had a nice little “return TfStatus(OK)” in Python, which returned id(that), which tensorflow then happily dereferenced as a struct … without crashing immediately
[16:38:07] <shawwwn> The worst possible failure mode
[16:39:15] <shawwwn> Things kept going haywire, and I kept inventing progressively crazier reasons why it was failing. “Ah yes, it keeps complaining the GIL is unlocked. Tensorflow must be unlocking the gil faster than an FF7 speed runner”
[16:39:50] <shawwwn> Almost convinced myself I needed to rewrite it in luaJIT, since libtpu having a GIL would be a show stopper
[16:40:33] <shawwwn> (Tensorflow releases the Gil to transfer tensors asynchronously. So obviously, if you re-acquire the Gil, it’s gonna freeze the repl forever. Or at least I guess so.)
[16:40:50] <shawwwn> I’m deferring that problem to future-me though
[16:40:57] <shawwwn> Because fuck you, future me
[16:41:03] <shawwwn> Figure it out
[16:41:57] <shawwwn> Anyway RiversHaveWings: yes, I’ve seen functions that have both “Shape” and “Pad” in the name, somewhere inside the TPU internals
[16:42:02] <RiversHaveWings> ahh
[16:42:26] <shawwwn> If you set up a clion environment as described, you’ll no doubt see it quickly
[16:43:07] <shawwwn> Bradbury kept trying to convince me to just implement my own backend rather than literally implementing libtpu
[16:43:51] <shawwwn> Which is a good idea, but only for people who trust themselves a whole lot more than me, in c++ land
[16:44:31] <shawwwn> Writing C was so surreal after not doing it for years. I kept heisen’skilling myself, being both skilled and incompetent simultaneously
[16:44:49] <nshepperd2> heheh
[16:45:03] <shawwwn> I tried writing char* str2 = strcpy(str);
[16:45:20] <kiboneu> good morning fellas

[21:41:29] <adiabatic> yeah, uh, how's the not-macOS support coming?

[21:45:41] <quanticle> Haven't seen an Intel part pull that off for *years*
[21:45:52] <mst> right, but alder lake is also hilariously power intensive and still lags the better AMD chips on a bunch of stuff

My…)
[22:03:44] <mst> it's not a bad summary on the whole
[22:03:49] <mst> except the thing about cranes is kinda dumb
[22:03:55] <mst> but once you scroll past that part the rest is good
[22:04:24] <quanticle> Yeah, and it sort of puts the lie to the FlexPort guy's "one weird trick" approach to solving the port backlog
[22:04:51] <quanticle> And it's like I was saying last week: the problem isn't the storage, the problem is throughput
[22:05:37] <mst> no, it really doesn't
[22:05:43] <quanticle> Like, optimizing the storage at and around the port by getting rid of stacking limits only gets you so far when you don't have enough truckers to move the goods to the warehouses nor enough warehouse employees to unload and repack the goods once they arrive.
[22:06:00] <mst> the flexport guy was constructing a narrative to fix the immediately most fucked up bottleneck that was constraining everything else
[22:08:46] <quanticle> Right, but what I was saying (and still am saying) is that getting rid of the stacking limit is, at best, a very short reprieve. Long Beach has bumped the stack limit to 6, I believe. How long before we've bumped into that? If you fundamentally don't have enough truckers to move the goods from the port, then any means to increase the amount of goods stored in and around the port will be a
[22:08:48] <quanticle> band-aid solution.
[22:09:08] <quanticle> Like great, now you can stack containers up to six high around the port. How long before they bump into that limit?
[22:10:20] <PapuaHardyNet> Bellard implemented GPT-J-6B in C
[22:10:22] <PapuaHardyNet> that's insane
[22:10:29] <quanticle> The problem is that we don't have enough truckers to move goods, and the real root cause of that is that we're all so addicted to our free shipping that we're willing to tolerate delays as long as the price of shipping doesn't go up.
[22:14:17] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: I was more impressed by GPT-2 in C. once you've done that, -j probably isn't that much harder
[22:15:09] <mst> quanticle: the stacking limit will mean more truckers available
[22:15:18] <mst> quanticle: this is still a clear improvement
[22:16:11] <saturn2> quanticle: thanks, i hate it
[22:17:34] <mst> like, yes, one of the constraints on the system is 'availability of trucker+truck' hours. building extra capacity for such inevitably has a lead time, so things like the stacking thing making more of the existing capacity available for use is very much worthwhile
[22:18:11] <mst> it was basically low hanging fruit, except for the 'needing to get the .ca government to actually do something' part, hence the flexport dude committing a politics to deal with that part
[22:19:21] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: what makes me excited is the speed of generated text by bellard's gpt-j versus eleutherai's gpt-j

But I remember noticing that my white friends (not all of them, to be fair) would do things like watch TV for hours after school instead of
[22:36:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  studying. Or argue that happiness was more important than good grades. Or go to parties instead of getting enough sleep to be ready to do your best at school. I remember being shocked when I went to take the SATs and the girl behind me told me that she'd stayed up until 11pm the previous night at a party and hadn't studied or prepared for the exam at all.

[22:40:58] <quanticle> lol
[22:41:06] <quanticle> The limit was in your own mind, gwern!
[22:41:10] <gwern> because I want to see a lot of results, right? and google normally restricts you to something dumb like 10
[22:41:16] <feep> but if I go to num=100&q=boebert, I still get 2550000 results
[22:41:39] <gwern> feep: I don't. but if I remove just 'num=100', then I get 'About 8,890,000 results (0.58 seconds)'

[22:43:37] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: bellard is an inspiration, yeah
[22:43:42] <gwern> I know that's not how it works for other stuff. if I try 'deep learning' I get 'About 2,460,000,000 results (1.10 seconds)' and... 2 pages with 'In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 171 already displayed.' at the bottom. bizarre
[22:44:04] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: "People love to talk about how Asian and Asian American culture's stereotype of the strict disciplinary educational and cultural norms comes from Confucianism.

[22:45:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Anything more automated than that runs the risk of breaking API changes
[22:45:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Maybe the actual culprit is Buddhism!
[22:47:14] <quanticle> Except... India purged itself of Buddhism in like the 12th Century
[22:47:29] <quanticle> This is why you see so many old Buddhist stupas in India
[22:47:34] <quanticle> But so few *actual Buddhists*
[22:48:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I suspect a part of it is a rigid hierarchical culture
[22:49:21] <PapuaHardyNet> people who can ascend social class through a gruelling socially accepted method (like entrepreneurship for the west), are celebrated or even worshipped
[22:49:26] <shawwwn> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28570546 🤔
[22:49:33] <quanticle> One thing I find interesting is that, in the West, the records of religious conflict all survived. Even pre-Reformation heresies are, if not well known, then at least known to scholars. Whereas in India, you have a narrative of, "Oh, we didn't do anything to the Buddhists, we just recognized the Buddha as yet another avatar of Shiva, just like Krishna, and they all happily returned to the fold."

[22:50:40] <quanticle> Until very recently there was no way for anyone to ascend social class through a grueling socially accepted method. Literally, where you were born is where you were.
[22:51:24] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: sure, I agree with you. I fail to see why you say "but have you considered"
[22:51:41] <quanticle> gwern: I know, right? (*shoves the lynchings and beatings of Muslims over cows, "love jihad", and beatings of Christians over their missionary activities among dalits under the rug*)
[22:52:55] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Because in India, until very recently, there was no way to ascend social class. So this idea of "people who can ascend social class via education" didn't exist. No matter how educated you were as a dalit, you were just a dalit and even the lowliest kshatriya would spit on you.
[22:53:39] <quanticle> Heck, that discrimination is here today *even among the Indian community in the United States*: see the lawsuit against Cisco which alleged caste discrimination against a dalit employee.
[22:54:36] <quanticle> But, somehow, despite being so radically different, culturally, Indian-Americans have the *exact same* educational aspirations as Chinese-Americans
[22:57:09] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: right, I apologize. Could you specify what you mean by "educational aspirations" exactly? surely you don't mean the "scholar-bureaucrat-educated-gentleman-type figure"
[22:58:43] <quanticle> I mean the fact that it is a universal expectation among *all* Asian immigrant families that their child will go to college, and graduate with at least a four-year degree, *preferably* in a "hard" field like engineering. Getting a degree in a "soft" field (where even biology is considered "soft") is acceptable only insofar as it is a step towards a future career in a respectable profession like
[22:58:45] <quanticle> medicine or law.
[22:59:19] <quanticle> Meanwhile, even in 2020, the total percentage of US adults with a 4-year college degree stood at ~35%
[22:59:23] <kuudes> personally, I would valuate medical doctors and attorneys over engineers
[22:59:38] <quanticle> kuudes: Yes, that's true
[22:59:48] <quanticle> And it's not incompatible with my statement
[23:00:09] <PapuaHardyNet> that is interesting
[23:00:13] <quanticle> Medical doctors are valued more than engineers, and "soft" undergraduate degrees are tolerated because they're the first step towards that
[23:00:19] <PapuaHardyNet> what is your theory as to why there's such a similarity, quanticle?
[23:00:38] <quanticle> Immigrants are hungry and like to win? I dunno
[23:01:10] <quanticle> But that doesn't explain why not all immigrant communities are like that.
[23:01:34] <quanticle> Like, sticking to Asia, the Hmong immigrants I know are far more tolerant of their kids going into "blue collar" professions like farming
[23:02:01] <quanticle> Whereas if an Indian kid said, "Mom, dad, I don't want to be an engineer, I want to be a truck driver," that would be a goddamn scandal
[23:02:26] <PapuaHardyNet> jews and european immigrants to america, afaik, focused on businesses as a method of getting wealthy instead of educational qualifications
[23:03:05] <quanticle> Eh, Jews also focused on education. Harvard had a quota on the number of Jews it would accept before World War 2 made anti-semitism gauche
[23:03:47] <PapuaHardyNet> I see. But they weren't so obsessed with it as Asians and Indians were right?
[23:04:30] <PapuaHardyNet> but I'm not clearly theorizing if I'm trying to fit the facts to my theory.
[23:04:39] <quanticle> I also think that class has a role to do with it, but not in the way that the thread thinks of it. I think the pre-existing social class of the immigrants has a role to play. The Hmong that came to the United States came over as *refugees*. They were of low social class, even in their home countries. Whereas the typical Indian or Chinese immigrant is either a professional or from a relatively
[23:04:41] <quanticle> high-class background.
[23:04:55] <gwern> quanticle: not even a self-driving truck engineer, or a trucking CEO - a mere driver. why did they bleed for their child for so many decades to come to the USA only to see such ingratitude
[23:05:20] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: here's a better theory: the level of status anxiety determines this
[23:05:32] <PapuaHardyNet> and asians and indians have a high status anxiety
[23:05:44] <quanticle> Like, I was having a conversation with one of my Hmong friends and he brought this up: "So how many servants did your mom's family have in the old country?" me: "Not that many? Only about three." Him: "Yeah, see that's the difference. In the old country, my mom would have been one of the servants."
[23:06:37] <PapuaHardyNet> here's a sidenote but still an interesting question: how do you differentiate between status anxiety and ambition?
[23:06:48] <quanticle> Why do you need to differentiate?
[23:06:52] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd say an easy way to differentiate is to see whether your ambition is cardinal or ordinal
[23:06:56] <quanticle> Ambition is status anxiety
[23:07:42] <PapuaHardyNet> not necessarily. You can want to become like the people you admire without having status anxiety
[23:07:42] <quanticle> You look at the "old money" kids. The ones who come from trust fund families who've had wealth for generations. Is there a lick of ambition among them? No.
[23:07:57] <PapuaHardyNet> darn, you are right
[23:09:33] <shawwwn> gwern: I know you like your e{m,n}dashes without spaces surrounding them—but you have to admit, it looks pretty weird. https://imgur.com/a/FWGcF6H
[23:09:36] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: I think a better way to understand the Asian and Indian immigrant question is to look at the careers they avoid

[23:09:54] <quanticle> Yeah, they're all low-social class careers. 
[23:10:10] <PapuaHardyNet> and high variance careers
[23:10:40] <quanticle> Well, high variance with a floor
[23:10:44] <kuudes> I guess in north europe indian parents can frown earlier, as medical and law universities take all their students in after secondary directly
[23:10:51] <quanticle> You can make a *lot* of money as a programmer, but you'll never be poor
[23:11:49] <kuudes> I have known programmers in finland who have made only 800 e/mo and lived with roommates, but I think there was something wrong with the situation
[23:12:15] <kuudes> but I guess indians generally would not migrate to finland?
[23:12:52] <PapuaHardyNet> how's the immigration policy in finland? I doubt it's liberal enough
[23:13:18] <kuudes> yeah, it is not. you can come to study here if you manage in the entrance exams though
[23:13:34] <kuudes> but student visa does not mean you get a worker visa, which has been criticized
[23:13:48] <quanticle> Well, that's also true in the US
[23:14:03] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "Chinese people and the government have been battling it out over foreign currencies for years. The chinese are trying every means possible to convert the renminbi they have into foreign currencies to preserve the value of their wealth. China's national tv reported on october 29th that the shanghai public security bureau uncovered the first case of a legal exchange of foreign currency using game point cards. To avoid informing 
[23:14:04] <two2thehead> the chinese people of this new method the report has carefully omitted essential technical details. We can only make out the following information the case involves more than 20 people and three online exchange platforms. The value of unredeemed game point cards seized by chinese police amounts to 310 000 us dollars. The total amount involved is up to more than 4 billion us dollars"
[23:14:07] <PapuaHardyNet> US visas suck - all this "sponsor" crap is stupid
[23:14:08] <quanticle> There are a lot of students who have to go back to India because their F-1 student visa expires and they can't get a H-1
[23:14:12] <kuudes> but in usa you can apply for visa while in usa, isn't it?
[23:14:34] <quanticle> >the total amount involved is up to 4 billion US dollard
[23:14:36] <quanticle> Damn
[23:14:38] <quanticle> That's a lot of gold farming
[23:14:49] <kuudes> afaik in schengen you can't apply for new visa without exiting schengen
[23:14:56] <two2thehead> Whenever I read things like this, I'm reminded nearly most of the 'China is unstoppable people' don't know what they're talking about and are only jumping on a bandwagon
[23:15:02] <two2thehead> quanticle, yep
[23:16:04] <quanticle> Well, there's a difference between "China is unstoppable", "The Chinese Communist Party is unstoppable" and "Xi Jinping is unstoppable". A *lot* of people here (especially in certain foreign policy circles) like to pretend that all three of those statements are equivalent, but as you've pointed out, they're not.
[23:16:19] <two2thehead> yep
[23:16:47] <kuudes> but wasn't that that people bought farmed gold with renminbi for over its value and then sold the farmed gold for usd with worse rate, I read?
[23:16:57] <kuudes> ie it didn't need 4 G$ worth of gold farmin

A view from China: governments must turn their attention to the metaverse - by Bruno Maçães - World Game (One of China’s main think tanks has just published a report on the implications of the metaverse for national security, perhaps the first such reflection being produced. …)
[23:19:29] <quanticle> The tl;dr of that is that the Chinese think that the "metaverse" is a plot by "American elites" to entrench the dominance of US firms and the US government in the next generation of cyberspace

[23:21:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I hope all of them get in the way of Meta
[23:21:46] <PapuaHardyNet> the "metaverse" should be the internet, not a walled garden
[23:21:56] <pompolic> the only thing more embarrassing than Meta is its opposition

[23:22:54] <pompolic> but, broadly, when i heard people speaking negatively about it, they jumped to standard dystopian narratives #1984 and #1985 (colloquially Brave New World)
[23:23:02] <pompolic> great
