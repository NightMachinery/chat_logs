[03:19:17] <tincan> heya everyone, having a bit of an issue here and was wondering if someone could lend me a hand

[04:24:37] <biberao> :D
[04:24:41] <bosspotato> so if that thing is true for a given n it's gonna be true for n + 9m for every integer m
[04:24:41] <Nickssen> 1. Base case, show that it holds for the first value.
[04:24:42] <Nickssen> 2. Induction step: Here you assume that the statements holds for a random
[04:24:42] <Nickssen> value, and then you show that it also holds for the value after that.
[04:24:43] <Nickssen> 3. Conclusion, because the statement holds for the base and for the inductive
[04:24:43] <Nickssen> step, it is true for every value.
[04:24:59] <bosspotato> no induction is required and induction is probably unhelpful anyway

[04:28:23] <Nickssen> cherim, do you recall sturm liouville problems? :D

[06:06:45] <Nickssen75> hmph, maybe he got confused D:
[06:06:48] <Cale> constxd: Consider how if you start off flipping anything that ends in a T, you only need to flip HH from then
[06:07:58] <Cale> So it's not independent, because even if you fail to flip THH in the first three flips, your last two flips might be TH or your last flip might be T, and those could be the start of a success.
[06:09:24] <Cale> Or, looked at another way, if your first three flips are HHH, then the second group of three is now known to start with HH and so can't be a success

[08:20:09] <frelleck> no, it's the solution to bx = a
[08:20:19] <qergle> we can further abstract and instead of saying 1/b we can say b⁻¹

[09:13:47] <PamiPetteri> I learned from this channel that most of the numbers that exist are infinite, either irration or irrational and transcendental - they do not create a ratio like 1/3 and neither do they give a quadratic equation nor a polynomial, and they cannot be used except that x-x=0 and x/x=1, otherwise for standard mathematical operations they are useless "as is".
[09:14:03] <PamiPetteri> Cale: true
[09:15:34] <PamiPetteri> a rational number can be expressed as a ratio, like 355/113 is an approximate value of pi.

[09:16:11] <Cale> Depending on how you define the real numbers, you might have different basic operations available to you, but one of the most basic principles that gets used to start building up a library of irrational numbers is something called the "least upper bound property".
[09:16:30] *** Joins: Null_A (~null_a@2601:645:8700:2290:6daa:6a79:97ab:557)
[09:17:15] <Cale> It says that for every nonempty set of real numbers that has an upper bound (i.e. for which we can specify a fixed number which is larger than every member of the set)
[09:18:03] <Cale> (larger than or equal to every member of the set, I should say)
[09:18:10] *** Joins: xiongxin8802 (~xiongxin@119.123.103.94)
[09:18:11] <Cale> that set must have a *least* upper bound: an upper bound which is less than or equal to any other number which is an upper bound for the set
[09:21:48] <Cale> For example, consider the set of numbers x for which x^2 <= 2. This set of numbers is bounded above, because it can be seen that 2 is larger than any such number, using the basic properties of inequalities and multiplication.
[09:22:37] *** Joins: xiongxin (~quassel@119.123.103.94)
[09:23:00] <Cale> But then, this collection of numbers must have a least upper bound, which will turn out to be a square root of 2.
[09:25:07] <Cale> The least upper bound property also gets involved in many of the basic results that underpin calculus, and ensure that things like integrals of continuous functions exist, and one of the ways you're likely to define pi is as twice the integral from -1 to 1 of sqrt(1 - x^2), i.e. the area of a circle

[09:27:01] <Cale> That's probably somewhat unclear, I'm not sure I have time to fully fill out the explanation, it might take a few months of a university calculus course to really flesh out all the details. :)
[09:28:56] <Cale> There are a few different ways to build the real numbers out of more primitive things like sets or sequences of rational numbers, and then once you do that, you end up showing that your real numbers have a bunch of basic properties, the least upper bound property likely being one of them, and then from there, you can build up Calculus and things like logarithms and trig functions and such.

[10:49:36] <qergle> that's right. and it's less than the original pricetag.
[10:50:37] <qergle> because when you take 25% off, you're not just taking off 25% from the original $100 but also from the $25 increased price.
[10:51:13] <qergle> so you add $25 in the price hike and remove $31.25 (25% of 100 + 25% of 25) during the sale.

[13:10:36] <rubiksdream> looking at the product prod_n=2^infinity (1 + a_n), a_n = (-1)^n/sqrt(n), we have that (1+a_{2n})(1+a_{2n+1}) = (1 + 1/sqrt(2n))(1 - 1/ sqrt(2n+1)) = 1 - 1/(sqrt(2n+1)) + 1 / sqrt(2n) - 1 / sqrt(2n(2n+1)) = 1 - 1 /2n + junk, and I think junk is going to be something of order 1 / n^k for k > 1

[13:15:53] <CuriousErnestBro> riv still no idea how Av = λv works though
[13:16:15] <CuriousErnestBro> Why do we get the eigenvectors we get and not a scaled version of them?
[13:16:32] <CuriousErnestBro> because those are also eigenvectors (but not obtained by solving that system!)
[13:16:51] <riv> if v solves that, kv does it too
[13:18:20] <rubiksdream> but im still not entirely satisfies with what I have done, I can show that proving it diverges is equivalent to proving (essentially) sum_{n=1}^{infinity} log(1 - 1/2n) diverges to infinity, but its not so clear to me that this new series does

[13:23:01] <rubiksdream> ah okay, finally, figured it out, so sum_{n=1}^{infinity} log(1 - 1/2n) diverges to -infinity iff sum_{n=1}^{infinity} log(1 + 1/{2n-1}) diverges to infinity, iff sum_{n=1}^{infinity} 1 / (2n-1) diverges to infinity , and by divergence of harmonic series, the final statement is true
[13:23:02] <CuriousErnestBro> riv well, yes, that's what I said, but why do we get v and not kv for some k!=0
[13:23:18] <CuriousErnestBro> or is this a "don't worry about it" thing
[13:24:34] <CuriousErnestBro> What is so special about Null{A-λI) that it removes all the other eigenvectors?
[13:26:15] <CuriousErnestBro> I guess the question is: Any basis of the null space is still the basis when scaled, why do we get the arbitrary scaled vectors that we get

[19:11:55] <bildramer> it's never the right time to sit down and learn all that galois bullshit properly, but I got interested in part of it
[19:12:52] <bildramer> say you have a circle in a degree n polynomial parameter space, and want to see how following it permutes the roots

[19:15:46] <cherim> Your terminology is very unusual, I can't even figure out what you want
[19:15:55] <cherim> What is a circle here?
[19:17:07] <cherim> "circle in a degree n polynomial parameter space" sounds more like you have a family of polynomials with coefficients depending on one parameter
[19:17:08] <bildramer> like say ax^2+bx+c=0, then take a,b,c as 3D space, and specify a circle in that space

[19:17:55] <cherim> And a=a(t), b=b(t), c=c(t) where t is the natural parameter on the curve (circle) in your quadratic example?

[19:20:07] <bildramer> yeah
[19:20:35] <cherim> One thing that is obvious here is that Galois theory is completely irrelevant
[19:21:11] <bildramer> now I'm thinking about how the roots don't really have labels, so how do you specify permutations on them? but when one pair of permutations does 1<->2 and 3<->4 and another does 1<->2 and 2<->3 they'll interact differently
[19:22:06] <cherim> The concept of "one root transforming into other" here is about continuous trajectories when t varies
[19:22:10] <bildramer> well, a bunch of pop math blog posts make it out to be about this kind of thing. I'm wrong then
[19:22:44] <cherim> If you fix some t and mark the roots on the complex plane, typically you will have several isolated points
[19:23:08] <cherim> So you can draw a circle around each so that it's the only root inside that circle
[19:23:31] <cherim> If you now vary the parameter t slightly, the roots will also move only slightly
[19:23:50] <cherim> So there will still be only one root in each of previously drawn circles
[19:23:52] <bildramer> yes. this is why I ask about a closed curve, a circle: if you follow the roots' paths (after labeling them), 0->1 and 1->0 is distinguishable from 0->0 and 1->1

[19:58:38] <pyzozord> But I don't think that is the culprit. I think the real reason is the elusive "problem solving" ability, or maybe puzzle solving
[19:58:48] <pyzozord> I think you guys might be the best place to ask for help
[19:59:07] <pyzozord> How can I learn the right way to think about / approach and solve problems
[20:00:01] <pyzozord> I feel my mind often explodes at the amount of possiblities and just refuses to think further, or I just seem not able to pivot my mindset/point of view in a way to make the problem more approachable
[20:00:13] <pyzozord> can you give me any advice?
[20:01:48] <cherim> Read texts (like https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf), solve non-random/thematic problemsets (like https://cses.fi/problemset/ for that text in particular)
[20:03:16] <pyzozord> That problem with flags is simple: count the peaks by looking at neighbors. Then list distances between peaks. Then prepare frequency map of the distances. Then... And here I have problem. There is some kind of relationship between distances and frequences of distances and I can't figure out what is it exaclty. I always end up missing some edge caseses. And when I fix this edge case previous edge case
[20:03:22] <pyzozord> comes up
[20:04:14] <pyzozord> cherim: thanks. I have few books like this. I don't really think my problem is with datastructures or algorithms. It's something more basic then that
[20:05:01] <cherim> You say the problem is not with programming
[20:05:19] <cherim> But then you describe a problem that is essentially with programming
[20:05:45] <pyzozord> The same problem can be phrased without any programming at all
[20:05:56] <pyzozord> it's more conceptualization of the solution that I have problem with
[20:06:00] <cherim> I.e. having difficulty with correctly keeping the environment when formalizing an algorithm
[20:06:35] <cherim> People avoid troubles with edge cases using good programming idioms
[20:07:26] <pyzozord> Here is another example: I couldn't figure out how to factorize common primes
[20:08:04] <Z-module> You give me any prime in Z, no matter how huge, and I'll instantly give you all of its possible factorizations in Z.
[20:08:10] <pyzozord> I spent an hour and a half with pen and paper, and couldn't get it
[20:08:36] <cherim> Actually, let's go back to the peaks
[20:08:48] <cherim> What do you do exactly?

[20:12:14] <pyzozord> distfreqpref stands for "distanec frequencies prefix" because I'm using a prefix sum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum to know how many flags in total I could get at given distance
[20:14:37] <cherim> To me the brute() part looks meaningful but everything before it just goes nowhere
[20:15:05] <cherim> How are you going to extract the answer from the frequency arrays you build? What's the final scheme?
[20:15:28] <pyzozord> that's the thing I don't know
[20:15:41] <pyzozord> lines 24-30 are experimental
[20:15:53] <cherim> Anyway, we can get to the point pretty fast here, avoiding finding bugs in brute() and the rest
[20:16:01] <cherim> This is a binary search problem

[20:16:32] <pyzozord> https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/10-prime_and_composite_numbers/
[20:16:49] <cherim> Your trouble is that you don't recognize the algorithmic class (binary search over the final answer, using brute force check for each candidate answer)
[20:17:26] <pyzozord> binary search is a lesson 14 and this is lesson 10 so I think there is some other answer

[20:51:49] <isekaijin> Let f(y) = h(y) = 1/y and g(y) = 2/y. Then, for any finite nonzero value of y, the only solution is x = -1. (With multiplicity 2, if you will.)
[20:52:12] <isekaijin> But if you take the limit first, you get 0 = 0, and then any value of x is a solution.
[20:52:37] <drobi> those aren't continuous right?
[20:52:48] <isekaijin> Sure as hell 1/y and 2/y are continuous functions.
[20:53:20] <drobi> y=0?
[20:53:28] <isekaijin> That is outside the domain.
[20:53:36] <isekaijin> It makes no sense to ask whether a function is continuous on a point not in its domain.
[20:53:44] <isekaijin> But, in any case, you can tweak the functions 1/y and 2/y away from infinity.
[20:54:10] <drobi> well I guess my h,g,f, are continous for any value of y
[20:54:31] <isekaijin> As I said, you can easily tweak the definitions of f, g, h away from infinity.
[20:54:51] <isekaijin> So that f, g, h are continuous and defined for every value of y, including 0.
[20:55:41] *** Parts: pyzozord (pyzozord@user/pyzozord) ()
[20:56:19] <isekaijin> For example, if x and y are real-valued, then you could set f(y) = 1/y for |y| >= 1, and then connect the values of f(-1) and f(1) with a straight line.
[20:56:31] <isekaijin> Straight line segment, sorry.
[20:56:47] <drobi> right

[20:58:16] <cherim> Anything with all 3 functions having limit=0 will typically be a counterexample
[20:58:37] <isekaijin> Maybe your functions f, g, h satisfy a much stronger condition? Perhaps they are analytic or even given by polynomials.
[20:58:56] <drobi> yes, they are given by polynomials
[20:59:15] <isekaijin> Okay, then we need to pass to the so-called “projective space” to study the behavior “at infinity”.
[20:59:47] <drobi> for each of the polynomials individually?

[22:13:18] <Guest790> Okay, so let me see if I got this straight. There's some underlying sample space Ω, and random variables X and Y which follow some (maybe known) distribution. P is a function that gives the probability of an event being observed on variables X and Y?

[22:20:23] <qergle> your RV is a map from ω to R (strictly speaking doesn't have to be R but I'm sure it is for you)
[22:20:38] <qergle> sorry capital Omega meant
[22:20:51] <blackfield> Ω is the space of elementary events, ω is some elementary event, then X could be some event which you'd get using set operations over elementary events

[23:16:56] <dk657> ok maybe i'm a bit dim right now. if i have a non-singular n×n matrix A with entries of only 1 or -1, is it obvious what form the solutions to Ax=1ₙ have?
[23:18:24] <dk657> certainly if A turns out to have a constant column, the x which solves this equation is zeros everywhere except the entry corresponding to the constant column, which is 1 or -1
