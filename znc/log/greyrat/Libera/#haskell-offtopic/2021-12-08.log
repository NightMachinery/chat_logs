[23:09:07] *** Joins: Lycurgus (~juan@98.4.112.204)
[23:09:19] <monochrom> Seems like the trend is adding complexity and grind.
[23:09:30] <monochrom> And I mean s/complexity/complications/
[23:10:00] *** Quits: Morrow (~quassel@bzq-110-168-31-106.red.bezeqint.net) (Quit: https://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[23:10:49] <monochrom> It may be just like the 20th-century-and-henceforth movement in classical music. Nice melodies were exhausted, so people started trying random noise.
[23:11:05] <monochrom> and group theory.
[23:11:41] <merijn> monochrom: That's mostly modern big budget games, not games overall
[23:11:46] * Lycurgus doesn't see how that relates to the incredibly infantile world of video games
[23:11:54] <merijn> monochrom: Also, different kinda frustration
[23:12:24] <monochrom> Unfortunately the human auditory system does not actually recognize group actions on motifs, so doing group theory in music composition remains a paper-only academic pursuit.
[23:12:29] <merijn> Sure, the games EA/Ubisoft/whatever are frustrating, but, like, intentionally so to push microtransactions and I just avoid those games
[23:13:51] <Lycurgus> maybe consumer culture is infantalizing by nature and/or hostile to critical / sophisticated thinking
[23:13:51] <janus> what's wrong with group theory?
[23:14:25] <Lycurgus> in music composition?
[23:14:54] <Lycurgus> wrong kinda melody
[23:19:18] <merijn> Somehow my "complaining about my own ineptitude combined with shitty hitboxes" turned into gatekeeping music, I do not approve >.>
[23:19:40] <merijn> Especially any gatekeeping that implies classical music was somehow the pinnacle of anything >.>
[23:21:53] <monochrom> It is not like I was approving the academic music I was describing either.
[23:23:45] <Lycurgus> actually compared to other art, serialism, 12 tone and the like were relatively sparse in srs western music
[23:23:50] <monochrom> I can also talk about trends of pop, rap, heavy metal music that I also disapprove, if you like.
[23:24:43] <monochrom> Nice melodies were exhausted, so people started trying monotonism, swearing, and just being very loud.
[23:25:03] <monochrom> and naked dancing.
[23:25:20] <Lycurgus> i missed that
[23:25:24] <merijn> As far as I can tell none of the pre-1850s composers in the west managed to find any of those nice melodies :p
[23:26:05] <awpr> as relevant as it's ever going to be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iXmfOE2o5Q
[23:26:09] <dminuoso> merijn: Try listening to some beethoven
[23:26:38] <merijn> dminuoso: Beethoven is ok
[23:26:49] * Lycurgus .oO( prolly ugly naked peoples )
[23:27:10] <monochrom> If you correct me by s/were exhausted/were thought to be exhausted/, I will agree, actually I may like to make that correction myself.
[23:27:59] <monochrom> Nice melodies have definitely not been exhausted yet. But people looking for an excuse to invent random things ought to find an excuse.
[23:28:22] <merijn> People claiming Beethoven is better than all modern music is at best some sad-ass intellectual gatekeeping and at worst a poor understanding wtf music is
[23:29:02] <dminuoso> "Better than" is so subjective anyway.
[23:29:42] <Lycurgus> who needs gatekeepers when you have dummy down and unrelieved mass idiocy?
[23:30:54] <merijn> Of course it subjective, which is why claiming that is a sign of intellectual gatekeeping and snobbery I don't approve off
[23:31:46] <Lycurgus> snobbery means you don't like brittany or rap igess
[23:32:15] <merijn> You can dislike whatever the hell you want, but why you gotta pretend whatever you like is "better"
[23:34:03] <Lycurgus> better aesthetically is required otherwise ur not making sense and in any other way, who does that? Hyacinth Bucket?
[23:34:36] <merijn> There's such a strong correlation between narrow music tastes and narrow-minded takes on what's good music and "holding up classical music as better than modern music" that my opinion of your music taste AND my opinion of you lower whenever someone argues that "classical music is better than modern music"
[23:34:50] <Lycurgus> if you like a thing you think it is better aesthetically
[23:35:29] <merijn> Lycurgus: People (almost) never argue "I like classical music better". It's nearly always "classical music *is* better"
[23:35:38] <dminuoso> I like death metal as much as I like Beethoven or Rachmaninoff.
[23:35:46] <dminuoso> Just depends on my mood and concentration.
[23:35:47] <Lycurgus> merijn, maybe where you live
[23:36:13] <monochrom> Actually I do have a bit of discrepancy between what I like and what I think is good.  The movie The Hours is good, but I don't like it.
[23:36:14] <merijn> Lycurgus: Also online
[23:36:35] <Lycurgus> and that's probably only true for a people just breaking out of adele and brittany
[23:36:55] <Lycurgus> even the use of "classical music" is telling
[23:37:09] <Lycurgus> when it doesn't refer to the 18th century
[23:37:09] <merijn> Brittany?
[23:37:13] <Lycurgus> Spears
[23:37:20] <merijn> Britney, but sure
[23:37:37] <merijn> Lycurgus: Who said classical being 18th century?
[23:37:53] <monochrom> I could s/classical/serious/ if you want. I thought no one knew the term "serious music". I ought to try to speak your language.
[23:38:16] <monochrom> or s/serious/art/ if you have further objection to gatekeeping wording
[23:38:24] <Lycurgus> i'm referring to referring to serious western music as "classical" beyond the actual classical period
[23:38:34] <dminuoso> Lycurgus: The term classical music is ambiguous, it has two different meanings.
[23:38:39] <geekosaur> that's still gatekeeping probably
[23:38:51] <monochrom> But seriously "serious music" does not carry snobbery connotation unless you have an insecurity complex.
[23:38:53] <dminuoso> Assuming that its use is telling is somewhat snobbery
[23:39:01] <Lycurgus> yeah "serious" is hella gatekeeping
[23:39:12] <dminuoso> "classical music" is something different than "classical era"
[23:39:15] <geekosaur> and so is "art"
[23:39:27] <merijn> Pretending there's a hard definable line between "serious music" and the implied "non-serious music" already makes me think less off people :p
[23:39:33] <awpr> re "if you like a thing you think it is better aesthetically",  no.  I like the chaotic train wreck sections of Rivers of Nihil.  I sure don't think they're better in any universal aesthetic sense than something pretty like Jupiter, Bringer of Jollity.
[23:39:57] <Lycurgus> i think less of unforced typos
[23:40:53] <Lycurgus> holst came to detest the planets btw
[23:40:54] <geekosaur> and as for aesthetically better, I like a lot of music. Not all of it is either aesthetically or technically better
[23:41:33] <geekosaur> and there is music I don't like which I consider either aesthetically or technically better, just not my thing
[23:42:13] <awpr> to take a page from Robert Pirsig, quality is the interaction of a thing and the person experiencing it, and not inherent to the thing.  ordered chaos where I have to work to tease out the structure is pleasing to me.  that doesn't make it better, and that doesn't require me to think _it_ is better independently of my own experience
[23:42:55] <Lycurgus> all preferences that aren't based on reason are based on aesthetics, meant the latter term in that, um  sense
[23:43:30] * Lycurgus had pirsigs book in college aesthetics course at IIT

[23:50:24] <monochrom> Honestly I don't know why the hell gatekeeping and infantization were brought up. I just know I didn't do it.
[23:50:55] <monochrom> Should I believe it was "OK someone said 'classical' so let's patronize them?"
[23:51:44] <awpr> well that was a pretty hilarious music video.  I'm not totally sure whether it was meant to be, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt
[23:52:59] <merijn> monochrom: The infantilisation comment was Lycurgus and I dunno where that was coming from, but you stated pretty explicitly "all nice melodies were exhausted" and "so people resorted to monotonicity, being loud, and crude", which sounds pretty gatekeep-y to me
[23:53:41] <monochrom> Fine.
[23:54:17] <Lycurgus> i think you have conflated gatekeeping (the supposed quality stuff) with bashing (the trash)
[23:54:20] <monochrom> But said something else earlier that gave you a much better picture of what I think.
[23:54:34] <Franciman> using haskell is gatekeepy too nowadays, but I see nobody arguing it's bad
[23:54:53] <monochrom> <monochrom> It may be just like the 20th-century-and-henceforth movement in classical music. Nice melodies were exhausted, so people started trying random noise.
[23:54:53] <monochrom> <monochrom> and group theory.
[23:55:16] <Lycurgus> so now were getting more understanding on 'gatekeeping'
[23:55:16] <monochrom> Did that make you think I'm a gatekeeping kind of person? Seriously?
[23:55:43] <monochrom> Because I was obviously bashing that kind of academic pursuit right there.
[23:55:45] <Franciman> honestly the "nice melodies" thing is already surpassed in beethoven lol
[23:55:48] <geekosaur> trying group theory is not exactly a new idea in music. see Bach
[23:55:57] <Franciman> nice melodies is a gift of some
[23:56:07] <Franciman> mozart and cajkovskij spring to mind
[23:56:28] <Lycurgus> the opposite of gatekeeping I would have thought was inclusiveness/being inviting but starting to sound like it's being simple minded or tasteless
[23:56:41] <merijn> Franciman: Wow, you didn't have to murder transliteration like that xD
[23:57:08] <Franciman> if it's your transliteration doesn't mean it's everybody's ;)
[23:57:34] <janus> merijn: which cyrillic transliteration system are you shilling? o_O
[23:57:47] <Franciman> this is so typical ahahah
[23:57:51] * geekosaur is assuming that is what Americans normally spell Tchaikovsky?
[23:57:53] <merijn> monochrom: I'm not saying your a gatekeeping person, but those are pretty absolute statements :)
[23:58:15] <Lycurgus> cajkovskij disambigs/googles as the received romanization
[23:58:18] <Franciman> he is not the only one doing absolute statements
[23:58:41] <Franciman> like you pretending everybody say your favourite transliteration of cyrillic
[23:58:49] <merijn> hmm, I thought the Dutch, German, and English ones were the same, apparently not :p
[23:59:18] <Lycurgus> the americans that have occasion to say/spell Tchaikovsky
[23:59:38] <Franciman> there is also the easier ciaikovski lol
[23:59:49] <Franciman> or Čajkovskij
[23:59:53] <merijn> Tsjaikovski :p
[23:59:58] <Franciman> kek kringy
