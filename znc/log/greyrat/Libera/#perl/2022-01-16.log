[03:20:29] <Macwinner> Hi, I have installed a perl module that is published to CPAN via cpanm.  I forked the git repo for the module and have made some changes.  Is there an easy/proper way to make cpanm or my environment load my forked version from git?
[03:20:55] <Macwinner> like with npm, I am able to point to a git repo.  Wondering if there is something similar with cpanm
[03:21:30] <Macwinner> or is the best way to clone the repo locally and "use lib ... "
[03:26:26] <El_Che> cpanm supports git
[03:26:32] <El_Che> check the docc

[03:28:22] <Macwinner> do you need to uninstall the main module before doing this?

[07:08:48] <simcop2387> one thing that'd be really cool today is that you could use an esp8266 to give wifi to a palm pilot pretty easily.  i did it back in highschool with two cybikos and a custom program (just shuffled serial port connection through their "network")
[07:09:18] <simcop2387> an esp8266 + ppp on a raspi would work wonderfully for a palm pilot, it'd look just like a modem with their default AT firmware

[07:22:43] <zgu> then you've got lots of bridges... i like being able to configure one ovs bridge like a managed switch and attach any physical or virtual interfaces to it
[07:24:08] <simcop2387> i guess if i had to create or manage lots of new ones constantly it might make sense, but this way i just tell the VM which one it's on.  you get a more central management of it then?
[07:24:44] <simcop2387> ok host machine is updated with new qemu... i think i'll just let this crash again instead of manually rebooting it.  i did make some changes that *might* affect it
[07:26:18] <zgu> basically. there's a single bridge (you can have others if you want but usually don't need to) and each port attached to it can have its own tagging. can also do bonding/LACP
[07:26:56] <simcop2387> lacp/bonding might be a good reason to do that then.  i've not needed to do that and probably won't need to ever.
[07:27:34] <zgu> you can just specify the vlan tag in the libvirt config instead of having multiple different bridges exposed to libvirt
[07:27:42] <simcop2387> at least from this server, i do lacp between two of my switches (both mikrotik) so i can get more bandwidth between the 24port 1gbe switch and the 16 port 10gbe switch.
[07:28:46] <simcop2387> i've got it all split between multiple host interfaces to balance some traffic needs (originally didn't have the 10gbe port at full speed, just had 3 1gbe ports)

[15:56:59] <LeoNerd> Your foreach line has the abs() call, but the splice doesn't. I suspect that means you've got your subtraction the wrong way round
[15:57:25] <LeoNerd> Presumably scalar(@data) is _bigger_ than $cols, so you're trying to splice out the first few items until it's the right size?
[15:57:34] <LeoNerd> You probably meant to do  scalar(@data) - $cols
[16:00:51] <gamo> that's it. Thanks!
[16:01:06] <LeoNerd> :) It's a common mistake - I do it all the time
[16:01:30] <LeoNerd> My usual way to trim an array to some size, is actually just to   shift @data while @data > SIZE;

[18:38:19] <aquanight> 05:31:35/3AF2F < LeoNerd> My usual way to trim an array to some size, is actually just to   shift @data while @data > SIZE; ### splice @data, 0, -SIZE;

[18:40:58] <aquanight> hmm, would be neat to have array rotation operators I think.
[18:42:31] <aquanight> I mean, you can do it with push @x, splice(@x, 0, N); or unshift @x, splice(@x, -N); but it'd be nice to be able to do it in a single operation.
