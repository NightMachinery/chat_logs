[01:51:08] <edgar-rft> Restarting the image resets it to all its builin bugs.

[02:04:09] <White_Flame> well then the patches you apply to your stock image should be loaded up by your init lisp scripts

[05:20:09] <hayley> Hm, it's more that they want literally everyone who touches their code to be a "customer" and pay them.
[05:20:48] <gilberth> Yes, but they don't believe in their business model and rather work for Microsoft.
[05:22:37] <hayley> Apparently so. Though if I mention it, I apparently will sound like some 90s free software nerd who just got over the Halloween documents.
[05:22:57] <gilberth> lol
[05:23:43] <hayley> They can put whatever prefix before the name, it is still a mutation of "open source", for better or worse.
[05:24:56] <hayley> Complaining about Microsoft became uncool some time in the mid 2010s AIUI.
[05:25:08] <gilberth> Well, technically "open source" just means that some could see the source.
[05:25:45] <gilberth> In this regard Windows is open source.
[05:27:07] <lotuseater> I'm sure we could ask Dave Plummer.
[05:27:33] <hayley> You mean prsWHDavPlmmr?
[05:28:40] <gilberth> Well, our uni had the sources for Windows NT back then. Not that that would have been useful in any kind in a pure UNIX environment.
[05:30:04] <hayley> idk, I thought Windows was "shared source". Which this new license kinda is too. The main difference, I guess is that an open source license lets you redistribute (under any license, so it isn't transitive still), and the work tends to be publically available too.
[05:30:37] <gilberth> Otherwise I never engaged in this anti-MS war of sorts. You are not obligated to use their stuff.
[05:31:24] <hayley> I don't really care for it, but I found it funny that a "Microsoft advocate" or whatever is dictating how open source development should go.

[05:35:06] <gilberth> Milady, you're getting paranoid here.
[05:36:27] <hayley> I believe that the damn "movement" rests on a mis-information campaign about programming already, so it would fit.
[05:37:44] <gilberth> WHat makes you think that this mis-information is intentional and by not knowing better?

[05:41:54] <hayley> No, many do. And that's why I think they would think they can get away with it, as there are fewer of "us".
[05:42:11] <gilberth> Heh. Stick your head together and you're meta-circular.
[05:42:36] <moon-child> somebody recently said they hid the version number of their web server, so that people wouldn't target it with version-specific exploits
[05:42:57] <hayley> Can't be that many versions?
[05:42:58] <moon-child> I said, hackers will target your nginx server with apache exploits.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[05:43:00] <gilberth> And that helps?
[05:43:35] <gilberth> It's always funny to seek all those wordpress exploits being attempted at my CL-HTTPD.
[05:44:19] <gilberth> see, rather.
[05:44:36] <gilberth> You notice pretty fast when there is some new exploit.
[05:45:07] <hayley> i.e. some (lambda (arguments ...) body ...) = (object (define (value arguments ...) body ...)), you can kinda guess how let/lambda works, letrec is harder but roughly (letrec ((n v) ...) body ...) = (value: (object (define n v) (define (value) body ...)))
[05:45:45] <hayley> I invented the syntax for pure message passing in S-expressions, but it is hopefully not too alien.
[05:47:07] <gilberth> Though I must confess, that I patched MAKE-PATHNAME for the famous %2E%2E exploits. Silly idea, that CMUCL let me construct a pathname with a ".." component.
[05:49:13] <moon-child> hayley: no y combinator?
[05:49:54] <hayley> moon-child: OBJECT and sending to SELF lets you do recursion already.
[05:50:28] <moon-child> yeah but with _way_ fewer style points

[07:25:36] <hayley> gilberth: Would you like a toy program to gaze at my accidental^Wgenius pure-messaging-in-S-expressions syntax design?
[07:27:43] <gilberth> Sure, what does the toy program do?
[07:35:30] <moon-child> if, for some reason, I wanted to make an s-expression syntax that could be translated to lots of different languages, I _would_ use #t/#f.  Because #f can be losslessly converted to nil; but given a nil, there's no good way to know whether to convert it to () or #f
[07:35:35] <moon-child> why you would want such a syntax, though, I have no idea

[07:43:54] <gilberth> Well, consider how nice hacking could be, when it wouldn't come up with new syntax every day. As we not only have HTML, XML, CSS, but micro-syntax everywhere for attribute values. There would be way less fragile flipping between external and internal representation.

[13:35:20] <kakuhen> the intent to make a minimally function program to get pcm samples out of a flac and then find a way to play them back

[14:19:01] <kakuhen> dunno, it just works :3c 
[14:19:36] <kakuhen> on windows, if your sound card has ASIO drivers then you're good to go for most serious audio tasks

[15:11:48] <pjb> kakuhen left, but Apple technical decisions are based on hard facts and statistics on the installed base.  If they don't use C++, it's because they're measused that it was way more costly (energy-wise) than C, when running on the billions of iPhones and iPads. Basically, using what they use, make them provide half an hour or an hour more battery time.
[15:13:02] <selwyn> i wonder if apple does anything in quantum computing
