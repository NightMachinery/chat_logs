[23:01:51] <bullgard4> Does the abbreviation "SO" stand for "significant other" in https://wiki.debian.org/GettingHelpOnIrc? "Although many channels deal with small talk about the weather, girl/boy/SO friends and politics, there are IRC networks and channels that are dedicated to provide support for software or an operating system."
[23:02:37] <blkshp> SO, yes, in the correct context.
[23:03:59] <bullgard4> blkshp, Do you mean "SO, yes, in this context here."?
[23:04:40] <blkshp> I do not. I meant what I said but your statement is also valid.
[23:05:09] <bullgard4> blkshp, Thank you very much for your help.
[23:05:18] <blkshp> Any time :)
