[00:49:30] <epilys> does this replace the macos init as well or is it just service manager?

[00:50:16] <dsc_> wasnt systemd modelled after the init system Mac OS already had? :P

[00:56:01] <indigo> Heh, AVX512... good luck with power consumption when you use that
[00:56:15] <netbsduser> good evening. InitWare does not and can't run as the primary service manager on macOS - without significantly hurting the functionality of macOS - because launchd is also responsible for several macOS-specific roles, like acting as the Mach bootstrap server and maintaining namespaces
[00:56:48] <cot> Huh, interesting
[00:57:49] *** Joins: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud)
[00:57:57] <netbsduser> it is also able to do what systemd calls "socket activation" (which in systemd and thus initware really is a more general mechanism that can work with many kinds of file descriptor) with Mach port names. and as of macOS 10.10 it's proprietary and was totally rewritten with several new APIs

[01:01:56] <netbsduser> a meme has spread throughout the net that launchd was nothing but systemd's forerunner and that systemd and launchd are basically the same thing. it's basically a load of nonsense except launchd really did pioneer the concept of preopening resource handles (mach ports and FDs). and launchd relies on this alone to correctly order startup

[12:52:35] <gerikson> man I am old
[12:53:03] <jj5> gerikson: lol, I thought the same thing when I heard Linux is turning 30... I am old. :P
[12:53:05] <pnoud> Are you older than Linux?
[12:53:09] <nur> yes
[12:53:13] <jj5> oh yeah
[12:53:13] <pnoud> That's pretty old.
[12:53:21] <pnoud> I am also older than Linux
[12:53:25] <jj5> get off my lawn
[12:53:25] <nur> I remember reading about it when it first got announced
[12:53:37] <nur> and finally getting a chance to try it in 1997
[12:53:55] <gerikson> yeah I installed it for the first time around that time
[12:54:31] <nur> and in 1999 I installed it on my own PC, because before that I didn't quite have a computer to try it on (had an old 486 which was half-dying)
[12:54:55] <nur> man what am I doing with my life, I should write an operating system too.
[12:55:06] <nur> I mean, I am, but I should work harder on it.
[12:55:26] <gerikson> does the world need a new OS
[12:55:28] <gerikson> debatable!
[12:55:45] <nur> the world doesn't _need_ it, but that won't stop me
[12:56:31] <pnoud> I wonder when my first Linux was.  I think it was mandrake.  Not sure when.  On some whitebox I got for free if I promised to "learn computers and do something with it".
[12:56:49] <nur> the first linux I _tried_ was, lol, get this, SCO
[12:57:02] <pnoud> Would have been turn of the century.  Maybe 2001?

[12:59:00] <nur> bitter in retrospect
[12:59:19] <pnoud> sweet at first but bitter aftertaste, yeah.
[13:00:06] <epilys> nur, was it server or desktop/workstation?
[13:00:12] <pnoud> Sure is a good thing there was never more drama with linux after that.
[13:01:31] <nur> I don't remember.
[13:01:46] <nur> my friend set it up at a computer lab, and X11 was set up _wrong_
[13:01:56] <pnoud> What?  Is that even possible?
[13:02:16] <nur> you don't remember syncing the X/Y axis frequencies of your monitor?
[13:02:25] <nur> in your XFree86 config?
[13:02:25] <pnoud> X11 is so simple!  It's just razor blades and nails.  How hard can it be?
[13:02:40] <wink> to be fair, when did even interested people reasonably hear about linux?
[13:02:42] <wink> not in 1991
[13:02:48] <wink> it's simply no comparison to today
[13:02:57] <Irenes> I do, in fact, remember figuring out the monitor frequencies lol

[13:04:10] <pnoud> My 2020 MBP takes about 15 seconds to show a login prompt from sleep.  Sometimes it just reboots.  Pretty sure it is trying to figure out my monitor settings.  Every. Time.  Hardcoding a config file sounds kinda nice actually.

[13:33:51] <dsc_> my macbook 2018 is a worthless excuse for a laptop but at least the people around me in the starbucks think I am cool
[13:34:22] <dsc_> some keys broke down after 1 year of usage (butterfly keyboard)
[13:34:35] <dsc_> it is a terrible machine.
[13:34:56] <pnoud> I had a 2017?  It was the worst laptop I ever used.  And I worked for Dell.
[13:35:40] <dsc_> I like those cheap-ish dell lattitudes
[13:35:52] <wink> I don't love my dell
[13:35:58] <wink> but it's 'OK'
[13:35:59] <pnoud> Great for holding down desks
[13:36:24] <wink> let's just say I could've gotten many worse work laptops
[13:36:29] <wink> it's no thinkpad but it's ok
[13:36:31] <pnoud> The nice thing about working at Dell was part availability.
[13:36:41] <pnoud> Keyboard crapped out?  Fix it yourself!
[13:36:49] <pnoud> (this happened mid-ticket)
[13:37:11] <pnoud> Thinkpads are no Thinkpad anymore.
[13:37:42] <wink> my last one from 17 was still ok
[13:37:51] <pnoud> I think it's hit or miss by model.
[13:38:44] <wink> I have/had x230, T460p, T470p - all fine
[13:39:05] <wink> but ok, so 4y ago was the latest
[13:39:27] <wink> and the T460p is still in mint condition, I'd work with that
[13:39:40] <pnoud> Maybe I am projecting the generic Lenovo laptops onto the Thinkpad line.
[13:40:37] <pnoud> I had a R-something(?) that was built like a swiss dumptruck.  IIRC it was the last IBM Thinkpad.
[13:40:42] <wink> I think I never even touched on of those, so I am biased from the other direction :)
[13:40:51] <pnoud> Then I had a T60 which was fine.  I still have it actually.
[13:41:19] <pnoud> Fan is noisy.  I think I have a spare somewhere.
[13:42:25] <pnoud> I'm honestly considering trying the whole year of the Linux desktop thing.  MacOS is just too unreliable to be more than a terminal.
[13:43:12] <wink> I don't see a problem with that, but why would I, after so many years :P
[13:43:18] <polve> pnoud: which distribution and DE are you considering?
[13:43:21] <wink> and other still say it's not doable
[13:43:30] <pnoud> polve: no idea.  Whatever my IT department suggests.
[13:44:04] <pnoud> So probably Ubuntu.
[13:44:34] <pnoud> For DE I prefer something that has the same keyboard shortcuts it had 15 years ago.
[13:45:47] <pnoud> Post-Covid I kinda wish they would just give me a proper desktop computer.  I only move my laptop when I need to open the lid after a reboot.
[13:46:43] <polve> I never open the lid, just dock it at home or in the office
[13:47:09] <pnoud> I have a mac so it requires a ritual if anything abnormal happens.
[13:47:29] <polve> docking has been the single most revolutionary thing to happen to my computing experience :^)
[13:48:16] <pnoud> Rebooting with the lid closed doesn't actually reboot.  It just shuts down and gets stuck in a low power mode.  Sometimes I have to unplug the USB-C cable.  Sometimes I just have to open the lid and hit the power button.  Sometimes I have to open the lid and hard boot.
[13:48:27] <pnoud> In a way I am already running Linux.
[13:49:18] <polve> ahah well, not really
[13:49:19] <pnoud> Docks are great when they work.  I had a 2014 RMBP and Apple Display with Apple Keyboard and Magic Mouse.  It was _awesome_.  Everything Just Worked(tm).
[13:49:37] <polve> in Linux that stuff is very easily managed by editing /etc/systemd/logind.conf
[13:49:53] <polve> well, the systemd-bearing distributions, at least
[13:50:03] <pnoud> On Mac is is easily managed by, uh, not having any options at all.
[13:50:44] <pnoud> There probably are options but lol if you think I am going to be a MacOS system admin.  The whole value proposition is that it just works.
[13:51:20] <pnoud> If I have to do anything more advanced than change my scroll direction I'd rather just go to Linux.
[13:51:45] <pnoud> This assumes Linux can do stuff like connect to the VPN and send emails and stuff.
[13:51:48] <polve> I agree completely, I feel there's not a lot of merit into tinkering with Apple products
[13:52:20] <pnoud> They'll just change it all with the next release anyway.
[13:52:47] <pnoud> Then lol @ you when your settings worked in Catalina but now you can't close Messages in BigSur or something.
[13:52:53] <polve> on the other hand, to a certain degree you'll probably have to tinker more than you'd like on you Linux system
[13:53:04] <pnoud> Yeah but probably not more than once?
[13:53:13] <pnoud> It's not like my Mac is reliable
[13:53:48] <pnoud> Plus Linux DEs don't have design teams.
[13:54:32] <pnoud> I'm old enough that stability is the only feature I really care about.  And by stability I mean don't change it.  I know it is on fire, I like it that way.
[13:57:36] <wink> everyone has their own perception of often or not often
[13:57:43] <wink> but if I didn't have this horrible docking station...

[13:58:11] <wink> my real "linux problems" with a work computer have been like "fix something twice a year", for the last 10 years
[13:58:27] <wink> and that was many years of Debian testing and equally many years of ubuntu LTS
[13:58:46] <polve> when I started working at my first job earlier this year, part of me kind of wished they'd force to use a Windows machine
[13:58:53] <pnoud> MacOS has been getting more troublesome in every release for the last few years.
[13:59:04] <wink> so currently I am having problems with having to replyg monitors and headset. but my coworkers on windows also have those, so it's the docking station
[13:59:32] <pnoud> polve: you don't want that.
[14:00:09] <pnoud> wink: I just have a monitor that supports USB-C.  Seems to work pretty well.
[14:00:15] <polve> I know but I kind of wanted to see how I could adapt to MS stuff in a productive environment
[14:00:26] <pnoud> You can't
[14:00:32] <pnoud> You can adapt or be productive.
[14:01:17] <pnoud> I can't even tell what buttons are in Windows anymore.
[14:02:10] <polve> I would have ended up using mutt inside WSL anyway
[14:02:49] <pnoud> Oh yeah WSL.

[19:08:06] <comewer> I don’t have an account, so I’ll come here to be delightfully cranky. As follows:
[19:08:53] <comewer> Titles like “The most underused browser feature” that don’t tell you the feature they’re talking about are clickbaity and I don’t click on it.
[19:09:03] * wrl notes this down in the "complaints notebook"
[19:09:13] <comewer> :)
[19:09:27] <river> comewer++
[19:09:48] <wrl> agreed but also just about the best thing you can do when encountering clickbait is ignore it
[19:10:16] <comewer> Another good option is complaining.
[19:10:28] <comewer> It also lets people think “I’m not the only one”
[19:10:36] <comewer> Or “I hadn’t really thought about it”
[19:10:59] <river> ignoring it doesn't wrork
[19:11:00] <comewer> Or “I might do that by accident, even, but now I’ll try not to”
[19:11:41] <river> clickbait cant be bargained with, it cant be reasoned with, it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear, and it absolutely will not stop... EVER, untill you are dead!
[19:12:03] <river> s/dead/click on it/
[19:12:41] <river> clickbait is one thing that you absolutely need top down moderation against to stop, it can't be managed by the users
[19:12:52] <gwozniak> comewer: and to pile on, it's also not a good article
[19:13:44] <gwozniak> It could be condensed into, "I use reader mode"
[19:15:48] <comewer> I also generally avoid links whose titles begin with "how I" because it feels like they read some article to snag something in human psychology.

[19:32:07] <cb> suggest is used to tone down clickbait titles, but it's hard to get people to agree on what would be a better title automatically
[19:33:27] <cb> pushcx: my go at it "Inflammatory (i.e. flamebait for those who don't even read the article) or suggestive (suggesting more substance than there is on low quality submissions) titles.

[20:55:13] <mykolav> Hi everyone!
[20:55:13] <mykolav> Hopefully, messages like this are OK in this channel. Terribly sorry, if not!
[20:55:13] <mykolav> I wrote a toy compiler, and would be really grateful if someone can submit a link to the project to lobste.rs.
[20:55:13] <mykolav> Here's a page that describes it in detail: https://mykolav.github.io/coollang-2020-fs/
[20:55:13] <mykolav> And this is the repo: https://github.com/mykolav/coollang-2020-fs
[20:55:14] <mockturtle> [ A toy compiler of a Scala subset ] - mykolav.github.io
[20:55:14] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - mykolav/coollang-2020-fs: Cool 2020 compiler implemented in F# ] - github.com
[20:55:15] <mykolav> The project was purely for fun and to other people it's, honestly, just another toy compilers.
[20:55:17] <mykolav> But there are a couple things that set it apart.
[20:55:19] <mykolav> 1) It compiles down to x86-64 assembly. Then invokes GNU as and ld to produce a native executable. To me personally, this is much more rewarding than emitting MIPS asm and using an emulator to run it.
[20:55:22] <mykolav> I also prefer emitting asm to emitting, for example, C -- at the very least, it forces the developer to figure out converting expressions into asm. That really drives home the point how much work high level langs do for us.
[20:55:25] <mykolav> 2) The is small but not too small. A lot of mini-compilers have languages with functions, primitive values and pretty much nothing else. Whereas this project's lang has classes, inheritance, virtual dispatch, and even a very simple form of pattern matching.
[20:55:31] <mykolav> 3) The write-up describing the project. At the end it contains a number of links to awesome compiler-learning resources. Every major topics is covered only by one or two links. Obviously, I had to make this section opinionated, but give it a chance, it might click for you too.

[21:52:42] <c355e3b> I feel like if you are going to do that, you are better off going with Apollo at this point
[21:52:48] <creature> So, I want to know more about those issues. To make sure that if we _do_ undertake this work, we end up in a better place & not just a different place. And also because I have some guesses what common pain points could be, but would like to know if that's accurate.

[22:31:46] <gwozniak> Did a comparison of building binutils/gcc of our Arm toolchain (no libraries) between the M1 and a Ryzen 3400.  The build on the Ryzen machine (on Debian 11) took 3m26s. On the M1 machine it took 2m55s.
