[05:21:56] <ckot> ugh. Sorry if any of this is github-specific. I'm trying to figure out just how my intern created a new github PR which contains all of the commits from their previous PR (which had just been merged into main about an hour previous) in addition to their new commits. Does this sound like it might be easiest to just cancel the PR, reset the HEAD or
[05:21:56] <ckot> perhaps rebase the branch, push out the proper commits and generate a new PR?

[05:33:05] <ckot> Vaelatern thx for getting back to me. I *think* what happened is that in their original PR(93), I had to push out 2 additional commits to fix some things before merging it into main.  Additionally, they had 1 or 2 local commits on that same branch *since* they pushed it and generated that PR.  I'm guessing that rather than doing a git pull which
[05:33:06] <ckot> would have pulled down my original commits, they did a 'git pull origin main'. Then they made a few more commits, pushed to remote and generated PR(94).  Before I go ahead with your suggested fix, does my hypothetical intern behavior sound consistent with the problem I'm seeing?
[05:34:03] <Vaelatern> are your commits in the PR?
[05:34:57] <ckot> yeah, my commits were in PR 93 and now they're listed in PR 94 along with all of PR 93's other commits
[05:36:03] <ckot> typically my team uses short-lived feature or hotfix branches, but the intern forgot the workflow over the winter break
[05:38:28] <Vaelatern> so long as they didn't check out from upstream/master, they could have caused the observed behavior

[05:47:58] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@187.223.209.255)
[05:48:32] <ckot> ok. yeah, sorry if I'm not very git-savvy.  rebase on local branches is really clear to me, and perhaps I'm confused, but I thought you shouldn't use it on published branches because it changes your local branches git history and might screw up other users local branches if they do a git pull.  am i wrong on this?
[05:49:09] <Vaelatern> you should not rebase published branches, that is correct
[05:49:18] <Vaelatern> but would you consider the branch used for a PR "published"?
[05:52:15] <ckot> good question. it's not like we're using it for collaboration, but it is currently setup as the remote for both my and her local branches.  should I just delete this remote branch, rebase my local, and then push out a branch just for the PR and be done with it?
[05:53:32] <Vaelatern> If you delete the remote, github will close the PR
[05:53:38] <Vaelatern> but if you push -f then github will adapt
[05:54:15] <ckot> ok. i'll look at the manpage regarding push -f so as to not take up more of your time
[05:56:23] <Vaelatern> it's the same as regular push, but it ignores the remote's state and forces it to match local
[05:57:38] <ckot> i just did git push --dry-run -f   and the only output I was was "Everything is up-to-date".  oops I guess I forgot to rebase first :)

[10:23:58] <Jdeep>  *	If there is not a Git directory to work on, abort.  If there
[10:23:58] <Jdeep>  *	is a work tree, chdir to the top of it if the command was

[10:59:19] <Gustavo6046> so I have two separate repositories. in the other one I wrote a feature, which was kind of a build system, which I figured would be useful to isolate, so I put it in the 2nd repository
[10:59:29] <Gustavo6046> but this means that the 2nd repository has unrelated history to the 1st one!
[10:59:37] <Gustavo6046> how do I merge new development in the new repository back into the old one?

[11:10:06] <Gustavo6046> osse, this "build system" is a small collection of files that orchestrate build in a small project, https://github.com/Gustavo6046/MushMatch

[14:49:19] <Swahili> I end up using remotes/repositoryName/branch, previously I did repositoryName/branch but that didn't seem to work for some reason.
[14:50:20] <Swahili> e.g. git checkout -b remoteRepo/branchName remotes/remoteRepo/branchName
[14:50:31] <Swahili> I'm going to test without the "remotes" just for sanity check
[14:50:53] <crs> Your first command worked fine. It's just that your local copy diverged from its remote sibling. Maybe check it out to different branch locally? Or use gh tool.
[14:50:54] <Swahili> oh, it did work afterall
[14:51:23] <Swahili> crs: thanks for the feedback, that helps! Yeh I probably failed somewhere, so strange, really thought I did this before, let me check history

[15:17:27] <Guest31> I am not able to upload a screenshot of the manual
[15:18:01] <Guest31> The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first parent of each merge. The commits are:
[15:18:01] <Guest31>     I is the initial commit, in which foo exists with contents “asdf”, and a file quux exists with contents “quux”. Initial commits are compared to an empty tree, so I is !TREESAME.
[15:18:02] <Guest31>     In A, foo contains just “foo”.
[15:18:02] <Guest31>     B contains the same change as A. Its merge M is trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents.
[15:18:03] <Guest31>     C does not change foo, but its merge N changes it to “foobar”, so it is not TREESAME to any parent.

[17:14:38] <teut> osse , what was the way to move master to the front?
[17:14:49] <teut> fast forward rebase something
[17:15:04] <Swahili> Q: I've got a `main` branch which is the main branch for all releases originated from `develop`. In `main` there are some computations such as the release process, bumping the version in files etc. From time to time, I merge main -> develop, to keep track of release changes (changelog, version bumps). So, created a PR where I merged main -> develop, and somehow the original `main` was deleted from the remote repository. What could
[17:15:04] <Swahili>  have happened?
[17:15:29] <osse> teut: yeah that's the problem. the easiest way to do that is to use git merge
[17:15:38] <osse> which is weird
[17:15:40] <Swahili> I expect the `main` branch to be intact. I did rewrite history, in the develop branch, where I changed the order where the merge happened to be more inline with the time I released in the main
[17:16:15] <teut> ya , I forgot that, there was a way though
[17:17:03] <teut> I dont code for a while and I even forget the things which I did a lot  few weeks back

[17:19:52] <Swahili> and I did it through the github interface, which has that, so that's what happened. Should've done through the cli.

[17:20:39] <Swahili> mackerman: yeah Github.
[17:20:40] <mackerman> Probably would have also happened if not merged not using the web UI
[17:21:12] <Swahili> mackerman: I thought this was a good idea, but I'll remove that option.
[17:21:45] <Swahili> Otherwise, I guess I could just cherry-pick the release changes in `main`, but from what I understand other people just simply merge back to develop to get the release on track
[17:22:23] <mackerman> Or,  rebase the  develop branch  and make that a PR

[19:10:32] <setuid> Morning! Is there an (easy) way to walk through every previous commit of a single file, and aggregate the overall changes (additions, removals) to specific sections of that file?

[19:12:16] <setuid> Right, but then I have to mentally add/subtract as that file progresses over time
