[07:49:18] <Hash[m]> drmpeg: When I’m looking at the output from gr-iqlevels what should I aim for when looking at data going in to the USRP B200 or any SDR?
[07:50:21] <drmpeg> It just has to be less than +/- 1.0
[07:51:28] <drmpeg> The two numbers on the right should always be zeroes.
[07:52:54] <drmpeg> Some folks will say that you should go a little less, like 0.9. But I've verified that the B210 is linear up to +/- 1.0.
[07:53:25] <drmpeg>  I got a picture somewhere.
[07:56:02] <drmpeg> https://www.w6rz.net/ramp1.png
[07:58:54] <drmpeg> I forgot what gain setting that was at. Probably 78.
[07:59:17] <drmpeg> In general never go over 80.
[08:06:06] <drmpeg> BTW, that's with the Rigol in zero-span mode.
[08:26:00] <Hash[m]> Wow, I was overdriving the hell out of the B200
[08:26:48] <Hash[m]> Can’t really go wrong with a Rigol the more I read about it, you don’t have a need for the Real-time RSA model?

[18:46:28] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, 3 MHz realtime BW and the lowest offer i see on ebay is 1.9k€ (Shipped from the US) - certainly more frequency range, but i don't know the software
[19:04:51] <Hash[m]> Yea, guessing it was used for cable tv industry perhaps? Lots available all the time

[20:37:11] <jsallay[m]> Any suggestions for how to get a b200 usrp to not drop samples? I've increased the priority of the flowgraph and played around with the num_recv_frames parameter.  I'm trying to process 8Msps and not overly taxing the cpus, but I get an overflow every few hours.
[20:47:32] <DerekKozel[m]> USB is really challenging for that, but that's a very low sample rate. A capable computer and USB 3?
[20:47:59] <DerekKozel[m]> I think the most successful I've seen is when someone used the Realtime Linux kernel and was able to run for days.
[20:48:18] <DerekKozel[m]> Do you absolutely need to drop 0 samples, or is it about keeping absolute time consistency?
[20:48:27] <DerekKozel[m]> Could you zero-stuff the dropped sample time?
[20:51:11] <jsallay[m]> I am looking for time consistency.
[20:54:28] <DerekKozel[m]> OK. I've used zero-stuffing for that before. The USRP Source emits an rx_time tag after each overflow so it's possible to calculate the number of samples missing and insert fake data in.

[21:01:09] <Hoernchen> but why would such a low bw overflow?
[21:01:44] <jsallay[m]> Thanks Derek. I was probably most worried that I was setting something up wrong.
[21:05:51] <jholtom> memory contention
[21:05:56] <jholtom> bus contention
[21:08:04] <jholtom> its not hard to get a USB controller to not handle that timing constraint
[21:08:11] <drmpeg> Also Linux processes firing off. Stuff like apt updates are killers.

[21:15:56] <DerekKozel[m]> jsallay: There's options for improving things, but with rapidly increasing levels of difficulty. The RT Linux option was shown with the B200 to keep the full 61.44 MS/s stable for at least 24 hours IIRC. There was probably more tuning, but I wasn't involved with the actual test.
[21:16:27] <DerekKozel[m]> On a mixed user system I've always done a bit of tuning and then opt'd to implement some kind of error handling for overflows/drops
