[01:31:17] <Lumine> It's a showcase basically
[01:31:23] <Lumine> A temporary site though
[01:31:26] <ProfSimm> Lumine: I legit tried to enter text commands into it
[01:31:27] <ProfSimm> :D
[01:31:37] <Lumine> lol
[01:32:10] <Lumine> And the amazing part is, it's only a bunch of HTML files and couple of xmls
[01:32:11] <ProfSimm> Lumine: I've thought about this. A minimal site with 80s 90s feel and a text command line
[01:33:13] <Lumine> Well why not
[01:33:38] <ProfSimm> Lumine: another thing I wanna see is a site that is just bunch of zoomed out pages and you click one and it zooms in.
[01:33:49] <ProfSimm> Lumine: and that's basically navigation throughout
[01:34:21] <ProfSimm> Lumine: so many ways to do a web site, and we've ignored them all
[01:34:28] <ProfSimm> Lumine: so nice to see experimental takes.
[01:35:09] <Lumine> Well, the setup of it was very minimal, fortunately
[01:35:18] <Lumine> Hugo is pretty dang cool
[01:35:19] <ProfSimm> Lumine: minimal is good
[01:35:20] <ProfSimm> :)
[01:35:57] <ProfSimm> Lumine: we need to maybe have a law that sites should be 64kb compressed. That's it
[01:36:24] <ProfSimm> We'll be shocked how much ingenuity and simplicity will flow out on the web

[17:34:41] <Jong> If you had to choose between judicial misconduct or a civil war, which would you choose? Isn't that the choice made in the Dred Scott case?  For the word "person" to be used consistently, it would exclude blacks. To include blacks would be to alter the meaning. And altering meaning is equivocation, the trick of sophistry.
[17:36:02] <Jong> For the law to have reliability, the meaning of the words tomorrow must be the same as the meaning of the words today. If the meaning is different, then the law has effectively changed.
[17:36:34] <Jong> If no new legislature has passed and the law changed, then that's judges changing law on their own.

[21:15:34] <Delf> What makes one weak, xx?
[21:16:09] <xx> unable to live in the world without having someone else protect you or your rights makes one weak
[21:16:13] <xx> unable to take a joke makes one weak

[21:17:04] <Delf> Those are the characteristics of the weak. Why are they unable?
[21:17:35] <xx> because they don't want to
[21:18:00] <Delf> So their will is what's making them weak? Or their lacking will to be strong?
[21:18:46] <xx> it's all about willpower
[21:20:05] <Ungwelian> That's a lie told by the privileged.
[21:21:25] <Delf> Why are you spoiling it for me, Ungwelian?

[21:23:46] <Delf> Why does some have more willpower than others, xx?

[21:26:19] <xx> all I know is that there are weak people who are not content with being weak but don't do anything to change it, and then there are those who do something to change it
[21:26:47] <brigand> or die trying
[21:26:53] <xx> sure, why not
[21:27:16] <Delf> That's alright, as long as they don't actually manage to change it :P
