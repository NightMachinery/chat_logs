[00:53:06] <Decker>  being in the neighborhood isn't the same as getting to the right address... Some of the similarities I saw, were because I missed adding a letter though, so even natrual quaternions don't work the same...

[03:46:18] <Decker> I don't really know why an axis related to a frame results in a different frame, sinca all the points in that frame around that axis shouldn't even change; so that orientation should be preserved.   If the 'Y' axis of the frame described by Q (by rotating (1,0,0),(0,1,0) and (0,0,1) vectors by the quaternion) was along the 'r' rotation, then the frame would spin around just that Y axis...  but if the q frame was in some other orientation, then it's still
[03:46:18] <Decker> relative to that Y axis (? it's not though, because to get the rotation for a yaw() , you'd rotate (0,1,0), and use that as the axis to rotate around.  so a vector to rotate around a Y is always different depending on the original rotation too
[03:48:03] <Decker> and, with the cross product inverted, to rotate around that Y I have to inverse rotate it...
[03:48:04] <Decker> 								 const localAx = this.applyDel( {x:ax,y:ay,z:az}, -1 ); return finishRodrigues( this, 0, localAx.x, localAx.y, localAx.z, spin+twistDelta );
[03:48:55] <Decker> which 'this' is the quaternion being rotated around ax,ay,az;   otherwise I'd just use ax,ay,az which is the vector that is the Y axis

And then there's this forumla which quaternions (are related to? are based on? is another interpetation of?) which give me even a smooth

[04:29:03] <mycroftiv> zeroc00l0: i see this kind of thing described in how models are produced but im not sure what the best specific language is

[05:17:48] <[itchyjunk]> i would assume its some type of volume in a 4 space?
[05:17:53] <isekaijin> Basically, we need to find the interpretation of f(x) dx. (Then we add lots of these infinitesimal things.) But I'm not seeing a sensible interpretation of this quantity.
[05:18:02] <xiaguan> its kinda like work
[05:18:20] <isekaijin> The problem is that f(x) is a rate *per unit of time*.
[05:18:27] <xiaguan> is the pipe straight?
[05:18:32] <[itchyjunk]> oh i guess "area under the curve" is only good if you're working in real spaces
[05:18:36] <Decker> that'd be square meters but really volume per meter

[05:18:41] <[itchyjunk]> the interpretation would change for complex plane
[05:18:41] <Decker> which is m^2 not m^4
[05:19:05] <xiaguan> are there any singularities in the steam density?
[05:19:28] <cuppajoeman> So no physical quantity could represent it right?
[05:19:28] <isekaijin> Notice that, since we are not integrating w.r.t. time, the value of the integral is still a rate per unit of time.
[05:19:32] <[itchyjunk]> Idk, i would say do the integration and let those physicists worry about intepretation of what it all means

[05:20:22] <xiaguan> not over the length
[05:20:35] <xiaguan> like if mmm/s is energy, you are talking about work
[05:20:43] <isekaijin> Maybe you missed the word “totalized” immediately before “over”?
[05:20:56] <xiaguan> no i think i just didn't understand "totalized over"
[05:21:26] <isekaijin> f(x) is a quantity measured at a specific point on the pipe.
[05:22:05] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[05:22:07] <isekaijin> You split the pipe into lots of infinitesimal segments. Call the length of each segment “dx”. Then you multiply “f(x) dx” on each segment, and add all of those quantities.
[05:23:46] <Decker> actually the first length is a red herring ? what's it matter where the gauge is?
[05:24:07] <isekaijin> So really the problem is to find an interpretation for f(x) dx, but I'm not sure I can find a useful one.
[05:24:36] <greenbagels> it's probably some intermediate calculation used in another calculation to get a physically useful qty back out
[05:24:44] <isekaijin> Probably.
[05:25:02] <Decker> well without x it's hard to add a dx ? maybe

[05:26:10] <greenbagels> "flow rate per unit time per unit distance" or something

[05:26:48] <greenbagels> shrug
[05:26:51] <isekaijin> If you have a pipe and you take a cross section, it makes sense to say “this is the volumetric flow through this cross section, in m^3/s”.
[05:27:01] <greenbagels> agreed
[05:27:19] <Decker> andit doesn't matter where along the length that is... it cold be at L
[05:27:23] <Decker> could
[05:27:43] <isekaijin> But why on Earth would you want to multiply this times the length of an infinitesimal portion of the pipe containing the point at which this cross section is taken?
[05:28:18] <Decker> because the other part of the difference is at 0 where presumably there's 0 volume per second
[05:29:24] <Decker> :)
[05:30:16] <isekaijin> Aha. If you do the cross section thing that I mentioned before, it makes sense to consider the *instantaneous* flow through this cross section, in m^3/s.
[05:30:42] <isekaijin> But if you want to compute the flow through the whole pipe, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to talk about the instantaneous flow.
[05:31:05] <Decker> it's volume in the pipe
[05:31:19] <isekaijin> You talk about how much liquid (or gas) flows through the pipe during a finite interval of time.
[05:31:38] <isekaijin> And this meant that you have to integrate over time.
[05:31:46] <Decker> it's how fast the pipe section gets a new content
[05:32:02] <Decker> in units of length
[05:32:11] <isekaijin> Yes, that makes sense for the cross section, but it doesn't make sense for the whole pipe.
[05:32:38] <isekaijin> But if you're integrating over the length of the pipe, you're computing a quantity associated to the whole pipe, not to a particular cross section.
[05:32:52] <Decker> well if you have 1 m and 1 cubic meter, ... but you really have 4m, you have 4 cubic meters of flow across the whole section
[05:33:54] <Decker> flow per meter still though
[05:34:00] <isekaijin> You're not really being precise, but I'll try to find an interpretation of what you're saying.
[05:34:21] <Decker> :) don't :) you're on the same track ... but maybe subst in some unit values

[07:10:39] <mycroftiv> because just watching videos and reading articles you can get a feel for things, but its not like really doing the details
[07:10:50] <mycroftiv> and that is what is harder without a real teacher

[09:30:32] <ESphynx> Is it really true that if I have 3D triangles A and B projected in 2D seen from an Eye, A obscures B if and only if A intersects the tetrahedron formed by B and the Eye? (i.e. a point in A is also a point inside the tetrahedron)

[09:33:43] <isekaijin> Oh, a triangle in R^3, okay.
[09:34:26] <ESphynx> i'm just wondering if something is missing and whether the focal distance of the projection etc. actually matters
[09:34:40] <ESphynx> field of view...
[09:35:07] <isekaijin> Does your definition of “A obscures B” allow for “A partially obscures B”?
[09:35:18] <ESphynx> yes

[09:35:44] <ESphynx> (and assuming that A and B do not intersect)
[09:36:33] <ESphynx> Could A possibly obscure B with a smaller Field of View, but not with a larger one?
[09:36:38] <isekaijin> Okay, then think about how a light beam would travel from a point in B to the eye.
[09:37:47] <ESphynx> yes well the light beam does seem to indicate that this should be true
[09:38:08] <isekaijin> A partially obscures B if there exist a point p in A, and a point q in B, such that that p “is in the way”, not letting a light beam travel in a straight line from q to the eye.
[09:39:04] <ESphynx> yes
[09:39:12] <isekaijin> Now, if we take the union of the line segments joining the eye and a point in B, we get the solid tetrahedron you mentioned.
[09:39:47] <isekaijin> And A partially obscures B if and only if A has a point in this solid tetrahedron.

[09:47:01] <isekaijin> If P does not intersect T, then neither does A, so we're done.
[09:47:16] <isekaijin> If P intersects T, then the intersection must be a point, a segment of a triangle.

[09:50:18] <isekaijin> If P \cap T a point, you just need to test whether this point is in A.
[09:50:33] <isekaijin> If P \cap T is a segment, then it can intersect A in two ways.
[09:51:08] <isekaijin> One way is that P \cap T is in the interior of A, i.e., both endpoints are in A.
[09:51:25] <isekaijin> The other way is that P \cap T intersects the sides of A.
[09:52:44] <isekaijin> If P \cap T is a triangle, then it can intersect A in more ways, and right now I can't be bothered finding them all. But this should be only tedious, not difficult.
[09:54:52] <isekaijin> Errr, where I said “intersects the sides of A”, I should have said “intersects at least one side of A”.

[09:56:10] <ESphynx> however for this initial test, shouldn't a few sampling points do the job and give me the results I expect?
[09:56:54] <ESphynx> more often than not, the centroid of A should intersect that tetrahedron
[09:57:17] <ESphynx> (e.g. often A is actually fully within it)
[09:57:54] <isekaijin> Probably.
[09:58:13] <isekaijin> I made no assumptions regarding which scenarios are more likely.
[09:58:34] <isekaijin> But if you can make such assumptions, then it's likely that those assumptions can help you optimize your program.
[10:00:19] <isekaijin> Actually, I would be surprised if nobody had investigated this before. Surely someone must have studied intersectons of simplices in R^n.
[10:01:06] <ESphynx> Given a plane A,B,C,D and a point, the signed distance should be A*x+B*y+C*z+D / sqrt(A^2+B^2+C^2), right ?

[10:06:28] <isekaijin> On the other hand, the given point p0 = (x0, y0, z0) satisfies N.p0 = D0 for some D0.

[15:37:57] <isekaijin> We may assume f is surjective. Let F be an open partition of Y. By continuity, G = { f^{-1}(U) : U \in F } is an open partition of X. Since X is connected, G is a singleton. Hence, F is nonempty and any two elements of F have the same preimage. But the elements of F are pairwise disjoint, soo their preimages are also pairwise disjoint. Hence F is also a singleton.

[15:43:21] <isekaijin> Connectedness is all about the (in)ability to partition the space into pairwise disjoint opens.

[21:00:50] <Z-module> cadmio: it's a little bit subtle, actually. Given any integral domain D (including the case of D being a field), there's a formal abstract construction Frac(D), the field of fractions of D. But if D is some subring of a field K already, then you can also take the intersection of all subfields of K containing D. This will always be ring-isomorphic to the abstract Frac(D) using a map that is the identity on D.
[21:01:14] <Z-module> and your problems, you seem to only be dealing with second case, where an ambient field K is already there.
[21:02:08] <Z-module> ALso, the existence of the field Frac(D) for every domain D is why domains are exactly all possible subrings of fields.

[21:07:10] <cadmio> right
[21:07:54] <Z-module> then really F(S) is the fraction field of the ring F[S] = { p(s_1,...,s_n) : all s_i in S, any n, p(x_1,...,x_n) with coefficients in F }
[21:08:47] <cadmio> why?
[21:09:15] <Z-module> in other words, F[S] is simply all finite sums and products made from things in the set  F cup S : this is a subring of K. And then F(S) is the smallest subfield of K containing F[S].

[22:35:49] <dude12312414> by being bounded by g(x) and h(x), does it mean h(x) < f(x) < g(x), or merely |h(x)| < |f(x)| < |g(x)| ?
[22:36:25] <riv> zincy_: I don't think we can say max(U)

[22:36:56] <zincy_> supremum?
[22:38:09] <orbisvicis> dude12312414, yes that's a pretty obvious counterexample. Is "wildly oscillating function bounded between two constant functions" a counterexample, or not because 1) constant functions not invertible or 2 range of inverted constant function is [-oo,+oo]
[22:39:04] <dude12312414> that was for another thing, when I thought you were talking about derivatives

[22:42:28] <dude12312414> orbisvicis: you might also be interested in a counterexample like arsinh(x) which is bounded between x and -x but its inverse is larger than both in magnitude

[22:44:33] <dude12312414> zincy: yeah you can talk about sup and inf
[22:44:37] <dude12312414> instead of max and min
[22:47:17] <dude12312414> and yeah the idea is that if a < sup(U) < b then sup(U) is neither in U nor V because any neighborhood of sup(U) must intersect both U and V, and yet U and V are open
[22:47:26] <zincy_> Does my proof work if you substitute max and min with sup and inf?
[22:47:32] *** Quits: specing (~specing@user/specing) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:47:53] <dude12312414> there is still the possibility that sup(U) = a or b
[22:48:25] <dude12312414> the first case means U is empty
[22:48:43] <orbisvicis> dude12312414: that looks like erf, which is why I'm asking this. As I was reading an explanation of numerically estimating the inverse of a sum of erfs using Newton's method, in which the midpoint is bounded by two invertible functions

[22:50:52] <zincy_> Ah ok so I missed the needed step of taking that neighborhood to ensure that my epsilon ball around the point c spanned U and V

[23:05:02] <orbisvicis> dude12312414: h(x) < f(x) < g(x). At first I thought |h(x)| < |f(x)| < |g(x)| would be piecewise h(x) < f(x) < g(x) or g(x) < f(x) < h(x), but it is piecewise for each function about a different point, leading to intervals where for example f(x) < g(x) < h(x) is possible
