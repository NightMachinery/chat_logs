[01:04:00] <wasamasa> well
[01:04:11] <wasamasa> I wrote a command to give me that number
[01:04:51] <wasamasa> (defun my-circe-count-nicks () (interactive) (when (eq major-mode 'circe-channel-mode) (message "%i entities are online on %s." (length (circe-channel-nicks)) (buffer-name))))
[01:08:45] <greyrat> wasamasa: thanks! My ZNC/circe setup still loses history though :((
[01:09:29] <greyrat> I need to abandon my emacs setup :(
[01:14:12] <bone-baboon> wasamasa: Thanks for sharing that command.

[11:22:26] <lucerne> How do I disable the notifs for `/join ...` on startup?
[11:32:46] *** aidalgol_ is now known as aidalgol
[11:34:02] <aidalgol> lucerne: I don't disable that specifically, instead I just enable `circe-reduce-lurker-spam'.
[11:34:57] <lucerne> `circe-reduce-lurker-spam` is already `t`, but I still get these messages (only for myself though)
[11:35:56] <aidalgol> hmm...
[11:36:14] <aidalgol> I only remember ever getting the initial /NAMES output.

[14:34:30] <lucerne> Do you use a separate emacs server for IRC? I find my emacs constantly garbage collecting (even though I have increased its gc limit) after using circe.
[14:38:53] <wasamasa> I use a separate emacs process
[15:29:45] <wasamasa> lucerne: how exactly did you notice it's constantly garbage collecting?
[15:30:50] <lucerne> wasamasa: I have emacs print a notif in the minibuffer whenever it gcs
[15:31:14] <wasamasa> increasing the limit only postpones garbage collections briefly, lol
[15:32:38] <lucerne> I use sth to try to gc when idle
[15:33:00] <lucerne> `gcmh.el`
[15:33:20] <wasamasa> I'd worry more about constantly high memory usage or memory usage increasing when it shouldn't
[15:33:28] <wasamasa> catching these is a lot harder than enabling GC messages
[15:33:36] <lucerne> It's not that high; 32 MB
[15:34:12] <wasamasa> for example helm did leak memory over time until reaching several gigabytes
[15:34:31] <wasamasa> or when I wrote an emulator and couldn't afford any garbage collection to happen in the game loop
[15:35:06] <wasamasa> because stutters during the game
[15:37:11] <jdz> wasamasa: Game loop in a game written in elisp?
[15:37:19] <wasamasa> yes
[15:37:21] <wasamasa> chip8.el
[15:49:28] <jdz> wasamasa: Just wondering: have you tried measuring performance of the emulator with the native-comp branch?
[15:49:39] <wasamasa> I can't believe how often I get this question
[15:49:53] <wasamasa> performance is pretty much unchanged, most likely because rendering is the bottleneck
[15:50:56] <wasamasa> emacs sucks at rendering things at 60fps and eliz doesn't understand why you'd want to do that in the first place and why generated svg doesn't do the trick
[15:51:52] <jdz> That's a bit sad.
[15:52:10] <jdz> But emacs still lives in the last century.
[15:54:19] <jdz> And then there's me who wants a 120Hz 4k screen :/
[15:54:41] <jdz> Buying a video card is out of the question for the foreseeable future.
[15:55:20] <lucerne> jdz It's just so sad how most developers don't see what they can do with an open system
[15:56:17] <jdz> lucerne: What do you mean?
[15:57:02] <lucerne> jdz Emacs is great because it is so extensible. Most people I know wouldn't get the value of this.
[15:57:58] <lucerne> The Spacemacs/Doom key scheme is also very good. I tried Spacevim, but vim couldn't handle the load of all the cruft. I wish VSCode has sth similar.
[15:58:08] <lucerne> had*
[15:58:40] <jdz> Right, the whole technology landscape shaped by capitalistic incentives of turning everybody into consumers (including the programmers themselves).
[15:59:22] <wasamasa> native-comp might be more interesting for emulating a more challenging system
[16:01:08] <Thaodan> Since using native comp I have less lags in long running IRC sessions (more than a few days)
[16:01:51] <jdz> Native comp surely feels nimbler, but I've switched back to vanilla to see if memory consumption is different.
[16:02:06] <jdz> Not doing any fancy benchmarking, though.
[16:02:17] <greyrat> I am waiting out the native comp for it to mature
[16:02:29] <greyrat> I am tired of all the time I spent on maintaining my env
[16:02:43] <Thaodan> My emacs is running since 2 days now with 3 networks: Freenode, Bitlbee and Libera. 600MB of RAM.
[16:02:43] <jdz> For me I've had no issues whatsoever.
[16:02:47] <Thaodan> me2
[16:03:19] <greyrat> Bitlbee? What good channels do they have?
[16:03:26] <Thaodan> sometimes there were regressions before it was merged to master but those got fixed in hours.
[16:03:29] <jdz> Is there a way to see Emacs' memory usage breakdown?
[16:03:52] <Thaodan> greyrat: Bitlbee is an IM to IRC bridge. 
[16:04:00] <greyrat> jdz there is `profiler-memory-start', haven't used it
[16:04:29] <Thaodan> I use bitlbee-discord, bitlbee-facebook, telegram-purple, purple-hangouts and jabber.
[16:05:02] <greyrat> Thaodan: Oh, I see. I generally try to bridge stuff over to Telegram, as it has good native clients for everything, and its APIs are completely open, and it is very feature-rich.
[16:05:06] <jdz> greyrat: I was rather looking for actual current memory contents, not memory behavior of a piece of code.
[16:05:12] <jdz> Like ROOM function in CL.
[16:05:44] <Thaodan> greyrat: true however bitlbee has better integration into IRC and I found using that inside emacs more pleasant
[16:06:20] <greyrat> I wish there was a bridge for Whatsapp
[16:07:01] <greyrat> The congress is just nuts. Facebook doesn't even have an iPad app for their shitty messenger, and they still doubt if there is a monopoly problem.
[16:07:28] <greyrat> Their services completely suck, but the network effects are enough to keep the sheep users.
[16:07:31] <jdz> Apparently `garbage-collect` returns some numbers.
