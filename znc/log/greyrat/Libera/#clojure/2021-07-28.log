[14:38:46] <makara> hi. As I understand it, Clojure can be considered a replacement syntax for, well, pretty much any other language
[14:41:23] <andreyorst> if you mean S-expressions, then probably yes, albeight with some caveates
[14:42:34] <andreyorst> there are a lot of surface syntax transpilers for various languages that just transform S-expression based syntax to target langauge syntax
[14:42:51] <makara> ok. Any thoughts on creating a clojure shell?
[14:43:01] <andreyorst> what do you mean by shell?
[14:43:24] <makara> bash shell scripting
[14:43:49] <andreyorst> shell scripting and shell itself is kida two different things
[14:44:03] <makara> yeah, ok just the scripting then
[14:44:03] <lunik1> there are a few scripting-oriented dialects of clojure
[14:44:09] <andreyorst> for shell scripting there's a interpreted version of Clojure like babashka
[14:45:01] <andreyorst> but it's not a shell replacement
[14:45:01] <makara> "Life's too short to remember how to write Bash code. I feel liberated."
[14:45:05] <makara> so true
[14:45:30] <makara> ive been doing shell for years and still cannot remember the basics
[14:46:17] <andreyorst> POSIX shell is kinda small, and doesn't lack anything IMO, bash is simply overused
[14:47:19] <lunik1> what's so difficult to remember about IFS=$'\n' read -d "" -ra arr <<< "${1//$2/$'\n'}"
[14:47:29] <lunik1> =p
[14:47:34] <andreyorst> um, no
[14:47:37] <andreyorst> IFS='
[14:47:40] <andreyorst> '
[14:47:57] <andreyorst> this is the most portable way AFAIK =ะช
[14:48:16] <lunik1> bash/POSIX is nice when I mostly want to call external programs with not much actual logic, but I have used babashka for some more complicated scripting tasks and I like it
[14:49:21] <andreyorst> yeah, I mean, do you really need something like multidimensional arrays in shellscript? Because if you do, you'd probably want to use some other scripting language that doesn't have all the quirks that bash/zsh or even fish have
[14:50:06] <makara> andreyorst: actually that came up recently
[14:50:42] <andreyorst> given that something like Perl or Awk usually exists everywhere where bash does
[14:51:22] <andreyorst> makara: once I had the need for them, but I just wrote the basic implementation of arrays in POSIX sh and forgot about it :D
[14:51:58] <andreyorst> but that case was special, because there were no other languages but posix sh on the target system, so we had to work with what we had
[14:57:40] <makara> does anyone actually use https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven/tree/master/polyglot-clojure do you think?
[14:58:55] <andreyorst> interesting, haven't seen this
[14:59:09] <andreyorst> I'm happy with how leiningen works tho
[15:02:19] <lunik1> leiningen/deps.clj enough for me too. maybe maven is better if you need to integrate clojure with a larger java project?
[15:02:56] <makara> im looking for an excuse to use clojure
[15:03:26] <makara> my work is mainly shell, maven, and some javascript

[15:05:07] <makara> no, i got that! God i want it so bad :)
[15:06:59] <andreyorst> for me, I was a bare-metal C programmer before Clojure, it was just the fact that I really like Lisp languages, and want to work using all lisp powers. Clojure has additional interesting things like functional style with it's immutable collections, and concurrency semantics, which I think are very good for writing robust programs

[20:46:55] <technomancy> yeah but this person seemed to specifically want to avoid bash because it's a bad programming language, so I figured they didn't have a big investment in it already =)
[20:48:22] <andreyorst> btw, technomancy do you run things with some kind of TUI in eshell? Like less or top? I guess it's probably easier to open file in a fundamental mode, but it's not the same as using a pager
[20:49:20] <technomancy> andreyorst: half the point of less is to let you scroll thru output but like ... you get that for free just by running in emacs. it solves a problem you don't have. instead of top I run M-x proced.
[20:49:57] <technomancy> there a handful of things I keep in urxvt which rely on ncurses but the main one is just the mosh connection to my IRC client (which is still emacs, but remote emacs instead of local emacs)
[20:50:30] <andreyorst> well, I often open logs that are larger than 5GiB in less because it can display those without loading everything to memory
[20:50:45] <andreyorst> there's VLF package for Emacs tho, which does similar thing
[20:50:45] <technomancy> ah, well. I just don't do that =)

[23:20:38] <jcowan> There is a general hierarchy of multimethods, but you can create private hierarchies if you want to.  
[23:21:10] <jcowan> https://clojure.org/reference/multimethods says: "All of the examples above use the global hierarchy used by the multimethod system, but entire independent hierarchies can also be created with make-hierarchy, and all of the above functions can take an optional hierarchy as a first argument."
[23:21:18] <jcowan> But it doesn't say why you would want to do so.
[23:21:34] <jcowan> and I can't find any other references that explain why.
