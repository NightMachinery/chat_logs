[05:52:53] <pragmaticenigma> howdy! does anyone know a way to enable verbose logging within apache? I have an application that will load, but when I attempt to login, it never establishes a session and I get redirected back to its login screen
[05:55:20] <__adrian> that doesn't sound like a problem with apache
[05:55:36] <__adrian> i'm assuming this is a php application?
[05:55:39] <pragmaticenigma> yes
[05:55:45] <__adrian> !+error logging
[05:55:45] <php-bot> In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[05:55:50] <Sammitch> what would you guys call an operation to turn an array like [a: [b: [c,d]]] into [[a,b,c], [a,b,d]]? I can't brain out what that word would be
[05:56:04] <__adrian> though if it's redirecting to a login screen, there might not be an error
[05:56:15] <Sammitch> something something cookies
[05:56:21] <__adrian> it might just be deciding you're not logged in
[05:56:24] <pragmaticenigma> __adrian: the exact same code base is running on another server without any issues
[05:56:29] <__adrian> ...and?
[05:56:33] <Sammitch> ^
[05:56:45] <pragmaticenigma> __adrian: it runs without any issues over there, logins and everything are functional
[05:56:48] <__adrian> ...and?
[05:56:54] <Sammitch> ^
[05:56:58] <__adrian> (this isn't relevant ;)
[05:57:01] <__adrian> have you tried from an incognito window?
[05:58:01] <pragmaticenigma> yes, I've tried incognito, enabling devloper tools to see the network requests
[05:58:29] <pragmaticenigma> differences between the two machines that I can be specific is one is Ubuntu 18.04, the other Ubuntu 20.04
[06:01:30] <pragmaticenigma> I'm just looking for a flag or something to start putting up any warnings or errors that might guide me to what is missing or what I'm overlooking
[06:06:57] <__adrian> is your error reporting set up according to the advice above?
[06:07:50] *** Quits: antsomers (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[06:09:01] <Sammitch> __adrian: any word suggestions for me? :P
[06:09:20] <__adrian> "distribute"?
[06:09:31] <pragmaticenigma> __adrian: it is, but there is no file being generated
[06:09:34] <__adrian> though it's kinda weird that you're using keys and then suddenly use the values
[06:09:52] <__adrian> pragmaticenigma: touch the file and make sure it's writable by php
[06:10:17] <Sammitch> __adrian: I'm just answering a question on SO, I don't know why they'd do that either :P
[06:10:34] <Sammitch> "full join"?
[06:11:02] <__adrian> dunno. implies that there's more to the intent, and that that intent would likely affect naming
[06:11:03] <pragmaticenigma> __adrian: it is there and writable to all
[06:11:12] <__adrian> poke at context
[06:11:27] <Sammitch> I might just leave the function name as "bloat_array"... :P
[06:11:37] <__adrian> pragmaticenigma: i wouldn't recommend "... to all," but ok. like i said above, it's likely there's no error.
[06:11:56] <__adrian> is this your code? a library? a third-party application?
[06:12:05] <pragmaticenigma> TT-RSS
[06:13:16] <__adrian> have you asked on https://community.tt-rss.org/c/tiny-tiny-rss/support/5
[06:13:22] <__adrian> (assuming that's it)
[06:13:55] <__adrian> only other thing you might do is dig into the code. look at how the auth functions work, add debug logging at interesting decision points.

[13:23:15] <freeman_h> Hi guys, having some annoying issue from curl. I am getting "transfer closed with 58043 bytes remaining to read" The request method is "HEAD" using curl CURLOPT_VERBOSE and CURLOPT_STDERR I can see a log of the response however why am I getting "transfer closed with 58043 bytes remaining to read" please bear in mind this has been working for a year just yesterday it started acting up with this error
[13:44:51] <Naktibalda> the server should not be sending response body to HEAD requests
[13:45:39] <Naktibalda> so curl reads headers and drop body, that's expected for HEAD
[14:05:02] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, so what is happening is that the server is sending a response body?
[14:09:08] <Naktibalda> in command line that's the difference betwen -X HEAD  and --head  (using --head is correct), probably you haven't set HEAD correctly in your code

[17:58:15] <__adrian> https://php.net/types.type-juggling
[17:58:20] <Naktibalda> guess result of 0 == 'listed'
[17:59:11] <__adrian> it's the process of converting one or both type to the same type so they can be compared ignoring type
[17:59:27] <__adrian> "Naktibalda> guess result of 0 == 'listed'"  ← this is an important example
[18:00:21] <relipse> well PHP-FPM is loads times faster on our server

[18:01:00] <__adrian> this is the value of "listed" once you turn it into a number

[19:02:14] <__adrian> but consider: if your code only works correctly when you give it "correct" data, then your code _doesn't work_
[19:04:17] <Roelof> this is my total current code : https://gist.github.com/RoelofWobben/73e2b82a5cad0eae625382e4b18a3fff
[19:04:18] <da_wunder> and that really looks like csv, and if that is use case I would recommend to use str_getcsv - https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-getcsv.php
[19:05:24] <Roelof> and the code seems to say that a team played 2 games which is correct
[19:05:38] <__adrian> regarding "win"/"loss"/"passed"/etc. - recommend using clearer values there. e.g., seems "score:win|loss" ought to be "win:true|false"
[19:06:26] <__adrian> using strings as values can be difficult to track/validate
[19:07:01] <__adrian> in tally() you do nothing with $results

[21:17:32] <olle> ?
[21:17:33] <The_Blode> Oh and this whole PHP class thing is amazing.
[21:17:47] <The_Blode> I'm building an "item" class and "task" class for my task logger.

[21:21:41] <The_Blode> Touche, AllenJB
[21:22:05] <The_Blode> I was writing a lot of code from scratch and repeating it.
[21:22:12] <The_Blode> Made sense to use classes.
[21:22:28] <The_Blode> PHP on paper...I wouldn't be adverse to that.
