[00:00:09] <Cl0udNinja> and I'm only using like... 8GPIO pins I think? probably less
[00:01:26] <shakygator> estranger, i had bought those $50 levitons but i recently used a bunch of $12 kasa. they all work "fine"
[00:01:38] <estranger> yeah im thinking i can go cheaper for switches 
[00:01:43] <estranger> "on... off"
[00:02:03] <shakygator> the kasa is a momentary switch, which is my only gripe but whatevs
[00:02:07] <shakygator> im not spending $400 extra
[00:02:34] <shakygator> only reason i got the leviton originally was cuz it was only like 20 something, i guess on sale but now theyre not

[00:14:01] <Cl0udNinja> man, for today bein friday, it sure is dragging..
[00:14:04] <shakygator> turning on/off lights by voice or using routines to do things like turn on my exterior lights keeps me from having to wire up photocells, etc
[00:15:35] <Cl0udNinja> lol... 'I wanted to make things easy so I used more complex things than things that would've made it even easier and less input required'
[00:17:15] <shakygator> not really
[00:17:18] <shakygator> these things are super easy
[00:17:30] <shakygator> it would take more money/effort to find a spot and wire up a photocell to turn on the ext lights
[00:18:30] <Cl0udNinja> ...inline timer?
[00:18:58] <shakygator> why would i do that
[00:19:02] <shakygator> when i can use a $12 switch
[00:19:14] <Cl0udNinja> because a timer is $7 less? lol
[00:19:22] <shakygator> switch timers were $15+, and bulky, and manually programmable
[00:20:38] <Cl0udNinja> meh, to each their own. like I said, I dont want a smart home, I want a dumb home. I dont want my fridge telling me it wont open because I didnt pay my milk subscription for milk I dont have :P
[00:20:43] <shakygator> with an alexa routine i can program it to turn on/off at dusk/dawn and it will adjust itself throughout the year
[00:20:45] <shakygator> manual id have to adjust
[00:20:58] <shakygator> aint no subscriptions here
[00:20:59] <Cl0udNinja> yeah fuck all that alexa shit, no fuckin thanks

[00:37:23] <thegodsquirrel> I used to be an Android evangelist flashing and rooting, but the state of the Android ecosystem was a true nigthmare.
[00:37:50] <PublicWifi> I always flash mine with LineageOS or something similar
[00:38:00] <PublicWifi> I don't really use stock vendor android
[00:38:46] <PublicWifi> iphone is -okay-, but some of the things about it just make me rages

[00:44:37] <thegodsquirrel> That one of them fighty boy blow em up games?
[00:44:38] <PublicWifi> its getting meh reviews from people cause they are mad certain games don't work
[00:44:44] <PublicWifi> they don't understand the state of proton i guess
[00:45:14] <ptaav> i just want it because it's a new gadget
[00:45:17] <CptLuxx> pubg is now free lol
[00:45:29] <thegodsquirrel> I thought it was dumb they made a piece of hardware that won't play all games on Steam tbh
[00:45:30] <ptaav> i don't think i've played a game from steam in at least a year
[00:45:36] <ptaav> thanks game pass
[00:45:46] <PublicWifi> it would have to be a windows machine to play all games
[00:45:51] <PublicWifi> which would be dumb
[00:46:02] <ptaav> every other comparable device in that form factor is like $1000
[00:46:09] <PublicWifi> yeah
[00:46:19] <thegodsquirrel> Equally dumb to hope that developers would port the games if they made the Steam Deck.
[00:46:30] <ptaav> and i'll install winders on it for gamepass
[00:46:45] <ptaav> so i can play frostpunk and other comparable machines
[00:47:15] <PublicWifi> proton is pretty dope tbh
[00:47:24] <PublicWifi> and the amount of compatible games is getting up there
[00:47:26] <ptaav> yeah
[00:47:39] <PublicWifi> the major issues are games with easy anticheat and other kernel level anticheats
[00:47:41] <ptaav> i just hate most pc games released these days
[00:47:49] <ptaav> they're all indie/pixel/meh
[00:47:58] <PublicWifi> it would make a dope emulation machine too
[00:48:03] <ptaav> yeah
[00:48:08] <ptaav> i plan on using it for that too
[00:48:16] <ptaav> possibly emulate ps2 on the go

[00:54:03] <JollyRgrs> folding or getting blown up?
[00:54:47] <JollyRgrs> honestly, I hope their people have the will to fight, but going up against putin without the backing of any other nation... not gonna go well for them, just more deaths the longer they fight :(
[00:55:05] <vinrock> id rather they dont fight for that same reason
[00:55:08] <vinrock> they'll just get slaughtered
[00:55:12] <ptaav> i guess both
[00:55:17] <DrZak> coz you bitches havent lived under russians
[00:55:35] <ptaav> there's enough russians to stomp them whether they put up a good fight or not
[00:55:43] <vinrock> the cold war ended around 30 years ago my dude
[00:55:47] <vinrock> it aint the soviet union
[00:55:54] <vinrock> and it aint the comunist party
[00:56:06] <ptaav> prior to 2014 they might as well have lived in little russia
[00:56:14] <ptaav> but that was almost a decade ago
[00:56:16] <DrZak> no, its a kleptocracy with inhuman monsters at the wheel

[00:57:18] <vinrock> AW SHIT SON
[00:57:21] <ptaav> in order to change the subject, i'm wondering if it makes sense to buy elden rine for the xbox one
[00:57:23] <vinrock> HALF HOUR TO BLAZEIT420
[00:57:29] <sintax> ^^
[00:57:34] <sintax> i'm debating on buying it or not
[00:57:37] <ptaav> i don't have a one x or ps5. not really looking to spend $1k on it
[00:57:45] <sintax> you can do it
[00:57:49] <ptaav> apparently it runs for shit on pc
[00:57:49] <vinrock> i aint buying a console until i can walk into a store and pick one off the shelf for retail price
[00:57:55] <ptaav> i can but i won't.
[00:58:00] <sintax> vinrock: you can some times
[00:58:01] <vinrock> i aint paying these jacked up prices fuck that shit

[00:58:05] <ptaav> vinrock: this
[00:58:06] <vinrock> i have yet to see one
[00:58:08] <sintax> just depends. friend did it a month or so ago
[00:58:17] <vinrock> i would buy a PS5 and a Series X today if i could
[00:58:18] <ptaav> there's a used game store selling "bundles" for $1000
[00:58:28] <vinrock> yeah fuck that shit they can kiss my balls
[00:58:36] <ptaav> which would make sense possibly
[00:58:43] <ptaav> get demons soul and elden ring
[00:58:58] <vinrock> i want to build a racing sim rig
[00:59:01] <ptaav> but there's still a bullshit markup on the console
[00:59:05] <sintax> trailer for elden ring looks pretty graphics wise
[00:59:06] <vinrock> yep
[00:59:13] <ptaav> i've wanted to do that for flight simgs

[00:59:27] <layer8> ptaav meant: "i've wanted to do that for flight simps"

[01:01:35] <vinrock> iirc they just fixed a major performance issue with it

[01:02:01] <vinrock> i didnt know you could get cool shit in fs
[01:02:08] <ptaav> i don't think it can do combat 
[01:02:14] <vinrock> if they add the boom supersonic plane that would be neat
[01:02:41] <ptaav> there's an awesome dcs world video where a su22 pilot goes up against some rich f22 owners
[01:02:58] <vinrock> eh those are the ones i dont like, where people use mods
[01:03:03] <ptaav> "got return..lost it, got a ping...lost it"
[01:03:12] <vinrock> a huge ataction for me to the game is how accurate the modeling is

[01:03:23] <vinrock> i watch grim reapers combat sim videos
[01:03:31] <vinrock> where they do staged scenarios

[04:02:37] <Hunterkll> nah
[04:02:44] <Hunterkll> all you gotta do is shut down a majority of the bandwidth
[04:02:45] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah RIPE dose russia
[04:02:47] <shibboleth> entirely? quite the feat. effectively? diable
[04:02:48] <Hunterkll> so EU side interlinks 
[04:02:51] <shibboleth> doable
[04:02:53] <Hunterkll> okay, but russia being in RIPE doesn't matter
[04:03:05] <Hunterkll> what matters is countries ordering their telcos to shut down/disconnect links
[04:03:11] <sd> 11<H​otmess> it more the fact that getting germany to move their ass
[04:03:15] <Hunterkll> russia would have china to relay through, but they'd both see a huge bandwidth crunch

[04:03:29] <shibboleth> france, .nl
[04:03:34] <shibboleth> japan
[04:03:34] <Hunterkll> this is about physical / interface disconnect shutdowns 
[04:03:40] <Hunterkll> which is bloody easy for every country that wants to to do
[04:03:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> germay is a boarder router for russia

[04:03:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> a really important one fyi
[04:04:10] <Hunterkll> all you have to do is induce russia into a 90% utilization point or higher and their outside access becomes essentially unusable
[04:04:20] <fritzwastaken> uh oh. Someone corrected Hunterkll, time to get the popcorn
[04:04:38] <sd> 11<H​otmess> like i said getting certain nations to do it would be a nightmare
[04:04:48] <Hunterkll> doesn't have to be 100% shutdown/disconnect

[04:04:51] <Hunterkll> just enough to make it a nightmare
[04:04:53] <Hunterkll> which is easy
[04:05:13] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i doubt
[04:05:25] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the isp's would start at source blocking
[04:05:40] <Hunterkll> and uh, germany in no way borders russia
[04:05:42] <Hunterkll> so....
[04:05:49] <sd> 11<H​otmess> look at the top
[04:05:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> what sea is that?
[04:06:32] <Hunterkll> sure, baltic, etc, but we don't even need to worry about undersea cables in this scenario 
[04:06:38] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and what type of cables run under that sea?
[04:06:43] <Hunterkll> physical land border interconnects would be more than enough
[04:07:06] <Hunterkll> germany has one undersea cable in that direction, it does not terminate in st petersburg or anywhere around that
[04:07:07] <Hunterkll> fwiw
[04:07:46] <Hunterkll> it terminates in finland :)
[04:08:19] <shibboleth> finland, norway, austria, germany, romania, turkey, japan
[04:08:37] <shibboleth> hilarity ensues
[04:08:52] <shibboleth> and ofc the baltics with st. petersburg and kaliningrad
[04:09:01] <Hunterkll> russia has two inocming undersea major routes, one from finland, one from kalingrad, that little russian sttake under lithuiania
[04:09:06] <Hunterkll> in the baltic sea, anyway
[04:09:48] <Hunterkll> actually, looking at these maps, very few undersea runs for russia except their internal country loop around, so mostly land based interconnects
[04:09:53] <Hunterkll> and satellite of course, but yea...
[04:09:56] <shibboleth> oh, and poland ofc, unless you wanna impact belarus and poland
[04:10:07] <shibboleth> and .cz, .sk, sz
[04:10:21] <Hunterkll> so yea, again, we come back to physical border states shutting down connections to cripple that
[04:10:39] <Hunterkll> estonia, lativa, lithuiania and poland to choke the belarus entry point
[04:10:43] <sd> 11<H​otmess> bsc-1 c-lion 1
[04:10:48] <shibboleth> in any case, it is exceeeeeedingly unlikely there isn't a decent strategy in place for exactly that
[04:11:10] <Hunterkll> BSC Nortph Phase 2 and Kalingrad are the main ones
[04:11:20] <Hunterkll> *BCS
[04:11:26] <Hunterkll> BCS North is the finnish connection
[04:11:31] <shibboleth> completely cut off? quite hard, close to impossible. effectively? quite doable
[04:11:43] <Hunterkll> BCS phase 1 doesn't terminate in russia at all
[04:11:48] <sd> 11<H​otmess> nations would just blackhole them internaly
[04:11:57] <sd> 11<H​otmess> not cut them off at the boarder
[04:12:18] <sd> 11<H​otmess> like the uk plans too
[04:12:21] <Hunterkll> tons of wasy around it, the idea is to make their china bandwidth usage completely saturated

[04:13:18] <Hunterkll> their internal network we don't really care much about, it's about destroying their external access, which nothing they've done inside will help
[04:13:18] <sd> 11<H​otmess> sadly
[04:13:41] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so your gonna cyber attack china to block russia?
[04:13:46] <sd> 11<H​otmess> gl with that
[04:14:10] <Hunterkll> no
[04:14:21] <Hunterkll> you're just going to force most traffic going outbound through their chinese routes
[04:14:25] <Hunterkll> instead of all the open paths they have now
[04:14:27] <Hunterkll> causing link saturation
[04:14:39] <Hunterkll> that's all you need to do
[04:14:41] <sd> 11<H​otmess> like i said i dont belive that could be organised
[04:14:44] <shibboleth> hotmess: their wireless uplinks and .cn uplinks won't have time for .civ or commercial traffic
[04:14:45] <Hunterkll> it doesn't need to be a total takedown
[04:14:54] <Hunterkll> just an effective one
[04:14:59] <Hunterkll> and you don't need many countries to do that
[04:15:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> with the way the currnet ips's are in europe
[04:15:19] <Hunterkll> germany's essentially out of the equation on this one
[04:15:25] <sd> 11<H​otmess> they would activly move to mitigate it
[04:15:28] <Hunterkll> they're irrelevant in this kind of situation
[04:15:39] <shibboleth> hotmess: in any case, there's only one . <--- that alone will be a bad day
[04:16:11] <Hunterkll> you take down poland's links to belarus and lithuiania and the russian enclave, and finland's cable link to st petersburg
[04:16:12] <sd> 11<H​otmess> till the isp's souce block your attacks
[04:16:16] <Hunterkll> you're already shunting a huge amount of traffic
[04:16:28] <Hunterkll> that alone would probably be enough to cause saturation and massive routing issues
[04:16:30] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly at best you could take them out of a day
[04:16:33] <sd> 11<H​otmess> probably much less
[04:16:40] <Hunterkll> no, far longer
[04:16:41] <shibboleth> yeah... no
[04:16:50] <Hunterkll> until they shunt traffic down and block all outside access anyway to drop traffic

[04:21:45] <Hunterkll> if the TOS doesn't prohibit it... (some providers do explicitly prohibit it, some don't - like Azure in the EU doesn't prohibit it, but it's cost prohibitive - doesn't make sense to do so - unless you have free time there)

[05:03:05] <Kiernian> I love how it says "This outfit contains very delicate sewn areas" umm, that's mealy-mouthed speak for CHEAPLY MADE. If chicks who hand sewed bras in the 60's can make an airtight space suit with needles and thread, a dollmaker can do better, too.

[05:04:28] <Kiernian> "Please be careful as the color of the wig may stain the surface of the doll." right, but doesn't do proper dyefasting" is also a pretty good sign of "cheap"

[05:08:18] <Hunterkll> I paid like $500 to get a prop when it was released from their high end line that only cost about $200... it's kept its value on ebay lol
[05:08:31] <Kiernian> interesting. I mean, I guess the operative question is "saner than what, exactly" because depending on where you set the bar, that might not mean much, heh
[05:08:45] <Kiernian> oh, okay. that's actually impressive for holding value
[05:08:46] <Hunterkll> well, there's one situation I just described

[05:10:16] <shibboleth> Kiernian, limited supply. look up p.t barnums white salmon
[05:10:38] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, i'm assuming the value depends on mint/boxed condition?
[05:10:40] <Hunterkll> I fully expect the Y'shtola to be worth about $3-4k *immediately* once they ship them 
[05:10:41] <shibboleth> "value"
[05:10:52] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: for the most part, but even used, you're still looking at $300 up with minor wear and tear

[17:49:32] <BWMerlin> I think I shall you the sleep, will take a backup of the list for the Flow and fire it off tomorrow

[17:51:33] <xe0n> as if you're working on the weekend...
[17:52:03] <BWMerlin> I need this working, it is what lets me know people have paid for things
[17:52:15] <xe0n> sounds like a monday job
[17:52:26] <BWMerlin> The whole process (Microsoft Flow aside) has to many manual steps that fail
[17:53:07] <BWMerlin> It has been broken for so long I need it running because students are going without devices because I haven't had time to check it manually
[17:54:00] <BWMerlin> And I literally spent all of Friday failing to get it to work (I was even uploading the Flow that was sent to me by the helpdesk guy who left and failed to carry out a direct instruction)
[17:54:19] <xe0n> has your new mate started?
[17:54:56] <BWMerlin> Yes
[17:55:06] <xe0n> cool
[17:55:11] <BWMerlin> I have tried my best to give them a good start but I am worried
[17:55:17] <BWMerlin> Shall see how we go with week three
[17:55:25] <xe0n> haha
[17:55:29] <BWMerlin> They really do need to pickup the pace
[17:55:30] <xe0n> my replacement started three weeks ago
[17:55:46] <BWMerlin> Oh you got a new job?
[17:55:50] <xe0n> new role
[17:56:34] <BWMerlin> What is your role now?
[17:56:55] <xe0n> solutions architect\project engineer
[17:57:28] <BWMerlin> Get more money for that?
[17:57:31] <xe0n> yeah
[17:57:33] <BWMerlin> An office of your own?
[17:57:41] <BWMerlin> Work from home?
[17:57:49] <xe0n> errr sure, i work from home\in the office 1-2 days a week if that
[17:57:49] <xe0n> lol
[17:58:19] <xe0n> valley is a shithole
[17:58:19] <xe0n> lol
[17:59:04] <BWMerlin> Never really done much in the valley, do remember having a really great night at the family or was it the beat
[17:59:17] <BWMerlin> What ever the gay club was
[17:59:35] <BWMerlin> Down stairs had awesome hardstyle
[17:59:50] <BWMerlin> Up stairs had roller skating drag queens
[17:59:55] <xe0n> loll
[17:59:57] <xe0n> sounds like the valley
[18:00:14] <xe0n> rather stay on the coast lol
[18:00:19] <BWMerlin> The hardstyle was my thing
[18:00:21] <xe0n> but yeah 1-2 days in the office, depends whats required
[18:01:11] <BWMerlin> I would like work from home but my job it isn't possible
[18:01:46] <xe0n> company has accepted hybrid is the way, they did a survey and like 80% or something said they wanna work 1-2 in office, rest from home
[18:01:48] <BWMerlin> Did I tell you last job asked if I would come back?
[18:01:50] <xe0n> so meh works for me
[18:01:55] <xe0n> saves me 2hr odd travel
[18:02:07] <xe0n> yeah, and i said dont bother
[18:02:10] <xe0n> what a step backwards
[18:02:36] <BWMerlin> Yes and no
[18:02:52] <xe0n> rubbish, nothing has changed at old place, you'll complain about the same shit three months in
[18:02:55] <BWMerlin> Overall I think the organisation would grind me down again
[18:03:00] <xe0n> yes...
[18:05:09] <BWMerlin> There are pros and cons
[18:05:38] <xe0n> here's an idea, get out of the school system...
[18:05:39] <xe0n> that shit is rubbish
[18:05:51] <BWMerlin> I want out bad but I am trapped
[18:05:56] <xe0n> no you're not
[18:07:00] <BWMerlin> Last job was good in that I had free reign over a heap of tech, current job is almost helpdesk in the level of access I have
[18:07:13] <BWMerlin> Pretty much can do password resets only
[18:07:50] <BWMerlin> There is opportunity for some things like I wrote this pretty awesome powershell script to add and remove devices from AD and Workspace ONE
[18:11:44] <xe0n> cool
[18:12:15] <BWMerlin> Yeah it is, once I polish and of course test it more I will let the other schools have at it
[18:12:40] <BWMerlin> I think I need to turn it into a powershell module or web app if I add any more features to it
[18:27:51] <xe0n> the emoji picker is busted in the current insider build
