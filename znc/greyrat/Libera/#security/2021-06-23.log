[06:47:12] <MadCamel> the switch to a commercial product with zero options for end to end encryption is a bit jarring.

[06:48:21] <MadCamel> me too.
[06:48:59] <Joanna> Why did they change ? Because of freenode debacle?
[06:49:49] <MadCamel> Unlikely. I figure it's due to features, lower barrier to entry, money. Selling virtual tickets now.

[18:15:48] <TimMc> ttys000: Most of the malware that arrives in someone's mail ends up in spam and is never seen, or the recipient is suspicious and doesn't open it -- so endpoint security has much lower exposure to possible AV sandbox escapes and buffer overflows and whatnot in malware, since it sees less of it (assuming webmail).
[18:16:16] <TimMc> It's a bit of a fine point, but ideally you don't want to scan anything that the recipient isn't intending to download and open.

[19:21:28] <wyre> hi guys, what makes a CA official? I mean ... as I've understood ... I could self-sign my certificates being my own CA
[19:21:34] *** Joins: betelgeuse (~john2gb@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[19:21:52] <wyre> so ... I guess the browser itself is who recognizes the CA and marks the cert as trusted or unstrusted, right?
[19:23:52] <[iz]> basically there are root certs that browsers all trust from the start
[19:24:11] <[iz]> and other certs are chained off those
[19:24:36] <piou> it's worth noting that it's not just browsers

[21:05:20] <ajak> but your ISP isn't going to know if you have another subnet running behind your router
[21:05:30] <c0n4m> where i live 'they' now are legally allowed to infect ANY device with a government-trojan
[21:05:45] <c0n4m> they are even allowed to secretly enter appartments/houses to install them

[21:07:48] <TimMc> Same for running ethernet -- not everyone is in a situation where they can do that.
[21:07:55] <plasticuproject> You'll pay more leasing the hardware from the isp in the long run

[21:08:40] <c0n4m> if the government is now legally allowing gov-agencies to install trojans on devices of people not even suspected of a crime, what do you f-ing do at that point?
[21:09:02] <c0n4m> you can't even have a diary on your computer anymore without runnig the risk of embarassment
[21:09:06] <soulisson> plasticuproject, here the hardware is not leased. I think it's included in the fees. If it breaks, you get a new one with no additional charges.
[21:09:07] <ajak> soulisson: sure, but ancient switches/routers don't tend to be that expensive
[21:09:08] <plasticuproject> TimMc: Yeah my wife won't let me string eth all over the house unfortunately lol
[21:09:26] <c0n4m> only confident people can send dickpicks under these circumstances...
[21:10:15] <ilikeyou> some isp either force you to use their hardware, charge more for not using it, or won't give you static ip's without it. weird stuff
[21:10:30] <c0n4m> ilikeyou: how do they know?
[21:10:47] <ajak> MAC address presumably
[21:11:03] <plasticuproject> yup it's the MAC
[21:11:10] <ilikeyou> no idea. i came across the docs when shopping around. i'm sure i'll bump into it sooner or later
[21:11:17] <soulisson> ajak, yeah for me, it wouldn't be an issue but I know that for some families, it would because the ISP fees are already expensive and they don't want to pay extra money.
[21:11:26] <c0n4m> does your gov install trojans on inocent people's machines?
[21:11:45] <ajak> i recently tried getting away from my ISP's hardware and they 1) would charge me more if i returned their modemrouter and 2) wouldn't DHCP to my modem
[21:11:49] <c0n4m> why even use a computer at that point
[21:12:21] <plasticuproject> There's ways around all that, but you have to turn to the dark side.
[21:15:06] <tesseract> in here ISPs don't even give you username and password of the modem
[21:15:13] <plasticuproject> Anyway most ISPs I've had let you BYOM as long as it's compat so they can push their configs on it and stuff.

[22:26:57] <plasticuproject> bubbajbubba: are you talking about the router, I'm talking about the actually modem
[22:27:43] <plasticuproject> The modem does indeed have interesting stuff on it, if you are so inclined.
[22:29:00] <plasticuproject> I brought my own modem, with custom firmware so I can poke around.
[22:29:05] <bubbajbubba> Oh sorry, I was implying the earlier complaints of being forced to use the ISP's gear. I use my own modem as it pays for itself in less than a year vs rental charges.
[22:29:38] <plasticuproject> Exactly, they get you coming and going with their hardware rental/lease garbage.
[22:29:44] <bubbajbubba> yep
[22:30:13] <bubbajbubba> but I prefer my firewall vs anything onboard (bunch of zones in my house for different systems.)
[22:31:46] <plasticuproject> Oh yeah, it's def nice to segregate stuff and whatnot. I was running some irc and xmpp servers from home for a while and kept that server pretty seperate from everything else.
[22:32:09] <bubbajbubba> cousin luigi: I would not send anything over WPA2 that is important data unless it itself was on an encrypted session if that answers your question.
[22:32:24] *** Joins: uoj6wz6qoswb (~hNyLZird~@user/spareproject)
[22:32:54] <bubbajbubba> Yeah, I put the IoT stuff on a separate zone and AP, home stuff, lab stuff and my work pc on its own.
[22:33:12] <bubbajbubba> so 4 zones. it works.
[22:33:20] <plasticuproject> Yeah wifi it's too easy to MITM your session
[22:33:36] <cousin_luigi> :'(
[22:33:56] <bubbajbubba> No chance for WPA3 on your gear (AP and client(s))?

[22:34:55] <MadCamel> wpa2 psk/aes isn't considered broken yet is it?
[22:35:01] <plasticuproject> Doesn't most hardware that supports WPA3 backwards compat with 2, defeating the purpose of the new security?
[22:35:24] <bubbajbubba> Yeah, unless you specifically restrict WPA2 backwards compatibility
