[03:34:18] <brocellous> I think I've used _multi_parts before but is there a way I could call a function to complete the values?
[03:34:50] <brocellous> so I can take advantage of the default complette functions sometimes, e.g. file:_files

[15:43:25] <dg1727> If I do  my_in="\UC4 \UC5 \UC6 \UC7 \UC8"; print -v my_out -- "${my_in}"; echo "${my_out}"; print -- "${my_in}";  and use a hexdump utility to compare the 2 outputs, they differ.  It seems "print -v" has an issue.
[15:44:02] <Mikachu> print and echo both parse escapes (in different ways) by default
[15:44:08] <Mikachu> use -r with print and -E with echo to disable it
[15:44:29] <dg1727> I want the escapes; do you have further suggestions?
[15:44:43] <Mikachu> you want the escapes to what?
[15:44:54] <dg1727> Print a character by hex Unicode codepoint
[15:45:17] <dg1727> Also, why should "print -v" be different than "print" without the "-v"?
[15:48:06] <dg1727> If I change 'echo' to 'print --' the same issue is still there
[15:48:20] <dg1727> The problem isn't with the statement that I first wrote as 'echo'
[15:52:47] <Mikachu> well, i can't think of any other explanation it would be different
[15:53:19] <dg1727> I'm not sure I follow

[18:33:28] <dg1727> Regarding Unicode problem of a few hours ago:  I've upgraded to zsh 5.8.1 (compiled locally from tarball) & run script with 'zsh -f' (to disable startup files) but still have the problem.  Maybe an OS library is the issue?
[18:43:28] <Mikachu> might not be fixed until 5.9
[18:43:50] <dg1727> Do you think the issue is in the shell?
[18:44:07] <Mikachu> b6ba74cd4eaec2b6cb515748cf1b74a19133d4a4
[18:45:02] <dg1727> But I could Git the source & compile locally?
[18:45:32] <Mikachu> you could
[18:46:34] <Mikachu> dg1727: can you try using print -v var -f %s "\whatever"
[18:47:22] <dg1727> With my current 5.8.1 ?
[18:47:35] <Mikachu> or 5.7.1
[18:47:44] <dg1727> Working on it
[18:47:46] <Mikachu> according to my old investigation that should work around the problem

[18:53:15] <dg1727> Using 'printf %s' does indeed seem to work around the problem.  :-)  As I'm using 'print' elsewhere in the script & meeting the same problem there, I'm interested in simply upgrading my shell.
[18:55:42] <Mikachu> i don't understand what you mean
[18:55:51] <Mikachu> you can change any instance of print -v foo to print -v foo -f %s
[18:56:04] <Mikachu> i think
[18:56:09] <Mikachu> (not printf)
[18:56:22] <dg1727> Would rather not modify the syntax of 'print' to 'printf' & that is an excuse to have an updated version of the shell.  :)
[18:56:36] <dg1727> 'print -f' is a synonym for 'printf'
[18:57:32] <dg1727> If I'm going to use 'print -f' I'd rather use 'printf' which is more concise.
[18:58:14] <dg1727> And 'print' with the bugfix (%s not required) is even more concise.
[18:59:15] <Mikachu> i guess if you're afraid of having % characters in the printed string that's a concern
[19:00:12] <dg1727> I am already using 'print --' to keep the string from being taken as option switches.
[19:02:08] <Mikachu> ah, sorry i lied a bit earlier
[19:02:17] <Mikachu> i said print -f %s foo, but that won't expand escapes in foo
[19:02:25] <Mikachu> you need print -f %b -- foo
[19:02:44] <Mikachu> rather, print -f %b -v out -- foo
[19:02:57] <Mikachu> then you also don't have to worry about % in foo
[19:03:53] <dg1727> Many thanks.  I am also working on compiling from Git, since that seems to be a bit more robust solution.

[21:45:00] <mehwork> even some online base64 encoders do, so i agree that it can make decoding it confusing for other people because how do they know if you use newlines or not?

[21:46:18] <Mikachu> you can do this also
[21:46:49] <Mikachu> i guess we can mention it in the docs
[21:46:55] <Mikachu> (that it does add a newline)
[21:47:05] <danielsh_> don't we already?
[21:47:27] <Mikachu>        <<< word
[21:47:27] <Mikachu>               Perform shell expansion on word and pass the result to standard input.
[21:47:30] <Mikachu>               This is known as a here-string.  Compare the use of word in here-docu‐
[21:47:33] <Mikachu>               ments above, where word does not undergo shell expansion.

[21:48:02] <Mikachu> there's no ambiguity for << since the EOF word has to appear on a new line in the first place
[21:48:07] <Mikachu> so the previous line has to end with a newline already

[21:51:24] <Mikachu> yeah, i saw that in my grep results for <<< and tested it :)
[21:51:37] <Mikachu> although it's unclear which behaviour should be considered a bug
[21:51:52] <Mikachu> bash does add the newline too
[21:51:59] <danielsh_> add where?

[21:52:30] <Mikachu> and dash doesn't appear to support <<<

[21:52:54] <Mikachu> yeah
[21:53:07] <danielsh_> as to adding a newline to =(<<<foo) ...  
[21:53:09] <Mikachu> so add docs to say newline is added, and fix optimization
[21:53:11] *** Joins: gl0woo (~gl0woozzz@phobos.whatbox.ca)
[21:53:22] <Mikachu> i don't think =(<<<foo) and =(cat<<<foo) should produce different output
[21:53:42] <danielsh_> just wondering if anyone might be relying on that
[21:54:03] <Mikachu> what better way to find out than by making a release with the change and waiting 3 years
[21:54:06] <danielsh_> I don't think I do... I wouldn't use that if I needed a \n-less file
[21:54:25] <danielsh_> so yeah, what you proposed
[21:54:32] <danielsh_> + NEWS/README 
[21:55:03] <Mikachu> there's a char *s in here, allocated via dupstring()...
[21:55:19] <Mikachu> which means it uses zhalloc
[21:55:20] <danielsh_> The =(<<<foo) construct, which creates a temporary file with contents "foo", now adds a newline byte after "foo" for consistency with the behaviour of the <<< redirection everywhere else.
[21:55:31] <danielsh_> the docsstring does actually say it's heap allocated
[21:55:43] <danielsh_> but you still need to dup it again to add that byte
[21:55:51] <Mikachu> which i guess means i can use dyncat and ignore the original string
[21:56:05] <Mikachu> the naming of these functions makes absolutely no sense
[21:56:10] <danielsh_> +1
[21:57:10] <Mikachu> i wonder if dyncat is a bit overkill with the s2 always being a constant one byte, but i also don't want to open code it

[21:57:34] <danielsh_> then use strend() :P 
[21:58:05] <danielsh_> I was gonna say, simple_redir_name() is static so can make it allocate one more byte, if you want to go down this route
[21:58:20] <danielsh_> (but yeah, strend is problematic with empty strings, better to just dup the entire thing)
[21:58:30] <danielsh_> ("closed code")

[22:14:42] <Mikachu> A04 has double spacing on the tests, that's insignificant right?
