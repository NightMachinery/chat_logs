[03:45:24] <MootPoot> not that I'm aware of 
[03:45:35] <MootPoot> I can just select devices and put them on their own vlan
[03:45:38] <MootPoot> and keep them isolated
[03:46:52] <ButterNoodle> ok.. then I'd put the game server on a host only vswitch and isolate it with a router vm of some sort "pfsense" :cringe:, vyos, or something similar

[11:21:45] <ZdrytchX> actually depends how erect i am lol
[11:21:55] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: maybe EVA, since everyone probably watched it
[11:22:06] <ZdrytchX> i can probably suck myself off if it extends that far enough but at that point my dick's hurting too much
[11:22:14] <ButterNoodle> tru.. I just watched the movies again recently
[11:22:21] <ZdrytchX> ive yet to watch eva 4
[11:22:29] <ZdrytchX> eva 3 was a bit weird with the branching plotline
[11:22:32] <ButterNoodle> its been a number of years since I've seen the series tho
[11:22:44] <ZdrytchX> actaully eva 3 probably makes no sense without watching eva 4 but i've already forgotten ost of eva 3
[11:22:46] <milkshake1> 6 inch? thats big
[11:22:49] <ZdrytchX> it's been too long between release dates
[11:23:25] <ZdrytchX> milkshake1 not compared to the probably average dildo
[11:23:42] <ButterNoodle> well just use what u need

[11:23:59] <MootPoot> javascript
[11:24:14] <ZdrytchX> MootPoot i considered doing scripting
[11:24:20] <ZdrytchX> butj the grind to become efificent in just one language is too much
[11:24:27] <milkshake1> the only thing that frustrate me is the girth ZdrytchX 
[11:24:29] <ZdrytchX> and i suck at languages enoguh as it is lol
[11:25:16] <MootPoot> I need to become one of those leetcode lunatics
[11:25:22] <ZdrytchX> milkshake1 what are you, i think im like 3.2cm or something. The average asian is pretty small i hear
[11:25:36] <MootPoot> nah
[11:25:40] <ZdrytchX> as long as you break 3cm im sure ur're sufficient for porn
[11:25:40] <MootPoot> I looked that up
[11:25:50] <MootPoot> average asian pp is about the same as everyone elses
[11:25:54] <MootPoot> roundabouts 5"
[11:26:20] <MootPoot> I know this becuase I've sucked a lot of asian dicks to try and get a job
[11:26:27] <milkshake1> ZdrytchX: what 3.2cm girth? thats pencil
[11:26:55] <milkshake1> MootPoot: japanese police girls will arrest you for being gay
[11:27:00] <ZdrytchX> wait isnt girth diameter
[11:27:03] <ZdrytchX> pencil is about 1cm
[11:27:07] <amigojapan> ZdrytchX: scripting can be as hard as any other kind of programming, also, once you learn one language learning others is not that hard
[11:27:18] <MootPoot> cockscript
[11:27:22] <ZdrytchX> yeah but amigojapan im terrible at languages. I'm great at algorithms
[11:27:30] <ZdrytchX> so in a dual-programming team i can work
[11:27:50] <milkshake1> ZdrytchX: 3.2cm is too tiny , i think average is 8cm diameter
[11:28:14] <ZdrytchX> oh im measuring the minimum internal bit not including flabby skin on outside
[11:28:31] <amigojapan> ZdrytchX: if you want to help me with my projects, we can do it in dual-programmer mode
[11:28:54] <ZdrytchX> including flabby skin im like 4cm
[11:29:19] <amigojapan> ZdrytchX: where I share my screen
[11:29:33] <ZdrytchX> im not gay no thax ;D
[11:29:54] <ZdrytchX> oooh girth measured is the perimeter
[11:29:58] <ZdrytchX> not the diameter
[11:31:47] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: in about an hour and a half I need to start working for a while
[11:32:04] <ZdrytchX> 3.2*pi = 10cm
[11:32:10] <ZdrytchX> wait does that mean im massive
[11:32:20] <ZdrytchX> pretty sure im smaller than average

[17:39:24] <Sadale> wikifurry-84, If it's just up to $10k, I do have the fund to invest into it partially. But there's a few problems. a) I've no idea on how I could ensure that you wouldn't just take the fund and run away b) No idea on if it's that profitable c) may have to pay for maintenance cost and shit
[17:39:30] <wikifurry-84> It more common in the uk Sadale, but as far as I know, nothing in Ontario
[17:39:41] <Sadale> and d) I'm not even inside Canada.
[17:40:27] <Sadale> Anyway shipping is $10,000. So what's the cost of the boat itself?
[17:40:43] <Sadale> I misread and thought that $10k was the boat cost
[17:41:16] <wikifurry-84> Sadale, I will not actually handle any of the money,  its all you, im the visionary, the idea,  and I'm giving it to you like one of my children (metaphorically)
[17:41:28] <Sadale> oh lol thanks for the idea
[17:41:39] <Sadale> I don't think I could execute that idea at all tho. A boat would be like super expensive xD
[17:41:54] <Sadale> And I'm literally on the other side of the planet.
[17:42:00] <wikifurry-84> 10 to 60k
[17:42:08] <Sadale> oh. That's not too bad.
[17:42:09] <wikifurry-84> For the boat
[17:42:24] <wikifurry-84> 20k to outfit it
[17:42:28] <Sadale> If I sell all the stonks that I own I could buy that. But that'd be very risky.
[17:42:52] <wikifurry-84> But you'll get an easy income
[17:43:12] <Sadale> and vandalist is a thing. also you'll need to do customer support with the buyers or potential renters.
[17:43:26] <Sadale> That'd require a bit of work. Or you could hire someone else to do that for you
[17:43:30] <wikifurry-84> That's all handled by airbnb
[17:43:37] <Sadale> oh really?
[17:43:43] <Sadale> nice. I didn't know that's how airbnb work
[17:43:46] <wikifurry-84> Google it

[17:44:13] <Sadale> As a non-user of airbib I'd just take your words
[17:44:41] <wikifurry-84> Yeah, shipping it could be *expensive*

[18:12:07] <Sadale> ah.
[18:12:12] <DunceCotus> ghostly, white, people
[18:15:44] <bxgelsan> Wong is common name where Sadale is
[18:15:53] <bxgelsan> hell i knew a wong growing up
[18:15:54] <bxgelsan> lol
[18:17:39] <Sadale> lol
[18:17:46] <DunceCotus> seems there's still a lot of concepts to make about reality, and language has a lot of holes.. where is my Wite?
[18:17:51] <Sadale> And yes it's common. In fact, there're two Wong surnames sharing the same romanization
[18:18:13] <Sadale> Both 黃 and 王 are romanized as Wong. I'm not sure on which Wong ewong is. But what I'm sure is that both of us are Wong :P
[18:18:51] <DunceCotus> what does Wong mean?
[18:19:11] <DunceCotus> what is it to be Wong
[18:20:04] <DunceCotus> are these just arbitary labels we attach fantasmatic significance to or is it more some pre-conscious ancestral connection through a name
[18:20:42] <Sadale> Literally speaking, 黃 means yellow. And 王 means king/emperor. Anyway when used as surnames, they're just surnames. We don't care about what they actually mean when used as surname.
[18:21:24] <DunceCotus> shouldn't we?
[18:21:38] <Sadale> It's like the Smith in John Smith. Just becasse it has a Smith on the surname doesn't mean that he's a smith.
[18:21:53] <DunceCotus> maybe they should be smithing away 
[18:22:04] <DunceCotus> get back in ya box
[18:22:41] <DunceCotus> Sadale: why do we hold onto these names then? 
[18:22:53] <DunceCotus> we don't care what they mean as surname but we must pass them along
[18:23:12] <Sadale> If you're talking about the Chinese surnames, I dunno. It's just a convention to pass the surname from father to son.
[18:24:06] <DunceCotus> perhaps its about the meaning woven through tradition or something
[18:24:18] <DunceCotus> can't have every generation choosing their own names, would be bonkers
[18:24:47] <DunceCotus> Sadale: it could also be a kind of collective habit
[18:25:00] <Sadale> probably just a collective habit.
[18:25:10] <DunceCotus> where it becomes pressurizing to not pass the baton as it were
[18:25:43] <Sadale> Actually for 黃 I've heard that this surname was granted to someone by an emperor for having significant contribution to the society or something.
[18:26:07] <Sadale> I've no idea on where the 王 surname came from.
[18:26:34] <DunceCotus> we're not really in feudalism anymore
[18:26:42] <DunceCotus> but we mostly have feudal surnames
[18:26:47] <Sadale> haha
[18:27:09] <DunceCotus> capitalism is a different beast to despotic regimes
[18:27:23] <DunceCotus> even if it has a lot of similarities, and draws from despotic socius

[18:27:37] <Sadale> technically here in Hong Kong (China), we could pick whichever surname we want. But people just use their dad's surname, or very rarely, the mom's surname
[18:27:37] <DunceCotus> as we can see in surnames, historico-technological development
[18:28:05] <Sadale> stupid evil filthy capitalism :P
[18:28:08] <DunceCotus> right
[18:28:25] <DunceCotus> well its a certain oedipalization via capitalism 
[18:28:33] <DunceCotus> we owe our parents
[18:29:18] <DunceCotus> "mommy daddy me" oedipal triangulation of the subject
[18:30:22] <Sadale> meh.
[18:30:23] <DunceCotus> Sadale: to break with it would seem a betrayal to our parents
[18:30:32] <DunceCotus> and I can get that
[18:30:48] <Sadale> In Chinese traditional thought people do believe that we owe our parents. Even today most people I know do buy into this idea. I don't buy into this idea tho.
[18:31:08] <Sadale> The parents had a choice to get us spawned. We don't. And this world's stupid/ :-(
[18:31:55] <Sadale> Plus my dad's stupid as fuck. To put it simply he has zero people skill, just like Andrew Lee except that he doesn't have the money.
[18:32:04] <DunceCotus> well there's still a sense of the ideal upbringing etc.
[18:32:16] <DunceCotus> maybe not in Japan though, I dunno
[18:33:26] <DunceCotus> Sadale: yeah I understand some people hate their families
[18:33:36] <DunceCotus> or are at least indifferent to them
[18:33:58] <DunceCotus> Sadale: but at the same time we're still adherent to the concept
[18:34:02] <DunceCotus> the collective habit
[18:34:24] <DunceCotus> or we have the ideal form that we try to reach through the habit

[22:10:06] <Fenderbassist> treeman6: I suppose, I was late in doing so myself
[22:10:45] <Fenderbassist> treeman6: oh that's a good question, I haven't been using a gym but rather working out at home, so I don't have a bench to test at the moment, more like I do 30 pushups at bodyweight
[22:11:12] <Fenderbassist> I'll guess 200?
[22:11:29] <Fenderbassist> my max as an old dude
[22:11:47] <Fenderbassist> 200 lbs
[22:11:47] <treeman6> 200 lbs?
[22:11:52] <Fenderbassist> yeah
[22:12:00] <Fenderbassist> not sure what that is in kilos
[22:12:01] <treeman6> ok pretty decent

[22:12:46] <Fenderbassist> Urchin[emacs]: ty
[22:14:28] <Fenderbassist> treeman6: here is a preview of coming attractions....the way you feel and think, you'll probably feel and think similarly 30 years later....just, the body will have aged and you will have seen a great deal more of life
[22:14:55] <Fenderbassist> so you can be 56 and still like certain forms of anime or music or movies or whatever
[22:15:22] <Fenderbassist> this isn't Logan's Run, there is life after 30
[22:15:41] <treeman6> i honestly dont see a point Fenderbassist 
[22:15:48] <treeman6> of living after 30 or 35
[22:15:59] <Fenderbassist> perhaps when you're 30 or 35 you will
[22:16:03] <treeman6> ur old no one likes you and ur body is failing
[22:16:19] <Fenderbassist> I suspect you will have made friends by then
[22:16:31] <treeman6> wait 56 year olds have friends?
[22:16:37] <treeman6> what do you guys do together?
[22:16:39] <emmeka> harsh.
[22:16:43] <treeman6> nnonononono
[22:16:46] <treeman6> im not being an ass
[22:16:50] <treeman6> curious
[22:16:58] <Fenderbassist> D&D games
[22:17:04] <Fenderbassist> road trips for concerts
[22:17:08] <treeman6> my uncle is in his 50s and he just seems defeated
[22:17:12] <treeman6> his wife hates him
[22:17:12] <Fenderbassist> parties
[22:17:16] <Fenderbassist> ah
[22:17:24] <treeman6> my father too lol
[22:17:31] <bxgelsan> may be a reason
[22:17:32] <treeman6> fat 50+ year old wife 
[22:17:37] <bxgelsan> if more than one feel a way
[22:17:41] <treeman6> whats the point
[22:18:04] <treeman6> what do parties look like for you Fenderbassist 
[22:18:08] <Fenderbassist> treeman6: I understand and regret to hear of his troubles, doesn't mean it's like that for everyone
[22:18:12] <bxgelsan> who goes to parties
[22:18:14] <bxgelsan> o.O
[22:18:19] <bxgelsan> small gathering maybe
[22:18:27] <bxgelsan> keep your circle small.
[22:18:29] <Fenderbassist> treeman6: same as they did in the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s
[22:18:37] <treeman6> alcohol and weed?
[22:18:44] <emmeka> never forget: the guy from the Berkeley student movement who is famously quoted as saying to "never trust anyone over 30" is currently over 80 years old.
[22:18:44] <Fenderbassist> some yes, some no
[22:18:48] <treeman6> or like barbecue 
[22:18:49] <Fenderbassist> depends on whom you are talking about
[22:18:53] <emmeka> time is unforgiving, it'll happen to you too!
[22:19:27] <Fenderbassist> treeman6: you ever watch the Critical Role stream?  Most of my friends are like them
[22:19:35] <Fenderbassist> those kinds of personalities
[22:19:35] <treeman6> no
[22:19:38] <Fenderbassist> ok
[22:19:58] <treeman6> i cant imagine 50+ year old people actually having fun tbh
[22:20:31] <Urchin[emacs]> I've heard a lot about Critical Role, but never really watched it
[22:20:32] <Fenderbassist> you would be amazed
[22:20:36] <treeman6> like my uncle having fun instead of bitching about politics or his wife or his son
[22:20:37] <Fenderbassist> how much fun old bikers have
[22:20:39] <emmeka> idk man, old people get it pretty good. discounts everywhere, all the real estate...
[22:21:06] <Fenderbassist> old hippies, old bikers, old musicians, old painters, old sculpters
[22:21:08] <emmeka> you'd be having fun too if you paid like $5000 for a house currently worth $1.2 million
[22:21:21] <treeman6> money never mattered to me
[22:21:41] <treeman6> i was making money from my software as an 18 year old and i didnt give a fuck about it
[22:21:50] <emmeka> well, statements like "life ends at 30" and "money doesn't matter to me" just betray your age
[22:22:02] <Urchin[emacs]> ^
[22:22:03] <treeman6> a burger still costs $3 doesnt matter if you are broke or a millionaire
[22:22:35] <Urchin[emacs]> treeman6: depend's how broke you are
[22:22:51] <treeman6> how old are you Urchin[emacs] 
[22:23:09] <treeman6> i will die before i get old fuck that shit
[22:23:14] <Urchin[emacs]> treeman6: mid 30s
[22:23:25] <bxgelsan> treeman6, you are saying shit i said when i was in my early 20s
[22:23:27] <treeman6> and how is life like
[22:23:28] <bxgelsan> "ill die before 30"
[22:23:29] <Urchin[emacs]> treeman6: live fast and die young type?
