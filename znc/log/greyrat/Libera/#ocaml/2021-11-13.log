[14:36:51] <d_bot> <octachron> @gar : you cannot compile an implementation file as an interface `ocamlc -intf foo.ml` will emit a syntax error as soon as `foo.ml` contains non-type-level items. Similarly, `ocamlc -i foo.ml` emits a mli file aimed at human reader, and it can fail to produce a valid mli file. The canonical path is to compile the file with  `ocamlc -c foo.ml` which produces a correct `foo.cmi` file for all valid `foo.ml`.
[15:06:32] <zozozo> @fakusb : there's try-ocaml that does that (one of the solutions being that the toplevel is actually executed on the client, so no trouble for the server)

Not sure if this is the right forum, but here goes: I generate a file, `codept.args`, listing all the modules in the project, and I pass it to codept using `-args`. I do this because I need global deps analysis.  The problem is that some of the files do not appear in the output.  The cause seems to be that the codebase includes duplicate sourcefile names; for example, `main.ml` occurs in multip

[17:57:35] <d_bot> <octachron> I would suggest to open an issue and I will look at it.
[17:57:35] <d_bot> <octachron> If the stars are aligned using the `-nested`  argument which puts all modules `foo/dir/m.ml` into the `Foo . Dir` namespace might solve the issue without creating problems.
[17:57:37] <d_bot> <octachron> Otherwise, if the duplicate modules are only leaf modules, you could put them in their own namespace with `Namespace[main.ml]`.
[17:59:52] <d_bot> <octachron> For instance,  `codept test/main.ml Exe[main.ml]` places the second `main` module in the `Exe` namespace solving the issue.
[17:59:53] <d_bot> <octachron> Otherwise, you will need to communicate more about the namespace structure to `codept` in order to explain how the project is differentiating between the duplicate modules.
[18:02:31] <d_bot> <gar> Ok thanks, I'll fiddle around with your suggestions and open an issue with either a problems or some documentation.
