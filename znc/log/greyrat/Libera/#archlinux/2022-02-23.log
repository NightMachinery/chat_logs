[06:27:23] <ectospasm> That was a silly thing to do.  
[06:27:42] <ectospasm> Can you get root access?
[06:27:57] <piousminion> I'm arch-chrooted in. :P
[06:28:30] <ectospasm> OK, so at the very least `chmod -R go+rx /usr/bin`
[06:28:34] <ectospasm> That will get you started.
[06:28:58] <ectospasm> A lot of things still won't work, because their libraries won't be readable.
[06:29:17] <piousminion> I know. :/  I was hoping there was some pacman wizardry that could solve this
[06:29:42] <Scimmia> reinstall all packages. If you only changed files, that should do it, iirc
[06:29:51] <Scimmia> dirs would be more of an issue
[06:30:17] <ectospasm> If you have a separate home partition it may be easier just to reinstall the system.  You'd need to somehow get a list of all the packages you had installed, I'm not sure that will be easy since using pacman in the archchroot might be broken horribly.

[07:42:07] <Betal> if we want to replicate/backup the system (given home/boot are separate partitions), can we only copy /etc, install all packages and then overwrite with copy of /etc ?

[09:52:20] <grawity> with UEFI, I guess you'll be using a partition for zfs (not whole disk)?

[09:53:08] <grawity> so create the EFI partition, then half the disk for a "future" ZFS partition and the other half for ext4
[09:53:16] <grawity> install arch on ext4
[09:53:26] <iqubic> I'd like to have about a 512M boot sector, 32G swap (I think that makes sense), and the rest will be ZFS.
[09:53:33] <grawity> once you have arch, install zfs stuff, and `mv` or rsync everything to the zpool
[09:53:52] <iqubic> 16G RAM = 32G Swap.
[09:53:54] <grawity> once it boots from zfs, nuke ext4 and grow the zfs partition
[09:53:59] <grawity> and no, 32 GB swap does not make any sense
[09:54:21] <grawity> the "2x RAM" rule stops making sense above ... dunno, 2 GB RAM?
[09:54:27] <iqubic> Oh? Really?

[10:20:46] <demonicmaniac1> you can also always use a swapfile, don't have to use a full partition for it

[10:24:02] <demonicmaniac1> oh i didn't scroll that far back i only had the which filesystems supported in buffer
[10:24:17] <grawity> but IIRC there were some deadlock problems with that
[10:24:48] <grawity> iqubic: for the EFI system partition, 100 MB is generally the minimum and can get too small at times, but 512 MB is the maximum you'll ever need

[10:26:16] <iqubic> Or rather boot sector of 512M.
[10:27:04] <invra> i think its beacuse popOS uses the EFI partition for the kernel aswell. but the reason could be another
[10:27:06] * quequotion sees the arguments raised in that article and raises that he has no SSDs, and with 16 GB of RAM for typical desktop usage only reaches OOM if something is terribly wrong.
[10:27:20] <demonicmaniac1> i guess the biggest advantage of swap partition vs file is easier sharing across multiple distros installed or being used by live environments as well vs swapfile
[10:27:31] <grawity> "boot sector of 512M" is nonsensical
[10:27:35] <iqubic> Oh?
[10:27:38] <iqubic> It is?
[10:27:43] <quequotion> on the other hand, the hibernation system requires a swap partition or file and it is useful for that.

[10:28:59] <demonicmaniac1> and never ever actually touch disk swap but getting like 25% more "ram" for caches/buffers/dentries usable
[10:29:08] <iqubic> invra: How does that work?
[10:29:10] <grawity> invra: it makes various things easier tbh, e.g. you can let the "real" ZFS in your initramfs deal with boot-from-ZFS, instead of screwing around with compat features to make GRUB support your pool

[10:30:20] <invra> i mean for zfs i dont know

[10:30:51] <invra> he said that he was not going to use zfs tho
[10:30:55] <iqubic> I've decided that I'm not gonna use ZFS. It's not officially supported.
[10:30:59] <grawity> sometimes in the form of another zfs pool that has lots of features disabled, for grub support
[10:31:07] <iqubic> invra: It's she/her for me, actually.
[10:31:37] <grawity> or dump the kernel + initramfs into the EFI system partition
[10:31:41] <grawity> that's why distros do it
[10:31:46] <invra> yeah
[10:32:00] *** Joins: indux (~Thunderbi@5.28.90.74)
[10:32:01] <grawity> whereas for ext4 or btrfs, grub does a better job at supporting all the new feature flags, so it can read the kernel directly from your btrfs root
[10:32:10] <invra> so iqubic to make it easy since its your first install it seems... follow th einstall guide and do what it tells you
[10:32:16] <grawity> though still not a 100% guarantee it'll keep up
[10:32:27] <iqubic> So, I've gonna use ext4, or btrfs, or something like that. Will I still need a boot partition?
[10:32:33] <invra> no

[10:32:48] <grawity> technically no, but still a good idea to have one, but just reuse the EFI partition as /boot
[10:32:52] <invra> i am using btrfs because you can do snapshots easily to backup 
[10:33:06] <invra> jsut do 512MB EFI  rest for root
[10:33:18] <invra> easy and simple
[10:33:22] <grawity> yeah, don't create a separate partition for /boot, but do make the EFI partition around 512M

[10:33:32] <iqubic> invra: Yeah. That's the main I'm gonna want out of a filesystem. Easy snapshots.
[10:33:34] <grawity> and mount *that* as /boot later if needed
[10:33:47] <invra> then btrfs is your thing
[10:33:50] <iqubic> So btrfs it is.
[10:34:00] <invra> its rock solid i been running it for years
[10:34:02] <grawity> also snapshots aren't long-term backups, they only become backups if you `btrfs send` them somewhere else
[10:34:34] <iqubic> Now, does the installation guide explain how to set this up?
[10:34:38] <grawity> source: spilled coffee on my laptop 15 years ago
[10:34:39] <demonicmaniac1> subvols and compression for me are the reason i go btrfs everywhere

[15:12:12] <f00> so badly written programs will not use my home as default

[15:18:56] <Khorne> Defaulting to the default is a 1=1 problem in the first place, regardless of the case at hand, and yea, either look for application-specific settings that allow to move the config files or..well, live with it
[15:19:34] <Khorne> Personally, I don't have much of an issue with stuff in ~, but.. *shrug*

[16:42:55] <grawity> who decided to call it 'destroy domain' instead of 'stop VM'?...
[16:43:28] <CaTaCaS> I've only seen one qemu video so far, will read up on libvirt etc. I will of course not use the pure terminal version, I want to have UI :)

[18:07:57] <arjab> @Scimmia Ah yes, it's the one from January. I'll try the latest one, thanks for the hint.
[18:08:10] <majuscule> I can play sound via aplay -D plughw:1,8 ./piano2.wav, and see the corresponding hdmi output in pulse pavucontrol, but no sound is produced. I see hdmi output in pactl list sinks What might I be doing wrong?
[18:08:13] <mpan> Scimmia: regarding old ISO keyring issues and my mistake on the forum recently (assuming outdated system, not noticing no keyring update). Why would -Syu not trigger keyring update?
[18:08:50] <mpan> arjab: if the problem persists, update archlinux-keyring first (alone), then try installing anything else.
[18:08:58] <Scimmia> arjab: all you would have to do is update the keyring. Either on the ISO or chroot into the new system first

[18:10:37] <Scimmia> mpan: the problem comes from the installation order; pacman depends on archlinux-keyring, which means archlinux-keyring gets installed first. The post_install script tries to call pacman-key --populate archlinux, but there is no pacman-key installed yet, so it can't

[18:16:52] <mpan> arjab: be aware that this is not a typical situation either. The keyring just received a lot of changes recently. That’s not happening often.

[18:20:06] <mpan> arjab: also, it’s IRC, not Twitter. There is no need to prepend @ to names and it is actually counterproductive, at it often prevents people from being highlighted when you address them.

[19:34:35] <Scimmia> ilomiglio: do you have a swap partition/file?
[19:34:38] <tirnanog> zswap will do nothing without at least one active swap.
[19:35:02] <ilomiglio> i have a swapfile but i disabled it in /etc/fstab thinking systemd-swap would create a new one
[19:35:15] <ilomiglio> i see, so i have to enable my swapfile?
[19:35:21] <Scimmia> yes
[19:35:22] <rapha> after changing from an encrypted swap part to an unecrypted one, i still have errors during boot, even after running mkinitcpio and grub-mkconfig ... where else but /etc/fstab and /etc/default/grub and /etc/openswap.conf do i have to change the UUID?

[23:45:41] <r3d1n> yeah I install wireless with iwctl
[23:45:43] <Scimmia> without knowing anything about your adapter, nobody can say for sure, but it's likely

[23:46:43] <iqubic> I can query info about my adapter. Currently I have a bare-bones Ubuntu Live Environment running on my laptop.

[23:50:17] <dino1> depends on how new your hardware is, if it's old you'll searching for firmwares to install. Might take awhile to get wifi working on old machines

[23:50:59] <KenwoodFox88> This is an aur question but, im trying to follow the maintainer's workaround suggestion for ffmpeg dependencies, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ignition-common-3#comment-853437 here
[23:51:02] <phrik> Title: AUR (en) - ignition-common-3 (at aur.archlinux.org)
[23:51:13] <KenwoodFox88> i dont want to uninstall my system ffmpeg, can i just temporarily remove it from my path while i build the package?

[23:51:48] <Scimmia> KenwoodFox88: build in a clean chroot
[23:51:56] <jelle> KenwoodFox88: ffmpeg4.4 does not conflict with ffmpeg
[23:52:06] <KenwoodFox88> Scimmia: Ill give that a go~
[23:52:22] <KenwoodFox88> jelle: it errors out saying: libx264.so=164-64 (target)
[23:52:39] <iqubic> dino1: My laptop was purchased in 2017 or so. This ubunutu live environment was able to pick up my network card without issue.
[23:53:01] <Scimmia> KenwoodFox88: that's not an error

[23:55:10] <KenwoodFox88> Scimmia: Ah, that makes sense, then ill find a way to figure this out :)
[23:55:31] <Scimmia> for that error, figuring it out just involves updating your system

[23:56:44] <Scimmia> that's completely separate from what the maintainer was talking about, though
[23:57:19] <KenwoodFox88> I can see that now, ill remove my comment, im on the manjaro repos so i could build ffmpeg from scratch or streal it from arch stable or somewhere else
[23:57:39] <dino1> then you can probably install arch on it, use iwctl and ping some servers and see if its working though before starting the installation 
[23:57:49] <Scimmia> !give KenwoodFox88 notarch
[23:57:50] <phrik> KenwoodFox88: https://terms.archlinux.org/docs/code-of-conduct/#arch-linux-distribution-support-only
[23:58:46] <Scimmia> !give KenwoodFox88 manjaro
[23:58:46] <phrik> KenwoodFox88: manjaro does things differently from arch, so we can't really support it. ask in #manjaro on freenode.net, or in #manjaro or #linux on libera.chat
[23:58:48] <KenwoodFox88> Yeah, thank you anyway, ill give this a go on the machine at home witch should have the more up-to-date mirrors
[23:59:10] <KenwoodFox88> phrik yeah i tottally understand, ill just use my desktop till manjaro fixes things
[23:59:10] <phrik> KenwoodFox88: Eh?
