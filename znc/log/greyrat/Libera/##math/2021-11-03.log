[00:26:08] <somiaj> they do? In this context there really aren't numbers
[00:26:47] <somiaj> in graph theory, all that matters about the vertex set is the number of points in it, and it is convient to have symbols to identify each distinct element, but their actual names tend to not matter
[00:27:22] <rex_victor> yeah I understand that it doesn't matter because of isomorphy
[00:27:27] <somiaj> so when they say V := {a,b,c,d} all they are saying is there are 4 vertex points and we are going to call them a,b,c,d, so that kinda defines what a,b,c,d are
[00:27:35] *** Quits: extern (~archer@141.226.62.146) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[00:28:15] <somiaj> so wanting a,b,c,d to be defined to me sounds like you are thinking of them as variables, and not just as labels.

[00:30:49] <rex_victor> No I understand they are just labels and the naming is required to talk about the edges e.g. it just feels weird. It seems like they all come from nothing. But I guess the more strictly approach with taking a complete graph and defining your stuff as a subset of it, is not convenient :)
[00:32:34] <somiaj> I think if you were to approach this from a more formal theory, you would have some set of symbols to just mean distinct of free variables, and can just assume that a,b,c,d,.. are part of those set of symbls
[00:33:06] <somiaj> to me I don't see much difference than using 1,2,3,4 as symbols to identify the distinct elements, which as you said might also just be defined in the background
[00:33:16] <rex_victor> Yeah a formal axiomatic approach to graph theory might work like that
[00:33:53] <somiaj> though I really never cared that they weren't defined, because they are just being used as distinct symbols, and don't have any other special meaning beyond that.

[00:36:06] <greenbagels> implicit definition of vertices like somiaj says; the typica ldefinition of a graph G is a pair (V,E) of a vertex and edge set; you could say "let a, b, c, d be distinct vertices such that V = {a,b,c,d} is the vertex-set"
[00:36:20] <greenbagels> but i think V = {a,b,c,d} is just the faster implicit way to do it

[01:22:14] <aeplus> 100 * (1.07)^100, i think

[01:23:31] <stuffny> oh ok
[01:23:49] <sonny> crazy, wonder who invented it
[01:24:09] <stuffny> so the return would be 10700%?
[01:24:22] <Batzy> aeplus invented it
[01:24:34] <mornfall> 1.07^100 is ~867.72

[04:00:16] <Guest41> honestly I reccomend to everyone to slog through a massive volume that gives a primer on all maths; printed by Cambridge or any book that claims to review the general ideas of the material. It's helps to get a handle on notation/nomenclature jargon/parlance etc.

[04:53:31] <ysftaha> Nevermind. Thanks cuppajoeman
[04:53:47] <cuppajoeman> Can you explain why? I'm curious
[04:53:54] <tusko> u guys like to do math?
[04:54:32] <emby> cuppajoeman: oh okay... Because BC and BD are equal, but BD is a leg of a right triangle and AB is the hypotenuse, so AB is greater than BC.
[04:55:49] <ysftaha> cuppajoeman: using (1) and (2) to get three how?
[04:56:56] <ysftaha> (1): there is a constant that is in C but not B.   (2): if an element is in A then it is in B
[04:57:17] <cuppajoeman> emby: Yup, that's right
[04:57:21] <cuppajoeman> nice work

[04:57:59] <cuppajoeman> If a is in A, then we get a cont.
[04:58:02] <cuppajoeman> So a is not in A
[04:58:11] <ysftaha> cuppajoeman: excluded middle is obvious. Not the question.
[04:58:20] <cuppajoeman> Sorry I'm misinterpreting
[04:58:46] <cuppajoeman> Maybe someone else here has more exp with set theory.
[04:58:58] <ysftaha> ok. the proof continues after to get a ∉ A ∧ a ∈ C

[05:01:08] <cuppajoeman> What did I do wrong btw
[05:05:05] <ysftaha> ok. so if you do an excluded middle i.e. get x ∉ A that leaves the problem of a ∈ C (it is not the same constant as x). What the prof did was use (1) and (2) as if (1) was quantified universaly. it is not though. How is that a correct step is my question.

[05:10:47] <cuppajoeman> So all 3 are talking about the same a

[10:17:49] <devcpu> qergle: let's say that C is the set of all integers greater than 1, that cannot be factored as a product of primes. by WOP let's assume m is the smallest element in that set. since m cannot be factored then m is not a prime. since m is not a prime then m = a * b, where a, b < m. since a, b are smaller than m, that means that they are primes because they do not belong to set C. a can be written as p1*pK and
[10:17:55] <devcpu> b can be written as q1*qL, therefore m can be factored and written as m=p1*pK*q1*qL, this is a contradiction, our assumption that C is not empty is false. BOOYAKASHA!

[12:31:02] <d3x0r> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY9GAyJtuJ0 hyperbolic geometry is a good example of a fractal dimension - where you NEED a third dimension to represent it, even 'flatish'

[14:12:18] <W> i.e. if you consider g(x)=f(x-x_k) for some k, the resulting polynomial for g will have coefficients that's a linear combination of the value, derivative value, ..., derivative order m value, suggesting that you can generate separate polynomials for each of these values in some elegant way, but the text that pointed this out does not explain how

[14:40:26] <fentanyl> we take the length of the small triangle (in that integration part) and use that to integrate over a limit `a` and `b`
[14:40:41] <savask> fentanyl: It's not super formal math, but if you remove "dx" from (2) it will be better. sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) = sqrt((1+(dy/dx)^2)*dx^2) = sqrt(1+(dy/dx)^2)*dx kinda

[14:54:18] <fentanyl> Hmm, so your suggestion is to turn dx^2 to dx since dx is gonna be small anyway? Hmm...I'm kinda critical of that since it'd be nice if its "proven" though instead of "assuming"

[17:17:14] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Do not feel too bad if you cannot come up with these things on your own. While the proof is not very difficult, it took no less than a David Hilbert to realize that this is a viable proof strategy.

[17:25:19] <brownorange> "p ↔ ~Bew(G(p))"  Let me give a proof by contradiction why this doesn't work.  Suppose that p was TRUE, if p was TRUE then p implies all q where q is true, and all q implies  p, because all propositions imply true. Every theorem is regarded as true. Thus every theorem implies p. But p is then provable by every theorem, thus p contradicts itself in saying it is not provable.

[17:29:21] <isekaijin> A grading on a k-algebra gives you everything that is nice about a local ring (e.g., a system of parameters), but does not force you to work with a space that has only one closed point. Nice.

[18:18:36] <d3x0r> I don't really understand the problem... a(x,y)=20x+21y b(x,y)=21x+20y  c(x,y)=a(x,y)-b(x,y) where that's on the x-y plane is a solution ?https://www.geogebra.org/3d/tfvgne4a   what's the constratint? is it like you only have 21 you can use?
[18:19:42] <Simplar> qergle: Chris spent all money he had, buying 20 pens and 21 pencils, whose prices are natural numbers. There are no ways to reduce one price and increase the other to buy 20 pens and 21 pencils for all money Chris has, so only one set of prices is possible. The task is to find the greatest amount of money Chris had under such conditions.
[18:19:53] <somiaj> d3x0r: well if arg(z^2) = -pi/4, then z^2 = r e^(-pi/4 i), so now just take both roots of that.
[18:21:00] <Simplar> The minimal amount of money is indeed 41, with prices being 1 and 1

[18:28:47] <brownorange> I believe the most critical points of my proof/argument is that 1) propositional calculus is non-causal. 2) all formal systems that have a so called true but unprovable liar sentence require a successor formal system where the sentence is true. 3) all such formal systems utilize propositional calculus that could prove this fact anyway

[18:47:14] <biberao> hi can anyone help me solve this limit https://imgur.com/RjJUxQO ?
[18:47:22] <isekaijin> brownorange: What do you mean by a sentence being “true” in the absence of an interpretation?
[18:47:44] <isekaijin> brownorange: In any case, the propositional calculus by itself has no means to talk about sentences.
[18:48:12] <brownorange> @isekaijin it doesn't need any greater means
[18:48:20] <isekaijin> brownorange: Perhaps you are talking about a system in which you are talking about the propositional calculus? (The aforementioned system is NOT the propositional calculus itself.)
[18:48:23] <brownorange> it is quite literally the case that all propositions imply true
[18:48:35] <brownorange> in prop-calc all propositions imply true
[18:49:15] <brownorange> so it's fair to say all propositions imply all true propositions
[18:49:48] <[itchyjunk]> the meta language that talks about the formal language was also mentioned in geb
[18:50:01] <[itchyjunk]> i'm starting to like the book reading things in here lol
[18:50:15] <isekaijin> Wait, “true” itself is not a proposition in the propositional calculus. And if you wanted to turn it into one, you better call it something else, like “T”, to distinguish mit from the concept of “true” as in “a statement being true in an interpretation”.
[18:50:17] <isekaijin> brownorange: ^
[18:50:57] <d3x0r> no
[18:50:59] <brownorange> yes true itself is a truth constant, but every proposition that is true or biconditional with true, must itself be true
[18:51:21] <brownorange> so if some proposition is regarded as true, all other propositions imply it
[18:51:32] <isekaijin> s/regarded as true/a tautology/

[18:52:21] <biberao> yes

[19:26:39] <riv> sqrt(x)ln(1-1/x) = [x/sqrt(x)] ln(1-1/x) = x ln(1-1/x) / sqrt(x)
[19:26:44] <riv> it's a rewrite then a rearrangement
[19:26:53] <biberao> riv: but you see if that one works
[19:26:58] <biberao> mine should work too
[19:28:07] <biberao> like he moves the "x" back to exponent
[19:29:08] <riv> wait a second
[19:29:09] <riv> 15:56:38	<riv>	sqrt(x)ln(1-1/x) = [x/sqrt(x)] ln(1-1/x) = x ln(1-1/x) / sqrt(x)
[19:29:11] <riv> are you happy with this?
[19:29:38] <biberao> yes
[19:29:44] <riv> good
[19:29:46] <biberao> im basing on what module typed
[19:29:54] <biberao> i dont want to keep highlighting him
[19:30:09] <biberao> ln[(1 - 1/x)^x] <- he finished with this
[19:30:16] <biberao> so i was right
[19:30:30] <riv> ok so we are here:  x ln(1-1/x) / sqrt(x)
[19:30:33] <riv> what is the next step
[19:30:33] <biberao> yes
[19:30:46] <biberao> he did put the x inside the ln
[19:30:55] <biberao> that is the neper limit
[19:30:58] <riv> what is the next step?
[19:30:59] <biberao> so e^-1
[19:31:10] <biberao> ln e^-1
[19:31:28] <biberao> or something
[19:31:30] <biberao> ?
[19:31:39] <riv> x ln(1-1/x) / sqrt(x)   where do you go from here?
[19:31:54] <biberao> ln[(1 - 1/x)^x]/ sqrt(x)

[21:20:30] <quantum> norias: It's certainly possible to do a PhD without a Masters, but I'd say it's rare enough to not really be worth considering
[21:20:39] <quantum> (unless you know you could do it and several of your professors agree)
[21:21:08] <riv> it's too complex for me atm, but I may look at it later
[21:22:42] <somiaj> I think it is more common for those going for a PhD to go directly for it after undergrad, and not get a masters first. Some places will give a masters along the way, or allow it as a fallback option, but at least in the US, going for a PhD without a masters is somewhat common for those wanting a phd
[21:24:58] <greenbagels> somiaj: masters typically aren't funded too, right?
[21:25:03] <greenbagels> or are they?
[21:25:12] <somiaj> it really depends on the location, my masters was funded
[21:25:47] <tomeaton17> I wish it was the same for me in the U.K. Currently paying a crazy amount of money for imperial in london.
[21:26:35] <somiaj> I think the choice is often more what your end goal is, PhD is more if you want to do research in acidema, while a masters is often useful for many non acidemic jobs
[21:27:08] <somiaj> though people with PhDs do go work in industry, just in general PhD is more focused on math research while a masters may allow a bit more variety

[22:13:43] <greenbagels> so i would not sweat it; do what you like most going into it
[22:14:10] <morphism> riv: I know it's all preference but some things are harder than others for example, if I go and study computer science there is going to be a lot of things that I've already learned. for example usually, they start teaching some kind of beginner friendly programming language like python then a little bit of C and then networks and things like that. I've been studying CS (I mean the real theoretical
[22:14:11] <morphism> part of the cs like algorithms, data structures and ...) and some discrete mathematics along side programming languages like Haskell, C, python and lisp
[22:14:54] <greenbagels> better to start too easy than too hard :)
[22:16:27] <morphism> and I think learning advance mathematics would be a better Idea because I still can complete the CS coarses by myself but someone told me that you should consider a job too and I'm certain that finding a job in tech is at least a little bit easier than with a pure math degree
[22:16:37] <morphism> to be honest I don't know what to do anymore
[22:16:55] <riv> just depends on how strong your handshake is
