[14:02:40] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[14:02:59] <gahr> sorry I think I force-pushed over your foce-push
[14:03:15] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:03:22] <flatcap> yeah, np fixed :-)
[14:05:58] <flatcap> I'm wondering how we can code my pattern config into the unit tests
[14:06:36] <flatcap> sorry, nice job btw. much less scary now :-)
[14:07:55] <gahr> you can just add it to my leak.c :)
[14:08:01] <gahr> it doesn't test anything, it's just there to cover for leaks
[14:08:57] <flatcap> great, I'll give it a try later
[14:12:20] <gahr> I won't be here in the afternoon
[14:12:40] <gahr> but I can take more interesting tasks in the morning, if you can think of something
[14:12:49] * gahr thinks he'll regret this.
[14:13:03] <flatcap> hehe, thanks
[14:13:16] * flatcap thinks quickly
[14:15:33] <gahr> I think I'd like to see status_on_top=yes_and_no :)
[14:15:49] <gahr> ever thought about that?
[14:16:06] <flatcap> hehe, I confess I hadn't
[14:16:25] <flatcap> got a picture?
[14:17:11] <gahr> I'm not very good at photoshopping
[14:17:20] <gahr> imagine the status bar both on top and on bottom
[14:17:59] <flatcap> both?
[14:18:09] <flatcap> configured separately, I suppose?
[14:18:48] <gahr> not necessarily
[14:18:53] <gahr> I'd like to see the same thing above and below
[14:19:07] <flatcap> oh

[14:21:27] <gahr> when in the index :)
[14:21:48] <flatcap> yes, I realise that now
[14:22:57] <flatcap> do you truly want duplication, or just "status_on_top" to only apply to the index?
[14:24:03] <gahr> I'd like to have the status duplicated
[14:24:23] <gahr> I sometimes have my eyes in the upper part of the screen, sometimes in the lower
[14:24:30] <gahr> and I'd like my status to be at eye reach :)
[14:24:34] <gahr> I keep changing that config
[14:24:45] <gahr> it's probably a very niche thing to want
[14:24:53] <flatcap> you need a smaller screen :-)
[14:25:49] <flatcap> or $status_bar_follows_focus = yes -- top/bottom depending on the indicator's position
[14:29:21] <flatcap> yes, a bit niche.  you'd probably only need to alter a couple of functions:
[14:29:54] <flatcap> index_pager_init() -- insert another ibar, ipanel_config_observer() -- prevent status_on_top changes messing things up

[15:22:52] <jindraj> I'm having a problem compiling neomutt on macOS 12.1
[15:23:50] <jindraj> git bisect says first bad commit is  e42ba8288b87b4d17ec469594015c3a593d66434 and here's the make output with the errors https://pastebin.com/eZtSfyxk
[15:24:08] <jindraj> shoud I create a github issue for this?
[15:26:55] * flatcap looks ...
[15:27:58] <flatcap> hmm... the new colour code
[15:31:56] <flatcap> can you have a look at your ./configure output.  I see checks for both functions:
[15:31:57] <flatcap> Checking libs for bkgrndset...none needed
[15:31:59] <flatcap> Checking libs for setcchar...none needed
[15:34:04] <flatcap> can you check if either are defined in /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/curses.h
[15:34:11] <flatcap> (or any other *curses*.h)
[15:44:26] <jindraj> ./configure output says none needed for both.  here's the file /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/curses.h https://pastebin.com/Sv9f9KuQ there are some ocurences of mentioned libs.
[15:46:52] <jindraj> hmm weird is that in my build script I'm setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH, LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS to ncurses from brew but the system ncurses is used 
[15:48:15] <flatcap> yes, they're both defined in that header
[15:50:04] <flatcap> can you try forcing the ncurses location with `--with-ncurses=path`
[15:50:35] <flatcap> possibly to the path: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr
[15:50:57] <flatcap> is there a `lib` subdir in there, too?
[15:53:27] <jindraj> yes, there's a lib subdir there
[15:53:32] <flatcap> ok, good
[15:53:41] <flatcap> are you using `./configure --pkgconf` ?
[15:54:12] <flatcap> that'll try to use pkg-config; if not it'll try searching for itself
[15:54:30] <jindraj> no I'm not. I'll try
[16:06:32] <jindraj> well, my problem isn't only the ncruses. I've just noticed configure ends with failure while checking for iconv
[16:07:00] <jindraj> I'll try to deep dive more into it myself before bothering you more.
[16:12:20] <flatcap> ok
[16:12:51] <flatcap> I've found another configure option that _might_ help `--with-sysroot`
[16:13:05] <flatcap> that seems to be used by all the checks
[16:13:45] <flatcap> I'd try setting that to either
[16:13:48] <flatcap> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
[16:13:49] <jindraj> hmm I think i can't use --with-sysroot, since I use some libraries from homebrew e.g. lua
[16:13:50] <flatcap> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr
[16:14:02] <jindraj> ah, ok. let's try.

[16:20:13] <jindraj> no, my bad. there was a dangling space… I'm able to finish configure now. 
[16:20:54] <flatcap> ok
[16:21:28] <flatcap> at worst case, you could add the two prototypes to the top of gui/mutt_curses.h
[16:21:30] <flatcap> int setcchar(cchar_t *wcval, const wchar_t *wch, const attr_t attrs, short color_pair, const void *opts);
[16:21:32] <flatcap> void bkgrndset(const cchar_t *wch);
[16:21:52] * flatcap sighs
[16:22:09] <flatcap> no, if you do that the linking stage will fail instead
[16:23:07] <jindraj> nevermind. I don't need to be on latest commit. There's no issue bothering me. So I'm okay with few weeks old verison…
[16:23:38] <flatcap> :-(
[16:23:43] <flatcap> does upstream mutt compile (with no configure options)?
[16:28:01] <jindraj> let me try neomutt without any options (I'll add only --disable-… on failures)
[16:28:21] *** Joins: TheMaker (~nbert@user/nejc)
[16:28:32] <jindraj> ok, now we know it fails the same
[16:30:54] <flatcap> ok good :-)
[16:31:01] <jindraj> mutt compiled correctly. 
[16:31:46] <flatcap> is HAVE_SETCCHAR defined in config.h (for mutt)?
[16:34:29] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@05453449.skybroadband.com)

[16:38:50] <flatcap> so mutt didn't find the right version of curses

[16:43:39] <jindraj> mutt and my latest neomutt (f3b9af) are both compiled against ncurses: ncurses 5.7.20081102 - the system one. 
[16:43:55] *** Joins: sss1 (~sss1@46.148.180.137)
[16:45:08] <flatcap> I see: ncurses 6.2.20210508 - dated over 12 years later
[16:47:11] <jindraj> oh my god how I hate outdated macos stuff. system bash is 3.2… So my objective is to force compile neomutt against brew version
[16:48:36] <flatcap> according to wikipedia Bash 3.2 came out in 2006-10-11
[16:49:14] <flatcap> it makes Debian look bleeding-edge :-)
[16:50:04] <flatcap> are there *any* system libraries you want to use?
[16:51:33] <flatcap> if not, I'd probably cheat and `chmod 700 /usr/include` -- forcily hide them all

[17:06:23] <jindraj> oh no. Got it… I don't remember when this happened. Most probably ~1y ago when I got MBP M1 with arm after my previous laptop died. It was fresh install and I installed brew from scratch. It changed it's location from /usr/local/opt to /opt. variables with CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS with paths to ncurses contained the old paths. 
[17:07:21] <flatcap> oh!  I'm glad *you* understand :-)
[17:07:27] <jindraj> It was working ok with the old system ncurses version as fallback until the recent change. Now after changing the paths in CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS I'm back on track. Sorry for bothering you and thanks for your help

[23:17:59] <jindraj> just an idea about my today's situation. If I'm not mistaken I noticed recently a discussion here about the C99 standard and moving forward. Since neomutt dropped support for s-lang and currently it's not possible to compile it against ncurses from 2008 I would say moving forward with C standard is no longer a blocker :D
[23:29:18] <jindraj> I checked the logs. I must have been mistaken… nvm
