[00:27:44] <eyeris> In ruby3 how can I capture the current block in order to pass it down to another function? I used to be able to call other_func(&Proc.new) even if other_func was declared without parameters and called yield.

[00:39:04] <eyeris> It looks like the proper approach is to abandon block_given?, declare all methods that previously used it with a &blk final param, and then use 'if blk' before calling it.

[14:50:55] <leah2> and tbh i dont want to do it for two packages probably noone uses anyway

[20:22:44] <hansolo> It's funny to me how a language can have many successful projects written in it, proving it can solve our problems, and can still fall out of favor over time.
[20:25:20] <hansolo> Github, Gitlab, Zendesk, etc, all used Ruby to climb to the top of their industries. Now that they are at enterprise scale they are moving on to other languages due to limitations of the language. They still hire  ruby devs and will for years and years to come. But new companies looking to make their own way into the industry, don't typically consider ruby. Which to me seems odd since ruby excels in startup, quick bootstrapping, scenarios.

[20:28:57] <adam12> We suffered from our own success in some ways. Bootcamps aggressively pushing unqualified Rails developers caused people to sour on Rails (in some ways, deserving). People adopt these Rails projects from previous developers, which are commonly a ball of mud, and then claim Rails is dead, Rails cant scale, blah blah blah. But if it was Clojure that
[20:28:57] <adam12> the bootcamps were pushing, it might have seen a similar fate.
[20:29:45] <adam12> I don't think Python saw this to the same degree because it didn't have the ubiquitous Rails. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a 50/50 split of Django/Flask. So it's less common to have a concentration of "bad" projects.

[20:31:48] <clemens3> python lives from ai/ml while ruby lived from rails.. guess which continues striving..
[20:32:31] <adam12> That's a good point. The web moves fast.
[20:32:40] <clemens3> i like ruby the language.. but when it comes to hyper threading, i don't know, new languages closer to the metal
[20:33:31] <clemens3> and i don't know if backwards portability has been an issue, maybe not, but if a company has to spend time and money to update the code, they might as well look at the next hot language/technology
[20:34:08] <clemens3> of course, python shot itself in the foot and survived..
[20:34:21] <clemens3> but just because the ai field is so hot..
[20:34:28] <adam12> It's generally been pretty good, other than the keyword argument stuff that's been changing. It hasn't necessarily been an issue for me yet, but the pattern that was breaking wasn't super common.
[20:34:48] <clemens3> well, rails was breaking for me all the time
[20:34:50] <adam12> I think Python's AI support is very much just wrappers around C libraries? Not something that Ruby couldn't have, with invested interest.
[20:34:59] <clemens3> and 3.0 also vs 2.7
[20:35:25] <clemens3> adam12: yes, but it doesn't have it, or nobody is using, so not tested

[20:36:02] <clemens3> python just as slow, so also gets the heat from go
[20:42:59] <adam12> I'm finding Ruby more enjoyable now than I did 10+ years ago.
[20:44:49] <adam12> Types and the new debugger might make it more palatable for the Ruby developers who prefer the IDE experience.

[20:54:50] <michigan> I can't believe how dumb I was 10 years ago

[21:05:21] <adam12> I definitely see it's use cases, but there was a time where it was incredibly overused.
[21:05:41] <adam12> If you get a chance to read Jeremy Evans new book, Polished Ruby, he touches on it.
[21:08:26] <ccooke> It's the usual thing of just because something is easy doesn't make it the right tool

[22:59:11] <caleb> Ruby will live a very long useful life. There's a decent amount of high quality seasoned engineers, practices, libraries, and institutions behind it. It will very much last at least the next decade or two in high profile companies.
