[10:11:16] <jaggz> can I match a pattern for a custom html element, like  <page_toc>  <page_comments>
[10:11:27] <jaggz> so I want   page_* { display: block; }
[10:12:24] <jaggz> this is because I am trying to make most of the stuff block items, and was using:  page * { } to get them all, but then the elements like <i> end up also becoming blocks
[10:13:04] <jaggz> so I then tried page > * {} to get the initial children only, which almost works, but I have some variation in element depth in the tree
[10:13:06] <pavonia> You can't partly match on tag names, if this is what you're asking for

[23:09:04] <hassoon> I was told that the search form in the news list is 'very simple' and needs to be changed, wtf is that supposed to mean ? https://i.imgur.com/eEPo4lU.png
[23:09:38] <hassoon> it seems to me fine and usable, in term of layout/appearance
[23:10:53] <hmw[at]> Needs moar Captcha
[23:11:07] <hmw[at]> Someone complained, that it is too simple??
[23:11:15] <hmw[at]> Or has too little features?
[23:11:51] <hassoon> hmw[at]: ya that's all i got from this document sent to me by a coworker
[23:12:14] <hassoon> i had it with this stupid disorganised company
[23:12:20] <hmw[at]> I take it it wasn't written in English?
[23:12:26] <hassoon> and they have been confusing me for a UX designer/infographist
[23:12:27] <hmw[at]> (that message)
[23:12:46] <hassoon> hmw[at]: ya it was in french, but ya that's what it means in english
[23:13:00] <hassoon> 'search form is very simplistc, it needs to be changed'
[23:13:05] <hmw[at]> the list is very simple
[23:13:07] <hassoon> * simplistic *
[23:13:11] <hmw[at]> they said "list"
[23:13:16] <hmw[at]> they might refer to the results
[23:13:34] <hmw[at]> they look a bit simple (not that I'd see a problem there)
[23:13:46] <hmw[at]> What type of content is it?
[23:13:53] <hmw[at]> news?
[23:14:01] <hassoon> you mean the result pairs downside ?
[23:14:05] <hmw[at]> yes
[23:14:12] <hmw[at]> which is a list, while the form isn't
[23:14:52] <hmw[at]> "news list" ah
[23:14:55] <hmw[at]> hmm
[23:15:05] <hmw[at]> Certainly a job for a designer
[23:15:21] <hassoon> hmw[at]: nah they are talking about that form in the news list section, according to their document https://i.imgur.com/CRts4I2.png
[23:15:25] <hmw[at]> Are you stuck with the task of solving the issue?
[23:15:45] <hassoon> hmw[at]: ya they affected this shit to me recently
[23:15:56] <hassoon> hmw[at]: and i'm trying to focus on finding another job
[23:16:06] <hmw[at]> Reasonable :)
[23:17:41] <hassoon> hmw[at]: they notified me that they are going to lay me off soon, since there is nothing left for me to do in the company
[23:18:03] <hassoon> hmw[at]: but they gave me this even sillier and weirder task
[23:19:40] <hmw[at]> SOme confusion on my side; Google translates "consider a single display for all sources"
[23:19:52] <hmw[at]> perhaps the opposite is meant, it is too complicated?
[23:20:06] <hassoon> i leave my whole frontend speciality and give them "some CSS enhancements" on already deployed web apps
[23:20:12] <hassoon> this company is a joke
[23:20:47] <hassoon> i have been already seeking for a good and better job, but now this lay off thing is pushing me to be faster
[23:21:07] <hmw[at]> Best of luck

[23:22:26] <hassoon> hmw[at]: ya they simply..don't know what a frontend developer exactly does
[23:22:27] <hmw[at]> What about the weird contradiction though? Did you possibly misunderstand?
[23:22:44] <hassoon> and they confuse me for a graphic designer, lolz so funny
[23:22:47] <hassoon> what a mess
[23:23:00] <hassoon> hmw[at]: what contradiction ?
[23:23:22] <hmw[at]> Google translates "considerer un affichage unique pour toutes les sources" into "consider a single display for all sources"
[23:23:30] <hmw[at]> Sounds like they are complaining about it being too complicated
[23:23:59] <hmw[at]> It would make more sense than it being too simple
[23:24:01] <hassoon> hmw[at]: ah yes, they are targetting images, videos, like/dislike buttons there

[23:29:34] <hmw[at]> There are sketches about translators between managers and workers
[23:29:43] <hmw[at]> It's quite a stereotype actually
[23:29:49] <hassoon> ya i told the so called project manager of this mess that i'm going to try to suggest CSS enhancements and that's it, they will get in touch with their client later
[23:29:56] <hmw[at]> I'd like to know, if you find out what they really mean
[23:30:11] <hassoon> alright
[23:30:21] <hmw[at]> above they ask for another "search bar"
[23:30:43] <hassoon> hmw[at]: i'll make the search bar text input iconized at least
[23:30:51] <hassoon> and round its corners or something
[23:30:58] <hmw[at]> Clever use of colors might help, too
[23:31:03] <hassoon> ya
[23:31:12] <hmw[at]> But I'd guess it would be about functionality, not looks
[23:34:03] <hassoon> ah
[23:34:12] <hassoon> i guess i see now
[23:34:18] <hmw[at]> I am struggling with a customer myself, too. He seems to be friends with a local hosting provider, or at least he likes them. They are always nice on the phone, but seem not to listen. I still can't really use that so called "error log", it is empty all the time.
[23:34:44] <hmw[at]> I suggested getting a better company, but that isn't going to happen. I have NO IDEA why that fucking newsletter PHP script, I wrote, is failing
[23:34:47] <hassoon> the search bar done by whoever coded the app is a simple input, no suggestions list, no search icon nothing

[23:35:11] <hmw[at]> ah yes. I can see the potential improvements now too
[23:35:29] <hassoon> for the suggestions list, that's not css work imo
[23:35:37] <hmw[at]> certainly not
[23:35:39] <hmw[at]> lol
[23:35:42] <hassoon> lel
[23:36:00] <hassoon> maybe i can intercept xmlHttpRequest calls, and render a suggestion list by myself
[23:36:03] <hmw[at]> If your expertise is that broad, why not also take over that managing position while you're at it?
[23:36:07] <hassoon> but...meh why should i do that
[23:36:25] <hassoon> whoever wrote the app should render a suggestions list
[23:36:45] <hmw[at]> I really like my customer, we have become friends over the many years, I have managed his page. But he is dumb in this case
[23:36:46] <hassoon> hmw[at]: what managing postion ?
[23:37:03] <hassoon> hmw[at]: are you an independant freelancer ?
[23:37:06] <hmw[at]> yes
[23:37:09] <hmw[at]> kind of
[23:37:18] <hassoon> do you earn enough from it ?
[23:37:25] <hmw[at]> I have only that one customer left
[23:37:30] <hassoon> ah i see
[23:37:39] <hmw[at]> It is fine. I don't get too much, but I really enjoy working on that page
[23:37:58] <hmw[at]> He trusts me on technical questions, so I am not forced to implement stupid things etc
[23:38:07] <hassoon> i see, it's nice when you're having fun and not worried about getting more
[23:38:21] <hmw[at]> But that bad virtual server is annoying
[23:38:40] <hassoon> same thing, i have a friend that i take care of his website, and i earn something from her, from time to time
[23:38:41] <hmw[at]> And the company seems incompetent. I told them several times, nothing ever happens
[23:38:49] <hassoon> * her website *
[23:39:03] <hmw[at]> They're nice on the phone and all. Also I like supporting locals
[23:39:06] <hassoon> working with her is much better than working with these monkeys man
[23:39:10] <hmw[at]>  /rant
[23:39:15] <hmw[at]> Yeah
[23:39:24] <hmw[at]> Perhaps you can get into freelancing
[23:40:54] <hassoon> hmw[at]: thing is.. i need to become a sate recognized independant worker or something, you know like some kind of party with a registered patent
[23:41:08] <hassoon> hmw[at]: do'nt you have that
[23:41:09] <hassoon> ?
[23:41:38] <hmw[at]> IT is a "free business" in Austria. You only have to register as a "single person company" without needing to proove you have learned it
[23:41:58] <hassoon> ah yes something very similar to that
[23:42:11] <hmw[at]> and below a certain threshold, you can work without registering
[23:42:25] <hmw[at]> (I think you can earn about 400€ as a private person)
[23:42:54] <hassoon> yes that's the idea from what i read around here too, true, there are levels of threshold
[23:43:10] <hmw[at]> The only thing is, you need to do your homework well, for your finances, taxes etc
[23:44:11] <hassoon> hmw[at]: ya indeed, that's the part i need to know about, i don't know it good enough for now, i need to learn about how the finances and taxes work for single person companies around here
[23:44:27] <hmw[at]> I suppose, that will not be too hard
[23:44:43] <hmw[at]> Just check the law, and calculate your minimum hourly rate
[23:45:01] <hmw[at]> For me it is at 65€/h, that I can survive
[23:45:13] <hmw[at]> or that was the number 10 years ago, when I did these calculations
[23:45:44] <hmw[at]> (insurance, unemployment, being sick, holidays, improving home, etc)
[23:46:27] <hmw[at]> When I did this for the first time long ago, it didn't end very well :)
[23:46:43] <hassoon> you lost your customer s?
[23:46:43] <hmw[at]> I was forced into self-employment and was very naive
[23:46:45] <hassoon> *s ?
[23:46:50] <hassoon> ah
[23:46:58] <hmw[at]> no, i got into debt with the state's finance departemt
[23:47:23] <hmw[at]> They were nice to me tho, when I went there to try and solve things. Guess I was lucky.
[23:47:33] <hassoon> ya fortunately so
[23:47:57] <hassoon> you didn't pay taxes/finances or something ?
[23:48:28] <hmw[at]> Yes, I forgot about a specific thing. Had no idea. I was young and clueless and didn't even want to be self employed
[23:48:50] <hmw[at]> The company was quite shitty to their "non employees"
[23:49:13] <hassoon> what company ? you mean the company that hired you as a freelancer ?
[23:49:26] <hmw[at]> Yes. I was teaching ECDL for them in their offices
[23:49:55] <hmw[at]> It was fake freelancing though
[23:50:09] <hmw[at]> and the pay was not really good, but I didn't realize at the beginning
[23:51:01] <hmw[at]> Scummy company. They are now hired by the state to "educate" unemployed people
[23:51:13] <hassoon> ah i see
[23:51:34] <hmw[at]> I can see how they are the cheapest on the market :)
[23:51:44] <hmw[at]> Fuck "externalization"
[23:52:09] <hmw[at]> I should have charged them about 2x or 3x the amount
[23:52:14] <hmw[at]> without beeing greedy
[23:52:46] <hmw[at]> It was awesome though to teach. My groups were actively interested in the stuff, although it was Office crap
[23:53:37] <hassoon> did they get into dept or something ? they are the company who scam people you know
[23:53:45] <hmw[at]> Most of them did never use a computer before. Imagine that. (15 years ago)
[23:53:58] <hmw[at]> and one of them was an electronics engineer. He helped me.
