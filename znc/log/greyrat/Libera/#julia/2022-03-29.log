[03:15:48] <^[> mikko: The model zoo (https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo) has some examples.
[03:39:18] <mikko> that's actually where i got the code that got me into trouble in the first place :D
[03:40:45] <mikko> my data was different shape than the dataset the example i looked at used and it took some trial and error to figure out how the data and inputs/outputs of the network should be shaped
[03:43:14] <mikko> for now i just flattened 8x8 grayscale images into 64 x N matrix, i'll try to figure out the convolution part another day

[15:16:38] <mikko> how would you implement a way to interrupt an infinite loop in julia (preferably without abusing sigint)?
[15:17:32] <mikko> i have this neural net training thing going on and it would be nice if i could manually stop it
[15:19:07] <mikko> the best thing that comes to my mind is writing into a file from another process and periodically checking that file somewhere inside the training loop, and that sounds megastupid
[15:22:33] <furrymcgee> break?
[15:23:22] <mikko> yeah but the problem is how do i tell it to break when i want to
[15:25:32] <furrymcgee> yes the problem is you didnt say when you want to
[15:25:39] <mikko> manually
[15:25:48] <furrymcgee> poweroff?
[15:26:11] <mikko> no, i mean gracefully breaking so i can do stuff with the model
[15:26:39] <mikko> in python i would connect a keypress into a signal handler
[15:27:01] <mikko> but i don't think(?) julia has stuff like that at least in standard library
[15:31:40] <furrymcgee> you could read read stdin until end of file
[15:32:33] <mikko> no but the whole point is the neural net training process is going on the whole time, i can't do blocking operations
[15:33:07] <mikko> i really need something asynchronous
[15:33:45] <mikko> as in the (stupid) idea i had about writing to a file from another process and then checking it periodically inside the loop
[15:33:58] <mikko> i'm sure there's a better way :)
[15:49:46] <adigitoleo> not much more than sigint at the moment I think. Might be better to run the thing until a predefined checkpoint and have a way to resume
[15:50:28] <mikko> hmm i guess that's a decent work-around
[15:50:30] <furrymcgee> posix has select and poll
[15:56:54] <furrymcgee> there is a timeout in poll_fd as well as in poll_file https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/FileWatching/#FileWatching.poll_fd

[19:03:30] <ninjin> If you are doing “proper” model training, you should be dumping weights to file at some interval and be able to resume from them. This would largely eliminate the need for any fancy pausing.
