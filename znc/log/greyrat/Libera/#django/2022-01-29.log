[19:28:18] <GinFuyou> Shoukrun, https://dpaste.org/
[19:30:38] <Shoukrun> Hello! I am relatively new to Django and have created my first live project. I am currently going through my code to refactor it and know that this logic can be written in a much more concise and clear way. I am working my way through it and was wondering if you had any pointers on simplying the logic https://dpaste.org/RSMy
[19:35:05] <GinFuyou> Shoukrun, looks like you'd want to use some kind of list and/or dict for your vars instead of going through them manually
[19:35:58] *** Quits: dor (~erg@78.11.12.207) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[19:37:51] <Shoukrun> Makes sense. What variables specifically are you referring to?
[19:38:58] <hzm74> Hello everyone, i´m trying to send the value of a html date-element in a form to the view.
[19:40:59] <hzm74> With tags in my template i made a list of model-objects with in front of it checkboxes. The user can select model-records and select a new date.
[19:42:09] <hzm74> The new date-value is sended to my view-function ¨update_document¨. But when i debug i see that al value of ´None´ is sended to my function ?!!
[19:42:49] <hzm74> This is my coding: http://dpaste.org/jbzB

[19:47:48] <GinFuyou> Shoukrun, is code like lines 65-77 repeats with only "*_variableX" changing X ?

[19:50:04] <GinFuyou> hzm74, why you not using a form here? Anyway form data is send with keys from "name" attribute, not ID. You need to add that attr to date input
[19:53:23] <hzm74> GinFuyou, thnx! Changing to ´name´ attribute did the job.
[19:54:53] <hzm74> GinFuyou, i´m using a html-form in my template. Do you mean why i´m not using a django modelform(s)?
[19:55:43] <GinFuyou> yes, django forms.Form or .ModelForm
[19:57:07] <hzm74> GinFuyou, would like to use that but hard time to set that up correctly. Gonna try to put it together with django modelforms.
[19:58:00] <hzm74> With modelforms the data is checked with django form-validation. So that would be a big advantage.
[19:58:34] <GinFuyou> not sure what is hard here, I think I said before it's a form with 2 field, a multiplemodelchoice for Vloeren and datumnew for date
[19:59:44] <GinFuyou> If you can reuse it's as modelform, than it should make less work too, can't say on the spot, I don't remember your models clearly
[20:01:36] <hzm74> GinFuyou, you said that indeed before. But with a multiplemodelchoice element i get a dropdownbox? With a big list of modelrecords that is not user friendly to select the right document? With the list i now have in my template the user can filter on name to search for specific modelrecords.
[20:03:41] <GinFuyou> hzm74, you get multiselect *by default*. You can just leave your current code only adjusting inputs to have names matching Form fields names. Django doesn't care how form was rendered or was it rendered at all
[20:04:17] <GinFuyou> Only what matters is that it gets dict-like structure with certain keys
[20:05:49] <hzm74> Thnx for the reply. Gonna try to set it up like you said.

[22:02:28] <Shoukrun> GinFuyou How do I get value of list(variable_weight_dictionary.values())[0] based on the for loop iteration it's on (line 59). For example, the first time it processes the for specific_variable in specific_variable_dictionary.values(): (line 51) I want it to pull [0] from list(variable_weight_dictionary.values()) and the second time it goes through
[22:02:28] <Shoukrun> that for loop I want it to pull [1]
[22:03:16] <GinFuyou> how it's classically done in coding

[22:07:14] <GinFuyou> I was thinking more like a list of dicts, where every dict contains all iterating values
[22:08:07] <Shoukrun> GinFuyou: I was wondering if it was different since I have a for loop within a for loop and I want the line of code that is within my second for loop to incrememnt based on the first loop iteration
[22:08:24] <Shoukrun> That was put in a confusing way so I hope my dpaste clears it up

[22:10:45] <GinFuyou> I'm not quite following... you made specific_variable_dictionary a dict, but you are basically using it as a list getting .values()
[22:11:00] <Shoukrun> Yes I agree and think I should change it to a list
[22:12:24] <GinFuyou> why you need to loop over cities?
[22:13:18] <GinFuyou> You also don't need Q() for AND clauses, it's default for filter()
[22:16:13] <Shoukrun> My thought process was say that for "specific_variable1" the user selects "expensive" and for "specific_variable2" the user selects "hot".
[22:16:13] <Shoukrun> I have a database of cities that contain an "affordability" column and within that each city either has a value of "expensive" or "affordable" as well as a "climate" column and within that the value is "hot" or "cold".
[22:16:14] <Shoukrun> Since "specific_variable1" has a weighting of 0.33 and "specific_variable2" has a weighting of 0.24. For "specific_variable1" I want to find all cities that have that and give them a value of 0.33. Same for "specific_variable2" except they will have a value of 0.24. Then I will rank the list of cities based on their total value
[22:16:44] <Shoukrun> GinFuyou Thanks for that info, I will remove Q()

[22:36:34] <GinFuyou> Ok, I'll go sketching on the go. So what if we had object like [{'lookup_parameter': 'climate', 'value': 'hot'}, {'lookup_parameter': 'affordability', 'value': 'expensive'}]
[22:39:19] *** Joins: ezarowny (~ezarowny@2600:1700:4090:4e8f:d97e:f0a9:1a26:7245)
[22:39:21] <GinFuyou> Shoukrun, specific variable weight is based on position in form? I mean speicific_var1 = 0.33 or specific_var['affordability'] = 0.33 ?
[22:40:52] <Shoukrun> Position in form. So specifiv_variable1 = 0.33, specific_variable2 = 0.24
[22:41:31] <GinFuyou> anyway it looks like we could make a base city_queryset and then add annotations to it in a loop
[22:41:45] <GinFuyou> instead of using flat values list

[23:32:08] *** Quits: nicode (~nic@45.72.226.166) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:32:15] <myii[m]> I've seen these references: https://github.com/django/django/pull/8751 & https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28349.
[23:33:29] <myii[m]> Quoting the key point: "The recommended way to upgrade from LTS to LTS is to upgrade one major version at a time, e.g. 1.8.x -> 1.9.y -> 1.10.z -> 1.11.a."
[23:34:54] *** Joins: ezarowny (~ezarowny@2600:1700:4090:4e8f:cc14:55ff:e366:ed91)
[23:35:15] <myii[m]> So referring to 2.2 => 3.2, the suggestion is 2.2 => 3.0 => 3.1 => 3.2.
[23:38:20] <myii[m]> The issue is that 2.2.26 (2022-01-04) was released a long time after 3.0.14 (2021-04-06) and even after 3.1.14 (2021-12-07).  So isn't this upgrading by going through "older" versions?

[23:40:02] <GinFuyou> why does it matter?
[23:40:59] <myii[m]> Because there are newer features and fixes that have been added to the 2.2 series since 3.0 has hit EOL.
[23:41:24] <GinFuyou> No, it doesn't add new features.
[23:42:01] <GinFuyou> there might be bug fixes and security patches that made to LTS but not into higher version
[23:42:28] <GinFuyou> But if you don't stay on it in production, it shouldn't matter
[23:44:16] <myii[m]> So relating to migrations, for example.  There are no migrations that have been applied in the 2.2 series that aren't available in the 3.0 and 3.1 series?
[23:44:31] <myii[m]> I suppose I'm asking -- isn't it safer to upgrade straight from 2.2 => 3.2?

[23:53:23] <GinFuyou> myii[m], quite sure there none. safer to go in 0.1 steps. Surely I can see probability of bug that wasn't backported to newer non-LTS version that may break your test
[23:53:58] <GinFuyou> then it's probably a reason to skip through this version. But I don't find it very likely
[23:54:44] <myii[m]> GinFuyou: Hmm, thanks for your feedback.  I'll take it into consideration.
[23:57:37] *** Quits: READ10 (~weechat@user/read10) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:57:59] <myii[m]> GinFuyou: One thing I will say, though — when it comes to upgrade time, it feels like it would have been much easier just to upgrade through all of the minor versions immediately, since you really have to go through them anyway from LTS to LTS.
