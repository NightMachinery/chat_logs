[01:58:29] <MootPoot> without wobbling the fuck out
[01:58:43] <ButterNoodle> yea nature of the round
[01:58:44] <MootPoot> I can get if it just dropped straight down in a clean arc, I can deal with that
[01:58:51] <MootPoot> but it just fucking starts doing disco
[01:59:13] <MootPoot> some old guy told me to load my casings with 303 british rounds
[01:59:19] <MootPoot> 150gr heavy bois
[01:59:21] <ButterNoodle> its probably moving real slow at that range
[02:00:00] <ButterNoodle> yea.. rule #1.. never take reloading advice from anyone seriously
[02:00:27] <brainwash> follow the instructions
[02:00:34] <MootPoot> he told me any 30 or 301-302 cal should do just fine
[02:00:35] <ButterNoodle> there is probably some good test data on hodgdons website
[02:00:40] <ButterNoodle> incorrect
[02:00:50] <MootPoot> probably 30 since I have a tighter barrel then most surplus
[02:01:01] <ButterNoodle> thats how u end up with a well ventilated breech and a few fingers missing
[02:01:28] <brainwash> why is having pepper spray legal in all US states?
[02:01:30] <ButterNoodle> if its not in any reloading manual, dont attempt it
[02:01:37] <ButterNoodle> brainwash: we like spicy food?
[02:01:55] <brainwash> indian food with some slurpees?
[02:01:59] <MootPoot> I was reading fourms and people were saying that its not really possible to overpressure 762x39 since the smol case
[02:02:05] <ButterNoodle> $5 slurpees
[02:02:07] <MootPoot> idk if true
[02:02:13] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: bet
[02:02:27] <ButterNoodle> if I put some hotter powder in there its ggez
[02:02:35] * MootPoot sees the 5 dollar slurpee sign behind the gas station
[02:02:40] <brainwash> does that mean that most women in the US are armed with pepper spray?
[02:02:45] <MootPoot> I doubt its true
[02:03:03] <MootPoot> the surplus and the first party rounds I buy if you shake em you can hear the powder
[02:03:09] <MootPoot> presumably there is some air space in there
[02:03:53] * MootPoot sees that winter is coming
[02:04:00] <MootPoot> lots of weekends in the garage I guess
[02:04:08] <MootPoot> I want a reloading kit
[02:04:10] <MootPoot> not too $$
[02:04:20] <ButterNoodle> get a lee single stage
[02:04:24] <MootPoot> just wanna do 762x39 and maybe 3006/308win
[02:04:57] <brainwash> "Man with no arms commits armed robbery"
[02:04:59] <MootPoot> so I need a press, and then dies for my caliber right?
[02:05:32] <ButterNoodle> a lee single stage, the Franklin arms primer tool, and a good scale - I'd suggest a powder throw and balance beam
[02:05:44] <ButterNoodle> and dies.. carbide dies or u will need to use lube
[02:05:51] <MootPoot> woah
[02:05:51] <MootPoot> lube
[02:05:52] <ButterNoodle> 3 die set
[02:06:33] <MootPoot> so aside from accuracy, I probably cant squeeze out any more range from 762x39 then current new factory ammo provides
[02:06:48] <ButterNoodle> yea there is plenty of room to overcharge 762..
[02:07:29] <ButterNoodle> you could spin some actual 150gr that are tested w it.. but ud need to plug that data in a calculator to see if that buys you any more distance
[02:07:41] <ButterNoodle> you will see tremendous consistency when u load urself
[02:08:17] <ButterNoodle> I'd bet that 762 is probably loaded with a few grains of accuracy... but you can get .1 grain on ur hand loads with patience
[02:08:27] <ButterNoodle> which will be more consistent fps
[02:08:39] <ButterNoodle> u also need a crono.. or why bother
[02:08:48] <MootPoot> damn
[02:08:55] <MootPoot> sounds like almost 1000 bucks in gear
[02:09:07] <ButterNoodle> just looking at the case for over pressure signs isnt good enough u know
[02:09:11] <ButterNoodle> meh
[02:09:15] <ButterNoodle> 5-600
[02:09:43] <ButterNoodle> plus supplies

[02:12:13] <MootPoot> seems like even making custom loads its not much better
[02:12:39] <MootPoot> at best I get like 20% less drop after the round hits the 350y mark where the arcing starts
[02:12:40] <MootPoot> rip
[02:12:58] <ButterNoodle> its not the drop thats the problem.. its the consistency
[02:13:08] <ButterNoodle> I mean unless ur going subsonic at that point

[02:14:06] <MootPoot> looking at the graph for the 123gr
[02:14:17] <MootPoot> just about when the major drop starts is where it goes subsonic
[02:14:22] <MootPoot> maybe thats why its all wobbly 
[02:14:28] <ButterNoodle> strange shit happens when the loose velocity below supersonic speeds

[05:48:27] <Toadisattva> amigojapan, when you moved to Japan did you just fly over with a couple bags and start from scratch there?
[05:51:14] <amigojapan> Yeah Toadisattva I brought a large belise(Is that even a word in English?) and a small toat bag. What I regret is that I left my anime collection in the US and my grandmother gave it away to kids

[10:56:24] <Nanobot> I think the HoloEN-HoloJP Minecraft server merge is going to be a shitshow. The talents clearly haven't been told all the details they need to know about the merge. A lot of them are still under the impression that there will still be two separate servers. Some of them aren't aware that their inventory, armor, and ender chest contents will be lost. I'm not sure they realize that they'll need to log into the HoloJP server from now on, and that they'll 
[10:56:24] <Nanobot> start off wherever they last were on the HoloJP server. I'm worried that they'll keep trying to connect to the old HoloEN server and will try to play there (anything they do there after the merge will be lost).
[10:57:01] <Nanobot> And then there's the whole possibility of entities getting lost during the merge. I haven't heard anyone mention that, but it's a common issue that can happen.

[12:40:56] <darkwitch> I only use twitter for the images and don't care about the text
[12:41:39] <brainwash> but twitter is about short texts
[12:42:47] <Katrin> brainwash: Yes, I am spreading the message that the risk of taking the vaccine is lower than the risk of getting covid complications
[12:43:03] <Katrin> And that everyone who can get vaccinated safely should do so
[12:43:26] <Katrin> Because that is the only way we can protect those that cannot be vaccinated
[12:43:40] <brainwash> sounds like bullshit to me
[12:43:44] <Katrin> Or those that don't responde to the vaccine because of a weak immune system.
[12:44:07] <Katrin> brainwash: You can look at the stats and come to a conclusion yourself obviously
[12:44:17] <brainwash> yes, you should do that
[12:44:22] <Katrin> But you are going to say that government sources are bogus anyways
[12:44:45] <brainwash> young people have a very very low risk, children a very very very very low rish
[12:44:53] <brainwash> age matters
[12:45:18] <brainwash> what matters is that old people (50+) are vaccinated
[12:45:24] <Katrin> How is that related to what I am talking about?
[12:45:37] <brainwash> you mentioned the rish
[12:45:41] <brainwash> risk

[12:46:53] <brainwash> not everyone has the same risk %
[12:46:56] <Katrin> Whether or not kids are at risk does not matter for this argument, we are talking about healthy adults that refuse to get vaccinated to protect others
[12:47:35] <Katrin> And it's a poor choice, because the risks of an infection are higher than the vaccine risks even in young adults
[12:47:41] <brainwash> the CDC tells us that you can still spread the virus as vaccinated person
[12:47:58] <Katrin> But you are far less likely to contract it in the first place
[12:48:04] <brainwash> after 6 months you even needs a 3rd dose

[16:14:33] <amigojapan> Katrin: closest thing I have is a video with 22k views
[16:14:47] <amigojapan> YouTube video
[16:15:03] <Katrin> amigojapan: that is a lot, I already get exited about a few dozen likes within a few hours
[16:15:33] <Katrin> I deleted my first twitter account the moment I got more than two diget followers
[16:15:45] <amigojapan> Katrin: be careful, sounds unhealthy
[16:15:52] <Katrin> amigojapan: very much so
[16:16:11] <Katrin> amigojapan: I might accidentally become a "social media activist" 
[16:16:41] <Katrin> I should rather spend my time on real direct action activism and occupy some houses
[16:17:01] <amigojapan> Katrin: I rather not become famous
[16:17:11] <amigojapan> No privacy
[16:17:24] <Katrin> amigojapan: you don't really become famous for occupiying a house or two either
[16:17:26] <Katrin> these days
[16:17:33] <zoidberg> Katrin: and twitter doesn't actually help, when the tweet is popular, it sends notification saying your tweet is popular

[16:18:13] <Katrin> zoidberg: I already disabled notifications haha
[16:18:15] <amigojapan> Katrin: I want my projects to become famous tho

[16:19:27] <amigojapan> Katrin: I already have them 3dpl and s-found
[16:19:48] <zoidberg> Katrin: nah, I wouldn't say that. Most of my tweets are about Wodehouse.
[16:20:00] <zoidberg> or Wodehouse's quotes
[16:20:11] <zoidberg> or praising Wodehouse's prose
[16:20:13] <Katrin> zoidberg: I tweet about whatever and make stupid jokes
[16:20:38] <amigojapan> Katrin: I hardly use Twitter at all

[16:23:20] <zoidberg> Katrin: I don't click on trending tags
[16:23:26] <listenurs> yea its a good thing overall since its basically lightening fast journalism
[16:23:43] <zoidberg> I am afraid that twitter would suggest more of them if I click them
[16:24:55] <zoidberg> I am active in couple of groups. One is Wodehouse and another Simpsons
[16:24:58] <amigojapan> Twitter seems like a place for attention seekers, altho attention seeking is probably a natural human need
[16:25:03] <zoidberg> both are lots of fun
[16:25:34] <zoidberg> playing out episodes in quotes
[16:26:28] <amigojapan> zoidberg: the God guy was funny

[17:04:24] <Katrin> amigojapan: the one I linked was an AI based on a popular parody account
[17:04:30] <emmeka> yeah, I've been working my way slowly through it. it's ok.
[17:04:56] <DunceCotus> ok? It's glorious
[17:05:27] <emmeka> Sonny Boy is basically Lord of the Flies with some surrealism and dimensional shifting thrown in for style points
[17:05:28] <Katrin> amigojapan: so I don't think it is serious, because the account it learned from is already not serious.
[17:05:38] <emmeka> it is perfectly watcheable, but it hasn't impressed me
[17:05:52] <amigojapan> Katrin: really AI? Sounded convincing
[17:05:55] <DunceCotus> its so much more than Lord of the Flies
[17:06:10] <emmeka> it's literally Lord of the Flies, though.
[17:06:19] <DunceCotus> its so, so much more
[17:06:25] <Katrin> amigojapan: They have new models that work quite well in terms of producing credible sounding writing.
[17:06:35] <emmeka> yes, the surrealism and dimensional shifting thrown in for style points
[17:06:50] <amigojapan> Katrin: I guess like aidungeon
[17:06:53] <emmeka> like the show has a reasonable setup, so far (I'm like 4 episodes in?) it has done nothing with it
[17:06:54] <Katrin> amigojapan: You can even have AI write a porn script for you, which is just hillarious
[17:07:07] <DunceCotus> emmeka: it gets better TM
[17:07:16] <Katrin> I mean, some of the online AIs just seem to turn everything you throw at it into porn somehow
[17:07:17] <Katrin> xD
[17:07:26] <emmeka> I'm unconvinced, but I'm not dropping it anyway, so don't worry
[17:07:52] <DunceCotus> like its not perfect
[17:08:09] <emmeka> it feels like one of those shows which is trying way to hard to be artful and in the process got way too far up its own ass
[17:08:47] <DunceCotus> I think not
[17:08:54] <amigojapan> Katrin: are you sure it is not just a person calling itself AI like kizuna AI?
[17:08:59] <DunceCotus> it has just the right amount of artful
[17:09:10] <emmeka> amigojapan uh. isn't Ai supposed to be her name.
[17:09:27] <emmeka> like last name Kizuna first name Ai
[17:09:43] <amigojapan> emmeka: yes but she also claims to be AI
[17:10:02] <Katrin> amigojapan: Yes it is a real AI based on a GPT-3 model

[18:21:05] <emmeka> well sure, it's episodic.

[18:22:17] <emmeka> Vivy is ordered to go and stop some sort of AI development, in the process meets some new characters who provide us some new insight into the AIs or AI/human relationships, she'll clash with the terrorists a bit and we get some badass animation, and then there's a timeskip. rinse repeat.
[18:23:00] <groovy> yes I watched it 
[18:23:19] <groovy> episodic doesn't mean it has to be the exact same thing every time

[20:46:06] <Katrin> The modern life style makes people more vurnerable to mental disorders

[23:44:13] <Bco1981> just check your PSU what it can handle, if it has 6pin or 8pin pcie cables.
[23:44:17] <emmeka> oh, so I could just get a GPU and like, a new power supply I guess, and it'd be fine? I wasn't really sure how that'd work with there being onboard graphics

[23:49:34] <MootPoot> the new apus are like in the gtx 1050 ti territory afaik

[23:49:59] <emmeka> and I was thinking like, would it be better to just get that, or can I just tack discrete graphics on, or what
[23:51:36] <brainwash> I assume that your power unit is on the weaker side
[23:51:45] <brainwash> or?
[23:51:52] <brainwash> like 200W?

[23:53:30] <emmeka> Bco1981 no, it's not as if I have any real knowledge of it, I just know to buy AMD since I exclusively run linux
[23:53:31] <Bco1981> but that wouldn't be a upgrade

[23:54:33] <Bco1981> but might be hard to get.
[23:54:45] <brainwash> that one is around 500 euros (when lucky)
[23:54:46] <brainwash> no?
[23:54:50] <brainwash> probably more
[23:55:10] <MootPoot> as long as the gpu is not viable anymore for mining it should be possible
[23:55:19] <MootPoot> I wonder what the prices are on like gtx 970s
[23:55:23] <emmeka> Bco1981 I will make a note of that. But, is my idea of just replacing the APU a bad one
[23:55:32] <brainwash> one could aim for an old gtx 960
[23:55:49] <MootPoot> wtf
[23:55:58] <MootPoot> gtx 970s are going for 200-300 bucks cad
[23:55:59] <MootPoot> all in
[23:56:00] <Bco1981> emmeka: it really depends on what you have for cpu, and what you plan to play.
[23:56:01] <MootPoot> with shipping
[23:56:31] <emmeka> Bco1981 like 90% of what I play is 2D and I have no real issue with turning things down to lower graphics quality
[23:56:49] <brainwash> then why do you even need an upgrade? :)
