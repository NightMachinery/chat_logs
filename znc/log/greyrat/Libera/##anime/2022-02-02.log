[07:15:23] <Nanobot> An NFT is like an autograph. Or, potentially, a token that the issuer can choose to honor, which can be traded to others without involving that issuer.
[07:15:25] <MootPoot> I COULD see NFTs being used as some kind of authentiation token / system for logins online but
[07:15:26] <Sadale> I find the use of blockchain for BTC makes sense because it creates a transaction system. But for NFT? That's bulllshit.
[07:15:39] <MootPoot> the picture shit today is dumb
[07:15:58] <Sadale> auth token huh? Why the fuck would you even want to use NFT for that?

[07:16:32] <Sadale> davic, ah. You're gonna lose your nose-virginity
[07:16:40] <MootPoot> Sadale: I could see it as like , say you have a company that wants 10 employees who need access to just one intenral website
[07:16:40] <Nanobot> For example, Blizzard could offer an NFT that represents a particular mount, and offer a way to submit proof of possession of that NFT to automatically transfer the mount from one account to another. That allows you to trade the mount to others without using Blizzard's own systems. But Blizzard still has to choose to honor it.
[07:16:46] <davic> Sadale: I easily get nosebleed
[07:16:50] <MootPoot> so like you create NFT to represent 10 login keys
[07:17:09] <MootPoot> that's the only possible actual use I can think of it
[07:17:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, Hold on. Does NFT even store encrypted data?
[07:17:34] <Sadale> Isn't the content of NFT actually public?
[07:17:56] <Nanobot> I haven't looked into the guts of how NFTs work, but I always assumed an NFT can store a hash at best. There's no way something that stores the *actual data* could ever scale.
[07:18:13] <davic> Nanobot: pls
[07:18:14] <davic> storj
[07:18:15] <MootPoot> afaik you can cross refence with where you store it, and the issuer would honor that transaction by letting you login

[07:54:48] <Nanobot> No, I would be more interested in higher-level algorithms. When I interviewed for my current job, I was asked to write some code (real or pseudo, didn't matter, they just wanted to see my thought process) to lay out the dates of a month into a calendar layout.
[07:55:29] <MootPoot> hmm
[07:55:55] <MootPoot> okay -  I got a interview in ~18 hours and I'm just wondering what I can do to up my chances
[07:56:01] <Nanobot> You could assume that your datetime library could tell you the day of the week for a given date (like, as a number from 0 to 6).

[07:56:12] <MootPoot> I'm not the best at the traditional programming challenges , I usually just focus on building things
[07:56:18] <MootPoot> !b jbwncster 
[07:56:27] <jbwncster> Why?
[07:57:50] <Nanobot> In my whole life, I've only been in one interview that asked the candidate to demonstrate actual programming skills. That's not a statement about the likelihood of such questions, but more a statement of how lucky I've been.
[07:58:39] <jbwncster> MootPoot: ?
[07:58:48] <dfch> show us your google skills
[07:59:14] <jbwncster> Show us your W3 validator check skills
[07:59:43] <dfch> jbwncster, don't worry, MootPoot have no access to Suzuka and can't actually ban people here. He's joking :)
[07:59:53] <Nanobot> MootPoot: Whatever you get asked, the best thing is to demonstrate how you would go about solving it in an actual job situation. Don't just stare at the screen and panic, think about what you would do in practice. Worst-case scenario, you'd at least do some Google searches and not just freeze up.
[08:00:06] <MootPoot> so in short - presentation of my thought process might actually be more helpful then being able to do it directly
[08:00:14] <jbwncster> dfch: I wanted to know why though like thought process lol
[08:00:33] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u gonna be ok
[08:00:37] <MootPoot> panik
[08:00:41] <ButterNoodle> u research the company
[08:00:47] <ButterNoodle> make sure u ask a few questions
[08:00:51] <MootPoot> this is my 3rd interview with them
[08:01:04] <ButterNoodle> *do you have any questions for me?
[08:01:07] <ButterNoodle> think of a few
[08:01:09] <dfch> Nanobot, I'd say going for google is not worse case scenario, it actually a plus for me when I interview people
[08:01:09] <ButterNoodle> :)
[08:01:27] <MootPoot> I did a code project for them - they want this 3rd meeting to be me explaining how I did it and some unknown code challenges

[08:01:37] <Nanobot> If the interviewers don't suck, they should be more interested in your ability to figure out the correct answer using the tools available than simply knowing it off the top of your head.
[08:02:09] <dfch> especially if they try to circumvent GFW to access google during the interview

[08:08:07] <jbwncster> I’m watching Yashahime
[08:09:04] <Nanobot> Didn't Gura have a video where she was drawing stuff to try to prove that the Earth was flat or that the sun orbited the Earth or something like that? I can't seem to find it now. I only see the one where she was with Amelia.
[08:10:29] <Nanobot> Or wait.. was it Pekora?

[08:11:40] <MootPoot> why am I sleepy
[08:11:55] <MootPoot> I woke up at like 3-4pm
[08:12:50] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, did you eat?
[08:13:41] <MootPoot> I had some roast beef sandwiches a while ago
[08:14:17] <PancakeMatsuri> well, that might be it, though I'd think "awhile" more like 5-10 minutes
[08:14:42] <MootPoot> Nanobot: one wonders about the longevity of any building built by usada construction, when their CEO dosen't believe in gravity
[08:14:44] <PancakeMatsuri> I tend to get sleepy, when I eat carbs.
[08:14:51] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: it was like 3 hours ago - the carbs were low carb bread
[08:14:57] <MootPoot> had maybe like 7g in total
[08:15:01] <Nanobot> MootPoot: She was trolling, though
[08:15:03] <PancakeMatsuri> Then I eat protein, and voila, I'm not sleepy anymore
[08:15:12] <MootPoot> Nanobot: I know, its just the character
[08:15:15] <MootPoot> but still
[08:16:52] <dfch> MootPoot wait what? gravity? what's next, you gonna tell me birds are real? 
[08:17:04] <MootPoot> no, birds are fake
[08:17:11] <dfch> so is gravity duh
[08:17:31] <MootPoot> I shot a bird once with a rifle and the bullet went straight though - then the bird just flew off
[08:17:34] <MootPoot> like a hologram
[08:17:38] <MootPoot> preprogrammed to do that
[08:17:52] <dfch> nice, what game was that?

[09:28:56] <ButterNoodle> for spoofing ur mac address
[09:29:15] <ButterNoodle> its not really spoofing...
[09:29:25] <ButterNoodle> its probably randomizing it

[09:29:51] <ButterNoodle> u dont need that on an internal network

[09:30:26] <ButterNoodle> the only place I see its needed, if ur traveling and using different wifi networks.. having a random mac helps u be anonymous

[09:35:14] <amigojapan> Jesse that's why I keep a sticker with the password in my router
[09:36:56] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: dual booting is usually on different positions

[10:13:28] <ketchupicecream2> I had a couple hundred hours on dota2
[10:13:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: people shouting "gaijin" at him, giving dirty looks, people staring or being non-responsive when asked questions
[10:13:51] <Pseudocrat> Gaijin literally means foreigner - it's not a racist term. That's just what he was
[10:13:55] <DunceCotus> even when attempted to ask in Japanese
[10:13:59] <ketchupicecream2> Pseudocrat: then stopped playing cause i was getting no work done haha

[10:30:06] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there are both YouTubers that praise Japan and a few that love hating on it despite livid here. I don't get the letter ones
[10:30:19] <DunceCotus> I dunno see the problem is people see other young people getting sex in the media and their friends etc.
[10:30:22] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: ad revenue
[10:30:40] <DunceCotus> so they feel like they need to get sex and desperation leads to bad ways of doing that
[10:30:46] <ButterNoodle> we didnt have that in the early 90s
[10:30:51] <amigojapan> Yeah likely ButterNoodle 
[10:30:58] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[10:31:25] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: no sex in the early 90s?
[10:31:25] <ButterNoodle> I use to take girls out to get high when I was in high school all the time..
[10:31:31] <ButterNoodle> but
[10:31:43] <ButterNoodle> didnt want to rape them to get a nutt off
[10:32:00] <ButterNoodle> seems like jumping the shark
[10:32:14] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: the fact that girls would willingly go out with you means you're not at that level of desperation
[10:32:26] <DunceCotus> its the guys who girls don't/won't date
[10:32:31] <ButterNoodle> desperation != sexual assault tho
[10:32:37] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: doesn't it?
[10:32:48] <ButterNoodle> ask a 60 yo virgin
[10:33:04] <DunceCotus> okay some can live without
[10:33:09] <Sadale> Makes me wonder if there's stats in regard of virginity
[10:33:10] <ButterNoodle> ig lack of morals
[10:33:18] <DunceCotus> but I would say young people are pressured to have sex experience
[10:33:33] <DunceCotus> depends on culture tho.. sometimes its more a matter of bad masculinity
[10:33:35] <ButterNoodle> if u think its fine to take sex because u need it.. there is some other mental problems there
[10:33:54] <Sadale> lol I'm too isolated IRL to receive peer-pressure to have sex
[10:34:04] <Sadale> I'm like North Korea IRL xD

[13:32:33] <DunceCotus> there can be illegitimate desires
[13:32:44] <DunceCotus> which are more reactive desires
[13:33:00] <DunceCotus> and empty bodies of addiction
[13:33:05] <JesseDesu> i think DunceCotus is talking out of his ass without thinking
[13:33:11] <JesseDesu> sorry bud
[13:33:19] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: nope
[13:33:40] <DunceCotus> yes desire can be 'bad' from our point of view of good/bad
[13:33:59] <DunceCotus> but desire is impersonal, asubjective, it doesn't really care about our categorisations
[13:34:08] <JesseDesu> just like your desire to believe in flat earth
[13:34:08] <DunceCotus> what desire does always do however is produce
[13:34:37] <DunceCotus> I don't desire to believe in flat earth
[13:34:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: done desires need to be kept under control

[13:43:26] <KatrinValerie> I mean, I tried to quit coffee but even after a month it didn't improve my gastritis so I started drinking and enjoying coffee again.
[13:44:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: control within a certain mode of social production

[13:55:33] <KatrinValerie> Or like fun
[13:55:46] <KatrinValerie> Well, if you could turn into a tree at the end of your life
[13:55:52] <DunceCotus> humans probably have dna that keeps us at a certain age indefinitely
[13:55:59] <KatrinValerie> tbh, I am fine being nutrition to plants when my life ends
[13:56:02] <DunceCotus> or dna that makes us heal super fast and efficiently

[13:58:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but you'd be suppressing the tiger aspect
[13:58:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: and shelter
[13:58:22] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: how would you define your relationship to tigers?
[13:58:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that's ok
[13:59:00] <KatrinValerie> Is this like a spirit animal thing or more a furry thing?
[13:59:05] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: what do you mean. This is the year of the tiger
[13:59:10] <KatrinValerie> Ahahaha
[13:59:10] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think you just want free medical and shelter
[13:59:29] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I always think of super deep meaningful reasons behind mundane action :D

[13:59:37] <DunceCotus> :)
[13:59:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: yes medical. Shelter and food guaranteed for life would be nice
[13:59:54] <DunceCotus> becoming-tiger is a rather different line of flight
[14:00:06] <DunceCotus> but perhaps not a dissimilar trajectory
[14:00:40] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but if I were a beautiful tiger.i could make people at a zoo happy and have what I want

[14:17:33] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: they also ask me my blood type, which fortunately I don't know
[14:17:36] <DunceCotus> the death of despotic China also meant the death of all these symbols

[14:29:38] <DunceCotus> its open to interpretation.. its open to commercialisation
[14:30:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the meaning of the symbols, the coding, is no longer operative
[14:30:47] <DunceCotus> it refers to history likely lost to time
[14:31:08] <DunceCotus> to a social production that would be as alien to us now as well, actual alien societies

[14:35:31] <KatrinValerie> Why is it that it's always the math and chemistry students that are rly ffed on drugs? Anyone else ever wonders about that?

[14:36:07] <KatrinValerie> Like sure, people who study these subjects often seem like the serious type on the surface, but oh boy are they different at parties
[14:36:10] <KatrinValerie> some of them
[14:36:22] <KatrinValerie> but pretty much everyone drinks
[14:36:33] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: they work on the edge?
[14:36:39] <DunceCotus> they like to test limits
[14:36:46] <KatrinValerie> Well, math constantly confronts you with your limits
[14:36:52] <DunceCotus> right
[14:36:56] <KatrinValerie> and with some more abstract philsophical issues
[14:37:05] <DunceCotus> its like "if I can do this hard math problem, drugs are a piece of piss"
[14:37:23] <KatrinValerie> for some people mathematical truths can be life shattering, because they make implications about philosophical truths that can be hard to swallow.
[14:37:41] <DunceCotus> or life-shuttering
[14:38:17] <DunceCotus> I think we have to be careful with truths
[14:38:29] <KatrinValerie> Eg, no axiomatic system can be complete and without contradiction at the same time.

[14:40:35] <DunceCotus> milkshake: why would there be?
[14:40:39] <KatrinValerie> milkshake: because you're afraid that the local libraries will be raided when that happens?
[14:40:56] <DunceCotus> local library raiders
[14:41:20] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: a massive solar flare that heavily disrupts and damages the electric grid and it takes over a year to restore things.
[14:41:23] <milkshake> no, local libraries dont store you-know-what-i-mean books
[14:41:39] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: Oh my god that sounds like an indie band name
[14:41:52] <milkshake> DunceCotus: why not?
[14:41:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you know Japan adopted the Chinese calendar before they adopted the Gregorian one. But they kept the names of what they called moon cycles before that. After modernization. Months were replaced with numbers
[14:41:58] <KatrinValerie> milkshake: they often do though?
[14:41:59] <MootPoot> somebody...please

[14:42:36] * MootPoot runs aroudn with his head on fire
[14:42:36] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: not during any time that we had electric grids, to my knowledge
[14:42:42] <milkshake> dont be too positive there'll be always internet connectivity. i experienced that once in 2007, sea cable got pretty damaged badly and no internet for 2 weeks!
[14:42:52] <KatrinValerie> But these super massive flares are rare to begin with
[14:43:03] <DunceCotus> milkshake: that sounds serious
[14:43:12] <DunceCotus> there will at least be local nets I think
[14:43:17] <DunceCotus> if whole grid goes down
[14:43:31] <amigojapan> milkshake: do you live in Tonga?
[14:43:33] <DunceCotus> though we may need some prep-tech
[14:43:35] <milkshake> DunceCotus: yes, luckily i had all those xdcc animes saved in my pc
[14:43:47] <milkshake> amigojapan: no malaysia
[14:43:51] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: you would have to restore those, replace breakers etc

[14:45:03] <KatrinValerie> fringe groups will use the chaos to gain influence
[14:45:08] <DunceCotus> there is some historical evidence of solar or rather celestial plasmic events though

[15:25:30] <MootPoot> lags out occasionally on the server side
[15:26:43] <MootPoot> the main reason all the companies are large orgs use teams is its sceduling and integration with other stuff

[17:10:51] <amigojapan> analoq: you don't know. But DunceCotus could be asked "what are you smoking"for most of his ideas
[17:10:55] <DunceCotus> of the pre-renaissance
[17:11:04] <analoq> so 1100? give or take 200years?
[17:11:11] <DunceCotus> 1500
[17:11:24] <analoq> so we have stuff from the romans from year 0, but nothing from the 1500?
[17:11:28] <analoq> doesnt make sense
[17:11:49] <DunceCotus> the Romans and Greeks had their city states at the same time
[17:11:54] <DunceCotus> they were alchemical civilisations
[17:12:01] <DunceCotus> our history has been jumbled
[17:12:09] <DunceCotus> there's no B.C. Greece/Rome
[17:12:44] <DunceCotus> this is why Greek mythology also features dragons/serpents, griffins etc.
[17:12:54] <DunceCotus> they are from the same time period
[17:13:02] <DunceCotus> the alchemical-mechanical era
[17:13:21] *** Quits: Sadale (~Sadale@user/sadale) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:14:02] <DunceCotus> we went from the alchemical which was about over-coding flows to the de-coding of flows in the empiricist-economic model
[17:14:29] <DunceCotus> this has lead to a nature of economy-maximising life forms
[17:14:53] <DunceCotus> survival of the fittest, evolution by natural selection through chemical interactions
[17:15:00] <DunceCotus> from alchemical to chemical
[17:15:13] <ghab13> Korone does oversleep alot
[17:15:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the first alchemists were trying to turn led into gold
[17:15:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they succeeded
[17:16:10] <DunceCotus> however in doing so it turned into a frenzy of chimerical abominations
[17:16:27] *** Joins: Sadale (~Sadale@user/sadale)
[17:16:36] <DunceCotus> this probably leads into myth about dragons or griffins protecting the gold 
[17:17:07] <DunceCotus> alchemists would have had a lot of power in this time
[17:17:48] <amigojapan> Well alchemy did have some success, soccer it turned into chemistry
[17:17:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think the alchemy broke their economy, which lead to a public consciousness of economy
[17:18:06] <DunceCotus> which lead to the need to preserve and maximise economisation
[17:18:26] <darkwitch> back in those days there was actually gold at the end of the rainbow
[17:18:27] <DunceCotus> and to ensure alchemical transformations cannot occur at least not with the same magic
[17:18:54] <DunceCotus> darkwitch: yes! And it was guarded by a leprechaun
[17:19:05] <amigojapan> darkwitch: darn leprechauns
[17:19:13] <DunceCotus> the break with alchemy also displaced the overlapping worlds
[17:19:19] <DunceCotus> so now we don't have nearly as much fae incursions
[17:19:45] <DunceCotus> the fae likely still live by alchemy
[17:19:45] <darkwitch> darn faeries
[17:19:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you do realise there is no end of a rainbow?
[17:20:02] <DunceCotus> but even their society (and thus nature) may be changing
[17:20:10] <amigojapan> It moves as you move
[17:20:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there was at that time
[17:20:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the laws of physics we know were not the same then
[17:20:23] <amigojapan> Omg
[17:20:27] <DunceCotus> they didn't even have 'physics'
[17:20:33] <DunceCotus> it was habituation
[17:21:13] <DunceCotus> once again the reality we experience is that of the economo-empiricist 
[17:21:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: like a real dream world
[17:21:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we are still living in the dream world
[17:22:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: their fairy tales and myth were not simply morality tales or metaphor
[17:22:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they were real lived experiences
[17:22:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: why do dreams feel so different from waking state?
[17:23:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: varying levels of engagement?
[17:24:00] <DunceCotus> we don't usually desire hyper-realistic dreams 
[17:24:23] <DunceCotus> but dreams can technically be as real as 'reality', its just they're not connected in the same way
[17:25:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: reality also feels continuous and very long
[17:26:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this is a contemporaneous experience
[17:26:11] <darkwitch> as I was saying the other day, thoughts are real
[17:26:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: technically life never ends
[17:26:44] <DunceCotus> we just have become lost in ideas like 'death' or expenditure
[17:26:57] <DunceCotus> stuck in economic cycles
[17:27:07] <DunceCotus> in an econo-maximising nature
[17:27:20] <DunceCotus> but nature is practically bursting to show us how wrong we can be
[17:28:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I dunno what the next socius is gonna be like but it will be interesting.. where to go from economy?

[19:15:35] <Sadale> At least since 1997 and before British colonization.
[19:16:10] <Sadale> Yeah the British took HK away from China after China getting defeated. :(
[19:16:35] <analoq> could you migrate to UK? iirc. they offered some program, but im not sure who is actually eligable for it

[19:17:06] <analoq> good question :D before brexit it was certainly a good place. now, i dont know
[19:17:08] <Sadale> It's expensive af there. And Brexit made it worse. I couldn't even get EU citizenship after moving there.
[19:17:29] <Sadale> And I'd become a kind of second class citizen there for being people of color. :/
[19:17:38] <analoq> eh london is expensive, but it's not all like that

[20:15:05] <Sadale> Terminus, As of today normal people would get the one in range of 3M-10M HKD
[20:15:10] <Sadale> AFAIK.
[20:15:38] <Sadale> Even at 3M HKD it'd take a large part of life of someone to purchase that. Totally not worth it IMHO :/
[20:15:52] <Terminus> an aunt of mine got lucky. she sold her HK apartment around 2018 and bought a couple of units here.

[20:55:26] <Bco1981> we did some tests of that at my previous work. because they wanted to move in to the private sector.
[20:55:31] <Bco1981> omg it is shit
[20:55:40] <Sadale> Time to sleep :3
[20:55:44] <Terminus> PON is how fiber has rolled out so quickly here. 2015, you gotta live in a place with 25M USD houses. today, practically everywhere has fiber access.
[20:56:21] <Sadale> lol that's cheating! :P
[20:56:26] <Sadale> fiber splitter ;P
[20:56:56] <Bco1981> if one connection on the pon was running full speed traffic. then it wouldn't let go of the reserved bandwidht for that user.
[20:56:57] <Urchin[emacs]> hi
[20:56:59] <Terminus> i've got 4x fiber wired up outside my house. 2 for one telco, 2 for 2 more telcos. i can go triple redundant if i want to.
[20:57:20] <Bco1981> and it's a dumb device so you can't see it as a support technician
[20:57:43] <Terminus> Bco1981: just have more bandwidth than you need. the surplus bandwidth over here means there's no problem maintaining the 300 mbps.
[20:58:01] <Terminus> also, our telco has started offering 10 GbE service.
[20:58:08] <Sadale> I'd be happy with 100mbps :3
[20:58:16] <Sadale> Currently mine's 100/10 mbps.
[20:58:24] <Sadale> 100 up 10 down. 
[20:58:26] <Terminus> but i'm not paying for 10 gbps. i can barely use 300 mbps.
[20:58:38] <Bco1981> the problem was it could max do 1.6gbit, so if one use loaded it with 1gbit constant for a while it would not let go and "free up" the reserved bandwidth for the other users.
[20:58:46] <Bco1981> and you can't see that anywere
[20:59:08] <Bco1981> so you will have customer complaining about bandwidth, and you can't see anything wrong
[20:59:09] <Terminus> not sure how the telco handles it here but they probably reduce the split.
[20:59:40] <Bco1981> they probably ignore it, or am fast to just go reset it.
[20:59:45] <Terminus> in any case, i think most people are like me and can't hog gigabit.
[21:00:00] <Bco1981> and shit on customers for being disconnected for a short while
[21:00:37] <Terminus> there's less incentive to hog shared bandwidth when everybody has a surplus and can download everything quickly.
[21:00:37] <Sadale> I wonder if it'd be any profitable to sublet your fiber connection via wifi :P

[21:01:47] <Terminus> Sadale: some people actually do that here but if you can afford $30/mo, why not just get your own line?
[21:02:06] <Sadale> Terminus, to troll the telecom company? :P
[21:02:16] <Sadale> And to save cost of course! xD
[21:02:33] <Bco1981> well to be fair it was a nokia model we tested. and engineering(i was in that team) we said to the higher ups, we can't support this. we can't troubleshoot on this... the answer... but we already bought this...
[21:02:37] <Terminus> meh, i think you're just hurting yourself in the long run because the telco will have less incentive to provide good service with reduced revenue.
[21:02:45] <Sadale> $30/mo adds up. It means $360/year.
[21:02:58] <Sadale> only if everyone's doing that :P
[21:03:19] <Sadale> For $360 I could get a lower mid end phone.
[21:03:24] <Terminus> Sadale: if you can do it with ethernet cable, fine. if you can't do it, then the equipment becomes more trouble than it's worth.
[21:03:35] <Sadale> true
[21:03:51] <Terminus> also, you'll be in trouble if the telco catches you since it's against the contract.
[21:04:02] <Sadale> That's true as well.
[21:04:02] <Terminus> just pay the $30. it's a race to the bottom as it is.

[23:51:25] <redempt1on> Bose sells a really nice pair of wireless overears for about 200-230 CAD
[23:51:36] <Bco1981> ordered the WH-1000XM4
[23:51:38] <redempt1on> Headphones aren't something you wanna cheap out on IMO cause you will always want better
[23:51:43] <redempt1on> Yeah
[23:51:52] <redempt1on> shoulda went with senns, audio technica or bose IMO
[23:52:00] <redempt1on> does audio technica even make wireless shit?
[23:52:03] <redempt1on> wireless headphones?

[23:52:23] <Bco1981> it's not the wireless part i want, just extremly effective ANC
[23:52:33] <redempt1on> ahh
[23:52:35] <Bco1981> i could go wired if needed.
[23:52:38] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[23:52:39] <Bco1981> i just need the ANC
[23:52:40] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell tsunderenoises https://i.imgur.com/oCNJZLK.jpg yuri bondage, slightly nsfw-ish
[23:52:50] <redempt1on> then you probably coulda get something cheaper
[23:52:53] <redempt1on> let me look those up
[23:53:20] <redempt1on> Damn big spender
[23:53:27] <redempt1on> so you weren't after actual quality sounding headphones?
[23:53:28] <redempt1on> just ANC?
[23:53:37] <redempt1on> then shoulda went with Skullcunday Crusher ANC IMO
[23:53:41] <redempt1on> or even Hesh ANC
[23:53:45] <redempt1on> *Candy lol
[23:54:05] <Bco1981> sure they have to sound good, but the anc was most important to me because i have noise i need to filter out.
[23:54:21] <redempt1on> Ahh, heh
[23:57:48] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell KatrinValerie https://i.redd.it/xl8fe74x14f81.jpg
