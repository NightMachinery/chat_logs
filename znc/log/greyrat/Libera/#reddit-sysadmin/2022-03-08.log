[10:46:31] <DrZak> but i am not incompetent, so my mailbox has 400mb and is neatly organized

[10:50:59] <DrZak> so you are saying - they type from: bla and it somehow doesnt find all the mails from bla?
[10:51:06] <SirSceptalot> this user is looking for "from:mail@domain.tld" and it getting certain results, including the ones with the desired subject
[10:51:48] <SirSceptalot> they then narrow the search to from:"mail@domain.tld" subject:"subject"

[12:07:33] <fruity_tomato> what's up peeps, got a question about how to setup networking. I'll be spinning up a vm cluster in Hetzner with Terraform. This cluster will be establishing ipsec VPN to the DC. Question is how to provide the DC resources to be available to the whole cluster and not only to the VM that has the connection?
[12:07:50] <fruity_tomato> I was thinking of dynamically spinning up pfsense but it seems overkill for a tiny vm cluster
[12:09:48] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> they did it in 2019
[12:09:51] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> worked too

[12:10:31] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> basicaly its the same think uk dose. block all ingress/egress ports except those are whitelisted for govenment use
[12:10:34] <Hunterkll> fruity_tomato: I run a vyOS router image on my vmware boxes in OVH to site-site back to my house 
[12:11:59] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> use dmvpn preferably with cisco or not vyos dose it great
[12:12:22] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> thatway your vpn is dynamic however you do need a vyos vm at each site
[12:12:22] <Hunterkll> ooor just stick with the ipsec since it's probably what's compatible with your edge network on-prem
[12:12:37] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> dmvpn is ipsec with mgre
[12:12:50] <fruity_tomato> yeah, i will have to stick with ipsec. Could I just add some routes to the vms in the network to use the vm with ipsec as a gateway?
[12:13:06] * fruity_tomato and networking are a bit foreign
[12:13:17] <Hunterkll> yea, so for mine
[12:13:23] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> depends on the routing protocol your useing

[12:13:48] <fruity_tomato> hetzner cloud has possibility of having it's own LAN network and you can put the VMs inside that
[12:13:49] <Hunterkll> there's two /24's in the OVH network
[12:14:06] <Hunterkll> for externally accessible VMs, I have the vyos router doing 1:1 NAT of IPs assigned to me by OVH
[12:14:12] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> how many site you doing?
[12:14:47] <fruity_tomato> it's only 1 site that will be spun up and it will connect back to the DC to access some resources
[12:14:55] <fruity_tomato> tiny site
[12:15:03] <Hunterkll> yea so no biggy
[12:15:17] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> yeah jsut use ipsec and default route
[12:15:23] <Hunterkll> set up ipsec tunnel, have route on prem to x.x.x.x/24 remote, remote has (whatever your internal IP range is route) back
[12:15:49] <Hunterkll> that way, VMs go straight to the internet and not over ipsec tunnel to grab shit like updates and whatnot

[12:16:11] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> if so your gonna have to run gre inside ipsec

[12:16:15] <fruity_tomato> what's lan extension vpn?
[12:16:16] <Hunterkll> and any additional IP space you purchase from hetzner can be 1:1 nat'd on the VyOS instance

[12:17:34] <fruity_tomato> so if I understood Hunterkll, add routes to access the DC LAN network, to the cloud VMS, and the ipsec client vm will act as gateway?
[12:17:36] <Hunterkll> there we go
[12:17:42] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> essentially gre(generic routing encapsulation) that supports bcast+multicast but dosnt have encryption
[12:17:45] <Hunterkll> hm? Yes
[12:17:48] <Hunterkll> so 
[12:17:54] <Hunterkll> fruity_tomato: you'll set up two vSwitches 
[12:18:00] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> or your network hardware
[12:18:05] <Hunterkll> one leg of the vyOS router in the external one, then one for your VMs themselves
[12:18:08] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> cause a lot of that supports ipsec tunnels
[12:18:58] <Hunterkll> so then, you ipsec site-site the vyos to your on-prem network 
[12:19:24] <Hunterkll> so all the VMs that are on the internal "private" vswitch, will become part of your LAN
[12:19:27] <fruity_tomato> ohh, that makes more sense ye, but arent vSwitches meant for dedicated servers?
[12:19:40] <Hunterkll> hm?
[12:19:46] <Hunterkll> vswitch is just a virtual network switch inside the hypervisor
[12:20:01] <fruity_tomato> https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch/
[12:20:04] <Hunterkll> you can have as many as you want
[12:20:10] <fruity_tomato> ohh okay, so that's not Hetzner specific
[12:20:16] <Hunterkll> I mean vSwitch as in the terminology VMware uses 
[12:20:37] <Hunterkll> that vSwitch that hetzner has, on the surface, lookks like OVH's vRack
[12:20:40] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> it just means virtual switch
[12:20:41] <fruity_tomato> sadly not using hypervisor in the cloud
[12:20:47] <Hunterkll> oh
[12:20:49] <fruity_tomato> it's all just VPSes
[12:20:51] <Hunterkll> well this just got more complex

[12:24:04] <Hunterkll> never been a fan of hetzner myself anyway.... lol
[12:25:28] <fruity_tomato> so question is, if cloud cluster is in lan network, one vm has ipsec tunnel setup, can i just add routes to other vms to use ipsec VM as the GW for the specific network?

[13:00:33] <Hunterkll> nor does it really work like a onedrive/etc client should
[13:00:42] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> tbh its for containers
[13:00:52] <sd_> 09<H​aise> I guess that is true Hunterkll
[13:00:56] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> meh they can use github
[13:01:12] <Hunterkll> hm, the one i linked looks bloody useful
[13:01:22] <Hunterkll> someone made a management GUI and systray applet for it for linux
[13:01:33] <Hunterkll> https://github.com/DanielBorgesOliveira/onedrive_tray
[13:01:56] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> like i said its for containers so no need for gui
[13:02:02] <Hunterkll> and the GUI, https://github.com/bpozdena/OneDriveGUI
[13:02:16] <Hunterkll> no.... it has a container provided image, but it's just for use as a regular desktop onedrive client....
[13:02:47] <Hunterkll> This powerful and highly configurable client can run on all major Linux distributions, FreeBSD, or as a Docker container. It supports one-way and two-way sync capabilities and securely connects to Microsoft OneDrive services.
[13:02:50] <Hunterkll> "or as a"
[13:02:55] <Hunterkll> not "this is meant for containers"
[13:02:59] <Hunterkll> it's meant for regular desktop usage, lol
[13:03:55] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> well you try mount cloud storage on linux for a developer enviorment
[13:04:24] <Hunterkll> I mean, that's the only downside, it's a full sync client, doesn't do the windows-style on-demand sync
[13:04:39] <Hunterkll> but otherwise, it's just another folder in your system
[13:04:46] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> sigh yeah that might be worse
[13:04:58] <Hunterkll> all local operations perform at local speed
[13:04:59] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> trying to save space not eat it by giving everyone 30gb
[13:05:08] <Hunterkll> then the sync just the changes
[13:05:29] <Hunterkll> well, this seems to be the best option in town, all the other linux ones that i've found are similar
[13:05:44] <Hunterkll> personally I hate on-demand sync unless it's for my 25TB onedrive account 
[13:05:48] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> they can use github like proper devs
[13:06:05] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> sadly these buggers have unimited onedrive storage
[13:06:16] <Hunterkll> no.... not unlimited....
[13:06:45] <Hunterkll> 5TB by default, you have to put in a ticket to get it raised past that (assuming you have more than 5 E3 licenses), and past 25TB they start making sharepoint shared site collections in 25TB incriments for you
[13:06:46] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:08:49] <Hunterkll> Though
[13:09:02] <Hunterkll> you can configure, via the CLI/GUI, which folders you want to sync @hotmess
[13:09:10] <Hunterkll> so deploy the GUI and tell idiots to not click more than they need

[13:57:01] <Hunterkll> nope, wasn't external routes 
[13:57:10] <kerat58> my best guess, perhaps the 'old IP' was a server that had some sort of forwarding magic
[13:57:16] <teh_f4ll3n> I don't see how that has anything to do with that
[13:57:16] <Hunterkll> misconfiguration *withdrew* external BGP routes for facebook's DNS infrastructure
[13:57:26] <kerat58> when they changed 'the ip', the new server doesn't forward to the real MX
[13:57:27] <kerat58> perhaps
[13:57:27] <Hunterkll> it wasn't advertising, they dropped their own routes

[13:57:37] <teh_f4ll3n> nope
[13:57:42] <Hunterkll> "Security experts identified the problem as a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) withdrawal of the IP address prefixes in which Facebook's Domain Name servers were hosted, making it impossible for users to resolve Facebook and related domain names, and reach services."

[13:58:34] <Hunterkll> no...
[13:58:36] <Hunterkll> "On October 5, Facebook's engineering team posted a blog post explaining the cause of the outage. During maintenance, a command was run to assess the global backbone capacity, and that command accidentally disconnected all of Facebook's data centers. While Facebook's DNS servers ran on a separate network, they were designed to withdraw their BGP routes if they could not connect to Facebook's data centers, making it 
[13:58:36] <Hunterkll> impossible for the rest of the internet to connect to Facebook"

[13:59:14] <Hunterkll> facebook accidentally disconnected their own DCs, and the DNS infra's automated system withdrew routes
[13:59:16] <kerat58> Facebook's BGP announcements have left the chat.
[13:59:17] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> i assume thats their own incident report your reading
[13:59:51] <Hunterkll> After the fact, their route announcements *were the same*
[13:59:53] <Hunterkll> not different
[14:00:00] <Hunterkll> and still remain similar to this day
[14:00:03] <Hunterkll> Cloudflare reported that at 15:39 UTC, Facebook made a significant number of BGP updates, including the withdrawal of routes to the IP prefixes, which included all of their authoritative nameservers. This made Facebook's DNS servers unreachable from the Internet. By 15:50 UTC, Facebook's domains had expired from the caches in all major public resolvers. A little before 21:00 UTC, Facebook resumed announcing BGP 
[14:00:03] <Hunterkll> updates, with Facebook's domain name becoming resolvable again at 21:05 UTC.

[14:22:21] <Hunterkll> that should be the last fix i have to do
[14:22:30] <Hunterkll> let that islicone cure for a moment and shoul dbe good to go
[14:23:25] <teh_f4ll3n> https://pastebin.com/V4sg7jMd this is what their DNS records looked like before and after
[14:24:00] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm guessing the zone update somehow "corrected" the MX records
[14:25:03] <kerat58> ah wait a sec 
[14:25:20] <kerat58> The wildcard always pointed towards $old_ip
[14:25:41] <teh_f4ll3n> because they stopped receiving emails as soon as the zone updated with the new A record
[14:25:42] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[14:25:50] <teh_f4ll3n> like I said - weird
[14:26:06] <kerat58> uhm
[14:26:16] <kerat58> is there an MX answering at $new_ip?
[14:26:22] <kerat58> or something on port 25
[14:26:24] <kerat58> i should say
[14:26:27] <Hunterkll> ^
[14:26:30] <teh_f4ll3n> and the old wildcard IP doesn't have any MX answering anyway
[14:26:38] <Hunterkll> O.o
[14:26:40] <teh_f4ll3n> so it should have not worked originally
[14:26:43] <Hunterkll> so remove the domain.tld record
[14:26:48] <Hunterkll> since it seems they're using g suite
[14:26:51] <teh_f4ll3n> not 5 months later after a zone update
[14:26:59] <teh_f4ll3n> I did and it fixed it
[14:27:04] <kerat58> methinks that if it shouldnt' have worked originally, maybe the next MX (mx priority 1 which is aspmx.l.google) was always being used.
[14:27:19] <teh_f4ll3n> I just couldn't figure out why now and not when it was set up this way
[14:27:24] <kerat58> But then when $new_ip came into play, maybe there's something on port 25, so now all the sudden MX hits that IP
[14:27:46] <teh_f4ll3n> no new ip only changed for the base A record
[14:27:55] <teh_f4ll3n> wilcard was not touched
[14:27:57] <Hunterkll> right
[14:28:00] <kerat58> yes, but the priority 0 MX was for domain.tld
[14:28:03] <Hunterkll> new_ip is what the MX record is pointing to
[14:28:03] <kerat58> which had an explicit A record
[14:28:05] <Hunterkll> not the wildcard
[14:28:21] <teh_f4ll3n> yes, but cloud flare replaces that with _dc-mx
[14:28:41] <teh_f4ll3n> which is covered by the wildcard
[14:28:58] <kerat58> i thought cloudflare couldn't/shouldn't touch mail stuff
[14:29:04] <kerat58> ugh
[14:29:20] <teh_f4ll3n> domain.tld 300     IN      MX      0 _dc-mx.f1521bf436c2.mccauleyproperties.com.

[19:12:00] <mistiry> the first week after we were acquired, we all got invited to the retirement party for the founder of the company that bought us out. we were not even a week into having new owners. nobody knew anyone. and it was VIRTUAL, since we were states away. 
[19:12:20] <mistiry> like an hour or two of people giving speeches about how great he was, etc.
[19:12:22] <thegodsquirrel> That's hella awkward

[19:15:42] <mistiry> his replacement was a board and people installed by the VC firm

[19:25:09] <Oliber> checked the firewall is allowing SSH? does the WinSCP client give you an error message that is more concise than "obvious error"
[19:26:30] <mistiry> It is easy to test if its the cert permissions. Try copying a different file that has 755 or something. 
[19:27:07] <mistiry> Change the target destination to a different location with more lax permissions. etc.
[19:31:06] <sd_> 04<n​odes> I seemed to have found a work around.  Copy the folder with the certs to a different directory, change permissions/owner and then copy to win10 machine.
[19:31:16] <sd_> 04<n​odes> Probably not the best way, but whatever
[19:33:25] <mistiry> not only is it not the best way, it's a _bad_ way

[23:05:34] <DrGibby> wait, yeah, people use the UI on cloud platforms? 
[23:05:39] <CSWS> at least the web UI has a dark mode I guess
[23:05:43] <CSWS> one up on AWS there

[23:05:55] <rpifan> well what other options are tehr
[23:05:56] <shakygator> lots of people use UIs cuz they think they can click and something gets built "im done here"
[23:05:57] <Hunterkll> is discord still fukt
[23:05:59] <shakygator> yes
[23:06:06] <mistiry> just use ansible or DSC to configure the default offerings or whatever
[23:06:08] <shakygator> i like UIs for poking around, or quick fixes
[23:06:19] <mistiry> and yes dark mode++
[23:06:27] <shakygator> sometimes i dont wanna write a script to change a tag value (although now those values are managed via IaC so no changing)

[23:20:07] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> also, opinion question then Hunterkll.  10 Hosts, not much beyond normal VM's/LUNS/etc: Is SCVMM worth it over straight failover?
[23:20:31] <Hunterkll> Well, unlike ESXi, Failover clustering buys you a lot of the capabilities 
[23:20:37] <Hunterkll> for "free"
[23:20:55] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> oh I know.
[23:21:00] <Hunterkll> SCVMM is worth it, i won't deny that, but it depends on what you want/need to do with it 
[23:21:00] <sd> 07<R​umble Truck™> hey discord is back
[23:21:13] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> My opinion is Failover Cluster works fanatastically for 95% of what we need to do
[23:21:17] <Hunterkll> want VM templates? You need SCVMM 
[23:21:18] <fritzwastaken> <3 me some VMM
[23:21:20] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> and the extra 5% for SCVMM isn't worth it.
[23:21:40] <Hunterkll> it's not a pain to set up, single server, self contained self hosted SQL 
[23:21:49] <Hunterkll> worst case, you get rid of it if it's not useful
[23:22:12] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> eh, we've got it right now
[23:22:16] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> but it's been...neglected
[23:22:28] <Hunterkll> nuke it
[23:22:30] <Hunterkll> rebuild it
[23:22:32] <E-werd> I remember using SCVMM years back for the sake of dynamic balancing.  The overhead just wasn't worth the features though.
[23:22:32] <Hunterkll> blank slate
[23:22:41] <E-werd> templates were nice.
[23:22:43] <JollyRgrs> huh https://twitter.com/internetdsrptns
[23:22:44] <Hunterkll> system center products are a huge "blank slate" type of deal
[23:22:51] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, i think thats my path
[23:22:58] <Hunterkll> it's like ITIL frameworks or whatever
[23:23:01] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> I did alreayd solve the templates problem anyways with Packer
[23:23:03] <Hunterkll> you get out of it what you put in 
[23:24:01] <Hunterkll> so nuke and rebuild
[23:24:09] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yep on the list
[23:24:22] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> right after I clear out the hell that is Server 2008 r2 still in prod
[23:24:22] <Hunterkll> until you're using hardware baselines or SDN type stuff, you won't "see" the value
[23:24:29] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, we're not
[23:24:49] <Hunterkll> if you can get all hosts on the same hardware, then you can light up hardware baselines and autodeploy like VMware
[23:25:03] <Hunterkll> or at least isolated into groups
[23:25:15] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, it is all on the same hardware
[23:25:22] <Hunterkll> Also, SCVMM can manage VMware ;)
[23:25:24] <DrGibby> yay spotify is back!

[23:26:04] <DrGibby> other than some really loud grumblings this morning, I've not had a movement 
[23:26:09] <Hunterkll> @onenerdyguy so if they're all the same, then set up hardware baselines
[23:26:24] <Hunterkll> You can mass change/manage like vmware vDS 
[23:26:45] <Hunterkll> set up fabrics, SDN defined vlans, etc
[23:27:15] <Hunterkll> HW baseline is like an autoconfigure of the host
[23:27:20] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> ah
[23:27:35] <Hunterkll> so if you change a fabric vswitch, the change is on all hosts 
[23:27:48] <Hunterkll> you assign VMs to the fabric switch, not to a host vswitch
[23:28:16] <Hunterkll> for 10 hosts it's iffy, but i use it for ~900 hosts without issue :3
[23:28:23] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, thats what I figured
[23:28:28] <sd> 12<f​elda> DrGibby why did you try to take down Discord?
