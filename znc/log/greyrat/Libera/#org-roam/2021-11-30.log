[16:52:52] <peutri> is there a page somewhere that explains a bit the reasons for the various changes with the migration?  to channel my complaining
[16:53:54] <konubinix> I guess that nobiot might have done something on discourse
[16:54:32] <konubinix> May be this ? https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/the-org-roam-v2-great-migration/1505
[16:54:58] <zaeph> peutri: Go on.
[16:55:22] <zaeph> What's your problem with it?
[16:57:46] <peutri> not a problem, just multiple paper cuts :)
[16:58:09] <zaeph> Yeah, they're to be expected if your mental model was based on files.
[16:58:31] <zaeph> A lot of our communication/documentation towards the start was based on nodes-as-files, so I don't blame you.
[16:58:35] <peutri> which was kind of the point of the system, right? :p
[16:58:43] <zaeph> No.
[16:59:08] <peutri> find-file/node has become harder to use
[16:59:08] <zaeph> The system was always based on “nodes” as an atomic unit; the fact that it got equated to files is not really the point of the system.
[16:59:24] <zaeph> It's harder to use because noone's got around to writing a good UX for it.
[16:59:31] <peutri> I used to have case-insensitive, with completion
[16:59:35] <zaeph> That's most probably my job, and I've been busy elsewhere.
[16:59:59] <zaeph> Rather than listing all your grievances here, I'd really appreciate if you could log them somewhere, potentially on Discourse, given the nature.
[17:00:09] <peutri> hey you asked for it!
[17:00:15] <zaeph> I'd rather work with an itemised list than having to keep it on the mental stack.
[17:00:19] <peutri> but I can certainly do that
[17:00:22] <zaeph> Oh I know I did; sorry if I sounded curt.
[17:00:54] <peutri> konubinix: thanks for the discourse link btw, it appears to be a lot of what i wanted to know
[17:01:09] <zaeph> It's just that I'm knee-deep into EmacsConf processing right now, and I've got to leverage nerd-snipes. :)
[17:01:21] <zaeph> And by “leveraging”, I mostly mean ducking them.
[17:01:30] <peutri> damn I'm late on that too
[17:01:53] <zaeph> Feel free to catch up: https://emacsconf.org/2021/all/
[17:02:00] <peutri> not today :(
[17:02:05] <peutri> adding that to my todo
[17:02:11] <peutri> if org-roam-find-node can find it
