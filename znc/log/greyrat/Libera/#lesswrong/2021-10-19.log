[00:00:25] <Robomot> Vanessa Kosoy comments on My experience at and around MIRI and CFAR (inspired by Zoe Curzi's writeup of experiences at Leverage) - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (I met Vassar once. …)
[00:00:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I also met Vassar once. He came across as a kinda-weird, kinda-awkward nerdy dude
[00:00:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing special or unusual
[00:01:37] <LeoTal> Hm so I'm arguing that 1) their reasoning looks flimsy (really, you can tell kefira from his tone?) 2) but is in fact correct (yes, and you can too, admit it!) 3) but the overall conclusion is still wrong because of a different premise. What level of judo am I on?
[00:02:32] <LeoTal> Obormot strikes me as the kind of person likely to be immune to charismatic auras
[00:04:00] <ggreer> https://www.cyclotech.at/ how is this better than normal fans?
[00:04:02] <Robomot> CycloTech - CycloTech
[00:04:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: You, too, can be immune to charismatic auras. Just don't trust anyone and be automatically suspicious of anything
[00:05:40] <ggreer> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz7SQ1nb4HQ&t=43s I'm guessing it's noisy as hell compared to equivalent lift from ducted fans
[00:05:41] <Robomot> CycloTech First Flight - YouTube (Check out the first flight of the CycloTech technology demonstrator. The Austrian company based its "CycloRotor" propulsion system on the Voith Schneider Pro...)
[00:06:58] <ggreer> it looks like the blades have to change the angle of attack as the drum rotates. seems very fail deadly
[00:07:02] <gwern> ggreer: is this that weird rotating tube helicopter design we were discussing a while ago?
[00:07:21] <ggreer> we discussed it? uh oh I guess my mind is going (or I got on IRC while drunk)
[00:07:34] <ggreer> it's not in my browser history
[00:07:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the drugs
[00:08:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Gonna explain any and all mental problems experienced by anyone associated with rationalists by drugs, from now on)
[00:08:34] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclorotor
[00:08:35] <Robomot> Cyclorotor - Wikipedia (A cyclorotor, cycloidal rotor, cycloidal propeller or cyclogiro, is a fluid propulsion device that converts shaft power into the acceleration of a fluid using a rotating axis perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. It uses several blades with a spanwise axis parallel to the axis of rotation and perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. …)
[00:08:48] <ggreer> I definitely remember discussing other stupid designs, but not this particular one
[00:10:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> fwiw I also don't remember any prior discussion of this
[00:10:25] <ggreer> I tend to trust gwern's memory more than my own. he definitely recalls more details more often. nobody's perfect though
[00:10:39] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: I do not expect good outcomes from 1) being desperately lonely (and scared of admitting it) 2) never seeing what trustworthy people are like from known examples 3) screaming at the top of your lungs that you're an easy mark for anyone who acts like you're a fellow sceptical soul who has pierced the veil unlike those sheep
[00:12:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Well... I don't have any of those problems, though
[00:13:41] <LeoTal> I doubt that you're as untrusting as you say you are; and even if you are, then it's downstream of the immunity, not upstream
[00:13:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah that's totally true
[00:14:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was being kinda facetious, sorry
[00:14:55] <LeoTal> Jokes were made to be taken literally
[00:15:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I had one conversation with Soryu [the head of Monastic Academy / MAPLE] at a small party once. I mentioned that my feeling about meditation is that it’s really good for everyone when done for 15 minutes a day, and when done for much more than that forever, it’s much more complicated and sometimes harmful.
[00:15:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> He straightforwardly agreed, and said he provides the environment for long term dedication to meditation because there is a market demand for that product."
[00:15:58] * gwern keeps hoping for an evangelion twist there
[00:16:13] <galambo> I think sleeping those extra 15 minutes might be more beneficial
[00:16:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> (So here we have the head of MAPLE basically taking the position of a tobacco company executive)
[00:16:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Like, "if people want to fuck themselves up on this shit, hey, who am I to stop 'em")
[00:18:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Really just incredible how prevalent, among "rationalists", is this attitude of "but actually this is possibly beneficial, let's all try doing it a lot!", toward things (psychedelics, extreme meditation, etc.) that, upon inspection, turn out to just be straightforwardly bad
[00:18:18] <bildramer> reading LW drama makes me want to start an actual cult where this bullshit wouldn't fly
[00:18:22] <LeoTal> Okay so I've read the two posts and I'm extremely confused. 1) Is Leverage/Geoff Anders related to miricfarvassardowsky, or is Jessica just saying "Zoe complained about an org, I will also complain about a different org" 2) What the hell is Jessica talking about, like, at all? I understand it involved two suicides and a psychotic break so that seems bad, but I don't understand any of the bits in the middle with the head-downvotes and 
[00:18:22] <LeoTal> the debugging and the leaders. Adding the information that drugs were involved fails to clarify
[00:18:44] <galambo> I think you guys are taking this rationalist stuff way too seriously
[00:18:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> This entire community of people who were supposed to be the best at truth-seeking and rationality, largely destroyed itself by doing manifestly self-destructive things
[00:19:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amazing. Really, just jaw-dropping
[00:19:10] <ggreer> I'm confused about this stuff too. jessica seemed pretty chill and normal to me, but I think that was in 2016
[00:19:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Right, and *then* she did a bunch of psychedelics
[00:19:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's literally the timeline here
[00:19:45] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: Ehhh there's kind of a harm-reduction argument, like "the market will provide monasteries to meet demand, I endeavour to provide one that's less harmful than what my customers would do otherwise"
[00:19:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, sure
[00:20:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> "People will take meth anyway, best they take *my* meth, which is pure"
[00:20:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Literally Heisenberg up in here
[00:20:28] <galambo> how is this different from jordan peterson getting addicted to benzos?
[00:21:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Anyway you've pretty much got the gist of it, re: the posts. It's the second thing
[00:21:26] <ggreer> https://shop.tesla.com/ko_kr/product/ccs-combo-1-adapter---south-korea looks like teslas are getting a CCS adapter. this means they'll be able to use electrify america and other fast charging stations
[00:21:26] <Robomot> CCS 콤보 1 어댑터 (상세설명:타사 충전 네트워크와 호환되는 Tesla CCS 콤보 1 어댑터로 한층 다양해진 급속충전 옵션을 경험해보시기 바랍니다. CCS1 차징 스테이션에서 CCS 콤보 1 어댑터를 사용하기 전에 호환성을 포함한 자세한 내용은 지원페이지를 참고해주시기 바랍니다. …)
[00:21:30] <LeoTal> As far as I know, the term "harm reduction" comes from drugs, which strongly suggests that I will reply to "har har, do you say that about meth too" with "Yes.png"
[00:21:52] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: I don't remember exactly when I last talked to her. I think it was 2016 but it might have been later
[00:22:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: It doesn't stop being dumb, for all that
[00:22:17] <bildramer> I don't get how so many people talk about vassar like "he basically told me to kill myself, but otherwise he's a swell guy"
[00:22:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, I don't actually think he told anyone to kill themselves
[00:22:48] <bildramer> probably not
[00:23:09] <ggreer> vassar always seemed weird, but at some point he went insane and became a white supremacist and I think moved to montana
[00:23:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> errr
[00:23:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> You sure you're not thinking of the *other* Michael?
[00:23:54] <ggreer> which other michael vassar?
[00:24:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, lol
[00:24:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Michael Anissimov
[00:24:09] <ggreer> ohh. whoops yeah him
[00:24:42] <gwern> I could believe anissimov telling people to kill themselves. that's probably part of why moreright fell apart, twitter keeps banning him, and he's done nothing of note in like a decade
[00:25:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah that dude went super weird
[00:25:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dunno what was up with him
[00:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But you know what, I'm gonna say it was drugs too)
[00:25:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I have no specific cause for thinking that but I dare you to bet against me)
[00:27:47] <gwern> from what I recall, anissimov has always been that way even as a teen
[00:28:03] <gwern> so it's not like 'well (s)he was cool in 2016, not sure what happened'
[00:28:59] <gwern> that said, the amount of psycehdelics use in these anecdotes definitely has me wondering if maybe the whole human potential/california memeplex is not as bad as I thought - like colin powell and corona, it's just a secondary opporunitistic infection
[00:29:06] <LeoTal> I remember calling Anissimov a faggot on twitter
[00:29:16] <ggreer> LeoTal: as one does
[00:29:20] <rmmh> oops! all schizophrenia
[00:30:37] <gwern> LeoTal: is he?
[00:30:40] <LeoTal> ggreer: The reason is that he'd said he'd kill anyone who called him a faggot (or words along those vague lines, that was like 10 years ago), so I went into "ve do not nekotiate viz terrorists" mode, but that's not funny if you explain it
[00:30:41] <ggreer> I do wonder what the multiplier is. take any neighborhood of 1,000 people and you're going to have what... at least 80 felons?
[00:30:54] <LeoTal> gwern: Would bet against

[00:31:44] <ggreer> there's definitely more weird behavior in certain groups, but I think a lot of it is that they're subjected to greater scrutiny and publicity
[00:32:19] <ggreer> eg: when I moved in, my next door neighbor had a woman pounding on his door screaming, "you've been cheating on me this entire relationship!"

[00:33:08] <ggreer> I'm sure if you scrutinized the lives of everyone in this complex, you'd get some news stories

[00:38:40] <kuudes> ok, yeah
[00:38:45] <rmmh> right, rowhouse in europe
[00:40:17] <cpopell> I need to get rich so I can get a giant stonecutting CNC

[00:40:50] <kuudes> nice housing ggreer btw :)
[00:41:10] <ggreer> kuudes: thanks. I really like the view from my new place

[00:41:37] <kuudes> sounds good! :)
[00:41:55] <kuudes> it has no yard so you don't need to mow the lawn, I suppose?
[00:45:47] <kuudes> I got fiber to my new home today! :D
[00:46:07] <galambo> kuudes, congrats
[00:46:12] <galambo> how fast
[00:46:31] <kuudes> 1000Mbps/100Mbps, same as now :-/
[00:46:45] <kuudes> they make sounds they might start to offer 10 Gbps in future
[00:46:48] <galambo> wow thats mega fast
[00:48:49] <kuudes> I had in the past 1000/1000 but they have cut upstream :-(
[00:49:22] <adiabatty> do you use upstream for anything
[00:49:38] <adiabatty> most I use it for is cloud backup
[00:50:49] <adiabatty> >download file >move it out of ~/Downloads >upload file
[00:53:33] <kuudes> for work
[00:53:48] <kuudes> you know, web development needs to transfer gigabytes of dockers up and down :-p

[00:54:17] <adiabatty> oh, we haven't done much Docker yet
[00:54:39] <adiabatty> so far I've only used it to keep Java-based databases at arm's length

[00:55:56] <kuudes> "shops, restaurants, schools and entertainment will be closed, with only essential services available and a curfew in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. Only essential manufacturing, construction and critical jobs will be allowed to continue in person."
[00:57:34] <gwern> rough, but I expect good complaince - they know to trust dr doom in difficult technical matters like these
[00:57:37] <kuudes> wow, they have currently infection pace which goes through 100% of population within 11 days
[00:57:47] <LeoTal> Curfews feel like they shouldn't work (forcing people outside at the same time!) but they do
[00:57:49] <kuudes> 864/10000 per day
[00:58:21] <kuudes> so 120960 per 100k over 14 days I suppose
[00:58:35] <kuudes> so, 1.2 population per capita over 2 weeks

[01:19:07] <kuudes> can you rephrase?
[01:21:13] <LeoTal> Among people who are trying to solve global warming (by reducing it or mitigating its consequence), last time I checked, the main plan was to make the sun heat the planet less (by putting dark or reflective stuff in the atmosphere). Is that still the case?

[01:40:04] <galambo> kuudes, how is that different from stress testing an overclocked cpu to make sure it doesnt have errors?
[01:40:21] <kuudes> I think you refer to rmmh
[01:40:29] <galambo> ah yes
[01:40:32] <Urchin[emacs]> kuudes: not original to me
[01:40:43] <kuudes> :)
[01:41:21] <rmmh> galambo: overclocked CPUs exceed their manufactured design tolerances and crash rather spectactularly
[01:42:01] <rmmh> there's a bunch of more subtle errors that occur with noticeable frequency given a few hundred thousand cpus
[01:42:35] <galambo> rmmh, yes they crash rather spectacularly which is why you run stress tests for hours to make sure they arent making any errors or overheating
[01:42:51] <rmmh> the stress tests overclockers run are rather primitive
[01:42:54] <kuudes> it would be fun if one of the billionaires would actually convert their net worth into coins and make a money bin for them
[01:42:56] <rmmh> usually just FPU stuff
[01:43:49] <galambo> rmmh, I agree overclocking is not worth it nowadays. but back in the glory days when you could get 50-100% overclocks on the cheapest hardware in the market and stock coolers
[01:43:52] <galambo> it was worth it :D
[01:43:57] <rmmh> yes

[01:47:53] <galambo> LeoTal, but elon musk is swimming in money all day long and keeps posting those stupid tweets
[01:48:17] <rmmh> LeoTal: I think if you made a bunch of gold ball bearings you would have decent buoyancy
[01:50:03] <ggreer> depends on how much you overclock them. yields on modern CPUs are good enough that almost all of them can perform at the speed of the highest binned processors
[01:50:24] <rmmh> ggreer: they're generally thermally limited more than anything
[01:51:02] <galambo> ggreer, back in the day you could buy literally the cheapest cpu and the cheapest motherboard in the market and get a 50-100% overclock
[01:51:07] <galambo> I did it twice
[01:51:11] <ggreer> yes, so did I
[01:51:21] <galambo> once with the c2d e4300 from 1.8 to 3ghz
[01:51:22] <ivan> when you 'stress test' an overclocked CPU, you are running a very primitive QA process compared to the manufacturer's binning process
[01:51:30] <galambo> and the e2500 from 2.5 to 4ghz
[01:52:15] <galambo> you cannot do that with a modern system. with a modern system you are better off with the highest end cpu you can afford and then put it in the cheapest motherboard you can find
[01:52:28] <galambo> and forget about overclocking

[02:08:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "EDIT/UPDATE: I got a chance to talk to Vassar, who disagrees with my assessment above. We’re still trying to figure out the details, but so far, we agree that there was a cluster of related psychoses around 2017, all of which were in the same broad part of the rationalist social graph. Features of that part were—it contained a lot of trans women, a lot of math-y people, and some people who had been influenced by Vassar,
[02:08:16] <Obormot\Arcturus>  although Vassar himself may not have been a central member. We are still trying to trace the exact chain of who had problems first and how those problems spread. One central node was a person called Olivia who apparently claimed she was deliberately trying to cause breakdowns in other people she was close to. Other people don’t seem to have been directly linked to Olivia, so something else must have been going on. I still
[02:08:16] <Obormot\Arcturus>  suspect that Vassar unwittingly came up with some ideas that other people, including Olivia and Ziz, then spread. Vassar still denies this and is going to try to explain a more complete story to me when I have more time."
[02:08:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> If only we had somehow prevented olivia from going to the Bay Area
[02:08:55] <kuudes> ggreer, I got moderna as my third dose
[02:09:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then none of this would have happened maybe!
[02:09:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if... we, of #lesswrong, are the real monsters
[02:09:26] <kuudes> are we the baddies
[02:09:37] * kuudes checks if his hat has a skull
[02:09:50] <LeoTal> Olivia is the person who was a regular here, right? If so, yeah, that's heartbreaking (even if you say so while being a dickish clown)
[02:11:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes she was a regular here
[02:12:07] <galambo> what was her handle? can someone pm me?
[02:12:12] <LeoTal> I don't think "don't go west" would have been the right advice. The silicon sirens have quite a pull, mostly for good reason. I'm not sure what advice we could have given
[02:12:23] <LeoTal> IIRC it was just "olivia"
[02:12:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: Her handle, shockingly enough, was ... olivia
[02:12:36] <kuudes> she used drugs, didn't she?
[02:12:38] <ggreer> was her last name schaefer?
[02:12:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: yes
[02:12:48] <galambo> I remember some people here talking about taking drugs/psychadelics and I was freaking out
[02:14:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: afaik the use of psychedelics started after the West Coast migration (due to access), but prior to that she used dissociatives like DXM
[02:14:05] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: all that is necessary for (machine) elves to triumph is for good men to do nothing
[02:14:12] <LeoTal> At the time we were in touch, her health was rather poor, so I would have recommended against psychedelics if asked
[02:14:28] <kuudes> wait, was bright related to this clique of death?
[02:14:33] *** Joins: Jayson_Virissimo (~Jayson_Vi@ip98-165-142-10.ph.ph.cox.net)
[02:14:34] <kuudes> :-(
[02:14:40] <LeoTal> (Or, really, told that she was planning to take meds for non-health reasons)
[02:14:40] <galambo> and then the conversation would devolve into me saying that I would never touch any substance that makes me stupid including alcohol. and then you guys telling me I am too square.
[02:15:02] <gwern> I didn't think bright was connected. I was pretty sure he wasn't in the bay area but somewhere far away
[02:15:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I don't think so
[02:15:16] <kuudes> was? is she (olivia) in past tense?
[02:15:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> nnno?
[02:15:26] <kuudes> ok, thanks Obormot\Arcturus
[02:15:37] <kuudes> ah, it was referring to her on the channel here, ok
[02:15:39] <gwern> afaik olivia is alive. just in bad dudgeon with everyone so that's why we don't hear much?
[02:15:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> My sources say that olivia is doing better now
[02:16:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> For some value of "better", I guess
[02:16:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe just less drug use
[02:16:06] <kuudes> bad dungeon?
[02:16:30] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: possibly damning with faint praise if the baseline is 'going around boasting about trying to induce psychotic episodes & taking credit for suicides'
[02:16:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[02:16:57] <Betawolf> kuudes: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dudgeon
[02:16:57] <kuudes> I feel something somewhere has went wrong as we seem to have a case of "why have all these people died related to lesswrong?" at our hands
[02:16:58] <Robomot> dudgeon - Wiktionary
[02:17:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Certainly let's not go overboard with the sympathy given that she seems to have been actively contributing to all this crazy shit
[02:17:27] <kuudes> Betawolf, huh, thanks
[02:17:40] <gwern> kuudes: yeah, but on the bright side, even though LW hasn't grown much (has it?) this all seems fairly recent. like, no one was trying to tally suicide clusters in like 2011
[02:17:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I was being facetious about that; I don't actually think we have any moral responsibility here
[02:18:21] <gwern> I don't think we got the first known LWer suicide until maybe 2013? and that was a very obscure one unconnected to miri or anything
[02:18:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like imagine if namespace goes crazy one day and becomes a terrorist or, god forbid, a congressman
[02:18:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Would that be on our consciences? No
[02:18:42] <galambo> is that grognor?
[02:18:49] <gwern> no, grognor was much later
[02:18:49] <kuudes> there were some random cases of someone coming to the channel and talking being actively suicidical iirc
[02:18:52] <LeoTal> Okay, but other than "I have a terminal case of irony poisoning and I must be cynical at all times", why *don't* you think so?
[02:19:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern refers to pdf-something, I think
[02:19:15] <LeoTal> 2011
[02:19:15] <gwern> yeah... that sounds vaguely familiar
[02:19:37] <LeoTal> pdf23s, 2011-03-16
[02:19:40] <kuudes> #lesswrong selected for low agreeableness iirc. was it also high neuroticism?
[02:20:05] <gwern> ah. I was off a bit in years... regardless, no one responded to pdf23s by pointing out other suicides and psychoses
[02:20:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: I'm not cynical at all times, what are you talking about? Have you ever seen me talk about bagels, for example
[02:20:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I would say we're probably the least-neurotic rationalist online space
[02:20:50] <gwern> the way I read it, this is pretty much a 100% product of a small set of toxic groups in the bay area recruiting the most mentally ill locals they could like trans who are comorbid for like everything under the sun, and then dabbling in all the random human potential techniques and drugs they could
[02:20:59] <gwern> like, where are the NYC suicide clusters?
[02:21:16] <galambo> maybe we should detach ourselves from the website? lets call channel something else
[02:21:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, I haven't heard of anyone suiciding in NYC rationalist groups
[02:21:18] * gwern also remarks suspiciously on how this seems to postdate MoR
[02:22:12] <kuudes> yeah, MoR seems to select for different set of people than lesswrong?
[02:22:18] <gwern> you know, the goenka people make you sign paperwork that you have no psychiatric diagnoses or medication. too bad we can't do that for LW and all related groups
[02:22:27] <kuudes> goenka?
[02:22:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: If we did that then LW would just evaporate immediately
[02:22:37] <gwern> kuudes: vipassana meditation. very common because it's free
[02:22:43] <LeoTal> I remember after pdf23ds's death, I took serious inventory of what I could have done to prevent it, and decided to be more proactive in reaching out to people who were doing mentally poorly, but didn't find fault. In hindsight, I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with LW: LW attracted mentally suffering people but didn't worsen the suffering (and did provide community that could alleviate it, and also cool shit to hope to do after re
[02:22:43] <LeoTal> covery)
[02:22:50] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: we can have an exclusion for autism spectrum disorder diagnoses and ADHD
[02:22:52] <kuudes> oh. yeah, I have understood it causes suicides
[02:23:06] <kuudes> well depression, gwern
[02:23:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ok, but what about depression? And that's comorbid with ASDs...
[02:23:35] <gwern> we should definitely exclude the depressed. what if they get even more depressed talking about ai risk or scrupulosity?
[02:23:40] <gwern> lots of suicides there
[02:24:11] <kuudes> simple. ban anyone when they suicide!

[02:49:00] <namespace> saturn2: Chanserv still won't give me op lol
[02:49:01] <kuudes> alcohol is nice but it is a solvent and a bad thing to get good vibes out of
[02:49:42] <kuudes> namespace, you are not in chanserv ops
[02:49:44] <galambo> I think the point of the lw community is high functioning autistic people who can ignore social cues and recognise elephants in the room. and then use the elephant to break the game and win it. like one would in hearthstone or slay the spire.
[02:50:12] <kuudes> that is a thing
[02:50:28] <galambo> taking psychadelics is exactly the opposite of what a lw person would do
[02:50:33] <galambo> like literally the opposite
[02:51:09] <kuudes> antipsychotics?
[02:52:08] <kuudes> I model dopamine being maybe a constant bias for neurons. so if you increase dopamine levels, you get random neurons to fire, if you reduce it, you get random neurons to stop firing
[02:52:42] <kuudes> but neither is the correct solution for best working, you need the bias to be in middle and correct level in correct places
[02:52:50] <galambo> the whole point of the sequences is to tell you that truth is what is real and not what other people think
[02:53:59] <galambo> how exactly are psychadelics going to help with this?
[02:56:13] <kuudes> I think but I am not sure that currently only gwern and mst can edit chanserv flags for #lesswrong
[02:56:19] <gwern> LeoTal: I could probably make BBQ myself and then kiss my cat for a lot less than $100/bottle, yeah
[02:56:22] <kuudes> galambo, indeed
[02:56:38] <kuudes> ... do cats taste like mermaids?
[02:56:49] <LeoTal> I think it's a "pussy" pun
[02:56:59] <gwern> kuudes: I feed him mostly salmon and other seafood 'pates', so I assume so
[02:57:10] <gwern> what else do you think mermaid eat with those sharp needle teeth
[02:57:18] <kuudes> bbq
[02:57:22] <cpopell> In theory the point of psychedelics is one of a couple:
[02:57:22] <cpopell> * Realize things about yourself
[02:57:22] <cpopell> * Get rid of ingrained patterns that are harming you in terms of recognizing things in the world
[02:57:41] <gwern> kuudes: sure, but sailors with fresh BBQ don't get shipwrecked every day!
[02:58:17] <kuudes> maybe they are like seals and sometimes go to shore
[02:58:52] <LeoTal> galambo: 3 reasons: 1) Minds tend to get stuck in ruts; a big whack with a drug stick will give you new ideas — worse ones on average, but new leads to follow that may produce insights you wouldn't have had otherwise. There's some vague evidence of long-term increases in creativity and openness. 2) A lot of people have trauma that keep them down (creates things they can't stand to do or think about), psychedelics might make those go
[02:58:52] <LeoTal>  away, and then you don't have to work around them. 3) Come on, aren't you curious what it's like?
[02:58:58] <gwern> kuudes: I am willing to bet that seals still smell/taste fishy even if they occasionally nosh on seagulls or something
[02:59:28] <kuudes> seals are one thing I haven't tasted
[02:59:42] <LeoTal> But *can* you kiss your cat? Most cats wouldn't cooperate
[03:00:33] <gwern> I can't bring myself to drink laphroaig either
[03:02:39] <galambo> LeoTal, the overall utility of drugs and psychadelics is negative. so if I kelly bet the answer will always be 'never try drugs'

[03:13:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, here's a dumb question, maybe there's something I don't understand, but: how do you use an oral thermometer? Stick it under your tongue, right?
[03:15:26] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, that's how my family always did it
[03:15:41] <gwern> although aren't those obsolete by forehead/ear thermometers now?
[03:15:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well I don't have one of those... why, is that better? More accurate?
[03:16:09] <gwern> more sanitary. dunno about more accurate
[03:16:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok well w/e, I wash this with soap after use
[03:16:26] <gwern> (but if you have a bunch of kids regularly getting sick, you can appreciate why skipping saliva would be attractive)
[03:16:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, several times over the past week I've been like "I feel feverish, do I have a fever?", taken my temperature, and gotten a result like... 96.2
[03:17:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Like just now that's what I got. 96.2°F. wtf?)
[03:17:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the device isn't broken! I literally just got some tap water to normal body temp and calibrated the oral meter against my probe-style kitchen thermometer - they agree to 0.1°F
[03:18:20] <gwern> I haven't been around sick people in a long time. what's bad about 96.2?
[03:19:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well normal is supposed to be 98.6. The latest doctrine is that if you go as low as like 97.5 (or comparably higher) that's still normal. But 96.2 is clearly below that, and in any case how do I square that with feeling feverish?
[03:19:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> This isn't the first time, either
[03:19:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do I have a generally way lower than average body temp...? But why would that be
[03:20:15] <gwern> you're a degenerate late-capitalism type. you have low T and low body temp
[03:20:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> :|
[03:21:06] <gwern> it's the pesticides and other hormones, you know. they turn the frogs gay, and the men into women and the women into tweeters
[03:22:26] <PlanckWalk> Did you leave the thermometer under your tongue long enough to stabilize in temperature?  (And hadn't just taken a mouthful of cold drink or something)
[03:22:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem with this is that if I don't know what normal is, for me, then I also have no idea when it's elevated... I mean, maybe it doesn't matter. I'm not making any critical decisions like "do or do not operate this forklift"
[03:22:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Yes and no
[03:22:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Left it until it beeped, hadn't just eaten or drunk anything, etc.
[03:23:03] <PlanckWalk> But on the whole, 1 C is not a huge difference in body temperature
[03:23:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> This isn't a one-time thing, again. This is a recurring weird thing
[03:23:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, according to the interwebs, it's (a) outside the normal range, (b) just 1°F away from "mild hypothermia"
[03:23:56] <PlanckWalk> Like, it varies by that much in most people just over the course of a day
[03:23:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, nah, it's probably fine, I just don't get *why* this would be
[03:27:19] <LeoTal> I'm told oral thermometers are unreliable and indeed have never used one. Here you get an armpit thermometer at the doctor's and a rectal one at home
[03:29:09] <PlanckWalk> Last time the doctor took my temperature it was an ear canal one.
[03:30:10] <PlanckWalk> Forehead temperatures vary a lot more, I'm not even sure why people use that.
[03:31:46] <LeoTal> I associate ear thermometers with vets

[05:55:17] <LeoTal> After rereading, this is my new understanding: Jessica was hired at CFAR in 2015, grew increasingly paranoid and self-hating, and had a psychotic break in 2017. Whoa, what happened? Well, she was worried about the mission being so important that any dissent might doom the world, but also about it being a dissent-suppressing cult: a double-bind where she's harmed and harms others either way. Also, the CFAR people kept telling her how t

[10:15:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I can't help but think that CFAR has turned out to be an example of that rule that if a country is named the People's Democratic Republic of wherever, this is a sure sign that it's not democratic at all and the people are actually super oppressed etc.
[10:16:19] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah i guess this seems roughly as bad as we thought it was back then
[10:16:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Center for Applied Rationality? More like the Center for Applied Irrationality amirite
[10:16:51] <nshepperd2> "Eliezer Yudkowsky: I worry that we’re shooting ourselves in the foot by telling ourselves that psychedelics “temporarily enable some self-modification capabilities” rather than doing shit to the brain that we don’t understand" EY channeling obormot lol
[10:17:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[10:18:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I find it hilarious that I looked up to CFAR years ago and even thought that working with them would be cool
[10:18:52] <PapuaHardyNet> they seemed like a less elitist MIRI - and not in the pejorative sense, more like "if you aren't a math genius, yeah, don't apply to MIRI, but to CFAR"
[10:18:56] <rsaarelm> EY's suggestion of shunning psychedelics and people talking about altering their surrounding reality with magic seems like a good starting point for anathema.
[10:19:21] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, what's the #lesswrong consensus on CFAR right now?
[10:19:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno if there is a consensus
[10:19:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> We're kind of just following the drama as it develops
[10:19:51] <rsaarelm> "Is CFAR still a thing?"
[10:19:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> #lw-rationalist-tabloids
[10:21:12] <rsaarelm> I mostly figured CFAR started out with the implicit bet of being able to instil rationalist skill in people with training, and is slowly losing the bet every year CFAR-trained people aren't winning more to a noticeable degree and in a way that can be plausibly traced back to them attending CFAR.
[10:21:47] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: it's a failure
[10:21:59] <nshepperd2> i approve of EY's anti-drugs decree, but it's probably too little too late
[10:23:16] <rsaarelm> We're in a bit of a weird place with psychedelics since legit psychedelics therapy is maybe emerging again.
[10:23:57] <PapuaHardyNet> let's do shrooms and hold hands and talk about our feelings
[10:24:30] <rsaarelm> And psychedelic therapy being legit useful and "feeling anxious, confused and fundamentally unmoored with your social surroundings, go hang out with Ziz and take a bunch of acid" being a bad idea can both be true.
[10:25:19] <rsaarelm> Just randomly eating random amounts of psych meds instead of going to a psychiatrist and following the prescription you get can also fuck you up.
[10:26:34] <PapuaHardyNet> only if you are already mentally vulnerable
[10:27:09] <PapuaHardyNet> (okay, I retract that statement, I'm not knowledgeable enough to state this)
[10:27:57] <rsaarelm> I'd guess eating random psych meds can fuck you up no matter where you start from.
[10:28:28] <rsaarelm> Though I get the idea that the dangers of psychedelics have been overstated and it really is more of an interaction with existing mental problems for them.
[10:28:30] <PapuaHardyNet> offtopic, but I'm now going to write Stripe Sigma SQL queries
[10:29:10] <PapuaHardyNet> can you guys recommend a good SQL reference? I used to use SQLite for my academic course, but since there are so many flavors of SQL, I'm curious as to whether there's a better solution to learn the fundamentals of SQL
[10:29:45] <PapuaHardyNet> ("use the Stripe Sigma docs!" yeah, but I'm trying to review SQL fundamentals. "then just reread your SQLite notes!" okay)
[10:34:11] <rsaarelm> Not me, never really worked seriously with databases. I just treated it like awk and basically googled up oneliners to do sorta maybe what I need.
[10:36:29] <nshepperd2> is there an o'reilly sql textbook
[10:36:46] <nshepperd2> that sounds like a plausible place to start

[10:45:04] <Urchin[emacs]> awk is really powerful if you want to get into it
[10:46:53] <rsaarelm> Problem with the old unix shell tools is that they're "three hours a week" languages, https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/01/31/three-hour-a-week-language/
[10:46:54] <Robomot> Using Perl three hours a week (You have to use Perl at least three hours a week for it to stay loaded in your head. Other languages may be less cool or powerful, but stick in your head better.)
[10:47:09] <rsaarelm> And I need awk like couple times a year rather than every week.
[10:48:23] <rsaarelm> I was looking at somenone's install setup the other day and it had some program that purported to be a modern-day replacement for awk with a more standard syntax. Forgot what it was.
[10:48:31] <PapuaHardyNet> agreed: I've found the standardness and ease of use of python much more useful than using awk for many text processing activities
[10:48:45] <rsaarelm> There's at least pyp and something called amber...
[10:48:52] <PapuaHardyNet> also yes, I do use awk when I want to pipe stuff (and therefore not use python)
[10:49:54] <rsaarelm> Yes, whatever the tool is it should have very good ergonomics for pipe oneliners.
[10:50:44] <kuudes> can't you just read the docs when you need it?
[10:50:54] <rsaarelm> Not really for a language.
[10:51:09] <kuudes> it has bad docs, eh?
[10:51:19] <rsaarelm> Well googling for oneliners is sort of "reading the docs", but not quite the same.
[10:52:02] <kuudes> do other people write code without using language documentation?
[10:52:05] <rsaarelm> It's the difference between having to look up an API function and having to look up how an if statement works.
[10:52:24] <rsaarelm> I need to look up how if statements work when writing bash scripts and it really makes me not want to use bash scripting.
[10:54:27] <rsaarelm> Like basic grammar vs advanced vocabulary in a human language. You can go "what's the word, the duck-beaver-animal with the poison spurs?" in a conversation and it's fine, but if you're struggling with basic grammar and conjugation and understanding core words, you feel much less fluent.
[10:54:37] <saturn2> perl has great docs
[10:55:02] <rsaarelm> People can be fluent in a language and have a small vocabulary, I guess that's a good enough analogy.
[10:55:25] <saturn2> it's just that there's a *lot* of syntax to remember
[10:56:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I found a much better o'reilly SQL book: "SQL and Relational Theory"
[10:57:13] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I think the johndcook post is a great concept.
[10:57:15] <PapuaHardyNet> unfortunately, which it is interesting and easy to read, and conceptual instead of mind-numbing docs
[10:57:20] <PapuaHardyNet> it is 653 pages
[10:59:04] <kuudes> what are you trying to solve?
[11:00:00] <Urchin[emacs]> awk is kind of like dynamic C with text stuff, depends on how much you interact with C if it's a 3-hour per week language, I guess
[11:00:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm going to write repeatable stripe sigma (which uses ansi SQL) repeatable queries to query the stripe database of the company I am working for
[11:00:59] <PapuaHardyNet> side objective (and probably a sub-objective tbh) is to improve my conceptual understanding with the use of SQL, if it is worth the effort
[11:01:51] <PapuaHardyNet> reading 1 chapter of this behemoth book seems like a good "exploration" strategy before I decide either to exploit the book or switch to stackoverflow+google to write and read sql queries
[11:02:19] <kuudes> those look like competing goals
[11:02:44] <PapuaHardyNet> really? why do you think so?
[11:06:32] <kuudes> how many queries will you write?
[11:07:13] <PapuaHardyNet> 4-13
[11:07:56] <PapuaHardyNet> all right, you make sense. I should be using a JIT learning for this. search+stackoverflow is good enough

[12:25:06] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, AKS on https://glowfic.com/posts/4582 makes me unable to use PageUp/PageDown for scrolling until I click inside the page; AKS has no visible effect on that page so the bug (which I also reported for twitter iirc) might be easy to fix by looking at this page?

[12:49:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Is there a reason you can't just ... disable AKS for that page? Since, as you say, it does nothing - there's no stickies that I can see...
[12:49:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or is this a bug report for completeness rather than a problem per se?)
[12:49:54] <Gurkenglas> Yes, completeness. It popped up twice so it's probably gonna pop up again, right? :)
[12:50:16] <Gurkenglas> And it feels like a one line fix somewhere so maybe twitter will just work with it after.
[12:50:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't recall this issue reported for twitter but tbh twitter has many more problems AKS-wise
[12:50:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't have a lot of hope of making AKS work with twitter tbh
[12:50:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> They put in a lot of effort into thwarting stuff like that
[12:51:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't compete with paid fulltime programmers...
[12:51:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> But as for this site, let's see
[12:51:39] <feep[work]> hm.
[12:51:43] <feep[work]> looking at all ongoing disk writes
[12:51:59] <feep[work]> I feel my nas will use a *lot* less power if I give it a dedicated disk drive for feepbot's data. :p
[12:52:14] <feep[work]> maybe a cute tiny ssd or something
[12:52:28] <feep[work]> cause afaict from lsof this is literally the only thing doing regular disk writes.
[12:52:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: I can certainly reproduce the bug...
[12:55:02] <Gurkenglas> right so seeing as there are no stickies we see the html diff between with-AKS and without should be short, yes? *clueless*
[12:58:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ironically...
[12:58:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is caused by an AKS feature designed to restore scrollability to sites where fullscreen stickies disable it
[12:58:32] <Gurkenglas> :D
[12:58:41] <feep[work]> amusingly, it follows that running feepbot is actually insanely expensive for me rn
[12:58:52] <feep[work]> probably the most expensive thing I'm doing month over month XD
[12:59:07] <Gurkenglas> updating to: any page where AKS does anything when it should do nothing is a worthy bug report
[12:59:27] <feep[work]> can anyone recommend me a good reliable usb stick?
[12:59:55] <feep[work]> demands: should not crap out after half a year of one small write a minute
[13:00:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: It always does something when it's enabled
[13:00:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not a bug, it's the design
[13:00:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no reliable way to tell when something should be done, so something is always done
[13:00:36] <Gurkenglas> What does it always do?
[13:00:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Restores scrollability, like I said
[13:01:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> AlwaysKillSticky's policy toward the site "features" it's designed to eliminate is "nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure"
[13:01:27] <cpopell> @PapuaHardyNet  as someone who learned sql to pass a job interview then used it heavily
[13:01:31] <cpopell> galaxql is a great start
[13:02:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is impractical to conduct a detailed investigation to determine the extent or even presence of the infestation before nuking
[13:02:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> The bad things could be hiding in all sorts of ways
[13:03:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> That said, I've confirmed that the "can't scroll with pgup/etc. before click" is not a general bug, it's something endemic to this website...
[13:05:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah yes, I see
[13:05:06] <Gurkenglas> Is it because PageUp is passed by default to the outermost element that permits scrolling, so it doesn't in this case make it to the element within you'd usually scroll?
[13:05:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's because the layout of this page is weird
[13:05:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[13:05:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Something like that, anyway
[13:06:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's because, in CSS, sometimes setting a property to the value it already has by default causes the layout engine to do something different than if you just let that property take on that same value by default
[13:07:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's really no principled way to prevent this
[13:07:31] <Gurkenglas> asche on their haupt!
[13:07:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> The solution for the user is just "disable AKS on this page"

Technically, this was not about drugs but some _supplements_ (i.e. completely legal things), but there was someone mixing various kinds of powders and saying “yeah, trust me, I have a lot of experience with this, I did a lot of research, it is perfectly safe to take a dose this high, really”, and then an ambulance
[13:09:57] <Obormot\Arcturus>  had to be called.
[13:09:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, I assume you meant that Olivia goes even _far beyond this_, right?"
[13:11:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know, maybe we could look at this sort of thing as a test. You come to a "rationality minicamp" and a random-ass person starts mixing "various kinds of powders" and goes "trust me" - do you injest this concoction? Yes? Well guess what, you just failed rationality. You are the weakest rationalist - goodbye!
[13:12:27] <Gurkenglas> So I go to google and I search for "I don’t remember specific names, but something similar happened at one of the first rationality minicamps. Technically, this was not about drugs but some" and I get 1 result: "https://www.lesswrong.com". Sounds about right.

[14:03:06] <kuudes> yes, mysql and postgres are quite similar. I think ms sql and db2 have much weirder tidbits
[14:03:41] <kuudes> window functions are a pita
[14:03:53] <mst> I need to care about those rarely enough these days that it doesn't really factor into my calculations
[14:03:58] <kuudes> but usually one is just doing random selects and inserts
[14:04:19] <kuudes> corporations seem to use db2 and ms sql often
[14:04:29] <mst> I ... don't tend to get called in for the easy stuff
[14:04:34] <kuudes> :)
[14:04:38] <mst> so my perception is going to be skewed by that
[14:04:42] <kuudes> yes
[14:05:07] <kuudes> my presumption is that the thing at hand was those random selects etc
[14:05:39] <mst> querying the stripe db sounded like it would likely be analytics-style queries
[14:05:54] <mst> who knows which of us guessed right though
[14:06:12] <kuudes> indeed
[14:06:51] <kuudes> but I would still presume they would not need to plan the db but plan the queries
[14:07:20] <kuudes> but I don't know. it just feels that likely it is not useful to read 600 pages to make 13 queries
[14:07:23] <mst> right, but for analytics you're going to want group by, aggregates, and possibly window functions
[14:07:30] <kuudes> yes
[14:07:39] <mst> also SQL is freaking everywhere so front-loading it isn't necessarily a bad thing
[14:07:53] <kuudes> well, sure. but that is different from task at hand
[14:07:58] <mst> I guess ... *sunglasses* ... it depends on your EV
[14:08:03] <kuudes> hoo
[14:09:03] <kuudes> but this was a thing I stressed while I TA'd at university. the first thing I took the students to was the online documentation and showed how to drill to a point in documentation
[14:09:23] <kuudes> ie when you write java, you do not read the thousand page language spec first and then start to code
[14:09:41] <kuudes> but you often may need to check some specific structure or api etc
[14:09:59] <mst> I tend to read documentation end to end, not to memorise it, but because it leaves echoes in my brain of what's there to look up later, which makes it much more likely if there's something suitable to a problem I'm facing I can drill down to the right doc page quickly
[14:10:30] <mst> basically priming the relevant neuron cluster so it acts as a first phase heuristic index into the feature space
[14:10:38] <kuudes> makes sense
[14:11:25] <mst> and while, yes, that's a fair investment, the more often you do it, the faster you can do it, so how much of an investment it is in each incremental case drops noticeably over time
[14:12:03] <mst> same, I find, goes for reading source code of libraries and frameworks to get a feel for the right mental model to use when interacting with them
[14:12:38] <mst> which is the other thing - taking the approach I'm describing is -also- an investment into being able to efficiently take that approach
[14:12:56] <mst> so if you have the time to do so, it's an investment that gives compounding interest in terms of capabilities
[14:13:06] <mst> that still doesn't mean it's the universally correct approach, of course
[14:13:33] <mst> but it does mean that IMO people underestimate how often it's the right approach strategically even if not necessarily immediately/tactically

[16:42:36] <pompolic> if you wanted to train GANs on your own machine, what sort of spec would you need? i assume RAM and GPU memory would be the most pertinent parameters, how much would a midrange GAN machine would need of those?

[17:50:58] <[itchyjunk]> Interview questions always sounds like nightmare anytime someone talks about them.
[17:51:07] <[itchyjunk]> Yet they seem to be very popular.
[17:51:23] <[itchyjunk]> Wonder where the disconnect is. The employer just doesn't care?
[17:52:55] <gwern> I think it's that hiring is so noisy that you don't get feedback, most people are under very strong cognitive illusions about how these things work, there's incentive for people to do the hiring to make themselves vital to the process instead of using a checklist or simple statistical model (also, it's less boring), and it is actually very hard to do it right
[17:53:15] <gwern> so it's very easy to do the easy fun intuitive thing, it'll hurt the company, but no one will know, including you
[17:54:01] <gwern> wouldn't you rather ask riddles about prisoners in cells or your favorite C undefined edge case than sit around waiting for them to do a work-sample test or ask them the same set of questions you asked the last 20 candidates?
[17:55:04] <gwern> the I/O literature has loads of information about how you should basically just be doin an IQ test, structured interview, and work-sample test, and ignoring everything else, based on literally n ~ millions over a century. but no one wants to hear it
[17:55:20] <gwern> (except the US army, which makes heavy use of it as it's validated it extensively)

[18:01:49] <gwern> kiboneu: sounds like a work-sample test
[18:01:52] <feep> "write a thing that sorts a csv file by a chosen column"

[18:03:25] <kiboneu> yeah
[18:03:33] <kiboneu> yeah it was a work-sample test
[18:03:38] <feep> though if they do sort -k, I may ask them to do it without sort -k :P

[18:04:29] <kiboneu> it also selected for certain personalities
[18:04:46] <kiboneu> so it was in part a culture fit test
[18:04:48] <kiboneu> hehehe
[18:05:05] * mst likes "did I already give this person a commit bit to something"
[18:05:14] <mst> since that also selects for them being able to tolerate working with me ;)
[18:05:34] <kiboneu> tolerance is te key word here
[18:05:41] <kiboneu> mysteries require so much of that
[18:06:19] <mst> some people think I'm a massive asshole and hate the way I give feedback
[18:06:30] <mst> other people say that they find me the best mentor they've ever had
[18:06:48] <mst> I want to avoid accidentally hiring anybody in the first group, because it'll be no fun for either of us
[18:06:52] <feep> why, how do you give feedback
[18:07:08] <kiboneu> i do it to improve my environment
[18:07:20] <kiboneu> but it also helps other people if they care of it
[18:07:27] <feep> <mst> I'm just way too nice and patient, some people feel I'm going too slow for them
[18:07:34] <mst> *snrk*
[18:07:50] <kiboneu> i have trouble with people who speak slowly :(
[18:08:25] <kiboneu> but it's still worth being patient because i may think I'm lightyears ahead when im not
[18:09:00] <feep> I'd already read the daily wtf for a few years when I joined my first proper fulltime job (current job)
[18:09:17] <LeoTal> Surely writing fixes that? The impatient can skim
[18:09:20] <feep> so I came into it thinking that p much everything is shit and you cannot trust any software ever; the deeper your stack, the more broken it is
[18:09:26] <feep> and um... far as I can tell, that was entirely correct.
[18:09:27] <kiboneu> LeoTal: indeed it does
[18:10:23] <LeoTal> That said, "he won't get to the motherfucking point already arrrrghhhh" doesn't usually cause people to think you're a massive asshole. Tactlessness and selfishness are more likely causes
[18:11:30] <kiboneu> my experience with people, most of the time, my autocomplete matches what they're trying to say, and if they speak quickly enough I can better match my internal autocomplete with what they are saying to make sure it's correct
[18:12:03] <kiboneu> when the belabour the point... i'm gone, i try not to be but take less barbituates and then let's talk
[18:12:18] <kiboneu> it feels like everyone is on barbituates nowadays
[18:12:32] <kiboneu> barbiturates
[18:12:42] <feep> I kinda had an interaction like that when we had in-person conferences
[18:13:07] <kiboneu> i see thinking like riding on a scooter
[18:13:08] <feep> er, meetings
[18:13:13] <feep> our team leader was like "I think we should have a rule that people don't look at phones during meetings"
[18:13:28] <feep> and I was like "yeah well I think we should have a rule that people can leave a meeting they're not contributing to"
[18:13:31] <feep> I may have also been like ":V"
[18:13:39] <kiboneu> lel
[18:13:59] <kiboneu> i think you were right though
[18:14:10] <feep> but actually it was a lot more civil like that because we're mostly pretty friendly, in the sort of fatalistic german way of "it's just us against all the crap and incompetence that permeates the field"
[18:14:13] <kiboneu> dwarf fortress taught me a lot about managing humans
[18:14:17] <LeoTal> I like cooperative interrupting "ah, so then the foobar bazquxes the fumzot?" "yes, and then the corge—" "graults the flarp?" "no, it waldoes the plugh" "ah, got it!". But some people find it rude, and others can't listen well enough to play along
[18:14:30] <kiboneu> one thing is that you can't just disallow people from doing things, you just have to address the environmnet
[18:14:44] <kiboneu> LeoTal: yep, i do that all the time
[18:14:45] <feep> well also it's a problem that's very conveniently solved itself by means of corona
[18:14:54] <feep> now people have ~no idea~ if I'm on my phone!
[18:14:57] <LeoTal> kiboneu: With good results?
[18:14:58] <kiboneu> LeoTal: it's great
[18:15:01] <kiboneu> yep
[18:15:09] <kiboneu> particulaly with geeks / tech people
[18:15:16] <kiboneu> er
[18:15:23] <Gurkenglas> me too
[18:15:26] <kiboneu> technical people in terms of deep into a subject
[18:15:27] <LeoTal> My friends enjoy it (they're selected for it) but many coworkers don't
[18:15:51] <feep> I think the only time I'll be like "hang on lemme finish" is when I'm trying to build to a story payoff
[18:16:26] <feep> like, when I'm trying to tell the story of the issue in a certain way~
[18:16:39] <kiboneu> it's a great way to catch where you're wrong. you bring your thinking out unto a shared space and they can just say "no", and maybe you can ask to clarify or say no to that, and etc. but in any case
[18:16:42] <kiboneu> it's usually yes
[18:16:47] <feep> yeah
[18:17:05] <feep> also lol
[18:17:08] <feep> my gaming pc has two ssds
[18:17:14] <feep> and a hard drive
[18:17:16] <kiboneu> raid0 that shit
[18:17:18] <feep> the hard drive has linux on it
[18:17:21] <feep> the ssd has windows
[18:17:27] <feep> I have not booted that windows in over a year.
[18:17:27] <rmmh> raid0 the ssd to the hard drive, coward
[18:17:32] <feep> rofl
[18:17:41] <kiboneu> yeah raid0 everything you got
[18:17:45] <feep> oh no it's even worse
[18:17:48] <kiboneu> rolo
[18:17:52] <kiboneu> *yolo
[18:17:52] <rmmh> disk drive suicide pact
[18:17:54] <feep> to speed up hdd access
[18:18:00] <feep> I'm not loading games from the hdd
[18:18:03] <feep> I load them from a nfs share.
[18:18:10] <rmmh> oh god
[18:18:10] <feep> THE SSDS ARE TOTALLY UNUSED.
[18:18:14] <rmmh> over wifi?

[18:18:18] <kiboneu> mdraid*
[18:18:19] <feep> rmmh: no, gbit
[18:18:22] <feep> so there is that
[18:18:48] <feep> and it's honestly plenty fast.
[18:18:56] <kiboneu> i should play vidya again. last time i did that i sunk 40 hours straight into factorio, so i decided to take a break
[18:19:03] <feep> hahahahaha
[18:19:15] <kiboneu> my map was sushi belt heaven
[18:19:18] <feep> oh were you the guy I got into playing factorio? did you keep going?
[18:19:27] <feep> or who was that
[18:19:38] <kiboneu> probably not, but the fellow who did is in this channel
[18:19:44] <kiboneu> so, perhaps indirectly
[18:19:54] <feep> oh it was PapuaHardyNet

[18:20:04] <feep> also oh god sushi belt why, no

[18:21:19] <kiboneu> it's like

[18:21:40] <rmmh> and playing factorio-type games like notch

[18:23:05] <kiboneu> i wonder if i'll have any left
[18:23:53] <feep> reject nature
[18:23:57] <feep> return to factvry

[18:29:10] <feep> random funny note

[18:30:45] <feep> this is, ostensibly, supposed to name "nameless cults" or "unspeakable cults", however, this would be better translated as "unsäglichen kulten"
[18:31:08] <feep> and while the name is valid, it also has an alternate meaning: "unpronounceable cults" :P

[18:35:52] <kiboneu> create some pressure not to die

[18:38:48] <pompolic> bartle go brr
[18:39:12] <pompolic> i've been going through that book but i mentioned that a few times already
[18:39:30] <pompolic> also, scrollback: i've started asking people to repeat things they said but faster
[18:39:32] <LeoTal> Man this doesn't even address why I play games in the first place
[18:40:00] <kiboneu> LeoTal: why do you play games in the first place?
[18:40:04] <LeoTal> pompolic: Does that work? I think I couldn't do that
[18:40:13] <pompolic> nnnnot sure
[18:40:17] <pompolic> it's multiple things
[18:40:26] <LeoTal> Well, what happens when you do it?
[18:40:35] <pompolic> on a moment-to-moment level, i am very bad at actually turning back speech to words in my head
[18:40:56] <[itchyjunk]> I am reading a book with lot of pictures and i thought it would get done quick because of the pictures but it's the opposite. Taking way longer than expected because of the pictures I think.
[18:41:09] <pompolic> for mysterious reasons, faster speech sometimes works better
[18:41:23] <pompolic> on a longer timescale, i simply just get distracted 
[18:41:37] <pompolic> i also have an autocomplete but it's not very good
[18:41:44] <pompolic> but it will make my attention drift
[18:41:53] <pompolic> i think i need more data before i can say whether it works or not
[18:42:57] <kiboneu> I think everyone has autocomplete, but end up trusting it too much as they get older
[18:43:15] <pompolic> i agree
[18:43:29] <LeoTal> kiboneu: I'm a very heavy interactive fiction player and play almost no other genres. I want a good story (somewhat addressed), good puzzles (vaguely touched on), no time pressure, mechanical rewards that are *the same thing* as lore, the concept of competition usually doesn't apply (so "how do you like to compete" gets "mu")
[18:43:54] <LeoTal> pompolic: I meant I'd probably be unable to rephrase more concisely or to talk faster, if asked on the spot
[18:44:30] <kiboneu> it sounds like your preferences are captured under 'exploring'
[18:44:53] <kiboneu> it's not scoped to just exploring maps, but also story / lore
[18:45:06] <pompolic> i was also going to say "ah an explorer i see"
[18:45:18] <LeoTal> I don't disagree with the classifications themselves, just the quiz
[18:45:27] <rmmh> LeoTal: this is the most hipster gaming stance I've ever read, nice
[18:45:31] <kiboneu> i'm pretty similar, though i'm super into breaking game mechanics...
[18:45:59] <rmmh> (not as an aspersion, I'm just impressed at the existence of your class of gamers)
[18:46:16] <pompolic> LeoTal: yeah, i don't expect most people to be able to do that, so i try to limit it to people who don't mind. i model the thing i have as a buffer underrun, if it underruns i get distracted
[18:46:38] <pompolic> kiboneu: playing games badly is my passion
[18:46:52] <kiboneu> pompolic: it's like you are trying to keep your 60+ stage pipeline filled up!
[18:47:29] <pompolic> using the first person shooter twitch machinery to process speech
[18:47:55] <pompolic> by all rights i should be very good at lexing french...but i'm not
[18:47:57] <LeoTal> I do have a big Achiever streak (usually more tedium than it's worth in IF, but good in puzzle games — I loved 100%ing Baba Is You), and a few Killer aspects in some games (the fiance and I play a ton of chess). But yeah definitely mainly Explorer
[18:48:25] <pompolic> i think last time i did the bartle test i got explorer
[18:48:35] <LeoTal> pompolic: Rephrase the French thing? "Lexing" as in tokenising?
[18:48:47] <kiboneu> pompolic: you know what's funny? similar autocomplete machinery is evoked while REing shit
[18:49:28] <kiboneu> god this can be generalized to basically predictive processing or w/e
[18:49:34] <pompolic> and there's an extension to his model that adds an implicit/explicit axis (for explorer, it's basically whether you poke things to see what happens (Hacker, implicit), or break out the excel sheets (Scientist, explicit)
[18:49:42] <LeoTal> rmmh: I'm clearly evolving towards being a person of hipness (I've gotten into craft beer, too) but I'm unclear what's H-wordish about this
[18:49:46] <pompolic> LeoTal: yep, splitting the stream of sounds into lexical tokens
[18:50:05] <pompolic> francophones do be like eoeueoeueoe, non?
[18:50:21] <rmmh> "hipster" as enjoying  things that aren't popular
[18:50:32] <pompolic> kiboneu: interesting, can you give an example?
[18:50:53] <LeoTal> Oh how did that tumblr post go… "I wrote a poem comparing the gap between the lightning and the thunder to the gap between hearing people in a movie say something and understanding what they said, definitely a relatable experience that everyone has had"
[18:51:30] <LeoTal> rmmh: There's a huge IF boom right now though. If I want to be hip I need to get back to playing Nethack
[18:51:58] <kiboneu> pompolic: rtos structures, regularity of visual patterns that can be inferred from jump tables, squinting at a trace while it runs and inferring the categories of input modifications to changes in control flow and system components
[18:52:15] <rmmh> LeoTal: does Heaven's Vault tickle your fancy?
[18:52:18] <kiboneu> finding common asm that relates to copying memory
[18:52:29] <pompolic> ohhhh
[18:52:33] <pompolic> okay i get it
[18:52:44] <rmmh> kiboneu: the best part of REing without symbol names is that there's no text to lie to you about what a funtion does
[18:52:56] <pompolic> i fancy myself a RE but i feel my skills aren't all that good
[18:53:01] <kiboneu> making assumptyions about what engineers ought to do, given that they are l;azy humans like i am, and then using that assumption to guide your analysis of the program
[18:53:02] <rmmh> documentation, comments, and names lie. code tells the truth
[18:53:09] <pompolic> however i think an example i encountered is "oh that's a dispatch table"
[18:53:44] <kiboneu> rmmh: i trust nothing, but print / debug statements are usually trustworthy yeah
[18:53:48] <kiboneu> wait
[18:53:54] <pompolic> funny factoid
[18:53:55] <kiboneu> fuck disregard that sentence
[18:54:10] <pompolic> in PSX binaries, the standard library is usually stripped
[18:54:21] <kiboneu> rmmh: anyway yeah. i don't trust clients when they talk about how their thing works
[18:54:30] <pompolic> however almost all of the functions have a debug print function (that goes to the serial console afaik) that tells you the function's name
[18:54:38] <kiboneu> there's often a lot of deviation between process, policy and reality
[18:54:42] <pompolic> ^
[18:54:54] <kiboneu> pompolic: yep
[18:55:11] <rmmh> good disassemblers have ways to pattern match library functions
[18:55:20] <kiboneu> yeah ida pro has lumina
[18:55:22] <rmmh> or build a database of names from an unstripped binary and cross-apply it
[18:55:23] <kiboneu> for instance
[18:55:28] <feep> good disassemblers have ways to make you talk
[18:55:48] <pompolic> back when i was doing RE more intensely, i think i could spot printf by looking
[18:55:53] <kiboneu> program interrogation platfor=m
[18:55:54] <pompolic> well, GNU printf specifically i think
[18:56:21] <pompolic> also i think this is what the zignatures functionality in radare2 is about
[18:56:28] <LeoTal> rmmh: The basic idea of "here's a language, allez Champollion" does; Jon Ingold does; but the UI would probably annoy me (don't give me animations! only text and static images!); so overall it's not worth the massive hassle of acquiring a way to run it (simplest would be installing a Windows VM)
[18:56:39] <kiboneu> last week i dumped a ppc device and i gosome tasks and a scheduler under an emulator
[18:57:00] <rmmh> Steam's Linux support through Proton (nee WINE) is excellent, fyi
[18:57:04] <kiboneu> i have to mock a timer so get it to work properly
[18:57:04] <pompolic> more weird PSX factoids
[18:57:10] <rmmh> they have dumped a ton of money into it
[18:57:11] <pompolic> i took a stab at reversing Spyro the Dragon
[18:57:57] <pompolic> turns out the game is just while(true) { switch(gamestate) { case menu: do_menu(); case game: do_game(); case loading: do_loading(); } }
[18:58:00] <pompolic> at a high level
[18:58:08] <kiboneu> nice
[18:58:12] <LeoTal> I have something of an anti-Steam stance, though most games are distributed through more than one platform so it works
[18:58:12] <kiboneu> state machine
[18:58:18] <pompolic> which is not really interesting, but you can basically go to a loading screen by poking one variable
[18:58:45] <pompolic> (and also corrupt VRAM by poking the same variable, somehow, i forget)
[18:58:56] <gwern> speedrun?
[18:59:03] <pompolic> i think if you do game -> loading -> game, it'll get confused
[18:59:12] <pompolic> which is understandable
[18:59:43] <kiboneu> see, here's what my autocomplete says here: they designed the game entgine modeled after a state diagram
[18:59:55] <kiboneu> does the pattern follow when you further REd it?
[18:59:58] <pompolic> i don't know what speedrunners do with it; RetroArch just lets you PEEK/POKE memory
[19:00:05] <gwern> kiboneu: obviously, since everything is structured as a tree
[19:00:29] <kiboneu> gwern: but humans don't necessarily design things with that in mind
[19:00:41] <kiboneu> the abstraction they work with is built into the pattern language of the thing
[19:00:43] <gwern> ents do. that's why they're better at growing software ecosystems than us
[19:00:47] <kiboneu> hehe
[19:00:48] <rmmh> kiboneu: eh it's just a typical main game loop structure
[19:00:50] <kiboneu> yeh
[19:00:54] <kiboneu> everything is a tree though, i agree
[19:00:56] <pompolic> kiboneu: i don't know offhand, but quite possibly
[19:00:56] <rmmh> design pattern, kind of
[19:01:04] <pompolic> it's not a unusual pattern to have a main loop like that either
[19:01:10] <rmmh> you have a while loop to do the rendering / timing
[19:01:18] <kiboneu> rmmh: i've seen some wild shit
[19:01:20] <pompolic> i'd look, but radare2 still eats project files
[19:01:22] <kiboneu> but i have to go to work
[19:01:27] <rmmh> and maybe call different update/rendering functions based on states
[19:01:33] <kiboneu> i've seen things you wouldn't believe
[19:01:47] <kiboneu> that made me go "wtf were they smoking and i want some" out loud
[19:01:54] <LeoTal> I'd have assumed that the standard thingy is to have a game loop, and a menu loop, and they exit into each other. Not an overarching "ah shit which one am I doing now?" loop
[19:01:55] <pompolic> supremely relatable
[19:02:23] <rmmh> the compiler provides a sheen of deniability for many "what the fuck" questions in binary code
[19:02:26] <pompolic> on the contrary
[19:02:31] <kiboneu> anyway, off to the office, ttyl and will read scrollback
[19:02:46] <pompolic> often i think they implement menus as levels
[19:02:51] <pompolic> _especially_ in UE2
[19:02:59] <pompolic> where even the intro cinematics are levels
[19:03:03] <kiboneu> rmmh: at the abstractions that compilers can do optimizations on yes
[19:03:09] <pompolic> although the menu might not be in UT2004, i dunno how that one works
[19:03:14] <kiboneu> i.e. peephole and cfg
[19:04:09] <pompolic> not the only way to go about it, but i think it happens often enough, and then your main loop is effectively the "what am i doing now" loop
[19:05:03] *** Quits: two2thehead (~user@124.195.204.230) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[19:05:15] <pompolic> also having a structure like do_setup(); while(wantToQuit=false) { run_game(); } do_teardown(); is i think practically guaranteed

[23:16:54] <Dyo> made some pizza on aluminum plates. would have to do direct comparison but I'd say it works as well or better than regular pizza stone plate.
[23:18:13] <Dyo> and takes <15 min to heat up vs the stones 60 min+
[23:18:20] <kiboneu> lower thermal mass
[23:18:27] <Dyo> 15mm
[23:19:21] <kiboneu> with the right PID loop you can make almost anything cook on anything, the problem is moisture control
[23:19:52] <kiboneu> the trick is to add ingredients in the order required to introduce the amount of moisture that you want while cooking
[23:20:28] <kiboneu> i.e. corn has lots of moisture and doesn't require that much heating; beans, fibres / bread and legumes absorb moisture, and so on
[23:22:05] <Dyo> you can pre-bake the dough or add a thin layer of shredded cheese to prevent the sauce soaking too much into the crust, if you mean that
[23:22:52] <kiboneu> yep same idea

[23:33:08] <ggreer> I'm interviewing a guy and he has his camera off and he sounds a *lot* like tyler cowen
[23:33:58] <kiboneu> little did you know that he also idles on #lesswrong
[23:34:08] <pompolic> kiboneu: i think i was kind of mistaken, kind of not, about Spyro. either it's less obviously a state machine, or i labeled things wrong
[23:34:21] <kiboneu> pompolic: ah, that happens
[23:34:31] <ggreer> if cowen learned terraform and a bunch of AWS stuff and lurked here, I'd totally hire him
[23:34:48] <kiboneu> hehe
[23:34:50] <pompolic> i do have a "hud_state" address that controls the whole thing, but it's a bit more involved it seems
[23:35:18] <kiboneu> (i need to focus on work so my irc pane gets hidden for the next x time)

[23:54:26] <catern> i don't get timezone people
[23:54:47] <catern> i've known two people who are "into timezones" now
[23:54:58] <catern> seems like an utter and complete waste of your mental energy
[23:55:32] <catern> both of them were CS PhD students, although at very different tiers
[23:55:46] <catern> seems like you could be doing more interesting things with your brain
[23:56:03] <dv^_^_> better than obsessed with fonts
[23:56:43] <pompolic> hey now, font rendering is actually turing complete
[23:56:55] <pompolic> it's a valid architecture
