[01:50:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I doubt this!

We said, ‘Do you audit the lab?’ And they said, ‘Annually.’ ‘Did you audit it after the outbreak?’ ‘Yes.’ `Was anything found?’ ‘No.’ ‘Do you test your staff?’ ‘Yes.’ No one was—” The correspondent, Lesley Stahl, interrupted: “But you’re just taking their word for it.” Daszak responded, “Well,

[10:53:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In her so-called “summer” interview on German TV last Sunday, Chancellor Angela Merkel categorically ruled out “combat missions by German soldiers in Iraq under any circumstances”. Barely four days later, she has agreed to the deployment of Bundeswehr soldiers in Iraq under conditions that can very quickly lead to combat.
[10:53:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Following its intervention in Afghanistan, the mission of the Bundeswehr was still largely presented as participation in allegedly “purely humanitarian missions” such as building schools and drilling wells. In reality, heavily armed soldiers are then sent to protect the “humanitarian soldiers” and permitted to engage in combat missions. In the end, the Bundeswehr is fully involved in war, utilizing the type of brutal
[10:53:31] <Obormot\Arcturus>  methods that resulted in the massacre at Kunduz (Afghanistan) in the autumn of 2009."

[10:54:09] <feep[work]> right
[10:54:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> And?
[10:54:26] <feep[work]> so like, the us hegemony is such that, ten years after combat starts, a key ally reluctantly sends some guys to not fight.

[10:56:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The initial invasion of Iraq included troops from the UK, Australia, Poland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain.
[10:56:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was in 2003.

[10:56:46] <feep[work]> more interesting is who it did not include.
[10:56:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whom it DID include is countries that weren't the U.S.!

[10:57:58] <nshepperd2> does italy even exist
[10:58:05] <feep[work]> yes! the us was like "guys come help us smash this guy" and some countries, two of which were publically known for being in the US' pocket, said yes
[10:58:42] <feep[work]> I'm not saying the US can't be convincing, I'm saying NATO is not just a US appendage for all foreign policy purposes.
[10:58:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, it is
[10:58:53] <feep[work]> that's overly reductionist.
[10:59:00] <feep[work]> it is attached to the us, but it has its own mass.
[10:59:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not much of one!
[10:59:17] <feep[work]> more than russia's appendages!
[11:00:03] <feep[work]> and I mean, um, if you don't join or even support the other person's wars then what good are you as an appendage

[11:02:06] <feep[work]> anyway, I probably stand somewhere between you, I do think international politics has viable overton windows
[11:02:38] <feep[work]> and they're to a good extent dependent on a shared agreement
[11:03:13] <feep[work]> actually, funny example, look at how eu support for ukraine lined up
[11:03:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: The point is this: we invaded Iraq, and France, Germany, some others, *didn't send troops to help*, *at first* (but eventually did). Here's what they didn't do: anything *against us*
[11:03:29] <feep[work]> first there's a bunch of toothless declarations, whose point is more to establish common knowledge
[11:03:42] <nshepperd2> sure
[11:03:52] <feep[work]> then some small countries who don't have much to lose take the first step, and everybody looks if one of the important players will contradict it

[15:40:16] <dbohdan[phone]> I have tried to get into Scala several times now. It is one of the few "practical" PLs with an advanced type system and abundant libraries. Scala 3 looks more appealing than any previous version. Reading the trending codebases on GitHub is what scares me off. They seem very complex in terms of structure and data flow. I haven't noticed the same effect with Clojure codebases, which tend to be straightforward.
[15:41:32] <gurkenglas> Does modern physics have an idea by now of the type signatures that our universe is an implementation of?
[15:42:47] <rsaarelm> Rust has a pretty nice balance of mutability and immutability.
[15:42:57] <rsaarelm> Not sure how it scales up to a really large system.
[15:43:17] <feep[work]> something something D~
[15:44:04] <gurkenglas> dbohdan[phone]: has your fear of the complexity taken into account how much real estate the same logic would have taken in another language?
[15:44:26] <feep[work]> real estate is not the only consideration.

[15:50:45] <dbohdan[phone]> rsaarelm: Right. It's my favorite part of Rust. I enjoy writing it in general. It isn't up there with the JVM in terms of libraries (number AND maturity), however, and I am skeptical about using it for the sort of string-heavy web and business logic stuff I want to do.

[15:56:44] <feep[work]> crazy
[15:56:46] <dbohdan[phone]> feep[work]: I wouldn't call D's type system "advanced". It's a more conventional OO+procedural language. (Which is fine!)
[15:57:23] <feep[work]> oyeah, definitely, it's very C-y
[15:58:07] <feep[work]> it's not linear or hindley-milner
[15:58:32] <feep[work]> I'd say about D, it's not advanced but it is powerful.
[15:59:30] <feep[work]> though imo the benefit of freeform type inference is overrated.

[17:34:19] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : 'Cultural outsiders, like immigrants or international students, often struggle to make friends. We report evidence that one barrier to social connection is not knowing what it means to be socially competent in the host culture. First-year students (N=1306) at a U.S. business school completed a social network survey and reported the social competence of themselves and several peers. International students were rated by peers as 
[17:34:20] <two2thehead> less socially competent than U.S. students, especially if they were from more culturally dissimilar nations. As evidence that international students were applying culturally mismatched standards, their self-reported competence ratings were uncorrelated with their peers’ judgments of them. Social network analysis revealed international students were less connected than U.S. students, although this gap was reduced if their peers rated them a
[17:34:20] <two2thehead> s socially competent. Since learning local norms takes time, we suggest inclusivity will require host communities to define social competence more broadly.'
[17:34:57] <dbohdan[phone]> two2thehead: It does implement search
[17:37:05] <capisce> how do you "define social competence more broadly", and how will that improve inclusivity?
[17:37:47] <capisce> if we define incels as being socially competent, will that make it easier for them to get laid?
[17:40:31] <two2thehead> 'Students rated themselves and several peers using the Emotional and Social Competencies Inventory (ESCI), which measures competence in self-management, relationship management, self-awareness, and social awareness (Boyatzis & Goleman, 2007). We calculated the differences between how students rated themselves and how their peer evaluators rated them on all ESCI subscales. Because standards for social competence are culturally relative (Stankov, 
[17:40:31] <two2thehead> 2015), we consider the peer-ratings to be a students’ “ground truth” competence by local standards. The more a student disagrees with their peers’ judgments of their own competence, the less accurate they are in their culturally-relative self-knowledge'
[17:40:48] <two2thehead> I guess it helps if I link the study https://psyarxiv.com/rk2pc/
[17:41:41] <two2thehead> capisce, how did you get 'define incels as socially competent'?
[17:42:08] <capisce> that was just an example
[17:43:01] <two2thehead> I took the above to mean that if you want to improve the social interconnection between students, the policy could be to mention that certain allowances may be needed to fully understand the pov of int students

[17:44:13] <capisce> yep, but how do you modify social behavior in that way?

[23:01:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> More magical consumer products from the GDR: https://digitalcosmonaut.com/2020/superfest-ceverit-glass-ddr/
[23:01:59] <Robomot> Superfest - The (almost) unbreakable East German Glass (Originally named ceverit, Superfest was an extremely durable glass patented and developed in 1979 in East Germany to combat excessive glass waste.)
[23:02:45] <rmmh> splitting chores in a relationship is an instance of the iteration prisoner's dilemma 
[23:02:53] <rmmh> iterated*
[23:03:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "While the German Democratic Republic might suffer from the stigma today that it was technologically backward (which was true for certain fields), it was a creative and adaptive country which produced world class products and technology that’s still in use today (many of today’s planetariums are still equipped by technology invented in the GDR)." ... wow! I had no idea
[23:06:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Interestingly enough – the name Ceverit was phased out before production began and replaced with “Superfest (Super Hard), as someone noticed that “Ceverit” was a conjugated form of the Latin word “cevere”, which translates to “wiggling your butt while having sex”. Opportunity missed in my opinion."
[23:06:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Despite their commercial success in East Germany, the production plant in Schewpnitz was shut down on the 1st of July, 1990. After German reunification, the plant was sold off and scrapped piece by piece – as no manufacturer had any interest in the technology, or in a product which would actually “slow down” sales. And that’s (just one of many small) tragedies of German reunification. Superfest was an invention that
[23:06:40] <Obormot\Arcturus>  maybe could have only been made under a “socialist” system – it was a product that solved a problem, but wasn’t dependent on inflated sales figure due planned obsolescence." ... yep
[23:07:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "While the Superfest glass is by far more durable than normal glass, when they shatter – the burst into a million fine pieces and are a total nightmare to clean up. I’m not sure if it’s because of their potassium chloride coating or because they are made to be super thin, my advice is to not drop them. " ... hmm
[23:07:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... actually the video that supposedly illustrates that, seems to just show the glass shattering into ... the usual sort of glass chunks/shards?
[23:08:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apparently it took 5 consecutive drops from kitchen counter height for it to eventually shatter (and even then it doesn't shatter on initial floor contact, but after a bounce!)
[23:08:45] <adiabatic> impressive
[23:08:52] <gwern> yeah, this is no safety glass where one second you have glass and the next second you have a beach shore
[23:09:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[23:09:49] <gwern> a pity he doesn't provide any materials science context about how it compares to contemporary glass. I mean, 'tough glass' is a *huge* fucking market. if you can come up with a truly tough glass, Apple will make you a billionaire
[23:10:17] <gwern> (the nestability is nice, I agree with that part)

[23:12:09] <kuudes> oh, Obormot\Arcturus btw, I have started to entertain a hypothesis that microclots could be a major driver of long covid
[23:12:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Oh? Why do you say?
[23:12:41] <kuudes> I have been looking to on if it would be reasonable for one to take a some days or weeks of aspirin course in order to combat long covid
[23:13:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting, but whence this hypothesis, and what supports it?
[23:13:09] <Filipepe> Obormot\Arcturus: under what context did you develop your color spectrum paper/talk? Are you a philosopher?
[23:13:32] <kuudes> covid, and vaccines seem to be connected to blood clots. there have been some indications that some brain situations and organ situations could be explained with microclots
[23:13:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Filipepe: Studied cognitive science in college. That was an interdisciplinary minor, included philosophy of mind, among a bunch of other things
[23:13:51] <kuudes> I presume the spike protein could match to something where indirect causation causes blood clots
[23:14:06] <Filipepe> cool
[23:14:14] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, but yeah, I don't have anything concrete in this
[23:14:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Filipepe: Ended up writing that, doing a couple of phil. conference talks etc.
[23:15:01] <kuudes> but I would maybe look into how feasible an aspirin course is, as likely that is easier to decide
[23:15:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Hmm, well we do know covid does stuff with blood clotting (I've never recovered feeling in my big toe tips, e.g., nerve damage from clots during initial disease course is my theory) ... and of course the other stuff...
[23:15:28] <kuudes> ie if aspirin course is clearly of minor harm, then it could be feasible to just try a course and see if it improves stuff in oneself
[23:15:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Am a bit skeptical that could all lead to the diversity of long covid symptoms we see, though
[23:15:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah, the question is indeed "what are downsides of this treatment"
[23:16:04] <kuudes> yeah
[23:16:49] <kuudes> presumably scientific evidence for is still some years and IRBs away. but it feels possibly a thing one can do oneself and a thing that could have low cost, so it sounds like a thing to check
[23:16:55] <ggreer> if blood is too thick you risk infarction. if it's too thin you risk hemorrhage
[23:17:16] <kuudes> personally I have started to take aspirin on mornings now during covid time, same as I have switched my ssri to fluvosamin
[23:17:21] <kuudes> ggreer, yes
[23:17:40] <kuudes> hence it is not completely trivial but a thing one should check if it suits oneself
[23:17:59] <kuudes> but for normal working age people usually it could be feasible
[23:19:00] <kuudes> random observations from media have been that bieber woman confirmed on media that she had had microclots on her brain, which caused her to have weird symptoms and could be detected in mri or something
[23:19:22] <saturn2> a little aspirin seems to be overall good for you in general
[23:19:51] <kuudes> at least it seems much less intrusive than lsd ^_^;
[23:21:22] <Filipepe> is this phrase correct: "who here likes adrenaline?"
[23:22:04] <kuudes> sounds correct to me but I am not a native
[23:22:09] <adiabatic> Filipepe: sounds good to me
[23:22:16] <Filipepe> thanks
[23:22:25] <dbohdan[phone]> I've read of a trial of blood thinners for long COVID. But it was not a randomized placebo-controlled trial, and they gave the patients a really serious blood thinner under hospital conditions.
[23:25:19] <kuudes> I started to wonder if it would be useful to just take an aspirin before taking a covid vaccine as well

[23:26:08] <dbohdan[phone]> YW
[23:28:06] <kuudes> if there was a direct causation, then it would be so that the spike protein would work as something re coagulation, and its presence would cause coagulation. it feels to me more natural that it might be indirect causation, where spike protein would look like something causally downstream to some coagulation regulator, and presence would cause white cells to kill areas where there are spike protein or some coagulation regulation prefix, which would 
[23:28:06] <kuudes> increase coagulation, also in places where there was no infection originally
