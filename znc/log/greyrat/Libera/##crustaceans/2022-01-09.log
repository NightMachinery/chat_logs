[00:10:59] <buttsbot> Pennsylvania Turnpike, world's most expensive tollway system, increases tolls 5%
[00:11:08] <manicennui> A report by the Australian insurance company Budget Direct in March listed the Pennsylvania Turnpike as the most expensive toll road in the world, as measured by total cost to traverse the system – $112.91.

[04:44:06] <manicennui> Seems like Quebec figured it out: First-dose vaccinations quadruple in Quebec ahead of restrictions at liquor and cannabis stores
[04:45:22] <manicennui> Thursday, Dubé announced that vaccine passports would be required to enter Société des alcools du Québec (SAQ) and Société québécoise du cannabis (SQDC) locations starting Jan. 18.
[04:52:32] <kline> pretty bonkers that you need special shops for alcohol thoug

[05:00:40] <imode> imma good boy
[05:00:41] <manicennui> Always.
[05:01:35] <bkero> You have to figure that the population has the same level of being able to be trusted as their neighbors, who might have easier access to drugs, alcohol, and guns.
[05:01:45] <bkero> and you can compare them to see what the results would likely be
[05:02:15] <bkero> For example you can only buy liquor at state-run liquor stores in Oregon. In Washington, next door, they allowed liquor to be bought in grocery stores.
[05:02:19] <bkero> Society did not end.
[05:02:26] <imode> simple solution. do not have neighbors.
[05:02:38] <manicennui> bkero: Yeah, but Washington produced MS and Amazon.
[05:02:43] <manicennui> bkero: Clearly they made a mistake.
[05:03:02] <bkero> While that's true, that happened before WA moved away from state-run liquor stores

[06:06:25] <imode> under mandrean's comment.
[06:06:54] <gwozniak> Yeah, I can see it.  I just so happened to have it on my screen at the time (just hadn't read it yet)
[06:07:16] <imode> I am not afraid to be mean to people that are either too proud to admit they've bought into an exploitative scheme or are fully aware of it and participating in it.
[06:07:28] <imode> and I'm not about to change that stance for karma.
[06:07:46] <imode> if that's what people classify as "mean".
[06:08:29] <gwozniak> I think soulcutter's comment is correct: decentralization doesn't really work when it requires everyone at the edge do a lot of work (such as run your own server, or be your own bank)
[06:09:15] <gwozniak> Really, those who want to decentralize things want to decentralize power, and doing that is not done with technological solutions
[06:09:24] <imode> yeah. which is why there's always a proper middleground: the technology needs to be open enough where someone can offer to do that work for you, but your artifacts remain portable between providers.
[06:09:47] <gwozniak> "Web1" and "Web2" were already decentralized.  It didn't pan out.
[06:09:55] <imode> but muh rdf.
[06:10:27] <imode> (I would honestly rather the semweb than anything we're getting out of facebook et. al. right now.)
[06:11:24] <companion_cube> Hey there's at least zstd!

[06:11:54] <imode> gimme some of that zesty D.
[06:12:56] <gwozniak> Comments like "I really, really believe in decentralizing the net" but that don't support "web3" are just as naive as web3
[06:14:56] <gwozniak> I have some stuff about the DWeb that the Internet Archive has been pushing queued up, and I'm guessing it will be way off the mark idealism too
[06:15:27] <imode> either the 20-somethings that are just now coming to grips with all of this new shit don't understand the original web's foundations (tbh I don't think TBL does either) and are trying to keep pace with 'decentralization gud' or are grifters.
[06:16:12] <imode> how many of them do you think recognize the word "hypertext" as just the component of the HTML acronym.
[06:16:18] <imode> instead of a concept.
[06:17:25] <gwozniak> Makes me wish I was still at university lecturing so I could tell them how ridiculous this whole idea is
[06:17:37] <gwozniak> We are such an ahistorical field...
[06:22:13] <imode> we don't have to be. the problem is the bar is so low for experimentation -> production.

[07:28:58] <gwozniak> Yeah. Monumentally wasteful
[07:29:53] <imode> "In addition, fast fashion is responsible for nearly 10 percent of global gas emissions."
[07:29:59] <imode> okay how do we blow these people up.
[07:30:06] <imode> let's start with them.
[07:30:08] <imode> work our way down the list.
[07:30:21] <jlindgren> "...an estimated 92 million tonnes of textile waste is produced every year and that number is expected to sour up to 134 million tonnes by 2030."
[07:30:36] <imode> I'll get the guns. you get the bombs.
[07:30:57] <jlindgren> makes me happy to see that forever 21 has gone out of business here in NE for the most part. my wife always shopped there, but had no idea _this_ is what they were.

[07:33:36] <hoistbypetard> there are some social ills where i can understand why people want the thing that led us there. fast fashion is not one of them.
[07:35:15] <gwozniak> We specifically try to repair things like clothes and furniture rather than buy new stuff, even though it costs as much as new stuff
[07:38:44] <imode> relevant, today someone was asking "anybody want this DS before I just throw it out"

[09:07:22] <Church> In just aging for shit in certain ways
[09:07:25] <Church> I'm*
[09:07:29] <Church> imode: Indeed, why?
[09:07:31] <imode> I'm 26!
[09:07:34] <Church> Heh
[09:07:45] <imode> let's feel old as shit together.
[09:07:58] <Church> My knees hurt, my back hurts and my right thigh hurts. Fucking blows.
[09:08:07] <Church> At least I'll be naturally white haired when I'm young
[09:08:14] <Church> Can pull off Gandalf easier
[09:08:20] <imode> I'll trade the knee pain for bowel problems.
[09:08:33] <Church> Fair
[09:08:45] <drakonis> i'm 28 and i still dont have a cool paying job
[09:08:48] <drakonis> feels bad, man.
[09:08:56] <imode> can I interest you in moderate mental illness for the whitening hair.
[09:09:46] <imode> if you wanna include the thigh pain I'll take it too, no extra cost.
[09:09:53] <drakonis> mental illness...
[09:09:54] <Church> drakonis: I'd offer to reach out for referrals but I think we only have senior positions left :/
[09:10:00] <Church> And I don't think we hire in SA
[09:10:04] <drakonis> i'm probably too inept to get the job tho
[09:10:11] <drakonis> not hireable enough yet
[09:10:16] <Church> I mean, in employed
[09:10:18] <Church> I'm*
[09:10:25] <imode> you're never too inept.
[09:10:37] <Church> Unless you're imode
[09:10:42] <Church> :p
[09:11:03] <imode> I'm the water line for how inept you can be and still remain employed.
[09:11:10] <imode> if I'm here you can surpass me.
[09:11:55] <drakonis> i'm almost done with uni
[09:11:58] <drakonis> one more semester to go
[09:11:58] <Church> I'd argue I am but fair enough
[09:12:00] <Church> Nice
[09:12:07] <Church> I still need to finish my degree
[09:12:28] <manicennui> imode: I don't think you know how low the bottom is until you work in US healthcare IT/software.
[09:12:37] <imode> done it.
[09:12:41] <Church> Heh
[09:12:41] <imode> legal, too.
[09:12:49] <imode> the bottom is very low.
[09:12:52] <Church> I'm so glad I luckily skipped a ton of steps
[09:13:03] <imode> I just stepped on the gas.
[09:13:07] <manicennui> I worked with people in healthcare software who wouldn't be able to pass the fizzbuzz test.
[09:13:16] <drakonis> lmao welp
[09:13:28] <Church> I find it funny I couldn't get a tier 1 tech support gig 5~ years ago but I landed an entry level "DevOps" role via irc
[09:13:41] <imode> you lucky motherfucker!
[09:13:48] <Church> I got soooo lucky
[09:14:15] <manicennui> My friend was doing QA work with me at the healthcare software company and got a job at Mozilla through IRC.
[09:14:25] <drakonis> it really sucks that living in SA makes it so hard to land a job
[09:14:30] <Church> Admittedly I made $18/hr for 20hr a week on contract and still had to work retail but I was able to parlay that into my current job eventually with the exp I had.
[09:14:31] <imode> they doin' okay these days, manicennui?
[09:14:36] <manicennui> drakonis: Which country in particular.
[09:14:37] <Church> So I'd say it worked out okay.
[09:14:52] <manicennui> imode: He left Mozilla for another company and made way more.
[09:15:02] <manicennui> Has been doing remote work for like a decade now.
[09:15:14] <Church> Probably also helped I semi-obsessively played with infra stuff in my off time as well heh
[09:15:29] <imode> I went from making $0/hr to making $60/hr/job (technician) to making $7.50/hr to making $8.50/hr to making $17.50/hr to now making roughly $80/hr.
[09:16:08] <imode> oh, wait, missing a step between the last two. $13.50/hr.
[09:18:23] <Church> Oh huh lol
[09:18:35] <imode> drakonis: at some point you'll hit a point in your life where you don't believe you can do anything. and then something will happen that requires you to believe you can do the thing you need to do to survive/thrive. you'll power up DBZ style and go get a well-paying job.
[09:18:44] <Church> I didn't realize how long two of our recent backend hires were on radar.
[09:18:47] <drakonis> hah
[09:18:50] <drakonis> i would hope so
[09:18:54] <imode> 's what I did.
[09:18:59] <drakonis> i need this
[09:19:14] <imode> believe in yourself.
[09:19:18] <Church> Going through old blog posts from Summer 2020 and I see them both cited for checking over the code for a universal hash function lib we implemented.
[09:19:19] <drakonis> its been a bit difficult with the pandemic
[09:20:11] <manicennui> Just start an onlyfans
[09:20:12] <drakonis> i feel like those two years have been a waste
[09:20:15] <Church> Who are we gonna try to hire next, Colin Percival? Heh
[09:20:22] <Church> That'd be kinda neat admittedly.
[09:20:26] <drakonis> hire colin percival before oxide does
[09:20:35] <manicennui> Isn't he doing tarsnap?
[09:20:39] <Church> Heh I should float that come Monday.
[09:20:41] <Church> He is.
[09:21:02] <Church> But given how many FBSD kernel devs we have working here we should just collect the rest
[09:21:02] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[09:21:07] <imode> drakonis: why do you feel like they've been a waste?
[09:21:10] <manicennui> Colin made my favorite HN comment of all time.
[09:21:19] <Church> The us-east-1 one?
[09:21:28] <manicennui> No.
[09:21:37] <drakonis> imode: because i didnt take advantage of them to really advance myself
[09:21:46] <drakonis> its been a while since i've actually mustered up the courage to do it
[09:21:49] <drakonis> ie: right now
[09:22:11] <imode> the past two years should've been hibernation for a lot of people.

[09:22:17] <manicennui> Find his response in that thread.
[09:22:29] <manicennui> It's at the top it appears.
[09:22:31] <Church> Heh
[09:22:33] <Church> Eyep
[09:23:21] <drakonis> at least i have a goal for common lisp
[09:23:43] <manicennui> drakonis: As much as I like lisps, that is probably not a great way to find employment.
[09:23:45] <imode> drakonis: the important thing to note is that the pandemic made everything roughly 10x harder, especially in the early chaos. free time didn't materialize out of nothing, and didn't come as a plentiful resource.
[09:23:47] <drakonis> i know it isnt
[09:23:51] <drakonis> but its more of a personal project
[09:23:56] <manicennui> Okay.
[09:24:29] <drakonis> i can also make employment for myself idk
[09:24:32] <imode> don't focus on what was the right use of your time, just focus on the fact that you're able to survive and have survived so far.
[09:24:55] <drakonis> i really want to make a guix inspired project with it after picking up the language
[09:24:57] <imode> because if you become disappointed in your performance like a project manager, you'll just make yourself feel worse.
[09:24:57] <dmc> the Fitbit app is proper horseshit
[09:25:02] <drakonis> there are so many things i want to do with it
[09:25:10] <imode> dooo theeeeem
[09:25:15] <imode> fuck what anybody else says.
[09:25:23] <imode> none of the projects I've done would've led to employment.
[09:25:29] <dmc> doesn't let you use the device without making an account and giving them your personal information
[09:25:31] <imode> forth certainly didn't get me into amazon.
[09:25:33] <drakonis> its for my personal growth
[09:25:41] <dmc> then it says the device is always collecting location data
[09:25:48] <dmc> gr8
[09:25:55] <drakonis> also i want to use it for deployment
[09:25:58] <imode> doit.
[09:26:10] <drakonis> basically, i hate how guix still depends on the nix daemon
[09:26:18] <imode> dmc: thanks for reinforcing why I don't buy my 'rents fitbits.
[09:26:20] <dmc> employment with guix?
[09:26:20] <drakonis> also good god guile still has kind of horrid performance
[09:26:24] <drakonis> deployment
[09:26:27] <drakonis> not employment
[09:26:55] <dmc> imode, yeah got this for my father and trying to figure it out for him
[09:26:58] <drakonis> guile still has pretty impressive performance for what amounts to a single person project
[09:27:11] <dmc> I mean he doesn't give a single fuck about data privacy
[09:27:11] <drakonis> andy wingo does all the heavy lifting
[09:27:23] <imode> he might not, but as his steward, you do.
[09:27:23] <dmc> watches a ton of Tiktok even
[09:27:34] <dmc> that battle is already lost
[09:27:41] <imode> heh
[09:27:48] <drakonis> also limited portability kind of sucks really
[09:27:54] <dmc> is this finished updating or what
[09:28:03] <imode> guile is a one person project?
[09:28:04] <imode> damn
[09:28:08] <drakonis> well
[09:28:16] <drakonis> the majority of the backend work is by wingo
[09:28:36] <drakonis> https://www.wingolog.org/
[09:28:36] <buttsbot> wingolog
[09:28:55] <drakonis> it has shitty bus factor
[09:29:13] <dmc> this thing might be too advanced for him
[09:29:25] <dmc> has more features than I expected
[09:29:41] <drakonis> there are other contributors but they don't touch the big compiler stuff
[09:30:42] <drakonis> i wonder if i can find a fresh github mirror to check how many commits wingo has in relation to everyone else
[09:30:51] <dmc> Fitbit Pay o_o
[09:31:15] <imode> google fucked fitbit up dude.
[09:31:43] <drakonis> wingo has the highest count
[09:32:03] <drakonis> at 6088, with the next being at 2208
[09:33:22] <drakonis> marius vollmer hasnt commited to guile since 2006 and he holds the second highest count
[09:34:11] <drakonis> the third committer has commited recently but has a decade long gap

[10:41:16] <dmc> imode, do tell
[10:41:51] <dmc> fucking Fitbit app
[10:42:11] <imode> was walking the dog and I went past a vehicle. a car locked its doors nearby, I half-jumped (it's night and quiet). waited for the dog to do her business. then I cross the street... and see a police officer of some kind approaching me. dog immediately runs up for pets, which she gets, we wish eachother good night and I just keep walking as a car drives off with the cop in it.
[10:42:29] <imode> putting it together as I was walking back, they're probably checking for people breaking into cars.
[10:42:37] <imode> hope they didn't mistake me as one of the suspects.
[10:44:06] <dmc> doggo is a hardened criminal and knows the drill
[10:44:10] <dmc> don't worry
[10:45:28] <imode> weird that they took off when I got there, though.

[10:48:22] <dmc> smart watches are so cool
[10:48:44] <dmc> first time using one
[10:49:07] <Church> Eyep they're nifty
[10:49:19] <dmc> imode, could be a coincidence, could be they're tailing you now
[10:49:21] <Church> Although mine is basically just podcasts/directions and a step counter
[10:49:42] <dmc> this one's a fitness tracker
[10:50:11] <imode> dmc: thank you for the largely asymmetrical potential lmao.
[10:50:19] <dmc> ;p
[11:04:54] <dmc> it has notifications support, so wonder if it could do directions that way
[11:07:51] <dmc> bugger the cheap one only has high heart rate warnings

[11:13:40] <manicennui> Dude is 46
[11:15:59] <manicennui> Deadlift weights are 265.4 / 288 / 306.2 / 328.9 kg
[11:20:45] <dmc> I hate doing deadlifts
[11:20:56] <dmc> hopefully remedy that someday
[11:21:50] <manicennui> I like them. My knees do not.
[11:24:29] <dmc> manicennui, do you scrap them with the barbell
[11:24:32] <dmc> scrape
[11:24:47] <dmc> fuck that
[11:25:56] <manicennui> My knees just don't like bending under weight.
[11:26:04] <manicennui> Everything is painful other than walking.
[11:28:17] <dmc> trying to get back into consistent exercising
[11:28:35] <dmc> previously deadlifts would leave me too winded
[11:29:27] <manicennui> My cardio is not great, but it is not the limiting factor currently.
[11:29:44] <dmc> yeah need to work on that too
[11:30:28] <manicennui> Just need to focus on strengthening various parts of my legs to support my knees.
[11:30:31] <manicennui> And losing weight.
[11:31:19] <dmc> I'm pretty good at watching my weight, though the holidays don't help
[11:31:26] <dmc> my right leg is pretty fucked
[11:32:12] <dmc> I use a food scale for almost every meal
[11:43:23] <Church> I just don't eat
[11:43:27] <Church> The real pro stat
[11:43:35] <Church> One a meal keeps the reaper kinda away
[11:43:39] <Church> One meal a day*
[11:46:10] <letoram>  
[11:47:19] <letoram> hmm, where did the text go - Church, tried going for longer than that? (i.e. intermittent fasting over the one-meal)
[11:49:18] <Church> letoram: Should try that at some point.
[11:50:58] <dmc> pro strat*
[11:51:33] <dmc> fasting isn't for me
[11:52:32] <manicennui> Eat through to the other side.
[11:52:52] <manicennui> Once you hit a ton you'll roll over into thin again.

[20:14:40] <Xe> is it being an asshole to pull out the "you are being inconvenient at best and transphobic at worst" card when dealing with a journalist that is a fuckbag over you politely asking them to correct your name?
[20:15:27] <imode> nope.
[20:15:32] <imode> fuck 'em.
[20:17:34] <gwozniak> Getting your name correct seems like a reasonable request
[20:21:26] <ngoldbaum> i’d cc their editor too
[20:21:42] <indigo> They still don’t want to use Xe??

[21:44:15] <ngoldbaum> there is a naughty banner
[21:44:23] <ngoldbaum> if you are naughty enough you’ll see it
[21:44:27] <imode> bahaha.
[21:44:44] <ngoldbaum> burntsushi got heavily downvoted once, saw it, ragequit the site
[21:45:22] <imode> also, all of that technical description doesn't really address the "microsoft, a software company, is now inserting its own TPM into new SoCs to pair with its OS".
[21:45:52] <imode> the known malicious paranoia driven E^3 software company is now tunneling its way into your processor.
[21:46:02] <cb> again, i've been there done that before (palladium)
[21:46:19] <cb> this just seems like a typical security processor provided to vendors who don't know how to design their own
[21:46:54] <imode> things that are malicious are often disguised as benign.
[21:47:03] <wrl> yep
[21:47:26] <cb> the people who know silcion security & trust i've seen (i.e. mjg, marcan, david) comment this is pretty benign, while people who comment on /. et al get up in arms about nothing
[21:47:31] <wrl> it's not like they would ship a TPM on day 1 that locked out non-windows OSes
[21:47:37] <cb> and they haven't?
[21:47:48] <cb> not like that owuld be popular considering people use TPMs on linux servers
[21:47:57] <cb> or linux on azure...
[21:48:04] <imode> why would they do it on servers. they want to own consumer hardware.
[21:48:31] <wrl> i mean they're shipping their own dev environment for linux at this point
[21:48:41] <wrl> they're happy to have it on servers
[21:48:58] <ngoldbaum> why would they ever do it though?
[21:49:05] <imode> so everybody on earth can't run *nix.
[21:49:08] <cb> esp considering the fucking legal dimension
[21:49:09] <imode> on their own shit.
[21:49:09] <ngoldbaum> no one besides dweebs uses linux on the desktop
[21:49:19] <ngoldbaum> there wouldn’t be any reason to
[21:49:23] <cb> dude desktop linux is not some threat for MS, it's been around for years and shows no signs of ever being one
[21:49:27] <ngoldbaum> also who cares about desktop marketshare anyway
[21:49:30] <wrl> ngoldbaum: i don't know the long play but i still don't trust them
[21:49:33] <ngoldbaum> what is this 1995
[21:49:39] <cb> even then MS doesn't really care about desktop much anymore either
[21:49:46] <imode> nah they care about laptops.
[21:50:06] <cb> secure boot stuff is likely driven by i.e. government concerns for wanting measured boot, and governments might run windows on workstations but they also want to run shit like linux
[21:50:20] <cb> for the purposes of this convo desktop == laptop
[21:50:35] <imode> they are very different in terms of their overall occupation in the product space.
[21:50:49] <imode> laptops are not open architecture and have been headed away from that for quite some time.
[21:50:49] <cb> they're the same thing from the platform perspective here
[21:51:01] <imode> from the software perspective, yes. product perspective, no.
[21:51:04] <cb> just because you can get an ATX mobo doesn't make it different here
[21:51:26] <imode> microsoft might not give a shit about desktops, but who gives a shit about desktops. they're open enough to where you can build your own, swap parts in, do anything you want.
[21:51:31] <imode> but laptops, mobile devices, etc.
[21:51:38] <cb> that doesn't matter much here
[21:51:40] <imode> they aren't even close to that level of standardization.
[21:51:54] <imode> I mean, it does considering microsoft is balls-deep in that market with their laptop/tablet product lines.
[21:51:58] <cb> the boot path is stil identical
[21:52:07] <imode> it won't be for long is what I'm trying to say.
[21:52:09] <cb> you have an ME/PSP then it starts the main CPU (at least in x86 world)
[21:52:26] <cb> i don't see any reason for them to diverge considering to intel/AMD the silicon is mostly a taco bell
[21:52:40] <cb> the pluton stuff is free to include on a desktop part
[21:52:54] <imode> I can see a play where you further restrict mobile devices (not phones) to be unable to run nonfree/non-*nix stuff.
[21:53:00] <imode> i.e "windows only" from the hardware level.
[21:53:10] <cb> why would they do that?
[21:53:19] <imode> because it allows them to sell more shit with windows on it.
[21:53:32] <cb> you buy a laptop and it comes with windows anyways
[21:53:47] <imode> that's changing. and probably not in a way microsoft likes.
[21:53:48] <cb> but even on a surface you can replace it
[21:53:53] <cb> how is it changing?
[21:54:04] <imode> I can buy a laptop without windows?
[21:54:19] <cb> you always could but this was niche
[21:54:24] <imode> not anymore.
[21:54:44] <cb> how is it not? macs and chromebooks aren't really the concern here
[21:55:09] <imode> let me phrase it another way: you have an option of not including an installed version of windows.
[21:55:13] <cb> it's a non-sequiteur
[21:55:19] <cb> yeah, and who the hell buys those?
[21:55:31] <imode> several people considering it's still an option.
[21:55:38] <companion_cube> I think I bought my current lenovo without window
[21:55:38] <cb> and microsoftt doesn't feel threatened by it
[21:55:39] <companion_cube> s
[21:55:54] <imode> who's to say they don't.
[21:55:56] <cb> it's an obscure BTO option likely exercised mostly by enterprises
[21:56:02] <skyl4rk> might need a sampling more generic than ##crustaceans
[21:56:10] <skyl4rk> s/generic/general/
[21:56:17] <manicennui> I bought my Dell without Windows.
[21:56:52] <imode> my point is that the more this malicious company digs its way into your hardware platform the worse it's going to be in the end.
[21:56:53] <manicennui> And it wasn't an obscure option.
[21:57:09] <imode> and any advance towards that should rightfully be met with torches.
[21:57:10] <cb> microsoft has been influencing the x86 platform for over 25 years
[21:57:25] <imode> why are you defending them.
[21:58:21] <wrl> imo i think the play here is something along the lines of what apple is doing with notarisation
[21:58:21] <cb> i could spin that around, but it's not relevant
[21:58:30] <imode> sure, spin it around.
[21:58:38] <wrl> i.e. "we have, one way or another, reviewed all of the software running on this machine"
[21:59:06] <wrl> i don't trust them, but i'm reserving judgement for the time being
[21:59:08] <imode> I advocate caution and skepticism because they have a history. it's kind of hard to argue the opposite when they were literally dragged into court based on "I want to dominate the market".
[21:59:40] <imode> "and will use every conceivable ounce leverage I have to do so"
[21:59:51] <cb> likewise i advocate caution and skepticism toward these claims because of legal issues and precedent of it being a nothingburger
[21:59:56] <manicennui> They are literally adding tons of ads and telemetry to their OS.
[22:00:01] <manicennui> Why would you start trusting them now?
[22:00:11] <cb> large orgs are basically several small orgs
[22:00:12] <imode> and that. I forget how bad the state of windows is.
[22:00:22] <cb> the entities pushing pluton are not the same as the one sputting ads in browsers
[22:00:28] <imode> yeeeeah I don't fuckin' buy that.
[22:00:43] <cb> have you ever seen a fucking large org?
[22:00:44] <cb> i have
[22:00:46] <wrl> cb: yeah but the oversight of both those entities sure isn't doing anything about it
[22:00:47] <imode> that's a common way of spreading around and diffusing responsibility until it fades out of memory.
[22:00:52] <imode> yeah, I work in a large org.
[22:01:03] <imode> and it's still not a thing lmao.
[22:01:14] <imode> in fact I work in an org larger than most of your fucking companies.
[22:01:26] <manicennui> Not my last employer!
[22:01:33] <imode> the U.S government? :P
[22:01:37] <companion_cube> the new world order?
[22:01:43] <manicennui> By number of employees, UHG was larger.
[22:01:50] <imode> heh.
[22:01:52] <imode> fair.
[22:02:06] <manicennui> Maybe not true anymore.
[22:02:06] <cb> i've worked with large orgs and govs as part of consulting
[22:02:12] <cb> so yes i've seen large orgs
[22:02:20] <imode> tell me about these large organs.
[22:02:50] <manicennui> Yeah, at the time I worked at UHG they were bigger, but Amazon is way bigger now.
[22:02:52] <imode> the fact that that's a valid prefix for organizations really makes me wanna start using that now.
[22:02:54] <cb> the one i could tell you the most about is IBM, but the details aren't interesting much as it is several business units competing
[22:03:08] <imode> "hey what organ do you work for".
[22:03:11] <manicennui> I think Amazon is probably the largest employer in the US now.
[22:03:21] <imode> "please show me on the organ chart where you are."
[22:03:21] <skyl4rk> next fanfic?

[22:03:25] <buttsbot> Amazon: Number of Employees 2006-2021 | AMZN | MacroTrends
[22:03:56] <imode> manicennui: we have an "Old Fart" widget on our phonetool that shows us what percentage were hired before we were, and hired after we were.
[22:04:11] <imode> even does regional breakdown.

[22:05:22] <manicennui> So many employees and Amazon can't deliver groceries to me this weekend!
[22:05:51] <imode> the economy of scale had a temporary recession.
[22:06:36] <manicennui> I'm wondering if there is something going on with too many people being sick.
[22:08:27] <manicennui> No reason for people to be freaking out about weather here.
[22:08:30] <manicennui> So I don't get it.
[22:08:38] <manicennui> There have been no times available for a couple of days now.
[22:10:17] <riv> hi
[22:15:23] <ngoldbaum> yeah manicennui lots of people are getting sick right now
[22:17:41] <imode> too many.
[22:20:16] <manicennui> I was promised drone deliveries by now.
[22:20:26] <manicennui> Remember when geeks thought that was going to happen within a year or two?
[22:20:53] <imode> drones were good PR.
[22:20:59] <imode> can confirm we have no intention of doing that.
[22:25:20] <companion_cube> pizza delivery drones :3
[22:25:30] <companion_cube> although it's simpler to do pizza at home, in the end
[22:25:52] <imode> simpler but not convenient.
[22:26:23] <companion_cube> tbh, with pizza delivery, you have the inconvenience of a (brief) social interaction
[22:26:29] <companion_cube> drones would remove that I guess, but otherwise…
[22:27:03] <imode> I can get pizza delivered to my door and the tip gets delivered via the app
[22:27:10] <imode> no need for social interaction.
[22:27:25] <companion_cube> oh right. I've only done delivery in the before time
[22:27:30] <imode> hehe.
[22:27:45] <companion_cube> the last two years have been a *ton* of pickup, not deliveries, for us.
[22:28:15] <manicennui> Delivery is a big part of how I minimize being near other people.
[22:28:30] <imode> same.
[22:28:35] <imode> if I control the space it's easier to sanitize.
[22:28:40] <imode> just drop it by my door.
[22:28:41] <manicennui> And I don't have a car, so it is one of the better options regardless.
[22:48:48] <manicennui> Bad news everyone: https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/06/why-your-zodiac-sign-is-probably-wrong/

[22:51:26] <companion_cube> ugh, the fatal misake
[22:51:28] <companion_cube> mistake*

[23:04:58] <manicennui> https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rzrio0/job_was_described_as_work_from_home_regularly_but/
[23:05:00] <buttsbot> Job was described as work from home regularly but must be able to come in-person as needed. After learning on Day #1 that "as needed" meant ...
[23:05:07] <manicennui> Lot of similar stories in the comments.
[23:05:24] <manicennui> Seems lying about being mostly remote is one of the new scams employers are trying.
[23:05:40] <manicennui> The belief that people must give 2 weeks notice in the US is also LOL
[23:06:26] <imode> was that even a law at some point.
[23:06:31] <imode> who started that.
[23:07:07] <manicennui> I don't think so.
[23:07:24] <manicennui> It is common for companies to claim that they won't consider you for employment in the future if you don't give notice.
[23:07:28] <manicennui> Fair enough.
[23:07:44] <manicennui> But it can't be "at will" from their perspective but require you to give notice.
[23:08:05] <manicennui> I'm glad that people are finally starting to realize that there is no reason at all to respect corporations.
[23:08:42] <manicennui> I like my boss and my job isn't bad, but I know that the company would become very different if we started missing numbers.
[23:09:11] <imode> yeah.
[23:09:17] <imode> it's a welcome shift.
[23:09:32] <manicennui> I've complained to my boss in front of the entire team several times now that they basically cut all perks during the pandemic, and while I know they don't cost a lot, they are basically additional compensation that we have lost.
[23:09:50] <manicennui> We did rather well during the pandemic because our expenses were super low.
[23:09:58] <manicennui> The perks weren't all of that, but they helped.
[23:10:10] <imode> people are raised by "educational" institutions to believe that whoever's in charge of you for the day is effectively your legal guardian. nobody realizes you can just tell them to fuck off and walk away.
[23:10:27] <companion_cube> manicennui: what if your contract specified that?
[23:10:29] <imode> the chain of consequences is much larger than what they've been taught.
[23:10:33] <companion_cube> at will for them, notice for you?
[23:10:43] <imode> then.. have fun terminating the contract?
[23:10:51] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'm not an expert on the law there.
[23:11:09] <manicennui> I wouldn't sign such a contract.
[23:11:12] <imode> it's an employment contract. terms stipulate that "I work for you until this contract's terms no longer apply".
[23:11:23] <manicennui> I'm getting tired of signing non-competes and such that I know they can't enforce.
[23:11:27] <imode> what consequences can be present.
[23:12:07] *** Joins: river (~My_user_n@tilde.team/user/river)
[23:12:20] <manicennui> As much as I'd like a different job, I kind of thing I'll just stay at this place until I find a way to support myself.
[23:12:27] <manicennui> I have plenty of free time at this place.
[23:12:38] <imode> same tbh
[23:12:47] <manicennui> Rather not deal with the possibility of another employer being a nightmare.
[23:13:20] <manicennui> Worst case scenario I stay there for another decade and "retire".
[23:13:45] <manicennui> But hopefully I can find other sources of income in the next few years.
[23:14:43] <manicennui> I definitely won't be doing lending, so there is no chance that my employer will care about the other thing I do.
[23:18:40] <epilys> at least you have a stable job :x I fear the time my freelancing contract ends
[23:18:55] <epilys> it's more stressful than actually working the job
[23:19:54] <manicennui> Do you have a nest egg?
[23:20:17] <epilys> meaning?
[23:20:28] <manicennui> Money put away that you could rely on.
[23:20:43] <epilys> ah sorry (english as second language here)
[23:20:52] <manicennui> I never felt truly comfortable about my position at work until I had enough money put away that I could lose my job and be fine for a long time.
[23:21:05] <epilys> I have "only" 16k and the base salary here is 580~ euros
[23:21:14] <imode> heyy join the club epilys.
[23:21:23] <epilys> imode, are you freelancing too?
[23:21:29] <imode> nope, amazon.
[23:21:35] <imode> but I have $16k. :P
[23:21:38] <epilys> haha
[23:21:43] <epilys> Mine is in euros
[23:21:56] <epilys> so its 18ish?
[23:21:57] <imode> nice, that's $18k USD.
[23:21:57] <epilys> usd
[23:22:30] <epilys> no one will hire me or even respond to my job applications because I don't apply for webdev stuff I guess
[23:22:36] <imode> do backend shit.
[23:23:09] <epilys> I'm doing "systems" but maybe that's a mistake on my part
[23:27:57] <manicennui> The two week notice thing is pretty impressive propaganda though.
[23:31:18] <epilys> why, it's a scam?
[23:33:05] <manicennui> epilys: There is no such requirement in the US.
[23:33:08] <imode> it's a myth that you have to.
[23:33:16] <manicennui> epilys: But many Americans believe that it is.
[23:33:23] <imode> probably spread by word of mouth.
[23:33:28] <manicennui> That it is a requirement.
[23:33:40] <epilys> people don't read their contracts I guess??
[23:33:42] <epilys> wow
[23:34:10] <manicennui> Not really a good way to enforce it with a contract.
[23:34:15] <manicennui> What are they going to do if you break the contract?
[23:34:17] <manicennui> Fire you?
[23:34:26] <manicennui> They aren't going to spend money taking you to court.
[23:34:26] <imode> fine you?
[23:34:51] <manicennui> I don't think I've seen anything in a contract other than perhaps "you will not be eligible for future employment with the company".
[23:35:13] <imode> great. if I'm leaving it will probably because I don't want to come back.
[23:35:45] <manicennui> I think it would be tricky to have such a requirement in a contract without offering some kind of incentive to stay for the two weeks beyond your salary.
[23:36:22] <imode> parting compensation would be nice.
[23:36:23] <manicennui> Might be a thing with union agreements.
[23:36:59] <manicennui> Also kind of shitty if they don't also include that they must give you notice or additional severance if they want to get rid of you.
[23:37:49] <manicennui> Basically it should be a law with protections for both sides (mainly employees) if people really want it to be a thing.
[23:37:53] <manicennui> But employers like the way it is.
[23:38:01] <manicennui> Threats work on many people.
[23:38:41] <manicennui> Until their businesses do poorly or can't find people, and then they want the government to help them.
[23:39:58] <manicennui> Businesspeople pretend like they want no regulation or government involvement, until the "resources" act up.
[23:42:09] <gwozniak> It's funny how when labour starts to demand things, it's somehow "anti-market" even though that's exactly what a market is supposed to be doing
