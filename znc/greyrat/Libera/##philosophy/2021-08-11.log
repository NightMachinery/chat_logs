[08:14:03] <plank> i dont much see the point in personifying death
[08:14:47] <hovercat_> please define your interpretation of personifying
[08:15:12] <plank> how would one "reap wrath" from something that isnt human
[08:15:46] <hovercat_> the longer you live, the more room for the tragedy of your absence

[08:16:54] <hovercat_> some things appear to cheat death, some people pull it off rather remarkably
[08:17:12] <plank> yeah ive had a few close calls myself
[08:18:35] <hovercat_> if the esteem of something persisting results in more good, it only results in more sorrow in their absence. opposite if the persistence beyond what would be assumed as someones ' meant to be passing ' permits more room for cursing of their continued existence
[08:18:41] <hovercat_> either way life is suffering.
[08:19:32] <plank> yeah but how much suffering
[08:19:43] <hovercat_> For some reason that came to mind while I'm delightfully enjoying 5 layer bean dip, peach and mango salsa and dark greens.

[08:21:31] <hovercat_> at the inverse you are not guaranteed to alleviate their suffering and possibly watching someone elses suffering can make you suffer more. It is as almost the universe has mitered out a precise amount of suffering, which no baseline to compare it to properly
[08:22:35] <plank> the only guarantee is that you wont alleviate any suffering if youre dead
[08:23:10] <plank> that last point of yours is specious
[08:23:48] <hovercat_> well I'm sure I could twist the words around but that isn't my point. If your goal is to try and alleviate suffering, it could be said as an axiom you have no hope of doing that while dead.
[08:24:03] <plank> yeah. axioms are useful for logical reasoning
[08:24:29] <plank> necessary, even
[08:26:15] <hovercat_> indeed
[08:27:32] <hovercat_> I feel lucky, to be sitting here right now with such awesome dip, pondering suffering. Quite the good offset for such a downer of a thought train.
[08:28:27] <plank> could be worse

[08:28:55] <ro-bot-o> [url] Homeless encampment grows on Apple property in Silicon Valley | www.mercurynews.com
[08:29:40] <hovercat_> now that saying there is an axiom I always furl an eyebrow at. Anything could always be worse. It is a very minimal effort dismissal comparing the worst of things to a situation that practically allows no possibility of argument.

[13:48:38] <arryana> i've been trying to sort the guest room for the last couple of days, one of my teenagers from the old house may need a place to stay for a bit
[13:51:00] <spruit11> right,  young people should dream,  work,  and shape the contries destiny
[13:51:55] <spruit11> hmm,  this belongs in ##politics.  pardon me
[13:52:09] <spruit11> I hope you have a nice time with the youth
[13:53:44] <pussipupu> we might have a visitor from Helsinki, who is allergic to cats
[13:54:05] <pussipupu> so we're preparing a relatively hair free room
[13:54:30] <pussipupu> sounds like political philosophy to me spruit11 :p
