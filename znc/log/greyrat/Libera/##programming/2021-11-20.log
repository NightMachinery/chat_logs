[00:42:07] <bud> sublime was a great editor when i purchased the license. and i am glad i did.
[00:42:15] <EnchanterTim> According to the security team at DevOps platform JFrog, which discovered this set of malicious libraries, the 11 packages had been downloaded and installed more than 30,000 times before the packages were spotted and reported.

[02:06:03] <CalimeroTeknik> ollie, I dispute "left" and "right" for lists, if you write elements vertically it doesn't even hold, then it's "top" and "bottom"
[02:06:33] <CalimeroTeknik> so "start" and "end", which are semantic instead of visual about one possible syntax, are more adequate
[02:06:59] <CalimeroTeknik> we're not handling a string of text that describes the list, we're handling a list; it has no "left" or "right" but it has a start
[02:07:04] <CalimeroTeknik> (and possibly no end)
[02:07:26] <ollie> I really don't care tbh. Like I said this is just a different in approach. If you find it easier to think of it as start and end then think of it like that. Or just make your own dialect of haskell.
[02:07:37] <CalimeroTeknik> yeah, Haskell people don't care, that's my problem with them
[02:07:45] <pavonia> CalimeroTeknik: The folding direction coresponds to the associativity of a binary operation, so it makes sense to name them left or right folds

[02:29:17] <CalimeroTeknik> (wrt order)
[02:29:54] <ollie> Sort the values in a map? Why would you need to? The order of k-v pairs in a map don't matter.
[02:30:51] <CalimeroTeknik> I mean, when the langage allows to iterate k-v pairs
[02:30:56] <CalimeroTeknik> and allows side effects
[02:31:10] <CalimeroTeknik> that means an order will be chosen for pairs

[02:31:48] <CalimeroTeknik> that doesn't bode well in my mind, because most likely it'll end up being something that depends on the internal representation and might accidentally appear deterministic when it's not guaranteed
[02:32:14] <CalimeroTeknik> golang even shuffles that order so it breaks in tests randomly if you don't actively sort
[02:32:20] <ollie> Well, a map is just a list but uses a hash function to convert keys into indices, so you can always iterate across the underlying list. Alternatively, you can just have a map struct with a (k,v) field that's connected ala linked list.

[03:37:57] <CalimeroTeknik> function types exist, right?

[03:39:47] <[itchyjunk]> cat A is collection of objects f_1, .. , f_n and arrows , so (f_i -> f_j) and similarly B has (g_m -> g_n) then a functor is a map between A and B in the sense (f_i -> f_j) -> (g_m -> g_n)
[03:39:55] <[itchyjunk]> dunno enough lingo to talk about this

[05:57:57] <flakland> octet == byte
[05:57:59] <flakland> tho
[05:58:02] <Gamah> yes.
[05:58:05] <Gamah> and ipv6 is hex
[05:58:10] <Soni> temy: it's gonna break anything that uses the whole /8 for vanity addresses

[05:58:57] <InPhase> temy: Freeing 127/8 sounds like a recipe for disaster for anything trying to use that.  Systems all over are hardcoded to treat that as local.
[05:58:59] <flakland> only thing i can imagine is some crazy half-baked theory that nobody can explain
[05:59:19] <Soni> everyone should use vanity addresses in their software

[05:59:38] <InPhase> (I will confess, I said that a decade ago too about ipv4.)
[05:59:39] <Soni> mostly to get in the way of the IETF
[05:59:41] <Gamah> to remove the need for NAT
[05:59:52] <temy> InPhase: It's like they forgot a lot of devices won't be able to update to treat 127/8 as remote, lol

[06:19:41] <moose> You still have all of the same issues because you end up with a new protocol number, it has to be treated very differently already.

[06:20:19] <flakland> you just need to change a tiny portion of the header
[06:20:22] <moose> Lets use the upper 4 bits of the IPv4 id header field as a version support indicator

[06:54:38] <moose> TMS was not effective enough, it was sad for patients. They didn't consider the effect of treating someone for depression, giving them high expectations, and then leaving them with nothing.
[06:54:43] <moose> After charging them for all of the cash.
[06:54:49] <moose> Like can you imagine how devastating that would be.
[06:54:53] <Hash> *nod*
[06:55:18] <moose> But SAINT is getting a lot of study attention.

[08:22:22] <ProfSimm> They all have components that emit synchronizing impulses, and once they establish a common local "clock rate", they switch to information exchange: impulse is 1, and lack of impulse is 0. Parkinson is a condition where cells lost the ability to sync. Maybe they can't emit strong impulses anymore, or lost the ability to be excited by them. Magnetic materials have multipe domains that

[08:22:28] *** Joins: voices- (~voices_@84.238.197.28)
[08:22:48] <ProfSimm> differently synched. Apply strong magnetic unidirectional field to them, they align, and become magnetised. The universe is not binary. It's unary. Impulse or no impulse. But local time has a stable rate from point to point. So synchronization between points allows you to DOUBLE the symbols you have: 1 and 0. And that's how the whole universe emerges.

[16:58:07] <[itchyjunk]> maybe you indirectly test the helpers
[16:58:09] <Trashlord> another suggestion I read is to test the public function that calls these private functions, and then check for the conditions that have changed
[16:58:11] <[itchyjunk]> via the public methods.

[19:03:44] <[itchyjunk]> is it just gonna be a loop with the constructor being called?
[19:03:57] <Rounin> Ah... var is a reserved keyword now, I believe... Which also represents a type
[19:04:00] <[itchyjunk]> err i guess, do i have to `new constructor()` any time i wanna make a new?
[19:04:14] <[itchyjunk]> well its just pseudocode

[19:21:24] <[itchyjunk]> oh i was trying if ((int) double % 30 == 0) { }
[19:21:26] <bjs> I'd be careful because you might also be very close to 15
[19:21:30] <[itchyjunk]> how does abs help?
[19:21:58] <GeDaMo> Because it may be slightly above or below 0
[19:21:59] <InPhase> Right, it could be just under 15.
[19:22:37] <InPhase> You can use some extra steps like adding 15.0/2, then modulo, then subtracting 15.0/2, then abs, then the epsilon comparison.
[19:22:57] <[itchyjunk]> what does abs do again?
[19:23:03] <GeDaMo> Absolute
[19:23:05] <InPhase> Absolute value
[19:23:11] <user51> GeDaMo: can i see it?
[19:23:18] <GeDaMo> If it's negative, it makes it positive with the same value
[19:23:24] <InPhase> Replace that with whatever language you're in as an operation that will work on floats.

[19:24:28] <[itchyjunk]> im keeping track of how long the game has been running
[19:24:34] <John_Ivan> anyone here know their way around ASTs in bison?
[19:24:36] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: My brain was ahead of the right solution.  Notice the part about adding and subtracting 15.0/2 around the modulo making it negative if it's just below the desired modulo boundary.
[19:24:37] <[itchyjunk]> so it shouldn't be negative
[19:24:43] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: okay, well maybe if the input is positive the output won't be negative either,  but you didn't actually say that :P
[19:24:48] <user51> GeDaMo: ah, ok then.
[19:25:00] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, i did at some point!
[19:25:05] <GeDaMo> user51: what is it you're trying to do?
[19:25:16] <[itchyjunk]> my second problem is that loops seems to not run like it should inside this gui instance
[19:25:21] <user51> just curious to get some perspective
[19:25:31] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: If you want it to strictly fire when it's past the edge, then you don't need the absolute value.  My original interpretation was that you were looking for almost 0 in a float.  If you are looking for 0 or just past 0 then you do differently.
[19:25:51] <[itchyjunk]> right, working with float is too much work
[19:25:56] <[itchyjunk]> i'll cast it to int in this case
[19:26:08] <[itchyjunk]> just need it to "trigger next wave"
[19:26:16] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: If you're dealing with time though you probably don't want any of this logic at all.  This is now an xy problem.  Instead you should store last_frame_time, subtract current time from last_frame_time, and if it's greater than 15 trigger another one.

[22:05:40] <norias> GeDaMo: fair
[22:05:41] <oldlaptop> the classic unix ones are dc, which is one of the oldest unix programs (predating C, it was one of the first applications for the unix B compiler, IIRC), and bc, which originated as a preprocessor for dc
[22:06:10] <oldlaptop> user51: an n-ary operation pops the top n values from the stack, for any value of n
[22:06:15] <zero> GeDaMo: i have at lest 3 repls constantly open as part of my workflow interface
[22:06:20] <pyzozord> bc is posix, dc is not
[22:06:24] <user51> oh, convert it to infix
[22:06:58] <oldlaptop> that is correct, posix chose to standardize bc instead, because infix is more familiar (easier didn't matter to them, I guess)
[22:07:04] <oldlaptop> dc is nonetheless much older
[22:07:26] <pyzozord> oh that's interesting, I didn't know that

[22:07:31] <nomagno> They could have easily standardized both
[22:07:47] <user51> gforth did it right
[22:07:54] <oldlaptop> and in practice tends to be present wherever bc is, because either you have a traditional implementation where bc is a compiler that outputs dc code, or you have gnu where bc and dc are both shells for gmp that tend to be packaged together

[23:15:59] <vdamewood> novns: Yes. Oops.
[23:16:15] <nomagno> zero: the common analogy is Git was meant to be the plumbing for a version control system, but its users liked it too much to bother making an actual fountain with a tap. In any case, I agree it is so technical it shouldn't be used 'unwrapped' EVERYWHERE.

[23:18:49] <vdamewood> Scheme is standardized.
[23:18:53] <apotheon> nomagno: I think you can still get the source for all the major BSD Unix systems via CVS, even for those that started using something else for primary version control.

[23:24:06] <apotheon> I used Subversion in the early noughties, and had occasion to briefly use it again after Apache had controlled Subversion for a while (and stupidly changed the fucking licenses), and discovered that the more recent version was much more difficult, annoying, and counter-productive in some ways.
[23:24:13] <vdamewood> c2a1: OpenBSD folks like specific licenses.

[23:47:08] <apotheon> That changes nothing I said.

[23:48:46] <Guest52> what if you had a +10000% more powerful computer but you did the same stuff you've always done on your PC?
[23:49:55] <apotheon> Guest52: Give it a couple decades, and that might be the case.
[23:49:55] <GeDaMo> You're talking to people using IRC which ran on 80s computers :P
[23:49:55] <flakland> what if you had a nickkname

[23:50:44] <Rounin> VR can still become a thing if they can just standardize the headsets and make them cheaper
[23:51:00] <Guest52> I've afraid VR would hurt my eyes
[23:52:15] <beaky> yes wish my computer was 100x faster i wont have to think about maximizing cache and simd utilization and minimizing ram consumption anymore i can just program using pointers everywhere like in haskell
[23:52:32] <bugweiser> same here :) Mainstream gets updates/fixes some of which are worth while, openbsd is frozen on the last version that they could still tie into openbsd due to growing incompatibilities between bsd direction vs linux direction. Perhaps someday soon I may ask you your tricks to get it to work and let users use it (sshfs) normally ?
[23:52:58] <beaky> nice i like openbsd it is the most open bsd
[23:52:59] <apotheon> Current VR stuff could definitely cause eyestrain and worsening eyesight over time, if you use it too much.
[23:53:27] <Rounin> Joke's on them, my eyesight is already worsening
[23:54:05] <apotheon> Rounin: You can speed it up!
[23:54:11] <Rounin> :D
[23:54:21] <flakland> wellyeah these crazies will strap a phone to their face and call it VR, probably at full brightness
[23:54:33] <apotheon> bugweiser: Given the direction of the Linux world, I'd rather lose fuse than "gain" what Linux is adding.

[23:55:51] <beaky> linux adds systemd a great value add
[23:56:09] <flakland> they added out of band messages to AF_UNIX in their last patch
[23:56:10] <Rounin> I hear that the most expensive headsets work well on Linux, but not the cheaper ones... And then there's BSD, of course. There's also the issue of getting existing GL/D3D games to work with it... You can sort of do somethng to the projection matrix to make it work some of the time, but only if the game doesn't do anything strange. And Unreal Engine 4 supports stero views out of the box
[23:56:13] <flakland> lol!
[23:56:49] <Decker> webvr :)
[23:56:50] <Rounin> Though I don't know if many VR headsets supports UE4's stereo views
[23:56:54] <apotheon> c2a1: complexity, reduced privilege separation, and other shit I don't need
