[12:27:56] <osfe> Hi there. I can't find the way to set linux indent style with offset of 2
[12:28:05] <osfe> can you please help me ?
[12:35:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I am no expert on indent styles, but as far as I know Spacemacs indents with offset 2 by default. So maybe you can specify where/when you would like the indent of 2?

[16:46:43] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> is `lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions` supposed to jump to definition instead of showing the definition in a small window? I would expect it to work like `lsp-ui-peek-find-references`

[17:20:38] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> why would there be multiple definitions
[17:37:52] <FromGitter> <dspearson> @lebensterben apologies if the pullreq was low on info. scroll up, and you asked me to open a github issue. I instead just fixed it myself. did not think it needed an explanation, since it is a trivial change and the intent is communicated in the commit title, but I have added additional information on the pullreq.
[17:48:49] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> don't worry. commit message is always required unless it's just fixing typo or unbalanced parentheses.
[17:50:53] <FromGitter> <dspearson> I can reword if required
[17:56:52] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I will add them when I merge the PR
[18:10:15] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> I've no idea, in the languages I use I think it could only happen if lsp is unable to resolve an ambiguity
