[00:00:50] <int0x1C8> btw riff_IRC wtf is snapd
[00:01:14] <riff_IRC> int0x1C8: A horrible abomination created by Canonical.
[00:01:51] <sintax> doesn't snapd install apps and crap now? 
[00:01:58] <riff_IRC> yea
[00:02:03] <int0x1C8> and why do I keep getting alerts that there's partitions on my docker box that have something to do with snapd and they keep saying the disk is full
[00:02:03] <sintax> thought so.
[00:02:27] <riff_IRC> int0x1C8: Snap uses loop filesystems to contain applications.
[00:02:47] <riff_IRC> The filesystem is sized to be just bigger than the application itself.
[00:03:10] <riff_IRC> The best thing you can do is as follows:
[00:03:31] <riff_IRC> systemctl stop snapd && systemctl disable snapd && systemctl mask snapd
[00:03:56] <riff_IRC> then apt remove --purge snap*
[00:04:00] <int0x1C8> Filesystem        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
[00:04:05] <riff_IRC> and then rm -r ~/snap
[00:04:29] <int0x1C8>  /dev/loop1         56M   56M     0 100% /snap/core18/1997
[00:04:42] <riff_IRC> yep, that's snap for ya
[00:04:55] <riff_IRC> not to mention that it so massively clusterf
[00:04:56] <int0x1C8> I used it once. ONCE
[00:05:03] <riff_IRC> not to mention that it so massively clusterf's with fdisk -l
[00:05:08] <int0x1C8> to try out minikube
[00:05:24] <riff_IRC> yeah, stop it and remove it
[00:05:32] <int0x1C8> and it fucked up the docker networks that were already running
[00:06:31] *** Quits: sintax (~sintax@4.4.61.62) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[00:06:38] <int0x1C8> and I have to run all my containers with --network host because attaching a container to a docker network makes it act like it's being reverse proxied
[00:06:47] <int0x1C8> and I can't make it stop doing that
[00:07:59] <grumplestiltzkin> I've only seen a snap thing install once or twice - I know it supposedly includes everything that the app needs to run. If you kill and remove snap after installing a snap application - would the application theoretically still work, or does it use part of snap when running?
[00:08:38] <grumplestiltzkin> 50k foot view here
[00:08:59] <signofzeta> Microsoft has started using snaps for Linux distribution, believe it or not.  they mostly work.
[00:09:16] *** Quits: Bluemedia (~Bluemedia@user/bluemedia) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[00:09:27] <signofzeta> probably the best they'll do until their apps are 100% open source -- that is, not bloody likely
[00:10:07] *** Joins: Bluemedia (~Bluemedia@user/bluemedia)
[00:10:27] <int0x1C8> wait, does snapd run under the user or root?
[00:10:40] <grumplestiltzkin> onenote 2016 needs a linux snap
[00:11:04] <int0x1C8> because I notice there's a ~/snap and a /snap
[00:11:04] <signofzeta> snapd runs as root, but the child processes (snap) run as the user.
[00:11:54] <signofzeta> much like systemd, snaps are both engineering marvels and completely horrifying.
[00:12:07] <int0x1C8> I deleted ~/snap no problem, but I'd have to -f to remove /snap since there's shitloads of .conf, .so, some important looking stuff
[00:12:09] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> from a dev standpoint snaps are good, cause they allow to publish an app once and be sure it works wherever there’s systemd
[00:12:25] <grumplestiltzkin> I mean.. I'm getting around it with a windows VM running locally on KVM, with it maximized, and the vm screen/resolution dynamically changes with the console window - it works almost native-ish-feeling
[00:12:37] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> so like containers and docker, etc...
[00:12:41] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> but… docker is way better than that in the server world
[00:12:52] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> and flatpak is way better in the desktop world
[00:12:58] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> so snaps don’t make sense
[00:13:11] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i mean engineering marvels often lead to reliability issues down the road
[00:13:16] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> just like with cars
[00:13:44] <signofzeta> or macbook keyboards
[00:13:52] * signofzeta just got his fourth free top case from Apple
[00:13:55] <int0x1C8> I just want to know how to unfuck my docker networks after minikube snap did something
[00:14:33] <int0x1C8> I even completely uninstalled and purged docker from it, full reinstall, and it still proxies
[00:14:36] <grumplestiltzkin> fewer moving parts to get the same job done = more elegant = probably going to last longer, because fewer things to break, probably more secure, because fewer systems to find holes between
[00:14:55] <grumplestiltzkin> etc etc
[00:15:00] <signofzeta> yeah, but how's your init system supposed to manage your clocks and DNS-over-TLS settings? :-P
[00:15:07] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> Int, you f’d up the network adapter bridges?
[00:15:27] <int0x1C8> I don't fucking know, I think it installed something like docker-proxy?
[00:15:42] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> eh purge it

[00:16:47] <int0x1C8> whatever it was it was part of the snap install, so now that I've disabled snapd maybe it'll work

[09:38:24] <xe0n> LOL
[09:38:36] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: i've now gotten to where i don't even use notepad++, i just use vs code... except notepad++ does handle bigger files better (haven't tried vscode in a while, they might have changed)
[09:38:42] <riff-IRC> Start doing diagnostics on the load, and turns out one of the PSUs was metering in a power factor of like .09 or something.
[09:38:47] <xe0n> JollyRgrs ++
[09:38:56] <xe0n> yep i use vscode for most stuff, unless i want to preserve some funky unicode format or something
[09:38:58] <xe0n> then i use np++
[09:38:59] <xe0n> lol

[09:43:28] <riff-IRC> And it also said "ONLINE - LOAD 0.00%", too. Like it was just sitting there, gawking at me.
[09:43:55] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> lol
[09:43:59] <riff-IRC> One haymaker to the top of the cabinet jarred some stuck relays loose and the load was up and running.

[12:25:14] <sd> 10<W​qrld> > We detected the disruption within one minute, then identified and isolated the cause, and disabled the configuration. Within 49 minutes, 95% of our network was operating as normal.

[12:25:15] <sd> 10<W​qrld> How does that even take so long
[12:25:17] <nobyk> the outage has been wayting to happen since an update on their systems, on the 12th of May
[12:25:46] <nobyk> Well they probably didn't know what specific config was causing the problem
[12:25:51] <nobyk> I assume
[12:26:16] <sd> 10<W​qrld> Nevermind, i read that sentence as "we disabled the configuration within one minute"

[12:26:49] <sd> 11<c​evapi> nobyk, they said they were just “updating” CDN
[12:27:06] <nobyk> Wqrld lol
[12:27:28] <Hunterkll> in a cascade failure scenario, the system may be able to correct itself, but it's not instant
[12:27:36] <nobyk> @cevapi it says quote 'software deployment'
[12:27:46] <Hunterkll> if they let the system fix itself once the root cause is resolved, that is probably a far, FAR shorter recovery timeframe than rebooting everything
[12:27:46] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:27:58] <Hunterkll> it's not like it's two boxes in bob's server barn

[12:28:21] <sd> 11<c​evapi> nobyk, well yeah, but it probs wasn’t that honestly, and they don’t wanan go in detail purposely
[12:28:29] <nobyk> It would be so interesting to learn what config change from one customer could domino half the web offline
[12:29:00] <nobyk> Well yes they most likely f-ed up with some bug in that deployment
[12:29:11] <nobyk> They're pretty much owning up to that in the blogpost
[12:29:15] <sd> 10<W​qrld> given that it's a CDN it's probably a variable that just crashes the CDN server which gets synced everywhere

[15:58:23] <aab_> if users are only logging on 9 until 6 for example
[15:58:27] <estranger> exactly.. restarting a server should no service impact

[17:40:19] <fritzwastaken> giggity
[17:40:20] <sintax> teh_f4ll3n: go. show your face. eat and leave. 
[17:40:21] <xe0n> HDR + HFR is niiice
[17:40:31] <sintax> i've been happy with DV. 
[17:40:43] <sintax> looks good on the LG.
[17:40:46] <fritzwastaken> teh_f4ll3n: if everyone has that mentality then no one would go
[17:40:48] <xe0n> yerrr
[17:41:00] <sintax> still haven't set up my atmos yet. 4 more speakers to install. and no clue where i want to put my atmos speakers. :/
[17:41:00] <xe0n> 60fps sports is nice
[17:41:01] <csws> teh_f4ll3n, yeah guy at my old job spent like 100k on cards for mining ethereum
[17:41:02] <csws> just insanity
[17:41:06] <Sousapro> Modern cartoons tend to be badly PC animated messes
[17:41:09] <Sousapro> Because they can
[17:41:11] <JollyRgrs> sintax: you can make a house shake with just 1.0 sound, or 2.0... 5.1 if oyu want... you don't need atmos to make houses shake... that's just how good your amp/speakers are
[17:41:19] <xe0n> ^
[17:41:22] <sintax> JollyRgrs: true.
[17:41:25] <xe0n> and gold plated audio cables
[17:41:27] <xe0n> monster cables
[17:41:28] <sintax> right now it's set at 5.2
[17:41:30] <JollyRgrs> Sousapro: yeah, i think b/c it is so easy to churn and burn cartoons, there's not enough thought put into them anymore
[17:41:30] <xe0n> LOL
[17:41:31] <csws> Sousapro, I heard some cartoons were animated using flash lol
[17:41:38] <JollyRgrs> gotta have gold tips!
[17:41:40] <teh_f4ll3n> fritzwastaken, no one probably will :D
[17:41:41] <fritzwastaken> xe0n: only the best
[17:41:47] <JollyRgrs> csws: only the best
[17:41:49] <sintax> but by the end of the week i'll be 7.2 and then just need to put my atmos upfiring speakers somewhere
[17:41:55] <xe0n> simpsons\family guy\american dad take a few months to turn around
[17:41:58] <xe0n> south park: six days
[17:41:59] <xe0n> lol
[17:41:59] <sintax> then when done 7.2.2
[17:42:21] <JollyRgrs> so what's the extra .2? these "upfiring" speakers?
[17:42:29] <sintax> JollyRgrs: atmos speakers
[17:42:42] <sintax> for atmos surround sound. 
[17:42:52] <xe0n> sintax: have you tried spatial audio with atmos?
[17:42:55] <sintax> one review was if you tilted your head up it sounded like it was raining in the dudes room
[17:43:01] <sintax> xe0n: i have not. 
[17:43:06] <xe0n> suss it out
[17:43:08] <JollyRgrs> ya. i don't have the $ to put into that... i'm still not back to my old 5.1 since i married and had kids
[17:43:10] <Sousapro> Hot take with audio cables: it does matter to some extent that you're using the correct size of conductors in the cable, that they're not some copper clad aluminum nightmare or oxidized out and that you have a decent connector on the end if you're actually pushing some power
[17:43:35] <sintax> i'll check the spatial sound out. 
[17:43:37] <JollyRgrs> it matters if your copper is all statue of liberty green on the inside
[17:43:41] <Sousapro> Yes
[17:43:43] <xe0n> YERRRR
[17:43:48] * csws replaces Sousapro's mains wiring with copper coated aluminium
[17:44:01] <JollyRgrs> lol
[17:44:05] * Sousapro dies in a fire immediately
[17:44:05] <sintax> i'm using 14 guage copper wire i think it is. 
[17:44:08] * sintax shrugs
[17:44:12] <teh_f4ll3n> now, the real question is: Dutch Gold or Foster's? :DDDD
[17:44:16] <xe0n> im layin copper!
[17:44:22] <csws> damn it was that easy
[17:44:26] <xe0n> copper head roooaddddd
[17:44:52] <sintax> ^^
[17:44:55] <Sousapro> sintax: as long as it's not literally green on the inside, you've got a decent connector on it and the connector is soldered on well, you're good 
[17:45:00] <xe0n> im pretty sure the set of townhouses here are using 1 tv atenna lol
[17:45:02] <xe0n> lol
[17:45:20] <sintax> Sousapro: yeah they're not green on the inside. and they seem to be holding up nicely. 
[17:45:27] <Sousapro> Awesome 
[17:45:38] <csws> remember to gold plate your toslink connectors
[17:45:39] <csws> it's really important
[17:45:41] <sintax> for sure. it's my real first surround sound system
[17:45:53] <fritzwastaken> toslink being ...optical??

[17:46:25] <Sousapro> I had to biamp my speakers last year
[17:46:26] <teh_f4ll3n> get them solid 24k gold cables - they the best for 7.2
[17:46:49] <xe0n> $1000 worth of cables for a $20k system doesnt sound so bad
[17:46:50] <xe0n> lol
[17:47:01] <teh_f4ll3n> $1000? lol that's cheap

[23:31:43] <MoonBounce> im so done
[23:31:49] <MoonBounce> fuck microsoft support
[23:33:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> whats wrong MoonBounce?
[23:33:49] <MoonBounce> Nah i just put in a pretty detailed teams issue that im 99% sure is a microsoft issue because i see a thread on reddit about it
[23:34:00] <MoonBounce> the rep asks me retarded shit like
[23:34:12] <MoonBounce> "maybe the user profile is corrupted?"
[23:34:27] <MoonBounce> "have you turned off the wifi on your phone?" (note that this is a notification issue on the desktop pc)
[23:34:49] <jr> the last teams phone issue we had they only asked us to generate and send them logs like 14 times, so that was nice
[23:34:55] <MoonBounce> like fuck this is some common sense shit 
[23:35:07] <MoonBounce> i get they read through a script but ya could at least ask questions that make sense
[23:35:30] <sd_> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> bro you need to learn to sfc before you sysadmin
[23:35:54] <MoonBounce> lul everytime u google a actual issue on microsoft forums and u see that shit
[23:36:03] <MoonBounce> literally trains me to ignore posts from microsoft employees
[23:36:11] <sd_> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> dont even talk to them if you didn't sfc
[23:36:34] <jr> yeah the answer is usually posted down below by some random if an answer actually exists
[23:36:37] <MoonBounce> yep
[23:36:44] <MoonBounce> never seen microsoft help in those threads
[23:36:48] <MoonBounce> always some random
[23:37:25] <jr> and the microsoft person marks their own response as the resolution even though it's not
[23:37:46] <sd_> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> blessed be these random internet dudes with knowledge
[23:40:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> yea
[23:41:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> the base level support folks really are just reading from a script
[23:41:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> ic ic
[23:41:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> whats the teams issue? 
[23:41:52] * AnonymooseReddtr is curious
[23:43:21] <PublicWiFi> anyone here used knowbe4 at work?
[23:43:29] <PublicWiFi> for their phishing stuff
[23:43:30] <MoonBounce> yeah i have
[23:43:37] <MoonBounce> i dont manage it tho
[23:43:42] <PublicWiFi> you happen to remember how long yall used it for?
[23:43:55] <PublicWiFi> they quoted me several years ofc but I think I might just tell them I want 1 year
[23:43:57] <MoonBounce> 3-4 years at least
[23:43:59] <PublicWiFi> hm
[23:44:09] <MoonBounce> why not just continously get it?
[23:44:20] <MoonBounce> ppl will get lazy, turnover, etc
[23:44:22] <jr> we use knowbe4
[23:44:26] <PublicWiFi> yeah you right
[23:44:30] <jr> think we've been using it for at least 5 years or so
[23:44:58] <MoonBounce> if your not sure
[23:45:00] <MoonBounce> just get 1 year 
[23:45:07] <MoonBounce> then extend at renewal for longer if you like it
[23:45:27] <iphone> anyone else hate computers and technology
