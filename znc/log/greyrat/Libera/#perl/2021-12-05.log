[09:35:30] <bluray> haarg: with /usr/bin/perl it's using the system interpreter (5.034000) 
[09:37:17] <bluray> i thought perlbrew would make #!/usr/bin/perl point to the perlbrew's interpreter
[09:40:20] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.231.28)
[09:44:18] <haarg> perlbrew changes PATH, so if you run 'perl' it will use whatever perlbrew has selected
[09:44:31] <haarg> or anything using #!/usr/bin/env perl
[09:48:20] <xenu> shebang is interpreted by your operating system, not by perl
[09:48:39] <xenu> okay, perl looks at it too, but the operating system does it first
[09:49:12] <xenu> any paths there are interpreted literally
[09:52:54] <bluray> I used chmod a+x on my program foo that has the shebang #!/usr/bin/perl then executed ./foo.pl, it runs the system interpreter instead of perlbrew's. But when I invoke perl -e 'print $]' on terminal it shows the perlbrew's interpreter
[10:02:05] <haarg> as expected
[10:02:53] <haarg> when you run ./foo.pl, it follows the shebang.  the shebang is #!/usr/bin/perl.  /usr/bin/perl is system perl.
[10:02:59] <haarg> perlbrew doesn't change any of that
[10:04:18] <haarg> when you run perl, it searches PATH.  perlbrew updates PATH.  so it find the perlbrew perl.
[10:04:35] <haarg> when you run 'perl' i mean
[10:06:47] <bluray> gotcha, thank you very much ;)

[22:08:29] <aquanight> I know you've said transplanting optrees is a terrible idea but now it sorta feels like a challenge. Like obviously I would have to *duplicate* the optree in question.
[22:08:35] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[22:09:26] <Grinnz> for all the fun of threads without concurrency!
[22:09:52] <aquanight> perl doesn't have an equivalent to .NET's reflection emit or Linq expressions to build dynamic code in a structured way (there's string eval yes but that's not very structured)
[22:09:53] <Grinnz> also lexical scope fun
[22:10:09] <aquanight> lexical scope is probably the easiest part
[22:11:03] <LeoNerd> aquanight: It might not be too bad until you encounter an OP_CUSTOM. Then it will become impossible
[22:11:15] <LeoNerd> I.e. it won't compose nicely with other modules
[22:11:16] <aquanight> what's bad about OP_CUSTOM?
[22:11:33] <aquanight> other than the obvious fact that I would know nothing about what it does or how it interacts with the containing CV
[22:11:36] <LeoNerd> All the existing core perl ops are defined by perl, and so you'll be able to work out how to dup them
[22:11:43] <LeoNerd> Exactly. That is the problem
[22:11:52] <LeoNerd> You can't in general know how to dup it
[22:12:27] <aquanight> hmm. So inlining would have to reject OP_CUSTOM. I think I'd also have to do something about recursive calls.
[22:12:41] *** Joins: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa)
[22:12:55] <LeoNerd> Yup. Which means you can't inline any sub containing try/catch, or match/case, or async/await
[22:12:56] <aquanight> the obvious solution being to only inline one level deep. If it recurses on itself, it gets to be a normal sub call.
[22:13:07] <LeoNerd> Which would make me sad
[22:13:09] <aquanight> isn't try/catch just turned into eval?
[22:13:12] <Grinnz> and caller scope and @_ and return
[22:13:29] <aquanight> @_ is easy
[22:13:36] <Grinnz> is it?
[22:13:39] <LeoNerd> Oh.. yeah. You'll have to wait until `no snails` and then only permit inlining of signatured subs ;)
[22:13:42] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:13:44] <aquanight> local @_ = <argument expressions>; done
[22:13:52] <Grinnz> doubt it
[22:14:03] <aquanight> it'd probably be a bit more complex to properly set up aliasing
[22:14:22] <Grinnz> also because @_s elements don't exist
[22:14:22] <LeoNerd> I think by the time you've done /that/ you've lost half the speedup gained by inlining the thing anyway
[22:14:27] <LeoNerd> Don't forget how terrible snail is
[22:14:52] <aquanight> is it really that much worse than sub thing (@args) ?
[22:15:08] <aquanight> in a hypothetical nosnail scenario?
[22:15:19] <Grinnz> yes, that's a normal variable
[22:15:57] <aquanight> I was always of the impression that outside of not having AvREAL (which I think just means its elements aren't refcounted) that @_ was not that different from a normal array
[22:16:02] <aquanight> I mean shift and shit work on it.
[22:16:23] <LeoNerd> It's a normal array
[22:16:34] <LeoNerd> setting it up and tearing it down over function call boundaries, is the bit that takes the time

[22:16:54] <aquanight> and local @_ = stuff; is basically that exact process perlified
[22:16:56] <Grinnz> it doesn't refcnt its elements
[22:17:01] <LeoNerd> Not a /huge/ amount of time, but it's a noticable fraction of the entire pp_entersub overhead

[22:18:13] <pragma-> I do wish sub calls were faster or optimized out where possible. A few years ago I was working through this book "Higher Order Perl" and really enjoying the things I was learning. But then when I went to apply higher order functions in a real-world scenario, everything was so incredibly slow that I had to abandon nearly everything I learned and write things more imperatively.
[22:18:54] <Grinnz> Sub::Quote might be useful
[22:19:05] <Grinnz> you just have to write it as a string to start with
[22:19:11] <aquanight> when considering the fact that I'm not sure anything about @_ setup/teardown is anything special
[22:19:21] <aquanight> I'm really wondering what are we expecting to gain from signatures/nosnail
[22:19:31] <Grinnz> and for above reasons you have to not use @_ and return and stuff
[22:19:51] <aquanight> I suppose the theory that signature variables could be directly mapped to the stack
[22:20:50] <aquanight> kinda like how in XS you can use ST(1) and shit
[22:21:00] <Grinnz> well for no snail, the motivation is to remove the unnecessary performance hit when people don't use snail
[22:21:08] <aquanight> right
[22:21:29] <aquanight> but what I'm wondering is ... where this performance hit?
[22:21:55] <Grinnz> and people don't use snail when signatures are available most of the time because it's weird to people who haven't been writing perl for decades
[22:22:02] <aquanight> because if you transfer the arguments into lexical variables as signature does, all nosnail ends up doing is bringing us back to about where we'd be if we just used $_[3] all the time

[22:22:35] <aquanight> oh sure
[22:22:37] <aquanight> it's a double-copy
[22:23:38] <aquanight> I suppose if I were inlining a sub with a signature I could skip @_ as well

[22:24:36] <aquanight> we need a control statement we can use in 'do' that acts like 'return'

[22:27:28] <aquanight> ... not gonna lie for the longest time I thought return was just for subs and maybe do FILE (since that's related to require)
[22:27:34] <ilmari> the eval itself returns the value given to `return` in the string, and the sub implicitly returns the value of that, since it's the last tatement
