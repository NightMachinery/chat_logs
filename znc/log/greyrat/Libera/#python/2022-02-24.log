[01:03:06] <SnoopJ> phox, they were asking for guidance about where to put newlines, yesterday, although it seems like they want to *write* such a guideline more than anything.
[01:03:32] <phox> I'm confused.  The guidance is pretty inflexible, this isn't quite a C-like language
[01:03:42] <blei> do you have a link
[01:04:02] <SnoopJ> phox, eh? You can put an arbitrary number of newlines between `if/else` and the block they enclose

[01:04:29] <phox> SnoopJ: oh, I interpreted it as newline not blank line

[01:04:35] <phox> rather, vs blank line

[01:05:26] <phox> (foo() ; bar() ; baz())
[01:05:35] <blei> dnl for increased legibility. i'm thinking having two essentially unrelated lines of code, each potentially complex, immediately juxtaposed, could be advised against
[01:05:36] <jinsun> eh one line things, assume manadatory there too
[01:05:43] <SnoopJ> blei, what is "dnl?"
[01:05:46] <blei> double newline
[01:06:19] <phox> stylistically oyu want things that belong together, together, so the other blank lines are meaningful

[01:12:18] <phox> it's kind of up to you what a logical section is.  I definitely use singles and doubles within functions, often, to provide 2 levels of delineation...
[01:12:18] <blei> you could consider the if line, and the line that follows it, to be unrelated one-liners (in the case that they are quite unrelated)

[01:13:42] <sveinse> Does the style guides, e.g. pep8, have any opinion about writing class methods that just act as proxies, e.g.  def get_value(self):  return self.value ? I know its preferred in c++, but I would guess that direct access to the attr is more common in py? Possibly via an getter/setter/property if needed.
[01:13:45] <blei> yes but if each line is complex, and operate on different domains, it would be difficult to read them. it seems to be advised to separate them

[01:15:18] <jinsun> sveinse: yes in python just directly access the attribute
[01:15:46] <blei> i'm literally saying that what I just read seems to literally advise that you separate them
[01:15:57] <phox> sveinse: outside of python itself that's an implementation question as to whether you are planning to potentially ever do anything other than access the attribute directly.
[01:15:58] <jinsun> sveinse: if you later find out that you needed to add some logic to the attribute access you can convert it to a property
[01:16:20] <phox> it's not really a C++ thing either, it's sound planning for future refactoring if relevant...

[03:12:28] <ztrawhcse> Windows doesn't link to *.dll's the way linux links to shlibs, instead it links to a static "import library" .lib which apparently contains the interfaces which can be picked up from the .dll
[03:13:00] <ztrawhcse> then conveniently the linker doesn't actually create .lib all the time depending on how the crazy dllimport/dllexport dance goes :D
[03:13:20] <SnoopJ> sure, I understand the distinction between the two. I don't understand why our tooling wants to link against Python at all (possibly boost's fault) or why it can't find a library that CMake definitely knows about, though.

[08:17:23] <jinsun> well changing the app part won't help here I think, the function definitions themselves need to change to handle multiple clients, and do something like that that stackoverflow post does
[08:19:24] <jinsun>  or maybe make a ClientPool class or something that wraps all the "real" clients, it would have the methods you need from the clients and just forward to the actual cleints, and then your functions would interact with that pool object instead of the real clients

[12:30:25] <pycode> hello i need to start a new project, until now i always used django for websites but now i have to build APIs for a React project. I heard really cool things about FastAPI so now i wonder if i should give it a try instad of using django. I never touched django reast framework so for this specific task i need to choose between fastapi and django rest framework

[12:31:05] <han-solo> drf maybe fine as well, but i don't have much experience
[12:31:48] <Helle> pycode: FastAPI is probably a good bet, but it is a very slim framework, ie, it doesn't come with a lot of the nuts and bolts Django has itself, so you need to chose those yourself, things like ORM and DB connection handling for it and such

[13:55:50] <stockholm> and new elements are appended on the right side, all the time
[13:56:24] <fakenullie> I see. Generally you have to find a way around that, there's no way to do what you want directly
[13:57:01] <fakenullie> like store a number of items you want to process and increase it when you append to the right
[13:57:10] <fakenullie> up to maxlen

[15:13:37] <sinan> Sorry, busy day here. pyenv gets versions from python.org builds the versions on local. therefore requires python build dependencies.

[15:14:50] <sinan> pyenv is your good old python without any additional syntax. it changes your python path in the active session.
[15:15:33] <sinan> also, pyenv has virtualenv support. so you can have multiple virtualenvs (like virtualenvwrapper) using different python versions and none conflicting with each-other or with the system's own python.

[15:23:08] <sinan> @amagorkon: well this is a bit of how you approach things and can be subjective. Personally, I prefer to set library versions outside the code. But I am a system developer not a data-science. So the conventions and preferences of jupyter or data area might differ. I am totally considering the system itself. and keeping it clean.

[17:11:22] <wyre> exarkun, well, I guess the first one case you mentioned (the 'yum install' one) it's a distribution devs thing ... I mean, they are who have to design a process to treat with python packaging workflow, aren't they? I mean ... they have nothing to do with python or pypi ... 🤔
[17:11:39] <wyre> or setuptools
[17:12:22] <exarkun> wyre: Your assumption that they have nothing to do with python or pypi is flawed.  They are quite involved.

[18:07:20] <CodeMouse92> But for every rule, there is an exception.

Since my usage of the libraries really was pretty basic, it had a low likelihood of update-related regressions and bugs anyway, so it made the most sense to let the other packages sharing the environment be

[19:37:59] <Piraty> hi. can someone hint me a nice design pattern for this problem? say my application can handle different types of archive files (for example: extract archive, show some metadata), which are each implemented by a class, each deriving from an abstract base class to ensure they adhere to the same call semantics. now from the calling point of view, i'd like to hide the "test if it's this kind of archive, test next class" dance in a nice way and rather have that
[19:37:59] <Piraty> decoupled to something else which does the dance and which can be extended if new formats need to be added. question1: would i want to make it return the concrete archive implementation object (like a factory i suppose? or a class-static-method/function just returning the real archive object? and throw ArchiveParseError if 'the dance' failed?). or question2: would i instead want this (adapter? decorator?) class mimic the interface and do the 'test archive format'
[19:37:59] <Piraty>  dance for me and mirror every method to its internal real archive object ? better ideas?

[19:39:14] <stockholm> sorry for asking before googling
[19:39:32] <NoImNotNineVolt> SnoopJ: the goal is to `import foo; foo.foo()` with less repetition of foo :P

[19:39:50] <NoImNotNineVolt> fair enough.
