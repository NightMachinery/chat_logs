[00:09:27] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: you should never use getters/setters.
[00:09:57] <Decker> well.... there's no Complex number type (like bignumber)... that's one application where being able to implement it with natural operators is a nice thing.... another
[00:10:13] <ThePhilgrim> But all tutorials tell me to do underscore variables in classes, and then getters/setters
[00:10:30] <ThePhilgrim> Why, according to you, should they not be used?
[00:10:56] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: it's common for tutorials to be garbage
[00:10:57] <AlbertLast> are getters not used in reduxe and similiar state frameworks?
[00:11:05] <stenno\OK> b> const dist = ({ x1, y1 },{ x2, y2 }) => Math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2,(y2-y1)**2); dist(#{x:2,y:2},#{x:5,y:6})
[00:11:05] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: never use underscores, because that's just "fake private" - it's still 100% public
[00:11:06] <jellobot> (okay) NaN
[00:11:08] <ljharb> AlbertLast: no
[00:11:13] <ljharb> AlbertLast: in some yes but not redux
[00:11:16] <ljharb> AlbertLast: but that doesn't mean they're good
[00:11:17] <Decker> I have this brain-board neural network drag and drop thing... but from a code standpoint, when I impelmented it in C& I could use the various operators of (n1&n2) to result with (n3) that had connections to neuron 1 and 2 and thresholds and synapase settings set for the appropriate behavior so processing the graph later results right
[00:11:19] <stenno\OK> b> const dist = ({ x1, y1 },{ x2, y2 }) => Math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2); dist(#{x:2,y:2},#{x:5,y:6})
[00:11:20] <jellobot> (okay) NaN
[00:11:30] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: getters and setters make your code more confusing and harder to reason about (and slower) all so you can avoid typing `()`
[00:11:48] <ljharb> Decker: you can do that with functions tho.
[00:11:55] <Decker> but mostly it's for abstract math concepts - it is one feature python has over JS - I thought TS implemented it with 2 closed reasonable formatted requests, but no it's not even in typescript
[00:12:03] <ldlework> use a good language like typescript and just mark it private/protected
[00:12:11] <Decker> I can - but it's more elegant (maybe eloquent) to do with operators
[00:12:23] <ljharb> ldlework: JS is a good language, and private/protected in TS have no runtime protection. you shouldn't be doing that in TS either.
[00:12:25] <sheetjs> ljharb: overall it's not skepticism over the public registry but rather a desire not to have to do 2fa or whatever other verification methods are coming
[00:12:25] <stenno\OK> ooh duh
[00:12:36] <ljharb> sheetjs: ? you can't have security without 2fa at a minimum
[00:12:52] <ljharb> sheetjs: you should have been requiring 2fa on packages, and using it on your accounts, for years now. are you telling me you dont?
[00:12:55] <AlbertLast> ljharb: okay maybe i was to genral, but i had redurcers in mind
[00:13:02] <ljharb> AlbertLast: reducers are fine, that's not getters/setters.
[00:13:28] <ljharb> Decker: only if you know what the operators mean tho. and since it's not semantics baked into the language, it's more likely a reader won't.
[00:13:51] <sheetjs> hmm 2fa is a pain
[00:13:58] <Decker> :) I can use vague useless names for functions too
[00:14:21] <Decker> if you're not using the operator in a related context that's just rude :) and yes they have a very limited domain of problems they solve
[00:14:29] <ljharb> sheetjs: it's minor, but it's unavoidable. without 2fa you're screwed
[00:14:30] <ldlework> runtime overhead of checking privacy? just don't let the code reference it in the first place.
[00:14:44] <ljharb> ldlework: JS code doesn't run in isolation, you can never ensure that
[00:14:52] <ljharb> ldlework: you can only (kind of) ensure that your own code doesn't.
[00:15:00] <ljharb> ldlework: and you can't even do that reliably because `ts-ignore` and `any` exist
[00:15:14] <ldlework> plenty of my ts code runs in isolation, in strict mode
[00:15:19] <ljharb> sheetjs: you should really go in and require that on all your packages immediately
[00:15:22] <ljharb> ldlework: that's not what i mean
[00:15:32] <ljharb> ldlework: i mean that there's always JS code you didn't write that's running

[00:16:00] <ljharb> ldlework: browser extensions also
[00:16:00] <ldlework> so assume the conditions that make your point
[00:16:13] <ljharb> ldlework: i'm assuming the conditions that basically all JS operates in
[00:16:18] <ljharb> ldlework: assuming anything else would be absurd
[00:16:28] <ldlework> if the best you can do is prevent your own code from accessing your own private members, then do it

[00:16:50] <ljharb> it's always been possible to keep private things unreachable. and now with class private fields it's even more trivial
[00:17:02] <ljharb> `#foo() {}` there, now you have a 100% unreachable-from-outside private method
[00:17:14] <ljharb> far better than TS's `private` (or that of any other language, in fact)
[00:17:32] <ldlework> again, just prevent your code from accessing it rather than having runtime checks

[00:18:37] <ljharb> yes, we absolutely should
[00:18:42] <ljharb> TS's type system is objectively unsound.
[00:18:43] <ldlework> lolk
[00:18:48] <ljharb> with a sound type system you'd have an argument
[00:18:53] <ljharb> but TS does not have soundness as a goal.
[00:18:57] <ljharb> (it's in the docs and everything)
[00:18:59] <ldlework> you're just attaching to the word 'sound'
[00:19:06] <ljharb> yes, because that has a meaning in type systems.
[00:19:07] <ldlework> as if since ts is not technically sound
[00:19:11] <AlbertLast> ThePhilgrim: i started by using one of the farmus framework and learned by this js and in the sametime the js thinking
[00:19:13] <ldlework> introducing runtime check is sound
[00:19:14] <ldlework> logic
[00:19:25] <ljharb> yes, since TS is not technically sound, runtime checks remain the ONLY way to protect your code.
[00:19:32] <ljharb> that's just how computers work, not sure what else to tell you
[00:19:49] <ldlework> it's a non-sequitur

[00:21:14] <ljharb> i'm not saying (at the moment) not to use TS, i'm saying don't be deluded into thinking it obviates the need for runtime checks, or tests for that matter.
[00:21:32] <ljharb> the TS core team often says the same ^, even.
[00:21:58] <ldlework> i would like to see the link where they recommend using runtime privacy over their language feature
[00:22:06] <pulse> I've been saying we should have C++ for the web for ages :P

[00:22:33] <ljharb> ldlework: it exists, but it'll take me awhile to dig it up
[00:22:50] <ljharb> pulse: an inherently memory-unsafe language wouldn't be better
[00:23:15] <ljharb> ldlework: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html#ecmascript-private-fields "This syntax is built into the JavaScript runtime and can have better guarantees about the isolation of each private field."
[00:23:20] <ljharb> ldlework: turns out it didn't take long

[00:24:33] <ljharb> ldlework: that they didn't go through and put in strong opinions into their docs doesn't change the implication

[00:24:49] <ldlework> of course it is
[00:24:52] <ldlework> because that's the reality
[00:24:52] <ljharb> ldlework: and the overhead is actually negative, because the JS engine can optimize it better.
[00:24:54] <pulse> ljharb, C++ is as safe as the person writing it ;)
[00:25:02] <ljharb> pulse: so, never safe at all, given "humans"?
[00:25:05] <ldlework> optimize it better than simply not referring to the thing?
[00:25:06] <ldlework> lol
[00:25:10] <ldlework> you're in "foregone conclusion" land
[00:25:11] <ljharb> ldlework: no
[00:25:13] <pulse> Well it's safer than JS
[00:25:26] <ljharb> ldlework: the JS engine must always make sure fake-private things are publicly accessible, because the spec mandates it
[00:25:36] <pulse> Think of it like this, if you were to ride a helicopter, would you prefer the systems be written in JS or C++ :P
[00:25:39] <pulse> </light_trolling>
[00:25:40] <ljharb> ldlework: so *actually* private things can be optimized in a LOT more ways, because those optimizations are much less observable.
[00:25:54] <ljharb> pulse: JS, actually. because then it'd stand a chance of getting proper review.
[00:26:12] <ljharb> pulse: but obv those wouldn't be the only two choices.
[00:26:21] <pulse> Seems risky
[00:26:28] <ldlework> what are you even talking about? how does TS's privacy implementation simulatenously undergo erasure and also needs runtime support?
[00:26:42] <ljharb> pulse: given how long openssl had glaring security bugs in C++ - decades - C++ is the riskier choice
[00:26:48] <ljharb> ldlework: what do you mean erasure
[00:26:57] <ldlework> ljharb: it has no runtime manifestation
[00:26:59] <ljharb> ldlework: the part that's erased is the `private` keyword. not the underlying code, which has to remain.
[00:27:00] <ljharb> ldlework: that's false.
[00:27:19] <ldlework> what are the runtime manifestations of marking a field private in TS?
[00:27:22] <ljharb> ldlework: TS mangles identifiers. it doesn't transpile such that private things are hoisted to closured functions (if it did, you'd have a strong argument)
[00:27:24] <ljharb> ldlework: zero
[00:27:28] <ldlework> .......
[00:27:30] <ldlework> "that's false"
[00:27:34] <ljharb> ldlework: because the field is still *mandated by the JS spec* to be public
[00:27:42] <ljharb> ldlework: so it remains as public as if you omitted `privatge`.
[00:27:45] <ljharb> `private`
[00:27:58] <ldlework> of course, because all TS is doing is preventing your code from referring to the name
[00:28:03] <ldlework> that's it
[00:28:06] <ljharb> if TS transpiled `private x` to `#x`, or to a similar hoisted form, then i'd agree with you
[00:28:07] <ldlework> it doesn't need support from the runtime
[00:28:10] <ljharb> ldlework: right. which isn't privacy
[00:28:19] <ldlework> you just said
[00:28:22] <ldlework> rather
[00:28:22] <ljharb> ldlework: and there's still tons of way code in a TS codebase can refer to that private thing
[00:28:24] <ldlework> I just said
[00:28:30] <ldlework> "optimize more than simply not referring to the thing"
[00:28:31] <ljharb> ldlework: dynamically, or with `// @ts-ignore`, or with `any`
[00:28:32] <ldlework> and you said "Yes!"
[00:28:35] <ljharb> ldlework: huh?
[00:28:35] <ldlework> which is nonsense
[00:28:50] <Alexendoo> Why would this.#a be more expensive than this.a?
[00:28:54] <ljharb> ldlework: i said that runtime private things can be, and are, more aggressively optimized by engines than "public things you don't refer to"
[00:29:14] <ljharb> ldlework: the most possible runtime overhead you can have is public things. which all TS's `private` things are.
[00:29:28] <ldlework> ljharb: you just claimed the js runtime can optimize the case where you use runtime privacy more than TS's method of simply not letting you refer to the thing.
[00:29:43] <ldlework> ljharb: that optimization difference is meaningless if the alternative is "the thing is never access anyway"
[00:29:44] <ldlework> holy shit
[00:30:13] <ldlework> you want to add runtime checks everywhere, in the off case someone escapes the typesystem
[00:30:15] <ljharb> ldlework: no, it's not
[00:30:19] <ldlework> and that's somehow more efficient
[00:30:25] <ljharb> ldlework: because the JS spec requires it to exist forever *just in case* something dynamically accesses it
[00:30:28] <ldlework> the whole point was
[00:30:32] <ldlework> you've optimized for correctness
[00:30:36] <ljharb> ldlework: i literally sit in the room with all the browser implementors 6 times a year, and i can assure you i'm right about this

[00:30:50] <ljharb> ldlework: in this case the cost is using `private`. it's cheaper to use class private.

[00:31:01] <ljharb> ldlework: i'm directly quoting the people who write the browser, who know more about this than either of us

It's only showing the first position from the v-for loop that I'm using in the render template. I'm not sure how I can resolve this.

[04:56:34] <dpuerto> good question, seems it's shallow unwrapped when accessed by the template, so I think I have to use their expose method
[04:58:41] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: not sure why you’re white knighting for TS here, I’m not saying build time checks have no value, I’m saying they don’t ever obsolete runtime checks.
[04:59:30] <ljharb> SuperRoach: git hooks are trivial to bypass and can break rebasing. that said, I’d recommend a per-commit check in a pre-push hook instead.
[05:00:02] <Maxdamantus> ljharb: okay, fair enough.
[05:00:03] <spynxic> Looks like it's called destructuring

[05:02:13] <sickdyd> I'm having some trouble with Prisma and generated types. I'm following the docs but I can't figure out how to exclude certain properties from Post -> https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/advanced-type-safety/operating-against-partial-structures-of-model-types#solution
[05:02:21] <spynxic> dpuerto: not certain of the issue you're facing but perhaps reduce the codebase to isolate it better
[05:03:03] <sickdyd> in their example they include the full type for `Post`, but I'd like to exclude some properties

[10:17:49] <acagastya> Hi, I am on a webpage which has <div class="foo"> -- and it has a bunch of other divs and links and images (not directly children node) -- while I could greedily iterate through all the elements to generate an array of all the sources of the <img>, is there a better method to it?
[10:18:20] <acagastya> I am guessing querySelector could be used for something complex as that, but I have never tried it and I am not sure if that will work.
[10:18:28] <ljharb> acagastya: `querySelectorAll`, yes
[10:19:00] <ljharb> acagastya: `Array.from(fooDiv.querySelectorAll('img'), img => img.getAttribute('src'))` or something

[10:21:37] *** Joins: incognito (~relativit@user/incognito)
[10:23:38] <acagastya> But I suspect there is some javascript on the page which is dynamically inserting and removing nodes while scrolling (pinterest) and thereby I am getting just a fraction of the images.  I could use the network tab, but then that is getting out of javascript's context.
[10:24:18] <ljharb> yes, that's also true
[10:24:32] <ljharb> you could try MutationObserver but it's not super reliable to handle stuff like this

[13:20:55] <theskillwithin> when you did it in chrome, you must have spread over a

[13:21:13] <incognito> i want the first one

[13:21:56] <incognito> let msg = _("prompt textarea").value; histo = [...histo,msg];
[13:22:08] <incognito> it spells the string
[13:22:19] <incognito> i saw, that's not what i'm doing
[13:23:10] <incognito> if you know a way to simply avoid the spelling
[13:23:49] <theskillwithin> odd,  behavior like that is usually caused by accidentally spreading over a string,  idk

[18:25:05] <AlbertLast> the history could get big
[18:25:15] <AlbertLast> the history is allready json
[18:25:18] <qswz> or in db
[18:25:29] <theskillwithin> json isn't js
[18:25:35] <AlbertLast> but the data could get big, so i would allow the gc to delete it, when not needed
[18:26:11] <AlbertLast> the data came from an api, so i can get the data again, but it takes process time
[18:26:17] <qswz> compress the data
[18:26:28] <qswz> or keep first 5 rows for ex
[18:27:13] <prussian> I think they fixed the weird literal whitespace thing that json has that string literals did not.
[18:27:17] <qswz> those thing should be done server-side
[18:27:19] <prussian> So idk bro..
[18:27:35] <theskillwithin> cache in redis?
[18:27:50] <prussian> This sounds like some keyed collection thing.
[18:28:00] <prussian> Honestly, you probably want to look into weakmap
[18:28:03] <prussian> Let me know.
[18:28:15] <AlbertLast> hav no chance to do stuff on server side
[18:28:23] <AlbertLast> yeah i will look into this
[18:28:27] <qswz> why?
[18:28:47] <qswz> you could have an endpoint for history
[18:29:55] <AlbertLast> sutch modern stuff i don't hav
[18:30:59] <theskillwithin> nothing pisses me off more than when something can be done on backend, but they push that work to frontend

[18:33:56] <prussian> Ya... I mean I'd have to really reach to find a great use of weakly holding references in js

[18:34:54] <qswz> he's right, that's XYicky
