[05:42:55] <dokoissho> Hi, thanks - so I installed znc via Homebrew and set it up to connect to Libera. However, I then disconnected from Libera and how can't log back in to my account bc znc is still connected. znc seems to be running but I don't know how to reconnect to it (I hit CTL-C to get out of it but it still seems to be running)
[05:43:45] <dokoissho> I'm getting messages like this: [ !! ] ZNC is already running on this config.
[05:43:45] <dokoissho> [ ** ] Unrecoverable config error.
[05:43:53] <sheep> you should connect your client to whatecer port znc listens on
[05:44:04] <dokoissho> that would be 6697
[05:44:32] <dokoissho> So I no longer connect to (say) Libera directly but to znc?
[05:44:49] <sheep> yes, that's how znc works
[05:45:19] <dokoissho> Right - I'm very new to the bouncer thing so didn't realize this.
[05:46:26] <dokoissho> Is there any way I can disconnect znc from Libera so I can login again without it for now? I tried connecting to the web interface but it isn't working either
[05:47:18] <sheep> you could kill the process from a shell
[05:47:57] <dokoissho> I may have to - nothing is working
[05:48:20] <dokoissho> I tried to load the web admin module but no luck : ❯ /znc LoadMod webadmin
[05:48:21] <dokoissho> zsh: no such file or directory: /znc
[05:48:52] <sheep> that runs in your client not a shell
[05:49:05] <dokoissho> Oh
[05:49:14] <dokoissho> I've been using Textual
[05:52:56] <dokoissho> Do I have to set up a separate server config for znc then?
[05:53:08] <dokoissho> (in Textual)
[05:54:59] <sheep> i would do that
[05:57:42] <dokoissho> I killed the process ok
[05:58:33] <dokoissho> I also have weechat installed so may try connecting through that
[05:59:49] <dokoissho> I see on the faq there's info on config for that

[15:13:48] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Faq
[15:14:28] <MetaNova> if installing isn't an issue you can jump straight to https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#Using_ZNC
[15:15:22] <MetaNova> and if what you're wondering isn't covered there, you may be thinking of a blog post or such, but otherwise, a specific question/specific goal/specific problem is going to help with what advice you should hear
[15:16:26] <MetaNova> anything besides the sane defaults is going to generally be about hardening if you don't have something specific to address
[15:17:19] <MetaNova> I can remind you of a few key things, though

[15:21:06] <MetaNova> use SSL for your listening port, don't use a simple/short password, don't save the conf on volatile/unreliable media, don't give just anyone an account/don't grant any user admin unless you trust them not to delete your user or compromise your system, don't specify a bindhost unless you know what it does and you know you need to, don't specify the ZNC listening port as a default IRC port (6667, 6697) as web browsers will hate you if you try 
[15:21:07] <MetaNova> accessing webadmin, don't run ZNC as root, don't go loading modules or changing variables without knowing what they do first (like enabling "auth only via module" without setting up a client certificate first and locking yourself out)

[18:56:04] <nckx> Seems they never joined.
[18:57:25] <DarthGandalf> nckx: enyc: oh, are you still connected to leenode?
[18:57:30] <DarthGandalf> why?
[18:57:50] <nckx> Nihilistic boredom.
[18:58:51] <nckx> Plus once in a while someone shows up looking for help, unaware of the takeover.
[18:59:19] <nckx> Plus once in a while they are real people and not a troll.
[18:59:46] <nckx> And then we can point them to Libera.
[18:59:48] <nckx> And get bant.
[19:00:57] <Khaytsus> Anyone still on leenode has intentionally recreated an account there, there's very little chance they don't know there was some change.
[19:01:04] <Khaytsus> You can't just ranodmly connect there anymore.
[19:02:14] *** Joins: Chiheb (~LoGiQue@user/logique)
[19:02:21] <MetaNova> if someone is unaware of what transpired, I can easily see them thinking, "wow, okay, to even connect to freenode, I have to register on irc.com now - lame" without much else involved
[19:02:37] <MetaNova> especially an infrequent visitor, or a first-time user
[19:03:00] <Khaytsus> I dunno, seems like that'd raise alarm bells with "this isn't Kansas anymore"
[19:03:32] <MetaNova> the freenode blog did mention its partnership with irc.com a while before
[19:03:40] <nckx> As a literal Kansan I resent your implication that rampant inbreeding == Kansas.
[19:03:55] <MetaNova> if someone went searching, they'd find evidence of it still being freenode territory
[19:03:56] * Khaytsus blinks

[19:05:02] <Khaytsus> smh...
[19:05:04] <MetaNova> oh, I see your angle
[19:05:09] <nckx> _Very_ different territories.
[19:05:52] <nckx> Pretty sure IRC is illegal in Kansas anyway
[19:06:01] <nckx> being ‘the devils protocol’ etc.

[19:11:17] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, helloooo :D do you think I can publish the 2 guide done?
[19:11:37] <nckx> Noisytoot: It's a rounding error, it was supposed to be infinite evil (6666.666666…) but Bob screwed up.
[19:11:46] <nckx> Used an int.
[19:11:48] <nckx> Again.
[19:12:26] <MetaNova> DoctorD90: it's been a long time since I looked at them, but from memory, I think it's fine to "publish" them as they are
[19:12:55] <MetaNova> any improvements from this point can be made whenever they're found
[19:14:03] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, ah ok! I aimed to the  english :D you said you would like to simpplify them so i waited :)
[19:14:26] <DoctorD90> in that case I wil give them a look in next weeks, thanks!
[19:14:40] <MetaNova> I feel there is a good bit of information which most people won't need, and could perhaps even disguise the most-relevant bits at times for the sake of completion, but it's always a give-and-take between accuracy and completeness of information versus likelihood of usefulness
[19:15:35] <MetaNova> as they are I think it's fine for now
[19:15:53] <DoctorD90> yeah.... I got your taste...you are right...I tried to provide a bit of knowledge too, hoping people may understand the issue by them self without asking 99% the same questions :P
[19:16:26] <DoctorD90> perfect! I will publish them in next weeks cause also other pages has to be updated to apply the correct redirects
[19:16:31] <DoctorD90> I will do :) Thanks!
[19:16:40] <Noisytoot> <nckx> Noisytoot: It's a rounding error, it was supposed to be infinite evil (6666.666666…) but Bob screwed up.
[19:16:44] <Noisytoot> What are you responding to?
[19:16:48] <Noisytoot> I didn't say anything.
[19:17:10] <MetaNova> probably a mistab
[19:17:25] <MetaNova> they were responding to me, I think
[19:21:03] <nckx> Yes I was.
[19:21:33] <nckx> Typotab.
[19:21:35] <nckx> But I'm glad you saw it too.
[19:22:29] <DarthGandalf> Noisytoot: 6666.666666… is not infinite
[19:22:34] * DarthGandalf sighs
[19:22:39] <DarthGandalf> nckx: ^
[19:25:04] <MetaNova> DarthGandalf: but what if the calculation is 100000/15?
[19:26:13] <MetaNova> fairly certain that has a decimal equivalent of 6666.6
[19:26:37] <enyc> nckx: oh yes sorry muddled up names ;/
[19:26:41] <enyc> euregh
[19:27:10] <nckx> So did I just now.  It's an epidemic.
[19:28:06] <nckx> DarthGandalf: I'm going to sigh too.  I think that's quite fair.
[19:28:49] <nckx> ‘An infinite number of sixes’ was quite clearly implied.
[19:29:27] <nckx> But enjoy your ‘maths’ and ‘facts’, see where they lead you.
[19:29:28] <MetaNova> this just goes to show, expanded fractions are the only way to not be misunderstood
[19:29:33] <MetaNova> >.>
[19:33:52] <nckx> I feel like decimals should just be outlawed.  π == 3 and all that.  What we lose in accuracy, we'll gain in lack of accuracy.
[19:34:12] <MetaNova> think of the computational savings involve
[19:34:28] <nckx> Yeah.
[19:34:37] <DarthGandalf> nckx: my sigh was for a different reason
[19:34:37] <MetaNova> nothing would work, but it would be SUPER FAST
[19:35:02] <nckx> DarthGandalf: Ah.  I see.  Oh god, it's a pandemic.
[19:35:41] <nckx> MetaNova: -freally-fast-math -Wyolo.
[19:36:21] <DarthGandalf> MetaNova: I never saw the 6 syntax for that
[19:36:25] <DarthGandalf> is it common?
[19:36:38] <DarthGandalf> in my school it was written as 6666.(6)
[19:36:49] <MetaNova> the repeating-decimal notation is a line above the digits which repeat, or put into parenthesis
[19:37:01] <MetaNova> but since I can't write a line above I wrote one underneath
[19:37:13] <DarthGandalf> I see
[19:38:05] <DarthGandalf> then you can hope for monospace font, and do this:
[19:38:06] <DarthGandalf> _
[19:38:07] <DarthGandalf> 6
[19:39:04] <DarthGandalf> nckx: wasn't there some state which made it 3?
[19:39:10] <nckx> I think the first thing I did after installing Gentoo as a kid was recompile the world with -O3 -ffast-math.
[19:39:13] <nckx> I didn't use Gentoo for long though, it's a really unstable distro.
[19:39:36] <DarthGandalf> works great for me, but I don't use -O3 -ffast-math ofc
[19:40:15] <nckx> DarthGandalf: That's what I was told long ago.
[19:40:44] <nckx> I feel like 10 years ago I could've just Web searched ‘pi 3’ and got immediate relevant answers.  Now it's all shitty ARM boards.
[19:40:55] <nckx> ‘Indiana Pi Bill’.

[19:42:50] <nckx> worse?
[19:43:21] <nckx> Why round up?

[19:44:46] <nckx> …yeah, the reason is actually more interesting.
[19:45:06] <nckx> ‘Cecil had heard this story too, only the state in question was Kansas’  >:(
[19:45:38] <MetaNova> as I was typing out that I had heard it was Louisiana, I decided to find a source, and discovered that was but one of many versions
