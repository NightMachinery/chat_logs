[05:51:57] <jetchisel> !$@
[05:51:58] <greybot> The difference between $@ and $*: "$@" (quoted) expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ... while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c..." where c is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@". The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}" or "${array[*]}". Unquoted $* and $@ are undefined; DO NOT use.
[05:52:43] <jetchisel> add an echo before the cp,
[05:52:47] <jetchisel> -exec sh -c 'echo cp -- "$@" /destination' _ {} +

[06:45:38] <bae> OK. so create /home/<username>/bin, add that to my PATH, then put personal scripts in there.
[06:46:38] <emanuele6> it doesn't have to be named /bin, but that how it is usually done
[06:46:59] <bae> emanuele6: Ok. Makes sense.
[06:47:07] <mcint> yes, that's the idea. i tuck mine in a hidden directory ~/.config/bin ... /home/<user>/.config/bin (or my OS's user page)
[06:47:17] <e36freak> if you want anything in it to take precedence over an existing command with the same name, put it in the front of PATH. if you don't, put it at the end
[06:47:23] <mcint> user equivalent*
[06:48:10] <bae> e36freak: OK. makes sense.

[07:33:18] <emanuele6> you are always going to do a single successful ping, so adding `sleep 1' is basically the same as using `-w3'
[07:34:06] <emanuele6> and you have option injection problems: `ping $name -c1 -w2 &>/dev/null' -> `ping -c1 -w2 &>/dev/null -- "$name"'

[14:06:52] <redgloboli> hi, maybe a stupid question as im new to bash scripting, but is it possible to have a variable DISK=$(virsh domblklist vm-TEST | grep raw) which outputs something like sda sdb vda and use this output as input for a command like virsh snapshot --diskspec sda,... --diskspec sdb,... --diskspec vda,...? where the ouutput of the first command should get filled in as sda,sdb,vda. also there could be 2 outputs
[14:06:58] <redgloboli> or, let's say up to 7.

[14:17:33] <Soliton> the while read loop reads each line of output from virsh and adds to the opts array. after the loop you can use the opts array to call whatever. since this is in a pipeline you need to extend the subshell until you use the opts array since after the pipeline (and its subshells) terminates it's gone.

[16:12:44] <geirha> map(f) expects an array and does f on each element of that array.  select(x) either returns the element if x is true, else it returns empty which means it will not be included further. Then you just call .uri on that returned non-empty element

[16:14:16] <Payam> yes but you called .child but you also got other things outside .child
[16:14:58] <geirha> you mean the first one?  .child |= map(select(.folder).uri)

[19:36:45] <Soliton> of course.
[19:36:57] <Soliton> not every command is a shell script for one.
[19:37:09] <johnjay> ok. i guess the assumptions of bash are sufficiently alien to me i need to read the wooledge guide
[19:37:12] <Soliton> certainly not one that is called program.exe.
[19:37:19] <johnjay> right now i'm using zsh. fortunately it has PATH at least
[19:37:35] <johnjay> but i have access to bash if i type 'bash' ret at the prompt
[19:37:54] <johnjay> the shebang on macos is apparently... #!/usr/bin/env bash
[19:38:13] <Soliton> sourcing is a posix feature. surely zsh has it too. (even if it's not posix)
[19:38:37] <Soliton> but portably you'd use . not source as the command.
[19:38:49] <johnjay> yeah i was just reading a tutorial that said by the way type 'source .mynewprofile <RET>'

[19:39:09] <greybot> ''. scriptname'' (or ''source scriptname'', which is not portable) reads and executes the commands from scriptname in the current shell, as opposed to a separate instance of the shell. If scriptname does not contain a slash (/), it will be searched for in $PATH.
[19:39:11] <johnjay> portable in context meaning like for zsh or tch right?
[19:39:29] <phy1729> but if you source you have to deal with the idiosyncracies of the running shell rather than specifying the shell the script works with in the shebang
[19:39:59] <Soliton> portable often refers to what's specified by posix.
[19:40:14] <Soliton> or just what a lot of systems support.
[19:40:19] <johnjay> ok
[19:40:29] <johnjay> in normal english it means the latter

[23:00:35] <ljharb> Soliton: that is how the pull_request event works by default with the checkout action, which i need to run the build step
[23:00:46] <ljharb> phy1729: that's not actually possible to enforce on non-new-contributors

[23:01:15] <geirha> git can tell you if the build script(s) has been modified in the PR though, so perhaps abort and require user intervention/review if they have? (I've never used github actions)

[23:01:36] <geirha> or is it common for PRs to change the build scripts?
[23:01:38] <riff-IRC> hey juhop
[23:01:59] <ljharb> geirha: it's not common, but it's not a check that's easily automateable
[23:02:06] <ljharb> the goal is to be able to run the user code, and then reliably output the PR number to a text file
[23:02:24] <ljharb> (so the build output and text file can be zipped up and sent somewhere)
[23:02:48] <Soliton> that is why you use pull_request_target not pull_request.
