[03:45:56] <merced> questionable, yes, but apparently valid
[03:48:21] <BtbN> What on earth does that even do
[03:50:01] <merced> checks if Config.IsDefault == false
[03:50:04] <merced> basically longhand for

[03:50:26] <merced> lol

[03:54:36] <MaNa2k> lol
[03:54:40] <merced> MaNa2k: better rename your extension method

[03:55:46] <merced> hehe
[03:55:57] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  Is it an extension method as well?
[03:56:21] <MaNa2k> yes i found it on stack i think, basisclly slices up the objects into smaller pieces
[03:57:33] <MaNa2k> so that i get a list of slices of my list
[03:58:00] <merced> mm chunky'
[03:58:24] <MaNa2k> that sounds more like something Fat
[03:58:28] <Nasp> I think ours might be flawed
[03:58:36] <Nasp> Or can't remember if i fixed it
[03:58:44] <Nasp> But you want the size to be the size of chunks right
[03:58:54] <Nasp> And ours at some point gave you x number of chunks insead

[04:05:34] <MaNa2k> mhm

[12:59:18] <Samian> Does this make sense to you guys? "Cache generation occurs the first time --use-persistent-cache is enabled with a given config.  The speedup is observed during subsequent runs."   Is there anything you'd write differently? The "speedup is observed" part sounds a little weird.

[13:07:53] <Cecen> How do you debug memory corruption in a .NET application?
[13:08:07] <canton7> "Subsequent runs will use the cache, and will observe a speed-up" or something?
[13:08:11] <Cecen> There are no third party unmanaged DLLs being loaded, so I'm super lost
[13:08:12] <canton7> Cecen, what are the symptoms?
[13:08:15] <ki9a> in general you don't get memory corruption unless you have unsafe code
[13:08:22] <ki9a> So that would be a safe place to look
[13:08:32] <Cecen> Some servers are occasionally logging random memory instead of a constant string
[13:08:42] <ki9a> ouch
[13:08:58] <canton7> "Constant string" -- literally a 'const string'?
[13:09:27] <Cecen> Literally the log level, it's supposed to be an ERROR/WARN/INFO const string
[13:09:44] <Cecen> Instead it's writing kilobytes of garbage
[13:10:04] <Cecen> Sometimes I can find random strings in the garbage, do .NET memory pages not have guards around them?
[13:10:20] <canton7> I would be suspecting my RAM at that point, I think
[13:10:32] <Cecen> It's an EC2 instance :(
[13:10:37] <Cecen> Oops it just crashed, I guess it finally hit protected memory
[13:11:04] <Nasp> Kill the instance and spin up a new one and see if that fixes it?
[13:11:14] <Nasp> Also does it repreducable and is it the smae instance
[13:11:38] <Cecen> It does, but it comes back after a day or two

[13:41:38] <ki9a> by default yes
[13:41:45] <ki9a> as biberu said you can probably override it somehow.
[13:41:55] <ki9a> they are often feature tied to a framework though

[14:43:54] <canton7> ki9a, It's fine, but just not that powerful
[14:44:08] <canton7> Nasp, we're probably moving to JIRA for ticketing (which has good gitlab integration), and perhaps TeamCity for CI
[14:44:22] <ki9a> gitlab doesn't have everything jira has, especially for stuff like workflows
[14:44:35] <ki9a> which is an advantage AND disadvantage
[14:44:41] <canton7> Yeah, it's just about enough for running a project, but it gets a bit annoying
[14:44:52] <ki9a> I've seen jira setups where people spend more time administrating tasks than doing work
[14:44:53] <canton7> The whole "Mark issue workflow with labels" thing doesn't work very well either
[14:45:03] <canton7> e.g. GitLab itself has set plenty of issues to be both "Closed" and "In Progress"
[14:45:27] <canton7> Yeah, but we have a devops guy for administering things like JIRA: we're big enough that it's worth the overhead
[14:48:24] <ki9a> yeah it's tradeoffs

Is this because in auto-properties the methods are kinda fake, i.e. the "hidden" field is accessed directly using the dot operator, while when they're implemented this hidden
[19:49:45] <cn-j> field isn't initialized and has to be somehow defaulted (which can be done with the implicit constructor), and the dot operator in fact calls those methods?

[20:27:22] <DevJohnC> I've come to the feeling that `interface IMyThing<T> : IMyThing {}` is a bit of a code smell because in most cases `IMyThing` doesn't represent a full contract for the intended use case

[20:50:59] <Diablo-D3> the big and little cores report different cpuid strings, and do not implement the same feature set
[20:51:18] <lz__> there are only very few chips manufacturers, they have 0 interest in not having an infinite shortage
[20:51:20] <Diablo-D3> so any program that enables cpu feature support by cpuid string will segfault when moved to small cores
[20:51:35] <Diablo-D3> they also "implement" avx512, but its off by default; enabling disables small cores.
[20:52:01] <Diablo-D3> and their 5800x-tier basically is head to head, yet a year late, and zen4 is right around the corner
[20:52:30] <Diablo-D3> I hope pat gelsinger can figure it out, but series 12 was too late in dev for him to fix, and series 13 basically is too

[20:53:07] <Diablo-D3> what AMD is now doing is direct copper to copper bonding, no solder, for their cache blobs
[20:53:44] <Diablo-D3> what *Im* interested in is a rumor that future desktop CPUs could have a direct copper to copper bonded HBM2e die on top of the io die
[20:54:00] <Diablo-D3> which obviously isnt in any zen 4, and seeeeems to be not possible for zen 5 either
[20:54:25] <Diablo-D3> but today's 4096 pin hbm2e dies could do it with their existing, soon to be shipping, tech
[20:54:45] <Diablo-D3> which means a conventional desktop, ie 16GB of ram, would require no ram sockets populated
[20:55:05] <JakeSays> bomb: lol soldering?

[20:56:51] <Diablo-D3> also, the other associated rumor is, their interposer for AM4/AM5 is 2 cpu chiplets + io die
[20:57:59] <Diablo-D3> since most will never populate that second slot (ie, 5900x, 5950x; at least half sold were all 5800x, and a chunk were 5600x), an apu-like gpu die (of the same family as rdna3's confirmed arrangement) would be thrown in

[21:00:35] <Diablo-D3> "but I do dev work" is a boring excuse, build a second machine for that like I did
[21:00:40] <lz__> when you have plenty of cores you need plenty of ram with it
[21:00:41] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: then you don't do much with your desktop
[21:00:55] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: technically yes, this is correct
[21:01:07] <Diablo-D3> its because the hard stuff is ran by isolated machines
[21:01:12] <bomb> 16GB can't hold my Hollywood soundtrack strings sample pack
[21:01:23] <Diablo-D3> no gpu in them, no desktop environment, no weird shit fucking up my year long uptimes
[21:01:30] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yeah but in your case
[21:01:32] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: so then your statement should have been kinda useless for your use case.
[21:01:33] <Diablo-D3> its still questionable
[21:01:41] <Diablo-D3> you miiiiiiiiight want threadripper at that point
[21:01:47] <Diablo-D3> and *still* build another desktop.
[21:02:04] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: I don't really believe in singular desktop workstation arrangements anymore
[21:02:07] <bomb> Diablo-D3 sure if you manage to shit RAMs into CPU, disk streaming would provide a comparable performance
[21:02:39] <bomb> I mean, disks into SoC
[21:02:51] <bomb> anyway you got it
[21:02:55] <Diablo-D3> bomb: I mean thats another thing, I can use rather inexpensive SSDs and stream 3-4GB/s consistently
[21:03:13] <Diablo-D3> streaming assets off ssds is becoming easier and easier
[21:03:14] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: so you have multiple desktop workstations?
[21:03:26] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: in my case, single desktop, but also single headless server
[21:03:46] <JakeSays> i have many headless servers
[21:03:47] <Diablo-D3> but for, say, artists or musicians, they'd have a bigger dedicated workstation instead of a headless server
[21:03:56] <DevJohnC> 32GB is the minimum for a coding workstation imo
[21:04:00] <Diablo-D3> a machine who *only* does that, while desktop duties are never ran on it
[21:04:04] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: definitely
[21:04:08] <Diablo-D3> DevJohnC: yeah see I dont see it
[21:04:09] <DevJohnC> I have an m1 mac here that's only 16GB and dev on it is slightly painful
[21:04:13] <Diablo-D3> I code on my latpop, its 8gb
[21:04:21] <bomb> Diablo-D3 depends, I guess. I'm running Linux on a very cheap SSD over SATA
[21:04:25] <Diablo-D3> like, code on it, compiling and all, not outsourcing to the mini-me.
[21:04:33] <lz__> DevJohnC: that's what I have for 4 cores; if I switch to 16 cores the naive approach would be to x4 the ram as well
[21:04:35] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: try developing on chromium with an 8gb laptop.
[21:04:37] <bomb> how would you benchmark those, hdparm?
[21:04:48] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yeah, thats how my miniserver was designed in 2014, thats why it had 2 of them
[21:04:48] <lz__> but maybe I could get away with 64
[21:04:57] <Diablo-D3> gets me 1GB/s, and in 2014, that was fast
[21:05:00] <Diablo-D3> nvme didnt exist yet
[21:05:22] <JakeSays> lz__: i have 64 cores on my office workstation.. it's amazing
[21:05:24] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: yeah, so, I know a chromium dev, they built a headless threadripper for it, has 64GB
[21:05:33] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: doesnt run a desktop because it just slows it down
[21:05:36] <lz__> maybe what I need is my mobo to burn, then I wouldn't have a choice but to upgrade
[21:05:40] <bomb> ah, gparted has a benchmarking tool built-in
[21:05:42] <Diablo-D3> desktop is ran on a dedicated desktop
[21:06:18] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: ok well good for google. they have a fuck ton of money, and a compile farm with thousands of nodes
[21:06:31] <Diablo-D3> lz__: thats what my i7 did, board halts at the end of bios with the final code, where it'd transition into silent intel ME boot, but then never does; wont even transition into the bios setup payload
[21:06:33] <bomb> Diablo-D3 501.1 MB/
[21:06:42] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: not a google employee
[21:06:44] <bomb> slightly better than a spinning rust XD
[21:06:52] <Diablo-D3> bomb: sata limit.

[21:07:30] *** Quits: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:07:31] <Diablo-D3> spinning rust will burst to 550, but cannot consistently do it, especially if fragmented across the disk
[21:07:48] <Diablo-D3> once it runs out of whats in buffer, slows to like 200ish
[21:08:01] <Diablo-D3> throwing more drives at it doesnt fix it if its happy seek fun times
[21:08:36] <Diablo-D3> its why zfs recommendations, for example, recommend smaller arrays in raidz/2/3 operation, not *only* because of rebuild time
[21:08:57] <merced> i wonder if 8gb is even enough to run one chrome tab
[21:09:04] <Diablo-D3> merced: yeah
[21:09:12] <Diablo-D3> my laptop has 8, Im not kind to it, never swaps
[21:09:22] <Diablo-D3> edge has a fuckton of tabs open
[21:09:32] <bomb> Diablo-D3 ah. how fast would it run if it was nVME?
[21:09:48] <bomb> NVMe even
[21:09:53] *** Joins: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva)
[21:10:01] <Diablo-D3> bomb: depends on the nvme; final gen 3.0 ones (avoid phison controllers of any gen), often consistently max 3.0 out
[21:10:23] <bomb> shit that's 6 times faster
[21:10:36] <bomb> I can't believe how silly I am
[21:10:49] <bomb> lz__ your not alone. I bought SATA SSDs when I could buy NVMe ones
[21:10:55] <Diablo-D3> its about 4GB/s
[21:11:10] <Diablo-D3> nvme had just came out when I got mine, and I still went with ssd, it was too expensive for the overhead
[21:11:28] <Diablo-D3> it only inverted in the early 3.0 days, where price/gb started rapidly dropping
[21:11:34] <Diablo-D3> so only like 2-3 years ago
[21:13:37] <Diablo-D3> I ended up putting an adata sx8200 pro 2TB in my workstation; adata is a huge ssd odm, but until recently, their own branded stuff was kind of shit, uncustomized ref boards, but they decided to just start selling the designs they did for odm work, and the sx8200 pro is sold for "gamers" but underneath is some design that was clearly recycled from a light enterprise model
[21:14:14] <bomb> my mobo specs only mentions M.2
[21:14:36] <Diablo-D3> ends up performing identical to the previous winner, the 970 pro, yet the sx8200 pro cost for its 2tb what the 970 pro cost for its 1tb
[21:14:49] <Diablo-D3> bomb: m2 is the socket, nvme is the 3rd layer protocol

[21:16:34] <Diablo-D3> nvme can enumerate drives on pci-e that self host, or via sata or sas (although thats not done), or also has a replacement for iscsi and scsioe and fiber channel
[21:16:44] <bomb> if I continue Java dev, my SSD will wear out pretty quickly anyway. then I can go with an NVMe SSD and see how it performs
[21:16:45] *** X-Scale` is now known as X-Scale
[21:16:51] <Diablo-D3> bomb: doubt it.
[21:17:00] <Diablo-D3> early ssd lifespans were extremely conservatively stated
[21:17:29] <Diablo-D3> my crucial m500s are roughly 10x over their lifespan, extremely low worn out page count.
[21:17:40] <Diablo-D3> they'll die of old age before I write them to death
[21:17:50] <bomb> ah, I'm good to go
[21:18:30] <Diablo-D3> also re 4.0, dont bother
[21:18:33] <DevJohnC> I'd be more worried about your mental health wearing thin from working with Java that long
[21:18:49] <Diablo-D3> the first "true" 4.0 drives just came out, and they're faster, but not *that* much faster
[21:19:18] <bomb> DevJohnC I will find out where you sleep and stab your pillow, I have no mental issues.
[21:19:33] <DevJohnC> very good
[21:19:41] <Diablo-D3> if a 3.0 final gen drive hits 3.5-4GB/s consistently, a 4.0 first true gen hits like 4-4.5 consistently
[21:20:32] <Diablo-D3> but will burst the whole way up if its in cache (thats what all the fake 4.0 drives did, phison slapped a 4.0 phy to their most ballsy 3.0 design; the flash backend cant keep up with 4.0 speeds, but the front end cache is ridiculously OP to drive down latency)
[21:21:01] <bomb> holy shit, that's a 1080p movie into RAM in a second
[21:21:31] <Diablo-D3> phison's design, however, has completely broken latency on time to first access on a newly paged in page
[21:21:48] <Diablo-D3> its obviously they tuned it to look good in benchmarks, but in real life, perform like shit
[21:21:54] <bomb> it's a great time to write a video processing software. you don't have to worry about caching and stuff anymore
[21:22:08] <Diablo-D3> bandwidth is now meaningless numbers, its latency on new page that drives actual io
[21:22:54] <Diablo-D3> sandisk/WD and silicon magic both optimize for that use case alone, and more consistently hit intended perf figures
[21:23:02] <Diablo-D3> bomb: basically.
[21:23:13] <Diablo-D3> and whats really nice is AMD's socket design on plain desktops
[21:23:22] <Diablo-D3> an x4 that is wired directly to the m2.
[21:23:41] <Diablo-D3> no bus contention when the cpu<->socket extender is only a x4 of the same speed
[21:23:45] <bomb> gparted reported 1.31 millis. that's pretty much instant even for a musician
[21:24:26] <Diablo-D3> well, you know the whole ps5 and xsx design stuff, and also directstorage on the PC?
[21:24:33] <Diablo-D3> you "technically" need 4.0 for that, but not because of bw
[21:24:39] <Diablo-D3> to keep edge case latency down
[21:25:00] <Diablo-D3> but no game uses it yet, and console releases on both arent really using it either
[21:25:47] <Diablo-D3> like, UE4 added the path for it on the PS5 to also use their hardware RAD suite decompressor, which certainly helps, but its not some massive fucking win
[21:26:21] <JakeSays> bomb: the fact that you work with java is a mental issue. :p

[21:27:21] <Diablo-D3> how
[21:27:24] <bomb> JakeSays say that again and I will cut my wrists AGAIN. as I explained thoroughly to DevJohnC, I have no mental problems.
[21:27:34] <DevJohnC> the java ecosystem suffers from "linux-ization", too many ways to do the same thing with no cohesion and the versioning is super hard to grok
[21:27:39] <JakeSays> bomb: LOL
[21:29:05] <bomb> DevJohnC an outsider would say the same for C# as well
[21:29:05] <Diablo-D3> String string = new String(bytes,"UTF-8"); byte[] bytes = str.getBytes("UTF-8");
[21:29:07] <jonp> DevJohnC: not sure .NET is per-se "better" there; how many different XML & JSON & … approaches are there?
[21:29:08] <Diablo-D3> or something like that

[21:30:34] <JakeSays> and i have six amazon orders arriving today
[21:30:43] <DevJohnC> fair points; I find whenever I do research about most things in C# they coalesce around a common way to do things though - java just has "pick which date and json token library you want to use with this library and we'll offer no guidance, some only work on very specific java versions, have fun"
