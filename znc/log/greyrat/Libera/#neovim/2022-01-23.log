[01:14:36] <bubbler> With my current understanding, nvim-treesitter is pretty isolated from any systemwide installed tree-sitter executable and/or parser. Am I right in that sense? 
[01:16:42] <sokan> To have neovim start with :set rnu what do I do?
[01:17:26] <bubbler> just wondering because i got aware of that problem just yesterday and using an older commit from 'nvim-treesitter' does not help. My first thought is that the problem comes from outside the 'nvim-treesitter' packages. Does that makes sense?
[01:18:44] <ii14[m]> add it to init.vim
[01:18:49] <ii14[m]> ~/.config/nvim/init.vim if you're on linux
[01:20:21] <sokan> ii14[m]: I only add set number (and below it) set relativenumber ?
[01:20:57] <ii14[m]> yeah, or in one line if you want: `set number relativenumber`

[17:14:39] <wyre> hi guys, why would you say this could be happening? https://bpa.st/AAWQ
[17:15:03] <wyre> when I save the file (with no changes) the newline character at the end of the file is removed 
[17:15:28] <wyre> I've installed the eslint plugin for javascript, but I'd say this was happening me before this 🤔
[17:15:37] *** Quits: thevar1able (~textual@46.39.45.122) (Quit: thevar1able)
[17:16:11] <wyre> maybe these files were written in windows ...
[17:16:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> remove eslint and confirm that?
[17:16:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> something that you've installed is clearing trailing spaces on your behalf
[17:17:30] <wyre> sunjonSenghanBri, nope, I've realized eslint is not installed in my vps and is doing the same than my desktop pc 🤔
[17:18:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> alright. take a look at `fixendofline` setting?
[17:19:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm not familiar with it, but it sounds relevant!

[17:21:39] <wyre> this is just because I've not written/modified this file, so when I save with vim, it fixes it.

[20:41:43] <ooGoop9> lsp related --> I'm struggeling to configure a `root_dir` specific initialization of `sumneko_lua`. For everything under `stdpath'config'` i want to set `runtime_version` to `LuaJit`. Otherwise `runtime version` should be set to `Lua 5.3`. I haven't found any examples after an quite extensive github code search (Does this indicate that only a few vimmers use lua in other contexts?). Currently i try to differentiate between the two cases in the 
[20:41:43] <ooGoop9> `on_attach` handler. May i be lead in the right direction...

[20:47:12] <ooGoop9> mjlbach: thanks for the hint. I already tried it. However i was skeptical because on_new_config doesn't fire on loading/reloading buffers but on_attach does!?
[20:48:52] <mjlbach[m]> on_new_config is per root directory (or parent directory if on a single file)
[20:49:37] <mjlbach[m]> I guess you could update settings on each new buffer via on_attach, seems a bit chaotic though

[21:06:28] <d1rewolf> bookworm: once I have the lsp installed, what do I use to view the structure? or does each implementation provide their own technique? I was under the impression that the lsp was a behind-the-scenes utility that the UI would communicate with

[21:09:31] <mjlbach[m]> there are certain requests (workspace symbols, definition, references) that do what you want
[21:10:08] <d1rewolf> mjlbach[m]: so listing workspace symbols is a built-in concept in nvim?
[21:10:17] <mjlbach[m]> if you want the AST that's not in the protocol, you could use treesitter
