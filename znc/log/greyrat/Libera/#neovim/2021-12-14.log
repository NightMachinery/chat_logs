[00:18:43] <ii14[m]> substitute() function does this for a string you give it

[01:20:10] <mjlbach[m]> Well, it depends
[01:20:16] <mjlbach[m]> Do you want the language server only inside the container?
[01:20:20] <LyndsySimon> Yeah, I see that :)
[01:20:27] <mjlbach[m]> or do you also want to run neovim inside the container?
[01:20:41] <mjlbach[m]> There's https://github.com/lspcontainers/lspcontainers.nvim
[01:20:47] <LyndsySimon> That's all that I *need* right now - the source directory is already mounted in the container as a volume at `/app/src`.
[01:20:51] <mjlbach[m]> and https://github.com/nvim-lsp/try.nvim
[01:20:56] <mjlbach[m]> depending on your answer
[01:21:28] <LyndsySimon> There's also a wiki page in `nvim-lspconfig`, I think, based on a conversation you were invovled in mjlbach.
[01:21:51] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah, it's probably horrifically out of date
[01:22:03] <LyndsySimon> I think so, but it gave me a better understanding of the issue at least.

[01:23:17] <LyndsySimon> Thus far, I'd managed to get the LSP server running in the container and connect to it from nvim on the host. At that point, nvim was sending the absolute path of open buffers to the LSP, which of course weren't found in the container.

[01:23:52] <mjlbach[m]> The easiest solution IMO is to mount HOME into the container via bind mount

[01:24:38] <mjlbach[m]> Yup

[01:26:14] <LyndsySimon> Gotcha. Yeah, I think that would work. I would prefer not to do that because I'm looking for as general a solution as possible. My employer is moving to M1 Macs and I'm trying to clear roadblocks for all of our devs. A minority uses [neo]vim, I think most use VSCode. I'd love a solution that works for everyone. Barring that, I'll end up documenting the workflow for VSCode, PyCharm, and [neo]vim.
[01:26:31] <mjlbach[m]> I see
[01:26:32] <mjlbach[m]> Well
[01:26:42] <mjlbach[m]> You could mount $HOME:$HOME which should universally work :) 
[01:26:46] <mjlbach[m]> * could mount -v $HOME:$HOME which
[01:27:04] <LyndsySimon> Our projects already have Dockerfiles, and changing the path would probably break all kinds of scripts. I suppose I could just symlink it in the container, though...
[01:27:18] <mjlbach[m]> I mean in the lspconfig setup
[01:27:23] <mjlbach[m]> it would be a runtime bindmount
[01:27:33] <mjlbach[m]> (not that you could do it in the dockerfile anyways)
[01:27:36] <LyndsySimon> Ahhh. Interesting.

[11:42:55] <peterstorm[m]> Is there a way to turn on deprecation warnings in nvim?
[11:44:37] <Binx[m]> I'm pretty sure that's up to the plugin you're using
[11:45:54] <peterstorm[m]> Oh ok
[11:48:51] <clason[m]> Neovim itself emits deprecation warnings by default (for releases; things introduced on master can be changed before release without warning), which cannot be turned off.
[11:49:03] <clason[m]> So you need to be a bit more explicit about what you're asking about ;)
[11:51:36] <peterstorm[m]> Roger, yeah it's something about vim.lsp.diagnostics.get_count in 0.7 and it's probably coc.nvim that needs to be updated then
[11:51:50] <clason[m]> yes, that is deprecated
[11:51:55] <clason[m]> (see `:h deprecated`)
[11:51:58] <nvim-bot[m]> Links to referenced help pages:
[11:51:58] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`deprecated`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/deprecated.html#deprecated) in *deprecated.txt*
[11:52:27] <peterstorm[m]> And there's nothing I can do about the warning, but wait for the plugin to be updated?
[11:52:38] <clason[m]> well, you can make a PR to the plugin
[11:52:44] <clason[m]> or change it locally
[11:52:59] <clason[m]> (just `grep` for the offending function name in your plugins directory)
[11:53:09] <peterstorm[m]> Alright, thank you :)
[11:53:19] <clason[m]> but, no, deprecation warnings can not be disabled or suppressed; that would be defeating the point

[14:32:27] <clason[m]> <bloony> "hum.. it doesn't seem to read..." <- no, that doesn't work. you have two methods of loading Lua files:
[14:32:27] <clason[m]> 1. put them under `plugin/` -- then they will be automatically loaded by Neovim during startup, exactly the same as a vimscript file
[14:32:27] <clason[m]> 2. put them under `lua/` -- then you can (and have to) manually load them via `require`.
[14:33:34] <clason[m]> Option 1 is the easiest in my opinion, and you do not need to worry about the filename (that only applies to option 2, since `require` is also how you load plugins themselves).

[22:04:09] <ChrisKipp[m]> like I just created a float and I just want to give it a Normal highlight. So this does exactly what I want, but I don't get why

[22:12:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> yeah, that's what floats default to. Not `Normal`
[22:13:56] <ChrisKipp[m]> so if the hi for the float is `NormalFloat`, how does the winhl `Normal:Normal` change it to normal? The docs made it sound like it's just overriding normal to the new value?
[22:14:19] <ChrisKipp[m]> but if it's not normal to begin with then, this also changes the hi right?
[22:14:29] <clason[m]> Because the "default" override is `Normal:NormalFloat`
[22:14:41] <ChrisKipp[m]> ahhh ok
