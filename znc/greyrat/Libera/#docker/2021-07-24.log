[00:01:10] <nerdcore> thanks programmerq that is also helpful
[00:03:36] <nerdcore> One option we've been discussing here is the notion of pinning only majoe versions in an image tag, so for example "node:14" rather than "node:14.17.3-buster" or "node:latest". Does this approach make good sense, realizing of course what programmerq said about there being no standard format (rhyme&reason) to version tags across all Docker Hub
[00:03:45] <nerdcore> *major versions
[00:04:21] <programmerq> nerdcore that does make sense, yes. this is especially true with the official images since they all adopt a fairly standard tagging approach for most images.
[00:04:23] <programmerq> (if not all)
[00:04:43] <nerdcore> excellent, that is reassuring that we are barking up a good tree ;)
[00:05:24] <programmerq> that's also partly why I chose an official image for an example in that SO answer.

[00:21:02] <papa-dinkle> hi folks. Anyone have a recommended docker image to be base of Django projects? python-alpine variants require a lot of manual compilation of things and end up kinda big
[00:23:05] <tabakhase> usually those have a debian/ubuntu variant if that helps
[00:23:20] <tabakhase> there you get wheels and all that stuff
[00:23:48] <papa-dinkle> @tabakhase: yeah it looks like i am moving in the direction of a larger linux distribution
[00:23:49] <nerdcore> and a cup holder and AM radio haha
[00:24:00] <papa-dinkle> @nerdcore lol
[00:24:18] <papa-dinkle> just a set of wheels is all i need, man!
[00:24:41] <nerdcore> is it common to use Ubuntu as a base image? I realize there is a well-maintained official Ubuntu image, but doesn't this fly in the face of the Docker paradigm that a container does one-thing-and-one-thing-only? Ubuntu is HUGE compared to Alpine, or even a barebones Debian for that matter
[00:25:28] <tabakhase> "larger" is kinda relative... yea alpine is like 4mb -- but debian slim is also only like 20 or so? - even full is 50?
[00:25:37] <tabakhase> so in the end all kinda whatevers
[00:25:41] <papa-dinkle> exactly the predicament i am in
[00:25:55] <papa-dinkle> oh wow didn't realize debian slim is that small
[00:26:18] <nerdcore> sure but Ubuntu typically installs like 4GB or so; not sure about its official Docker base image, but the regular Ubuntu Desktop from ISO is really big for a docker container
[00:26:43] <nerdcore> even Ubuntu Server is quite large base install IIRC
[00:26:54] <tabakhase> nerdcore "none of that is actually running" - the whole point of distros under it is "just so you can use apt/yum/rpm/apk" you could say - so the "one thing per" remains just fine
[00:27:26] <tabakhase> like as long as you dont start anything with "CMD /sbin/init" :P
[00:27:30] <nerdcore> tabakhase: sure, but if your one application bring 4GB of cruft, that's not ideal
[00:28:18] <s17> like a base Ubuntu
[00:29:48] <tabakhase> not ideal, but "who cares in the grand scheme of things...?" -- given that layers are shared across all images anyhow its not even "bad on diskussage" if you say coordinate your services to tap of the same versions - now only "bad" thats left is having to download that extra 4gb "once"
[00:30:55] <nerdcore> interesting take on it, thanks tabakhase
[00:31:15] <tabakhase> and not sure where you pull 4gb from -- compressed ubuntu is also just about 30mb
[00:32:50] <nerdcore> really? because Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 ISO is 1.1GB; Is the Docker Hub image really <100MB?
[00:33:01] <tabakhase> key is that the "one-thing-and-one-thing-only" is correct and absolutely remains true there too
[00:33:11] <tabakhase> thatzs what the hub says.. https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu?tab=tags&page=1&ordering=last_updated
[00:33:30] <tabakhase> isos are pretty bad comparrison, they include half the apt-repos and a bunch of languages and such "junk"
[00:33:51] <nerdcore> interesting... So now I wonder what the differences are between a baremetal install from ISO vs Docker Hub base image
[00:34:08] <tabakhase> like the whole desktop env. with x11 and all - not needed in docker like "ever"
[00:34:22] <nerdcore> not included in the Server ISO either ;)
[00:35:00] <nerdcore> Desktop ISO is 2.7GB :P
[00:35:02] <tabakhase> then things get just as small -> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD Ubuntu 18.04 "Bionic Beaver" 64MB
[00:35:57] <papa-dinkle> python:alpine (45mb)----install django and db connector--> 537mb
[00:36:15] <papa-dinkle> python:slim (115mb)----install django and db connector ---> 171mb
[00:37:26] <tabakhase> ye alpine is musl not glibc - so it has to compile lots of things you can download as ready-made-wheel on debian&co -- could prob be fixed with some cleanup step there have a poke at https://github.com/wagoodman/dive
[00:37:57] <tabakhase> (note that "cleanup" has to happen in the same RUN block or space will not actually be freed up)
[00:43:00] <programmerq> papa-dinkleâ–¸ I'm a fan of the -slim images for python compiled modules for sure.
[00:43:17] <programmerq> I go with -alpine variants if it's all pure python just because I dig alpine. I like debian well enough too.
[00:45:40] <tabakhase> should be faster to build too when it can use wheels
[00:46:03] <papa-dinkle> yeah that's definitely a huge benefit

[22:08:42] <papa-dinkle> all said and done my image is now 500mb which I might have to get used to. I was expecting some nice little micro services under 100 mb

[22:19:19] <papa-dinkle> mysql server is on another container so i need mysqlclient

[22:19:33] <papa-dinkle> all the dependencies for the client
[22:21:11] <s17> mm

[22:29:07] <papa-dinkle> and maybe I should be expecting image sizes > 500mb

[22:42:39] <s17> so, I'm using yii2-php, which is 738MB, but when I do changes and push to remote repo, it only pushes the new/updated layers, which is nice
