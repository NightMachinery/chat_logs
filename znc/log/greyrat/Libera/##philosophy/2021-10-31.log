[08:41:47] <I_Am_M00t> hi chatguy
[08:43:41] <chatguy> nondualism is a philosophy that exists in some religions
[08:44:00] <chatguy> or its a philosophical and/or spiritual concept that is common in some religions
[08:44:04] <chatguy> e.g. advaita vedanta

[22:24:46] <Digit> cats eat mice.  that's natural.  keeps populations in check.  seems weird to want more mice (which some call "vermin", and can eat away important bits of homes)
[22:25:03] <ldlework> Digit: nothing i said implicates a desire for more mice
[22:25:43] <Digit> mnemon: adds up to helping balances.  how many babies do mice have a go, up to a common 6?   and in how many months?  2 or 3?
[22:26:02] <Digit> ldlework: no, but that's what you'll get.
[22:26:21] <Digit> lest you're stamping on the mice, as well as denying your cat them.  n_n
[22:26:32] <mnemon> Digit: 3-14 pups every month or 2
[22:26:36] <ldlework> i'm totally indifferent to the number of mice and the matter is your invention here
[22:27:08] <ldlework> i was remarking that it's interesting how my cat never had to hunt, but has no problem doing so regardless
[22:27:12] <Digit> i stopped being indifferent to mice, when one cralled over me while in bed.

[22:27:35] <ldlework> i don't live in the third world fortunately
[22:27:50] <Digit> thus, increasing the population of mice, compared to if you'd let your cat have it.
[22:28:06] <Digit> mice dont care if you're in the third world. lol.

[22:39:05] <ldlework> mnemon: the reason i'm sensitive is because it's happened. she has white fur all along her face and chest. it was a bloody nightmare
[22:39:20] <ldlework> lesson learned.
[22:39:41] <mnemon> hehe, maybe lack of practice
