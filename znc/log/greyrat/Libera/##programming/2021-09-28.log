[00:01:35] <pyzozord> huh? you mean bigints but hardware?
[00:02:51] <pyzozord> I think the whole point about bigints is that they are software P
[00:03:16] <pyzozord> that's how they can be arbitrary length, limited by only by ram 
[00:03:18] <user51> i thought that it would be similar to just doing the calculation on N bits and checking for carry

[00:09:54] <CodePoint> pyzozord, bigints can be implimented in hardware.  There is no reason they could not be.

[07:00:30] <node1> Hi any github master here?
[07:00:31] <InPhase> The density of trolls on libera is not really very high to begin with.  Most people are just trying to get through their day, or learn some things.  A few have emotional or other issues they don't know how to deal with.  Some have trouble getting along well with others and get into fights.  Some try to crack jokes that are in a bad context or not understood.  A pretty rare set of people are 
[07:00:37] <InPhase> genuinely out to troll.  But mostly, it's a network full of good people who are just around to chat and people trying to boost up their skills a bit.
[07:01:09] <arahael> That's my experience in this channel, at least, too.
[07:03:18] <leduyquang753> Pretty much all the kids and trolls have moved to somewhere else like Discord.
[07:03:33] <InPhase> node1: I doubt anyone would feel safe answering yes to that.  git is a feisty dragon sometimes.  :)  You're better off just asking the question and seeing if anyone knows the answer.

[07:04:26] <InPhase> github is reasonably straightforward except for the git parts.
[07:04:43] <InPhase> And, well, the non-standard interactions between github and git.
[07:04:52] <arahael> InPhase: Oh, yeah?
[07:05:06] <InPhase> Unfortunately that's a lot of the site though.  :)
[07:05:13] <arahael> I'm much more familiar with gitlab, personally.

[07:06:12] <InPhase> Overall though I think github does about as well as I could expect a site to do web-wrapping git.
[07:06:23] <node1> I'm just trying to set a pipeline for my django project. And i want that runner should do the following  two actions.  1. 1. Get into my project root directory & activate virtual environment.  2. 2. Fetch( or pull) the changes from the github repository
[07:07:52] <InPhase> node1: Well start by looking at Github Actions, instead of "pipeline".
[07:08:31] <node1> Well i have look for it but no proper documentation,   uses: actions/checkout@v2 << -- this will clone the repository. 
[07:09:15] <node1> I'm looking for fetch or pull the changes from remote repository.
[07:09:24] <InPhase> The rest of what you're trying to do is not quite clear to me from the description.  (Although I'm probably not the right person to answer it anyway, but it's probably not clear yet to others either.)

[11:41:26] <mrig> I dont think that it is.
[11:41:42] <mrig> it is different on every machine, that is hardly common :D
[11:41:44] <iridium__> Python sucks in the most pathetic ways possible. i hate Python.
[11:41:58] <user51> i think it's the lowest common denominator when you consider dimnishing returns
[11:42:01] <iridium__> it doesn't even have convenient first-class functions.

[13:49:50] <vdamewood> Ah, yeah, the Slavic languages are also not Germanic.
[13:49:53] <DnzAtWrk> here we have swedish/norwegian/danish, and then finnish which is entirely its own thing
[13:50:01] <Deknos> not, but german is a mix also. for example the word nose in german is "nase" which comes from french, which was then transfered to saxon also and then nowadays english. 
[13:50:17] <Deknos> bavarian has a strong slavic influence for example
[13:50:35] <vdamewood> Deknos: Languages exchange vocabulary, sure. But that doesn't change what language family a language is in, or which branch.
[13:50:58] <DnzAtWrk> sometimes the vocabulary changes within the language too
[13:51:02] <vdamewood> Persian imported a bunch vocabulary from Arabic, but it's still an Indo-European language.
[13:51:17] <DnzAtWrk> some swedish dialects are so odd that even as a native swedish speaker you may be confused
[13:51:28] <vdamewood> English imported a bunch from French, Latin, and Greek. It's still a Germanic language.

[13:52:10] <Deknos> well, german is a mix of these language families. at least that is my knowledge of that.
[13:52:32] <vdamewood> That's now how it works in linguistics.
[13:52:35] <vdamewood> not*
[13:52:40] <mrig> vdamewood: oh that sounds promising, thank you.
[13:53:31] <vdamewood> Which family or branch a language is in is based solely on which language is evolved from. Not where a language has imported vocabulary from.
[13:55:08] <Deknos> enlighten me :)
[13:55:18] <Deknos> so, language families cannot merge?
[13:55:21] <Deknos> never?
[13:55:34] <Deknos> perhaps my example was just bad?
[13:56:21] <vdamewood> Language *families* never merge, no. But you can get a merger of two different languages called a pidgin.

[13:59:09] <Deknos> okay, yeah, families cannot merge. but on what criteria is decided if a language is a pidgin of for example 3 languages?
[13:59:52] <Deknos> with families, i meant that saxon and english and french are the same family and (their ancestors) merged  to german.
[13:59:54] <vdamewood> Deknos: Pidgins usually have simplified grammar and vocabulary, and no native speakers.

[14:02:17] <Deknos> with that definition all european languages would not be pidgins, but i argue that the influence into each other languages in the central european space is so heavy that quite a few there (german as an example) are a mix of that
[14:02:33] <vdamewood> The term for that is sprachbund.
[14:03:53] <vdamewood> The languages are still considered to be part of their original families, and branches of their families, but as part of the sprachbund they influence each other.

[15:07:57] <DPA> C to HDL may not be the greatest idea. C is a language which pretty much goes "do this, then that, then the statement after that". I haven't done any HDL/FPEGA stuff yet, but it's basically "These things are connected like that, now do all these things once, then repeat.".
[15:07:57] <DPA> To some extent, there are things in C where ordering in practice won't matter, which can be done in parallel. But often, there are steps that just can't be taken apart like that. Those are going to slow some things down.

[17:33:22] <minall> Hello programming community!
[17:33:41] <pyzozord> not having call stack seems like it could have interesting implications
[17:33:48] <bjs> pyzozord: Haskell doesn't have one
[17:33:58] <bjs> which is what merijn is getting at I think
[17:34:02] <merijn> Yeah
[17:34:04] <bjs> or rather, GHC doesn't.  I think Hugs did
[17:34:05] <pyzozord> each call site needs to take care of the memory itself
[17:34:07] <bjs> not that anyone used it
[17:34:13] <merijn> bjs: Hugs was used a lot
[17:34:19] <bjs> merijn: uses* it then :P

[17:34:36] <merijn> For a long time Hugs was one of the biggest (if not biggest?) Haskell implementations
[17:34:37] <minall> I like to study different topics, like SQL, Docker, or other programming languages, yet I thing I could do my learning better... In your experience, what do you do that works the most for learning someone as fast as possible?, demostrating that you know it?
[17:34:43] <merijn> But that's in the late 90s, early 00s
[17:35:00] <merijn> by 2005ish GHC had all but eclipsed it into obsolescence
[17:35:14] <pyzozord> merijn: practice and projects
[17:35:19] <pyzozord> minall: ^
[17:35:40] <merijn> pyzozord: The problem with call stacks is for "remembering the local state needed when another call returns"
[17:35:49] *** Joins: DPA (~DPA@75-128-16-94.static.cable.fcom.ch)
[17:35:53] <merijn> pyzozord: GHC's compilation model solves that by simply never returning
[17:36:26] <minall> pyzozord, Let's say, for example Docker... I understand now the concepts of Docker, yet I'm still at a blank when doing something and, I have to look for commands... What can I do to improve this and, actually doing important projects that show that I know all the basics and a little more?... Where's the line of: This is enough?
[17:36:40] <pyzozord> merijn: if functions never return, and state is never mutated... how is information passed?
[17:37:17] <bjs> pyzozord: if you pattern match something you need to save it, if you don't, there's no information needed to save
[17:37:19] <bjs> in Haskell
[17:37:26] <merijn> pyzozord: GHC's compilation model is based on "Continuation Passing Style", instead of "returning" every function takes a "continuation" i.e. "what to call when you're done"
[17:38:05] <pyzozord> minall: there is no line, you just do everything as much as you can. Try to just focus on the thing that is the most important at the moment. That will kind of "load balance" / prioritize your time
[17:38:11] <merijn> pyzozord: So if you have code like "foo(bar(x))" in a stack setting you'd first call "bar" with 'x'" and need the stack to remember local variables, then, when it returns you call foo
[17:38:29] <minall> pyzozord: Thanks for the advice, guess I'm on the right path!
[17:38:32] <oldlaptop> minall: There is no substitute for practice, or for practical experience.
[17:38:39] <merijn> pyzozord: With CPS you modify bar so it takes an extra argument (the continuation) and compile it as "bar(x, foo)"
[17:38:54] <merijn> And instead of bar doing "return" with its result, it just calls "foo" with its result
[17:39:34] <oldlaptop> javascript programmers are very familiar with this concept, and call it the "callback pyramid of doom"
[17:39:41] <merijn> pyzozord: All the relevant local variables are part of the "foo" closure, so those have a static lifetime (until the closure is called)

[17:39:58] <merijn> oldlaptop: That's because doing it manually is for crazy people. That's what compilers are for :p
[17:40:05] <pyzozord> so the information only travels one way: in
[17:40:14] <merijn> pyzozord: "forward", but yes
[17:40:19] <pyzozord> yeah
[17:40:37] <pyzozord> cool cool cool
[17:41:07] <merijn> pyzozord: Note, that most (optimising) imperative compilers for things like C and C++ use something called SSA (Static Single Assignment) where all variables are only ever assigned once to optimise code
[17:41:30] <merijn> pyzozord: And if you kinda squint while looking at SSA and CPS you realise they're kinda the same idea, represented differently

[17:41:56] <merijn> In both cases you limit information flow to only be forwards, so that you can more easily determine what can be safely reordered
[17:42:17] <oldlaptop> I suppose javascript programmers are nothing if not crazy people
[17:42:42] <merijn> So "a = 1; foo(a); a = 2;" gets compiled to, like "a_0 = 1; foo(a_0); a_1 = 2;" with all references changed accordingly
[17:43:19] <merijn> Now it doesn't matter whether you reorder operations, as long as everything referring to a_0 is "after" a_0 is set
[17:43:42] <merijn> And all uses of "a" in the original code are updated to refer to correct unique variables
[17:43:47] <vdamewood> But are crazy people nothing?
[17:44:38] <pyzozord> merijn: but aren't local variables for example in C later translated to stack? Not sure what's the reason behind SSA
[17:45:20] *** Joins: quartz (~quartz@user/quartz)
[17:46:39] <bjs> pyzozord: SSA is a form you can re-write programs into to remove all the complexities of variables/bindings
[17:46:45] <merijn> pyzozord: The reason for SSA is to make the ordering of mutation explicit in the form of unique variables per update. Which means your optimiser doesn't have to worry about mutability

[19:35:50] <pyzozord> calculus and linear algeba sounds kind of basic (not that I know any of it)

[19:36:13] <Izem> Is it just tesseract?
[19:36:46] <Izem> pyzozord: what were you expecting? :P
[19:38:07] <pyzozord> not sure. But in some sense stuff like lambda calculus sounds like more advanced math the normal calclulus and linear algebra
[19:39:09] <pyzozord> things like category theory, even graph theory kind of sounds more advanced, or am I wrong?
[19:39:18] <Izem> idk, calculus may just be another one of those really overused terms in math

[19:39:27] <Izem> lamba calc is way easier than calclus

[19:40:06] <Izem> yeah
[19:40:10] <pyzozord> isn't it just like... a division at the core of it?
[19:40:39] <Izem> doesn't have as nice material on it as the other topics in my experience

[19:41:58] <Izem> plus afer the intro it's partial differential equations xD
[19:42:12] <Psybur> Calculus II was hard, calc 1 wasnt too bad
[19:42:26] <pyzozord> that there are is probably a shitton of small little theromes and other bullshits that are PITA and irrelevant
[19:42:32] <Izem> pyzozord: it probably isn't but I doubt you will get a text, or teacher that can do that for you
[19:42:40] <InPhase> pyzozord: Aside from memorizing trig integrals and similar such stuff, calculus is in fact very straightforward.
[19:43:28] <Izem> pyzozord: math texts don't usally introduce theorems without using it
[19:43:38] <pyzozord> InPhase: aha! Good to know! I'll pay attention to trigonometric stuff. I need to learn it by heart anyway, as a wannabe game developer
[19:43:42] <gggpkm> what is g in grpc?
[19:43:43] <InPhase> Calc I and III are therefore straightforward, but there's a tricky patch during Calc II that there's no simple reasoning process for.

[19:44:29] <Izem> calc III has PDEs right?
[19:44:30] <InPhase> Differential equations are also very straightforward and empowering, but analytical solutions are not always available, and it can be tricky to figure out if they are, analogous to that section of Calc II.

[19:45:12] <Izem> category theory is pretty advanced yeah
[19:45:17] <InPhase> The real-world way to handle calculus is therefore to grasp and comprehend all the intuitive parts, and whip out a symbolic integrator to help with the esoteric parts that you would otherwise need to remember.
[19:45:18] <Izem> that's correct

[19:47:09] <Izem> making a symbolic integrator sounds fun
[19:47:35] <pyzozord> Izem: not all. I think of math as 1) axioms 2) theroms 3) general puzzle solving

[19:50:24] <pyzozord> thanks!
[19:50:41] <Izem> wxmaxima might be 40 years old :O
[19:50:54] <independent56> So the difference between Fedora and Redhat is the difference between IdeaJ commerce and IdeaJ Community?

[19:57:33] <InPhase> And, very thankfully, a symbolic algebra engine's assistance.
[19:58:02] <InPhase> I made use of them a lot after that experience.
[19:58:22] <pyzozord> so this is algebra huh, just done on calculus. But there is too much of it, so we can relay on computers to correct us if we forget some of the details

[19:59:46] <Izem> same approach really
[19:59:55] <InPhase> The symbolic algebra engines get stuck sometimes, and they don't know how to make certain simplifications or approximations justified by the real world, so one often needs to guide them along through steps.

[23:25:24] <pyzozord> althgouh they have $25/m too, so that's pretty cool, you can just pay for one month and finish one angular course
[23:25:38] <Voidwarper> I found a book for angular 
[23:25:39] <austincheney> if you are a Java developer that wants to hit the ground running without learning what's really happening then Angular might be your flavor

[23:26:29] <Voidwarper> Found it off a recommendation on reddit, seems to have good reviews 
[23:26:41] <Voidwarper> I need to learn angular with typescript

[23:27:14] <Voidwarper> austincheney: how is it connected to Java? 
[23:27:55] <austincheney> Voidwarper, similar architectural patterns
[23:28:46] <Voidwarper> Oh I see. No I am mostly self taught and had some lessons on university, c and Fortran. Not very familiar with oop
[23:29:02] <Voidwarper> Will be working on front-end for starters 
[23:29:46] <Guest86> for typescript something are annoyingly overtyped 
[23:29:50] <pyzozord> angular is not structured like most javascript frameworks

[23:30:24] <pyzozord> angular is clearly made by people who liked java, not javascript
[23:30:45] <pyzozord> it's full of things like dependency injection and other over the top OOP design patterns
[23:31:06] <Voidwarper> A friend of mine told me to learn angular for the job, and that I can pick up html and css automatically when implementing things, even Javascript. So I got this book that focuses on angular with some typescript. 
[23:31:56] <Voidwarper> Debating if I should learn exclusively typescript first 
[23:32:20] <austincheney> Voidwarper, then you will likely find angular unnecessarily frustrating.  I am also self-taught, so these giant frameworks look like window dressing to me for parents with hyper children who are too busy to supply the guidance the young'ins need
[23:33:31] <Voidwarper> yes unfortunately is used as a framework for big projects 
[23:34:24] <Voidwarper> He did show me a few things but seems to chaotic, doesn't even look like programming

[23:37:33] <austincheney> I have been doing this for a while and my experience tells me there is a super beginner problem many developers never learn to solve:  composition, as in how to put things together.  Instead they learn a couple of patterns and live/die by those pattners.
[23:37:44] <austincheney> then after a while they become expert beginners

[23:39:38] <user51> what is composition
[23:39:42] <Voidwarper> Yes I would prefer to eventual have a more global perspective 
[23:40:14] *** Joins: independent56 (~independe@51.15.187.53)
[23:41:12] <austincheney> composition is how to put things together whether those things are different bits of logic, files, or entire sections of a program

[23:42:57] <austincheney> take OOP, for example.  OOP was created to scale application design by extending existing logic without duplicating that object storage in memory.  Languages like Java and C# are garbage collected so you have no say in how memory is managed.  OOP is used there purely for composition.
