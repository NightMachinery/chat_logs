[18:39:38] <madduck> I have an issue with mutt sending a MIME-multipart message with an rfc822 part that has a UTF8 header via local sendmail. This is the message: https://scratch.madduck.net/mutt-message
[18:40:17] <madduck> if I send this message via mutt using sendmail, it somehow submits it to postfix such that postfix requests SMTPUTF8 from the relayhost, and the message fails with "(SMTPUTF8 is required, but was not offered by host madduck-net.smtp.madduck.net[188.174.253.166])"
[18:40:48] <madduck> However, if I "set sendmail=/bin/cat" and take the output and manually pipe it into /usr/sbin/sendmail with the same arguments as mutt would use, the message goes through fine.
[18:40:58] <madduck> go make sense of that! ;)
