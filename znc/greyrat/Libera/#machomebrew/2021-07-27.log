[10:53:29] <sosodank> hey there. is this the irc channel for Homebrew/brew, the macOS/Linux packaging system?
[10:53:57] <sosodank> (i didn't find it on any documentation, just plugged machomebrew into libera)
[10:54:22] <sosodank> hoping that it is, i had a question about https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Formulae
[10:54:51] <sosodank> i'm the author of a library that has until recently been available only on Linux and the BSDs
[10:55:24] <sosodank> i recently added support for macOS, and have prepared a formula which i believe to be assembled according to recommended principles
[10:55:42] <sosodank> i was going to submit it, but noticed the line "We frown on authors submitting their own work unless it is very popular."
[10:56:29] <sosodank> and was hoping for some guidance. obviously it's not too popular on macOS, as it only very recently runs there. i'm not sure how to evaluate popularity overall, but it's present in at least a dozen Linux distributions, and has ~1K github stars, for whatever that's worth
[10:57:07] <sosodank> but i'm hoping to pick up macOS usage, which would definitely be facilitated by inclusion in the main Homebrew repository. it's very actively maintained
