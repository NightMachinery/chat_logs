[16:09:05] <rapha> hi all
[16:09:50] <rapha> is there a fancy hip new way (some CSS + JS thingamajig combo) for quickly making one of those 1-page sites which automatically look good on a mobile phone?
[16:11:41] <nbjoerg> rapha: you are looking for reactive designs and/or frameworks
[16:16:01] <rapha> hmm ouch and immediately i land in npm-only-land :-(
[16:17:08] <nbjoerg> well, you can do quite a few things with CSS3-only
[16:17:12] <rapha> and everything is revolutionary and can be learned in 1 hour and 37 minutes from "egghead" videos
[16:17:19] <stenno\OK> just use @media queries
[16:17:27] <rapha> i see
[16:17:40] <stenno\OK> not really in the scope of this channel though
[16:17:43] <nbjoerg> what stenno\OK said, works to a degree
[16:17:53] <rapha> and to send some async request and get something back and update something on the page, do people nowadays use raw JS for that?
[16:18:21] <nbjoerg> raw AJAX works reasonable well if you don't care about outdated IE versions
[16:18:44] <stenno\OK> people use fetch for that 
[16:19:00] <rapha> ah, nah, just firefox on the phone
[16:19:17] <rapha> as in , https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API , stenno\OK ?
[16:19:21] <stenno\OK> yes
[16:19:36] <rapha> ok lemme read that for a bit
[16:20:30] <stenno\OK> fetch('/data').then(resp => resp.json()).then(...)
[16:22:16] <stenno\OK> rapha: also check out #webdev, i think you will find better help regarding general webdev practices than here
[16:22:23] <stenno\OK> because this channel is just about html
[16:22:44] <rapha> oh ok, thx ... was indeed looking for a chan like that and couldn't decide between #html and #javascript and #css :)
[16:23:15] <rapha> stenno\OK: will just `fetch('/data')` on its own already place a request on the server?
[16:23:22] <stenno\OK> yes
[16:23:46] <rapha> oh cool. that makes things very simple then. let's try this.
[16:23:49] <stenno\OK> it returns a promise which resolves to Response, and from there you can continue to do whatever
[16:23:53] <stenno\OK> it is really simple, yeah
[16:25:03] <stenno\OK> also while bashing on MS, keep in mind that the concept of XHR actually was invented by MS
[16:25:42] <rapha> oh, no bashing here :)

[20:43:38] <Guest2051> hello how do i "make html" in windows? looking at a github page that tells me to compile it
[20:43:55] <stenno\OK> you don't need to compile html
[20:43:58] *** Guest2051 is now known as Guest20
[20:44:03] <stenno\OK> you can just write it into a text file and open it with a browser
[20:44:22] <stenno\OK> can you give a link to that page?
[20:44:58] <stenno\OK> its probably using some backend framework and/or bundler to compose the markup 
[20:45:33] <Guest20> stenno\OK https://github.com/csmastersUH/data_analysis_with_python_summer_2021
[20:45:35] <stenno\OK> but yeah, try it out, write a html document in your favorite text editor
[20:45:46] <Guest20> there is a Makefile
[20:46:02] <stenno\OK> oh no clue, this is def. unrelated to html though
[20:46:11] <Guest20> :C
[20:46:11] <stenno\OK> open up an issue on their gh page
[20:46:38] <stenno\OK> you can probably use make with WSL2
