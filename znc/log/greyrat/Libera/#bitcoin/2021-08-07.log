[20:01:12] <name_> so this represents all the unconfirmed transactions? https://mempool.space/
[20:01:36] <DeanGuss> All unconfirmed that the mempool.space node sees
[20:02:26] <name_> you mean all nodes not just one?
[20:02:53] <name_> mempool.space is one node?
[20:02:58] <DeanGuss> I mean every node's mempool can be different
[20:03:23] <B0g4r7> Block space availability has been good lately.  I sent 1 sat/vB yesterday and it went into a block straight away.
[20:03:53] <name_> i see so my pc (node) running bitcoin core has its own mempool and the node / pc where mempool.space lives has its own?
[20:04:21] <DeanGuss> correct.  They are probably the same most of the time
[20:04:28] <DeanGuss> but can be different
[20:04:36] <name_> ok thank you that helps
[20:05:42] <DeanGuss> You can do `bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo` to see yours
[20:06:21] <name_> awesome

[20:08:35] <name_> that helps a lot thanks
[20:08:37] <name_> another question
[20:09:30] <name_> on that website the block all the way to the left is the current block being worked on? The ones to the right are all completed? What does the color shading represent in each block? Why are they different?
[20:10:32] <name_> oh the size?
[20:11:15] <name_> so each block hash can be solved at different sizes where the size represents number of transactions?
[20:12:20] *** Quits: _andrewtoth_ (~andrewtot@gateway/tor-sasl/andrewtoth) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[20:12:33] <DeanGuss> I think the color represents like whether the block is > 10 minutes or not
[20:12:56] <name_> that is what i thought at first but then i saw https://mempool.space/blocks
[20:13:06] <name_> and it has the size of each one
[20:13:33] <name_> but actually that makes sense too
[20:13:46] <name_> because the smaller the size the faster it would complete?
[20:14:08] <DeanGuss> no
[20:14:10] <name_> damn
[20:14:49] <AndyS2> the current block on the left is a theoretical block, I don't think mempool.space mines anyhthing. they just look at their own mempool and decide rationally which transactions to put in (i.e. those who pay most per vbyte)
[20:15:01] *** Joins: Aaronvan_ (~AaronvanW@190.150.26.4)
[20:16:10] <name_> ok
[20:16:38] <AndyS2> once a block is mined, it will probably contain a similar amount of transactions with similar fee rates if the mempool of the node of mempool.space is mostly similar to the one of the node of the miner
[20:18:23] <AndyS2> there's many reasons why blocks between miners differ, but the most important one for the miner(s) is probably the first transaction in a block, also called the coinbase transaction (has nothing to do with the exchange). that one pays out the new coins according to the rules, and the fees collected from the inclusion of other transactions.
[20:18:28] *** Quits: AaronvanW (~AaronvanW@190.150.26.4) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[20:19:26] <name_> ok that i understand
[20:19:48] <AndyS2> (not that mempool.space shows anything about the coinbase tx, just felt like adding that info because it makes it more placative why not all miners are ever working on the same next block)
[20:20:46] <name_> i am wondering though how to differentiate a node running bitcoin core from a miner node? Do you have to configure bitcoin core to be a miner on your PC versus a regular node on the network that does not mine anything and acts like a torrent seeding kind of?
[20:22:52] <name_> I am reading 'The Basics of Bitcoins and Blockchains' and am about halfway through the book and it has not discussed mining yet. It just mentioned the mempool. It has gone over the coinbase transaction inside a block.
[20:23:00] <AndyS2> I don't know much about this, but AFAIK bitcoin core can provide block templates, which is what you'd throw your miner at.
[20:23:34] <AndyS2> most people use pools, anyway, and most pool protocols don't require you to run a node at all.
[20:24:31] <name_> How do you use regular pools?
[20:24:36] <name_> and not need to run a node?
[20:25:26] <AndyS2> in the early days bitcoin core had an option to mine with it using your cpu, probably using 'getblocktemplate' within that code. In a way every node isn't much different from a miner who never finds a block ;)
[20:25:49] <AndyS2> but it'd just be wasting electricity to mine on cpu, so that was removed
[20:26:40] <Keele> name_: I think the answer you're looking for is "stratum"
[20:26:42] <name_> except the miner gets rewarded and regular node people don't get anything except wasting electricity?
[20:27:14] <AndyS2> name_: if the miner never finds a block, he never is rewarded (talking without taking pools into account here)
[20:27:28] *** Aaronvan_ is now known as AaronvanW
[20:27:49] <name_> stratum? I search it on google but not sure which one you are referring to?
[20:28:03] <AndyS2> try the bitcoin wiki: en.bitcoin.it
[20:28:22] *** Joins: ano (~weechat@user/ano)
[20:28:41] <name_> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Stratum
[20:29:07] <AndyS2> yeahm, the mining extension
[20:29:37] <name_> interesting
[20:30:38] <AndyS2> the reason why the book hasn't covered the details of mining yet is probably that they are boring. it's more interesting how block templates are built. finding a hash with lots of zeroes in the front for that block template (by increasing a counter field, etc) isn't really something you can fill a book with I guess :)

[20:32:28] <AndyS2> IMO you can read the mastering bitcoin book right away. might prevent some misunderstandings
[20:33:11] <name_> yea i did at first but found it a bit too technical which is why i am trying a few others like this one first
[20:33:19] <earnestly> It is fre and errata-corrected their on github as well
[20:33:25] <AndyS2> if people could just start with a fresh brain to really understand bitcoin it'd be easier IMO. there's so much half-correct information out there
[20:33:25] <earnestly> free*
[20:33:46] <AndyS2> earnestly: didn't the printed book contain something about segwit, though, whereas the github one doesn't?
[20:33:56] <AndyS2> don't have it at hand atm

[20:36:56] <AndyS2> aren't they writing a lightning network one?
[20:37:14] <name_> you mean a complete book just on the lightning network separate from mastering bitcoin?

[23:54:31] <plankers> is it accurate to say that the uselessness of the work that goes into verifying the blockchain for anything other than verifying the blockchain is a desirable quality of bitcoin?
[23:55:10] <plankers> im thinking that security is increased when there are no vectors to muck about with the verification process
[23:55:17] <plankers> not quite sure tho
[23:55:36] <earnestly> The premise is wrong because it's conflating the purpose of the work with the work itself
[23:56:05] <plankers> that sounds circular
[23:56:16] <earnestly> Or I'm not understanding the question
[23:56:24] *** Quits: quack_ (~ambassado@142.182.101.118) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:56:33] <plankers> its a weird point im trying to understand myself
[23:56:35] <earnestly> (And no it's circular, it's categorical)
[23:57:15] <plankers> since there is no incentive for people to use the compute that goes into verifying the bitcoin blockchain, this eliminates the possibility of malign incentives being introduced
[23:57:42] <plankers> er, no incentive to use that compute for anything _other_ than verifying the bitcoin blockchain
[23:58:19] <plankers> or other SHA256 coins, i suppose
[23:58:52] <plankers> but thats still using the compute for blockchain verification purposes rather than, say, running a social network where people trade digital cats
[23:59:01] <earnestly> This seems like asking if it's good that the work itself cannot be used as a commodity, in which case, yes, this is good
[23:59:14] <plankers> ah, thats a good framing of the problem
[23:59:24] <plankers> thx :)
