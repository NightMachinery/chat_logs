[10:28:21] <lisp123> Is this considered okay style or is there an alternative better way: https://plaster.tymoon.eu/view/2609#2609
[10:28:52] <lisp123> (it is elisp code, but basically the question is if its fine to call eval within a function where I am constructing expressions on the fly with ` and , @)?
[10:31:05] <beach> It doesn't look great to me.
[10:31:09] <lisp123> I guess there is a possibility for arbitrary code injection...but if the function is not exposed, that gets minimised

[10:31:46] <beach> I don't know what that means.  Sorry.
[10:31:58] *** Joins: shka (~herr@109.231.62.239)
[10:32:40] <lisp123> I am using ,@ to splice a list, hence need to use eval to evaluate the expression
[10:33:14] <beach> How about using APPLY?
[10:34:33] <lisp123> Hmm let me try
[10:34:53] <beach> You just basically want to call propertize on all the elements of a list as argument, right?
[10:35:02] <lisp123> No, they are arguments
[10:35:15] <lisp123> So not a repeated application of propertize
[10:35:15] <beach> I think that's what I said, no?
[10:35:47] <beach> If you have a list like (a b c d), you want to call (propertize a b c d), yes?
[10:35:57] <lisp123> Yes
[10:36:03] <beach> That's what APPLY does.
[10:36:10] <beach> (apply #'propertize list)
[10:37:00] <beach> Also, why on earth do you do (propertize ,(car string ,@(cdr string))) rather than (propertize ,@string)?

[10:39:52] <lisp123> beach: Thanks. The code evaluates, but doesn't give the outcome, but I think now its an elisp question - it evaluates correctly except for applying the propertize part, so I think that means APPLY works well
[10:39:59] <lisp123> Thanks for your help
[10:40:29] <lisp123> I was just prototyping :) First part was the text, hence I took the car of it - but yes, makes sense to fix that up
[10:40:59] <beach> And your naming sucks.  Why would a variable named STRINGS contain anything other than strings?
[10:42:02] <lisp123> Each to their own. Its a function that prints strings, but I give myself the opportunity to add in font colors / bolding etc.
[10:42:19] <lisp123> but each item in strings is conceptually a string, either unformatted or formatted
[10:42:39] <lisp123> Not in the sense of the data type string
[10:42:50] <beach> But that's now how the convention goes.
[10:42:51] <lisp123> But in the general sense
[10:43:14] <lisp123> I guess I could call it texts?
[10:44:32] <beach> That's hard to say, given that I don't really know what they are.  But it looks general enough that I might just call them ITEMS and explain in a comment what shape an ITEM can have.
[10:44:59] <lisp123> You know what, I agree with you now
[10:45:04] <lisp123> I will change it to 'outputs'
[10:45:27] <lisp123> Strings is confusing once I look at it again
[10:48:18] <lisp123> beach: On an unrelated note, would it be possible to automate the SICL repo to produce pdfs for the documentation?
[10:49:01] <lisp123> It would make it very convenient for quick browsing of various concepts, especially given how well documented it is :)
[10:49:05] <beach> I don't know.  Usually you just have to type `make'.  But you can also read it online.
[10:49:21] <beach> http://metamodular.com/SICL/sicl-specification.pdf as I recall.
[10:50:44] <lisp123> Great - thanks for the link

[11:20:10] <lisp123> You can ask here
[11:20:13] <ln43> i?m asking because now to use clml i should increase the heap size
[11:20:56] <lisp123> Sorry, don't know the answer
[11:20:57] <ln43> and soing it by running sbcl from the command line with the flag sbcl --dynamic-space-size 2750 works
[11:21:09] <ln43> but how to do that from the repl?
[11:21:46] <ln43> i mean if i don't know where Portacle put the configuration file that is used to laod sbcl is impossible to solve my issue
[11:21:59] <ln43> it should start sbcl whit another heap size
[11:22:15] <ln43> because i don't think is possible to variate that parameter at run time
[11:22:18] <ln43> or not?

[11:25:49] <lisp123> And figuring how that works
[11:26:10] <lisp123> I believe its a configuration setting for sbcl, so if you can fidn the version that portacle uses (its directory has all the files)

[11:30:27] <lisp123> For what its worth
[11:30:35] <lisp123> if you want to make changes to your emacs config in portacle
[11:30:41] <lisp123> in the same directory, there is a user.el
[11:30:50] <lisp123> that's where you put all your changes
[11:31:36] <lisp123> Also google .sbclrc and how that works - perhaps you need to create that file and put the changes there

[11:32:37] <ln43> ok, thank you... i don't have too much luck generally ... :/

[11:35:00] <ln43> is too late to begin for me :)
[11:38:20] <lisp123> ln43
[11:38:39] <lisp123> Try something like (setq inferior-lisp-program "sbcl --dynamic-space-size ....")
[11:38:46] <lisp123> in your user.el in portacle
[11:40:54] <ln43> yes ok
[11:41:07] <lisp123> worked?
[11:46:02] <ln43> but i think that file is only for the genrral setup of the gui interface: there is no mention to the CL implementation ...
[11:46:10] <ln43> *general
[11:48:44] <lisp123> No its a file that gets loaded on startup
[11:48:51] <lisp123> its basically the same as your .emacs
[11:49:02] <lisp123> So I'm (hopefully) 90% sure that it will work
[11:49:38] <lisp123> Basically that line above is overriding the configuration in Emacs / Portacle to use sbcl with the set space size - the answer was accepted on Stack Overflow, so I'm reasonably sure it will work
[11:53:01] <lisp123> You may need to restart your inferior lisp via M-x slime-restart-inferior-lisp since Portacle may load that before that setting goes into effect
