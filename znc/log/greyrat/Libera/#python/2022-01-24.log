[00:19:37] <EtherMan_> to execute Work plugins and so on. I do find a couple of guides on plugin writing but I'm not finding any for the type of plugin system I'm looking for and instead are plugins where the base system basically has to be made for the plugin and it's just a matter of if it's available or not :/

[00:24:03] <df00z> an rely on interprocess communication
[00:24:19] <bjs> EtherMan_: I'd recommend the threading module for a nicer interface :P
[00:24:52] <kosh> python has multithreading but it doesn't currently work very well for CPU scaling if your program is spending most of its time running python code because of the GIL and that is an issue being worked on
[00:25:07] <EtherMan_> bjs: I was going to with this project and take it as a reason to learn it. But I've really only used the old myself :)
[00:25:07] <df00z> ^^^
[00:25:10] <bjs> EtherMan_: anyway, I don't think the asyncio portion complicates the plugin system very much
[00:25:17] <ChrisWarrick> EtherMan_: there exist a few plugin systems for python out there. You could make all your plugins implement some generic async def run(): method and run that with asyncio.gather or such.
[00:25:20] <df00z> Unless you use a different python engine, which they absolutely do exist
[00:25:21] <bjs> it's just your plugin functions become `async def`s
[00:25:28] <kosh> you can run multiple processes which works pretty well but it depends on your program
[00:25:45] <df00z> Yeah it massively depends on what you are trying to do
[00:26:32] <kosh> but it is not correct to say that python is single threaded because there are many uses of threads that are not used for cpu scaling like a threaded UI and that works fine

[01:17:48] <silverdeer> This article mentions the @staticmethod decorator "can be called from an uninstantiated class object".   -- https://stackabuse.com/pythons-classmethod-and-staticmethod-explained/  ...but... how can one have an object, created from a class, but that that object is not instantiated?
[01:18:08] <grym> silverdeer: the object is _the class itself_
[01:18:13] <grym> which is, of course, just an object too
[01:18:40] <silverdeer> ahh ok.  so the instance is taking that class... and building something with it... (which i'd typically call an "object" but maybe it's better called a "variable")
[01:18:52] <grym> an instance
[01:18:57] <BrenBarn> I think "uninitialized class object" means the class itself
[01:19:00] <grym> there's The Class that is The Idea Of A Car
[01:19:07] <grym> and then there's my car, parked outside; an instance of Car
[01:19:12] <silverdeer> gotcha

[02:29:44] <kosh> it depends I have seen people just make a list of tuples for instance so they did not make a class
[02:30:06] <kosh> and a list of tuples would still lose badly to a numpy array and the numpy array approach can be used even with OO code
[02:30:14] <kosh> most of the issues are people take things to an extreme
[02:30:19] <Gustavo6046> Which is something like store all your data in a tight collection (for SIMD and stuff), and then use metadata (like the width and height of your collection, or indices) to operate on it, through an interface to the rest of your program.

[05:54:20] <DarkTrick> just `python3 mypack`
[05:54:40] <scaramanga> you have `from htmlmerger import HtmlMerger`
[05:54:57] <scaramanga> but `HtmlMerger` is not in `htmlmerger` it's in `htmlmerger.htmlmerger`

[05:57:13] <scaramanga> :)
[05:57:15] <DarkTrick> scaramanga, files inside the package must not depend upon the package name.
[05:57:41] <scaramanga> DarkTrick, that's exactly what i'm saying :)
[05:58:13] <scaramanga> in that case your __main__ would want to do `from . import HtmlMerger` or `from .htmlmerger import HtmlMerger\

[06:00:18] <scaramanga> the problem that you are having is that `python htmlmerger` is not the same as `python -m htmlmerger`, and the latter is really what you want to be using if you want to avoid this kind of confusion :)
[06:01:01] <DarkTrick> scaramanga, "python htmlmerger" is easier to use for users. No user should need to know about the -m option.
[06:01:11] <DarkTrick> I need to work around this without needing the -m option
[06:01:19] <scaramanga> it's nowhere near as easy as "htmlmerger"
[06:01:29] <scaramanga> which will never work if you insist on being the lone package that works this way :)
[06:01:56] <scaramanga> users probably just want to "pip install htmlmerger"

[06:07:01] <scaramanga> you are going to be in for a fun time :)

[06:53:27] <silverdeer> [ OOP vs Functional Programming in Python ] -- I recently started at a company that uses Python OOP.  I have NodeJS background (plus a little Clojure-- and I like functional programming).   I am seeking some general advice about OOP Vs Functional in Python, because: 1. I have to finish some Python OOP projects. 2. I am considering doing my greenfield projects in Functional Python.  Any suggestions of things to keep in
[06:53:27] <silverdeer> mind / to utilize / to avoid?
[06:53:51] <SnoopJ> or yea, entrypoints are useful too, if users install a package (and this is as isk suggests the UX users will generally expect)
[06:53:53] <scaramanga> i use a lot of python programs, i've never referred to them by path
[06:53:58] <BrenBarn> I do find it annoying that it's so hard to run a python file with a totally "local" understanding of its own package position
[06:53:59] <scaramanga> i just pip install youtube-dl
[06:54:00] <BrenBarn> i.e., without installing it
[06:54:02] <scaramanga> then run youtube-dl
[06:54:22] <isk> BrenBarn: I share that sentiment
[06:54:40] <BrenBarn> the thing is that "-m" finds a module through the module search path, whereas just specifying a filename runs that particular file
[06:54:41] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, well, not all files are packages, so it's hard to tell what you mean

[06:56:14] <DarkTrick> scaramanga, I'm not familiar with pip. but I guess it's similar to ubuntu's apt. Which places the burden of "getting your software into the repos" - which is a tremendous burden. So I could never count on that
[06:56:18] <silverdeer> Do folks here mostly use OOP or Functional style with Python?
[06:56:46] <scaramanga> DarkTrick, it's as tremendous as creating an account and then picking a name for your package that isn't taken
[06:57:01] <scaramanga> pip installs packages, but that's where the similarity with apt ends
[06:57:07] <avu> silverdeer: the two aren't mutually exclusive. Most code I work on uses concepts from both schools

[06:57:41] <silverdeer> avu: Cool.  Yeah I've noticed in programming (i dont have a ton of exp-- about 3 yrs on and off professionally) that often some packages require/almost require you to engage w/ them in an OOP way

[07:13:19] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, what should that do if the code didn't come from a file (i.e. with -c?)
[07:13:40] <SnoopJ> And why the location of the file and not the CWD? It raises a lot of questions.
[07:16:23] <BrenBarn> it can fail if it fails
[07:16:49] <BrenBarn> like if you do it with -c and it fails, fine
[07:17:01] <BrenBarn> why the location of the file is because that's where the import is
[07:17:03] <SnoopJ> I don't even know how it would get as far as failing, because "the file" doesn't exist in the first place
[07:17:28] <BrenBarn> it can fail at the part where it tries to determine what the file is
[07:18:33] <BrenBarn> what I mean is I'm fine if trying `python -c "from .. import blah"` fails with some kind of import error
[07:18:56] <BrenBarn> basically I think it'd be nice to have a "local" import mechanism that files within a directory subtree can use to import other files from within the same subtree without needing to know about any kind of global persistent module search path
[07:19:17] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, importlib can do that along with the information in __file__
[07:19:25] <BrenBarn> not replacing that global module search path, but in addition to it
[07:19:36] <SnoopJ> it's not exactly like falling off a log because importlib's API is obtuse, but..

[07:41:38] <bpalmer> stewie925: the .assert_* things are convenience methods; you can be very explicit about what you want using the underlying data of call_list_arg  (or simiar things like call_count).

[07:59:41] <BrenBarn> you're arbitrarily stipulating that the "one" thing that the import currently means is "from the parent package" instead of some other formulation like "import the module specified by such-and-such process" (where the details of that process can change while still considering it to be one process)

[08:00:34] <BrenBarn> also, even if you suppose that, you can still just imagine that my proposal doesn't change that, but just changes the meaning of what "the parent package" may mean
[08:00:49] <BrenBarn> i.e., in some cases where there is currently not a parent package, there would be one under the new system

[08:22:32] <kuahara> Is there any easier way to do forms than tkinter?  Something more intuitive than trying to figure out the exact x,y coordinates of every item and field that goes on the form?
[08:22:34] <BrenBarn> I want to be able to execute one of those files, and I want that file to be able to import other files from that subtree, and I want to do this without running pip or any other thing that will "install" anything to any module search path
[08:22:36] <BrenBarn> what is the current best way to do this?
[08:22:52] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, manipulating sys.path, probably
[08:23:35] <cluelessperson> kuahara, I like web stuff and use the browser for forms.
[08:23:53] <cluelessperson> you get consistent look/feel across oses, and it's easy to make highly dynamic.

[08:26:38] <cluelessperson> BrenBarn, The database btw can take multiple forms:  you can present forms in the web server from premade files and store the answers per user.
[08:26:57] <cluelessperson> or you can actually build a database with say, postgresql sqlalchemy, or similar.
[08:27:08] <cluelessperson> BrenBarn, depends on how complex you want this

[08:27:36] <cluelessperson> BrenBarn, there may be some tools that do it automatically

[08:47:09] <BrenBarn> because thinking about things as files is nice and clear
[08:47:11] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, a directory with an __init__.py is a package. The other ways a package might exist depend on how you got there

[08:51:23] <SnoopJ> I'd be all in favor of a better way to import "that file over there" using importlib
[08:51:23] <BrenBarn> no, but I guess what I'm saying here is that I think it would be nice if Python allowed a simple "view" on the import system that may restrict your options somewhat in exchange for allowing simpler reasoning about things that are already represented in the filesystem
[08:51:49] <SnoopJ> yes, that much has been clear from the beginning
[08:51:57] <BrenBarn> i.e., just let relative imports work if they WOULD work if you considered the directory structure as the package structure
[08:51:59] <BrenBarn> like when you said before a package is a thing with a `__path__`

[08:53:48] <BrenBarn> so that you can tell just by looking at the directory listing what you can treat as a package and what you can't
[08:53:49] <BrenBarn> you could still cap it at any dir without an `__init__.py`
[08:54:04] <SnoopJ> yes, in exactly the same way that you can't tell if foo.py is just a module, or will be a namespace package
[08:54:36] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, why restrict it to regular packages, though? namespace packages are far more common to this "just make it work!1" user

[08:55:19] <BrenBarn> right, but what I'm saying is that I want a shortcut "concretion" in which that abstraction is represented directly as files and directories (which is already how it's effectively represented of the time, just with some support from the "install" mechanisms)
[08:55:19] <BrenBarn> don't know what what means?  the "cap it" thing?
[08:55:38] * SnoopJ can't make heads or tails of that
[08:55:55] <BrenBarn> really?  I always regarded namespaces packages as way more esoteric
[08:55:56] <SnoopJ> it sounds like you want to be able to at all times reference files relative to the one the module you're in came from
[08:56:39] <BrenBarn> of what?
[08:56:40] <BrenBarn> basically yes
[08:56:41] <SnoopJ> I don't really see why that needs anything more than some less cumbersome API in importlib, though.
[08:57:18] <BrenBarn> I'd be okay with an API in importlib if what it does is set things up so relative imports can work this way

[09:03:12] <BrenBarn> I don't really think this would break that much

[09:03:49] <SnoopJ> it seems more like you don't *care* about the breakages we've been discussing
[09:04:10] <SnoopJ> which is a fair perspective
[09:05:00] <BrenBarn> and the install process is basically just putting it in a certain place so that `python -m` can find it and thus connect it to the "conceptual" framework of packages

[09:05:28] <BrenBarn> that makes me wonder if I've made it clear that what I'm talking about is files on disk :-)
[09:05:29] <BrenBarn> what breakages are you talking about?
[09:05:36] * SnoopJ gestures at scrollback
[09:06:08] <BrenBarn> like that if you stick an `x.py` in some enclosing dir it could change the import behavior?
[09:06:19] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, re: how do you get to be in a package: someone else imports you
[09:06:23] <BrenBarn> I think most such breakages would be fixed by capping the directory-based package inference at any dir that doesn't have an `__init__.py`
[09:06:31] <BrenBarn> so if you do `from ......... import whatever` it will raise an ImportError if in traversing the parent directories it hits one that has no `__init__.py`
[09:06:32] <BrenBarn> rather than just go all the way to the root

[09:07:01] <BrenBarn> what if you are run from the command line?

[09:07:42] <SnoopJ> BrenBarn, then __package__ won't be set unless you do it for yourself (which is a thing you can do)

[12:16:10] <ravila> Hi all! I have a question on Python variable assignment syntax. What is the purpose of specifying the type as in `var_name : type = value`
[12:16:27] <llanhmod> Searching for pytest's log message levels, aka `log_level`, I only see INFO [https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/reference.html#confval-log_level] where to find the other options?
[12:16:32] <eoli3n> twb, we use a proxy, but we do not force it, outside proxy traffic is allowed
[12:16:42] <eoli3n> but at least I can try
[12:16:44] <eoli3n> two way
[12:16:47] <eoli3n> ways*
[12:17:02] <eoli3n> setting HTTP_PROXY, but will it use it for pip https ?
[12:17:07] <eoli3n> or using pip --proxy
[12:17:17] <eoli3n> lets try with the latter
[12:17:26] <twb> eoli3n: on Linux, at least, it's "http_proxy" -- lowercase
[12:17:36] <twb> But yeah I'd use --proxy if pip has that

[12:21:06] <jinsun> ravila: if you have a good IDE it will auto-complete better too if you specify the types
[12:21:12] <twb> eoli3n: or if INSIDE the chroot, you install libnss-resolve halfway through
[12:21:29] <twb> "resolveconf" would be another relevant package

[12:21:57] <eoli3n> what's strange is that all 'failing' hosts are starting downloading before failing
[12:22:35] <twb> eoli3n: my bet is the apt call immediately preceding broke dns inside the container

[17:43:40] <wyre> hi guys, I'm trying to parse a json from a GET request https://bpa.st/IEGA
[17:43:57] <pycode> datetime.now(pytz.utc)
[17:43:58] <wyre> but apparently the get() method is not returning the specified string when the Key is null
[17:44:00] <wyre> why is that?
[17:44:02] <pycode> i think my now() should be datetime.now(pytz.utc)
[17:44:30] <wyre> I'm having a concatenation error, because it cannot concatenate NoneType

[17:44:48] <wyre> but I'd say if "EndTime" is not found ... the get() method should return "Still recording?"
[17:44:50] <wyre> right?
[17:44:55] <pycode> Wooble, https://bpa.st/4NCA <--- i think it is ok
[17:44:59] <Wooble> pycode: the "best" way is probably pendulum.now("UTC").start_of("day").subtract(days=1).

[17:45:14] <pycode> oh using another library
[17:45:23] <Wooble> yes, datetime is garbage.
[17:45:31] <Yhg1s> wyre: JSON null becomes None, not a missing key. the default for dict.get is only used when the key is missing, not when the value is None.
[17:45:32] <bjs> wyre: is event a dict?

[17:45:49] <pycode> i think it should be UTC as weel
[17:45:49] <bjs> wyre: .get() only returns the default argument if the key doesn't exist, it's perfectly fine for the value to be None

[21:30:26] <bparker> does len() count bytes or characters though
[21:30:31] <Wooble> yes.
[21:30:33] <pycode> Wooble, pardon i am back
[21:30:33] <bjs> bparker: depends if you len() bytes or strings
[21:30:38] <pycode> you said
[21:30:43] <pycode> pendulum.now("UTC").start_of("day").subtract(days=1).
[21:30:50] <pycode> i said

[21:32:50] <Wooble> Guest92: the `len()` function is built in to python. you just call it.
[21:32:53] <bjs> Guest92: it didn't say you had to *write* a len function
[21:33:08] <Guest92> so how do you write it
[21:33:13] <Guest92> ?
[21:33:13] <bparker> len()
[21:33:14] <bjs> Guest92: you don't, it already exists
[21:33:26] <Guest92> so how does it tell you the number of charectors
[21:33:27] <bjs> Guest92: it just wants you to use it.
[21:33:36] <Guest92> ? how
[21:33:42] <bparker> len() is very complicated.
[21:33:43] <bjs> Guest92: have you seen https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings before?
[21:33:49] <bparker> depending on the encoding

[21:34:36] <bjs> Guest92: len() is a function that tells you how long something is.  For a string, it tells you how many characters are in the string.
