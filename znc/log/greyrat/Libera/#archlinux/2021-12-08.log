[03:11:20] <tonitch> Hey, Just noticed that in the select(2) there is a warning about the fact that poll(2) is better to use... is it in every application as in "select is deprecated" or is it still usefull in some case?

[03:11:37] <tonitch> tho maybe I should have asked that in #linux x)
[03:11:57] <raster> Gaboradon: honestly arch is not a problem - it has everything you need. you need to first ask - x11 or wayland (or both). note - you will probably explode complexity if you try do both.

[03:14:29] <tonitch> so, select it is! it's just that warning that is kinda implicitly telling that we should use poll from now on
[03:14:30] <raster> Gaboradon: if your goal is to do this for x11... then just install regular arch and get any wm/de you like running - it doesnt much matter. you then want xephyr (a nested xserver - xserver- in-a-window) and within this you can begin writing a wm... i might suggest you dont try write a wm first thing and just figure out how to write simple apps - create a window. draw to it, collect events... etc. - and then do this at the 
[03:14:31] <raster> xlib level if your goal is to do a wm

[03:16:50] <tonitch> nice! good to have insight :D thank you!
[03:16:54] <raster> in fact i have never had enough fd's to measure the difference (compared to all the other work the process is doing - filling the fd_set and scanning it for active fd's never turned up in a profile as any kind of item to even look at - that was beofre i added the epoll support)

[04:13:16] <raster> writing your own to get to the point of a de + a terminal would for you be many years of work. (given that you don't know how any of this works...)
[04:13:17] <rcf> Following the enlightenment approach, EFL is the toolkit, which is a library that deals with the X/Wayland bits so you don't have to do everything manually in your actual programs. 
[04:14:16] <Gaboradon> Exactly. In arch "main shell", you would install it, then run it, then it would open the whole DE up, one single executable, but ofcourse loading things from it's libs and datas, there might be a need for dependency if the way Linux it self forces me to do so, no way of knowhing now.

[04:15:19] <raster> you would install a de/wm - eg like enlightenment, or kde, or gnome, or lxde etc. ..

[04:15:47] <Gaboradon> The idea is to avoid relying on the way other projects think of existing DE's should be like, the way things are done.
[04:15:49] <rcf> I believe terminology supports loading arbitrary image files, not sure about sixel 
[04:16:06] <raster> in x you need an xserver (Xorg) that handles the screen and input devices and manages multiple processes sharing the same display and input devices.
[04:16:21] <rcf> Gaboradon: the problem is that programs expect you to follow at least some conventions. 
[04:16:38] <BrainDamage> sixels are a bit special, they need to be decoded to get the rgb data out
[04:16:41] <rcf> ICCCM for example. NOt that any person should be subjected to having to read that, but if you're writing a WM.... 
[04:16:47] <raster> BrainDamage: nope. it doesn't. it does support extended escapes for funtimes though :) i kind of draw the line at "if you are doing sixel you should be suing a display system anyway"
[04:16:48] <Gaboradon> Oh, the idea does not involve anything currently that any DE uses in any linux distro, unless someone got the same exact idea I had in some niche.
[04:17:22] <rcf> If you're writing a DE this is already not actually possible. 
[04:17:43] <raster> Gaboradon: so you need something like a login manager - mosty likely to launch the xserver and then star launching your wm and that then launches the rest

[04:19:22] <raster> what i do is just install slim (slim is a login manager). it starts x for me and then i configure it to auto-log in my user only with no password. i have a ~/.xinitrc file that just runs enlightenment_start - and enlightenment then does everything else for me from there. you could use other login managers too and they work in various ways - some will asupport /usr/share/xsession/*.desktop files and provide a gui to select 
[04:19:22] <raster> the session type you want from the available ones (enlightenment will install such a desktop file in that dir so its selectable too)
[04:19:28] <Gaboradon> rcf: Yes I forgot to add, it's a completely from scratch idea that needs program support, so when I said "to figure out how to make terminal work inside my custom DE" is that I'll probably have to write my own, but for a prototype, a few base apps might be enough to get the attentiona and perhaps people like the idea so much it continues into a more serious DE.

[04:23:48] <Gaboradon> raster: It's not about rewriting  whole software, but they would need to add support for this the way they had to for Wayland, that's my idea currently, it's all about sending signals and outputting data to an ELF executable, on Windows there's dev programs that have TCP / UDP pipes between processes when the main application sends work to workers for various jobs
[04:24:02] <raster> reality is the core principles are much the same between x and wl or drm when it comes to input and output - once you get to the right levels.
[04:24:50] <rcf> Crishack: nice
[04:25:23] <raster> but you first need to grapple with the idea that you have inputs - events like a key pressed or released, a mouse move event, mouse button press/release event, a window/region to draw in... and so on.

[04:58:26] <raster> the vt in the kernel will interpret bytes that arrive to a vt device (it's a file that gets bytes written to it - like a normal file on disk might, but instead of the file growing and getting bigger with those bytes appended, this special vt device eats up the bytes and interprets them)

[04:59:52] <raster> so if it sees a byte with "a" (ther ascii byte sequence for a) the kernels' vt emulator will set the current character cell grid value to "a" (that char value) then it will move the cursor position one to the right in the grid. if it now gets a "b" it will set that char grid cell to the value "b" and move cursor  one more to the right
[05:00:07] <raster> if it hits the end of s row it'll move the cursor back to the start of a row and go down one line
[05:00:55] <raster> he kernel will draw the changes to these cells to the screen by writing out the fonts as pixels (the kernel actually loads a font that is compiled in or supplied from userspace at some point)
[05:01:30] <Gaboradon> Interesting yes ... 
[05:01:34] <raster> there are special characters like the ESC (escape) character. it isnt drawn - it's the start of an "escape sequence". it is basically the start of a command to "change something"
[05:01:57] <raster> e.g. escape, then some series of characters after it that are a command - eg to change the foreground or background color
[05:01:58] <raster> etc.
[05:02:53] <raster> it gets more and more complex from there. special sequences for doing all sorts of things but the core idea is the terminal is a grid of character cells. every cell is the same size. each cell has some displayable state - a character to display, for handling colors a background and foreground color and so on...
[05:03:53] <raster> now what happens is some command - e.g. bash ( a shell) runs and uses this virtual terminal as the input/output for that process. all processes (ok - not quite true always but no need to nitpick here) start with 3 file descriptors.
[05:04:12] <raster> (once they hit their main() function where they parse their command-line arguments)
[05:04:57] <raster> they havd stdin, stdout and stderr. stdin reads input from the vt (the kernel will send bytes to this vt which sends it to the bash command). this will be your input- like when u press a and b and arrow keys etc. ...

[05:08:30] *** Joins: random-nick_ (~random-ni@87.116.181.93)
[05:08:53] <nothereisnotanam> its so complex that I think it should be scrapped, and a simple usinx socket should be used
[05:08:59] <raster> this is why i would not suggest you start trying to learn how a terminal works... at least how a kernel or userspace terminal emulator might work
[05:09:10] *** Joins: swalladge (~swalladge@user/swalladge)
[05:09:32] <raster> but as i suggested before - learn more basic stuff like how to render simple thigns and handle input... these are the basics you'd need if you ever want to write a terminal emulator of your own.
[05:09:39] <nothereisnotanam> it was designed for phisaical terminals, then mainframes, then puesodo terminals outputing to a terminal emulator like the frambuffer, and now for userspace terminals
[05:09:50] <raster> it's got years of legacy ugliness to it
[05:10:14] <raster> essentially the kenrle and a userspace terminal emulator actually partly emulate an old line printer 
[05:10:31] <nothereisnotanam> if you want to create a terminal, use libvte or xterm.js, the abstract away most of the complexity
[05:10:33] <raster> vt's originally on unix were a simpe line printer that would print a character and move the printer head around
[05:10:36] <Gaboradon> Many thanks indeed. Aha, yes you may be correct that I wouldn't need to know the full details of how the VT works nor the latter DE terminals/bash, but this overview definitely helps nontheless and is the first step that's actually necessary for me to see the lay of the land, overview.

[05:10:40] <raster> thats how output worked before screens...
[05:11:04] <raster> at its core basics it's a line printer that has over many decaes been extended and become much more complex with lots of legacy and ugliness.

[05:11:42] <nothereisnotanam> actually the line printer likeness was the only thing that was scraped, in favor of a grid of charecters
[05:11:54] <raster> you may even want to just leanr how ot write cmdline apps/tools that read stdin, write to stdout with nothing fancy like escapes.
[05:12:05] *** Quits: random-nickname (~random-ni@87.116.181.93) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:13:08] <raster> and now i finall have a cursor that is flat ... it's sleep time
[05:13:13] <nothereisnotanam> or make a program that reads and writes like a terminal to a socket
[05:13:16] <Gaboradon> So the first screen after install in Arch, is this VT, virtual terminal, correct? And it's only one and single, can only run one command at a time.
[05:13:36] <raster> Gaboradon: it can run many commands
[05:13:43] <raster> but there is only one of these - yes
[05:13:45] <nothereisnotanam> no, it displays output of shell
[05:13:56] <nothereisnotanam> which is the same as the one in userspace
[05:14:07] <raster> you can run multilpe commands and detach them like command1 &
[05:14:15] <Gaboradon> Ah okay, I guess I'll write this down, because now I already have a bunch of more specific questions that I couldn't have known previously, but yes it's late here too so we can continue next time.
[05:14:31] <raster> that wqill run command1 and intput will go to the shell which then goes to the vt
[05:14:40] <raster> but the shell will return to the prompt to run another command
[05:15:00] <raster> so command1 will run in the background and may even print output while it runs etc.

[05:15:40] <Gaboradon> The next thing I wondered, if reading text from vt is complex, the DE could read that file of bytes too, right?
[05:15:53] <raster> it can
[05:16:03] <raster> well wait
[05:16:07] <raster> it's not that simple
[05:16:29] <raster> if i get where you are going - that is not what you want to do
[05:16:48] <raster> a de might want to just run a temrinal emulator (like terminology, xterm, konsole etc.)

[05:17:10] *** Joins: almb1 (~Thunderbi@201.75.49.23)
[05:17:18] <raster> you could jusgt have a de launch a terminal emulator like the above "fullscreen"
[05:17:33] <raster> or have it display semi-transparently on top of other stuff...
[05:17:48] <raster> but its still a terminal emulator and its input and input is the vt and interpreted chars/escapes etc.
[05:18:22] <raster> i am semlling you want  to replace a normal mouse gui with clicking on things with something you type commands into that might eg move a window or launch a commands or log out etc. 
[05:18:24] <raster> right?
[05:18:32] <raster> or you are heading down this path...
[05:19:17] <raster> in which case you don't need a vt at all... you just need something that has a terminal-like input that seems to work like a terminal and interpret things you type as commands and then .. does things.
[05:19:29] *** almb1 is now known as almb
[05:20:05] <raster> but there is so much of "the devil is in the details" ... you need to be clear what you want - you probably just want to learn how htings work first so you know what to do later when you start doing what you want to do

I use systemd-resolved (and installed systemd-resolvconf), read the wiki page but cannot get it to work for firefox. It does work with dig, I get the right IPs and can connect via the IP, but not with
[19:57:08] <zoug> ping or firefox. How can I troubleshoot? I have the right info in /etc/resolvconf, my private DNS (lets say 192.168.1.30) as the first item, then backup dns servers (from the operator), then "search work.org". resolvectl status shows the right dns as the "Current DNS Server" and the right domain in "DNS Domain". Thanks a bunch!

[23:56:53] <Fabricio20> Hello, I'm having some issues with syslinux, during install everything seems to go fine but when I boot it just goes into PXE... my setup has two disks, sda/sdb, sda1 has syslinux (/boot) and sda2+sdb2 are soft raid1

[23:58:20] <Fabricio20> anyone has any clues as to what might be going on? It doesn't even look like it's trying syslinux.. sda1 (/boot) has the proper boot flag set, etc..
