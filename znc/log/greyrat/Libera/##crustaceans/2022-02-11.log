[00:17:00] <manicennui> 8% raise. Pretty much what I expected. Not as substantial as what was implied.
[00:18:25] <imode> beats inflation.
[00:19:21] <pja> manicennui: Congratulations, you get to keep up with inflation this year!
[00:19:39] <imode> I haven't kept up with inflation for the past two years.
[00:19:56] <imode> I'm effectively going to be asking for a 30% increase in base salary.
[00:22:24] <imode> which is really a 21.6% increase after compensating for inflation.
[00:22:48] <imode> divided by two years, it's 10.8% YoY.
[00:23:00] <imode> which should be the damn standard.
[00:24:20] <Geekingfrog> Why is that?
[00:24:42] <bkero> imode: you're below their minimum advertised salary. You need to *at least* be brought up to that
[00:25:43] <imode> yeah.
[00:25:50] <imode> $120k/yr.
[00:25:54] <companion_cube> right, so, seems like our tires have no one
[00:25:56] <companion_cube> but 3 nails in them
[00:26:04] <imode> companion_cube: do they happen to have magnets in them.
[00:26:09] <companion_cube> the joys of a construction site next door
[00:26:49] <companion_cube> we have a flat, and it seems the other tire that kept needing air has 2 nails in it
[00:27:00] <imode> damn.
[00:27:02] <companion_cube> it's :chef kiss:
[00:27:17] <imode> bkero: do you have a source for their minimum advertised salary?
[00:27:25] <imode> I make $120k/yr. position is an L5 syseng.
[00:27:41] <Geekingfrog> imode I heartily recommend a book called fearless salary negotiation.
[00:27:48] <imode> Geekingfrog: ohoho I am fearless.
[00:27:57] <imode> gib money.
[00:28:11] <Geekingfrog> It's fairly short, actionable, and I got pretty good results with it
[00:28:31] <imode> or I'll walk over to the senior SDET who wants to have my babies and have them up my comp with a new position, no on-call under the same org.
[00:31:46] <imode> everybody's going in a free-for-all direction right now and this is the time to be ballsy about getting what's yours.
[00:32:29] <imode> because 1. we aren't going to back to the office unless we choose to, 2. you just advertised a massive comp upgrade, 3. there is a massive turnover problem that needs to be addressed.
[00:36:58] <manicennui> imode: There were some Amazonians (I assume that is what you call yourselves) discussing comp in ##cooking yesterday.
[00:37:45] <imode> hah, really?
[00:37:47] <manicennui> Is it L7 that is extremely difficult to be promoted to?
[00:37:54] <imode> hell yeah it is.
[00:37:56] <imode> it's near the top of the org chart.
[00:38:04] <manicennui> Okay, so one of them is an L6.
[00:38:20] <manicennui> Sounded like he made a fuckton from stock.
[00:38:23] <imode> L7 is "works cross-org in-depth and manages a ton of shit".
[00:39:39] <manicennui> They made it seem like the base pay cap wasn't really $160k before.
[00:39:57] <imode> sure. you just get bonuses.
[00:40:02] <imode> or larger grants.
[00:40:31] <imode> I'm going to pursue an L6 promo in the next four years if I stick on.
[00:40:34] <imode> then an L7 after that.
[00:41:56] <bkero> imode: just the cnbc article that you posted
[00:42:09] <imode> ah yeah, that's the leverage for me right now.
[00:42:32] <imode> "I need $X to survive. you're already making adjustments, and I'm deploying one of the things that'll put myself out of a job."
[00:42:44] <imode> "along with at least 10 other people."
[00:44:30] <manicennui> Yeah, but have you considered how much the execs need to survive?!

[01:06:40] <gwozniak> So the "floating point doesn't work" bug was actually from an external customer.  This is done in Salesforce and us devs are deliberately not given access so we don't get flooded with help requests.  (This is a good thing.)
[01:07:20] <gwozniak> I got to see the issue in Salesforce.  Turns out the customer is using FreeRTOS and a static buffer, so...
[01:07:26] <gerikson> yeah we filter customer issues in SF too and only escaladte if needed
[01:07:28] <gwozniak> Interrupt issues, anyone?
[01:07:59] <gwozniak> It's always interrupts.  Especially with floating point, because saving the stack frame is messy
[01:08:35] <gerikson> ok wait, so you get information about the issue, but you don't get *that* infomatoin?
[01:08:51] <gwozniak> No.  the person who filed the bug did not report that part
[01:09:32] <gwozniak> Anyway, I've since proven there is no issue and apparently the customer figured it out: they didn't configure FreeRTOS for floating point correctly
[01:09:52] <gerikson> gwozniak: go have a word with that person
[01:09:58] <gerikson> jeez louise
[01:10:21] <gwozniak> I just had a 1-1 with my manager and this was discovered there
[01:10:45] <gwozniak> And -- surprise! -- the customer complained that we should document this behaviour, even though we have nothing to do with FreeRTOS
[01:13:36] <gwozniak> I said that I would appreciate better bug reports

[02:22:09] <manicennui> "The phrase was used to signify Thatcher's claim that the market economy is the best, right and only system that works, and that debate about this is over."
[02:24:38] <manicennui> "she argued that the market-principle of choice flows from the moral principle that for human behavior to be moral requires free choice by people."
[02:25:03] <manicennui> As long as that choice is her form of globalized capitalism.
[02:25:35] <imode> by definition morality is restricted choice.

[08:21:19] <manicennui> This is some top notch reporting.
[08:21:22] <manicennui> Not everyone is thrilled with “Ram Ranch” being adopted as the inspiration for the movement, though. Gennie, who tracks French- and English-language Zello and Telegram channels and goes by the name Resistance Cat — and also asked that her last name be withheld for her safety — thinks the song is funny, but is uncomfortable with many of MacDonald’s songs about black men, such as “Love My Black Bros” and
[08:21:22] <manicennui> “Black Cock Gang.” (MacDonald refutes this, saying such songs have been “misconstrued”: “Love and dignity and respect is what my music stands for,” he says.)

[17:08:34] <gwozniak> gerikson: I... almost need to read that slavery paper you posted
[17:10:35] <gerikson> it's very Poe's
[17:11:14] <gerikson> and weirdly, the author's name doesn't show up in Google apart from being the same as an obscure author of an antislavery pamphlet in the 18th century
[17:11:33] <gerikson> it's full of quotes by unrepentnig Southern slave apologists
[17:11:53] <gwozniak> The very beginning makes it feel like satire to me
[17:12:00] <gwozniak> But then again, it's hard to tell
[17:12:01] <gerikson> and ends with a society run by a dictator is fine acutally as long as everyone in the society is willing to live there

[18:03:18] <gerikson> well obviously, they are not risk takers
[18:03:26] <gerikson> sorry they are
[18:04:25] <gerikson> ``It would be far nearer the truth to say, “that some were born with sad­dles on their backs, and others booted and spurred to ride them.”''
[18:04:41] <gerikson> from aforementioned apologist of slavery Fitzhugh
[18:05:37] <gerikson> ``Fitzhugh differed from nearly all of his southern contemporaries by advocating a slavery that crossed racial boundaries. In 1860 Fitzhugh stated, "It is a libel on white men to say they are unfit for slavery" and suggested that if Yankees were caught young they could be trained, domesticated and civilized to make "faithful and valuable servants."''
[18:05:44] <gerikson> well that's all right then
[18:06:24] <companion_cube> oh lovely
[18:06:38] <gwozniak> logical idiocy
[18:06:44] <companion_cube> "the top race is clearly the southern white man, it just so happens that's me"
[18:45:36] <gwozniak> Anyone here use Tarsnap or rsync.net?  Wondering what the workflow is like for them
[18:45:54] <Xe> i use borgbackup with rsync.net
[18:46:15] <gwozniak> I mean, I can guess, but I'd appreciate someone with experience saying "it advertises as X, but is really Y"
[18:47:18] <gwozniak> Do you just rsync stuff, then?
[18:48:16] <gwozniak> I was reading Tarsnap's setup and it's a bit baroque.  Also, the pricing structure makes it hard to predict what it will be
[18:48:22] <companion_cube> I use borgbase
[18:51:20] <gwozniak> ``...we require it to compile success in all platforms.''
[18:51:33] <gwozniak> Sometimes those little English errors make me laugh
[18:52:11] <gwozniak> We have a "bug" that is really a team basically making us port their application for them
[18:59:06] <companion_cube> echo 'int main(){printf("ok\n");}' > success.c; gcc success.c
[18:59:08] <companion_cube> and you're done
[18:59:49] <gwozniak> `int main(void){}` is good enough for success
[19:00:41] <gwozniak> And standard compliant!
[19:00:42] * ben borg(matic) + rsync.net
[19:00:57] <gwozniak> Aside from the lack of newline at the end
[19:01:16] <companion_cube> :D
[19:01:24] <companion_cube> I always forget the (void)
[19:01:51] <riv> does it return 0?
[19:01:55] <gwozniak> Just '()' means the function can take any number of arguments (and not check them)
[19:02:02] <gwozniak> riv: yes
[19:02:20] <gwozniak> You don't need return 0 for main
[19:02:39] <gwozniak> I forget where is says it in the C standard, but it's there
[19:03:18] <gwozniak> One of those weird things to accommodate existing code when the standard came out, I think
[19:03:29] <companion_cube> :D damn, still
[19:03:47] <companion_cube> I think a few breaking changes every 10 years or so is… ok?
[19:03:53] <companion_cube> if they're easy to fix, that is
[19:05:30] <gwozniak> Section 5.1.2.2.3 of the C11 standard, for those that care
[19:05:57] <companion_cube> 5->1->2->2->3
[19:06:14] <riv> thanks
[19:06:47] <riv> wow its specific to main
[19:06:50] <riv> that's so random
[19:07:14] <gwozniak> Note that's for hosted environments
[19:07:54] <gwozniak> And main is special in C, so adding special cases for it is not really suprising
[19:08:15] <gwozniak> It's almost certainly to prevent code changes when the standard came out
[19:08:21] <riv> if I were in charge.. which I'm not
[19:08:31] <riv> I'd just make it an error (I know there's a -W flag for this)
[19:08:53] <gwozniak> That would piss off many people in charge of large code bases, I bet
[19:09:02] <gwozniak> Even adding warnings in C is a chore
[19:09:03] <riv> good >:3
[19:10:12] <gwozniak> C wasn't designed at all.  It grew out of over a decade of use.  C is a shitstorm and popular exactly because of this
[19:10:52] <riv> haha
[19:10:55] <gwozniak> And there's really no way to fix it aside from getting people to not use it
[19:11:37] <gwozniak> Some of our customers steadfastly refuse to change their code because it means going through long testing and certification processes that cost a lot of money
[19:11:51] <gwozniak> So they want the compiler changed instead
[19:12:07] <riv> that hits my malcompliance meter hard
[19:12:46] <gwozniak> Don't kid yourself into thinking that doing things "the right way" will ever work at large scale any time soon
[19:13:33] <gwozniak> Even if everyone starts using Rust, or Haskell, or whatever, those forces will be exerted and the languages will change to accommodate them
[19:14:35] <Geekingfrog> That's depressing
[19:15:03] <riv> .oof
[19:15:14] <riv> "we use rust" grep unsafe, 543534 resulst
[19:18:09] <Geekingfrog> you can easily put this number down by making the unsafe block a lot bigger instead of on each line
[19:19:07] <riv> haha

[19:35:26] <gerikson> yeah I kinda knew about all that stuff (except the bonkers Aarhus) but he ties it together really well
[19:38:12] <Brekkjern> Yeah. It's mostly a warning similar to the "Things you didn't know about names" kind of posts
[19:38:31] <Brekkjern> But more towards how complex the concept of text and its meaning is
[19:42:02] <manicennui> Rust also doesn't solve most security problems. It solves a specific class of problems. It would not have done shit for log4j.
[19:42:21] <riv> i think log4j happened because of .class code loading?
[19:42:32] <manicennui> log4j did exactly what it was designed to do.
[19:42:38] <companion_cube> manicennui: log4j couldn't have happened
[19:42:44] <manicennui> What it was designed to do was ridiculous.
[19:42:55] <riv> i dont think log4j is a good example here
[19:43:00] <edk> i think it is
[19:43:06] <edk> there wasn't any memory safety problem in sight
[19:43:14] <ngoldbaum> i’m not sure that “most security problems” aren’t UB exploits that rust fixes
[19:43:15] <riv> rust doesn't have .class loading
[19:43:18] <companion_cube> If rust solves only 70% of the vulnerabilities, we're making progress
[19:43:25] <edk> rust doesn't have .classes
[19:43:33] <companion_cube> (the buffer overflow ones)
[19:43:36] <ngoldbaum> guess it depends on what you mean by “most”
[19:43:42] <manicennui> 70% of security issues aren't memory issues.
[19:43:53] <riv> where are these numbers from?
[19:43:57] <edk> but it absolutely is possible to write code that downloads arbitrary code from a server and executes it
[19:44:00] <ngoldbaum> our asses
[19:44:12] <companion_cube> manicennui: in C they are
[19:45:06] <companion_cube> (according to Microsoft and google iirc?)
[19:45:08] <manicennui> Sure.
[19:45:27] <manicennui> But rewriting all C in Rust doesn't magically make everything secure.
[19:45:46] <manicennui> I'm not advocating continuing to use C.
[19:45:53] <manicennui> I just wish people used a bit of nuance with the Rust nonsense.
[19:46:01] <manicennui> It's like everything else with devs.
[19:46:01] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[19:46:14] <companion_cube> Not saying "everything", just 70% less issues
[19:46:17] <manicennui> Everything is a silver bullet.
[19:46:21] <manicennui> companion_cube: In C.
[19:46:24] <manicennui> Not in software.
[19:46:35] <riv> rust vs c is a different comparison to rust vs java
[19:46:35] <buttsbot> >Can bitcoin, if rewritten in rust, cure loneliness?
[19:46:50] <companion_cube> Well, you should use rust where you'd normally use C
[19:47:00] <companion_cube> If you can use java, use java
[19:47:06] <companion_cube> I think it's pretty clear at this point
[19:47:18] <manicennui> I don't think it is clear to most people in our profession.
[19:48:05] <companion_cube> Well there's a lot of places where C is still used :p
[19:48:28] <manicennui> No one is disputing that.
[19:48:43] <manicennui> The vast majority of us use C indirectly.
[19:49:24] <companion_cube> So it makes sense to push rust in many places, is my point
[19:49:32] <edk> the places where it's relevant that C is used tend also to be the places where it's hard to replace
[19:49:41] <manicennui> companion_cube: How much C do you write each month?
[19:49:44] <edk> also, probably mostly C++ at this point
[19:49:48] <companion_cube> I don't, thankfully
[19:49:50] <edk> rust was invented to write browsers in
[19:49:52] <manicennui> companion_cube: That is my point.
[19:49:56] <manicennui> Who are we pushing?
[19:49:59] <manicennui> gwozniak?
[19:50:08] <companion_cube> Oh, no one
[19:50:31] <companion_cube> People who still write C seem to like it
[19:50:33] <edk> well, judging by the way rust people talk about rust i think most of them have never written C seriously
[19:50:39] <riv> what's put you on this track manicennui ?
[19:50:42] <edk> yes, C is nice to write
[19:50:54] <ngoldbaum> for what it’s worth, apple cut new releases of all their OSes yesterday to fic a critical security issue in webkit caused by C memorty unsafety
[19:51:00] <ngoldbaum> just one data point…
[19:51:11] <edk> webkit is c++
[19:51:14] <companion_cube> edk: yikes :p
[19:51:38] <edk> rust is designed to be appealing to c++ programmers and it's sort of inevitable that that means it's not going to be very appealing to people who prefer C imo
[19:51:54] <manicennui> Again, no one is claiming that there aren't security problems in C, that there isn't a lot of C out there, or that memory problems aren't one of the main causes of concern in C.
[19:51:56] <companion_cube> Also people are getting more and more used to high level conveniences, the sort C just doesn't provide
[19:52:11] <companion_cube> In that sense rust appeals to a wider audience than C
[19:52:12] <manicennui> But you are preaching to a bunch of people who don't do manual memory management.
[19:52:21] <manicennui> About what some other hypothetical group of people should do.
[19:52:29] <edk> it appeals to a *different* audience than C, that's the problem
[19:53:07] <companion_cube> manicennui: every body might have a use case for that at some point though
[19:53:10] <riv> "memory problems aren't one of the main causes of concern in C." I think that is not true
[19:53:25] <riv> I think that memory corruption is the #1 problem in C programming
[19:53:28] <manicennui> riv: "no one is claiming"
[19:53:31] <manicennui> Read it again.
[19:53:32] <companion_cube> riv: you missed a negation
[19:53:44] <companion_cube> edk: yeah and hopefully the C audience is shrinking
[19:53:51] <riv> oh okay
[19:54:15] <companion_cube> At some point it'll be only greybeards and unix fetishists like ddevault
[19:54:27] <edk> in the same way that it's nice when natural languages that aren't as fit as english die?
[19:54:40] <companion_cube> (who's making his own C because he's been spoiled by go)
[19:54:58] <companion_cube> edk: natural languages aren't comparable :/
[19:55:06] <ngoldbaum> did you just compare extinction of programming languages to exctinction of human languages?
[19:55:08] <ngoldbaum> wat
[19:55:09] <edk> well now you're trying to make C sound worse by associating it with someone who isn't even really associated with it
[19:55:17] <companion_cube> :D
[19:55:20] <ngoldbaum> we are losing C’s cultural heritage guys
[19:55:37] <companion_cube> I mentioned a prime unix fetishist is all
[19:56:20] <edk> i don't think it is
[19:57:49] <riv> im not really sure what point was being made
[19:58:07] <riv> is rust good/bad? is it being pushed too much/not enough? does it replace C or not?
[19:58:09] <companion_cube> My point is that C is going to become mostly a lifetime choice
[19:58:26] <companion_cube> Lifestyle
[19:58:29] <edk> rust does replace C in most cases, it's just not a very nice replacement
[19:58:37] <companion_cube> Lol my phone is in the pocket of big rust
[19:59:01] <companion_cube> edk: I think most people who are not unix veterans will strongly disagree
[19:59:18] <manicennui> Living the C lifestyle...
[19:59:54] <manicennui> companion_cube: I think once you eliminate people who don't actually write C for a living, opinions become far less one sided.
[20:00:27] <edk> don't get me wrong, i think it's great that rust exists, and it's objectively better to write new things in it than in C
[20:00:27] <riv> yeah there's a lot of people with no skin in the game telling people what to do
[20:00:31] <edk> but it's just... *horrible*
[20:00:31] <riv> as usual on the internet
[20:00:53] <companion_cube> Yeah it's bad to tell other people to riir
[20:00:56] <riv> what don't you like about rust?
[20:00:56] <buttsbot> >I told a coworker about lobste.rs, and futilely tried to convince him that it isn't HN for Rust
[20:01:20] <companion_cube> edk: the question is whether it's less horrible than C :)
[20:01:23] <edk> it's hard to articulate, but basically all the same things i don't like about C++, plus the fact that its package ecosystem is just node
[20:02:30] <edk> it's very complicated; ownership is not a good model for lots of things; lots of emphasis on "zero-cost" abstractions which really just externalize the costs by forcing certain design choices on you
[20:02:58] <epilys> curious what it's not a good model for? (honest question)
[20:03:11] <riv> double linked lists /trollface
[20:03:13] <companion_cube> Intrusive linked lists
[20:03:30] <epilys> you can use an arena with identifiers
[20:03:39] <edk> linked lists that thread into other datastructures are an obvious one
[20:03:42] <epilys> I implemented a kdtree like that
[20:03:45] <companion_cube> riv: tbh you can write these using unsafe and provide a safe API if you wish
[20:04:01] <manicennui> I would not want to maintain a large piece of software in Rust.
[20:04:14] <epilys> you can also use safe rust with Rc or RefCell, theone with the Weak references

[20:05:08] <riv> > its package ecosystem is just node
[20:05:10] <riv> well that spooks me
[20:05:12] <riv> i don't like that at all
[20:05:21] <manicennui> The large monorepo I work on is one of the easiest things at the company to work on once you learn it.
[20:05:23] <companion_cube> it's just code for "there's a nice package manager", riv.
[20:05:24] <edk> another thing that's close to my heart is IRC, where users and channels both need to be able to get owning references to each other
[20:05:33] <manicennui> The smaller services are a nightmare.
[20:05:36] <riv> we're really screwing up with the code/library repos online
[20:05:37] <edk> the package manager is... fine i guess
[20:05:46] <edk> the dependency trees for any serious rust program are not
[20:05:50] <epilys> It's spooky but I don't know what's a better alternative except for more convenient choose of the central repository (instead of crates.io)
[20:05:53] <riv> "everyone can just dump anything here" has been found to not work
[20:06:12] <companion_cube> as opposed to vendoring stuff like in C?
[20:06:14] <riv> unfortunately we need people to actually curate libraries
[20:06:17] <companion_cube> I'm always surprised by this take
[20:06:24] <companion_cube> like, if you hate libraries, say so
[20:06:25] <ngoldbaum> dependencies are fine actually
[20:06:26] <riv> which is a huge amount of effort that nobody seems to want to do
[20:06:26] <edk> mostly in C depending on things is so hard that nobody does
[20:06:32] <manicennui> I don't understand the complaints about crates.
[20:06:39] <companion_cube> yeah so you reinvent the wheel every time, edk
[20:06:41] <epilys> companion_cube, rewrite the dependency... NIH etc :D
[20:06:44] <companion_cube> I'm guilty of that too, but damn
[20:06:53] <edk> it's not the worst place in the world to be
[20:07:02] <companion_cube> depends on whether you want to be productive or not
[20:07:02] <edk> having a batteries-included standard library would be better
[20:07:09] <companion_cube> perfectionnism is bad on that
[20:07:23] <companion_cube> or like, NIH-ism, because you want things exactly your way
[20:07:27] <epilys> I like that rust-lang team on github has crates they support but not include in the stdlib
[20:07:31] <edk> it's not about wanting things exactly any way
[20:07:33] <companion_cube> (and I'm annoyed because that's exactly me)
[20:07:37] <manicennui> Crates and cargo are two of the things that I like most about Rust, along with the Result type.
[20:08:01] <edk> my issue with the giant dependency trees is that i think they're supply-chain attacks waiting to happen
[20:08:11] <riv> yes
[20:08:46] <companion_cube> there's lockfiles; and otherwise, sure, but the only way to avoid this is to rewrite everything yourself
[20:08:53] <companion_cube> including locks, crypto, etc. which is really impractical
[20:08:54] <manicennui> People oppose the solution to that though.
[20:08:57] <edk> i don't think lockfiles are a solution to anything
[20:09:01] <manicennui> Because geeks are paranoid little dorks.
[20:09:29] <edk> they could be if you reviewd the diffs every time you updated anything
[20:09:31] <manicennui> The solution isn't to trust random git repos.
[20:09:43] <manicennui> So I don't even know what you want to happen.
[20:09:44] <riv> surely someone *else* has reviewed the diffs
[20:09:56] <edk> there's no reason for them to
[20:10:03] <edk> manicennui: i don't understand what straw man you're currently tearing down
[20:10:15] <companion_cube> edk: I don't understand what solution you're advocating for
[20:10:25] <riv> I am the one proposing a solution
[20:10:25] <manicennui> edk: What is an example of how you think dependencies should be done.
[20:10:32] <manicennui> Yes, what companion_cube said.
[20:10:33] <edk> questions end in question marks, manicennui
[20:10:44] <manicennui> edk: Really?
[20:10:50] <epilys> it'd be totally awesome if updating your dependencies could show you list of commits and diffs if you want
[20:10:53] <riv> it's called 'batteries' and it's a website with a small number of carefully selected high quality libraries that all work together and get updated often
[20:11:00] <edk> make standard library big; make adding dependencies feels like it costs something
[20:11:15] <companion_cube> big will never contain everything
[20:11:35] <companion_cube> does the stdlib need to contain sqlite and a http client/server?
[20:11:44] <edk> it doesn't need to contain everything, it just needs a critical mass of stuff so that you can depend on a few carefully vetted libraries without accidentally pulling in the universe
[20:11:53] <edk> it probably should contain those two things yes
[20:12:03] <manicennui> The JDK probably has the biggest standard library, and it is only a fraction of what everyone uses.
[20:12:19] <companion_cube> but then you'll invariably have a better http client/server as a 3rd party
[20:12:23] <companion_cube> (see: python)
[20:12:27] <edk> that's absolutely fine
[20:12:30] <companion_cube> so then you use a crappier one just because
[20:12:36] <edk> also requests is so totally not better than urllib2
[20:12:38] <manicennui> companion_cube: That is the case in every single language pretty much.
[20:12:42] <manicennui> Other than maybe Go.
[20:12:46] <edk> it's marketed better
[20:13:03] <manicennui> But there are probably http libraries for Go that use the standard library and add a few things.
[20:13:47] <companion_cube> manicennui: neither Haskell nor OCaml have standard http{c,d}, nor sqlite
[20:13:48] <manicennui> So probably everything.
[20:13:49] <companion_cube> for example.
[20:13:53] <companion_cube> neither does C++
[20:13:56] <manicennui> companion_cube: Sure.
[20:14:01] <companion_cube> Go doesn't have sqlite
[20:14:02] <manicennui> But I meant for language that do.
[20:14:13] <companion_cube> ah, well, yes
[20:14:14] <manicennui> There is always a better 3rd party library.
[20:14:30] <companion_cube> having a large stdlib means it's lower quality than the ecosystem, that's rust's postulate
[20:14:35] <manicennui> Java has gone through years of replacing their standard library because of this.
[20:14:45] <manicennui> I think the date library has been rewritten twice.
[20:14:46] <companion_cube> and it makes sense: even rust's Lock is not as good as parking_lot
[20:14:52] <companion_cube> and that's with a pretty lean stdlib
[20:15:00] <edk> that's not really a problem imo
[20:15:27] <manicennui> edk: It also doesn't solve the problem that you described.
[20:15:31] <edk> also parking_lot's lock claims to be fair, iirc, which is not an unambiguously good thing
[20:15:47] <manicennui> If every project uses some third-party library, why does it matter that the standard library includes an implementation that no one uses?
[20:16:44] <edk> i don't think every project should use some third-party library; i think the stdlib versions of things should be good enough most of the time
[20:16:57] <manicennui> And no one writes Java beyond college assignments that pulls in nothing.
[20:17:07] <edk> yes, and enterprise java sucsk
[20:17:08] <edk> or sucks
[20:17:12] <manicennui> Every Java project pulls in dozens of libraries, even with the JDK's huge standard library.
[20:17:18] <riv> I don't think the divide between stdlib/external libs is really the important thing
[20:17:20] <manicennui> It has nothing to do with "enterprise java".
[20:17:30] <riv> the important thing is having high quality code available, that doesn't get malware'd
[20:17:30] <edk> i'm not sure if java's standard library is really what i'd call huge
[20:17:31] <companion_cube> manicennui: what does it matter to have a large stdlib, if you pull stuff from 3rd party anyway?
[20:18:01] <manicennui> The only way the large standard library solves any real problems is if the language is used in a very focused domain, and you can cover most of what is needed.
[20:18:06] <manicennui> Not for a general purpose language.
[20:18:15] <edk> i think that's just manifestly untrue
[20:18:37] <edk> python's large standard library is enough for me to do pretty much anything i want

[20:18:46] <manicennui> You don't connect to databases?

[20:19:05] <manicennui> companion_cube: Which is great for test.
[20:19:05] <riv> python has a web server
[20:19:17] <edk> but i'm also not arguing that nobody should ever depend on anything at all
[20:19:17] <riv> python -m http.server

[20:19:25] <riv> really cool tool

[20:19:37] <riv> bam. you got a directory hosted on http
[20:19:39] <riv> 0 fuss
[20:19:43] <companion_cube> edk: "small" just means you have bigger libraries
[20:19:52] <manicennui> riv: And no one runs shit in production that way.
[20:19:57] <edk> companion_cube: and/or that they lean on the stdlib for more things
[20:19:58] <manicennui> It doesn't help the case we are discussing.
[20:20:04] <edk> companion_cube: i'd be happy with that
[20:20:11] <manicennui> It is exactly the thing we pointed out. Everyone is going to use a third-party library.
[20:20:15] <companion_cube> edk: I mean in python, yes
[20:20:20] <manicennui> The fact that Python can do it means nothing.
[20:20:20] <companion_cube> but we're talking about rust vs C
[20:20:22] <riv> production?
[20:20:26] <companion_cube> so, well, that's a gap
[20:20:58] <edk> i'm just pointing to python as an example of a language where i can get shit done without pulling in 100 transitive dependencies
[20:21:32] <manicennui> Basic sys admin stuff perhaps.
[20:21:51] <edk> C is another example of such a language, but in a much more annoying way, because POSIX is ambiently available and libraries usually don't have very many dependencies of their own
[20:22:06] <manicennui> Python is also one of the worst examples for dependency management, seeing as it has like 3 bad options.
[20:22:12] <riv> posix affects everythings stdlib (unfortunately)
[20:22:15] <riv> ocaml, rust etc.
[20:22:19] <edk> manicennui: that aren't at all relevant

[21:38:03] <gerikson> Bellamy salute - I know about this
[21:38:09] <gerikson> which is kinda weird
[21:38:21] <gerikson> also the Finnish armed forces used the swastika too
[21:38:28] <manicennui> Did you practice it?
[21:38:40] <manicennui> You obviously can't learn about it without practicing it with a large group.
[21:38:50] <gerikson> also chanting
[21:38:53] <gerikson> U S A
[21:39:00] <gerikson> M A G A
[21:39:05] <gerikson> T R U M P
[21:39:27] <gerikson> saluting the flag is some bullshit
[21:40:00] <manicennui> All of the flag worship in the US is bullshit.
[21:40:06] <companion_cube> eslint should have a coin slot into which you insert bitcoins

[21:40:48] <manicennui> companion_cube: If you read the thread, they are considering some kind of donation thing.
[21:41:05] <manicennui> Were
[21:41:10] <manicennui> I just realized that this is from 2019
[21:41:53] <manicennui> They did decide to use Open Cellective.
[21:41:54] <manicennui> https://opencollective.com/eslint
[21:41:56] <buttsbot> ESLint - Open Collective
[21:42:24] <manicennui> $240k per year to sustain development of a linter?
[21:44:11] <kline> damn
[21:44:15] <kline> wish libera got that amount
[21:45:20] <kline> that said, 250k is like 2-4 full time developers
[21:45:57] <kline> so its very feasible to use that much if they are actually running full time devs, which given the churn in javascript is entirely possible to need that many people for a linter
[21:46:09] <ngoldbaum> with benefits? more like 1.5, maybe
[21:46:11] <kline> this is a Bad Thing that its possible, but that says more about js
[21:46:18] <ngoldbaum> at US rates anyway
[21:53:08] <manicennui> Looks like it is basically being run like a not-for-profit.
[21:53:43] <manicennui> The guy from the tweet makes a few hundred per month. The guy doing most of the work these days makes a couple grand a month. They paid $10k in December for a new website...
[21:54:14] <manicennui> There are expenses for Google GSuite.
[21:54:21] <imode> twitter borked.
[21:54:48] <manicennui> Bunch of other random people making several hundred per month for contributions.
[21:56:08] <manicennui> Oh, $10k was just in December for the website. There is another $7.5k in November.
[21:56:31] <manicennui> And $20k in October...
[21:57:34] <imode> apparently russia's invasion is "imminent".
[21:58:37] <imode> fuck russia.
[21:59:01] * manicennui wonders how much side money he could make contributing to open source projects that accept sponsorships.
[21:59:04] <companion_cube> paying 10k for a free software project's website, woah
[21:59:14] <companion_cube> I mean, good for them.
[21:59:19] <manicennui> companion_cube: Just in December. Looks like almost $40k overall.
[21:59:46] <imode> we need to pay people for crucial software.
[21:59:47] <manicennui> companion_cube: It seems odd to me, for a linter.
[21:59:58] <imode> ESLint is pretty crucial to a lot of people's workflows.
[22:00:00] <manicennui> But hey, whatever.
[22:00:09] <imode> you write a linter, manicennui. :P
[22:00:21] <manicennui> imode: $40k isn't for the linter.
[22:00:22] <imode> it's a pretty complex one.
[22:00:29] <imode> what's $40k for, then.
[22:00:34] <manicennui> The website.
[22:00:42] <manicennui> They did a redesign in the fall.
[22:00:49] <imode> how much money was for the redesign.
[22:00:54] <manicennui> $40k
[22:01:06] <imode> was that paid internally?
[22:01:07] <manicennui> The overall pool is much larger.
[22:01:11] <companion_cube> it's impressive that people place that much importance to a linter
[22:01:24] <manicennui> imode: What is "internal" when it comes to an open source project?
[22:01:54] <manicennui> Here is one of the expenses: https://opencollective.com/eslint/expenses/52410
[22:01:56] <buttsbot> New Brand and Website Design · Expense #52410 - Open Collective
[22:02:19] <imode> here's my blind faith argument. this thing doesn't have a backing organization and is widely used. it doesn't have a coherent organization, just some contributors who do some of the work and some who do most of the work.
[22:02:41] <manicennui> imode: I don't have any specific criticism. Just seems odd, but also interesting.
[22:02:42] <imode> people putting in work deserve pay for that work.
[22:02:57] <imode> if someone designed the website, they should be paid for it.
[22:03:21] <manicennui> imode: I think people should do whatever they like, but I also don't think open source works if people only do it if they get paid.
[22:03:45] <imode> there's two incentives. you do something that benefits you, or you gain something from doing things that benefit others.
[22:04:12] <imode> you can do open source for either, but the latter is how you get this.
[22:04:31] <imode> and iirc ESLint is present like.. everywhere.
[22:04:50] <imode> like, everywhere everywhere.
[22:06:30] <imode> it is pretty interesting what they're pulling in, $40k for a website redesign and new branding seems excessive but I don't know who bid for that, and that site hosts a lot of documentation.
[22:06:33] <manicennui> It's interesting because this sort of thing is far less common in the Ruby world.
[22:06:48] <imode> I wonder why that is..
[22:06:57] <manicennui> imode: I think there were three different people who collected for the website.
[22:07:13] <imode> that makes sense, and I imagine that also included testing and new infra.
[22:07:21] <manicennui> Seems like maybe one person did the initial brand redesign and such, then another person did a bunch of work, and another did some graphics.
[22:07:22] <imode> maybe some new CI/CD or something.
[22:07:33] <imode> that's $13.3k/person, then.
[22:08:01] <imode> which imo is pretty low for a total overhaul if you're working on it for months on end.
[22:08:09] <ngoldbaum> https://twitter.com/nickschifrin/status/1492203844155150339
[22:08:10] <buttsbot> Twitter - nickschifrin - NEW: The US believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, and has communicated that decision to...
[22:08:15] <imode> how long did it take them, I wonder.
[22:08:33] <imode> if it took them four months, that's $3k/mo.
[22:08:39] <imode> per person.
[22:08:45] <imode> not even counting operational expenses.
[22:09:48] <imode> ngoldbaum: if it happens, I guess we're not doing anything about it. is the UK still over there?
[22:12:08] <companion_cube> manicennui: maybe there's just less money in the ruby world
[22:12:19] <manicennui> companion_cube: Nah.
[22:12:22] <companion_cube> like it's probably orders of magnitudes smaller than js
[22:12:42] <manicennui> companion_cube: Pretty much every big tech company still has some Ruby somewhere.
[22:12:52] <manicennui> And several of them still have large chunks of their site in Ruby.
[22:13:07] <manicennui> By pure numbers JS is obviously larger.
[22:13:27] <manicennui> Ruby just isn't hyped anymore.
[22:13:35] <companion_cube> "some ruby" is an easy target
[22:13:53] <companion_cube> but do google or facebook have a non trivial amount of ruby?
[22:13:59] <manicennui> Almost certainly.
[22:14:00] <companion_cube> (compared to, say, Haskell, D, etc.)
[22:14:11] <companion_cube> I thought google allowed only python, for example
[22:14:15] <manicennui> Nah.
[22:14:30] <manicennui> They definitely have a lot of C/C++ and Java too.
[22:14:35] <manicennui> And Go.
[22:14:36] <companion_cube> (and FB has php, of course)
[22:14:40] <companion_cube> I meant as a scripting language
[22:14:54] <manicennui> Ugh
[22:15:02] <manicennui> Are we going to argue about what a "scripting language" is now?
[22:15:12] <companion_cube> no, but python and ruby are in the same bucket
[22:15:16] <manicennui> A significant portion of YT is Python still.
[22:15:19] <companion_cube> yes
[22:15:19] <manicennui> It is not for "scripting".
[22:15:25] <companion_cube> come on
[22:15:43] <companion_cube> I just mean that I doubt people are allowed to use ruby at google, when python is the recommended dynamic language
[22:16:02] <companion_cube> dynamic object oriented interpreted language blablablabla if you want.
[22:16:12] <manicennui> I'd be willing to bet money that there are dozens of small Rails apps all over Google.
[22:16:17] <manicennui> I know there are at Amazon.
[22:16:24] <manicennui> And Twitter.
[22:16:36] <manicennui> Shopify is mainly Ruby.
[22:17:12] <manicennui> There is a stupid amount of Ruby in finance.
[22:18:22] <imode> yeah but how many ruby projects hold the ruby ecosystem together.
[22:18:33] <imode> that's not a dismissive, that's a genuine question.
[22:18:45] <manicennui> imode: Rails, rspec, and rubocop are obviously used extensively.
[22:18:55] <manicennui> Doesn't even look like rspec has any kind of donation mechanism.
[22:18:56] <companion_cube> yeah, shopify and github are the big users I know of
[22:19:03] <manicennui> And rubocop seems to have a small amount of money.
[22:19:26] <imode> are the core developers backed by large organizations/companies, then?
[22:19:30] <manicennui> companion_cube: The amount of Ruby at Amazon dwarfs most companies' entire code bases.
[22:19:30] <imode> like, were they poached/hired.
[22:19:39] <imode> yeeeeah.
[22:19:46] <imode> we make incredibly heavy use of it.
[22:19:52] <imode> that and Java.
[22:19:57] <companion_cube> good to know, I thought amazon was mostly java
[22:20:10] <manicennui> I think a lot of the Ruby at Amazon is internal apps.
[22:21:28] <imode> some of it makes it to the front end.
[22:21:34] <imode> but yeah, a LOT of internal apps.
[22:21:55] <manicennui> I bet there is still a big chunk of Perl too.
[22:22:12] <imode> https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0
[22:22:13] <buttsbot> Amazon's Build System · GitHub
[22:22:15] <manicennui> Might be more on the retail side.
[22:22:35] <imode> oh god no, it's super ingrained.
[22:22:43] <imode> all of this is accurate to a point.
[22:22:49] <imode> there are some changes being made.
[22:23:03] <manicennui> "The build system ensures that nothing is depended upon besides GCC/Glibc, and your explicitly listed dependencies, by ensuring nothing else is on your linker line / classpath / PERL5LIB / whatever for your language."
[22:23:06] <manicennui> Yay! Perl!
[22:23:41] <manicennui> "The main build driver is a mess 'o Perl scripts that generate makefiles."
[22:23:56] <manicennui> companion_cube: You also have Chef and Puppet still used all over.
[22:24:08] <manicennui> Although Puppet has rewritten a bunch of their Ruby.
[22:24:30] <companion_cube> not saying ruby isn't used
[22:24:37] <companion_cube> but JS is huge in comparison
[22:25:44] * manicennui took a JS this morning.
[22:27:35] <gerikson> imode: what military assistance does the world owe Ukraine?
[22:27:47] <gerikson> AFAIK it's not part of any security network
[22:27:49] <manicennui> Owe is not the right word.
[22:27:55] <companion_cube> gerikson: a lot actually, since apparently they relinquished their nukes on promise of protection
[22:27:58] <manicennui> Many countries have interests in the Ukraine.
[22:28:08] <companion_cube> they must be livid about that one
[22:28:15] <gerikson> companion_cube: that agreement wasn't worth the paper it was written on
[22:28:28] <gerikson> nothing binding
[22:28:46] <companion_cube> maybe so, but still, it's a shitty situation
[22:29:01] <manicennui> https://usa.mfa.gov.ua/en/ukraine-and-usa/trade-and-economy
[22:29:02] <buttsbot> Trade and Economy | Embassy of Ukraine in the United States of America
[22:29:07] <gerikson> Russia would *love* to crush not only the Ukrainian military but also any foreign troops
[22:29:09] <companion_cube> not like "binding" means anything in international relations anyway.
[22:29:18] <gerikson> Realpolitik
[22:29:25] <manicennui> The keystone of Ukrainian exports to the United States were ferrous metals and articles (61.4%), fats and oils of animal or vegetable origin (5.7%), ores, slags and ashes (4.8%), nuclear reactors and boilers (2.6%), machinery, electrical machinery (2.3%) and aircraft (2.1%).
[22:29:28] <gerikson> at least the US has a prez that won't roll over without a fight
[22:29:32] <gerikson> Trump would have
[22:29:32] <edk> why will it stop with ukraine?
[22:29:58] <manicennui> What is the Republican position on this? Just oppose whatever Biden decides to do?
[22:30:18] <gerikson> because apart from Belarus, most of the other former Warsaw pact countries are NATO members
[22:30:21] <imode> gerikson: didn't say that anybody owed Ukraine anything.
[22:30:27] <gerikson> Belarus is next
[22:30:41] <edk> belarus doesn't need to be invaded
[22:30:47] <gerikson> manicennui: pretty sure the natsec mafia is still strong
[22:30:51] <gerikson> newp
[22:31:02] <manicennui> It does seem like preventing all countries from invading other countries might be a good position these days though. I don't know.
[22:31:08] <imode> yeah.
[22:31:14] <imode> except we've been doing that shit for decades.
[22:31:23] <manicennui> Yeah.
[22:31:23] <imode> who stopped us.
[22:31:27] <manicennui> Who can?
[22:31:27] <gerikson> might makes right
[22:31:45] <imode> there's a simpler view of this, though, that people have the right to govern themselves.
[22:31:55] <imode> and not be invaded/killed.
[22:31:56] <companion_cube> what about separatists, imode?
[22:32:02] <companion_cube> e.g. Kosovo
[22:32:03] <manicennui> imode: That was kind of my point.
[22:32:11] <manicennui> imode: The past is done. Accept current borders.
[22:32:24] <manicennui> Prevent any new invasions.
[22:32:24] <edk> and don't let anyone become independent ever?
[22:32:30] <manicennui> But yeah, our behavior makes this harder.
[22:32:34] <gerikson> imode: btu Russia does *not* accept that Ukraine has a right to self-determination
[22:32:45] <imode> sure. so someone should stop that.
[22:32:45] <edk> well obviously
[22:32:46] <manicennui> edk: Breaking off from a country is different from invasion.
[22:33:17] <manicennui> Doing so non-violently is tough though.
[22:34:04] <edk> i think it's unlikely that NATO means much to anyone these days
[22:34:56] <edk> also apart from it being a strategic concession it also just seems kinda bullshit to promise ukraine things and then go back on them and say "haha you shouldn't have believed us"
[22:35:49] <imode> that's canonically termed as a "dick move".
[22:35:53] <edk> yeah
[22:37:18] <gerikson> agree
[22:42:48] <manicennui> Half my team is upset about their raises. Yay!
[22:43:01] <imode> oh boy.
[22:44:03] <ngoldbaum> hard for management to go from basically zero inflation their whole career to %7.5
[22:44:26] <ngoldbaum> the table that tells them how to do raises that was established in 2014 doesn’t make sense anymore
[22:45:19] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: It didn't help that we just had our quarterly meeting, and the CEO went on and on about how great we are doing, record this and that, and specifically called out that the merit pool is almost double what it has been in the past.
[22:45:26] <manicennui> Then people get pretty average raises.
[22:45:38] <manicennui> That they are below inflation just makes it even worse.
[22:48:42] <manicennui> Oh, anti-vaxx guy is no longer employed by us.
[22:48:46] <manicennui> Wonder what happened.
[22:48:56] <manicennui> "I heard he just up and left. Just stopped logging in and told nobody"
[22:48:58] <manicennui> Interesting.
[22:53:03] <gerikson> mah humblebrag weekend, let me show you it https://lobste.rs/s/m3pirs/what_are_you_doing_this_weekend#c_m1wyp4
[22:53:03] <buttsbot> What are you doing this weekend? | Lobsters
[22:53:49] <imode> sounds like life is going nice for them.
[22:54:12] <imode> we're going to the zoo this weekend, and having a superbowl party, of which I'll probably be sitting around thinking about my side projects.
[22:54:36] <imode> trying to acclimate back to normal life now that cases have fallen off a cliff.
[22:55:25] <manicennui> You are the first person I've seen mention the superbowl on either IRC or at work.
[22:55:46] <imode> probably a good thing. dad and brother in law are football fans.
[22:55:53] <imode> dad's a lion's fan though.
[22:57:04] <manicennui> We need some kind of competitive team-based programming event with different languages competing.
[22:57:16] <manicennui> Imagine the drama and hatred.
[22:57:26] <manicennui> We'd probably make sportsball fans look tame.
[22:57:35] <companion_cube> like, the ICFP competition?
[22:57:40] <imode> is that heated?
[22:57:50] <imode> I want people bodyslamming other people over the choice of spaces vs. tabs.
[22:57:58] <companion_cube> ah you mean IRL ? :D
[22:58:04] <imode> fuck yeah I mean IRL.
[22:58:10] <manicennui> companion_cube: I mean like esports, but programming.
[22:58:17] <imode> let's see if an MMA fighter can write fizzbuzz.
[22:58:22] <manicennui> In an arena.
