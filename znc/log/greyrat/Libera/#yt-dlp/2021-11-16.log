[04:56:59] <cow_2001> huh
[04:57:31] <cow_2001> oh no
[04:57:38] <cow_2001> what happened to youtube-dl
[06:38:14] <opal> development went inactive there
[06:38:36] <opal> nothing really happened just maintainers too busy
[06:38:55] <opal> fork helped things along

[07:30:31] <donofrio> they say I should ask this here - help why is this video being throttled and how do I work around it so it downloads at full speed? https://dpaste.org/kHcY
[07:37:57] <donofrio> ah that is better ;)
[07:39:03] <cow_2001> how did you fix it
[07:39:16] <cow_2001> it's a new piece of software, this yt-dlp
[07:39:32] <cow_2001> https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
[07:39:41] <cow_2001> i don't know anything about throttling
[07:47:58] <donofrio> yep it worked awesomely

[12:47:57] <ede> cow_2001: yt is throttling for months already. yt-dlp found a workaround.
[16:50:43] <opal> is there a workaround for twitch prerolls or is that just streamlink doing that for now
