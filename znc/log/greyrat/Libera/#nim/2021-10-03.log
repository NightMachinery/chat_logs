[06:04:42] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> it's certainly possible, you'll just need to set up some form of interprocess communication like a FIFO pipe

[18:29:32] <Mister_Magister> oh esp32 you say?
[18:29:39] <Mister_Magister> i was talking about that with fren recently
[18:42:43] <FromDiscord> <dom96> so I think Nim might have some problems being statically linked with musl. I believe this was the source of these bugs: https://github.com/dom96/choosenim/issues/257
[18:43:05] <FromDiscord> <dom96> or maybe it was statically linked openssl
[19:13:33] <FromDiscord> <tandy> oh nice, are you gonna make a library for that?↵(@dom96)
[19:13:50] <FromDiscord> <tandy> i wanted to write some firmware for the AirGradient with Nim maybe
[19:14:48] <FromDiscord> <dom96> maybe eventually, my focus is on the project so the code I'm writing is quite specific to it
[19:14:56] <FromDiscord> <dom96> there is actually an esp library in Nim by someone else though

[19:28:37] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> Or, more specifially, if I have a repo that needs to build C/C++ libraries and then run nim is that something available?
[19:28:43] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> exactly

[19:29:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @krux02 "<@459174286104461312>: CMake is horrible": i can attest to that lmfao

[19:29:37] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> I'm loving nim but getting the other team members onboard means the git pull and build which I cannot figure out atm
[19:29:39] <krux02> no I was actually not here
[19:29:50] <krux02> I am not often here anymore
[19:29:58] <FromDiscord> <Rika> well that is unfortunate
[19:30:08] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> In reply to @krux02 "best thing is if": does that go in a nim-script file
[19:30:40] <FromDiscord> <dom96> you just put it in the module where you wrap the C/++ code
[19:30:40] <krux02> zentoad: no just in a normal Nim source file
[19:30:57] <FromDiscord> <tandy> oh neat↵(@dom96)
[19:31:05] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> Ahh, ok.
[19:31:28] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> I figures because it's a crazy windows lib/dll will tons of dependencies this would be tricky
[19:31:37] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> figured

[19:34:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> nim generating C files is actually a huge problem, cmake has to know all it's inputs at the same time

[19:36:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> haha funnyu↵(@Recruit_main707)
[19:36:32] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> it has to glob files that exist at configuration time
[19:36:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and nim generates file as a part of build process
[19:37:10] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> In reply to @haxscramper "haha funnyu (<@386230567571554305>)": This was my original problem, I downloaded nimgl but it didn't actually compile on windows.  And I ended up down a rabbit hole
[19:37:38] <krux02> haxscramper, build once, glob, build again
[19:37:52] <krux02> the generates files don't magically disappear
[19:38:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> this would require multistaged cmake etc.

[19:38:54] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> I usually have a hand written .bat file
[19:38:54] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `add_custom_target` works fine in theory, you just have to delegate build to nim fully
[19:39:01] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> which might be the right solution
[19:39:09] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> but for supporting different OS this isn't sustainable

[22:36:28] <FromDiscord> <retkid> dont blame me this is just he way its delivered to me
[22:37:30] <FromDiscord> <retkid> you cant do "json["hits"]["hits"]{"field"}
[22:37:33] <FromDiscord> <retkid> (edit) ""json["hits"]["hits"]{"field"}" => ""json["hits"]["hits"]{"field"}""
[22:40:02] <FromDiscord> <zidsal> Can you send us the actual json string as that's not valid json!
[22:41:21] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @retkid as zidsal said, this is not valid JSON
[22:41:31] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> in JSON all keys are quoted
[22:41:33] <FromDiscord> <retkid> grabbing some valid jason
[22:41:39] <FromDiscord> <zidsal> Thanks ret
[22:43:22] <FromDiscord> <retkid> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3AKj
[22:43:50] <FromDiscord> <retkid> (edit) "https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3AKj" => "https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3AKk"
[22:44:09] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> `data["hits"]["hits"]`
[22:44:10] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> will be your array
[22:44:14] <FromDiscord> <retkid> yea
[22:44:22] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> so what's the issue?
[22:44:28] <FromDiscord> <retkid> but if i try to go to "total" it returns an assertion issue
[22:44:36] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> because you should do data["hits"]
[22:44:38] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> (edit) "because you should do data["hits"] ... " 03added "for total"
[22:44:56] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> the JSON you sent is↵↵hits -> (total, max_score, hits -> [array of hits])
[22:44:59] <FromDiscord> <zidsal> Just to check are you using the inbuilt Json library or the other one that people use ( can't remember the name!)
[22:45:04] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> no
[22:45:08] <FromDiscord> <retkid> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3AKl
[22:45:09] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> check the JSON you have again
[22:45:12] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> "total" is inside the first "hits"
[22:45:20] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> so you just do jsonObject["hits"]["total"]
[22:45:26] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> .getInt()
[22:45:30] <FromDiscord> <retkid> it is
[22:45:41] <FromDiscord> <retkid> oh wait sorry, im looking for _score
[22:45:43] <FromDiscord> <retkid> i meant to say
[22:46:01] <FromDiscord> <retkid> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=
[22:46:03] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> well to get the score of a _first_ hit you need jsonObj["hits"]["hits"][0]["_score"]
[22:46:10] <FromDiscord> <retkid> AHHH
[22:46:11] <FromDiscord> <retkid> ok
[22:46:14] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> it's an array
[22:46:17] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you need to index into it
[22:46:28] <FromDiscord> <retkid> yea it returns an iterable array
[22:46:32] <FromDiscord> <retkid> cool
[22:46:49] <FromDiscord> <retkid> thank you <3
[22:47:29] <FromDiscord> <retkid> i thought it would return just a mush of strings and i would need a function to turn it into an array
[22:47:43] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> it parses the _whole_ JSON object
[22:47:46] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> not just some part of it
[22:48:12] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> after you do parseJson you don't have the original json string data at all, you have a tree of `JsonNode`s
[22:48:54] <FromDiscord> <retkid> that is very useful to keep in mind
[22:48:57] <FromDiscord> <retkid> thank
[22:48:58] <FromDiscord> <retkid> (edit) "thank" => "thanks"
[22:52:06] <FromDiscord> <retkid> of all the trials and tribulations this is the thing i needed help with
[22:52:07] <FromDiscord> <retkid> lol
[22:52:21] <FromDiscord> <retkid> (edit) "of all the trials and tribulations ... this" 03added "I've been threw this week,"
