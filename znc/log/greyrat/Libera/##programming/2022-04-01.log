[00:02:37] <BASHitup> This is all under the assumption that a person can afford a lawyer. 
[00:02:56] <BASHitup> There is a video I was going to put on my website, but I don't know if it's legal. 
[00:03:00] <BASHitup> Yet, I cannot afford a lawyer. 
[00:03:00] <ElderMalaclypse> It's also *remarkably* difficult to find a lawyer to review your license.
[00:03:13] <ElderMalaclypse> stupidly difficult
[00:03:44] <ElderMalaclypse> The way you get a lawyer to review a license is generally even more expensive than you'd thing, because most of them ghost people who want them to review an open source license.
[00:03:46] <flaqoniun> why was this video so controversial?
[00:03:49] <ElderMalaclypse> . . . so you have to trap them.
[00:04:14] <BASHitup> Yes, it would be nice if most lawyers had the mindset of Erin Brockovich. 
[00:04:15] <ElderMalaclypse> You can pay a lawyer's retainer for more general purposes that will (unbeknownst to the lawyer, perhaps) also cover license reviews.

[00:06:56] <ElderMalaclypse> The sharks wouldn't eat the doctors because they stank so badly (from kickbacks).  They wouldn't eat the politicans because they were so dirty.  They wouldn't eat the lawyers out of professional courtesy.

[00:25:49] <vdamewood> If you change the license, then it's a different license and the FSF (and the community at large) don't want the license to be rendered ineffective due to a proliferation of variant licenses.

[03:44:20] <bomb> Flutter is BAE
[03:44:30] <sonny> beaky: what's a database frontend?
[03:44:47] <beaky> a database frontend is like the query language stuff
[03:45:09] <sonny> oh, any ideas yet?
[03:45:15] <vdamewood> sonny: Well, in SmallTalk-style OOP, objects are entirely defined by their messages. Whatever 'values' they store are implementation details that you're not supposed to think about.
[03:45:28] <sonny> I implemented a trie too, it's the ultimate data structure
[03:45:34] <beaky> i will send tea queries like 'get teas from last week' and it will turn that to the trie retrieval commands
[03:45:44] <pulse> the ultimate data structure is skiplist
[03:46:00] <beaky> nice i have to try skiplist too i think there is a library of it in rust

[03:48:28] <sonny> vdamewood: yeah
[03:48:53] <vdamewood> A try is what happens when you run to the end of the field in rugby.
[03:49:45] <sonny> nomagno: a tree where the number of child nodes vary at each level
[03:49:55] <sonny> something like that
[03:49:57] <beaky> a trie is a data structure where each node's child is indexed by a single symbol from an alphabet (unlike binary search trees where you have a left and right child)

[04:06:23] <sonny> the npm situation is messy I do agree

[04:06:47] <beaky> rewrite the world in rust
[04:07:33] <BASHitup> I need to learn kubernetes. I have used docker but not kubernetes 
[04:07:51] <Sqaure> Rust is unnecessary low level 
[04:07:55] <BASHitup> I only don't like docker because much of it isn't persistent automatically.

[04:08:24] <Sqaure> sonny, was that for me?
[04:08:27] <sonny> all the languages you mentioned are in the same class
[04:08:29] <sonny> yeah
[04:09:23] <Sqaure> Rust doesnt have a GC right. Doesnt it require developer to handle memory deallocation?

[04:09:57] <beaky> rust has no gc but it has a borrow checker so it will make sure all memory is safely handled
[04:10:22] <nomagno> Rust has essentially no manual memory manipulation capabilities unless you enter the spooky unsafe mode
[04:10:43] <Sqaure> oh well. I guess its a candidate too. I doubt it has the expressiveness of haskell though. The more constraints you can give your types is always better.
[04:10:45] <nomagno> It doesn't even have proper pointers FFS. O get it's, like, necessary to ensure safety

[04:11:42] <beaky> pointers are cache unfriendly anyway so i try to avoid them
[04:11:53] <sonny> because of invalidation?
[04:12:04] <sonny> or something
[04:12:19] <beaky> yes for each pointer you have to jump a lot in ram and that puts a load in memory
[04:12:25] <sonny> ah right

[05:04:16] <vdamewood> A machine word is (usually) the size the CPU is designed to work with, often the size of a register. Sometimes systems can handle larger values, albeit slower.
[05:05:38] <vdamewood> Some CPUs, especially extensions to older cpUs, will have multiple word sizes. the x96_64 line has WORDs (16-bits), DWORDs (32-bits), and QWORDS (64-bits).

[05:07:39] <vdamewood> Also, the x86_64 CPU is an extension to an extension, so it has 3 word sizes.
[05:08:16] <vdamewood> Though, a CPU that's designed to be 64-bits from the start, might have 'half words' or other fractions.

[07:11:37] <bayaz> Title: Inotify script to trigger a command on file changes, e.g. rsync 
[07:12:54] <Macbethwin> you want to create events for when files are 'accessed' or tainted /tampered.   I have thought of this: I don't want any device/peripheral/process user, to scavenge and settings in /etc       but I have thought of a solution to at least obscure the contents of some configuration files     
[07:13:08] <sonny> vendor lock in is annoying because, I don't want to help them migrate either 
[07:13:08] <Macbethwin> like /etc/resolv.conf may have lines that #_cryptographichashedstring  that may be the DNS resolving /tls configuration and failover servers    that may be only accessed by the Augmented Secure Terminal (console)
[07:13:29] <BASHitup> K ... So this is the goal: I simply want to know if or when someone is lurking and trying to exfiltrate data from my machine or is doing anything devious behind the scenes. 
[07:13:44] <BASHitup> There are SEIMs
[07:13:46] <BASHitup> That's obvious 
[07:13:54] <BASHitup> And NIPS and HIDS etc 
[07:14:08] <BASHitup> Yet, those are comprehensive systems and I'm looking for something more monolithic. 
[07:14:15] <Macbethwin> my scheme also prevents contents that are microhashed to be fenced off communication channels - even in a de-correlation scheme visually
[07:14:43] <BASHitup> K, I need to talk to one of you one-on-one if that's even an option? 
[07:14:55] <BASHitup> So I can ask question and not distract from the conversation flow. 
[07:14:55] <flaqoniun> consider this though, if they could modify e.g. a root file, they might be able to disable the watch on file too
[07:15:15] <Macbethwin> I imagined a secure HID setup but USB etc is way too complex for me to investigate if this is even feasible or possible

[07:16:50] <Macbethwin> (in this time)
[07:16:50] <sonny> I don't know the names
[07:17:08] <sonny> one of them made mirage OS
[07:17:27] <sonny> it's stuff like unikernels and user space networking
[07:18:07] <sonny> google is making one

[07:18:41] <Macbethwin> >> companies would benefit *now* if there are any efforts made to have OS readiness to build a new generation of cryptographic routines, hashing    in the vincinity that both time and spatial complexity is narrowing in the post-quantum era
[07:18:50] <flaqoniun> is that new though?
[07:19:03] <flaqoniun> they've been working on that for ages
[07:19:30] <sonny> well they are using it in prod now
[07:19:36] <Macbethwin> us gov isnt doing very much besides NIST its a effort that is much broader
[07:20:25] <sonny> oh folks seem to be working on quatum era crypto
[07:20:37] <sonny> I even talked to someone in ##math who was doing it
[07:21:50] <sonny> there's probably more interest in that than os research
[07:21:58] <Macbethwin> I'm only talking about it but I have some ideas that may or may not aid

[15:13:45] <PlanckWalk> If the angle goes past pi/2 then the point of intersection with the tangent line is negative - in the sense that it is to the left of the tangency point instead of right.
[15:14:17] <PlanckWalk> And so on if you keep increasing the angle: at pi it touches at the tangency point again and so on round and round.
[15:15:39] <PlanckWalk> It's undefined at odd multiples of pi/2 since the line through the center doesn't intersect the tangent line is those cases.
[15:15:59] <PlanckWalk> in* those cases.
[15:16:43] <PlanckWalk> You can think of them as "intersecting at infinity", and even make that rigorous with suitable mathematical structures like projective geometry.

[22:28:20] <[itchyjunk]> flaqoniun, 0.
[22:28:23] <koollman> [itchyjunk]: sorry, I'm apparently very sarcastic currently. But, basically you'll often need to explain your motivations
[22:28:34] <koollman> beyond the obvious "I need money for food and rent"

[22:29:14] <koollman> obviously it is a perfect moment for bullshit
[22:29:19] <[itchyjunk]> What are some good answers?
[22:30:11] <EdFletcher> Honesty is always the best policy when getting a job. If you’re not and they find out, it ranges from dwelt uncomfortable to immediately unemployed. 
[22:30:15] <koollman> you like what they do, or what you'll do, you want to discover this new thing, or you know it already and like it, or ...

[22:30:57] <[itchyjunk]> Their pipeline involves sql. I've used mysql a tiny bit a decade ago.
[22:31:00] <koollman> it's easier to explain a true thing, but don't feel limited to that :)

[22:31:14] <koollman> depends if you are
[22:31:38] <[itchyjunk]> Well, i don't remember much of it. but i could google and figure out the basics in a day or 10.
[22:31:39] <koollman> you can lie (in my opinion) about many things, but saying you know something that you do not can really end badly and quickly

[22:53:23] <sonny> alycidyne: interesting, so you created this method to protect memory access using software
[22:53:25] <ProfSimm> alycidyne: others systems are very entangled with arbitrary memory addressing
[22:53:25] <sonny> that's neat
[22:53:37] <alycidyne> sonny: the difference is that security models are often defined on different levels, in different models

[23:00:22] <ProfSimm> alycidyne: it's nested command buffers that fold left, if I can sum it up. But it adds up to a language where you can create other languages as DSLs, embedded into a relatively uniform and flexible syntax
[23:00:38] <alycidyne> Gamah: ah, you can do ios::sync_with_stdio(false) if you're writing to stdout

[23:03:01] <oldlaptop> Gamah: One thing to think about: what should happen if the I/O operation fails for some reason? How bad is it for a file to be half-written? (as would be more likely if you're not firing it all out at once at the end)

[23:10:52] <alycidyne> Ideally, the drivers would be part of the runtime system, as a lib which you simply link to to talk to the device
[23:10:57] <sonny> I don't know much about storage hardware tbh
[23:11:20] <sonny> and don't you have to make the API?

[23:12:03] <alycidyne> sonny: I keep arriving more and more at the conclusion that circuit engineers simply can't be programmers
[23:12:16] <ProfSimm> alycidyne: the problem is not realizing everything is procedures, because it already is. Messages are sent, they run procedures. The problem is uniform interfaces. It's hard to get everyone to agree on those.
[23:12:33] <alycidyne> ProfSimm: correct
[23:13:03] <sonny> that just isn't possible

[23:22:34] <sonny> ProfSimm: that's been done already, objects, files etc
[23:22:58] <alycidyne> ProfSimm: for example, I thought of a system where a device interrupts another by writing a pointer to a memory-mapped register which, normally, would cause the target device to read from where the pointer points to
[23:23:32] <alycidyne> ProfSimm: so, doing so to a CPU would cause it to start execution from a new location (with optional extra processing for, for example, saving the current context)
[23:23:34] <ProfSimm> alycidyne: sharing memory address space seems like a flaw
[23:23:56] <alycidyne> ProfSimm: well it must happen at some point
[23:24:16] <ProfSimm> alycidyne: it must happen at a point that resides in a trust hypervisor. I don't think it should happen at any point

[23:50:40] <oldlaptop> vultr will give you a public IPv4 address and (more than) enough machine behind it to run a low-traffic static website for US$3.50/month

[23:51:25] <teut> so it looks like it just it shows the programmer that there are addresses which are "overwritable"
[23:51:27] <oldlaptop> of course then you need to take care of DNS too, either run it yourself or get someone to do it for you (often the same place you use as a registrar will run authoritative dns for you)
[23:51:31] <teut> is that correct?
[23:52:06] <oldlaptop> bomb: I wonder if it's still too soon to make flaming data center jokes.

[23:52:40] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: I think I'm looking for web hosting this time, it usually comes with email hosting
[23:52:44] <kee> teut: Sort of?
[23:52:49] <kee> There's more to it, like memory maps and stuff.
[23:53:01] *** Joins: brabrax (~brabrax@user/brabrax)
[23:53:18] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: You can run your own email off a cheap VPS too if you like. :P

[23:53:49] <oldlaptop> on the one hand you have to take care of administering and managing it yourself, on the other hand you get to take care of administering and managing it yourself
[23:53:55] *** Quits: vitali64 (~vitali64@user/vitali64) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[23:54:19] <teut> ya, but that can be abstracted wrt the thing I was asking
[23:54:27] <teut> thanks for clearing my confusion kee
[23:54:38] <oldlaptop> (email is actually relatively likely to be trouble with VPS providers, because spam. vultr for example doesn't leave port 25 open by default, although I'm told they will happily open it up for you on request)

[23:57:05] <sonny> didn't vultr prices go up?
[23:57:24] <sonny> I use vultr, it takes like 10 minutes to get a server with you service of choice
[23:57:33] <sonny> s/you/your/
[23:57:41] <oldlaptop> I haven't kept track. They did make one major change at the bottom end a while ago, the US$2.50/month VM doesn't get a public IPv4 address anymore
[23:57:50] <oldlaptop> (i.e. they charge a whole extra US$1/month for that)
[23:58:01] <oldlaptop> given the state of things, that's probably reasonable :(
[23:58:35] <sonny> it's still odd to me you can't use ipv6 addresses in the browser
[23:58:36] <davros> $3.50/month with how much storage
[23:58:48] <oldlaptop> davros: 20G, IIRC.
[23:59:08] <oldlaptop> (and one vCPU and something like 256M of RAM. It's a budget VPS, for sure.)
[23:59:09] <sonny> it's like the vbox default
[23:59:23] <davros> 256m/ram is a bit limiting probably
[23:59:25] <pyzozord> I had vultr before the cheapest one, and scans were taking 20-30% of my bandwidth
[23:59:27] <sonny> 1024m
[23:59:46] <oldlaptop> It's more than enough for a low-traffic static website
