[01:50:54] <Aeres> django-doh: import os, os.getpid() -> write it to a file in /var/run/process.pid and when you want to kill it, you can kill it
[01:51:09] <Aeres> this is something similar to what daemonizer does too, a bit hacky though I think
[01:51:19] <django-doh> Aeres that's nice idea, I like that. At least it would be somehow reliable.
[01:51:20] <Elw3> Eg i have a lua cpu metering, so ln lua metering and then metering code.lua shows this as metering in top instead lua.

[03:03:20] <Codaraxis> I asked a similar question here a while back and one interesting thought I hadn't considered was that, even if a user comes back, they won't reactivate their original account. They'll make a new account since the new user is, in a sense, a new entity whose roles, permissions, etc. should be determined anew

[03:09:31] <Codaraxis> I should probably also start tracking users' workareas. In addition to the obvious of their home directory, every project is on its own volume with its own work area root under which users make individual work areas. There are also a couple scratch volumes. So, they tend to have files scattered across the network

[04:35:43] <krumelmonster> I need some advice concerning privilege escalation. I want to be able to do very specific tasks on a very well secured system from within a less secure system. For example there is an OpenWrt wifi router and a webserver. I want to allow anyone to change the wifi password by sending a REST-API request to the server

[04:37:33] <krumelmonster> Here's a solution I'm sceptical of: I create an unprivileged linux user account on the wifi router but also a script `setpassword.sh NEWPASSWORD`. I allow the user to run this script with sudo
[04:38:18] <krumelmonster> the webserver can access the wifi router as this new unprivileged user through ssh

[04:46:22] <krumelmonster> good point. I will configure the wifi router using uci but I should first of all not use the cli ans instead libuci (C but python bindings exist)
[04:47:07] <arrcpp0> Or use cli, but call that using python (skipping the shell)

[06:31:45] <humanBird> usually you just provide the address of the "external" ip to the ssh command and it figures it out. but in this case, i'm not sure how this would be set up? does it have to be different ports on each machine and you use ssh commmand with -p option?
[06:31:56] <ayecee> usually by forwarding different external ports to the internal machines.
[06:32:32] <ayecee> or by running an ssh server on the box doing the nat, and using that as a jump box to the other two
[06:32:50] <ablyss> its not like you're running two sshd servers on one IP/machine.

[06:51:37] <hamburger> but well since ipv6 already out what to do
[06:51:45] <hamburger> just use ipv6 than
[06:51:49] <ayecee> tomreyn: the clients would need ipv6 addresses.
[06:51:52] <hamburger> but the kernel is stupid
[06:51:57] <ayecee> tomreyn: they don't have ipv6 addresses.
[06:51:57] <tomreyn> sure
[06:52:02] <hamburger> you need alot of route layer and that sutff
[06:52:05] <hamburger> stuff
[06:52:07] <tomreyn> oh they don't? i must have missed that

[06:53:17] <hamburger> that's all

[06:53:24] <hamburger> you can remove it of course
[06:53:30] <ayecee> tomreyn: it's not though.
[06:53:31] <hamburger> but the lan will not work anymore
[06:53:39] <hamburger> you will have access to direct ip
[06:53:44] <hamburger> which is so nice
[06:53:52] <hamburger> improve alot of performance
[06:53:58] <tomreyn> it is here, but certainly not everywhere
[06:54:00] <humanBird> the work involved in getting rid of ipv4 seems infeasibly large.
[06:54:03] <hamburger> but well you can design it to hit all ip
[06:54:06] <hamburger> that
[06:54:16] <hamburger> that's why they choose forward port to connect

[06:54:35] <hamburger> you can use something like this

[11:50:10] <Masklin> If a process is stuck, and refuses to die even though I kill it with pid, what do I do?
[11:50:34] <dirtyflag> kill -9 pid   does not work ?
[11:50:53] <dirtyflag> generally, is a buggy app
[11:51:12] <Masklin> Does not work
[11:51:16] <CuriosTiger> If kill -9 won't work, that's a zombied process and AFAIK the only fix is a reboot.
[11:51:20] <Masklin> It's rsync, so doubt it's a bug
[11:51:25] <dirtyflag> yes, reboot
[11:51:32] <Masklin> brr
[11:51:34] <CuriosTiger> Most likely, some underlying file system call is stuck.
[11:51:42] <NyB> Masklin: in ps, do you see a D or a Z right next to the process?

[11:53:47] <pnbeast> Gotta have that mother and child reunion.  It's just a reboot away.
[11:54:03] <CuriosTiger> That system call will never return, and so the rsync process will never be able to clean up and exit.
[11:54:13] <Masklin> Bummer
[11:54:18] <Masklin> So reboot, then.
[11:54:19] <Masklin> Sad.

[15:09:45] <Mrokii> Hello. I have a failing internal hard drive (ext4, not an ssd, one partition) which first went into read-mode, then, after a reboot didn't show any partitions. Testdisk couldn't find it either. I have a replacement drive meanwhile, but I'm wondering if ddrescue is the best tool to try to recover files. Are there any other, better suited tools, if no partition can be found?

[17:46:10] <purpux> Hey all. I just compiled the new 5.17.1 kernel, and there is a new AMD P-state driver... upon enabling it, I find some strange behaviour in my Ryzen CPU. Clock speeds at idle are around 400 MHz where are before they were around 1400 MHz. Of course, I don't mind this, and it seems to be boosting to higher frequencies than before
[17:46:49] <purpux> But I have a few questions about it: 1. How does it work ? 2. My temperatures at idle seem to be about the same... I would assume a lower clock means lower temperatures. Am I wrong ?
[17:46:56] <ioria> varaindemian, i suggest you try some other pkg format or another browser (not snap) :  https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/x11-connection-rejected-because-of-wrong-authentication/16528/5

[18:22:02] <purpux> BCMM: what does that mean ?
[18:22:05] <BCMM> i.e. it's junction temperature + a fixed value, used to compensate for difference between models

[18:24:26] <purpux> peetaur: eh.. maybe ? I think you might have caught it at a point where the CPU might have been scaling back, but the heatspreader might still be sending heat to the cooler above. I think you Tdie should be real tho

[18:28:04] <BCMM> you're not supposed to read T_control to judge if cooling is working. it's just used to control fan policy, and their way of having it work differently on different CPUs is to just add an offset to the value
[18:28:20] <peetaur> skefljut_blerimi: I abandoned tumbleweed when they merged factory into it long ago...it was unusably unstable combined with systemd being so buggy

[18:56:55] <peetaur> (and arch based really is quite fine if you know what you're doing)
[18:57:05] <stasp> Never actually tried it though because the installer isn't blind friendly.

[18:57:27] <dj1ns> stastp, not working
[18:57:29] <dTal> I have strong negative opinions on Arch but I have used up my flame quotient for the day
[18:57:34] <MrElendig> fedora is pretty damn good these days, except for their horrible installer
[18:57:59] * dTal gets back to trying to get work done, despite exercerable tooling in the free software world
[18:58:02] <peetaur> is it the same as the centos one? that thing is awful; sometimes it's so crashy you have to just accept defaults and fix it after with a rescue boot
[18:58:29] * MrElendig have found fedora to be more stable than centos on any modern hardware

[18:59:25] <dj1ns> stasp, cant disable WDefender, the service still running
[18:59:39] <MrElendig> fedora installer does let you partition as you like

[18:59:45] <peetaur> MrElendig: I haven't found centos to even be ever unstable...unless you mean a package in the EPEL repo which can be really awful
[18:59:52] <MrElendig> (it just have a horrible UI, is slow as fuck and buggy)
[19:00:43] <dirtyflag> dTal: tell me what OS supports all this arch; https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch
[19:00:44] <MrElendig> peetaur: old kernel and mesa == forget about using a new amd card :p

[19:01:02] <peetaur> do you know what I mean about centos? you can define sizes and what they do, etc. but maybe it'll end up putting your 5.8TB thing at the start partition number 1, and then boot, etc. are after, and some machines won't boot that
[19:01:03] <MrElendig> peetaur: also they for some reason never pulled in some fixes for the intel 215 cards

My transition from X to Wayland from one window manager to another was pretty seamless because an effort was made to make every part wm-agnostic so new applications are plug-and-play

When this commit is included it is stuck at `Starting kernel ...`. Reverting this commit on Master gets it booting again. Any idea where to report/ask?

[22:02:23] <sudomann> I assume for things like animated output, some rendering takes place on the server, no?
[22:02:51] <peetaur> ssh uses a pseudo terminal on the server end, and the real terminal is on the client side
[22:02:53] <ananke> sudomann: and like peetaur said, for VNC to work you'd need an X server on that 'cloud server'

[23:29:39] <Guest54214> lle and where should i look for documentation or for exploration? as in, i could be using i += i for my entire life without knowing about i++
[23:29:53] <lle> existing code on github
[23:30:19] <Guest54214> good idea
[23:30:34] <lle> for example: you're trying to do something in the language you're learning (sending an http request, for example)
[23:30:38] <lle> you can see how people do it
[23:31:02] <lle> for people learning python i'd always recommend: write a multi threaded HTTP server from scratch, no libs, only sockets and stuff that python comes with

[23:37:47] <wwalker> I want a reminder system.  I'd rather not write it from scratch, but I can.  I want to schedule reminders (think cron format), then at the given time, I should get a pop up window with a very small list of options - snooze - done - skip .  It should record what response it got.  If tyhe response is snooze, then it should pop up again based on the selected nsooze time.  Anyone know of a system like this
