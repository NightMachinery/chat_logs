[00:02:08] <akoana> RadSurfer: better than sed -i (it creates a temporary file, changes the inode number, permissions etc.) would be something like    printf '%s\n' '2000,3000d' w q | ed -s file  # that edits the file really in place

[03:15:15] <velix> Is there a good commandline based tool to set up simple VMs with qemu without needing to deal with XML or hundrets of commandline switches?
[03:15:45] <tag> io_uring is very interesting, in particular as an abstraction around nvme workloads
[03:15:51] <[[R]]> velix: do you want command line options or xml... make up your mind
[03:16:48] <kveroneau> velix, yes:  virt-install --connect qemu:///system --virt-type kvm --name $1 --location http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/installer-amd64/ --os-variant debian10 --disk size=4,pool=disks --memory 1024 --vcpu 2 --network network=default,model=virtio
[03:17:38] <velix> [[R]]: someting like "qemu setup --name debian debian". Done ;)
[03:17:39] <kveroneau> As an example.  Tailor it to your specific needs of course using the appropriate virt-install(1)
[03:17:42] <tesseract> do simple vms requre hundreds of commands though?
[03:17:50] <[[R]]> velix: and you want it to just guess what you want?
[03:18:02] <velix> kveroneau: Okay, I'm doing  this with qemu directly now prety similar.
[03:18:07] <velix> [[R]]: Yes! exactly :D
[03:18:09] * critr remembers getting stuck with no root password and no sudo after a debian install.
[03:18:24] <velix> [[R]]: Nah, use some defaults... like docker. It also knows what I want.
[03:18:24] <TJ-> critr: easy to fix!
[03:18:38] <[[R]]> velix: what does docker have to do with qemu?
[03:19:01] <critr> TJ-, i'm all ears
[03:19:04] <velix> [[R]]: Uh? I never said it was have something to do with each other. But you asked about guessing.
[03:19:24] <[[R]]> velix: huh?

[03:20:26] <kveroneau> velix, virt-install will generate the XML for libvirt, so you can then manage the VM via libvirt using virsh or virt-manager.

[03:21:28] <kveroneau> It really depends on your use-case for the VM, running through qemu directly via a start script is perfectly fine for many scenarios.
[03:21:33] <VMGuy23> a basic timeshift
[03:21:39] <VMGuy23> whoops wrong channell
[03:22:08] <kveroneau> However, you do get much more when using libvirt and QEMU together, and well worth the investment imo

[05:17:13] <floogy> Hi, what is the appropriate channel to discuss an issue with recovering a truncated CF-Card which is formatted with fat32. Every second byte seems to be increased by addition of four bit. In a canonical representation of 16 hexadezimal bytes separated by space in two columns and text between pipes every second column of bytes is increased by 4 bits. eg. 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
[05:17:13] <floogy> |................| is now 00 04 00 04 00 04 00 04  00 04 00 04 00 04 00 04 |................|. It happened due to a short I guess.

[09:53:27] <Hash> The only threat that 128 bit keys face is if an enormous quantum computer is developed that is capable of testing AES keys entirely within its quantum operations. Using Grover's algorithm a quantum computer could search for 128 bit key with only 2^64 operations. So to get an effective strength of 128 bits, one would need to use 256 bit keys.

[12:52:46] <kek_> hexnewbie, sourcing vs. execution was my issue. I'm not very well versed when it comes to bash so I wasn't aware of that. thanks
[12:52:48] <kek_> Another question. If I ssh onto my cluster, I'm on the login node. One then can submit a job (some program to run) using the bsub command. (some tool that handles ressources e.g. gives you 10 cores for 10 minutes). One can make the job interactive and run a shell as the job, which spawms a shell and you can work on the compute node directly (instead of passively submit a job). The issue: If you close the terminal, you
[12:52:48] <kek_> lose the ssh connection. if you reconnect, you are back at the login node and your "interactive shell" runs in the background. How can I get back "into" that shell? I do have tmux on the cluster. Interactive means https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=options-i

[13:10:21] <kek_> PaulFertser, I'm very new to tmux, so I might simply do something wrong. If I connect to the login node and submit an interactive shell job with tmux i.e. I run "bsub -Is tmux" I get tmux on the compute nodes but if I detach and get back to the login node, tmux ls doesn't show anything. It says "no server running ..." so I guess I can't use tmux to get back to my pseudo shell. I could of course, as you say, run tmux
[13:10:21] <kek_> locally but I'll lose connection for sure. I guess I could ssh on some other server I have and run tmux on there and use it as a "proxy" to keep the connection alive. I seems like such a basic issue, I probably must oversee some command to reattach the interactive shell or whatever.

[13:43:33] <evilop> the latest release is 5.2.0, you should try building gedit/gtksourceview from buildh, or try the flatpack builds
[13:43:47] <evilop> and if the problem is gone in the newer version, then rapport this to your distribution
[13:44:02] <cadmio> on debian 11 I've 4.8.0-1
[13:45:04] <evilop> should really rapport it to your distro even if it is not fixed upstream

[13:45:53] <evilop> if you don't want to compile yourself, then try the flatpak builds

[14:42:13] <djph> sunny93: '-L' sets up the forward.  So you'd do (for example) ssh -L 9022:somehost:22 ... then later on ssh -oPort=9022 user@localhost
[14:42:32] <jason1234> sunny93: this is an example of forward or ssh usage:   ssh -C -pXXXPORTNUMBER   username@IPMAINHOST   -L 2222:10.0.0.1:22   <-- this will ssh and forward port to the router openwrt for instance to your local.

[16:14:01] <hexnewbie> I wouldn't go out of my way to ascribe attributes by an optional extra to the main package, myself. But if you wish to play videos with DRM, you need non-free software, obviously.
[16:14:24] <jason1234> maybe it was better or would be better we keep using iceweasel and not go firefox (anyhow we will be dependent on firefox all the time by this business, nasty web world/planet).
[16:14:29] <farkaan> I looked more into the VSCode marketplace and apparently Microsoft has this bizarre thing where the repository is not open source yet the software on it is. (Whatever "open source" means to them is left to interpretation). So essentially, they don't want their servers to be used by open-source builds of vscode... probably because they cost money to
[16:14:30] <farkaan> maintain
[16:15:18] <hexnewbie> Besides, browsers do execute non-free JavaScript, ranging from cosmetic, intrusive, to full-blown web applications. That don't make them non-free either.

[19:27:02] <[twisti]> im running a complex reencryption process where it takes one directory, reencrypts the contents and saves it to another directory. i can see the progress from the growth of directory B, when it reaches the same size as A, the process will be finished. is there any tool i can use to visualize or display estimate time remaining something like that ? maybe via pv ? the process is already running

[19:28:34] <Psi-Jack> No.
[19:28:39] <ayecee> i'm not sure how pv helps here, if the process has already started
[19:29:37] <Psi-Jack> You could write a script, and do it, but that's not "simple" or a tool already made. 😛

[19:29:54] <[twisti]> no idea how pv works internally, but i figured i could just start a new process that runs df or something and have pv work off of that
[19:29:55] <ayecee> you could script it. get the size of the source dir, get the size of the target dir, and do math, and then run that in a loop. kind of ugly.
[19:29:56] <Psi-Jack> And definitely wouldn't be easy to account for time.

[22:49:54] <ayecee> mandanguita: how does a regular epub appear?
[22:50:07] <mandanguita> ayecee: EPUB document
[22:50:45] <rolltime> might be something about that epub file in particular. have you tried opening it with a reader?
[22:50:56] <hexnewbie> mandanguita: Can you extract it, and if you do, does it give any errors, are there .html files, mimetype, what does mimetype file say, is there extra metadata information XMLs?
[22:50:59] <ayecee> it could be this epub's mimetype is set incorrectly. one would have to examine file/libmagic's match for epubs, unpack this one, and correct the mismatch.
[22:51:09] <mandanguita> Calibre library is able to read it as an epub, but I've got problems with a splitter plugin because, since it is "not" an epub, it cannot operate on it
[22:51:24] <mandanguita> also, I can read it with the e-book reader of Calibre

[22:54:54] <ayecee> more likely problem with the epub
[22:54:55] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[22:55:13] <hexnewbie> That would break some tools. Maybe some zipped formats place the metadata elsewhere, and there was a false positive with some magic that made 'file' to think the file type is "K,("?

[22:55:40] <rolltime> could this be a separate issue from the 'file' one? Have you looked into the actual issue your reader is giving you? The filetype thing might be unrelated
[22:55:46] <CoderCop> Considering that this file behaves differently thant he other epubs mandanguita has and that it behaves differently both on his PC and his reader, I think it's much more likely that the file is outside of the epub spec in some way than a software bug.
[22:55:48] <mandanguita> akk: worked, that was genius
[22:55:49] <ayecee> the mime type, not the file type
[22:56:07] <jensen> Thanks guys, du + sort shows nothing out of the ordinary, pacman -Sc cleaned up 7GB. I have pacman hook for paccache so I will need to modify it accordingly
[22:56:42] <ayecee> if the mimetype file has the correct content with no extra characters, it might be enough to repack the epub file with zip.
[22:56:59] <hexnewbie> I've seen the kernel misinterpret magic on a block device that just coincidentally had the magic of something in the wrong place.
[22:57:17] <ayecee> like, maybe it was a malformed zip file, one that file didn't understand but zip did.

[23:40:18] <koala_man> if this wasn't a thing, I would have assumed that "we can't, the bootloader is built into the GPU and can't be updated" was hacker movie tech babble
[23:40:19] <djph> twainwek: I dunno, I'm just reading what you pasted.
[23:41:27] <hexnewbie> You should have seen my face when I was told my GPU (referred to as the ‘video card’ in the conversation in question) was inside my CPU.
[23:41:37] <TJ-> lovetruth: so as hexnewbie  said, after the pivot it cannot freshly open the files since they're masked. If it had them open and kept them that way before the pivot that wouldn't be a problem
[23:41:39] <lovetruth> twainwek, also - you just need a partition the "boot" partition as FAT16/FAT32
[23:42:07] <lovetruth> Where you'd have cmdline.txt and so on and so forth
[23:42:09] <hodapp> you can also rig a Ras Pi to boot UEFI if you really want to buuuut it still must go through that binary-blob-on-the-GPU nonsense
[23:42:21] <hexnewbie> I think authorized_keys (regardless of location) is opened anew every time you attempt a login, it is *not* kept open or kept in memory

[23:55:12] <powerman2206> I'm looking for a way to host a bunch of video files on a file server (was thinking Python's HTTP server but nginx is probably a better option since ->), I want it to be user/password protected and so that a video opens in the client's video player upon clicking a link to a video
[23:55:16] <ayecee> probably Psi-Jack

[23:56:53] <omero> does anyone knows if there is a working self-contained/statically built browser out there that can run on an old system?
[23:57:20] <omero> an old 32-bit system, that is
[23:57:24] <hexnewbie> omero: Creating a chroot with a new system that has only the browser installed might be an alternative.
[23:57:39] <powerman2206> ayecee: Hm, are there any docs for that? I saw that the nginx default config has `include mime.types;`, is that it?
[23:58:04] <ayecee> that's related, for sure.
