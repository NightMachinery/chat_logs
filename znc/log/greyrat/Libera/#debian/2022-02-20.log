[00:08:54] <nickgaw> yes true but then how would I go about adding to my swap vg group as the debian-installer created two volume groups one for the main system and a second for swap but I could not using the debian-installer add the swap drive that I wish to add during the installation process for some unknown reason so I am trying to add it manually so I have more swap space so what would I do to do this?
[00:08:59] <karlpinc> nickgaw: You could make your new partition a new physical volume and work from there.  But usually you make entire disks (or partitions that comprise "most of" an entire disk -- EFI execpted and so forth) physical volumes.

[00:39:42] <karlpinc> nickgaw: If you have specific requirements for where things go then you do want muliple volume groups.  Volume groups aggregate physical volumes.  So, typically, they are what controls what winds up on which physical disk.
[00:39:53] <nickgaw> true so can I encrypt it so it uses the same key as the other swap portion?
[00:40:54] <Khepra> technically, you can use the same passphrase and then decrypt_keyctl keyscript in crypttab so it reuses your one passphrase for both (all the crypttab entries)
[00:40:55] <karlpinc> nickgaw: It usually easiest to encrypt before making a physical volume.  So the whole pv is encrypted and there's fewer keys to manage.
[00:41:40] <karlpinc> (No matter how many logical volumes.)
[00:41:40] <Khepra> nickgaw: but first, is not 1GB of swap enough? you really do NOT want to use swap as "free memory". 1GB should suffice to swap out unused pages
[00:41:56] <nickgaw> Yes I do want it encrypted as if not that would remove the entire point of the encryption but at boot I would like to be able to enter in only one key one time to unlock the volume group is this possible as well as adding that extra space to the swap portion of the system?
[00:42:37] <Khepra> nickgaw: you can add any disk/partition/block device as anotehr PV to the entire vg
[00:43:18] <nickgaw> I would like to also have that 8 gigs around for large operations on the system as this extra portion of this laptop is a solid state drive that is so small I would like to use it as virtual memory is this not possible?
[00:43:54] <Khepra> you shouldn't abuse swap to offset lack of RAM
[00:44:15] <nickgaw> understandable but can I do this on this system?
[00:44:49] <Khepra> do what exactly, have 8GB swap in lieu of RAM?
[00:45:22] <nickgaw> How can I tell in debian the exact model name of the system as the name is warn off of this system but should it not be in the motherboard firmware somewhere then I can tell the maximum amount of memory that this system can use and I can just buy the new ram sticks?
[00:45:25] *** Joins: lunc (~lunc@user/lunc)
[00:45:41] <Khepra> one thing with multiple PVs is that afaik you don't have control where a particular data block will end up, in jbod setups like that (non-raid)
[00:45:49] <nickgaw> yes really have 9 gigs one on the physical spinning disk and the 8 on the small ssd?
[00:46:19] <sussudio> nickgaw: dmidecode | less
[00:46:33] <Khepra> nickgaw: you don't control which PV is used for which data block
[00:46:40] <nickgaw> So something could end up either on my main storage portion or the swap portion that would get deleted when the system was rebooted?
[00:47:09] <nickgaw> So what determins where swap is stored?
[00:47:10] <Khepra> what do you mean "something"? you can't use swap partition to write anything else on it
[00:47:28] <nickgaw> no I want to use it only for swap space.
[00:47:45] <Khepra> nickgaw: you're asking the wrong question.  you can't, under LVM, control which part of PV will be used for swap's LV
[00:48:48] <nickgaw> I want the main hard drive to be used for operating system storage which it is doing but the installer instead of using the solid state for the swap space took a gig out of the hard drive to use for swap space when I did not want it to do this and instead use the solid state portion as swap space are you saying this could not be done on this system?
[00:48:54] <Khepra> if you really need just to extend swap space, you can do it without LVM. just create a partition on sdb, encrypt it with a keyfile that's loaded off of the encrypted rootfs (or use decrypt_keyctl keyscript) and you can have multiple devices for swap, but that's illadvised, again, you don't have control which of them a page will end up on

[01:24:32] *** Quits: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:25:12] <amacater_> So - you might end up building for 16 hours on a standard VM in the cloud
[01:25:36] <amacater_> nickgaw: Where are you based?
[01:25:36] *** Joins: LtL (~debian@user/ltl)
[01:25:38] <nickgaw> yes they take a lot of time to build so would renting a virtual machine to do that when I want to test be an ok thing as I was looking at buying a system for just this purpose?  it is used but I am ok with that if it can handle building programs and code.
[01:25:58] <nickgaw> I am in the USA.
[01:26:28] <amacater_> How many $k do you have to spend?
[01:27:11] <nickgaw> Like I said I don't mind buying new hardware but want to get something that can handle lots of building not all at once but where I can check e-mail and not be stuck when the compilers are running all of the day and nothing else will run.
[01:28:10] <nickgaw> Lets say $2000 perhaps a little more or less it is basically just for compilation and building so for that do I need very powerful hardware?
[01:28:25] <amacater_> So: Firefox (and Chromium) change versions fast - such that Debian has issues keeping up with them. Android sources are relatively vast and complex - so that needs beefy hardware.
[01:28:26] <Khepra> the ryzen 5600x is the one I have. with 32GB RAMs, tht thing will build chromium in a few hours AND you get spare CPU for browsing, Youtube, music, ...
[01:29:15] *** Quits: Fausto (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:29:26] <nickgaw> Is that a desktop or laptop as for a compilation system a desktop would be better right?
[01:29:30] <Khepra> get a nice fast SSD, let's say a Crucial CT500MX  those are nice, fast and reliable
[01:29:31] <amacater_> You could try looking for business liquidators that have high powered workstations - so HP Z series workstations are beefy.
[01:29:43] <amacater_> Or a decent Lenovo tower.
[01:29:46] <Khepra> nickgaw: yes. no thermal throttling and the CPU packs bigger punch
[01:30:35] <amacater_> For my money - bigger CPU, space for much more memory, no thermal throttling. If you're visually impaired, you possibly don't need a gamer's graphics card which is what puts the cost up for most folk building one.
[01:31:18] *** Joins: dmacks (~dmacks@user/dmacks)
[01:31:29] <nickgaw> true I could care less about graphics but do want something that if I need sited help I could plug in a monitor can linux like debian run headless with just network only access?
[01:31:39] <amacater_> AVOID at all costs servers in 1U / 2U designed for data centres - you'll deafen yourself.
[01:31:51] <nickgaw> ok
[01:32:19] <nickgaw> I mean like a high end desktop system as a compilation system not a data center system.
[01:33:01] <amacater_> Pretty well, actually. Most VI folk I know use command line anyway - which is what makes me wonder about you wanting to build firefox for yourself?
[01:33:26] <Khepra> nickgaw: my current workstation cost about 1k €, plus 1k for the fancy gpu. you can get decent building/compiling machnes for that money, new. I can imagine used would be much cheaper
[01:33:28] <amacater_> Data centre systems are lovely - but have tiny 1 or 2 inch fans at high revs.
[01:34:03] <nickgaw> The gui is accessible with orca and other tools with the keyboard as I don't use a mouse.
[01:35:48] <amacater_> Refurbished HP Z620 6 core Xeon from walmart - $435 US - find a dealer locally who supplies businesses and ask.
[01:36:04] <nickgaw> Your system that you build chromium on is it a desktop or a laptop?
[01:36:14] <amacater_> That one only had 16G of memory but will take much more.
[01:36:32] <amacater_> I'd _NEVER_ ever build chromium or firefox on a laptop.
[01:36:40] <amacater_> Too big.
[01:37:06] <amacater_> The question is really: why do you want to when Debian provides a version that works?
[01:37:42] <nickgaw> On my windows system it takes a few hours and the fans speed up all of the way but it is all solid state and I can still browse the web and do other things can windows cross compile to debian binaries or would installing a virtual machine on there be the best option?
[01:37:45] <Khepra> the bugged out vulnerable for months version?
[01:37:57] <amacater_> Latest versions are causing issues for the maintainers because of unstable Rust toolchains - that's why
[01:38:26] <nickgaw> I like to test out nightly builds.
[01:38:42] *** Joins: ElPresidente (~ElPreside@2600:1700:3d10:4870:aaa1:59ff:fe3c:ddb4)
[01:38:47] <amacater_> Windows can't compile  to Debian binaries. We're biased here - I'd always recommend a Linux machine - perhaps with a Windows VM.
[01:39:29] <nickgaw> ok as windows has better gui accessibility then debian gui does so you are saying run debian as the host and windows as the guest?
[01:39:45] <Khepra> nickgaw: on debian you can use snaps with firefox edge/nightly channel. methinks for chrome too. dunno, but I think flatpaks exist like tht as well. wold that work?
[01:39:54] <Khepra> nickgaw: or do you really want or need to compile?
[01:40:02] <nickgaw> and not the windows as the host and debian as the guest way?
[01:40:10] <amacater_> This is a debian support channel - we'd always suggest Debian first.
[01:40:17] <dmacks> Is there a GUI editor for .deb archives? For example, I would like a file-manager type of window for the filesystem contents and text-editor for the control and other packaging scripts.
[01:40:26] <Khepra> dmacks: zip?
[01:40:53] <dmacks> I know how to manually unpack it, edit/copy/move files, repack it. I'm looking to automate that cycle.
[01:41:00] <nickgaw> probably so are these nightly builds like in tar.xz or debian packages I use bullseye on this Samsung system.
[01:41:27] <Khepra> nickgaw: they're snaps or flatpaks. diretly installed containerized executables that just work
[01:41:52] <amacater_> nickgaw: I think you may need to go away and think about exactly what you want to do. I know one fully blind Debian dev. and two more at least with visual impairment. I'd suggest you contact them to ask about Debian accessibility. Wait a minute ...
[01:41:59] <nickgaw> So these are for linux then?  I know nightlies exist for windows but was not sure about linux.
[01:42:18] <Khepra> nickgaw: let me check
[01:43:20] <amacater_> https://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility/ is the mailing list. Samuel Thibault is the  person I'd rely on for good advice here.

[01:44:18] <Khepra> nickgaw: snaps have "edge" firefox channel, methinks that is nightly?
[01:44:31] <Khepra> nickgaw: also chromium
[01:44:33] <nickgaw> I will look into that.
[01:44:37] <Khepra> I don't know about flatpaks.

[01:45:33] <amacater_> I spend a bunch of time on debian-user mailing list helping folk but I'm not visually impaired, though much of my dayjob is disability issues at the moment.
[01:45:37] <nickgaw> Just wondering if I was looking for a new linux debian based laptop for general work do systems exist that don't require the installer image that contains the non-free firmware as I always have to use that image when doing a fresh installation?
[01:46:16] <amacater_> nickgaw: In general terms - no - modern laptops are starting to require non-free firmware even to get some sound hardware to work.
[01:46:22] <Khepra> how does orka handle typos?
[01:46:33] <nickgaw> Do purely free open systems exist at all?
[01:46:44] <amacater_> It's a current issue - and there's likely to be a Debian general resolution round firmware sometime soon.
[01:46:51] <Khepra> nickgaw: doubtful. even purism had to make exceptions
[01:47:07] <nickgaw> I am using the espeakup screen reader on the console and it uses espeak which is ok but not the best human sounding voice.
[01:47:08] <amacater_> nickgaw: Barely, honestly. Pretty much everything has non-free wifi drivers.
[01:47:19] <Khepra> amacater_: ah so debian finally joins the 21st century communities of distros, circa 2034? :)
[01:47:23] <amacater_> Intel hardware now has non-free sound
[01:47:51] <nickgaw> That is what I meant wifi drivers so most people use the non-free image to do the installation then and will debian still support such a system?
[01:47:52] *** Joins: ElPresidente (~ElPreside@2600:1700:3d10:4870:aaa1:59ff:fe3c:ddb4)
[01:48:09] <nickgaw> What is non-free sound?
[01:48:29] <amacater_> Debian will still support stuff installed with the unofficial non-free firmware media.
[01:49:02] <amacater_> It's unofficial because it includes non-free software which we can't fix if it goes wrong - we're reliant on packaging blobs.
[01:49:26] <amacater_> The official installer contains no non-free software at all - as per current policy.
[01:49:27] <nickgaw> yes but what is non-free sound?
[01:49:57] <amacater_> non-free sound - Some newer Intel chipsets actually require a binary blob / firmware to enable sound output at all :(
[01:50:16] <nickgaw> Is this a bad thing?
[01:50:34] <amacater_> It means you can install your laptop and espeak doesn't speak ...
[01:50:49] <nickgaw> Without the special firmware?
[01:50:55] <amacater_> Yes
[01:51:16] <nickgaw> There was a talk about adding support to the debian-installer for this very feature.
[01:51:33] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Quit: ars longa vita brevis)
[01:51:44] <amacater_> Absolutely - I think samuel thibault actually made a special media image to check ...
[01:52:23] <amacater_> Khepra: Sarcasm doesn't become you: just because Debian cares about what it packages :D
[01:52:45] <jelly> systems with free/open source firmware do exist, but are niche, often not x86, and either very expensive or very non-performant, or both
[01:52:55] <Khepra> amacater_: but if that makes it unusable, it should rethink what it really cares about
[01:53:03] * amacater_ is part of the media team that tests images and is also part of the Debian community team.
[01:54:00] <amacater_> Khepra: It is rethinking - see above - there may be a firmware GR to resolve the issue. It's no good having a free distro if it can't be installed. Fedora / Ubuntu etc. don't actually care quite as much as Debian does about freeness of firmware
[01:54:08] <Khepra> (besides, I'm made of sarcasm and cynical nihilism. you should know that by now ;) )
[01:54:22] <amacater_> :D
[01:54:55] <nickgaw> Does debian own arm hardware or do arm based virtual private servers exist for testing things on arm or other based hardware?
[01:55:36] <amacater_> nickgaw: Yes, we have _lots_ of ARM hardware - mostly small boards - almost nobody has performant ARM servers - and that's another rant for another time.

I know I can twist this around and use only AllowGroups, because even my unpriv user is in the same named group. But still. can't seem to find a related directive in the manpage that would allow a.... union, not intersection, of the two sets.

[18:48:43] <Caretaker13> I was using at though. Is at now a subset of cron?
[18:49:05] <Khepra> no
[18:51:00] <Caretaker13> Okay, so I can't echo using the at command (to set a one-time reminder, for eample). That's disappointing.

[18:52:59] <Caretaker13> Okay, I'll check them out. Thanks!
[18:53:17] <Khepra> if you install libnotify-bin,  you can exec   notify-send "Hello!" and your DE will show a popup.
[18:53:40] <Khepra> Now there's some limitations and workarounds to that, something somethign dbus, I haven't investigated fully, but your DE or WM needs to support it
[18:53:51] <Sensiva> and in case you are doing it remotely (via SSH) 'DISPLAY=:0 notify-send "Hello"'
[18:54:02] <Khepra> yea

[23:21:20] <karlpinc> !v
[23:21:21] <dpkg> i heard v is at http://objectcentral.com/ (Portable C++ GUI Framework) or velocity, or the roman numeral for five, or a highly caffeinated "energy drink" thats availible in Australia and in some parts of the UK.  XFire runs on this stuff. very for lazy people
[23:21:22] <karlpinc> !vt
[23:21:40] <karlpinc> !vt
[23:21:40] <dpkg> well, vt is Virtual Terminal, like the console; change VTs using Alt+Left/Right or Alt+F1, Alt+F2 etc.  To get from X to a VT, use Ctrl+Alt+F1 (and Alt+F7 to get back, most likely).  You can also use "chvt" to switch VT.  VT is also used to mean Intel VT-x or VT-d (virtualization support; the AMD counterpart is called AMD-V or Pacifica), ask me about <xve>.

[23:36:39] *** Quits: mavhq (~quassel@mapp-14-b2-v4wan-161519-cust401.vm15.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: http://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[23:36:58] <sney> from recovery mode, look at the output of 'journalctl -b-1' to see if there are any related warnings
[23:36:59] <frost-core> sney : i dont have video drivers for intel gma 3600, as they dont exist for linux kernels 3.6 and up
[23:37:13] *** Joins: mavhq (~quassel@mapp-14-b2-v4wan-161519-cust401.vm15.cable.virginm.net)
[23:37:52] <frost-core> it shows data from specified boot -1 not available
[23:37:54] <sney> right, the i915 *driver* is part of the kernel, but it still sometimes requires *firmware*
[23:38:38] *** Joins: martums59 (~martums@user/martums)
[23:39:17] <sney> that log should exist, strange, well see if firmware-misc-nonfree is installed
[23:40:31] *** Joins: A|an (~Alan@173.218.175.171)
[23:40:39] <sney> alternately, do you have another computer on your network that can ssh into your debian system? if so, let debian boot to your black screen, then ssh in and look at journalctl that way
[23:40:40] <frost-core> reffered by other package
[23:40:44] *** Quits: easyriders (~easyrider@xb9b5df82.cust.hiper.dk) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:40:48] <sney> it's in non-free,
[23:40:49] <sney> !non-free
[23:40:49] <dpkg> [non-free] a component which contains software that does not comply with the <DFSG>.  To add non-free packages to your packages index, ask me about <non-free sources>.  To see which non-free packages are installed ask me about <non-free list>.
[23:40:56] * sney sighs
[23:41:01] <sney> !non-free sources
[23:41:02] <dpkg> Edit /etc/apt/sources.list, ensure that the two main Debian mirror lines end with "main contrib non-free" rather than just "main", then «apt-get update».  But bear in mind that you'll be installing <non-free> software.  These may have onerous terms; check the licenses.  See also <sources.list>.

[23:42:10] <frost-core> its not installed, so im installing it
[23:42:44] <frost-core> and, as i said, no native intel gma 3600 drivers, because after kernel 3.5 support was removed

[23:44:26] <frost-core> and i remember this happening on every debian install i did
[23:44:33] <sney> ohhh that's the powervr one isn't it
[23:44:39] <sney> I completely forgot about those haha
[23:45:09] <frost-core> it is

[23:45:46] <sney> ok, the firmware package is unlikely to accomplish anything in that case, and we really do need to see the log

[23:46:34] <sney> Xorg log would be good too, assuming it isn't trying to launch gnome with wayland
[23:46:45] <frost-core> im using lxde here my lad
[23:47:06] <sney> first time you said that, my dude. if you want people to know details you need to provide them

[23:49:46] <sney> Xorg wouldn't be trying to run in recovery mode. just look at the top few lines and make sure you pastebin the one that doesnt have 'nomodeset' in the kernel command line.

[23:51:10] <sney> your display manager (lightdm?) would not automatically run Xorg in recovery mode, is what I meant. it's good to know you're able to get in directly though.

[23:53:31] <sney> can you pastebin an Xorg log that's not from a boot with nomodeset?
[23:54:15] <frost-core> sney : how do i know that?
[23:54:39] <sney> the kernel command line is close to the top of the X log, see the end of line 6 in your paste
