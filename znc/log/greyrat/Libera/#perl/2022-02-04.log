[00:50:50] <enyc> not convinced fills exactly same niche though
[00:51:04] <simcop2387> ozzzo_work: yep.  if you're doing it with an io async loop though you can also get it to "sleep" just your area of execution currently.

[02:23:22] <daemon> so ... something fun
[02:23:26] <daemon> I appear to own a domain
[02:23:29] <daemon> perl.place
[02:23:37] <daemon> does anyone have any idea why I registered this a week or so ago
[02:23:45] <simcop2387> daemon: i used to have perl.sexy for the same reason
[02:24:04] <simcop2387> also i kinda like ovpn-admin for my uses.
[02:24:12] <daemon> I have been trying to chop down my domains you know remove ones I am not doing anythign with
[02:24:24] <daemon> but last week I appeared to have amde the active decision to purchase perl.place
[02:24:34] <simcop2387> yea i did that a few years ago and then ended up buying https://www.omeowgle.com again
[02:24:34] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ See what's happening - Omeowgle <https://www.omeowgle.com/public> ]
[02:24:41] <enyc> simcop2387: I remmeber when ruby / rails / ruby-on-rails  was being heard fo so much
[02:24:54] <daemon> I think its somethign to do with a wiki
[02:25:00] <simcop2387> enyc: the scaling and performance issues hit them hard
[02:25:07] <daemon> i think the idea was something like a wiki for irc, that was perl related
[02:25:15] <daemon> or at least that is what my brain is 'suggesting' it was for
[02:25:17] <simcop2387> daemon: probably.  maybe for some of the advice we usualy give here but a bit more fleshed out?
[02:25:24] <simcop2387> i sort of remember a discussion like that
[02:25:30] <daemon> yeah you was in it I think
[02:25:33] <daemon> as well as a few others
[02:25:42] <simcop2387> and you were there! and you were there! and you i don't know
[02:25:42] <daemon> but I cannot quite put my finger on precisely what the deal was
[02:26:11] <daemon> I mean a wiki for irc.perl.org #perl and here would not be a bad idea
[02:26:16] <daemon> especailly as the domain is already owned
[02:26:44] <simcop2387> i think you can turn a github wiki into a github pages easily too and then put it on the domain.  then there's no need to even pay to host it
[02:28:01] <daemon> eh i have so many servers and vm's ist really costless for me to do
[02:28:13] <daemon> but what would we want to do with it
[02:28:20] <daemon> would we want to tie it in with your perlbot for instance
[02:28:26] <daemon> or would we want it tied to pause id's
[02:28:34] <daemon> what could we do with such a thing
[02:28:40] <daemon> lets not forget we have no perl wiki's
[02:28:53] <daemon> we have java and php ones
[02:28:58] <daemon> but as far as I know, no perl based ones

[04:04:19] <LeoNerd> How do you imagine that to be unsafe?

[04:04:56] <LeoNerd> my $cols = chars(); $SIG{WINCH} = sub { $cols = chars() };   and then just be reading from $cols whenever
[04:05:06] <LeoNerd> That way you don't screw up

[06:17:02] <FlorianBad> aquanight: it's actually fairly simple once you know that   \eM = go to beginning of previous line     \e[K =  clear that line      \n = go to next line (since we didn't clear)

[06:30:04] <FlorianBad> in fact with that and a correspondance table from there:   https://www.ditig.com/256-colors-cheat-sheet    It would be easy to convert a picture into "terminal pixels":)  And of course a video frame by frame at something like 1fps

[16:27:46] <Botje> and maybe more importantly: what are you going to do with this.

[16:31:24] <Botje> BaltecoTroll: note that that completely ignores special characters for the shell, which means that you cannot use the resulting string for anything other than logging.

[16:33:23] <Botje> and of course you have no idea how your arguments were quoted in the calling shell.
[16:33:33] <Botje> foo\ bar and "foo bar" produce the same value in @ARGV
[16:34:07] <BaltecoTroll> yep. coz it will be prerpocessed before

[17:17:59] <Altreus> I have been so advised and I am doing that
[17:18:31] <huf> eh, same thing really
[17:18:43] <huf> return just has a slightly different catch mechanism
[17:18:47] <Altreus> that's right
[17:18:57] <Altreus> People should use the appropriate scope of return
[17:19:11] <huf> how about not using return at all, only exceptions? why do we need both?
[17:19:12] <huf> :)

[17:19:24] <LeoNerd> Heh.. So, the difference really is what if you don't write anything special
[17:19:41] <LeoNerd> If you don't write the special "I should check the error value" code, it gets dropped on the floor and totally ignored
[17:19:52] <huf> we dont need last and next either
[17:19:57] <LeoNerd> If you don't write the special try/catch syntax, the error propagates upwards to someone else who will handle it
[17:20:02] <LeoNerd> It asks to speak to the manager
[17:20:06] <LeoNerd> Exceptions are Karen
[17:22:31] * ilmari is sad that his wife's name (who is _not_ A Karen™) has become a slur :(
[17:22:55] <ilmari> I bet ether isn't best pleased either …
[17:23:36] <ilmari> the problem with exceptions is that it makes potential failures invisible
[17:23:49] <ilmari> Rust's Result<T,E> type and ? operator make this explicit, but ergonomic
[17:24:58] <tm604> java solved that with checked exceptions, to the delight of developers everywhere
[17:25:33] <Altreus> LeoNerd: I was just thinking the same. A nonlocal return simply means that whatever you were doing is not going to work, and it's up to you to decide at what point to do something else
[17:25:59] <Altreus> Throwing an exception means you're forced to make the code work, whereas returning error codes means you're forced to make the code fail
[17:28:55] <ilmari> the problem with not checking error codes is fixed by having a sum type which wraps the return value in an Ok variant or the error in an Err variant
[17:29:27] <ilmari> so the compiler makes you explicitly check which one you have before you can get at the value
[17:32:07] *** Joins: martinus__ (~martin@111.27.202.77.rev.sfr.net)
[17:33:48] <ilmari> but the ? operator means you don't have to write out the whole check and unpack/return each time: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator

[17:38:44] <Altreus> I do like the principle of formalising error types that can be returned

[17:42:56] <ilmari> I think the Result<T,E> type and ? operator is the best combination of both worlds that I've seen
[17:58:50] <ilmari> of course you can't get the compile time effect in perl, but I wonder how a wrapper type with is_* and unwrap_* methods similar to Result would be to use
[17:59:11] <ilmari> plus fatal overloads for everything, so you don't accidentally use it :)
