[02:53:57] <CalimeroTeknik> after the reinvention of the flat tire, the reinvention of the flat earth?
[03:02:39] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: it’s probably just a distraction
[03:03:12] <Joanna> Although I have to admit from a certain perspective the earth does look flat.
[03:09:13] <Joanna> What do you all think of russia shutting off gas tomorrow for hostile countries who doesn’t pay in rubles ? That should be interesting
[03:12:47] <Joanna> Who don’t pay in rubles... I wonder how anyone gets rubles besides selling something to russia
[03:29:26] <CalimeroTeknik> well it's true, all spheroids, patatoids and other celestial and potato bodies look rather flat locally

[04:08:34] <CalimeroTeknik> money's being pumped into it
[04:08:38] <CalimeroTeknik> so it floats
[04:12:37] <Joanna> Whose money?
[04:25:49] <CalimeroTeknik> well, I'm thinking of the generous donators of the Flat Earth Society and such, with various fun and less fun motives
[04:31:50] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: who owns the flat earth society?
[04:32:19] <Joanna> What are their motives?
[04:36:09] <Joanna> There seem to be a lot of people promoting unnatural unrealistic things
[04:38:16] <Joanna> On the other hand there are very closed minded people who won’t consider anything outside of what they were already taught. Unless presented by an authority figure of course.
[06:00:07] <Decker> sure some of both.

[07:49:09] <Decker> (hmm maybe it was 2nd shot; first booster?)
[07:52:08] <Decker> why would anywhere be any different?  Who are the controlling agents?  Is it like the prison guards? Somehow someone gave them a badge they must excersize?

[09:13:15] <Joanna> Decker: in general my opinion is it’s best to avoid drugs of all kinds :) I know of two people who have disappeared from irc after getting their shots after being regulars for years.  The people controlling social media are just people who are told what opinions/themes to encourage/discourage they can work for government or private companies that can be hired to sway public opinion. They usually have multiple accounts and pretend to 
[09:13:15] <Joanna> be many different people. There are also various forms of chat bots that can be disruptive.
[09:13:55] <Decker> saw a study go by that cannibis might be a preventative 
[09:15:27] <Joanna> It’s kind of strange that they suddenly decided to make marajuana legal isn’t it. You know the original reason they made it illegal was that hemp was competing with timber industry
[09:16:11] <Joanna> Hemp is much better for making paper and cloth than wood or cotton in terms of resource usage
[09:17:55] <Joanna> Believing in cannabis is still believing in drugs but I don’t care if others use it it’s certainly less dangerous than many drugs
[09:19:26] <Joanna> Decker:
[09:21:15] <Decker> yaya :) follow the $$$ :) 
[09:23:06] <Joanna> They originally made marijuana illegal to stigmatize Mexicans and send them back to Mexico
[09:23:16] <Joanna> Also
[09:24:30] <Joanna> I’ve seen propaganda movies about marijuana making people into crazy criminals and hippies
[09:27:07] <Joanna> They like to encourage people to use illegal drugs then bust them and send them off to prison. The literally have taught kids about drugs in school. And media is full of drug propaganda.
[09:28:35] <Joanna> They always steer people with mixed signals

[11:56:22] <Joanna> Closed mouth smile :)
[11:56:33] <Joanna> Hi HaMsTeRs
[11:58:06] <HaMsTeRs> Hi Joanna and GeDaMo
[11:58:20] <Joanna> What’s new?
[11:59:47] <HaMsTeRs> nth much, just bought a 2 years old Mac Mini i7 64GB RAM + 1 TB storage still with one year warenty for $930 usd.  Basically it's use for my VMware lab.  any comment on if it's a good deal?  (talking about mac mini 2018 though, not hardware comparisons between other brands :D)
[12:00:09] <Joanna> Speaking of security I heard that Putin is banning all foreign software for infrastructure related things
[12:00:40] <Joanna> I have a Mac mini I haven’t used in long time it’s amazingly compact
[12:00:54] <Joanna> Mines a lot older
[12:02:22] <Joanna> I guess my Mac mini is probably a lot different than yours , mine is pre 2014
[12:02:58] <HaMsTeRs> 2014 is good also.  Just throw in some RAM and could build a virtualization lab :D
[12:03:19] <GeDaMo> I'm just looking at RAM for my old machine
[12:03:44] <HaMsTeRs> I have no comment on Putin these days.   At first, I thought he's cool.  But now, I rather never know he exist
[12:04:00] <HaMsTeRs> RAMs are much cheaper now days
[12:04:34] <Joanna> It’s hard to really know what’s happening in Russia I wish I knew a russian to interrogate:)
[12:05:09] <GeDaMo> Is this cheap? 16GB for £90 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B009M0TF3W/ref=twister_B00QKM8SS8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
[12:05:33] <Joanna> I’ve heard various things about Mac making bad design decisions on later models of things . I was very annoyed when I saw they got rid of mag safe on laptops
[12:06:02] <Joanna> No idea what current prices are good or not.
[12:08:19] <GeDaMo> IT could be more expensive just because of how old my machine is :P
[12:09:25] <Joanna> I’m guilty of trying to use old machines
[12:13:14] <GeDaMo> OK, I found another one for £52 
[12:13:47] <Joanna> I have an old  Mac laptop from 2010 which is very slow
[12:14:43] <GeDaMo> I bought this PC in 2009, it's fast enough fopr me most of the time
[12:16:13] <Joanna> My biggest issue is I don’t like it when fans on computers start running in the summertime
[12:27:33] <Joanna> Did you  ever need a new hard drive for 2009 laptop?
[12:28:45] <GeDaMo> Do laptops not use SATA?
[12:56:53] <HaMsTeRs> have a nice day everyone
