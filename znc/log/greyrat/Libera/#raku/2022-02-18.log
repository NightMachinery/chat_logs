[02:30:12] <qorg11> Is it possible to output moarvm bytecode so rakudo don't have to compile everytime?
[02:30:20] <qorg11> So a CGI application doesn't take a lot to load
[02:31:03] <[Coke]> modules are precompiled.
[02:31:20] <[Coke]> so if you put your stuff in a Helper module and 'use Helper' all that will only be compiled once.
[02:31:32] <[Coke]> (also don't do CGI. :)
[02:31:49] <qorg11> What's wrong with CGI?
[02:32:06] <[Coke]> eh. it's an older tech stack, but it checks out.
[02:32:15] <qorg11> It ain't broke you know
[02:32:29] <[Coke]> so, no worries if it's solving your problem - but there are newer things to use if you like.
[02:35:49] <qorg11> Well, what i really want is to speed up rakudo's init
[02:39:53] <qorg11> And i guess what takes some time is the compilation to MoarVM bytecode
[02:40:00] <qorg11> So i want to output MoarVM bytecode
[02:40:11] <lizmat> qorg11: what you want, is to have a look at cro.services
[02:40:48] <lizmat> putting your code in a module and 'use'ing that *is* the equivalent of loading bytecode
[02:41:17] <lizmat> it works best if you set it up as a module  and actually install the module

[02:53:21] <japhb> qorg11: The problem with basic CGI is that you have to (fork, exec, init, run, clean up) for every request.  Other stacks allow you to remove most of those (on a per-request basis, at least).
[02:56:01] <japhb> qorg11: Also note that since MAIN can be exported (like any other sub), you can have the entirety of your program in the module that you load, and literally the entire main program can be "use ActualImplementation;" and everything else including MAIN can be in the ActualImplementation module (if you're using #! lines, just add one at the top of the script, making it two lines).
[02:56:32] <japhb> I do this for basically any app I write where I care about startup time.
[02:58:53] <moon-child> exec is not too bad, if you are perl or c
[02:58:55] <moon-child> only if you are raku
[02:58:57] <moon-child> :)
[03:00:35] <moon-child> but yeah, startup time even without loading any non-core code is like 200ms I think, definitely prefer not cgi

[17:53:22] <japhb> lizmat++  # Ecosystem movement
[18:10:13] <kawaii_> Any ideas why this type check fails and complains about being fed a UUID when well... That's exactly what it's supposed to be? `Type check failed in assignment to $!uuid; expected UUID but got UUID (UUID.new(bytes => Bu...)` / `my $user = User.^load(uuid => %request<auth>);`, in this case `%request<auth>` is technically a string I guess but it should validate as a UUID... I also tried `my $user = User.^load(uuid => UUID.new(%request<auth>));` 
[18:10:13] <kawaii_> but for some reason UUID complains about being passed multiple arguments when I clearly have only passed it one.
[18:16:57] <lizmat> does running with --ll-exception provide any pointers?
[18:19:37] <kawaii_> hmm the error output looks no different with that flag added 
[18:19:53] <kawaii_> I'll make a paste with more complete code in a moment
[18:19:58] <lizmat> you should have more  :-)    
[18:19:59] <lizmat> ok
[18:21:17] <kawaii_> I stripped out anything irrelevant https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/eXJq1i1B/
[18:22:58] <kawaii_> %request<auth> contains a string which in this case is a UUID-like object, and my database does indeed contain a single entry in the User model with a valid UUID in the uuid column 
[18:24:35] <lizmat> kawaii_: perhaps better asked on #cro  :-)
[18:25:26] <kawaii_> I had a slight suspicion Cro might be responsible for my issue, I'll go bother them soon if I don't make any progress myself :) 
[18:26:08] <lizmat> kawaii_: also, make sure you have the latest versions of IO::Socket::Async::SSL and HTTP:HPACK
[18:26:17] <lizmat> if you're using 2022.02
[18:26:32] <japhb> kawaii_: Actually, on #red might be good too.  Does Red know how to inflate/deflate a UUID from the DB?
[18:27:25] <guifa> Is it possible there are two separate UUID classes?  (maybe one from Red and one from Cro?)
[18:27:43] <kawaii_> ugh, that's a good point
[18:29:48] <guifa> i haven't yet jumped into either yet, but UUID is one of those things that's so simple I can see many people making one to avoid dependency hell.  Maybe if you use UUID(Str()) ?
[18:30:17] <guifa> Clunky but I'd assume any UUID package could coerce to-from strings
