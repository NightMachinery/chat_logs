[00:02:27] <kline> im unconvinced that "how to vtube" is actually on-topic
[00:03:14] <kline> the core part that is "on topic" is that it involves some code and configuration for setting up hardware and software
[00:03:35] <kline> would a post with the same stuff but focussed on the hardware and software involved in a flight simulation game be relevant?

[00:53:54] <imode> I used to think that particular story was off-topic but I've kind of rethought it.
[00:54:10] <kline> imode, community-meta battlestation posts are on-topic inasmuch as we need a community culture

[00:56:07] <kline> ive read that and also the previous "how i vtuber" and i dont think either of them are on topic, no
[00:57:03] <imode> I've seen articles that describe "how to do X" on the site and they weren't faced with similar thoughts.
[00:57:25] <kline> you're welcome to link them to me and ill explain where i personally draw my lines
[00:57:47] <kline> "how to do x" as related to software engineering i think is fine, but not "how i do x" for office productivity
[00:57:59] <imode> "how to set up X"?
[00:58:03] <kline> and explaining how you happen to set up your video calls with a 3d avatar is at best office productivity
[00:58:26] <d42> no fun allowed :3
[00:58:34] <kline> like specifically, how does anything in either of those articles improve your software engineering
[00:58:58] <imode> how does "There is no such thing as a static website" improving my software engineering.
[00:59:12] <imode> how is "How bad is QWERTY, really?" improving my software engineering.
[00:59:23] <imode> how is "GitHub will support mermaid diagrams" improving my software engineering.
[00:59:40] <imode> how is the Nim Community Survey Results improving my software engineering.
[00:59:44] <kline> >how bad is qwerty really
[00:59:49] <kline> im sceptical about this but i havent read
[00:59:56] <imode> or "Reeding List 2022-01-03"
[00:59:59] <kline> >github will support mermaid diagrams
[01:00:11] <kline> uninteresting news to me personally, but its at least about better software documentation
[01:00:18] <kline> im reading about the static websites now
[01:00:23] <imode> but none of these meet that guideline you just stated.
[01:00:31] <imode> and are therefore off-topic, and therefore don't belong here.
[01:00:33] <imode> which I would agree.
[01:00:55] <kline> so the bit i tend to crutch on is: "Will this improve the reader's next program? Will it deepen their understanding of their last program? Will it be more interesting in five or ten years? "
[01:01:21] <imode> the vtuber post could qualify under point 3, but none of those articles I mentioned meet any of those requirements.

[01:01:44] <kline> im reading the static website article now and im not terribly impressed but im not inherently thinking that discussing website design principles is off topic
[01:02:01] <kline> i think its a weak article, but one that is on-topic
[01:02:31] <imode> let's be honest, none of the articles on the front page are going to improve the reader's next program, or deepen any kind of understanding.
[01:02:47] <kline> dont you think thats a problem?
[01:03:07] <imode> it is, but that's because the kinds of things that do that are so few and far between these days that it's difficult to keep an entire site going on the basis of them.
[01:03:21] <kline> honestly, i do think right now, skimming the front page, that this is a very weak front page
[01:03:25] <imode> unless I start posting academic articles on different abstract programming approaches like spatial computing or models of concurrency.

[01:04:04] <kline> yeah, shit
[01:04:37] <kline> but im not sure id really accept "the front page is currently shit, feel free to post more weak-to-offtopic articles"
[01:04:40] <imode> the paradox of having a content aggregator with that high of a bar is that you're going to go stagnant for weeks.
[01:04:50] <imode> until someone posts something quality to comment on.
[01:05:02] <kline> fine by me
[01:05:03] <imode> so you have a choice, be more lenient or be more strict.
[01:05:15] <kline> id, personally, lean towards being more strict
[01:05:23] *** Quits: jlindgren (~jlindgren@user/jlindgren) (Client Quit)
[01:05:23] <imode> so would I. but I also like having new content. :P
[01:05:36] <imode> so I maintain a balance.
[01:05:47] <kline> the point for me in a content aggregator is people all contributing good stuff, so that i dont have to spend time combing through dreck
[01:05:48] *** Joins: jlindgren (~jlindgren@user/jlindgren)
[01:06:04] <imode> I agree.
[01:06:08] <kline> that obviously goes out the window if you focus on throughput rather than quality: theres more to have to go through, and theres less you want to read
[01:06:21] <kline> so im just fine with there only being 2-3 good posts a day
[01:06:37] <kline> i suspect there would still be plenty of posts in practice to read if we were more strict in any case
[01:06:42] <imode> if someone was teaching me how to knit a wool shirt, for example, I'd think that interesting, but not on topic for a tech aggregator.
[01:07:17] <imode> fwiw I flagged the vtuber stuff as off-topic but I went back and re-thought it.
[01:07:26] <kline> right - and while i think "teaching how to code is broken" is interesting (tech education is a really important topic to me), i dont think its on topic
[01:07:30] <kline> its good, but not for here
[01:07:33] <kline> and thats ok
[01:07:41] <imode> should we have an off-topic section of lobste.rs :P
[01:11:01] <kline> there used to be .an

[12:56:09] <nightbreak> It seems like a really cool project but I'm not sure how useful it is if one really wants to daily drive the product
[12:56:22] <daegalus> Over a decade ago, but not much has changed, so ya
[12:57:11] <daegalus> It's not daily driveable really unless you want to constantly build everything from source, manually, or write new scripts
[12:58:31] <daegalus> It's a great thing to do to really learn how Linux works and fits together. As a DevOps and backend engineer, the stuff I learned from LFS has been really valuable as foundational knowledge

[12:59:36] <daegalus> It's also good if you plan to someday attempt to make a completely unique Linux distro. You wouldn't use LFS but still learn a lot of core concepts

[13:01:47] <nightbreak> Ahhh I see thanks for the tips. I'm starting my very first software engineer job in the fall and I want to pick up on some practical knowledge that's not really taught in school and LFS seems very relevant.

[13:03:13] <daegalus> It is, but purely educational. It will boot and work, but just a bit of a pita to maintain afterwards
[13:05:23] <nightbreak> Makes sense. I guess not having a package manager or modern niceties like systemd make daily driving it quite the unusual experience
[13:08:47] <daegalus> I still definitely think it's worth the time. Plus with modern computing, it goes faster, and easier to get support.
[13:08:51] <daegalus>  I did it on a 1ghz/256mb ram machine. My only internet connected machine. So I had to print the entire book. And I couldn't easily join IRC for help.
[13:10:23] <daegalus> Also the time unit in the book is a BU, the time it takes to compile binutils. Mine was multiple minutes. And when GCC took 30 BU, I was just waiting for hours to compile it

[23:01:52] <symgryph> although there are lots of bargains if you don't mind using amd chips.
[23:02:03] <symgryph> relatively nice graphics processor for 'free'
[23:02:04] <pretty_dumm_guy> riv: I would say multiple reasons. But from logistic point of view, I believe lean manufacturing methodology played a big part.
[23:02:51] <symgryph> I also find looking around really helps, or using 'older' stock if you can put up with it. I am mostly O.K. on the computing front.

[23:05:41] <symgryph> I bought the 'older' threadripper the 12 core two years ago. Stacked it out with ram and its NICe. VERY fast, and heats up cold rooms nicely.
[23:07:08] <jj5> I'm still limping along with a Intel Core i7-7700K from 2017...

[23:27:43] <kline> alternatively just face up to the fact that trying to evade pervasive surveillance is probably not possible and instead work to change the political mood than enables it
[23:28:35] <symgryph> Pretty much any commodity os (or even worse, bios these days) can be easily booby trapped.
[23:28:52] <c355E3B> Musl is not a good libc though
[23:28:54] <symgryph> just use a journal that is written with a lock and key if you really worry about security.
[23:29:06] <c355E3B> more than half of the issue I see at work can be traced to it getting somewhere in the stack?
[23:29:18] <symgryph> I mostly like mUSL (I am an alpine diehard), and use it on openwrt thought.
