[00:17:36] <redbrass> kittonian: did you remember to add the -it param to the docker run command (I only got part of that conversation..)  The -i makes it interactive, the -t emulates a ttty.  So "docker run mycontainer /bin/bash" doesn't work, but "docker run -it mycontainer /bin/bash" does.  (the first works, but then exits rightway as being completed.

[00:18:37] <kittonian> redbrass, i appreciate the response but if you look above I explained that -t is not correct. it's actually -T and yes, that works
[00:18:47] <greycat> They want the opposite of a pseudo-terminal.  They wanted to run their docker-compose (or something) from cron.  With no interaction, no terminal.
[00:19:50] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@172.56.2.32)
[00:19:52] <redbrass> ahh.. I can't think of a use-case for that, but if it is what they want.. :)  Maybe it's the difference between a normal shell and a login shell.. (which I still find confusing)
[00:20:08] <greycat> No, it's not about login shells.
[00:20:33] <redbrass> np.  He got it working so he has a solution.. good enough for me.. :)
[00:21:00] <redbrass> and I'm only loosely in the room, so I'm missing a lot of context...
[00:21:16] <kittonian> redbrass, the use case is that you need to run a command every 5 minutes via cron for nextcloud. In order to do that through docker-compose, you need to write a separate script to cd to the directory and then run the docker-compose command. This means a -T option in the docker-compose command so that you don't get the no TTY error

[00:23:03] <redbrass> kittonian: that still doesn't sound right to me.  I'm familiar with Docker/Docker-compose.  That approach would be the same as rebooting a system every 5 minutes.  Normally I would want to run the docker/docker-compose commands once, then setup cron inside that container...
[00:23:22] <redbrass> again though - I'm missing context, so my comments are likely not on target.

[00:23:47] <kittonian> redbrass, no way. if you setup a cron job inside the container, and then do a docker-compose down, you lose that cron job
[00:24:26] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@172.56.2.32)
[00:24:57] <kittonian> and it's not the same as rebooting a system. the nextcloud cron command updates data and syncs everything. has nothing to do with restarting a system
[00:25:01] <redbrass> kittonian: mount configs into container, then part of your startup process reads those configs and sets up the environment you need - such as cron in this case.  Then taking the image down then up is consistent.
[00:25:03] *** Joins: bebop (~sig@dialup-208-98-133-190.fmtc.com)
[00:25:47] <kittonian> nope, this is not a config that you would volume mount. it's a php file specific to the nextcloud version, so you need to run it from the container
[00:25:58] <redbrass> kittonian: I understand.  But launching a container is akin to starting a computer.  The same boot steps are run when the container starts up (depending on the boot sequence was configured for that image)
[00:26:09] <kittonian> yes, i know
[00:26:23] <kittonian> i was just explaining the use-case that you said you couldn't understand
[00:26:42] <kittonian> it's pretty normal to use the system cron to do certain things within containers using the exec command
[00:27:04] <kittonian> you don't always want to build your own docker image (and honestly, there's no need a lot of the time)
[00:27:31] *** Joins: amacater_ (~amacater@77.97.174.253)
[00:27:56] <kittonian> but yes, in this case I did build my own nextcloud image and yes, I could have that image add the command to the container itself each time it comes up, but i'd rather keep everything in a single crontab file so I can easily see what's going on
[00:28:04] <redbrass> :) thanks.  I'm not familiar with nextcloud.  Make it work for your setup.  That is the "right" solution.  Anything else from the peanut gallery (i.e. me) is just "discussion"

[00:47:00] <PerfDave> Generally speaking running multiple daemons inside a container, using some kind of init, is bad form. Nextcloud runs a web server (or FPM, depending on your container version) as its "command", so you need to exec in from outside to run other commands.

[01:26:35] <redbrass> looking for ideas.  I have a custom boot script that starts a custom interactive installation script.  The installation script gathers details (like which drive to install on) and then performs the installation.  I need to automate some testing.  I need to test the installation script runs without error, and that the resulting system can be booted into.
[01:27:54] <redbrass> I can do the installation into a VM (via qemu), and then ssh into the installed system.  So really, how do I test the installation script?  Something like expect?  but the install script runs well before expect would be available.
[01:28:23] <redbrass> (these are debian based installations, so debian tools are fair game...)
[01:28:31] <PMT> i'd probably wire expect to a qemu serial console if possible.
[01:28:51] <PMT> what's the installation script running _in_?
[01:29:01] <redbrass> customer initramfs
[01:29:05] <redbrass> er.. custom
[01:30:12] <redbrass> This is testing our "firmware" installation steps.  Our "firmware" is a debootstrap based image with inhouse debian packages installed.
[01:30:29] <PMT> why wouldn't expect be available if you're building a custom initramfs? just shove it on in.
[01:30:52] *** Quits: greknod28 (~grek@120.88.171.98) (Client Quit)
[01:31:44] <redbrass> that may be an option.  install image has a goal of being 1GB or less, so we try not to install anything the production system would not need.
[01:32:00] *** Joins: greknod28 (~grek@120.88.171.98)
[01:32:07] <redbrass> but for dev purposes, we may need to do a dev initramfs

[01:33:33] <redbrass> that may be getting TOOO technical :)
[01:34:28] <redbrass> (as if doing custom installers, initramfs, deb packaging, and hardware is not too technical already...)

[01:36:17] <redbrass> hmm. I may be missing knowledge here, but we are using xz to compress things where needed.  The custom kernel ONLY has xz support.

[01:41:11] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@135.129.113.40)
[01:41:53] <redbrass> The routine already has to account for compiling a custom kernel, archiving the debootstrap filesystem, etc.  So we are ok with a few extra minutes.  (but I inherited this, so am open to "making it better"...)

[01:43:10] <redbrass> It is not a routine that has to run more than once or twice a day, and we've already accounted for long running processes (like compiling a kernel) by using pre-compiled kernels which can be done when needed out of band..
[01:43:17] <PMT> I don't actually know who wins in a knock-down drag-out between zstd --all-the-knobs and xz --all-the-knobs, or how nonlinear the scales are as you slide each down. But I don't think I expect integer multiple differences unless you're using really extreme setting differences or something that somehow is optimal for one and pessimal for the other simultaneously, so.
[01:43:51] <PMT> I was just remarking that if you're seriously space constrained, depending on how much is already in there, you might be able to cram more, and expect is not necessarily that expensive depending on how much is already there...

[09:36:32] <sney> debian *really* doesn't recommend doing this, because it can easily get out of hand, but the safest way to use a wild 3rd party source is:
[09:36:47] <sney> add the source, install your 1 package, and then remove the source again
[09:38:16] <sney> and if during step 2 apt wants to upgrade a lot of dependency libraries, abort and try getting your software a different way. building it from deb-src is often fairly trivial

[15:19:50] <co0n> Rodon, `text/scripts` is not a mimetype referenced in your file or mine. I think you want to use neovim.desktop as you have configured for text/x-python and others, right?

[18:48:29] <jelly> your telnet to ipv6 localhost succeeded.
[18:49:17] <jelly> ws2k3, can you add a sleep 5 at the beginning of the script, and see if "telnet ::1 27020" disconnects right away or only after 5 seconds
[18:49:59] <jelly> that would answer whether closing of the connection is xinetd's fault or the script just ran and ended

[23:38:25] <PMT> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=465086 it seems like that never actually landed in Debian, in part because the license was "idk someone unknown posted it once" for some of them?

[23:39:12] <redbrass> I'm trying to use expect with a qemu vm.  The vm is started with console output instead of VNC.  The VM uses EFI and I need to "expect" the prompt to change the .nsh script used (we have a "vbox_headless.nsh" script to work with console output properly).  Any familar enough with Expect to handle this situation?
[23:40:05] <redbrass> my 'expect "press any key to continue"' line is not catching the EFI prompt.
[23:41:10] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.25)
[23:41:25] <redbrass> I tried using autoexpect to generate a starting script. It was capturing too much (color codes and more).  I'm not experienced with Expect, so am learning on the go...
[23:43:11] <Blondie101010> no one writes an expect script in one shot
[23:43:21] <Blondie101010> just adapt it to the version that gets the data

[23:47:24] <Blondie101010> put the text output in a file to analyze it and see why it doesn't catch your phrase
[23:48:50] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.25)
[23:49:19] <redbrass> There are color code escape sequences scattered through the output.  I suspect this is part of the issue.  And my console does that thing where the prompt jumps up a few lines into previous output, which probably is also a factor..
[23:49:37] <redbrass> I'm reading up on Expect to see if I can ignore the escape sequences in the output...
[23:50:03] <Blondie101010> yes
[23:50:08] <Blondie101010> no
[23:50:19] <Blondie101010> the line will be the same on every boot

[23:54:26] <tomreyn> do you actually need to work with expect on the uefi 'bios' output? can't you just have a startup.nsh script run and give a callback as soon as it's ready?
[23:56:47] <PMT> I believe I suggested shoving expect inside the thing the VM boots, and was told that getting things approved for adding inside that would be...troublesome.
