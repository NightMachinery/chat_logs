[00:45:46] <johnny> although that was a problem in two parts. turns out companies and people who make web pages really don't wanna share info without their branding, which means the concept of the semantic web couln't take off
[00:46:02] <johnny> and on the technical side, the specs were too complicated to implement
[00:46:34] <rpav> IoT 2.0 goes wearable: the internet of thongs
[00:47:51] <rpav> i think the semantic web was (ironically given the name?) even more meaningless bullshit than the rest wasn't it

[00:53:07] <johnny> hard disagree on that
[00:53:59] <rpav> well, what actual problem people were having did it solve, if no one really found it useful enough to adopt
[00:54:06] *** Joins: pah (~pah@user/pah)
[00:55:15] <johnny> ah.. see the semantic web would have solved problems for users, but not site owners
[00:55:28] <johnny> it made the site owners less valuable which is a main reason it didn't happen
[00:56:21] <rpav> too often i see "XXX would have taken over [because ???], if it weren't for the evil (YYY) suppressing it and forcing everyone to (ZZZ that everyone's actually doing now)"
[00:56:24] <johnny> let's take recipes for example.  if recipe sites used schema.org (or some other) vocabulary to describe hteir recipes, then one could collate all the data from tons of sites withou all the fluff and realy search
[00:56:31] <johnny> eh.. it's just simple greed here, it's not some plot
[00:56:49] <rpav> that's nice but it's one of those "but no one actually wanted that"
[00:57:01] <johnny> it's not "no one"
[00:57:11] <johnny> it's bad for the content creators, not the content consumers
[00:57:19] <johnny> it's great for the consumers!
[00:57:39] <rpav> the vast majority of users are perfectly happy to browse site and look at recipe and even sort through bullshit ads without a care, and don't really want to make a spreadsheet out of the data
[00:58:18] <johnny> oh it's not about making a spreadsheet, it's about being able to create a pretty good search engine to say through a list of ingredients you have and find all the recipes you have tha use it
[00:58:46] <rpav> this assumes more than like 2 people care to _make a search engine_ to sort through data heh
[00:58:59] <johnny> it already sorta happened, it's just not great
[00:59:06] <johnny> it's relying on machine learning instead
[00:59:30] <rpav> i mean there are a ton of hurdles even assuming _some interested group_ makes a search engine that can sort through recipe data, and most of that is "everyone agree to use this standard"
[00:59:36] <johnny> rpav, lots of people however do use facebook's open graphc, which is probably the closest we got
[01:00:09] <johnny> and google does use the product specification from schema.org to describe google products
[01:00:17] <rpav> i'm not really familiar but it sounds like a "good enough" solution established itself
[01:00:20] <johnny> that's part of the semnatic web
[01:00:49] <rpav> i mean, i'm saying all this being firmly in the "we should organize all of our data in such a manner" camp
[01:00:49] <johnny> well i'd disagree about it being good enough, but either way it wasn't going to happen if author attribution wasn't placed at the forefront
[01:01:06] <rpav> it's good enough if everyone's using it and there's not enough will to change it
[01:01:21] <johnny> to me, that was the real failure of the semantic web people. they didn't think of the social concerns only the technical oens

[01:02:18] *** Quits: nojhan (uid443807@lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:02:19] <johnny> and why rss fell off
[01:02:31] <johnny> it was rss that gave people an idea of the potential of the semnatic web
[01:02:34] <rpav> personally i'd be happy just to organize all my _own_ data, and i think that's something i can accomplish
[01:03:16] <rpav> rss is still reasonably around, but i think everyone prefers to gravitate toward "simple click will shovel information at me" vs "manage data feeds"
[01:03:28] <rpav> everyone = most casual users
[01:03:36] <johnny> and in any case we are starting to see some of this happening, just far later than wanted. i have that little google news feed widget on my phoe and it's startign to show tags/categories in the ui
[01:03:59] <rpav> like why go hunt down feeds and subscribe and deal with various readers, when you can just click "like" and the computer will give you more candy like that
[01:04:19] <johnny> well is't it the same thing effectively?
[01:04:28] <rpav> no
[01:04:36] <johnny> i mean one shouldn't have to hunt for things to subscribe to
[01:05:02] <johnny> just clicking the 'like' button makes it more likely such content gets mixed in with your normal stuff
[01:05:08] <rpav> but you do, discovery was always rather hard and never dynamic or fine-grained
[01:05:36] <rpav> like, social media feeds just go through _everything_ and filter it for you, whereas RSS was a bunch of fixed sources that may or may not actually maximize your attention
[01:05:48] <johnny> i did nto mean it that literally
[01:06:05] <johnny> i'm talking about how the content is serialized , not how you get it
[01:06:17] <johnny> it's a different problem
[01:06:30] <rpav> ah, well sure in that respect
[01:06:40] <johnny> like say.. finding the data from an rss feed with metadata vs parsing webpage with a bunch of unnecessary nonsense
[01:06:45] <rpav> but i think the big important thing is how it's all sourced and fed
[01:07:11] <rpav> like RSS is useless if you have a ML-driven feed you constantly train
[01:07:51] <johnny> no it isn't. because it still has to spend all that time trying to guess what keywords are relevant from the text rather than having the tags from rss to asist it
[01:08:00] <rpav> i mean sure you could pick some slightly different way to display it, but by the point you're a skinner-box volunteer do you really care to redecorate ;)
[01:08:08] <johnny> the display isn't the problem here!
[01:08:45] <rpav> tagging isn't nearly as useful as good fulltext search except for manual organization, but that's again wrong-audience
[01:09:12] <johnny> like right now, i'm helping my dad with a wordpress blog and ti automatically adds all that opengraph metadata which is used by those programs you're talking about
[01:10:11] <rpav> oh you mean author-side tags .. dunno how useful those are

[01:26:11] <rpav> i want a network of data and actual objects and not dealing with constantly loading and parsing text or building queries (more text) or whatever
[01:26:47] <rpav> like obviously serialization happens, but that's a different thing than managing files in formats with APIs for parsing and querying
[01:27:18] <rpav> it's "go ask all my indices for things containing ..."
[01:27:20] <johnny> well as an example, let's say you wanted to find all the songs with genre x..  they read in all the files with id3/whatever metaata
[01:27:39] <johnny> and then when you search, you're searching the indexed data
[01:27:53] <rpav> or like, "all my messages are Messages, and i funnel them into this view, and hit reply and send it .. email, irc, etc doesn't matter"

[01:29:54] <johnny> hmm?
[01:29:57] <rpav> i don't want to deal with programs that do things and files that are laid out a certain way
[01:30:46] <johnny> are you talking about actually getting rid of them, or just an abstraction on top that makes it irrelevant ?
[01:31:02] <rpav> like, you might have mp3-encoded-audio as the bytes internally, but the _user interface_ to this doesn't need to be "file.mp3"
[01:31:12] <rpav> no, really getting rid of them and putting them in a kind of database
[01:31:13] <johnny> isn't that how most audio players already work?

[01:31:20] <johnny> minus the getting rid of them
[01:31:52] <rpav> not really.. they have hardcoded, precanned ways of dealing with your library, playlists, etc, rather than simpler composable mechanics
[01:31:54] <johnny> getting rid of them means you can't share it without th database :(
[01:32:23] <rpav> of course you _can_; you're sharing the _object_
[01:32:23] <johnny> for example? i click editing metadata in my player and i don't know that it's id3 or whatever
[01:32:26] <rpav> or some collection thereof

[01:42:24] <rpav> not exactly .. it's more that "if only everyone did X, everything would be better" is probably a fallacy
[01:42:56] <rpav> like, it _may_ be better for _some_ people or some things, but probably isn't really maximizing usefulness for everyone
[01:43:33] <rpav> like "if everyone just switched everything to rust"
[01:43:56] <rpav> or "if only open-source phones took off" or whatever

[14:39:33] <onizu> 		bool operator () (const ListBoxRow& row1, const ListBoxRow& row2) {  --- what is this operator() () ?
[14:39:54] <TinoDidriksen> Looks like a comparator.
[14:40:09] <TinoDidriksen> Usually tests whether A<B
[14:41:25] <onizu> what is the operator () thing?
[14:41:34] <TinoDidriksen> Makes the object callable.
[14:41:47] <onizu> which object?
[14:42:03] <TinoDidriksen> Whichever object that operator belongs to.
[14:42:04] <Haohmaru> onizu this operator() must be part of a struct/class/thing
[14:42:07] <onizu> k
[14:42:20] <onizu> yea, it's a class member
[14:42:21] <Haohmaru> "operator" is a keyword
[14:42:50] <onizu> why does it have double () ?
[14:43:00] <Haohmaru> {} void operator() { return; }
[14:43:00] <geordi> error: declaration of 'operator()' as non-function
[14:43:25] <TinoDidriksen> onizu, same as operator+ or operator[] state which operator it is, then the function.
[14:43:25] <Haohmaru> onizu because there are different operators and this is how you tell the compiler which one you want
[14:43:41] <TinoDidriksen> operator()(args) is same as operator+(args)
[14:43:54] <onizu> ok
[14:43:57] <TinoDidriksen> Need to know which operator we're talking about. This is operator()
[14:44:12] <Haohmaru> .. operator[](args)
[14:44:31] <Haohmaru> then you can use your object like obj[args]
[14:44:46] <Haohmaru> that's how std::vector does it for example
[14:44:54] <Haohmaru> or std::array
[14:46:03] <onizu> Haohmaru: example?
[14:46:17] <Haohmaru> have you used std::vector?
[14:46:21] <Haohmaru> or std::string at least
[14:46:23] <onizu> yes
[14:46:50] <Haohmaru> you know you can do str[11] to grab the 12th char from it
[14:46:52] <onizu> "then you can use your object like obj[args]" --
[14:46:57] <Haohmaru> but string isn't an array
[14:47:22] <onizu> yes, arrayName[index] gives the item at that position
[14:47:24] <Haohmaru> it does contain a pointer to a dynamically allocated chunk of memory tho, but that's hidden
[14:47:53] <Haohmaru> so when you do str[11] you're actually using its overloaded operator[]
[14:48:23] <Haohmaru> which accesses the memory thru the hidden pointer, grabs the 12th char from it, and returns a char to you
[14:48:33] <Haohmaru> so it appears as if you accessed a char array
[14:48:41] <onizu> what will str[11] give you? (if str is a std::string)
[14:48:57] <onizu> the character at 12th position?
[14:49:08] <onizu> ok
[14:49:39] <Haohmaru> { string str = "1234567890ABCDE"; cout << str[11]; }
[14:49:40] <geordi> B
[14:49:41] <onizu> it makes sense as long as we're passing an index to []
[14:49:50] <onizu> but [args] ?
[14:50:16] <Haohmaru> you can make an object that accepts funky things in operator[]
[14:50:17] *** Joins: gggp (~gggp@li2010-23.members.linode.com)

[14:51:45] <MaddHatter> like what std::map does
[14:51:59] <Haohmaru> yeah, std::map can do the string thing
[14:52:55] <onizu> std::map can have strings mapped as indices,
[14:53:31] <onizu> so it's makes sense to do: someMap["firstname"]
[14:53:40] <Haohmaru> sure
[14:53:58] <Haohmaru> and you can make your own class which does funky things like that
[14:54:04] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@218.78.94.61)
[14:54:17] <Haohmaru> it's called operator overloading

[14:54:56] <Haohmaru> maybe it doesn't ;P~
[14:56:31] <Haohmaru> onizu std::string, std::array, std::vector, std::map, all of these are sort of used as data containers, thus it makes sense for them to overload the [] operator and give you an element from the container
[14:56:47] <Haohmaru> an animal maybe isn't exactly a container
[14:57:05] <Haohmaru> or maybe it is, who am i to say
[14:57:07] <onizu> Haohmaru: can you use this example to illustrate: https://wandbox.org/permlink/fRfDpxfECGWUtWRF
[14:57:39] <onizu> maybe Animal is not the right name for this kind of a class
[14:58:10] <Haohmaru> note: this operator() returns bool
[14:58:40] <Haohmaru> ..and it takes two strings as argument, so not sure what's supposed to happen
[14:59:02] <TinoDidriksen> A dog can be a container for many sausages. For a while.
[14:59:17] <TinoDidriksen> More of a FIFO, though.
[14:59:22] <Haohmaru> then it'll turn into a sh*t generator
[14:59:23] <Haohmaru> ;P~
[15:01:39] <Haohmaru> not all operators need to have arguments
[15:02:23] <Haohmaru> you can overload operator() without arguments and use the object as a function
[15:02:26] <onizu> this is what I'm trying to understand: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/976169fa930341a3ac0a3f3911ca0445
[15:02:55] <TinoDidriksen> So it is a comparator.
[15:03:03] <onizu> yes, I know
[15:03:21] <onizu> I'm figuring out how that bool operator() thing works there.. and when is it called
[15:03:24] <TinoDidriksen> So yeah, that'll return whether row1 < row2.
[15:03:33] <onizu> Right
[15:04:00] <onizu> when is bool operator () (const ListBoxRow& row1, const ListBoxRow& row2) called?
[15:04:25] <Haohmaru> somewhere outside probably
[15:04:36] <onizu> no
[15:04:37] <Haohmaru> you'd make an instance of this ElementSorter
[15:04:37] <TinoDidriksen> On line #17
[15:04:44] <TinoDidriksen> GS::Sort (rows.Begin (), rows.End (), *this);
[15:04:47] <Haohmaru> right
[15:04:58] <TinoDidriksen> *this is itself, and it has an op() to call.
[15:05:01] <onizu> the only instance is created at line 54
[15:05:15] <Haohmaru> then that instance is called like: instance(row1, row2) and returns bool
[15:05:16] <onizu> oh
[15:05:29] <onizu> so GS::Sort() calls it
[15:05:47] <Haohmaru> in this case, it seems this GS::Sort() function would do the calling

[15:06:19] <onizu> hmm
[15:07:12] <Haohmaru> GS::Sort() probably takes a reference to an ElementSorter object
[15:07:33] <onizu> this is that Sort() : https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/fc15b76cd34b4551b2ad3fba27791a12

[15:14:20] <TinoDidriksen> onizu, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort#Example also shows a very simple object with op() being used.
[15:14:32] <onizu> ok, will check
[15:14:34] <Haohmaru> where ref is your ElementSorter, and it's calling its operator() which returns bool

[15:15:24] <onizu> i see
[15:15:48] <onizu> why do you say it will end up doing sorter(row1, row2)? from the definition of GS::Sort() ?
[15:15:54] <anyone> remember that, if a class has operator(), obj() is like writing obj.operator()(args...). It's just another boring function call, the name of the function just happens to be"operator()" and that's it.
[15:16:41] <onizu> anyone: ok
[15:16:44] <Haohmaru> onizu GS::Sort() basically uses std::sort() in it
[15:16:49] <onizu> Haohmaru: yes
[15:17:18] <Haohmaru> ElementSorter uses GS::Sort, and passes itself as the 3rd parameter
[15:17:37] <onizu> void	Sort (Ran first, Ran last, BinPred isLess)   Ran is a class - and "first" is a row passed, how is it converted to an instance of Ran
[15:17:49] <Haohmaru> so std::sort() will end up calling the ElementSorter's operator() which compares two rows and returns a bool
[15:18:37] <Haohmaru> onizu it's a template function
[15:18:37] <onizu> interesting.. objects being compared
[15:19:01] <Haohmaru> "Ran" will get replaced by ListRow or whatever it was
[15:19:16] <onizu> kk
[15:19:39] <onizu> what is IS_LESS_CHECK2 (first, last, isLess);?
[15:20:13] <onizu> #define IS_LESS_CHECK2(first, last, isLess)		DBASSERT_STR (first == last || !isLess (*first, *first), "Invalid 'isLess' comparator was passed to an STL algorithm. Did you implement it with '<=' instead of '<'?");
[15:20:14] <Haohmaru> if i have to guess, some sanity check which makes sure that the first element is "smaller" than the second element
[15:20:22] <onizu> that
[15:20:52] <Haohmaru> so it looks like a runtime assert

[16:03:55] <robod34> i heve these symbols unresolved in my code
[16:04:06] <robod34> but i already added includes for windows.h and gdiplus.h, that is all
[16:04:14] <robod34> am I missing something ?
[16:05:00] <ville> !give robod34 undefined reference
[16:05:03] <nolyc> robod34: Undefined reference is a linker error. It's not a compile error. #includes don't help. You did not define the thing in the error message, you forgot to link the file that defines it, you forgot to link to the library that defines it, or, if it's a static library, you have the wrong order on the linker command line. Check which one. (Note that some linkers call it an unresolved external)
[16:05:39] <robod34> ville, thank you , but I am very new to c++
[16:06:07] <robod34> and I do not know how to determine what i have to link, based on the includes i mentioned
[16:06:25] <robod34> please try be more specific
[16:07:09] <vdamewood> robod34: All ville was saying is that #includes are independent of the errors you're getting.
[16:07:25] <robod34> gdi+ is a windows library, so I suppose it is a static one, @ ville
[16:07:43] <ville> it's you who has to be more specific for this to move forward. every toolchain is configured differently
[16:08:05] <robod34> vdamewood, interesting
[16:08:19] <robod34> ville, perfect; ask the right questions
[16:08:30] <ville> oh dear
[16:08:32] <vdamewood> robod34: It doesn't quite work that way.
[16:09:55] <onizu> :)
[16:09:59] <vdamewood> robod34: Keep in mine, people like ville are in here to communicate with peers and share information if they can be helpful, but are often idling in the channel while working on their own projects.
[16:10:34] <vdamewood> (I guess that includes people like me, too.)
[16:11:32] <robod34> ville, i have Microsoft Visual Studio v16.11, as perhaps, the screen capture is indicative of already; Win SDK 10.0, C++ v17
[16:12:05] <vdamewood> robod34: So, how much do you know about linking with libraries?
[16:12:14] <onizu> robod34: look for any .lib files that are part of the library you are using
[16:12:37] <vdamewood> onizu: The libraries involved are Windows's own libraries.
[16:12:56] <robod34> vdamewood, I am aware and i appreciate this; thank you ; but i apologies for being a noob; I do not know almost anything about linking libraries; I know just about .h files
[16:13:35] <vdamewood> Being a noob isn't a problem. Putting the onus of asking the right question on someone who's trying to help is.

[16:14:27] <onizu> I don't understand what's causing that error then
[16:15:13] <Haohmaru> bad linker settings
[16:15:14] <urdh> presumably visual studio doesn't link gdi+ by default (why would it?), so robod34 has to click around in the gui to make sure it does
[16:15:27] <onizu> "symbole extern non resolu" - i think it means 'unresolved external symbols'
[16:16:01] <robod34> yes, that is what it means
[16:16:22] <onizu> I encountered such errors
[16:16:52] <vdamewood> onizu: Actually, I may be wrong about that.
[16:16:56] <onizu> I think I had missed linking some .lib files
[16:18:09] <onizu> robod34: is there any Gdip.lib or something?
[16:19:17] <onizu> gdiplus.lib  -- this is the one it seems
[16:19:53] <vdamewood> It's really annoying that the docs on Microsoft's own site don't list which .libs or .dlls one needs.
[16:20:04] <robod34> onizu, yes
[16:20:18] <robod34> it lists: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/gdiplusimagecodec/nf-gdiplusimagecodec-getimagedecoders

[17:10:57] <rpav> urdh: i remember clunking around through that crap and wondering why anyone used this stuff
[17:11:20] <rpav> though to be fair what i do use doesn't make any pretenses about intuitive-ness
[17:11:47] <urdh> vim?
[17:12:03] <rpav> it was probably the height of usability in 1976 though
[17:12:09] <rpav> nah emacs, but vim similar boat
[17:12:26] <rpav> i'm pretty sure they both at least point you at help/tutorial on start though ;)
[17:12:41] <urdh> so does vs code to be fair
[17:13:01] <rpav> vscode suffers from having a zillion other things going on visually
[17:13:11] <onizu> i use vim in vscode
[17:13:32] <rpav> onizu: in the console thing?
[17:13:37] <rpav> or just like, the keybindings
[17:13:37] <urdh> i used emacs for a while but it's just so much work getting it set up, i don't see the value proposition
[17:13:38] <onizu> no, in the editor
[17:13:50] <onizu> vim key-mapping I meant
[17:14:10] <rpav> urdh: the value is the customization, i.e. "i want it to do this thing when i push this key," you can write a few lines of code and then that happens
[17:14:31] <urdh> at least with vim there's the whole "mouse-free" mindset even if it seems terribly annoying to learn
[17:14:34] <rpav> also people having written everything under the sun, so you can usually find what you want without having to write much
[17:14:40] <urdh> yes yes, M-x butterfly and all that
[17:14:45] <urdh> but you have to know lisp or whatever
[17:14:47] <rpav> ah well emacs isn't very mousey
[17:14:47] <onizu> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim
[17:14:58] <rpav> yeah if you don't know or learn lisp then emacs is not for you
[17:15:36] <onizu> I used to use emacs.. (hurting pinky)
[17:15:52] <onizu> ctrl meta... >.<
[17:15:57] <rpav> rebinding caps lock to control helps with that heh
[17:16:27] <onizu> yea I heard people did that
[17:16:51] <onizu> anyway, this can get into a whole conversation :)
[17:16:59] <rpav> sure
[17:17:15] <onizu> but you can have vim key-bindings in vscode
[17:17:37] <rpav> clangd though helps with all the old editors since they don't have to rely on people writing parsing/etc for new c++
[17:17:58] <rpav> sure i mean, you can have vim bindings anywhere .. emacs has at least 2 modes for that i think
[17:18:12] <rpav> doom emacs is a precanned thing that's based entirely around evil-mode
[17:18:37] <rpav> pretty sure i saw a browser with vim bindings for navigation
[17:18:58] <onizu> I remember keenly chatting with that AI in emacs.. Eliza?

[18:14:33] <rpav> you can parade opinions like a clown, but it doesn't change the fact that your bank has a website, and doesn't use gopher or whatever you imagine would be better (though perhaps you stuff your mattress with cash)
[18:15:27] <LordKalma> PJBoy, "build" in vscode refers to build profiles in a json. If you have the MS microsoft extension for cmake you have buttons in the bottom for that
[18:15:33] <LordKalma> and commands in crtl+shift+p
[18:16:02] <PJBoy> woah
[18:16:05] <PJBoy> I didn't notice that bottom bar
[18:16:07] <rpav> rebinding the palette can be handy .. i use M-x but ctrl-space etc are nice
[18:16:34] <LordKalma> how the fuck didn't you notice the bottom bar that literally fills up with amazing amounts of crap when you open a cmake file?!
[18:16:49] <LordKalma> including *compiler selection* *build type*
[18:16:51] <LordKalma> and all of that good stuff
[18:17:06] <LordKalma> even build, run, and tests...
[18:17:19] <PJBoy> yeah that bar's tiny
[18:17:32] <PJBoy> and I assumed it was just a status bar
[18:17:40] <LordKalma> it has lots of cool stuff
[18:17:41] <PJBoy> no other program ever made puts buttons in the status bar
[18:17:59] <PJBoy> that stuff should be at the top of the window
[18:18:10] <LordKalma> you can change the git repo, click the sync button, and on the right change the language mode, line endings, and all the other things that are there
[18:18:41] <rpav> given the layers of ui crap vscode has, you're sortof forced to start ignoring things from the start ;/
[18:18:47] <PJBoy> yeah that too
[18:19:07] <PJBoy> I wish the icons had text labels
[18:19:09] <PJBoy> god damn
[18:19:10] <LordKalma> vscode is a single screen application, does it really have that many things?
[18:19:15] <PJBoy> the icons are all so vague
[18:19:19] <Haohmaru> VSCrap
[18:19:24] <LordKalma> hover the mouse haah
[18:19:32] <PJBoy> yeah I know
[18:19:34] <PJBoy> but that's whack
[18:19:46] <PJBoy> turns clicking a button into an O(n) job
[18:19:50] <PJBoy> instead of O(1)
[18:20:00] <LordKalma> only until you learn it
[18:20:05] <rpav> also note how close the "discard hunk/file" button is to "commit" iirc
[18:20:13] <LordKalma> hahahah
[18:20:19] <LordKalma> at least it has a confirmation box
[18:20:35] <PJBoy> the windows don't seem to support autohide
[18:20:45] <PJBoy> the panels rather
[18:21:10] <LordKalma> https://i.gyazo.com/190c95b74b7bb0b7096e7e8abed06323.png
[18:21:13] <LordKalma> I do recomend this
[18:21:18] <LordKalma> this setting hahah
[18:21:31] <PJBoy> eh no version control integration here
[18:22:03] <PJBoy> though now you've got me thinking about it
[18:22:41] <LordKalma> have you at least generated a compile_commands yet? :p
[18:22:50] <LordKalma> anyway, you'll take a bit to get used to vscode
[18:22:59] <LordKalma> lots of stuff in there, just like when you learned VS
[18:23:05] <LordKalma> always a discovery experience
[18:25:55] <rpav> did they fix the commit message box being a tiny POS multiline text widget that's not even 80 full columns
[18:26:14] <LordKalma> nope
[18:26:28] <rpav> vscode's shitty git stuff was probably the main thing that lead me to ditch it
[18:26:49] <rpav> also it being slow and hard to extend and poor multi-window support, but
[18:26:59] <LordKalma> it should have an optional VCS menu as a whole page
[18:27:01] <rpav> i like to make reasonable commit messages and i do so a lot
[18:27:21] <rpav> yeah it really ought to open a full real text editor for that stuff .. like _git itself_ does
[18:29:01] <rpav> it's still probably the best interactive debugger, though i'd like to get gdbgui? or something working
[18:29:57] <LordKalma> the VS debugger is far more packed
[18:30:00] <LordKalma> even qt creator
[18:30:04] <PJBoy> yeah I've got my compile commands
[18:30:13] <PJBoy> and it's working great
[18:30:26] <PJBoy> clangd is giving me like a hundred warnings immediately after opening a file
[18:30:40] <LordKalma> was that sarcasm then? hahah
[18:30:42] <PJBoy> I need to make a .clang-tidy
[18:30:49] <PJBoy> nah it's seriously working great
[18:30:51] <LordKalma> ahh you enabled --clang-tidy
[18:30:53] <PJBoy> none of them are false errors
[18:30:54] <LordKalma> without a file
[18:31:01] <PJBoy> it's enabled by default
[18:31:08] <PJBoy> which again
[18:31:10] <PJBoy> is great
[18:31:25] <PJBoy> nothing but good things to say about cmake and clangd here
[18:31:35] <LordKalma> cool. cool. you can pickup my clang tidy if you want of course
[18:31:54] <LordKalma> it's farly agressive but at least I disabled the "THIS ISN'T LIBCLANG CODE" hahah
[18:31:55] <rpav> clang-tidy has a lot of annoying/dumb things enabled by default but at least they're easy to customize

[18:32:26] <LordKalma> nope
[18:32:27] <PJBoy> like if I wanted two .clang-tidy files that I could select between
[18:32:39] <PJBoy> ah well
[18:32:46] <PJBoy> its automatic fixing feature is also
[18:32:48] <PJBoy> insanely good
[18:32:51] <LordKalma> you either do "*,-[something]" or the reverse "-*,[something]"
[18:32:55] <PJBoy> and love how it even works in godbolt
[18:32:58] <rpav> you could probably make a "closer" .clang-tidy, and link it to like, ~/.clang-tidy-strict or whatever

[23:46:04] <ville> AmR: yes you can use std::thread in a qt application. qt has some limitations as to what may and may not be done from different threads, so perhaps the lazy strategy there is to just do qt stuff from a single thread and utilize std::thread for other computations that then eventually "return" results for display
