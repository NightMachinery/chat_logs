[00:06:03] <FromGitter> <theophilusx> @lebensterben OK, will do. I have managed to work out it is to do with lsp, but not sure why. However, just adding the lsp layer results in the nill bindings being added.
[00:10:54] <FromGitter> <theophilusx> Update: Have narrowed down the issue to lsp. Adding the lsp layer adds the 'nil' menu entries.

[05:06:28] <FromGitter> <kpence> Hi everyone. Can I get help with this bug that happens when I try to use a command bound to `C-c C-g` on a line that is long enough to wrap around with visual-line-mode toggled on. I have evil-escape bound to that sequence like is shown here https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape#assign-a-key-binding-directly but it behaves in a very buggy way, where the command doesn't work unless I press the key sequence with a 
[05:06:29] <FromGitter> ... short delay between each key press.
[05:24:17] <FromGitter> <kpence> I'm looking into what visual-line-mode does to figure out why this happens. A quick test I'll do, is seeing if simply activating word wrap causes this issue
[05:26:01] <FromGitter> <kpence> Toggle-word-wrap doesn't seem to work how I was expecting, it doesn't make any evidence changes
[05:26:38] <FromGitter> <seanchen1991> Hello, I'm wondering if it's possible to move my `.spacemacs` config file to a different location than my home directory and point Spacemacs to the migrated config file.
[05:34:03] <FromGitter> <kpence> ok, I figured out a compromise/adequate solution that might work. I figured out I don't need visual-line-mode, and that I can instead just toggle off "line truncation", which doesn't result in the buggy behavior
[05:36:17] <FromGitter> <kpence> oh no it still happens

[05:56:53] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you can simply use a simlink for example
