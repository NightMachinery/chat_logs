[00:00:29] <isekaijin> And, of course you need metavariables, because how can you otherwise specify something that generates (in the Chomskian sense of “generative grammar”) infinitely many axioms?
[00:00:59] <isekaijin> Moreover, you claimed you have written a compiler before, and all of this stuff is *utterly* obvious to anyone who has written a compiler.
[00:01:55] <brownorange> a statement with no interpretation seems identical to what is meant by an axiom scheme, and yet i'm being told it isn't.
[00:02:26] <isekaijin> Why are you even bringing interpretations into the discussion?
[00:02:28] <brownorange> isekaijin, i never said i wrote a javascript compiler
[00:02:46] <isekaijin> It could be a compiler for a toy language.
[00:02:54] <brownorange> isekajin, because an uninterpreted statement, needs variables
[00:02:55] <isekaijin> You have to know what a grammar is, even in that case.

[00:07:03] <isekaijin> JavaScript is a language that I prefer not to even think about, but setting that aside.

[00:49:28] <brownorange> https://pastebin.com/T1FuV4Jd I create a vector of these in the text processor, and so that means i have a vector of metavars?
[00:49:42] <isekaijin> (For example, in C, a block statement is itself just a perfectly good single statement.)
[00:50:19] <tolarz> greenbagels: I figured that such frustrations appear in me from (sometimes subtle versions of) class discrimination and meritocratic values.
[00:51:30] <tolarz> obviously, sometimes i was frustrated because their lack of knowledge meant increased time investment on my side
[00:51:45] <tolarz> but if you're settled on your time investment (e.g., you are paid *and* you are fine by this)
[00:52:05] <tolarz> this might not be an issue.
[00:52:13] <ski> greenbagels : it can be useful, also for oneself, to make it more explicit in which order one has to present such basic concepts that one already (at some implicit level) groks
[00:52:52] <brownorange> @isekaijin in the language no. but by side effect, the stack can nest
[00:52:52] <tolarz> ski: i always present them in Bourbaki's order. What's the problem?
[00:53:04] <tolarz> ski: For primary schooler's I always begin with the definition of magmas.
[00:53:16] <brownorange> you can reference a stack pointer and all that good stuff register typically machines have
[00:53:33] <isekaijin> brownorange: I am afraid that is where I draw the line. A real programming language has to have some form of nesting. Nested data structures, nested statements, etc.
[00:54:05] <isekaijin> brownorange: Otherwise it is just machine language, possibly for a machine that physically does not exist.
[00:54:51] <quantum> greenbagels: I think it helps to first figure out what they know (e.g. rules about similar triangles, basic Euclidean geometry, etc.) as a baseline, and then set an achievable goal to work towards
[00:54:58] <tolarz> (in case it isn't clear: it was an exaggerating joke; I agree with what you said, ski)
[00:55:04] <ski> (also, people learn best in different ways. some are more visual, some more verbal, some more kinesthathic. some want to be pointed more to possible practical applications. some prefer to study stuff more isolated, ..)
[00:55:15] <W> not sure the specific language in question and its nature is all that relevant, besides serving as an example
[00:55:16] <ski> (tolarz : it was clear :)
[00:55:44] <brownorange> so the language itself has no metavars, as i thought, but the compiler had to use one to process syntax into bytecode
[00:56:02] <brownorange> either way atleast
[00:56:17] <brownorange> SSymbol is a real example
[00:56:20] <isekaijin> greenbagels: That is why I just refuse to give particular classes. If I am teaching to a group of 30-40 students, I can afford to assume some background knowledge (e.g., anything taught in high school is fair game), and if students do not have it, then it is their responsibility to acquire it.

[01:07:12] <greenbagels> it depends, i think
[01:07:18] <somiaj> oh it feels like suffering, so it is the managing expectations and teaching students to push through it. One of the main things the development math courses do here is just get students use to working on problems that are longer and longer, with the goal to get students to not give up after 5 mins, then after 10mins, and so forth, so by the time they hit harder classes they can push through and not give up

[01:08:27] <somiaj> I've seen multiple studies show that students who attend good lectures feel they learn more, but know less, while students who do 'active learning' feel they learn less, but know more.
[01:08:49] <W> brownorange, do you feel that your intuition must take precedence over being correct, or being useful? You will not get far if you do - intuition can guide your mathematics e.g. to make it more digestible by readers that share your intuition, but it will lead you astray if you think it is how things must be
[01:08:49] <brownorange> every statement as possible interpretations that make it true/false. some come accompanied with the interpretation, making it decidable. taking a random statement with no interpretation and declaring it as schematic seems arbitrary even if useful
[01:08:54] <qergle> can you define active learning a bit?

[02:51:58] <somiaj> basically if you can make a_n grow faster than |x|^n approaches zero for all |x|>0, it won't converge anywhere.
[02:52:48] <somiaj> I mean |x|^n/n!, and this approaches zero really quickly for small |x|, so it takes a very fast grown sequence to shrink the interval of convergence to {0}

[03:18:17] <switchnode> here's a purely recreational problem:
[03:18:27] <switchnode> suppose you have a discrete time series of binary values, characterized by a probability p, a 'duration' d, and a 'cooldown' c (c, d in N). the values in the time series are given by 'events': each eligible step has probability p of triggering an event, in which case the next d values are 1 and the next c steps are ineligible. all other values are 0.
[03:18:47] <switchnode> what is the mean of an infinite such series? it's straightforward for c = 0 (mu = 1 - (1-p)^d), and there is a (to my mind) rather surprising way to find it when c = d (mu = dp / (1 + dp - p)). but is there an analytic solution for c != d?

[03:41:14] <isekaijin> I know that rank(B) has to be even. If there are vectors v, w such that v^t B w = 1, then set B' = B - B w v^t B - B v w^t B, and rank(B') = rank(B) - 2.
[03:44:13] <isekaijin> So now my question is... Does this imply that the bilinear form v^t B w can be represented by the matrix [0 u 0; u 0 0; 0 0 0] in some basis of F^3, where F is the ground field?
[03:45:44] <isekaijin> A priori, the fact that B has rank 2 only means that there is some invertible matrix P such that P^{-1} B P has a null row. But it does not necessarily imply that there is some invertible matrix P such that P^t B P has a null row.

[05:32:21] <cuppajoeman> really? How does that happen?
[05:32:24] <isekaijin> More generally, if X is an infinite set, then X^2 has the same cardinality as X.

[05:33:21] <cuppajoeman> I don't follow

[05:35:54] <isekaijin> To see that “thickness”, you need additional structure, like a metric, a measure, a differentiable structure, etc.
[05:36:04] <isekaijin> But using just the cardinality of the set, you cannot see that.
[05:36:19] <cuppajoeman> The cardinality of a set is saying of some bijection exists right?
[05:36:39] <isekaijin> Right, two sets have the same cardinality iff a bijection between them exists.
[05:36:49] <isekaijin> But that bijection does not have to be continuous or differentiable or anything.
[05:36:56] <cuppajoeman> I guess I don't realy see the link into axiom of choice
[05:37:03] <isekaijin> It just pairs one from from this set with one point from that other set.
[05:37:20] <Galois> cuppajoeman: maybe you should try some easier topics first.
[05:37:45] <Galois> For example, prove that if you have an injective and a surjective map A -> B (possibly different maps), then |A| = |B|
[05:38:05] <cuppajoeman> For finite sets?
[05:38:09] <Galois> for all sets
[05:38:28] <cuppajoeman> So for infinite sets we have |A| = |B| iff there is a bijection from A to B
[05:38:44] <Galois> that's the definition of equicardinality
[05:38:50] <isekaijin> What Galois is saying is a stronger statement.
[05:38:53] <Galois> the point is, you'll quickly run into situations where you naturally encounter and use the axiom of choice
[05:38:58] <isekaijin> Because it gives a weaker condition for two sets to be equinumerous.
[05:39:19] <cuppajoeman> I guess maybe I have used the axiom, but maybe I didn't know when I used it
[05:39:29] <Galois> learning these situations gives you a MUCH better understanding of why, when, where, and how the axiom of choice is used
[05:39:41] <Galois> much better than having someone try to explain it to you when you don't have the experience
[05:40:23] <Galois> the reason why my particular example is relevant is because you can easily construct injective maps R -> R^2 (duh, I hope)
[05:40:41] <Galois> and you can (not so easily) also construct surjective maps, such as space-filling curves

[05:42:14] <cuppajoeman> So we would have to be showing that there is no such bijection between R and P(R)
[05:43:01] <isekaijin> Diagonalization.
[05:45:29] <isekaijin> Anyhow, I have finally managed to prove that, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2, any conic in P^2 is projectively equivalent to the standard one xz = y^2. I hope this proof is correct.
[05:45:57] <isekaijin> Let Q be the quadratic form that defines the conic, and consider the associated bilinear form B(u,v) = Q(u+v) - Q(u) - Q(v).
[05:46:56] <isekaijin> Since B is alternating, the matrix that represents it has even rank. The rank cannot be 0, because then Q would be a perfect square, but Q has to be irreducible. Hence B has rank 2. (The only other even rank <= 3.)
[05:48:08] <isekaijin> Let v0 be a vector such that B(v0, -) is identically zero, and let H be a complementary plane. Let v1, v2 be a symplectic basis of H.
[05:49:27] <isekaijin> Then, changing to the coordinates corresponding to the basis {v0, v1, v2}, the bilinear form B is represented by [0 1 0; 1 0 0; 0 0 0].

[05:49:49] <isekaijin> Then, changing to the coordinates corresponding to the basis {v0, v1, v2}, the bilinear form B is represented by [0 0 0; 0 0 1; 0 1 0].

[07:32:46] <isekaijin> So you cover things, like, say, Fermat's little theorem and the Chinese remainder theorem, but using Coq? That sounds awesome.
[07:32:53] <Galois> pretty much
[07:33:18] <qergle> the nice thing about number theory as a choice is you don't have to spend inordinate amounts of time understanding the problem statement, and can focus on the axiomatization i guess.
[07:33:42] <Galois> yes, you can quickly focus on the math.
[07:34:24] <qergle> that sounds like a class i would've enjoyed in my student days
[07:34:44] <Galois> the point is, students have a lot of misconceptions about how even simple things like ∃ work

[07:35:02] <Galois> complex analysis is a weak point of proof assistants
[07:35:16] <qergle> by then you're not getting introduced to proofs, though
[07:35:21] <Galois> ∃ is admittedly weird. If you're trying to prove ∃ x, blah blah blah then you get to choose the x
[07:35:35] <Galois> if you're trying to use the fact that ∃ x, blah blah blah, then you _don't_ get to choose the x
[07:35:57] <isekaijin> I actually kinda like how the existential quantifier works in proof assistants based on constructive logic.
[07:36:00] <ysftaha> wait, cant you assume that it is some constant?
[07:36:07] <isekaijin> It is different from classical mathematics, but in a good way.
[07:36:11] <Galois> this simple fact is confusing to students when they are thrust into the context of an actually complicated proof, like say the fundamental theorem of arithmetic
[07:37:01] <int-e> ysftaha: if you can casually say "some constant" you won't understand the problem ;)

[07:37:19] <isekaijin> I think of “exists x. P(x)” as a pair (x, proof of P(x)). If you are given a tuple, of course you cannot choose what its components are. They are what you are given.
[07:37:39] <Galois> oh but in Coq (x, proof) is a sig type, not an ex type

[07:38:16] <Galois> the difference is subtle but interesting once you understand the issue. Students usually don't get to that point.
[07:38:24] <isekaijin> Is this related to the fact that Coq makes a distinction between Prop and Set?
[07:38:38] <Galois> it's the difference between existence and constructibility
[07:38:59] <int-e> ysftaha: The idea of having a value without knowing what it is is somewhat surreal. Of course it's also something you get used to in math because it happens quite literally all the time.
[07:39:07] <Galois> you can, if you wish, assume that everything that exists is constructible. This reduces Coq to more or less classical logic.
[07:39:13] <qergle> do you see eureka moments when your students begin to take note of the difference
[07:39:14] <qergle> ?

[07:39:47] <Galois> I know one student has gotten there. He started proving theorems with an extra ! specifically so that he could construct the result.
[07:39:56] <Galois> i.e. ∃ ! x instead of just ∃ x
[07:40:18] <qergle> is \exist! in Coq what we all know it to be? unique existence?
[07:40:21] <isekaijin> Wow, Coq lets you write “there exists a unique”?
[07:40:41] <Galois> uh, yes? Coq supports all of math. I'm at the point where if I know math I can Coq it
[07:40:43] <ysftaha> Galois: What do you use for coq? Emacs?
[07:40:55] <Galois> yes, emacs, hence the original discussion about how emacs on windows is awesome
[07:40:58] <ysftaha> "I Can coq it" lmao
[07:41:10] <ysftaha> I'm too childish for this conversation
[07:41:17] <qergle> is there any benefit to emacs for coq over anything else, say vim?
[07:41:27] <isekaijin> My impression from logic class was that, if you really wanted to formalize “there exists a unique”, then you had to first prove “there exists”, and only then prove “it is unique”, which seemed like a PITA.
[07:41:29] <Galois> Coq in vim is somewhat unmaintained.
[07:41:53] <Galois> yes, that's how Coq handles it. "there exists x" and "if any other x' exists then x' = x"
[07:41:53] <qergle> what needs maintaining, the syntax highlighting?
[07:42:01] <Galois> just general working-ness
[07:42:27] <Galois> the other popular option is vscode (open source IDE by Microsoft)
[07:42:48] <Galois> vscode supports other languages of course (C, javascript, whatever) and the Coq plugin is well maintained
[07:42:57] <ysftaha> Galois: my introductory proofs professor keeps talking about (mathematical maturity and how it is the goal of this class). In your experience how long do students take to get to that point where they can see a proof roughly, before starting with a couple of wrong approaches?
[07:42:59] <Galois> if you're doing Lean, vscode is the recommended IDE
[07:43:01] <qergle> then what happens, you run it through the coq interpreter that verifies it?
[07:43:18] <Galois> the IDE (emacs or vscode) runs Coq for you and shows you the result at each step
[07:44:02] <Galois> ysftaha: I assign easy theorems which actually have pretty hard proofs (fundamental theorem of arithmetic is an example), so it takes a good while for students to construct proofs
[07:44:33] <Galois> of course their initial approaches are all wrong (not just approach to that proof, but to proofs in general)
[07:46:10] *** Joins: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato)
[07:46:13] <Galois> the philosophy is that math is a language and you have to speak the language and practice the language in order to learn it. A proof assistant just does one thing. It lets you practice speaking the language without requiring me to be there beside each student as they're working on their problems.
[07:46:14] <ysftaha> (note: I'm a CS student) this class is structured as propositional -> first order -> set theory, relations, funcitons -> graph theory. Should I just continue trying the proofs with trial and error like a madman or is there a shortcut to getting good at such proofs?
[07:46:47] <Galois> ok, how did you get good at English? was there any shortcut you could take to learn that language?
[07:47:14] <ysftaha> shows. 100%. 4 years ago I had no idea how to start a convo.
[07:47:25] <Galois> answer is no. It's a lot of practice, a lot of repetition, a lot of just doing it on your own or with others.
[07:47:38] <Galois> babies have an easier time because big humans think they're cute and talk to them all the time
[07:47:41] <qergle> immersion is also helpful
[07:47:56] <ysftaha> qergle: why do you think Im hanging out here?
[07:47:59] <ysftaha> lol
[07:48:21] <Galois> the problem with "trial and error" is that students often can't tell if their proof is correct or not
[07:48:26] <qergle> if your newspaper is in french, the tv is in french, you have to buy your groceries in french, etc...
[07:48:47] <ysftaha> I mean I can tell when I get stuck and just redo the proof
[07:49:02] <Galois> yes, past a certain point of skill, you can tell
[07:49:18] <Galois> I teach first-year students. They're not there yet.
[07:49:28] <Galois> Coq solves this problem. The program tells you right from wrong.
[07:49:57] <ysftaha> I understand from this that you suggest I start practicing within coq?
[07:52:13] <Galois> not exactly
[07:52:30] <Galois> it's hard to get started on your own. If it were that easy I wouldn't be worth my professor salary.
[07:53:24] <Galois> but I think most of propositional logic and first-order logic is naturally built into Coq, so that's easy enough to start, if you are interested
[07:53:38] <Galois> set theory is NOT built into Coq. You have a number of options here, of varying quality.

[07:59:59] <Galois> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFC
[08:00:33] <Galois> if you assume sig types = ex types as I mentioned earlier, the C turns out to be unnecessary -- it is a consequence of universal constructibility
[08:00:35] <ysftaha> yep, easily over my head
[08:01:00] <Galois> (if you can universally construct every object that exists, then you have actually a very powerful form of the axiom of choice)
[08:01:37] <PlanckWalk> Is that similar to V=L?
[08:02:15] <Galois> I think so, but it's more directly related to the hilbert epsilon operator
[08:02:30] <Galois> (which bourbaki famously renamed tau even though the hilbert tau operator is a different thing)
[08:03:10] <Galois> and then bourbaki tried to base EVERYTHING off of the epsilon operator, which results in crazy outcomes like 1 requires 10^17 symbols to define
[08:03:18] <PlanckWalk> Haha
[08:03:45] <Galois> (if you unrolled the definition of 1 in bourbaki the result would be a string of 10^17 raw symbols)
[08:04:31] <Galois> the milder form of constructibility says "if something exists uniquely then you can construct it". This form doesn't imply the axiom of choice but it does imply the law of the excluded middle
[08:05:28] <PlanckWalk> Interesting, I haven't studied various forms of constructibility properties.

[08:23:14] <ysftaha> you are a prof at uwaterloo?
[08:23:31] <Galois> in normal programming you have something that sorta works, but there's a bug, so you "debug" the bugs out until you think it actually works
[08:23:48] <Galois> debugging doesn't actually rule out all bugs, it's just fixing all the bugs you find (there could be others)
[08:24:30] <qergle> in my example, say, you have some conjecture on the distribution of primes and that relies on rh. so you can check "were rh true, would this argument hold" then with a "yes" in hand you can set out to prove rh.
[08:24:41] <Galois> when "programming" Coq, either you have a good proof, and it's straightforward to work out the minor issues, or your proof is just completely flawed, and you can't "debug" you have to restart from scratch
[08:24:44] <qergle> this is where i was going, to zero in on parts

[08:26:18] <Galois> a flawed proof isn't something you debug until it becomes correct. Normally you just have to throw it away.
[08:26:27] <Galois> you can debug _statements_. That happens all the time.
[08:26:39] <qergle> ok so for coq, rh would be no different than an axiom, when checking proof good given rh true.
[08:26:43] <Galois> you mis-state a theorem, ignoring a corner case. Then you try to prove it and coq shoves the corner case in your face.
[08:26:55] <Galois> so you go back and adjust the statement and continue.
[08:27:51] <qergle> or correctly state a theorem but ignore a corner case whilst proving that coq reminds you (or makes you aware) you need to patch
[08:28:59] <qergle> hrmmm, i guess that's a statement issue.
[08:29:16] <qergle> like you forgot to state in the theorem "for n≠0" or such
[08:29:23] <Galois> if it's just a case in a proof, those aren't really bugs, they're often things that you just wouldn't prove normally because they're not worthy of comment
[08:29:51] <Galois> if it's a case in a theorem statement, then yeah, that's a bug. Everything in Coq is bug-free. It's really different from normal programming.

[10:34:51] <joebobjoe> but how do I solve the equation to figure out how much bigger the pizza must be
[10:35:02] <joebobjoe> what percentage bigger must it be
[10:35:11] <PlanckWalk> First set up the equation, then solve it
[10:35:40] <joebobjoe> ok uh
[10:35:40] <PlanckWalk> E.g. suppose marty's pizza is size M, Luis' size L.  4/6 M > 5/6 L

[10:36:23] *** Quits: Trigo (~NeedMathH@64.201.115.44) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[10:36:51] <joebobjoe> so I divide both sides by 5/6
[10:37:08] <PlanckWalk> That's allowed
[10:37:20] <PlanckWalk> I'd divide by 4/6 though
[10:37:33] <joebobjoe> so I get 0.8 M > L
[10:37:38] <PlanckWalk> Giving M > (5/4) L
[10:37:52] <joebobjoe> so L's pizza must be 80% of M's pizza
[10:38:01] <joebobjoe> oh ok
[10:38:11] <PlanckWalk> Which can be written as  M > (125/100) L
[10:38:11] <joebobjoe> you got the answer I was looking for thanks I got the opposite
[10:38:31] <joebobjoe> so it must be a fourth larger
[10:38:48] <joebobjoe> isn't that the correct answer to the math problem on reddit?
[10:38:59] <joebobjoe> "the pizza must be bigger" is not the correct answer to me
[10:38:59] <PlanckWalk> At a fourth larger, they eat the same mass of pizza.
[10:39:06] <joebobjoe> oh
[10:39:11] <joebobjoe> it must be greater than a fourth larger
[10:39:16] <joebobjoe> thanks, bro
[10:39:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes, anything more than a fourth larger.

[12:38:28] <damo22> if you let f(x) = {+inf if x=0, 0 elsewhere} then it integrates to the step function right?
[12:39:11] <damo22> thats some kind of delta function
[12:39:39] <somiaj> damo22: the delta-function isn't really a function and I don't think you interpirted the question correctly.
[12:40:29] <somiaj> piou: For any riemann sum that uses x=0 as a test point, you'll get the riemann sum is Delta x, while for all other riemann sums you get 0.
[12:41:04] <somiaj> piou: if you take the limit as Delta x->0 of that rieman sum  you also get zero, so no matter what riemann sum you use, the limit of them will approach zero, making that function riemann integral
[12:42:15] <piou> somiaj: oh, right, if I take the riemann sum over [0,+inf[ then I'll always have a "first rectangle" of height 1 but ever shrinking width, so it does work to converge to 0, and so it is integrable on IR with value 0
[12:42:30] <piou> Thanks for the insight
[12:42:36] <somiaj> well you can't take a riemann sum over [0,inf), because by definition it must be a closed and bounded interval
[12:42:59] <somiaj> but if you use any, [a,b] that contains zero, you'll still get at most Delta x, which will approach zero as you make finer and finer partitions.
[12:42:59] <piou> Yes, right
[12:43:19] <rex-> piou: in general you can change a riemann integrable function on finitely many steps without changing integrabililty and the value of the integral
[12:43:28] <rex-> s/steps/points
[12:43:44] <piou> I see that now
[12:43:50] <piou> That's nice
[12:43:59] <somiaj> you can even do it on a set of measure zero and not change the integral
[12:44:22] <somiaj> oh wait nevermind...grr, I'm thinking of something else
[12:44:25] <rex-> that'd be Jordan meausre in case of Riemann?
[12:44:31] <somiaj> non-dense sets of measure zero.
[12:44:42] <piou> Ok, yeah, that makes more sense
[12:45:18] <rex-> are there non-dense sets of measure zero with more than finitely many points?
[12:45:30] <piou> {1 if x is rational, 0 otherwise} over [0,1] ?
[12:45:46] <piou> Ah, that's dense
[12:45:54] <somiaj> rex-: 1/n for n in N
[12:45:54] <rex-> and has infinitely many points :)
[12:46:14] <somiaj> though it does have a single cluster point
[12:46:52] <somiaj> I know there is some theroem about riemann integrals and sets of measure zero, maybe it is about discontunites, but for the standard 1 if x is rational, 0 otherwise, the set of discontinuites is not measure zero.
[12:47:07] <rex-> so f(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some n ∈ ℕ and 0 elsewhere is riemann integrable around 0?

[12:49:47] <somiaj> A function is riemann integrable on a rectangular box in R^n if and only if it is not continous at most on a set of measure zero, I did recall some theroem about riemann integral functions and sets of measure zero.
[12:50:57] <somiaj> rex-: you can probably use upper and lower deboux integral on that function to prove it, but in this case since the points of discontiunity {1/n} u {0} is a set of measure zero, it would be riemann integrable
[12:51:38] <damo22> so f(x) = 0 when x \in N or 1/x otherwise
[12:52:02] <rex-> yeah I was thinking about that the upper and lower would be different, but yes I need only one ε step from 0, to get around the issues and ε can get arbitrarily small. So it seems like the border of Riemann Integrabililty :)

[12:55:04] <piou> somiaj: why did you say "for the standard 1 if x is rational, 0 otherwise, the set of discontinuites is not measure zero"?
[12:55:26] <rex-> but a good refreshment of memory :), all that was stuck inside my head was to switch to lesbegue integral if you deal with crazy stuff :)
[12:55:51] <somiaj> piou: that is the classic example of a function that is not riemann integrable (But lebesgue integrable)
[12:56:14] <piou> somiaj: sure, but as a measure, rational numbers are countable so the measure should be 0 no?
[12:56:18] <somiaj> piou: and that function is discontious everywhere on [0,1], which is not a measure zero set.
[12:56:30] <somiaj> piou: sure but it is also discontinoous at all irrationals too
[12:57:13] <somiaj> hence why my example of using 1/n for the countable set works, because the points of discontinuties are now just {1/n} u {0
[12:57:17] <somiaj> and not everything
[12:58:40] <rex-> I think here the issue is, that there are different measures used; for Riemann you use Jordan measure, but for Lebesgue lebesgue measure (ot at least Borel measue)
[12:59:08] <rex-> and I don't think that the rationals in [0,1] are measurable
[12:59:16] <rex-> in Jordan Measure
[13:01:16] <piou> I only use Lebesgue measure because I'm not familiar with Jordan. With Lesbesgue measure the measure of a countable set is zero, so the measure of 1_Q over [0,1] should be zero. I guess my misunderstanding comes from the fact that you're talking about the set of discontinuities and not just the set of rationals?

[13:03:59] <rex-> but mixing Riemann integra and Lebesgue measure will lead to problems

[15:57:55] <sek> it is 1 point
[15:58:20] <sek> it is not 1 point on anything, it lives in isolation. Of course you can consider its embedding as a subscheme of A^1, but that's extra information
[15:58:50] <sek> topologically, ie also set theoretically it is 1 point. On the other hand its sheaf is different from the sheaf of say Spec(k)
[15:59:38] <isekaijin> Okay, but even then, it is twice the same point. If you consider the Chow group, the element of the group corresponding to the whole space will have a big fat coefficient 2.

[16:18:28] <sek> the degree of the intersection should just be d1*d2*d3 where di is the degree of each surface

Can I find a subset S of c_1, …, c_n  such that  the sum on S  of c_j is equal to the sum of c_j on the complement of S.   The second  problem(0-1-KNAPSACK ):  given an integer K can I find a subset S of c_1, …, c_n  s.t. the sum on S of c_j is K.    I have to show that the problem 0-1-KNAPSACK can be reduced to PARTITION.    I was given the hint
[16:51:15] <tomtomgps> transform the input   (c_1,……,c_n, K)  for 0-1-KNAPSACK to  the input (c_1,……,c_n, c_{n+1} , c_{n+2}) where c_{n+1} = 2M and  c_{n+2} = 3M - k  where M = sum of c_1 to c_n.     I’m trying to verify that this works well, so If I suppose I have a partition for (c_1,……,c_n, c_{n+1} , c_{n+2}) that means each set of the partition has vlaue 3M-K since the sum of every element gives 6M-2K.  So it means I can add elements in c_1 to c_{n+1} to create k

[18:44:33] <greenbagels> Guest7673: hmm
[18:44:45] <greenbagels> i think u substitution might work; is there a trig identity you can use
[18:44:54] <Guest7673> I tried u-sub, but got confused. Here is what i did
[18:45:41] <Guest7673> u = sqrt(tan(x)) -> du = (1/2)(tan(x))^(-1/2)*sec^2(x)dx.  How do we handle this tan(x)^(-1/2) ?
[18:45:52] <greenbagels> try this instead
[18:45:59] <greenbagels> rewrite it with sec^2 = 1+tan^2
[18:46:15] <greenbagels> you know d/dx tan(x) = sec^2(x)
[18:46:26] <Guest7673> you mean just write u = tan(x)?
[18:46:30] <greenbagels> yes
[18:46:38] <Guest7673> ok, one second
[18:46:40] <greenbagels> and then play with the sec^4 to make it subsitute-able
[18:46:47] <greenbagels> because ify ou dont, you get a du^2 back and that doesn't work
[18:47:36] <Guest7673> so we get integral u^(1/2) (1+u^2)du
[18:47:39] <Guest7673> which is much easier

I am not much of a homotopy theory person (actually, not at all), but I realized that, in some contexts, ideas from homotopy theory are kind of inevitable.

[21:25:10] <greenbagels> ah i see
[21:25:52] <Sofia> I am trying to split the unit circle into even areas (and want to do so horizontally/vertically). I split up the line for; x + y = 1; into a rectangle plus a triangle on the left, and a triangle on the right as: 1/2 - (1 - x)^2 = x + x^2 + x^2 / 2. The solution for this is: 1 +/- 1 / sqrt 2. Is my reasoning correct such that the square root of this result defines the line I want to split my circle
[21:25:54] <Sofia> by? Eyeballing it, it looks correct. But I'm not sure how to go about verifying this.
[21:26:47] <Sofia> (Obviously only 1 - 1/sqrt 2 makes sense here. But it is a +/-, technically.)
[21:27:54] <qergle> what does "split the line for; x+y=1; into a rectangle plus a triangle" mean?
[21:27:58] <greenbagels> yeah
[21:28:25] <greenbagels> if you want to split the unit circle centered at (a,b), you just have the lines y=b and x=a
[21:29:58] *** Joins: freemint (~freemint@l129.fem.tu-ilmenau.de)
[21:29:59] <Sofia> x + y = 1, is a trianagle. I split it such that the area under each half is equal. For the line, this is exactly 1 - 1/sqrt 2 = 1/2 - (1 - x)^2 = x + x^2 + x^2 / 2.
[21:30:26] <Sofia> greenbagels: By horizontally/vertically I meant xor. Only one dimension.
[21:30:37] <qergle> what does "x + y = 1, is a triangle" mean?
[21:31:03] <Sofia> With respect to the positive quandrant of its graph.
[21:31:20] <Sofia> Rather x + y <= 1, x >= 0, y >= 0.
[21:31:21] <cherim> Where is the unit circle here though...
[21:31:22] <qergle> ok, so you mean the triangle bounded by x-axis, y-axis and line x+y=1?
[21:31:33] <qergle> is the circle centered at (0,0)?
[21:31:35] <Sofia> Yes
[21:31:39] <Sofia> Yes
[21:31:52] <qergle> ok, i see a triangle now. where's your rectangle.
[21:32:10] <greenbagels> isekaijin: i just now saw "homotopy theory-pilled" and chuckled
[21:33:05] <greenbagels> i'm still confused; if you want a horizontal line, just pick the x axis; if you want a vertical line, just pick the y axis
[21:33:09] <greenbagels> im not sure what the goal is here
[21:33:27] <Sofia> At the mystery point x along the line `x + y = 1`, the rectangle is between this point and the origin.
[21:33:47] <Sofia> The other triangle is the remaining area above the rectangle, still below the line, on the left side.
[21:34:02] <qergle> ok, so once you draw this, your intial triangle is partitioned into two smaller triangles and rectangle.
[21:34:02] <greenbagels> or are you trying to split it into more than two regions...?

[22:26:26] <Sofia> cherim: Can you describe your suggestion here?
[22:29:39] <cherim> It's easier to describe it in https://sketchtoy.com/70223172 . If you want area of green to be 1/k of red+green area, then the side of the green should be 1/sqrt(k) of the side of red+green
[22:30:02] <cherim> If the corners are still (0, 0), (0,1), (1,0), then x=1-1/sqrt(k)
[22:30:27] <cherim> But you can apply any affine transformation to the picture, this anwser won't change

[23:36:09] <isekaijin> someone235: Because, if you have two nested rings A \subset B, then the elements of B that are integral over A form an intermediate ring A \subset C \subset B.

[23:36:48] <isekaijin> And I am sorry, you really need to know about rings and modules for this.

[23:38:47] <isekaijin> A ring is a set that contains two distinguished elements called 0 and 1, together with three operations called “addition”, “subtraction” and “multiplication”, which satisfy some of the usual properties of these operations in the familiar numerical setting.

[23:52:24] <isekaijin> Are there any rings without unit that are particularly useful, other than the Schwartz space (where multiplication is either the usual one or convolution)?
[23:52:42] <isekaijin> And, no, “ideals of a ring with unit are rings without unit” does not count.
[23:54:27] <isekaijin> Of course, as someone who is primarily interested in algebraic geometry, 99% of the rings I work with are commutative rings with unit, and 99% of the remaining 1% are rings of matrices with entries in a commutative ring with unit.
[23:56:00] <newpy> I have a matrix D(I - g*P) with 0 < g < 1, P is a stochastic matrix (each row sums to 1), D is a diagonal matrix summing to 1
[23:56:12] <isekaijin> But removing commutativity does not seem as bad as removing the requirement of a unit element. In particular, noncommutative rings seem necessary to model observables in quantum mechanics.
