[01:26:20] <sham1> Anyway, since there was some talk about list procedures, I do have a question about (append) in R7-small. Basically, what should be the interpretation in the case like `(append '(1 2 3) '(4 . 5) '(6))`, let's say. Chibi for example gives (1 2 3 4 6), while Gauche, CHICKEN and so on error out, saying that '(4 . 5) has the wrong type, which at least I find to be more intuitive. The problem seems to
[01:26:22] <sham1> be that R7RS doesn't really say anything about this, although given the signature it would imply that it should error on non-proper lists that are not the last one, which it special cases
[01:26:49] <sham1> Is this something that might be clarified or is either interpretation valid/

[01:45:23] <mnieper> sham1: All but the last argument must be proper lists in R7RS.
[01:45:40] <mnieper> But an implementation does not have to signal an error.
[01:46:30] <mnieper> It is allowed to launch a nuclear weapon instead.
[01:47:10] <mnieper> It's in 1.3.3. "Entry format" of the R7RS.
[01:52:02] <sham1> Ah, alright
[01:53:45] <jcowan> I'm composing an email in response to dpk's current list.  My take on comparators is to use them where multiple functions are needed only.
[01:55:41] <mnieper> sham1: If you want precise and guaranteed error reporting, you currently have to look for R6RS. R7RS large will possibly include at least a mode or an option where it is strict with respect to errors, but we aren't there yet.
[02:07:54] <jcowan> That said, few if any Scheme implementations are unsafe in that sense, modulo bugs.
[02:09:05] <mnieper> Few will crash unless in some optimizing mode. But the Chibi example shows that even when the program does not crash some programmer's mistakes will get unnoticed.

[15:00:59] <amazigh> I do not recall what was the rationale to build an ad-hoc R5RS implementation
[15:01:28] <amazigh> given the large number of existing implementations
[15:02:32] <amazigh> I heard a similar story in the early 2000s where a company built their own LISP on top the JVM to build somekind of game appstore for mobile devices
[15:03:10] <amazigh> I was said that was necessary because mobile platform did not allow to compile programs on the fly
[15:03:59] <sham1> I see they are targetting iOS
[15:04:04] <amazigh> anyway, it is unlikely people stop building ad-hoc small-ish languages for production
[15:04:19] <sham1> Or well, if it's the JVM it might also be early android
[15:05:42] <mdhughes> I've shipped my little LISP-like interpreter on iOS, for that reason. No "interpreters" allowed but actually Apple didn't care as long as you weren't downloading code to run.
[15:05:49] <amazigh> it is still unclear why they need to compile the games on-the-fly
[15:06:09] <amazigh> oh then it should have been an interpreter ^^
[15:07:05] <mdhughes> You don't compile the scripting code, usually. You could, it'd be faster, but that's not the bottleneck. Dev time is, and being able to update the game model in text instead of adding case statements and recompiling a big ObjC app was a win.

[15:59:39] <sham1> Apparently chibi's proper-list? and dotted-list? are out of spec since they don't gracefully deal with circular lists. The first one is particularly interesting considering that the list? works as intended by both R5 and R7-small, rejecting circular lists instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop. Seems like I'll have bugs to report
[16:01:30] <dpk> weird. proper-list? can an should just be a re-export of list?, i think
[16:01:42] <sham1> Indee DDD 
[16:03:33] <sham1> But it uses a distinct implementation in Chibi's SRFI 1. While dotted-list? is simply defined as (not (proper-list?)) which is of course wrong even if proper-list? is correct

[16:17:09] <sham1> And the user expects that because it's in the document that literally specifies the procedure
