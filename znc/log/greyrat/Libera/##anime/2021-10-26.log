[16:26:47] <sentionics> saganman: yeah. I see townhouses in my area-ish at like 80 - 125k
[16:27:12] <sentionics> still not terrible on that note, but yeah, I don't know shit about the associated HOAs though.

[16:35:51] <sentionics> nice man, good to hear, mate
[16:35:52] <saganman> but honestly sentionics, I gotta say with most good intentions, you gotta drink less man. It is worrying.
[16:36:20] <sentionics> I actually went just shy of 2 weeks this time of continuous sobriety
[16:36:28] <sentionics> I'm working on it... just not perfect results.

[16:37:09] <saganman> yeah, it's morning now
[16:37:13] <sentionics> just been drunk the whole time.
[16:37:23] <sentionics> but I feel good, so whatever.
[16:37:28] <saganman> man o man
[16:37:52] <sentionics> I probably can use the reset.
[16:38:02] <sentionics> I'll sleep at 7pm or something and be ok

[16:40:57] <saganman> a drink or two is fine though

[16:42:16] <sentionics> I get severe body sickness though. I feel intense body stress and like I'm dying.

[17:31:16] <amigojapan> hey Cryowolf 
[17:31:38] <saganman> what's it like having sex with vegan?
[17:31:50] <saganman> they don't eat dicks?
[17:31:54] <saganman> ButterNoodle^^
[17:32:24] <Cryowolf> hey
[17:33:07] <Cryowolf> Vegan sex is kind of like a middle school teacher trying to teach you about good manners. You'll be lectured on why eating meat is bad while she's nailing you
[17:33:20] <Cryowolf> except youre not in middle school, obviously

[17:33:28] <Cryowolf> that'd be illegal and immoral
[17:34:03] <saganman> I don't know. I have many friends who are strict vegans but they never have an issue with me eating meat.
[17:34:19] <saganman> have/had*
[17:34:33] <Cryowolf> are they from a western country?
[17:34:49] <saganman> nah, they are indians like me
[17:34:58] <Cryowolf> that would explain it then
[17:35:06] <Cryowolf> Im sorta joking here
[17:35:20] <saganman> ah
[17:35:39] <Cryowolf> but activists in the west (especially the US) are extremely militant and annoying and often refuse to accept people living a lifestyle different to theirs
[17:35:43] <Cryowolf> which is really ironic
[17:35:44] <amigojapan> meat eaters have no beef with vegans
[17:36:17] <Cryowolf> I don't. Eat whatever you want, long as it isn't a person I'm not gonna judge
[17:36:20] <saganman> of course we don't amigojapan, more meat for us :p
[17:36:23] <Cryowolf> If it's a dog or a cat I might judge

[17:37:40] <Cryowolf> yeah and vegans certainly don't have beef with anyone

[17:39:05] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I had that with my dad, he was vegetarian when i was a kid
[17:39:21] <amigojapan> they called it gluten, I odnt know if it was pure gluten

[17:46:10] <Omega037> broccoli?
[17:46:11] <Omega037> Eh
[17:46:18] <Omega037> I mean it is a leafy green
[17:46:21] <Omega037> It has a lot of fiber
[17:46:22] <amigojapan> doesnt all DNA have proteins?
[17:46:38] <Omega037> no
[17:46:47] <Omega037> DNA has base pair nucleic acid
[17:46:54] <Omega037> RNA/DNA encodes proteins
[17:46:56] <amigojapan> I thought the binders of hte double helix were proteins
[17:46:58] <Omega037> it is more like instructions
[17:47:12] <Sxem> Protein accounts for 33% of broccoli's calories.
[17:47:15] <amigojapan> yeah that I know
[17:47:19] <Omega037> there are binding proteins, yes
[17:47:29] <amigojapan> ok
[17:47:41] <Omega037> they interact with DNA though
[17:47:47] <Omega037> I am not sure that they are part of it
[17:47:54] <Cryowolf> it's not 33% per 100g though
[17:48:04] <Cryowolf> 33% of calories is different than of weight
[17:48:05] <amigojapan> its interesting to think even a piece of lelttus is my distant cousin
[17:48:13] <Sxem> yeah its much less by weight
[17:48:26] <Omega037> 2.5g of protein per 88g
[17:48:40] <Omega037> So 2.84% protein
[17:48:56] <Sxem> Nutritional yeast has a lot of protein. they say it tastes like cheese, but i tried it and didnt like it
[17:48:59] <Omega037> Turkey is 8g per 28.4g
[17:49:05] <Cryowolf> if it weren't for processed foods being a thing, there wouldn't be any way to be a healthy vegan
[17:49:16] <Omega037> So 28.2% protein
[17:49:24] <Cryowolf> Omega037, please dont measure in "servings :<
[17:49:30] <Cryowolf> per 100g only ^^
[17:49:54] <Omega037> I have about 4-5 cups of broccoli most days
[17:50:02] <Omega037> And brussel sprouts
[17:50:05] <Cryowolf> eeeew
[17:50:13] <Omega037> I eat mostly lean meat and leafy greens
[17:50:15] <Cryowolf> I eat a lot of meat
[17:50:19] <saganman> wait, rice has proteins?
[17:50:29] <Sxem> i like nuts for protein. if i was vegetarian, id eat lots of nuts and mushrooms and pretend they were meat
[17:50:40] <Cryowolf> about 9-13% protein, depending on the sort
[17:50:40] <saganman> I thought rice are full of carbohydrates
[17:50:45] <Cryowolf> black rice can get up to 15%
[17:50:50] <saganman> I see
[17:50:57] <saganman> I eat brown rice
[17:50:58] <Cryowolf> sure it has carbs too, but carbs arent bad
[17:51:10] <Cryowolf> brown rice/black rice, I meant brown
[17:51:21] <Cryowolf> too many people think carbs are the enemy, they're not
[17:51:33] <amigojapan> they are for di9abetes Cryowolf 
[17:51:36] <Cryowolf> they provide you with nice energy to work out
[17:51:37] <Sxem> i eat like 1.5 cups of food per day
[17:51:42] <saganman> I don't have any enemies Cryowolf 
[17:51:54] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: tomako has been able to quit insulin since she eats few carbs
[17:52:42] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, obviously a medical condition is an exception and not the norm
[17:52:51] <amigojapan> alright
[17:53:19] <saganman> !picks
[17:53:19] <ImoutoBot> saganman: You haven't made any picks yet. Type "!aotw <Anime Title>", "!motw <Manga Title>", or "!hotw <Hentai Title>".
[17:53:34] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I have also lost a lot of weight, and this is the only diet that has ever worked for me, I usually cant follow other diets
[17:53:37] <Cryowolf> I'm trying to say that people avoid carbs when they dont need to. Now if you have a medical conditions where you should, that's quite different
[17:53:47] <saganman> !motw Otomen
[17:53:47] <ImoutoBot> saganman: You've set your pick to Otomen. It will be automatically selected for Manga of the Week when your next turn comes.
[17:54:18] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, then stick with it. You stick with what works for you, that you can continue with for the rest of your life
[17:54:30] <amigojapan> saganman: is that a play on words between otome and men?
[17:54:47] <amigojapan> thanks Cryowolf 
[17:55:07] <saganman> yes amigojapan, kind of and also related to plot
[17:55:16] <Cryowolf> I'm also not saying you have to eat carbs. I'm saying there's no general rule that makes them worse than anything else but each and every person has different wants, needs and so on
[17:55:24] <amigojapan> I see saganman 
[17:55:47] <saganman> amigojapan: the mc of Otomen likes all things shojo but he hides them because of what society may think
[17:55:51] <amigojapan> I see
[17:56:00] <saganman> it's a good romance manga
[17:56:12] <amigojapan> saganman: I love shoujo, and i dont hide it
[17:56:14] <Cryowolf> If you can't control your eating habits with carbohydrates because they make your blood sugar crash or gives you a slow insulin response and makes you insulin resistant. So you get cravings to eat again almost immediately. Then carbohydrates might not be for you
[17:56:47] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf 
[17:57:01] <Cryowolf> now you can often avoid this by making meals protein and fiber heavy as well as including a moderate amount of fat and making sure the carbohydrates are the "slow" kind
[17:57:18] <saganman> amigojapan: He is not just into shoujo. He likes flowers, pink stuff and all the other things that are stereotyped as girly stuff.
[17:57:26] <Cryowolf> that way you don't get a quick uptake and then a crash which leads into cravings
[17:57:52] <Cryowolf> I use fast carbs before a workout, or well I did when I was able to work out and will when I can again

[18:00:31] <saganman> it's a very old manga amigojapan, I reread it yesterday.
[18:00:36] <amigojapan> saganman: like tomako likes shounen and I like shoujo
[18:01:02] <amigojapan> saganman: is there an anime?
[18:01:09] <Cryowolf> that's such a reverse amigojapan
[18:01:28] <amigojapan> Yup Cryowolf

[19:51:50] <Bco1981> my wired "gamer" keyboard has a bug

[19:53:01] <Bco1981> i use a static color for all keys... but 1... one freakin' key, is not the same color as the rest.
[19:53:19] <MootPoot> meh - thats not really a problem 
[19:53:37] <MootPoot> LEDs are only useful for button backlighting, aside from that I dont really care about them 
[19:53:38] <Bco1981> if i turn off colors, it still has light in it
[19:53:44] <MootPoot> broke?
[19:54:43] <Bco1981> you can't really see it if the keyboard is doing a rainbow wave... but i don't want that. i just want one static color

[22:44:54] <sentionics> cthulchu: wut
[22:44:57] <Jigsy> [20:14:50] <KatrinValerie> So you can very well consume violent media and be a non violent fella
[22:44:57] <cthulchu> lulz
[22:44:58] <sentionics> cthulchu: I'm not gay
[22:44:58] <Jigsy> Nope.
[22:45:01] <Jigsy> Physically impossible!
[22:45:15] <sentionics> Jigsy, I turn to dust, but I'm not a man lover
[22:45:17] <KatrinValerie> Jigsy: Are you disagreeing with me?
[22:45:25] <cthulchu> you would either become violent or stop consuming that poison
[22:45:27] <sentionics> help me Jigsy
[22:45:29] <Jigsy> That's more of  a tongue in cheek comment.

[22:45:43] <MootPoot> yes

[22:46:23] <sentionics> uh, they say I'm lost
[22:46:28] <sentionics> I can't get a gf
[22:46:33] <sentionics> they say I'm not keen
[22:46:34] <Nanobot> sentionics isn't lost, he's right here.

[22:46:47] <sentionics> Nanobot: I love you brother
[22:46:48] <KatrinValerie> Jigsy: if someone induldges in violent sex fantasies for long enough, they'll end up trying it at some point most likely.
[22:46:49] <cthulchu> but no, uneducated social justice warriors lead the way
[22:46:58] <Nanobot> sentionics has a better chance at getting a girlfriend than I do.
[22:47:06] <Jigsy> Yeah, I don't buy that.
[22:47:08] <sentionics> Nanobot: that's bad
[22:47:14] <MootPoot> Social justice is weird - usually the ideas at their core is fine, but then the twitter mob takes it and runs all the way from one football field to the next school district's field and scores a touchdown there
[22:47:22] <ButterNoodle> "point most likely."
[22:47:37] <KatrinValerie> Which is why so many dumb self help books tell you to imagine yourself to succeed to succceed
[22:47:38] <Jigsy> Social Justice is simply about flexing coefficients.

[22:50:28] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: now this is begining to sound like a twitter debate and when the term social construct comes up things usually go south quickly, cause you'll always end up disagreeing on what the scope of a social construct is and that's a pretty philosophical thing actually.

[22:52:33] <ButterNoodle> KatrinValerie: incorrect there are many different in/out groups that are contained in a social media ecosystem like twitter.. pretty sure you could find people that could construct arguments for/against eating babies on there.. thats not the point - its a micro culture that is built aroung creating conflict where conflict doesnt exist in the real world
[22:52:46] <sentionics> I'm not your trannie mom!
[22:52:51] <Jigsy> its a micro culture that is built aroung creating conflict where conflict doesnt exist in the real world

[23:15:10] <enyc> cth: mains inlet and separate dali pair
[23:15:26] <enyc> cth: but when I looked at a dali scene-setter light-switch, oh dear oh dear! yeesh!
[23:15:46] <enyc> going for switchDIM instead ;p
[23:16:12] <Berlin36> what should i do
[23:16:14] <Berlin36> i mean 
[23:16:18] <Berlin36> i have a lot of freetime
[23:16:21] <Berlin36> so 
[23:16:25] <cth> learn web dev
[23:16:30] <cth> make a site
[23:16:30] <Berlin36> naaaaaah
[23:16:33] <Berlin36>  i tried it
[23:16:36] <cth> and?
[23:16:39] <Berlin36> learned html
[23:16:43] <Berlin36> well easy and stuff
[23:16:47] <Berlin36> learned a bit of css
[23:16:49] <Berlin36> got bored
[23:16:51] <Berlin36> started c++
[23:16:53] <Berlin36> lol
[23:16:54] <cth> lol
[23:16:59] <cth> better start js
[23:17:03] <cth> js is when it gets fun
[23:17:11] <Berlin36> naaaah, i don't really like web dev
[23:17:20] <cth> well, python then
[23:17:25] <cth> cpp is way to low-level
[23:17:29] <cth> not much shit is done with i
[23:17:31] <cth> it
[23:17:37] <Berlin36> yeah that's what seems cool to me
[23:17:41] <Berlin36> assembly and shit
[23:18:18] <Berlin36> well I've learned a bit of c++
[23:18:22] <Berlin36> now idk what should i do
[23:18:29] <cth> oh, the lower level
[23:18:44] <cth> join a cool cpp open source project
[23:18:48] <cth> I happen to know of one
[23:18:50] <cth> CDDA! :)
[23:19:00] <cth> what a great game
[23:19:07] <Berlin36> oh
[23:19:24] <cth> a bit retarded lead dev, but the game is cool and a lot of cool folks
[23:19:44] <Berlin36> i see
[23:19:59] <Berlin36> i learned a bit of OOP too
[23:20:42] <Berlin36> in c++ 
[23:21:00] <Urchin[emacs]> if you really want low level, use C!
[23:21:03] <cth> do you know other langs and have a formal coding education?
[23:21:15] <cth> no, don't use C. better go asm right away
[23:21:19] <cth> C is useless now
[23:21:32] <Berlin36> nah
[23:21:38] <cth> oh
[23:21:43] <Berlin36> im a teen that tries to self teach himself
[23:22:01] <Berlin36> because umm i can't get a proper coding education at the moment
[23:22:09] <cth> huh. without a formal/structured education it's gonna be tough
[23:22:12] <cth> an uphill battle
[23:22:20] <Berlin36> its okay
[23:22:26] <enyc> hrrm sounds about right
[23:22:31] <cth> so better do courses :) they will help avoiding losing time.
[23:22:44] <Berlin36> i did a 10 hour cpp course on utube
[23:23:01] <MootPoot> !later tell emmeka help , alberta is being cringe again
[23:23:03] <Berlin36> after that, idunno what to do lol, i guess learn more?
[23:23:17] <Berlin36> the fuck is alberta, MootPoot?
[23:23:20] <MootPoot> see pee pee on youtube
[23:23:31] <Berlin36> seepp
[23:23:31] <cth> well, there's more to coding really. there's async, functional code, multithreading, work with API, work with IO, databases, OS APIs, etc.
[23:23:32] <MootPoot> Berlin36: the fuck is germany Berlin36 
[23:23:38] <Berlin36> idunno mate
[23:23:40] <cth> years worth of knowledge
[23:23:47] <Berlin36> yeah cth
[23:23:56] <Berlin36> soooo
[23:24:05] <Berlin36> i don't know what to do really
[23:24:10] <cth> whatever's fun for you
[23:24:18] <cth> fun is the most important part
[23:24:37] <Berlin36> existensial crisis intensifies
[23:24:42] <cth> find a game you like, join the dev community, make mods, contribute. Learn git :)
[23:24:49] <Berlin36> i don't really play games
[23:25:02] <cth> oh, well, fapping works too
[23:25:05] <Berlin36> i might play a few mins a day, like terraria
[23:25:10] <Berlin36> lmao 
[23:25:15] <cth> make a porn novel. just find an artist :) use a framework
[23:25:23] <Berlin36> huh
[23:25:27] <Berlin36> sounds good
[23:25:41] <Berlin36> gonna draw sexy stick-women
[23:25:48] <cth> ahahahah
[23:25:53] <Berlin36> yeee
[23:25:57] <cth> using vector graphics to be able to zoom in indefinitely
[23:26:02] <Berlin36> lmao
[23:26:04] <cth> :)
[23:26:12] <Berlin36> i like malware
[23:26:21] <Berlin36> i mean
[23:26:31] <Berlin36> i don't really want to harm people with it
[23:26:37] <Berlin36> just seems fun
[23:26:45] <Berlin36> to know how to code it 
[23:26:58] <cth> disasming it is more fun. disasming and attacking the endpoints it's meant to use
[23:27:14] <cth> but attacking endpoints will require web-hack skills
[23:27:16] <cth> but it is fun
[23:27:31] <Berlin36> i once tried an assembly ctf!
[23:27:40] <Berlin36> it was like very easy, but i liked it
[23:27:42] <cth> oh, you can avoid hacking with web, actually. you can go the metasploit route.
[23:27:54] <Berlin36> is metasploit actually used?
[23:28:08] <cth> I don't know. I stopped doing this many years ago
[23:28:14] <Berlin36> i see
[23:28:19] <Berlin36> why
[23:28:22] <cth> burp is used
[23:28:29] <cth> cuz you don't make money being a hacker
[23:28:31] <cth> it's just fun
[23:28:34] <Berlin36> oh
[23:28:36] <cth> money, however, is fun too
[23:28:37] <cth> hehe
[23:28:45] <Berlin36> y- you don't?..
[23:28:52] <Berlin36> how is that possible
[23:28:59] <cth> I mean, you do... but not much
[23:29:12] <Berlin36> :sadface:
[23:29:26] <Berlin36> welp yeah, i guess hacking is more fun
[23:29:28] <cth> no no, if you're really good at it, then you will make a lot, I guess.
[23:29:31] <Berlin36> and also useful?
[23:30:04] <Berlin36> i also like cryptography
[23:30:11] <cth> hacking is useful in terms that you need to know A LOT to be successful. And that knowledge keeps giving in any other IT industry
[23:30:18] <Berlin36> yeaah
[23:30:38] <Berlin36> malware + cryptography = ransomware?? xd
[23:30:54] <cth> so it's a good thing to do when you're young. just don't be malicious. A lot of our folks got to jail cuz they were not careful enough. And it's VERY easy to leave more clues than you intend.
[23:31:06] <Berlin36> yeah i know 
[23:31:15] <Berlin36> i try not to do anything dangerous
[23:31:29] <Berlin36> only hack wifi acces points when i can lmao
[23:33:34] <cth> lulz. hack wifi, sniff the authentications, maybe implement a MIM with substituting the certificates. Get into their mail. Find resumes that they sent from their emails. Contact them. Have fun feeding them bits of their info back to them. Make them wonder. Have more fun. Then suggest improving their wifi encryption.
[23:33:57] <cth> social engineering is a lot of fun on web, too.
[23:33:59] <Berlin36> that seems a good idea except the last part
[23:34:10] <Berlin36> "Then suggest improving their wifi encryption"
[23:34:13] <Berlin36> nope.
[23:34:17] <Berlin36> not gonna do that

[23:34:42] <cth> when I did it, people thought I was from special forces
[23:34:55] <cth> I wouldn't always tell them the real deal either
[23:35:10] <Berlin36> i once *accidentally* entered in a network that had about 30 fucking cameras
[23:35:16] <cth> hehehe
[23:35:34] <Berlin36> i say accidentally because i didn't knew they had so many devices there

[23:37:14] <cth> it's definitely harder now than it used to be
[23:37:19] <Berlin36> yeah

[23:40:25] <Berlin36> lmfao
[23:40:30] <Berlin36> i see
[23:40:41] <cth> the problem is governmental honeypots
[23:40:44] <MootPoot> much bad advice here
[23:40:57] <Berlin36> true too i guess ^
[23:40:57] <cth> oh, yes, it's not a legal advice :)
[23:40:59] <MootPoot> just do white hat stuff / CTF etc
[23:41:08] <Berlin36> sounds boring
[23:41:18] <cth> they make it fun
[23:41:19] <MootPoot> the skills are the same
[23:41:25] <cth> they make hacking quests. I did a lot of those
[23:41:26] <cth> very cool
[23:41:28] <Berlin36> where can i do some ctf that can teach me useful things?
[23:41:30] <cth> not sure if they still do it
[23:41:35] <cth> I even made one with friends
[23:41:42] <cth> that involved metasploit, lol
[23:41:45] <cth> ahahaha
[23:41:52] <Berlin36> creating those quests seems harder cth
[23:41:55] <Berlin36> lol
[23:42:26] <Berlin36> i tried HackTheBox
[23:42:31] <Berlin36> inexplicable shit
[23:42:41] <Berlin36> i passed the tutorial i guess
[23:42:46] <Berlin36> but i understood nothing lmao
[23:42:57] <Berlin36> it was about 8 months ago

[23:43:10] <Berlin36> the title is interesting
[23:43:18] <cth> this is classic.
[23:43:35] <cth> I think it's about 20 years old. But it gets hard.
[23:43:42] <Berlin36> there is just a jpg image
[23:43:55] <cth> :)
[23:43:58] <Berlin36> if this involves looking at the source code of the page
[23:44:00] <cth> nooope :)
[23:44:05] <Berlin36> i can't from my phone
[23:44:19] <Berlin36> or if the jpg has some shit hidden in it
[23:44:27] <cth> ye, you need to use a pc, I guess.
[23:44:31] <Berlin36> yea
[23:44:42] <Berlin36> cth, have you heard about cicada3301?
[23:44:47] <cth> ye
[23:44:54] <Berlin36> what are your thoughts
[23:44:58] <cth> eeeh
[23:45:13] <cth> I think it was back when google believed in merit
[23:45:24] <cth> now they got retarded, cucked by social justice garbage
[23:45:29] <Berlin36> i spoke with some guys in a chat dedicated to it that claimed they finished the quest, they sounded like crazy fucking retards
[23:45:57] <Berlin36> it was obv related to gov hiding something and shit
[23:45:59] <Berlin36> yup.
[23:46:09] <cth> it was about corps recruting folks, I believe
[23:46:18] <cth> google, in partuicular
[23:46:23] <Berlin36> oh
[23:46:54] <cth> but then again, a good hacker spending their time on shit like that? Imagine an hour of your time is worth $200. And then you spend 40 hours on some random fucking rabbit hole.
[23:47:01] <cth> you must be a retard to do that
[23:47:06] <Berlin36> lmaooo
