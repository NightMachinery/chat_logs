[07:29:39] <epony> so cranking licenses in their strength lower in the platform is immediately a fork / replacement
[07:29:42] <tpefreedom> But gpl2 is still a fairly strong copyleft
[07:30:07] <epony> does not change correct assignments, even if there are cases that are incorrect
[07:30:44] <epony> going back is difficult after you strengthen the protections
[07:31:22] <epony> so great disasters happen when many years have been spend on many thousands of people on incorrect starting choices, these get torn / broken by wind of change
[07:31:31] <epony> "spenT"
[07:31:49] <tpefreedom> Copyleft ensures that an individual or small group can't betray the rest of the community. Permissive licenses make it legally very simple for proprietary software developers to take the work of other projects and communities without respect the rights of users.
[07:31:54] <epony> other than that, anyone do as they please ;-)
[07:32:32] <epony> I am not arguing about anything.. just informing what is the big picture.

[07:36:10] <epony> not related, but indicative: if a very powerful government with a very large army can not force one of their own domestic companies (not one) pay taxes and work in the interest of people, a software license is just.. words of hope

[07:37:22] <tpefreedom> Do people think that intel's dedicated GPUs will work well with free software?
[07:37:46] <epony> so think more about the relation to other software in the free world, rather than what ruthless business has always been and will continue doing
[07:40:37] <epony> Intel started opening up on CPU compilers and later GPU drivers early, but keep the commercially viable parts or externally sourced property (cores and software) closed.

[08:08:23] <epony> I'd recommend avoinding 4K if you want free software and reliable operation until LLVM drivers are really working well.
[08:09:11] <epony> with GPUs, the advantage is picking power efficient late models at the perfection of the chips cores and their packaging and software.
[08:10:32] <epony> if you aim for the best of the 10-20W cards, and if you can get that in half that power rating, you're looking at the good choices.

[09:27:44] <khronosschoty> Linux Kernel was never truly freedom centered, in the same way the fsf sees it
[09:28:14] <khronosschoty> Linus adopted gpl for pragmatic reasons really imo

[09:29:49] <AIM[m]> BSD is more permissive no?
[09:29:56] <AIM[m]> I like GPL-3 better
[09:29:59] <GoatAvenger> I think the community should focus on a multitude of linux replacement kernels
[09:29:59] <khronosschoty> but if your forking a project 
[09:30:05] <khronosschoty> you can fork to gpl3
[09:30:09] <AIM[m]> GPL-4 if it did exist!
[09:30:10] <khronosschoty> you can't do that with linux
[09:30:13] <GoatAvenger> the hurd should get finished, a bsd kernel woudl be neat, minix, too..

[10:10:52] <khronosschoty> your talking neo cons
[10:11:02] <GoatAvenger> kittyblam, I never said there weren't?
[10:11:17] <khronosschoty> there are no conservatives 
[10:11:18] <GoatAvenger> kittyblam, not sure what you are getting at
[10:11:29] <kittyblam> ah, when you said its a thing I thought you meant it was a universal thing, not a thing that in some situations arises
[10:11:38] <epony> right wing movements are capitalism, monarchism, feodalism, religious dogmatism, death by extinguished light
[10:11:39] <khronosschoty> the conservatives pretty much got wiped out after ww2
[10:11:51] <khronosschoty> not that America had any if your talking about America 
[10:11:53] <GoatAvenger> kittyblam, no, i'm coming at this conversatino from more of a etymological and linguistic perspective, than a political/economical one
[10:12:01] <epony> America has no political system.
[10:12:05] <khronosschoty> they lost theirs in the 1800's
[10:12:05] <epony> It's a monoparteid.
[10:12:07] <GoatAvenger> kittyblam, as far as i'm concerned we're all fucked, in the end
[10:12:27] <kittyblam> I don't get doomerism tbh, things are pretty hopeful in the long term imo
[10:12:46] <GoatAvenger> kittyblam, I wouldn't argue against that, I'm just taken to pessimism lately...
[10:12:49] <GoatAvenger> kittyblam, good to hear
[10:12:59] <epony> of course, there were smart people before and there are much more in the present
[10:13:15] <epony> because 1) there are more people 2) there is information and education

[10:13:42] <khronosschoty> so I would say BSD type lic actually is more Representative of conservative 
[10:13:42] <epony> both are exponential factors for intelligence and collaborative aggregate intellectual works
[10:13:52] <epony> you're wrong again
[10:14:03] <kittyblam> in the short term we are dealing with some massive problems due to centralization and mass surveliance used to weaponize information for corporations (which are virtually inherently right-wing groups)
[10:14:14] <epony> left wing on the table in the article is liberal and permissive and is in teh public interest
[10:14:30] <epony> kittyblam, that's a problem of capitalism and imperialism
[10:14:34] <kittyblam> ^
[10:14:36] <GoatAvenger> I would have to say, from my position, 'right wing,' 'licenses,' would ALL be proprietary, period
[10:14:36] <khronosschoty> liberal doesn't mean permissive exactly 
[10:14:42] <epony> which is serious dudu / bad juju
[10:14:43] <kittyblam> GoatAvenger: ^^^
[10:14:52] <khronosschoty> tho I can understand why people might take it that way
[10:15:04] <GoatAvenger> and that would also include the neo-liberals
[10:15:09] <epony> cause people collectively know more than 1 individual
[10:15:15] <GoatAvenger> such as the music industry, movie industry... they all want infinite copyright
[10:15:20] <GoatAvenger> so they can just let the money roll in
[10:15:22] <khronosschoty> there is just neo cons, liberals and neo-liberals
[10:15:23] <epony> and can educate each other and decide together
[10:15:29] <khronosschoty> no one represents the conservatives 
[10:15:37] <khronosschoty> they plain don't exist in any real way
[10:15:38] <kittyblam> personally I think licensing needs to be replaces with local laws restrictions on what is considered ethical, although for the time being reasonable copyleft licenses or more controversially for a room like this reasonable social domain licenses with good compatibility is the way to go
[10:15:43] <epony> there is really no significance, when it comes to software
[10:15:54] <khronosschoty> just why that stuff
[10:15:57] <epony> as the computers are in the hands of the large population
[10:15:58] <khronosschoty> gets stuck into software
[10:16:02] <khronosschoty> in the comments etc
[10:16:06] <khronosschoty> makes me sick when I See it
[10:16:09] <epony> which means that there is no class struggle when it comes to software
[10:16:10] <khronosschoty> people taking shots
[10:16:14] <khronosschoty> to push other agendas 
[10:16:18] <epony> it just does not exist in software ;-)
[10:16:29] <khronosschoty> I've seen enough of it
[10:16:31] <khronosschoty> to know better
[10:16:43] <epony> and regardless how many people scream "politics" about software, it's apolitical in nature as always
[10:16:44] <kittyblam> things like twitter actually benefit right wing groups, by the US definition of "left" vs right
[10:16:51] <epony> same as technology and education
[10:16:56] <kittyblam> epony: ^
[10:17:08] <khronosschoty> the "US" definition of left vs right
[10:17:11] <epony> correct, private companies presenting them as public services are right wing
[10:17:14] <khronosschoty> don't make me laugh 
[10:17:29] <khronosschoty> that definition was reversed 
[10:17:40] <khronosschoty> and completely hijacked by the republicans 
[10:17:42] <epony> right means "property" and "privatisation" and that about "everything"
[10:17:57] <epony> you know, rights -> owns things, and deprives others of it
[10:18:07] <khronosschoty> and the Democratic party was completely reconstructed from the ground up by the republicans 
[10:18:17] <khronosschoty> its the same party 
[10:18:26] <khronosschoty> so if you want to read their definition 
[10:18:37] <epony> so.. software given to people as "original do as you please" is disowning things and enabling others by sharing it with them
[10:18:38] <khronosschoty> and call it THE definition for the USA

[10:18:46] <khronosschoty> to software land
[10:18:47] <khronosschoty> XD
[10:18:53] <epony> same with technology, education and invetiontion (human knowledge)
[10:19:06] <epony> when it comes to software, there are no countries
[10:19:10] <epony> there are no barriers
[10:19:16] <epony> there is no ownage
[10:19:38] <khronosschoty> thats why I leave out that kind of terminology 
[10:19:43] <khronosschoty> when talking software 
[10:19:50] <epony> it's human common information and knowledge represented as "utilites" for distributed use
[10:19:54] <khronosschoty> I understand the copyleft hack tho
[10:19:55] <khronosschoty> it was fun
[10:20:03] <epony> it's not a hack
[10:20:08] <khronosschoty> it was a hack
[10:20:09] <epony> a hack is claiming there is copyright
[10:20:16] <khronosschoty> stallman hacked copyright 
[10:20:19] <epony> no, you're completely misinformed
[10:20:20] <khronosschoty> and called it copyleft
[10:20:21] <GoatAvenger> yeah, I always understood copyleft was considered a legal, 'hack,'
[10:20:24] <epony> software was ALWAYS free
[10:20:26] <GoatAvenger> I think stallman said that
[10:20:27] <epony> from the start
[10:20:37] <epony> as is handwriting
[10:20:41] <GoatAvenger> it undoes copyright with copyright
[10:20:55] <GoatAvenger> or rather, reverses it, perhaps, more accurately
[10:21:00] <epony> software is absolutely free as information you write with your own hand
[10:21:15] <khronosschoty> before the liberals created copyright 
[10:21:22] <epony> there are no liberals.
[10:21:24] <khronosschoty> and the funny thing is stallman gave a good speech on this one time
[10:21:26] <kittyblam> copyright shouldn't be recognised as existing unless its to protect people instead of corporations, corporations help set the law of copyright to protect themselves at the cost of the public and is inherently illegitimate.
[10:21:42] <GoatAvenger> khronosschoty, wasn't copyright put into place before the term 'liberal,' as it is understood today, had it's meaning?
[10:21:45] <epony> there are "people claiming some epithet on them" who want to have more property and possessions
[10:21:46] <GoatAvenger> copyright is pretty old
[10:21:49] <GoatAvenger> printing press days..
[10:21:58] <epony> it does not exist in the domain of software
[10:21:58] <khronosschoty> no GoatAvenger there was not
[10:22:14] <khronosschoty> copyright is new
[10:22:15] <epony> it exists in the domain of trade and economic exchange of printed publications
[10:22:21] <khronosschoty> much newer than the term liberal even
[10:22:21] <khronosschoty> lol
[10:22:41] <epony> there is no term liberal, I am telling you no such political system or movement exists, not a party
[10:22:47] <GoatAvenger> khronosschoty, you've read up on the history of copyright?
[10:22:53] <khronosschoty> yes GoatAvenger 
[10:22:59] <GoatAvenger> I read up on it in detail, years ago, but, don't remember much
[10:22:59] <epony> it's a "fashion" and "branding" of fractional deviations
[10:23:04] <epony> as in "nuances"
[10:23:06] <epony> or paint
[10:23:10] <epony> has no meaning
[10:23:15] <GoatAvenger> khronosschoty, what is the origin for the term, 'liberal'?
[10:23:15] <khronosschoty> in the past people didn't have copyright 
[10:23:32] <epony> people still have no copyright
[10:23:34] <khronosschoty> the origin of the term dunno probably some latin origin GoatAvenger 
[10:23:35] <epony> the publisher has it
[10:23:42] <epony> and he gets the cash
[10:23:46] <epony> people get scammed
[10:23:47] <GoatAvenger> khronosschoty, i mean in the political sense, as a defining term
[10:23:55] <GoatAvenger> guess i should look into it
[10:24:28] <khronosschoty> probably goes back to 17th century or 16th century Britain 
[10:24:36] <epony> yes, at least one of all people talking should know what is being said ;-) I think most of us here know it, but some people talk fashionable nonsense
[10:24:45] <khronosschoty> like John Locke 
[10:24:49] <khronosschoty> stuff like that
[10:24:53] <khronosschoty> they were Liberals 
[10:25:02] <epony> we're 2020-2030 decade
[10:25:17] <khronosschoty> when talking copyright 
[10:25:19] <GoatAvenger> at any rate, these words are so emotionally charged, and devoid of nearly any meaning anymore, it's pointless to use them in discussion for anything other than arguing about what could only be explained by history, semantics, etymology, etc..
[10:25:19] <epony> software exists with the digital computer stored programs
[10:25:22] <khronosschoty> were going back to that
[10:25:24] <epony> and was free
[10:25:27] <epony> still is free
[10:25:48] <epony> just businesses sell the service to make it published in some bundle which you can reject
[10:25:52] <khronosschoty> the point is
[10:26:01] <epony> you have no points ;-)
[10:26:03] <khronosschoty> the so called people pushing for progress 
[10:26:07] <khronosschoty> pushed the stupid copyright 
[10:26:10] <epony> since there is no "liberal" party
[10:26:14] <khronosschoty> but then got outright abused 
[10:26:24] <khronosschoty> but it was a failed experiment 
[10:26:30] <khronosschoty> no matter how you paint it

[10:26:57] <epony> and calling trade secrets right wing is exactly the precise way to name it
[10:27:01] <GoatAvenger> republicans used to be more like liberals, I think too, in american history, if I'm not incorrect
[10:27:11] <khronosschoty> trade secrets was right wing 
[10:27:13] <GoatAvenger> we are probably in the midst of a lot of position flipping right now, as well
[10:27:17] <khronosschoty> but you kept it a secret 
[10:27:27] <khronosschoty> the whole point of copyright is to open the secret up
[10:27:48] <epony> the US has a monoparty system of two fractions that argue, but only 1 course of history is happening that is capitalist and imperial by nature so is rightmost wing
[10:27:58] <khronosschoty> like I said epony 
[10:28:05] <khronosschoty> the republicans crushed everyone else
[10:28:14] <khronosschoty> totally rebuilt the Democrats 
[10:28:23] <khronosschoty> then re-wrote USA history 
[10:28:24] <epony> no, the point of copyright is to charge money for publishing low quality material in large amounts
[10:28:36] <epony> that is known as junk press
[10:28:41] <epony> for profit
[10:28:42] <khronosschoty> epony, thats the reason that it exists today
[10:28:48] <khronosschoty> but not the reason given for its creation 
[10:28:50] <khronosschoty> back when 
[10:28:55] <epony> or capitalism (low quality goods in large amounts with contrived qualities)
[10:29:08] <GoatAvenger> copyright was originally used to secure rights to printing presses, I thought..
[10:29:17] <khronosschoty> Capitalism is the very opposite of monarchism 
[10:29:18] <epony> for publishers
[10:29:25] <epony> to become businesses
[10:29:30] <khronosschoty> Capitalist reduces everyone down to money 
[10:29:31] <epony> instead of public domain services
[10:29:43] <epony> so copyright is at war with free information forever
[10:29:46] <khronosschoty> Monarchism can't exist that way
[10:29:57] <epony> it wants you to be in the dark ages and buy candles
[10:29:59] <khronosschoty> it totally undermines the principles of monarchy 
[10:30:10] <GoatAvenger> and democracy
[10:30:11] <epony> that is what copyright is -> rightmost wing greed and restrictions
[10:30:13] <GoatAvenger> as it turns out
[10:30:15] <GoatAvenger> heh
[10:30:23] <khronosschoty> right wing is monarchy 
[10:30:32] <epony> yes, copyright is the feodal system
[10:30:32] <GoatAvenger> a'right i can't follow either of you anymore
[10:30:38] <GoatAvenger> lol
[10:30:40] <khronosschoty> no copyright was born 
[10:30:47] <khronosschoty> out of the democracy's and republics 
[10:31:06] <epony> invented by feodals and monarchies
[10:31:14] <khronosschoty> no
[10:31:18] <epony> so they tax the consumption of information
[10:31:24] <khronosschoty> you obviously don't know your history 
[10:31:31] <epony> YES, copyrightwing fascism is cancelled
[10:31:32] <khronosschoty> every read for example the french revolution 
[10:31:41] <khronosschoty> they killed king
[10:32:00] <khronosschoty> those are the people who invented copyright 
[10:32:01] <khronosschoty> and such
[10:32:19] <epony> your history is not history, but 250 years of imperialism and colonialism with de-facto monarchic oligarchy
[10:32:20] <khronosschoty> the king didn't even need to be killed the irony 
[10:32:32] <epony> so you can't lecture others ;-)
[10:32:37] <khronosschoty> the bloodshed of the french revolution 
[10:32:44] <khronosschoty> actually was shed after the king was killed
[10:32:53] <khronosschoty> and mostly because anarchy took place
[10:33:02] <khronosschoty> once the people realized they had been lied too
[10:33:10] <khronosschoty> and the king didn't do anything deserving of death 
[10:33:36] <epony> France is a monarchy to this day by international position and internal control, so the revolution was reverted to a capitalist state of private everything.
[10:33:44] <epony> so the blood was spilled in vain.
[10:34:01] <khronosschoty> Capitalism was what destroyed the French Monarchy silly
[10:34:16] <khronosschoty> and the Capitalists wanted to further their control
[10:34:22] <khronosschoty> so they offed the monarchs head
[10:34:51] <khronosschoty> the people were just played like puppets
[10:34:51] <epony> no, and you can compare it with other Western European imperial monarchies that are still operating as monarchies and not democracies.
[10:35:12] <khronosschoty> Democracy is something the current ruling elite push
[10:35:15] <epony> a system of a government is a monarchy, you know this too.

[10:46:00] <khronosschoty> to the charges
[10:46:10] <epony> so do governments of de-facto imperial systems that LIE that they are "the-mocracy"

[10:47:19] <epony> it's entertainment
[10:47:21] <khronosschoty> he had just sided with the people against the corporation in a number of instances saying the people rights were greater than the corporation

[10:48:56] <khronosschoty> LOL
[10:49:11] <epony> US history is only 250 years of colonial imperial and industrial capitalism
[10:49:26] <khronosschoty> its not only that
[10:49:29] <khronosschoty> you think its only that
[10:49:33] <khronosschoty> because those are the ones who one
[10:49:44] <khronosschoty> but at the very early stages there was an actual dream
[10:49:44] <epony> the world history is 50-2500 thousands years old when it comes to humans
[10:49:47] <khronosschoty> that spread
[10:49:59] <khronosschoty> spread so far that the victors couldn't totally kill the idea
[10:50:03] <khronosschoty> so they had to embrace it in name
[10:50:15] <khronosschoty> distort it 
[10:50:17] <khronosschoty> etc
[10:50:32] <epony> did you read the article about software licenses?
[10:50:38] <epony> it has a table at the top
[10:51:00] <epony> the thing on the left are public interest, the thing on the right is private interest
[10:51:25] <epony> here it is again  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_license
[10:51:33] <khronosschoty> alright well I said mu piece 
[10:51:39] <epony> left of the permissive license is public interest
[10:51:42] <khronosschoty> if your going to go on and abuse things

[10:51:53] <epony> this is not political
[10:52:04] <khronosschoty> but I said something
[10:52:41] <epony> it's about left and right on the table, that coincide with government and regulatory models of modern states and countries (and continents)
[10:53:07] <GoatAvenger> epony, what is your point even?
[10:53:07] <epony> when it comes to information and software
[10:53:20] <epony> the point was this:
[10:53:22] <GoatAvenger> epony, in summary?
[10:53:26] <epony> yes
[10:53:29] <epony> it was this:
[10:53:44] <epony> time progresses, software becomes more common, it moves to more permissive models
[10:54:10] <epony> so is an absolute process that is irreversible
[10:54:30] <epony> as is invention and achievement of technological progress for the entire humanity
[10:54:39] <epony> questions?

[10:56:45] <khronosschoty> well probably. but its this more historical perspective that caught my attention from the start. Starting when I first read what Stallman said about the origins of copyright 
[10:57:04] <khronosschoty> I have a lot of overlapping interests
[10:57:06] <khronosschoty> too
[10:57:12] <khronosschoty> so it all just ties together

[10:58:02] <khronosschoty> my aunt was a copyright and patent attorney for nintendo when I was 9 - whenever I don't know
[10:58:12] <khronosschoty> she was even on the box of a gameboy 
[10:58:19] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_materials_technology#2nd_millennium
[10:58:22] <khronosschoty> so I had an interest copyright law
[10:58:24] <GoatAvenger> the detailed history of copyright is interesting, yeah
[10:58:30] <khronosschoty> and patent law all on its own
[10:58:39] <epony> not really, it's an anachronism
[10:58:40] <khronosschoty> then I got interested in coding around 12
[10:59:03] <khronosschoty> but when I first started reading books I was reading 17th century english 
[10:59:24] <epony> as are legacy methods of operating materials and resources
[11:00:05] <epony> if you stay in the past, you have lower chance of competing in the modern society and industrial production
[11:00:26] <khronosschoty> what does knowing things have to do with staying in the past
[11:00:37] <khronosschoty> the past doesn't change because the future becomes ignorant of it
[11:00:43] <epony> it's the choice of usage
[11:00:54] <GoatAvenger> knowing history, I think, is infinitely valuable to the matters of the present
[11:01:04] <khronosschoty> agreed GoatAvenger 
[11:01:13] <epony> if you're into debates about the past
[11:01:26] <khronosschoty> if thats all you got out of it
[11:01:29] <khronosschoty> then I'm sorry
[11:01:42] <epony> that's what was being thrown out of the closet
[11:01:56] <khronosschoty> not from my point of view
[11:02:08] <khronosschoty> but I don't know how to proceed anymore 
[11:02:08] <GoatAvenger> tyranny tends to abhor the past, as it interferes with their ability to dominate the future and the present
[11:02:14] <khronosschoty> beyond saying I tried to say something
[11:02:18] <GoatAvenger> I put forward, that, anyway
[11:02:30] <khronosschoty> if an idea comes up where I think I can add value I'll do so
[11:02:40] <khronosschoty> agreed GoatAvenger 
[11:02:46] <epony> the present is where you are now, you have to know about the future too
[11:02:49] <khronosschoty> thats what I was trying to say
[11:03:05] <khronosschoty> the present is made up of the past
[11:03:11] <khronosschoty> with the past there is no present 
[11:03:19] <khronosschoty> without*
[11:03:21] <epony> explaining the little you know about the past makes you just affectionate with that explanation as you invest your efforts into that mostly
[11:03:40] <khronosschoty> not exactly 
[11:03:56] <GoatAvenger> on a more metaphysical level, one could say, history is ever changing, and maleable, due to our limitations in truly 'knowing,' it, but, that's more a philosophical thing..
[11:04:05] <epony> the more you repeat something the more time you have spent saying it
[11:04:29] <GoatAvenger> epony, in order for us to carry on this conversation, the history of it, is what gives us context
[11:04:32] <khronosschoty> like the many times I've used ls
[11:04:36] <khronosschoty> to see my files
[11:04:42] <GoatAvenger> epony, without that, it's just words with no context
[11:05:09] <epony> historic studies are pointless in solving problems of the present, they are useful in explaining problems of the past and not creating these problems in the present
[11:05:20] <khronosschoty> XD

[11:19:43] <epony> that's why MIT is gaining and GPL is losing "acceptance"
[11:20:02] <epony> cause the time of the protective licenses is expiring
[11:20:31] <epony> as were previously other more right-standing of it licenses getting into disuses
[11:20:57] <epony> more computers, more authors, more software available, less need for it to be protected and used for profit and commerce
[11:21:32] <epony> so, companies move to services instead of "distributing" software
[11:21:47] <epony> because they have less relevance and competing points
[11:21:53] <epony> get it?
[11:23:59] <epony> democratic definitions:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_copyright#East_Germany "A 1979 East German court ruling found that software was "neither a scientific work nor a creative achievement" and ineligible for copyright protection, legalizing software copying in the country.[3]"
[11:29:55] <GoatAvenger> epony, that factology wikipedia link has zero credible citations
[11:30:01] <GoatAvenger> hehe
[11:30:15] <GoatAvenger> zero citations, period.
[11:30:50] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_software#Free_and_open-source_software_as_successor
[11:30:57] <epony> read this ^
[11:31:28] <epony> the GPL was a later creation that is on the right of permissive software
[11:31:43] <GoatAvenger> the citation for the east germany ruling is behind a paywall
[11:32:02] <GoatAvenger> oh nm, perhaps not
[11:32:43] <epony> the point is: countries that were not FOR PROFIT capitalist proprietary and commercial everything, did have no enforcement of copyright and rejected it
[11:32:57] <epony> in fact they did NOT care
[11:33:34] <epony> people were copying diskettes and previously tapes and listings and written code as easy as publishing it in national and international magazines
[11:34:15] <epony> so the idea of making money on software was simply not useful to such countries
[11:34:28] <epony> the same applies to the developing world countries
[11:34:41] <kittyblam> The GPL would be amazing if it had some basic social domain protections, and more effort was spent in making the protections enforced. Feels like the protections are conveniantly ignored half the time when it benefits large companies, things like certain devs deciding to hardly enforce their GPL while conveniantly getting funding from big tech corporations lmao
[11:34:57] <epony> the US system of publishing is just a US thing, was not in Europe
[11:35:08] <kittyblam> no copyright is still much better than copyright tho, I would be fine with copyright if it only applied to mutually compatible free-alike licenses tbh
[11:35:20] <kittyblam> and the protections where only for protecting the public, rather than corporations and other middlemen
[11:35:23] <epony> hence this software licensing is totally not recognised outside USA
[11:35:50] <epony> and the internet demonstrates
[11:35:56] <epony> that every file flies freely
[11:36:04] <GoatAvenger> epony, copyright has it's origins in Europe, I believe, with the printing press
[11:36:23] <epony> you mean in selling presses and copies of books
[11:36:46] <GoatAvenger> epony, and if you skim the citation to your east germany claim, you'll see the Stasi was spying on computer clubs because they were concerned about 'subversive,' software that spoke out agains the state
[11:36:51] <epony> but here, governments owned the presses and the books were nominal cost for the paper only
[11:36:59] <epony> so.. the copyright is "fuckoff"
[11:37:03] <vitali64> epony
[11:37:03] <GoatAvenger> epony, printing presses; ie: publishers?  is what I mean

[11:38:28] <epony> despite being all a variant of capitalismm
[11:38:42] <epony> not everything is USA and US copyright law
[11:38:45] <GoatAvenger> my understanding is people use so called, 'lax-permissive,' licenses more and more, because people don't care as much about free software; these people consider the FSF and Stallman to be, 'extremists,' they are indifferent
[11:39:00] <epony> no
[11:39:03] <epony> on the opposite
[11:39:15] <epony> people care MUCH MORE now about free software

[11:39:24] <epony> and can not continue to use enforcing models
[11:39:32] <epony> since software is abundant
[11:39:59] <epony> and new software is more permissive and more open and accessible to the direction of government supported public domain
[11:40:18] <epony> Stallman is not an extremist.
[11:40:56] <epony> Xtremism is: piracy and theft cloning of commercial expensive software..
[11:41:03] <GoatAvenger> extremist is a loaded politicans word
[11:41:14] <epony> yeah you understand what I mean
[11:41:19] <GoatAvenger> just means, ' such and such person is crazy,'
[11:41:28] <epony> the contra of the oppressive systems
[11:41:31] <GoatAvenger> it's a 'write-off,' word
[11:41:46] <epony> US copyright for software is oppressive
[11:41:51] <GoatAvenger> I'm not convinced people give a crap about free software though, more and more, as you say
[11:41:59] <epony> they give a lot of care
[11:42:04] <epony> especially in Europe
[11:42:19] <GoatAvenger> Hmm
[11:42:21] <epony> and will sanction and evict all foreign proprietary software given a chance
[11:42:43] <GoatAvenger> I haven't heard of many european countires using free software over proprietary
[11:42:46] <epony> just the monarcho-capitalist governments prevent this
[11:42:55] <GoatAvenger> except for germany, which tried once, then went back to microsoft, then i think now is trying again
[11:42:58] <epony> while a real government is in teh interest of the people
[11:43:04] <GoatAvenger> maybe some south american countries
[11:43:07] <GoatAvenger> to a small degree
[11:43:13] <epony> and would steer publishing to be nearly free for all its citizens
[11:43:36] <GoatAvenger> I don't know of any monarcho-capitalist countries..
[11:43:44] <epony> actually 90% of people are using free software (individuals)
[11:44:05] <epony> either free open software, or pirated
[11:44:32] <GoatAvenger> epony, could you name a monarcho-capitalist country for me?
[11:44:41] <epony> the IMFC (imperial monarcho-fascist capitalism) is the Western European and colonial dominion states and countries
[11:44:46] <epony> I just did
[11:45:05] <GoatAvenger> there are monarchies in europe?
[11:45:09] <epony> yes
[11:45:14] <GoatAvenger> which countries
[11:45:17] <epony> de-facto and signatory
[11:45:37] <epony> (ceremonial monarchies and real monarchies exist)
[11:45:53] <epony> and the western model of governments are de-facto monarchies
[11:45:53] <GoatAvenger> name one country with a king and queen that has no republic democracy?
[11:46:16] <GoatAvenger> monarch: rule by one
[11:46:17] <epony> no country in the world has democracy currently
[11:46:30] <epony> all countries have temporary monarchs, some for life
[11:46:47] <GoatAvenger> name a country ruled by a monarch then
[11:47:06] <epony> is this Tic-Tac-Toe for 4th grade kids ;-)
[11:47:16] <GoatAvenger> no it's a question
[11:47:18] <GoatAvenger> Bhutan, for example
[11:47:21] <epony> cause it was obsolete in 1st grade
[11:47:21] <GoatAvenger> has a monarch
[11:47:35] <epony> what do you think is a Kanzler?
[11:47:42] <epony> Chancellor
[11:47:45] <GoatAvenger> you make statements, don't back them up with evidence then resort to name calling; that doesn't make you informed
[11:48:01] <epony> or what do you think is an irreplaceable president?
[11:48:38] <epony> reality is hard to misrepresent with "pretense" wording in paperwork and false claims
[11:49:01] <GoatAvenger> name a country with an absolute monarch
[11:49:04] <epony> so for example, US calls itself a democracy but it's not.
[11:49:24] <GoatAvenger> I can't dialogue or debate with you, if you refuse to enter into discourse
[11:49:29] <GoatAvenger> you are just talking outloud
[11:49:35] <epony> Turkey is a country with an absolute monarch under the disguise of a president.
[11:49:55] <GoatAvenger> ok, saudia arabia seems to have an absolute monarch as well
[11:50:04] <epony> yes.. go on listing things..
[11:50:05] <GoatAvenger> do these countries have capitlism?
[11:50:18] <epony> some variant of it
[11:50:27] <GoatAvenger> so they could be said to be, 'monarcho-capitalist'?
[11:50:42] <GoatAvenger> as in they are ruled by a monarch and engage in some degree of free trade?
[11:50:57] <epony> by definition, coutnries which are not "peoples' republic" are IMFC
[11:51:16] <epony> and they have long running leaders too
[11:51:36] <epony> so are de-facto monarchies but in the interest of the people
[11:51:57] <GoatAvenger> so saudi arabia is a 'monarcho-capitalist,' society, or not?
[11:52:03] <epony> while in the western capitalism it is in the interest of the oligarchy and military-industrial and other complexes
[11:52:06] <GoatAvenger> by your understanding
[11:52:15] <epony> it's a legacy imperial system
[11:52:21] <GoatAvenger> you aren't answering my questions
[11:52:24] <epony> of feodal clans
[11:52:24] <GoatAvenger> just talking out loud more
[11:52:39] <epony> your questions are repetitive and not very meaningful
[11:52:44] <epony> you answer them yourself
[11:52:52] <GoatAvenger> I'm asking you
[11:53:04] <GoatAvenger> it's called social discourse
[11:53:05] <epony> you're not getting answers for a reason
[11:53:11] <GoatAvenger> what is that reason?
[11:53:12] <epony> the questions are not "useful"
[11:53:19] <GoatAvenger> what is useful, by your definition?
[11:53:27] <GoatAvenger> useful is subjective
[11:53:45] <epony> repetitive, pointless and not really questions but time loss
[11:53:54] <epony> you just say what you think
[11:54:00] <GoatAvenger> why are they a time loss to you?
[11:54:13] <GoatAvenger> what makes them pointless?
[11:54:15] *** Quits: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:54:16] <epony> did I not repeat why about 5 times?
[11:54:30] <GoatAvenger> I don't know, I'm waiting for an answer to my first question, which you did not answer.
[11:54:53] <GoatAvenger> I can't engange in conversation with some one who refuses to do so.
[11:55:04] <epony> you are not getting answers if you ask the same question that was pointless the first time ;-)
[11:55:14] <epony> ask smart questions
[11:55:19] <GoatAvenger> Pointless is subjective, not absolute.
[11:55:24] <epony> you're not even participating
[11:55:27] <GoatAvenger> smart questions are also subjective, not absolute.
[11:55:43] <GoatAvenger> I am participating, you are shutting me down with subjective appraisals of the contents of my inquiries.
[11:55:48] <epony> you're just.. trying to be inquisite and not trying very hard at it
[11:55:52] <GoatAvenger> rather than enganging in discourse.
[11:56:04] <epony> yes, the questions suck ;-)
[11:56:10] <epony> improve a bit on this skill
[11:56:15] <GoatAvenger> That is another subjective appraisal.
[11:56:27] <GoatAvenger> You still refuse to engage in discourse, and defer to personal attacks.
[11:56:34] <GoatAvenger> That's not conversation.
[11:56:37] <GoatAvenger> or discrouse
[11:56:41] <GoatAvenger> or dialogue
[11:56:43] <epony> no I am not attacking you, just the questions
[11:56:43] <GoatAvenger> or debate
[11:56:57] <GoatAvenger> The questions were asked by me.
[11:56:58] <epony> you are somewhere on the anon-space of the interchat
[11:57:13] <GoatAvenger> What is anon-space?
[11:57:15] <epony> well, I have the choice to pick which questions I answer.
[11:57:21] <epony> don't be a fascist
[11:57:22] <GoatAvenger> That you do.
[11:57:39] <epony> that is an epithet
[11:57:43] <GoatAvenger> What evidence do you bring forward to claim that I am fascist?
[11:57:53] <epony> see I answer before you ask
[11:57:58] <epony> if the question is relevant
[11:58:29] <epony> commanding the other person to answer rapid question is too much demand to ask
[11:58:41] <epony> so exaggerated comment is issued to indicate it
[11:59:09] <epony> we. can. talk. with. under. standing.
[11:59:35] <GoatAvenger> Right, we can.
[11:59:36] <epony> refusal to, and asking asking is.. not helping it
[11:59:41] <GoatAvenger> We can also be respectful.
[11:59:45] <GoatAvenger> And we can back up our claims with evidence
[11:59:50] <GoatAvenger> Which you offer none.
[11:59:58] <GoatAvenger> You said I was being fascist.
[12:00:00] <GoatAvenger> How so?
[12:00:06] <epony> like articles from Wikipedia are invisible?
[12:00:23] <GoatAvenger> I can see articles from wikipedia fine; but, right now, I'm talking with you, or trying to.
[12:00:28] <GoatAvenger> How does that relate to calling me a fascist?
[12:00:38] <GoatAvenger> How does that question relate to your claim of my fascism?
[12:00:40] <epony> maybe, because you were too inquisitive and asking too much without not reading any of the links
[12:00:49] <GoatAvenger> Which links did I not read?
[12:00:57] <epony> which one did you read?
[12:00:58] <epony> ;-)
[12:01:05] <GoatAvenger> You made the claim, not me.
[12:01:10] <GoatAvenger> So you must know, right?
[12:01:12] <epony> and I put a link
[12:02:00] <epony> then I called Western "democracies" untrue and accused them of monarcho-imperialist setup.
[12:02:14] <epony> what's unclear about it?
[12:02:16] <GoatAvenger> I think you said, 'monarcho-capitalist'
[12:02:23] <GoatAvenger> no?
[12:02:25] <epony> IMFC to be precise
[12:03:46] <epony> imperial cause they invade other countries, monarcho because they are single point of control the entire empire, fascist because they are into fashion and disposable goods of luxury and excess at the backs of other countries, and capitalism because they steal resources and labour and minerals and produce from others unfairly through war and military threats and invasion

[12:06:05] <gothicserpent> He was banned from a ton of channels
[12:06:17] <gothicserpent> For trolling
[12:06:22] <epony> mostly channels of Frank Gingras.
[12:06:28] <epony> who are like 3 channes of 20 people
[12:06:39] <epony> because he was doing spam elsewhere
[12:06:44] <epony> and I told him not to spam
[12:07:02] <epony> and he thinks that is a reason to ban people from his 3 chans which he holds without right
[12:07:25] <epony> cause he is neither the owner of the apache web server community, nor that of the mysql project, nor of the postfix project.

[12:45:44] <epony> you can write to the inquisition too
[12:49:47] <epony> like, think about it: what options do you have to enforce your copyright policy on 100 people, now make that 100 million globally?
[12:51:49] <epony> you can't, so why pretend that it exists, while it really just affects software publishers leading their protective battles against each other, for reasons entirely not technical or political, just for their business and non and for profit needs
[12:52:14] <gothicserpent> bandali: epony is engaging in destructive behavior that is not productive for the community. After clearing my backlog after he did this before, he did it again and engaged in a long monologue unrelated to the free software foundation. Our IRC community is delicate enough as it is, and when people spam like this it just ruins it for everyone.
[12:52:20] <vivien> epony, the problem with your posting walls of text is that nobody knows what you are talking about. There are other problems too, but this one should concern you most.
[12:53:26] <epony> gothicserpent, that is incorrect
[12:53:38] <epony> vivien, of course, nobody is forced to read
[12:56:03] <vivien> People do want to catch up in general, in case someone asked a meaningful question before you started your monologue.
[12:56:15] <epony> your community is safe and sound, and a couple of lines of text do not cause problems
[13:01:35] <epony> I replied to a couple of points, and two-three persons objected and took it to political cause that is all they wanted.. don't blame someone for that

[13:05:16] <kittyblam> iirc the official statements of the FSF is that copyright shouldn't exist in the context of software, *and* that things like the GPL should be used while it exists as protection or something
[13:06:21] <epony> and someone objecting to the copyring is not against FSF

[13:09:56] <kittyblam> I don't know what your trying to say tbh.
[13:10:19] <epony> that the real problem is created by private businesses and that non-profit is private business too
[13:10:39] <epony> and that it should be government supported rather than private businesses controlled
[13:10:44] <kittyblam> yeah
[13:10:55] <kittyblam> that *what* in particular btw?
[13:11:31] <epony> well, I like to see that taken out of the US model of doing licensing and copyright law
[13:12:26] <epony> if someone explains why a license is needed outside of commerce, then we can see things
[13:12:32] <kittyblam> if your referring to the FSF, tbh my biggest complaint is their skewed definition of freedom which doesn't include several free licenses and includes things which are hardly seen as free by any repositories
[13:13:13] <kittyblam> but yeah "intellectual property" I do agree shouldnt be a private thing like that, and should instead be community/government protection from being exploited by other nations that would have copyright laws etc.
[13:13:46] <kittyblam> for example, for international law I wonder if a government could have it set up where

[13:14:46] <epony> I have none objections to the FSF and its work.. or the community, I think the copyright law is a disaster for software and it propagates by not having an alternative to copyright.
[13:15:05] <kittyblam> you can choose any license that meets certain criteria and is mutually compatible, and you and your local area both "own" it 50/50 in the eyes of international law, whereas in internal law its kinda just whatever goes with normal citizen protection laws being the main thing that applies
[13:15:46] <kittyblam> copyright law is a disaster yeah, it needs to be totally destroyed as we know it now, and instead something designed to protect people rather than corporate interest in its place
[13:15:54] *** Joins: chuangzhu (~chuangzhu@user/chuangzhu)
[13:17:43] <kittyblam> the 50/50 ownership in the eyes of copyright regions (if they choose to even recognise it or are strongarmed into recognising it) would hopefully allow for *either* the government or the individual to sue anyone outside the government breaking the basic protection laws in it

[13:21:19] <gothicserpent>  <epony>explaining the little you know about the past makes you just affectionate with that explanation as you invest your efforts into that mostly
[13:21:58] <epony> it is because the focus was put on historic things about revolutions and decapitations that were disgusting
[13:22:26] <epony> and the neo-liberal speech that is on the right wing is nasty too

[13:30:05] <kittyblam> epony: I would be less of a dick tbh, give them time to find evidence of such a claim whether or not its true or a lie
[13:31:00] <epony> there is no evidence
[13:31:04] <kittyblam> if its a false claim, I don't quite blame you for being rash on your comments given the severity of the claim

[13:31:33] <epony> gothicserpent, don't talk ever to me again.

[13:31:45] <gothicserpent> 02:35:51	<epony>	under how many nick names and fake channel control is this Frank Gingras Canadian of Greek origin and why is he such a loser to ban people on IRC instead of watching his databases and personal life?
[13:31:58] <epony> that is not racist!

[13:32:27] <epony> damn, you're inventing things
[13:32:44] <epony> that is not the guix mod
[13:32:55] <kittyblam> If that statement was true (Where do I sift through the logs) , context is very important in that statement
[13:32:55] <epony> the #guix mod is $a:nckx
[13:33:10] <kittyblam> I've said my fair share of things that are totally fine in context but out of context would sound ten times worse than that

[13:34:09] <kittyblam> what was the context of "Canadian of Greek origin"?
[13:34:28] <gothicserpent> kittyblam: he said this in #fsf on Dec 22.
[13:34:47] <epony> yes, $a:thumbs is a troll and bans for no reason

[13:35:27] <gothicserpent> #guix , #libera, and other channels have banned him for doing this.
[13:35:34] <epony> incorrect
[13:35:38] <kittyblam> uhh where do I get the fsf logs again? lmao
[13:35:47] <gothicserpent> He then called out a #guix mod (don't want to give names) and spoke slurs against him.
[13:36:17] <epony> #libera applied a temp mute because they did not want to admit that $a:thumbs is a spammer in other networks and behave aggressively with moderation on libera.chat and that they support that

[13:38:46] <epony> gothicserpent, obviously you want suppressed talk when suppression is happening in chans on this "liberal" network that is neither liberal nor permissive
[13:38:52] <gnoo> > gothicserpent | I find it racist and immoral and not welcome. 
[13:38:54] <gnoo> nothing i can see in my logs suggests epony as racist or immoral. he talks alot so maybe people find him as trolling but not the other way
[13:39:03] <gothicserpent> he also called the same mod in question a, "coward" and a "fascist" (a political term completely unrelated to free software or GNU).
[13:39:06] <kittyblam> I am too tired to deal with finding the logs, and since it wasn't provided I'm just going to assume epony was being an ass as seems normal for them, but not necessarily to a level, I, as a random lurker, would view as banworthy tbh
[13:39:31] <epony> it's not even wrong ;-)
[13:39:52] <gothicserpent> kittyblam: the logs were a bit tricky for me to find too. when he called me out i said, "Okay, time to handle this.." lol..
[13:39:52] <epony> I am here and giving my explanation.
[13:39:57] <kittyblam> gothicserpent: some parts of free software has a facist problem that isn't really being admitted
[13:39:58] <gothicserpent> glad i still have them.
[13:40:10] <kittyblam> frick didnt mean to mention aa
[13:40:12] <epony> if you did not, I have them, so be cool.
[13:40:30] <vivien> Doxing, and repeating patterns of insults and walls of texts should be enough I think
[13:40:38] <bung6[m]> <bung6[m]> "Would you help me after 10 days" <- now ı am not available
[13:40:38] <epony> it's public info
[13:40:46] <bung6[m]> for configuration
[13:40:49] <epony> in IRC whois
[13:40:52] <kittyblam> so calling someone a facist really again depends on context, as there is plenty of examples of facists in places like this.
[13:40:54] <gothicserpent> doxing in any form, yes.

[13:41:35] <kittyblam> vivien: where can I find evidence of doxxing? that is quite a bit above the severity of the other claims
[13:41:36] <epony> these people are using their names in their IRC details and when talking with people from the position of 'authority' and their roles
[13:41:50] <gothicserpent> 00:56:53	<rindolf>	epony: your monologue is annoying
[13:41:55] <gothicserpent> other people called him out on this before
[13:41:56] <epony> gothicserpent, you have nothing ;-)
[13:42:03] <gothicserpent> they told him to stop
[13:42:09] <gothicserpent> he did not
[13:42:12] <epony> you can repeat that forever ;-)
[13:42:20] <epony> you don't stop either
[13:42:50] <epony> anything else, like slap your last traffic fine on my nick name?
[13:42:58] <kittyblam> if they where engagging in doxxing then I could see why there would be a ban, but so far I see stubborn but not malicious behaviour
[13:43:15] <epony> I explained, quit being moral judges.
[13:43:47] <ffguest> Epony, please suggest me notebook for max price 189$
[13:43:50] <epony> ban whoever you like for whatever reasons you invent, that does not change facts.
[13:44:03] <epony> ffguest, what OS you want?
[13:44:05] <kittyblam> as a random lurker, I would seriously highly reccomend you be a bit less of an ass, while the claims are severe, again, silence can be a better tool against claims if used correctly

[13:45:27] <ffguest> Thanks.
[13:45:35] <epony> I would get something from 2012-2016 ;-)
[13:45:46] <gnoo> ffguest: there's some info in this link: https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw
[13:45:51] <epony> in the office entry series, not "ultrabooks"
[13:46:11] <epony> also, make sure they are Intel and/or Amd Radeon graphics (discrete)
[13:46:19] <epony> nvidia is avoided
[13:46:27] <ffguest> Nvidia sucks.
[13:46:46] <epony> I use an Asus netbook from 2010
[13:47:00] <ffguest> Macbook is bad or no?
[13:47:13] <epony> no idea, I do not touch Apple since 1984
[13:47:23] <ffguest> Oh, ok.
[13:48:00] <ffguest> Gnoo, thanks for link.
[13:48:01] <epony> had a couple of Apple ][ and ][e and ][+ machines 1982-1986
[13:48:16] <epony> they were relatively open architecture
[13:48:29] <epony> after that IBM PCs.. no Apples
[13:48:44] <epony> and freedom in the 1990ies with assemble it yourself
[13:49:00] <epony> so I don't even like laptops ;-)
[13:49:17] <ffguest> I use pc
[13:49:41] <ffguest> But this is not my pc.
[13:49:57] <ffguest> And, this pc have very bad video card (nvidia).
[13:50:04] <epony> PCs are super, especially if you assemble it yourself, and for laptops I like the HP probooks because they are much more open and free than IBM/Lenovo
[13:50:13] <vivien> kittyblam, last time epony was doxing the guix moderator, the term "doxxing" was written but I don’t have the logs anymore
[13:50:20] <epony> but if you want "coreboot" then that's Lenovo / IBM
[13:50:45] <ffguest> Non-free bios is bad?
[13:50:51] <epony> vivien, I do not dox people, I use what they tell me or what is public information in their IRC identification
[13:51:20] <epony> ffguest, I use stock BIOSes cause it is a Free machine with no proprietary inserts
[13:51:41] <epony> IBM/Lenovo are VERY proprietary and full of 10s of blobs in firmware
[13:51:52] <epony> on the hardware
[13:52:07] <epony> so you have 0 freedoms there even if you reflash with coreboot or libreboot
[13:52:32] <gothicserpent> here are my logs of what epony said to people: https://pastebin.com/DbViPQk9
[13:52:37] <epony> the general misconception that IBM/Lenovo provide the laptop to get you free is a blatant lie.
[13:52:37] <gothicserpent> you are all free to read it.
[13:52:46] <ffguest> Maybe i can install libreboot on macbook.
[13:52:59] <gnoo> gothicserpent: Error, this is a private paste or is pending moderation
[13:53:02] <epony> gothicserpent, people have logs from irc, not your own selective pastes
[13:53:11] <gothicserpent> ah, one sec
[13:53:13] <gothicserpent> thanks for telling me
[13:53:45] <epony> gothicserpent, I do not plan to read any of your claims any more, and opening links from IRC to private resources can reveal your IP and more
[13:53:49] <natewrench123456> epony, we really cant create our own hardware like software
[13:53:58] <gnoo> vivien: i couldn't find "doxxing" in both #fsf or #guix. there's one on guix: * nckx [20:25:30] went the opposite path or radical self-doxxing.
[13:53:59] <epony> natewrench123456, true
[13:54:21] <epony> but Lenovo is infected with implants and malware you call firmware
[13:54:43] <ffguest> I understand, thank you.
[13:54:44] <vivien> Oops, sorry, it was in #gnu
[13:54:49] <epony> gnoo, I have not written anything in #guix

[13:55:43] <natewrench123456> epony, maybe intel too with their ME, but until end users can build a CPU from scratch all we can do is use freedom software

[13:59:55] <gothicserpent> not at all, he was trying to stop you
[14:00:03] <gothicserpent> in fact, epony he made a bid in #libera to have you g-lined.
[14:00:13] <epony> that ban because they trolled elsewhere and were told not to spam and troll there, so they trolled and banned here
[14:00:13] <gothicserpent> a brief request.

[14:08:50] <epony> it is ephemeral ;-)

[14:09:52] <gnoo> i only follow two well moderated mailing lists so i don't know what happens there
[14:09:52] <juri_> treating everything as ephemeral is good for letting spam become the signal.

[14:10:48] <epony> just user generated text
[14:11:32] <gnoo> well mailing lists are archived and it has much higher signal to noise ratio, irc is for casual chatting so finding something important in logs is not of high concern

[14:14:53] <juri_> It's the component in a 3d printing stack that actually tells the printer where to go.

[14:15:17] <gothicserpent> but i loved it
[14:15:27] <gothicserpent> i built my own 3d flying drone

[14:19:17] <gnoo> i assume 3d printers are expensive?
[14:19:24] <gnoo> i'd be cool to own one tho
[14:19:25] <gothicserpent> yes ,very much so
[14:19:35] <gothicserpent> the prusa i had was totally diy and a little bit pricey.
[14:19:41] <juri_> nah, nowadays you can pick a fair one up for 120 euro..
[14:19:42] <gothicserpent> but it's totally worth it if you need the parts it prints
[14:19:50] <gnoo> like, your monitor stand broke, just print it!
[14:19:57] <gothicserpent> ah is it less expensive than a few years ago? maybe its cheaper now.
[14:20:04] <epony> the ones that print metal are, the ones that print plastic are varying level of overpriced and the output is not durable material
[14:20:25] <gothicserpent> it totally works like that gnoo, i printed spare parts for pots for plants, a headphone stand, etc.
[14:20:26] <epony> so you can't print a handle for an object like a computer
[14:20:32] <gothicserpent> the plant pots were great
[14:20:46] <juri_> gothicserpent: yeah, the little ones are CHEAP. in all respects. :)
[14:21:01] * gnoo can only dream *-*
[14:21:03] <epony> given that their price is 0.02 to 0.10 USD/pc
[14:21:24] <juri_> the nice part is thanks to the fact that you own a printer once you own a cheap one, you can upgrade slowly to bigger / better.

[14:23:38] <juri_> yep. was set up as a 100W laser cutter.
[14:24:31] <epony> you print some plastic junky quality then you cast rubber over it and cut it, then you pour wax in it, then fix it a bit and cast it in claw, and then you pour metal
[14:24:48] <epony> then you polish it and cast again rubber with the improved quality
[14:24:51] <gothicserpent> https://i.imgur.com/fParguy.jpg was printing a drone wing
[14:25:08] <epony> that's how idiots make gun parts and then go on the streets shooting people and in their homes

[15:51:06] <gothicserpent> vitali64: try installing weechat to a digital ocean droplet you own (for example with your web site webserver) and putting up glowing bear on your web browser at home as a frontend. I guess it's a bit more secure than having the data get sent to their matrix servers? (not trying to disparage your setup, i was honestly thinking of looking into matrix at some point)

[15:58:13] <neox> ewwegweg: if you're using an hidden service, that's clear
[15:58:20] <gnoo> ewwegweg: xmpp doesn't have a central server like matrix so you'll have to choose a server that allows tor connection

[16:00:19] <gothicserpent> ewwegweg: you can get a free vpn. cryptostorm free has a server in france. $0. kinda high latency though. just food for thought.
[16:00:57] <ewwegweg> ı use torsocks

[16:03:45] <ewwegweg> ?
[16:04:00] <neox> You're sure it uses tor, but if this is not an onion address, you probably use an exit node to connect. Many XMPP servers provide onion address to allow a more secure connection

[16:24:51] <gnoo> having the tor daemon and using it are two different things.

[19:12:47] <jxself> I don't know that I have ever seen the FSF publicly proclaim anything beyond using free software.

[19:16:39] <gnoo> xmpp is nice too, i was talking about what fsf uses
[19:16:56] <gnoo> it uses email and mailing lists as primary means
[19:17:11] <gnoo> (especially the gnu project)
[19:17:49] <ewwegweg> e mail and irc, okay.
[19:19:46] <pert> ewwegweg: the FSF does provide an XMPP server for its members to use and which I enjoy. I think XMPP is used a bit more widely by the FSFE though (IIRC they have an XMPP multi-user chat for discussion)
[19:21:09] <ewwegweg> Does the private messages see the server owner? on the irc
[19:21:17] <ewwegweg> what's the server name
[19:23:27] <pert> Sorry, I don't understand your question; did you say it backwards? The server address is jabber.member.fsf.org, but with any modern Jabber client you shouldn't need to know that
[19:24:31] <pert> If you're a member, you can find a client you like and log in with your FSF member credentials (foobar@member.fsf.org and your password)
[19:25:25] <junebug> So Microsoft just literally removed someone's name from an MIT license and put themselves as the copyright holder: https://github.com/microsoft/grpc_bench/commit/04c7143a39a0bb243369e31f3b3b797449468fdb
[19:25:52] <junebug> Seems they're also just changing licenses on projects: https://github.com/microsoft/cups/commit/ad69bcc78bdea3fea3f09fe56674daea821bb407
[19:26:19] <ewwegweg> ı am not member sorry
[19:26:30] <ewwegweg>  Does the private messages see the server owner? on the irc? dm
[19:27:25] <kompowiec> ewwegweg, ircops yes
[19:27:36] <Festive_Dragon> Hi yes
[19:27:38] <Festive_Dragon> it was a wallops
[19:27:41] <kompowiec> because IRC isn't encrypted in default, you must use OTR
[19:27:51] <Festive_Dragon> oh whoops I misread
[19:27:54] <Festive_Dragon> no, we dont see messages
[19:28:02] <Festive_Dragon> they're routed though our servers though
[19:28:12] <Festive_Dragon> so your trust in us is what matters for your privacy
[19:28:23] <Festive_Dragon> if you're concerned, there are out of band methods such as OTR
[19:28:37] <kompowiec> i perefer zero trust polity for servers
[19:28:39] <Festive_Dragon> but no, we do not have a way to read messages
[19:28:41] <kompowiec> prefer*
[19:28:49] <Festive_Dragon> kompowiec: yep! unfortunately IRC is not built that way
[19:28:57] <Festive_Dragon> but OTR exists and works well
[19:29:40] <ewwegweg> good 
[19:30:00] <Festive_Dragon> and sorry for the first response, Ive gotten a bunch of questions about wallops today >.>
[19:30:19] <kompowiec> what does it mean unbuilt? It is better if it is not by default and you can decide about it yourself, unlike signal
[19:30:34] <ewwegweg> but first ı will learn connect tor with new account
[19:30:42] <ewwegweg> anyone free?
[19:30:51] <kompowiec> because encryption is a race and has to constantly evolve.
[19:30:57] <Festive_Dragon> You're already connected with Tor
[19:30:59] <ewwegweg> to help me
