[06:47:23] <[[R]]> look at how mnay active versions are being updated
[06:47:55] <edlou> yeah i was more curious why it went from 5.13.1 to 5.14 instead of seeing a 5.13.2 5.13.3 5.13.4 etc..., i just logged onto kernel.org and saw 5.14 and thought i overslept 3 weeks :D
[06:48:12] <[[R]]> it dindt go from 5.13.1 to 5.14

[06:49:00] <edlou> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh ok sorry, so 5.14-rc1 is what is being worked on now but 5.13.1 is stable and 5.13 will still have versions published to it?
[06:49:15] <[[R]]> well, look at all the other versions
[06:49:19] <[[R]]> that were just updated yetserday
[06:49:25] <[[R]]> and then think for a few moments
[06:49:33] <edlou> yeah for lts i understand those
[06:49:40] <rascul> 5.13 will likely (but not necessarily) keep going for a bit
[06:49:49] <[[R]]> 5.12 isn't lts...
[06:49:53] <edlou> i never said it was
[06:49:59] <edlou> but you're being technical, so let me do the same
[06:50:03] <[[R]]> then why are you ignorign the fact that that has 5.12.16
[06:50:08] <edlou> im not
[06:50:08] <[[R]]> yet there is 5.13.1 and 5.14
[06:50:15] <edlou> i asked a question 3 times
[06:50:26] <rascul> nothing was skipped
[06:50:41] <rascul> they felt there was enough to bump from 5.13 to 5.14 so they did it
[06:50:46] <edlou> is there any specific reason why 5.13 didnt get too far into 5.13.X before 5.14 got so much traction?

[10:14:47] <wwalker> well, Xorg doesn't know about workspaces, but workspaces are kind of imaginary.  they don't exist,workspaces are just  lists of which windows are currently visible.  The window manager (usually) manages those lists and tells the windows that they should or should not be visible
[10:14:47] <Kyv> its got endless scripting possibility and a heap of patches to configure it any way you like

[10:16:05] <CoJaBo> Is there any way I can rsync (or similar) off a filesystem (APFS) that allows VERY exotic characters in filenames? I need to translate them to something else, obviously, but is there a sane way to do that?

[11:47:24] <Sauvin> So, the total number of instructions executed in a single second depends on the mix of instructions used. I think you'll find it'll most often be characterised as "average number of instructions per second", and that that number will be quite a bit lower than two billion.
[11:47:56] <Sauvin> It depends on a number of other things, too, including the type of CPU.

[12:33:54] <wyre> where is defined that variable? (CONFIG_WATCHDOG)
[12:33:55] <curdlesnoot> wyre: yes. if you have the 4.19 kernel's config to hand, you could review it to find out.
[12:34:04] <bryan> what do you mean?
[12:34:27] <curdlesnoot> wyre: they're often stored in /boot. or, if running the kernel in question, /proc/config.gz might be available. otherwise, you'd have to poke around upstream.
[12:34:31] <wyre> curdlesnoot, I don't know where can I find the 4.19 kernel's config for Debian 🤔
[12:34:38] <wyre> oh
[12:34:44] <node1> bryan, Just  wanted to know on what basis they count the compuation speed of  their respective processor
[12:34:50] <bryan> I mean more like, another example ISP's advertise up to X internet speed, and most poeple see that and go 'oh X thats fast'
[12:34:57] <bryan> but while using the service you'll never actually reach that speed
[12:35:40] <wyre> curdlesnoot, both have CONFIG_WATCHDOG=y

[12:35:56] <curdlesnoot> wyre: hmm. then neither should have a watchdog.ko module, in principle.

[12:38:22] <bryan> in either case node1 I'm pretty sure they use the speed of the clock/timing hardware
[12:38:39] <bryan> since a CPU by itself doesn't just cycle, it needs to be provided with a timer to know when to 'tick'

[15:55:34] <akik> so i'm not a fan. if you don't know how to behave, a coc doesn't make you suddenly behave

[17:13:37] <chives> BCMM, i think so, wanting to firewall between them
[17:13:44] <koollman> most switches these days can do line-rate with pretty much any packet size. Which makes them pretty efficient and hard to beat

[17:14:27] <chives> if you need fw

[17:16:18] <chives> if I can even move my camera it may even be too much

[19:43:51] <BCMM> those are totally permissible in normal linux filesystems
[19:44:06] <curdlesnoot> indeed. something about this account doesn't add up.
[19:44:12] <CoJaBo> BCMM: Destination volume has to be readable on Mac, which pretty much limits me to exfat
[19:44:32] <peetaur> if rsync can't handle a thing, just use -s
[19:44:38] <BCMM> CoJaBo: right, so you're copying these files to exfat?
[19:44:41] <CoJaBo> Yes
[19:44:58] <peetaur> (note they say rsync -s using rsync protocol instead of ssh or something is somehow insecure)
[19:45:05] <BCMM> CoJaBo: so how come it's md5sum and rsync that are causing problems?
[19:45:16] <BCMM> CoJaBo: i mean surely it's just impossible to create those files on the exfat FS in the first place?

[20:57:33] <simbaclaws> I currently have the ssd connected to my main desktop, and I don't have a mouse + keyboard + display on my raspberry pi connected. So can I install this onto the ssd somehow from within my current linux os? Or do I have to set this up on the pi?

[21:00:08] <simbaclaws> I have 3 high speed usb devices connected to a usb switch, which is then connected to a single port on my desktop. These usb devices tend to randomly connect and disconnect.
[21:00:21] <simbaclaws> I haven't tried with other distro's or live usb's yet
[21:00:42] <Dagmar> Try a different switch
[21:00:44] <simbaclaws> I figured it was a power draw issue so I bought a 5v dc adapter and plugged it into the usb switch

[22:01:57] <The_Blode> I think it's Gnome but not 100%
[22:02:03] <swl> The_Blode: What distro?
[22:02:07] <The_Blode> Linux Mint
[22:02:10] <The_Blode> 20
[22:02:14] <Gustavo6046> peetaur: I appreciate your suggestions, but I fear I don't muster the SSD necessary. :(
[22:02:40] <The_Blode> I think it's Cinnamon maybe
[22:02:42] <swl> That's cinnamon, so I'd try baobo
[22:02:49] <Gustavo6046> I already have some swap on zram; swap is often used like a file cache if I recall correctly.
[22:02:50] <peetaur> Gustavo6046: SSDs are so much faster for random IO that they are well worth it... so to get lots of that advantage but low price of hdds, combine them with bcache
[22:02:56] <The_Blode> Thank you guys for suggestions let me try baobo thank you again
[22:02:59] <peetaur> nothing is "necessary" ...but it's worth the cost
[22:03:04] <Meisterbrau|2> i saw linux mint cinnamon 18.3 ormore
[22:03:27] <Gustavo6046> But when the RAM bottlenecks (and there is swap space available), my system still gets very slow and it takes going to htop to kill, say, ld.
[22:03:35] <swl>  Meisterbrau|2: no, what's the error message?
[22:03:40] <NthDegree> The_Blode, it uses Cinnamon by default which handles gnome apps... it's called baobab my bad :D

[22:08:52] <Gustavo6046> There are leftover HDDs somewhere but they're all old and small
[22:09:46] <BCMM> simbaclaws: there's no reason, on any Pi, that you couldn't have the root filesystem on USB storage. depending on which version of the Pi 2 you have, you may or may not need an SD card to *boot* it, though
[22:10:17] <BCMM> simbaclaws: see https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md
[22:10:26] <Dagmar> You pretty much have to have a microsd card to boot anything before the 4

[22:12:01] <Dagmar> Yeah the 3B+ is basically the only exception to that rule and it didn't work when it first came out
[22:12:21] <Gustavo6046> I'm willing to buy RAM, and an SSD, with my tokens :)

[22:12:50] <Dagmar> If someone tries and it won't boot off the Raspbian image flashed to a thumbdrive (and the thumbdrive actually works) they'll need to boot it from a microSD card once and do the rpi-update dance
