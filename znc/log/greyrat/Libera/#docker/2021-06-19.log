[01:34:56] <Lutin> artok okay but don't you have your vhosts in your nginx conf.d mapped then ?
[01:35:05] <artok> no
[01:35:56] <Lutin> artok mhh okay... what about overhead in that case ? multiple vhosts in one nginx container vs another container ?
[01:36:27] <artok> service cluster per vhost
[01:36:42] <Lutin> artok also... what if your nginx needs to talk to PHP ? You need a manual config for it
[01:36:52] <Lutin> artok yeah I feel the same

[01:37:39] <artok> if nginx needs to talk to php, it will do that, but I won't touch that project =)

[21:45:54] <rawtaz> i got errors when i tried to set data-dir in daemon.json to a path that is on a ZFS filesystem. apparently the overlay2 storage driver doesnt like that. can someone explain in simple terms why docker has to care about what filesystem the storage of files is done on? one could think that it shouldnt care about that, that it should just store the files there as any other process.

[21:54:08] <artok> rawtaz: afaik it is kernel thing
[21:55:22] <rawtaz> i see
[21:56:29] <rawtaz> another thing i dont quite get, just out of curiosity. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#zfs-options says "By default docker will pick up the zfs filesystem where docker graph (/var/lib/docker) is located". i had added  "data-root": "/data/docker"  in daemon.json, but when starting docker it gave errors about storage driver not supported. its only when i also added  "storage-driver": "zfs"  that it started fine.
[21:57:18] <rawtaz> any idea why it didnt "see" that the data-root i specified was a zfs filesystem? having to add that last setting seems to contradict the documentation there, unless that sentence only applies to when you are using the default path for data-root

[21:57:43] *** Quits: goldfish (~goldfish@user/goldfish) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:00:14] <rawtaz> hm i wonder if one can just rename the overlay2 dir in data-root to zfs when changing the driver as part of moving the entire data-dir..
[22:00:20] <rawtaz> lets try it, i guess :>
[22:01:24] <artok> did you move the data?
[22:01:27] <artok> or copy?
[22:02:02] <artok> it needs to be fresh empty dir to be able to detect and set driver
[22:03:22] <rawtaz> artok: i havent moved anything yet, it's still in /var/lib/docker but i noticed theres a dir in there which is named overlay2 which contains a lot of hashes. but a vanilla dockerd with data-dir being /data/docker/ creates a zfs dir instead of overlay2, so i presume that the same hash dirs should be stored in there instead of overlay2
[22:03:58] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)
[22:04:02] <rawtaz> yeah, when i had first just set data-root and started docker, there was nothing in /data/docker, so i guess for some reason it failed to detect zfs. no biggie though
