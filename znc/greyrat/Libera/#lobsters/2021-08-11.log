[18:58:57] <JordiGH> companion_cube: Yeah, but not all of those digits are precise.

[18:59:59] <JordiGH> It is the same rounding, just in base 10, not in base 2. The base 2 rounding is what people consider the crazy part of hardware floats. But it's still rounding!
[19:00:19] <ignaloidas> base 2 is unexpected for most though
[19:00:29] <ignaloidas> and it's the unexpected things that suck
[19:00:45] <gwozniak> Doesn't the accuracy change based on how close it is to 0, too?

[19:01:12] <JordiGH> gwozniak: Not for hardware floats... unless you mean subnormal numbers?
[19:01:20] <companion_cube> gwozniak: it does, because the precision of mantissa and exponents are fixed
[19:01:34] <JordiGH> companion_cube: That's not precision! the number of digits is not precision!
[19:01:41] <JordiGH> Also, it's not a mantissa, it's a significand.
[19:01:44] <gwozniak> Yeah, I remember that

[19:20:21] <companion_cube> if you still get rounding, just a bit less weird, is it truly better?
