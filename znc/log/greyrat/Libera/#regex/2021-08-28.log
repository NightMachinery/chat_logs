[12:16:06] <purplex> interesting, maybe he added .* at the end himself :p
[12:17:23] <purplex> but i really thought it would be {2,} - more than one
[12:18:10] <digitok> 2 is more than one
[12:18:50] <digitok> if he only wanted true/false, that's all he needed
[12:20:12] <digitok> in other news, i'm about 80% through doing the comments
[12:20:18] <purplex> 3 is also more than 1 lol
[12:20:57] <digitok> but it wouldn't match 2 ;)
[12:21:10] <friend> 1 is the loneliest number, except for maybe 0
[12:21:25] <purplex> i don't care about what solution he got, but how he wrote the problem
[12:21:25] <digitok> thankfully we have friend
[12:21:31] <Me-me> In this instance, purplex, it wasn't necessary to match the full line - he only wanted to identify lines that had the specified criterion.
[12:21:53] <Me-me> So {2,} and .* aren't necessary - just the barest minimum to match at the start is sufficient.
[12:22:05] <purplex> when he said "rest can be any" seemed to imply .*
[12:22:25] <Me-me> It also implies "I don't need to care about the contents of the rest of the line in any way".
[12:22:32] <Me-me> Can also imply, I mean.
[12:22:43] <digitok> indeed, it was open to interpretation
[12:22:46] <purplex> yep
[12:22:50] <digitok> but his response suggests he only required the former
[12:23:02] <digitok> the latter rather
[12:23:17] <Me-me> To put it another way, he wanted a boolean, not an extraction.
[12:25:07] <digitok> it's also worth nothing that there was no /m
[12:25:23] <digitok> noting* :>
[12:25:24] <purplex> That's what he confirmed after seeing solution, sometimes I'm more interested look at problem description rather than what they want.
[12:26:28] <digitok> by no /m i mean the input is likely to be a single line, meaning he either already knows the string, or it's being used in something like grep which returns matching lines
[12:27:16] <purplex> I have seen some people who'd accept a solution (even if it wasn't really their solution) out of gratitude maybe?
[12:27:18] <digitok> but who knows, it's a complex mystery
[12:27:39] <digitok> well yea, Me-me is quite scary
[12:28:02] <Me-me> I intimidate with my mere presence.
[12:28:25] <Me-me> If he were accepting it without it working he wouldn't have first said he'd test it, and he wouldn't have confirmed that it worked.
[12:29:25] <friend> and your tautolgy itself.
[12:29:38] <digitok> the important thing is that we've explored all possible scenarios
[12:30:12] <purplex> That's what purple charts are for!
[12:30:27] <Me-me> I was trying not to be too sarcastic.
[12:30:42] <digitok> eff for effort
[12:30:46] <Me-me> Also that's not a tautology, that's being self-evident.
[12:33:35] <purplex> I find that looking at the big picture cleanses and expands the mind out any biases and ill-will thoughts.
[12:33:51] <Me-me> :P
[12:34:39] <friend> Were we both talking about your name, Me-me? Or did I miss something.
[12:36:00] <Me-me> Ohh, nevermind. I thought you were talking about something entirely different.

[19:25:42] <digitok> you didn't read what i said did you
[19:25:51] <digitok> specifically the part about it not working in np++ yet
[19:26:07] <digitok> as well as how to make it work in np++ AFTER checking that it works correctly on re101
[19:26:35] <re101-moth-80> When I used (?1czeslaw)(?2outlaw)(?3inlaw)(?4bylaw)  in the replace field, all the `&lt;` were replaced with outlaw and all the &gt; were replaced with inlaw
[19:27:48] <re101-moth-80> but the first $lt; and the <p.....<span........&lt; remain and so does the last bit
[19:28:28] <digitok> seems wrong
[19:28:34] <re101-moth-80> So, is there anything I can use to make it work?
[19:28:45] <digitok> can you confirm it works on re101
[19:32:11] <re101-moth-80> Shucks, I tried but it looks like I don't know how to run it on re101
[19:32:29] <digitok> eh?
[19:32:33] <digitok> i already did it
[19:32:37] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/M5giyn/2
[19:32:39] <re101-moth-80> It asks for a test string to run but it doesn't accept it
[19:32:45] <digitok> just check the output
[19:35:38] <re101-moth-80> When I used (?1czeslaw)(?2outlaw)(?3inlaw)(?4bylaw)  in the replace field, all the `&lt;` were replaced with outlaw and all the `&gt;` were replaced with inlaw
[19:36:46] <re101-moth-80> but the first &lt; and the <p.....<span........before it remain and so does the last bit (</span>.....</p>)
[19:39:06] <re101-moth-80> sorry, only the last bit (</span>.....</p>) remains
[19:39:20] <re101-moth-80> everything else got replaced
[19:39:27] <re101-moth-80> as it should have
[19:44:54] <re101-moth-80> If you are finding it difficult, I'll use your present RegEx and then your earlier RegEx, `(?-i)MODALITIES(?:[^<]+|<(?!p))*+\K<p[^>]*><span[^>]*>((?:[^<]+|<(?!\/span))*+)(?:[^<]+|<(?!\/p))*+<\/p>`
[19:45:47] <re101-moth-80> your present RegEx replaxces the strings in between and the earlier one replaces the first and last bits
[19:48:29] <re101-moth-80> R U still here digitok?
[19:49:10] <digitok> no
[19:50:45] <re101-moth-80> :') 
[19:53:33] <re101-moth-80> R U working on it or shud I use your present RegEx and then your earlier RegEx, `(?-i)MODALITIES(?:[^<]+|<(?!p))*+\K<p[^>]*><span[^>]*>&lt;((?:[^<]+|<(?!\/span))*+)(?:[^<]+|<(?!\/p))*+<\/p>` ?
[19:56:22] <digitok> i'm waiting for purplex as he claims it works in np++
[19:56:26] <digitok> :)
[19:58:22] <re101-moth-80> I told you that the first bit, the &lt; and &gt; all are replaced but the last bit (</span> to </p>) remains unreplced
[19:59:01] <re101-moth-80> purplex can't get a different result
[19:59:49] *** Quits: d1cor (~diego@179.63.242.114) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[20:00:39] <re101-moth-80> I tried it 2 more times with the same result
[20:02:41] <re101-moth-80> `czeslaw`, `outlaw`, `inlaw` appear after the replacement but `bylaw` doesn't
[20:02:54] <digitok> it wouldn't be the first time someone got a different result
[20:02:58] <digitok> so we shall see
[20:03:04] <re101-moth-80> OK
[20:03:10] <re101-moth-80> u r the boss
[20:03:15] <re101-moth-80> I'll wait
[20:03:15] <digitok> correct
[20:04:02] <digitok> there's also not much i can do since i don't know why it would partially work
[20:04:04] <re101-moth-80> purplex probably tweaked something somewhere
[20:06:35] <digitok> he's probably busy cooking some type of vegetable with vapourised water
[20:10:05] <re101-moth-80> ......and I'm turning purple just waiting
[20:11:37] <purplex> yea i just came back after vegetables sorting
[20:13:10] <purplex> are you asking if regex works same as regex101 in np++?
[20:13:52] <digitok> yes
[20:14:12] <purplex> its same
[20:14:42] <digitok> screenshot? :p
[20:17:01] <purplex> https://i.imgur.com/eUsEbg5.png
[20:17:24] <purplex> lol
[20:17:37] <purplex> i can't do teamviewer sorry
[20:17:39] <testuser[m]> !karma np
[20:17:41] <perlbot> np has karma of 207
[20:17:54] <digitok> imagine that
[20:17:55] <testuser[m]> test np++
[20:18:05] <re101-moth-80> Can you post the RegEx you used purplex?
[20:18:07] <purplex> if he wants me to come over there and control his np++ remotely and run it
[20:18:12] <testuser[m]> !karma np
[20:18:14] <perlbot> np has karma of 209
[20:18:43] <purplex> its the same regex from https://regex101.com/r/M5giyn/2
[20:19:49] <purplex> btw, you need to show screenshots of how you are using the regex, so we can check mistakes
[20:20:57] <digitok> <re101-moth-80> purplex can't get a different result - based on this, he gets the same result as you, so looks like it works :p
[20:21:20] <purplex> i met someone here before who had no idea how to use notepad++ correctly, couldn't even copy and paste correctly
[20:21:52] <digitok> hey Me-me has learned np++ since then
[20:22:05] <Me-me> Hey.
[20:22:25] <re101-moth-80> OK, I'll do as I said earlier. I'll use your first RegEx (what you gave me earlier) and then today's
[20:22:50] <re101-moth-80> No point wasting your time
[20:23:21] <digitok> no screenshot then?
[20:23:34] <re101-moth-80> OK, I'll do that
[20:23:47] <digitok> 50purplex, ordered it
[20:24:03] <digitok> minus highlighting
[20:24:25] <purplex> finally, my name was mentioned lol
[20:24:36] <purplex> i wanted to see what purple it was
[20:24:54] <digitok> hehe
[20:27:43] <re101-moth-80> Can you tell me how to take a screenshot of my NP++ result and then how to create a link?
[20:27:58] <re101-moth-80> ......and post it here
[20:29:25] <digitok> press print screen on your keyboard
[20:29:39] <digitok> then go to www.imgbb.com and press ctrl+v
[20:32:35] <re101-moth-80> On my laptop, the PRTSC is mentioned below the `END` button but pressing it just took me to the end of the line
[20:33:20] <digitok> hold FN and then press it
[20:40:42] <re101-moth-80> not working
[20:41:52] <digitok> there won't be any confirmation that it worked if that's what you mean
[20:42:02] <digitok> it just goes in your clipboard
[20:43:04] <re101-moth-80> Oh
[20:46:06] <re101-moth-80> OK, it looks like it was copied but when I post it to a word doc, the imgbb.com website is not accepting it
[20:46:42] <re101-moth-80> In waht format should I post it for imgbb.com to accept it?
[20:47:00] <digitok> you just paste it directly into imgbb.com by pressing ctrl+v
[20:47:06] <re101-moth-80> OK
[20:49:58] <re101-moth-80> https://ibb.co/album/qC8vqg
[20:50:45] <re101-moth-80> As you can see, the last bit is not replaced
[20:51:19] <digitok> fix it purplex
[20:51:46] <re101-moth-80> Purplex, I am perplexed as to how you got it right
[20:52:23] <re101-moth-80> U can C what I did/used in the image above
[20:53:41] <digitok> he used wrap around but i would't expect that to make a diff
[20:54:00] <digitok> maybe it's windows 7 lol
[20:54:30] <re101-moth-80> yea, it is Windows 7
[20:56:35] <re101-moth-80> digitok, maybe you shud work on it, purplex is still figuring out what to do with the latest Taliban news
[21:01:37] <purplex> yea weird
[21:01:45] <re101-moth-80> I think I shud use your present RegEx (today's) and then your earlier one. It will save everyone's time
[21:01:53] <purplex> you had 16 matches instead of 10?
[21:02:26] <re101-moth-80> Yea digitok but I had pasted your RegEx also below
[21:02:40] <re101-moth-80> ....so that may have been counted
[21:03:02] <re101-moth-80> ...that was also replced
[21:04:46] <purplex> you can re-do properly, and show extended window with full regex again
[21:05:26] <re101-moth-80> digitok, I think I shud use your present RegEx (today's) and then your earlier one. It will save everyone's time
[21:06:49] <purplex> the regex is working, you need to test it properly and save everyone's time
[21:07:02] <re101-moth-80> OK, I removed that lst RegEx and it worked
[21:07:28] <re101-moth-80> ....but can I use that RefgEx for all my files in a particular folder?
[21:08:02] <re101-moth-80> RegEx
[21:08:06] <purplex> well test and see it.
[21:08:18] <re101-moth-80> OK, thanks a lot
[21:08:25] <re101-moth-80> .....purplex and digitok
[21:08:36] <purplex> I saved everyone's time
[21:08:46] <re101-moth-80> Yea, thanks
[21:08:56] <purplex> np
[21:10:45] <re101-moth-80> ihn the files of that particular folder, I have the same problem
[21:10:51] <re101-moth-80> *in
[21:11:06] <re101-moth-80> the last bit is not replaced
[21:11:25] <purplex> that might need a new regex101 link
[21:12:48] <re101-moth-80> `(?-i)MODALITIES(?:[^<]+|<(?!p))*+\K<p[^>]*><span[^>]*>&lt;()|\G(?!\A)(?:(?:[^&]+|&(?![lg]t;))*+\K&(?:l()|g())t;|(?:[^<]+|<(?!/span))*+\K</span>(?:[^<]+|<(?!/p))*+</p>())` is the RegEx I used
[21:13:18] <re101-moth-80> .....with `(?1czeslaw)(?2outlaw)(?3inlaw)(?4bylaw)` in the replace field
[21:13:41] <purplex> ok that looks same as before and test string?
[21:14:34] <re101-moth-80> test string is the same but it has more paragraphs below which I did not put in the test string here for brevity
[21:15:00] <re101-moth-80> Could you tweak it a bit to make it work purplex?

[21:16:40] <re101-moth-80> The whole matter in that html file?
[21:16:41] <purplex> no tweaks without new test string

[21:21:41] <re101-moth-80> I'm turning purple waiting for you purplex
[21:25:03] <purplex> Rather turn blue since its digitok's proposed regex and he's knows your requirements
[21:26:01] <purplex> Also, HTML isn't one of my specialized areas for regex :p
[21:26:12] <purplex> I was only helping you testing in np++.
[21:28:22] <re101-moth-80> OK, so you give up?
[21:29:31] <purplex> What do you mean?
[21:30:03] <re101-moth-80> So, you can't work out a solution is it?
[21:30:36] <re101-moth-80> *figure out
[21:31:36] <purplex> I could but you better wait for someone who gave you the regex so I don't have to re-write it from scratch.
[21:32:17] <re101-moth-80> digitok has gone on Honeymoon to Afghanistan, if that is who you mean
[21:32:45] <re101-moth-80> .....with Malal Yusufzai

[21:43:46] <re101-moth-80> still the same problem digitok, the last bit is replaced only if it is the last string of a file but if there is more matter below, the last string is not replaced
[21:54:16] <re101-moth-80> I guess you guys are busy
[21:56:11] <re101-moth-80> No problem, I'll use today's RegEx and then the earlier one. It should work fine
