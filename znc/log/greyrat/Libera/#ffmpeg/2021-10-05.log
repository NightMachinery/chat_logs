[01:44:05] <TRIMmadness> Hi. I have a question. I have an hevx/ac3/mkv file whose audio I synced using the -itsoffset method. This ended with a file with an audio than begins earlier than the video... which is causing a series of problems. How can I use ffmpeg to delete the 'audio excess' ?

[01:49:54] <LikWidChz> OH hey the channel exists, weird question. X264 encoding with a ryzen 5950x is it normal that I cant whore all my cpus at once? when I use handbrake it seems to top out at ~65% cpu usage
[01:50:05] *** Joins: h-m-h (~hmh@193.27.14.101)
[01:50:26] <DeHackEd> throwing more cores at a job does eventually hit some limit
[01:50:28] <BtbN> TRIMmadness, I'd imagine just -ss'ing over the overhang at the start when doing -c copy could do the trick
[01:50:42] <BtbN> LikWidChz, x264 does not scale with more threads infinitely
[01:50:58] <BtbN> With 1080p, somewhere around 8 threads it starts to hit heavy diminishing returns
[01:51:00] <LikWidChz> ahhh well I went from an i5-3970k to this so LOL A JUMP
[01:51:21] <DeHackEd> oh that's huge... that's 4 core no-SMT to 16 core with SMT
[01:51:32] <DeHackEd> not to mention basically a decade of generational improvements
[01:51:37] <LikWidChz> x265 does seem to use it though so is it an X264 limitation?
[01:51:59] <LikWidChz> like I was like when I got this thing... lets see how fast video encodes, and I literally just started laughing at it
[01:52:18] <DeHackEd> multithreading does hit a limit when the act of coordinating all those threads, even at the OS level, becomes the bottleneck. x265 hits the CPU at lot harder so that bottleneck means less
[01:52:53] <LikWidChz> ahhh gotcha gotcha, yeah Im just re encoding some 1080p content to 720p x264 @ CQ of 18
[01:53:02] <LikWidChz> and its going at 66fps
[01:53:16] <LikWidChz> previously on very slow on my old machine it went at ~4 or 6
[01:53:37] <DeHackEd> sounds about right
[01:54:02] <TRIMmadness> BtbNI tried that, -ss 0.000,  but it wreaks havoc with the beginning of the video stream.
[01:54:09] <LikWidChz> yeah, I guess is there or are there some encode settings I can specify in handbrake to go full ham?
[01:54:16] <TRIMmadness> BtbN I tried that, -ss 0.000,  but it wreaks havoc with the beginning of the video stream.
[01:54:41] <LikWidChz> like I remember using tempeg for ripping VCDs millions of years ago
[01:55:15] <BtbN> x264 just really doesn't scale infinitely
[01:55:28] <BtbN> x265 scales a lot wider, but also has limits somewhere
[01:57:10] <LikWidChz> I see! well im wondering if I were to encode x265 is there a CQ setting or a 2 pass VBR bitrate I should be using? I know ages ago, i remember seeing this chart where it was for great settings you had to use so many bits per pixel, then you just do the math on what resolution you target and plop in those numbers and go to town.. does that exist for x265? for 720p
[01:57:35] <BtbN> define cq? You mean -crf?

[01:57:55] <LikWidChz> yeah costant quality the handbrake option, I think thats the same thing as constant rate factor
[01:58:15] <BtbN> You just set the one with the desired quality/size ratio
[01:58:15] <LikWidChz> in handbrake for x264, I use 18
[01:58:20] <BtbN> there is no "perfect"

[01:59:04] <LikWidChz> yeah I hear you there, but ovbiously with x265 you can use less bits to get the same quality output as x264 with more bitrate
[01:59:22] <LikWidChz> then saying that, how does one actually/technically compare quality?
[01:59:41] <LikWidChz> call my neighbor over and say "HEY, which one of these looks better" lol
[02:00:20] <LikWidChz> for some reason this term PPSNR or something rather is sticking out?
[02:02:45] <BtbN> psnr is useless
[02:02:56] <BtbN> vmaf not so much, but really just look at the video and judge if its good enough

[02:03:12] <LikWidChz> heh oh I was hoping for a glorified answer
[02:03:34] <BtbN> If you want perfect quality, go lossless
[02:03:50] <BtbN> it's always a tradeof between size and quality, and only you can decide what kind of tradeof you want
[02:04:06] <LikWidChz> yeah well again I was tempted.... tempted to take a bunch of 1080p content and downsize it to some smaller file size for saving, not wasting as much space type of thing.
[02:04:22] <BtbN> If you already have a compressed video, don't touch it
[02:04:29] <BtbN> you can never make it better, only ever worse
[02:04:36] <LikWidChz> yeah I hear you, oh yeah I know that.
[02:05:45] <LikWidChz> like no joke about 15 years ago this guy came into a store I worked at and was like "do you have any video software that can enlarge video so I can read a newspaper in the background" after a couple back and forth follow up questions, i told him "yeah that software doesnt exist" he stomped off.

[13:18:48] <roxlu> How would you deal with this situation: when a publisher (e.g. OBS) starts sending rtmp to ffmpeg I see that it takes some time before the connection has been setup and then after the connection has been setup we receive a burst of frames. This means that when we're using dash, that the availabilityStartTime is "incorrect". When the connection setup takes 2s and we receive a burst of 1.5s for
[13:18:50] <roxlu> example, a player will always be ~2s "behind" real-time.  I created a sketch to visualize this; https://imgur.com/a/lUpXkg7
[13:19:41] <BtbN> That's pretty normal behaviour of rtmp I think
[13:19:47] <BtbN> are you using nginx-rtmp or something?
[13:21:22] <roxlu> No, I'm using a custom implementation that uses ffmpeg

[13:21:37] <roxlu> I never really thought about this, but I'm wondering if there are ways to deal with this
[13:21:38] <BtbN> So you wrote your own rtmp server?
[13:21:45] <roxlu> we're feeding data into ffmpeg
[13:22:06] <roxlu> I'm using the ffmpeg libs basically
[13:22:12] <BtbN> If you're writing the server yourself, just discard the initial burst?
[13:22:50] <BtbN> But what are you using as rtmp server? I hope not the minimal hacky thing that's in avformat?
[13:23:24] <roxlu> lol I'm pretty sure it's the rtmp from avformat (I just started helping someone who build the thing)

[14:30:31] <BtbN> Or just straight up discard the first X seconds or something
[14:31:20] <AMM> For my IP cam rtmp shenanigans I decide a wallclock time to start accepting frames from
[14:32:21] <AMM> Kinda stronghanded, but I also have other aspects (I don't want to trust the timestamps the chinacams give me, they're offset anyway, and I want to align my start times to N seconds for other things)
[14:33:20] <roxlu> AMM: so you receive your first frame from the came, then set a timeout to actually start streaming/using the frames?
[14:34:09] <AMM> Nah, it's less relevant/similar to your case, just dealing with the same initial burst
[14:34:45] <roxlu> Ok
[14:34:59] <AMM> I use ffmpeg.c with setpts replacing pts with wallclock, and then select filter dropping pts under a decided sync point
[14:36:52] <AMM> For your case as mentioned it'd be easiest to just drop the first N seconds, if you can'
[14:37:04] <AMM> can't compel the dash clients to sync up
[14:37:31] <roxlu> thanks, that's indeed what I'm going to look into
