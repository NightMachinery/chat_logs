[03:56:26] <chiselfuse> IDK, try

[03:57:14] <chiselfuse> I think it should kill its child too
[03:57:43] <thebombzen> I ended up solving it by sending SIGINT to the terminal that was bash's parent but it felt gross, which is why I asked
[03:57:59] <thebombzen> not entirely sure how bash itself in interactive mode responds to SIGTERM, which is the source of the question
[03:58:31] <chiselfuse> I think it just ends
[03:58:49] <thebombzen> does it leave its children dangling or does it send SIGTERM to them too
[03:59:27] <chiselfuse> And then the kernel does that to the children too since bash was the group parent

[04:03:29] <thebombzen> kurahaupo: do:;? what does the : do in this case
[04:03:59] <kurahaupo> thebombzen: ":" is a valid null command
[04:04:15] <thebombzen> ah, so it's basically like "true" here
[04:04:22] <thebombzen> so this is equivalent to something like, while do_thing && sleep 10m; do true; done
[04:04:25] <kurahaupo> you must have at least one command between do and done
[04:04:29] <kurahaupo> yes
[04:05:24] <thebombzen> also, why is "do" its own command in block form but not in inline form
[04:06:07] <kurahaupo> If I was modifying the shell, I would make the "do COMMANDS" optional in "while" and "until" loops.
[04:06:25] <thebombzen> same with "then"
[04:06:26] <kurahaupo> thebombzen: What do you mean by "inline form"?
[04:06:47] <thebombzen> kurahaupo: this is fine: while sleep 1; do echo foo; done
[04:07:01] <thebombzen> as is this: while sleep 1; do\n echo foo; done
[04:07:21] <kurahaupo> there's a "do" and a statement there. What difference are you talking about
[04:07:23] <thebombzen> but this is not: while sleep 1; do; echo foo; done
[04:07:45] <thebombzen> I'm wondering why a newline after a "do" statement is legal but a semicolon is not, you have to omit it
[04:08:06] <edk> semicolons in general are not equivalent to newlines
[04:08:07] <emanuele6> while sleep 1; do\ndone wouldn't work either
[04:08:08] <thebombzen> this is inconsistent with my understanding that a semicolon or a newline end a statement in bash. clearly I'm missing something
[04:08:14] <kurahaupo> newlines are permitted as replacements for semicolons but not vice versa
[04:08:42] <edk> you also can't have a semicolon after &
[04:08:44] <thebombzen> kurahaupo: why does this work then: while sleep 1; do \n echo foo; done
[04:08:46] <kurahaupo> The shell grammar is defined in terms of semicolons, which may be replaced by newlines
[04:09:02] <thebombzen> if a semicolon does not work where that newline is
[04:09:14] <edk> thebombzen: because of the "not vice versa" part
[04:09:18] <kurahaupo> newlines are also allowed where they won't terminate a statement or list
[04:09:20] <emanuele6> thebombzen: that is interpreted as while sleep 1; do echo foo; done
[04:10:01] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[04:10:21] <thebombzen> so you're saying that if I write something like: if true; then \n echo foo; fi
[04:10:31] <thebombzen> that the "then" statement is not terminated by the newline
[04:10:35] <kurahaupo> you can freely insert newlines after if, then, else, elif, while, until, do, &&, &, ||, |

[04:11:20] <thebombzen> so the newline doesn't terminate the statement, and since the statement cannot legally be terminated there, it just continues on the next line as a space basically
[04:11:30] <kurahaupo> correct
[04:11:41] <thebombzen> this clears up my confusion, thank you
[04:12:15] <kurahaupo> edk: yes those too

[04:14:39] <kurahaupo> Personally I only use "; then" and "; do" when the entire condition fits on one line, otherwise I use newline instead of semicolon, to make it clearer where the condition ends and the subordinate statements begin
[04:16:19] <kurahaupo> thebombzen: It's only confusing if one's other languages all use semicolons as statement terminators. There are plenty of languages that don't
[04:16:42] <kurahaupo> or newlines as terminators, ditto
[04:16:59] <thebombzen> kurahaupo: most languages I've found that use newlines allow semicolons
[04:17:10] <kurahaupo> in Pascal, for instance, newlines are just whitespace

[04:17:23] <thebombzen> python does either or, for example
[04:17:37] <thebombzen> although python also has the same property where newlines don't terminate statements if the grammar does not allow them to be terminated
[04:17:46] *** Joins: mtk (~mtk@2601:185:200:72:44aa:53fe:886b:bee9)
[04:17:56] <kurahaupo> Python is at the extreme end of whitespace sensitivity. (In a good way, if you ask me.)
[04:18:00] <thebombzen> and instead behaves like a line continuation. I guess the confusing part here is the understanding of how "then" and "do" work
[04:18:20] <kurahaupo> # help while
[04:18:21] <shbot> kurahaupo: while: while COMMANDS; do COMMANDS; done -- http://ix.io/aSn
[04:18:31] <thebombzen> no, I meant, more like
[04:18:59] <thebombzen> most people who see "if foo; then" will think it probably behaves like it does in most other languages with "if... then"
[04:19:39] <thebombzen> whereas in bash, as you've now explained, "then" marks the first statement after an if statement (for seemingly no reason)
[04:20:16] <emanuele6> thebombzen: why no reason?
[04:20:26] <thebombzen> now that I know how it works, it seems, uh, awfully unnecessary to have "then" and "do" even be part of the language
[04:20:27] <emanuele6> you can have multiple commands between if and then
[04:20:32] <kurahaupo> Well, that misapprehension could be remedied by careful reading of "help if" where it's clear that the condition and the subordinate commands are in fact the same grammatical element: a list of commands, terminated by a semicolon
[04:20:38] <emanuele6> # help if | head -1
[04:20:39] <shbot> emanuele6: if: if COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; [ elif COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; ]... [ else COMMANDS; ] fi
[04:20:46] <emanuele6> # help while | head -1
[04:20:48] <shbot> emanuele6: while: while COMMANDS; do COMMANDS; done
[04:20:55] <emanuele6> COMMANDS, not COMMAND
[04:21:06] <thebombzen> ... huh. what does that look like?
[04:21:27] <kurahaupo> if cmd1; cmd2; cmd3; then cnd4; fi
[04:21:43] <thebombzen> does it only care about the exit status of cmd3?
[04:21:50] <emanuele6> if a=$(something); [[ $a == *% ]]; then echo ends with %; fi
[04:21:59] <kurahaupo> ^^ the exit status of cmd3 is what counts
[04:22:17] <thebombzen> so is there any real difference between that and cmd1; cmd2; if cmd3; then cmd4; fi
[04:22:38] <kurahaupo> This might seem a bit pointless for "if", but it's more useful with "elif"
[04:22:45] <emanuele6> in while it is more noticeable
[04:22:58] <emanuele6> while a=$(something); [[ $a == *% ]]; echo still ends with %; done
[04:23:04] <thebombzen> so in practice you wouldn't do that since it obfuscates
[04:23:04] <emanuele6> while a=$(something); [[ $a == *% ]]; do echo still ends with %; done
[04:23:12] <thebombzen> but inw hile you might
[04:23:16] <emanuele6> obfuscates what?
[04:23:34] <thebombzen> I meant, if you put the if statement before cmd1 instead of before cmd3 it seems to me like it reduces code readability for no gain
[04:23:41] <thebombzen> but I can see how it's valuable in a while statement
[04:24:02] <thebombzen> although, could you, in theory, join multiple statements together in a subshell?
[04:24:16] <thebombzen> like while ( foo; bar ) ; do baz; done
[04:24:26] <emanuele6> why a subshell?
[04:24:29] <emanuele6> just group them
[04:24:34] <kurahaupo> thebombzen: One case where I definitely would use a nontrivial list for "if" is: if cmd1 ; e=$?; ((e==0||e==17)); then …
[04:24:40] <thebombzen> or {} grouping
[04:25:12] <thebombzen> I just meant, if the language did not provide the ability to put multiple commands after a while, then you could still do it with something like: while { foo; bar; } ; do baz; done
[04:25:30] <edk> you could but it's a lot of syntax
[04:26:03] <thebombzen> it would allow you to eliminate "do" from the language tho, if one were redesigning the shellf or some reason
[04:26:12] <thebombzen> it was just a thought re: kurahaupo's statement about redesign
[04:28:10] <emanuele6> so you are proposing a syntax where: C's `while (func());' would be written as `while func; ; elihw' ?

[04:32:29] <thebombzen> while we're on the subject of readability, I find case statements to be particularly confusing
[04:33:05] <thebombzen> the ) without ( bothers me a lot
[04:33:19] <emanuele6> ( is optional
[04:33:44] <thebombzen> even if you *can* use ( the fact that you don't have to and most people don't does seem very counterintuitive to me
[04:34:11] <emanuele6> ok
[04:34:13] <kurahaupo> Recursive grammars are a compromise between precision and human language processing. Our innate linguistic abilities do not actually include recursion; that's something that takes a lot of training
[04:34:58] <kurahaupo> Originally the ( was not permitted so that's why it's still often not used
[04:34:59] <thebombzen> natural language can also be somewhat ambiguous and computer languages have to be designed in a way where syntactically unambiguous is important
[04:35:28] <thebombzen> consider the sentence "I read a guide about how to spot strangers on the internet" where it's not immediately clear whether the guide is on the internet or the strangers are on the internet
[04:36:02] <thebombzen> C has a similar problem with something like if (a) foo; if (b) bar; else baz;

[04:36:10] <emanuele6> fortunately, bash code is not abiguous if you know bash
[04:36:12] <kurahaupo> Sure. That's why I said that the language design is a comprise, to avoid such ambiguity
[04:36:13] <emanuele6> same for C
[04:36:52] <thebombzen> ye, it's a compromise
[04:37:13] <thebombzen> like you could always just define it to behave in a certain way. the C construct above always does the same thing
[04:37:38] *** Joins: n4dir (~user@i577BC902.versanet.de)
[04:38:12] <kurahaupo> One of the things that I dislike about C (and many other languages) is the lack of an explicit termination for control structures, so that you're obligated to use {} some of the time
[04:38:25] <thebombzen> I personally don't mind that
[04:38:49] <kurahaupo> (it was worse in Pascal; there you were obliged to write BEGIN and END instead of {})
[04:39:04] <thebombzen> what's your stance on the same word being used to end a block, btw? lua uses "end" for everything, but bash has "fi" "done" "esac" etc.
[04:39:12] <thebombzen> is one of them better than the other?
[04:39:24] <emanuele6> this is why GNU C code style is superior
[04:39:30] <kurahaupo> if/fi, case/esac, while/done - those are things of beauty to me
[04:39:43] <emanuele6> it makes it clear that { is not part of if's syntax
[04:40:00] <thebombzen> as far as I'm aware lua has "end" end every block because it makes it easier to optimize the size of the interpreter
[04:40:21] <thebombzen> not entirely sure about that but since the interpreter is optimized for size/speed it makes sense
[04:41:33] <kurahaupo> There's an ancient hack embedded in the shell where you can write for x in LIST; { … } without do+done, but we never mention it because it was deprecated in about 1980, is forbidden by POSIX, and doesn't work in all current shells

[05:21:41] <phogg> Whether the way Perl works actually decreases the amount of time you have to spend writing and/or debugging it is rather subjective, though.
[05:22:52] <kurahaupo> phogg: As a result, it's a language where you can be fantastically productive - after you've spent 5 years learning it
[05:23:17] <phogg> The major failing of Perl, if there can be said to have been one, was in object orientation. Objects are just funny looking hashrefs in reality, but requiring all users of the language to think about them like this was ultimately harmful.
[05:23:39] <n4dir> in that perl book i tried (and failed) it was quoted: "to every question, there is an easy answer. It is always wrong". Not saying it would suit for perl, but i sure like the quote a lot (a pity i forgot who said it)
[05:23:59] <phogg> This was improved in Raku where everything is still pretty much the same as everything else, but a metric ton of syntactic sugar makes it so it doesn't *seem* that way.
[05:24:46] <phogg> n4dir: It would very much the shell shell. There are a lot of easy answers, but they're not usually also correct answers.

[05:25:42] <n4dir> phogg: the very little i know about bash, close to nothing, makes it look like it.

[05:26:57] <phogg> n4dir: interestingly it would apply about as well to PHP, too. "Simpler ways are buggy." is how I like to say it.

[16:35:10] <tirnanog> so *.domain.tld is just a placeholder value then. fine.
[16:35:28] <PeGaSuS> and I need to trigger the script on a wildcard cert renewal
[16:36:05] <PeGaSuS> and certbot says this on renewal: Renewing an existing certificate for *.domain.tld
[16:36:08] <tirnanog> I see.
[16:37:34] <PeGaSuS> so, I expect it to trigger on something like '*.libera.chat'
[16:37:53] <tirnanog> as the script does not appear to take any arguments, you could do this: set -- 'user1@host1' 'user2@host2'
[16:38:04] <tirnanog> then for server; do ssh "$server" ...; done
[16:38:23] <tirnanog> that way, there would be no need to direct the user to copy and paste actual code.

[17:12:34] <node1> interprets what? and how?
[17:14:24] <tirnanog> by reading the input stream and parsing it in realtime using a grammar engine that is implemented with yacc, as far as I know.
[17:15:47] <PeGaSuS> stupid question: why "|| ! break" ?
[17:16:23] <tirnanog> it breaks the loop but negates the exit status value, in order for the script to exit 1 in that event.
[17:16:54] <tirnanog> because break always yields 0 unless it is employed incorrectly in its own right.

[17:26:41] <seninha> Is there anything faster than file(1) to check whether a file is plain text or binary? file(1) does a lot of guesses to check what kind of binary/plain text format the file is, so it is slow when running on a lot of files in a big directory.
