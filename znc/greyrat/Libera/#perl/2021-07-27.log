[14:55:55] <mst> YARLY
[14:56:32] <bliako> hi, i was wondering if there is an efficient way of extracting the contents of a Perl array (assume it contains only integers) from within an XS/Inline::C function  and place those integers into a C array.
[14:57:56] <LeoNerd> element at a time
[14:57:57] <LeoNerd> fo loop
[14:57:58] <mst> bliako: you need to pass it to a function that requires a C array?
[14:58:05] <LeoNerd> *for
[14:58:18] <bliako> I was thinking perhaps there is a data structure (provided by some Perl module) which facilitates that, i.e. it has an underlying C-array to hold its data and each Perl array element to point to that C-array
[14:58:46] <LeoNerd> I suspect overall that would be much slower because the perl-side accesses to it would be messy
[14:58:52] <mst> bliako: without you explaining what your actual goal is it's hard to give you advice here
[14:58:59] <bliako> LeoNerd, yes, for loop is what I do now, plust the overhead of malloc and free.
[14:59:06] <shlomif> bliako: vec/ perldl
[14:59:25] <bliako> mst, yes I need to pass some heavy matrices to C functions
[14:59:33] <bliako> via Inline::C
[14:59:55] <LeoNerd> You'll have to convert it. That sort of glue logic is exactly what this is all for
[15:00:07] <mst> what about converting it -once- to a C structure where the perl SV is just a blessed pointer, doing the various transforms, and then converting it back once
[15:00:21] <mst> that's how dataframe type stuff tends to work
[15:00:55] <bliako> mst, yes that's what I am looking for, anybody aware of anything already in CPAN?

[15:07:49] *** Joins: jadesoturi (~jadesotur@user/jadesoturi)
[15:08:07] <ilmari> when preforking one usually opens the listening socket in the parent process and has the children inherit it. that way the kernel will round-robin the incoming request between the accept() calls in the children
[15:09:21] <fuzzix> Which is why reuseport struck me as bad. The problem is, this isn't a real-world problem. The server *may* be CPU-bound, depending on what stupid demo I derive.

[16:18:59] <mst> bliako: that way you only do the conversion work right at the start and right at the end
[16:19:08] <mst> that way the cost is amortised
[16:19:22] <bliako> Botje, exactly reading that the time you posted!
[16:19:38] <mst> (which is basically how PDL does stuff, btw)
[16:19:49] <mst> (though it's a bit more clever / prettier)
[16:20:52] <bliako> mst, yep, got the idea. it's clear. I will read on PDL as well. For the time is the loop as you suggesrted
[16:21:30] <mst> point is the cost of the conversion is way less if you don't do it on every C call, basically
[16:21:41] <mst> everything else is details
[16:22:44] <bliako> yes, provided that i have several c-functions called. I am just working on a single matrix multiplication. But if for example I had to implement a neural network then your suggestion is well suited.
[16:23:39] <mst> if it's a single multiplication, you could always write the C code directly operating on the AVs
[16:24:15] <bliako> yep
[16:24:55] <bliako> though it's a bit more complex because I want to pass that to a CUDA kernel on the GPU. So there are 3 memory transfers Perl->C , C->GPU, GPU->C, C->Perl
[16:25:21] <bliako> 4 whatever

[16:30:09] <Botje> bliako: are you aware of perl's tie feature?
[16:30:50] <mst> Botje: if it's a single call and it's the conversion overhead that's the issue I'm not sure tie or even V::M would help amazingly?
[16:31:22] <LeoNerd> If you're after high performance, you didn't want tie()

[20:35:33] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Role::Basic - When you only want roles | Ovid [blogs.perl.org] ]
[20:35:41] <mst> this is eleven years ago
[20:35:52] <pragma-> Yeah, I'm a bit late to the party.
[20:36:08] <mst> oh, right, I wrote up a blog post
[20:36:09] <El_Che> "I'm on a new team at the BBC."
[20:36:43] <mst> though actually that blog post is more obsolete than anything ovid said
[20:36:49] <mst> cos I wrote Moo and Role::Tiny after that
[20:37:13] <pragma-> indeed. I almost started using Role::Basic but this channel steered me to Role::Tiny
[20:37:59] <pragma-> seems like Object::Pad will handle Roles going forward
[20:38:16] <thrig> Object::Roll::THAC0
[20:38:34] <mst> right, I'm tempted to write a babble transform that can convert Object::Pad code to something Moo/Role::Tiny can handle
[20:39:04] <El_Che> so, it's the idea that Object::Pad/core makes Moo obsolete?
[20:39:25] <pragma-> I have the mindset of preferring core, yes.
[20:39:37] <El_Che> checking with the Moo author

[20:39:43] <pragma-> Oho k
[20:41:10] <mst> El_Che: I am hoping that we will end up in a situation where "if you're in a situation where you -can- use Object::Pad (or core version thereof) you should just use that" is a reasonable default
[20:41:34] <mst> El_Che: as is the perl tradition, no guarantees as to which christmas, but that's where I'd like to be
[20:41:45] *** Joins: nirnam (~nirnam@1.46.138.159)
[20:42:03] <El_Che> mst: I mean Moo in maintenance mode once Christmas arrive instead of do a "challange accepted" and make it better than core again :)
[20:42:32] <Grinnz> El_Che: i think "there's literally no way to know at this juncture, we'll see"
[20:42:34] <mst> El_Che: part of Moo's raison d'etre was always to be minimal and pure perl
[20:42:51] <Grinnz> planning for obsolescence of systems that are incredibly widely used is how both the perl 6 and 7 discussions imploded
[20:42:54] <mst> El_Che: I don't see how I can make it 'better' than keyword plugin lovingly hand optimised XS in that regard

[20:43:28] <mst> El_Che: anyway, haarg's the one who does all the actual work these days so *shrug*
[20:43:48] <mst> hwat I'm thinking is using Babble to make it so you can have "Object::Pad::Or::Moo" type code
[20:43:49] <El_Che> Grinnz: all hypothetically/grain of salt, you get that, right?
[20:44:21] <Grinnz> sure, but i don't see the point in the hypothetical
[20:44:37] <mst> yeah, I'm not sure what the value is here
[20:45:06] <Grinnz> the hope is that Corinna will be the best Corinna it can be, and what happens to Moo(se) is entirely up to entropy
[20:45:09] <mst> would I be happy to see a day where I say "use Object::Pad over Moo for new code by default" ? cool
[20:45:27] <mst> do I need to see that? no
[20:45:57] <Grinnz> as far as intent, the intent is more "have something easier to show to newbies" than "have something to replace moo(se)"

[20:47:40] <mst> xenu: meh, no point having a snit about it
[20:48:08] <Grinnz> it always softens the blow when your neat thing being replaced is a pile of hack and vomit
[20:48:38] <pragma-> I don't know, I think I would be upset to know that my beautifully craft pile of hacks and vomit is being replaced by a half-assed pile of hacks and vimit.
[20:49:09] <pragma-> Oh, I misread that.
[20:49:17] <pragma-> I misread "is" as "by".
[20:49:22] <Grinnz> well, that happens too sometimes
[20:49:31] <Grinnz> not as nice though
[20:50:10] <mst> Grinnz: yeah, ok, Devel::Declare had the impressive property that Larry's first comment about it was "I knew there were seven ways for a compiler to lie to itself and I used all of them writing perl, but it appears you've found a new one"
