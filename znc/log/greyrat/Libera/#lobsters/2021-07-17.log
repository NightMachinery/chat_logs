[00:27:24] <rhn_mk1> just rhn, or rhn_mk1. I didn't create anything that took off, so it's no surprise you haven't heard of me

[00:28:14] <dmbaturin> Well, I mean I'm sort of active in the community, though not as much as I used to—but then the community is also quite a bit larger now.
[00:28:47] <rhn_mk1> do you mean the general IT/free software community, or lobsters?
[00:29:08] <dmbaturin> I mean the VyOS community. I don't think I've seen you in our forums or slack or IRC.
[00:29:19] <riv> @#lobsters: can you recommend any good films?
[00:29:32] <rhn_mk1> I think I sent one merge request and then didn't have time to follow up :X
[00:29:55] <dmbaturin> riv: X-ray film is great. Firm, durable, kinda nice to the touch (though hthat's subjective).
[00:30:15] <rhn_mk1> lately I've been wondering if porting to ARM64 is something interesting to VyOS, since I gained some experience with that lately
[00:30:22] <riv> :)
[00:30:59] <dmbaturin> rhn_mk1: What's the situation with bootloaders and device trees there? Is it getting standardized?
[00:31:09] <dmbaturin> We have #vyos here by the way.
[00:31:30] <rhn_mk1> there's EBBR which is taking off slowly, but it's mostly device-dependent still
[00:31:32] <dmbaturin> (Slack is much bigger... sadly.)
[00:31:56] <rhn_mk1> I've been eyeing the Turris Mox as a device that it might be worth the effort to build for

[00:41:01] <dimdima> every slack/discord i've joined, no one chats, people post questions no one answers
[00:41:14] <dimdima> dead basically, in one way or another
[00:41:22] <dmbaturin> Well, people do chat there, help one another... much like in the old IRC, before our audience somehow decided that Slack is better.
[00:41:37] <dimdima> they chat there?
[00:43:12] <rhn_mk1> the Bevy community seems to be rather lively, at least depending on the hour
[00:43:42] <dimdima> that's cool. i wouldn't mind chilling in happening slacks/discord
[00:44:05] <dimdima> though irc feels a lot less corporate/lame
[00:45:05] <technomancy> slack is supposedly designed for work
[00:45:25] <technomancy> so anyone using it for "chill out" chats is like ... yeah of course it doesn't work well for that. you're holding it wrong.
[00:46:25] <Xe> technomancy: do you use a pinephone?
[00:46:31] <technomancy> Xe: no, MNT Reform
[00:46:57] <technomancy> I can still do signal on my shitty android mobile but I have to plug in an external keyboard for anything nontrivial
[00:47:09] <technomancy> which mostly just means I don't talk to my friends as much
[00:47:12] <technomancy> (well, those friends anyway)
[00:47:17] <dimdima> never heard of that
[00:47:36] <dimdima> looks cool
[00:47:47] <dimdima> you use an MNT reform instead of a phone?
[00:47:50] <technomancy> no
[00:48:05] <technomancy> in some ways it's by far the best machine I've ever used and then in other ways it's extremely frustrating
[00:48:22] <technomancy> like the wifi range is about 40% of my thinkpad but the keyboard is leaps and bounds better

[01:04:49] <dmbaturin> rhn_mk1: I'm still thinking how to present such an example in a concise way. It's the page plus template (in SSG mode) plus config...

[01:05:46] <dmbaturin> Classic SSGs mostly piggyback on the familiarity of Jekyll, among SSG users anyway. I found the very concept of an SSG pretty hard to explain to people not already familiar with one.

[11:52:24] <bunnies> does anyone else have a problem where you always feel like an idea you have must be bad or misguided, because if it was actually a good idea it would already be popular?
[11:55:24] <bunnies> like ive been building a somewhat complex tool for managing my dotfiles and aliases and stuff, but then I see dotfiles from someone way more knowledgable than me and think my tool has to be unnecessary if this guy doesn't need something like it https://leahneukirchen.org/dotfiles/index.html
[11:56:19] <riv> im the opposite bunnies
[11:56:45] <riv> bunnies, she is actually on here!
[11:57:09] <riv> you could ask her opinion leah2
[11:58:01] <riv> but usually with ideas, I just feel like we are stuck in this 'worse is better swamp' and innovation is rarely even possible
[11:58:16] <riv> s/ swamp'/' swamp/
[11:58:34] <riv> because improvements dont get adopted
[12:01:02] <bunnies> sure i'll just link my thing i guess https://github.com/wwselleck/mew

[12:01:27] <riv> there's no description how it works? other than the code
[12:01:46] <bunnies> it's not particularly innovative or anything, it's just a node tool that lets me run commands like `mew install nvim` or `mew chrome openProfile` and I can define node files for each of those things
[12:02:03] <bunnies> yeah sorry, I'll actually update the README now
[12:02:31] <bunnies> but there's always this lingering feeling that I'm completely over-engineering the problem. and maybe I am idk.
[12:03:01] <riv> if you can do it simpler, do that
[12:03:01] <epilys> bunnies, you can try something more simple like shell scripting or python

[12:36:35] <riv> https://postimg.cc/d7KG7R4t dont know if site admins are bothered but i got this from going to "https://www.lobste.rs/domain/minimalmodeling.substack.com" via google
[12:36:50] <riv> at least I got that URL from copying it from my chromium address bar
[12:37:18] <riv> it hides the "www." that's a great useful feature
[12:38:13] <riv> ok substack is just medium
[12:38:23] <riv> but a lot of links from it got upvoted so I guess whatever
[12:39:49] <riv> *trying not to rant about it hiding www.*
[12:40:32] <bunnies> never heard of it, but it seems like a cool idea for an app
[12:40:43] <bunnies> it seems to be paid tho, so I'm not sure about sharing the articles on link aggregators
[12:41:33] <riv> for me personaly, I consistently dislike medium (and substack) articles
[12:41:44] <riv> but im just one person, seems like other people enjoy them
[12:43:46] <bunnies> the average medium article i stumble upon is like "here's 10 ways to log things in javascript" that's just regurgitating documentation
[12:44:01] <riv> hehe
[12:44:07] <bunnies> i also just think the way their formatted is ugly and too sparse. never read a substack article tho
[12:44:11] <riv> i need to set up a blog, i have something i want to write about
[12:44:21] <bunnies> i do just like the idea of cheap, but paid, content
[12:44:52] <bunnies> like I'd love to pay $5 for a stream of substantive programming articles on web dev or something like that
[12:44:55] <riv> I feel like the monitary factor causes low effort articles to be churned out though

[23:09:46] <rhn> oh, it's raw h2s
[23:09:59] <dmbaturin> rhn: Could you check the background issue now?
[23:10:01] <rhn> I was looking at markdown headers
[23:10:43] <rhn> dmbaturin: now it's readable
[23:11:06] <dmbaturin> I didn't set the body background indeed, good reminder.
[23:11:45] <dmbaturin> Ah, also another plugin automatically embeds the CSS and images from site/ into the page so that it's completely standalone.

[23:17:31] <dmbaturin> rhn: That one doesn't use metadata extraction though. The contenxt model (mapping of fields and selectors to look for in the page) is fully configurable: https://github.com/dmbaturin/soupault-website/blob/master/soupault.conf#L49-L71

[23:28:38] <dmbaturin> rhn: That was my main idea. The polar opposite of "opinionated". :)

[23:31:33] <rhn> maybe I'm philosophical, but everything surely is opinionated at some level of abstraction ;)
[23:32:06] <rhn> on the other hand, for example, make is much less opinionated than cargo, no matter how to look at it
