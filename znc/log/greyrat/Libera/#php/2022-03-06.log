[01:34:33] <jargon> Well, I decided to use CSS, not GD.
[01:34:57] <jargon> http://puzzlum.org/ How do I make the floppy disk z-order in front of the screenshot?
[01:35:17] <Blondie101010> hmmm, that's conceptually very different, and therefore sounds like GD was not the right tool for the job
[01:35:41] <Blondie101010> indeed, css is much more applicable for this
[01:35:56] <jargon> I need the screenshot to be inset inside the hole in the floppy disk.
[01:36:39] <Blondie101010> sure, plain CSS does that
[01:36:41] <jargon> And, I need to do so for all for games.
[01:36:47] <jargon> four*
[01:37:46] <jargon> such*
[01:37:55] <jargon> And, I need to do such for all four games. *
[01:39:18] <Blondie101010> now I'm not sure I follow exactly what output you're looking for...  if you want 2 images one over the other, then you put then inside a block and align them with css
[01:39:34] <Blondie101010> of course with the top one being transparent
[01:39:43] <Blondie101010> (background)
[01:39:46] <jargon> I need the screen shot to scale to the hole.
[01:39:59] <Blondie101010> what screenshot and what hole?
[01:40:25] <jargon> screenshot: http://puzzlum.org/gfx/gen/mr.png hole: http://puzzlum.org/gfx/gen/floppy%20overlay.png
[01:41:11] <Blondie101010> so you resize it with CSS, but it will be ugly
[01:41:59] <jargon> Before it can be pretty, like the duckling, it starts ugly. ;)
[01:42:17] <Blondie101010> well you can't really improve it much
[01:42:40] <Blondie101010> you're making any detail that could give it meaning invisible
[01:43:01] <jargon> I need to slap labels on the floppies.
[01:43:27] <Blondie101010> maybe if you only put the map it might be ok
[01:43:53] <Blondie101010> that cheat can also be handled in CSS
[01:51:01] <jargon> I want it to look like this: http://puzzlum.org/gfx/gen/demo.png
[01:51:43] <Blondie101010> ok so do it
[01:51:58] <jargon> I was forced to use GIMP. I want to use CSS.
[01:52:26] <Blondie101010> what part is complicated?
[01:52:37] <Blondie101010> look how to position and resize with CSS
[01:52:43] <jargon> I don't know how to stack scaled images. :(
[01:53:02] <Blondie101010> the z-index, which you already mentioned
[01:53:42] <Blondie101010> you put both images in the same div with different z-index
[01:53:53] <Blondie101010> then resize and reposition accordingly
[01:58:58] <jargon> http://puzzlum.org/ Did you look at this?
[01:59:51] <Blondie101010> yes but it's not clear what you want with it
[02:00:07] <Blondie101010> make a blank page to test it out
[02:00:17] <Blondie101010> it should take 10-15 minutes to get it roughly ok

[02:02:44] <jargon> Are you not able to see what I am seeing?
[02:02:49] <Blondie101010> SirLouen:  the most likely reason is that you haven't installed the relevant extension

[02:06:02] <Blondie101010> SirLouen:  so refer to the package manager you used to install php to know how to install the xdiff extension...  on centos 7 it is php-pecl-xdiff
[02:06:25] <SirLouen> Blondie101010 i was looking for this for debian
[02:07:01] <Blondie101010> so look into your package manager's documentation, examples or  tutorials
[02:07:22] <Blondie101010> I guess that searching "install php xdiff debian" should give it
[02:08:36] <Blondie101010> maybe not so obvious actually..  don't build it yourself

[02:10:19] <Blondie101010> yeah if your setup is clean, pecl should work

[08:04:04] <Rockwood> hi wp person :D
[08:04:39] <Rockwood> really my question belongs to why people need CMS?
[08:05:20] <tw2113> because not everyone wants to run builds or knows how to write valid HTML and compile and deploy things
[08:06:07] <Rockwood> are you sure they generates everything valid?
[08:06:26] <tw2113> the good tools would
[08:06:34] <Rockwood> hows?
[08:06:48] <Rockwood> you can't faith on junk code
[08:06:55] <Rockwood> as a developer
[08:07:10] <tw2113> and you can't even more on people who don't know what html even is
[08:07:24] <Rockwood> ah you can say this
[08:07:49] <tw2113> but give them a place to type in content, and handle like MS Word or similar, and you can give a lot of power pretty easy
[08:07:51] <Rockwood> but its not good solution seems to me
[08:09:47] <Rockwood> but i am happy still PHP holds huge place
[08:10:11] <Rockwood> now days website means php coded
[08:10:27] <Rockwood> others are very less
[08:10:46] <tw2113> but i heard static site generators were all the rage
[08:11:05] <Rockwood> means?
[08:11:50] <tw2113> sites that are html/css/js only
[08:12:04] <tw2113> but not yourself manually creating html files yourself
[08:12:33] <Rockwood> its only frontend stuff

[08:44:49] <Rockwood> yeah that is
[08:45:03] <tw2113> we're hiring right now https://webdevstudios.com/careers/
[08:45:23] <Rockwood> only WP devs?
[08:45:41] <tw2113> we're doing a lot with react/nextjs as well
[08:45:44] <Blondie101010> please keep job offer/requests for another channel

[19:02:38] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[19:06:33] <AllenJB> By coding styles I assume you mean code formatting - eg. PSR-1/2/12. That should mostly be handled by your editor / IDE.
[19:06:34] <AllenJB>  I would look at SOLID / object calisthenics / clean code, then move on to design patterns (some of which you'll learn anyway doing the former)
[19:07:16] <arash> AllenJB, yes. formatting.

[19:46:38] <teresko> arash: I would focus on SOLID, and also take a look at "Separation of Concerns" and "Law of Demeter"
[19:47:36] <teresko> design patterns are more of shorthands for describing the code - they are useful to know, but in long term they are NOT to be treated as magicla blueprints
[19:48:27] <teresko> you also migth want to looks at learning SQL and or JS, since a lot of developer suck at those two (no, copypasting snippets of jquery does not mean you know JS)

[21:10:34] <da_wunder> I would ask following - "Am I using Windows to host my production site?"
[21:11:48] <Roelof> da_wunder  this is for learning and doing challenges so It never goes to a production site
[21:12:03] <AllenJB> Unless you know your site is going to be hosted on Windows, I'd recommend using *nix (inc. OSX, Linux and WSL2). The main differences are in posix / process stuff and filesystem (including ownership and permissions).
[21:12:07] <Roelof> maybe later wordpress could make it to a production site
[21:12:37] <Merwede> There is no benefit to not using WSL2. It's really easy to use once you get it set up correctly.
[21:12:41] <Roelof> and do someone know a good free course to learn php
[21:13:13] <da_wunder> Merwede: sadly that IO performance with wsl2 is still quite bad
[21:13:14] <AllenJB> The vast majority of websites are hosted on *nix and knowledge of how to work with its filesystem and permissions system will be useful to you

[21:37:46] <velix> I'm sending a generated JSON text using "Transfer-Encoding: chunked". Can I simply echo() it or do I need ob_flush(); ?
[21:38:01] <velix> I actually never needed ob_ and flush(). But some tutorials recommend it.
[21:38:35] <Naktibalda> you need it if you used ob_start(); or if you have output_buffering.auto_start enabled in php.ini
[21:39:45] <velix> Naktibalda: let me check default setting.
[21:40:00] <velix> Naktibalda: But should I use it?
[21:40:47] <Naktibalda> only if you have some difficulties.
[21:41:15] <Naktibalda> to make things worse there can be multiple levels of output buffers and you have to flush or close them all
[21:42:02] <velix> Oh, I need to end "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" by \r\n
[21:42:44] <TinoDidriksen> Why do you set a Transfer-Encoding at all? Let the HTTP daemon figure it out.
[21:42:53] <velix> TinoDidriksen: Oh? I thought it's polite.
[21:42:55] <velix> Okay, removed again ;)
[21:43:20] <velix> I'm just sending Content-Length with mb_string() now.
[21:43:21] <velix> Thanks!
[21:44:16] <Naktibalda> what is the mb_string() and what has it got to do with content0length?
[21:44:28] <Naktibalda> I think that content-length should be in bytes
[21:44:56] <__adrian> you can specify (though ni don't think "characters" is a valid or useful unit of measure)
[21:45:32] <da_wunder> imho, the most important part is to set `Content-Type: application/json` header to that response
[21:45:34] <__adrian> also why are you sending in chunks if you know how long the body is?
[21:47:40] <da_wunder> also not really sure what is the benefit to send json response in chunks - you would need to use json_encode which will return you that full json string, and then you need to split that to chunks and so on
[21:52:01] <velix> Sorry, frontend guy was on the phone
[21:52:09] <velix> Naktibalda: mb_strlen().
[21:52:39] <velix> __adrian: I'm no more sending in chucks
[21:52:41] <velix> chunks*
[21:52:52] <__adrian> right, but why were you
[21:53:34] <__adrian> da_wunder: even though it's againsnt spec, there are "streaming" parsers that allow for that to better support huge amounts of data
[21:53:44] <velix> __adrian: old code.

[23:19:13] <Blondie101010> in general, learning programming or a language depends on your current knowledge
[23:19:36] <Roelof> I was looking at this one : https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-applications-php?ranMID=40328&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-4dOneOvySHsdGCofX4o8hw&siteID=JVFxdTr9V80-4dOneOvySHsdGCofX4o8hw&utm_content=10&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=JVFxdTr9V80#syllabus
[23:19:48] <Roelof> I know some html, css and ruby
[23:21:01] <Blondie101010> well it looks like it could provide more than a good overview of the process, but I couldn
[23:21:08] <Blondie101010> *couldn't evaluate its content
[23:21:23] <Blondie101010> since it's free, you have nothing much to lose beyond your time
[23:22:18] <Blondie101010> hmmm, that's not free though
[23:22:23] <Blondie101010> just a 7 day trial
[23:24:12] <Roelof> are you sure , I see buttons which says enroll for free
[23:24:26] <Roelof> cannot iind that is it is 7 day trial

[23:28:52] <Roelof> Sorry, still cannot find that on the page
[23:29:02] <Roelof> even with the search option
[23:30:24] <Blondie101010> identify yourself
[23:30:47] <Blondie101010> I clicked something like login through facebook
[23:32:27] <Blondie101010> the fact that I can't see the price and it shows they have "Financial aid available" implies it's expensive :)

[23:47:29] <Alexander-47u> hi guys
[23:47:34] <Alexander-47u> my array wont sort, its driving me crazy
[23:47:35] <Alexander-47u> https://pastebin.com/XBxWekJ7
[23:48:34] <da_wunder> Alexander-47u: please share "working" example in 3v4l.org site of your code
[23:49:15] <Alexander-47u> my question is simple
[23:49:20] <Alexander-47u> what do I use to sort the shown array
[23:49:27] <Alexander-47u> sort($array); doesnt work
[23:49:37] *** Joins: Alex8532 (~Alex8532@user/alex8532)
[23:51:22] <da_wunder> so what do you expect to get - that is why I recommend you to use that 3v4l.org site, so that we could actually see _what_ you're doing
[23:52:22] <Alexander-47u> could you please click on the pastbin link, you will understand :D da_wunder
[23:52:50] <Alexander-47u> I need the array sorted by date
[23:53:23] <da_wunder> Alexander-47u: could you please make a working example what you're doing like - https://3v4l.org/C5DDr
[23:55:14] <da_wunder> Alexander-47u: in your pastebin link - I don't know what you're trying to do - it just shows a var_dump output of some array - that won't tell us what you're trying to do
[23:56:05] <da_wunder> Alexander-47u: I created that 3v4l.org example from your pastebin - and just use that `sort` function - and that is my best guess what you're looking for - but cannot be sure
[23:56:18] <Alexander-47u> thank you
[23:56:23] <Alexander-47u> but for some reason it doesnt work
[23:56:46] <da_wunder> it sure works in that 3v4l.org example - try to understand that we don't see your screen
[23:57:11] <da_wunder> that is why asked you to share _your_ code in 3v4l.org site, so that we could actually see what _you're_ doing
[23:57:25] <Alexander-47u> yes, I see youre example works perfectly
[23:57:35] <Alexander-47u> but im doing the same thing and for some reason its simply not sorting O_O
[23:57:52] <da_wunder> without that it's just big guessing game - and literally no point to continue this without proper input from your side
[23:58:05] <da_wunder> so fuck sake - share your code...
[23:58:12] <da_wunder> how fucking hard could it be?
[23:58:21] <Alexander-47u> you wont be able to run it
[23:58:29] <Alexander-47u> from within the website
[23:58:38] <da_wunder> so create simple example to show that issue
[23:58:49] <Alexander-47u> you already did buddy :), thanks
[23:58:55] <Alexander-47u> I need to find wtf is going on
[23:59:30] <da_wunder> and fourth time - sharing that code would help us to solve that issue...
