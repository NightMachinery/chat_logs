[17:53:49] <ngz> You can control that.
[17:54:03] <alice[m]> whereas i'd assume org-latex-logfiles-extensions would trigger the deletion of all pdfs (if i add pdf to the list)

[17:54:14] <ngz> For example, you could create sub-directories containing the PDF not produced by Org.
[17:55:04] <alice[m]> hm, sure, but i may want to have a pdf around in the local folder, and i suppose org-latex-logfiles-extensions would cause its deletion
[17:56:11] <ngz> Certainly. I don't see a reason to have a pdf around though. Of course, that's just me.
[17:56:46] <alice[m]> yeah, i'm probably overcomplicating things :)
[17:57:07] <alice[m]> i think i've everything i need to finalise my pipeline now
