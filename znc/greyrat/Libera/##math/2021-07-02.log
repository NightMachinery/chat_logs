[01:44:45] <biberao> im trying to get what it means
[01:44:57] <rex> Is there an ⇔ between the two?
[01:45:05] <biberao> ya
[01:45:40] <rex> ok then it means that, two cosines are equal if and only if one is the other plus some integer multiple of 2π
[01:46:14] <rex> although that's not completely true
[01:46:39] <biberao> maybe
[01:46:46] <biberao> its the reduction to the first quadrant
[01:47:23] <rex> well if x = α + 2kπ then cos x = cos α
[01:47:43] <rex> that part is just the periodicity of cosine

[02:11:38] <biberao> it was bad of me haha

[06:27:55] <cherim_> T in the example above?
[06:27:56] <laurus> cherim_: Well, G is a transformation that takes e_1 to v_1 and e_2 to v_2
[06:28:08] <laurus> No, T is a linear transformation on X

[06:28:12] <laurus> G is an isomorphism that just changes bases
[06:28:18] <laurus> Sorry if I wasn't clear about that
[06:28:28] <laurus> The matrix of the isomorphism is a matrix representing G
[06:28:40] <cherim_> T was an isomorphism that changed the basis above as well
[06:28:54] <cherim_> Its matrix is not necessarily identity
[06:29:08] <laurus> cherim_: I didn't imagine T was an isomorphism, I just thought of it as a linear transformation
[06:29:21] <cherim_> What's the difference?
[06:29:31] <laurus> cherim_: Not all linear transformations are invertible
[06:29:41] <cherim_> Changes of bases are
[06:29:50] <laurus> cherim_: Right, so I'm talking about two different things here
[06:29:57] <laurus> I'm trying to write something like A = PBP^{-1}
[06:30:31] <cherim_> Then matrix P will have the coordinates of eigenvectors of B in the original basis as entries
[06:30:43] <cherim_> It's not identity
[06:32:16] *** Joins: Panther (Lord@2601:18a:c000:5290:c586:7821:5b8d:5974)
[06:32:16] <cherim_> You can do one example explicitly, say B=(2 1 // 1 2)
[06:32:28] <cherim_> I am not sure what the paradox is for you
[06:33:21] <laurus> cherim_: So if Ge_1 = v_1, Ge_2 = v_2,  v_[G]_e = (Ge_1, Ge_2)_v = ((v_1)_v , (v_2)_v) which is the identity
[06:33:40] *** Quits: CombatVet (~c4@user/combatvet) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[06:33:56] <laurus> I don't know how to write this notation properly, v_[G]_e is the matrix representation of G with "e" being the "from" basis and "v's" being the "to" basis
[06:34:09] <laurus> A subscript "v" means coordinates with respect to (v_1, v_2)
[06:34:18] <laurus> A subscript "e" means coordinates with respect to (e_1, e_2)
[06:34:32] <cherim_> Let's go over B=(2 1 // 1 2)
[06:34:33] *** Quits: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:34:45] <laurus> Hang on, how do I just represent G as a matrix?
[06:34:46] <cherim_> It has eigenvalues 3 and 1
[06:34:53] <laurus> I have G e_1 = v_1 and G e_2 = v_2
[06:35:01] <cherim_> Corresponding to eigenvectors (1, 1) and (1, -1)
[06:35:33] <cherim_> So your map P should take e1=(1, 0) to v1=(1, 1) and e2=(0, 1) to v2=(1, -1)
[06:35:53] <cherim_> So P= (1 1 // 1 -1)
[06:35:54] <laurus> Well, wait a minute, you're saying [v_1]_e = (1, 1), right?
[06:36:03] <laurus> v_1 represented in the standard basis is (1, 1)

[06:36:17] <cherim_> Then represent e1 in that basis too
[06:36:24] <laurus> So (Ge_1)_e = (v_1)_e = (1, 1)
[06:36:32] *** Quits: tacegory (~tacegory@user/tacegory) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:36:44] <cherim_> You can't use one basis for e1 and e2 and another for v1 and v2
[06:37:08] <cherim_> We started with this, you have an identification of X and Y
[06:37:22] <laurus> cherim_: I'm completely confused about how these matrix representations are mixing the "to" and the "from" bases
[06:37:25] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@136.185.148.86)
[06:37:36] <laurus> Like, it seems that a matrix or vector can only be written in a single basis.
[06:38:03] <cherim_> If your operator maps X->X, you have one basis (in X) and it determines elntries of X completely
[06:38:23] *** Joins: CombatVet (~c4@user/combatvet)
[06:38:24] <cherim_> Your transformation P acts X->X
[06:38:41] <laurus> Okay, so for a change of basis, I pick only the "to" basis and represent everything in that form?
[06:39:02] <cherim_> Or "from". In one case you get P, in another P^{-1}
[06:39:20] <cherim_> See the example for P above again
[06:39:34] <cherim_> There everything was in (e1, e2) basis
[06:39:43] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[06:40:07] <laurus> Right, so for Ge_1 = v_1, G e_2 = v_2, I pick the standard basis and get (v_1, v_2)_e = ((v_1)_e, (v_2)_e) = (1 1 // 1 -1). That makes sense.
[06:40:20] *** Quits: bosspotato_ (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[06:40:32] <cherim_> Yes
[06:40:39] <laurus> How do I know that the columns of the change of basis matrix should be Ge_1 and Ge_2 in the first place thoughg?
[06:40:43] <laurus> *though, sorry
[06:41:37] <laurus> Or is it just, this is how it goes for any linear transformation?
[06:41:57] <cherim_> You want P^{-1} B P = diag(lambda_1, lambda_2)
[06:42:11] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@136.185.148.86) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[06:42:19] <cherim_> Equivalently, BP=Pdiag(lambda_1, lambda_2))
[06:42:25] <laurus> Right
[06:42:40] <cherim_> Look at this one column of P (on the right) at a time
[06:42:59] <laurus> I see now that the columns are _always_ in terms of the "to" basis
[06:43:12] <laurus> And the numbers sometimes change if one changes the "from" basis
[06:43:58] <cherim_> If the first column of P is p1 (as a vector), Bp1 = lambda_1 p1
[06:44:08] <laurus> Right.
[06:44:11] <cherim_> So p1 is the eigenvector corresponding to lambda 1, etc.
[06:44:18] <laurus> I think I understand now how this works in general

[12:11:11] <brownorange> if it was all really a blunder to uncritically accept axioms, then it seems to me you'd have to believe the circularity both did and didn't exist
[12:11:33] <brownorange> my understanding is axioms literally are what they grant you in terms of provability. if there was funny business, you'd know it
[12:13:06] <riv> I think that the statement "There are true things we cannot prove" is (A) obviously true as an informal statement.. we only have 90 years or so (B) has to be rejected as a formal logic statement

[12:13:51] <riv> because in (B) it can't be unfolded into a rigorous statement, we just have an informal argument about the godel sentence being "true". this isn't rigorous and it actually hides what's really true

[15:07:17] <quarterback> I know that this is some effort for trivial mathematical problems. I am trying to remember all derivatives and integrals . I have a chart of these .
[15:08:53] <PlanckWalk> I prefer to write it as  sinh cosh^-5,  and note that cosh' = sinh

[15:09:46] <PlanckWalk> The only annoying bit is dealing with the constants
[15:09:53] <quarterback> Yes
[15:10:09] <PlanckWalk> It's going to be  (some constant) u^-4

[15:43:07] <tempate99> Numbers are just concepts from human thought; there are no numbers without humans. I recommend reading Borges's Funes short-story. It's about a guy who doesn't understand that you can give names to all numbers without knowing what they will be (you don't learn the name of 141, you just reason out it's one hundred forty one), so he gives proper
[15:43:08] <tempate99> names to each of them up until 24000, I believe.
[15:43:18] <rubiksdream> tempate99 if it was algebraic, then there would be a polynomial in R[x,y] whose zero set contains it, i.e. there would be a polynomial in C[x,y] whose zero set contains it, call this P. Now V(P) \cap {y = 0} is infinite, so by the nullstellensatz, y and P have a common component, i.e. y | P (since it is irreducible in C[x,y]), but then {y = 0} \subset V(P) for any poly P whose zero set contains {(x,sinx) : x \in R}, which shows it cannot be
[15:43:18] <rubiksdream> algebraic
[15:43:33] <tempate99> In any case, it's more of a topic for ##philosophy-uncensored than for ##math.

[15:49:08] <rubiksdream> im really working in the projective plane in the argument
[15:49:19] <rubiksdream> and assuming P is homogeneous
[15:49:25] <rubiksdream> but it still works
[15:49:36] <rubiksdream> it wont be easy to explain why the argument works if you don't know about bezouts theorem
[15:50:48] <rubiksdream> but the main idea is, if {(x,sinx)} is algebraic, its contained in the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial in three variables [x,y,z], and since it intersects {y = 0} infinitely often, y | P, so the zero set of P contains {y = 0}
[15:51:27] <rubiksdream> what that means is, if {(x,sinx)} = V(P_1) \cap ... \cap V(P_k) (which is exactly what it means to be algebraic), {(x,sinx)} contains {y = 0}
[15:51:31] <rubiksdream> and that is obviously not true
[15:52:06] <tempate99> Hmmm
[15:52:15] <tempate99> Alright, I think I get it now
[15:52:44] <rubiksdream> actually sorry, maybe we can do this with no bezouts theorem and just an elementary argument
[15:52:47] <rubiksdream> yes i think we can
[15:52:48] <rubiksdream> just a sec
[15:52:57] <tempate99> I read this online: https://imgur.com/a/UJ6wQ6A
[15:53:32] <tempate99> but I have no idea what the x - c line has to do with anything
[15:55:22] <rubiksdream> so, assume {(x,sinx)} is algebraic, that is {(x,sinx)} = V(P_1)\cap ... \cap V(P_k) for polynomials P_j \in R[x,y]. Now this means in particular, {(x,sinx)} \subset V(P_j) for any j , and {y = 0} \cap V(P_j) is infinite for any j. Write P_j = y*Q_j + U(x) , (division with remainder), then P_j(x,0) = U(x) has infinitely many roots, so U(x) = 0. Thus y | P_j for any j
[15:55:40] <rubiksdream> thus V(P_j) all contain {y=0}, and {(x,sinx)} contains {y=0}
[15:55:50] <rubiksdream> this is a contradiction, since {(x,sinx)} does not in fact, contain {y=0}
[15:55:58] <rubiksdream> this is a totally elementary argument, see if it makes sense to you
[15:57:28] <rubiksdream> oh okay, yes so they've done the same thing I have
[15:57:45] <rubiksdream> basically P_j(x,0) is a polynomial in one variable with infinitely many roots
[15:57:54] <rubiksdream> and that is impossible unless P_j(x,0) = 0, which occurs iff y | P_j
[15:58:19] <rubiksdream> they've just done it with c in place of 0 , because the same argument works with any -1<=c<=1 and {y = c} rather than {y = 0}
[15:58:20] <tempate99> I don't understand the y | P_j part

[15:59:06] *** Quits: qbt (~edun@user/edun) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[15:59:16] <rubiksdream> so P_j(x,0) = c_0(x) has infinitely many roots

[15:59:31] <rubiksdream> that means c_0(x) is the zero polynomial
[15:59:48] <tempate99> Following you so far
[15:59:52] <rubiksdream> so P_j = c_1(x)y + ... + c_d(x)y^d = y(c_1(x) + ...  + c_d(x)y^{d-1})

[16:02:47] <rubiksdream> hence {y = 0} \subset {(x,sinx)}
[16:02:48] <rubiksdream> which is false

I know I often find myself lost with mathematical notation—not that it's something that can't be understood but that I don't have an intuitive understand of it and can't continue. I believe that is currently my biggest limiting factor in my growth with

[19:59:22] <Cyp_> [17:18:16] <ALowther_> mathematics. Are there any resources that you would recommend that would allow me to quickly run through refreshers to make sure I have the foundations and then would allow me to slow down and take a deeper dive once I reached concepts that I needed more time with?
[19:59:34] <ALowther> Cyp_: thank you!!!!
[20:02:28] <ALowther> More condensed: I find myself getting lost in higher maths, not due to my inability to understand the concepts, but by not understanding the language through which it is expressed. I'd like to get familiar with the language so that I can enjoy the conversations and discoveries that are happening.
[20:03:23] <Z-module> It's hard to give a general-purpose answer to that. What's a "typical" math notation you find confusing?

[20:11:43] <Z-module> It omits some important topics and thus some really important proof methods (I'm thinking of group actions here), but for the scope it has, it's a truly magnificent book.

[22:57:48] <[itchyjunk]> I should try to learn more about turing machines and such too
[22:58:00] <riv> do you know the halting problem?
[22:58:58] <[itchyjunk]> This is the one where you have an oracle that can tell if a program ever halts or not. but when you feed an oracle as a program to the oracle, you get a contradiction
[22:59:02] <[itchyjunk]> i think something like that?

[23:00:20] <riv> sort of
[23:00:31] <riv> you shouldn't worry about oracles yet
[23:01:29] <[itchyjunk]> Ah so halting problem is wether or not you can decide if a program terminates
[23:02:04] <riv> yeah, just with normal programming
[23:02:08] <riv> but it's impossible
[23:02:29] <riv> (to write code that will always successfully determine halting on all inputs)
[23:03:04] <hanif> imagine a world where we could solve the halting problem, how much different would it be?
[23:03:35] <hanif> i wonder if there's already some sci-fi addressing it

[23:03:42] <riv> that would so cool, I want to read that
[23:04:21] <[itchyjunk]> Nothing would change? I've never had to decide wether something terminates or not
[23:04:24] <hanif> i mean, you get a new halting problem, but still there's so much extra stuff you could compute
[23:04:35] <[itchyjunk]> At worse case, just add break; or sometihng to break out of a loop :s

[23:07:00] <hanif> primality testing would become O(1) (run oracle on (if prime, loop indefinitely, otherwise halt)). how much faster could you get factorisation?
[23:07:40] <johnkeats6> ? if you could solve the halting problem everything would be trivial
[23:07:47] <hanif> O(log(N))?
[23:07:48] <johnkeats6> primality testing would be the least of your concerns..
[23:08:15] <hanif> say for encryption
[23:08:28] <johnkeats6> you could immediately settle every mathematical question (the program searches through all possible proofs and halts iff it finds one)
[23:08:29] <riv> you could check any mathematical fact if it were true or not
[23:09:05] <hanif> ah yes of course :)
[23:09:55] <johnkeats6> (at least the question of whether that statement or its negation follows from some formal computable axiomatic system)

[23:11:27] <[itchyjunk]> Oh "if prime" is a valid thing to ask?
[23:11:31] <hanif> you might also get the proof of a true statement in O(N) where N is the length of the shortest proof
[23:11:41] <hanif> maybe faster even

[23:35:02] <harwiltz> tusko: That looks pretty good to me. Maybe just add a final comment pointing out that the inequality holds since k+1 is nonnegative? Also, it would probably read better if it was more constructive (not sure if this is the right word), but for example, if you start with the LHS expression and directly show that the inductive hypothesis is true, without doing algebra on both sides. But that's a matter
[23:35:04] <harwiltz> of preference I suppose.
[23:36:59] <tusko> harwiltz, That was the problem my prof pointed out is that I was working both sides. I have tried to avoid it here, but I think maybe I'm not getting the point there
[23:37:52] <harwiltz> tusko: It's really a minor thing. Basically, completely "forget" about the RHS and just work with the LHS until you get the inequality you want.
[23:41:49] <harwiltz> In your case, you say "observe that *stuff* <= 1 + k/(k+1)". Instead of this, start with *stuff* and do algebra on it until you get an expression that is clearly <= 1 + k/(k+1). So the last step in your work would be *simple stuff* <= 1 + k/(k+1).

[23:45:04] <harwiltz> What I like about this approach is that I'm led directly to the claim of the proof. In your proof, I'm led to *some polynomial* <= *some other polynomial*, which isn't really a big deal since this is a short proof. But imagine if it was a really complex proof, I might agree with the statement about those polynomials, but by then I've forgotten what I'm trying to prove! ;)
