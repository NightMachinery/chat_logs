[00:10:36] <ButterNoodle> will there be tail hair around the tail hole?

[00:10:50] <mixfix41> uh huh
[00:10:55] <ButterNoodle> nice
[00:11:21] <Roey> No doubt--Holo the Wise Wolf was a nice introduction for many folks to furry fandom
[00:11:30] <mixfix41> i message the thread so i dont lose it
[00:11:34] <ButterNoodle> *not furry
[00:11:40] <mixfix41> i almost had a breakdown not finding it :D
[00:11:44] <ButterNoodle> thats what I tell myself
[00:11:52] <TsundereNoises> She's not a furry, just just has a fluffy tail and cute ears
[00:11:53] <Roey> lol
[00:12:00] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: and is 13
[00:12:04] <TsundereNoises> nothing wrong with liking a nice fluffy tail
[00:12:09] <Roey> she's a Level I furry
[00:12:16] <Roey> TsundereNoises: right, and wolf ears.
[00:12:37] <ButterNoodle> if the furry thing is the only thing we take objection to here.. I'm good w that ##anime
[00:12:37] <TsundereNoises> you can't have a furry slippery slope
[00:12:43] <TsundereNoises> the hair adds too much friction
[00:12:56] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: properly lube first pls
[00:13:06] <Roey> omg, I made that up... and then in searching for that term, found it exactly as how I described it: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/furry-scale

[00:13:54] <TsundereNoises> Roey: but as you see, animal ears do not a furry make
[00:13:56] <ButterNoodle> is that the "I'd fuck all of em" one?
[00:14:35] <Roey> TsundereNoises: lol heh
[00:14:43] <Roey> whatever tho.  I want my own Holo.

[00:16:00] <TsundereNoises> Holo was cute, but I've moved on to a new facking cute wolf these days

[00:17:12] <TsundereNoises> YES fellow Asuka appreciator
[00:17:21] <TsundereNoises> did you know that TO THIS DAY there are still people who think Rei was best girl?
[00:17:23] <TsundereNoises> heathens
[00:17:37] <Roey> I was gonna say the exact same thing
[00:17:46] <Roey> I mean, Asuka is the definition of tsundere
[00:17:53] <Roey> and also Haruhi Suzumiya.
[00:17:58] <Roey> but Asuka's less annoying
[00:18:12] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I admit I like Nagato (i.e. Haruhi Rei) best
[00:18:14] <TsundereNoises> I'm a hypocrit
[00:18:18] <Roey> haha :)
[00:18:20] <Roey> she's so weird.
[00:18:28] <Roey> she's not a robot, right?
[00:18:30] <Roey> or is she?
[00:18:32] <Roey> nagato i mean
[00:19:10] <TsundereNoises> she's an artificial person created by some advanced AI or something like that
[00:19:15] <TsundereNoises> so I think TECHNICALLY is not a robot
[00:19:23] <ButterNoodle> except in the spinoff TsundereNoises
[00:19:27] <ButterNoodle> she's a real girl
[00:19:38] <TsundereNoises> the spinoff was the most disappointing thing of that year
[00:19:49] <Roey> oh I suppose Nagati is  a clone of Rei Ayanami
[00:19:50] <TsundereNoises> but I watched it all and I got a bit emotional at some points
[00:19:52] <ButterNoodle> it was? I thought mayoiga was
[00:20:25] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: Mayoiga wasn't disappointing at all, it was a much worse show but who would have expected anything from it?
[00:20:29] <TsundereNoises> it was a clusterfuck from the start
[00:20:33] <ButterNoodle> tru
[00:20:38] <ButterNoodle> maybe I had high hopes...
[00:20:38] <Roey> I got stuck at the Endless Eights episodes.
[00:20:40] <TsundereNoises> also the hippopotomasu song was great
[00:20:41] <Roey> stopped watchin
[00:21:07] <Roey> <TsundereNoises> she's an artificial person created by some advanced AI or something like that
[00:21:07] <Roey> <TsundereNoises> so I think TECHNICALLY is not a robot <- yeah thanks for that explanation
[00:21:20] * TsundereNoises has watched all of endless eight like 5 times at this point
[00:21:24] <Roey> :) :) : )
[00:21:29] <TsundereNoises> it is important to suffer as Nagato did
[00:21:37] <Roey> ya know what's weird. I've /had/ dreams before where it's like Closed Space
[00:21:45] <Roey> where it's night time and there's no one there

[00:24:10] <Roey> aye
[00:24:18] <TsundereNoises> although I think it was different in the anime and the LN for some fun reason like the big number sounded better out loud that they used in the anime
[00:24:26] <Roey> also, what is your take on beach episodes
[00:24:34] <Roey> ok
[00:24:43] <TsundereNoises> what about beach episodes?
[00:24:45] <Roey> what's LN
[00:24:52] <Roey> TsundereNoises: like when everyone goes to the beach
[00:24:55] <Roey> sometimes it is a clip show
[00:25:03] <Roey> do you think it is filler?
[00:25:10] <TsundereNoises> "light novel" a book in japanese that has like 5 illustrations in it, which is how Haruhi was published
[00:25:17] <Roey> oh, got it
[00:25:18] <TsundereNoises> and most anime that were adapted from books rather than manga
[00:26:12] <TsundereNoises> they're cheap paperbacks, tend to be easier reading level, are targetted at a younger/nerdier demographic
[00:26:22] <TsundereNoises> and although some as good, they have a bad rep because a lot of shit gets published as LNs
[00:27:08] <TsundereNoises> Roey: it depends on the show! You CAN make a filler beach episode, but sometimes a beach episode, even one that has all the standard tropes, can be one of the best episodes of the show
[00:27:19] <TsundereNoises> Yuru Yuri for example has a great beach episode
[00:27:26] <Roey> hmm mok
[00:27:27] <TsundereNoises> Non Non Biyori basically has a beach episode movie
[00:27:46] <Roey> that sounds like an indian cuisine dish to me
[00:27:57] <TsundereNoises> if the characters just randomly go to a beach in the middle, that can be an excuse to be lazy I guess, but it doesn't HAVE to be
[00:28:00] <Roey> that's trying to reassure customers that it's vegan

[00:28:23] <Roey> TsundereNoises: I mean look, haruhi and chobits both did beach eps
[00:28:36] <TsundereNoises> I think it's maybe useful to think about what you mean by filler
[00:29:01] <Roey> Vampire Hunter Z should have done a beach ep.  Well.  No.  They only had like one or two female characters.
[00:29:04] <Roey> or hmm. Death Note?
[00:29:09] <TsundereNoises> if there's some ongoing plot and the episode is just wasting time while the manga catches up or something, like a lot of shounen anime, that's filler
[00:29:21] <Roey> TsundereNoises: filler = no interesting new material that builds up characters or story
[00:29:44] <TsundereNoises> Roey: I'd disagree with that definition!
[00:29:54] <TsundereNoises> Roey: like if something is a fluffy comedy kind of show, is a beach episode filler?
[00:30:06] <TsundereNoises> if there's no real ongoing plot and the beach episode has as many jokes as any other episode?

[00:30:42] <emmeka> even then, it's sometimes fine. look at Sailor Moon. it has a beach episode, I think it even has several, but Sailor Moon is literally 90% filler and that's essentially the substance of the show, so it's fine
[00:30:46] <TsundereNoises> and sometimes a beach (or onsen or whatever) episode CAN have big character development, or can be needed for pacing
[00:31:03] <TsundereNoises> like the onsen episode in Gurren Lagann for example, I think that's a great episode, not filler
[00:31:06] <Roey> TsundereNoises:  if there's some ongoing plot and the episode is just wasting time while the manga catches up or something <- yeah that's something to consider, agreed
[00:31:11] <JesseDesu> !t onsen
[00:31:12] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: Hot spring
[00:31:15] <TsundereNoises> it's silly, but it helps lighten the mood and gives a bit of a plot break
[00:31:30] <Roey> emmeka: regarding Sailor Moon as being 90% filler, that's how I view Bleach and especially Naruto
[00:31:59] <Roey> TsundereNoises: thanks for hte Gurren Lagann beach episode reference, will take a look at that
[00:32:20] <TsundereNoises> Roey: I mean, you should definitely watch Gurren Lagann, not just for the onsen episode
[00:32:30] <TsundereNoises> it does have an actual plot
[00:32:34] <TsundereNoises> also lots of drills
[00:33:18] <Roey> heh ok
[00:33:43] <Roey> whoah this was produced by Konami??
[00:33:49] <emmeka> drills that will pierce the heavens, even
[00:34:09] <emmeka> Roey Gurren Lagann is by the same folks that made Kill la Kill. It's their earlier work.
[00:34:36] <TsundereNoises> K-on is another one, there are like 3? beach episodes? and those are great episodes with character development
[00:34:43] <TsundereNoises> they just also involve going to the beach
[00:35:02] <TsundereNoises> you should ALSO watch Kill la Kill
[00:35:20] <emmeka> yeah, watch both Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill, they're like required viewing

[00:41:23] <emmeka> TsundereNoises you know what yuri manga I think really deserves an anime because it would be so much better as one and would also bring in a lot of non-yuri viewers

[00:41:59] <TsundereNoises> YES
[00:42:17] <TsundereNoises> yeah animating the action scenes would be so cool
[00:42:39] <Roey> Gosh, I mis-read that as: <TsundereNoises> yeah animating the erecction scenes would be so cool
[00:42:46] <Roey> I suppose.
[00:42:57] <emmeka> action as erection? something on your mind?
[00:44:02] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I just thought that because it's been a while since we had any sort of series which had lesbian MCs that wasn't like, explicitly just a yuri romance shoujo-y story. Otherside Picnic tried, it was pretty lame.
[00:44:03] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: my one worry would be that some misguided marketting person would try to tone it down
[00:44:21] <emmeka> if you toned down Murciélago what would be the point of it
[00:44:26] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[00:44:34] <TsundereNoises> it needs to be the most over the top thing ever in all aspects

[00:47:32] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I'm happy that we're getting more fantasy shows with female protagonists lately, but it's frustrating they all slightly tease yuri elements and won't commit to it
[00:47:40] <TsundereNoises> like we've somewhat moved past that in other genres
[00:47:49] <TsundereNoises> but fantasy must always leave ambiguity for some reason
[00:48:01] <emmeka> hey, there was Endro.
[00:48:05] <TsundereNoises> that's true
[00:48:08] <TsundereNoises> I love endro
[00:48:14] <TsundereNoises> I want more endro

[00:48:37] <TsundereNoises> I also want Namori to be involved with more anime
[00:49:01] <TsundereNoises> Endro and Release the Spyce, we need to give her more work
[00:49:37] <TsundereNoises> also Yuru Yuri of course

[00:51:10] <TsundereNoises> I think I liked it more than Endro actually
[00:51:23] <TsundereNoises> but that's very apples to oranges
[00:52:16] <emmeka> TsundereNoises there seem to have been a lot of LNs recently that are very much tapping into the market of "people who watched Villainness but wanted it to go the yuri route"
[00:52:20] <emmeka> which is I guess positive
[00:52:49] <emmeka> like A Lily Blooms in Another World, or, I'm In Love with the Villainness.
[00:53:22] <emmeka> both just being about reincarnation into an otome game, but going the clearly yuri route
[00:53:22] <TsundereNoises> I remember trying to read a few WNs a few years back in that vein too

[21:17:18] <TsundereNoises> at this point it is almost surely an actual addiction
[21:17:21] <senti> at this point, it's practically a physical impulse
[21:18:01] <senti> it's. How do I describe it. the thought of alcohol, it's like it makes me horny. Sorry for my language, but that's what it does.
[21:18:26] <Nanobot> It's probably too hard to just stop altogether, but maybe you can find something less harmful that can do for you most of what alcohol currently does, and switch to that.
[21:18:47] <Nanobot> Switch one habit for another
[21:18:57] <senti> I dunno
[21:19:04] <senti> my life is pretty boring
[21:19:04] <TsundereNoises> senti: the problem is, it sounds like it's getting to the point where it's either alcohol, or any other forms of happiness (like having enough money to buy shit) and you're going to choose alcohol every time with the attitude you have
[21:19:07] <mexen> Quit slowly, in steps
[21:19:09] <klaxa> have you tried smoking pot
[21:19:21] <senti> weed makes me have panic attacks

[21:19:27] <klaxa> too bad
[21:20:08] <senti> TsundereNoises: aye, you have me pegged
[21:20:15] <TsundereNoises> senti: I mean, I've talked to you a lot
[21:20:38] <senti> indeed, you are a friend to me, TsundereNoises
[21:21:08] <TsundereNoises> senti: sadly I'm kind of distracted at the moment, but yeah I think you actually do need to quit the booze altogether, although that'll be tough
[21:21:11] <TsundereNoises> at least for a while
[21:21:44] <TsundereNoises> also AA seems so cult-like it creeps me out
[21:22:06] <senti> I have to think a lot. I'm now jobless. Change is on the way, I want to think. But maybe I'll drink myself to death. There are two paths before me.

[22:49:17] <ButterNoodle> yea, she dont like guys.. dont have to worry about it

[23:31:38] <Poeticode> wow an isekai even _I_ can't stomach watching
[23:32:00] <Poeticode> Drugstore in another world was ridiculously boring

[23:32:47] <Poeticode> I'm ok with slice-of-life shows but the characters were just so flat and uninteresting
[23:33:04] <MootPoot> what, you calling my waifu flat??
[23:33:15] <MootPoot> Poeticode:  its not a slice of life show though
[23:33:19] *** Joins: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor)
[23:33:22] <MootPoot> its not even about the characters
[23:33:31] <MootPoot> its just world building / educational
[23:33:57] <Poeticode> what's not slice-of-life about it?
[23:34:09] <Poeticode> and the show gave no reason to care for the world
[23:34:26] <MootPoot> the "world" is not the world of isekai
[23:34:41] <MootPoot> the "world" is of basic medicine
[23:35:48] <MootPoot> you're watching it trying to be wooed by the characters or the overall story, but thats just not something its trying to do tbh
[23:35:52] <MootPoot> back when I read it
[23:35:56] <Poeticode> except it doesn't show how he makes potions / etc
[23:36:13] <MootPoot> maybe the anime version is nerfed
[23:36:14] <Poeticode> so it fails at being about basic medicine there
[23:36:16] <MootPoot> I read the manga
[23:36:47] <Poeticode> why would you read this garbage?
[23:37:26] <MootPoot> theres a subgenre of shows about real topics in isekai worlds
[23:37:29] <MootPoot> not many entries in there
[23:38:03] <Poeticode> hmm yeah like those isekai cooking shows
[23:38:29] *** Quits: Aurora_v_kosmose (~LispyLigh@user/lispylights) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[23:38:33] <MootPoot> the point is to just really cover the topic under a veneer of slice of life or overall story

[23:45:57] <MootPoot> It should be it's own genre really
[23:46:10] <MootPoot> Leads to false expectation
[23:47:58] *** Joins: Aurora_v_kosmose (~LispyLigh@user/lispylights)
[23:51:39] <Poeticode> it's probably a sub-genre that just isn't for me. I don't see a point in learning about topics in an isekai if the characters are boring and the isekai itself is unimaginative
[23:52:19] <Poeticode> still probably ok as a 5-beers-and-two-bowls-in show
[23:58:14] <sentionics> wut
[23:58:25] <sentionics> who drinks 5 beers
[23:58:38] *** sentionics is now known as senti
