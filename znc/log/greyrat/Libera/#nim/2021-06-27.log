[01:22:22] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> I essentially want to pass the contents of another nim file into a macro as typed
[01:22:24] <FromDiscord> <dom96> yep, you can `parseStmt`/`parseExpr` IIRC

I'm messing around with a macro that you can write Nim code underneath, have the compiler check it, and then translate it into Lua. That really blows my mind that something like that is possible.
[02:39:49] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> Is there a way to verify if a NimNode is correct from a procedure?

[10:46:24] <FromDiscord> <garett> has it been considered to shorten `converter` to `conv` and `iterator` to `iter`?
[10:47:31] <FromDiscord> <garett> the truncation would align nicely with `proc`
[10:48:03] <fn> <06Prestige99> I doubt they'd want to change it but you could probably just make your own keywords to use
[10:48:23] <FromDiscord> <garett> perhaps using longer keywords is intended to make `converter` and `iterator` more visually distinct from `proc`
[10:48:56] <FromDiscord> <garett> it just seems strange to truncate `procedure` to `proc` then be verbose elsewhere 🙂
[10:49:25] <fn> <06Prestige99> Yeah I agree, proc and func I guess are typed a lot more though

[17:52:07] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> Is there any way to have a variant type automatically call a correct proc? For example, could I make a proc that only works on JInts without accepting JsonNode and then checking the kind field explicitly?
[17:54:57] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> No, unfortunately there isn't. Aside from some template that automates the case statement + calling the correct proc it clashes between runtime (the kind) / compile time (the proc to select) information
[17:56:56] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> Got it... Seems like I might be better off using methods/dynamic dispatch then
[17:59:05] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> I personally don't mind it too much. In your own code you can usually abstract most of it away with a template. It only becomes complicated if you need to return different types for different kinds
[18:00:24] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> My specific use case is making a simple interpreter - I was considering storing each type of statement as a variant object (say kind: add, subtract, divide, multiply) and then having some sort of statement.process function that would pick the right proc defined based on the variant kind. Not sure if this is the "right" solution to this problem but it is the best I could come up with
[18:01:17] <fn> <11ForumUpdaterBot99> New thread by Geohuz: "No handles or timers registered in dispatcher" in Chapter 3.17 example of Nim In Action, see https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8163
[18:02:54] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> Sure, that works. As long as you have some sort of variant type for values it's even quite easy to implement. Makes me think of my first dataframe impl. in ggplotnim with a fully dynamic formula syntax here\:↵https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim/blob/fixFormulaImpl/src/ggplotnim/dataframe/fallback/formula.nim
[18:03:41] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> I have an `enum` for different operations and build a tree for formulas which I could evaluate (procs at the bottom)
[18:07:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Usually, interpreters dispatch on `.kind` field value inside a `while` loop. It is the fastest implementation approach as well (at least from different ways to implement dispatching)↵(@ajusa)
[18:11:39] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> Got it, I'll try that out then. Thanks for the information!
[18:18:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> vindaar\:  I pushed `hpprint` v2 to `hmisc` (along with some additional features). It is not fully done as of now, but all functionality of `hpprint v1` is now available. You can import new version as `hmisc/other/hpprint`. Api is the same - `pprint` on any value will pretty-print it.
[18:19:15] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> Cool, thanks for the heads up!
[18:19:33] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://paste.rs/GOq
[18:21:48] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> so many features 😁
[18:22:16] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> well, I mostly use it as `pprint` a well
[18:22:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But sometimes is is necessary to configure things in a very detailed manner, but I"m not sure if I need to make too much accend on that
[18:23:51] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> Certainly sounds useful for specific use cases. I guess not for debugging or anything, so the verbose API isn't too much of a problem maybe?
[18:24:14] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I use it solely for debugging purposes
[18:25:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And I tend of think of it as two APIs - first one is dead simple\: `pprint <thing>` and it works
[18:25:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> always
[18:25:09] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> zero configuration is necessary
[18:25:17] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But then you can get very nuanced and start writing custom hooks, or doing callside configuration, but that is rarely needed
[18:25:21] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> so you need the config for debugging when there'd be too much random output?
[18:26:38] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> yes, quickly cut out some unnecessary noise. I think I could just add helpers `pglob().star().field("cpack").match()`, something like `matchFields(@["cpack"])`, or `matchType(@["GCovLine"]): forceLine()`
[18:27:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> \`ignore = matchFields(@["cpack"])
[18:27:29] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> that sounds like a useful feature, yes
[18:29:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But there is a ton of control already, especially because I built it on top of generic layout solver
[18:29:27] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Is is just very verbose

[20:02:49] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> above boring it's frustrating
[20:03:21] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> in the age of containers and all this stuff, why not have it easy to download some container to debug the CI locally?
[20:03:31] <federico3> ...because most implementations are pretty rudimentary
[20:05:24] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> in what sense?
[20:07:31] <FromDiscord> <leorize> redhat's toolkit is one of the very interesting application of containers
[20:08:20] <FromDiscord> <leorize> the issue with how most containers work is that they're designed for daemon isolation
[20:08:43] <FromDiscord> <leorize> toolkit take an approach of integrating a container with your main system
[20:09:02] <FromDiscord> <leorize> it's kinda like a chroot, but no permission meddling
[20:09:23] <FromDiscord> <leorize> and you also don't run as root
[20:09:55] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I think the problem is I have too many projects
[20:10:02] <FromDiscord> <dom96> all with old CI that's been broken for a while
[20:10:10] <FromDiscord> <dom96> getting the motivation to fix them all is tough
[20:10:22] <FromDiscord> <leorize> you should let go the ones you no longer maintain
[20:10:39] <federico3> vindaar: stuff like github actions & similar barely spawn a bunch of containers and runs scripts. They don't have mechanisms to plan tests dynamically and track down errors; snapshot checkpoints during the process; not even ssh into the vm after a failure
[20:10:50] <FromDiscord> <dom96> I'm adding a cron schedule to all of them now
[20:11:01] <FromDiscord> <dom96> so I can hopefully see when the CI starts to fail earlier
[20:11:32] <FromDiscord> <leorize> there are plenty of active members in the community that will want to adopt your projects, should you no longer want to maintain them
[20:13:59] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> but that's my point no? It shouldn't be too difficult to set it up such that each action / etc. is run in one container that the user can download if need be? I mean maybe it's super hard I know barely anything about containers. I only hear hype hype hype around them↵(<@709044657232936960_federico3=5b=49=52=43=5d>)
[20:14:26] <FromDiscord> <dom96> the way all CIs work is a poor model
[20:15:00] <FromDiscord> <dom96> the CI just runs some arbitrary code which is really unhelpful to figure out flakiness
[20:15:14] <federico3> dom96: that's what I said
[20:15:45] <FromDiscord> <leorize> [vindaar](https://matrix.to/#/@vindaar:matrix.org)\: the issue of containers is that right now they are only useful for running their own environment
