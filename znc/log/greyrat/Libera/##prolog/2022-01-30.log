[12:51:36] <dmiles_afk> that is one of our clients actually specializes in that
[12:52:06] <sakasama> No. I've been working on constraints logic language, vaguely similar to mercury.
[12:53:32] <sakasama> It's in a combination of C++ and prolog at the moment, though the aim is for it to eventually be self-hosting.
[12:53:52] <dmiles_afk> haver to seen the Curry conmpiler? (it is written in SWI-Prolog)

[12:54:52] <sakasama> At one point, I think, but I didn't peer very deeply.
[12:55:18] <dmiles_afk> ok abotu like me.. great that you were aware enough to know of it's existence 
[12:56:47] <dmiles_afk> by type constraints is this a sematic rulesy thing or a type theory thing?
[12:57:31] <dmiles_afk> oops .. you didnt say "types" but the same quiestion minus "types"
[12:57:45] <sakasama> fwiw, I probably just stumbled onto it via #proglangdesign.
[12:58:20] <sakasama> It's type theory, essentially, though I've adopted a nonstandard model.
[12:59:06] <dmiles_afk> what would be nice is to finally see peopel doing paraconsistent type theory

[13:00:16] <dmiles_afk> that would probably mean that the runtime only thjought about the type theory as it was runinng.. milling out the partial program as it goes
[13:02:52] <sakasama> I do find the closed world assumption to be rather limiting.

[13:04:00] <dmiles_afk> openjworld logic is totally doable .. a person jsut has to accept the jopen world methodologies thast seems to not be taught or exmplained much
[13:04:21] <sakasama> Well founded semantics at least has a reasonable evaluation cost, though I'm not sure what happens beyond that.
[13:06:25] <dmiles_afk> i think the most brilliant inference system i've seen is PTTP extends with non-negation by failure .. it uses a 4 state logic
[13:06:36] <dmiles_afk> extended*
