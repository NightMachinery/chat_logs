[00:11:00] <sheep> you need it for a lot of common drivers, like most GPUs, a lot of network interfaces, and a lot of audio interfaces

[04:23:25] <defnotHD> The install doesn't fail but the output to the GPU doesn't work but all the drivers are loaded fine.
[04:23:28] <MrElendig> not that there was much info in said messages
[04:23:38] <MrElendig> except "doesn't work"
[04:23:49] <defnotHD> I added a spice channel to view what was going on and everything looks okay.

[04:24:23] <alschaapman> Can you clarify about "output to the GPU"? Do you mean that nothing happens on your screen?
[04:24:45] <defnotHD> alschaapman: correct. After installing there is no output to the screen.

[04:25:56] <MrElendig> you should at least get the bootloader and loading kernel messages....
[04:26:16] <defnotHD> correct there is NO output to the screen at all. The screen wakes up then reads "no signal"

[04:27:12] <MrElendig> also still haven't told us what card it is, except that its green
[04:27:17] <alschaapman> You didn't install a boot loader, did you?
[04:27:24] <MrElendig> and nouveau is pretty useless on most cards
[04:27:40] <alschaapman> I'm ready to place my bet now. No boot loader. Who wants to get in on this action
[04:27:49] <MrElendig> (and completely broken with others)
[04:28:04] <defnotHD> its a gtx960 and the nouveau is the driver that the live media is loading.
[04:28:24] <defnotHD> alschaapman: yes there is a boot loader. When I fire up the spice viewer I can view everythingn working fine.
[04:29:01] <defnotHD> when I add a spice channel I can get into the system and check drivers and everything.
[04:29:45] <NetSysFire> you should definitely try using the proprietary driver
[04:29:55] <NetSysFire> i dont know what the archiso uses though
[04:29:56] <alschaapman> Hmm. That is really weird that your system would be able to output anything graphical but wouldn't even show anything on screen at the boot loader stage
[04:30:13] <alschaapman> Did you configure automatic boot selection or something so that the boot menu is skipped?
[04:30:23] <alschaapman> It's just weird to me that you wouldn't even get anything on screen at that stage
[04:30:29] <NetSysFire> no, the system boots correctly but fails to show video
[04:30:35] <defnotHD> No, I can see the grub menu during boot through spice...
[04:30:46] <NetSysFire> if they connect via spice, something vnc like, they can see everything

[08:16:11] <phrik> Title: List of applications - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[08:16:49] <blinux> That is close, I've been through that list before. I'll take another look. But I'm pretty sure I haven't found anything. They mix dialogue runners, application launchers and application finders all in one.
[08:16:52] <ectospasm> I use something called yeganesh piped into dmenu on XMonad, but that doesn't list things by category

[08:21:27] <KingShark> i installed a very extensive package group and on second thought would rather not. pacman -R <group> runs into dependency issues. will i have to go through the group members one by one to remove them where it works?

[08:23:30] <ectospasm> KingShark: you could probably write a script to go through them, but I'm not sure how you'd order the list for it.  Maybe dig around the `pacman -Q` documentation.
[08:24:07] <ectospasm> So, some magic `pacman -Q` incantation piped into `pacman -R`

[11:44:21] <gtlsgamr> I play red dead online, on steam, on arch linux using proton. Until last night it was working fine, I used "prime-run %command%" as a launch option to start the game. Last night I updated and went to sleep, and since morning it fails to load up. It gives an error "Failed to initialize graphics device. Reboot or reinstall graphics driver"
[11:44:50] <gtlsgamr> thurstylark: ERR_GFX_INIT is the name of the error and from the googling I did, it seems like vulkan can be the culprit.
[11:46:10] <gtlsgamr> If I run it without prime-run, it loads using the integrated AMD GPU and starts up just fine

[13:49:24] <gtlsgamr> Hello people, so I managed to fix my Red Dead online problem, and as I suspected it was something wrong with a few packages related to mesa. They were updated on 21st August and I rolled back to 20th August packages and voila! The games worked perfectly. Here are the packages that caused this... http://0x0.st/-tra.txt
[13:49:47] <gtlsgamr> I still don't know which one of these caused it because I would like to file a bug report. Any suggestions on that?
[13:49:55] <gtlsgamr> On how to find which package caused it
[13:50:10] <thurstylark> the bug is that you weren't updated
[13:50:15] <thurstylark> there is no report to make
[13:50:59] <gtlsgamr> No no, I don't think you understand. I did update on 21st and that's when the game stopped working. Once I rolled back that update, it works fine.
[13:51:08] <earnestly> colo: In theory you could include a 99-user.fonts as a symlink of 50-fonts.conf to re-read the user section so to order things more normally but otherwise there is no solution for this

Context: I want to make iostat behave like top; more context: terminal scrollback for a few terminals is unreasonably large but I don't want to start those terminals with a
[16:41:14] <MacGyver> different config file turning their scrollback down *entirely*.
[16:42:14] <MacGyver> Telling me which terms to google for is also fine, I'm finding that I don't know enough about terminal mechanics to know the names of the different output modes.
[16:44:42] <MacGyver> Like, the mode the terminal goes into when you run a command using `watch`, the problem is that `watch` restarts the command every n seconds; I want it to merely "re-sample the output", so to speak.
[16:45:01] <edgy> MacGyver: you mean like tail -f?
[16:45:10] <MacGyver> No.
[16:45:37] <MacGyver> tail operates in the "normal" terminal mode.

[17:07:41] <nobodies> hey guys, just wondering if something is possible before i do it and find I can't boot. can i encrypt a partition with luks then add my /boot /root /home to that with lvm and unlock and boot using grub?
[17:07:56] <nobodies> i know grub can unlock luks, but wasn't sure if it could then read the /boot from an lvm?
[17:08:07] <nobodies> or does /boot need to be a partition on it's own?
[17:08:10] <MacGyver> rcf: Still ends up in the scrollback it seems.
[17:08:19] *** Joins: Severus (~Thunderbi@user/severus)
[17:08:35] <MacGyver> rcf: Good suggestion though.
[17:08:55] <MacGyver> rcf: Interesting to see the terminal behave that way, but it only influences what's displayed, not what's "kept", seemingly.
[17:09:19] <Namarrgon> nobodies: is /boot encrypted or not?
[17:10:11] <nobodies> Namarrgon: it would be because it would be LUKS -> LVM -> /boot
[17:10:33] <rcf> MacGyver: if all else fails, treat it as a problem of replacing every nth newline with `tput clear` 
[17:11:10] <MacGyver> I *think* that's what the perl solution zbe linked does.
[17:11:18] <MacGyver> Trying to get that to work now.
[17:12:01] <Namarrgon> nobodies: yes, that works. if you use LUKSv1 headers then grub can load the kernel from an encrypted /boot.
[17:12:33] <Namarrgon> nobodies: there is some limited LUKSv2 support but it's probably not worth the hassle if you don't need any of the v2 features
[17:13:04] <nobodies> @namaand it won't matter its also in an lvm?
[17:13:14] <daspork> Yeah I can't find it. It's not a coincidence that docker is capping at exactly 100mbit.... In the host I can get ~260mbit. No idea what else to check...
[17:13:15] <nobodies> oops Namarrgon
[17:13:18] <Namarrgon> nobodies: grub supports lvm just fine
[17:13:38] <nobodies> kk thank you! but you'd advise v1 luks?
[17:13:39] <nl6720> except for thing provisioned logical volumes
[17:13:43] <nl6720> *thin
[17:13:59] <Namarrgon> nobodies: if in doubt then stick with v1

[22:24:17] <grazzolini> pounce: it depends on several things. a) the domain and search parameters on resolv.conf b) the settings on nssswitch.conf c) ssh client settings themselves.
[22:24:43] <pounce> but if it's pinging it should be resolving, right?
[22:26:31] <grazzolini> pounce: no, ssh has different settings for that. man ssh_config and check for CanonicalNames
