[00:24:43] <gwozniak> I can see it as a stunt, but do you think you'd be able to hold that position for long if you actually tried it?
[00:26:24] <manicennui> Depends on the company.

[00:44:47] <manicennui> "I've probably done around 15 hours of real work since I started in January of last year"
[00:44:56] <companion_cube> how illegal is that?
[00:45:10] <manicennui> I'm not sure that it is.
[00:45:31] <manicennui> They could certainly fire you if they found out, but I don't think you are violating any laws.
[00:45:46] <companion_cube> that seems surprisingly deceiving, but yeah, I guess it's on the employers
[00:46:01] <companion_cube> and that's why we're sinking deeper into distrust and surveillance
[00:46:13] <manicennui> I took a look at their FAQ, and they mention avoiding conflicts like competing companies.
[00:46:37] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yeah, but if the company is happy with your output, what is the problem?
[00:46:47] <manicennui> The surveillance shit just seems like bad management.
[00:47:46] <manicennui> Not condoning this behavior, but trying to micromanage things, block sites, surveil employees, etc. is always the wrong solution.
[00:48:17] <manicennui> That this person does so little work at this one job is obviously the problem.
[00:50:29] <manicennui> "t 4200 dollars a week to go to a standup each morning to say I have nothing to do since *October*, job 4 is somehow an even bigger cake walk than job 1."
[00:50:31] <companion_cube> right, it should be clear to colleagues
[00:51:05] <companion_cube> that's crazy though, "I have nothing to do" and no one rises an eyebrow?
[00:51:06] <manicennui> s/t /at /
[00:51:26] <manicennui> I don't find it completely hard to believe.
[00:51:55] <manicennui> Although my employer isn't *that* bad, I've definitely seen people milk a story for weeks and complete very little.
[00:55:18] <manicennui> I wonder how much more difficult it would be to just create a contracting company and find a bunch of contracts for your employees and take a cut.
[00:55:58] <manicennui> I've seen companies tolerate a lot of incompetence from contractors.
[00:56:13] <manicennui> And they aren't cheap.
[00:56:33] <manicennui> No one has to lie and you can screw companies out of money without worry.
[00:59:52] <manicennui> companion_cube: https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s6f5ze/one_of_the_most_frequently_asked_questions_about/
[00:59:53] <buttsbot> One of the most frequently asked questions about OE is its "legality" - please read this. : overemployed
[01:00:33] <manicennui> "The exception to this would be if you did something extra risky while employed - you had access to proprietary company secrets, or you were found to be working for your company's chief competitor, or you stole things from your job, or you were in such a high position in the company that you represented a threat to the company's operations."
[01:01:07] <manicennui> I think my employer's handbook might have something about this.

[08:07:22] <gwozniak> In the old days of F1 they didn't put the fires out

[17:55:49] <gwozniak> I think the Dragon book is still a useful book, but not I would put it as supplementary reading in a compiler course these days
[18:08:25] <gerikson> omg a cursory read of Wikipedia shows SICP was replaced by a Python course in 2008
[18:08:34] <gwozniak> Yes, I remember that
[18:08:55] <gwozniak> SICP hasn't really been used for a while, I don't think
[18:09:13] <gerikson> vestigial
[18:09:26] <gwozniak> It's just a "go to" book because it was very influencial in the 90s
[18:09:49] <gwozniak> Still a decent book, I think
[18:10:03] <gerikson> oh, I'm sure
[18:10:35] <gwozniak> I'm not going to put it on a pedestal, but it's worth working through some of it, at the very least
[18:12:43] <pja> gwozniak: Yeah, the Dragon book is very much of its time.
[18:13:12] <gerikson> I could barely get through Higher-Order Perl
[18:13:16] <Geekingfrog> What would you recommend as a more modern/up to date alternative ?
[18:13:17] * gerikson is a dum-dum
[18:16:40] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: for an introductory compiler textbook?  I honestly don't know.
[18:17:10] <pja> gerikson: Why would you do that to yourself?
[18:17:23] <Geekingfrog> and without the introductory adjective?
[18:17:43] <pja> Geekingfrog: We had this discussion a couple of days ago. If you have enough scrollback you can find a few recommendations.
[18:19:14] *** kl1n3 is now known as kline
[18:19:20] <gerikson> pja: HOP is a great book
[18:19:25] <gerikson> MJD is a good author
[18:19:38] <gerikson> and there's a ton of interesting stuff in the book
[18:19:42] <pja> gerikson: Yes, but it’s in Perl.
[18:19:53] <gerikson> that's what makes it good !
[18:20:08] <pja> Geekingfrog: “Crafting Interpreters” was recommended IIRC.
[18:20:12] <gwozniak> All my compiler books are getting to be 20 years old or more at this point.  I don't know what the cirriculums look like any more
[18:20:18] <pja> Perl bad!
[18:20:19] <Geekingfrog> pja, I see that, currently reading my logs
[18:20:29] <Geekingfrog> crafting interpreters is pretty good yeah.
[18:21:04] <pja> (I have programmed Perl, but every time I come back to it I dislike it. It’s very hard to read someone else’s Perl ime.)
[18:21:06] <gwozniak> I always liked Michael Scott's book (Programming Language Pragmatics)
[18:21:32] <pja> Maybe “Engineering a Compiler” ?
[18:21:46] <pja> PLP shows up as an Amazon recommendation.
[18:22:18] <gerikson> pja: yeah that's Perl's big failing (whih I believe it shares with Lisp) - it's way to easy to write code that fits *your* brain but no-one else's
[18:22:42] <gerikson> I don't wanna shit on people, but writing compilers is pretty niche
[18:23:02] <gerikson> all due respect for those who do write them but it's not for everyone
[18:23:45] <gwozniak> Writing a serious one takes a lot of effort.
[18:24:48] <pja> & then we have Google, who crap out incompatible Python variants like they’re going out of fashion.
[18:25:10] <pja> (What are they on now? It’s at least three in production use IIRC.)

[19:41:03] <manicennui> WTF is a crore, and why did they do that with the commas?

[19:43:54] <leon> but why
[19:43:56] <imode> arbitrary precision arithmetic is required to deal with that.
[19:44:15] <manicennui> But they have given 1.65 billion doses. Wonder which vaccine it is.

[20:54:44] <prussian> but what even is structured programming?
[20:55:04] <prussian> is early return and loop break structured?
[20:55:43] <Brekkjern> "Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines."
[20:55:45] <riv> only 1 return
[20:55:46] <Brekkjern> Soo.... Programming?
[20:55:58] <riv> its something to do with flow charts
[20:56:04] <riv> its not really important
[20:56:13] <companion_cube> Brekkjern: well, it was compared to goto
[20:56:43] <Brekkjern> Which is what underpins all those control flow constructs, just with a prettier packaging?
[20:58:43] <prussian> there can be only one.
[20:59:26] <gwozniak> I always saw "structured programming" to be using constructs on top of goto instead of using goto directly
[21:01:01] <gwozniak> dammit, I forgot that I cleaned up my build of the libraries so now I need to build them again
[21:01:39] <gwozniak> Was about to test out a horrible hack I made to backend of the compiler
[21:01:53] <gwozniak> s/to backend/to the backend/
[21:02:10] <companion_cube> Brekkjern: it's just that goto was a horrible mess
[21:02:15] <gwozniak> Now I have to wait about an hour
[21:02:24] <companion_cube> so, introducing some structure and convincing people not to use goto except in last resort, was, in fact, good :D
[21:02:33] <gwozniak> Reading "goto" code is downright horrible
[21:02:35] <companion_cube> that's what the famous Dijkstra paper was about
[21:02:50] <companion_cube> not "goto is 100% bad", just, use it sparingly
[21:03:04] <gwozniak> Sadly, people took it to mean "don't ever use goto"
[21:03:30] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: It's just that it feels like a "instead of adding a number together X number of times manually, you can use the multiplication operator instead"
[21:03:58] <Brekkjern> It was probably profound for the time, but nowadays you'd be hard pressed to find people who actually know how to use goto
[21:04:00] <companion_cube> isn't that a huge improvement?
[21:04:12] <Brekkjern> Absolutely
[21:04:16] <companion_cube> ah well, today you still have C programmers who don't have anything better than goto
[21:04:25] <Brekkjern> Sucks to be them :D

[21:05:14] <companion_cube> I'd sooner write a shitty language that generates assembly, tbh
[21:05:18] <Brekkjern> I've only written assembly once and that was for a CTF

[21:05:48] <Brekkjern> kline: It was made for the CTF
