[01:21:45] <emanuele6> Except for the '˜' and "!˜" operators, and in the gsub, match, split, and sub built-in functions, ERE matching shall be based on input records; that is, record separator characters (the first character of the value of the variable RS, <newline> by default) cannot be embedded in the expression, and no expression shall match the record separator character. If the record separator is not <newline>,
[01:21:47] <emanuele6> <newline> characters embedded in the expression can be matched. For the '˜' and "!˜" operators, and in those four built-in functions, ERE matching shall be based on text strings; that is, any character (including <newline> and the record separator) can be embedded in the pattern, and an appropriate pattern shall match any character. However, in all awk ERE matching, the use of one or more NUL
[01:21:49] <emanuele6> characters in the pattern, input record, or text string produces undefined results.
[01:21:54] <emanuele6> oops, that was longer than i thought

[01:23:21] <shbot> emanuele6: etc... ( http://ix.io/3Lig )
[01:24:04] <emanuele6> am i missing something? shouldn't /\n/ be valid with RS=y or RS=x?
[01:24:17] <emanuele6> that text is from https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/awk.html
[01:44:36] *** Joins: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog)
[01:44:56] <emanuele6> actually setting RS should not even be necessary
[01:47:32] <emanuele6> the first character of RS may not match or be invalid in a regex when used on the current record with /pat/, gsub(), match(), split(), or sub()
[01:47:49] <emanuele6> but $0 ~ /X/ where X is the first character of RS should be allowed
[01:48:01] <emanuele6> and /a/ should not be allowed if RS="a"
[01:48:58] <emanuele6> but nawk in its regex parser simply never allows "\n"
