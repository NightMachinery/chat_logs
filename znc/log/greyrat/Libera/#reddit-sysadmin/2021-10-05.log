[19:01:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> signofzeta yup! its crazy how that is
[19:01:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> the Canadian gov negotiates and purchases the meds en masse
[19:01:42] <signofzeta> glad I don't need insulin.  my "convenience" (i.e., not dying) meds are only $22 four times a year.

[19:02:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> only med I have to pay for out of pocket is my iron 
[19:02:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> iron supplements are not covered by prescription drug coverage becaues they are available OTC
[19:02:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> my pharmacist is great though
[19:02:40] <sintax> i took excedrin today
[19:02:42] <int0x1C8> at least I can see now what they gave me to keep me under
[19:02:42] <sintax> do i count
[19:02:42] <teh_f4ll3n> that's too about three fiddy over here
[19:02:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> if they "sell" it as a prescribed item the cost is higher than me buying the exact same med OTC. 
[19:02:58] <signofzeta> my meds only prevent me from racking up an ER bill, that's all.  if I changed my diet and lost weight, it probably won't be an issue anymore. (working on it!)
[19:03:08] <int0x1C8> propofol, midazolam, lidocaine, fentanyl, and rocuronium bromide

[21:09:02] <mistiry> terraform is for the infra. DSC (ansible, chef, etc) is to set up the system itself.

[21:50:59] <iphone> is the ip command in linux a language? Because it has a grammar associated with its commands?

[22:14:19] <iphone> but I wrote a python thing to pull data and upload it to aws redshift so I can push the data into business reports with tableau. Each table in the redshift database is configured with a yaml file telling it how to pull the data from upstream, where to store it, how to filter it, etc.

[22:15:34] <mrskeltal> is there an app where you can run python as CLI?
[22:15:36] <iphone> so instead of rewriting the script 10 times for each table, I generalized the script and added parameters so it would be configurable... and yaml is the best thing for that when using python
[22:15:43] <mrskeltal> and i don't mean just running python lol
[22:15:45] <iphone> mrskeltal: yeah, its called /bin/python

[22:16:28] <iphone> np
[22:17:01] <iphone> thanks mr skeltal
[22:17:03] <iphone> lol
[22:17:09] <mrskeltal> i wonder if there's a 3rd party json library for python that makes handling json easier
[22:17:17] <mrskeltal> DOOT DOOT
[22:18:00] <iphone> there is
[22:18:06] <iphone> it just loads the data as a python dict
[22:18:29] <iphone> and its built into python 3
[22:18:32] <mrskeltal> i just hate that it doesn't support nested objects or recursive json translation
[22:18:45] <mrskeltal> you have to json.loads EVERY SINGLE nested object
[22:18:46] <mrskeltal> it's fucking awful
[22:19:05] <mrskeltal> any sort of large nested json data set = pain
[22:19:12] <sd> 15<i​ must be loyle to my capo> better than bash at least
[22:19:19] <mrskeltal> yeah but this is why i use powershell lol
[22:19:33] <iphone> that sounds wrong mrskeltal 
[22:19:42] <mrskeltal> also node ofc handles json ez mode
[22:20:02] <sd> 15<i​ must be loyle to my capo> yaml for ruby, json for node
[22:20:17] <mrskeltal> is it bad to install the node interpreter on every linux box we have O_O
[22:21:30] <iphone> mrskeltal: the json lib should handle nested objects just fine, but if it doesn't for some odd reason, you can probably convert json to yaml then load that lmao
[22:21:30] <mrskeltal> also powershell handles json pretty damn well
[22:21:46] <iphone> that would actually be better, all hail yaml
[22:21:51] <sd> 15<i​ must be loyle to my capo> nah
[22:22:04] <sd> 15<i​ must be loyle to my capo> yaml sucks as an actual format for storing data
[22:22:06] <mrskeltal> idk, i pull nested json objects from aws cli all the time
[22:22:32] <mrskeltal> i need to re-reference the reference
[22:22:38] <mrskeltal> maybe there's a different method i should use
[22:23:43] <iphone> the only complaint I have with yaml is the handling of booleans. There should be a dedicated symbol for true/false, like ~true or something
[22:23:59] <mrskeltal> i don't mind yaml tbh
[22:24:19] <mrskeltal> works great with docker compose
[22:24:41] <mrskeltal> for template files i think yaml works well
[22:24:47] <iphone> I've been using podman for rhcsa, big fan. Its integrates with kubernetes and linux bigly
[22:24:47] <mrskeltal> although i'd never want it to store data
[22:24:58] <PublicWiFi> iphone: teach me mr devops
[22:25:00] <iphone> yeah, I love yaml as configuration
[22:25:07] <mrskeltal> yaml for config is ideal tbh
[22:25:13] <iphone> PublicWiFi: first you gotta watch more kingcobrajfs
[22:25:23] <mrskeltal> i actually prefer it over json for config
[22:25:30] <mrskeltal> json better for storing data
[22:25:33] <iphone> agreed
[22:25:35] <mrskeltal> yaml better for config
[22:25:37] <iphone> json is less ambiguous
[22:25:49] <mrskeltal> json just has too much syntax for config tbh
[22:25:59] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> json should _only_ be used to store human readable data imo
