[10:48:19] <dragestil> Regarding the javascript trap, has any progress been made about the ability of running your own version of javascript scripts in a browser for specific websites?
[10:48:46] <dragestil> I'm referring to https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html and more specifically > Browser users also need a convenient facility to specify JavaScript code to use instead of the JavaScript in a certain page. (The specified code might be total replacement, or a modified version of the free JavaScript program in that page.) Greasemonkey comes close to being able to do this, but not quite, since it doesn't guarantee to modify the JavaScript code in 
[10:48:46] <dragestil> a page before that program starts to execute. Using a local proxy works, but is too inconvenient now to be a real solution. We need to construct a solution that is reliable and convenient, as well as sites for sharing changes. The GNU Project would like to recommend sites which are dedicated to free changes only.

[12:08:36] <AdorableTanuki[m> This is my first ever minor victory in free software. I have successfully negotiated a deal with a company that if I buy one copy of their software, I will be provided all of the source code. I am not only allowed to publicly release this source code under the MIT Expat licence, but they will be publicly hosting the source code on GitHub as well. They also have agreed to release all patches, bug fixes, and updates to the GitHub repository
[12:08:36] <AdorableTanuki[m> under the same licence.
[12:09:45] <AdorableTanuki[m> Most of their code is already free but there are certain features they keep behind a one-time payment. My small negotiation gets rid of that completely and makes it free for everyone.

Instead, I am the sole owner of my funds, privacy, and transaction history.

[13:02:49] <kompowiec2__> yes, in theory no one can take money from crypto. To the famous 51% problem
[13:04:09] <kompowiec2__> when the blog is large it naturally leads to centralization.  when it's small it's easy to attack.  An unsolvable problem
[13:04:16] <kompowiec2__> block*
[13:05:55] <AdorableTanuki[m> That's the reason I actually quite like the idea of Monero. It's designed to be ASIC-resistant which prevents companies from creating what they have for many other cryptocurrency attempts. This makes it much harder to centralize the mining power enough to execute a 51% attack. This is especially true if you consider the fact that Monero uses CPUs which are far more expensive for way smaller gains compared to a graphics card. It's extremely
[13:05:55] <AdorableTanuki[m> difficult to scale a CPU mining operation as well compared to a GPU mining operation.
[13:06:01] <kompowiec2__> some type currencies like bitcoin cash, they tried "solve" by breaking backward compatibility, which is a literal reset
[13:06:54] <kompowiec2__> perhaps the only advantage of monero is that it is banned on many exchanges, which makes its value more real
[13:07:18] <kompowiec2__> And not pump
[13:07:42] <kompowiec2__> pumped*
[13:08:52] <kompowiec2__> AdorableTanuki[m: it is not a technical problem, but a society problem. what you can get in return for maintaining the blockchain
[13:10:43] <AdorableTanuki[m> In terms of Monero, you can setup your node to be used publicly in exchange for a fee. You get paid for people using it because it costs them a little extra, but that then incentivizes them to run their own node to avoid that extra fee. The simple goal is to get everyone to run their own node.
[13:12:19] <kompowiec2__> i.e. transaction commission. Bitcoin mining is slowly coming to an end and somehow I don't see it
[13:12:31] <AdorableTanuki[m> When you consider the fact that a pruned blockchain that has existed for 7 years is only 35GB in size, you begin to realize that it's far more practical than some may think. Almost everyone I know would be okay with storing 35GB of files since most people have hundreds of gigabytes that are completely unused.

[13:19:49] <kompowiec2__> IMO the whole blockchain idea is flawed.
[13:20:04] <AdorableTanuki[m> That can't ever happen unless there is somehow a 51% attack.  A 51% attack on the network would be extremely hard since scaling a CPU-based mining operation is rather costly and not very efficient. Mining pools themselves have a rather useful feature that lets them mine blocks based on their local node, not the mining pool. Due to this feature, even if a mining pool has 60%+ of the network it may not be able to do a 51% attack.
[13:21:46] <AdorableTanuki[m> There are many flaws but there are also many solutions. Fiat has many flaws as well but those seem to be ignored by most people.
[13:22:40] <kompowiec2__> 51% problem where the network is large is not essential. it is done naturally on its own. China currently have about 70% BTC blockchain. Some players had to voluntarily reduce their share, so that the currency can still live

[13:24:31] <kompowiec2__> often people tell me they don't use silver or gold because Can't be easily split like cash
[13:25:08] <AdorableTanuki[m> A 51% attack becomes impossible as more miners start mining blocks based off of what their local node is telling them since, at that point, even if a pool had over 80% of the network hashrate they would be unable to execute a 51% attack. Everyone is using their own node which all deny the existence of what the pool tried telling them, therefore negating it entirely.
[13:25:45] <AdorableTanuki[m> Monero doesn't have that solution to my knowledge so 51% attacks on that network become far easier.
