[01:18:00] <bpalmer> it's sending that pointer over the channel.

[01:20:34] <fizzie> (Not that a `range` loop is the only way to read from a channel or anything, the tour explains the others.)
[01:22:20] <Tach> fizzie OK  but that is just a called function, is a Channel something special ?
[01:22:43] <fizzie> Tach: The channel is passed as a parameter to the function.
[01:23:00] <fizzie> Tach: From line 42 of main.go in your first paste.
[01:25:53] <fizzie> The `ch` parameter in the function is the same channel as the `createChannel` in main. The `for container := range ch { ... }` loop is reading (or "receiving") the values those other places (main, and ufwhandler.Sync) are writing (or "sending") to it.

[03:40:54] <mrus> to the same *index*?
[03:41:33] <bpalmer> also, it matters : are these "pointers" to "items in a slice" or "pointers to items" in a slice?
[03:41:58] <KirkMcDonald> Is the slice []*T or []T, in other words.
[03:41:59] <bpalmer> Sounds like Kirk and I parsed it differently.
[03:42:05] <mrus> so what I'm doing is, I'm building that slice []items and meanwhile I'm building a hashtable (basically a map[string]*item)
[03:42:19] <mrus> then I run the sort on []items
[03:42:21] <KirkMcDonald> You may want it to be []*items
[03:42:34] *** Joins: anticw (~anticw@157-131-153-146.fiber.dynamic.sonic.net)
[03:43:20] <KirkMcDonald> But if you take the address of a slice index operation, you are getting a pointer to that specific index of the slice.
[03:43:24] <bpalmer> mrus: if the slice is []items, then when sorting, each object will be mutated.
[03:43:37] <bpalmer> mrus: your pointers aren't messed up, but the values they're pointing at will be changed.
[03:43:55] <KirkMcDonald> Sorting the slice just assigns values in the slice from one index to another.
[03:44:07] <mrus> I see
[03:44:13] <mrus> thank you, that helped me a ton
[03:44:27] <bpalmer> the code will be something like if less(i, j) { s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i] }
[03:44:31] <mrus> so basically either first sort and then hashmap or use []*items

[03:45:08] <bpalmer> Oops

[05:36:58] <vt> s/why/what/
[05:39:15] <bpalmer> `header[:]` creates a slice that uses the array `header` as its backing array. Cast isn't quite the right way to think about it.

[05:40:54] <vt> so better to make a slice in the first place. My thinking was that this header is fixed-size, small and very short-lived (and will not leave the function scope) and the function is called in a loop, so I would have prefered not allocating something into the heap and keep it on the stack.
[05:41:04] <bpalmer> similarly, you could do header[1:4] to create a slice from the array header that has length 4 and capacity 15
[05:42:12] <vt> but maybe I make a false assumption that make() allocates on the heap always. If the compiler sees that both the slice struct and the backing array (the data itself) doesn't leave the function scope, it will just do it on the stack.

[08:50:15] <ac5tin> is it possible to create a slice using composition, for example  mylist := make([]ball,0)    mylist = append(mylist,football{})
[08:50:30] <ac5tin> where in this case football is a struct that embeds ball
[08:53:31] <b0nn> https://go.dev/play/p/br26fKFmD7C
[08:59:39] <ac5tin> seems like it's possible if i make the the slice with type of the interface instead of the base type
[09:00:21] <b0nn> Dp you understand the difference between an interface and a "base type"
[09:00:54] <ac5tin> i have a base type that embeds that interface, and then i have another type that embeds the base type
[09:01:50] <b0nn> Suggest you look at this https://go.dev/tour/methods/9
[09:02:08] <ac5tin> so say i have an interface Bouncer and a base type Ball, i have different types like Basketball, Football, Baseball that embeds Ball, and i want to create a slice that loops through these different balls
[09:02:39] <b0nn> It sounds to me like you have interface{} which everything implements
[09:03:42] <ac5tin> does it only work if all my types implements all the functions in the interface
[09:04:06] <b0nn> Yes
[09:04:43] <ac5tin> is it possible to have only my base type implement all the functions of tht interface, and then my other types like Basketball, Football implement one or two functions and then fallback to the one from the base Ball struct?
[09:05:10] <b0nn> TIAS
[09:05:35] <ac5tin> so if i have an interface Bouncer which needs function A, function B and function C,  my Ball struct implements all A,B,C  functions, and i have Football that embeds Ball but only implements function B, would that not work?
[09:06:25] <LiENUS> man is it just me or is go like the ideal language to write something like cups in
[09:07:56] <ac5tin> b0nn: cuz if i try to do that and create a slice, it tells me im missing some methods

[09:27:41] <bancroft> I'm trying to unmarshal csv which is in [][]string format using a few different libraries (gocarina/gocsv, encoding/csv, jszwec/csvutil) but either i'm not doing it right (highly possible) or just doesn't work. I have something really ugly that works, can someone help me understand the proper way to unmarshal? https://bpa.st/K3QQ
[09:29:55] <bpalmer> ac5tin: it would work as you're describing (if it doesn't, show a test case), but it's misleading to think about embedding like you would inheritance
[09:32:05] <bpalmer> bancroft: can you turn that into a runnable test case for, e.g., the go playground? Instead of taking some command's output, just create a strings.Reader with a hardcoded string (presumably using newlines)
[09:32:51] <bancroft> bpalmer: i'll try

[09:50:04] <bpalmer> bancroft: ok. also, to make sure: have you looked at the package documentation for encoding/csv ? In particular, the Reader.ReadAll example?

[09:56:37] <bancroft> and every time I read the word marshal I think US Marshal lol
[09:58:16] <bancroft> wait maybe I mixed up the terms again. unmarshall is whenn you go from a [][]string to a struct?
[09:58:56] <bpalmer> bancroft: usually Unmarshal is bytes -> T   (where T is some type, like a struct), and Marshal is T -> bytes for some type T
[09:59:28] <bpalmer> so I thought you were having issues with the reading in the CSV at all
[10:01:25] <bancroft> ooh, no, I mean I did many hours ago but finally got that. I'm still working on it and i'm asking for help here because i'm very much stuck, tried other libs and I'm probably using them wrong but ... yeah, I don't know. The Scan's are ugly, but also I don't like using an array index either (e.g., something_important = line[6])
[10:02:01] <bancroft> i'm sure there must be a better way
[10:03:29] <bpalmer> bancroft: gocvs seems to have a nice API, but your basic approach doesn't seem bad. I'd probably move all the scans into a method on the struct
[10:05:39] <bancroft> bpalmer: "move all the scans into a method on the struct" I didn't know I could put a method on a struct, eh... yeah
[10:06:28] <bancroft> but that doesn't really get rid of the type conversion hackery i'm doing to make the structs
[10:10:04] <bpalmer> Yeah. That's just part and parcel of dealing with converting from a file to a real type
[10:10:36] <bpalmer> you either do it yourself, or you let the library handle it for you; the standard csv reader is particularly simple

[10:27:08] <bpalmer> although by convention, Gpu should be written as GPU , probably.
[10:27:50] <ac5tin> is there a way to make a slice for a list of structs that all embed the same base struct
[10:28:35] <seebs> no
[10:28:37] <bpalmer> ac5tin: you can create a slice for some interface that all those structs happen to implement.
[10:28:41] <seebs> a slice has to be of things of the same type
[10:28:54] <seebs> yeah, but that will imply distinct allocations for each of those objects, etc
[10:28:59] <seebs> you can't have them actually be stored in the slice
[10:29:01] <bpalmer> ac5tin: whether a struct embeds a type or creates methods itself that do the delegation is the business of that struct.
[10:29:13] <bpalmer> ac5tin: embedding is *not* inheritance.
[10:29:43] <ac5tin> seebs: if i have an interface Bouncer with func A,B,C, and i have a base struct Ball that implements all A,B,C,  i then have Football, Basketball, Baseball that embeds Ball, is there a way to create a slice of Balls where i can put Football, Baseball, Basketball inside
[10:29:57] <seebs> no
[10:30:08] <ac5tin> so that's only possible in OOP languages?
[10:30:16] <seebs> approximately, yeah
[10:30:38] <bpalmer> well, []Bouncer{Football{}, Baseball{}, Basketball{}} should work just fine.
[10:30:52] <seebs> the actual behavior you get and when you get it can vary, but for the most part, they're doing that by having the things all be fat pointers that know what they're pointing to and its type and store the type separately at runtime
[10:31:01] <seebs> which is what you get in Go with a slice of *interfaces*.
[10:31:31] <seebs> But you can't do it with the ball struct, because if you extract the embedded Ball from a Football, you now have a Ball *that is not in any way connected to or aware of the struct it was extracted from*.
[10:31:39] <seebs> It's just a standalone item of that type now.
[10:32:04] <seebs> This is both a strength and a weakness. On the whole I like it better and find it easier to work with, and basically, if you want interfaces you know where to find them.
[10:32:04] <bpalmer> ac5tin: but again, that's because each of Football , Baseball, and Basketball presumably define a Bounce() method -- whether that's because they embed Ball or not, you can't specify.
[10:32:25] <seebs> Slices of concrete types are good for *not* having that indirection and overhead.

[10:33:06] <ac5tin> im trying to have Ball implement the whole interface (func A, B and func C) then have Football embed Ball and only implement func B, and use Ball's implementation of B and C as the fallback
[10:33:30] <bpalmer> Sure, that will basically work, but it's not inheritance.
[10:33:32] <seebs> it can do that, but it will probably not do what you want
[10:33:55] <seebs> in particular: if it is using Ball's implementation of C as a fallback, then when it does that, *only* the embedded Ball is being passed to that method as the receiver.
[10:34:05] <seebs> It is *not* receiving an object that can be converted back to a Football later.
[10:34:39] <seebs> This makes life a lot simpler but it does prevent doing the fancy Inheritance Tricks that are so common in C++.
[10:34:45] <ac5tin> right, so it's calling the embedding struct to execute their own implementation of the function , and it's not actually Football that's executing the function
[10:34:51] <seebs> Yup.
[10:35:16] <seebs> And this is why we have short compile times and lower method call costs and also don't have inheritance.

[13:24:53] <mickey8> why am i getting assignment to nil pointer? i have o := map[string]map[string]float64{} and then o[file][target] = res
[13:25:34] <bookworm> you need to init the inner map
[13:25:53] <bookworm> same as the outer one you need to call make first
[13:26:27] <mickey8> can i do that in one line? feels weird to have them on separate lines
[13:26:30] <bookworm> no
[13:26:35] <bookworm> welcome to go
[13:26:40] <mickey8> o/
[13:27:28] <bookworm> you anyway need to check if the map already exists and shoving an if else on a single line 7s awful
[13:27:32] <bookworm> is*
[13:28:03] <mickey8> check if the map already exists? what?
[13:28:42] <bookworm> you access the outer map with some key, that may either return nil or a map, depending whether you've seen that key before or not
[13:29:15] <bookworm> so if you want to add something else to the inner map you can't just blindly create the map every time, you'd overwrite what's already there
[13:29:30] <bookworm> meaning you need to check 7f you need to init the inner map or not
[13:29:42] <mickey8> yeah im not worried, because it's for a loop of files, so i can safely assume there's no duplicates
[13:30:10] <mickey8> thanks for the heads up.

[17:04:49] <ivche> wym ran out of file handles?
[17:04:49] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> It only opens one file directly at run time and all other interaction with the file system is through the http and mysql libraries.
[17:05:22] <ivche> do u release the resources properly?
[17:06:51] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> "too many open files"
[17:07:11] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> I defer the closure of the MySQL connections after each opening.

[17:08:24] <ivche> are u sure that the defer actually takes action?
[17:08:42] <ivche> does the function exit properly?
[17:10:14] <fizzie> You might look at what file descriptors it's still got open when it's running smoothly (/proc/<pid>/fd/* symlinks on Linux, `lsof -p <pid>` slightly more portably), though of course that doesn't help if it's a case of running out of them quickly due to some bug, rather than slowly leaking them over time.
[17:11:42] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> It's leaking them over a period of weeks,.

[17:13:53] <ivche> I mean if it's in a request handler, it can be a case of running out of them due to a bug
[17:14:02] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> Yeah, it is a request handler.
[17:14:06] <ivche> but being slow as a result of request frequency
[17:16:08] <ivche> You can do some sort of a stress test, where you request until it runs out of handles
[17:16:28] <ivche> And find the bug that way
