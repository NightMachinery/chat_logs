[21:08:26] <moldorcoder7> i si tpossible in css to say i want the background to be transparent but show not the parent element but the one before (parent of parent)
[21:09:10] <entuland> moldorcoder7, not sure I see the difficulty here - if the parent is transparent, the grandparent will be visible

[21:10:00] <entuland> transparent doesn't mean "show the parent" - it means "show anything that's rendered behind, whatever the reason it's rendered behind"
[21:10:25] <moldorcoder7> entuland, i have a div with a blurred/ matted like bacground , on it i have a  div with a border and on it some text, i want ot bacground of the text to be transparent but show the first div , not the border of the parent

[21:10:48] <entuland> sorry, I have hard time understanding that - can you put a minimal sample in a jsfiddle?
[21:10:56] <moldorcoder7> and is it possible to skip 1 ? and say show everything skipping one element
[21:11:00] <moldorcoder7> sure
[21:12:36] <entuland> that bit about "skipping one" seems tough if not impossible, off the top of my head
[21:13:28] <entuland> it's more likely that you'll have to rethink your design or make use of proper z-indexing, assuming it fits at all
[21:19:33] <moldorcoder7> entuland, like this : https://jsfiddle.net/wjykpa21/33/
[21:19:47] <moldorcoder7> how can i have the title bacground to disply green
[21:19:55] <moldorcoder7> and not showing the border of the parent

[21:20:28] <moldorcoder7> without the white bacground i mean : https://jsfiddle.net/u86fhpqe/
[21:20:40] <entuland> you can make the background transparent but the border behind can't be clipped
[21:20:54] <entuland> you have to find a way to avoid rendering the border behind that

[21:21:30] <moldorcoder7> there is no way to say background = show_top
[21:21:33] <entuland> I may have a fiddle with a similar technique around, hang on
[21:21:38] <entuland> no, there is no way to do that
[21:21:42] <moldorcoder7> ha ok thanks
[21:22:27] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/4wL15bge/3/
[21:22:51] <entuland> you actually need to render those borders separately somehow
[21:23:01] <entuland> the above is one technique using pseudo elements
[21:24:56] <moldorcoder7> entuland, ho nice , works , big thanks i would never have found that myself

[22:40:17] <DPA> Another possibility may be to cut out the same area on the parent element by carefully setting clip-path on the parent element.
[22:56:38] <entuland_> uhm... wouldn't the clip pat cut out anything falling within that range even if it's in a descendant?
[22:56:55] <entuland_> oh well, maybe creating a new stacking context on the children would solve that
