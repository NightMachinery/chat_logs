[00:00:09] <DeeJayh_> Namarrgon: nope, I found the package in the AUR and was going off pure intuition and instinct
[00:00:12] <MacGyver> Huh.
[00:00:26] <MacGyver> Did duckduckgo change their !arch bang to be !aw and not package search?
[00:00:35] <DeeJayh_> I'd say I got pretty damn far for not using a wikipage, but I will go look for that now and try following it.
[00:00:37] <MacGyver> Or is my memory failing me and was this always the case?

[00:02:49] <DeeJayh_> Honestly, the wiki page doesn't say anything either.
[00:03:01] <DeeJayh_> I've never used the AUR before, but I'm assuming that makepkg isn't the last step
[00:03:12] <Namarrgon> it can be if you tell it to install the package
[00:03:35] <Namarrgon> i just checked and the wiki does tell you how to install the package
[00:03:36] <DeeJayh_> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Microsoft_fonts
[00:03:37] <phrik> Title: Microsoft fonts - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[00:03:41] <DeeJayh_> this is what I'm following

[00:03:45] <phrik> Paste short snippets (up to 3 lines) in channel. Please do NOT use pastebin.com or paste.ubuntu.com -- some good, sane paste services are http://ix.io, https://paste.rs, https://bpaste.net and https://gist.github.com. See !ix or !rs for an easy way to paste from a pipe.
[00:03:49] <DeeJayh_> am I looking at the wrong thing?

[06:59:15] <thurstylark> at least for me :P
[07:00:35] <mefistofeles> haha
[07:00:44] <mefistofeles> installing arch is the worst part of arch, imho :P
[07:03:09] <thurstylark> eh, I'd debate that, but that's because I benefit from the flexibility more than the convenience an installer provides
[07:03:32] <thurstylark> although archinstall is lookin' real nice so far :D
[07:04:17] <mefistofeles> I haven't tried archinstall, tbh
[07:04:51] <kevr> archinstall isn't bad
[07:05:01] <kevr> it did start out pretty screwed up, but they addressed the issues quickly.
[07:05:07] <kevr> now i use it often!
[07:05:33] <kevr> responsive devs++
[07:05:33] <mefistofeles> nice

[07:05:58] <thurstylark> I feel like any arch installer that has a chance of being adopted into the install iso in an official capacity would probably have a similar history :P

[07:07:33] <thurstylark> still broken *in the current release

[09:30:43] <horseface_> how do i have it so that it displays thumbnails of webp files?
[09:31:42] <demonicmaniac> you'll need to be more specific as to "what" should display thumbnails
[09:32:10] <horseface_> oh never mind...
[09:32:16] <demonicmaniac> it depends on the filemanager/application in question whether it supports webp format for thumbnail generation
[09:32:16] <horseface_> i seem to have FOUND a solution.
[09:32:28] <horseface_> now i see if it works, one moment, please, kind sir.
[09:32:30] <demonicmaniac> and potential plugins offering webp support if they don't have it builtin
[09:33:05] <horseface_> yes it works.
[09:33:06] <horseface_> :-)
[09:33:08] <horseface_> ty anyway...
[09:33:11] <horseface_> it required...
[09:33:12] <horseface_> webp-pixbuf-loader
[09:33:21] <demonicmaniac> !next
[09:33:21] <phrik> Another satisfied customer! NEXT!
[09:33:25] <horseface_> :-D

[15:16:52] <MacGyver> mrenkey: The problem with an open architecture is comparable to the problem of running open source as a service.
[15:16:55] <Foxboron> It's one issue pointing out the flaws. You are argueing with a shallow understanding of the issues :p

[15:24:13] <LiaoTao> MacGyver, Compromising any part of your internal configuration isn't very good for plausible deniability
[15:24:22] <heythere221> My real issue is the need of anonimity on the connected network and my username already compromises it if broadcasted in any form. You're right its stupid to set a security-sensitive username...
[15:24:22] <LiaoTao> At the very least it aids in fingerprinting
[15:24:50] <MacGyver> LiaoTao: I'll happily get into a discussion of how plausible deniability as understood by many tech people usually isn't, but I have a meeting in five minutes so that'll have to wait.
[15:24:53] <heythere221> Does usermod -l change my username everywhere? or do I have to reinstall arch to be sure?
[15:25:28] <MacGyver> heythere221: I'd be much more worried about what your connection establishment itself leaks.
[15:25:44] <LiaoTao> MacGyver, Okay but I'd rather not get fingerprinted than get fingerprinted. Maybe you assumed too much about the purpose of the question?
[15:26:30] <MacGyver> LiaoTao: No, I assumed precisely the right amount -- their username probably isn't leaking, but all the other stuff is.

[15:28:00] <birkoff> the livecds I try to load always complain about not not finding root device/ no root= parameter 
[15:28:40] <heythere221> I'm not in any danger in case my real identity would be exposed. If so I'd use tails or similar diatros. I just don't want the network admin to know my "real name"...

[23:06:56] <remanifest> Hoping to get some community input on something I'm wondering about. I wrote a script for easily connecting to, and disconnecting from VPN connections using openvpn3. It's not doing anything fancy - just simplifying the process, but it does so in a way that I think is unobtrusive and which makes handling disconnection easier to deal with. Does it make sense to publish something like this on the AUR, or just leave it in a git repo?

[23:37:49] <jcbjoe2021> What is the pacman command to list files that sent part of arch that where installed from another source? I know it’s -Q something
[23:38:02] <jcbjoe2021> Not files but packages
[23:38:06] <NetSysFire> -Qm?
[23:38:19] <jcbjoe2021> Ok thanks

[23:42:29] <jcbjoe2021> Basically I have a Mac computer and I can dial boot Linux on it. I had a full install of arch. Built in camera didn’t work so I went to Ubuntu. I miss Pac-Man and all that Pac-Man can do so I want to try arch in a virtual machine and learn the in’s ands outs of pacman
[23:43:04] <NetSysFire> fun fact: theres pacman-static in the aur but dunno if that works on mac
[23:43:06] <NetSysFire> probably not
