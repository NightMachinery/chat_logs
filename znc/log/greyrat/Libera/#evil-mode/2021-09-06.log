[21:14:38] <Guest36> Hi. Do you have any thoughts using relative or visual for display line numbers type? Ideally it would be possible to have the behavior of the visual setting but having each continuation line not counting as a separate line. As this is an emacs issue and not in the scope of evil package, I was wondering which setting you use.
[21:15:21] <wasamasa> no line numbers besides a tiny modeline indicator
[21:18:06] <Guest36> Thanks very much for responding. Are you aware of the t or copy ex command from vim? I use this in emacs from evil mode as well, but it does not seem to respect line numbers when using the 'visual' setting. This command is useful for long-range copying or moving lines. For example, if you're on line 5, you could do `10,15t .` to copy lines 10 to 15
[21:18:07] <Guest36> to  the line below the current line
[21:18:20] <Guest36> How would you accomplish something like that without line numbers with evil mode?
[21:19:39] <Guest36> Sorry, what I meant was, the issue happens when there are continuation lines. Using the 'visual' mode displays each continuation line as a separate line but evil mode does not count the continuation lines as separate lines
[21:29:35] <wasamasa> I don't use line commands at all
[21:33:29] <Guest36> Ok. Thank you. :)
