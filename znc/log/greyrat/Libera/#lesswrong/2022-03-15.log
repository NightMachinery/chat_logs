[03:10:39] <gwern> hm... maybe single click could do the hover-swap on the current element? then one has a chance to stop or explicitly click on a revealed link

[03:11:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> One "has a chance to stop" *in the middle of a double-click*??
[03:11:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Come on man
[03:11:42] <gwern> a double-click could do nothing with the link. a single click could expose it, then another single click actually visit te link
[03:11:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, this is going to confuse the absolute hell out of people, frustrate, etc.
[03:12:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a recipe for a stream of "wtf is happening with this fucking page" comments
[03:12:53] <gwern> so if I am in reader mode and I double/triple click, I get the selection; if I carefully single click, which currently does... nothing? at least if it has focus already, which it always would in reader-mode, then it harmlessly reveals the link, and then I can single-click it explicitly now that the link is 'enabled'
[03:13:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who is going to "carefully" single-click on random things when they can't even see what is the link and what is not
[03:14:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you propose this handles adjacent words which are different links
[03:14:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you account for all the weird things that operating systems do with click timings and "gestures" and how they interact with browser events
[03:14:56] <gwern> either do each word separately or hover-swap the entire parent block element so a click reveals the paragraph or list item
[03:15:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[03:15:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Causing reflow? Again bringing back the issues that caused us to abandon the hover-swap idea?
[03:15:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern this breaks all discoverability UX principles etc.
[03:15:51] <gwern> at least it only reflows a little bit! most of the time the rest of the page wouldn't even reflow because it'd just move the end of the line
[03:16:17] <gwern> but whatever, you are convinced they should not be clickable at all and the reader should just toggle reader-mode and this does sound like it'd bring up a lot of issues (how would one even decide what is a single click if one is waiting for a possible double/triple click?)
[03:16:32] <gwern> not worth it at this point. just disable the links

[03:19:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But a question for when you feel like diving into analytics: what if you weight by time spent on the site, then what % is mobile)
[03:23:52] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: over the past 5 days, 59% of users are desktop at 00:01:29 session duration; 'mobile' is 39% at 00:01:36, and 2% tablet at 00:01:15

[03:31:34] <gwern> (seems like the percentage has been fairly constant for a while now. I wonder if this is the final equilibrium or if old desktop users are just going to gradually fade out and 30 years from now it'll be like 90% mobile and then 10% powerusers/pros/gamers)
[03:32:14] <gwern> (50:50 is just a very oddly neat ratio for it to be. I can't think why you would expect that)
[03:39:42] <gwern> https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-164730290955385.png this doesn't show an explicit ratio or percentage, but there was definitely a mobile trend up to around 2019, where for a bit mobile exceeded 50% noticeably, but then fell back to under desktop
[03:39:43] <Robomot> image/png (1673x306; 40 KB)
[03:41:11] <gwern> my best guess is that a change in audience composition is masking an underlying mobile trend. the 2020 spike is my GPT-3 writeup which was very popular, in the popular sense, and that spiked mobile. I've been writing relatively little since then, and mostly on especially arcane topics, and so that falls back to a hard core of gwern.net readers who are much more desktop/laptop
[03:42:05] <gwern> should I write something which goes enduringly viral among a much more general audience, more like my silk road guide than /Clippy, the mobile ratio should spike to more like 60-70%, I'd guess
[03:42:52] <two2thehead> gwern, ah. gwern.net stats
[03:42:58] <gwern> you can see in the gpt-3 spike, mobile hit 98:48 ratio or 67%, and that's still a pretty geeky topic
[03:43:00] <two2thehead> I was wondering where you got them from
[03:43:30] <gwern> (so tack on another 2 years of mobile-ization and a broader population, and 67% should be easily beatable)
[03:43:53] <gwern> tldr definitely can't neglect mobile design, annoyingly, since it really is the majority of expected readers now
[03:44:05] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: does that answer your underlying question?
[03:45:23] <saturn2> how does desktop/mobile vary between pages?
[03:45:37] <saturn2> what's the most desktop page and the most mobile page?
[03:46:06] <gwern> you would be getting into very small sample sizes for most of that
[03:46:52] <gwern> also, temporal confound: more recently written pages must have more mobile percentage
[03:49:42] <Ralith> clearly we need to further popularize gwern.net so as to improve statistical sample sizes
[03:50:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yeah it does, thanks
[03:51:03] <two2thehead> ah, by the fact that later means more odds of mobile readership
[03:51:23] <gwern> yes. an old article, back when almost all readers were desktop, will be permanently skewed high-desktop
[03:52:01] <gwern> plus, I expect that the ratio would only just serve as a correlate of ultra-nerd vs general audience
[03:52:29] <gwern> if you were asking questions like "what pages could use a rewrite to be more mobile-friendly and improve traffic/experience", may not be too helpful

[07:48:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, that Dan Luu article
[07:48:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "For example, in my social circles, there have been two waves of people migrating from iPhones to Android phones over the past few years. Both waves happened due to Apple PR snafus which caused a lot of people to think that iPhones were terrible at something when, in fact, they were better at that thing than Android phones. Luckily, iPhones aren't strictly superior to Android phones and many people who switched got a device
[07:48:17] <Obormot\Arcturus>  that was better for them because they were previously using an iPhone due to good Apple PR, causing their errors to cancel out."
[07:48:50] <enterprisey> OH also
[07:48:59] <enterprisey> some architectural choices were made due to the influence of VAX VMS
[07:49:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> lolwtf
[07:49:24] <enterprisey> we're still backwards compatible I think
[07:49:47] <enterprisey> oh we're also compatible with an analog computer that implemented matrix multiplication with opamps
[07:49:52] <enterprisey> yeah it's a bit of an older system
[07:50:14] <enterprisey> damn, when I get done with this project (if it doesn't kill me first), the stories I'll have...
[07:51:06] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm wary of chat.sr.ht *because* it is run by Drew DeVault, who doesn't strike me as someone I'd want running any infrastructure I rely on.
[07:51:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "For example, if you observe that it's silly for people to move from Android phones to iPhones because they think that Apple is engaging in nefarious planned obsolescence when Android devices generally become obsolete more quickly, due to a combination of iPhones getting updates for longer and iPhones being faster at every price point they compete at, allowing the phone to be used on bloated sites for longer, you can't really
[07:51:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  make money off of this observation." ... lol
[07:51:36] <enterprisey> I can easily see that viewpoint, PapuaHardyNet, but I personally think it's more reliable than usual
[07:51:43] <quanticle> enterprisey: I know that feeling
[07:51:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Can you say a bit more about that? Why doesn't he seem like someone who should be running infrastructure
[07:51:50] <enterprisey> are your reliability concerns more political or technical?
[07:52:06] <enterprisey> because certainly I see considerable political issues, but not really technical ones
[07:52:27] <quanticle> The feeling of, "Eh, this thing sucks, but the people who made it are politically important, so I can't just tell them that I'm not going to use their framework"
[07:52:32] <PapuaHardyNet> political, obviously. He's ridiculously good at anything technical, but I've seen him interacting with people and I wouldn't want to be dependent on him.
[07:52:32] <quanticle> I had that all the time at Amazon
[07:52:33] <enterprisey> (ok, except for the part where todo.sr.ht displayed comment counts that were off by an order of magnitude, but that's the first actual technical issue I recall from any sourcehut service, ever)
[07:52:35] <saturn2> VMS and analog computers are both cool
[07:52:51] <quanticle> Oddly enough, I had less of that feeling at Microsoft
[07:52:54] <enterprisey> saturn2: until you find yourself using their floating point formats in 20XX...
[07:53:21] <enterprisey> PapuaHardyNet: yeah, I wonder what would happen if I wrote a github-style web frontend to sourcehut and hosted its code on sourcehut :)
[07:53:29] <saturn2> anyway this seems really bad from a resume driven development point of view
[07:53:42] <enterprisey> the infamous gemini favicon issue did nothing for my opinion of him either
[07:53:53] <PapuaHardyNet> heh. gogs is pretty good - I use it for a local git forge where I mirror interesting repositories
[07:54:16] <enterprisey> saturn2: yeah I have no illusions about the resume-driven development angle, but it's a friggin fusion reactor
[07:54:29] <enterprisey> I wouldn't have turned it down if I had to walk over broken glass to get to work
[07:54:35] <enterprisey> (ok, maybe I would've in that case)
[07:54:35] <quanticle> saturn2: And for that reason it also seems really fun!
[07:54:42] <saturn2> yes
[07:55:08] <enterprisey> quanticle: fun for an hour or a side project perhaps, but we're under a wee bit of schedule pressure as well

[07:58:10] <saturn2> very un-awesome
[07:59:10] <enterprisey> VERY high-quality thread thanks for the link
[08:00:19] <ardent[m]> quanticle: "The experience has 'certainly made me question the value of options as a hedge or as an investment if they can just be wiped off the table arbitrarily" something similar but tangent to this has made me question the value of holding a rental home for the purposes of being able to move in if things go sour, since the laws might change to not allow a lease nonrenewal
[08:00:43] <saturn2> seems like this person brought all their problems on themselves by trusting anything invented after 1990
[08:01:08] <ardent[m]> which basically means that kind of hedge isn't open to someone in California unless they are willing to eat the cost of a home in California and also want to remain there (neither of which apply to me in any sufficiently negative situation)
[08:01:23] <PapuaHardyNet> ardent[m]: I assume you live in a place where tenants have stronger legal protections than rentiers?
[08:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> *landlords
[08:01:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "rentier" means something different
[08:01:57] <ardent[m]> Oh I meant more along the lines of investing elsewhere and turnkeying
[08:02:15] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, you are right - rentier means "a person whose money comes from investments and who therefore does not have to work"
[08:02:33] <ardent[m]> (since any place I'd want to be all else equal would require a warm body to keep pipes from freezing)
[08:03:15] <PapuaHardyNet> You don't want to own a home to have an option to move in, because it constrains your options to move around? That's tautological
[08:04:15] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. not tautological exactly, but implied. I believe you can pay people to manage your home for you as you rent it though.

[08:04:43] <quanticle> Specifically, I lol'd at "also a chat app"
[08:06:46] <ardent[m]> "Things go sour" here means things like job situation and/or the economy, and basically the edge that holds for hedging against an economic problem is a lot less than I thought pre-2020, because now I realize I can't underestimate people's willingness to care about others at my expense.
[08:07:23] <ardent[m]> shouldn't underestimate*
[08:07:53] <quanticle> Why would it require a warm body? As long as you're paying the bills to keep the heat on, the pipes won't freeze.
[08:08:18] <ardent[m]> valid I guess, but that also changes the cost greatly
[08:08:25] <ardent[m]> net cost
[08:08:37] <quanticle> True
[08:08:57] <ardent[m]> (and I still have liability, and liability transfer is a must if I'm going to be 2000 miles away from it)
[08:09:17] <ardent[m]> e.g. who pays the fine if the sidewalk isn't shoveled
[08:10:18] <ardent[m]> plus I've also realized over this time I even-more want to avoid a situation where I can choose where to live in any sense other than "you've made it, offices in any company in any location are open to you if you just apply"
[08:11:04] <PapuaHardyNet> You want to *avoid* a situation where you can choose where to live?
[08:13:05] <ardent[m]> I mean I realized just how many things load-beared on going to the office and having that routine, cafeterias, social, etc
[08:13:38] <quanticle> I guess that's the fundamental difference: the past two years have made me realize how few things were being held up by all that.
[08:16:38] <ardent[m]> and I'm not sure how much elasticity there is in "if you want something enough you can have it", but I'd guess it's nonzero if only because the bar gets lowered if "nothing" is not a viable option for non-financial reasons
[08:18:04] <ardent[m]> e.g. random companies who need a dev exist, and cost-center tech isn't something I'd do for the money alone at this stage and certainly not after 3-5 more years of G salary
[08:21:06] <ardent[m]> (though honestly my first fallback in a particularly bad situation involving job/economy would be to ask Epic Systems if they're hiring, they're dogmatically office and it would beat a webshop/cost-center all over the place, weird server language be damned)
[08:21:18] <ardent[m]> (plus I interned there)
[08:22:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "dogmatically office" sounds like hell
[08:23:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't imagine how much I'd have to be paid to take a full-time office job at this point
[08:23:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It'd have to be edging toward seven figures, I think

[09:18:45] <PapuaHardyNet> A week ago I replaced my golang SRS program with `org-fc`, an emacs SRS package. My reason was to be able to add latex into my flashcards.
[09:19:12] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:20:05] <PapuaHardyNet> Unfortunately the result was that my `org-fc` flashcards were less concise and more problematic to review. This was because the extra freedom given to me by the ability to create multiline flashcards with latex allowed me to spend less time optimizing for precise questions and answers.
[09:20:30] <PapuaHardyNet> I've since moved back to `srs-cli`, the golang program.
[09:29:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This problem exists not only for support but also for products a company could buy instead of build. For example, Ben Kuhn, the CTO of Wave, has a Twitter thread about some of the issues we've run into at Wave, with a couple of followups. Ben now believes that one of the big mistakes he made as CTO was not putting much more effort into vendor selection, even when the decision appeared to be a slam dunk, and more strongly
[09:29:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  considering moving many systems to custom in-house versions sooner. Even after selecting the consensus best product in the space from the leading (as in largest and most respected) firm, and using the main offering the company has, the product often not only doesn't work but, by design, can't work." ... what an indictment of our entire civilization this is
[09:30:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "For example, we tried "buy" instead of "build" for a product that syncs data from Postgres to Snowflake. Syncing from Postrgres is the main offering (as in the offering with the most customers) from a leading data sync company, and we found that it would lose data, duplicate data, and corrupt data. After digging into it, it turns out that the product has a design that, among other issues, relies on the data source being able
[09:30:20] <Obormot\Arcturus>  to seek backwards on its changelog. But Postgres throws changelogs away once they're consumed, so the Postgres data source can't support this operation. When their product attempts to do this and the operation fails, we end up with the sync getting "stuck", needing manual intervention from the vendor's operator and/or data loss. Despite being widely recommended and the leading product in the space, the product has a number of
[09:30:20] <Obormot\Arcturus>  major design flaws that mean that it literally cannot work."
[09:30:45] <PapuaHardyNet> Is this the DanLuu article?
[09:31:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> yep
[09:31:22] <PapuaHardyNet> Dan Luu works for Wave now? huh
[09:31:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "... if we think about things from the vendor side of things, there's little incentive to produce working products since the combination of the fog of war plus making false claims about a product working seems to be roughly as good as making a working product (at least until someone like Kyle Kingsbury comes along, which never happens in most industries), and it's much cheaper."
[09:32:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just think about this: our capitalism system, which supposedly is the most efficient resource allocation and progress-generation system that humanity can come up with / evolve / whatever, results in a situation where it's simply more advantageous to make something that is fake and broken, and lie about it, than it is to make a real product that actually works
[09:33:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> And in this case we can't even blame, like, government intervention or anything
[09:33:38] <adiabatic> lots of people end up blaming capitalism itself
[09:33:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no regulatory concerns, no laws
[09:34:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> No government-enforced monopolies or cartels
[09:34:16] <adiabatic> but, like, lots of wreckage can go wrong systemically from people failing to do their homework (see also: buying packages of subprime mortgages)
[09:34:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing preventing anyone from making whatever, like, data sync tool or w/e, that they want, or stopping anyone from buying whatever such tool that they want
[09:35:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or anyone from saying or publishing whatever about such tools
[09:35:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no excuse!
[09:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the paradigmatic maximally free market scenario, and yet it goes so comprehensively wrong that the market leaders are just selling totally broken shit for years and years and years
[09:37:42] <adiabatic> sounds like a special case of "the optimal occurrences of [bad thing] is not zero"
[09:37:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I really, really do not think so
[09:38:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> How could that principle possibly get you to this state of affairs?
[09:38:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> What bad thing is non-optimally zero here?
[09:38:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> An entire product market just being broken?
[09:39:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> One on which a huge swath of firms depend?
[09:39:21] <adiabatic> Sure, the optimal occurrences of a company failing to research everything about a vendor's solution to make sure it actually works as advertised beforehand is not zero
[09:39:29] <quanticle> "Although this is really a topic for another post, I'll note that lack of trust that exists across companies can also hamstring companies when it exists internally. As we discussed previously, a lot of larger scale brokenness also comes out of the cultural expectations within organizations. A specific example of this that leads to pervasive organizational problems is lack of trust within the
[09:39:31] <quanticle> organization. For example, a while back, I was griping to a director that a VP broke a promise and that we were losing a lot of people for similar reasons. The director's response was 'there's no way the VP made a promise'. When I asked for clarification, the clarification was 'unless you get it in a contract, it wasn't a promise', i.e., the rate at which VPs at the company lie is high enough
[09:39:33] <quanticle> that a verbal commitment from a VP is worthless; only a legally binding commitment that allows you to take them to court has any meaning."
[09:39:35] <quanticle> This sounds like Amazon.
[09:39:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: I... don't understand what you mean by that
[09:40:38] <adiabatic> quanticle: sounds like Amazon was able to spin its lack of internal trust into a series of externally-sellable products, which is…a hell of an ass-pull
[09:41:10] <quanticle> Amazon should be thought of less as a single firm, and more as a conglomerate. Only, instead of expanding through acquisitions as most conglomerates do, Amazon expands by setting up new internal mini-firms within itself. Of course, this leads to all the problems of internal politics that conglomerates have, but it's still profitable so w/e
[09:41:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: If all companies need to research to such a degree (it's not like the CTO didn't do research - he did, quite a lot!) to make sure the product they're buying *works, at all*, and isn't designed in such a way that it's *fundamentally broken*, when buying from *the market leader*, i.e. te dominant vendor, used by a plurality of companies...
[09:41:36] <quanticle> adiabatic: Yeah, Steve Yegge's platforms rant goes into that a bit
[09:41:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: ... then that's the market being broken, period
[09:43:29] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: I agree, it's broken. I'm saying it's broken because there are infrequent events where lots of big famous people/organizations fail to do way more homework than usual…and if you find out something horrible, like "this product does not work as advertised", nobody's incentivized to publicize their findings, and, in fact, may be disincentivized because of libel laws or something like that
[09:44:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: But what exactly is "infrequent" in the described case? It's not infrequent at all!
[09:44:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "failing to do way more homework than usual" is in fact ubiquitous by definition!
[09:45:37] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: sorry. maybe 0.1% of all homework tasks, but if the Fortune 1000 (1000 companies, unless I'm super wrong) make 100 decisions like this in a year…well, that gives you a plenty large number (the sort of number you're  pointing at)
[09:46:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> No I mean *what event* is the one you're saying is infrequent?
[09:46:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> *What* is infrequent here?
[09:46:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is it that happens infrequently
[09:46:53] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: "oops, we should've done way more research for this, because our normal levels of research didn't uncover this gaping flaw"
[09:47:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> But Dan Luu's whole point is that this is NOT infrequent
[09:48:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's actually totally commonplace
[09:48:45] <quanticle> ^
[09:49:28] <quanticle> Moreover, the incentive structure of search engines makes it ever more difficult to do the "normal" level of research for pretty much any consumer-facing technology
[09:49:46] <quanticle> Try to use Google to figure what the "best" product is in a category for which you have little domain knowledge
[09:49:49] <quanticle> It's a disaster
[09:50:19] <quanticle> Where "best" means, "Meets my requirements for size, weight, battery life, ease of use, etc"
[09:51:23] <quanticle> I was looking at Kindle reviews, after ggreer praised the Kindle Oasis' page turn speeds. Only one out of the four video reviews I saw even discussed the screen. Literally the most important part of the e-Reader!
[09:53:27] <quanticle> Like instead of mentioning page turn speeds or talking about resolution and how crisp letters are etc, they mention that it has "24 LEDs" in its backlight. Cool. That's good to know.
[09:53:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "For a while, I lived in a city where Amazon used 3rd-party commercial courier services to do last-mile shipping for same-day delivery. The services they used were famous for marking things as delivered without delivering the item for days, making "same day" shipping slower than next day or even two day shipping. Once, I naively contacted Amazon support because my package had been marked as delivered but wasn't delivered.
[09:53:53] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Support, using a standard script supplied to them by Amazon, told me that I should contact them again three days after the package was marked as delivered because couriers often mark packages as delivered without delivering them, but they often deliver the package within a few days. Amazon knew that the courier service they were using didn't really even try to deliver packages4 promptly and the only short-term mitigation
[09:53:53] <Obormot\Arcturus>  available to them was to tell support to tell people that they shouldn't expect that packages have arrived when they've been marked as delivered." ... I ask you, does this sound like a working, healthy civilization? Does it??
[09:54:36] <quanticle> That happened to me as well, only it was FedEx and it was my dad's birthday present.
[09:55:09] <quanticle> And the package wasn't re-delivered in a few days. I had to contact Dell and they had to ship me a new laptop.
[09:55:35] <quanticle> And by the time that all happened, my dad's birthday had long since passed and it was closer to Christmas than it was to his birthday
[09:55:39] <adiabatic> about every other time I contact Verizon Wireless with a support issue I get blatantly lied to
[09:55:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> "At scale, there's no commercial service you can pay for that will reliably attempt to deliver packages. If you want a service that actually works, you're on the hook for building it yourself, just like in the software world. Having to build instead of buy to get reliability is a huge drag on productivity, especially for smaller companies (e.g., it's not possible for small shops that want to compete with Amazon and mail
[09:55:49] <Obormot\Arcturus>  products to customers to have reliable delivery since they can't build out their own delivery service)."
[09:55:53] <adiabatic> like, liar-liar-pants-on-fire lies
[09:55:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> > At scale, there's no commercial service you can pay for that will reliably attempt to deliver packages.
[09:56:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just ponder that statement (which is totally true)
[09:57:56] <quanticle> I think the problem with that statement is "at scale". Like, a 0.5% failure rate may be acceptable for consumers and businesses shipping a few hundred packages. But once you get to e.g. Amazon's scale, then even a moderate error rate leads to literally millions of bad customer experiences.
[09:58:15] <quanticle> And if your response to that is, "And therefore businesses shouldn't scale," yes, I agree
[09:58:40] <adiabatic> no wonder amazon does everything itself
[09:58:57] <adiabatic> they're the MOAR NINZE company.
[09:59:44] <quanticle> Yeah. In a real sense, Amazon is both a confirmation of Coase's theory of the firm and, simultaneously, a total refutation of efficient markets
[10:00:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Like, a 0.5% failure rate may be acceptable for consumers and businesses shipping a few hundred packages." ... no, I think this is not true, and indeed Luu makes the point that this is part of what prevents smaller businesses from competing with Amazon
[10:00:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because, for one thing, the failure rate isn't 0.5%
[10:00:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's more like 75%
[10:01:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And... you really don't need to say anything beyond that, heh
[10:01:35] <quanticle> A 75% failure rate for *certain people* will often be washed out in the numbers and show up as a 0.5% failure rate overall
[10:01:48] <quanticle> Sucks to be you, if you're one of those people, though
[10:03:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah, it's not 0.5% overall
[10:03:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's much higher even on average
[10:03:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> And in any case even 0.5% will be ruinous!
[10:03:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, it's fewer customers in absolute numbers, but if one of those makes trouble for you...
[10:05:19] <ardent[m]> I think >1% of my packages from Amazon have been late... never had a non-delivery though in hundreds of orders
[10:05:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I definitely have
[10:06:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The pervasiveness of decisions like the above, technical decisions made without serious technical consideration, is a major reason that the selection pressure on companies to make good products is so weak. There is some pressure, but it's noisy enough that successful companies often route around making a product that's work, like in the Mongo example from above, where Mongo's decision to loudly repeat demonstrably bogus
[10:06:01] <Obormot\Arcturus>  performance claims and making demonstrably false correctness claims was, from a business standpoint, superior to focusing on actual correctness and performance; by focusing their resources where it mattered for the business, they managed to outcompete companies that made the mistake of devoting serious resources to performance and correctness."
[10:06:09] <ardent[m]> while I did have two non-deliveries (rather, a month late and the circumstances I eventually received the items were unusual) from other places
[10:06:31] <ardent[m]> and this is despite Amazon being the vast majority of my purchases
[10:06:42] <ardent[m]> online purchases of physical items*
[10:07:19] *** Joins: nullcone (uid11626@id-11626.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[10:09:15] <quanticle> I've had probably ~20% of deliveries be late and probably ~1% of deliveries entirely fail to arrive.
[10:09:28] <quanticle> It's one of the reasons I'll be canceling Prime this year
[10:09:57] <quanticle> It's only 2-day shipping if the product actually arrives in two days!
[10:10:30] <ardent[m]> Most of the time I don't notice a single day though unless I particularly wanted the item at a certain time
[10:10:36] <quanticle> "We're sorry, your product is delayed... here's some worthless Amazon Music credit"
[10:10:54] <ardent[m]> oh I've only gotten that email twice or so
[10:11:19] <saturn2> the only time i've had a non-delivery was when rioters were going around setting trucks on fire
[10:11:21] <quanticle> Oh, they don't e-mail. But if you check on your product delivery page, you'll see it if the delivery date was missed.
[10:11:23] <ardent[m]> I'm in the South Bay though and most of my things have 1-day
[10:11:57] <quanticle> saturn2: Amazon Armored Trucks when?
[10:12:07] <saturn2> ikr
[10:12:15] <ardent[m]> lately less though, today ordered a prime shipment that has Thursday as the expected day
[10:15:29] <quanticle> The other thing I've had to be careful of is counterfeits
[10:15:47] <saturn2> watching mongodb take off was probably the most astonishing blackpill i've experienced
[10:15:57] <quanticle> Amazon's UI deliberately obscures who you're *actually* buying from
[10:16:21] <quanticle> And their SKU merging in the warehouse means that even if you're buying from a reputable vendor, sometimes you get a counterfeit anyway
[10:16:50] <spxtr> join me in my resolution to not buy a single thing from amazon this year
[10:16:58] <spxtr> it's.... very difficult
[10:17:08] <quanticle> spxtr: No, because I don't see Target or WalMart as being necessarily better
[10:17:12] <saturn2> why would i do that?
[10:17:15] <quanticle> And if I gave up Amazon, I'd just switch to them
[10:17:37] <quanticle> saturn2: But MongoDB is web scale!!!!!!!
[10:17:50] <saturn2> indeed
[10:49:00] <feep[work]> and this is still better than all alternatives that were attempted!
[10:49:06] <feep[work]> er, I was way scrolled up
[10:49:08] <feep[work]> ignore that
[10:49:52] <quanticle> I'm going to interpret that as you talking about MongoDB and there's nothing you can do about it!!!!
[10:50:02] <feep[work]> oh no, I was talking about capitalism
[10:50:10] <feep[work]> sidenote, redis seems pretty good so far
[10:50:18] <feep[work]> tho it's definitely a "database"
[10:50:35] <feep[work]> ie. their consistency guarantees are "what consistency guarantees"
[10:50:45] <feep[work]> but inside that framework it's pretty solid!
[10:52:16] <synthmeat> feep[work]: tarantool seems to be the bee's knees though, at least on the design aspect. looks a bit haphazardly developed though
[10:53:20] <synthmeat> i'll probably try swapping redis with that this year, front it with nginx. lua goodness all the way.
[10:54:02] <feep[work]> yeah we're kinda trying to not do "well this seems fun, let's just swap it in and try"
[10:54:13] <feep[work]> it's a bit different when you hold customer data
[10:54:39] <synthmeat> well, i do as well :D millions of them!
[10:54:44] <quanticle> I don't think I've ever trusted Redis to persist data
[10:54:46] <feep[work]> aigh fair nuf
[10:54:52] <quanticle> I've always used it as a cache
[10:55:00] <feep[work]> quanticle: what do you use as a backing kv store?
[10:55:03] <quanticle> Or an ephemeral key/value store for e.g. configuration data
[10:55:10] <quanticle> Usually Postgres
[10:55:26] <quanticle> But for config data, that's populated by a startup script
[10:55:27] <feep[work]> yeahhh I guess, not sure if it's optimized for "let's just dump in huge quantities of json blobs"
[10:55:37] <synthmeat> yeah, i keep nothing that's not ephemeral on there. just misc stuff/cache/raping the pubsub
[10:55:58] <feep[work]> is there known problems with redis data loss?
[10:56:58] <synthmeat> is there any db that hasn't had issues ever?
[10:57:07] <feep[work]> known problems in the current version
[10:57:12] <feep[work]> known or suspected
[10:57:14] <adiabatic> synthmeat: postgres?
[10:58:14] <synthmeat> didn't they have some fsync or smth issue relatively recently
[10:59:23] <adiabatic> don't all databases have problems with being lied to by fsync

[10:59:32] <Robomot> Code Review Decision Fatigue - Tyler Cipriani
[11:00:34] <synthmeat> anyways, i think you can get redis to be persistent just fine, if you're willing to trade some performance
[11:01:07] <feep[work]> wellll, you can get it to only lose a second of data
[11:01:13] <feep[work]> wait, hang on you're right
[11:01:16] <feep[work]> flush everything exists
[11:01:43] <feep[work]> appendfsync always
[11:01:54] <feep[work]> tho note the docs call it "very slow"
[11:03:04] <synthmeat> rdb+aof appendfsync always, yeah

[19:08:31] <feep> oh, even on lw :(
[19:08:42] <kuudes> 4th dose seems quite good, but not for the people at most risk, ie elderly
[19:08:44] <gwern> feep: song lyrics might work because they use mostly super generic common rhymes which can be memorized
[19:09:01] <PapuaHardyNet> "I thank the anonymous reviewer for taking the time to comment [...]" love this
[19:09:04] <kuudes> in general it halves infection risk compared to 3 doses, and 1/4 risk for severe illness
[19:09:14] <feep> mhguess
[19:10:01] <kuudes> so not that useful on population level to reduce deaths, as most deaths occur to elderly, but clearly worth the 20 e for the regular working age people
[19:10:29] <feep> gwern: jesus
[19:10:36] <feep> why not just sign it "Summer Glau" while you're at it

[19:11:05] <feep> that is very fair

[19:15:02] <feep> (aka main geeks)
[19:15:19] <feep> sorry, I should be clear, /j
[19:15:22] <pie__> priors show if you are good at computering you are trans
[19:15:37] <pie__> though thats mostly combined with the anime avatar on github
[19:15:57] <pie__> not sure what fancy typography says
[19:16:02] <feep> gay
[19:16:13] <feep> though it depends on the stroke thickness
[19:16:51] <pie__> basically if youre good at anything at this point youre probably neurountypical

[23:00:26] <Robomot> Hamid Ramezanpour (@HamidRamezanpou): "Soon, fMRI will be replaced by ultrasound imaging. While it's cheap, small & noninvasive, it provides good spatial resolution even 4 deep regions. perfect 4 cross species studies to understand the evolutionary biology of functions! Would love to use it to study cortical columns!"
[23:00:29] <Robomot> Neural correlates of blood flow measured by ultrasound: Neuron (Nunez-Elizalde et al. simultaneously measured neural activity with electrodes and / blood flow with functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) in awake mice. Their results / establish that blood flow bears a simple and accurate relationship to local neuronal / firing at frequencies <0.3 Hz and validate fUSI as a tool to infer neural activity.)

[23:03:32] <gurkenglas> I hear that people buy stocks on loaned money and then are contractually obligated to sell when their loss would exceed their credit. Doesn't that imply that some whale could come in and short the stock, triggering that clause and driving the price further down, then close their short position?
[23:04:50] <kuudes> yes
[23:05:01] <kuudes> also the other way around
[23:06:59] <gurkenglas> Is that just waiting to blow up everywhere, or is everyone paying attention to how vulnerable each price is to that attack and calling that by some greek letter
[23:07:45] <kuudes> that is related to why a movie theather chain today announced it has bought part of silver mine etc
[23:07:50] <gwern> bear raids are already illegal
[23:08:16] <gurkenglas> ah yes slap a law on it that'll do it ._.
[23:09:02] <gwern> and of course, if you *know* someone is doing a bear raid, then you want very much to buy the stock
[23:10:50] <gurkenglas> what if you have epsilon evidence that the price should go lower so that is totally why you are shorting
[23:11:36] <gwern> then you can try to convince the judge of your fundamentals market research, and you probably won't profit much if at all on such weak evidence after fees and risk
[23:12:33] <gwern> (the fact that you can exploit a bear raid if you know it's a bear raid also makes bear raids that much harder to organize, like how pump-and-dumps keep collapsing when someone defects)
[23:12:41] <gurkenglas> if you have substantial evidence that two prices should go lower, are you allowed to take that contractual clause into account when deciding which to short?
[23:12:44] <gwern> (the cancer gets cancer etc)
[23:15:12] <gurkenglas> it seems to me that the sane way to do this is that instead of that contractual clause you require them to buy a put option that bounds their loss to their credit
