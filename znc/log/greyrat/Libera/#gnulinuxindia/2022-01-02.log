[12:33:47] <labrador> Ankit[m]12, you have 12 irc nicks lol
[12:34:41] <labrador> It does seem a lil weird tho. No one on IRC :(
[12:34:52] <labrador> Mostly bridges
[12:37:41] <Arya[m]> nopes
[12:38:01] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr pystardust and void00r are there
[12:38:34] <Arya[m]> damn relejek isnt active at all nowadays
[12:38:36] <Ankit[m]12> labrador: Nicks?
[12:39:41] <labrador> nicknames
[12:39:53] <labrador> Its in irc
[12:39:57] <labrador> I am from irc
[12:40:05] <labrador> your matrix room is bridged with irc
[12:40:12] <labrador> Thats why I can talk to you
[12:40:23] <labrador> I see some telegram bridges here too
[12:40:39] <Arya[m]> you can dm matrix users like me
[12:40:44] <labrador> nope
[12:40:49] <labrador> Only channels
[12:40:51] <Arya[m]> but you cant dm telegram userse who are bridged via matrix
[12:41:01] <Arya[m]> Ankit is on telegram
[12:41:15] <labrador> Can i pm you? Thats cool,never knew you could huh
[12:42:40] <Arya[m]> yup
[12:44:40] <labrador> Thats just so cool huh,one community over so many platforms
[12:44:48] <labrador> Some of them proprietary tho :(
[12:45:07] <Arya[m]> the commmunity was originally only on telegram
[12:45:18] <labrador> Ohhh
[12:45:21] <labrador> makes sense
[12:45:22] <Arya[m]> so we have it
[12:45:32] <labrador> I was questioning too why would indians use irc
[12:45:39] <labrador> but its a nice place
[12:46:15] <labrador> Maybe some of you would like to use irc too. We have #linux and #gnu on libera too
[12:47:47] <Arya[m]> i can join irc stuff with matrix
[12:47:58] <Arya[m]> i am in a couple irc rooms from matrix
[12:48:09] <Arya[m]> #git #sway #openbsd #emacs #emacsconf
[12:53:54] <labrador> Oh nice
[12:57:51] <labrador> you use emacs?
[12:57:56] <labrador> What dstro you use?
[12:59:06] <Arya[m]> arch
[12:59:19] <labrador> ohhhh
[12:59:20] <labrador> nice
[12:59:24] <Arya[m]> for emacs i use doom
[12:59:26] <Arya[m]> but actually its really really customized and doesnt use evil
[12:59:52] <labrador> de?
[13:00:00] <Arya[m]> swaywm
[13:00:52] <labrador> Nice
[13:00:56] <labrador> I am a noob tho
[13:01:02] <labrador> I just use debian/kde
[13:01:18] <Arya[m]> oh nice
[13:01:28] <Arya[m]> try xfce
[13:03:05] <labrador> I'm not brave enough to do that. I did once with gnome and spent three hours reversing it.
[13:03:22] <labrador> Because debian and its metapackages
[13:06:35] <Arya[m]> oh
[13:06:40] <labrador> Are you a programmer or smthn?
[13:06:44] <Arya[m]> snapshots are your friend :)
[13:06:48] <Arya[m]> labrador: nopes
[13:06:59] <labrador> Well if debian used btrfs then maybe
[13:07:10] <labrador> Arya[m], oh ok
[13:09:08] <Arya[m]> you can make it do it ryt
[13:09:23] <labrador> No my ext4 drive cannot
[13:09:27] <labrador> Atleast not easily
[13:09:32] <labrador> What fs do you use?
[13:09:49] <Arya[m]> btrfs usually
[13:09:59] <labrador> noice
[13:10:02] <Arya[m]> but on my latest install i didnt have time so ext4
[13:10:08] <Arya[m]> endeavour has snapshots on ext4
[13:10:12] <labrador> Man I like the customazibility of arch
[13:10:33] <Arya[m]> i think they use timeshift
[13:10:49] <labrador> secure+ encrypted boot + zfs + openrc(so probs artix) + i3 would be so nice
[13:10:56] <labrador> Would have to learn a lot tho
[13:12:17] <Arya[m]> and moreover zfs takes up a whole bunch of ram
[13:12:18] <Arya[m]> zfs would be weird
[13:12:18] <Arya[m]> from what i have heard
[13:12:38] <labrador> ZFS is the epitome of filesystems
[13:13:10] <labrador> Ugh I just want that corruption protection,that arc cache
[13:13:17] <Arya[m]> do you really have a use for it
[13:13:18] <labrador> Yea it does use a lot of ram
[13:13:22] <Arya[m]> just use btrfs or xfs
[13:13:25] <labrador> Arya[m], no not really
[13:13:42] <labrador> xfs is not a normal os too
[13:13:45] <labrador> fs*
[13:13:55] <labrador> its for parallel reads
[13:13:56] <Arya[m]> xfs is pretty popular
[13:14:00] <Arya[m]> especially in unixy circles
[13:14:06] <Arya[m]> its like ext4 from what i have seen
[13:14:06] <labrador> But pc's dont really need it
[13:14:13] <Arya[m]> but has more features
[13:14:16] <Arya[m]> and stable
[13:14:20] <Arya[m]> unlike btrfs
[13:14:21] <labrador> Yeah with its corruption being like ext4 too
[13:14:43] <labrador> Its a simpler fs than either btrfs or zfs,but more than ext4
[13:14:50] <labrador> Btrfs is basically a toned down zfs
[13:14:53] <labrador> As I see it
[13:15:19] <Arya[m]> yeah
[13:23:05] <labrador> I'd love to but I did the stupid thing when I installed debian ie no seperate partition for /home
[13:23:16] <labrador> So if I nuke it and install arch
[13:23:22] <labrador> My data goes away too
[13:24:27] <Arya[m]> back it up ?
[13:24:56] <labrador> No disk large enough to do that
[13:24:56] <Arya[m]> https://distro.tube/articles/move-your-home-folder-to-second-drive.html
[13:24:59] <Arya[m]> do something like this
[13:24:59] <labrador> :(
[13:25:02] <Arya[m]> resize the disk
[13:25:13] <Arya[m]> delete unnecessary files
[13:25:19] <Arya[m]> gpg encrypt and upload to cloud ?
[13:25:19] <labrador> Huh resizing partitions is risky but I could try
[13:25:33] <labrador> I only use like 150 of my 1024 gb
[13:25:37] <labrador> could do
[13:25:54] <labrador> Arya[m], do I look like a richfuck to you?
[13:26:04] <labrador> i got no money
[13:26:59] <Arya[m]> isnt there free ones
[13:27:12] <Arya[m]> google gives 15 gigs ryt
[13:27:23] <Arya[m]> maybe i am underestimating how much data you have
[13:27:50] <labrador> Haha I would stay on debian than use google. But yeah I'll try partition size reduction and try to install arch
[13:28:02] <labrador> Maybe I'll be an archer like you soon :)
[13:28:03] <Arya[m]> gpg encrypt it
[13:50:16] <Arya[m]> lol

[14:35:17] <Zbnssn[m]> be a man, read the man
[14:37:57] <labrador> I actually did know its forcing. Its just that there is no need of forcing regularly

[14:55:22] <gtlsgamr> Irc is good enough as it is
[14:55:28] <securearth> Who said you to encrypt
[14:55:29] <labrador> I am pretty new yeah. Joined 4 days ago
[14:55:33] <securearth> Keep it unencrypted
[14:55:42] <labrador> Matrix is bloated
[14:55:59] <gtlsgamr> securearth: no one did, but many communities use encryption and I don't like the whole downloading and decryption and shit
[14:56:19] <gtlsgamr> Matrix is good, but not my taste
[14:56:31] <MohdAariz[m]> i can install arch my own way then

[16:12:16] <telegram_9978079> NeoVoid[m]: Meme channel
[16:14:07] <labrador> why do you write names like that <Neo Void> instead of the normal NeoVoid[m]?
[16:18:09] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: ?
[16:18:30] <NeoVoid[m]> This is me writing from telegram.
[16:18:43] <labrador> ohh
[16:20:09] * VoidSoul[m] This is me writing from matrix.
[16:21:06] <voidsoul> This is me writing from IRC.
[16:21:37] <labrador> you can use /me from matrix too?
[16:21:43] <labrador> nice
[16:22:27] <VoidSoul[m]> labrador: /me agrees.
[16:23:15] * VoidSoul[m] In ement i could just type "e" and it automatically send me to emote mode.
[16:24:02] * labrador is suprised
[16:27:12] <Arya[m]> <securearth> "Nice" <- gomuks
[16:28:42] <Arya[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Matrix is good, but not my taste" <- i replied to wrong message. i meant this
[16:29:05] <gtlsgamr> What do you mean gomuks
[16:29:34] <Arya[m]> its cli matrix client
[16:29:37] <Arya[m]> works really nicely
[16:29:44] <Arya[m]> everything is a /command
[16:30:37] <gtlsgamr> I think you misunderstood my tastes. I don't like complications. CLI is optional. IRC is just simple, only text, no bullshit
[16:30:42] <gtlsgamr> that's why I like it. 
[16:30:43] <labrador> irc-like
[16:30:44] <labrador> nice
[16:30:59] <gtlsgamr> do one thing and do it well
[16:31:00] <Arya[m]> even gomuks is text only
[16:31:03] <Arya[m]> very irc like interface
[16:41:51] <VoidSoul[m]> arya can you help me with org-roam installation?

[16:44:02] * VoidSoul[m] yes use-package org-roam with ensure t
[16:44:19] * Arya[m] then it should work
[16:44:24] <VoidSoul[m]> thats the instruction from his video and site
[16:44:31] <Arya[m]> try rm -rf .emacs.d/elpa
[16:44:42] <Arya[m]> or wherever te files are stored
[16:44:53] <Arya[m]> iirc i got the issue sometimes
[16:45:06] <Arya[m]> its been a while since i used package so idk

[17:30:55] <aryak> I was trying to setup pihole on alpine lmao
[17:30:59] <labrador> Also have you registered and verified on libera yet?
[17:31:02] <aryak> i found a fork that worked on alpine 
[17:31:06] <labrador> you should do so
[17:31:06] <aryak> labrador: nopes
[17:31:12] <aryak> i think i have a really old one
[17:31:19] <labrador> you don't need cloaking tho
[17:31:24] <labrador> you already on znc
[17:31:24] <aryak> cloaking?
[17:31:34] <labrador> See irc is an ooooooold
[17:31:38] <labrador> protocol
[17:31:56] <labrador> So old infact that the first users were western students at uni
[17:31:58] <gtlsgamr> labrador: you seem like you've been on irc since long
[17:32:07] <aryak> got it
[17:32:09] <labrador> gtlsgamr, no,its been 4 days
[17:32:13] <aryak> i had this same username
[17:32:15] <labrador> I just read voraciously
[17:32:21] <aryak> labrador: noice
[17:32:24] <gtlsgamr> Yes I can see that
[17:32:43] <labrador> aryak, so the structure of the name you use signified that
[17:32:54] <labrador> nickname!username@hostname
[17:33:06] <aryak> labrador: which client are you using
[17:33:09] <labrador> username and hosname would be on a uni computer
[17:33:39] <labrador> But most computers don't have a hostname,so irc uses ip addresses instead
[17:33:50] <labrador> you can see how  thats a bad idea
[17:34:03] <labrador> so cloaking is made to hide the hostname
[17:34:07] <aryak> how to know if i am verified?
[17:34:12] <labrador> do /whois labrador
[17:34:23] <labrador> aryak, /whois aryak
[17:34:31] <labrador> or /msg nickserv help
[17:34:57] <aryak> nothing happens for me
[17:35:04] <aryak> for any of the commands
[17:35:16] <labrador> hmm thats weird
[17:35:29] <labrador> what are you typing?

[18:09:34] <Hello[m]> Btw background 👌
[18:09:49] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: that was a nice read. Attention span are shrinking badly. You nee layout is sickkk
[18:09:54] <pystardust> Your new*
[18:10:37] <labrador> >I would like to state at this point that I am in no way, a “tik-tok hater”
[18:10:48] <labrador> tfw I WOULD say I am a tik tok hater
[18:11:02] <labrador> And man your website is rad
[18:11:14] <gtlsgamr> Hello[m]: What background?
[18:11:17] <aryak> labrador: same
[18:11:23] <labrador> Its as simplistic as https://motherfuckingwebsite.com
[18:11:26] <labrador> nice
[18:11:30] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: Thanks a lot for that! The layout is def worth it.
[18:11:47] <aryak> gtlsgamr: share your irssi config?
[18:11:56] <gtlsgamr> labrador: pystardust: It is https://susam.github.io/spcss/ with some modifications
[18:12:13] <pystardust> ahhh, time to steal css :P
[18:12:19] <gtlsgamr> haha XD
[18:12:20] <aryak> xD
[18:13:13] <Hello[m]> gtlsgamr: Oh my bad I was dark theme on other browser I thought you kept dark background.
[18:13:43] <labrador> yeah gtlsgamr thats the only thing bad
[18:13:50] <labrador> No dark mode :(
[18:14:04] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: so I was thinking, no one likes using the web when there are cli alternatives to stuff. And every cli scraper is almost the same and the only difference is the scraper. So wouldn't it be nice to have a single cli that is extensible with any sort of a website
[18:14:38] <gtlsgamr> labrador: Hello[m]: There is dark mode. It is activated based on browser preference.
[18:14:46] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: I don't understand
[18:14:53] <gtlsgamr> could you clarify?
[18:15:19] <labrador> yeah gtlsgamr, I use tor. Unfortunately tor would not set a browser preference for dark mode.
[18:15:27] <gtlsgamr> tor is based on ff right?
[18:15:29] <labrador> Too trackable
[18:15:35] <gtlsgamr> ah
[18:15:36] <gtlsgamr> got it
[18:15:49] <labrador> gtlsgamr, yeah. But thanks atleast for not explicitly bllocking tor
[18:16:03] <gtlsgamr> why you use tor for normal browsing though? Its like using a SWAT van for roaming in the city
[18:16:05] <labrador> Thats very good for those of us who want privacy
[18:16:14] <Hello[m]> I use duckduckgo dark theme so it adapts
[18:16:23] <pystardust> basically something like a browser from the command line that will get you content from anysite
[18:16:24] <labrador> gtlsgamr, I don't wanna leak to my isp that I know you
[18:16:42] <labrador> Thats why as my dns reguests go to my isp
[18:16:47] <labrador> On my phones tho
[18:16:49] <Govindas[m]> I use Tor for normal browsing too, it's normal these days with how privacy unrespecting many websites are
[18:16:53] <labrador> They goto libredns
[18:16:57] <labrador> Im just too lazy
[18:16:57] <gtlsgamr> um.. okay I guess? If you use tor for normal browsing, doesn't it help narrow down your profile? Can't you just use VPN for that?

[18:17:04] <Ankit[m]12> @AryaSucks2021 have a look at this
[18:17:20] <Govindas[m]> gtlsgamr: VPN is easier to track than Tor
[18:17:21] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: I think that would be VERY hard
[18:17:26] <Govindas[m]> and VPN often costs money
[18:17:31] <pystardust> Do you guys thing websties logging ip are not respecting privacy?
[18:17:37] <labrador> pystardust, basically lynx?
[18:17:41] <labrador> go search for it
[18:17:59] <Ankit[m]12> Ankit[m]12: why the dot is so small? it's a document written in org mode
[18:18:23] <gtlsgamr> considering the fact that MOST website use a hell of a lot of javascript to dynamically manipulate the DOM, I suppose it will cause a lot of problems in getting content.
[18:18:26] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: 
[18:18:28] <Govindas[m]> with a VPN they'll see oh it's an IP from ProtonVPN, how many people use that?
[18:18:28] <Govindas[m]> with Tor: oh it's an IP from Tor, that is widely used, hard to know who this person is
[18:18:42] <labrador> Tor is nice yeah
[18:18:44] <pystardust> labrador: nah, something like, a place where you can get anything, like anime, movies, videos, manga, but all united in a neat interface. Something where contributing is simple and anyone can build a scraper for a side and add it to it
[18:18:49] <Arya[m]> Ankit[m]12: the font or the unicode char is the issue
[18:19:26] <gtlsgamr> Ah! pystardust so you mean like a HUB for scrapers?
[18:19:46] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: most of your ips are actually not a big deal, cause we have an ip swap, even if someone knows our ip they won't be able to trace us down cause it will change and it is shared xd
[18:19:53] <gtlsgamr> I think we might be moving into *illegal* territory here.
[18:19:54] <labrador> pystardust, gopher?
[18:20:10] <labrador> gtlsgamr, scraping is not illegal
[18:20:10] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: yes like a HUB for scrapers
[18:20:14] <pystardust> xd
[18:20:27] <gtlsgamr> Yes, labrador the same way torrents are *legal*
[18:20:29] <pystardust> owning copyrighted material is technically is
[18:20:31] <Ankit[m]12> Arya[m]: font is ok, I'm thinking about unicode, which unicode font do u use?
[18:20:32] <gtlsgamr> we only use it for linux isos.
[18:20:35] <gtlsgamr> :)
[18:20:54] <labrador> gtlsgamr, also vpns won't protect use from browser fingerprinting
[18:21:02] <labrador> Also dont tell me u use chrome
[18:21:12] <Arya[m]> Ankit[m]12: ttf-joypixels or noto
[18:21:14] <Govindas[m]> vpns may sell your data :)
[18:21:15] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: same
[18:21:36] <gtlsgamr> labrador: No my question is, suppose you use tor right? And you use it to access normal websites. Doesn't that make it easier to fingerprint you?
[18:21:37] <pystardust> labrador: i was a big chromium user, just switched to firefox, and the websites load so slow, i think it resolves dns with a lot of caution
[18:21:38] <Govindas[m]> and vpns often don't have as wide multi platform support as Tor has
[18:21:59] <pystardust> use your own vpn, i use my server's vpn XD
[18:22:08] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: Yeah I switched a few days ago too. Just for a fresh change. The DPI support is incredible compared to chromium
[18:22:11] <Govindas[m]> gtlsgamr: most tor users visit normal websites, that's the point of it
[18:22:48] <gtlsgamr> Govindas[m]: labrador: I am not very informed on this topic. I will have to do some research and respond. I suggest we end it here for now and then we can continue when I have read some.
[18:22:52] <labrador> gtlsgamr, no,go to panopticlick.eff.org with your normal browser. The more bits,the more trackable. Cause it does not matter the site knows im using tor,cause it does not know who 'i' am
[18:22:55] <labrador> got it?
[18:23:01] <labrador> tor comes in at 11 bits
[18:23:18] <Ankit[m]12> pystardust: doesn't it defeats the main idea behind VPN?
[18:23:33] <labrador> Tor bounces connections over three relays
[18:23:37] <Govindas[m]> I recommend using Tails for no fingerprinting with Tor, just Tor Browser helps a lot, but not fully
[18:23:48] <labrador> Govindas[m], or gnu/linux
[18:23:53] <labrador> but deffo no windows
[18:24:00] <labrador> or winshit as i call it
[18:24:00] <gtlsgamr> Other that that, I am working on #100daystooffload / means just make a post everyday for 100 days. Any length, any topic. One post per day. I am on day 3. Hope to see you some more people join as well.
[18:24:05] <Govindas[m]> yes windows not private
[18:24:11] <pystardust> Ankit[m]12: they will know my server's ip, but not mine, but im not fully anonymous due to my vps provider
[18:26:47] <gtlsgamr> I have 17 bits Govindas[m] 
[18:26:56] <labrador> gtlsgamr, compared to 11
[18:26:59] <labrador> of tor
[18:27:12] <labrador> Tor stands for the onion routing network
[18:27:14] <Arya[m]> Govindas: what OS do you use for matrix server
[18:27:16] <gtlsgamr> But idk tor sounds too "paranoid" for just being privacy conscious. 
[18:27:17] <Arya[m]> ubuntu server?
[18:27:33] <gtlsgamr> It is upto you guys. 
[18:27:39] <labrador> gtlsgamr, the more people use tor. The more private the poeple who needs to be are
[18:27:41] <Arya[m]> same
[18:27:43] <Tor[m]> labrador: The Onion Routing 
[18:27:49] <labrador> hey tor
[18:27:52] <labrador> nice name
[18:27:53] <Govindas[m]> Arya[m]: yes
[18:27:59] <Arya[m]> ok
[18:28:16] <Tor[m]> labrador: More people use me better the privacy
[18:28:21] <labrador> yes
[18:28:23] <labrador> indeed
[18:28:33] <Govindas[m]> gtlsgamr: I thought the same, but got used to using it daily for many months and it's pretty fine 
[18:28:47] <labrador> Because the relays will get more and more shuffled traffic making it harder to sniff around
[18:28:48] <Govindas[m]> just cloudflare is biggest annoyance
[18:29:03] <Arya[m]> Govindas[m]: yeah
[18:29:05] <Tor[m]> Just don't login to anything
[18:29:05] <labrador> Govindas[m], fuck cloudflare imo
[18:29:09] <labrador> yeah
[18:29:19] <labrador> Thats something I forgot to say
[18:29:30] <Govindas[m]> I use cloudflare, but only when I actually need it, I dislike people who use it when they aren't being attacked or anything
[18:29:33] <Tor[m]> Govindas[m]: Bigger threat than MANGA
[18:29:53] <labrador> I remember it as being FAANG
[18:30:08] <Tor[m]> labrador: Meta
[18:30:23] <labrador> Tor[m], fakebook
[18:30:35] <labrador> A namechange wont let em escape
[18:30:45] <labrador> From the consequences of their actions
[18:30:53] <gtlsgamr> Sometimes I feel like we all are Winston Smiths and no matter what we do, Big brother is going to catch up to us either way.
[18:31:00] <Govindas[m]> it's ok to login into stuff when on Tor if you make the accounts anonymous and then don't do anything else on that session 
[18:31:13] <Tor[m]> labrador: Bhai bohot gussa aa raha hai
[18:31:28] <labrador> gtlsgamr, true that as in the end,winston loved big brother
[18:31:53] <gtlsgamr> and in the end, no matter what he did. however hard he tried, he reached nowhere
[18:31:59] <labrador> lmaoo
[18:32:00] <gtlsgamr> they are always there.
[18:32:02] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: we are
[18:32:13] <gtlsgamr> We are winston smiths :(
[18:32:29] <labrador> I want a julie too tho :(?
[18:32:39] <labrador> I think i wrote the girls name wrong
[18:32:45] <gtlsgamr> julia
[18:32:49] <labrador> Yeh
[18:33:05] <Tor[m]> labrador: Brave new world is the book u need to read
[18:33:40] <labrador> Tor[m], yeah I haven't read it yet
[18:33:59] <Tor[m]> Wait
[18:34:31] <gtlsgamr> I am gonna legally download that book and read it.
[18:34:32] * gtlsgamr winks
[18:34:42] <pystardust> don't spoil books pls
[18:34:48] <gtlsgamr> oh fuck
[18:34:49] <gtlsgamr> sorry
[18:34:50] <gtlsgamr> shit
[18:35:15] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: i have a hard copy
[18:35:18] <Arya[m]> half way into the book
[18:35:34] <gtlsgamr> I use google play books
[18:36:13] <gtlsgamr> http://0x0.st/osUD.png
[18:36:48] <Tor[m]> https://archive.org/details/ost-english-brave_new_world_aldous_huxley
[18:36:49] <labrador> gtlsgamr, really?
[18:36:54] <gtlsgamr> yep
[18:36:54] <labrador> please no google
[18:36:56] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Use archive
[18:37:04] <gtlsgamr> archive has mobile app?
[18:37:12] <gtlsgamr> I think you got it wrong.
[18:37:23] <Tor[m]> Bugs kidhar hai
[18:37:29] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: I don't know
[18:37:32] <gtlsgamr> I *legally* download 😉  and then upload Gplay books to read. The interface is good.
[18:37:38] <gtlsgamr> so I am reading archive books.
[18:37:54] <Tor[m]> Use something Foss
[18:38:03] <labrador> Tor[m], FREE SOFTWARE
[18:38:07] <gtlsgamr> I don't think there is such an alternative
[18:38:09] <labrador> use calibre or something
[18:38:22] <labrador> Its dev is indian too
[18:42:58] <Tor[m]> @gtlsgamr how are mangoes
[18:43:19] <labrador> mangoes are off season
[18:43:21] <gtlsgamr> They are still little
[18:43:27] <gtlsgamr> growing
[18:43:28] <labrador> lmao yea
[18:43:36] <gtlsgamr> will have fruit in 3 or 4 years
[18:43:47] <gtlsgamr> anyway bye all! see you soon i guess
[18:43:51] <Tor[m]> Flowers are coming
[18:44:39] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Have very old tree in front of my house gives mangoes every 2/3 years
[18:45:16] <labrador> gtlsgamr, bye
[18:50:20] <JB[m]> <pystardust> "securearth: i think i know the..." <- @pystardust  hi im facing some issue with znc 
[18:50:20] <JB[m]> U use telegram ?
[18:50:42] <bugswriter> bugs yaha hai @Tor ? 
[18:50:47] <bugswriter> bc tag kese karte hai
[18:50:55] <bugswriter> telegram walo ko
[18:51:12] <bugswriter> ALSO guys. I am thinking about expanding our Indian Linux Community.
[18:51:35] <JB[m]> bugswriter: Tab complete
[18:51:38] <labrador> nice idea bugswriter? But who are you
[18:51:49] <bugswriter> we need more Indians into Linux. Our site is not ready
[18:52:02] <bugswriter> well I had this idea @labrador 
[18:52:16] <bugswriter> I mean you all can do what you are doing. but I want to add fun. without fun people don't come
[18:52:34] <bugswriter> how about .. nerd memes?
[18:52:44] <bugswriter> competitions .. I mean memes go viral and .. this is a good way to attract people
[18:52:57] <bugswriter> not just meme but cool edits.
[18:53:15] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: Profile me jane ka aur mention aayega (for fluffy chat)
[18:53:32] <bugswriter> I am on IRC
[18:53:38] <labrador> Ik
[18:54:08] <bugswriter> I decided to compromise. you guys don't have to .. keep using irc , I will use it too. But that's just Suraj Kushwah. not bugswriter
[18:54:09] <Tor[m]> > <@t0r:denshi.org> > <@bugswriter:libera.chat> telegram walo ko
[18:54:09] <Tor[m]> >

[18:54:09] <Tor[m]> Tap on three vertical dots
[18:54:42] <bugswriter> I want to PROMOTE Linux in Indian youth
[18:54:47] <bugswriter> I will do it. I am ready. 
[18:55:08] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: That's the spirit
[18:55:23] <Tor[m]> Bhai aur songs chahiye toh bol
[18:55:24] <Tor[m]> Bugs
[18:56:10] <Govindas[m]> waiting for the day when someone telling that they're using Windows will be very unusual
[18:56:29] <Tor[m]> Govindas[m]: Ye i don't think so
[18:56:36] <labrador> bugswriter, I am using IRC because I like it lol
[18:56:44] <Tor[m]> Bank of baroda uses internet explorer
[18:56:48] <labrador> Everyone should like irc
[18:57:06] <labrador> Tor[m], and they don't get haxxed every other second?
[18:57:16] <bugswriter> USE IRC. But I am talking about noobs who have potential to move to FOSS and Linux
[18:58:05] <Tor[m]> labrador: Ha padh ne me aur reality me dekhne me.baat alag hai
[18:58:21] <Tor[m]> Itna kharab opsec hai ki kya bolne ka
[18:59:41] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: I think bugs can be a "Good linux utuber"
[18:59:58] <Arya[m]> Govindas[m]: thats like saying the year of the linux desktop is real
[19:00:05] <Tor[m]> Mainstream
[19:00:15] <Arya[m]> Tor[m]: lmao
[19:01:21] <Arya[m]> #freesoftware:matrix.org is pretty nice ig
[19:01:53] <bugswriter> bugs can be a "Good Linux Youtuber" - Tor (2022) 
[19:04:19] <labrador> bugswriter, free software
[19:04:28] <labrador> fuck open source software
[19:05:05] <Tor[m]> bugswriter: Bugs can be Indian mental outlaw - @t0r:denshi.org
[19:05:43] *** Joins: ramram (~ramram@106.79.192.95)
[19:06:07] <Tor[m]> ramram ji
[19:06:24] <ramram> i need a phone which one should i buy any suggestions?
[19:06:55] <Tor[m]> ramram: Pixel 4a (good for 2/3 years) and flash graphene 
[19:07:10] <Tor[m]> Using it for 3 months feels good
[19:08:14] <Tor[m]> ramram: Republic day par sale aayega tabhi kharid lena 
[19:08:30] <Tor[m]> If <25,000
[19:08:44] <Arya[m]> Tor[m]: yes
[19:09:04] <ramram> Tor[m]: ok, but why did you choose google ?
[19:09:18] <Arya[m]> second hand pixel is great idea
[19:09:19] <Tor[m]> Bhai agar budget kam hai toh use micromax is good
[19:09:29] <Tor[m]> ramram: Ha that's the fun part
[19:09:29] <labrador> Because graphene only supports pixel
[19:09:38] <labrador> Tor[m], lmao micromax
[19:09:53] <labrador> Use xiomi if budget less.
[19:10:01] <bugswriter> http://0x0.st/os0-.mp4
[19:10:05] <Tor[m]> Cause degoogling is best in Google's phone (HTC)
[19:10:19] <Tor[m]> labrador: Bhai china ko paisa kyu deneka
[19:10:28] <labrador> And also vomit up some data while unlocking bootloader to our leader Xing Xong
[19:10:55] <Tor[m]> root karna hai toh use China
[19:10:58] <labrador> Tor[m], what do you think pixels are assembled in USA?
[19:11:02] <Arya[m]> labrador: yeah
[19:11:09] <labrador> Na rooting is easier on pixels
[19:11:10] <ramram> motorola socha m?
[19:11:11] <Tor[m]> labrador: Vietnam 
[19:11:15] <labrador> lmao
[19:11:16] <Arya[m]> labrador: they are nsa spyware
[19:11:24] <Tor[m]> ramram: Ha accha hai
[19:11:28] <Arya[m]> ccp spyware < nsa spyware
[19:11:37] <Arya[m]> Tor[m]: old ones were gr8 tbh
[19:11:41] <Arya[m]> when it was google
[19:12:00] <labrador> Ok see you should root your phone too ramram 
[19:12:10] <labrador> Because freedom is very important
[19:12:17] <labrador> And root gives you true freedom
[19:12:34] <labrador> Otherwise its a jail
[19:12:42] <Tor[m]> labrador: Phone ka security kam ho jayega 
[19:12:43] <labrador> read more at gnu.org/philosophy
[19:12:46] <Tor[m]> Though
[19:13:05] <labrador> Tor[m], Selinux policies still exist
[19:13:08] <Tor[m]> So threat model ke hisab se phone leneka
[19:13:15] <labrador> Freedom does not lower security at all
[19:13:44] <labrador> Also look into #fdroid on oftc ramram 
[19:14:32] <ramram> labrador: philosophically it does lower security
[19:18:08] <labrador> technically does not
[19:19:01] <Tor[m]> labrador: Ha but operational security kam ho jata hai na 
[19:20:04] <labrador> Only for evil maid attacks,and only if you're somebody a nation state is attacking
[19:20:10] <labrador> Normally nope
[19:20:21] <labrador> For a normal guy,no loss in security
[19:20:27] <labrador> A lot of increase in freedom

[19:23:02] <Tor[m]> labrador: Risk reward ratio is good but khali advice deneka ki bhai security kam ho raha hai
[19:23:31] <Tor[m]> Advice -> mention 
[19:23:32] <labrador> yeah thats true
[19:24:18] <Tor[m]> @ramram Bhai tum bolo
[19:24:33] <labrador> I think he's gone lmao
[19:25:44] <ramram> labrador: why did you agree with tor so quickly, have a debate on this, you are the one who gets manipulated quickly
[19:25:47] <ramram> learn from bugs
[19:26:08] <Tor[m]> Bas yaar
[19:26:12] <Tor[m]> Jhagda mat karo
[19:26:35] <bugswriter> what is happening? 
[19:26:49] <Tor[m]> Kuch nahi bhai
[19:26:58] <Tor[m]> Tum next video ka socho
[19:27:13] <bugswriter> are mereko bus thora context dedo 
[19:27:17] <bugswriter> he said learn from bugs
[19:27:23] <bugswriter> so I wanna know please Tor give me some masala
[19:27:48] <Tor[m]> <ramram> "i need a phone which one..." <- .
[19:28:01] <Tor[m]> Kuch nahi
[19:28:19] <Tor[m]> Bas thoda baat chit hua ki kya options hai
[19:28:55] <labrador> ramram, there is nothin for debate lmao. I agree that users should be plainly told what they are getting into
[19:29:03] <Tor[m]> Using stock android flashing graphene (if he buys pixel ) or he buys chinses phone root it
[19:29:04] <labrador> And make their own decisions
[19:29:12] <ramram> bugswriter: ye labradoor bhai bola freedom se security kam nahi hoti, tor bhai bola hoti hai, tor ne labra bhai mana liya. these are weak people bois bugs don't get manipulated so quickly
[19:29:30] <Tor[m]> labrador: Threat modeling and stuff
[19:29:33] <labrador> Or third option is to get pixel and root it
[19:29:37] <labrador> Tor[m], yeah
[19:29:48] <labrador> Maybe you are a secret spy journalist lmaoo
[19:29:56] <labrador> Then you do need graphene
[19:30:14] <labrador> Governments will send physical people against you
[19:30:32] <Tor[m]> labrador: Bhai root nahi karna hota for graphene 
[19:31:54] <Tor[m]> labrador: Mereko warranty void nahi karna tha + good camera and stock android experience and lightweight phone And promoting and using floss 
[19:32:57] <labrador> Tor[m], First graphene can deffo be rooted,just that it will nullify its secure boot. Also root does not void your warranty. And its not floss
[19:33:01] <labrador> Free software
[19:34:44] <Tor[m]> labrador: But for installing graphene os u don't need to root it 
[19:34:51] <Tor[m]> Bhai sabhi public toh hai
[19:35:46] <bugswriter> @ramram I think kis context mai baat chal rahi hai wo bhi to pata hona cahiye. 
[19:37:08] <Tor[m]> Poora type kar ie @ ramram:libera.chat
[19:37:25] <labrador> no?
[19:37:30] <labrador> you just need to say
[19:37:32] <labrador> ramram, 
[19:37:37] <labrador> Thats it
[19:37:37] <Tor[m]> And no space like @ramram
[19:37:37] <bugswriter> ramram
[19:37:40] <bugswriter> oh wow
[19:37:42] <bugswriter> that's cool
[19:37:45] <bugswriter> ramram
[19:37:46] <bugswriter> ramram
[19:37:48] <bugswriter> I like this
[19:37:53] <bugswriter> this is ramram
[19:37:56] <Tor[m]> Bhai aisa nahi
[19:38:00] <labrador> bugswriter, you did not know about this?
[19:38:01] <bugswriter> it just work as first word
[19:38:02] <labrador> lmao
[19:38:05] <bugswriter> ramram: ok I got it
[19:38:09] <bugswriter> how to tag it's cool and easy
[19:38:15] <bugswriter> no .. 
[19:38:19] <bugswriter> I just realized tis
[19:38:20] <bugswriter> this*
[19:38:27] <bugswriter> I am new to IRC
[19:38:29] <Tor[m]> Kar pehle
[19:38:34] <labrador> There's no tagging in irc,this is just a feature implemented by most clients
[19:38:42] <labrador> As you know
[19:38:48] <labrador> irc doesnt have any standard
[19:38:49] <labrador> at all
[19:38:58] <labrador> It just has several defacto standards
[19:39:20] <bugswriter> also freedom se security .. ka koi lena dena nahi hai software ke. .usse dekhe. otherwise .. londa aadhi raat ko ghume ye uski freedom hai ..usko koi pakad ke utha le ke jaaye. ye uski security hai.
[19:39:33] <ramram> whenever bugswriter thinks he is losing it, he changes the topic. DON'T DEBATE WITH HIM, it is frustating
[19:40:29] <bugswriter> ramram: my ex used to say this -> You are a big manupilator. this is how I convinced all my friends to use Linux
[19:42:18] <labrador> bugswriter, that is wrong
[19:42:21] <ramram> look guys how easily he said it even concluded it freedom se security ka koi lena dena nahi hai
[19:42:22] <labrador> very very wrong
[19:42:48] <bugswriter> I said ki context batao
[19:42:53] <Tor[m]> labrador: Yes you are
[19:43:20] <bugswriter> hawa mai thori security aur freedom mila sakte ho .. in real world. to wese .. freedom badne se secrurity risk badhta hi hai.

[19:43:25] <bugswriter> this is not the case
[19:43:33] <labrador> Freedom and security are both important. After all can't have freedom without security. Don't really have freedom if a cracker gets in and encrypts your files !
