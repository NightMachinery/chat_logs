[12:45:27] <ns12> Is this the official IRC channel for F#?
[13:09:42] <MatthiasVance> ns12: No, this is an unofficial channel.
[13:09:47] <MatthiasVance> ns12: Same as the #csharp one
[14:25:33] <biberu> welcome ns12 o/

[18:05:45] <ns12> MatthiasVance: Noted. It's rather empty in here. Was it the same on Freenode?
[18:05:59] <ns12> biberu: Thanks.
[18:06:40] <MatthiasVance> ns12: It think it might actually be faring better than on freenode :P It shows how the .NET user base is rather C# centric.
[18:06:49] <MatthiasVance> Silly Microsoft!
[18:09:21] <biberu> yeah, i think there's more chatting than on fn
[18:13:17] <ns12> MatthiasVance: I come from Linux/Unix and OCaml. I am exploring F#. I noticed that there are two kinds of F# available on Linux. One that is related to "Mono" (e.g. Ubuntu: https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/fsharp FreeBSD: https://www.freshports.org/lang/fsharp) and the other one related to ".NET Core SDK" (as mentioed at
[18:13:17] <ns12> https://fsharp.org/use/linux/). What is the difference?
[18:13:42] <ns12> I am new to Microsoft-land, so I have no idea about these things.
[18:14:13] <MatthiasVance> ns12: Mono existed before the current .NET. Microsoft had a Windows-only ".NET Framework" until version 4.8 and then they went back to the drawing board with a new ".NET Core". Now, after a few years they have just released ".NET 6".
[18:14:28] <MatthiasVance> Mono is still a separate runtime, but I would advise to just use .NET 6
[18:15:06] <ns12> MatthiasVance: In other words, I should follow the instructions at https://fsharp.org/use/linux/ ?
[18:15:32] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[18:16:19] <ns12> Thanks. I'll probably be back with more questions :)
[18:20:27] <biberu> is mono still active?
[18:26:14] <ns12> biberu: Looking at https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/fsharp https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/fsharp https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/fsharp it appears that fsharp is stuck at the same version across three Ubuntu LTS versions.
[18:28:43] <ns12> What will I miss out on if I use the fsharp provided by my Linux distribution instead of the .NET Core SDK provided by Microsoft?
[18:35:49] <ns12> I wonder why the C# channel has secret mode (+s).
[18:38:35] <biberu> ns12: i haven't used mono so can't really say, but if that's f# 4 there's been two major versions of the language since then, and i wonder if it's compatible with libraries developed for the newest runtime
[18:41:23] <biberu> ns12: i also don't know how much material / active community there is around mono, but i'd guess there's more help to get with dotnet, and learning the latest versions might be beneficial if you're doing this for general learning
