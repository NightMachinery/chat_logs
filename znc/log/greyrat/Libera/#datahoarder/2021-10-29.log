[01:39:12] <evilgohan2> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, STEP BRO?!
[01:40:39] <joepie91> https://u.pixie.town/pixie.town/l9ZxYyoNO0JtSdxmmVUsk9Ah/IMG_20211028_232705.jpg
[01:40:48] <joepie91> okay, after some benchies, I can definitely recommend GST3D filament :p
[01:41:00] <sarnold> cute little boats :)
[01:41:08] <joepie91> also the material strength is ridiculous for a PLA
[01:41:17] <joepie91> I needed pliers to break apart the house on the low-res benchy
[01:41:27] <joepie91> couldn't do it with my fingers
[01:41:42] <joepie91> I normally don't have issues breaking apart such PLA prints...
[01:41:50] <joepie91> sarnold: they're the de facto benchmark for 3D printing :p
[01:41:56] <joepie91> a torture test of sorts
[01:42:04] <sarnold> joepie91: today's teacup? :)
[01:42:12] <sarnold> oh crud. it was a tea kettle.
[01:42:13] <joepie91> ?
[01:42:16] <joepie91> oh
[01:42:20] <joepie91> not quite :p
[01:42:33] <joepie91> the benchy is designed specifically to test a bunch of difficult geometries
[01:42:39] <joepie91> that printers often have trouble with
[01:42:54] <joepie91> the only one my printer really has issues with is the rounded overhang
[01:43:16] <joepie91> so for a manually-levelled, budget 3D printer with half-price filament, this constitutes "passed with flying colors" :p
[01:46:37] <evilgohan2> aww look at the cute wittle wships
[01:47:35] <joepie91> also, FYI, this filament is 10 EUR/kg :p
[01:47:46] <joepie91> (you do need to buy it per 10 rolls though, mixed colors possible)
[01:48:12] <joepie91> the spools are hilariously bad but the filament is great

[21:09:02] <evilgohan2> Maybe, just maybe, it would be a good idea to not allow users to post reviews to a movie / tv episode before it even releases / airs?
[21:09:14] <evilgohan2> Or does that make too much sense?
[21:09:52] <Frogging101> or just use your discretion when interpreting user reviews and ratings
[21:10:10] <Frogging101> If it hasn't released yet then the reviews are probably bogus, unreliable, or otherwise irrelevant
[21:10:43] <evilgohan2> The problem is that they skew the overall  reviews for something in perpetuity
[21:10:59] <evilgohan2> The entire proverbial well is fundamentally poisoned
[21:11:34] <Frogging101> Why'? Wouldn't their importance be drowned out by a much greater legitimate reviews
[21:11:46] <Frogging101> a much greater amount of legitimate reviews*
[21:12:11] <evilgohan2> Nope.

[21:12:52] <Frogging101> Why? Does the rating system favour reviews submitted earlier?
[21:12:59] <evilgohan2> No, recency bias does.
[21:13:31] <evilgohan2> Well, actually, ironically, yes. imdb assigns weight to some reviews more than others.
[21:13:39] <evilgohan2> But, also no. Recency bias the stronger determiner.

[21:13:49] <unfinity> The duck said no, maybe bribe it with some pizza? Ducks love pizza don't they? You can try again in 7 seconds.
[21:14:09] <Frogging101> Recency bias means the cognitive tendency to favour more recent information, right? Isn't that the opposite?
[21:14:51] <evilgohan2> In this context, recency bias refers to it attracting more people due to its prevalence in pop culture and media at this moment in time. Once that moment has passed, interest will wane.
[21:15:13] <evilgohan2> Most media gains its largest amount of interest near, at, and immediately after its release.
[21:15:52] <evilgohan2> Hypothetically speaking, if 50,000 people vote it 1.0 right now, 50,000 people can spend the next 5 fives rating it at a more realistic value and they'll still never overcome that initial review bomb
[21:16:14] <evilgohan2> the next five years***
[21:16:39] <Frogging101> Ah, I see

[21:16:55] <evilgohan2> Look at those votes.
[21:17:21] <evilgohan2> The vast majority of those came in the first several hours of that video being posted to YouTube.
[21:17:31] <Frogging101> Well, I don't think review/rating bombing can be solved in the way you suggest; they'll just wait until ratings can be posted
[21:17:57] <Frogging101> Also maybe the majority of viewers just feel that way
[21:18:15] <Frogging101> In which case the ratings accurately reflect the opinions of those who viewed it
[21:18:30] <evilgohan2> That wasn't from viewers, it was targeted review bombing from reactionaries for an unreleased series -- which is the same with Eternals. It was a pretty big topic at the time.
[21:18:44] <evilgohan2> and while it might not resolve it, it can mitigate it. At least in the context of imdb.
[21:19:41] <evilgohan2> imdb entries usually appear months in advance of a property's actual release. If you don't allow reviews until the actual theatrical release date, or the air date, then that would strongly mitigate reactionary review bombing - especially since the majority of it appears prior to a property's actual release.
[21:21:53] <Frogging101> Yeah, maybe. Though I can think of one legitimate use case for pre-release reviews; often there are pre-release screenings to smaller audiences
[21:22:10] <evilgohan2> That is true.
[21:22:27] <Frogging101> I don't know who such things are generally open to, but it's a semi-public thing
[21:22:44] <Frogging101> i.e. more than just people who know the producer or whatever
[21:23:04] <evilgohan2> It's more of a you can get in if you can get in kinda thing. Sometimes they're publically announced, sometimes the tickets are given away in contests, and others it's private.

[21:27:57] <evilgohan2> I guess maybe some verification system can be added, but I'd honestly rather wait until the actual theatrical date - even if that date is a limited release (i.e.: for a festival or something)
[21:28:38] <evilgohan2> To point: if a film releases in a limited theatrical run or at a festival, and it gets - say - more than 10,000 votes, that should be an immediate red flag that every review should be questioned.
