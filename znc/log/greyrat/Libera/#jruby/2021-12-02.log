[18:11:16] <headius> Good morning
[18:11:39] <headius> I have been calling the herd each time we release
[18:11:45] <headius> Culling
[18:12:05] <headius> enebo:  I'll have a look through the stuff marked for 9.2
[18:27:38] <headius> er
[18:27:39] <headius> enebo: https://github.com/jnr/jffi/pull/116
[18:27:42] <headius> https://github.com/jnr/jffi/pull/116#issuecomment-984083178
[18:28:03] <headius> not sure of the context because I confirmed the 1.3.8 native jar is published and contains the same stuff
[18:50:18] <enebo[m]> headius: 9.3
[18:51:19] <enebo[m]> We still have 17 open issues against 9.3.2.0 but we do we plan on moving all of them to 9.3.3.0
[18:51:38] <headius> I haven't gotten to look through them just yet
[18:51:41] <enebo[m]> I had my browser off to do some runs against new stftime
[18:51:50] <headius> each time I have punted I have detargeted some stuff along the way
[18:51:58] <headius> or moved to 9.4 as it made sense
[18:52:47] <enebo[m]> ok.  I looked a bit and nothing was obvious but with that said I am not sure how many will really be fixed
[18:53:51] <headius> there are still a lot of like-to-have in there
[18:59:13] <enebo[m]> https://gist.github.com/enebo/ac5ac6df607b5299ba2ba4198f89de36
[19:00:23] <headius> dat native logger ðŸ‘€
[19:00:34] <headius> numbers look great for strftime though
[19:00:42] <headius> need a nice bullet for this
[19:01:03] <enebo[m]> the native logger is them juist noticing /dev/null and doing nothing
[19:01:14] <headius> I wish GH had a mode where I can just "next" my way through an issue list
[19:01:14] <enebo[m]> I switched to /dev/null because I thought it would fake it out
[19:01:21] <headius> like JIRA does
[19:01:26] <headius> hah
[19:01:30] <headius> well that's silly
[19:01:36] <enebo[m]> I could softlink /dev/null maybe
[19:01:38] <headius> I suppose it is useful to someone
[19:01:49] <enebo[m]> it is useful to anyone who only turns this stuff on for dev
[19:01:50] <headius> benchmarkers
[19:02:11] <headius> if you want to go through these issues with me maybe we can make some decisions
[19:02:17] <headius> some are clearly bugs that we are just not jumping on fixing
[19:02:49] <headius> I have admittedly tended to target user bug reports right away so we try to fix them, but the ones we can't or just don't fix accumulate
[19:03:10] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6888
[19:03:24] <headius> module issue with the new super logic
[19:03:32] <headius> should be fixed, won't be soon
[19:03:36] <enebo[m]> 2.6 issue can float since it is just a reminder
[19:03:47] <headius> right I'll punt that now
[19:03:49] <enebo[m]> meaning we bump it until done
[19:05:08] <headius> I guess it is mostly the age old problem of how to know what to work on when there's 700 open issues
[19:05:19] <headius> I target stuff because it is more recent or old but recently re-reported
[19:06:36] <enebo[m]> Let's detarget https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6174
[19:07:15] <headius> the original issue was with io-console but it has been updated since to have a separate -java gem
[19:08:24] <enebo[m]> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6297
[19:08:55] <enebo[m]> This is more of an issue once we remove 8 as our flloor so we will hit it naturally once we get to that point (or someone complains)
[19:09:21] <headius> the remaining issues in 6174 are documented in a separate bug about some core classes requiring .rb code from the filesystem
[19:09:21] <headius> so I will close this
[19:09:49] <enebo[m]> oh cool even better
[19:09:50] <enebo[m]> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/3742
[19:10:17] <enebo[m]> I filed this and no one else has chimed in.  So this is annoying but let's detarget since we know it is substantial too
[19:10:40] <headius> the java 9+ issues should all get batched together because they're mostly the same work
[19:10:46] <enebo[m]> We used to work with our wrapper but it broke in the newer m17n and windows not using native io
[19:10:57] <headius> I will add a label for modules or something and move this to 9.4
[19:11:04] <headius> since we'll definitely have to have those fixed for 9.5
[19:11:18] <enebo[m]> ah yeah makes sense.  I half wonder if we detarget refinements but also make a module
[19:11:23] <enebo[m]> err a label
[19:12:19] <headius> yeah that is not a bad idea
[19:13:08] <headius> retargeting this for 9.3.3 since it is a PR with a fix but got lost in the noise: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6789
[19:13:39] <headius> it is a minor tweak to bash script but someone needs to just try it in the prescribed environment to tweak the module search
[19:13:46] <headius> also will tag with java modules label
[19:15:13] <enebo[m]> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6888
[19:15:43] <enebo[m]> I think unless you plan on working no this in the next month it is detargetted.  I find that unlikely with 3.0 as a priority
[19:16:08] <headius> punting this to 9.4 because nobody is responding and we will start using the updated ostruct gem in that version
[19:16:09] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6831
[19:16:12] <enebo[m]> There is a command-line/config workaround
[19:16:17] <headius> so hard deadline to fix
[19:16:33] <enebo[m]> sure
[19:16:48] <headius> I added module label to that super issue
[19:16:57] <headius> can detarget if you want, it was a byteit101 report so not from a user yet
[19:17:36] <enebo[m]> If byteit101 wants to work on it but he said something a week or so ago about being really busy.  He will get pinged so he can retarget if he is willing
[19:19:13] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/4840
[19:19:19] <headius> marked with refinements label and detargeted
[19:19:27] <headius> it is still broken fwiw
[19:19:40] <enebo[m]> I think I am going to retroactively make a feature issue with results for the strftime so it can just be a line item in out issue list
[19:19:49] <enebo[m]> yeah I also tried it this morning :)
[19:19:49] <headius> ok
[19:19:58] <enebo[m]> I was like "oh we changed something recently"
[19:20:09] <enebo[m]> this has to do with copying I think
[19:20:24] <enebo[m]> so it another form of teporal bug
[19:20:34] <headius> oh that's right
[19:20:41] <headius> I am copying the refinements rather than referencing them
[19:20:50] <headius> I think my impl was based on an earlier version of the logic
[19:21:09] <headius> perhaps something we fix along with other hierarchy logic changes in 3.0
[19:21:25] <enebo[m]> yeah since there are I think some behavioral changes to refinements in 3.0 too
[19:21:46] <enebo[m]> since we have to re-learn a bit it is a good opportunity to maybe fix both branches
[19:26:51] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6871
[19:27:10] <headius> may be an openssl issue since it is failing in a write there, but not many reports of problems
[19:27:28] <headius> I can transfer to jruby-openssl and maybe we can figure it out there
[19:27:38] <headius> I have not been able to reproduce pushing dummy gems
[19:29:49] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby-openssl/issues/242
[19:30:05] <enebo[m]> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6956
[19:30:14] <headius> cool
[19:30:32] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/5729
[19:30:35] <headius> I rebased that a while back but this is your baby
[19:30:39] <enebo[m]> I did not until this morning decide to take Time.now out of the benchmark
[19:31:10] <enebo[m]> I am willing to close this but I believe you also had another PR you thought would also work
[19:31:53] <headius> added label for fibers (plenty of issues in this area) and detargeting Benoit's issue
[19:32:35] <enebo[m]> ok and if you hit Fiber#raise (since it is a visible set of failing specs for 3.0) you probably will hit this 
[19:32:35] <headius> that is a pretty edge-casey issue anyway... fibers running in parallel after being forcibly terminated
[19:32:37] <headius> like, as they shut down
[19:32:45] <enebo[m]> well you might.  #raise has to shut down the fiber
[19:33:10] <headius> raise won't be any weirder than what we have now
[19:33:18] <enebo[m]> the error messaging also needs to know more than if it is alive...we also need to know if they are born but not yet running
[19:33:19] <headius> I already had to account for asynchronous raises in fibers
[19:33:44] <headius> pretty sure we are the only impl with thread-based fibers who even tries to handle them right
[19:34:40] <enebo[m]> I am going to release and push gem for 9.3.2.0
[19:34:50] <enebo[m]> it takes time for maven to propagate
[19:34:57] <enebo[m]> I found no issues testing yesterday
[19:36:25] <headius> ok
[19:36:35] <headius> I'm slowly reviewing issues
[19:42:53] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6673
[19:43:14] <headius> confirmed the version of IRB we ship does not show cause even for Ruby exceptions, so this is an IRB issue
[19:43:42] <headius> we can't really make IRB show cause if it doesn't look at cause
[19:45:18] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6813
[19:45:28] <headius> going to check this on M1 quick because newer jffi may load better there now
[19:46:27] <enebo[m]> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/1107
[19:47:48] <headius> heh, yeah that is probably long done... how did you get to that one?
[19:51:06] <enebo[m]> I just randomly clicked on a page
[19:53:01] <enebo[m]> I am updating website but we still need some release notes
[19:53:50] <headius> 6813 does seem to work for me on M1
[19:54:01] <headius> yeah you want notes or you want punts bro
[19:54:23] <enebo[m]> notes the punts
[19:54:24] <headius> 9 left open on 9.3
[19:54:25] <enebo[m]> s/the/then
[19:55:02] <enebo[m]> the punts stuff is just an ongoing activity too
[19:55:23] <enebo[m]> Like looking back at our issues I can see we probably have a few dead issues in there 
[19:55:47] <enebo[m]> It is almost amusing after all these years we seem to always have ~600 issues open
[19:56:21] <headius> load/require/FILE related issues marked with load/require label and detargeted
[19:56:31] <headius> we have gobs of dead issues
[19:56:45] <headius> I have not done a full triage for many years because it damn near killed me last time
[19:56:48] <headius> it's a lot of work
[19:57:50] <headius> marked kotlin issues with java integration label and detargeted
[19:58:20] <headius> detargeted my not quite working URI glob PR
[19:58:53] <headius> this looks like it could be finished if someone did a little footwork: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6444
[19:58:56] <headius> that's the last one
[19:59:00] <headius> I will look at notes now
[19:59:34] <headius> you don't want a bullet for strftime then?
[19:59:39] <enebo[m]> you already wrote up the security bit too
[19:59:53] <enebo[m]> I definitely do
[19:59:53] <headius> yeah you have my 9.3.1.1 security notes?
[19:59:56] <headius> ok
[20:00:26] <enebo[m]> I just also thought it should be an issue so it is something to be linked to
[20:03:01] <headius> most of these fixes were to get GHA CI working
[20:03:15] <headius> there's not much for callouts
[20:07:34] <headius> https://gist.github.com/headius/a22d20b2a0be02f512977ca0c52b2873
[20:07:38] <headius> I ain't got much else
[20:07:56] <headius> the prepend thing touches several issues but it seems like a pretty small item
[20:08:50] <enebo[m]> We maybe want to say something akin to: Short formats like "%Y-%m-%d" are ~5.8x faster while long strings like "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S.%9N" are ~3.5x faster.
[20:09:21] <headius> yeah I figured some flourish would be nicer, go ahead and add whatever you like
[20:09:25] <headius> it's your baby
[20:09:56] <enebo[m]> Maybe just "(3.5->5.8x improvement)"
[20:10:08] <enebo[m]> we have the links with results 
[20:10:14] <headius> "up to 8x improvement"
[20:10:19] <enebo[m]> although the first link shows time including Time.now
[20:10:28] <enebo[m]> HAHA add them!
[20:11:23] <headius> should I link your gist?
[20:11:36] <enebo[m]> naw.  I put it into a comment in the feature 
[20:11:47] <headius> ok
[20:11:57] <enebo[m]> I will just add that tiny bit of string into this
[20:15:10] <headius> I read wrong and you didn't say 8x so use the right number ðŸ˜€
[20:15:14] <headius> https://gist.github.com/headius/8ea4ddc4180e9f176ba2e0b20801419f
[20:15:21] <headius> updated that text a bit to say more about interruptible regexp
[20:15:34] <headius> so use that
[20:15:48] <headius> I will start preparing socials
[20:16:53] <enebo[m]> ok
[20:19:57] <headius> ready for the URL
[20:21:26] <enebo[m]> ok.  site and links look ok so I will push site and make GH release
[20:23:16] <headius> docker is pushed
[20:25:18] <enebo[m]> Site is live.  Will do emails after GH is done

[20:32:00] <headius> This PR is the only functional difference from JRuby 9.3.1.0.
[20:32:13] <headius> that was when I thought we were doing a 9.3.1.1
[20:32:15] <headius> socials going out
[20:33:27] <enebo[m]> fixed on site
[20:41:08] <headius> I think we're all set
[20:41:11] <headius> socials, docker, ruby installers done
[20:41:26] <headius> we should do another release tomorrow, I'm getting the hang of this
[20:42:05] <headius> I merged in the ruby-versions update (postmodern added me to repo yesterday) and the others are pending merge
[20:45:45] <enebo[m]> haha
[20:45:51] <enebo[m]> it could happen
[20:46:06] <enebo[m]> I don't release on Friday's but I do want to be off next week
[20:46:33] <headius> yeah be honest, you aren't gonna be working tomorrow
[20:46:54] <headius> I probably won't either but I want to revisit the kwargs stuff before I start to forget the pieces
[20:47:32] <enebo[m]> I do plan on workig on sprintf rewrite rest of week
[20:47:44] <enebo[m]> I won't finish but I will get it further
[20:47:50] <headius> hey why not, mo faster
[20:48:09] <headius> and less eye bleeding when we maintain it later
[20:48:36] <enebo[m]> it is already about 1/2 done
[20:50:06] <headius> then comes the bytecode JIT
[20:57:16] <headius> that ostruct issue is moving forward... Marc-Andre will modify it not to alias evals and such that we warn about
[20:57:23] <headius> which will resolve that json warning issue we punted
