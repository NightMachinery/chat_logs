[01:48:46] <DOMF> Anyone know if it's possible to transpose a song from major to minor in a DAW?
[01:49:04] <DOMF> (I'm using LPX but if it's possible in one it should be in all)
[01:49:05] <artao> i would say ...... sure, but not easily
[01:49:06] <artao> ?
[01:49:11] <artao> and it would likely depend on the DAW
[01:49:21] <artao> what's LPX
[01:49:28] *** Joins: seabre (~seabre@user/seabre)
[01:49:47] <artao> er .... wait .... audio or MIDI?
[01:49:49] <artao> MIDI yes
[01:49:52] <artao> audio probably not
[01:50:22] <artao> transposing from a major to minor would require changing intervals
[01:50:26] <DOMF> <artao> what's LPX <-- logic pro x
[01:50:29] <artao> those are "hard coded" into audio
[01:50:32] <artao> AH of course
[01:50:35] <DOMF> <artao> er .... wait .... audio or MIDI? <-- either, TBH
[01:50:58] <DOMF> and the interval thing I figured if you gave something a source and told it what key it was
[01:51:09] <DOMF> it would still be able to change the frequency of the 3rd in that key?
[01:51:21] <macrobat> midi should be easy enough and there are probably things that do that at the press of a button?
[01:51:25] <artao> i would imagine that with MIDI you could set the DAW to a specific key and then select all the MIDI notes and slightly move them, then they'd all snap to their new notes
[01:51:28] <DOMF> (like, probably with a plugin to do it like melodyne or something)
[01:51:47] <DOMF> I want to hear how a song sounds in minor
[01:51:50] <artao> audio tho? you'd have to do it by hand, IF it's even really possible

[02:33:38] <artao> DOMF> I wonder how the long term effects compare to diphenhydramine
[02:33:44] <artao> regarding what? hydroxyzine?
[02:33:58] <artao> hydroxyzine is a prescription antihstamine
[02:34:06] <DOMF> I'm aware what it is
[02:34:23] <DOMF> diphenhydramine is an OTC one (and the most commonly used antihistamine)
[02:34:23] <artao> fair nuf. most people aren't
[02:34:24] <artao> :)
[02:34:28] <artao> RIGHT
[02:34:32] <artao> i thought it sounded familiar
[02:34:33] <DOMF> long-term use has shown to lead to dementia 
[02:35:06] <DOMF> I'm wondering if long term hydroxyzine (as it's also a Gen-1 antihistamine) would avoid these potentials
[02:35:27] <DOMF> I'm specifically wondering because I was taking daily diphenhydramine until I found out about that 
[02:35:29] <artao> i see
[02:35:35] <DOMF> (for allergies)

[02:36:04] <artao> my worst allergy is eggs
[02:36:09] <artao> and i eat eggs. it's fine
[02:36:13] <DOMF> hydroxyzine is also like the best antihistamine for potentiation with opioids
[02:36:19] <artao> eggs, rabbit fur, and western water hemp
[02:36:21] <DOMF> the synergistic effect is *amazing*

[03:59:10] <DOMF> Man, midi channel stuff is frustrating
[03:59:20] <artao> sure can be indeed
[04:00:19] <artao> what issue(s) are you having?
[04:01:06] <artao> one thing i love about modern MIDI interfaced with computers is that in the DAWs you can specifically set thing to only get MIDI from specific equipment
[04:01:42] <artao> for instance: only listen to MIDI from my arturia minilab, even tho the keystep pro and korg sq-1 are also plugged in
[04:01:57] <artao> so you ultimately get way more than only the standard 16 MIDI channels
[04:02:05] <artao> it's 16 per piece of gear
[04:02:08] <artao> so that's cool
[04:03:05] <artao> the Korg Volca Sample can "hear" MIDI on several channels, and it "hears" .... and i still can't fucking realloy understand how it works LOL
[04:03:48] <artao> IIRC ch10 controls it as a typical drum machine and ch11 (&12?) can control it chromatically on a per-sample basis
[04:04:01] <artao> but it can also be addressed in a couple other ways
[04:04:05] <artao> it's confusing as hell

[04:05:38] <DOMF> <artao> what issue(s) are you having? <artao> one thing i love about modern MIDI interfaced with computers is that in the DAWs you can specifically set thing to only get MIDI from specific equipment <--- that's the EXACT ISSUE I AM HAVING
[04:05:44] <DOMF> so in LPX
[04:06:03] <DOMF> I want my kb to trigger omnisphere
[04:06:12] <DOMF> and my drums to drigger ezdrums
[04:06:19] <DOMF> (each as a sepearate instrument channel)
[04:06:51] <DOMF> I set the Midi Channel setting on the track inspector to all kinds of different channels
[04:07:21] <DOMF> I set my KB (an oxygen 8) to only transmit on channel 1, and my drums are set to channel 1, but the KB triggers the drums
[04:08:03] <LibertyDillo> artao> it's 16 per piece of gear << MotU interfaces have been doing that for decades.  They use 'cableing' so that a 8 channel MIDI interface will have 16 channels per instrument or 128 total channels, and you can network 4 of them together for a total of 512 channels
[04:08:55] <Panther> I set my course for the Hoth System.

[04:09:52] <artao> DOMF can you set the drums to only transmit MIDI, not receive it?

[04:13:00] <DOMF> so part of the problem artao 
[04:13:02] <artao> i don't think i've ever heard it. not heard much Yes
[04:13:08] <DOMF> I have no fucking clue how to set the midi channel on the drums
[04:13:14] <artao> ah
[04:13:17] <DOMF> you think it's passing through?
[04:13:18] <artao> that would be a problem
[04:13:25] <artao> google the manual?

[04:14:04] <DOMF> it might only transmit on channel 10 
[04:14:10] <DOMF> I don't know how to tell even
[04:14:19] <artao> hm
[04:14:25] <artao> search forums for the answer?

[04:15:09] <LibertyDillo> What's the maker and model, DOMF?
[04:15:20] <DOMF> no its fine I've just done all of this :( Still digging through links
[04:15:26] <DOMF> LibertyDillo it's an Alesis Crimson II kit
[04:15:32] <DOMF> usb into a MBP/LPX
[04:15:33] <LibertyDillo> Channel 10 is generally reserved for drums in the General MIDI spec
[04:15:42] <DOMF> yeah that's why I thought it might be hardcoded on 10
[04:15:52] <DOMF> manual does not say
[04:16:10] <artao> yeah
[04:16:12] <DOMF> the Oxygen 8 I'm not using USB because they long stopped having drivers in MacOS for it
[04:16:24] <DOMF> so I'm running midi out of that into my Focusrite 18i8
[04:16:27] <artao> perhaps you need a MIDI filter

[04:17:59] <DOMF> that'll let me do a bunch of midi ins

[04:18:17] <DOMF> I"m not convinced I'm doing this right in LPX, TBH
[04:18:18] <artao> dunno
[04:18:21] <DOMF> and I have to go now anyways
[04:18:28] <DOMF> but thx for the tips
[04:18:32] <LibertyDillo> "Accessing the module’s programs: You can use an external MIDI device (e.g., a MIDI keyboard or sequencer) to access the drum module’s other sound libraries (“programs”), such as piano, bass, strings, etc. Select a different program by sending a Program Change message from your external device. Each program uses a dedicated MIDI channel (1–16). Channel 10 is reserved for the drum sounds."
[04:19:03] <artao> yegads ... you have to use sysex?
[04:19:12] <sublim20> hey DOMF
[04:19:14] <sublim20> bad news
[04:19:18] <LibertyDillo> So yeah, to access the drum sounds themselves rather than the programs, you have to use Ch 10.
[04:19:19] <artao> SAY LibertyDillo ... do you understand nrpn stuff?
[04:19:23] <sublim20> they apparently discontinued camel turkish royals
[04:19:35] <sublim20> no nobody will ever know their delicious taste
[04:19:41] <sublim20> *now
[04:19:51] <LibertyDillo> I am unfamiliar with NRPN, but have bee using MIDI since the mid-80s
[04:19:53] <DOMF> GOOD
[04:19:57] <DOMF> fuck those things lol
[04:19:57] <artao> i /think/ my MIDI keyboards can use nrpn, and i'm pretty sure my softsynths can ...
[04:20:05] * sublim20 gasps
[04:20:12] <artao> and as i understand it, it can allow finer gradation in CC messages

[04:21:50] <LibertyDillo> 'instrument-specific' MIDI controllers
[04:22:01] <artao> yeah
[04:22:16] <LibertyDillo> Don't think I've ever had a MIDI device that used that
[04:22:18] <artao> pretty much "okay manufacturers. do whatever the fuck you want with these." LOL
[04:22:26] <artao> or they did and you didn't know
[04:22:26] <LibertyDillo> yeah, quite
[04:22:45] <LibertyDillo> outside of the MIDI CC specs
[04:23:03] <artao> i look forward to using MIDI 2 gear
[04:23:40] <LibertyDillo> I don't know of any released MIDI 2 devices yet, but the specs are a huge upgrade for sure
[04:23:58] <artao> or software that uses it for that matter
[04:27:53] <LibertyDillo> It'll happen eventually
[04:28:01] <artao> ja
[04:28:12] <artao> is polyphonic aftertouch midi 2?
[04:28:26] <artao> or was that "hacked" into midi 
[04:28:26] <LibertyDillo> No, that's old
[04:29:01] <LibertyDillo> I have 90s synths that will recognize poly, but have never had a keyboard that would generate it
[04:29:23] <LibertyDillo> the non-MIDI Yamaha CS-80 synth had poly aftertouch
[04:29:37] <LibertyDillo> that's late 70s keys
[04:30:03] <artao> ah
[04:30:15] <LibertyDillo> Tommy Mars of Zappa's band had one
[04:30:20] <LibertyDillo> as did Toto
[04:30:39] <artao> on my system 1-m i've found patches that can use aftertouch, but i can find no info on how to route it in my own patches
[04:30:46] <artao> ditto with modwheel or velocity
[04:31:01] <artao> it might be a case of "you have to buy our software to access that"
[04:31:14] <artao> i've discovered that Roland is rather an asshole there
[04:31:33] <artao> must have the software to access certain features on the hardware
[04:31:48] <artao> and either pay us 5usd per month or 100 outright for that sofware

[04:32:29] <artao> such a great fuckin synth
[04:32:35] <artao> i've got the arturia emulation
[04:32:44] <artao> i think it does a damn good job at the sound
[04:33:00] <artao> the Blade Runner sountrack man. awww yeah
[04:33:05] <LibertyDillo> A subscription service for music software?  ewwww
[04:33:06] <artao> almost entirely cs-80
[04:33:09] <artao> yeah
[04:33:17] <artao> i despise subscription software in general
[04:33:19] <artao> pisses me off
[04:33:53] <LibertyDillo> "It has exceptionally complete performer expression features, such as a layered keyboard that was both velocity-sensitive (like a piano's) and pressure-sensitive ("after-touch") but unlike most modern keyboards the aftertouch could be applied to individual voices rather than in common" << poly aftertouch
[04:34:10] <LibertyDillo> in 1977
[04:34:50] <artao> i didn't realize it was poly aftertouch
[04:35:15] <artao> i wonder if the arturia emulation is
[04:35:37] <artao> the way it can vary which patch is played per keypress is neato too
[04:35:43] <artao> not sure i stated that right
[04:37:09] <artao> or maye that's just the emulation
[04:38:57] <artao> the Oberheim Matrix 12 is pretty sweet too on a similar level to the CS-80
[04:39:13] <artao> SO cool his name was given back to him as a brand
[04:39:14] <LibertyDillo> Would love to have one
[04:39:22] <artao> just GIVEN to him!
[04:39:31] <LibertyDillo> It was the right thing to do :)
[04:39:46] <artao> dude who owned it was like, "Wait what? He's making synths and needs the brand name? Fuck yeah!! Here!!"
[04:39:48] <artao> <3
[04:39:49] <artao> yeah
[04:39:53] <artao> respect
[04:39:54] <LibertyDillo> cool
[04:40:32] <artao> the SEM emulation is nice. i even set up a template track with dual SEM
[04:41:07] <LibertyDillo> The poly-SEMs were very cool
[04:41:14] <artao> rather
[04:41:17] <artao> tho fuckin huge
[04:41:17] <artao> lol
[04:41:25] <LibertyDillo> they even made one that was a dual-manual 8-voice
[04:41:27] <artao> that's one he's making agin no?
[04:41:29] <LibertyDillo> oh yeah
[04:41:48] <LibertyDillo> Hadn't heard that they were going to make polys again

[04:44:42] <LibertyDillo> That's my biggest complaint with Behringer synths
[04:44:50] <artao> eh?
[04:45:03] <artao> just on the analog ones you can't. which is to be expected
[04:45:08] <artao> they've got several that can
[04:45:25] <artao> saving patches on analog synths is awkward
[04:45:39] <artao> cuz the knob position doesn't line up
[04:45:55] <LibertyDillo> Sure, if they're duplicating synths like the MiniMoog D or ARP 2600, you couldn't save programs with those
[04:45:56] <artao> two solutions to that are a) soft-latch knobs and b) touch sensitive endless encoders
[04:46:10] <artao> the latter being preferable. touch sensitive endles encoder are fuckina wesome
[04:46:28] <artao> any clones the do that can save patches originally stilld o
[04:46:39] <artao> and a couple of their own products can too
[04:46:52] <LibertyDillo> Well, I've got my Korg Prologue for that :)
[04:46:59] <sublim20> ive got my gun
[04:47:33] <LibertyDillo> and importantly, MIDI Quest has a profile for it so I can edit and set p bank libraries from software

[21:50:29] <DOMF> Does anyone happen to know how to tell, on a mac, what midi channel a controller is transmitting on?
[21:52:46] <DOMF> I"m still having a hell of a time trying to get different controllers simultaneously controlling different instruments
[21:56:56] <LibertyDillo> hmmm, I have programs which do that but I don't there's a system level utility
[21:57:08] <LibertyDillo> *don't think
[21:57:47] <LibertyDillo> There's a free program called MIDI Monitor that's really useful
[21:58:26] <LibertyDillo> Digital Performer has it's own built-in MIDI monitor module
[21:58:44] <LibertyDillo> Are you using a MIDI sequencer program DOMF?
[21:58:52] <DOMF> LPX
[21:59:08] <LibertyDillo> Don't know it, but you might see if it has such a utility
[21:59:12] <DOMF> I'll check out midi monitor
[22:00:38] <DOMF> OK that's VERY useful, thank you! 
[22:00:46] <DOMF> at least now I know that my problem is within LPX
[22:00:57] <DOMF> because this showed that my KB is transmitting on ch2 and my drums on ch10
[22:01:28] <FreeRangeDillo> Looks like MIDI Monitor will tell you what port but not what channel :/
[22:01:46] <FreeRangeDillo> Ah, OK
[22:02:43] <FreeRangeDillo> Yeah you'll need to set the controller to CH 10 to play the drums directly, from what I saw in the drum manual yesterday

[22:07:29] <DOMF> Midi Monitor told me what channel
[22:07:38] <DOMF> it gives the raw midi signal data
[22:07:39] <DOMF> for *
[22:07:53] <DOMF> drums are already set to 10 that's the default
[22:08:03] <DOMF> The way LPX handles midi channels is just mind bogglingly bad
[22:09:46] <FreeRangeDillo> OK, kewl
[22:10:50] <FreeRangeDillo> Ah yes I see that now in the data list
[22:11:05] <FreeRangeDillo> I was looking at the source data
[22:11:31] <FreeRangeDillo> Yeah MIDI Monitor is very handy for troubleshooting
[22:11:37] <FreeRangeDillo> lots of data filters

[23:05:00] <DOMF> macrobat that's not the problem cause MIDI monitor shows drums coming in on 10 and KB coming in on 2
[23:05:13] <DOMF> my current problem is limiting each instrument in LPX to those channels only
