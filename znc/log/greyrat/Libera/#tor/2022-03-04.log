[23:21:00] <latenite> Hi folks, could you help me getting the tor-browser to work?
[23:21:19] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[23:21:26] <latenite> I downloaded and started it, but I can not get to open up the website I need.
[23:24:44] <xx> the website might be blocking tor connections
[23:24:56] <xx> click that button on the top right to make a new tor circuit
[23:25:01] <xx> or close and reopen tor browser
[23:26:46] <latenite> I tried both, and I keep getting an info page of rt.com that sais: ...
[23:26:53] <latenite> wft, NOW it works.
[23:27:01] <latenite> just at the moment I am asking here
[23:27:04] <xx> yeah sometimes you just have to keep trying until it works
[23:27:11] *** Joins: crashrep (~crashrep@user/crashrep)
[23:27:13] <latenite> I did just restart it. the 5th time
[23:27:32] <latenite> why would it not work 100% of the time? What are the reasons?
[23:27:32] <xx> lots of tor exit nodes are located in countries that have chosen to block rt.com
[23:27:46] <xx> so you need to wait until you randomly get an exit node that doesn't block it
[23:28:02] <xx> work is being done on dealing with this but it will take time
[23:28:43] <latenite> Can I pre-select exit nodes before connecting?
[23:28:52] <latenite> e.g. have list of good nodes
[23:29:22] <xx> it's possible on the technical level, but not advised
